00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:50,978
<i>In the land of Sparta...</i>

3
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,282
<i>when babies were born...</i>

4
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,016
<i>the elders would
inspect them for defects.</i>

5
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,584
BABY
Ah. Are you my mama?

6
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,925
'Cause I'm ready to suckle a teat.

7
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,436
<i>If any imperfections were found...</i>

8
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:17,942
<i>the baby was rejected.</i>

9
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,412
<i>And if the baby...</i>

10
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,575
<i>was Vietnamese...</i>

11
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:27,313
<i>Brangelina had first dibs.</i>

12
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,249
Cute, huh?

13
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,860
<i>Behold Leonidas...</i>

14
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,420
Ah-ooh!

15
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:41,194
<i>...the perfect Spartan.</i>

16
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,240
<i>From an early age...</i>

17
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,970
<i>Leonidas was taught to fight.</i>

18
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,807
Come on, you little shit! Come on!

19
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,369
You can't beat me.

20
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,937
You're never gonna be
a Spartan, never.

21
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,539
Take this, Granny!

22
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,881
Aah!

23
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:06,389
<i>He was tortured,
taught to show no pain.</i>

24
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,450
Tell me, Mr. Bond...

25
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,120
what is the account number?

26
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:12,630
Who the hell is Mr. Bond?

27
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,291
I'm Leonidas.

28
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,301
You're testing my patience,
Double-Oh.

29
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,337
But I am not Double-

30
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:19,632
Oh!

31
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,635
Oh!

32
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,473
Little Miss Sunshine!

33
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:28,378
Oh, oh-

34
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,417
Here's a nice one. Oh-

35
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,180
That's right. Yeah.

36
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,348
No, no, no.

37
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:42,586
Mr. Bond, I'd like you
to meet Captain Adorable.

38
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,629
Good boy.

39
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,324
Good boy.
Who's a good boy?

40
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,868
<i>Leonidas was sent into the wild...</i>

41
00:02:56,943 --> 00:03:00,310
<i>to learn how to survive.</i>

42
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,483
<i>He braved the elements...</i>

43
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,580
<i>endured starvation.</i>

44
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:19,823
No mayo?

45
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,561
This is bullshit!

46
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,939
<i>The beast stalks Leonidas...</i>

47
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:33,172
<i>red eyes glowing
like the fires ofhell.</i>

48
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,756
Man, you've got happy feet.

49
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,697
What you laughin' at, asswipe?

50
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,102
I'm about to shove
my happy foot up your ass...

51
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,606
- cracker.
- Nice penguin.

52
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,801
Where you going, pussy?

53
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,776
I'm 'bout to make you
my bitch, Leonidas.

54
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,372
Lick my snowballs.

55
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:19,186
Now eat my penguin asshole.

56
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,193
That Taco Bell ain't sittin' right.

57
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,624
Oh, it smells!

58
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,631
Ha! Caught you with your mouth open.

59
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,712
You dead, Leonidas.

60
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,112
Say "Wassup?"
To Anna Nicole for me.

61
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,682
Shit! I'm stuck!

62
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,723
Oh, we got a penguin pinned down!

63
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,223
Help! Help!

64
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,223
Oh! My ass!

65
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,201
My ass hurt! Oh!

66
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,736
Why you wanna do me like that?

67
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,897
Come on, man, I could hook you up.

68
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,133
We could work it out.

69
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,698
I'll suck your dick!

70
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:18,181
<i>And the boy
that was cast into the wild...</i>

71
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:21,118
<i>returned a king!</i>

72
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,207
# Oh! #

73
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,176
#Yeah, yeah #

74
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:46,506
#Ak' sizzle #

75
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,103
- #The bomb #
- # Get down #

76
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,240
# Baby, down,
I know you love the sound #

77
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,943
#When we do what we do #

78
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,509
- #We get you in the mood #
- #Ak'Sent's in the building #

79
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,851
- # Pick it up, pick it up #
- #Yeah #

80
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,447
- # I know you love the feel #
- # Come on #

81
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,151
# Let's keep it on the real #

82
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,319
#This... is like the bomb #

83
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,623
- # So fresh #
- Whoa!

84
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,186
#The bomb, so dope #

85
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:06,663
#The bomb, so def #

86
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,462
- #The bomb #
- Boobs.

87
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,832
# So cool, the bomb, so fresh #

88
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,268
#The bomb, so dope #

89
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,270
#The bomb #

90
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,330
Sign my rack?

91
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,035
# So cool #

92
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,634
And they're real, too.

93
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,474
Yes!

94
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,944
Marry me?

95
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,984
What's that?

96
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,426
The combination to my chastity belt.

97
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,559
Oh-

98
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,000
Leonidas!

99
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:59,015
<i>Leonidas was stoked.</i>

100
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:03,988
<i>He wed Margo,
and she bore him a fine son.</i>

101
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:07,822
<i>And life in the land
of Sparta was good.</i>

102
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,191
Yes! Yes! Good!

103
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,493
Thanks, Dad.

104
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,193
Give me your hand.

105
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,036
Remember, Son: A warrior...

106
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,735
must learn to take a hit.

107
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:28,006
Fight with your head;

108
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,877
think with your heart.

109
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:30,916
Huh?

110
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,917
Give him the pile driver, honey.

111
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,046
Pile driver?

112
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,423
That's my boy.

113
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,327
My queen.

114
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,428
No!

115
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,938
- Captain.
- No!

116
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,770
I see Leonidas is molding
our future king of Sparta...

117
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,242
to be a man.

118
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,911
I remember when
my father used to beat me.

119
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,252
Traditional rites of passage.

120
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,748
No. My father was an alcoholic.

121
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,122
Ow!

122
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,827
Xerxes' messenger awaits, my king.

123
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,439
Greetings, Leonidas.

124
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,136
Greetings, messenger.

125
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,780
What the hell was that?

126
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:36,780
What?

127
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,941
You just kissed me!

128
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,009
That is how men of Sparta
greet one another.

129
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,487
High fives for the women...

130
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,354
and open-mouth tongue
kisses for the men.

131
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,699
Ooh.

132
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,134
I get it.

133
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,193
Get what?

134
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,866
Uh... y-you have a...

135
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,772
"free society" here.

136
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,004
Yes. The freest.

137
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,807
Uh, not that there's
anything wrong with that.

138
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,279
I dig big black dudes.

139
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:17,788
Yeah.

140
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:22,658
Come, messenger, let us walk.

141
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,867
The great Xerxes has
taken over the world...

142
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,698
with his vast Persian army...

143
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,933
and has set his sights
on his final conquest-

144
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,496
Sparta.

145
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,812
Let us talk
by the giant pit of death.

146
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,473
Okay.

147
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,312
Xerxes is a kind god-king...

148
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:46,817
and offers these...

149
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,184
peaceful alternatives to war.

150
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,020
No blood will be shed...

151
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,186
as long as you Spartan
men build his pyramids...

152
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,823
your women become his sex slaves...

153
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,628
and your children...

154
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,430
work at sweatshops...

155
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,265
making Nikes.

156
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,440
That sounds reasonable.

157
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,770
I'm sure you would...

158
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,744
think so, Councilman Traitoro.

159
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,570
Tell Xerxes...

160
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,077
...to take his proposal...

161
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,310
and shove it!

162
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,080
What the hell?!

163
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,212
What? He came on to me!

164
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:57,482
I did not.

165
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,751
Dawg, your wife's a ho.

166
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,158
This means war!

167
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,425
Hey, hey, hey, it's cool, it's cool.

168
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,023
Uh, we got San Francisco...

169
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,328
and West Hollywood.

170
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,336
We don't need Sparta.

171
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,634
I'll just tell Xerxes
it's a "no go. "

172
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,911
Kick his ass in.

173
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,145
This is madness!

174
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,244
Madness?

175
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,822
This is Sparta!

176
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,298
Why did you do that?

177
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,666
He was backing down.

178
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:51,609
My lord, he will
tell Xerxes that Sparta...

179
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,645
is not for them,
so, whatever you do...

180
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,374
don't kick him
into the pit of death.

181
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,973
Stop kicking people
into the pit of death. Really!

182
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,812
# Oh, no #

183
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,513
# Oh, yeah #

184
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,113
# Uh-huh, yeah. #

185
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,385
I don't know why y'all...

186
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,723
have to always get on
my back for everything.

187
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,386
I'm a responsible adult.

188
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,488
Look at me-
I'm booby-feeding my baby.

189
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,396
Sometimes I like to
give him fried milk.

190
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,661
I call 'em milk poppers.

191
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,963
It's just like breast milk,
but it's fried.

192
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,264
And you just pop 'em in your mouth.

193
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:19,395
He loves 'em.
Don't you, baby!

194
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,633
# Goo-goo, gah-gah #

195
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:24,574
# Gah-gah, gah-gah-gah-gah. #

196
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,341
I'm a smart shopper.

197
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,247
I got this entire outfit in
an alleyway from a Mexico woman.

198
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,443
# Bargain #

199
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,678
# Shopping #

200
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,050
#Yeah. #

201
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,679
Why do y'all think I'm messed up?

202
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,247
Shit! Do I look crazy to you?

203
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:47,231
Oh...

204
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,995
my God!

205
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:51,829
Aw, damn, cuz!

206
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,303
There goes my palimony!

207
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,964
K- Fed ain't havin' it, yo.

208
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,372
K- Fed, come back to me, please!

209
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,843
Please? I'll let you under my skirt.

210
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:01,539
There goes K-Fed's cheddar, yo.

211
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,050
# Oh, yeah! #

212
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,315
#Ah-ah-ah, yeah! #

213
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:12,824
# Ooh-ooh-ooh! #

214
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,189
#Yeah! #

215
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:16,895
#Yeah! #

216
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:22,056
# I'm not gay! #

217
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,267
Leonidas.

218
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,566
Ryan Seacrest?

219
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,337
How did you feel about that kick?

220
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,004
Let's see what the judges
have to say.

221
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,013
- Randy?
- Yo, Leo, dawg, man...

222
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,879
I, I wasn't really feelin' you
on that kick, dawg.

223
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,851
I don't know what happened, man.

224
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,717
It was just
all right for me, dawg.

225
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:45,450
- I mean, just all right, dawg.
- Paula?

226
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:49,255
Leonidas...

227
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,853
you...

228
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,694
move me.

229
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,427
Y-

230
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,966
I don't-

231
00:13:59,038 --> 00:13:59,970
Simon?

232
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,097
Leonidas...

233
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,641
I thought the kick...

234
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:07,042
was utterly... dreadful.

235
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,136
Oh... Simon-

236
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,579
In fact, I've seen better kicks...

237
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,275
from a geriatric donkey.

238
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,442
Oh-

239
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,543
And I'm not talking
about you, Paula.

240
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,054
I am sorry, King...

241
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:21,525
but your journey ends here.

242
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,660
Oh, go yourselves!

243
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,893
What are y?

244
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:53,186
Seacrest out!

245
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,284
Excellent work, my king.

246
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:58,728
It's time to consult
with the prophets.

247
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,372
<i>The ancient prophets
were advisers to the king.</i>

248
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:20,908
<i>Grotesque swine, their consult
came with a bribe.</i>

249
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,191
Oh. Oh, Oxy 10.

250
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,352
Oh, Neutrogena.

251
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,895
This has an SPF.

252
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,225
Th-This is all-day protection.

253
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,856
Look at this.

254
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,525
Exfoliator with alpha hydroxy.

255
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,568
This is good for you, Glenn.

256
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,603
Rub it all over
your disgusting face.

257
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,569
What need you, King Leonidas?

258
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,075
Ancient prophets...

259
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,044
I need your guidance.

260
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,741
I'm assembling an army
of 300 to go to war with Persia.

261
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:55,185
I'm going to take them in the rear.

262
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,484
Here, here.

263
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,524
And then I'm gonna reach around...

264
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,785
...and I'm gonna take them again
from the front!

265
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:05,929
What?!

266
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,295
Why are you sniggering?!

267
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,061
Nothing.

268
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,658
It's- no-nothing-

269
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,034
What's so damn funny?!

270
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,039
Look, it's all there for you to see!

271
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:16,438
These are battle formations!

272
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,440
Battle form-

273
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,635
That's what he calls them!

274
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:22,203
It looks like backstage
at an Elton John concert!

275
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,441
Cut it out!
This isn't funny!

276
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,005
This is serious business!

277
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,312
No Spartan goes to war...

278
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,617
without first consulting...

279
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,850
the oracle!

280
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,403
<i>The prophets chose
only the most beautiful...</i>

281
00:16:55,481 --> 00:17:00,544
<i>of Spartan girls to be their oracle.</i>

282
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,316
Oh-

283
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,085
Ugly Betty?

284
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,558
She has a great personality.

285
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,190
Eww!

286
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,630
I look likeJabba the Hutt.

287
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,065
That is hot to me.

288
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:37,412
Oh-

289
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,950
See-nah skah-nah...

290
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:43,290
labwana no-cho dame.

291
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,763
"Fo' shizel my nizzel. "

292
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:53,271
"Save the cheerleader...
save the world. "

293
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:56,068
<i>Actually, I'm, I'm not into Heroes.</i>

294
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:58,234
"Douche bag says what?"

295
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,106
What?

296
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,407
"Chest waxer says what?"

297
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,382
What?

298
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:10,381
He walked into that one.

299
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,651
What, what are you saying to me?
I don't understand.

300
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:15,989
Go to war with Persia
and you will surely die.

301
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:21,656
You're screwed, dude.

302
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:47,883
What?!

303
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:54,566
He looks like a Ken doll!

304
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,599
It's cold!

305
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,590
Tommy Lee?

306
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,297
Shaq?

307
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,434
Borat?

308
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,071
Oakland Raiders?

309
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,377
Why is my king so restless?

310
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:44,745
Can't sleep.

311
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:48,684
It's this whole Battle
ofThermopylae thing.

312
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:52,656
Are you still thinking about
what that young oracle said?

313
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,990
There's only one woman whose
words you should listen to.

314
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,321
Oprah.

315
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,695
Your wife?

316
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,859
Right, right.

317
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,130
How will I be tried...

318
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,796
in the court of public opinion?

319
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:11,837
Well, Harry Knowles
at "Ain't It Cool News"...

320
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,471
<i>says this movie is just
a cheap rip-off of 300.</i>

321
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:25,018
Even if the oracle
doesn't support you, I do.

322
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,388
And Sparta does.

323
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,484
This could be
our last night together.

324
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,154
You wanna do it?

325
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,131
Like we've never done it before.

326
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,823
...97... 98...

327
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,360
...99...

328
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,986
100!

329
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:08,123
Beat my record.

330
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,398
Captain.

331
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:16,736
My king.

332
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,044
Have you assembled
my army who are ready...

333
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,985
to fight to the death
for the freedom of Sparta?

334
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,180
Yes, King.

335
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,159
I wanted 300.

336
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,995
This seems like... less.

337
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,001
These were the only men
who met with your stringent...

338
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,003
specifications.

339
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,335
"Hunky with deep
Mediterranean tans...

340
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,806
"hot bods... "

341
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,775
and, uh...

342
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:52,673
Yes?

343
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,006
"... well endowed. "

344
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,341
Haawoo! Haawoo!

345
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:56,540
Haawoo!

346
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,173
Ready to fight for you, my king!

347
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,218
Never give up!
Never surrender!

348
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:03,448
To infinity and beyond!

349
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,751
He has a lot of heart, my king.

350
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,487
And nice man boobs.

351
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,593
Indeed.

352
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,932
These men will do.

353
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,872
You are a fine captain, Captain.

354
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:26,104
But a better friend...
there is none.

355
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,805
Thank you.

356
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:43,989
Thank you.

357
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:45,120
Mm-hm.

358
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,129
Damn!

359
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:50,401
He's got a huge package.

360
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,004
I brought you some fudge.
Mom said that you like to pack it.

361
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,805
She's a good woman.

362
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,971
Good-bye, Father.

363
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,409
Farewell, my son.

364
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,412
Introductions?

365
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,818
King Leonidas,
this is my son, Sonio.

366
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,412
My king.

367
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,924
Why is he not fighting?

368
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,186
Well, he is not a warrior.

369
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,454
And he's my only son...

370
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,996
destined to carry on my name.

371
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,190
What do you think?

372
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,360
Yummy.

373
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,427
Work it, sister.

374
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,598
I think he's fierce.

375
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:31,566
# Come and give it 2 me #

376
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:34,544
#You know you want my body,
need my body #

377
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:35,841
# Show me them goodies... #

378
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,176
And if you don't like it...

379
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,774
you can kiss my fat ass!

380
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,020
Ooh!
Oh!

381
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,020
#... Watchin' your curves #

382
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,078
#Thinking of words, baby #

383
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,124
# My vision is blurred... #

384
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,182
Congratulations, Sonio.

385
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,319
You're now on your way
to becoming Sparta's...

386
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:51,828
Next top warrior!

387
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:52,864
#... right where my mind is #

388
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,592
# Gimme your goody
and your body #

389
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:55,894
# Uh! Come and give it 2 me #

390
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,231
#You know you want my body,
need my body #

391
00:23:58,303 --> 00:23:59,930
# Show me them goodies #

392
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:03,065
#You're gonna love my body,
touch my body... #

393
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:04,836
Spartan!

394
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,052
My child...

395
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,384
I shall never forget you.

396
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,788
You are so small now...

397
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:23,191
but one day you will grow
to be big and strong...

398
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,558
like your father.

399
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,994
That's not your son.

400
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,497
You asshole.

401
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,366
Take care of your mother.

402
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,505
Stay tough, Son.

403
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,388
Come back with your shield...

404
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,287
or on it.

405
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:56,885
And if I come back on it,
I want you to move on.

406
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,930
I would never.

407
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,090
Hell, if you died,
I'd play the field.

408
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,690
To be honest...

409
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:06,203
I've always wanted
to do a fat chick.

410
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,601
The men are ready, my king.

411
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:39,933
Good. We'll head south
to the Hot Gates...

412
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,269
where we'll intercept
the Persian army.

413
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,705
Where are you going?

414
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:46,744
The oracle said if we went
to war, we'd be screwed.

415
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:51,373
The oracle also said that
our painted-on abs look fake.

416
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,314
But I beg to differ.

417
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:04,086
Give the order, Captain.

418
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:07,757
Spartans! In formation!

419
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,163
Ah-ooh!

420
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,101
Spartans heading south.

421
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:21,175
Move out!

422
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,573
# Oh, no, not I #

423
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,379
# I will survive #

424
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:30,216
# Oh, as long
as I know how to love #

425
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,119
# I know I'll stay alive #

426
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,021
# I've got all my life to live #

427
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,151
# I've got all
my love to give #

428
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,888
#And I'll survive #

429
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:40,158
# I will survive #

430
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:42,028
# Hey, hey #

431
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,727
Woo!

432
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,544
# I'll survive #

433
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,478
# I will survive #

434
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,675
# I will survive! #

435
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,342
#Yeah #

436
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:01,476
# Ooh... #

437
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,180
<i>The fearless Spartans...</i>

438
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:05,950
<i>reached the Hot Gates...</i>

439
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:09,687
<i>where danger lurked
around every corner.</i>

440
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:14,394
Halt skipping!

441
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,070
<i>Exhausted from thejourney...</i>

442
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:24,040
<i>the Spartans replenished
their electrolytes.</i>

443
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,915
<i>Gatorade. Is it in you?</i>

444
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:42,425
What do you think, my king?

445
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,122
We'll use the narrow
passageway of the Hot Gates...

446
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,993
to funnel the Persians in...

447
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:50,466
where their vast numbers
won't count for shit.

448
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:53,060
Captain, have the men found
any other trails...

449
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,538
that the Persians
could use to attack us?

450
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,040
None, sir.

451
00:27:57,108 --> 00:28:00,635
WOMAN
I know such a road, my king.

452
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,986
Back off, hideous creature.

453
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,216
There's a secret goat path
just above the Hot Gates.

454
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,884
If the Persians found it,
they could outflank you.

455
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,426
Slow your roll, Captain.

456
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:20,287
Reveal yourself, creature.

457
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,329
Paris Hilton?

458
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:26,427
Hey, fellas.

459
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:27,994
What happened to you?

460
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,564
Oh.
You mean the hump?

461
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,167
Yeah. The hump.

462
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,007
It was all that,
"You're going to jail.

463
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,604
"Now you can get out of jail.

464
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:37,978
Now you're going back to jail. "

465
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,314
And on and on and on and on- Ugh.

466
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,081
It's just been really confusing.

467
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,213
I mean, even Tinkerbell's
affected by it.

468
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,655
She hasn't moved since Saturday.

469
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,625
But she still poops, which is weird.

470
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,251
And me...

471
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,956
they've turned me into this, like...

472
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:55,625
totally grotesque monster!

473
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,668
And I don't
even know... oh.

474
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,761
# Do tha hump-de-hump... #

475
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,829
Hang on a minute.

476
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:05,171
Oh-

477
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,268
Hello?

478
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:08,505
Oh, hey, Nicole.

479
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,514
Nothing. Just some guys with swords.

480
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,709
No, I'm talking about their
actual swords, Nicole.

481
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,046
You're gross.

482
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,711
Yeah, I'm hungry.
Did you eat?

483
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,152
Oh, you ate an almond?

484
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,315
Oh, yeah, you're done
eating for the day.

485
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:22,325
Okay. And then let's go to Pinkberry.

486
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:23,553
Bye, sexy.

487
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,157
Look...

488
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,666
it's my dream to be a Spartan.

489
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:35,036
I want to fight for you,
my king.

490
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:41,545
- What can you do?
- Well- Mmm.

491
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:45,276
Have you seen my video?

492
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,683
I don't like the way
you handle a spear.

493
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:51,551
You grip the shaft firmly.

494
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,750
Then with one hand on the base...

495
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:57,124
you slide the other
all the way up to the tip.

496
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:01,060
That's hot.

497
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:05,759
I'm sorry,
but we cannot use you.

498
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:08,967
No!

499
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,235
It's not fair!

500
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:14,904
Mom!

501
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:21,349
You'll be sorry!
You're making a terrible mistake!

502
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:26,117
I'm not as stupid as I look!

503
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,223
Help.

504
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,420
Look! Persians!

505
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:16,336
I am the emissary
to the great god-king Xerxes...

506
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,932
come to accept your surrender.

507
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,205
Oh, we're not here to surrender.

508
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,439
Haawoo!

509
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,311
Xerxes will enjoy making you
his slaves.

510
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,300
Ow.

511
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,367
Spartans!

512
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:55,173
Yah!

513
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,077
Let's battle!

514
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,915
Oh, we about to stomp the yard.

515
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,814
SPARTANS
We are the Spartans.

516
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,252
We stomp the yard.

517
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,386
Check out our buns.

518
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:14,090
They are rock hard.

519
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:17,566
Ooh, ooh.

520
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,500
Spartans!

521
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,537
Yeah!

522
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:27,667
Persians!

523
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,804
Let's show 'em
why we're national champs...

524
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,280
three years runnin'.

525
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:32,373
You dig?

526
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,848
Oh, come on.

527
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:43,587
We like wearing
turbans and eating baklava.

528
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:45,458
We like chicks with burkas...

529
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,020
that cover their ta-tas.

530
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:50,192
Ooh, ah! Ooh, ah!

531
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,634
Persians, huh!

532
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,598
You're joking, right?

533
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,113
Man, come on.

534
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:06,707
- #You gotta shake your ass #
- Let's go!

535
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,115
# Shake your tambourine #

536
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:09,813
# Go and get yourself a whistle,
shake your tambourine #

537
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,650
# Go and get yourself
a whistle #

538
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:12,781
# Shake your tambourine... #

539
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:13,881
# Ladies! #

# Shake your tambourine... #

541
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:16,887
- # Ladies! #

542
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:22,724
# Shake, shake, shake, shake #

543
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,926
# Shake your tambourine... #

544
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,629
# Ladies and gentlemen #

545
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:27,102
# E-V-E come through

546
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,332
# Doin' it big like I live

547
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:30,339
Yeah!

548
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:37,406
#That's real, been the chick
that they talked about #

549
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:40,417
# "God damn" is the words
that come out they mouth... #

550
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:41,577
Oh-

551
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:42,641
#Ask for her #

552
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,948
#Yeah, she back

553
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,785
- # Ladies! #
- # Shake your tambourine... #

554
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,892
Oh, please, take a hike.

555
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,564
# Shake your tambourine,
go and get yourself a whistle #

556
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:03,664
# Shake your tambourine, go
and get yourself a whistle #

557
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,800
#They be watchin' while we wiggle around
Look at 'em droolin' #

558
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,812
# Niggas ain't used to this sound
I keep 'em movin' #

559
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,780
# Put your hands in the air
It's all right now #

560
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:12,372
#We gonna keep you up

561
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,611
# Now pop them bottles
Yeah, drink that up #

562
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,249
Yeah!

563
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,950
# Get low, get low, then

564
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:53,820
# Hands in the air,

565
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:54,880
# Shake your tambourine... #

566
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,328
# Shake it to the floor,

567
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,628
# How she keep it going on,

568
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,895
#To the beat like a pro,
know you love dat #

569
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:07,802
Oh!

570
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,874
Don't come up in my kitchen...

571
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,107
with that weak-ass shit.

572
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:18,808
#You gotta shake your ass #

573
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:21,249
# Shake your tambourine, go
and get yourself a whistle and #

574
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:24,083
# Shake your tambourine, go and
get yourself a whistle and #

575
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,952
# Shake your tambourine, go
and get yourself a whistle and #

576
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,388
# Shake your tambourine... #

577
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,755
# Shake your tambourine, go
and get yourself a whistle and #

578
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:37,267
Eee! Ooh!

579
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:42,906
You got served!

580
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,788
You telling me we lost?

581
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:07,023
Dance them to the cliffs!

582
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:08,793
No mercy!

583
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:10,390
Come on, man,
can we talk about this?

584
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:11,958
Yo, I just met
these dudes right here.

585
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:12,968
I don't even know them.

586
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:16,336
Onward! Keep dancing, boys!

587
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:37,022
- Last one in is a rotten egg!
- Cannonball!

588
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:38,254
Marco!

589
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:44,160
Polo!

590
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,400
Hyah!

591
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:53,004
We may have won the battle,
but they will win the war!

592
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:54,510
Hyah! What?

593
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,811
Buttmeister presents...

594
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,907
"Real Men of Genius. "

595
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:02,509
# Real men of genius! #

596
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,020
Today we salute you...

597
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:06,556
Mr. Warmongering Latent Homosexual.

598
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:10,025
# Mr. Warmongering
Latent Homosexual! #

599
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:12,426
Wearing nothing but
leather underwear and a cape...

600
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:15,522
you charge your enemy like
an oiled-up hairless wonder.

601
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,592
# Spray-on tan! #

602
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,034
Sure, there's danger-

603
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:22,072
charging rhinos,
stampeding elephants...

604
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:26,098
and that cute toga-wearing guy
named Chad.

605
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:27,474
# Ooh! #

606
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,240
You only went out on one date...

607
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:30,541
but you'll remember it...

608
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,583
Forever, forever...

609
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,551
#Take your daily Valtrex! #

610
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,714
Your keen instincts tell you
to cut, slice and chop...

611
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,416
every man you see.

612
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:43,119
But enough about your career
as a hair stylist...

613
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,923
let's talk war.

614
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:47,624
# Ow! That curling
iron is hot! #

615
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:50,166
So this Butt's for you,
King Leonidas...

616
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,065
because when the going gets tough...

617
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:53,797
the tough go antiquing.

618
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:58,308
# Mr. Warmongering
Latent Homosexual... #

619
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,510
#Yeah. #

620
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,404
Queen Margo...

621
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:06,507
we must speak.

622
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,382
Loyalist, what do you want?

623
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,524
Nice tomatoes.

624
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:18,153
Your husband needs you.

625
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,691
You must convince the council...

626
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,166
to send more troops
to support your husband.

627
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,725
My husband is dead.

628
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,566
He told me to move on.

629
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,539
Besides, I'm already
registered on J Date.

630
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,235
A little to the right.

631
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,709
That's it.

632
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:36,474
If Leonidas fails,
Xerxes will take over...

633
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:39,175
and you will be stripped
of your crown.

634
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,684
I won't be queen?

635
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,845
Ow! That's too hard.

636
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,684
You will lose everything.

637
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,747
Ow! Ooh, stop.

638
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,191
Your palace, your Mercedes...

639
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:51,387
Hi-yah!

640
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,259
- Ow!
... your Nintendo Wii...

641
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,423
No, no, no, no, no.

642
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,590
Ow!

643
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,032
...your vaginal regeneration surgeon...

644
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,364
Hi... yah!

645
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:00,699
...your gardener.

646
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,604
Antonio?

647
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,322
My husband needs me.

648
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,986
I'll do whatever it takes.

649
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:26,222
I will set...

650
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,026
the meeting with the council.

651
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,999
But in order to win their vote...

652
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:32,934
you will need to get
Traitoro's support.

653
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,336
He holds great influence...

654
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,171
with the council.

655
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:43,139
There better be a happy ending.

656
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:55,118
King Leonidas!

657
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:56,784
Xerxes approaches.

658
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,159
<i>Xerxes.</i>

659
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,461
<i>He looked a lot like
that fat guy from Borat.</i>

660
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:11,202
I am the great god-king Xerxes.

661
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:13,340
Ooh!

662
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,779
Ow, ow, ow!

663
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:19,611
Not again!
That always happens.

664
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:22,443
Ow!

665
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:26,615
Whew!

666
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,866
Damn!

667
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:46,737
- Oh, s-sorry, Xerxes.
- It's cool.

668
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,506
It's cool, cool. I'm fine.

669
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,570
I meant to do that.

670
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,247
Oh, shit!

671
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,944
I'll tell you, kid, you got balls.

672
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,611
I come over here with a big army.

673
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:58,245
We going to shish kebab your ass.

674
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,984
Before this battle is over...

675
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:02,650
people will know...

676
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,751
that even a god-king can fall.

677
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:07,354
Listen, Leo, I came here to talk.

678
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:09,763
Just listen to my deal.

679
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:13,830
Ladies!

680
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:16,338
Hi, Xerxes.

681
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:20,073
Ah, that's probably for me.

682
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,372
Hello?

683
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:24,038
Really?

684
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:26,082
Okay.

685
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,345
That was the banker.

686
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:29,613
He's offering...

687
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,712
to buy back your briefcase...

688
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,882
for a weekend getaway for two...

689
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,051
in Las Vegas, Nevada...

690
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:37,753
at the Palms Hotel and Casino!

691
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,386
Ooh...

692
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:40,725
I've always wanted to go there!

693
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:44,199
All you have to do
is bow down to me...

694
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,363
...and surrender Sparta.

695
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,033
Deal...

696
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:51,597
or no deal?

697
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,601
- Deal! -
Deal! - Take it!

698
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,940
Take the deal!

699
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,605
You think I should? No!

700
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,841
- Take the deal!
- It's simple.

701
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,144
- Take the deal!
- Come on!

702
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:01,616
What about Sparta?

703
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,709
- Hit the button!
- Come on!

704
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:04,754
Take the deal! Take it!

705
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:06,619
- Take it!
- Take the deal!

706
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,782
Hit the button!

707
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:10,489
Take it!

708
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:13,257
No deal!

709
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,764
Oh, great!

710
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:18,063
By the time I'm finished with you...

711
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:20,103
Sparta will be annihilated.

712
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,798
It will be as though
you never existed.

713
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,602
I will see to it that you are...

714
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:26,165
written out of the history books.

715
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:30,947
Well, that's fine by me, Xerxes...

716
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,483
because I can't read.

717
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:39,020
<i>Xerxes didn't take rejection well.</i>

718
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:42,183
<i>From every corner ofhis empire...</i>

719
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:45,422
<i>he sent his most
vicious warriors to fight.</i>

720
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:47,896
Yo mama's so ghetto,
when she breast-feeds...

721
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:49,933
Kool-Aid comes out!

722
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,601
Yo mama's so stupid,
she thought Tupac Shakur...

723
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,645
was a Jewish holiday!

724
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,512
Get her, Dilio!

725
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:14,024
Yo mama's so fat, her
pants size is, um, um, um...

726
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,854
"Bitch, lose some weight"!

727
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:18,956
Your mama's so butch...

728
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:21,054
Rosie O'Donnell
wouldn't even date her.

729
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:23,725
Uh-uh! No, you didn't!
No, you didn't!

730
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:25,132
- Whoa!
- No, you didn't!

731
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:28,228
Well, yo mama titties
is smaller than yours.

732
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,472
Bounce some D's on that bitch!

733
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:36,138
Your mama's so fat,
Sir Mix-A-lot decided...

734
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:37,908
he doesn't like big butts!

735
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:40,382
And he ain't lyin'!
Kiss that!

736
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:43,644
Oh! Ow!

737
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,188
Oh, my eyes!

738
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:47,416
Oh! Oh!

739
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:48,651
Walk it off.

740
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:50,023
- How you like that, huh?
- Sit down.

741
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:55,327
Yo, yo mama's so fat,
that when she farts...

742
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:57,959
Al Gore accuses her
of global warming, dawg.

743
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:59,195
Whew!

744
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,601
Cranking it up!

745
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:05,472
Yes, well, that may be the case,
but your mama's so hairy...

746
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:07,373
the only language she speaks...

747
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:09,071
is Wookiee!

748
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,410
Oh!

749
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,712
That's it!

750
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:16,116
Well, yo mama-

751
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:17,676
Yo ma-

752
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:22,016
Yes!

753
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,753
Bye-bye!

754
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,419
Back to the hood!

755
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,897
<i>Xerxes watched
as his warriors were defeated.</i>

756
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:32,629
<i>It sent an all-too-human chill
up his spine.</i>

757
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:35,638
<i>Or perhaps that was
the Dentyne Ice...</i>

758
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:37,401
<i>with cool mint crystals.</i>

759
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:48,779
Loyalist said you wanted to see me.

760
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:52,283
That's my urine sample.

761
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:55,989
Tastes like asparagus.

762
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,823
Leonidas needs more troops.

763
00:44:57,895 --> 00:45:02,559
Without reinforcements,
Sparta will fall and-

764
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:13,471
I'll do anything...

765
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:16,104
For my husband.

766
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,841
Anything?

767
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:23,844
Awesome!

768
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:25,479
I'm so getting laid!

769
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:28,024
Good-bye, virginity.

770
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:30,356
I promise you,
you're not going to enjoy this.

771
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:33,089
But I suffer from premature eja-

772
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:37,128
Oh-

773
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:38,361
Mmm.

774
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,869
It's okay; I have crabs.

775
00:45:47,904 --> 00:45:49,963
Ooh-

776
00:46:09,598 --> 00:46:12,863
Betray your beloved Spartans-

777
00:46:16,705 --> 00:46:18,639
Nice.

778
00:46:20,075 --> 00:46:23,511
And I will give you
anything you desire.

779
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:25,103
That's hot.

780
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,977
Bow down to me.

781
00:46:29,184 --> 00:46:31,448
Bow down to the great god-king...

782
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,181
Xerxes.

783
00:46:33,255 --> 00:46:34,847
I'm a Hilton.

784
00:46:34,923 --> 00:46:36,447
I don't bow.

785
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,259
But I do bend over.

786
00:46:39,328 --> 00:46:41,455
Ah, good.

787
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:44,363
There's a secret goat path
into the Hot Gates.

788
00:46:44,433 --> 00:46:47,664
You could totally use it
to defeat Leonidas.

789
00:46:47,736 --> 00:46:50,762
Ah-

790
00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:53,103
And what do you desire?

791
00:46:53,175 --> 00:46:55,336
I want my record expunged.

792
00:46:56,378 --> 00:46:58,175
Oh, and I want
that new Chanel purse.

793
00:46:59,848 --> 00:47:01,008
Thank you.

794
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:03,813
I want throwing up to be fun.

795
00:47:03,886 --> 00:47:06,480
You got something to say,
say it- I got things to do.

796
00:47:06,555 --> 00:47:08,614
What was it?

797
00:47:08,691 --> 00:47:09,988
I can't remem-

798
00:47:10,059 --> 00:47:11,788
Oh, God, geez, yeah.

799
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,657
I want to get this hump removed.

800
00:47:21,103 --> 00:47:22,365
Mmm!

801
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:31,604
Will you please just do it? It's really
heavy and really hard to keep clean.

802
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,875
Done.

803
00:47:35,017 --> 00:47:37,611
Aah!

804
00:47:49,264 --> 00:47:51,198
As long as Xerxes doesn't find...

805
00:47:51,266 --> 00:47:53,564
the secret path to the Hot Gates...

806
00:47:54,937 --> 00:47:57,735
...their vast numbers
won't count for shit.

807
00:47:59,341 --> 00:48:00,774
My king!

808
00:48:02,911 --> 00:48:04,845
Catch your breath.

809
00:48:04,913 --> 00:48:06,744
Vanilla blended.

810
00:48:06,815 --> 00:48:09,113
What is it, boy?

811
00:48:11,553 --> 00:48:14,021
Xerxes has found
the secret goat path...

812
00:48:14,089 --> 00:48:15,181
through the Hot Gates.

813
00:48:15,257 --> 00:48:16,281
Aw, shit!

814
00:48:16,358 --> 00:48:18,656
Damn that Paris Hilton.

815
00:48:18,727 --> 00:48:20,592
I hate her.

816
00:48:20,662 --> 00:48:22,152
He's deployed thousands
of Persian soldiers...

817
00:48:22,231 --> 00:48:23,493
that'll be here any minute.

818
00:48:28,937 --> 00:48:32,771
Dilio...

819
00:48:32,841 --> 00:48:34,331
how bad are your injuries?

820
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:37,641
Oh, it's, uh- it's
just a scratch, my king.

821
00:48:42,151 --> 00:48:43,482
You've got no eyes.

822
00:48:43,552 --> 00:48:45,952
The gods blessed me with a spare.

823
00:48:46,021 --> 00:48:47,613
No, they haven't.

824
00:48:47,689 --> 00:48:49,418
You just had the two.

825
00:48:49,491 --> 00:48:51,425
Jeremy has the spare.

826
00:48:56,198 --> 00:48:58,723
I can still fight!

827
00:49:00,536 --> 00:49:01,468
Whoa! No!

828
00:49:01,537 --> 00:49:03,061
Dilio! Dilio!

829
00:49:03,138 --> 00:49:07,165
Di- Dilio! Dilio! Dilio.

830
00:49:07,242 --> 00:49:08,641
Walk with me.

831
00:49:10,312 --> 00:49:12,303
No. No. No.

832
00:49:15,551 --> 00:49:18,384
Your fate is the most important.

833
00:49:18,454 --> 00:49:23,585
You must go back to Sparta...

834
00:49:23,659 --> 00:49:25,092
and tell of our tale.

835
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,321
Yes, my king.

836
00:49:27,396 --> 00:49:29,626
Any message for the queen?

837
00:49:42,444 --> 00:49:44,503
None that need be said.

838
00:49:45,914 --> 00:49:47,677
Now go, Dilio.

839
00:49:47,749 --> 00:49:50,946
Tell how 13 Spartans
fought for honor...

840
00:49:51,019 --> 00:49:54,011
for glory...
for freedom!

841
00:49:55,457 --> 00:49:58,017
Good luck, Dilio.

842
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:17,670
Spartans!

843
00:50:24,953 --> 00:50:26,545
This is your final chance.

844
00:50:26,622 --> 00:50:29,716
Bow down to me or you will die.

845
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:33,124
I bow for no man!

846
00:50:37,633 --> 00:50:39,863
Take a knee.

847
00:50:39,935 --> 00:50:41,061
No!

848
00:50:41,136 --> 00:50:43,730
- Curtsey.
- Enough!

849
00:50:46,408 --> 00:50:48,069
Well, your sandal is untied.

850
00:50:48,143 --> 00:50:50,703
Oh... thanks very much.

851
00:50:50,779 --> 00:50:52,371
See?
Was that that difficult?

852
00:50:52,447 --> 00:50:54,347
- No, wait, no!
- Ah-tah-tah-tah-tah-

853
00:50:54,416 --> 00:50:56,748
- No, I wasn't bowing.
- No, no, no.

854
00:50:56,818 --> 00:50:58,012
I was just doing my shoe!

855
00:50:58,086 --> 00:51:00,418
No, you acknowledged me
as your god-king.

856
00:51:00,489 --> 00:51:01,353
High-five!

857
00:51:01,423 --> 00:51:04,756
Ooh.

858
00:51:04,826 --> 00:51:06,259
What?

859
00:51:08,764 --> 00:51:10,595
What-What-What the hell is so funny?

860
00:51:10,666 --> 00:51:12,429
- You!
- Me?

861
00:51:12,501 --> 00:51:14,196
You greet like women.

862
00:51:14,269 --> 00:51:16,294
You idiots are
wearing banana hammocks...

863
00:51:16,371 --> 00:51:17,497
and you're laughing at me?

864
00:51:17,573 --> 00:51:19,063
Now you're pissing me off.

865
00:51:19,141 --> 00:51:20,369
I'm getting everybody.

866
00:51:20,442 --> 00:51:23,138
Hello. Where you at?

867
00:51:23,211 --> 00:51:24,439
I know where I'm at.

868
00:51:24,513 --> 00:51:26,276
Bring in my vast army.

869
00:51:26,348 --> 00:51:27,440
You 13...

870
00:51:27,516 --> 00:51:29,040
putz are no match...

871
00:51:29,117 --> 00:51:30,709
for my massive Persian army.

872
00:51:30,786 --> 00:51:32,515
They number in the millions!

873
00:51:37,726 --> 00:51:39,626
That's just a blue screen.

874
00:51:39,695 --> 00:51:41,094
Stupid.

875
00:51:41,163 --> 00:51:43,097
It's a visual effect.

876
00:51:43,165 --> 00:51:45,030
It's going to be digitally
inserted later.

877
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:48,035
And the army is quite
impressive, as you can imagine.

878
00:51:54,743 --> 00:51:56,404
Gentlemen, may I present...

879
00:51:56,478 --> 00:51:58,844
Queen Margo.

880
00:52:24,439 --> 00:52:26,498
Come on, baby.
I'm gettin' a chubby.

881
00:52:28,744 --> 00:52:31,542
Boner alert. Boner alert.

882
00:52:31,613 --> 00:52:33,478
Okay, boys, make it rain!

883
00:52:33,548 --> 00:52:35,516
# Do the D-A-N-C-E,
1-2-3-4 fight #

884
00:52:35,584 --> 00:52:40,283
# Stick to the B-E-A-T,
get ready to ignite #

885
00:52:40,355 --> 00:52:43,813
#You were such a P-Y-T,
catching all the light #

886
00:52:43,892 --> 00:52:47,384
#Just easy as A-B-C, that's how
you make it right... #

887
00:52:52,034 --> 00:52:54,730
Good councilmen...

888
00:52:54,803 --> 00:52:56,236
I implore you.

889
00:52:56,304 --> 00:53:01,332
Your king, my dear
husband, needs your help.

890
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:03,139
Sparta will fall...

891
00:53:03,211 --> 00:53:06,510
if you don't agree
to send the rest of our army.

892
00:53:19,194 --> 00:53:21,162
Gentlemen, our only
hope for survival...

893
00:53:21,229 --> 00:53:23,959
is to surrender to Xerxes
and beg for his forgiveness.

894
00:53:24,032 --> 00:53:28,230
Do not be swayed by the words
of this common prick-tease...

895
00:53:28,303 --> 00:53:30,396
with crabs all up in her coochie.

896
00:53:30,472 --> 00:53:32,633
Ooh-

897
00:53:32,708 --> 00:53:34,903
Oh, no, you didn't.

898
00:53:34,976 --> 00:53:37,035
Yes. Yes, I did.

899
00:53:42,317 --> 00:53:46,083
<i>Queen Margo unleashed
a venomous rage...</i>

900
00:53:47,989 --> 00:53:52,153
<i>...much like Tobey Maguire
in Spider-Man 3.</i>

901
00:54:01,703 --> 00:54:03,068
I'm evil.

902
00:54:08,844 --> 00:54:09,868
Made of sand.

903
00:54:20,088 --> 00:54:21,646
Ohh!

904
00:54:26,495 --> 00:54:27,359
Oh, no.

905
00:54:29,364 --> 00:54:30,695
Ooh!

906
00:54:36,571 --> 00:54:38,266
Oh... cute.

907
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,706
Gross.

908
00:54:51,753 --> 00:54:53,812
What is it?

909
00:54:53,889 --> 00:54:55,015
Oh! Oh!

910
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:58,025
Oh, God!
Oh! Oh, my God.

911
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:03,491
How you like me now, Sandman?

912
00:55:03,565 --> 00:55:05,157
Oh, no.

913
00:55:07,369 --> 00:55:09,530
Dust-busting bitch! No!

914
00:55:13,642 --> 00:55:16,543
No!

915
00:55:25,921 --> 00:55:27,684
Ah-

916
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:33,857
Well, tickle my nipples
with a feather.

917
00:55:33,929 --> 00:55:36,523
Xerxes is in Traitoro's top five.

918
00:55:36,598 --> 00:55:38,589
Grumble, grumble, grumble-

919
00:55:38,667 --> 00:55:41,101
Traitoro was a... traitor?

920
00:55:41,169 --> 00:55:43,000
Duh!

921
00:55:43,939 --> 00:55:44,997
All in favor...

922
00:55:45,073 --> 00:55:47,541
of sending more troops...
say aye.

923
00:55:47,609 --> 00:55:52,342
Aye! Aye! Aye!
Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye-

924
00:56:15,437 --> 00:56:16,734
Spartans!

925
00:56:20,008 --> 00:56:21,441
We have you surrounded.

926
00:56:21,509 --> 00:56:23,636
Lay down your weapons!

927
00:56:23,712 --> 00:56:25,543
Come and get them!

928
00:56:25,614 --> 00:56:27,275
Formation!

929
00:56:33,755 --> 00:56:34,915
Um-

930
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:38,426
A Spartan always protects
another man's rear.

931
00:56:43,498 --> 00:56:45,227
Adjust your sword, boy.

932
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:46,824
It's digging into my back.

933
00:56:49,671 --> 00:56:51,002
But I'm not wearing my sword.

934
00:56:53,808 --> 00:56:55,002
Carry on then.

935
00:56:55,076 --> 00:56:56,907
My son.

936
00:56:56,978 --> 00:57:01,745
Today...
you are truly a Spartan.

937
00:57:01,816 --> 00:57:02,805
Thanks, Father.

938
00:57:05,186 --> 00:57:06,153
Attack!

939
00:57:09,524 --> 00:57:11,685
Steady, Spartans!

940
00:57:21,937 --> 00:57:24,098
Remember this day, boys!

941
00:57:24,172 --> 00:57:27,369
For today is the day you die!

942
00:57:27,442 --> 00:57:30,002
- Huh?
- What? Huh?

943
00:57:30,078 --> 00:57:30,830
What?

944
00:57:30,845 --> 00:57:32,836
L- I mean they die.

945
00:57:32,914 --> 00:57:35,712
Today's the day they die-
that's what I meant to say.

946
00:57:38,687 --> 00:57:39,779
Go!

947
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:56,469
Oh, what a bunch of dumb shits.

948
00:57:59,474 --> 00:58:00,998
God, that smarts.

949
00:58:01,076 --> 00:58:03,909
I am gonna go Hercules on your ass!

950
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:33,997
Ghost Rider!

951
00:59:37,372 --> 00:59:39,932
You're going to hell.

952
00:59:50,251 --> 00:59:53,853
Stop, drop and roll!

953
01:00:07,135 --> 01:00:09,467
Yo!

954
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,479
No!

955
01:00:21,449 --> 01:00:23,542
Yo, Sonio.

956
01:00:25,286 --> 01:00:27,049
I'm gonna knock your block off.

957
01:00:27,122 --> 01:00:28,953
Oh, shit.

958
01:00:30,125 --> 01:00:31,990
Sonio!

959
01:00:43,905 --> 01:00:47,534
You'll pay for this, Balboa.

960
01:00:47,609 --> 01:00:48,576
Go for it.

961
01:00:54,082 --> 01:00:55,982
Adult diapers?

962
01:01:22,744 --> 01:01:28,774
Botox... overdose.

963
01:01:35,857 --> 01:01:38,189
Yes!

964
01:01:39,327 --> 01:01:41,227
Yeah!

965
01:01:44,299 --> 01:01:45,425
Yeah!

966
01:01:49,938 --> 01:01:51,701
Yes!

967
01:01:55,843 --> 01:01:58,107
Xerxes!

968
01:02:07,956 --> 01:02:11,756
It's a- a beautiful death.

969
01:02:14,329 --> 01:02:16,229
It's actually not that attractive.

970
01:02:41,189 --> 01:02:43,350
# I'm a Barbie girl #

971
01:02:43,424 --> 01:02:45,756
# In the Barbie world #

972
01:02:45,827 --> 01:02:48,125
# Life in plastic,
it's fantastic #

973
01:02:48,196 --> 01:02:50,664
# Come on, Barbie, let's go party! #

974
01:02:50,732 --> 01:02:52,359
#Ah-ah-ah-yeah #

975
01:02:52,433 --> 01:02:53,991
# Come on, Barbie,
let's go party #

976
01:03:18,626 --> 01:03:19,957
Shit!

977
01:03:27,435 --> 01:03:30,700
Enough of this gratuitous
video game violence!

978
01:03:50,958 --> 01:03:53,586
Waah!

979
01:03:57,799 --> 01:03:59,096
Ah-

980
01:03:59,167 --> 01:04:01,158
Aha!

981
01:04:01,235 --> 01:04:02,862
A Transformer cube!

982
01:04:11,946 --> 01:04:14,847
Okay, baby, let's transform.

983
01:04:48,783 --> 01:04:51,718
I... am Xerxestron...

984
01:04:51,786 --> 01:04:55,813
equipped with advanced
alien technology.

985
01:04:59,394 --> 01:05:02,557
Leave Britney alone!

986
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:04,393
He is a god-king.

987
01:05:04,465 --> 01:05:06,558
Please-

988
01:05:13,141 --> 01:05:16,133
Leave her alone!

989
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:18,269
She's a human!

990
01:05:18,346 --> 01:05:20,746
Oh, oh, ain't that a bitch.

991
01:05:28,623 --> 01:05:31,387
<i>Leonidas was true to his word.</i>

992

<i>A god-king did fall.</i>

993
01:05:33,828 --> 01:05:36,888
<i>But unfortunately, right on them.</i>

994
01:05:57,218 --> 01:05:59,015
I- I- I just-

995
01:06:01,522 --> 01:06:03,649
Oh-

996
01:06:05,026 --> 01:06:06,687
Ooh.

997
01:06:06,761 --> 01:06:08,285
Queen Margo.

998
01:06:08,362 --> 01:06:09,829
- Yeah.
- Oh.

999
01:06:33,654 --> 01:06:36,054
<i>Leonidas and the Spartans...</i>

But we now have 100,000 soldiers!

1005
01:07:00,481 --> 01:07:02,506
Ah-ooh! Ah-ooh! Ah-ooh!

1006

1007
01:07:13,961 --> 01:07:15,292
Ah.

1008
01:07:15,363 --> 01:07:17,797
Follow me, boys.

1009
01:07:17,865 --> 01:07:20,425
I don't know.

# I was petrified #

1016

01:07:57,672 --> 01:07:59,663
#Thinking how
you did me wrong #

1019
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:01,332

1020

Ow!

1160
01:14:02,102 --> 01:14:04,536
He can outflank us now, my king.

1161
01:14:08,309 --> 01:14:09,640
Men!

1162
01:14:14,048 --> 01:14:16,539
We are facing certain death.

Cherries.

1164
01:14:18,752 --> 01:14:20,617
But...

1165
01:14:20,688 --> 01:14:23,452
the joke's on them,
because they don't know...

1166
01:14:23,524 --> 01:14:26,823
that dying in battle
is the greatest honor...

1167
01:14:26,894 --> 01:14:28,953
for any Spartan!

1168
01:14:31,532 --> 01:14:34,023
Ah-hoo.

1169
01:14:34,101 --> 01:14:37,502
God, that's a shitty plan.

1170
01:14:37,571 --> 01:14:39,869
Look, Leonidas...

1171
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:41,805
war is not the answer.
Heh-heh.

1172
01:14:42,476 --> 01:14:44,376
Trust me, I know.

1173
01:14:44,445 --> 01:14:47,005
No! War is the answer!

1174
01:14:58,325 --> 01:15:00,054
Where am I?

1175
01:15:03,497 --> 01:15:06,523
Spidey, you're fired.

1176
01:15:17,611 --> 01:15:19,738
ELLEN DeGENERES: Hi.
How are you, Leonidas?

1177
01:15:19,813 --> 01:15:21,075
Ellen.

1178
01:15:21,148 --> 01:15:22,638
Listen, I don't know
why you're so upset.

1179
01:15:22,716 --> 01:15:24,445
You look great.
You know, the cape is great.

1180
01:15:24,518 --> 01:15:25,610
Love the... diaper.

1181
01:15:25,686 --> 01:15:26,812
I- I'd wear something very similar...

1182
01:15:26,887 --> 01:15:28,047
for Portia on Friday nights.

1183
01:15:28,122 --> 01:15:29,282
We get frisky.

1184
01:15:29,356 --> 01:15:31,347
Hello, Leonidas.

1185
01:15:31,425 --> 01:15:34,053
Wow, is it hot in here?

1186
01:15:34,128 --> 01:15:37,256
Okay, Portia, Portia,
women, women, women.

1187
01:15:37,331 --> 01:15:39,060
Women, you like
women.

1188
01:15:39,133 --> 01:15:40,259
I can see by your-

1189
01:15:40,334 --> 01:15:41,892
your reaction, you're not amused.

1190
01:15:41,969 --> 01:15:44,961
<i>It's the same reaction anyone
who went to see Mr. Wrong had.</i>

1191
01:15:45,039 --> 01:15:47,405
Uh, let's play a game-
maybe we could play a game.

1192
01:15:47,474 --> 01:15:48,634
How about "Who Sneezed?"

1193
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:49,733
It's a real easy game.

1194
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:51,243
We close our eyes
and someone sneezes...

1195
01:15:51,311 --> 01:15:52,744
and you guess who.

1196
01:15:52,813 --> 01:15:54,940
If it was you, you win- 'cause
obviously, you know.

1197
01:15:55,015 --> 01:15:56,039
Listen, chill out.

1198
01:15:56,116 --> 01:15:57,777
Let's just dance, shall we? Come on.

1199
01:15:57,851 --> 01:16:00,342
That's right. Oh, boy.

1200
01:16:00,421 --> 01:16:01,718
Okay.

1201
01:16:01,789 --> 01:16:03,120
There you go, you're
getting the hang of it.

1202
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:05,750
- You know, back and forth-
- No, I can't do this!

1203
01:16:07,227 --> 01:16:08,717
Yo mama's so ugly, if she was...

1204
01:16:08,796 --> 01:16:10,593
on the Spice Girls,
her name would be...

1205
01:16:10,664 --> 01:16:12,996
Dookie Spice!

1206
01:16:13,067 --> 01:16:14,728
Doo-doo!

1207

Leonidas.

1208
01:16:18,505 --> 01:16:20,598
You should try Scientology.

1209
01:16:20,674 --> 01:16:22,505
I'm gonna set Katie free.

1210
01:16:24,178 --> 01:16:25,167
Yes!

1211
01:16:25,245 --> 01:16:26,974
I had to buy
a million and one glitters...

1212
01:16:27,047 --> 01:16:28,776
with my own money,
and I had to buy-

1213
01:16:28,849 --> 01:16:31,317
I put them on by hand, Simon...

1214
01:16:31,385 --> 01:16:35,253
and my reputation is all I have,
and for you to sit here...

I'm not intennigent-

1216
01:16:38,025 --> 01:16:39,788
inte-
that I'm not intenni-

1217
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:41,418
- Let me start over.
- Intelligent. Yeah.

1218
01:16:41,495 --> 01:16:42,655
- Hang on.
- Intelligent. Yeah.

1219
01:16:42,729 --> 01:16:44,594
I looked everywhere.

1220
01:16:44,665 --> 01:16:46,724
Don't you hate when you're
on an airplane, you know...

1221
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,893
and the captain's, like,
"If you look out the window...

1222
01:16:48,969 --> 01:16:50,766
to your left, you're gonna
see another plane"?

1223
01:16:50,838 --> 01:16:52,703
Am I right? See what
I'm talking about?

1224
01:16:52,773 --> 01:16:54,104
Another plane? Right?

1225
01:16:54,174 --> 01:16:55,664
Don't you hate when you're
in the supermarket...

1226
01:16:55,742 --> 01:16:57,107
you know, and you're in aisle three.

1227
01:16:57,177 --> 01:16:58,474
And, like, "Clean up
on aisle three. "

1228
01:16:58,545 --> 01:17:00,035
You know? And you're, like,
"What am I doing here?"

1229
01:17:00,114 --> 01:17:01,513
I'm in aisle three, huh? Right?

1230
01:17:01,582 --> 01:17:04,016
You're all my fans, right?
You all love me, right?

1231

1232
01:17:05,619 --> 01:17:07,018
Okay, that's cool.

01:17:07,087 --> 01:17:08,315

Sorry, I didn't hear
what you said...

1242
01:17:27,141 --> 01:17:28,438
Because
I can't understand you...

1243
01:17:28,509 --> 01:17:30,204
