1
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,436
Good morning.

2
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:42,574
Watch your back.

3
00:02:42,642 --> 00:02:44,743
All right. I see it.

4
00:02:51,284 --> 00:02:52,385
Ma'am.

5
00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:02,228
This for the living room?

6
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:03,362
Yeah.

7
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:12,004
This is one of the nicest houses

8
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:14,240
we've ever moved anyone like you into.

9
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:16,742
It's got gas heat, air conditioned,

10
00:03:16,809 --> 00:03:18,577
harvest gold fixtures in the kitchen.

11
00:03:18,645 --> 00:03:20,746
If you like that kind of thing.

12
00:03:20,813 --> 00:03:22,448
Some of the ladies do.

13
00:03:22,516 --> 00:03:24,083
Hey, Linda, what do you think?

14
00:03:24,151 --> 00:03:25,584
I always promised you

15
00:03:25,652 --> 00:03:27,319
a nice house somewhere in America.

16
00:03:27,387 --> 00:03:29,522
Let's not get carried away, OK, Vinnie?

17
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:32,091
It's gonna be a lot easier if you start

18
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,093
calling each other Terry and Todd .

19
00:03:34,161 --> 00:03:36,662
It's a nice house, Terry. okay?

20
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:38,531
No, you're Terry and he's Todd .

21
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:39,798
Wait for me!

22
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:41,500
Let's take a look inside.

23
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:42,634
Come on.

24
00:03:45,072 --> 00:03:46,105
Thanks.

25
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:47,606
I'll need your social security number

26
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:49,542
So I can process your payment.

27
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:50,576
My what?

28
00:03:50,643 --> 00:03:51,810
Your social security number

29
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:53,645
so we can pay you.

30
00:03:58,017 --> 00:03:59,218
2.

31
00:03:59,286 --> 00:04:00,986
2.

32
00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:02,321
1.

33
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:03,422
1.

34
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,423
5.

35
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:06,358
5-dash.

36
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:08,394
6.

37
00:04:08,462 --> 00:04:10,062
6.

38
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,363
9.

39
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:13,265
9-dash.

40
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,900
- 8. 
- 8.

41
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:16,502
- 2. 
- 2.

42
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,637
- 1. 
- 1.

43
00:04:18,705 --> 00:04:21,607
2, 5.

44
00:04:21,674 --> 00:04:22,608
2...

45
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:24,843
That's one too many numbers.

46
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:27,846
Take off the 5.

47
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:32,751
If you have any problems at all,

48
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:34,153
call my office in San Diego.

49
00:04:34,221 --> 00:04:35,654
They always know where I am.

50
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:37,089
Truth is, I'm usually there.

51
00:04:37,157 --> 00:04:38,657
We'll let you know as soon as <i>we</i> know

52
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:40,359
when we're going to New York to testify.

53
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:42,661
Great. Great.

54
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:44,163
Thanks for everything.

55
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:46,165
You'll like it here. It's a nice community.

56
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:48,534
I'd live here myself if my wife didn't...

57
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:50,035
Didn't hate it, right?

58
00:04:50,103 --> 00:04:51,537
No, no, no.

59
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:54,006
Take my word. She'd hate it.

60
00:04:54,073 --> 00:04:56,041
She has to be near town

61
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:58,010
because she works with athletes.

62
00:04:58,077 --> 00:04:59,845
If you ever want baseball tickets,

63
00:04:59,912 --> 00:05:01,147
give me a call.

64
00:05:01,214 --> 00:05:02,548
Great. Baseball.

65
00:05:02,616 --> 00:05:05,050
The Padres play the Mets every so often.

66
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:07,186
Though you folk are probably Yankee fans.

67
00:05:07,254 --> 00:05:09,188
Most organized crime people are.

68
00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:11,123
I love the Yankees.

69
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:12,625
Linda loves the Yankees.

70
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:14,059
So does Terry.

71
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:15,060
Who's Terry?

72
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:16,061
You are.

73
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:18,264
If you have questions, give me a call.

74
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:21,367
Thanks. I really appreciate it.

75
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:24,203
This is my job. I get paid.

76
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:26,205
You don't tip FBI men.

77
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:29,208
Sure, you do.

78
00:05:30,277 --> 00:05:32,211
Yo, Frankie.

79
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,212
Oh.

80
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,215
You think this guy's for--hey!

81
00:05:36,283 --> 00:05:39,485
There's a 4:00 nonstop out of here.

82
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:44,923
You really going back to New York?

83
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:45,924
You'll find another wife.

84
00:05:45,992 --> 00:05:46,925
I know.

85
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:48,727
I could've pulled out months ago.

86
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:50,729
You wouldn't have gotten the big house

87
00:05:50,797 --> 00:05:52,097
Or the extra allowance for the spouse.

88
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:53,599
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

89
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,234
Next time I see you,

90
00:05:55,302 --> 00:05:56,735
you'll be eating white bread.

91
00:05:56,803 --> 00:05:58,237
You'll probably even like it.

92
00:05:58,305 --> 00:06:00,272
It's not bad with egg salad.

93
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,107
It's better than the slammer.

94
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:04,042
Keep telling yourself that, sweetheart.

95
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,878
You might believe it after a while.

96
00:06:06,946 --> 00:06:09,248
And stay out of my purse while I'm on the phone.

97
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:12,284
I wasn't in your purse.

98
00:06:12,352 --> 00:06:13,285
Yes, you were!

99
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:14,820
You're always accusing me.

100
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:18,156
Put the Visa card back in my purse, Vinnie.

101
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:24,029
I'd like a cab at--

102
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:26,332
What the frig is the address here?

103
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,668
How should I know? Number 1 Happy Street.

104
00:06:39,212 --> 00:06:41,580
You know what the guy tried to do?

105
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:44,149
No idea. I haven't met a criminal in years.

106
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:46,885
He tried to tip me. Can you believe that?

107
00:06:46,953 --> 00:06:48,187
How much?

108
00:06:48,254 --> 00:06:49,888
100 bucks.

109
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:50,889
100 bucks?

110
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:52,391
That's not the point.

111
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:53,892
The point is the man proffered a gratuity.

112
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,294
It's against protocol. I can't accept that.

113
00:06:55,361 --> 00:06:56,795
No, I know you can't.

114
00:06:56,862 --> 00:06:58,330
Not to mention it was insulting.

115
00:06:58,398 --> 00:06:59,798
Task completed, Coopersmith?

116
00:06:59,865 --> 00:07:01,300
Yes, sir.

117
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,302
This isn't going to take a lot of my time.

118
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:05,304
This guy's living in the middle of nowhere.

119
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:07,339
Is there anything else I could take on

120
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:09,141
in addition to my regular duties, sir.

121
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:10,309
Coopersmith,

122
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:11,977
This is an extremely important government witness.

123
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:14,813
When you've delivered him to his 2 court appearances,

124
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,315
then we'll talk about something else.

125
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:17,949
Not before.

126
00:07:19,051 --> 00:07:20,986
Very good, sir.

127
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:25,324
Back to the dangerous world

128
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:26,825
of FHA fraud.

129
00:07:26,892 --> 00:07:30,329
I don't want to fill out any more forms.

130
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:32,331
I want to go undercover.

131
00:07:32,398 --> 00:07:34,333
I want to stake out some son of a bitch

132
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,335
in a farmhouse in the middle of nowhere

133
00:07:36,402 --> 00:07:38,170
and eat a lot of takeout food.

134
00:07:38,238 --> 00:07:39,671
I want to wear a windbreaker.

135
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:41,340
Once, when I was undercover,

136
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:43,842
I got to drive a BMW.

137
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:46,345
I know.

138
00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:47,846
I can't help it.

139
00:07:47,913 --> 00:07:49,848
It was the high point of my life.

140
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:55,987
I'm getting back into undercover work.

141
00:07:56,055 --> 00:07:58,490
Forget it, Kirby. It's against regulations.

142
00:07:58,558 --> 00:07:59,491
There's overtime involved.

143
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:02,494
You can't catch criminals in the FBI

144
00:08:02,562 --> 00:08:03,862
If there's overtime involved.

145
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:05,364
Something could change.

146
00:08:05,431 --> 00:08:06,365
Things change.

147
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:07,533
Yeah. Right.

148
00:08:09,735 --> 00:08:12,638
This is San Diego all sports radio.

149
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:14,373
We're talking about last night's game.

150
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,642
Another heartbreaking loss by the home team.

151
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,977
The Pads, way ahead, lost in the ninth

152
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:21,980
when Wally Bunting walked in the winning run.

153
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:24,749
Fans, what are we going to do about Wally unting?

154
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:38,830
Barney.

155
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:42,284
Wally. Too bad.

156
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:44,386
Could've happened to anybody, right?

157
00:08:44,454 --> 00:08:46,504
Yeah. I guess so.

158
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:47,806
Relief pitching.

159
00:08:47,874 --> 00:08:49,241
It's a high-risk occupation.

160
00:08:49,308 --> 00:08:51,409
Anybody could blow a 7-run lead.

161
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:52,444
8.

162
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:54,179
Whatever.

163
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:56,414
They're sending me down.

164
00:08:56,482 --> 00:08:57,415
To the minors?

165
00:08:57,483 --> 00:08:58,416
To Wichita.

166
00:08:58,484 --> 00:08:59,918
I'm sorry, Wally.

167
00:08:59,985 --> 00:09:01,420
I'm gonna miss you.

168
00:09:01,487 --> 00:09:03,555
Margaret will miss you, too. I'm sure.

169
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:05,424
I mean, therapists aren't supposed to say

170
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:07,259
that they'll miss their patients,

171
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,560
so how do I know?

172
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:10,429
Boy, this is the second relief pitcher

173
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:12,397
she's lost to the minors this season.

174
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:16,435
I'm going too, Barney.

175
00:09:16,502 --> 00:09:18,670
Where?

176
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:20,038
To Wichita.

177
00:09:20,106 --> 00:09:22,173
Why on earth would you go to Wichita?

178
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,514
How old are you?

179
00:09:29,582 --> 00:09:30,749
26.

180
00:09:32,418 --> 00:09:33,852
Look, I'm sorry, Barney,

181
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,554
But it's just no fun here.

182
00:09:35,622 --> 00:09:37,055
<i>You're</i> no fun.

183
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:38,657
What do you mean I'm no fun?

184
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:40,459
You get the oil changed on the second Tuesday,

185
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:42,461
you get the car washed on the fourth Thursday.

186
00:09:42,528 --> 00:09:45,063
You get your hair cut on the 11th of the month.

187
00:09:45,131 --> 00:09:47,466
You never ever get a different cut.

188
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:48,967
Look at how you eat pancakes.

189
00:09:49,034 --> 00:09:50,969
What's wrong with the way I eat pancakes?

190
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:52,571
How does he eat pancakes?

191
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,473
He has a system for eating pancakes.

192
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,974
So the bottom pancake

193
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,976
gets as much syrup as the top one.

194
00:09:58,043 --> 00:10:00,078
He has a system for everything.

195
00:10:00,146 --> 00:10:01,613
Wally.

196
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:13,992
An error cost the Padres the game.

197
00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:16,094
The losing streak now stands at 4 in a row.

198
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:18,664
KBAJ now ends its broadcast day.

199
00:10:18,731 --> 00:10:22,601
The score again-- L.A. 5, San Diego 3.

200
00:11:24,664 --> 00:11:25,731
Thank you very much.

201
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:27,032
You're welcome.

202
00:11:30,503 --> 00:11:32,370
Have a nice day.

203
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,874
Good morning, sir.

204
00:11:35,942 --> 00:11:37,910
Would you like to try a vanilla bran oat crunchie?

205
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:39,411
What do you think?

206
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:44,449
Have a nice day.

207
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:45,817
Fuck you!

208
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:00,792
That'll be $12.36.

209
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:06,798
Wow! A hundred.

210
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:14,172
Excuse me, sir.

211
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,674
I hope you had

212
00:13:15,742 --> 00:13:17,509
a very pleasant shopping experience.

213
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:20,311
Yeah.

214
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:21,312
Good!

215
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,181
Here's a form for our suggestion box.

216
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:24,683
If there's anything you want

217
00:13:24,751 --> 00:13:26,184
that we don't have,

218
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:27,819
you just let us know.

219
00:13:28,755 --> 00:13:30,188
Arugula.

220
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:32,658
I haven't had arugula in 6 weeks.

221
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:33,659
What's that?

222
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:36,628
It's a vegetable.

223
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:44,202
Car 274 to headquarters.

224
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,204
Car 274 to headquarters.

225
00:13:46,271 --> 00:13:50,942
Male subject apprehended driving stolen green Chrysler.

226
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:53,711
Hey, Hannah,

227
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:55,546
Got a grand theft auto just waiting for you.

228
00:13:55,614 --> 00:13:57,048
Let me at him.

229
00:13:57,116 --> 00:13:58,716
And let me know when you're done with him,

230
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:00,218
because I could use him.

231
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:02,220
He makes the hairs on the back my neck stand up.

232
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:03,921
The hairs on the back of your neck?

233
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,922
Yes.

234
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:07,425
That has never happened to me.

235
00:14:07,493 --> 00:14:09,927
I've never been interested in anyone on any level

236
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:11,429
unless I know...

237
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:13,064
if he's a college graduate.

238
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:14,199
Yes.

239
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:17,202
OK, that probably seems quite comical to you.

240
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:18,970
It's your life. Suit yourself.

241
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:20,472
I did...

242
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:22,440
and look where it got me.

243
00:14:35,187 --> 00:14:38,990
Todd Wilkinson, I'm Hannah Stubbs.

244
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:41,159
I'm the assistant district attorney.

245
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:43,228
How you two girls doing?

246
00:14:43,295 --> 00:14:44,262
What robbery?

247
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,031
I borrowed a guy's car.

248
00:14:46,098 --> 00:14:49,534
He gave you the keys. Is that correct?

249
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:52,370
He was supposed to leave them in the car.

250
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:53,371
But he didn't.

251
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,273
Right. If he'd left them,

252
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:57,642
I wouldn't have had to jump start it.

253
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:00,578
How do you happen to know how to jump start a car?

254
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:02,680
I learned it in the army.

255
00:15:02,748 --> 00:15:05,316
I was in the motor pool,

256
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:07,419
and everyone was always losing their keys.

257
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:10,221
The entire United States army wouldn't have moved

258
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:12,190
had it not been for me jump starting it.

259
00:15:12,258 --> 00:15:15,493
And it came in handy on several occasions--

260
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:20,365
jump starting ambulances in order to get invalids

261
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:23,034
to the dialysis machines.

262
00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:33,211
What was the name of, um...

263
00:15:34,713 --> 00:15:36,013
what was his name?

264
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:37,715
Eddie.

265
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:38,783
Eddie what?

266
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,419
That's all I know. He drives a blue Nova.

267
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:43,654
You weren't picked up in a blue Nova.

268
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:45,022
It was a green Chrysler.

269
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:48,326
Oh. Well, that explains it.

270
00:15:48,394 --> 00:15:51,129
I jump started the wrong car.

271
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:53,398
I was in a hurry.

272
00:15:53,466 --> 00:15:55,666
I was on my way to church

273
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:58,035
to say some Novenas for Thanksgiving.

274
00:15:58,104 --> 00:16:00,238
Thanksgiving is not a Catholic holiday.

275
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:03,174
Thanksgiving is very big with the Italians.

276
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:06,677
Turkey cacciatore, sweet potato parmigian--

277
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:10,014
There is no such thing as Thanksgiving in Italy!

278
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:11,516
It's an American holiday.

279
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:13,284
And I've been to Italy--

280
00:16:13,352 --> 00:16:14,519
To Florence, right?

281
00:16:14,587 --> 00:16:15,553
Yes.

282
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:17,955
Ever been to Sicily, by any chance?

283
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:19,224
No.

284
00:16:20,493 --> 00:16:23,328
Thanksgiving is very big in Sicily

285
00:16:23,395 --> 00:16:26,297
on account of the large number of Sicilians

286
00:16:26,365 --> 00:16:27,798
who went to America

287
00:16:27,866 --> 00:16:30,468
and then got thrown back out.

288
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,904
There were 2 cases of liquor

289
00:16:33,972 --> 00:16:35,607
in the back seat of that car.

290
00:16:35,674 --> 00:16:36,974
People drink too much.

291
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:38,843
Those 2 cases of liquor

292
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,878
were reported stolen from Kelly's Liquor

293
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:42,813
on Fifth Street earlier today.

294
00:16:42,881 --> 00:16:44,315
You're kidding me.

295
00:16:44,383 --> 00:16:47,218
I accidentally borrowed the wrong car

296
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:50,755
of a guy who stole some liquor earlier today?

297
00:16:50,822 --> 00:16:52,257
The car you stole

298
00:16:52,324 --> 00:16:55,826
belongs to the Reverend Malcolm Dickenson.

299
00:16:55,894 --> 00:16:59,664
He is the minister of the Presbyterian church

300
00:16:59,731 --> 00:17:01,366
here in Fryburg!

301
00:17:07,072 --> 00:17:09,940
Are you sure he's a minister?

302
00:17:10,008 --> 00:17:12,843
One of my best friends makes his living

303
00:17:12,911 --> 00:17:14,745
as a completely phony minister.

304
00:17:14,813 --> 00:17:16,247
For 2 bucks,

305
00:17:16,315 --> 00:17:18,049
I can make <i>you</i> a minister.

306
00:17:18,116 --> 00:17:20,051
Some guys steal your money,

307
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:23,188
but these guys, they steal your heart.

308
00:17:36,752 --> 00:17:38,486
Now? Can you see him?

309
00:17:38,554 --> 00:17:39,821
What's the license number?

310
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:41,656
Ma'am? E-N-4--

311
00:17:41,724 --> 00:17:43,157
Oh, uh, down the hall,

312
00:17:43,225 --> 00:17:44,459
One flight up to your left.

313
00:17:44,526 --> 00:17:46,394
Thank you. E-N-4.

314
00:17:46,462 --> 00:17:47,829
Call me Vinnie.

315
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:49,848
It says here your name's Todd.

316
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:52,217
Barney Coopersmith, FBI.

317
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:56,020
Hannah Stubbs of the district attorney's office.

318
00:17:56,088 --> 00:17:57,322
What's going on, Vinnie?

319
00:17:57,389 --> 00:18:00,124
You've got a ring of phony ministers stealing liquor.

320
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:01,425
Make me a minister.

321
00:18:01,493 --> 00:18:03,427
I'll go undercover, infiltrate them.

322
00:18:03,495 --> 00:18:04,996
We'll nail all these--

323
00:18:05,064 --> 00:18:06,364
OK, knock it off. What have you got?

324
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:09,000
Grand theft auto. Felony theft.

325
00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:11,169
Where's the car we gave you?

326
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:14,038
If I knew, I wouldn't have borrowed the other one.

327
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:15,406
We're arraigning him in the morning.

328
00:18:15,474 --> 00:18:16,407
No, you're not.

329
00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:17,909
We most certainly are.

330
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:18,977
This man

331
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:20,811
is in the federal witness program.

332
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,146
He's under the protection

333
00:18:22,214 --> 00:18:23,547
of the FBI.

334
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,983
What are you doing in my purse?

335
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,050
Just looking. Cute kids.

336
00:18:26,118 --> 00:18:27,051
Thank you.

337
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,786
Baseball fans? Yes.

338
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:30,889
That's your husband?

339
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:33,157
Not anymore.

340
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,227
Come on, Vinnie. Let's go.

341
00:18:38,764 --> 00:18:40,698
You're a good-looking girl,

342
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:42,533
except for those army shoes.

343
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:44,035
No wonder he split.

344
00:18:44,103 --> 00:18:45,103
Come on.

345
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:48,439
You ought to get a pair of nice high heels.

346
00:18:48,507 --> 00:18:50,909
Spectator pumps, I think they're called.

347
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:52,443
Where are you going?

348
00:18:52,511 --> 00:18:54,578
This man is a member

349
00:18:54,646 --> 00:18:56,014
of an organized crime family.

350
00:18:56,081 --> 00:18:57,681
They put that stamp on everybody.

351
00:18:57,749 --> 00:18:59,350
It's a stereotype, and I resent it.

352
00:18:59,418 --> 00:19:01,752
He has to testify at 2 major mob trials

353
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,521
in New York in the immediate future,

354
00:19:03,588 --> 00:19:07,058
so therefore you are not going to arraign him

355
00:19:07,126 --> 00:19:08,526
for anything tomorrow.

356
00:19:08,593 --> 00:19:11,662
Now wait just a minute.

357
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,898
This is not a dump site

358
00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:16,734
for the toxic waste of criminal America.

359
00:19:16,802 --> 00:19:18,369
That's my last mint.

360
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:19,870
Spit that out!

361
00:19:19,939 --> 00:19:23,207
Spit that out and return it to this woman!

362
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:42,226
Bring him back here!

363
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:44,562
Lady, this man is much more important

364
00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:47,065
than a couple of petty larcenies.

365
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:49,067
That's your opinion. You don't live here.

366
00:19:49,134 --> 00:19:51,569
But if I did, it would be comforting to know

367
00:19:51,636 --> 00:19:53,071
a narrow-minded fanatic

368
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:54,772
is looking out for this community.

369
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,007
Oh, really?

370
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:57,508
Oh, really?

371
00:19:57,576 --> 00:19:59,210
Oh, really?

372
00:19:59,278 --> 00:20:00,511
You gotta do better than that.

373
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,046
You're going to lose the argument.

374
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:03,581
Stay out of this.

375
00:20:03,648 --> 00:20:05,916
How long have you been in this job,

376
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:07,085
2 weeks?

377
00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:08,519
Go to hell!

378
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:10,388
Just go to hell!

379
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:11,889
Way to go!

380
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:14,258
What if he promises not to do it again?

381
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:16,394
Do me a favor. Tell her you won't do it again.

382
00:20:16,462 --> 00:20:19,397
I didn't do anything in the first place,

383
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:21,366
which is what I was trying to explain.

384
00:20:26,104 --> 00:20:28,539
I am not happy about this!

385
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:31,859
Lady, this is justice department policy.

386
00:20:31,927 --> 00:20:33,361
Well, they're wrong.

387
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:35,130
They're wrong, and I'm right!

388
00:20:35,197 --> 00:20:36,631
Let me ask you something.

389
00:20:36,698 --> 00:20:38,566
Have you ever been wrong about anything?

390
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:39,967
Yes.

391
00:20:40,035 --> 00:20:41,302
Once.

392
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,070
The shoes, right?

393
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:45,406
The shoes are tragic.

394
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:54,249
Creep.

395
00:20:54,316 --> 00:20:55,750
Disgusting, revolting, creep!

396
00:20:55,817 --> 00:20:57,318
I thought he was cute.

397
00:20:57,386 --> 00:20:58,953
Not that one. The other one.

398
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:07,878
Listen carefully, fluffy,

399
00:21:07,946 --> 00:21:09,880
'cause I'm only saying this once.

400
00:21:09,948 --> 00:21:12,583
Tommy and I are going down to grandma's house

401
00:21:12,651 --> 00:21:14,084
For Thanksgiving with dad.

402
00:21:14,152 --> 00:21:15,085
Do you remember dad?

403
00:21:15,153 --> 00:21:17,321
Yeah, he used to live here.

404
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:20,824
We're going to be back on Sunday night, though.

405
00:21:20,892 --> 00:21:23,160
Promise you won't flush him down the toilet?

406
00:21:23,228 --> 00:21:24,662
I can't promise anything.

407
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,663
Mom!

408
00:21:25,731 --> 00:21:27,164
I promise.

409
00:21:27,232 --> 00:21:28,499
Come here.

410
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:30,134
You scared me.

411
00:21:34,306 --> 00:21:36,073
So what's up?

412
00:21:36,141 --> 00:21:38,509
What are you doing today, mom?

413
00:21:38,577 --> 00:21:39,510
I'm working,

414
00:21:39,578 --> 00:21:41,178
So it's just as well you're going.

415
00:21:41,246 --> 00:21:42,846
I wouldn't be here anyway.

416
00:21:42,914 --> 00:21:45,349
Do you still love our dad?

417
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:47,752
No, but I still love you.

418
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:49,219
"and your dad loves you.

419
00:21:49,288 --> 00:21:50,788
That's all that really matters."

420
00:21:50,855 --> 00:21:52,156
Mm-hmm.

421
00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:55,125
Hey, everybody ready?

422
00:21:56,161 --> 00:21:57,261
Hi, dad.

423
00:21:57,329 --> 00:21:58,429
Hi.

424
00:21:58,497 --> 00:22:01,432
Now go on. Have a good time.

425
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,702
We'll talk about this when you get back Sunday.

426
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,103
Bye, mom.

427
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:07,104
Bye, mom.

428
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:08,272
Hi, dad.

429
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,573
Let's go!

430
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,344
Love you, mom!

431
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:15,680
Will...

432
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:17,682
you shouldn't just walk in here

433
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,384
like you still live here.

434
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:21,619
What, I'm supposed to ring the doorbell

435
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:23,120
in my own house?

436
00:22:23,188 --> 00:22:25,423
This is not your house anymore.

437
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:27,925
I may not live here, but it's still my house.

438
00:22:49,948 --> 00:22:51,516
He made me drink.

439
00:22:52,618 --> 00:22:54,752
I'm drinking in solitary.

440
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,053
Look at me.

441
00:22:56,121 --> 00:22:59,557
I-I'm cleaning in solitary.

442
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,560
Of course, you always clean in solitary.

443
00:23:02,628 --> 00:23:04,562
There's nothing new in that,

444
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,364
But still, drinking, muttering to myself,

445
00:23:06,432 --> 00:23:08,265
Compulsively scrubbing.

446
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:17,809
Oh!

447
00:23:37,662 --> 00:23:39,597
I don't like this, Kirby. Really.

448
00:23:39,664 --> 00:23:41,599
The guy's hanging around a bar.

449
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,467
He's looking to buy stolen credit cards.

450
00:23:43,535 --> 00:23:45,803
Could be a major criminal conspiracy.

451
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:47,605
I don't know.

452
00:23:47,672 --> 00:23:49,106
We go undercover.

453
00:23:49,173 --> 00:23:51,809
We blow this thing out of the water.

454
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:53,310
Who made you undercover?

455
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:54,311
I did.

456
00:23:54,379 --> 00:23:55,813
It doesn't work that way.

457
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:57,548
This is your big chance.

458
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:22,005
These are not the good ones.

459
00:24:22,073 --> 00:24:23,340
They got a limit.

460
00:24:23,408 --> 00:24:24,675
They don't all have limits.

461
00:24:24,743 --> 00:24:26,677
They might not be valid.

462
00:24:26,745 --> 00:24:28,145
Oh, they're good.

463
00:24:28,212 --> 00:24:30,648
I just got them from the post office.

464
00:24:30,715 --> 00:24:32,817
I work at the post office.

465
00:24:37,456 --> 00:24:39,824
I don't know your name, though.

466
00:24:39,891 --> 00:24:42,660
My name is Todd Wilkinson.

467
00:24:58,443 --> 00:24:59,710
Mrs. Stubbs!

468
00:24:59,778 --> 00:25:01,812
Hey, Mrs. Stubbs!

469
00:25:06,117 --> 00:25:07,551
We got one!

470
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:09,052
We got us a criminal.

471
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,554
No, we don't.

472
00:25:10,622 --> 00:25:13,390
We got us a criminal we already had.

473
00:25:14,626 --> 00:25:16,560
Mrs. Stubbs!

474
00:25:16,628 --> 00:25:18,562
As I live and breathe.

475
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,163
It's me, Vinnie.

476
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:25,068
I know who you are. I just met you.

477
00:25:26,638 --> 00:25:28,606
Oh! Oh, darn it.

478
00:25:32,644 --> 00:25:34,077
Brand-new shoes.

479
00:25:34,145 --> 00:25:36,079
No, these are old shoes.

480
00:25:36,147 --> 00:25:37,581
It's a miracle

481
00:25:37,649 --> 00:25:39,750
they lasted as long as they did.

482
00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:46,323
There could definitely be a transfer of stolen goods

483
00:25:46,391 --> 00:25:47,825
taking place right in front of our eyes.

484
00:25:47,893 --> 00:25:49,326
Don't be an idiot.

485
00:25:49,394 --> 00:25:50,661
What's with you lately?

486
00:25:50,729 --> 00:25:52,162
I'll take care of this.

487
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,332
Go home to your wife and family.

488
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,675
Hey, you can drive away. I won't follow you.

489
00:26:04,743 --> 00:26:07,177
I have another errand to run,

490
00:26:07,245 --> 00:26:08,679
if you don't mind.

491
00:26:08,747 --> 00:26:10,180
I don't mind.

492
00:26:10,248 --> 00:26:11,949
It'll give me a chance to thank you

493
00:26:12,017 --> 00:26:13,951
for what you did the other day,

494
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:16,453
Which, incidentally, the worst day of my life.

495
00:26:16,522 --> 00:26:18,222
I find that hard to believe.

496
00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:19,557
It's Thanksgiving.

497
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:21,058
I'm in a community

498
00:26:21,126 --> 00:26:22,960
where I know no one but my bartender.

499
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:25,462
My wife, God rest her soul,

500
00:26:25,531 --> 00:26:28,298
died 3 years ago to the day.

501
00:26:28,366 --> 00:26:29,967
I'm sorry to hear that,

502
00:26:30,035 --> 00:26:32,870
but that is no excuse for criminal behavior.

503
00:26:32,938 --> 00:26:34,338
Like your shoes,

504
00:26:34,406 --> 00:26:37,909
it's a miracle she lasted as long as she did.

505
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:45,482
Aw, jeez!

506
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,984
Look at these guys.

507
00:26:47,052 --> 00:26:48,986
Look how cute they are.

508
00:26:49,054 --> 00:26:51,989
Look at them frolic like this.

509
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:55,492
I'm sorry, Mrs. Stubbs.

510
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,995
I miss my dog, too.

511
00:26:58,897 --> 00:27:00,998
They made me leave my dog behind.

512
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:02,499
How you guys doing, huh?

513
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:05,002
They wouldn't let you take your dog?

514
00:27:05,904 --> 00:27:08,339
He only answered to his name.

515
00:27:08,407 --> 00:27:09,840
What was his name?

516
00:27:09,908 --> 00:27:11,742
Fungole.

517
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,077
Oh!

518
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,198
Need some help?

519
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:21,017
Yes. I would like a water turtle,

520
00:27:21,085 --> 00:27:24,037
and this gentleman is interested in a dog.

521
00:27:24,105 --> 00:27:25,590
Look at this guy.

522
00:27:25,657 --> 00:27:26,657
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

523
00:27:26,724 --> 00:27:27,658
Hey, hey, hey.

524
00:27:27,743 --> 00:27:28,692
Boo, boo, boo.

525
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,127
I'm not really.

526
00:27:30,194 --> 00:27:31,529
It'll be a long time

527
00:27:31,596 --> 00:27:33,531
before I can even be with another dog.

528
00:27:33,598 --> 00:27:35,699
What are you doing? All right, come on.

529
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:37,401
There you go.

530
00:27:40,104 --> 00:27:41,539
Oh, God.

531
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:43,541
I wish I could remember

532
00:27:43,608 --> 00:27:46,043
what the other one looked like.

533
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,545
The turtle died,

534
00:27:47,612 --> 00:27:50,047
and you're going to pass another turtle off

535
00:27:50,114 --> 00:27:52,049
as the dead turtle, right?

536
00:27:52,116 --> 00:27:53,150
Right.

537
00:27:53,217 --> 00:27:54,651
Trust me.

538
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,821
They all look alike.

539
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,874
That one.

540
00:28:02,143 --> 00:28:03,611
Pretty bird.

541
00:28:03,678 --> 00:28:04,795
Pretty bird.

542
00:28:06,648 --> 00:28:08,715
Polly want a cracker.

543
00:28:08,783 --> 00:28:11,702
It don't say Polly want a cracker.

544
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:13,570
What do it say?

545
00:28:13,638 --> 00:28:15,973
You're under arrest.

546
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:19,610
I once knew a guy had a parrot said that.

547
00:28:19,677 --> 00:28:21,311
Yeah?

548
00:28:22,647 --> 00:28:25,098
$2.04 with tax. Is that correct?

549
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:26,166
Right.

550
00:28:26,234 --> 00:28:27,768
Thank you very much.

551
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:28,853
You're under arrest.

552
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,354
I think I'm going to stay behind

553
00:28:30,421 --> 00:28:32,589
and get me a new dog.

554
00:28:32,657 --> 00:28:33,657
Excellent.

555
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:35,926
I'm very happy for you.

556
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:44,801
You dirty rat.

557
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:45,802
Snitch!

558
00:28:45,871 --> 00:28:47,004
Stool pigeon.

559
00:28:47,072 --> 00:28:48,472
Informer.

560
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:49,773
Squealer.

561
00:28:49,841 --> 00:28:52,343
You dirty rat.

562
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,611
I already said you dirty rat.

563
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:56,480
Yeah, but I say it better.

564
00:28:56,547 --> 00:28:58,548
Johnny Bird!

565
00:29:00,685 --> 00:29:02,619
I thought you was dead.

566
00:29:02,687 --> 00:29:04,621
That was the general idea.

567
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:05,789
Billy Sparrow.

568
00:29:05,857 --> 00:29:06,957
Todd Wilkinson.

569
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:08,959
Ooh, that's a good one.

570
00:29:09,027 --> 00:29:10,460
Who's the dame?

571
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,962
An assistant D.A.

572
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,630
I recently made the acquaintance of.

573
00:29:13,698 --> 00:29:15,132
They picked you up?

574
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,166
Misdemeanor.

575
00:29:16,234 --> 00:29:18,468
They don't have misdemeanors here.

576
00:29:18,536 --> 00:29:20,804
They just have felonies.

577
00:29:20,872 --> 00:29:22,172
Where's Linda?

578
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:24,975
She couldn't take it.

579
00:29:25,043 --> 00:29:27,477
Jeez, I'm glad to see you.

580
00:29:27,545 --> 00:29:29,313
I was feeling so...

581
00:29:29,381 --> 00:29:30,781
alone.

582
00:29:30,848 --> 00:29:33,117
You're not alone.

583
00:29:34,219 --> 00:29:37,854
You are <i>really</i> not alone.

584
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:50,150
Toot, toot!

585
00:29:52,087 --> 00:29:53,020
Barney!

586
00:29:53,088 --> 00:29:54,521
Barney, what a day.

587
00:29:54,589 --> 00:29:56,790
What a great day!

588
00:29:56,858 --> 00:29:58,825
What are you doing here, Vinnie?

589
00:29:58,893 --> 00:30:00,794
What am I doing here?

590
00:30:00,862 --> 00:30:02,296
I live here.

591
00:30:02,364 --> 00:30:04,164
I <i>live</i> here.

592
00:30:04,232 --> 00:30:05,665
We got to talk.

593
00:30:05,733 --> 00:30:07,667
What's the matter? You seem down.

594
00:30:07,735 --> 00:30:09,003
I'm not down.

595
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,504
You look depressed.

596
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:13,507
I'm going to take you and buy you a drink.

597
00:30:13,574 --> 00:30:16,010
I'm going to buy you a Flying Zombo.

598
00:30:16,077 --> 00:30:17,511
That'll cheer you up.

599
00:30:17,578 --> 00:30:19,513
I got to talk to you.

600
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,681
I'm with you.

601
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:24,218
I have a job, OK?

602
00:30:24,285 --> 00:30:25,719
I'm with you.

603
00:30:25,786 --> 00:30:28,022
My job's to protect and safeguard you

604
00:30:28,089 --> 00:30:30,224
so you can testify at 2 major trials

605
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:32,026
that are gonna send people to jail

606
00:30:32,093 --> 00:30:34,361
who are significantly more important than you.

607
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:35,729
When you testify,

608
00:30:35,796 --> 00:30:37,364
they'll try to destroy your credibility.

609
00:30:37,432 --> 00:30:39,066
If you get into trouble here

610
00:30:39,134 --> 00:30:42,102
you'll just make it easier for them to tear you down.

611
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,337
I'm with you.

612
00:30:43,405 --> 00:30:45,539
So you cannot commit credit card fraud.

613
00:30:45,606 --> 00:30:47,041
Who says I committed credit card fraud?

614
00:30:47,108 --> 00:30:48,042
Yo, Todd.

615
00:30:48,109 --> 00:30:49,543
Hey, how you doing?

616
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:51,545
We have pictures of it.

617
00:30:51,612 --> 00:30:54,548
I'm trying to tell you, I'm with you.

618
00:30:54,615 --> 00:30:56,250
When I say I'm with you,

619
00:30:56,317 --> 00:30:58,252
I don't mean it like an expression

620
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:00,087
like I'm saying I know what you mean.

621
00:31:00,155 --> 00:31:02,622
<i>I mean,</i> I'm with you.

622
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,059
I'm with the government.

623
00:31:05,126 --> 00:31:06,226
I'm undercover.

624
00:31:06,294 --> 00:31:07,528
Who made you undercover?

625
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:08,695
I did.

626
00:31:08,763 --> 00:31:10,264
It doesn't work that way.

627
00:31:10,331 --> 00:31:12,666
I'm ready to testify. He'll go to jail.

628
00:31:12,733 --> 00:31:14,101
I don't want you to testify.

629
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:15,769
I want you to keep your nose clean.

630
00:31:15,836 --> 00:31:17,137
<i>Capeece?</I>

631
00:31:19,874 --> 00:31:22,176
You trying to say <i>capisce?</I>

632
00:31:22,243 --> 00:31:23,343
Yeah.

633
00:31:23,411 --> 00:31:24,844
Well, don't do it,

634
00:31:24,912 --> 00:31:27,281
Because it hurts my ears when you do it.

635
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,155
Just out of curiosity, where's your wife?

636
00:31:35,223 --> 00:31:36,323
She, uh...

637
00:31:36,391 --> 00:31:37,824
got the chicken pox.

638
00:31:37,892 --> 00:31:39,826
It's terrible. She's in the hospital.

639
00:31:39,894 --> 00:31:41,295
Really?

640
00:31:41,362 --> 00:31:43,163
Did you tell somebody she was dead?

641
00:31:43,231 --> 00:31:45,265
Who told you this?

642
00:31:47,702 --> 00:31:50,137
OK, OK. Maybe I said it.

643
00:31:50,205 --> 00:31:52,672
She left me, Barney. Walked out the door.

644
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,675
Yeah, well, my wife left me, too.

645
00:31:55,743 --> 00:31:57,177
When did this happen?

646
00:31:57,245 --> 00:31:58,345
In October.

647
00:31:58,413 --> 00:32:00,680
That's when mine broke up.

648
00:32:00,748 --> 00:32:02,682
What is it about October?

649
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,184
I don't know.

650
00:32:04,252 --> 00:32:05,685
The pressure of Halloween?

651
00:32:05,753 --> 00:32:08,388
You never know what to go as.

652
00:32:09,557 --> 00:32:11,592
That cute D.A.

653
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:13,093
That's who I told.

654
00:32:13,161 --> 00:32:14,428
Hey.

655
00:32:14,496 --> 00:32:16,163
You and her maybe?

656
00:32:16,231 --> 00:32:17,831
Better chance of you and her

657
00:32:17,898 --> 00:32:19,099
than me and her.

658
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:20,601
No, not my type.

659
00:32:20,668 --> 00:32:23,103
I like them a little, uh...

660
00:32:23,171 --> 00:32:24,605
I don't know.

661
00:32:24,672 --> 00:32:26,106
Kind of dirty or something.

662
00:32:26,174 --> 00:32:28,609
You ought to take her out.

663
00:32:28,676 --> 00:32:30,110
You ought to marry her.

664
00:32:30,178 --> 00:32:31,612
I'm still married.

665
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,847
A guy in Reno will marry you even if you're still married.

666
00:32:33,914 --> 00:32:34,848
I'll arrange the whole thing.

667
00:32:34,915 --> 00:32:36,850
Do me a favor. Don't arrange anything.

668
00:32:36,917 --> 00:32:38,352
Don't do anything.

669
00:32:38,419 --> 00:32:40,854
Just lay low until we get through New York.

670
00:32:40,921 --> 00:32:42,489
Stay out of trouble.

671
00:32:43,758 --> 00:32:46,126
I'm with you.

672
00:32:46,194 --> 00:32:47,628
What's this?

673
00:32:47,695 --> 00:32:48,928
Oh.

674
00:33:03,194 --> 00:33:04,295
Surprise!

675
00:33:04,362 --> 00:33:05,829
Surprise!

676
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,667
Rocco Bamonte!

677
00:33:10,735 --> 00:33:12,369
Peter Baker.

678
00:33:12,437 --> 00:33:15,172
Peter Baker? That's fantastic.

679
00:33:16,107 --> 00:33:17,541
Richie Paolucci.

680
00:33:17,608 --> 00:33:19,543
No, no, no. Michael Peterson.

681
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,045
I was your pallbearer.

682
00:33:21,112 --> 00:33:22,947
I appreciate it, Vinnie.

683
00:33:24,115 --> 00:33:25,215
Vinnie!

684
00:33:25,283 --> 00:33:26,716
Nicky the Fish!

685
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,718
What are you doing here?

686
00:33:28,786 --> 00:33:30,720
It's great to see you, Vin.

687
00:33:30,788 --> 00:33:31,822
Hey!

688
00:33:31,889 --> 00:33:33,824
Dino! How are you, Dino?

689
00:33:33,891 --> 00:33:35,326
Boy, Vinnie, you look good.

690
00:33:35,393 --> 00:33:36,726
I can't believe this.

691
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:48,923
What the frig is this?

692
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,557
A popover.

693
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:52,293
There's nothing in it.

694
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,829
Last week I drove 43 miles to a restaurant

695
00:33:55,897 --> 00:33:58,332
I heard had good marinara sauce.

696
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,833
How was it?

697
00:33:59,901 --> 00:34:01,535
Please.

698
00:34:01,602 --> 00:34:02,937
They way I look at it,

699
00:34:03,004 --> 00:34:04,305
this is where you go when you die.

700
00:34:04,372 --> 00:34:06,307
Everything's so clean.

701
00:34:06,374 --> 00:34:07,607
Everybody's so nice.

702
00:34:07,675 --> 00:34:10,210
Good we're not broke, or we'd really be miserable.

703
00:34:10,278 --> 00:34:11,578
I'm broke.

704
00:34:11,646 --> 00:34:13,680
But you get your check every week

705
00:34:13,748 --> 00:34:15,182
From the government, right?

706
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:19,886
How long you think you get your check?

707
00:34:20,855 --> 00:34:22,089
Forever.

708
00:34:22,157 --> 00:34:23,257
Yeah?

709
00:34:23,325 --> 00:34:24,891
Here's to forever.

710
00:34:29,013 --> 00:34:30,431
What are you saying?

711
00:34:30,498 --> 00:34:31,948
Read the fine print.

712
00:34:32,016 --> 00:34:34,184
They only send you the check

713
00:34:34,251 --> 00:34:35,686
till you testify.

714
00:34:35,753 --> 00:34:36,953
Then...

715
00:34:37,021 --> 00:34:39,489
they actually expect you to go to work.

716
00:34:40,991 --> 00:34:42,225
Bastards.

717
00:34:42,293 --> 00:34:43,360
Creeps.

718
00:34:44,595 --> 00:34:46,029
What the hell?

719
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:47,531
We should go into business.

720
00:34:47,598 --> 00:34:50,367
There's enough of us here to start a crime wave.

721
00:35:09,421 --> 00:35:10,654
Hold it.

722
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:21,064
Come on, come on. Bring it in.

723
00:35:21,132 --> 00:35:22,699
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

724
00:35:31,476 --> 00:35:32,709
Hijacking.

725
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,584
See you guys later.

726
00:35:40,652 --> 00:35:42,085
Good night, Vinnie.

727
00:35:42,153 --> 00:35:43,587
Take care, Vin.

728
00:35:43,655 --> 00:35:45,589
Have a good one, Vinnie.

729
00:35:45,657 --> 00:35:47,591
Now, Vin, remember, no speeding!

730
00:35:47,659 --> 00:35:48,759
Watch yourself.

731
00:35:48,827 --> 00:35:51,361
OK, boys, back to work.

732
00:36:11,282 --> 00:36:14,217
We are not accusing you of anything but speeding

733
00:36:14,285 --> 00:36:16,219
at the moment, Mr. Wilkinson,

734
00:36:16,287 --> 00:36:18,054
but I'd like very much

735
00:36:18,122 --> 00:36:20,724
to know about the items in your trunk.

736
00:36:20,792 --> 00:36:21,892
Which items?

737
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,895
Well, let's start with the cassette players.

738
00:36:24,963 --> 00:36:27,397
I don't know anything about cassette players.

739
00:36:27,465 --> 00:36:29,733
There were 40 of them in your trunk.

740
00:36:29,801 --> 00:36:31,067
Oh.

741
00:36:31,135 --> 00:36:33,570
A guy I know won those in a contest.

742
00:36:33,638 --> 00:36:35,071
They were part of a shipment

743
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:36,573
that was hijacked 4 days ago

744
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:38,141
on the way to Radio Shack.

745
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:39,643
Oh, that's terrible.

746
00:36:39,711 --> 00:36:41,144
And the swordfish?

747
00:36:41,212 --> 00:36:42,646
I know this guy.

748
00:36:42,714 --> 00:36:45,649
His whole life is fishing,

749
00:36:45,717 --> 00:36:48,151
But he caught too many fish,

750
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:49,887
so he asked me,

751
00:36:49,954 --> 00:36:52,990
would I keep some fish in my freezer,

752
00:36:53,057 --> 00:36:55,993
but I don't have any room in my freezer

753
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,495
on account of another guy I know

754
00:36:58,563 --> 00:37:00,130
giving me a side of beef.

755
00:37:00,197 --> 00:37:03,600
So he put the fish in my trunk

756
00:37:03,668 --> 00:37:07,804
while the weather's cold, unbeknownst to me.

757
00:37:14,512 --> 00:37:15,846
Mr. Wilkinson...

758
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:20,450
put the ball away and sit down!

759
00:37:29,493 --> 00:37:30,794
The books.

760
00:37:30,862 --> 00:37:32,529
You got something against books?

761
00:37:32,597 --> 00:37:35,032
I have nothing against books.

762
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:36,466
I'm curious

763
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:38,936
about the books in your trunk.

764
00:37:39,003 --> 00:37:42,039
You see, I was thinking of writing my story,

765
00:37:42,106 --> 00:37:45,742
so I bought this book on how to do it.

766
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,744
Why do you need 25 copies of it?

767
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:57,754
In case I want to read it more than once.

768
00:37:57,822 --> 00:38:01,257
I'm sure it will come as no surprise to you

769
00:38:01,325 --> 00:38:03,159
to learn these books were part of a shipment

770
00:38:03,227 --> 00:38:04,561
that was hijacked yesterday

771
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:06,129
on the way to B. Dalton's.

772
00:38:06,197 --> 00:38:07,330
No!

773
00:38:07,398 --> 00:38:09,265
Yes! Mr. Wilkinson--

774
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,602
How's the turtle, Mrs. Stubbs?

775
00:38:12,604 --> 00:38:13,937
Fine, thank you.

776
00:38:14,005 --> 00:38:15,672
Did your kids ever figure out

777
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,173
you switched turtles on them?

778
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:19,442
Because I know it would be a major disappointment

779
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,444
for them to find out.

780
00:38:23,014 --> 00:38:24,514
Did you have a warrant?

781
00:38:24,582 --> 00:38:26,549
Barney, you know what this lady did?

782
00:38:26,618 --> 00:38:28,051
She whacked a turtle--

783
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:30,553
This man appears to have been

784
00:38:30,622 --> 00:38:33,056
in at least 3 major hijackings,

785
00:38:33,124 --> 00:38:35,558
just based on what we found in his trunk.

786
00:38:35,627 --> 00:38:39,062
Did you have a warrant to search his trunk?

787
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,230
No.

788
00:38:40,297 --> 00:38:41,732
See, she didn't even have probable cause.

789
00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:43,734
You had no right to search.

790
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:44,901
Probable cause.

791
00:38:44,969 --> 00:38:46,903
Jefferson put that in the constitution.

792
00:38:46,971 --> 00:38:48,404
Not for you.

793
00:38:48,472 --> 00:38:50,907
I'm exactly the guy he put it in for.

794
00:38:50,975 --> 00:38:52,408
Mrs. Stubbs, I admire your zeal.

795
00:38:52,476 --> 00:38:53,576
Don't patronize me.

796
00:38:53,645 --> 00:38:56,579
I'm the worst-case scenario of Jefferson's dreams.

797
00:38:56,648 --> 00:38:57,748
This way.

798
00:38:57,815 --> 00:38:59,750
Presumably, the statute of limitations

799
00:38:59,817 --> 00:39:01,752
will not have run out--

800
00:39:01,819 --> 00:39:04,254
I've been thinking of advising this man

801
00:39:04,321 --> 00:39:05,756
to get involved with you,

802
00:39:05,823 --> 00:39:07,257
but now I'm afraid I can't,

803
00:39:07,324 --> 00:39:08,258
because you are definitely

804
00:39:08,325 --> 00:39:09,760
losing your sense of humor.

805
00:39:09,827 --> 00:39:11,261
You can't touch him.

806
00:39:11,328 --> 00:39:12,763
I can, too!

807
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,230
If you ever had a sense of humor.

808
00:39:14,298 --> 00:39:15,732
When you finish testifying,

809
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,233
All bets are off.

810
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:18,568
Everybody thinks they're humorous,

811
00:39:18,636 --> 00:39:20,037
but they're not.

812
00:39:20,104 --> 00:39:22,472
You commit so much as a misdemeanor,

813
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,474
I'll throw the book at you.

814
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:26,476
OK, here's a test.

815
00:39:26,544 --> 00:39:28,912
What's the difference between a light bulb

816
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,613
and a pregnant woman?

817
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:33,817
What?

818
00:39:33,885 --> 00:39:36,853
You can unscrew a light bulb.

819
00:39:41,225 --> 00:39:44,728
See? No sense of humor whatsoever.

820
00:39:59,343 --> 00:40:02,011
Care for something to drink, ma'am?

821
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,179
No, thanks.

822
00:40:03,247 --> 00:40:04,681
Something to drink, sir?

823
00:40:04,749 --> 00:40:06,850
Let me borrow that pen again.

824
00:40:09,086 --> 00:40:11,788
What can I get you two to drink today?

825
00:40:11,856 --> 00:40:13,523
Ginger ale for me.

826
00:40:13,591 --> 00:40:15,792
2 double scotches, please.

827
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,027
We're only allowed to sell you 2 drinks.

828
00:40:18,095 --> 00:40:21,030
2 double scotches would be 4 drinks.

829
00:40:21,098 --> 00:40:22,198
I see.

830
00:40:22,266 --> 00:40:24,200
All right, how about this?

831
00:40:24,268 --> 00:40:26,202
You sell me my double scotch

832
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,304
and you sell my friend his double scotch,

833
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:30,306
but instead of putting his on his tray,

834
00:40:30,374 --> 00:40:33,309
you put it on mine, and I'll pay for you both.

835
00:40:33,377 --> 00:40:36,479
You look fantastic in red and blue...PAM.

836
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:38,548
All right, then.

837
00:40:38,616 --> 00:40:40,049
That'll be $12.

838
00:40:40,117 --> 00:40:41,551
OK, and, uh...

839
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:43,052
keep the change, please.

840
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,555
We're not allowed to accept tips.

841
00:40:45,623 --> 00:40:47,557
Not allowed to accept tips.

842
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:49,559
So your change is $8.00.

843
00:40:49,627 --> 00:40:50,727
Thank you.

844
00:40:50,795 --> 00:40:51,895
Thank you.

845
00:40:51,962 --> 00:40:54,397
Can I get you something, ma'am?

846
00:40:54,465 --> 00:40:56,900
Would you like something to drink?

847
00:40:56,967 --> 00:40:58,067
Bye.

848
00:40:58,135 --> 00:41:00,069
You tip a flight attendant?

849
00:41:00,137 --> 00:41:01,571
I tip everybody.

850
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,072
That's my philosophy.

851
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,340
See, actually,

852
00:41:04,408 --> 00:41:06,075
It's not tipping I believe in.

853
00:41:06,143 --> 00:41:08,010
It's overtipping.

854
00:41:08,078 --> 00:41:10,513
I think this is the kind of thing

855
00:41:10,581 --> 00:41:12,014
people would like to know.

856
00:41:12,082 --> 00:41:14,183
Give me that pen again.

857
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,724
American airlines flight 550

858
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:23,726
for San Francisco is now boarding...

859
00:41:23,794 --> 00:41:25,227
Vinnie, tomorrow morning

860
00:41:25,295 --> 00:41:27,229
you'll be seeing the prosecutors.

861
00:41:27,297 --> 00:41:28,364
Tomorrow morning

862
00:41:28,432 --> 00:41:30,232
I have an appointment with my tailor.

863
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,734
You're going over testimony.

864
00:41:31,802 --> 00:41:33,235
Gaetano's expecting me at 10:00.

865
00:41:33,303 --> 00:41:34,871
The next day you'll testify,

866
00:41:34,939 --> 00:41:36,372
after which we'll go back.

867
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,875
Don't let anyone know who you are

868
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:40,376
or that you're in town.

869
00:41:40,444 --> 00:41:41,878
You'll telephone no one.

870
00:41:41,946 --> 00:41:44,313
If anyone looks like they know you...

871
00:41:44,381 --> 00:41:45,348
Vinnie! Vinnie!

872
00:41:45,415 --> 00:41:46,516
Welcome home!

873
00:41:46,584 --> 00:41:48,017
We love you, Vinnie!

874
00:41:48,085 --> 00:41:49,619
Welcome home, Vinnie!

875
00:41:49,687 --> 00:41:51,387
I don't believe this! Are you crazy?

876
00:41:51,455 --> 00:41:53,790
Nobody knows I'm here but them.

877
00:41:53,858 --> 00:41:54,891
Vinnie!

878
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:56,626
Shh!

879
00:41:56,694 --> 00:41:58,461
Shh!

880
00:42:10,207 --> 00:42:11,641
Mama.

881
00:42:29,727 --> 00:42:33,162
Undo my cuffs so I can hug my own mother.

882
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,664
I can't do that, Vinnie.

883
00:42:34,732 --> 00:42:37,667
Don't make me look like a criminal

884
00:42:37,735 --> 00:42:39,502
in front of my mother.

885
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:40,837
Mama.

886
00:42:44,408 --> 00:42:45,474
Mama.

887
00:42:49,547 --> 00:42:51,147
Oh, mama.

888
00:42:52,382 --> 00:42:53,783
Mama.

889
00:42:56,253 --> 00:42:58,354
<i>Mio bambino.</i>

890
00:42:58,422 --> 00:42:59,656
Mama.

891
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:03,593
Barney.

892
00:43:19,342 --> 00:43:22,445
Hey, hey, hey, mama, mama, mama.

893
00:43:48,505 --> 00:43:51,608
I thought Wankel invented the rotary engine.

894
00:43:55,178 --> 00:43:56,278
Vinnie?

895
00:43:56,346 --> 00:43:57,279
Vinnie?

896
00:43:57,347 --> 00:43:58,581
Vinnie!

897
00:44:01,418 --> 00:44:02,852
<i>Vaca.</i>

898
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,111
Where the hell where you all night?

899
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:36,919
Vinnie, we're late.

900
00:44:36,987 --> 00:44:38,788
We have an appointment downtown.

901
00:44:38,856 --> 00:44:41,257
You see what I mean?

902
00:44:41,324 --> 00:44:42,458
Tragic.

903
00:44:42,526 --> 00:44:45,928
Barney, take a look at the 2 of us.

904
00:44:45,996 --> 00:44:47,964
Take a look.

905
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,135
You see, we don't match.

906
00:44:52,202 --> 00:44:53,736
You dress like this,

907
00:44:53,804 --> 00:44:55,604
you attract attention to me.

908
00:44:55,673 --> 00:44:56,939
That's dangerous.

909
00:44:57,007 --> 00:44:59,108
Wait till you see this.

910
00:45:01,812 --> 00:45:04,914
Wow. The worst.

911
00:45:05,883 --> 00:45:07,249
It's a pair of socks.

912
00:45:07,317 --> 00:45:09,118
Just try something different.

913
00:45:09,186 --> 00:45:11,453
Vinnie, I'm not interested in this.

914
00:45:11,521 --> 00:45:14,057
Of course you're not. We know this.

915
00:45:14,124 --> 00:45:15,524
If you were interested,

916
00:45:15,592 --> 00:45:17,093
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

917
00:45:17,161 --> 00:45:18,094
Thank you, Tommy.

918
00:45:18,162 --> 00:45:20,196
No wonder your wife left you.

919
00:45:20,263 --> 00:45:23,032
She didn't leave me because of my socks.

920
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,535
The wardrobe is a symbol of how you are.

921
00:45:26,603 --> 00:45:28,805
Now what do you think?

922
00:45:28,872 --> 00:45:31,540
Barney, listen to me.

923
00:45:31,608 --> 00:45:33,042
It's very hard

924
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:35,377
for a human being to change.

925
00:45:35,445 --> 00:45:38,147
I know this. I am an expert on this.

926
00:45:38,215 --> 00:45:39,782
So, sometimes...

927
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:41,884
in order for a human being to change,

928
00:45:41,952 --> 00:45:45,387
you have to change from the outside in.

929
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:49,225
Wow!

930
00:45:49,292 --> 00:45:51,060
You look beautiful.

931
00:45:51,128 --> 00:45:52,494
Come on.

932
00:45:53,463 --> 00:45:54,580
Tomorrow,

933
00:45:54,648 --> 00:45:56,582
as the Provolone trial continues,

934
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:57,850
the U.S. attorney's office

935
00:45:57,918 --> 00:46:00,353
is expected to call Vincent Antonelli,

936
00:46:00,421 --> 00:46:03,256
one of the chief lieutenants to Gazzo

937
00:46:03,324 --> 00:46:04,723
until September,

938
00:46:04,791 --> 00:46:07,593
when he entered the federal witness protection program.

939
00:46:07,661 --> 00:46:11,564
Look how young I look in that picture. Jeez.

940
00:46:11,631 --> 00:46:13,266
What do you want from room service?

941
00:46:13,334 --> 00:46:14,434
Nothing.

942
00:46:14,501 --> 00:46:16,269
You got to eat something.

943
00:46:16,337 --> 00:46:19,105
What I want is linguini at Bruno's.

944
00:46:19,173 --> 00:46:21,607
A little linguini, a little scungilli.

945
00:46:21,675 --> 00:46:24,110
I'll get you some Italian food.

946
00:46:24,178 --> 00:46:26,612
You think I like hotel rooms?

947
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,948
I'd like to order room service for 2.

948
00:46:29,016 --> 00:46:30,116
Room 606.

949
00:46:30,184 --> 00:46:32,485
Do you have any Italian food?

950
00:46:32,552 --> 00:46:34,587
What does that Italian dressing come on, salad?

951
00:46:34,654 --> 00:46:37,123
OK, I'll take one of those.

952
00:46:37,191 --> 00:46:38,891
And what kind of pasta do you have?

953
00:46:38,959 --> 00:46:40,493
Macaroni and cheese.

954
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,029
OK, I'll take one of those.

955
00:46:43,097 --> 00:46:45,164
What's this Chicken Volavent?

956
00:46:45,232 --> 00:46:46,665
Can you make that

957
00:46:46,733 --> 00:46:48,667
without the silky cream sauce?

958
00:46:48,735 --> 00:46:52,838
I just want it in a flaky pastry.

959
00:46:52,906 --> 00:46:54,374
OK, fine. Then--

960
00:46:55,642 --> 00:46:56,709
What are you doing?!

961
00:46:56,776 --> 00:46:58,077
I'm wrinkling up your jacket

962
00:46:58,145 --> 00:46:59,912
like you're wrinkling your pants.

963
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,981
What are you talking about? Why?!

964
00:47:02,049 --> 00:47:03,716
You bought a $1,200 suit.

965
00:47:03,783 --> 00:47:07,586
You hang up the jacket, but lay around in your pants.

966
00:47:07,654 --> 00:47:08,888
You're wrinkling the pants.

967
00:47:08,955 --> 00:47:10,423
Give me your pants.

968
00:47:10,491 --> 00:47:11,991
I'll hang them up.

969
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:13,726
What happens-- give me your pants--

970
00:47:13,793 --> 00:47:15,561
the pants go to the dry cleaners

971
00:47:15,629 --> 00:47:16,929
more than the jacket,

972
00:47:16,997 --> 00:47:19,932
and you end up with a suit that doesn't match.

973
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,934
I'll take this down to that pressing machine.

974
00:47:22,002 --> 00:47:23,436
Since we're staying in,

975
00:47:23,504 --> 00:47:25,371
order me the macaroni and cheese,

976
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,407
and get one of those little bottles of wine

977
00:47:27,474 --> 00:47:29,808
'cause I don't want to drink too much.

978
00:47:29,876 --> 00:47:32,345
Will I need change? No. No.

979
00:47:32,413 --> 00:47:33,612
They'll have change down there.

980
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,516
I'll be back in about 5 minutes, OK?

981
00:47:44,824 --> 00:47:45,891
Aarrgh!

982
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:50,629
Vinnie!

983
00:47:50,697 --> 00:47:52,098
Vinnie!

984
00:47:53,667 --> 00:47:54,733
Vinnie!

985
00:47:55,986 --> 00:47:57,587
So we open up the truck,

986
00:47:57,654 --> 00:47:59,922
and what is there but 6,000 watches?

987
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:01,757
I think, great, 6,000 watches.

988
00:48:01,825 --> 00:48:03,392
Hey, how you doing?

989
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,760
But what I don't realize

990
00:48:04,828 --> 00:48:06,762
is that each watch is worth 10 grand.

991
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:08,264
Now if you do your multiplication...

992
00:48:08,332 --> 00:48:10,099
May I help you, sir?

993
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:11,734
I'm meeting somebody.

994
00:48:14,838 --> 00:48:15,904
Vinnie!

995
00:48:15,972 --> 00:48:18,040
$60 million would buy the bar.

996
00:48:18,108 --> 00:48:20,075
So Eddie, make me the drink

997
00:48:20,144 --> 00:48:22,578
you made the night Mary was shot.

998
00:48:22,646 --> 00:48:24,614
I think it was a Bloody Mary.

999
00:48:24,681 --> 00:48:26,882
Psst! Vinnie.

1000
00:48:28,152 --> 00:48:29,318
Who's that?

1001
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,521
Come here.

1002
00:48:33,657 --> 00:48:34,757
It's Louie!

1003
00:48:34,824 --> 00:48:37,092
Louie Vinchenzi from San Francisco.

1004
00:48:37,161 --> 00:48:39,295
What are you doing here?

1005
00:48:42,732 --> 00:48:45,268
This man's so fast, he doesn't wear pants.

1006
00:48:45,335 --> 00:48:47,936
It slows him down. How was she?

1007
00:48:48,004 --> 00:48:49,438
Give me the suit, right now.

1008
00:48:49,506 --> 00:48:50,806
I can't believe you did this--

1009
00:48:50,874 --> 00:48:52,808
A $1,200 suit on my credit card.

1010
00:48:52,876 --> 00:48:54,943
You wanna have a good time or sit in the motel?

1011
00:48:55,011 --> 00:48:56,945
18% on my credit card.

1012
00:48:57,013 --> 00:48:58,814
Annette, give me that gray suit I gave you.

1013
00:48:58,882 --> 00:49:01,116
I'll be paying it off the rest of my life.

1014
00:49:01,185 --> 00:49:02,652
Champagne for everybody?

1015
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:04,153
What a fantastic guy.

1016
00:49:04,221 --> 00:49:06,121
I could've bought a VCR. Could've bought a new car!

1017
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:08,957
Don't get him mad.

1018
00:49:09,025 --> 00:49:11,327
I can't believe you did this to me.

1019
00:49:11,395 --> 00:49:12,861
All right. Let's go. Right now.

1020
00:49:12,929 --> 00:49:14,363
Relax. This is my territory.

1021
00:49:14,431 --> 00:49:15,864
Back to the motel.

1022
00:49:15,932 --> 00:49:18,367
I want to show you something.

1023
00:49:18,435 --> 00:49:19,868
You see those guys?

1024
00:49:19,936 --> 00:49:21,637
Yes, I do.

1025
00:49:21,705 --> 00:49:24,139
If they find out you're FBI,

1026
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:26,141
we have a problem.

1027
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:27,643
So, what'll it be,

1028
00:49:27,711 --> 00:49:29,645
the motel and TV

1029
00:49:29,713 --> 00:49:31,714
or drinking and girls?

1030
00:49:41,225 --> 00:49:43,359
Know what I noticed about you?

1031
00:49:43,427 --> 00:49:44,360
What?

1032
00:49:44,428 --> 00:49:46,329
You never look them in the eye.

1033
00:49:46,397 --> 00:49:47,497
Who?

1034
00:49:47,564 --> 00:49:49,665
Girls. You're a good-looking guy.

1035
00:49:49,733 --> 00:49:52,502
You're a better-looking guy than I am,

1036
00:49:52,569 --> 00:49:55,171
but I always look them in the eye.

1037
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:58,174
Therefore, I'll always get laid more than you,

1038
00:49:58,242 --> 00:50:00,843
which is fundamentally unjust, am I right?

1039
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:02,345
You're into justice.

1040
00:50:02,413 --> 00:50:04,680
This argument should appeal to you.

1041
00:50:04,748 --> 00:50:05,848
Come here.

1042
00:50:05,916 --> 00:50:07,016
What?

1043
00:50:07,084 --> 00:50:08,651
Leave your celery.

1044
00:50:12,256 --> 00:50:14,023
Hiya, girls. How ya doing?

1045
00:50:14,091 --> 00:50:15,891
My name's Vinnie. What's your name?

1046
00:50:15,959 --> 00:50:16,892
Angie.

1047
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,893
Angie. How are you?

1048
00:50:17,961 --> 00:50:19,028
What's your name?

1049
00:50:19,096 --> 00:50:20,229
Marie.

1050
00:50:20,297 --> 00:50:22,365
I'd like you to meet my brother-in-law Barney.

1051
00:50:22,433 --> 00:50:24,400
He invented that valve doohickey

1052
00:50:24,468 --> 00:50:26,102
on the artificial heart.

1053
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:28,037
Don't ask me to explain it.

1054
00:50:28,105 --> 00:50:29,872
Barney. What a great name.

1055
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,374
They always say that, even if your name is Morty.

1056
00:50:31,442 --> 00:50:33,709
Now look her right in the eye.

1057
00:50:33,777 --> 00:50:34,977
Hi, Marie.

1058
00:50:35,045 --> 00:50:36,112
Hi, Barney.

1059
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,714
What do you say we all dance?

1060
00:50:38,782 --> 00:50:41,217
Oh, Vinnie, no. I'd rather not.

1061
00:50:41,285 --> 00:50:42,718
Come on. I want to dance.

1062
00:50:42,786 --> 00:50:45,221
Do a little Merengue for us.

1063
00:50:45,289 --> 00:50:46,722
Merengue. All right.

1064
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:49,725
Don't take it easy on her. Let's go.

1065
00:50:50,794 --> 00:50:52,895
Pull it up. Pump up.

1066
00:50:58,302 --> 00:50:59,569
What are you doing?

1067
00:50:59,636 --> 00:51:01,404
You're too stiff. You're slouching.

1068
00:51:01,472 --> 00:51:02,738
You gotta stand up like this.

1069
00:51:02,806 --> 00:51:04,507
Buckle your knees a little.

1070
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,909
Move your hips.

1071
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:24,760
Hey, Barney.

1072
00:51:24,828 --> 00:51:27,430
Put your hand here like this.

1073
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,066
Ohh.

1074
00:51:31,135 --> 00:51:32,335
Do it.

1075
00:51:38,575 --> 00:51:39,875
Now watch this.

1076
00:51:46,683 --> 00:51:48,017
Do it.

1077
00:51:48,084 --> 00:51:49,218
Do it.

1078
00:53:29,803 --> 00:53:31,337
Vinnie! Aah!

1079
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,840
Aah!

1080
00:53:52,158 --> 00:53:53,959
Hey, Barney.

1081
00:53:55,161 --> 00:53:56,329
Yeah, Vinnie?

1082
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:02,368
Where'd you learn to shoot like that?

1083
00:54:04,671 --> 00:54:06,239
In the bureau.

1084
00:54:08,675 --> 00:54:10,576
Really?

1085
00:54:11,678 --> 00:54:12,911
Yep.

1086
00:54:14,548 --> 00:54:16,716
You saved my life.

1087
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,621
You saved my life.

1088
00:54:21,688 --> 00:54:24,123
We're in each other's debt forever.

1089
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:26,325
That's so great.

1090
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:32,064
Good night, Vinnie.

1091
00:54:32,132 --> 00:54:33,999
Good night, Barney.

1092
00:54:36,136 --> 00:54:38,554
And what happened then, Mr. Antonelli?

1093
00:54:38,622 --> 00:54:40,822
Mr. Capelli left the room.

1094
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:47,563
Did Mr. Gazzo say anything at this point?

1095
00:54:47,631 --> 00:54:50,366
Mr. Gazzo said, "kill the fart."

1096
00:54:50,433 --> 00:54:52,067
I apologize, your honor,

1097
00:54:52,135 --> 00:54:53,902
But that's what he said.

1098
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:56,071
To whom was he speaking?

1099
00:54:56,139 --> 00:54:58,073
Sonny, Frankie, Richie, Al--

1100
00:54:58,141 --> 00:54:59,975
the guys who were there.

1101
00:55:00,043 --> 00:55:02,478
And then they had a little eggplant

1102
00:55:02,546 --> 00:55:03,979
Benny's mother made.

1103
00:55:04,047 --> 00:55:05,514
She puts capers in,

1104
00:55:05,582 --> 00:55:07,349
which I think is a mistake.

1105
00:55:07,417 --> 00:55:09,918
Then they killed Nicky Capelli.

1106
00:55:09,986 --> 00:55:12,521
One behind the ear with a .22.

1107
00:55:12,589 --> 00:55:14,323
Richie loved to use .22s

1108
00:55:14,391 --> 00:55:15,857
'cause the bullets are small

1109
00:55:15,925 --> 00:55:17,226
and don't come out the other end

1110
00:55:17,294 --> 00:55:19,528
like a .45.

1111
00:55:19,596 --> 00:55:22,198
A .45 will blow a barn door

1112
00:55:22,265 --> 00:55:23,532
out the back of your head.

1113
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,033
Lots of dry-cleaning involved.

1114
00:55:25,101 --> 00:55:27,536
A .22 will just rattle around

1115
00:55:27,604 --> 00:55:29,538
like Pac-Man until you die.

1116
00:55:29,606 --> 00:55:31,373
Thank you, Mr. Antonelli.

1117
00:55:32,275 --> 00:55:33,475
You're welcome.

1118
00:55:33,543 --> 00:55:35,043
Your witness.

1119
00:55:35,111 --> 00:55:36,212
Mr. Antonelli,

1120
00:55:36,279 --> 00:55:38,046
Where exactly do you live?

1121
00:55:38,114 --> 00:55:39,215
Nowhere.

1122
00:55:39,282 --> 00:55:40,382
Objection.

1123
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:42,384
Mr. Levine knows perfectly well

1124
00:55:42,452 --> 00:55:45,053
the witness is unable to answer that question.

1125
00:55:45,121 --> 00:55:46,555
I withdraw the question.

1126
00:55:46,623 --> 00:55:48,056
Aren't you currently

1127
00:55:48,124 --> 00:55:50,392
in the federal witness protection program?

1128
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:51,560
Yes.

1129
00:55:51,628 --> 00:55:53,562
You're living somewhere in America

1130
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:55,364
under the protection of the federal government.

1131
00:55:55,432 --> 00:55:58,234
You agreed to testify against Mr. Gazzo.

1132
00:55:58,301 --> 00:56:00,102
And in exchange for this testimony,

1133
00:56:00,169 --> 00:56:01,570
you've been given immunity,

1134
00:56:01,638 --> 00:56:03,905
a nice house, and a weekly paycheck.

1135
00:56:03,973 --> 00:56:05,107
That correct?

1136
00:56:05,174 --> 00:56:08,444
That's not all I get.

1137
00:56:08,511 --> 00:56:10,779
Perhaps you could enlighten the jury

1138
00:56:10,847 --> 00:56:12,080
as to what else

1139
00:56:12,148 --> 00:56:13,582
the government's giving you

1140
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:14,916
in exchange for this testimony.

1141
00:56:14,984 --> 00:56:16,218
Sure.

1142
00:56:18,187 --> 00:56:21,123
I get to never see my parents again

1143
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:22,924
or my loved ones.

1144
00:56:22,992 --> 00:56:26,395
I get to live in a place...

1145
00:56:26,463 --> 00:56:28,897
it's OK. Don't get me wrong.

1146
00:56:28,965 --> 00:56:30,532
The air is clean.

1147
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,033
The people are nice.

1148
00:56:32,101 --> 00:56:34,870
But for a guy like me,

1149
00:56:34,937 --> 00:56:37,373
who was raised on the sidewalks

1150
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,608
of a city that never sleeps,

1151
00:56:39,676 --> 00:56:41,477
it's a living hell.

1152
00:56:41,544 --> 00:56:42,978
There were times

1153
00:56:43,045 --> 00:56:44,880
when I thought of giving it up,

1154
00:56:44,947 --> 00:56:47,283
particularly when my wife left me.

1155
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:49,785
They gave us a nice house

1156
00:56:49,852 --> 00:56:51,287
with flowers in front.

1157
00:56:51,354 --> 00:56:52,788
It made her sick.

1158
00:56:52,855 --> 00:56:55,791
But I made a deal with the government,

1159
00:56:55,858 --> 00:56:57,493
so I'm here to tell the truth.

1160
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,495
If you think I'm saying what I'm saying

1161
00:56:59,562 --> 00:57:02,498
about Mr. Gazzo killing Nicky Capelli

1162
00:57:02,565 --> 00:57:04,500
only because of the deal,

1163
00:57:04,567 --> 00:57:06,302
you got a point,

1164
00:57:06,369 --> 00:57:08,470
but it's still the truth.

1165
00:57:18,515 --> 00:57:20,816
What's the difference between a light bulb

1166
00:57:20,884 --> 00:57:22,317
and a pregnant woman?

1167
00:57:22,385 --> 00:57:23,819
I don't know.

1168
00:57:23,887 --> 00:57:26,655
You can unscrew a light bulb.

1169
00:57:26,723 --> 00:57:28,824
Michelle, a drink here for my friend.

1170
00:57:28,892 --> 00:57:31,159
Oh, I couldn't possibly.

1171
00:57:31,227 --> 00:57:32,661
Oh, come on, have a brandy.

1172
00:57:32,729 --> 00:57:34,329
Monks make it.

1173
00:57:34,397 --> 00:57:37,332
Vinnie, we'll have to work so hard

1174
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,502
next time we come to New York

1175
00:57:39,569 --> 00:57:42,004
so it won't be a letdown

1176
00:57:42,071 --> 00:57:43,338
after this trip.

1177
00:57:43,406 --> 00:57:45,173
What a fabulous time I had.

1178
00:57:45,241 --> 00:57:47,175
Although I got to admit,

1179
00:57:47,243 --> 00:57:50,178
it will be good to get back home.

1180
00:57:50,246 --> 00:57:52,347
Barney, I've been thinking.

1181
00:57:52,415 --> 00:57:54,850
It doesn't make any sense

1182
00:57:54,918 --> 00:57:56,986
for you to have a problem with that D.A.

1183
00:57:57,053 --> 00:57:59,588
Get off my back about the D.A.

1184
00:57:59,656 --> 00:58:01,423
I'm not talking about romance.

1185
00:58:01,491 --> 00:58:02,925
I'm just talking in general.

1186
00:58:02,993 --> 00:58:05,093
Why make war with the D.A.?

1187
00:58:05,161 --> 00:58:07,095
You gotta be out of your mind,

1188
00:58:07,163 --> 00:58:08,864
especially in your line of work.

1189
00:58:08,932 --> 00:58:10,365
So when you get back

1190
00:58:10,433 --> 00:58:12,367
try and make peace with her,

1191
00:58:12,435 --> 00:58:14,603
a little gesture to show you're friendly.

1192
00:58:14,671 --> 00:58:16,104
Why make war?

1193
00:58:16,172 --> 00:58:19,608
I mean, that's my philosophy anyway.

1194
00:58:19,676 --> 00:58:22,244
That's my philosophy.

1195
00:58:30,353 --> 00:58:31,787
Hi, Mr. Wilkinson.

1196
00:58:31,855 --> 00:58:33,288
Hi, Mr. Wilkinson.

1197
00:58:33,356 --> 00:58:35,290
Hi, kids. How ya doing?

1198
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:36,458
Hi, Todd.

1199
00:58:36,526 --> 00:58:37,960
Hi, Debbie. Hi, Brodie.

1200
00:58:38,028 --> 00:58:40,829
What a day for a mow, huh?

1201
00:58:40,897 --> 00:58:41,830
Hey, tiger.

1202
00:58:41,898 --> 00:58:43,632
Where'd you get that jacket?

1203
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,634
You look sharp.

1204
00:58:45,702 --> 00:58:47,469
Hey, baby.

1205
00:58:49,205 --> 00:58:51,006
Way to go, Coopersmith.

1206
00:58:52,709 --> 00:58:53,809
Coopersmith.

1207
00:58:53,877 --> 00:58:55,310
Good morning, sir.

1208
00:58:55,378 --> 00:58:59,214
You could use a little help yourself.

1209
00:59:12,729 --> 00:59:14,697
Who gave me this?

1210
00:59:31,081 --> 00:59:33,348
Hi, kids. My name is Todd.

1211
00:59:33,416 --> 00:59:34,950
I'm a friend of your mom's

1212
00:59:35,018 --> 00:59:36,685
from the office.

1213
00:59:36,753 --> 00:59:37,853
Hi, I'm Jamie.

1214
00:59:37,921 --> 00:59:38,854
I'm Tommy.

1215
00:59:38,922 --> 00:59:40,689
What are you doing here?

1216
00:59:40,757 --> 00:59:43,191
We have to leave right away.

1217
00:59:43,259 --> 00:59:45,193
Otherwise we're gonna miss batting practice.

1218
00:59:45,261 --> 00:59:46,194
Let's go.

1219
00:59:46,262 --> 00:59:47,696
Hey, we can't go.

1220
00:59:47,764 --> 00:59:49,231
We can't go.

1221
00:59:49,298 --> 00:59:50,365
Why not?

1222
00:59:50,433 --> 00:59:51,867
Of course you can.

1223
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,468
Now parking's always a problem

1224
00:59:53,536 --> 00:59:54,536
at the stadium,

1225
00:59:54,604 --> 00:59:56,538
so I've taken the liberty,

1226
00:59:56,606 --> 00:59:58,040
and I hope you don't mind,

1227
00:59:58,108 --> 00:59:59,441
of hiring a limousine.

1228
00:59:59,509 --> 01:00:00,960
A limo! Oh, yes!

1229
01:00:01,027 --> 01:00:02,394
Where is it?

1230
01:00:02,462 --> 01:00:04,196
Does it have a TV?

1231
01:00:04,263 --> 01:00:05,330
Awesome.

1232
01:00:05,398 --> 01:00:06,364
This is rad.

1233
01:00:06,432 --> 01:00:08,634
Oh, yes!

1234
01:00:12,806 --> 01:00:15,808
We can't possibly.

1235
01:00:15,875 --> 01:00:16,875
Oh, mom.

1236
01:00:16,943 --> 01:00:18,210
Why not?

1237
01:00:21,247 --> 01:00:23,115
Please, mom.

1238
01:00:23,183 --> 01:00:24,149
Yeah, please.

1239
01:00:24,217 --> 01:00:26,685
Come on.

1240
01:00:30,156 --> 01:00:31,423
Oh, thank you.

1241
01:00:31,491 --> 01:00:32,524
Yes!

1242
01:00:43,169 --> 01:00:44,436
Hey, mom. Vodka.

1243
01:00:44,504 --> 01:00:45,770
Put that away right now.

1244
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:48,440
Got any vodka? Hey, there you go.

1245
01:00:48,508 --> 01:00:50,409
Put your seat belts on.

1246
01:00:50,477 --> 01:00:52,711
Hey, you don't have to put them on in this.

1247
01:00:58,083 --> 01:00:59,117
Hot dogs!

1248
01:00:59,185 --> 01:01:01,119
Are these good seats or what?

1249
01:01:01,187 --> 01:01:02,954
Here's a program for you.

1250
01:01:03,022 --> 01:01:04,823
And you keep track of everything.

1251
01:01:04,891 --> 01:01:07,459
Never take your wallet out at the ball game.

1252
01:01:07,527 --> 01:01:09,695
Didn't your mother ever teach you this?

1253
01:01:09,763 --> 01:01:10,896
No.

1254
01:01:10,963 --> 01:01:12,398
Put this away.

1255
01:01:12,465 --> 01:01:15,634
How many hot dogs do we want, 2 each?

1256
01:01:15,702 --> 01:01:17,636
Real men always have 2.

1257
01:01:17,704 --> 01:01:20,138
OK, and 2 for your mother.

1258
01:01:20,206 --> 01:01:22,240
I don't want a hot dog.

1259
01:01:22,309 --> 01:01:24,242
She's probably on a diet, right?

1260
01:01:24,311 --> 01:01:27,112
My wife was always on a diet.

1261
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:28,980
My mother used to say,

1262
01:01:29,048 --> 01:01:31,082
Be careful of women on diets

1263
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:33,652
because they're always in a bad mood.

1264
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,086
And she was right, too.

1265
01:01:35,154 --> 01:01:38,089
My wife walked out on me at the low point of my life.

1266
01:01:38,157 --> 01:01:39,891
I thought your wife died.

1267
01:01:39,959 --> 01:01:41,393
I only wish.

1268
01:01:41,461 --> 01:01:43,629
2, 4, 6 hot dogs, please.

1269
01:01:43,697 --> 01:01:46,632
And keep the change on that and remember this section.

1270
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:49,201
Pass them down. Pass one to your mom.

1271
01:01:49,268 --> 01:01:51,203
Barney Coopersmith, what a coincidence.

1272
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:52,705
What do you mean?

1273
01:01:52,772 --> 01:01:54,206
You invited me.

1274
01:01:54,273 --> 01:01:55,708
It's an expression.

1275
01:01:55,775 --> 01:01:58,610
OK, you go sit next to her.

1276
01:01:58,678 --> 01:02:00,612
Everything doesn't have to be a war

1277
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:03,114
with you J. Edgar Hoover types.

1278
01:02:03,182 --> 01:02:04,115
Hi.

1279
01:02:04,183 --> 01:02:05,384
Hi.

1280
01:02:06,786 --> 01:02:10,155
The reason you never take your wallet out

1281
01:02:10,223 --> 01:02:11,890
at a ball game or anyplace else

1282
01:02:11,958 --> 01:02:14,727
is that someone's gonna steal it from you.

1283
01:02:16,095 --> 01:02:18,530
When you wave your wallet around,

1284
01:02:18,598 --> 01:02:20,899
they watch where you put it.

1285
01:02:20,967 --> 01:02:24,236
When you get up to go to the bathroom,

1286
01:02:24,303 --> 01:02:27,072
they follow you in and use a bumper.

1287
01:02:27,139 --> 01:02:28,907
They always use a bumper.

1288
01:02:28,975 --> 01:02:30,409
Bump into your brother.

1289
01:02:30,477 --> 01:02:31,643
This is how it works.

1290
01:02:31,711 --> 01:02:33,144
See that? You feel anything?

1291
01:02:33,212 --> 01:02:34,413
Well, look at this.

1292
01:02:34,481 --> 01:02:38,250
So always protect your wallet.

1293
01:02:46,459 --> 01:02:49,661
Play ball!

1294
01:02:49,729 --> 01:02:50,729
Yeah.

1295
01:02:50,797 --> 01:02:52,398
Play ball.

1296
01:02:58,221 --> 01:02:59,455
Padres! Padres!

1297
01:02:59,522 --> 01:03:01,189
Padres! Padres!

1298
01:03:01,257 --> 01:03:02,658
Padres! Padres!

1299
01:03:02,726 --> 01:03:04,576
Padres! Padres!

1300
01:03:06,613 --> 01:03:07,612
What?

1301
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,647
He was safe.

1302
01:03:23,195 --> 01:03:24,430
Nice day, huh?

1303
01:03:33,306 --> 01:03:34,907
Catch it!

1304
01:03:37,994 --> 01:03:39,428
That was awesome.

1305
01:03:39,496 --> 01:03:40,929
Yeah, how about that?

1306
01:03:42,265 --> 01:03:43,698
You kids play baseball?

1307
01:03:43,766 --> 01:03:45,334
We play in the field behind the mall.

1308
01:03:45,402 --> 01:03:46,835
I know that field.

1309
01:03:46,903 --> 01:03:48,303
It's in bad condition, though.

1310
01:03:48,371 --> 01:03:51,306
Every time it rains, it gets all yucky.

1311
01:03:51,374 --> 01:03:53,808
A dome is what you need.

1312
01:03:53,876 --> 01:03:56,711
The first little league in America with a dome.

1313
01:03:56,779 --> 01:03:58,213
Really, it's a worthwhile cause.

1314
01:03:58,281 --> 01:04:00,149
You ought to raise money for it.

1315
01:04:00,216 --> 01:04:01,650
It's a cocktail party

1316
01:04:01,717 --> 01:04:03,052
for law-enforcement personnel

1317
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:05,054
in the San Diego area.

1318
01:04:05,121 --> 01:04:08,057
If you'd like to come with me.

1319
01:04:08,124 --> 01:04:09,224
Yes.

1320
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:10,559
I would.

1321
01:04:10,626 --> 01:04:12,294
I'll call you.

1322
01:04:58,691 --> 01:05:01,292
You know, it's dangerous for you to be here

1323
01:05:01,361 --> 01:05:03,462
in the frozen food section.

1324
01:05:03,529 --> 01:05:05,630
Why is that?

1325
01:05:05,698 --> 01:05:09,468
Because you could melt all this stuff.

1326
01:05:09,535 --> 01:05:10,669
Ahh.

1327
01:05:15,941 --> 01:05:17,376
By the way,

1328
01:05:17,443 --> 01:05:18,877
My name's Shaldeen.

1329
01:05:18,944 --> 01:05:20,211
Hiya, Shaldeen.

1330
01:05:20,279 --> 01:05:21,546
What's yours?

1331
01:05:21,614 --> 01:05:23,081
My name's Todd.

1332
01:05:23,148 --> 01:05:26,568
Todd. That's a beautiful name.

1333
01:05:26,636 --> 01:05:28,553
It's Italian for...

1334
01:05:28,621 --> 01:05:30,989
"extra special."

1335
01:05:44,971 --> 01:05:46,104
Hello.

1336
01:05:46,172 --> 01:05:47,572
Barney, how ya doing?

1337
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:48,974
What's going on, Vinnie?

1338
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:50,475
I'm in Reno.

1339
01:05:50,542 --> 01:05:51,977
I just got married.

1340
01:05:52,044 --> 01:05:53,044
You got what?

1341
01:05:53,112 --> 01:05:54,112
Married!

1342
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:55,580
Say hello to Shaldeen.

1343
01:05:55,648 --> 01:05:58,984
Shaldeen, say hello to Barney.

1344
01:05:59,051 --> 01:06:00,085
Hi, Barney.

1345
01:06:00,153 --> 01:06:01,253
Hi, Shaldeen.

1346
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,188
Can you put Vinnie back on, please?

1347
01:06:03,256 --> 01:06:04,322
Bye.

1348
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:05,857
You love her or what?

1349
01:06:05,925 --> 01:06:08,260
I don't understand. You're already married.

1350
01:06:08,327 --> 01:06:10,962
I didn't marry her under my real name.

1351
01:06:11,247 --> 01:06:14,532
I said, Vinnie, you're already married.

1352
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,934
He said, don't worry.

1353
01:06:16,002 --> 01:06:17,569
I didn't marry her under my real name.

1354
01:06:20,006 --> 01:06:22,341
Don't tell me you're gonna book him for bigamy?

1355
01:06:22,408 --> 01:06:23,375
No.

1356
01:06:23,443 --> 01:06:25,610
Hannah doesn't find him as funny as I do.

1357
01:06:25,678 --> 01:06:27,612
I see that it's funny.

1358
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,115
I have a sense of humor.

1359
01:06:30,183 --> 01:06:31,616
Of course you have.

1360
01:06:31,684 --> 01:06:33,118
Everyone thinks they have,

1361
01:06:33,186 --> 01:06:35,920
even people who don't.

1362
01:06:41,527 --> 01:06:43,095
You look nice.

1363
01:06:44,697 --> 01:06:45,897
Thanks.

1364
01:06:47,533 --> 01:06:49,301
Do you want to dance?

1365
01:06:49,369 --> 01:06:50,635
I'm a terrible dancer.

1366
01:06:50,703 --> 01:06:52,137
So am i,

1367
01:06:52,205 --> 01:06:54,639
but I can do the Merengue.

1368
01:06:54,707 --> 01:06:56,875
They're not playing the Merengue.

1369
01:06:58,711 --> 01:06:59,944
They will.

1370
01:07:10,123 --> 01:07:12,190
Thank you.

1371
01:07:12,258 --> 01:07:13,425
1, 2.

1372
01:09:07,756 --> 01:09:09,758
She's a therapist.

1373
01:09:09,825 --> 01:09:11,693
He owns a lumberyard.

1374
01:09:11,761 --> 01:09:14,696
She left me for one of her patients.

1375
01:09:14,764 --> 01:09:16,197
He left me

1376
01:09:16,265 --> 01:09:18,867
for someone I was in a car-pool with.

1377
01:09:18,934 --> 01:09:22,236
Jamie, the 9-year-old, is the serious one.

1378
01:09:22,304 --> 01:09:24,406
You know how it is with brothers.

1379
01:09:24,473 --> 01:09:26,240
If one's serious, the other one's funny.

1380
01:09:26,308 --> 01:09:28,576
Like with me and my brother.

1381
01:09:28,644 --> 01:09:30,077
You're the serious one.

1382
01:09:30,145 --> 01:09:31,579
I'm the funny one.

1383
01:09:31,647 --> 01:09:32,714
Really.

1384
01:09:32,782 --> 01:09:34,081
She moved to Wichita,

1385
01:09:34,149 --> 01:09:36,083
And I haven't seen her since.

1386
01:09:36,151 --> 01:09:37,585
I see him constantly.

1387
01:09:37,653 --> 01:09:41,856
He walks into the house without even knocking.

1388
01:09:41,924 --> 01:09:44,258
Would you like to come in

1389
01:09:44,326 --> 01:09:46,093
for some coffee or something?

1390
01:09:46,161 --> 01:09:48,663
Well, if it won't wake up the kids.

1391
01:09:48,731 --> 01:09:51,733
The kids are at my mother's.

1392
01:09:55,170 --> 01:09:57,839
Your kids are at your mothers?

1393
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:48,957
Good morning!

1394
01:10:49,024 --> 01:10:50,291
Guys!

1395
01:10:50,359 --> 01:10:51,459
Hiya.

1396
01:10:51,527 --> 01:10:52,460
Hey.

1397
01:10:52,528 --> 01:10:53,628
Oh!

1398
01:10:53,696 --> 01:10:55,997
You want to come into this house,

1399
01:10:56,064 --> 01:10:57,465
you ring the damn bell!

1400
01:10:57,533 --> 01:10:58,600
I'm sorry.

1401
01:10:58,667 --> 01:11:00,602
Do you mind getting the door, please?

1402
01:11:00,669 --> 01:11:02,069
Thank you.

1403
01:11:02,137 --> 01:11:03,070
Oh!

1404
01:11:03,138 --> 01:11:04,071
Aah!

1405
01:11:04,139 --> 01:11:05,373
Oh! Ooh!

1406
01:11:28,497 --> 01:11:30,432
You've chosen the right agent, sir.

1407
01:11:30,499 --> 01:11:31,666
Barney,

1408
01:11:31,733 --> 01:11:33,168
I've got you

1409
01:11:33,235 --> 01:11:35,170
the assignment of your dreams!

1410
01:11:35,237 --> 01:11:36,671
You're going undercover, buddy.

1411
01:11:36,738 --> 01:11:37,838
Congratulations.

1412
01:11:37,906 --> 01:11:40,341
We're launching a major sting operation tomorrow.

1413
01:11:40,409 --> 01:11:41,842
Step into my parlor.

1414
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:43,344
At 1300 hours.

1415
01:11:43,412 --> 01:11:44,845
Synchronize your watches, men.

1416
01:11:44,913 --> 01:11:46,347
We get to be Canadians!

1417
01:11:46,415 --> 01:11:48,849
I still have the witness to look after

1418
01:11:48,917 --> 01:11:50,351
Until he appears in court.

1419
01:11:50,419 --> 01:11:52,353
He has one more court appearance.

1420
01:11:52,421 --> 01:11:53,354
When?

1421
01:11:53,422 --> 01:11:54,855
In 3 weeks.

1422
01:11:54,923 --> 01:11:56,857
This is an important assignment.

1423
01:11:56,925 --> 01:11:58,359
You're gonna be out

1424
01:11:58,427 --> 01:11:59,860
for as long as it takes--

1425
01:11:59,928 --> 01:12:01,696
4 weeks, 8 weeks, however long.

1426
01:12:01,763 --> 01:12:03,030
I'll make sure

1427
01:12:03,099 --> 01:12:04,532
someone's assigned to your witness.

1428
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,867
I assume that he'll stay out of trouble

1429
01:12:06,935 --> 01:12:08,369
in the meantime, Coopersmith?

1430
01:12:08,437 --> 01:12:10,371
He just fell in love, sir.

1431
01:12:10,439 --> 01:12:12,707
You know how it is when you fall in love.

1432
01:12:12,774 --> 01:12:13,841
Sir?

1433
01:12:15,777 --> 01:12:17,011
Undercover!

1434
01:12:20,116 --> 01:12:21,349
Undercover.

1435
01:12:21,417 --> 01:12:22,850
You can't even call?

1436
01:12:22,918 --> 01:12:24,352
We'll be stashed away.

1437
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:25,853
You can't use the phone

1438
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:28,223
for anything that's not related to the job.

1439
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:29,890
Someone could be tapping the phone.

1440
01:12:29,958 --> 01:12:31,392
You could jeopardize

1441
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:33,027
the entire investigation.

1442
01:12:35,297 --> 01:12:37,398
But you just got here.

1443
01:12:49,145 --> 01:12:51,912
OK, fellas, this is it.

1444
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:53,080
Let's go!

1445
01:12:54,316 --> 01:12:55,750
All right, get this:

1446
01:12:55,817 --> 01:12:57,752
You're Harry Redleaf, and you're Dicky Thorson.

1447
01:12:57,819 --> 01:12:59,254
You're from Vancouver,

1448
01:12:59,321 --> 01:13:00,755
and you're in town to buy stolen goods

1449
01:13:00,822 --> 01:13:02,257
rrom a major hijacking ring.

1450
01:13:02,324 --> 01:13:03,758
They'll contact you

1451
01:13:03,825 --> 01:13:06,127
when they're ready to fence their goods.

1452
01:13:06,195 --> 01:13:07,629
When will that be?

1453
01:13:07,696 --> 01:13:10,632
Not today. It will be whenever it will be.

1454
01:13:10,699 --> 01:13:13,134
So, me and Barney just sit here waiting?

1455
01:13:13,202 --> 01:13:14,135
That's right.

1456
01:13:14,203 --> 01:13:15,637
It will be a lot easier

1457
01:13:15,704 --> 01:13:17,272
If you start calling each other

1458
01:13:17,339 --> 01:13:18,439
Harry and Dicky.

1459
01:13:18,507 --> 01:13:20,642
So, Dicky and me just sit here waiting?

1460
01:13:20,709 --> 01:13:24,078
I hate that name. I really hate that name!

1461
01:13:26,248 --> 01:13:29,350
Have a nice day at the office, honey.

1462
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:33,320
See you later, darling.

1463
01:13:33,388 --> 01:13:34,455
Bye, honey.

1464
01:13:35,691 --> 01:13:37,625
Jesus, look at this shit!

1465
01:13:37,693 --> 01:13:40,061
Oh, look at this rain!

1466
01:13:40,129 --> 01:13:43,031
Bring it back here, Epstein!

1467
01:13:43,098 --> 01:13:44,532
Back it up!

1468
01:13:44,599 --> 01:13:46,634
Pull it a little to the left,

1469
01:13:46,702 --> 01:13:48,036
Just a little bit!

1470
01:13:48,103 --> 01:13:50,705
Take it easy! That's it, hold it!

1471
01:13:55,343 --> 01:13:57,779
Ah, what the hell is this?

1472
01:13:57,846 --> 01:13:59,147
Where are the stereos?

1473
01:13:59,214 --> 01:14:01,649
How are we going to fence this shit?

1474
01:14:01,717 --> 01:14:03,151
All right, guys, what do you got?

1475
01:14:03,218 --> 01:14:05,653
We got two big spenders in town.

1476
01:14:05,721 --> 01:14:07,655
We got nothing to sell them.

1477
01:14:07,723 --> 01:14:09,157
What the hell

1478
01:14:09,224 --> 01:14:10,992
are we supposed to do with these?

1479
01:14:15,664 --> 01:14:18,265
How many of these we got?

1480
01:14:23,505 --> 01:14:25,439
See, you guys see a problem.

1481
01:14:25,507 --> 01:14:26,941
I see potential.

1482
01:14:32,481 --> 01:14:34,032
Have a nice day.

1483
01:14:35,801 --> 01:14:37,234
How you doing?

1484
01:14:37,302 --> 01:14:39,737
Would you mind us leaving this bottle here

1485
01:14:39,805 --> 01:14:41,238
to raise money

1486
01:14:41,306 --> 01:14:42,740
for the Fryburg little league?

1487
01:14:42,808 --> 01:14:44,175
Ha. Not at all.

1488
01:14:51,483 --> 01:14:53,384
Have a nice day.

1489
01:15:10,669 --> 01:15:11,969
Hiya, kids!

1490
01:15:19,477 --> 01:15:21,579
I'll see you next week.

1491
01:15:27,352 --> 01:15:29,787
Lost track of how long we've been in here.

1492
01:15:29,855 --> 01:15:31,288
Give us a clue. Give me some idea.

1493
01:15:31,356 --> 01:15:32,790
I don't know what's happening.

1494
01:15:32,858 --> 01:15:34,291
We lost contact temporarily.

1495
01:15:34,359 --> 01:15:36,293
What are we supposed to do in the meantime here?

1496
01:15:36,361 --> 01:15:38,429
I'm wasting the best years of my life for nothing.

1497
01:15:38,496 --> 01:15:42,299
I got a wife and a family I'm not with, Dicky,

1498
01:15:42,367 --> 01:15:43,801
But you don't hear me complaining.

1499
01:15:47,706 --> 01:15:50,641
You call me Dicky one more time,

1500
01:15:50,709 --> 01:15:52,143
And I'll kill you.

1501
01:16:07,459 --> 01:16:08,659
Thank you.

1502
01:16:11,663 --> 01:16:13,131
Hi, Todd! Hi, Todd!

1503
01:16:14,733 --> 01:16:16,868
Hiya, Tommy. Hiya, Jamie.

1504
01:16:16,935 --> 01:16:18,970
What's all that money for?

1505
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:23,975
I don't know.

1506
01:16:24,042 --> 01:16:24,976
Race ya!

1507
01:16:25,043 --> 01:16:26,477
I'm first, I'm first!

1508
01:16:26,544 --> 01:16:28,980
I don't know what kind I'm getting.

1509
01:16:29,047 --> 01:16:31,482
What can I do for you?

1510
01:16:31,549 --> 01:16:32,984
I don't know yet.

1511
01:16:33,051 --> 01:16:36,520
Got to look around. That looks really good.

1512
01:16:36,588 --> 01:16:38,156
Take your time.

1513
01:16:39,258 --> 01:16:41,192
I'll get chocolate chip.

1514
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:42,193
Coming up.

1515
01:16:42,261 --> 01:16:43,327
Okey-doke.

1516
01:16:46,431 --> 01:16:47,865
It's $1.00, right?

1517
01:16:47,933 --> 01:16:50,001
Mm-hmm, $1.00.

1518
01:16:52,271 --> 01:16:53,704
Chocolate chip.

1519
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:57,275
You want the cone or what?

1520
01:16:57,342 --> 01:16:59,277
I changed my mind.

1521
01:17:00,179 --> 01:17:01,279
Sorry.

1522
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:04,515
Maybe he'll put in night lights!

1523
01:17:04,582 --> 01:17:07,018
No, he'll put in a dome and astroturf.

1524
01:17:07,085 --> 01:17:09,520
Mom, you should've seen the money in the bottle.

1525
01:17:09,587 --> 01:17:11,022
There's like trillions of dollars.

1526
01:17:11,089 --> 01:17:12,523
And it was our idea.

1527
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:14,025
Well, not exactly our idea,

1528
01:17:14,092 --> 01:17:16,527
But we told him how awful the field was.

1529
01:17:16,594 --> 01:17:18,029
He might even put in bleachers.

1530
01:17:18,096 --> 01:17:19,030
Oh, yeah!

1531
01:17:19,097 --> 01:17:20,531
And astroturf again!

1532
01:17:20,598 --> 01:17:22,333
And maybe even a dome.

1533
01:17:47,359 --> 01:17:48,425
All right.

1534
01:18:00,638 --> 01:18:02,857
It's the first time in my life

1535
01:18:02,925 --> 01:18:05,359
I try to do something for someone,

1536
01:18:05,427 --> 01:18:07,028
repay my debt to society,

1537
01:18:07,096 --> 01:18:09,030
and you arrest me for it.

1538
01:18:09,098 --> 01:18:11,032
He might be telling the truth.

1539
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:13,034
It was all for the community.

1540
01:18:13,102 --> 01:18:15,036
I swear on my mother's life.

1541
01:18:15,104 --> 01:18:16,537
Let me do this.

1542
01:18:16,605 --> 01:18:18,039
I live here.

1543
01:18:18,107 --> 01:18:19,941
This is my home.

1544
01:18:20,009 --> 01:18:21,442
For better or for worse.

1545
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:22,944
I love it here.

1546
01:18:23,012 --> 01:18:25,446
And you were going to give the money

1547
01:18:25,514 --> 01:18:26,948
to the community, weren't you?

1548
01:18:27,016 --> 01:18:28,249
Yes. Yes!

1549
01:18:28,316 --> 01:18:30,084
See, he was going to give the money

1550
01:18:30,152 --> 01:18:31,252
to the community.

1551
01:18:31,319 --> 01:18:33,087
When were you going to give the money

1552
01:18:33,155 --> 01:18:34,756
to the community?

1553
01:18:34,823 --> 01:18:37,258
When I had all of it, obviously.

1554
01:18:37,325 --> 01:18:39,493
Listen, Mrs. Stubbs...

1555
01:18:39,561 --> 01:18:40,962
Over here.

1556
01:18:41,030 --> 01:18:42,964
Against the wall, sir.

1557
01:18:43,032 --> 01:18:44,966
I'm a new man.

1558
01:18:45,034 --> 01:18:47,468
This is not the old me.

1559
01:18:47,536 --> 01:18:49,470
This is the new me.

1560
01:18:49,538 --> 01:18:52,273
He seems like a completely different person.

1561
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:53,841
He seems totally different.

1562
01:18:53,909 --> 01:18:55,843
Anyway, I'm not your problem.

1563
01:18:55,911 --> 01:18:58,846
You have major crime going on right here

1564
01:18:58,914 --> 01:19:00,347
under your nose.

1565
01:19:00,415 --> 01:19:01,949
You're wasting your time with me.

1566
01:19:02,017 --> 01:19:03,250
I'm nothing.

1567
01:19:03,318 --> 01:19:04,886
I'm small potatoes.

1568
01:19:08,323 --> 01:19:09,757
What I could tell you

1569
01:19:09,825 --> 01:19:11,625
about what's going on around here

1570
01:19:11,694 --> 01:19:12,827
if I wanted to,

1571
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:13,995
It's big.

1572
01:19:14,063 --> 01:19:16,130
Come on, buddy.

1573
01:19:16,198 --> 01:19:18,632
What if he's telling the truth?

1574
01:19:18,701 --> 01:19:20,835
At least listen to him.

1575
01:19:28,711 --> 01:19:30,044
OK.

1576
01:19:30,112 --> 01:19:31,179
What?

1577
01:19:32,547 --> 01:19:35,649
Two of the biggest fences in north America

1578
01:19:35,718 --> 01:19:37,651
Are sitting right here in Fryburg,

1579
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,486
ready to make a deal

1580
01:19:39,554 --> 01:19:41,989
on everything in town that isn't nailed down.

1581
01:19:42,057 --> 01:19:44,491
They're looking to buy a ton of swag

1582
01:19:44,559 --> 01:19:46,828
and ship it out of here in boxcars.

1583
01:19:50,365 --> 01:19:51,799
Hannah!

1584
01:19:53,335 --> 01:19:56,437
Are you trying to make a deal with me?

1585
01:19:59,742 --> 01:20:02,076
I don't know. Am I?

1586
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:08,416
There's no deal if they're not here.

1587
01:20:08,483 --> 01:20:09,417
They're here.

1588
01:20:09,484 --> 01:20:11,785
If he said they're here, they'll be here.

1589
01:20:11,853 --> 01:20:13,688
Yeah. Harry Redleaf and Dicky Thorson.

1590
01:20:13,755 --> 01:20:15,189
From Vancouver.

1591
01:20:15,257 --> 01:20:17,425
Did I tell you they were from Vancouver,

1592
01:20:17,492 --> 01:20:19,927
or did I tell you they were from Vancouver?

1593
01:20:19,994 --> 01:20:20,928
Let's go.

1594
01:20:20,995 --> 01:20:22,430
First left out the door.

1595
01:20:22,497 --> 01:20:23,997
Here you go. Thank you.

1596
01:20:24,065 --> 01:20:26,017
They never leave the room.

1597
01:20:26,085 --> 01:20:27,518
They just sit there

1598
01:20:27,586 --> 01:20:29,020
like they're waiting on something.

1599
01:20:29,088 --> 01:20:32,156
Did I tell you, or did I tell you?

1600
01:20:32,224 --> 01:20:33,658
What about male customers

1601
01:20:33,725 --> 01:20:35,159
buying things for their wives?

1602
01:20:35,227 --> 01:20:37,361
They all watch Oprah Winfrey.

1603
01:20:39,898 --> 01:20:41,399
Police!

1604
01:20:41,466 --> 01:20:42,400
Police!

1605
01:20:42,467 --> 01:20:44,335
Police! Freeze!

1606
01:20:44,403 --> 01:20:46,571
You're under ar...REST.

1607
01:20:47,806 --> 01:20:48,872
Hannah.

1608
01:20:52,277 --> 01:20:54,312
Bastard.

1609
01:20:54,379 --> 01:20:55,580
You bastard!

1610
01:20:55,647 --> 01:20:57,081
I had no idea!

1611
01:20:57,148 --> 01:20:59,584
For once in my life, I'm telling--

1612
01:20:59,651 --> 01:21:00,918
The deal is off!

1613
01:21:00,985 --> 01:21:02,253
I'm arresting you

1614
01:21:02,321 --> 01:21:03,754
for a scam moneymaking scheme

1615
01:21:03,822 --> 01:21:05,590
to build a little league park.

1616
01:21:05,657 --> 01:21:06,591
And furthermore,

1617
01:21:06,658 --> 01:21:09,694
I'm indicting you under your real name.

1618
01:21:09,761 --> 01:21:11,629
Cuff him!

1619
01:21:11,697 --> 01:21:14,699
He has to testify again in New York in 3 days,

1620
01:21:14,766 --> 01:21:16,200
but he not gonna make it now

1621
01:21:16,268 --> 01:21:17,602
because by tomorrow

1622
01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:19,270
this story's in the newspaper.

1623
01:21:19,338 --> 01:21:21,205
In 24 hours every hit man in America will be here.

1624
01:21:21,273 --> 01:21:22,707
I seriously doubt that.

1625
01:21:22,774 --> 01:21:24,208
You want to bet?

1626
01:21:24,276 --> 01:21:26,277
I never bet when I'm sure I'm right.

1627
01:21:26,345 --> 01:21:28,279
Presumably you haven't done much betting,

1628
01:21:28,347 --> 01:21:30,281
since you've only been wrong once in your life.

1629
01:21:30,349 --> 01:21:31,582
Twice.

1630
01:21:35,887 --> 01:21:37,255
Hannah.

1631
01:21:42,010 --> 01:21:43,444
There you are.

1632
01:21:43,512 --> 01:21:44,946
Barney! Thank God!

1633
01:21:45,013 --> 01:21:47,448
You got to get me out of this mess!

1634
01:21:47,516 --> 01:21:49,951
That's the way it's been your whole life.

1635
01:21:50,018 --> 01:21:51,452
You spill your milk,

1636
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,454
and somebody else gets to clean it up.

1637
01:21:53,522 --> 01:21:55,957
Well, I'm not cleaning up your mess this time.

1638
01:21:56,024 --> 01:21:56,958
Hey, Barney, lighten up.

1639
01:21:57,025 --> 01:21:58,459
Is that your solution,

1640
01:21:58,527 --> 01:21:59,961
that it's somebody else's problem?

1641
01:22:00,028 --> 01:22:01,462
You steal a little swordfish,

1642
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:02,964
and Hannah should lighten up?

1643
01:22:03,031 --> 01:22:05,967
You pretend to raise money for the little league,

1644
01:22:06,034 --> 01:22:07,969
and the whole community should lighten up?

1645
01:22:08,036 --> 01:22:09,470
Hannah turns against me,

1646
01:22:09,538 --> 01:22:10,972
And <i>I</i> should lighten up?

1647
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:12,974
Barney, I've upset you.

1648
01:22:13,041 --> 01:22:14,308
I'm sorry.

1649
01:22:14,376 --> 01:22:15,810
What kind of jail is this?

1650
01:22:15,878 --> 01:22:17,478
Oh, I don't like to use this bathroom,

1651
01:22:17,546 --> 01:22:19,981
so they let me use the office bathroom.

1652
01:22:20,048 --> 01:22:21,482
Isn't there a guard?

1653
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:22,984
Everything all right, Vinnie?

1654
01:22:23,051 --> 01:22:25,486
Oh, Jimmy, yeah. No problem. Thanks.

1655
01:22:25,554 --> 01:22:28,155
Come on in. Come on in.

1656
01:22:29,424 --> 01:22:30,691
Sit down.

1657
01:22:34,863 --> 01:22:36,296
You have a pillow

1658
01:22:36,364 --> 01:22:38,432
with your name embroidered on it?

1659
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,001
Yeah, Crystal made that for me.

1660
01:22:40,068 --> 01:22:41,602
It's nice, isn't it?

1661
01:22:48,076 --> 01:22:49,243
Hey...

1662
01:22:49,310 --> 01:22:51,746
at least you never got involved with her.

1663
01:22:51,813 --> 01:22:54,248
I can't believe I even suggested it!

1664
01:22:54,315 --> 01:22:55,750
Don't you understand, Vinnie?

1665
01:22:55,817 --> 01:22:57,251
I'm in love with Hannah.

1666
01:22:57,318 --> 01:23:00,354
And now she hates me, and it's all your fault.

1667
01:23:00,422 --> 01:23:01,856
I'm so pissed at you!

1668
01:23:01,924 --> 01:23:03,758
I'm really pissed, OK?

1669
01:23:03,825 --> 01:23:04,892
OK.

1670
01:23:06,795 --> 01:23:08,729
Why is it my fault?

1671
01:23:08,797 --> 01:23:11,231
Because you are a blight on this community,

1672
01:23:11,299 --> 01:23:14,902
and I put you here, so she blames me.

1673
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:19,907
Barney, I am sorry.

1674
01:23:19,975 --> 01:23:20,942
Yeah, right.

1675
01:23:21,009 --> 01:23:23,444
I am. Really, I am. I owe you.

1676
01:23:23,511 --> 01:23:24,946
You saved my life

1677
01:23:25,013 --> 01:23:26,881
that night in New York.

1678
01:23:26,949 --> 01:23:28,883
I could never shoot at anyone.

1679
01:23:28,951 --> 01:23:30,885
I never touched a gun in my life.

1680
01:23:30,953 --> 01:23:33,020
It doomed me forever to middle management,

1681
01:23:33,088 --> 01:23:35,923
and that's the truth.

1682
01:23:35,991 --> 01:23:38,926
I should do something. What could I do?

1683
01:23:38,994 --> 01:23:40,427
Vinnie, don't do anything.

1684
01:23:40,495 --> 01:23:42,697
Please, stop doing things.

1685
01:23:44,066 --> 01:23:46,500
I have to make a phone call.

1686
01:23:46,568 --> 01:23:47,635
Aw, Vinnie, now what?

1687
01:23:47,703 --> 01:23:49,904
I am entitled to make a phone call,

1688
01:23:49,972 --> 01:23:51,138
am I not?

1689
01:23:51,206 --> 01:23:52,539
Oh, jailer.

1690
01:23:53,942 --> 01:23:56,376
Should I use the office line

1691
01:23:56,444 --> 01:23:57,878
or the one in the coffee room.

1692
01:23:57,946 --> 01:23:59,447
Our position, your honor,

1693
01:23:59,514 --> 01:24:00,948
is that we be permitted

1694
01:24:01,015 --> 01:24:03,784
to hold Mr. Antonelli without bail.

1695
01:24:03,852 --> 01:24:06,286
Every day he is on the streets,

1696
01:24:06,354 --> 01:24:07,788
he commits a crime.

1697
01:24:07,856 --> 01:24:10,290
And while that may be all right

1698
01:24:10,358 --> 01:24:11,792
in places like New York

1699
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:13,794
where people are used to it,

1700
01:24:13,862 --> 01:24:16,296
here in Fryburg, every citizen is a victim.

1701
01:24:16,364 --> 01:24:17,297
Hear, hear!

1702
01:24:17,365 --> 01:24:18,298
That's right.

1703
01:24:21,102 --> 01:24:22,470
Mr. Coopersmith.

1704
01:24:22,537 --> 01:24:23,771
Your honor,

1705
01:24:23,839 --> 01:24:25,673
speaking for the Federal Bureau of Investigation,

1706
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:28,108
our position is that Mr. Antonelli

1707
01:24:28,176 --> 01:24:29,944
must not spend another night in jail.

1708
01:24:30,011 --> 01:24:31,612
His life is in danger.

1709
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:33,914
He must be protected so that he can testify

1710
01:24:33,982 --> 01:24:35,916
and therefore, we ask that you grant bail

1711
01:24:35,984 --> 01:24:37,952
and release him in our custody.

1712
01:24:38,019 --> 01:24:38,953
Your honor,

1713
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:41,689
this is exactly what the FBI does.

1714
01:24:41,756 --> 01:24:44,257
It pretends this man is in danger

1715
01:24:44,325 --> 01:24:46,760
when no one cares about him one bit.

1716
01:24:46,828 --> 01:24:48,261
There's all this melodrama,

1717
01:24:48,329 --> 01:24:51,765
as if cartoon hit men in white-on-white ties

1718
01:24:51,833 --> 01:24:55,435
are going to walk in and try to kill him.

1719
01:24:55,504 --> 01:24:57,437
Obviously, this is preposterous scenario,

1720
01:24:57,506 --> 01:24:59,439
the sort of paranoid fantasy that--

1721
01:24:59,508 --> 01:25:00,975
Duck!

1722
01:25:01,042 --> 01:25:02,843
Duck!

1723
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:06,279
Hannah!

1724
01:25:06,347 --> 01:25:08,348
Get down, get down!

1725
01:25:10,919 --> 01:25:12,386
You OK?

1726
01:25:14,422 --> 01:25:16,323
Move! Cover the stand!

1727
01:25:18,593 --> 01:25:21,629
I got to get out of here.

1728
01:25:24,232 --> 01:25:25,432
Follow me.

1729
01:25:31,339 --> 01:25:32,773
Get going, Coopersmith!

1730
01:25:32,841 --> 01:25:35,475
Vinnie! Ah, where is he? Vinnie!

1731
01:25:35,544 --> 01:25:36,977
It's all right, everybody!

1732
01:25:37,045 --> 01:25:38,311
They're gone! It's all right!

1733
01:25:38,379 --> 01:25:39,830
Use my car.

1734
01:25:39,898 --> 01:25:40,781
Great.

1735
01:25:40,849 --> 01:25:42,282
Oh, take my keys.

1736
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:43,283
Thanks.

1737
01:25:43,351 --> 01:25:44,784
Take my gun.

1738
01:25:44,852 --> 01:25:46,186
Wow.

1739
01:25:46,254 --> 01:25:47,687
You saved my life.

1740
01:25:47,755 --> 01:25:49,189
I'm in your debt forever.

1741
01:25:49,257 --> 01:25:50,824
That's how it works.

1742
01:26:01,302 --> 01:26:02,469
Take me!

1743
01:26:03,638 --> 01:26:04,704
Get in.

1744
01:26:07,708 --> 01:26:10,110
Just pretend I'm your hostage.

1745
01:26:33,968 --> 01:26:35,402
I can't believe it.

1746
01:26:35,470 --> 01:26:38,071
You're actually building this.

1747
01:26:39,374 --> 01:26:41,908
Yo, Vinnie! Yo, look at this!

1748
01:26:41,976 --> 01:26:44,712
Hey, Dino, Nicky, Benny!

1749
01:26:44,779 --> 01:26:47,748
Looking good! Looking good!

1750
01:27:03,748 --> 01:27:06,183
Oh, mom! Guess what he built.

1751
01:27:06,251 --> 01:27:08,686
I know. OK, hold on a sec.

1752
01:27:08,753 --> 01:27:10,187
It's so awesome.

1753
01:27:10,255 --> 01:27:12,189
Hannah, Hannah! Isn't he wonderful?

1754
01:27:12,257 --> 01:27:13,691
Why didn't you say anything

1755
01:27:13,758 --> 01:27:16,193
about this ball park when I arrested you?

1756
01:27:16,261 --> 01:27:18,195
What, and ruin the surprise?

1757
01:27:18,263 --> 01:27:20,698
You didn't say anything about this ball park

1758
01:27:20,765 --> 01:27:22,933
because there was nothing to say.

1759
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,337
You arranged all this from jail

1760
01:27:26,404 --> 01:27:29,106
to avoid prosecution for embezzlement.

1761
01:27:29,173 --> 01:27:31,208
Now that hurts.

1762
01:27:31,276 --> 01:27:33,143
Because this was my intention

1763
01:27:33,211 --> 01:27:34,712
from the very beginning.

1764
01:27:34,779 --> 01:27:36,813
The children needed a ball park,

1765
01:27:36,881 --> 01:27:38,649
and I responded.

1766
01:27:39,551 --> 01:27:40,718
See...

1767
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:45,789
I know how it feels to be disappointed.

1768
01:27:45,857 --> 01:27:48,792
When I was 7 years old-- no, 8--

1769
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:50,794
all I wanted for Christmas

1770
01:27:50,862 --> 01:27:53,096
Was a new red bicycle.

1771
01:27:53,164 --> 01:27:56,634
My favorite uncle, uncle Alfresco,

1772
01:27:56,701 --> 01:28:01,505
swore to me that he would buy me that bicycle.

1773
01:28:01,573 --> 01:28:05,542
I counted the days until Christmas.

1774
01:28:05,610 --> 01:28:07,344
5:00, Christmas morning,

1775
01:28:07,412 --> 01:28:08,845
I run down--

1776
01:28:08,913 --> 01:28:11,014
All right. Nobody move.

1777
01:28:11,983 --> 01:28:15,185
This is just between Vinnie and us.

1778
01:28:15,253 --> 01:28:18,122
Guys, I'm in the middle of an anecdote.

1779
01:28:18,189 --> 01:28:20,523
Come over here and nobody gets hurt.

1780
01:28:20,591 --> 01:28:21,658
OK, OK.

1781
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:23,643
Come on, kids, move back.

1782
01:28:23,712 --> 01:28:26,346
And everybody just get out of the way!

1783
01:28:26,414 --> 01:28:27,347
Take Vincent!

1784
01:28:27,415 --> 01:28:28,982
Go, Vinnie!

1785
01:28:29,050 --> 01:28:30,283
Aah!

1786
01:28:30,351 --> 01:28:31,785
All right, freeze!

1787
01:28:31,853 --> 01:28:33,520
Hold it right there!

1788
01:28:36,124 --> 01:28:37,057
Nice action.

1789
01:28:37,125 --> 01:28:38,058
Thanks.

1790
01:28:38,126 --> 01:28:39,059
I thought you didn't--

1791
01:28:39,127 --> 01:28:40,060
I lied.

1792
01:28:40,128 --> 01:28:42,562
Now, where was I? Oh, yes.

1793
01:28:42,630 --> 01:28:44,064
5:00, Christmas morning,

1794
01:28:44,132 --> 01:28:46,566
I run downstairs and look under the tree,

1795
01:28:46,634 --> 01:28:48,468
And what do I find?

1796
01:28:48,536 --> 01:28:52,239
Uncle Alfresco dead on the floor,

1797
01:28:52,306 --> 01:28:55,508
Shot through the back of the head.

1798
01:28:55,576 --> 01:28:57,878
Plus, no bicycle.

1799
01:28:57,946 --> 01:28:59,379
It was a disappointing Christmas

1800
01:28:59,447 --> 01:29:00,948
on many levels.

1801
01:29:01,015 --> 01:29:03,217
So you can accuse me of many things,

1802
01:29:03,284 --> 01:29:05,719
but never for one moment

1803
01:29:05,787 --> 01:29:09,623
did I intend to rip off these beautiful children.

1804
01:29:10,691 --> 01:29:12,826
Isn't that right, Barney?

1805
01:29:14,262 --> 01:29:17,231
Yeah. Vinnie told me about this little league thing

1806
01:29:17,298 --> 01:29:18,732
months ago.

1807
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,234
And the only reason

1808
01:29:20,301 --> 01:29:22,202
I didn't say anything about it

1809
01:29:22,270 --> 01:29:23,737
was 'cause

1810
01:29:23,805 --> 01:29:26,406
it was supposed to be a surprise for the kids.

1811
01:29:27,375 --> 01:29:30,477
Do you expect me to believe this?

1812
01:29:33,514 --> 01:29:36,016
Yes, I do.

1813
01:29:36,084 --> 01:29:37,651
How about it?

1814
01:29:42,356 --> 01:29:43,556
Nice.

1815
01:29:43,624 --> 01:29:45,558
Very nice.

1816
01:29:45,626 --> 01:29:46,793
Hey, hey!

1817
01:29:46,861 --> 01:29:49,112
Now, when you guys are laying this sod,

1818
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:50,630
remember, green side up.

1819
01:29:50,698 --> 01:29:51,798
Green side up.

1820
01:29:51,866 --> 01:29:52,783
OK.

1821
01:29:52,850 --> 01:29:55,301
Hey, Crystal, I want to show you this.

1822
01:29:55,369 --> 01:29:57,721
Now, what's gonna happen here...

1823
01:30:15,490 --> 01:30:17,591
Hey, peanuts!

1824
01:30:25,033 --> 01:30:27,101
Get ice-cold soda!

1825
01:30:27,168 --> 01:30:28,568
Hot dogs!

1826
01:30:28,636 --> 01:30:30,270
Car radios!

1827
01:30:30,338 --> 01:30:32,072
Peanuts! Peanuts!

1828
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:33,374
CDs!

1829
01:30:33,441 --> 01:30:34,875
Get your cannolis, zeppoli,

1830
01:30:34,942 --> 01:30:37,277
Veal cutlet hero!

1831
01:30:37,345 --> 01:30:40,830
Get the new best-seller, <i>how I got here--</i>

1832
01:30:40,898 --> 01:30:43,250
<i>adventures in a life</i> <i>of crime and punishment.</i>

1833
01:30:43,317 --> 01:30:44,752
Autographed by the criminal himself.

1834
01:30:44,819 --> 01:30:47,821
Hey, buddy, are you gonna read it or buy it?

1835
01:30:47,889 --> 01:30:50,824
I can't believe I'm back in this crummy town.

1836
01:30:50,892 --> 01:30:53,326
I must be working out some screwed-up karma.

1837
01:30:53,394 --> 01:30:54,327
I know what you mean.

1838
01:30:54,395 --> 01:30:55,829
Who would've thought

1839
01:30:55,897 --> 01:30:57,330
we'd each have two husbands in a row

1840
01:30:57,398 --> 01:30:59,833
who were in the federal witness program?

1841
01:30:59,901 --> 01:31:01,334
But you know, this lawn reminds--

1842
01:31:01,402 --> 01:31:02,335
Here, sweetie.

1843
01:31:02,403 --> 01:31:04,337
Let's have a good game.

1844
01:31:04,405 --> 01:31:05,739
Hey, umpire.

1845
01:31:05,807 --> 01:31:06,874
Yeah?

1846
01:31:09,477 --> 01:31:12,412
I got a little proposition to make you.

1847
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:14,447
The Fryburg Turtles...

1848
01:31:14,515 --> 01:31:16,684
They're going to win, hmm?

1849
01:31:16,751 --> 01:31:17,751
Hmm?

1850
01:31:17,819 --> 01:31:20,888
And now, Fryburg city council's

1851
01:31:20,955 --> 01:31:22,622
man of the year,

1852
01:31:22,691 --> 01:31:25,258
Mr. Vincent Antonelli,

1853
01:31:25,326 --> 01:31:27,928
will throw out the first ball.

1854

Whoa, look at these guys! Looking good! Whoa!

1859
01:32:03,631 --> 01:32:05,916
Huh? How about that, huh?

1860
01:32:08,186 --> 01:32:09,853
Whoa!

1861
01:32:09,921 --> 01:32:11,922
Merengue!

1862
01:32:11,989 --> 01:32:13,323
Oh!

1863
01:32:13,390 --> 01:32:15,325
My boy Vinnie!

1864
01:32:15,392 --> 01:32:17,160
Oh, good boy!

1865
01:32:17,228 --> 01:32:19,095
Hey, yeah!

1866
01:32:22,266 --> 01:32:24,234
Ooh! Ohh!

Hey, Crystal, how's our little one?

1871
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:41,084
Turtles all the way!

1872
01:32:41,152 --> 01:32:43,620
Play ball!

1873
01:32:45,823 --> 01:32:47,624
You know...

1874
01:32:47,692 --> 01:32:50,460
Sometimes I even amaze myself.
