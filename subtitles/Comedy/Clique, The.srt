1
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,158
Oh, my God.

2
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:21,594
You are single-handedly ruining my life.

3
00:01:21,595 --> 00:01:23,262
You have to be kidding me.

4
00:01:23,263 --> 00:01:25,865
- We're serious about this, Massie.
- So am I.

5
00:01:25,866 --> 00:01:27,507
I already
made plans.

6
00:01:27,534 --> 00:01:29,768
This party isn't just a party.

7
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:32,071
It's the last party
before winter break's over.

8
00:01:32,072 --> 00:01:35,441
Forget being the event of the season,
it's the event of all four.

9
00:01:35,442 --> 00:01:37,509
The Lyons are gonna be here for dinner.

10
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,711
The Lyons?

11
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:41,380
Are the tigers and bears coming too?
Oh, my.

12
00:01:41,381 --> 00:01:43,949
Massie, we talked about this weeks ago.

13
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,442
You remember Jay?
My best friend from business school?

14
00:01:48,154 --> 00:01:51,054
He's moving up here from Florida
with his family.

15
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:55,094
They have a son, Todd,
a daughter, Claire. She's your age?

16
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:57,997
They'll stay out in the guesthouse
until they find a place.

17
00:01:57,998 --> 00:02:01,000
Does any of this
even ring the smallest of bells?

18
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:03,168
Uh, no.

19
00:02:03,169 --> 00:02:06,505
- You'll be at dinner and you'll be pleasant.
- Mom.

20
00:02:06,506 --> 00:02:09,341
You always said I should honor
my commitments, right?

21
00:02:09,342 --> 00:02:11,911
Well, I made a verbal commitment
to Shelby Rexler...

22
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:14,647
...that I would be at her party tonight.

23
00:02:14,648 --> 00:02:16,548
I'm not discussing this anymore.

24
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:18,951
- Dad.
- You heard your mother.

25
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:22,655
Mom, if I miss this,
it'd be starting the second semester...

26
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:24,690
...on the completely wrong foot.

27
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:29,495
Worse than the wrong foot.
It'd be like wearing the wrong outfit.

28
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:35,893
Bean, tell me this isn't happening.

29
00:02:35,902 --> 00:02:38,103
This is my worst nightmare.

30
00:02:38,104 --> 00:02:40,739
Worse than the one
where my Amex was rejected.

31
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,674
Worse than the one
where I lost my Prada bag.

32
00:02:43,944 --> 00:02:46,241
And look.

33
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,579
I already had my outfit picked out
and everything.

34
00:02:51,885 --> 00:02:56,378
If I have to miss this,
everyone has to miss this.

35
00:03:01,127 --> 00:03:02,361
Hey.

36
00:03:02,362 --> 00:03:04,463
Put the brush down.
I'm getting Dylan.

37
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:09,935
I was just about to call you.
I'm in a wardrobe crisis.

38
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:12,671
- Hey, Dyl.
- Hey, Alicia. Ow!

39
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:14,606
- I'll get Kristen.
- She's school shopping.

40
00:03:14,607 --> 00:03:16,542
She's already called me three times...

41
00:03:16,543 --> 00:03:18,911
...to ask if we need
a compass and a protractor.

42
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,980
- What did you tell her?
- To get a life.

43
00:03:22,148 --> 00:03:25,851
Mass, look, I can't talk right now.
Did you get a compass and a protractor?

44
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:27,786
Who cares?
P.S. Leesh and Dyl on the line.

45
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:28,988
- Hey, girlies.
- Hi.

46
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:30,856
- Hey.
- Okay.

47
00:03:30,857 --> 00:03:35,928
So, what I'm about to tell you
is gonna score me major gossip points.

48
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:41,467
Like Shelby Rexler did not chop her hair off
to look more like Keira Knightley.

49
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:44,336
- She has head lice.
- Ew! Gross.

50
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:46,305
I know. I say we bag the party.

51
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:49,575
There's no way I'm trading
my Frédéric Fekkai for Nix.

52
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:52,811
But it's an 8th-grade party
and we're the only 7th graders invited.

53
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:54,813
Please, I'm not gonna be caught dead...

54
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:57,649
...at a party thrown by anyone
under the age of 15.

55
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,785
It's worse than wearing Crocs.

56
00:03:59,786 --> 00:04:03,956
- Wait, head lice and Crocs?
- No one's actually wearing Crocs, Dyl.

57
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:07,493
Actually, I think Shelby has a pair
in orange.

58
00:04:07,494 --> 00:04:08,794
Ew!

59
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:10,629
- Forget it, I'm out.
- Me too.

60
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,631
Me three.

61
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:15,191
That's what I thought.

62
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:25,677
Mass, the Lyons will be here soon.
You might wanna change.

63
00:04:25,678 --> 00:04:28,147
Can I change the fact
that they're gonna be here?

64
00:04:28,148 --> 00:04:29,948
Look, I'll make a deal with you.

65
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:32,584
If you adjust your attitude,
be nice to Claire...

66
00:04:32,585 --> 00:04:36,355
- Who's Claire?
- The Lyons' daughter.

67
00:04:36,356 --> 00:04:40,292
Be nice to her and I'll let you go
to the end of Shelby's party.

68
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:43,295
Oh, my God.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

69
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:46,356
MRS. BLOCK:
Now, go get changed.

70
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:53,195
MASSIE:
Bean.

71
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:56,340
Bean, chill.

72
00:05:18,064 --> 00:05:21,100
Dad, how many people live here?

73
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:23,228
Is this really our new house?

74
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,371
Bean, what's one step worse
than a fashion don't?

75
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:39,618
A fashion don't-even-think-about-it.

76
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:40,919
WILLIAM:
They're here.

77
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,855
I'm not even ready yet.

78
00:05:42,856 --> 00:05:44,389
- Hey.
- Hey.

79
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:48,060
Oh, look. Hey.

80
00:05:48,061 --> 00:05:49,261
You made it.

81
00:05:49,262 --> 00:05:51,029
WILLIAM:
Good to see you.

82
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,964
- How are you, buddy?
- Oh, you got so big.

83
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,537
What do you think, Bean?

84
00:06:03,076 --> 00:06:05,339
Perfect, right?

85
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:10,246
Oh, so good to see you.

86
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:15,416
There she is, perfect timing.

87
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:19,386
- This is our daughter, Massie.
- Hi, my parents told me all about you.

88
00:06:19,726 --> 00:06:21,750
Mine barely mentioned you.

89
00:06:22,962 --> 00:06:25,487
Except to say how fun and cool you are.

90
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:32,137
Uh, hello?
She's a dog, not a baseball glove.

91
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,009
TODD:
Hey, come here.

92
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,774
Sorry, he must have forgotten
to take his meds.

93
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:41,480
Meds?

94
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:44,313
That was a joke.

95
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:47,643
Funny.

96
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:51,521
WILLIAM: Good to see you.
JAY: It's good to see you.

97
00:06:54,827 --> 00:06:57,659
MRS. BLOCK:
This is delicious.

98
00:07:04,537 --> 00:07:07,267
Claire helped pick that out.

99
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:11,802
Sorry.

100
00:07:15,215 --> 00:07:16,815
It's for your charm bracelet.

101
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:19,648
Really?
I never would've guessed, thanks.

102
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:24,890
I remember your mom wrote
in a Christmas card one year...

103
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:27,059
...that you wanted to be a singer?

104
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,993
Right, when I was 7.

105
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:36,001
Um. Thanks.

106
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:38,704
So, Claire,
I hear you're a straight-A student.

107
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:41,240
She was in the top three
in her science fair.

108
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:44,443
And she won the district
spelling bee contest last year.

109
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:46,178
Wow.

110
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:47,746
WILLIAM:
That's very impressive, Claire.

111
00:07:47,747 --> 00:07:50,382
Why don't you tell Claire
about Octavian Country Day?

112
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:52,451
Massie just loves OCD.

113
00:07:52,452 --> 00:07:54,419
- Right, Massie?
- Oh, right.

114
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,190
Um, small classes,
nice teachers for the most part.

115
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:00,559
There's only one problem. No boys.

116
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,361
Who says that's a problem?

117
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:04,352
The girls who go there, Dad.

118
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,131
- Mr. Lyons, let me get that for you.
- Sure.

119
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:17,709
You complete me.

120
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,110
Ew.

121
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:23,007
MRS. BLOCK:
Excuse me.

122
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:30,555
- They were still eating.
- Please.

123
00:08:30,556 --> 00:08:33,558
- You promised I could go to the party.
- A party?

124
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,795
Thanks, Claire.
Maybe Claire would like to go with you.

125
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:39,730
Oh, I'm up for, you know...

126
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:42,594
Whatever.

127
00:08:44,437 --> 00:08:46,705
Sweetie, are you okay?

128
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:48,073
Um...

129
00:08:48,074 --> 00:08:50,976
You know what?
I think I'm gonna go to bed.

130
00:08:50,977 --> 00:08:52,774
I don't feel so well.

131
00:08:55,415 --> 00:08:57,549
Night, Massie.
I hope it's nothing serious.

132
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,619
Get some sleep, honey.
I'm sure it'll be gone in the morning.

133
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,888
I seriously hope so.

134
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:05,390
CLAIRE: Did you see her clothes
and her shoes and her hair?

135
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:08,126
I swear,
she looked straight out of a magazine.

136
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:09,328
She is pretty cute.

137
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:11,730
Could we go shopping
for the first day of school?

138
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:14,566
What about the clothes we bought
before we left Florida?

139
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:18,935
T.J. Maxx isn't gonna cut it here, Mom.
It's, like, designer everything.

140
00:09:19,806 --> 00:09:22,441
Please? I just wanna fit in.

141
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:24,009
I really want her to like me.

142
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,741
She's gonna like you because you're you,
not because of what you wear.

143
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:31,917
All right, fine.

144
00:09:31,918 --> 00:09:34,086
I suppose we could use
a new sweater or two.

145
00:09:34,087 --> 00:09:35,721
It is pretty cold up here.

146
00:09:35,722 --> 00:09:39,055
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

147
00:09:51,003 --> 00:09:52,771
CHRIS:
On your right.

148
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:56,207
Hey, watch where you're going.

149
00:10:01,581 --> 00:10:04,549
Hey, isn't there a law
against texting and riding?

150
00:10:06,786 --> 00:10:08,687
- I'm Chris Abeley.
- I'm...

151
00:10:08,688 --> 00:10:10,422
Massie Block. I know who you are.

152
00:10:10,423 --> 00:10:11,623
- Really?
- Sure.

153
00:10:11,624 --> 00:10:15,193
I used to come to your parents'
charity auction practically every year.

154
00:10:15,194 --> 00:10:18,663
- I wonder why we've never met.
- I've been MIA the past couple of years.

155
00:10:18,664 --> 00:10:21,266
- In a boarding school in Connecticut.
- Sounds cliché.

156
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:23,034
Yeah, so is getting kicked out.

157
00:10:23,035 --> 00:10:25,036
I'm back at Briarwood for high school.

158
00:10:25,037 --> 00:10:26,238
A bad boy, huh?

159
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:28,974
I guess that explains
why you're on a private trail.

160
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:32,069
Yeah, I must have made
a wrong turn somewhere.

161
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:34,211
Or the right one.

162
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:37,549
I should go.
I'll let you have your trail back.

163
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,419
Oh, no, it's okay.
I love having guests, really.

164
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,156
Maybe I'll see you back here.
I was thinking of riding again on Saturday.

165
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:46,825
Sure. Maybe you'd wanna ride together?

166
00:10:46,826 --> 00:10:48,759
Sure, it's a date.

167
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,571
Did you hear that, Brownie? It's a date.

168
00:11:07,914 --> 00:11:09,848
JUDI: What about this?
- Mom.

169
00:11:09,849 --> 00:11:13,051
"At OCD, fashion is a fine art
and true form of self-expression. "

170
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:15,417
Okay, okay.

171
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:20,151
These are perfect.

172
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,285
Those are nice. Let's see.

173
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:27,199
Ooh, 62 dollars.

174
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,930
"Excellence isn't encouraged,
it's expected. "

175
00:11:30,002 --> 00:11:32,304
- Expected, Mom.
- I'm sorry, honey.

176
00:11:32,305 --> 00:11:35,173
With the move and everything,
this is just too expensive.

177
00:11:35,174 --> 00:11:37,608
CLAIRE:
Well, can I just look next door?

178
00:11:37,944 --> 00:11:41,277
I'm not gonna buy anything,
I just wanna look for ideas.

179
00:11:43,282 --> 00:11:46,384
All right, fine, five minutes.
But then we're going to Old Navy.

180
00:11:46,385 --> 00:11:49,479
- They have a sale on turtlenecks...
- Okay, thanks, Mom.

181
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:22,120
DYLAN:
But they look great.

182
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:25,257
- Well, I'm not getting you a size six.
- But I am a size six.

183
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:29,160
Well, when you're a size four again,
I'll get you the pants.

184
00:12:29,161 --> 00:12:31,629
In every color.

185
00:12:36,302 --> 00:12:39,170
- Moms, they just don't get it.
- Right?

186
00:12:39,171 --> 00:12:41,332
Weren't they kids once too?

187
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:45,143
I don't think they have a four
in this whole store.

188
00:12:45,144 --> 00:12:48,704
What about these? These are fours.

189
00:12:51,384 --> 00:12:55,115
If I try and fit into these,
I won't be able to breathe.

190
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:58,356
Why don't you switch the tags?

191
00:12:58,357 --> 00:13:01,459
Then, your mom thinks you're buying
a four when you're buying a six.

192
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,121
Then your mom's happy
and you can exhale.

193
00:13:05,164 --> 00:13:06,665
You're brilliant.

194
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,827
- I'm Dylan.
- Claire.

195
00:13:09,502 --> 00:13:12,203
- We walked in on some dude.
- Trying on women's clothes.

196
00:13:12,204 --> 00:13:14,005
- No.
- Come on.

197
00:13:14,006 --> 00:13:18,135
Oh, nice meeting you, Claire.
And thanks.

198
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:30,146
Since excellence is expected.

199
00:13:36,395 --> 00:13:39,762
CLAIRE:
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

200
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:52,501
"Good girls go to Orlando.
Bad girls go to Miami. "

201
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:55,675
Where do ugly girls like you go?

202
00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:01,016
Claire, Mrs. Block said
that you can go to school with Massie.

203
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:05,615
You should meet the driver
in front of the house at 7:30.

204
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:11,522
Their driver's going to
take me to school?

205
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,201
ISAAC:
You must be Claire.

206
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:18,329
CLAIRE:
Hi, Isaac.

207
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:20,731
Thanks.

208
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:32,778
Wow.

209
00:14:35,154 --> 00:14:38,189
God, Claire, you scared me.

210
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,458
You shouldn't sneak up on people
like that.

211
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:41,993
Sorry.

212
00:14:41,994 --> 00:14:43,595
Oh, it's fine.

213
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:46,665
Do you mind sitting in the back?
We have to pick up a few more.

214
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,134
Oh, sure.

215
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:10,155
Relax, Claire. This isn't Epcot.

216
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:13,989
I swear, celebs are getting more DUIs
than Ksubi jeans.

217
00:15:14,093 --> 00:15:19,264
Hm. Moschino dress, Alice and Olivia
jacket, Michael Kors handbag.

218
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:21,599
Adorable, 8.5.

219
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,000
Thank you.

220
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:31,810
- Wait.
- Dylan?

221
00:15:31,811 --> 00:15:33,378
Claire, right?

222
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:35,980
- You two know each other?
- From the mall.

223
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:38,283
Claire had that brilliant idea
about the pants.

224
00:15:38,284 --> 00:15:40,652
When my mom was being a jerk
to the 10th degree.

225
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:44,089
And then Dylan's friends came out
and started screaming about some guy.

226
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,724
Yeah, those are my friends too.

227
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:50,161
And FYI, that story's more last week
than white skinny jeans.

228
00:15:50,162 --> 00:15:53,098
Claire's the girl I told you about.

229
00:15:53,099 --> 00:15:54,899
The one living in my guesthouse...

230
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,836
...because her parents
can't afford anything else right now.

231
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:02,507
Gummi Feet?

232
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:07,001
- Thanks, but I don't eat sugar.
- And I don't eat feet.

233
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:25,130
<i>- Hey.
- What's up, chica?</i>

234
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:28,767
Hey, girl.
Vintage Ralph Lauren, 9.

235
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:31,569
Well, you're a 10. You look amazing.

236
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,405
- Just wait till tomorrow.
- Why?

237
00:16:34,406 --> 00:16:39,240
Because you get better-looking
every day.

238
00:16:42,948 --> 00:16:44,516
Hey, guys.

239
00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:48,578
Somebody call the fashion police.
I'm making a citizen's arrest.

240
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,289
Finally.

241
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,191
MASSIE: Seriously, Kris, when is your mom
gonna let you wear what you want?

242
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:27,392
My question first.

243
00:17:27,393 --> 00:17:30,895
One, why does it smell
like first-class airline food?

244
00:17:30,896 --> 00:17:34,661
I started the Circle diet today. Sorry.

245
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:38,168
And two, who's the stowaway?

246
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:41,631
Oh, my God.
Has she been there the whole time?

247
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:44,072
That's Claire.

248
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,734
Do we like her?

249
00:17:45,778 --> 00:17:47,802
No.

250
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:09,260
CLAIRE:
Isaac?

251
00:18:09,802 --> 00:18:13,037
ISAAC:
Claire, sorry.

252
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:15,335
CLAIRE:
Thanks.

253
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,638
Hey, Mass.
We missed you guys Saturday night.

254
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:49,841
The party was completely unbloggable
without you.

255
00:18:49,842 --> 00:18:51,042
I know.

256
00:18:51,043 --> 00:18:54,512
We heard
you had some unexpected visitors.

257
00:18:55,347 --> 00:18:58,873
Oh, my God, Jenna Dressler's
wearing her Chihuahua shirt again.

258
00:18:59,184 --> 00:19:01,286
Hey, you guys.
How was your winter break?

259
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:04,355
Massie, I heard you have an NBF
from Florida.

260
00:19:04,356 --> 00:19:08,226
False. If I had a new best friend,
she'd be here right now.

261
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:11,491
- She is so off my top eight.
- She was in your top eight?

262
00:19:16,335 --> 00:19:17,635
Ow!

263
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:20,638
Juicy Couture sweat suit.
No punch backs.

264
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:23,608
Wait, I lost an earring.

265
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:26,475
Nobody move!

266
00:19:26,645 --> 00:19:30,308
I need to retrace. Fan out, people.

267
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:42,917
GIRL:
Hey, look out.

268
00:19:44,363 --> 00:19:46,197
CHRIS:
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

269
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:48,199
Are you okay?

270
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,500
I'm so sorry.

271
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:51,059
I was rushing.

272
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:54,639
My sister, she forgot her thermos
so I had to run all the way back here.

273
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,835
And I didn't even...

274
00:19:57,576 --> 00:19:59,475
Are you sure you're okay?

275
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:01,810
I'm sure.

276
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:03,681
I'm Chris Abeley.

277
00:20:03,682 --> 00:20:06,912
I'm Claire Something.

278
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:09,918
Nice to meet you, Claire Something.

279
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:23,634
- What are you doing?
- Uh, anger management much?

280
00:20:23,635 --> 00:20:26,304
Hello! I can't wear one earring.
I'll look like Johnny Depp.

281
00:20:26,305 --> 00:20:28,039
- But wasn't that a diamond?
- Ugh!

282
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,237
Hey. Uh...
Do you guys know where Room 41 is?

283
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:37,181
Yeah, um, turn around
and go out these double doors.

284
00:20:37,182 --> 00:20:38,383
Take a cab to JFK...

285
00:20:38,384 --> 00:20:41,486
...and get on the next flight
to wherever you came from.

286
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:43,855
Latte, anyone?

287
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:45,490
I don't get it. What's going on?

288
00:20:45,491 --> 00:20:48,493
Claire, did I invite you to my BBQ?

289
00:20:48,494 --> 00:20:52,363
- Um. No.
- Then why are you all up in my grill?

290
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:57,535
I don't get it.
Why are you being like this?

291
00:20:57,536 --> 00:21:00,766
Like what, Claire? What am I being like?

292
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:02,938
Like...

293
00:21:03,175 --> 00:21:05,643
I don't know, a bitch?

294
00:21:08,213 --> 00:21:09,941
What did you just call me?

295
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:13,012
Nothing. I mean...

296
00:21:13,318 --> 00:21:15,308
Nothing.

297
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,596
- I can't believe she just said that.
- She called you a bitch to your face.

298
00:21:25,597 --> 00:21:28,166
- Mass, what are you gonna do to her?
- I don't know.

299
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:31,736
All I know is that Claire Lyons
should consider herself done, done...

300
00:21:31,737 --> 00:21:33,071
...and you know else?

301
00:21:33,072 --> 00:21:35,039
ALL:
Done.

302
00:21:51,523 --> 00:21:54,225
Do you need a personal invitation
to come in?

303
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:57,028
Give me your e-mail,
I'll send you an Evite.

304
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:59,163
Sorry I'm late. I got a little lost.

305
00:21:59,164 --> 00:22:00,965
And you are?

306
00:22:00,966 --> 00:22:03,734
- I'm Claire, I'm new.
- I'm Vincent, I'm old.

307
00:22:03,735 --> 00:22:07,102
But you know what they say,
32 is the new 22.

308
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:09,674
My likes include Broadway musicals...

309
00:22:09,675 --> 00:22:12,439
...piña coladas
and taking long walks in the rain.

310
00:22:12,511 --> 00:22:15,313
And my dislikes are...
Now, what were they again?

311
00:22:15,314 --> 00:22:18,442
Oh, yeah, tardiness.

312
00:22:19,418 --> 00:22:21,786
There's a seat by the window.

313
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:24,722
And Miss Rivera,
this isn't the changing room at Saks.

314
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:26,918
Make room.

315
00:22:26,925 --> 00:22:29,293
Claire, I've seen paint dry faster.

316
00:22:29,294 --> 00:22:31,796
Chop, chop. Chop squared, please.

317
00:22:31,797 --> 00:22:34,065
Okay, you have your materials
in front of you.

318
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:39,128
You have 15 minutes
to paint this as still life.

319
00:22:50,582 --> 00:22:53,284
I think I'm gonna use some of that too.

320
00:22:54,486 --> 00:22:58,089
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Is there a problem, ladies?

321
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,614
- No.
- No.

322
00:23:25,584 --> 00:23:28,419
Do you think I could start over?
I'm not good at this yet.

323
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,289
Commit to your work, Miss Lyons.
This is a lesson for life.

324
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:34,384
Once you start something,
you need to stick with it.

325
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:38,796
Oh, my God. Miss Lyons.

326
00:23:38,797 --> 00:23:42,133
Here's a pass to the nurse.

327
00:23:42,134 --> 00:23:43,968
And take your books with you.

328
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:46,164
- I feel fine.
- Just go.

329
00:24:36,121 --> 00:24:38,556
Hey, Claire. You look a little lost.

330
00:24:38,557 --> 00:24:41,492
- I'm supposed to go to the nurse's office.
- Easy.

331
00:24:41,493 --> 00:24:44,729
Follow this hall all the way down,
past the main office and gym.

332
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,832
Take a right at the band room.
It's the first door on the right.

333
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:51,435
Be sure to be loud when you go in.
Nurse Adele's a little hard of hearing.

334
00:24:51,436 --> 00:24:54,871
- Thanks, Dylan, I really appreciate it.
- My pleasure.

335
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:09,387
Breathe into your power house.

336
00:25:09,388 --> 00:25:11,622
In...

337
00:25:11,623 --> 00:25:14,751
...and out.

338
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,426
Nurse Adele?

339
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:22,366
WOMAN: Nurse Adele's office
is on the other side of the school...

340
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:24,135
...by the art wing.

341
00:25:24,136 --> 00:25:25,728
But I was just there.

342
00:25:30,976 --> 00:25:32,966
WOMAN:
Ladies.

343
00:25:40,118 --> 00:25:42,745
Re-center.

344
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:48,154
Can I help you with something, dear?

345
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:52,496
Um. I don't know.
I'm not really sure why I'm here.

346
00:25:52,497 --> 00:25:54,862
Vincent told me to come.

347
00:25:57,002 --> 00:26:00,164
Don't worry. Got your period.

348
00:26:00,205 --> 00:26:02,434
No, I didn't. What?

349
00:26:03,008 --> 00:26:05,840
Look at the back of your jeans.

350
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,849
How is this possible?

351
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,477
- I don't...
- Be right back.

352
00:26:22,227 --> 00:26:25,763
Alicia, red paint.

353
00:26:25,764 --> 00:26:29,166
Don't worry, dear.
This is also the lost and found.

354
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:31,669
Go through
and pick out something you like.

355
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,270
- Really?
- Really.

356
00:26:33,271 --> 00:26:34,472
Whatever you want.

357
00:26:34,473 --> 00:26:38,534
These girls want nothing to do
with last season's clothes, trust me.

358
00:27:13,645 --> 00:27:15,510
Hey, cool top.

359
00:27:15,614 --> 00:27:18,173
I had the same one but I lost it.

360
00:27:20,485 --> 00:27:23,954
Looks like someone went shopping
at Nursestrom's today.

361
00:27:23,955 --> 00:27:26,924
Seven's so three years ago.

362
00:27:26,925 --> 00:27:33,489
<i>Loser, loser, double loser, whatever,
as if, get the picture, duh.</i>

363
00:27:36,535 --> 00:27:39,603
- Ow! What the...?
- Juicy hoodie, no punch backs.

364
00:27:39,604 --> 00:27:41,839
Now, lean in. I've got major gossip.

365
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,341
- How many points is it worth?
- None, it's about me.

366
00:27:44,342 --> 00:27:47,003
Why didn't you tell us in the car?

367
00:27:48,847 --> 00:27:51,615
- There is a reason I was MIA yesterday.
- MIA?

368
00:27:51,616 --> 00:27:55,586
Missing in Armani?
I was being asked out on a date.

369
00:27:55,587 --> 00:27:57,855
- By a boy?
- As opposed to who?

370
00:27:57,856 --> 00:28:00,691
- Yes, a boy, a Briarwood boy.
- No.

371
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:03,761
- Yes, he's a freshman in high school.
- Shut up.

372
00:28:03,762 --> 00:28:05,062
His name's Chris Abeley.

373
00:28:05,063 --> 00:28:07,531
We have to do some major recon
after school today.

374
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:09,800
No, I don't know.
I have a ton of homework.

375
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:14,071
You cannot be stressed out about school.
It's only the first day after winter break.

376
00:28:14,072 --> 00:28:16,907
I have to come up with
the Women in the Workforce project.

377
00:28:16,908 --> 00:28:19,376
I have to have a business plan
and a budget.

378
00:28:19,377 --> 00:28:21,479
It's worth, like, 60 percent of my grade.

379
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,438
Does anyone wanna trade
for something edible?

380
00:28:25,617 --> 00:28:27,778
Ask her.

381
00:28:30,188 --> 00:28:32,490
You guys, I feel bad.

382
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:34,982
Maybe we could pull up a chair?

383
00:28:37,963 --> 00:28:41,125
That was Clairious.

384
00:28:55,247 --> 00:28:58,616
MASSIE: Okay, so I called Isaac to meet us
here at Briarwood at 4:30.

385
00:28:58,617 --> 00:29:01,085
- So we have to hurry.
ALICIA: Tell that to Chris Abeley.

386
00:29:01,086 --> 00:29:03,521
By the way, micro-mini?
So not good for spying.

387
00:29:03,522 --> 00:29:05,890
Quiet.
Hey, what happened to the diet?

388
00:29:05,891 --> 00:29:08,158
I'm starving.
It's either this or my left arm.

389
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,360
It's 4:15.

390
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:12,096
- Chris Abeley will be here, don't worry.
- Who's worried?

391
00:29:12,097 --> 00:29:15,399
Hear about the New York City field trip
to the Museum of Modern Art?

392
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,494
Vincent's taking
the whole seventh grade.

393
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:21,372
It's Chris Abeley.

394
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:23,568
There's Chris Abeley.

395
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:26,277
I want to, but I don't know.

396
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:27,478
Oh...

397
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:29,469
- My...
- God.

398
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:34,817
MASSIE:
Look at him, look at him, look at him.

399
00:29:38,957 --> 00:29:42,159
He's coming this way.
Chris Abeley is coming this way.

400
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,685
ALICIA:
Get down.

401
00:29:45,163 --> 00:29:47,865
BOY: I got at least three or four hours
of homework tonight.

402
00:29:47,866 --> 00:29:50,534
- Really? You do?
BOY: Yeah, it's not even funny.

403
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,099
ALICIA:
Shh!

404
00:30:03,014 --> 00:30:06,039
DYLAN: Oh, my God.
ALICIA: Yeah.

405
00:30:14,726 --> 00:30:17,494
JUDI:
Hey, how was your first day?

406
00:30:17,495 --> 00:30:19,257
CLAIRE:
Good.

407
00:30:23,468 --> 00:30:26,503
- Hey, whose clothes are those?
- Oh.

408
00:30:26,504 --> 00:30:28,472
Massie's. You know Massie.

409
00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:31,675
She keeps, like, three changes
of backup clothes in her locker.

410
00:30:31,676 --> 00:30:34,542
She wanted me to be dressed
more like her.

411
00:30:34,946 --> 00:30:36,914
Oh.

412
00:30:36,915 --> 00:30:39,950
Well, maybe we should return
your new jeans, then, huh?

413
00:30:39,951 --> 00:30:42,019
You can't.

414
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:46,256
I spilled paint all over them in art class.
I'm sorry, Mom, I know you spent a lot.

415
00:30:46,257 --> 00:30:48,225
Oh, no, come on, honey, that's okay.

416
00:30:48,226 --> 00:30:50,956
I mean, it's just pants.
It's no big deal.

417
00:30:51,863 --> 00:30:54,558
I'm just glad you and Massie
are hitting it off.

418
00:30:55,266 --> 00:30:56,767
<i>MASSIE:
I hate her.</i>

419
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,369
Claire.

420
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:02,339
She sits there like this perfect,
wide-eyed, innocent goody two-shoes.

421
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,708
Meanwhile,
she's trying to be BFFs with Dylan...

422
00:31:04,709 --> 00:31:07,211
...and she's throwing herself
at Chris Abeley behind my back.

423
00:31:07,212 --> 00:31:11,448
You can't just drive into someone else's
town and live in someone else's house...

424
00:31:11,449 --> 00:31:14,440
...and try to take over
someone else's friends, right?

425
00:31:21,326 --> 00:31:22,526
I mean, what's next?

426
00:31:22,527 --> 00:31:26,929
She's gonna change her last name to Block
and move into my bedroom?

427
00:31:29,534 --> 00:31:31,935
I may live on 4.6 acres of property...

428
00:31:31,936 --> 00:31:35,496
...but there is no way
that it's big enough for me and...

429
00:31:42,981 --> 00:31:45,749
Can't believe your lips are still red
from those cherries.

430
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,152
I know. Aren't they luscious?

431
00:31:48,153 --> 00:31:52,022
Whatev.
I just wish my lip gloss lasted that long.

432
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:55,492
Actually, if you could sell that,
you could make a fortune.

433
00:31:55,493 --> 00:32:00,930
Lipstick that lasts 24 hours.
You can even wake up pretty.

434
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:05,035
Oh, my God, that's it, Massie.
That's what I can do for my project.

435
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:07,504
A makeup company.
You guys could help me.

436
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:10,274
- Hey, yeah.
- Oh, my God, I'm so smart.

437
00:32:10,275 --> 00:32:11,975
That really is a good idea.

438
00:32:11,976 --> 00:32:14,478
Conversation
between the taco and burrito, nacho.

439
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:17,281
Anyways, we could make
everything ourselves, all natural.

440
00:32:17,282 --> 00:32:20,317
And edible. When you get bored of a color,
you could eat it.

441
00:32:20,318 --> 00:32:21,518
I heart that.

442
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,455
We could sell it on that field trip
to New York on Saturday.

443
00:32:24,456 --> 00:32:28,289
- The whole class will be there.
- You guys, we need a great name.

444
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,760
What about Homeworks?

445
00:32:29,761 --> 00:32:32,096
Because we make it at home.

446
00:32:32,097 --> 00:32:34,326
And it works.

447
00:32:34,365 --> 00:32:35,733
Homeworks?

448
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:40,728
That makes us sound like losers who don't
have any friends and never go out, like:

449
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:47,171
What about Glambition?

450
00:32:50,849 --> 00:32:53,484
It'll do until I think of something better.

451
00:32:53,485 --> 00:32:55,486
Oh, my God. We're gonna be so rich.

452
00:32:55,487 --> 00:32:58,188
Oh, please. We already are.

453
00:32:58,189 --> 00:33:00,884
- To Glambition.
- To Glambition.

454
00:33:14,105 --> 00:33:16,173
FYI, Claire.

455
00:33:16,174 --> 00:33:18,809
There are more girls than those girls
in this school.

456
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,334
Go find them.

457
00:33:36,494 --> 00:33:38,928
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

458
00:33:49,307 --> 00:33:50,967
Is that real?

459
00:33:51,142 --> 00:33:53,277
I got this at CVS for a buck 20.

460
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:54,678
Oh, well, you never know.

461
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:57,815
For all I know,
those Picassos on the wall could be real.

462
00:33:57,816 --> 00:33:59,840
They are.

463
00:34:01,753 --> 00:34:03,420
I'm Layne.

464
00:34:03,421 --> 00:34:04,621
Claire, right?

465
00:34:04,622 --> 00:34:06,723
Yeah, you're new around here.
Word travels fast.

466
00:34:06,724 --> 00:34:08,759
Oh. Oatmeal?

467
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,057
No, thanks. I'm trying to cut back.

468
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:17,501
One day here and you're already dressed
like a pure Massie-chist.

469
00:34:17,502 --> 00:34:19,629
You guys friends?

470
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:23,440
Um...

471
00:34:23,441 --> 00:34:25,272
Yeah, we kind of are.

472
00:34:26,177 --> 00:34:30,443
I didn't realize the Pretty Committee
was taking applications for new members.

473
00:34:33,685 --> 00:34:35,285
Hey, cool bag.

474
00:34:35,286 --> 00:34:37,845
It's a stereo. Fifty bucks, Spencer Gifts.

475
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:52,492
- Oh, my God. That is so gross.
- What is she doing?

476
00:35:04,015 --> 00:35:06,450
Are you sure it's okay for you
to be sitting here?

477
00:35:06,451 --> 00:35:09,052
Massie looks pissed.

478
00:35:09,053 --> 00:35:12,317
She's fine. I told her, you know...

479
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:15,120
...I can't hang out with only her
all the time.

480
00:35:19,764 --> 00:35:24,064
Yeah. She seems really jealous.

481
00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:27,162
I'll text her later.

482
00:35:27,939 --> 00:35:30,674
This is kind of random,
but you have plans Friday night?

483
00:35:30,675 --> 00:35:32,042
None.

484
00:35:32,043 --> 00:35:35,679
Hey, maybe we could watch a movie
or listen to my bag...

485
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,048
...or something.

486
00:35:38,049 --> 00:35:40,312
That would be great.

487
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:50,027
MRS. BLOCK: Hi there, everybody.
JUDI: Oh, hi.

488
00:35:50,028 --> 00:35:53,163
So, Claire, you're coming
to the sleepover Friday night, right?

489
00:35:53,164 --> 00:35:55,933
- I'm sorry?
- Massie's having all the usual suspects.

490
00:35:55,934 --> 00:35:58,268
Dylan, Alicia, Kristen.

491
00:35:58,269 --> 00:35:59,736
She wants me to come?

492
00:35:59,737 --> 00:36:01,838
MRS. BLOCK: Of course.
- I'll go.

493
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,364
Sorry, Todd, no boys.

494
00:36:05,944 --> 00:36:07,511
- Wow, I'd love to come.
- Great.

495
00:36:07,512 --> 00:36:10,674
- Seven o'clock.
- Sounds great.

496
00:36:11,582 --> 00:36:15,017
- Maybe I'll invite my friends over too.
- You have friends?

497
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,717
Don't you?

498
00:36:18,256 --> 00:36:19,823
I'm really sorry, Layne.

499
00:36:19,824 --> 00:36:24,061
My parents have to go out Friday night,
so I have to babysit my little brother.

500
00:36:24,062 --> 00:36:27,258
Maybe we can hang out another time?

501
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,600
Great. Bye.

502
00:36:34,672 --> 00:36:36,540
- Yeah?
- I like it.

503
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:38,141
- Isn't it awesome?
- Not.

504
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:40,041
No.

505
00:36:40,345 --> 00:36:43,814
Seriously, this is, like,
'60s/medieval.

506
00:36:43,815 --> 00:36:45,782
- That's really cute.
- Seriously?

507
00:36:45,783 --> 00:36:48,251
- Check it out.
- For sure.

508
00:36:48,252 --> 00:36:49,453
- Ew.
- Ew.

509
00:36:49,454 --> 00:36:52,149
Get rid of it. It's nasty.

510
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:54,291
Oh, God, no.

511
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:56,159
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

512
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,662
- Yeah, I...
- Well, you know...

513
00:36:58,663 --> 00:37:00,391
What are you doing here?

514
00:37:00,865 --> 00:37:02,923
I'm here for the sleepover.

515
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:07,170
MRS. BLOCK:
Hey, Claire.

516
00:37:07,171 --> 00:37:08,638
Okay, girls, break's over.

517
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:11,942
Clothes you're donating
need to go in these boxes for the auction.

518
00:37:11,943 --> 00:37:13,210
What auction?

519
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:16,179
We host the OCD auction
to raise money for scholarships.

520
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,682
I know one local charity
that could use a donation.

521
00:37:18,683 --> 00:37:20,810
Massie, kitchen, now.

522
00:37:22,253 --> 00:37:25,483
- Hey, let's go down to the cabana.
- Yeah.

523
00:37:31,796 --> 00:37:34,598
Mom. How could you do this to me?

524
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:37,034
I told you
if you didn't invite Claire, I would.

525
00:37:37,035 --> 00:37:40,103
- I didn't think you actually meant it.
- Just try to be nice.

526
00:37:40,104 --> 00:37:43,874
I did, but, Mom, you should see
how she treats me at school.

527
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:47,477
She's not this nice, sweet, innocent girl
everyone makes her out to be.

528
00:37:47,478 --> 00:37:50,280
I know you, and there are always
two sides to your story.

529
00:37:50,281 --> 00:37:52,682
It'd be nice
if you took my side for a change.

530
00:37:52,683 --> 00:37:55,981
You need to take Bean for a walk.

531
00:38:10,802 --> 00:38:14,337
MASSIE:
Um... I'm going down to the cabana.

532
00:38:14,338 --> 00:38:16,073
That's where we sleep.

533
00:38:16,074 --> 00:38:17,836
Come if you want.

534
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,534
Or not.

535
00:38:22,113 --> 00:38:24,080
Okay.

536
00:38:33,191 --> 00:38:36,426
Okay, would you rather be A,
a friendless loser...

537
00:38:36,427 --> 00:38:39,429
...or B, a person with tons of friends
who secretly hate you?

538
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,897
Oh, easy. B.

539
00:38:40,898 --> 00:38:42,099
Definitely B.

540
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,034
B all the way.

541
00:38:45,636 --> 00:38:47,070
ALICIA:
Claire, what do you think?

542
00:38:47,071 --> 00:38:49,139
Would you rather be a friendless loser...

543
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,975
...or a person with tons of friends
who secretly hate you?

544
00:38:51,976 --> 00:38:53,710
Um...

545
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:56,179
I guess I'd rather be the friendless loser.

546
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,511
Congrats, you got your wish.

547
00:38:59,117 --> 00:39:01,414
- Harsh.
- I was kidding.

548
00:39:01,452 --> 00:39:03,753
Claire, ever play Truth or Dare?

549
00:39:03,754 --> 00:39:05,188
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

550
00:39:05,189 --> 00:39:07,958
- No, yeah, that would be...
- Remember that one time when we...?

551
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:11,027
- Are you just gonna stand there all night?
DYLAN: I have a good idea.

552
00:39:11,028 --> 00:39:12,963
- Okay.
- Right, that one, that one.

553
00:39:12,964 --> 00:39:14,764
Okay, someone ask me first.

554
00:39:14,765 --> 00:39:16,032
My house. Me first.

555
00:39:16,033 --> 00:39:17,534
Okay.

556
00:39:17,535 --> 00:39:18,902
Truth or dare?

557
00:39:18,903 --> 00:39:21,605
- Mm. Truth.
- Okay.

558
00:39:21,606 --> 00:39:23,039
Have you ever kissed a boy?

559
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,775
No, you guys, that's stupid.
We already know the answer.

560
00:39:25,776 --> 00:39:30,380
No, but ask me after the auction
and the answer will be a definite yes.

561
00:39:30,381 --> 00:39:32,974
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

562
00:39:33,284 --> 00:39:35,719
Okay, Claire, truth or dare?

563
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,915
- Dare.
- Who do you like?

564
00:39:40,558 --> 00:39:44,361
Um... I like a lot of people.
I like my parents, my friends...

565
00:39:44,362 --> 00:39:48,457
Not just like. "Like" like,
like more-than-a-friend like.

566
00:39:48,933 --> 00:39:50,433
I don't know.

567
00:39:50,434 --> 00:39:54,631
If you had to pick.
Someone here in Westchester.

568
00:39:55,573 --> 00:39:58,564
Well, I guess I don't really know anyone.

569
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,783
Okay, there was
this skateboard guy, Chris.

570
00:40:06,784 --> 00:40:10,086
He's got this shaggy blond hair,
deep blue eyes, scar above his...

571
00:40:10,087 --> 00:40:11,655
You mean Chris Abeley?

572
00:40:11,656 --> 00:40:14,524
That's the guy Massie
was just talking about kissing.

573
00:40:14,525 --> 00:40:17,152
Wait, is he your boyfriend?

574
00:40:17,195 --> 00:40:18,695
ALICIA:
Wow, Claire.

575
00:40:18,696 --> 00:40:21,965
You in accelerated math? You're good
at putting two and two together.

576
00:40:21,966 --> 00:40:26,403
Guys, stop talking about school.
It's really stressing me out.

577
00:40:26,404 --> 00:40:28,531
Can we just go to bed?

578
00:40:37,949 --> 00:40:40,417
Oh, my God. Claire, was that you?

579
00:40:40,418 --> 00:40:41,851
How embarrassing.

580
00:40:47,325 --> 00:40:51,194
Funny, Leesh, I thought it was the sound
of your boobs rubbing together.

581
00:40:51,195 --> 00:40:53,686
DYLAN:
Snap.

582
00:40:54,465 --> 00:40:57,058
Let's just go to sleep.

583
00:41:17,755 --> 00:41:20,348
Claire, wait.

584
00:41:20,658 --> 00:41:22,192
You don't have to go.

585
00:41:22,193 --> 00:41:24,094
Have to?

586
00:41:24,095 --> 00:41:25,829
I want to.

587
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:28,161
Fine. Whatever.

588
00:41:34,805 --> 00:41:38,208
Should we make our lip gloss
with lavender oil or peanut oil?

589
00:41:38,209 --> 00:41:39,609
Or this recipe has both.

590
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,911
Not peanut. Massie's allergic.

591
00:41:41,912 --> 00:41:45,348
Please. Nothing touches these lips
but MAC and...

592
00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:47,050
- Chris Abeley.
- Exactly.

593
00:41:47,051 --> 00:41:49,052
No, I mean Chris Abeley, he's here.

594
00:41:49,053 --> 00:41:50,986
What?

595
00:41:53,924 --> 00:41:56,493
LAYNE: Hey, Claire.
- Hey, glad you could make it.

596
00:41:56,494 --> 00:41:58,291
Oh, Claire, meet my brother.

597
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:00,130
Chris. We've met.

598
00:42:00,131 --> 00:42:02,963
We had a little run-in
on the first day of school.

599
00:42:03,934 --> 00:42:06,870
If you're looking for your girlfriend,
she's up there.

600
00:42:06,871 --> 00:42:09,396
My girlfriend lives across town.

601
00:42:09,407 --> 00:42:11,541
- But I thought your girlfriend was...
LAYNE: Fawn.

602
00:42:11,542 --> 00:42:14,511
Yeah, she's perfect, she's beautiful...

603
00:42:14,512 --> 00:42:17,071
...and they've been together
since 7th grade.

604
00:42:17,548 --> 00:42:20,016
It's sickening.

605
00:42:20,117 --> 00:42:22,252
MAN: Chris, if you wanna go riding,
we gotta go.

606
00:42:22,253 --> 00:42:25,916
Oh, Chris, wait.
It's just something in your hair.

607
00:42:34,165 --> 00:42:35,732
There.

608
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:37,367
Got it.

609
00:42:37,368 --> 00:42:42,328
Isaac!

610
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,441
MASSIE:
Hey.

611
00:42:48,612 --> 00:42:50,480
Hey.

612
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:53,717
So how could you come to my house
and not bother to say hi?

613
00:42:53,718 --> 00:42:56,653
Sorry. My dad, he was in a hurry.

614
00:42:56,654 --> 00:42:59,989
How could you have not told me
Layne's your sister? I love Layne.

615
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:02,859
- Really? Since when?
- Since always.

616
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,763
- We should invite Layne riding sometime.
- Yeah, Layne doesn't really ride.

617
00:43:06,764 --> 00:43:09,165
I could teach her. I'm a great teacher.

618
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:11,801
Patient and compassionate and...

619
00:43:11,802 --> 00:43:13,303
- And modest.
- Yeah, that too.

620
00:43:13,304 --> 00:43:14,938
We should all hang out sometime.

621
00:43:14,939 --> 00:43:16,573
What are you doing with my hat?

622
00:43:16,574 --> 00:43:18,875
I'm gonna donate it
at the auction on Saturday.

623
00:43:18,876 --> 00:43:20,877
- Better not.
- You'll just have to come.

624
00:43:20,878 --> 00:43:23,346
Actually,
the day of the auction's my birthday.

625
00:43:23,347 --> 00:43:26,611
Oh. What better place to celebrate?

626
00:43:46,137 --> 00:43:49,333
Layne, you're just the person
I wanted to see.

627
00:43:49,573 --> 00:43:51,508
- I am?
- Mm-hm.

628
00:43:51,509 --> 00:43:54,500
I have so much to tell you.

629
00:43:55,846 --> 00:43:59,179
Layne. Layne.

630
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,084
Layne.

631
00:44:01,085 --> 00:44:04,354
I tried to MySpace you last night,
but it didn't go through.

632
00:44:04,355 --> 00:44:08,224
The thing is, I don't really have time
for friend requests right now...

633
00:44:08,225 --> 00:44:11,594
...because I'm really busy, you know,
babysitting my brother.

634
00:44:11,595 --> 00:44:13,329
But your brother's 15.

635
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:14,998
MASSIE:
Layne.

636
00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:18,601
Layne, are we still on
for manis and pedis after school?

637
00:44:18,602 --> 00:44:20,535
For suresies.

638
00:44:23,474 --> 00:44:26,109
Whoa. Wait a sec. You and Massie?

639
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,278
Since when do you
wanna be friends with her?

640
00:44:28,279 --> 00:44:30,814
Everyone wants to be friends
with Massie.

641
00:44:30,815 --> 00:44:34,409
Isn't that why you lied to me
and ditched me for her sleepover?

642
00:44:35,386 --> 00:44:36,953
Yeah.

643
00:44:36,954 --> 00:44:38,888
That's what I thought.

644
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:40,957
Hey, Mass, wait up.

645
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:43,193
Hey, Massie, wait up. Massie.

646
00:44:43,194 --> 00:44:45,061
Layne, enough with the all caps.

647
00:44:45,062 --> 00:44:46,790
Stop yelling.

648
00:44:47,498 --> 00:44:49,898
I told you not to talk to me at school.

649
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:54,070
- But I thought we were friends now.
- We are.

650
00:44:54,071 --> 00:44:56,039
Secret friends. Top-secret.

651
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,768
Okay?

652
00:44:59,477 --> 00:45:01,678
Okay.

653
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:03,446
Hi.

654
00:45:03,447 --> 00:45:05,348
Why were you talking to Layne Abeley?

655
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:07,951
I was yelling at her for getting oatmeal
on my Fendi.

656
00:45:07,952 --> 00:45:09,152
Enough about Layne.

657
00:45:09,153 --> 00:45:11,955
I'm calling an emergency
Glambition meeting after school.

658
00:45:11,956 --> 00:45:15,325
The field trip is in six days
and we haven't made our lip gloss yet.

659
00:45:15,326 --> 00:45:17,760
I've actually got somewhere to be
after school.

660
00:45:17,761 --> 00:45:20,663
Does it involve
someone named Chris Babely?

661
00:45:20,664 --> 00:45:22,866
Oh, you could say that.

662
00:45:22,867 --> 00:45:24,067
Listen, tell you what.

663
00:45:24,068 --> 00:45:27,804
Meet at my house at 5, tell the girls.
What I have to do shouldn't take long.

664
00:45:27,805 --> 00:45:30,006
- Okay. Bye.
- All right, bye.

665
00:45:30,007 --> 00:45:32,099
MASSIE:
Layne!

666
00:45:33,143 --> 00:45:36,635
Layne, come on,
your water's getting cold.

667
00:45:36,714 --> 00:45:39,011
Sorry, this is her first time.

668
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,843
<i>Do you have
any US Weeklys around here?</i>

669
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:45,381
Okay.

670
00:45:45,823 --> 00:45:48,348
FYI, you're only supposed to pick one.

671
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:53,062
I think it'd be cool to have a different color
on each finger and toe, don't you?

672
00:45:53,063 --> 00:45:56,366
Ah! Okay, hot. It's hot.

673
00:45:56,367 --> 00:45:57,600
You'll get used to it.

674
00:45:57,601 --> 00:46:00,603
Just stick your feet in and relax...

675
00:46:00,604 --> 00:46:02,272
...quietly.

676
00:46:02,273 --> 00:46:07,301
Okay. All right. Ow, ow, ow, ow.

677
00:46:09,847 --> 00:46:13,149
So tell me about Chris.
Are you two close?

678
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:16,346
Yeah, we're like besties.
We tell each other everything.

679
00:46:17,655 --> 00:46:20,646
- So has he mentioned me?
- No.

680
00:46:25,229 --> 00:46:27,492
That tickles.

681
00:46:41,478 --> 00:46:43,741
We're having a private meeting.

682
00:46:44,648 --> 00:46:46,342
If Mass ever shows.

683
00:46:49,687 --> 00:46:51,888
Claire, are you a bird?

684
00:46:51,889 --> 00:46:53,122
No.

685
00:46:53,123 --> 00:46:55,658
Then why is your suit so cheap?

686
00:46:55,659 --> 00:46:57,860
Cheap, cheap, cheap.

687
00:46:57,861 --> 00:47:01,431
Actually, Leesh,
it's an original Astrid from Brazil.

688
00:47:01,432 --> 00:47:03,366
I'm surprised you couldn't tell.

689
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:05,027
I've heard of Astrid.

690
00:47:05,202 --> 00:47:08,171
<i>I read a whole article about her
in Teen Vogue.</i>

691
00:47:08,172 --> 00:47:09,764
You mean, him?

692
00:47:10,741 --> 00:47:12,809
Seriously, what is taking Massie so long?

693
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:15,445
This project is worth
a bazillion percent of my grade.

694
00:47:15,446 --> 00:47:19,040
If I fail,
I'm stealing her tweezers for a month.

695
00:47:19,617 --> 00:47:22,452
Would it kill you to have a little fun
while you waited?

696
00:47:22,453 --> 00:47:25,547
With you? Probably.

697
00:47:31,895 --> 00:47:34,226
That was sweet.

698
00:47:35,532 --> 00:47:37,727
You guys should really come in.

699
00:47:39,436 --> 00:47:43,106
Why not?
It's not like we're doing anything.

700
00:48:10,501 --> 00:48:11,968
MASSIE:
What's going on?

701
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:15,138
I thought we were having a meeting.

702
00:48:15,139 --> 00:48:17,507
Well, we were,
but you were an hour late.

703
00:48:17,508 --> 00:48:20,410
I wasn't late, I was lost.

704
00:48:20,411 --> 00:48:22,445
Thank God
Chris Abeley was a Boy Scout...

705
00:48:22,446 --> 00:48:25,515
...or I swear I would've never made it
out of the woods.

706
00:48:25,516 --> 00:48:27,784
I seriously could've died out there.

707
00:48:27,785 --> 00:48:30,319
- Thank God you're safe.
DYLAN: What if something happened?

708
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,922
We would've never finished our project.

709
00:48:32,923 --> 00:48:34,691
Nice suit, Claire.

710
00:48:34,692 --> 00:48:36,359
It's an original Astrid.

711
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:41,431
Unless Astrid means bargain-basement,
chain-store, low-rent knockoff...

712
00:48:41,432 --> 00:48:43,422
...I don't think so.

713
00:49:00,918 --> 00:49:03,019
Hey. What's up?

714
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,754
- Hey.
- What's wrong?

715
00:49:04,755 --> 00:49:06,279
Claire, Claire.

716
00:49:07,758 --> 00:49:09,816
What's wrong? What happened?

717
00:49:09,827 --> 00:49:11,692
Nothing.

718
00:49:11,762 --> 00:49:13,786
Did something happen at the pool?

719
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:17,527
Was it Massie?

720
00:49:18,969 --> 00:49:20,903
- What did she do?
- I told you, nothing.

721
00:49:20,904 --> 00:49:23,372
If it's nothing,
then why are you so upset?

722
00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:28,778
Either you tell me what's going on here
or I'm gonna go find out for myself.

723
00:49:28,779 --> 00:49:31,147
Mom, no, please. You can't do that.

724
00:49:31,148 --> 00:49:34,117
It was a stupid misunderstanding.
It was nothing.

725
00:49:34,118 --> 00:49:36,886
I'll talk to Massie about it.
It'll be cool, really.

726
00:49:36,887 --> 00:49:39,722
Why don't you go talk about it
right now?

727
00:49:39,723 --> 00:49:42,714
After dinner, once my homework's done.

728
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,360
Fine, after dinner.

729
00:49:44,361 --> 00:49:47,063
Either you talk to Massie
or I'm gonna talk to her mom.

730
00:49:47,064 --> 00:49:48,997
Okay?

731
00:49:59,943 --> 00:50:01,878
CLAIRE:
Hi, Mrs. Block. Is Massie home?

732
00:50:01,879 --> 00:50:04,677
No, honey, she's not. Can I help you?

733
00:50:04,982 --> 00:50:07,583
I just needed to talk to her
about pre-algebra.

734
00:50:07,584 --> 00:50:10,620
She just took Bean for a walk.
You're welcome to wait for her.

735
00:50:10,621 --> 00:50:12,281
Okay.

736
00:51:47,985 --> 00:51:50,686
<i>I didn't realize Peter Pan
was holding auditions today.</i>

737
00:51:50,687 --> 00:51:53,087
I hope you get the part.

738
00:52:22,753 --> 00:52:25,521
Ew. What are you wearing?

739
00:52:25,522 --> 00:52:28,958
<i>What are you wearing? I thought
we were going all Teen Vogue- ish today.</i>

740
00:52:28,959 --> 00:52:31,757
- Hey, Claire.
- Hey, Leesh.

741
00:52:36,133 --> 00:52:38,328
Come on, Bean.

742
00:52:59,523 --> 00:53:01,357
Hey.

743
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:02,558
- Todd.
- Don't mind me.

744
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:03,759
What are you doing?

745
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,285
What are you doing?

746
00:53:57,948 --> 00:54:01,951
Even Mary-Kate knew
when her boho look had run its course.

747
00:54:01,952 --> 00:54:04,044
Laundry day.

748
00:54:06,957 --> 00:54:08,958
MASSIE:
Bean.

749
00:54:08,959 --> 00:54:13,462
Bean. Bean.

750
00:54:13,463 --> 00:54:15,794
Bean.

751
00:54:15,932 --> 00:54:18,367
Where are you, Bean?

752
00:54:18,368 --> 00:54:22,167
Shh. No barking and no pooping.

753
00:54:23,807 --> 00:54:26,036
I'll be back soon.

754
00:54:39,756 --> 00:54:41,883
TODD:
Man, I can't believe this.

755
00:54:44,694 --> 00:54:46,328
Todd, stop doing that.

756
00:54:46,329 --> 00:54:49,198
She's got, like, a gazillion pictures.

757
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:52,134
Don't you think she'd have one
without her annoying friends?

758
00:54:52,135 --> 00:54:56,372
Don't worry. If this works, Massie will be
without her annoying friends soon enough.

759
00:54:56,373 --> 00:55:00,138
- And put the pictures back.
- "Put the pictures back. "

760

00:56:00,871 --> 00:56:03,806
<i>KRISTEN:
Oh, my God times two.</i>

781
00:56:03,807 --> 00:56:06,332
<i>CLAIRE:
Okay, your turn.</i>

782
00:56:06,343 --> 00:56:09,445
<i>KRISTEN:
Okay, but you can't tell.</i>

783
00:56:09,446 --> 00:56:12,615
<i>You know how I'm always worried
about grades?</i>

784
00:56:12,616 --> 00:56:15,484
<i>It's not just because
I have strict parents.</i>

785
00:56:15,485 --> 00:56:18,220
<i>It's because I have poor parents.</i>

786
00:56:18,221 --> 00:56:21,349
<i>I'm on a scholarship at OCD.</i>

787
00:56:21,658 --> 00:56:24,527
<i>CLAIRE:
Oh, my God times three.</i>

788
00:56:24,528 --> 00:56:28,020
<i>But you live in the Montador building.</i>

789
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:32,134
<i>KRISTEN: No, we live in
the apartment building next door.</i>

790
00:56:32,135 --> 00:56:35,037
<i>You better not tell.
Not even for gossip points.</i>

791
00:56:35,038 --> 00:56:36,238
MASSIE:
Bean.

792
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:37,439
<i>KRISTEN:
Massie, promise.</i>

793
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,008
MASSIE:
Bean, are you in here?

794
00:56:39,009 --> 00:56:41,577
It's Massie. She's back, she's coming.

795
00:56:41,578 --> 00:56:43,979
Go, go under the bed. Go.

796
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:46,505
Bean.

797
00:56:55,659 --> 00:56:58,561
<i>KRISTEN:
Seriously, you can't tell the other girls.</i>

798
00:56:58,562 --> 00:57:00,329
<i>MASSIE:
What are you talking about?</i>

799
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:02,164
<i>KRISTEN:
What I just told you.</i>

800
00:57:02,165 --> 00:57:03,566
<i>MASSIE:
Huh?</i>

801
00:57:03,567 --> 00:57:05,067
<i>KRISTEN:
Nice. Forget it, Mass.</i>

802
00:57:13,243 --> 00:57:16,545
We have to do something.
We can't stay under here all night.

803
00:57:16,546 --> 00:57:19,915
- You have to go out there.
- No way.

804
00:57:19,916 --> 00:57:24,147
You can play the "creepy little brother
crushing on the hot neighbor" angle.

805
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:29,525
Todd, I'm serious. Help.

806
00:57:29,526 --> 00:57:33,894
If I do this, you owe me bigtime.

807
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:46,075
Oh, my God!
What are you doing in here?

808
00:57:46,076 --> 00:57:48,373
Wait, this isn't the guesthouse?

809
00:57:49,779 --> 00:57:52,214
Oh, my God. Mom.

810
00:57:52,215 --> 00:57:53,977
Mom.

811
00:57:54,317 --> 00:57:57,149
What is going on?

812
00:57:58,688 --> 00:57:59,989
Thank God.

813
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:01,923
Thank me.

814
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:08,330
What's that?

815
00:58:08,331 --> 00:58:10,633
A letter to the West Law
neighborhood security.

816
00:58:10,634 --> 00:58:14,670
I'm thinking of filing a restraining order
against that prepubescent monkey boy.

817
00:58:14,671 --> 00:58:17,039
Why don't you talk
to your new BFF about it?

818
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,174
After all, the monkey freak's her brother.

819
00:58:19,175 --> 00:58:21,343
Claire's not my BFF.

820
00:58:21,344 --> 00:58:23,712
Kristen asked her
to sign up for squash with us.

821
00:58:23,713 --> 00:58:28,083
She gave me her extra racket.
What was I supposed to do, ignore her?

822
00:58:28,084 --> 00:58:30,119
Yeah. That's what we always do.

823
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,988
And since when can't you afford
your own racket?

824
00:58:32,989 --> 00:58:34,890
Nice, Mass, that's real nice. Thanks.

825
00:58:34,891 --> 00:58:36,091
Thanks a lot.

826
00:58:36,092 --> 00:58:38,093
What?

827
00:58:38,094 --> 00:58:41,230
Remind me
not to go on the scale anymore.

828
00:58:41,231 --> 00:58:44,600
If you're gonna weigh yourself,
take off that tent you call a skirt.

829
00:58:44,601 --> 00:58:46,101
It must weigh 15 pounds.

830
00:58:46,102 --> 00:58:48,971
Which is nothing compared
to my thunder thighs, right?

831
00:58:48,972 --> 00:58:50,406
What is everyone's problem?

832
00:58:50,407 --> 00:58:52,908
Who are you
and what have you done with my friends?

833
00:58:52,909 --> 00:58:56,401
By friends, do you mean us or Layne?

834
00:58:56,846 --> 00:58:58,981
I'm not friends with Layne Abeley.

835
00:58:58,982 --> 00:59:00,416
Hey, guys, what's going on?

836
00:59:00,417 --> 00:59:03,715
What's going on is a spot in our foursome
just opened up.

837
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:07,383
- Wanna join us, Claire?
- But I thought you already had four.

838
00:59:07,824 --> 00:59:09,382
Not anymore.

839
00:59:13,096 --> 00:59:14,396
Whoa, you...

840
00:59:14,397 --> 00:59:19,061
Wait a sec.
You guys are choosing Claire over me?

841
00:59:20,203 --> 00:59:22,364
Well?

842
00:59:27,477 --> 00:59:29,444
I'm in.

843
00:59:32,515 --> 00:59:34,116
GIRL 1:
Oh, my God. Did you see?

844
00:59:34,117 --> 00:59:36,418
GIRL 2: I know. It was just...
GIRL 3: Yeah.

845
00:59:36,419 --> 00:59:38,921
GIRL 4:
She's such a loser now.

846
00:59:38,922 --> 00:59:41,590
GIRL 5: Thank you.
GIRL 2: I know.

847
00:59:41,591 --> 00:59:42,891
GIRL 4:
She really deserves it.

848
00:59:42,892 --> 00:59:44,450
GIRL 6:
I'm not fat, am I?

849
00:59:52,369 --> 00:59:55,099
Oh, my God, wait. Oh, my God.

850
00:59:55,472 --> 00:59:57,139
Hey, Mass.

851
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:00,008
There's an empty seat here
if you wanna sit with us, you know?

852
01:00:00,009 --> 01:00:02,711
Um... No, that's okay.

853
01:00:02,712 --> 01:00:05,647
- Have you seen Jenna or Tricia?
- I said that you could sit...

854
01:00:05,648 --> 01:00:08,717
The only place I wanna sit
is with my friends.

855
01:00:08,718 --> 01:00:12,483
I wouldn't be caught dead sitting with you.
I don't even like you.

856
01:00:13,256 --> 01:00:14,957
God, you really are a bitch.

857
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:18,188
<i>Sorry, no comprende. I don't speak loser.</i>

858
01:00:18,595 --> 01:00:20,460
<i>No hablas bitch.</i>

859
01:00:20,597 --> 01:00:23,065
Mass, there's a free seat right here.

860
01:00:29,406 --> 01:00:31,806
Love the look.

861
01:00:44,687 --> 01:00:46,622
Where is everyone?

862
01:00:46,623 --> 01:00:49,956
They're in detention. Let's just go.

863
01:00:53,229 --> 01:00:55,197
Oh, wait. There they are.

864
01:00:55,198 --> 01:00:56,932
CLAIRE:
I'm so excited.

865
01:00:56,933 --> 01:00:59,663
We have to go shopping there.

866
01:01:00,069 --> 01:01:01,570
Oh, my God. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

867
01:01:01,571 --> 01:01:04,801
That's gonna be so much fun.

868
01:01:05,008 --> 01:01:06,675
Yeah.

869
01:01:06,676 --> 01:01:08,837
Can we just go?

870
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:19,655
ALICIA:
Okay. We need a dressing room.

871
01:01:19,656 --> 01:01:23,091
You said you already had
a totally slutty dress to wear to the auction.

872
01:01:23,092 --> 01:01:25,526
I do. These are for you.

873
01:01:26,796 --> 01:01:29,031
I can't.

874
01:01:29,032 --> 01:01:31,533
I spent all my allowance
on that new Chloé handbag.

875
01:01:31,534 --> 01:01:34,269
The one Lindsay Lohan
was carrying in that accident.

876
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:36,294
So I'll pay.

877
01:01:36,673 --> 01:01:38,006
You'd buy me a dress?

878
01:01:38,007 --> 01:01:40,566
Actually,
one of my three best friends will.

879
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:42,578
Dylan, Kristen or Massie?

880
01:01:42,579 --> 01:01:44,913
No, try Visa, MasterCard or Amex.

881
01:01:44,914 --> 01:01:48,217
Oh, and this is for you.

882
01:01:48,218 --> 01:01:49,885
- Your cell?
- I upgraded.

883
01:01:49,886 --> 01:01:52,120
- iPhone.
- I can't take your cell phone.

884
01:01:52,121 --> 01:01:53,689
Why? I'm not using it.

885
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:56,525
I've erased all my info,
so you can totally make it yours.

886
01:01:56,526 --> 01:01:58,961
We can't hang with you
if we can't reach you.

887
01:01:58,962 --> 01:02:01,096
When we're done,
let's go back to my house.

888
01:02:01,097 --> 01:02:03,765
- I don't know. I have to be home by 5.
- Make it 7.

889
01:02:03,766 --> 01:02:06,166
Trust me. It'll be worth it.

890
01:02:14,911 --> 01:02:17,402
- Okay. Oh, my God.
- Okay, wait.

891
01:02:18,281 --> 01:02:20,646
Just shake it off. We shake it off.

892
01:02:34,197 --> 01:02:36,031
Oh, my God.

893
01:02:36,032 --> 01:02:38,966
- Here.
- Put it on.

894
01:02:41,571 --> 01:02:43,672
- You look good.
- Oh, my God.

895
01:02:43,673 --> 01:02:45,936
It's cute.

896
01:02:47,443 --> 01:02:49,171
I think it's pretty.

897
01:02:52,348 --> 01:02:54,475
- I love it.
- That's the one.

898
01:02:55,985 --> 01:02:58,612
Oh, my God.

899
01:03:00,924 --> 01:03:03,119
Okay.

900
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:22,711
Thanks, Leesh. Today was seriously,
like, the greatest day ever.

901
01:03:22,712 --> 01:03:24,212
Where have you been?

902
01:03:24,213 --> 01:03:25,714
We have been worried sick.

903
01:03:25,715 --> 01:03:27,749
I called Layne, Massie.

904
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:30,385
I sent your father out
to look for you.

905
01:03:30,386 --> 01:03:32,220
You called Massie? What did she say?

906
01:03:32,221 --> 01:03:35,490
She said you were probably out
with Dylan, Alicia and Kristen.

907
01:03:35,491 --> 01:03:37,492
- Claire.
- What?

908
01:03:37,493 --> 01:03:39,161
We were shopping. Big deal.

909
01:03:39,162 --> 01:03:42,564
It's a big deal
when you are over two hours late.

910
01:03:42,565 --> 01:03:44,600
I needed a dress for the auction.

911
01:03:44,601 --> 01:03:46,234
Oh, what, from BCBG?

912
01:03:46,235 --> 01:03:47,736
We can't afford that.

913
01:03:47,737 --> 01:03:49,605
It's fine, Mom. Alicia paid.

914
01:03:49,606 --> 01:03:52,074
- No, Claire, that is not fine.
- Then what is?

915
01:03:52,075 --> 01:03:55,043
For me to wear overalls
or some lame bathing suit?

916
01:03:55,044 --> 01:03:58,280
We're not in Florida anymore, Mom.
The Gap doesn't cut it here.

917
01:03:58,281 --> 01:04:01,875
- Neither does your attitude.
- Well, sue me for trying to fit in.

918
01:04:02,385 --> 01:04:05,220
You're not hanging out
with those girls anymore.

919
01:04:05,221 --> 01:04:06,588
Mom, you can't do that.

920
01:04:06,589 --> 01:04:07,789
Oh, yes, I can.

921
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:11,193
If you continue with this attitude,
you will not be needing a dress...

922
01:04:11,194 --> 01:04:14,595
...to go to that auction,
because you will not be going.

923
01:05:29,972 --> 01:05:32,099
Yes.

924
01:05:37,914 --> 01:05:39,781
So it's all in there.

925
01:05:39,782 --> 01:05:41,683
There's also four different flavors.

926
01:05:41,684 --> 01:05:44,286
Alicia, Kristen, Dylan and Massie.

927
01:05:44,287 --> 01:05:47,517
But you can get rid of the Massie
if you want.

928
01:05:48,357 --> 01:05:51,593
Are you seriously trying
to make me feel bad for you or something?

929
01:05:51,594 --> 01:05:52,961
You should feel bad.

930
01:05:52,962 --> 01:05:56,832
You guys ditched me for no reason,
and worse, for Claire.

931
01:05:56,833 --> 01:06:02,270
That's like turning down, I don't know,
Justin Timberlake for K-Fed.

932
01:06:02,271 --> 01:06:03,672
It's just wrong.

933
01:06:03,673 --> 01:06:06,541
You're the one who decided
to become buddy-buddy with her.

934
01:06:06,542 --> 01:06:07,743
Since when?

935
01:06:07,744 --> 01:06:10,312
Since you started hanging out
and watching her DVDs.

936
01:06:10,313 --> 01:06:13,148
The only thing I've watched
are her chronic bad hair days.

937
01:06:13,149 --> 01:06:15,951
You told Alicia
right after you called Dylan fat.

938
01:06:15,952 --> 01:06:17,885
I never called Dylan fat.

939
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,088
Yes, you did, two nights ago.

940
01:06:20,089 --> 01:06:22,190
No, I didn't, at least not to her face.

941
01:06:22,191 --> 01:06:23,825
Look, I'll prove it. See?

942
01:06:23,826 --> 01:06:26,061
She called me right after, 10:01.

943
01:06:26,062 --> 01:06:28,663
Two nights ago at 10:01,
I was out looking for Bean.

944
01:06:28,664 --> 01:06:30,565
<i>I missed the beginning of The Hills.</i>

945
01:06:30,566 --> 01:06:33,435
But that doesn't make any sense.
Dylan said you IM'd her.

946
01:06:33,436 --> 01:06:37,038
- Well, I didn't.
- Like you don't remember what I told you.

947
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:40,375
- What you told me when?
- The night after, when we were IM'ing.

948
01:06:40,376 --> 01:06:42,277
When you were mad at me
for no reason?

949
01:06:42,278 --> 01:06:44,346
Which, by the way, was totally selfish...

950
01:06:44,347 --> 01:06:47,282
...considering I waited an hour
for Chris Abeley to show.

951
01:06:47,283 --> 01:06:50,452
- When were you waiting for Chris Abeley?
- Like, until 10:00.

952
01:06:50,453 --> 01:06:54,445
- We were IM'ing before that.
- No, I wasn't!

953
01:06:59,228 --> 01:07:01,525
But maybe someone else was.

954
01:07:06,769 --> 01:07:09,362
JUDI:
Claire, it's for you.

955
01:07:10,339 --> 01:07:13,809
- Hello?
- Hey, Claire, it's Kris.

956
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:15,777
Hey. Hold on a sec.

957
01:07:15,778 --> 01:07:19,714
Todd, hang up the phone.
I can hear you breathing.

958
01:07:19,982 --> 01:07:22,450
Actually, it's not Todd, it's me.

959
01:07:22,451 --> 01:07:24,219
- Dylan?
- And me.

960
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:27,255
Oh, hey, Leesh.
Wow, I've never been on a four-way before.

961
01:07:27,256 --> 01:07:30,258
<i>- Fun.
MASSIE: Actually, it's a five-way.</i>

962
01:07:30,259 --> 01:07:33,995
Fun's over.
We know what you did, Claire.

963
01:07:33,996 --> 01:07:36,726
Hijacking my IM, so not cool.

964
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:40,826
So here's a little message for you.

965
01:08:01,157 --> 01:08:04,956
Leesh. My mom will freak
if she sees your feet on the counter.

966
01:08:05,862 --> 01:08:09,889
Okay, here.

967
01:08:10,099 --> 01:08:12,067
I'm excited. They're so cute.

968
01:08:12,068 --> 01:08:13,735
Oh, my God.

969
01:08:13,736 --> 01:08:17,171
Okay, ready? One, two, three, go.

970
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,764
Okay.

971
01:08:19,809 --> 01:08:21,309
- Oh, my God.
- What is this?

972
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:22,677
Oh, my God. Adorable.

973
01:08:22,678 --> 01:08:24,980
I figured they're so much cuter
than lab coats.

974
01:08:24,981 --> 01:08:26,181
Agreed.

975
01:08:26,182 --> 01:08:27,983
Oh, look, it says Glambition.

976
01:08:27,984 --> 01:08:30,679
- I heart this.
- It says our names. Awesome.

977
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,688
Okay, girls.
Where's the bottles, the recipes?

978
01:08:33,956 --> 01:08:36,691
KRISTEN:
Okay. Recipe number one.

979
01:08:36,692 --> 01:08:40,395
Two tablespoons of honey,
three to four drops of peanut oil...

980
01:08:40,396 --> 01:08:41,763
...four ounces of vanilla.

981
01:08:41,764 --> 01:08:44,532
- I need an honest opinion.
- Your butt doesn't look big.

982
01:08:44,533 --> 01:08:46,134
Please, I know.

983
01:08:46,135 --> 01:08:48,570
The day of the auction
is Chris Abeley's birthday.

984
01:08:48,571 --> 01:08:52,040
As his practically girlfriend,
I need to do something really memorable.

985
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:54,634
I am now opening the floor
to suggestions.

986
01:08:55,144 --> 01:08:58,246
- Oh, I know. You should bake him a cake.
KRISTEN: What?

987
01:08:58,247 --> 01:09:02,417
My mom always says the best way
to a boy's heart is through his stomach.

988
01:09:02,418 --> 01:09:04,953
No, no.
How about you be in a cake and jump out?

989
01:09:04,954 --> 01:09:07,088
- And jump out. Yeah, that's great.
- Yeah.

990
01:09:07,089 --> 01:09:09,658
- Please, that's ridiculous.
- More than ridiculous.

991
01:09:09,659 --> 01:09:10,859
Ridunkulous.

992
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:14,663
Yeah, but it would be kind of cool
to wear a cute little outfit or something.

993
01:09:14,664 --> 01:09:17,257
You know, when you jump out.

994
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,036
You know what?
I'm gonna do that and something better.

995
01:09:21,037 --> 01:09:22,902
God, I'm a genius.

996
01:09:26,609 --> 01:09:28,276
Do you have a problem, Stare?

997
01:09:28,277 --> 01:09:30,712
No, my mom wanted to borrow an egg.

998
01:09:30,713 --> 01:09:34,148
An egg? Sure.

999
01:09:34,517 --> 01:09:36,507
Here you go.

1000
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:39,114
Catch.

1001
01:09:52,335 --> 01:09:55,668
I am so back.

1002
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:58,773
Hey, what happened?

1003
01:09:58,774 --> 01:10:01,504
Claire, wait a minute.

1004
01:10:02,645 --> 01:10:03,845
Claire, what's wrong?

1005
01:10:03,846 --> 01:10:05,380
CLAIRE:
Leave me alone.

1006
01:10:05,381 --> 01:10:08,350
No, Claire. I let it go last time.

1007
01:10:08,351 --> 01:10:10,018
Tell me what's wrong.

1008
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:12,721
Everything.

1009
01:10:12,722 --> 01:10:16,714
This school, this house,
my clothes, Massie, everything.

1010
01:10:18,094 --> 01:10:20,195
She hates me, Mom. She hates me.

1011
01:10:20,196 --> 01:10:23,298
She's been making my life miserable
since the day we came.

1012
01:10:23,299 --> 01:10:26,735
At first, you know,
I just wanted her to like me.

1013
01:10:26,736 --> 01:10:29,838
But then I was just hoping
that she'd stop picking on me.

1014
01:10:29,839 --> 01:10:31,106
I tried everything.

1015
01:10:31,107 --> 01:10:34,474
And I did some things
I shouldn't have done.

1016
01:10:34,844 --> 01:10:37,645
I thought it was the only way.

1017
01:10:37,646 --> 01:10:40,515
I thought it was the only way to...

1018
01:10:40,516 --> 01:10:43,041
To what?

1019
01:10:43,486 --> 01:10:47,615
Oh, Claire, listen to me.
You can't make someone like you.

1020
01:10:47,857 --> 01:10:50,291
You're not in charge
of other people's feelings...

1021
01:10:50,292 --> 01:10:52,657
...or their actions, just yours.

1022
01:10:53,262 --> 01:10:57,391
Maybe some of your actions
weren't so great either.

1023
01:10:59,869 --> 01:11:01,536
You wanna tell me what you did?

1024
01:11:01,537 --> 01:11:05,598
I can't. You wouldn't understand.

1025
01:11:06,142 --> 01:11:08,542
Right, because I was never 12.

1026
01:11:10,613 --> 01:11:11,813
Oh, honey.

1027
01:11:11,814 --> 01:11:15,545
Whatever you did,
you have to make it right.

1028
01:11:15,718 --> 01:11:19,278
But whatever it is, I guarantee you,
it's not as bad as you think.

1029
01:11:19,321 --> 01:11:21,015
It's worse.

1030
01:11:21,524 --> 01:11:25,790
Be yourself, Claire,
not who people want you to be.

1031
01:11:37,206 --> 01:11:38,798
CLAIRE:
Can I sit here?

1032
01:11:47,349 --> 01:11:51,546
Listen, Layne, I'm sorry for everything.

1033
01:11:51,854 --> 01:11:54,789
For ditching you for the sleepover.

1034
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:58,350
For pretending to be friends with Massie.

1035
01:11:59,829 --> 01:12:04,732
I don't know how to explain it,
it's just I wanted to be a part of them.

1036
01:12:04,733 --> 01:12:08,066
To be a part of that group.

1037
01:12:08,404 --> 01:12:13,967
And the more they excluded me,
the more important it became.

1038
01:12:15,111 --> 01:12:18,045
The way people treat them...

1039
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:22,516
...the way that they can have anything
they want whenever they want...

1040
01:12:23,018 --> 01:12:26,885
...well, I guess I just wanted that too.

1041
01:12:29,558 --> 01:12:32,660
I have no idea
what makes them so special.

1042
01:12:32,661 --> 01:12:35,322
They just are.

1043
01:12:35,598 --> 01:12:37,999
It's because they believe that they are.

1044
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,934
So other people do too.

1045
01:12:41,303 --> 01:12:46,331
Even me sometimes.

1046
01:12:48,344 --> 01:12:50,678
Can I please have your attention?

1047
01:12:50,679 --> 01:12:54,205
Excuse me.

1048
01:12:55,317 --> 01:12:56,651
Thank you.

1049
01:12:56,652 --> 01:13:01,088
Now, who's ready
for a revolutionary line of cosmetics?

1050
01:13:01,824 --> 01:13:05,122
Something that tastes
as good as it looks.

1051
01:13:07,163 --> 01:13:10,932
I present to you Glambition.

1052
01:13:10,933 --> 01:13:14,469
And now, our esteemed
and ridiculously hot president...

1053
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:16,130
...Kristen Gregory.

1054
01:13:19,542 --> 01:13:22,076
"Glambition is a new line
of beauty products...

1055
01:13:22,077 --> 01:13:24,479
...made entirely
of all-natural ingredients.

1056
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,114
Over the next few weeks...

1057
01:13:26,115 --> 01:13:28,583
...we will introduce to you
our entire line...

1058
01:13:28,584 --> 01:13:30,084
...of body scrubs...

1059
01:13:30,085 --> 01:13:32,654
...creams, glitters and cheek tints.

1060
01:13:32,655 --> 01:13:35,089
Today, for the very low price...

1061
01:13:35,090 --> 01:13:38,660
...of one for $6 and two for $ 10...

1062
01:13:38,661 --> 01:13:40,929
...we are launching
our flavored lip gloss...

1063
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:43,665
...which comes in four flavors:
mint, cherry...

1064
01:13:43,666 --> 01:13:45,366
...vanilla and raspberry.

1065
01:13:45,367 --> 01:13:49,771
Also known as Dylan, Alicia, Kristen...

1066
01:13:49,772 --> 01:13:51,673
...and Massie. "

1067
01:13:51,674 --> 01:13:56,201
And you better hurry,
we expect the Massies to sell out real fast.

1068
01:13:56,779 --> 01:14:00,646
Oh, sorry, Layne,
we don't sell oatmeal flavor.

1069
01:14:02,651 --> 01:14:05,847
I wish she'd swallow her tongue.

1070
01:14:16,665 --> 01:14:17,865
It stings.

1071
01:14:17,866 --> 01:14:19,993
My lips.

1072
01:14:21,303 --> 01:14:22,904
GIRL 1:
Oh, my God.

1073
01:14:26,442 --> 01:14:27,842
My lips are burning!

1074
01:14:27,843 --> 01:14:29,043
GIRL 2:
Mine too.

1075
01:14:29,044 --> 01:14:31,239
My lips are on fire.

1076
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:33,781
It looks like Jenna's lips got a boob job.

1077
01:14:33,782 --> 01:14:35,316
This is not funny.

1078
01:14:35,317 --> 01:14:36,751
- Yes, it is.
- Yes, it is.

1079
01:14:36,752 --> 01:14:39,254
VINCENT: What's the problem?
- Oh, my God, I need water.

1080
01:14:39,255 --> 01:14:41,155
Okay, girls, please settle down.
We need to...

1081
01:14:43,559 --> 01:14:45,193
I want my money back.

1082
01:14:45,194 --> 01:14:46,394
Oh, my God.

1083
01:14:46,395 --> 01:14:48,396
My dad's gonna sue you.

1084
01:14:48,397 --> 01:14:49,631
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1085
01:14:49,632 --> 01:14:51,199
I'm gonna fail. Do something.

1086
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:54,999
Okay, okay.
Is anyone here allergic to peanuts?

1087
01:14:57,673 --> 01:14:59,435
GIRL 3:
Me, I am.

1088
01:15:00,376 --> 01:15:03,978
They made their makeup with peanuts?
That's the most common allergy ever.

1089
01:15:03,979 --> 01:15:07,215
Everyone says they're popular,
no one says they're geniuses.

1090
01:15:17,893 --> 01:15:19,827
Layne, your oatmeal. I need it.

1091
01:15:19,828 --> 01:15:21,352
Okay.

1092
01:15:21,497 --> 01:15:23,794
Everybody, listen up.

1093
01:15:23,832 --> 01:15:25,300
I have oatmeal.

1094
01:15:25,301 --> 01:15:27,135
We don't need oatmeal. We need help.

1095
01:15:27,136 --> 01:15:28,369
Yeah, help us.

1096
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:30,371
Since when do you help the
Pretty Committee?

1097
01:15:30,372 --> 01:15:33,741
Since everyone's lips are inflating
to the size of Jessica Simpson's.

1098
01:15:33,742 --> 01:15:35,376
This will help.

1099
01:15:35,377 --> 01:15:37,538
Here you go.

1100
01:15:39,315 --> 01:15:41,874
Take it. I know it's gross, take it.

1101
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:46,287
Thank God.

1102
01:15:46,288 --> 01:15:49,257
Thank you so much, Claire.
I don't know what I would've done.

1103
01:15:49,258 --> 01:15:51,659
My lips are my best feature.

1104
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:53,923
KRISTEN:
Claire, hey.

1105
01:15:55,064 --> 01:15:58,260
I just wanted to say thanks
for saving the day.

1106
01:15:58,667 --> 01:16:00,101
Yeah, who would've thought?

1107
01:16:00,102 --> 01:16:03,765
Zero to hero,
even if it was just for a few minutes.

1108
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:06,464
Looks like you made some friends.

1109
01:16:06,542 --> 01:16:08,976
Look, you don't have to be nice
to me now.

1110
01:16:08,977 --> 01:16:11,612
I wasn't going to, it's just...

1111
01:16:11,613 --> 01:16:13,247
I'm glad I told you my secret...

1112
01:16:13,248 --> 01:16:15,350
...instead of Massie.

1113
01:16:15,351 --> 01:16:18,052
Kris, could use your help back here.

1114
01:16:18,053 --> 01:16:20,288
After all, you are Glambition's president.

1115
01:16:20,289 --> 01:16:22,450
This was all your idea.

1116
01:16:23,192 --> 01:16:24,826
KRISTEN:
I guess I'll see you around.

1117
01:16:24,827 --> 01:16:26,760
Yeah. See you.

1118
01:16:30,065 --> 01:16:33,201
So I'm thinking...

1119
01:16:33,202 --> 01:16:37,536
...oatmeal flavor might be a bestseller.

1120
01:16:43,779 --> 01:16:45,813
MAN 1:
Yes. Oh, hey, how are you?

1121
01:16:45,814 --> 01:16:49,417
It's good to see you. Thanks for coming.

1122
01:16:49,418 --> 01:16:52,250
WOMAN:
I'm so sorry.

1123
01:16:52,654 --> 01:16:55,022
Oh, beautiful. Great to see you.

1124
01:16:55,023 --> 01:16:56,557
How are you?

1125
01:16:56,558 --> 01:16:59,549
Good to see you. All right, have fun.

1126
01:17:01,663 --> 01:17:04,825
MAN 2:
Very good. Very good.

1127
01:17:07,603 --> 01:17:09,593
Layne.

1128
01:17:09,938 --> 01:17:13,430
- Wow, you look awesome.
- Oh.

1129
01:17:13,475 --> 01:17:16,043
Does everyone party like this
in Westchester?

1130
01:17:16,044 --> 01:17:19,911
Well, no one throws a party
like the Blocks.

1131
01:17:20,015 --> 01:17:21,215
Oh, hey.

1132
01:17:21,216 --> 01:17:22,550
Hey.

1133
01:17:22,551 --> 01:17:23,985
CLAIRE:
Hey, happy birthday.

1134
01:17:23,986 --> 01:17:26,387
Thanks.
Claire, this is my girlfriend, Fawn.

1135
01:17:26,388 --> 01:17:28,189
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

1136
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:29,590
- Hey, Fawn.
- Hi.

1137
01:17:29,591 --> 01:17:33,219
- All right, we'll see you guys later.
- Bye.

1138
01:17:34,163 --> 01:17:35,530
Wow.

1139
01:17:35,531 --> 01:17:37,465
Not even Massie could compete with her.

1140
01:17:37,466 --> 01:17:39,133
She's beautiful.

1141
01:17:39,134 --> 01:17:40,768
Yeah.

1142
01:17:40,769 --> 01:17:44,170
Speaking of Massie...

1143
01:17:44,306 --> 01:17:46,407
It looks so awesome.

1144
01:17:49,011 --> 01:17:50,445
MASSIE:
Ta-da!

1145
01:17:50,446 --> 01:17:52,513
ALICIA:
Oh, my God. Where'd you get that?

1146
01:17:52,514 --> 01:17:54,015
- That's so cute.
- Really cute.

1147
01:17:54,016 --> 01:17:55,383
KRISTEN:
You look amazing.

1148
01:17:55,384 --> 01:17:57,919
Yeah, Chris Babely
is seriously gonna freak.

1149
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:01,055
A hundred dollars says tonight
you're getting your first kiss.

1150
01:18:01,056 --> 01:18:03,387
And maybe my second and third too.

1151
01:18:03,959 --> 01:18:05,393
ALICIA:
Oh, my God. That's too cute.

1152
01:18:05,394 --> 01:18:06,994
That's adorable. Oh, my God.

1153
01:18:06,995 --> 01:18:10,264
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1154
01:18:10,265 --> 01:18:15,566
And sold for $ 15,000. Thank you.

1155
01:18:17,873 --> 01:18:20,773
I wish we could bid on something.

1156
01:18:20,843 --> 01:18:24,608
Think there will be anything
that goes for under 20 bucks?

1157
01:18:25,247 --> 01:18:26,647
Oh, hey.

1158
01:18:26,648 --> 01:18:28,950
MRS. BLOCK:
We'll start the bidding at $ 12,000.

1159
01:18:28,951 --> 01:18:30,985
Still no Massie.

1160
01:18:30,986 --> 01:18:34,555
Maybe the wicked witch of Westchester
is dead.

1161
01:18:34,556 --> 01:18:36,956
I'll be right back.

1162
01:18:37,092 --> 01:18:39,093
CLAIRE:
Alicia, these are yours.

1163
01:18:39,094 --> 01:18:40,294
The dresses.

1164
01:18:40,295 --> 01:18:42,430
My parents thought
I should give them back.

1165
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:44,799
And your cell phone's in there too.

1166
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,735
By the way,
nice job trying to oust Massie.

1167
01:18:47,736 --> 01:18:49,504
You got closer than I ever did.

1168
01:18:49,505 --> 01:18:54,709
MRS. BLOCK:
Sold for $ 17,500 to the lucky lady.

1169
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:56,404
- Thank you.
CLAIRE: Hey, Dylan.

1170
01:18:56,645 --> 01:18:59,380
For what it's worth,
you would've rocked that miniskirt.

1171
01:18:59,381 --> 01:19:01,282
MRS. BLOCK:
Before we wrap up our auction...

1172
01:19:01,283 --> 01:19:03,216
Thanks.

1173
01:19:03,285 --> 01:19:05,152
MRS. BLOCK:
Please save some room for dessert...

1174
01:19:05,153 --> 01:19:06,687
Where's Massie?

1175
01:19:06,688 --> 01:19:09,023
- because we have
a very special birthday presentation.

1176
01:19:09,024 --> 01:19:11,458
Chris Abeley, this one's for you.

1177
01:19:27,509 --> 01:19:29,877
CLAIRE: I think it'd be nice if someone...
- What the...?

1178
01:19:29,878 --> 01:19:33,814
...said a few words about Chris.
- Claire Lyons, I'm gonna kill you!

1179
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:37,485
I think I'd like Fawn, Chris's girlfriend...

1180
01:19:37,486 --> 01:19:38,819
...to please come up.

1181
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:41,345
Chris's girlfriend, Fawn, come up here.

1182
01:19:43,725 --> 01:19:47,058
Fawn? Girlfriend?

1183
01:19:49,298 --> 01:19:50,665
Um...

1184
01:19:50,666 --> 01:19:53,234
I really don't know what to say.

1185
01:19:53,235 --> 01:19:56,470
Chris and I met back in the seventh grade,
you know.

1186
01:19:56,471 --> 01:20:00,429
- I wasn't really that interested...
CLAIRE: Massie, it's safe to come out now.

1187
01:20:00,475 --> 01:20:03,177
FAWN:
I was like, whoa.

1188
01:20:03,178 --> 01:20:04,478
He has a girlfriend?

1189
01:20:04,479 --> 01:20:07,381
FAWN: When he didn't hit me in the face
with a dodge ball...

1190
01:20:07,382 --> 01:20:08,849
...I knew he was the one.

1191
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:10,551
Happy birthday, babe.

1192
01:20:10,552 --> 01:20:13,077
I love you.

1193
01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:17,883
I think I'm gonna barf.

1194
01:20:24,433 --> 01:20:28,596
Is it possible to actually die
of embarrassment?

1195
01:20:28,604 --> 01:20:32,130
If it were, I'd be dead a long time ago.

1196
01:20:36,878 --> 01:20:39,747
They fall off all the time, the charms.

1197
01:20:39,748 --> 01:20:41,616
Mm-hm.

1198
01:20:41,617 --> 01:20:43,451
MASSIE:
Um...

1199
01:20:43,452 --> 01:20:46,554
Thanks, you know,
for helping me back there.

1200
01:20:46,555 --> 01:20:48,716
You didn't have to do that.

1201
01:20:49,424 --> 01:20:51,357
I know.

1202
01:20:51,793 --> 01:20:54,495
Then why did you?

1203
01:20:54,496 --> 01:20:56,554
Because I'm not you.

1204
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:00,935
That was you, right,
who sent the oatmeal text?

1205
01:21:00,936 --> 01:21:02,603
Yeah.

1206
01:21:02,604 --> 01:21:03,871
Why?

1207
01:21:03,872 --> 01:21:06,738
You could've been the hero.
Why'd you let me?

1208
01:21:06,975 --> 01:21:09,176
I don't know. I wanted to.

1209
01:21:09,177 --> 01:21:13,214
Come on, what about all the other times
you've tried to make my life miserable?

1210
01:21:13,215 --> 01:21:14,582
You don't get it, Claire.

1211
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:16,484
You're right, I don't.

1212
01:21:16,485 --> 01:21:19,887
Look how quickly my friends
were willing to ditch me for you.

1213
01:21:19,888 --> 01:21:23,084
Yeah, so, what,
you have to be mean to me?

1214
01:21:23,592 --> 01:21:28,153
I mean, come on.
You're, like, a major threat.

1215
01:21:30,432 --> 01:21:35,102
Me? To who, you?

1216
01:21:35,103 --> 01:21:37,833
Are you kidding me?

1217
01:21:38,106 --> 01:21:41,097
Hey, the singing stopped.

1218
01:21:42,177 --> 01:21:44,445
Well, I better go find the girls.

1219
01:21:44,446 --> 01:21:47,210
It's not really a party without me.

1220
01:21:47,349 --> 01:21:50,584
This is going to sound totally weird,
but can I take your picture?

1221
01:21:50,585 --> 01:21:52,643
It's for my brother.

1222
01:21:52,721 --> 01:21:55,656
How can you two be related?
He's such a little creep.

1223
01:21:55,657 --> 01:21:57,522
I know.

1224
01:22:06,334 --> 01:22:08,035
Here.

1225
01:22:08,036 --> 01:22:10,936
And for the record, I'd pick A too.

1226
01:22:11,173 --> 01:22:12,697
What's A-2?

1227
01:22:13,208 --> 01:22:15,009
I'd rather be a friendless loser...

1228
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:18,104
...than have a bunch of friends
who secretly hate me.

1229
01:23:11,099 --> 01:23:12,827
Did you have fun tonight?

1230
01:23:12,934 --> 01:23:14,731
Actually, I did.

1231
01:23:15,203 --> 01:23:16,937
Who gave you the flower?

1232
01:23:16,938 --> 01:23:19,235
Believe it or not, Massie did.

1233
01:23:19,808 --> 01:23:22,936
Not sure how long it'll last,
but I'm hoping for a while.

1234
01:23:23,145 --> 01:23:26,239
Are you talking about the flower
or Massie?

1235
01:23:26,915 --> 01:23:28,609
Both.

1236
01:27:46,207 --> 01:27:48,698
