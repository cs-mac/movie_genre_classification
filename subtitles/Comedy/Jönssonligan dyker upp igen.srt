1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,993
I have founded my philosophy on
nothing - except myself. Max Stirner

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:19,349
Of nothing comes nothing
- except lint. Storm P.

3
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:40,558
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE

4
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,710
Hi.

5
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,034
- Hi.
- You were home late last night.

6
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,230
- What?
- What?

7
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,709
What?

8
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,319
Do you know what this is?

9
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,071
- A picture?
- Come on, what do you think?

10
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,755
It's our little son.
His name is Serge.

11
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,319
Hi. Your name's Serge?

12
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,914
Yes, his name's Serge.

13
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,429
- What if he doesn't like us?
- He will.

14
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,114
Don't you think?

15
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,550
- Are you crying? Don't cry.
- I'm not.

16
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,712
I'm just happy.

17
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,998
As soon as we get the final papers,
we can go and get him.

18
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,638
Are you okay?

19
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,872
Tell me.

20
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,871
Håkon needs the script by Friday,
or he'll throw a fit.

21
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,918
You'll finish it in time.

22
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,152
Write one of the stories that hurt.
I know you can.

23
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,839
What the hell is the story?

24
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,473
<i>We're going to make a movie,</i>
<i>we're going to make a movie...</i>

25
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,238
<i>... a movie about a war.</i>

26
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,509
- Hi.
- What are you doing?

27
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,878
- Shouldn't you be in class?
- In an hour.

28
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,878
- Can I come in?
- Sure.

29
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,314
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks.

30
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,878
This is not happening!

31
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,238
- Pretend we're not here.
- He's still there.

32
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,671
- We don't open until 11.
- Are you Ali?

33
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,276
- Yes, I'm Ali.
- Niels Finsen.

34
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,989
- Military Intelligence.
- Hello.

35
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,152
- Can I talk to you for a moment?
- Sure. Come into the kitchen.

36
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,993
Thanks.

37
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,390
- Coffee?
- Please.

38
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,912
Have a seat.

39
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,751
You've given up your studies?

40
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,072
- Just this semester.
- Okay.

41
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,353
- To be a plumber?
- Yeah, well... My dad worked here.

42
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,355
It's a good idea to get away from
the books and get a taste of real life.

43
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,432
That's why I'm here.

44
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,799
We know you from your time
as a conscript and got interested -

45
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,636
- when we heard
you were studying Persian.

46
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,076
- You speak Farsi?
- Yes. And Arabic.

47
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,953
- You're a Muslim?
- Yes.

48
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,509
Could you be a little more specific?

49
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,116
We'd like you to sign up again.

50
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,840
As an interpreter.

51
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,835
Six months
of active duty to begin with.

52
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,835
You'd make an ideal
language officer.

53
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,310
That means I'm going to war? When?

54
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,472
Whenever you can. Now, preferably.

55
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,349
But just as an interpreter.
We'll protect you.

56
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,352
We need people
with your skills right now.

57
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,629
Think it over a day or two,
and I'll get back in touch.

58
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,918
- Have a good day.
- I'll be in touch, Ali. Thanks.

59
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,833
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.

60
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,310
I was just headhunted.

61
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,916
It will be fine.

62
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,115
Here are the pictures from Thomas.
They look good.

63
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,590
- Hi, Håkon.
- Hi, Jacob.

64
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,232
- And the script is...
- What?

65
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,796
You'll have it finished by Friday?

66
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,676
Stop it.

67
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,593
I need to know one thing.

68
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,435
I need to hear you say
you're with me on this.

69
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,313
- What?
- It's just a movie, Jacob.

70
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:09,396
No! If it were just a movie,
it would all be rather pointless.

71
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,120
Don't you think?

72
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,193
- Don't start tripping on me again.
- Tripping on you?

73
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,478
- I'm just saying...
- How do you mean, tripping?

74
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,474
- What do you mean by that?
- If you don't know, it doesn't matter.

75
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,438
- So now it doesn't matter?
- No... Let's just...

76
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,149
You want to talk about this, or what?

77
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,199
I want us to run through
the final locations tomorrow.

78
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,593
- Sure. We have a deal.
- We have a deal, yes.

79
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,554
See you tomorrow.

80
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,592
Håkon. Hey!

81
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,834
Hey... hey!

82
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,553
Are you okay?

83
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,917
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

84
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,917
Damn it!

85
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,517
Come here.

86
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,275
Can you hear me?

87
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,394
I'm going to get help.

88
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,951
I will get some help.
I will get some help.

89
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,709
I'll be right back. I just need to...

90
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,753
Get my bag.

91
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,072
Get my bag out of here!

92
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,110
I'll get you out of here.

93
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,720
Damn it!

94
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,310
I want to report that a man's been
run over on Holmbrovej in Ramløse.

95
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,597
It doesn't look good. Hurry.

96
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,229
- Helena, we're going back to town.
- What?

97
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,075
- We're going back to town.
- What's up?

98
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,477
What's going on?
Hey, what the hell is going on?

99
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,518
- What's going on?
- I just need to go to town.

100
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,150
- Why?
- I've got early meetings tomorrow.

101
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,075
- Did you have a good day?
- Probably not as exciting as yours.

102
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,472
I've been packing for you
and for me and for Serge.

103
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,953
- This is crazy. You're miles away.
- I'm not.

104
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,118
- What's wrong?
- Everything's fine.

105
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,034
- You're keeping something from me.
- Everything's fine.

106
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,557
- Did you have a good day?
- What?

107
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,191
- Tell me about it.
- I'm looking forward to the adoption.

108
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,431
- So am I.
- You're sure you've got time for that?

109
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,396
Did you pick up the adoption papers
at the State Administration Office?

110
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,439
- They're coming tomorrow.
- Promise me to take care of it?

111
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,831
- I promise.
- Good.

112
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,830
Hold me.

113
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,753
You do know
you're the woman of my dreams?

114
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,794
So what happens to me
when you wake up?

115
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,398
Hey there, beautiful. We're here.

116
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,393
Where are we?

117
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,079
- At the hotel.
- Okay.

118
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,919
Will you wait for me?

119
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,671
What do you think?

120
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,518
What are you doing in there?

121
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,830
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'll be right out.

122
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,594
Come on.

123
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,592
In here.

124
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,712
We're going to do it in here.

125
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,076
Wait here, and we'll be right in.

126
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,709
- We're renovating. Sorry.
- What's going on?

127
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,190
I've been traveling for 48 hours,
and I want to go home.

128
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,113
Please sit down.

129
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,190
This is a confidentiality agreement -

130
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,070
- and the doctor's certificate stating
you were sent home due to illness.

131
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,392
You are not allowed to breathe a word
about your stay at the Danish camp.

132
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,190
The sentence for leaking
secrets of state is up to 12 years.

133
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,148
- I'm not ill.
- You hurt your shoulder.

134
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,313
And your work at the camp
has made you mentally unstable.

135
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,553
It's perfectly normal.

136
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,430
Sign here and here.

137
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,229
And then you get to go home.

138
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,196
Now we'd like to take a look
at your bag.

139
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,789
- What's this?
- My diary.

140
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,872
Anything documenting your stay
at the camp is to be handed over to us.

141
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,555
Well, except these tourist snaps.

142
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,759
It looks like you had fun.

143
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,274
- Anything else?
- No.

144
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,159
Stand up, please.

145
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,274
Empty your pockets, please.

146
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,669
Welcome home.

147
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:41,678
Everything will be fine.
I promise.

148
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,989
- Hi. Is Siri Falk in her office?
- She just walked by here.

149
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,639
- Hi, Siri.
- Hi, Jacob.

150
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,634
- Do you have a moment?
- Sure. How are you?

151
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,436
Long time no see, little brother.

152
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,160
- Have you got a couple of minutes?
- Sure.

153
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,316
- Anything wrong?
- I've got something to show you.

154
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,913
- Promise me not to tell a soul.
- Sure.

155
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,674
- Do we have a deal?
- Sure.

156
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,877
- Do we?
- God, you're annoying.

157
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,759
Yes, we have a deal.

158
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,793
Can I touch it?

159
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,552
Let's go up here
where we can be alone.

160
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,476
- Can I open it now?
- Yes, go ahead.

161
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,473
What is this?

162
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,038
Danish soldiers?
Where did you get these?

163
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,752
- I found them near the cottage.
- How did you find them?

164
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,196
- It's a long story.
- And a very important one.

165
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,397
What consequences could they have?

166
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:58,475
Jacob, do you live in the real world,
or are you completely self-absorbed?

167
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,029
- What?
- Do you read the newspapers?

168
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,237
With the election coming up,
if these photos were to come out...

169
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,837
Photos of Danish soldiers committing
atrocities. I can't look at them.

170
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,036
Good.

171
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,232
Good?

172
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,669
Whose are they?
Where did you get them?

173
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,628
- I just came by them.
- Christ, where did you get them?

174
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,429
- I'm trying to help get them out.
- Help who?

175
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,195
- Are you in trouble?
- No! I'm trying to do something.

176
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,349
- This is too dangerous.
- What do you mean?

177
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,752
I bet others would like to get
their hands on these photos.

178
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,558
I'll give them to the news staff,
and they'll look into it.

179
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,951
No, I found them.
Are you trying to take them?

180
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,758
Stop it!

181
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,959
You come asking me for help at work,
and then you behave like that!

182
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:05,194
- I found them, I'll handle it.
- Great, bye. You go handle it.

183
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,234
I know this reporter Michael.
He's covered the war for ages.

184
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,676
Give them to him,
and he'll get the ball rolling.

185
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,277
- Is he trustworthy?
- Would I vouch for him, if he weren't?

186
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,159
Give me his number then.

187
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,476
Thanks.

188
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,635
What's up?
We're all waiting for you.

189
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,951
- Manuel, what do you think?
- It's great.

190
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,237
Sune, switch off the work lights.

191
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,272
- Perfect.
- Great. We're ready to shoot here.

192
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,558
- Let's go scout the airport.
- I have another appointment now.

193
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,110
- Tor is waiting for us at the airport.
- I can't.

194
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:11,638
- It's not up for discussion. Let's go.
- Manuel can do this on his own.

195
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:16,590
- Don't take off. Where are you going?
- To talk to someone about the script.

196
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,876
- Do it here.
- No.

197
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,549
Fuck!

198
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,355
Hi.

199
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,798
Is everything okay?

200
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,675
Jacob?

201
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,274
- Hi.
- Hi.

202
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,830
- Michael.
- Thanks for coming.

203
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,358
- Odd place, this.
- I just happened to pass by, so...

204
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,196
- You know Siri?
- Sure. From Journalism School.

205
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:41,036
We bump into each other
now and then. It's a small world.

206
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,068
You had something for me,
she said.

207
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,515
I've got some photos that...
I think you ought to see.

208
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,438
Just... Look.

209
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,036
The Danish flag?
Where did you get these?

210
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,637
- Who took them?
- I can't tell you that part right now.

211
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,911
- I suppose you want me to print them.
- That's the idea.

212
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,677
I need to know more.
I have to be 120% sure they're real.

213
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,479
Sure. What do you need?

214
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,509
I'd really like to talk to the guy
who took them. Is that possible?

215
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:46,470
- Is he in Denmark?
- Yes. I don't know where.

216
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,791
- But I guess I could find out.
- Do that.

217
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,116
What will happen to the guy?

218
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,033
I don't know. Is he afraid?

219
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,715
- No. Those photos have to get out.
- Damn right.

220
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,471
If I can get them verified,
we're going to print them.

221
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,954
- You don't want me to keep them?
- No, I'd better hold on to them.

222
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,598
POLICE

223
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,269
How can I help you?

224
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,637
I'm here about
a car accident last night.

225
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,872
I'll get someone who can help you.

226
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:58,628
This is the desk sergeant.
A man wants to know...

227
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,273
- Charlotte.
- Jacob Falk.

228
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,317
- This won't take long.
- It's fine. Sit down.

229
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,754
- What is this about?
- A car accident last night.

230
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,550
- Where and when?
- About 3. Holmbrovej in Ramløse.

231
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,953
I just want to know how the man is
doing, and I'd like to see him.

232
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,272
- What's your role in the case?
- My role?

233
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,639
- Do you know the injured party?
- No.

234
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,277
Then I can't pass on
that kind of information.

235
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,956
I just want to talk to him.
Oh, is it because I'm not related?

236
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,476
- Yes.
- Well, I am related.

237
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:08,475
- You are? In what way?
- I...

238
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,315
- I was driving the car.
- What car?

239
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,314
I ran him over.

240
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,677
- What's up?
- Hit-and-run from last night.

241
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,957
- But he hasn't reported it until now.
- I called.

242
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:30,240
Well, belated good morals are better
than no morals at all.

243
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,598
- Why didn't you turn up sooner?
- I just want to talk to him.

244
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,914
- Time and place of the accident?
- Just after 3 last night.

245
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,038
Holmbrovej in Ramløse.

246
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,558
We sent an ambulance and
a patrol car, but no victim was found.

247
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,349
What?

248
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:59,389
- That's what we call a false alarm.
- No, it wasn't a false alarm.

249
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,349
No reports have been made
from any hospitals in the region.

250
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,512
- Who went to the scene?
- Kenneth.

251
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,911
- Let me speak to Kenneth then.
- No, that's impossible.

252
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,355
- Impossible?
- Impossible.

253
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,711
Let's wrap it up here.

254
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,516
- You're hiding something from me.
- Goodbye.

255
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,752
- Thank you for your time!
- This way, please.

256
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,596
- Hi. Are you Kenneth?
- What are you doing in here?

257
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,470
Kenneth? Your colleague said you
went to the car accident last night.

258
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,078
- Yes. Who are you?
- Jacob Falk. What happened?

259
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,313
I can't tell you. You can't be
in here. You have to leave.

260
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,631
I had the misfortune to hit the man.

261
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,236
- What man?
- The man who was run over.

262
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,157
Did your colleague just tell you
to keep quiet?

263
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,313
I don't know what you're playing at,
but I want you to leave this area.

264
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,429
Were you just ordered to keep quiet?
You did go to the scene, right?

265
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,798
- Did the military tell you to shut up?
- Goodbye.

266
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,432
Why did you return so soon?

267
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,559
Because I saw something
I shouldn't have seen.

268
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,190
And so they sent me home.

269
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,552
What's going to happen now?

270
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,871
I don't know.

271
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,435
- Yes.
<i>- It's Michael. Did you find him?</i>

272
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,875
No. It's strange...
I haven't found him.

273
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,429
<i>- Damn!</i>
- I have one more place to check.

274
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,991
<i>My editor and I have decided to have</i>
<i>an expert examine the pictures.</i>

275
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,789
<i>- If he okays them, we'll print them.</i>
- Great.

276
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,317
<i>Can we meet tomorrow?</i>
<i>Say at The Polar Bear at 11?</i>

277
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,711
- Why not at the paper?
<i>- Want to keep this a secret?</i>

278
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,509
<i>Then we'll do it my way.</i>
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

279
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,918
Hello?

280
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,633
Is anybody there?

281
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,913
- Jacob.
- Lemmy.

282
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,071
What on earth are you doing here?

283
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,874
- Is anything wrong?
- Lemmy...

284
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:48,711
- Where's Ali?
- Who?

285
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,429
You don't know Ali? You did notice
the broken window, didn't you?

286
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,672
Yes, and I've called the glazier.

287
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,833
- Cut the crap, Lemmy.
- What?

288
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,357
You want to help him, and so do I.
It's fine! I need to talk to him.

289
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:12,678
- When did you ever help anyone?
- Well, I'm trying to now.

290
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,628
You can only help yourself, but
you're not much good at that either.

291
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,074
Do you want me to call your sister?

292
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:30,030
No.
Sorry I bothered you.

293
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,078
Hey, stop!

294
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,349
Not the photos,
not the photos, not the photos.

295
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,512
Shit!

296
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,676
Helena?

297
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,438
- Helena!
- You frightened the life out of me.

298
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,319
Relax.

299
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:47,038
- Sorry, I just thought...
- What's wrong?

300
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,954
- Nothing... Nothing.
- What did you think?

301
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,715
I didn't think anything. Sorry.

302
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,233
You always do this.

303
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:08,793
You always get obsessed with
your movies, and then you can't see...

304
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,274
... anything else.

305
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:32,311
Everything I do, I do for you.

306
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,948
Yeah...

307
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,435
Helena...

308
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:50,800
If you love me that much, I assume
you got the adoption papers?

309
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:56,153
I will get them tomorrow.
Tomorrow.

310
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:17,075
THE POLAR BEAR

311
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,949
- Is everything okay?
- Someone broke into my car.

312
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,078
- That doesn't sound good.
- They stole the photos.

313
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,028
Are you serious?
Did you call the police?

314
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,749
I don't know, if I can trust the police.

315
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:47,040
- Who have you told about all this?
- My editor. No one else at the paper.

316
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,317
- Someone must've talked.
- Well, not me.

317
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,792
I can keep my mouth shut.
I do it for a living. Okay?

318
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,556
- Any idea who it might be?
- No... The military perhaps.

319
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,156
I haven't got a clue.

320
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:19,234
I've got a diary that probably belongs
to the guy who took the photos. Ali.

321
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:25,150
Well, that's something.
My contacts might be able to help us.

322
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,117
Listen.

323
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,512
Before you do anything else,
get yourself a new SIM card.

324
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,990
Text your new number
to this number.

325
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,391
And I'll call you back.

326
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,438
That way we can talk
without being monitored.

327
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,274
Talk to you later.

328
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,034
- Michael...
- Yes.

329
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,953
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

330
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,916
They didn't find them.

331
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,836
- I hate you.
- I'm sorry.

332
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,557
I have to go away. Alone.

333
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,398
I know where you can go.

334
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,360
- Yes?
<i>- Where the hell are you?</i>

335
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,398
- In town.
<i>- What are you doing?</i>

336
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,757
- It's a long story.
<i>- I've got time. Tell me.</i>

337
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,832
- I'm working.
<i>- I want the script on Friday.</i>

338
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,630
- I'm on it! I'm sorting out the story.
<i>- Just work on the movie!</i>

339
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,914
Yes?

340
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:00,914
<i>I've found a soldier who spent</i>
<i>the past six months down there.</i>

341
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,878
<i>- We can see him later today.</i>
- When?

342
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:09,114
<i>Pick me up at the metro at 3,</i>
<i>and we'll take it from there.</i>

343
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:28,913
- Hi. Impressive.
- Wasn't it?

344
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:34,029
- Where was he posted?
- Rasmus? Camp Viking.

345
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,875
- Good.
- Why?

346
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,600
Ali was at Camp Viking too.

347
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,918
That red car is tailing us.

348
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:00,432
- Sure?
- He changes lanes when we do.

349
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,312
What do we do? I haven't tried
this kind of thing before.

350
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,117
- Yes?
- Hello. Michael Jelling.

351
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,354
- This is a colleague of mine, Jacob.
- Come in.

352
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:50,677
- Outside. The kids are asleep.
- Fine.

353
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,078
- You were there recently, right?
- Yes, for six months.

354
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,471
I came back three weeks ago.

355
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,872
- How many were you?
- At our camp we were about 200.

356
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,795
- Your camp was Camp Viking?
- Yes.

357
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:21,113
- Were you a tight-knit group?
- I'd say that.

358
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,636
- You knew most of them?
- Yes.

359
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,076
- Do you know a soldier called Ali?
- He was an interpreter.

360
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:32,950
- Not a soldier. A civilian interpreter.
- I don't know anyone by that name.

361
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:37,557
- Maybe he used another name.
- No.

362
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:40,393
- You don't know him?
- No.

363
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:48,315
- Did any interpreters get into trouble?
- How do you mean?

364
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,917
- Was anyone sent home before time?
- Not that I know of.

365
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:58,154
- You didn't hear about any problems?
- No.

366
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:02,233
- Sure, life at the camp was carefree.
- Jacob, calm down.

367
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,915
He's answering our questions,
isn't he?

368
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,836
Hang on.

369
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,990
Excuse me. Michael speaking.

370
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,072
- Why don't you admit you know Ali?
- Because I don't.

371
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,357
I could tell right away
that you know Ali.

372
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,274
And I could tell
you weren't going to admit it.

373
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,749
How much are they paying you
to shut up?

374
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,835
- I don't know what you're on about.
- So you won't say a thing?

375
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,549
You have to live with this. Can you
look your kids in the eye after this?

376
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,473
- Shut your mouth.
- Oh yeah?

377
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:48,668
- Yes, shut your mouth.
- Are you in the photos? Is that it?

378
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,877
- You're in deep shit.
- What's your problem?

379
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:56,830
- You have to live with this forever.
- You've got a problem. Piss off!

380
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:07,871
- We've wasted two hours on this!
- What happened?

381
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:13,068
- Jacob, wait.
- It's so obvious. Who pays Rasmus?

382
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:16,198
The military.
Of course he's lying about Ali!

383
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:20,114
- My contact vouched for him.
- And he's trustworthy?

384
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,918
- Says who?
- I do.

385
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,116
- And who are you?
- What?

386
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,192
Who are you? After I met you,
the photos get stolen -

387
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:31,592
- and then you take me to a guy who's
out to convince me Ali doesn't exist.

388
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,072
- Who do you work for?
- I'm not listening to this. No way!

389
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,549
I did this as a favor to Siri.

390
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,633
- I used my contacts to help...
- Find you own way home.

391
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,553
Take the train.

392
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,674
Where the hell have you been?

393
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,678
Did you finish the script?
Let me see.

394
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:10,231
Hands off.
You'll get your copy on Friday.

395
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:15,074
- Here they are. When did this come?
- What?

396
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,711
It's the adoption papers
I've been waiting for.

397
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,394
What are you talking about?

398
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,751
They've made a mistake.

399
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:38,353
This guy Karl Nyhansen has...
It's filled out wrong on purpose.

400
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,431
It's the adoption papers.

401
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:44,115
Imagine the consequences,
if I hadn't noticed.

402
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,510
It's so clear to me now.

403
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:54,036
- They want me to let Helena down.
- Calm down.

404
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,909
They're trying to ruin me,
because I'm trying to ruin their war.

405
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,833
- Where are you going?
- I've got more important things to do!

406
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,278
Come back, and let's talk
about this in a civil way. Jacob!

407
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:09,591
I'm going to shut down the movie!

408
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,630
THE STATE ADMINISTRATION

409
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:32,673
So we have
to examine the case again.

410
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:36,435
I need to talk to Karl Nyhansen.
Excuse me. Karl Nyhansen.

411
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:40,275
- Have you got an appointment?
- Appointment?

412
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,352
- Yes.
- No, I need to see him now.

413
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:48,071
- You'll have to take a number.
- He knows I'm coming!

414
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:52,279
If you don't have an appointment,
you have to take a number.

415
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:56,672
- You misunderstand. Let me talk...
- I understand perfectly.

416
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:02,358
- Take a number. The procedure...
- I need to talk to Karl Nyhansen!

417
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,592
Nyhansen!

418
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,748
- Hey there.
- Nyhansen!

419
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:17,755
- Can I help you? Calm down now.
- Can't I talk to Karl Nyhansen?

420
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,356
- You have to go to the reception.
- Why is that door locked?

421
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:26,389
Why are you touching me?
Because you work for the state, right?

422
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:30,633
The state has got a monopoly on
violence. What's behind that door?

423
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:34,713
- You have to follow the rules.
- I'm perfectly calm.

424
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,953
- I told you not to go in there.
- I'm perfectly calm. Relax!

425
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:43,113
Can't I talk to my friend here?

426
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,271
- Hi.
- Hi. What are you doing here?

427
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:59,639
I just want to talk to you.
Let's go in there. I'm freezing.

428
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,355
- Have you got anything hot to drink?
- Coffee.

429
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:13,159
Two black coffees.

430
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,636
Come and sit down.

431
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:26,432
- What's that? It looks...
- I bumped my head getting in the car.

432
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:31,310
- What happened? It's deep.
- It's just a scratch.

433
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,517
Why are you looking at me like that?

434
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,752
- I love you.
- I love you too.

435
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,639
Sweetie pie.

436
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,190
- Håkon called me. He's worried.
- Håkon called you?

437
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,476
- I got worried.
- Don't be.

438
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,030
When people worry about
my kid brother, I come running.

439
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,430
I'm fine.

440
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:03,390
He said you're going to start
shooting soon. That's great.

441
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:06,996
- Is that stressing you out?
- No, it's great.

442
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,993
Lovely. Thanks.

443
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,553
Siri, I'm in kind of a hurry.

444
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:19,474
I thought it would do you good
to chat with your big sister.

445
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,392
Look...

446
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:25,109
I ended up shouting at Håkon,
but I'll talk it out with him. I'm fine.

447
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,195
- What? I'm telling you, I'm fine.
- I don't believe you.

448
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,239
- You don't believe me?
- I know you. I can tell you're not.

449
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,393
Stop pretending to care about me.
We gave that up long ago.

450
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:43,395
I'm not pretending.
I'm really worried about you.

451
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:51,109
Is it the photos? Something tells me
they're stressing you out.

452
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,470
Did Michael ask you to talk to me?

453
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:59,030
- Why do you think that?
- Because he wants to stop this story.

454
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:04,228
Michael is a reporter and as such
obliged to check if the photos are real.

455
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,029
- You've talked to him?
- Sure. That story could have been...

456
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:12,239
Could have been?
It is... a huge story!

457
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,437
The state has endless funds
and a monopoly on violence.

458
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,672
Think about it. Why am I crazy?

459
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:22,150
- You sound like a conspiracy lunatic.
- Okay, so now I'm a lunatic.

460
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:25,869
I don't have time for this.
I need to find the mastermind.

461
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:30,397
- Sit down.
- Why do you want me to sit down?

462
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,677
- Sit down.
- Are you involved?

463
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:38,231
Stop this nonsense.
What am I supposed to be involved in?

464
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,756
- Why are you keeping me here?
- Be quiet!

465
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:47,677
Why are you keeping me here?
Are they at the hotel? In my room?

466
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,719
- Are you supposed to keep me away?
- Sweetie, come back.

467
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:59,153
Helena.

468
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,636
No!

469
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,548
- Have you seen my wife leave?
- No.

470
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:16,792
- Maybe she was with a man.
- I haven't seen her.

471
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:25,829
Where is she?
Who are you working for?

472
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,673
- Papers!
- Where is my wife?

473
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:33,277
I deliver newspapers
morning and night.

474
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,755
Ali?

475
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,632
Ali?

476
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:20,038
Who...?
What are you doing here?

477
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:42,438
I love him.

478
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,672
Do you?

479
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,877
I won't say anything.

480
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,390
Oh, I think you will.

481
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,230
Can you hear me?

482
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,117
Where are they?
Where are Helena and Ali?

483
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:16,796
- Where are they?
- Who are you? What do you want?

484
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,077
I don't have time for this!

485
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,792
Dad, who are you talking to?
Who are you?

486
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,950
Go back to bed, sweetheart.

487
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:36,875
- I can't sleep.
- Go back to bed now!

488
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:42,034
- Take it easy!
- Nobody leaves until I find Helena.

489
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,838
Calm down.

490
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:50,589
Calm down.

491
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:02,390
Falk?

492
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,989
Jacob Falk.

493
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:12,518
It's all your fault.
You know that, don't you?

494
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:15,990
But you can't stop me now.
I'm going to get my son -

495
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:20,073
- and then I'll find Helena and Ali,
and then everything will make sense.

496
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:23,073
I understand, but...

497
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:26,357
Let's take it nice and easy.
Sit down.

498
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,398
Go back to bed.

499
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,119
It's okay. Go back to bed.

500
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:48,717
- Who is he?
- He's a man who's very unhappy.

501
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,278
Can I do anything?
I'd like to help you.

502
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:04,798
I can understand why you're upset.
Let me just take this.

503
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:11,877
Is there anyone I can call?

504
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:18,070
Have you got a phone?
Let me just check your pocket.

505
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:21,710
I'll call someone who knows you.

506
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:32,551
Good evening. Karl Nyhansen.
He's upstairs.

507
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:37,111
I work for the State Administration.
I did their paperwork for the adoption.

508
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:40,431
He's in here.

509
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,478
Hi, Jacob.

510
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,752
Jacob, darling.

511
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:53,634
What are you doing here?
Let's go home and work things out.

512
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,836
Let's go home.

513
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,232
Let's get some fresh air.

514
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,992
I'm sorry. Ouch.

515
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,468
I've really messed things up.

516
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:48,950
I've started something,
I can't control -

517
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:53,159
- and now someone needs me,
but I let him down.

518
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:01,715
- Are you lost in a story again?
- It's not my movie. The man exists.

519
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:05,395
His name's Ali, or so I think.
All I know is...

520
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:11,757
Because of me he's in deep trouble,
and now...

521
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,037
- Jacob...
- I've ruined it, like I always do.

522
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:20,230
I've just ruined everything.

523
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:25,474
Stop it. Please, Jacob.

524
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:36,037
I miss her so much.

525
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,788
I understand.

526
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:47,990
I understand, sweetheart.

527
01:15:56,160 --> 01:16:00,358
THE CZECH REPUBLIC
6 months earlier

528
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:43,909
- Hi.
- Good morning.

529
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:50,348
- Get any sleep?
- Not much.

530
01:16:56,040 --> 01:17:02,752
- I hope nothing goes wrong.
- What could go wrong?

531
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:07,550
It'd be just our luck to have something
go wrong at the very last minute.

532
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:12,794
Nothing is going to go wrong.
Very soon we'll have our son.

533
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,437
Don't worry. In a few hours we'll have
everything we ever dreamed about.

534
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:28,231
It's a big day.
How big?

535
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:32,518
- Very big. Huge.
- Huge.

536
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:36,116
- As huge as my nose?
- Almost.

537
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:53,313
We've got two hours left
to let our hair down -

538
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:58,508
- and be completely irresponsible
for the last time.

539
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:29,997
The clock is ticking. Now we've only
got 1 hour and 57 minutes left.

540
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:15,156
Have we got everything?
Check again.

541
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,076
- You forgot...?
- Two minutes.

542
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:24,236
Hurry up!

543
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:37,437
I've got it.

544
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,955
What's so interesting?

545
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:45,274
A civilian interpreter claims he
witnessed atrocities against prisoners.

546
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,628
Ready?

547
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,356
Damn, you look beautiful.

548
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:32,798
- We have to get off here.
- Now?

549
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:55,235
- Didn't you check them?
- Sure.

550
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:06,954
We'll work it out. It's just a delay.

551
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:43,838
The plane tickets can easily be...

552
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,912
Be what?

553
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:50,550
The plane tickets
can easily be altered.

554
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,195
Well, isn't that great?

555
01:23:56,080 --> 01:24:00,198
- I asked you to do this one thing.
- Yes.

556
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:04,358
- Just this one thing.
- Yes.

557
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:08,911
One single thing. You had
to make sure the papers were fine.

558
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:12,390
That's all you had to do.

559
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:16,109
But they aren't.

560
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:21,718
Didn't I ask you to check the papers?
Yes, but it's just not important to you.

561
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:25,759
- Yes, it is.
- No, then we would've had him now!

562
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:30,994
We should've had him! You didn't find
it important because of your work!

563
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:34,550
We should have had him now!
Do you hear?

564
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:39,555
He's waiting for us,
and we can't get him!

565
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:44,588
We should have had him now!

566
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:48,833
Don't touch me!
Don't you touch me!

567
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,915
Helena!

568
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:15,149
Helena!

569
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:11,476
Everything will be fine.
I promise.

570
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:41,518
