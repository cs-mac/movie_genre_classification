1
00:01:42,012 --> 00:01:48,466
On November 1, 1959, the population
of New York City was 8,042,783.

2
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:53,806
If you laid them all end to end, figuring
an average height of 5 feet 6 and half inches,...

3
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,984
..they would reach from Times Square
to the outskirts of Karachi, Pakistan.

4
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,523
I know facts like this because I work for
an insurance company, Consolidated Life.

5
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:05,194
We're one of the top five companies
in the country.

6
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:09,111
Our home office has 31,259 employees,...

7
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:13,575
..which is more than the entire population
of, uh... Natchez, Mississippi.

8
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:16,710
I work on the 19th floor.
Ordinary Policy Department,...

9
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:20,964
..Premium Accounting Division,
Section W, desk number 861.

10
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:26,134
My name is CC Baxter: C for Calvin, C for
Clifford. But most people call me Bud.

11
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:31,422
I've worked here three years, ten months,
and my take-home pay is $94.70 a week.

12
00:02:41,651 --> 00:02:44,854
The hours in our department
are 8.50 to 5.20.

13
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:47,026
(Bell)

14
00:02:49,825 --> 00:02:54,783
They're staggered by floor so 16 elevators
can handle the 31,259 employees...

15
00:02:54,913 --> 00:02:57,369
..without a serious traffic jam.

16
00:02:57,499 --> 00:03:02,660
As for myself, I very often stay on at the
office and work for an extra hour or two,...

17
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:04,872
..especially when the weather is bad.

18
00:03:05,007 --> 00:03:08,589
It's not that I'm overly ambitious.
It's just a way of killing time...

19
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:11,422
..until it's all right for me to go home.

20
00:03:11,553 --> 00:03:15,005
You see, I have this little problem
with my apartment.

21
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:19,850
I live in the West 60s,
just half a block from Central Park.

22
00:03:19,978 --> 00:03:23,145
My rent is $85 a month.
It used to be $80 until last July...

23
00:03:23,273 --> 00:03:27,186
..when Mrs. Lieberman, the landlady,
put in a second-hand air conditioner.

24
00:03:27,317 --> 00:03:32,989
It's a real nice apartment. Nothing fancy,
but kind of cozy. Just right for a bachelor.

25
00:03:33,116 --> 00:03:36,567
The only problem is
I can't always get in when I want to.

26
00:03:36,703 --> 00:03:39,158
(Latin-beat dance music)

27
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:46,498
(Woman hums along to music)

28
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,673
Cut it out, Sylvia.
We've gotta get out of here.

29
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:56,837
What's the panic?
I'm gonna have another martini.

30
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,129
Please, Sylvia. It's a quarter of nine.

31
00:03:59,264 --> 00:04:02,598
First you can't wait to get me here
and then it's rush, rush, rush.

32
00:04:02,727 --> 00:04:05,928
- Makes a person feel cheap.
- Sweetie, it's not that.

33
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:08,850
But I promised the guy
I'd be outta here by eight.

34
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:14,606
- What guy? Whose apartment is this?
- Some schnook that works in the office.

35
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,490
- Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
- Mrs. Lieberman.

36
00:04:30,628 --> 00:04:35,585
Some weather we're having. Must be from
all that meshugaas at Cape Canaveral.

37
00:04:36,924 --> 00:04:41,632
- You're locked out of your apartment?
- No, no. Just waiting for a friend.

38
00:04:42,179 --> 00:04:45,548
- Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
- Good night, Mr. Baxter.

39
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:06,160
- Where do you live?
- I told you. With my mother.

40
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:09,488
- Where does she live?
- 179th Street, in the Bronx.

41
00:05:09,622 --> 00:05:14,616
- All right. I'll take you to the subway.
- Like hell you will! You'll buy me a cab.

42
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:18,666
- Why do all you dames live in the Bronx?
- You bring other girls up here?

43
00:05:18,797 --> 00:05:21,667
Certainly not. I'm a happily married man.

44
00:06:01,003 --> 00:06:04,121
- Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
- Something's the matter?

45
00:06:04,255 --> 00:06:08,335
Uh, no. I... seem to have
dropped my key. Ah, here it is.

46
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:10,960
Such a racket I heard in your place.

47
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:13,217
Maybe you had burglars?

48
00:06:13,346 --> 00:06:17,808
Don't worry about that. There's nothing in
here anybody'd wanna steal. Good night.

49
00:06:49,046 --> 00:06:51,085
(Doorbell)

50
00:06:56,804 --> 00:07:01,347
Sorry to bother you, Buddy-boy,
but the little lady forgot her galoshes.

51
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:04,974
Mr. Kirkeby, you were supposed
to be outta here by eight.

52
00:07:05,104 --> 00:07:09,683
I know, but those things don't always
run on schedule like a Greyhound bus.

53
00:07:09,817 --> 00:07:12,484
I don't mind in the summer,
but on a rainy night...

54
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,280
- I haven't had any dinner yet.
- Sure, sure.

55
00:07:15,405 --> 00:07:17,444
Oh!

56
00:07:17,823 --> 00:07:20,990
I put in a good word for you
with Sheldrake in Personnel.

57
00:07:21,118 --> 00:07:22,696
- Mr. Sheldrake?
- That's right.

58
00:07:22,828 --> 00:07:26,777
We discussed manpower promotion-wise.
I told him you're a bright boy.

59
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:31,043
They're always on the lookout for
young executives. You're on your way up.

60
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:35,036
- And you're also out of liquor.
- Mr. Eichelberger, Mortgage and Loans...

61
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:39,634
- ..last night he had a Halloween party.
- Lay in some vodka and vermouth for me.

62
00:07:39,762 --> 00:07:44,055
- You still owe me for the last two bottles.
- I'll pay you on Friday.

63
00:07:44,182 --> 00:07:49,424
Oh, and whatever happened to those little
cheese crackers you used to have?

64
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:53,688
Cheese crackers?

65
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,098
Cheers.

66
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:53,025
- Good evening, Baxter.
- Hi, Doc. Had a late call?

67
00:08:53,162 --> 00:08:57,824
Yeah. Some clown at Schrafft's ate
a club sandwich - including the toothpick.

68
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:02,547
- Well, good night, Doc.
- Say, Baxter.

69
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:06,503
The way you're beltin' that stuff,
you must have cast-iron kidneys.

70
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:10,845
That's not me. Just once in a while
I have a few people in for a drink.

71
00:09:10,971 --> 00:09:14,055
As a matter of fact, you must be
an iron man all around.

72
00:09:14,182 --> 00:09:17,468
From what I hear through the walls,
you're at it every night.

73
00:09:17,602 --> 00:09:22,062
- I'm sorry if it gets noisy.
- And sometimes there's a double-header.

74
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:26,230
- (Tuts) A nebbish like you.
- Yeah. Well, I'll see you, Doc.

75
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,109
You know, I'm doing some research
at the Columbia Medical Center.

76
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:32,527
- Could you do us a favor?
- Me?

77
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:36,490
When you make out your will -
and the way you're going, you should -

78
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:40,700
would you mind leaving
your body to the university?

79
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:45,126
My body? I'm afraid you guys'd
be disappointed. Good night, Doc.

80
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,543
Slow down, kid.

81
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,122
Oh, for heaven...

82
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:41,218
From the world's greatest library
of film classics, we proudly present...

83
00:10:41,346 --> 00:10:43,752
..Greta Garbo, John Barrymore,...

84
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,017
..Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery
and Lionel Barrymore...

85
00:10:48,144 --> 00:10:50,896
..in "Grand Hotel".

86
00:10:51,688 --> 00:10:54,226
But first, a word from our sponsor.

87
00:10:54,358 --> 00:10:58,686
If you smoke the modern way,
don't be fooled by phony filter claims.

88
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:26,462
(Bugle: cavalry charge)

89
00:11:29,848 --> 00:11:32,637
And now, "Grand Hotel"...

90
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:35,555
..starring Greta Garbo, John Barrymore,...

91
00:11:35,688 --> 00:11:39,222
..Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery
and Lionel Barrymore.

92
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:43,689
But first, a word
from our alternate sponsor.

93
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:47,485
Friends, do you have wobbly dentures?

94
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:03,752
(Phone rings)

95
00:12:13,597 --> 00:12:15,389
- Hello.
- Hiya, Buddy-boy.

96
00:12:15,516 --> 00:12:19,348
I'm in this bar on 61st Street
and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.

97
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:22,016
That's very nice of you but... who is this?

98
00:12:22,148 --> 00:12:24,638
Dobisch. Joe Dobisch, in Administration.

99
00:12:24,775 --> 00:12:28,558
- Oh, yeah. I didn't recognize your voice.
- That's OK, Buddy-boy.

100
00:12:28,695 --> 00:12:33,238
Like I was saying, I'm in this joint
on 61st and I think I got lucky.

101
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,448
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch. I like to help
you fellas out, but it's sort of late.

102
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,909
- Why don't we make it some other time?
- Listen, kid. I can't pass this up.

103
00:12:43,043 --> 00:12:45,746
She looks like Marilyn Monroe.

104
00:12:45,877 --> 00:12:50,123
I'm already in bed. And I took a sleeping
pill. So I'm afraid the answer is no.

105
00:12:50,674 --> 00:12:54,803
We're doing the monthly efficiency rating.
I'm putting you in the top ten.

106
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:57,170
You don't wanna
louse yourself up, do you?

107
00:12:57,305 --> 00:13:02,049
No. But how can I be efficient in the
office if I don't get enough sleep at night?

108
00:13:02,183 --> 00:13:06,312
It's only eleven, and I just
want the place for 45 minutes.

109
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:11,482
I'm getting lonely.
Who are you talking to, anyway?

110
00:13:11,608 --> 00:13:15,608
- My mother.
- Oh, that's sweet. That's real sweet.

111
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,864
Ooh!

112
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:22,076
Make it 30 minutes.
What do you say, Bud, huh?

113
00:13:22,662 --> 00:13:25,996
I'm all out of liquor,
there's no clean glasses...

114
00:13:26,124 --> 00:13:29,788
- There's no cheese crackers. No nothin'.
- Let me worry about that.

115
00:13:29,918 --> 00:13:32,754
Just leave the key under the mat
and clear out.

116
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,918
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.

117
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:38,503
Anything you say, Mr. Dobisch

118
00:13:39,343 --> 00:13:43,094
No trouble at all, Mr. Dobisch
Be my guest!

119
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,927
We never close at Buddy-boy's.

120
00:13:50,688 --> 00:13:52,729
"Looks like Marilyn Monroe"!

121
00:14:36,188 --> 00:14:39,106
- This the place?
- Yeah.

122
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:41,191
- How much?
- 70 cents.

123
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:43,358
Get the money, will you?

124
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,111
Watch those stingers!

125
00:14:48,493 --> 00:14:50,530
- Give him a buck.
- Thanks, lady.

126
00:14:52,453 --> 00:14:54,492
Put it back, honey!

127
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,414
Attagirl.

128
00:14:58,542 --> 00:15:01,710
- Are you sure this is a good idea?
- Can't think of a better one.

129
00:15:01,838 --> 00:15:04,125
Barging in on your mother so late at night.

130
00:15:04,254 --> 00:15:08,883
Don't worry about the old lady. One
squawk from her and she's out of a job.

131
00:15:17,185 --> 00:15:19,223
(Door closes)

132
00:15:24,985 --> 00:15:27,023
Get the key, will you?

133
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,983
Not there! Under the mat.

134
00:15:30,113 --> 00:15:32,818
- Under the mat?
- Yeah. Come on.

135
00:15:33,576 --> 00:15:36,029
Open up. We haven't got all night.

136
00:15:39,456 --> 00:15:42,953
- This is your mother's apartment?
- That's right.

137
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,586
(Drunken giggling)

138
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:54,966
(Latin-beat dance music)

139
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:59,212
Mildred! He's at it again!

140
00:16:49,394 --> 00:16:51,803
- Morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
- How are you, Baxter?

141
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:55,853
- They keeping you busy these days?
- Yes, sir. They are indeed.

142
00:16:55,985 --> 00:16:59,650
Good morning, Mr. Kessel, Miss Robinson,
Mr. Williams, Miss Livingston.

143
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,615
Good morning, Mr. McKellway,
Mrs. Schubert, Mr. Davis.

144
00:17:02,741 --> 00:17:05,444
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
Good morning, Mr. Baxter.

145
00:17:05,577 --> 00:17:08,412
- Morning, Miss Kubelik.
- That's all. Take it away.

146
00:17:08,538 --> 00:17:10,994
Watch the door, please. Blasting off.

147
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:17,918
- What did you do to your hair?
- It made me nervous so I chopped it off.

148
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:21,332
- Big mistake, huh?
- No. I sort of like it. (Snuffles)

149
00:17:21,466 --> 00:17:24,171
- You got a lulu.
- Yeah. Better not get too close.

150
00:17:24,302 --> 00:17:26,213
- I never catch colds.
- Really?

151
00:17:26,347 --> 00:17:29,180
I was reading some sickness
and accident claims figures.

152
00:17:29,307 --> 00:17:33,933
The average New Yorker aged between
20 and 50 has two and a half colds a year.

153
00:17:34,061 --> 00:17:36,517
- That makes me feel just terrible.
- Why?

154
00:17:36,648 --> 00:17:40,895
If I have no colds a year, some poor slob
must have five colds a year.

155
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:44,610
- Yeah. It's me.
- You shoulda stayed in bed this morning.

156
00:17:44,738 --> 00:17:47,193
I shoulda stayed in bed last night.

157
00:17:47,991 --> 00:17:49,533
19!

158
00:17:52,787 --> 00:17:54,496
Watch your step.

159
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:57,196
- And watch your hands, Mr. Kirkeby!
- Pardon?

160
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,831
One of these days I'm gonna
shut these doors on you and...

161
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:04,833
20 next!

162
00:18:05,506 --> 00:18:09,292
That Kubelik. Boy, would I like
to get her on a slow elevator to China!

163
00:18:09,428 --> 00:18:13,009
- She's the best operator in the building.
- I'm pretty good myself.

164
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:16,223
- But she won't give me a date.
- Maybe it's your approach.

165
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:20,134
A lot of guys around here have tried
all kinds of approaches. No dice.

166
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:24,434
- What's she trying to prove?
- She could just be a nice respectable girl.

167
00:18:24,566 --> 00:18:27,058
Listen to him! Little Lord Fauntleroy.

168
00:18:32,033 --> 00:18:34,071
(Bell)

169
00:18:52,384 --> 00:18:56,382
Hello. Mr. Dobisch?
This is Baxter on the 19th floor.

170
00:18:56,513 --> 00:18:58,256
Oh, Buddy-boy!

171
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:03,347
I was just about to call you. I'm sorry
about that mess on the living room wall.

172
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:07,640
My friend kept insisting Picasso was
a bum, so she started to do that mural.

173
00:19:07,774 --> 00:19:10,231
It's not Picasso I'm calling about.

174
00:19:10,361 --> 00:19:15,021
It's the key to my apartment.
You're supposed to leave it under the mat.

175
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:18,323
But I did. I distinctly
remember putting it there.

176
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:21,533
Oh, I found the key all right.
Only it's the wrong key!

177
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:27,913
It is? No wonder I couldn't get into
the executive washroom this morning.

178
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,498
And I couldn't get into my apartment!

179
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:34,577
So at 4am I gotta wake up the landlady
and give her a whole song and dance.

180
00:19:34,714 --> 00:19:37,965
That's a shame.
I'll send the key right down.

181
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,050
And about your promotion.

182
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,381
I'll send that efficiency report
to Mr. Sheldrake in Personnel.

183
00:19:43,514 --> 00:19:45,971
You may hear from him
before the day's over.

184
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,139
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.

185
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,145
(Coughs)

186
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:17,120
From Mr. Dobisch.

187
00:20:17,254 --> 00:20:19,294
Wait.

188
00:20:29,974 --> 00:20:32,014
For Mr. Dobisch.

189
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:40,772
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

190
00:20:53,913 --> 00:20:55,373
(Phone rings)

191
00:20:55,499 --> 00:20:57,325
Vanderhof. Public Relations.

192
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,498
Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.

193
00:20:59,627 --> 00:21:02,913
All right, Miss Finch.
Type up what we got so far.

194
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,838
Look, I've got you down for tonight,...

195
00:21:07,968 --> 00:21:11,303
..but I'll be using the place myself,
so I'll have to cancel.

196
00:21:11,431 --> 00:21:14,300
But it's her birthday.
I already ordered the cake.

197
00:21:14,432 --> 00:21:19,592
But I am sick. I got a terrible cold and a
fever. I got to go to bed right after work.

198
00:21:19,729 --> 00:21:23,478
If you got a cold, you go to a Turkish bath.
Spend the night. Sweat it out.

199
00:21:23,608 --> 00:21:27,771
That's how you get pneumonia. If I got
pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month.

200
00:21:27,903 --> 00:21:32,315
OK. You made your point. We'll just
have to do it next Wednesday night.

201
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:38,036
- It's the only night I can get away.
- Wednesday, Wednesday... Wednesday.

202
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:41,952
I got somebody penciled in.

203
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,953
Let me see what I can do.
I'll get back to you.

204
00:21:55,305 --> 00:21:59,431
- Mr. Eichelberger.
- Oh, yes, Baxter. What's your problem?

205
00:22:01,268 --> 00:22:06,392
Wednesday is out? Oh, that throws
a little monkey wrench into my agenda.

206
00:22:06,523 --> 00:22:09,808
Thursday? No,
I'm all tied up on Thursday.

207
00:22:11,194 --> 00:22:14,443
Let's schedule that, uh...
meeting for Friday.

208
00:22:14,571 --> 00:22:16,612
Friday.

209
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:20,284
Let me see what I can do.
I'll get back to you.

210
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:30,868
Premium-wise and billing-wise, we are 18
per cent ahead of last year October-wise.

211
00:22:31,003 --> 00:22:33,044
(Phone rings)

212
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,673
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?

213
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,051
Instead of Friday, could you
possibly switch to Thursday?

214
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:42,965
You'd be doing me a great favor.

215
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:45,845
Let me check. I'll get back to you.

216
00:22:47,603 --> 00:22:50,140
Consolidated Life. I'll connect you.

217
00:22:50,271 --> 00:22:52,229
Sylvia, it's for you.

218
00:22:52,357 --> 00:22:54,149
Yeah?

219
00:22:54,276 --> 00:22:55,934
Oh, hello.

220
00:22:56,069 --> 00:22:59,401
Sure I got home all right.
You owe me 45 cents.

221
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:03,231
Look, Sylvia. Instead of Friday,
could we make it Thursday night?

222
00:23:03,534 --> 00:23:08,610
Thursday?! Well, that's
The Untouchables with Bob Stack!

223
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:10,996
Bob who?

224
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:15,158
All right, so we'll watch it
at the apartment. Big deal!

225
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,962
Hello, Baxter? It's OK for Thursday.

226
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,674
Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.

227
00:23:34,229 --> 00:23:36,802
Mr. Eichelberger, it's OK for Friday.

228
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:47,192
Mr. Vanderhof? OK for Wednesday.

229
00:23:58,126 --> 00:24:00,035
All right. I'll tell him.

230
00:24:00,168 --> 00:24:04,003
Hey, Baxter, that was Personnel.
Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.

231
00:24:04,132 --> 00:24:09,089
She's been trying to reach you for the last
20 minutes. They want you upstairs.

232
00:24:09,971 --> 00:24:14,846
- Are you getting promoted? Or fired?
- Would you care to make a small wager?

233
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:19,187
- I've been here twice as long as you but...
- Let's say a dollar?

234
00:24:19,313 --> 00:24:20,890
It's a bet!

235
00:24:34,118 --> 00:24:36,360
- Going up?
- Oh! Excuse me.

236
00:24:36,495 --> 00:24:42,579
27, please. Drive carefully. You're carrying
precious cargo. I mean manpower-wise.

237
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,199
27.

238
00:24:44,335 --> 00:24:48,286
You may not realize it, but I am
in the top ten, efficiency-wise,...

239
00:24:48,422 --> 00:24:51,209
..and this may be the day promotion-wise.

240
00:24:51,342 --> 00:24:54,011
You're beginning to sound
like Mr. Kirkeby already.

241
00:24:54,136 --> 00:24:58,181
- Why not, as they're kicking me upstairs?
- Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

242
00:24:58,307 --> 00:25:02,008
You know, you're the only one
who takes his hat off in the elevator.

243
00:25:02,144 --> 00:25:04,431
Something happens to men in elevators.

244
00:25:04,563 --> 00:25:07,563
It's the change of altitude.
The blood rushes to their head.

245
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,893
- I could tell you stories...
- I'd love to hear 'em.

246
00:25:11,027 --> 00:25:13,600
We could have lunch
in the cafeteria sometime.

247
00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:15,694
Or some evening, after work?

248
00:25:15,822 --> 00:25:17,982
- 27.
- Oh.

249
00:25:18,118 --> 00:25:20,785
- I hope everything goes all right.
- I hope so.

250
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,662
They would call me today,
what with my cold.

251
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,244
- How do I look?
- Fine. Wait.

252
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,702
Thank you.

253
00:25:28,835 --> 00:25:33,663
I noticed, when you were still on the
local elevator, you always wore a flower.

254
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:36,290
Good luck. And wipe your nose.

255
00:25:52,023 --> 00:25:55,475
CC Baxter, Ordinary Premium Accounting.
Mr. Sheldrake called me.

256
00:25:55,611 --> 00:25:58,396
I called you. That is,
I tried to for 20 minutes.

257
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,569
- I'm sorry.
- Go on in.

258
00:26:12,292 --> 00:26:13,870
- Baxter?
- Yes, sir.

259
00:26:14,003 --> 00:26:16,041
Come in, come in.

260
00:26:17,005 --> 00:26:19,957
I was sort of wondering
what you looked like, Baxter.

261
00:26:20,089 --> 00:26:22,582
- Sit down.
- Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

262
00:26:24,095 --> 00:26:26,847
Been hearing some nice things about you.

263
00:26:26,972 --> 00:26:30,057
Mr. Dobisch says you're loyal,
cooperative, resourceful.

264
00:26:30,184 --> 00:26:34,560
- Mr. Dobisch said that?
- Mr. Kirkeby tells me you often work late...

265
00:26:34,688 --> 00:26:37,974
- ..without overtime.
- You know how it is. Things pile up.

266
00:26:38,691 --> 00:26:42,309
Mr. Vanderhof in Public Relations and
Mr. Eichelberger in Mortgage and Loans...

267
00:26:42,445 --> 00:26:45,363
..would both like you
transferred to their departments.

268
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,398
Very flattering.

269
00:26:48,492 --> 00:26:52,738
Tell me, Baxter. Just what is it
that makes you so popular?

270
00:26:52,871 --> 00:26:56,288
- I don't know.
- Think.

271
00:27:01,546 --> 00:27:05,590
- Would you mind repeating the question?
- Look, Baxter. I'm not stupid.

272
00:27:05,717 --> 00:27:10,295
I know everything that goes on
in this building every day of the year.

273
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,888
You do?

274
00:27:12,013 --> 00:27:16,557
In 1957 we had an employee here,
name of Fowler. He was very popular too.

275
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:19,390
It turned out
he was running a bookie joint,...

276
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,056
..tying up our switchboard, using
our IBM machines to figure the odds.

277
00:27:23,192 --> 00:27:27,484
The day before the Kentucky Derby I
called in the vice squad, who raided him.

278
00:27:27,611 --> 00:27:29,650
- The vice squad?
- That's right.

279
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:33,066
What's that got to do with me?
I'm not running any bookie joint.

280
00:27:33,202 --> 00:27:36,699
- Just what kind of joint are you running?
- Sir?

281
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:41,906
A key is floating around from Kirkeby
to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch.

282
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:44,034
It's the key to a certain apartment.

283
00:27:44,168 --> 00:27:47,586
- Know who that apartment belongs to?
- Who?

284
00:27:48,047 --> 00:27:51,083
Loyal, resourceful, cooperative CC Baxter.

285
00:27:53,636 --> 00:27:56,092
- Oh.
- Are you going to deny it?

286
00:27:57,223 --> 00:28:01,055
No. I'm not going to deny it.
If you'd just let me explain.

287
00:28:01,727 --> 00:28:03,554
You'd better.

288
00:28:03,688 --> 00:28:05,727
Well,...

289
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:11,191
..about a year ago, I was going to night
school, studying advanced accounting.

290
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:16,313
One of the guys in our department lives
in Jersey had to go to a banquet in town.

291
00:28:16,449 --> 00:28:20,861
He needed someplace to change
into a tuxedo, so I gave him the key.

292
00:28:20,994 --> 00:28:26,950
Word must've gotten out because all sorts
of guys were suddenly going to banquets.

293
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:31,959
You give the key to one guy, you can't
say no to another. It all got out of hand.

294
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:38,382
Baxter, an insurance company
is founded on public trust.

295
00:28:38,511 --> 00:28:41,797
Any employee who conducts himself
in a manner unbecoming...

296
00:28:41,931 --> 00:28:44,966
How many charter members
are there in this little club?

297
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,884
Just those four. Out of a total of 31,259.

298
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:53,101
So actually we can be very proud
of our personnel... percentage-wise.

299
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:57,894
That's not the point. Four rotten apples
in a barrel, however large the barrel...

300
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:01,232
- Do you realize if this ever leaked out...
- It won't!

301
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:06,359
Believe me. Never again. Nobody
is gonna use my apartment from now on.

302
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:09,165
- Where is your apartment?
- West 67th Street.

303
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:14,793
You have no idea what I go through with
the neighbors, the landlady and the key.

304
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,958
How do you work it with the key?

305
00:29:17,087 --> 00:29:21,963
I slip it to 'em in the office and they leave
it under a mat. Never again. I promise.

306
00:29:22,092 --> 00:29:24,133
(Intercom buzzer)

307
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,594
- Yes, Miss Olsen?
- Mrs. Sheldrake, returning your call. On 2.

308
00:29:34,104 --> 00:29:36,226
(Sheldrake) Yes, dear. Where were you?

309
00:29:37,024 --> 00:29:41,815
You had to take Tommy to the dentist?
No cavities? Good. Hold it, dear.

310
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,980
- Where are you going, Baxter?
- I don't wanna intrude.

311
00:29:45,114 --> 00:29:48,449
- Since this is straightened out...
- I'm not through with you yet.

312
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,782
I won't be home for dinner tonight.

313
00:29:50,911 --> 00:29:54,908
The branch manager from Kansas City
is in town. I'm taking him to the theatre.

314
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:56,868
Music Man. What else?

315
00:29:57,001 --> 00:29:59,537
No, don't wait up for me,
darling. Goodbye.

316
00:30:00,754 --> 00:30:04,170
Tell me, Baxter.
Have you seen Music Man?

317
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:06,920
Not yet. I hear it's one swell show.

318
00:30:07,052 --> 00:30:09,293
How would you like to go tonight?

319
00:30:09,429 --> 00:30:13,722
You and me? I thought you were taking
the branch manager from Kansas City.

320
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:17,134
No, I have other plans.
You can have both tickets.

321
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:19,309
Well... that's very kind of you.

322
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:23,482
But I'm not feeling well. I've got
this cold. I'm gonna go right home.

323
00:30:23,608 --> 00:30:27,190
Baxter, you're not reading me.
I told you I have plans.

324
00:30:27,611 --> 00:30:30,816
So do I. I'm gonna take
four aspirins, get into bed.

325
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:33,190
So give the tickets to somebody else.

326
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:38,279
Look, Baxter. I'm not just giving
these tickets. I wanna swap them.

327
00:30:38,413 --> 00:30:40,572
Swap 'em? For what?

328
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:47,704
It also says here that you are
alert, astute and quite imaginative.

329
00:30:48,966 --> 00:30:50,874
Oh?

330
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,969
Oh...

331
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:11,527
That's good thinking, Baxter. There's
gonna be a shift in personnel next month.

332
00:31:11,653 --> 00:31:15,520
And as far as I'm concerned,
you are executive material.

333
00:31:15,657 --> 00:31:18,112
- I am?
- Now put down the key.

334
00:31:21,286 --> 00:31:23,326
And put down the address.

335
00:31:25,332 --> 00:31:30,494
It's on the second floor. There's no name
over the door. It just says apartment 2A.

336
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,456
- It's that cold.
- Relax, Baxter.

337
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:35,630
Yes, thank you, sir.

338
00:31:37,677 --> 00:31:40,762
You will be careful with
the record player? Shh.

339
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,926
Oh, and about the liquor.

340
00:31:43,057 --> 00:31:47,636
I ordered some this morning.
I don't know when they'll deliver it.

341
00:31:48,688 --> 00:31:51,723
- This is going to be our little secret.
- Of course.

342
00:31:51,858 --> 00:31:54,526
- You know how people talk.
- Don't worry about that.

343
00:31:54,651 --> 00:31:58,399
- Not that I have anything to hide.
- No! Anyway, it's none of my business.

344
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:02,398
Four apples, five apples.
What's the difference?

345
00:32:02,535 --> 00:32:04,573
Percentage-wise.

346
00:32:04,702 --> 00:32:07,276
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.

347
00:32:07,413 --> 00:32:09,452
You too, sir.

348
00:32:41,487 --> 00:32:45,437
So I figure, a man in his position,
he'll take me to EI Morocco, maybe 21.

349
00:32:45,575 --> 00:32:50,116
Instead he takes me to Hamburger
Heaven and some schnook's apartment.

350
00:32:55,084 --> 00:32:57,121
- Good night.
- Good night.

351
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:01,501
Oh! Miss Kubelik?

352
00:33:01,631 --> 00:33:04,797
I've been waiting for you.
I almost didn't recognize you.

353
00:33:04,925 --> 00:33:08,091
This is the first time
I've seen you in civilian clothes.

354
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:10,508
- How'd it go on the 27th floor?
- Great.

355
00:33:10,638 --> 00:33:13,044
- Look, have you seen The Music Man?
- No.

356
00:33:13,182 --> 00:33:14,806
- Would you like to?
- Sure.

357
00:33:14,933 --> 00:33:17,259
We could get a bite to eat first,
and then go.

358
00:33:17,394 --> 00:33:18,973
- Oh, you mean tonight?
- Yeah.

359
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:22,189
- I'm sorry, I can't. I'm meeting somebody.
- Oh.

360
00:33:22,316 --> 00:33:25,898
- You mean... Like a girlfriend?
- No. Like a man.

361
00:33:26,028 --> 00:33:30,606
I wasn't trying to be personal. The fellas
in the office were wondering if you ever...

362
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,699
You tell 'em now and then.

363
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:37,155
This date, is it... just a date?
Or is it something serious?

364
00:33:37,288 --> 00:33:40,739
Well, it used to be serious.
At least, I was. But he wasn't.

365
00:33:40,874 --> 00:33:43,247
So now the whole thing is
more or less kaput.

366
00:33:43,377 --> 00:33:45,998
- In that case, couldn't you...
- I'm afraid not.

367
00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:50,256
I promised I'd have a drink with him.
He's been calling me all week.

368
00:33:50,926 --> 00:33:53,168
I understand.

369
00:33:53,303 --> 00:33:57,845
Well, it was just an idea. I hate
to see a theatre ticket go to waste.

370
00:33:57,973 --> 00:34:01,057
- What time does the show go on?
- 8.30.

371
00:34:01,184 --> 00:34:03,558
Well, I could meet you at the theatre.

372
00:34:03,689 --> 00:34:07,766
That's wonderful!
It's the Majestic on 44th Street.

373
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,773
I'll meet you in the lobby.

374
00:34:09,902 --> 00:34:13,401
You know, I felt so lousy
this morning. Had 101 fever.

375
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:17,028
Now along comes my promotion
and us - 11th row centre.

376
00:34:17,158 --> 00:34:19,116
And you said I should've stayed in bed.

377
00:34:19,244 --> 00:34:21,401
- How is your cold?
- What cold?

378
00:34:21,537 --> 00:34:25,582
After the show we could go out
on the town. (Hums dance tune)

379
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:28,495
- I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
- So I see.

380
00:34:28,627 --> 00:34:31,629
There's a great band
at EI Chico, in the Village.

381
00:34:31,756 --> 00:34:35,289
- Around the corner from where you live.
- Sounds good.

382
00:34:35,424 --> 00:34:40,052
- How do you know where I live?
- Oh, I... even know who you live with.

383
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,220
Your sister and brother-in-law.

384
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:46,297
I know when you were born and where.
I know all sorts of things about you.

385
00:34:46,436 --> 00:34:47,847
How come?

386
00:34:47,979 --> 00:34:52,686
A couple of months ago I looked up
your card in the group insurance file.

387
00:34:52,815 --> 00:34:56,731
I know your height and your weight
and your social security number.

388
00:34:56,862 --> 00:35:00,776
You had mumps and measles
and you had your appendix out.

389
00:35:01,741 --> 00:35:04,908
Don't mention the appendix
to the fellas in the office.

390
00:35:05,037 --> 00:35:09,781
I wouldn't want 'em to get the wrong idea
about how you found out. Bye.

391
00:35:13,126 --> 00:35:15,166
8.30!

392
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:42,861
(Light music)

393
00:35:50,494 --> 00:35:53,578
(Plays "Jealous Lover")

394
00:36:04,092 --> 00:36:08,171
- Good evening, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Please, Fran. Not so loud.

395
00:36:08,303 --> 00:36:10,758
Still afraid someone
might see us together?

396
00:36:10,889 --> 00:36:14,508
- Let me take your coat.
- No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.

397
00:36:15,852 --> 00:36:19,056
- Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
- It's on the way.

398
00:36:20,148 --> 00:36:23,598
- I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
- That's right.

399
00:36:23,734 --> 00:36:27,067
- You know I liked it better long.
- I know.

400
00:36:27,195 --> 00:36:30,066
You want a lock to carry in your wallet?

401
00:36:30,824 --> 00:36:34,359
- Evening, lady. Nice to see you again.
- Thank you.

402
00:36:35,494 --> 00:36:37,783
How long has it been, Fran? A month?

403
00:36:37,913 --> 00:36:40,583
Six weeks. But who's counting?

404
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:43,707
I missed you.

405
00:36:46,255 --> 00:36:48,294
Like old times.

406
00:36:48,423 --> 00:36:51,128
Same booth. Same song.

407
00:36:52,011 --> 00:36:56,138
- It's been hell.
- Same sauce. Sweet-and-sour.

408
00:36:58,682 --> 00:37:01,887
You don't know what it's like,
next to you in that elevator.

409
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:05,222
"Good morning, Miss Kubelik."
"Good night, Mr. Sheldrake."

410
00:37:05,355 --> 00:37:07,893
I'm still crazy about you, Fran.

411
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:13,530
Let's not start on that again, Jeff. Please?
I'm just beginning to get over it.

412
00:37:14,864 --> 00:37:17,320
I don't believe you.

413
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:21,534
Look, Jeff. We had two
wonderful months this summer.

414
00:37:21,661 --> 00:37:24,534
But that was it. Happens all the time.

415
00:37:24,665 --> 00:37:28,793
Wife and kids go away to the country and
the boss has a fling with his secretary,...

416
00:37:28,919 --> 00:37:31,671
..or the manicurist, or the elevator girl.

417
00:37:31,797 --> 00:37:35,213
Come September,
the picnic's over. Goodbye.

418
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:39,387
The kids go back to school,
the boss goes back to the wife,...

419
00:37:39,513 --> 00:37:41,552
..and the girl...

420
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:45,892
They don't make these shrimp
like they used to.

421
00:37:49,064 --> 00:37:51,731
I never said goodbye, Fran.

422
00:37:53,276 --> 00:37:58,649
For a while there, you try kidding yourself
that you're going with an unmarried man.

423
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,568
Then one day he keeps
looking at his watch...

424
00:38:01,701 --> 00:38:04,321
..and asks you if any lipstick's showing,...

425
00:38:04,452 --> 00:38:07,950
..then rushes out to catch
the 7.14 to White Plains.

426
00:38:09,165 --> 00:38:12,747
So you fix yourself
a cup of instant coffee...

427
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:16,626
..and you sit there
by yourself and you think,...

428
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:20,916
..and it all begins to look so... ugly.

429
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:28,260
How do you think I felt
riding home on that 7.14 train?

430
00:38:28,391 --> 00:38:32,603
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff?
What do you want from me?

431
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:34,768
I want you back, Fran.

432
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:38,811
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake. I'm full up.
You'll have to take the next elevator.

433
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:42,856
You're not giving me a chance, Fran.
I have something to tell you.

434
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,855
- Go ahead. Tell me.
- Not here. Can't we go someplace else?

435
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,827
- No. I have a date at 8.30.
- Oh?

436
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:54,035
- Important?
- Not very, but I'm gonna be there anyway.

437
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:56,834
- You ready order dinner now?
- No. No dinner.

438
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,450
Just bring us two more drinks, will you?

439
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,055
(Coughs)

440
00:39:19,397 --> 00:39:22,268
Fran, do you remember
that last weekend we had?

441
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:27,276
Do I! That leaky boat you rented, and me
in a black negligee and a life preserver.

442
00:39:27,404 --> 00:39:29,776
Do you remember what we talked about?

443
00:39:29,906 --> 00:39:33,524
- We talked about a lot of things.
- I mean about my getting a divorce.

444
00:39:33,659 --> 00:39:36,033
We didn't talk about it, Jeff. You did.

445
00:39:36,163 --> 00:39:38,203
You didn't believe me, did you?

446
00:39:38,332 --> 00:39:42,791
They got it on a long-playing record now.
"Music to String Her Along By."

447
00:39:42,918 --> 00:39:47,746
"My wife doesn't understand me. You're
the best thing that ever happened to me."

448
00:39:47,883 --> 00:39:51,214
- That's enough, Fran.
- "Trust me, baby. We'll work it out."

449
00:39:51,342 --> 00:39:54,047
- You're not being funny.
- I wasn't trying.

450
00:39:54,597 --> 00:39:58,594
- Fran, just listen to me for a minute.
- All right. I'm sorry.

451
00:39:58,726 --> 00:40:03,802
I saw my lawyer this morning. I wanted
his advice about the best way to handle it.

452
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,393
- Handle what?
- What do you think?

453
00:40:07,858 --> 00:40:12,354
Let's get something straight, Jeff.
I never asked you to leave your wife.

454
00:40:12,488 --> 00:40:15,239
Of course not. You had
nothing to do with it.

455
00:40:17,242 --> 00:40:19,365
Are you sure that's what you want?

456
00:40:20,411 --> 00:40:24,029
I'm sure... if you'll just tell me
that you still love me.

457
00:40:27,251 --> 00:40:29,290
You know I do.

458
00:40:32,464 --> 00:40:34,089
Fran.

459
00:40:35,759 --> 00:40:37,633
(Woman laughs)

460
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,800
Jeff, darling...

461
00:40:46,228 --> 00:40:49,312
It is getting crowded. Let's get out of here.

462
00:40:57,571 --> 00:41:00,654
(Pianist plays "Jealous Lover")

463
00:41:21,718 --> 00:41:23,261
Taxi!

464
00:41:23,388 --> 00:41:26,969
- Jeff, I have that date, remember?
- But I love you, remember?

465
00:41:27,098 --> 00:41:29,720
- (Whistles)
- Where are we going?

466
00:41:29,851 --> 00:41:32,638
- Not back to that leaky boat?
- I promise.

467
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:39,647
51 West 67th.

468
00:42:22,692 --> 00:42:24,731
Congratulations.

469
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:43,125
Would you mind? CC Baxter - that's me.

470
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:48,669
Thank you.

471
00:43:02,687 --> 00:43:03,802
(Door opens)

472
00:43:03,938 --> 00:43:07,438
(Kirkeby) Hi, Buddy-boy.
Congratulations and all that jazz.

473
00:43:07,567 --> 00:43:11,066
- Hi, fellas.
- Well, you made it, just like we promised.

474
00:43:11,194 --> 00:43:14,397
Quite an office.
Name on the door, rug on the floor.

475
00:43:14,531 --> 00:43:19,241
Teamwork: that's what counts in this
organization. All for one and one for all.

476
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:21,408
- Know what I mean?
- I have a vague idea.

477
00:43:21,538 --> 00:43:24,705
Baxter, we're a little disappointed
in you, gratitude-wise.

478
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:28,283
- Oh, I'm very grateful.
- Then why are you locking us out?

479
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:34,043
Well, it's been sort of rough the past few
weeks, what with my cold and... Like that.

480
00:43:34,176 --> 00:43:37,010
We went to bat for you.
Now you won't play ball with us.

481
00:43:37,136 --> 00:43:41,465
After all, it's my apartment. It's
private property, not a public playground.

482
00:43:41,598 --> 00:43:45,844
So you got yourself a girl. That's OK
with us. But not every night in the week!

483
00:43:45,977 --> 00:43:47,721
How selfish can you get?

484
00:43:47,855 --> 00:43:51,637
Last week I had to use my nephew's car
and take Sylvia to a drive-in in Jersey.

485
00:43:51,774 --> 00:43:54,811
I'm too old for that sort of thing -
I mean in a Volkswagen.

486
00:43:54,944 --> 00:43:58,193
I sympathize with you.
Believe me, I'm very sorry.

487
00:43:58,321 --> 00:44:01,656
- You'll be a lot sorrier.
- Are you threatening me?

488
00:44:01,784 --> 00:44:04,869
Listen, Baxter. We made you
and we can break you.

489
00:44:06,121 --> 00:44:09,038
- Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Good morning, gentlemen.

490
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:13,292
- Baxter, do you like your office?
- Yes, sir. I wanna thank you very much.

491
00:44:13,419 --> 00:44:16,337
Don't thank me.
Your friends here recommended you.

492
00:44:16,463 --> 00:44:20,248
- We just dropped by to wish him luck.
- We know you won't let us down.

493
00:44:20,384 --> 00:44:25,129
So long, fellas. Drop in any time.
The door is always open... to my office.

494
00:44:26,014 --> 00:44:28,090
I like the way you handled that, Baxter.

495
00:44:28,225 --> 00:44:30,797
- How does it feel to be an executive?
- Oh, fine.

496
00:44:30,935 --> 00:44:34,767
- I'll work hard to justify your confidence.
- I'm sure you will.

497
00:44:34,899 --> 00:44:39,690
About the apartment. Now that you've got
a raise, can't we afford a second key?

498
00:44:39,818 --> 00:44:42,226
- I guess so.
- You know my secretary, Miss Olsen?

499
00:44:42,364 --> 00:44:45,149
- Oh, yeah. Is she the lucky girl that...?
- Oh, no, no.

500
00:44:45,281 --> 00:44:50,572
I just meant that she's kind of a busybody,
and passing that key back and forth...

501
00:44:50,703 --> 00:44:53,326
- Why take chances?
- You can't be too careful.

502
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:56,493
Oh, I... have something
I think belongs to you.

503
00:44:56,626 --> 00:44:59,163
- Me?
- I mean the young lady, whoever she is.

504
00:44:59,295 --> 00:45:02,047
- I found it when I got back last night.
- Oh. Thanks.

505
00:45:02,174 --> 00:45:05,672
The mirror is broken.
It was broken when I found it.

506
00:45:07,386 --> 00:45:10,222
- Yeah. She threw it at me.
- Sir?

507
00:45:10,348 --> 00:45:12,837
You know how it is.
They always give you a bad time.

508
00:45:12,974 --> 00:45:14,053
Yeah, I know how it is.

509
00:45:14,184 --> 00:45:18,929
You see a girl every week for laughs and
they think you're gonna divorce your wife.

510
00:45:19,064 --> 00:45:22,265
- Now I ask you, is that fair?
- No, sir. It's very unfair.

511
00:45:22,399 --> 00:45:24,392
- Especially to your wife.
- Yeah.

512
00:45:24,819 --> 00:45:29,396
You know, Baxter, I envy you. A bachelor,
all the dames you want, no complications.

513
00:45:29,532 --> 00:45:31,109
That's the life all right.

514
00:45:31,241 --> 00:45:33,530
- Put me down for Thursday again.
- Roger.

515
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,901
And I'll get that other key.

516
00:45:48,133 --> 00:45:52,000
- Merry Christmas. I'll connect you.
- Merry Christmas. Consolidated Life.

517
00:45:52,136 --> 00:45:54,128
Merry Christmas. I'm ringing.

518
00:45:54,263 --> 00:45:56,303
Yeah? Yeah?!

519
00:45:56,432 --> 00:45:57,546
Where?

520
00:45:57,682 --> 00:45:58,929
You bet!

521
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:03,389
Somebody watch my line. There's
a swingin' party on the 19th floor!

522
00:46:05,731 --> 00:46:08,733
# Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh

523
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:12,608
# Hey! Jingle bells,
jingle bells, jingle all the way

524
00:46:12,738 --> 00:46:16,023
# Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh

525
00:46:16,158 --> 00:46:18,197
(Singing continues)

526
00:46:32,173 --> 00:46:37,593
So I said to him "Never again. Either you
get yourself a bigger car or a smaller girl."

527
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:40,511
Miss Kubelik? Miss...

528
00:46:40,766 --> 00:46:42,970
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

529
00:46:43,099 --> 00:46:46,184
- I thought you were avoiding me.
- What gave you that idea?

530
00:46:46,311 --> 00:46:50,095
In six weeks you've only been in my
elevator once, and you kept on your hat.

531
00:46:50,231 --> 00:46:53,683
As a matter of fact, I was rather hurt
that night you stood me up.

532
00:46:53,818 --> 00:46:55,858
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.

533
00:46:55,987 --> 00:46:57,611
- I forgive you.
- You shouldn't.

534
00:46:57,738 --> 00:47:01,238
You couldn't help it. You can't
suddenly walk out on one man...

535
00:47:01,367 --> 00:47:03,609
..because you have a date
with another man.

536
00:47:03,745 --> 00:47:06,116
- You did the decent thing.
- Don't be too sure.

537
00:47:06,246 --> 00:47:09,745
Just because I wear a uniform,
that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.

538
00:47:09,874 --> 00:47:14,619
A second administrative assistant has
to be a pretty good judge of character.

539
00:47:14,753 --> 00:47:17,246
And as far as I'm concerned, you're tops.

540
00:47:17,382 --> 00:47:22,090
I mean decency-wise and... otherwise-wise.

541
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,259
Cheers.

542
00:47:26,015 --> 00:47:28,339
- One more.
- I shouldn't drink while driving.

543
00:47:28,475 --> 00:47:33,600
You're so right. By the power vested
in me, I declare this elevator out of order.

544
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:36,102
Shall we join the natives?

545
00:47:36,232 --> 00:47:39,768
- Why not? They seem friendly enough.
- Don't you believe it?

546
00:47:39,903 --> 00:47:44,030
There'll be human sacrifices. White-collar
workers tossed into computers...

547
00:47:44,156 --> 00:47:46,398
..and punched full of little square holes.

548
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:48,740
- How many drinks did you have?
- Three!

549
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:52,072
- I thought so.
- Wait. I hear the sound of running water.

550
00:47:52,205 --> 00:47:54,780
- I'll be right back!
- I'll be right here.

551
00:47:56,251 --> 00:47:57,909
(Slurring) Hi!

552
00:47:58,044 --> 00:48:00,665
How's the branch manager
from Kansas City?

553
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:02,505
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm Miss Olsen.

554
00:48:02,632 --> 00:48:04,590
Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.

555
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:07,090
So you don't have to
play innocent with me.

556
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:11,264
He used to tell his wife
I was the branch manager from Seattle...

557
00:48:11,391 --> 00:48:15,637
..four years ago when we were having
a little ring-a-ding-ding.

558
00:48:16,603 --> 00:48:20,730
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Before me it was Miss Rossi in Auditing.

559
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,527
And after me it was
Miss Koch in Disability.

560
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:26,024
And right before you was a Miss, um...

561
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:28,526
Oh, what's her name? On the 25th floor.

562
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:32,238
- Would you excuse me?
- What for? You haven't done anything.

563
00:48:32,452 --> 00:48:35,570
It's him. Oh, what a salesman!

564
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,535
Always the last booth
in the Chinese restaurant...

565
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:41,750
..and the same pitch
about divorcing his wife.

566
00:48:43,878 --> 00:48:48,338
Then, in the end, you wind up
with egg foo yung on your face.

567
00:48:48,466 --> 00:48:50,505
Miss Kubelik!

568
00:48:52,594 --> 00:48:54,387
Well, thank you, Miss Olsen.

569
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:58,641
Always happy to do a little something
for our girls in uniform.

570
00:48:59,852 --> 00:49:02,009
Are you all right? What's the matter?

571
00:49:02,145 --> 00:49:04,719
Nothing. There are just
too many people here.

572
00:49:04,857 --> 00:49:08,806
Why don't we step into my office? There's
something I want your opinion about.

573
00:49:08,943 --> 00:49:13,735
I have my own office now. I'm the second
youngest executive in this company.

574
00:49:13,864 --> 00:49:17,565
The only one younger is a grandson
of the chairman of the board.

575
00:49:18,827 --> 00:49:20,866
(Whistles) Do you mind?

576
00:49:25,083 --> 00:49:28,583
Miss Kubelik, I would like
your honest opinion.

577
00:49:28,711 --> 00:49:31,997
I've had this under my desk
for a week. It cost me $15.

578
00:49:32,132 --> 00:49:35,416
I haven't been able
to get up enough nerve to wear it.

579
00:49:41,098 --> 00:49:46,056
It's what they call the Junior Executive
model. What do you think?

580
00:49:49,481 --> 00:49:52,434
I guess I made a boo-boo, huh?

581
00:49:52,566 --> 00:49:54,809
- I like it.
- Really?

582
00:49:54,945 --> 00:49:57,861
You wouldn't be ashamed to be seen
with somebody in this hat?

583
00:49:57,988 --> 00:50:01,986
- Of course not.
- Maybe if I wore it a little to one side.

584
00:50:02,117 --> 00:50:04,870
- Is that better?
- Much better.

585
00:50:04,997 --> 00:50:07,699
Since you wouldn't be
ashamed to be seen with me,...

586
00:50:07,831 --> 00:50:10,950
..how about goin' out tonight -
you, me and the bowler?

587
00:50:11,085 --> 00:50:13,919
We'll stroll down 5th Avenue,
sort of break it in.

588
00:50:14,045 --> 00:50:17,877
- This is a bad day for me.
- I understand. Christmas and family.

589
00:50:18,008 --> 00:50:20,414
I'd better get back to my elevator
or I'll be fired.

590
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:24,384
Don't worry about that. I've got
quite a bit of influence with Personnel.

591
00:50:24,514 --> 00:50:26,554
You know Mr. Sheldrake?

592
00:50:28,057 --> 00:50:30,430
- Why?
- He and I are like that.

593
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,230
Sent me a Christmas card. See?

594
00:50:38,943 --> 00:50:41,696
Makes a cute picture.

595
00:50:42,656 --> 00:50:45,360
I could talk to Mr. Sheldrake.
Get you a promotion.

596
00:50:45,491 --> 00:50:51,196
- Would you like to be an elevator starter?
- Too many girls have seniority over me.

597
00:50:51,621 --> 00:50:54,705
No problem. Why don't we
discuss it over the holidays?

598
00:50:54,832 --> 00:50:59,246
I could call you, pick you up, have
a big unveiling. Am I wearing this right?

599
00:50:59,379 --> 00:51:01,537
I think so. Here.

600
00:51:01,673 --> 00:51:04,710
It's not tilted too much?
This is a conservative firm.

601
00:51:04,843 --> 00:51:07,926
I don't want people
to think I'm an entertainer.

602
00:51:12,391 --> 00:51:14,431
What's the matter?

603
00:51:17,187 --> 00:51:19,679
- The mirror. It's broken.
- Yes, I know.

604
00:51:20,773 --> 00:51:23,810
I like it that way.
Makes me look the way I feel.

605
00:51:23,944 --> 00:51:25,604
(Phone rings)

606
00:51:28,113 --> 00:51:30,153
Your phone.

607
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:37,869
Yes?

608
00:51:38,457 --> 00:51:40,283
Uh, just a minute.

609
00:51:40,418 --> 00:51:44,959
- If you don't mind, this is sort of personal.
- Have a nice Christmas.

610
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:53,757
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

611
00:51:54,846 --> 00:52:00,185
No, I didn't forget. The tree is up and the
Tom and Jerry mix is in the refrigerator.

612
00:52:00,309 --> 00:52:02,350
Yes, sir. Same to you.

613
00:52:10,278 --> 00:52:12,317
(Cheering)

614
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:32,120
Hey! Where are you goin', Buddy-boy?

615
00:52:32,256 --> 00:52:34,499
The party's just starting.

616
00:52:34,634 --> 00:52:38,049
Listen, kid. Gimme a break.
How about tomorrow afternoon?

617
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:43,683
I can't take her to that drive-in again.
The car has no heater. Four o'clock. OK?

618
00:52:56,196 --> 00:52:58,234
(Slow band music)

619
00:53:19,926 --> 00:53:25,513
Hey, Charlie! Gimme a shot of bourbon,
and step on it! My sleigh is double-parked!

620
00:54:19,106 --> 00:54:21,146
(Music ends)

621
00:54:32,827 --> 00:54:36,030
You buy me a drink,
I'll buy you some music.

622
00:54:36,164 --> 00:54:38,203
Rum Collins.

623
00:54:48,342 --> 00:54:49,670
Uh...

624
00:54:49,801 --> 00:54:53,419
Rum Collins and...
another one of these little mothers.

625
00:54:57,016 --> 00:54:59,686
("O Come, All Ye Faithful")

626
00:55:05,565 --> 00:55:07,522
You like Castro?

627
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:10,487
I mean, how do you feel about Castro?

628
00:55:10,613 --> 00:55:14,442
- What is Castro?
- You know. That big shot down in Cuba.

629
00:55:14,573 --> 00:55:16,733
- With the crazy beard.
- What about him?

630
00:55:16,869 --> 00:55:20,154
Cos as far as I'm concerned,
he's a no-good fink.

631
00:55:20,287 --> 00:55:23,656
Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter.
Never even answered me.

632
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:24,786
That so?

633
00:55:24,916 --> 00:55:28,748
All I wanted him to do was
let Mickey out for Christmas.

634
00:55:28,878 --> 00:55:30,919
- Who's Mickey?
- My husband.

635
00:55:31,048 --> 00:55:33,620
He's in Havana, in jail.

636
00:55:33,757 --> 00:55:37,293
- Mixed up in that revolution?
- Mickey would do nothin' like that.

637
00:55:37,428 --> 00:55:41,212
He's a jockey.
They caught him dopin' a horse.

638
00:55:41,349 --> 00:55:43,591
Well, you can't win 'em all.

639
00:55:48,772 --> 00:55:52,437
'Twas the night before Christmas,
and all through the house

640
00:55:52,567 --> 00:55:54,608
Not a creature was stirrin'...

641
00:55:55,404 --> 00:55:58,487
Nothin'. No action.

642
00:55:59,032 --> 00:56:00,940
Dullsville.

643
00:56:01,075 --> 00:56:03,199
- You married?
- No.

644
00:56:03,328 --> 00:56:05,367
- Family?
- No.

645
00:56:06,205 --> 00:56:10,748
A night like this, it sort of spooks you
to walk into an empty apartment.

646
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:16,463
I said I had no family. I didn't say
I had an empty apartment.

647
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:21,218
(Fran crying)

648
00:56:21,345 --> 00:56:23,800
Come on, Fran. Don't be that way.

649
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:27,516
Are you just gonna
sit there and keep bawling?

650
00:56:27,643 --> 00:56:30,928
You won't talk to me?
You won't tell me what's wrong?

651
00:56:32,687 --> 00:56:37,764
I know you think I'm stalling you but...
when you've been married for 12 years,...

652
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:42,480
..you just don't sit down to breakfast and
say "Pass the sugar. I want a divorce."

653
00:56:42,615 --> 00:56:45,187
It's not that easy.

654
00:56:46,451 --> 00:56:51,279
Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids
are off school, my in-laws are visiting.

655
00:56:51,414 --> 00:56:53,454
I can't bring it up now.

656
00:56:53,583 --> 00:56:55,124
(Fran sobs)

657
00:56:55,250 --> 00:57:00,327
This isn't like you, Fran. You were always
such a good sport. Such fun to be with.

658
00:57:02,674 --> 00:57:07,050
That's me. The happy idiot.
A million laughs.

659
00:57:08,012 --> 00:57:12,259
Well, that's a little more like it.
At least you're speaking to me.

660
00:57:13,225 --> 00:57:16,676
A funny thing happened to me
at the office party today.

661
00:57:16,813 --> 00:57:19,269
I ran into your secretary, Miss Olsen.

662
00:57:20,275 --> 00:57:22,313
You know. Ring-a-ding-ding?

663
00:57:23,403 --> 00:57:26,271
And I laughed so much, I like to died.

664
00:57:26,403 --> 00:57:31,031
Is that what's been bothering you, Fran?
Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.

665
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:34,243
Well, I never was very good at history.

666
00:57:34,954 --> 00:57:39,200
Let me see. There was Miss Olsen,
and then there was Miss Rossi.

667
00:57:39,334 --> 00:57:42,452
No, she came before.
Miss Koch came after Miss Olsen.

668
00:57:42,587 --> 00:57:44,994
- Now, Fran...
- And just think.

669
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:48,998
Right now some lucky girl in the building
is gonna come after me.

670
00:57:49,134 --> 00:57:51,885
OK. OK, Fran. I guess I deserved that.

671
00:57:52,011 --> 00:57:56,140
But ask yourself: why does a man
run around with a lot of girls?

672
00:57:56,266 --> 00:58:00,049
Because he's unhappy at home.
Because he's lonely. That's why.

673
00:58:00,186 --> 00:58:03,436
But that was before you, Fran.
I've stopped running.

674
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:09,109
How could I be so stupid?
You'd think I would've learned by now.

675
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:13,779
When you're in love with a married man,
you shouldn't wear mascara.

676
00:58:14,531 --> 00:58:17,652
It's Christmas Eve, Fran.
Let's not fight, huh?

677
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:22,410
- Merry Christmas.
- What is it?

678
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,587
Oh. Our friend at the Chinese restaurant.

679
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:37,129
- Thanks, Fran. We'd better keep it here.
- Yeah, we'd better.

680
00:58:37,887 --> 00:58:40,010
Oh, I have a present for you.

681
00:58:40,139 --> 00:58:44,515
I didn't know what to get you. Besides,
it's kind of awkward for me shopping, so...

682
00:58:44,642 --> 00:58:48,144
Here's $100. You go
and buy yourself something.

683
00:58:53,108 --> 00:58:56,313
They have some nice
alligator bags at Bergdorf's.

684
00:59:08,081 --> 00:59:12,210
I didn't realize it was so late. Its quarter
to seven. I mustn't miss my train.

685
00:59:12,336 --> 00:59:16,879
If we hadn't wasted all this time...
I have to get home and trim the tree.

686
00:59:17,466 --> 00:59:21,333
OK. I just thought,
as long as it was paid for...

687
00:59:21,469 --> 00:59:23,593
Don't ever talk like that, Fran.

688
00:59:23,722 --> 00:59:27,850
- Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
- $100? I don't call that cheap.

689
00:59:27,976 --> 00:59:32,104
And you must be paying somebody
something for the use of the apartment.

690
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:34,270
Stop it, Fran.

691
00:59:35,357 --> 00:59:37,397
You'll miss your train, Jeff.

692
00:59:46,034 --> 00:59:47,658
Are you coming?

693
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:50,455
No, you run along. I'm gonna fix my face.

694
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:53,117
Don't forget to kill the lights.
See you Monday.

695
00:59:53,248 --> 00:59:56,832
Sure. Monday... and Thursday...

696
00:59:56,961 --> 01:00:00,211
..and Monday again, and Thursday again.

697
01:00:02,174 --> 01:00:05,092
It won't always be like this, Fran.

698
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:07,377
I love you.

699
01:00:07,513 --> 01:00:09,754
Careful. Lipstick.

700
01:00:11,099 --> 01:00:13,137
Merry Christmas.

701
01:00:28,572 --> 01:00:30,612
(Sighs)

702
01:00:40,167 --> 01:00:42,207
("Jealous Lover")

703
01:00:46,423 --> 01:00:48,463
(Sniffs)

704
01:01:00,103 --> 01:01:02,143
(Sobs)

705
01:02:24,932 --> 01:02:26,971
(Big band blues)

706
01:02:39,737 --> 01:02:43,353
- Drink up, pop. It's closing time.
- But it's early, Charlie.

707
01:02:43,489 --> 01:02:47,073
- Don't you know what night this is?
- I know, Charlie. I know.

708
01:02:47,203 --> 01:02:49,241
I work for the outfit.

709
01:02:54,835 --> 01:02:57,585
Hey, knock it off, will ya? Go home.

710
01:03:05,801 --> 01:03:08,009
O-U-T. Out!

711
01:03:12,935 --> 01:03:15,602
Where'll we go? My place or yours?

712
01:03:18,232 --> 01:03:21,564
Might as well go to mine.
Everybody else does.

713
01:03:33,287 --> 01:03:38,660
Poor Mickey. When I think of him
all by himself in that jail in Havana...

714
01:03:38,791 --> 01:03:41,034
Would you like to see his picture?

715
01:03:41,169 --> 01:03:43,207
Not particularly.

716
01:03:44,588 --> 01:03:49,417
He's so cute. He's 5 foot 2, 99 pounds.

717
01:03:49,552 --> 01:03:51,591
Like a little Chihuahua.

718
01:04:04,399 --> 01:04:07,602
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- No.

719
01:04:07,735 --> 01:04:09,692
You got a girlfriend?

720
01:04:09,821 --> 01:04:12,691
She may be a girl
but she is no friend of mine.

721
01:04:12,824 --> 01:04:16,986
- Still stuck on her, huh?
- Obviously you don't know me very well.

722
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,864
- I don't know you at all.
- Permit me.

723
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:26,783
CC Baxter. Junior executive,
Arthur Murray graduate... lover.

724
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:30,288
I'm Mrs. MacDougall. Margie to you.

725
01:04:31,673 --> 01:04:33,713
This way, Mrs. MacDougall.

726
01:04:44,185 --> 01:04:47,020
Say! This is snugsville!

727
01:04:47,146 --> 01:04:49,768
Mrs. MacDougall,
it's only fair to warn you...

728
01:04:49,899 --> 01:04:53,267
..you are now alone
with a notorious sexpot.

729
01:04:53,402 --> 01:04:56,073
- No kiddin'!
- Ask anybody around here.

730
01:04:56,197 --> 01:05:00,277
As a matter of fact, when it's time for me
to go - and I may go just like that -

731
01:05:00,409 --> 01:05:03,327
I have promised my body
to the Columbia Medical Center.

732
01:05:03,454 --> 01:05:06,453
Gee! Sort of gives you goose bumps
just to think about it.

733
01:05:06,581 --> 01:05:09,867
They haven't got me yet, baby.
Dig up some ice from the kitchen.

734
01:05:10,002 --> 01:05:12,918
Let's not waste any more time
preliminary-wise.

735
01:05:13,045 --> 01:05:15,085
I'm with you, lover.

736
01:05:37,902 --> 01:05:39,977
(Latin-beat dance music)

737
01:05:40,112 --> 01:05:42,152
(Hums along)

738
01:06:31,702 --> 01:06:34,158
All right, Miss Kubelik. Get up.

739
01:06:34,954 --> 01:06:37,161
Come on. It's past checking-out time.

740
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:41,668
The management would appreciate it
if you'd get the hell outta here.

741
01:06:44,462 --> 01:06:49,802
I used to like you. I used to like you a lot.
Well, it's all over between us, so beat it.

742
01:06:50,469 --> 01:06:52,509
O-U-T, out!

743
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,720
Come on, wake up.

744
01:07:02,272 --> 01:07:04,312
Oh my God.

745
01:07:04,441 --> 01:07:06,479
Miss Kubelik?

746
01:07:07,193 --> 01:07:09,232
Miss Kubelik?

747
01:07:19,037 --> 01:07:21,953
I broke a nail tryin' to get the tray out.

748
01:07:22,081 --> 01:07:25,167
You oughta buy yourself
a new refrigerator.

749
01:07:27,586 --> 01:07:29,414
I didn't mean right now!

750
01:07:32,425 --> 01:07:34,464
Dr. Dreyfuss.

751
01:07:35,053 --> 01:07:37,091
Doc!

752
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:42,142
There's a girl in my place, took
some sleeping pills. I can't wake her up.

753
01:07:42,268 --> 01:07:44,307
- Let me get my bag.
- Hurry up!

754
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:49,847
Hey, over here, lover.
What's all the running around about?

755
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:52,652
You're gonna wear yourself out.

756
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:56,060
- Not so rough, honey!
- Good night.

757
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:58,237
- Good night?!
- The party's over.

758
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:00,571
What? Did I do somethin' wrong?

759
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:04,034
It's an emergency.
I'll see you some other time.

760
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:06,201
Not this one. In there, Doc.

761
01:08:07,207 --> 01:08:10,955
- What's goin' on here, anyway?
- Will you please just get out?!

762
01:08:11,086 --> 01:08:12,627
My shoes!

763
01:08:12,754 --> 01:08:15,754
Some lover you are! Some sexpot!

764
01:08:15,881 --> 01:08:18,634
Here. Find a phone.
Call your husband in Havana.

765
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:24,215
You bet I will! And when I tell him how
you treated me, he'll push your face in!

766
01:08:24,348 --> 01:08:26,387
You fink!

767
01:08:41,947 --> 01:08:43,987
Is she gonna be all right, Doc?

768
01:08:44,116 --> 01:08:48,161
- How many pills were in that bottle?
- It was half-full. About a dozen.

769
01:08:48,287 --> 01:08:51,287
- Do you have to take her to the hospital?
- Help me, will you?

770
01:08:51,414 --> 01:08:54,084
- Into the bathroom.
- What are you gonna do?

771
01:08:54,209 --> 01:08:56,996
Get that stuff out of her stomach
if it isn't too late.

772
01:08:57,128 --> 01:08:59,796
You'd better put some coffee on,
and pray.

773
01:09:29,617 --> 01:09:31,656
(Fran vomits and coughs)

774
01:09:54,724 --> 01:09:56,763
Bring my bag.

775
01:10:06,609 --> 01:10:08,649
Roll up her right sleeve.

776
01:10:18,453 --> 01:10:20,493
Hold that.

777
01:10:27,505 --> 01:10:29,542
Nice veins.

778
01:10:41,309 --> 01:10:44,143
Wanna tell me what happened?

779
01:10:44,269 --> 01:10:46,937
I don't know. I mean, I wasn't even here.

780
01:10:49,984 --> 01:10:53,766
You see, we had... some words earlier.

781
01:10:53,903 --> 01:10:58,031
It was nothin' serious.
You might call it a lovers' quarrel.

782
01:10:59,033 --> 01:11:01,949
So you went right out
and picked yourself up another dame.

783
01:11:02,077 --> 01:11:06,868
- Something like that.
- You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie pie.

784
01:11:06,998 --> 01:11:08,541
Yes, you are.

785
01:11:16,716 --> 01:11:21,840
If you'd come home half an hour later,
you'd have had quite a Christmas present.

786
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:40,066
(Kettle whistles)

787
01:11:40,655 --> 01:11:42,694
Get the coffee.

788
01:11:44,407 --> 01:11:46,447
(Fran moans)

789
01:12:06,302 --> 01:12:09,139
Let's get some air in here.
Open the windows.

790
01:12:12,267 --> 01:12:14,307
(Fran coughs)

791
01:12:24,445 --> 01:12:26,485
What's her name?

792
01:12:26,614 --> 01:12:29,317
Miss Kubelik. Fran.

793
01:12:32,702 --> 01:12:37,945
Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because
you took too many sleeping pills.

794
01:12:38,082 --> 01:12:40,289
Do you understand what I'm saying?

795
01:12:40,419 --> 01:12:41,914
(Fran moans)

796
01:12:42,046 --> 01:12:45,495
Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss.
I'm here to help you.

797
01:12:45,632 --> 01:12:48,548
You took all those sleeping pills.
Remember?

798
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:53,378
- Sleeping pills.
- That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.

799
01:12:54,223 --> 01:12:57,058
- Doctor?
- Dr. Dreyfuss.

800
01:12:59,561 --> 01:13:01,139
Dreyfuss.

801
01:13:01,271 --> 01:13:03,311
Get more coffee.

802
01:13:04,234 --> 01:13:06,687
Now tell me again. What's my name?

803
01:13:09,905 --> 01:13:12,276
Dr.... Dreyfuss.

804
01:13:12,406 --> 01:13:14,446
And what happened to you?

805
01:13:15,035 --> 01:13:16,741
I...

806
01:13:16,868 --> 01:13:18,909
I took sleeping pills.

807
01:13:19,497 --> 01:13:21,951
Do you know where you are?

808
01:13:23,959 --> 01:13:27,244
- No.
- Yes, you do, Fran. Now concentrate!

809
01:13:29,172 --> 01:13:31,212
I don't know.

810
01:13:32,133 --> 01:13:34,173
Do you know who that is?

811
01:13:40,933 --> 01:13:42,973
Look at him.

812
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:46,932
Mr. Baxter. 19th floor.

813
01:13:47,647 --> 01:13:49,687
Hello, Miss Kubelik.

814
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:52,688
Mr.? Miss? Such politeness!

815
01:13:53,986 --> 01:13:57,985
We work in the same building.
We try to keep it quiet.

816
01:13:59,658 --> 01:14:02,328
What are you doing here?

817
01:14:03,912 --> 01:14:07,661
Don't you remember
we were together at the office party?

818
01:14:07,791 --> 01:14:10,198
Oh, yes. The office party.

819
01:14:10,335 --> 01:14:12,909
- Miss Olsen.
- That's right.

820
01:14:13,047 --> 01:14:16,001
I told you we had a fight.
That was what it was about.

821
01:14:16,133 --> 01:14:19,467
Miss Olsen. That girl
that was here earlier.

822
01:14:21,052 --> 01:14:23,758
I don't understand.

823
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:29,263
The main thing is I got here in time and
you're gonna be all right. Isn't she, Doc?

824
01:14:30,188 --> 01:14:32,475
I'm so tired.

825
01:14:32,605 --> 01:14:34,646
Come on. Drink this.

826
01:14:35,025 --> 01:14:37,729
Please... just let me sleep.

827
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:41,644
No, you can't sleep! Fran, open your eyes!

828
01:14:42,323 --> 01:14:44,362
Let's get her walking.

829
01:14:47,035 --> 01:14:51,662
We've got to keep her awake for the next
few hours. Now come on, Fran, walk!

830
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:54,363
One, two, three, four!

831
01:14:54,501 --> 01:14:56,791
One, two, three, four!

832
01:14:56,921 --> 01:14:59,126
Left, right, left, right,...

833
01:14:59,255 --> 01:15:01,497
..left, right and return!

834
01:15:01,633 --> 01:15:04,835
And... one, two, three, four!

835
01:15:04,969 --> 01:15:08,384
Now you've got it! One, two, three, four!

836
01:15:08,514 --> 01:15:11,766
Walk, Fran! One, two, three, four!

837
01:15:11,894 --> 01:15:14,560
One, two... And return again.

838
01:15:14,686 --> 01:15:17,806
And... left, right, left, right.

839
01:15:25,029 --> 01:15:28,362
She'll sleep on and off
for the next 24 hours.

840
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:32,192
Of course, she'll have
a dandy hangover when she wakes up.

841
01:15:32,328 --> 01:15:34,369
Just as long as she's OK.

842
01:15:34,498 --> 01:15:40,002
These cases are harder on the doctor than
the patient. I oughta charge by the mile.

843
01:15:40,127 --> 01:15:43,212
- Any of that coffee left?
- Yeah, sure.

844
01:15:44,214 --> 01:15:46,668
How do you spell her last name?

845
01:15:46,798 --> 01:15:49,292
Kubelik. Two k's.

846
01:15:49,428 --> 01:15:51,466
What's her address?

847
01:15:52,221 --> 01:15:54,260
Where does she live?

848
01:15:55,265 --> 01:15:57,722
Why do you wanna know, Doc?

849
01:15:58,811 --> 01:16:01,977
- You don't have to report this, do you?
- It's regulations.

850
01:16:02,106 --> 01:16:07,099
But it was an accident. She had too much
to drink, didn't know what she was doing.

851
01:16:07,235 --> 01:16:09,393
There was no suicide note or anything.

852
01:16:09,529 --> 01:16:12,649
- I'm not thinkin' about myself.
- Aren't you?

853
01:16:12,782 --> 01:16:16,282
She's got a family,
and there's the people at the office.

854
01:16:16,411 --> 01:16:20,326
Can't you forget you're a doctor,
just say you're here as a neighbour?

855
01:16:20,457 --> 01:16:23,325
Well, as a doctor, I can't prove
it wasn't an accident.

856
01:16:23,458 --> 01:16:26,662
But as your neighbour,
I'd like to kick you around the block.

857
01:16:26,796 --> 01:16:29,332
- Mind if I cool this off?
- Help yourself.

858
01:16:29,463 --> 01:16:31,870
I don't know what you did to that girl,...

859
01:16:32,008 --> 01:16:34,546
..but it was bound to happen,
the way you carry on.

860
01:16:34,677 --> 01:16:37,132
Live now, pay later. Diners Club!

861
01:16:39,097 --> 01:16:42,052
Why don't you grow up, Baxter?
Be a mensch.

862
01:16:42,184 --> 01:16:44,591
- You know what that means?
- I'm not sure.

863
01:16:44,727 --> 01:16:46,767
A mensch/ A human being!

864
01:16:47,773 --> 01:16:50,808
So you got off easy this time.
So you were lucky.

865
01:16:50,941 --> 01:16:55,603
But you're not out of the woods yet,
because most of 'em try it again.

866
01:16:56,656 --> 01:16:59,230
Well, you know where I am
if you need me.

867
01:18:11,225 --> 01:18:14,013
Mr. Baxter! Open up already.

868
01:18:17,273 --> 01:18:19,266
Oh.

869
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,815
- Mrs. Lieberman.
- Who did you think it was? Kriss Kringle?

870
01:18:22,944 --> 01:18:25,067
What was going on here last night?

871
01:18:25,196 --> 01:18:28,564
- Last night?
- All that marching! Tramp, tramp, tramp!

872
01:18:28,698 --> 01:18:32,116
- Army manoeuvres maybe?
- I'll never invite those people again.

873
01:18:32,245 --> 01:18:36,457
What you get from renting to bachelors.
All night I didn't sleep ten minutes.

874
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:42,087
- And I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
- Don't worry. He was out on a case.

875
01:18:42,213 --> 01:18:47,337
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter. This is
a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.

876
01:18:47,467 --> 01:18:49,507
Come on, Oscar.

877
01:19:16,494 --> 01:19:21,154
Operator, I want White Plains,
New York. Mr. JD Sheldrake.

878
01:19:21,288 --> 01:19:23,329
Make that person-to-person.

879
01:19:28,131 --> 01:19:31,166
Five, four, three, two, one...

880
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:33,872
- Let her rip!
- (Phone rings)

881
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:35,636
I'll get the phone.

882
01:19:35,763 --> 01:19:38,716
Hey, Dad, why don't we
put a fly in the nose cone?

883
01:19:38,848 --> 01:19:41,765
- See if we can bring it back alive.
- That's a thought.

884
01:19:41,893 --> 01:19:45,972
Maybe we should put in two flies
and see if they'll propagate in orbit.

885
01:19:46,106 --> 01:19:50,268
- See if they'll what?
- Propagate. You know. Multiply.

886
01:19:50,402 --> 01:19:54,100
- Baby flies?
- Oh. Oh!

887
01:19:54,947 --> 01:19:57,520
- It's for you, Dad.
- Thanks, Jeff.

888
01:19:57,656 --> 01:20:00,860
A Mr. Baxter. Person-to-person.

889
01:20:00,993 --> 01:20:03,615
Come on. Help me round up some flies.

890
01:20:03,746 --> 01:20:08,490
- Hello? What's on your mind, Baxter?
- Something came up that's important.

891
01:20:08,626 --> 01:20:12,209
I think you should see me
at the apartment as soon as possible.

892
01:20:12,338 --> 01:20:16,086
- What's this all about?
- I didn't wanna tell you over the phone.

893
01:20:16,216 --> 01:20:21,339
But that certain party... You know
who I mean. I found her here last night.

894
01:20:21,471 --> 01:20:24,590
- She took an overdose of sleeping pills.
- What?!

895
01:20:25,975 --> 01:20:29,970
- What is it, Jeff? Who's on the phone?
- One of our employees had an accident.

896
01:20:30,104 --> 01:20:33,521
I don't know why they bother me
with these things on Christmas Day.

897
01:20:33,650 --> 01:20:35,476
Yes, Baxter.

898
01:20:35,609 --> 01:20:37,649
Just how serious is it?

899
01:20:37,778 --> 01:20:41,442
It was touch and go there for a while,
but she's sleeping it off now.

900
01:20:41,572 --> 01:20:44,573
I thought maybe you'd like to
be here when she wakes up.

901
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:50,120
That's impossible. You'll have to
handle the situation yourself, Baxter.

902
01:20:50,247 --> 01:20:54,660
- As a matter of fact, I'm counting on you.
- Yes, sir. I understand.

903
01:20:54,794 --> 01:20:59,170
She left a letter. Would you like me
to open it and read it to you?

904
01:20:59,298 --> 01:21:02,047
Well, it was just a suggestion.

905
01:21:02,174 --> 01:21:06,089
No, don't worry. I kept your name
out of it, so there'll be no trouble,...

906
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:08,677
..police-wise or newspaper-wise.

907
01:21:09,933 --> 01:21:14,309
You see, the doctor is a friend of mine,
so we were very lucky in that respect.

908
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:16,892
Actually, he thinks she's my girl.

909
01:21:17,773 --> 01:21:20,015
No, he just jumped to the conclusion.

910
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:22,986
Around here I'm known as
quite a ladies' man.

911
01:21:23,112 --> 01:21:27,359
Of course, we're not out of the woods yet.
Sometimes they try it again.

912
01:21:27,491 --> 01:21:31,405
Yes, sir. I'll do my best. It'll take her
a couple of days to fully recover...

913
01:21:31,536 --> 01:21:34,821
..and I may have a little problem
with the landlady.

914
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:38,992
OK, Mr. Sheldrake. I'll keep her
in the apartment as long as I can.

915
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:42,661
Isn't there some sort of message
you want me to give her?

916
01:21:43,131 --> 01:21:45,336
Well, I'll... think of something.

917
01:21:45,923 --> 01:21:48,047
Yes, sir. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

918
01:21:50,929 --> 01:21:52,969
I'm sorry.

919
01:21:53,724 --> 01:21:57,342
- I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
- What are you doing out of bed?

920
01:21:57,477 --> 01:22:00,680
I didn't know. I had no idea
this was your apartment.

921
01:22:00,813 --> 01:22:03,518
Here. Let me help you.

922
01:22:04,024 --> 01:22:06,064
Oh, I'm so ashamed.

923
01:22:06,193 --> 01:22:08,231
Why didn't you just let me die?

924
01:22:08,361 --> 01:22:13,947
What kind of talk is that? You got
a little overemotional, but you're fine now.

925
01:22:14,076 --> 01:22:15,534
Oh!

926
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:19,990
Oh, my head! It feels just like
a big wad of chewing gum.

927
01:22:20,123 --> 01:22:22,874
- What time is it?
- Two o'clock.

928
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,242
Oh, my dress. I have to go home.

929
01:22:25,378 --> 01:22:27,832
You're in no shape
to go anywhere but back to bed.

930
01:22:27,963 --> 01:22:30,455
- You don't want me here.
- Sure I do. I...

931
01:22:30,590 --> 01:22:33,710
It's always nice
to have company for Christmas.

932
01:22:33,844 --> 01:22:37,377
- I'm stronger than you are.
- I just wanna brush my teeth.

933
01:22:37,513 --> 01:22:41,049
Oh. Of course. I think I can find
a new toothbrush somewhere.

934
01:22:41,184 --> 01:22:43,852
Here. Put that on.

935
01:23:12,546 --> 01:23:16,295
- How about some breakfast?
- No. I don't want anything.

936
01:23:16,425 --> 01:23:18,465
I'll fix you some coffee.

937
01:23:18,594 --> 01:23:22,922
Oh! We're all out of coffee.
You had quite a lot last night.

938
01:23:23,055 --> 01:23:25,096
Back in a minute.

939
01:23:34,526 --> 01:23:36,850
Mrs. Dreyfuss,
could I borrow some coffee?

940
01:23:36,985 --> 01:23:40,769
- And an orange and a couple of eggs?
- Eggs, he asks me for! Oranges!

941
01:23:40,906 --> 01:23:45,401
What you need is a good horsewhipping!
From me the doctor has no secrets.

942
01:23:45,535 --> 01:23:47,777
Poor girl. How could you do such a thing?

943
01:23:47,913 --> 01:23:50,867
I didn't do anything. Honest. It's just...

944
01:23:51,749 --> 01:23:57,254
You take a girl out just for laughs and
she thinks you're serious marriage-wise.

945
01:23:57,380 --> 01:24:00,878
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger!

946
01:24:01,007 --> 01:24:04,092
But for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.

947
01:24:12,644 --> 01:24:14,387
Who are you calling?

948
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,643
My sister, to tell her
what happened to me.

949
01:24:16,772 --> 01:24:21,730
Wait a minute! Let's talk it over first.
Just what are you gonna tell her?

950
01:24:22,526 --> 01:24:26,477
- I haven't figured it out exactly.
- Well, you'd better figure it out exactly.

951
01:24:26,615 --> 01:24:29,699
Suppose she asks you why
you didn't come home last night.

952
01:24:29,826 --> 01:24:31,782
I'll say I spent the night with a friend.

953
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:33,951
- Who?
- Someone from the office.

954
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,908
- Where are you now?
- In his apartment.

955
01:24:36,041 --> 01:24:38,411
- In his apartment?
- In her apartment.

956
01:24:38,542 --> 01:24:40,749
- What's your friend's name?
- Baxter.

957
01:24:40,879 --> 01:24:43,961
- What's her first name?
- Miss.

958
01:24:44,089 --> 01:24:46,924
- When are you comin' home?
- As soon as I can walk.

959
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:49,090
- Your legs hurt?
- No, my stomach.

960
01:24:49,219 --> 01:24:52,006
- Your stomach?
- They had to pump it out!

961
01:24:52,138 --> 01:24:57,050
You shouldn't call anybody. Not till you
get the chewing gum out of your head.

962
01:24:57,186 --> 01:25:00,351
They'll be worried about me.
They might call the police.

963
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:03,683
We have to be careful.
We don't wanna involve anybody.

964
01:25:03,816 --> 01:25:06,900
After all, Mr. Sheldrake's a married man.

965
01:25:07,736 --> 01:25:09,775
Thanks for reminding me!

966
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:15,614
I didn't mean it that way.

967
01:25:15,743 --> 01:25:19,871
I was just talking to him on the phone.
He's very concerned about you.

968
01:25:19,997 --> 01:25:22,749
He doesn't give a damn about me.

969
01:25:22,876 --> 01:25:26,624
- You're wrong. He told me...
- He's a liar.

970
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:28,994
But that's not the worst part.

971
01:25:29,131 --> 01:25:31,504
The worst part is I still love him.

972
01:25:32,425 --> 01:25:34,466
(Doorbell)

973
01:25:35,554 --> 01:25:37,759
Oh. That must be Mrs. Dreyfuss.

974
01:25:37,889 --> 01:25:41,341
Remember the doctor from last night?
That's his wife.

975
01:25:43,061 --> 01:25:45,100
So where's the victim?

976
01:25:46,146 --> 01:25:48,186
Max the Knife!

977
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:55,066
- Nu, little lady, how are we feeling today?
- I don't know. Kind of dizzy.

978
01:25:55,198 --> 01:26:00,570
The best thing for dizzy is noodle soup
with chicken white meat and a glass tea.

979
01:26:00,702 --> 01:26:05,162
- No, thank you. I'm really not hungry.
- Go ahead, eat. Enjoy.

980
01:26:05,289 --> 01:26:08,207
You wouldn't have such a thing
as a napkin, would you?

981
01:26:08,334 --> 01:26:11,537
- I have some paper towels.
- Beatnik.

982
01:26:11,671 --> 01:26:15,169
In my kitchen, third drawer,
under the good silver, are napkins.

983
01:26:15,298 --> 01:26:16,674
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

984
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:19,421
So, what are you waiting for?
A singing commercial?

985
01:26:19,552 --> 01:26:21,592
- I can't eat.
- You must eat.

986
01:26:21,721 --> 01:26:24,887
And you must get healthy
and you must forget him.

987
01:26:25,015 --> 01:26:28,302
Such a fine boy he seemed
when he first moved in here.

988
01:26:28,437 --> 01:26:31,436
Clean and cut, a regular lvy Leaguer.

989
01:26:31,565 --> 01:26:36,025
Turns out he's King Farouk,
with the drinking, with the cha-cha.

990
01:26:36,151 --> 01:26:38,191
With the no napkins.

991
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:42,365
A girl like you, for the rest of your life
you wanna cry in your noodle soup?

992
01:26:42,491 --> 01:26:45,064
Who needs it? Now you listen to me.

993
01:26:45,201 --> 01:26:49,365
You'll find yourself a nice,
substantial man - a widower, maybe -

994
01:26:49,498 --> 01:26:53,162
and settle down, instead of
noshing all those sleeping pills.

995
01:26:53,292 --> 01:26:56,458
For what? For whom?
For some good-time Charlie?

996
01:26:56,586 --> 01:26:58,497
- (Door opens)
- Shh.

997
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:02,675
One napkin comin' up. Wish we had
some champagne to wrap it around.

998
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:05,968
- What did I tell you?
- Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait.

999
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:10,046
- I'll wash the dishes.
- You'd break 'em. I'll come back for them.

1000
01:27:10,184 --> 01:27:12,674
If he makes trouble, give me a yell.

1001
01:27:14,019 --> 01:27:17,852
- She doesn't seem to like you very much.
- Oh, I don't mind.

1002
01:27:17,982 --> 01:27:20,556
As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered.

1003
01:27:20,693 --> 01:27:25,853
That anybody'd think a girl like you would
do a thing like this over a guy like me.

1004
01:27:27,074 --> 01:27:30,157
Did you find something here?
An envelope?

1005
01:27:30,284 --> 01:27:31,863
Yes. I've got it.

1006
01:27:31,995 --> 01:27:36,371
Don't you think we'd better destroy it
so it won't fall in the wrong hands?

1007
01:27:36,498 --> 01:27:38,538
Open it.

1008
01:27:42,213 --> 01:27:44,785
There's nothing here but a $100 bill.

1009
01:27:44,923 --> 01:27:48,292
That's right. Will you see
that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?

1010
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:51,508
Sure.

1011
01:27:53,015 --> 01:27:55,053
Take this away, will you?

1012
01:27:55,766 --> 01:27:58,637
Would you like me to move
the television set in here?

1013
01:27:58,769 --> 01:28:01,521
- You play gin rummy?
- I'm not very good at it.

1014
01:28:01,647 --> 01:28:05,645
- I am. Let me get the cards.
- You don't have to entertain me.

1015
01:28:05,776 --> 01:28:09,525
There's nothing I'd like better.
You know. Togetherness.

1016
01:28:09,655 --> 01:28:14,363
Guess what I did last Christmas. Had
dinner at the automat, went to the zoo,...

1017
01:28:14,493 --> 01:28:17,279
..then came home and cleaned up
after Mr. Eichelberger.

1018
01:28:17,412 --> 01:28:19,786
He had a little eggnog party here.

1019
01:28:19,916 --> 01:28:22,202
So I'm way ahead this year.

1020
01:28:22,332 --> 01:28:25,084
Three across. Spades double?

1021
01:28:25,211 --> 01:28:27,250
High deals.

1022
01:28:27,921 --> 01:28:29,960
Six? Eight.

1023
01:28:37,972 --> 01:28:40,844
I think I'm gonna give it all up.

1024
01:28:42,102 --> 01:28:43,843
Give what up?

1025
01:28:46,898 --> 01:28:49,899
Why do people have to
love people, anyway?

1026
01:28:51,318 --> 01:28:53,358
I know what you mean.

1027
01:28:56,616 --> 01:28:58,654
Queen.

1028
01:29:01,411 --> 01:29:03,867
- I don't want it.
- Pick a card.

1029
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:13,087
What do you call it when somebody keeps
gettin' smashed up in car accidents?

1030
01:29:13,214 --> 01:29:16,498
- Bad insurance risk?
- That's me with men.

1031
01:29:18,177 --> 01:29:22,968
I was jinxed from the word go. First time
I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.

1032
01:29:23,098 --> 01:29:25,222
A cemetery?

1033
01:29:25,351 --> 01:29:28,102
I was 15. We used to go there to smoke.

1034
01:29:28,228 --> 01:29:32,355
His name was George and
he threw me over for a drum majorette.

1035
01:29:33,817 --> 01:29:35,856
Uh, gin.

1036
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:44,570
That's 10, 20... 36.
And 25 makes 61 and two boxes.

1037
01:29:44,701 --> 01:29:46,778
I have this talent for falling in love...

1038
01:29:46,912 --> 01:29:50,363
..with the wrong guy
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

1039
01:29:51,125 --> 01:29:53,282
Well, how many guys were there?

1040
01:29:54,501 --> 01:29:56,330
Three.

1041
01:29:56,463 --> 01:30:00,411
The last one was the manager of a finance
company back home in Pittsburgh.

1042
01:30:00,549 --> 01:30:02,589
They found a shortage in his accounts.

1043
01:30:02,718 --> 01:30:06,466
He asked me to wait for him.
He'll be out in 1965.

1044
01:30:08,014 --> 01:30:10,054
Cut.

1045
01:30:10,725 --> 01:30:15,802
So I came to New York and moved in with
my sister and her husband, a cab driver.

1046
01:30:15,938 --> 01:30:20,814
They sent me to secretarial school and
then I applied for a job at Consolidated.

1047
01:30:20,943 --> 01:30:23,150
But I flunked the typing test.

1048
01:30:23,279 --> 01:30:26,066
- Too slow?
- No. I can type up a storm.

1049
01:30:26,197 --> 01:30:28,238
I just can't spell.

1050
01:30:29,284 --> 01:30:34,361
So they gave me a pair of white gloves
and stuck me in an elevator.

1051
01:30:34,499 --> 01:30:36,952
And that's how I met Jeff.

1052
01:30:38,168 --> 01:30:40,836
Oh God, I'm so fouled up.

1053
01:30:40,962 --> 01:30:43,370
What am I gonna do now?

1054
01:30:45,590 --> 01:30:47,798
Better win a hand. You're on a blitz.

1055
01:30:49,427 --> 01:30:52,298
Was he very upset when you told him?

1056
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:54,470
Mr. Sheldrake? Yeah, very.

1057
01:30:55,767 --> 01:30:59,466
Maybe he does love me, only he doesn't
have the nerve to tell his wife.

1058
01:30:59,604 --> 01:31:01,063
I'm sure that's it.

1059
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:04,558
- You really think so?
- No doubt about it.

1060
01:31:05,985 --> 01:31:08,273
Would you hand me that pad and pencil?

1061
01:31:08,403 --> 01:31:11,441
- What for?
- I'm gonna write to Mrs. Sheldrake.

1062
01:31:11,574 --> 01:31:13,897
- You what?
- As one woman to another.

1063
01:31:14,033 --> 01:31:17,984
- I'm sure she'll understand.
- I don't think that's a very good idea.

1064
01:31:18,121 --> 01:31:21,536
- Why not?
- For one thing, you can't spell.

1065
01:31:21,667 --> 01:31:25,794
Secondly, if you did something
like that, you'd hate yourself.

1066
01:31:26,963 --> 01:31:29,632
I don't like myself very much anyway.

1067
01:31:31,591 --> 01:31:34,000
Pick up the cards. Let's go.

1068
01:31:34,137 --> 01:31:37,220
- Do I have to?
- You bet. I got a terrific hand.

1069
01:31:43,978 --> 01:31:46,849
- You really wanna discard that?
- Sure.

1070
01:31:46,981 --> 01:31:48,808
Gin.

1071
01:31:51,526 --> 01:31:53,021
(Hums nervously)

1072
01:31:53,153 --> 01:31:58,112
10, 20, 40, 52 and 25... 77.

1073
01:31:58,867 --> 01:32:02,319
Spades are double... 154.

1074
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:09,539
Blitzed. Two games.

1075
01:33:10,851 --> 01:33:13,058
(Sylvia hums along to dance music)

1076
01:33:31,412 --> 01:33:33,451
(Doorbell)

1077
01:33:39,710 --> 01:33:42,996
- (Doorbell)
- All right, all right, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

1078
01:33:50,513 --> 01:33:52,339
- Hi, Baxter.
- What do you want?

1079
01:33:52,472 --> 01:33:54,512
What do I want? Just a minute.

1080
01:33:54,641 --> 01:33:57,311
- You can't come in!
- What's the matter with you?

1081
01:33:57,436 --> 01:33:59,512
I made a reservation for four o'clock.

1082
01:33:59,645 --> 01:34:01,971
You can't stay.
Take your champagne and go.

1083
01:34:02,106 --> 01:34:05,641
I don't wanna pull rank on you,
but I told the little lady it was all set.

1084
01:34:05,777 --> 01:34:09,478
Are you gonna leave, Mr. Kirkeby,
or do I have to throw you out?

1085
01:34:10,446 --> 01:34:13,200
(Sniggers) Buddy-boy,
why didn't you say so?

1086
01:34:13,326 --> 01:34:16,693
- Got yourself a little playmate, huh?
- Now will you get out?

1087
01:34:16,828 --> 01:34:18,868
(Sylvia hums dance music)

1088
01:34:22,334 --> 01:34:25,703
Hey, come on! What are we waiting for?
Open up, will you?

1089
01:34:25,837 --> 01:34:27,877
(Dr. Dreyfuss) Mildred!

1090
01:34:29,465 --> 01:34:33,925
- What's holding things up?
- Say, let's have a party, the four of us.

1091
01:34:34,052 --> 01:34:36,093
No!

1092
01:34:40,309 --> 01:34:42,633
(Sniggers) Well, I don't blame you.

1093
01:34:42,769 --> 01:34:45,770
So you hit the jackpot, eh, kid?
I mean Kubelik-wise.

1094
01:34:45,897 --> 01:34:48,352
Don't worry.
I won't say a word to anybody.

1095
01:34:48,733 --> 01:34:50,774
Stay with it, Buddy-boy.

1096
01:35:05,874 --> 01:35:07,914
Who was that?

1097
01:35:08,627 --> 01:35:12,126
Just somebody delivering
a bottle of champagne. Like some?

1098
01:35:13,006 --> 01:35:15,674
Would you mind opening that window?

1099
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:23,808
- Now don't get any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
- I just want some fresh air.

1100
01:35:23,933 --> 01:35:27,302
It's only one storey down.
The best you could do is break a leg.

1101
01:35:27,436 --> 01:35:30,140
So they'll shoot me, like a horse.

1102
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:33,849
Please, you gotta promise me
you won't do anything foolish.

1103
01:35:33,983 --> 01:35:36,438
- Who'd care?
- I would.

1104
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:46,114
Why can't I ever fall in love
with somebody nice like you?

1105
01:35:47,037 --> 01:35:49,076
Yeah. Well...

1106
01:35:49,749 --> 01:35:52,700
That's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise.

1107
01:35:54,085 --> 01:35:56,541
Go to sleep.

1108
01:36:30,702 --> 01:36:35,447
- (Women) Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Miss Olsen, come into my office, please.

1109
01:36:44,882 --> 01:36:48,832
- Did you have a nice Christmas?
- Lovely. You were a great help!

1110
01:36:48,969 --> 01:36:51,638
Your pep talk to Miss Kubelik
at the office party.

1111
01:36:51,764 --> 01:36:56,391
- Sorry, Jeff. I never could hold my liquor.
- I thought you could hold your tongue.

1112
01:36:56,519 --> 01:36:59,055
- It won't happen again.
- You bet it won't.

1113
01:36:59,187 --> 01:37:02,141
I'll arrange for you to get
a month's severance pay.

1114
01:37:02,274 --> 01:37:05,274
That's right, Miss Olsen.
I'm letting you go.

1115
01:37:06,028 --> 01:37:08,600
You let me go four years ago, Jeff.

1116
01:37:08,737 --> 01:37:13,151
And were cruel enough to make me sit out
there and watch the new models pass by.

1117
01:37:13,284 --> 01:37:16,450
I'd appreciate it if you'd be
out of here as soon as you can.

1118
01:37:16,578 --> 01:37:18,618
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

1119
01:37:27,422 --> 01:37:31,633
Operator, this is Mr. Sheldrake. I'd like
Mr. Baxter's home telephone number.

1120
01:37:31,759 --> 01:37:34,631
He's in Ordinary Premium Accounting.

1121
01:37:50,027 --> 01:37:53,609
- (Baxter) Hello?
- Hello. Jeff Sheldrake. Can you talk?

1122
01:37:54,363 --> 01:37:56,190
Yes. She's in the shower.

1123
01:37:56,324 --> 01:37:59,028
- She's coming along fine, considering.
- Good.

1124
01:37:59,159 --> 01:38:02,825
- Is there anything you need? Money?
- No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake.

1125
01:38:02,955 --> 01:38:06,122
As a matter of fact, I have
some money for you. $100.

1126
01:38:06,250 --> 01:38:07,660
Oh.

1127
01:38:07,792 --> 01:38:11,625
- If there's anything I can do for you...
- For me? I don't think so.

1128
01:38:11,754 --> 01:38:14,506
But I was hoping maybe
you could do something for her.

1129
01:38:14,799 --> 01:38:18,167
Like what? Put yourself
in my place, Baxter.

1130
01:38:18,302 --> 01:38:20,509
How can I help her? My hands are tied.

1131
01:38:21,806 --> 01:38:24,261
Well... at least you can talk to her.

1132
01:38:25,393 --> 01:38:28,973
Let me put her on. And please, be gentle.

1133
01:38:29,688 --> 01:38:32,178
There's a call for you!

1134
01:38:32,315 --> 01:38:34,772
- For me?
- Yeah. Mr. Sheldrake.

1135
01:38:36,736 --> 01:38:38,775
I don't wanna talk to him.

1136
01:38:38,905 --> 01:38:40,862
I think you should.

1137
01:38:40,991 --> 01:38:46,328
I gotta run down to the grocery anyway.
There's nothing left here but frozen pizza.

1138
01:38:47,162 --> 01:38:49,201
I'll be right back. OK?

1139
01:39:09,683 --> 01:39:11,722
Hello, Jeff.

1140
01:39:13,187 --> 01:39:16,354
- Yes, I'm all right.
- Why did you do it, Fran?

1141
01:39:16,482 --> 01:39:18,972
It's so childish,
and it never solves anything.

1142
01:39:19,109 --> 01:39:21,778
I oughta be very angry with you,
scaring me that way.

1143
01:39:21,903 --> 01:39:26,696
But let's forget the whole thing, pretend
it never happened. What do you say?

1144
01:39:26,824 --> 01:39:28,863
Fran?

1145
01:39:29,327 --> 01:39:31,864
Are you there, Fran?

1146
01:39:33,372 --> 01:39:37,868
Of course I'm not here, because
the whole thing never happened.

1147
01:39:38,001 --> 01:39:41,868
I never took those pills,
I never loved you,...

1148
01:39:42,005 --> 01:39:44,247
..we never even met.

1149
01:39:45,426 --> 01:39:49,470
- Isn't that the way you want it, Jeff?
- You know I didn't mean it that way.

1150
01:39:49,597 --> 01:39:52,430
You just get well.
Do what the nurse says. I mean Baxter.

1151
01:39:52,556 --> 01:39:55,640
I'll see you as soon as I can.
Goodbye, Fran.

1152
01:40:13,992 --> 01:40:16,567
Hello, Mrs. Sheldrake. This is Miss Olsen.

1153
01:40:16,704 --> 01:40:20,868
Fine, thank you. I was wondering
if we could have lunch together.

1154
01:40:21,751 --> 01:40:25,451
I don't know how important it is,
but you might find it educational.

1155
01:40:25,587 --> 01:40:28,292
It concerns your husband.

1156
01:40:28,424 --> 01:40:32,123
All right. One o'clock,
Longchamps, Madison and 59th.

1157
01:40:38,432 --> 01:40:40,674
Don't worry. I'm on my way.

1158
01:40:40,810 --> 01:40:42,848
Just making a personal call.

1159
01:40:44,563 --> 01:40:46,603
Here's a dime.

1160
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:50,943
Going down.

1161
01:41:03,329 --> 01:41:05,952
Oh, Mr. Baxter! I'm glad you're here.

1162
01:41:06,083 --> 01:41:08,703
- I was just going to get the passkey.
- What for?

1163
01:41:08,835 --> 01:41:11,670
I thought I smelled gas
coming from your apartment.

1164
01:41:11,796 --> 01:41:13,837
Gas?!

1165
01:41:22,933 --> 01:41:24,972
Miss Kubelik?

1166
01:41:26,852 --> 01:41:28,892
Miss Kubelik!

1167
01:41:31,607 --> 01:41:33,647
- You all right?
- Sure!

1168
01:41:34,568 --> 01:41:37,732
- What's that funny smell?
- Gas! Didn't you turn it on?

1169
01:41:37,862 --> 01:41:40,862
Yes, to boil water to get
the coffee stains out of my dress.

1170
01:41:40,990 --> 01:41:44,406
- You turned it on but you didn't light it.
- Are you supposed to?

1171
01:41:44,535 --> 01:41:48,366
In this house you're supposed to.
Hey, what are you doing with that?

1172
01:41:48,497 --> 01:41:51,948
I was washing my stockings,
so I thought I'd wash your socks too.

1173
01:41:52,083 --> 01:41:56,248
- Oh. Thank you.
- Very curious. I could only find 3 pair.

1174
01:41:56,380 --> 01:41:58,871
Things are a little disorganised
around here.

1175
01:41:59,006 --> 01:42:02,874
I'd say. What's a tennis racket
doing in the kitchen?

1176
01:42:03,010 --> 01:42:07,922
Tennis racket? Oh, I remember.
I was cooking myself an ltalian dinner.

1177
01:42:08,057 --> 01:42:10,808
I used it to strain the spaghetti.

1178
01:42:10,934 --> 01:42:13,509
- Why not?
- In fact, I'm a pretty good cook.

1179
01:42:13,646 --> 01:42:16,433
- Only I'm a lousy housekeeper.
- Yes, you are.

1180
01:42:16,566 --> 01:42:20,978
When I was straightening up the couch,
I found six hairpins, a lipstick,...

1181
01:42:21,111 --> 01:42:24,774
..a pair of false eyelashes and
a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.

1182
01:42:24,904 --> 01:42:28,241
It's just that I'm the kind of guy
who can't say no.

1183
01:42:28,369 --> 01:42:32,447
- I don't mean to girls. I mean...
- To someone like Mr. Sheldrake.

1184
01:42:32,581 --> 01:42:35,663
- I guess so.
- I know so.

1185
01:42:37,376 --> 01:42:39,830
- He's a taker.
- What?

1186
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:42,663
Some people take, some people get took.

1187
01:42:42,798 --> 01:42:46,842
And they know they're gettin' took
and there's nothin' they can do about it.

1188
01:42:46,968 --> 01:42:49,008
I wouldn't say that.

1189
01:42:49,764 --> 01:42:51,802
What would you like for dinner, huh?

1190
01:42:51,932 --> 01:42:55,135
Hey. Onion soup, and canned asparagus...

1191
01:42:55,269 --> 01:42:57,307
I really should be getting home.

1192
01:42:57,436 --> 01:43:00,438
- My family'll be flipping by now.
- You can't leave yet.

1193
01:43:00,565 --> 01:43:04,942
The doctor said it takes 48 hours
to get that stuff out of your system.

1194
01:43:06,029 --> 01:43:10,322
How long does it take to get someone
you're stuck on out of your system?

1195
01:43:10,449 --> 01:43:13,403
If only they'd invent
some kind of pump for that.

1196
01:43:13,535 --> 01:43:19,158
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You
think it's the end of the world. But it's not.

1197
01:43:19,290 --> 01:43:21,864
I went through exactly
the same thing myself.

1198
01:43:22,001 --> 01:43:23,958
- You did?
- Well, not exactly the same.

1199
01:43:24,087 --> 01:43:25,829
I tried to do it with a gun.

1200
01:43:25,962 --> 01:43:29,081
- Over a girl?
- Worse. It was the wife of my best friend.

1201
01:43:29,214 --> 01:43:34,256
And I was mad about her. But I knew
it was hopeless and I decided to end it all.

1202
01:43:34,386 --> 01:43:38,515
I went to a pawnshop and I bought a .45
automatic and I drove up to Eden Park...

1203
01:43:38,641 --> 01:43:40,763
- Do you know Cincinnati?
- No, I don't.

1204
01:43:40,892 --> 01:43:43,563
Anyway, I parked the car
and I loaded that gun...

1205
01:43:43,688 --> 01:43:48,065
You read in the papers that people shoot
themselves. Believe me, it's not that easy.

1206
01:43:48,191 --> 01:43:51,809
I mean, how do you do it?
Here? Here? Here?

1207
01:43:53,196 --> 01:43:55,865
- Know where I finally shot myself?
- Where?

1208
01:43:55,990 --> 01:43:57,899
- Here.
- In the knee?!

1209
01:43:58,033 --> 01:44:00,572
Yeah! I was sittin' there, tryin' to decide.

1210
01:44:00,703 --> 01:44:03,075
A cop came up because
I was illegally parked.

1211
01:44:03,205 --> 01:44:06,573
I tried to hide the gun
under the seat and it went off.

1212
01:44:06,708 --> 01:44:10,375
- That's terrible!
- It was a year till I could bend the knee.

1213
01:44:10,505 --> 01:44:13,624
But I got over the girl in three weeks.

1214
01:44:15,175 --> 01:44:18,959
Still lives in Cincinnati.
Has four kids and gained 20 pounds.

1215
01:44:19,096 --> 01:44:21,503
Sends me a fruitcake every Christmas.

1216
01:44:21,638 --> 01:44:24,095
Are you just making this up
to make me feel better?

1217
01:44:24,226 --> 01:44:26,265
Of course not! Here's the fruitcake.

1218
01:44:26,394 --> 01:44:28,601
- Do you wanna see my knee?
- No, thank you.

1219
01:44:28,730 --> 01:44:32,015
The fellas in the office might
get the wrong idea how I found out.

1220
01:44:32,149 --> 01:44:36,277
Let 'em! Look, I'm gonna cook dinner
for us. We'll have fruitcake for dessert.

1221
01:44:36,403 --> 01:44:39,652
You just sit there and rest.
You've done enough for today.

1222
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:43,032
- Yes, Nurse.
- (Baxter hums opera music)

1223
01:44:57,173 --> 01:45:00,421
- Can I help you?
- I'm lookin' for Miss Kubelik.

1224
01:45:00,551 --> 01:45:05,758
- So am I. She didn't report this morning.
- She didn't? Who's in charge here?

1225
01:45:05,890 --> 01:45:10,266
That comes under General Office
Administration. Mr. Dobisch, 21st floor.

1226
01:45:10,393 --> 01:45:12,135
Thanks.

1227
01:45:14,647 --> 01:45:19,143
So I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and
guess who he's stashed in the bedroom.

1228
01:45:19,276 --> 01:45:20,557
- Who?
- Kubelik.

1229
01:45:20,694 --> 01:45:23,813
No kiddin'? Buddy-boy and Kubelik
having a little toot?

1230
01:45:23,947 --> 01:45:28,444
Toot? More like a lost weekend.
Neither of 'em showed up for work today.

1231
01:45:28,577 --> 01:45:30,236
AWOL, hm?

1232
01:45:30,370 --> 01:45:32,943
What gripes me is
they guzzled my champagne...

1233
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:36,614
..while Sylvia and I wound up
at the Guggenheim Museum.

1234
01:45:38,294 --> 01:45:40,333
- Mr. Dobisch?
- Yeah.

1235
01:45:41,381 --> 01:45:45,591
I'm Karl Matuschka. My sister-in-law
runs one of the elevators. Fran Kubelik.

1236
01:45:45,717 --> 01:45:47,211
- Miss Kubelik?
- You know her?

1237
01:45:47,344 --> 01:45:51,212
Of course. We have a lot of employees,
but we're one big, happy family.

1238
01:45:51,348 --> 01:45:56,473
She lives with us, and my wife's nervous
cos Fran hasn't been home for two days.

1239
01:45:56,603 --> 01:45:57,978
That so?

1240
01:45:58,104 --> 01:46:01,187
So we wondered if somebody here
knew what happened to her.

1241
01:46:01,314 --> 01:46:02,775
I see.

1242
01:46:02,901 --> 01:46:06,518
What do you think, Al?
Can we help the man?

1243
01:46:06,652 --> 01:46:10,069
Why not? We don't owe
Buddy-boy anything.

1244
01:46:10,199 --> 01:46:13,698
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy
done for us lately?

1245
01:46:15,870 --> 01:46:18,242
Who is Buddy-boy?

1246
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:21,580
(Hums opera music)

1247
01:46:42,437 --> 01:46:46,303
- Are we dressing for dinner?
- No. Just come as you are.

1248
01:46:46,439 --> 01:46:50,568
- You're pretty good with that racket.
- You should see my backhand.

1249
01:46:52,612 --> 01:46:55,613
Wait till you see me serve the meatballs.

1250
01:46:55,740 --> 01:46:59,820
- Shall I light the candles?
- It's a must, gracious living-wise.

1251
01:46:59,952 --> 01:47:01,993
(Hums opera music)

1252
01:47:03,039 --> 01:47:04,449
# Meatball

1253
01:47:04,581 --> 01:47:06,621
(Hums)

1254
01:47:08,211 --> 01:47:09,834
Meatball

1255
01:47:09,961 --> 01:47:12,002
(Baxter continues humming)

1256
01:47:18,887 --> 01:47:21,888
- You bought some napkins.
- Might as well go all the way.

1257
01:47:22,015 --> 01:47:24,054
(Baxter hums)

1258
01:47:25,310 --> 01:47:27,717
You know, I used to live
like Robinson Crusoe.

1259
01:47:27,854 --> 01:47:30,094
Shipwrecked, among eight million people.

1260
01:47:30,230 --> 01:47:33,397
And then one day I saw
a footprint in the sand...

1261
01:47:33,525 --> 01:47:35,565
..and there you were.

1262
01:47:36,487 --> 01:47:38,728
It's a wonderful thing, dinner for two.

1263
01:47:38,863 --> 01:47:42,731
- Do you usually eat alone?
- No. Sometimes I eat with Ed Sullivan.

1264
01:47:42,868 --> 01:47:45,703
Or sometimes Dinah Shore
or Perry Como.

1265
01:47:45,829 --> 01:47:49,827
The other night it was Mae West.
She was much younger then. Cheers.

1266
01:47:49,959 --> 01:47:52,791
- Cheers.
- Know what we're gonna do after dinner?

1267
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:55,036
- The dishes.
- I mean after that.

1268
01:47:55,171 --> 01:47:57,460
- What?
- You don't have to if you don't want to.

1269
01:47:57,590 --> 01:47:59,996
- Oh, I don't?
- We're gonna finish the gin game.

1270
01:48:00,133 --> 01:48:02,802
- So keep a clear head.
- (Doorbell)

1271
01:48:03,637 --> 01:48:07,680
Cos I don't wanna take advantage of you,
the way I did yesterday in bed.

1272
01:48:07,806 --> 01:48:09,929
- Baxter?
- Yes.

1273
01:48:19,068 --> 01:48:21,772
What's with you, Fran?
Did you forget where you live?

1274
01:48:21,904 --> 01:48:25,604
- My brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
- Oh! How do you do, Mr. Matusch...

1275
01:48:25,741 --> 01:48:30,152
- Get dressed. I got the cab downstairs.
- Wait. I know what you're thinking, but...

1276
01:48:30,285 --> 01:48:33,074
It's none of my business
what you do. You're over 21.

1277
01:48:33,206 --> 01:48:36,823
- But your sister thinks you're a lady.
- All we were gonna do was eat!

1278
01:48:36,959 --> 01:48:39,450
If there wasn't a lady present,
I'd clobber you.

1279
01:48:39,586 --> 01:48:42,457
All right, Karl! I'll get dressed.

1280
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:53,720
Want a martini?

1281
01:48:57,729 --> 01:49:01,595
How about some spaghetti
with meat sauce that I cooked myself?

1282
01:49:07,111 --> 01:49:09,898
Your sister-in-law sure is terrific.

1283
01:49:13,159 --> 01:49:17,702
It must be murder drivin' a cab
in New York with the cross-town traffic.

1284
01:49:17,830 --> 01:49:19,870
(Door opens)

1285
01:49:22,167 --> 01:49:24,206
Hi, Baxter. How's the patient?

1286
01:49:24,337 --> 01:49:26,329
Oh, uh... I'm fine, Doc.

1287
01:49:26,465 --> 01:49:28,502
Not you. Miss Kubelik.

1288
01:49:29,256 --> 01:49:34,215
- What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
- This is Mr. Matuschka. He's... got a cab.

1289
01:49:34,346 --> 01:49:36,801
- Fran been sick?
- No. Just a little accident.

1290
01:49:36,932 --> 01:49:40,881
- What does he mean, accident?
- Well... these things happen all the time.

1291
01:49:41,019 --> 01:49:43,177
What things? What kind
of a doctor are you?

1292
01:49:43,313 --> 01:49:46,516
Not that kind! He just gave her
a shot, pumped out her stomach.

1293
01:49:46,649 --> 01:49:49,852
- What for?
- I took sleeping pills. But I'm fine now.

1294
01:49:49,985 --> 01:49:52,558
- Why'd you take sleeping pills?
- On account of me.

1295
01:49:52,695 --> 01:49:54,735
You?

1296
01:49:54,864 --> 01:49:56,656
Who else?

1297
01:50:01,537 --> 01:50:03,577
Leave him alone!

1298
01:50:05,958 --> 01:50:09,244
Oh, you fool. You damn fool.

1299
01:50:11,380 --> 01:50:14,465
- (Karl) Come on, Fran.
- Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.

1300
01:50:20,431 --> 01:50:22,469
Goodbye, Doctor.

1301
01:50:24,393 --> 01:50:29,137
Well, I don't wanna gloat, but
just between us, you had it coming to you.

1302
01:50:29,855 --> 01:50:31,314
(Tuts)

1303
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:34,358
You're gonna have a shiner tomorrow.

1304
01:50:34,485 --> 01:50:36,313
Let me get my bag.

1305
01:50:38,446 --> 01:50:40,487
Don't bother, Doc.

1306
01:50:40,616 --> 01:50:42,656
It doesn't hurt a bit.

1307
01:51:04,471 --> 01:51:06,795
Mr. Sheldrake's office? This is CC Baxter.

1308
01:51:06,931 --> 01:51:10,182
Please tell him I'd like to
come up and see him. It's important.

1309
01:51:10,310 --> 01:51:12,349
Will you call me back, please?

1310
01:51:15,147 --> 01:51:18,184
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1311
01:51:19,402 --> 01:51:21,441
All your troubles are over.

1312
01:51:22,654 --> 01:51:25,488
I'm gonna take Miss Kubelik
off your hands.

1313
01:51:26,324 --> 01:51:28,781
The plain fact is, I love her.

1314
01:51:29,702 --> 01:51:32,276
I thought you should be the first to know.

1315
01:51:32,413 --> 01:51:35,332
After all, you don't really
want her, and I do.

1316
01:51:35,459 --> 01:51:39,586
And though it may sound presumptuous,
she needs somebody like me.

1317
01:51:39,712 --> 01:51:43,163
- So I think it would be best all around.
- (Phone rings)

1318
01:51:43,299 --> 01:51:44,756
Solution-wise.

1319
01:51:44,883 --> 01:51:46,164
Yes?

1320
01:51:46,302 --> 01:51:48,459
I'll be right up.

1321
01:51:48,594 --> 01:51:51,965
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1322
01:51:52,099 --> 01:51:54,138
All your troubles are over.

1323
01:51:58,438 --> 01:52:00,679
19.

1324
01:52:00,815 --> 01:52:04,515
- Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
- Hit by a swinging door?

1325
01:52:04,651 --> 01:52:07,569
- Or a yellow cab?
- That guy really must've belted him.

1326
01:52:07,696 --> 01:52:10,900
Yeah. He's punchy. Talking to himself.

1327
01:52:11,158 --> 01:52:12,533
27.

1328
01:52:12,659 --> 01:52:15,114
Those two days
she spent in the apartment...

1329
01:52:15,244 --> 01:52:18,246
..made me realise
how lonely I'd been before.

1330
01:52:18,373 --> 01:52:21,907
But, thanks to you, I'm
in a financial position to marry her.

1331
01:52:22,042 --> 01:52:25,079
If I can ever square things with her family.

1332
01:52:25,213 --> 01:52:27,620
Good morning. CC Baxter.

1333
01:52:29,341 --> 01:52:31,463
(Intercom buzzer)

1334
01:52:31,593 --> 01:52:33,633
- Mr. Baxter is here.
- Send him in.

1335
01:52:35,889 --> 01:52:38,807
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1336
01:52:38,934 --> 01:52:41,056
And I've got good news for you, Baxter.

1337
01:52:41,185 --> 01:52:43,475
- All your troubles are over.
- Sir?

1338
01:52:43,815 --> 01:52:47,015
I know how worried you were
about Miss Kubelik. Stop worrying.

1339
01:52:47,150 --> 01:52:50,020
I'm going to take her off your hands.

1340
01:52:50,152 --> 01:52:53,070
- You're gonna take her off my hands?
- That's right.

1341
01:52:53,197 --> 01:52:55,653
I've moved out of the house.

1342
01:52:56,616 --> 01:52:59,617
I'm gonna be staying in town,
at the Athletic Club.

1343
01:52:59,744 --> 01:53:02,746
- You left your wife.
- If you must know, I fired my secretary.

1344
01:53:02,873 --> 01:53:07,699
My secretary got to my wife, and my wife
fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?

1345
01:53:07,834 --> 01:53:09,377
Yeah.

1346
01:53:09,503 --> 01:53:11,413
Now what's your news, Baxter?

1347
01:53:13,591 --> 01:53:17,339
It's about Miss Kubelik. She's feeling
all right again so she went home.

1348
01:53:17,469 --> 01:53:20,554
Swell. And don't think
I've forgotten what you did for me.

1349
01:53:20,681 --> 01:53:22,720
This way, Baxter.

1350
01:53:26,144 --> 01:53:28,517
Sit down. Try it on for size.

1351
01:53:29,563 --> 01:53:32,102
- You like? It's all yours.
- Mine?

1352
01:53:32,233 --> 01:53:37,440
My assistant has been shifted to the
Denver office and you're taking his place.

1353
01:53:37,571 --> 01:53:40,026
What's the matter?
You don't seem very excited.

1354
01:53:40,158 --> 01:53:44,403
Well, it's just that so many things
have been happening so fast.

1355
01:53:44,537 --> 01:53:47,323
I'm very pleased.
Especially for Miss Kubelik.

1356
01:53:47,455 --> 01:53:52,449
I think she's the kind of girl that definitely
ought to be married to... someone.

1357
01:53:52,585 --> 01:53:58,090
Sure, sure. But first the property has to be
settled. Then it takes six weeks in Reno.

1358
01:53:58,216 --> 01:54:01,132
Meanwhile I'm going to enjoy
being a bachelor for a while.

1359
01:54:01,259 --> 01:54:04,711
Oh, Baxter, you now can have lunch
in the executive dining room.

1360
01:54:04,847 --> 01:54:07,516
That's one of the privileges
that goes with this job.

1361
01:54:07,641 --> 01:54:12,267
You also get a nice little expense account,
use of the executive washroom...

1362
01:54:12,396 --> 01:54:14,802
Say, what happened to you, Baxter?

1363
01:54:14,938 --> 01:54:17,643
- I got kicked in the head too.
- Oh?

1364
01:54:38,752 --> 01:54:40,875
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.

1365
01:54:41,005 --> 01:54:42,500
Oh.

1366
01:54:42,632 --> 01:54:45,418
Miss Kubelik. How are you feeling?

1367
01:54:45,550 --> 01:54:48,256
- I feel fine. How's your eye?
- Oh, fine.

1368
01:54:48,388 --> 01:54:51,222
- How are things at the apartment?
- Nothing's changed.

1369
01:54:51,348 --> 01:54:54,303
- We never did finish that gin game.
- I know.

1370
01:54:56,019 --> 01:54:58,392
I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake.

1371
01:54:58,522 --> 01:55:01,093
Leaving his wife? Yeah.
I'm very happy for you.

1372
01:55:01,232 --> 01:55:03,807
- I never thought he'd do it.
- I told you all along.

1373
01:55:03,944 --> 01:55:07,477
- You were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
- I guess so.

1374
01:55:07,613 --> 01:55:09,652
You were wrong about me too.

1375
01:55:09,782 --> 01:55:12,949
What you said about those who take
and those who get took.

1376
01:55:13,077 --> 01:55:16,279
Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me.
I was using him. See?

1377
01:55:16,412 --> 01:55:20,910
Last month I was at desk 861 on
the 19th floor. Now I'm on the 27th floor.

1378
01:55:21,043 --> 01:55:23,081
A panelled office, three windows.

1379
01:55:23,210 --> 01:55:26,248
So it all worked out fine.
We're both getting what we wanted.

1380
01:55:26,382 --> 01:55:29,298
Yes. Will you walk me to the subway?

1381
01:55:29,424 --> 01:55:35,095
No, thank you. Well, I... To tell you the
truth, I have this heavy date for tonight.

1382
01:55:38,599 --> 01:55:41,969
- Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
- No. You know how people talk.

1383
01:55:42,104 --> 01:55:47,394
I decided it was best not to see each other
until everything was settled, divorce-wise.

1384
01:55:47,525 --> 01:55:49,565
That's very wise.

1385
01:55:50,695 --> 01:55:53,151
- Good night, Mr. Baxter.
- Good night.

1386
01:56:29,189 --> 01:56:32,557
- Baxter, could you step in here a minute?
- Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

1387
01:56:32,693 --> 01:56:34,731
- There you are.
- Much obliged.

1388
01:56:36,613 --> 01:56:42,448
Here are the figures on staff turnover. 37%
of females leave to get married and 22%...

1389
01:56:42,576 --> 01:56:45,530
Baxter, you work too hard.
It's New Year's Eve. Relax!

1390
01:56:45,663 --> 01:56:48,663
- Yes, sir.
- I suppose you'll be celebrating tonight.

1391
01:56:48,791 --> 01:56:50,915
- Naturally.
- I'm taking Miss Kubelik out.

1392
01:56:51,085 --> 01:56:53,159
- I finally talked her into it.
- I see.

1393
01:56:53,294 --> 01:56:57,672
The only thing is, I'm staying at the
Athletic Club and it's strictly stag, so...

1394
01:56:57,799 --> 01:56:59,921
If you don't mind?

1395
01:57:00,718 --> 01:57:04,252
- Don't mind what?
- You know my key to your apartment?

1396
01:57:04,388 --> 01:57:07,637
When we had that little scare
about Miss Kubelik,...

1397
01:57:07,766 --> 01:57:11,763
- ..I threw it out the window of the train.
- Very clever.

1398
01:57:11,895 --> 01:57:14,184
So now I'll have to borrow your key.

1399
01:57:15,690 --> 01:57:18,526
- Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
- What do you mean, sorry?

1400
01:57:18,652 --> 01:57:21,059
You're not bringing anybody
to my apartment.

1401
01:57:21,195 --> 01:57:25,572
- It's not just anybody. It's Miss Kubelik.
- Especially not Miss Kubelik.

1402
01:57:25,699 --> 01:57:28,902
- How's that again?
- No key.

1403
01:57:30,787 --> 01:57:35,414
Baxter, I picked you for my team because
I thought you were a bright young man.

1404
01:57:35,541 --> 01:57:38,993
Do you realise what you're doing?
Not to me, but to yourself?

1405
01:57:39,129 --> 01:57:42,498
Normally it takes years
to work your way up to the 27th floor.

1406
01:57:42,632 --> 01:57:45,669
But it only takes 30 seconds
to be out on the street again.

1407
01:57:45,802 --> 01:57:48,374
- You dig?
- I dig.

1408
01:57:49,555 --> 01:57:51,594
So what's it going to be?

1409
01:57:58,396 --> 01:58:01,480
- Now you're being bright.
- Thank you, sir.

1410
01:58:18,916 --> 01:58:21,620
- Baxter, you gave me the wrong key.
- No, I didn't.

1411
01:58:21,752 --> 01:58:24,421
But this is the key
to the executive washroom.

1412
01:58:24,546 --> 01:58:28,330
That's right. I won't be needing it
because I'm all washed up around here.

1413
01:58:28,468 --> 01:58:31,882
- What's gotten into you?
- Just following doctor's orders.

1414
01:58:32,011 --> 01:58:36,258
I've decided to become a mensch.
Know what that means? A human being.

1415
01:58:36,390 --> 01:58:40,339
- Now hold on, Baxter.
- The old payola won't work any more.

1416
01:58:40,477 --> 01:58:42,517
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

1417
01:59:12,173 --> 01:59:14,212
(Doorbell)

1418
01:59:18,137 --> 01:59:22,087
- We're having a party and ran out of ice.
- Sure, Doc.

1419
01:59:22,224 --> 01:59:24,347
How come you're alone
on New Year's Eve?

1420
01:59:24,476 --> 01:59:26,434
Well, I got things to do.

1421
01:59:26,562 --> 01:59:30,772
- What's this? You're packing?
- Yeah. I'm giving up the apartment.

1422
01:59:30,898 --> 01:59:32,774
Where are you moving to?

1423
01:59:32,902 --> 01:59:35,938
I don't know. All I know is
I gotta get outta this place.

1424
01:59:36,071 --> 01:59:38,111
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.

1425
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:42,984
Me? Oh, my body. Don't worry, it'll go to
the university, Doc. I'll put it in writing.

1426
01:59:43,119 --> 01:59:46,320
- Could you use some champagne?
- Booze we don't need.

1427
01:59:46,455 --> 01:59:48,282
Say, why don't you join us?

1428
01:59:48,415 --> 01:59:53,409
We got two brain surgeons, a proctologist
and three nurses from Bellevue.

1429
01:59:53,544 --> 01:59:55,502
No, thanks. I don't feel like it.

1430
01:59:55,630 --> 01:59:59,877
In case I don't see you again, how much
do I owe you for taking care of that girl?

1431
02:00:00,009 --> 02:00:03,877
Forget it. I didn't do it as a doctor.
I did it as a neighbour.

1432
02:00:04,013 --> 02:00:06,682
By the way, whatever happened to her?

1433
02:00:07,974 --> 02:00:10,976
You know me with girls.
Easy come, easy go.

1434
02:00:11,103 --> 02:00:13,772
- Goodbye, Doc.
- Happy New Year.

1435
02:00:44,008 --> 02:00:45,335
(Lively music and chatter)

1436
02:00:57,104 --> 02:00:59,559
Sorry I took so long
on the phone. We're all set.

1437
02:00:59,689 --> 02:01:02,097
- For what?
- I rented a car. It'll be here at one.

1438
02:01:02,233 --> 02:01:05,104
- We're driving to Atlantic City.
- Atlantic City?

1439
02:01:05,236 --> 02:01:09,779
I know it's a drag, but you can't find
a hotel room in town on New Year's Eve.

1440
02:01:10,824 --> 02:01:13,696
Ring out the old year, ring in the new.

1441
02:01:13,828 --> 02:01:16,033
Ring-a-ding-ding.

1442
02:01:16,538 --> 02:01:19,909
I didn't plan it this way. It's Baxter's fault.

1443
02:01:20,043 --> 02:01:21,038
Baxter?

1444
02:01:21,168 --> 02:01:24,702
He wouldn't give me
the key to the apartment.

1445
02:01:24,838 --> 02:01:27,411
- He wouldn't?
- No. He just walked out on me. Quit.

1446
02:01:27,549 --> 02:01:30,585
Threw that big, fat job right in my face.

1447
02:01:32,010 --> 02:01:36,092
- The nerve.
- The little punk. After all I did for him.

1448
02:01:36,224 --> 02:01:40,600
Said I couldn't bring anybody to the
apartment, especially not Miss Kubelik.

1449
02:01:40,727 --> 02:01:43,515
What's he got against you, anyway?

1450
02:01:43,648 --> 02:01:49,519
I don't know. I guess that's the way
it crumbles, cookie-wise.

1451
02:01:51,571 --> 02:01:54,025
What are you talking about?

1452
02:01:55,031 --> 02:01:58,448
I'd spell it out for you, only I can't spell.

1453
02:02:03,457 --> 02:02:08,533
(All) # Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1454
02:02:08,670 --> 02:02:13,582
# And never brought to mind...

1455
02:02:14,925 --> 02:02:16,966
Happy New Year, Fran.

1456
02:02:19,055 --> 02:02:23,432
# And days of auld lang syne

1457
02:02:24,310 --> 02:02:29,470
# For auld lang syne, my dear

1458
02:02:29,607 --> 02:02:34,647
# For auld lang syne

1459
02:02:34,777 --> 02:02:39,938
# We'll drink a cup of kindness yet

1460
02:02:40,158 --> 02:02:45,745
# For auld lang syne

1461
02:02:46,204 --> 02:02:48,244
(Cheering)

1462
02:02:51,377 --> 02:02:53,416
(Horns and whistles)

1463
02:02:57,508 --> 02:02:59,546
Fran?

1464
02:03:00,844 --> 02:03:02,883
Where are you, Fran?

1465
02:03:18,651 --> 02:03:20,893
(Bang)

1466
02:03:21,030 --> 02:03:23,069
Mr. Baxter!

1467
02:03:23,364 --> 02:03:24,526
Mr. Baxter!

1468
02:03:24,906 --> 02:03:27,908
Mr. Baxter! Mr. Baxter!

1469
02:03:30,913 --> 02:03:32,242
Oh!

1470
02:03:32,373 --> 02:03:35,492
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1471
02:03:35,625 --> 02:03:38,081
Are you sure? How's your knee?

1472
02:03:38,836 --> 02:03:40,876
I'm fine all over.

1473
02:03:42,924 --> 02:03:46,339
- Mind if I come in?
- Of course not.

1474
02:03:50,099 --> 02:03:52,137
Let me get another glass.

1475
02:03:55,102 --> 02:03:57,224
- Where are you going?
- Who knows?

1476
02:03:57,353 --> 02:04:00,688
Another neighborhood,
another town, another job.

1477
02:04:00,816 --> 02:04:03,141
I'm on my own.

1478
02:04:03,276 --> 02:04:05,316
That's funny. So am I.

1479
02:04:06,530 --> 02:04:08,817
What'd you do with the cards?

1480
02:04:08,948 --> 02:04:10,987
In there.

1481
02:04:22,336 --> 02:04:24,375
What about Mr. Sheldrake?

1482
02:04:24,504 --> 02:04:27,590
I'm gonna send him
a fruitcake every Christmas.

1483
02:04:30,050 --> 02:04:32,091
Cut.

1484
02:04:33,762 --> 02:04:35,802
I love you, Miss Kubelik.

1485
02:04:36,350 --> 02:04:38,176
Three.

1486
02:04:38,309 --> 02:04:39,507
Queen.

1487
02:04:39,643 --> 02:04:43,642
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik?
I absolutely adore you.

1488
02:04:46,316 --> 02:04:48,356
Shut up and deal.
