1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,949  X1:038 X2:682 Y1:448 Y2:510
THIS CHURCH WAS AT ONE TIME THE OBJECT
OF MUCH ABUSE HAVING BEEN BUILT BY

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,955  X1:037 X2:680 Y1:448 Y2:510
A COXCOMB CHEEKY ENOUGH TO ALTER
THE GROUND PLAN CONTRARY TO THE RULE.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,955  X1:050 X2:670 Y1:448 Y2:515
WE WERE ACQUAINTED WITH THAT MASTER
BUILDER AND WE LIKED HIM WELL,

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,955  X1:054 X2:664 Y1:484 Y2:510
EVEN IF HE WAS SOME WHAT DISSOLUTE.

5
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,309  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:484 Y2:510
THE CAPRICIOUS SUMMER

6
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,316  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:484 Y2:510
This is an unfortunate summer indeed.

7
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,155  X1:111 X2:608 Y1:448 Y2:516
Shouldn't the month of June at least
permit us to attend

8
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,152  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:484 Y2:510
to our health and cleanness?

9
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,919  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:510
Hey, mister!
Get down from the broomstick

10
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,639  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:484 Y2:516
I see you are riding.

11
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,918  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:516
Where did you learn such manners?
- Pray do not call me indecent.

12
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,749  X1:107 X2:612 Y1:448 Y2:510
I removed my trousers
because the skin too wants to breathe.

13
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,110  X1:196 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:516
I was taught and I follow
the rules of hygiene.

14
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,113  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:516
For the benefit of my body.

15
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,711  X1:128 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:516
Being enthusiastic for the present.

16
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,313  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:516
You are neglecting things eternal.

17
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,915  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:516
The book I laid down
is near enough to be remindful

18
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,955  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:516
of what duration means.
It is 2000 years old!

19
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,159  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:484 Y2:516
Pay attention to my words, major.

20
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,752  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:510
The major has not read your book
and will never read it.

21
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,751  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:484 Y2:510
Even if it were older still.

22
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,395  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:510
Should he believe the bray
of old asses sounded better?

23
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,677  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:516
He has come to fish
and you scare the fish away.

24
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,319  X1:313 X2:404 Y1:484 Y2:510
Oh no.

25
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,960  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:484 Y2:510
I have come to like these discussions.

26
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,434  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:448 Y2:510
Although I do not find them very noble,
I admit them.

27
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,509  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:516
As a faint reflex of passion.

28
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,960  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:516
What can be more magnificent
than an ever blue sky

29
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,555  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:484 Y2:516
and an ever burning red passion?

30
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,712  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:484 Y2:516
I am doubtful about the blue sky.

31
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,195  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:484 Y2:516
This June is not up to the mark.

32
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,357  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:516
Why are you holding back?
As if do not moan hours long?

33
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,190  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:516
Being poor I cannot afford
to express my indignation.

34
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,756  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:484 Y2:515
Yet, I feel inclined to curse.

35
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,949  X1:129 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:516
But for your propensity to wrangle
I could be of some help

36
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,437  X1:168 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:516
but you always want to have
the last say.

37
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,951  X1:184 X2:536 Y1:448 Y2:510
Better to have the last say
than the last blow...

38
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,958  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:516
Oh, you are never idle!

39
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,434  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:448 Y2:510
We are discoursing on abstract things
with the canon.

40
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,435  X1:143 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:516
I thing you are talking nonsense

41
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,752  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:484 Y2:516
and shouting as if money was at stake.

42
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,870  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:516
I have had to listen
to my husband's prating

43
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,714  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:484 Y2:510
ever since I married him at seventeen.

44
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,916  X1:119 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:516
For you should know
I was too young when I got married.

45
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,235  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:484 Y2:510
I could have chosen better fellows

46
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,756  X1:100 X2:619 Y1:447 Y2:516
if Antonín had not thrashed my suitors
got hold of my keys

47
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,072  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:516
and plagued me
until marriage became unavoidable.

48
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,755  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:510
How can I, major, under such
circumstances

49
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,751  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:448 Y2:516
heed your kings
the canon's books and my own health?

50
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,037  X1:093 X2:627 Y1:447 Y2:510
It's true, Antonín was very much in love
and of excellent health.

51
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,275  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:516
I bet he gave the fellows
a good hiding.

52
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,273  X1:125 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:516
My husband is an unparalleled ass
come sir, let me ferry you.

53
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,038  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:514
Those two won't hear a word...

54
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,789  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:516
I am ready to bet
they are talking about fire-arms.

55
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,837  X1:136 X2:584 Y1:447 Y2:516
You never met the organist, abbé
who used to pinch my hip...

56
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,195  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:484 Y2:516
singing merrily at the same time.

57
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,951  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:448 Y2:515
I am sure you are not lagging behind
him - in inventiveness,

58
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,669  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:448 Y2:516
being much travelled
and highly educated.

59
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,876  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:516
The swimming master, you and I
are old enough not to be tempted

60
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,149  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:484 Y2:516
to jump over a neighbour's fence.

61
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,954  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:448 Y2:510
The canon is a pervert
beware of him.

62
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,518  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:484 Y2:516
Oh, this has nothing to do with me.

63
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,359  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:484 Y2:516
You are uncanny, major.

64
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,951  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:516
Always astraddle, perspiring
casting lightening-glances

65
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,760  X1:147 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:516
you remind me of a sergeant
I used to know rather intimately

66
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,713  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:448 Y2:510
when I was young.
Lend me a hand!

67
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,348  X1:072 X2:645 Y1:484 Y2:516
That sergeant was as quarrelsome as you.

68
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,593  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:510
I offered him everything suitable
to curb his vehemence.

69
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,354  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:516
Still, he twisted buttons
in his impatient fingers...

70
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,431  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:510
and drank bottle after bottle.

71
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,632  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:516
He was in the army-service corps
wearing red breaches, not like you

72
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,155  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:484 Y2:516
an old artilleryman.

73
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,909  X1:137 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:510
Regiments wearing red breaches
were recruited form farm hands.

74
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,079  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:516
Oh, indeed?
I have never heard such opinion.

75
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,676  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:516
Those fellows,
were the darlings of our street.

76
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,515  X1:086 X2:633 Y1:448 Y2:516
Your husband to whom you are indebted
for having taken you out

77
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,955  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:516
of a hideous suburb
was neither a wagoner nor a gunner

78
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,719  X1:271 X2:448 Y1:484 Y2:516
but a sapper.

79
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,155  X1:254 X2:464 Y1:484 Y2:514
Don't I know it!

80
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,712  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:516
Hint at anything else
and the master will baste you.

81
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,356  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:516
Only fools neglect the present
living in the past.

82
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,356  X1:221 X2:498 Y1:484 Y2:510
Let us eat and drink!

83
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,556  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:516
Give me fat cheese, venison
birds, lambs, all that is brought

84
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,355  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:484 Y2:516
forth alive or hatched from eggs.

85
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,954  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:484 Y2:516
Give me fish and the slugs

86
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,753  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:484 Y2:510
favoured in civilized countries.

87
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,513  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:516
Give me food
the Earth has revolved again

88
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,915  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:484 Y2:510
and it is time to eat.

89
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,555  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:516
Have you become a windbag
or a glutton, major?

90
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,918  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:448 Y2:516
Showing off with you teeth
or your tongue?

91
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,075  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:484 Y2:516
Too much talk makes me uneasy.

92
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,271  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:516
Uneasy?
We have hardly begun!

93
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,393  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:516
You follow a bad regimen
with too much thinking.

94
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,990  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:516
Even while eating
which is another form of gluttony.

95
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,358  X1:108 X2:612 Y1:484 Y2:516
Do you want to start another quarrel?

96
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,596  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:516
Only because of your bad habits.

97
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,793  X1:148 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:516
If I stuck up to my ears in water
you would pull me out.

98
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,516  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:448 Y2:510
Are you not drowning in errors
more fatal than water?

99
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,359  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:484 Y2:516
Where is the vinegar?

100
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,550  X1:291 X2:427 Y1:484 Y2:510
And salt...

101
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,233  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:510
Remember how we used to put
salt on our toast?

102
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,630  X1:324 X2:394 Y1:484 Y2:510
Alas!

103
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,955  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:484 Y2:516
I remember the Italian campaign.

104
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,072  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:484 Y2:516
Why was the first Piave battle lost?

105
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,232  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:510
The army was short of mugs.
So that we drank wine from hands.

106
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,037  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:516
The soldiers had to punch the casks
with their bayonets

107
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,029  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:510
and several regiments
were drowned in wine in cellars.

108
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,036  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:510
Much wine was wasted that way
wine which would otherwise have

109
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,030  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:484 Y2:516
stimulated their waning courage.

110
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,351  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:516
Show your courage, major
by lifting a quintal.

111
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,476  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:516
I could recite some verses
which are immortal though dealing

112
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,558  X1:186 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:516
neither with slaughter nor
weight-lifting.

113
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,433  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:516
Do not repeat bookish twaddle!

114
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,114  X1:119 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:516
Silence!
I shall answer you with this weapon.

115
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,434  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:483 Y2:510
The abbé will die from fear!

116
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,237  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:448 Y2:516
All right, I have means
to take you down a peg.

117
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,913  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:484 Y2:516
Valour burnt high

118
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,638  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:484 Y2:516
Though the arms grew weaker...

119
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,915  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:516
To blazes with your book of odes!

120
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,839  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:516
And by sword and spear
Men died on the ramparts...

121
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,475  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:448 Y2:516
The finger gnawing at
an unintelligible line...

122
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,870  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:484 Y2:515
Still, those who died were the victors.

123
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,871  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:510
Go hang, you interpreter
of short-winded lines

124
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,951  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:516
limping according to rules!

125
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,072  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:484 Y2:516
Their life alone took the cunning foe

126
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,518  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:516
And they were crowned with eternal
glory.

127
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,560  X1:219 X2:500 Y1:484 Y2:516
Enter unhesitatingly!

128
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,752  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:447 Y2:510
The abbé and the major
found the water warmish.

129
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,872  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:510
Should you be short of anything
shout and I shall be in time...

130
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,553  X1:192 X2:528 Y1:448 Y2:516
My husband may be silly
but he knows his rights

131
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,153  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:484 Y2:516
and how to protect them.

132
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,074  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:516
If he did not, he would be more
than simply... Antonín.

133
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,755  X1:098 X2:621 Y1:483 Y2:515
Yes, Antonín - because I am Katherine.

134
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,037  X1:155 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:516
You have acquired some logic
which is disarming.

135
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,916  X1:146 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:510
I am going to leave
because some of these females

136
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,390  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:448 Y2:516
always try to drown
in sight of us.

137
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,916  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:516
Be smart in case of need
and cautious if they are not of age.

138
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,592  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:516
Being a stalwart man of fifty
you are welcome here, major.

139
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,354  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:516
Do you want these women
to go away and leave

140
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,792  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:484 Y2:516
my swimming-bath unfrequented?

141
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,036  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:484 Y2:510
This would ruin me!

142
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,036  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:510
You seem to be too sure
of our tolerance.

143
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,276  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:484 Y2:516
All commanders are naturally tolerant!

144
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,553  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:516
I am Ernie, the conjurer
and, being sensitive to cold...

145
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,435  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:516
The clear sky spells a hot day.
Undress, gentlemen!

146
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,909  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:516
Is it you, sir
who are in everybody's mouth?

147
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,472  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:510
The fire-eater said to have lived
in Paris

148
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,118  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:484 Y2:510
who has arrived from Holland?

149
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,113  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:484 Y2:516
I was everywhere.

150
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,117  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:484 Y2:516
Like all magicians!

151
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,673  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:484 Y2:516
Chaps munching glass.

152
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,750  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:484 Y2:516
Producing wigs from their sleeves.

153
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,752  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:516
Self confident in spite of
a misshapen chest.

154
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,360  X1:131 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:510
He seems dressed for some other
occasion.

155
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,519  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:484 Y2:516
Too extravagant...

156
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,236  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:516
He is showing all his limbs

157
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,956  X1:243 X2:476 Y1:484 Y2:516
in his pink tights.

158
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,470  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:516
Pink is the colour of piglings.

159
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,113  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:516
If pink is the colour of pigs
the scientists grey

160
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,356  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:510
is the colour of rats.

161
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,673  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:484 Y2:516
This is a capricious summer.

162
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,436  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:516
It was raining yesterday
and it may be raining today.

163
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,640  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:484 Y2:516
Is Dutch weather equally bad?

164
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,433  X1:269 X2:450 Y1:484 Y2:510
A little better.

165
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,190  X1:136 X2:584 Y1:484 Y2:516
But the Sundays are mainly wet.

166
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,758  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:516
I am practised in clever feats
which, though physical

167
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,355  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:484 Y2:510
are mental as well.

168
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,752  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:516
I make things vanish from sight
imperceptibly, by a sleight of hand

169
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,474  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:516
the outcome of much thinkings
and long deliberation.

170
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,389  X1:164 X2:556 Y1:484 Y2:516
Will you tell me the time, sir?

171
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,600  X1:074 X2:645 Y1:448 Y2:516
I feel something like a chill
between the two hemispheres of my brain.

172
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,359  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:484 Y2:516
I hear a ringing as of Easter-bells

173
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,189  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:516
and it is the ticking of a watch
within my skull.

174
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,073  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:484 Y2:516
This watch was inside your head?

175
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,709  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:484 Y2:510
Your artistic skill must be rewarded.

176
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,957  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:510
Oh, I never expected to find
so much discernment

177
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,752  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:516
in an out-of-the way country.

178
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,277  X1:119 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:516
My public usually shows
less appreciation, showering on me

179
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,875  X1:235 X2:483 Y1:484 Y2:516
uneatable objects.

180
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,918  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:484 Y2:516
People are so rude!

181
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,038  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:484 Y2:516
But give me my watches back!

182
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,994  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:484 Y2:515
I ask no more than to be rude, too.

183
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,392  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:448 Y2:510
Time flies and I cannot
hold it back.

184
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,075  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:448 Y2:516
Allow me to invite you
to my performance.

185
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,319  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:516
Mysteries! Amusement!

186
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,913  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:516
A heartrending spectacle!

187
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,072  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:510
Reduced entrance-fee
for children and soldiers!

188
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,711  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:484 Y2:510
Mr. Ernie is a smart fellow.

189
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,150  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:448 Y2:516
Did you see him blush
when the major made

190
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,950  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:484 Y2:516
that churlish gesture?

191
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,592  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:484 Y2:515
A smart fellow, indeed.

192
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,956  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:516
He ate and drank his fill
without paying the entrance-fee.

193
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,318  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:516
If that devil of yours were near
he would use his pitchfork on us

194
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,436  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:516
A because we fancy women
and are hurrying

195
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,068  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:516
to a magical pastime.

196
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,156  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:483 Y2:515
You are mistaken, Antonín.

197
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,357  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:516
I own no devil
and the devil has no pitchfork.

198
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,032  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:516
Pretty girls are deucedly scarce
but they do exist.

199
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:41,509  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:516
Each of them has her instrument
and all of them are present.

200
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,710  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:510
That rascally Ernie has roused
the town

201
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,279  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:516
with his tricks and his bragging.

202
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,672  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:516
What else has brought
so many people here?

203
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,189  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:484 Y2:510
I am not used to emotion...

204
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,753  X1:191 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:516
Isn't she pretty, though?

205
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,833  X1:174 X2:546 Y1:484 Y2:516
Hasn't she got everything?

206
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,872  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:447 Y2:516
Antonín, let us ask her
to remove that... array!

207
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,713  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:484 Y2:510
These are fruitless trees.

208
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,710  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:484 Y2:510
But nature can be corrected.

209
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,556  X1:132 X2:588 Y1:484 Y2:516
Are you ready to pay, gentlemen?

210
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,077  X1:188 X2:532 Y1:448 Y2:516
Whispering is a bad habit
objected to by moralists.

211
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,754  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:516
Ever since it was condemned
by the catechism, people abstain

212
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,951  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:448 Y2:516
from it
except in churches.

213
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,636  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:516
Enough!
The lady is in a hurry...

214
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,358  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:447 Y2:516
I wager, dear abbé, I can do it
as expertly without any preparation.

215
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,598  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:484 Y2:516
Do not overdo things, sir!

216
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,117  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:516
I bet he is not following his nose.

217
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,710  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:516
It always shows a deviation
to the right or left.

218
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,276  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:484 Y2:516
You are talking rubbish.

219
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,916  X1:091 X2:629 Y1:484 Y2:516
Did those somersaults seem imperfect?

220
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,189  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:448 Y2:516
If you seek perfection in somersaults...
I've got nothing to say

221
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,276  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:448 Y2:510
This is a dark night
and a lot of rascals

222
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,349  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:510
want to steal your bath towels
and other articles.

223
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,239  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:516
Go to sleep, dear Katherine
I shall be keeping watch.

224
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,798  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:448 Y2:516
The couch in the cloakroom
will serve for a vigilant rest.

225
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,037  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'll sleep with one eye open.

226
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,796  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:484 Y2:516
Open the door, you depraved lecher!

227
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,351  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:448 Y2:516
This accursed vocation
has earned me nothing

228
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,039  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:484 Y2:516
but insults and injury.

229
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,597  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:516
I could have chosen
from a tidy bunch of young men

230
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,789  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:516
and look what I picked out:

231
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,075  X1:172 X2:548 Y1:448 Y2:516
A blockhead and a wencher
chasing after quills

232
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,071  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:484 Y2:510
with his home full of feathers!

233
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,234  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:484 Y2:516
You are drinking, gentlemen?

234
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,433  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:484 Y2:516
Is it you, major?

235
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,357  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:484 Y2:516
And you, reverend?

236
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,358  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:484 Y2:516
Hurry up, now!

237
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,711  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:516
Get this poor girl
some warm milk and dry underwear!

238
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,071  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:516
I am afraid she has got drowned.

239
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,471  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:484 Y2:516
I dived for the poor child

240
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,237  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:510
a girl hardly 20 years old
or she would have drowned.

241
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,115  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:516
I hear it was Anna, the girl
form the conjurer's caravan.

242
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,591  X1:179 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:516
How come you've drag her
through willow trees here.

243
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,475  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:516
And that she had
to jump into the river

244
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,394  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:484 Y2:510
to save herself from a shameless rake.

245
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,870  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:484 Y2:516
It is nice to have a jilly girl friend.

246
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,037  X1:298 X2:420 Y1:484 Y2:510
I know it.

247
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,234  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:484 Y2:516
The pink little ears, the red lips...

248
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,153  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:516
I say, I know it
but the time's passing by.

249
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,952  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:484 Y2:516
All that is too easily forgotten.

250
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,676  X1:140 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:516
Being stupid, women have never
accomplished anything great

251
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,630  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:484 Y2:516
and are ignorant of spiritual delights.

252
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,595  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:516
Besides causing degeneration
by interbreeding with the offspring

253
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,315  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:516
of noblemen, and begetting
readers of deposit books.

254
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,837  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:484 Y2:516
Tonight I found a girl in his bed.

255
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,512  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:484 Y2:514
Wasn't she wet?

256
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,633  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:516
I heard the clink of glass
the purl of water, but alas!

257
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,509  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:448 Y2:510
Oh, gosh, father
now it's clear to me.

258
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,310  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:510
They deceived me by drenching
her underwear!

259
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,319  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:483 Y2:510
Look at Antonín!

260
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,232  X1:236 X2:484 Y1:448 Y2:516
Could such an oaf
win a pretty girl?

261
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,749  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:484 Y2:516
Are you sure it was Anna?

262
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,512  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:516
Canon Roch is right.

263
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,513  X1:123 X2:596 Y1:484 Y2:516
It was some hag carrying firewood.

264
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,354  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:448 Y2:516
Though lascivious once
your husband is old now.

265
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,319  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:484 Y2:510
I know best how old he is.

266
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,153  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:448 Y2:510
This wench did not come from the woods
she came from the caravan.

267
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,917  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:484 Y2:515
Yes, Canon, it was Anna!

268
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,558  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:516
No inactivity here!

269
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,791  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:484 Y2:516
No inactivity at all!

270
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,999  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:448 Y2:516
This bird reminds me
of your own chickens.

271
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,671  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:516
These are the lamentable confusions
of the ripe age.

272
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,909  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:516
Love arising from the transition
of periods.

273
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,949  X1:121 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:516
I can see my obese
but respectable wife killing chicken

274
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,952  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:514
to carry them blushing
to Ernie's caravan.

275
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,433  X1:194 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:516
I am ready to forgive her

276
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,949  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:516
but I want to be sure
her new passion is a lasting one.

277
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,749  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:448 Y2:514
Begone lovers, depart
and for heaven's sake

278
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,711  X1:249 X2:470 Y1:484 Y2:510
let it be for ever!

279
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,395  X1:109 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:516
How nice is to count days up to three

280
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,074  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:510
How beautiful to wander
from town to town!

281
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,590  X1:125 X2:595 Y1:484 Y2:516
How beautiful to conjure up flames

282
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,915  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:484 Y2:516
to handle nice round objects!

283
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,831  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:516
How beautiful... the lamps!

284
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,633  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:448 Y2:516
The magic hat!
And a steep rope.

285
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,875  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:515
Oh, it's so wonderful!

286
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,437  X1:119 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:516
Why are we having such fine nights
and such inclement days?

287
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,675  X1:146 X2:574 Y1:484 Y2:516
Because you are a great sinner.

288
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,516  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:516
Consider it a punishment.

289
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,189  X1:171 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:516
Rubbish!
We used to be sinning more

290
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,113  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:516
and yet the sun was shining...
I don't think this is the point.

291
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,309  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:510
The mutual attraction of sexes
is older than rocks

292
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,800  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:516
and I can't see a deluge coming!

293
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,269  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:516
Do you never feel the urge
to concur with that creative power

294
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,351  X1:109 X2:610 Y1:484 Y2:516
in defiance of your Carthusian rules?

295
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:51,596  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:447 Y2:516
Dear Mr. Antonín, thank you
for coming to my aid.

296
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,471  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:484 Y2:510
You are so delicate.

297
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,436  X1:192 X2:528 Y1:484 Y2:516
Didn't you catch a cold?

298
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,349  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:515
I had a cup of tea
and Mrs. Dùrová, your wife

299
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,431  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:484 Y2:516
took good care of me.

300
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,154  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:516
My wife indulges in idle talk.

301
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,189  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:516
Let her stay in a Ernie's Ark
and don't ever go back to him.

302
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,669  X1:131 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:516
Ernie may be a mediocre conjurer
but he is a good foster-father.

303
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,156  X1:235 X2:484 Y1:484 Y2:516
Look at his magic!

304
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,951  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:516
Katherine playing the barrel-organ
Anna collecting the money

305
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,231  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:516
both of them living with him.

306
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,353  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:484 Y2:516
This sorcerer has the devil's help!

307
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,518  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:484 Y2:516
I've often been afraid you are not sane.

308
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,154  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:516
I see I was justified
in my fear for your sanity.

309
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,038  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:516
Treating it as a joke
after your wife has left you!

310
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,110  X1:077 X2:643 Y1:484 Y2:516
I wonder how Ernie is going to make beds

311
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,631  X1:248 X2:468 Y1:484 Y2:510
with two women

312
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,709  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:484 Y2:516
and a single bedroom.

313
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,949  X1:132 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:510
I should have given you this book
the first time we met.

314
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,555  X1:325 X2:395 Y1:484 Y2:510
Yes?

315
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,792  X1:178 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:510
Yes, dear Anna, it contains
chaste love stories

316
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,158  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:484 Y2:516
suitable for your ears.

317
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,399  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:516
Excuse me, I am frying fish
the supper might get burned.

318
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,355  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:516
Why, the fish are not fresh anyway
and today is not Friday.

319
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:20,715  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:516
All right, I shall let you hold
the saucepan over the fire.

320
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,594  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:516
Ernie is a moulting ape.

321
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,471  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:484 Y2:514
And he's knock-kneed too!

322
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,308  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:516
But he knows the ropes.

323
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,638  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:484 Y2:516
Isn't this lass all right!

324
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,199  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:484 Y2:510
For the bed!

325
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,591  X1:296 X2:421 Y1:484 Y2:515
OK, now!

326
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,756  X1:186 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:516
In the name of the law!
What are you doing here?

327
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,392  X1:241 X2:478 Y1:484 Y2:510
I went to see him.

328
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,315  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:484 Y2:510
His ear torn and his face all swollen.

329
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,911  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:516
He was reading two books
and seemed in good mood.

330
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:04,277  X1:162 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:516
He ought to show repentance
and castigate himself...

331
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,356  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:516
as they did in good monasteries

332
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,319  X1:243 X2:476 Y1:484 Y2:514
Isn't he a monk?

333
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,839  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:516
No.
Antonin, you should not give him

334
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,712  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:484 Y2:510
such bad advice.

335
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,038  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:484 Y2:516
He got his desert.

336
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,995  X1:163 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:516
With his ear nearly torn away
needing a few stitches...

337
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,079  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:516
Get ready with your needle!

338
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,754  X1:109 X2:612 Y1:484 Y2:516
A physician might spread the rumour

339
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,230  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:510
that your ear was not damaged
in defence of the Church.

340
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,677  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:448 Y2:516
And cos' it is better to keep
our mouth shut about the whole thing

341
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,716  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:516
Let Mr. Dùra doctor you.

342
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:10,189  X1:162 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:516
He is very skilled with needle
as you know.

343
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,636  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:516
Antonín Dùra is a gifted man.

344
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,838  X1:155 X2:565 Y1:484 Y2:516
Will you have a glass of wine?

345
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,358  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:484 Y2:516
I shall need some spirit.

346
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:26,149  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:448 Y2:516
Or some hot water
for my long neglected tools.

347
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,109  X1:153 X2:567 Y1:448 Y2:516
You know I try to avoid trouble
and my nearly severed ear

348
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,830  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:484 Y2:516
cannot make me change my attitude.

349
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:51,549  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:510
I returned to Ernie's caravan
and entered into conversation

350
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:56,071  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:484 Y2:516
with Anna who was frying fish.

351
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,958  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:484 Y2:516
Did you have supper with her?

352
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:05,109  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:516
I had a morsel of the fish
you caught in the river...

353
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:11,229  X1:094 X2:625 Y1:448 Y2:510
Keep your shameless story to yourself!
I don't want to hear it! I know it!

354
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,514  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:483 Y2:515
Be cheerful, abbé, cheerful!

355
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,837  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:516
Present you ear with heroic
determination and stop swearing

356
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,399  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:516
I might get confused!

357
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,948  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:516
Oh, you lecherous poets!

358
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,150  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:484 Y2:516
Oh, you confounded literature!

359
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,749  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:510
When will artistic writing
turn its back on brothels?

360
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:46,269  X1:133 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:510
And embrace noble civic virtues?

361
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:52,829  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:516
When shall we be reading
about sale and purchase

362
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:01,509  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:516
about patrician
cattle breeding and a amelioration?

363
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,831  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:448 Y2:516
Or a book of poems
about bodily strength

364
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:17,709  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:484 Y2:516
and agitation for a just class-rule?

365
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,319  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:510
When will it be?

366
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,399  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:484 Y2:510
In some distant time?

367
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:30,149  X1:095 X2:623 Y1:447 Y2:516
I heard you, abbé
droning verses of no educational value

368
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,395  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:516
frothing with the violent blood
and cruelty of specialists

369
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,555  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:516
who at the very cost of starvation
always try to introduce

370
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:45,519  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:484 Y2:516
a new, unintelligible beauty.

371
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,916  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:516
The major and I say
it is a nonsensical and vulgar one.

372
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:06,920  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:516
And your manners have become
so dissolute that you get into brawls!

373
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,670  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:448 Y2:516
Yes, I got hurt and you
sewed up the wound.

374
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,119  X1:247 X2:470 Y1:448 Y2:510
It is also true
that I used to sit

375
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,758  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:516
on the river bank, reading books.

376
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,799  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:510
Books by Shakespeare
Rabelais and Cervantes.

377
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,870  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:516
I would lay down my head for them
as I nearly laid down

378
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,433  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:484 Y2:516
my ear for Anna.

379
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,955  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:516
The battlefield is the only place
to die nobly.

380
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,199  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:484 Y2:516
Poets make bad soldiers, anyhow.

381
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,439  X1:245 X2:473 Y1:482 Y2:516
Mr. Dùra is right.

382
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,838  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:484 Y2:516
What I say is:

383
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:53,629  X1:084 X2:634 Y1:448 Y2:516
Distance can be measured by wandering
just as affluence by hunger

384
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,317  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:516
and play precedes action...

385
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,159  X1:137 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:516
Or, are you not convinced, major
that everything has its origin

386
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:08,189  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:516
in the playfulness and courage
of people who have time to spare

387
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,238  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:448 Y2:516
to babble like Gods
marshaling things

388
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,958  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:484 Y2:516
into an amazing sequence?

389
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,559  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:447 Y2:516
I observe, Antonín,
your character is changing

390
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,996  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:448 Y2:516
you have just spoken
in favour of poetry!

391
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,719  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:484 Y2:515
No, no, forsooth!

392
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,195  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:516
I never thought of doing it.

393
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:44,549  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:516
Dear madam, near Mülhausen
we got into a snowstorm.

394
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,710  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:510
The funnel not drawing
it was cold in the caravan...

395
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,832  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:484 Y2:510
You know what foul weather means.

396
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,351  X1:156 X2:564 Y1:484 Y2:516
But was your caravan clean?

397
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:00,910  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:448 Y2:516
Only a well kept home
is pleasant to live in.

398
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,593  X1:144 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:515
I intend to make some coverlets
and cushions, Ernie

399
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,159  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:484 Y2:510
to embellish it.

400
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,673  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:516
Don't forgot the rug.

401
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,673  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:448 Y2:516
Anna burnt a hole in it
with a cigarette.

402
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,476  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:516
I reproved her yesterday.

403
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,711  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:484 Y2:516
She is damaging wilfully our property.

404
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,749  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:516
If she does not mend her ways
I shall give her an hour's notice.

405
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:36,670  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:510
Ernie will not leave his caravan
in this weather...

406
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:43,389  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:516
I see you want to stay at home
and that you have hardened you heart.

407
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:49,191  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:448 Y2:516
Is it the very first time
you got the mitten?

408
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,673  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:484 Y2:516
Leave sour thoughts alone.

409
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,470  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:516
Get reconciled with the Canon
who is only an instrument

410
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,039  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:484 Y2:516
of providence.

411
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,035  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:510
Have you forgotten how we used
to hunt on the river bank

412
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:06,509  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:484 Y2:510
for earth worms who love moisture?

413
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,314  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:484 Y2:516
The pleasant conversation

414
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,270  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:516
the delightful squabbles we had
which always ended well...

415
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,512  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:483 Y2:516
Antonín, all that is coming back!

416
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,678  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:510
I have said many times
Anna does not fit into such

417
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,239  X1:263 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:516
surroundings.

418
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,878  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:484 Y2:516
Look how puzzled she looks!

419
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,111  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:516
Her plate nearly empty!

420
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,349  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:516
You should marry her, major
I think she is being ill-treated

421
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,873  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:482 Y2:516
by Mrs. Dùrová.

422
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,709  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:484 Y2:515
Miss Anna, leave the caravan.

423
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,996  X1:277 X2:441 Y1:484 Y2:510
Come to us!

424
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,032  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:514
Take my swimming bath
take the Canon's books.

425
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,792  X1:207 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:516
What about the major?

426
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,759  X1:209 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:516
I shall kill the conjurer
and got to jail.

427
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,999  X1:289 X2:428 Y1:484 Y2:510
Get down!

428
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:51,149  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:516
Come down, mister!
And do not tempt providence

429
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,438  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:516
You're going to hurt yourself!
And you'll get nothing for that

430
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,840  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:484 Y2:516
Stop that nonsense, come down!

431
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,153  X1:251 X2:468 Y1:484 Y2:516
What did I say?!

432
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,199  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:516
The conjurer is dead!

433
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,510  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:448 Y2:516
He's simulating!
- The bump he got!

434
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,239  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:516
Serves him right.
Why did he climb up there!

435
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:47,349  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:516
Let's collect a few crowns
and buy him a hen for his soup.

436
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:51,635  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:514
Don't forget, dear neighbour
we don't hold with collections.

437
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,513  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:516
Think what you could buy!

438
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,239  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:484 Y2:516
And have a good time...

439
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,239  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:484 Y2:516
He is a poor fellow.

440
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:06,316  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:516
He deserves spanking
so that the town is peaceful again!

441
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,473  X1:235 X2:483 Y1:484 Y2:516
You cry too much!

442
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,994  X1:089 X2:630 Y1:448 Y2:516
My companion hates murderous tumbles
as much as blubbering.

443
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:18,037  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:516
Now put on Ernie's tights
for another performance.

444
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,951  X1:230 X2:488 Y1:484 Y2:516
A crowd is waiting!

445
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,871  X1:134 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:516
Am I, a respectable citizen's wife
to take part publicly

446
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,909  X1:162 X2:558 Y1:484 Y2:516
in deception and subterfuge?

447
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:37,269  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:516
I am used to a decent house
and I shall have it again

448
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,669  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:483 Y2:516
because Antonín is calling me back.

449
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,479  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:448 Y2:516
I saw him several times
near the caravan, pole

450
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:49,509  X1:175 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:516
perturbed and ready to tear
the caravan into splinters.

451
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,553  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:484 Y2:516
You are right.

452
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,356  X1:152 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:516
You left your hearth for a while
and now you are the martyr...

453
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,312  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:516
Go home
before I reach for my stick!

454
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,954  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:516
I used to know some verses
fitting the most terrible situations.

455
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:21,629  X1:154 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:510
Unfortunately I only remember
the first line:

456
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,596  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:483 Y2:516
""Take to your heels...""

457
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,279  X1:187 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:516
Don't you know the rest?

458
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,232  X1:229 X2:491 Y1:448 Y2:516
No.
But the abbé might.

459
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,869  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:448 Y2:510
...she was dancing
in the circus Ferdinand

460
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,439  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:484 Y2:516
with a pear in her mouth.

461
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:05,557  X1:189 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:510
People called it eccentric
and I do think

462
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,153  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:484 Y2:516
it was far from becoming.

463
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,718  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:484 Y2:516
Freshh lips need no ornament.

464
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,673  X1:292 X2:428 Y1:484 Y2:516
Oh, major

465
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:28,189  X1:096 X2:624 Y1:448 Y2:510
Displaying the mechanism of her joints
and the contraction-of her muscular

466
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,438  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:449 Y2:516
system
Anna is the personification

467
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:37,034  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:510
of all that constitutes
the roots of theatrical art

468
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:43,595  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:516
a glorification of God
who created men in his own image.

469
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,513  X1:319 X2:399 Y1:484 Y2:510
Anna!

470
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,996  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:516
Where have you been?

471
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,272  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:510
I stopped at the swimming-bath
it is in shambles!

472
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,399  X1:172 X2:548 Y1:484 Y2:516
What have you been doing?

473
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,110  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:484 Y2:516
Oh, you have come for your things.

474
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:04,069  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:483 Y2:516
Take them and get out of here!

475
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,997  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:484 Y2:516
I decided to forgive you.

476
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,074  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:516
You got your desert
for you faithlessness

477
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,949  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:516
living for three days
in an untidy, neglected home

478
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,270  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:448 Y2:516
without proper meals
and a good night's rest.

479
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,039  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:448 Y2:516
I can no longer be
angry with you, Antonín.

480
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,716  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:484 Y2:510
So much the better.

481
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,633  X1:245 X2:473 Y1:448 Y2:516
But my defects
are past remedy.

482
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:33,990  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:516
Today I saw a woman
washing linen in the river.

483
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,278  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:516
She was not as pretty as Anna
and yet I felt

484
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:41,954  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:448 Y2:510
I had not changed.
Silence!

485
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,593  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:448 Y2:516
You may stay
but mind your tongue!

486
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:53,114  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:484 Y2:515
Oh, how beautiful...

487
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,075  X1:204 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:516
Look where you hit
you might hurt my girl.

488
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,839  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:448 Y2:516
Your girl?
Your girl?

489
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,633  X1:177 X2:543 Y1:484 Y2:516
Have you lost you senses?

490
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,029  X1:162 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:516
No, because Anna stays here
and you go away.

491
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,832  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:510
Let us be lenient
with the weakness of our friends.

492
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,678  X1:276 X2:442 Y1:484 Y2:510
Let him live!

493
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,239  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:516
Don't kill the major!

494
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,593  X1:243 X2:477 Y1:484 Y2:516
Are you all right?

495
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:43,789  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:516
This morning the magician
beat me up with his wand.

496
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,075  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:448 Y2:516
I have still more reason
for complaining.

497
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,760  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:484 Y2:510
Katherine has returned home!

498
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:00,072  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:484 Y2:510
This is an unfortunate summer indeed.
