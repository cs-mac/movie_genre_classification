00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
JUMPING THE BROOM (2011)

2
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,436
Wow! Where did you come from?

3
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:43,738
You're beautiful, caring.

4
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,609
And don't get me started
about that sexy body.

5
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,944
You're the type of woman a man keeps.

6
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:56,982
And I know you're working later,
but, baby, I need to see you tonight.

7
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,321
Well, I wanna see you tonight, too.

8
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,025
Baby, can I call you right back?

9
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,495
Yeah. No, I promise.

10
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:08,526
All right, sexy. Yeah, I gotta go.
No, I promise, I promise.

11
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,098
All right, beautiful. Bye.

12
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:13,763
Breakfast?

13
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:19,671
I gotta go. I just remembered
I have a 10:00 o'clock photo shoot.

14
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,676
Oh, God, I did it again.

15
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,532
I gave up the cookie for a cute face,

16
00:01:27,784 --> 00:01:30,018
nice body,
and some mediocre conversation.

17
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,151
I don't even think
he can spell "mediocre."

18
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,688
I promise, God, again,

19
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,664
that if you get me out of this situation
with some dignity...

20
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,134
Okay, just get me out of here.

21
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:47,640
I promise to only share my cookies
with my future husband.

22
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,698
No more of this.

23
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:54,236
And, God, because it's obvious
I don't know how to spot a human being,

24
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:58,307
could you please make it clear
who you want me to be with?

25
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,909
I mean, clear clear,
the kind of clear that...

26
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:02,887
-Hey...
-Oh, my God!

27
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,019
Oh, my God! Oh, no!

28
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,783
Are you okay? Oh, my God!

29
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,455
Sir, are you okay?

30
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,396
I am so sorry! I didn't see you.
I mean, you came out of nowhere.

31
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,262
I could've killed you. Do you know that?

32
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,995
I could've killed you! Are you okay?

33
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,537
You look okay, but you could be dying
of internal bleeding,

34
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,869
where people have concussions
and they think they're fine

35
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,135
and then they go to sleep
and then they never wake up.

36
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,437
You could be dying.

37
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,674
-Oh, my God, I killed you.
-I'm not dead. I'm alive.

38
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,806
Well, listen, my name is Sabrina Watson.

39
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,317
I have great insurance
and an excellent dry cleaner.

40
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,580
I even have a good enough job
to pay for dinner.

41
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,384
I clearly owe you, and you could have
whatever you want on the menu.

42
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,425
-Well, except for the cookie plate.
-Sabrina?

43
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,050
Sabrina Watson?

44
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,317
Breathe.

45
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:50,927
I'm fine.

46
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:02,069
God, did I say
how much I love your sense of humor?

47
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,975
-Verdict?
-Amazing.

48
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,647
My parents took me to see Carmen
when I was a little girl.

49
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:13,988
Back then, you know, all that mattered
to me was the music and the costumes.

50
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,259
But now, I realize it's all about love
and anger and how they're linked,

51
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,627
-but, ultimately...
-Incompatible.

52
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,660
Jason Taylor, you are full of surprises.

53
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:24,964
Babe, I have you to thank for it.

54
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,843
I mean, to think that I grew up
in this city

55
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:29,532
and all this time I had no idea...

56
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,042
Come on, let's go.

57
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,304
...that all this was available to us.

58
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,005
-I mean, opera?
-You liked it?

59
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,274
-I loved it.
-Really?

60
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,543
But, babe, you can't tell the guys
about all the stuff we do.

61
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:40,279
They're still hazing me
about the picnic we had in Central Park.

62
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,446
-Okay, fine.
-You promise?

63
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,547
-Pinky swear.
-I trust you.

64
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,886
So, I hear the Peking Opera
is fantastic.

65
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,362
Supposedly, it's like nothing
you've ever seen before.

66
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,625
Peking?

67
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,366
You got the offer.

68
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:58,632
It's cutting-edge IP law
and a 20% pay raise.

69
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,502
-Wow.
-Couldn't say no.

70
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,269
I understand. Congrats.

71
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,173
When would you start?

72
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,780
-Two months.
-Two months?

73
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,640
-So soon?
-Yeah.

74
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,311
Wow. Two months.

75
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:16,287
Jason, I know we haven't been together
that long,

76
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:20,622
and I probably have no right to
ask you this, but I just feel like...

77
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,021
I don't know.

78
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,566
Do you think we could
try to make it work?

79
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,728
Babe, China is really far away.

80
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,036
-I don't know.
-There's the telephone

81
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,802
-and Internet and Skype, and...
-Skype.

82
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,503
And I'd be back every two months
for meetings.

83
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,839
Look...

84
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,579
I just... The long distance thing, I...

85
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,480
I don't know.
I don't... I don't believe in it.

86
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,787
So, what does that mean?

87
00:04:54,861 --> 00:05:00,424
It means that you have a really
good opportunity in front of you,

88
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,699
and I'm not gonna stand
in the way of it.

89
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:10,005
Well, it sounds to me
like you made up your mind.

90
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,973
It was a fun night.

91
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:29,093
You're such a perfect lover

92
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:35,728
And, baby, you could do better than me

93
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:40,136
But you stuck by me like a soldier

94
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:46,774
Sweet loving until...

95
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,404
Look, Sabrina,

96
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,146
ever since I met you, I've felt like...

97
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,553
Like I can accomplish anything,
anywhere.

98
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,890
New York, China. It doesn't matter,
as long as we're together.

99
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,260
You've introduced me to a world

100
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,026
that I can't even begin
to imagine living without you.

101
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,692
I don't want to.

102
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,603
I want you in my life forever.

103
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,674
Sabrina, I prayed on it,

104
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,545
and God answered me with you.

105
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,776
Sabrina Watson,

106
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,316
would you marry me?

107
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,454
You scared me!

108
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,590
Babe, is that a yes?

109
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:38,721
Yes!

110
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,800
-You said yes, right?
-Yes.

111
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,069
Come here.

112
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:55,170
I'm so unpredictable
yet your love's unconditional for me

113
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:59,343
And I wanna know why

114
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:04,015
How can you love me so much, girl?

115
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:09,388
Put up with all of the crazy things I do

116
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,653
It's incredible.

117
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,823
-You like it?
-It's amazing.

118
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:33,550
JUMPING THE BROOM

119
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,880
Mabel?

120
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:19,857
Let's give each of the couples
an extra bag of the wasabi peanuts.

121
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,917
Yes, Mrs. Watson.

122
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,655
-I'm sorry.
-Amy. Are you okay?

123
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,924
Yes, I tend to get a little nervous
before a big event.

124
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,090
You do plan big events for a living, no?

125
00:09:28,095 --> 00:09:32,060
Yes, I do, ma'am.
And as to yours, tomorrow is day one.

126
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:36,973
The workmen will arrive in the morning
to hoist the tent for the reception.

127
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,734
Jason and Sabrina will meet with
Reverend James to discuss the service.

128
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,313
The bulk of the guests will be arriving
on the midday ferry,

129
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,543
followed by 3:00 pm, the rehearsal.

130
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,643
And then cocktails
and the rehearsal dinner in the tent.

131
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,086
Amy, remember, I just want everything
to be very simple,

132
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,885
elegant and modern, you know?

133
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,586
And I need to have a long table

134
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,424
so we can all sit together
like one big, happy family.

135
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,988
That is gonna be so fun to do
at the round tables I was told to order.

136
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,697
Right. Not to worry about that.
I'll just make that go bye-bye.

137
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,602
-Good.
-Continue.

138
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:11,734
Right. Day two, the big day, Saturday.
Breakfast on the deck.

139
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,939
Later, the women will primp and groom
while the men play football.

140
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,778
A Watson family tradition
I wish I could ignore.

141
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,476
Like the round tables,
I can make that go away.

142
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,050
Back to the wedding.

143
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,957
All right, rental chairs and lanterns
will be arranged here on the lawn.

144
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,129
The ceremony begins at 2:00 pm sharp
with dinner and dancing to follow.

145
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,958
And on Sunday morning, Jason and I
will be Mr, and Mrs. Jason Edgar Taylor.

146
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,127
Girl!

147
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,703
-Oh, wow. Okay.
-Yeah.

148
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,866
-Well, I'm gonna check on...
-What's wrong?

149
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,075
Mom, come on.

150
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:52,379
It's just... It's just all so rushed.

151
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:55,386
No time for an engagement party
or bridal shower.

152
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:59,720
Really, Sabrina.
It looks as if we have no home training.

153
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:03,785
We should've taken months to plan this.
Really, why the rush?

154
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,156
If you're pregnant, you can tell me.

155
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:09,027
For the millionth time,
no, I'm not pregnant.

156
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,826
Okay? Trust me.

157
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:13,770
Jason and I are in love, really in love.

158
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,472
We wanna go to China
as husband and wife, a team.

159
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,375
Jason makes a good impression,
but we haven't met his family yet.

160
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,135
What are they like?

161
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,841
Amy! Let's put some greens in
with the roses, okay?

162
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,440
-For, like, a pop of color.
-Sabrina.

163
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:29,016
And Bellinis. Mom, you love Bellinis.
Let's serve Bellinis as well, okay?

164
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,419
-Sabrina!
-Yes?

165
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,719
-What are they like?
-I don't know.

166
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,022
You don't know? Sabrina,
your father and I have invested

167
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,119
over half a million dollars
in your education.

168
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,222
-Communicate.
-I haven't met them yet.

169
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,267
I know. I tried, but it was
hard for Jason to work it out!

170
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,668
-Sabrina!
-Mrs. Taylor is a very busy woman.

171
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,331
-Sabrina.
-Mom,

172
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,808
everybody's gonna love each other

173
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,901
because Jason and I love each other.

174
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:56,106
How can you say you love him
when you don't know them?

175
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,673
They could be awful

176
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,343
-or:::
-Or great.

177
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:04,289
-Come on. You worry too much!
-No, you don't worry enough.

178
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,847
Well, it's all under control.
Right, Amy?

179
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:10,885
-Okay, Miss O'Neal. Next!
-So, when are you leaving?

180
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,487
You know all those people over
at the Vineyard,

181
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,125
they are so loaded,
even their servants are rich.

182
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:19,271
I can't believe little Jason
is getting married this weekend,

183
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,737
and I'm not gonna be there.

184
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,305
Well,
of course you're not gonna be there.

185
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:26,208
You wearing a ankle bracelet
and it's not for fashion. Next!

186
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,336
What's the girl like?

187
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,382
Miss O'Neal, go on, now.
I gotta go to work. Next!

188
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,644
Come on up here, baby.
Hurry up. I ain't got all day.

189
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,084
What?

190
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,718
-One minute, baby.
-Come on, girl, don't...

191
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,285
-Shonda!
-Pam, I'm busy.

192
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,058
You see this long line
we have out here?

193
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,463
Excuse us, excuse us.

194
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,291
-What's the problem, Pam?
-I have tried to be nice to this girl,

195
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,167
but you know by now she should've come
over here to Brooklyn to meet me.

196
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,931
You will not believe it.

197
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:58,670
She sent me a text message.
A text message!

198
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:01,577
Talking 'bout she want me
to bring some baby pictures of Jason

199
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:04,013
so she can put 'em
in the wedding program.

200
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:08,110
She treating me like I'm her secretary,
not the mother-in-law to be!

201
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,951
She got Jason's nose all open, talking
about she gonna take him to China.

202
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,753
China! My Jason don't like
nothing sweet and sour.

203
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,817
This girl need to
have a little more respect for me!

204
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,624
Why are your panties all in a wad?

205
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:21,462
Didn't you tell me that Jason hadn't
met her family, either?

206
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,001
Heifer, whose side you on?

207
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,232
All this stuff going on,
her text messaging me

208
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:30,264
when she can pick up a telephone
and call me like I'm a human being.

209
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,572
I don't play this. Strike one.

210
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,208
Don't forget about
your anger management classes, Pam.

211
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,647
Calm down.

212
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:45,289
Honey, you gonna have
to go get back in line.

213
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:46,449
I'm going to lunch.

214
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,815
What?

215
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,861
Our guests arrive tomorrow,
so we will need to prepare every room.

216
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:55,128
All the linens need to be changed.
The floors need to sparkle.

217
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,328
-And sparkle they will, Mrs. Watson.
-Each of the guest rooms

218
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,301
needs to get a bouquet
of summer flowers.

219
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,601
-Yes, Mrs. Watson.
-And we have to assemble the gift boxes

220
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,198
-for all of our out-of-town guests.
-Yes, Mrs. Watson.

221
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,803
Where in hell are you?

222
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,372
Meeting ran long.
I'm on my way to the airport now.

223
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,044
Did you forget that we have 50 people
arriving here tomorrow

224
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,347
for our daughter's wedding?

225
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:18,288
Your sarcasm is unattractive.

226
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,451
Gregory, I cannot tolerate
one of your disappearing acts.

227
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,791
-I am not doing this alone.
-Yeah. Calm down.

228
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,263
You're not alone. Like I said,
I'm on my way to the airport.

229
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,426
Where were we?

230
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,661
All right. Where were we?

231
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,874
Yeah. Dissolution of property.

232
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,474
Gregg, I can't keep up this charade.

233
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:46,343
I've known Claudine for a long time,
and I do owe her a modicum of respect.

234
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,351
You have to tell her, or I will.

235
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:05,849
Jason!

236
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,859
-Wifey-to-be, wifey-to-be.
-What are you doing?

237
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,622
God, the stairs weren't good enough
for you?

238
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:14,063
I'm old school, babe. I got the horse
double-parked downstairs.

239
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,361
You know how they do it in the movies?

240
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,039
What's wrong, babe?

241
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,505
I'm just really nervous
about meeting your mom.

242
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,434
I need to know more about her.

243
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,377
-Like what?
-I don't know, just, you know, details.

244
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:31,643
Details are what make a person.

245
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,845
Like what's her taste in art?
Is she more MoMA or Met?

246
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,649
-Does she eat sushi or soul food?
-Baby...

247
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,587
Does she wanna play Mahalia Jackson
or Michael Jackson?

248
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,052
Breathe.

249
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,886
Okay. Let's see, my mom.

250
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,087
She's a very sweet...

251
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:47,558
Yeah?

252
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,602
...gentle, soft-spoken woman.

253
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:51,931
-Really?
-Just like you.

254
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,302
Come here.

255
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,974
-Oh, God.
-I know, I know.

256
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:16,088
Wait. Oh, my gosh.
Sorry, Jason, I'm sorry.

257
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,360
-I'm sorry, I just...
-I know.

258
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,195
-I can't do that.
-The promise you made with God, right?

259
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,703
-Yes, and you should respect it.
-I respect it, babe, but it ain't easy.

260
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,363
I mean, look at you. I mean, come on.

261
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,931
-Can we just keep that open?
-No, we can't. We can talk.

262
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,704
-Talk?
-Yes.

263
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:34,436
French.

264
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,414
I don't know what to say.

265
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,678
Just say anything.

266
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,511
Please don't be mad.

267
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,149
But I am afraid that when we're on
our honeymoon,

268
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,419
It will be that time of the month.

269
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,355
I don't know what you just said,
but it sounded so good.

270
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,897
Did it?

271
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,794
Sabrina! Reverend James is here!

272
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,162
See? You hear that?

273
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,964
That's God talking through my mom.

274
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:01,633
Oh, my God.

275
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,809
You couldn't control it?

276
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,470
I'm okay with this waiting thing,

277
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,173
but he is pissed
at my choice in women right now.

278
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:15,612
-Say you're sorry. Say you're sorry.
-I'm sorry. Kind of.

279
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:16,847
-It's not working.
-Not really.

280
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,947
-French?
-Get outta here.

281
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:21,049
-Sabrina!
-I'm coming, Mom!

282
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,055
Maybe we could get to the last detail
of this wedding, the reading.

283
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,691
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
I was thinking Jude, Chapter three.

284
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,406
"The quality of mercy is not strained.

285
00:19:30,524 --> 00:19:33,063
It falls like a gentle rain
from the heavens."

286
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:34,230
That's Shakespeare.

287
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,206
-That's not Jude three?
-There is no Jude three.

288
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:38,470
-There's no Jude three?
-No.

289
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:43,406
I was thinking Corinthians 13.
"Love is patient, love is kind."

290
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,279
How about John 15?
That's my mother's favorite.

291
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,910
Well, it's our wedding, so...

292
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:51,251
Well, babe, it would really make
my mother happy, come on.

293
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,253
Yeah. And when she gets married again,
they can read it for her, okay?

294
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,856
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
hold up a minute.

295
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,457
Maybe we should just
look at Genesis 2:24.

296
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,696
It says, "For this cause shall a man
leave his mother and his father

297
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,828
"and take unto him a wife

298
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,737
"and then they shall cleave
and become one flesh."

299
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,873
Now, that... That feels good.

300
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,810
That is a good one. That's a good one.

301
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,338
Could we possibly get back
to you on this one, Rev?

302
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:19,575
Certainly, certainly.

303
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:20,709
Let's talk about it.

304
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,686
Sabrina, dear,

305
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,053
I understand that you love each other

306
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:28,490
and that you're maybe even meant
to be together.

307
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:35,366
But I should warn you that
sometimes life will really test you.

308
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:40,370
Well, we'll pass. I mean,
Reverend James, Jason was sent to me.

309
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,100
He's my soul mate.

310
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,367
That's so sweet.

311
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:49,739
But even a soul mate
can really test you.

312
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,681
You've known me since I was just
a wee little thing, and now...

313
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,450
-Pigtails and braces.
-Yes!

314
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:01,458
-Look at you now. So wonderful.
-That's right. Can you believe it?

315
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:05,189
I tell you what,
I'm gonna have to leave you lovebirds

316
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,596
and get on back to the church

317
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,157
so we can have
this marvelous wedding of yours.

318
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,032
Thank you!

319
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,799
-Be sweet, dear.
-Thank you so much.

320
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:16,033
-And take care.
-Thanks.

321
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,631
-We'll talk soon.
-All right, Rev.

322
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,939
-All the best. See you all. Bye-bye.
-All right, see you tomorrow.

323
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,274
-Take care.
-Bye.

324
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,212
It's almost noon.
I gotta go pick up my mom, all right?

325
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,945
No, no, no, no!
You're not going anywhere.

326
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,078
-What do you mean, babe?
-Amy sent a car for her.

327
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:31,748
-Amy sent a car for my mom?
-Yes.

328
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,690
Babe, this ain't gonna be good.

329
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,827
What do you mean?
I'm sure it was a nice car.

330
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,122
Show her how to pose, will you?

331
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:45,430
Oh, my goodness! Stop all that now!

332
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,231
All right, just smile, Pam! Okay...

333
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,005
Don't touch my baby's pie!

334
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:44,092
-Where's Willie Earl?
-No, he could be anywhere.

335
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:50,794
I see you been around the world.
You got a few stamps in your passport.

336
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,962
It's none of your business.

337
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:57,131
Just trying to
have a polite conversation.

338
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,645
I'm sure whatever distant land
you come from that line about stamps

339
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,306
may work as a natural aphrodisiac.

340
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,078
To me, however, it's just country.

341
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,789
Ain't nothing wrong
with a little biscuit and gravy.

342
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,786
Please.

343
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,221
Don't walk away from your future.

344
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:20,822
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Please get me out of here.

345
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,569
See, that's what I'm talking about.

346
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:30,664
-Be careful with that.
-He know what he doing.

347
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:38,448
Shonda, I am trying to be nice,
but who are they trying to impress?

348
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,610
A car? A driver?

349
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:44,177
Why couldn't they send somebody from
the family down here to pick us up?

350
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,054
And where the hell is Jason?
What you looking at?

351
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,453
Girl, what you think I'm looking at?

352
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,519
It's August in the Vineyard.
I'm looking for Barack and Michelle.

353
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,961
Oh, God.

354
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,231
Have you seen Sabrina? Thank you.

355
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,326
No, but, Mrs. Watson,
the calligrapher broke her arm

356
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:00,928
and she can't finish the guest cards.
So, I was...

357
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:07,041
Okay. And that's not your problem.
That's my problem. Moving on.

358
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,443
The bedrooms are all ready.

359
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,154
Thank you, Mabel. Have you seen Sabrina?

360
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,579
I'm right here, Mom.

361
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:13,442
Where's Sebastian?

362
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,543
He missed the ferry, but he'll be here
for the cocktail party.

363
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,781
-You all are working my last nerve.
-Relax.

364
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:19,790
-Hey! Sweetie!
-Hi, Dad.

365
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:22,383
So good to see you!

366
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,089
All right, they'll be here any minute.
Go change.

367
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:27,961
That sounded a little bit like,
"Go fetch."

368
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,960
Dad, Mom is right.

369
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:33,300
You need to make a good impression
on my future mother-in-law, okay?

370
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:34,395
Absolutely, sweetie.

371
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,872
Thanks, Dad.

372
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,441
-That's them! They're here!
-Mom, how do I look?

373
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:42,707
-Do I have anything in my teeth?
-Sabrina.

374
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,976
-What about my nose?
-Sabrina, that is vile.

375
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:46,748
Now, remember who you are.

376
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,484
You are my angel.

377
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,652
Hello.

378
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:57,556
Claudine.

379
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:01,293
-Geneva.
-Auntie! You made it!

380
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,828
Look at you. You're beautiful.

381
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,503
Why didn't you respond
to the wedding invitation?

382
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,405
The mail on the island
is so unpredictable.

383
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,035
Are there no phones on the island?

384
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:15,636
-Claudie.
-Mom.

385
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:19,310
Where are you staying?

386
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,419
In Grand-Mère's old room, of course.

387
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:23,886
-See? Room for me.
-Come on. I have so much to tell you!

388
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,651
I can't wait to show you
what I bought you. It's see-through.

389
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,659
-So, it's really a gift for Jason.
-And where is he?

390
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:30,957
I need to see the man
who stole my little girl's heart.

391
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,021
Auntie, you are going to love him.
First of all...

392
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:39,002
Just bring 'em in here and drop 'em.
Drop 'em right here. Put it...

393
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:43,365
She sure can pack for a two-day wedding.

394
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:48,041
You know, if you don't mind me asking,
Mrs. Watson, she's like a...

395
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,808
She's like a couple shades lighter
than you.

396
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,475
Is that... Is that the normal kind...

397
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:59,084
Fair question. She's like a mocha.

398
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:02,718
You're like a... I don't know,
like a milk chocolate.

399
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,522
Got it.

400
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:10,231
It's pretty nasty. What is this, Auntie?

401
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:13,532
Now, now, this is not
for your honeymoon night. No, no, no.

402
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:17,006
No, this is for when you guys fight
or you want something expensive.

403
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,105
You put this on

404
00:26:18,181 --> 00:26:20,797
-and you cook him some dinner.
-Got it.

405
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,615
I might not know anything
about marriage,

406
00:26:22,701 --> 00:26:25,614
but I do know
how to help you guys stay married.

407
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:27,242
Auntie, I think you got the perfect one.

408
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,412
-I love it! It's the best.
-Good!

409
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,590
-I love you, chérie.
-I love you so much.

410
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,516
Do everybody out here
got their own boat?

411
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,027
I don't wanna get on
no boats around here.

412
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,120
Make you feel
like they're taking you back to Africa.

413
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:40,557
This place is amazing.

414
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,202
This is so beautiful.
Look at these houses!

415
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,364
You know, I was thinking
I could represent Jason's father,

416
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,035
say a few kind words over dinner
about love and marriage.

417
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,744
Okay, so now you a pro at marriage?

418
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,280
-Could be.
-All right.

419
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:59,381
So, how many marriages have you had,
Willie Earl?

420
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,816
-Three.
-Who?

421
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,616
Four, four, four, four times.

422
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:06,088
But I married one of them twice.

423
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,484
And don't forget about that fiasco
in Mexico last year, remember that?

424
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:12,291
No, Willie Earl, she was fine.
I would've went to Mexico for that.

425
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,355
What a brother will do for the taco.

426
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:16,593
And a burrito and rice and beans.

427
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,795
You probably left a baby down there,
Willie Earl.

428
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,303
Come on, Pam.

429
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,930
Come on, Pammy Pam.

430
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:26,004
So what they didn't come meet us at
the dock, and you haven't met the girl?

431
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:28,511
But we're here now.
Can we please have a good time?

432
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,048
I don't care what y'all talking about.
This is nice.

433
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,277
Get picked up like this every day.

434
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:45,955
They got their own lake or something?

435
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,122
Are you serious?

436
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,407
-You guys, look at that! Oh, my God!
-This is nice.

437
00:27:53,412 --> 00:27:55,604
You guys,
it's like the Kennedy Compound!

438
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,073
That's gotta be an apartment complex.

439
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,234
They got workers and everything.

440
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,971
Look at 'em.
They got white people working.

441
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,308
I bet they got, like, five bathrooms.

442
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,780
-Doing good for theyself.
-Come on, y'all. Calm down.

443
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,646
We done seen houses bigger than this.

444
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:09,353
-Where?
-No, we haven't!

445
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,412
Black folks own this? No.

446
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,986
They're dressing 'em different now.
You look rich.

447
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,256
Well,
does money make you more beautiful?

448
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:21,787
If you fat and unattractive,
money certainly will help.

449
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,536
-Willie Earl.
-Hey, whassup, Jay?

450
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,500
-How you doing, man? Good to see you.
-My love to you, boy.

451
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,203
Long time no see.

452
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,912
Welcome to the Vineyard, Mom.

453
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,676
-You sent a car to get your mother?
-Only the best for you.

454
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,184
Well, the best would've been
for you to pick me up.

455
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,550
I love you, too, Mom.
Mom, this is Sabrina.

456
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:44,713
Hello.

457
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:51,862
Hi! Mrs. Taylor!
It is so nice to finally meet you!

458
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,227
Isn't she great, Mom?

459
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,698
I'm sorry. I just...

460
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,258
I didn't think a handshake
expressed the moment, you know?

461
00:28:58,336 --> 00:28:59,462
No.

462
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:01,732
I'm a hugger. I like to hug.

463
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:02,932
I can see that.

464
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,166
Sorry.

465
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,938
I'm Claudine Watson.

466
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:09,070
Pam Taylor.

467
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:12,913
Well, may I say that you've certainly
raised a wonderful man.

468
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,542
Thank you. He is wonderful.

469
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,610
I wish I could say the same about you
and your daughter.

470
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:25,522
I said that the wrong way.
I mean, I wish I had met her earlier,

471
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:30,398
-before now, and then I could say...
-This is my family.

472
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,561
Shonda. She is my mom's best friend.

473
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:34,432
-How you doing?
-Hello.

474
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,200
Uncle Willie Earl.

475
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:39,899
Rich and fine.

476
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,569
Fine as a glass of wine.

477
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,170
And my cousin, Malcolm.

478
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:47,451
I invited the two of them to stay here.
I hope that's okay.

479
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,152
Mom.

480
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,953
Yes, yes.
I mean, we certainly have enough room.

481
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,856
Why don't we go into the house,
make you more comfortable.

482
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,188
You guys have to be so thirsty.

483
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,290
We have Bellinis.
I hope you like Bellinis.

484
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,426
-Bellinis. What the hell is that?
-Yes, yes.

485
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:05,560
It is so good.

486
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,803
I want some Coca-Cola...

487
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,470
-Come on in, everyone.
-Thank you.

488
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:13,875
Bellini for you, Mom.

489
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,468
-No, no, no, no.
-No? You sure?

490
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:19,778
Everyone, come on into the living room.

491
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,783
William Earl, Michael?

492
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:27,382
-Malcolm.
-Malcolm. Pardon me, Malcolm.

493
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,824
Please, have a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

494
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:32,328
-Welcome, welcome.
-Is this...

495
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:37,195
I made Jason a sweet potato pie.
It's his favorite.

496
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:38,963
Well, what a lovely gift.

497
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,733
Yeah, no, she's famous all over
Brooklyn for her pies.

498
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:44,104
Really? We'll have to serve it tonight
at the rehearsal dinner.

499
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,700
No, no, no.
This is for Jason and his friends.

500
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:50,077
It's just that my buddies always fight
over her pies.

501
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,809
She's a really, really good cook.

502
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:55,284
Well, Mrs. Taylor, you really need
to share your recipes with me.

503
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,116
Hear a way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.

504
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,886
It's a family secret.

505
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,319
Well...

506
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,853
It's a good thing we're all
gonna be family after tomorrow.

507
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:09,164
Where can I put this?

508
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:10,326
You can shove it...

509
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,392
-In the kitchen.
-Thank you, Mabel.

510
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,666
Hello! Hello.

511
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:16,872
-Dad!
-Gregg Watson.

512
00:31:17,305 --> 00:31:19,963
You must be Jason's sister.

513
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:22,846
No. I'm his mother.

514
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:29,352
Jason, why have you
kept this jewel hidden from us?

515
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,285
-My apologies.
-Thank you.

516
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,790
We are so sorry you couldn't make it
to lunch with us last month.

517
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,756
You all went to lunch together?

518
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,396
-Where?
-21 .

519
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,562
-21 .
-It was phenomenal.

520
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,430
Well, Jason told us that you were busy.

521
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,793
Busy?

522
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:47,167
It was really last-minute, Mom.

523
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:58,542
Well, Mrs. Taylor, allow me to show you
and Shondra to your living quarters.

524
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,343
This way, please.

525
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,890
It's Shonda.

526
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,928
21? Strike two.

527
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:13,457
Here we go.

528
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:16,493
"It's a family secret"? What was that?

529
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,596
If I can't have your cookies,
you can't have my pies.

530
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:22,605
Hello! Maid of honor in the house!

531
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,801
Blythe! Oh, my goodness!

532
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,210
Look at you, you look so good.

533
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,839
You are just in time to counsel the
bride with a mother-in-law situation.

534
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,245
Well, as long as you pay me in Moët.

535
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,079
-Done. Come on.
-Let's do it.

536
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:36,278
Excuse me.

537
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:39,782
How you doing? I'm Malcolm. And you are?

538
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,983
-Blythe.
-Blythe, Blythe, Blythe.

539
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,254
So, I hear you the maid of honor.

540
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,422
Well, I'm the best man,

541
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,191
so there's gotta be some kind of ritual
we can do

542
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:49,165
to get to know each other better.

543
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:54,394
There is. There is.
It's called stop touching me.

544
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:59,205
-Okay.
-Bellini, lovely.

545
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:01,204
Bellini?

546
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,837
Now, that's that boomerang game,
brother.

547
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,142
-She gonna come back.
-Okay.

548
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,445
No, I mean, I feel so fresh.

549
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,555
You didn't use that thing, did you?

550
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,149
You know I did.

551
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,260
And you know what I realize?

552
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,889
That rich people are not happy
because of the money.

553
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:22,899
They're happy because of the bidets.

554
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,060
The bidets make you wanna go out
and make more money

555
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,229
-so you could buy some more bidets.
-Listen,

556
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,029
they have those bidets
because they're full of it.

557
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,099
What, you brought a broom?

558
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,406
Honey, this isn't just any broom.

559
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:37,505
This is the broom that Mike
and I jumped when we got married.

560
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:40,617
You know, I don't know
why I feel like a bald-headed stepchild

561
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:42,652
at my own son's wedding.

562
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,085
And all that talk about
they didn't have time

563
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:47,056
for her to come across the bridge
and meet me is just a lie.

564
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,355
Then they gonna go to 21 without me.

565
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,091
Yeah, Jason, he should've told you.

566
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:55,599
There's no reason why they should've
had that party without you or me.

567
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,168
It wasn't Jason.
He'd never do that to me.

568
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,932
It was that little ugly girl
in that teeny tiny dress.

569
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,730
-Oh, my God!
-What is it?

570
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:07,710
Rich folks got good taste in property,
but bad taste in snacks.

571
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,173
Knock, knock!

572
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,112
-Hi.
-Hi.

573
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:16,286
I hope everything's okay with the room.

574
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,654
So, I just...
I wanted to make sure we're all set

575
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,216
for the fitting tomorrow morning.

576
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,457
-Fitting?
-Yeah, Jason didn't tell you?

577
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:27,924
He's such a man.

578
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:30,490
I bought you two dresses to choose from.

579
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,531
-For?
-The wedding.

580
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,632
Honey, no. I dress myself. Thank you.

581
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:38,038
I know,

582
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,737
but, you see, I wanted everyone
to wear the same shade of buff tomorrow,

583
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:41,904
for the optics.

584
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:43,207
Optics?

585
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,339
The photographs.

586
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:48,351
You mean pictures? Well, then just
say pictures. Say pictures.

587
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,787
-Pictures.
-Well, if you had mentioned a dress

588
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,381
in that lovely text message
you sent yesterday,

589
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:56,689
then I would not have gone out
and bought this one.

590
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,195
I mean, this got buff.

591
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,092
Buff, that's white, right?
White is buff?

592
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,634
-See? Lot of white in this.
-Yeah, kind of, but...

593
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:06,568
It's just...

594
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,499
Would you mind wearing one
of the dresses?

595
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,971
I'll have my father reimburse you.
You don't mind, do you?

596
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,137
It's just, it's my wedding,
and I was hoping that...

597
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,510
Okay, okay, I'll wear your dress.

598
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:17,673
Really?

599
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:18,976
Thank you!

600
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:23,881
I was...

601
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:26,879
Sorry. Just...

602
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,287
Okay. Well...

603
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:30,754
I hope you enjoy the box.

604
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:32,753
My mom made it special.

605
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,225
I'll see you at the rehearsal dinner.

606
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,633
And I really think you're gonna love
either one of the dresses.

607
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:45,736
Buff usually looks good on everyone.
Just as a general rule of thumb, so...

608
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,002
Okay.

609
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,645
Girl, I'm really proud of you.

610
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:55,049
I mean, really, that anger management
class must've really paid off.

611
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,155
That is strike three.

612
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:01,615
Who shows up with extra weekend guests?
It's just so...

613
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:02,681
Ghetto?

614
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,124
I was gonna say simple.

615
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:08,495
Mère Claudine would have put them back
on the ferry

616
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:11,091
faster than they could say
"sweet potato pie."

617
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,464
She nearly banned Gregory's parents
from our wedding.

618
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:16,699
They never acted up again.

619
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,836
I wish I could say the same
for their son.

620
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,378
There's nothing wrong with Gregory.

621
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,605
He invited his mistress to the wedding.

622
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,546
You don't know that to be true.

623
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:30,815
Mabel, I'm not a fool.
The signs have been there for a while.

624
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:39,227
Well, that Mrs. Taylor may be backwards,
but she sure can make a pie.

625
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,765
Mrs. Watson? There you are.

626
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,166
Hey. Hi, Mabel.

627
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,599
-Oh, Lord.
-So, I told Chef about our extra guests,

628
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,161
and he said, "There's no more chicken."

629
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,173
So, I suggested he serve salmon.

630
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:54,472
Well, he said they seem
like chicken people to him.

631
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,274
And I thought that sounded
a little bit offensive,

632
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:57,507
but given the history of our country,

633
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:00,016
I didn't think I was the one
who should point that out.

634
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,484
I really need him on my side
to pull this whole thing off.

635
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,149
So, anyway, bottom line,

636
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,852
he refuses to make any new chicken

637
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:10,087
because he's already seasoned
the RSVP'd chicken, so, you know, help.

638
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,355
Thanks.

639
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,467
Hoods are good for a roll in the hay,
but you don't marry them.

640
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:22,973
I do agree with you,
but Jason has become a bootstrapper.

641
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,667
Hoods, bootstrappers, same thing.

642
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:26,307
I know, right?

643
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:27,867
Then the ushers take the mother
of the bride

644
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:31,073
and mother of the groom to their seats
on opposite sides of the aisle.

645
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:33,116
Dude, they're looking at me, ain't they?

646
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:35,049
Yeah, they're looking.

647
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,155
I ain't marrying nothing.

648
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:41,223
Talkin' about some China. Right.

649
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,524
I bet you good money that girl pregnant.

650
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,530
That's the only reason Jason would be
getting married this quick, bro.

651
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,759
No, I don't believe she's pregnant.

652
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,894
And I don't think Jason would
appreciate you spreading that rumor.

653
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,961
I ain't spreading a rumor,
I'm talking to you.

654
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:58,133
Okay, well,
maybe you should be talking to Jason.

655
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,905
What is that, that's your role here,
the rumor police?

656
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:04,379
No, I am a colleague.
Goldman Sachs, maybe you heard of it?

657
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,281
-No. -And the best man
takes his place right here.

658
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:09,342
Ricky, please.

659
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,614
-Wait, wait.
-Right this way.

660
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,519
-You the best man?
-Yeah.

661
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,024
Ricky, if I could get you up here.

662
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:19,387
-Hey, your cousin's hilarious.
-What's he up to now?

663
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:23,092
I don't know, he seems really interested
in you and Sabrina's love life.

664
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,657
Well, that makes two of us.

665
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,430
But in 23 more hours, guess what?

666
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,995
-I will be good to go.
-Okay.

667
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:32,042
How long have they been dating,
like, six months, right?

668
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:34,703
I guess they think it's romantic.

669
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:37,111
Well, I don't know. He might be
getting it from somewhere else

670
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,179
'cause the only guy I know
wait six months to have sex

671
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:43,117
is either on the low-down
or the down-low.

672
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:44,449
True.

673
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:45,546
I want you to be honest with me.

674
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:47,454
I'm gonna ask you something.
I wanna know right now.

675
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,550
-God, here we go.
-'Cause I know you, all right?

676
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,060
How are you doing this?

677
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:55,224
Let's see.
Lot of baby oil, medicated Vaseline.

678
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,358
-They have this new stuff...
-Okay, pause.

679
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:00,302
You asked. Let's just say
I've been handling the situation.

680
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,236
Yeah, apparently, for six months.

681
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:06,743
Yeah, six months. And guess what?
For Sabrina, I'd go another six months.

682
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,902
Just don't tell her I said that,
'cause I don't wanna give her any ideas.

683
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:14,576
I mean, seriously, like, what kind
of man waits that long to have sex?

684
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,882
The kind of man
I'm about to marry tomorrow.

685
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:20,754
And stop talking about me
and worry about your own sad situation.

686
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:21,720
Where'd this come from?

687
00:39:22,025 --> 00:39:24,420
The married one, or the
investment banker or the footballer?

688
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:26,190
-I can't keep up with you, Blythe.
-All of them.

689
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:28,891
Well, excuse me,
Miss "I-made-a-deal-with-God."

690
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,957
Just remember that I knew you when.

691
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:33,002
Yes, and you are going to be quiet
about that.

692
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,628
I am not talking about that
this weekend.

693
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,229
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

694
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:37,740
-You do you and I'll do me.
-Fine.

695
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:41,369
On that note, I'm gonna go get
another glass of champagne. This one.

696
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:44,608
-Blythe!
-Darling, your secrets are safe with me.

697
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,946
I don't understand this obsession
with chicken.

698
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,982
Come on, people,
put some pep in your step.

699
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,626
Let's go, people.
They're getting hungry outside.

700
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:00,656
And if these are not going out,
put 'em on ice, please.

701
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,265
Getting hot out there.

702
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:03,424
Pardon me.

703
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:04,798
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

704
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:07,497
-Excuse me.
-Watch the stove. It's hot.

705
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:10,531
Blythe.

706
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:13,135
Chef.

707
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,279
Excuse me.

708
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,729
We need to talk.

709
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,935
Could you pick a worse time?

710
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,179
You've always been great
at recognizing a moment.

711
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,343
Our guests are about to arrive.

712
00:40:57,388 --> 00:41:00,016
Sarcasm is something
your family always used

713
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,854
to keep from actually
talking to each other.

714
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:05,861
I'm getting pretty tired of it.

715
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,880
You shouldn't be out here
cleaning in this hot sun.

716
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:32,581
-Don't you worry, Miss. I'm okay.
-Is sunscreen something you would use?

717
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:33,645
-No.
-No.

718
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:38,952
So, is that Jason's crew?

719
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:42,797
Slim pickings, right?

720
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,697
Ricky's kind of cute, but what's up
with the pressed khakis and Top-Siders?

721
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:51,968
Analysis. He bought those clothes
to impress and look the part,

722
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:55,239
hoping that he would rub elbows
and maybe come up like Jason.

723
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:58,013
Don't talk about my boo like that.

724
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,647
You know, if you'd stop dating
from that crazy list of yours,

725
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,879
you might actually find a decent man.

726
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:04,181
I don't have a list.

727
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,984
You don't have a list?

728
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:07,284
I don't!

729
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:12,829
Okay, let's see, lvy League,
not by scholarship. Seven-figure salary.

730
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,057
Black Card, seasoned at least one year.

731
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:17,692
Laughs at all your jokes
and loves your mama.

732
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:19,736
Need I say more?

733
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:22,067
But what are you guys saying,
that I should lower my standards?

734
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:23,231
-Yeah.
-Yes!

735
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:25,275
-What?
-Because it's based in fantasy.

736
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,243
You gotta look through different eyes.
Open your mind to other possibilities.

737
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:30,207
Ladies, hey.

738
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:34,446
Sorry for ear-hustling over there,
but I agree with her.

739
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,713
You should open your eyes
to different possibilities.

740
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:39,146
See? No lvy League.

741
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:42,989
Seven figures? Not at all. Close
to five some years when I'm working.

742
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,393
But I get you, Blythe.
We should hook up.

743
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:49,195
-You and me.
-I'm a hermaphrodite.

744
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,229
I don't care what your religion is.

745
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,368
-It's more about us.
-Wow!

746
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,267
It's nature.

747
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,437
Listen, baby, this is the
perfect weekend, right? There's...

748
00:42:58,509 --> 00:42:59,771
-Ladies?
-Thank you.

749
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:03,537
Caviar is very fresh. You should try it.
Blythe, right?

750
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:05,840
Yeah.

751
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:08,217
I have something I want you to try.

752
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:11,945
Why don't you come with me?

753
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:13,517
Okay.

754
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:15,782
Excuse me.

755
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,830
What, what... What just happened?

756
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,631
-Thanks for rescuing me.
-My pleasure.

757
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:30,097
Thank you, sir.

758
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,368
I'm sorry.

759
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,070
I'm Sebastian.

760
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:40,176
I'm Shonda.

761
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:42,576
So, I'm guessing
you're a friend of the groom?

762
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,286
I'm his mama's best friend.

763
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:49,591
I'm the bride's cousin.

764
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:53,286
How old are you?

765
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:55,825
I'll be a senior next year at Yale.

766
00:43:57,701 --> 00:44:00,465
Cheers. Okay, take care.

767
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:09,374
Try this.

768
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:13,340
No.

769
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:28,827
You feel that tingle of the champagne
on your lips?

770
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:33,266
And the smooth and gentle texture
of the body between your teeth?

771
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:40,571
And, finally, the explosive finish
on your tongue?

772
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:13,805
-You know, the shrimp are cold.
-They're supposed to be that way, Mom.

773
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:17,074
I'm not having any of this food.
I'm hungry.

774
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,748
Who in our family eats oysters?

775
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,580
And when did you start eating oysters?

776
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:26,589
God, I mean, you love my cooking.
Why didn't you just run the menu by me?

777
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:29,057
Because all I did was write the check,
Mom.

778
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:32,558
These folk have all the money in the
world and they got you paying for this?

779
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:35,131
-Mom, look at this.
-No, you look at this.

780
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:36,996
Now, this is not you.

781
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:40,133
I know you. You love greens.

782
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:41,967
You will not eat a meal without greens,

783
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:44,803
-and I don't see a green anywhere.
-Mom? Mom.

784
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:47,036
I'll have the chef makes us
our own pot of greens.

785
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:49,372
With neck bones.

786
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:50,606
That stanky chef don't know nothing

787
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:52,241
-about no neck bones.
-Turkey neck bones,

788
00:45:52,245 --> 00:45:55,276
-just like you make 'em.
-Well. Yes, okay.

789
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:01,521
Now, this pool is nothing. I have
a friend who's got a big, big pool.

790
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,389
-It goes way up...
-Mom, come on.

791
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,695
It's true.

792
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:15,832
Hey, everybody, if I could just
get your attention for a second.

793
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:21,139
I wanted to take a moment
to welcome you all to our home

794
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:26,581
and to thank you for sharing
this special occasion with us.

795
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:30,609
Good friends and family,

796
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:35,620
we appreciate how hard it was
to come here without much notice.

797
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:37,626
For that, you can thank Sabrina.

798
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,020
-Yes.
-Baby girl,

799
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:43,897
she is impulsive and spontaneous.

800
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:49,201
She's got a good mind and a huge heart.

801
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:56,210
And I love her.

802
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,871
Thank you, Dad.

803
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:02,484
And now Jason's uncle, Willie Earl,
will be giving the blessing.

804
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:05,221
-Willie Earl. Willie Earl.
-What's happening, Pam?

805
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:09,214
Okay.

806
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:13,488
Heavenly Father, dear Lord,
thank you for these gifts.

807
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:15,555
And thank you for being merciful,

808
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:19,500
even to those
who do not appreciate your generosity.

809
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:23,896
Dear Lord,
they're sitting in their expensive cars,

810
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:25,965
Lord, and they wear their fancy clothes,

811
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:28,637
and they think
that they alone are responsible

812
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:29,804
for everything they have.

813
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,110
-But, Lord, we know the truth, don't we?
-This is not a blessing.

814
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,513
-Hey, baby, just breathe.
-We know that the meek...

815
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:37,619
The meek shall inherit the Earth.
Thank you, Jesus.

816
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:41,688
Hallelujah! Amen! Bon appetit.

817
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,359
-What was that? What was that?
-Just breathe.

818
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,421
Your mother said
that I could give the blessing.

819
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:50,398
Well, if that was a blessing,
you going to hell.

820
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:51,866
That was completely inappropriate.

821
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:55,336
I'm inappropriate?
Where are my people? Where is my family?

822
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:57,303
Well, aren't we all gonna be family
after tomorrow?

823
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:59,341
That's right. After tomorrow, it's on.

824
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:02,640
We're already all one big family, right?

825
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,011
-Baby, let it go. -Yes, and this food
is really hitting the spot.

826
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:08,483
I'll have to work it off tomorrow
with the Electric Slide. Let's have fun.

827
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:12,453
To the left, to the left,
to the right, to the right.

828
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:16,891
Actually, Jason and I told the DJ
not to encourage the slide, you know,

829
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,018
so I don't want you
to look forward to that.

830
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:21,394
Y'all don't do the Electric Slide? What
y'all do, the Riverdance or something?

831
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:25,299
No, Willie Earl. It's just so cliche,
you know.

832
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:27,735
They do it at the end
of every black wedding, and we just...

833
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:30,637
Well, it figures
that your kind would think that way.

834
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:32,538
-Mom.
-Here we go.

835
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:33,769
"Your kind?"

836
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:38,543
I'm sorry, I didn't realize that the
Electric Slide was a cultural necessity.

837
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:42,449
Well, the Electric Slide at a black
wedding is just like jumping the broom.

838
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,350
-Yeah, right.
-You're gonna jump the broom?

839
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,513
No.

840
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,749
-What?
-Namaste.

841
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:48,984
Remember anger management, okay?
Just calm down.

842
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:51,323
Jason, enough is enough.
You've got to jump the broom.

843
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:52,792
-Mom, we just...
-Mrs. Taylor,

844
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:56,992
Jason and I decided we wanted
everything to be simple, elegant.

845
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:00,760
Modern.

846
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:04,432
Would a Jewish couple get married
without breaking the glass?

847
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,632
We're not Jewish.

848
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:06,971
I didn't say you were Jewish.

849
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:10,013
The slaves were not allowed to marry.

850
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,572
Jumping the broom was the only way
that they could show their union.

851
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:16,380
Now, we have done that in this family
for years.

852
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,217
It is a tradition.
It's gone on for generations.

853
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:23,453
And, as you say,
it is a cultural necessity.

854
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:27,358
Look, Harriet Tubman,
Kunta Kinte ain't sitting at the table,

855
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:29,922
and, you know,
this ain't a black history moment, Pam.

856
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:33,394
Well, why should they have to jump
over a broom?

857
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,664
My family weren't slaves.

858
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:36,136
Are you so sure of that?

859
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:38,640
Yes. As a matter of fact,
they owned slaves.

860
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:39,800
What?

861
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:40,968
Mom, don't say that.

862
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:44,010
And you're proud of that?

863
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:47,675
No, no, I'm neither proud nor ashamed.
It's just an immutable fact.

864
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:51,386
You know something,
you're crazier than I thought you were.

865
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:54,424
Here's another fact, honey.
You need to get off your high horse

866
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,823
and come on back down to Earth,
'cause, baby, you black.

867
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:58,190
-That's right.
-Okay? You're black.

868
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,854
-You black.
-No, you don't come into my house

869
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:03,559
and tell me what I'm supposed to do.

870
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,869
I'm about to have this woman dragged
out of my house.

871
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:10,565
No, they're not trying to voulez-vous
coucher avec moi ce soir us.

872
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:14,007
I don't care what they saying in French.
I know she talking about me.

873
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:15,373
Hey, come on, Pam.

874
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:17,538
Mrs. Taylor, it's just that...

875
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:19,204
Did you just kick me
under the table twice?

876
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:21,011
Not in a row, baby. Just relax.

877
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:24,576
Listen, everybody, calm down.
Calm down, calm down, all right?

878
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:30,558
Now, listen, if it is important
to Jason's family to jump the broom,

879
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:35,291
would it be so difficult
to actually consider jumping the broom?

880
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:37,361
-There.
-Thank you.

881
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:43,071
Go play with your whore over there.

882
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:46,670
She said she gonna hit you in the head
with a computer, I heard that.

883
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:50,108
Good evening, good evening,
good evening.

884
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,205
You look awesome this evening.

885
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:53,948
My baby, hi!

886
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:55,416
Can I... Yes.

887
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:57,278
Like we rehearsed.

888
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:00,020
That's a short dress.

889
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:02,791
I'd like to sing a song

890
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:05,987
for Sabrina and Jason's big day.

891
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:13,293
I heard it's been a long,
long six months.

892
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:18,306
I don't know how you two do it.
Wow. I know I couldn't do it.

893
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:23,712
Get up, get up, get up, get up

894
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:28,844
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

895
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:30,214
This is gonna be interesting.

896
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:33,953
Oh, baby, let's get down tonight

897
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:42,689
Ooh, baby

898
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:45,927
I'm hot just like an oven

899
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:47,333
I need some loving

900
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:48,837
No, she didn't say that.

901
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:51,396
And, baby

902
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:53,943
Any chance you might be able to get
that dress after she's done with it?

903
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:56,035
I can't hold on much longer

904
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:59,207
It's getting stronger and stronger

905
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,682
And when I get that feeling

906
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:04,185
I want sexual healing

907
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:08,049
Sexual healing

908
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:10,057
Oh, baby

909
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:13,290
Make me feel so fine

910
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:18,965
Help to relieve my mind

911
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:25,097
Sexual healing, baby, is good for me

912
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:30,477
Sexual healing is something
that's good for me

913
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:34,916
If you don't know
the things that you're dealing

914
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:40,581
Jason and Sabrina,
get some sexual healing

915
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:53,766
I got her sexual healing right here.

916
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:57,432
Hell, she gonna be
the next ex-Miss Willie Taylor.

917
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:07,173
I thought you would at least look
after me once I got here.

918
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,581
How could you let those people
treat me like that?

919
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:11,382
Mom, there is blame to be
had on both sides.

920
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:13,149
Now, will you please
just give these people a break?

921
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:14,713
-Give these people a break?
-Yes.

922
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:18,158
-Her family had slaves and she's proud
of it? -That's not what she said.

923
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:21,162
Now there's something wrong
with my hearing. I know what she said.

924
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:23,791
And you know what, you're gonna end up
being her slave for life.

925
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,095
So, now I'm a slave?

926
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,033
Boy, don't you get dramatic with me.

927
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:30,664
Mom, I have a bachelor party to go to,
all right?

928
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:31,798
Go.

929
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:45,815
Hey, Willie Earl.

930
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:48,715
You on one tonight, ain't you, sis?

931
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,451
That was wrong.

932
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:53,922
And what'd you say that speech for?

933
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:56,591
It's "why did you give that speech."

934
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:59,601
You're out here
with all these bougie folk.

935
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:01,364
You better not be using that Ebonics.

936
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:03,463
No, I'm serious, Pam.

937
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,098
That was wrong and it was foul

938
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:08,170
for going in there and starting that
fight at their dinner table like that.

939
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,975
If Jason don't wanna jump the broom,
he don't have to jump the broom.

940
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:14,505
Willie Earl, the only reason
I brought you up here was to support me.

941
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:17,018
I told my brother
I was gonna help raise his son.

942
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,452
I'm here to support Jason.

943
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:20,784
Well, it really ain't your business.

944
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:25,020
It isn't none of my business.
Remember that? Bougie?

945
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:27,693
Let me tell you something, Pam.

946
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,630
If you keep fighting progress,

947
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,364
you gonna find yourself
on the wrong side of history.

948
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:34,926
-Whatever.
-And that's real talk.

949
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,037
Yeah, it's gonna be whatever.

950
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:40,966
God don't like ugly, Pam.

951
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:44,170
He ain't too fond of cute.

952
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:50,183
I just think the best gift
you can give anyone

953
00:54:50,234 --> 00:54:52,283
on their wedding day is the truth.

954
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:55,017
-Have you completely lost your mind?
-What?

955
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:56,649
You think of no one but yourself.

956
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:58,956
And who are you thinking about,
Claudine?

957
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:00,360
Are you thinking about Sabrina?

958
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,660
Are you thinking about what people
will say behind closed doors?

959
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:04,632
No, I could care less
what people think of me.

960
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:07,092
-Please!
-I am always thinking of Sabrina.

961
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,159
That's clear.

962
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:10,331
I was thinking of Sabrina
when she went to kindergarten

963
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:11,465
and when she went to college.

964
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:14,236
I could write you a whole list
if you need me to, Geneva.

965
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:18,139
You want me to throw you a parade?
Petition you for sainthood?

966
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:22,545
You didn't do me any favors.
You did Mother a favor.

967
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:26,645
I didn't give you Sabrina.
Mother took her from me!

968
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:28,951
Well, what would you have done
with her, Geneva?

969
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:32,958
Pack her in a suitcase every time you
felt like flying off to a new adventure?

970
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:34,360
What, get pregnant again?

971
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:36,125
Well, at least I could get pregnant.

972
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:52,086
If you come anywhere
near my daughter this weekend

973
00:55:52,572 --> 00:55:54,746
with any of your foolishness,

974
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:57,810
you will regret it
for the rest of your life.

975
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,829
Yes, Malcolm,
it was nice to meet you, too.

976
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:09,956
Hold it, hold on.
Okay, don't be too hasty.

977
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,695
I usually
don't talk to dark-skinned girls,

978
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:13,696
but I'm making an exception for you.

979
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:15,499
So, how about we...

980
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,205
-You don't like handcuffs?
-That is not the same thing, Jason.

981
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:25,747
-Rude, ghetto, same thing.
-No, it's not.

982
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:28,044
Look, look, at the end of the day,

983
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,484
I honestly don't care
if we jump the broom or not, Sabrina.

984
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:32,782
You don't care and I don't want to,
so why do it?

985
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:34,380
Because it would make her happy.

986
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:36,652
Look, this woman sacrificed everything
for me.

987
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:37,625
And, quite frankly,

988
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:40,025
if it wasn't for my mother,
I wouldn't be the man you wanna marry.

989
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:41,256
If it wasn't for your mother,

990
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,299
I wouldn't be questioning
if you're the man I wanna marry.

991
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:48,828
So, you're questioning marrying me now
because of my mother?

992
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:52,408
She's disrespecting my family
and she's treating you like a child.

993
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,574
You're letting her
talk to me any kind of way.

994
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:58,278
A husband is supposed to defend
his wife, remember? Leave to cleave?

995
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:01,715
Look, Sabrina,
she's always gonna be my mother.

996
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:04,015
-I know.
-But you are not my wife yet.

997
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:08,648
You're right. I'm not.

998
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:10,955
Which makes it so much easier
to walk away from you, Jason.

999
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:12,654
Look, I didn't... What are you saying?

1000
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,252
I'm saying you're a mama's boy.

1001
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:16,259
Does she know you're out right now?

1002
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:17,697
Do you need to text her?
Do you need to check in?

1003
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:20,759
Do you have a curfew?
Are you allowed to be out past 12:00?

1004
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:23,066
This is ridiculous.

1005
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:28,407
I need a drink.

1006
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:32,471
And not one that's thrown on me, either.
It's a $200 jacket, man.

1007
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,613
-Can I holler at you for a minute?
-Do I have a choice, Malcolm?

1008
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:41,179
Look, I've known you your entire life,
all right?

1009
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:42,849
You messing up.

1010
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:44,484
Your mama mad at you.

1011
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:47,428
From the look of things,
your girl pretty mad at you.

1012
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:51,126
You rushing in, marrying this girl.
You don't know her.

1013
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:53,999
I get it, she's rich, her family's rich.

1014
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:55,731
It's the come-up.

1015
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,466
But do you wanna be one of those guys?

1016
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:00,168
What kind of guys are you talking about?

1017
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:01,767
One of them guys.

1018
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:04,541
The kind of guy that'll do any and
everything to get where they wanna be.

1019
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:07,212
It's all falling apart right
before your eyes. You know why?

1020
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:08,875
You going about it
for the wrong reasons.

1021
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:12,951
That's what this is all about, isn't it?

1022
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:14,046
What?

1023
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:19,220
You're just mad because Ricky
and not you is my best man, right?

1024
00:58:19,295 --> 00:58:20,455
-Nope.
-Tell the truth.

1025
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,966
You know what? Yeah, I'm upset. I am.

1026
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:26,031
I'm your cousin
and I'm your best friend,

1027
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:27,592
but I ain't good enough
to be your best man.

1028
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:29,594
That's what you basically telling me.

1029
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,072
You'd be the best man at my wedding.
Whassup?

1030
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,540
Okay. You wanna talk, let's talk.

1031
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:35,873
Yeah, let's do it. Let's talk.

1032
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:39,078
You are my cousin,
but the whole best friend thing?

1033
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,150
Come on, Malcolm. Who are you fooling?

1034
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,742
We haven't been best friends
for, what, two, three years?

1035
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:46,416
Right around the time I bought my house.

1036
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:48,457
I have a housewarming,
you don't show up.

1037
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,621
I got promoted to vice president.

1038
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:56,025
The entire block shows up.
Eddie, Casual Mike, even Dave comes.

1039
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:58,124
Did you come? No.

1040
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:00,930
Because you don't like hanging
around white people?

1041
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:02,733
Hey, man.
Whenever I'm around white people,

1042
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:05,740
-you know I get arrested.
-This isn't funny, Malcolm.

1043
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:08,504
The only time you don't have something
negative to say about my success

1044
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:10,409
is when you're on the phone
asking me for money.

1045
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:13,008
Exactly.

1046
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:17,416
So, the answer to this big question
you have in your head, no.

1047
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:21,617
Money did not change me. It changed you.

1048
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:26,756
Thanks for the advice,
but, frankly, I don't need it.

1049
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:31,156
You're welcome.

1050
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:37,465
The hell money changed me.
I ain't got none. Explain that.

1051
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:55,180
I've been looking all over for you.

1052
00:59:58,528 --> 00:59:59,859
Here I am.

1053
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:01,862
Thought you said you were coming to bed.

1054
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:07,064
Things change. Don't they?

1055
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:10,898
Yeah.

1056
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:13,598
Yeah, they do.

1057
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:19,438
Claudine?

1058
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,141
You don't have to say it.

1059
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,378
The late nights,
the incessant phone calls.

1060
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:31,952
The way you looked
at that tramp of yours all night long.

1061
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:35,929
You think I'm having an affair?

1062
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:37,966
Please. Let's not do this.

1063
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:40,525
I'm not having an affair, Claudine.

1064
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:43,329
We're broke.

1065
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:45,835
Broke?

1066
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,104
Yes, broke.

1067
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:50,571
This is not the moment for a joke.

1068
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:53,673
Claude, I am not joking.

1069
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:02,753
Oh, my God, Gregg.
How is that even possible?

1070
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:06,185
With the credit freeze,
we didn't have enough cash up-front,

1071
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:08,923
so we had to sell off assets at a loss.

1072
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,960
It's complicated.

1073
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:16,336
Basically, I think we were
a little too aggressive.

1074
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:17,430
We?

1075
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:19,903
We were too aggressive?

1076
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:22,376
All right, I was too aggressive.

1077
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:23,758
You didn't seem
to complain all those years

1078
01:01:23,762 --> 01:01:25,744
you lived off my aggressive investments.

1079
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:29,444
Do not confuse your love for
the finer things in life with my values.

1080
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,282
Unlike you, I could afford them.

1081
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,288
Unlike you, I worked for them!

1082
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:35,521
What exactly is broke?

1083
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,990
Most of our retirement fund's
been wiped out.

1084
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:44,465
We can barely afford this wedding,

1085
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:48,299
let alone the kids' honeymoon.

1086
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:50,697
All we have left

1087
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:56,406
is this house.

1088
01:01:56,946 --> 01:02:00,848
Honestly, Gregory, an affair might
have been easier to swallow.

1089
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:07,422
And just so I'm clear, are you saying
that all my family's money is gone?

1090
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:10,023
That's what I'm saying.

1091
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:14,261
Well, if the sofa
hasn't been repossessed,

1092
01:02:14,328 --> 01:02:17,261
please find yourself on it tonight.

1093
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:28,868
No, absolutely not.
I am not doing this again.

1094
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:31,469
Claude, I'm not playing this game
with you.

1095
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:34,516
I'm gonna have some leftover vichyssoise

1096
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:37,109
and I am gonna pour myself a Scotch.

1097
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,917
Then I'm gonna go up to our bedroom,
get into our bed,

1098
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:44,625
go to sleep, and snore.

1099
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:49,624
Whether you're there or not.

1100
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:12,811
Hey, girl!

1101
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:14,880
This water feels so good.

1102
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:18,927
I haven't been swimming in so long.

1103
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:30,794
You crazy. Get out of that water, girl.

1104
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:34,368
You know, I knew something wasn't right
about this family.

1105
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:37,536
All the money and the big houses
and them weird accents.

1106
01:03:37,613 --> 01:03:39,843
Yeah, but you know what, Pam?
That ain't got nothing to do with it

1107
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:41,645
'cause, you know,
you didn't wanna like 'em from the get.

1108
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,748
Honey, that's because
I can tell a fake a mile away.

1109
01:03:44,854 --> 01:03:46,879
And I'll tell you this.
Now that I know what's going on,

1110
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:49,516
-I don't want Jason mixed up
in this mess. -Okay.

1111
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:53,084
Talking about sending him to China.
Do they even let black folk in China?

1112
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:55,596
You know what, Pam,
I've known Jason his whole life,

1113
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:58,156
and the boy has never been happier,
so leave him alone!

1114
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:02,637
That's exactly my point. He can stay
in the US of A and stay happy.

1115
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:06,503
No. I'll break this wedding up
if I have to,

1116
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:07,873
-I tell you that.
-You know what, Just stop that.

1117
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:08,966
What?

1118
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:12,043
Just 'cause you got that young boy rubbing
on your old ashy legs,

1119
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:13,243
you ain't gotta act out.

1120
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:14,442
Yeah, well, that's one way to go.

1121
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:17,280
And if you had somebody
rubbing up your little ashy leg,

1122
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,787
maybe you would stop
getting into everybody else's business

1123
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,756
because you'd have some of your own.

1124
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:25,760
I tell you this, you about two days
from being a pedophile.

1125
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:28,829
-He is young, ain't he? But he fine.
-Girl.

1126
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:30,763
-Let's brush you.
-How old is that boy anyway?

1127
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:33,563
-Twenty.
-Cougar, cougar, cougar, cougar.

1128
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:35,662
You so crazy.

1129
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:37,764
-Girl, you ought to be ashamed
of yourself. -Hush up.

1130
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:41,606
Don't be mad 'cause you keep trying
to get your man off of a oldman.com.

1131
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:47,405
So, this is what happens
at a bachelor party?

1132
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:49,576
No, this is what happens at a funeral.

1133
01:04:50,019 --> 01:04:52,920
At a bachelor party,
there's a lot of alcohol,

1134
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:57,289
and we drunk by now, with some lady
named Cinnamon Bun dancing on our lap,

1135
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,451
like strippers, like they're bouncing.

1136
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:02,096
Yeah, that's what happens
at a traditional bachelor party.

1137
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:03,256
I don't know what happened here.

1138
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:08,466
-Ready?
-So, you're not angry anymore?

1139
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:10,938
I wanna go and they don't.

1140
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:12,998
I'm not really ready to leave either.

1141
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:14,201
But I wanna go home.

1142
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:15,471
We have a big day tomorrow.

1143
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:18,103
Babe, I'm in the middle
of a conversation right now.

1144
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:21,843
For you to ask me to just walk out
on it, it's kind of rude.

1145
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,647
-Rude?
-I didn't say ghetto.

1146
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:27,354
Hey, hey, hey, guys. It's not that
serious. Jay, we can just call it, man.

1147
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:29,288
I can't believe you're doing this
in front of everybody.

1148
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:31,724
Look, babe, I called my mom,

1149
01:05:31,794 --> 01:05:35,286
and she said I can stay out as late
as I want tonight, so, don't be a brat.

1150
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:37,256
A brat?

1151
01:05:39,035 --> 01:05:40,900
Fine. Have fun with your friends.

1152
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:46,767
Hey! "Brat"?
Come on, man, you from Brooklyn.

1153
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:49,140
"Brat" is the only B word
you could think of right now?

1154
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:51,679
Jay, you don't wanna do this. You know
you're gonna get in some trouble.

1155
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:52,873
Shut up. Look at your shirt.

1156
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:55,748
Look, you did the right thing, Jay.

1157
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:58,150
You're supposed to put your foot down
when women act like that.

1158
01:05:58,521 --> 01:05:59,920
Put 'em in their place, man.

1159
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:03,652
And you are giving the wrong idea
to this young buck right here.

1160
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:07,320
Malcolm. What do you know about a woman?

1161
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:10,089
Now, let's be real.
You know, I don't understand

1162
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:11,963
why y'all are chasing these young girls.

1163
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:15,128
You know, me, myself,
I prefer a more seasoned woman.

1164
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:17,968
Someone with a little experience,
mature.

1165
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,601
You know, you gotta grow up
and leave the childish games behind you.

1166
01:06:21,677 --> 01:06:25,010
Yeah, you're 12, so I don't wanna
hear nothing you got to say.

1167
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:27,015
Okay, first of all,
neither one of you guys understand.

1168
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:28,641
All right,
this man's about to get married.

1169
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:31,744
-"You don't... Neither one
of you guys..." -Jason, forget all this.

1170
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:34,619
You need to go get Sabrina
and squash all this. I'm serious.

1171
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:37,488
Jason, don't listen to nobody
that say words like "squash," all right?

1172
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:40,222
"Squash all this." We don't talk
like that. We from the hood, man.

1173
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:41,762
You don't even know Sabrina.
I know Sabrina.

1174
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:44,095
-And I know Jason.
-Jason, go get your girl, man.

1175
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,599
Jason, get your manhood.

1176
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:51,064
Another round.

1177
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,573
And that's how you do it.

1178
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:54,506
Yes! This is turning
into a bachelor party.

1179
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:57,068
Now you gonna have some fun.
Ladies, please! Ladies!

1180
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:58,204
Not... Not you.

1181
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:00,677
I'd hate to be you in a hour.

1182
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:03,776
Sebastian,
I got this all under control.

1183
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:06,782
Sabrina!

1184
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:11,887
Sabrina!

1185
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:19,631
-God, you taste good.
-So do you.

1186
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:26,371
You wanna taste something good?

1187
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:29,775
It's sweet, but there's a little spice
in it as well.

1188
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:31,472
Sort of like you.

1189
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:34,573
It's good, right?

1190
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:42,383
Burning.

1191
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:44,717
Burning.

1192
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:46,152
Burning, yeah.

1193
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:47,991
No, no, no, it's burning, it's burning.

1194
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:53,997
My sauce.

1195
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:56,002
Oh, my God!

1196
01:07:58,407 --> 01:07:59,499
What the...

1197
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:01,436
Is everybody okay?

1198
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:06,010
I was just making some sauce.

1199
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:08,944
My helper.

1200
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:13,215
Listen, everything's under control.
The alarm should go off in a minute.

1201
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:17,191
This in no way impedes my ability
to do my job.

1202
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:20,620
I want you to know that.
So, as you were.

1203
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:31,063
Babe.

1204
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:33,932
Sabrina. Sabrina.

1205
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:38,311
I mean, I know you ain't
got your private parts out

1206
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:39,711
around all this good food, do you?

1207
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:43,646
And second of all,
do you have any kind of relationship

1208
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:46,085
with some Vaseline lotion or anything?

1209
01:08:46,188 --> 01:08:49,919
Your knees look like you been praying
in some chicken flour.

1210
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:58,393
Sabrina, please, just let me...

1211
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:03,432
Sabrina, let me in.

1212
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:07,033
Come on, open up, Sabrina.
I just wanna talk to you.

1213
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:10,442
Okay, fine, I'll wait

1214
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:14,514
all night, if I have to.

1215
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:57,355
I love you, too.

1216
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:04,028
Jason? Are we getting married too fast?

1217
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:07,596
You're not having second thoughts,
are you, babe?

1218
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:10,638
No, I'm just... I'm asking.

1219
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,407
Did we rush into this because of China?

1220
01:10:14,476 --> 01:10:16,341
Baby, open the door.
I wanna look at you.

1221
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:18,903
I can't. You're not supposed
to see the bride before the wedding.

1222
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:20,508
Right.

1223
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:25,751
No, babe,
we're not rushing into anything.

1224
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:28,405
I knew from the first day we went out

1225
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:30,683
that I'd spend the rest
of my life with you.

1226
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:33,693
You're my heart, Sabrina.

1227
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:37,361
You're my heart, too.

1228
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:42,532
-Jason, let's not do this again, okay?
-All right.

1229
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:44,937
Let's not let other people get in
between the two of us.

1230
01:10:51,513 --> 01:10:52,912
Pinky swear?

1231
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,650
Pinky swear.

1232
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:24,797
Sabrina, get up!

1233
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:27,005
I'm awake.

1234
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:31,975
-Morning.
-Morning.

1235
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:36,611
I wanted to give you this
before everything gets hectic today.

1236
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:38,050
What's this?

1237
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:41,017
This was Grand-Mère's.

1238
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:42,887
And her Grand-Mère's.

1239
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,453
Something old. It's lovely, Mom.
Thank you.

1240
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:47,961
You're welcome.

1241
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:50,021
Thank you for everything.

1242
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:54,166
Sweetheart, we love Jason.

1243
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,331
But are you sure about this?

1244
01:12:58,674 --> 01:13:01,734
How can you ask me that?
Are you trying to ruin my wedding day?

1245
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:02,834
No.

1246
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:04,776
I've never stood in the way
of your dreams,

1247
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:07,247
but what kind of mother would I be
if I didn't ask?

1248
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:09,810
Sabrina, marriage is serious.

1249
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:13,278
It's for life. Are you ready?

1250
01:13:13,355 --> 01:13:14,413
Yes.

1251
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:18,488
Are you and Dad getting a divorce?

1252
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:21,326
Now, why would you ask me that?

1253
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:23,160
"Go play with your whore over there."

1254
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:29,934
I was wrong.
Your father's not having an affair.

1255
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,072
Mom, I see the way
you guys treat each other.

1256
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:37,174
You don't look at each other anymore
when you talk.

1257
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:41,182
-You don't even touch each other.
-We're not getting a divorce.

1258
01:13:42,017 --> 01:13:43,541
The vows say for better or for worse,

1259
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:47,680
and even though we're pretty close,
we're not at our worse.

1260
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:52,222
No matter what, I'm still committed
to your father and I still love him.

1261
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:55,191
-No matter what happens?
-No matter what.

1262
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:58,659
I want that with Jason, Mom.

1263
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:01,359
I want that for you, too.

1264
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:05,868
I'll tell you something that Mabel
told me the day I got married.

1265
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:09,970
Life is like a disco.

1266
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:13,870
No matter how the music changes,
you just keep dancing.

1267
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:18,852
That sounds like Mabel.

1268
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:20,713
Mom.

1269
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:25,155
I can't lie to you. I'm nervous.

1270
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:27,991
Sweetheart.

1271
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:32,523
This is gonna be a great day, right?

1272
01:14:34,503 --> 01:14:35,663
It is.

1273
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:38,539
Jason, you know I love you
and I want the best for you.

1274
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:40,006
I know, Mama, I know.

1275
01:14:40,075 --> 01:14:42,873
Well, what is done in the dark
must come to light.

1276
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:45,607
Mama, Mama, listen. What's wrong?

1277
01:14:46,281 --> 01:14:48,010
You should be happy.
You're one step closer

1278
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:49,516
to getting those grandkids
you've been wanting.

1279
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:52,713
Jason, I need to tell you something
and I feel that now is the...

1280
01:14:52,788 --> 01:14:54,551
Good morning, Pam.

1281
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:57,284
-Jason, you ready?
-I'm ready, I'm ready.

1282
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:59,520
Mama, smile. Okay?

1283
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:03,423
-Smile. Hold that thought!
-Jason, I need to talk to you!

1284
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:13,369
Yes, yes, yes,
I want some of that, that.

1285
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:15,440
Excuse me.

1286
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:18,308
Wait, why do you keep leaving?

1287
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:20,541
'Cause I'm not trying to go to prison.

1288
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:22,211
I see you got jokes.

1289
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:25,586
Boy, do you know I could snap your
little butt

1290
01:15:25,602 --> 01:15:27,287
in two with all these curves?

1291
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:28,950
You promise?

1292
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:30,889
Okay, so now you got jokes.

1293
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:33,689
Look, I may have the body
of a 20-year-old,

1294
01:15:33,762 --> 01:15:37,391
but I have the heart, the mind,
and the soul of a grown man.

1295
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,096
That doesn't change the date
on your birth certificate.

1296
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,972
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.

1297
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:50,109
Help me, Jesus.

1298
01:15:50,646 --> 01:15:52,273
That boy is fine.

1299
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:12,257
If there is any Geneva drama today,
I will unleash a world of hurt.

1300
01:16:31,186 --> 01:16:33,620
What a surprise. You speak French?

1301
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,116
That's Spanish.

1302
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:41,419
Fool.

1303
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:44,789
I'm not a fool.

1304
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:49,336
And I'm not a scientist.
But I do know some things.

1305
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,049
What are you doing way over there?

1306
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:08,146
Hey.

1307
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:13,461
Don't you look sweet enough to eat.

1308
01:17:13,762 --> 01:17:14,854
Wait.

1309
01:17:15,697 --> 01:17:17,028
I'm sorry.

1310
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:20,395
I thought you wanted this.

1311
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:21,993
I did. I did.

1312
01:17:22,571 --> 01:17:25,096
Well, I thought I did. I don't know.

1313
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:27,835
Maybe it's because my best friend
is getting married today, and I'm not.

1314
01:17:28,877 --> 01:17:29,969
You know, it's...

1315
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:32,540
You're not the kind of guy I'm used to.

1316
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,642
What are you still doing here?

1317
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:39,211
I don't know.

1318
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:43,319
But I need to know.

1319
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:47,593
What do you think of me?

1320
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:50,864
What do I think of you?

1321
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:54,458
You're like a pomegranate.

1322
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:57,029
Like a piece of fruit?

1323
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:01,434
You have this hard, protective shell.

1324
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:04,940
You know, the jewelry, the clothes.
The sharp tongue.

1325
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:10,640
But underneath that shell,
you're real sweet. A real beauty inside.

1326
01:18:13,588 --> 01:18:14,680
You see all that?

1327
01:18:14,923 --> 01:18:15,981
Yes, I do.

1328
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:21,194
I'd love to tell you more.

1329
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:23,561
But first,
I have a date with some chicken.

1330
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,097
-Yeah.
-See you later?

1331
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:41,078
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1332
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:52,089
So, you went crawling back
like a little girl.

1333
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,151
Is that what you did?
You had to go back for that money?

1334
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:57,289
Mr. Watson with the ball,
quarterbacking.

1335
01:18:57,365 --> 01:18:59,993
He's got a half-gray,
half-black Jheri curl.

1336
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:02,025
A-one.

1337
01:19:02,104 --> 01:19:03,969
Maybe you should get
two wedding dresses made.

1338
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:05,631
Two girls getting married.

1339
01:19:06,775 --> 01:19:08,140
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1340
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:09,700
Throw the ball, baby!

1341
01:19:09,778 --> 01:19:10,802
What the...

1342
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:12,937
-Hey, man!
-What the hell was that?

1343
01:19:13,014 --> 01:19:14,276
It's touch football, pretty boy.

1344
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:16,380
-You call that touch?
-Yeah, I touched you, didn't I?

1345
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:20,114
Come on, Malcolm, take off that halter
top so we can see your belly ring!

1346
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:22,452
Looking like America's Next Top Model!

1347
01:19:22,557 --> 01:19:24,548
Roses right this way.

1348
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:30,091
Thank you again for doing this
at the 11th hour, Reverend James.

1349
01:19:30,165 --> 01:19:32,156
It means the world to us.

1350
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:35,131
Yes. See you then.

1351
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:36,728
Thank you.

1352
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:39,099
Anything I can do?

1353
01:19:39,174 --> 01:19:40,801
Mrs. Watson,
we have a problem in the kitchen.

1354
01:19:40,876 --> 01:19:42,844
Yes. Stay out of my way.

1355
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:48,242
Really.

1356
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:51,380
It looks beautiful.

1357
01:19:51,753 --> 01:19:53,948
Thank you so much for wearing the dress.

1358
01:19:54,022 --> 01:19:57,549
Here, this is for the wedding.
I hope you like gardenias.

1359
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:01,385
Of course, you don't have to wear it
if you don't want to.

1360
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:08,568
Listen, Mrs. Taylor, I really want to
apologize about last night.

1361
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:10,571
Nobody meant any harm and...

1362
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:13,107
Well, it's your wedding.

1363
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:16,235
It's stressful and I understand.

1364
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:17,945
Thank you.

1365
01:20:18,513 --> 01:20:22,005
And I know you want us
to jump the broom,

1366
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:24,451
but Jason and I
wanna start our own traditions,

1367
01:20:24,567 --> 01:20:26,520
so we're probably not gonna do it.

1368
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:31,726
I'm out of pins.
I'll be right back. Do not move.

1369
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:34,487
Thank you, Mabel. Looks lovely.

1370
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:39,959
So nice to finally meet you
and your family.

1371
01:20:40,035 --> 01:20:43,698
Thank you. Well, I'm gonna go get ready
for the big day.

1372
01:20:44,472 --> 01:20:48,238
Your Aunt Geneva,
I really enjoyed her singing.

1373
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:49,572
She's something else.

1374
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:51,236
Well, that's my auntie.

1375
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:55,181
Yeah, and your mother, she was
pretty upset about her doing that.

1376
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:57,212
What do you mean?

1377
01:20:57,285 --> 01:21:02,416
Well, I saw them later,
last night, arguing.

1378
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:04,185
It was pretty heated.

1379
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:07,118
Well, I'm sure it was no big deal.

1380
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:10,426
I mean, every family
has their issues, so...

1381
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:13,956
You're right.
Every family has their issues.

1382
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:15,332
And secrets.

1383
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:19,106
Sabrina! Sabrina, come quick.
Jason's hurt.

1384
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:22,199
Jason? Wait, don't go!

1385
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:24,973
Jason? Jason, are you okay?

1386
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,713
-Oh, my goodness!
-I'm fine, babe.

1387
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:28,413
Who hurt my baby?

1388
01:21:28,516 --> 01:21:30,279
-What happened?
-Just...

1389
01:21:33,955 --> 01:21:35,684
Who hurt my baby?

1390
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:36,814
He all right.

1391
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:38,325
My fault, Auntie P. He was running.

1392
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:40,418
You know,
he ain't been working out lately.

1393
01:21:40,862 --> 01:21:43,797
Jason. Honey, I'm gonna have
to take you home.

1394
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:46,561
-Home? Where, to Brooklyn?
-Yes, to Brooklyn!

1395
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:49,001
I can call your pediatrician,
Dr. Hunter.

1396
01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:50,828
Pediatrician, are you serious?

1397
01:21:50,972 --> 01:21:53,099
Pam, this grown man
don't need no pediatric...

1398
01:21:53,174 --> 01:21:55,369
Ain't nobody said pediatrician!

1399
01:21:55,443 --> 01:21:57,502
-Mom, I'm fine.
-Yeah, you going overboard.

1400
01:21:57,571 --> 01:21:59,513
Willie Earl,
ain't nobody asked you nothing.

1401
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:02,481
-Okay?
-Come on, let me help you.

1402
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:04,184
Thanks, babe.

1403
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:07,515
Jason, what time is the ferry?

1404
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:09,784
He's gonna be fine. We're just
gonna get him some ice, okay?

1405
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:13,225
Now, you wait just one minute,
Miss Johnny-come-lately.

1406
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:17,856
You haven't known my son over six,
what, seven months?

1407
01:22:18,133 --> 01:22:19,802
And who the hell
you think you are to know

1408
01:22:19,838 --> 01:22:22,763
what's best for him over his mother?

1409
01:22:22,837 --> 01:22:23,895
You know what?

1410
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:27,874
I spent the last two days listening to
you disrespect Jason, me, my family...

1411
01:22:27,976 --> 01:22:31,605
Your family?
You think your family is so perfect?

1412
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,913
Honey, you don't even know
who your parents are.

1413
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:37,678
What are you talking about?

1414
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:40,346
Ask your daddy who your real father is.

1415
01:22:40,422 --> 01:22:43,016
Mrs. Taylor! You are way out of line.

1416
01:22:43,491 --> 01:22:45,482
Dad, I mean, she's crazy.

1417
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:49,988
Dad?

1418
01:22:50,832 --> 01:22:54,063
-What...
-Honey, it's complicated.

1419
01:22:54,169 --> 01:22:56,729
No, it's not complicated.

1420
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:59,296
Either you are or aren't my father.

1421
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:04,937
We should talk to your mother.

1422
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:07,138
Fine, let's go.

1423
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:08,874
Sabrina.

1424
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:10,748
Yeah, go talk to your mama!

1425
01:23:12,087 --> 01:23:12,988
Really, Mom?

1426
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:19,350
Keep chopping. I need that whole bowl.

1427
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:22,590
We are going to have to polish
every one of these glasses, Mabel.

1428
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:26,326
Look at this!

1429
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:29,928
Sabrina's getting married
in three hours, and look at me!

1430
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:34,975
Sorry. Look at you.

1431
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:46,045
Great.

1432
01:23:50,992 --> 01:23:53,722
-What's wrong?
-Is there something you need to tell me?

1433
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:56,757
Tell you? Tell you what?

1434
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,335
-Why are you so upset?
-We should discuss this in private.

1435
01:24:01,436 --> 01:24:02,903
No, Dad, there's no more private here.

1436
01:24:03,571 --> 01:24:05,061
Somebody's gonna tell me the truth.

1437
01:24:05,673 --> 01:24:06,833
Mom?

1438
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:11,670
Mom, tell me that this lady's crazy
and that she's making this up.

1439
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:15,242
Tell me the truth.
Are you two my parents?

1440
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:29,359
Sabrina, honey, listen.

1441
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:34,562
I was 16.

1442
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:39,097
Honey, your parents were... Honey,
they were already married, you know?

1443
01:24:39,174 --> 01:24:41,904
It just made sense for them to take you.

1444
01:24:44,846 --> 01:24:46,074
Sweetheart.

1445
01:24:46,881 --> 01:24:49,873
From the moment I saw you,
you were mine.

1446
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:53,644
And every moment that we spent together,
you became a part of me.

1447
01:24:53,788 --> 01:24:56,416
-I didn't wanna lose you.
-No, don't...

1448
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:19,208
Happy now?

1449
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:23,914
-The wedding's off.
-What?

1450
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,785
You let this happen.

1451
01:25:26,721 --> 01:25:28,052
Sabrina...

1452
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:32,290
Sabrina, hold on!

1453
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:38,992
Sabrina, wait, let's talk about this!

1454
01:25:39,067 --> 01:25:42,002
Sabrina, wait! I'm gonna take care
of this! Come on, baby, please! Talk...

1455
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:44,470
Sabrina! Sabrina!

1456
01:26:20,441 --> 01:26:22,568
-What was that?
-It was the truth.

1457
01:26:22,644 --> 01:26:23,601
I prayed on it.

1458
01:26:23,659 --> 01:26:26,444
-Somebody had to tell her.
-You prayed on it.

1459
01:26:26,514 --> 01:26:28,641
And God told you to do this?

1460
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:31,677
To destroy a family
and ruin Sabrina's life?

1461
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:33,118
I was protecting you!

1462
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:35,918
Protecting me from what, Mom?
I'm not a 10-year-old boy anymore!

1463
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:37,981
-That's still your mama, now...
-I got this!

1464
01:26:38,059 --> 01:26:41,324
No, no, no, no, you watch your tone.
You realize who you're talking to.

1465
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:43,990
Mom, what is it that you want from me?

1466
01:26:44,065 --> 01:26:46,590
You want love? I'll give it to you.

1467
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:49,569
-You want respect? I give you that, too.
-Respect?

1468
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:51,730
Well, you haven't given me very much
of that this weekend.

1469
01:26:51,806 --> 01:26:56,004
How? Because the shrimp was cold
or your pies didn't make it on the menu?

1470
01:26:56,077 --> 01:26:58,341
Or because Sabrina
just doesn't wanna jump the broom?

1471
01:26:58,446 --> 01:26:59,936
It's her wedding, not yours.

1472
01:27:00,014 --> 01:27:02,812
Listen, you and that little girl
have been dating for six months.

1473
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:04,909
She thinks she's too good
to come across the bridge,

1474
01:27:04,986 --> 01:27:07,853
-say hello to me?
-No, she doesn't. No, she doesn't.

1475
01:27:07,922 --> 01:27:09,116
I wouldn't let her.

1476
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:13,224
-You?
-Yes.

1477
01:27:13,294 --> 01:27:14,784
Can you understand why now?

1478
01:27:15,096 --> 01:27:16,290
Look at what you've done.

1479
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:21,262
Mom, every single woman
that I've let in my life,

1480
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:25,234
you've driven 'em away
with your manipulations.

1481
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:29,438
And I actually thought
Sabrina would be a little different.

1482
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:31,705
But, no. You win.

1483
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:34,045
-Jason...
-No, Mom, no.

1484
01:27:35,483 --> 01:27:40,511
You treat me like I'm either
a little boy or your husband.

1485
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:42,488
And I'm neither.

1486
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:44,889
I am a man and I am your son.

1487
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:48,956
And I promised you
that I will always be here for you.

1488
01:27:50,298 --> 01:27:51,765
And that hasn't changed.

1489
01:27:53,101 --> 01:27:54,090
That hasn't.

1490
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:59,304
But you have got to change.

1491
01:28:01,843 --> 01:28:03,276
You've got to change, Mom.

1492
01:28:16,224 --> 01:28:17,555
Excuse me.

1493
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:20,386
Show's over.

1494
01:28:21,496 --> 01:28:22,724
Go about your business.

1495
01:29:11,112 --> 01:29:12,545
What was that?

1496
01:29:12,613 --> 01:29:14,638
-I didn't mean to say it.
-Yes, you did.

1497
01:29:14,716 --> 01:29:18,083
-I did not! It just slipped out!
-It slipped out?

1498
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:19,744
You know you've been trying
to break up this marriage

1499
01:29:19,821 --> 01:29:21,220
ever since the beginning, you know that?

1500
01:29:21,322 --> 01:29:22,987
I feel terrible about this!

1501
01:29:22,995 --> 01:29:25,383
You ought to feel terrible
about this, Pam!

1502
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:27,851
You know, it's real funny
how people like to apologize

1503
01:29:27,896 --> 01:29:29,289
after they do something bad.

1504
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:30,763
It's real funny.

1505
01:29:30,998 --> 01:29:33,762
I see you sitting there
with your Bible. You praying.

1506
01:29:33,835 --> 01:29:35,598
Trying to make up with God?

1507
01:29:36,637 --> 01:29:38,468
If you wanna pray on something, Pam,

1508
01:29:39,107 --> 01:29:41,337
you better pray
that Jason get that girl back.

1509
01:29:41,642 --> 01:29:42,973
Pray on that.

1510
01:29:44,112 --> 01:29:45,807
And fix your wig on your head.

1511
01:29:51,352 --> 01:29:54,446
Sabrina, it's me.
Please tell us where you are.

1512
01:29:55,523 --> 01:29:59,425
We got your back, girl.
Just call, tell us what to do. Sabrina.

1513
01:29:59,494 --> 01:30:01,553
Ricky, I'm gonna go to the cliffs,
if you could go to the swings.

1514
01:30:01,662 --> 01:30:03,789
-And, Sebastian, you check State Beach.
-Got it.

1515
01:30:03,865 --> 01:30:05,093
Jason, where should we look?

1516
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:09,195
Thank you, Shonda.

1517
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:11,065
She could come with me.

1518
01:30:11,139 --> 01:30:14,438
Sebastian, didn't I tell you
that I wasn't trying to go to prison?

1519
01:30:14,509 --> 01:30:17,273
Look, woman,
this isn't about you and me.

1520
01:30:17,345 --> 01:30:21,042
This is about Jason and Sabrina, so
get in the car and help me find Sabrina.

1521
01:30:22,483 --> 01:30:23,472
Well, all right.

1522
01:30:23,551 --> 01:30:25,246
Look here. You chasing now?

1523
01:30:25,453 --> 01:30:27,387
Sell out your whole family
for this uppity chick?

1524
01:30:27,455 --> 01:30:29,082
This is not the time for this.

1525
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:31,921
What's the rush?
Ain't nobody the best man now.

1526
01:31:20,074 --> 01:31:21,439
The guests will be arriving in an hour.

1527
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:24,405
Should we start making the calls?

1528
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:27,004
No. Not yet.

1529
01:31:44,866 --> 01:31:46,663
You know, when Daddy died,

1530
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:50,436
I felt alone.

1531
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:56,476
Like anything that went wrong,
it was up to me to fix.

1532
01:32:01,582 --> 01:32:03,015
Well, I can't fix this.

1533
01:32:07,755 --> 01:32:08,813
I need you.

1534
01:32:12,059 --> 01:32:13,754
I need your help, God.

1535
01:32:18,065 --> 01:32:20,363
All I ask is
that you bring her back to me.

1536
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:27,607
That's all I ask.

1537
01:32:40,288 --> 01:32:41,516
Sabrina?

1538
01:32:47,495 --> 01:32:48,519
Thank you for calling me.

1539
01:32:50,631 --> 01:32:51,928
Don't thank me just yet.

1540
01:32:56,203 --> 01:32:58,763
I know you just think
we're just all horrible.

1541
01:32:59,874 --> 01:33:02,968
And this may sound crazy,

1542
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:06,945
but, chérie,
we didn't tell you because we love you.

1543
01:33:07,014 --> 01:33:08,777
It does sound crazy.

1544
01:33:11,352 --> 01:33:12,785
How could you lie to me?

1545
01:33:16,557 --> 01:33:19,651
What kind of woman just leaves her child
for someone else to raise?

1546
01:33:19,794 --> 01:33:21,853
I wasn't a woman.

1547
01:33:21,929 --> 01:33:23,419
I was a child.

1548
01:33:24,832 --> 01:33:26,857
Your Grand-Mère knew that.

1549
01:33:30,905 --> 01:33:33,567
But look at you, Sabrina.
You are beautiful.

1550
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:38,042
God, you're smart. You're everything
I would've ever wanted you to be.

1551
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:42,109
But I wouldn't have been able to
give you what Claudine gave you.

1552
01:33:43,851 --> 01:33:46,285
And I gave her hell about it, too.

1553
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:52,888
And what about my father?

1554
01:33:58,566 --> 01:34:02,366
I took this summer trip to France

1555
01:34:04,538 --> 01:34:06,836
and I met this gorgeous man.

1556
01:34:08,376 --> 01:34:10,708
We spent two weeks together

1557
01:34:10,778 --> 01:34:13,872
and we fell deliriously in love.

1558
01:34:14,582 --> 01:34:16,641
I mean, we planned to travel the world.

1559
01:34:18,919 --> 01:34:21,046
And then he told me
about his wife and kids.

1560
01:34:25,593 --> 01:34:31,862
I returned to the States
unmarried and pregnant.

1561
01:34:33,601 --> 01:34:35,501
So, they just cleaned up your mess.

1562
01:34:37,705 --> 01:34:39,070
Mom and Dad,

1563
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:42,300
they just took me.

1564
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:44,300
Is that what you're saying?

1565
01:34:45,913 --> 01:34:46,971
Yes.

1566
01:34:48,149 --> 01:34:49,207
Yes.

1567
01:34:49,984 --> 01:34:55,047
Sabrina, having you
was the greatest achievement of my life.

1568
01:34:56,991 --> 01:34:59,824
And not caring for you every day
was my greatest failure.

1569
01:35:01,962 --> 01:35:03,930
Don't let all this keep you
from your blessing.

1570
01:35:05,466 --> 01:35:08,902
You have a good man

1571
01:35:10,037 --> 01:35:12,028
who's looking for you.

1572
01:35:44,472 --> 01:35:45,996
You okay, baby?

1573
01:35:47,608 --> 01:35:49,940
I am so sorry.

1574
01:35:54,682 --> 01:35:55,876
You were right.

1575
01:35:57,017 --> 01:35:58,848
And I promise you
this will never happen again.

1576
01:35:58,919 --> 01:36:00,784
I spoke to my mom.
And if you just, please,

1577
01:36:00,855 --> 01:36:01,715
just give me another chance,

1578
01:36:01,716 --> 01:36:04,382
-I promise...
-Jason, no. I can't.

1579
01:36:05,493 --> 01:36:06,755
We can't.

1580
01:36:07,428 --> 01:36:09,487
Your mother ruined our wedding.

1581
01:36:10,898 --> 01:36:12,229
You're not the man I thought you were.

1582
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:14,257
-Baby.
-And you didn't protect me,

1583
01:36:14,335 --> 01:36:15,461
-you didn't defend me.
-Sabrina...

1584
01:36:15,536 --> 01:36:17,697
Everything has changed.
My life has changed!

1585
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:18,761
Sabrina?

1586
01:36:19,907 --> 01:36:20,896
Breathe.

1587
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:24,539
Just breathe, baby.

1588
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:30,578
Jason,

1589
01:36:32,586 --> 01:36:33,575
it's too messy now.

1590
01:36:35,122 --> 01:36:36,555
I don't know who I am.

1591
01:36:37,658 --> 01:36:39,091
How can I marry you?

1592
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:45,361
Sabrina, you remember when you told me
that details are what make the person?

1593
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:48,327
Well, here are some details.

1594
01:36:49,069 --> 01:36:50,832
Sabrina, you're an optimist.

1595
01:36:51,405 --> 01:36:54,033
Whenever anyone's having a bad day,
all you have to do is smile

1596
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:55,165
and you bring them right back up.

1597
01:36:56,343 --> 01:36:58,641
And you taught me the value
of protecting our love.

1598
01:36:58,712 --> 01:37:00,009
And I know it was hard for you,

1599
01:37:01,549 --> 01:37:03,016
but you kept your vow to God.

1600
01:37:05,586 --> 01:37:08,180
Baby, that's who I fell in love with.

1601
01:37:08,956 --> 01:37:10,685
That's who you are.

1602
01:37:11,559 --> 01:37:13,220
That's who I love.

1603
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:18,522
And, yeah, I know it's a mess,
but you know what, baby?

1604
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:20,823
It's our mess.

1605
01:37:22,136 --> 01:37:23,228
Ours.

1606
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:28,232
You left out one important detail.

1607
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:29,942
What, babe?

1608
01:37:30,244 --> 01:37:31,609
I love you.

1609
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:44,782
I love you, too.

1610
01:37:49,230 --> 01:37:50,322
Okay.

1611
01:37:50,998 --> 01:37:53,228
Will you please never
take this off again?

1612
01:37:54,068 --> 01:37:55,467
Pinky swear.

1613
01:38:03,177 --> 01:38:04,838
I hope our honeymoon's better than this.

1614
01:38:04,912 --> 01:38:06,573
I promise you.

1615
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:38,572
Dear Sabrina, I'm sorry.

1616
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:42,706
I feel sick
about how I behaved this weekend.

1617
01:38:42,783 --> 01:38:45,343
I was afraid of being alone.

1618
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:49,089
I want you to have this broom
because it means more to me

1619
01:38:49,156 --> 01:38:52,091
than almost anything else in the world,

1620
01:38:52,526 --> 01:38:56,622
and I pray you and Jason
have a long and happy life together.

1621
01:38:57,865 --> 01:38:58,854
Pam.

1622
01:39:01,435 --> 01:39:03,096
Lord, give me strength.

1623
01:39:13,714 --> 01:39:14,942
Sabrina?

1624
01:39:16,283 --> 01:39:17,978
She's on the run again!

1625
01:39:18,052 --> 01:39:19,713
-What now? Please.
-Sabrina!

1626
01:39:21,055 --> 01:39:23,046
-Sabrina!
-Wait, wait!

1627
01:39:23,123 --> 01:39:24,920
-Where is she going?
-Wait!

1628
01:39:26,961 --> 01:39:28,519
Mrs. Taylor!

1629
01:39:31,065 --> 01:39:32,191
Sabrina?

1630
01:39:32,833 --> 01:39:33,822
Don't go, don't go!

1631
01:39:33,901 --> 01:39:35,528
-My goodness!
-Got your note.

1632
01:39:35,602 --> 01:39:37,035
Jason and I need you to be here, okay?

1633
01:39:37,104 --> 01:39:39,800
-Honey.
-All right? Come on.

1634
01:39:39,873 --> 01:39:41,841
Don't be silly now.

1635
01:39:41,942 --> 01:39:45,241
-Look at you! You look beautiful.
-Yeah?

1636
01:39:46,914 --> 01:39:48,711
-I wanna be here, too.
-Good.

1637
01:39:48,782 --> 01:39:50,647
-Here, let me get your gown.
-Thank you.

1638
01:39:50,718 --> 01:39:53,050
Sir, bring my bags! Bring my bags!

1639
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:54,348
Come on.

1640
01:41:05,092 --> 01:41:07,686
-Love you, sweetie.
-I love you, too.

1641
01:41:09,663 --> 01:41:10,823
Jason.

1642
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:20,729
Please be seated.

1643
01:41:24,078 --> 01:41:27,241
Who giveth this woman
to be married to this man?

1644
01:41:45,466 --> 01:41:46,490
-We do.
-We do.

1645
01:41:49,002 --> 01:41:50,060
Sabrina,

1646
01:41:51,338 --> 01:41:52,458
you've given me the clarity,

1647
01:41:52,607 --> 01:41:55,468
the strength,
and the wisdom to be a better man.

1648
01:41:57,344 --> 01:42:02,111
Jason, you make me happier
than anyone ever has.

1649
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:06,681
I don't wanna live life unless you're
in it. You're my man.

1650
01:42:07,187 --> 01:42:08,779
-I love you.
-I love you.

1651
01:42:11,024 --> 01:42:13,288
Sabrina, Jason,

1652
01:42:14,394 --> 01:42:20,526
by the powers invested in me,
I pronounce you husband and wife.

1653
01:42:21,335 --> 01:42:22,563
You may salute your bride.

1654
01:42:22,736 --> 01:42:23,964
Come on.

1655
01:42:41,788 --> 01:42:43,517
I taught him how to kiss,
you know what I'm saying.

1656
01:42:43,590 --> 01:42:44,579
Ladies and gentlemen...

1657
01:42:46,226 --> 01:42:50,595
Ladies and gentlemen, brothers
and sisters, may I present to you...

1658
01:42:50,664 --> 01:42:51,653
Wait, I'm sorry.

1659
01:42:52,566 --> 01:42:54,090
Amy, come here.

1660
01:42:59,907 --> 01:43:00,896
There.

1661
01:43:06,847 --> 01:43:07,836
Thank you.

1662
01:43:09,716 --> 01:43:13,345
Ladies and gentlemen,
brothers and sisters, I present to you

1663
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:16,856
Mr, and Mrs. Jason Edgar Taylor.

1664
01:43:54,461 --> 01:43:56,429
So, are you on Facebook?

1665
01:43:57,431 --> 01:43:58,455
No.

1666
01:43:58,999 --> 01:44:00,296
-Twitter?
-Nope.

1667
01:44:00,934 --> 01:44:02,868
Can I at least text you?

1668
01:44:02,936 --> 01:44:05,063
Sebastian, you're such a great guy,

1669
01:44:05,138 --> 01:44:08,301
but we're just in two different places
in our lives, and...

1670
01:44:17,985 --> 01:44:21,255
It's ShondaPeterkin@gmail.com.

1671
01:44:21,989 --> 01:44:23,320
Did Sebastian just...

1672
01:44:23,390 --> 01:44:25,984
Not your business, not your business.

1673
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:34,628
You know, not a lot of men would've
raised someone else's daughter.

1674
01:44:35,836 --> 01:44:39,203
Not a lot of men
were lucky enough to marry you.

1675
01:44:40,807 --> 01:44:42,206
You still feel lucky?

1676
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,648
You know I feel lucky.

1677
01:44:52,452 --> 01:44:54,784
This feels like the last hurrah.

1678
01:44:57,224 --> 01:45:00,455
So, we'll go to China on miles.

1679
01:45:01,828 --> 01:45:04,319
I am gonna miss the Four Seasons.

1680
01:45:04,998 --> 01:45:09,196
Well, I do have a rainy-day fund
for special occasions.

1681
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:11,965
You kept it hidden from me?

1682
01:45:12,572 --> 01:45:14,665
Not all secrets are bad.

1683
01:45:15,108 --> 01:45:16,268
You

1684
01:45:17,377 --> 01:45:18,844
are smart.

1685
01:45:21,448 --> 01:45:22,938
And beautiful.

1686
01:45:39,132 --> 01:45:40,599
So, how much?

1687
01:45:41,134 --> 01:45:43,159
Wouldn't you like to know?

1688
01:45:43,570 --> 01:45:46,767
Yeah, I would. Maybe I'll invest it.

1689
01:45:50,177 --> 01:45:52,304
Excuse me! Hear ye, hear ye!

1690
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:56,405
I'd like everybody's attention.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1691
01:45:56,483 --> 01:45:59,646
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to say one thing.

1692
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:02,820
I'd like to send a congratulations out

1693
01:46:02,889 --> 01:46:05,687
to the bride and groom,
the beautiful Miss Sabrina.
