1
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,333
Cobra Two, Cobra One. It's showtime.

2
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,959
West quadrant secure.
Whitey Two moving in east quadrant.

3
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,969
Here we go.

4
00:01:16,364 --> 00:01:18,322
<i>Some people will work</i>

5
00:01:20,243 --> 00:01:22,531
<i>Some simply will die</i>

6
00:01:23,745 --> 00:01:29,748
<i>But they'll complain and complain
and complain and complain and complain</i>

7
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:34,085
<i>Some people must have</i>

8
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,248
<i>Some never will...</i>

9
00:01:38,425 --> 00:01:42,042
<i>- [man] Bob Roberts is a stalwart American.
- [Man] Bob's a champion swordsman.</i>

10
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,055
<i>- [Man] A tireless worker.
- [Man] Bob's a man of vision.</i>

11
00:01:45,223 --> 00:01:48,425
<i>- [Man] Dynamic personality.
- [Man] He's a unique individual.</i>

12
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:51,852
<i>- [Man] Bob is prime-cut, Grade A.
- [Woman] He's a genius.</i>

13
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:55,388
<i>- [Man] He's a man of the people.
- [Woman] I love Bob Roberts.</i>

14
00:01:55,564 --> 00:01:59,348
<i>- [Man] He's a mover and a shaker.
- {woman] The leader of a generation.</i>

15
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:04,152
<i>[Man] A young man with a guitar starts
singing, right in the middle of the restaurant.</i>

16
00:02:04,322 --> 00:02:07,075
This is happening in Brophy's.

17
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:11,487
He not only had a brilliant mind
and wonderful wit, but could also sing.

18
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:16,738
He finishes the song, tremendous applause,
then out the door, he's gone.

19
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:20,331
I look at Mr Hart and I say, "What was that?"

20
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:25,744
And he says in his own inimitable way,
"That, my friend, was a gold-mine. "

21
00:02:25,923 --> 00:02:28,211
<i>- And then?
- And then it happened.</i>

22
00:02:28,383 --> 00:02:32,595
<i>- He became a star overnight.
- That is correct.</i>

23
00:02:32,763 --> 00:02:37,222
<i>He has a tremendous talent.
An artist in the true sense of the word.</i>

24
00:02:37,393 --> 00:02:39,930
<i>And the next senator from Pennsylvania.</i>

25
00:02:40,102 --> 00:02:42,427
Seize the day!

26
00:02:42,604 --> 00:02:44,595
<i>[Bob]... I spend all my time drunk in a bar</i>

27
00:02:44,772 --> 00:02:49,233
<i>I want to be rich, I don't have a brain
So give me a handout while I complain</i>

28
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,021
Bob Roberts, fencing enthusiast,

29
00:02:52,196 --> 00:02:55,399
poet, folk singer, businessman,

30
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:57,400
senatorial candidate.

31
00:02:57,574 --> 00:03:01,702
This controversial
yet extraordinarily popular entertainer

32
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:04,276
appeared on the music scene three years ago

33
00:03:04,456 --> 00:03:07,824
<i>with his debut album
The Freewheelin' Bob Roberts.</i>

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,670
Despite being assailed by the music critics

35
00:03:10,835 --> 00:03:14,998
as a corrupt, unfair diatribe against the '60s,

36
00:03:15,173 --> 00:03:20,332
the album remarkably soared to number 23
on the Billboard charts.

37
00:03:20,511 --> 00:03:23,547
- [Clapping]
- [Terry] Backed by a team of novices,

38
00:03:23,722 --> 00:03:27,850
without the support of a major record label,
relying on word of mouth

39
00:03:28,018 --> 00:03:33,852
and his team of associates who seem
more suited to a town house than a tour bus,

40
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:39,148
Roberts created a niche in a business
that had contemptuously rejected him.

41
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:44,144
<i>His second album, Times Are Changin' Back,
peaks at number three, an achievement</i>

42
00:03:44,322 --> 00:03:50,358
<i>for a journeyman folk singer that Spin
magazine called "a crypto-fascist clown".</i>

43
00:03:50,535 --> 00:03:53,324
- You have the wrong pass.
- I don't see the problem.

44
00:03:53,496 --> 00:03:56,034
You need to go to the police and get a pass.

45
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,618
<i>[Terry] On July 4th,</i>

46
00:03:57,792 --> 00:04:01,955
<i>Bob Roberts announced his candidacy
for the Senate seat in Pennsylvania.</i>

47
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:06,292
<i>This documentary chronicles the man
and his quest for election.</i>

48
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:10,083
<i>[Bob] Eight years ago, I had had enough.</i>

49
00:04:10,262 --> 00:04:14,008
I had seen the dreams of a generation
squashed by an evil menace,

50
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,182
an evil menace called drugs.

51
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,765
I made up my mind there and then
to dedicate my life

52
00:04:20,936 --> 00:04:25,978
to seeing that this problem end in our lifetime.

53
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,439
I contacted my friend Lukas Hart
and I enlisted his help.

54
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:34,319
It is because of Lukas Hart's
diligence and efforts

55
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,940
that eight years ago Broken Dove was born.

56
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:44,202
<i>[Bob] Broken Dove is hard at work fighting
the war on drugs but it will take time.</i>

57
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:47,374
<i>We must start the war early,
ladies and gentleman.</i>

58
00:04:47,543 --> 00:04:51,125
<i>We must start the war
with our children at home</i>

59
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:54,747
<i>- and in our classrooms.
- [Skip To My Lou]</i>

60
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:57,249
Hey, mister, can I see your gun?

61
00:04:57,426 --> 00:05:01,468
- Can I see your gun?
- What makes you think I have a gun?

62
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:08,888
Come on over this way.
Get some great shots with the kids.

63
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:11,267
- [Child shouting]
- You got me!

64
00:05:11,438 --> 00:05:14,009
You got me. Good work, kids. I'm dead.

65
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:18,855
Here's Mrs Roberts. Here's Mrs Roberts. Polly.

66
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:23,191
Polly and Bob.
Let's take a picture with the kids.

67
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:26,033
Sit right there on the table.

68
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:30,203
<i>[Doctor] Bob is a tireless worker.
Unbridled energy.</i>

69
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,405
<i>As his doctor,
I tell him to slow down. He won't.</i>

70
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:37,957
Without his organisation Broken Dove,
this clinic would not exist.

71
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:40,499
[Aide] I want you all to say, "Vote Bob".

72
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,545
Vote Bob!

73
00:05:42,713 --> 00:05:47,504
<i>What did the teacher tell you
in school today, in school today?</i>

74
00:05:47,676 --> 00:05:53,133
<i>What did the teacher tell you
in school today, my child?</i>

75
00:05:53,306 --> 00:05:57,884
<i>He said it's a crime to say a little prayer</i>

76
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:03,764
<i>He said God's no longer wanted here</i>

77
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,317
<i>Oh, that's what the silly teacher
told you in school</i>

78
00:06:08,485 --> 00:06:12,731
Robert Roberts Junior was born
on January 3rd, 1955

79
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,444
in St Vincent's Hospital, Philadelphia.

80
00:06:15,617 --> 00:06:19,484
In his early years, Bob lives on a commune
in rural Pennsylvania.

81
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:21,903
It was an idealistic attempt.

82
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,080
This was the late '50s, pre-hippie.

83
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,791
We tried to establish a community based
on the idea of collective responsibility.

84
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:32,879
It's a crazy idea. It was nuts.

85
00:06:33,047 --> 00:06:36,997
It was an unrealistic environment
for a child to grow up in.

86
00:06:37,177 --> 00:06:40,958
We moved to Philadelphia
when Bobby was three.

87
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:46,213
It'll be cold today. Chilly, chilly as the leaves
of autumn make way for the wind of winter.

88
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:51,094
Early snow was reported in some mountain
regions but don't dust off the skis yet, folks.

89
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,686
Here in Philly it's a brisk 43.

90
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:58,357
Now, Kelly Noble interiews
senatorial candidate Bob Roberts.

91
00:06:58,527 --> 00:07:02,903
I must say that I'm not a fan of your music.
I find it offensive.

92
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:06,856
I wouldn't vote for you
if my life depended on it.

93
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:11,364
Good morning, Philadelphia.
Our guest today is Bob Roberts,

94
00:07:11,538 --> 00:07:14,455
Pennsylvania senatorial candidate
and folk singer.

95
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:18,870
Our viewers are curious about where it began.
Where did it start for you?

96
00:07:19,044 --> 00:07:20,373
Where did what start?

97
00:07:20,546 --> 00:07:23,380
Was it a small colonial home

98
00:07:23,549 --> 00:07:27,878
with a mom in a starched dress
and a dad in a seersucker suit?

99
00:07:28,052 --> 00:07:30,425
- You're speaking of my upbringing?
- Yes.

100
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:34,758
I came to speak about the issues
but I will indulge your personality search.

101
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:37,685
I was born and raised lower middle-class

102
00:07:37,852 --> 00:07:41,303
right outside the city of brotherly love,
Philadelphia.

103
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,603
My father was a fry cook, my mother
a peacenik. I had no brothers or sisters.

104
00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:48,814
Make your judgements if you must.

105
00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:51,109
He was a model student.

106
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,147
So full of life and energy.

107
00:07:55,325 --> 00:08:00,663
Some of the other kids didn't like him
very much. But I did. Very much.

108
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,827
Increasing restlessness and trouble
with authority figures and classmates

109
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,708
create problems for Bob in high school,
and by his senior year his grades have fallen.

110
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:15,252
[Bob] I know what it's like to be without
a home. I was homeless when I was 17.

111
00:08:15,426 --> 00:08:19,504
I didn't ramble, I didn't roam.
No boxcars or park benches.

112
00:08:19,678 --> 00:08:21,965
No panhandling for me.

113
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:26,136
I went straight to work,
earned enough money on my own

114
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:30,223
to enrol myself in a school of my choice,
a school I wanted.

115
00:08:30,396 --> 00:08:34,772
That's not quite true.
Bobby enrolled himself in military college

116
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:37,432
by forging my signature on a cheque of mine.

117
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:43,032
[Father] He was happy there. He said
he needed discipline, more structure in his life.

118
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:45,735
He felt we offered too much freedom.

119
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:48,909
And do you know what? He was right.

120
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:54,416
I was trying to instil different values in him
than the ones he has now.

121
00:08:54,582 --> 00:08:56,290
Let's just leave it at that.

122
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,538
The '60s are, let's face it,
a dark stain on American history.

123
00:09:00,713 --> 00:09:04,626
At no other time has lawlessness
and immorality been so widespread.

124
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,548
You're speaking of Watergate
and our invasion of Cambodia.

125
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:12,634
No. No, I'm not. I see. I'm speaking of you,

126
00:09:12,806 --> 00:09:16,556
of lawlessness and immorality
with regard to drug use and sexual practice.

127
00:09:16,726 --> 00:09:19,263
- Excuse me?
- Disregard in the press

128
00:09:19,437 --> 00:09:23,269
for the sacred institutions that have
made this country what it is today.

129
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,438
Is social protest disregard
for our laws and institutions?

130
00:09:27,611 --> 00:09:31,111
- Certainly it is.
- It is a guaranteed right in our constitution.

131
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:35,063
- So is burning the flag. Need I say more?
- You need say more.

132
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:41,361
Or are we to believe that Bob Roberts
wants to see a compliant and silent public

133
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:45,916
which respects the actions of its presidents,
no matter how immoral or illegal?

134
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,709
- Are you a communist?
- Excuse me?

135
00:09:47,877 --> 00:09:49,917
Self-determination.

136
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:53,421
The choice to be what you want to be.

137
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,922
And I wanted to be... rich.

138
00:09:57,094 --> 00:09:59,549
[Laughter]

139

I take offence at that, deeply.

I'm an American that believes
intensely in morality

00:11:00,648 --> 00:11:03,434
and in the sanctity of the office
of the presidency.

151
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:07,984
I trust that the American public does not share
your cynical anti-American views

152
00:11:08,153 --> 00:11:11,357
and will cast their votes accordingly,
with pride and conviction.

It means you want Americans to cast
their votes based on hatred and ignorance.

155
00:11:19,914 --> 00:11:23,033
You're taking sides, ma'am. You're abusing
your responsibility as a journalist.

I am offended by you, sir. If I ignore
my feelings, I'm taking your side.

Isn't your job one of objectivity?

Hey, brother. Does getting in on the ground
floor mean checking your skin at the door?

- Black people can have another opinion.
- You're still black?

I think so. We don't have to adhere

Bob Roberts is from that faction that lives to
destroy whatever good came out of the '60s,

171
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,331
to rewrite the history of that important period,

172
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:27,011
a period where the American people
actually were informed and aware

173
00:12:27,178 --> 00:12:29,750
and realised that they had a voice.

174
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:33,763
They demanded that a war end.

Bob Roberts is Nixon, only he's shrewder.
More complicated, this Bob Roberts.

[Bob] Now is the time to invest. We mustn't
be intimidated by Third World madmen.

307
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:39,746
We must stay strong and market confident.
Reluctance feeds the aggressor.

308
00:20:39,926 --> 00:20:42,926
As we say, if you're afraid of an act of market...

309
00:20:43,094 --> 00:20:45,132
[all shout] You're a dead man!

310
00:20:45,305 --> 00:20:47,132
[Aide] Let's lock and load.

311
00:20:47,307 --> 00:20:51,221
There'll be a resolution in the Mid-East
and a bull market. Mark my words.

312
00:20:51,394 --> 00:20:53,468
Thank you for your time.

313
00:20:53,646 --> 00:20:55,436
[Aide] We're on the move.

[Crowd shouts Bob's name]

315
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:04,692
[Man] Good luck, Bob!

316
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:06,986
To the right, please.

317
00:21:07,282 --> 00:21:10,731
Everybody to the right, please.
To the right, thank you.

To the right, please.

319
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,533
Mr Roberts, I contacted your campaign office.

320
00:21:19,709 --> 00:21:24,037
They told me I had to be connected
to a major news network or newspaper.

321
00:21:24,213 --> 00:21:28,376
That's ridiculous. Talk to Chet MacGregor
and he'll take care of it.

322
00:21:36,264 --> 00:21:38,968
- What is your name?
- Bugs.

323
00:21:39,142 --> 00:21:41,132
John Alijah Raplin.

324
00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:43,054
John Raplin. Publication?

325
00:21:43,229 --> 00:21:45,055
<i>Troubled Times.</i>

326
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,518
There'll be a pass at the door tonight.

327
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,523
Yeah. Sure.

328
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:53,266
[Laughter]

329
00:21:53,443 --> 00:21:56,444
- It scares the hell out of me.
- My goodness.

330
00:21:56,615 --> 00:22:00,482
- I don't think so.
- Of course not. It's a bad idea.

331
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:01,940
You wanted to see it through.

332
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:06,531
Mr Hart thinks we should stick with the red,
white and blue. Simplicity and strength.

333
00:22:06,707 --> 00:22:10,075
I agree with Mr Hart. This one is too basic.

334
00:22:10,249 --> 00:22:13,039
This one, I like it but it's too strong.

335
00:22:13,212 --> 00:22:17,126
This one is a nightmare. It scares me.

336
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:22,255
I tend to agree with Mr Hart as well.
Stick with the current campaign. Bart?

337
00:22:22,427 --> 00:22:24,301
- Absolutely.
- Straight up.

338
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:28,763
- Terry, what do you think?
- Me? No question. That's the one.

339
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:31,554
- How about you?
- Nigel?

340
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:35,637
The nodding Nigel. Thank you.

341
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:38,731
Next, our new television commercial.

342
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,730
Guys, get out of the way.
Bob, you sit here. Scat, Bart.

343
00:22:44,153 --> 00:22:48,613
It's 15 seconds. It makes its point strongly.
It starts airing tomorrow.

344
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:53,777
<i>[Choir] For a new day dawning</i>

345
00:22:58,123 --> 00:23:00,745
- What do you think, Bart?
- I love it, Bob.

346
00:23:00,918 --> 00:23:02,165
- Perrigrew?
- Great, Bob.

347
00:23:02,336 --> 00:23:04,956
- Dockett?
- Chilly most, Bob.

348
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,838
- What'd he say?
- Chilly most.

349
00:23:07,007 --> 00:23:10,007
- What's that?
- It means terrific, Bob.

350
00:23:10,176 --> 00:23:14,255
Glad you like it.
We have two more spots in production.

351
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:18,093
We have the mayor's wife outside,
lovely lady, who wants to see you

352
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:21,432
and three boys who want to say hello
to Bob Roberts.

353
00:23:21,602 --> 00:23:23,808
[Security] Cobra Two, we're on the move.

354
00:23:23,978 --> 00:23:25,557
- Hello.
- Hi.

355
00:23:25,732 --> 00:23:27,770
Mrs Davis, this is Bob Roberts.

356
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,265
We're so happy to have you here.

357
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:33,609
We're so proud to play your music
in our home.

358
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:37,280
Sometimes I play it when I'm alone,
but don't tell my husband.

359
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:46,325
Frank and I agree that you are an excellent
example for the youth of this country.

360
00:23:46,498 --> 00:23:51,159
We wish there were more singers like you
and we intend to vote for you.

361
00:23:51,336 --> 00:23:55,035
We're so tired of Brickley Paiste
and his philandering.

362
00:23:55,214 --> 00:24:01,250
- This is my son Roger and his two friends.
- We got all... both album...

363
00:24:01,427 --> 00:24:03,919
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

364
00:24:07,765 --> 00:24:09,973
We got a band. We play some of your songs.

365
00:24:10,144 --> 00:24:14,187
<i>We play Retake America
and This Land Was Made For Me.</i>

366
00:24:14,356 --> 00:24:17,189
- What instrument do you play?
- Guitar. We all play guitar.

367
00:24:17,357 --> 00:24:22,483
When Roger first wanted his guitar,
my husband I were fit as birds.

368
00:24:22,654 --> 00:24:27,859
But my husband trusted that his son
would take the lessons of the Lord with him,

369
00:24:28,032 --> 00:24:31,616
no matter what instrument of the Devil
caressed his hand.

370
00:24:31,787 --> 00:24:33,862
You inspire us to do, like, stuff.

371
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:38,201
- You... you're great.
- I wish that there was... you know, stuff.

372
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:42,537
Like, you know, if there was...
When I heard that...

373
00:24:42,712 --> 00:24:47,005
Are there any more stuff?
Has... When's the new album?

374
00:24:47,175 --> 00:24:49,415
Election Day. We're releasing it Election Day.

375
00:24:49,594 --> 00:24:53,425
Mr Roberts has to be on his way.
What are the songs about?

376
00:24:53,596 --> 00:24:56,170
Various things. Congress, liberals, Iraq.

377
00:24:56,349 --> 00:24:58,506
We heard about that. Iraq.

378
00:24:58,684 --> 00:25:00,925
Yeah. I hope we kick their ass.

379
00:25:01,101 --> 00:25:03,973
So do I. Will it be necessary to use force?

380
00:25:04,146 --> 00:25:07,515
We must be strong
whenever democracy is threatened.

381
00:25:07,691 --> 00:25:13,029
We want to avoid violence but it might
be necessary. Hussein is a madman.

382
00:25:13,195 --> 00:25:16,279
- Sorry, Bob has a show to get ready for.
- Of course.

383
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:22,534
It's been a pleasure meeting you. I wish there
was a way I could vote for you 100 times.

384
00:25:22,703 --> 00:25:24,993
- There is, actually.
- Really?

385
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,664
Just kidding.

386
00:25:29,918 --> 00:25:32,207
[Man whispering]

387
00:25:33,795 --> 00:25:36,549
[Praying]

388
00:25:44,305 --> 00:25:47,970
Let's not show this.
Come on over here with me.

389
00:25:48,141 --> 00:25:52,554
[Bugs] To understand who Bob Roberts is,
you have to understand who Lukas Hart llI is.

390
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:56,228
Lukas Hart is a spook,
one of the Langley crowd new guard.

391
00:25:56,398 --> 00:25:58,640
Hart has been in the shadows for years.

392
00:25:58,818 --> 00:26:03,527
A lieutenant in Vietnam, Special Forces.
Worked on the infamous Phoenix programme.

393
00:26:03,698 --> 00:26:07,112
Transferred to South America,
helped overthrow Allende.

394
00:26:07,283 --> 00:26:10,615
In Central America,
he probably popped a couple of heads.

395
00:26:10,784 --> 00:26:16,289
Set up an organisation, Broken Dove, which
supplied transport planes to US operatives.

396
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:19,577
Got his hands dirty in Iran-Contra,
but the Senate washed him clean.

397
00:26:19,753 --> 00:26:23,700
<i>- I can't recall, sir.
- You can't recall. I see.</i>

398
00:26:24,507 --> 00:26:27,957
<i>Did you or your organisation Broken Dove</i>

399
00:26:28,135 --> 00:26:31,966
<i>have anything to do with a transport plane
downed in Nicaragua...</i>

400
00:26:32,137 --> 00:26:34,591
<i>- Sir...
... on May 23rd, 1987?</i>

401
00:26:34,764 --> 00:26:37,800
<i>The plane was contracted
to fly humanitarian supplies</i>

402
00:26:37,975 --> 00:26:42,353
<i>into impoverished regions
in southern Honduras.</i>

403
00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:45,723
<i>Broken Dove is a private relief corporation.</i>

404
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:48,935
<i>You had no knowledge of the guns
on that plane?</i>

405
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:50,355
<i>No, sir.</i>

406
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:53,812
<i>The three men were all
close business associates of yours?</i>

407
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:56,313
<i>Rest their souls, yes.</i>

408
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:59,860
<i>They were patriots acting
on their own volition, their own beliefs.</i>

409
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,407
<i>Can you sum up these beliefs for us?</i>

410
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:07,787
<i>That the US Congress was restricting
the growth and safeguard of democracy</i>

411
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,247
<i>in Central America.</i>

412
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:13,835
<i>That the actions of these men,
although against the Boland Amendment,</i>

413
00:27:14,006 --> 00:27:17,171
<i>were nevertheless on the side
of goodness and decency.</i>

414
00:27:17,342 --> 00:27:19,714
<i>I have a copy of an FBI report</i>

415
00:27:19,884 --> 00:27:23,835
<i>regarding traces of cocaine
found on one of the transport planes.</i>

416
00:27:24,013 --> 00:27:27,217
<i>This is sensitive material
that should be dealt with in closed session.</i>

417
00:27:27,393 --> 00:27:32,977
<i>This is an example of the depths to which
the US Congress is prepared to sink.</i>

418
00:27:33,146 --> 00:27:35,020
<i>This is a travesty.</i>

419
00:27:35,191 --> 00:27:39,769
[Terry] The charges were found to be
groundless and Broken Dove was exonerated.

420
00:27:39,945 --> 00:27:42,102
The whole investigation was a sham.

421
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,193
They discovered a secret government of liars
and drug smugglers and did nothing.

422
00:27:46,367 --> 00:27:49,652
Slap on the wrist.
The story died in the major press.

423
00:27:49,827 --> 00:27:53,361
Idiots like me keep investigating
to find out how deep it goes.

424
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:56,077
I have a contact who claims to have evidence

425
00:27:56,249 --> 00:28:01,327
that connects Broken Dove to a failed
savings and loan. It could be big. Gotta go.

426
00:28:01,504 --> 00:28:06,046
<i>[Hayden] I cannot believe the lies
and innuendo you have been the victim of.</i>

427
00:28:06,216 --> 00:28:12,550
<i>It is clear that you had no involvement with
this escapade and we're wasting your time.</i>

428
00:28:12,722 --> 00:28:15,804
<i>- I am sorry.
- I appreciate that.</i>

429
00:28:15,974 --> 00:28:19,058
<i>Is there anything
that you would like to add, Mr Hart?</i>

430
00:28:19,229 --> 00:28:23,935
<i>These allegations are erroneous at best,
always have been, always will be.</i>

431
00:28:24,106 --> 00:28:27,973
<i>How much more of this fiction
must my family suffer?</i>

432
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,772
<i>God knows, I've done enough by now</i>

433
00:28:30,946 --> 00:28:34,610
<i>to make my position on narcotics
perfectly clear.</i>

434
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:36,858
<i>Drugs stink</i>

435
00:28:37,034 --> 00:28:38,575
<i>They make me sick</i>

436
00:28:39,662 --> 00:28:41,489
<i>Those that sell 'em</i>

437
00:28:41,663 --> 00:28:43,988
<i>And those who do 'em</i>

438
00:28:44,165 --> 00:28:46,156
<i>String 'em up</i>

439
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,490
<i>From the highest tree</i>

440
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:52,713

[Paiste] Mr Bob Roberts suggested he knew
which way I was leaning

466
00:30:25,374 --> 00:30:27,663
on the question of war in the Middle East.

467
00:30:27,835 --> 00:30:32,081
I am totally opposed to it.
It's the enemy of the month club again.

468
00:30:32,255 --> 00:30:37,378
Saddam Hussein, I believe, is the most
evil man - what did the President say? -

469
00:30:37,552 --> 00:30:39,590
since Adolf Hitler.

470
00:30:39,761 --> 00:30:45,465
Before that, it was Noriega.
He was the most evil man since Fu Manchu.

471
00:30:45,642 --> 00:30:48,677
And there was Gaddafi and there was Castro.

472
00:30:48,853 --> 00:30:53,643
And these figures are thrown out to the media
and made into great monsters.

473
00:30:53,814 --> 00:30:57,481
Why? Because we must justify
the military budget.

474
00:30:57,652 --> 00:31:00,687
In order to do that, you must have enemies.

475
00:31:00,863 --> 00:31:06,816
So we blow up these local thugs
into these huge, Hitler-like figures

476
00:31:06,993 --> 00:31:09,909
and pretend it's World War II all over again.

477
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:13,163
[Aide] Do not pin your hopes and dreams
on transport planes.

478
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:16,782
They'll only build transport planes
if the shooting war is prolonged.

479
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,254
It's not going to be another Vietnam.
A little bird tells me this.

480
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:27,630
- Was it Hart, Dockett?
- Hi, Lisa. Mr Bourne will be dropping by.

481
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:31,846
Don't wait for him. Come on, get it.

482
00:31:32,014 --> 00:31:36,093
Buy 6,012. Next. Sell 45,000.

How can I help you vote Bob?

485
00:31:50,446 --> 00:31:51,903
Bob, you're the best.

486
00:31:52,072 --> 00:31:56,365

- Cheez whiz, Calvin, don't be a fag! God!

487
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,276
You support Broken Dove?

488
00:31:59,452 --> 00:32:03,700
Yes, proudly. Broken Dove works effectively
to keep children off drugs.

489
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:06,995
Before its current incarnation
as an anti-drugs organisation,

490
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:11,379
Broken Dove bought transport planes
that smuggled drugs.

491
00:32:11,547 --> 00:32:14,501
That is absurd and subversive and old news.

492
00:32:14,673 --> 00:32:18,921
Broken Dove was exonerated of these
ridiculous charges by the US Senate.

493
00:32:19,096 --> 00:32:24,052
Evidence suggests these planes were bought
with money from a low-income housing loan

494
00:32:24,224 --> 00:32:27,475
from West Pennsylvania Savings and Loan,
now insolvent.

495
00:32:27,644 --> 00:32:28,723
What are you saying?

496
00:32:28,895 --> 00:32:32,644
You took money meant for housing
to buy planes to smuggle drugs.

497
00:32:32,815 --> 00:32:35,020
Ridiculous. Chet, did you hear that?

498
00:32:35,192 --> 00:32:38,396
- Where is the money from those loans?
- Building housing.

499
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:41,190
Where exactly are these houses?

500
00:32:42,322 --> 00:32:46,734
Do you feel any responsibility for the illegal
activities carried out by groups you support?

501
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:51,786
I told you. Broken Dove was exonerated
of these charges.

502
00:32:51,956 --> 00:32:55,823
Why would you ask a question like that?
What would motivate you?

503
00:32:56,001 --> 00:33:01,206
I am talking about new evidence
connecting Broken Dove to the failed S&L.

504
00:33:01,381 --> 00:33:03,752
What is your question? Ask the question.

505
00:33:03,924 --> 00:33:07,706
A group that you support
was recently implicated...

506
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:10,127
What is meant by the word "implicated"?

507
00:33:10,305 --> 00:33:14,348
- To suggest. To connect.
- Not proved. Not to indict.

508
00:33:14,516 --> 00:33:17,851
Are you making allegations
you're willing to back up in court?

509
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:21,187
The camera just documented all this on film.

510
00:33:21,357 --> 00:33:24,025
I don't think you're being fair.

511
00:33:24,191 --> 00:33:27,062
- Where is your evidence?
- I have a sworn affidavit.

512
00:33:27,235 --> 00:33:31,944
You're not showing any respect and you're
abusing your responsibility as a journalist.

513
00:33:32,116 --> 00:33:34,273
Leave it on.

514
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:39,110
Is being responsible as a journalist to ignore
the issues, to gloss over the facts?

515
00:33:39,287 --> 00:33:42,203
No. Responsible journalism is objective.

516
00:33:42,373 --> 00:33:46,452
The interiewer does not bring
his own opinions into the interiew.

517
00:33:46,629 --> 00:33:49,497
I asked a question and you evaded it.

518
00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:54,416
I evaded nothing. You have asked a slanted
question based on lies and conjecture

519
00:33:54,591 --> 00:33:58,506
and I have given an answer appropriate
to that kind of yellow journalism.

520
00:33:58,678 --> 00:34:03,423
- That answer is?
- The answer is I don't talk to liars or gossips.

521
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:07,761
- The interiew is over. Thanks for your time.
- Turn the camera off now, please.

522
00:34:07,936 --> 00:34:11,353
Bart, please escort this gentleman to the door.

523
00:34:11,523 --> 00:34:15,769
Mr Roberts, is it true you referred to crack
as a great equaliser?

524
00:34:15,942 --> 00:34:17,059
Camera off.

525
00:34:17,236 --> 00:34:21,897
And suggesting that crack seres
to reduce the African-American population?

526
00:34:22,073 --> 00:34:26,070
- When Bob says cut it off, cut it off.
- It's off now.

527
00:34:26,242 --> 00:34:28,282
- Is that off?
- Yes, it's off.

528
00:34:28,453 --> 00:34:31,324
What the hell is this? This is a meltdown!

529
00:34:31,498 --> 00:34:33,705
- Where were your men?
- We took the wrong door.

530
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:36,494

531

You were supposed to go where? You were
supposed to meet me upstairs. Listen to me.

606
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,899
<i>And I remind the public</i>

607
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,561
<i>that Brickley Paiste still has not told us</i>

608

<i>how he will vote

A series of photo opportunities
is perhaps more precise.

623
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,978
of a very disturbing sort.

624
00:41:48,155 --> 00:41:52,532
I haven't any idea who he is.
I haven't any idea what he's like.

I don't think I'm supposed to have any idea.

626
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:02,663
I know that he proved to be a master
of pushing racist buttons and sexist buttons,

627
00:42:02,835 --> 00:42:04,626
this and that.

He's very good at that.

What's behind it?
I don't see anybody at home.

631
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:19,965
But I will say that once or twice
in the course of our debate

632
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:26,095

740
00:50:42,481 --> 00:50:47,021
<i>From our sister station in Harrisburg,
correspondent Rock Bork.</i>

741
00:50:47,191 --> 00:50:50,561
<i>Behind me was once
the West Pennsylvania Savings and Loan</i>

742
00:50:50,737 --> 00:50:53,274
<i>which until last year was a viable thrift.</i>

743
00:50:53,446 --> 00:50:55,984
<i>Federal regulators closed the bank</i>

744
00:50:56,158 --> 00:51:00,071
<i>and began an investigation of improprieties
involving misuse of funds.</i>

745
00:51:00,245 --> 00:51:04,870
<i>Today comes information that Lukas Hart III,
Bob Roberts' campaign chairman,</i>

746
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:10,330
<i>may be subpoenaed to tell the regulators
what he knows about Broken Dove</i>

747
00:51:10,502 --> 00:51:12,460
<i>and unpaid housing loans.</i>

748
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:17,920
Hello, reality check. Broken Dove ripping off
S&Ls? Its altruism surpasses net worth.

749
00:51:18,092 --> 00:51:21,295
Broken Dove whose donations
to hospitals keep youngsters off drugs.

750
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:24,140
- Accuse your enemy of your worst crime.
- Disinformation.

751
00:51:24,305 --> 00:51:26,678
- Credo hipocritus.
- Pot calling the kettle black.

752
00:51:26,851 --> 00:51:31,760
Terry, most political campaigns
would pale in comparison,

753
00:51:31,938 --> 00:51:34,095
but this one is a peach.

754
00:51:34,273 --> 00:51:38,104
- It's like a vicious, hard-fought game.
- [Man bellows]

755
00:51:38,276 --> 00:51:42,189
Close to the final minute,
absolute chaos reigns

756
00:51:42,362 --> 00:51:46,941
and then one team explodes
right through the proverbial roof.

757
00:51:47,117 --> 00:51:50,070
The dust settles, the blood is flowing,
it's a massacre

758
00:51:50,244 --> 00:51:54,454
but one team is jumping up and down
with big, silly grins on their faces.

759
00:51:54,623 --> 00:51:57,623
That's gonna be us, Terry.
That's what it's all about, fun.

760
00:51:57,793 --> 00:52:00,793
There's nothing like the unbridled fun
of a hard-fought campaign.

761
00:52:00,962 --> 00:52:03,418
- He's down!
- Bob! Bob!

762
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:06,258
- Stay down!
- [Woman] My God! Bob!

763
00:52:06,425 --> 00:52:08,750
[All shouting]

764
00:52:10,053 --> 00:52:13,503
- Seal the wound!
- Call an ambulance!

765
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:19,173
Get your goddamn hands off me, you fag!

766
00:52:19,353 --> 00:52:22,270
- Move it!
- Get the bike!

767
00:52:25,149 --> 00:52:27,023
Put your guns away!

768
00:52:28,984 --> 00:52:32,069
You get on the goddamn bus.
Security's falling apart.

769
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:34,314
Bush league, pal.

770
00:52:34,489 --> 00:52:38,569
- Get the goddamn camera out of here!
- Terry, ride behind in the van.

771
00:52:39,828 --> 00:52:43,528
<i>[Choir] We shall not
Not be moved</i>

<i>We shall not be moved
We shall not be moved</i>

779
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:15,351
Hypocrisy that winds itself down every day
from Washington, DC.

780
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:23,521
The hypocrisy of an organisation
that calls itself the US Congress.

781
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:32,737
<i>Times are changin' back today...</i>

782
00:53:32,914 --> 00:53:38,371
The hypocrisy of an investigation
that seeks to implicate patriots,

783
00:53:38,543 --> 00:53:40,536
our dearest friends,

784
00:53:40,713 --> 00:53:44,840
in the constant struggle
to make this land a pure one again.

785
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:49,085
<i>Times are changin'
Changin' back</i>

786
00:53:49,261 --> 00:53:54,503
<i>Whoa... yeah</i>

787
00:53:54,807 --> 00:54:00,725
Lord, pave the way for a rebel's path
to Washington, DC.

788
00:54:00,897 --> 00:54:05,025
Make the road a smooth one for Bob Roberts.

789
00:54:05,192 --> 00:54:10,433
A man who can clean up the Devil's mess
in our capital.

790
00:54:10,612 --> 00:54:12,403
- Say amen.
- Amen.

796

<i>It was announced that Lukas Hart III,

<i>The timing is meant to hurt us</i>

this pathetic attempt to derail our campaign.</i>

<i>The subpoena has come
as a shock to the campaign.</i>

Not in a real interesting way.

822
00:56:21,513 --> 00:56:26,423
- More like in expense of the immigrants.
- Immigrants love the Kornhausers.

Polly's favourite is the lobster family.

- Musical guest.

You said KRS-One
was gonna be the musical guest.

839

- In LA.
- Standards.

841
00:57:29,945 --> 00:57:34,108
- They got sick in LA. They can't fly.
- It was definitely standards.

842

- I think it's an ear thing and they can't fly.
- Standards.

- That was good for time.

- I'm not going to say that.

John, if you say the first part over again.

- And they have to stand together.

<i>[Paiste] Offhand, I would not say that being

<i>for a legislator of the United States.</i>

858
00:58:37,545 --> 00:58:41,328
I believe in Mr Bob Roberts' background,

859
00:58:41,506 --> 00:58:46,926
if it is true that he has had
some experience with the CIA,

860
00:58:47,094 --> 00:58:50,678
then he comes better prepared
than most people do to the Senate

861
00:58:50,847 --> 00:58:55,058
with a knowledge of what the real government
of the United States is,

862
00:58:55,227 --> 00:58:57,349
which is the National Security Council.

863
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,603
It was created in 1950 by Harry Truman

864
00:59:00,773 --> 00:59:04,521
and the country is governed
by the National Security Council,

865
00:59:04,692 --> 00:59:07,184
which is the Defense Department, the CIA,

866
00:59:07,361 --> 00:59:12,781
in combination with the great makers
of weapons around the country.

867
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:16,898
So he's already had some initiation
into true power.

868
00:59:17,078 --> 00:59:20,113
In the beginning, our great company
provided appliances.

869
00:59:20,289 --> 00:59:24,582
We heated your home, refrigerated your food,
improved the quality of your life.

870
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:30,622
We prospered and grew into a multinational
corporation. We own this very network.

00:59:30,797 --> 00:59:33,467
<i>- Don't Vote and a new song.
- Brand-new.</i>

Yeah, and Prevailing Tides. Michael?</i>

873
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:43,128
Our chief source of income, however,
is the arms industry.

874
00:59:43,307 --> 00:59:47,850
Yes, we rely heavily
on those fat government contracts

875
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:51,388
to make these useless weapons
of mass destruction.

876
00:59:51,565 --> 00:59:55,183
Even though we have been convicted
for fraud several times,

877
00:59:55,360 --> 01:00:00,651
you don't hear too much about our bad side
because, well, we own our own news division.

878
01:00:00,823 --> 01:00:03,443
- Bob doesn't care what we agreed on.
- Really?

879
01:00:03,615 --> 01:00:07,484
He feels very strongly about the new material.

880
01:00:07,663 --> 01:00:11,364
He feels it should be said right now
and will not back down.

881
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:15,040
Chances are slim that you'll hear
of our environmental mishaps

882
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:17,747
or the way we bust those unions.

883
01:00:17,922 --> 01:00:20,543
We even have a highly rated show

884
01:00:20,714 --> 01:00:23,999
that the public buys as entertainment
with a leftist slant.

885
01:00:24,175 --> 01:00:30,010
I'm sorry, but we have a policy that no new

01:22:55,599 --> 01:23:00,011
"Dear Bob, even though it's not
Valentine's Day, will you be mine?"

1183
01:23:00,185 --> 01:23:05,309
- "Signed, Amy Biddle Richman, aged seven. "
- Oh, that's sweet. Look at that.

1184
01:23:07,606 --> 01:23:09,432
Why don't we send a letter back to her?

1185
01:23:09,608 --> 01:23:14,066
"Dear Amy, your Valentine has made
this difficult transition much easier. "

1186
01:23:14,233 --> 01:23:17,269
"Be good and don't do crack.
It's a ghetto drug. "

1187
01:23:17,445 --> 01:23:19,319
Straight up, Bob.

1188
01:23:19,489 --> 01:23:22,571
To Amy. And all the future soldiers
throughout the land.

1189
01:23:22,738 --> 01:23:24,777
Hear, hear.

1190

"Make America great for Christian people.
God bless, Doreen Graff, Millersville. "

1191
01:23:30,158 --> 01:23:34,236
Somebody got off an early Christmas card.
"Merry Christmas. "

1192
01:23:34,412 --> 01:23:39,614
"Where the body is, there will the vultures
be gathered. Love, Billy LaRay. "

1193
01:23:39,786 --> 01:23:42,704
Here's one from the board of directors
at Interunys.

1194
01:23:42,873 --> 01:23:46,158
"We send our support.
Best wishes for a complete recovery. "

1195
01:23:46,335 --> 01:23:48,575
"Interunys is a Fortune 500 company,

Goodbye, all.

1206
01:24:34,856 --> 01:24:38,604
Dolores, maybe you better lie down for a while.

1207
01:24:38,774 --> 01:24:41,644
- Dolores.
- [Terry] Something wrong?

1208
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:45,864
She's been working very hard.
I think she's had a bit of the bubbly.

1209
01:24:46,032 --> 01:24:48,190
She could never say no to the Pérignon.

1210
01:24:55,536 --> 01:24:58,075
[Man] You better watch yourself, my friend!

1211
01:24:58,246 --> 01:25:01,826
I've got my eye on you, my friend!
You're dead!

1212
01:25:05,917 --> 01:25:09,916
It appears that the gun was placed
on my client's person

1213
01:25:10,087 --> 01:25:13,171
- by a third party at the time of the shooting.
- How do you know?

1214
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:17,006
Fingerprints indicate that the gun
was fired by Mr Raplin's right hand.

1215
01:25:17,177 --> 01:25:21,086
He cannot pick up a fork, let alone fire a gun.

1216
01:25:21,261 --> 01:25:25,472
He has constrictive palsy,
which cripples motor functions in that limb.

1217
01:25:25,639 --> 01:25:28,389
There were no powder burns on his clothing.

1218
01:25:28,556 --> 01:25:31,722
- Why was he held in custody?
- You tell me.

1219
01:25:31,896 --> 01:25:34,678
Dolores? Dolores?

1220
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,180
Dolores?

1221
01:25:39,355 --> 01:25:41,975
- I can't talk to you.
- Have you left Bob?

1222
01:25:42,150 --> 01:25:44,818
- Are you no longer working for him?
- That is correct.

1223
01:25:44,985 --> 01:25:48,814
- What happened?
- A mutual decision. I felt it was time to go.

1224
01:25:48,989 --> 01:25:51,143
- I don't believe you.
- Sorry about that.

1225
01:25:51,321 --> 01:25:56,905
Raplin's been released. He couldn't have fired
the gun. Is there something we should know?

1226
01:25:58,283 --> 01:26:04,403
You see, the truth of this is that American
taxpayers have been paying for covert war.

1227
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:08,992
Illegal covert war waged in countries
we haven't even heard of.

1228
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:11,739
Central America, thousands have died.

1229
01:26:11,918 --> 01:26:15,120
Chile, Indonesia, Africa.

1230
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:19,957
Until now, Americans paid for these wars
every time they did cocaine or crack or heroin

1231
01:26:20,131 --> 01:26:26,300
or any other illegal drug smuggled in
by these self-proclaimed patriots.

1232
01:26:26,466 --> 01:26:32,171
Now we have a situation where all Americans
will soon pay for these smugglings of drugs

1233
01:26:32,347 --> 01:26:35,882
in the form of taxes
to bail out failed savings and loans.

1234
01:26:36,059 --> 01:26:38,547
Savings and loans
that misused people's funds

1235
01:26:38,726 --> 01:26:42,508
and provided money
to illegal covert drug smuggling operations.

1236
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:44,393
And surprise.

1237
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:48,771
We find ourselves with a seemingly
insurmountable drug problem.

1238
01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:52,806
<i>[Airport tannoy announcement]</i>

1239
01:26:55,236 --> 01:26:59,234
- How do you feel, Bob?
- Great. There's a new day dawning.

1240
01:26:59,404 --> 01:27:01,692
What about the release of Alijah Raplin?

1241
01:27:01,864 --> 01:27:05,613
It's obvious that the legal system
is too lenient on criminals.

1242
01:27:05,783 --> 01:27:09,199
I will see to it that this leniency
ends in our lifetime

1243
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:11,657
and criminals like Raplin get their just due.

1244
01:27:11,831 --> 01:27:14,865
- Have you been to Washington before?
- Yes. This time is special.

1245
01:27:15,041 --> 01:27:19,787
It's a new town now
because Bob Roberts is here to stay.

1246
01:27:25,918 --> 01:27:30,380
[Bugs] Iran-Contra happened because no one
did anything substantial about Watergate.

1247
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:34,842
And Watergate happened because there
were no consequences from the Bay of Pigs.

1248
01:27:35,011 --> 01:27:36,718
They're all the same operatives.

1249
01:27:36,887 --> 01:27:39,922
The soldiers in the Bay of Pigs,
the plumbers busted at Watergate,

1250
01:27:40,099 --> 01:27:43,547
the gun-runners in Iran-Contra,
all the same people.

1251
01:27:43,724 --> 01:27:46,011
It's easy to figure out the connection -

1252
01:27:46,185 --> 01:27:50,309
a secret government beyond the control
of the people and accountable to no one.

1253
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:55,684
The closer we are to finding the connection,
the more Congress turns a blind eye to it.

1254
01:27:55,858 --> 01:27:59,984
"We can't talk about that in open session,"
they say. "National security. "

1255
01:28:00,148 --> 01:28:05,308
The truth lies dormant and they stay blind
out of choice. A conspiracy of silence.

1256
01:28:05,485 --> 01:28:10,397
I think the entire Congress is quite aware
of the National Security Council

1257
01:28:10,575 --> 01:28:15,862
and its powers and its functions and the fact
that this is a national security state

1258
01:28:16,035 --> 01:28:19,201
and less and less of a representative one.

1259
01:28:19,371 --> 01:28:25,411
It's... You know the story of the frog
in the... in the pan of cold water?

1260
01:28:25,584 --> 01:28:30,575
If you throw a frog into hot water,
it'll jump around and suffer greatly and die.

1261
01:28:30,753 --> 01:28:35,460
If you put the frog in a pan of cold water
and put that on the stove

1262
01:28:35,631 --> 01:28:40,921
and you heat it to the boiling point,
the frog doesn't stir, he doesn't feel it.

1263
01:28:41,093 --> 01:28:43,331
And at the end of it, he's dead.

1264
01:28:43,512 --> 01:28:46,426
These things happen incrementally,
they're gradual.

1265
01:28:46,595 --> 01:28:50,509
Are we complicit? Yes, we are.
Are we revolutionaries?

1266
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:52,473
How do you do it once you're here?

1267
01:28:52,642 --> 01:28:57,682
There are no Mr Smiths in Washington.
Mr Smith has been bought.

1268
01:28:59,731 --> 01:29:02,268
Just a bunch of deal-makers.

1269
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:06,815
No visionaries. No one really concerned
with the disenfranchised.

1270
01:29:06,983 --> 01:29:11,562
Just a secret state of business liaisons
so out of control

1271
01:29:11,737 --> 01:29:16,811
that they're willing to send American soldiers
to war to protect their business interests.

I was the first one to find out, though.
