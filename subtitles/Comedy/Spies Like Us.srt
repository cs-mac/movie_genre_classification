FROM THE NAT-SAT
PRINTING ROOM.

8
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:11,327
WHY DON'T YOU
SAY IT A LITTLE LOUDER?

9
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:12,328
WE COULD OPEN
THE WINDOW.

10
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:14,330
YOU COULD SHOUT IT
TOWARDS MOSCOW.

11
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,331
SORRY. I--

12
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:18,334
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
YOU'RE STUPID.

13
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:21,838
JUST OPEN THE CASE
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

14
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:24,841
THE CASE IS CHAINED
TO MY WRIST.

15
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:26,843
SECURITY DISPATCH
HAS THE KEY.

16
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:29,846
LEAVE THE MATERIAL,
TAKE THE CASE,

17
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:31,848
AND WAIT OUTSIDE.

18
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:33,850
NO CAN DO.

19
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,852
THE MATERIAL'S
LOCKED INSIDE.

20
00:05:35,852 --> 00:05:38,855
ALL RIGHT.
JUST GIVE IT TO ME.

21
00:05:46,362 --> 00:05:48,364
GET IN THE CLOSET.

00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:10,887
TRANSMITTED THIS STUFF
AN HOUR AGO.

24
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:12,889
BEAUTIFUL CLOSE-UPS!

25
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:15,892
MIEGS AND SLINE
WILL DROOL.

26
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:18,895
THEY'RE LATE AGAIN.
UNUSUAL FOR SOLDIERS.

27
00:06:18,895 --> 00:06:21,898
THEY KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

28
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:27,403
GENTLEMEN.

29
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:29,906
HERE THEY ARE.

30
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:32,408
ARE THOSE THE SHOTS
FROM THE LATEST FLY-BY?

31
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:33,910
OVER HERE, GENERAL.

32
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:38,915
WAIT.

33
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:41,417
IS SOMEONE
IN THIS CLOSET?

34
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:42,418
IGNORE HIM.

35
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:44,420
HE'S JUST ONE
OF OUR COURIERS.

36
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:47,924
WELL...OK.

37
00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:49,425
NICE CLOSE-UPS.

38
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:52,428
DEFINITELY APPROACHING
FULL-GO HOUR.

39
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:58,935
I GREASED THE HOUSE COMMITTEE
FOR COVERT APPROPRIATIONS.

40
00:06:58,935 --> 00:07:02,939
THEY THINK THE FUNDS ARE
FOR MORE STEALTH BOMBERS.

41
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:04,941
WE'VE SELECTED
2 GLG-20s--

42
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:06,943
THEY'RE THE BEST MEN
WE HAVE.

43
00:07:06,943 --> 00:07:09,445
THE LAST 2
WERE THE BEST MEN WE HAD.

44
00:07:09,445 --> 00:07:11,948
NOW THEY'RE OUR
2 BEST DEAD MEN.

45
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:14,450
I'M CONVINCED
THERE'S A SECURITY LEAK

46
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,952
IN YOUR TRAINING PROGRAM.

47
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:18,454
WELL, WE COULD
BYPASS TRAINING.

48
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:21,958
NO. THEY'LL TRAIN WITH
2 OTHER GLG-20s--

49
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:25,461
2 WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE PROJECT

50
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:27,463
AND 2 WHO ARE...

51
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:28,965
DISPOSABLE.

52
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:30,967
ARE YOU SUGGESTING
WE ASSIGN THIS JOB

53
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:31,968
TO INFERIOR PERSONNEL?

54
00:07:32,468 --> 00:07:33,970
NO, I UNDERSTAND.

55
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,471
2 TEAMS.

56
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:37,473
ONE TO DO THE JOB,

57
00:07:37,974 --> 00:07:39,976
THE OTHER
TO BE A DIVERSION.

58
00:07:39,976 --> 00:07:42,979
YOU MEAN DECOYS? TARGETS?

59
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:43,980
EXACTLY.

60
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,482
GLG-20s DON'T
EXACTLY GROW ON TREES.

61
00:07:46,482 --> 00:07:48,985
I'D HATE TO WASTE
2 OF THEM AS TARGETS.

62
00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:50,987
I'M SURE YOU CAN FIND
A COUPLE OF MEN

I WAS BORN

129
00:11:19,362 --> 00:11:20,863
YEAH, WITH NEW
VOICE-SCRAMBLERS.

130
00:11:20,863 --> 00:11:25,368
OH. WHAT ABOUT THAT
RED-CHINESE RADIO CHATTER?

131
00:11:25,868 --> 00:11:28,371
IT'S DONE.
HERE YOU GO.

133
00:11:31,874 --> 00:11:33,376

TRIPLE-SCRAMBLED
MICROWAVE TRANSMISSION

BETWEEN 2 SOLDIERS
TALKING IN MANDARIN CHINESE.

136
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,382
THEY WERE ONLY USING

137
00:11:39,382 --> 00:11:41,384
A SIMPLE POLYPHONETICALLY
GROUPED 20-DIGIT KEY

00:11:45,388 --> 00:11:47,890
I BROKE IT WITH THIS.

141

A DROGAN'S
DECODER WHEEL?

142
00:11:49,892 --> 00:11:52,395
THEY PUT THESE INTO
CEREAL BOXES FOR KIDS.

143
00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:56,399
YEAH, I FOUND IT IN
A BOX OF LUCKY CHARMS.

144
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,901
BREAK IT DOWN AGAIN
WITH THE MACHINES!

145
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:00,903
I ALREADY DID.

146
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:07,410
WELL, THEN...
CLEAN UP THE DESK!

147
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:13,916
GOOD.

148
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,418
THAT'S MUCH BETTER.

149
00:12:15,418 --> 00:12:18,921
BY THE WAY, GOOD LUCK

00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:28,931
I HAVEN'T STUDIED.
I'M NOT PREPARED.

00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:31,934
YOU WERE BUMPED UP

156

YOU'RE SCHEDULED

157
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:36,439

160
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:43,446
YOU WANT ME
TO FAIL THAT TEST

161
00:12:43,946 --> 00:12:46,449
SO YOU CAN KEEP ME IN
THE CENTER OF THE EARTH

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

809
00:58:13,339 --> 00:58:16,843
THAT METAL CASE SHE WAS
PACKING ON HER HORSE.

810
00:58:16,843 --> 00:58:17,844
WHAT ABOUT IT?

811
00:58:17,844 --> 00:58:19,345
IT'S A SAT SCRAMBLER
TERMINAL.

812
00:58:19,846 --> 00:58:20,847
SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT
FOR SENDING, SCRAMBLING,

813
00:58:21,347 --> 00:58:23,349
AND RECEIVING
SATELLITE MESSAGES.

814
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:25,351
SO SHE'S
A SOPHISTICATED WOMAN.

815
00:58:25,852 --> 00:58:27,353
IT'S A HIGHLY
CLASSIFIED PIECE

816
00:58:27,854 --> 00:58:29,355
OF INTELLIGENCE
HARDWARE.

817
00:58:29,856 --> 00:58:32,358
SHE'S A HIGH-CLASS
INTELLIGENT PIECE.

818
00:58:32,859 --> 00:58:34,360
KNOCK IT OFF.

819
00:58:34,861 --> 00:58:37,363
YOU'RE SAYING THAT
THEY'RE SPIES LIKE US?

820
00:58:37,864 --> 00:58:41,367
THEY'RE SPIES, BUT NOT
NECESSARILY ON OUR SIDE.

821
00:58:43,369 --> 00:58:45,872
I THINK IT'S OUR DUTY
AS AMERICAN OPERATIVES

822
00:58:46,372 --> 00:58:48,875
TO FOLLOW HER AND
FIND OUT WHAT SHE'S UP TO.

823
00:58:49,375 --> 00:58:50,877
YOU JUST WANT
TO FOLLOW HER.

824
00:58:51,377 --> 00:58:51,878
NO.

825
00:58:52,378 --> 00:58:54,380
YOU'RE THINKING
WITH YOUR DICK.

826
00:58:54,881 --> 00:58:56,883
THEY LEFT THEIR
LAND ROVER HERE.

827
00:58:57,383 --> 00:58:58,885
THEY'RE PROBABLY
HEADED FOR THE BORDER.

828
00:58:58,885 --> 00:59:01,387
IT WOULD SAVE US
A LOT OF TROUBLE.

829
00:59:01,888 --> 00:59:04,891
THEY SEEM TO BE HEADED
IN THAT DIRECTION.

830
00:59:04,891 --> 00:59:06,392
MAYBE YOUR DICK'S
NOT SO DUMB.

831
00:59:06,392 --> 00:59:08,595
GOT ME THROUGH
HIGH SCHOOL.

832
00:59:22,575 --> 00:59:25,578
DO YOU THINK THOSE MEN
ARE FOLLOWING US?

833
00:59:28,581 --> 00:59:31,084
THEY'RE MOST LIKELY
CHITRALI NOMADS.

834
00:59:31,084 --> 00:59:32,585
NOT TO WORRY.

835
00:59:51,104 --> 00:59:52,605
DID YOU SAY SIT?

836
00:59:53,106 --> 00:59:54,107
I DIDN'T SAY SIT.

837
00:59:54,107 --> 00:59:55,608
DID YOU SAY SIT?

838
00:59:55,608 --> 00:59:58,111
NO, I DIDN'T SAY SIT.
WHAT--

839
01:00:04,117 --> 01:00:05,618
NOW WHAT?

840
01:00:05,618 --> 01:00:08,121
I GUESS WE WALK.

841
01:00:15,628 --> 01:00:18,131
[GROWLING]

842
01:00:36,649 --> 01:00:39,652
WHY DO WE HAVE TO CARRY
ALL THIS STUFF?

843
01:00:39,652 --> 01:00:42,655
THE DUSHANBE ROAD RUNS ACROSS
THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAINS.

844
01:00:42,655 --> 01:00:45,158
IT'LL BE SUB-ARCTIC
TEMPERATURES UP THERE.

845
01:00:45,158 --> 01:00:47,160
YOU'LL THANK ME.

846
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,162
"YOU'LL THANK ME."

847
01:01:20,193 --> 01:01:21,194
THAT'S IT.

848
01:01:21,194 --> 01:01:23,196
THE DUSHANBE ROAD...

849
01:01:23,196 --> 01:01:26,699
WHERE WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO MEET OUR CONTACTS...

850
01:01:26,699 --> 01:01:28,201
I HOPE.

851
01:01:33,673 --> 01:01:37,009
ONLY INSOFAR AS IT
SERVES TO CONFIRM

852
01:01:37,009 --> 01:01:38,961
THE PRESIDENT'S
OWN BELIEFS.

853
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:41,964
THIS IS QUITE
AN EXCITING PROJECT.

854
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:43,966
WHAT WAS THE COST OF
THIS STAR WARS SYSTEM?

855
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:45,968
JUST UNDER
$60 BILLION.

856
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:46,969
QUITE A BARGAIN.

COUNT ON OUR PEOPLE.

WELL, THIS IS IT.

866
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,003
WHERE ARE THOSE CONTACTS
WE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT?

867
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:23,506
DID THEY SAY WHERE
ON THE ROAD?

868
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:25,007
NO.

869
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:27,510
MAYBE WE SHOULD
START HITCHHIKING.

870

WE'RE INSIDE
THE SOVIET UNION.

I WISH WE HADN'T
LOST BOYER.

872
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:37,019

BOTHER WHISPERING.

WE CAN'T JUST
GO WITH THEM.

884

WHAT OTHER CHOICE
DO WE HAVE?
