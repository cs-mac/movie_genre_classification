00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:30,815
Crazy.

157
00:09:30,898 --> 00:09:34,485
I bet he's already got
your name on a locker.

158
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:39,156
It's always been my dad's dream. Now
I'm going to end up at his alma mater.

159
00:09:41,993 --> 00:09:43,327
Did I just say that?

160
00:09:46,205 --> 00:09:50,501
My mom and I have been talking about
Stanford pretty much since I was born.

161
00:09:50,543 --> 00:09:53,880
And you're already in. That's so cool.

162
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:59,844
Except she won't stop talking
about it. It's embarrassing.

163
00:09:59,886 --> 00:10:02,138
Come on. She's proud of you.

164
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:05,641
I'm proud of you.

165
00:10:07,977 --> 00:10:10,897
The thing about Stanford
is it's a thousand and fifty...

166
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,982
Fifty-three miles from here.

167
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:16,360
I know.

168
00:10:20,823 --> 00:10:24,368
It suddenly seems like the rest
of the school year is coming so fast.

169
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:27,330
Yeah. I wish it would all just stop.

170

- That's Chad's.
- Sure it is.

Now it's just like kindergarten.

Troy? You have guests.

218

Don't make me come up there
and get you again. Hi, Gabriella.

219

We'll be right down, Mom.

220
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,071
She really will come up here
if we don't go down.

Oh, OK.

222
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:02,545
Right there, right there. OK,
come on through. Come on. There you go.

What are you? I mean, who are you?

234
00:15:23,084 --> 00:15:26,504
Good morning, Ms. Evans. I'm Tiara Gold.

235
00:15:26,546 --> 00:15:28,548
I transferred
to East High from London

236
00:15:28,631 --> 00:15:31,926
and I noticed on the board you're
in need of a personal assistant.

237
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:34,887
Yeah, with finals, prom, graduation,

238
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:38,057
I need someone tracking
my appointments and assignments.

239
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,644
Most important, I need someone
to run lines for the musical.

240
00:15:41,727 --> 00:15:46,440
- That's a theater term for...
- Learning your role. I understand.

241
00:15:46,524 --> 00:15:49,193
It's best to keep
science and math books together,

242
00:15:49,235 --> 00:15:51,737
since those are
first lessons of the day.

243
00:15:51,821 --> 00:15:53,698
How do you know my schedule?

244
00:15:53,739 --> 00:15:56,868
I took the liberty of checking,
simply to make certain

245
00:15:56,951 --> 00:16:01,205
I'd have your nonfat, no-foam,
soy latte ready for free period.

246
00:16:01,247 --> 00:16:03,541
- One packet of sweetener?
- Organic.

247
00:16:07,545 --> 00:16:11,841
I'll e-mail you my wardrobe choices each
morning so that our outfits won't clash.

248
00:16:11,924 --> 00:16:14,385
If you own any orange, get rid of it.

249
00:16:17,263 --> 00:16:19,724
By the way, like the accent.

250
00:16:19,765 --> 00:16:22,226
It's... sweet.

251
00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:31,986
Troy, my brother.
Can I have your gym locker?

252
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:34,447
- What?
- Like starting next week.

253
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:38,784
I'll be running the team next season
and it'll help me out with the guys.

254
00:16:38,868 --> 00:16:42,413
- Yeah, why didn't I think of that?
- I don't know.

Are you serious?

258
00:16:48,544 --> 00:16:50,546
What about her... Hey.

00:16:53,382 --> 00:16:56,260
All right, everyone. Settle down.

260
00:16:56,302 --> 00:17:00,014
We are all excited about our Wildcats'

261
00:17:00,097 --> 00:17:04,101
- top-to-bottom championships.
- That would be "back-to-back."

262
00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:07,772
Whatever the case,
it was a grand slam. Well done!

263
00:17:07,855 --> 00:17:11,275
And our student body president
and co-editor of the yearbook,

264
00:17:11,317 --> 00:17:14,278
Taylor McKessie,
has important announcements.

265
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,366
Senior trip committee meets tomorrow
and reports Thursday to prom committee,

266
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:21,077
headed by Martha.
Pick up your tickets from her.

267
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,664
This year's theme is "The Last Waltz."

268
00:17:24,747 --> 00:17:26,666
But don't be last to pick up tickets.

269
00:17:26,749 --> 00:17:30,670
Graduation committee convenes Monday.
Picture deadline is Thursday

270
00:17:30,753 --> 00:17:34,340
and finals study groups alternate
with all of the above. Questions?

271
00:17:34,423 --> 00:17:36,884
What's the lunch special
in the cafeteria?

272
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:41,514
New York deli. Anyone else?

273
00:17:41,597 --> 00:17:47,144
Moving on. Ms. Sharpay Evans, four-term
president of the drama club,

275
00:17:49,021 --> 00:17:52,316
Well, with prom, finals,
everyone is so busy.

276
00:17:52,358 --> 00:17:55,403
I was thinking
I'd select something modest.

277
00:17:55,486 --> 00:17:57,780
Perhaps even a one-woman show.

278
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:03,995
A little light on the sign-ups, Kelsi?

279
00:18:04,036 --> 00:18:07,164
No. We're actually doing pretty well.

280
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:12,670
Well, well, well.
Almost the entire homeroom.

I will happily see all of you
at free period to discuss the show

284
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,848
and to make a very special announcement.

[chattering]

287
00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:43,826
I'll be retaking my finals two or three
times. I'm moving into the library.

288
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,703
I'm working on my truck every day.

289
00:18:45,786 --> 00:18:48,289
I've got five recipes
for Family Science final.

290
00:18:48,372 --> 00:18:50,333
We've got a yearbook to edit, so no.

291
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:54,503
Sorry! Jeez. I thought since it was the
last show, everyone would want to do it.

292
00:18:54,587 --> 00:18:57,882
- You're wrong.
- We just don't have time.

293
00:18:57,965 --> 00:19:02,511
Hey. Hey, you guys, listen up.
Kelsi's right. We should do this.

294
00:19:02,595 --> 00:19:05,348
This is our last chance
to do something together.

295
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:08,017
All of us. Something really fun.

296
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,560
Oh, yippee.

297
00:19:10,603 --> 00:19:13,397
So, what do you say, Wildcats?

298
00:19:13,481 --> 00:19:15,524
No, I still don't think
it's a good idea.

299
00:19:15,608 --> 00:19:18,903
- Guys, come on! It's our senior year!
- Troy.

300
00:19:21,113 --> 00:19:24,700
We're all in this together.
This is our senior year.

301
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:26,285
I'm in.

302
00:19:27,828 --> 00:19:29,080
What?

303
00:19:29,121 --> 00:19:30,915
- It will be fun.
- Yes!

304

- Oh, boy.
- How much time will it take?

305
00:19:34,001 --> 00:19:36,379
Yeah. And what the heck
is the show about?

306
00:19:36,462 --> 00:19:38,089
You, Mr. Danforth.

307
00:19:39,757 --> 00:19:40,716
Me?

308
00:19:43,386 --> 00:19:46,973
The spring musicale is all about you.

309
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,981
Hold up. If it's about me, then
can I have my ball back? Please?

310
00:19:56,691 --> 00:19:58,943
- It's about all of you.
- Go!

311
00:19:59,026 --> 00:20:00,820
And all of you will create it.

00:20:00,903 --> 00:20:06,325
<i>A show about your final days at
East High. We'll call it Senior Year.</i>

313
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:08,286
Genius.

314
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:11,330
Uh-uh-uh! Playing a role is easy,

315
00:20:11,414 --> 00:20:14,166
but being yourself,
now that's a challenge.

316
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,751
Miss Darbus, exactly...

317
00:20:15,835 --> 00:20:18,504
Kelsi will compose,
Ryan will choreograph

318
00:20:18,588 --> 00:20:21,090
- and I will direct.
- Thank you.

319
00:20:21,173 --> 00:20:25,803
Now, I have
some very important news from...

320
00:20:27,346 --> 00:20:30,683
The Juilliard School
in New York City,

321
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:34,478
America's preeminent college
for the performing arts.

322
00:20:34,562 --> 00:20:38,107
And for the first time
in East High history,

323
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,485
Juilliard is considering four of you

324
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:44,322
for one available scholarship.

325
00:20:44,363 --> 00:20:47,408
- Miss Sharpay Evans.
- I'm already packed.

326
00:20:47,491 --> 00:20:50,494
- Mr. Ryan Evans.
- Dance.

327
00:20:50,578 --> 00:20:53,831
- Miss Kelsi Nielsen.
- What? They got my letter?

328
00:20:53,873 --> 00:20:55,416
They certainly did.

329
00:20:55,499 --> 00:20:59,921
And, lastly, Mr. Troy Bolton.

330
00:21:00,004 --> 00:21:02,131
What?

331
00:21:02,215 --> 00:21:07,136
Juilliard will be sending
representatives to observe our show.

332
00:21:09,305 --> 00:21:14,060
So good luck to our four applicants.

333
00:21:14,143 --> 00:21:17,396
Yeah, nice. Nice, guys.
That's pretty funny.

334
00:21:18,648 --> 00:21:21,317
So... who's the big comedian?

335
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,489
- Is there something wrong?
- Yeah. Yeah, I didn't apply.

336
00:21:26,572 --> 00:21:31,077
- I've never heard of Juilliard.
- Well, that may be, Mr. Bolton,

337
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,956
but evidently Juilliard
has heard of you.

338
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,793
And as you create this show,
you must dig deep

339
00:21:38,876 --> 00:21:43,256
and think about your aspirations
and dreams for the future.

340
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:45,091
Line up, downstage, please.

341
00:21:48,678 --> 00:21:52,348
Let's begin with Mr. Danforth.
Step forward, please.

342
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,309
Your future.

343
00:21:55,393 --> 00:21:58,521
It's easy. It's U of A.
Hoops all the way.

344
00:21:58,604 --> 00:22:02,400
- Yeah.
- Miss McKessie.

345
00:22:02,441 --> 00:22:05,361
I'm going to be the President
of the United States.

346
00:22:05,444 --> 00:22:06,445
Oh.

347
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:09,031
I'm going to finish
college first, of course.

348
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:12,034
Martha Cox, you're late.

349
00:22:12,118 --> 00:22:15,413
I'm sorry, I just thought maybe
we could use a few more dancers.

350
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,836
[group gasps, chuckles]

351
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,797
I feel a show coming on already!

352
00:22:33,055 --> 00:22:34,515
Mr. Bolton.

353
00:22:35,808 --> 00:22:37,894
- Mr. Bolton.
- Hmm?

354
00:22:37,977 --> 00:22:41,022
- Your future.
- Oh, yeah, uh...

355
00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:47,486
You know... uh...

356
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,071
I've been thinking about...

357
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:55,786
Uh...

358
00:22:55,828 --> 00:22:59,290
I think we should stage
the perfect prom.

359
00:22:59,373 --> 00:23:03,127
Golly gee, how adorable.
What do I want?

360
00:23:03,211 --> 00:23:06,130
Gosh, I wouldn't know
where to begin.

361
00:23:07,256 --> 00:23:09,300
But I know where it ends.

362
00:23:09,383 --> 00:23:10,968
Center stage.

363
00:23:12,511 --> 00:23:14,138
A single spotlight.

364
00:23:16,557 --> 00:23:20,102
A huge marquee that reads...

365
00:23:33,866 --> 00:23:35,618
New York deli platter, please.

366
00:23:35,701 --> 00:23:39,247
- How can you think about food?
- Maybe because it's lunch time?

367
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,916
No pickles.
Throw that Big Apple parfait in.

368
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:44,460
OK, this show is our last shot, Ryan.

369
00:23:47,129 --> 00:23:50,591
Sharpay's meal, please.
Thanks. That's great.

370
00:23:50,675 --> 00:23:53,636
Troy pretended
to know nothing about Juilliard.

371
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:56,264
- Give me a break.
- He seemed surprised to me.

372
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:59,934
The theater fairy magically
sent in Troy's application?

373
00:24:00,017 --> 00:24:04,021
Performers can't fool me. They're
deceitful, ambitious and ruthless.

374
00:24:04,105 --> 00:24:06,899
- Aren't we performers?
- Exactly.

Wait a minute. Miss D said that
there's only one scholarship.

463
00:28:49,557 --> 00:28:51,309
There's two of us.

464
00:28:51,392 --> 00:28:54,270
We're twins. They're going
to have to take us both.

465
00:28:54,353 --> 00:28:57,982
Listen, Kelsi always writes her
best songs for Troy and Gabriella.

466
00:28:58,024 --> 00:29:01,360
So you make certain we get those songs.

467
00:29:01,444 --> 00:29:02,987
How?

468
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:07,158
Polish her glasses, buy her some
ruby slippers, take her to prom.

469
00:29:07,241 --> 00:29:08,659
I don't know.

470
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:11,078
Just do it.

471
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,049
- Hey, Tay.
- Morning, Sunshine.

472
00:29:23,132 --> 00:29:25,885
- You going to rehearsals today?
- Uh, do I have a choice?

473
00:29:25,968 --> 00:29:29,722
You got us into this. I don't
understand. You might not be here.

474
00:29:29,805 --> 00:29:32,725
Told anyone you're up for
Stanford's Freshman Honors?

475
00:29:32,808 --> 00:29:34,018
No.

476
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,895
You're gonna hear from them any day.

[cell phone rings]

478
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,607
- Hello?
- Taylor, these things take time.

00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:44,028
<i>- Hey.
- [Troy] I need you right away.</i>

<i>- What?
- Look up.</i>

481
00:29:49,867 --> 00:29:51,077
I have to go.

482
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,704
This has two weeks detention
written all over it.

483
00:29:56,123 --> 00:29:57,458
Have fun.

484
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:05,383
I really need your help.

485
00:30:05,466 --> 00:30:07,802
Which one do you think I should wear?

486
00:30:07,885 --> 00:30:10,596
Because?

487
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:15,893
Because you're going to have
a pretty dress, so I want to look right.

488
00:30:15,977 --> 00:30:20,606
I've never been asked to a prom, but
this almost sounds like an invitation.

489
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,024
This one.

490
00:30:27,488 --> 00:30:31,117
I've never been to a dance,
much less a prom.

491
00:30:35,663 --> 00:30:38,541
But I was hoping these
might be a good start.

492
00:30:44,088 --> 00:30:47,425
Do you think we're going
to have to waltz?

493
00:30:47,508 --> 00:30:50,303
Because I have no idea how to do that.

494
00:30:50,386 --> 00:30:53,764
All I know is what my dad
taught me when I was a little girl.

495
00:30:53,806 --> 00:30:57,059
I'd stand on his toes, and he'd
waltz me around the living room.

496
00:30:58,603 --> 00:31:00,438
Come here. I'll show you.

497

- Come here.

It isn't, to you.

Yeah, it's a little hard.

- OK.

I meant Gabriella.

- What?
- Her missing the show

955
00:59:26,033 --> 00:59:30,455
is a little disappointing, but being
selected for Stanford's Honors Program,

956
00:59:30,538 --> 00:59:33,082
that is amazing for her
and for East High.

Hmm...

Come on. This might very well be the
best strawberry in the whole world,

You were right.

So here's the thing.

985
01:01:30,199 --> 01:01:32,118
Your Honors Program at Stanford...

986
01:01:32,201 --> 01:01:36,164
- How did you hear about that?
- A lot of people heard about it.

987
01:01:36,247 --> 01:01:40,209
But I wasn't one of them. Why?

988
01:01:40,251 --> 01:01:42,295
Because I knew what you would say.

989
01:01:42,378 --> 01:01:45,339
Of course you should do
the Honors Program.

990
01:01:45,423 --> 01:01:48,926
Is that what you were trying to tell me?
In the backyard the other day?

991

One of the things.

992
01:01:51,971 --> 01:01:53,347
What else?

993
01:01:53,431 --> 01:01:56,517
I've been thinking about trying
to talk my mom into staying

994
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,271
in Albuquerque another year.
I'll just take some classes here

995
01:02:00,354 --> 01:02:02,940
and go to Stanford when I'm ready.

996
01:02:03,024 --> 01:02:05,902
You can't just put off something
as amazing as Stanford.

997
01:02:07,236 --> 01:02:09,238
You got to go. It's the right thing.

998
01:02:09,322 --> 01:02:13,576
I always do the right thing. Maybe
I want to be a little crazy this time.

999
01:02:13,659 --> 01:02:17,872
Everything about my life has
always been full speed ahead.

1000
01:02:17,914 --> 01:02:21,918
I told you, I wish it
would all just slow down...

1001

To a stop.

1003
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:30,843
That's going to happen.
Nothing is going to slow down.

I guess my heart just doesn't know
it's in high school.

- Shh.

You don't have to say anything else.

I'm a lot better at goodbyes than you.

I've had a ton of practice.

1009

Why are you saying goodbye?

We still have prom.
We still have to graduate.

1011

- You OK?
- Yeah.

1013

1076
01:07:52,415 --> 01:07:53,541
Juilliard.

1077
01:07:56,544 --> 01:07:57,879
There's nothing to tell.

1078
01:07:59,213 --> 01:08:00,840
Maybe there is.

1079
01:08:00,923 --> 01:08:04,594
I heard you're talking to other schools.
I mean, is this serious?

1080
01:08:04,677 --> 01:08:08,097
U of A isn't the only school
that's talked to me. You know that.

1081
01:08:08,139 --> 01:08:10,558
But it's the only school
we talked about.

1082
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,227
Chad would be disappointed
if you changed your mind.

1083
01:08:13,311 --> 01:08:15,021
No, Chad would get over it.

1084

Would you?

1085
01:08:19,025 --> 01:08:22,153
We've been going to U of A games
since you were a little kid.

1086
01:08:22,236 --> 01:08:24,822
You talked about wearing
a Redhawks uniform.

1087
01:08:24,906 --> 01:08:27,950
But I'm not a little kid anymore.

1088
01:08:28,034 --> 01:08:31,245
You raised me to make my own choices
and I need to make them.

There we go.

I figured you'd be the last one
out of the building.

I don't believe this.

So did you.

1221
01:19:42,083 --> 01:19:47,505
You are so crazy, Wildcat.
And what is it with you and trees?

I guess I see things
more clearly from up here.

But I've also chosen theater.

01:37:20,808 --> 01:37:24,812
The University of California,
Berkeley, offers me both.

That's where I'm going
to be attending next fall.

But most of all, I choose the
person who inspires my heart.
