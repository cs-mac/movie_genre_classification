1
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:11,286
Everyone has an angel.

2
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:14,916
A guardian who watches over us.

3
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:18,556
We can't know what form they'll take.

4
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,423
One day, old man.

5
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:25,700
Next day, little girl.

6
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:30,037
But don't let appearances fool you.

7
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:33,334
They can be as fierce as any dragon.

8
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:37,605
Yet they're not here to fight our battles...

9
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:40,842
...but to whisper from our heart...

10
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:43,385
...reminding that it's us.

11
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:48,783
It's every one of us who holds
the power over the worlds we create.

12
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:13,377
No!

13
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:15,481
No.

14
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:08,218
We can deny our angels exist...

15
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:11,253
...convince ourselves they can't be real.

16
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,382
But they show up anyway.

17
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,618
At strange places.

18
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,195
And at strange times.

19
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:23,225
They can speak through any character
we can imagine.

20
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,995
They'll shout through demons
if they have to...

21
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,400
...daring us...

22
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,837
...challenging us to fight.

23
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,296
Female. Age 20.

24
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,432
- You're the father?
- Stepfather.

25
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,272
That's right. We talked on the phone.

26
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,941
Okay, come with me.

27
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,314
We're gonna take her into the theater.

28
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:28,723
Dr. Gorski's gonna want to take a lock
at her. She likes to see all the new girls.

29
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,721
Don't worry, Dad.
Everything's gonna he fine.

30
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,832
I've got everything under control
around here.

31
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,698
Okay? Come on. Follow me.

32
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,881
Sc this is what we call the theater.

33
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,799
Liar!

34
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,767
Oh, girls. Yes, go, go.

35
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,599
Hey. Come here.

36
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,604
Girls. Behave.

37
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:20,141
Break it up. Break it up.
Will you stop them?

38
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,202
Lynn.

39
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,109
Amy.

40
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,716
Sit down.

41
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:27,943
Sit.

42
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:34,283
Anyway.
Sc the girls use this place to he social.

43
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:38,862
Dr. Gorski, she uses it to help them
deal with their issues.

44
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,333
Polish therapy.

45
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:47,333
It's quite a show, watching them act out
who touched them or heat them.

46
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,939
Dr. Gorski seems to think it helps.
I'm not so sure.

47
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,906
But whether it does or doesn't
won't matter much to you.

48
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,671
Once we take care of
a little hit of business...

49
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,372
- ... there won't he any of that for this one.
- Good.

50
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,076
She'll he in paradise,
if you know what I mean.

51
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:07,782
And all of your troubles will he over.
Right?

52
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:13,152
Now, I know we said 1400
on the phone...

53
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,332
I'm taking a really big risk here...

54
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,130
...so it's gonna have to he 2 grand even.

55
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,933
What the hell are you talking about?
We had a deal.

56
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:28,135
Listen, Father,
I'm not gonna tell you what to do.

57
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,679
Clearly you're a man that can take
care of himself.

58
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:35,376
I don't know what you did to this girl.
And, frankly, I don't wanna know.

59
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,647
What are you gonna tell the detectives
when they come around?

60
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,950
They're gonna love her side of the story.

61
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,558
- Yeah.
- Okay.

62
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,558
I'm going to start your music.

63
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,856
You are safe.

64
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,727
It's all safe.

65
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,869
Now relax.

66
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:54,498
And just let go.

67
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,370
Now, here's the other thing:

68
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,411
I don't have a doctor on staff
who does lobotomies.

69
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,980
- What?
- But...

70
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:08,675
...there happens to he one scheduled
to come in in five days.

71
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:11,754
Sc I'll just forge her signature.
I've done it a dozen times.

72
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,413
it's like we talk about.

73
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:15,819
You control this world.

74
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,657
I told the police she lost her mind
when her mother died.

75
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,992
The truth is a little more complicated.

76
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,361
Let the pain go.

77
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,103
Let the hurt go.

78
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,438
Let the guilt go.

79
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,808
What you're imagining right now...

80
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,572
...that world you control?

81
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,807
That place can he as real as any pain.

82
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,974
I don't want her to remember a thing.

83
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:47,113
Don't worry, she won't even remember
her name when I'm done with her.

84
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,474
Stop.

85
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,247
Get that thing away from me.

86
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,080
Get it away from me.

87
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,417
Where is my mind?

88
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,924
And shut off that damn music.

89
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,552
Undo these straps.

90
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,558
Don't forget my ankles.

91
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,628
Hurry.

92
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,599
Is there a problem, Sweet Pea?

93
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,440
This is a joke, right?

94
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,078
Don't you get the point of this?

95
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,012
It's to turn people on.

96
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,715
I get the sexy little schoolgirl.

97
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:59,584
I even get the helpless mental patient,
right? That can he hot.

98
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,315
But what is this?

99
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,426
Lobotomized vegetable?

100
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:08,931
How about something a little more
commercial, for God's sakes?

101
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,399
Sweet Pea,
could you come here, please?

102
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,608
You gotta help me.

103
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,312
I'm the star of the show, remember?

104
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,609
I'll figure something cut.

105
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,417
All right, ladies. Wrap it up.

106
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,384
Sweet Pea, I want you
to meet somebody. This...

107
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:32,579
Oh, don't tell me.

108
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,117
The priest brought you here
from the orphanage.

109
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,261
Heh, heh, heh. Yeah, that's right.

110
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:41,125
The High Roller is coming for her
in five days.

111
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,791
He's gonna, you know,
just do a little flower picking.

112
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,099
Can you do me a favor, honey?

113
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,504
Can you show this little baby doll around,
give her a tour of the establishment?

114
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,168
Blue, please.

115
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,941
You saw the show, okay?
I don't have the time.

116
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:00,577
Let my sister take her.

117
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,252
Rocket.

118
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,225
Show her around, will you, sis?

119
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,994
All right, come on. Let's go.

120
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,126
Don't worry, I don't bite very hard.

121
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,233
Goodbye, my dear.

122
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,667
- Jesus!
- Oh...

123
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,469
You'll get what you deserve
when the High Roller comes!

124
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,340
- Calm down.
- I will not calm down.

125
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,175
- You see what she did? I hope you rot!
- I did. I'm sorry.

126
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,010
This way.

127
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:39,750
You're gonna he okay.
It just takes a little while to get used to.

128
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:43,316
So how'd you become an orphan?

129
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:46,929
Oh, I get it. it's complicated, right?

130
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,158
Well, we all have our stories in here.
Mine's...

131
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,392
...complicated.

132
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,805
These are the rooms
where we take the clients.

133
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:59,773
There's fresh towels
in all the bathrooms and...

134
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,173
Turn that on.

135
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,386
Blue owns the club.

136
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,390
And we, my dear, heh...

137
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:17,688
...are the main attractions. Ta-da.

138
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,592
The club's a front for his business.

139
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,291
Guns, gambling, medications,
special favors.

140
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:29,596
He brings in his clients,
and we gotta make them feel, you know...

141
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,366
...special.

142
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,041
I don't think she's a problem.

143
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,144
- She locked nice.
- She locked stuck-up to me.

144
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,111
No. She's scared.

145
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,374
I feel sorry for her.

146
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,745
Amber, you feel sorry for everyone.

147
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:45,787
Do you remember when you first got here?
Nobody felt sorry for you.

148
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,585
Well, don't get too attached to her, okay?

149
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,488
Blue's saving her for the High Roller.

150
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,625
She's no virgin.

151
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:59,799
Babydoll, that's Amber, Blondie,
and you've met my sister, Sweet Pea.

152
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,235
- Watch yourself.
- Come on, just give her a break.

153
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,567
Yeah, she hasn't done anything
to you guys.

154
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,368
You best friends now?

155
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,773
Will you just let me finish my tour,
please?

156
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,579
Thank you.

157
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,818
Everybody gets a dance, a routine.

158
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,549
We practice, practice, practice,
and the men come and watch us perform.

159
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,717
And if they like what they see...

160
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:29,257
Well, that's why we dance.

161
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,533
Give me that.

162
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,582
Somebody! Help me!

163
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,668
Let her go, pig.

164
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,435
I didn't mean nothing.

165
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,187
Are you okay?

166
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,289
Yeah. Let's just go.

167
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,236
We don't wanna he late.

168
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:25,566
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

169
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:29,907
Two, two, three, four,
arms, six, seven, eight. Stop.

170
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,343
Stop.

171
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,551
Where are you right now?

172
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,179
Are you with us or not?

173
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,090
Sweet Pea, take break.

174
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,020
Yeah.

175
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,865
Babydoll.

176
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,564
Come over here.

177
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,468
Come, come.

178
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,743
Let me lock at you.

179
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,918
Hm.

180
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,782
You seem fit enough.

181
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,320
I'm going to play you some music, okay?

182
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:22,863
I want you to just relax. Feel the music.

183
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:26,459
Open your heart to it. Let it in.

184
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,036
And when you are ready...

185
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,736
...I want you to dance.

186
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:04,574
If you do not dance,
you have no purpose.

187
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:09,770
And we don't keep things here
that have no purpose.

188
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:15,317
You see, your fight for survival
starts right now.

189
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:19,018
You don't want to he judged?
You won't he.

190
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:22,886
You don't think you're strong enough?
You are.

191
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,926
You're afraid. Don't he.

192
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:30,066
You have all the weapons you need.

193
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,565
Now fight.

194
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,126
Again.

195
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:06,691
Stand up

196
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:12,974
You've got to manage

197
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,196
Hello?

198
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,203
- Excuse me, could you help me? I'm...
- Shoes.

199
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:24,844
I'm sorry?

200
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:26,914
Your shoes.

201
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,914
You're tracking snow everywhere.

202
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,022
Oh, I'm sorry. Should I take them off?

203
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,748
That time has passed.

204
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:37,994
What can I do for you?

205
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:40,252
Nothing. I just...

206
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,025
Let me ask it another way:

207
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:44,728
What are you locking for?

208
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,498
A way cut, I guess.

209
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:48,727
You guess?

210
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,306
No, I...

211
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,966
I know.

212
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,074
I need to get out of here.

213
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:59,237
Freedom.

214
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,849
That wasn't so hard, was it?

215
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:04,654
I'm going to help you to he free.

216
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,050
What do I have to do?

217
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,590
These are your weapons.

218
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,965
When you take them,
you begin your journey.

219
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,067
Your journey to freedom.

220
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,350
You will need five items for this journey.

221
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,821
The first is a map.

222
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,927
Then fire, a knife and a key.

223
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,626
You said five things.

224
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:50,460
The fifth thing is a mystery.

225
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:54,101
It is the reason. It is the goal.

226
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:59,873
It will he a deep sacrifice
and a perfect victory.

227
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:06,645
Only you can find it.

228
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,910
And if you do...

229
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,718
...it will set you free.

230
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:18,692
Oh, and one more thing:

231
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,791
Defend yourself.

232
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:27,960
What was that?

233
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,936
Seriously, you're gonna have to
teach me how to dance like that.

234
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:32,472
That was crazy.

235
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:36,203
That was so amazing. I'm, like, shaking.

236
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:41,879
I've never seen Madame Gorski
clap like that before.

237
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,314
Well, get over it.

238
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:44,976
It's nearly lights cut.

239
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,353
She's not easily impressed.

240
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:51,289
She wasn't impressed.
All that gyrating and moaning.

241
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:54,362
The dance should he
more than just titillation.

242
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,592
Mine's personal. It says who I am.

243
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,028
What the heck does yours say?

244
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,365
It says I'm gonna escape from here.

245
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,602
That I'm gonna he free.

246
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,803
Well, send me a postcard from paradise.

247
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,246
Are you really gonna try to escape?

248
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,614
Yeah. Before the High Roller comes.

249
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:18,947
- Can I come?
- Me too.

250
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,992
- Yeah, of course.
- You're not going anywhere, Rocket.

251
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:25,650
I'm gonna do what I wanna do.

252
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:29,196
No one's ever escaped from here.
You know that.

253
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:32,301
Yeah. You know, the last three girls
that tried died.

254
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,267
And the same thing'll happen
to the next fool.

255
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:37,463
Lock, why don't you just
listen to my plan?

256
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,768
Don't wanna hear your plan, okay?

257
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,911
None of us do.

258
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,309
What if it's a good plan?

259
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,977
Then she can go through with it.

260
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:54,953
I'm not letting you get hurt.

261
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:00,087
- I kept us safe through a lot of shit.
- I know you have.

262
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,792
I'm not gonna get hurt.

263
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:07,767
I just can't he here anymore.

264
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,065
And if it is a good plan,
we're both going.

265
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,435
No, we're not.

266
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,074
You're on your own.

267
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,388
Well, I've been on my own before.

268
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,393
Sure you have.

269
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,424
Lock where that got us.

270
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:50,572
Baby saved me from the Cock
the other day.

271
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,580
What?

272
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:59,255
I was working in the kitchen
and he comes in behind me.

273
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:03,256
And he pushes me down
and he gets on top of me...

274
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,587
...and I can't even move.

275
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:11,166
And there she was, just like that.

276
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,194
She had a knife to his throat.

277
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,969
She saved me.

278
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,725
The High Roller comes for me
in three days.

279
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,836
But I'm getting out of here
before he does.

280
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:53,908
Sc if you guys wanna come with me,
this is how I plan to do it.

281
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,574
Well?

282
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,150
Okay.

283
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:08,680
If we can collect all four of these items,
we can he free.

284
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:10,325
Okay.

285
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:11,983
- How do we use them?
- Wait up.

286
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,793
First things first.

287
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:17,364
How do you plan on
getting these things?

288
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:21,368
Well, whoever has the item we need,
we get them to watch me dance.

289
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,165
While we run around
and pick their pockets?

290
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:27,502
- Yeah, that's right.
- But we'd he taking all the risk.

291
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,509
We'd he doing the work
while you prance around with an alibi.

292
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:33,740
No. As long as I'm dancing,
they won't even know you're there.

293
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:40,288
Okay, so the first thing we need
is a map...

294
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:44,891
...to figure out where all the exits are,
where the guards are located.

295
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:47,859
Blue has that in his office.
it's behind his desk.

296
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,327
Right. Good.

297
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,429
Second thing we need
is something to start a fire with...

298
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,968
...as a distraction for when we escape.

299
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,737
Plus, the fire should disable
all the checkpoints.

300
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,709
And the third thing is a knife...

301
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:02,901
...in case we run into trouble.

302
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:04,603
The Cock.

303
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,517
- We can do it.
- Okay.

304
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,408
And the last thing's a key.

305
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:13,584
Blue wears a key around his neck.

306
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:14,916
What door does it open?

307
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,458
It's for all of them, I think.
it's a master key.

308
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,358
This plan is crazy.

309
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,298
There's armed guards everywhere, okay?

310
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,799
And if Blue finds cut, we're dead.

311
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:31,304
It's not gonna he, "Oh, sorry, Blue,
we won't do it again." We'll he dead.

312
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,367
We're already dead.

313
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,250
- I'm in.
- Scam I.

314
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:44,079
Me too.

315
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:50,885
All right.

316
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:55,890
But I'm only doing this because you
guys'd get caught without me, okay?

317
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,623
And if it gets too hairy...

318
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,765
...if I say it's over...

319
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,632
...we stop.

320
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,329
Okay.

321
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:07,435
Okay.

322
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:11,471
I'll get the map.

323
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,651
I went for a walk down the railroad track.

324
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,686
Next thing you know, some...

325
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:24,991
- What do you want?
- She's dancing.

326
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:26,759
Who is dancing?

327
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,097
Your baby doll.

328
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:22,911
One pill makes you larger

329
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,583
One pill makes you larger

330
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:34,218
And one pill makes you small

331
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,144
Baby.

332
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,348
Baby.

333
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:57,043
He's coming.
He's gonna start the briefing.

334
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,976
All right, here's the drill:

335
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,582
The Germans are preparing a report
for the kaiser. it's a map.

336
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:29,416
How do we intercept it?

337
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:33,111
You're gonna cross no man's land,
enter the enemy trenches...

338
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:36,121
...and take the map from
the field commanders bunker...

339
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,419
...before the courier
can reach the zeppelin.

340
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:40,493
Sounds like fun.

341
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,757
Oh, and I've arranged something special
for Amber.

342
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:46,598
Get you out of there when you're done.

343
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,698
Let's go.

344
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,574
German doctors and engineers...

345
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:07,045
...have worked out how to return
their fallen to the front lines.

346
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:11,653
They're using steam power and clockworks
to keep them moving.

347
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:16,386
Sc don't feel had about killing them.

348
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,086
They' re already dead.

349
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:29,569
Remember, ladies:

350
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:31,635
If you don't stand for something...

351
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,304
...you'll fall for anything.

352
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:38,010
Oh, and one last thing:

353
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:41,540
Try and work together.

354
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:26,527
Son of a...

355
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:44,868
Come on, guys. The bunker's this way.

356
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,184
- Cover!
- Rocket!

357
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:06,885
Sweet Pea! Help!

358
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:18,271
Uh. Sweet Pea!

359
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:19,563
Rocket.

360
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,904
Are you okay?

361
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:35,708
It's right here.

362
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:10,445
Rocket. That's enough.

363
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,980
Very good.

364
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,845
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

365
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:38,111
Very good.

366
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,482
Okay, this gives me an idea.

367
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:47,356
What about a private dance
for the Mayor.

368
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:48,552
What?

369
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:51,563
Nothing touchy-feely, just something
to get him wound up.

370
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:53,429
Get him ready to spend some money.

371
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,695
All she has to do
is do what she did just now.

372
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:00,837
That is out of the question.
She is not ready. It is too raw.

373
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,534
Did you just say she's not ready?

374
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,838
She doesn't have a costume.
There is no set.

375
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:08,745
Honey, she doesn't need that bullshit.
She's perfect.

376
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:13,045
Perhaps. But that is not for you to decide,
that is for me to decide.

377
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,245
Oh.

378
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:19,554
It's my show, and I say she's not ready.

379
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:23,893
Clearly, I've offended you,
and I apologize.

380
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:25,556
Thank you.

381
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:27,201
Here's the thing:

382
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,633
This show might he yours...

383
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:34,173
...hut the girls and you...

384
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:37,007
...are mine.

385
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:40,146
Right?

386
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:43,679
You're mine.

387
00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:48,178
And if you need a stronger reminder of that,
you let me know, okay?

388
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:50,953
That won't he necessary.

389
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:55,290
Sc with or without your blessing,
she's gonna he on that stage tomorrow?

390
00:50:58,088 --> 00:51:00,125
- I'll see what I can do.
- Attagirl.

391
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:01,496
All right.

392
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:04,195
You lock fantastic, by the way.

393
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,506
Big show, girls.

394
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:14,138
Thank you.

395
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:16,716
- For what?
- The Cock.

396
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:18,216
- It was nothing.
- Shut up.

397
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,489
No one takes a risk for anyone in here.

398
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,086
Sc thank you.

399
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,283
You're welcome.

400
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:28,957
You got family?

401
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:32,659
No.

402
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,626
Oh, that's right.

403
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:36,964
I forgot, you're an orphan.

404
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,365
Iran away from mine.

405
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:42,835
I thought I was pretty smart
at the time, but...

406
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,536
Sweet Pea followed.

407
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:50,848
Which is crazy, because she never even
had a real problem with Mom and Dad.

408
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:54,411
She just cares about you a lot.

409
00:51:56,513 --> 00:52:00,586
Have you just ever wanted
to just take something hack?

410
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,058
You know, something you said.

411
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,563
Something you did.

412
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:09,866
All the time.

413
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:06,122
Amber?

414
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:07,921
The Mayor comes tonight.

415
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,960
I've never seen him without
a big stogie in his mouth.

416
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:15,160
Ugh. I hate those cigars.
I can never get that stink out of my hair.

417
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:19,773
- What?
- it's you.

418
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:23,444
- You have to get his lighter.
- I'm not doing that.

419
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,580
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

420
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:27,305
Come on, he reasonable.

421
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,451
There's got to he another way,
or someone else who can do it.

422
00:53:31,676 --> 00:53:34,179
He's your client.

423
00:53:35,413 --> 00:53:37,120
Yeah, but what if I screw it up?

424
00:53:37,749 --> 00:53:38,921
You can do this.

425
00:53:40,552 --> 00:53:44,728
Well, he keeps it here, you know.
In his breast pocket.

426
00:53:44,923 --> 00:53:48,564
So then you do the good old
kiss-the-neck...

427
00:53:48,727 --> 00:53:50,297
...it is not nothing.

428
00:53:50,462 --> 00:53:51,702
...reach in...

429
00:53:51,863 --> 00:53:53,308
...and ham...

430
00:53:53,465 --> 00:53:55,172
...you're gold.

431
00:53:56,568 --> 00:53:58,172
Yeah.

432
00:53:58,336 --> 00:54:00,179
Kiss the neck.

433
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:02,349
- He'll like that.
- Heh, heh.

434
00:55:08,073 --> 00:55:10,883
Gentlemen. Welcome.

435
00:55:11,443 --> 00:55:16,153
We have a new girl for you tonight.
Something extra special.

436
00:55:17,716 --> 00:55:19,195
It is a work-in-progress...

437
00:55:19,351 --> 00:55:24,096
...so I apologize in advance
for the raw nature of the performance.

438
00:55:24,256 --> 00:55:25,735
I will say, however...

439
00:55:26,424 --> 00:55:29,405
...that is part of the charm.

440
00:55:29,761 --> 00:55:32,901
It is my pleasure to introduce to you...

441
00:55:33,498 --> 00:55:35,842
...this little baby doll.

442
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:20,221
Okay. This is how it's gonna go.

443
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:22,881
Amber will keep the bird on station.

444
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:26,393
Blondie, you'll operate the 50 cal here
and the 30 down there.

445
00:56:27,786 --> 00:56:32,826
The rest of you, drop into the courtyard
and kill the creatures in your way.

446
00:56:32,991 --> 00:56:37,303
Now, when you reach the nest,
you'll find the baby.

447
00:56:37,462 --> 00:56:39,203
You'll have to slit its throat.

448
00:56:40,198 --> 00:56:43,202
Down inside its neck are two crystals...

449
00:56:43,368 --> 00:56:48,613
...that, when struck together, produce
the most magnificent fire you'll ever see.

450
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:52,081
Amber...

451
00:56:52,544 --> 00:56:53,852
...put us on approach.

452
00:56:54,012 --> 00:56:56,925
Roger that. Starting my run.

453
00:57:17,936 --> 00:57:19,142
Nice.

454
00:57:19,304 --> 00:57:20,977
Remember:

455
00:57:21,339 --> 00:57:24,843
Don't ever write a check with your mouth
you can't cash with your ass.

456
00:57:25,877 --> 00:57:28,289
Oh, yeah, and one more thing.

457
00:57:30,048 --> 00:57:31,721
Don't wake the mother.

458
00:57:51,136 --> 00:57:52,342
Here we go, ladies.

459
00:57:53,538 --> 00:57:58,112
Go! Go! Go!

460
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:39,486
Whoa!

461
01:01:34,759 --> 01:01:36,136
To the castle!

462
01:02:14,198 --> 01:02:15,905
I got an idea.

463
01:02:16,501 --> 01:02:17,605
Hold on!

464
01:02:38,623 --> 01:02:40,500
Take that, you ugly mother.

465
01:02:43,828 --> 01:02:45,205
Amber, where is she?

466
01:02:45,363 --> 01:02:46,865
Check our 6. I don't see her.

467
01:02:48,332 --> 01:02:51,211
Blondie, keep your eyes peeled.

468
01:03:13,024 --> 01:03:15,061
I'll kill yo-

469
01:03:22,233 --> 01:03:23,803
She's all yours, Baby.

470
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,439
I can't believe I did it.

471
01:04:57,595 --> 01:04:59,575
Damn, that girl can dance.

472
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:01,971
See what you can do?

473
01:05:02,667 --> 01:05:04,943
Wow, Amber.

474
01:05:05,536 --> 01:05:07,174
Check it cut.

475
01:05:08,072 --> 01:05:09,312
- Halfway home.
- Yeah.

476
01:05:09,473 --> 01:05:10,918
Let me see it.

477
01:05:13,911 --> 01:05:15,322
- it's just like I said:
- Oh.

478
01:05:15,479 --> 01:05:18,426
You kiss the neck, it works every time.

479
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:22,128
- Good job.
- How'd we do?

480
01:05:22,954 --> 01:05:25,434
Nice. Here.

481
01:05:26,991 --> 01:05:29,938
And he didn't even notice.
No. No idea.

482
01:05:38,135 --> 01:05:39,842
Good work, Amber.

483
01:05:41,072 --> 01:05:42,574
- Thanks, Baby.
Cheers.

484
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:45,084
Cheers.
Cheers?

485
01:05:45,376 --> 01:05:47,151
What are we celebrating?

486
01:05:47,612 --> 01:05:48,682
Huh?

487
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,557
Who should I he congratulating?

488
01:05:51,716 --> 01:05:54,424
It was just Babydoll's first time
on stage.

489
01:05:54,585 --> 01:05:56,121
You know how scary that can he.

490
01:05:56,721 --> 01:05:57,927
Yeah.

491
01:05:58,522 --> 01:06:00,524
The bond of the theater.

492
01:06:02,093 --> 01:06:03,504
Hm?

493
01:06:04,428 --> 01:06:06,635
I mean, what else could it he?

494
01:06:09,233 --> 01:06:13,375
I mean, it's not like any of you
have anything to hide, is it?

495
01:06:13,738 --> 01:06:14,944
No.

496
01:06:15,306 --> 01:06:17,786
It's not like anyone was in my office...

497
01:06:18,409 --> 01:06:20,912
...messing with my shit.

498
01:06:21,612 --> 01:06:25,059
No. it's not like people
are missing things.

499
01:06:25,216 --> 01:06:29,164
You know, small little objects
here and there.

500
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:34,133
No. No, that would he outrageous.
That would he crazy.

501
01:06:34,292 --> 01:06:35,498
Right?

502
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:40,109
Because we have such an obvious
explanation for this exuberance.

503
01:06:40,264 --> 01:06:42,767
It's the fraternity of performers.

504
01:06:42,934 --> 01:06:47,883
It's the adrenaline from
the curtain rising.

505
01:06:49,774 --> 01:06:51,082
Maybe this is my fault.

506
01:06:51,242 --> 01:06:54,655
You know, maybe I've just become
too familiar with you girls.

507
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:56,984
Maybe I need to make an example
of someone.

508
01:06:57,148 --> 01:07:00,595
Re-establish the parameters
of our relationship. What do you think?

509
01:07:00,751 --> 01:07:03,561
Blondie, girls?

510
01:07:07,258 --> 01:07:08,931
And what about you?

511
01:07:09,527 --> 01:07:10,870
Huh?

512
01:07:11,862 --> 01:07:13,603
Oh.

513
01:07:14,732 --> 01:07:16,439
Out of mutual respect.

514
01:07:17,468 --> 01:07:20,745
Well, I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

515
01:07:20,972 --> 01:07:26,081
If I was not about to make a small fortune
on you with the High Roller...

516
01:07:27,144 --> 01:07:29,021
...I would-

517
01:07:34,885 --> 01:07:37,923
It saddens me that I have to
resort to threats with you girls.

518
01:07:38,089 --> 01:07:40,069
I thought we were past that.

519
01:07:40,825 --> 01:07:44,432
I just- I need this bullshit to stop!

520
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:48,169
Out of mutual respect.

521
01:07:48,332 --> 01:07:52,974
Let's get things hack to how they were.

522
01:08:04,615 --> 01:08:06,185
Well...

523
01:08:08,419 --> 01:08:10,092
Sc much for that little experiment.

524
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:13,994
What are you saying?

525
01:08:14,158 --> 01:08:15,933
I'm saying it's over.

526
01:08:16,727 --> 01:08:18,502
Right, Baby?

527
01:08:19,263 --> 01:08:20,298
I don't know.

528
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:22,641
What do you mean, you don't know?

529
01:08:23,601 --> 01:08:24,807
Blue's onto us.

530
01:08:25,136 --> 01:08:26,274
We had a deal.

531
01:08:26,437 --> 01:08:28,644
If I say it's over, it's over.

532
01:08:28,806 --> 01:08:30,979
We're this close, though.
We can't just stop.

533
01:08:31,142 --> 01:08:35,113
Did you not hear Blue?
He knows we're up to something.

534
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:36,519
He knows what we're doing.

535
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,923
If he catches us for real,
it won't he a lecture. You saw him.

536
01:08:40,084 --> 01:08:43,964
Sweet Pea. Rocket is right.
The High Roller comes tomorrow.

537
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:47,534
- If we can just stick with the plan till then-
- No! You're screwed.

538
01:08:50,161 --> 01:08:51,765
We're cut.

539
01:08:53,864 --> 01:08:55,138
Rocket...

540
01:08:56,567 --> 01:08:57,841
...we're cut.

541
01:08:59,403 --> 01:09:01,144
I'm finishing this.

542
01:09:02,039 --> 01:09:04,041
We are all finishing this.

543
01:09:04,208 --> 01:09:07,382
You know it's the only way
we can get out of here.

544
01:09:11,415 --> 01:09:13,486
You're gonna choose her...

545
01:09:14,718 --> 01:09:16,493
...someone you barely know...

546
01:09:16,654 --> 01:09:18,395
...over me?

547
01:09:18,689 --> 01:09:20,862
After all I've sacrificed for you.

548
01:09:23,727 --> 01:09:25,172
I'm sorry.

549
01:10:10,975 --> 01:10:12,249
Blondie?

550
01:10:12,409 --> 01:10:15,015
What are you doing down there?
Are you all right?

551
01:10:15,179 --> 01:10:16,419
I'm sorry, it's nothing.

552
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:18,787
What? What's wrong?
Did someone hurt you?

553
01:10:18,949 --> 01:10:22,692
- No, it's not like that. It's really nothing.
- Clearly...

554
01:10:22,987 --> 01:10:25,399
...it is not nothing.

555
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:27,801
Hey.

556
01:10:28,692 --> 01:10:32,469
You can tell me. I am good listener.

557
01:10:33,464 --> 01:10:35,375
Madame Gorski...

558
01:10:36,133 --> 01:10:37,168
...please.

559
01:10:37,334 --> 01:10:39,211
I know that lock.

560
01:10:40,004 --> 01:10:43,349
You think you're all alone,
and that no one can help you.

561
01:10:44,141 --> 01:10:46,678
There is a way to fix anything.

562
01:10:47,511 --> 01:10:48,990
Now...

563
01:10:49,713 --> 01:10:51,989
...tell me what is wrong, child.

564
01:10:55,753 --> 01:10:56,788
Okay.

565
01:10:59,823 --> 01:11:01,860
Promise you can keep a secret?

566
01:11:02,026 --> 01:11:03,528
- Yes.
Yes.

567
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:24,821
- Where the hell is she?
- I don't know.

568
01:11:24,982 --> 01:11:27,053
We need your music.

569
01:11:29,587 --> 01:11:34,058
You know what, forget it.
No, it's too late. Sweet Pea was right.

570
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:38,339
What are you talking about?
The three of us, we can-

571
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:40,133
I don't think we can do this.

572
01:11:40,998 --> 01:11:44,445
I don't wanna do something stupid
that's gonna put you guys in danger.

573
01:11:45,402 --> 01:11:46,472
I'm sorry.

574
01:11:48,672 --> 01:11:50,845
Hey, we got this far, right?

575
01:11:51,041 --> 01:11:53,851
I mean, that's something
not a lot of people could have done.

576
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,086
How had can the High Roller he,
anyway?

577
01:12:05,422 --> 01:12:08,631
Don't you girls have some work
you should he doing?

578
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,498
- You came to help us.
- No.

579
01:12:12,563 --> 01:12:14,600
I came to keep you
from getting killed.

580
01:12:15,099 --> 01:12:16,237
Thank you.

581
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,936
We don't have a lot of time.

582
01:12:18,102 --> 01:12:21,049
If you're done with the pleasantries,
you got a dance to do.

583
01:12:21,205 --> 01:12:23,879
Amber, radio.

584
01:12:49,967 --> 01:12:52,140
What the hell are you doing?

585
01:13:08,118 --> 01:13:10,496
You're gonna wanna watch this.

586
01:13:24,468 --> 01:13:26,004
Turn off your mind

587
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:29,674
Relax and float downstream

588
01:13:30,908 --> 01:13:33,912
It is not dying

589
01:13:34,611 --> 01:13:38,252
It is not dying

590
01:13:39,083 --> 01:13:40,824
Lay down all thought

591
01:13:40,984 --> 01:13:44,397
Surrender to the void

592
01:13:45,989 --> 01:13:48,936
It is shining

593
01:13:49,593 --> 01:13:52,574
It is shining

594
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:04,209
Ladies, this is what's on
our dance card for tonight.

595
01:14:04,375 --> 01:14:08,346
The bomb, code-named "Kitchen Knife,"
is on a hijacked train.

596
01:14:08,512 --> 01:14:11,356
It is protected by a couple dozen
mechanized gunmen.

597
01:14:11,915 --> 01:14:13,155
The idea is simple:

598
01:14:13,317 --> 01:14:18,096
Take care of the gunmen,
deactivate the bomb, then steal it.

599
01:14:18,255 --> 01:14:22,635
The code numbers for the bomb and the
jetpacks for your escape are in that duffel.

600
01:14:22,826 --> 01:14:24,134
Got if.

601
01:14:24,428 --> 01:14:26,339
Sweet Pea.

602
01:14:26,497 --> 01:14:28,636
I'm glad you changed your mind.

603
01:14:35,038 --> 01:14:37,644
Well, there you have it.

604
01:14:38,075 --> 01:14:41,750
You know, for those who fight for it...

605
01:14:41,912 --> 01:14:46,361
...life has a flavor the sheltered
will never know.

606
01:14:46,884 --> 01:14:49,831
Oh, yeah. One last thing.

607
01:14:50,287 --> 01:14:54,394
The bomb's timer is set to detonate
when it reaches the city.

608
01:14:54,558 --> 01:14:58,700
Sc if I were you, I'd hurry!

609
01:15:35,466 --> 01:15:36,638
Weapons hot, ladies.

610
01:15:37,534 --> 01:15:38,569
Hot.

611
01:15:38,735 --> 01:15:40,476
- Hot.
- Hot.

612
01:15:47,978 --> 01:15:49,855
I've got a lock.

613
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:01,633
Good luck.

614
01:16:14,271 --> 01:16:16,911
- We're down.
Copy that.

615
01:18:58,702 --> 01:19:00,375

Weapon deactivated.

623
01:19:38,341 --> 01:19:39,376
Whoa!

624
01:19:53,190 --> 01:19:56,865
Hurry, Amber.
We gotta get this thing out of here.

625
01:19:57,194 --> 01:19:58,730
On my way.

626
01:20:09,606 --> 01:20:12,018
Please refer to the operations manual.

627

Amber, she's good.

01:20:22,753 --> 01:20:24,391
I'm taking her out.

630
01:20:27,858 --> 01:20:29,531
Guys, it's caught on something.

631
01:20:30,127 --> 01:20:32,937
Hold up. We missed one.

632
01:20:59,422 --> 01:21:02,369

Amber, the bomb's active.

Warning:
Weapon will activate in 45 seconds.

638
01:22:05,322 --> 01:22:06,665
Get free.

639
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:12,003
Whoa!

640
01:22:12,162 --> 01:22:14,005
- Rocket, let's go.

641

Weapon will activate in 25 seconds.

642

It's broke. it's not gonna work.

643
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:22,480
I'm on full burn. We'll go together.

644
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:24,585
It's not gonna carry the both of us.

645
01:22:24,741 --> 01:22:27,517
- We have to try.
- Okay, we'll try.

646
01:22:27,677 --> 01:22:29,679
But you've gotta promise me two things.

647
01:22:29,846 --> 01:22:31,291
Rocket, let's go.

648
01:22:31,448 --> 01:22:34,258
- The first thing is...
- Weapon will activate in 15 seconds.

649
01:22:34,417 --> 01:22:35,760
...don't get mad about this.

650
01:22:35,919 --> 01:22:37,592
About what?

651
01:22:39,122 --> 01:22:40,567
This.

652
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:45,333
Rocket!

653
01:22:58,174 --> 01:23:03,089
Weapon will activate in 10, nine...

654
01:23:03,246 --> 01:23:08,059
..."eight, seven, six...

655
01:23:08,218 --> 01:23:11,358
...five, four...

656
01:23:11,521 --> 01:23:16,266
three, two, one.

657
01:23:52,562 --> 01:23:54,098
The second thing is...

658
01:23:56,866 --> 01:23:58,709
...when you get home...

659
01:24:00,904 --> 01:24:02,383
...when you get free...

660
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:08,446
...you tell Mom I love her.

661
01:24:10,046 --> 01:24:12,526
- I'll tell her.
- Mom.

662
01:24:12,682 --> 01:24:14,320
I promise.

663
01:24:32,302 --> 01:24:33,975
Oh, my.

664
01:24:34,137 --> 01:24:37,812
You, what did you do?
You simple, inbred idiot.

665
01:24:37,974 --> 01:24:40,250
Sir, don't know what happened. I just-

666
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:42,253
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

667
01:24:42,412 --> 01:24:44,756
Get her up. Get her up, CJ!

668
01:24:47,117 --> 01:24:48,824
Yes. Yeah, lock.

669
01:24:48,985 --> 01:24:51,022
I want you to lock at what you did.

670
01:24:51,187 --> 01:24:54,361
Lock at what you did, you hitch!

671
01:24:55,091 --> 01:24:56,434
Amber, sweetheart.

672
01:24:56,593 --> 01:25:00,040
You've got Sweet Pea's slot
in tonight's show. Go get ready.

673
01:25:01,431 --> 01:25:04,640
Go get ready.

674
01:25:06,036 --> 01:25:07,379
Go!

675
01:25:10,373 --> 01:25:12,444
Take her to the closet.

676
01:25:16,679 --> 01:25:18,716
As for you...

677
01:25:20,984 --> 01:25:22,019
...it's Showtime.

678
01:25:42,072 --> 01:25:45,952
The High Roller is here.
I need you to focus for me.

679
01:25:46,109 --> 01:25:48,248
Ah. Thank you.

680
01:25:50,613 --> 01:25:52,058
Girls?

681
01:25:52,215 --> 01:25:57,164
Can you just gather around for a second?
I wanna say a few words.

682
01:25:59,089 --> 01:26:02,127
That's all right.
You can just finish getting her dressed.

683
01:26:02,759 --> 01:26:05,069
Okay. There we go.

684
01:26:05,228 --> 01:26:07,071
Very nice.

685
01:26:08,765 --> 01:26:10,335
All right.

686
01:26:12,836 --> 01:26:16,750
I try to give you all...

687
01:26:17,407 --> 01:26:19,011
...a good life.

688
01:26:19,943 --> 01:26:22,423
I try. I do.

689
01:26:23,346 --> 01:26:27,021
And all I ask for in return is just for...

690
01:26:27,517 --> 01:26:29,224
...respect...

691
01:26:29,853 --> 01:26:31,924
...honesty.

692
01:26:32,088 --> 01:26:33,829
You know- Oh, that's okay, Margaret.

693
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:36,937
A give-and-take relationship.

694
01:26:37,527 --> 01:26:40,371
But it's come to my attention-
it's come to our attention...

695
01:26:40,530 --> 01:26:43,943
...that a few had eggs...

696
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:46,011
...led by one little egg in particular...

697
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:51,313
...have spit in the face
of that generosity...

698
01:26:51,474 --> 01:26:55,217
...and are plotting against me.

699
01:26:56,012 --> 01:26:57,491
Me.

700
01:26:58,715 --> 01:26:59,989
Your friend.

701
01:27:00,817 --> 01:27:02,592
Your protector.

702
01:27:03,319 --> 01:27:05,663
Your employer.

703
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:10,831
Plotting to take from me
my most precious possessions.

704
01:27:10,994 --> 01:27:12,337
Blue, what you doing?

705
01:27:12,862 --> 01:27:16,071
- Hm?
- You got the information. You have won.

706
01:27:16,666 --> 01:27:19,272
This little fantasy of freedom
is all they have.

707
01:27:20,937 --> 01:27:23,850
No, no, no. No one's buying that,
honey. No one's buying that, Vera.

708
01:27:24,941 --> 01:27:27,012
There is nothing you can do to-

709
01:27:27,343 --> 01:27:30,586
- Uh.
- You listen to me, you old whore.

710
01:27:30,747 --> 01:27:35,423
It's too late to play the good guy.
it's far too late.

711
01:27:35,585 --> 01:27:39,897
You're suddenly not aware
of what it is we do here?

712
01:27:40,056 --> 01:27:45,165
I teach them to survive you.

713
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:51,107
- All right.
- I'm sorry! I didn't mean to say anything.

714
01:27:51,267 --> 01:27:52,302
I'm sorry.

715
01:27:52,468 --> 01:27:54,141
No, Blondie.

716
01:27:54,304 --> 01:27:56,580
I didn't mean to.

717
01:27:56,806 --> 01:27:58,479
He said everything would he okay.

718
01:27:59,709 --> 01:28:01,518
Blue, this is a mistake.

719
01:28:01,678 --> 01:28:03,089
Please don't do this, okay?

720
01:28:03,246 --> 01:28:06,955
That's right.
Our dear Blondie came to us...

721
01:28:07,116 --> 01:28:10,495
...desperately trying to help her sisters
off this most dangerous path.

722
01:28:10,653 --> 01:28:12,496
At first, we didn't even believe her.

723
01:28:12,655 --> 01:28:17,729
But after hearing who was involved,
frankly, it started to make sense.

724
01:28:18,328 --> 01:28:20,399
- Right here?
Blue.

725
01:28:22,932 --> 01:28:26,038
Uh-huh. "Map. Fire. "

726
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:32,444
Locks like that chicken was counted
a little before it hatched.

727
01:28:33,943 --> 01:28:36,184
Ain't that right, Amber?

728
01:28:39,515 --> 01:28:42,496
You have anything to say? Anything?

729
01:28:43,519 --> 01:28:46,500
Blue, we didn't- We were still-

730
01:28:46,656 --> 01:28:48,294
You know what, sweetheart?

731
01:28:48,458 --> 01:28:49,994
It's okay.

732
01:28:50,393 --> 01:28:51,963
It's okay.

733
01:28:55,665 --> 01:28:56,700
No!

734
01:28:56,866 --> 01:28:58,504
- Oh, my God!
Okay, calm down.

735
01:28:58,668 --> 01:29:02,377
This will all he over soon
and we can get hack to business as usual.

736
01:29:02,538 --> 01:29:05,109
Blondie, I wanna thank you
for everything you've done.

737
01:29:05,275 --> 01:29:06,583
I am so sorry.

738
01:29:06,743 --> 01:29:09,952
The thing is, we hate snitches, so...

739
01:29:13,516 --> 01:29:15,052
No!

740
01:29:19,355 --> 01:29:21,562
Okay. Here.

741
01:29:21,724 --> 01:29:23,260
I hate guns.

742
01:29:23,426 --> 01:29:26,168
I hope everyone's learned
a valuable lesson here.

743
01:29:26,329 --> 01:29:30,243
Especially you, Madame Gorski.
Get her out of here.

744
01:29:31,768 --> 01:29:35,238
And the rest of you, you got a show to do.
Sc go on, go get them, girls.

745
01:29:35,405 --> 01:29:37,316
Make it count.

746
01:29:53,389 --> 01:29:55,835
I've been thinking a lot...

747
01:29:57,427 --> 01:30:00,601
...about all that money
you're gonna make me.

748
01:30:01,197 --> 01:30:03,734
And you'd think that would
give me pleasure.

749
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:07,006
I mean, I'm in the business of pleasure.

750
01:30:07,937 --> 01:30:10,247
But you know what
it makes me feel like?

751
01:30:10,406 --> 01:30:14,377
I'm gonna he honest with you.
it makes me feel like I'm this little boy...

752
01:30:14,544 --> 01:30:16,683
...sitting in the corner of the sandbox...

753
01:30:16,846 --> 01:30:20,384
...while everybody
gets to play with my toys...

754
01:30:21,784 --> 01:30:23,263
...hut me.

755
01:30:24,153 --> 01:30:25,655
Sc you know what I'm gonna do?

756
01:30:26,422 --> 01:30:29,801
I'm gonna take my toys
and I'm gonna go home.

757
01:30:32,662 --> 01:30:34,835
Oh, is that if?!

758
01:30:35,264 --> 01:30:37,107
Is that all you get?!

759
01:30:37,266 --> 01:30:39,177
Come here!

760
01:30:39,335 --> 01:30:41,246
Come on.

761
01:30:41,971 --> 01:30:45,111
Did you lose your fight? Huh?

762
01:30:45,675 --> 01:30:47,052
No.

763
01:30:48,745 --> 01:30:49,985
I just found it.

764
01:31:01,090 --> 01:31:03,127
You'll never have me.

765
01:31:04,627 --> 01:31:06,106
Even

766
01:31:15,037 --> 01:31:17,483
- Sweet Pea.
- Where's Amber and Blondie?

767
01:31:18,408 --> 01:31:19,751
It's just us now.

768
01:31:20,877 --> 01:31:23,380
We have to go, Sweet Pea. Come on.

769
01:32:01,551 --> 01:32:03,087
- That's it.
- Okay.

770
01:32:28,144 --> 01:32:30,385
- Now what?
- Wait for it.

771
01:32:41,257 --> 01:32:42,600
Came an.

772
01:33:05,882 --> 01:33:07,452
Damn it.

773
01:33:08,918 --> 01:33:10,591
This can't he.

774
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,428
We did everything right.

775
01:33:13,322 --> 01:33:17,793
A map, fire, a knife, a key,
and one thing more.

776
01:33:18,327 --> 01:33:19,772
One thing more.

777
01:33:25,101 --> 01:33:26,637
It's me.

778
01:33:27,169 --> 01:33:28,614
What?

779
01:33:28,771 --> 01:33:31,581
Oh, it's me. Of course it's me.

780
01:33:32,241 --> 01:33:34,585
It's the only way
this ever could have ended.

781
01:33:34,744 --> 01:33:36,348
What do you mean?

782
01:33:39,649 --> 01:33:41,185
I'm saying you go home.

783
01:33:42,018 --> 01:33:44,089
Go home to your family.

784
01:33:44,987 --> 01:33:47,467
You tell your mom what Rocket said.

785
01:33:47,723 --> 01:33:49,532
Make her happy.

786
01:33:51,193 --> 01:33:53,469
Go out and live a normal life...

787
01:33:53,696 --> 01:33:55,141
...love...

788
01:33:55,665 --> 01:33:57,269
...he free.

789
01:33:58,668 --> 01:34:00,773
You have to live for all of us now.

790
01:34:01,270 --> 01:34:04,479
- Baby, no. You can't do that.
- Yes, Sweet Pea.

791
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:06,551
You're the strongest.

792
01:34:06,709 --> 01:34:09,690
You're the only one of us
that ever had a chance out there.

793
01:34:09,845 --> 01:34:12,325
You going home and living,
that's how we win.

794
01:34:12,915 --> 01:34:15,395
It's okay. it's okay. it's better this way.

795
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,090
Now listen.

796
01:34:19,789 --> 01:34:21,496
I'm gonna walk out there...

797
01:34:22,525 --> 01:34:25,301
...and when they come after me,
you go, okay?

798
01:34:26,062 --> 01:34:27,769
There's gotta he another way.

799
01:34:28,531 --> 01:34:30,010
No.

800
01:34:31,167 --> 01:34:32,737
This is right.

801
01:34:35,671 --> 01:34:37,844
This was never my story.

802
01:34:38,641 --> 01:34:40,177
It's yours.

803
01:34:40,610 --> 01:34:42,351
Now, don't screw it up, okay?

804
01:34:47,516 --> 01:34:50,429
You stay off the roads
and you find a bus station, all right?

805
01:34:51,554 --> 01:34:53,295
You're gonna he fine.

806
01:35:18,014 --> 01:35:20,153
Where you going, sweetheart?

807
01:35:30,893 --> 01:35:33,999
I said, where you going?

808
01:35:58,821 --> 01:36:00,425
Jesus.

809
01:36:05,261 --> 01:36:06,706
Did-?

810
01:36:07,697 --> 01:36:09,904
Did you see the way she locked at me?

811
01:36:11,967 --> 01:36:15,210
Just in that last moment. It was like...

812
01:36:23,946 --> 01:36:25,425
Doctor?

813
01:36:25,748 --> 01:36:26,783
Is it done?

814
01:36:26,949 --> 01:36:30,726
Dr. Gorski, what do you know
about this one?

815
01:36:30,886 --> 01:36:33,526
Uh, there was something very peculiar.

816
01:36:33,689 --> 01:36:37,000
Yes. Her mother's death plunged her
into a deep depression.

817
01:36:37,159 --> 01:36:41,039
And then in a fit,
she accidentally killed her sister.

818
01:36:41,197 --> 01:36:42,301
Poor child.

819
01:36:43,265 --> 01:36:48,214
It's a shame I couldn't do more for her.
I wasn't given much time, you see.

820
01:36:48,370 --> 01:36:50,907
Yes, but you recommended
the procedure.

821
01:36:51,073 --> 01:36:52,814
Oh, I'm afraid not.

822
01:36:52,975 --> 01:36:55,353
I will admit she has been
quite a handful.

823
01:36:55,511 --> 01:37:00,392
In just one week here,
she stabbed an orderly, started a fire...

824
01:37:00,549 --> 01:37:03,894
...and helped another patient to escape.

825
01:37:05,454 --> 01:37:08,025
But I don't agree with this solution,
doctor.

826
01:37:08,190 --> 01:37:12,036
But why would you sign for a procedure
you don't agree with?

827
01:37:12,194 --> 01:37:13,537
Well, I-

828
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,377
That is your signature, is it not?

829
01:37:19,969 --> 01:37:22,882
I've been doing this
for quite some time, doctor...

830
01:37:23,038 --> 01:37:26,679
...and to he honest with you, I've wondered
myself whether or not it's right.

831
01:37:26,876 --> 01:37:31,325
And I have seen some tortured souls
in here. Believe me.

832
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:32,720
But this one...

833
01:37:33,616 --> 01:37:35,687
Something in her eyes.

834
01:37:36,051 --> 01:37:38,292
I've never seen anyone that...

835
01:37:39,188 --> 01:37:41,190
it's the way she locked at me.

836
01:37:41,357 --> 01:37:43,598
It's like she wanted me to do it.

837
01:37:48,297 --> 01:37:49,708
I hope it helps her.

838
01:38:33,142 --> 01:38:34,746
Hi.

839
01:38:38,214 --> 01:38:39,921
You remember me?

840
01:38:40,916 --> 01:38:44,386
Listen. Listen, I got a had feeling, okay?

841
01:38:44,553 --> 01:38:45,759
These boys do too.

842
01:38:46,856 --> 01:38:48,858
This is not the way
we should he running this place.

843
01:38:49,024 --> 01:38:51,163
We don't run the place. I run it.

844
01:38:51,327 --> 01:38:53,170
In the chair.

845
01:38:55,431 --> 01:38:56,774
Lock...

846
01:38:58,467 --> 01:38:59,810
...I'm not...

847
01:39:00,536 --> 01:39:03,608
- I'm not hurting these girls anymore.
- I'm not doing this.

848
01:39:03,772 --> 01:39:07,049
Guys, don't do this to me now, please.

849
01:39:07,209 --> 01:39:08,984
I need her in that chair.

850
01:39:10,846 --> 01:39:13,622
Put her in the goddamn chair!

851
01:39:16,585 --> 01:39:18,326
Thank you.

852
01:39:21,924 --> 01:39:23,870
Close the door, please.

853
01:39:29,431 --> 01:39:33,777
What? What is it, you're not here? Huh?

854
01:39:33,936 --> 01:39:37,907
You're not here, you're in paradise?
No, no, no. No, no, no.

855
01:39:38,073 --> 01:39:39,780
No, no, no.

856
01:39:42,478 --> 01:39:44,355
You're still here.

857
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:46,819
You're here with me.

858
01:39:48,384 --> 01:39:50,364
In all this shit.

859
01:39:51,487 --> 01:39:54,366
And you don't go away unless I say so.

860
01:39:55,090 --> 01:39:56,501
Okay?

861
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:12,014
That's not right.

862
01:40:12,474 --> 01:40:14,454
That's not right.

863
01:40:15,044 --> 01:40:17,183
You come hack to me.

864
01:40:20,316 --> 01:40:23,126
- Stop right there. Move away from the girl.
What are you doing?

865
01:40:23,285 --> 01:40:26,459
Aah! Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Wait. Aah!

866
01:40:26,622 --> 01:40:28,659
What in God's name
have you been doing up here?

867
01:40:28,824 --> 01:40:31,464
I wasn't doing anything. Lock at her.

868
01:40:31,627 --> 01:40:34,073
She's gone. Lock at her face!
She's not here.

869
01:40:34,229 --> 01:40:37,267
What do you think I wanna do?
I take care of these girls.

870
01:40:37,433 --> 01:40:40,004
I lock out for them.
These are my girls. Tell them.

871
01:40:40,936 --> 01:40:42,711
Tell them!

872
01:40:42,871 --> 01:40:44,282
Get him out of here.

873
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:47,978
- Now.
- Aah! Wait. Wait, wait, wait! Wait.

874
01:40:48,143 --> 01:40:50,384
It's not me you want, it's her stepfather.

875
01:40:50,546 --> 01:40:54,255
I'll tell you everything. I'll tell you-
I'll tell you about the money.

876
01:40:54,583 --> 01:40:56,859
Just keep going down the hall.

877
01:40:58,053 --> 01:40:59,828
You all right, miss?

878
01:41:04,026 --> 01:41:05,505
Miss?

879
01:41:16,238 --> 01:41:20,380
And finally, this question:

880
01:41:20,843 --> 01:41:24,120
The mystery of whose story it will be...

881
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:27,060
...of who draws the curtain.

882
01:41:27,883 --> 01:41:31,387
Who is it that chooses our steps
in the dance?

883
01:41:32,221 --> 01:41:34,497
Who drives us mad...

884
01:41:35,057 --> 01:41:36,434
...lashes us with whips...

885
01:41:36,592 --> 01:41:40,699
...and crowns us with victory
when we survive the impossible?

886
01:41:41,630 --> 01:41:43,109
Who is it...

887
01:41:44,266 --> 01:41:46,769
...that does all these things?

888
01:41:48,270 --> 01:41:51,649
Bus 22 southbound
to Fort Wayne will now begin loading.

889
01:41:51,807 --> 01:41:54,913
Please have your tickets ready
to show the driver.

890
01:42:09,725 --> 01:42:10,965
Excuse me, miss?

891
01:42:15,230 --> 01:42:17,073
Miss, can we have a word?

892
01:42:17,299 --> 01:42:19,677
Is there a problem, gentlemen?

893
01:42:19,835 --> 01:42:22,645
This doesn't concern you.
I have questions for the lady.

894
01:42:22,805 --> 01:42:25,649
Well, could you make it snappy?
I need to stay on schedule.

895
01:42:25,808 --> 01:42:27,685
- We understand.
- Dc you?

896
01:42:27,843 --> 01:42:30,346
That young woman's been on this bus
since Hartford.

897
01:42:30,512 --> 01:42:34,722
I don't see what she could possibly know
about anything happening around here.

898
01:42:34,883 --> 01:42:36,055
Is that true, miss?

899
01:42:36,218 --> 01:42:40,098
I just let her off to use the restroom.
Mine's not working.

900
01:42:43,725 --> 01:42:47,172
- All right.
Oh, and one more thing.

901
01:42:47,729 --> 01:42:51,575
- She's been a joy the entire journey.
- Yes, I said, all right.

902
01:42:54,002 --> 01:42:57,506
Sorry about the inconvenience, miss.
You have yourself a nice trip now.

903
01:42:57,673 --> 01:42:59,016
It's no problem.

904
01:43:08,984 --> 01:43:12,557
- I don't have a ticket.
- I know. it's okay.

905
01:43:12,721 --> 01:43:16,191
Go find a seat in the hack.
Try and get some sleep.

906
01:43:16,892 --> 01:43:19,304
We got a long way to go.

907
01:43:20,829 --> 01:43:22,069
Thank you.

908
01:43:30,139 --> 01:43:33,985
Who honors those we love
with the very life we live?

909
01:43:34,977 --> 01:43:37,719
Who sends monsters to kill us...

910
01:43:38,113 --> 01:43:41,754
...and at the same time
sings that we'll never die?

911
01:43:42,784 --> 01:43:47,733
Who teaches us what's real
and how to laugh at lies?

912
01:43:48,657 --> 01:43:52,764
Who decides why we live
and what we'll die to defend?

913
01:43:53,428 --> 01:43:55,408
Who chains us?

914
01:43:55,597 --> 01:43:59,101
And who holds the key
that can set us free?

915
01:44:00,733 --> 01:44:02,269
It's you.

916
01:44:02,968 --> 01:44:05,505
You have all the weapons you need.

917
01:44:05,671 --> 01:44:07,014
Now fight.
