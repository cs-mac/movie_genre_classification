1
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:35,328
What are you doing there, fella?

2
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,325
I just cut these.

3
00:01:43,212 --> 00:01:44,456
You better come along with us.

4
00:02:03,532 --> 00:02:05,093
Taking it off here, Boss.

5
00:02:05,773 --> 00:02:07,367
Yeah, take it off, Dragline.

6
00:02:15,374 --> 00:02:17,763
-Wiping it off here, Boss?
-All right, Koko, wipe it off.

7
00:02:18,542 --> 00:02:20,167
Drinking it up here, Boss.

8
00:02:20,814 --> 00:02:22,636
All right, drink it up, Gambler.

9
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:55,977
You eyeballing there, Society?

10
00:02:56,336 --> 00:02:57,613
Checking my yo-yo, Boss.

11
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:10,575
Drag, new-meat bus.

12
00:03:16,498 --> 00:03:18,887
Bunch. Must be half a dozen new-meat.

13
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:23,819
No more than five, for a cold drink.

14
00:04:03,062 --> 00:04:04,818
All right, you men get lined up there.

15
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:08,172
Dogboy, shut them dogs up.

16
00:04:08,662 --> 00:04:10,734
They just smell new-meat, s'all, Boss.

17
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,379
What did they bring us today?

18
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:28,817
Gibson, 507 manslaughter.

19
00:04:29,463 --> 00:04:31,024
Good for a two spot.

20
00:04:31,703 --> 00:04:33,559
It was an accident.
I've never been in trouble before.

21
00:04:33,624 --> 00:04:34,868
You call the Captain, "Captain."

22
00:04:35,224 --> 00:04:38,420
Edgar Potter, 302 and resisting arrest.

23
00:04:39,384 --> 00:04:40,497
One year.

24
00:04:40,825 --> 00:04:42,613
I was trying to keep in
out of the rain.

25
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:46,382
Get the wax out of your ears.
You call the Captain, "Captain."

26
00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:49,455
And you call the rest of us "Boss,"
you hear?

27
00:04:50,585 --> 00:04:53,781
This man is going to make us
proud of him, Mr. Hunnicutt.

28
00:04:55,322 --> 00:04:56,566
Raymond Pratt.

29
00:04:57,434 --> 00:04:58,382
Yes, Captain.

30
00:04:58,746 --> 00:05:00,786
Breaking, entering, and assault.

31
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:02,710
Five spot.

32
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,119
And a seaman.

33
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:07,543
'Spect that should come in real handy
around here, Captain.

34
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:09,080
Maybe.

35
00:05:09,402 --> 00:05:10,963
Lucas Jackson.

36
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:12,182
Here, Captain.

37
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:15,860
Maliciously destroying municipal
property while under the influence.

38
00:05:16,155 --> 00:05:17,584
What was that?

39
00:05:19,515 --> 00:05:21,425
Cutting the heads off
parking meters, Captain.

40
00:05:24,988 --> 00:05:26,549
We ain't never had
one of them before.

41
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,246
Where do you think that's
going to get you?

42
00:05:28,988 --> 00:05:30,743
I guess you could say
I wasn't thinking, Captain.

43
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:36,018
It says here that you did
real good in the war.

44
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:39,186
A Silver Star, Bronze Star,
couple of Purple Hearts...

45
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:43,029
...Sergeant. Then came out
the same way you went in.

46
00:05:43,997 --> 00:05:45,142
Buck Private.

47
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,219
Like I was just passing time,
Captain.

48
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,630
Well, you got yourself
some time now...two years.

49
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,707
Well, hell, that ain't much.

50
00:05:55,774 --> 00:05:58,261
We got a couple of men here
doing 20 spots.

51
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,664
We got one that's got all of it.

52
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:04,828
We got all kinds, and you're
going to fit in real good.

53
00:06:05,471 --> 00:06:08,187
Of course, in case you get
rabbit in your blood...

54
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,308
...and you decide to take off for home,
you get a bonus of some time...

55
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,675
...and a set of leg chains to keep
you slowed down just a little bit.

56
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,509
For your own good,
you'll learn the rules.

57
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,349
It's all up to you.

58
00:06:24,512 --> 00:06:28,985
Now I can be a good guy or I can
be one real mean son of a bitch.

59
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,310
It's all up to you.

60
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:38,491
All right, let's move it.

61
00:06:55,586 --> 00:06:56,569
One at a time. Move it!

62
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:09,945
Them clothes got
laundry numbers on them.

63
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,256
You remember your number and always
wear the ones that has your number.

64
00:07:12,323 --> 00:07:14,429
Any man forgets his number
spends a night in the box.

65
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:16,731
These here spoons
you keep with you.

66
00:07:16,931 --> 00:07:19,037
Any man loses his spoon
spends a night in the box.

67
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:21,305
There's no playing grab-ass
or fighting in the building.

68
00:07:21,636 --> 00:07:24,025
You got a grudge against another man,
you fight him Saturday afternoon.

69
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:27,074
Any man playing grab-ass or fighting in
the building spends a night in the box.

70
00:07:27,556 --> 00:07:30,557
First bell's at five minutes of eight
when you will get in your bunk.

71
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:31,996
Last bell is at eight.

72
00:07:32,261 --> 00:07:34,880
Any man not in his bunk at eight
spends the night in the box.

73
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:37,059
There is no smoking in the prone
position in bed.

74
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:39,678
To smoke you must have both legs
over the side of your bunk.

75
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:42,045
Any man caught smoking
prone in bed...

76
00:07:42,117 --> 00:07:43,230
...spends a night in the box.

77
00:07:43,718 --> 00:07:44,666
You get two sheets.

78
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,821
Every Saturday, you put
the clean sheet on the top...

79
00:07:46,886 --> 00:07:48,195
...the top sheet on the bottom...

80
00:07:48,358 --> 00:07:50,114
...the bottom sheet you turn in
to the laundry boy.

81
00:07:50,438 --> 00:07:52,511
Any man turns in the wrong sheet
spends a night in the box.

82
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:54,748
No one'll sit in the bunks
with dirty pants on.

83
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:57,916
Any man with dirty pants on sitting
on the bunks spends a night in the box.

84
00:07:58,406 --> 00:08:00,992
Any man don't bring back his empty
pop bottle spends a night in the box.

85
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:03,675
Any man loud talking
spends a night in the box.

86
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,559
You got questions, you come to me.

87
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,757
I'm Carr, the floor walker.
I'm responsible for order in here.

88
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,153
Any man don't keep order
spends a night in...

89
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,428
...the box.

90
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,080
I hope you ain't going
to be a hard case.

91
00:08:28,362 --> 00:08:30,500
Ain't but four. What did I tell you?
You owe me a cold drink.

92
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:31,518
I owe you. I owe you.

93
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:40,514
Hey, any of you guys from Connecticut?

94
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:43,466
Forget it.

95
00:08:43,819 --> 00:08:45,248
Wash them up!

96
00:08:46,602 --> 00:08:47,977
Wash them up!

97
00:08:57,322 --> 00:09:00,193
Well, what are you still doing here?
Get at them beans!

98
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,023
Next time you stay out of my place.

99
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:20,012
You try that again
and I'll bounce you off the floor.

100
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,243
Well, man, I didn't know
it was your special seat.

101
00:09:22,574 --> 00:09:24,002
You don't take another man's seat, man.

102
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,860
It wasn't his fault.
Nobody said anything...

103
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:29,129
You better mind you manners, boy.
You're acting like a hillbilly tramp.

104
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:31,175
"Tramp." There you go, Beauty.

105
00:09:31,694 --> 00:09:33,766
Hey, yeah, man, you got
your bull-gang name now.

106
00:09:34,413 --> 00:09:36,486
Yeah, well, it ain't no worse
than some I been called.

107
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:38,379
When I was in the Navy...

108
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:39,395
All you new-meats...

109
00:09:39,694 --> 00:09:42,215
...you're going to have to shape up
fast and hard for this gang.

110
00:09:42,287 --> 00:09:43,531
We got rules here.

111
00:09:43,631 --> 00:09:44,491
In order to learn them...

112
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,828
...you gotta do more work
with your ears than your mouth.

113
00:09:49,295 --> 00:09:50,243
Somebody say something?

114
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,969
No, I didn't say nothing, Boss.

115
00:09:53,871 --> 00:09:54,819
What have we got there?

116
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:56,652
Got a Lucas Jackson.

117
00:09:58,256 --> 00:10:00,492
You don't have a name here
until Dragline gives you one.

118
00:10:01,903 --> 00:10:05,733
Maybe we ought to call it No-Ears.
You don't listen much, do you, boy?

119
00:10:05,776 --> 00:10:07,599
I ain't heard that much
worth listening to.

120
00:10:07,697 --> 00:10:10,086
A lot of guys laying down
a lot of rules and regulations.

121
00:10:13,137 --> 00:10:14,566
New-meat looks like
a poker player, Drag.

122
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:18,026
Yeah, that wouldn't surprise me none.

123
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:19,821
I know you've got five dollars
pocket money.

124
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:22,409
That would buy you a whole fistful
of cards. You in or out?

125
00:10:23,537 --> 00:10:24,486
Out.

126
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,407
First bell.

127
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:49,612
How'd you get that scar?

128
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,888
What scar?

129
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,928
Last bell.

130
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:55,372
Last bell.

131
00:11:25,302 --> 00:11:26,415
Fifty, Boss.

132
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,175
Right, Carr. Fifty.

133
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:40,012
Getting up here, Carr.

134
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:03,379
Get out of my eyeballing seat,
you new-meat dummy.

135
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,987
I'm a salesman. I used to drive
these roads all the time.

136
00:13:38,271 --> 00:13:40,027
Drag, it's going to be
one hot mother today.

137
00:13:41,793 --> 00:13:44,181
Yeah, I reckon the Bear's going
to be walking the road today.

138
00:13:44,512 --> 00:13:46,269
Then I'm lucky I got me a broom.

139
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:50,749
I work on top, real cush job. I would
hate to be down in that ditch today.

140
00:13:51,073 --> 00:13:52,185
We work in a ditch?

141
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:54,741
What's the matter with you?

142
00:13:55,073 --> 00:13:58,106
All your big-time driving around,
you never seen a chain gang before?

143
00:13:58,753 --> 00:14:01,623
I ain't used to hard work, neither.
I always tried to avoid it.

144
00:14:02,114 --> 00:14:04,023
I ain't exactly crazy about it, myself.

145
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:07,387
Well, man, it's going to be
one tough day to learn on.

146
00:14:10,114 --> 00:14:12,121
Why don't you give one of these
new-meat a break...

147
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:13,624
...and let him use your broom today?

148
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:16,671
Oh, hell, Society, I ain't
going down in that ditch.

149
00:14:16,994 --> 00:14:20,028
Well, I sure would appreciate it.
I ain't in too good a shape right now.

150
00:14:20,355 --> 00:14:22,908
Hey, Koko,
you really going to sell your job?

151
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:24,664
Well, Drag, I may have to.

152
00:14:25,635 --> 00:14:27,708
Maybe that Lucas War Hero
would give you your price.

153
00:14:28,036 --> 00:14:29,465
I'll give you 50 cents.

154
00:14:29,796 --> 00:14:33,309
Fifty cents for a sweet job like that?
That's worth at least a buck.

155
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:34,904
I'll make it a dollar.

156
00:14:35,235 --> 00:14:36,184
Dollar's a deal.

157
00:14:40,675 --> 00:14:42,748
Where'd you get that about war hero?

158
00:14:43,076 --> 00:14:44,964
A little birdie told me.

159
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:46,719
Tearing the heads off of...what was it?

160
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,346
Gumball machines?

161
00:14:48,869 --> 00:14:51,257
What kind of thing
is that for a grown man?

162
00:14:52,997 --> 00:14:56,346
You know how it is. Small town.
Not much to do in the evening.

163
00:14:58,277 --> 00:15:00,350
Mostly was just settling an old score.

164
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:19,236
Boss, I made this arrangement
with this man to take his broom.

165
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,469
-You don't understand, I made this deal.
-Get moving.

166
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,877
But I made this arrangement.

167
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,997
Get to work.

168
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:55,037
Better take it easy.
You won't last two hours.

169
00:15:58,282 --> 00:15:59,875
Taking it off here, Boss?

170
00:16:00,202 --> 00:16:02,112
Yeah, Dragline, take it off there.

171
00:16:02,154 --> 00:16:04,326
-Taking it off here, Boss?
-Take it off.

172
00:16:06,282 --> 00:16:07,231
Drinking it up here, Boss?

173
00:16:21,963 --> 00:16:23,240
Man bear-clawed here, Boss!

174
00:16:46,126 --> 00:16:47,108
All right, men.

175
00:16:47,565 --> 00:16:48,994
Let's eat them beans!

176
00:17:04,367 --> 00:17:05,796
Cold drink he don't make it.

177
00:17:08,368 --> 00:17:09,414
He won't.

178
00:17:09,646 --> 00:17:11,556
Hey, Babalugats, got a bet here.

179
00:17:35,505 --> 00:17:38,702
-Boss, drinking it up here.
-Right.

180
00:17:44,114 --> 00:17:45,062
Who's that?

181
00:17:45,746 --> 00:17:46,694
That's Godfrey.

182
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:48,746
The Walking Boss.

183
00:18:01,395 --> 00:18:02,507
Don't he ever talk?

184
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,684
Think he just said somethin'.

185
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:45,870
You owe that fella a cold drink.

186
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:02,035
All right!

187
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:04,821
You, Gibson, step out.

188
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:08,596
Boss Paul says you wasn't
happy with your job.

189
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,513
Says you was complaining.

190
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:13,709
Well, we going to give you
a chance to think about it.

191
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,149
All right.

192
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:16,597
Let's go.

193
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,358
Get them clothes off.

194
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:23,602
First bell.

195
00:20:26,365 --> 00:20:30,675
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard
road finally got to Mr. Lucas War Hero.

196
00:20:31,326 --> 00:20:33,399
I'll be back at it in the morning.
Just need a little nap.

197
00:20:33,726 --> 00:20:36,114
Man, I never thought they'd put him
in the box on his first day.

198
00:20:37,406 --> 00:20:38,836
It was only supposed to be a joke.

199
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:41,875
There ain't no brooms.

200
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,117
Well, can't expect to learn
everything the first day.

201
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:47,476
They've taught him
a very valuable lesson.

202
00:20:49,888 --> 00:20:51,797
You guys sure give him
all night to think about it.

203
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,844
We can't help it if he's square.
Huh, Drag?

204
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:59,645
Of course not. He ain't in the box
because of a joke played on him.

205
00:21:00,288 --> 00:21:02,360
He back-sassed a free man.

206
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:05,561
They got their rules and we
ain't got nothing to do with that.

207
00:21:06,689 --> 00:21:09,885
Probably happen to him sooner or
later anyway, complainer like him.

208
00:21:10,689 --> 00:21:13,405
He's gotta learn the rules,
same as anybody else.

209
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:17,403
Yeah, them poor old bosses need
all the help they can get.

210
00:21:18,689 --> 00:21:19,638
Trying to say something?

211
00:21:25,377 --> 00:21:26,458
Last bell!

212
00:21:27,843 --> 00:21:28,922
Last bell!

213
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,927
One of these days I'm gonna have to
flap me up some dust with it.

214
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:38,746
-Forty-nine and one in the box, Boss.
-Right, Carr, 49 and one in the box.

215
00:22:09,637 --> 00:22:10,880
Putting them on here, Boss.

216
00:22:13,414 --> 00:22:14,843
You see that, you see that?

217
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:16,095
I got eyes, don't I?

218
00:22:16,165 --> 00:22:18,751
How am I not going to see someone
that looks like that?

219
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:23,963
Man, oh, man, look at that.
Look at that!

220
00:22:33,127 --> 00:22:35,200
-Wipin' it off here, Boss.
-Wipe it off.

221
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:45,347
-Taking them off here, Boss?
-All right.

222
00:22:46,376 --> 00:22:48,284
Damn thing's blocking the scenery.

223
00:22:51,817 --> 00:22:54,369
Oh man, I'm dying. I'm dying!

224
00:23:02,153 --> 00:23:03,430
Nice broad.

225
00:23:05,672 --> 00:23:06,621
Great set.

226
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:18,050
Lucille, baby.

227
00:23:27,562 --> 00:23:30,562
Oh man, I'm dying! I'm dying!

228
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:38,056
She ain't got nothing, but...one
safety pin holding that thing on!

229
00:23:39,979 --> 00:23:42,368
Come on, safety pin, pop!

230
00:23:45,452 --> 00:23:46,728
C'mon baby, pop!

231
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,529
Hey, Lord...

232
00:23:51,021 --> 00:23:54,217
...whatever I done, don't strike me
blind for another couple of minutes.

233
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,049
My Lucille.

234
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:02,213
Your Lucille, boy.
Where did you get that?

235
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,450
That's Lucille, you mother-head.

236
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:07,974
Anything so innocent,
and built like that...

237
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:09,895
...just gotta be named Lucille.

238
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,885
Rub it, baby. Clean that car.

239
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,868
Rub...rub...

240
00:24:45,263 --> 00:24:47,173
She don't know what she's doing.

241
00:24:47,825 --> 00:24:50,061
Oh boy, she knows exactly
what she's doing.

242
00:24:50,384 --> 00:24:52,774
She's driving us crazy,
and loving every minute of it!

243
00:24:53,745 --> 00:24:55,982
Shut your mouth about my Lucille.

244
00:25:22,547 --> 00:25:23,824
Shut up, Babalugats.

245
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,522
You leave him alone? He's happy.

246
00:25:25,587 --> 00:25:26,863
Because he's a damn moron!

247
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:55,219
Oh, man, that little Lucille.

248
00:26:55,898 --> 00:26:59,542
She was really a big
lot of little gal, wasn't she?

249
00:27:02,138 --> 00:27:05,968
Did you see how she was just about
popping out of the top of that dress?

250
00:27:06,587 --> 00:27:08,016
Come on, Drag, cut it out.

251
00:27:09,147 --> 00:27:10,576
And down below...

252
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:13,779
...man, that thing
didn't reach no higher than...

253
00:27:17,628 --> 00:27:20,180
She's liable to catch a cold
running around like that.

254
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,689
It was stretched so tight
across her bottom...

255
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,955
...I do believe I saw
one of those seams bust loose.

256
00:27:30,268 --> 00:27:32,178
And the opening got wider...

257
00:27:33,341 --> 00:27:34,584
...and wider...and wider.

258
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:37,938
Forget it, man.

259
00:27:40,349 --> 00:27:41,495
What do you mean, forget it?

260
00:27:42,749 --> 00:27:46,426
Stop beating it into the ground.
You ain't doing nobody no good.

261
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:51,707
Okay, new-meat. You get some sleep.

262
00:27:53,022 --> 00:27:55,062
And save your strength,
'cause you're going to need it.

263
00:27:57,823 --> 00:27:58,771
Tomorrow.

264
00:29:28,357 --> 00:29:29,786
Why don't you just stay down, Luke?

265
00:29:29,861 --> 00:29:31,551
He's just going to
knock you down again, buddy.

266
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:33,470
It's not your fault. He's just too big.

267
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,902
Let him hit you in the nose
and get some blood flowing.

268
00:29:36,037 --> 00:29:37,793
Maybe the bosses'll stop it
before he kills you.

269
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:39,394
I don't want to frighten him.

270
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:40,925
Stay down, Luke.

271
00:29:43,718 --> 00:29:46,587
Stay down, Luke. He's gonna kill you.

272
00:30:27,498 --> 00:30:28,447
Stay down!

273
00:30:45,835 --> 00:30:48,224
Somebody ought to stop this thing.

274
00:31:28,078 --> 00:31:29,158
Stay down.

275
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:30,755
You're beat!

276
00:31:32,686 --> 00:31:34,115
You're going to have to kill me.

277
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:43,568
All right, pass right. Here we go.

278
00:32:43,732 --> 00:32:48,042
King gets a three, queen deuce,
seven pair of savannah's right here.

279
00:32:48,372 --> 00:32:51,242
Deuce gets a four. No hell.
Three gets a big ace.

280
00:32:57,492 --> 00:32:58,440
I call.

281
00:33:09,653 --> 00:33:10,668
Kick a buck.

282
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:11,985
A dollar?

283
00:33:14,933 --> 00:33:16,756
One time.

284
00:33:17,174 --> 00:33:18,668
All right, I'll call.

285
00:33:19,221 --> 00:33:21,327
Hell, if I catch, I'm gonna
burn you out. I call.

286
00:33:22,135 --> 00:33:24,851
King, three, he got a four.
Queen, deuce gets a five.

287
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:26,934
Pair of seven gets a john.

288
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:29,650
And the big ace gets...slop in the face.

289
00:33:31,255 --> 00:33:33,360
Okay, you still do the talking.

290
00:33:34,326 --> 00:33:35,275
Cuter again.

291
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:36,908
I call.

292
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:41,100
Kick a buck.

293
00:33:44,184 --> 00:33:45,776
-What you got?
-Pair of sevens.

294
00:33:45,847 --> 00:33:48,717
I can see that, mother-head.
What have you got in the hole?

295
00:33:50,936 --> 00:33:52,846
He ain't got nothing showing.
Raze his head off.

296
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,189
He's been betting...

297
00:33:54,392 --> 00:33:56,279
All right, why don't you call him.

298
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,238
You've got to see it, Gambler.

299
00:34:00,537 --> 00:34:02,392
I can't. I can't catch a damn thing...

300
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,367
I'm snake-bit. I fold.

301
00:34:06,008 --> 00:34:09,173
King, four, three. You got a nine.
You got a nine. Nothing visible.

302
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:11,921
Pair of sevens and a jack gets a six.

303
00:34:12,698 --> 00:34:14,673
Savannahs, you still a better, man.

304
00:34:22,074 --> 00:34:23,022
Kick a buck.

305
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:24,913
Kick him back a buck!

306
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:27,255
I'll see your buck and back a buck.

307
00:34:29,691 --> 00:34:30,640
Kick a buck.

308
00:34:30,715 --> 00:34:31,609
Damn!

309
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:33,016
Don't look at me, mother-head.

310
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:38,932
What're you going to do, play like
a coconut? You got to call him.

311
00:34:40,092 --> 00:34:42,613
I know he's got a pair of kings.
You don't have to stuff'em up my nose.

312
00:34:42,972 --> 00:34:44,532
Well, you still got to call him, anyway.

313
00:34:46,621 --> 00:34:48,344
The man's got kings. Get your tail out.

314
00:34:52,636 --> 00:34:54,545
You wanna see him? Right there.

315
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:02,451
Nothing. Handful of nothing.

316
00:35:02,782 --> 00:35:05,170
You stupid mullet-head,
he beat you with nothing.

317
00:35:05,757 --> 00:35:09,270
Just like today when he kept
coming back at me. With nothing.

318
00:35:13,503 --> 00:35:15,739
Sometimes nothing
can be a real cool hand.

319
00:35:19,934 --> 00:35:20,883
Move over.

320
00:35:21,502 --> 00:35:23,772
I'm going to sit in here
next to my boy.

321
00:35:25,983 --> 00:35:27,609
Cool Hand Luke.

322
00:35:51,841 --> 00:35:52,823
Hey, Loudmouth!

323
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:56,282
Come on, get up there.
Your mama's waiting for you.

324
00:35:58,626 --> 00:36:00,055
She never leaves me alone!

325
00:36:00,866 --> 00:36:02,654
Be glad you got somebody, kid.

326
00:36:02,945 --> 00:36:04,855
Luke, visitor for you.

327
00:36:38,885 --> 00:36:40,957
-Coming out here, Boss.
-Come out, Luke.

328
00:37:30,472 --> 00:37:31,455
How did you find me?

329
00:37:31,976 --> 00:37:34,529
That Helen...

330
00:37:34,888 --> 00:37:37,125
...she sent your things along
with a note...

331
00:37:37,449 --> 00:37:41,126
...and then John here,
he wrote to the police.

332
00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:47,846
Goin' around here, Boss?

333
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,603
Well, Arletta, I've got to stay here.

334
00:37:57,771 --> 00:38:00,007
I always hoped to see you well-fixed...

335
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:04,643
...have me a crop of grandkids
to fuss around with.

336
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,131
I'd like to oblige you, Arletta, but...

337
00:38:08,331 --> 00:38:10,567
...right off, I just don't know
where to put my hands on 'em.

338
00:38:14,411 --> 00:38:15,687
You know, sometimes...

339
00:38:16,651 --> 00:38:19,205
...I wish people was like dogs, Luke.

340
00:38:21,772 --> 00:38:24,642
Comes a time, a day like when...

341
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:29,121
...the bitch just don't recognize
the pups no more, so...

342
00:38:31,372 --> 00:38:35,683
...she don't have no hopes,
nor love to give her pain.

343
00:38:38,573 --> 00:38:40,166
She just don't give a damn.

344
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:46,562
They letting you smoke here?

345
00:38:47,053 --> 00:38:48,330
Smoking it up here, Boss?

346
00:38:56,654 --> 00:38:57,930
You done your best, Arletta.

347
00:39:01,935 --> 00:39:03,593
What I've done with myself
is my own problem.

348
00:39:03,695 --> 00:39:07,372
Oh, no, it ain't, Luke.
You ain't alone.

349
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:10,251
Everywhere you go, I'm with you.

350
00:39:11,376 --> 00:39:12,652
And John, too.

351
00:39:15,216 --> 00:39:16,972
You never thought maybe
that's a heavy load?

352
00:39:19,856 --> 00:39:23,849
Why, we always thought you
were strong enough to carry it.

353
00:39:25,776 --> 00:39:27,053
Was we wrong?

354
00:39:27,376 --> 00:39:28,325
I don't know.

355
00:39:31,025 --> 00:39:32,367
Well, things are just
never the way...

356
00:39:32,433 --> 00:39:33,710
...they seem, Arletta, you know that.

357
00:39:33,778 --> 00:39:35,206
A man's gotta go his own way.

358
00:39:35,697 --> 00:39:37,127
Guess, I've just got to...

359
00:39:39,058 --> 00:39:40,813
...got to love you and let go.

360
00:39:43,378 --> 00:39:44,010
I guess.

361
00:39:47,058 --> 00:39:49,448
I ain't asking what you're going to do
when you get out because...

362
00:39:49,779 --> 00:39:52,495
...l'll be dead and it don't matter.

363
00:39:56,659 --> 00:39:58,350
You never did want to live forever.

364
00:39:58,419 --> 00:40:00,175
I mean, it wasn't such a hell of a life.

365
00:40:01,778 --> 00:40:04,976
I had me...some high old times.

366
00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:07,048
Your old man, Luke...

367
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:09,932
...he wasn't much good
for sticking around...

368
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,129
...but, dammit, he made me laugh.

369
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:18,737
I would have liked to have known him,
the way you talk about him.

370
00:40:29,941 --> 00:40:31,370
He'd have broke you up.

371
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:49,775
What went wrong?

372
00:40:50,102 --> 00:40:52,339
Nothing. Everything's cool as can be.

373
00:40:55,063 --> 00:40:56,656
Arletta, I tried.

374
00:40:57,783 --> 00:40:58,732
I mean to...

375
00:41:00,823 --> 00:41:02,896
...live always free and
above board like you, but...

376
00:41:04,183 --> 00:41:06,420
...I don't know, I just can't seem
to find any elbow room.

377
00:41:11,544 --> 00:41:13,781
You always had good jobs.

378
00:41:14,743 --> 00:41:17,614
And that girl in Kentucky.

379
00:41:17,945 --> 00:41:20,978
Oh...l'd taken a shine to her.

380
00:41:21,464 --> 00:41:24,978
She sure took off
with that convertible fella.

381
00:41:25,304 --> 00:41:26,581
Well, why not?

382
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:31,541
Idea of marrying got you all,
all bollixed up.

383
00:41:33,626 --> 00:41:35,699
Trying to be respectable.

384
00:41:36,985 --> 00:41:40,183
You was boring the hell
out of all of us.

385
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:51,701
I'm leaving the place to John.

386
00:41:52,027 --> 00:41:52,976
That's good. He earned it.

387
00:41:53,947 --> 00:41:55,377
Ain't nothing to do with it.

388
00:41:59,067 --> 00:42:00,824
I just never gave John...

389
00:42:02,907 --> 00:42:05,625
...the kind of, you know,
feeling that I gave you.

390
00:42:05,948 --> 00:42:09,297
So, I'm going to pay him back now.

391
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:14,161
Don't feel you have to say anything.

392
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:18,738
The way it is, you see...

393
00:42:24,189 --> 00:42:28,346
...sometimes you just
have a feeling for a child...

394
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:31,547
...or else you don't.

395
00:42:33,311 --> 00:42:35,220
With John, I just didn't.

396
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:42,587
I gotta go, Arletta.

397
00:42:44,672 --> 00:42:47,224
Laugh it up, kid.
You, you'll make out.

398
00:42:57,471 --> 00:43:00,668
Uncle Luke, why can't you have chains?

399
00:43:02,912 --> 00:43:04,920
John-Boy, let me tell you something.

400
00:43:04,993 --> 00:43:08,189
You know them chains ain't medals.
You got them for making mistakes.

401
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:12,635
And you make a bad enough mistake,
then you've got to deal with the Man.

402
00:43:13,313 --> 00:43:15,069
And he is one rough old boy.

403
00:43:29,218 --> 00:43:31,128
So long, Arletta. Take care.

404
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,151
You know it, kid.

405
00:43:37,636 --> 00:43:39,391
Now there ain't nothing
to come back for.

406
00:43:46,276 --> 00:43:50,432
"Just a closer walk with Thee.

407
00:43:53,956 --> 00:43:58,430
"Grant it, Jesus, is my plea.

408
00:44:01,796 --> 00:44:06,269
"Daily walking close to Thee.

409
00:44:09,636 --> 00:44:12,834
"Let it be, dear Lord...

410
00:44:13,158 --> 00:44:15,230
"...let it be.

411
00:44:18,438 --> 00:44:22,748
"Through the days of
toil that's near...

412
00:44:25,158 --> 00:44:29,632
"...if I fall, dear Lord, who cares?

413
00:44:33,959 --> 00:44:36,348
"Who but Thee...

414
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:39,232
"...my burden shares?

415
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,432
"None but Thee...

416
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:46,213
"...dear Lord, none but Thee!"

417
00:45:11,242 --> 00:45:13,314
This gang's been doing so good...

418
00:45:14,602 --> 00:45:16,992
...the Captain decided
to give you something special.

419
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:22,567
You've got yourselves
a whole road of tarring to do.

420
00:45:24,682 --> 00:45:26,439
And I want to see you roll it.

421
00:45:32,043 --> 00:45:33,472
Pick up your shovels.

422
00:45:34,123 --> 00:45:35,716
Get with it. Move!

423
00:45:39,244 --> 00:45:41,098
We're sure going to be walking
the road today.

424
00:45:41,164 --> 00:45:42,276
What's the deal?

425
00:45:42,444 --> 00:45:46,121
-Man, you think you been working hard?
-This mother's going to break your back.

426
00:46:26,031 --> 00:46:27,787
Let's move! Let's see those shovels!

427
00:46:32,112 --> 00:46:36,269
Going to twist my arm off if it
don't kill me first. Right, Boss?

428
00:46:44,432 --> 00:46:46,505
Hey, buddy, slow down.

429
00:46:47,313 --> 00:46:48,741
That's a long road.

430
00:46:50,672 --> 00:46:54,185
Well, the man wants speed,
let's just give it to him.

431
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:58,663
Cram it in and break it out.
Yeah. Go hard.

432
00:47:00,433 --> 00:47:02,026
What are we racing for?

433
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,542
Wants speed, let's give it to him.

434
00:47:06,674 --> 00:47:08,431
Use that shovel like it was your spoon.

435
00:47:23,156 --> 00:47:24,749
The man, boy, get the man!

436
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:26,188
Moving it up here, Boss.

437
00:48:04,118 --> 00:48:06,508
Now you tell me, Rabbit,
what's going on here?

438
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:09,872
I don't know, Boss.
Think they're all bear-clawed.

439
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:19,151
They don't know whether
to smile, spit or swallow.

440
00:48:19,799 --> 00:48:22,997
Well, they've never seen
a bull gang before.

441
00:49:35,165 --> 00:49:36,442
Where'd the road go?

442
00:49:37,406 --> 00:49:39,958
That's it. That's the end of it.

443
00:49:40,605 --> 00:49:41,882
Man, there's still daylight.

444
00:49:42,686 --> 00:49:44,114
About two hours left.

445
00:49:45,886 --> 00:49:47,162
What do we do now?

446
00:49:48,765 --> 00:49:49,714
Nothing.

447
00:49:50,526 --> 00:49:53,722
Oh, Luke, you wild, beautiful thing!

448
00:49:54,846 --> 00:49:57,083
You crazy handful of nothing!

449
00:50:17,408 --> 00:50:19,001
"As Carol pressed her lips to him...

450
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:23,642
"...his right hand started a slow
descent down her silken body.

451
00:50:24,609 --> 00:50:27,958
"Desire and fear,
temptation and terror...

452
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:32,285
"...yearning and horror warred
within her beautiful young body."

453
00:50:34,849 --> 00:50:37,402
Have to close those things,
or we'd drown,

454
00:50:37,473 --> 00:50:38,422
but it's suffocating in here.

455
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:40,927
Talk about drowning.

456
00:50:42,049 --> 00:50:43,543
When I was in the navy...

457
00:50:43,617 --> 00:50:46,204
...I was on submarine duty once,
and when you get down there...

458
00:50:46,531 --> 00:50:49,247
Will you tell your story walkin'?
It's too hot.

459
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:01,403
Did you see my skinny little boy
chow tonight?

460
00:51:01,571 --> 00:51:03,327
He's matching you plate for plate.

461
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:06,845
I wasn't feeling good.
I think I got an ulcer or something.

462
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:10,684
He had a bigger spoon. Make you
look like yours had a hole in it.

463
00:51:11,332 --> 00:51:12,281
Come on, Clarence.

464
00:51:12,452 --> 00:51:15,005
What do you mean, Clarence?
You call me a liar?

465
00:51:15,076 --> 00:51:16,025
No, not a liar.

466
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:19,482
You just have a common, likeable
tendency toward exaggeration.

467
00:51:22,533 --> 00:51:25,566
That there's the champion
hog-gutter of this camp.

468
00:51:26,373 --> 00:51:28,446
Well, I've seen him eat
ten chocolate bars...

469
00:51:28,774 --> 00:51:31,326
...and seven cold drinks
in 15 minutes.

470
00:51:32,614 --> 00:51:36,443
He can eat busted bottles and
rusty nails, any damn thing.

471
00:51:36,773 --> 00:51:39,970
If you be so kind to let me cut off
your Yankee head, he'll even eat that.

472
00:51:42,214 --> 00:51:43,491
I can eat 50 eggs.

473
00:51:48,294 --> 00:51:49,571
Nobody can eat 50 eggs.

474
00:51:49,895 --> 00:51:51,171
You just said he could eat anything.

475
00:51:51,494 --> 00:51:52,443
You ever eat 50 eggs?

476
00:51:52,775 --> 00:51:54,531
Nobody ever eat 50 eggs.

477
00:51:54,856 --> 00:51:56,448
Hey, Babalugats! We got a bet here.

478
00:51:57,255 --> 00:52:00,125
My boy says he can eat 50 eggs,
he can eat 50 eggs.

479
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,188
Yeah, but in how long?

480
00:52:02,888 --> 00:52:04,001
In an hour.

481
00:52:04,136 --> 00:52:06,046
Well, I believe I'll take part
in that wager.

482
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:07,489
Two dollars. Right here.

483
00:52:07,816 --> 00:52:09,092
Come on now, let's talk some money.

484
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:11,172
All right, $20. Anything.

485
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:13,252
The syndicate will cover any bet
you want to make.

486
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,400
Koko, get some paper.

487
00:52:14,536 --> 00:52:17,733
Drag, 50 eggs got to weigh
a good six pounds.

488
00:52:18,056 --> 00:52:20,926
Man's gut can't hold that.
They'll swell up and bust him open.

489
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:24,771
All right, get your money up. Now,
Gambler, Dynamite, come on, get it up.

490
00:52:25,097 --> 00:52:27,650
Koko-head's going to take all the money.
Come on, Loudmouth, get it up.

491
00:52:27,785 --> 00:52:29,574
Wait just a minute, now.
How's he gonna eat them?

492
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:32,007
Boiled for 15 minutes.
Eat the whole thing in an hour.

493
00:52:32,299 --> 00:52:34,371
One rule. No throwing up.

494
00:52:34,729 --> 00:52:37,119
He throws up, you forfeit everything.

495
00:52:37,418 --> 00:52:39,971
Now when was the last time
you ever saw my boy throw up?

496
00:52:40,298 --> 00:52:42,208
Now shut your mouth
and give your money to Koko.

497
00:52:48,971 --> 00:52:51,208
Why did you have to say 50 for?

498
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,533
Why couldn't you say 35 or 39.

499
00:52:54,827 --> 00:52:56,289
It seemed a nice round number.

500
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,492
That's money you're talking about.
What's the matter with you?

501
00:53:00,459 --> 00:53:03,013
Yeah, well, it'll be something to do.

502
00:53:09,325 --> 00:53:10,753
-Ten!
-Ten, right!

503
00:53:14,894 --> 00:53:16,322
What did I do?

504
00:53:18,221 --> 00:53:20,293
I stole and I told lies.

505
00:53:22,541 --> 00:53:24,931
But I loved my neighbor. And his wife.

506
00:53:25,901 --> 00:53:26,850
He'll never make it.

507
00:53:29,903 --> 00:53:33,251
What we've got to do is stretch
that little old belly of yours.

508
00:53:34,703 --> 00:53:36,939
Get all this stuff out of the way.
Them eggs's coming down.

509
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:42,830
We've got to get it all in fighting
shape, like a barrage balloon.

510
00:53:47,759 --> 00:53:48,937
Ready...

511
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:51,086
...and go!

512
00:54:01,425 --> 00:54:04,774
Hey, Boss, man needs a brown
bomber and a dose of salts.

513
00:54:11,953 --> 00:54:13,513
You can't do that!

514
00:54:15,825 --> 00:54:18,575
-I want my money back.
-No money back.

515
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,503
Twenty of those pills still won't
make any difference.

516
00:54:31,826 --> 00:54:33,583
What are you worried about?
He can't do it.

517
00:54:34,994 --> 00:54:36,204
What's he doing?

518
00:55:13,557 --> 00:55:16,591
All right, stand back, you pedestrians.
This ain't no automobile accident.

519
00:55:16,662 --> 00:55:17,644
That's all 50?

520
00:55:17,718 --> 00:55:19,955
Move over, losers.
I got money riding here.

521
00:55:22,358 --> 00:55:23,732
All right, I've got it figured out.

522
00:55:23,797 --> 00:55:26,864
If he eats an egg a minute, he's got
ten minutes left to swallow them.

523
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:30,028
Hey, I just got five bucks
from a rodeo outfit.

524
00:55:32,279 --> 00:55:34,668
-Hey, you're peeling his eggs.
-That's right, mister.

525
00:55:35,159 --> 00:55:37,069
He peels his eggs himself.
That's understood.

526
00:55:37,399 --> 00:55:40,017
Now you may be just great
at hanging paper around the big city...

527
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:41,069
...and passing bad checks...

528
00:55:41,399 --> 00:55:43,308
...but us country boys
ain't entirely brainless.

529
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:46,509
When it comes to the law,
nothing is understood.

530
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:48,595
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

531
00:55:48,919 --> 00:55:51,637
Who made what law
about peeling the eggs?

532
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,677
I'm his trainer. I'm the syndicate
covering all bets.

533
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,718
And I'm his official egg-peeler.
That's the law.

534
00:56:02,681 --> 00:56:04,438
Just wait till the hour starts,
that's all.

535
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:06,671
I was banking on the fact
he had to peel 'em.

536
00:56:09,402 --> 00:56:10,416
What's going on?

537
00:56:19,802 --> 00:56:20,914
You ready, Champ?

538
00:56:26,395 --> 00:56:27,507
Ready?

539
00:56:29,179 --> 00:56:30,292
Go!

540
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,092
Two...

541
00:56:35,516 --> 00:56:36,463
...three...

542
00:56:36,603 --> 00:56:38,840
Man, he's going to lose a finger
eating eggs like that.

543
00:56:47,644 --> 00:56:48,854
Twenty-four...

544
00:56:54,397 --> 00:56:55,445
...twenty-five...

545
00:56:55,517 --> 00:56:56,465
Slow down a little.

546
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:02,034
Twenty-six...

547
00:57:05,885 --> 00:57:07,642
Forget it, he's wasting time.

548
00:57:24,926 --> 00:57:25,875
Thirty-two.

549
00:57:30,976 --> 00:57:32,023
Just have 18 more to go...

550
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,174
What's wrong?

551
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,963
-I think he's gonna throw up!
-Oh, no.

552
00:57:36,032 --> 00:57:37,855
-That's it. He's finished.
-C'mon Luke!

553
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:39,001
Eighteen to go.

554
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:42,840
He's finished.

555
00:57:51,808 --> 00:57:54,679
Just like a ripe watermelon
that's about to bust itself open.

556
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:57,246
Your boy's done for, Drag.
I'm putting in my last tenner.

557
00:57:57,569 --> 00:58:00,603
-lt don't look good, Drag.
-Man's gut can't hold more than that.

558
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:12,919
-He's all right, he's all right.
-He's going to make it.

559
00:58:23,715 --> 00:58:26,618
I give you a dollar he don't eat
all 50 eggs, I get two dollars back.

560
00:58:27,012 --> 00:58:28,921
Fixer, you're a sweet old boy.

561
00:58:29,251 --> 00:58:32,448
Better take that dollar and buy yourself
a new spark plug or something.

562
00:58:32,772 --> 00:58:35,161
But as long as you done took a stand...

563
00:58:35,492 --> 00:58:38,361
...why don't you put some money where
your mouth is and not no measly buck!

564
00:58:38,691 --> 00:58:39,968
Well, all I got is 3.75, Drag.

565
00:58:40,293 --> 00:58:41,569
That's a bet, Koko.

566
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:44,794
All right, now the rest of you, I want
to hear from some big-money men.

567
00:58:44,868 --> 00:58:46,210
Where's all the high rollers?

568
00:58:46,533 --> 00:58:50,689
I believe you've got it all, Dragline.
Every cent in the camp is riding.

569
00:59:03,751 --> 00:59:05,660
-What's the time?
-Come on, baby.

570
00:59:06,631 --> 00:59:08,387
Twenty-four minutes to go.

571
00:59:08,775 --> 00:59:12,604
Just let that little old belly sag
and enjoy itself.

572
00:59:25,096 --> 00:59:26,208
Forty-one.

573
00:59:27,015 --> 00:59:31,172
Stay loose, buddy. Just nine more
between you and everlasting glory.

574
00:59:31,495 --> 00:59:34,049
-ls he eating them, Alibi?
-He's chewing. Look at that.

575
00:59:35,144 --> 00:59:37,894
They're pigeon eggs, that's all.
Fish eggs, practically.

576
00:59:38,216 --> 00:59:39,329
How much more time, Carr?

577
00:59:39,657 --> 00:59:40,770
Six minutes to go, Stevie.

578
00:59:42,281 --> 00:59:43,939
Chew, chew, chew!

579
00:59:44,009 --> 00:59:45,122
You're helpin' him chew now!

580
00:59:45,161 --> 00:59:45,793
Oh, no.

581
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:49,566
Forty-two.

582
00:59:52,011 --> 00:59:53,799
Tiny, tiny egg.

583
00:59:59,658 --> 01:00:01,087
Two minutes to time!

584
01:00:09,291 --> 01:00:10,240
Forty-four.

585
01:00:10,539 --> 01:00:13,572
All right, now, get mad
at them damned eggs.

586
01:00:13,867 --> 01:00:14,816
Eat it there, boy.

587
01:00:15,019 --> 01:00:15,913
Chew on it.

588
01:00:16,043 --> 01:00:16,992
Gnaw on it.

589
01:00:22,796 --> 01:00:23,592
Thirty seconds.

590
01:00:24,748 --> 01:00:26,275
You got the last one.

591
01:00:26,476 --> 01:00:28,298
Stuff it down in there. Get it in.

592
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,970
That's the last one in there now, baby.
Chew. Chew.

593
01:00:34,732 --> 01:00:36,642
Ten...nine...eight...

594
01:00:37,613 --> 01:00:40,482
...seven...six...five...

595
01:00:41,453 --> 01:00:43,559
...four...three...two...

596
01:00:44,334 --> 01:00:46,438
...one...zero!

597
01:00:49,582 --> 01:00:51,174
Hold it! He didn't swallow the last.

598
01:00:51,854 --> 01:00:54,091
You think so? Just take a look here.

599
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:56,259
Open that mouth.

600
01:01:11,823 --> 01:01:13,733
Nobody can eat 50 eggs.

601
01:01:32,145 --> 01:01:33,934
Snake in the grass here, Boss!

602
01:01:34,001 --> 01:01:35,375
Get it.

603
01:01:35,473 --> 01:01:37,000
Get it!

604
01:01:52,786 --> 01:01:53,615
Hey, Boss.

605
01:01:54,546 --> 01:01:56,204
Forgot your walking stick?

606
01:02:07,987 --> 01:02:09,417
Man, you sure can shoot.

607
01:02:17,428 --> 01:02:20,146
You gone too far when you mess
with the Man With No Eyes.

608
01:02:20,628 --> 01:02:22,090
You'll be out of here in a little bit.

609
01:02:22,164 --> 01:02:23,790
Why don't you take it a little easy?

610
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:45,419
All right, everybody in the trucks.

611
01:02:53,591 --> 01:02:56,144
Boy, look at Him go! Bam! Bam!

612
01:02:56,792 --> 01:03:00,621
Just knock it off, Luke!
You can't talk about Him that way.

613
01:03:01,272 --> 01:03:03,410
You still believe in that big
bearded Boss up there?

614
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:04,461
You think He's watching us?

615
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:06,068
Get in here!

616
01:03:06,424 --> 01:03:07,831
Ain't you scared?

617
01:03:08,791 --> 01:03:10,385
Ain't you scared of dying?

618
01:03:10,712 --> 01:03:13,266
Dying? Boy, He can have this
little life anytime He wants to.

619
01:03:13,592 --> 01:03:15,348
You hear that? You hear it?

620
01:03:16,312 --> 01:03:19,345
Come on! You're welcome to it,
Old Timer.

621
01:03:20,152 --> 01:03:21,909
Let me know You're up there.
Come on.

622
01:03:22,233 --> 01:03:25,102
Love me, hate me, kill me, anything.
Just let me know it.

623
01:03:29,593 --> 01:03:30,869
Just standing in the rain...

624
01:03:32,154 --> 01:03:33,103
...talking to myself.

625
01:03:38,234 --> 01:03:41,430
Blind Dick is paying back
three and borrowing five.

626
01:03:41,946 --> 01:03:43,026
Next.

627
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:44,471
You borrowing or paying back?

628
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:45,366
Borrowing.

629
01:03:45,914 --> 01:03:49,111
Well, Mr. Cool Hand here is
the soft heart in our loan department.

630
01:03:50,204 --> 01:03:51,152
I just need five, Luke.

631
01:03:54,396 --> 01:03:56,151
I knew you could really
eat all them eggs.

632
01:03:57,276 --> 01:03:58,705
Yeah, well, I didn't.

633
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:04,309
That's my darling Luke.
He grins like a baby...

634
01:04:05,276 --> 01:04:06,704
...but he bites like a 'gator.

635
01:04:07,676 --> 01:04:09,106
I believe I still owe you thirty.

636
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,708
I don't suppose you'd care
to take a check?

637
01:04:19,549 --> 01:04:20,477
For you.

638
01:04:39,198 --> 01:04:40,475
His mother's dead.

639
01:05:30,883 --> 01:05:34,231
"I don't care if it rains or freezes...

640
01:05:34,562 --> 01:05:38,239
"...as long as I got my plastic Jesus...

641
01:05:38,563 --> 01:05:43,036
"...sitting on the dashboard of my car.

642
01:05:46,883 --> 01:05:50,560
"Comes in colors pink and pleasant.

643
01:05:50,884 --> 01:05:54,397
"Glows in the dark
'cause it's iridescent.

644
01:05:55,044 --> 01:05:57,434
"Take it with you...

645
01:05:58,724 --> 01:06:01,594
"...when you travel far.

646
01:06:04,484 --> 01:06:08,162
"Get yourself a sweet Madonna...

647
01:06:08,485 --> 01:06:11,998
"...dressed in rhinestone sittin' on...

648
01:06:12,646 --> 01:06:16,640
"...a pedestal of abalone shell.

649
01:06:19,845 --> 01:06:23,523
"Going 90, I ain't scary...

650
01:06:24,166 --> 01:06:27,680
"...'cause I got the Virgin Mary...

651
01:06:28,007 --> 01:06:29,916
"...assuring me...

652
01:06:30,566 --> 01:06:33,284
"...that I won't go to hell.

653
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:42,276
"Get yourself a sweet Madonna...

654
01:06:42,439 --> 01:06:45,157
"...dressed in rhinestone sittin' on...

655
01:06:45,224 --> 01:06:48,999
"...pedestal of abalone shell.

656
01:06:51,176 --> 01:06:53,893
"Going 90, I ain't scary...

657
01:06:54,473 --> 01:06:58,434
"...'cause I got the Virgin Mary.
assuring me...

658
01:06:58,761 --> 01:07:01,477
"...that I won't go to hell."

659
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,247
Luke, fall out.

660
01:07:31,372 --> 01:07:33,608
When a man's mother dies and...

661
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:37,922
...he gets to thinkin' about her
funeral and paying respects...

662
01:07:38,731 --> 01:07:41,765
...before he knows it,
his mind ain't right.

663
01:07:42,732 --> 01:07:45,285
He's got rabbit in his blood
and he runs.

664
01:07:46,572 --> 01:07:48,482
We're keeping you
off the road for a while.

665
01:07:55,692 --> 01:07:57,765
I'm going to say a prayer
for your ma, Luke.

666
01:08:37,135 --> 01:08:41,293
Sorry, Luke, I'm just doing my job.
You've got to appreciate that.

667
01:08:43,696 --> 01:08:45,769
Calling it your job
don't make it right, Boss.

668
01:10:04,182 --> 01:10:06,898
Ma's in the ground now,
God rest her soul.

669
01:10:08,502 --> 01:10:09,779
You best forget about it, Luke.

670
01:10:11,223 --> 01:10:14,419
Got a day and a half lay-in.
Tomorrow's a holiday.

671
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:07,248
-Happy Fourth of July!
-Same to you!

672
01:11:51,070 --> 01:11:54,103
Break it up. Come on,
you've had your fun.

673
01:11:54,366 --> 01:11:57,182
First bell! Move it, Stevie.

674
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:04,660
What have you got,
another one of them dirty books?

675
01:12:04,991 --> 01:12:08,504
Do yourself a favor. Read this part
that Koko underlined for me.

676
01:12:11,392 --> 01:12:14,588
"She moved her head another inch
while he reached up...

677
01:12:15,552 --> 01:12:17,942
"...and put his left hand on Carol's...

678
01:12:18,912 --> 01:12:20,341
"...as Carol pressed her..."

679
01:12:21,152 --> 01:12:23,062
Oh, I can't stand it!

680
01:12:25,152 --> 01:12:27,390
You're just coming to
the interesting part now.

681
01:12:39,586 --> 01:12:41,822
-I can't hear you.
-"Her trembling body..."

682
01:12:49,474 --> 01:12:52,191
Last bell. Last bell.

683
01:12:54,467 --> 01:12:55,263
Move it.

684
01:12:56,675 --> 01:12:58,268
What's that noise outside?

685
01:13:02,595 --> 01:13:03,544
Man on the fence, Boss!

686
01:13:16,068 --> 01:13:17,017
Wait a minute, damn it!

687
01:13:18,628 --> 01:13:20,384
Come back here! Dammit!

688
01:13:24,996 --> 01:13:28,193
Forty-eight, Boss.
One in the box and one in the bush.

689
01:13:28,836 --> 01:13:32,034
Forty-eight.
One in the box and one in the bush.

690
01:13:54,119 --> 01:13:55,875
Oh, listen to Blue sing!

691
01:13:56,999 --> 01:14:00,195
He's on to him, he says. He's got him.

692
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:02,275
Hell, that dog's running
around in circles.

693
01:14:02,599 --> 01:14:03,712
No, he's on to him.

694
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,752
Captain says for us to wait
till the patrol gets here.

695
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,316
Shoulda waited for me to get him out.

696
01:14:09,385 --> 01:14:11,075
Loose like that he can run him crazy.

697
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:14,118
Didn't even have enough sense to run
from the road like everybody else.

698
01:14:14,441 --> 01:14:16,677
Oh, I'm beat. This ain't my job nohow.

699
01:15:13,964 --> 01:15:15,688
Your dogs are crazy.

700
01:15:17,325 --> 01:15:19,049
He's smarter than a dog. Let's go!

701
01:17:51,704 --> 01:17:52,849
He made it!

702
01:17:55,544 --> 01:17:56,690
Look, Captain!

703
01:17:57,785 --> 01:17:59,214
Look what he done to Blue.

704
01:18:00,665 --> 01:18:01,614
He's dead.

705
01:18:04,665 --> 01:18:06,575
He run himself plumb to death.

706
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,620
Get in line facing the Captain.

707
01:19:23,583 --> 01:19:27,064
You're going to get used to wearing
them chains after a while, Luke...

708
01:19:27,424 --> 01:19:29,944
...but you never stop
listening to them clinking.

709
01:19:31,391 --> 01:19:34,740
'Cause they're going to remind
you of what I've been saying...

710
01:19:35,872 --> 01:19:37,149
...for your own good.

711
01:19:37,985 --> 01:19:39,893
Wish you'd stop being
so good to me, Captain.

712
01:19:44,352 --> 01:19:46,742
Don't you ever talk that way to me.

713
01:19:47,777 --> 01:19:48,726
Never!

714
01:19:48,801 --> 01:19:49,815
Never!

715
01:19:56,834 --> 01:19:59,223
What we've got here is...

716
01:20:00,193 --> 01:20:02,266
...failure to communicate.

717
01:20:03,554 --> 01:20:06,423
Some men you just can't reach.

718
01:20:07,394 --> 01:20:11,867
So you get what we had here last week.
Which is the way he wants it.

719
01:20:12,547 --> 01:20:13,976
Well, he gets it.

720
01:20:16,514 --> 01:20:19,864
I don't like it any more than you men.

721
01:20:28,547 --> 01:20:29,977
Well, lookie here.

722
01:20:31,748 --> 01:20:33,177
I knew they'd get you.

723
01:20:33,796 --> 01:20:35,487
Them chains and a bonus
of a couple of years...

724
01:20:35,556 --> 01:20:38,273
Your running days are over forever, boy.

725
01:20:38,948 --> 01:20:40,672
Hell, I'd like to see you
try to run again.

726
01:20:41,957 --> 01:20:45,186
You know, you getting so you smell
so bad I can track you myself.

727
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:50,273
Yeah, well, that ought to be easy
for a genuine son of a bitch.

728
01:21:02,471 --> 01:21:03,844
What happened. How far did you get?

729
01:21:03,910 --> 01:21:04,990
Shut up and let him eat.

730
01:21:05,959 --> 01:21:07,268
About a mile and a half.

731
01:21:10,278 --> 01:21:11,740
This supermarket parking lot.

732
01:21:11,847 --> 01:21:13,341
Found a car with keys in the ignition.

733
01:21:13,991 --> 01:21:16,991
Hit this red light and this police car
slides up alongside.

734
01:21:19,559 --> 01:21:20,836
Then what did you do?

735
01:21:21,959 --> 01:21:23,236
Waited for that light to change.

736
01:21:25,512 --> 01:21:27,901
This cop kept looking over, wondering
what somebody looks like me...

737
01:21:28,201 --> 01:21:30,917
...dressed in state issue, was doin'
driving a shiny new buggy.

738
01:21:33,576 --> 01:21:35,332
So what did you do?

739
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:38,274
He leaned over and said, "Hey!"

740
01:21:39,241 --> 01:21:41,412
Top flight police work,
that's all there is to it.

741
01:21:41,545 --> 01:21:43,269
Fella's probably a lieutenant by now.

742
01:21:50,602 --> 01:21:53,351
Now, we're just gonna lay low
and build time.

743
01:21:53,482 --> 01:21:55,719
Before you know it,
the heat's going to be off of you.

744
01:21:56,361 --> 01:21:59,112
Everything will be right back
where it was. Right, sweet buddy?

745
01:22:12,075 --> 01:22:14,279
I hear tell you don't believe
in no God, Luke.

746
01:22:15,436 --> 01:22:18,054
I was wondering how come a nice,
clean-cut young fellow like you...

747
01:22:18,603 --> 01:22:20,709
...gets put on the hard road.

748
01:22:21,676 --> 01:22:22,919
Now I reckon I knows.

749
01:22:24,556 --> 01:22:27,905
I've been on the road gang
almost 22 years.

750
01:22:29,164 --> 01:22:31,401
In all that time, I ain't never
killed a white man...

751
01:22:32,845 --> 01:22:34,437
...but I ain't afraid to because...

752
01:22:34,925 --> 01:22:37,642
Excuse me, Boss, don't mean
to interrupt. Caught short here.

753
01:22:38,157 --> 01:22:39,979
So did I. It's okay.

754
01:22:40,685 --> 01:22:42,922
You just go on out there
behind them trees.

755
01:22:43,566 --> 01:22:45,670
Man's gotta have his privacy sometime.

756
01:22:46,637 --> 01:22:49,027
You just keep shaking that bush
so we know you're there.

757
01:22:49,806 --> 01:22:51,716
Just keep shaking that bush.

758
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,045
Shaking it up here, Boss!

759
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,029
Still shaking it, Boss.

760
01:23:29,169 --> 01:23:30,795
I'm shaking it, Boss.

761
01:23:53,971 --> 01:23:55,400
He's gone. Get the dogs.

762
01:24:52,695 --> 01:24:54,288
What you got them on for?

763
01:24:54,616 --> 01:24:55,728
How do you take your pants off?

764
01:24:57,719 --> 01:25:01,069
Best way is to get rid
of them leg irons...

765
01:25:01,336 --> 01:25:02,612
...but you ain't strong enough.

766
01:25:02,935 --> 01:25:04,212
Strong enough for what?

767
01:25:06,137 --> 01:25:07,565
Hell, you couldn't heft an axe.

768
01:25:07,896 --> 01:25:08,692
Can, too.

769
01:25:09,016 --> 01:25:10,773
-I bet you can't.
-Can, too.

770
01:25:12,185 --> 01:25:13,559
Bet you can't.

771
01:25:14,136 --> 01:25:15,729
Well, then, go get it, man.

772
01:25:22,137 --> 01:25:23,249
What's your name, boy?

773
01:25:25,657 --> 01:25:27,730
Aren't you going to take
those stripes off your pants?

774
01:25:29,497 --> 01:25:30,610
You know it, kid.

775
01:25:45,178 --> 01:25:46,935
-You want to see something real funny?
-Yeah?

776
01:25:47,099 --> 01:25:49,172
Well, you go on in there
and you get me...

777
01:25:49,244 --> 01:25:51,415
...chili powder and pepper and the like.

778
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:12,373
You better let me handle that, son.

779
01:26:44,447 --> 01:26:45,724
Here they are.

780
01:26:46,751 --> 01:26:47,515
Thank you, son.

781
01:26:47,584 --> 01:26:48,860
What's the matter with him?

782
01:26:49,503 --> 01:26:50,452
He'll be all right.

783
01:26:57,345 --> 01:27:00,214
Now listen. You're going to
have some fun. You hear that?

784
01:27:00,544 --> 01:27:02,519
Well, you remember how them dogs do
when they come through here...

785
01:27:02,593 --> 01:27:04,381
...so you can tell me about it
someday, okay?

786
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:18,779
My wife hasn't written me for a month.

787
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:22,787
She's probably sick of you.

788
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:31,420
Magazine for you.

789
01:28:35,751 --> 01:28:38,468
Hey, Koko,
who's sending me magazines?

790
01:28:41,351 --> 01:28:42,628
Don't know. It's from Atlanta.

791
01:28:42,952 --> 01:28:43,901
My uncle!

792
01:28:44,711 --> 01:28:47,582
Ain't heard from him in eight years
and now he's sending me magazines!

793
01:28:49,353 --> 01:28:50,945
He must have gone crazy!

794
01:28:55,593 --> 01:28:56,705
Look at that!

795
01:28:57,033 --> 01:28:58,942
-That's Luke?
-Look at that, two of 'em.

796
01:29:01,833 --> 01:29:03,262
What's the writing say?

797
01:29:04,074 --> 01:29:05,502
What's that, that writing say?

798
01:29:05,993 --> 01:29:07,903
"Dear Boys: Playing it cool."

799
01:29:15,595 --> 01:29:17,504
They must be six feet tall.

800
01:29:23,754 --> 01:29:25,031
Look at that!

801
01:29:25,355 --> 01:29:27,242
My baby! We're in here
digging and dying...

802
01:29:27,307 --> 01:29:29,674
...he's out there living and flying.

803
01:29:56,717 --> 01:29:58,147
Koko, will you stop that?

804
01:29:59,116 --> 01:30:00,710
Why don't you try making me?

805
01:30:11,918 --> 01:30:15,114
-Hey, Drag? Let me see the picture.
-What for?

806
01:30:15,598 --> 01:30:17,191
Come on, Drag, let us see the picture.

807
01:30:17,518 --> 01:30:19,493
No, you're just a kid.
What you know about it?

808
01:30:19,566 --> 01:30:21,290
You don't want to see
that dirty picture.

809
01:30:21,999 --> 01:30:23,909
Luke and those broads
and all that booze.

810
01:30:24,495 --> 01:30:25,956
Come on, let me take a look.

811
01:30:25,998 --> 01:30:28,104
It would go to your coconut head.
You're liable to get ideas...

812
01:30:28,175 --> 01:30:29,768
...and pass right out.

813
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:33,510
Now, what you figure it's worth?
A peek at that there picture?

814
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:36,076
A quick look now. I'm not
talking about no memorizing job.

815
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,513
Cold drink.

816
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,750
A coke? One cold drink...

817
01:30:40,081 --> 01:30:43,277
...to feast your starving, fishy,
little eyes on the picture?

818
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,510
A true vision of paradise itself...

819
01:30:45,841 --> 01:30:48,394
...with two of the angels right there
frisking around with my boy?

820
01:30:50,673 --> 01:30:51,949
Okay, it's a deal.

821
01:30:52,401 --> 01:30:54,157
One cold drink, in advance.

822
01:31:08,242 --> 01:31:10,064
One chilly bottle right
in my hot little hand.

823
01:31:10,130 --> 01:31:12,519
That goes for the rest of you
mother-heads, too.

824
01:31:13,298 --> 01:31:14,313
Let me see.

825
01:31:14,547 --> 01:31:15,889
Did you pay?

826
01:31:19,763 --> 01:31:20,875
Come on in there, Wicker Man.

827
01:31:49,206 --> 01:31:53,035
You run one time,
you got yourself a set o' chains.

828
01:31:53,590 --> 01:31:55,662
You run twice,
you get yourself two sets.

829
01:31:57,046 --> 01:31:58,770
You ain't going to need no third set...

830
01:31:58,838 --> 01:32:00,877
...because you're going to get
your mind right.

831
01:32:02,166 --> 01:32:04,239
And I mean "right."

832
01:32:05,846 --> 01:32:07,756
Take a good look at Luke.

833
01:32:10,007 --> 01:32:10,955
Cool Hand Luke.

834
01:32:20,503 --> 01:32:22,358
Easy, easy! Let him breathe!

835
01:32:24,728 --> 01:32:26,800
Oh my poor baby.
They done you real good.

836
01:32:27,608 --> 01:32:29,364
I don't know if you're going
to have the girls chasing you.

837
01:32:29,432 --> 01:32:30,894
I'll get some aspirin.

838
01:32:30,937 --> 01:32:32,016
He should have a doctor.

839
01:32:32,088 --> 01:32:32,851
Ain't you gonna learn?

840
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:35,507
They ain't gonna let no doctor see
what they done.

841
01:32:35,608 --> 01:32:37,680
Get your razor. We'll clean up
some them cuts on his head.

842
01:32:39,448 --> 01:32:42,002
How you feeling, buddy?
How you feeling?

843
01:32:43,129 --> 01:32:45,683
Somebody ought to give him
something cold to drink.

844
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:49,199
-That's my baby.
-Now he's going to be all right.

845
01:32:50,009 --> 01:32:52,727
Hey, Luke, look we got the picture
you sent us. Look here.

846
01:32:58,011 --> 01:32:59,603
You really can pick 'em, Luke.

847
01:32:59,930 --> 01:33:02,167
Come on...tell us.
What were they like?

848
01:33:02,490 --> 01:33:04,083
Can't you wait until he stops bleeding?

849
01:33:04,474 --> 01:33:06,896
-Why don't ya go back to your knitting?
-Oh, knock it off, you guys.

850
01:33:06,971 --> 01:33:09,043
Picture's a phoney.
Cost me a week's pay.

851
01:33:09,370 --> 01:33:10,647
What do you mean, a phoney?

852
01:33:10,971 --> 01:33:12,117
What you talking about, man?

853
01:33:12,188 --> 01:33:14,010
We saw them two women
right here in the picture.

854
01:33:14,651 --> 01:33:16,408
Did you have them both at once?
I mean, together?

855
01:33:16,732 --> 01:33:19,928
Picture's a phoney.
I had it made up for you guys.

856
01:33:20,252 --> 01:33:21,681
What do you mean? We saw it all!

857
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:23,412
You was having a big time, man.

858
01:33:23,516 --> 01:33:24,793
You had it made!

859
01:33:25,052 --> 01:33:27,125
Nothing. Made nothing, had nothing.

860
01:33:27,772 --> 01:33:29,529
Couple of towns, couple of bosses.

861
01:33:30,172 --> 01:33:32,245
I laughed out loud once,
he turned me in.

862
01:33:32,573 --> 01:33:33,521
But I got it here!

863
01:33:33,853 --> 01:33:37,050
Oh, come on! Stop beating it!

864
01:33:38,333 --> 01:33:39,762
Get out there yourself!

865
01:33:41,213 --> 01:33:44,891
Stop feeding off me! Get outa here!

866
01:33:45,022 --> 01:33:46,712
Can't breathe. Give me some air!

867
01:33:53,534 --> 01:33:55,389
Well, he ain't himself,
can't you see that?

868
01:33:55,487 --> 01:33:57,690
He's all beat up. He don't know
what he's sayin'.

869
01:33:59,455 --> 01:34:01,594
All right, come on, break it up.

870
01:34:01,727 --> 01:34:03,221
Now, straighten out that bench.

871
01:34:24,737 --> 01:34:26,144
You were eyeballing.

872
01:34:26,209 --> 01:34:28,729
Can't get your mind on them weeds
if you're eyeballing.

873
01:34:29,377 --> 01:34:31,930
You don't need reasons to kick me, Boss.

874
01:34:37,570 --> 01:34:39,162
First bell. Move it.

875
01:34:44,417 --> 01:34:45,694
He'll never make it.

876
01:34:46,018 --> 01:34:47,131
What are you talking about?

877
01:34:58,467 --> 01:35:01,816
That old box will collapse and fall
apart before old Luke calls it quits.

878
01:35:02,147 --> 01:35:04,220
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.

879
01:35:04,548 --> 01:35:06,140
Well, I don't see
no sign of guts in you.

880
01:35:06,467 --> 01:35:09,021
No. No chains, either.

881
01:35:09,348 --> 01:35:11,420
Big deal paperhanger,
passing two bit checks.

882
01:35:11,747 --> 01:35:14,465
You haven't had much luck playing
follow-the-leader, have you?

883
01:35:20,549 --> 01:35:22,458
You want to spend the night
in the box, too?

884
01:35:27,108 --> 01:35:30,939
Well, here's our champion hog-gut.
Hasn't eaten for four days.

885
01:35:31,270 --> 01:35:34,139
You're going to need a little extra.
Got plenty for you.

886
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:35,550
Now you know the rules.

887
01:35:35,686 --> 01:35:37,824
Got to clean your plate or go back
to the box. Right, Boss?

888
01:35:38,150 --> 01:35:39,098
That's enough, Dogboy.

889
01:35:39,430 --> 01:35:41,340
Oh, man used to free-world food
has got a big appetite.

890
01:35:41,478 --> 01:35:43,747
We're going to stretch that
hog-belly right out?

891
01:37:06,412 --> 01:37:08,321
Well, you made the week, boy.

892
01:37:09,036 --> 01:37:11,906
Now you got a day and a half
to rest up for old Monday.

893
01:37:40,718 --> 01:37:43,108
That ditch is Boss Kean's ditch.

894
01:37:43,759 --> 01:37:45,831
I told him that dirt in it is your dirt.

895
01:37:46,799 --> 01:37:48,709
What's your dirt doing in his ditch?

896
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:51,271
I don't know, Boss.

897
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,156
You better get in there
and get it out, boy.

898
01:38:09,681 --> 01:38:13,030
"We work in the morning
hear the ding-dong ring...

899
01:38:13,842 --> 01:38:17,190
"...go march to the table,
see the same damn thing.

900
01:38:17,842 --> 01:38:21,356
"Well, it's on the table,
a knife, a fork and a pan.

901
01:38:22,001 --> 01:38:25,199
"Say anything about it you
get in trouble with the man.

902
01:38:27,762 --> 01:38:31,276
"That Midnight Special.
Shine a light on me.

903
01:38:31,923 --> 01:38:35,600
"Let the Midnight Special shine
your ever-loving light on me.

904
01:38:37,683 --> 01:38:40,880
"If you ever go to Houston,
boy, you better walk right.

905
01:38:41,203 --> 01:38:45,033
"And you better not stagger,
and you better not fight...

906
01:38:45,684 --> 01:38:47,757
"...Because the sheriff
will arrest you."

907
01:38:48,083 --> 01:38:49,677
Luke, what you think you're doing?

908
01:38:52,564 --> 01:38:55,281
Just getting my dirt out of
Boss Kean's ditch, Boss.

909
01:38:55,604 --> 01:38:58,322
I'm damned if you're going
to put your dirt in my yard.

910
01:38:58,644 --> 01:39:00,433
You hear me?

911
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:01,744
Now let's get it out of here.

912
01:39:43,608 --> 01:39:46,804
I told you to get your dirt out
of Boss Kean's ditch, didn't I?

913
01:39:50,424 --> 01:39:51,536
Yeah, Boss.

914
01:39:51,831 --> 01:39:53,654
Then how come it ain't out?

915
01:39:59,929 --> 01:40:01,685
I don't know, Boss.

916
01:40:02,010 --> 01:40:03,602
You don't know.

917
01:40:26,171 --> 01:40:30,000
"Ain't no grave going
to keep my body down.

918
01:40:31,932 --> 01:40:34,168
"Ain't no grave...

919
01:40:34,491 --> 01:40:37,361
"...going to hold my body down.

920
01:40:39,612 --> 01:40:42,961
"Keep Your mind on me above.

921
01:40:43,773 --> 01:40:47,122
"Keep Your heart full of love.

922
01:40:47,613 --> 01:40:50,962
"Ain't no grave
gonna hold my body down..."

923
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:32,405
What's all this dirt doing in here?

924
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:41,270
I don't know...

925
01:41:51,778 --> 01:41:56,251
"When I was a little bitty baby, my
mamma used to rock me in my cradle.

926
01:41:56,578 --> 01:41:59,927
"In them old cotton fields back home."

927
01:42:02,978 --> 01:42:04,254
Don't, Boss.

928
01:42:04,546 --> 01:42:05,855
Get to work.

929
01:42:06,658 --> 01:42:08,414
Don't, Boss. Don't hit me anymore.

930
01:42:11,618 --> 01:42:13,375
For God's sake, don't hit me anymore.

931
01:42:14,179 --> 01:42:17,856
What was that you said?
What was that name you used, Luke?

932
01:42:19,620 --> 01:42:20,568
Oh, God!

933
01:42:22,979 --> 01:42:23,928
Oh, God!

934
01:42:29,220 --> 01:42:31,773
Oh, God, I pray to God
you don't hit me anymore.

935
01:42:34,821 --> 01:42:37,690
I'll do anything you say,
but I can't take anymore.

936
01:42:38,821 --> 01:42:42,334
-You got your mind right, Luke?
-Yeah...

937
01:42:43,621 --> 01:42:44,734
...mind right.

938
01:42:48,421 --> 01:42:50,331
Oh, I got it right, Boss.

939
01:42:57,862 --> 01:42:59,455
Suppose you was to backslide on us?

940
01:42:59,782 --> 01:43:01,692
Oh, no, I won't, Boss.

941
01:43:02,502 --> 01:43:04,575
Suppose you was to back-sass?

942
01:43:05,062 --> 01:43:07,299
Oh, no, I won't. I won't.
I got my mind right.

943
01:43:15,464 --> 01:43:17,374
You try to run again,
we're going to kill you.

944
01:43:17,864 --> 01:43:19,292
I won't, I won't, Boss.

945
01:43:25,704 --> 01:43:29,861
Go get cleaned up and get yourself
some sleep. Expect you need it.

946
01:43:32,265 --> 01:43:33,541
Come on, son.

947
01:43:35,304 --> 01:43:36,734
Come on up outa there.

948
01:44:37,740 --> 01:44:39,017
I got my mind right.

949
01:45:13,905 --> 01:45:15,016
Where are you?

950
01:45:16,784 --> 01:45:18,214
Where are you now?

951
01:46:03,476 --> 01:46:06,825
-All right. Smoke it up.
-Yes, sir.

952
01:46:08,947 --> 01:46:10,857
Luke, water 'em down.

953
01:46:12,501 --> 01:46:13,547
Yes, Boss.

954
01:46:34,709 --> 01:46:36,619
Luke! Fetch the rifle.

955
01:47:25,114 --> 01:47:26,226
You got him, Boss. You got him.

956
01:47:27,353 --> 01:47:28,630
Go fetch it, Luke.

957
01:47:48,475 --> 01:47:51,193
There he is, Boss.
Deader than hell, but won't let go.

958
01:48:01,276 --> 01:48:03,032
You cut that up for our lunch, Luke.

959
01:48:04,892 --> 01:48:06,649
Yes, Boss Paul.

960
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:53,428
He took the keys off of Dogboy's truck.

961
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,156
He got the keys here, too.

962
01:49:11,842 --> 01:49:14,875
"I'm shaking it here, Boss.
I'm shaking it."

963
01:49:20,801 --> 01:49:22,395
That's my baby, Luke.

964
01:49:25,762 --> 01:49:28,796
"Don't hit me, Boss.
Only don't hit me.

965
01:49:29,762 --> 01:49:31,355
"I'll do whatever you say."

966
01:49:33,603 --> 01:49:36,058
You are an original,
that's what you are.

967
01:49:36,131 --> 01:49:38,717
Those mullet-heads didn't
even know you were fooling.

968
01:49:40,483 --> 01:49:43,932
Fooling them? You can't fool them
about something like that.

969
01:49:44,004 --> 01:49:45,018
They broke me.

970
01:49:46,404 --> 01:49:48,957
But they didn't get my mind right.
Not with no sticks. No, sir.

971
01:49:50,563 --> 01:49:52,800
All that time you were planning
on running again.

972
01:49:54,085 --> 01:49:55,994
Never planned anything in my life.

973
01:50:21,286 --> 01:50:24,003
That's just a little old farm road.
Clean as a whistle.

974
01:50:24,326 --> 01:50:27,522
I worked it a couple times.
We're home free. Come on.

975
01:50:27,847 --> 01:50:28,959
We ain't going nowhere.

976
01:50:29,063 --> 01:50:30,689
Now, what are you talking about, Luke?

977
01:50:31,207 --> 01:50:33,760
We're going by my house and
we're going to have a big meal.

978
01:50:34,087 --> 01:50:38,243
Then I'm going to show you a couple of
farm girls that really know what fun...

979
01:50:39,527 --> 01:50:41,120
And then we're going
to get Koko out of there.

980
01:50:41,447 --> 01:50:44,000
And then the terrible trio
is gonna be complete again.

981
01:50:44,072 --> 01:50:47,237
Man, this old free world ain't going
to know which ear to stand on.

982
01:50:48,327 --> 01:50:51,198
Yeah, well, you and Koko
can handle it without me.

983
01:50:52,457 --> 01:50:54,366
What's you mean, Luke?

984
01:50:54,729 --> 01:50:56,485
I done enough world-shaking
for a while.

985
01:50:56,808 --> 01:50:59,678
You do the rest of it for me.
Send me a postcard about it.

986
01:50:59,913 --> 01:51:01,407
-But Luke...
-Take it easy, Drag.

987
01:51:01,929 --> 01:51:02,878
Where are you going?

988
01:51:03,850 --> 01:51:05,027
Just on my own.

989
01:51:06,409 --> 01:51:08,963
But what am I going to do
all by myself?

990
01:51:11,369 --> 01:51:14,567
Man, if I hadn't lost my head.
I only had a couple of years to do.

991
01:51:15,850 --> 01:51:18,884
But when I saw you tearing down
the road in that truck...

992
01:51:22,090 --> 01:51:23,684
Well, you're right, Luke.

993
01:51:24,971 --> 01:51:26,564
We ought to split up.

994
01:51:27,211 --> 01:51:30,855
And then, and then it will be
safer for the both of us.

995
01:51:35,852 --> 01:51:38,722
Just the same,
you're a good old boy, Luke.

996
01:51:41,931 --> 01:51:43,208
You take care!

997
01:52:38,128 --> 01:52:39,405
Anybody here?

998
01:52:54,449 --> 01:52:56,205
Hey, Old Man. You home tonight?

999
01:53:01,490 --> 01:53:04,360
Can You spare a minute.
It's about time we had a little talk.

1000
01:53:08,690 --> 01:53:10,446
I know I'm a pretty evil fellow...

1001
01:53:11,251 --> 01:53:14,448
...killed people in the war
and got drunk...

1002
01:53:15,251 --> 01:53:17,258
...and chewed up
municipal property and the like.

1003
01:53:17,394 --> 01:53:19,282
I know I got no call to ask for much...

1004
01:53:19,411 --> 01:53:22,444
...but even so, You've got to admit You
ain't dealt me no cards in a long time.

1005
01:53:25,171 --> 01:53:28,368
It's beginning to look like You got
things fixed so I can't never win out.

1006
01:53:30,132 --> 01:53:31,245
Inside, outside, all of them...

1007
01:53:32,755 --> 01:53:36,105
...rules and regulations and bosses.

1008
01:53:36,180 --> 01:53:37,936
You made me like I am.

1009
01:53:38,260 --> 01:53:40,366
Now just where am I supposed to fit in?

1010
01:53:43,252 --> 01:53:45,970
Old Man, I gotta tell You.

1011
01:53:47,734 --> 01:53:49,970
I started out pretty strong and fast.

1012
01:53:54,454 --> 01:53:56,047
But it's beginning to get to me.

1013
01:53:58,933 --> 01:54:00,046
When does it end?

1014
01:54:01,814 --> 01:54:03,408
What do You got in mind for me?

1015
01:54:04,534 --> 01:54:05,963
What do I do now?

1016
01:54:20,536 --> 01:54:21,965
On my knees, asking.

1017
01:54:34,136 --> 01:54:35,730
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1018
01:54:38,137 --> 01:54:40,046
I guess I'm pretty tough
to deal with?

1019
01:54:41,497 --> 01:54:42,926
A hard case.

1020
01:54:46,138 --> 01:54:48,025
Guess I gotta find my own way.

1021
01:55:11,868 --> 01:55:13,460
Is that Your answer, Old Man?

1022
01:55:15,900 --> 01:55:17,810
I guess You're a hard case, too.

1023
01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:25,009
Luke, you all right?

1024
01:55:27,100 --> 01:55:30,777
They got us, boy. They're out there,
thicker than flies.

1025
01:55:31,421 --> 01:55:33,331
Bosses, dogs, sheriffs...

1026
01:55:33,661 --> 01:55:36,530
...more guns than I've ever seen
in my life. You ain't got a chance.

1027
01:55:36,861 --> 01:55:39,415
They caught up with me
right after we split up.

1028
01:55:39,901 --> 01:55:43,251
And they were aiming to kill you.
But I fixed that.

1029
01:55:43,902 --> 01:55:46,771
I got them to promise
if you give up peaceful...

1030
01:55:47,582 --> 01:55:49,655
...they ain't even going
to whip you this time.

1031
01:55:51,422 --> 01:55:53,812
They even going to give us
our same bunks back?

1032
01:55:54,143 --> 01:55:55,898
Sure, why not?

1033
01:55:56,222 --> 01:56:00,217
We only been gone a couple of hours.
They're reasonable men.

1034
01:56:09,183 --> 01:56:10,777
You've got to listen to me.

1035
01:56:12,063 --> 01:56:15,260
All you've got to do is give up...

1036
01:56:15,904 --> 01:56:17,180
...nice and quiet.

1037
01:56:18,464 --> 01:56:20,221
Just play it cool.

1038
01:56:23,104 --> 01:56:24,566
Yeah, like I always do?

1039
01:56:25,121 --> 01:56:26,812
Yeah, just play it...

1040
01:56:54,147 --> 01:56:57,825
"What we got here
is a failure to communicate."

1041
01:57:39,750 --> 01:57:40,699
Go get him.

1042
01:58:16,393 --> 01:58:19,459
You hang on in there, Luke.
You hang on.

1043
01:58:21,514 --> 01:58:24,230
There's going to be some
world-shaking, Luke.

1044
01:58:25,513 --> 01:58:27,423
We're going to send you a postcard.

1045
01:58:29,034 --> 01:58:31,423
You follow me and I'll radio
the emergency clinic to open up.

1046
01:58:31,754 --> 01:58:33,664
I'm taking him to the prison hospital.

1047
01:58:33,866 --> 01:58:35,654
But that's an hour away.
He isn't going to make it.

1048
01:58:35,754 --> 01:58:37,511
Get out of the way. He's ours.

1049
01:59:21,326 --> 01:59:23,333
They took him right down that road.

1050
01:59:23,598 --> 01:59:25,987
-What'd he look like, Drag?
-Yeah, Drag.

1051
01:59:26,478 --> 01:59:28,136
Did he have his eyes open or closed?

1052
01:59:28,238 --> 01:59:30,660
-He was smiling.
-Smiling?!

1053
01:59:32,463 --> 01:59:33,706
That's right. You know...

1054
01:59:35,310 --> 01:59:36,904
...that...Luke smile of his?

1055
01:59:37,679 --> 01:59:39,751
He had it on his face
right to the very end.

1056
01:59:40,239 --> 01:59:41,167
Hell, if they didn't know it 'fore...

1057
01:59:41,231 --> 01:59:43,914
...they could tell right then that they
weren't ever going to beat him.

1058
01:59:45,839 --> 01:59:47,269
That old Luke smile.

1059
01:59:49,551 --> 01:59:53,065
Oh, Luke. He was some boy.

1060
01:59:53,233 --> 01:59:55,207
Cool Hand Luke, hell!

1061
01:59:55,376 --> 01:59:57,449
He's a natural born world-shaker!
