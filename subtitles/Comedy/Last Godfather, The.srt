1
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:50,347
I believe in America.

2
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,217
America has made my fortune

3
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,320
and I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,755
I gave her freedom,
but I taught her

5
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,360
never to dishonor her family.

6
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,461
She found a boyfriend.
Not an Italian.

7
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,902
She went to the movies with him.

8
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,997
She stayed out late.
I didn't protest.

9
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:17,607
Two months ago,
he took her for a drive

10
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,210
with another boyfriend.

11
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,175
They made her drink whiskey,

12
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:26,480
and then they tried
to take advantage of her.

13
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,888
She resisted.

14
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,389
She kept her honor.

15
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:36,152
So they beat her like an animal.

16
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,795
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken...

17
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,237
her jaw was shattered...

18
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,738
held together by wire.

19
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,336
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

20
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:58,673
But I wept.
Why did I weep?

21
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,854
She was the light of my life.

22
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:08,225
Beautiful girl.

23
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:13,697
Now she will never
be beautiful again.

24
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,340
Sorry.

25
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,984
I, I went to the police,
like a good American.

26
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,554
These two boys
were brought to trial.

27
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:41,622
A judge sentence them
to three years in prison...

28
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,228
and suspend their sentence.

29
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,531
Suspended the sentence.

30
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,100
They went free that very day.

31
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,772
I stood in the courtroom
like a fool.

32
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:58,907
And those two bastard,
they smiled at me.

33
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,916
Then I said to my wife,
"For justice...

34
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,517
we must go to Don Corleone."

35
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:14,723
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

36
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,729
What do you want of me?

37
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,824
Tell me anything,
but do what I beg you to do.

38
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,535
What is that?

39
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,928
That I cannot do.

40
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,931
I'll give you anything you ask.

41
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:59,100
We've known each other many years,
but this is the first time...

42
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:02,538
you ever came to me
for counsel or for help.

43
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:05,577
I can't remember the last time
that you invited me...

44
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:08,178
to your house
for a cup of coffee...

45
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,912
even though my wife
is godmother to your only child.

46
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,287
But let's be frank.

47
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,788
You never wanted my friendship...

48
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,920
and you were afraid
to be in my debt.

49
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,528
I didn't want
to get into trouble.

50
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:28,132
I understand.

51
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:31,034
You found paradise in America.

52
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,841
You had a good trade,
you made a good living.

53
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,538
Police protected you,
and there were courts of law.

54
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,145
So you didn't need
a friend like me.

55
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:46,543
But, now you come to me
and you say,

56
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,153
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

57
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,757
But you don't ask with respect.

58
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,420
You don't offer friendship.

59
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:59,029
You don't even think
to call me 'Godfather.'

60
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,967
Instead, you come
into my house

61
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,969
on the day my daughter
is to be married

62
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,470
and you ask me to do murder
for money.

63
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,867
I ask you for justice.

64
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,706
That is not justice.
Your daughter is still alive.

65
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:17,380
They must suffer then
as she suffers.

66
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,952
How much shall I pay you?

67
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,002
Bonasera. Bonasera.

68
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,907
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

69
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,272
If you'd come to me
in friendship,

70
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,382
then the scum
that ruined your daughter

71
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,883
would be suffering
this very day.

72
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,120
And if, by chance,

73
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,189
an honest man like yourself
should make enemies,

74
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,690
then they would become
my enemies.

75
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:04,294
And then they would fear you.

76
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,868
Be my friend?

77
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,807
Godfather.

78
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,880
Good.

79
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,917
Someday, and that day
may never come...

80
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,418
I'll call upon you
to do a service for me.

81
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,723
But until that day...

82
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:36,985
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

83
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,964
<i>- Grazie, Godfather.
- Prego</i>

84
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,507
Give this to Clemenza.

85
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,446
I want reliable people,

86
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,648
people that aren't
going to be carried away.

87
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:58,183
I mean, we're not murderers,

88
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,744
in spite of what
this undertaker says.

89
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,746
- Where's Michael?
- What? Don't worry.

90
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,514
It's early. He'll be here.

91
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:30,749
We're not taking it.

92
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,250
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

93
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:35,751
<i>No picture now.</i>

94
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,125
- What's the matter, Sonny?
- It's Michael.

95
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,644
Don Barzini.

96
00:08:37,145 --> 00:08:39,145
<i>Welcome to our house.</i>

97
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,491
Hey, Paulie!
Let me have some wine.

98
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,159
Paulie! More wine.

99
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,536
<i>Scusi, please.</i>

100
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,371
You look terrif on the floor.

101
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,872
What are you,
a dance judge or something?

102
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,375
Go take a walk around
the neighborhood. Do your job.

103
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,920
Hey, Sandra, come on. Do me a favor.
Watch the kids.

104
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,651
- Don't let 'em run wild, all right?
- Well, you watch yourself, all right?

105
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,347
Twenty or thirty grand.

106
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,848
In small bills, cash.

107
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,684
In that little silk purse.

108
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,620
If this was
somebody else's wedding.

109
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,088
<i>Hey, Paulie!
I got two gobbagool...</i>

110
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,061
<i>gabagol and a prosciutto.</i>

111
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,562
Stupid jerk!

112
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,272
Hey, what's the matter?

113
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,254
- I have to go back to work.
- Oh, Tom.

114
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,589
It's part of the wedding.

115
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,491
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

116
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,867
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

117
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:38,368
that you have invited me
to your home...

118
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,242
Get outta here.

119
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,743
This is a private party.
Go on.

120
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,180
What is it?
Hey, my sister's wedding.

121
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,756
Goddamn FBI
don't respect nothin'.

122
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,727
Hey, come here, come here.
Come here!

123
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,599
There.

124
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,614
But towards the end
he was paroled...

125
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,243
to help with
the American war effort.

126
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,851
For the last six months, he's been
working at my pastry shop.

127
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,622
Nazorine, my friend,
what can I do for you?

128
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,123
Now that the war is over...

129
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,252
this boy, Enzo, they want
to repatriate him back to Italy.

130
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,923
Godfather, I have a daughter.

131
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,532
See, she and Enzo...

132
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,537
You want Enzo to stay
in this country...

133
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,038
and you want your daughter
to be married.

134
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,608
You understand everything.

135
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,811
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.

136
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,384
And wait till you see
the beautiful wedding cake...

137
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,819
I made for your daughter.

138
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,380
Like this, with the bride
and the groom and...

139
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,722
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisan.

140
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,027
Give it to a Jew congressman
in another district.

141
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,670
Who else is on the list?

142
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,013
Hey, Michael.
How are you?

143
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,514
Hello.

144
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,930
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

145
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,711
Is this...Is this necessary?

146
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,646
He didn't expect to be invited
to the wedding...

147
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,715
so he wanted to thank you.

148
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,416
All right.

149
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,648
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

150
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,254
that you have invited me
to your home...

151
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,857
on the wedding day
of your daughter.

152
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,760
And may their first child
be a masculine child.

153
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:19,387
- Don...
- Michael?

154
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,065
Don Corleone...

155
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,566
That man over there
is talking to himself.

156
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,970
See that scary guy over there?

157
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:28,807
He's a very scary guy.

158
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,142
Who is he?
What's his name?

159
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,737
His name is Luca Brasi...

160
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,346
and he helps my father out
sometimes.

161
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,645
Oh, Michael, wait a minute.
He's coming over here.

162
00:13:39,646 --> 00:13:40,646
Mike!

163
00:13:40,647 --> 00:13:42,147
Ho! Tom.

164
00:13:42,148 --> 00:13:43,648
Heyyy!

165
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,724
You look terrific!

166
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,927
My brother Tom Hagen.
This is Kay Adams.

167
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,453
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

168
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,932
Your father's
been asking for you.

169
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,667
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

170
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,168
I'll be there.

171
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,233
If he's your brother,
why does he have a different name?

172
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,342
Oh, uh, when my brother Sonny was a kid...

173
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,843
he found Tom Hagen in the street,
and he had no home.

174
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,246
And so my father took him in...

175
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:13,316
and he's been with us ever since.

176
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,519
He's a good lawyer.

177
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,324
Not a Sicilian, but...

178
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,659
I think he's gonna be consigliere.

179
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,160
- What's that?
- That's...

180
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,431
like a counselor, an advisor.

181
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,932
Very important to the family.

182
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,001
You like your lasagna?

183
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:40,912
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

184
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:44,244
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding...

185
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,355
on the day
of your daughter's wedding.

186
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,125
And I hope
that their first child...

187
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,728
be a masculine child.

188
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:04,593
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

189
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,473
For your daughter's
bridal purse.

190
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,466
Thank you, Luca,
my most valued friend.

191
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:15,035
Don Corleone,
I'm gonna leave you now...

192
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,215
because I know you are busy.

193
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,716
Thank you.

194
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,206
Senator Cauly apologized
for not coming personally...

195
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,811
but said you'd understand.

196
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,648
Also some of the judges.

197
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,651
They've all sent gifts.

198
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,988
What is that outside?

199
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:49,627
Johnny!

200
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,071
I love you.

201
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:03,774
Hey, Johnny, look over here!

202
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,612
He came all the way from California
to come to the wedding.

203
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,820
- I told you he was going to come.
- It's been two years.

204
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,321
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

205
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:18,061
Sing a song.

206
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,111
Michael, you never told me
you knew Johnny Fontane.

207
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:39,173
- Sure. You wanna meet him?
- Huh? Oh, well, sure.

208
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,352
My father helped him
with his career.

209
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:44,447
- For my Connie.
- He did? How?

210
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,324
<i>I have but one</i>

211
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,259
- Let's listen to the song.
- No, Michael

212
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,894
<i>Heart</i>

213
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:53,592
<i>This heart I bring you</i>

214
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,534
<i>I have but one heart</i>

215
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,138
<i>To share with you</i>

216
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,876
<i>I have but one dream</i>

217
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,576
<i>That I can cling to</i>

218
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:18,751
<i>You are the one dream</i>

219
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:22,122
<i>I pray comes true</i>

220
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,263
Please, Michael. Tell me.

221
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,927
<i>My darling, until I saw you</i>

222
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,035
Well, when Johnny was first starting out...

223
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,903
he was signed to this
personal service contract...

224
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,506
with a big bandleader.

225
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,010
And as his career
got better and better...

226
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,511
he wanted to get out of it.

227
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,910
Now, Johnny is
my father's godson...

228
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,517
and my father went
to see this bandleader...

229
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,953
and he offered him
$10,000 to let Johnny go.

230
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,924
But the bandleader said no.

231
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,387
So the next day
my father went to see him...

232
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,997
only this time
with Luca Brasi.

233
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,728
And within an hour,
he signed a release...

234
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,501
for a certified check of $1,000.

235
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,377
How'd he do that?

236
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,903
My father made him an offer
he couldn't refuse.

237
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,849
What was that?

238
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,681
Luca Brasi
held a gun to his head...

239
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,056
and my father assured him
that either his brains...

240
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,557
or his signature
would be on the contract.

241
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,631
That's a true story.

242
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,511
That's my family, Kay.
It's not me.

243
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,860
Beautiful!

244
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:14,171
My godson comes all the way
from California.

245
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,672
Give him a glass of wine.

246
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,894
I'll take care of it.

247
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,365
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

248
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,909
How are you, Fredo?

249
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:56,045
My brother Fredo.
This is Kay Adams.

250
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,649
- Hi.
- How ya doin'?

251
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,617
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

252
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:07,223
Yeah.
This is your friend, huh?

253
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,624
I don't know what to do.
My voice is, is weak.

254
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,066
It's weak.

255
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,695
Anyway, if I had this part
in the picture, you know...

256
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,431
it puts me right back
up on top again.

257
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,040
But this, uh...

258
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,310
this man out there,
he won't give it to me.

259
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:28,379
- The head of the studio.
- What's his name?

260
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,974
Woltz. Woltz.
He won't give it to me...

261
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,644
and he says
there's no chance, no chance.

262
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,157
Sonny?

263
00:22:41,858 --> 00:22:42,858
Sonny?

264
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
Sonny?

265
00:22:51,301 --> 00:22:53,129
Sonny, you in there?

266
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,871
- What?
- The old man wants to see you.

267
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:59,842
All right, one minute.

268
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,584
A month ago, he bought
the movie rights to this book.

269
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,529
A best-seller.

270
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,831
And the main character
is a guy just like me.

271
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,332
Why, I wouldn't even
have to act.

272
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:24,835
Just be myself.

273
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:28,704
Oh, Godfather, I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

274
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,044
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

275
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:35,880
Is this how you turned out?

276
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,509
A Hollywood finocchio
that cries like a woman?

277
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:42,520
"What can I do?"
"What can I do?"

278
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,088
What is that nonsense?

279
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,589
Ridiculous!

280
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,861
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

281
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:55,533
Good.

282
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,635
Because the man who doesn't
spend time with his family...

283
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,970
can never be a real man.

284
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,471
Come here.

285
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,444
You look terrible.
I want you to eat.

286
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,682
I want you to rest well,
and a month from now...

287
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:14,811
this Hollywood big shot's
gonna give you what you want.

288
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,420
Too late.
They start shooting in a week.

289
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,690
I'm gonna make him an offer
he can't refuse.

290
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,197
Now just go outside,
enjoy yourself and...

291
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,792
forget about all this nonsense.

292
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,896
Listen. I want you
to leave it all to me.

293
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,339
All right.

294
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:02,328
What time does my daughter
leave with the bridegroom?

295
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,934
In a few minutes,
right after they cut the cake.

296
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:08,133
Now, your new son-in-law,
we give him something important.

297
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,608
Never.
Give him a living...

298
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:13,635
but never discuss
the family business with him.

299
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,145
What else?

300
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,747
Virgil Sollozzo called.

301
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:19,149
We have to give him a day
sometime next week.

302
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,650
We'll discuss him when you
come back from California.

303
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,021
When am I going to California?

304
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,123
I want you to go tonight.

305
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,922
I want you to talk
to this movie big shot...

306
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,527
and settle this business
for Johnny.

307
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:35,465
Now if there's nothing else, I'd like
to go to my daughter's wedding.

308
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:41,337
Carlo, we're gonna take
the picture.

309
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:44,808
Wait a minute.

310
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,309
No, Michael, not me.

311
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,549
Just a little closer.

312
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,050
Okay, that's it.
Just like that now. Hold it.

313
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,390
Isn't that nice?

314
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,098
All right, start talking.

315
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:50,599
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

316
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:54,065
This friend is my client and would
give his undying friendship...

317
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,903
to Mr. Woltz, if Mr. Woltz
would grant us a small favor.

318
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,509
Woltz is listening.

319
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,606
Give Johnny the part in that new
war film you're starting next week.

320
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:13,280
And what favor
would your friend...

321
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,292
grant Mr. Woltz?

322
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,194
You're gonna have
some union problems.

323
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,029
My client could make them disappear.

324
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,165
Also, one of your top stars
has just moved...

325
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,167
from marijuana to heroin.

326
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,169
- Are you trying to muscle me?
- Absolutely not.

327
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,571
Now listen to me,
you smooth-talking son of a bitch!

328
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:30,234
Let me lay it on the line for you
and your boss, whoever he is!

329
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:31,975
Johnny Fontane
will never get that movie.

330
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:34,476
I don't care
how many dago, guinea, wop...

331
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,847
greaseball goombahs
come outta the woodwork.

332
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,115
I'm German-Irish.

333
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,710
Well, let me tell you something,
my kraut mick friend.

334
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,720
I'm going to make so much trouble for you,
you won't know what hit you.

335
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,823
Mr. Woltz, I'm a lawyer.
I have not threatened...

336
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,725
I know almost every big lawyer
in New York. Who the hell are you?

337
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:52,058
I have a special practice.
I handle one client.

338
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:54,663
Now, you have my number.
I'll wait for your call.

339
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,567
By the way, I admire
your pictures very much.

340
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:06,008
Check him out.

341
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:30,332
- This is really beautiful.
- Look at this.

342
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,636
It used to decorate
the palace of a king.

343
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:34,938
Oh, yeah. Very nice.

344
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,567
Why didn't you say
you worked for Corleone, Tom?

345
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:39,943
I thought you were just
some cheap, two-bit hustler...

346
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,012
Johnny was running in,
trying to bluff me.

347
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:44,513
I don't like to use his name
unless it's really necessary.

348
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:46,116
- How's your drink, Tom?
- Fine.

349
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,847
Hey, come on over here with me. I want to
show you something really beautiful.

350
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,453
You do appreciate beauty,
don't you, Tom?

351
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:57,518
There you are.
$600,000 on four hooves.

352
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,962
I'll bet Russian czars...

353
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,298
never paid that kind of dough
for a single horse.

354
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,799
Khartoum.

355
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:10,630
I'm not gonna race him, though.
I'm gonna put him out to stud.

356
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,309
Beautiful.

357
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,977
- Thanks, Tony.
- You're welcome.

358
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,478
- Come on.
- Let's get something to eat.

359
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:20,449
Mr. Corleone
is Johnny's godfather.

360
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,787
To the Italian people,
that's a very religious...

361
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,789
sacred, close relationship.

362
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,924
I respect that.

363
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,425
Just tell him he should ask me
anything else.

364
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:32,027
But this is one favor
I can't give him.

365
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,830
He never asks a second favor
when he's been refused the first.

366
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:37,891
- Understood?
- You don't understand.

367
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,502
Johnny Fontane
never gets that movie.

368
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,603
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

369
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,711
I'm gonna run him
out of the business.

370
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:50,212
And let me tell you why.

371
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:54,578
Johnny Fontane ruined
one of Woltz International's...

372
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,687
most valuable protégés.

373
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,022
For five years,
we had her under training.

374
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,083
Singing lessons,
acting lessons, dancing lessons.

375
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,595
I spent hundreds of thousands
of dollars on her.

376
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,897
I was gonna make her a big star.

377
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:09,628
And let me be even more frank.

378
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:12,135
Just to show you that I'm not
a hard-hearted man...

379
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,661
that it's not all dollars and cents.

380
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:16,572
She was beautiful!

381
00:31:16,802 --> 00:31:18,802
She was young, she was innocent!

382
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:20,811
She was the greatest piece of ass
I've ever had...

383
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:23,312
and I've had 'em all over the world!

384
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:26,183
And then Johnny Fontane comes along...

385
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:29,085
with his olive oil voice and guinea charm.

386
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,888
And she runs off.

387
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:36,250
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous...

388
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,897
and a man in my position can't afford...

389
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,662
to be made to look ridiculous!

390
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:45,168
Now you get the hell outta here!

391
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:47,304
And if that goombah
tries any rough stuff...

392
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,805
you tell him I ain't no bandleader.

393
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,703
Yeah. I heard that story.

394
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:57,312
Thank you for the dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

395
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,344
If your car could take me
to the airport...

396
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:05,252
Mr. Corleone is a man who insists
on hearing bad news immediately.

397
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:01,899
- You're not too tired are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

398
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,506
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

399
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,643
Now...

400
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,946
Sollozzo is known as "The Turk."

401
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,984
He's supposed to be
very good with a knife...

402
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,786
<i>but only
in matters of business...</i>

403
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,287
<i>with some sort
of reasonable complaint.</i>

404
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,617
<i>His business is narcotics.</i>

405
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:25,059
<i>He has fields in Turkey
where they grow the poppy...</i>

406
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:28,064
<i>and in Sicily he has the plants
to process them into heroin.</i>

407
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:32,734
<i>Now, he needs cash and he needs
protection from the police...</i>

408
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:34,938
<i>for which he gives
a piece of the action.</i>

409
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,940
<i>I couldn't find out how much.</i>

410
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:39,739
<i>The Tattaglia family
is behind him here in New York.</i>

411
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,012
<i>Now, they have to be
in it for something.</i>

412
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,146
Santino Corleone.

413
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,015
What about his prison record?

414
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,516
Two terms,
one in Italy, one here.

415
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,586
He's known as
a top narcotics man.

416
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:53,088
Santino, what do you think?

417
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,692
There's a lot of money
in that white powder.

418
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,329
Tom?

419
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,830
<i>Well, I say, yes, there's more
money potential in narcotics...</i>

420
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,900
<i>than anything else
we're looking at.</i>

421
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:06,336
<i>Now, if we don't get into it,
somebody else will.</i>

422
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:08,472
<i>Maybe one of the five families,
maybe all of them.</i>

423
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:09,673
<i>Now, with the money they earn...</i>

424
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:13,007
they can buy more police
and political power.

425
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,312
Then they come after us.

426
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:18,077
Now we have the unions,
we have the gambling...

427
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:20,484
and they're the best things
to have, but narcotics...

428
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:21,985
is a thing of the future.

429
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:23,820
Now, if we don't get
a piece of that action...

430
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,322
we risk everything we have.

431
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,823
I mean, not now,
but ten years from now.

432
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,456
So? What's your answer
gonna be, Pop?

433
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,707
I need a man
who has powerful friends.

434
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:49,307
I need a million dollars in cash.

435
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:51,515
I need, Don Corleone,
those politicians...

436
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:55,179
that you carry in your pocket
like so many nickels and dimes.

437
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:58,889
What is the interest
for my family?

438
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,824
Thirty percent.

439
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,623
In the first year, your end
should be three, four million dollars.

440
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,429
And then it would go up.

441
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:10,532
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

442
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:16,038
My compliments.

443
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,471
I'll take care of the Tattaglias.
Outta my share.

444
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,176
So, I receive 30%
for finance...

445
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,785
political influence
and legal protection.

446
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:31,286
- That's what you're telling me.
- That's right.

447
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:37,093
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

448
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,130
If you consider
a million dollars in cash...

449
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:42,431
just "finance"...

450
00:36:42,432 --> 00:36:44,432
<i>I salute you, Don Corleone.</i>

451
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:58,214
I said that I would see you because...

452
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,517
I heard that you were
a serious man...

453
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:03,018
to be treated with respect.

454
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:10,855
But I must say no to you.

455
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:14,497
And I'll give you my reason.

456
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:17,296
It's true, I have
a lot of friends in politics.

457
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,971
But they wouldn't be friendly
very long...

458
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:23,340
if they knew my business was drugs
instead of gambling...

459
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:26,538
which they regard
as a harmless vice.

460
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:29,272
- But drugs is a dirty business.
- No, Don Corleone...

461
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,381
It doesn't make
any difference to me...

462
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:34,146
what a man does for a living,
you understand...

463
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,752
but your business is...

464
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,556
a little dangerous.

465
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:42,057
If you're worried about security
for your million...

466
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,760
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

467
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,491
You're tellin' me the Tattaglias
guarantee our investment...

468
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,097
Wait a minute.

469
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,173
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children...

470
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:59,509
and I spoil them,
as you can see.

471
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,211
They talk when they should listen.

472
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:03,346
But anyway...

473
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:05,847
Signor Sollozzo,
my no is final...

474
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,714
and I wish to congratulate you
on your new business.

475
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:12,084
I know you'll do very well,
and good luck to you...

476
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:15,158
especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine.

477
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:19,094
Thank you.

478
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,050
Come here.

479
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,655
What's the matter with you?

480
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,457
I think your brain
is going soft...

481
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:50,325
from all that comedy you're
playing with that young girl.

482
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:53,829
Never tell anybody outside the
family what you're thinking again.

483
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,500
Go on.

484
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:03,968
Tom, what?
What is this nonsense?

485
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,575
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

486
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:11,114
Well, take it away.

487
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,615
Take it over there.

488
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:16,353
And...

489
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,854
tell Luca Brasi to come in.

490
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,858
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

491
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:31,332
I want you to find out what he's got
under his fingernails, you know?

492
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:34,237
Go to the Tattaglias...

493
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:36,573
and make them think...

494
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:40,271
that you're not too happy
with our family...

495
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,879
and find out what you can.

496
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:04,657
And I got something
for your mother and for Sonny...

497
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:06,836
and a tie for Freddy...

498
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:09,533
and Tom Hagen
got the Reynolds pen.

499
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,741
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Me?

500
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,242
Oh, just you.

501
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:48,578
Tell Paulie to get the car.
We're going.

502
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,013
Okay, Pa.

503
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:52,915
I'll have to get it myself, Pa.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

504
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,420
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind gettin' the car.

505
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:50,929
Luca, I'm Bruno Tattaglia.

506
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,509
I know.

507
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,010
Scotch? Prewar.

508
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,685
You know who I am?

509
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,820
Oh. Tom Hagen.

510
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:45,622
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah.

511
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,558
I'm glad I run into you.
I wanna talk to you.

512
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,560
I haven't got time.

513
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:53,325
Oh, make time, consigliere.
Get in the car.

514
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:57,033
What are you worried about?

515
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:59,534
If I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead already.

516
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:02,837
Get in.

517
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:14,818
<i>Wait a moment, Fredo.</i>

518
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:17,519
- I'm gonna buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pa.

519
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,560
Hi. Merry Christmas.

520
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:27,061
I want some fruit over there.

521
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,300
Gimme three of them.

522
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,904
No, that one.

523
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,524
Fredo!

524
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:45,673
Papa.

525
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:48,209
Papa!

526
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,814
Mike, would you like me better
if I were a nun...

527
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,419
like in the story, you know?

528
00:46:00,658 --> 00:46:01,658
No.

529
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,660
Well, then would you like me better
if I were Ingrid Bergman?

530
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,262
Now that's a thought.

531
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:09,633
Michael.

532
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:13,565
No, I would not like you better
if you were Ingrid Bergman.

533
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,170
- Michael.
- What's the matter?

534
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,455
They don't say
if he's dead or alive.

535
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,575
Sonny, Michael.

536
00:46:58,576 --> 00:46:59,976
<i>Michael, where you been?</i>

537
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:01,751
Is he all right?

538
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:04,482
<i>We don't know yet.
There's all kinds of stories.</i>

539
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:08,523
<i>He was hit bad, Mikey.</i>

540
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:12,087
<i>- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.</i>

541
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:14,630
<i>Where you been? I was worried.</i>

542
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:16,799
Didn't Tom tell you?
I called.

543
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,531
<i>No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?</i>

544
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:23,137
All right.

545
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,346
Oh, my God.

546
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:47,829
Who is it?

547
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:50,431
Open up. It's Clemenza.

548
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:52,501
What?

549
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:55,002
There's more news about your old man.

550
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:57,540
The word is out on the street
he's already dead.

551
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,542
Shut your mouth.
What's the matter with you?

552
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:02,043
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy. Take it easy.

553
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,280
- Where was Paulie?
- Paulie was out sick.

554
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,781
- He's been home sick all winter.
- How many times he been sick?

555
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,417
Only maybe three, four times.

556
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:10,486
I mean, I asked Freddy if he wants
a different bodyguard.

557
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:12,221
- He said no.
- Pick him up right now.

558
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,056
I don't care how sick he is.

559
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,719
If he's breathin', I want you to bring him to
my father's house now. You understand? Now

560
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:19,625
- You want me to send people here?
- No, just you and him. Go ahead.

561
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,230
All right.

562
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,739
I'm havin' a couple of our people come
over to the house. A couple of our people.

563
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:38,314
<i>- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?</i>

564
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:40,815
<i>- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.</i>

565
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:44,921
<i>In about three hours, he'll be
released with our proposition.</i>

566
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:48,389
<i>Listen to everything he has
to say before you do anything.</i>

567
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:50,126
<i>What's done is done.</i>

568
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:53,096
<i>And don't lose that famous temper
of yours, huh, Sonny?</i>

569
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:55,696
No, I'll wait.

570
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:11,712
Your boss is dead.

571
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:16,519
I know you're not in the muscle
end of the family, Tom...

572
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,020
so I don't want you to be scared.

573
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:22,114
I want you
to help the Corleones...

574
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:24,725
and I want you to help me.

575
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,131
Yeah. We got him outside his office...

576
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,632
just about an hour after we picked you up.

577
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,970
Drink it.

578
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:42,545
So now it's up to you to make
the peace between me and Sonny.

579
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:49,584
Sonny was hot
for my deal, wasn't he?

580
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,488
And you knew it was
the right thing to do.

581
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,825
Sonny will come after you
with everything he's got.

582
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:01,095
That'll be his first reaction, sure.

583
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:04,266
That's why you gotta
talk some sense into him.

584
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:07,498
The Tattaglia family is behind me
with all their people.

585
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:10,639
The other New York families
will go along with anything...

586
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,140
that will prevent a full-scale war.

587
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:16,078
Let's face it, Tom,
in all due respect...

588
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,639
the Don, rest in peace, was slippin'.

589
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:24,051
Ten years ago,
could I have gotten to him?

590
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,092
Well, now he's dead.

591
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:32,593
He's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

592
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,365
So you gotta talk to Sonny.

593
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,300
You gotta talk
to the caporegimes...

594
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:40,801
that Tessio, and that fat Clemenza.

595
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,708
It's good business, Tom.

596
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:50,946
I'll try.

597
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:53,609
But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

598
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,120
Yeah. Well...

599
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:02,423
Let me worry about Luca.

600
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:09,732
You just talk to Sonny.

601
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,233
And the other two kids.

602
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:16,972
I'll do my best.

603
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:19,473
Good.

604
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:22,777
Now, you can go.

605
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:32,986
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

606
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:37,024
Blood is a big expense.

607
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,015
He's still alive.

608
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:02,516
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

609
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,021
Well, that's bad luck for me...

610
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:08,522
and bad luck for you
if you don't make that deal.

611
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,571
Your mother's over
in the hospital with your father.

612
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:58,072
Looks like he's gonna
pull through, thank God.

613
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:02,411
- That's a lot of bad blood.
- What do you think?

614
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:05,279
It's too far.
I think it's too personal.

615
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:08,044
- The Don will consider this over.
- You gonna kill all those guys?

616
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:10,651
- Hey, stay out of it, Mickey, do me a favor.
- Sollozzo's the key.

617
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:12,955
You get rid of him,
everything falls into line.

618
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:15,550
What about Luca? Sollozzo
didn't seem worried about Luca.

619
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:21,026
I don't know. If Luca sold out,
we're in a lot of trouble.

620
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,199
Has anyone been able
to get in touch with Luca?

621
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,301
We've been tryin' all night.
He might be shacked up.

622
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:26,368
Hey, Mick, try him again.

623
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,037
Luca never sleeps over
with a broad.

624
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,538
He always goes home
when he's through.

625
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:34,043
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.

626
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:37,272
What do we do
if the old man dies, God forbid?

627
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,880
If we lose the old man...

628
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:43,585
we lose our political contacts
and half our strength.

629
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:46,588
The other New York families might
wind up supporting Sollozzo...

630
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:49,058
just to avoid a long destructive war.

631
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,790
This is almost 1946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

632
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:56,530
If your father dies...

633
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:59,635
you'll make the deal, Sonny.

634
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:02,196
You know, that's easy for you to say,
Tom. He's not your father.

635
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:04,805
I was as much a son to him
as you or Mike.

636
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,746
What is it?

637
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,216
Hey, Paulie, I thought
I told you to stay put.

638
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:16,845
Well, the guy at the gates,
they say they got a package.

639
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:19,453
Yeah?
Tessio, go see what it is.

640
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,827
- You want me to hang around?
- Yeah, hang around.

641
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:26,328
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

642
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:29,025
Yeah? There's some food
in the icebox. You hungry or anything?

643
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:31,200
- No, it's all right. Thanks.
- How 'bout a drink? How 'bout a little brandy?

644
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:32,968
- That's good to sweat it out.
- All right, sure.

645
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:35,469
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

646
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:39,673
I want you to take care
of that son of a bitch right away.

647
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:42,234
Paulie sold out the old man, that strutz.

648
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:45,439
I don't wanna see him again. Make that
first thing on your list, understand?

649
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:46,882
Understood.

650
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:49,218
Hey, Mickey, tomorrow.
You get a couple of guys.

651
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:51,420
You go over to Luca's apartment. Hang
around. Wait for him to show up.

652
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:55,482
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

653
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:57,860
Yeah.

654
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:01,388
Listen, hang around the house
on the phone. It'll be a big help.

655
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:04,999
Try Luca again. Go ahead.

656
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:16,176
- What the hell is this?
- It's a Sicilian message.

657
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:18,779
It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

658
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:35,062
- I'm goin' now.
- What time you gonna be home tonight?

659
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:37,598
I don't know. Probably late.

660
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:42,395
- Don't forget the cannoli.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

661
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:48,908
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rearview mirror.

662
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:52,648
That Sonny's runnin' wild.

663
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:54,717
He's thinkin' of goin'
to the mattresses already.

664
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:57,278
We gotta find a spot
over on the West Side.

665
00:55:57,387 --> 00:56:00,481
We'll try 309 West 43rd Street.

666
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:02,958
You know any good spots
on the West Side?

667
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:05,459
- Yeah, I'll think about it.
- Well, think about it while you're drivin'.

668
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:07,830
I wanna hit New York sometime this month.

669
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:10,331
And watch out for the kids
when you're backin' out.

670
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,145
Hey, Paulie, I want you to go
down 39th Street. Colosanto's.

671
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:26,206
You pick up 18 mattresses for the guys
to sleep, will you? Bring me the bill.

672
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:29,217
- Yeah, all right.
- Make sure they're clean because...

673
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:32,516
Those guys are gonna be stuck up
in there for a long time, you know?

674
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:34,823
They're clean. They told me
they exterminate them.

675
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,925
"Exterminate"?
That's a bad word to use.

676
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:39,895
Exterminate. Get this guy.
See how we don't exterminate you.

677
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:42,496
<i>- Youse funny, or what?
- Hey, Paulie. Did you fart?</i>

678
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,200
- Yeah, Rocco, what'd you do?
- No, me. Nothin'. It wasn't me.

679
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:48,337
- It's gotta be him.
- Hey, pull over, will you.

680
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:50,838
I gotta take a leak.

681
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:33,849
Leave the gun.

682
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:36,350
Take the cannoli.

683
00:57:53,139 --> 00:57:54,639
<i>Hey, Mike?</i>

684
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,640
<i>Hey, Mikey?</i>

685
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,141
Yeah?

686
00:57:59,241 --> 00:58:00,641
<i>You're wanted on the telephone.</i>

687
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:08,849
- Who is it?
- It's some girl.

688
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,122
Hello, Kay?

689
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:15,491
<i>How's your father?</i>

690
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,292
He's good.
He's gonna make it.

691
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:19,793
<i>I love you.</i>

692
00:58:19,794 --> 00:58:20,794
Huh?

693
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:23,097
<i>I love you!</i>

694
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,834
<i>Michael?</i>

695
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:26,235
Yeah, I know.

696
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:28,036
<i>Tell me you love me.</i>

697
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:29,737
Yeah, I can't talk.

698
00:58:29,738 --> 00:58:31,538
<i>Can't you say it?</i>

699
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,842
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

700
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:38,036
Hey, Mikey. Why don't you tell
that nice girl you love her?

701
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:40,215
I love you
with all o' my heart!

702
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:42,741
If I don't see you again a-soon,
I'm-a gonna die!

703
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:45,988
Come over here, kid.
Learn somethin'.

704
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:48,489
You never know. You might have to cook
for 20 guys someday.

705
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:51,326
You see? You start out
with a little bit of oil.

706
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:52,895
Then you fry some garlic.

707
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:55,524
Then you throw in some tomatoes,
some tomato paste.

708
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:58,294
You fry it.
You make sure it doesn't stick.

709
00:58:58,401 --> 00:59:01,564
When you got it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and your meatballs.

710
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,940
Add a little bit of wine.

711
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:12,680
And a little bit of sugar.

712
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:15,450
- And that's my trick.
- Why don't you cut the crap?

713
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:17,619
I got more important things
for you to do.

714
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:20,214
- How's Paulie?
- Oh, Paulie. Won't see him no more.

715
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:24,792
- Where you going?
- To the city.

716
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:26,461
Send some bodyguards with him.

717
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:28,463
- No. I'm just going to the hospital to see Pop.
- Nevermind. Send somebody with him.

718
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:31,365
Oh, he'll be all right.
Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.

719
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:33,967
- All right. Be careful, huh?
- Yes, sir.

720
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:39,473
Send somebody with him anyway.

721
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,504
I have to go.

722
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:12,005
Can I go with you?

723
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:14,902
No, Kay. There's gonna be
detectives there.

724
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:17,012
People from the press.

725
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:19,513
Well, I'll ride in a cab.

726
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:24,017
I don't want you to get involved.

727
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:29,189
When will I see you again?

728
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:37,366
Go back to New Hampshire...

729
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:39,867
and I'll call you
at your parents' house.

730
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:43,704
When will I see you again,
Michael?

731
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:47,708
I don't know.

732
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,875
What are you doing here?

733
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:01,977
You're not supposed
to be here now.

734
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:05,539
I'm Michael Corleone.
This is my father.

735
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:08,208
There's nobody here.
What happened to the guards?

736
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:10,652
Your father just had
too many visitors.

737
01:03:10,653 --> 01:03:13,554
They interfered
with hospital service.

738
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:16,557
The police made them leave
about ten minutes ago.

739
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:25,399
Get me Long Beach 4-5-6-2-0, please.

740
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:30,504
Nurse, wait a minute.
Stay here.

741
01:03:34,343 --> 01:03:36,678
Sonny, Michael.
I'm at the hospital.

742
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:39,239
Listen. I got here late.
There's nobody here.

743
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:42,340
Nobody. No Tessio's men,
no detectives, nobody.

744
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:45,249
<i>- Pop is all alone.
- Don't panic. We'll send somebody.</i>

745
01:03:45,354 --> 01:03:47,689
I won't panic.

746
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:50,250
I'm sorry, but you will
have to leave.

747
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:55,926
You and I are gonna move my father
to another room.

748
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:59,092
Now, can you disconnect those tubes
so we can move the bed out?

749
01:03:59,202 --> 01:04:02,694
- That's out of the question.
- Do you know my father?

750
01:04:02,805 --> 01:04:05,006
Men are coming here to kill him.

751
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,142
You understand?

752
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:09,643
Now, help me, please.

753
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:30,721
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo... the baker.

754
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:32,327
- You remember me?
- Enzo?

755
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:34,162
- Yes, Enzo.
- You better get out of here, Enzo.

756
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:36,164
There's gonna be trouble.

757
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:38,665
If there is trouble,
I stay here to help you...

758
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:41,168
For your father. For your father.

759
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:44,005
All right, listen.

760
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:46,174
Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital.

761
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:49,201
All right? I'll be out
in a minute. Go ahead.

762
01:05:49,202 --> 01:05:50,602
Okay, okay.

763
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:07,425
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

764
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:11,131
I'm with you now.

765
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:14,801
I'm with you.

766
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:51,838
Get rid of these.
Come here.

767
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:54,674
Put your hand in your pocket
like you have a gun.

768
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,844
You'll be all right.

769
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:04,618
You'll be okay.

770
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:50,830
You did good.

771
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:26,134
Here he is.

772
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:28,635
All right, hold still.

773
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:40,515
I thought I got
all you guinea hoods locked up.

774
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:41,983
What the hell are you doing here?

775
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:44,484
What happened to the men who
were guarding my father, Captain?

776
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:46,488
Why, you little punk.

777
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:48,490
What the hell are you doing,
telling me my business?

778
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:50,391
I pulled them guys off of here.

779
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:53,384
Now, you get out of here
and stay away from this hospital.

780
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:56,465
I'm not moving until you put
some guards around my father's room.

781
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:59,167
Phil, take him in.

782
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:01,603
The kid's clean, Captain.
He's a war hero.

783
01:09:01,604 --> 01:09:04,505
- He's never been busted...
- Goddamn it, I said take him in.

784
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:09,134
What's the Turk paying you
to set up my father, Captain?

785
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:12,580
Take a hold of him.
Stand him up.

786
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:15,081
Stand him up straight.

787
01:09:36,972 --> 01:09:39,040
I'm the attorney
for the Corleone family.

788
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:41,771
These men are private detectives
hired to protect Vito Corleone.

789
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:44,412
They're licensed to carry firearms.

790
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:46,913
If you interfere, you'll have to
appear before a judge...

791
01:09:46,982 --> 01:09:49,542
in the morning and show cause.

792
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:52,152
All right, let him go.

793
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:54,721
Come on.

794
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:26,187
What's with all the new faces?

795
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:28,022
Gonna need 'em now.

796
01:10:28,023 --> 01:10:30,651
After the hospital thing,
Sonny got mad.

797
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:33,887
We hit Bruno Tattaglia
at 4:00 this morning.

798
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:37,697
Jesus Christ.

799
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:46,539
Looks like a fortress around here.

800
01:10:51,046 --> 01:10:53,947
A hundred button men on the street,
24 hours a day.

801
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:57,280
That Turk shows one hair
on his ass, he's dead. Believe me.

802
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:02,388
Hey, Mike, come here.
Let me look at you.

803
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:07,528
You look beautiful.
Just beautiful.

804
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:09,030
You're gorgeous.

805
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:11,727
Hey, listen to this.
The Turk, he wants to talk.

806
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:14,564
Imagine the nerve
on this son of a bitch.

807
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:17,005
Craps out last night,
he wants a meeting today.

808
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:19,506
- What'd he say?
- What did he say?

809
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:22,343
He wants us to send Michael
to hear the proposition.

810
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:25,404
And the promise is that the deal
is so good that we can't refuse.

811
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:27,682
What about Bruno Tattaglia?

812
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:29,350
That's part of the deal.

813
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:31,352
Bruno cancels out what they did
to my father.

814
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:33,853
Sonny, we ought to hear
what they have to say.

815
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:36,691
No. No. No. No more.
Not this time, Consigliere.

816
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:40,253
No more meetings, no more discussions,
no more Sollozzo tricks.

817
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:42,196
You give them one message...
I want Sollozzo.

818
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:43,865
If not, it's all-out war.
We go to the mattresses.

819
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:45,533
Some of the other families
won't sit still for a war.

820
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:47,702
- Then they hand me Sollozzo.
- Your father wouldn't hear this.

821
01:11:47,703 --> 01:11:50,763
- This is business, not personal.
- They shot my father.

822
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:54,274
Even shooting your father
was business, not personal, Sonny.

823
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:56,210
Well, then business will have to suffer.
All right?

824
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:58,046
And do me a favor, Tom...

825
01:11:58,047 --> 01:12:00,048
No more advice on how
to patch things up.

826
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:02,549
Just help me win, please.
All right?

827
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:11,050
I found out about this Captain McCluskey
who broke Mike's jaw.

828
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,660
What about him?

829
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:15,721
Now he's definitely on Sollozzo's
payroll, and for big money.

830
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:18,732
McCluskey has agreed
to be the Turk's bodyguard.

831
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:20,835
What you have to understand,
Sonny...

832
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:23,004
is that while Sollozzo's
being guarded like this...

833
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,839
he is invulnerable.

834
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:28,401
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain. Never.

835
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:31,570
It would be disastrous. All the
five families would come after you, Sonny.

836
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,410
The Corleone family
would be outcast.

837
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:38,213
Even the old man's political
protection would run for cover.

838
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:41,856
So do me a favor.

839
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:44,485
Take this into consideration.

840
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:49,796
All right, we'll wait.

841
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:57,036
We can't wait.

842
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,040
Can't wait.

843
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:00,808
I don't care what Sollozzo says
about a deal.

844
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:02,977
He's gonna kill Pop.
That's it.

845
01:13:02,978 --> 01:13:04,812
That's the key for him.

846
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:06,814
Got to get Sollozzo.

847
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,983
CLEMENZA: Mike is right.

848
01:13:08,984 --> 01:13:10,985
Let me ask you something first.

849
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:14,046
What about this McCluskey?

850
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:16,656
What do we do with this cop here?

851
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:23,496
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

852
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,560
It will be me...

853
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:30,169
McCluskey and Sollozzo.

854
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:33,673
Let's set the meeting.

855
01:13:35,344 --> 01:13:38,745
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

856
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:44,580
Now we insist it's a public place...
a bar, a restaurant.

857
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:48,417
Someplace where there's people,
so I feel safe.

858
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,261
They're gonna search me
when I first meet them, right?

859
01:13:54,363 --> 01:13:56,863
So I can't have a weapon on me then.

860
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:02,535
But if Clemenza can figure a way...

861
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:05,138
to have a weapon
planted there for me...

862
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:12,478
then I'll kill them both.

863
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:26,884
What are you gonna do?
Nice college boy, huh?

864
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:28,996
Didn't want to get mixed up
in the family business.

865
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:30,998
Now you want to gun down
a police captain?

866
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:33,000
Why? 'Cause he slapped you
in the face a little bit?

867
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:35,336
What do you think this is, the army,
where you shoot them a mile away?

868
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:37,004
You gotta get up close,
like this and...

869
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:40,406
You blow their brains all over your
nice Ivy League suit. Come here.

870
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:42,844
You're taking this very personal.

871
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:46,076
Tom, this is business, and this man
is taking it very, very personal.

872
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:48,216
Where does it say that
you can't kill a cop?

873
01:14:48,217 --> 01:14:50,742
- Come on, Mikey.
- Tom, wait a minute.

874
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:53,583
I'm talking about a cop
that's mixed up in drugs.

875
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:57,819
I'm talking about a dishonest cop,
a crooked cop...

876
01:14:57,926 --> 01:15:00,793
who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming to him.

877
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:02,964
That's a terrific story.

878
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:05,695
Now we have newspaper people
on the payroll, don't we, Tom?

879
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:09,470
They might like a story like that.

880
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:11,971
They might.
They just might.

881
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:16,978
It's not personal, Sonny.

882
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:19,479
It's strictly business.

883
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:23,150
It's as cold as they come.

884
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:26,712
Impossible to trace, so you don't
worry about prints, Mike.

885
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:29,723
I put a special tape
on the trigger and the butt.

886
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:32,325
Here. Try it.

887
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:45,505
What's the matter,
the trigger too tight?

888
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:50,845
- My ears.
- I left it noisy.

889
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:55,579
That way it scares pain-in-the-ass
innocent bystanders away.

890
01:15:55,684 --> 01:15:58,184
All right, you shot them both.
Now what do you do?

891
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:02,957
Sit down, finish my dinner.

892
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:04,625
Come on, kid.
Don't fool around.

893
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:08,187
Just let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

894
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:10,464
Everybody will still think
you got it.

895
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:12,633
They're gonna be staring
at your face, Mike...

896
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:15,694
so walk out of the place real fast,
but you don't run.

897
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:19,205
Don't look nobody directly in the
eye, but you don't look away, either.

898
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:21,309
Hey, they're gonna be scared stiff
of you, believe me...

899
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:23,810
so don't worry about nothing.

900
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:26,814
You know, you're gonna turn out all right.

901
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:29,150
You take a long vacation,
nobody knows where...

902
01:16:29,151 --> 01:16:31,651
and we're gonna catch the hell.

903
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:33,821
How bad do you think
it's gonna be?

904
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:35,823
Pretty goddamn bad.

905
01:16:35,824 --> 01:16:38,884
Probably all the other families
will line up against us.

906
01:16:38,994 --> 01:16:41,895
That's all right. These things
gotta happen every five years or so.

907
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:44,557
Ten years.
Helps to get rid of the bad blood.

908
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:47,226
Been ten years since
the last one.

909
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:49,337
You know, you gotta stop them
at the beginning...

910
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:51,505
like they should have
stopped Hitler at Munich.

911
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:53,507
They should have never let him
get away with that.

912
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:56,008
They was just asking
for big trouble.

913
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:58,905
You know, Mike,
we was all proud of you...

914
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:00,781
being a hero and all.

915
01:17:00,782 --> 01:17:03,282
Your father too.

916
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,490
Nothing.
Not a hint.

917
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:44,991
Absolutely nothing.

918
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:48,061
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting's going to be held.

919
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,831
How much time do we have?

920
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,502
Gonna pick you up in front
of Jack Dempsey's joint...

921
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:57,003
in an hour and a half...
exactly an hour and a half.

922
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:01,174
We could put a tail on them,
see how it turns out.

923
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:04,507
Sollozzo'll lose our ass
going around the block.

924
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:06,147
What about the negotiator?

925
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:08,844
He's over at my place playing
pinochle with a couple of my men.

926
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:10,751
He's happy.
They're letting him win.

927
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:14,381
It's too much of a risk for Mike.
Maybe we ought to call it off, Sonny.

928
01:18:14,489 --> 01:18:18,050
The negotiator keeps on playing cards
until Mike comes back safe and sound.

929
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:20,461
So why don't they just blast who's ever
in the goddamn car?

930
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:22,463
Too dangerous.
They'll be looking for that.

931
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:24,964
Sollozzo might not
even be in the car, Sonny.

932
01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:28,134
I get it.

933
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:39,979
Yeah.

934
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:55,728
- Louis Restaurant in the Bronx.
- Well is it reliable?

935
01:18:55,831 --> 01:18:57,665
That's my man in McCluskey's precinct.

936
01:18:57,666 --> 01:19:00,499
A police captain's got to be
on call 24 hours a day.

937
01:19:00,602 --> 01:19:03,503
He signed out at that number
between 8:00 and 10:00.

938
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:05,172
Anybody know this joint?

939
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:08,574
Yeah, sure. I do.
It's perfect for us.

940
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:10,945
A small family place, good food.

941
01:19:10,946 --> 01:19:13,779
Everyone minds his business.
It's perfect.

942
01:19:13,882 --> 01:19:16,680
Pete, they got
an old-fashioned toilet...

943
01:19:16,785 --> 01:19:20,016
You know, the box
and the chain thing.

944
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:24,183
We might be able
to tape the gun behind it.

945
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:25,793
All right.

946
01:19:25,794 --> 01:19:28,957
Mike, you go to the restaurant.

947
01:19:29,064 --> 01:19:31,465
You eat, you talk for a while,
you relax.

948
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:33,167
You make them relax.

949
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:35,536
Then you get up
and go take a leak.

950
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:38,199
No, better still,
you ask for permission to go.

951
01:19:38,306 --> 01:19:40,174
And when you come back,
you come out blasting.

952
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:43,110
And don't take any chances.
Two shots in the head apiece.

953
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:45,312
Now, listen.
I want somebody good...

954
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:47,314
and I mean very good...
to plant that gun.

955
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:50,307
I don't want my brother coming out of that
toilet with just his dick in his hands, all right?

956
01:19:50,418 --> 01:19:52,153
The gun will be there.

957
01:19:52,154 --> 01:19:56,386
All right, listen. You drive him
and you pick him up after the job.

958
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:58,991
Come on. Let's move.

959
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:01,560
Thank you, Tom.

960
01:20:03,832 --> 01:20:06,733
Did he tell you
to drop the gun right away?

961
01:20:06,835 --> 01:20:09,335
Yeah, a million times.

962
01:20:13,508 --> 01:20:16,008
Now, you don't forget...
two shots apiece in the head...

963
01:20:16,011 --> 01:20:18,179
as soon as you
come out the door.

964
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:20,680
Let's go.

965
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:26,916
How long do you think it'll be
before I can come back?

966
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:31,025
At least a year, Mike.

967
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:34,587
Listen, I'll square it with Mom, you know,
you not seeing her before you leave...

968
01:20:34,696 --> 01:20:39,099
and I'll get a message
to that girlfriend...

969
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:41,701
when I think the time is right.

970
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:49,375
Take care.

971
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:54,046
- See you, Mike.
- Okay, Tom.

972
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:27,848
I'm glad you came, Mike.

973
01:21:27,849 --> 01:21:30,349
I hope we can
straighten everything out.

974
01:21:31,019 --> 01:21:33,886
I mean, this is terrible. It's not the way
I wanted things to go at all.

975
01:21:33,989 --> 01:21:35,856
It should have never happened.

976
01:21:35,857 --> 01:21:38,025
I want to straighten
everything out tonight.

977
01:21:38,026 --> 01:21:40,526
I don't want my father
bothered anymore.

978
01:21:40,528 --> 01:21:44,589
He won't be, Mike.
I swear on my children he won't be.

979
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:47,930
But you got to keep an open mind
when we talk.

980
01:21:48,036 --> 01:21:50,536
I mean, I hope you're not a hot-head
like your brother Sonny.

981
01:21:50,538 --> 01:21:53,038
You can't talk business
with him.

982
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:56,709
He's a good kid.

983
01:22:00,048 --> 01:22:02,548
I'm sorry about
the other night, Mike.

984
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:06,152
I gotta frisk you,
so turn around, huh?

985
01:22:06,154 --> 01:22:08,654
On your knees, facing me.

986
01:22:12,494 --> 01:22:15,395
I guess I'm getting
too old for my job.

987
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:18,565
Too grouchy.

988
01:22:18,566 --> 01:22:21,228
Can't stand the aggravation.

989
01:22:21,336 --> 01:22:23,836
You know how it is.

990
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:27,173
He's clean.

991
01:22:53,034 --> 01:22:55,534
We're going to Jersey?

992
01:22:57,205 --> 01:22:59,705
Maybe.

993
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:26,832
Nice work, Lou.

994
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:05,572
How's the Italian food
in this restaurant?

995
01:24:05,573 --> 01:24:08,008
Good.
Try the veal.

996
01:24:08,009 --> 01:24:10,509
- It's the best in the city.
- I'll have it.

997
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:14,010
<i>Understand?</i>

998
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:48,382
I'm gonna speak Italian to Mike.

999
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:50,883
Go ahead.

1000
01:24:55,783 --> 01:24:58,283
- I'm sorry.
- Forget about it.

1001
01:25:01,284 --> 01:25:07,284
What happened to
your father was business.

1002
01:25:09,285 --> 01:25:12,285
I have much respect for your father...

1003
01:25:12,286 --> 01:25:16,286
but your father's thinking
is old fashioned.

1004
01:25:17,287 --> 01:25:21,287
You must understand why
I did what I did.

1005
01:25:22,288 --> 01:25:25,288
I understand these things.

1006
01:25:25,789 --> 01:25:27,489
I do.

1007
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:29,990
You do.

1008
01:25:40,491 --> 01:25:44,491
Now we have to think about what happens

1009
01:25:44,792 --> 01:25:48,692
between you and the Tattaglias.

1010
01:25:49,492 --> 01:25:53,492
We have to work through

1011
01:25:53,493 --> 01:25:57,493
where we go from here.

1012
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:07,493
How do I say...?

1013
01:26:09,297 --> 01:26:11,797
What I want...

1014
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:14,466
what's most important to me...

1015
01:26:16,804 --> 01:26:18,972
is that I have a guarantee:

1016
01:26:18,973 --> 01:26:21,141
no more attempts
on my father's life.

1017
01:26:21,142 --> 01:26:25,374
What guarantees could I give you, Mike?
I am the hunted one.

1018
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:29,040
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

1019
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:31,650
I'm not that clever.

1020
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:35,320
All I want is a truce.

1021
01:26:41,829 --> 01:26:45,526
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is that all right?

1022
01:26:46,834 --> 01:26:49,334
You gotta go, you gotta go.

1023
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:56,610
I frisked him.
He's clean.

1024
01:26:56,611 --> 01:26:59,111
Don't take too long.

1025
01:27:02,283 --> 01:27:04,783
I've frisked a thousand young punks.

1026
01:28:20,081 --> 01:28:22,581
Everything all right?

1027
01:28:23,582 --> 01:28:26,082
I respect myself - understand?

1028
01:28:26,083 --> 01:28:29,083
and so I cannot allow your
father to hold me back.

1029
01:28:29,884 --> 01:28:32,884
What happened was unavoidable.

1030
01:28:33,885 --> 01:28:36,385
I had the unspoken support of
the other Dons.

1031
01:28:36,386 --> 01:28:38,886
If your father were in better health...

1032
01:28:38,887 --> 01:28:41,387
without his eldest son running things...

1033
01:30:55,216 --> 01:30:56,716
Hey, come on.

1034
01:30:56,717 --> 01:30:59,217
Come on. Let's go.

1035
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:57,376
Joe, you take over.

1036
01:32:00,214 --> 01:32:02,714
Hi, Grandpa.

1037
01:32:14,161 --> 01:32:16,661
I love you, Grandpa.

1038
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:21,396
I'm sorry, Pa.
He doesn't know you yet.

1039
01:32:23,137 --> 01:32:26,001
- Here you are, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

1040
01:32:26,007 --> 01:32:28,174
"I hope you get red, Grandpa...

1041
01:32:28,175 --> 01:32:30,176
and I wish
I would see you soon.

1042
01:32:30,177 --> 01:32:32,677
Love, your grandson, Frank."

1043
01:32:35,182 --> 01:32:37,517
Go with your mother.

1044
01:32:37,518 --> 01:32:40,018
Go ahead.
Take 'em downstairs.

1045
01:32:45,693 --> 01:32:48,193
Go on, Carlo. You too.

1046
01:32:49,530 --> 01:32:52,030
Go on.

1047
01:32:54,535 --> 01:32:57,766
I got chicken cacciatore
for you, sweetheart.

1048
01:32:57,872 --> 01:32:59,773
- That's enough bread.
- I like bread.

1049
01:32:59,774 --> 01:33:02,274
I know, but how much can you eat?

1050
01:33:11,819 --> 01:33:13,820
What's the matter with you, Carlo?

1051
01:33:13,821 --> 01:33:16,321
Shut up and set the table.

1052
01:33:31,505 --> 01:33:34,065
Since McCluskey's killing...

1053
01:33:34,175 --> 01:33:37,576
the police have been cracking down
most of our operations.

1054
01:33:39,347 --> 01:33:41,847
And also the other families'.

1055
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:44,150
Been a lot of bad blood.

1056
01:33:44,151 --> 01:33:47,643
They hit us, so we hit them back.

1057
01:33:48,522 --> 01:33:50,690
Through our contacts
in the newspapers...

1058
01:33:50,691 --> 01:33:53,026
we've been able to put out
a lot of material...

1059
01:33:53,027 --> 01:33:56,428
about McCluskey being linked
with Sollozzo in the drug rackets.

1060
01:33:57,698 --> 01:34:00,198
See, things are
starting to loosen up.

1061
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:05,534
Dad, I'm sending Fredo
to Las Vegas...

1062
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,234
under the protection
of Don Francesco of L.A.

1063
01:34:08,342 --> 01:34:10,310
I want him to rest.

1064
01:34:10,311 --> 01:34:12,811
I'm going to learn
the casino business.

1065
01:34:12,813 --> 01:34:15,313
Yeah.

1066
01:34:20,988 --> 01:34:23,488
Where is Michael?

1067
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:37,930
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

1068
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:44,072
But he's safe. We're starting
to work to bring him back now.

1069
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:07,967
I want you to find out where that
little pimp Tattaglia is hiding.

1070
01:35:07,968 --> 01:35:09,969
I want his ass now...
right now.

1071
01:35:09,970 --> 01:35:11,805
- Hey, Sonny.
- What?

1072
01:35:11,806 --> 01:35:13,640
Things are starting to loosen up
a little bit.

1073
01:35:13,641 --> 01:35:16,371
If you go after Tattaglia,
all hell's going to break loose.

1074
01:35:16,477 --> 01:35:18,478
Let the smoke clear.
Pop can negotiate.

1075
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:20,979
No, Pop can't do nothing till
he's better. I'm gonna decide what...

1076
01:35:20,981 --> 01:35:22,982
All right, but your war's
costing us a lot of money.

1077
01:35:22,983 --> 01:35:24,818
Nothing's coming in.
We can't do business.

1078
01:35:24,819 --> 01:35:27,549
Well neither can they.
Don't worry about it.

1079
01:35:27,655 --> 01:35:29,656
- We can't afford a stalemate.
- Well, then there ain't no more stalemate.

1080
01:35:29,657 --> 01:35:31,658
I'm gonna end it
by killing that old bastard.

1081
01:35:31,659 --> 01:35:33,827
You're getting a great reputation.
I hope you're enjoying it.

1082
01:35:33,828 --> 01:35:35,495
Well you just do what I tell you to do!

1083
01:35:35,496 --> 01:35:37,664
Goddamn it, if I had a wartime
consigliere, a Sicilian,

1084
01:35:37,665 --> 01:35:39,666
I wouldn't be in this shape!

1085
01:35:39,667 --> 01:35:42,167
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

1086
01:35:45,506 --> 01:35:48,006
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

1087
01:35:49,009 --> 01:35:52,035
Mom made a little dinner.
It's Sunday.

1088
01:35:53,013 --> 01:35:55,743
Them niggers are having
a good time...

1089
01:35:55,850 --> 01:35:57,517
with our policy banks
up there in Harlem.

1090
01:35:57,518 --> 01:36:01,352
Driving them new Cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.

1091
01:36:01,455 --> 01:36:04,856
I knew that was gonna happen as soon
as they started making big money.

1092
01:36:04,959 --> 01:36:08,520
Look, Papa never talked business
at the table in front of the kids.

1093
01:36:08,629 --> 01:36:11,359
- Hey, shut up, Connie.
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

1094
01:36:11,465 --> 01:36:14,525
- You got that?
- Santino, don't interfere.

1095
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:19,030
You know, Sonny, Tom, I'd like to talk
to you, maybe after dinner.

1096
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:21,141
I could be doing a lot more
for the family.

1097
01:36:21,142 --> 01:36:23,642
We don't discuss business
at the table.

1098
01:37:16,564 --> 01:37:18,064
Michael

1099
01:37:48,565 --> 01:37:51,065
Corleone.

1100
01:38:20,566 --> 01:38:22,566
Look there. Corleone.

1101
01:38:59,903 --> 01:39:03,236
Hey, American!
Take me to the America! G.I.!

1102
01:39:03,803 --> 01:39:04,803
Hey, hey, hey!

1103
01:39:04,842 --> 01:39:07,902
Take me to America, G.I.
Clark Gable.

1104
01:39:08,403 --> 01:39:09,903
America! America!

1105
01:39:09,904 --> 01:39:11,404
Take me to the America, G.I.

1106
01:39:11,405 --> 01:39:13,405
Clark Gable.
Rita Hayworth.

1107
01:40:06,723 --> 01:40:08,723
Hey, host.

1108
01:40:10,424 --> 01:40:12,424
A bottle of wine.

1109
01:42:07,724 --> 01:42:10,224
I apologize if I offended you.

1110
01:42:11,061 --> 01:42:13,561
I'm a stranger in this country...

1111
01:42:14,064 --> 01:42:16,965
and I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

1112
01:42:22,739 --> 01:42:25,239
I'm an American hiding in Sicily.

1113
01:42:26,910 --> 01:42:29,410
My name is Michael Corleone.

1114
01:42:31,248 --> 01:42:33,748
There are people who would pay
a lot of money for that information.

1115
01:42:37,754 --> 01:42:40,254
But then your daughter
would lose a father...

1116
01:42:42,192 --> 01:42:44,692
instead of gaining a husband.

1117
01:42:52,436 --> 01:42:54,936
I want to meet your daughter...

1118
01:42:55,772 --> 01:42:57,606
with your permission...

1119
01:42:57,607 --> 01:43:00,107
and under the supervision
of your family...

1120
01:43:01,044 --> 01:43:03,544
with all respect.

1121
01:43:21,231 --> 01:43:23,731
Apollonia.

1122
01:44:18,232 --> 01:44:21,232
...this is my daughter, Apollonia...

1123
01:44:21,233 --> 01:44:24,233
and this is Michael Corleone.

1124
01:44:40,234 --> 01:44:42,234
Thank you.

1125
01:44:42,835 --> 01:44:44,835
Your welcome.

1126
01:44:54,836 --> 01:44:57,336
What's the problem with your eye.

1127
01:44:57,837 --> 01:45:00,337
No, no. It's nothing. It's fine.

1128
01:46:15,038 --> 01:46:17,538
Hey! I'm gonna knock you dizzy.

1129
01:46:23,046 --> 01:46:25,546
Save it for the library.

1130
01:46:28,685 --> 01:46:31,185
Come on. We gotta go
pick up my sister. Let's go.

1131
01:46:49,406 --> 01:46:51,906
What's the matter?

1132
01:46:53,707 --> 01:46:55,707
What's the matter?

1133
01:46:56,913 --> 01:46:59,081
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

1134
01:46:59,082 --> 01:47:02,483
Sonny, please. It was my fault.
Sonny, it was my fault. I hit him.

1135
01:47:02,586 --> 01:47:04,520
I started a fight with him.
Please, Sonny.

1136
01:47:04,521 --> 01:47:07,021
I'm sorry.

1137
01:47:10,995 --> 01:47:14,325
Okay, I'm just...I'm just gonna get a doctor
to come and take a look at you.

1138
01:47:14,531 --> 01:47:17,261
Sonny, please don't do anything.
Please, don't do it.

1139
01:47:19,369 --> 01:47:21,537
What's the matter with you?
What am I gonna do?

1140
01:47:21,538 --> 01:47:24,336
Am I gonna make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

1141
01:47:27,210 --> 01:47:28,711
All right?

1142
01:47:28,712 --> 01:47:31,806
Still betting the Yankees
pretty heavy?

1143
01:47:31,915 --> 01:47:34,415
Tell him to stop
taking action, all right?

1144
01:47:35,585 --> 01:47:38,085
You lost enough money
last weekend to me.

1145
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:46,460
Carlo, come here.

1146
01:48:43,553 --> 01:48:46,283
You touch my sister again,
I'll kill you.

1147
01:52:41,624 --> 01:52:44,354
Weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

1148
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:48,760
Yes, well, I have.
I mean I've tried writing and calling.

1149
01:52:48,865 --> 01:52:51,233
Now, I wanna reach Michael.

1150
01:52:51,234 --> 01:52:54,635
Nobody knows where he is. We know
that he's all right, but that's all.

1151
01:52:57,907 --> 01:52:59,908
- What was that?
- That's an accident.

1152
01:52:59,909 --> 01:53:02,605
But nobody was hurt.

1153
01:53:02,679 --> 01:53:03,679
Tom...

1154
01:53:04,180 --> 01:53:08,014
Would you give this letter
to Michael, please? Please?

1155
01:53:08,117 --> 01:53:10,452
Well, if I accepted that...

1156
01:53:10,453 --> 01:53:14,014
in a court of law they could prove that
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

1157
01:53:14,123 --> 01:53:16,325
Now you just be patient, Kay.
He'll get in touch with you, all right?

1158
01:53:16,326 --> 01:53:20,228
I let my cab go, so can I come in
to call another one, please?

1159
01:53:20,330 --> 01:53:22,830
Come on. I'm sorry.
Come on.

1160
01:53:39,148 --> 01:53:41,648
Hello?

1161
01:53:43,219 --> 01:53:44,987
<i>Is Carlo there?</i>

1162
01:53:44,988 --> 01:53:47,456
<i>- Who's this?
- This is a friend of Carlo's.</i>

1163
01:53:47,457 --> 01:53:50,517
<i>Would you tell him that
I can't make it tonight until later?</i>

1164
01:53:56,733 --> 01:53:59,233
Bitch.

1165
01:54:00,003 --> 01:54:02,597
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry yet.

1166
01:54:02,705 --> 01:54:04,706
Your food is on the table.
It's getting cold.

1167
01:54:04,707 --> 01:54:07,767
- I'll eat out later.
- You just told me to make you dinner.

1168
01:54:07,877 --> 01:54:09,878
Hey, fuck you, eh?

1169
01:54:09,879 --> 01:54:12,379
Go fuck yourself!

1170
01:54:17,086 --> 01:54:19,586
This little guinea brat.

1171
01:54:23,993 --> 01:54:26,587
That's it. Break it all,
you spoiled guinea brat.

1172
01:54:26,696 --> 01:54:29,196
Break it all!

1173
01:54:31,901 --> 01:54:34,401
That's it. Break it all.

1174
01:54:37,507 --> 01:54:41,705
Why don't you bring
your whore home for dinner?

1175
01:54:41,811 --> 01:54:44,311
Maybe I will.
Why not?

1176
01:54:49,986 --> 01:54:52,454
- Now clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

1177
01:54:52,455 --> 01:54:54,955
Clean it up,
you guinea spoiled brat!

1178
01:54:54,957 --> 01:54:57,457
Clean it up!
Clean it up!

1179
01:55:01,864 --> 01:55:04,364
You son of a bitch!

1180
01:55:13,042 --> 01:55:16,136
Come on, now! Kill me!
Be a murderer like your father!

1181
01:55:16,245 --> 01:55:18,580
- Come on! All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

1182
01:55:18,581 --> 01:55:20,315
- Come on!
- I'll kill you!

1183
01:55:20,316 --> 01:55:22,816
Kill me!
Get up!

1184
01:55:22,819 --> 01:55:24,453
Get out of here!

1185
01:55:24,454 --> 01:55:27,946
- I hate you!
- Now go ahead. Now I'll kill you.

1186
01:55:28,057 --> 01:55:30,058
You guinea brat, you.

1187
01:55:30,059 --> 01:55:32,559
Get out here!

1188
01:55:41,404 --> 01:55:44,339
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you. What is it?

1189
01:55:45,508 --> 01:55:48,375
Honey, talk louder.
The baby's crying.

1190
01:55:48,478 --> 01:55:50,512
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

1191
01:55:50,513 --> 01:55:52,581
I don't understand.

1192
01:55:52,582 --> 01:55:55,082
Yeah, Connie.

1193
01:55:59,622 --> 01:56:02,122
Listen, you wait there.

1194
01:56:03,993 --> 01:56:06,493
No, you just wait there.

1195
01:56:08,297 --> 01:56:11,198
- That son of a bitch.
- Sonny, what's the matter?

1196
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:13,435
- Son of a bitch!
- What's the matter?

1197
01:56:13,436 --> 01:56:15,936
Damn it!

1198
01:56:18,107 --> 01:56:20,735
Open the goddamn gate.
Get off your ass.

1199
01:56:37,260 --> 01:56:40,093
- Sonny, come on!
- Get out of here!

1200
01:56:40,196 --> 01:56:42,696
Go after him.
Go on.

1201
01:57:11,093 --> 01:57:13,028
Son of a bitch.

1202
01:57:13,029 --> 01:57:15,529
Come on! Come on!

1203
01:59:02,605 --> 01:59:05,105
Give me a drop.

1204
01:59:12,715 --> 01:59:15,215
My wife is crying upstairs.

1205
01:59:17,386 --> 01:59:19,886
I hear cars coming to the house.

1206
01:59:24,460 --> 01:59:26,960
Consigliere of mine...

1207
01:59:27,830 --> 01:59:30,765
I think you should tell your Don
what everyone seems to know.

1208
01:59:30,866 --> 01:59:33,366
Well, I didn't tell Mama anything.

1209
01:59:34,570 --> 01:59:38,097
I was about to come up and wake you
just now and tell you.

1210
01:59:41,243 --> 01:59:43,743
But you needed a drink first.

1211
01:59:50,319 --> 01:59:52,819
Now you've had your drink.

1212
01:59:58,361 --> 02:00:02,525
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

1213
02:00:19,815 --> 02:00:22,315
I want all inquiries made.

1214
02:00:26,489 --> 02:00:28,989
I want no acts of vengeance.

1215
02:00:30,526 --> 02:00:33,026
I want you to arrange a meeting...

1216
02:00:34,330 --> 02:00:36,830
with the heads
of the five families.

1217
02:00:39,068 --> 02:00:41,568
This war stops now.

1218
02:01:03,025 --> 02:01:05,550
Call Bonasera.

1219
02:01:05,661 --> 02:01:08,161
We need him now.

1220
02:01:20,009 --> 02:01:22,978
This is Tom Hagen
calling for Vito Corleone...

1221
02:01:23,079 --> 02:01:25,180
at his request.

1222
02:01:25,181 --> 02:01:27,482
Now, you owe your Don a service.

1223
02:01:27,483 --> 02:01:31,317
<i>He has no doubt that
you will repay it.</i>

1224
02:01:31,420 --> 02:01:34,184
<i>Now, he will be at your
funeral parlor in one hour.</i>

1225
02:01:34,290 --> 02:01:36,790
<i>Be there to greet him.</i>

1226
02:01:57,012 --> 02:01:59,347
Well, my friend...

1227
02:01:59,348 --> 02:02:01,816
are you ready
to do me this service?

1228
02:02:01,817 --> 02:02:03,485
Yes.

1229
02:02:03,486 --> 02:02:06,011
What do you want me to do?

1230
02:02:13,362 --> 02:02:16,388
I want you to use
all your powers...

1231
02:02:16,499 --> 02:02:18,999
and all your skills.

1232
02:02:22,004 --> 02:02:24,504
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

1233
02:02:41,056 --> 02:02:43,556
Look how they massacred my boy.

1234
02:03:18,427 --> 02:03:20,328
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday...

1235
02:03:20,329 --> 02:03:22,957
Wednesday, Friday,
Sunday, Saturday.

1236
02:04:55,357 --> 02:04:57,857
- Fabrizio.
- Yes, sir?

1237
02:04:58,994 --> 02:05:00,662
Are you driving yourself, boss?

1238
02:05:00,663 --> 02:05:02,964
- Yes.
- Is your wife coming with you?

1239
02:05:02,965 --> 02:05:06,526
No. I want you to take her to her father's
house till I know things are safe.

1240
02:05:06,635 --> 02:05:09,135
Okay. Anything you say, boss.

1241
02:06:18,173 --> 02:06:20,108
Don Barzini,
I want to thank you...

1242
02:06:20,109 --> 02:06:23,636
for helping me organize
this meeting here today.

1243
02:06:23,746 --> 02:06:27,113
And also the other heads
of the five families...

1244
02:06:27,216 --> 02:06:29,716
from New York and New Jersey.

1245
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:33,745
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx.

1246
02:06:36,225 --> 02:06:38,725
From Brooklyn...

1247
02:06:38,894 --> 02:06:41,394
Philip Tattaglia.

1248
02:06:42,798 --> 02:06:45,631
And from Staten Island...

1249
02:06:45,734 --> 02:06:48,999
we have with us Victor Strachi.

1250
02:06:49,104 --> 02:06:51,604
And all the other associates
that came as far...

1251
02:06:51,673 --> 02:06:54,801
as from California
and Kansas City...

1252
02:06:54,910 --> 02:06:57,345
and all the other territories
of the country.

1253
02:06:57,346 --> 02:06:59,846
Thank you.

1254
02:07:05,454 --> 02:07:07,954
How did things ever get so far?

1255
02:07:08,991 --> 02:07:11,491
I don't know.

1256
02:07:12,728 --> 02:07:16,220
It was so unfortunate
and so unnecessary.

1257
02:07:19,301 --> 02:07:21,536
Tattaglia lost a son...

1258
02:07:21,537 --> 02:07:24,037
and I lost a son.

1259
02:07:24,773 --> 02:07:28,368
We're quits,
and if Tattaglia agrees...

1260
02:07:28,477 --> 02:07:32,538
then I'm willing to let things
go on the way they were before.

1261
02:07:34,183 --> 02:07:37,710
We are all grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

1262
02:07:37,820 --> 02:07:40,516
We all know him
as a man of his word.

1263
02:07:40,622 --> 02:07:42,857
A modest man.
He'll always listen to reason.

1264
02:07:42,858 --> 02:07:45,358
Yes, Don Barzini.

1265
02:07:45,394 --> 02:07:47,462
He's too modest.

1266
02:07:47,463 --> 02:07:50,432
He had all the judges
and politicians in his pocket.

1267
02:07:51,834 --> 02:07:54,667
He refused to share them.

1268
02:07:54,770 --> 02:07:57,762
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

1269
02:07:58,640 --> 02:08:01,140
All of you know me here.

1270
02:08:02,010 --> 02:08:06,037
When did I ever refuse,
except one time?

1271
02:08:06,148 --> 02:08:08,648
And why?

1272
02:08:08,817 --> 02:08:11,317
Because I believe
this drug business...

1273
02:08:11,420 --> 02:08:14,548
is going to destroy us
in the years to come.

1274
02:08:14,656 --> 02:08:18,387
I mean, it's not like gambling
or liquor or even women...

1275
02:08:18,494 --> 02:08:21,224
which is something that
most people want nowadays...

1276
02:08:21,330 --> 02:08:24,788
and is forbidden to them by
the pezzonovante of the church.

1277
02:08:24,900 --> 02:08:27,994
Even the police departments
that have helped us in the past...

1278
02:08:28,103 --> 02:08:29,937
with gambling and other things...

1279
02:08:29,938 --> 02:08:34,068
are gonna refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

1280
02:08:34,176 --> 02:08:37,111
And I believed that then...

1281
02:08:37,212 --> 02:08:39,347
and I believe that now.

1282
02:08:39,348 --> 02:08:41,649
Times have changed.

1283
02:08:41,650 --> 02:08:43,918
It's not like the old days...

1284
02:08:43,919 --> 02:08:46,419
when we could do
anything we want.

1285
02:08:46,455 --> 02:08:49,356
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

1286
02:08:49,458 --> 02:08:53,394
If Don Corleone had all the judges
and the politicians in New York...

1287
02:08:53,495 --> 02:08:56,487
then he must share them
or let others use them.

1288
02:08:56,598 --> 02:08:59,761
He must let us draw
the water from the well.

1289
02:09:00,702 --> 02:09:04,263
Certainly, he can present a bill
for such services.

1290
02:09:04,373 --> 02:09:07,103
After all, we are not Communists.

1291
02:09:10,078 --> 02:09:13,138
I also don't believe in drugs.

1292
02:09:13,248 --> 02:09:15,483
For years,
I paid my people extra...

1293
02:09:15,484 --> 02:09:17,885
so they wouldn't do
that kind of business.

1294
02:09:17,886 --> 02:09:21,322
Somebody comes to them and says,
"I have powders.

1295
02:09:21,423 --> 02:09:24,153
If you put up a three, four
thousand dollar investment,

1296
02:09:25,127 --> 02:09:27,789
we can make 50,000 distributing."

1297
02:09:28,897 --> 02:09:32,697
So they can't resist. I want
to control it as a business...

1298
02:09:32,801 --> 02:09:35,269
to keep it respectable.

1299
02:09:35,270 --> 02:09:39,798
I don't want it near schools.
I don't want it sold to children.

1300
02:09:39,908 --> 02:09:42,408
That's an infamia.

1301
02:09:42,945 --> 02:09:46,881
In my city, we would keep the traffic
in the dark people, the colored.

1302
02:09:46,982 --> 02:09:49,849
They're animals anyway,
so let them lose their souls.

1303
02:09:56,825 --> 02:10:00,124
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

1304
02:10:01,863 --> 02:10:05,026
And as a reasonable man, I'm willing
to do whatever's necessary...

1305
02:10:05,133 --> 02:10:08,625
to find a peaceful solution
to these problems.

1306
02:10:08,737 --> 02:10:10,905
Then we are agreed.

1307
02:10:10,906 --> 02:10:13,341
The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

1308
02:10:13,342 --> 02:10:15,902
And Don Corleone will give our
protection in the east...

1309
02:10:16,011 --> 02:10:17,945
and there will be the peace.

1310
02:10:17,946 --> 02:10:21,814
But I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

1311
02:10:21,917 --> 02:10:25,080
As time goes by and
his position becomes stronger...

1312
02:10:25,187 --> 02:10:27,712
will he attempt
any individual vendetta?

1313
02:10:27,823 --> 02:10:29,890
Look, we are all
reasonable men here.

1314
02:10:29,891 --> 02:10:33,327
We don't have to give assurances
as if we were lawyers.

1315
02:10:33,428 --> 02:10:35,663
You talk about vengeance.

1316
02:10:35,664 --> 02:10:38,929
Is vengeance gonna bring
your son back to you?

1317
02:10:39,034 --> 02:10:41,534
Or my boy to me?

1318
02:10:42,204 --> 02:10:44,704
I forego the vengeance of my son.

1319
02:10:47,843 --> 02:10:50,343
But I have selfish reasons.

1320
02:10:52,347 --> 02:10:54,382
My youngest son...

1321
02:10:54,383 --> 02:10:56,883
was forced to leave this country...

1322
02:10:57,886 --> 02:11:00,386
because of this Sollozzo business.

1323
02:11:00,856 --> 02:11:03,689
All right.
And I have to make arrangements...

1324
02:11:03,792 --> 02:11:08,422
to bring him back here safely,
cleared of all these false charges.

1325
02:11:10,065 --> 02:11:13,091
But I'm a superstitious man.

1326
02:11:13,201 --> 02:11:15,761
And if some unlucky accident
should befall him...

1327
02:11:15,871 --> 02:11:19,602
if he should get shot
in the head by a police officer...

1328
02:11:19,708 --> 02:11:23,542
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell...

1329
02:11:23,645 --> 02:11:26,145
of if he's struck
by a bolt of lightening...

1330
02:11:27,783 --> 02:11:30,809
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

1331
02:11:33,021 --> 02:11:35,521
And that I do not forgive.

1332
02:11:37,859 --> 02:11:40,359
But that aside...

1333
02:11:43,298 --> 02:11:45,798
let me say that I swear...

1334
02:11:47,235 --> 02:11:50,329
on the souls of my grandchildren...

1335
02:11:50,439 --> 02:11:53,966
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1336
02:12:20,368 --> 02:12:22,369
When I meet with the Tattaglia
people, should I insist...

1337
02:12:22,370 --> 02:12:25,737
that all these drug middlemen
have clean records?

1338
02:12:25,841 --> 02:12:28,341
Mention it.
Don't insist.

1339
02:12:30,178 --> 02:12:32,678
Barzini is a man who'll know that
without being told.

1340
02:12:34,015 --> 02:12:36,609
You mean Tattaglia.

1341
02:12:36,718 --> 02:12:39,448
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1342
02:12:39,554 --> 02:12:42,054
He never could've outfought Santino.

1343
02:12:45,393 --> 02:12:49,056
But I didn't know until this day
that it was...

1344
02:12:49,164 --> 02:12:51,664
Barzini all along.

1345
02:13:06,314 --> 02:13:08,814
Come on, Nancy.

1346
02:13:09,518 --> 02:13:12,018
Keep together, everyone.
Brian?

1347
02:13:13,388 --> 02:13:15,888
Okay. All right.

1348
02:13:28,436 --> 02:13:30,961
How long have you been back?

1349
02:13:31,072 --> 02:13:33,572
I've been back a year.

1350
02:13:34,509 --> 02:13:37,034
Longer than that, I think.

1351
02:13:39,281 --> 02:13:41,781
It's good to see you, Kay.

1352
02:13:47,689 --> 02:13:50,189
Hi, Miss Adams!

1353
02:13:52,527 --> 02:13:55,027
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

1354
02:13:57,666 --> 02:13:59,700
He's been sick.

1355
02:13:59,701 --> 02:14:02,136
Very sick.

1356
02:14:02,137 --> 02:14:04,238
But you're not like him, Michael.

1357
02:14:04,239 --> 02:14:06,764
I thought you weren't going
to become a man like your father.

1358
02:14:06,875 --> 02:14:09,375
That's what you told me.

1359
02:14:09,911 --> 02:14:12,641
My father's no different
than any other powerful man.

1360
02:14:14,316 --> 02:14:17,877
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1361
02:14:18,987 --> 02:14:21,487
Like a senator or a president.

1362
02:14:21,489 --> 02:14:24,014
- Do you know how naive you sound?
- Why?

1363
02:14:24,125 --> 02:14:26,719
Senators and presidents
don't have men killed.

1364
02:14:28,064 --> 02:14:29,064
Oh.

1365
02:14:30,065 --> 02:14:32,565
Who's being naive, Kay?

1366
02:14:33,201 --> 02:14:35,436
Kay, my father's way
of doing things is over.

1367
02:14:35,437 --> 02:14:38,929
It's finished.
Even he knows that.

1368
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:41,075
I mean, in five years
the Corleone family...

1369
02:14:41,076 --> 02:14:43,576
is going to be completely legitimate.

1370
02:14:45,347 --> 02:14:48,214
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business.

1371
02:14:48,215 --> 02:14:49,215
Kay.

1372
02:14:50,685 --> 02:14:53,053
Michael, why did you come here?

1373
02:14:53,054 --> 02:14:55,256
Why?

1374
02:14:55,257 --> 02:14:57,324
What do you want with me
after all this time...

1375
02:14:57,325 --> 02:14:59,850
without even calling or writing?

1376
02:14:59,961 --> 02:15:01,962
I came here because I need you.

1377
02:15:01,963 --> 02:15:04,488
- Because I care for you.
- Please stop it, Michael.

1378
02:15:04,599 --> 02:15:07,727
Because I want you to marry me.

1379
02:15:09,237 --> 02:15:11,737
- It's too late. It's too late.
- Please. Kay.

1380
02:15:13,441 --> 02:15:17,309
I'll do anything you ask, anything to
make up for what's happened to us.

1381
02:15:19,114 --> 02:15:21,448
Because that's important, Kay.

1382
02:15:21,449 --> 02:15:24,941
Because what's important is that...

1383
02:15:25,053 --> 02:15:26,887
we have each other.

1384
02:15:26,888 --> 02:15:29,789
That we have a life together.

1385
02:15:29,891 --> 02:15:33,349
That we have children.
Our children.

1386
02:15:33,850 --> 02:15:34,850
Kay...

1387
02:15:35,497 --> 02:15:38,227
I need you...

1388
02:15:38,333 --> 02:15:40,833
and I love you.

1389
02:16:01,957 --> 02:16:03,958
Barzini's people
chisel my territory...

1390
02:16:03,959 --> 02:16:05,826
and we do nothing about it.

1391
02:16:05,827 --> 02:16:08,455
Pretty soon, there won't be one place
in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.

1392
02:16:08,563 --> 02:16:11,088
- Just be patient.
- I'm not askin' you for help, Mike.

1393
02:16:11,199 --> 02:16:13,724
- Just take off the handcuffs.
- Be patient.

1394
02:16:13,835 --> 02:16:15,970
We gotta protect ourselves.

1395
02:16:15,971 --> 02:16:17,972
Give me a chance to recruit
some new men.

1396
02:16:17,973 --> 02:16:19,606
No.

1397
02:16:19,607 --> 02:16:22,107
I don't wanna give Barzini
an excuse to start fighting.

1398
02:16:22,177 --> 02:16:24,702
Mike, you're wrong.

1399
02:16:24,813 --> 02:16:28,442
Don Corleone, you once said
that the day would come...

1400
02:16:28,550 --> 02:16:31,246
when Tessio and me
could form our own family.

1401
02:16:31,353 --> 02:16:33,354
Till today,
I would never think of it.

1402
02:16:33,355 --> 02:16:35,723
I must ask your permission.

1403
02:16:35,724 --> 02:16:38,955
Well, Michael is now
head of the family...

1404
02:16:39,060 --> 02:16:41,756
and if he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1405
02:16:43,331 --> 02:16:45,831
After we make the move to Nevada...

1406
02:16:45,934 --> 02:16:48,926
you can break off from the Corleone
family and go on your own.

1407
02:16:49,037 --> 02:16:51,835
- After we make the move to Nevada.
- How long will that be?

1408
02:16:53,074 --> 02:16:54,708
Six months.

1409
02:16:54,709 --> 02:16:58,167
Forgive me, Godfather,
but with you gone...

1410
02:16:58,279 --> 02:17:01,248
me and Pete'll come under
Barzini's thumb sooner or later.

1411
02:17:01,349 --> 02:17:03,849
And I hate that goddamn Barzini.

1412
02:17:03,885 --> 02:17:06,820
In six months' time, there won't be
nothing left to build on.

1413
02:17:06,921 --> 02:17:09,913
- You have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.

1414
02:17:10,025 --> 02:17:12,823
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Yes, always, Godfather.

1415
02:17:12,927 --> 02:17:15,195
Then be a friend to Michael...

1416
02:17:15,196 --> 02:17:17,696
and do as he says.

1417
02:17:21,136 --> 02:17:23,337
There are things being negotiated
now that are going to solve...

1418
02:17:23,338 --> 02:17:26,432
all your problems
and answer all your questions.

1419
02:17:26,541 --> 02:17:29,041
That's all I can tell you now.

1420
02:17:29,544 --> 02:17:32,172
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1421
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:35,443
When we make our move there,
you're gonna be my right-hand man.

1422
02:17:35,550 --> 02:17:38,246
Tom Hagen's no longer consigliere.

1423
02:17:38,353 --> 02:17:40,853
He's gonna be our lawyer in Vegas.

1424
02:17:40,855 --> 02:17:43,323
That's no reflection on Tom,
but that's the way I want it.

1425
02:17:43,324 --> 02:17:45,259
Besides, if I ever need help...

1426
02:17:45,260 --> 02:17:47,561
who's a better consigliere
than my father?

1427
02:17:47,562 --> 02:17:50,062
Now that's it.

1428
02:18:08,149 --> 02:18:10,649
- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1429
02:18:12,055 --> 02:18:16,285
Mike, ehh...
Why am I out?

1430
02:18:16,391 --> 02:18:18,891
You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.

1431
02:18:20,462 --> 02:18:22,962
Things may get rough
with the move we're trying.

1432
02:18:23,663 --> 02:18:24,663
Tom...

1433
02:18:30,238 --> 02:18:32,506
I advised Michael.

1434
02:18:32,507 --> 02:18:35,408
I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1435
02:18:35,510 --> 02:18:38,775
I thought Santino was a bad Don...

1436
02:18:38,880 --> 02:18:41,148
rest in peace.

1437
02:18:41,149 --> 02:18:44,175
Michael has all my confidence,
as, as you do.

1438
02:18:45,386 --> 02:18:48,913
But there are reasons why
you must have no part...

1439
02:18:49,023 --> 02:18:51,258
in what is going to happen.

1440
02:18:51,259 --> 02:18:52,759
Maybe I could help.

1441
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:55,260
You're out, Tom.

1442
02:19:43,678 --> 02:19:46,203
I can't get over the way
your face looks.

1443
02:19:46,314 --> 02:19:49,477
It really looks good.
This doctor did some job.

1444
02:19:49,584 --> 02:19:52,212
Who talked you into it, Kay?
Hey, hey, wait.

1445
02:19:52,320 --> 02:19:54,721
Leave them out here.
We'll deal with them later.

1446
02:19:54,722 --> 02:19:56,723
He's tired.
He wants to clean up.

1447
02:19:56,724 --> 02:19:59,784
For right now, let me open the door.
All right?

1448
02:20:05,333 --> 02:20:07,668
Hello, Mike.
Welcome to Las Vegas.

1449
02:20:07,669 --> 02:20:10,934
All for you, kid.
It was all his idea, right?

1450
02:20:11,039 --> 02:20:13,837
- Well, your brother, Freddy...
- It was... Girls?

1451
02:20:17,579 --> 02:20:20,377
I'll be right back.
You keep them occupied.

1452
02:20:20,481 --> 02:20:23,416
That a boy.
Anything you want, kid, anything. Huh?

1453
02:20:23,518 --> 02:20:26,018
Who are the girls?

1454
02:20:26,588 --> 02:20:28,589
That's for you to find out.

1455
02:20:28,590 --> 02:20:31,457
Get rid of them, Fredo.

1456
02:20:31,559 --> 02:20:33,694
- Hey, Mike...
- Fredo, I'm here on business.

1457
02:20:33,695 --> 02:20:37,426
I leave tomorrow.
Now, get rid of them. I'm tired.

1458
02:20:37,532 --> 02:20:40,032
Get rid of the band too.

1459
02:20:45,006 --> 02:20:47,804
Hey, just take off.
Come on. Let's go.

1460
02:20:47,909 --> 02:20:51,174
Hey, that's it.
Hey, Angelo, that's it.

1461
02:20:51,279 --> 02:20:53,313
Let's go.
Hey, come on!

1462
02:20:53,314 --> 02:20:55,814
Scram!

1463
02:20:56,084 --> 02:20:58,452
Come on, honey. Let's go.
I don't know, Johnny.

1464
02:20:58,453 --> 02:21:00,621
I don't know what the hell's
the matter with him. I'm sorry.

1465
02:21:00,622 --> 02:21:02,923
It's all right, Freddy.

1466
02:21:02,924 --> 02:21:05,424
I don't know.
He's tired, he's hot.

1467
02:21:12,433 --> 02:21:14,933
What happened to Moe Greene?

1468
02:21:15,536 --> 02:21:18,036
He said he had some business.
He said give him a call...

1469
02:21:18,039 --> 02:21:20,007
when the party started.

1470
02:21:20,008 --> 02:21:22,508
Well, give him a call.

1471
02:21:23,311 --> 02:21:26,405
- Johnny, how are you?
- Hello, Mike. Nice to see you again.

1472
02:21:26,514 --> 02:21:28,682
- We're all proud of you.
- Thanks, Mike.

1473
02:21:28,683 --> 02:21:31,084
Sit down, Johnny.
I want to talk to you.

1474
02:21:31,085 --> 02:21:35,522
- The Don's proud of you, too, Johnny.
- Well, I, owe it all to him.

1475
02:21:35,623 --> 02:21:37,658
Well, he knows
how grateful you are.

1476
02:21:37,659 --> 02:21:40,719
That's why he'd like to ask
a favor of you.

1477
02:21:40,828 --> 02:21:43,328
Mike, what can I do?

1478
02:21:44,132 --> 02:21:46,632
The Corleone family is thinking
of giving up all its interests...

1479
02:21:46,701 --> 02:21:50,102
in the olive oil business,
settling out here.

1480
02:21:50,204 --> 02:21:53,469
Now, Moe Greene will sell us his
share of the casino and the hotel...

1481
02:21:53,574 --> 02:21:56,168
so it can be completely owned
by the family. Tom?

1482
02:21:56,277 --> 02:21:58,578
Hey, Mike, are you sure about that?

1483
02:21:58,579 --> 02:22:01,446
Moe loves the business. He never
said nothin' to me about sellin'.

1484
02:22:01,549 --> 02:22:04,049
Well, I'll make him an offer
he can't refuse.

1485
02:22:05,787 --> 02:22:08,221
See, Johnny...

1486
02:22:08,222 --> 02:22:10,524
see, we figure that entertainment
will be a big factor...

1487
02:22:10,525 --> 02:22:12,326
in drawing gamblers to the casino.

1488
02:22:12,327 --> 02:22:15,626
Now we hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1489
02:22:19,133 --> 02:22:22,398
Perhaps convince some of
your friends in the movies...

1490
02:22:22,503 --> 02:22:25,003
to do the same.

1491
02:22:25,073 --> 02:22:27,573
We're counting on you.

1492
02:22:29,177 --> 02:22:31,702
Sure, Mike.
I'll do anything for my godfather.

1493
02:22:31,813 --> 02:22:33,146
You know that.

1494
02:22:33,147 --> 02:22:35,647
Good.

1495
02:22:35,783 --> 02:22:38,018
Hey, Mike.
Hello, fellas.

1496
02:22:38,019 --> 02:22:41,716
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.
Good to see you, Mike.

1497
02:22:41,823 --> 02:22:43,857
- How are you, Moe?
- You got everything you want?

1498
02:22:43,858 --> 02:22:46,554
The chef cooked for you special, the
dancers will kick your tongue out...

1499
02:22:46,661 --> 02:22:48,428
and your credit is good.

1500
02:22:48,429 --> 02:22:51,057
Draw chips for everybody in the room
so they can play on the house.

1501
02:22:54,635 --> 02:22:57,135
My credit good enough
to buy you out?

1502
02:22:59,107 --> 02:23:01,041
Buy me out?

1503
02:23:01,042 --> 02:23:03,704
The casino. The hotel.

1504
02:23:03,811 --> 02:23:06,575
The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.

1505
02:23:06,681 --> 02:23:09,548
The Corleone family
wants to buy me out?

1506
02:23:09,650 --> 02:23:12,150
No, I buy you out.
You don't buy me out.

1507
02:23:12,186 --> 02:23:15,451
Your casino loses money.
Maybe we can do better.

1508
02:23:15,556 --> 02:23:18,056
You think I'm skimming
off the top, Mike?

1509
02:23:18,860 --> 02:23:21,360
You're unlucky.

1510
02:23:24,532 --> 02:23:27,000
You goddamn guineas
really make me laugh.

1511
02:23:27,001 --> 02:23:29,834
I do you a favor and take Freddy in
when you're having a bad time.

1512
02:23:29,937 --> 02:23:32,406
- And then you try to push me out!
- Wait a minute.

1513
02:23:32,407 --> 02:23:35,001
You took Freddy in because
the Corleone family...

1514
02:23:35,109 --> 02:23:37,609
bankrolled your casino,
because the Molinari family...

1515
02:23:37,712 --> 02:23:39,846
on the coast guaranteed his safety.

1516
02:23:39,847 --> 02:23:41,915
Now, we're talkin' business.
Let's talk business.

1517
02:23:41,916 --> 02:23:44,646
Yeah, let's talk business, Mike.
First of all, you're all done.

1518
02:23:44,752 --> 02:23:47,220
The Corleone family don't even have
that kind of muscle anymore.

1519
02:23:47,221 --> 02:23:49,721
The Godfather's sick, right? You're
getting chased out of New York...

1520
02:23:49,757 --> 02:23:51,558
by Barzini and the other families.

1521
02:23:51,559 --> 02:23:55,461
What do you think is going on here? You think
you can come to my hotel and take over?

1522
02:23:55,563 --> 02:23:57,397
I talked to Barzini.

1523
02:23:57,398 --> 02:24:00,663
I can make a deal with him
and still keep my hotel.

1524
02:24:00,768 --> 02:24:03,362
Is that why you slapped
my brother around in public?

1525
02:24:04,439 --> 02:24:06,140
Oh, no, that was nothin', Mike.

1526
02:24:06,441 --> 02:24:09,001
Now, now, Moe didn't mean nothin' by that.

1527
02:24:09,110 --> 02:24:11,610
Sure he flies off the handle
once in a while...

1528
02:24:11,612 --> 02:24:13,747
but Moe and me,
we're good friends, right, Moe, huh?

1529
02:24:13,748 --> 02:24:15,615
I got a business to run.

1530
02:24:15,616 --> 02:24:18,346
I gotta kick asses sometimes
to make it run right.

1531
02:24:18,453 --> 02:24:22,446
We had a little argument, Freddy and I,
so I had to straighten him out.

1532
02:24:22,557 --> 02:24:25,151
You straightened my brother out?

1533
02:24:25,259 --> 02:24:27,759
He was banging cocktail waitresses
two at a time!

1534
02:24:27,762 --> 02:24:30,663
Players couldn't get a drink at the table.
What's wrong with you?

1535
02:24:36,704 --> 02:24:40,196
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1536
02:24:40,308 --> 02:24:42,008
Son of a bitch.

1537
02:24:42,009 --> 02:24:45,035
Do you know who I am?
I'm Moe Greene.

1538
02:24:45,146 --> 02:24:47,740
I made my bones when you were
going out with cheerleaders.

1539
02:24:47,849 --> 02:24:50,349
Wait a minute, Moe.
Moe, I got an idea.

1540
02:24:51,352 --> 02:24:54,549
Tom, you're the consigliere.
Now, you can talk to the Don.

1541
02:24:54,655 --> 02:24:56,656
- You can explain...
- Just a minute.

1542
02:24:56,657 --> 02:25:00,252
The Don is semiretired and Mike is
in charge of the family business now.

1543
02:25:00,361 --> 02:25:02,921
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

1544
02:25:07,803 --> 02:25:12,398
Mike! You don't come to Las Vegas
and talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1545
02:25:14,744 --> 02:25:19,474
Fredo. You're my older brother,
and I love you.

1546
02:25:20,982 --> 02:25:23,049
But don't ever take sides
with anyone...

1547
02:25:23,050 --> 02:25:25,951
against the family again...

1548
02:25:26,053 --> 02:25:28,553
ever.

1549
02:25:35,363 --> 02:25:37,531
I have to see my father
and his people.

1550
02:25:37,532 --> 02:25:40,032
- So have dinner without me.
- Oh, Michael.

1551
02:25:41,536 --> 02:25:43,803
This weekend we'll go out.
We'll go to the city.

1552
02:25:43,804 --> 02:25:46,304
We'll see a show and we'll have dinner.
I promise.

1553
02:25:53,748 --> 02:25:56,649
Oh, Michael. Michael, your sister wants
to ask you something.

1554
02:25:56,751 --> 02:25:58,885
- Well, let her ask.
- No, she's afraid to.

1555
02:25:58,886 --> 02:26:02,117
Connie and Carlo want you to be
godfather to their little boy.

1556
02:26:02,223 --> 02:26:04,090
- Oh, we'll see.
- Will you?

1557
02:26:04,091 --> 02:26:06,591
Let me think about it. We'll see.
Come on.

1558
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:15,135
So...

1559
02:26:15,136 --> 02:26:18,105
Barzini will move against you first.

1560
02:26:18,205 --> 02:26:22,539
He'll set up a meeting with
someone that you absolutely trust...

1561
02:26:22,643 --> 02:26:25,143
guaranteeing your safety.

1562
02:26:25,980 --> 02:26:29,245
And at that meeting,
you'll be assassinated.

1563
02:26:33,888 --> 02:26:37,085
I like to drink wine
more than I used to.

1564
02:26:38,259 --> 02:26:40,427
Anyway, I'm drinking more.

1565
02:26:40,428 --> 02:26:42,928
It's good for you, Pop.

1566
02:26:46,867 --> 02:26:49,367
I don't know.

1567
02:26:50,271 --> 02:26:52,771
Your wife and children,
are you happy with them?

1568
02:26:54,175 --> 02:26:56,242
Very happy.

1569
02:26:56,243 --> 02:26:58,768
That's good.

1570
02:26:58,879 --> 02:27:01,147
I hope you don't mind
the way I...

1571
02:27:01,148 --> 02:27:03,742
I keep going over
this Barzini business.

1572
02:27:03,851 --> 02:27:05,919
No, not at all.

1573
02:27:05,920 --> 02:27:08,288
It's an old habit.

1574
02:27:08,289 --> 02:27:11,053
I spent my life
tryin' not to be careless.

1575
02:27:12,927 --> 02:27:15,760
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

1576
02:27:19,634 --> 02:27:22,194
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1577
02:27:22,303 --> 02:27:24,803
You know, he looks
more like you every day.

1578
02:27:27,608 --> 02:27:29,876
He's smarter than I am.

1579
02:27:29,877 --> 02:27:32,377
Three years old,
he can read the funny papers.

1580
02:27:34,181 --> 02:27:36,681
Reads the funny papers.

1581
02:27:43,424 --> 02:27:45,924
I want you to arrange
to have a telephone man...

1582
02:27:45,926 --> 02:27:49,054
check all the calls that go
in and out of here.

1583
02:27:49,163 --> 02:27:51,297
- I did it already, Pop.
- Could be anyone.

1584
02:27:51,298 --> 02:27:54,825
- Pop, I took care of that.
- Oh, that's right. I forgot.

1585
02:27:58,539 --> 02:28:00,940
What's the matter?

1586
02:28:00,941 --> 02:28:03,441
What's bothering you?

1587
02:28:06,213 --> 02:28:08,713
I'll handle it.

1588
02:28:09,116 --> 02:28:11,616
I told you I can handle it,
I'll handle it.

1589
02:28:24,665 --> 02:28:28,999
I knew that Santino was gonna
have to go through all this...

1590
02:28:29,103 --> 02:28:31,004
and Fredo...

1591
02:28:31,005 --> 02:28:33,473
Well...

1592
02:28:33,474 --> 02:28:35,974
Fredo was...

1593
02:28:37,511 --> 02:28:40,275
But I never, I never wanted this for you.

1594
02:28:42,550 --> 02:28:45,383
I worked my whole life...
I don't apologize...

1595
02:28:45,486 --> 02:28:47,654
to take care of my family...

1596
02:28:47,655 --> 02:28:51,523
and I refused to be a fool...

1597
02:28:51,625 --> 02:28:55,686
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1598
02:28:57,798 --> 02:29:00,961
I don't apologize. That's my life.
But I thought that...

1599
02:29:02,937 --> 02:29:05,531
that when it was your time...

1600
02:29:05,639 --> 02:29:08,139
that you would be the one
to hold the strings.

1601
02:29:09,977 --> 02:29:12,477
Senator Corleone.

1602
02:29:13,447 --> 02:29:15,615
Governor Corleone.
Something.

1603
02:29:15,616 --> 02:29:18,116
Another pezzonovante.

1604
02:29:23,624 --> 02:29:27,458
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1605
02:29:27,561 --> 02:29:30,155
We'll get there, Pop.

1606
02:29:30,264 --> 02:29:32,764
We'll get there.

1607
02:29:36,003 --> 02:29:40,372
Now listen. Whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting...

1608
02:29:40,474 --> 02:29:42,242
he's the traitor.

1609
02:29:42,243 --> 02:29:44,743
Don't forget that.

1610
02:30:00,494 --> 02:30:02,994
Put it over the tree.

1611
02:30:17,778 --> 02:30:20,246
- Can I water these?
- Yeah.

1612
02:30:20,247 --> 02:30:21,815
That's fine.

1613
02:30:21,816 --> 02:30:24,316
Over here.
Over here.

1614
02:30:26,420 --> 02:30:28,920
Be careful.
You're spilling it.

1615
02:30:35,229 --> 02:30:37,729
Anthony, come here.

1616
02:30:43,137 --> 02:30:45,637
Go ahead. That's right.
We'll put it right there.

1617
02:30:51,445 --> 02:30:53,945
I'll show you something.
Come here.

1618
02:30:56,450 --> 02:30:58,950
Now, you stand there.

1619
02:31:02,056 --> 02:31:04,556
Give me an orange!

1620
02:31:22,142 --> 02:31:24,642
That's a new trick.

1621
02:31:25,212 --> 02:31:27,772
You run in there.
Run in there.

1622
02:31:40,394 --> 02:31:42,894
- Where are you?
- Who?

1623
02:32:16,030 --> 02:32:18,530
Ouch!

1624
02:34:40,074 --> 02:34:42,574
Mike, can I have a minute?

1625
02:34:52,920 --> 02:34:55,388
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1626
02:34:55,389 --> 02:34:57,889
He says we can straighten
any of our problems out.

1627
02:34:59,560 --> 02:35:02,060
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1628
02:35:02,996 --> 02:35:05,431
I can arrange security...

1629
02:35:05,432 --> 02:35:07,932
on my territory.

1630
02:35:09,870 --> 02:35:11,871
All right?

1631
02:35:11,872 --> 02:35:14,705
- All right.
- All right.

1632
02:35:29,990 --> 02:35:32,490
Do you know how
they're gonna come at you?

1633
02:35:35,429 --> 02:35:37,864
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn.

1634
02:35:37,865 --> 02:35:40,365
Tessio's ground...

1635
02:35:41,235 --> 02:35:43,735
where I'll be safe.

1636
02:35:55,282 --> 02:35:58,877
I always thought it would've been
Clemenza, not Tessio.

1637
02:35:58,986 --> 02:36:01,354
It's the smart move.

1638
02:36:01,355 --> 02:36:03,855
Tessio was always smarter.

1639
02:36:05,058 --> 02:36:07,360
But I'm gonna wait.

1640
02:36:07,361 --> 02:36:09,861
After the baptism.

1641
02:36:11,832 --> 02:36:14,392
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

1642
02:36:15,736 --> 02:36:18,671
And then I'll meet
with Don Barzini...

1643
02:36:18,772 --> 02:36:21,240
and Tattaglia...

1644
02:36:21,241 --> 02:36:23,741
all the heads
of the five families.

1645
02:36:50,242 --> 02:36:52,242
Go forth from him, unclean spirit,

1646
02:36:52,443 --> 02:36:55,643
and give place to the Holy Spirit,
the Spirit of God.

1647
02:36:57,644 --> 02:36:58,644
Let us pray.

1648
02:36:58,645 --> 02:37:01,645
Our prayers through through
Christ our Lord. So be it.

1649
02:37:02,246 --> 02:37:03,246
Michael.

1650
02:37:03,247 --> 02:37:06,247
Signed with the sign of the Lord's cross,

1651
02:37:07,248 --> 02:37:10,248
so that, preserving this first experience
of the greatness of thy glory,

1652
02:37:10,249 --> 02:37:13,249
he may deserve, by keeping
thy commandments,

1653
02:37:13,250 --> 02:37:16,250
<i>to attain to the glory of regeneration.</i>

1654
02:37:16,251 --> 02:37:19,251
<i>Through Christ our Lord. So be it.</i>

1655
02:37:19,252 --> 02:37:22,252
<i>Let us pray.
Almighty, everlasting God,</i>

1656
02:37:22,253 --> 02:37:24,753
<i>Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</i>

1657
02:37:24,754 --> 02:37:27,754
<i>look graciously down upon this,
thy servant, Michael.</i>

1658
02:37:27,755 --> 02:37:30,755
Who shall come to judge the living
and the dead,

1659
02:37:30,756 --> 02:37:33,756
and the world by fire. So be it.

1660
02:37:33,757 --> 02:37:36,057
Michael. Receive the salt of wisdom.

1661
02:37:36,058 --> 02:37:38,358
Let it be to thee a token of mercy
unto everlasting life.

1662
02:37:38,359 --> 02:37:40,359
May it make your way easy to eternal life.
So be it.

1663
02:37:40,360 --> 02:37:42,860
May the almighty God, the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

1664
02:37:42,861 --> 02:37:45,361
<i>Who hath regenerated thee by water
and the Holy Spirit,</i>

1665
02:37:46,362 --> 02:37:48,862
<i>and who hath given thee the
remission of all thy sins,</i>

1666
02:37:49,363 --> 02:37:52,863
<i>may he, himself anoint thee with
the Chrism of Salvation,</i>

1667
02:37:52,864 --> 02:37:55,864
<i>in the same Christ Jesus our Lord,
unto life eternal. So be it.</i>

1668
02:37:56,865 --> 02:38:00,165
I annoint you with the oil of salvation
in Christ Jesus our Lord,

1669
02:38:00,466 --> 02:38:03,466
that you may have everlasting life.
So be it.

1670
02:38:10,867 --> 02:38:13,867
<i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church,</i>

1671
02:38:13,868 --> 02:38:16,868
<i>the communion of Saints,
the forgiveness of sins,</i>

1672
02:38:16,869 --> 02:38:20,369
<i>the resurrection of the body
and life everlasting? I do believe.</i>

1673
02:38:21,370 --> 02:38:24,370
I exorcise thee, unclean spirit,
in the name of the Father,

1674
02:38:24,371 --> 02:38:27,371
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,

1675
02:38:27,372 --> 02:38:31,372
that thou goest out and depart from
this servant of God, Michael.

1676
02:38:31,373 --> 02:38:34,873
For he commands thee, accursed one,

1677
02:38:36,674 --> 02:38:39,674
Be opened, for an odor of sweetness.

1678
02:38:39,675 --> 02:38:42,675
Be thou, devil, begone,

1679
02:38:42,676 --> 02:38:44,976
for the judgement of God shall draw near.

1680
02:38:45,018 --> 02:38:47,919
Michael, do you believe in God,
the Father almighty...

1681
02:38:48,021 --> 02:38:50,990
- creator of Heaven and Earth?
- I do.

1682
02:38:51,091 --> 02:38:54,390
<i>Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
his only Son, our Lord?</i>

1683
02:38:54,494 --> 02:38:55,995
<i>I do.</i>

1684
02:38:55,996 --> 02:39:00,160
<i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church?</i>

1685
02:39:00,167 --> 02:39:01,167
<i>I do.</i>

1686
02:39:01,468 --> 02:39:05,368
<i>Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.</i>

1687
02:39:05,369 --> 02:39:09,369
<i>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.</i>

1688
02:39:09,370 --> 02:39:12,170
<i>Give us this day our daily bread.</i>

1689
02:39:12,171 --> 02:39:14,171
<i>And forgive us our trespasses,</i>

1690
02:39:14,372 --> 02:39:17,465
<i>as we forgive them that
trespass against us.</i>

1691
02:39:17,466 --> 02:39:20,466
<i>And lead us not into temptation,</i>

1692
02:39:20,467 --> 02:39:22,467
<i>but deliver us from evil.
So be it.</i>

1693
02:39:22,468 --> 02:39:23,968
Michael.

1694
02:39:23,969 --> 02:39:26,969
Enter thou into the temple of God,

1695
02:39:26,970 --> 02:39:29,970
that thou mayest have part with Christ
unto life everlasting. So be it.

1696
02:39:29,971 --> 02:39:32,471
I believe in God the Father almighty,

1697
02:39:32,472 --> 02:39:34,472
Creator of heaven and earth,

1698
02:39:34,473 --> 02:39:37,973
<i>and in Jesus Christ his only
son our Lord,</i>

1699
02:39:37,974 --> 02:39:40,274
<i>who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,</i>

1700
02:39:40,275 --> 02:39:42,275
<i>born of the Virgin Mary,</i>

1701
02:39:42,276 --> 02:39:45,576
<i>suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, dead, and buried.</i>

1702
02:39:45,578 --> 02:39:48,278
<i>He descended into Hell.
On the third day,</i>

1703
02:39:48,279 --> 02:39:52,279
<i>He rose again from the dead.
He ascended into heaven,</i>

1704
02:39:52,280 --> 02:39:55,080
<i>and sitteth at the right hand of
God the Father almighty,</i>

1705
02:39:55,081 --> 02:39:57,581
<i>from thence shall he come to judge
the living and the dead.</i>

1706
02:39:57,582 --> 02:40:00,582
<i>I believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church,</i>

1707
02:40:00,583 --> 02:40:03,583
<i>the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,</i>

1708
02:40:03,584 --> 02:40:06,384
<i>the resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting. So be it.</i>

1709
02:40:06,466 --> 02:40:11,403
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

1710
02:40:17,811 --> 02:40:20,311
I do renounce him.

1711
02:40:28,622 --> 02:40:31,122
And all his works?

1712
02:40:43,336 --> 02:40:45,836
I do renounce them.

1713
02:40:50,710 --> 02:40:54,669
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

1714
02:41:10,063 --> 02:41:14,124
Michael Rizzi,
will you be baptized?

1715
02:41:14,234 --> 02:41:16,234
I will.

1716
02:41:16,235 --> 02:41:18,535
in the name of the Father,

1717
02:41:18,536 --> 02:41:20,536
<i>and of the Son,</i>

1718
02:41:20,537 --> 02:41:22,937
<i>and of the Holy Spirit.</i>

1719
02:41:23,276 --> 02:41:25,836
<i>Michael Rizzi, go in peace.</i>

1720
02:41:25,946 --> 02:41:28,972
And may the Lord be with you.
So be it.

1721
02:42:11,091 --> 02:42:13,092
- Carlo.
- What?

1722
02:42:13,093 --> 02:42:15,327
Can't go to Vegas.
Something's come up.

1723
02:42:15,328 --> 02:42:17,363
Everybody's gonna have to leave
without us.

1724
02:42:17,364 --> 02:42:19,924
- It's our first vacation together.
- Connie, please.

1725
02:42:20,033 --> 02:42:22,034
- What do you wanna do?
- Go back to the house.

1726
02:42:22,035 --> 02:42:24,902
Wait for my call.
It's important.

1727
02:42:25,005 --> 02:42:27,505
I'll only be a couple of days.

1728
02:42:29,943 --> 02:42:32,443
Have a nice trip, Mama.

1729
02:42:43,456 --> 02:42:45,956
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1730
02:42:47,794 --> 02:42:50,195
I hope Mike can get us
a good deal tonight.

1731
02:42:50,196 --> 02:42:52,696
I'm sure he will.

1732
02:42:59,439 --> 02:43:02,465
Sal, Tom, the boss says
he'll come in a separate car.

1733
02:43:02,576 --> 02:43:04,777
He says for you two
to go on ahead.

1734
02:43:04,778 --> 02:43:07,406
Hell, he can't do that.
It screws up all my arrangements.

1735
02:43:07,514 --> 02:43:10,014
- Well that's what he said.
- I can't go either, Sal.

1736
02:43:22,629 --> 02:43:25,393
Tell Mike it was only business.

1737
02:43:25,498 --> 02:43:27,998
I always liked him.

1738
02:43:28,168 --> 02:43:30,668
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

1739
02:43:37,077 --> 02:43:39,577
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

1740
02:43:40,680 --> 02:43:43,376
- For old times' sake.
- Can't do it, Sally.

1741
02:44:29,329 --> 02:44:31,829
You have to answer
for Santino, Carlo.

1742
02:44:36,736 --> 02:44:38,570
Mike, you got it all wrong.

1743
02:44:38,571 --> 02:44:41,071
You fingered Sonny
for the Barzini people.

1744
02:44:42,676 --> 02:44:45,736
That little farce you played
with my sister.

1745
02:44:45,845 --> 02:44:47,846
Did you think that could fool
a Corleone?

1746
02:44:47,847 --> 02:44:51,010
Mike, I'm innocent.
I swear on the kids.

1747
02:44:51,117 --> 02:44:53,617
- Please, don't do this to me.
- Sit down.

1748
02:44:56,756 --> 02:44:59,256
Don't do this to me, please.

1749
02:45:08,134 --> 02:45:10,634
Barzini's dead.

1750
02:45:11,805 --> 02:45:14,305
So is Phillip Tattaglia...

1751
02:45:15,508 --> 02:45:18,008
Moe Greene...

1752
02:45:18,011 --> 02:45:20,511
Stracci...

1753
02:45:21,081 --> 02:45:23,581
Cuneo.

1754
02:45:23,650 --> 02:45:27,142
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

1755
02:45:29,022 --> 02:45:31,522
Admit what you did.

1756
02:45:34,661 --> 02:45:37,161
Get him a drink.

1757
02:45:42,802 --> 02:45:45,237
Come on.

1758
02:45:45,238 --> 02:45:47,639
Don't be afraid, Carlo.

1759
02:45:47,640 --> 02:45:50,140
Come on. You think I'd make my sister
a widow?

1760
02:45:51,778 --> 02:45:54,278
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

1761
02:46:01,421 --> 02:46:02,755
Go ahead, drink.

1762
02:46:02,756 --> 02:46:05,256
Drink.

1763
02:46:08,328 --> 02:46:10,496
Now, Carlo, you're out
of the family business.

1764
02:46:10,497 --> 02:46:14,160
That's your punishment.
You're finished.

1765
02:46:14,267 --> 02:46:16,767
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

1766
02:46:23,009 --> 02:46:26,410
I want you to stay there.
Understand?

1767
02:46:26,513 --> 02:46:29,013
Only don't tell me
you're innocent...

1768
02:46:30,583 --> 02:46:33,552
because it insults my intelligence.

1769
02:46:33,653 --> 02:46:36,153
It makes me very angry.

1770
02:46:39,058 --> 02:46:42,289
Now, who approached you?

1771
02:46:42,395 --> 02:46:44,895
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1772
02:46:52,038 --> 02:46:54,538
It was Barzini.

1773
02:46:56,976 --> 02:46:59,476
Good.

1774
02:47:06,119 --> 02:47:08,781
There's a car waiting for you
outside to take you to the airport.

1775
02:47:10,223 --> 02:47:12,723
I'll call your wife,
tell her what flight you're on.

1776
02:47:18,331 --> 02:47:20,831
- Please, can I...
- Get out of my sight.

1777
02:47:46,292 --> 02:47:48,792
Hello, Carlo.

1778
02:48:45,318 --> 02:48:48,116
Will you stop crying?
What are you trying to tell me?

1779
02:48:48,221 --> 02:48:51,019
- I'm trying to tell you you're wrong.
- Mama, please!

1780
02:48:59,434 --> 02:49:01,434
Michael! Michael!

1781
02:49:01,935 --> 02:49:04,435
Where is he?

1782
02:49:06,339 --> 02:49:11,367
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband!

1783
02:49:11,477 --> 02:49:14,071
You waited until Papa died
so nobody could stop you...

1784
02:49:14,180 --> 02:49:15,714
and then you killed him!

1785
02:49:15,715 --> 02:49:18,843
You blamed him for Sonny.
You always did. Everybody did.

1786
02:49:18,952 --> 02:49:22,581
But you never thought about me!
You never gave a damn about me!

1787
02:49:22,689 --> 02:49:25,189
Now what am I gonna do?

1788
02:49:28,895 --> 02:49:31,395
Why do you think
he kept Carlo at the mall?

1789
02:49:31,464 --> 02:49:34,024
All the time he knew
he was gonna kill him.

1790
02:49:34,133 --> 02:49:37,227
And you stood godfather
to our baby.

1791
02:49:37,337 --> 02:49:39,671
You lousy, coldhearted bastard.

1792
02:49:39,672 --> 02:49:42,172
Want to know how many men
he had killed with Carlo?

1793
02:49:42,208 --> 02:49:43,976
Read the papers!
Read the papers!

1794
02:49:43,977 --> 02:49:46,477
That's your husband!
That's your husband!

1795
02:50:00,059 --> 02:50:02,559
Take her upstairs.

1796
02:50:02,595 --> 02:50:05,095
- Get her a doctor.
- Oh, God!

1797
02:50:25,151 --> 02:50:27,651
She's hysterical.

1798
02:50:31,591 --> 02:50:34,091
Hysterical.

1799
02:50:35,094 --> 02:50:37,594
Michael, is it true?

1800
02:50:39,032 --> 02:50:41,099
Don't ask me about my business, Kay.

1801
02:50:41,100 --> 02:50:44,592
- Is it true?
- Don't ask me about my business.

1802
02:50:44,704 --> 02:50:47,204
- No.
- Enough!

1803
02:51:05,591 --> 02:51:08,091
All right.

1804
02:51:09,896 --> 02:51:12,396
This one time.

1805
02:51:15,601 --> 02:51:18,101
This one time, I'll let you
ask me about my affairs.

1806
02:51:24,644 --> 02:51:27,144
Is it true?

1807
02:51:30,750 --> 02:51:33,250
Is it?

1808
02:51:33,551 --> 02:51:35,051
No.

1809
02:51:48,768 --> 02:51:51,169
I guess we both need a drink, huh?

1810
02:51:51,170 --> 02:51:53,670
Come on.

1811
02:52:23,236 --> 02:52:25,736
Don Corleone.
