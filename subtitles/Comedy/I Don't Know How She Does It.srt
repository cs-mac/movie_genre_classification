1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT (2011)

2
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:19,833
Six years ago
I know Kate Reddy.

3
00:00:20,568 --> 00:00:22,182
The smartest kid I know.

4
00:00:22,182 --> 00:00:24,072
and also has a heart of gold.

5
00:00:24,504 --> 00:00:27,371
All working mothers
We feel that juggling ...

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,548
... With 50 plates at once, but Kate
you can give 10 more will, too.

7
00:00:31,987 --> 00:00:34,261
If you have to deliver a
report for work, do it.

8
00:00:34,677 --> 00:00:37,478
If you have to make a pair of fairy wings
for the school festival, he does.

9
00:00:37,564 --> 00:00:40,252
Appears Late
a relative of the husband ...

10
00:00:40,286 --> 00:00:43,449
... Can stand without mixing
Zanac vodka. That's incredible.

11
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,087
Do not know how she does

12
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:51,347
For all the mothers at some point
where you feel you do not succeed ...

13
00:00:52,705 --> 00:00:55,491
Kate ... for the moment
was three months ago.

14
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,430
This whole problem started with
a bake sale.

15
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:01,657
Did he tell you what the
great bake sale?

16
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:05,244
My God, the sale of
preschool cakes.

17
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:07,223
Had just arrived from Boston,

18
00:01:07,223 --> 00:01:10,796
but I got the reminder
Emily's school ...

19
00:01:10,796 --> 00:01:12,256
... Of the bake sale.

20
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,815
I promised Emily
do something homemade ...

21
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:19,127
... And was determined to stay
up all night to do so.

22
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:21,984
But the market did not have
baking ingredients.

23
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,813
This cake would be made at home
though it were the last to do.

24
00:01:31,036 --> 00:01:32,860
Why should I care?
First of all ...

25
00:01:33,273 --> 00:01:37,439
... The other mothers are small
mini army of Martha Stuart.

26
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:42,332
Their contributions would look perfect
and their daughters would feel proud.

27
00:01:42,332 --> 00:01:44,722
Em also wanted to feel that way.

28
00:01:45,642 --> 00:01:48,483
I tried to avoid the
News in 20 years.

29
00:01:48,779 --> 00:01:51,491
<i>Emily  friends discover
that the source of his mental problems ...</ i></i>

30
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:53,987
<i> ... are due to school sale
pastries. Where his mother ...</ i></i>

31
00:01:53,987 --> 00:01:55,833
<i> ... a shadowy presence in his life ...</ i></i>

32
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,152
<i> humiliated her in front ...
their classmates. </ i></i>

33
00:01:59,967 --> 00:02:01,967
I was not going to disappoint Emily.

34
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:08,236
Open up.

35
00:02:08,274 --> 00:02:09,968
So, so.

36
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:18,850
They do not understand. I still remember the
looks that made me in 1974 ...

37
00:02:18,993 --> 00:02:21,648
... When my mother sent me to
school bake sale ...

38
00:02:21,648 --> 00:02:24,017
... With two cans of chopped peaches.

39
00:02:34,884 --> 00:02:36,260
You did a cake.

40
00:02:37,029 --> 00:02:39,329
- Hello.
- Welcome home.

41
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:40,324
Thank you.

42
00:02:40,324 --> 00:02:43,123
I thought that perhaps the
powdered sugar would help.

43
00:02:43,443 --> 00:02:46,241
- This has no remedy.
- Really?

44
00:02:46,346 --> 00:02:47,870
Lie down.

45
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:51,444
We have cookies, we put
in the case and will be fine.

46
00:02:51,518 --> 00:02:53,349
Are you kidding?

47
00:02:53,386 --> 00:02:55,445
You know what I will do these
mothers with extreme diets ...

48
00:02:56,222 --> 00:02:59,248
... If the command with cookies
high in fat?

49
00:02:59,392 --> 00:03:01,451
That looks very good can I have some?

50
00:03:04,397 --> 00:03:05,989
Yes.

51
00:03:06,499 --> 00:03:08,364
You worry too much.

52
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:12,268
I just want Emily to feel
proud of what we take for sale.

53
00:03:12,405 --> 00:03:15,203
I do not feel that is different
the other children because his mother ...

54
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:17,243
... Traveling for business.

55
00:03:17,377 --> 00:03:19,345
I know that I tried.

56
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,413
Those are nice things.

57
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,443
- How was Phoenix?
- Good.

58
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:33,291
Airport taxi, meeting
hotel, meeting, taxi, airport.

59
00:03:35,361 --> 00:03:37,488
You must be exhausted.

60
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:40,957
Well ...

61
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:43,197
A little.

62
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,831
But not quite.

63
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:53,344
I am not of those wives who do not
wants to have sex with her husband.

64
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:56,340
I still think it is the
most beautiful man on earth.

65
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:59,508
Their adorable wrinkles.
His blue eyes.

66
00:04:01,254 --> 00:04:03,279
Smells like after a shower.

67
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:05,480
But there is only one problem.

68
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,724
A recent study reported that the
64% of women with young children ...

69
00:05:05,724 --> 00:05:07,453
... Do not sleep at night.

70
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:10,251
The researchers did not
find the explanation.

71
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:12,950
They could have asked me.

72
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:17,218
At night, I like the women of
around the world''do''list.

73
00:05:17,297 --> 00:05:20,323
Emily's birthday theme.
¿Pirates or pop star?

74
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:22,425
Things to buy: napkins,
toothpaste, chops ...

75
00:05:22,502 --> 00:05:24,590
The birthday gift for Jedda.

76
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,500
Find out if Jeddah is the child.

77
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,398
Call type of music.
Emily together with children who do not bite.

78
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:32,666
Fueling the car. Wait ...
Does not that should be on the list of Richard?

79
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,798
Who am I kidding,
Richard does not have a list.

80
00:05:34,798 --> 00:05:37,009
Plucking something, whatever.

81
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:39,217
Call the mother
Richard to say hello.

82
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,921
Or just send an email greeting.

83
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:41,927
Ben Wash teddy.

84
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:44,037
Taking birth control pills.
Make cupcakes.

85
00:05:44,037 --> 00:05:46,236
Complete summary of the fiscal year.
Hamster

86
00:05:46,236 --> 00:05:47,444
Begin the summary of the fiscal year.

87
00:05:47,444 --> 00:05:48,624
Go to the gym.

88
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,226
When to do Kegel exercises?

89
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:51,141
Bagles!

90
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:04,307
When I come home after a
trip to Ben does not mind my absence.

91
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,274
Is too small to hold a grudge.

92
00:06:07,413 --> 00:06:09,176
Hello.

93
00:06:09,515 --> 00:06:10,713
I love you.

94
00:06:10,713 --> 00:06:14,390
I love being the mother of a 2 years.
It's like being a movie star ...

95
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,001
... In a world without critics.

96
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:19,673
Unfortunately my daughter
forgives not that easy.

97
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:24,229
If I go long I reward
with a set of rejection and punishment.

98
00:06:24,497 --> 00:06:26,607
''Rejection''
I want Dad to take me to school.

99
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:28,185
''Rejection "
I want him to take a bath.

100
00:06:28,765 --> 00:06:31,501
''Punishment''
I do not like hugs.

101
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,871
A working mom
say no to bribe their children ...

102
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,385
... Can put it
lying on your resume.

103
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:44,373
Who wants to see
cartoons?

104
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:48,311
<i> I have your happy ending here. </ i></i>

105
00:06:49,422 --> 00:06:50,980
<i> Pig. </ i></i>

106
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,394
Good morning.

107
00:06:55,395 --> 00:06:58,228
We have to change the carpets.
Make an estimate of the expense.

108
00:06:58,264 --> 00:06:59,958
That beautiful morning.

109
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:02,333
You have something different, you ...

110
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:04,267
Am I not eating sugar?

111
00:07:04,303 --> 00:07:06,203
Your big meeting is today right?

112
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:07,472
I will work, definitely.

113
00:07:07,473 --> 00:07:09,464
Make a good dinner because
celebrate tonight.

114
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:14,412
Does not matter what I face
large firms with deep pockets?

115
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:19,375
If you make incredible changes in the
basement, and have bathrooms and great beds.

116
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:22,249
Not to mention a shirt without vomiting.

117
00:07:22,455 --> 00:07:25,390
It seems to be the worst time
to start my own business.

118
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:28,292
It is as if the economy would
begin to crumble.

119
00:07:28,327 --> 00:07:28,742
Richard.

120
00:07:28,742 --> 00:07:32,225
Ruin the business with money
we have under the mattress.

121
00:07:32,225 --> 00:07:35,569
Things will change because
you're very talented for it not to happen.

122
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:37,030
I hope so.

123
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,771
The salary is not very high,
but will ultimately be good for both.

124
00:07:40,945 --> 00:07:42,474
'I will give it.
- Give it to me?

125
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:44,375
'I will give it.
- Give it to me!

126
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,273
-I have to go.
- Wait.

127
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:49,313
Are you expecting a second while I
take a shower super fast?

128
00:07:49,348 --> 00:07:53,216
Where is Paula? Is late
all week, talk to her.

129
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:56,312
Richard, please do not talk to
it. But keep it happy leave.

130
00:07:57,423 --> 00:07:59,288
Would that be the worst in the world?

131
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:02,317
Frankly at this point,
would be easier if I were you.

132
00:08:03,262 --> 00:08:04,786
You know what I mean.

133
00:08:05,498 --> 00:08:07,261
He came.

134
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:09,197
Good morning little ones.

135
00:08:09,535 --> 00:08:13,232
Men and women view
child care in many different ways.

136
00:08:13,306 --> 00:08:15,000
The sea was beautiful today.

137
00:08:15,274 --> 00:08:17,504
Richard sees it as a waste of money,
a luxury we can not afford now.

138
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:20,474
and I see a person who knows
blanket which is what Ben likes.

139
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,441
Paula. 8 years in college.
Has not graduated yet.

140
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:28,245
It's good work, I love
children and Kate is a wonderful boss.

141
00:08:28,488 --> 00:08:31,286
What Kate is engaged?
I have no idea.

142
00:08:31,357 --> 00:08:32,949
Do you work in a bank?

143
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:34,852
Is cashier, no?

144
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:37,228
Mom will be late.

145
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:39,264
Do I put this in a container?

146
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,367
Did you ... a cake?

147
00:08:43,302 --> 00:08:45,234
Yes.

148
00:08:48,374 --> 00:08:51,502
¿I can say I work for
a very powerful investment firm?

149
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:55,442
and nothing scares me more than I
scold my daughter's teacher.

150
00:08:57,283 --> 00:08:59,251
When we arrived late
for the''circle time''.

151
00:08:59,285 --> 00:09:01,378
- Do you want a lot or little?
- Little.

152
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:03,949
- A lot.
- A lot.

153
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,917
Have a good day. I love you.

154
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:08,487
Goodbye.

155
00:09:10,363 --> 00:09:12,331
Will they take back, Ms. Reddy?

156
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,500
Yes, sorry.

157
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:17,332
Tomorrow will arrive on time.

158
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,359
Maybe.

159
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,208
- Good morning.
- Bake a cake?

160
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:26,268
- Are you trying to make me look bad?
- It's the store in the corner.

161
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:29,372
What about the mask? Well done.

162
00:09:29,448 --> 00:09:32,212
Throw away the envelope before ¿
that he saw the babysitter?

163
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:33,418
Well done.

164
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:35,444
This is my friend Alison,
and met.

165
00:09:35,488 --> 00:09:39,322
Single mother and I can always
count on it, especially when ...

166
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:43,222
... Made it worse
mine for the bake sale.

167
00:09:43,496 --> 00:09:45,464
That's instant gelatin.

168
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:47,465
Kate and I became
friends immediately.

169
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,652
A working mother
need solidarity.

170
00:09:49,652 --> 00:09:52,367
and we know in which category
with respect to reliability.

171
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:55,795
Right in the middle of''criminal''
and''shoplifters.''

172
00:09:58,277 --> 00:10:01,269
It's so sad, women were
fake orgasms and making cakes.

173
00:10:01,314 --> 00:10:03,904
'Now pretend cakes.
- That's a big improvement.

174
00:10:04,517 --> 00:10:06,485
Thank you. I was up all night.

175
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:09,353
Shit, there they are.

176
00:10:10,222 --> 00:10:11,323
There they were.

177
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:13,315
The creatures in captivity
more frightening.

178
00:10:13,526 --> 00:10:15,391
The Monsters

179
00:10:15,428 --> 00:10:17,259
On the right, Wendy Best.

180
00:10:17,463 --> 00:10:20,296
Bridesmaid, mother,
field trip chaperone,

181
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,359
Vice President of the PTA,
and also as head of terror ...

182
00:10:23,436 --> 00:10:27,202
Working mothers ...
with her domestic skills.

183
00:10:28,507 --> 00:10:35,092
and Janine Lopietro is a lady,
do yoga, pilates, crafmaga.

184
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:38,268
Better body than a sailor
and tougher too.

185
00:10:39,251 --> 00:10:42,815
There they are, not for centuries
I saw them. Honey you look great.

186
00:10:43,422 --> 00:10:47,358
I'm so jealous of you
that can work in heels

187
00:10:47,393 --> 00:10:50,226
and look beautiful all day and
We walk in the park.

188
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:53,670
Kate does not know how you do it.
Wendy and I always talk about that.

189
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:57,231
- A cookie?
- Sure, thank you.

190
00:10:57,503 --> 00:10:58,467
Delicious.

191
00:10:58,467 --> 00:10:59,656
Alison please.

192
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,245
Goodbye.

193
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:10,907
Goodbye.

194
00:11:14,453 --> 00:11:17,217
- That comb.
- Did you see the clothes?

195
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:19,713
When I decided to have my children ...

196
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:22,723
... Wanted to be I who brought them up

197
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:26,322
But women make
different decisions in life.

198
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,300
No judge, at least I try.

199
00:11:29,368 --> 00:11:30,960
Do not judge.

200
00:11:31,303 --> 00:11:33,203
- We speak later.
Good-bye.

201
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:35,931
Hello.

202
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:37,933
Go home.

203
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:39,970
Do not go to the street.

204
00:11:40,312 --> 00:11:41,413
Do not go to the street.

205
00:11:41,414 --> 00:11:43,279
Now of course I'll be late.

206
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:46,341
and have to run to the office
to arrive before my boss, Clark.

207
00:11:47,286 --> 00:11:48,946
- Hello Clark.
- Good morning.

208
00:11:49,221 --> 00:11:50,422
How are you?

209
00:11:50,423 --> 00:11:52,391
Allow me. Ladies first.

210
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,982
Thank you.

211
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,285
You're a little late today.
I come from a meeting.

212
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:01,458
I have 2 options. The
excuses of men.

213
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,264
A terrible traffic, a traffic light
broken, a faulty carburetor.

214
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,459
O. ..

215
00:12:08,407 --> 00:12:10,307
An appointment for a mammogram.

216
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:12,410
I think I'll take the stairs.

217
00:12:13,245 --> 00:12:14,837
It's good exercise for the heart.

218
00:12:20,352 --> 00:12:21,910
Good morning.

219
00:12:33,332 --> 00:12:34,958
- Meeting.
- Yes, right away.

220
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:41,371
Is that cereal?

221
00:12:45,411 --> 00:12:47,379
Butter muffin is dry.

222
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,447
What a relief.

223
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:52,246
Momo is a brilliant analyst.

224
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,376
It has the work ethic
a robot and warmth.

225
00:12:55,254 --> 00:12:57,381
But I do not care because
dedicates this to work.

226
00:12:58,324 --> 00:12:59,390
Kate Reddy ¿?

227
00:12:59,391 --> 00:13:00,983
It's the best manager we have.

228
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,251
He's great at his job.
It works a lot.

229
00:13:04,396 --> 00:13:06,296
People think that is rare.

230
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:08,390
She ... are seen as
their children all day.

231
00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:11,429
Even during lunch
when I should be working.

232
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:15,230
- Now we go to the meeting?
- I think so.

233
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:17,242
No time
talk about your roots.

234
00:13:18,511 --> 00:13:21,207
I learned that Clark
received information

235
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,214
of our proposal
funds in New York.

236
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:25,307
New York never gives us
chance of something big.

237
00:13:25,384 --> 00:13:27,443
Office treat
Boston as a sad child.

238
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:31,415
You're always tired and badly combed

239
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,357
and once smelled a
urinate all day but ..

240
00:13:34,493 --> 00:13:36,324
... Write the best reports.

241
00:13:36,362 --> 00:13:37,495
I hesitate to write them.

242
00:13:37,496 --> 00:13:40,465
If you choose one would be that of Bunce ...

243
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:43,400
Do not ask me, but
this type always appears.

244
00:13:46,505 --> 00:13:48,302
Speak of the devil.

245
00:13:48,374 --> 00:13:49,474
Kate.

246
00:13:49,475 --> 00:13:53,710
This is Chris Bunce. Our DOA.
Idiot's designated office.

247
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,927
A Bunce loves me to have children.

248
00:13:56,282 --> 00:13:58,250
This allows you to have a
competition advantage.

249
00:13:58,284 --> 00:14:00,275
The men who get
when wearing ...

250
00:14:00,352 --> 00:14:02,286
... Customers to drink
dinners and golf outings.

251
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:03,879
You know that I speak.

252
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,390
The nudists.

253
00:14:05,391 --> 00:14:07,424
There you are.
Is everything all right this morning?

254
00:14:07,424 --> 00:14:09,099
Because I was
looking for and did not find you.

255
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,393
I hope there is
nothing happened with the children.

256
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:12,607
-I had a ...
- No questions asked.

257
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:16,234
Clark told him you were amazing
Is not it?

258
00:14:16,468 --> 00:14:19,232
Do not know how he does
with all these children.

259
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:20,338
I have two.

260
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:21,999
- It's so awesome.
-You have 4 children.

261
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:23,901
Yes, but 2 are twins.

262
00:14:27,413 --> 00:14:29,247
Bunce.

263
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:31,478
How am I supposed to work
equality of the sexes?

264
00:14:31,786 --> 00:14:34,345
They can give you good jobs,
maternity leave ...

265
00:14:34,386 --> 00:14:38,288
... But until a man programes
realize that there is no toilet paper ...

266
00:14:38,357 --> 00:14:40,222
... The project is a failure.

267
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:43,455
It bothers me when people say that
there is a double standard. Men ...

268
00:14:43,495 --> 00:14:46,362
... Also have a lot to
worry about. For example shoes.

269
00:14:46,398 --> 00:14:49,390
Are there women's shoes
to shine every day? No.

270
00:14:50,302 --> 00:14:52,270
You never see a woman
shoes shined.

271
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:55,307
Women's shoes may be flat
and boring but those of men.

272
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:57,206
That's a double standard.

273
00:14:57,443 --> 00:14:59,411
Bunce had a series of
meetings this week with ...

274
00:14:59,478 --> 00:15:01,983
Investors ...
Oakland that visited us.

275
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:04,281
Yes, the meetings were marvels.

276
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,318
To learn something
culture during their stay.

277
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:07,978
I took them to a dance.

278
00:15:10,322 --> 00:15:12,222
A dance performed.

279
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,221
Excellent work, Bunce.

280
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:17,362
Let's talk business. Jack Abelhammer
our new boss in New York ...

281
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:20,263
... Saw a proposal to this office
and would like to meet with the author.

282
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,393
It's an idea worth
worthwhile to present.

283
00:15:24,403 --> 00:15:26,337
Bunce ...

284
00:15:26,338 --> 00:15:28,465
... Know how you waited
this opportunity.

285
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,868
Still waiting.

286
00:15:33,312 --> 00:15:35,371
Congratulations Kate,
go to New York tonight.

287
00:15:35,414 --> 00:15:37,314
You have a meeting to
9:00 am with Abelhammer.

288
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:39,517
Really?

289
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:42,351
I guess someone finally
read one of your proposals.

290
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:43,980
Go!

291
00:15:44,256 --> 00:15:45,780
Congratulations.

292
00:15:51,363 --> 00:15:53,490
If things are this
will be a great opportunity.

293
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:56,257
Many trips, many
Abelhammer meetings.

294
00:15:56,335 --> 00:15:57,468
It would be great.

295
00:15:57,469 --> 00:15:59,437
In addition to the times your child to spend

296
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:01,473
that while both have
expected ... with your nanny.

297
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:04,409
and your wife will be
happy, congratulations.

298
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:10,414
She is married.

299
00:16:10,482 --> 00:16:12,906
In your marriage is
to call your husband ...

300
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:15,218
... Whenever working late ...

301
00:16:15,218 --> 00:16:17,964
... Or travel the country or can not
pick up children from school.

302
00:16:18,357 --> 00:16:20,257
It is as if
on probation.

303
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:22,506
and so neither will I marry
or have children.

304
00:16:23,204 --> 00:16:24,110
I once had a fish.

305
00:16:24,906 --> 00:16:27,535
But he was looking at me with his eyes.
Saying''feed me.''

306
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:31,301
So I threw it down the toilet.
His name was Derek.

307
00:16:32,404 --> 00:16:34,393
Derek Chen.

308
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:39,376
Leave work early
and go to a bar.

309
00:16:39,411 --> 00:16:42,244
Let's pretend that we are
single and rest.

310
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:44,408
Either
things or perhaps both.

311
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:48,511
Confirming our meeting
morning at 9:00 am.

312
00:16:49,254 --> 00:16:51,279
I look forward to meeting you. Jack Abelhammer.

313
00:16:55,327 --> 00:16:59,354
I would love to but I can not, I have to go
New York and performing oral sex to another.

314
00:17:05,337 --> 00:17:09,205
Dear Jack. We also look forward
know it. Kate is ready.

315
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,280
Richard this is a great opportunity.

316
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:22,252
He had to choose
over others.

317
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,390
The chances of
that happen are very slim.

318
00:17:27,292 --> 00:17:31,285
But with the quality of your ideas
Of course, achieving this.

319
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:34,424
Good luck in your meeting
and do not worry about me.

320
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:38,266
It's a short trip, no one will notice
I turn to go. I promise.

321
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:42,235
No. You just returned.

322
00:17:42,307 --> 00:17:45,401
Honey I know, but it is only a
night and the phone with me.

323
00:17:45,477 --> 00:17:48,344
- Call me anytime.
- Whatever you say mom.

324
00:17:55,354 --> 00:17:57,254
At least you do not hate me.

325
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:11,403
Do you take Ben to get a haircut?

326
00:18:11,437 --> 00:18:14,372
Yes, I had bangs for the eyes as well
I took him to the corner barbershop.

327
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,868
It looks ...

328
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:22,236
It's lovely, thank you ...

329
00:18:22,448 --> 00:18:24,507
It was his first cut so ...

330
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:28,351
I wanted to call but not
want to disturb the work.

331
00:18:29,254 --> 00:18:30,982
No, it's ...

332
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,290
Never bothered me.

333
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:35,350
Nothing is more important
for me than boys.

334
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:38,294
I always like to hear any
big or small thing, really.

335
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:40,465
Got it.

336
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:42,297
Thank you.

337
00:18:44,236 --> 00:18:45,336
I love you.

338
00:18:45,337 --> 00:18:47,271
Good-bye mom.
Good-bye baby.

339
00:18:47,372 --> 00:18:50,466
I love you. Paula call me for what
it is. Regardless of the reason.

340
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,477
Goodbye.

341
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:54,343
Goodbye.

342
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:57,381
Goodbye.

343
00:18:57,382 --> 00:18:59,349
Goodbye.

344
00:19:05,324 --> 00:19:08,452
The manual says that children outgrow
separation anxiety at age 2.

345
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:12,293
- Good afternoon.
- That was weird.

346
00:19:13,432 --> 00:19:16,230
But that does not work for mothers.

347
00:19:16,301 --> 00:19:18,428
I missed the first
Ben haircut ...

348
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:29,474
Em had no ties
violets in your size but ...

349
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:32,245
Keep looking I promise ... right?

350
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:34,214
Okay, honey.

351
00:19:35,454 --> 00:19:36,978
You want a brush?

352
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:39,017
I am a little anxious
Is that a crime?

353
00:19:39,424 --> 00:19:40,458
Hello.

354
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:43,326
Today is the day of the games in the park.
Confirm it with Alan's nanny.

355
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:45,463
Can you wait?

356
00:19:45,464 --> 00:19:47,227
Wait yes?

357
00:19:47,332 --> 00:19:49,266
I think I have the number.
Wait.

358
00:19:52,437 --> 00:19:54,234
Bear with it for a moment.

359
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,899
Sorry.

360
00:19:58,443 --> 00:19:59,967
Would you mind?

361
00:20:03,248 --> 00:20:04,840
Why is wet?

362
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:15,953
Yes.

363
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:17,989
I have it.

364
00:20:18,363 --> 00:20:19,955
Are you there?

365
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:22,927
-Go ahead say it.
- What?

366
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:24,927
Drop it.

367
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,233
No, I ...

368
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,241
- Do not know how the hell do you do?
'You will, too. Someday.

369
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:32,476
No, no.

370
00:20:32,477 --> 00:20:34,445
- Do not have children.
- Really?

371
00:20:35,247 --> 00:20:36,314
Why not?

372
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:37,975
- To begin with ...
- You hold it for a moment?

373
00:20:38,483 --> 00:20:40,212
Momo ...

374
00:20:40,285 --> 00:20:42,480
I promise to be a mother
is one of the experiences

375
00:20:43,322 --> 00:20:45,347
more enriching
a woman can have.

376
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:48,391
Maybe it's stress.

377
00:20:50,262 --> 00:20:51,489
Sorry.

378
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:56,267
Thank you.

379
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:57,401
Take my bag.

380
00:20:57,402 --> 00:20:59,393
Sorry, my children
love this music.

381
00:21:00,372 --> 00:21:03,341
Alison I am about to enter
to a meeting do you call later?

382
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:07,377
Sure. But because I sent a
mail telling me that longed to see me?

383
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,972
What?

384
00:21:10,215 --> 00:21:13,378
Last night when I invited you to the bar I found
your answer made no sense so ...

385
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:17,447
No, I sent an e-
differently about ...

386
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:22,324
Oh my god, wait!

387
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:26,288
Do not you send an email
talking about oral sex?

388
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:29,424
-At least yesterday.
- Oh my god!

389
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:31,332
Are we ready?

390
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:34,931
Jack Abelhammer.

391
00:21:35,307 --> 00:21:37,275
Hon Momo is an honor to meet you, Mr.

392
00:21:38,477 --> 00:21:40,468
- Are we?
- Yes.

393
00:21:41,246 --> 00:21:42,513
Hear Jack ...

394
00:21:42,514 --> 00:21:45,244
Jack, about e
I sent you yesterday ...

395
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:48,385
The activity that I mentioned ...

396
00:21:49,254 --> 00:21:50,321
That's not ...

397
00:21:50,322 --> 00:21:51,948
Ah yes, I saw.

398
00:21:52,224 --> 00:21:54,385
Are you still planning to start the
meeting with that plan of action?

399
00:21:55,494 --> 00:21:57,257
Sorry ...

400
00:21:57,296 --> 00:21:59,321
... Has been cut by
budget lately ...

401
00:21:59,464 --> 00:22:01,329
So ... no.

402
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:02,500
That disappointment.

403
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:04,401
Sorry, put this thing in silence.

404
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,304
almost.

405
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,798
Sorry.

406
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:13,207
''Emily was sent back
home because they have lice.

407
00:22:13,245 --> 00:22:15,213
The whole family needs to be revised.''

408
00:22:16,515 --> 00:22:18,346
Are you all right?

409
00:22:20,252 --> 00:22:22,241
Yes.

410
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:25,523
Oh my God.

411
00:22:25,524 --> 00:22:29,255
We received many proposals
but I was intrigued by the notion of

412
00:22:29,294 --> 00:22:32,286
individual investors
with limited funds.

413
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:37,325
For that work must be
actions having a high dividend.

414
00:22:38,303 --> 00:22:41,238
But you also have to
avoid value traps.

415
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,242
I put several companies where it really
I see a multiplication of the dividend.

416
00:22:50,415 --> 00:22:52,382
I see.

417
00:22:56,421 --> 00:22:59,390
Hardcourt hates retirement business

418
00:22:59,424 --> 00:23:01,289
What can we do to convince them ...?

419
00:23:01,326 --> 00:23:03,294
- Is that a bouncy house?
- What?

420
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:07,321
What you have written in the hand
not seen him since he was 10 years.

421
00:23:09,334 --> 00:23:12,360
A house is jumping
like a tent inflatable

422
00:23:12,437 --> 00:23:14,405
where children come and jump.

423
00:23:17,442 --> 00:23:19,433
It is the birthday of my
daughter next week.

424
00:23:21,446 --> 00:23:23,311
- How many children do you have?
- 6.

425
00:23:23,382 --> 00:23:24,482
- 2!
- 2

426
00:23:24,483 --> 00:23:27,281
'You 2.
- They feel like 6.

427
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:39,192
The proposal is very ambitious.
Hardcourt just want to see the business potential.

428
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:41,490
The only thing that matters is
increased profits.

429
00:23:42,234 --> 00:23:44,361
I know it's ambitious but ...

430
00:23:45,404 --> 00:23:48,339
If it works, runs great.

431
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:52,504
Think of a retirement fund
enables people to

432
00:23:53,245 --> 00:23:56,271
contribute to social service
so they can retire really.

433
00:23:57,249 --> 00:24:00,218
That would mean a lot to
people of this country

434
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:02,277
they dread the future.

435
00:24:03,288 --> 00:24:05,279
I got involved because I saw investment

436
00:24:05,323 --> 00:24:08,224
My father wasted
each check was paid.

437
00:24:08,293 --> 00:24:10,454
I wish we had kept
money in a fund like this.

438
00:24:11,263 --> 00:24:13,288
He would have left something to my mother.

439
00:24:13,331 --> 00:24:16,323
Instead of having two jobs, 0 savings

440
00:24:16,368 --> 00:24:18,393
and a very angry dog ??named Claude.

441
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,341
What is it? I think I
metiste something in your mouth.

442
00:24:25,277 --> 00:24:26,444
I have lice.

443
00:24:26,445 --> 00:24:28,242
- Do you ...?
- Lice.

444
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:30,438
Oh my God. I did not see
Time to get out of there.

445
00:24:31,283 --> 00:24:33,478
I kept imagining tiny insects

446
00:24:34,252 --> 00:24:36,345
out of my head
and entering your email.

447
00:24:37,389 --> 00:24:39,289
Oh my god, I'm going to vomit.

448
00:24:40,258 --> 00:24:41,392
Oh no.

449
00:24:41,393 --> 00:24:43,327
Richard Wait.

450
00:24:44,229 --> 00:24:46,220
- I'll be with you soon.
- Do not put the phone here.

451
00:24:47,232 --> 00:24:49,291
- Hello Richard. What's up?
- I got it.

452
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:52,299
Enough for me basement renovation.

453
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,235
Oh my god!

454
00:24:54,372 --> 00:24:57,500
It's the best news in the world.
Honey I'm very proud of you.

455
00:24:58,343 --> 00:25:00,311
We come home to celebrate.

456
00:25:00,378 --> 00:25:02,369
Come home soon. Goodbye.

457
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,808
Yes.

458
00:25:08,286 --> 00:25:09,946
This could be a disaster.

459
00:25:11,456 --> 00:25:14,391
Clear that many children grab lice.

460
00:25:14,493 --> 00:25:16,393
But only dirty.

461
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:19,259
The moms who do not properly wash your hair
because they have no time.

462
00:25:19,397 --> 00:25:22,405
and above have a
lavándoselos teenager.

463
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:26,270
Come on, many children grab lice
in schools, no big deal.

464
00:25:26,404 --> 00:25:28,429
Yes, there were rumors that ...

465
00:25:29,307 --> 00:25:30,865
... Kate had lice.

466
00:25:31,243 --> 00:25:33,268
and the world of finance is known
you can not ignore the rumors.

467
00:25:33,445 --> 00:25:35,413
So ... spray my office.

468
00:25:36,515 --> 00:25:41,214
Then I threw everything in the
children who were in the kitchen.

469
00:25:41,486 --> 00:25:45,320
and I will ride in a
elevator or in a taxi with Kate.

470
00:25:47,325 --> 00:25:49,350
''Killers''Nits.

471
00:25:57,435 --> 00:26:00,302
If you get this,
you have to accept is incredible.

472
00:26:00,438 --> 00:26:04,306
How I can? Richard expected to work
especially now that he has a big project.

473
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:06,398
and I am very ...

474
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:09,275
... And I have enough trouble
make things work.

475
00:26:09,347 --> 00:26:12,282
Never happen. Abelhammer
clearly thought I was crazy.

476
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,341
I sent an email about oral sex ...

477
00:26:14,486 --> 00:26:18,088
... had a bouncy house painted in hand,
I scratched like a dog.

478
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:20,357
Hello.

479
00:26:20,358 --> 00:26:21,916
Hey, Clark.

480
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,257
I'm in ...

481
00:26:25,263 --> 00:26:26,497
I am at a breakfast.

482
00:26:26,498 --> 00:26:28,193
Are you all ...?

483
00:26:28,466 --> 00:26:30,334
All right.

484
00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:31,502
Yes, I'll be there.

485
00:26:31,503 --> 00:26:33,337
All right.

486
00:26:33,338 --> 00:26:35,270
Goodbye.

487
00:26:36,341 --> 00:26:38,275
Abelhammer talk to me.

488
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:43,310
The call is ready,
Mr. Abelhammer just wait.

489
00:26:43,381 --> 00:26:45,313
Thank you.

490
00:27:03,435 --> 00:27:05,402
For God's sake.

491
00:27:06,304 --> 00:27:07,896
How did this happen?

492
00:27:09,274 --> 00:27:10,798
God!

493
00:27:11,276 --> 00:27:12,443
How long you been there?

494
00:27:12,444 --> 00:27:15,436
Enough, but still, if there
something else you need ... to adjust.

495
00:27:16,214 --> 00:27:17,281
No, no.

496
00:27:17,282 --> 00:27:19,250
I think I'm too tight.

497
00:27:19,384 --> 00:27:21,318
Thank you.

498
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:23,480
Thank you for coming here today.

499
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:25,949
Of course.

500
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:27,917
I liked the proposal.

501
00:27:28,326 --> 00:27:31,318
It has some holes, but I think
we can fix it and maybe make money.

502
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,289
However. The date of
delivery will be adjusted.

503
00:27:34,366 --> 00:27:38,302
Hardcourt is looking at other possibilities
to make a decision by the end of the year.

504
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,429
This is a massive undertaking.

505
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:43,464
Mean a lot
travel, work nights,

506
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:47,205
want to make sure
not be much for you.

507
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:49,404
Considering your 6 children and lice.

508
00:27:49,447 --> 00:27:51,210
God!

509
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,318
- How do you know?
- I saw your message.

510
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:56,283
I can read upside down.

511
00:27:58,356 --> 00:28:00,345
So ...

512
00:28:00,392 --> 00:28:01,984
What do you think Kate?

513
00:28:02,394 --> 00:28:03,952
Do you agree?

514
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:07,421
This may be the best
happened to my career.

515
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:10,426
But the worst moment to happen.

516
00:28:10,502 --> 00:28:13,232
Children spend much
time with your nanny.

517
00:28:13,371 --> 00:28:16,272
Love your work more than
anyone I know.

518
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:18,332
Travel a lot, many
Abelhammer meetings.

519
00:28:18,443 --> 00:28:21,241
He knew exactly what to say.

520
00:28:21,413 --> 00:28:23,210
Sure I can.

521
00:28:24,482 --> 00:28:27,315
¿Hold the elevator?

522
00:28:27,485 --> 00:28:29,282
Thank you.

523
00:28:30,321 --> 00:28:32,414
Sorry, am I
daughter turns 6 years y. ..

524
00:28:33,224 --> 00:28:35,317
... Feared that there was no tomorrow balloons.

525
00:28:37,462 --> 00:28:39,396
Can you pull the
lobby button for me?

526
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:42,957
Did they get all?

527
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,439
Everyone knows the right way
make a birthday party.

528
00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:52,409
Ernesto Llamas Playtime Events.
He takes care of everything.

529
00:28:52,444 --> 00:28:56,244
Invitations, balloons, perfect,
and if you give $ 50 extra ...

530
00:28:56,314 --> 00:29:00,053
... Sent to the family of your husband
to the wrong address ...

531
00:29:00,053 --> 00:29:02,410
... in order to spend the day
whole driving around town ...

532
00:29:02,454 --> 00:29:04,354
... And appear at the end of the party.

533
00:29:05,356 --> 00:29:07,324
- Hi honey.
- Mom, Dad passed.

534
00:29:07,492 --> 00:29:09,289
Hi Kate.

535
00:29:10,261 --> 00:29:11,955
Hello.

536
00:29:12,363 --> 00:29:14,228
Thanks for coming.

537
00:29:14,265 --> 00:29:15,959
- A pleasure.
- Very nice.

538
00:29:16,234 --> 00:29:17,401
Good to see you.

539
00:29:17,402 --> 00:29:20,303
That's lovely, thank you.
Do you bring something to drink?

540
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:21,929
Oh no!

541
00:29:27,445 --> 00:29:29,310
Or candy.

542
00:29:30,248 --> 00:29:33,308
- Are soft drinks to children?
- No sodas have a lot of sugar.

543
00:29:33,384 --> 00:29:35,477
Yes, and dried fruit
rots their teeth.

544
00:29:36,321 --> 00:29:39,313
Last year, the nursing
school made a strike against the raisins.

545
00:29:39,524 --> 00:29:41,492
What still had a piñata?

546
00:29:42,227 --> 00:29:43,887
That's different is ...

547
00:29:45,363 --> 00:29:47,228
... Cultural enrichment.

548
00:29:47,532 --> 00:29:49,432
Here is water.

549
00:29:50,717 --> 00:29:53,329
- Think we're ridiculous.
- Because we are a little bit.

550
00:29:54,372 --> 00:29:56,272
Are you okay?
Today you are a little off.

551
00:29:56,307 --> 00:29:58,298
I? I'm fine
Why?

552
00:30:00,378 --> 00:30:02,346
Came the wild.

553
00:30:02,447 --> 00:30:04,210
I'll open the door.

554
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,318
Richard, wait, we need to talk.

555
00:30:07,485 --> 00:30:09,316
- Now?
- Dad arrived.

556
00:30:09,454 --> 00:30:11,285
Okay, then.

557
00:30:13,258 --> 00:30:14,391
What is it, Kate?

558
00:30:14,392 --> 00:30:15,984
It's just ... one thing.

559
00:30:16,394 --> 00:30:18,453
It's nothing serious
talk later.

560
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,355
- You sure?
- Yes, yes. Open the door.

561
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:25,368
I'm sorry but you New york
liked my idea of ??retirement fund.

562
00:30:25,503 --> 00:30:28,472
and want to develop it more. It
which means you have to travel

563
00:30:29,274 --> 00:30:31,242
many the next 2 months.

564
00:30:34,345 --> 00:30:36,245
Is that cake is made
organic flour?

565
00:30:36,314 --> 00:30:37,314
Yes.

566
00:30:37,315 --> 00:30:39,249
You have to change a diaper.

567
00:30:39,484 --> 00:30:43,215
I have to. We
to talk about that stuff later.

568
00:30:43,388 --> 00:30:45,219
Yes. I can not wait.

569
00:30:48,226 --> 00:30:49,852
Is it fun?

570
00:30:50,261 --> 00:30:52,252
He really is amazing with Em right?

571
00:30:53,431 --> 00:30:56,457
When my children were small I do not think
Lou has changed a single diaper.

572
00:30:58,236 --> 00:31:00,227
The men did not make those
things in those days.

573
00:31:00,405 --> 00:31:02,396
- That's because ...
- We were terrible parents.

574
00:31:03,274 --> 00:31:04,934
Neither knew it was tofu.

575
00:31:05,276 --> 00:31:08,473
But they were simpler times.
Everyone knew their place.

576
00:31:09,314 --> 00:31:11,373
Lou earned money and
I changed diapers.

577
00:31:12,217 --> 00:31:13,979
If we could not pay the
Lou was the fault of accounts.

578
00:31:14,352 --> 00:31:16,445
If the children were crying was my fault.

579
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:21,292
But you ... if something
goes wrong is the fault of all.

580
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,327
Do not think that anyone will do well.

581
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:28,297
I think now is more complicated.

582
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:31,335
I do not think hard
is the right word.

583
00:31:32,403 --> 00:31:34,303
You know, I was wondering?

584
00:31:34,372 --> 00:31:37,239
If you stay at home
Ben and speak?

585
00:31:38,243 --> 00:31:41,269
Almost 2 years have
says not a real word.

586
00:31:42,347 --> 00:31:43,973
Does not that worry you?

587
00:31:47,318 --> 00:31:50,253
and the worst is that she
is right. Ben does not speak.

588
00:31:50,321 --> 00:31:53,222
Emily recited at that age
The first chapter

589
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:55,283
Tales of
Canterbury in Old English.

590
00:31:55,326 --> 00:31:56,986
and the only thing Ben does is grunt.

591
00:31:57,262 --> 00:31:59,423
Kate is right, we have
mention the fact that you ...

592
00:31:59,464 --> 00:32:02,297
I know Richard is a
terrible time for both

593
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:05,302
to achieve two major
projects work together.

594
00:32:05,336 --> 00:32:07,327
But we can make it work, I know.

595
00:32:07,372 --> 00:32:11,206
and I will do my effort to
sure not to overlook anything.

596
00:32:15,213 --> 00:32:18,239
You worked hard to have a
opportunity at work, and me too.

597
00:32:19,284 --> 00:32:20,876
It's a big problem.

598
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:24,186
We can do this, just
have to juggle.

599
00:32:24,255 --> 00:32:25,322
I know, but if ...

600
00:32:25,323 --> 00:32:27,348
I promise I will do everything
work, do not worry.

601
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:30,361
- Okay, but only tell you ...
- I said do not worry!

602
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:33,261
These screaming.

603
00:32:46,411 --> 00:32:48,276
What is it that you do?

604
00:32:50,348 --> 00:32:52,475
Are you about to ruin
our lives and want

605
00:32:53,251 --> 00:32:55,344
use sex to
pretend that nothing happens?

606
00:32:56,454 --> 00:32:58,285
- Yes.
- I like it.

607
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,986
I love it.

608
00:33:06,297 --> 00:33:08,356
Frankly uses sex
to compensate for failures

609
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:10,458
in your relationship is the most
low that it may fall.

610
00:33:11,235 --> 00:33:12,895
But sometimes you have to do it.

611
00:33:13,404 --> 00:33:15,235
I do all the time.

612
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,205
One cup of 100% success.

613
00:33:18,443 --> 00:33:21,344
Richard was right
worry would be very challenging.

614
00:33:21,412 --> 00:33:24,313
Thank god Momo had to
help with the workload.

615
00:33:24,382 --> 00:33:28,284
Friendly, very supportive, friendly.
It was none of those things

616
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:30,287
but was killed at work.

617
00:33:31,456 --> 00:33:34,357
My job was to spend 2 or 3
days a week with Jack.

618
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:39,429
It was impressive, it was insightful,
intelligently. It was many things

619
00:33:39,464 --> 00:33:42,456
and none of them was a Chris Bunce.

620
00:33:42,533 --> 00:33:45,400
I think we should include a
request of insurance funds.

621
00:33:46,304 --> 00:33:47,930
Exactly.

622
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:53,444
Jack I mean ...

623
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:55,376
If you go back to thank me again ...

624
00:33:55,413 --> 00:33:57,278
... Please do not.

625
00:33:58,249 --> 00:33:59,416
No.

626
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:00,941
It would not do it.

627
00:34:02,453 --> 00:34:05,479
Not someone who would appreciate
gave me a great opportunity.

628
00:34:06,224 --> 00:34:08,249
Perhaps the greatest
opportunity of my career.

629
00:34:08,326 --> 00:34:10,191
What kind of person would it be?

630
00:34:10,395 --> 00:34:12,295
All right. Precisely.

631
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,828
But thanks.

632
00:34:31,382 --> 00:34:34,374
- This is what you will.
- If you are good.

633
00:34:34,485 --> 00:34:36,248
I go to the bathroom.

634
00:34:47,498 --> 00:34:50,262
I regret not being there to give
a goodnight kiss but ...

635
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:51,927
See you tomorrow right?

636
00:34:55,406 --> 00:35:00,241
I love you. A kiss on the face.
and a hug on the neck.

637
00:35:01,512 --> 00:35:04,242
A hug in the neck.

638
00:35:04,282 --> 00:35:05,976
and barrel to fire ...

639
00:35:06,517 --> 00:35:09,418
and without speaking in dreams.

640
00:35:20,465 --> 00:35:24,492
For the section of returns, I
Thinking about making a chart showing ...

641
00:35:26,437 --> 00:35:28,234
Enough talk.

642
00:35:29,373 --> 00:35:31,238
Do I get my martini?

643
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:33,368
Continue by removing the edge of the table.

644
00:35:33,511 --> 00:35:35,274
Sorry.

645
00:35:35,446 --> 00:35:38,347
I'm surprised you do not
is cutting the steak.

646
00:35:39,383 --> 00:35:41,476
- Is the force of habit.
- All right.

647
00:35:42,453 --> 00:35:44,353
Do you have children?

648
00:35:46,457 --> 00:35:48,424
No.

649
00:35:49,393 --> 00:35:50,951
If ...

650
00:35:52,497 --> 00:35:54,397
... I was married. Once.

651
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:58,266
A very sweet girl. Very special.

652
00:35:58,436 --> 00:36:00,233
and then ...

653
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:04,308
two years after we
married y. .. got sick

654
00:36:06,277 --> 00:36:08,336
although he fought a lot ...

655
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:15,419
- I'm sorry.
- All right.

656
00:36:16,354 --> 00:36:17,878
I am well.

657
00:36:19,257 --> 00:36:22,317
When something's wrong
in life will change it ...

658
00:36:24,262 --> 00:36:26,230
... And change the way you see everything.

659
00:36:26,464 --> 00:36:29,297
Since then I try to keep
things as simple as I can.

660
00:36:30,301 --> 00:36:31,927
I love my job.

661
00:36:32,436 --> 00:36:34,427
It has its ups and downs but
least not breaks your heart.

662
00:36:35,506 --> 00:36:37,474
What about you? Do you like what you do?

663
00:36:38,442 --> 00:36:40,376
I love my job.

664
00:36:41,279 --> 00:36:44,248
The marking does not know my gender, it only
care if I'm right or not.

665
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:47,317
and I like how fair is that.

666
00:36:47,485 --> 00:36:51,353
Although sometimes I wish not to love
So my job because then ...

667
00:36:51,422 --> 00:36:53,481
... Could be home with your children.

668
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:56,326
You are allowed to miss your children.

669
00:36:58,229 --> 00:37:01,255
I have 2 beautiful children and love them.

670
00:37:02,433 --> 00:37:05,368
But life changes,
That is unquestionable.

671
00:37:05,503 --> 00:37:09,269
you can not share with friends,
or entertainment,

672
00:37:10,241 --> 00:37:12,300
or see a movie when you want.

673
00:37:13,277 --> 00:37:15,336
- Or go bowling.
- Play bowling?

674
00:37:15,413 --> 00:37:18,382
Yes, my sister and I used to play bowling
forever but now both are mothers ...

675
00:37:19,517 --> 00:37:21,451
Where's the time?

676
00:37:22,353 --> 00:37:24,013
We play bowling?

677
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,948
Sorry.

678
00:37:28,226 --> 00:37:30,421
I should not have told you so
about my children. It's unprofessional.

679
00:37:31,395 --> 00:37:35,388
From now on do not think
Kate me as working mothers.

680
00:37:35,466 --> 00:37:37,400
But like Bill.

681
00:37:38,302 --> 00:37:40,270
Your trusted financial analyst.

682
00:37:41,372 --> 00:37:44,341
But studies show that the
Women are better investors ...

683
00:37:44,442 --> 00:37:46,433
... But if you forget
you're a woman.

684
00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:53,383
Thank you.

685
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:57,308
Well ...

686
00:37:58,256 --> 00:38:00,349
- Good evening, Jack.
- Good night, Bill.

687
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,359
Goodbye.

688
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:17,206
Goodbye.

689
00:38:20,344 --> 00:38:23,245
From that moment
life became more complicated.

690
00:38:24,448 --> 00:38:28,214
The funny thing was that it seemed to me
striving to make things work.

691
00:38:29,453 --> 00:38:32,320
I once read that the important
in juggling is not catching

692
00:38:32,423 --> 00:38:36,416
but throw. so I kept throwing.

693
00:38:37,495 --> 00:38:39,395
and throwing.

694
00:38:39,463 --> 00:38:41,488
This is new. It has spots.

695
00:38:42,433 --> 00:38:44,458
My God, I have something to wear!

696
00:38:56,414 --> 00:38:59,406
- How 'Ben and vomiting?
- Do not want to eat.

697
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:03,352
Emily had never seen work so hard,
but it has always been there for Ben and Emily.

698
00:39:03,421 --> 00:39:05,412
She really loves those kids.

699
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:21,361
I leave my children in the
school at 7:15 am.

700
00:39:21,472 --> 00:39:23,440
Such as' I arrive here at 7:45?

701
00:39:24,241 --> 00:39:25,867
More or less.

702
00:39:26,377 --> 00:39:28,345
I'm like the ...

703
00:39:30,314 --> 00:39:32,281
... 2:00 pm.

704
00:39:37,254 --> 00:39:38,982
I know you want to go. Can not
give the newspaper right?

705
00:39:39,256 --> 00:39:40,390
Of course not.

706
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:42,359
I know how to give
means to you. Kill you.

707
00:39:42,426 --> 00:39:44,360
You keep saying that.

708
00:39:44,395 --> 00:39:46,260
I am a man journalist.

709
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,423
So I quit. I need to go
somewhere where it can be a woman.

710
00:39:50,401 --> 00:39:53,302
Suddenly it was as if our
lives were in fast.

711
00:39:53,504 --> 00:39:56,302
I had to pay attention
all at the same time.

712
00:39:57,274 --> 00:39:59,263
Beware!

713
00:39:59,343 --> 00:40:02,312
The other basic rule of
Juggling is that what goes up

714
00:40:04,482 --> 00:40:06,279
must come down.

715
00:40:11,322 --> 00:40:13,381
Beware of dog poop, baby.

716
00:40:14,358 --> 00:40:18,260
At the same time Jack and I had
delivery date soon.

717
00:40:18,295 --> 00:40:20,388
So our post office and no
were daily but at all times.

718
00:40:20,464 --> 00:40:24,298
But I promise you tried
maintain professional distance.

719
00:40:26,437 --> 00:40:29,338
Dear Jack, here is the
final version of Power Point.

720
00:40:30,408 --> 00:40:32,376
Do you have a desire?

721
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:42,351
We will add the finishing touches
late to bed.

722
00:40:45,356 --> 00:40:47,415
You know I bow forward.

723
00:40:51,462 --> 00:40:53,327
See you soon. Kate.

724
00:41:06,343 --> 00:41:07,901
Why are you still awake?

725
00:41:08,379 --> 00:41:11,371
-Working.
- We are well enough.

726
00:41:11,415 --> 00:41:13,178
Go to bed.

727
00:41:13,284 --> 00:41:15,275
I have much to do. The
bed is a waste of time.

728
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:19,381
I hope not forever.
Good night, Kate.

729
00:41:20,357 --> 00:41:22,257
Kisses, Jack.

730
00:41:22,426 --> 00:41:24,394
Good night. Besos.

731
00:41:30,301 --> 00:41:31,927
Good night, Kate.

732
00:41:33,404 --> 00:41:34,471
No.

733
00:41:34,472 --> 00:41:37,407
If firms with''kisses''best
writes''please''penétrame.

734
00:41:43,314 --> 00:41:45,008
- Hello.
- Hello Dad.

735
00:41:46,484 --> 00:41:49,317
Remember that Paula has
to leave at 5. Can you ...?

736
00:41:49,386 --> 00:41:51,479
I have the meeting at 4:00
pm and then I have dinner.

737
00:41:52,223 --> 00:41:53,951
Yes, I forgot.

738
00:41:54,425 --> 00:41:57,258
- Do you think maybe you can?
- Yes, no problem, I will.

739
00:41:57,294 --> 00:41:59,319
-I love you, I have to go.
-I love you too, bye.

740
00:41:59,396 --> 00:42:01,387
- Where the hell is Paula?
- I do not know.

741
00:42:01,432 --> 00:42:03,400
I will bring to the school.

742
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,470
Goodbye Daddy.

743
00:42:07,471 --> 00:42:09,339
Goodbye.

744
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,331
Look Emily ¿
your lunch?

745
00:42:13,444 --> 00:42:15,344
This week we had
excellent meetings.

746
00:42:15,412 --> 00:42:17,312
Business Quarter
the destination is good.

747
00:42:17,348 --> 00:42:19,407
Okay, let's make money.

748
00:42:21,252 --> 00:42:23,311
- Bunce want to eat steak?
- You know I do.

749
00:42:23,387 --> 00:42:25,287
I would be honored if you would let me pay.

750
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:30,385
Tomorrow I'll be late.
I have an appointment with the doctor.

751
00:42:30,494 --> 00:42:32,257
All right.

752
00:42:33,364 --> 00:42:35,264
Because I'm pregnant.

753
00:42:36,233 --> 00:42:37,400
What about you?

754
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:38,501
I know.

755
00:42:38,502 --> 00:42:40,436
Some birth control failure.

756
00:42:42,273 --> 00:42:45,242
Do not worry'll take care of
it. I will not have children. Do you remember?

757
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:47,307
Wait.

758
00:42:49,246 --> 00:42:52,061
I know I look Momo
and see a disaster.

759
00:42:53,049 --> 00:42:57,507
Always in a hurry, without plucking eyebrows,
walking out of control ...

760
00:42:57,507 --> 00:42:58,713
I understand.

761
00:42:59,323 --> 00:43:01,223
But it's not just that.

762
00:43:01,292 --> 00:43:03,226
There is so much joy.

763
00:43:04,361 --> 00:43:09,321
and if for some reason you want
go through the craziness of having a baby

764
00:43:10,301 --> 00:43:13,236
I can help. I've been
doing for a while.

765
00:43:13,337 --> 00:43:17,205
I could show you useful tips
you can manage the home and work.

766
00:43:17,408 --> 00:43:19,239
To either side are ...

767
00:43:19,276 --> 00:43:21,004
Oh my god! What time is it?

768
00:43:22,246 --> 00:43:23,906
Shit!

769
00:43:24,214 --> 00:43:25,481
Shit!

770
00:43:25,482 --> 00:43:28,349
Shit!

771
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,389
Shit.

772
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:36,359
Richard I am. Sorry
much, much, much love.

773
00:43:36,393 --> 00:43:39,328
I know you have a dinner.
I'm on track so you can go.

774
00:43:40,331 --> 00:43:44,233
I'm on the stairs, about to enter
the revolving door, I'm into it.

775
00:43:45,336 --> 00:43:48,650
A woman keeps the puzzle
family in his head.

776
00:43:49,473 --> 00:43:54,046
The interior of a working woman is
as the control tower of an airport.

777
00:43:54,511 --> 00:43:56,274
Richard, dear.

778
00:43:56,313 --> 00:43:57,480
I came.

779
00:43:57,481 --> 00:43:59,382
I'm home.

780
00:43:59,383 --> 00:44:01,374
- Mami.
- Where is Daddy?

781
00:44:02,219 --> 00:44:03,419
He had to go to dinner.

782
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,285
So who are you with?

783
00:44:11,495 --> 00:44:13,395
Sorry, I did not know what to do.

784
00:44:13,464 --> 00:44:15,227
Yes, I know but ...

785
00:44:15,299 --> 00:44:18,291
I called and asked Wendy
If your nanny could come.

786
00:44:19,303 --> 00:44:21,498
''Did you call Wendy I
everything perfect''Best?

787
00:44:22,473 --> 00:44:25,340
And then let my kids
I know someone who does not?

788
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:27,400
Kate, you were not here,
I left with a babysitter.

789
00:44:27,444 --> 00:44:29,309
Not known.

790
00:44:29,346 --> 00:44:31,439
It was okay. Sometimes it
must be sufficient.

791
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:35,352
The children are well and that this
Once the old nanny was perfect.

792
00:44:36,353 --> 00:44:38,412
Get a babysitter
support is on my list.

793
00:44:38,455 --> 00:44:40,423
How the list again, seriously?

794
00:44:40,491 --> 00:44:45,292
Doing Pilates, baking lasagna, perhaps
want to include conquering space.

795
00:44:45,462 --> 00:44:48,488
That's not very nice of you.
I do many things such list.

796
00:44:49,233 --> 00:44:51,326
Sorry, honey, go to sleep right?

797
00:44:52,302 --> 00:44:56,329
Richard Wait, tomorrow I have
go to Cleveland. Just for one night.

798
00:44:57,241 --> 00:45:01,268
Jack and I have to see about
investors and how much they want to see

799
00:45:01,345 --> 00:45:04,337
before presenting the
Hardcourt final proposal.

800
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:11,220
Come on.

801
00:45:11,221 --> 00:45:12,745
Go to sleep.

802
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,019
I'm still here.

803
00:45:18,395 --> 00:45:20,488
In this work we have to travel.
We road warrior.

804
00:45:21,265 --> 00:45:23,426
and if you are tied to something ...

805
00:45:25,235 --> 00:45:27,362
... Then you are a
bird can not fly.

806
00:45:28,338 --> 00:45:32,274
and no one goes to a store
and ask for a pet bird can not fly.

807
00:45:54,364 --> 00:45:55,531
Thank you.

808
00:45:55,532 --> 00:45:58,296
I think this will convince
Hardcourt to commit.

809
00:46:00,437 --> 00:46:04,430
How big was the
where did this come from potatoes?

810
00:46:05,375 --> 00:46:08,367
This is the kind of thing the
that a family would laugh.

811
00:46:12,382 --> 00:46:13,906
Sorry.

812
00:46:16,286 --> 00:46:18,254
- Did you like investors?
- I loved it.

813
00:46:19,389 --> 00:46:22,358
Are we going to visit some of the
Attractions in Cleveland?

814
00:46:22,392 --> 00:46:24,223
Repíteme what they were.

815
00:46:24,294 --> 00:46:26,353
Want to know what the
joke business travel?

816
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:30,332
My mother always says,''must be
exciting to see all these cities.''

817
00:46:31,301 --> 00:46:34,236
But mostly what we see are the
inside of hotels and airports.

818
00:46:35,405 --> 00:46:36,929
Not tonight.

819
00:46:42,513 --> 00:46:45,243
- Do you play bowling?
- Is that it?

820
00:46:46,283 --> 00:46:48,444
They have everything you need, but
have to wait half an hour

821
00:46:49,253 --> 00:46:51,015
by a line because it is
our championship night.

822
00:46:51,321 --> 00:46:53,380
Unless you want to play
with some of the groups.

823
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,293
May be a little competitive.

824
00:47:07,404 --> 00:47:09,269
Yes, very good!

825
00:47:10,307 --> 00:47:12,366
You know small but throw!

826
00:47:14,411 --> 00:47:15,969
Watch and learn.

827
00:47:23,287 --> 00:47:25,221
They all go down.

828
00:47:25,355 --> 00:47:26,947
Timbo!

829
00:47:28,258 --> 00:47:29,492
You will die.

830
00:47:29,493 --> 00:47:31,393
We do not defraud, New York.

831
00:47:33,497 --> 00:47:37,297
Quite simply, you rock
and aim right in the middle.

832
00:47:37,501 --> 00:47:39,469
Just throw and pray.

833
00:47:41,371 --> 00:47:43,362
I have it.

834
00:47:45,342 --> 00:47:47,002
Good luck New York.

835
00:47:57,487 --> 00:47:59,284
Yes!

836
00:47:59,356 --> 00:48:01,324
Now you are those who fall.

837
00:48:02,326 --> 00:48:04,317
I understand what you mean.
Bowling is fun.

838
00:48:06,263 --> 00:48:07,889
Health all.

839
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:14,930
Very cute.

840
00:48:21,445 --> 00:48:24,471
If you win this for us. You
Sorry to be a banker.

841
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:35,458
Yes!

842
00:48:39,263 --> 00:48:40,991
Thank you.

843
00:48:42,299 --> 00:48:44,233
Yes!

844
00:48:56,413 --> 00:48:59,211
I can not believe you're a
classic bowler.

845
00:49:01,385 --> 00:49:04,377
When I went to college
here my friends played bowling

846
00:49:06,323 --> 00:49:08,257
and I enjoyed it.

847
00:49:09,326 --> 00:49:11,226
But not so tonight.

848
00:49:17,234 --> 00:49:18,467
What then?

849
00:49:18,468 --> 00:49:22,370
Then I went to my hotel room,
I ate all the candy and fell asleep.

850
00:49:24,274 --> 00:49:26,435
But then he appeared at your door
Kate and I said I can not live without you ...

851
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:28,444
- ... Run away with me.
- No.

852
00:49:29,413 --> 00:49:31,404
- Not so.
- Really?

853
00:49:32,282 --> 00:49:34,216
Did you tell Richard
Jack your output?

854
00:49:34,284 --> 00:49:36,252
No, because we go out,
we went bowling.

855
00:49:36,453 --> 00:49:38,318
This is absurd.

856
00:49:39,289 --> 00:49:41,348
Jack and I are just friendly.

857
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:43,459
You're right.

858
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,519
I know you sexy men
not support flirting

859
00:49:46,263 --> 00:49:48,231
with his sexy co-workers.

860
00:49:48,298 --> 00:49:49,958
He's not that scary.

861
00:49:50,267 --> 00:49:51,893
How does your email signature?

862
00:49:52,336 --> 00:49:53,402
What?

863
00:49:53,403 --> 00:49:57,271
With:''Jack'',''greetings''
''Yours'',''thinking of you.''

864
00:49:58,241 --> 00:49:59,799
I do not know.

865
00:50:00,243 --> 00:50:01,344
Is it with kisses''''?

866
00:50:01,345 --> 00:50:02,478
It is with''kisses''right?

867
00:50:02,479 --> 00:50:05,312
Stop examined not
I am one of your cases.

868
00:50:05,515 --> 00:50:07,483
'I blush.
- Of course not.

869
00:50:08,251 --> 00:50:09,911
Kate promise ...

870
00:50:10,487 --> 00:50:12,478
will not do anything disgusting or immoral.

871
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:15,014
But tell me everything.

872
00:50:16,393 --> 00:50:18,384
Finishing out the microwave.

873
00:50:19,363 --> 00:50:21,263
Come on, be cool.

874
00:50:21,331 --> 00:50:23,265
Wait.

875
00:50:23,266 --> 00:50:24,400
How was your trip?

876
00:50:24,401 --> 00:50:26,368
What?

877
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:28,504
You went to Cleveland.

878
00:50:28,505 --> 00:50:30,268
It was good.

879
00:50:31,274 --> 00:50:34,437
The good news is that the project
is in good shape. Jack is happy.

880
00:50:35,412 --> 00:50:36,479
Jack is happy.

881
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,243
Jack likes to send messages.

882
00:50:38,415 --> 00:50:40,212
Jack you went crazy.

883
00:50:42,285 --> 00:50:43,979
I searched on Google. Sit down.

884
00:50:45,389 --> 00:50:47,357
It's horrible.

885
00:50:48,258 --> 00:50:50,249
You must be a nightmare
walking with that man.

886
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,351
Really? I had not noticed.

887
00:50:52,396 --> 00:50:54,261
You had not set.

888
00:50:54,331 --> 00:50:56,356
- Not if it was cute or not.
- No, of course not.

889
00:50:57,467 --> 00:50:59,367
So ... is happy.

890
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:04,238
This means that we can go home
your parents for Thanksgiving.

891
00:51:04,508 --> 00:51:07,375
and then we can make a fire
shaped Christmas tree.

892
00:51:07,411 --> 00:51:09,470
and I was thinking maybe ...

893
00:51:11,314 --> 00:51:12,974
... We could find a new nanny.

894
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,276
Yes. We could look for a new
babysitter and maybe going to the movies.

895
00:51:18,321 --> 00:51:20,289
- Yes. It would be fun.
- Yes.

896
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:23,391
It will be a perfect trip and fun.

897
00:51:25,328 --> 00:51:27,260
I like it.

898
00:51:29,266 --> 00:51:31,496
Last night I woke up and realized
we group the tables

899
00:51:32,235 --> 00:51:34,328
for dividends
are grouped by type.

900
00:51:34,404 --> 00:51:37,305
- We may revise this tomorrow.
- I can send it by mail.

901
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:40,275
I will not be in the office until Monday.

902
00:51:40,343 --> 00:51:42,277
Really? But you said
wanted to do many things.

903
00:51:42,345 --> 00:51:44,279
It's Thanksgiving.
Okay, we're fine.

904
00:51:45,315 --> 00:51:47,249
- You sure?
- Yes.

905
00:51:48,285 --> 00:51:50,276
and want to spend time with my family.

906
00:51:52,322 --> 00:51:53,982
- One more thing.
- Yes?

907
00:51:56,293 --> 00:51:57,851
I have the baby.

908
00:52:00,263 --> 00:52:01,330
What?

909
00:52:01,331 --> 00:52:05,267
I decided to be superior only because
I only want the best for me.

910
00:52:05,302 --> 00:52:07,327
My God, momo, forget this!

911
00:52:11,341 --> 00:52:12,475
I feel uncomfortable.

912
00:52:12,476 --> 00:52:14,410
I am very happy for you.

913
00:52:15,512 --> 00:52:17,207
I'm still uncomfortable.

914
00:52:18,415 --> 00:52:21,441
There is no way that someone
can explain it is to have a baby

915
00:52:21,518 --> 00:52:23,418
and once you have it

916
00:52:23,487 --> 00:52:26,285
you wonder why anyone
never told you how she felt.

917
00:52:26,456 --> 00:52:28,287
Please just hold me.

918
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:30,985
Happy Thanksgiving.

919
00:52:31,328 --> 00:52:32,886
Same to you.

920
00:52:33,463 --> 00:52:36,227
Being pregnant does not feel great.

921
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,268
It feels like a mistake.

922
00:52:39,269 --> 00:52:41,328
But many women
have babies by mistake.

923
00:52:42,372 --> 00:52:44,397
Maybe my baby will be like Justin Bieber.

924
00:52:45,408 --> 00:52:47,239
He was wrong at first.

925
00:52:47,277 --> 00:52:48,835
Now a billionaire.

926
00:52:49,479 --> 00:52:51,344
- Good night.
- Good evening, Kate.

927
00:52:52,349 --> 00:52:55,250
There you are. I heard that
you will take 5 days off.

928
00:52:58,288 --> 00:53:00,313
But you know I'll be in the city.

929
00:53:00,357 --> 00:53:02,325
We'll dinner to 20 people.

930
00:53:02,392 --> 00:53:03,984
3 we roast turkeys.

931
00:53:04,494 --> 00:53:06,462
If you need to cover you'll be here.

932
00:53:09,232 --> 00:53:11,325
¿3 bucks? That is incredible.

933
00:53:11,401 --> 00:53:14,427
Why not give my number to Abelhammer
if you need anything?

934
00:53:15,472 --> 00:53:17,201
Happy Thanksgiving.

935
00:53:19,409 --> 00:53:21,377
This is what they have
Bunce to know about.

936
00:53:21,411 --> 00:53:25,245
It's those guys what they like
appear at the end and take credit

937
00:53:25,348 --> 00:53:27,475
After another person
has done the hard work.

938
00:53:28,251 --> 00:53:30,446
If I slip him a little
this super ready to pounce.

939
00:53:35,258 --> 00:53:37,351
By the way, I
a spectacular turkey.

940
00:53:37,427 --> 00:53:39,190
It's delicious.

941
00:53:39,262 --> 00:53:41,321
Everyone says that my
breasts are very juicy.

942
00:53:45,368 --> 00:53:46,468
My God.

943
00:53:46,469 --> 00:53:48,437
You look like a mule of the
climbing the Sierra Madre.

944
00:53:49,306 --> 00:53:52,332
I have diapers. The chair
laptop, a portable crib.

945
00:53:53,276 --> 00:53:56,245
Pacifiers, pots
grain of children.

946
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,443
You do not have to pack. All
buy the things they know doubles.

947
00:54:00,483 --> 00:54:02,451
Leave a lump in the
cottage and ready.

948
00:54:04,387 --> 00:54:06,514
Children travel more
lighter than us.

949
00:54:07,424 --> 00:54:09,221
Ready for fun?

950
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,249
I like the spirit.

951
00:54:13,463 --> 00:54:17,194
Do not tell your mother about my new
project and I have to deliver soon.

952
00:54:17,267 --> 00:54:18,961
What do you do, lie?

953
00:54:19,502 --> 00:54:21,299
Let's see ... other.

954
00:54:25,308 --> 00:54:26,442
She will not stay inside.

955
00:54:26,443 --> 00:54:28,206
1, 2, 3.

956
00:54:29,346 --> 00:54:30,870
Do not worry about that.

957
00:54:31,514 --> 00:54:33,311
That is our right?

958
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:35,339
Oh no.

959
00:54:35,352 --> 00:54:36,944
Who knows the lyrics?

960
00:54:37,254 --> 00:54:38,354
Daddy sings.

961
00:54:38,355 --> 00:54:40,289
Come on.

962
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:41,814
I love this part.

963
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,227
Sing, Kate.

964
00:54:46,396 --> 00:54:48,227
Emily, come on.

965
00:54:52,269 --> 00:54:53,929
Yes, Kate sings.

966
00:54:56,373 --> 00:54:57,897
What do we do?

967
00:55:00,377 --> 00:55:02,242
-Here we go.
- 1, 2 ...

968
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:09,418
Look at this, we travel.

969
00:55:10,253 --> 00:55:11,947
All together in one place.

970
00:55:12,322 --> 00:55:13,422
Right?

971
00:55:13,423 --> 00:55:15,288
You're right, this is great.

972
00:55:15,492 --> 00:55:17,460
- It's nice.
- Seriously.

973
00:55:21,298 --> 00:55:22,822
These vibrating.

974
00:55:23,366 --> 00:55:25,231
You can answer, okay.

975
00:55:25,468 --> 00:55:27,369
I a. ..

976
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:29,235
Put it in silence y. ..

977
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,238
already silent. and not worry.

978
00:55:34,377 --> 00:55:35,511
No. ..

979
00:55:35,512 --> 00:55:37,412
Will not work, see?

980
00:55:39,282 --> 00:55:40,449
I do not need.

981
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:41,517
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

982
00:55:41,518 --> 00:55:43,452
- You take the calls.
- I do not need.

983
00:55:44,421 --> 00:55:46,252
All right.

984
00:55:51,227 --> 00:55:52,887
That was a mistake.

985
00:55:53,463 --> 00:55:55,363
Who wants some of me?

986
00:55:55,398 --> 00:55:57,229
Here we go.

987
00:55:57,267 --> 00:55:59,234
Naked.

988
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,004
That smells delicious.

989
00:56:12,349 --> 00:56:13,873
Thank you.

990
00:56:15,485 --> 00:56:17,248
Thanks for doing this.

991
00:56:17,454 --> 00:56:19,354
It smells delicious, Kate.

992
00:56:23,426 --> 00:56:26,293
A lot of dolls
snow stand ...

993
00:56:26,363 --> 00:56:29,457
Frete to stand on
a barber shop and you say ...

994
00:56:30,233 --> 00:56:31,927
Smells like carrots.

995
00:56:33,303 --> 00:56:34,963
It's the same joke last year.

996
00:56:35,238 --> 00:56:36,864
You ruined my joke.

997
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,367
30 years ago
accounts the same joke.

998
00:56:41,277 --> 00:56:42,311
I do not understand.

999
00:56:42,312 --> 00:56:44,371
For their noses, because they are carrots.

1000
00:56:45,315 --> 00:56:49,251
The road must be covered with snow
so if anyone wants to go skiing.

1001
00:56:49,285 --> 00:56:51,378
I promised Emily that morning
would make a snowman right?

1002
00:56:51,454 --> 00:56:52,488
Yes.

1003
00:56:52,489 --> 00:56:54,320
We can do it later.

1004
00:56:54,357 --> 00:56:56,382
This is delicious mom
What did you do this year?

1005
00:56:56,459 --> 00:56:59,360
I ran out of pumpkins
canned and I had to ...

1006
00:56:59,396 --> 00:57:03,332
- Did you use light cream?
- Yes, but the fat is better.

1007
00:57:04,334 --> 00:57:06,268
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1008
00:57:06,336 --> 00:57:07,469
Yes, it's here.

1009
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:10,268
- Kate is for you, someone named Nono.
- Momo.

1010
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,932
Answer in the other room.

1011
00:57:13,376 --> 00:57:15,241
What do you mean, momo?

1012
00:57:17,247 --> 00:57:19,238
- Are you okay?
- What is your problem?

1013
00:57:19,315 --> 00:57:21,340
You leave an amount of messages,
Jack tries to locate you.

1014
00:57:21,384 --> 00:57:22,518
'll Check my phone.

1015
00:57:22,519 --> 00:57:25,352
Do you remember Barry
Bradwood? He was arrested.

1016
00:57:26,256 --> 00:57:27,489
- He is in prison.
- Really?

1017
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:29,424
Bradwood Barry ¿? What did?

1018
00:57:30,427 --> 00:57:33,362
He got into something with a some
with a drug trafficker.

1019
00:57:33,396 --> 00:57:35,421
I heard even killed someone.

1020
00:57:39,369 --> 00:57:41,360
- Who killed him?
- I do not know.

1021
00:57:42,405 --> 00:57:46,239
Hello Jack, I regret not having answered your
flames, my cell reception is ...

1022
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:48,243
What?

1023
00:57:48,278 --> 00:57:51,270
Sorry, Kate, Hardcourt changed
the time of the presentation.

1024
00:57:51,347 --> 00:57:52,973
You can only see us tomorrow.

1025
00:57:53,249 --> 00:57:54,977
Damn does that when it happened?

1026
00:57:55,251 --> 00:57:57,344
If you can not come perhaps Bunce can go.

1027
00:57:58,421 --> 00:58:01,219
Hardcourt has to go
Hong Kong after tomorrow.

1028
00:58:04,427 --> 00:58:08,261
Which means that tomorrow
tomorrow is our only chance

1029
00:58:08,431 --> 00:58:10,422
to present this thing.

1030
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,365
But Jack Bunce said he would.

1031
00:58:12,502 --> 00:58:14,236
Let it go.

1032
00:58:14,237 --> 00:58:15,404
Come on, Richard.

1033
00:58:15,405 --> 00:58:18,238
I can not let stay Bunce
with this you know how much I have tried.

1034
00:58:19,275 --> 00:58:22,301
I can not control or as
or where he was introduced.

1035
00:58:22,412 --> 00:58:26,348
It's not my fault. Plan to all
so that the same is not happening.

1036
00:58:30,253 --> 00:58:32,278
But we would make a snowman.

1037
00:58:32,355 --> 00:58:33,947
Honey I know.

1038
00:58:35,492 --> 00:58:38,222
The next time there is snow

1039
00:58:38,328 --> 00:58:40,319
we will make a doll
it snows, I promise.

1040
00:58:41,431 --> 00:58:43,262
as you promised.

1041
00:58:49,272 --> 00:58:50,405
Goodbye, Ben.

1042
00:58:50,406 --> 00:58:52,237
Goodbye mom.

1043
00:58:52,475 --> 00:58:54,238
Oh my god!

1044
00:58:56,312 --> 00:58:57,836
He spoke.

1045
00:58:58,414 --> 00:59:00,382
Oh Ben!

1046
00:59:00,383 --> 00:59:02,283
Mom said goodbye.

1047
00:59:02,352 --> 00:59:03,910
Goodbye mom.

1048
00:59:04,387 --> 00:59:06,218
That can be useful.

1049
00:59:08,424 --> 00:59:10,324
- Richard ...
-You have to go, Kate.

1050
00:59:11,461 --> 00:59:13,429
Discuss this when you come back right?

1051
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,438
Goodbye.

1052
00:59:31,481 --> 00:59:34,416
All we heard the
Thanksgiving night.

1053
00:59:34,484 --> 00:59:37,385
Leave after dinner.
Really? Who does that?

1054
00:59:38,421 --> 00:59:40,286
I'd rather be with my family.

1055
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:43,359
Clean as my husband
and his friends watch football.

1056
00:59:44,494 --> 00:59:47,292
Chasing after children
because they ate a lot of cake.

1057
00:59:48,231 --> 00:59:50,495
Then make 11 appetizers
leftovers for the next day.

1058
00:59:51,467 --> 00:59:55,335
While my mother complains
my filling was too dry.

1059
00:59:56,506 --> 00:59:59,339
First time I hear
someone complain about my fill.

1060
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:02,307
Just ...

1061
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:05,514
It's family.

1062
01:00:05,515 --> 01:00:07,382
and love it.

1063
01:00:07,383 --> 01:00:08,941
I love it.

1064
01:00:09,352 --> 01:00:11,411
I feel much better,
continue with the proposal.

1065
01:00:12,322 --> 01:00:16,349
Maybe we can start with an overview of the
dividends compared with no dividends.

1066
01:00:19,362 --> 01:00:20,954
Care.

1067
01:00:21,431 --> 01:00:23,422
Or you can throw a few more times.

1068
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:29,361
- Momo okay?
- Yes.

1069
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,374
This does not feel like a miracle.

1070
01:00:33,242 --> 01:00:35,301
The morning sickness only last as ...

1071
01:00:36,312 --> 01:00:37,870
9 months.

1072
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:41,874
I have experience.

1073
01:00:45,388 --> 01:00:47,288
- Are you okay?
- Do not I look good?

1074
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:48,914
Let's walk.

1075
01:00:49,492 --> 01:00:51,289
Momo.

1076
01:00:54,263 --> 01:00:55,855
Oh my God.

1077
01:00:56,432 --> 01:00:58,400
It's official, I'm disgusting.

1078
01:00:59,502 --> 01:01:01,299
How did this happen?

1079
01:01:01,371 --> 01:01:03,338
Do not answer.

1080
01:01:08,311 --> 01:01:10,243
Thank you.

1081
01:01:10,313 --> 01:01:12,213
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1082
01:01:12,415 --> 01:01:14,474
Thank you for your sweet note
and beautiful room.

1083
01:01:15,351 --> 01:01:16,451
You know what?

1084
01:01:16,452 --> 01:01:18,317
I killed working to achieve this.

1085
01:01:18,521 --> 01:01:21,388
You deserve a nice room or if
we have a chance to Hardcourt

1086
01:01:22,258 --> 01:01:23,492
will be by the way ...

1087
01:01:23,493 --> 01:01:25,393
are ready to
Mr. Abelhammer you.

1088
01:01:25,461 --> 01:01:27,229
Come on.

1089
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:28,992
Remember. We are a great team, Bill.

1090
01:01:34,303 --> 01:01:37,238
We are here today to
discuss possibilities.

1091
01:01:38,307 --> 01:01:40,366
The possibility of having
a new financial product.

1092
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:44,302
That can restore some faith
our customers have lost.

1093
01:01:44,447 --> 01:01:48,315
We want to show that we understand
we want them to have money

1094
01:01:48,384 --> 01:01:50,318
we.

1095
01:01:50,453 --> 01:01:53,286
So I would like to start
with some tables showing

1096
01:01:53,389 --> 01:01:55,380
Dividend strategy design.

1097
01:02:01,364 --> 01:02:03,331
Momo.

1098
01:02:06,402 --> 01:02:09,371
The presentation went very well.

1099
01:02:10,339 --> 01:02:12,204
No one would realize that Momo and I ...

1100
01:02:12,241 --> 01:02:13,935
Were awake ...
all night rehearsing.

1101
01:02:14,343 --> 01:02:16,241
Until ...

1102
01:02:16,412 --> 01:02:18,004
It's a boy!

1103
01:02:19,415 --> 01:02:22,384
Last year I made 300 presentation
and never began to miss any.

1104
01:02:23,286 --> 01:02:25,254
Not my fault, the
pregnancy affected my brain.

1105
01:02:25,455 --> 01:02:27,480
I do not get the baby
is far from the brain.

1106
01:02:28,391 --> 01:02:30,222
What else can you do to your brain?

1107
01:02:37,366 --> 01:02:39,272
Sorry, I was so nervous
I forgot all part of ...

1108
01:02:39,272 --> 01:02:43,205
Are you kidding? That was a home run.
I did not say a word, he loved it.

1109
01:02:43,272 --> 01:02:44,473
Really?

1110
01:02:44,474 --> 01:02:46,374
You did everything perfect.

1111
01:02:46,476 --> 01:02:48,273
God, I love ...

1112
01:02:48,444 --> 01:02:50,771
... The way in which
did everything. It was brilliant.

1113
01:02:51,314 --> 01:02:52,872
Here let me close it is.

1114
01:02:56,419 --> 01:02:58,351
Are you okay?

1115
01:03:04,393 --> 01:03:06,258
I hope Kate does not have ruined it.

1116
01:03:06,362 --> 01:03:08,227
No, okay, do not worry.

1117
01:03:19,242 --> 01:03:22,370
Just as I thought the future is great.
Imagine what we will do in Boston.

1118
01:03:23,246 --> 01:03:25,305
It will take me to lunch
have many questions.

1119
01:03:25,448 --> 01:03:28,440
Seem to be indicated, which
mean you can not be serious.

1120
01:03:30,253 --> 01:03:31,845
Should I ...?

1121
01:03:32,421 --> 01:03:34,252
Does it return to Boston?

1122
01:03:34,423 --> 01:03:36,448
Yeah, I think. I call
if I find something right?

1123
01:03:39,262 --> 01:03:40,495
Do you know that was the first thing he said?

1124
01:03:40,496 --> 01:03:42,430
Where did I get this idea?

1125
01:03:48,404 --> 01:03:50,463
I hope you say that you took.

1126
01:03:52,308 --> 01:03:53,934
We developed it together.

1127
01:03:54,243 --> 01:03:56,234
A lot has changed since the
version with which I began.

1128
01:03:56,512 --> 01:03:58,275
It is not correct.

1129
01:03:58,414 --> 01:04:00,211
You should be at lunch.

1130
01:04:00,316 --> 01:04:02,284
- Hardcourt should know you.
- I know.

1131
01:04:02,385 --> 01:04:05,377
I already know. I was the
who made the presentation.

1132
01:04:06,522 --> 01:04:10,253
But now Jack will be the luncheon
Hardcourt and make sure that for dessert

1133
01:04:10,326 --> 01:04:12,351
this idea is all of Jack.

1134
01:04:12,461 --> 01:04:15,362
These guys are not giving rise to the top
credit to the team with which they work.

1135
01:04:18,367 --> 01:04:19,925
What am I doing?

1136
01:04:20,503 --> 01:04:22,334
You have to come with me.

1137
01:04:22,438 --> 01:04:24,429
You are where I got this idea.

1138
01:04:25,241 --> 01:04:26,308
It's yours.

1139
01:04:26,309 --> 01:04:27,409
We are a team.

1140
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:29,207
and equipment are kept together.

1141
01:04:29,478 --> 01:04:31,467
Right, momo?

1142
01:04:33,282 --> 01:04:36,513
It is the turn 18. Or the 28? I do not remember.

1143
01:04:37,286 --> 01:04:39,345
- On 18.
- Is 18?

1144
01:04:40,323 --> 01:04:44,191
There was much tension. In fact I think all
at the bowling alley were silent.

1145
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:46,428
and this gentleman.

1146
01:04:48,297 --> 01:04:50,356
This elegant, from where you are.

1147
01:04:51,367 --> 01:04:55,463
He gets up and says''you
are going down.''

1148
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,205
-So.
-Just like that.

1149
01:04:59,408 --> 01:05:02,241
I think I yelled. Finally
I found my inner voice.

1150
01:05:02,345 --> 01:05:04,404
I think you said it all with an accent.

1151
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:09,350
- It was a pleasure meeting you.
- Likewise.

1152
01:05:09,452 --> 01:05:12,250
Jack will tell you that I like
say no when I have questions

1153
01:05:12,388 --> 01:05:15,221
but you did a good
demonstration and I'm intrigued.

1154
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:17,223
Thank you very much.

1155
01:05:17,326 --> 01:05:18,850
Thank you.

1156
01:05:19,328 --> 01:05:21,228
Right if you like thanks.

1157
01:05:21,497 --> 01:05:23,486
I'll be in touch.

1158
01:05:30,406 --> 01:05:33,204
That was miraculous,
never says anything positive.

1159
01:05:33,409 --> 01:05:35,274
Do you think I will buy it?

1160
01:05:35,378 --> 01:05:37,403
Yeah, I think we
a great opportunity.

1161
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:40,278
Oh my god, I can not
believe that it has done so well!

1162
01:05:40,449 --> 01:05:42,417
Do you think you get to
time for the plane?

1163
01:05:42,485 --> 01:05:44,350
I do not know, I have to see what time it is.

1164
01:05:45,354 --> 01:05:47,379
Look at that. Finally
the battery went out.

1165
01:05:47,523 --> 01:05:49,457
Yes, I loaded.

1166
01:05:50,359 --> 01:05:51,985
Use the mine.

1167
01:05:54,297 --> 01:05:55,957
A lot of missed calls.

1168
01:05:56,232 --> 01:05:57,892
All for you.

1169
01:05:59,402 --> 01:06:02,303
Richard, love will arrive
as soon as possible.

1170
01:06:08,411 --> 01:06:10,242
Monitor them closely.

1171
01:06:10,346 --> 01:06:13,440
If you experience dizziness or nausea
bring it immediately.

1172
01:06:13,482 --> 01:06:15,450
Thank you very much.

1173
01:06:15,484 --> 01:06:17,352
Emily.

1174
01:06:17,353 --> 01:06:19,320
Ben.

1175
01:06:20,289 --> 01:06:21,949
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi honey.

1176
01:06:22,325 --> 01:06:24,259
What happened?

1177
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:26,455
She stumbled and fell down the stairs.

1178
01:06:41,243 --> 01:06:44,212
A man says he will leave
the office to be with her son

1179
01:06:44,413 --> 01:06:49,248
and all look like the
paternal example to follow.

1180
01:06:49,418 --> 01:06:53,218
One woman says she will leave the
office to be with her sick child

1181
01:06:54,323 --> 01:06:59,260
and is called as disorganized
irresponsible and has no commitment.

1182
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:15,310
- I know you're on the list right?
- No, forget the list.

1183
01:07:15,378 --> 01:07:17,403
You live here do not you have stumbled
that thing plenty of times?

1184
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,345
At least he was here when it happened.

1185
01:07:19,448 --> 01:07:22,281
And I tried to call but not
answered the phone in hours.

1186
01:07:22,418 --> 01:07:24,443
I told you I forgot
charging the phone.

1187
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:28,388
So I had to enter your computer
and get the phone to your boyfriend.

1188
01:07:28,491 --> 01:07:30,391
That was a great feeling.

1189
01:07:30,459 --> 01:07:33,189
'Oh please.
-And he did not answer.

1190
01:07:33,262 --> 01:07:35,389
You also forgot to charge your batteries?
Jack does not look like I know.

1191
01:07:35,498 --> 01:07:38,228
We were at the meeting
with Hardcourt, you know.

1192
01:07:38,434 --> 01:07:41,403
We were sitting naked in
a beach in Aruba drinking corn tais.

1193
01:07:42,371 --> 01:07:44,396
That is a denial strangely vivid.

1194
01:07:44,507 --> 01:07:46,338
You're right, I failed.

1195
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:49,310
Ben was not here when I needed it.

1196
01:07:49,378 --> 01:07:50,936
What is the difference?

1197
01:07:51,247 --> 01:07:52,480
Even when these
here, not here.

1198
01:07:52,481 --> 01:07:54,244
We never sat down.

1199
01:07:54,517 --> 01:07:56,382
Never relax, we do not laugh.

1200
01:07:56,485 --> 01:07:59,386
I do not even speak of
done when we have sex.

1201
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:04,225
Honestly ...

1202
01:08:04,326 --> 01:08:06,294
I do not know what you want from me.

1203
01:08:06,429 --> 01:08:09,296
I some times do not
is in a panic.

1204
01:08:09,432 --> 01:08:11,400
To talk about something
rather than logistics.

1205
01:08:12,301 --> 01:08:15,327
To pretend to laugh at my
old jokes you've heard.

1206
01:08:16,305 --> 01:08:21,208
Where we have 5 minutes
a silent conversation.

1207
01:08:22,311 --> 01:08:24,404
Only 5 min. to be together.

1208
01:08:25,481 --> 01:08:27,210
That's it.

1209
01:08:35,257 --> 01:08:36,391
My list.

1210
01:08:36,392 --> 01:08:38,383
1: get my life back.

1211
01:08:40,262 --> 01:08:42,230
2: Stop making lists.

1212
01:08:47,236 --> 01:08:48,369
Where is Dad?

1213
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:50,201
He had to go to work early.

1214
01:08:52,241 --> 01:08:53,341
Em ...

1215
01:08:53,342 --> 01:08:56,368
You know I do not want to go
during Thanksgiving and no ...

1216
01:08:56,445 --> 01:08:59,312
You missed it. As you
Jamaica lost day.

1217
01:08:59,482 --> 01:09:01,416
and Liby birthday party.

1218
01:09:02,218 --> 01:09:05,187
Because you had to talk on the phone
and take a plane to New York.

1219
01:09:05,387 --> 01:09:07,184
I tell everyone ...

1220
01:09:07,289 --> 01:09:09,450
maybe one day we
a snowman together.

1221
01:09:10,292 --> 01:09:11,850
Or maybe not.

1222
01:09:12,228 --> 01:09:14,219
No, we will, I promise.

1223
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:15,922
Yes?

1224
01:09:16,332 --> 01:09:18,232
The next time it snows.

1225
01:09:19,268 --> 01:09:21,235
I love you.

1226
01:09:43,492 --> 01:09:45,483
At work when you
behave like a man,

1227
01:09:46,262 --> 01:09:47,990
say you're rough and tough.

1228
01:09:48,264 --> 01:09:49,497
and when you behave like a woman,

1229
01:09:49,498 --> 01:09:51,398
say you are emotional and difficult.

1230
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:55,334
So difficult is the adjective used
for everything that does not like men.

1231
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:08,216
Know that I heard
be a merger of accounts in Atlanta.

1232
01:10:09,285 --> 01:10:10,945
If so I heard.

1233
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:12,980
I need you tonight
someone to go that far.

1234
01:10:14,523 --> 01:10:16,490
Yes.

1235
01:10:22,331 --> 01:10:23,855
Hello.

1236
01:10:26,302 --> 01:10:27,962
What are you where?

1237
01:10:35,477 --> 01:10:37,445
What a pleasant surprise.

1238
01:10:38,314 --> 01:10:39,906
What are you doing here?

1239
01:10:41,317 --> 01:10:44,252
It's not just you who you are
always have to go to New York.

1240
01:10:45,287 --> 01:10:47,312
I like to do something
respect, especially now.

1241
01:10:48,357 --> 01:10:49,949
Why now?

1242
01:10:50,259 --> 01:10:51,919
The fund will need a name.

1243
01:10:52,494 --> 01:10:54,229
Wait ...

1244
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:55,330
Did we?

1245
01:10:55,331 --> 01:10:58,323
Hardcourt only fund a project
pilot. But rarely does this ...

1246
01:10:59,501 --> 01:11:01,269
We did it.

1247
01:11:01,270 --> 01:11:02,403
We did it.

1248
01:11:02,404 --> 01:11:04,269
Kate, I mean ...

1249
01:11:05,441 --> 01:11:07,272
Also came to tell you ...

1250
01:11:08,477 --> 01:11:12,208
You and I are a team. One very good.

1251
01:11:14,416 --> 01:11:16,247
Lately I've been thinking.

1252
01:11:17,386 --> 01:11:18,486
Kate ...

1253
01:11:18,487 --> 01:11:20,318
I do not usually do these things.

1254
01:11:20,422 --> 01:11:24,222
I check my mail every 10 seconds
to see if I got something of yours.

1255
01:11:25,394 --> 01:11:28,295
I want to tell all
funny things I heard in the day.

1256
01:11:28,497 --> 01:11:33,400
I know that given your circumstances
it's crazy but I have to tell you

1257
01:11:37,506 --> 01:11:41,237
if any part of
you who feel the same.

1258
01:11:43,345 --> 01:11:46,212
I told you my story
keep things simple.

1259
01:11:46,448 --> 01:11:48,416
Thou hast yet complicated.

1260
01:11:49,518 --> 01:11:53,249
and I for the first time in a long
time I feel ready to ...

1261
01:11:53,455 --> 01:11:54,979
I ...

1262
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:57,384
Jack I am delighted
you feel that way ...

1263
01:11:57,459 --> 01:12:00,189
and now find someone.

1264
01:12:00,496 --> 01:12:03,329
That means so much to
you and Richard for me.

1265
01:12:07,269 --> 01:12:11,399
I ruined a lot of things at home and
I still hope to have a home with him.

1266
01:12:12,408 --> 01:12:14,342
Because that's where I belong.

1267
01:12:18,247 --> 01:12:19,839
It's snowing.

1268
01:12:20,249 --> 01:12:21,382
Yes.

1269
01:12:21,383 --> 01:12:24,216
God! I have to go.
Sorry.

1270
01:12:24,386 --> 01:12:27,287
I'll call you then there
something I have to do.

1271
01:12:32,394 --> 01:12:33,952
Thank you.

1272
01:12:34,296 --> 01:12:36,285
Thank you.

1273
01:12:48,243 --> 01:12:49,377
I need to talk to him.

1274
01:12:49,378 --> 01:12:51,004
It is in a meeting.

1275
01:12:58,354 --> 01:13:02,415
Clark came to tell you not to
I can go to Atlanta until Monday.

1276
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:06,394
So ... be careful.

1277
01:13:06,462 --> 01:13:08,430
No. You will go this weekend.

1278
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:10,327
Customers are waiting.

1279
01:13:12,234 --> 01:13:13,501
Can we discuss this in private?

1280
01:13:13,502 --> 01:13:17,268
We can talk about on Monday when you return
your trip to Atlanta this weekend.

1281
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:20,672
All right.

1282
01:13:20,845 --> 01:13:21,870
So ...

1283
01:13:22,503 --> 01:13:24,363
Yeah, look ...
the problem is ...

1284
01:13:27,316 --> 01:13:28,908
... I ...

1285
01:13:29,418 --> 01:13:30,976
... I'm not available.

1286
01:13:31,353 --> 01:13:33,342
Why?

1287
01:13:33,422 --> 01:13:35,411
Because ...

1288
01:13:37,326 --> 01:13:38,986
... I have to make a snowman.

1289
01:13:40,396 --> 01:13:43,422
It is good but more work in the firm.

1290
01:13:45,434 --> 01:13:50,201
First, because I have two lives and I have
time to enjoy either.

1291
01:13:52,441 --> 01:13:54,409
It's snowing, mother comes to
home earlier today right?

1292
01:13:54,476 --> 01:13:57,343
No, honey, she has to
work. We will see later.

1293
01:13:57,479 --> 01:13:59,276
No, it will come.

1294
01:13:59,381 --> 01:14:00,481
Taxi.

1295
01:14:00,482 --> 01:14:05,215
Second, when you want to be
a man, a woman is wasted.

1296
01:14:05,287 --> 01:14:08,347
He said the next time it snowed
would make a snowman together.

1297
01:14:10,259 --> 01:14:12,386
Come, as promised. Twice.

1298
01:14:13,295 --> 01:14:16,321
Third, because my children will grow
in a blink of an eye

1299
01:14:16,432 --> 01:14:18,297
and I would be lost.

1300
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,233
Honey your mom misses you
much, but has to work.

1301
01:14:21,503 --> 01:14:23,403
Really, are you sure?

1302
01:14:35,317 --> 01:14:36,875
Do you want to go play?

1303
01:14:38,353 --> 01:14:44,258
Fourth, because somehow, one day

1304
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:46,428
Things have to change.

1305
01:14:47,296 --> 01:14:48,888
Richard I ...

1306
01:14:49,498 --> 01:14:52,194
I know things have
to be different.

1307
01:14:52,468 --> 01:14:55,369
I know that if you do not have this
improve things work

1308
01:14:55,471 --> 01:14:57,371
In so many ways.

1309
01:14:57,439 --> 01:14:59,407
But ...

1310
01:14:59,408 --> 01:15:01,467
But I have no job if I am not myself.

1311
01:15:02,377 --> 01:15:05,244
and I without you, without Ben and without Emily ...

1312
01:15:07,382 --> 01:15:09,371
It's nothing.

1313
01:15:09,518 --> 01:15:11,213
So ...

1314
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:13,217
Today I went to see Clark.

1315
01:15:14,289 --> 01:15:19,249
I've given all I have to
this job and love it, really.

1316
01:15:20,295 --> 01:15:23,389
But I can not keep leaving
my family at all times.

1317
01:15:24,266 --> 01:15:25,433
I will not.

1318
01:15:25,434 --> 01:15:28,198
If I have to give you not enough ...

1319
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:31,899
... Then despídeme.

1320
01:15:33,275 --> 01:15:35,243
But do not give up.

1321
01:15:35,377 --> 01:15:37,003
I will not.

1322
01:15:38,313 --> 01:15:40,247
I can not give up.

1323
01:15:43,385 --> 01:15:44,943
Then go.

1324
01:15:49,491 --> 01:15:51,391
You can go on Monday.

1325
01:15:52,494 --> 01:15:55,190
Now get out.

1326
01:15:56,331 --> 01:15:58,231
Prior to reconsider.

1327
01:15:58,333 --> 01:15:59,433
Really?

1328
01:15:59,434 --> 01:16:01,302
Salt

1329
01:16:01,303 --> 01:16:02,403
Thank you.

1330
01:16:02,404 --> 01:16:03,962
Thank you.

1331
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:08,400
Bunce, take off that smile
Smarty will face.

1332
01:16:08,477 --> 01:16:10,445
If you make a foundation
Jack Abelhammer

1333
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:13,209
talk to soften
your schedule as well.

1334
01:16:17,419 --> 01:16:23,380
So from now if someone
Clark will be disappointed, or Jack or Bunce

1335
01:16:24,393 --> 01:16:27,419
If I settle with my bosses,
then seek a new job.

1336
01:16:27,496 --> 01:16:30,260
There is always some
new deal to do.

1337
01:16:30,432 --> 01:16:33,299
But there will be only one
first haircut.

1338
01:16:33,402 --> 01:16:34,468
All right.

1339
01:16:34,469 --> 01:16:36,334
-Also, from now on ...
- Yes.

1340
01:16:36,405 --> 01:16:39,465
Cakes and I will show you with pride.

1341
01:16:41,243 --> 01:16:43,438
So, I bought the cake, yes.

1342
01:16:44,379 --> 01:16:46,210
What's wrong?

1343
01:16:47,349 --> 01:16:49,317
Richard I know you get mad but ...

1344
01:16:50,452 --> 01:16:52,010
I love you.

1345
01:16:52,421 --> 01:16:54,286
In an incredible amount.

1346
01:16:54,456 --> 01:16:56,447
and I very much regret what happened.

1347
01:16:59,428 --> 01:17:00,952
Are you done?

1348
01:17:01,396 --> 01:17:03,328
Yes.

1349
01:17:03,398 --> 01:17:05,263
Because even I have something to say.

1350
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,468
Something to read.

1351
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:12,898
A list.

1352
01:17:16,278 --> 01:17:17,478
Yes.

1353
01:17:17,479 --> 01:17:19,447
Change the carpet of the stairs.

1354
01:17:20,449 --> 01:17:22,438
I already did.

1355
01:17:22,484 --> 01:17:25,385
You have to buy a leopard
The Emily's ballet recital.

1356
01:17:25,487 --> 01:17:28,285
Speech therapy
Ben starts on Thursday.

1357
01:17:29,257 --> 01:17:30,951
Everything is ready.

1358
01:17:31,226 --> 01:17:33,194
I noted also
pillow nightmares.

1359
01:17:33,295 --> 01:17:35,456
You may never use but I scored.

1360
01:17:39,234 --> 01:17:40,860
me and Kate.

1361
01:17:41,336 --> 01:17:42,894
Yes.

1362
01:17:43,271 --> 01:17:44,863
Is the number one.

1363
01:17:45,307 --> 01:17:46,899
Richard.

1364
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:50,207
It will remain a disaster.

1365
01:17:50,412 --> 01:17:53,210
That's all I'm still safe.

1366
01:17:54,383 --> 01:17:56,283
But it is our right?

1367
01:18:02,324 --> 01:18:04,189
- Where are they?
- I do not know.

1368
01:18:04,326 --> 01:18:05,918
Encontrémoslos.

1369
01:18:09,431 --> 01:18:10,955
Hello.

1370
01:18:11,266 --> 01:18:12,926
Let's make a snowman sand.

1371
01:18:13,268 --> 01:18:16,294
In these circumstances, a final
everything is impossible to fix.

1372
01:18:19,241 --> 01:18:22,472
Kate has a new fund and all
We are very happy for her.

1373
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,443
I think of all are
is the least happy.

1374
01:18:30,419 --> 01:18:32,353
But I'm still very happy for her.

1375
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:39,418
Momo is so beautiful.

1376
01:18:41,363 --> 01:18:42,921
Also ...

1377
01:18:43,432 --> 01:18:45,263
... It is difficult to calculate.

1378
01:18:46,368 --> 01:18:48,302
As they gave me was like ...

1379
01:18:52,474 --> 01:18:54,465
Why not tell me anything about this?

1380
01:18:55,277 --> 01:18:56,971
You are selfish by not sharing.

1381
01:18:57,512 --> 01:18:59,241
It's not funny.

1382
01:19:00,282 --> 01:19:04,275
If we expand globally,
rates can have up to 2%.

1383
01:19:04,352 --> 01:19:07,412
That would make sense but
you had smeared all over her face.

1384
01:19:09,491 --> 01:19:11,258
Here?

1385
01:19:11,259 --> 01:19:12,293
Thank you.

1386
01:19:12,294 --> 01:19:14,228
Are not 100%
me want to go to Aruba?

1387
01:19:14,262 --> 01:19:15,429
Yes.

1388
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:17,455
But my friend Alison
love Aruba.

1389
01:19:17,499 --> 01:19:19,364
It's smart, she's beautiful.

1390
01:19:19,434 --> 01:19:20,501
Is available.

1391
01:19:20,502 --> 01:19:22,336
I love it.

1392
01:19:22,337 --> 01:19:23,963
How will the meeting with Victor Chao?

1393
01:19:24,406 --> 01:19:26,306
Will be in New York on Saturday.

1394
01:19:26,341 --> 01:19:28,241
He said he can see us in the morning.

1395
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:30,210
I can not, I have another appointment on Saturday.

1396
01:19:30,445 --> 01:19:32,345
1, 2, 3.

1397
01:19:42,224 --> 01:19:43,491
Mami I can take it ¿?

1398
01:19:43,492 --> 01:19:45,357
Hit the ball.

1399
01:19:46,261 --> 01:19:49,287
Back in Berlin on Tuesday
and go straight to san francisco.

1400
01:19:51,233 --> 01:19:52,466
I will go to New York next week.

1401
01:19:52,467 --> 01:19:54,367
-Tremendous schedule.
- It is.

1402
01:19:56,438 --> 01:19:59,305
I do not remember at what Kate is engaged now?

1403
01:19:59,341 --> 01:20:01,502
Is it complicated
has to do with money, right?

1404
01:20:02,244 --> 01:20:04,337
No, it's actually very simple.

1405
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:13,880
It is a juggler.

1406
01:20:28,503 --> 01:20:30,437
2 months later.

1407
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:34,431
It has an electronic card.

1408
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:40,373
Jack and Alison Greetings from Aruba.

1409
01:20:41,383 --> 01:20:44,352
Dear Kate, is a
wonderful girl, thank you.

1410
01:20:45,453 --> 01:20:47,421
Thank you, thank you.

1411
01:20:52,227 --> 01:20:54,195
It may be Irish or esconces.

1412
01:20:54,262 --> 01:20:56,321
But whatever there
beneath the kilt.

1413
01:20:56,364 --> 01:20:59,333
I assure you they do not tell Abelhammer
Abel''hammer''for nothing.
