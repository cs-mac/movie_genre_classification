00:00:06,208 --> 00:00:09,183
<i>Episode 2</i>

2
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:24,434
What are you doing?

3
00:00:24,677 --> 00:00:25,579
Me?

4
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,494
Haven't you just heard your interview was over?

5
00:00:37,807 --> 00:00:39,605
Yes, I  did hear that.

6
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:41,684
Then get out.

7
00:00:42,171 --> 00:00:43,719
Just a minute.

8
00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:46,663
I'm going to go crazy!

9
00:00:51,922 --> 00:00:53,768
Don't you hear me telling you to get out?

10
00:00:58,735 --> 00:01:00,288
What are you doing?

11
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:03,357
I lied earlier during the interview.

12
00:01:03,357 --> 00:01:06,327
Wouldn't it be possible to give me another chance?

13
00:01:06,327 --> 00:01:07,272
No.

14
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:15,631
You asked about my country earlier.

15
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:17,342
We did. And we also heard your answer.

16
00:01:17,342 --> 00:01:21,047
Country. Call its name once and my heart beats

17
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:24,560
Call its name twice and heat overcomes me.

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,878
That is how the Greek poet Nikos Kazantzakis defined his country in his poem.

19
00:01:30,146 --> 00:01:32,516
However, personally, the word 'Korean peninsula'

20
00:01:32,516 --> 00:01:36,389
has never made my heart beat or overwhelmed me with warmth.

21
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,897
At least until now, my nation has not moved me in any way.

22
00:01:41,218 --> 00:01:44,595
Instead, it only gave me disappointment and despair.

23
00:01:45,136 --> 00:01:50,864
If I am given the chance, I want to build a country that can move people.

24
00:01:50,864 --> 00:01:56,198
A country that can move people who are nothing, like myself.

25
00:01:57,943 --> 00:02:00,827
This is my truth.

26
00:02:06,955 --> 00:02:08,339
Next.

27
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:18,719
No. 2030 Gong Do-ha.

28
00:02:26,695 --> 00:02:28,073
Excuse me.

29
00:02:28,424 --> 00:02:29,486
What are you doing?

30
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,757
Me?

31
00:02:36,828 --> 00:02:37,960
Hey.

32
00:02:40,103 --> 00:02:42,188
I'm sorry. Just a second.

33
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,028
Why didn't he go home?

34
00:02:47,038 --> 00:02:49,291
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

35
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,278
What if you get caught? You'll have to pay back his car, you'll be caught as a liar!

36
00:03:12,278 --> 00:03:14,362
You and I will both be on the news.

37
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:44,880
What the...? So weird!

38
00:04:08,876 --> 00:04:10,855
This woman, Kim Seo-won, give me her contact number.

39
00:04:10,855 --> 00:04:13,656
Oh my, didn't you exchange phone numbers?

40
00:04:13,944 --> 00:04:15,752
Well, we didn't, that's why I'm asking you.

41
00:04:15,752 --> 00:04:17,153
I'm sorry, dear customer.

42
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:21,813
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't, due to the privacy protection act.

43
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,210
Did I ask you for her social security number?

44
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,578
I'm asking you for her phone number.

45
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:29,018
That is also personal information.

46
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:29,783
What about her address?

47
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:35,125
I'm sorry sir. There are sometimes people who become stalkers and stalk people to their home.

48
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:38,478
The addresses are kept confidential.

49
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:49,416
It's not like there are many diplomats in this neighborhood.

50
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:53,554
Do you think I won't find her?

51
00:04:55,793 --> 00:04:58,173
Tell this woman something very clear.

52
00:04:59,361 --> 00:05:01,591
If I catch her, she won't make it alive.

53
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,721
Go straight ahead and then turn right.

54
00:05:11,721 --> 00:05:14,545
Thank you.

55
00:05:25,688 --> 00:05:26,626
Who is it?

56
00:05:27,163 --> 00:05:28,798
This is Mr. Kim Young-chul, the ambassador's house, isn't it?

57
00:05:28,798 --> 00:05:30,180
Yes, it is.

58
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,742
Is Kim Seo-won ssi home?

59
00:05:31,742 --> 00:05:34,284
You're at the wrong house. There is no such person here.

60
00:05:34,477 --> 00:05:35,757
Isn't his daughter...?

61
00:05:35,757 --> 00:05:37,906
We only have two sons.

62
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:40,143
This is the only diplomat's house in this neighborhood.

63
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:50,491
In the writing exam for broadcasting,

64
00:05:50,491 --> 00:05:52,897
they gave out a question on K-Pop, quite exceptiionally.

65
00:05:52,897 --> 00:05:56,135
I said that this question would definitely be on the exam.

66
00:05:56,135 --> 00:05:57,351
I guessed it, and I guessed it right.

67
00:05:57,351 --> 00:06:01,554
So what? Am I showing off? Saying I'm good at guessing?

68
00:06:01,554 --> 00:06:07,388
Yes, I am. You study with me, and I guarantee you a 99% acceptance in broadcasting.

69
00:06:07,696 --> 00:06:13,557
Aside from this public lecture, I also do private tutoring.

70
00:06:13,788 --> 00:06:15,422
One to one!

71
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,504
I don't need the money. I'm not interested.

72
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:23,567
I will give you everything I have!

73
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:26,082
Do you understand? Clap of hands!

74
00:06:26,082 --> 00:06:29,213
One to one personal tutoring... Expensive

75
00:06:37,448 --> 00:06:39,742
Look at her, pretending to study.

76
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,751
Blind date. Jerk. What a grotestque taste he has.

77
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:47,416
What?

78
00:06:48,935 --> 00:06:50,522
Damn it.

79
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,918
Diplomat, you say.

80
00:06:58,573 --> 00:07:00,624
You think I can't get you?

81
00:07:08,393 --> 00:07:10,011
This is so frustrating!

82
00:07:11,153 --> 00:07:13,614
I told you not to do anything stupid.

83
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:16,896
Stop crying Mom.

84
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:19,249
What?

85
00:07:19,483 --> 00:07:23,178
Why are you talking about me finding a job all of a sudden?

86
00:07:25,523 --> 00:07:28,455
All right all right, I'll come home later.

87
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,764
Mom, I'm busy right now.

88
00:07:32,764 --> 00:07:34,147
This is the NIS.

89
00:07:34,147 --> 00:07:38,671
Your interview number was 1904. Ms Kim Kyung-ja.

90
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:40,976
You have been admitted to the NIS.

91
00:07:40,976 --> 00:07:47,724
No. 1904 Ms. Kim Kyung-ja, you have been admitted to the NIS.

92
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,366
This is the NIS.

93
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:07,510
Your interview number is 1804. Mr. Han Pil-hoon.

94
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,532
You have been admitted to the NIS.

95
00:08:12,938 --> 00:08:16,682
Mr. Han Pil-hoon, you've been admitted to the NIS.

96
00:08:23,223 --> 00:08:27,423
Yes~!

97
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:38,745
The number of students defined as delinquent borrowers because they couldn't pay back their college loans has reached up to 25,000.

98
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:40,691
10 million won in college tuition fees.

99
00:08:40,691 --> 00:08:44,679
Some students are even committing suicide because they could not handle the pressure

100
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,534
but the path to employment is still narrow.

101
00:08:46,946 --> 00:08:50,541
Stop drinking. That won't make the dead bull come back to life.

102
00:08:50,826 --> 00:08:53,367
Foot-and-mouth disease yeah right.

103
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:56,601
I should have just raised dogs.

104
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:58,162
Stop talking about dogs.

105
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,418
Dogs are the best.

106
00:09:00,418 --> 00:09:04,616
I've gone through so many diseases with pigs and cows

107
00:09:04,616 --> 00:09:08,063
but I've never heard anything about disease among dogs

108
00:09:08,063 --> 00:09:11,081
and I've never seen anyone who heard anything about it.

109
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,346
Stop drinking! Your bones won't heal.

110
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:20,528
What kind of world is this? The more I work on the farm, the more debt I have.

111
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,794
I have only my land to trust.

112
00:09:24,794 --> 00:09:29,364
Your land? Do you even have land? Peeing on it will inundate it. That's how big your land is.

113
00:09:29,364 --> 00:09:34,933
Wow, you must pee a lot.

114
00:09:35,218 --> 00:09:37,984
Stop drinking, I'm telling you!

115
00:09:37,984 --> 00:09:42,340
When avain influenza was going on, you said chickens were not birds and they all died.

116
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,729
When pigs were dying, I so told you not to buy them

117
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:48,495
but you were so stubborn, saying you had to buy them when they were cheap. You bought 12

118
00:09:48,495 --> 00:09:50,538
and they all died. We could have just buried them

119
00:09:50,538 --> 00:09:54,818
and now why did you even get at loan to buy cows when they have disease too?

120
00:09:54,818 --> 00:09:57,919
I told you so many times that cows are not worth anything anymore because of the FTA

121
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,658
why did you buy them? Why?

122
00:09:59,658 --> 00:10:01,960
Did I buy them to eat them?

123
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,381
That was the only way to feed you and allow you to go to school.

124
00:10:05,381 --> 00:10:07,684
I bought them because of you! You!

125
00:10:07,684 --> 00:10:11,039
Why are you pointing your finger to me? When did I ever ask you to pay for my tuition?

126
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,835
You brat... Yeah, so what, I couldn't pay your tuition.

127
00:10:14,835 --> 00:10:17,148
So what? Are you looking down on your father because of that?

128
00:10:17,148 --> 00:10:19,821
Stop it! Everyone will hear you!

129
00:10:19,821 --> 00:10:21,751
I want them to hear me.

130
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:25,531
I send you to Seoul and all I get is her looking down on her parents.

131
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:28,560
Go back and get ready to get a job!

132
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,119
Getting a job is my business, not yours.

133
00:10:32,336 --> 00:10:36,028
What, do you think I want to benefit from that?

134
00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:41,253
Do you think I'm going to ask you to buy my a dog or a cultivator if you get a job?

135
00:10:41,253 --> 00:10:44,890
I just want you to live your life! Be responsible!

136
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,440
Fine, I'll buy you that damn cultivator!

137
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,732
I got a job!

138
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,769
Who taught you to talk back like that?

139
00:10:59,861 --> 00:11:03,798
Kyung-ja... you...

140
00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:09,825
What? What did you say?

141
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:11,519
I got a job.

142
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,318
Did you get into broadcasting?

143
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:16,925
Huh?

144
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,619
A cake and champagne too.

145
00:11:23,387 --> 00:11:24,635
Why so suddenly?

146
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:27,051
For no reason. I just wanted a party.

147
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:29,027
Tell me the truth.

148
00:11:30,818 --> 00:11:31,354
What?

149
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:38,283
Do you know?

150
00:11:38,427 --> 00:11:39,531
Of course I do. Did you think I didn't?

151
00:11:40,571 --> 00:11:41,459
How did you know?

152
00:11:42,395 --> 00:11:43,475
I got a call.

153
00:11:43,906 --> 00:11:44,915
Mom.

154
00:11:45,178 --> 00:11:46,155
You had no idea, did you?

155
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,923
You didn't think I would do it, did you? You were shocked, right?

156
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,474
What on earth are you going to do?

157
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:51,762
You should have told me!

158
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:53,499
I didn't tell you because I wanted to surprise  you.

159
00:11:53,835 --> 00:11:54,779
How can  you say that?

160
00:11:55,539 --> 00:11:57,851
Your dad heard about it and he's gone mad.

161
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:58,723
Dad knows about it too?

162
00:11:59,515 --> 00:12:00,376
That can't be!

163
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:02,099
You're home.

164
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,251
I heard about it all.

165
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:05,923
What are you doing?

166
00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:06,740
Please sit down.

167
00:12:07,962 --> 00:12:09,540
I'll tell you about it all. Sit down please.

168
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,428
I know you're mad

169
00:12:18,106 --> 00:12:19,867
but I thought you might have stopped me if I had told you earlier.

170
00:12:20,082 --> 00:12:21,084
Of course I would have stopped you.

171
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,108
What kind of crazy father would allow such a thing?

172
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:25,628
But things have already happened, so don't be mad anymore.

173
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:27,164
Just take a glass of champagne.

174
00:12:27,323 --> 00:12:28,371
You little brat.

175
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,067
What the hell are you doing?

176
00:12:37,386 --> 00:12:39,899
You don't need to do this! I only did what I wanted.

177
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:41,244
What?

178
00:12:41,475 --> 00:12:42,371
You wanted to do that?

179
00:12:42,635 --> 00:12:43,204
Yes.

180
00:12:43,307 --> 00:12:44,627
You...

181
00:12:45,523 --> 00:12:46,691
What is the reason?

182
00:12:46,955 --> 00:12:47,628
It's cool.

183
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:50,195
And the more I think about it, it suits me better than doing business.

184
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:53,899
What?

185
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,428
You blow your car away on a bet

186
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:57,804
and you think that's cool?

187
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:58,980
That suits you?

188
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,436
No, no... wait a minute Father

189
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:02,995
What I'm saying is...

190
00:13:03,123 --> 00:13:06,227
You're 30 now. You should at least act as a decent human being.

191
00:13:06,675 --> 00:13:08,043
What I'm saying is... the civil servant exam.

192
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:09,940
You waste your time on that civil servant exam.

193
00:13:10,363 --> 00:13:11,451
And then you spend that time to lose your car and gamble?

194
00:13:12,107 --> 00:13:14,556
Do you even stop and think about your actions?

195
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:15,980
Let me talk.

196
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:16,876
What do you have to say?

197
00:13:17,843 --> 00:13:20,156
10 mouths, no, 11 mouths wouldn't be enough for you to explain your actions.

198
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:24,395
If you don't have ambitions, at least do as you're told.

199
00:13:25,163 --> 00:13:26,827
You... you know how young people these days

200
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:29,627
bet their lives to get a job?

201
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:35,251
Do you even know how much they struggle just to get one line on their resume?

202
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:38,459
You don't even know that, so what do you have to say?

203
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:41,427
Fine. What could I possibly know?

204
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,043
I'm simply a guy trying to pass the civil servant exam.

205
00:13:43,714 --> 00:13:45,995
How can you talk to your father like that? Just kneel and say you're sorry.

206
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,996
Go out right now and get your car back.

207
00:13:49,186 --> 00:13:49,844
I can't.

208
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:50,508
Do it!

209
00:13:51,211 --> 00:13:53,579
Losing 10 won or losing your life amount to the same thing for a man.

210
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:56,349
Go and find your car back.

211
00:13:56,891 --> 00:13:58,819
I don't think he could find it now.

212
00:13:59,707 --> 00:14:01,739
What if he gets into a fight?

213
00:14:01,962 --> 00:14:04,555
I know, I've had my fair share of fights in my days

214
00:14:05,035 --> 00:14:07,060
if you risk your life on it, there's nothing you can't do.

215
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,068
Go and get it back.

216
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:11,491
It was a fair fight and I have no intention of getting it back.

217
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:13,411
I'll make money and I'll pay you back for the car.

218
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:14,531
What?

219
00:14:15,675 --> 00:14:18,075
You think this is about the price of the car?

220
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:18,939
Yes.

221
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:20,803
You know nothing but money.

222
00:14:20,946 --> 00:14:22,541
How can you?

223
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:26,276
How can you say that? Go! Leave! I don't want to see you ever again!

224
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:27,770
I'm going!

225
00:14:29,883 --> 00:14:31,587
Why are you doing this to me?

226
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:34,043
What?

227
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:36,539
Then... then...

228
00:14:36,946 --> 00:14:38,436
Is it the Agency for National Security Planning?

229
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,092
Oh my dear, honey.

230
00:14:41,242 --> 00:14:43,316
It's the ANSP. The ANSP!

231
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:45,084
It's not the ANSP, it's the NIS.

232
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,140
Potato Potahto!

233
00:14:48,563 --> 00:14:50,851
I haven't made up my mind if I want to go or not.

234
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,275
You had such a hard time studying during all this time

235
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:03,828
and we didn't even pay you your tuition, even once.

236
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,043
We didn't do anything for you as parents.

237
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:09,331
You struggled on your own.

238
00:15:09,554 --> 00:15:10,979
You made it on your own.

239
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:16,275
Kyung-ja.

240
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:26,907
Kyung-ja, give me one shot.

241
00:15:32,843 --> 00:15:35,692
Give me more! This is not some precious medicine, no need to be cheap.

242
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,813
Good good.

243
00:15:44,516 --> 00:15:46,069
Here, you have one.

244
00:15:46,492 --> 00:15:48,309
It's ok, it's from your father.

245
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:50,822
I didn't really decide if I want to go or not...
Take it!

246
00:15:54,404 --> 00:15:55,493
Good work.

247
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,965
My dear daughter, good work.

248
00:16:04,036 --> 00:16:05,581
Thank you.

249
00:16:11,293 --> 00:16:17,021
That's why you danced in the bus and fell down the other day.

250
00:16:17,868 --> 00:16:18,893
Give me some more.

251
00:16:19,332 --> 00:16:22,069
Do you think this is some kind of medicine? You can't drink twice.

252
00:16:22,276 --> 00:16:23,453
No.

253
00:16:24,836 --> 00:16:26,621
By any chance...

254
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,925
it's not like you're going to North Korea or something, right?

255
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:33,069
If they tell you to go, say you don't want to.

256
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,133
Don't just do everything they tell you.

257
00:16:36,332 --> 00:16:37,645
I'm telling you, I'm going to work in broadcasting.

258
00:16:38,092 --> 00:16:40,405
How can you compare ANSP to broadcasting?

259
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:50,173
You know, back in the days, you mention the ANSP and even a flying bird would drop to earth.

260
00:16:53,228 --> 00:16:54,557
Kyung-ja.

261
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:56,429
Thank you.

262
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:59,500
Thank you so much.

263
00:16:59,836 --> 00:17:00,805
Kyung-ja.

264
00:17:01,876 --> 00:17:05,158
I wanted to die with my cow

265
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,549
but now I can live, thanks to you.

266
00:17:07,796 --> 00:17:09,813
You saved your father.

267
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:11,669
I haven't really decided...

268
00:17:13,388 --> 00:17:15,397
This is not the time to cry.

269
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,844
Go and tell the village head

270
00:17:19,396 --> 00:17:20,701
call him on his cell phone.

271
00:17:21,995 --> 00:17:22,909
Why the village head?

272
00:17:24,268 --> 00:17:28,133
Do you have wit at all?

273
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,197
We should throw a party to the village!

274
00:17:34,564 --> 00:17:35,909
Sure, village party.

275
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:38,564
I feel like I should open an exposition.

276
00:17:38,707 --> 00:17:40,901
Mom, Dad, I'm telling you, I'm going to take the exam in broadcasting.

277
00:17:41,164 --> 00:17:43,381
So what, do you think taking the exam will get you a job?

278
00:17:43,548 --> 00:17:48,077
Of course.
Work at the ANSP, get paid, and later, you can take the exam.

279
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,701
It's not like the broadcasting companies are going to disappear.

280
00:17:51,852 --> 00:17:53,452
We should live up to her now

281
00:17:53,796 --> 00:17:55,148
Maybe I should get a perm.

282
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,749
Change your shirt at least.

283
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,797
Come on, call him!

284
00:19:14,756 --> 00:19:15,988
You're the broadcasting company.

285
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,637
And you're the NIS.

286
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,653
All right, make your choice.
Rock paper scissors!

287
00:19:22,332 --> 00:19:24,348
Yes! The broadcasting company wins!

288
00:19:24,836 --> 00:19:25,789
Everything should be done in three matches.

289
00:19:26,468 --> 00:19:27,269
Rock paper scissors.

290
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:29,261
Rock paper scissors.

291
00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:33,261
What is this?

292
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:34,677
What am I doing?

293
00:19:39,189 --> 00:19:41,044
A village party? Sure.

294
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,021
I feel like I should hold an exposition.

295
00:19:58,604 --> 00:19:59,757
Fine.

296
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:02,461
It's not like the broadcasting company is going to disappear.

297
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,877
My dear wife.

298
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,780
Go away!

299
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,748
Be quiet!

300
00:20:15,331 --> 00:20:16,516
Eun-jung is studying for her exam.

301
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:18,013
Eun-jung!

302
00:20:18,516 --> 00:20:19,174
Be quiet!

303
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,525
Eun-jung, your daddy's here.

304
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,949
You're home.

305
00:20:26,116 --> 00:20:27,629
My dear daughter.

306
00:20:27,908 --> 00:20:29,260
You reek of alcohol!

307
00:20:30,308 --> 00:20:31,068
Go sleep.

308
00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:33,701
What? Go sleep?

309
00:20:35,404 --> 00:20:37,533
That little brat, that's how she talks to her father?

310
00:20:37,668 --> 00:20:38,701
Go sleep?

311
00:20:39,436 --> 00:20:40,861
Am I your buddy?

312
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:42,725
Go sleep?

313
00:20:42,852 --> 00:20:44,117
What is wrong with you? Come here!

314
00:20:44,236 --> 00:20:45,061
Be quiet!

315
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:46,300
I told you, she's having her exam.

316
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:49,429
That brat.

317
00:20:50,756 --> 00:20:52,501
Is your father more important

318
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:53,677
or your exam?

319
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:55,061
My my.

320
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,605
How dare you just lie? You haven't even washed yourself.

321
00:20:59,516 --> 00:21:03,244
Why do I have to wash everyday?

322
00:21:04,572 --> 00:21:05,716
Let me rest for a while.

323
00:21:06,413 --> 00:21:07,148
I'm tired.

324
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:08,989
Why did you drink in the first place?

325
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:10,189
Not a day goes by without you drinking.

326
00:21:13,132 --> 00:21:14,925
Do you think I drank for no reason?

327
00:21:16,436 --> 00:21:18,573
I all drank it for my country.

328
00:21:19,492 --> 00:21:21,092
That country of yours!

329
00:21:21,732 --> 00:21:22,620
God!

330
00:21:23,388 --> 00:21:25,060
Your country only pays you like a church mouse.

331
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,445
You don't even care about Eun-jung do you?

332
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:30,285
Are you going to leave her like that?

333
00:21:30,804 --> 00:21:32,525
If you can't send her abroad like others

334
00:21:32,844 --> 00:21:34,613
you have to at least get her an English tutor.

335
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:37,029
You take care of it.

336
00:21:37,148 --> 00:21:37,933
I take care of it?

337
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:40,372
What? What?

338
00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:43,044
Do you even know how expensive private tutoring is?

339
00:21:45,412 --> 00:21:47,717
I hear you hear lots of good information on investment.

340
00:21:48,076 --> 00:21:50,293
Do something and pay for her private lessons.

341
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,269
And we have to pay back our loan for the house too!

342
00:22:00,364 --> 00:22:01,532
I got appointed as discipline officer.

343
00:22:02,348 --> 00:22:04,389
I won't be home for a few months from tomorrow

344
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,421
so get me my things.

345
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:07,245
What?

346
00:22:07,724 --> 00:22:08,773
Are you crazy?

347
00:22:09,116 --> 00:22:09,805
Tomorrow?

348
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,029
Listen to me carefully honey.

349
00:22:11,148 --> 00:22:12,293
Is work more important to you or your family?

350
00:22:12,788 --> 00:22:14,029
If we're going to live like this, give me a divorce instead.

351
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:19,101
When I'm done with this, I will be dispatched to the US.

352
00:22:19,228 --> 00:22:19,844
I don't care.

353
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,565
Give me a divorce.

354
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:28,812
The US?

355
00:22:29,812 --> 00:22:30,956
Yes. In a year.

356
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,470
We're going to the US.

357
00:22:34,316 --> 00:22:37,357
We'll be rid of our lingering past

358
00:22:39,268 --> 00:22:40,461
and we'll go to the States.

359
00:22:41,036 --> 00:22:41,853
What about me?

360
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,893
Of course you're coming too.

361
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,453
The NIS will pay for school tuition

362
00:22:48,036 --> 00:22:49,941
so Eun-jung can go to university in the States.

363
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:52,420
Honey.

364
00:22:53,964 --> 00:22:55,909
I'll be less busy than here.

365
00:22:57,468 --> 00:23:00,757
Let's go on trips and stuff like that.

366
00:23:03,036 --> 00:23:04,669
Honey!

367
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,309
Calm down.

368
00:23:06,764 --> 00:23:08,749
Are we really going to the States?

369
00:23:09,637 --> 00:23:11,484
Why do you think I got the job as discipline officer?

370
00:23:12,316 --> 00:23:13,709
Honey!

371
00:23:19,651 --> 00:23:21,150
Hey! What are you doing?

372
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,458
Sorry sorry.

373
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:24,852
This is absurd.

374
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:27,959
Sir, the Mudong market please. Quick quick.

375
00:23:40,436 --> 00:23:41,812
All right.

376
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:45,337
Jin Sun-mi, fighting!

377
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,689
Hi.

378
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:14,858
Oh, hi.

379
00:24:17,826 --> 00:24:19,855
Do you want some help?
No, it's all right.

380
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,972
We met during the interview, right?

381
00:24:29,972 --> 00:24:32,266
Yes, thank you and sorry for that.

382
00:24:33,188 --> 00:24:34,463
Congratulations on your admission.

383
00:24:34,568 --> 00:24:36,660
Yes, you too.

384
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:40,309
What is his deal?

385
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:44,887
Put your phone in the enveloppen and put it in the box.

386
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:50,658
Put it in the box, shut up and sit down quietly.

387
00:24:50,858 --> 00:24:52,270
Go in.

388
00:24:53,986 --> 00:24:55,159
Put it in the box.

389
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:07,491
Everyone aboard?

390
00:25:07,491 --> 00:25:08,912
Yes!

391
00:25:09,658 --> 00:25:11,360
This is the NIS bus, right?

392
00:25:14,844 --> 00:25:15,591
Take it off.

393
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:16,571
Yes ma'am.

394
00:25:22,138 --> 00:25:23,765
Your sunglasses.

395
00:25:23,765 --> 00:25:25,544
Oh, ok.

396
00:25:33,471 --> 00:25:34,731
Go sit down. Don't talk.

397
00:25:34,731 --> 00:25:35,678
Yes!

398
00:25:37,449 --> 00:25:38,863
Let's go.

399
00:25:41,283 --> 00:25:42,629
Hi.

400
00:25:42,825 --> 00:25:44,216
Thank you.

401
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:03,449
Why don't we introduce each other?

402
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,804
Let's be quiet. It's an order.

403
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:11,965
This is not some research institute. What is wrong with the ambiance?

404
00:26:38,262 --> 00:26:40,370
Hey, you! Kim Seo-won!

405
00:26:43,376 --> 00:26:45,507
I can see you're Kim Seo-won!

406
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,624
Give it back!

407
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:56,994
Good to see you. You're dead now.

408
00:26:56,994 --> 00:26:57,941
Hey you!

409
00:26:58,569 --> 00:27:00,015
You two, get off.

410
00:27:12,572 --> 00:27:16,571
If you don't get back in time, you're out. We don't need people like you!

411
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,568
You have quite a steady sense of fashion.

412
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,198
What are you going to do about my car?

413
00:27:33,198 --> 00:27:34,458
Do it by the law.

414
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,686
Well, I can see your the daughter of a diplomat, exercising your public power.

415
00:27:39,026 --> 00:27:41,864
By the way, are you really the daughter of a diplomat?

416
00:27:41,864 --> 00:27:43,771
No diplomat living in that neighborhood had a daughter.

417
00:27:43,771 --> 00:27:45,639
My dad is a diplomat.

418
00:27:46,422 --> 00:27:47,451
Oh yeah?

419
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,481
Hey! Hey!

420
00:27:54,182 --> 00:27:56,972
Hey you thief! Give me back my stuff!

421
00:27:56,972 --> 00:27:58,988
You con! What, I'm going to stop just because you tell me to?

422
00:27:58,988 --> 00:28:00,721
You're dead!

423
00:28:01,738 --> 00:28:03,130
Stop right there!

424
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,800
I'm going to check if your address is right.

425
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,155
Give it back!

426
00:28:06,155 --> 00:28:07,277
Why? Are you hiding something?

427
00:28:07,277 --> 00:28:09,070
Stop!

428
00:28:13,934 --> 00:28:16,993
There's only one diplomat named Kim Young-chul in Korea.

429
00:28:16,993 --> 00:28:19,017
But he only has two sons.

430
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:20,867
Twins.

431
00:28:21,871 --> 00:28:24,896
I'm sure you didn't lie on the date.

432
00:28:24,896 --> 00:28:27,629
But if you did, I'm suing you for fraud.

433
00:28:28,203 --> 00:28:30,419
You and that woman CEO of the firm.

434
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:32,486
You two will both go to jail.

435
00:28:32,814 --> 00:28:35,042
Han Pil-hoon ssi, I'm very sorry.

436
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,092
I sincerely apologize.

437
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:42,020
But messing with someone else's life, that's all on you.

438
00:28:43,578 --> 00:28:46,244
Let's make it even and give me back my enveloppe.

439
00:28:46,846 --> 00:28:48,025
What if I don't want to?

440
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,556
I'm going to kill you.

441
00:28:53,241 --> 00:28:55,018
Go ahead.

442
00:29:22,925 --> 00:29:24,035
I guess we're here.

443
00:29:24,035 --> 00:29:26,155
Where? Where?

444
00:29:44,581 --> 00:29:45,959
My back!

445
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:50,744
Damn it!

446
00:30:04,133 --> 00:30:05,166
Ok.

447
00:30:07,656 --> 00:30:08,843
The barang bridge.

448
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:12,044
You think you're getting away this time again?

449
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,999
Hello, I'm on the barang bridge

450
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:24,213
My name is Kim Won-suk, and I'm the discipline officer in charge of you from now on.

451
00:30:24,213 --> 00:30:28,197
Your evaluation will be turned into grades and will follow you forever.

452
00:30:28,717 --> 00:30:34,361
But what is more important than your grades is my evaluation.

453
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,640
But you are not worth my evaluation.

454
00:30:43,602 --> 00:30:46,433
You give up on your comrade from the very first day?

455
00:30:51,253 --> 00:30:53,477
One straight way for my country.

456
00:30:54,406 --> 00:30:57,201
On that way you are bound to be with colleagues.

457
00:30:58,111 --> 00:31:01,617
As a punishment for leaving your colleage behind, you will have a penalty of 15 points.

458
00:31:02,383 --> 00:31:06,946
Just so you know, a penalty of 50 points gets you fired.

459
00:31:11,194 --> 00:31:12,412
Anyone opposed?

460
00:31:17,054 --> 00:31:20,533
We were definitely ordered to stay quiet when we got on the bus.

461
00:31:20,533 --> 00:31:22,959
But they were the ones who made a fuss and were kicked out.

462
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:27,716
Isn't it unfair that they're the ones who did wrong and we're the one being punished for it?

463
00:31:27,716 --> 00:31:29,192
Then get out.

464
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:31,705
It's unfair, so why go through with it?

465
00:31:31,705 --> 00:31:33,672
Pack your bags and go live in a fair world.

466
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:37,435
No ma'am.

467
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:43,320
Anyone else opposed?

468
00:31:49,285 --> 00:31:53,748
All right, it's all unanimous, so you will be given a penalty of 15 points.

469
00:31:54,564 --> 00:31:57,817
While you're sitting her comfortably

470
00:31:57,817 --> 00:32:02,929
don't forget that your colleagues are fighting for their life to get back here on time.

471
00:32:05,718 --> 00:32:09,134
It's so cold. You'll see when I get you!

472
00:32:09,134 --> 00:32:11,347
Go a little bit faster.

473
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:12,977
I'm going as fast as I can.

474
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,955
It's so damn cold!

475
00:32:26,602 --> 00:32:28,993
Hey! Hey! Over there!

476
00:32:28,993 --> 00:32:32,468
Go there!

477
00:32:33,613 --> 00:32:35,441
Hey! You! Stop right there!

478
00:32:35,441 --> 00:32:37,050
Hey!

479
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,615
Hey! Hey!

480
00:32:40,148 --> 00:32:42,548
Hey! Get off! Get off!

481
00:32:42,548 --> 00:32:46,074
Sir, I don't know this man. Please go faster.

482
00:32:46,815 --> 00:32:48,778
Stop right there!

483
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,847
Hey!

484
00:32:50,847 --> 00:32:51,902
Stop right there!

485
00:32:51,902 --> 00:32:54,299
Damn it!

486
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:56,989
Go away!

487
00:32:56,989 --> 00:32:59,144
What? Do your best!

488
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:01,184
Get away!

489
00:33:02,536 --> 00:33:04,906
What? You're blocking?

490
00:33:13,003 --> 00:33:14,513
Sir, please go faster.

491
00:33:14,513 --> 00:33:17,574
Hey, I really didn't want to get this far

492
00:33:18,033 --> 00:33:19,557
What are you doing?

493
00:33:20,723 --> 00:33:22,486
What are you going to do with that?

494
00:33:22,486 --> 00:33:25,567
Don't do it! It's enough!
Get ready!

495
00:33:30,449 --> 00:33:33,281
Learn!

496
00:33:33,281 --> 00:33:35,419
You're dead.

497
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,653
Hey, don't do that.

498
00:33:40,653 --> 00:33:42,550
Get this!

499
00:33:51,027 --> 00:33:53,304
Hey!

500
00:33:53,304 --> 00:33:55,091
Stop right there!
Faster!

501
00:33:55,091 --> 00:33:56,547
I'm going to kill you!

502
00:33:56,547 --> 00:33:59,099
Go! Go!

503
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:00,590
Hey!

504
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:05,021
So he ran away from home and you can't get in touch with  him.

505
00:34:05,021 --> 00:34:08,697
You have to do this investigation the proper way.

506
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:14,382
My friend is a district attorney and I told him, so he'll give you a call.

507
00:34:14,382 --> 00:34:18,001
Yes, sure sure. We all have DAs.

508
00:34:18,001 --> 00:34:20,397
You have to find our Pil-hoon.

509
00:34:20,397 --> 00:34:22,036
He's our only son.

510
00:34:22,607 --> 00:34:28,943
I've ran away from home in my days, but we have to look for him, that's when they come back home.

511
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:31,772
Well, you didn't have to do this. Thank you.

512
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:42,501
On your way out, put this in the recycling bin.

513
00:34:42,501 --> 00:34:45,065
You work hard in this department

514
00:34:45,065 --> 00:34:47,000
Hey everyone have a drink!

515
00:34:51,037 --> 00:34:55,076
It's not like he earns millions working here. What a rude man.

516
00:34:56,686 --> 00:34:58,818
Why did you get rid of him?

517
00:34:58,818 --> 00:35:02,508
Security is your life and mission.

518
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:07,700
So everyday you start with this oath on security and end the day with it.

519
00:35:15,604 --> 00:35:17,578
Go and sit down.

520
00:35:27,423 --> 00:35:30,509
On the signature part, use the alias you will be using from now on.

521
00:35:30,509 --> 00:35:33,319
Aliases will help you avoid exposing your identity

522
00:35:33,319 --> 00:35:36,763
and will enforce your security and those around you.

523
00:35:36,763 --> 00:35:39,202
And thus it will be a way to protect your country.

524
00:35:39,749 --> 00:35:43,358
Your alias may be used on your passport, so write it down in English and Chinese characters.

525
00:35:50,591 --> 00:35:55,336
One straight way to your country.

526
00:35:59,955 --> 00:36:02,362
You two who were late.

527
00:36:02,362 --> 00:36:03,197
Come out with your oath.

528
00:36:03,197 --> 00:36:04,297
Yes sir!

529
00:36:11,262 --> 00:36:14,013
From now on, you two will be responsible for the security oath.

530
00:36:14,013 --> 00:36:15,822
Can't I do it with someone else?

531
00:36:15,822 --> 00:36:18,799
Why? You don't like him?

532
00:36:18,799 --> 00:36:20,318
That's right, I don't like her.

533
00:36:26,569 --> 00:36:27,567
You think this is funny?

534
00:36:32,999 --> 00:36:35,024
How dare you say you don't like?

535
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:38,367
Change that attitude.

536
00:36:38,757 --> 00:36:41,375
Your peer is more precious than your own life.

537
00:36:41,843 --> 00:36:43,279
You don't like her?

538
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:47,304
No, I do like her.

539
00:36:47,476 --> 00:36:48,720
What about you?

540
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,197
I will do it.

541
00:36:50,197 --> 00:36:52,416
Oath.

542
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:58,692
As a proud employee of the NIS

543
00:36:58,692 --> 00:37:05,154
I bear in mind that security is my life and the life of the NIS

544
00:37:05,154 --> 00:37:14,949
and I hereby pledge that I will live and die for my country without my name.

545
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:16,049
At ease.

546
00:37:23,673 --> 00:37:30,170
No one in this world, not even your family, must know that you work for the NIS.

547
00:37:32,454 --> 00:37:37,868
You may think it's easy, but you will definitely feel it in your bones from now on

548
00:37:38,654 --> 00:37:45,206
that it is harder to live without a name than to die without one.

549
00:37:47,533 --> 00:37:50,206
Congratulations on entering the NIS.
Kim Kyung-ja,daughter of Kim Pan-suk and Oh Mak-nae.

550
00:37:56,244 --> 00:37:59,378
Here. have a taste.

551
00:38:00,402 --> 00:38:02,381
That's perfect.

552
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:06,764
There's no need for sons.

553
00:38:06,764 --> 00:38:09,216
Daughters are the best!

554
00:38:09,824 --> 00:38:11,623
I so envy you.

555
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:17,547
You know, from when she was little, being the first at school was the only thing Kyung-ja could do.

556
00:38:17,547 --> 00:38:20,202
I knew she would become big.

557
00:38:20,202 --> 00:38:26,285
Of course. Such a good daughter. Will she give you a plane ticket each season and send you on a trip?

558
00:38:26,285 --> 00:38:31,210
Sure, that's nothing. She will even send the dog of the town on a trip to Keumkang mountain.

559
00:38:32,473 --> 00:38:35,808
Hey, come over here and say something!

560
00:38:37,025 --> 00:38:40,062
Come and have a drink.

561
00:38:40,062 --> 00:38:45,724
Well, well, the NIS! That would even drop a flying bird.

562
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:50,465
That's where all the presidents went through.

563
00:38:50,465 --> 00:38:52,889
No, they were at the security office.

564
00:38:52,889 --> 00:38:54,605
Potato Potahto.

565
00:38:54,605 --> 00:38:59,161
They're different.
Different how? They're all the same.

566
00:38:59,161 --> 00:39:02,261
Just listen to him! He says it's different.

567
00:39:02,261 --> 00:39:07,190
Hey, listen. You know how a long time ago, the newspaper said that Kim Il-sung had been killed.

568
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:11,884
That time the security office said that he was dead, but the ANSP said he wasn't.

569
00:39:11,884 --> 00:39:16,651
Right right.
But we checked afterwards, and he was very much alive.

570
00:39:16,651 --> 00:39:19,715
The ANSP was totally right about that.

571
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:23,028
They're not normal people over there.

572
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:25,035
Our village head is indeed very smart.

573
00:39:25,035 --> 00:39:29,184
And anyways, it's not even the ANSP, it's the NIS.

574
00:39:29,184 --> 00:39:34,905
But why the NIS huh?

575
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:36,672
They messed up with the name.

576
00:39:36,672 --> 00:39:40,139
That's what the government does.

577
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:44,321
Now that Kyung-ja is working and all, you should make more efforts.

578
00:39:45,593 --> 00:39:50,515
I'm just saying, we should profit from it too.

579
00:39:50,515 --> 00:39:54,681
I requested for an expansion of our farming land, but it's not too sure.

580
00:39:56,404 --> 00:40:00,205
What do the people know over there in the town?

581
00:40:00,205 --> 00:40:07,434
The town chief? Well, I'll tell him how to behave.

582
00:40:33,302 --> 00:40:35,132
We should at least get it over.

583
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:38,094
Stop talking about the car. That's your price for insulting me.

584
00:40:39,367 --> 00:40:44,256
Why are you blocking? Move away!

585
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:48,337
You and I, we have to train together at least for a year.

586
00:40:48,337 --> 00:40:51,343
Do you think you can just move on, by avoiding it like this today?

587
00:40:51,343 --> 00:40:55,676
I messed it up from day 1 because of you. I don't want to make it worse.

588
00:40:56,483 --> 00:40:59,185
Hey, you're the one who messed up my style.

589
00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:00,458
Move away.

590
00:41:01,825 --> 00:41:02,885
We meet again.

591
00:41:04,812 --> 00:41:08,415
We haven't been properly introduced. Nice to meet you. I'm Gong Do-ha.

592
00:41:09,357 --> 00:41:10,548
I'm Kim Seo-won.

593
00:41:10,548 --> 00:41:12,505
We are in the middle of a conversation right now.

594
00:41:12,605 --> 00:41:16,897
We got penalty points thanks to you, but as a peer, I'm sorry to have let you down.

595
00:41:16,897 --> 00:41:18,240
I'm Gong Do-ha.

596
00:41:21,241 --> 00:41:22,289
I'm Han Gil-ro.

597
00:41:22,289 --> 00:41:23,595
Let's get along well, shall we?

598
00:41:33,494 --> 00:41:35,019
Ouch!

599
00:41:35,944 --> 00:41:37,832
He must be quite strong.

600
00:41:41,227 --> 00:41:42,135
See you tomorrow.

601
00:41:42,135 --> 00:41:43,506
Yes, see you tomorrow.

602
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:47,463
Hey! Stop right there! I'm going to kill you.

603
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,722
Hey Kim Seo-won! Kim Seo-won!

604
00:42:46,271 --> 00:42:48,499
This time I'll make it!

605
00:42:48,876 --> 00:42:49,982
Hey!

606
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:52,527
Hey!

607
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:56,767
Oppa!

608
00:42:58,327 --> 00:42:59,651
Hey!

609
00:43:00,651 --> 00:43:02,317
Hey, Si-young is here.

610
00:43:02,317 --> 00:43:03,655
Can Si-young sit here?

611
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:08,859
Hey

612
00:43:08,859 --> 00:43:11,407
What? What? Why? Where are you going?

613
00:43:11,407 --> 00:43:13,460
Oppa! Oppa!

614
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,604
Si-young, let's have a cup of coffee.
Oppa, wait for me.

615
00:43:17,604 --> 00:43:19,827
Let's have a cup of coffee! Si-young!

616
00:43:31,487 --> 00:43:32,934
May I sit?

617
00:43:40,043 --> 00:43:41,440
Thank you.

618
00:43:44,175 --> 00:43:45,187
Are you ok?

619
00:43:45,776 --> 00:43:47,684
What?

620
00:43:47,684 --> 00:43:49,530
You seemed to be having a hard time.

621
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:52,121
Who? Me?

622
00:43:52,121 --> 00:43:54,402
Because of that guy, Han Gil-ro.

623
00:43:55,356 --> 00:43:57,251
Isn't he your ex-boyfriend?

624
00:43:57,785 --> 00:43:59,108
Who said that?

625
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,493
I do.

626
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:03,699
Why do you think that?

627
00:44:03,699 --> 00:44:05,152
He wasn't your boyfriend?

628
00:44:07,012 --> 00:44:09,709
No! Never.

629
00:44:11,633 --> 00:44:13,689
Then who's your boyfriend?

630
00:44:15,397 --> 00:44:17,192
I don't have a boyfriend.

631
00:44:17,192 --> 00:44:20,425
Oh I see.

632
00:44:21,149 --> 00:44:22,335
I don't have a girlfriend either.

633
00:44:24,582 --> 00:44:26,620
I don't like this kind of misunderstanding.

634
00:44:27,325 --> 00:44:31,273
If misunderstandings keep happening, isn't it the fault of the person who keeps making them happen?

635
00:44:31,613 --> 00:44:33,815
It's not a misunderstanding that I made happen.

636
00:44:33,815 --> 00:44:35,276
Then deal with it.

637
00:44:36,565 --> 00:44:43,161
I don't want to pry, but the one misunderstood is always lonely.

638
00:44:45,613 --> 00:44:46,605
Left foot.

639
00:44:47,109 --> 00:44:48,117
Left foot.

640
00:44:48,533 --> 00:44:49,645
Left foot.

641
00:44:50,174 --> 00:44:51,166
Left foot.

642
00:44:51,741 --> 00:44:52,598
Left foot.

643
00:45:02,007 --> 00:45:02,607
You scared me!

644
00:45:03,071 --> 00:45:05,671
Give me back the money for the car, before I post it on the Ministry's website.

645
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:11,688
Do you know how much that costs? It's really expensive! It was a new model.

646
00:45:15,487 --> 00:45:16,384
Do you want to die?

647
00:45:21,711 --> 00:45:22,688
Give me the movey for my car.

648
00:45:25,904 --> 00:45:26,391
Stop right there!

649
00:45:26,896 --> 00:45:27,840
Hey!

650
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,097
Hey!

651
00:45:31,112 --> 00:45:32,376
Love for us, love for the country.

652
00:45:32,511 --> 00:45:33,680
Love for my peers, love for my country.

653
00:45:34,271 --> 00:45:35,557
Love for my peers, love for my country.

654
00:45:35,991 --> 00:45:37,368
Love for my peers, love for my country.

655
00:45:37,887 --> 00:45:39,184
Love for my peers, love for my country.

656
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,585
That's all the love you got? You have to love more!

657
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,015
Love for my peers, love for my country.

658
00:45:43,232 --> 00:45:44,458
Do your best!

659
00:46:00,784 --> 00:46:01,432
Hi.

660
00:46:01,775 --> 00:46:02,808
Si-young ssi.

661
00:46:03,016 --> 00:46:03,752
Hi.

662
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:06,224
You're not going to invite me to your room?

663
00:46:07,151 --> 00:46:08,728
I think you must have a lovely room.

664
00:46:08,919 --> 00:46:09,936
No, not at all.

665
00:46:10,495 --> 00:46:13,424
I haven't even brought half of half of half of what I had at home.

666
00:46:13,911 --> 00:46:15,031
There's nothing really.

667
00:46:15,951 --> 00:46:16,743
Look at you.

668
00:46:17,335 --> 00:46:18,728
Why? Why don't you just move in here?

669
00:46:21,055 --> 00:46:22,008
You went a bit strong there.

670
00:46:22,512 --> 00:46:23,512
Really?

671
00:46:25,047 --> 00:46:28,129
Oh, ever since I got this huge penalty

672
00:46:28,423 --> 00:46:29,992
I don't know why but I always come on too strong.

673
00:46:32,016 --> 00:46:33,016
I did apologize about that.

674
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:36,153
Although it wasn't my fault.

675
00:46:36,705 --> 00:46:38,032
Any fight among lovers is the responsibility of both parties.

676
00:46:38,944 --> 00:46:41,185
You must have done something wrong for your boyfriend to act like that.

677
00:46:41,303 --> 00:46:42,152
He's not my boyfriend.

678
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:44,640
And

679
00:46:44,767 --> 00:46:46,032
I wish you wouldn't be so comfortable in your language.

680
00:46:47,223 --> 00:46:48,432
It's your first time working, right?

681
00:46:49,704 --> 00:46:51,240
I guess you're too young to know

682
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:55,552
but if you act like you deserve to be talked down to, then that's how you will be treated in the real world.

683
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,416
If you've harmed your peers since day 1

684
00:46:58,544 --> 00:46:59,992
then stay low and stay quiet!

685
00:47:00,167 --> 00:47:01,160
And!

686
00:47:01,415 --> 00:47:02,416
Are you here to flirt?

687
00:47:02,919 --> 00:47:04,104
Stop with your love affairs and fights!

688
00:47:10,344 --> 00:47:11,319
Bon appetit.

689
00:47:41,455 --> 00:47:42,321
Han Gil-ro.

690
00:47:43,591 --> 00:47:44,567
You're driving me crazy.

691
00:47:46,345 --> 00:47:47,024
What?

692
00:47:49,208 --> 00:47:50,176
Follow me.

693
00:48:06,424 --> 00:48:07,128
Here.

694
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:11,192
Oath for payment.

695
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:15,456
In relation to the car accident that

696
00:48:15,591 --> 00:48:16,616
happened during my date with Han Gil-ro

697
00:48:16,743 --> 00:48:18,872
I hereby swear I will pay back the following.

698
00:48:19,991 --> 00:48:20,847
According to this oath

699
00:48:21,296 --> 00:48:25,272
I will pay half of the car's worth as soon as the training is over.

700
00:48:27,183 --> 00:48:27,872
Half?

701
00:48:29,255 --> 00:48:30,392
As soon as the training ends?

702
00:48:31,655 --> 00:48:32,592
After one year?

703
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:35,376
We can't go out during training anyways.

704
00:48:36,736 --> 00:48:37,633
If you don't want it, it's fine.

705
00:48:37,759 --> 00:48:38,416
Ok. Ok.

706
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,456
Social security number 860131

707
00:48:42,984 --> 00:48:43,784
2997

708
00:48:43,943 --> 00:48:44,744
883

709
00:48:46,095 --> 00:48:46,784
Is that true?

710
00:48:47,063 --> 00:48:47,792
Yes.

711
00:48:50,191 --> 00:48:50,952
You say it once more.

712
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:53,577
You really don't trust me?

713
00:48:53,983 --> 00:48:54,343
That's right.

714
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:56,936
Your social security number.

715
00:48:57,552 --> 00:48:58,520
860131

716
00:48:58,992 --> 00:48:59,928
2997883

717
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:03,784
Name, Kim Ji-won.

718
00:49:07,303 --> 00:49:08,088
Is that your real name?

719
00:49:08,287 --> 00:49:09,112
Yes, it is.

720
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,528
I was afraid something annoying might happen during the date

721
00:49:11,663 --> 00:49:13,169
so I just replaced the middle syllable.

722
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:14,928
For real?

723
00:49:15,175 --> 00:49:17,344
Trust me. It's not a lie.

724
00:49:18,544 --> 00:49:19,200
All right.

725
00:49:20,647 --> 00:49:21,576
This document

726
00:49:22,151 --> 00:49:24,496
can be proof that you're not a fraud

727
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,969
but also at the same time a proof that you are a fraud.

728
00:49:28,232 --> 00:49:31,224
If one single thing here is a lie, you're going to the police immediately.

729
00:49:31,448 --> 00:49:33,024
Sure.

730
00:49:33,152 --> 00:49:34,608
Here, you write one as well.

731
00:49:35,792 --> 00:49:36,248
What?

732
00:49:38,487 --> 00:49:39,568
Before you get the money

733
00:49:40,023 --> 00:49:42,632
you will not bother me for any reason

734
00:49:43,071 --> 00:49:44,168
no eye contact whatsoever

735
00:49:44,864 --> 00:49:46,064
and no talking either.

736
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:47,376
Geez.

737
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,713
That's a piece of cake.

738
00:49:50,408 --> 00:49:52,912
I told you, I hate people like you.

739
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:56,112
I like people who work hard, even if they don't have money.

740
00:49:58,103 --> 00:50:00,568
From now on, don't even stand next to me

741
00:50:01,103 --> 00:50:01,928
or sit next to me.

742
00:50:02,407 --> 00:50:03,311
Don't even dream of it.

743
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,161
I won't even lie next to you.

744
00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:26,960
Don't work too hard.

745
00:50:27,488 --> 00:50:28,224
Take a break.

746
00:50:55,567 --> 00:50:56,281
Salute.

747
00:50:56,632 --> 00:50:58,455
Civilians that have been killed by the rebels

748
00:50:58,648 --> 00:51:00,249
today amount to more than 47 in the sole city of Dili.

749
00:51:00,952 --> 00:51:02,880
We can't cover all this

750
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:03,840
with our resources.

751
00:51:04,128 --> 00:51:06,328
I will look for schools or other areas that can be used around here.

752
00:51:06,495 --> 00:51:07,720
All right. Do it soon and report back to me.

753
00:51:07,951 --> 00:51:08,536
Yes sir.

754
00:52:23,991 --> 00:52:24,729
Shoot her.

755
00:52:26,552 --> 00:52:27,592
Shoot now you bastard!

756
00:52:32,255 --> 00:52:33,272
Shoot now!

757
00:52:34,823 --> 00:52:36,128
Shoot!

758
00:52:41,592 --> 00:52:42,952
Shoot!

759
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:37,344
He came in about a month ago under the alias of John Jay.

760
00:53:37,624 --> 00:53:39,784
We found him

761
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:40,688
during our survey of foreigners who came in with an open ticket

762
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,288
Are you kidding me?

763
00:53:42,703 --> 00:53:43,592
What have you been doing for a month?

764
00:53:43,759 --> 00:53:46,464
Do you think I'll be able to count on you until my retirement?

765
00:53:49,015 --> 00:53:51,024
So, who does he want to kill this time?

766
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:53,456
We don't have any special intelligence on it

767
00:53:54,256 --> 00:53:56,424
we are looking among companies with military technology.

768
00:53:57,352 --> 00:53:58,688
That's the bastard who killed Dae-sang

769
00:53:59,136 --> 00:54:01,265
We're not in the States, or China. We're in Korea.

770
00:54:01,695 --> 00:54:04,089
If you can't catch him in this country that is the size of your hand, be ready to give up your jobs.

771
00:54:06,711 --> 00:54:07,480
Who will be in charge of this?

772
00:54:29,648 --> 00:54:30,624
I'll get him.

773
00:54:33,376 --> 00:54:34,418
Pack your things.

774
00:54:37,495 --> 00:54:38,464
As you can see

775
00:54:38,863 --> 00:54:42,472
we will take over Future Tech and according to the method involving third party allocation

776
00:54:42,848 --> 00:54:44,473
we will pass it on to WPA.

777
00:54:46,888 --> 00:54:49,352
As you may know, what we want is patent technology

778
00:54:49,512 --> 00:54:50,688
not a company or man power.

779
00:54:52,191 --> 00:54:53,544
Technology patent for military use.

780
00:54:53,871 --> 00:54:54,744
So there's no further trouble.

781
00:54:55,415 --> 00:54:56,776
You just take over the company

782
00:54:57,135 --> 00:54:59,417
take over the patent, and then get rid of the company.

783
00:55:00,336 --> 00:55:02,216
This is perfectly legal

784
00:55:02,503 --> 00:55:03,711
so it doesn't matter if it's the NIS or the prosecution

785
00:55:03,856 --> 00:55:05,431
they won't be able to touch you.

786
00:55:07,448 --> 00:55:08,408
Here, cheers.

787
00:55:16,111 --> 00:55:17,048
Are we also going to kill him?

788
00:55:17,455 --> 00:55:19,585
We'll first use him as a bait for the people at the NIS

789
00:55:21,327 --> 00:55:22,888
and then we'll kill him or get rid of him.

790
00:55:23,408 --> 00:55:24,848
How many more do we have to kill until it's over?

791
00:55:25,991 --> 00:55:27,136
If you're going to say things like that, you can leave.

792
00:55:30,151 --> 00:55:31,280
Do you like living like this?

793
00:55:34,368 --> 00:55:35,391
i don't live like this because I like it.

794
00:55:37,856 --> 00:55:39,008
I'm living like this because I can't die

795
00:55:40,976 --> 00:55:42,576
before I kill them all.

796
00:55:50,343 --> 00:55:51,544
I told you not to stand next to me.

797
00:55:51,743 --> 00:55:53,120
Do you think I want to do this?

798
00:55:56,888 --> 00:55:57,760
Stand up.

799
00:56:01,439 --> 00:56:02,368
Aren't you doing the oath ceremony?

800
00:56:03,695 --> 00:56:04,536
Oath.

801
00:56:04,727 --> 00:56:05,544
Oath.

802
00:56:06,711 --> 00:56:08,640
What is this? We're in the middle of a very serious ceremony.

803
00:56:15,464 --> 00:56:16,400
Sir.

804
00:56:16,728 --> 00:56:18,120
I have a sore throat.

805
00:56:18,535 --> 00:56:20,153
I can't talk.

806
00:56:22,591 --> 00:56:23,344
Are you sick?

807
00:56:31,512 --> 00:56:33,264
You have some fever.

808
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,760
Go to medical after this and get yourself some medicine.

809
00:56:36,623 --> 00:56:37,208
OK?

810
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:39,880
Anyone wants to replace her?

811
00:56:40,183 --> 00:56:40,968
I will do it.

812
00:56:53,123 --> 00:56:54,027
Oath.

813
00:56:54,322 --> 00:56:54,923
How are the kids?

814
00:56:55,107 --> 00:56:55,715
Are they useful?

815
00:56:56,562 --> 00:56:57,675
There's still a long way to go.

816
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:01,459
Kids these days have no idea what their country means to them.

817
00:57:01,579 --> 00:57:02,331
What about you?

818
00:57:02,882 --> 00:57:05,516
You used to imitate James Bond too.

819
00:57:05,635 --> 00:57:06,756
James Bond is a patriot.

820
00:57:07,851 --> 00:57:08,755
He's a player patriot.

821
00:57:08,947 --> 00:57:09,892
At least he speaks English well.

822
00:57:14,674 --> 00:57:15,347
How's the position as discipline officer?

823
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:16,611
Well, that's not the problem

824
00:57:18,122 --> 00:57:19,476
It's the path towards the good of my country

825
00:57:19,899 --> 00:57:20,732
I'm worried.

826
00:57:21,099 --> 00:57:23,012
I'm worried you will turn all the newbies like you.

827
00:57:24,323 --> 00:57:25,059
What's wrong with me?

828
00:57:25,259 --> 00:57:26,132
You're just a civil servant.

829
00:57:27,803 --> 00:57:28,755
My dear comrade

830
00:57:29,131 --> 00:57:30,675
how's life treating you?
Let me breathe.

831
00:57:32,314 --> 00:57:33,963
I've devoted my life to this place

832
00:57:34,106 --> 00:57:34,563
that's enough, don't you think?

833
00:57:35,867 --> 00:57:36,532
Are you getting old?

834
00:57:37,083 --> 00:57:37,844
Are you afraid of dying?

835
00:57:37,963 --> 00:57:39,076
I'm more afraid of living.

836
00:57:42,363 --> 00:57:43,347
Don't be the discipline officer.

837
00:57:44,723 --> 00:57:45,227
Why?

838
00:57:46,363 --> 00:57:47,099
You want to take the job?

839
00:57:48,354 --> 00:57:49,347
That bastard is back.

840
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:50,308
JJ.

841
00:57:53,522 --> 00:57:54,492
I'm putting up a team.

842
00:57:58,212 --> 00:57:59,172
Good luck with that.

843
00:57:59,795 --> 00:58:00,579
Come with me.

844
00:58:02,387 --> 00:58:04,731
I don't know if that will be the way to die

845
00:58:06,122 --> 00:58:07,139
or to live.

846
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:14,044
It's hot.

847
00:58:16,179 --> 00:58:17,084
I won't see you out.

848
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:17,795
Go.

849
00:58:25,962 --> 00:58:27,515
The NIS must know by now that I've come back.

850
00:58:28,962 --> 00:58:30,484
The document that Han Ju-man passed on

851
00:58:30,611 --> 00:58:31,516
leak it to the NIS.

852
00:58:32,835 --> 00:58:34,108
When the NIS will be all over it

853
00:58:35,555 --> 00:58:36,947
that's when I'll strike.

854
00:58:39,106 --> 00:58:39,988
It's too dangerous.

855
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:41,795
You will be exposed.

856
00:58:41,922 --> 00:58:42,747
There's nothing dangerous.

857
00:58:44,122 --> 00:58:45,555
They're all amateurs at the NIS.

858
00:58:46,242 --> 00:58:47,396
But hyung

859
00:58:47,555 --> 00:58:48,900
do you remember them all?

860
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:50,300
Why?

861
00:58:51,387 --> 00:58:52,851
Are you afraid I'm going to kill the wrong person?

862
00:58:53,891 --> 00:58:55,499
Killing innocent people...

863
00:58:55,987 --> 00:58:56,691
Jay.

864
00:58:57,954 --> 00:58:58,859
Listen to me carefully.

865
00:59:00,082 --> 00:59:01,572
Among all the organized criminal groups made by man

866
00:59:02,315 --> 00:59:04,732
do you know which one is the least humane and the most cruel?

867
00:59:05,923 --> 00:59:06,668
It's the state.

868
00:59:07,499 --> 00:59:09,467
For their own interests

869
00:59:09,827 --> 00:59:12,100
they will kill thousands of people without any hesitation.

870
00:59:14,971 --> 00:59:16,475
Do you know who are the marching troops for that organization?

871
00:59:17,866 --> 00:59:18,748
They're governmental institutions.

872
00:59:20,003 --> 00:59:21,540
They lead in their support for the government

873
00:59:22,371 --> 00:59:25,476
and it is through that government that they control and kill the people and gain power.

874
00:59:26,843 --> 00:59:29,099
They wrap it up nicely in the name of justice.

875
00:59:32,515 --> 00:59:33,587
My parents

876
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:37,315
Mirae's parents being killed. Is that justice to you?

877
00:59:41,075 --> 00:59:42,204
I don't need anything else.

878
00:59:43,148 --> 00:59:44,724
Us killing them, that's justice.

879
00:59:45,203 --> 00:59:46,276
You have to know one more thing.

880
00:59:47,883 --> 00:59:51,107
Justice will survive until the end.

881
00:59:54,419 --> 00:59:55,131
Don't worry.

882
00:59:56,147 --> 00:59:56,972
I'm not going to die.

883
00:59:58,595 --> 00:59:59,724
Not until I kill them all.

884
01:00:09,338 --> 01:00:11,788
One of the biggest ennemies you have to face.

885
01:00:12,435 --> 01:00:13,403
The lie detector.

886
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:15,524
Through repetitive training once a week

887
01:00:16,323 --> 01:00:19,700
the purpose of it will be to fool this lie detector.

888
01:00:20,035 --> 01:00:20,859
All right.

889
01:00:21,003 --> 01:00:21,691
Ask away.

890
01:00:24,707 --> 01:00:26,515
How long have you been working at the NIS?

891
01:00:28,218 --> 01:00:29,476
I'm not an employee of the NIS.

892
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:31,940
Truth.

893
01:00:34,035 --> 01:00:35,004
Hey erm

894
01:00:35,195 --> 01:00:37,044
you know the video

895
01:00:37,243 --> 01:00:39,179
of the celebrities A and B?

896
01:00:40,307 --> 01:00:44,203
I hear that you have to watch those videos a lot if you work at the NIS.

897
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:47,507
I'm telling you, I'm not an employee of the NIS.

898
01:00:50,034 --> 01:00:50,708
Truth.

899
01:00:51,803 --> 01:00:54,980
Among your missions, did you ever have to kill a spy

900
01:00:55,835 --> 01:00:57,475
or did one of your colleagues die?

901
01:01:06,755 --> 01:01:08,267
I'm an innocent citizen.

902
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:10,140
Truth.

903
01:01:13,259 --> 01:01:16,075
As you can see, if you're an agent, you have to be able to control your emotions

904
01:01:16,283 --> 01:01:18,483
and control your brain waves and your heart rate.

905
01:01:19,778 --> 01:01:20,491
All right then.

906
01:01:21,242 --> 01:01:22,228
Get going, one by one.

907
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:23,363
How does it feel, sitting down?

908
01:01:24,146 --> 01:01:24,836
Nervous?

909
01:01:26,171 --> 01:01:27,100
Scared?

910
01:01:27,755 --> 01:01:28,355
No.

911
01:01:28,683 --> 01:01:29,475
I'm not scared.

912
01:01:30,867 --> 01:01:31,467
Lie.

913
01:01:33,075 --> 01:01:35,019
As an agent of the NIS

914
01:01:36,379 --> 01:01:37,299
are you being disciplined?

915
01:01:38,586 --> 01:01:40,764
I'm not an agent of the NIS.

916
01:01:41,546 --> 01:01:42,291
Lie

917
01:01:42,674 --> 01:01:43,780
How could I ever give him work?

918
01:01:44,355 --> 01:01:46,812
The moment he opens his mouth, all the national secrets will be blown away.

919
01:01:47,803 --> 01:01:48,635
No, the thing is

920
01:01:48,859 --> 01:01:50,628
I'm quite honest, usually.

921
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,051
Lie.

922
01:01:57,139 --> 01:01:58,275
Do you love your country?

923
01:01:58,642 --> 01:02:01,076
Of course. I love my country a lot.

924
01:02:02,771 --> 01:02:03,676
Lie.

925
01:02:07,795 --> 01:02:08,867
Are you an employee of the NIS?

926
01:02:09,763 --> 01:02:10,627
No.

927
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:11,459
Lie.

928
01:02:11,682 --> 01:02:13,427
Have you ever studied on counter-terrorist policies?

929
01:02:14,698 --> 01:02:15,259
No.

930
01:02:15,554 --> 01:02:15,947
Lie.

931
01:02:16,098 --> 01:02:17,267
Do you love your country?

932
01:02:19,098 --> 01:02:19,547
Yes.

933
01:02:19,722 --> 01:02:20,154
I love my country.

934
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:24,443
Truth.

935
01:02:27,242 --> 01:02:27,907
Really?

936
01:02:30,058 --> 01:02:30,915
Are you willing to give up your life?

937
01:02:32,146 --> 01:02:32,907
Yes.

938
01:02:34,162 --> 01:02:35,058
Truth.

939
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:43,635
See?

940
01:02:44,578 --> 01:02:45,859
Through this machine

941
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:48,371
we can differentiate between men like him

942
01:02:49,778 --> 01:02:51,171
and boys like him.

943
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:56,986
Citizens who have not been trained to pass the lie detector

944
01:02:57,130 --> 01:02:58,499
and yet who do pass it

945
01:02:58,681 --> 01:03:00,731
are 1 in 120,000.

946
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:02,331
These are two kinds of people.

947
01:03:03,322 --> 01:03:05,379
They're eith psychopath or a natural spy.

948
01:03:06,762 --> 01:03:08,619
During the past 20 years,

949
01:03:08,738 --> 01:03:10,387
there is only one person

950
01:03:11,026 --> 01:03:12,370
who has passed the lie detector during this training period

951
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:14,227
That person is me.

952
01:03:15,513 --> 01:03:16,258
Are you impressed?

953
01:03:18,794 --> 01:03:19,819
Let's starts, shall we?

954
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:24,859
You're an employee of the NIS.

955
01:03:25,570 --> 01:03:26,842
You're under training.

956
01:03:27,794 --> 01:03:28,307
Is that true?

957
01:03:30,378 --> 01:03:31,235
No.

958
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:32,819
Lie.

959
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:36,587
You know where the training location is at and the entrance code to the building.

960
01:03:38,194 --> 01:03:38,771
Right?

961
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:42,115
I'm not an employee of the NIS.

962
01:03:43,442 --> 01:03:44,026
Lie.

963
01:03:44,562 --> 01:03:46,035
And then starts torture right away.

964
01:03:47,146 --> 01:03:50,434
So that they can find our location and our entrance code.

965
01:03:52,779 --> 01:03:53,211
Next.

966
01:03:53,339 --> 01:03:53,739
Sir.

967
01:03:55,562 --> 01:03:56,891
May we ask questions?

968
01:04:01,002 --> 01:04:01,930
Sure.

969
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:07,066
Kim Seo-won ssi.

970
01:04:07,849 --> 01:04:08,627
What year were you born?

971
01:04:10,786 --> 01:04:11,771
The year of the tiger.

972
01:04:12,802 --> 01:04:13,371
Lie.

973
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:15,251
The year of the tiger.

974
01:04:15,698 --> 01:04:16,779
Lie.

975
01:04:18,698 --> 01:04:19,547
I knew it.

976
01:04:20,706 --> 01:04:22,267
Is your real name Kim Ji-won?

977
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:24,570
Your real name

978
01:04:25,009 --> 01:04:26,155
is it Kim Ji-won?

979
01:04:28,066 --> 01:04:28,899
My real name is

980
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:32,659
Kim Seo-won.

981
01:04:35,058 --> 01:04:35,755
Lie.

982
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:39,050
Your social security number.

983
01:04:39,954 --> 01:04:40,987
860131

984
01:04:41,786 --> 01:04:43,298
2997883

985
01:04:43,522 --> 01:04:44,123
is that true?

986
01:04:46,314 --> 01:04:47,347
I don't remember.

987
01:04:47,922 --> 01:04:48,467
Lie.

988
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:51,611
Is your father

989
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:53,379
a diplomat?

990
01:04:55,922 --> 01:04:56,778
I won't answer questions

991
01:04:56,907 --> 01:04:57,570
about my parents.

992
01:04:57,994 --> 01:04:59,922
Answer it. You don't have the right to remain silent with a lie detector.

993
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:04,875
You clearly told me that your father was a diplomat

994
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:08,083
Is your father the diplomat Kim Young-chul?

995
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:20,563
Answer.

996
01:05:45,914 --> 01:05:46,651
Ask me again.

997
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:48,947
Are you really the daughter of a diplomat?

998
01:05:55,922 --> 01:05:57,163
Yes, my father is a diplomat.

999
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:03,723
If you want to prove that I'm a fraud, go ahead.

1000
01:06:05,122 --> 01:06:07,170
I haven't told you a single lie.

1001
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:35,915
Truth.

1002
01:07:04,196 --> 01:07:04,829
You're either one of two.

1003
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,445
A psycopath or a natural liar.

1004
01:07:07,796 --> 01:07:08,557
Pass or fail?

1005
01:07:08,876 --> 01:07:10,429
This brat.

1006
01:07:10,596 --> 01:07:11,453
She will get big.

1007
01:07:11,924 --> 01:07:12,837
10,000won.

1008
01:07:13,436 --> 01:07:15,036
You will lose everything in one blow.

1009
01:07:15,668 --> 01:07:16,493
Were you on the field?

1010
01:07:18,805 --> 01:07:20,453
The main character in all parties

1011
01:07:21,508 --> 01:07:22,237
is the woman.

1012
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:30,973
Give me!

1013
01:07:31,436 --> 01:07:32,565
Are you stupid? Why do you get yourself treated like that?

1014
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:36,213
What do you believe in?

1015
01:07:36,493 --> 01:07:37,510
The path towards my country.

1016
01:07:37,645 --> 01:07:38,684
Do you want to be kicked out of here?

1017
01:07:39,036 --> 01:07:40,429
There's only one way for me.

1018
01:07:41,372 --> 01:07:42,765
Only for my country.
