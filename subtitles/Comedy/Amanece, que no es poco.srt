Well, hi.

58
00:05:05,278 --> 00:05:08,280
Um, we're the Symondses
from next door.

59
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:10,491
I'm Summer, and this
is my husband Larry.

60
00:05:10,617 --> 00:05:14,078
Hey, neighbors. I just wanted to 
bring you this welcome gift ...

61
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:19,834
of various samples from the new Robustion 
Aphrodite line of beauty products.

62
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:21,585
But I'm sure you're
in no mood for guests.

63
00:05:21,712 --> 00:05:24,296
- Don't ― Don't be silly.
- Come in. Come in.

64
00:05:24,381 --> 00:05:26,298
- I'm Steve Jones.
- Hi.

65
00:05:26,383 --> 00:05:29,010
- Aw.
- Nice to meet you.

66
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:30,302
- Steve.
- Uh, Larry Symonds.

67
00:05:30,387 --> 00:05:31,512
Pleased to meet you.

68
00:05:31,638 --> 00:05:34,807
- This is Jenn and Mick, and I'm Kate.
- Hello.

69
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:36,142
- Hi, Mick. 
- Nice to meet you.

70
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:37,810
- So nice to meet you.
- You too.

71
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:41,188
Do you have kids? Because they should 
come over and meet Mick and Jenn.

72
00:05:41,273 --> 00:05:43,566
Actually, we don't. I was, uh ―

73
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,984
I wasn't able ―
Oh. What?

74
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,320
I know that with a big 
move in "conduction" ...

00:05:48,405 --> 00:05:50,656
with a woman's naturally
fluctuating hormones,

76

it can leave your skin a wreck,

77
00:05:52,534 --> 00:05:54,493
but you'll find that 
the Aphrodite line ...

78
00:05:54,578 --> 00:05:57,371
of beauty products can 
really give you a glow.

79
00:05:57,456 --> 00:05:59,415
I bet. Look at you.
You're a vision of beauty.

80
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:01,917
Well, thank you.

81
00:06:02,002 --> 00:06:03,878
You're welcome.

82
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:06,422
Larry, wanna grab a cold one?

83
00:06:06,548 --> 00:06:07,506
Come on. Okay?

84
00:06:07,632 --> 00:06:09,300
Sure. Yeah, sure. Okay.

85
00:06:09,384 --> 00:06:10,926
Come on in.

86
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,473
- Well, would you like a tour?
- Sure.

87
00:06:15,557 --> 00:06:18,851
- These rooms are divine.
- Thank you.

88
00:06:18,935 --> 00:06:22,980
You should come over to our 
house, and we can talk decor.

89
00:06:23,065 --> 00:06:25,566
Oh, I would love that.

90
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,196
Boy. I'm very "impassionate"
about interiors myself.

91
00:06:31,656 --> 00:06:33,574
So what line of work
is your husband in?

92
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:37,119
Well, you know, he does a little 
of this and a little of that,

93
00:06:37,204 --> 00:06:40,372
and mostly he works
on keeping me happy.

94
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:43,167
- Ahh. │- Oh, you're right.
This is really a good beer.

95
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:45,002
I told you that 
would hit the spot.

96
00:06:50,258 --> 00:06:52,134
Hey, that was a, uh, nice visit ...

97
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,971
with the Symondses today, wasn't it?
- Yeah. It was.

98
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:59,183
I think that you may have
overdone it a little.

99
00:07:00,352 --> 00:07:03,020
What do you mean?

100
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:06,774
Uh, "a vision of beauty"?

101
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:08,943
Aw, come on. I was just having fun.

102
00:07:09,027 --> 00:07:11,112
And she loved it. Made her day.

103
00:07:11,238 --> 00:07:15,491
- Well, I love your enthusiasm.
- Thank you.

104
00:07:15,575 --> 00:07:18,702
I just think you need to go slow.

105
00:07:18,787 --> 00:07:21,747
Oh, this is a soft, soft bed.

106
00:07:21,832 --> 00:07:26,252
I could really get 
used to being in it.

107
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:28,921
Mm-hmm. It's nice.

108
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:32,049
- Sweet dreams.
- Good night.

109
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:16,177
All right. This is a very big day.

110

Your first day of your new school.

111
00:08:18,638 --> 00:08:21,849
- Important you make a good impression.
- I have my sweater right there.

112
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:24,393
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

114
00:08:27,856 --> 00:08:29,773
So what are you doing today, Daddy?

115
00:08:29,858 --> 00:08:32,610
I am, uh ― I'm gonna try 
to scare up a golf game.

116
00:08:32,736 --> 00:08:35,738
- What are you gonna do?
- Oh, you know, a little mani-pedi,

117
00:08:35,822 --> 00:08:38,616
maybe a facial, get my hair done.

118
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,035
I think we're gonna do
really, really well here.

119
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:43,037
But you guys are 
gonna be late.

120
00:08:43,163 --> 00:08:45,122

and I know you didn't
get that around here.

158
00:10:54,085 --> 00:10:57,338
- We just moved here yesterday.
- Ah.

159
00:10:57,422 --> 00:10:59,965
So how on earth
did you find me?

160
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,259
Well, I ... do my research,

161
00:11:02,385 --> 00:11:06,764
and anyone who's anyone knows you're 
the best. Isn't that the truth.

162
00:11:06,848 --> 00:11:10,351
And there isn't anyone who's 
anyone that I don't know.

163
00:11:11,936 --> 00:11:13,645
Mm-hmm.

164
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:20,944
So. What are we going to do today?

165
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:24,615
I'm a mess from the move.
I think I need an overhaul.

166
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:27,951
Sugar, if this is a mess, then 
I want whatever you're taking.

167
00:11:31,623 --> 00:11:34,041
- Whoo.
- That'll play.

168
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,627
Nothin' wrong with that.

169
00:11:39,464 --> 00:11:41,465
- Clean livin'.
- Yeah.

170
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:45,427
- Nice shot.
- Thank you.

171
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:49,223
- Have you seen these new MP-52 irons?
- I don't believe I have.

172
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:51,183
They have a lower, 
deeper center of gravity,

173
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:53,185
so they're more forgiving.
- Really?

174
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:55,687
Yeah, so if they'll forgive me ―

175
00:11:55,772 --> 00:11:57,439
they'll forgive anyone.
- Very nice.

176
00:11:57,524 --> 00:12:00,192
Excuse me.

177
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:03,570
- Hey, baby. 
- Hi, baby. How's your game?

178
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:05,864
My game's great. How's your game?

179
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:08,700
- Fantastic. I was just missing you.
- Bye-bye, Kate.

180
00:12:08,827 --> 00:12:10,702
- It was great meeting you.
- You too, Sylvia.

181
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:13,705
And I'll see you tomorrow for that 
hot yoga class. │- Right. Bye, sweetie.

182
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:16,667
- I see you're making some new friends.
- Well, I'm trying.

183
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:20,421
- That's hot.
- Oh, I love this.

184
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:23,924
- The phone's great, but I was talking about 
the husband. │- He's pretty yummy too.

185
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:27,302
- Hello?
- Don't come home too tired.

186
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:30,347
- Oh.
- Bye. Love you.

187
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:32,391
I love you.

188
00:12:35,311 --> 00:12:38,689
- You lucky bitch.
- I know.

189
00:12:38,773 --> 00:12:41,024
You know what I'm gonna do for you?

190
00:12:41,109 --> 00:12:44,528
I'm gonna have a special lunch
to introduce you to my ladies.

191
00:12:44,654 --> 00:12:47,656
- I would love that.
- You got it.

192
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,533
Hello?

193
00:12:49,617 --> 00:12:51,910
How'd it go today?

194
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:58,041
- Very well.
- Did you make friends?

195
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:01,587
I did. I made friends.

196
00:13:01,671 --> 00:13:04,256
Oh. Did you get their,
uh, contact info?

197
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,300
Of course I did.

198
00:13:07,343 --> 00:13:09,386
Great. Well, your dinner's
in the fridge.

199
00:14:36,349 --> 00:14:38,559
You like that?

200
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,687
- Jenn?
- Ow!

201
00:14:41,813 --> 00:14:43,605
- Come on. Let's go.
- Shit!

202
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,065
- Let go of me!
- Kate ―

203
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:47,401
Get your clothes on.

204
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:49,486
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I'll handle this.

205
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:52,406
No. Nothing happened.

206
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,408
Ladies, come on.

207
00:14:54,492 --> 00:14:59,663
Goddamn it, Jenn. We told them that 
this was not going to happen again.

208
00:14:59,789 --> 00:15:02,583
- What, are you jealous?
- Oh, that's ridiculous.

209
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:04,793
Now, hold on!

210
00:15:06,421 --> 00:15:08,797
If you're not gonna 
do him, why can't I?

211
00:15:08,923 --> 00:15:11,592
- Do you want me to call KC?
- Freak's back in action, huh?

212
00:15:11,718 --> 00:15:13,802
- Fuck you!
- Mick, stay out of this.

213
00:15:13,886 --> 00:15:15,846
Go get in your room now.

214
00:15:19,517 --> 00:15:21,310
Night, Dad.

215
00:15:23,062 --> 00:15:24,563
Shit.

216
00:15:29,611 --> 00:15:32,321
- Why did you let her in your room?
- Come on. I was sleeping.

217
00:15:32,405 --> 00:15:34,364
You're not blaming me?

218
00:15:35,908 --> 00:15:37,951
She's got a problem.

219
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:40,245
What am I supposed to do?

220
00:15:41,664 --> 00:15:43,582
Well, we're not gonna
solve this tonight,

221
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,584
so we're gonna discuss 
it in the morning.

222
00:16:16,282 --> 00:16:19,076
Good morning. You have a nice 
glow about you. Did you sleep well?

223
00:16:19,202 --> 00:16:22,204
- That's very funny.
- Hi.

224
00:16:22,288 --> 00:16:24,039
- I really think we should talk ―
- Good morning.

225
00:16:24,123 --> 00:16:25,666
Good morning. 
We should talk about ―

226
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:27,167
Good morning.
What happened ― Morning.

227
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:29,169
Good morning.
What happened last night?

228
00:16:29,253 --> 00:16:31,171
Jenn, do you have something to say?

229
00:16:31,255 --> 00:16:32,881
- Oh, yeah. I'm so sorry.

230
00:16:32,965 --> 00:16:36,134
You know, you're new and I totally 
took advantage of the situation.

231
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:38,512
I shouldn't do that.
I'm so sorry.

232
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:41,181
This really wasn't covered
in my orientation.

233
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:43,767
- Well, we may not be a normal family ―
- You think?

234
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:45,686
but we do have to 
operate as a team.

235
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,521
We have a huge
opportunity here.

236
00:16:47,605 --> 00:16:49,898
I'd like to see us
keep our focus.

237
00:16:49,982 --> 00:16:53,276
- Our first review is in 30 days.
- Gotta sell, sell, sell.

238
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:57,030
- All right. Can I get a 
ride with you? │- Bite me.

239
00:16:57,156 --> 00:16:59,533
- Kate, this is why I need a car.
- I don't wanna hear it.

240
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:01,076
Mick, wait.

241
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,078
I'm gonna be late
for my hot yoga class.

242
00:17:03,162 --> 00:17:06,164
- Oh, you know, sure. That's really ―
- Have a nice day.

243
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,501
You have a nice day too.

244
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:30,772

00:20:10,683 --> 00:20:12,350
All right, then.

269
00:20:12,435 --> 00:20:15,604
I'm sure you're all eager
to hear your results ...

270
00:20:15,688 --> 00:20:17,981
from our first month of sales.

271
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,610
Let's start with Steve.

272
00:20:21,694 --> 00:20:24,154
Total sales in this first month ...

273
00:20:24,238 --> 00:20:26,406
up three and a half percent.

274
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,408
Boo-yah!

275
00:20:28,492 --> 00:20:31,161
- All right.
- Here are a few highlights.

276
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:34,789
Sporting goods, 4% increase.

277
00:20:34,874 --> 00:20:38,001
Watches, up 2%.

278
00:20:38,085 --> 00:20:41,963
Golf-related merchandise, 3%.

279
00:20:42,048 --> 00:20:45,634
- Nice.
- Okay, Mick ― Overall sales up 16%.

280
00:20:45,718 --> 00:20:46,885
Yes.

281
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:49,304
Video games, up 13.

282
00:20:49,388 --> 00:20:51,181
Whoa.

283
00:20:51,265 --> 00:20:54,559
- Sportswear is up 21.
- Cool.

284
00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:56,603
Excellent. Way to open 
up the market, Mick.

285
00:20:56,687 --> 00:20:58,313
Good work.

286
00:20:58,397 --> 00:21:01,733
And Jenn ― Up 14% overall.

287
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:04,694
- Solid work, my dear.
- You did good.

288
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,572
- Hey, you're still two down.
- Kate ―

289
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:12,410
- Congratulations on being our 
top producer. │- Thank you.

290
00:21:12,495 --> 00:21:14,704
Up 20%.

291
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:16,539
Wow. Okay.

292
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:20,502
Wow. Thank you. Thank you.

293
00:21:20,586 --> 00:21:22,295
Cosmetics, up 24.

294
00:21:27,051 --> 00:21:28,969
Great form.

295
00:21:29,053 --> 00:21:31,262
Thank you.

296
00:21:34,725 --> 00:21:36,768
Are you focused?

297
00:21:36,852 --> 00:21:38,645
Am I focused?
Yeah, I'm focused.

298
00:21:38,729 --> 00:21:40,605
You know, you were
a great car salesman.

299
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,441
People trusted you
and they liked you,

300
00:21:43,526 --> 00:21:45,485
so they bought what 
you were selling.

301
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:47,988
But you're not selling 
things anymore.

302
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:51,241
To succeed here, you 
can't just sell things.

303
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:55,662
You're here to sell a 
lifestyle, an attitude.

304
00:21:55,788 --> 00:21:57,998
- Right.
- If people want you,

305
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,418
they'll want what you've got.

306
00:22:08,843 --> 00:22:12,303
Um, do the clients know
how this works?

307
00:22:12,388 --> 00:22:15,849
Of course not. That's why it's 
called "stealth marketing."

308
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:17,559
The fact is, we get results.

309
00:22:17,643 --> 00:22:19,936
How we go about that
is our business.

310
00:22:21,105 --> 00:22:23,189
The question you have
to ask yourself is ―

311
00:22:23,274 --> 00:22:27,569
How far are you willing
to go to get what you want?

312
00:22:27,653 --> 00:22:29,654
It's called killer instinct.

313
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:31,698
If you can find it,

314
00:22:31,782 --> 00:22:34,325
you could have anything you want.

315
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,785
Anything.

316
00:22:43,586 --> 00:22:45,086
Thanks.

317
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:50,008
I don't think he's got it.
I think we may have to bag him.

318
00:22:50,092 --> 00:22:51,593
No, no. I ―

319
00:22:51,677 --> 00:22:54,637
I know he's green.
He just needs some time.

320
00:22:54,722 --> 00:22:57,474
And-And I ... I can deal with this.

321
00:22:57,558 --> 00:22:59,809
I warned you not to pick a rookie ...

322
00:22:59,894 --> 00:23:01,853
in your first "head of household."

323
00:23:01,937 --> 00:23:05,148
You've known me a long 
time. I can handle this.

324
00:23:07,318 --> 00:23:09,486
I'll give you 60 days.

325
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,655
But this is your ass
on the line, not mine.

326
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,075
Thank you.

327
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:17,368
Thank you. You won't regret it.

328
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:19,871
We'll see, won't we?

329
00:23:24,668 --> 00:23:26,711
We're in a terrible
situation right now.

330
00:23:26,796 --> 00:23:27,962
Why are you talking
about spending?

331
00:23:28,047 --> 00:23:29,631
Have you read my new book?

332
00:23:29,757 --> 00:23:32,258
- I have, and I disagree with 
you completely. │- Oh, okay.

333
00:23:32,343 --> 00:23:35,095
Looks like sales for luxury items have
been up for the last two months.

334
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:36,596
You think we're
in a bull market?

335
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,264
That's what I said.
Spend, spend, spend.

336
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:39,599
Bull market's
around the corner.

337
00:23:39,683 --> 00:23:41,309
I understand that bulls are bad.

338
00:23:41,393 --> 00:23:43,770
Anyone can see how upside-down
the entire market is.

339
00:23:43,854 --> 00:23:45,396
Foreclosures at an all-time high ―

340
00:23:45,481 --> 00:23:47,524
That's true. About four million
foreclosed homes this year.

341
00:23:47,608 --> 00:23:49,651
The dollar is on its way up.
I'm telling you.

342
00:23:49,735 --> 00:23:51,653
If you want to spend your way out,

343
00:23:51,737 --> 00:23:53,863
the dollar will end up
the same way as the peso.

344
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,539
- Hey.
- Hey.

345
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:09,671
So we need to step it up, so I've 
decided that we're gonna throw a party.

346
00:24:09,755 --> 00:24:13,299
Jesus. Look at Larry.
He is a miserable bastard.

347
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:15,969
My guess is they sleep
in separate bedrooms.

348
00:24:16,053 --> 00:24:17,554
Yeah, I know how that feels.

349
00:24:17,638 --> 00:24:21,015
This is serious, and I'd 
really like you to focus.

350
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,101
- Okay?
- Hmm?

351
00:24:23,185 --> 00:24:25,979
I mean, we really need
to pull out all the stops.

352
00:24:26,063 --> 00:24:28,314
I'd like to put our 
contact list to good use ...

353
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:30,358
and start to showcase
all we've got.

354
00:24:30,442 --> 00:24:33,027
It's a good time for me 
to wear the YSL dress.

355
00:24:33,112 --> 00:24:35,405
I'd really like to roll out
the Van Cleef earrings.

356
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:37,574
I think you have some of 
those Costume National that ―

357
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,534
- Oh, ho, ho, ho.
have a chance to ―

358
00:24:39,618 --> 00:24:41,369
Thank you.

359
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,331
I really have some 
things that I'd like ...

360
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:47,750
to ... to talk to you ―

361
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:51,337
S-So I ... There's some 
things that I want ―

362
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:56,176
- Hey, Larry.
- Come on. Come on.

363
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,677
- Hey.
- Hey.

364
00:24:57,803 --> 00:25:00,805
- I'm on poop patrol here.
- Nice. Mind if I ask you a question?

365
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,807
Hmm?

366
00:25:02,892 --> 00:25:05,351
Think Kate'll like these?

367
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:10,648
- Cha-cha, bling.
- Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

368
00:25:10,774 --> 00:25:13,568
- What's the occasion?
- No occasion.

369
00:25:14,904 --> 00:25:17,614
- Oh, geez. Summer would love those.
- Yeah.

370
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,366
- Well, business is good, isn't it?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

371
00:25:20,492 --> 00:25:23,786
- Terrific. Absolutely.
- This is what it's all about.

372
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:25,914
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

373
00:25:25,998 --> 00:25:28,917
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. You, uh ... 
Are you gonna play today?

374
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:30,835
Oh, uh, no.

375
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,338
You know, I pulled ―
I kinda pulled a muscle.

376
00:25:33,464 --> 00:25:35,006
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

377
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,425
Kate and I are into this 
new tantric sex thing.

378
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:39,844
I don't know how I got in the ―

379
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:41,512
But it, you know ―

380
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:43,139
- It went too far.
- Yeah.

381
00:25:45,184 --> 00:25:47,227
Well, l, uh ―

382
00:25:47,353 --> 00:25:50,230
- I sure haven't pulled any 
muscles lately. │- No?

383
00:25:50,314 --> 00:25:53,066
You know how I keep it fresh
between Kate and me?

384
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,777
Uh, good listening?

385
00:25:55,861 --> 00:25:57,946
No. No, no.

386
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,198
It's about me never really 
believing that I have her.

387
00:26:00,282 --> 00:26:03,534
Being full of surprises ...
and a steady stream of gifts.

388
00:26:20,344 --> 00:26:22,595
- It's great to see you.
- Hi. How are you?

389
00:26:24,473 --> 00:26:26,099
- Have you tried this yet?
- Yes, and ―

390
00:26:26,183 --> 00:26:28,184
I think you're gonna love it.

391
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:30,937
- How are you ladies?
- Are you enjoying that Pomtini?

392
00:26:31,021 --> 00:26:33,231
It's good, yeah?

393
00:26:33,315 --> 00:26:36,526
Well, we'll just, uh, make 
sure we'll keep 'em coming.

394
00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:42,657
This vodka is either ― It's either 
from Mexico or Antarctica.

395
00:26:42,783 --> 00:26:45,535
- How are you guys doing?
- Hi. │- Hey.

396
00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:47,787
Oh, those earrings are gorgeous.

397
00:26:47,871 --> 00:26:49,664
Thank you. Steve surprised me.

398
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:52,292
- What was the occasion?
- It was a Tuesday gift.

399
00:26:52,418 --> 00:26:54,752
Tuesday? What's a Tuesday gift?

400
00:26:55,838 --> 00:26:58,131
Just for being Tuesday.

401
00:26:58,215 --> 00:27:00,216
- Oh, my.
- That's so romantic.

402
00:27:00,342 --> 00:27:03,052
Makes me want a cannelloni.

403
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:06,180
- These are delicious.
- You like 'em?

404
00:27:06,307 --> 00:27:08,182
- Mm-hmm.
- Who does your catering?

405
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:10,184
Chef Robert.

406
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:11,686
- No.
- Really?

407
00:27:12,813 --> 00:27:15,440
Excuse me. Will you show that?

408
00:27:17,776 --> 00:27:20,236
- I didn't know he was doing frozen 
food. │- Can you believe it?

409
00:27:20,362 --> 00:27:24,198
- Ooh. │- You know, we had the most
incredible chicken "fricazini,"

410
00:27:24,283 --> 00:27:26,117
homemade, at the 
Robustion spring gala ―

411
00:27:26,201 --> 00:27:27,994
Oh, I've got to try the sushi.

412
00:27:28,078 --> 00:27:31,748
Ohh! Now, this is one thing
you won't find in your freezer.

413
00:27:31,832 --> 00:27:34,250
Oh, yes, it is.

414
00:27:36,628 --> 00:27:41,174
Wataru flash-frozen sushi.

415
00:27:41,258 --> 00:27:45,428
This is the view from base camp.

416
00:27:45,512 --> 00:27:47,597
I can't believe you 
actually climbed Everest.

417
00:27:47,681 --> 00:27:49,349
The Sherpas are the key, you know.

418
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:52,310
You don't wanna do it
without the Sherpas.

419
00:27:52,394 --> 00:27:53,811
Man, this system's great.

420
00:27:53,896 --> 00:27:55,396
Yeah, with the bundle of services,

421
00:27:55,481 --> 00:27:56,981
you get the clearest HD picture.

422
00:27:57,066 --> 00:27:58,983
All your personal media
is just a click away.

423
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:00,860
You can see it ― 
What are you boys up to?

424
00:28:00,944 --> 00:28:02,862
... best HD picture.

425
00:28:02,946 --> 00:28:05,031
Are you showing off your new toy?

426
00:28:05,115 --> 00:28:07,241
Guilty. Yeah.

427
00:28:11,997 --> 00:28:15,083
And ... who's your favorite toy?

428
00:28:16,752 --> 00:28:18,336
You are.

429
00:28:19,338 --> 00:28:21,339
Mm-hmm.

430
00:28:25,969 --> 00:28:27,970
All right, can I get 
you guys another ―

431
00:28:28,055 --> 00:28:30,223
No, no. I'm good.
It's a little hot in here.

432
00:28:30,307 --> 00:28:31,974
Thank you.

433
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:34,143
- Maybe a big boy drink?
- No, I'm good, thank you.

434
00:28:34,228 --> 00:28:37,146
- Do you want something?
- Um, I'm ― I'm ―

435
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:38,940
Nice.

436
00:28:42,861 --> 00:28:44,153
Where were we?

437
00:28:44,238 --> 00:28:46,239
Watch for the guy on 
the top right now.

438
00:28:46,323 --> 00:28:47,865
All right. Shoot him.
Shoot him now.

439
00:28:49,076 --> 00:28:50,827
- Oh, awesome!
- Told you this was easy.

440
00:28:56,708 --> 00:28:59,961
What kind of shit did your parents 
do to get you that thing?

441
00:29:00,045 --> 00:29:03,256
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, I know a guilt gift when I see one,

442
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,591
and that one's got "I'm sorry 
for being a fucked-up parent" ...

443
00:29:05,676 --> 00:29:07,593
written all over it.

444
00:29:07,678 --> 00:29:10,555
Yeah, I guess so.

445
00:29:10,681 --> 00:29:12,223
- I'm Naomi.
- Mick.

446
00:29:12,307 --> 00:29:13,683
- I know.
- Hmm?

447
00:29:13,767 --> 00:29:15,476
You have this whole cult 
following at school.

448
00:29:15,602 --> 00:29:17,812
- I do? │-Yeah. You've been 
there, what, two months?

449
00:29:17,896 --> 00:29:19,605
Everyone's drinking your Kool-Aid.

450
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:24,694
So, why are you here?
You a friend of Jenn's?

451
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:27,405
Yeah, right. Yeah. Can't you 
see me with that crowd?

452
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:29,657
Mmm.

453
00:29:29,783 --> 00:29:31,784
- Nah. 
- No, not really.

454
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,036
- I'm here with my parents.
- Mmm.

455
00:29:36,206 --> 00:29:38,708
Wanna get high?

456
00:29:40,252 --> 00:29:42,253
Sure. Yeah.

457
00:29:46,592 --> 00:29:48,551
- Wow.
- Oh, yeah.

458
00:29:48,635 --> 00:29:51,554
Well, it must be really big
to be called "the hammer."

459
00:29:51,638 --> 00:29:54,474
Well, yeah. I'd love 
to show it to you.

460
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:56,350
Really?

461
00:29:56,435 --> 00:29:59,937
Yeah. You'll have to stop 
by the marina one day ―

462
00:30:00,063 --> 00:30:03,107
soon.
- I would love to.

463
00:30:03,192 --> 00:30:05,109
That'd be great.

464
00:30:05,194 --> 00:30:08,571
Yeah. You know what?
I'm gonna have to go.

465
00:30:08,655 --> 00:30:11,407
Well, it was nice
meeting you, Mr. Bayner.

466
00:30:11,492 --> 00:30:13,409
You too. Bye, now.

467
00:30:14,995 --> 00:30:18,331
Oh, there you are, sweetheart.
How's it going? You have a good time?

468
00:30:18,415 --> 00:30:19,790
And her hair was not ―

469
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,253
Yeah.

470
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,468
- What are you doing?
- Mingling.

471
00:30:31,845 --> 00:30:35,348
Maybe you might wanna go and 
show the girls your room.

472
00:30:35,432 --> 00:30:36,933
Yay.

473
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:40,728
How are you guys doing?

474
00:30:40,812 --> 00:30:42,605
This sushi is incredible.

475
00:30:42,731 --> 00:30:45,107
You guys are so wonderful.
Nobody throws a party like you do.

476
00:30:45,234 --> 00:30:47,818
Well, we'll have to do it again.

477
00:30:47,903 --> 00:30:50,571
- Troublemaker.
- Hey, look who's here.

478
00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:53,324
You know who this is.
The lady of the evening.

479
00:30:53,408 --> 00:30:55,368
- Hey, Naomi?
- Mm-hmm.

480
00:30:55,452 --> 00:30:58,412
Do you wanna know why all those 
people are in my house right now?

481
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:01,999
- It's a party. Duh.
- Yeah.

482
00:31:02,084 --> 00:31:05,836
No, it's so my so-called "family" ...

483
00:31:05,921 --> 00:31:08,422
can show off all their shit.

484
00:31:08,507 --> 00:31:11,509
And you know all those people ...

485
00:31:11,593 --> 00:31:14,720
are fucking blown away by it all.

486
00:31:14,805 --> 00:31:16,722
Yeah.

487
00:31:16,807 --> 00:31:19,600
That sounds like something
my parents would do.

488
00:31:22,229 --> 00:31:25,481
- Aren't you two the sexy couple?
- Oh.

489
00:31:25,566 --> 00:31:28,109
Don't forget about lunch next week.

490
00:31:28,193 --> 00:31:30,653
Good night.

491
00:31:31,738 --> 00:31:33,614
Um ― l, uh ―

492
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,701
- I think it went ― went great ... 
tonight. │- Uh-huh. Yeah.

493
00:31:36,785 --> 00:31:40,329
I mean, I personally didn't feel 
like l, uh, connected with Melanie.

494
00:31:40,414 --> 00:31:42,832
I don't know if you ― Did you 
speak with her husband, Alex?

495
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:45,751
Don't ― Don't ― Slow down. Slow 
down. It was fine. It was perfect.

496
00:31:45,836 --> 00:31:51,507
You were perfect. You ― You know, you 
don't realize the effect you have on people.

497
00:31:52,718 --> 00:31:54,719
Thank you.

498
00:31:54,845 --> 00:31:58,848
- Um, just, uh, doing my job.
- Yeah.

499
00:32:00,517 --> 00:32:02,977
You might want to lay off the 
Robert hors d'oeuvres though.

500
00:32:03,103 --> 00:32:07,481
- Why? What do you mean?
- Oh, God. Loaded in garlic.

501
00:32:07,608 --> 00:32:10,318
- Are you kidding? Really?
- No, not kidding. No, no, no.

502
00:32:10,444 --> 00:32:12,695
- Oh, my God.
- Good night.

503
00:32:18,577 --> 00:32:20,536
Some party tonight, huh?

504
00:32:20,621 --> 00:32:22,538
Oh, my God.

505
00:32:22,623 --> 00:32:26,250
That house. I could die
for that dining set.

506
00:32:28,503 --> 00:32:30,421
Think she'll buy any 
of your products?

507
00:32:30,505 --> 00:32:32,423
They seem to buy
everything else.

508
00:32:32,507 --> 00:32:36,761
I think I can make her if I ... 
concentrate on it hard enough.

509
00:32:42,392 --> 00:32:44,977
You look really beautiful tonight.

510
00:32:45,062 --> 00:32:46,979
Honey,

511
00:32:47,064 --> 00:32:50,775
you know that my inspirations need to 
be my last thoughts before I go to sleep.

512
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:52,943
This is how I get what I want.

513
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:01,285
You should really try it sometime.

514
00:33:09,336 --> 00:33:13,089
I think it could 
really help you, Larry.

515
00:33:32,734 --> 00:33:34,360
Shh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

516
00:34:00,262 --> 00:34:02,179
- Hey.
- Mind if I join you?

517
00:34:02,264 --> 00:34:04,181
Sure, come on.

518
00:34:05,183 --> 00:34:07,059
- Want some burrito?
- Ah.

519
00:34:07,185 --> 00:34:09,854
- Chef Robert. │- No, thank you. 
I ― I ate something earlier.

520
00:34:09,938 --> 00:34:12,231
- Yeah? │- What did you have?
- A protein bar.

521
00:34:12,357 --> 00:34:13,691
- A protein bar?
- Yeah.

522
00:34:13,775 --> 00:34:15,192
Mmm, tasty.

523
00:34:15,277 --> 00:34:17,737
So I was just looking at 
the numbers since the party.

524
00:34:17,821 --> 00:34:19,697
- And you're-you're really 
improving. │- Great.

525
00:34:19,781 --> 00:34:23,743
I thought maybe we could talk about 
ways that you could do even better.

526
00:34:23,827 --> 00:34:25,786
- Mmm. 
- Kate, come on. It's our day off.

527
00:34:25,871 --> 00:34:27,580
I thought maybe we 
wouldn't talk shop.

528
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:29,582
But this is really important.

529
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:32,501
I mean, you're still selling to indi-
viduals and what you want to create ...

530
00:34:32,627 --> 00:34:36,005
is a ripple effect where you get other people 
selling for you. │- You should maybe relax.

531
00:34:36,089 --> 00:34:37,965
Is there anything you 
like to do to relax?

532
00:34:38,091 --> 00:34:41,594
- Like go shopping or watch some football 
or get a massage? │- There's always people ...

533
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,971
who others look to for advice ―
- You like massages, don't you?

534
00:34:44,055 --> 00:34:45,973
or the inside scoop.

535
00:34:46,057 --> 00:34:49,602
And then they become the connectors 
that reach the consumer on your behalf.

536
00:34:49,686 --> 00:34:52,146
Do you know what I mean?

537
00:34:52,272 --> 00:34:54,523
What?

538
00:34:54,608 --> 00:34:58,110
I just thought we'd have a normal 
conversation like normal people today.

539
00:34:58,195 --> 00:35:00,154
I don't know if you
understand the pressure.

540
00:35:00,238 --> 00:35:03,741
I mean, you know, this isn't 
about me selling my products.

541
00:35:03,825 --> 00:35:06,744
I have to ensure that my unit 
is selling their products.

542
00:35:06,828 --> 00:35:09,497
You have a unit?

543
00:35:13,126 --> 00:35:16,629
That explains why we're in 
separate bedrooms perhaps.

544
00:35:19,508 --> 00:35:24,428
You're not a great salesman. You're 
a charismatic guy and that's great.

545
00:35:24,513 --> 00:35:28,432
But if you don't apply yourself, 
then that's all you're gonna be.

546
00:35:28,558 --> 00:35:31,894
- So this is just business, huh?
- Yeah, this is business.

547
00:35:31,978 --> 00:35:34,855
And I'm your boss. I don't ―
I don't need to be friends.

548
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,149
Oh. Okay. Boss.

549
00:35:37,234 --> 00:35:42,363
Ripple effect. 
Connectors. Unit. I got it.

550
00:35:42,489 --> 00:35:44,740
- Glad we could talk.
- Great.

551
00:35:59,464 --> 00:36:02,675
Yeah, Bill Johnson said
you turned him on to these.

552
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:05,261
Can't stop talking about how
great the polarized lenses are.

553
00:36:05,387 --> 00:36:07,596
- Yeah, those are sweet.
- I know you'll love 'em.

554
00:36:07,722 --> 00:36:10,266
- Thanks. Put them on my account.
- Great. No problem, gentlemen.

555
00:36:12,352 --> 00:36:14,395
I think I'm gonna get some too.

556
00:36:18,316 --> 00:36:21,151
- Anything I can help you with, Mr. Jones?
- I'd like to book a lesson.

557
00:36:21,236 --> 00:36:23,571
Sure. No problem.

558
00:36:23,655 --> 00:36:26,991
Let's see. I can get you in
on Thursday with Bob Senior.

559
00:36:27,075 --> 00:36:30,202
No, no, no. I would like to 
book a lesson with you, Will.

560
00:36:30,287 --> 00:36:32,329
- Really?
- Mm-hmm. You teach, don't you?

561
00:36:32,414 --> 00:36:33,998
Well, yeah, mostly to kids.

562
00:36:34,082 --> 00:36:36,625
I saw you out there the other 
day. You got a sweet swing.

563
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,921
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

564
00:36:41,006 --> 00:36:42,882
Sorry.

565
00:36:43,008 --> 00:36:45,009
- How was your day today?
- Fine.

566
00:36:45,135 --> 00:36:47,052
- How was yours?
- Good.

567
00:36:47,137 --> 00:36:50,890
You know, I wanted to talk to 
you, uh, about our conversation.

568
00:36:50,974 --> 00:36:53,601
Oh, forget about it.
Business is business.

569
00:37:02,652 --> 00:37:05,946
Okay, nice. A little more weight
on your back foot there.

570
00:37:06,072 --> 00:37:07,990
- Back foot?
- Yeah.

571
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,953
Nice.

572
00:37:13,038 --> 00:37:17,833
Will, I do believe you just
added 40 yards to my drive.

573
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:20,169
You're a magician.
Let me see that driver.

574
00:37:21,671 --> 00:37:25,049
Will, thanks for pairing me up
with those guys today.

575
00:37:25,175 --> 00:37:27,843
- Hey, no problem, Mr. Jones.
- Who am I playing with tomorrow?

576
00:37:27,969 --> 00:37:30,888
- Don't worry. I got a great threesome 
lined up for you. │- You the man.

577
00:37:31,014 --> 00:37:34,808
- Cool shirt, by the way.
- Oh, thank you. Under Armour.

578
00:37:34,893 --> 00:37:36,810
If you're looking for drivers,
these are the best.

579
00:37:36,895 --> 00:37:40,356
I was on the course today, and 
Mr. Jones drove a 320. It was awesome.

580
00:37:44,694 --> 00:37:48,447
Whoa, nice shot, Charlie.
I wish I could take credit.

581
00:37:48,531 --> 00:37:51,033
The kid in the clubhouse turned 
me on to those new Mizunos.

582
00:37:51,117 --> 00:37:53,160
That kid's got the 
scoop on everything.

583
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:08,634
- Tennis, huh? │- Yeah, doubles 
with Melanie and the girls.

584
00:38:08,718 --> 00:38:12,221
- Cute outfit.
- Your numbers are looking good.

585
00:38:12,305 --> 00:38:13,514
Thanks, boss.

586
00:38:16,518 --> 00:38:19,061
- Great, Steve.
- Thanks. Don't mention it.

587
00:38:19,145 --> 00:38:21,313
Hand rolled from Cuban seeds.

588
00:38:21,398 --> 00:38:23,357
Hey, you want to join 
us for drinks later?

589
00:38:23,441 --> 00:38:26,652
Uh, what, are you kidding?
First round's on me, boys.

590
00:38:26,736 --> 00:38:28,696
Nice watch.

591
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,699
Hey, whoever dies with 
the most toys wins.

592
00:38:34,285 --> 00:38:38,956
No, don't be silly. Let me ―
Let me help you with this.

593
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,166
Well, I'll invite
some friends over,

594
00:38:41,251 --> 00:38:44,461
and then you can bring whatever 
mask over that you'd like to try.

595
00:38:44,546 --> 00:38:48,424
We're gonna absolutely help you get some 
new customers, and we'll have a nice time.

596
00:38:48,508 --> 00:38:51,802
All right, Summer. No problem.

597
00:38:51,886 --> 00:38:54,096
Yes.

598
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,515
Doesn't it feel wonderful?

599
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:58,726
It's the Robustion
"Replenishingister" Mask,

600
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:01,478
and it's got ginkgo
and wasabi extract.

601
00:39:01,563 --> 00:39:04,648
This house is gorgeous.
Can you get over the furniture?

602
00:39:04,774 --> 00:39:07,651
- More champagne, ladies?
- It's all the latest Ethan Allen.

603
00:39:07,736 --> 00:39:09,695
He's got fabulous things.

604
00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:13,574
I know because I was just at the design 
center myself yesterday looking at new things.

605
00:39:13,658 --> 00:39:16,744
Ladies, I just came 
from the washroom,

606
00:39:16,828 --> 00:39:19,455
and the toilet seat 
raised up and waved to me.

607
00:39:19,539 --> 00:39:21,165
- Well!
- Whoo!

608
00:39:21,249 --> 00:39:23,500
Well, I hope that you 
introduced yourself.

609
00:39:23,585 --> 00:39:25,294
Huh?

610
00:39:25,378 --> 00:39:29,048
- To Toto, my Tokyo toilet.
- Toto?

611
00:39:29,132 --> 00:39:31,800
Well, if that's Toto, then 
just call me the Wizard.

612
00:39:31,885 --> 00:39:35,679
'Cause it gave me a power wash to my 
undercarriage, and a happy-ending blow-dry.

613
00:39:35,764 --> 00:39:39,933
Whoo-hoo!

614
00:39:40,018 --> 00:39:43,312
And let me just say,
with a friend like Toto,

615
00:39:43,396 --> 00:39:46,065
that you are never lonely.

616
00:39:46,149 --> 00:39:49,026
Where is that fabulous
husband of yours?

617
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,987
Ah, golfing, where else?

618
00:39:52,113 --> 00:39:54,031
- A man's work is never done, huh?
- Never.

619
00:39:54,115 --> 00:39:56,241
Honey, I am home.

620
00:39:56,367 --> 00:39:58,827
- Speak of the devil.
- I missed you today.

621
00:40:01,873 --> 00:40:03,999
Well, hello.

622
00:40:06,586 --> 00:40:09,421
- Oh.
- Hmm.

623
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:20,557
Good afternoon, ladies.

624
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:28,357
- My, my.
- That's what I'm talking about.

625
00:40:32,362 --> 00:40:34,863
So, what was that?

626
00:40:36,366 --> 00:40:39,034
Just applying myself.

627
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,286
Don't tell me the ladies
weren't impressed.

629

Hey, Jones. Terry was 
totally checking you out.

630
00:41:31,171 --> 00:41:32,796
Him? Please.

631
00:41:32,922 --> 00:41:35,007
- What's wrong with him?
- Yeah, he's hot.

632
00:41:35,091 --> 00:41:37,050
- I date men.
- Excuse me?

633
00:41:41,598 --> 00:41:44,433
- Who's "The Hammer"?
- What?

634
00:41:44,517 --> 00:41:46,977
You guys are gonna have 
to go on without me.

635
00:41:47,103 --> 00:41:50,564
- No way. What are you doing?
- I'm gonna go see a friend.

636
00:41:51,608 --> 00:41:53,483
Is he cute?

637
00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:56,695
Don't get kidnapped.

they'd be interested in?

Oh, well, we're so excited.
We're going on safari in Kenya.

Yeah, yeah.
It's this amazing outfit.

Spaulding and Kent Tours.
They do everything for you.

Steve? Steve Cerrilla.

680
00:44:04,198 --> 00:44:06,867
It is you. I couldn't believe it.
I just saw you from over there.

681
00:44:06,951 --> 00:44:09,494
How are you doing?
Where you been, man?

682
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:11,747
I'm an old friend of Steve's.
My name is Henry.

683
00:44:11,873 --> 00:44:13,749
- Cerrilla? Where you been?
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

684
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:16,626
Excuse me, but I ― I think you're
sitting in my wife's seat.

685
00:44:16,711 --> 00:44:19,671
Wife? This guy was the biggest 
stud in Scottsdale, Arizona.

686
00:44:19,756 --> 00:44:22,924
- Excuse me, this is my seat.
- Oh, you're serious?

687
00:44:23,009 --> 00:44:25,177
Oh, my goodness.
I ― I  This is ―

688
00:44:25,261 --> 00:44:27,304
You finally tamed the savage 
beast, huh? Unbelievable. Come here.

689
00:44:27,388 --> 00:44:29,264
- I'm sorry.
- I am so happy for you.

690
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:32,225
You know, l, uh ― I'm Henry. 
I'm an old friend of Steve's.

691
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:35,604
I wish that I knew you, but I think you've 
got me mistaken with somebody else.

692
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:38,231
- I think you've made a mistake.
- I don't think ― Are you ―

693
00:44:38,316 --> 00:44:40,067
- I'm not that guy.
- What?

694
00:44:40,151 --> 00:44:42,319
Could you please come with me, sir?
A breath of fresh air.

695
00:44:42,403 --> 00:44:44,321
- I don't need air.
- Walk this way.

696
00:44:44,405 --> 00:44:46,448
What are you talking about?

697
00:44:46,532 --> 00:44:49,826
I don't get it.
That's not cool, dude.

698
00:44:49,911 --> 00:44:52,162
I am terribly, terribly sorry.

699
00:44:52,246 --> 00:44:56,124
- Please enjoy your dinner.
- Whoa.

700
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,585
- That was odd.
- That was weird.

701
00:44:58,669 --> 00:45:01,588
That is like the third time
since we've been here ...

702
00:45:01,672 --> 00:45:04,633
that somebody's mistaken you
for this Steve Cer ―

703
00:45:04,717 --> 00:45:07,177
- Has it been three times?
- Yes.

704
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:10,055
- I get mistaken for someone 
a lot, but ― │- Really?

705
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:13,183
it's usually Tiger Woods.

706
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:16,561
- Anyway ― │ - Do you have some 
kind of secret life going on?

707
00:45:16,687 --> 00:45:19,398
Baby, you bet I do.

708
00:45:19,482 --> 00:45:23,151
- To secret lives.
- To secret lives.

709
00:45:23,236 --> 00:45:25,487
Cheers.

710
00:45:36,499 --> 00:45:40,127
- You look like you could use a drink.
- Thank you.

711
00:45:42,797 --> 00:45:46,508
I think the kids must 
be working late.

712
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:52,305
You know, Jenn, I ― I don't know
if she's taking my advice,

713
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:56,309
but I ― I actually think that
she's starting to get it.

714
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:02,607
Oh, you smell great.

715
00:46:02,692 --> 00:46:04,568
It's L'Artisan.

716
00:46:04,694 --> 00:46:06,361
- Oh, yes.
- You like that, baby?

717
00:46:08,322 --> 00:46:11,783
Here you go,
super-stud of Scottsdale.

718
00:46:11,868 --> 00:46:15,370
Well, it's not as big of an 
achievement as it sounds.

719
00:46:15,455 --> 00:46:18,999
It was more of a 
retirement community.

720
00:46:23,921 --> 00:46:26,089
You know the great 
thing about this job?

721
00:46:26,174 --> 00:46:28,091
What?

722
00:46:28,176 --> 00:46:31,094
You get to be whoever 
you want to be.

723
00:46:31,179 --> 00:46:36,433
Yeah? But I'm not
Steve Jones, you know.

724
00:46:36,517 --> 00:46:40,312
I'm a single, 45-year-old,

725
00:46:40,396 --> 00:46:43,064

726
00:46:43,149 --> 00:46:45,984
pretending to be someone I'm not.

727
00:46:49,363 --> 00:46:52,073
I know who you are.

728
00:46:58,206 --> 00:47:00,540
Stop.

729
00:47:00,666 --> 00:47:03,335
- What?
- We can't.

730
00:47:03,419 --> 00:47:05,754
Why not?

731
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:08,381
This part is pretend.

732
00:47:09,467 --> 00:47:12,385
- Is it?
- It has to be.

733
00:47:18,643 --> 00:47:23,772
Good night.

734
00:47:53,344 --> 00:47:55,762
What? Larry, what?

735
00:47:55,846 --> 00:47:57,847
Hey, hey, Steve.

736
00:47:59,016 --> 00:48:00,892
Look at you.

737
00:48:01,018 --> 00:48:03,895
- You're kidding. That is awesome.
- I thought I'd go with the red.

738
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,481
Just a little bit hotter than 
the gray, what do you think?

739
00:48:06,607 --> 00:48:08,483
I'm jealous.

740
00:48:08,609 --> 00:48:12,070
You look different.

741
00:48:12,196 --> 00:48:14,531
- You dog.
- Oh, yes.

742
00:48:14,657 --> 00:48:17,075
- Holler at a player, yo.
- Steady stream of gifts.

743
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:19,953
- Sweet.
- I'm taking care of the luxuries.

744
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,790
- Okay, that's great.
- I got something for you too.

745
00:48:23,916 --> 00:48:26,918
- You didn't have to do that.
- It's top of the line. Laser guide.

746
00:48:27,003 --> 00:48:29,462
No, I can't ― I can't take that.

747
00:48:29,547 --> 00:48:33,883
No, seriously, Steve. I insist. I really 
want to thank you for helping me out.

748
00:48:33,968 --> 00:48:36,595
What are friends for, right?

749
00:48:36,721 --> 00:48:39,472
- Enjoy it.
- Well, thank you.

750
00:48:39,557 --> 00:48:42,017
You bet. Take care.

751
00:48:42,143 --> 00:48:45,645
- Say hi to that wife of yours.
- All right.

752
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,442
Do you mind just looking into the 
camera and stating your name?

753
00:48:50,526 --> 00:48:52,694
Steve Cerrilla.

754
00:48:52,778 --> 00:48:55,822
So let me ask you.
Tell me about yourself.

755
00:48:55,906 --> 00:48:59,159
I ― You really came very,
uh, highly recommended,

756
00:48:59,243 --> 00:49:02,662
and your resume is very impressive.
- Thank you.

757
00:49:02,747 --> 00:49:04,914
So you would be the ―

758
00:49:04,999 --> 00:49:08,793
the one who was, uh,
playing the role with me.

759
00:49:08,878 --> 00:49:11,796
Um, yes, I would.

760
00:49:11,881 --> 00:49:14,215
Have you ever worked for a woman?

761
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,302
Well, it's something I've thought 
about a lot recently.

762
00:49:17,428 --> 00:49:20,347
- Because I have never been married ―
- I saw that.

763
00:49:20,431 --> 00:49:23,933
Either real or imaginary.

764
00:49:24,018 --> 00:49:26,728
In all seriousness,
I've ― I've thought ...

765
00:49:28,064 --> 00:49:31,232
what it might be like
to meet a woman ...

766
00:49:31,317 --> 00:49:34,319
who I would be a better person for.

767
00:49:34,403 --> 00:49:36,488
That just hasn't happened, so ―

768
00:50:02,098 --> 00:50:03,932
Hey, you know, I got an idea.

769
00:50:06,227 --> 00:50:08,353
Why don't we see a movie today?

770
00:50:08,437 --> 00:50:11,106
I don't get it.
What would we sell there?

771
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:12,982
Nothing, it's just,
you know, for fun.

772
00:50:13,067 --> 00:50:15,777
- Movie. Fun.
- Oh.

773
00:50:17,697 --> 00:50:21,241
- Yeah, well, I'm busy.
- Sorry, dude.

774
00:50:23,077 --> 00:50:24,994
It's their day off.

775
00:50:27,707 --> 00:50:30,041
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

776
00:50:32,795 --> 00:50:34,713
What were your other
12 husbands like?

777
00:50:34,797 --> 00:50:37,382
There weren't 12.

778
00:50:37,466 --> 00:50:39,509
Okay, 10. Whatever.

779
00:50:39,593 --> 00:50:41,469
Please, there were six.

780
00:50:41,554 --> 00:50:45,098
Six? Okay, Henry VIII.
What were they like?

781
00:50:45,182 --> 00:50:47,767
- I don't know. │- You don't know? 
You spend a year with a guy,

782
00:50:47,852 --> 00:50:50,478
pretending to be husband and wife 
and you don't get to know him at all?

783
00:50:50,563 --> 00:50:53,481
Well, you know, you've seen one 
Mr. Jones, you've seen 'em all.

784
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:58,570
- All right.
- You can laugh.

785
00:50:58,654 --> 00:51:03,324
All right, well, I'm gonna ... take my 
coffee down to the basement, all right?

786
00:51:03,409 --> 00:51:05,994
See you later.

787
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:09,539
- Bye.
- Have a nice day off, okay?

788
00:51:13,335 --> 00:51:16,671
- Merry Christmas, everybody.
- Merry Christmas.

789
00:51:16,756 --> 00:51:21,509
As you can see, these are the products 
our clients are pushing for the holidays.

790
00:51:21,594 --> 00:51:24,179
And it's up to you to make sure ...

791
00:51:24,263 --> 00:51:28,433
they're under every 
tree in town. Nice.

792
00:51:28,517 --> 00:51:32,061
Well, I can't, uh ― I can't 
say that I'm hating this.

793
00:51:32,146 --> 00:51:35,231
- I'm glad that you like it.
- You have excellent taste.

794
00:51:35,316 --> 00:51:37,233
- Thank you.
- Is this for me?

795
00:51:37,318 --> 00:51:40,195
No. They're for your 
girlfriend, Naomi.

796
00:51:40,279 --> 00:51:43,239
She'll be selling to her little counter-
culture friends without even knowing it.

797
00:51:43,324 --> 00:51:45,658
If she's gonna be with you,
she's gonna need some style.

798
00:51:45,785 --> 00:51:48,203
- Do I look like Elton John?
- Jenn.

799
00:51:48,287 --> 00:51:53,082
Kate tells me you don't have a boyfriend 
yet, which is unusual for you, no?

800
00:51:53,209 --> 00:51:56,544
It would be nice 
if you could have ...

801
00:51:56,629 --> 00:51:58,671
a romantic interest
by Christmas, huh?

802
00:51:58,756 --> 00:52:00,840
Working on it.

803
00:52:00,925 --> 00:52:03,593
This has been in the stores 10 days.

804
00:52:03,677 --> 00:52:08,848
"Rudy's Rum Punch."
Mmm, 17% alcohol. Ow!

805
00:52:10,267 --> 00:52:13,019
Not for you.

806
00:52:13,103 --> 00:52:17,273
- A bit lowbrow, don't you think?
- It's up to you to change that.

807
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:21,402
Uh, there's one other thing I almost 
forgot. Steve, wanna come outside?

808
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:24,531
Enjoy.

809
00:52:27,785 --> 00:52:31,830
- The all new Audi R8.
- Yeah?

810
00:52:31,914 --> 00:52:35,792
It's for you. I thought
you deserve a little bonus.

811
00:52:35,876 --> 00:52:39,546
Your numbers have shown
tremendous improvement.

812
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:42,966
Keep it up and this cell
could make icon status.

813
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:45,260
Go on. I'll bet you 
look great in it.

814
00:52:57,022 --> 00:52:59,232
Whoo.

815
00:52:59,316 --> 00:53:01,484
Hey, Mick. Check it out.

816
00:53:02,736 --> 00:53:05,238
Get in.

817
00:53:09,952 --> 00:53:12,287
Is something bothering you?

818
00:53:13,622 --> 00:53:16,124
- I don't know.
- You know, if, uh ―

819
00:53:16,208 --> 00:53:19,127
if you want to talk about something,

820
00:53:19,211 --> 00:53:23,047
anything, you know,
you can always just,

821
00:53:23,132 --> 00:53:25,550
you know, talk to 
your fake mother,

822
00:53:25,634 --> 00:53:27,135
or you can talk to me.

823
00:53:28,804 --> 00:53:30,722
This whole act, it just ― 
it gets to me.

824
00:53:30,848 --> 00:53:34,267
Who's acting?
I love this car.

825
00:53:37,271 --> 00:53:40,231
That's not what I meant.

826
00:53:40,316 --> 00:53:42,692
Just think of it this way.
We're making a match ...

827
00:53:42,776 --> 00:53:44,694
between great products and 
the people that want them.

828
00:53:44,778 --> 00:53:46,696
It's a service.

829
00:53:47,948 --> 00:53:49,866
Hey, Larry.

830
00:53:51,952 --> 00:53:54,370
♪ We at it again. 
Everybody on the dance floor ♪

831
00:53:54,455 --> 00:53:57,165
Wow.

832
00:53:57,249 --> 00:53:59,876
♪ We at it again ♪

833
00:54:00,002 --> 00:54:02,045
- Lookin' good, Steve.
- You too, player.

834
00:54:02,129 --> 00:54:04,047
♪ We at it again ♪

835
00:54:04,131 --> 00:54:06,049
♪ Everybody on the dance floor ♪

836
00:54:06,133 --> 00:54:09,302
I think you just ruined his day.

837
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:15,767
Oh, sweet.

838
00:54:15,851 --> 00:54:17,810
Sweet, indeed.

839
00:54:17,895 --> 00:54:20,605
I just wanted to remind you that we 
have dinner reservations at 8:00.

840
00:54:20,689 --> 00:54:22,982
Oh, good. That sounds good.
Want to hit a few?

841
00:54:23,108 --> 00:54:25,860
- Golf? No.
- Yeah, come on. I'll teach you.

842
00:54:25,945 --> 00:54:28,655
That's what I did before the job 
at the dealership ― I taught golf.

843
00:54:28,739 --> 00:54:30,657
Hang on to that.

844
00:54:30,741 --> 00:54:33,493
You're gonna hit some golf balls. 
Have you ever done it before?

845
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:35,536
- No. Uh ―
- Okay. Perfect.

846
00:54:35,621 --> 00:54:39,624
Your knees bend in a little bit. 
Weight on the inside of your feet.

847
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,793
- Straight back with the butt 
out a little bit. │- Butt out?

848
00:54:41,877 --> 00:54:43,836
- Very nice.
- Okay.

849
00:54:43,963 --> 00:54:46,714
- Well, the hair. I'm just ―
Okay, go ahead. │- I ― I got it.

850
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:48,716
Go.

851
00:54:52,596 --> 00:54:54,514
What does icon mean? Oh! Whoa!

852
00:54:56,350 --> 00:54:58,851
That's a no-no.
I spoke on your backswing.

853
00:54:58,936 --> 00:55:01,938
- Where did you hear that?
- KC said something about it.

854
00:55:02,022 --> 00:55:03,481
Exactly what did she say?

855
00:55:03,565 --> 00:55:06,442
She said something about making 
icon status or something like that.

856
00:55:07,528 --> 00:55:09,529
- Do you know what that means?
- No.

857
00:55:09,613 --> 00:55:12,824
It's the top tier
of the family cells.

858
00:55:12,908 --> 00:55:16,244
I mean, we'll be bringing
high-end goods to market first.

859
00:55:16,328 --> 00:55:19,914
LifeImage is gonna be
looking for our input ...

860
00:55:19,999 --> 00:55:23,084
before proceeding
with any products.

861
00:55:23,168 --> 00:55:27,630
You and me. Do you know how long that 
I have been working towards this?

862
00:55:27,756 --> 00:55:31,300
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, wow. That's ―

863
00:55:31,427 --> 00:55:33,886
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

864
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,269
Geez. I should say "icon" more often.

865
00:55:42,438 --> 00:55:44,647
I love boats. I just wanna ...

866
00:55:44,732 --> 00:55:48,067
go away with you forever.

867
00:55:48,152 --> 00:55:50,528
We could sail the Mediterranean.

868
00:55:53,449 --> 00:55:55,950
You wouldn't believe
how beautiful it is.
Mmm.

869
00:55:57,202 --> 00:55:59,287
I can imagine.

870
00:56:05,252 --> 00:56:07,628
Where are the Bayners?

871
00:56:07,713 --> 00:56:10,298
Are they ... habitually late?

872
00:56:11,592 --> 00:56:13,509
I have a confession to make.

873
00:56:13,594 --> 00:56:15,303
Um,

874
00:56:15,387 --> 00:56:17,722
I don't think they're
gonna make it tonight.

875
00:56:17,806 --> 00:56:19,932
Alex is actually
working late and ―

876
00:56:20,059 --> 00:56:22,143
- Really?
- Yeah.

877
00:56:22,227 --> 00:56:24,479
- So it's just me and you?
- Yep.

878
00:56:25,481 --> 00:56:28,816
I mean, I was thinking that, uh,

879
00:56:30,069 --> 00:56:33,279
I really wanted to treat you
and just say thank you ...

880
00:56:33,363 --> 00:56:37,492
for all your hard work
and your improvement and ―

881
00:56:37,618 --> 00:56:39,619
- But I am okay if you want to ―
- No, no.

882
00:56:39,703 --> 00:56:43,331
I will suffer through it.

883
00:56:43,415 --> 00:56:45,291
I appreciate that.

884
00:56:45,375 --> 00:56:48,586
Is ― Is this technically a date?

885
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:52,799
Well, you could say that. I mean, we are 
out in public, and people can see us.

886
00:56:52,883 --> 00:56:55,635
So would it be inappropriate
if I were to reach over ...

887
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,306
and tuck your hair behind 
your ear like that?

888
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:03,142
Would that be something that was 
acceptable on a night like this?

889
00:57:03,227 --> 00:57:06,145
I suppose that would be okay.

890
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:08,272
And what about if I told you ...

891
00:57:08,357 --> 00:57:09,941
that you look beautiful
this evening?

892
00:57:10,025 --> 00:57:11,192
Would that be ―

893
00:57:11,318 --> 00:57:13,152
- l ― l ― 
- Would that be ―

894
00:57:13,237 --> 00:57:15,655
No. I ― I would be, um ―

895
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,407
I'd be okay with that tonight.

896
00:57:18,492 --> 00:57:19,575
Okay.

897
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:22,370
And I might even ...

898
00:57:22,454 --> 00:57:25,248
go so far as to tell you that ...

899
00:57:26,416 --> 00:57:30,044
when you want to, you 
can be quite handsome ...

900
00:57:30,129 --> 00:57:33,047
and extremely charming.

901
00:57:34,299 --> 00:57:38,010
- Well, I want to.
- Okay.

902
00:57:46,436 --> 00:57:48,396
Something to drink!

903
00:57:51,567 --> 00:57:53,776
- Nice. Hey, hey!
- Hey!

904
00:57:53,861 --> 00:57:55,778
- Another round?
- Another round.

905
00:57:55,863 --> 00:57:58,114
Oh, my goodness.
We are out of control.

906
00:57:58,198 --> 00:58:00,074
This shit is good.

907
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,076
- It's delicious.
- I told you.

908
00:58:02,161 --> 00:58:04,495
I gotta pee.

909
00:58:04,621 --> 00:58:07,206
- You go pee. You'll be all right.
- Okay, I'll be back.

910
00:58:07,291 --> 00:58:09,667
We'll save your place.
We'll save your spot.

911
00:58:09,793 --> 00:58:12,378
- Hey, you want one?
- No, I'm good, man. I don't drink.

912
00:58:12,504 --> 00:58:14,797
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah. Thanks though.

913
00:58:14,882 --> 00:58:17,758
Hey, is that ―
is that your TT outside?

914
00:58:17,885 --> 00:58:21,304
- It is. │- Man, I gotta check 
that thing out, dude.

915
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,764
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

916
00:58:23,891 --> 00:58:25,766
Open her up. Let's go.

917
00:58:25,893 --> 00:58:28,019
Go, go, go!

918
00:58:28,103 --> 00:58:29,103
Whoo!

919
00:58:29,188 --> 00:58:31,355
Mick?

920
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,275
Are you serious?

921
00:58:45,454 --> 00:58:47,872
You ever get tired 
of the imaginary stuff?

922
00:58:47,956 --> 00:58:50,333
You want a real ...

923
00:58:50,459 --> 00:58:54,420
house and kids and ... husband?
- I'll have that someday.

924
00:58:54,546 --> 00:58:56,130
- Yeah?
- Sure.

925
00:58:56,256 --> 00:58:58,132
- When? │- Well, I think 
when I'm ― when I'm ready.

926
00:58:58,217 --> 00:59:02,261
As a matter of fact, I actually 
think that I am a lot like you.

927
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:05,056
How's that?

928
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:08,643
I think there's a life I was 
living that I didn't want.

929
00:59:08,727 --> 00:59:12,355
And until I can figure 
out exactly what I want,

930
00:59:12,439 --> 00:59:16,609
I think this substitute 
life is, um, is not so bad.

931
00:59:16,693 --> 00:59:19,153
I get it.

932
00:59:21,531 --> 00:59:25,159
To icon.

933
00:59:26,328 --> 00:59:27,787
Icon.

934
00:59:28,956 --> 00:59:33,084
I just like saying it. Icon. Icon.

935
00:59:33,168 --> 00:59:35,836
Icon, icon, icon.

936
00:59:37,506 --> 00:59:40,007
Does it have an effect
on you in any way?

937
00:59:44,304 --> 00:59:47,682
Yeah! Whoo!
That's it. Open it up.

938
00:59:50,018 --> 00:59:51,686
Here we go.

939
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:54,063
What'd I tell you ―
This thing's awesome!

940
00:59:55,565 --> 00:59:57,483
Go, go, go. Make this light.
Make this light.

941
01:00:11,331 --> 01:00:14,250
- My baby.
- I could get used to this, man.

942
01:00:14,376 --> 01:00:16,544
- Absolutely.
- Appreciate it.

943
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:19,463
- Yeah, no problem. │- That was 
great. You're pretty cool, Mick.

944
01:00:19,589 --> 01:00:21,590
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

945
01:00:21,675 --> 01:00:24,677
So, uh, anyone home?

946
01:00:24,761 --> 01:00:28,723
- No, my parents are out of town.
- Yeah.

947
01:00:29,975 --> 01:00:31,309
What a night, man.

948
01:00:33,061 --> 01:00:35,313
- What the hell, man?
- I'm sorry. I just thought-

949
01:00:35,397 --> 01:00:38,107
Get the fuck away from me!
You son of a fucking bitch!

950
01:00:38,233 --> 01:00:39,692
- Bitch.
- Fuck!

951
01:00:39,818 --> 01:00:41,736
- Listen, man. I didn't ―
- Fuck you!

952
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:43,946
Shut the fuck up, you faggot!

953
01:00:44,031 --> 01:00:45,531
I thought you were down for it.

954
01:00:46,575 --> 01:00:48,784
Fucking ―

955
01:01:03,633 --> 01:01:05,301
Maybe we should stay in tonight.

956
01:01:06,845 --> 01:01:08,095
This doesn't make sense.

957
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:10,598
It just keeps saying that all
of our cards are unbalanced.

958
01:01:10,682 --> 01:01:12,224
You did make the payments,
didn't you?

959
01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:14,560
I'm sure it's just a mistake.
I'll straighten it out.

960
01:01:14,644 --> 01:01:17,146
These cards are my foundation, 
Larry. I need them for the gala.

961
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:19,482
I've got stuff to pay for.
How am I supposed to do that?

962
01:01:19,608 --> 01:01:22,276
- The linens, the bartenders, the gazebo.
- All right. I'll take care of it.

963
01:01:22,361 --> 01:01:25,112
Don't worry. Don't worry.
Don't worry?

964
01:01:25,197 --> 01:01:28,157
Larry, you did not make the 
house payment last month.

965
01:01:28,241 --> 01:01:30,493
Why would you tell me that 
I don't need to worry?

966
01:01:32,496 --> 01:01:35,039
Seriously, you gotta fix this today.

967
01:01:35,123 --> 01:01:37,166
Do you understand me?

968
01:02:03,777 --> 01:02:06,946
- Mr. Jones?
- Yes.

969
01:02:08,031 --> 01:02:10,324
I'm Detective Gardner,
Third Precinct.

970
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:13,369
- I'd like to have a word with you.
- Oh. Well, okay.

971
01:02:13,453 --> 01:02:16,163
It seems like there was a 
party near here last night ...

972
01:02:16,248 --> 01:02:19,500
where some alcohol was 
being served to minors.

973
01:02:19,584 --> 01:02:23,462
Now, some of the kids said that 
your son Mick brought the alcohol.

974
01:02:23,547 --> 01:02:25,464
Oh, no, no. That's ―
That's impossible.

975
01:02:25,549 --> 01:02:27,675
Is everything all right?

976
01:02:27,759 --> 01:02:31,220
You know a young lady by 
the name of Naomi Madsen?

977
01:02:31,304 --> 01:02:33,681
Yeah, she's a friend of our son's.

978
01:02:33,765 --> 01:02:36,142
She left the party drunk
and got in a car accident.

979
01:02:36,268 --> 01:02:38,352
Oh, my God. Is she okay?

980
01:02:38,437 --> 01:02:41,021
She'll be all right.
Could have been worse.

981
01:02:41,106 --> 01:02:44,525
Right now, I'm concerned about 
where that alcohol came from.

982
01:02:44,609 --> 01:02:46,026
Is your son home?

983
01:02:46,111 --> 01:02:48,737
Uh, no. He left about 
half an hour ago.

984
01:02:48,822 --> 01:02:51,490
But I ― I could try him on his cell.

985
01:02:51,575 --> 01:02:54,243
- Please.
- Thank you, honey.

986
01:02:56,872 --> 01:02:58,789
Is that a cop?

987
01:02:58,874 --> 01:03:00,749
Yes, it is.

988
01:03:00,876 --> 01:03:03,335
- What happened to your face?
- It's nothing.

989
01:03:03,462 --> 01:03:06,881
- What's going on out there?
- We're trying to save your ass.

990
01:03:06,965 --> 01:03:09,300
So why don't you just get 
upstairs and stay out of sight?

991
01:03:09,384 --> 01:03:10,926
What?

992
01:03:13,472 --> 01:03:15,389
From father to father,

993
01:03:15,474 --> 01:03:17,766
I trust you're gonna deal with 
your son appropriately, right?

994
01:03:17,893 --> 01:03:20,644
- Ooh, I'm gonna deal with 
him appropriately. │- Okay.

995
01:03:20,729 --> 01:03:23,314
I just got his voice mail.

996
01:03:23,398 --> 01:03:27,485
But, um, he's very good about checking 
in, so I'm sure we'll hear from him.

997
01:03:27,569 --> 01:03:29,820
Just to let you know,
these cases often result ...

998
01:03:29,905 --> 01:03:32,573
in some sort of civil liability.

999
01:03:32,699 --> 01:03:35,159
- You may want to be prepared.
- Thank you for the tip.

1000
01:03:35,243 --> 01:03:36,202
- Yeah.
- Sir.

1001
01:03:36,328 --> 01:03:38,162
- Appreciate that.
- Yeah. Nice meeting you.

1002
01:03:38,246 --> 01:03:40,080
- Detective.
- Thank you.

1003
01:03:47,255 --> 01:03:50,257
What are we supposed to do now? Has 
anything like this ever happened before?

1004
01:03:50,342 --> 01:03:52,301
So what's going on?

1005
01:03:52,385 --> 01:03:54,637
Naomi Madsen's in the hospital.

1006
01:03:54,763 --> 01:03:57,306
- She got drunk and got into 
an accident. │- Is she okay?

1007
01:03:57,390 --> 01:03:59,475
It sounds like she's gonna be okay.

1008
01:03:59,559 --> 01:04:02,311
- I want all of that punch out of here 
immediately. │- Don't worry. It's gone.

1009
01:04:02,395 --> 01:04:04,021
I can't believe you 
gave it to minors.

1010
01:04:04,105 --> 01:04:08,567
- It's my job. Who do you think drinks 
that stuff? │- That's not the point.

1011
01:04:08,652 --> 01:04:10,361
Weren't you with her at the party?

1012
01:04:10,445 --> 01:04:14,031
You must have seen she couldn't 
drive. Why didn't you take her home?

1013
01:04:14,115 --> 01:04:16,742
- I didn't know she was that drunk.
- Some friend you are.

1014
01:04:16,826 --> 01:04:18,327
Shut up, Jenn.
I wasn't even there.

1015
01:04:18,453 --> 01:04:21,038
- Then where were you?
- I took a ride.

1016
01:04:21,122 --> 01:04:22,957
Oh, so you were 
driving drunk as well.

1017
01:04:23,041 --> 01:04:24,625
- No. Tim drove.
- Who's Tim?

1018
01:04:24,709 --> 01:04:28,212
- Tim.
- Isn't that Naomi's brother?

1019
01:04:28,296 --> 01:04:30,631
So you both left her? Why would 
you do something like that?

1020
01:04:30,715 --> 01:04:32,758
No, no, no.

1021
01:04:32,842 --> 01:04:34,343
I got it.

1022
01:04:34,469 --> 01:04:37,221
- You were hitting on the wrong guy ―
- Fuck you!

1023
01:04:37,305 --> 01:04:39,473
Oh, my God. I knew it.

1024
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,684
Thank you for that.

1025
01:04:43,353 --> 01:04:46,522
You know what? Screw it. I shouldn't 
have to hide this shit anymore.

1026
01:04:46,648 --> 01:04:48,315
I'm gay.

1027
01:04:50,235 --> 01:04:52,111
At least I'm not a slut.

1028
01:04:53,363 --> 01:04:56,365
So-So, what?

1029
01:04:56,449 --> 01:04:58,450
I'm sorry to spoil the 
coming-out party here, guys.

1030
01:04:58,535 --> 01:05:01,161
- I've got someplace to be.
- Where are you going?

1031
01:05:01,246 --> 01:05:03,747
No, no, no. We all need to 
get on the same page here.

1032
01:05:03,832 --> 01:05:06,584
I don't care what 
page you guys are on.

1033
01:05:06,668 --> 01:05:08,252
I'm gonna go see my boyfriend.

1034
01:05:08,336 --> 01:05:10,212
And while we're all sharing here,

1035
01:05:10,297 --> 01:05:12,089
it's Alex Bayner.

1036
01:05:12,173 --> 01:05:15,593
- Melanie's husband?
- Yeah.

1037
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:19,388
- Alex Bayner.
- This family's fucked up.

1038
01:05:19,472 --> 01:05:22,558
- Where did we go wrong?
- We're finished.

1039
01:05:22,642 --> 01:05:25,019
It's gonna get around that 
Jenn's out of control.

1040
01:05:25,145 --> 01:05:27,605
- We've got the police asking 
about Mick. │- But there's ―

1041
01:05:27,689 --> 01:05:29,273
The company doesn't tolerate
this kind of thing.

1042
01:05:29,399 --> 01:05:31,817
Hey, come on. And I am 
responsible for this unit.

1043
01:05:31,901 --> 01:05:33,444
No, we will figure
this out together.

1044
01:05:33,528 --> 01:05:36,238
There is no "we", Steve.

1045
01:05:40,827 --> 01:05:43,203
I have to go now and file a report.

1046
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:48,626
Me.

1047
01:05:48,752 --> 01:05:51,211
- It's natural that a family has 
problems. │- We're not a family.

1048
01:05:53,965 --> 01:05:55,966
A unit?

1049
01:06:24,913 --> 01:06:26,830
Knock, knock.

1050
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:30,709
Hey, sexy.

1051
01:06:30,794 --> 01:06:34,046
You hiding from me down there?

1052
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:36,131
I'm waiting.

1053
01:06:38,885 --> 01:06:40,344
Looking for someone?

1054
01:06:40,428 --> 01:06:43,138
What are you doing here?

1055
01:06:43,223 --> 01:06:45,099
It is my boat.

1056
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:55,025
- He doesn't love you.
- Oh.

1057
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:58,946
Well, aren't you something?
You poor girl.

1058
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:01,782
You actually think you're special.

1059
01:07:01,866 --> 01:07:04,702
He's met dozens of girls like you.

1060
01:07:04,786 --> 01:07:06,537
You're a plaything.

1061
01:07:06,621 --> 01:07:10,207
He's had his fun, and now it's over.

1062
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:12,251
Please.

1063
01:07:12,335 --> 01:07:14,378
Stay away from my husband.

1064
01:07:14,462 --> 01:07:17,131
He doesn't want anything
to do with you.

1065
01:07:17,215 --> 01:07:19,800
You wish.

1066
01:07:38,653 --> 01:07:40,654
I couldn't do it.

Hi, Steve.

1100
01:11:46,609 --> 01:11:48,443
KC. That's a surprise.

1101
01:11:48,528 --> 01:11:50,612
Kate didn't mention
you coming by today.

1102
01:11:50,738 --> 01:11:52,864
- I'm here to see you.
- Really?

1103
01:11:54,575 --> 01:11:55,909
Okay.

1104
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:02,416
- I've got good news.
- Yeah?

1105
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,502
Your numbers have
gone through the roof.

1106
01:12:05,586 --> 01:12:08,880
We're aware of some of
the issues in this cell,

1107
01:12:08,965 --> 01:12:11,758
and we think you could do 
better in a different cell ―

1108
01:12:11,843 --> 01:12:13,760
an icon cell.

1109
01:12:13,845 --> 01:12:17,639
Well, uh, look,
I appreciate the offer,

1110
01:12:17,724 --> 01:12:19,975
but I think this family can 
make icon status together.

1111
01:12:20,059 --> 01:12:21,309
They're holding you back.

1112
01:12:21,394 --> 01:12:24,104
You need a better 
team around you.

1113
01:12:24,188 --> 01:12:25,897
I know you like her.

1114
01:12:25,982 --> 01:12:28,942
It's her job to 
make you like her.

1115
01:12:29,027 --> 01:12:32,821
She's a businesswoman,
and she's ambitious.

1116
01:12:32,905 --> 01:12:35,198
Don't think for a minute ...

1117
01:12:35,283 --> 01:12:40,203
she wouldn't leap at this
opportunity and leave you.

1118
01:12:40,288 --> 01:12:44,166
What do you think happened
to the last husband ...

1119
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:47,794
when she got offered this job?

1120
01:12:52,508 --> 01:12:54,217
I appreciate it. I do.

1121
01:12:54,302 --> 01:12:56,386
But I think I've got
a good team around me,

1122
01:12:56,471 --> 01:13:00,640
and I'd like to try to 
make it work with them.

1123
01:13:10,735 --> 01:13:13,570
So where are you gonna go
for vacation? Really.

1124
01:13:14,781 --> 01:13:17,908
I haven't decided yet. You?

1125
01:13:18,034 --> 01:13:20,327
Kenya.

1126
01:13:20,411 --> 01:13:23,830
No. I'm gonna go to Arizona,
visit my old man.

1127
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,085
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

1128
01:13:29,128 --> 01:13:31,296
I'd like you to come with me.

1129
01:13:33,716 --> 01:13:36,218
What do you say?

1130
01:13:36,302 --> 01:13:39,096
I say let me think about it.

1131
01:13:41,182 --> 01:13:44,184
- You know what's really crazy?
- What?

1132
01:13:44,268 --> 01:13:46,269
I don't even know
your real last name.

1133
01:13:49,607 --> 01:13:54,611
Well, a girI's gotta have
her secrets, doesn't she?

1134
01:13:54,695 --> 01:13:56,696
Can I buy a vowel?

1135
01:13:57,949 --> 01:14:01,368
Hi. Hi, everyone.

1136
01:14:01,494 --> 01:14:03,829
Thank you so much 
for coming. Hi.

1137
01:14:03,913 --> 01:14:06,706
Ripple effect. Ripple.

1138
01:14:06,791 --> 01:14:08,667
Thank you. Hello. Hi.

1139
01:14:08,793 --> 01:14:10,919
- Well, come on in here.
- Oh.

1140
01:14:11,045 --> 01:14:13,839
- Ripple. Ripple.
- Look at that.

1141
01:14:13,923 --> 01:14:16,842
- Hi.
- Martini ripple at 3:00.

1142
01:14:16,926 --> 01:14:20,178
Thank you for coming
to my Robustion gala.

1143
01:14:20,263 --> 01:14:22,889
Really. Come in and sit down.

1144
01:14:22,974 --> 01:14:26,768
- Relax, 'cause I just want you all ―
- Shh.

1145
01:14:26,853 --> 01:14:29,396
to enjoy the show.

1146
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:32,232
Now, is this you?

1147
01:14:32,316 --> 01:14:37,779
Robustion lndustries is proud 
to present their new product ―

1148
01:14:37,864 --> 01:14:40,198
Robustion Trois.

1149
01:14:42,285 --> 01:14:44,202
I'd love to really give 
this my full attention,

1150
01:14:44,287 --> 01:14:46,580
but I'm gonna go see Larry
and tell him I'm gay.

1151
01:14:46,706 --> 01:14:48,415
contains all the "must haves" ―
- Larry.

1152
01:14:48,541 --> 01:14:50,959
- Larry?
- Steve. Steve.

1153
01:14:51,043 --> 01:14:53,336
- Have a drink with me.
- Bottoms up. Go ahead.

1154
01:14:53,421 --> 01:14:55,463
No, thank you.

1155
01:14:55,548 --> 01:14:58,175
... for all skin types that are 
concerned about the signs of aging.

1156
01:14:58,301 --> 01:15:00,594
- What?
- She's furious at me.

1157
01:15:00,678 --> 01:15:03,388
This moisturizing 
formula is proven ―

1158
01:15:03,472 --> 01:15:06,141
She is beautiful, though, isn't she?

1159
01:15:06,225 --> 01:15:08,518
Yeah.

1160
01:15:10,646 --> 01:15:14,357
I just, uh ― I just 
wanted her to be happy.

1161
01:15:15,902 --> 01:15:17,194
Well, she is happy.

1162
01:15:17,278 --> 01:15:19,988
Just look at her.
You two have a great life.

1163
01:15:21,782 --> 01:15:23,742
You don't know
about my life.

1164
01:15:23,826 --> 01:15:25,744
You have everything.

1165
01:15:25,828 --> 01:15:30,081
... proven to retard the 
signs of photo-aging.

1166
01:15:30,166 --> 01:15:33,168
Wait till she finds out 
they're gonna take the house.

1167
01:15:33,252 --> 01:15:36,129
I have samples for everyone. 
Don't be shy.

1168
01:15:36,214 --> 01:15:37,923
What?

1169
01:15:38,007 --> 01:15:39,382
That's right.

1170
01:15:39,467 --> 01:15:41,468
Can you say "foreclosure"?

1171
01:15:41,594 --> 01:15:44,012
Yeah, but, Larry, 
you're doing so well.

1172
01:15:44,096 --> 01:15:46,014
You're buying all this stuff.

1173
01:15:47,934 --> 01:15:50,685
Yeah. It's bigger 
than yours, isn't it?

1174
01:15:50,770 --> 01:15:53,813
Is that why you 
can't pay your bills?

1175
01:15:53,898 --> 01:15:56,233
Are you jealous?

1176
01:15:56,317 --> 01:16:00,362
Is there any way that you can return some 
of this stuff to pay down your mortgage?

1177
01:16:00,446 --> 01:16:03,782
That's it.
You're jealous of me. Huh?

1178
01:16:03,866 --> 01:16:08,245
You, uh ― You can't handle not being 
the center of attention for one night.

1179
01:16:08,329 --> 01:16:09,913
Is that it?

1180
01:16:09,997 --> 01:16:12,499
Oh.

1181
01:16:15,253 --> 01:16:18,380
Um, now what I'd like 
you all to do ―

1182
01:16:18,464 --> 01:16:21,132
Look, you don't understand.

1183
01:16:21,217 --> 01:16:23,593
All my stuff ― I don't pay for it.

1184
01:16:23,678 --> 01:16:26,846
- I don't pay for that stuff.
- Me neither. Not for six months, right?

1185
01:16:26,931 --> 01:16:29,057
- "Zero payments for six months."
- No, that's not it.

1186
01:16:29,141 --> 01:16:31,643
- Zero payments ― │- That's not 
what I mean. You don't get it.

1187
01:16:31,727 --> 01:16:33,937
Shh, guys. She's doing her thing.

1188
01:16:34,021 --> 01:16:37,482
You're supposed to be paying 
attention. You guys are so loud.

1189
01:16:37,608 --> 01:16:40,026
Why don't you come over 
and ― You know what?

1190
01:16:40,111 --> 01:16:42,821
Just a minute, sweetie.

1191
01:16:42,947 --> 01:16:45,198
- One minute. Okay.
- One ― Okay.

1192
01:16:47,785 --> 01:16:49,869
Oh.

1193
01:16:49,996 --> 01:16:52,914
What? Oh, I get it.

1194
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:56,209
- It's her money?
- Oh.

1195
01:16:56,294 --> 01:16:58,503
Your secret is safe with me, buddy.

1196
01:16:58,587 --> 01:17:01,047
Nice work.

1197
01:17:03,467 --> 01:17:05,302
I want you to socialize and 
have a wonderful time ...

1198
01:17:05,386 --> 01:17:07,387
and just have wonderful
memories of Robustion.

1199
01:17:10,224 --> 01:17:11,308
Okay.

1200
01:17:17,690 --> 01:17:21,860
- It's terrible. You know, he's 
a great guy. │- I know. I feel bad.

1201
01:17:21,944 --> 01:17:23,945
I actually think that ...

1202
01:17:25,197 --> 01:17:27,115
Summer did well tonight.

1203
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:29,617
And I broke down. I even 
bought some of her stuff.

1204
01:17:29,702 --> 01:17:31,619
That's nice of you.

1205
01:17:31,704 --> 01:17:33,830
Thank you.

1206
01:17:33,914 --> 01:17:36,166
This needs something.

1207
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:38,251
Hold that.

1208
01:17:42,548 --> 01:17:44,049
Treats.

1209
01:17:44,133 --> 01:17:46,134
Let me put some in for you.

1210
01:17:47,136 --> 01:17:49,471
Oh, no, no.

1211
01:17:49,597 --> 01:17:51,765
- No, that's not right.
- Mm-hmm.

1212
01:17:51,891 --> 01:17:54,559
- That's just ― │- It's so good.
- That's just all wrong.

1213
01:17:54,643 --> 01:17:57,395
Mm-mmm. Wait.
Just the perfect bite.

1214
01:18:02,526 --> 01:18:04,235
What about Arizona?

1215
01:18:06,447 --> 01:18:08,948
- What about it?
- You gonna come?

1216
01:18:11,369 --> 01:18:13,870
Wouldn't it be a little weird?
I mean, how are you 
gonna introduce me?

1217
01:18:13,954 --> 01:18:15,872
Like ―

1218
01:18:15,956 --> 01:18:18,958
"This is my pretend wife that I' ―

1219
01:18:19,043 --> 01:18:21,169
"My co-worker. My" ―

1220
01:18:21,253 --> 01:18:23,213
As my boss.

1221
01:18:23,297 --> 01:18:25,298
The job comes with great benefits.

1222
01:18:27,593 --> 01:18:29,594
That mean you'll come?

1223
01:18:33,474 --> 01:18:35,475
Hmm?

1224
01:18:40,648 --> 01:18:43,607
- Mmm! Mmm!
- I'll come.

1225
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:05,713
What the ― Larry?

1226
01:19:07,675 --> 01:19:09,676
Larry.

1227
01:19:17,393 --> 01:19:19,644
Larry?

1228
01:19:44,086 --> 01:19:49,632
Larry! Larry!

1229
01:19:49,717 --> 01:19:51,426
Larry!

Hey. You did everything you could.

No, I didn't.

1246
01:21:46,542 --> 01:21:48,543
I lied to him.

1247
01:21:50,087 --> 01:21:53,089
Here's your coat.

1248
01:21:53,173 --> 01:21:56,050
I lied to him.

1249
01:21:57,511 --> 01:22:00,847
I lied to all of you.

1250
01:22:00,973 --> 01:22:04,058
- Steve.
- I'm not Steve Jones.

1251
01:22:04,184 --> 01:22:06,144
- Steve.
- That is not my name.

1252
01:22:06,228 --> 01:22:07,562
Holy shit.

1253
01:22:07,646 --> 01:22:09,314
What?

1254
01:22:11,358 --> 01:22:13,901
- This is not my wife.
- Don't. Don't do this.

1255
01:22:13,986 --> 01:22:17,947
- These are not my kids.
- Steve, please.

1256
01:22:18,073 --> 01:22:19,657
- That is not my house.
- Settle down, Steve.

1257
01:22:19,742 --> 01:22:22,368
No, listen to me, goddamn it.
You all have to listen.

1258
01:22:22,453 --> 01:22:26,581
I get paid to show off
the cars and the clothes.

1259
01:22:26,665 --> 01:22:30,418
I get paid lots of money to lie 
and pretend that I'm your friend.

1260
01:22:30,502 --> 01:22:31,961
We have to leave.

1261
01:22:32,046 --> 01:22:35,048
So that people like all of 
you ― people like Larry ―

1262
01:22:35,132 --> 01:22:38,051
will go out and want to buy
the stuff that I have.

1263
01:22:38,135 --> 01:22:41,095
Me and my perfect family.

1264
01:22:57,279 --> 01:22:59,280
I'm sorry.

1265
01:23:14,922 --> 01:23:17,256
Come on. Let's go.

1266
01:23:17,341 --> 01:23:21,594
Not so fast, sir. I need to 
get some information from you.

1267
01:23:31,647 --> 01:23:33,523
That was crazy of him.

1268
01:23:33,607 --> 01:23:36,317
It's gonna be okay. I promise.
I'll take care of you.

1269
01:23:36,402 --> 01:23:38,486
- Is this accurate?
- Yes, it's accurate.

1270
01:23:38,570 --> 01:23:43,324
We might need to ask you a 
few more questions later on.

1271
01:23:43,409 --> 01:23:46,244
I think that's all.
Thank you, Mr. Cerrilla.

1272
01:24:51,685 --> 01:24:53,770
It's time to go, Steve.

1273
01:24:55,230 --> 01:24:57,148
Where'd you take them?

1274
01:24:57,232 --> 01:24:59,150
They've been reassigned.

1275
01:24:59,234 --> 01:25:03,446
She took the deal, like 
I told you she would.

1276
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:11,412
If you want a fresh start,
my offer's still on the table.

1277
01:25:25,803 --> 01:25:27,678
- Hello!
- Hi!

1278
01:25:27,805 --> 01:25:29,680
- Hey, Mary Beth.
- Come in.

1279
01:25:29,807 --> 01:25:31,808
This is great. This 
is great to do this.

1280
01:25:31,892 --> 01:25:34,560
Thank you so much.
Come on in.

1281
01:25:34,645 --> 01:25:36,395
Here, let me grab your coats.

1282
01:25:36,522 --> 01:25:38,481
- Ken, how about a beer?
- Sure, sure.

1283
01:25:38,565 --> 01:25:39,649
Imported okay?

1284
01:25:39,775 --> 01:25:41,317
- Welcome to the house.
- It's beautiful.

1285
01:25:41,401 --> 01:25:42,902
Thank you.

1286
01:25:42,986 --> 01:25:44,779
Honey, by the way, 
super job tonight.

1287
01:25:44,905 --> 01:25:47,657
- Thank you.
- Dinner was excellent.

1288
01:25:47,741 --> 01:25:49,659
Is everyone ready for coffee ...

1289
01:25:49,743 --> 01:25:51,911
and perhaps some, uh, dessert?

1290
01:25:52,037 --> 01:25:53,955
- Sounds great.
- Okay.

1291
01:25:54,039 --> 01:25:56,415
Help yourself to some more wine.

1292
01:26:08,345 --> 01:26:10,096
Kate.

1293
01:26:11,723 --> 01:26:14,725
Is ― Is everything okay
in there, sweetheart?

1294
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:18,771
What are you doing here?

1295
01:26:18,856 --> 01:26:21,065
Well, I wanted to see you.

1296
01:26:21,149 --> 01:26:23,442
Sorry.

1297
01:26:25,904 --> 01:26:28,281
Kate? You all right?

1298
01:26:30,784 --> 01:26:32,618
I've got, uh, guests here.

1299
01:26:32,703 --> 01:26:35,204
We belong together.

1300
01:26:35,289 --> 01:26:38,291
You should have thought of that 
before you opened your mouth.

1301
01:26:38,417 --> 01:26:42,670
- That's why I opened my mouth.
- Honey ―

1302
01:26:42,754 --> 01:26:44,672
Well, uh, who's this?

1303
01:26:48,385 --> 01:26:50,052
It's, uh, a friend.

1304
01:26:50,137 --> 01:26:53,139
Oh. Well, hey, I'm Bob, Bob Jones.

1305
01:26:53,223 --> 01:26:56,058
Drop the act, Bob.
I'm her last husband.

1306
01:26:56,143 --> 01:26:59,437
- What? What's going on?
- Nothing.

1307
01:26:59,563 --> 01:27:02,231
- Am I getting fired?
- You don't have to do this anymore.

1308
01:27:02,316 --> 01:27:05,693
- But my numbers are good.
- I think you should leave.

1309
01:27:05,777 --> 01:27:06,903
Right now? No.

1310
01:27:06,987 --> 01:27:08,321
- Bob.
- Yes?

1311
01:27:08,405 --> 01:27:10,364
Just calm down and go
back to our guests.

1312
01:27:11,742 --> 01:27:13,826
- Go on, Bob.
- Go!

1313
01:27:13,911 --> 01:27:16,537
- Um ― 
- Everything's fine.

1314
01:27:16,663 --> 01:27:18,414
- You certain?
- Yeah. Wine.

1315
01:27:18,498 --> 01:27:20,249
Oh, sure.

1316
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:23,377
I'm sorry. You were saying?

1317
01:27:23,462 --> 01:27:27,465
I want you to come join 
me in the real world.

1318
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:32,553
This is my real world.

1319
01:27:32,638 --> 01:27:36,057
What are you gonna do when you're too 
old to be a mother to these teenagers?

1320
01:27:36,141 --> 01:27:39,352
Are they gonna find a 
grandparent cell for you?

1321
01:27:39,436 --> 01:27:42,313
What kind of life is that?

1322
01:27:42,397 --> 01:27:44,482
What kind of joy are you gonna have?

1323
01:27:44,566 --> 01:27:47,485
Whose photos are you
gonna hang on your wall?

1324
01:27:47,569 --> 01:27:49,737
Who's gonna be there
at the end for you?

1325
01:27:51,031 --> 01:27:52,949
We had something, Kate.

1326
01:27:55,202 --> 01:27:56,953
It was just a 
beginning, but it ―

1327
01:27:57,037 --> 01:27:59,038
It was real.

1328
01:28:00,707 --> 01:28:03,167
I felt that.

1329
01:28:03,251 --> 01:28:05,378
I'm hoping you felt it too.

1330
01:28:05,462 --> 01:28:08,130
I think you did.

1331
01:28:08,215 --> 01:28:11,342
You deserve to be happy, Kate.

1332
01:28:11,426 --> 01:28:13,427
You deserve to be loved.

1333
01:28:33,657 --> 01:28:35,658
I'm sorry.

1334
01:28:55,637 --> 01:28:57,930
Hey, Steve.

1335
01:28:58,056 --> 01:29:00,474
- Hold up.
- Hey, Mick.

1336
01:29:00,559 --> 01:29:03,185
Hey.

1337
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:05,563
How are things?

1338
01:29:05,647 --> 01:29:07,857
Things are good. Yeah.

1339
01:29:07,983 --> 01:29:10,276
I get to be a college student now.

1340
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:12,695
Yeah. And I'm out, which ―

1341
01:29:12,779 --> 01:29:14,780
Well, it makes life a lot easier.

1342
01:29:14,906 --> 01:29:17,241
- That's great.
- Yeah.

1343
01:29:17,325 --> 01:29:19,410
I don't have to lie anymore.

1344
01:29:21,788 --> 01:29:23,789
I'm happy for you.

1345
01:29:23,874 --> 01:29:27,084
Thanks, Steve. It's been real.

1346
01:29:35,427 --> 01:29:39,263
Hey, uh, they've been
looking for that.

1347
01:29:41,099 --> 01:29:42,391
Ah.

1348
01:29:42,476 --> 01:29:44,769
I'm gonna miss that car.

1349
01:30:23,183 --> 01:30:25,184
He came back for you.

1350
01:31:39,092 --> 01:31:42,303
- Where to?
- Arizona.

1351
01:31:42,429 --> 01:31:44,471
- Seriously?
- Is that all right?

1352
01:31:44,556 --> 01:31:47,808
