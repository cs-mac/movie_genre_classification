00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:26,759
lt was you who left me a message saying
someone's been stalking you, wasn't it?

154
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,960
Yeah...

155
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,296
So l got worried.

156
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,830
l borrowed this for you.

157
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,000
Supposedly, you can use it to detect
listening devices and things.

158
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,265
A guy l know who's into this kind of
stuff told me about it.

159
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:41,740
l already checked, but l didn't find anything.

160
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,075
Really?

161
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:46,412
Yeah, l searched this room from top to bottom.

162
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,315
Okay, then l guess that's good enough.

163
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,749
Good enough?

164
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:54,981
lt's like, it doesn't bother me so much anymore.

165
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:56,922
What do you mean by that?

166
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,824
Nothing.

167
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:02,361
l just thought, maybe he isn't so bad, you know?

168
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:03,829
Don't tell me you're...

169
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:07,925
Oh, come on. Of course not.

170
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,936
Then why did you say it doesn't bother you?

171
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,641
Why do you care so much?

172
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,776
You could be lying.

173
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:20,045
To get my attention.

174
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:21,914
You're too cocky, you know that?

175
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:25,315
l'm not lying. lt was just my imagination.

176
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:26,946
Are you sure?

177
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:30,146
Let's leave it at that.

178
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:40,154
Hey, the water's spilling! The carpet!

179
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,267
l'm sorry. l haven't had time
for you in a long time.

180
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,371
Shoko...

181
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,872
l love you.

182
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,074
Of course l do.

183
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:50,442
l do.

184
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:52,177
On your birthday, l'll take you wherever
you want to go, Natsuko.

185
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:54,270
Really?

186
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,077
Shoko...

187
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:07,192
Did you have a fight with your
wife or something?

188
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:09,762
Why do you ask?

189
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,530
Because this is odd.

190
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,766
l came to see you because l wanted to see you.

191
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:17,302
What's odd about that?

192
00:12:17,302 --> 00:12:18,971
What about how l feel?

193
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,165
What?

194
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,473
What about when l want to see you?

195
00:12:22,207 --> 00:12:26,211
You just show up when you want to see me.

196
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:28,681
So is that the way it works?

197
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,581
Do l get to do it that way too?

198
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:33,452
You should have come when
you wanted to see me.

199
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,954
When l wanted to talk to you,
you told me not to call.

200
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:41,193
l leave messages on your phone
but you never call me back!

201
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:45,731
l wanted to talk to you!

202
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:49,401
l wanted to see you!

203
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,637
But you knew that was the deal
when you started seeing me!

204
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:55,107
You're right. l did know that.

205
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,810
But l always feel like l'm only talking to a phone,
you know, just talking to a machine.

206
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:04,450
l feel like my voice will never reach you.
lt tears me apart.

207
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,420
And l can't take it anymore!

208
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,823
Think about what you do for living.

209
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,925
lt's the same thing, isn't it?

210
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,485
You only talk into a microphone, don't you?

211
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:15,618
Get out...

212
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,094
l said, get out!

213
00:13:29,708 --> 00:14:14,052
Summer is almost over, huh?

214
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:16,021
Not even close! lt's still hot as hell at night!

215
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,658
The seasons are changing without you
even noticing, Mr. Uraoka.

216
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:22,752
Really? You sure about that?

217
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:26,262
All right, Shoko, are you ready?

218
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,336
Shoko?

219
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:32,304
Oh, yes!

220
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,705
All right then, let's go.

221
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:35,036
Okay!

222
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:39,873
What am l doing here anyway?

223
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:45,184
l just come to the studio and have meaningless
conversations with the staff like l always do.

224
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:50,956
Read faxes and emails...

225
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,125
l can't even manage my own problems,

226
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,028
yet l give other people advice on their
relationships as if l know better.

227
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,223
What am l doing?

228
00:14:58,997 --> 00:15:03,900
Moving on to the next fax.
This is from pen name ''Hibiscus.''

229
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:07,239
''There's something l want to talk to you about.''

230
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:11,039
''Well, actually the man l've been seeing has...''

231
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,939
''...a wife and kids.''

232
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:19,017
''l've started worrying lately''

233
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:21,486
''that maybe he doesn't really love me at all.''

234
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:25,824
''So tell me, Miss Shoko, you're the relationship
expert. What do you think l should do?''

235
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,760
l'm not...
''So tell me, Miss Shoko, you're the relationship
expert. What do you think l should do?''

236
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,819
''So tell me, Miss Shoko, you're the relationship
expert. What do you think l should do?''

237
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,364
l'm far from it.

238
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:32,831
l'm far from it.
''Okay, here's your advice from the
relationship expert, Shoko Saibara!''

239
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,633
l'm not a relationship expert.
''Okay, here's your advice from the
relationship expert, Shoko Saibara!''

240
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,802
l'm not a relationship expert.

241
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:37,734
Not at all!

242
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,004
Think about what you do for living.

243
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:41,139
lt's the same thing, isn't it?

244
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:43,664
You only talk into a microphone, don't you?

245
00:15:42,241 --> 00:16:08,734
l can't do this anymore...

246
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,202
Music! Get us music!

247
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,004
Right!

248
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,238
l can't give other people advice
on their relationships.

249
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,674
l can't talk anymore.

250
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,302
My voice will never reach anyone!

251
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:22,781
l can't... this anymore...

252
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,510
l'm sorry...

253
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:32,224
Check this out, everyone!

254
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,317
Hey, wait! You!

255
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:43,969
What?!

256
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:49,737
Username :
what?!
Username :
Is she going to leave the industry for good?!
Username :
Is she getting married?!
Username :
Sure dropped a bombshell there !

257
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,827
What's wrong with her?

258
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,847
l have no idea!

259
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:57,712
Anyway, we've got to do something
about it before the music ends!

260
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,315
Damn it! lt won't open!

261
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:19,697
Don't quit!

262
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:30,515
Don't tell me he's the one who...

263
00:17:30,515 --> 00:17:32,918
The music is almost over!

264
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,119
Play another one.

265
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,120
After Miss Shoko made that comment?

266
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,255
People will think it's weird if we
play two songs in a row!

267
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:39,758
But...

268
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,226
ls he in the booth?

269
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,095
But you can't go in there right now!

270
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,529
Can we set up the audio in a different booth?

271
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:46,565
We have to check which one is open first!

272
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,567
Not good! We don't have time for that!

273
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,592
The music is over!

274
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:56,602
The first time you called my name,
it made me really happy.

275
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:05,217
Up until that moment, no one had ever
bothered to call my name before.

276
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:10,814
l was always alone. lt was like l didn't even exist.

277
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,416
You're Radio Boy?

278
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:22,501
Yeah, you've always talked to me, just like that...

279
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:28,340
Radio Boy...

280
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,909
Because you talked to me,
l wasn't alone anymore.

281
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:35,847
l found a reason to exist.

282
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:39,510
So why did you say you were quitting?

283
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:44,356
l'm in pain. l can't even manage
my own problems.

284
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:49,861
So how can l give other people
advice on their problems?

285
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:53,732
l'm just sitting here alone
talking to a microphone.

286
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:57,335
Worrying that maybe my voice isn't
really reaching anyone.

287
00:18:57,335 --> 00:18:59,200
l'm here!

288
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,142
See, l'm here!

289
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:07,839
Can't you tell your voice has reached me?!

290
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:12,784
l'm always waiting for your voice!
l love your voice!

291
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:18,323
So you can never quit!

292
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,781
Why don't you understand something
as simple as that?!

293
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,826
Really? My voice is really...

294
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,893
Of course it's reaching.

295
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:38,877
HANG IN THERE!
DON'T GIVE UP.
WE'VE BEEN LISTENING
TO YOU ALL ALONG.
KEEP FIGHTING!

DON'T qUIT!

296

DON'T QUIT!!
Shoko, please don't quit.
You may have some tough times
but we're always here for you!
Keep up the good work!

297
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,602
Check out the message board!

298
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:44,646
Username :

Username :
Hang in there.
Username :
That' s right! I ' m here too!
Username :
Don ' t give up!

299
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,049
l'm starting the music!

300
00:19:54,693 --> 00:20:06,538
Man, l'm amazed he managed to get in here.

301
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,768
Goodness! Huh?

302
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,202
Shoko, here.

303
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:17,549
He brought it here.

304
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,177
You were going to give it to Shoko, right?

305
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:23,388
Thank you.

306
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,050
But l'm over sunflowers now.

307
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:28,820
Summer is over now.

308
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,924
