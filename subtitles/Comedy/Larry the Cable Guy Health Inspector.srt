00:00:24,972 --> 00:00:29,363
<i>You looked at Ray and said,</i>
<i>'I want him to be my boyfriend, -</i>

2
00:00:29,532 --> 00:00:33,571
<i>- but he's got to change. '</i>
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

3
00:00:33,732 --> 00:00:37,645
<i>One of the things</i>
<i>that initiated a misunderstanding -</i>

4
00:00:37,812 --> 00:00:41,725
<i>- was that one day,</i>
<i>I didn't want to have sex with him.</i>

5
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:46,170
<i>So he starts talking about</i>
<i>calling somebody else to do it.</i>

6
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:54,803
<i>Stop at $4,000!</i>

7
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:59,090
<i>You'd been drinking, and you thought</i>
<i>you were making love to me.</i>

8
00:01:03,372 --> 00:01:07,001
<i>This differs from a normal massage.</i>

9
00:01:14,772 --> 00:01:17,889
<i>- Jamie, I ...</i>
<i>- No!</i>

10
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:25,481
<i>This television funny-man</i>
<i>killed his brother in cold blood.</i>

11
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:29,247
<i>My guests have crushes</i>

12
00:01:29,412 --> 00:01:33,530
<i>Mr. Davis, do you take</i>
<i>cream and sugar in your eye?</i>

13
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:43,730
<i>Do you want to tell them something?</i>

14
00:01:43,892 --> 00:01:47,487
<i>I'm really a man.</i>

15
00:01:56,292 --> 00:02:00,444
Where's the cable guy?

16
00:02:10,052 --> 00:02:12,850
Rick Legatos, please.

17
00:02:16,612 --> 00:02:21,163
- Hey Rick, phone.
- How's the move going?

18
00:02:21,332 --> 00:02:27,009
The cable guy is missing in action.
I hope he gets here before I die.

19
00:02:27,172 --> 00:02:32,007
- You haven't called Robin?
- No. I'm giving her her space.

20
00:02:32,172 --> 00:02:36,882
- I can't believe she's doing this.
- You shouldn't have proposed.

21
00:02:37,052 --> 00:02:41,011
All she had to do was say no.
She didn't have to kick me out.

22
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:45,290
<i>- Let's go!</i>
- Just give me a minute!

23
00:02:45,452 --> 00:02:48,489
<i>Listen, a piece of advice ...</i>

24
00:02:48,652 --> 00:02:54,284
Slip the cable guy $50, he'll give
you all the movie channels for free.

25
00:02:54,452 --> 00:02:59,287
I'm not good at that stuff.
What if he says no?

26
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:02,364
None of them say no.

27
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:06,411
<i>- I've got to go. Talk to you later.</i>
- All right.

28
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:15,604
<i>Hi, this is Robin Harris.</i>
<i>Steven doesn't live here anymore ...</i>

29
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:40,729
<i>- Cable guy!</i>
- Oh, great!

30
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:46,090
<i>- Cable guy!</i>
- Don't leave!

31
00:03:49,572 --> 00:03:52,644
- Wait!
<i>- Cable guy!</i>

32
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:56,930
- I'm coming!
<i>- Cable guy!</i>

33
00:03:59,652 --> 00:04:01,331
<i>Cable guy!</i>

34
00:04:01,332 --> 00:04:02,242
<i>Cable guy!</i>

35
00:04:05,692 --> 00:04:09,651
Wait! Come back.

36
00:04:11,092 --> 00:04:15,643
- Look who decided to show.
- You should have come hours ago.

37
00:04:15,812 --> 00:04:20,522
Should l?
So, I'm the tardy one?

38
00:04:20,692 --> 00:04:25,049
Yeah. I was going to the
bed-and-bath place. Now it's closed.

39
00:04:25,212 --> 00:04:29,683
Maybe I shouldn't have come at all.
Jerk off!

40
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:34,801
I'm just joking with you.

41
00:04:37,372 --> 00:04:42,969
The old McNair place! Never thought
they'd get the floors clean ...

42
00:04:43,132 --> 00:04:48,445
- What happened?
- They had a lot of cats.

43
00:04:48,612 --> 00:04:52,525
- Please mail this in when I'm done.
- Does it go to your boss?

44
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:57,527
No, it goes to me.
I'm kind of a perfectioniss ...

45
00:04:57,692 --> 00:05:00,809
Perfectioniss ... t.

46
00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:05,650
Let's take a look.

47
00:05:10,012 --> 00:05:13,243
This could be a cool pad.

48
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:18,289
Come on, baby.

49
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:23,924
Come on, baby.
Talk to me.

50
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:28,768
Tell me where you like it.

51
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:38,291
Hello, Mama.

52
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:44,730
Ls this what you want?
Ls this where you need it?

53
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:53,050
How about this?

54
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:03,729
That's your sweet spot, right there.

55
00:06:08,172 --> 00:06:10,811
Your lady kicked you out.

56
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,608
What?

57
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:21,530
I noticed you were previously wired
at 1 2681 <i>l</i>2 Chestnut.

58
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:27,244
Last week, the billing
was transferred to one Robin Harris.

59
00:06:27,412 --> 00:06:32,247
- Smells like heartbreak to me.
- I don't want to discuss that.

60
00:06:32,412 --> 00:06:37,122
- Just install my cable, please.
- Suit yourself.

61
00:06:37,292 --> 00:06:40,489
No sweat off my sack.

62
00:06:40,652 --> 00:06:44,281
You might want to
put on a bathing suit.

63
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:48,764
You'll be channel surfing
in no time.

64
00:07:02,892 --> 00:07:07,283
<i>So ends day 54 of the trial</i>
<i>of former child star, Sam Sweet, -</i>

65
00:07:07,452 --> 00:07:11,491
<i>- who has been accused of shooting</i>
<i>his brother Stan in cold blood.</i>

66
00:07:11,652 --> 00:07:17,602
<i>The twins were stars of</i>
<i>the hit sitcom, 'Double Trouble'.</i>

67
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:21,367
- Who broke this?
- He did it!

68
00:07:21,532 --> 00:07:27,004
<i>Life wasn't sweet</i>
<i>after their programme was cancelled.</i>

69
00:07:27,172 --> 00:07:30,164
<i>Sam turned to petty larceny, -</i>

70
00:07:30,332 --> 00:07:35,531
<i>- while his brother fell in with</i>
<i>the cult 'Brotherhood of Friends'.</i>

71
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:41,928
I hope they fry this bastard.

72
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:52,361
What happened?

73
00:07:52,532 --> 00:07:57,526
Your furniture and appliances were
causing problems with the reception.

74
00:07:58,492 --> 00:08:04,124
- I moved a few things, okay?
- Yeah, I guess.

75
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:08,205
I just have some paperwork
for you to fill out.

76
00:08:08,372 --> 00:08:14,481
It's a drag. You just get to know
somebody and then the job is done.

77
00:08:14,652 --> 00:08:18,042
Sign here.

78
00:08:27,612 --> 00:08:31,525
I feel good about this.

79
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:38,885
Hey, wait!

80
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:44,809
I have this friend,
and he gave his cable guy $50 ...

81
00:08:44,972 --> 00:08:49,887
He got all the movie channels
for free. Did you ever hear of that?

82
00:08:57,572 --> 00:09:02,885
- You mean illegal cable?
- Yeah ...

83
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:06,567
- Who told you that?
- Forget it.

84
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:08,927
You're offering me a bribe.

85
00:09:09,092 --> 00:09:14,724
That's illegal. You could be fined
up to $5,000 or go to jail.

86
00:09:14,892 --> 00:09:18,601
No, I was just making conversation.
Forget it.

87
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:26,565
I'm just jerking your chain.

88
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:35,442
You are too easy. Wake up.
Smell the smelling salt.

89
00:09:35,612 --> 00:09:37,887
I'll juice you up.

90
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:43,641
- One guy doing another guy a solid.
- That is so nice.

91
00:09:43,812 --> 00:09:51,162
Well, you're a nice guy.
Many customers treat me like snot.

92
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:55,245
Here's my personal pager number.

93
00:09:55,412 --> 00:10:01,885
- The company puts you on hold.
- Thanks. You'll get good marks.

94
00:10:02,052 --> 00:10:06,648
Maybe I'll show you the satellite,
how this whole thing works.

95
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:11,169
- Sure, we should do that one day.
- How about tomorrow?

96
00:10:11,332 --> 00:10:17,851
- Tomorrow's no good.
- You'll be stewing about your ex?

97
00:10:19,332 --> 00:10:22,927
No.

98
00:10:23,092 --> 00:10:29,964
- I crossed the line. Sorry.
- You didn't cross the line.

99
00:10:30,132 --> 00:10:34,011
Cool! Pick you up at six-thirty.

100
00:10:36,372 --> 00:10:41,810
There are 2 4 classrooms.
Each can be converted into a home.

101
00:10:41,972 --> 00:10:48,127
There's a swimming pool,
tennis courts, a gym and a stage, ...

102
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:52,001
If the residents decide
they want to perform "Oklahoma".

103
00:10:52,172 --> 00:10:57,724
- Oklahoma!
- It's available in foreclosure.

104
00:10:57,892 --> 00:11:01,282
With a cash bid,
we can steal this thing.

105
00:11:12,012 --> 00:11:15,527
Tough room, but you got them.

106
00:11:15,692 --> 00:11:19,890
Are you having
a little domestic discord?

107
00:11:20,052 --> 00:11:25,080
Robin and I are having difficulties.
I think it's only temporary.

108
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:31,248
If you screw this project up,
it's not going to be my ass.

109
00:11:31,412 --> 00:11:34,449
- Do you know what I mean?
- I'm on it.

110
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:38,605
<i>I'm more patient. I'm more loving.</i>
<i>They tell me this.</i>

111
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:43,288
<i>There's something in everyone's life</i>
<i>they could improve.</i>

112
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:49,641
<i>If they're doing well financially,</i>
<i>maybe their relationships suffer ...</i>

113
00:11:49,812 --> 00:11:56,411
<i>Call now, and you'll be rushed</i>
<i>the 'Personal Power Success System. '</i>

114
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:03,120
Steven!

115
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:06,489
Stevie, time to leavie!

116
00:12:08,612 --> 00:12:14,847
Come on down!
Are you waiting for an invitation?

117
00:12:15,012 --> 00:12:19,210
It's the fun bus. Come on!

118
00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:25,324
- How's it going?
- Hey, buddy!

119
00:12:26,252 --> 00:12:29,244
I've had a few drinks,
so buckle up.

120
00:12:29,412 --> 00:12:35,567
That's my humour.
Thanks for coming out.

121
00:12:35,732 --> 00:12:41,682
Most people never take the time
to understand how the cable works.

122
00:12:41,852 --> 00:12:47,882
- Where exactly are we going?
- To ride the information highway.

123
00:13:11,372 --> 00:13:16,492
I come up here to think sometimes.
Clear my head.

124
00:13:16,652 --> 00:13:20,281
Brace yourself.

125
00:13:21,532 --> 00:13:23,409
There she is.

126
00:13:30,732 --> 00:13:35,362
She's sending entertainment and
information to millions of citizens.

127
00:13:35,532 --> 00:13:42,449
- That's pretty impressive.
- I knew you'd appreciate this.

128
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:50,842
The future is now!

129
00:13:51,012 --> 00:13:55,449
Soon every home will integrate their
television, phone and computer.

130
00:13:55,612 --> 00:14:00,402
You'll be able to visit the Louvre,
or watch female mud wrestling.

131
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:05,771
You can shop from your home, or play
video games with someone in Vietnam.

132
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:10,323
There's no end to the possibilities!

133
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:17,208
When I was a kid, my mom worked
nights. I never met my father.

134
00:14:17,372 --> 00:14:21,843
- But the TV was always there.
- I know what you mean.

135
00:14:22,012 --> 00:14:24,810
My dad might as well have been away.

136
00:14:27,812 --> 00:14:32,283
That's tough. You must have
a lot of abandonment issues.

137
00:14:32,452 --> 00:14:35,569
Reality isn't
"Father Knows Best" any more.

138
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:39,884
It's a kick in the face
with a steel-toe work boot, ...

139
00:14:40,052 --> 00:14:45,809
And a trip to the hospital
for reconstructive surgery.

140
00:14:46,812 --> 00:14:50,930
But what doesn't kill us
makes us stronger, right?

141
00:14:51,612 --> 00:14:56,288
My brother is a speech therapist.

142
00:14:57,932 --> 00:15:01,004
So?

143
00:15:01,172 --> 00:15:04,084
Never mind.

144
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:10,927
- You're pretty love-struck, huh?
- I miss her.

145
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:16,007
- I proposed, and she kicked me out.
- I hate that.

146
00:15:16,172 --> 00:15:23,726
- She said I pressed too hard.
- Women are a labyrinth, my friend.

147
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:26,850
Can I be frank?

148
00:15:27,012 --> 00:15:33,042
I don't think you listen to her.
You tell her what she wants to hear.

149
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:37,251
She wants you to thirst
for knowledge about who she is.

150
00:15:37,412 --> 00:15:41,690
All the complicated splendor
that is woman.

151
00:15:41,852 --> 00:15:47,848
When your love is truly giving,
it will come back to you tenfold.

152
00:15:48,012 --> 00:15:51,721
You're right.
That's incredibly insightful.

153
00:15:51,892 --> 00:15:55,965
It was Jerry Springer's
final thought on Friday's show.

154
00:16:02,972 --> 00:16:08,092
Women love "Sleepless in Seattle."
it's on HBO this month.

155
00:16:08,252 --> 00:16:12,211
- That's your bait.
- Robin loves that movie.

156
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:19,528
Tell her you're cooking yourself
dinner and watching it by yourself.

157
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:25,050
- She'll come running.
- Maybe I'll give it a try.

158
00:16:25,212 --> 00:16:29,888
It's embarrassing,
I don't even know your name.

159
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:33,203
Do you really want to know my name?

160
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:36,284
You do?

161
00:16:41,692 --> 00:16:47,881
It's Ernie Douglas.
But my friends call me Chip.

162
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:03,642
Goodbye.

163
00:17:04,652 --> 00:17:07,849
This concludes our broadcast day.
Click.

164
00:17:08,012 --> 00:17:12,961
I don't listen to you.
I pretend to understand.

165
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:16,363
I'm just saying
what I think you want to hear.

166
00:17:16,532 --> 00:17:24,325
I'm interested in learning about the
complicated splendor that is you.

167
00:17:24,492 --> 00:17:31,011
I can see that taking this time
might be good for us. I'm not mad.

168
00:17:32,772 --> 00:17:38,130
- Sometimes time apart is healthy.
- You're right.

169
00:17:39,372 --> 00:17:43,524
That's what I came here to say.

170
00:17:43,692 --> 00:17:46,923
I have to get back to the office.

171
00:17:48,252 --> 00:17:54,441
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Cook dinner and watch a movie.

172
00:17:54,612 --> 00:17:59,481
- "Sleepless in Seattle" is on TV.
- I love that movie.

173
00:17:59,652 --> 00:18:02,803
Why don't you come by?

174
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:07,762
- Maybe I will.
- Whatever.

175
00:18:11,932 --> 00:18:15,686
<i>I'm Tabitha Soren.</i>
<i>Today in the Sam Sweet case, -</i>

176
00:18:15,852 --> 00:18:20,687
<i>- the prosecution played the call</i>
<i>Sam made on the night of the murder.</i>

177
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:23,889
<i>Mr. Sweet confessed one month later.</i>

178
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:28,204
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>My twin brother's been shot.</i>

179
00:18:28,372 --> 00:18:33,241
<i>I think it was</i>
<i>an Asian gang or something!</i>

180
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:39,203
<i>I saw someone. He was speaking</i>
<i>another language. I'm pretty sure -</i>

181
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,241
<i>- it was Asian.</i>

182
00:18:53,812 --> 00:18:56,770
He had the same injury last year.

183
00:18:56,932 --> 00:19:00,163
You guys play here too?

184
00:19:02,212 --> 00:19:06,364
I thought I'd see if anybody
wanted to play round ball.

185
00:19:06,532 --> 00:19:10,923
- Great. We need another man.
- Chip Douglas, my cable guy.

186
00:19:11,092 --> 00:19:14,767
We met a week ago,
but I feel I've always known him.

187
00:19:14,932 --> 00:19:18,242
That's sweet.

188
00:19:19,172 --> 00:19:23,131
- Chip Douglas, you're on my team.
- No way.

189
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:28,412
- I'm on Steven's team.
- I'll switch teams. Let's play.

190
00:19:28,572 --> 00:19:32,326
I've got to warm up!
I don't want to pull a hammy.

191
00:19:57,212 --> 00:20:00,841
- Let's get it on.
- You any good?

192
00:20:01,012 --> 00:20:03,480
You'll find out.

193
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:06,928
Check it.

194
00:20:07,092 --> 00:20:09,845
Looks good.

195
00:20:10,012 --> 00:20:14,244
Let's see what you got,
White Shadow.

196
00:20:14,412 --> 00:20:16,846
Foul!

197
00:20:17,012 --> 00:20:21,324
- That was a travel!
- Whatever you say, Chip!

198
00:20:21,492 --> 00:20:25,280
I see.
We're playing prison rules, huh?

199
00:21:02,772 --> 00:21:05,127
Feed me!

200
00:21:08,172 --> 00:21:14,850
Steven, I'm open!
Feed me the rock!

201
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:20,048
Chip, over here!

202
00:21:51,332 --> 00:21:55,245
I love this game.

203
00:21:57,092 --> 00:22:01,847
- I guess we're done.
- Thanks for bringing your friend.

204
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:09,961
I never made a slam dunk before.
Thanks for the boost.

205
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:15,364
What are you doing?

206
00:22:15,532 --> 00:22:20,128
- I'm just talking trash.
- You ruined the game.

207
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:23,807
Friends don't speak to each other
like that.

208
00:22:23,972 --> 00:22:28,090
We're not friends.
I don't even know you.

209
00:22:28,252 --> 00:22:34,327
- Let me buy you a Heineken.
- I'm going home.

210
00:22:34,492 --> 00:22:38,883
I guess we'll talk later.
I have to do some stuff anyway.

211
00:22:48,612 --> 00:22:52,730
<i>You have 11 new messages.</i>

212
00:22:52,892 --> 00:22:57,682
<i>Steven, it's Mom. Call me.</i>
<i>I'm still your mother, you know.</i>

213
00:22:57,852 --> 00:23:01,481
<i>Steven, call your mother.</i>

214
00:23:01,652 --> 00:23:06,851
<i>Hey, Steven. Give me a ring.</i>
<i>I'm at 555-4329.</i>

215
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:12,530
<i>I'm at a pay phone.</i>
<i>If you're there, pick up.</i>

216
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:15,729
<i>I'll be home later.</i>

217
00:23:15,892 --> 00:23:20,807
<i>Okay, I'm home.</i>
<i>Give me a buzz when you get in.</i>

218
00:23:20,972 --> 00:23:25,807
<i>It's me again. I was taking a whiz.</i>
<i>Thought you might have called.</i>

219
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:30,760
<i>We're having ourselves</i>
<i>a game of phone tag here.</i>

220
00:23:32,292 --> 00:23:38,447
<i>I was just blow-drying my hair ...</i>
<i>Thought I heard the phone ring.</i>

221
00:23:39,772 --> 00:23:43,003
<i>I think your machine is ...</i>

222
00:23:53,172 --> 00:23:57,848
- Hey, good to see you.
- You too.

223
00:24:06,852 --> 00:24:09,969
- So how's work?
- Work's good.

224
00:24:10,132 --> 00:24:16,048
- How's Hal?
- The guy has no vision.

225
00:24:16,212 --> 00:24:21,809
It's like working for Mr. Magoo.
And those hair plugs ...

226
00:24:21,972 --> 00:24:28,764
He's just an utterly useless person.
I think I hate him.

227
00:24:28,932 --> 00:24:35,280
- It's nice to see you doing well.
- It's nice just to see you.

228
00:24:36,452 --> 00:24:40,684
Hey.
Lt should be on now.

229
00:24:49,092 --> 00:24:53,449
Damn it.
The cable's out.

230
00:24:54,332 --> 00:24:59,884
I know what to do.
The cable guy is a friend of mine.

231
00:25:00,052 --> 00:25:05,001
I'm a preferred customer.
All I have to do is page him.

232
00:25:18,412 --> 00:25:24,123
- Hi. Is there a problem?
- My cable's out.

233
00:25:25,772 --> 00:25:30,527
Really?
So you called me.

234
00:25:30,692 --> 00:25:34,128
Funny, how you call
when you need something.

235
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:40,288
- ls that how you treat people?
- I've been busy. Robin is here.

236
00:25:41,772 --> 00:25:47,404
- This is important.
- But calling me back isn't?

237
00:25:47,572 --> 00:25:51,645
I'm sorry.
Can you help me out?

238
00:25:52,692 --> 00:25:57,891
Why should I help you?
I gave you free cable.

239
00:25:58,052 --> 00:26:02,091
- What have you ever done for me?
- Anything you want.

240
00:26:02,252 --> 00:26:07,645
- Tomorrow night we hang out.
- Fine, anything you want.

241
00:26:07,812 --> 00:26:13,648
God bless you.
You're too good to me.

242
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,284
All set!

243
00:26:28,572 --> 00:26:34,204
- What's with the cut cord?
- That's for effect. Until tomorrow.

244
00:26:34,372 --> 00:26:38,411
She's pretty. Don't kiss her.
Don't even touch her.

245
00:26:38,572 --> 00:26:45,330
Resist the urge at all costs.
It'll pay off in the end.

246
00:26:45,492 --> 00:26:48,165
See what I'm saying?

247
00:26:51,212 --> 00:26:54,329
Enjoy the flick.

248
00:26:56,692 --> 00:27:00,048
That was fast.

249
00:27:00,212 --> 00:27:04,683
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Don't I look fine?

250
00:27:04,852 --> 00:27:10,085
<i>That isn't how it's done.</i>
<i>I'd rather just see somebody I like.</i>

251
00:27:10,252 --> 00:27:15,770
<i>Get a feeling about them,</i>
<i>and ask them if they'd like a drink.</i>

252
00:27:15,932 --> 00:27:19,845
<i>- Or a slice of pizza?</i>
<i>- Does it still work this way?</i>

253
00:27:20,012 --> 00:27:23,971
<i>- It doesn't. They ask you.</i>
<i>- I'm starting to notice that.</i>

254
00:27:24,132 --> 00:27:27,886
<i>If you get a new wife,</i>
<i>do you get to have sex with her?</i>

255
00:27:28,052 --> 00:27:33,126
<i>- I certainly hope so.</i>
<i>- Will she scratch up your back?</i>

256
00:27:33,292 --> 00:27:35,283
<i>What?</i>

257
00:27:35,452 --> 00:27:39,764
<i>In movies, women always scratch</i>
<i>the man when they're having sex.</i>

258
00:27:39,932 --> 00:27:43,925
<i>- How do you know this?</i>
<i>- Jed's got cable.</i>

259
00:27:53,092 --> 00:27:59,725
- Mommy's got to go out now.
- When will I get a brother?

260
00:27:59,892 --> 00:28:03,009
That's why Mommy is going out.

261
00:28:03,172 --> 00:28:08,200
Just sit there with Mr. Babysitter
and he'lI take good care of you.

262
00:28:08,372 --> 00:28:12,923
Don't sit so close to that thing.
It's going to rot your brain.

263
00:28:15,332 --> 00:28:20,645
<i>- Why didn't you take my call?</i>
<i>- I can't always pick up the phone.</i>

264
00:28:21,412 --> 00:28:25,769
<i>Your nostrils flare</i>
<i>when you're mad.</i>

265
00:28:33,572 --> 00:28:38,487
Sorry about yesterday.
How did everything go with you?

266
00:28:38,652 --> 00:28:42,247
- Keep them closed!
- Pretty well. The other night ...

267
00:28:42,412 --> 00:28:45,643
I want this to be a surprise.

268
00:28:45,812 --> 00:28:51,284
- Where are we going?
- The finest restaurant in town.

269
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:55,769
Open ... sesame.

270
00:28:55,932 --> 00:28:58,685
Medieval Times?

271
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:05,050
I knew you'd like it.
I come twice a week.

272
00:29:05,212 --> 00:29:12,288
I'm your serving wench, Melinda.
Care for something from the barkeep?

273
00:29:13,172 --> 00:29:16,164
Dost thust have thou a mug of ale?

274
00:29:16,332 --> 00:29:22,726
Me mate here, pitched in battle for
a fortnight, has a king's thirst.

275
00:29:24,492 --> 00:29:30,408
- I'll be right back, My Lord.
- My thanks to ye, fair wench.

276
00:29:32,852 --> 00:29:35,002
Thanks.

277
00:29:35,172 --> 00:29:41,327
- Look, I have to tell you ...
- Hold that thought. Show's on.

278
00:29:41,492 --> 00:29:47,681
Welcome to a magnificent journey ...
into the past.

279
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:51,731
This is Medieval Times!

280
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:58,924
Are you prepared for a night
of feasting and sport...

281
00:29:59,092 --> 00:30:02,801
The likes of which
you'll never forget?

282
00:30:03,412 --> 00:30:08,008
Stand up and cheer
for your section's knight!

283
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:12,245
Let the games begin!
The blue knight rules!

284
00:30:12,412 --> 00:30:19,329
The red knight sucks the big one!
You're going down, red knight!

285
00:30:19,492 --> 00:30:24,725
Going down, down, down!
Red knight going down!

286
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:30,167
Smite him!

287
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:38,765
- Could I get a knife and fork?
- There were none in medieval times.

288
00:30:38,932 --> 00:30:42,766
- More Pepsi?
- There was Pepsi, but no utensils?

289
00:30:42,932 --> 00:30:45,127
I've got a lot of tables.

290
00:30:50,252 --> 00:30:54,370
Can I have your skin?
Check this out.

291
00:31:00,612 --> 00:31:05,003
"Silence of the Lambs."

292
00:31:05,172 --> 00:31:08,801
Hello, Clarice.
It's good to see you again.

293
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:17,051
This has nothing to do with you
as a person ...

294
00:31:17,212 --> 00:31:20,363
We have reached the climax
of our competition.

295
00:31:20,532 --> 00:31:27,688
Two noblemen from our audience
will battle to the death.

296
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:34,769
Master Steven Kovacs and Lord Chip,
come to the fighting pit!

297
00:31:35,612 --> 00:31:38,763
- Let's go.
- What's going on?

298
00:31:38,932 --> 00:31:42,845
- We're going to do battle.
- Ls this a normal part of the show?

299
00:31:43,012 --> 00:31:48,405
No, but I give all the knights
free cable.

300
00:31:48,572 --> 00:31:52,565
- ls it safe?
- Yes! That's what the armour's for!

301
00:31:54,452 --> 00:31:58,730
We have to be careful
not to hurt each other, right?

302
00:31:58,892 --> 00:32:04,888
I cannot listen to you,
for you are my sworn enemy.

303
00:32:10,572 --> 00:32:13,769
Just take it easy, all right?

304
00:32:21,012 --> 00:32:24,322
Nice move.

305
00:32:25,212 --> 00:32:28,727
Necessity ...
is the mother of invention.

306
00:32:31,812 --> 00:32:35,441
Come back ...
so that I may brain thee!

307
00:32:39,412 --> 00:32:43,610
My leg!
I have a cramp!

308
00:32:43,772 --> 00:32:46,684
Are you all right?

309
00:32:48,372 --> 00:32:51,728
I am now.

310
00:32:58,492 --> 00:33:00,687
Oh my God!

311
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:12,446
That's the spirit!
Let's give them a show!

312
00:33:24,572 --> 00:33:30,522
I'm blinded! My eyes!

313
00:33:33,252 --> 00:33:36,722
I don't believe you.
It's another trick.

314
00:33:36,892 --> 00:33:42,524
So that's how it's going to be?
You want to play rough?

315
00:33:42,692 --> 00:33:45,923
Daddy can play rough!

316
00:33:47,372 --> 00:33:53,288
This is like when Spock fought Kirk.
Best friends forced to do battle.

317
00:34:13,812 --> 00:34:17,600
Chip, this isn't funny!
Stop it!

318
00:34:18,612 --> 00:34:24,482
The name is Spock. If we don't fight
to the death, they'll kill us both.

319
00:34:24,652 --> 00:34:27,120
This isn't "Star Trek".

320
00:34:32,332 --> 00:34:35,847
Goodbye, Jim.

321
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:55,289
Good fight.

322
00:34:55,452 --> 00:34:58,808
Keep eating!

323
00:35:01,252 --> 00:35:04,369
Quickly! Muster atop your steed.

324
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:11,845
Get on the friggin' horse.
I don't think he's kidding.

325
00:35:12,012 --> 00:35:16,688
- Don't do this!
- Good luck to you!

326
00:35:16,852 --> 00:35:21,562
- This is our destiny!
- No, it's not!

327
00:35:21,732 --> 00:35:25,691
- Yes, it is!
- No, it isn't!

328
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:38,044
Are you all right?

329
00:35:42,772 --> 00:35:47,402
Well done, good sir.
You are the victor.

330
00:35:47,572 --> 00:35:50,962
But we will meet again.

331
00:36:06,412 --> 00:36:10,007
Did you hear that?

332
00:36:10,172 --> 00:36:15,644
- You have a warrior's instinct.
- I had a real feeling of power.

333
00:36:15,812 --> 00:36:20,044
If Robin had seen you,
she'd be begging you to come back.

334
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:23,443
These knights get laid all the time!

335
00:36:23,612 --> 00:36:27,321
We should go again next week.

336
00:36:27,492 --> 00:36:33,169
<i>- You have no messages.</i>
- Nobody loves you.

337
00:36:33,332 --> 00:36:39,009
I left something in the living room.
Will you check it out for me?

338
00:36:39,172 --> 00:36:42,960
Just a little piece of equipment.

339
00:36:48,532 --> 00:36:53,925
- What do you think?
- What is all this?

340
00:36:54,732 --> 00:37:01,365
It appears as if someone has updated
your home entertainment system.

341
00:37:02,092 --> 00:37:07,086
I got you the big-screen TV,
deluxe karaoke machine...

342
00:37:07,252 --> 00:37:12,531
And THX quality sound that would
make George Lucas cream his pants.

343
00:37:12,692 --> 00:37:19,450
- You got in here when I was out?
- How else could I get the stuff in?

344
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:23,651
- How much did all of this cost?
- Practically nothing.

345
00:37:23,812 --> 00:37:28,727
I have a connection.
I hook him up, he hooks me up.

346
00:37:28,892 --> 00:37:33,329
- I can't accept this.
- Why not?

347
00:37:33,492 --> 00:37:37,405
You give me something more valuable.
Friendship.

348
00:37:37,572 --> 00:37:44,284
You give me friendship. We're even.
You have to take this stuff back.

349
00:37:47,892 --> 00:37:55,162
- Can I leave it here till Saturday.
- Sure. No problem.

350
00:37:55,332 --> 00:38:01,567
<i>Hi, this is Robin Harris. Steven</i>
<i>doesn't live here any more ...</i>

351
00:38:01,732 --> 00:38:06,965
Hey, it's Steven.
I'm still trying to reach you ...

352
00:38:07,132 --> 00:38:10,647
I'm at the office. Call me.

353
00:38:11,572 --> 00:38:14,644
- How's it going?
- Good.

354
00:38:14,812 --> 00:38:19,169
Good.
Keep it up. It's your ass.

355
00:38:19,332 --> 00:38:22,608
<i>It's Robin on line two.</i>

356
00:38:22,772 --> 00:38:27,527
I had the best time the other night.
When will I see you again?

357
00:38:27,692 --> 00:38:33,085
- How about tomorrow?
- Chip!

358
00:38:33,252 --> 00:38:36,722
I knew I'd get you
on the phone that way.

359
00:38:36,892 --> 00:38:42,012
Let's break the cherry
on that karaoke machine.

360
00:38:42,172 --> 00:38:46,688
- What does that mean?
<i>- Karaoke jam. No ifs, ands or buts.</i>

361
00:38:46,852 --> 00:38:52,051
Maybe a few buts.
Big ones!

362
00:39:12,532 --> 00:39:15,524
You're going on a date?

363
00:39:15,692 --> 00:39:22,370
We're not officially back together.
And you said time apart is good.

364
00:39:22,532 --> 00:39:27,481
Yes. Time apart from each other,
but not with other people.

365
00:39:27,652 --> 00:39:29,688
<i>That's time with someone else.</i>

366
00:39:29,852 --> 00:39:35,165
<i>- I love you, but I have to go. Bye.</i>
- Bye.

367
00:39:42,892 --> 00:39:47,010
This is just a sign
that you need to live a little.

368
00:39:48,212 --> 00:39:53,730
- She's having fun. You should, too.
- Maybe you're right.

369
00:39:54,492 --> 00:40:00,681
- I got you a little something.
- You said we were even.

370
00:40:00,852 --> 00:40:05,721
You're breaking the rules.
What is it?

371
00:40:09,252 --> 00:40:13,723
LOOSE YOUR LISP lN 30 DAYS

372
00:40:13,892 --> 00:40:17,487
My brother thought
it might help you.

373
00:40:17,652 --> 00:40:23,329
- This is ... There's no words ...
- It's no big deal.

374
00:40:23,492 --> 00:40:27,610
Yes, it is!
Lt is to me.

375
00:40:27,772 --> 00:40:32,368
Now I'm on a mission.

376
00:40:32,532 --> 00:40:37,560
This is going to be
the best damn karaoke jam ever.

377
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:50,645
We're really bopping!

378
00:40:51,932 --> 00:40:56,687
- You have some nice friends.
- They're just preferred customers.

379
00:40:56,852 --> 00:41:01,323
Chick alert, two o'clock.
What a licorice!

380
00:41:04,732 --> 00:41:08,202
- Don't look.
- You're just playing with me.

381
00:41:08,372 --> 00:41:13,162
- She's all over you.
- Shut up.

382
00:41:13,332 --> 00:41:19,043
L'd strike while the iron is hot.
He who hesitates, masturbates.

383
00:41:19,212 --> 00:41:22,204
Go.

384
00:41:23,652 --> 00:41:28,806
- Hey. I'm Steven.
- Heather.

385
00:41:28,972 --> 00:41:34,410
- Can I get you a beer?
- How about a tequila?

386
00:41:38,572 --> 00:41:41,644
Hi, Rick.

387
00:41:41,812 --> 00:41:44,451
That'll be a good one.

388
00:41:44,612 --> 00:41:49,242
- Glad you accepted my invitation.
- Steven invited me.

389
00:41:49,412 --> 00:41:52,484
He's having a super time.

390
00:41:54,732 --> 00:42:00,364
He's changing. You'll have to learn
to live with that.

391
00:42:02,252 --> 00:42:08,361
I don't know what your story is,
but I'm going to find out.

392
00:42:08,532 --> 00:42:15,370
Don't dig too deep. You might
get burned by the molten lava.

393
00:42:16,412 --> 00:42:19,848
I'm out of here.

394
00:42:26,132 --> 00:42:29,044
Thank you.

395
00:42:30,852 --> 00:42:35,721
The soothing sounds of Raoul,
ladies and gentlemen.

396
00:42:35,892 --> 00:42:40,124
- You had honey in your voice.
- Do a song for us.

397
00:42:40,292 --> 00:42:43,568
No, I couldn't.

398
00:42:43,732 --> 00:42:47,566
All right, already!

399
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:50,690
I fought the law, and the law won.

400
00:42:52,372 --> 00:42:57,366
Jefferson Airplane performed
this song in "Gimme Shelter", ...

401
00:42:57,532 --> 00:43:02,526
A film about how the Hell's Angels
had their way at a Stones concert.

402
00:43:02,692 --> 00:43:06,082
Tonight ... it's my turn.

403
00:43:34,172 --> 00:43:41,089
- What do you do?
- Can we talk in the other room?

404
00:45:00,212 --> 00:45:04,000
We just had a baby born
at the party.

405
00:45:04,172 --> 00:45:08,404
We need an ambulance
over by the scaffolding.

406
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:11,882
Shut the door!

407
00:45:26,412 --> 00:45:32,647
It's the summer of love, baby.
Let's leave these two alone.

408
00:45:32,812 --> 00:45:36,691
Smile!
That's going to be a good one.

409
00:45:51,812 --> 00:45:56,044
Good morning,
and how are we today?

410
00:45:56,212 --> 00:46:00,763
I borrowed this sweatshirt.
Bacon and eggs, coming up.

411
00:46:00,932 --> 00:46:06,131
- Where did Heather go?
- She left early this morning.

412
00:46:06,292 --> 00:46:09,284
You cad.

413
00:46:10,372 --> 00:46:16,129
- What a night. Just what I needed.
- I'll tell you something.

414
00:46:16,292 --> 00:46:20,126
You look like a new man.

415
00:46:20,292 --> 00:46:26,208
I was getting so used to rejection.
I really liked her.

416
00:46:26,372 --> 00:46:30,331
It was my treat.

417
00:46:31,172 --> 00:46:38,248
- What do you mean?
- You can buy next time.

418
00:46:39,692 --> 00:46:45,881
- Don't let your eggs get cold.
- Buy what?

419
00:46:46,052 --> 00:46:52,048
What do you mean, buy what?
The women.

420
00:46:52,212 --> 00:46:56,728
Do you mean
that Heather is a prostitute?

421
00:46:56,892 --> 00:47:01,647
Of course. We couldn't get
a woman like that without paying.

422
00:47:01,812 --> 00:47:04,690
This can't be happening.

423
00:47:04,852 --> 00:47:13,647
It's okay. She's totally clean.
I checked her out about a week ago.

424
00:47:13,812 --> 00:47:20,365
To make sure she was good. And I'm
healthy as a horse ... Not a drip.

425
00:47:21,612 --> 00:47:27,801
- Would you like some juice?
- You're kidding. She's your friend.

426
00:47:27,972 --> 00:47:32,648
- I wish I had friends like that.
- Get out of my house!

427
00:47:32,812 --> 00:47:37,203
She was a working girl,
but she liked you.

428
00:47:37,372 --> 00:47:40,887
You might even have got a freebie.

429
00:47:41,052 --> 00:47:46,001
I don't ever want to see you again.
Robin will never forgive me.

430
00:47:46,172 --> 00:47:49,801
Don't tell her.
I'll help you get her back.

431
00:47:49,972 --> 00:47:54,011
I want you out of my apartment.
And get this stuff out of here.

432
00:47:54,172 --> 00:47:58,927
Why are you doing this?
You're sabotaging yourself.

433
00:47:59,092 --> 00:48:01,526
Out! Now!

434
00:48:01,692 --> 00:48:05,241
Everything was going so well.

435
00:48:05,412 --> 00:48:09,325
I made you breakfast,
and we were eating ...

436
00:48:09,492 --> 00:48:11,767
Out!

437
00:48:11,932 --> 00:48:16,642
I'll fix this.
I can make it cool again.

438
00:48:16,812 --> 00:48:19,610
This is just a speed bump!

439
00:48:23,892 --> 00:48:27,885
- May I help you?
- No. I'm meeting someone here.

440
00:48:40,172 --> 00:48:43,960
I apologize about last night.
I came home and I just fell asleep.

441
00:48:53,772 --> 00:48:57,082
Most appreciated.

442
00:48:57,252 --> 00:49:02,485
Gail tells me
you're coming out of a relationship.

443
00:49:02,652 --> 00:49:07,965
- We're in a holding pattern.
- A holding pattern?

444
00:49:08,132 --> 00:49:12,045
You need to come down and refuel.

445
00:49:13,612 --> 00:49:15,807
You're sexy.

446
00:49:20,732 --> 00:49:25,601
You've been working hard.
Take a break.

447
00:49:32,092 --> 00:49:35,448
Excuse me.
What's the story with our chicken?

448
00:49:35,612 --> 00:49:42,563
Have the eggs had a chance to hatch?
Maybe you can go check on it for me.

449
00:49:43,372 --> 00:49:45,840
I'm sorry to put you out.

450
00:49:46,012 --> 00:49:48,480
Unbelievable.

451
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:52,645
I'm hysterical now.
What were we talking about?

452
00:49:52,812 --> 00:50:00,446
- What's your job like?
- It's a little crazy right now ...

453
00:50:00,612 --> 00:50:07,723
Wait. I need to use the head.
I want to find out about your job.

454
00:50:07,892 --> 00:50:10,360
What's with the chicken?

455
00:50:16,212 --> 00:50:19,443
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

456
00:50:19,612 --> 00:50:22,490
- Good evening, sir.
- Hey, stretch.

457
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:27,772
- Pleasant night, isn't it?
- Yeah, not too bad.

458
00:50:27,932 --> 00:50:35,122
The weather is always nice in here.
The winters are remarkably mild!

459
00:50:39,692 --> 00:50:45,449
- if you need anything, let me know!
- I got it under control!

460
00:50:45,612 --> 00:50:49,127
- Unbelievable.
- It's no trouble.

461
00:50:49,292 --> 00:50:52,204
What is your ..?

462
00:50:52,372 --> 00:50:56,763
People rarely take advantage of
my services. I'll help you wash up.

463
00:50:56,932 --> 00:50:59,685
Cleanliness is next to godliness.

464
00:51:03,452 --> 00:51:06,762
You're on a big date.

465
00:51:07,572 --> 00:51:10,166
You'll need to look your best.

466
00:51:13,292 --> 00:51:18,446
That'll take care of the shine.
Now, let's pluck those eyebrows!

467
00:51:18,612 --> 00:51:22,048
She loves me, she loves me not.
She loves me ...

468
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:25,887
... she loves me not.

469
00:51:26,052 --> 00:51:29,567
A little Jose Eber ...

470
00:51:32,892 --> 00:51:35,087
A touch of Alfalfa ...

471
00:51:35,252 --> 00:51:38,881
We're ready to dry you off!

472
00:51:39,052 --> 00:51:43,284
Right into the buckle.
That's got to hurt!

473
00:51:46,732 --> 00:51:49,769
Suck the air.

474
00:51:49,932 --> 00:51:53,368
You look just like Dizzy Gillespie.

475
00:52:06,252 --> 00:52:11,246
Don't worry about the tip.
But I've got one for you.

476
00:52:11,412 --> 00:52:15,769
Stay away from Robin.
She's taken.

477
00:52:23,212 --> 00:52:28,969
<i>A man was beaten in a restroom</i>
<i>by a bathroom attendant.</i>

478
00:52:29,132 --> 00:52:36,812
<i>The victim is unable to speak, but</i>
<i>witnesses described the assailant.</i>

479
00:52:36,972 --> 00:52:40,965
<i>Tonight on UPN: The trial</i>
<i>that has captured the nation.</i>

480
00:52:41,132 --> 00:52:46,286
<i>Everyone awaits the verdict,</i>
<i>but we're showing the movie now.</i>

481
00:52:46,452 --> 00:52:50,047
<i>- Cry - baby.</i>
<i>- I love you.</i>

482
00:52:50,212 --> 00:52:55,161
<i>- No, Sammy!</i>
<i>- Look who's crying now.</i>

483
00:52:55,332 --> 00:53:01,168
<i>Eric Roberts is Sam and Stan Sweet</i>
<i>in 'Brother Sweet Brother'.</i>

484
00:53:01,332 --> 00:53:03,641
<i>Parental discretion advised.</i>

485
00:53:15,092 --> 00:53:19,449
- Who is it?
- It's the cable guy!

486
00:53:19,612 --> 00:53:22,843
My cable's fine.

487
00:53:23,012 --> 00:53:28,325
I have an upgrade order
for one Robin Harris.

488
00:53:28,492 --> 00:53:32,246
I didn't order that.

489
00:53:33,772 --> 00:53:37,128
I guess you have a secret admirer.

490
00:53:40,212 --> 00:53:44,046
- ls it a man named Steven?
- I can't say.

491
00:53:44,212 --> 00:53:48,603
I promised Steven I wouldn't say.
Oh, look what I've done.

492
00:53:48,772 --> 00:53:52,651
- You didn't hear it from me.
- Hold on.

493
00:54:12,092 --> 00:54:16,483
<i>- Male witches are the worst kind.</i>
<i>- He's not a witch.</i>

494
00:54:22,732 --> 00:54:26,691
That about does it.
My work is done.

495
00:54:30,372 --> 00:54:34,160
That was hot up there.

496
00:54:36,612 --> 00:54:41,083
- Are you a friend of Steven's?
- I'm proud to say that I am.

497
00:54:41,252 --> 00:54:45,530
I recently installed his cable
and we just hit it off.

498
00:54:45,692 --> 00:54:50,243
- Are you guys going out a lot?
- Not really.

499
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:53,802
That guy is devoted to you.

500
00:54:53,972 --> 00:54:57,567
I shouldn't be telling you this ...

501
00:54:57,732 --> 00:55:02,248
... but he thinks
you're the cat's pyjamas.

502
00:55:02,412 --> 00:55:05,529
Did he say that?

503
00:55:05,692 --> 00:55:11,483
Only every five minutes.
Frankly I'm sick of hearing it.

504
00:55:11,652 --> 00:55:14,644
He's a good man.

505
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:20,125
He mentioned
that you've had some problems.

506
00:55:20,292 --> 00:55:24,649
- It's a little complicated.
- Lt always is.

507
00:55:24,812 --> 00:55:28,202
I asked a woman to marry me once.

508
00:55:28,372 --> 00:55:34,527
She wanted to think about it.
We agreed to take some time apart.

509
00:55:34,692 --> 00:55:39,243
You know ...
give each other space.

510
00:55:42,212 --> 00:55:44,885
She's no longer with us.

511
00:55:46,972 --> 00:55:49,406
I'm sorry.

512
00:55:49,572 --> 00:55:55,283
Sometimes you don't know
what you've got till it's gone.

513
00:55:56,692 --> 00:56:02,847
Promise me you'll never
go bungee jumping in Mexico.

514
00:56:03,012 --> 00:56:06,925
- I promise.
- Anyway ...

515
00:56:07,092 --> 00:56:10,767
I've said too much.

516
00:56:12,492 --> 00:56:15,325
Thank you.

517
00:56:16,652 --> 00:56:20,884
Cherish him, Robin.
Every hair on his head.

518
00:56:26,932 --> 00:56:29,765
Excuse me.

519
00:56:29,932 --> 00:56:32,321
- Hello.
<i>- I love you.</i>

520
00:56:32,492 --> 00:56:36,371
Robin?
I love you, too.

521
00:56:36,532 --> 00:56:40,684
That was so sweet of you.

522
00:56:40,852 --> 00:56:44,686
<i>- You didn't have to do that.</i>
- I ... I wanted to.

523
00:56:44,852 --> 00:56:48,765
Giving me free cable. Only you
would do something like that.

524
00:56:52,292 --> 00:56:57,241
I wanted to do something for you,
but you needed space, so ...

525
00:56:57,412 --> 00:57:01,405
Let's not make any more rules.

526
00:57:01,572 --> 00:57:08,171
<i>- Call me later if you're around.</i>
- Sure, as soon as I get home.

527
00:57:08,332 --> 00:57:11,768
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye.

528
00:57:11,932 --> 00:57:17,609
- Are you ready to rock?
- The concert. Oh, Jesus.

529
00:57:17,772 --> 00:57:21,651
I think Robin and l
are getting back together.

530
00:57:21,812 --> 00:57:28,604
So you're blowing me off again.
I won't put up with it any more.

531
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:41,522
- Can't you ask someone else to go?
- Maybe I'll take <i>my</i> cable guy.

532
00:57:47,252 --> 00:57:50,961
I'll call you later ...

533
00:57:55,492 --> 00:57:59,929
Pretty smooth work.
I set them up, you knock them down.

534
00:58:00,812 --> 00:58:06,921
- What?
- Robin. I got her back for you.

535
00:58:07,092 --> 00:58:11,483
- How do you know about us?
- Free cable's an aphrodisiac.

536
00:58:11,652 --> 00:58:17,488
- Don't mess around with my life.
- I wanted to make things up to you.

537
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:22,931
Do you want to catch a flick?

538
00:58:27,252 --> 00:58:31,803
I appreciate
you helping me out with Robin.

539
00:58:31,972 --> 00:58:39,287
Now I'll have to work extra hard
not to screw things up again.

540
00:58:39,452 --> 00:58:47,450
You're a nice guy, but I just
don't have time for a new friend.

541
00:58:50,252 --> 00:58:57,010
- What are you trying to say?
- I don't want to be your friend.

542
00:58:59,372 --> 00:59:04,207
I appreciate your honesty.
You're a straight shooter.

543
00:59:05,212 --> 00:59:11,003
- So you're all right?
- I'm a big boy.

544
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:15,131
It's no big deal.
Whatever.

545
00:59:18,412 --> 00:59:24,931
- You're sure?
- Uh-huh. I'm fine.

546
00:59:42,532 --> 00:59:46,571
- Robin Harris.
<i>- Hey, it's Chip Douglas.</i>

547
00:59:46,732 --> 00:59:52,443
- Chip Douglas?
<i>- The cable guy.</i>

548
00:59:52,612 --> 00:59:59,802
- What's up?
- I'm worried about Steven.

549
00:59:59,972 --> 01:00:06,320
<i>- What is it?</i>
- He doesn't seem like himself.

550
01:00:06,492 --> 01:00:12,124
- Have you noticed anything?
- No. Things are going really well.

551
01:00:12,292 --> 01:00:18,003
Good.
That makes me feel better.

552
01:00:18,172 --> 01:00:24,566
<i>- Should I be worried?</i>
- No. Maybe I'm being too nervous.

553
01:00:26,772 --> 01:00:30,526
Let's just keep our eyes open.

554
01:00:31,812 --> 01:00:34,610
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye-bye.

555
01:00:35,972 --> 01:00:39,521
Stevie, you did it, man.

556
01:00:39,692 --> 01:00:44,129
You put our cajones on the table
and you slam-dunked it.

557
01:00:44,292 --> 01:00:47,409
Way to go. Now they'll probably
give him <i>my</i> job.

558
01:00:47,572 --> 01:00:53,249
- On to the next order of business.
- Steven, I need to talk to you.

559
01:00:54,852 --> 01:00:58,925
We have to find an architect.

560
01:00:59,092 --> 01:01:02,767
- I need to talk to you.
- Lt shall wait.

561
01:01:02,932 --> 01:01:09,326
- ls there a Steven Kovacs here?
- Yeah. What's the problem?

562
01:01:09,492 --> 01:01:13,371
You're under arrest
for receiving stolen property.

563
01:01:13,532 --> 01:01:18,731
- I don't know anything about this.
- Do not speak until spoken to.

564
01:01:18,892 --> 01:01:23,647
You have the right to remain silent.

565
01:01:23,812 --> 01:01:28,010
- You have the right to an attorney.
- I didn't accept any stolen goods.

566
01:01:28,172 --> 01:01:32,609
<i>Deluxe karaoke machine.</i>
<i>Big - screen TV ...</i>

567
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:35,411
<i>Cream his pants ...</i>

568
01:01:42,492 --> 01:01:45,450
I can't believe you did this.

569
01:01:45,612 --> 01:01:51,801
He gave you a big-screen TV
and a hi-fi system as a present?

570
01:01:51,972 --> 01:01:55,487
- I swear it's true.
- Why would you accept such gifts?

571
01:01:55,652 --> 01:02:01,488
- I don't know.
- What's going on? Are you on pot?

572
01:02:01,652 --> 01:02:05,440
I didn't do anything!
Just call my cable guy.

573
01:02:05,612 --> 01:02:11,130
Nobody named Chip Douglas
works for the cable company.

574
01:02:11,292 --> 01:02:15,649
- This can't be happening.
- It's killing your mother.

575
01:02:15,812 --> 01:02:20,727
- When can you get me out?
- There'll be no bail hearing today.

576
01:02:20,892 --> 01:02:24,089
You have to spend the weekend here.

577
01:02:24,252 --> 01:02:27,210
Look at the pretty boy!

578
01:02:30,452 --> 01:02:35,367
They call me the pumper.
I'll be your friend.

579
01:02:35,532 --> 01:02:38,524
Lock down!

580
01:02:47,452 --> 01:02:50,967
You hear anything?

581
01:02:52,892 --> 01:02:55,690
I came as soon as I could.

582
01:02:55,852 --> 01:03:00,130
- What's your real name?
- Larry Tate. That's not important.

583
01:03:00,292 --> 01:03:05,161
We have to get you out of here.
I was watching Court TV.

584
01:03:05,332 --> 01:03:09,962
I'll talk to the judge.
I'll put the system on trial!

585
01:03:10,132 --> 01:03:14,330
- Why are you doing this to me?
- You did this to you.

586
01:03:14,492 --> 01:03:19,771
- You set me up.
- No. I taught you a lesson.

587
01:03:19,932 --> 01:03:24,687
I can be your friend or your enemy.
You seem to prefer the latter.

588
01:03:24,852 --> 01:03:27,082
I'm just here to comfort you.

589
01:03:29,252 --> 01:03:33,484
Touch it.
You need human contact.

590
01:03:33,652 --> 01:03:36,610
I will not touch it.

591
01:03:38,532 --> 01:03:43,048
- What are you doing?
- I know how you're feeling!

592
01:03:43,212 --> 01:03:48,206
- Don't do that.
- I'm here for you!

593
01:03:49,412 --> 01:03:53,325
Don't do that! You'll get me killed!

594
01:03:53,692 --> 01:03:57,287
Oh, Billy.

595
01:04:04,092 --> 01:04:06,811
I'm just messing with you.

596
01:04:06,972 --> 01:04:11,090
Remember "Midnight Express"?
Oliver Stone won an Academy Award.

597
01:04:11,252 --> 01:04:13,482
Awesome scene.

598
01:04:13,652 --> 01:04:17,531
This is the man who framed me!

599
01:04:17,692 --> 01:04:21,446
Hey Bernie,
how's that sports package?

600
01:04:24,412 --> 01:04:31,170
Don't worry about Robin.
I'll take care of her.

601
01:04:31,892 --> 01:04:37,489
- if you go near her, I'll kill you.
- That's it. Let's go!

602
01:04:39,532 --> 01:04:45,289
This concludes our broadcast day.
Click.

603
01:04:45,452 --> 01:04:49,331
- You've been blowing me off.
- This guy's doing a number on me.

604
01:04:49,492 --> 01:04:53,007
- I told you to stay away from him.
- You said I could get free cable.

605
01:04:53,172 --> 01:04:56,847
Did I tell you
to have a karaoke jam with him?

606
01:04:57,012 --> 01:05:00,800
I'm out on bail.

607
01:05:03,892 --> 01:05:08,124
I'll see if I can track him down.
What was his name?

608
01:05:08,292 --> 01:05:13,161
Larry Tate. But at first he said
his name was Chip Douglas.

609
01:05:13,332 --> 01:05:17,245
Chip Douglas?
That sounds familiar.

610
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:20,966
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

611
01:05:21,132 --> 01:05:25,330
- You're not fine.
- I just want to get this over with.

612
01:05:25,492 --> 01:05:27,926
I hate visiting my parents.

613
01:05:29,612 --> 01:05:35,244
Ls this guy cool?
Just joking. Come in, you psycho.

614
01:05:35,892 --> 01:05:40,602
- What is he doing here?
- I invited him.

615
01:05:40,772 --> 01:05:43,764
- I invited him at lunch.
- At lunch?

616
01:05:43,932 --> 01:05:48,323
- You look great.
- And you are a vision.

617
01:05:48,492 --> 01:05:53,771
- You look rested.
- Come here.

618
01:05:54,292 --> 01:05:59,889
- What's wrong? You seem weird.
- You had me sent to jail.

619
01:06:00,052 --> 01:06:04,921
- I should take you to the police.
- You can if you like.

620
01:06:05,092 --> 01:06:08,721
But I'd hate
to have to show Robin this.

621
01:06:09,252 --> 01:06:14,372
- Bastard!
- Let's just have a good time.

622
01:06:16,252 --> 01:06:22,043
Steven is carrying his battle axe
and chasing me ...

623
01:06:22,212 --> 01:06:26,603
So I say, "Hey, it's just a show!"

624
01:06:28,972 --> 01:06:34,763
- He takes things too seriously.
- The guy almost took my head off.

625
01:06:40,332 --> 01:06:45,087
Did never played Porno Password?
It's the adult version of the show.

626
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:49,803
Robin, you're on my team.
Steven ... you're with Mom.

627
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:52,486
You're the judges.

628
01:06:52,652 --> 01:06:55,166
Pick a word.

629
01:07:05,052 --> 01:07:08,647
The password is ...

630
01:07:08,812 --> 01:07:11,565
Vagina.

631
01:07:11,732 --> 01:07:15,611
- I really don't want to play.
- Come on, Steven.

632
01:07:18,572 --> 01:07:21,405
Woman.

633
01:07:21,572 --> 01:07:24,769
- Woman.
- Man?

634
01:07:28,972 --> 01:07:32,726
Penis.

635
01:07:34,172 --> 01:07:37,209
Penis.

636
01:07:39,252 --> 01:07:42,164
- Penis.
- Vagina.

637
01:07:45,212 --> 01:07:48,443
She got vagina!

638
01:07:48,612 --> 01:07:53,766
- I would have said "schlong".
- Now we're starting to get this!

639
01:08:01,612 --> 01:08:05,844
The password is ...

640
01:08:07,332 --> 01:08:10,210
Nipple.

641
01:08:10,372 --> 01:08:13,728
- Can I pass?
- Don't be a stick in the mud!

642
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:19,084
Breast.

643
01:08:19,252 --> 01:08:21,925
Breast.

644
01:08:22,092 --> 01:08:25,004
Tit?

645
01:08:28,092 --> 01:08:31,243
Remember his clue.

646
01:08:31,892 --> 01:08:35,009
Hard.

647
01:08:37,492 --> 01:08:42,202
- Erection?
- No. But thanks for noticing.

648
01:08:44,492 --> 01:08:49,043
- Your turn!
- Center.

649
01:08:50,932 --> 01:08:53,890
Center.

650
01:08:55,052 --> 01:08:58,727
- Center!
- Nipple?

651
01:08:58,892 --> 01:09:02,407
- She got it!
- Mom.

652
01:09:08,372 --> 01:09:12,001
The password is ...

653
01:09:12,172 --> 01:09:15,960
I'm not sure how to say this.

654
01:09:16,132 --> 01:09:19,249
That little thing ...

655
01:09:19,412 --> 01:09:23,564
- I can't say that to my mother.
- She can handle it.

656
01:09:23,732 --> 01:09:27,122
I won't do it. I've had enough!

657
01:09:27,292 --> 01:09:32,810
- It's just skin, Steven.
- I don't want to do it any more!

658
01:09:32,972 --> 01:09:37,727
- You're overreacting.
- No! He's fooling you all.

659
01:09:37,892 --> 01:09:44,127
- He's a lunatic and a felon.
- Everybody just relax.

660
01:09:44,292 --> 01:09:49,207
- We knew this would happen.
- Nothing is happening!

661
01:09:49,372 --> 01:09:54,082
This is a safe place.
You're with people who love you.

662
01:09:54,252 --> 01:09:58,962
- We love you.
- I hate you! Get out of my life!

663
01:09:59,132 --> 01:10:04,126
- He's angry with me. I should go.
- No.

664
01:10:04,292 --> 01:10:08,524
- You are being an asshole.
- Do you see what's happening?

665
01:10:08,692 --> 01:10:12,480
- You're hitting bottom.
- Stay away.

666
01:10:12,652 --> 01:10:17,442
This is where the healing begins.
Come on.

667
01:10:18,372 --> 01:10:23,810
Robin showed me her birthmark.
It's very sexy.

668
01:10:28,932 --> 01:10:32,083
What the hell is wrong with you?

669
01:10:34,252 --> 01:10:39,201
Thanks for the delightful evening.
I guess I'll be leaving now.

670
01:10:46,852 --> 01:10:52,722
I forgive you. I only hope
my neurologist will feel the same.

671
01:11:02,572 --> 01:11:02,812
- Did anybody notice I'm late?
- You've been here for an hour.

672
01:11:02,813 --> 01:11:06,885
- Did anybody notice I'm late?
- You've been here for an hour.

673
01:11:08,572 --> 01:11:13,771
HELLO STEVEN
l'VE GOT A PRESENT FOR YOU

674
01:11:18,572 --> 01:11:23,248
<i>- How's Hal?</i>
<i>- The man has no vision.</i>

675
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:29,567
<i>It's like working for Mr. Magoo.</i>
<i>If only someone would dump him.</i>

676
01:11:29,732 --> 01:11:33,441
<i>And those hair plugs ...</i>

677
01:11:33,612 --> 01:11:37,810
<i>- Hair plugs. Hair plugs ...</i>
- Oh, shit.

678
01:11:37,972 --> 01:11:43,365
<i>He's so pathetic.</i>
<i>I think I hate him. Hate him ...</i>

679
01:11:51,892 --> 01:11:55,123
<i>If only someone would dump him.</i>

680
01:12:02,212 --> 01:12:05,648
I ... I don't hate you.

681
01:12:05,812 --> 01:12:10,169
<i>- Those hair plugs.</i>
- Get out!

682
01:12:35,772 --> 01:12:38,764
Chip!

683
01:12:39,932 --> 01:12:42,844
This isn't funny!

684
01:12:44,092 --> 01:12:47,368
Where are you?

685
01:12:50,972 --> 01:12:54,760
If you build it, he will come.

686
01:13:10,092 --> 01:13:14,085
- Hello?
- Bingo! "My Three Sons".

687
01:13:14,252 --> 01:13:19,804
- Chip and Ernie Douglas.
- I have a list of ex-cable men.

688
01:13:19,972 --> 01:13:22,088
Murray Slaughter.

689
01:13:22,252 --> 01:13:24,846
<i>George Jetson. Jean Luc Picard.</i>

690
01:13:25,012 --> 01:13:29,688
- Someone called the Big Ragoo.
- Carmine, from "Laverne & Shirley".

691
01:13:29,852 --> 01:13:37,122
<i>Anyway, the cable company in town</i>
<i>fired a guy six months ago.</i>

692
01:13:37,292 --> 01:13:43,367
His boss was Larry Tate,
from a show called "Bewitched".

693
01:13:43,532 --> 01:13:47,889
- He's not with the cable company?
- Yahtzee!

694
01:13:48,812 --> 01:13:55,888
<i>They fired him for stalking</i>
<i>customers. You better lock up tight.</i>

695
01:13:56,052 --> 01:14:01,251
<i>In the Sam Sweet Trial,</i>
<i>the jury is close to a verdict.</i>

696
01:14:01,412 --> 01:14:06,440
<i>They will continue deliberating</i>
<i>into the evening hours.</i>

697
01:14:06,612 --> 01:14:11,732
<i>The day started real nice,</i>
<i>but now the moisture is increasing.</i>

698
01:14:11,892 --> 01:14:15,202
<i>We see thunderstorms ...</i>

699
01:14:20,532 --> 01:14:23,285
<i>Cable guy!</i>

700
01:14:24,972 --> 01:14:27,645
<i>Cable guy!</i>

701
01:14:40,532 --> 01:14:43,842
Jesucristo!

702
01:14:44,492 --> 01:14:47,848
Cable guy!

703
01:15:10,612 --> 01:15:14,446
Okay, I'm going!

704
01:15:17,252 --> 01:15:20,847
See you! Bye.

705
01:15:35,892 --> 01:15:39,931
I just want to hang out!
No big deal!

706
01:16:02,292 --> 01:16:06,331
- Hello?
- We could have been blood brothers.

707
01:16:06,492 --> 01:16:11,122
<i>But you're too needy.</i>
<i>It's a real turn-off. Ask Robin.</i>

708
01:16:11,292 --> 01:16:14,762
The cable company fired you.

709
01:16:14,932 --> 01:16:19,289
Hold on.
I have a call waiting.

710
01:16:32,212 --> 01:16:35,966
- I know it's you.
- Sorry. Where was l?

711
01:16:36,132 --> 01:16:39,249
- Can't we work this out?
<i>- I wish we could.</i>

712
01:16:39,412 --> 01:16:46,124
- I'm just so tired, Steven.
- Where are you?

713
01:16:46,292 --> 01:16:53,243
L'd love to chat, but I'm
getting together with a lady friend.

714
01:16:54,092 --> 01:16:59,086
- You might know her.
- Stay away from her!

715
01:17:04,532 --> 01:17:11,643
- Robin!
- She just left with the cable guy!

716
01:17:11,812 --> 01:17:14,690
Where were they going?

717
01:17:14,852 --> 01:17:20,370
I heard him say they were taking
a ride on the information highway.

718
01:17:25,572 --> 01:17:29,201
The future is now!

719
01:17:29,372 --> 01:17:34,162
Soon every home will integrate their
television, phone and computer!

720
01:17:34,332 --> 01:17:40,009
You'll be able to visit the Louvre,
or watch female mud wrestling.

721
01:17:40,172 --> 01:17:46,611
You can shop from your home, or play
video games with someone in Vietnam.

722
01:17:51,452 --> 01:17:54,649
I want to go home now.
I'm worried about Steven.

723
01:18:20,532 --> 01:18:24,161
- Help!
- Robin!

724
01:18:25,652 --> 01:18:28,212
Where are you?

725
01:18:28,372 --> 01:18:32,524
- Steven!
- I'm coming!

726
01:18:38,332 --> 01:18:42,120
- Help me!
- Hang on!

727
01:18:51,012 --> 01:18:56,564
- Steven, look out!
- Yes, Steven! Look out!

728
01:19:07,652 --> 01:19:13,966
"Dry land is not a myth!"
Kevin Costner, "Waterworld".

729
01:19:14,132 --> 01:19:19,843
- Leave him alone!
- I saw that movie six times!

730
01:19:21,972 --> 01:19:25,521
Isn't it funny
that we ended up like this?

731
01:19:33,292 --> 01:19:37,888
You'll have to do
better than that, Steven.

732
01:19:42,412 --> 01:19:45,961
My lisp is gone!

733
01:19:47,132 --> 01:19:50,169
You stupid son-of-a-bitch.

734
01:19:52,572 --> 01:19:57,168
- Stop it! Steven!
- I'm coming!

735
01:20:06,292 --> 01:20:11,764
The trouble with real life is,
there's no danger music.

736
01:20:23,372 --> 01:20:27,206
Nice jump, Spiderman!

737
01:20:30,652 --> 01:20:35,931
Steven called the fuzz!

738
01:20:36,092 --> 01:20:39,641
Bad boys, what you gonna do?

739
01:20:40,932 --> 01:20:44,527
Skooch over just a tad.

740
01:20:52,212 --> 01:20:54,965
Here comes our hero.

741
01:20:55,132 --> 01:20:59,489
- It didn't have to be this way.
- What are you planning to do?

742
01:20:59,652 --> 01:21:06,967
I don't really have a plan.
I'm going moment to moment now.

743
01:21:07,132 --> 01:21:10,761
You have to admit,
it's a cool place for an ending.

744
01:21:10,932 --> 01:21:14,083
- An ending to what?
- It's like "Golden Eye".

745
01:21:14,252 --> 01:21:20,122
This isn't a movie!
This is reality!

746
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:24,843
<i>This is the police! You're</i>
<i>trespassing in a restricted area!</i>

747
01:21:31,412 --> 01:21:34,882
I just wanted to be your friend ...

748
01:21:35,052 --> 01:21:38,681
... but I screwed it up.

749
01:21:39,532 --> 01:21:45,482
<i>- You are in a high - voltage area!</i>
- What's that?

750
01:21:47,052 --> 01:21:49,885
Come again?

751
01:21:51,692 --> 01:21:57,801
You want me to quiet down
and chill out in front of the TV?

752
01:22:01,212 --> 01:22:04,409
You were never there for me,
were you, Mother?

753
01:22:08,052 --> 01:22:12,011
You expected Mike and Carol Brady
to raise me.

754
01:22:12,172 --> 01:22:19,408
I'm the bastard son of Claire
Huxtable! I'm the lost Cunningham!

755
01:22:20,012 --> 01:22:26,531
I learned the facts of life ...
from watching "The Facts of Life"!

756
01:22:36,892 --> 01:22:40,248
That's it.

757
01:22:43,132 --> 01:22:46,408
That's what I have to do!

758
01:22:47,372 --> 01:22:50,921
No. Don't do that!

759
01:22:51,092 --> 01:22:55,529
- Let's go out and have a Heineken.
- Yeah!

760
01:22:55,692 --> 01:22:58,684
I'm not thirsty any more.

761
01:22:59,252 --> 01:23:02,562
See ya.

762
01:23:09,972 --> 01:23:13,169
You're not going anywhere!

763
01:23:13,332 --> 01:23:18,406
It's okay!
I understand my purpose now!

764
01:23:18,572 --> 01:23:22,451
Don't do this. You just need help.
We all get lonely.

765
01:23:22,612 --> 01:23:28,448
But I get really lonely.
Look at me!

766
01:23:31,772 --> 01:23:39,122
- I'll be your pal. Just come on up!
- No. It's too late for me.

767
01:23:39,892 --> 01:23:45,250
But there are a lot of cable boys
and girls who still have a chance!

768
01:23:45,892 --> 01:23:49,441
Don't you understand, Steven?

769
01:23:56,692 --> 01:24:01,447
Somebody has to kill the babysitter.

770
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:18,766
<i>This is the moment we've been</i>
<i>waiting for. The jury is ready ...</i>

771
01:24:18,932 --> 01:24:23,210
<i>The jury has notified the judge</i>
<i>that they've reached a verdict.</i>

772
01:24:33,972 --> 01:24:38,284
<i>- The moment of truth ...</i>
<i>- Jacob Sweet has been found ...</i>

773
01:24:54,412 --> 01:24:56,687
Help.

774
01:25:00,772 --> 01:25:03,605
Preferred customer, my ass!

775
01:25:46,412 --> 01:25:51,440
Squad 51 . Man down.
Possible back injury.

776
01:25:53,972 --> 01:25:58,807
We'll need an lV with D-5-W.

777
01:25:58,972 --> 01:26:02,328
Check vital signs.

778
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:06,564
Prepare to defibrillate!

779
01:26:15,812 --> 01:26:18,406
Wait!

780
01:26:23,892 --> 01:26:26,884
You two will be just fine.

781
01:26:27,052 --> 01:26:31,523
Take care of him, Robin.
He's good people.

782
01:26:31,692 --> 01:26:35,401
You never told me your real name.

783
01:26:35,572 --> 01:26:39,326
You still want to know my name?

784
01:26:43,892 --> 01:26:48,920
It's ... Ricardo.

785
01:26:49,452 --> 01:26:52,762
Ricky Ricardo.

786
01:27:02,532 --> 01:27:06,081
I'm just messing with you.

787
01:27:25,412 --> 01:27:28,609
Let's go home.

788
01:27:34,012 --> 01:27:38,688
Hang in there, pal!
You're going to make it, buddy!

789
01:27:55,412 --> 01:28:00,964
- Am I really your buddy?
- Yeah, sure you are!
