484
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:02,454
You sew a chain of people
from asshole to mouth hole.

485
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:05,064
You share the same
digestive system.

486

Check it out.

487
00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:08,797
We shit brothers! Oh!

488
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:10,420
I was the middle.

489
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:11,803
No!

490
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:13,155
What the fuck? Fuck!

491
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:15,825
Why would we do that fucking...
That's disgusting!

492
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:18,262
You have really potty mouth.

493
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:20,273
You get it? Potty mouth!

494
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:22,186
Because your mouth was potty.

496
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:28,782
Just let it out, man.
(LAUGHING)

497
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:32,783
Wait, hold on. I was in the
front, so I didn't eat any shit?

498
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:35,618
Nope. You were total
party pooper.

499
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:37,156
Literally.

500
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:39,992
(CHUCKLING)
Well, that's a relief, huh?

501
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:41,726

It's getting really late.

503

You know what they say,

504
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:48,466
early to bed, early
to Human Centipede.

505
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:50,610
I gotta go Human Centipede
with the Olsen twins.

506

They've done it before.

Let's find a place to sleep,

Oh, Jesus!

00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:04,517
I didn't eat corn.

511
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:05,899
Yeah, I did.

00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,552
Shit, human shit inside me.

514
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:19,073
Hey, man, we've all been there.

515
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:21,331
Really?

516
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:23,518
Fuck, no, I've never been there.

517
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:25,520
It's the most disgusting
thing I've ever heard.

518

(CRYING)
It is real gross.

519
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:29,106
Hey, shit-for-breath,
be quiet for a second.

520
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:31,888
Look over there. Someone's
got a fire going.

521
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:33,069
That's dumb.

522
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,213
Yup.

523
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:38,658
MAN: I appreciate the spirited
conversation, gentlemen,

524
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:40,535
but we all know
there's no debate.

525
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:43,204
I am the weirdest
of all the Depps.

526
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:45,724
I mean, for fuck's
sake, I'm a pirate

527
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:48,186

like a bloody poof.

528
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:52,232
And what of you there, top hat?

529
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:55,275
Well, I do have my fair share
of psychological issues.

530
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,135
My speech patterns mirror
those of sexual molesters.

531
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:00,917
I keep a bunch of
dwarves as my slaves.

532
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:04,934
And I masturbate
in the chocolate.

533
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:06,102
(GIGGLES)

534
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:08,422
Every single batch.

535
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:10,466
I think I might puke.

00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:24,179
Nice work, Tonto.

Say good night, weirdos.

539
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:28,124
A bloody smoke signal!

You fucked us, you
bloody Native!

541
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:32,336
Tonto sick of white man.

542
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:34,158
Yes, but we're all Depps, mate!

543
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,454
Tonto especially sick of Depps.

544
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:39,532
Are you gonna rape
and murder us?

545
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:42,454
TEDDY: Keep it in your
pants, Scissorhands.

Me next! Me next!

547
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:56,094
If you don't mind, I prefer
it in a chocolate factory.

548
00:29:01,617 --> 00:29:02,927
That's brutal.

549
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:05,979
Now that's what I
call a deep throat.

550
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:09,874
That means a dozen gone in the
first eight hours, Stephen A.,

551
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:13,238
and I think I smell
an alliance forming.

552
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:16,278
What the fuck do you
mean, an alliance?

553
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:17,988
If it's supposed to be
every man for themself,

554
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:19,842
they ain't gonna create
no fucking alliance.

555
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:21,636
They're gonna be out there
killing each other.

556
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:24,031
That don't make
no goddamn sense!

557
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:26,992
I know. I can barely keep myself
from killing you, Stephen A.

558
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:28,707
Can't fault you there.

Don't stay here, don't stay
here, don't stay here.

Anyway, guys, I'm pooped. What say
we just stay here for the night?

565
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,346
ZACH: Do you guys think
there's a Chili's out here?

566
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:51,395
I'll settle for an Applebee's,
but it would be grudgingly.

567
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:54,502
What the fuck is he
doing with them?

568
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:57,880
I think he's looking for a reasonably
priced casual dining restaurant.

will murder your whole family

town you come from, you hear me?

00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:16,048
Okay, more fully loaded
potato skins for me then.

576
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:17,692
How about a bear claw?

577
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:19,714
Maybe a bun for the wiener?

All right, table for six, seven.

we fit the dress code.

guys will be fine.

No.

you a straight bitch.

But I'm good.

644
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:13,094
Hey, hey, hey, sure? You
don't look too good.

645
00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:14,701
I don't feel too good.

646
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:16,245
No, no, no, no! Bradley!

647
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:23,419
I'm coming for you!

648
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:25,731
You guys see that?

649
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:26,858
(SCREAMING)

650
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:28,442
Shit! Shit!

651
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:30,216
This chubba has
literally no swag.

652
00:34:31,488 --> 00:34:34,352
Hey! I was looking all
over for you guys!

653
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:42,164
(ALL GROANING)

654
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:44,000
BRADLEY: God, my face hurts.

655
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:46,794
Oh, I can feel my
heartbeat in my ears.

656
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:48,379
It's throbbing.
It's really loud.

657
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,446
Hey. Does my head look weird?
It's so loud.

658
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:52,758
No.

659
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:54,911
But your body is super tiny.

660
00:34:56,972 --> 00:34:58,323
It is?

661
00:34:58,348 --> 00:35:00,453
Your body is super tiny, man.

662
00:35:00,726 --> 00:35:02,463
Do I look okay?

663
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:05,123
Yeah.

664
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:07,940
You're cool.

665
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:09,928
I am cool, thank you.

666
00:35:10,194 --> 00:35:12,678
This is napping
cool time for me.

667
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:14,137
(GROANS)

668
00:35:14,323 --> 00:35:16,843
This is a terrible pillow.

669
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,481
Sleep sounds good.

670
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:35,868
Hi.

671
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,826
I've missed you.

672
00:35:38,263 --> 00:35:40,534
I've missed you, too, Katnip.

673
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:42,754
I'm only 17.

674
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:44,227
What?

675
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:45,436
Nothing.

676
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:47,922
I have something to show you.

677
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:52,468
ED: Yes.

678
00:35:52,694 --> 00:35:53,886
Yes.

679
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:57,347
No!

680
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:00,928
Why?

681
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:04,389
Hey, are you having a
wet hallucination, Ed?

682
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:07,017
Yeah, you know, a
nocturnal emission?

683
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:10,646
God, just when I thought I
couldn't hate you any more.

684
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:14,340
Hey, ease up. We didn't
choose this way of life.

685
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,446
Yeah, it's no picnic.

686
00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:19,470
You know how hard it is
to motorboat yourself?

687
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:20,864
God, please don't do it.

688
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:25,211
This is the worst wet
dream of my life.

689
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:26,621
See?

690
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:28,797
Zach, how can you
even ruin boobs?

691
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:31,548
Hey, does my mouth
look like a nipple?

692
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:35,444
Uh...

693
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:37,052
It kinda does.

694
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,426
Okay, this is getting weird.
Maybe we should wake him up.

695
00:36:41,451 --> 00:36:42,910
Okay, okay, okay.

696
00:36:42,911 --> 00:36:44,304
On my count.

697
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:48,102
One, two, three!

698
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:49,893
BOTH: Boom!

699
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:51,145
Bearded boobies!

700
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:52,866
(SHOUTING)

701
00:36:57,634 --> 00:36:59,158
How long have we been out, man?

702
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:00,636
Couple days.

703
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:02,930
I've been licking your wounds.
What?

704
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:05,909
I've been watching you guys sleep,
nursing you back to health.

705
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:09,213
Scrotal touching was just
for medicinal purposes.

706
00:37:10,314 --> 00:37:13,774
We saw those Swagger Jackers
sting you, man. A lot.

707
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:15,715
Yeah, but their
venom has no effect

708
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:17,653
if you have no swagger to Jack.

709
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:19,594
Hold on a second.

710
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:22,259
What the hell were you
doing with that gang, man?

711
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:27,435
You were gonna
help them kill us?

712
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:31,083
You guys, I don't do
well with peer pressure.

713
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:33,521
I didn't really
want to murder you.

714
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,025
But you would have?

715
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:41,052
Oh, come on!

716
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:43,012
I'm sorry! I had a
moment of weakness!

717
00:37:43,013 --> 00:37:45,913
I nursed you back to health.
Don't you feel swaggy?

718
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:48,167
Yeah.

719
00:37:48,185 --> 00:37:49,459
Yeah.

720
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:51,631
I really do, actually.

721
00:37:52,147 --> 00:37:53,564
It's because of this.

722
00:37:53,565 --> 00:37:54,792
Swagger Balm.

723
00:37:58,028 --> 00:38:00,696
"Ingredients, aloe, palm oil,"

724
00:38:00,697 --> 00:38:03,301
"and Kanye West extract?"

725
00:38:03,408 --> 00:38:05,893
Tastes just like the real thing.

WOMAN: Hey, boys.

728
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:10,853
We thought we smelt
some swagger.

729
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:13,918
Puts the rocks down, buddy.

730
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:15,360
(WHOOPING)

731
00:38:15,546 --> 00:38:19,489
I just wanna get sloppy
drunk and slutty!

732
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:22,327
Way too late for
that, sweetheart.

733
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:24,178
I get the blondes.

734
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:25,323
Okay.

735
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:29,498
That's rich!

736
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:34,543
So then I divorced that asshole
and took half of everything.

737
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,543
That's how I got my lucky charm.

738
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:40,444
Is it that ring? It's lovely.

739
00:38:40,445 --> 00:38:42,446
I'm not talking about that.

740
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:43,906
I'm talking about

741
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:45,099
this.

742
00:38:45,576 --> 00:38:47,451
(LAUGHING)
Is that a fucking ball?

743
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:48,763
Neat!

744
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:55,102
I told you, when I took half of
everything, I meant half of everything.

745
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:57,938
You girls are such a treat.

746
00:38:57,963 --> 00:38:59,731
Great! Here's to good friends!

747
00:38:59,756 --> 00:39:01,067
And you two bitches.

748
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:04,614
Well, well, well,

749
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:07,114
if it isn't the popular girls.

750
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:09,576
Nice blood outfit, honey, but
that's worse than pleather.

751
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:12,460
What is that, O positive?

752
00:39:12,561 --> 00:39:14,145
Awful. So last season.

753
00:39:14,146 --> 00:39:15,271
What is that, gas?

You got that on my Gucci dress!

What are you doing?

756
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:21,044
Do you know how much this cost?

757
00:39:22,905 --> 00:39:24,906
Wait, I just wanna see
where this is going!

758
00:39:24,907 --> 00:39:26,394
Zach, let's go!

00:39:26,992 --> 00:39:28,260

760
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:29,559
No! No!

761
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:31,895

You wanted to see me,
President Snowbama?

765
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,121
Tell me, have you
ever been hungover?

766
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:55,250
Why, yes.

767
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:57,922
I'm actually hungover right now.

768
00:39:58,357 --> 00:40:00,841
Never pass out in a crowded bar.

769
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:04,641
Yes, they shaved a
dick on my face, Sir.

770
00:40:05,531 --> 00:40:09,308
These hungover contestants,
people seem to care about them.

771
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:12,537
Yes? Is that a bad thing, Sir?

772
00:40:12,538 --> 00:40:14,664
The Games are a distraction

773
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:17,208
so people won't notice
the crap we peddle out.

774
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:20,406
Sequels, remakes, spoofs.

775
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:24,824
When people start to
care, bad things happen.

776
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:26,235
Ratings go down,

777
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,447
beards get shaved.

778
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,660
I've got it under control, Sir.

779
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:43,470
It's a kitty cat.

Shit! Any one of these
Cannon blasts could be Doug.

00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:01,711
We don't even know
if he's still alive.

785
00:41:01,712 --> 00:41:04,338
Hey, I'm scared, too, but the one
thing that's not gonna get us

786
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:06,776
back to that gay wedding is
sitting here crying about it.

787
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:09,327
There should only be a
handful of contestants left.

788
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:11,322
We can do this, man.

789
00:41:11,346 --> 00:41:12,538
You guys.

790

Hey, since we're standing around
sharing things, I've got a doozy.

791
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:18,328
What the hell did you do, Zach?

792
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:20,605
You know the air fresheners
that I plugged in?

793
00:41:20,606 --> 00:41:22,190
Best thing you ever did.
They were delightful.

794
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:27,195
Well, it wasn't Lilac or Morning
Mist or Brazilian Breeze.

795
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:28,946
It was Midnight Berry.

796
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:30,803
What the shit is Midnight Berry?

797
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:33,932
From the novels. It's aromatic.

798
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:36,687
What's so bad about that?

799
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:39,192
Well, I didn't
finish my thought.

800
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:43,419
It's aromatic,
poisonous and lethal.

801
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,296
What the fuck is wrong with you?

802
00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:47,089
Are you kidding me?

803
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:51,052
I think you guys are getting Hung up on
the fact that it's poisonous and lethal.

804
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:52,909
They smell fresh.

00:51:08,944 --> 00:51:10,598
She's over there.

You've got the talking Jay!

973
00:51:14,992 --> 00:51:18,536
Sorry, Bradley, but this guy just
made me crap down your shirt.

974
00:51:18,537 --> 00:51:21,497
Everything he says is so foul!
Yeah, he says disgusting stuff.

975
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:22,623
Come on!

976
00:51:22,624 --> 00:51:25,310
Where are we going? Fuck.

Ooh.

978
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:40,291
Maybe I should tell her I'm...

Wow, yeah, this is not...

982
00:51:47,232 --> 00:51:49,717
This isn't pervy at all.
Yes, it is.

00:51:52,404 --> 00:51:54,723
Hey! Perverted ass cracker!

Um...

992

You know I'm 17, right?
La, la, la!

993
00:52:18,222 --> 00:52:20,389
What? I can't hear you! It
just got real loud in here!

994
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:21,582
Hey, guys. Hell.

Hi.

996
00:52:22,851 --> 00:52:24,244
No sign of Doug?

997
00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:25,662
Nope. Nothing.

998
00:52:27,606 --> 00:52:29,232
Wait a minute.

999
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:32,360
He came with your district. You were
the last one to see him at the arena.

1000
00:52:32,361 --> 00:52:35,011
Do you have any
idea where he went?

1001
00:52:36,698 --> 00:52:40,642
Well, do you feel
like telling us?

1002
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:45,557
Okay, I've had about enough of
this. Hey, hey, hey, come on!

1003
00:52:45,582 --> 00:52:48,067
That's like a triple hate crime.

Hey.

1005
00:52:50,254 --> 00:52:52,296
They're just looking
for their friend.

1006
00:52:52,297 --> 00:52:54,817
Do you want to tell them?
For me?

Yeah, anything, man.

1051
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:56,377
Which one's the pink and
which one's the stink?

1052
00:55:56,648 --> 00:55:58,441
Because they're both pinkish.

1053
00:55:58,442 --> 00:56:00,214
And they both stink.

1054

01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:02,476
What the fuck are you doing?

1134
01:00:02,477 --> 01:00:04,333
What Katnip would do.

(EXCLAIMS)

1136
01:00:06,315 --> 01:00:08,586
Okay, I'm good. Oh, shit.

1137
01:00:09,735 --> 01:00:11,306
God damn it.

1138
01:00:36,762 --> 01:00:37,953
What?

1139
01:00:41,266 --> 01:00:42,493
What?

1140
01:00:49,525 --> 01:00:50,716
Oh.

1141
01:00:52,736 --> 01:00:53,880
Hi.

1142
01:00:57,157 --> 01:00:59,642
You mind if I just
grab a weapon?

1143

(SCREAMS)

1144
01:01:13,465 --> 01:01:15,800
It's too bad you couldn't
help your friend.

1145
01:01:15,801 --> 01:01:17,426
A generic straight man.
What was his name?

1146
01:01:17,427 --> 01:01:18,619
Doug.

1147
01:01:18,762 --> 01:01:20,906
And he's not a straight man.

1148
01:01:20,931 --> 01:01:23,909
Well, he's probably long dead.

1149
01:01:23,934 --> 01:01:25,184
And soon,

1150
01:01:25,185 --> 01:01:28,215
you'll be long dead, too.

1151

(SCREAMING)

1152
01:01:31,108 --> 01:01:32,761
This is for threatening
my friend!

1153
01:01:32,943 --> 01:01:35,380
This is for being a bitch
to me in the woods!

1154
01:01:35,404 --> 01:01:37,488
This is for calling
my hometown "Podunk"!

1155
01:01:37,489 --> 01:01:40,032
<i>This is for not
returning my sexts!</i>

1156
01:01:40,033 --> 01:01:43,266
And this is for
ruining the prom!

1157
01:01:43,829 --> 01:01:45,139
Yeah!

1158
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:48,416
Holy fucking shit.

1159
01:01:48,417 --> 01:01:50,736
You just brutally
murdered a young girl.

1160
01:01:50,919 --> 01:01:52,044
Yeah.

1161
01:01:52,045 --> 01:01:54,797
And the weird thing is I thought
it would take more hits.

1162
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:56,701
But I guess you live and learn.

1163
01:01:56,967 --> 01:02:00,344
Or at least, she doesn't.
Am I right? Am I right?

1164
01:02:00,345 --> 01:02:01,512
Yeah, whatever you say.

1165
01:02:01,513 --> 01:02:02,705
Of course.

1166
01:02:03,182 --> 01:02:06,601
All right, look, we can still
get out of this thing.

1167
01:02:06,602 --> 01:02:08,853
We just gotta get this
bromance thing back in gear.

1168
01:02:08,854 --> 01:02:11,089
Oh, be careful! Oh, Jesus.

1169
01:02:12,649 --> 01:02:16,261
If you were Doug,
where would you be?

1170
01:02:16,361 --> 01:02:18,881
Maybe these guys can
help us find him.

1171
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,972
Hey, little buddies.

1172
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:25,828
How are my favourite
imitation puppets doing?

1173
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:28,164
Oh, fuck! My hammie, again!
Kick his ass!

1174
01:02:28,165 --> 01:02:29,725
Let's fuck him up!

1175
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:32,780
Wait, wait! I thought you puppets
were the good guys! What the fuck?

1176
01:02:33,003 --> 01:02:34,629
We used to be.

1177
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:37,410
Yeah, but now we've
stared death in the face.

1178
01:02:37,841 --> 01:02:41,886
We've seen the depths of human suffering.
And we're already dead inside.

1179
01:02:41,887 --> 01:02:43,054
Yeah.

1180
01:02:43,055 --> 01:02:44,198
That's awful.

1181
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,348
My God, I'm sorry.

1182
01:02:45,349 --> 01:02:48,392
Come on, you bitch! Yeah,
you scared coward!

1183
01:02:48,393 --> 01:02:50,561
You're not man enough
to fuck with me!

1184
01:02:50,562 --> 01:02:52,998
You wouldn't last two minutes
in my world, you bitch!

1185
01:02:53,023 --> 01:02:54,926
Is that the Mike Tyson rant?

1186
01:02:54,942 --> 01:02:56,844
Fuck you. Fuck you, you ho.

1187
01:02:56,860 --> 01:03:00,307
I'll fuck your ass in front of everybody!
Yeah, that's definitely the Tyson.

1188
01:03:00,697 --> 01:03:02,553
Enough talk! Kill them!

1189

01:03:31,103 --> 01:03:33,062
That was actually a
pretty good one, Zach.

1193
01:03:33,063 --> 01:03:34,207
Yeah? Yeah.

1194
01:03:34,231 --> 01:03:36,232
At least that was
just my reader copy.

1195
01:03:36,233 --> 01:03:38,067
Guys, a little help?

1196
01:03:38,068 --> 01:03:40,719
You four-eyed fuck.
You see this coming?

01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:46,387
Fuck me! Right in the smarts!

1199
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:48,619
That's painful!

1200
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:50,055
But also hilarious.

Oh, my God! Oh, my
God, you're hurt!

1204
01:04:09,308 --> 01:04:11,559
You should see the other guy.

1205
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,727
You killed Tonto?

1206
01:04:12,728 --> 01:04:13,853
Yeah.

1207
01:04:13,854 --> 01:04:16,981
Come on, we need to get you
in the shade. Can you walk?

1208
01:04:16,982 --> 01:04:20,179
It's okay, I got you.
I got you, I got you.

Move! Move!

It's okay.

1211
01:04:24,573 --> 01:04:26,949
You all right? You're
gonna be okay.

1212

It's okay, I got you. I got you.

1213

I got you. There you go.

1214
01:04:32,956 --> 01:04:36,070
You're gonna be okay. It's all
right, it's not that bad.

What?

1221
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:48,804
Sorry.

1222
01:04:48,805 --> 01:04:51,307
That slipped out. Sorry. Yeah,
that came out real fast.

1223

It's okay.

Speaking of,

1226
01:04:56,188 --> 01:04:57,415
since...

1227
01:04:57,689 --> 01:05:02,760
Since this is it for me,
do you want to see them?

1228
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:05,345
See what?

1229
01:05:06,657 --> 01:05:08,762
My boobs, dummy.

I...

1231
01:05:12,371 --> 01:05:14,807
I would. Very much.

1232
01:05:15,249 --> 01:05:16,440
Okay.

1233
01:05:19,545 --> 01:05:21,484
I know you've been
waiting for this.

1234
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:32,996
Pretty nice, huh?

1235
01:05:33,392 --> 01:05:34,998
Unbelievable.

1236
01:05:36,395 --> 01:05:37,622
Wow.

1237
01:05:38,063 --> 01:05:39,753
No tan lines.

1238
01:05:39,857 --> 01:05:42,044
Unbelievable.

1239
01:05:42,651 --> 01:05:46,132
But if he'd move a little
bit, I could see them better.

my eyes as I fade away?

Absolutely, Katnip.

Yeah? I'm sorry. I love them.

I love all of you.

supposed to mean?

guys are wrong.

1450
01:17:12,341 --> 01:17:14,425
Over the course of
one day, I loved,

1451
01:17:14,426 --> 01:17:18,071
I lost, and I almost
died, like, 10 times.

1452
01:17:18,096 --> 01:17:19,805
You also ate a boatload of shit.

1453
01:17:19,806 --> 01:17:21,265
Thank you for the reminder.

1454
01:17:21,266 --> 01:17:23,559
But thankfully, it wasn't real.

1455
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:25,102
You gotta let it go, man.

1456
01:17:25,103 --> 01:17:27,772
You know what? You can
believe what you want,

1457
01:17:27,773 --> 01:17:31,087
but I know my connection
with that girl was real.

1458
01:17:32,069 --> 01:17:34,340
There's a lot of
wiener in this book.

1459
01:17:34,988 --> 01:17:37,343
But I'm not mad about it.

1460
01:17:37,908 --> 01:17:42,184
This probably would make
a really good TV movie.

1461
01:17:44,122 --> 01:17:46,393
Get Alyssa Milano.

1462
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:50,086
Oh.

1463
01:17:50,087 --> 01:17:51,730
Sorry.

1464
01:17:51,755 --> 01:17:53,339
So sorry about that.
It's been a bit of a...

1465
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:54,863
Don't worry about it.

1466
01:17:57,803 --> 01:17:59,374
Wedding's that way.

1467
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:01,287
(LAUGHS)

1468
01:18:01,515 --> 01:18:04,747
Well, it was nice
bumping into you.

1469
01:18:10,148 --> 01:18:11,423
Hey, bud.

1470
01:18:12,109 --> 01:18:13,401
We gotta go.

1471
01:18:13,402 --> 01:18:15,092
I know. Do you...

1472
01:18:15,571 --> 01:18:17,640
What are you stammering about?

1473
01:18:17,823 --> 01:18:21,684
MAN: We are gathered here
today to celebrate the pure

1474
01:18:22,244 --> 01:18:24,230
and magical love of

1475
01:18:24,246 --> 01:18:28,189
these two deeply,
deeply passionate men.

1476
01:18:28,625 --> 01:18:32,003
Guys, that's her. I swear
to God, she's right there.

1477
01:18:32,004 --> 01:18:33,629
Stop, man. There is no her.

1478
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:35,590
Yeah... Do I need to set
you up with a shrink?

1479
01:18:35,591 --> 01:18:36,716
I'm telling you, she's...

1480
01:18:36,717 --> 01:18:37,842
Dude.

1481
01:18:37,843 --> 01:18:39,284
Enough. Fine.

1482
01:18:39,553 --> 01:18:41,076
Letting it go.

1483
01:18:41,263 --> 01:18:43,083
Thank you. MAN:
Some people say

1484
01:18:44,016 --> 01:18:46,085
love is nothing but
a battlefield.

1485
01:18:46,602 --> 01:18:47,912
Not me.

1486
01:18:48,145 --> 01:18:51,915
These days, people don't view
marriage as something to enjoy.

1487
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:55,294
They view it as
something to survive.

1488
01:18:55,319 --> 01:18:57,963
So Doug, Tracey,

1489
01:18:57,988 --> 01:18:59,965
with that, I say

1490
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:04,646
may the odds be ever
in your favour.

1491
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:08,816
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

1492
01:25:02,352 --> 01:25:04,457
This tree has a vagina.

1493
01:25:08,192 --> 01:25:09,679
(LAUGHING)

1494
01:25:09,689 --> 01:25:14,689
