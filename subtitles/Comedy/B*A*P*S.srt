Nothing.

39
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,268
There you go,
Nate.

40
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:42,836
Just the way
you like it.

41
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:48,209
Radio: hey, Georgia,

43
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:52,813

00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:06,194
You heard that right.
Auditions are

48
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:07,761
so get
a pen and paper...

49
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,763
Nisi?

50
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:10,764
You're daydreaming again.

51
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:12,466
No, no, no, I was
taking their order.

52
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,135
Uh-uh. it's my second time
i done told you.

53
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,004
I'm taking $10 out
of your doggone pay.

54
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:19,507
Ohh, Mr. Johnson!

55
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:22,042
Ohh!

56
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,143
$10?

57
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,612
I don't want to hear
nothing, nisi.

58
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,146
Not another word,
another phrase,
another syllable.

59
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,448
Hey! shut up!

60
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:29,350
I'm the captain
of this doggone ship.

61
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,286
If it's too hot
in the kitchen,
nisi, leave.

62
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,887
If the shoe fit,
wear it.

63
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,223
If it too tight,
take it off!

64
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:45,266
* out with the old *

65
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:46,767
* in with the new... *

66
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:47,635
I can't believe

67
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,903
Ali and James
stood us up again.

68
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,038
I'm through
with them, girl.

69
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,139
Now, you see
what I mean?

70
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,407
I ain't got
nothing to lose.

71
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,476
What you mean you ain't
got nothing to lose?

72
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:57,645
You talking about using
all the money we have

73
00:02:57,645 --> 00:03:00,348
to go to some audition
in California.

74
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:01,715
Nisi, you ain't
even a dancer.

75
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,452
I am a dancer, and I'll
be dancin' my butt off

76
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:06,086
for some $10,000.

77
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07,488
Now, if I get
this job, Mick,

78
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:09,089
we're going to have
more than enough money

79
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,224
for the salon
and the restaurant.

80
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:11,625
You ain't using
our life savings

81
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,227
to go to California
on some maybe mission.

82
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:14,928
Your life is right here.

83
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,264
We don't deserve this.

84
00:03:16,264 --> 00:03:17,598
We deserve the best.

85
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:19,433
Man: that's
why you got me.

86
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:22,503
And you...
You got me.

87
00:03:24,272 --> 00:03:26,507
Aw, come on, baby,
I'm sorry I'm late,

88
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,476
but, you know,
sometimes businessmen
stuff can't wait.

89
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:30,511
Well, you can just
keep your "sorry,"

90
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:33,046
'cause you're
a sorry excuse
for a boyfriend.

91
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,082
Hold on, hold on,
hold on now.

92
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,484
You ain't know
why we late, girl.

93
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:38,619
I do know that y'all
couldn't show up
here on time

94
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:39,920
to walk us home
from work.

95
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,524
We've been checking out
this classic 1935 Ford

96
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,426
Eric's grandfather's
selling.

97
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:47,027
That's right,
and he's gonna
sell it to us

98
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,429
half the price.

99
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:50,964
If he was giving it away,
it still wouldn't matter.

100
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,833
Y'all ain't got no jobs.

101
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,303
We've been thinking about
putting applications in
for the last month, baby,

102
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:57,338
but, you know, the buses
don't run everywhere.

103
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:58,606
But, look here,
we're gonna
buy the car,

104
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:01,575
and we're
gonna start our
own page-a-cab

105
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,444
luxury
cab company.

106
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:06,614
Oh, no.
Come on, Mick.

107
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:07,581
Bye.

108
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,182
Hey, come on, come on.

109
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,885
Nisi, why you
act like that?

110
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:14,221
Ali, I guess I'm tired

111
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:17,257
of hearing about
all your pipe dreams.

112
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,159
If you really
cared about me,

113
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,161
you'd get rid
of that tired perm

114
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:23,063
I've been telling
you about forever.

115
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,164
Oh, I don't
cut my hair!

116
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,466
I ain't cutting
the hair, no.

117
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:27,468
If anything, I'm gonna
bring the perm back.

118
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:31,004
Woman: I was so mad,
i just walked out.

119
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,940
Second woman:
And he said
that was his cousin?

120
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,342
That's what he said.

121
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:37,077
Man: ha ha ha!

122
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:41,181
Nisi: ...Bopping
around here with that
cracked-up perm he got.

123
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:42,383
Mickey:
you know he's wrong.

124
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:44,885
Girl, why won't he
let you cut his hair?

125
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:49,222
I don't know. I've
been trying forever.

126
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,624
Now, I'm
a hairdresser, right?

127
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,426
And my man walking
around here

128
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:55,228
looking like
a broke-down superfly.

129
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:59,099
No. no, superfly's
little brother.

130
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,133
Right, right.
Superflea.

131
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,336
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

132
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:04,872
Ow! please
stay on the head.

133
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:07,975
Shoot, you said you
wanted these pompoms,
so you got 'em.

134
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,311
Girl, we need
to move on,

135
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,746
and we need to get
us some new jobs.

136
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,383
TV: hey, what's up, kids?
Idalis kickin' it mtv style.

137
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:17,184
Listen, y'all,
i got the inside scoop

138
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:19,620
on the biggest
video audition
to hit the airwaves

139
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,156
since the artist formerly
known as prince was looking
for that special girl

140
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,092
for his video,
the most beautiful girl
in the world.

141
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:26,394
Remember that?

142
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:29,062
Well, heavy d is doing
a unique video himself.

143
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,098
He's going to be shooting
this video all over the world

144
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:35,068
in beautiful, exotic places
like Brazil and Italy.

145
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,471
He's looking for that
oh, so special girl...

146
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,473
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Go back.

147
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:40,674
Idalis: ...A great body,
a great smile,

148
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,610
and that twinkle
in her eye.

149
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,745
He's looking for...

150
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:45,813
Nisi: look!
Mickey: Huh?

151
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:47,981
So, that's
the same audition!

152
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:48,782
Girl?

153
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,083
I think it's
a sign from god.

154
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:54,187
My mama always told me
good things come in 3.

155
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,222
I heard it on the radio,

156
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,057

well, there's
just one little thing
i have to tell you.

576
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,420
I'm not making
a music video.

577

i was going to find...

This job involves...

581
00:26:09,636 --> 00:26:12,605
An old man who is
dying from cancer.

582

Know what's
even sadder?

584

He was never able
to marry the one woman
that he truly loved.

Why come?

586
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:30,356
Because he's white...

587
00:26:30,356 --> 00:26:32,825
And she was black.

588
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:35,394
She was the housekeeper
at the family's estate.

589
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:36,663
Her name was Lily.

I'm going to play?

00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,166
Well, not quite.

592
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,168
Um...

593
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:47,406
When his family discovered
their relationship,

594
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:49,075
they separated them.

595
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:51,277
They immediately
married him off

596
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:54,546
to a white woman.

597
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:57,183
And he never saw Lily again.

598
00:26:57,183 --> 00:27:00,319
Anyway, he's dying,

599
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:04,190
and the only family that
he has left is his nephew.

00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,424
That's me.

601
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:07,293
Sorry. I'm his nephew.

602
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,828
Uh, and when I learned

603
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:11,964
that he has less
than 2 weeks to live,

604
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,867
well, I decided
that maybe I should

605
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:17,837
try and find the love
of his life. Find Lily.

606
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:20,439
That is so
sweet of you.

607
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:22,742
Well, it was also
impossible.

608
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:28,214
But, seems I have
managed to find...

609
00:27:28,214 --> 00:27:30,750

610
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,385
Oh, that's who
I'm going to play.

611
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,554
Yes. yes, exactly.

612
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:37,757
Well, my idea was...

613
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:40,326
You know how much
your grandmother loved him,

614
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:43,963
so, you show up here
out of the goodness
of your heart.

615
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:46,498
You just do anything
and everything
that you can

616
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,968
to make sure
that his final days

617
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:52,939
are filled with--
with kindness and love.

That's beautiful.

Aw, I'm glad
you think so.

So, if you'd
be so kind
as to follow me.

623
00:28:05,752 --> 00:28:07,954
Right this way.

a surprise for you.

to meet Denise.

granddaughter.

they were coming?

I received this package
from his attorney
this morning.

1326

Mr. blakemore,

1327
01:00:04,134 --> 01:00:07,604
Isaac has filed documents
of incompetency against you.

1328
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:10,007
I guess once he got
the photos he needed,

1329
01:00:10,007 --> 01:00:12,743
the girls were no longer
of any value to him.

1330
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:17,948
He claims you befriended
2 girls from the ghetto

1331
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:20,951
after you caught them
trying to break
into your home.

1332
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:23,921
You then moved the girls
into your home

1333
01:00:23,921 --> 01:00:26,991
and, for a lack
of a better phrase,

1334
01:00:26,991 --> 01:00:30,560
you've been allowing them
to Rob you blind.

01:05:31,895 --> 01:05:34,531
[Laughter]

1449
01:05:35,732 --> 01:05:37,934
Mickey: we had
no idea you could dance
like that, Mr. b.

1450
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:40,804
I haven't had this
much fun since I used
to dance with Lily.

1451
01:05:40,804 --> 01:05:43,540
You girls
are truly amazing.

1452
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,475
Ah, Lily.

1453
01:05:45,475 --> 01:05:46,943
Lily, what a lady.

1454
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,578
Nisi: what a lady.

1455
01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:51,781
Oh, I'm sorry you
didn't meet the man
of your dreams tonight,

1456
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,550
but maybe next time.

1457
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:58,922
That's ok.
I've known him since
high school anyway.

1458
01:05:58,922 --> 01:06:00,657
Oh?

1459
01:06:00,657 --> 01:06:03,360
His name is Ali.

1460
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,695
He's back
in Georgia.

1461
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,766
I really
love him, too.

1462
01:06:09,766 --> 01:06:12,236
What's the problem, then?

1463
01:06:12,236 --> 01:06:15,239
Ali don't
have no dreams,

1464
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:17,841
no drive,
no ambition.

1465
01:06:17,841 --> 01:06:20,277
Nothing.

1466
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,181
Just like me.

1467
01:06:27,617 --> 01:06:30,020
No, it's true.

1468
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:32,022
I almost lost
all of my dreams

1469
01:06:32,022 --> 01:06:35,392
when I was
a very young man.

1470
01:06:35,392 --> 01:06:38,395
Fortunately,
there was a--ha ha--

1471
01:06:38,395 --> 01:06:42,999
a skinny, bowlegged girl
who was filled with dreams.

1472
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:46,736
Everything I have today
is because of her.

1473
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:48,538
I mean,
i had no ambition.

1474
01:06:48,538 --> 01:06:51,208
But she had enough
for the both of us.

1475
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:53,543
What do you
mean by that?

1476
01:06:53,543 --> 01:06:58,148
Well, she always
dreamt about becoming
a clothing designer,

1477
01:06:58,148 --> 01:07:01,085
and I loved her
so much that--

1478
01:07:01,085 --> 01:07:07,023
oh, so that's how
you got interested
in the fabric business.

1479
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,226
Yeah.

1480
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:14,764
Well, who was she?

1481
01:07:16,633 --> 01:07:18,435
Your grandmother.

1482
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:26,643
Oh.

1483
01:07:28,745 --> 01:07:31,047
See,
that's what I'm...

1484
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,649
Taking about.

1485
01:07:32,649 --> 01:07:35,385
Ali is different.

1486
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:36,920
Nisi...

1487
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:42,192
There is no fortune
worth the loss
of a true love.

1488
01:07:44,461 --> 01:07:47,131
Some things
are priceless.

1489
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:54,571
[Snoring]

1490
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:23,500
Where have you been?

1491
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,502
You know, you've
been acting strange

1492
01:08:25,502 --> 01:08:27,504
ever since
we got home.

1493
01:08:27,504 --> 01:08:29,706
What's up with you,
nisi?

1494
01:08:29,706 --> 01:08:30,874
Nisi?!

1495
01:08:30,874 --> 01:08:33,377
What? I've been
thinking, ok,

1496
01:08:33,377 --> 01:08:35,745
about how we going
to get up out of here.

1497
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:36,713
What?

1498
01:08:36,713 --> 01:08:39,115
Don't act like
you don't know, Mickey.

1499
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,517
The guilt,

1500
01:08:40,517 --> 01:08:43,153
the guilt
of what we doing.

1501
01:08:43,153 --> 01:08:45,955
Now, that old man down
there is a nice old man.

1502
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:49,759
And he ain't got nothing
around him but people
trying to use him,

1503
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:51,261
like you and me.

1504
01:08:51,261 --> 01:08:54,130
I know.
Why do you think
i got up and left.

1505
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,866
We should've been
done got up and left.

1506
01:09:10,947 --> 01:09:15,885
D, don't you think
that we could at least
say good-bye?

1507
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,523
We can't.

1508
01:09:19,523 --> 01:09:20,890
Why?

1509
01:09:24,561 --> 01:09:28,765
'Cause if I go to him
and I say we leaving,

1510
01:09:28,765 --> 01:09:31,235
he going to say, "why?"

1511
01:09:32,302 --> 01:09:34,971
And I'm going to
have to tell him

1512
01:09:34,971 --> 01:09:40,377
that you and me
been a part of this
whole big lie.

1513
01:09:41,778 --> 01:09:43,613
I can't do it.

1514
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,983
So we're going to
write him a letter,

1515
01:09:46,983 --> 01:09:49,786
and we're going to
tell him the truth...
Everything.

1516
01:09:49,786 --> 01:09:51,020
Everything?

1517
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,922
Everything!

1518
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:32,596
What time is it?

1519
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:36,700
12:15.

1520
01:10:38,368 --> 01:10:40,504
Why are you still up?

1521
01:10:40,504 --> 01:10:43,873
I guess I can't sleep.

1522
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:48,645
You go on,
go back to bed.

1523
01:10:48,645 --> 01:10:51,615
Flight don't leave
for another 7 hours.

1524
01:10:51,615 --> 01:10:53,650
I'm going to
be downstairs.

1525
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,587
Hey, d,

1526
01:10:57,587 --> 01:11:01,024
what we going to do
when we get off that plane?

1527
01:11:01,024 --> 01:11:05,362
We ain't got no money,
no apartment, nothing.

1528
01:11:06,496 --> 01:11:09,265
We worse than
when we started out.

1529
01:11:15,405 --> 01:11:18,908
Maybe,
but maybe not.

1530
01:11:19,809 --> 01:11:24,013
Some things
is priceless,
you know, Mick?

1531
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,532
[Door opens]

1532
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:46,536
[Door closes]

1533
01:12:33,483 --> 01:12:35,952
[Door opens]

01:12:35,952 --> 01:12:37,821
[Door closes]

1535
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:42,492
* I'll be loving you *

1536
01:12:42,492 --> 01:12:45,529
* forever *

1537
01:12:45,529 --> 01:12:51,234
* deep inside my heart
you'll leave me never *

1538
01:12:51,234 --> 01:12:53,036
excuse me, miss.

1539
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:57,641
It was never my intention
to involve myself in
your private affairs

1540
01:12:57,641 --> 01:13:00,944
or to come off
like a player-hater,

1541
01:13:00,944 --> 01:13:03,547
but I have become
a kind of a middleman,

1542
01:13:03,547 --> 01:13:05,549
and I think
it's high time

1543
01:13:05,549 --> 01:13:09,586
that you two
talked with each other,
face to face.

1544
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:13,690
* you are my life *

1545
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:17,461
* and you're the last
thing on my mind *

1546
01:13:17,461 --> 01:13:21,397
* before i
go to sleep at night *

1547
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,534
* you're always around *

1548
01:13:24,534 --> 01:13:26,636
* when I'm in... *

1549
01:13:26,636 --> 01:13:28,404
I took your advice

1550
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,406
and decided
to help myself.

1551
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,575
* ...On my mind *

1552
01:13:31,575 --> 01:13:34,377
* you were my soul
and you... *

1553
01:13:34,377 --> 01:13:37,213
how'd you
get here, Ali?

1554
01:13:37,213 --> 01:13:39,549
Your boy Alfred
hooked me up.

1555
01:13:39,549 --> 01:13:41,084
He called me
late last night

1556
01:13:41,084 --> 01:13:42,686
and insisted
that we come out
right away.

1557
01:13:42,686 --> 01:13:45,889
We? James here, too?

1558
01:13:45,889 --> 01:13:47,991
Yeah.

1559
01:13:47,991 --> 01:13:50,960
Nisi, I don't know if
you want to stay here,

1560
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:54,564
if you want to go home,
or what you want to do.

1561
01:13:54,564 --> 01:13:56,966
All I know is
I've had one dream

1562
01:13:56,966 --> 01:13:59,769
and one dream only
since high school...

1563
01:14:01,571 --> 01:14:05,742
And that's--and
that's to be with you.

1564
01:14:05,742 --> 01:14:09,345
* even if you
took my heart *

1565
01:14:09,345 --> 01:14:11,648
* and tore it apart *

1566
01:14:11,648 --> 01:14:14,283
come on, they're
playing our song.

1567
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:16,586
* I would love you still *

1568
01:14:16,586 --> 01:14:19,489
* forever *

1569
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:29,933
* we've had our fun *

1570
01:14:29,933 --> 01:14:33,202
* and we've made mistakes *

1571
01:14:34,604 --> 01:14:38,608
* but who'd have
guessed along that road *

1572
01:14:38,608 --> 01:14:41,110
* we'd learn
to give and take? *

1573
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:46,182
* give so much more
than I could ever... *

1574
01:14:46,182 --> 01:14:47,150
James:
you know what?

1575
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:49,653
Everything you said
about me was true.

1576
01:14:52,789 --> 01:14:54,991
I do need to change.

1577
01:14:57,226 --> 01:14:58,628
So from now on,

1578
01:14:58,628 --> 01:15:00,363
I promise you,
I'm going to change.

1579
01:15:00,363 --> 01:15:03,366
For real?

1580
01:15:03,366 --> 01:15:05,935
For real.

1581
01:15:05,935 --> 01:15:07,737
[Sighs]

1582
01:15:07,737 --> 01:15:12,108
This--this is
the kind of stuff
you deserve.

1583
01:15:16,646 --> 01:15:18,815
[Sobbing]

1584
01:15:19,749 --> 01:15:22,952
But I just--
i just can't
give it to you.

1585
01:15:25,054 --> 01:15:27,791
I mean, you--you
deserve nice stuff.

1586
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:31,394
You deserve a big
old house,

1587
01:15:31,394 --> 01:15:33,196
and--and--you--you--

1588
01:15:33,196 --> 01:15:37,801
you--you--deserve
your--your own
backyard.

1589
01:15:37,801 --> 01:15:42,538
And--every--
everybody else got
a little white dog.

1590
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:45,141
Why--why you
can't have one?

1591
01:15:45,141 --> 01:15:47,777
[Sobbing]

1592
01:15:47,777 --> 01:15:49,946
I want to take you
out to dinner,

1593
01:15:49,946 --> 01:15:52,548
and--and every time
we go out,
we got to watch...

1594
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:54,283
Other people eat.

1595
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:56,753
Hell, I want to
eat, too.

1596
01:16:00,189 --> 01:16:03,126
And you need--you
need some clothes.

1597
01:16:03,126 --> 01:16:05,294
Why--why should you
have to wear your
Sunday clothes

1598
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:07,631
on--on Wednesday?

1599
01:16:09,699 --> 01:16:11,835
Now, look, girl,

1600
01:16:11,835 --> 01:16:13,837
don't think--
don't think
the brother a punk

1601
01:16:13,837 --> 01:16:16,706
because he crying
like a little girl,
but...

1602
01:16:16,706 --> 01:16:18,908
You're my queen.

1603
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:20,576
And...

1604
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:23,312
