1
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,438
Raphael, stop running, you'll fall.
We're a long way from the car!

2
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,234
Pretty, isn't it?

3
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,317
It all seems so complicated.

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,511
You'll see.
This will change our lives.

5
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,596
If you say so.

6
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,232
We'll be happy in Cassis.

7
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,269
- We're not in Salon-de-Provence?
- Sure.

8
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,995
But we'll have the seashore!

9
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,154
- Don't, it's dangerous.
- I have an earplug.

10
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,634
Here I am. Hello?

11
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,748
Jean! Funny you should call.
We're just leaviing Cassis.

12
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,109
Not good news

13
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,793
about the transfer...

14
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,399
I'll call you back.

15
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,154
What's going on?

16
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,756
- No need to quit your job.
- What?

17
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,031
My transfer was denied.

18
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,518
No need to get upset.

19
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,154
I'm not upset. Do I seem upset?

20
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,269
Then stop saying that. Shit!

21
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,590
Everything OK?.

22
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,918
I understand.
Just see what you can do.

23
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,394
Thanks again, Jean.

24
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,951
Why do you thank him?
The strings he pulled didn't help.

25
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,432
Not his fault. The handicapped
come before string-pullers.

26
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,796
The Riviiera is handicapped only?.

27
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,234
Of course not.

28
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,672
I was so happy to move.

29
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,074
You were tired of the idea.

30
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,390
Because I knew we were moviing.

31
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,068
Now that I know we're not,
I feel we missed out.

32
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,709
- This summer...
- No! The hell with vacation!

33
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,714
You said we'd move to the shore.
You worked so hard I never saw you.

34
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,996
I want to live there,
Philippe Abrams!

35
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,468
Yes, darling.

36
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,273
- Are you upset?
- Yes, so?

37
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,198
Don't be. It won't help.

38
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,910
Why are you always against me?

39
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,952
You're crazy to come here!

40
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,833
Anybody follow you?

41
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,312
Were you seen entering?

42
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,269
You didn't talk to anyone?

43
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,357
Come on,
we work for the post office.

44
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,709
Quiet, my neck is on the line!

45
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,911
No it's not. I didn't get the job.

46
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,714
I'm an executive,
1 1 years busting my ass in Salon!

47
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,236
If you shout, I'm done for.

48
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,835
I earned that transfer,
handicapped or not.

49
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,589
I'll reimburse you.

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,991
Find me a spot.
Julie's giviing me hell.

51
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,638
In Sanary-On-The-Sea,
the director's retiring in a few weeks.

52
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,958
Perfect. I must have it.

53
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,350
Keep your damn voice down.

54
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,593
- There.
- There what?

55
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,396
Yes?

56
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,796
No, I'm not busy.

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,035
The boss wants you.

58
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,435
Oh. Why?.

59
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,870
I don't know. You're busy?

60
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,435
Be right there.

61
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,478
Don't leave with me.

62
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,598
Say I'm handicapped on the request.

63
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,876
Are you insane?

64
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,714
Why not? A mistake on a form.
What's the risk?.

65
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,837
Big! Big risk!

66
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,954
If they find out, you're in trouble.
But I'm dead.

67
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,036
One moment.

68
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,511
Thank you for coming, Doctor.

69
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,517
- Doctor?.
- No, I'm not taking sick leave.

70
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,113
It's very minor.

71
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,799
Goodbye, Doctor.

72
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,635
Julie!

73
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,035
To Sanary!

74
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,879
Thanks. You still have me for 2 days.

75
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,429
Excuse me, sir.
An inspector wants to see you.

76
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,910
What inspector?.

77
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,878
It's about your transfer.

78
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,269
- Where is he?
- In the lobby.

79
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,277
Stall him for five minutes!

80
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,876
Shit.

81
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,632
I should have tried it out!

82
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,399
I'm Philippe Abrams.

83
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,599
Name's Lebic. Just a few questions
about your transfer request.

84
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,955
Of course.

85
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,753
Those brats.

86
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,868
School kids slashed my tires.
I won't miss them.

87
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,430
- Need help?
- I must do it myself.

88
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,479
Sit down. I already am.

89
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,869
What can I do for you?

90
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,192
How long have you been
handicapped, Mr. Abrams?

91
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,835
It's hard for me to remember.

92
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,870
I was little. It's all a blur.

93
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,115
Reliviing it is traumatic.

94
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,196
Sorry.

95
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,271
Muscle spasms.

96
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,833
It's over. I'm fine.

97
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,918
Mr. Abrams. I have
two transfer requests in your name.

98
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,277
One, recently,
for a limited-mobility person,

99
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,549
for the Sanary spot.

100
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,797
The other, for Cassis,
6 months ago. No handicap.

101
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,600
Did you make both requests?

102
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,710
I made both requests.

103
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,439
Yes.

104
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,594
The first,

105
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,472
as non-handicapped,

106
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,274
because I wanted to be
treated as normal.

107
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,954
Like anyone else.

108
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,515
It's important to us,

109
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,153
the handicapped,

110
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,517
to be seen by people like you
as deserviing more than pity.

111
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,358
That's very laudable.

112
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,038
Of course,
if my transfer depends on it...

113
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,315
No, not at all.

114
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,353
This is just
an obligatory verification.

115
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,919
You know, I often
get false declarations

116
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,873
in requests for sought-after posts,
like the Riviiera.

117
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,718
- No!
- It's rampant.

118
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,989
How shameful!

119
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,958
You can say that again.

120
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,991
You'll love Sanary.

121
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,432
I won't bother you anymore.

122
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,318
Not at all.
Goodbye, Mr. Lebic.

123
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,313
How shameful.

124
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,355
Nut job.

125
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,233
You're a total nut job.

126
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,679
You're my friend.
You'll fix this.

127
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,399
I'll fix nothing.

128
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,519
Don't you dare say we're friends.
Not here.

129
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,434
Not a handicap imposter.

130
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,716
I only did it for Julie.
I'm terribly sorry.

131
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,996
All right.

132
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,549
Good news and bad news.

133
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,949
I've been suspended?

134
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,631
Worse.

135
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,956
Fired?

136
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:07,951
Worse.

137
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,549
- Worse than fired?
- Transferred up north.

138
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,279
North? Not Lyons!

139
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,989
No, not Lyons. The north north.

140
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,117
Not Paris. Don't tell me.

141
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,835
Not Paris.

142
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,230
Farther north.

143
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,276
Belgium?

144
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,751
No. Before Belgium, there's...

145
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,598
The North region. Near Lille.

146
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,114
Little what?

147
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,191
No! The city of Lille.

148
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,555
Lille? That's horrible.

149
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,473
Starts next Monday.

150
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,915
This coming Monday?.

151
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,908
I can't. I have no warm clothes.
No place to live.

152
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,352
There's an apartment
for the local manager.

153
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,559
What's the place?

154
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,910
Bergues.

155
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,955
I'll refuse it.

156
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,553
Can't. It's disciplinary.

157
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,635
What's the good news?

158
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,317
That was it.

159
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,874
What's the bad news?

160
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,035
You stay there 2 years.

161
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,391
- Two years?
- Minimum.

162
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,153
Two years in the north. No!

163
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,314
It's the north or you're fired. Sorry.

164
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,028
How can I tell Julie?
She thinks it's Sanary.

165
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,670
You leave when the coast is clear.

166
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,429
Now!

167
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,788
Hi, honey.

168
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,999
I'm looking at apartments
in Sanary. Great.

169
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,475
We must hurry.

170
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,789
Don't worry, it's off.

171
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,189
It fell through.

172
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,839
Another handicapped guy?.

173
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,635
Sort of.

174
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,558
- I can't believe it.
- Hang on.

175
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,677
They offered better.

176
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,437
You scared me. Where?

177
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,479
- Bergues.
- Where?

178
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,429
Beautiful Bergues.

179
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,277
In the north.
Isn't that wonderful?

180
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,229
What did you do?

181
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,435
Me? Nothing.

182
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,829
I'm not an idiot.

183
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,351
If you do well, you stay south.
You must've screwed up big-time.

184
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,632
No, it's just the opposite.

185
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,308
They offered me 2 years up north.
I earn points,

186
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,875
get priority
for all the Riviiera jobs.

187
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,117
In terms of index,
after 2 years in the north,

188
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,753
it's like I'm handicapped!

189
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,036
Turn it down. I won't freeze.

190
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,318
Who's going to freeze?
We're not liviing outdoors up there.

191
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,236
Dad,

192
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,515
I'll lose my toes.

193
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,795
Why would you?

194
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,109
Not the North Pole.

195
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,671
Not the North Pole. The north!

196
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,717
The truth. What did you do?

197
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,394
I got a great promotion.
I don't get this.

198
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,389
I'll call Jean.

199
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,388
To get the Sanary job,
I said I was handicapped.

200
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,232
You pretended you were handicapped?

201
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,356
I'm sorry.

202
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,397
Go to the North Pole alone!

203
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,476
What is it?

204
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,228
Recognize me?
I married Julie, your niece.

205
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,354
Right, she said you'd come bug me.
What do you want?

206
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,160
I have to go to the North region.

207
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,315
A transfer.

208
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,590
Julie said you know
the area near Lille.

209
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,032
In 1934, my mother
slept with a Sheutemi.

210
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,510
What?

211
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,756
I said, in 1934,

212
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,680
my mother slept with a Sheutemi.

213
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,790
A shut-in?

214
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,712
Not a shut-in!

215
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,194
A Sheutemi.

216
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,030
That's what they call people up there.
Men, women, children! Sheutemi!

217
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,549
Shutemies?

218
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,076
Even animals are Sheutemi! Dogs...

219
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,278
Cats are sheutemi.

220
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,638
Cows, chickens, calves
are all sheutemi.

221
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,359
And the language is sheutemi, too.

222
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,916
They say O instead of A,

223
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,153
SHKA instead of SH,
and they say SH...

224
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,749
but instead of S.
They're crackpots!

225
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,039
Just when you think you got it,

226
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,915
they tell you a "mop"
is a wassingue!

227
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,550
And what's life like there?

228
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,835
Pretty easy?.

229
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,548
Rough! Very rough!

230
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,680
Only the ones in coal
live well.

231
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,352
The others are just...

232
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,512
miserable.

233
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,314
They die very young there.

234
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,114
Good thing my mother
came back south.

235
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,836
I was ten.
I couldn't stand the cold.

236
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,714
It's cold up there?

237
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,148
Summer's all right.
About thirty degrees.

238
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,312
But in winter it goes
down, down, down.

239
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,557
Twenty, zero, minus twenty!
Minus fifty!

240
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,112
You figure you'll stay in bed.
It goes to minus 60!

241
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,395
Minus 60?

242
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,318
The north!

243
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,312
You asked, kid.

244
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,518
It's the north.

245
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,949
Got your answer?.

246
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,394
Good.

247
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,155
See? Freezing fog.

248
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,669
- What's freezing fog?
- A horror.

249
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,109
Look. 40 in the morning,
fifty at midday. Not that cold!

250
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,073
Think those are real?

251
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,076
Aren't they?.

252
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,512
Open your eyes. Regional officials
pressure the weather serviice.

253
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,075
- Or no one would go there.
- Think so?

254
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,033
Freezing fog.

255
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,035
Bergues.

256
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,715
Probably not in there.

257
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,592
Calculating route.

258
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,550
It is.

259
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,794
Shut up, bitch.

260
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,676
I can't go.
I'm not strong enough.

261
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,310
You're better off here,
with the boy.

262
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,588
Don't take that off.

263
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,030
I'll be too hot on the way up.

264
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,595
Better you get used to wearing it.

265
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,355
Raphael,

266
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,955
take care of Mom.

267
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,235
- I'm counting on you.
- OK, Dad.

268
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,272
All this is my fault.

269
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,630
No, Julie. It's destiny.

270
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,950
I'll call you when I get to...

271
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,399
the North region.

272
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,153
Hello, Mr. Bailleul?

273
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,709
Philippe Abrams.

274
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,911
Your new manager.

275
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,151
I'll arrive this evening.

276
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,231
Meet you at City Hall.

277
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,955
Can't hear you. Bad connection.

278
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,154
See you tonight.

279
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,112
With the North Sea

280
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,115
to wave our last goodbye,

281
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,913
and waves of dunes
to hold back the waves

282
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,317
and the backs of rocks
drowned by the tide,

283
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,951
sunken is the heart
when the tide is low...

284
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,595
Shit!

285
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,198
Police. License and registration.

286
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,509
Sorry, I was speeding.
I was preoccupied.

287
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,799
I know I'm in the wrong.

288
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,553
You were doing thirty.

289
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,511
A hundred thirty?.

290
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,591
No, 30. 15 times 2.

291
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,912
30? Is that possible?

292
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,357
It's dangerous to drive slow
on the highway, Mr. Abrams.

293
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,953
I'm writing you up.

294
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,558
I've been transferred to the north
so I'm in no hurry.

295
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,915
The North region?

296
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,436
Go ahead.

297
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,035
Thanks.

298
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,111
But step on it a little.

299
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,799
Be brave.

300
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,550
Jacques!

301
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,473
Oh fuck.

302
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,318
The North region.

303
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,638
WELCOME TO THE NORTH

304
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,916
You've reached your destination.

305
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,635
No, it can't be.

306
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,671
My God! You're not dead?

307
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,278
Welcome, Mr. Abrams.

308
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,151
Mr. Bailleul?

309
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,874
Yesh, it'sh me.

310
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,350
Oh, vandeus!

311
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,516
Don't move. Better call for help.

312
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,915
I'm jusht fine.

313
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,434
I might have killed you!

314
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,079
It'sh all right.

315
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,874
I shaw your lishensh plate.
From out of town.

316
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,277
I waved to you to shtop.
You didn't she me. I'm OK.

317
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,635
Your jaw is hurt.

318
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,471
- Huh?
- It hurts you to talk?.

319
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,670
Whot?

320
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,830
Your jaw OK?.

321
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,197
No. My ash shmartsh.
I fell on my ash.

322
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,750
Your "ash"? This isn't good.
Wouldn't you like to see a doctor?.

323
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,559
No, I shed I'm fine!

324
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,439
Listen, you're really talking funny.

325
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,272
Cosh I talk shti?.

326
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,511
- Talk what?
- I talk shti, that'sh ole.

327
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,632
You mean that's sheteumi?.

328
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,756
Your plashe is upshtairsh.
Over the posht offish.

329
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,548

330
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,033
Great.

In here.

332
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,190

333
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,436
Good night, shir.

336
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,839
Bailleul, wait!

337
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,313
No furniture!

338
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,118
Where's the furniture?

339
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,630
I don't get it.

340
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,349
Isn't it furnished?

341
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,559
The ex-manager took it.

342
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,155
Why?.

343
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,674
For hish new offish?

344
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,955
- What fish?
- The furniture.

345
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,315
I don't get it.

346
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,755
For hish new offish.

347
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,070
New fish?
Why would fish need furniture?

348
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,554
Why give it to fish?

349
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,598
Offish! He didn't give it to fishkas.
He took it with him.

350
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,588
Why give it away?.

351
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,670
I never shed dish.

352
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,433
Why dish? You said fish.

353
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,913
You said for his new fish.

354
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,673
Oh, all right.

355
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,108
I shed, hish new offish.

356
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,315
That's what I said.

357
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,629
Hish offish.

358
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,557
His office! Not his fish.

359
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,869
His offish. Dish ish it.

360
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,111
You all talk like that here?

361
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,591
Yesh. The Shti all shpeak Shti.
Shome shpeak Flemishka.

362
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,549

00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,028
- What will you do?

364
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,153
In Bergues, at this hour?.

Dish ish my housh.

366
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,196
Doesn't even sound like language.

367
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,709
Nothing.

368
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,753
Not very big,
but at least it's furnished.

369
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,875
Nice of you
to inviite me to sleep over.

370
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,230
My pleashure. Hungry?. Thirshty?.

371
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,034
No, I want to sleep.
It was a long trip.

372
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,754
Go right to bed then.
Upshtairsh.

373
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,189
Are you married?

374
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,472
Married? Me? No chance.
Me and women...

375
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,159
You live alone?

376
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,635
- It's my mom's housh.
- Your mom?

377
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,751
That'sh her room. She's shleeping.

378
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,632
Bathroom down the hall.

379
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,193
That'sh the room.

380
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,358
We can't make noishe.

381
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,273

385
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,832
You southerners like lavender.

386
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,431
Clean sheets, lavender schent.

387
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,356
It shmellsh sho good.

388
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,789
Should we make your bed?

389
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,429
I'll manage on my own.

390
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,670
Good night.

391
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,036
Sleep...

392
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,391

395
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,597
That takesh the cake!

396
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,556
Mr. Abramsh, it'sh time.

Tiime to wake up.

398

You frightened me.

399
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,714
You frightened me.

400
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,790
What do you want?

401
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,359
No, what do you want?

402
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,555
What do you mean?

403
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,188
For breakfast.

404
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,512

Yesh. It'sh a housh,

00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,954
No tea, only coffee.

409
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,112

Mom, I couldn't put him

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,918
He'sh my new bosh.

Quit it, Mom.
She'sh kidding.

425

430
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,634
Chicory!

431
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,796
Tashte it, before critishizing.

- Sure, very good.

433
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,718
What's on the bread you dip?

434
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,756
That?

435
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,395
It'sh maroilles.

436
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,755
What's that?

437
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,590
Cheese. A little shtrong.
Like vieux-Lille.

438
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,508
Want to tashte?

439
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,678
Not ash shtrong in the mouth
as in the shmell.

440
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,834
Good, huh?

441
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,268
Just as strong inside.

442
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,877
That's why we dunk it in coffee.
Takes the edge off.

443
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,155
Dunk it.

444
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,879
I'd rather not.

445
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,396
Good, huh?

446
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,633
Young man!

447
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,952
A brown sugar faluche.

448
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,390
You hardly ate.

449
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,709
Thank you.

450
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,313
It's about time!

451
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,112
My shon, my shon.

452
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,351
- See you tonight.
- Not too late!

453
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,995
Promish?

454
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,478
- Your mom's unusual.
- Not to me.

455
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,795
Maroilles in this?

456
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,116
No, the shmell lingersh.

457
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,594
Everything stinks.

458
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,109
Breathe through your mouth,
air it out.

459
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,393
That's maroilles.

460
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,872
Strange. It's not so cold.

461
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,718
For April, it's warm.

462
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,114
That's what I thought.

463
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,197
Must be global warming.

464
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,072
Used to be harsh, right?

465
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,790
In April, we used to shkate,
make shnowmen.

466
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,591
Really?.

467
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,112
The besht part ushed to be
delivering mail by shled.

468
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,074
Are you putting me on?

469
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,794
- Just a little.
- It's not funny.

470
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,195
Why come north
if you fear the cold?

471
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,231
- Hey, Antoine.
- Hey! Zounds!

472
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,472
Mr. Abrams, the new P.O. manager.

473
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,149
Mr. Zounds.

474
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,719
Mr. Zounds!

475
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,359
That's a good one.

476
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,236
Don't laugh at my ignorance!

477
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,469
We didn't mean it.

478
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,877
So smug with that accent,
smelly cheese and red brick houses!

479
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,239
We're sorry.

480
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,755
Where are you going?

481
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,474
To work.
Laugh with your friend.

482
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,274

Never heard of the shouth.

557
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,588

00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:26,951
Picalily.

570
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,999
Oh, it's gypsy food.

571
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,674
No, it's a local delicashy.

572
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,553
It's good.

573

What's in it?

574
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,712
Can't ask what'sh in it.

575
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,913
In the north, everyone knowsh
what'sh in the fricadelle.

576
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,309
Nobody shays it.

577
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,278
Like Americans and Coco.

578
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,915

Charming little church.

585

Not a church.

586
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,068
It'sh not religioush at all.
Our belfry.

587
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,794
In the Middle Agesh,

588
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,316

00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,191

Ashk Antoine to take you.
He'sh the carilloneur.

591
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,829
Carilloneur?.

592
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,516
Up there, there are over 50 chimes,
called a carillon.

593
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,076
Only Antoine can play.
It's come down father-to-son.

594
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,635
When he plays, it's beautiful.

595
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,359
It's heard for miles.

596
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,756
True.

597
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,679
Fries and a beer.

598
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,558

599
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,510

00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,309

I know him! The shoutherner.

Not frozen yet?

606
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,669
Something wrong?

607
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,675

And he barricaded the door!
Afraid I would fall in love?

610
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,270
A little respect. I don't want
to cite you on my first day.

611
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,549
I'm sho afraid!

612

Our treat.

613
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,833
Don't they shay thank you
where you come from?

614
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,113
Antoine, enough.
You should be ashamed.

615
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,709
He just arrived.

616
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,509
What if they shpoke to you
like that in the shouth?

617
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,148
I know Antoine well.
He's a good guy.

618
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,430
That's no reason to insult me.

619
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,193
And there's no drinking on duty.

620
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,992
Hish mother is hard on him.

621
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,599
That's no excuse.

622
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,550
You're giviing him the citation?

623
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,995
Forget something?

624
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,519
- How are you?
- What is it?

625
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,153
We all got together.

626
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,238
We all chipped in
to furnish your place.

627
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,315
A shkair!

628
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,710
Eclectic,
but it'sh an improvement.

629
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,872
A flea market
minush the pricetagsh.

630
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,160
Very nice of you.
You shouldn't have.

631
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,393
But I'm a little shad.

00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,476
Why?.

633
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,832
To shtop shleeping with you.

634
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,359
How can I thank you?
Outside of the fry shack.

635
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,996
We can have dinner in Vieux-Lille.

636
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,679
No, my back hurtsh.

637
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,553
You eat with your mouth,
not your back!

638
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,352
Know Vieux-Lille, sir?.

639
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,750
Another of your smelly cheeses?

640
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,594
Yesh, but also a nice town.

641
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,912

I like the chicon au gratin.

644
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,509
The shish-kebab?

645
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,190
No, the chicon au gratin.
Endives in white sauce and cheese.

646
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,112
Alsho the maroilles pie.

647
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,514
I know maroilles.

648
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,917
He can't leave here
before he tastes the carbonade.

649
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,479
- The what?
- The carbonade.

650
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,875
It's like a shtew, but with beer.

651
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,713
Can't order everything!

652
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,837
A little of each, and we'll share.

653
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,555
There you go.

654
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,873
It's not hard to speak shtimi.
For example,

655
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,237
we don't shay, "Sorry,
I didn't quite follow your drift."

656
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,350
We say, "Huh? "

657
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,518
That shounds like ha, ha.

658

659

Great!

660
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,912

of each sentence. Try it.

663
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,709
I got it, huh?

664
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,591
Perfect!

665
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,716
You're shpeaking Shti.

666
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,631
Fuck.

667
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,316
No, we don't shay "fuck" like you.
We shay "Vandeus!"

668
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,595
Vandeus, huh?

669
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,308
Lovely, biloute.

670
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,276
Who?

671
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,389
Biloute.
That'sh a generic nickname here.

672
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,155
What does it mean?

673
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,513
It means...

674
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,795
It means nothing.

675
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,153
It means little weenie.

676
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,470
It doesn't mean weenie.
It's a term of endearment.

677
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,679
Oh, I see.

678
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,394
Teach me dirty words.
That's important to learn.

679
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,428
Instead of "shit,"
we say da braun.

680
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,796
"Asshole" is boubourse.

681
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,675
Where I come from,
we say couillosti..

682
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,796
How pretty!

683
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,439
"God damn" is millard.

684
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,830
Millard! Da braun, huh?

685
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,428
I also noticed that instead of "me"
you say "yo".

686
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,596
No, I mean "me" is "mo"

687
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,717
and instead of "you" it's "yo".

688
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,955
Like S is SH

689
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,513
and SH is shka.

690
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,993
Like for example,
fish are fishkas!

691
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,275
Right!

692
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,876
You order.

693
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,876
That way you can practish.

694
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,917
Good idea. Sakadon.

695
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,150
What?

696
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,395
Sakadon.

697
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,868
What's that mean?

698
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,272
It means, don't be afraid, boss.

699
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,469
Excush me!

700
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,272
From the gut.

701
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,310
Good evening.

702
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,909
Evening, biloute.

703
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,280
Mo and the posh offish shtaff want...

704
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,669
Wont.

705
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,833
We wont...

706
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,793
to order

707
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,793
the shame again pleash.

708
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,511
Sorry, I'm not Shtimi.
I'm from Paris. I didn't get that.

709
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,989
Philippe, are you all right?

710
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,195
What's the matter?.

711
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,592
You were supposed to call
when you arrived.

712
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,590
Shit.

713
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,631
I thought something happened.

714
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,518
I'm so sorry.

715
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,792
It's just...

716
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,319
a little complicated.

717
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,797
- What did they do?
- Nothing. I didn't want to worry you.

718
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,230
But now... all is well.

719
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,229
Honey, you can tell me.

720
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,629
Tell you what?

721
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,869
It's horrible, right?

722
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,036
It's actually not that bad.

723
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:32,990
Sure,

724
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:37,518
it's the north. But it's not so cold
and people are very...

725
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,028
What's the word?

726
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:39,996
Friendly.

727
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,278
Stop it, please.

728
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,074
- Stop what?
- Don't lie to me again.

729
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,396
Don't act strong to spare me.

730
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,553
You can tell me the worst.
I'm your wife.

731
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,636
It's true.

732
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,517
Philippe!

733
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,475
It's true. It's terrible.
I'm suffering.

734
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,196
It's horrible.

735
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,033
See? I know you.

736
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,836
My poor dear.

737
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,275
Come home quick, I'll see to you.

738
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,276
These two weeks will be long.
It's going to be a nightmare.

739
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,795
I 'm proud of your sacrifice for us.

740
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,508
I love you.

741
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,832
I love you, too.

742
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,715
You all right?

743
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,874
Antoine, how are you?

744
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,308
Fine, and you?

745
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,749
Morning, Yann.

746
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,476
Have a good day!

747
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,079
Rue Nationale.

748
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,553
Have a good one.

749
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,116
It's open.

750
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,429
Two weeks flew by!

751
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,308
Careful on the road.
It's a long trip.

752
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,193
Drive carefully.

753
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,512
Call us when you get there.
Ring twice, we'll know it's you.

754
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,199
You're not his mother.

755
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,958
- See you Monday.
- Have a nice weekend.

756
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,599
Thanks. Where's Antoine?

757
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,273
It's his carillon day.

758
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,999
Don't you hear him?

759
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,589
He's playing?

760
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,989
He's very good.

761
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,515
The besht.

762
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:08,995
Dad!

763
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,794
You're not in bed?

764
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,116
Mom said I could wait up.

765
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,993
- Let's see your toes.
- I've got them all.

766
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,229
Honey.

767
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,759
How was the trip?

768
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,076
- You're wan, but not too thin.
- I'm fine.

769
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,033
- I'll put Raphael to bed.
- Let me see your toes!

770
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,438
I didn't lose any!

771
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,711
It's all right, Mom, he's fine!

772
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,273
- Night, pal.
- Night, Dad.

773
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,357
Pleasant dreams, little man.

774
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,793
Have some more bouillabaisse.
It's good. I made it yesterday.

775
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,558
Always better the next day.

776
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,598
Have some pistou soup.

777
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,552
Or some tapenade on bread?

778
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,751
- No, thanks.
- You love that.

779
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,951
I'm not very hungry.

780
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,510
Cry. If you need to, go ahead.

781
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:06,675
I can't.

782
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,233
What happened up there?

783
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,510
It's hard to talk about it.

784
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,398
Are they horrible to you?

785
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,789
They're...

786
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,760
Well, they drink.
All of them. A lot.

787
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,953
That's all they have.

788
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,509
The Middle Ages.
When they speak, it's all like...

789
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,914
Sure, alcoholics.

790
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,792
Not really alcoholics.
They drink to keep warm.

791
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,076
But it's always cold.

792
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,793
What a nightmare.

793
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,108
My darling.

794
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,158
This will hold you 2 weeks.

795
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,790
It went by so fast.
Wish I could stay one more day.

796
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,835
Be strong.

797
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,870
Present.

798
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,755
Fleece-lined.

799
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,670
Put it on.

800
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,156
It's not that cold up there.

801
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,320
Don't be overprotective of me.
Put it on.

802
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,918
100 miles an hour.
You're doing better.

803
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:39,711
Yes, thanks.

804
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,399
Not going to the north?

805
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,670
Yes, but I actually like it.

806
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,356
Good, I'm happy for you.

807
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,109
It'll cost you 150 euros.

808
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,396
Da braun!

809
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,476
What?

810
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,115
Nothing.

811
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,153
Step out.

812
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,313
- Hello.
- Zounds!

813
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,359
- It'sh cloudish.
- Gonna muck!

814
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,917
Antoine, for the sorting center manager.
It's urgent.

815
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,950
Call me and tell me he has it.

816
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,599
I'll call and shay whot.

817
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,038
That he has it.

818
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,277
Right. I'll call and shay whot.

819
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,391
I just told you what.

820
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,752
- I got it.
- You'll call me.

821
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,348
Yesh.

822
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,996
I give it to him, then call
and I'll shay whot.

823
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,754
I don't know.

824
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,235
Something like,
"Hi, it's Antoine.

825
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,189
"I just gave it to the manager."
Is that clear?.

826
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,352
Yesh. I'm no boubourse.
I'll call you.

827
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,794
Good, call me.

828
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:42,836
And shay whot.

829
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,675
Look at me.

830
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,151
Are you drunk?.

831
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:54,076
Boss, "I'll shay whot" is Shtimi for
"I'll let you know what's up."

832
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,479
Oh, I see.

833
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:57,955
Sorry, Bailleul.

834
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,350
Forget it.

835
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,828
Call me and say what.

836
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,270
That he got the envelope, right?

837
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,954
Thank you, fans.
The players are back!

838
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,315
Take dish.

839
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,198
My kid forgot his lunchka.

840
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,916
My Antoine ish mighty impreshkonable.

841
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,918
Don't lead him around
all the time with you.

842
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,952
No fry shack every day.

843
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,479
Can I count on you?

844
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,196
Yes, ma'am.

845
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,515
Dishgushting.

846
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,272
My lipsh are shealed
but don't ashk what I think.

847
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,556
Heavensh.

848
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,398
There. Shorry it took a while.

849
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,909
Bye.

850
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,555
Next!

851
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,753
Hello, can I help you?

852
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,632
I need thish weighed and shtamped.

853
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,716
Pretty shtamps.

854
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,991
For my shon. He collectsh them.

855
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,315
How shweet.

856
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,394
These all right? With a hedgehog.

857
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,274
Perfect.

858
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,028
The envelope.

859
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,117
Vandeus! 26 kilos!

860
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,076
Can't be. It's in grams.

861
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,988
Right. I was thinking, what'sh in it?

862
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,676
17 hedgehogs.

863
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,480
That can't be.
How much is each stamp?

864
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,437
Mind if I mix owls in, too?

865
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,669
I'm out of hedgehogs.

866
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,518
You're making a mistake.

867
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,956
There'sh not enough room
for all these hedgehogsh.

868
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,515
I'll have to put shome
on the other side.

869
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,711
17 stamps for 26 grams.

870
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,276
It can't be. It's a mistake.

871
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,997
I swallowed some owls.
I won't charge you.

872
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,428
Stop it!

873
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,116
Give me that. Move.

874
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,232
I'll take care of this.
We won't charge you. It's on us.

875
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,953
I'll take care of it.

876
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,594
Be right there.

877
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,039
- Remember?.
- Stop.

878
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,515
Go home and rest.

879
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,317
What would I do without you?

880
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,074
You wouldn't drink
and it would do you good.

881
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,716
- Well?
- Fantastic!

882
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,075
Nice, right?

883
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:19,995
How are you doing?

884
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,589
Always good by the shore.
I can't bray.

885
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,075
- Bray?.
- It means cry.

886
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,513
- How do you say laugh?
- Laugh is laugh.

887
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:29,710
Same word.

888
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,037
We got to shpeak a little Frenchka
now and then.

889
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,313
Everything OK at work?.

890
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,759
Great.

891
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,432
By the way, I'm speaking for all of us.

892
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,074
We're happy you're our manager.

893
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,793
Thanksh Antoine.

894
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,793
Your region is really very friendly.

895
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,274
Maybe so,

896
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,869
but with no one to welcome,
who cares?

897
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,433
So we thank you.

898
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,153
Don't mention it. Huh?

899
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,198
There's a Shtimi proverb.

900
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,631
When a stranger comes north
he brays twice.

901
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,956
When he arrives and when he leaves.

902
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,678
I was a bit down at first.

903
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,598
Just wait till you leave!

904
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,074
We'll shee.

905
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,679
The south is my home.

906
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,677
We'll shee.

907
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,358
And 30.

908
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,910
Bye, Ma'am.

909
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,395
What do we have on for tonight?

910
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,553
Sir, it's Friday.

911
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,035
- Aren't you going home?
- To the shouth.

912
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,115
Friday already?.

913
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,074
Vandeus!

914
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,599
Surprise!

915
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,070
Your friends came to cheer you up.

916
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,391
- Dad!
- Hey, little man.

917
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,988
Julie told us how hard it is up there.

918
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:15,075
When I open up it's still night.
Sunrise is at 1 1 :30.

919
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,794
And at 5, boom!
Night falls again.

920
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:22,229
They're all so...
All of them. Pale, white.

921
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,159
They don't get much light.

922
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:27,511
And the hygiene!
Last week, an epidemic started.

923
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,312
Cholera.

924
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,430
You got vaccinated?

925
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,439
I'm going to have to.

926
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:38,959
We'll check your boosters.

927
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,559
It's worse than hell.

928
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,634
Strange. I worked up north.
I have good memories.

929
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,273
Next weekend in Belgium?

930
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,674
Could be nice.

931
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:03,874
I have to work.

932
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,631
You don't like him seeing us?

933
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,909
No, that's not it.

934
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,235
So kish me.

935
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,635
Don't be ridiculous.
See you tonight.

936
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,273
- Kish me!
- That hurts!

937
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,669
Problem, Annabelle?

938
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,229
No, I'm fine.

939
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:17,350
What is it, mailman?

940
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,710
What you want?

941
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,029
Got mail for me?

942
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,468
Stop, Tony.

943
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,552
No mail, but a text message.

944
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,591
You can't read, so here it is.

945
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:26,556
Stop.

946
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:31,715
No parking in front of the post office.
Signed, Postman.

947
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,478
Where's your mother?.

948
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,394
Picking up after you?

949
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,274
Stop it!

950
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,754
Chime boy, want to fight?

951
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,190
I oppose viiolence
between humans.

952
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,072
However, with objects...

953
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,988
You're sick!

954
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:50,635
Stop!

955
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,750
Stop that.
Come on, give me a hand!

956
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,030
Stop it.

957
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,349
Mr. Abrams...

958
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,193
- He's not well.
- He's fine.

959
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,879
- He's not answering.
- He's fine.

960
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,672
Come on, boss.

961
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,359
He can't shay no.

962
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,953
You know how it is.

963
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,630
You go see people,
bring the mail,

964
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,229
so it's "Have a little drink."

965
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,635
Little by little...

966
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,713
He winds up fighting outside,
in uniform. That's intolerable.

967
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,353
He can't say no. I say stop!

968
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,670
An official reprimand is a lot.

969
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,319
Are you defending him?

970
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,278
I'm not defending him.

971
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,309
I want him to get better.

972
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,670
Reprimanding him won't help.

973
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,309
You know what Antoine's problem is?

974
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:44,874
He's in love with you.

975
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,914
Well actually...

976
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,879
we were together for a year.

977
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:51,996
Why'd you leave?

978
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:53,949
He left me.

979
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:55,909
I don't understand.

980
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,071
I was very much in love.

981
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:01,033
I stood up to his mother,
who's very overbearing.

982
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,108
I got very mad.

983
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,638
And I told Antoine to choose.
He chose her.

984
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,952
So? I'm a postal manager,
not a social worker.

985
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,990
Beautiful, Antoine. Keep playing.

986
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,390
Are you here to give me
a music degree or a reprimand?

987
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,596
Why don't you talk
to your mother?.

988
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:22,110
I spoke to Annabelle.
Your mom's the source of the problem.

989
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,597
I have to be kind to my mom.
She's had a hard life.

990
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,434
By not telling her
what's on your mind?

991
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,959
We're all the same.

992
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,953
I love my wife,
but I lie to her all weekend.

993
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:41,797
Why?.

994
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,274
It's a long story.

995
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,560
- I didn't know you were married.
- I am.

996
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,837
Then why doesn't she come
and live here with you?

997
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,919
My wife is...

998
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:57,318
Depressed. Clinically, even.

999
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,671
If she came north, she'd get worse.

1000
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:01,790
Why?.

1001
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:05,396
I mean, it would be worse
for her to leave home.

1002
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:06,516
Wherever she went.

1003
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:08,835
I see.

1004
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:11,196
Antoine, all I'm asking

1005
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,118
is to go easy at work.

1006
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:16,909
Drinking won't make it better.
It can only get worse.

1007
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,599
I acted like a babash.

1008
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,755
We all make mistakes.

1009
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,076
What counts is how you fix it.

1010
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:25,715
It can't be fixed.

1011
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,518
You can fix anything.

1012
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,279
Except maybe his motorcycle.

1013
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,716
You want to try?.

1014
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,831
- What?
- The carillon!

1015
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,074
You must know a tune.
It's like a piano.

1016
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,798
Everyone will hear.

1017
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,831
Plug in the earphones.

1018
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,274
Go ahead, biloute.

1019
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,073
Not that one.

1020
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,549
Not easy.

1021
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:52,670
Higher.

1022
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:09,919
Antoine, wait!

1023
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,033
I'm coming with you.

1024
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,394
I know my route.

1025
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:17,512
I'm coming along.
You have to learn to say no.

1026
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,359
You're the bosh.

1027
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,356
Hey, biloute!

1028
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,316
Mr. Mahieux.

1029
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:43,114
Hi. Philippe Abrams,
the post office manager.

1030
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,759
Nice of you to come.

1031
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,075
Come in a minute.

1032
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,911
No, thank you Mr. Mahieux.
We'll be moviing on.

1033
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,473
Too early for cocktails.

1034
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:55,511
- How about coffee?
- That's different. Fine.

1035
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,029
- A little juniper?.
- Not for me.

1036
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,356
No, thank you.

1037
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:03,358
It'll warm you up.
A southerner like yourshelf!

1038
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:08,594
I can't drink that.

1039
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,750
It's a local specialty. Just taste.

1040
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,518
It disinfects.

1041
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,189
To your health!

1042
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,118
Sugar takes the edge off.

1043
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,236
Sugar?.

1044
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,034
No sugar!

1045
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,273
Thanks for the coffee.

1046
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,509
Don't mention it.

1047
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,676
Come back any time.

1048
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,233
See you tomorrow.

1049
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,398
Have a good day.

1050
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,428
You see, Antoine,

1051
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,753
how one can be cordial
with a customer,

1052
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,632
while drinking only coffee.

1053
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,034
Yes, I see.

1054
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:58,195
But that's it!

1055
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,475
There are limits!

1056
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,513
- No more jennifer.
- Juniper.

1057
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:09,870
Don't ring the bell!
They'll offer us a drink.

1058
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,354
It's registered.

1059
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:14,950
That's different.
But no going inside. No drinking.

1060
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:17,910
Come in!

1061
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:21,795
No, we'll stay at the door.
It's too dangerous.

1062
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,636
You. Voice sounded familiar.

1063
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,116
Mr. Vasseur. What a nice surprise.

1064
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,197
Registered letter. Sign here.

1065
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:37,313
Guess what. I speak fluent Shtimi.
I understand you now.

1066
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,909
Perfect Shtimi, written and oral!

1067
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,195
Let's celebrate.

1068
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,719
Come in, we'll toast.

1069
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:48,196
- Any juniper?.
- Juniper?.

1070
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,039
No. I never touch alcohol.

1071
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,631
I might have a wee yellow,
like in your neck of the woods.

1072
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,159
I got it as a gift.

1073
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,112
- Yellow?.
- Pastis.

1074
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,393
Pastis, just like home.
A little yellow!

1075
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,430
I won't drink.

1076
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,678
A little pastis won't hurt you.

1077
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,189
I better not.

1078
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,118
Just one, I'll close my eyes.

1079
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,196
I'd rather not.

1080
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,915
Bailleul! It's an order.
Comes from upstairs!

1081
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,151
- Lots of water.
- If you like.

1082
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,509
Here kids.

1083
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,879
Don't pour it higher than the glass.

1084
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,191
Firm. Stop. Nyet.

1085
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,119
- My block.
- Look out for your mother!

1086
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:36,674

1091
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,269
That's lovely.

1092
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,558
So beautiful.

1093
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,595
Hi, biloutes!
It's the mailman!

1094
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,910
No need to say hello each time.

1095
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,348
I'm thirsty!

1096
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,551
See how I turned down
that fifth beer, Antoine?

1097
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:26,749
Firm!

1098
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:28,948
Cordial, but firm.

1099
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,549
You shouldn't have.
It was picon beer.

1100
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,718
I love it,
and it doesn't get you drunk.

1101
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,878
Now we have to stop.
Everything with moderation!

1102
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,479
- The magic word?
- Thanksh.

1103
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,159
No! The word is no!

1104
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:43,270
No thanksh.

1105
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:44,435
Right.

1106
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:51,077
I love your region, Antoine.
I love it.

1107
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,511
I love the north!

1108
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,589
And you too. I adore you.

1109
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,236
I like you too, sir.

1110
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,555
Call me Philippe, Antoine.

1111
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,470
Vandeus! Da braun!

1112
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:19,835
My stomach hurts.

1113
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:23,874
Long as it'sh not your ash,
you can shtill shkit!

1114
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,833
Hi, Antoine. Sir.

1115
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:41,069
It's OK. He opened the door.
You can stop ringing now.

1116
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:44,636
Mr. Leborgne,
there's no mail for you.

1117
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,068
But we'll have a drink.

1118
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:47,918
To toast our friendship.

1119
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,430
Come in.

1120
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,469
Want to race, Antoine?

1121
01:08:58,680 --> 01:08:59,795
No, no racing.

1122
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,878
Last one to the post office
is a double boubourse!

1123
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,156
Watch out! The stop sign!
Philippe!

1124
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,516
Come on! We can lose them!

1125
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:21,995
Stop!

1126
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,269
Goshk, my ash!

1127
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:38,595
You all right?

1128
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,313
- Who are you?
- Police.

1129
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:43,432
I work for the government too.
Bergues Post Office.

1130
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,392
Come on, we're taking you in.

1131
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,068
Shtop it, biloute.
We're all Shti here.

1132
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:49,429
I'm Shti now, right?

1133
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:55,194
Hey, biloute. Don't be a babash!

1134
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,753
Calm down, sir.

1135
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,792
Come on, aren't you shti?.

1136
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,878
You're not. Let me see.
You're not a shti.

1137
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:03,918
He's not shti.

1138
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,393
Let's all go to the french fry
shack for fricadelle!

1139
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,555
Momo!

1140
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:13,718
Four fricadelles, Momo!

1141
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,351
We haven't eaten yet!

1142
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,437
No! Hang on, hang on.

1143
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:26,871
Honey?.

1144
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:31,272
Can't come home tonight, hon.
I'm at the police station.

1145
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,351
Philippe, were you mugged?

1146
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,751
No. I just had
a little to drink.

1147
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,628
So I got arrested.

1148
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:39,590
In your car?

1149
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:40,994
On a bicycle.

1150
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,674
Why were you drunk, on a bicycle?

1151
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,271
Saying no to liquor.

1152
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,556
Oh my darling, what's going on?

1153
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,951
Don't try to drown your sorrows.

1154
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,797
I know it's hard. Be strong.

1155
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,035
All right.

1156
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:03,472
I have to go. They're sobering me up.
I love you.

1157
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,557
Me too. More than anything.

1158
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:29,955
Well?

1159
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,469
Well what?

1160
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,474
Let's see your hands.

1161
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:39,034
No trembling. Two days sober.
No side effects?

1162
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,395
I'm fine.

1163
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:44,755
Oh no!

1164
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,069
What is it?

1165
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:51,757
You drank my perfume?
I read where alcoholics do that.

1166
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,194
No, I'm holding up.

1167
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:57,195
I'd rather go get you a bottle
than have you drink my Givenchy.

1168
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,234
What's this?

1169
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:13,750
Julie.

1170
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:16,030
I was weak. I'm sorry.

1171
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,309
What's all this?

1172
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,397
My bags. I'm coming with you.

1173
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,713
What about Raphael?

1174
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,712
My parents will mind him.

1175
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,195
We'll find him a school up north.

1176
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,511
What about your store?
Your job?

1177
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,598
I took a leave of absence.
I'm coming north with you.

1178
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:33,669
No, Julie.

1179
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:39,118
I'm scared, but I'm happy
to be going with you.

1180
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:40,753
We'll stay together.

1181
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,631
We'll be stronger together.

1182
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,553
Got your seatbelt on?

1183
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:53,988
Of course.

1184
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:56,993
He's a maniac!

1185
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,798
What speed were you doing?

1186
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:20,910
The right one.

1187
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,196
We're taking you for a blood test.

1188
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,555
My husband didn't drink.

1189
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,233
He may have perfumed his mouth.

1190
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,112
Don't worry.
Go with the tow truck.

1191
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,150
I'm staying with you.

1192
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:32,557
Go back, reassure everyone.
Take care of the insurance.

1193
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:33,556
I'll take the train.

1194
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:34,956
Good idea.

1195
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,635
All right, but you be careful.

1196
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,558
I'll come as soon as I can.

1197
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:40,590
Great.

1198
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,394
Come into my office.

1199
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,428
We have to talk.

1200
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,394
This is very serious.

1201
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,476
What ish it?

1202
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:50,795
My wife's coming tomorrow.

1203
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:51,989
Good news.

1204
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:53,474
Not really.

1205
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,876
- Marriage not good?
- Yes it is.

1206
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,440
Since we've been 700 miles apart,
it's great.

1207
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:03,071
My wife is depressed.

1208
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,679
It helps her
to know I'm in the north.

1209
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,680
She focuses on a concrete problem.

1210
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,476
I'm not sure I understand.

1211
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,434
I lied about you.

1212
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,598
She thinks I'm in a liviing hell.
The more I suffer,

1213
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:20,637
the better she feels.

1214
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:21,989
Pretty twisted.

1215
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:23,309
Maybe, but it works.

1216
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,556
We have never been so happy.

1217
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,916
What did you tell her about us?

1218
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:35,439
A few clichs.

1219
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,958
General notions.
I didn't make anything up.

1220
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:42,270
I said you were a little...

1221
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:43,629
basic.

1222
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,233
A little...

1223
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:46,994
simple,

1224
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,072
a little rough.

1225
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,838
At times vulgar.

1226
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,114
Dense.

1227
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,033
Backward, too.

1228
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,038
And a few other things.

1229
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:41,876
Hello, my love.

1230
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,473
This is very pretty.

1231
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,954
Honey, I have something to confess.

1232
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,597
Welcome to the north, Julie!

1233
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:11,955
Welcome kish!

1234
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:13,036
Welcome to the north!

1235
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:20,869
Come on!

1236
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,234
Drink up!

1237
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,195
We'll take care of the bosh' wife.

1238
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:47,714
That'sh for sure!

1239
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:55,915
Get out of here!

1240
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:00,950
Back to your shack!
Don't come back in the morn!

1241
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:03,474
Where are we?

1242
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:05,159
In Bergues, honey.

1243
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:06,875
Evening.

1244
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:10,234
Look at all these mushelsh!

1245
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:13,754
What'sh the two looking at?
Never sheen me?

1246
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,594
Shtop your crapping, Ma!

1247
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,794
Who are these people?

1248
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,150
They're miners, from the mine.

1249
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:28,469
Aren't they closed?

1250
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:29,954
Not thish one.

1251
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:33,914
Not much left, but even closed,
we live inshide it!

1252
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,712
Where should we go?

1253
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,709
Vandeus! Dirty kid!

1254
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:46,194
All the shame.

1255
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,277
I'll shlap him shilly!

1256
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,875
Shee you later.

1257
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,439
That'sh Shity Hall.

1258
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:06,032
Down there's the posht offish,
and ballroom. No more balls.

1259
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,073
It's worse than you said.

1260
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:11,750
I tried to warn you.
I didn't want you to see this.

1261
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,673
No! You live here?

1262
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:34,910
Yes.

1263
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,475
It has southern exposure.
Good light.

1264
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,192
I forgot. Dinner ish at 9.

1265
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:42,992
Don't be late!

1266
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,515
Can't we eat alone?

1267
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:50,469
No, it's the welcome meal.
If we don't go, I'll pay.

1268
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,873
Make conversation.

1269
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,879
Nice eating outside.

1270
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:21,112
Can't stay late,
cause of the jackals.

1271
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,154
What are we eating?

1272
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:26,230
Meat.

1273
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,029
What kind?

1274
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,072
Depends what we find.

1275
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,469
Shit! Missed.

1276
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:39,320
Fabrice, we got enough. Come eat.

1277
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:41,110
Coming.

1278
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:49,238
Dinner's served!

1279
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:04,869
I can't.

1280
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:07,439
Pass me some bread.

1281
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,155
Tomorrow,

1282
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,960
we'll go to the mine
to play hide-and-seek.

1283
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:29,269
Good.

1284
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:30,549
Hide-and-seek.

1285
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,995
Did they go sleep at the mine?

1286
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:44,154
I doubt it. It's only 1 AM.

1287
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:50,312
You can hear the neighbors.
What are they saying?

1288
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:54,234
They're fighting.
Like almost every night.

1289
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,636
There. It's settled.

1290
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,708
Someone's dead?

1291
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,990
He fires to calm his wife down.

1292
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,276
What a nightmare.

1293
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,875
How could you ever make it
two years?

1294
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:17,196
How could you stand it this long?

1295
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:20,273
I could use a drink.

1296
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:24,348
You have to go back. I'll take you
to the train in the morning.

1297
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:26,196
All right.

1298
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:29,071
To get the rest of my things.

1299
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,350
It's clear Raphael can't come.

1300
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,160
He'll stay with my parents
2 years if necessary,

1301
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:35,509
I'll stay with you.

1302
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,199
You can't. I don't want you to.

1303
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:40,958
I love you.
If it's your life, it's mine too.

1304
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:48,310
Well?

1305
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,511
Nothing. Maybe they're sleeping.

1306
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:54,153
Should we finish it off
with a fire?

1307
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:55,755
Are you crazy?.

1308
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:57,075
You're babash.

1309
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,794
Sure, if I shuggest it,
it's da braun.

1310
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,718
The shot was a good idea.

1311
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:04,670
Another?.

1312
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,269
No, Yann. That'sh enough now.

1313
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:08,790
Let'sh go home.

1314
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:14,836
Not coming?

1315
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,114
Shomeone hash to be here
in the morning.

1316
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,079
Yeah, right.

1317
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:22,550
Annabelle, wait.

1318
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:27,551
Maybe you should sleep here too.

1319
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,118
Antoine, please.

1320
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,596
If I'm alone tomorrow morning,
she might get suspicious.

1321
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:38,750
Right now, I'm suspicious.

1322
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:43,876
For once, we're together in Bergues
without my mom.

1323
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:47,829
Good night.

1324
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,357
- Did it go all right?
- No.

1325
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,149
Me neither.

1326
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:36,430
- She wants to stay.
- In the north?

1327
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:38,033
No. Right here.

1328
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:43,834
We dissuaded her in every way,
she's still willing to stay.

1329
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,189
Why?.

1330
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:46,868
Because she loves me.

1331
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:48,672
Oh millard. Da braun.

1332
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:52,395
I fought to get to the Riviiera,
to save my couple

1333
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,750
and here in the north,
it all works out!

1334
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,552
That's great if it works out.

1335
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:59,194
But what now?.
She won't leave this dump!

1336
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,595
- Tell her the truth?
- No.

1337
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:04,508
My wife loves me.
I should ruin that with truth?

1338
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:06,278
- Coward.
- I'm not a coward.

1339
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,516
You are. Your wife loves you.
You're here

1340
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:11,075
and you can't level with her.
Be a Shti.

1341
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:15,990
I won't listen to a boubourse who's 35
and can't stand up to mom!

1342
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:17,555
What did you shay?.

1343
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,233
You're no braver than me.

1344
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,468
I can talk to my mom any time.

1345
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:23,550
Then do it.

1346
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,116
Go talk to your wife and butt out.

1347
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,316
Fine. You, your mother.
Me, my wife.

1348
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:40,588
Mrs. Abrams!

1349
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:54,389
Can I help you?

1350
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,036
I'm lost. The Bergues post office?

1351
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:58,156
Bergues?

1352
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:00,399
This isn't Bergues.

1353
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:01,550
It isn't?

1354
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:04,189
No, it's the old mining viillage.

1355
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,799
Bergue's over that way.

1356
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:07,310
Oh.

1357
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,069
Thanks.

1358
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:10,595
Get on.

1359
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:11,830
I'll drop you off.

1360
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,432
Get on, I won't bite you.

1361
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:42,754
My wife is missing.

1362
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,269
No. She's waiting for you upstairs.

1363
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:48,157
I had to tell her.

1364
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:06,196
No palace, but it's livable.

1365
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:10,588
The Shtis lent me furniture.
They're very nice.

1366
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,152
You've been lying for months.

1367
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:16,874
I tried to tell you.
You wouldn't believe me.

1368
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:18,638
I said what you wanted to hear.

1369
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,996
That whole act so I wouldn't stay.

1370
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:23,711
It was going great between us.

1371
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,839
We separated
so we'd be better together. No?

1372
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,758
I'm going back south.

1373
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:46,076
Ah, little biloute.

1374
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:47,668
Mail for your mom?

1375
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,959
No, we have to talk.

1376
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,156
What'sh the matter?. You shick?.

1377
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:53,999
You catchka something?

1378
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:03,957
Jush lishen, don't talk.
Whatever you shay won't matter.

1379
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:06,549
Becaush it ish the way it ish.
That'sh all. OK?.

1380
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,074
I didn't shay a word.

1381
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:12,876
I'm leaviing the housh.

1382
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:16,360
I'm getting my own plashe,
with Annabelle.

1383
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,790
Maybe you don't, but I love her.

1384
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,514
And she's the one I chooshe.

1385
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:23,632
Now, what do you shay?.

1386
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:25,713
It'sh about time!

1387
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,480
I wash wondering when
you would finally do it.

1388
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:31,909
You're not mad?

1389
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:34,355
Why should I be mad?

1390
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:36,238
That'sh all a mother could want.

1391
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:38,670
For her shon to find happinesh.

1392
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:42,597
I didn't raise you for myshelf.

1393
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:46,112
And if one day,

1394
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,597

or a wee biloutesh,

I'd be very happy.

1396
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,110
All right.

1397
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:01,238
Anything elshe?
I have to finish my potatoesh.

1398
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,591
Take some time to think.

1399
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,788
Just know I'm right here,
if you need me.

1400

01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,348
My love to Raphael.

1402
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,348
Hello, Annabelle.

1403
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:57,517
Mrs. Bailleul. Can I help you?

1404
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,593
I came to congratulate you.
Well done.

1405
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,872
You won my shon.

1406
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:05,913
I'm leaviing him alone now.

1407
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,872
I'm done.
I don't watch him anymore.

1408
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,478
From today on,

1409
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:15,719
I'm watching both of you.

1410
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:18,639
And you better be happy,
or you'll deal with me!

1411
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,075
Got it?

01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:31,989
All my besht.

01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:34,114
Thanksh.

1414
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:48,989
That wash playing
when I met Annabelle.

1415
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:53,113
He'sh one of ush.
Shti Veewonder.

1416
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,231
Sorry, don't feel like laughing.

1417
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,994
I didn't even ask you
how it went for you?

1418
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,156
Great. I talked to my mom.

1419
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,191
I shed I'm marrying Annabelle.

1420
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,270
How'd she react?

1421
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:09,394
She wantsh a wee bilout or biloutesh.

1422
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:11,070
Fantastic.

1423
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:13,836
Now I just have to tell Annabelle.

1424
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:16,150
You haven't?

1425
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:18,398
I'm afraid she'll say no.

1426
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:19,709
Still with the biker?.

1427
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,116
I don't know. I hope not.

1428
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:29,192
It's you, sir?. What is it?

1429
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,032
I need you. It's urgent.

1430
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:33,431
At this hour?.
Can't it wait?

1431
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,790
It's an order!
Come down, please.

1432
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:48,830
Stay right there. Don't move.

1433
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:01,873
She's downstairs. Ready?.

1434
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:04,275
- I have stagefright.
- Go! Sakadon!

1435
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,436
ANNABELLE,
I LOVE YOU

1436
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,279
MARRY ME BILOUTE

1437

Before you answer,
I left my mother.

1438
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:03,629
I know.

1439
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:05,395
She told me.

1440
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,388
Then it's yesh?

1441
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:19,999
It'sh very pretty.

1442
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:22,676
I have no shkeets now.

1443
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:25,314
Took you long enough,
Antoine Bailleul.

1444
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,950
When we met, we could be anywhere.

1445
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:30,230
We were happy, just being together.

1446
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,313
How could we forget that?

1447
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:34,468
I love you.

1448
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,195
I want you to come live in the north.

1449
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,717
I don't want us to be apart.

1450
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:42,830
Ever again.

1451
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:57,679
Dad, Mom...

1452
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:59,757
Why are you kissing in public?

1453
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:03,278
Let's go lose some toes.

1454
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:35,509
Mail.

1455
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:37,913
For you, Philippe.

1456
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:43,872
Shit. It's H.R.

1457
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:47,273
Been three yearsh.
Had to happen one day.

1458
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:58,317
Well?

1459
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:01,355
Porquerolles.

1460
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:03,192
That's great.

1461
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:08,668
See you tonight.

1462
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,596
You managersh are all the shame.

1463
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:17,758
Come out of nowhere.
Got to get ushed to you.

1464
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:20,429
Jusht when everyone's happy,
you leave.

1465
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:21,959
Quit bitching.

1466
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:26,148
For the road. It's chicory.

1467
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,550
And beer for you.

1468
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:40,955
We'll see you for vacations. Right?

1469
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:44,948
The shouth isn't good as the north.
But it'sh not half bad.

1470
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,069
Thanks for everything.

1471
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:01,198
You don't have to thank me.

1472
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:05,755
Yes, I do.

1473
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:07,434
See? I was right.

1474
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:08,715
About what?

1475
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:13,359
A stranger in the north brays twice.
When he arrives, when he leaves.

1476
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:16,196
I'm not crying.

1477
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:17,429
Yesh you are.

1478
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:20,550
No, I'm not.

1479
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:22,478
Yesh, you are.

1480
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:27,472
No, you're not crying.

1481
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:56,629
for my mother, Danile, a wonderful Shti

1482
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:40,559
Took the furniture?

1483
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:42,512
For hish offish.

1484
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:44,795
What fish?

1485
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:47,630
Not furnished?

1486
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:50,673
The old manager
took it with him.

1487
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,269
Why?.

1488
01:37:57,640 --> 01:37:59,437
Why give furniture to fish?

1489
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:05,911
Fish, dish.
You all talk like that?

1490
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:08,315
The Shtimis all talk Shtimi.

1491
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:10,397
And Flemish, but hey.

1492
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:11,715
Sorry.

1493
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:15,990
Boubourse. Where I come from
we say a custayi.

1494
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:26,475
Hi, biloute!

1495
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:16,680

Nice of you to come shee me.

1499
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:36,556
No thanks,
but we have to go.

1500
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:38,671
A little early for cocktails.

1501
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,029
Not even coffee?

1502
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:41,468
What?

1503
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:43,954
What is it?

1504
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:45,878
It's not a commercial.

1505
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:48,275
Come in a minute.

1506
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:10,111
Hello, zounds.
Philippe Abrams, bank manager.

1507
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:13,675
Pastis, like home.

1508
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:15,919
I'm not drinking.

1509
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:20,229
Cut!

1510
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:22,110
We can't.

1511
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,311
Just one. I'll close my eyes.

1512
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:54,751
Annabelle Deconink,
I'm at the rigis...

1513
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:57,755
Try it again.

1514
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:08,317
Hi, honey. Not too thin.

1515
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:10,868
Dad,

1516
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:13,158
I don't want to lose my toes.

1517
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:15,158
Why would you lose them?

1518
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:16,629
North Pole.

1519
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:19,513
It's not the North Pole.
It's the north.

1520
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:21,719
What an idiot.

1521
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:24,435
I'm at risk here.

1522
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:25,868
What risk?. I didn't get it.

1523
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:29,868
I've been busting my ass
in Salon for years.

1524
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:33,469
What?

1525
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,995
Long live the Shtimis!

1526
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,198
