1
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,780
January 1793.

2
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,181
The british fleet lies at
anchor at Spithead.

3
00:00:33,182 --> 00:00:35,782
Ships and men rot in idleness.
Across the channel,

4
00:00:35,783 --> 00:00:38,483
revolution in France is sweeping away
the old order.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,800
- Shore boat, ahoy!
- Aye, aye!

6
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,880
Jump!
You'll be all right!

7
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,200
Welcome to purgatory.

8
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,999
Mr. Eccleston, sir.

9
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,620
- Come aboard, sir.
- Your name?

10
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,950
H-h- Horatio Hornblower, sir.
Midshipman.

11
00:02:23,951 --> 00:02:26,090
Eccleston, first lieutenant.

12
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:28,400
Mr. Chadd, lieutenant of the watch.

13
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,020
Did you bring your dunnage
aboard with you?

14
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,020
My seachest is coming
aboard for'ard.

15
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,080
I'll see it's sent below,
where you should go too.

16
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,520
Get out of those wet clothes.

17
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:43,220
Yes, sir. I mean, aye, aye, sir.

18
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,950
Mr. Kennedy,take Mr.Hornblower down
to the midshipmen's birth.

19
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:50,800
Aye, aye, sir.

20
00:02:57,198 --> 00:02:59,720
Mind your step.

21
00:03:02,268 --> 00:03:04,921
Difficult to say
who smells the worst,

22
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:07,900
the men or the beasts in
the manger for'ard.

23
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:10,420
One gets used to it.

24
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:26,721
Watch your head.

25
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,820
There goes His Majesty's latest
bad bargain.

26
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,700
Belay that, Styles

27
00:03:32,701 --> 00:03:34,990
unless you want
to find yourself at the gratings.

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,320
Aye, aye, sir.

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,400
They're not bad men for
the most part,

30
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:42,300
provided they're kept busy.

31
00:03:42,301 --> 00:03:44,100
But this, endless waiting

32
00:03:44,101 --> 00:03:46,459
most of us have been here
six months already.

33
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,220
Discipline, you see?

34
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:50,820
Things will be different once
we transfer to a fighting vessel,

35
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:53,420
I don't doubt, but who knows
when that may be.

36
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,200
Our only hope is that the
unpleasantness in France

37
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:58,600
might come to something.

38
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,120
You've heard the latest rumours,
of course?

39
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,120
that Louis was captured just
before Christmas.

40
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,500
What do you think they'll do
with him? You can't kill a king.

41
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,700
It's as my father explained
to his gillie

42
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:17,199
Perhaps some of these people
have missed the odd meal or two

43
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,170
but lopping the heads of the nobility

44
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:21,400
isn't going to fill their bellies,
is it?

45
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:24,001
Still, that's Johnny Crapaud for you.

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,480
Well, allow me to introduce

47
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:31,080
the midshipmen of His Majesty's
ship of the line, Justinian

48
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:33,420
Known elsewise to her intimates
as the good ship

49
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:35,100
Slough of Despond.

50
00:04:35,101 --> 00:04:36,850
What's this, Archie?

51
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:38,920
Another mess mate, gentlemen.

52
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:41,250
And whose pretty rear did you neglect
kissing to find yourself

53
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:43,199
among the fleet's forgotten, eh?

54
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,689
- Well, speak, Apparition!
- My name is Hornblower.

55
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,100
What an infernal piece of
bad luck for you.

56
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:51,399
How old are you, Mr. Hornblower?

57
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Seventeen, sir.

58
00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:55,880
Seventeen, sir! You hear
that Cleveland?

59
00:04:55,881 --> 00:04:58,080
If you wanted to be a seaman, boy,

60
00:04:58,081 --> 00:05:00,100
you should have started at twelve.

61
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:02,200
I doubt he even knows the difference
between

62
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,180
a head and a halyard.

63
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,880
No, but I'll make sure it's the first
thing I look up in...

64
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:09,180
in Norrie's Seamanship.

65
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,120
Now, gentlemen, if you will
excuse me.

66
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,400
- Seasick!
- Seasick in Spithead!

67
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,980
Your pardon, sir.

68
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,200
There. Just lie quiet until you
feel yourself again.

69
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,480
The captain's coming aboard.

70
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,000
Captain Keene...

71
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,180
if ever a man was wrongly named.
He looks frailer by the day.

72
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,680
I must thank you for your
earlier kindness, Mr?

73
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,620
Clayton.

74
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:09,950
You mustn't mind Hether
and Cleveland.

75
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:12,490
It's just their way till they
get used to you.

76
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,680
Present arms!

77
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,520
Your father writes that
you are a solitary boy.

78
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,220
Well, on a vessel of over 800 souls,

79
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:43,580
you are unlikely to find either time
or place for solitude.

80
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,180
How is the good Doctor Hornblower?
Well, I trust?

81
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,525
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

82
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,700
He said to be sure to thank
you for accepting me

83
00:06:57,701 --> 00:07:00,100
in Justinian as midshipman, sir.

84
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,700
One good turn deserves another.

85
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:06,380
Your father is an excellent
physician.

86
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,720
Yes, sir.

87
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,480
The son of a doctor! Ha!

88
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,380
You'd have done better to choose
a lord for your father

89
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,180
if you wanted to make a career
in His Majesty's navy.

90
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,380
How far did your education go?

91
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,380
I was a Grecian at school, sir.

92
00:07:32,395 --> 00:07:36,280
- Speak up.
- I was a Grecian, sir, at school.

93
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,480
You construed Xenofot, then,
as well as Cicero.

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,680
Yes, sir. But, not very well, sir.

95
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,850
You'd have done better if you knew
something

96
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:50,099
about sines and cosines.

97
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,680
Better still if you could foresee
a squall

98
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,181
in time to get t'gallants in.

99
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,380
We have no time for ablative
absolutes in the navy.

100
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
- No, sir.
- Obey orders, do your duty,

101
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:09,400
and no harm will come to you.

102
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,680
That will do.

103
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,180
Ah, the Indies, now that's
the place, Horatio

104
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,480
Clear blue skies, and waters too.

105
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,690
I should very much like to see
that, Mr. Hether.

106
00:08:33,691 --> 00:08:35,500
So you may,

107
00:08:35,501 --> 00:08:39,400
if we ever get off this stinking
hulk and put to sea again.

108
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,780
You're in my seat.

109
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,500
The head of the table is my place.

110
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,901
Come on, up!

111
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,080
How now, my sweet brother officers?

112
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:06,000
No cheer for Jack's return?

113
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:08,249
We took you for a lieutenant
by now, Jack.

114
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,680
- Did you?
- Your commission?

115
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,680
- Refused.
- Oh, bad luck.

116
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,920
Bad luck indeed.

117
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,600
So, acting lieutenant Simpson is
once again

118
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,680
Mr. Midshipman Simpson.

119
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,280
At your service.

120
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,220
What's this? A new face among
our august company. Mr??

121
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,220
Hornblower, sir.
Pleased to meet you.

122
00:09:35,221 --> 00:09:37,220
What have you there?

123
00:09:37,221 --> 00:09:39,200
Mutton, sir.

124
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,500
Very fine. Very fine indeed.
A mite salty for my taste.

125
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,500
What do you mean by helping
yourself to my vittles, sir?

126
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,300
I should have thought my intention
was quite obvious.

127
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,990
Kennedy

128
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,180
You'll acquaint young Snotty here
with the way of things

129
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,020
or have you forgotten so soon?

130
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,900
N-n- no. I,

131
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,980
Mr.Simpson may levy a toll upon
our seachests for fresh shirts.

132
00:10:20,981 --> 00:10:23,000
Likewise, our issue of spirits,
and the best cuts

133
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:24,795
of meat go to him.

134
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,780
- Why?
- He is senior officer in the mess.

135
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,880
We are all midshipmen.

136
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,880
That smacks of republicanism
to my mind, Mr. Hornblower.

137
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,000
Is that what you are?

138
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:39,880
To my knowledge there is nothing
in King's Regulations?

139
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,880
I pee on your regulations!

140
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,400
There is but one law in this mess
render unto Caesar

141
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,300
And I'll leave it to you to figure
which of us is Caesar

142
00:10:52,301 --> 00:10:55,280
and which is to do the rendering.

143
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,480
He takes your meaning, Jack.

144
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:05,080
Oh Clayton, you gin-soaked sot.

145
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Strangle a tune from that
fiddle of yours.

146
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,400
Hornblower...

147
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Cut a reel.

148
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,400
Didn't you hear me, sir?
Dance, I said.

149
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,000
Dance! Dance! Dance!

150
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,680
I've seen men caper more lively on
the end of a gibbet.

151
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,400
Mr. Kennedy,

152
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,400
that Mr. Hornblower might learn
who runs this mess,

153
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:50,300
you'll wake him every half-hour
day and night

154
00:11:50,301 --> 00:11:52,700
until I tell you otherwise.

155
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Kennedy! Archie!

156
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,680
Kennedy! I said wake Hornblower,
not me and the whole darn ship

157
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,920
- He's sick.
- I don't care if he's dying. Keep him quiet.

158
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,200
Archie!

159
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,080
He's started again. I feared as much.

160
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,600
Clayton! If he's unfit,
you'll take his duties

161
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:36,999
in respect to waking Hornblower.

162
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,700
- Do you hear?
- As you please, Jack. As you please.

163
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,680
Help me get him back to his bed.

164
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,080
It's all right, Archie,

165
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,280
it's all right. A bad dream.
Sleep now, sleep.

166
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,620
What ails him?

167
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,100
What ails us all?

168
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,280
Sir! Mr. Hornblower!

169
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,280
Mr. Eccleston asks if you can attend
him in the fighting top.

170
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,920
- The fighting top?
- Aye, sir. At once, he said.

171
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,120
Not afraid of heights,
are you, Snotty?

172
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,780
Mind you, mighty long drop.

173
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,900
Help me! Please.

174
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,020
Help me,...please.

175
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,500
Time, gentlemen!

176
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,500
Let's see how you have fared
with the problem

177
00:15:49,501 --> 00:15:51,899
set for you by Mr. Bowles.

178
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,400
Mr. Simpson?e must all rejoice,

179
00:15:54,401 --> 00:15:57,200
the sources of the Nile have been
discovered at last.

180
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,880
Your ship, as far as I can make out
from your illiterate scrawl

181
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,680
is in central Africa.

182
00:16:04,695 --> 00:16:07,580
see what other terrae incogitiae
have been opened up

183
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,580
by the remaining intrepid explorers.

184
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,100
Mr Cleveland, No.

185
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,900
Mr. Hether, No.

186
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,980
Mr. Kennedy, No.

187
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,820
Mr. Hornblower.

188
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,580
You must be proud to be
alone successful

189
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,580
among this crowd of
intellectual giants.

190
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,580
If you double your attainment while
you double your years,

191
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,680
I'm a-feared you'll leave
the rest of us behind.

192
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,580
Well done, Mr. Hornblower.

193
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,580
Mr. Bowles! Be so good
to see that Mr. Simpson

194
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,580
pays even further attention to
his mathematical studies.

195
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,500
Good day, gentlemen!

196
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,699
I've been thinking, gentlemen.

197
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:25,300
It's time to reconvene the
proceedings of the Inquisition.

198
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,620
Who shall we question? There can
only be one candidate

199
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,620
who else but the captain's favourite

200
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,890
Mr. Hornblower. Cleveland,
Hether table.

201
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,900
- Jack...
- Do it unless you want to take his place.

202
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:43,601
Leave me go!

203
00:17:43,602 --> 00:17:45,672
Quiet boy!

204
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,620
You're a bit of a dark horse,
aren't you, Snotty?

205
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,500
Showing us all up in front
of Captain Keene. Turn him over.

206
00:17:53,801 --> 00:17:55,901
Come on!

207
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,700
Now, the purpose of this Inquisition
is for me

208
00:18:01,701 --> 00:18:03,899
to get to know you better.

209
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,099
You see, I know these dogs.

210
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,550
I know what gnaws at their
souls at night

211
00:18:09,551 --> 00:18:12,050
things they'd rather no one knew of.

212
00:18:12,651 --> 00:18:16,620
So, what's your dirty little secret?

213
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,100
A fancier of other boys, perhaps?

214
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,820
Or is it that your mother makes
her living on her back?

215
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,680
You filthy!

216
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,820
Come on, Snotty! Get up!

217
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,820
You've won, Jack! He's finished!

218
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,920
This little whore's son needs to
learn respect for his betters.

219
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:51,820
Come on, Snotty, get up!

220
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,820
Enough Jack, you'll kill him!

221
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,080
Stay down, boy, for goodness sake.

222
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,500
Stand off.

223
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,820
Clayton, my bold friend.
I've no quarrel with you.

224
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,700
Stand off Jack,

225
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,820
or by cracky I'll trim the
wall with your brains.

226
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,180
Take him to Dr. Hepplewhite.

227
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,180
My, but how bold you are
with a pistol in your hand.

228
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,900
But I know you for the coward
you are, don't I?

229
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,120
Hornblower! Mr. Hornblower!

230
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,120
What is the matter with you this day?

231
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:24,150
I gave orders?
Man, what happened to you?

232
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,500
I missed my footing in the dark
last night and fell, sir.

233
00:20:27,501 --> 00:20:30,120
Onto both sides of your face
at once? Hmm?

234
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,320
Come, no more of this nonsense.
With whom did you fight?

235
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,120
Well, answer me!

236
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,800
Quickly now and you may be dealt
with more leniently.

237
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:41,400
I fell, sir.

238
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,100
Very well. We shall see if a
spell in the rigging

239
00:20:45,101 --> 00:20:48,200
can't teach you to tread
more carefully.

240
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,900
<i>Dearest Father,</i>

241
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,700
<i>I am pleased to tell you that
everything is going along</i>

242
00:20:58,701 --> 00:21:00,199
<i>splendidly.</i>

243
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,120
<i>I count myself fortunate indeed to
serve under Captain Keene</i>

244
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,700
<i>and with so fine a body of men as</i>

245
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:09,190
<i>are to be found here in Justinian.</i>

246
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,100
<i>I am very happy here.</i>

247
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:18,020
<i>I trust this finds you as it leave me
well and in good spirits.</i>

248
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,800
<i>Your affectionate son, Horatio.</i>

249
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,100
A drop of grog in it to
warm you through.

250
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,680
Horatio?

251
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,600
Death.

252
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,900
I was thinking on death.

253
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,300
- Whose?
- Mine.

254
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Darned unsporting of the Everlasting
to fix his canon

255
00:22:08,001 --> 00:22:10,301
against self-slaughter,

256
00:22:10,302 --> 00:22:12,602
If you ask me.

257
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,980
You could always desert.

258
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,500
I'd never be free of him then.

259
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,200
He'd have won,

260
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,400
and that should be worse than death.

261
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,820
Someone should stand against him.

262
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,700
The beating he gave you
that was nothing, believe me.

263
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,920
You don't know half what
he's capable of.

264
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,720
The East India convoy is
expected today.

265
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,480
Mr. Simpson will take a party
of men ashore

266
00:22:54,481 --> 00:22:56,650
and report to Lt. Chalk
of the Goliath, who is in charge

267
00:22:56,651 --> 00:22:58,290
of the press gangs.

268
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,320
- Mr. Hornblower shall accompany him.
- Aye, aye, sir.

269
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,700
Some of the hands of the East India
convoy

270
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:05,560
may try to sneak ashore

271
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:07,580
to escape being pressed
for further service.

272
00:23:07,581 --> 00:23:09,525
It's our business to cut off
their retreat.

273
00:23:09,526 --> 00:23:13,320
- Mr. Simpson and?
- This is Mr. Hornblower, sir,

274
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,520
distinguished as the midshipman who
was seasick in Spithead.

275
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,800
You shall arrange a cordon along
the waterfront

276
00:23:19,801 --> 00:23:21,625
to sweep up any absconders.

277
00:23:21,626 --> 00:23:23,600
I leave the details to
you, Mr.Simpson.

278
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:25,579
Aye, aye, sir. Thank you, sir.

279
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,400
Rendezvous is back here
at "The Lamb."

280
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,520
Why aren't you on watch
where I left you?

281
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,520
The convoy has not yet signaled.

282
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,520
Then all is well with the world.

283
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,320
Here's to the East India convoy
long may it be delayed.

284
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,520
Come on Hornblower, give us a toast.

285
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,080
Come on!

286
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,800
Confusion to Robespierre.

287
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,450
Your men are all properly placed,
Mr. Simpson?

288
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:33,645
Indeed they are, sir.

289
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,580
This is Mr. Caldwell,
also of the Goliath.

290
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,520
Mr. Simpson and Mr. Hornblower
of the Justinian.

291
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,520
We have a long wait
before us, I fear.

292
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,550
Will you gentlemen join me in a glass?
- Yes, sir.

293
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,000
- And a game of cards to pass the time.
- Gladly, sir, gladly.

294
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,720
Excellent. Potman! Cards and a light!

295
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,120
And the rest are mine.

296
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,420
What do you mean the rest are yours?

297
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:15,600
- Five tricks. Game and rubber.
- I might take another.

298
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:17,850
I trump a lead of hearts
with diamonds

299
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,699
and make three more clubs.

300
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,190
- You're very sure.
- It's a mathematical certainty.

301
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,320
You know too much about this game.

302
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,320
He seems to know the backs of
the cards as well as the fronts.

303
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,200
That is an insulting remark,
Mr. Simpson.

304
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,080
For that I shall have
to ask satisfaction.

305
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,420
Come,Mr. Hornblower. Mr.Simpson had
a momentary loss of temper.

306
00:25:45,421 --> 00:25:47,300
I am sure he will explain.

307
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:49,350
I have been accused of cheating
at cards, sir.

308
00:25:49,351 --> 00:25:51,500
That is a hard thing to explain away.

309
00:25:51,501 --> 00:25:53,650
The wine was in and the wit was out.

310
00:25:53,651 --> 00:25:55,899
Mr. Simpson was speaking in jest,
I am sure.

311
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,120
Let's call for another bottle and
drink it in friendship.

312
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,520
- With pleasure?
- Excellent.

313
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:10,150
if Mr.Simpson begs my pardon at once
before you two gentlemen,

314
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,600
and admits that he spoke without
justification and in a manner

315
00:26:13,601 --> 00:26:15,920
no gentleman would employ.

316
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,120
Apologize to you?

317
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,220
Never this side of hell.

318
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,680
You hear that, gentlemen?

319
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,020
I have been insulted.
Mr. Simpson refuses to apologize,

320
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,800
while insulting me further.

321
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,520
There is only one way now in which
satisfaction can be given.

322
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,299
A duel? Are you mad?

323
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,570
Tomorrow sees an end to it, Archie.

324
00:26:42,571 --> 00:26:44,920
One way or another, I shall
be rid of him.

325
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,480
I have an even chance.

326
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,700
An even chance?

327
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:54,020
Simpson is reckoned one of the best
shots in the navy.

328
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,000
He'll kill you certain sure.

329
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,500
I'll act as your second, of course.

330
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,300
But, have you ever fought
a duel before?

331
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,000
You ready?

332
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,100
I can't prevail upon you to
change your mind?

333
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,900
Very well. Hand me my cloak.

334
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,900
Where is he?

335
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,210
I regret my principal has met
with an accident,

336
00:28:44,211 --> 00:28:46,499
which prevents his attendance
this morning.

337
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,800
The coward has wet himself.

338
00:28:48,801 --> 00:28:52,320
As his second, I am willing
to stand proxy.

339
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:56,520
- Proxy?
- I shall fight the duel in his stead

340
00:28:56,521 --> 00:28:59,180
unless Mr. Simpson is willing to
withdraw his accusation,

341
00:28:59,181 --> 00:29:00,899
of course.

342
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,820
- Never.
- Wait a moment Mr. Clayton,

343
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:06,049
I'm not sure if that's legal.

344
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:08,300
Legal or not, Dr.Hepplewhite,
it would settle the matter,

345
00:29:08,301 --> 00:29:10,129
I am here.

346
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,820
And you're not afraid of me,

347
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,700
are you, Jack?

348
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,100
I will say, "One, two, three, fire."

349
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,320
At the last word gentlemen, you
can fire as you will.

350
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,900
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

351
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,600
Yes.

352
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,520
One, two, three,

353
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,900
Fire!

354
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,080
Got you, bastard.

355
00:30:40,781 --> 00:30:43,281
Upstairs.

356
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,082
Clayton?

357
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:07,900
I'm sorry. I didn't kill him.

358
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,720
What is it?
What are they shouting about?

359
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,380
I don't know.

360
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,320
Archie, see if you can't quiet them.

361
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,280
Why?

362
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,780
You were right, Horatio.

363
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,500
Someone had to stand against him,

364
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,500
but not a boy.

365
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:04,300
You shamed me.
Even a coward can't run forever.

366
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,700
I thought I could beat him

367
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,100
I had an even chance.

368
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,500
Horatio, is it evening?

369
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,999
Hornblower!

370
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:11,000
I'm not done with you yet, boy.
I? going to flay you alive!

371
00:33:27,499 --> 00:33:29,999
- He's dead.
- Yes.

372
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,720
No, you fool, not Clayton.

373
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:35,200
Louis.
The frogs have murdered their king.

374
00:33:35,201 --> 00:33:37,699
Tried and executed for crimes
against the people.

375
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,599
It means war, Horatio.

376
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,200
Don't you understand?
It means war.

377
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,900
- Well, what's the word?
- Do we transfer?

378
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,450
A third of the crew are to remain
with Justinian.

379
00:34:01,451 --> 00:34:03,820
A third will go to Arethusa

380
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,800
under Black Charlie Hammond.
And we few,

381
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:14,420
- we fortunate few?
- Don't keep us on tenterhooks!

382
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,420
Keene has recommended our
transfer to?Indefatigable!

383
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,420
- Yes, a frigate!
- You hear that, Horatio?

384
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,800
It means prize money.

385
00:34:23,801 --> 00:34:26,180
Horatio!

386
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:31,700
Poor old Clayton, he always
wanted to serve on a frigate.

387
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,690
It is a sure opportunity
for advancement,

388
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:38,199
for distinction, for prize money.

389
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,700
It is the opportunity of a lifetime,
sir.I thank you for it,but

390
00:34:40,701 --> 00:34:43,200
Any ambitious young officer
would jump at the chance to serve

391
00:34:43,201 --> 00:34:45,099
on a frigate!

392
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,120
I know, sir. But, you accepted me
here as midshipman and

393
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,700
of course, I must stay with you.

394
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,820
Not many young men would have
said that, Mr. Hornblower.

395
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,520
I am very touched by your loyalty,

396
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,820
even though I won't live to
appreciate it.

397
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,820
No, please, don't interrupt.

398
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,820
Youth and quick wits

399
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:15,399
belong where they can be rewarded,

400
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,300
not on a channel groper with
a dying captain.

401
00:35:19,301 --> 00:35:21,101
Sir?

402
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,420
A midshipman's share of prize
money is not much,

403
00:35:25,421 --> 00:35:27,800
I grant you, but at last you
can start to repay

404
00:35:27,801 --> 00:35:30,099
the debt that you owe your father.

405
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:34,380
It is the good of the service I have
in mind, Mr. Hornblower,

406
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,820
when I insist that you take
up this posting.

407
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,900
Aye, aye, sir.

408
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,000
My name is Captain Sir Edward Pellew,

409
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,000
and I am here to tell you that your
days of idling are over!

410
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,800
You have in mind to fight?

411
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,620
That is well, for you shall
have your fill!

412
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,200
Yesterday, His Majesty received
a communication from Paris.

413
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,420
The Revolutionary Government
in France

414
00:36:40,421 --> 00:36:42,799
has declared war on Britain.

415
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,120
The old adversary may wear
a new face, but whatever mask

416
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:50,720
he choosesto hide behind, a Frenchman
is still a Frenchman, and

417
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,800
we will beat him as we always
have beaten him!

418
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,700
For there is no power on earth
that can withstand

419
00:36:58,701 --> 00:37:01,400
the might of the British Navy!

420
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,400
God Save The King!

421
00:37:09,601 --> 00:37:11,601
God Save The King!

422
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,150
Midshipman Hornblower, sir.
You sent for me.

423
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,850
Mr. Simpson, as I am sure
you will be glad to hear,

424
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,200
shall recover and rejoin the service.

425
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,120
However, he is to remain with
Captain Keene aboard Justinian.

426
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,820
You should know, Mr. Hornblower,

427
00:37:40,821 --> 00:37:43,320
that I do not think much of men who

428
00:37:43,321 --> 00:37:45,699
let other's fight their battles
for them.

429
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,620
No, sir.

430
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:50,780
But, neither will I base my opinion
of an officer on hearsay.

431
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:53,720
I judge a man on what I see him do,
not what

432
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,620
- others tell me he has done.
- Yes, sir.

433
00:37:56,621 --> 00:37:58,899
Doubtless, had you been properly led,

434
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,899
this situation would not have arisen.

435
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,220
Captain Keene bears no blame?

436
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,220
It's not your place to condemn
him or defend him.

437
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,850
No, sir, I meant only that what
befell was outside his control.

438
00:38:08,851 --> 00:38:10,605
Aboard his ship, sir,

439
00:38:10,606 --> 00:38:12,943
there is nothing outside
a captain's control

440
00:38:12,944 --> 00:38:15,280
- and you would do well to remember it
- Yes, sir.

441
00:38:15,281 --> 00:38:17,100
England is at war, Mr. Hornblower.

442
00:38:17,101 --> 00:38:19,220
You have already cost this navy
two midshipmen

443
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,150
one injured, one dead.

444
00:38:21,151 --> 00:38:23,399
No one mourns Mr.Clayton's loss more
than I, sir,and I resent?

445
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,220
You resent?

446
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,520
Darn your impudence, sir.

447
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,450
I will not lose men to no better
cause than

448
00:38:31,451 --> 00:38:34,100
the satisfaction of their own vanity.

449
00:38:34,101 --> 00:38:36,255
Whilst under my command,
you will issue

450
00:38:36,256 --> 00:38:38,429
no further challenge,
is that understood?

451
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:41,720
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Very well.

452
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,720
I have it from Lt. Eccleston that
those hands formerly

453
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:48,600
of Mr.Simpson's division
are something

454
00:38:48,601 --> 00:38:50,399
of an ill-disciplined rabble.

455
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,820
- Would you concur?
- Yes, sir.

456
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:55,079
They are now your division.

457
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,920
We sail to battle, Mr. Hornblower.
I cannot afford to feed men

458
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,920
who do not pull their weight.
You will make them work

459
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,920
- or you will answer for it.
- Yes, sir.

460
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,320
Division line up for inspection.

461
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,400
Name?

462
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,620
What's the matter with
your face, Styles?

463
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,180
Oh, he gets bi...

464
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,920
Boils, sir, awful bad.

465
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,100
- Have you done anything about them?
- Oh yes, sir.

466
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,100
- Well?
- I've put plasters on them, sir.

467
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,920
Very well. What's funny, Oldroyd?

468
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,420
- Nothing, sir.
- Matthews?

469
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,780
Nothing, sir.

470
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,920
All right, carry on.
Be about your work, now.

471
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,480
Aye, aye, sir.

472
00:40:46,481 --> 00:40:48,900
Break his back. Break his back.

473
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,680
Time! Time, Styles!

474
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,920
Five dead, pay your bets,
evens or better.

475
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:58,990
- Six!
- Five!

476
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,620
- Where?
- There, that one's dead.

477
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,920
- No, he ain't. Come on?
- Look, yes he is, his back is broken.

478
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,520
Oh, fuck!

479
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,620
Who's in charge, here?

480
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:26,420
- We're not on watch, sir.
- No, you're gambling.

481
00:41:26,421 --> 00:41:28,750
This is now't but a bit of fun, sir.

482
00:41:28,751 --> 00:41:30,990
It's hardly what you could
call gambling.

483
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,820
There are other charges possible
here, Matthews.

484
00:41:33,821 --> 00:41:35,800
Other charges?

485
00:41:35,801 --> 00:41:38,520
A member of His Majesty's forces
can be charged

486
00:41:38,521 --> 00:41:41,221
with rendering himself unfit
for service.

487
00:41:41,222 --> 00:41:43,800
Similarly, there could be charges
of aiding and abetting,

488
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,840
which might include you.

489
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,999
I should consult the Articles of War.

490
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,100
Punishment for such an offense is

491
00:41:50,101 --> 00:41:52,910
- flogging around the fleet,I believe.
- Really, sir.

492
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:55,720
I could bring charges against
every man jack of you.

493
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,920
You could be court martialed,
dis-rated, flogged.

494
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,850
By God,one more look like that
from you, Styles,and I'll do it.

495
00:42:02,851 --> 00:42:04,700
Belay that, mate.

496
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:07,000
You'd be in irons five minutes after

497
00:42:07,001 --> 00:42:09,200
I've spoken to Lt.Eccleston.

498
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,920
Mr. Simpson had no argument
with our sports.

499
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,920
Mr. Simpson is no longer in charge
of your division.

500
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,320
I am.

501
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,620
And I'll have no more of these
filthy games,do you understand?

502
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:25,620
The next hint of misbehaviour and
you will be at the gratings.

503
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:30,020
- But, sir?
- I've said it and I mean it!

504
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,600
After this, I want to see you in
the dogwatches,

505
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:41,920
sky-larking on deck,

506
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,520
not skulking in the cable tiers like
a lot of darn Frenchmen.

507
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,680
Are you going to tell Mr. Eccleston?

508
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,080
No, not this time.

509
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,620
I'm giving you a chance to prove
yourselves worthy of my trust.

510
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,520
Aye, sir.

511
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,520
Right, now. Get rid of
those rats there.

512
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,120
Styles, get your face
plastered up again.

513
00:43:13,121 --> 00:43:15,720
Matthews, coil these cables
down properly

514
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:18,101
before the boatswain sees it.

515
00:43:18,102 --> 00:43:20,400
Oldroyd, it was six.

516
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,800
Hands to quarters! Hands to quarters!
Enemy ship to larboard!

517
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,800
- Fire as they bear, Mr. Eccleston.
- Aye, sir.

518
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,100
Fire!

519
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,900
Lay us alongside, Mr. Bowles.

520
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,900
We can carry this action
by boarding her.

521
00:44:25,901 --> 00:44:29,000
Hard a larboard!

522
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,320
Styles,help me get him
to the surgery!

523
00:44:45,421 --> 00:44:47,421
Come on, Davey.

524
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,920
- This man needs help.
- I'll tend to him presently.

525
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,920
Lt. Chadd, may I inquire as to
the extent of your injuries,sir?

526
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:09,820
- Splinter.
- Sir, this man is from my division?

527
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:11,800
He'll take his turn like
all the rest.

528
00:45:11,801 --> 00:45:13,880
Well darn it, if he's not seen to now
he'll bleed to death!

529
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:17,820
Mr. Hornblower! It's all right,
Hepplewhite, I can wait.

530
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,100
Very well.

531
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:24,480
Come on Styles, let's return
to our station.

532
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,920
Did you see me? Did you see me?
Well, where were you?

533
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,820
We carried her by boarding.
I killed two.

534
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,200
Well, one certainly. Oh, you should
have been there, Horatio.

535
00:45:52,201 --> 00:45:54,501
You should have been.

536
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,100
Through our Lord Jesus Christ,
who at his coming

537
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:00,990
shall change our vile body

538
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,920
that it may be like his
glorious body,

539
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:05,900
according to the mighty working
whereby he is able to submit

540
00:46:05,901 --> 00:46:07,490
all things to himself.

541
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,600
Therefore,in the sure and certain
knowledge of the resurrection

542
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,920
- we commit the body of?
- Davey Williams.

543
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,200
?avey Williams to the deep,
amen.

544
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:28,701
May God have mercy on his soul.

545
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Mr. Hornblower.

546
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,800
What is it, Styles?

547
00:46:37,801 --> 00:46:39,701
The lads have...

548
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,450
asked me to say they value the effort
you made

549
00:46:43,451 --> 00:46:45,290
on Davey's part, sir.

550
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,680
That was all.

551
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,400
Styles!

552
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,300
Please convey my thanks to the men.

553
00:46:55,301 --> 00:46:58,720
Their conduct in this afternoon's
action was exemplary.

554
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,180
Aye, aye, sir.

555
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,400
A salute.

556
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,401
Well, it's a start,
I suppose.

557
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,080
Bay of Biscay

558
00:47:16,081 --> 00:47:18,381
"Indefatigable" attacks
a French food convoy.

559
00:47:26,382 --> 00:47:28,582
Quel bateau?

560
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:31,383
Claudette, de Marseilles.

561
00:47:31,384 --> 00:47:33,984
Qu'est-ce-que vous emportez?

562
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:36,385
Molasse
Trois cent tons.

563
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,920
- Claudette of Marseilles, sir.
- Cargo?

564
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:42,280
- Molasses, 300 tons.
- Lt. Chadd!

565
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,320
- Sir.
- Take 6 men,board that vessel,take her

566
00:47:44,321 --> 00:47:46,920
into any English port you can
make and report there for orders.

567
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,920
Aye, aye, sir.

568
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,900
Mr. Bowles, the schooner
to starboard, if you please.

569
00:47:51,901 --> 00:47:54,301
Aye, sir.
Brace hard to larboard!

570
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,520
She's still running under
colours, sir.

571
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,320
It's not my intention to chase him
across the Seven Seas.

572
00:48:07,321 --> 00:48:10,200
He's asked for it, Mr. Eccleston.
Let him have it.

573
00:48:10,201 --> 00:48:12,601
Starboard bow chaser, fire!

574
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,500
Silence!

575
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,480
Not into the hull, darn it.
Cripple her!

576
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,920
That's better. More like it.

577
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,480
She's hauling down her colours,sir.

578
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,000
Well Mr. Eccleston?

579
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,200
Marie Galante of Bordeaux, sir.

580
00:48:37,201 --> 00:48:39,701
Twenty-four days out of New Orleans
with rice.

581
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,770
About 200 tons, I should say.

582
00:48:41,771 --> 00:48:43,900
She'll sell for a pretty penny when
we get her home.

583
00:48:43,901 --> 00:48:45,995
- How many of her crew?
- Twelve at most.

584
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,920
A prize crew of four then, I should
say. Midshipman's command

585
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,520
- Mr. Hornblower!
- Sir!

586
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,920
Take 4 men, board her. Mr. Bowles
will give you our position.

587
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,250
Take her into any English
port you can

588
00:48:57,251 --> 00:48:59,920
- make and report there for orders.
- Aye, aye, sir.

589
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,920
Your first command.
My congratulations.

590
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,920
Today, if you please, Mr. Hornblower.

591
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I don't intend to lose any more
of this convoy

592
00:49:08,001 --> 00:49:09,980
through your dawdling, sir!

593
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,100
Aye, aye, sir.

594
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,700
They've made best use of
their time, sir.

595
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,620
- Drunk as lords.
- Wish we were as happy, eh?

596
00:49:53,621 --> 00:49:56,700
Where is your officer?

597
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,920
Midshipman Hornblower,

598
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,920
of His Britannic Majesty's frigate,
Indefatigable. Good-day.

599
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,920
This vessel is now a prize of war,
Captain, under my command.

600
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
A midshipman?
You have no officer more senior?

601
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,100
Sir, to the British Navy, a schooner
such as

602
00:50:13,101 --> 00:50:15,480
this warrants no more than
a midshipman's command.

603
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,980
But you are no more than a boy!

604
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,500
You will find, sir, that even a boy
in His Majesty's Navy

605
00:50:20,501 --> 00:50:23,520
is capable of an easy two-day
run to England.

606
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,920
Put that down, Styles.
At once, do you hear?

607
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,920
And take these men for'ard.
Throw them into the fos'cle.

608
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,600
Come along, you Frenchie.
This way. Come on.

609
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,920
- Right, move!
- I am an officer. I do not go with the men.

610
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,500
- Sir?
- He goes with the rest.

611
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:47,001
You, come on!

612
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,000
The prisoners are secure, sir.

613
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,720
Matthews, you've the longest service,
I believe.

614
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,920
- Aye sir, 18 years.
- Very well. I'll rate you petty officer.

615
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,400
Aye, aye, sir.
Thank- you, sir.

616
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Get to work and clear that raffle
away for-ard

617
00:51:23,001 --> 00:51:24,980
so we can sling the topsail yard in.

618
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,999
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Haul in the fos'cle sheets.

619
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,920
- Aye, aye, sir. Styles, Oldroyd.
- All right, all right!

620
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,920
I'll be busy aft.

621
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,520
And get that staysail in before
it flogs itself to pieces.

622
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,120
Well, what are you waiting for?
Those were my orders.

623
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:48,400
Beg 'pardon sir, but if we're to
sling that yard again,

624
00:51:48,401 --> 00:51:50,375
- we'll need to use the jeers, Sir.
- Yes?

625
00:51:50,376 --> 00:51:52,350
Well sir, we'll need more hands than
we have

626
00:51:52,351 --> 00:51:53,990
to use the jeers, sir.

627
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,920
Can I put some of those
Frenchies to work?

628
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,020
That was my intention, of course
if any of them

629
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,200
- are sober enough.
- I think we can get them to work,sir.

630
00:52:02,201 --> 00:52:04,101
drunk or sober.

631
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:24,680
Oh boy, what do I do now?

632
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,300
Dammed.

633
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,780
- Matthews!
- Aye, aye, sir.

634
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:54,120
We'll square away.Then return the
prisoners to the foc'scle.

635
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,480
Aye, aye, sir.
Square away!

636
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:01,720
Return the prisoners to the foc'scle.

637
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,400
- Matthews, take the wheel.
- Aye, aye, sir.

638
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,920
- What course, sir?
- Norwest by west a quarter west.

639
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,680
Norwest by west a quarter
west, it is sir.

640
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,520
Not into the hull, darn it!
Cripple her!

641
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,320
By God! She's holed!

642
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
She's holed all right.

643
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:26,520
About 2 feet below the waterline.
Thank-you, Styles.

644
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,480
She was close hauled and heeling
right over when we hit her.

645
00:54:29,481 --> 00:54:31,500
Her bows must have lifted just
as the Indy fired.

646
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:33,920
And of course, she's lower in
the water now, sir.

647
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,100
At least, on this tack, the hole
is not so deep under, sir.

648
00:54:36,101 --> 00:54:38,320
On this tack, we're headed
for France.

649
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,700
We must further a sail and get it
over that hole.

650
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,000
Use an old t'gallant.
Get the Frenchmen to help.

651
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,920
She is riding a bit heavily, now.

652
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,920
She's taking a little water, yes.

653
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,920
A foul wind for England, monsieur.

654
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,920
- Winds may change, monsieur.
- So they say.

655
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,920
Sir, she's riding a bit heavily now.

656
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,420
- Yes, thank-you, Matthews.
- I just said so to your captain.

657
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,880
Well, so much then for your easy
2-days run to England.

658
00:55:08,881 --> 00:55:11,820
- Sir!
- What is it?

659
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,020
The deck seam is opening up!

660
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,920
- I've never seen anything like it,sir.
- It's the rice.

661
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,920
The cargo, Matthews.
We're carrying rice.

662
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,720
The water has got into
it and it's swelling.

663
00:55:28,722 --> 00:55:30,700
The sooner we get a sail over
that hole the better.

664
00:55:30,701 --> 00:55:32,920
Hurry these darn Frenchmen up!

665
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,920
Come on mesdemoiselles.
We're not sewing petticoats!

666
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,920
I told you I thought
she was riding heavily.

667
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,080
Go to the devil.

668
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Another few feet.

669
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,600
There!

670
00:56:26,101 --> 00:56:28,401
All right, sir.

671
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,920
Right, lay her back on the
larboard tack.

672
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,700
This is folly, monsieur.

673
00:56:36,701 --> 00:56:38,550
On this tack, we could easily
make Bordeaux.

674
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:40,920
You're risking all our lives.

675
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:43,600
Look! The rats!

676
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,720
I don't think our problem
is the hole, sir.

677
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,920
The rice must have forced her seams
open under the water.

678
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,400
We must jettison the cargo.

679
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,000
Get the sails in and rig a tackle
from that yard.

680
00:57:17,001 --> 00:57:19,780
We'll sway it up.

681
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,320
Madness, this is madness.

682
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,920
We must have moved about 50 tons.
My men are exhausted.

683
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,920
She's lower in the water, sir.
Settling fast.

684
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,720
Another hour we'll be swimming.
It's no go, sir. Sorry.

685
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,720
I shall make preparations for
abandoning the ship.

686
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:16,920
- Sir?
- You heard me.

687
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,200
Get water and bread into the
ship's boat

688
00:58:19,201 --> 00:58:21,920
and get everyone aboard.

689
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,200
- We shall abandon the ship, Monsieur.
- Enfin!

690
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,820
- Ready to shove off, sir.
- Very good. I'll be up presently.

691
00:58:46,821 --> 00:58:48,521
Beggin' your pardon, sir,

692
00:58:48,522 --> 00:58:50,920
but you should see as you have
some warm clothes, sir.

693
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,930
I've been in an open boat
10 days once, sir.

694
00:58:52,931 --> 00:58:55,820
- It can get darn cold.
- Yes, thank-you, Matthews.

695
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,920
- Is everyone off?
- All save yourself, sir.

696
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,920
Come aboard sir, she's done for.

697
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:36,320
Matthews, take the tiller.

698
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,280
Get off!

699
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,600
Bear off!

700
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,800
She is going down, sir.

701
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,600
- Breakfast, sir.
- Thank-you, Matthews.

702
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,920
The wind's backing a
little westerly today, sir.

703
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,480
That's so.

704
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,720
There's a chance we might find
the Indefatigable again.

705
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:12,100
This is her hunting ground, afterall.

706
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,400
- We'll make sail.
- Very good, sir.

707
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,620
Finch, take the sheet.

708
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,020
Styles, take the tiller.

709
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:44,020
Keep her close hauled on
the larboard tack.

710
01:01:44,021 --> 01:01:46,321
Close haul on the larboard tack, sir.

711
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:51,420
The wind is still fair for Bordeaux.

712
01:01:51,421 --> 01:01:53,820
We could be there by tomorrow.

713
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:56,920
- Why do we sail northwest?
- We go to England.

714
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:58,930
But,this is going to take us a week,

715
01:01:58,931 --> 01:02:00,920
even if the wind is still fair.

716
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,920
The boat is too crowded.
Should there be a storm,

717
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,920
you are risking all our lives.
I insist

718
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,920
that you head towards Bordeaux.

719
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Matthews, take this.

720
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,980
Beggin your pardon,sir,but hadn't
you better cock your pistol?

721
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:27,920
Monsieur, I was in a stinking
English prison for 5 years,

722
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,720
so let's make an agreement.
Let's go to France.

723
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:33,000
No.

724
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:36,720
When we reach shore, anywhere
you choose, we will land,

725
01:02:36,721 --> 01:02:39,120
- and you may continue your journey.
- No!

726
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:41,820
- I said no!
- Shall I clout him on the jaw for you, sir?

727
01:02:41,821 --> 01:02:44,420
Not unless he misbehaves himself.

728
01:02:44,425 --> 01:02:47,020
Put that pistol away,
it's dangerous.

729
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:51,021
I will do nothing to interfere with
your command of this boat.

730
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,200
Do you swear it?

731
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,800
- I swear it.
- And your men?

732
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:08,220
- Well, what do they say?
- They swear it too.

733
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,600
Very well.

734
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,920
Both hands, you fool!

735
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,920
That water has got to last until
we reach England.

736
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Or do you want us all
to die of thirst?

737
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,800
Lay down your arms!

738
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,680
Now!

739
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,920
- Do as he says.
- Sir.

740
01:04:23,921 --> 01:04:25,920
Do it!

741
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,920
- I'm sorry, sir.
- It's all right, Finch.

742
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,800
Thank-you,
sir, thank-you.

743
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:51,720
My men are in mind of throwing you
overboard, monsieur.

744
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,530
But,I think you deserve some time

745
01:04:54,531 --> 01:04:58,220
- to reflect on your own stupidity.
- Monsieur?

746
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:01,100
As I told you, I have spent
5 long years

747
01:05:01,101 --> 01:05:03,820
in one of your country's
fine prison hulks,

748
01:05:03,821 --> 01:05:05,840
and I am grateful now for
an opportunity.

749
01:05:05,841 --> 01:05:08,300
to return the courtesy

750
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,600
The chart and compass,
if you please.

751
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:31,080
Fish for it.

752
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
As you were, Styles!

753
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,920
That was a foolish thing to do, boy.

754
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,279
I might have killed you.

755
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,700
And forgo the pleasure of crowing
over my discomfort?

756
01:05:53,701 --> 01:05:55,620
I think not.

757
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,920
Nevertheless, it was a futile act.

758
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,920
All I have to do to gain France is
to turn this boat about

759
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,200
through 180 degrees and
then sail southeast.

760
01:06:06,501 --> 01:06:10,720
- If you can find it.
- Oh, I can read a chart, monsieur.

761
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,820
I only need the sun and
the pole star for reference

762
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:19,920
a feat of navigation that even
you might manage.

763
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,920
- What's to do, sir?
- A crisis of confidence, Styles.

764
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,490
Forget's men are complaining,
and rightly so,

765
01:07:04,491 --> 01:07:07,180
that we should be in sight of
the coast by now.

766
01:07:07,181 --> 01:07:08,999
And where is it, though, sir?

767
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,620
He said he had only to
follow the charts.

768
01:07:11,621 --> 01:07:13,780
So he did.

769
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,725
That would presuppose that our
position upon the chart

770
01:07:15,726 --> 01:07:18,020
was accurately plotted.

771
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,600
Nine against five, the odds of them
gaining the upper hand

772
01:07:22,601 --> 01:07:24,600
were always favourable.

773
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,800
It would be a poor captain that did
not take precautions

774
01:07:26,801 --> 01:07:29,920
against such an eventuality.

775
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,620
So, where have you got our
true position, then, sir?

776
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:36,220
In my head, Matthews.

777
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,720
We were sailing north, not northwest,
when they seized control.

778
01:07:39,721 --> 01:07:41,921
Forget's simply turned us about.

779
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,300
Then we're headed south,
not southeast.

780
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,420
Indeed, Styles.

781
01:07:47,421 --> 01:07:53,200
We're rowing parallel with the coast,
we're getting no closer.

782
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,700
Now you may see how the tree
of indiscipline bears fruit.

783
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:12,300
An interesting situation, Monsieur.

784
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:15,420
Sail to windward!

785
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,700
The Indy!
It's the Indy, sir!

786
01:08:19,901 --> 01:08:21,801
Thank goodness, it is!

787
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:45,200
Right, that's the last one, lads.
Take him away. Lock him up!

788
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,600
So, I'll tell you what he does.
Listen to this.

789
01:08:52,601 --> 01:08:54,670
He drops the compass over
the side,

790
01:08:54,671 --> 01:08:56,720
"Fish for it," says he,
bold as brass.

791
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,780
- He did!
- And him with a pistol in his face.

792
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:03,520
- And so the frog captain?
- Here he comes lads.Step lively now.

793
01:09:05,521 --> 01:09:07,621
Well done, sir.

794
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Mr. Hornblower!

795
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,780
The Marie Galante was damaged
when you boarded her.

796
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,600
And had you had a larger prize
crew you might

797
01:09:27,601 --> 01:09:30,800
have been able to save her.

798
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:35,000
No, better by far that France was
deprived of her cargo

799
01:09:35,001 --> 01:09:37,980
than England should benefit by it.

800
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:40,000
Still,

801
01:09:40,001 --> 01:09:43,280
it's fortunate for you her captain
was so poor a navigator.

802
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,200
else we might never have found you.

803
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:50,100
- No, sir.
- Sail to larboard!

804
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:52,680
Make sail before we lose her!

805
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,180
Darn this fog.

806
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,800
That's one of ours.

807
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:49,120
By God, a Frenchman!
Ship to starboard!

808
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,480
She'll hide in the fog.

809
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:14,320
After her, Mr. Bowles!

810
01:11:14,321 --> 01:11:16,221
Starboard two points.

811
01:11:16,322 --> 01:11:18,122
Starboard two points, sir.

812
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:23,320
We're losing her,
darn it!

813
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,000
Silence!

814
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,800
Where is she?

815
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,800
Where is she?

816
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,120
There she is!
Now we have her!

817
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,050
Mr. Bowles, we're in over our heads.

818
01:12:03,051 --> 01:12:06,600
Take us out of reach of their
shore batteries.

819
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:37,880
Mr. Eccleston, what was the ship
you saw afire?

820
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:42,880
I couldn't see, sir. One of ours,
though, certainly.

821
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,880
Launch boats. Pick up survivors.

822
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:00,200
Over here!

823
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,120
Help us!

824
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,480
Courage boys, you're safe now.

825
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:10,900
Keep shouting, we'll find you!

826
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,520
There they are, sir.

827
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,600
Hold water.

828
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,120
Give him this. Keep him warm.

829
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:48,880
Well, Mr. Hornblower.

830
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:59,200
The Papillon jumped us from the fog.

831
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:04,200
Every time we thought we knew
where she might come from,

832
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,899
she came at us from somewhere else.

833
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:12,820
It was like there were
four ships, not one.

834
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:19,580
Poor Captain Keene. I was standing
with him when he was hit.

835
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,400
Tore his insides out and?

836
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,950
Yes, all right, Mr. Simpson, please,

837
01:14:34,951 --> 01:14:37,400
do not distress yourself
even further.

838
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:40,980
Mr. Bowles, the chart if you please.

839
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:52,380
The mouth of the Gironde,
the Papillon lies just here,

840
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,680
between the shore batteries
of St. Dye and Blaye.

841
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:58,880
You gentlemen, will go in with
the boats and cut her out.

842
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:03,380
Lt. Eccleston will be in general
command. Mr. Eccleston?

843
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,880
As you have seen at first hand,
she is a ship of war,

844
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,880
well-armed and fully crewed.

845
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,880
But, we will be attacking her
at night, taking her by surprise?

846
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:16,880
Kennedy, you'll acquaint Snotty
here with the way of things.

847
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:18,890
Mr. Chadd will command the gig,

848
01:15:18,891 --> 01:15:21,580
Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Hornblower,
the jollyboat.

849
01:15:21,581 --> 01:15:26,880
- Mr. Bowles?
- High water tomorrow is at 4:50. Dawn is at 5:30.

850
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,880
- The attack will?
- So,what's your dirty little secret?

851
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,880
Is it that your mother earns
her living on her back?

852
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:36,820
Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Hornblower,

853
01:15:36,821 --> 01:15:40,390
board as you see fit, and at once
ascend the main rigging.

854
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:43,740
You will ensure that the main
topsail is loosed

855
01:15:43,741 --> 01:15:46,580
and sheeted home, on receipt
of further orders.

856
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,780
I myself,or Mr. Bowles, in the event
I'm killed or wounded?

857
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:53,760
Hornblower! I'm not finished
with you yet, boy.

858
01:15:53,761 --> 01:15:56,880
I'm going to flay you alive!

859
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:59,200
Kennedy, I said 'Wake Hornblower,
not the whole darn ship.?

860
01:15:59,201 --> 01:16:02,800
You mean the coward has wet himself,
has wet himself.

861
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,800
So much for the theory.

862
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,480
Any questions, gentlemen?

863
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:12,880
Sir, I would like to volunteer
to go in with the boats.

864
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,880
If you think you're up to it,
Mr. Simpson.

865
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,880
- Lt. Eccleston?
- We will be glad to have you, Mr. Simpson.

866
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,800
You will go in with Mr. Hornblower
and Mr. Kennedy.

867
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,800
Hello, Archie.

868
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,680
It's been a long time.

869
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,680
Jack's missed you, boy.

870
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,880
We were just catching up on
old times, Mr. Hornblower.

871
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,880
These are new times, Mr. Simpson.

872
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,780
- You have no hold over us here.
- No.

873
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,820
No, I see that.

874
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,200
Time we were away, Archie.

875
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,600
Nervous?

876
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:37,200
Archie?

877
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:40,500
Boat crews away.

878
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Mind what you're doing, sir!
Mind what you're doing!

879
01:18:23,001 --> 01:18:26,580
- What's going on?
- It's Mr. Kennedy, sir. He's having a fit!

880
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:30,880
Mr. Hornblower, can't you keep
your boat quiet!

881
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,680
Shut up.

882
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,200
Archie, for mercy, shut up!

883
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,500
- Do something!
- Sir!

884
01:18:41,501 --> 01:18:43,501
I know, I know.

885
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Mr. Hornblower!

886
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,380
Mr. Hornblower, get your men
aloft quickly now.

887
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,480
Loose the mail topsail.

888
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,120
Styles, Matthews, lay aloft.
Come on men!

889
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,880
- Follow me boys!
- Stevens, wait!

890
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:19,780
There are no foot ropes.
What'll we do, sir? What'll we do?

891
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,600
Mr. Eccleston, the fos'cle is
secured, sir.

892
01:22:31,601 --> 01:22:33,801
Thank-you, Mr. Chadd.

893
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,802
Darn it, why does he delay?

894
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:53,580
If Hornblower doesn't loose
the sails, the attack will fail.

895
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:59,600
Styles, Matthews, starboard yard.
Finch, Oldroyd, follow me.

896
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:08,580
- Drat! Drat! Drat!
- God Blood

897
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,600
Quickly, now, quickly!

898
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,800
Well done!

899
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,400
Archie?

900
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,680
Mr. Chadd's complements, sir,
the ship is ours.

901
01:24:37,681 --> 01:24:40,880
Christ. My compliments
to Mr. Hornblower.

902
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,880
I'm afraid Mr. Hornblower
is dead, sir.

903
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,400
I saw him fall from the yard myself.

904
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:11,300
Ahoy there, Papillon!

905
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,980
Help! Help!

906
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,200
Papillon!.

907
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,320
No sign of the Papillon?

908
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:52,880
They must
have cut her out by now.

909
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,320
Sail to windward!

910
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,680
My goodness, French corvettes!

911
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:09,480
It's not too deep. Head wounds
always bleed terrible bad, sir.

912
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,470
I expect it hurts like the devil,

913
01:26:11,471 --> 01:26:13,680
but you'll mend, praise the Lord.

914
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:16,720
What about Mr. Kennedy?

915
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:20,880
He was still in the boat.

916
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:23,180
She came adrift when we
went about, sir.

917
01:26:23,181 --> 01:26:25,500
That's what Mr. Simpson said.

918
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,880
I swear, you were born
to hang, Mr. Hornblower.

919
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,780
It's a good thing these Frenchmen
are such a poor shot.

920
01:26:48,781 --> 01:26:51,880
French be cursed, I was
shot by Mr. Simpson.

921
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,699
It is a serious accusation,
Mr. Hornblower, and one I trust

922
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:57,500
you would not make without
the evidence to support it.

923
01:26:57,502 --> 01:27:00,302
I have the evidence of
my own eyes, sir.

924
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,880
This is hardly the time or the place
to do anything about it.

925
01:27:04,881 --> 01:27:07,580
Get back to your division,
Mr. Hornblower.

926
01:27:07,581 --> 01:27:11,500
I will address the matter when
we get back to the Indefatigable

927
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,880
- Mr. Chadd?
- It's Mr. Hornblower, sir. Surgeon!

928
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,299
Surgeon!

929
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:38,120
Where is Mr. Chadd?

930
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:45,000
I regret that Lt. Chadd
is dead, sir.

931
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:49,880
The ship is yours, Mr. Hornblower.

932
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:53,600
Take command.

933
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:59,920
Get us back to the Indy...safe.

934
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:13,380
I'm senior here, the ship is mine.

935
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:15,925
Lt. Eccleston instructed me
to take command.

936
01:28:15,926 --> 01:28:17,700
You heard him, Mr. Bowles.

937
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:19,549
Mr. Simpson is senior,
Mr. Hornblower.

938
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:22,420
Styles, Matthews, confine
Mr. Simpson below.

939
01:28:22,421 --> 01:28:25,380
You heard me, Mr. Simpson is
under close arrest.

940
01:28:25,390 --> 01:28:28,880
Who do you think you are? I have
command here!The ship is mine!

941
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:31,880
Any man, any man,
stands against me,

942
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,800
he will regret it!

943
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:40,600
Now, get to work shoring
up this damage.

944
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,680
Get back to work, do you hear?
I have command!

945
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:50,580
Mr. Bowles, you will carry
out my orders.

946
01:28:50,590 --> 01:28:55,380
If Mr. Simpson resists, you have
my permission to shoot him.

947
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,480
Come on!

948
01:29:39,481 --> 01:29:42,081
- Helmsman, hard to starboard.
- Hard to starboard, sir!

949
01:29:42,085 --> 01:29:44,980
Sir, the Papillon!

950
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,200
My goodness, it is the Papillon.

951
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:03,180
- God!
- Mr. Bowles, engage the corvette to larboard.

952
01:30:03,181 --> 01:30:06,880
Engage? Sir, we can't take on
three French corvettes.

953
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,900
We can give the Indy an even chance.

954
01:30:08,901 --> 01:30:10,880
We've a third of her crew
aboard this vessel.

955
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,030
If any of the Frenchmen get
close enough to board her,

956
01:30:13,031 --> 01:30:15,080
- she's finished.
- Aye, aye, sir.

957
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:17,950
Why don't they fire at us, sir?

958
01:30:17,951 --> 01:30:19,880
It may have escaped your
notice, Mr. Bowles,

959
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,680
but we are still flying
French colours.

960
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,760
Shall I have them run down, sir?

961
01:30:24,761 --> 01:30:26,880
If you want me to shoot you
where you stand, by all means.

962
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,400
Sir, it goes against all
articles of war.

963
01:30:29,401 --> 01:30:31,560
When we have leisure, you must
show me where it is written

964
01:30:31,561 --> 01:30:34,000
and I will gladly concede the point.

965
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:38,020
Until that time, please confine
yourself to following my orders

966
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:55,400
Fire!

967
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:02,900
Fire as you bear!

968
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:11,000
Starboard side!

969
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,700
Fire!

970
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:31,700
Fire!

971
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,520
My goodness!

972
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:00,300
Poor devils!

973
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,880
Mr. Hornblower.

974
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,680
They're surrendering, sir!

975
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:10,080
They are surrendering!

976
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:11,981
Three cheers, men.

977
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,880
Launch boats to pick
up survivors, Matthews.

978
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,800
Mr. Bowles,

979
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:30,600
you may raise the Ensign.

980
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:05,600
Timely, Mr. Hornblower, timely.

981
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,880
I take it by your appearance,
Lt. Eccleston is indisposed?

982
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,880
I regret to inform you, sir, that
Lt. Eccleston is dead.

983
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,880
Lt. Chadd is also among the fallen.

984
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,520
I see.

985
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:24,880
Who then had command of the
Papillon during the action?

986
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
The honour fell to me, sir.

987
01:33:27,001 --> 01:33:29,880
How so? What of Mr. Kennedy,
Mr. Simpson?

988
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:32,880
Mr. Kennedy was left behind after
the boarding of the Papillon.

989
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,880
- And Mr. Simpson?
- It's a darn lie, sir!

990
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,880
Begging your pardon...

991
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:41,880
but he's had it in for me ever since
that incident in Spithead.

992
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,880
Mr. Simpson, are you
saying Mr. Hornblower

993
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,480
brought this charge against
you purely out of malice?

994
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:54,200
He's impeached my honour,sir,and
for that I demand satisfaction

995
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:57,880
There, you see, he's afraid.

996
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,880
Mr. Simpson, I would be very
wary of calling a man

997
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,880
only lately distinguished
in battle, a coward.

998
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,880
Oh, I do call him a coward,
and a liar.

999
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,880
If he spoke the truth, he would not
hesitate to face me.

1000
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:14,880
Mr. Hornblower's reluctance to accept
this challenge is, I fear

1001
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,900
the result of an order
I gave him when

1002
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:18,980
he first came aboard Indefatigable,
is that not so?

1003
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,700
Yes, sir.

1004
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:29,880
Mr. Hornblower, I remove
that impediment,

1005
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,680
but I must caution you against
accepting this challenge.

1006
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:38,780
I maintain the charge against
Mr. Simpson, sir.

1007
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:43,880
However, since I cannot prove it
other than with my body,

1008
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,300
I have no choice but to accept
his challenge.

1009
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:52,680
For the last time, gentlemen,
cannot you be reconciled?

1010
01:34:52,681 --> 01:34:57,120
I'm going to kill you, Snotty.
Just as I killed Clayton.

1011
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:02,680
And your little pal, Archie.

1012
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:05,880
- Kennedy?
- Very well.

1013
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,020
You may step out
the distance.

1014
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:13,680
And, one, two, three, four, five.

1015
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,400
Are you ready?

1016
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,800
One,

1017
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,200
Two?

1018
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,480
I did not say, "fire", sir!

1019
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:45,880
It just went off. It's a misfire,
I assure you.

1020
01:35:45,881 --> 01:35:49,320
Is he dead? Did I kill him?

1021
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:53,000
No, you did not!

1022
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,880
Mr. Hornblower, you will
return fire at will.

1023
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:59,380
Return. I shot him.
The duel is over.

1024
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:03,800
You must stand your ground and
attend fire, Mr. Simpson!

1025
01:36:03,801 --> 01:36:06,201
Don't shoot!
No!

1026
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,880
For the love of God,
please don't shoot.

1027
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:13,000
Don't shoot me!

1028
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:20,380
I beg you!

1029
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:31,800
You're not worth the powder.

1030
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:37,920
Not worth the powder?

1031
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:09,680
Exceptionally fine shot, sir,
if I may say so, sir.

1032
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:14,880
You may, Mr. Bowles,
you may.

1033
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:31,400
- Sir.
- Mr. Hornblower.

1034
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,880
You have fought your duel,
that is well.

1035
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,880
Never fight another, that is better.

1036
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,880
I owe you a debt of gratitude, sir.

1037
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,880
I dispensed justice as I saw fit.

1038
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,980
I told you, Mr. Hornblower,I judge
a man by what I see him do.

1039
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,880
Nevertheless, you saved my life.

1040
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:55,880
As you saved the life of every man
aboard this ship, sir.

1041
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Come on man, no false modesty now.

1042
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,880
I see something in you,
Mr. Hornblower.

1043
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,680
If you continue in this service
as you've begun,

1044
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:13,880
- a great future awaits you.
- Thank-you, sir.

1045
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,880
Carry on, Mr. Hornblower.

1046
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,700
Aye, aye, sir.

1047
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:30,880
Styles, coil those cables
down properly now.

1048
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,280
Matthews! Lend a hand there.
