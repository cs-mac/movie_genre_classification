1
00:01:51,286 --> 00:01:54,949
Break's over. Back to
the dance floor. It's swing time.

2
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:03,253
What's cookin', Guy?

3
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:06,733
Hey, you look like your wife
just ran off with the mailman.

4
00:02:06,802 --> 00:02:09,896
I can't laugh, Shirl.
I'm really upset.

5
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:11,803
What is it?

6
00:02:11,873 --> 00:02:15,809
Break's over.
You got a customer waitin'.

7
00:02:15,877 --> 00:02:17,845
Hey, that's not important.

8
00:02:17,913 --> 00:02:21,041
If I have to pick between
business and people...

9
00:02:21,116 --> 00:02:22,583
it's people every time.

10
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,376
Shoot.

11
00:02:25,454 --> 00:02:28,446
It's about one of the employees.

12
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,321
Forget it.
You go on to your customers.

13
00:02:31,393 --> 00:02:33,953
No, no, it's okay.
Go ahead.

14
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:38,398
This employee is a real sweetheart,
but she can't keep her yap shut.

15
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:42,198
She's so busy talking to the stupid
customers about their stupid problems...

16
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,204
it takes her forever
to get to her next lesson.

17
00:02:44,272 --> 00:02:46,604
You want me to talk to her?

18
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:49,405
I'm good with helping people
with their problems.

19
00:02:49,478 --> 00:02:52,276
I've tried.
It doesn't do any good.

20
00:02:52,347 --> 00:02:56,249
What more can I do? Tattoo
"Time is money" on my forehead?

21
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,948
Well, I hate to say this
'cause I see you care.

22
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:03,753
Maybe you're just gonna
have to let her go.

23
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:08,659
Consider it effective immediately.

24
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,230
Me?

25
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,201
You could've knocked me over
with a feather.

26
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,500
Boy, he really set you up.

27
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,700
I can't believe I actually
recommended firing myself.

28
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:23,973
Sometimes I dream about
seeing Guy dropped on his head...

29
00:03:24,046 --> 00:03:25,980
from a tall building.

30
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:28,573
Wait a second.
I have to make a wish.

31
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,347
Shirl, you got to
do this every day?

32
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,412
Do you have a coin?

33
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:38,016
If I don't make my wish,
somethin' bad's gonna happen.

34
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,527
It already happened.
You got fired.

35
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,156
That's just great, Shirl.

36
00:03:44,232 --> 00:03:46,427
What are we supposed
to live on now?

37
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:49,937
I thought you might try
lookin' for a job again.

38
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:51,768
In this stinkin' town?

39
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,833
There ain't no jobs in this town.
I'm sick of lookin'.

40
00:03:55,911 --> 00:03:59,677
This might be a great time
for us to move to Chicago.

41
00:03:59,748 --> 00:04:02,546
Pack our bags
and head to the big city.

42
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,050
What do you say?

43
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,110
You want to pick up
and leave everyone...

44
00:04:06,188 --> 00:04:08,315
leave all our friends.

45
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,188
This town's dyin'.
We're dyin' with it.

46
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:13,750
You been out of work how long?
Eight months, nine?

47
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:17,094
I know you've looked hard,
but it's like you've given up.

48
00:04:17,165 --> 00:04:19,963
Chicago?

49
00:04:20,035 --> 00:04:22,469
What is so goddamn great
about Chicago?

50
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:26,473
What's so great about Chicago
is that it's not Flat River.

51
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,475
You can't even cook, Shirl.

52
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,841
You can't even keep
a half-assed job...

53
00:04:30,912 --> 00:04:33,472
pushing some old farts
around the dance floor.

54
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:36,745
Everything you do gets screwed up.

55
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,678
- Where you goin'?
- Get a couple of beers.

56
00:04:40,756 --> 00:04:43,691
You got a whole
six-pack left.

57
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,159
I'm goin' out, Shirl.

58
00:04:46,228 --> 00:04:48,526
Steve, I'm leavin'.

59
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,898
I'm leavin', Steve!

60
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:54,458
Go on then.

61
00:04:54,536 --> 00:04:56,834
What about us gettin' married?

62
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:59,135
Ain't you been married enough?

63
00:04:59,207 --> 00:05:01,573
I'll see you when I get home.

64
00:05:01,643 --> 00:05:06,273
- I won't be here.
- You wanna bet?

65
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,836
[ "Light Of A Clear

66
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:36,066
I'm taking your bowling bag.

67
00:05:36,144 --> 00:05:40,080
It's been a long dark night

68
00:05:40,148 --> 00:05:44,881
And I been waitin' for morning

69
00:05:44,953 --> 00:05:48,821
It's been a long hard fight

70
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:54,829
But I see a brand-new day
a-dawnin'

71
00:05:54,896 --> 00:06:00,892
I been lookin' for the sunshine

72
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:07,238
'Cause I ain't seen it in so long

73
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:12,303
Everything's gonna
work out just fine

74
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,575
Everything's gonna be all right

75
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:17,914
That's been all wrong

76
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:23,788
'Cause I can see the light
of a clear blue morning

77
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:29,991
I can see the light
of a brand-new day

78
00:06:30,065 --> 00:06:36,903
I can see the light
of a clear blue morning

79
00:06:36,972 --> 00:06:38,997
And everything's
gonna be all right

80
00:06:39,074 --> 00:06:41,838
It's gonna be okay

81
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,341
It's been a long, long time

82
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:54,184
Since I've known
the taste of freedom

83
00:06:54,256 --> 00:06:57,851
And those clinging vines

84
00:06:57,926 --> 00:07:03,956
That had me bound
Well, I don't need 'em

85
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:09,595
'Cause I am strong
and I can prove it

86
00:07:09,671 --> 00:07:16,201
And I got my dreams
to see me through

87
00:07:16,278 --> 00:07:20,578
It's just a mountain I can move it

88
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:27,316
And with faith and love
there's nothing I can't do

89
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:33,294
And I can see the light
of a clear blue morning

90
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:39,095
And I can see the light
of a brand-new day

91
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:39,734
I can see the light
of a clear blue morning

92
00:07:39,735 --> 00:07:46,071
I can see the light
of a clear blue morning

93
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,074
And everything's
gonna be all right

94
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:52,203
It's gonna be okay

95
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:58,617
I can see the light,
I can see the light

96
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:03,214
I can see the light,
I can see the light

97
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:15,994
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!

98
00:08:26,614 --> 00:08:28,673
Hey.!

99
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,411
Hey!

100
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:19,630
I gotcha!

101
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,896
Hold on! Hold on!

102
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:27,566
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

103
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:30,907
I gotcha.
Don't look down.

104
00:09:30,978 --> 00:09:34,846
Put your foot there.

105
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:38,352
Put your arm around me.
Put your arm around my neck.

106
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:40,387
Okay, ready?

107
00:09:41,422 --> 00:09:43,686
Don't look down.

108
00:09:44,592 --> 00:09:47,322
Are you okay?

109
00:09:47,395 --> 00:09:51,525
Are you nuts? Get away from me.
You almost killed me.

110
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:54,295
Wait a minute.
I just saved your life.

111
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:57,065
You could've killed me,
and I lost my 20 bucks.

112
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,868
You weren't trying
to kill yourself?

113
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:02,705
Why should I?
You were gonna do it for me.

114
00:10:02,777 --> 00:10:06,611
- Then I guess I didn't save your life.
- I'm sorry to disappoint you.

115
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:10,447
Maybe somebody'll try to
kill themselves tomorrow.

116
00:10:10,518 --> 00:10:13,043
Well, you don't have to get
sarcastic about it.

117
00:10:13,121 --> 00:10:15,555
It's breakfast time.
Check out the restaurants.

118
00:10:15,623 --> 00:10:19,423
You might find somebody not choking you
can give the Heimlich maneuver to.

119
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:23,794
I took time off work to stop you
from jumping off a bridge.

120
00:10:23,865 --> 00:10:26,390
It isn't my fault you
weren't trying to jump.

121
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:28,628
Okay, you were just tryin' to help.

122
00:10:28,703 --> 00:10:32,639
- Okay, here, here. Take this.
- What are you doin'?

123
00:10:32,707 --> 00:10:35,403
If you're willing to risk
your neck for $20...

124
00:10:35,476 --> 00:10:37,376
you need it more than I do.

125
00:10:37,445 --> 00:10:39,879
It shouldn't cost you money
to do a good deed.

126
00:10:39,947 --> 00:10:43,644
But the next time you want to save
somebody, make sure they need saving.

127
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:48,082
Hey, lady, everybody needs saving.

128
00:11:15,082 --> 00:11:20,418
120, 140, 160, 180.

129
00:11:20,488 --> 00:11:25,050
- Doesn't leave me much for breakfast, does it?
- I wouldn't know.

130
00:11:25,126 --> 00:11:28,220
Doesn't hurt your mouth
to give a smile.

131
00:11:50,952 --> 00:11:53,648
Remember that city hall
deficit scandal piece you did?

132
00:11:53,721 --> 00:11:55,985
That was a great story.

133
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:59,493
And that convicted child molester
who they hired...

134
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,551
to drive a school bus in Waukegan.

135
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:04,530
They do background checks
on new drivers based on that.

136
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,159
- I don't have anything new for you, Milo.
- Nothing?

137
00:12:07,235 --> 00:12:09,169
Nothing's panned out yet.

138
00:12:09,237 --> 00:12:13,469
- It's a big city, Jack. Find me something.
- Don't I always?

139
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,805
Remember, you're only as good...

140
00:12:15,877 --> 00:12:17,811
as your next story.

141
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:20,211
Big city, Jack.

142
00:12:35,196 --> 00:12:37,187
Thanks, lady.

143
00:12:42,103 --> 00:12:45,971
Miss, I'll have that
early bird special and coffee.

144
00:12:47,108 --> 00:12:50,805
One big spender, comin' up.

145
00:12:50,878 --> 00:12:52,971
That's one juice.

146
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,450
Thank you.

147
00:12:57,718 --> 00:13:01,085
- Excuse me, would you pass me the sugar?
- Sure.

148
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:05,091
- Damn it to hell!
- I'm sorry.

149
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,649
I am so sorry.

150
00:13:06,727 --> 00:13:11,960
It's not the coffee.
I am just so ticked off.

151
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:14,695
You want to talk about it?

152
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:19,570
Did you ever try dating a workaholic
when their work's not going so great?

153
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,074
No, I never did date a workaholic.

154
00:13:22,143 --> 00:13:24,805
I sometimes wish I had, though.

155
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:27,439
The guys I date don't
work at all mostly.

156
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,449
Believe me, it's no picnic.

157
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,611
He makes dates, breaks them,
stays at the office all night.

158
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:36,885
Another woman I could fight, but
how do you compete against a job?

159
00:13:36,957 --> 00:13:39,482
Where are you when
he breaks these dates?

160
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,221
Waiting for him.

161
00:13:41,295 --> 00:13:44,321
- Maybe that's your problem.
- What do you mean?

162
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:47,526
Why should he hurry home
if he knows you're there?

163
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:51,059
He's taking you for granted.
Get on with your life.

164
00:13:51,138 --> 00:13:54,505
If he wants you, you're busy.
He'll come around or he won't.

165
00:13:54,575 --> 00:13:56,873
Either way you'll
be livin', not waitin'.

166
00:13:59,647 --> 00:14:01,478
That makes sense.

167
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:05,645
Sometimes you got to get out
and honk your own horn.

168
00:14:06,921 --> 00:14:09,185
The early bird special.

169
00:14:10,591 --> 00:14:13,788
Boy, the bird part's right.

170
00:14:25,873 --> 00:14:29,536
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It was an all-nighter, again.

171
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,478
I didn't call 'cause I kept
thinking I was gonna finish up.

172
00:14:33,547 --> 00:14:37,005
I didn't wanna wake you.
I hope you didn't wait up.

173
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,848
No, I didn't wait up.

174
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,946
As a matter of fact, I went out.

175
00:14:43,023 --> 00:14:46,356
Good, good.
What do you mean "out"?

176
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:50,523
- I went out with a friend.
- Good. Good.

177
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,793
What do you mean, "a friend"?

178
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:54,562
Why are you so suspicious?

179
00:14:54,635 --> 00:14:57,536
I don't question you
about being at work.

180
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,039
If I say I'm at work, I'm at work.

181
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,598
I can vouch for his being at work.
That's what he told me.

182
00:15:02,676 --> 00:15:04,268
Why would he lie to me?

183
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:06,370
- God!
- You know each other?

184
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,881
He tried to push me off
a bridge this morning.

185
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,349
I tried to stop you from jumping.

186
00:15:11,418 --> 00:15:14,046
- I was not tryin' to jump.
- Excuse me.

187
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:17,284
- I'll make it up to you tonight.
- I'm busy tonight.

188
00:15:17,358 --> 00:15:19,622
- Are you gonna eat that?
- Go right ahead.

189
00:15:19,693 --> 00:15:22,253
How can you be busy tonight?

190
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:25,025
- I made other plans, Jack.
- What other plans?

191
00:15:25,099 --> 00:15:27,567
I want to go on with my life.

192
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,569
I want to live, not wait.

193
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:33,664
I'm going to honk my
own horn for a change.

194
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:36,039
What have you done with Janice?

195
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,045
I didn't realize how much
you'd been taking me for granted...

196
00:15:39,113 --> 00:15:41,081
until it was pointed out to me.

197
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,049
What brilliant mind
pointed that out?

198
00:15:44,118 --> 00:15:47,110
You want to wreck
my entire day, lady?

199
00:15:47,188 --> 00:15:49,713
I don't want to get
in the middle of this.

200
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,123
- It's a little late.
- This is not about her, this is about you.

201
00:15:53,194 --> 00:15:56,129
You wanna know what your
problem is? You're at work.

202
00:15:56,197 --> 00:15:58,631
When you're not at work,
you're brooding about work.

203
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:01,133
So let me tell you
where I'm gonna be.

204
00:16:01,202 --> 00:16:04,933
I am going to be out with
someone that really values me.

205
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,997
- This woman...
- Shirlee.

206
00:16:08,075 --> 00:16:11,602
Made me see that
I can do a lot better.

207
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,613
So long, Jack.

208
00:16:23,724 --> 00:16:25,658
Thank you...

209
00:16:25,726 --> 00:16:28,661
- Shirlee.
- Shirlee.

210
00:16:28,729 --> 00:16:31,095
It's been a great
thrill meeting you.

211
00:16:31,165 --> 00:16:34,032
I wish it were
a little later in life...

212
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:36,467
like on my deathbed.

213
00:16:51,018 --> 00:16:54,215
It's a dirty job
but somebody's gotta do it

214
00:16:54,288 --> 00:16:57,382
Better get to it Somebody's
gotta do it whatever it takes

215
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,888
Shh!

216
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,826
A NY work at all
is better than none

217
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,562
Better buckle down to it
gotta get the job done

218
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:10,900
Gotta earn my pay

219
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:12,836
I gotta earn my pay

220
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:16,570
Excuse me. I came
to see about the job.

221
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:21,103
I don't think so.

222
00:17:21,181 --> 00:17:24,446
Somebody's gotta do it, do it

223
00:17:24,518 --> 00:17:27,009
Somebody's gotta do it, do it

224
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,578
Somebody

225
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:32,922
I can think of better
things I'd rather do

226
00:17:32,993 --> 00:17:35,689
I might get lucky and I'm hoping to

227
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:40,860
But until I do I gotta compromise

228
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,733
The job ain't much
but at least it's mine

229
00:17:43,804 --> 00:17:46,238
It beats standing in
the unemployment line

230
00:17:46,307 --> 00:17:50,573
Put pride aside and I improvise

231
00:17:50,644 --> 00:17:53,909
Even if I do get a better job

232
00:17:53,981 --> 00:17:57,280
Somebody else has got
to fill my spot

233
00:17:57,351 --> 00:18:00,047
Somebody's gotta do it, do it

234
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,782
Somebody's gotta do it, do it

235
00:18:02,856 --> 00:18:05,416
Somebody's gotta do it, do it

236
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:08,689
Somebody, somebody

237
00:18:08,762 --> 00:18:10,787
Somebody's gotta do it

238
00:18:10,864 --> 00:18:13,594
Somebody's gotta do it, yeah

239
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:19,162
It's a funky job,
it's a low-down dirty job

240
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:28,543
Great, Angel.
Now show us your tits.

241
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,862
Even if the rules
are too hard to follow

242
00:18:43,931 --> 00:18:46,695
Even when pride
is too hard to swallow

243
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:50,066
- It was a "dry" T-shirt contest.
- You are funny, Bob.

244
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:53,300
Bill, there's something really
ugly crawling up your shirt.

245
00:18:53,374 --> 00:18:56,810
- That's my tie, Bob.
- Sorry, Bill.

246
00:18:56,877 --> 00:19:00,677
It's time for the morning traffic.

247
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:03,842
Today's morning traffic
report brought to you by...

248
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:07,216
Chateau J. Simpson, the wine
that used to play football.

249
00:19:07,287 --> 00:19:10,916
W-N-D-Y. I'll put you right through.

250
00:19:10,991 --> 00:19:15,587
Okay, ice cream delivery,
waitress, cocktail waitress...

251
00:19:15,662 --> 00:19:18,631
- bartender.
- I was just workin' my way up.

252
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,167
Waitress, manicurist...
No reception work.

253
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:26,331
- Hello, W-N-D-Y.
- Not exactly, but I have a phone.

254
00:19:26,407 --> 00:19:29,672
I've answered phones.
Who hasn't?

255
00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:33,201
I'd really like to hire you, but you
need experience to work a VMX-2000.

256
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,942
Hello, W-N-D-Y.

257
00:19:36,016 --> 00:19:38,007
W-N-D-Y.
Hold please.

258
00:19:38,085 --> 00:19:41,020
Hello, W-N-D-Y.
Mr. Perlman.

259
00:19:41,088 --> 00:19:43,352
Yes, I'll put you right through.

260
00:19:43,424 --> 00:19:46,882
I may not be exactly
what you're huntin' for...

261
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,794
but sometimes a dog runs
the wrong squirrel up the right tree.

262
00:19:50,864 --> 00:19:52,456
Pardon me?

263
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:56,264
It's something
my daddy used to say.

264
00:19:56,336 --> 00:19:59,430
That's a good-lookin' man.
Is that your husband?

265
00:19:59,506 --> 00:20:02,304
That's my soon-to-be
ex-husband.

266
00:20:02,376 --> 00:20:04,537
Like a punch in the gut?

267
00:20:04,611 --> 00:20:06,943
Girl, you don't know.

268
00:20:07,014 --> 00:20:10,074
I do know.
Believe me, I do know.

269
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,380
I agree. Stanford
was a little dull.

270
00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:15,684
People fell asleep at
the wheel listening to her.

271
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,986
I made a slight error in judgment.

272
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:21,926
If Stanford was a slight error,
what was that last bozo you hired?

273
00:20:21,995 --> 00:20:24,225
I want someone with a PhD.

274
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:27,290
The other stations get them
and they're killing us in the ratings.

275
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:30,825
People want to confide
their problems to a doctor.

276
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:34,806
So who did you hire to
destroy my ratings now?

277
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:38,242
This one's perfect.
Her name's Dr. Kendall.

278
00:20:38,312 --> 00:20:41,748
Three cities were dying for her.
I outbid 'em all.

279
00:20:41,815 --> 00:20:43,840
I interviewed her personally.

280
00:20:43,917 --> 00:20:47,182
- She's just what you wanted.
- A doctor?

281
00:20:47,254 --> 00:20:50,553
A trained clinical psychologist.
Three letters after her name.

282
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,819
I don't want anyone
too dry and technical.

283
00:20:52,893 --> 00:20:56,021
- She's willing to talk down to our audience.
- Not talk down.

284
00:20:56,096 --> 00:20:58,030
Talk with.
That's what I meant.

285
00:20:58,098 --> 00:21:01,659
She'd better be all you say she is
for your sake, Alan.

286
00:21:01,735 --> 00:21:04,203
All right, let's go, go.

287
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,148
You can ignore this row. It goes
straight to the Stanford show.

288
00:21:07,163 --> 00:21:09,903
You can ignore this row. It goes
straight to the Stanford show.

289
00:21:09,976 --> 00:21:11,705
- Stanford?
- The call-in shrink.

290
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:15,544
Actually, there's a new one coming
in today. Name's Dr. Kendall.

291
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:17,810
You gonna be all right?

292
00:21:17,884 --> 00:21:19,613
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

293
00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:23,520
W-N-D-Y. Hello, this is Shirlee.

294
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:26,524
- You just put 'em on hold.
- Yeah.

295
00:21:26,592 --> 00:21:30,688
- Now you just cut 'em off.
- That was a personal choice.

296
00:21:30,763 --> 00:21:34,130
- I'll be back real soon.
- Okay.

297
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,102
W-N-D-Y. Hello, this is Shirlee.

298
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:41,231
Can I put you through?
I'm sure gonna try.

299
00:21:43,676 --> 00:21:46,611
Pet Corner. Do you have a question?

300
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:50,376
- My bull terrier... - We're only
taking questions on reptiles.

301
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,385
- Pet Corner.
- Do snakes have nipples?

302
00:21:53,453 --> 00:21:55,148
Good question.

303
00:21:55,221 --> 00:21:59,885
- - W-N-D-Y. Please hold.
W-N-D-Y. Please hold.

304
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:04,191
W-N-D-Y. I know you've been
holding and you should be grateful.

305
00:22:04,263 --> 00:22:06,731
Everybody else got cut off.

306
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,202
Five minutes.-

307
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:14,296
- Yo.
- Where's this new doc?

308
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:18,310
- You got me. What if she doesn't show?
- Play yesterday's news.

309
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,006
Then a right and I'm
in the coffee room.

310
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,572
- Got it. Thanks.
- Shirlee.

311
00:22:29,489 --> 00:22:32,322
A three-car pileup has
the left lane of Kennedy...

312
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,622
snarling traffic
in the O'Hare area.

313
00:22:34,694 --> 00:22:37,322
Traffic in the western suburbs
is moving smoothly.

314
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,662
Folks along Lake Shore Drive
are battling construction...

315
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:44,965
and a disabled vehicle,
closing the right lane.

316
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:48,235
Where's the coffee
machine? Thanks.

317
00:22:48,307 --> 00:22:51,071
Temperatures are expected
to top out in the mid-80s.

318
00:22:51,144 --> 00:22:53,738
Look for relief within
the next couple of days.

319
00:22:53,813 --> 00:22:57,249
A high-pressure front
is headed back east...

320
00:22:57,316 --> 00:23:02,481
bringing lower temperatures
and a possibility of rain.

321
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:06,047
In sports, the Cubbies win after going
extra innings against the Pirates.

322
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:11,028
A sacrifice fly by Andre Dawson
homered in the winning run.

323
00:23:17,937 --> 00:23:19,598
This must be our girl.

324
00:23:19,672 --> 00:23:21,196
Kendall. Kendall?

325
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,435
Kendall, behind you. Kendall.

326
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:25,909
- Yes, hello.
- It's Kenyon.

327
00:23:25,978 --> 00:23:29,414
- Shirlee Kenyon.
- I'm sorry. I have Kendall.

328
00:23:29,482 --> 00:23:31,712
I ought to know my own name.

329
00:23:31,784 --> 00:23:34,685
You got any real cream?
This stuff will kill you.

330
00:23:34,754 --> 00:23:37,018
I'm Tony de Santis, your producer.

331
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,388
That's Gordon Sussman.
He's the engineer.

332
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:42,019
- Hi, Kendall.
- Kenyon.

333
00:23:42,095 --> 00:23:44,586
- 20 seconds.
- Nice meetin' ya.

334
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:46,632
No time for jokes.

335
00:23:46,699 --> 00:23:50,157
The hold button says hold.
The kill button's next to it.

336
00:23:50,236 --> 00:23:54,070
Kill button?
I just came in for coffee.

337
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,573
Put your headphones on.

338
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:59,941
- You want me to go on the radio?
- That's very funny.

339
00:24:00,012 --> 00:24:02,378
Hey now, my job description...

340
00:24:02,448 --> 00:24:04,712
W-N-D-Y,
Chicago radio...

341
00:24:04,784 --> 00:24:07,344
invites you to participate
in a program...

342
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,854
designed to help you find
a more productive life.

343
00:24:09,922 --> 00:24:12,550
Talk radio is about
sharing your concerns...

344
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,957
and helping to find answers
through creative solutions.

345
00:24:15,027 --> 00:24:19,487
And now, W-N-D-Y's
Dr. Shirlee Kendall.

346
00:24:19,565 --> 00:24:21,499
Kenyon.

347
00:24:21,567 --> 00:24:24,058
Hello? Hello, Dr. Kendall?

348
00:24:24,137 --> 00:24:26,605
My son and my husband
are fighting again...

349
00:24:26,672 --> 00:24:29,106
Hang on.-

350
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:31,803
This was not in my job description.

351
00:24:31,878 --> 00:24:33,971
Hello, are you there?

352
00:24:34,046 --> 00:24:36,378
Last night, my son hit my husband.

353
00:24:36,449 --> 00:24:40,283
He's 18 and a bodybuilder.
My son, not my husband.

354
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:44,255
- Who is this?
- This is Gladys from Northbrook.

355
00:24:44,323 --> 00:24:46,587
Do I know you?-

356
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:50,117
I tried calling before.-

357
00:24:50,196 --> 00:24:52,630
- - The girl at lunchtime
when I was up front.

358
00:24:52,698 --> 00:24:55,633
I must've cut you off.
Lord, I'm sorry about that.

359
00:24:55,701 --> 00:24:58,101
It was crazy around here.

360
00:24:58,171 --> 00:25:01,402
Go ahead, Gladys.
What happened then?

361
00:25:01,474 --> 00:25:03,567
Tell me everything.

362
00:25:03,643 --> 00:25:07,477
My gosh.
That's just terrible.

363
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,742
Maybe you could...

364
00:25:09,815 --> 00:25:12,511
Gladys, I don't know what to say.

365
00:25:12,585 --> 00:25:14,883
Well, say something. God!

366
00:25:14,954 --> 00:25:17,889
That's one of the worst
things I've ever heard.

367
00:25:17,957 --> 00:25:21,324
This is a doctor?
I could be saying this stuff!

368
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:25,330
This is Donald. I'm 50.
My mother's in her 70s.

369
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:29,596
She moved in with me and she
still treats me like a child.

370
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:32,433
She tells me what to do
in my own home.

371
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:34,439
She's just drivin' me crazy.

372
00:25:34,507 --> 00:25:37,943
Have her put to sleep.
No, I'm just kiddin'.

373
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:40,501
- She's your mother.
- Okay, okay.

374
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,548
Excuse me.
Comin' through.

375
00:25:42,615 --> 00:25:45,345
One mama can take care
of ten kids...

376
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:48,717
but ten kids can't
take care of one mama.

377
00:25:48,788 --> 00:25:50,881
Let's go! Let's go!

378
00:25:50,957 --> 00:25:53,391
You've stopped sleeping
with your wife.

379
00:25:53,459 --> 00:25:57,691
- Isn't that what you're tryin' to say?
- I guess it is, yes.

380
00:25:57,763 --> 00:26:01,631
- So who you foolin' around with?
- It's not that at all.

381
00:26:01,701 --> 00:26:04,261
I just lost interest in her.

382
00:26:04,337 --> 00:26:06,931
Yeah, and who are you
foolin' around with?

383
00:26:07,006 --> 00:26:09,201
A girl in my office.

384
00:26:09,275 --> 00:26:13,473
You got a wife, and
you got a girlfriend in the office?

385
00:26:13,546 --> 00:26:16,344
Did you say your name was
"Bud"or "Stud"?

386
00:26:16,415 --> 00:26:18,645
I'm sorry.

387
00:26:18,718 --> 00:26:22,745
You're livin' your life so crooked,
you have to screw your socks on.

388
00:26:22,822 --> 00:26:25,814
Havin' an affair is like
shootin' pool on two tables.

389
00:26:25,891 --> 00:26:29,486
You may have the balls, but
you're gonna wear out your stick.

390
00:26:29,562 --> 00:26:32,463
What is going on over there?

391
00:26:32,531 --> 00:26:34,556
Hi, this is Tina.

392
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,159
Tina, this is Shirlee.
What's cookin'?

393
00:26:37,236 --> 00:26:42,640
The boss gave me notice. I was the
hardest-working waitress in the place.

394
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:45,233
He said I was messin' up
too many orders.

395
00:26:45,311 --> 00:26:48,337
When I came home
and told my husband Ken...

396
00:26:48,414 --> 00:26:51,383
he looked at me like
I was somethin' horrible.

397
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:56,945
And he said... I don't think I can
handle this on the radio.

398
00:26:57,023 --> 00:26:59,924
Take your time, Tina.
I got no place to go.

399
00:26:59,992 --> 00:27:04,190
He said that I was a loser,
that I couldn't hold a job...

400
00:27:04,263 --> 00:27:07,755
the house was always a mess...

401
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:10,927
and if it weren't for him
I couldn't make it.

402
00:27:11,003 --> 00:27:16,270
- He said all that to you?
- Yes, he did.

403
00:27:16,342 --> 00:27:18,936
You sure?
Sure you're sure.

404
00:27:19,011 --> 00:27:22,276
Tina, listen. I want you
to march up to this guy.

405
00:27:22,348 --> 00:27:25,715
Tell him that you're doin'
the very best you can.

406
00:27:25,785 --> 00:27:28,948
If he can't appreciate it,
you're not gonna take this crap...

407
00:27:29,021 --> 00:27:32,252
that you can do just fine
on your own, thank you...

408
00:27:32,325 --> 00:27:34,759
and that he's gonna be damn sorry.

409
00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:39,457
Then grab your bowling bag
and get the hell out of there!

410
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,762
Sometimes you gotta
honk your own horn.

411
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:44,234
If you don't, nobody's
gonna know you're comin'.

412
00:27:44,303 --> 00:27:47,170
That's it.
Wrap it up. Wrap it up.

413
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:49,002
Say "bye." Bye-bye.

414
00:27:49,075 --> 00:27:51,305
Say good-bye.

415
00:27:51,377 --> 00:27:54,346
It's been real nice spendin'
this time with you.

416
00:27:54,413 --> 00:27:56,472
And like my daddy used to say...

417
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:59,848
quickest way to forget your problems
is to listen to somebody else's.

418
00:28:12,797 --> 00:28:15,231
Move that car.!

419
00:28:18,236 --> 00:28:21,103
Sorry.

420
00:28:21,172 --> 00:28:24,573
That was unbelievable. I have
never seen anything like that.

421
00:28:24,643 --> 00:28:27,009
I didn't fall asleep once.

422
00:28:27,078 --> 00:28:30,639
That was the most horrifying...

423
00:28:30,715 --> 00:28:33,980
the worst display of, of, of...

424
00:28:34,052 --> 00:28:35,986
Who are you?

425
00:28:36,054 --> 00:28:38,147
- Who is she?
- Dr. Kenyon.

426
00:28:38,223 --> 00:28:40,783
- Who is Dr. Kenyon?
- You just hired her.

427
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:43,657
- I didn't hire her. I hired Dr. Kimball.
- Kendall.

428
00:28:43,728 --> 00:28:46,663
Kenyon. What's the difference?
She's a natural.

429
00:28:46,731 --> 00:28:49,495
You don't talk.
Maybe never again.

430
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:52,866
I'm gonna make my way
back to the switchboard.

431
00:28:52,938 --> 00:28:55,964
Walk past the switchboard and get
your butt out of this building.

432
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:59,704
This is not her fault.
Your Dr. Kendall didn't show up.

433
00:28:59,778 --> 00:29:02,645
I thought Kenyon was Kendall
and I put her on the air.

434
00:29:09,955 --> 00:29:12,947
I want to be absolutely
fair about this.

435
00:29:13,024 --> 00:29:16,289
You're both fired!

436
00:29:21,933 --> 00:29:24,868
Yeah, I've got her
leaving the building.

437
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:44,182
Blue me

438
00:29:44,255 --> 00:29:48,851
Blue me

439
00:29:50,528 --> 00:29:53,190
Hello, Steve.
It's me, Shirlee.

440
00:29:53,264 --> 00:29:57,030
I can't talk long.
I ain't got much money.

441
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:02,331
Well, I'm sorry you went bowling
and didn't have your bowling bag.

442
00:30:02,407 --> 00:30:06,207
Don't you even want
to know where I am?

443
00:30:06,277 --> 00:30:11,010
Well, if I was comin' back, I wouldn't
forget your precious bowling bag.

444
00:30:11,082 --> 00:30:13,949
But I ain't comin' back
'cause I got this great job...

445
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:15,953
and I'm startin' tomorrow.

446
00:30:16,021 --> 00:30:18,717
All my dreams are gonna come true.

447
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:21,953
I'm blue

448
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:25,861
I'm just as blue as can be

449
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,898
Blue me

450
00:30:27,966 --> 00:30:30,730
Blue me

451
00:30:32,604 --> 00:30:36,631
- Hey, Kenyon. - I just checked
out. Forwarding address unknown.

452
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:41,236
Mr. Riegert from W-N-D-Y sent me
to take you down to the station.

453
00:30:41,312 --> 00:30:43,678
Shirlee Kenyon?

454
00:30:43,748 --> 00:30:46,182
Hey, look, I didn't
want to be on the radio...

455
00:30:46,251 --> 00:30:48,913
but there's no law
against it, is there?

456
00:30:48,987 --> 00:30:53,390
- I thought you were great.
- You did? Who are you?

457
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:56,586
Name's Casey. It will be
my pleasure to drive you.

458
00:30:56,661 --> 00:31:00,119
That's very sweet of you, Casey,
but I won't be needing the ride.

459
00:31:06,271 --> 00:31:08,831
Why don't you do us both a favor...

460
00:31:08,907 --> 00:31:11,205
and tell them I wasn't here.

461
00:31:11,276 --> 00:31:15,337
Please, Miss Kenyon. You don't
want to get me in trouble, do you?

462
00:31:15,413 --> 00:31:18,211
- No.
- Then let me do my job.

463
00:31:27,292 --> 00:31:31,023
Do you know what's happened
since you left here yesterday?

464
00:31:31,096 --> 00:31:34,122
You hired someone else
to answer the phone?

465
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:37,862
We've received over 500 calls.

466
00:31:37,936 --> 00:31:39,904
I might've cut a few people off...

467
00:31:39,971 --> 00:31:42,371
We've never seen anything like it.

468
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,342
They love you.
They absolutely love you.

469
00:31:46,411 --> 00:31:48,379
Look at these.

470
00:31:51,082 --> 00:31:54,051
- That's right.
- Are there any more?

471
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:57,350
Yes, yes! Hundreds.

472
00:31:57,422 --> 00:31:59,356
Wow!

473
00:32:00,992 --> 00:32:05,793
- I am prepared to offer you your own program.
- My own program?

474
00:32:05,864 --> 00:32:09,231
It's two hours a day, five days a
week at... What were we paying you?

475
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:13,134
- 250.
- I'm prepared to double that.

476
00:32:13,204 --> 00:32:16,662
Double my salary
and no reception work?

477
00:32:16,741 --> 00:32:19,209
No reception work.

478
00:32:22,413 --> 00:32:26,645
- Hey, wait a minute. This says Doctor Shirlee.
- Right.

479
00:32:26,718 --> 00:32:29,551
The boss wants a doctor,
so that's what you are.

480
00:32:29,621 --> 00:32:31,714
Sign it.
It's not important.

481
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:34,724
Of course it's important.
It's not true.

482
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,893
Okay, $800 a week.

483
00:32:38,963 --> 00:32:41,591
But it still says Doctor Shirlee.

484
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:43,657
Listen, listen.

485
00:32:43,735 --> 00:32:46,636
Captain Kangaroo
wasn't really a captain.

486
00:32:46,704 --> 00:32:48,695
He wasn't even a kangaroo.

487
00:32:48,773 --> 00:32:51,537
Besides, no one's
ever going to know.

488
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:54,578
I'm gonna come up with
a first-rate bio for you.

489
00:32:54,646 --> 00:32:58,104
It's just gonna be between
you and me and the lamppost.

490
00:32:58,183 --> 00:33:00,378
In fact, not even the lamppost.

491
00:33:01,953 --> 00:33:06,981
I just don't feel comfortable
pretending to be something I'm not.

492
00:33:07,058 --> 00:33:09,891
If I thought I was doing
a disservice to the public...

493
00:33:09,961 --> 00:33:12,862
I would be the first to say so.

494
00:33:12,931 --> 00:33:15,456
You already went on
the air as a doctor.

495
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:18,195
If you go on and say,
"I'm not a doctor,"

496
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:20,260
what are your listeners
gonna think?

497
00:33:20,338 --> 00:33:23,364
They're gonna think
I'm not a doctor.

498
00:33:24,943 --> 00:33:29,403
Hey, you... you are a doctor...

499
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,414
of the heart.

500
00:33:31,482 --> 00:33:33,416
You're a doctor of the heart.

501
00:33:33,484 --> 00:33:35,543
You help people.

502
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,884
Look at these telegrams.
They love you.

503
00:33:37,956 --> 00:33:40,584
Are you gonna
let these people down?

504
00:33:46,231 --> 00:33:48,461
The man's a real ball buster.

505
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:50,660
That's not a problem for me.

506
00:33:50,735 --> 00:33:52,760
He can be very difficult.

507
00:33:52,837 --> 00:33:56,773
Don't forget.
It's doctor, doctor, doctor.

508
00:33:56,841 --> 00:34:00,572
- And also... - Also wear clean
underwear in case I get in a wreck.

509
00:34:00,645 --> 00:34:02,704
Gene, this is...

510
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,943
The woman that saved
that damn shrink spot.

511
00:34:06,017 --> 00:34:08,451
You've got the real common touch.

512
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:10,510
I like that, Kendall.

513
00:34:10,588 --> 00:34:12,988
Kenyon. My mistake.

514
00:34:13,057 --> 00:34:15,457
But there...

515
00:34:15,526 --> 00:34:19,860
There is a question that I'm afraid
I'm going to have to ask you, Kenyon.

516
00:34:22,734 --> 00:34:26,329
Whatever it is, Mr. Perlman,
you'll get a truthful answer.

517
00:34:26,404 --> 00:34:31,205
Then tell me, how did you
get to be so darn pretty?

518
00:34:34,779 --> 00:34:38,215
I want to publicize
the hell out of her.

519
00:34:38,283 --> 00:34:40,274
Ads, promos, billboards.

520
00:34:40,351 --> 00:34:44,583
Or maybe we should give Shirlee
a little time to settle into it...

521
00:34:44,656 --> 00:34:46,487
and then build an audience.

522
00:34:46,557 --> 00:34:49,993
But that's how we
build an audience, Alan.

523
00:34:50,061 --> 00:34:54,225
Why keep our biggest
potential asset under wraps?

524
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:58,602
You were fantastic in there.

525
00:34:58,603 --> 00:34:59,228
You were fantastic in there.

526
00:34:59,304 --> 00:35:03,798
You played him like a violin.
You're my girl.

527
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:08,778
I wish Steve could see me now.
Boy, he'd eat his words.

528
00:35:08,846 --> 00:35:10,780
Steve's the ex-husband?

529
00:35:10,848 --> 00:35:13,146
No, Steve's the guy
I was living with...

530
00:35:13,217 --> 00:35:15,481
after the last time
me and Leland got divorced.

531
00:35:15,553 --> 00:35:18,784
The last time?
How many times you been...?

532
00:35:18,856 --> 00:35:21,791
Three times. You've been
married three times?

533
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:25,158
Yeah, but to the same guy.

534
00:35:25,229 --> 00:35:28,824
He left, he came back.
We got married, we got divorced.

535
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,233
He got put in jail for shooting
a ready-teller machine.

536
00:35:32,303 --> 00:35:34,703
We got divorced.
It went on and on.

537
00:35:34,772 --> 00:35:37,366
It was such a mess.

538
00:35:47,518 --> 00:35:51,386
You tell no one anything
about your past.

539
00:35:51,456 --> 00:35:54,254
Anything.
I don't want you ever...

540
00:35:54,325 --> 00:35:57,692
Don't talk about your past
at all, to anyone.

541
00:35:57,762 --> 00:36:00,595
No interviews 'til I make up
something right for you.

542
00:36:00,665 --> 00:36:03,964
- Okay?
- Now wait a minute.

543
00:36:04,035 --> 00:36:06,697
I don't think I'm
gonna feel comfortable...

544
00:36:06,771 --> 00:36:09,035
lyin' about who I am
and where I'm from.

545
00:36:09,107 --> 00:36:11,166
You've got a lot to offer...

546
00:36:11,242 --> 00:36:15,008
and I would hate to see
people miss out on it...

547
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:19,379
because of a few little mistakes you
might have made in your past.

548
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:21,418
Let me handle your life.

549
00:36:21,486 --> 00:36:24,284
You just go out, live it.

550
00:36:32,797 --> 00:36:34,958
Gimme some straight talk,
straight talk

551
00:36:35,032 --> 00:36:37,000
And hold the sugar please

552
00:36:37,068 --> 00:36:39,161
Straight talk, straight talk

553
00:36:39,237 --> 00:36:41,432
Sounds plenty sweet to me

554
00:36:41,506 --> 00:36:45,374
Don't talk to me in circles
in some mumbo-jumbo jive

555
00:36:45,443 --> 00:36:48,640
Gimme just straight talk,
straight talk

556
00:36:48,713 --> 00:36:51,045
And we're gonna be all right

557
00:36:52,984 --> 00:36:54,918
Hi, this is Dr. Shirlee.

558
00:36:54,986 --> 00:36:57,750
What the announcement said,
I really mean.

559
00:36:57,822 --> 00:37:00,882
I'm here to talk about
your problems and concerns.

560
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:02,949
Anything goes
so let's not be shy...

561
00:37:03,027 --> 00:37:04,619
'cause you're among friends.

562
00:37:04,695 --> 00:37:07,926
Our first caller...
Good grief.

563
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:10,729
Look at me.

564
00:37:10,802 --> 00:37:13,066
What a mess!

565
00:37:13,137 --> 00:37:16,903
I wish this was on TV so you
could see how messy I really am.

566
00:37:16,974 --> 00:37:20,410
I'm busier than a one-legged man
in a butt-kickin' contest.

567
00:37:20,478 --> 00:37:23,914
Straight talk, straight talk

568
00:37:23,981 --> 00:37:26,575
So come on let's talk turkey

569
00:37:26,651 --> 00:37:30,052
Just straight and to the point
about passions, about problems

570
00:37:30,121 --> 00:37:32,316
A bout noses out of joint

571
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:35,655
Now I want you all to know I care

572
00:37:35,726 --> 00:37:37,921
And I do understaNd

573
00:37:37,995 --> 00:37:40,862
And hey thanks for lendin' me
an ear out there in radio laNd

574
00:37:40,932 --> 00:37:43,730
No, Martha, it isn't fair,
but life isn't fair.

575
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:46,235
Even the Declaration
of Independence...

576
00:37:46,304 --> 00:37:49,239
only guarantees life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness.

577
00:37:49,307 --> 00:37:51,741
It doesn't say anything about fair.

578
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:55,336
Doesn't even say you have a right
to be happy, just to pursue it.

579
00:37:55,413 --> 00:37:58,780
But no one
appreciates me and I try to be fair.

580
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:02,183
Get down off the cross, honey.
Somebody needs the wood.

581
00:38:04,322 --> 00:38:08,452
Straight talk, straight talk
there's nothin' like the truth

582
00:38:08,526 --> 00:38:10,517
Just tell me all your troubles

583
00:38:10,595 --> 00:38:13,155
Pretend I'm Donahue

584
00:38:13,231 --> 00:38:15,426
So don't be shy 'cause we can talk

585
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,197
- Is that for me?
- It's all yours.

586
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:21,670
I feel like Mary Kay!

587
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:23,934
Hello, Shirlee here.

588
00:38:24,008 --> 00:38:27,273
Yeah, hi, Dr. Shirlee.

589
00:38:27,345 --> 00:38:30,906
Um, I think I'm falling in love
with a girl at work.

590
00:38:30,982 --> 00:38:33,542
I don't know how to tell her.

591
00:38:39,257 --> 00:38:41,817
You little flirt.

592
00:38:41,893 --> 00:38:47,331
And now Nancy will continue our week-long
series on talk radio psychologists.

593
00:38:47,398 --> 00:38:51,732
Talk radio psychology. Quick cash,
instant breakfast, minute rice.

594
00:38:51,802 --> 00:38:54,737
The only thing that's getting
slower are traffic and service.

595
00:38:54,805 --> 00:38:57,239
Who's your favorite
talk radio personality?

596
00:38:57,308 --> 00:39:00,709
Dr. Shirlee!

597
00:39:00,778 --> 00:39:03,076
This is not news, in case
anybody's interested.

598
00:39:03,147 --> 00:39:06,116
- You listen to talk radio?
- Only Dr. Shirlee.

599
00:39:06,183 --> 00:39:09,482
The hottest new personality
in Chicago radio is forthright...

600
00:39:09,554 --> 00:39:11,488
she's funny.

601
00:39:11,556 --> 00:39:15,515
Able to solve problems in 30 seconds
and still leave time for commercials.

602
00:39:15,593 --> 00:39:19,256
Hey, pal, you wanna bag that?
I like Dr. Shirlee.

603
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:23,130
Okay, fine. Who the hell
is Dr. Shirlee anyway?

604
00:39:24,702 --> 00:39:26,363
What's cooking with her?

605
00:39:26,437 --> 00:39:30,897
Although at this time Dr. Shirlee has
refused all requests for an interview...

606
00:39:30,975 --> 00:39:35,878
we do have here in our studio W-N-D-Y
program director Alan Riegert.

607
00:39:35,947 --> 00:39:38,541
Alan, who is Dr. Shirlee?

608
00:39:38,616 --> 00:39:40,584
Who is Dr. Shirlee?

609
00:39:40,651 --> 00:39:44,246
Dr. Shirlee is, and I don't think
it's an exaggeration...

610
00:39:44,322 --> 00:39:49,658
the best thing that's happened to
Chicago since deep-dish pizza.

611
00:39:49,727 --> 00:39:52,821
I think of her as my gift.

612
00:39:52,897 --> 00:39:56,890
I think of her as
my gift to Chicago...

613
00:39:56,968 --> 00:40:00,131
which is the city I love.

614
00:40:00,204 --> 00:40:03,469
Milo, there's a story here.
I know her personally.

615
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:07,739
- She doesn't know I'm a reporter.
- Doesn't sound like much.

616
00:40:07,812 --> 00:40:10,440
One day she's risking
her neck for 20 bucks...

617
00:40:10,514 --> 00:40:13,574
and the next, she's Chicago's
answer to Dr.Joyce Brothers.

618
00:40:13,651 --> 00:40:16,586
- It smells.
- You're wasting your time.

619
00:40:17,655 --> 00:40:20,055
Don't count on it.

620
00:40:46,183 --> 00:40:49,846
Why are they holding
a cocktail party at the aquarium?

621
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,152
Rich people like to dress up
and be seen in strange places.

622
00:40:54,225 --> 00:40:57,786
I feel like a kid dressed up
in my mama's clothes.

623
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:03,858
- I really don't feel like I belong here at all.
- Ten minutes.

624
00:41:03,934 --> 00:41:06,869
Shake a hand, have a drink,
save a whale.

625
00:41:06,937 --> 00:41:09,201
I'll be with you every second.

626
00:41:16,113 --> 00:41:19,879
Look at you.
Look at you!

627
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:22,544
I can't get over
the transformation.

628
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:26,716
You look like a million bucks.

629
00:41:26,791 --> 00:41:29,555
You make me very proud
of myself tonight.

630
00:41:29,627 --> 00:41:31,754
You're my discovery.

631
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:34,730
Alan, I am not the atom.

632
00:41:36,133 --> 00:41:38,567
- How much?
- It's gratis.

633
00:41:38,636 --> 00:41:41,696
I didn't ask what it was.
I asked how much.

634
00:41:41,772 --> 00:41:43,706
It's complimentary.

635
00:41:43,774 --> 00:41:46,902
And it's on the house,
without charge, free.

636
00:41:46,977 --> 00:41:50,071
No kidding?
Well, thank you.

637
00:41:52,116 --> 00:41:54,516
If you don't know
what something means...

638
00:41:54,585 --> 00:41:57,315
pretend you do and follow my lead.

639
00:41:57,388 --> 00:42:00,482
You're supposed to be
a college graduate.

640
00:42:06,897 --> 00:42:08,831
Excuse me.

641
00:42:10,901 --> 00:42:14,393
- Jack Russell, press.
- Invitation?

642
00:42:14,472 --> 00:42:18,670
- Our society columnist is covering the shindig.
- Mr. Sindell is already here.

643
00:42:18,743 --> 00:42:21,473
His wife went into labor.
I'm relieving him.

644
00:42:21,545 --> 00:42:23,137
His wife is with him.

645
00:42:23,214 --> 00:42:25,808
His wife is hyperventilating
in the back of a station wagon.

646
00:42:25,883 --> 00:42:28,613
An attractive temp from
the typing pool is with him.

647
00:42:28,686 --> 00:42:33,453
- If you'd like to break the news...
- No, please go in.

648
00:42:33,524 --> 00:42:34,923
Thank you.

649
00:42:41,965 --> 00:42:45,731
- Thinkin' of jumpin' in?
- Not unless you push me.

650
00:42:45,802 --> 00:42:49,738
So this is where you hang out when
you're not dangling from bridges.

651
00:42:49,806 --> 00:42:51,967
Doesn't seem like
your kind of party.

652
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:55,205
I don't want to know what
you think my kind of party is.

653
00:42:55,278 --> 00:42:57,212
Not the stuffed-shirt brigade.

654
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,407
I don't know about you,
but I'm bored.

655
00:42:59,482 --> 00:43:02,781
If you hate being here, why don't
you go somewhere you'd rather be?

656
00:43:02,852 --> 00:43:06,447
I'd rather be with Janice, but thanks
to you, Janice isn't around anymore.

657
00:43:06,523 --> 00:43:10,550
I want you to know I feel
bad about what happened.

658
00:43:10,627 --> 00:43:13,755
No, don't.
You had me pegged right.

659
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:16,264
My record relationship is 17 weeks.

660
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:19,700
When you consider it takes longer than
that to grow a good-looking lawn...

661
00:43:19,769 --> 00:43:21,737
it isn't much of a record.

662
00:43:21,805 --> 00:43:26,037
- But you keep doing the same thing
over and over. - I guess so.

663
00:43:26,109 --> 00:43:28,543
If a guy keeps wrecking
his car every six months...

664
00:43:28,611 --> 00:43:32,741
you'd begin to wonder about
his driving, wouldn't you?

665
00:43:32,816 --> 00:43:36,946
You're one of those guys that always
has to hold a part of himself back...

666
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,547
always keeping that one cookie
in the cookie jar.

667
00:43:40,623 --> 00:43:42,818
Would you like
a little free advice?

668
00:43:42,892 --> 00:43:45,326
It's like you're allergic
to cornflakes...

669
00:43:45,395 --> 00:43:49,331
so you start to buy stuff,
like a can of peas.

670
00:43:49,399 --> 00:43:52,334
You open the can and
inside... cornflakes.

671
00:43:52,402 --> 00:43:55,428
So you pick a TV dinner and...

672
00:43:55,505 --> 00:43:57,166
cornflakes.

673
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,764
What does that mean?

674
00:43:58,842 --> 00:44:02,505
The girls you go out with,
outside they're all different packages.

675
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:04,012
Inside...

676
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,243
Cornflakes.

677
00:44:07,317 --> 00:44:09,251
So...

678
00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:12,550
- so what do I do?
- Over here.

679
00:44:12,622 --> 00:44:17,184
I have to get out of here.
It was nice to see you again.

680
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,228
Hey, wait a minute!

681
00:44:21,698 --> 00:44:23,632
Hey, wait a minute.

682
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,932
You tell me my life is cornflakes and
cookies, and then you walk away?

683
00:44:28,004 --> 00:44:30,529
- Who are you?
- I'm Dr. Shirlee.

684
00:44:30,607 --> 00:44:33,633
You're a doctor?
What kind of doctor?

685
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:36,178
I'm a doctor of the heart.

686
00:44:36,246 --> 00:44:38,806
Dr. Shirlee.
You're the radio shrink.

687
00:44:38,882 --> 00:44:43,251
I had no idea Janice was
getting advice from a pro.

688
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:46,584
Dr. Shirlee, wow.
So...

689
00:44:46,656 --> 00:44:48,590
Um, thanks.

690
00:44:48,658 --> 00:44:51,684
So what do I do?

691
00:44:51,761 --> 00:44:55,094
Maybe you should try datin'
a different kind of woman...

692
00:44:55,165 --> 00:44:59,067
someone whose insides look
better than their outsides.

693
00:44:59,135 --> 00:45:01,968
Someone whose name begins with
"S" and ends with "E"?

694
00:45:02,038 --> 00:45:05,906
- If you know someone named Sylvie.
- No.

695
00:45:05,975 --> 00:45:08,944
- I know a guy named Shane.
- Ask him out.

696
00:45:09,012 --> 00:45:11,503
I'd rather ask you out.
Friday night.

697
00:45:11,581 --> 00:45:13,913
- It's a date.
- It is?

698
00:45:29,866 --> 00:45:32,300
Excuse me. Moritz, hi.

699
00:45:32,368 --> 00:45:34,393
Nice to see you, Jack.

700
00:45:34,471 --> 00:45:39,602
I'll do the best I can, but it's
gonna be a half-hour wait.

701
00:45:39,676 --> 00:45:43,476
- Do you think maybe...
- Dr. Shirlee. Well, well, well.

702
00:45:43,546 --> 00:45:45,980
We're honored to have you here.

703
00:45:46,049 --> 00:45:49,212
We have a beautiful table
for you, right this way.

704
00:45:53,022 --> 00:45:55,047
Medium rare and very well done.

705
00:45:55,124 --> 00:45:57,058
Thank you.

706
00:45:57,126 --> 00:46:00,357
- So you're not from Chicago?
- No, I'm not from Chicago.

707
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:02,898
Compliments of the house.

708
00:46:02,966 --> 00:46:06,561
- Is it gratis tonight?
- It is for you, Dr. Shirlee.

709
00:46:06,636 --> 00:46:09,104
Just for me?
How come?

710
00:46:09,172 --> 00:46:11,732
Well, because...

711
00:46:11,808 --> 00:46:13,969
Because you're Dr. Shirlee.

712
00:46:14,043 --> 00:46:17,444
That's real nice,
but it doesn't seem fair...

713
00:46:17,514 --> 00:46:20,449
for these other people who are
not Dr. Shirlee to be penalized.

714
00:46:20,517 --> 00:46:24,749
I'll pay for a bottle of this
champagne for every table.

715
00:46:24,821 --> 00:46:28,154
This is very expensive champagne.

716
00:46:28,224 --> 00:46:30,590
Money's meant to be spent, right?

717
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:35,154
What good's it gonna do in
the bottom of my panty drawer?

718
00:46:36,966 --> 00:46:39,434
It's $200 a bottle.

719
00:46:39,502 --> 00:46:42,938
Bad idea. Just forget it.

720
00:46:43,006 --> 00:46:45,839
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

721
00:46:45,909 --> 00:46:47,934
That's more than
I used to make in a week.

722
00:46:48,011 --> 00:46:51,503
- I thought shrinks were rich.
- Are they?

723
00:46:51,581 --> 00:46:55,312
Not all of them,
at least not at first.

724
00:46:55,385 --> 00:46:57,876
Why would you keep
your money in a drawer?

725
00:46:57,954 --> 00:47:00,479
Aren't you afraid
somebody's gonna steal it?

726
00:47:00,557 --> 00:47:05,017
I figure it's safer in my room
than in a bank these days.

727
00:47:05,094 --> 00:47:07,619
If somebody's gonna steal it...

728
00:47:07,697 --> 00:47:10,097
I'd rather it goes to
somebody that needs it...

729
00:47:10,166 --> 00:47:12,964
than some vice-president
of a savings and loan.

730
00:47:14,904 --> 00:47:16,872
What?

731
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:19,966
I just... love the way
you look at things.

732
00:47:20,043 --> 00:47:22,375
You're really interested
in me, aren't you?

733
00:47:22,445 --> 00:47:24,572
- Yes, I am.
- That's great.

734
00:47:24,647 --> 00:47:27,878
Most men just want
to talk about themselves.

735
00:47:27,951 --> 00:47:31,819
I want to know everything.
How did you lose your virginity?

736
00:47:35,592 --> 00:47:39,688
You don't want to start with "Where
you from, how long you been in town"?

737
00:47:39,762 --> 00:47:44,222
If you want. Where you from?
How long you been in town?

738
00:47:46,402 --> 00:47:50,270
- Under the bleachers.
- You're from under the bleachers?

739
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:53,434
No, that's where
I lost my virginity.

740
00:47:53,509 --> 00:47:57,377
Our high school had just
lost the state championship...

741
00:47:57,447 --> 00:48:01,474
and my boyfriend,
he was the tight end...

742
00:48:01,551 --> 00:48:04,952
and it was the only way
I could make him feel better.

743
00:48:06,889 --> 00:48:09,289
Who did you lose it to?

744
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:12,055
- My virginity?
- The state championship.

745
00:48:12,128 --> 00:48:15,757
To the Lamont Lions.

746
00:48:15,832 --> 00:48:19,791
How about you?
How'd you lose yours?

747
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:22,929
How's my star?

748
00:48:23,006 --> 00:48:25,167
I thought I saw you
sitting over here.

749
00:48:25,241 --> 00:48:27,505
I'm not interrupting
anything, am I?

750
00:48:27,577 --> 00:48:31,138
Alan, this is my friend Jack.
Jack, this is Alan, my boss.

751
00:48:31,214 --> 00:48:33,876
I don't think of myself
as just your boss.

752
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:36,919
I prefer to think of myself
as a friend and mentor.

753
00:48:36,986 --> 00:48:39,079
I discovered Shirlee.

754
00:48:39,155 --> 00:48:41,089
You make her sound like penicillin.

755
00:48:41,157 --> 00:48:43,785
Funny guy.

756
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:46,454
Zim Zimmerman's sitting over there.

757
00:48:46,529 --> 00:48:48,690
I'm gonna get you on his show.

758
00:48:48,765 --> 00:48:51,461
Come over and win
a few points for us.

759
00:48:51,534 --> 00:48:53,968
I thought I wasn't supposed
to give interviews.

760
00:48:54,037 --> 00:48:57,234
- Yeah, I thought she wasn't supposed
to give interviews. - How do you know?

761
00:48:57,306 --> 00:49:01,072
I just heard her say so.

762
00:49:01,144 --> 00:49:03,374
Excuse us.

763
00:49:03,446 --> 00:49:07,644
Listen, I told Zim
you'd be a great guest.

764
00:49:07,717 --> 00:49:10,777
I sort of went out on
a limb for you on this.

765
00:49:10,853 --> 00:49:14,482
Don't saw it out from
underneath me please.

766
00:49:27,302 --> 00:49:29,896
Well, this is where I live.

767
00:49:29,972 --> 00:49:34,306
You are full of surprises.

768
00:49:34,376 --> 00:49:38,073
- I had a great time.
- So did I.

769
00:49:38,147 --> 00:49:40,672
In fact, I'm having
way too much fun.

770
00:49:40,749 --> 00:49:43,217
What's wrong with that?
It's good, isn't it?

771
00:49:43,285 --> 00:49:45,753
Not for me, Jack.

772
00:49:45,821 --> 00:49:48,688
I have a bad track record with men.

773
00:49:48,757 --> 00:49:52,284
I find men that want to
change me, hurt me, use me...

774
00:49:52,361 --> 00:49:54,795
never just love me.

775
00:49:57,032 --> 00:50:01,696
But what the heck. Records
are made to be broken, right?

776
00:50:19,555 --> 00:50:21,147
We're ready, Dr. Kenyon.

777
00:50:21,223 --> 00:50:24,386
God.
Okay, here we go.

778
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,428
Now remember...

779
00:50:26,495 --> 00:50:29,191
undergraduate work,
University of Georgia.

780
00:50:29,264 --> 00:50:31,391
Graduate studies,
you went to Stanford.

781
00:50:31,467 --> 00:50:34,664
- You were tops in your class.
- I am not sayin' all that.

782
00:50:34,736 --> 00:50:36,727
I'm not gonna lie.

783
00:50:36,805 --> 00:50:39,638
You want to say you're
qualified to hand out advice...

784
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:43,144
based on being a three-time
loser dance instructor...

785
00:50:43,212 --> 00:50:46,545
who's never even
been near a college?

786
00:50:46,615 --> 00:50:49,049
Okay, you're nervous.
I see that now.

787
00:50:49,117 --> 00:50:51,517
I went over all
the questions with him.

788
00:50:51,587 --> 00:50:55,683
The only way to get in trouble is if you
deviate from the responses I've given you...

789
00:50:55,757 --> 00:50:59,716
or he puts down his clipboard, which means
he'll ask you something we didn't discuss.

790
00:50:59,795 --> 00:51:02,195
But he assured me
he's not gonna do that.

791
00:51:02,264 --> 00:51:04,755
Which leads me to
the following, Dr. Shirlee.

792
00:51:04,833 --> 00:51:06,926
You're aware of the furor...

793
00:51:07,002 --> 00:51:09,197
You bastard!
You lyin' bastard!

794
00:51:09,271 --> 00:51:13,264
- He said he wasn't gonna do that!
- We're working here!

795
00:51:13,342 --> 00:51:16,038
What do you mean?

796
00:51:16,111 --> 00:51:18,978
Specifically, how it
denigrates a profession...

797
00:51:19,047 --> 00:51:21,777
exploits it for its
commercial ends.

798
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:24,045
Is that what you think?

799
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:25,984
Have you listened to my program?

800
00:51:26,054 --> 00:51:30,150
Of course I have, but we're not
discussing my opinions here.

801
00:51:30,225 --> 00:51:32,989
Why not?
It's your show.

802
00:51:33,061 --> 00:51:35,495
Let's be straight.

803
00:51:35,564 --> 00:51:37,930
The people you deal with
are total strangers.

804
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,026
You have little or no
knowledge of their history...

805
00:51:41,103 --> 00:51:44,266
and yet you try and solve their
problems in less than five minutes.

806
00:51:44,339 --> 00:51:48,799
Don't you worry that to give advice
with so little information...

807
00:51:48,877 --> 00:51:51,107
can have serious repercussions?

808
00:51:51,179 --> 00:51:53,409
People just give me a holler.

809
00:51:53,482 --> 00:51:56,417
I tell 'em what I think
and hope it helps.

810
00:51:56,485 --> 00:51:59,818
I don't know all the answers.
Do you, Zim?

811
00:51:59,888 --> 00:52:01,515
Don't you think you can hurt?

812
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:04,184
Don't you worry that
you may give advice...

813
00:52:04,259 --> 00:52:06,250
without enough knowledge
of the person...

814
00:52:06,328 --> 00:52:09,695
I just tell the truth as I see it.

815
00:52:09,765 --> 00:52:12,893
To my knowledge, the truth
has never caused any damage.

816
00:52:12,968 --> 00:52:15,163
Pain sometimes, but not damage.

817
00:52:15,237 --> 00:52:17,535
Very nice.

818
00:52:17,606 --> 00:52:19,540
Very nice.

819
00:52:19,608 --> 00:52:22,805
- Shut him up or get him out of here.
- Sorry.

820
00:52:26,982 --> 00:52:29,644
Let's welcome my special guest...

821
00:52:29,718 --> 00:52:33,552
renowned radio psychiatrist
Dr. David Erdman.

822
00:52:35,857 --> 00:52:38,758
Welcome, Dr. Erdman.

823
00:52:38,827 --> 00:52:41,227
Shit! Shit!

824
00:52:41,296 --> 00:52:43,355
I'm glad to have a second opinion.

825
00:52:45,434 --> 00:52:47,493
Let's start with...

826
00:52:47,569 --> 00:52:51,335
what are you looking for
in a caller, Dr. Erdman?

827
00:52:51,406 --> 00:52:55,433
I like a caller that fits my listeners'
demographic profile.

828
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:58,172
I like healthy callers
with healthy problems.

829
00:52:58,246 --> 00:53:01,044
If their questions happen to
tie in with a tape I'm promoting...

830
00:53:01,116 --> 00:53:02,981
so much the better.

831
00:53:03,051 --> 00:53:05,713
No, seriously.

832
00:53:05,787 --> 00:53:08,585
I'm here to help anyone
in my listening audience...

833
00:53:08,657 --> 00:53:12,184
who wants to come to a deeper
understanding of themselves.

834
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,888
- Dr. Shirlee.
- What am I looking for in a caller?

835
00:53:14,963 --> 00:53:19,764
- I'm looking for someone that needs help.
- And?

836
00:53:19,835 --> 00:53:22,963
And they have to eat
Froot Loops for breakfast.

837
00:53:23,038 --> 00:53:26,633
And what? Someone with
a problem. Isn't that enough?

838
00:53:29,177 --> 00:53:33,079
Let's proceed with what I feel is the
most interesting part of the program.

839
00:53:34,249 --> 00:53:36,240
We have a caller who has a problem.

840
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:39,617
We're gonna ask each of our doctors
to respond to that problem...

841
00:53:39,688 --> 00:53:41,952
in order to let you see...

842
00:53:42,024 --> 00:53:44,288
the different approaches
to radio psychology.

843
00:53:46,595 --> 00:53:48,563
Hi, you're on the air.

844
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:51,064
- Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear, Joan.

845
00:53:51,133 --> 00:53:55,069
This is Joan. She's 48.
She has a marital problem.

846
00:53:55,137 --> 00:53:57,298
Please doctors,
in the interest of brevity...

847
00:53:57,372 --> 00:53:59,567
keep your responses
to Joan's problem...

848
00:53:59,641 --> 00:54:02,667
down to a minute.
Go ahead, Joan.

849
00:54:02,744 --> 00:54:05,975
My husband's been
having an affair for a year...

850
00:54:06,048 --> 00:54:09,142
and I found out about it
about six months ago.

851
00:54:09,217 --> 00:54:11,879
I asked him to stop, but he won't.

852
00:54:11,953 --> 00:54:14,080
I wrote a letter to
the woman he's seeing...

853
00:54:14,156 --> 00:54:17,148
and asked her not to see him,
but she showed it to him.

854
00:54:17,225 --> 00:54:20,456
Hey, will you get outta there?
What is he doing?

855
00:54:20,529 --> 00:54:25,489
I'm so filled with anger toward him,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

856
00:54:25,567 --> 00:54:27,660
- Dr. Erdman.
- Hold that shot.

857
00:54:27,736 --> 00:54:32,196
- Joan, do you want a divorce?
- No.

858
00:54:32,274 --> 00:54:35,710
Then I suggest that
you let sleeping dogs lie.

859
00:54:35,777 --> 00:54:38,211
- What!
- You'll have your turn.

860
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,545
Joan, you do not hate your husband
for doing this. You hate yourself.

861
00:54:41,616 --> 00:54:43,846
Give me one.

862
00:54:43,919 --> 00:54:46,217
If you felt better
about yourself...

863
00:54:46,288 --> 00:54:49,257
maybe your husband
would want to be with you.

864
00:54:49,324 --> 00:54:51,656
It's her fault
her husband's cheatin'?

865
00:54:51,727 --> 00:54:54,059
I'm simply suggesting
that she look to herself.

866
00:54:54,129 --> 00:54:56,256
Maybe she's too demanding in bed.

867
00:54:56,331 --> 00:54:58,925
You talk to your callers like that?

868
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,199
You should be disbarred or derailed
or whatever they do to doctors.

869
00:55:04,272 --> 00:55:05,864
Derailed?

870
00:55:05,941 --> 00:55:08,876
Where did you receive
your training, Doctor?

871
00:55:08,944 --> 00:55:12,471
- Where did I receive my training?
- Yes.

872
00:55:12,547 --> 00:55:16,881
I'm a graduate of Harvard, postgraduate
studies at the Sorbonne. Where did you train?

873
00:55:16,952 --> 00:55:19,682
Where did I train?
I trained at Screw U.

874
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:26,150
You know who came up with the
expression "Let sleeping dogs lie"?

875
00:55:26,228 --> 00:55:27,661
A dog.

876
00:55:29,531 --> 00:55:32,523
And, Joan, honey, you are
not going to change him.

877
00:55:32,601 --> 00:55:34,865
You gotta live with it or end it.

878
00:55:34,936 --> 00:55:39,305
Tinkle or get off the potty. Either way,
you'll start to like yourself again.

879
00:55:40,942 --> 00:55:44,400
Yes, yes, yes!
Shirlee!

880
00:55:47,716 --> 00:55:50,708
We love you.!

881
00:55:50,786 --> 00:55:54,415
She was so good!
God!

882
00:55:54,489 --> 00:55:58,687
- You guys are great.!
- We'll be right back.

883
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,160
This show is fantastic.!

884
00:56:03,865 --> 00:56:07,130
This is great.

885
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:10,227
She blew both of those guys away.
When can I get the story?

886
00:56:10,304 --> 00:56:13,239
- So now you think it's a story.
- It's a story.

887
00:56:13,307 --> 00:56:16,401
- How much have you got on her?
- Almost enough.

888
00:56:16,477 --> 00:56:18,809
Get on it.

889
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,973
Nail her and fast?

890
00:56:26,587 --> 00:56:29,147
Shirlee, what's the matter?
Where you going?

891
00:56:29,223 --> 00:56:32,681
Let's go back inside.
We didn't say good night to Zim.

892
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,921
Alan, I'm tired.
I want to go.

893
00:56:34,996 --> 00:56:36,930
- You're the pink Mercedes.
- No, I'm not.

894
00:56:36,998 --> 00:56:39,398
No, I'm Shirlee Kenyon.
I drive a pink Mercedes.

895
00:56:43,771 --> 00:56:46,262
- I'm depressed.
- Come on!

896
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,865
What are you talking about?
You should be on cloud nine.

897
00:56:48,943 --> 00:56:50,877
You just buried
those two clowns in there.

898
00:56:50,945 --> 00:56:53,812
That's great, but all
this "doctor" stuff...

899
00:56:53,881 --> 00:56:57,977
and what Zim said about
what if somethin' happened?

900
00:56:58,052 --> 00:57:01,146
Let's face it.
I'm not trained.

901
00:57:01,222 --> 00:57:04,316
Maybe Dr. Erdman is a jerk...

902
00:57:04,392 --> 00:57:07,520
- but at least he's been to school.
- Dr. Erdman!

903
00:57:07,595 --> 00:57:10,928
Dr. Erdman knows about
as much as you do.

904
00:57:10,998 --> 00:57:15,230
I oughta know. He was my shrink
for five years and look how sick I am!

905
00:57:15,303 --> 00:57:17,999
Come on, Shirlee, lighten up!

906
00:57:18,072 --> 00:57:20,199
I'm not a doctor.

907
00:57:20,274 --> 00:57:23,038
And I'm certainly
not my Mercedes...

908
00:57:23,111 --> 00:57:25,545
so who am I?

909
00:57:33,321 --> 00:57:35,721
I'm a Cadillac.

910
00:57:37,825 --> 00:57:41,761
Dr. Shirlee, we have Sean on the line.
He's a sober alcoholic.

911
00:57:41,829 --> 00:57:44,627
Shirlee, thanks for taking my call.

912
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:47,793
I've been sober for two years
and my wife is an alcoholic.

913
00:57:47,869 --> 00:57:50,064
I don't know what to do.

914
00:57:50,138 --> 00:57:53,301
If I stay around her I could drink
again and she doesn't want to quit.

915
00:57:53,374 --> 00:57:56,104
You got kids, Sean, or
is it just the two of you?

916
00:57:56,177 --> 00:57:58,509
It's just us.

917
00:57:58,579 --> 00:58:02,811
In that case, tell her you can't
be with her if she's drinkin'.

918
00:58:02,884 --> 00:58:05,216
If she loves you enough,
she'll try to quit.

919
00:58:05,286 --> 00:58:09,017
If she doesn't, you have to love
yourself enough to walk away.

920
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:11,115
Like my daddy always said...

921
00:58:11,192 --> 00:58:13,319
a bird and a fish
can fall in love...

922
00:58:13,394 --> 00:58:15,794
but where do they make a home?

923
00:58:15,863 --> 00:58:17,888
I saw that!

924
00:58:17,965 --> 00:58:21,025
My helper is makin' faces
at my choice of words.

925
00:58:21,102 --> 00:58:23,969
But what I'm sayin' is true.
Sometimes the only way...

926
00:58:24,038 --> 00:58:28,065
you can get somebody to change
their bad habits is to leave 'em.

927
00:58:28,142 --> 00:58:31,600
And if they don't, at least
one of you's gotten out alive.

928
00:58:36,484 --> 00:58:38,577
What's cookin', Gene?

929
00:58:38,653 --> 00:58:41,247
You made quite an impression
last night, Shirlee...

930
00:58:41,322 --> 00:58:43,586
and not just on Zim Zimmerman.

931
00:58:43,658 --> 00:58:46,718
Mr. Perlman, sometimes
my mouth just runs off...

932
00:58:46,794 --> 00:58:48,989
without checkin'
with my brain first.

933
00:58:49,063 --> 00:58:53,625
- I didn't mean to offend him.
- No!

934
00:58:53,701 --> 00:58:56,431
No, Shirlee.
A good impression.

935
00:58:56,504 --> 00:58:58,404
The network called this morning.

936
00:58:58,472 --> 00:59:00,463
They want to take you national.

937
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:03,908
Promotional tours,
ad campaigns, the works!

938
00:59:03,978 --> 00:59:07,414
Listeners calling Dr. Shirlee
from coast-to-coast.

939
00:59:07,481 --> 00:59:09,881
- How many people's that?
- Millions!

940
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:13,045
- Millions?
- You've got work, Alan.

941
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,850
I want a photo layout.
"People" magazine.

942
00:59:15,923 --> 00:59:18,585
"Chicago's favorite
doctor at home."

943
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:21,719
At home?
I don't think...

944
00:59:21,796 --> 00:59:24,390
Don't think, Alan.
Do it! Do it!

945
00:59:24,465 --> 00:59:27,059
Spotlight's on it's shining bright

946
00:59:27,134 --> 00:59:29,864
And I like standing in it

947
00:59:29,937 --> 00:59:33,168
It's only superficial light

948
00:59:33,241 --> 00:59:35,607
We'll take it just the way it is.

949
00:59:35,676 --> 00:59:38,941
- Alan, I don't need a place this fancy.
- Really?

950
00:59:39,013 --> 00:59:41,641
Maybe we should get Avedon
to do a photo shoot of you...

951
00:59:41,716 --> 00:59:45,015
at the Hotel Roosevelt, at home.

952
00:59:45,086 --> 00:59:48,954
I want to claim as mine

953
00:59:49,023 --> 00:59:55,622
Fancy clothes, a magic coach
and happy ever after

954
00:59:55,696 --> 00:59:57,891
- I Ike something from a storybook
- Get over there.

955
00:59:57,965 --> 01:00:00,798
- A Cinderella chapter
- She's coming over.

956
01:00:00,868 --> 01:00:03,530
But when the clock strikes midnight

957
01:00:03,604 --> 01:00:06,767
And I lie awake in bed

958
01:00:06,841 --> 01:00:09,708
These lines the teacher told me

959
01:00:09,777 --> 01:00:13,406
Keep running through my head

960
01:00:13,481 --> 01:00:16,848
You gotta walk
the straight and narrow

961
01:00:16,918 --> 01:00:20,081
And to thine own self be true

962
01:00:20,154 --> 01:00:22,679
You gotta aim straight as an arrow

963
01:00:22,757 --> 01:00:26,659
All eyes are upon you

964
01:00:26,727 --> 01:00:32,495
But sometimes it feels so good
that I can almost justify

965
01:00:32,566 --> 01:00:35,433
Living a l-l-lie

966
01:00:35,503 --> 01:00:38,336
Living a lie

967
01:00:38,406 --> 01:00:42,308
Living a l-l-lie

968
01:00:44,378 --> 01:00:47,006
Living a lie

969
01:00:56,857 --> 01:01:00,623
Shirlee Kenyon? Hey, Steve,
do we know a Shirlee Kenyon?

970
01:01:00,695 --> 01:01:04,187
Yeah. Who wants to know?

971
01:01:04,265 --> 01:01:06,460
This guy down here.

972
01:01:06,534 --> 01:01:08,502
How well do you know her?

973
01:01:08,569 --> 01:01:12,130
I know her well.
I know her very, very well.

974
01:01:12,206 --> 01:01:15,607
How did you meet her?

975
01:01:17,211 --> 01:01:19,577
How did I meet who?

976
01:01:21,716 --> 01:01:23,684
Shirlee Kenyon.

977
01:01:26,253 --> 01:01:29,313
Well, my best friend
married her three times.

978
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:34,054
When he got done marrying her,
she moved in with me...

979
01:01:34,128 --> 01:01:38,155
and I didn't even
have to marry her once.

980
01:01:38,232 --> 01:01:41,497
- She married the same guy three times.
- Yeah.

981
01:01:41,569 --> 01:01:46,063
- Why are you asking all these questions?
- Credit check.

982
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:49,303
What'd you say your name was?

983
01:01:50,411 --> 01:01:52,641
- Mack.
- Listen, Mack.

984
01:01:57,351 --> 01:01:59,911
Do you give credit...

985
01:01:59,987 --> 01:02:03,388
to people who steal
other people's bowling bags?

986
01:02:09,296 --> 01:02:12,493
And I sacrificed my honor

987
01:02:12,566 --> 01:02:15,034
My values and my pride

988
01:02:15,102 --> 01:02:19,402
Living a l-l-lie

989
01:02:22,643 --> 01:02:26,010
You don't by any chance
dance, do you?

990
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:29,641
Living a lie, living a lie

991
01:02:29,717 --> 01:02:33,483
Living a lie

992
01:02:33,554 --> 01:02:36,785
Watch what you're doin', Jack.

993
01:02:36,857 --> 01:02:40,418
Just look at me and stop
thinkin' about your feet.

994
01:02:40,494 --> 01:02:42,928
- Where'd you learn all this?
- I used to teach.

995
01:02:42,997 --> 01:02:45,261
- When?
- A long time ago.

996
01:02:45,332 --> 01:02:47,527
- Where was that?
- What?

997
01:02:47,601 --> 01:02:50,399
- Where?
- It was before I became a doctor.

998
01:02:50,471 --> 01:02:53,963
Loosen up, Jack. Just relax.

999
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:57,067
- Did I ever tell you about my novel?
- No! Did you write a novel?

1000
01:02:57,144 --> 01:02:59,078
I had an idea for a novel.

1001
01:02:59,146 --> 01:03:01,842
I started talking about this book
I was gonna write.

1002
01:03:01,916 --> 01:03:06,478
The guys at the office would say,
"Jack, you started that book yet?"

1003
01:03:06,554 --> 01:03:10,957
One day I got so sick of
saying "no," I said "yes."

1004
01:03:11,025 --> 01:03:15,052
Then it was, "Jack, how's the book
coming?" "It's coming along."

1005
01:03:15,129 --> 01:03:19,156
Then, "Have you finished
that book yet?"

1006
01:03:19,233 --> 01:03:22,930
One day I just said,
"Yes, it's finished."

1007
01:03:23,003 --> 01:03:26,234
Funny thing was,
I hadn't started it yet.

1008
01:03:26,307 --> 01:03:30,641
- I didn't mean to lie. It just happened.
- What are you tryin' to do?

1009
01:03:30,711 --> 01:03:33,544
What are you tryin' to do?

1010
01:03:33,614 --> 01:03:37,345
The fox-trot, rock step? What?

1011
01:03:37,418 --> 01:03:41,286
- I'm just trying to dance.
- Well, just watch me!

1012
01:03:43,657 --> 01:03:46,285
Rock step, step.
Rock step, step.

1013
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,590
Move those hips.
Move those hips!

1014
01:03:48,662 --> 01:03:52,860
Looking good.
Ha!

1015
01:03:57,338 --> 01:04:00,307
I guess nothing like that
ever happened to you?

1016
01:04:00,374 --> 01:04:05,277
- Like happened to me with the book?
- Jack, shut up and dance.

1017
01:04:36,177 --> 01:04:39,271
Outside.! Ball three.

1018
01:04:39,346 --> 01:04:40,904
Nice shot.

1019
01:04:40,981 --> 01:04:44,610
The coach is walking to the mound,
not looking good for the doctor.

1020
01:04:44,685 --> 01:04:47,347
It may be a long trip
back to the bullpen.

1021
01:04:47,421 --> 01:04:51,517
- Put your index finger here.
Thumb on the outside. - Okay.

1022
01:04:51,592 --> 01:04:54,755
She's winding up.
The form is looking good.

1023
01:04:57,331 --> 01:05:00,858
A little high and outside again.
Try again.

1024
01:05:03,737 --> 01:05:07,571
If you ever do write that novel,
what's it gonna be about?

1025
01:05:07,641 --> 01:05:10,235
- That was truly pitiful.
- Why, thank you.

1026
01:05:10,311 --> 01:05:14,645
I don't know. Despair? Greed?
Corruption? All my favorite things.

1027
01:05:14,715 --> 01:05:18,879
Why don't you write about somethin' you
love instead of something you hate?

1028
01:05:18,953 --> 01:05:20,887
- Like what?
- Like baseball.

1029
01:05:20,955 --> 01:05:23,685
Write a book about baseball.

1030
01:05:23,757 --> 01:05:26,817
Just what the world needs,
another baseball novel.

1031
01:05:26,894 --> 01:05:30,591
Sure they do...
if it's great.

1032
01:05:30,664 --> 01:05:33,497
And I bet if you wrote it,
it would be.

1033
01:05:33,567 --> 01:05:36,661
I love when you talk sweet to me.

1034
01:05:36,737 --> 01:05:40,298
- You haven't even heard sweet yet.
- How long do I have to wait?

1035
01:05:40,374 --> 01:05:44,640
- We're gettin' closer.
- Hey, guys?

1036
01:05:44,712 --> 01:05:46,805
Oops. Game called
on account of cops.

1037
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,976
It's late... and
this ain't no ballpark.

1038
01:05:51,051 --> 01:05:53,178
Can I see some I.D. please?

1039
01:05:53,254 --> 01:05:55,950
- We'll take a rain check, Jack.
- I'll pray for rain.

1040
01:05:56,023 --> 01:05:58,685
- I.D.!
- Thank you, Officer...

1041
01:05:58,759 --> 01:06:02,422
for keeping Chicago safe
from flying lemons.

1042
01:06:02,496 --> 01:06:03,364
Whoop.

1043
01:06:03,364 --> 01:06:04,314
Whoop.

1044
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:07,190
"Shirlee Kenyon."

1045
01:06:07,267 --> 01:06:09,235
Dr. Shirlee Kenyon?

1046
01:06:09,303 --> 01:06:12,329
It'll work out, Phil.
You call me.

1047
01:06:12,406 --> 01:06:14,567
I will. Thanks!

1048
01:06:14,641 --> 01:06:17,940
Okay. Good night.

1049
01:06:18,012 --> 01:06:20,446
Sorry. Phil's daughter, Carol...

1050
01:06:20,514 --> 01:06:24,541
- ran away twice in the last month.
- Good for her.

1051
01:06:31,625 --> 01:06:34,594
You wanna come up
and check out my carpet samples?

1052
01:06:35,662 --> 01:06:38,529
Is that a line?

1053
01:06:38,599 --> 01:06:41,693
Dusty rose, Christmas green,
or elephant gray?

1054
01:06:43,604 --> 01:06:45,162
Nah.!

1055
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:47,867
- We'll forget about the elephant gray.
- Great apartment.

1056
01:06:47,941 --> 01:06:49,841
Thanks.

1057
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:52,708
I was worried about takin' it,
paying all this rent and all.

1058
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:56,147
But Alan says
my job's pretty secure.

1059
01:06:56,216 --> 01:06:59,276
It really is great.
The money, the car, this apartment.

1060
01:06:59,353 --> 01:07:02,049
But if my audience
gets tired of me...

1061
01:07:02,122 --> 01:07:04,454
I don't think losin' it
would just kill me.

1062
01:07:06,527 --> 01:07:08,586
So...

1063
01:07:08,662 --> 01:07:12,098
what do we decide? The Dusty
rose or the Christmas green?

1064
01:07:25,779 --> 01:07:28,247
Carpet samples turn you on.

1065
01:07:28,315 --> 01:07:31,807
I tried everything else.

1066
01:07:38,225 --> 01:07:41,786
You probably think you just heard the doorbell.
Trust me, you're hallucinating.

1067
01:07:41,862 --> 01:07:45,889
See, most women, right after they kiss
me, tell me they hear a doorbell...

1068
01:07:45,966 --> 01:07:48,400
followed by
the faint scent of orchids.

1069
01:07:48,469 --> 01:07:52,405
- Do you smell the orchids yet?
- No.

1070
01:07:52,473 --> 01:07:55,965
Just the pungent aroma of bullshit.-

1071
01:07:56,043 --> 01:07:59,535
Wait, wait! No one with any class
shows up unannounced.

1072
01:07:59,613 --> 01:08:02,081
- Ignore it.
- What if it's "The Millionaire"?

1073
01:08:02,149 --> 01:08:04,743
Did you ever see that show
where Michael Anthony...

1074
01:08:04,818 --> 01:08:07,685
shows up with a million dollars
from John Beresford Tipton?

1075
01:08:07,754 --> 01:08:11,315
But there's a catch.
You have to answer the door.

1076
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:14,292
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Jack.

1077
01:08:14,361 --> 01:08:18,525
- You're a great kisser... but a
million dollars? - You got a point.

1078
01:08:18,599 --> 01:08:21,500
Stay puckered.

1079
01:08:21,568 --> 01:08:24,867
Coming, Mr. Anthony.

1080
01:08:27,074 --> 01:08:28,871
Hello, baby.

1081
01:08:28,942 --> 01:08:32,241
Surprised to see me?

1082
01:08:34,148 --> 01:08:38,676
Wow, you're doin' very well.

1083
01:08:38,752 --> 01:08:40,686
Very, very well.

1084
01:08:40,754 --> 01:08:42,722
Steve, what are you doin' here?

1085
01:08:42,789 --> 01:08:47,817
I heard you made out, so I thought
I'd come by and see for myself.

1086
01:08:47,895 --> 01:08:51,262
Went by that radio station
and told 'em I was...

1087
01:08:51,331 --> 01:08:55,597
your long-lost brother home from
the Navy just dying to surpr...

1088
01:08:55,669 --> 01:08:58,695
Who the hell is this?

1089
01:08:58,772 --> 01:09:01,536
- I'll leave you two alone.
- No, you don't.

1090
01:09:01,608 --> 01:09:04,406
- Jack, this is Steve. Steve, Jack.
- How you doin'?

1091
01:09:04,478 --> 01:09:08,608
- Don't I know you?
- No! No, I don't think so.

1092
01:09:08,682 --> 01:09:11,014
You never been to Arkansas?

1093
01:09:11,084 --> 01:09:15,020
- We better do this another time.
- Do what another time?

1094
01:09:15,088 --> 01:09:17,386
It's none of your business.

1095
01:09:20,294 --> 01:09:22,228
I don't like your attitude.

1096
01:09:22,296 --> 01:09:25,959
That's a big word for you,
attitude.

1097
01:09:26,033 --> 01:09:29,332
Why don't you just
give your mouth a rest?

1098
01:09:29,403 --> 01:09:32,099
Damn you, Steve.!

1099
01:09:32,172 --> 01:09:35,266
Want me to throw him out?
'Cause I'll do it..

1100
01:09:35,342 --> 01:09:38,106
- I don't like you.
- Really? Too bad.

1101
01:09:38,178 --> 01:09:42,046
- I was gonna ask if you want to spend
Thanksgiving together. - Steve, get out!

1102
01:09:42,115 --> 01:09:44,811
I don't know why you're here...

1103
01:09:44,885 --> 01:09:48,912
or what you think,
but you can forget it, it's over!

1104
01:09:48,989 --> 01:09:52,720
Well, maybe yes and maybe no.
But it'll keep.

1105
01:09:52,793 --> 01:09:54,818
I know you.

1106
01:09:54,895 --> 01:09:58,888
I can't put my finger on it,
but believe me, it'll come to me.

1107
01:09:58,966 --> 01:10:00,490
Tell Shirlee...

1108
01:10:00,567 --> 01:10:03,730
I like the Dusty rose.

1109
01:10:06,873 --> 01:10:09,273
Wait a minute.!

1110
01:10:09,343 --> 01:10:12,176
I do owe you something!

1111
01:10:21,221 --> 01:10:23,849
Head back, head back.

1112
01:10:23,924 --> 01:10:27,018
- I was gonna kick his ass.
- I know.

1113
01:10:27,094 --> 01:10:31,155
Except I'm really more
of a lover than a fighter.

1114
01:10:31,231 --> 01:10:34,826
I can see that.

1115
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:43,173
Now see?

1116
01:10:43,243 --> 01:10:46,440
- Maybe we better make it another time.
- Yeah, maybe.

1117
01:10:49,516 --> 01:10:53,350
On the other hand...

1118
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:56,878
We can... work around it.

1119
01:11:10,137 --> 01:11:13,300
- Want to come in?
- Before I do...

1120
01:11:13,373 --> 01:11:16,467
there's something
I should tell you.

1121
01:11:16,543 --> 01:11:18,340
You're gay?

1122
01:11:18,412 --> 01:11:20,346
No.

1123
01:11:21,948 --> 01:11:24,473
- Married?
- No.

1124
01:11:24,551 --> 01:11:26,883
Will it spoil the mood?

1125
01:11:26,953 --> 01:11:29,012
It might.

1126
01:11:29,089 --> 01:11:31,387
Will it keep?

1127
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,819
Yes.

1128
01:12:10,864 --> 01:12:16,097
- Holy moley.!
- Is that all you can say?

1129
01:12:16,169 --> 01:12:19,468
Ho-ly moley.!-

1130
01:12:27,681 --> 01:12:30,081
Holy moley!

1131
01:12:30,150 --> 01:12:32,846
Yeah. Yeah.

1132
01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:47,957
"If I died tomorrow,
I'd go with a smile.

1133
01:12:48,034 --> 01:12:51,094
Meet me at our
coffee shop at noon."

1134
01:12:52,973 --> 01:12:55,601
Couldn't wait 'til noon?

1135
01:12:58,845 --> 01:13:01,075
I just remembered
where I saw that guy.

1136
01:13:02,516 --> 01:13:04,507
I told him it'd come to me.

1137
01:13:04,584 --> 01:13:06,779
Milo?

1138
01:13:06,853 --> 01:13:09,378
Milo, you wanna see me?

1139
01:13:09,456 --> 01:13:13,415
We're putting the weekend edition
to bed. Where's my story?

1140
01:13:13,493 --> 01:13:16,462
- There is no story.
- What do you mean, there's no story?

1141
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:19,363
Okay, there is a story,
but I'm not writing it.

1142
01:13:19,432 --> 01:13:21,400
Are you going funny on me?

1143
01:13:21,468 --> 01:13:26,371
- Milo, I'm sorry. I just can't do it.
- You know what I think?

1144
01:13:26,439 --> 01:13:30,705
I think maybe you like this Dr. Shirlee
a little too much to tell the truth.

1145
01:13:30,777 --> 01:13:33,746
Is that it?
Let me tell you something.

1146
01:13:33,814 --> 01:13:37,716
A real reporter is somebody who maybe
cries when he writes the story...

1147
01:13:37,784 --> 01:13:41,618
but he writes the story because
the public deserves to know.

1148
01:13:41,688 --> 01:13:43,679
What? What do
they deserve to know?

1149
01:13:43,757 --> 01:13:46,248
Every stupid fact
that comes a reporter's way?

1150
01:13:46,326 --> 01:13:49,056
Maybe sometimes the thing
to do is keep your mouth shut.

1151
01:13:49,129 --> 01:13:52,792
Some facts don't matter to anyone except
the person you're telling them about.

1152
01:13:52,866 --> 01:13:54,993
Don't pull this on me.

1153
01:13:55,068 --> 01:13:57,901
What do you think?
I'm going to admire your backbone?

1154
01:13:57,971 --> 01:14:00,496
You think I'm gonna respect
you for standing up to me?

1155
01:14:00,574 --> 01:14:03,099
Let me tell you something.
I hate backbone!

1156
01:14:03,176 --> 01:14:05,906
I despise people
who stand up to me.

1157
01:14:05,979 --> 01:14:08,948
- Please, don't make me fire you.
- You won't have to fire me.

1158
01:14:09,015 --> 01:14:12,746
- Thanks. I'm glad.
- You won't have to fire me...

1159
01:14:13,854 --> 01:14:16,482
because I quit.

1160
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:21,155
Three's about done,
another fifteen minutes.

1161
01:14:25,632 --> 01:14:29,159
- Hey, hey!
- What were you doin' in Flat River?

1162
01:14:29,236 --> 01:14:33,070
- And why were you askin' questions about me?
- Flat River?

1163
01:14:33,139 --> 01:14:35,539
You talked to Steve.
He told me.

1164
01:14:35,609 --> 01:14:38,169
Give me a chance to explain.
Let's talk about it.

1165
01:14:38,245 --> 01:14:41,806
- All I want is an answer.
- It's not that simple.

1166
01:14:41,881 --> 01:14:45,612
- You're a reporter. You were
doin' a story on me. - No.

1167
01:14:45,685 --> 01:14:49,143
Yes... I was but I'm not.

1168
01:14:49,222 --> 01:14:52,089
That's why you wanted to spend
time with me? Be with me?

1169
01:14:52,158 --> 01:14:55,355
So you could get the dirt on me?
I thought you were different.

1170
01:14:55,428 --> 01:14:58,591
- I thought my luck had finally changed.
- Wait a minute, Shirl.

1171
01:14:58,665 --> 01:15:02,431
- You don't understand.
- You did a good job, Jack.

1172
01:15:02,502 --> 01:15:04,527
They say you shouldn't
take your work to bed.

1173
01:15:04,604 --> 01:15:09,007
- In this case, I guess they were wrong.
- Man!

1174
01:15:09,075 --> 01:15:10,508
Shirlee!

1175
01:15:10,577 --> 01:15:14,138
I didn't write the story, okay?
I quit my job over it.

1176
01:15:14,214 --> 01:15:17,081
- Why should I believe anything you say?
- It's the truth.

1177
01:15:17,150 --> 01:15:19,778
- Don't talk to me about the truth.
- Don't talk to you?

1178
01:15:19,853 --> 01:15:22,822
- Why? Because you are such an expert?
- You lied to me.

1179
01:15:22,889 --> 01:15:24,857
- You lied to the whole world.
- It's not the same.

1180
01:15:24,924 --> 01:15:27,859
I hate to burst your bubble...

1181
01:15:27,927 --> 01:15:31,522
- but of course it is the same.
- Good-bye, Jack.

1182
01:15:31,598 --> 01:15:35,125
- Now what are you gonna do?
- I never said I was too good to take a bus.

1183
01:15:35,201 --> 01:15:38,432
Okay, Shirlee,
it all started, yes...

1184
01:15:38,505 --> 01:15:40,973
because I wanted
to get a story on you.

1185
01:15:41,041 --> 01:15:43,942
Then I began to care and...

1186
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:47,502
Geez, Louise!
God, you can be so pigheaded!

1187
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:49,309
Look.

1188
01:15:49,382 --> 01:15:51,976
No! Shirlee!

1189
01:16:22,315 --> 01:16:26,081
Burning to know you

1190
01:16:26,152 --> 01:16:29,815
Burning to show you

1191
01:16:29,889 --> 01:16:36,789
I've felt this way from the start

1192
01:16:37,063 --> 01:16:40,157
Burning with passion

1193
01:16:40,233 --> 01:16:44,897
I thought it was lasting

1194
01:16:44,971 --> 01:16:50,705
Now it's burning a hole in my heart

1195
01:16:50,777 --> 01:16:55,476
Here's Dr. Shirlee arriving to her
very first coast-to-coast broadcast.

1196
01:16:55,548 --> 01:16:58,574
A small but enthusiastic group of fans
has been waiting patiently...

1197
01:16:58,651 --> 01:17:00,812
to see their favorite
talk-show host.

1198
01:17:00,887 --> 01:17:02,752
Now they're showing
their appreciation.

1199
01:17:02,822 --> 01:17:05,655
Let's try to get her over here.

1200
01:17:05,725 --> 01:17:08,785
You shouldn't have
told him to leave!

1201
01:17:08,862 --> 01:17:11,592
- Who are you?
- You shouldn't have told Sean to leave me.

1202
01:17:11,664 --> 01:17:13,359
Sean?

1203
01:17:13,433 --> 01:17:17,563
You destroy someone's life
and you don't even remember?

1204
01:17:17,637 --> 01:17:21,573
Sure! Sean was the sober alcoholic
and you wouldn't quit drinkin'.

1205
01:17:21,641 --> 01:17:23,802
All you know is his side.

1206
01:17:23,877 --> 01:17:28,211
We got drunk together for years and I took
care of him. I took care of everything.

1207
01:17:28,281 --> 01:17:31,409
Then he sobers up and all of a
sudden he wants to be in charge.

1208
01:17:31,484 --> 01:17:34,510
He was so different it scared me.

1209
01:17:34,587 --> 01:17:38,079
I was afraid I was gonna lose him
so I got drunk a few times.

1210
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:39,648
Like now.

1211
01:17:39,726 --> 01:17:42,126
But I was trying to get help
when he left with the kids.

1212
01:17:42,195 --> 01:17:46,256
- Did he tell you that?
- Lady, you got a problem, call her on the show.

1213
01:17:46,332 --> 01:17:49,699
- Let's go.
- Just wait a minute!

1214
01:17:49,769 --> 01:17:52,567
He told me you didn't have kids.

1215
01:17:52,639 --> 01:17:56,097
You think everybody that calls
is telling nothing but the truth?

1216
01:17:56,176 --> 01:18:00,374
I thought... Well, sure!
Why would they lie?

1217
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:02,915
They're not talking to a friend on
the phone, they're on the radio!

1218
01:18:02,982 --> 01:18:05,849
Of course they're not going
to tell you the whole truth.

1219
01:18:05,919 --> 01:18:09,446
You tell them what to do and you don't
even know what's going on with 'em.

1220
01:18:09,522 --> 01:18:12,980
Are you gonna go?
Or do we have to move you?

1221
01:18:16,329 --> 01:18:18,991
I'm sober now.

1222
01:18:19,065 --> 01:18:24,196
And I am trying to get
my family back together.

1223
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:27,262
I just thought
you should know, is all.

1224
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:31,299
Great, well, thanks.
Can you believe that?

1225
01:18:31,377 --> 01:18:35,143
These whiny little people thinking they
can blame you for their pathetic lives?

1226
01:18:35,215 --> 01:18:38,343
What a loser! Geez.

1227
01:18:38,418 --> 01:18:40,443
Hey, lady?

1228
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:42,988
- Come on, guys!
- Look out, Mac.

1229
01:18:48,061 --> 01:18:50,996
Excuse us.

1230
01:19:00,139 --> 01:19:02,073
W-N-D-Y...

1231
01:19:02,141 --> 01:19:06,908
is proud to present Chicago's
foremost radio psychologist...

1232
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:09,608
Dr. Shirlee!

1233
01:19:09,682 --> 01:19:13,812
"This is Dr. Shirlee and I want
to welcome our new listeners.

1234
01:19:13,887 --> 01:19:17,186
"I feel privileged to have you
listenin' in and I hope you'll call...

1235
01:19:17,257 --> 01:19:19,418
"because without you...

1236
01:19:22,195 --> 01:19:24,823
without you..."

1237
01:19:49,989 --> 01:19:51,957
I'm sorry.

1238
01:19:52,025 --> 01:19:56,485
I can't do this.

1239
01:19:56,563 --> 01:19:59,930
I just can't!

1240
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:02,126
I've been lying to you.

1241
01:20:02,201 --> 01:20:05,034
I'm not a doctor.

1242
01:20:05,104 --> 01:20:10,007
In fact, my last job was teachin'
dancin' in a place called Flat River.

1243
01:20:10,076 --> 01:20:13,534
I've been lyin' to all you people.

1244
01:20:13,613 --> 01:20:17,947
I'm not qualified
to give you advice.

1245
01:20:18,017 --> 01:20:20,542
Maybe nobody is.

1246
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:25,023
After talkin' to you two or
three minutes on the radio...

1247
01:20:25,091 --> 01:20:28,549
I'm givin' you advice based
on the version of the truth...

1248
01:20:28,628 --> 01:20:32,029
that you want me and
the listeners to hear.

1249
01:20:32,098 --> 01:20:33,895
Sean...

1250
01:20:33,967 --> 01:20:37,960
if you're out there,
Lord knows I hope you're listenin'.

1251
01:20:38,037 --> 01:20:41,302
If you left your wife
because I told you to...

1252
01:20:41,374 --> 01:20:44,434
well, you left
for the wrong reasons.

1253
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:49,345
Never let anybody tell you
whether to stay or go...

1254
01:20:49,415 --> 01:20:51,508
whether to take this job
or that job...

1255
01:20:51,584 --> 01:20:56,351
whether to put up with
your mother or tell her off.

1256
01:20:56,422 --> 01:20:58,515
You know why?

1257
01:20:58,591 --> 01:21:02,755
Because it's your life.
It's gotta be your decision.

1258
01:21:04,998 --> 01:21:09,128
Maybe what's right for somebody
else, may not be right for you.

1259
01:21:11,204 --> 01:21:13,297
Sean...

1260
01:21:13,373 --> 01:21:15,466
Ann loves you.

1261
01:21:15,541 --> 01:21:19,307
Talk together.
Work it out together.

1262
01:21:19,379 --> 01:21:21,370
You decide what to do.

1263
01:21:21,447 --> 01:21:24,644
Lord, I've never come up
with a solution in my own life...

1264
01:21:24,717 --> 01:21:27,311
that wasn't worse than the problem
I had in the first place...

1265
01:21:27,387 --> 01:21:30,447
so who in the hell am
I to be tellin' you anything?

1266
01:21:30,523 --> 01:21:33,549
I can't do it anymore.

1267
01:21:33,626 --> 01:21:36,595
I'm done lyin' to you.

1268
01:21:36,663 --> 01:21:39,826
I thank you for listenin'.

1269
01:21:39,899 --> 01:21:42,231
This is Shirlee signing off.

1270
01:21:53,212 --> 01:21:56,739
I'm returnin' the car.
It goes with the job.

1271
01:21:59,519 --> 01:22:02,488
Wherever you're going,
you'll need a car.

1272
01:22:02,555 --> 01:22:05,854
Nobody needs a $60,000 car.

1273
01:22:05,925 --> 01:22:09,292
Anyway, I'm not really a Mercedes.

1274
01:22:09,362 --> 01:22:13,162
I'm just a plain old Pontiac.

1275
01:22:14,901 --> 01:22:17,131
Maybe a Chevy.

1276
01:22:32,351 --> 01:22:35,752
- So you haven't seen her?
- No sign of her, sir.

1277
01:22:48,234 --> 01:22:50,202
Go ahead. You're on.

1278
01:22:50,269 --> 01:22:53,238
- Hi, this is Debbie from Glen Oaks.
- Hi.

1279
01:22:53,306 --> 01:22:56,673
Maybe we could do something
to show Shirlee we care about her.

1280
01:22:56,743 --> 01:22:58,677
And what would that be?

1281
01:22:58,745 --> 01:23:03,773
- She was always talking about
honking your own horn. - Yeah.

1282
01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:08,344
Maybe we could honk our
horns at, like, midnight.

1283
01:23:08,421 --> 01:23:11,083
Great! Great!

1284
01:23:11,157 --> 01:23:13,990
Honk your horns
for Shirlee at midnight!

1285
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:18,827
There's no flight anywhere near Flat
River, Arkansas, tonight at all?

1286
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:22,964
Okay, yes, sorry. Thanks.

1287
01:23:24,403 --> 01:23:27,429
Hey, I thought you got fired.

1288
01:23:27,507 --> 01:23:29,873
Close. I quit.

1289
01:23:29,942 --> 01:23:32,342
Just making a phone call.
It was a toll-free number.

1290
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:13,080
Don’t jump.!

1291
01:24:13,152 --> 01:24:16,849
- Don't jump. Don't jump!
- Not again.

1292
01:24:16,923 --> 01:24:19,915
Law of averages,
this time you'll kill me.

1293
01:24:19,992 --> 01:24:21,789
What are you doing here?

1294
01:24:21,861 --> 01:24:23,920
Wishin'.

1295
01:24:23,996 --> 01:24:25,759
Wishin' for what?

1296
01:24:27,934 --> 01:24:31,301
Wishin' I knew
what to wish for now.

1297
01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:33,304
You were right.

1298
01:24:33,372 --> 01:24:37,536
I'm just a dance teacher with some
cheap advice and easy answers.

1299
01:24:38,878 --> 01:24:41,346
No, I wasn't.

1300
01:24:41,414 --> 01:24:44,679
Not according to your listeners.

1301
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:47,344
They've been calling
since you walked off.

1302
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:51,584
Talking about how much they
love you, how you've helped them...

1303
01:24:51,657 --> 01:24:57,152
how the days and nights are easier thanks
to Shirlee's laughter, Shirlee's wisdom.

1304
01:24:57,230 --> 01:24:59,198
It's you they need, Shirlee.

1305
01:24:59,265 --> 01:25:02,860
It doesn't matter if you're a
dance teacher or trapeze artist.

1306
01:25:02,935 --> 01:25:06,268
It doesn't matter! It's you.

1307
01:25:06,339 --> 01:25:08,807
What about Sean?
I could've wrecked his marriage!

1308
01:25:08,875 --> 01:25:12,003
Sean called right after you walked off.
He was gonna leave her anyway.

1309
01:25:12,078 --> 01:25:14,069
He just wanted somebody
to agree with him.

1310
01:25:14,146 --> 01:25:17,138
If it hadn't been you,
it would've been someone else.

1311
01:25:17,216 --> 01:25:19,980
What's that?

1312
01:25:20,853 --> 01:25:22,912
Stay right here.

1313
01:25:24,557 --> 01:25:26,582
It's 12.00...

1314
01:25:26,659 --> 01:25:29,651
and if you're not honking your horn
for Shirlee, you should be.

1315
01:25:29,729 --> 01:25:32,163
They're honkin' for me?

1316
01:25:32,231 --> 01:25:34,426
Perlman had this idea that
everybody who cared about you...

1317
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:36,695
should honk their horns
at midnight.

1318
01:25:36,769 --> 01:25:40,296
Everybody who cares about me
is honkin' their horn?

1319
01:25:40,373 --> 01:25:42,841
Everybody who loves you
is honking their horn.

1320
01:25:45,711 --> 01:25:47,702
Shirlee...

1321
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:51,614
what do you think about
the idea of a fresh start?

1322
01:25:56,689 --> 01:25:58,919
I'm sorry, Jack.

1323
01:25:58,991 --> 01:26:02,984
I just don't have another
fresh start left in me.

1324
01:26:23,849 --> 01:26:25,908
I'm sick of cornflakes.

1325
01:26:28,354 --> 01:26:30,754
Cornflakes?

1326
01:26:30,823 --> 01:26:34,589
I don't want to keep any more
cookies in the cookie jar.

1327
01:26:48,808 --> 01:26:51,402
Release the woman.!

1328
01:26:51,477 --> 01:26:54,105
Release the woman and place
your hands on your head.

1329
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:57,547
- What?
- They think you're tryin' to murder me.

1330
01:26:57,616 --> 01:26:59,550
Hands on head!

1331
01:27:02,088 --> 01:27:05,922
- They think you're tryin' to push
me off the bridge. - Very funny.

1332
01:27:05,992 --> 01:27:08,756
Hey, Dr. Shirlee.
It's me, Phil, remember?

1333
01:27:08,828 --> 01:27:11,194
How's your daughter?

1334
01:27:11,263 --> 01:27:14,460
She's back in school and doing well
thanks to you, Dr. Shirlee.

1335
01:27:14,533 --> 01:27:17,559
- It's just Shirlee now.
- What?

1336
01:27:17,636 --> 01:27:20,605
I'm just Shirlee!

1337
01:27:29,882 --> 01:27:32,373
Gimme some straight talk
straight talk

1338
01:27:32,451 --> 01:27:34,976
And hold the sugar please

1339
01:27:35,054 --> 01:27:38,922
Straight talk, straight talk
sounds plenty sweet to me

1340
01:27:38,991 --> 01:27:43,257
Don't talk to me in circles
in some mumbo-jumbo jive

1341
01:27:43,329 --> 01:27:47,959
Gimme just straight talk
and we're gonna be all right

1342
01:27:48,034 --> 01:27:51,629
- - Hello, Shirlee here.
What can I do for you?

1343
01:27:51,704 --> 01:27:54,070
I feel women are
more evolved than men.

1344
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:56,074
Maybe the world
is tougher for them.

1345
01:27:56,142 --> 01:27:58,235
But I know I'll be happier
as a woman.

1346
01:27:58,310 --> 01:28:00,335
I'm already a female inside.

1347
01:28:00,413 --> 01:28:04,645
I want to be one on the outside too,
so I'm getting the change.

1348
01:28:04,717 --> 01:28:08,619
I was wondering if
you had any advice for me.

1349
01:28:08,687 --> 01:28:13,522
Gary, if you're sure that's what
you really want, all I can say is...

1350
01:28:13,592 --> 01:28:16,561
don't try to perm your own hair...

1351
01:28:16,629 --> 01:28:19,792
and don't wear high heels
on a soggy lawn.

1352
01:28:19,865 --> 01:28:22,857
Shirlee here.
What's cooking?

1353
01:28:22,935 --> 01:28:25,665
Pick up the phone you're not alone

1354
01:28:25,738 --> 01:28:27,831
We've all got something to say

1355
01:28:27,907 --> 01:28:32,344
Listen in and listen up
we'll find a better way

1356
01:28:32,411 --> 01:28:37,212
With honesty and common sense
it's really hard to miss

1357
01:28:37,283 --> 01:28:41,720
Straight talk, straight talk
just tell it like it is

1358
01:28:41,787 --> 01:28:46,087
Straight talk, straight talk
don't sugar-coat it please

1359
01:28:46,158 --> 01:28:50,322
Straight talk, straight talk
sounds sweet enough to me

1360
01:28:50,396 --> 01:28:54,992
Don't talk to me in circles
in some mumbo-jumbo jive

1361
01:28:55,067 --> 01:29:01,967
Straight talk, straight talk
and we're gonna be all right

1362
01:29:02,842 --> 01:29:06,778
Straight talk, straight talk
makes plenty sense to me

1363
01:29:06,846 --> 01:29:11,215
Don't talk to me in circles
in some mumbo-jumbo jive

1364
01:29:11,283 --> 01:29:15,276
Give me just straight talk
and we're gonna be all right

1365
01:29:15,354 --> 01:29:17,879
Give me just straight talk,
straight talk

1366
01:29:17,957 --> 01:29:21,120
And we're gonna

1367
01:29:21,193 --> 01:29:28,093
Be all right

1368
01:29:30,503 --> 01:29:34,200
[ "Light Of A Clear

1369
01:29:34,273 --> 01:29:40,269
I can see the light
of a clear blue morning

1370
01:29:40,346 --> 01:29:45,841
I can see the light
of a brand-new... day

1371
01:29:45,918 --> 01:29:48,751
