1
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,440
How long now?

2
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,400
A week.

3
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,640
Did you alert the police?

4
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,480
No.

5
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,560
We worked in the same factory.

6
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,520
They haven't heard
from him either.

7
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,160
You can't reach him?

8
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,280
No.

9
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,640
His cell phone doesn't answer.

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,960
He's Spanish;
maybe he went back.

11
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,280
Did he leave you any money?

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,840
No.

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,400
You have three months'
back rent.

14
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,400
It's hard, on my own,
with two kids.

15
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,160
I can't manage.

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,880
You don't work?

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,440
No, I took sick leave
to look after the baby.

18
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,000
But I'm struggling.

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,000
I wanted to ask you...

20
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,240
Yes?

21
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,280
Could he go into foster care,
just for a while?

22
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,640
Is he difficult?

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,240
Sort of.

24
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,920
He cries a lot.

25
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,560
I'm at my wits' end.
I can't cope.

26
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,440
Placing a child in care
is a big decision.

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,880
It's a complicated process.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,040
Maybe you just need some time,
or home help.

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,920
Maybe.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,040
Let's consider the options.

31
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,600
You need to fill out
a declaration

32
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,840
of marital abandonment
with the police.

33
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,600
You may be eligible for aid.

34
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,480
I'll put in a request
for childcare...

35
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,040
"Several months earlier"

36
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,200
Time to get up, Mommy.

37
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,320
I know.

38
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,600
Come here.

39
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,520
Get up.
We'll be late.

40
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,680
I don't want to work today.

41
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,640
Is your bag ready?

42
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,400
Yeah.
I need to brush my teeth.

43
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,600
Hurry up.

44
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,960
- Mommy?
- Hmm?

45
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,360
Why don't you want
to work today?

46
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,840
Some days are like that.

47
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,520
Get on.

48
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,240
- Hanging on tight?
- Yeah.

49
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,080
Bye, honey.

50
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,360
Be good.

51
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,840
Will you pick me up?

52
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,120
Yeah, ten past 5:00.
Wait outside.

53
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,360
- See you tonight.
- See you tonight.

54
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,280
Ready?

55
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,520
Not so hot.

56
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,080
Hi.

57
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,160
Hello.

58
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,760
Got a cigarette?

59
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,920
Sure.

60
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,080
Thanks.

61
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,760
Thanks.

62
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,840
I'm Paco.

63
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,840
I'm Katie.

64
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,720
Oh, shit.

65
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,560
Where were you?
Alley B?

66
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,800
No.
Why?

67
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,400
There was a leak.

68
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,880
Get back to work.

69
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,200
Odile, switch stations.

70
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,200
Thanks, Odile.

71
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,640
Sorry, honey.
I got held up at work.

72
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,760
Get on.

73
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,800
My helmet?

74
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,520
Shit.
I left it at work.

75
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,000
Wear mine.

76
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,120
It's too big.

77
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,280
Better than nothing.

78
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,160
- You good?
- Yeah.

79
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,880
- Hanging on tight?
- Yeah.

80
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,440
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, Mommy.

81
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,080
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

82
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,440
Mommy?

83
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,240
What?

84
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,640
Can you leave
the hall light on?

85
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,400
What's wrong?

86
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,840
I'm scared.

87
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,600
Of what?

88
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't know.

89
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,840
I'm here.
Don't be scared.

90
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,360
Sleep tight.

91
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,840
See you tomorrow.

92
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,640
- Good night.
- Good night.

93
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,440
See you tomorrow, Odile.

94
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,840
See you tomorrow.

95
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,760
I owe you one.

96
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,760
No, thanks.

97
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,400
What happened between us
was an accident.

98
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,760
I never do that.

99
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,200
Me neither.

100
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,680
Where are you going?

101
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,440
To a restaurant.

102
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,400
With who?

103
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,720
Some friends.

104
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,280
Will you be late?

105
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,720
No.
Go get ready for bed.

106
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,080
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

107
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,320
Sorry I'm late.

108
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,960
I'd given up on you.

109
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,560
But here I am.

110
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,280
Shall we order?

111
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,720
Yes.

112
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,240
Menus, please.

113
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,040
Finished?

114
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,360
Yeah.

115
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,600
May l?

116
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,880
Sure.

117
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,480
How old is your daughter?

118
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,240
Seven.

119
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,920
Where's her dad?

120
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,840
Down south.

121
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,640
I don't see him anymore.

122
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,240
Why not?

123
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,520
He won't see her.

124
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,560
Really?

125
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,640
He didn't want me
to have her.

126
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,680
Does she miss having a dad?

127
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,840
I don't think so.

128
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,360
We're a team.

129
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,800
Do you have kids?

130
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,880
No.

131
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,600
Not that I know of.

132
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,480
Ever been married?

133
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,960
In Spain, when I was young.

134
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,800
It didn't last.

135
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,480
What floor?

136
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,080
High, very high.

137
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,600
- Katie?
- Yes?

138
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,600
Stop. We'll wake up
the building.

139
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,960
Come on.

140
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,920
Am I too hairy?

141
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,200
No.
It's soft.

142
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,200
I never liked it.

143
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,920
I always wanted
a swimmer's body: smooth.

144
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,240
I like it.

145
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,720
It's animal.

146
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,080
Paco, my daughter, Lisa.

147
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,160
Hi, Lisa.

148
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,320
How are you?

149
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,760
Answer.
Don't be shy.

150
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,960
Sorry.
I think I scared her.

151
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,040
She just doesn't know you.

152
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,920
Be right back.

153
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,600
Lisa, Paco might come live
with us.

154
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,760
Will you get married?

155
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,840
I don't know.

156
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,360
We'll see.

157
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,040
We'll be like a new family?

158
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,240
Mm-hmm.

159
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,960
Paco?

160
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,280
The boss wants to see you.

161
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,440
What for?

162
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,680
Don't know.

163
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,720
Take over for me.

164
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,400
Yeah?

165
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,280
Your neighbor called.

166
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,920
Katie's in the hospital.

167
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,160
What will his name be?

168
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,440
What name do you like?

169
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,760
- Ricky.
- Ricky?

170
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,320
Is that a cartoon character?

171
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,320
No.

172
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,320
Where'd it come from?

173
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,320
I don't know.

174
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,280
Got a boyfriend named Ricky?

175
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,440
I don't have a boyfriend.

176
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,320
Mr. Sanchez?

177
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,160
Yes.
How'd it go?

178
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,360
You have a big baby boy.

179
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,600
How's Katie?

180
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,200
Fine.
She's resting.

181
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,680
Good.

182
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,720
It's nice to be home.

183
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,360
- Mommy.
- What?

184
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,200
Come see my room.

185
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,920
What'd you do?

186
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,560
Surprise.

187
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,720
Ah, Paco.

188
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,360
Like it?

189
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,600
It's great.

190
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,840
Ricky's sleeping in my room?

191
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,640
After I stop breast-feeding.

192
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,280
To my son,
the world's most beautiful baby!

193
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,040
- To Ricky.
- To Ricky.

194
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,680
- To Ricky.
- To Ricky.

195
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,320
I just fed him
a half hour ago.

196
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,600
He wants some champagne too.

197
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,520
Here's to you...

198
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,840
Stop it.
Go get the chicken.

199
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,840
I have to feed him again.

200
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,000
Later.
The chicken's hot.

201
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,240
Go eat the chicken Dad made.

202
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,360
He's Paco, not Dad.

203
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,480
White meat, Lisa?

204
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,280
- No.
- A thigh?

205
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,560
I want a wing.

206
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,960
A wing it is.

207
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,840
Want some?

208
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,560
Mom and I don't eat that.

209
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,880
I wanted to give you a treat.

210
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,720
You don't like scrambled eggs?

211
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,280
I don't know.

212
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,360
Give it a try.
You'll see.

213
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,960
It's delicious.

214
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,200
When do we eat, Mom?

215
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,280
When Paco's back.

216
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,720
Where the hell is he?

217
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,720
Lottery time.
Hand me my purse.

218
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,680
Number 34.

219
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,840
Number 26.

220
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,080
And the bonus number is 41.

221
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,200
Well?

222
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,200
We lost, as usual.

223
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,720
Hi.

224
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,880
Where were you?

225
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,600
Out with the guys.

226
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,920
You could've phoned.

227
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,120
Get off my back.

228
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,800
Make your son shut up.

229
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,040
He's your son too.
You've got him tomorrow.

230
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,320
I know!

231
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,720
Make an effort.

232
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,960
I'm gonna work nights
to be with him days!

233
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,360
You wanted him, so pitch in!

234
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,720
Stop nagging!
I'm tired too!

235
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,920
This is hard on me!

236
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
He cries all day.
I'm exhausted!

237
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,040
Want your milk?

238
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,240
Stop screaming!

239
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,160
I'm so sick of this!

240
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,560
Mad at me?

241
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,560
Yes.

242
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,880
I'm sorry.

243
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,600
Things are rough at work.

244
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,880
It's hard for me too,
with the rent, the baby...

245
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,360
I know.

246
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,720
Are you sure it's not Ricky?

247
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,040
What do you mean?

248
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,600
You've changed
since he came along.

249
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,680
No, I haven't.

250
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,760
You've changed.

251
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,400
He gets all the attention.

252
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,360
Tomorrow I go back to work.

253
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,360
It'll be like before.

254
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,440
I hope so.

255
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,440
It will.

256
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,680
I'm coming, Ricky!

257
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,880
Listen.

258
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,320
The bottle's not hot yet.
Three more minutes.

259
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,800
I'll be right back.

260
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,520
It's almost ready!

261
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,760
You're okay.
Come on.

262
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,600
You're okay.

263
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:41,480
Whoa, Ricky.
Swell.

264
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,080
Nice job!

265
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,320
Fucking hell.
What a mess.

266
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,320
What's wrong?

267
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,560
Is that better?

268
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,000
Go to sleep now.

269
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,760
Mom, look.

270
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,360
Hi, sweetie.

271
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,280
How'd it go?

272
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,440
Good, I think.

273
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,120
How many bottles?

274
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,640
Two, like you said.

275
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,320
You're perfect.

276
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,320
Time for your bath.

277
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,680
What, Ricky?
Didn't you have fun with Dad?

278
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,320
Didn't he take good care of you?

279
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,600
Can I help with your homework?

280
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,600
If you want.

281
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,760
But your French is so bad.

282
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,200
Not true.

283
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,520
I have an accent,
but I'm fluent.

284
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,960
Paco!

285
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,360
What?

286
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,360
Come here, please.

287
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,240
What?

288
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,480
What's this?

289
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,360
What?

290
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,720
Shit.
What's that?

291
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,240
A lump.

292
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,280
How'd he get it?

293
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,160
It wasn't there this morning.

294
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,440
Paco, tell me the truth.
Did you drop him?

295
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,640
Are you crazy?
I was careful.

296
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,040
Well, something happened.

297
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,400
Stop it.
Nothing happened.

298
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,560
Stop imagining things.

299
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,760
Look, I don't know.

300
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,560
Maybe I accidentally knocked him
against the crib.

301
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,760
"Knocked him"?

302
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,480
It's just a bruise!

303
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,040
What's wrong with Ricky?

304
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,720
Nothing.

305
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,680
Mommy?

306
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,000
Why aren't you in bed?

307
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,520
I can't sleep.

308
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,080
What is it now?

309
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,160
Is Ricky going to die?

310
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,040
No, don't be silly.
Get back to bed.

311
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,800
Don't cry, my baby.
I'm here.

312
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,640
It's okay.

313
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,240
What's wrong?
It hurts again?

314
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,560
Does it hurt, Ricky?

315
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:51,120
You'll be all right.
Wait a minute.

316
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,240
My God.

317
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,440
Up already?

318
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,000
I didn't sleep.

319
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,960
What now?

320
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,640
We have to talk.

321
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,160
I just did
my first night shift.

322
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,040
I need sleep.

323
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,040
We'll talk tonight.

324
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,920
No.

325
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,040
It's too serious.

326
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,680
What's too serious?

327
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,880
What you did to Ricky.

328
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,880
Here we go again.

329
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,240
He's got two bruises.

330
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,400
What did you do?

331
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,440
You think I hit your son?

332
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,360
Yes.

333
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,480
Fine.

334
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,560
Where are you going?

335
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,640
Did Paco leave?

336
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,920
Yes, he left.

337
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,640
Ricky, shut up!

338
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,360
Does it hurt?

339
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,800
Must be your lumps.

340
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,160
You're bleeding.

341
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,320
No wonder you're crying.

342
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,400
I'll disinfect it for you.

343
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,720
This won't hurt.

344
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,400
There.

345
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,080
Some cotton...

346
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,760
And two bandages.

347
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,160
Hi, Mom.

348
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,120
Hi.

349
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,480
Did you feed Ricky?

350
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,200
Not yet.

351
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,640
Go get him.
I'll heat the milk.

352
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,960
Ricky?

353
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,600
Mommy, Mommy!

354
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,600
- What?
- Ricky!

355
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,520
- What's wrong?
- He's not in his crib.

356
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,560
No way!

357
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,440
What's this?

358
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,880
You left the window open?

359
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,400
I didn't do anything.

360
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,920
Did Paco come back?

361
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,280
Nobody came.

362
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,400
Ricky?

363
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,200
Ricky.

364
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,400
Ricky, Ricky.

365
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,680
- Ricky.
- Ricky?

366
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,600
Ricky?

367
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,520
Mommy, look.

368
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,680
My God.

369
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,880
How'd he get up there?

370
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,040
I don't know.

371
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,440
Don't move, sweetie.

372
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,440
Mommy's coming.

373
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,760
Come here, Ricky.

374
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,320
Careful.

375
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,560
Come on, Ricky.
Come to Mommy.

376
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,960
That's it, honey.

377
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,640
Almost there.

378
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,960
Ricky.

379
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,120
What's that?

380
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,080
No idea.

381
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,240
I've never seen anything
like it.

382
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,480
What the hell?

383
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,120
His lumps opened?

384
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,560
I don't know.

385
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,360
It's so bloody.

386
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,520
Gross.

387
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,800
They move.

388
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,120
Watch out!

389
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,800
Lisa, give me a hand.

390
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,880
Rinse him off, gently.

391
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,560
Come see.

392
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,760
Look at these.

393
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,640
Like tiny fingernails.

394
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,760
Weird.

395
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,760
Be gentle.
Maybe they hurt.

396
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,800
You okay, Ricky?

397
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,720
Let's clean off the blood.

398
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,560
Really carefully.

399
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,840
Rinse over here.

400
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,240
They're bound to drop off.

401
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,360
Take the towel
and get the sheet.

402
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,720
There.

403
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,720
Hand me the clothespins.

404
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,880
You okay, Ricky?

405
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,520
There.

406
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,880
That should keep him in.

407
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,120
It's like a cage.

408
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,360
But if he goes back up there,
he'll hurt himself.

409
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,880
We'll see the doctor?

410
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,120
No, no doctors.

411
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,120
Thank you.

412
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,360
Listen, Lisa.

413
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,680
What?

414
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,880
Keep quiet at school.

415
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,880
Don't talk about Ricky.

416
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,720
Why?

417
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,560
He's different.

418
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
Could someone hurt him?

419
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,600
Yes.

420
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,280
Morning, Mommy.

421
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,240
Morning, honey.

422
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,560
Sleep well?

423
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,840
Yes.

424
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,320
Ricky's still sleeping?

425
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,440
Yes.

426
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,800
Did he wake up in the night?

427
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,120
No.

428
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,360
Seems he's sleeping
better now.

429
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,760
What are you doing?

430
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,120
Measuring his wings.

431
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,720
They've grown.

432
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,280
Come help me.

433
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,480
Keep still, Ricky.

434
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,080
There.
That's right.

435
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,240
Here.

436
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,080
Hold it for me.

437
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,880
Let's see.

438
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,920
That makes...

439
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,480
1 7 centimeters.

440
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,880
Is that big?

441
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,320
Well...

442
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,960
It's grown 8 centimeters
in a week.

443
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,120
That's big.

444
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,160
Let's tape it down.

445
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,800
We'll give it a try.

446
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,800
Nope.

447
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,200
- No good.
- No good at all.

448
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,880
Stupid idea.

449
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,200
I've got another one.

450
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,600
What?

451
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:26,000
Come with me.
I've got a plan.

452
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,320
Go get my sewing kit.

453
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,480
Bring me his shirts.

454
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,840
Got it?

455
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,720
Yeah.

456
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,760
Good job.

457
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,280
I've got him.

458
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,000
Like so...

459
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,200
There.

460
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,360
Perfect. Huh?

461
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,280
Suits him.

462
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,320
He's like an angel.

463
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,680
More like a chicken.

464
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,240
Go on, Ricky.

465
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,640
Wow, excellent.

466
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,920
Good job, Ricky.

467
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,440
Did you see that, Mommy?

468
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,400
Bravo.

469
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:22,960
Mommy?

470
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,000
Will Ricky fly one day?

471
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,520
Without feathers,
it'll be hard.

472
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,280
First, he needs to walk.

473
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,280
Hi, Lisa.

474
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,200
Hi.

475
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,920
Where's your mom?

476
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,120
I'm taking the bus.

477
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,080
How are you?

478
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,600
Fine.

479
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,720
How's your mom?

480
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,320
That's my bus.
Gotta go.

481
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,160
Bye.

482
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,600
Lisa, Lisa, Lisa.

483
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,000
How's Ricky, better?

484
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,000
Yeah, he's good.

485
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,400
Hi.
Can I help you?

486
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,880
Yes, I'm looking
for a book about wings.

487
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,080
Wings?

488
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,560
Yeah, bird wings.

489
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,680
A novel?

490
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,800
No. More of a science book.

491
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,840
- Anatomy?
- Yes, that's it.

492
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,040
Don't touch the food.

493
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,560
Sorry.

494
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,720
Want a bird?

495
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,640
What's
the weight-to-wingspan ratio?

496
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,880
I'm just a butcher.

497
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,400
What's this one weigh?

498
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,120
Let's see.

499
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,920
4 kilos, 300 grams.

500
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,960
4 kilos, 300 grams...

501
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,600
Ricky weighs 8 kilos.

502
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,400
So that means...

503
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,400
Okay. You want it?

504
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,920
No, thanks.

505
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,240
Good-bye.

506
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,400
Excuse me.

507
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,960
I need a child's helmet.

508
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,640
Motorcycle or bicycle?

509
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,320
The strongest, motorcycle.

510
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,440
How old is the child?

511
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,120
A baby.

512
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,800
Babies aren't allowed
on motorcycles.

513
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,840
Whatever's smallest.

514
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,160
Hi, honey.

515
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,160
Hi, Mom.

516
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,400
I got loads of stuff.

517
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,000
How's Ricky?

518
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,760
Shut in his crib.

519
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,480
Get me a present?

520
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,400
No, honey, it's for Ricky.

521
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,520
Look at the cool book I found.

522
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,120
This way,
he won't hurt himself.

523
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,440
Here too.

524
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,280
Get a pillow.

525
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,520
Perfect.

526
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,120
Fasten it tight.

527
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,800
Don't worry.

528
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,600
Help me put this on.

529
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,160
There.

530
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,160
Raise your little arm.

531
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,440
Now for the helmet.

532
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,040
He could've used mine.

533
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,680
Yours is too heavy.
This one's light.

534
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,760
There.

535
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,760
Show us your stuff.

536
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,080
Good job!

537
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,360
Careful.

538
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,760
What's he doing?

539
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,080
Turn out the light.

540
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,400
That's it.

541
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,080
Very good, Ricky.

542
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,080
Are you okay?

543
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,120
Did you hurt yourself?

544
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,160
Good thing we used
the pillows.

545
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:05,840
Let me take off your helmet.

546
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,320
That's better.

547
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,040
Look at his wing.

548
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,960
You just took
your first flight!

549
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,160
What a good boy!

550
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,440
It's okay now, Ricky.

551
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,920
Here.

552
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,240
And Paco?

553
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:36,240
What made you think of him?

554
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,160
I don't think of him
now Ricky has wings.

555
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:43,080
There.
All better.

556
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,400
Did we win?

557
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,280
No, we only got five numbers.

558
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,640
Five numbers?

559
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:53,160
Let me see.

560
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,000
We won.

561
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,200
2,000 euros.

562
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,560
Less than I thought,
but still.

563
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,280
Ricky brought us luck.

564
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,920
Let's go shopping.

565
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,760
Can we eat out for Christmas?

566
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:18,240
Maybe, the two of us.
The three of us.

567
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,160
This way, Mom!

568
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,120
Slow down, Lisa.

569
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,640
Here.

570
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,400
It's so crowded.

571
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,240
Show me, quick.

572
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,040
Be right back.

573
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,240
A bit pricey for Santa Claus.

574
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,040
But we're rich now.

575
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,040
Go on, then.

576
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,240
Mommy.

577
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,760
Where's Ricky?

578
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,840
- Look.
- Shit!

579
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,320
He took it off.

580
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,320
Up there!

581
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,760
Quick.

582
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,200
Come on.

583
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,200
Where's he going?
Ricky!

584
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,320
What do we do?

585
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,600
I don't know.

586
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,800
Honey, look!

587
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,800
Ricky!

588
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,200
Ricky, wait!

589
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,480
He'll burn his wings.

590
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,800
This way, hurry!

591
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,040
We'll never catch him.

592
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,280
I want a remote-control baby.

593
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,040
- Ricky!
- Ricky!

594
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:41,040
Ladies and gentlemen,
please leave the premises

595
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,720
as quickly as you can
for security reasons.

596
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:48,000
An unidentified flying object
has been seen over the aisles.

597
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,920
Set up the ladders.

598
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,920
Turn out the lights,
and he'll come down.

599
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,240
All right.

600
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,680
Loïc, have them cut
the lights.

601
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,760
Right.

602
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,000
Christophe?

603
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:13,320
Cut the lights, please.

604
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,600
Where's he going?

605
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,240
Fresh foods.

606
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,120
Shit.

607
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,600
Come on, this way.

608
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,200
He'll end up frozen.

609
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,680
Don't be silly.

610
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:47,240
Hide there, on the left!

611
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,560
Wait, wait.

612
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,960
Go!

613
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,080
I got him!

614
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,320
Don't hurt him!

615
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,160
Remain calm.

616
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,720
If I lose Ricky, after Paco...

617
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,760
You've got me, Mom.

618
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,640
The doctor will see you now.

619
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,240
Is he okay?

620
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,960
He's fine.

621
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,920
Here they are.

622
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,440
Ah, good evening.

623
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,000
Good evening.

624
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,280
So you're the mother?

625
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,360
Yes.
This is my daughter, Lisa.

626
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,200
Nice to meet you.

627
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,960
Have a seat.

628
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,640
Where is he?

629
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,400
Sleeping in a room nearby.

630
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,080
You gave him a shot?

631
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:20,800
No, he was tired
and fell asleep naturally.

632
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,160
I must say, your son
is a fascinating enigma.

633
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,120
I called several colleagues
and veterinarians.

634
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,200
They're baffled and...

635
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,120
You'll make him a lab rat.

636
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,720
Of course not.

637
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,600
We'll do nothing
unless you approve.

638
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,840
But your son should undergo
extensive tests.

639
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,240
So should you, as his mother.

640
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,480
And his father too.

641
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:46,480
Does he have
any distinguishing features?

642
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,960
- Yes.
- Ah.

643
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,240
He's very hairy.

644
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:53,960
I don't think that plays a role.

645
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,600
We'd like to keep your son
in observation.

646
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:57,880
No way.

647
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,400
I'm taking him home.

648
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,160
Do you have enough room
for him to thrive?

649
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,760
Yes.

650
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,000
Where does he sleep?

651
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,160
In his cage.

652
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,400
- Cage?
- No.

653
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,520
We put a sheet over his crib
so he can't fly out.

654
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,560
Ah, I see.

655
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,120
But your son
requires special care.

656
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,240
For his well-being,
he should be hospitalized.

657
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,720
You think I'm unfit?

658
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,480
A bad mother?

659
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:39,120
I'm sorry.
This is a hospital.

660
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,640
Break it up.

661
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,440
This way.
Down the stairs.

662
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,600
This is why I want
to keep him here.

663
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:52,880
Bernard?

664
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,400
You'll get no peace.

665
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,680
Meet us in the parking garage.

666
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,560
This way.

667
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,880
This way.

668
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,960
- You okay?
- Yes.

669
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,480
My card.

670
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,200
Don't hesitate to call.

671
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,080
Okay.

672
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,920
The hospital will cover
the taxi fare.

673
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,080
Get in, Lisa.

674
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,320
I'll expect you tomorrow.

675
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,960
Thank you.
Good-bye.

676
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,280
There they go!

677
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,360
Roll the cameras!

678
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,680
Come back, Serge!

679
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,120
Doctor, just a few questions.

680
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,640
No comment.

681
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,920
Just one.

682
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,040
Does the baby really have wings?

683
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,880
We're seeing the doctor
again tomorrow?

684
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,320
No, we're not.

685
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,400
Thank you.
Good night.

686
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,080
Shit.
Stay close.

687
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:39,280
We saw you on TV, Katie.
Let's see him.

688
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,080
No, we're tired.

689
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,880
Show us your little
freak of nature.

690
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,800
Leave us alone, please.

691
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,120
Just a few questions!

692
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,280
Film them.

693
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,720
Take the keys.

694
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,080
The "flying baby"
apparently lives

695
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,560
with his mother
in a council flat.

696
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:03,120
She's a factory worker
and a single mom.

697
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,880
Awhile back, she was living
with some foreigner.

698
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,840
But he left.

699
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,080
It's just her
and her daughter.

700
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,280
I'd hear him crying,

701
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:17,080
but I never imagined
he was bizarre.

702
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,600
The mother refuses
to talk to journalists.

703
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:24,000
The only footage of the baby
comes from cell phones.

704
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,360
The poor quality
suggests the whole thing

705
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,360
could be a hoax.

706
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,840
I'll go get Ricky.

707
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,200
No, leave him.

708
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,040
This is all his fault.

709
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:36,240
You woke me up, Ricky.

710
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,600
There you go.

711
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,160
Happy now?

712
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,080
Be right back.

713
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,520
Stay put.

714
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,040
Mommy, the doorbell.

715
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,520
If it's journalists,
don't open.

716
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,440
Who's there?

717
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,440
Me.

718
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:19,600
Morning, Lisa.

719
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:22,560
Morning.

720
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,080
You're prickly.

721
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:26,720
Is Katie here?

722
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,160
Lisa?

723
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:48,600
Go to your room
so I can talk to Paco.

724
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,400
You're back?

725
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,280
Yeah.

726
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,640
I'm back.

727
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,800
I saw you on TV.

728
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,480
Why didn't you tell me
about Ricky?

729
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,040
It's amazing.

730
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,000
I lost your phone number.

731
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,880
You're still a bad liar.

732
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:26,160
Forgive me.

733
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:55,960
Paco's back.

734
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,920
Maybe he wants to take you.

735
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,840
You'll leave us.

736
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,000
You're upset?

737
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,960
Why?

738
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,640
Because he left
and never took care of you?

739
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:17,200
But he loves you.
He's your dad.

740
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,360
What'd you say?

741
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,680
You're right.

742
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,000
You don't leave
someone you love.

743
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,400
Where is he?

744
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:45,760
With Lisa, in her room.

745
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:48,080
I want to see him.

746
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,960
Where were you?

747
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,440
What'd you do?

748
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:57,880
I was in Paris.

749
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,240
A friend works
in a restaurant there.

750
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,880
I washed dishes,
did a little plumbing.

751
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,280
Were you with women?

752
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,520
Nothing serious.

753
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:17,120
I thought of you.

754
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,120
I missed you, Katie.

755
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,200
Did you miss Ricky?

756
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,160
Of course I did.

757
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,200
He's my son.

758
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:36,920
You let him out?

759
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,680
He wanted a cuddle.

760
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:52,160
Hi, there.

761
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,680
Incredible!

762
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,920
Ricky.

763
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,880
Amazing.

764
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,440
He seems scared.

765
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,640
Ricky!

766
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,000
Careful!
Come down, Ricky.

767
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,600
Come down, honey.

768
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,040
We've gotta catch him.

769
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:12,360
Gently, don't hurt him.

770
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,880
Come on.
That's it.

771
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:14,960
I got him.

772
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,600
Give him to me.

773
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:17,800
It's okay, sweetie.

774
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,280
Poor kid.

775
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,880
You're all right.

776
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
He can't stay here
with those things.

777
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,520
Shut up.

778
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,360
Can't you see he's suffering?

779
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,960
He needs help.

780
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:31,920
He's my son;
it's up to me!

781
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,240
Paco, look.

782
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,240
Well?

783
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,640
A minor injury.
Next time it could be worse.

784
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,600
No bandage?

785
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,120
No need.

786
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,920
But this is
a hostile environment.

787
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:54,600
What'd I tell you?

788
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,200
As you can see,

789
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:59,240
your son's wings are extensions
of his shoulder blades.

790
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,440
Part of the same bone.

791
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,000
They'll continue to grow.

792
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,320
If we operate,
it would be similar

793
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:09,800
to separating Siamese twins
who share bones.

794
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,600
They'll cut off his wings?

795
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:12,840
Listen.

796
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:17,200
The risks are minimal,
but it's quite painful.

797
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,800
And if we don't operate?

798
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:21,680
As I told your wife,
this is new territory.

799
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:26,120
Without the proper care,
he could wither away.

800
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:50,560
What should we do?

801
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,560
I don't know.

802
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,400
Listen, I've been thinking.

803
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,560
I have an idea.

804
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:01,920
We won't let anyone
take him away.

805
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:05,560
But I was thinking...

806
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:09,480
We need money to care
for him properly.

807
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:13,920
Maybe we could negotiate
with certain journalists.

808
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:18,920
Let them film him,
you know, for money.

809
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,840
That's why you're back?

810
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,960
To make money off your son?

811
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,920
I came back for you.

812
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,760
And Ricky.

813
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,440
And Lisa.

814
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:34,920
So we can start over,
be a real family,

815
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,920
in a new house.

816
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,720
I don't believe you.

817
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:46,000
I left because you accused me
of hitting my son.

818
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,400
So please, trust me now.

819
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,520
Look at us.

820
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:57,320
Imagine the new life
we could have, thanks to Ricky.

821
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,760
Hi, everyone.

822
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,520
Good to see you.

823
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,040
Hi, Bernard.

824
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,480
Glad you could make it.

825
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,200
Thanks for the permit.

826
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,440
We're about to start.

827
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,520
Hello.

828
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,120
How are you?

829
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,720
Fine. Hello.

830
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,400
Hello.

831
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,440
- Good crowd, huh?
- Yeah, yeah.

832
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,880
Is he coming?

833
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,440
Yes.
His mom's bringing him.

834
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:28,960
Great.

835
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,160
Excuse me!

836
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,760
Can we get an interview?

837
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:33,400
Not yet.

838
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,360
Can you believe it?

839
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,920
All this for Ricky.

840
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,840
Hello.

841
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,720
Come stand over here.

842
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,280
Who's that?

843
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,440
The journalist
I negotiated with.

844
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,560
Lisa, stay close.

845
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:55,080
Ladies and gentlemen,

846
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,800
these are Ricky's parents,
Mr. and Mrs. Sanchez.

847
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,680
We're not married.

848
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:03,280
What you're about to see
is utterly amazing:

849
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,160
a flying baby.

850
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:09,480
Please keep quiet
so as not to frighten the baby.

851
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:11,040
He's very shy.

852
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,920
Thank you.

853
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:16,200
All set?

854
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,000
Make him fly!

855
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:28,040
Wonderful.
Go on.

856
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,800
Look, he's flying!

857
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,920
Katie, the string.

858
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,040
Shit!

859
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,080
You let it go.

860
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,520
Ricky?
Ricky?

861
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:58,720
Ricky?

862
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:01,880
Ricky?

863
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,520
Ricky!

864
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,920
Come on.
Follow him.

865
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:11,120
He could be attracted to...

866
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,200
What?

867
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,000
The reflections on the water.

868
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:17,080
Fly, Ricky, fly.

869
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:23,400
- Ricky!
- Ricky!

870
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:28,360
Ricky!
Ricky, come back!

871
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,360
Ricky!

872
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,680
Ricky!

873
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,840
Good evening, Mr. Sanchez.

874
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,880
Evening, Doctor.

875
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,640
Well?

876
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:34,080
They're searching for him
around the lake.

877
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,280
- Paco?
- Yes, Lisa?

878
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,520
Could a hunter shoot Ricky?

879
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,200
I hope not, honey.

880
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:41,320
Don't you worry.

881
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,920
Go see your mom;
she needs you.

882
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,280
Lisa's right.
What'll become of him?

883
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:57,800
He'll get attacked or starve.

884
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,920
This is all my fault.

885
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:03,080
She'll blame me forever.

886
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:06,360
Not if you stay together.

887
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,480
Miss.

888
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,200
Here.

889
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,160
Excuse me.

890
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:27,960
I saw you on TV.

891
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,280
You're the flying baby's dad.

892
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,480
That's me.

893
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,160
Want to make me
a flying baby too?

894
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,840
"Ricky Sanchez. Distinguishing
features: Two Wings."

895
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,520
Good, huh?

896
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:55,600
At work, they said
they'd take you back anytime.

897
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,560
Really?

898
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,320
With your experience.

899
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,560
Okay.

900
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,400
Seagulls.

901
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,320
What is it now?

902
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:04,240
I can't sleep.

903
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:07,560
Come back to bed.
It's Sunday.

904
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,760
I'm going for a walk.

905
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,880
Where now?

906
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,080
The lake.

907
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:31,560
Please, Katie,
pull yourself together.

908
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:37,080
You must accept
that Ricky's gone.

909
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:43,520
He's somewhere else now.

910
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,520
You think he's dead?

911
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:59,440
It's unlikely he survived.

912
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,360
Ricky?

913
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,720
My baby.

914
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:19,320
Ricky.

915
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:24,240
Ricky.
Ricky, my baby!

916
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,240
Don't go!

917
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:30,000
It's me, Mommy.

918
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,760
Do you recognize me?

919
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:35,120
Ricky, it's Mommy.

920
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:39,200
Easy, honey, easy.

921
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:42,800
Oh, my love.

922
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,280
How you've grown.

923
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:54,480
Your wings are so big,
and you can walk.

924
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:01,440
Are you okay?

925
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:03,400
You won't tell me?

926
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,840
You're mad at me.
Is that it?

927
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:12,760
I didn't want to leave you.

928
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:15,960
When I let the string go,
I didn't want to lose you.

929
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,680
But flying,
you were so beautiful.

930
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,960
So beautiful.

931
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,320
My Ricky.

932
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:03,760
Is that Mom?

933
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:05,520
She's got her keys.

934
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:10,240
I'll get it.

935
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:45,000
I forgot my keys.

936
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,200
Why are you soaked?

937
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:03,280
I love you.

938
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:24,800
# Once I wanted
to be the greatest #

939
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:27,360
# Greatest,
greatest, greatest #

940
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:34,400
# No wind or waterfall
could stall me #

941
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:39,600
# And then came the rush
of the flood #

942
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,800
# The stars at night
turned deep to dust #

943
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,720
Thank you.

944
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:49,520
# Melt me down
into big black armor #

945
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:52,960
- Hanging tight?
- Yeah.

946
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:57,320
# Leave no trace
of grace #

947
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:01,760
# Just in your honor #

948
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,560
# Lower me down #

949
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:07,080
# To culprit south #

950
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:10,920
# Make 'em watch
a space in town #

951
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,840
# For the lead
and the dregs of my bed #

952
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:18,680
# I've been sleeping #

953
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,440
# Lower me down #

954
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,200
# Pin me in #

955
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:27,120
# Secure the grounds #

956
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:30,440
# For the later parade #
