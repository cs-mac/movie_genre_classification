1
00:04:55,586 --> 00:05:00,007
Remember, the driver must
always see the big picture.

2
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,009
When driving through puddles
or in heavy rain,

3
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,386
your tires may begin
to hydroplane-

4
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,222
actually ride on the water
rather than the pavement.

5
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,182
If this happens to you,
don't panic

6
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,893
and especially don't
jam on your brakes.

7
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,313
In this actual
scientific demonstration,

8
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,732
we see that in as little
as a quarter inch of water,

9
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:20,235
your tires may lose contact
with the surface completely.

10
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,061
Does your brother have mono
or something?

11
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,854
He slept through
the entire course.

12
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,481
No.

13
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,649
He's just brain dead.

14
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,196
Mr. Anderson,

15
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,616
it's punks like you
that paramedics end up

16
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,202
scraping off the road
at 4:00 in the morning.

17
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,330
For your sake
and the safety of others,

18
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,625
I hope you fail
your driving exam.

19
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,645
Wait up!
Wait up, my bus!

20
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,254
You know, Dean,

21
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,757
is it ever
going to get that good for me?

22
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,469
Anderson, the only difference
between you and that greaseball

23
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,157
is that he has a license
and you don't.

24
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,183
Whoa whoa whoa!

25
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,145
Scumbag!

26
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,901
Get on.
I'll drive you home.

27
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,821
No way, man. Look, I have
a driver's exam to take Saturday.

28
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,281
I don't want to get killed.

29
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,368
Les, your license is just as important
to me as it is to you.

30
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,496
I'll take it easy.

31
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,165
Trust me.

32
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:41,334
Whoo whoo whoo!
Yeah!

33
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,212
Watch out, watch out!
Dean, Dean!

34
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,426
I'll get you, you little brat!

35
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,095
Ah, Dean!

36
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,855
Whoo! Ha ha!

37
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,691
Whoa!
Whoo-hoo!

38
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:12,240
There you go-
front-door service.

39
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,950
Great, thanks.

40
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,702
Wow.

41
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,538
Whose Caddy?
It's my grandfather's.

42
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,499
16 years old, man.

43
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,502
It only has 20,000 miles on it.

44
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,379
Wow, what's it doing here?

45
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,590
Well, my granddad's
afraid to take it on long trips,

46
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,967
so he borrowed my dad's car
for a week.

47
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:35,722
Do you know this boat
would kick ass up at Archie's?

48
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,267
Do you think there's any chance
we could get it Saturday night?

49
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,955
Not a chance in hell, Dean.
No way.

50
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,062
Hey, Dad, what's up?

51
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,647
Well, I'm just cleaning
out the garage here,

52
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,148
making some room
for the old boat.

53
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,691
What do you think, Dean?
As long as you're here,

54
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,360
you want to give us a hand, huh?
Yeah, Deano.

55
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,570
Dean?
You know, I'd love to, Mr. Anderson,

56
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,823
but I just remembered...

57
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,452
I'm allergic to dust
and cardboard boxes.

58
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,579
I gotta go.

59
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,667
See you tonight, Les.
See you tonight, Deano.

60
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,668
Take care of that cough, Dean.
Oh yeah!

61
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:05,835
Dad?
Yeah?

62
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,088
Do you think that there's any way
you could tell me for sure

63
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,936
if I could borrow Mom's car
Saturday night?

64
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,593
Here's the deal, Les-
first get your license, then we'll talk.

65
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,848
You want the broccoli?

66
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,601
Yes.
You want the broccoli.

67
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,479
All right, what nice happened
to who today?

68
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,940
What interesting news?

69
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,632
For your information,
this is exactly what I ate

70
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,969
when I was pregnant with all of you.
You turned out okay.

71
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,470
Dad?
Yeah?

72
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,640
Did you, um, look at
the brochure I gave you?

73
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,059
You bet.
What'd you think?

74
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:07,105
Well, a $23,000 BMW
for a 16-year-old kid

75
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,065
who's never had a job
a day in his life?

76
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,026
I think it's a great idea.

77
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,486
Look, Dad, the car
wouldn't only be for me.

78
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,531
I mean she can use it too.

79
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,825
Don't include me
in your obsession.

80
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:22,037
Les, isn't it premature to be talking
about getting a car?

81
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,664
You just finished your driver's ed
course two hours ago.

82
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:28,168
Karl says that in America
people are misled to believe

83
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,338
that a car represents
freedom and individuality.

84
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,797
Right.
When in essence,

85
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,925
it is more oppressive
than anything else,

86
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:39,054
burdening the individual
with such materialist costs as-

87
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,349
Wait, who cares what
your commie boyfriend thinks?

88
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,601
I see it's great
to be an American.

89
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,728
I agree.
Yes.

90
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,898
This is the most oppressive
environment a child could be raised in.

91
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,692
Natalie, one day soon
it will all be over.

92
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,194
You'll go away.

93
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,991
All right, I'm out of here.

94
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,535
Hey, buddy, down!

95
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,878
Come on!
Yo, Les, let's go!

96
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,383
Les, come on,
get your butt down here!

97
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,219
Les!

98
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,763
Get down here, Les.

99
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,227
Get out!
Out!

100
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,896
Right. I'll see you later.

101
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,904
Mom, what are you doing?

102
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,615
Wait. Duck down, duck down!
Mom! Mom!

103
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,159
No, don't stop here.
Go go.

104
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,412
Is something wrong
with the car, Dean?

105
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,747
No, it's not the car, it's you.
You're driving.

106
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,667
Please just go.
All right.

107
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,802
Thanks, Mom.
Drive safely.

108
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,222
Hey, dweebs! Does Mommy
hold your dicks when you piss?

109
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,563
I'm sorry, Mom, I didn't introduce you.
Those are my friends.

110
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,440
Oh, okay.
We'll call. Good night, Mom.

111
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,774
Good night.

112
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,286
Thanks, Mom.

113
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,955
Good night, honey.

114
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,832
Ignore him.
Bye, Mom!

115
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,876
Be careful!
Hey, guys!

116
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:37,088
Hey hey, guys.
Where are you going? Guys?

117
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,966
Hey, guys, it's me, Charles!

118
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,976
Oh baby.

119
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,854
Hey, do you ever wonder
what kind of car

120
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,315
some of these babes
would lose their virginity in?

121
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,734
You never cease
to amaze me, Deano.

122
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:01,654
No, seriously. Okay, look at
Cheryl Lieberman, for instance.

123
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,699
A VW convertible.

124
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,827
Cheryl Lieberman?
Trans Am.

125
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,497
Okay, Beth McLain.

126
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:14,292
A Volvo. No, wait wait.
A station wagon.

127
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,631
Okay, I got one for you-
Bonnie Dupa.

128
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,674
A cargo van.

129
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,551
A garbage truck.

130
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,227
Mercedes.

131
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:35,355
Mercedes Lane.

132
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,440
Oh, I've bumped into her
a million times.

133
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,359
She's never bumped into me once.

134
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,153
Come here.
No, listen, you don't own me.

135
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,822
Women have rights
in this country.

136
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,283
Not like Kuwait or Pakistan
where they worship their men.

137
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,911
Mercedes, it has nothing
to do with worship.

138
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,997
It has to do with going
to parties with kids.

139
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,083
I happen to go to school
with these kids.

140
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,293
I have friends here.
Friends, yes.

141
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,504
Friends, okay.
But this-this is children.

142
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,422
They can do nothing for you.

143
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,009
Mercedes,
I'm beginning to, um...

144
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,720
uh, perspire.

145
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,306
Now, you know
that I hate to perspire.

146
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,641
Now let us go, huh?

147
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,519
I think that I can find
my own way home, thank you.

148
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,396
Don't do this, Mercedes.

149
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,731
And Paolo, if you're wondering
about Saturday night,

150
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,359
I just remembered
I already have a date.

151
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,571
You have a date?
With who?

152
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,659
With him.
With me?

153
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,494
Didn't we make arrangements?

154
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:35,290
Yeah, I-
I believe so.

155
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,251
But nothing was final.

156
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,754
Well, now they're final.

157
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,924
Ciao.

158
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,887
Hey, watch it!

159
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,056
Thanks.

160
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,856
I can't believe Brian
dropped the ball.

161
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,858
Les, I have the answer.

162
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,152
Why don't you just ask
her to make sure?

163
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,279
Look, I'd love to, Charles,
but I can't talk to something

164
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,489
I can't see, right?
I mean, come on, guys.

165
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,783
Last night was the closest any
of us have ever been to her.

166
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,410
Well, you're in luck, lover boy,

167
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,163
'cause she's sitting down
right over there.

168
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,085
Wait, wait, Dean,
I can't do it, man.

169
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,754
Go on, ask her.

170
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,132
If you're lucky she'll bite.

171
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,849
Go for it!

172
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,104
Les!

173
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,190
Les?

174
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,984
Les?

175
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,115
Les, it's me, Papa.

176
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,161
Les, wait up.

177
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,913
Where you going?

178
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,957
Les.

179
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,500
Les, what's the matter?

180
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,543
Is there something wrong
with having a father these days?

181
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,213
Dad, what are you doing here?

182
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,757
I had to run some errands
for your mom after work

183
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,842
and I thought I'd stop by
and take you driving.

184
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,137
I figure if you can handle this cruiser,
you can handle anything.

185
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,597
What about Grandpa?

186
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,433
What about Grandpa? Who knows
what he's doing with my car?

187
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,061
Get in.
Yeah!

188
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,648
Uh, Dad, here comes a stop sign.
Nice call.

189
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,569
That's a good one.

190
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,656
Why don't we make a right turn
right here?

191
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,408
What?

192
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,619
Dad, I have to ask you for a favor
and you can say no,

193
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,831
but I will never ever ask you
for another favor as long as I live.

194
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,042
Les, you know that's a lie.

195
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,503
Okay, you see that girl
over there walking?

196
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,382
Dad, that is the girl
of my dreams.

197
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,302
Okay okay.
Let's give her a cruise.

198
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,306
Dad!
Dad, shh. Look.

199
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,559
She just asked me
out last night, Dad.

200
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,060
Yeah.
Okay?

201
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,855
Now if I drove by her

202
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,815
with you in the car with me-

203
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:09,068
no offense, it just wouldn't work.
You understand.

204
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,904
Les, you're asking me to let you
drive this car alone

205
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,906
without a license.
Are you crazy?

206
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,576
Dad, I'm just gonna go up to her,
circle around,

207
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,828
maybe at the least say hello to her
and come right back to you.

208
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,955
Two minutes.
I'll be careful, Dad.

209
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,125
Sure.
Thanks.

210
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,294
Be careful.
I will. I promise I will.

211
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,629
I trust you.
Thanks, Dad.

212
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,259
Oh, and Dad? Dad?
Yeah?

213
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,428
Would-would you mind?

214
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,233
Mercedes.

215
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,694
Mercedes?
Les Anderson

216
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,905
from the party last night?

217
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,617
Oh. Oh hi.

218
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,619
I'm sorry.
I didn't recognize you.

219
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,121
Hop in, I'll give you a lift.

220
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,167
Sure.
Hold on.

221
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,133
After you, madame.

222
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,817
Okay, so which house is yours?

223
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,027
Third one on the left.
Okay.

224
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,155
But I'm not going home.

225
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,825
Where are you going?

226
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,494
To a friend's house in Cedarwood.

227
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,621
You don't mind, do you?

228
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,006
Not at all.

229
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,471
Les?

230
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,516
Les?

231
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,184
Les!

232
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,270
Les!

233
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,148
Les!

234
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,116
Thanks a lot.

235
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,368
Wait wait.
Mercedes. Mercedes.

236
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,454
Last night at the party,

237
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,583
well, you kind of mentioned
something about, um...

238
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,210
me and you maybe going out
Saturday night.

239
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,963
Anyway, I was just wondering

240
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,716
if it was still on.

241
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,343
Sure, call me tomorrow.

242
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,346
Wait wait, let me give you my number
in case something comes up.

243
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:47,059
Here, write it on this.
Great.

244
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,897
Thanks a lot for the ride, Les.

245
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,984
No, um, problem.

246
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,841
How could you do it, Les?

247
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,928
What were you thinking about?
I don't believe it.

248
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:26,891
I mean, not only did you break
your explicit promise to me,

249
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,102
but you used up your last favor.

250
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,105
I suppose you know
where this leaves you, don't you?

251
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,858
Not in good shape?
That's right.

252
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,110
Look, Dad, just let me
explain it to you, okay?

253
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,780
Look, Dad, she told me that she
lived three houses down.

254
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,448
I thought I was taking her home.

255
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,367
Why didn't you just
tell her the truth?

256
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,327
Tell Mercedes Lane the truth

257
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,579
that Les Anderson
doesn't have a license?

258
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,747
Yes.

259
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,708
And risk her having a heart attack
from laughing so hard at me?

260
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,710
Her?
Her having a heart attack?

261
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,797
Look, Dad, please please
just put yourself in my shoes.

262
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,678
Look, you're upsetting
your mother.

263
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,097
She's pregnant, you know?

264
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,641
Do you understand what happens

265
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,643
if you get caught
driving without a license?

266
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,354
They make you wait two years
before you can take the test again.

267
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,274
That's 24 months.
That's an awful lot of bus rides.

268
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,001
Relax, Deano.
Look, I didn't get caught.

269
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:21,904
And you know what? You would have
done the exact same thing that I did.

270
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:25,324
Now did you guys come over here
to ask me some questions or what?

271
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,494
Ah, here's one.

272
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,706
"How can you identify
a blind pedestrian

273
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,000
to whom you must yield
the right of way?"

274
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,127
This is a complete waste of time.

275
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,963
I mean it's not like you just moved
here from Bedrock or something.

276
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,173
You've been a passenger
in a car all your life.

277
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,342
And what is this shit?

278
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,223
Natalie!

279
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,642
Hey, Natalie, I was wondering,

280
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,853
if you're driving
55 miles per hour

281
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,896
and you collide
with a runaway train,

282
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,774
would it make any improvements
on your face?

283
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,943
Aha ha ha!

284
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,367
Good luck on your exam
tomorrow, Einstein.

285
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,205
Good afternoon, children.

286
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:17,460
In the next 20 minutes,
you will be given 30 questions.

287
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:22,506
Anything over five mistakes
will be considered a failing grade.

288
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:26,802
We'll begin at the sound
of the bell.

289
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,972
Begin.

290
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:37,063
Welcome to the Department
of Motor Vehicles Drivers' Test.

291
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,273
Press start to begin.

292
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,941
Ha!
Question 1:

293
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,736
What should you do if you
miss your exit from an expressway?

294
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,697
Jam on the brakes and back up;

295
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,075
Make a quick U-turn;

296
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,535
Go on to the next one.

297
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,703
Correct.

298
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,497
Ha!

299
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,666
Which is usually
the smoothest lane of traffic?

300
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,961
Why don't they just
give licenses away?

301
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,589
Incorrect.

302
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,674
What?

303
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:10,805
Ahem.

304
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,432
You must look for bicycle riders

305
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,143
in the same lanes used by
motor vehicles because they

306
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,437
Must ride facing
oncoming traffic;

307
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,815
Are entitled to share
the road with you;

308
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,609
Always have the right of way.

309
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,783
Incorrect.

310
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,536
When driving through
fog or rain, it is advisable...

311
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,829
Question 9:

312
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,997
When backing out of
an angled parking place...

313
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,749
Incorrect.

314
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,127
Blink your turn signals regularly.
Continue looking through your...

315
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,894
Question 21...
turn on your headlights...

316
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,131
blow your horn...

317
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:48,676
shoulder and back slowly...
Stop.

318
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,512
Incorrect.

319
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,808
Warning. One more wrong
and you fail.

320
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,148
Finished.

321
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,818
Question 26:

322
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,155
At 55 miles per hour, you come
upon a large puddle of water.

323
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,866
Pump the brakes;

324
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:15,411
Gently ease your foot
off the gas pedal;

325
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,329
Accelerate?

326
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,592
Incorrect.

327
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,012
You have failed.

328
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,229
Damn!

329
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,567
- What's going on?
- Excuse me, but...

330
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,777
What about the test?

331
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:52,198
Mr. Anderson. Mr. Anderson.
Mr. Anderson.

332
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:53,991
Oh, Mr. Anderson.

333
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,369
You can thank your sister
for this one.

334
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,079
I can?
Uh-huh.

335
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,123
Due to a computer malfunction,

336
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,459
we are unable to search
the system's memory

337
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,586
for your test results.

338
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:09,465
However, since your sister
received a perfect score,

339
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:14,220
we are going to pass you
and allow you to take your road test.

340
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:21,769
I mean how different can you
and your twin sister actually be?

341
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,065
Wait a minute.

342
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,984
Stand back, children. Don't crowd me.
I'm a living time bomb.

343
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,914
Okay.
Hi.

344
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,879
Last name first,
first name last.

345
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,757
Anderson-Les Anderson.

346
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,635
Buckle up, son.
This is the real world out here.

347
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,763
Now, Anderson,

348
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,933
I want you to take
a long hard look

349
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,935
at this cup of coffee.

350
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,020
Now, I love my coffee.

351
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,231
It's probably the one thing
I truly do cherish

352
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,441
on this God-forsaken mudball
called Earth.

353
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,277
Now, what I'm trying to say

354
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:15,614
is that most examiners
use a clipboard.

355
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,157
I don't believe in 'em.

356
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:20,786
What I do believe in
is my cup of coffee.

357
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,834
Now that coffee's hot,
filled right to the brim.

358
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,124
If it spilled on me,
it'd probably burn me, huh?

359
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,500
Speak up, son!
Yeah yeah.

360
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,877
Nobody likes to get burned, do they?
No.

361
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,588
So it's real simple.

362
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,132
You burn me, you fail.

363
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,301
You don't, you pass.

364
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,303
It's as simple as that.

365
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,361
All right, Anderson,

366
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:57,573
let's start off
with some light traffic.

367
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,794
Now I want you
to get over in that lane. Now.

368
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:21,013
Very good, Natalie.

369
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,183
Now why don't you
head up to the left here?

370
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,355
Let's see how you
handle this hill.

371
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,900
Very good.

372
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,612
Anderson, let's pull
to a stop right here.

373
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,155
Here?

374
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,041
What the heck's wrong with him?

375
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,752
Every time I come up this road,
there's some idiot kid.

376
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,629
Come on, you little moron.

377
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,397
What are you waiting for,
son, Christmas?

378
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,967
I have a strobe light for you
to get that thing moving.

379
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,058
Ha ha!

380
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:10,187
Okay, Natalie, I'd like you
stop right next to this car here.

381
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,440
Good.

382
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:16,443
Now why don't you
parallel park right here?

383
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,908
Very, very, very good.

384
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,915
Okay, Anderson, I want you to
make a parallel park right in here.

385
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,167
In there?
What am I, speaking Greek?

386
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,460
In here.

387
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,433
Ha!

388
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,563
Congratulations,
here's your license.

389
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,858
Please drive safely.
Thanks.

390
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,985
Good morning, how are you?
Lousy.

391
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:04,700
I got it! I got it!

392
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,410
Slow down.

393
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,255
You're in luck, Anderson.

394
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,717
The cup was empty.

395
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,930
See you on
the battlefield sometime, soldier.

396
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,144
Congratulations.
Here's your license.

397
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,813
And please drive safely.

398
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:39,651
Uh, Mr. Anderson,
just a minute.

399
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,905
Someone wants to speak with you.

400
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,180
Well, Mr. Anderson,

401
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:12,559
we were able to retrieve your test
results from the computer.

402
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,895
And I suppose you already know,

403
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,314
you failed.

404
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:21,902
God giveth
and the DMV taketh away.

405
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:26,532
You mustn't fuck with the Department
of Motor Vehicles, Mr. Anderson.

406
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:29,451
We can make your life
a living hell.

407
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:34,206
Next.

408
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,093
- Hi!
- Hi, we're home.

409
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,263
Where's Les?
Where is everybody?

410
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,809
Please, we'll keep the classic-
Yeah, no.

411
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,895
Mom? Dad?
Yeah, in here.

412
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,646
In here. Shh.

413
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,316
Mom, Dad? Hi.

414
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,818
Yeah. Hi, sport.
What's the good word?

415
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,613
Um...

416
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,532
I have to tell you
guys something.

417
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,119
Oh no, you put a dent
in the car already, huh?

418
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,163
What is it, honey?

419
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:01,668
Um...

420
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:04,463
I-
What?

421
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:08,592
What?
Oh, mmm.

422
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:13,889
Yes.
Yay!

423
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,933
Congratulations.
Thank you.

424
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,310
So tell me about it.
Was it murder? Was it tough?

425
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:21,563
Murder? No, not at all, Dad.
It was like taking candy from a baby.

426
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:25,651
That's great. Look, I filled
your mom's car up with some gas

427
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,320
just in case you felt like
taking it for a little spin.

428
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,364
Oh, how sweet.
Huh?

429
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:33,617
Well, Dad, I was kind of thinking
about maybe going to my room

430
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,661
and taking a little nap.
I'm exhausted.

431
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,704
Honey, what is wrong with you?
Say, "Ahhh!"

432
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:40,123
Mom, come on,
what could be wrong with me?

433
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,250
This is the greatest day of my life.
I know.

434
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,670
So why don't you want to take
advantage of your father's senility

435
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,338
and take my car out
for a little spin?

436
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,340
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

437
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,717
I don't know if you guys
remember or not,

438
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:54,972
but 16 years of waiting
and dreaming is a lot of pressure.

439
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,517
And I'm not sure that
being behind the wheel of a car

440
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,325
is the right place for me
to be right now.

441
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,025
Hello?

442
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:10,112
Did you hear that?
You did it, man. How does it feel?

443
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,030
Dean, baby.
Hey, what's going on?

444
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:15,450
Hold on a second,
I'm looking for my car keys.

445
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:18,120
Found 'em right here
next to my AAA card.

446
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,414
Great. Now come over
and pick us up.

447
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:23,542
Uh, I can't.

448
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,627
Of course you can.
You can do anything, Les.

449
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:26,915
You have a license.
What?

450
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,797
See that, Dean?
My mom's calling me.

451
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,465
They're already asking me
to run errands. I have to go.

452
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,884
Okay? Goodbye.

453
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,696
"Test failed"?

454
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,783
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
Robert?

455
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,748
All right, Mercedes!
Ha ha! Yeah.

456
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,083
Well, you know.
Lower it, lower it. It's ringing.

457
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,085
Lower it.
Come here.

458
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,839
Hello?

459
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,341
Rudy, Mom's got brownies
in the kitchen.

460
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,343
Go, hurry. Quick quick quick.
But-

461
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:18,138
Dad, what do you need?
Les, my boy,

462
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:22,100
we're drinking a toast to you.

463
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,770
Hello? Hello?

464
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:27,189
Hello?

465
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,816
Dad, you know,
that's really thoughtful of you,

466
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,402
but you know I shouldn't be
drinking and driving.

467
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,613
I know that, Les.
I know that.

468
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:39,367
Have a drink.
You just saved me $26,000.

469
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,036
What?

470
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,413
First raise your glass.

471
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:47,000
To saving me
26,000 buckaroonies.

472
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,211
Huh?
How'd I do that, Dad?

473
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,546
It's simple-
$23,000 for the BMW,

474
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,799
$3,000 for the insurance.

475
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,801
I don't get it.
No?

476
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,178
No.
Get it?

477
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,890
He failed?

478
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,393
He failed and he lied.

479
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,813
Look, Dad,

480
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,190
I just figured that I could
get through the weekend

481
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,878
and then take it over Monday,
you know?

482
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,944
I know what you figured.

483
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:18,448
Listen, you're grounded
for two weeks.

484
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,243
It's not the end of the world.

485
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,746
Feels like it.

486
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,503
Good evening, Karl.
Good evening, Mrs. Anderson.

487
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:32,879
Is Natasha at home?

488
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,132
She'll be down in a second.

489
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,467
How are you feeling?
Fine, fine.

490
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,137
Fine, thank you.
I admire you.

491
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,098
I really admire
you for having the courage

492
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,642
to bring a child
into this oppressive world.

493
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,812
And let me just say-
Natalie!

494
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,856
Hmm.

495
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:54,401
Natasha, we're going to a protest.

496
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:58,029
Do we have to take your mother's
imperialist gas-guzzler?

497
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:01,283
Would you rather take
my grandfather's Cadillac?

498
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,458
Hello?

499
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,418
Hi, is Les in, please?

500
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,794
Yeah, this is Les.

501
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,922
Hi, this is Mercedes.

502
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,424
Do you remember me?

503
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,093
Remember you? Yeah, of course.
Hi. How are you?

504
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,304
Actually I'm a little lonely.

505
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,265
I thought that we had
a date tonight

506
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,018
and I figured I'd call you
since you hadn't called me.

507
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:13,188
Oh, um...
well, I was out all day.

508
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,233
I was, um, deep-sea fishing.

509
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,778
So you haven't changed your mind
about tonight, have you?

510
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,739
Tonight? Now?

511
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,990
No.

512
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:27,077
Great. So you can pick me up
in 20 minutes?

513
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,083
Les?
Hang on.

514
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,898
An innocent girl,
a harmless drive-

515
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,651
what could possibly go wrong?

516
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,907
Mercedes?

517
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,201
I'll be there in half an hour.

518
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,867
Oh man.

519
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,703
No, no, no.

520
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,708
No, no, not the bush.

521
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,186
God.

522
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,275
Oh.

523
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,778
Ah, shit.

524
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:56,309
Oh. Ow.

525
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:59,562
Oh. Hmm.

526
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,314
Hmm.

527
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,400
Hmmm.

528
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,950
Don't worry, Robert.
It was nothing. Go back to sleep.

529
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,744
Mmm, that's nice.

530
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,187
Let's go.

531
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,687
Thank you.
Take good care of my car, pal.

532
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,023
Yes sir.

533
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,533
Come on, man, open up.
Let's go.

534
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,202
Open the door, Les.
Come on, man, I don't have all night.

535
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,703
Did you see that?

536
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,152
If I let him park my car,
he's gonna ruin my transmission.

537
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,874
No way.
Hey!

538
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,127
Hey, what about my tip?

539
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:51,799
Here we are.

540
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,596
Wait, we can't park here.
It's a tow-away zone.

541
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:57,972
On a Saturday night?

542
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,267
Les, you're acting like
it's the first time you've ever driven.

543
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,869
Hey, baby.
Hi.

544
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,955
Hey hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you going?

545
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,706
I'm with her.

546
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:27,001
You wouldn't be with her
if she was your Siamese twin.

547
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,962
Lose yourself, kid.
Mercedes.

548
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,093
Hi.

549
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:38,137
Nice to see you.
How are you?

550
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,769
Yeah, baby, that's cool.

551
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,312
Damn it.

552
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,568
Paolo.
Mercedes.

553
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,444
What a lovely surprise
it is to see you.

554
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,071
Paolo, I have to talk to you.

555
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,365
By the way, this is Veronique.

556
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,742
She's going to be
moving in with me.

557
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,995
Is this the one you told me about?

558
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,455
Mmm.
Would you like a drink?

559
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,874
Paulie, give her a drink.
What are you having?

560
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,543
Nothing.

561
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,969
Hey!
Mercedes.

562
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:21,639
Hey, hey, are you okay?

563
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:25,184
Oh, my God.
My car!

564
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,731
Whoa! Jesus!

565
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,691
Wait, wait!

566
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,027
Wait, hold up!

567
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:36,279
Get off my truck, boy!

568
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,741
Look, mister, you can't do this
to my car.

569
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,492
Boy, I've driven with deer,

570
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,995
antelope, even bear
strapped to that bumper.

571
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:46,497
Ain't no 65-pound sack
of fly shit like you

572
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,166
gonna shake me
a hell of difference.

573
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,210
Look, I'll pay you.
I'll give you everything I've got.

574
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,838
Ah!

575
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,678
Just how much you talkin' about?

576
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,560
Please, sir, be gentle.

577
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:11,022
For 80 bucks?

578
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,155
80 bucks?

579
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,209
Would you like some champagne?

580
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:32,627
It might help.

581
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:35,254
No thanks.
I already had some tonight.

582
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:40,093
I'm really sorry about the car.

583
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,970
I feel like it was all my fault.
Oh, don't be silly.

584
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:46,015
I should have given the car
to the valet in the first place.

585
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,518
I'm sorry about your friend.

586
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,353
Oh, he was a jerk anyways.

587
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,397
I don't know why
I even hung around him.

588
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,652
Let's get out of here.
And go where?

589
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,946
I mean with the amount
of money I have in my pocket,

590
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,906
we have two choices:

591
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:05,159
we can either sit in front
of a parking meter for 20 minutes

592
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:07,912
or go buy ourselves a newspaper.

593
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:15,294
Let me tell you, I know a quiet spot
with plenty of free parking.

594
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:28,141
Are you sure
there's a road here?

595
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,769
God.

596
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,668
Hey, it's amazing up here.

597
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,629
How'd you ever find this place?

598
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,507
Someone I know
used to take me here.

599
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:07,638
Not a boyfriend.
My father used to take me here

600
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:10,850
to show me how beautiful
the world could be

601
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,811
if you could step away
and see it at a distance.

602
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,484
I haven't been here
in a long time.

603
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:21,819
No no no, not on the car.

604
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:24,947
I mean, I'll get you a blanket.

605
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,783
You sure come prepared.

606
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,409
Like a Boy Scout.

607
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,495
Les?
Yes?

608
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:33,039
I'm sorry I dragged you
into all this.

609
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:36,334
I don't usually act like this.

610
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:39,045
No, it's okay.
I don't mind.

611
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,883
Here you go.

612
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,305
I'm really glad
I called you tonight.

613
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:53,559
Yeah? I'm-
I'm really glad too.

614
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:58,356
All we're missing now
is some soft romantic music.

615
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,399
Hold on.

616
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,041
Oh, man.

617
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,591
Oh great, Grandpa's top 10.

618
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:37,812
Ugh.

619
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:45,319
Wait.
Aren't you drinking rather heavily?

620
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,120
To this?
Uh, yeah. Where?

621
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:57,623
Right up here. You couldn't pray
for a more romantic setting.

622
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,794
Yeah, I guess so.

623
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,147
Maybe I should
take my shoes off.

624
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,149
Yeah, good idea.

625
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:52,428
Get up! Get off!

626
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,680
Get off the car!
What's the matter, Les?

627
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,724
The hood, it's caving off.
Get off quick.

628
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,392
But, Les, I love this song.

629
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,760
Yeah, well then you've definitely
had too much to drink.

630
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:04,440
Come on, get off.

631
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,776
Wow, stay here.

632
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,494
Come on, get in.

633
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:17,995
Oh.
Shh.

634
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:20,706
Look, we've got to get this
thing fixed. Slide over.

635
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,920
Mercedes, please.

636
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:31,008
You have such baby soft skin.

637
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,593
Oh, yeah.

638
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,754
Don't worry
about the noise, man.

639
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,486
My parents are vampires.

640
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,155
And I'll tell you something-
you have balls.

641
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:56,075
You definitely have balls
for snagging this car.

642
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,828
I'm impressed.

643
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,455
All right, Les,
let's see the license.

644
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,749
No way.
Forget it, guys, it's ugly.

645
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,919
Of course it is. Big deal.
Come on, Les.

646
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,255
No way.
Please let me take a picture of it.

647
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,589
Forget it.

648
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,383
Don't you think he should
let me take a picture of it?

649
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,802
Okay, Charles, okay.
All right.

650
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,430
Say cheese.
Cheese.

651
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,266
Great.

652
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:25,604
Well, take a look, Les.
What do you think?

653
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,648
Excellent work, Dean.
Thank you.

654
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,859
I mean, this is spectacular.

655
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,028
You saved me, man.
Thanks.

656
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:37,700
So I guess we can go
to Archie's now?

657
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:41,579
Look, Deano, pal,
I promise you next weekend, yeah.

658
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,707
Fine okay, we can go to Archie's.
But not tonight.

659
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,208
Look, Mercedes doesn't have to be
home for a couple hours.

660
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,919
Les, let me explain
something to you here.

661
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:51,130
Unless you're into some
intense kinky shit,

662
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,798
and you never know after tonight,

663
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:55,968
this Mercedes has a dead battery.

664
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:01,515
Les, we're talking about
Archie's Atomic here, Les.

665
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:04,403
You can't get there without a license.
It's in the middle of nowhere.

666
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,228
No buses, no trains, no planes.

667
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:09,315
Only the slickest,
most intense driving machines

668
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,150
you've ever seen in your life.

669
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:15,154
I have the directions my brother
gave me in my back pocket.

670
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,698
You won't regret this.
There's five girls for every guy.

671
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:20,242
And we're not talking dogs,
we're talking bunnies.

672
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,744
Dean, did you wipe your feet off?

673
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,246
Yes, I wiped the concrete
off my feet.

674
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:29,001
Hey, Charles, push in the lighter.
I got a surprise for everybody.

675
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,212
No way, man.
Not in here. Nuh-uh.

676
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:32,505
What's the matter with you, Les?

677
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:35,007
This is a car,
it's not an oxygen tent.

678
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:38,015
Look, Dean, if there's any evidence
at all that I took this car tonight,

679
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:40,930
my dad's going to slaughter me first
and ask questions later, okay?

680
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,807
What?
Stop it.

681
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,489
Hey, Les, this is great and all,

682
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,366
but could you take the car
out of neutral?

683
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,701
We just got passed
by a street sweeper.

684
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:13,337
Hey, girls, whose car
are you driving, Grandma's?

685
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,172
Come on, race 'em.

686
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,383
Yeah, mess with
the faggots, man.

687
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:22,012
Get that-

688
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:35,901
Go!

689
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:41,657
Les, what's the matter with you?

690
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,576
Are you 16 or 60?

691
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:46,078
I mean you could have given
those gearheads a run for their money.

692
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,247
Look, Dean,
this is my grandfather's car.

693
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,055
I tell you what-give me a car
that I'm not genetically related to,

694
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:52,626
I promise things
will change, okay?

695
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:55,045
Honey!
What? Okay!

696
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,506
Okay okay.
Okay, I'm coming.

697
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:00,301
Do your breathing.

698
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:01,760
Okay.

699
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,387
Is it hot in here?

700
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:05,598
Is it hot or is it just me?

701
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:07,183
Hot?

702
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,186
It's like a sauna in here. Oh.

703
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,688
Want me to go down to the garage
and turn on the air conditioning?

704
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,148
No, that's okay.

705
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,275
I like to just sit here and sweat.

706
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,986
I'll go down and turn on
the air conditioning.

707
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,121
Hmm?

708
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:49,975
Hmm?

709
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:52,102
Hey, Robert?

710
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,855
Robert?

711
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:56,482
Yes?

712
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:59,026
I'm not hot anymore, I'm hungry.

713
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,654
Will you make me
a sandwich, please?

714
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:03,155
Okay, honey.

715
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,408
Sardines and pickles, okay?

716
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:52,997
You asshole, do up her shirt!

717
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:55,624
No way, Les, forget about it.
I mean look at us-

718
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,751
we're three wild animals
bombing down the highway

719
00:54:57,919 --> 00:55:00,379
with the cruise control
set at 55 miles per hour.

720
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,298
I don't need a ticket
on my first night out.

721
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,425
God damn it, stop that.

722
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:06,468
And what is this crap
we're listening to?

723
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:09,054
I mean my parents don't even
listen to this stuff.

724
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:11,223
All right, that's enough.

725
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:12,711
Dean, give me that camera.
No!

726
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:13,809
Give me it.
No.

727
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,353
God damn it, Dean,
it's not your camera.

728
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:17,896
Give me the camera.
No, no!

729
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,064
Guys?
Give me it.

730
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:20,858
No, no!
Give me it.

731
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:23,569
Jesus.
Watch out!

732
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:33,245
Oh, we're gonna die.

733
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,247
Man, I told you
this was gonna happen.

734
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,583
Shit!

735
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:50,179
Oh!
Les, stop the car.

736
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:53,515
Uh-oh.

737
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,954
I think I'm gonna throw up.

738
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,959
Get her out of the car quick.
Help!

739
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:23,962
Help!
Help, get her off of me.

740
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,530
Not in the car, please.
I'm trapped.

741
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,049
Not in the car.

742
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,720
Hoo!

743
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,972
Les, I apologize for everything,

744
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,974
but that ride was definitely
worth the price of admission.

745
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:38,268
I mean that makes up
for a whole life of boredom.

746
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,646
There's a scratch on my car.

747
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,524
Where?

748
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:46,944
Right there! Right here
there's a big old scratch on my car.

749
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,912
Hold on, let me see.
My dad's gonna murder me.

750
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,948
Look at this.
There is no scratch on your car.

751
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:53,325
There is a scratch, Dean.
A teeny little scratch.

752
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,160
Your dad is not going
to see that scratch.

753
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,371
Your dad's a 40-year old guy
who wears glasses,

754
00:56:57,539 --> 00:57:00,499
not an eagle, okay?
Now listen to me.

755
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,293
We are two seconds away from
Archie's, do you understand that?

756
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:04,461
Deano, you listen to me.
Two seconds-

757
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:07,423
Two seconds or not two seconds,
watch my lips.

758
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:08,841
We're not going to Archie's.

759
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:11,168
We're not driving
in my grandfather's Cadillac anymore.

760
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,846
We are, in fact,
going home, okay?

761
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,848
No, it's not okay!
Look at this-

762
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:18,767
You don't look too good.

763
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,686
We cannot turn around now!

764
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,604
We'd better get you a soda.

765
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:26,650
You have worked really hard

766
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,360
for that license in your wallet.

767
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:32,489
I mean, you have had 16 years
of humiliation,

768
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:35,868
begging for lifts from people who
couldn't give a shit about your image.

769
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:38,745
Les, you've had
to stand and watch

770
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:42,124
as all the pretty girls drove off
in some older jerk's car.

771
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,293
Humiliation-I know.
I've been through it.

772
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,253
But that's all over now.

773
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:49,715
Les, that thing in your wallet,

774
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:51,717
that's no ordinary
piece of paper.

775
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,510
That is a driver's license.

776
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,762
And it's not only
a driver's license,

777
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,931
it's an automobile license.

778
00:57:58,099 --> 00:57:59,892
And it's not only
an automobile license,

779
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:03,270
it is a license to live,
a license to be free,

780
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:06,023
to go-to go
wherever, whenever,

781
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:08,567
and with whomever you choose.

782
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,789
Archie's, man.
Let's do it.

783
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:24,625
Deano, I don't know.

784
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:27,544
Les, to live in fear

785
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:30,297
is not to live at all.

786
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,137
What about Mercedes?

787
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:41,099
I don't think that this
is such a good idea, okay?

788
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:42,559
Of course it's a good idea.

789
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:44,770
In half an hour,
there's gonna be babes all over us.

790
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:48,190
She'll kill it for us.

791
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:54,196
Wow. Did you ever imagine
in all your life

792
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,699
that you would see a Mercedes
fit inside the trunk of a Cadillac?

793
00:58:57,867 --> 00:59:00,202
Look, I feel bad about this.

794
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,204
You feel bad for her?

795
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:05,791
I mean, this trunk is bigger
than the size of my bedroom.

796
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,626
Let's go.

797
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,714
Nighty night.

798
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,506
Whoo!

799
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,049
Oh, honey.
Oh, babe.

800
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:57,884
I love you!

801
00:59:58,052 --> 01:00:00,762
Hey, eyes front.
Whoo-hoo!

802
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:04,641
Look at her.

803
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:07,269
Whoa, hey, come back here.

804
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:17,946
Hi.

805
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,409
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, guys. Hey, guys?

806
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,994
Wait-wait up for a second.

807
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,871
Hey don't you guys
go get some dinner?

808
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,205
I'm gonna get dessert.

809
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:29,541
All right?
Go, go, go, go, go.

810
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,002
Hi.

811
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,063
Here you go.

812
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:53,440
Thank you.

813
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,360
Guys, it's all set up.

814
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:57,819
I took care of everything.

815
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:00,697
They're gonna be here in a few minutes.
There's one for each of us.

816
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:04,159
Dean, I will never doubt you again.
I know you won't!

817
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,911
My dreams never get this good.

818
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,913
My fantasies never
get this good, man.

819
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:10,248
And this is only the beginning.

820
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:11,917
Whoo!
Whoo!

821
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:13,877
Yeah, let's eat.

822
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:25,430
Sorry.

823
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:27,099
Quick, roll up the windows.

824
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:29,142
Those assholes again.

825
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,938
Charles, you spazticated idiot!

826
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,648
It was an accident.

827
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,608
Roll up the windows.

828
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:39,903
Hey, my hamburger.
Hey, give me my hamburger.

829
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:41,863
Ow! Ow, ow!

830
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,711
Roll the window down.
No, keep it up.

831
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,575
No, roll it down.
No, keep it up.

832
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:48,453
Hey, come here.

833
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:50,997
Hi.

834
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:54,126
God damn it!

835
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:56,173
Wait, you can't leave now.
What about the girls?

836
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:58,012
Dean, there's a maniac
on the hood of the car.

837
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,211
Get us out of here!
Don't worry about the maniac.

838
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:04,052
Oh, shit.

839
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,276
Archie's! Come back.

840
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,528
Come back.

841
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:25,073
Come back!

842
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:27,617
I'm standing outside

843
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:29,661
the gates of Allied Technology

844
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,122
where a group of peaceful
protesters are gathered

845
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,166
to demonstrate against
the late-night transportation

846
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:36,251
of military hardware
through our city streets.

847
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,421
Now, Jim, as you can see,
there's a wide range of people here...

848
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,548
Karl! I don't know.
I don't know.

849
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:44,092
I don't think this is such a good idea.
Can we go home?

850
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,719
Look, Dean, we're going home.

851
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,180
And if you don't like it,
you can jump out right here,

852
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:49,848
wherever the hell we are.

853
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:57,314
Hey, that looks like
my mom's Audi.

854
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:10,368
Holy shit!
I think we're being invaded.

855
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:14,748
Here they come!

856
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,812
- Karl!
- This is an illegal assembly.

857
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:19,294
Come on!

858
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,422
You will be arrested

859
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:23,147
if you do not disperse the area.
Hey.

860
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:25,550
No, no, no, not on my car.
What are you doing?

861
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:29,471
My car! My car!

862
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,931
Hey, I know that guy.

863
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:33,016
He looks like
my sister's boyfriend.

864
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,851
Les?

865
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:36,561
Shit, my sister! Duck.

866
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:39,564
What are you doing?
Natalie, don't tell Dad on me!

867
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:41,612
I'll do anything.
You don't even have a license.

868
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:43,318
Natalie, don't-don't tell Dad.

869
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:45,612
All right,
let's round these people up.

870
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,739
Put them in the wagon.

871
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:49,574
Excuse me.

872
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:52,536
Shit.

873
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:54,371
As you can see behind me,

874
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:56,248
what started as
a peaceful protest

875
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,542
has now mushroomed into
a substantial demonstration.

876
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:02,254
It seems that tempers flared when
executives from Allied Technologies

877
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:03,964
refused to speak to rep-

878
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:10,136
Oh, my God.
What the hell was going on back there?

879
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:12,055
I don't know, man,
but Les, I'll tell you something-

880
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:13,932
this Caddy sure can
take a beating.

881
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,725
Yeah, well, not half the beating
you're going to get

882
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:17,686
unless you clam up, Dean.

883
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:26,820
Oh, this is great.
This is real classic.

884
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:28,908
They must be
checking for drunk drivers.

885
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:30,282
Yeah, no shit.

886
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:33,577
Don't sweat it.
Think of your license as a credit card.

887
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:36,288
Sooner or later
you gotta break it in.

888
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:38,290
Pull over to the curb,
right over there.

889
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:40,333
And besides, Les,
what are you worried about?

890
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:43,503
We're sober. They're here to catch
drunks like that dick.

891
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:46,590
Have you had anything to drink
tonight, sir?

892
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:49,217
Take it easy.

893
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:51,011
License and registration.

894
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:57,684
License and registration, son.

895
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:02,814
Um, sir,
I forgot my license at home.

896
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:06,985
But, um, I could give you this.

897
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,703
All right, sit tight.

898
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,789
Why didn't you show him
your license?

899
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:22,834
What was that thing you flashed
in front of us at the house?

900
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,920
My school ID.

901
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,922
Are you telling us
that you left the house

902
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:30,300
on your first night out with
a license without a license?

903
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:32,928
No, Dean,
I'm not telling you that.

904
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,555
Ilook, guys,

905
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:38,600
I failed my exam.

906
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,185
You what?

907
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,519
Proper grammar is-

908
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:43,271
This punk doesn't even
have a license.

909
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,607
All right, sir,
what I'd like you to do

910
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,401
is I'd like you to try
to walk this line here, all right?

911
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:50,320
All right.
Come here.

912
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,697
You just keep walking, all right?
I'll be right back.

913
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:55,533
We may have to call a wagon
to pick this guy up.

914
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:57,327
This is gonna go on our records.

915
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:58,815
We're gonna be
locked up in a cell

916
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,705
with men who have
murdered and raped

917
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:02,540
and robbed convenience stores.

918
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:05,710
Will you take a pill or something?
Will you just relax?

919
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:09,339
Nothing's going to happen to us.
We're juveniles.

920
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,051
Nice call, Dean.

921
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:15,720
All right, Anderson,
let's have a look inside the trunk.

922
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:22,352
Come on, I ain't got all night.

923
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,145
Come on, come on.

924
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,653
Hi, how you doin'?

925
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:34,739
What the hell is this?

926
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:36,992
My date?

927
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:43,915
We gotta roll. There's a riot
going on at Allied Tech.

928
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:47,836
You just got lucky, pal.

929
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:52,424
Let's go.

930
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,929
Excuse me, officers?
Yes! Perfect! Yes.

931
01:06:58,097 --> 01:07:00,265
See, Les, what'd I tell you?
Piece of cake.

932
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,183
Deano, shut up, huh?
Help me with her.

933
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:04,811
Do something useful in life,
would you?

934
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:08,189
Oh, looks like a line.
Oh yeah.

935
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:13,111
Oh, a Maserati.

936
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:16,614
Oh, this is much
nicer than mine.

937
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:18,783
Keys?

938
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:21,953
This chick is no paperweight.

939
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:23,621
So where's our next stop?

940
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:26,041
There are no stops, Dean.
We're going home.

941
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,384
Oh, I'm dead.

942
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:39,304
I'm so dead they're gonna
have to bury me twice.

943
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:40,847
Let's go.

944
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:48,897
You can't take this car!

945
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,483
Yeah, well, he took our car.
We're gonna take his.

946
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:58,782
And go.
What a waste.

947
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:01,910
Oh, I'm swinging!

948
01:08:03,287 --> 01:08:04,996
Go, go!

949
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:18,384
Where the hell am I?

950
01:08:18,552 --> 01:08:20,872
He's going left. He's going left.
I see him. I see him.

951
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:26,017
Whoa!

952
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:31,856
Where the hell
is this guy going?

953
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:35,693
Yeah, go, Sammy!

954
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:42,033
Oh, oh!

955
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:44,828
Shit.
Don't worry about it.

956
01:08:44,995 --> 01:08:46,704
I can fix that.
It's only the right side.

957
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,769
My life's no bed of roses,
that's for sure.

958
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:12,897
People are the problem.
People pushing me around!

959
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:15,585
I don't care what you say to the guy,
just get him to pull over.

960
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:17,569
The man is a drunk lunatic.

961
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:19,779
Don't you think this is
a little bit dangerous?

962
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:21,307
You're telling me about dangerous?

963
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,087
Charles, you want to know
what's dangerous?

964
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:25,243
Me going home
and having to explain to my father

965
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,954
that this piece of shit
is my grandfather's Cadillac.

966
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:31,499
Now, Charles, here he is
and you'd better talk to him.

967
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:34,711
Be tough!
Excuse me, sir?

968
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:37,297
Sir, pardon me.
Excuse me.

969
01:09:37,464 --> 01:09:39,757
I believe there's been
a slight mix-up here.

970
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:43,219
It seems you've mistakenly
driven off with our car.

971
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:45,597
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

972
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:48,141
- You're very kind.
- What the hell?

973
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:50,935
Come on! Get the juicehead
to pull over.

974
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:53,479
Sir?

975
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:01,988
Les, he just vomited
in your car.

976
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:03,823
Oh.

977
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:08,995
Oh shit.

978
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:18,296
Whoo!
What airline is this?

979
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:21,299
Come on, go!
Yeah, come on.

980
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:22,467
Shut up, Deano.

981
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:25,511
Hey, check it out-spongehead
is actually driving straight.

982
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,388
What did he do, sober up?

983
01:10:32,144 --> 01:10:34,604
Holy shit!
He's out cold.

984
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:36,105
Oh, shit.

985
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:40,985
Charles, you take the gas.
Deano, you take the wheel.

986
01:10:41,153 --> 01:10:43,321
I'm going out there.
No, no, wait a minute. No, no.

987
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:46,491
Les, it's just a car!
You try telling that to my father.

988
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,493
Les.
Be careful, Les.

989
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:50,328
Hold it steady.
Wait a minute, Les!

990
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,247
Dean, hold the car steady.

991
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:53,665
Come on.

992
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:56,209
Keep it straight, would you?

993
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:00,755
Shit.

994
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:03,549
Stop it!
You're losing control.

995
01:11:03,717 --> 01:11:05,343
Les! Wait a minute, wait.

996
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:08,471
Whoa! Whoa!

997
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:11,724
I'm gonna fall.
Deano, wait a minute.

998
01:11:11,892 --> 01:11:14,018
Holy shit!
Shit! Whoa!

999
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:16,271
Deano, whoa!

1000
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:20,024
Mister, wake up, would you?

1001
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:21,192
Come on.

1002
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,528
Wake up.
Please, wake up.

1003
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:26,406
Will you get your hands
off the God damn-

1004
01:11:26,573 --> 01:11:27,865
Shit.

1005
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:31,369
Whoa! Deano, help.

1006
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:34,706
We're losing him. Look.

1007
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:36,582
Hi, Les.

1008
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:39,627
Stop it, Dean!

1009
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:47,176
God, I hate drunk drivers.

1010
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:51,889
What?

1011
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:54,225
No! No!

1012
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,227
Watch the road, come on.

1013
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,898
Oh, shit!

1014
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:05,194
No! No!

1015
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:09,163
Come on, get out of the car!
Stop stepping on my face!

1016
01:13:09,259 --> 01:13:11,511
Hey, will you stop complaining?
Oh, you're alive!

1017
01:13:11,678 --> 01:13:13,554
We thought you were dead.
Oh, my God.

1018
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:15,807
Did you see what you did?
Did you see what you did?

1019
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:17,767
Honey, I'm home.

1020
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:19,852
Who is this guy?
I don't know.

1021
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:21,479
Who are you?

1022
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:24,315
Well, my friend, you're a little thief.
Give me those keys.

1023
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:27,819
Yes, yes, but see, friends
don't let friends drive drunk.

1024
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:30,988
You call yourself a friend?

1025
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:33,366
Wait, look, you were incredible.

1026
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:34,951
You are an animal.

1027
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:36,786
I mean nobody's
going to believe this.

1028
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:40,665
Yeah, not too bad for a kid
without his license, huh?

1029
01:13:59,476 --> 01:14:01,394
Les, I gotta tell you,

1030
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:03,146
license or no license,

1031
01:14:03,313 --> 01:14:06,065
that was one intense display
of driving.

1032
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:09,652
Yeah, and as far as a first night out
on the town with a car is concerned,

1033
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:12,196
that one definitely
sets the standard.

1034
01:14:12,364 --> 01:14:14,699
Hey, thank God you don't get your
license for a couple months, buddy.

1035
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:17,201
What are you going
to tell Sleeping Beauty?

1036
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:20,997
I don't know.

1037
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:23,374
Shh. Go, go.

1038
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:25,001
Good night, Les.

1039
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:27,837
See you later, Les.

1040
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,150
Robert.
Hmm?

1041
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,943
This is it.

1042
01:14:51,111 --> 01:14:52,987
That's nice, honey.

1043
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:54,405
This is it.

1044
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:56,908
I'm up! I'm up!
I'm up. I'm up.

1045
01:14:57,075 --> 01:14:59,911
Okay okay, do your breathing.

1046
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:02,038
Okay, how far apart
are the contractions?

1047
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:05,166
Five minutes? Fine.
Plenty of time.

1048
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:08,836
The dream was so bizarre, Les.

1049
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:11,172
As if I was trapped
in the trunk of a car

1050
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,841
and suddenly the trunk
flipped open,

1051
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:17,470
and there you were, rescuing me.

1052
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:20,431
It was so weird.
Sounds crazy.

1053
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:22,725
Oh, I know it sounds
unbelievable,

1054
01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:25,645
but somehow you're always
there to hold me

1055
01:15:25,812 --> 01:15:27,647
like you are right now.

1056
01:15:27,814 --> 01:15:31,776
I felt so safe and so warm.

1057
01:15:33,153 --> 01:15:35,404
I'm sorry I was such
a sleepyhead tonight.

1058
01:15:35,572 --> 01:15:37,198
You must have been so bored.

1059
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:38,533
Oh, no, don't be silly.

1060
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,744
Tonight for me was like
non-stop action.

1061
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:44,497
Oh.
When can we go out again?

1062
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:47,875
Honestly, Mercedes,
tonight might be the last night

1063
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:49,460
anybody ever sees me alive.

1064
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:52,547
Why?
What happened?

1065
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:56,342
It's a long complicated story.
You don't want to hear about it.

1066
01:15:57,469 --> 01:15:59,428
Does it have a happy ending?

1067
01:15:59,596 --> 01:16:02,723
Mm-hmm.
It has so far.

1068
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:05,101
Hopefully one day
I'll get to tell you how it ends.

1069
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:07,228
I'll be here.

1070
01:16:16,029 --> 01:16:17,572
Bye.

1071
01:16:23,161 --> 01:16:24,161
Ow!
The baby?

1072
01:16:24,329 --> 01:16:26,247
No, the laces are too tight.

1073
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,040
Okay, honey.
Robert?

1074
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:30,668
Honey? Whoa.

1075
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:33,421
Okay. Oh, wait,
let me get my jacket.

1076
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:34,909
Where's my jacket?
Okay, okay.

1077
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:36,607
Where's my jacket? Where is it?
Okay.

1078
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:38,676
Oh, I forgot the bag.
I forgot the bag.

1079
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:40,511
Okay, I'm gonna wait here.

1080
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:41,929
Okay.
Okay.

1081
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:43,137
Calm down, honey.
You okay?

1082
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:44,473
You okay?
Good. Yeah, I'm fine.

1083
01:16:44,641 --> 01:16:45,725
I'm fine.
Ow.

1084
01:16:45,892 --> 01:16:47,351
Wait. Oh, no. Okay.
Another one.

1085
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:48,519
Okay.
Uh-oh.

1086
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:50,646
Okay, yeah, put your arm on me.
Put your arm.

1087
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:56,777
Oh, man.

1088
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:58,529
Here we go.

1089
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:12,877
Uh, uh-oh.
What?

1090
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:14,670
What? What?

1091
01:17:14,838 --> 01:17:17,423
Oh, gosh, I'm fine.

1092
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:21,010
I'm sorry. I'm fine now.
What do you mean you're fine?

1093
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:23,596
I think it was air bubbles
from the pickle or something.

1094
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:25,723
Honey, are you sure?
Oh, gosh.

1095
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:27,291
The car's right here.
I'm sorry.

1096
01:17:27,392 --> 01:17:29,685
I'm sorry, I'm fine.

1097
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:31,604
Oh, man.

1098
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:34,649
Why is the garage door open?

1099
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:36,400
Oh, Natalie probably
left it open.

1100
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:39,195
No, honey,
Natalie took the Audi.

1101
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:42,073
- Where the hell is the Audi?
- Ow.

1102
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,828
Oh, Robert!
What in the?

1103
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:50,414
Robert!

1104
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:52,458
Honey, keep breathing.

1105
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:55,419
Whoa! Whoa!

1106
01:17:59,883 --> 01:18:02,259
What?

1107
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:28,953
Something wrong
with your bed, Les?

1108
01:18:30,163 --> 01:18:34,458
Mind explaining to me what size
shark was responsible for this?

1109
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:37,128
Well, it-
Don't!

1110
01:18:37,295 --> 01:18:39,130
I don't want to know.
I don't want to know.

1111
01:18:39,297 --> 01:18:40,464
Save it for the judge.

1112
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:43,426
Do you have any idea
what you've done tonight, Les?

1113
01:18:43,593 --> 01:18:46,721
What this means to your future
in this house

1114
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:49,014
and on this planet?
I have an idea.

1115
01:18:49,182 --> 01:18:52,810
No, you can't possibly!
You can't even begin to imagine.

1116
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:56,772
We had a college fund
set aside for you.

1117
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:58,607
That's gone now.

1118
01:18:58,775 --> 01:19:02,486
You had free room and board,
two trusting parents,

1119
01:19:02,654 --> 01:19:05,489
and a social life.
It's all gone.

1120
01:19:05,657 --> 01:19:09,034
You had a TV, a stereo,
a baseball mitt,

1121
01:19:09,202 --> 01:19:11,203
a tennis racket, a skateboard,

1122
01:19:11,371 --> 01:19:13,831
a bicycle-all gone.

1123
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:17,209
And you even had sunlight
and a window in your room.

1124
01:19:17,377 --> 01:19:18,544
Robert!

1125
01:19:18,712 --> 01:19:20,713
Let me tell you something,
buddy boy,

1126
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:24,425
you are damn lucky your mother
didn't go into labor tonight.

1127
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:26,260
Robert, I am in labor!

1128
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:28,304
Damn lucky!

1129
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:30,222
What?

1130
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:34,018
Honey, you okay? How far apart
are the contractions?

1131
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:35,466
I don't know.
You don't know?

1132
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:37,354
Is it one minute, two minutes?
How close?

1133
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:40,524
Too close.
Too close. No handle!

1134
01:19:40,692 --> 01:19:42,735
No handle!
No handle.

1135
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:45,446
Okay, honey, okay, we'll be
at the hospital in a minute.

1136
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:47,698
Okay, watch your head.

1137
01:19:47,866 --> 01:19:49,825
Oh, Robert, I want you
in the backseat with me.

1138
01:19:49,993 --> 01:19:51,869
No, honey, I can't.
I have to drive.

1139
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:53,287
Les can drive.
What?

1140
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:55,372
Les who? Not that Les.
No no.

1141
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,458
No, he stays here.
Rudy, you drive.

1142
01:19:57,626 --> 01:20:00,211
Rudy, get in the car!
Dad, Dad.

1143
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:03,881
Dad.
Dad, let me drive.

1144
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:08,219
I can do it, Dad.
Oh! Oh, Robert.

1145
01:20:08,386 --> 01:20:10,054
Please stay with me.

1146
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:12,223
I need you. Ah!

1147
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:16,727
Dad?
Okay, you drive.

1148
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:19,396
But try and do it
like you have a license!

1149
01:20:19,564 --> 01:20:21,357
Let me open the door.

1150
01:20:25,278 --> 01:20:27,863
Ew!
It smells like puke in here.

1151
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:31,283
Shut up, Rudy.

1152
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:34,578
What are you doing?

1153
01:20:34,746 --> 01:20:36,872
Robert.
Dad, sorry, it's a red light.

1154
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,416
Are you crazy?
There isn't a car in sight.

1155
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:42,711
We're rushing your mother to
the hospital, not to a bridge game.

1156
01:20:42,879 --> 01:20:44,588
Come on, go through it.
Okay. Okay.

1157
01:20:46,758 --> 01:20:48,717
What are you doing?
Come on.

1158
01:20:48,885 --> 01:20:50,636
Dad, I'm pushing the gas down.
It ain't moving. I don't know-

1159
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:52,930
It sounds like the transmission.
Try another gear.

1160
01:20:53,098 --> 01:20:54,557
Come on.

1161
01:20:54,724 --> 01:20:56,100
Mom?
Try low.

1162
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:58,769
Don't worry,
I'm just having a baby.

1163
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:00,980
What was that?

1164
01:21:01,147 --> 01:21:03,023
Reverse works, Dad.

1165
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:07,111
Honey?

1166
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:09,655
Let him drive backwards.

1167
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:12,032
Let him drive sideways.
I don't care.

1168
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,743
Just get me there!

1169
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:19,206
All right, but be careful.

1170
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:21,041
I will.

1171
01:21:26,631 --> 01:21:28,173
Whoa!

1172
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:32,094
Baby.
Throw the golf clubs.

1173
01:21:32,262 --> 01:21:34,305
Oh, okay.

1174
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:45,524
No, go right!
No, left.

1175
01:21:45,692 --> 01:21:47,818
No, go right. No.

1176
01:21:49,112 --> 01:21:51,488
What are you doing?
Get off the sidewalk.

1177
01:21:51,656 --> 01:21:54,491
Okay, that's it.
I'm driving, pull over.

1178
01:21:56,286 --> 01:21:58,704
Look out!
Hold it!

1179
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:10,674
What are you doing?
Les, you're going the wrong way.

1180
01:22:13,511 --> 01:22:16,722
Look out!
Where'd you people learn to drive?

1181
01:22:17,724 --> 01:22:20,309
Okay, we're good.

1182
01:22:33,531 --> 01:22:35,574
Hmm?

1183
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:38,994
Hmm?

1184
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:46,377
Oh! Ow! God!

1185
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:50,547
Anderson!
Whoa, goddamn car.

1186
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:58,222
Ahh!

1187
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,557
How are you, honey?
I'm wet.

1188
01:23:04,854 --> 01:23:07,189
Hey, slow it down there, buddy.
Hey, stop!

1189
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:11,986
Stop, stop, stop!

1190
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:15,072
This is it. Okay.

1191
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,700
Woman in labor!
What the hell's the matter with you?

1192
01:23:17,867 --> 01:23:21,036
Woman in labor!
Woman in labor!

1193
01:23:21,204 --> 01:23:24,415
Come on, honey.
Okay okay. Keep breathing.

1194
01:23:24,582 --> 01:23:26,500
Keep breathing.
Robert.

1195
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:27,960
Come on!
Mom?

1196
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:31,922
Ow, ow, ow.
Careful, she's in labor.

1197
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:33,330
I'm fine.
Rudy, go with Mom.

1198
01:23:33,425 --> 01:23:35,300
I'll be right there, honey.

1199
01:23:36,469 --> 01:23:39,388
Come here, I want to talk to you.
Come here.

1200
01:23:39,556 --> 01:23:41,265
Come here.

1201
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:43,267
Come here.

1202
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:46,395
Where'd you learn
to drive like that?

1203
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:48,981
I guess last night, Dad.

1204
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:51,692
Yeah? Must have been
one hell of a crash course.

1205
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:58,323
Look, don't worry about Grandpa.
The damage isn't that bad.

1206
01:23:58,491 --> 01:24:01,118
We'll get the car fixed.
Maybe he won't notice.

1207
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:04,872
It's slipping!
Look out, the beam! Stand clear!

1208
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,124
Oh, shit!

1209
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:10,294
I'm losing it!
Look out!

1210
01:24:20,972 --> 01:24:23,724
Hello?

1211
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:26,935
Hello?

1212
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:31,190
Anybody home?

1213
01:24:31,357 --> 01:24:33,400
It's Grandpa.

1214
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:35,444
What are you
gonna tell him, Dad?

1215
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:37,112
Well, the truth could kill him,

1216
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,697
but I guess he's getting
kind of old, huh?

1217
01:24:38,865 --> 01:24:40,324
What's everybody sweating about?

1218
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:43,786
He's been away a long time.
He'll want to come in, relax.

1219
01:24:43,953 --> 01:24:46,955
Come on, damn it, open up.
He hasn't seen the twins yet.

1220
01:24:47,123 --> 01:24:49,374
I know my father.
Last thing in the world

1221
01:24:49,542 --> 01:24:51,543
he's going to be worried about
is his car.

1222
01:24:51,711 --> 01:24:53,629
Hi, Dad.

1223
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:57,132
Where's my Caddy?
Les did it!

1224
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:59,510
It was Les.
I didn't-

1225
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:11,355
What in the hell is that?

1226
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:14,691
Uh...
Son of a bitch.

1227
01:25:14,859 --> 01:25:17,361
What in the hell is that?

1228
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:19,822
It's your car, Grandpa.

1229
01:25:19,989 --> 01:25:21,865
Your car.

1230
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:31,792
Dad?
What is it?

1231
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,503
What?
What's the matter?

1232
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:36,046
Dad, what-what is it?

1233
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:38,590
Why are you laughing?

1234
01:25:38,758 --> 01:25:42,052
Here, I had a little trouble
with your car too.

1235
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:47,683
My BMW?

1236
01:25:47,851 --> 01:25:49,643
Son of a bitch!

1237
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:52,312
Yo.

1238
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,399
Les, you know how you said
when you got your license,

1239
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:58,569
you wanted a BMW?
Well, here you go. It's all yours.

1240
01:25:58,736 --> 01:26:00,654
Take good care of it.

1241
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:02,948
Thanks, Dad,
that's very generous of you.

1242
01:26:03,116 --> 01:26:05,450
But, you know,
I don't need the BMW anymore.

1243
01:26:05,618 --> 01:26:08,954
Les?

1244
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:11,748
I already have a Mercedes.

1245
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:15,419
Don't wait up, guys.
