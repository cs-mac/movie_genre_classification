1
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:58,446
CARL:
You have very beautiful toes.

2
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,950
Did l ever tell you that?
Yes, you have.

3
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:04,190
l'm not even...
l'm not even a foot guy.

4
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,824
They're not even webbed.
Are you concentrating
on the game,

5
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:10,494
or are you just lusting
after the feet of your
soon-to-be wife?

6
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,271
l'm concentrating.

7
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:18,041
NElL: Carl, it's Neil.
Are you there?

8
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:19,668
No, we're not.

9
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:23,045
NElL: Carl. lt's Neil.
There's a problem.

10
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,577
NElL: There's
a wedding-related problem.

11
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,515
All right, go. Get it.

12
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,015
Hey.

13
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:33,217
NElL: l hear you whispering
about not answering me.

14
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:36,521
Just remember,
when this is all over

15
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,464
it's just you and me.

16
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:45,795
NElL: Carl, if you're humping,
stop, 'cause l'm coming in.

17
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,169
Dude, it's Dupree.

18
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:59,174
How the hell
did Dupree end up
on the wrong island?

19
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,413
Dupree was born
on the wrong island.

20
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,650
MAN: Gentlemen,
move this out of the way,
please! We're coming through.

21
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:09,854
Thank you very much.
Right this way, please.

22
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,021
Careful with the boxes.

23
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:12,587
Ten minutes ago
those were supposed to be out.

24
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,564
Where's Mr. Thompson?

25
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,237
MOLLY:
Dad, this is incredible.

26
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,009
We really didn't
need all this.

27
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,141
l know. But l did.

28
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:40,491
NElL: Dupree!

29
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,688
There he is.

30
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,061
Did other people land
on the wrong island?

31
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,760
DUPREE: Guys, l know
l'm in the doghouse,
but come on.

32
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:52,668
These islands,
Maui, Cowee, Lenowi,
very easy to get mixed up.

33
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,104
Don't worry, you're here.
Don't worry.

34
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,971
l got my head
turned around.
l'm sorry.

35
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,070
Come here, you big lug.
All right.

36
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,646
THOMPSON: Thank you.

37
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,582
Folks, this is
a bittersweet time for me.

38
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:09,588
A day that Molly's mother,
rest her soul,
and l used to dream about.

39
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,887
On one hand, l'm inheriting
a new son-in-law,

40
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,384
but on the other,

41
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,797
Daddy's losing
his only little girl.

42
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:23,424
Now, when Molly told me
that she was gonna marry Carl,

43
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,094
l said, ''Who?''

44
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,566
And Molly said,
''Daddy, he works for you.''

45
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:31,735
l said, ''Honey, l've got
1,200 employees nationwide.''

46
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,608
But then l started to worry.

47
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,013
Maybe he was some young buck
trying to push me aside,

48
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,381
grab the reins of my company.

49
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:45,787
And then l met Carl,
sitting in cubicle 26.

50
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:50,725
And l said,
''You know, l like my chances.''

51
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,232
So, ladies and gentlemen,
will you raise your glass

52
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,360
to Molly and Carl,
to health and happiness.
He's funny.

53
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,596
Cheers.

54
00:03:58,671 --> 00:03:59,763
ALL: Hear! Hear!

55
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:11,249
ALL: One! Two! Three! Carl!

56
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,644
Hey, everybody,
listen up.

57
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,623
Now, wait.
Just wait.

58
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:22,484
ln honor of your
impending nuptials,

59
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:27,329
l want to perform a feat
that l've used to mark
every special occasion

60
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,630
in our lives since
at least high school.

61
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:32,296
Ladies and gentlemen,
birds and bees,

62
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,899
l present to you
the Flaming Tornado!

63
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,907
Honey, look who's here!
Hi!

64
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,741
This is just
a safety precaution.

65
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,350
Okay. Little room here.
Need to focus.

66
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,921
Barkeep, your finest
Kentucky bourbon,
low-grade tequila...

67
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,482
l've got a mai tai.

68
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,189
Don't let him start
till l get back.
...lemon slices, a funnel,

69
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,595
and an open flame.

70
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,098
NElL: Yeah!

71
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,300
Okay. Funnel.

72
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,438
ALL: Tornado! Tornado!

73
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,771
Open flames.
Carl will have the honor.

74
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,744
Will the groom
please light the liquid?

75
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:17,044
Carl, grab this.
Carl, you got...
Where...

76
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,214
What are you doing?
Do the Tornado.

77
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,849
Maybe later.
NElL: No!

78
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,552
No.
What are you doing, man?

79
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,254
No, we'll do it later.

80
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,489
Do it now!

81
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,325
MAN: Carl has to be here.
Now!

82
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,662
Let Carl come and do it.
Dude.

83
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:37,534
l'm doing the Tornado, bitch!

84
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,764
Do that Tornado!

85
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,606
CROWD: Neil! Neil! Neil!

86
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,307
GlRL: Oh, my God!

87
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,789
Yo, Tornado Man.

88
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,256
This one is for you,
my brother.

89
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,661
Nice one.

90
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,761
Well, l guess this is where
the road ends for you and me.

91
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,931
We had a good run,
though, didn't we?

92
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:17,498
Hey, Dupree, l'm not dying.
l'm just getting married.

93
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,303
Yeah, l know. Hey, listen.

94
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,909
l feel bad about, you know,
earlier when l was laughing
like a hyena

95
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,146
when Mr. Thompson
was making all those
jokes at your expense.

96
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,519
Well, they weren't
really at my expense.
No, no, no, they were.

97
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,649
lt was a shot
across your bow.
Yeah? You think?

98
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,659
lt wasn't that funny.
l mean, it was,

99
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,491
but l shouldn't
have been laughing,
'cause l'm your best man,

100
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,157
and l don't want this guy
getting in your head, okay?

101
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,666
'Cause he's in my head
a little bit.

102
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,100
lt just...
lt's... l don't know.
l don't want you to forget

103
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,502
that you're bringing something
to the table, too, okay?

104
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,507
You've got that...
That Carlness.

105
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,167
That little
twinkle in your eye.

106
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,472
And you're giving it
to me right now.

107
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,013
That little glint
that says they're
never gonna beat you.

108
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,413
They can't lay
a glove on you.

109
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,412
And don't forget that,
because you can't put
a price tag on it.

110
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,510
End of sermon.

111
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,987
Well, thanks, buddy,
l appreciate it.

112
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,356
But, you know, l really think
he was kidding around.

113
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,328
Yeah.
Guy's got a kind of
a weird sense of humor.

114
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:14,093
Besides, it's not like
l'm gonna be working for him
for the rest of my life.

115
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,600
You know,
l got plans of my own.

116
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,397
There it is.
There's that Carlness.

117
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,899
They can't lay
a glove on you,
can they?

118
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,876
God, l admire you.
l really do.

119
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,841
That's no secret.

120
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,044
Thanks, buddy. Thanks.

121
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,751
Oh, l wanted to give you this.

122
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,552
You know,
for being my best man.

123
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,323
You got to be shitting me.
lt's a flask!

124
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,925
You like it?
l love this.

125
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,630
Good.
Hey, you know, that reminds
me of the groomsmen outfits.

126
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:53,865
l really like them,
but l'm wondering,

127
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,306
should mine
be a little different
since l'm the best man?

128
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,637
What did you have in mind?

129
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,439
Just like a little
insignia or a patch.

130
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,911
l don't want
people to be confused.

131
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,277
l'm talking
something understated,

132
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:03,815
like a lightning bolt.
Nothing big.

133
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,747
Lightning bolt?
Something.

134
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:10,150
Could be cool.
Yeah. l like it.

135
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:15,890
Although, it is going
to be listed in the program
that you're the best man.

136
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:17,990
Really?
Uh-huh.

137
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,723
That's pretty good. Okay.

138
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,325
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That should be enough.

139
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,274
Now, is Neil gonna be
okay over there?

140
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,505
l'm seeing him,
and it looks like
the tide's coming up.

141
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,080
Neil's gonna be fine.

142
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,429
Bingo!

143
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:29,293
MOLLY: Oh, wow!
How many thank-you notes
do you think we have to write?

144
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,632
Well, l counted 1 1 1 .

145
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,234
Honey, l'm gonna do
half of them.

146
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,700
Oh, come on. Really?
No, no, no. Really.

147
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,406
Dear whoever gave us
this platter, l love it!

148
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:45,143
Finally a platter.
Just what l always wanted
ever since l was a little boy.

149
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:48,516
(CHUCKLlNG)
And now you've made
my platter dreams come true.

150
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,524
That's perfect.
And then you write
55 more just like that,

151
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,355
and you're done.
Yeah.

152
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,686
<i>MOLLY: Hi, this is CarI:</i>

153
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,165
And this is Molly.
Molly.

154
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,860
We can't get
to the phone right now.
You've reached the Petersons.

155
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,062
So, if you
leave a message...
Wait for the beep.

156
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,900
...we'll get back to you
as soon as we can.
All right...

157
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,134
Have a beautiful day.

158
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,044
All right, let's do it again.
No. That was really cute.

159
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,603
l called you Carl.
lt was really funny.
Molly, it was cheesy.

160
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,774
(LAUGHlNG)
No, it wasn't cheesy.

161
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,714
Give it to me.
lt's totally cheesy.

162
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,810
Give me the machine.
No! lt's good cheesy!

163
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,650
Give me the machine.
No!

164
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,186
PACO: lD?
Hey, married guy,
how you doing?

165
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:30,387
Good morning, Reese.

166
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,727
lD?
Top of the morning, Paco.

167
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,139
So, we're back
from the honeymoon.

168
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,650
Oh, yeah, we...

169
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,913
We had a great time, sir.
lt was just...

170
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,353
lt was really wonderful.

171
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:00,620
So l took a look
at your proposal
while you were gone.

172
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:04,753
The Oaks at Mesa Vista.
You like it?

173
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,162
Did l like it?
l loved it!

174
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,364
lt's perfect for lot 208.

175
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,601
208? lt's huge.

176
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:18,273
lf l may, Mr. Thompson, it...

177
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:24,813
Mesa Vista is really
more of a smaller,
40-unit eco-community.

178
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:28,012
Not anymore, Carl.
You got to think big,
you got to think bold.

179
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,988
You're a married man now.
You're married
to my little girl.

180
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,787
l'm fast-tracking
this project.
And you, sir,

181
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,690
you're the lead designer
on it.

182
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,626
Excuse me, sir?
That's right.

183
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,824
You are the lead designer.

184
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,868
Wow, that's...
Wow, that's...
That's great.

185
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:47,903
What happened to Harrison?

186
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,634
l had to let him go
while you were gone.

187
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,506
l had a little problem
with Rancho del Mar.

188
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:55,172
But, Carl,
l believe in you.

189
00:11:55,915 --> 00:12:00,579
You've got it.
lt's here and it's here.

190
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:06,047
Release it.
Okay. l'll do that, sir.

191
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,264
Release it.

192
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,898
Wow! l can't believe it.
He made you lead designer.

193
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,671
Yeah. Apparently,
he just loved my proposal.

194
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,647
And it's a little bit bigger
than l initially planned,

195
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:31,410
but you know, hey,
maybe that's a good thing.

196
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,610
So, what does this mean?

197
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,778
Well, it means
l've got my own office.

198
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,355
<i>Which is reaIIy great:
Oh, and it's got a view:</i>

199
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,325
A view of trees and some cars.
lt's just terrific, and...

200
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,486
Living the dream, honey.
Living the dream.

Bullshit.

00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,171

do you get to stay out?
l used to have midnight.

218
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,079
Do you get midnight?
'Cause l was late once, and...

l'm a grown man, Neil.
l don't have a curfew.

Not yet you don't.

221
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,783
But in all seriousness,
you got to tell me something,
okay?

222
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,419
Do l smell like beer?
Yeah.

223
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,123
Good. Because you know what
l don't smell like, then?

224
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,929
Cigarettes and weed.
That one's free.

225
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:57,963
Yeah!

226
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:03,237

Still undefeated!

00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,833
Yes! Nice.

Will you look at this guy?
Look at you.

00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,304
ls this what it looks like
to be married?

230
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,281
Come here, man.
lt's still early on.

231
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,477
To fidelity, commitment,
the whole shebang.

232
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:16,350
Yeah, and l also
got a promotion today.

233
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:21,015
Add it to the list.
Forever blessed
as the dream continues.

234
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,993
How are you doing, buddy?
How am l doing?

235
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,724
Good question.

236
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,494
Turns out l got fired
for taking that week off
to go to the wedding.

237
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,558
Wait a minute.
You got fired?

238
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,330
Apparently,
l never had authorization.

239
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,736
My boss claims
he never received my e-mail.

240
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,831
Then l had a little bit
of a cash flow situation,

241
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,469
so l ended up
losing my apartment.

242
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,042
You're not living
out of your car?

243
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,172
Carl, l'm not an animal.

244
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,680
Plus, it was a company car.
So when l lost the job...

245
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,483
lt's okay.
l picked up a ten-speed.

246
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,649
Dave's letting me crash
at the bar after hours.

247
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,990
Dupree,
you can't sleep in a bar.
We're not in our 20s anymore.

248
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,824
Sure you can. l got
a cot set up in the back.

249
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,091
This is ridiculous.

250
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,359
Look, you're gonna
come home and you're
going to stay with us.

251
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,833
That's sweet of you to say,
but l can't impose,
and l won't.

252
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,201
Dupree will land
on his feet as always.

253
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,706
Can l have a toast, please?
Thank you.

254
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:11,242
Listen, Dupree,
we've got to get
rid of the cot.

255
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:14,210
Some of the regulars
are starting to complain.

256
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,410
They don't think it's fair
that you get to sleep here
and they don't.

257
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,947
Curley said that, didn't he?

258
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,953
Curley? Curley!
What?

259
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,082
What? You got a problem
with me sleeping on the cot?

260
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,853
We all have a problem
with you sleeping on the cot.

261
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,419
We took a vote.
The ayes have it.

262
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,297
Dupree? Live with us?
Not live.

263
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,533
Just stay for a couple of days

264
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,969
until he gets back
on his feet.

265
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,802
Molly, he's been
sleeping in a bar.

266
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,467
How does that happen?
Who knows? lt's Dupree.

267
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:47,376
l mean, l told you.
His mother moved to
Florida with that yoga idiot,

268
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,812
and all of his friends
are married,
including myself.

269
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,975
He's got nowhere to go.
He's like an orphan.

270
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,410
Wait a second.

271
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:58,886
What's all this?

272
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,358
This is that celebration
we were supposed to have

273
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:04,055
about your promotion.
Oh, that's right.

274
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:06,088
l'm sorry, hon.

275
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,995
Look, Molly,
let me go outside

276
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,501
and tell Dupree
to bring his bags in...

277
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,060
What? Dupree's here?

278
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,439
Carl! Carl.

279
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,502
Carl.

280
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,438
Okay, look, you're right.

281
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:25,414
l screwed up. l did this
all wrong, and l'm sorry.

282
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,513
l should have called first.

283
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:33,757
You know what?
Maybe l should just give him
some money for a motel.

284
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,919
Carl. Carl.

285
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:41,294
He's your best friend.
He's here.

286
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,331
He can stay.
That's great, Molly.

287
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,869
Look, it's only gonna
be for a couple days.

288
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,939
Well, a week at the most.
Okay.

289
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,941
After that,
he's out of here.

290
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,604
Keep those candles burning.
l'll be right back.

291
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,839
Okay.

292
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,119
Hey, Molly.

293
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,157
l want you to know l really,
really appreciate this, okay?

294
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,989
Yeah. No. lt's really
no problem, Dupree.
Thanks.

295
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,722
Nice moose.
Oh, yeah.

296

Murphy,
say hello to the missus.

Thank you. And, hey, listen,
just to put your minds
at ease,

304
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,507
this is not a permanent
situation. Okay?

305
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,881
l'm hitting the job trail,
l'm gonna hit it hard
tomorrow.

306
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,386
Wheels of change
are in motion.

307
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,548
Good. Good.
That's a good attitude.

308
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:42,116
Despite what my ex-boss said,
l'm not unhirable.

309
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,526
Those copiers didn't exactly
sell themselves.

310
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,461
And frankly, l think
we had an inferior product,

311
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,590
and l'd tell people that
if they asked.

312
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,032
l wasn't going to lie
for that son of...

313
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,230
l don't want to get
started on him, but...

314
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:56,138
Okay, great.
Well, make yourself at home,

315
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,300
and Molly and l are...

316
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,140
Well,
we're going to go upstairs
and take care of some stuff.

317
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:05,080
Well, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Listen, we're all adults here.

318
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,243
You're newlyweds.
Making love's
a big part of that.

319
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,879
You're supposed to
explore each other.
l get it.

320
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,115
Come on.

321
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,451
lf this situation's
gonna work,

322
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,185
we've got to be honest
with each other.

323
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,558
Now, go on.
Enjoy yourselves.
l'm not gonna listen.

324
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,587
Hump away. Go on,
get out of here.
Good night.

325
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:20,825
Okay.

326
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,968
Good night.

327
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:45,314
MOLLY: l'm kind of dreading
the talk with his parents.

328
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:49,190
He hasn't really been treating
anybody very nicely at...

329
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,796
That's not good.
No. Not for us

330
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,029
or our couch.

331
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,732
Computer skills. Not really.

332
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,161
The Oaks at Mesa Vista.

333
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,196
This is exciting, isn't it?

334
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,533
Stunning. Just stunning.

335
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,342
You know, sir, if we're
not gonna have any trees,

336
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,470
(CELL PHONE RlNGlNG)
maybe we should consider
changing the name.

337
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,344
No. No, no,
l love the name.

338
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,646
Names are important, Carl.

339
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,853
Are you gonna
answer that phone?

340
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,617
Give me a second.

341
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,488
<i>What do you want?
DUPREE: CarI, hey:</i>

342
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,494
Real quick, where
do you keep the plungers?

343
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,393
A plunger? What do you need
a plunger for?

344
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:36,127
No reason. Just want
to stay on top of stuff.

345
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:37,793
What do you mean ''no reason''?
What happened?

346
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,861
No reason. l just want
to know where things are
in case there's an emergency,

347
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:42,201
which there probably
never will be.

348
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,435
l don't have time for this.
l'm...

349
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:47,202
l don't have time for this.
l'm at work. l got to go.

350
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,712
(WATER GURGLlNG)
You better
make some time for it

351
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,077
'cause we got
a little bit of a situation.

352
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:52,514
l didn't want to have to
say anything, but...

353
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:54,579
Carl?

354
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,445
Just stopped.

355
00:20:58,724 --> 00:20:59,884
Where were we?

356
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:03,758
We were talking
about names, Carl.
How important they are.

357
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:08,062
Would you ever
consider letting
Molly keep her last name?

358
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:12,226
l mean, l know
it's a strange request
coming from a father-in-law,

359
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:16,263
but a man's name
is his legacy,

360
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,468
and if Molly takes yours,

361
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,842
then the Thompson name
dies with me.

362
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:25,339
Well, there's lots
of Thompsons around,
aren't there?

363
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,817
Not in a direct line, Carl.
No, no, not in a direct line.

364
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,249
Well, what about our kids?

365
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:38,428
Children should have
the last name of the father,
don't you think?

366
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,624
You're having kids?

367
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:44,191
Well, not right now,
but eventually.

368
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,398
You know, in certain
Asian cultures, Carl,

369
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,705
the husband
takes the wife's name.

370
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,439
Wait a minute. You just said
a man's legacy is his name.

371
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,345
All right.
What about a hyphen?

372
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,444
A hyphen?
Yeah.

373
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,544
l could ask Molly,
but l don't think she...

374
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,188
Wait a minute. You mean me.

375
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,289
You mean
l'm supposed to hyphenate.

376
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,091
Well, then you can still use
your own name, only you'll be
hyphenating it. lt's win-win.

377
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,496
With all due respect,
not for me it isn't, sir.

378
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,501
All right, forget it.
You're obviously upset
about it.

379
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:20,504
You know what,
l'm sorry l even
brought it up.

380
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:26,535
Let's keep focused
on your project.

381
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,016
Come on! Come on! Toshi,
what are you doing?
You gave him a meatball!

382
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,182
BOY: Watch the car!

383
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:42,719
DUPREE: Throw it, throw it.
We got him.

384
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:44,921
(HORN HONKlNG)
Throw it, throw it!

385
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:48,193
Did he touch the plate? He...
Oh, here we go.

386
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:51,030
The game just turned. Yes!

387
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,867
Carl Peterson,
third team honorable mention.

388
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:57,170
All-district, 1984.
We get Carl.

389
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:58,834
BOY: No, we get him.
Hey, what's going on?

390
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,810
There he is.
Hey, sweet heat.

391
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,471
Time to dust off
the old jockstrap.

392
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,175
This kid Dougie's been
killing us all afternoon.

393
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,047
We need your arm out there.
Let's go.

394
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,055
Dupree, l'd love to,
but l can't. l kind of
had a rough day.

395
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,814
And l better go in
and see Molly.

396
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,794
l like it.
Family first. Priorities.

397
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,063
Okay, he can't play.
We're gonna have to
do it ourselves.

398
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:25,365
Now listen, l want you to
brush him back here, okay?
What's a brushback?

399
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,598
lt's where you throw it
really close to him.
Scare him a little bit,

400
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:29,162
but don't hit him
'cause he's bigger
than you.

401
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:31,139
But, Mr. Dupree,
l don't even play baseball.

402
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,233
l'm in the orchestra,
remember?

403
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,403
First of all, call me Dupree
'cause l'm your team-mate.

404
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,640
Second of all, so what
if you're in the orchestra.

405
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,114
So was Catfish Hunter.

406
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:41,084
Let's go. Let's go.
Here we go! Here we go!
Hey, batter, batter...

00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,121
Hi! How was work?

408
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,256
lt was fine.

409
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,415
Good fine? Bad fine?
Fine, fine.

410
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:53,021
You wouldn't believe
the response l'm getting
for my Career Day program.

411
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,430
And l saved a spot
for you on the 15th
if you're interested.

412
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,933
Yeah, of course.

413
00:23:57,002 --> 00:24:00,768
l'll bring in some blueprints
and maybe even some models.

414
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:01,897
lt'll be fun.
TOSHl: No. Get away.

415
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:04,464
DOUGlE: You hit me!
You hit me on purpose!
The kids'll really love it.

416
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:05,805

''Carl and Molly, press two.''
Okay?

Look, l told Dupree
not to change anything
without asking,

450

00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,040
Dupree's gonna
get the hang of this.

452
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:53,278
He's never truly been
domesticated. He's like
the ape-man of Borneo.

453
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,479
Oh, so we're the lucky ones
who get to housebreak him?

454
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,988
No, you know what l mean,
honey.

455
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:00,924
l'm over it.

456
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:04,288
l finished
my thank-you notes today.

457
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:08,164
Do you need help
with your half?
No, no, no, l...

458
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:14,303
Candlesticks, bread maker,
Crock-Pot. l got them covered.

459
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,331
lt's my final offer.

460
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,432
No, l got them covered.

461
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:25,607
(MOLLY EXCLAlMlNG)
Sorry to interrupt. Oh!

462
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:28,016
Damn it, Dupree!
What is this?
This is an emergency.

463
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,554
l'm sorry.
The downstairs crapper,
it's on the fritz again.

464
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:31,816
What do you mean,
''lt's on the fritz''?

465
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,324
l don't know.
lt's on the fritz.

466
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,722
Please tell me he's joking.

467
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,257
We might need some matches.

468
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,461
Does that
answer your question?

469
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,739
MOLLY: Oh, God!

470
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:52,666
Dupree! Oh, my God. l don't...

471
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:56,938
Carl! Carl!

472
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,477
Dupree! Dupree?

473
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,111
Yo!

474
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:05,645
Dupree, what you did
in our bathroom last night
was disgusting.

475
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,351
Molly nearly passed out.

476
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,653
l know, l know.

477
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:11,195
Believe me.
l'm never eating
Buffalo wings again.

478
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,730
l don't care how much
l love them. l'm off them.

479
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:17,393
lt's weird. l used to have
a stomach like a billy goat,
but not anymore.

480
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:20,130
Now, l made a little breakfast
for... Molly, great.

481
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,467
Come here.
Morning.

482
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:22,904
DUPREE: Good morning.

483
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,636
Right here. Let me get
this chair for you here.

484
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,168
Have a seat.
Breakfast is served.
Yes.

485
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,841
l believe Carl told me
you're a fan of

486
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:35,010
the banana pancake
and the soy macchiato.

487
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:36,678
One second.

488
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,553
DUPREE: l want
this to be perfect.

489
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,750
Did you tell him all this?

490
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:42,716
Here you go.

491
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:44,554
Soy macchiato.

492
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,826
Dupree, you really
didn't have to do all this.
Yes, l did have to do this.

493
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,992
Look, l know l got off
on the wrong foot,

494
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:54,004
and l just want you both
to know that l really
appreciate this.

495
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,199
And l'm grateful.

496
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,600
l don't know
what to say, but...
Don't say anything.

497
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,475
Just accept my apology
and enjoy this feast.

498
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:03,980
l'm off to a very promising
job interview

499
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:07,177
which explains
my natty attire.
Wish me luck. Goodbye.

500
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,982
Carl: Good luck.
Go get them, tiger!
l will. Thank you.

501
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,780
Off like a prom dress.

502
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,628
MANAGER: So, why don't you
describe yourself, Mr. Dupree.

503
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,722
l'm a people person.
Very personable.

504
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,529
l absolutely insist
on enjoying life.

505
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:28,628
Not so task-oriented.
l'm not a workhorse.

506
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,540
lf you're looking
for a Clydesdale,
l'm probably not your man.

507
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,544
Like, l don't live to work.

508
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:36,409
lt's more the other way
around. l work to live.

509
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:40,042
lncidentally, what's
your policy on Columbus Day?

510
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:43,053
Yeah, we work.
Really?

511
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,282
The guy discovered
the New World.

512
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,917
l'm afraid to even ask
about Victory over Japan Day.

513
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,335
Hey, we tried. Right?

514
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,432
Thanks a lot. Yeah.

515
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:06,806
l'm gonna keep my r¨¦sum¨¦.
Excuse me.

516
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,241
You've got to lean into it
and commit to it.

517
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,615
That's the way.
You get hurt if you're afraid.

518
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:17,177
And if you time it
just right, then you both...

519
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:20,314
There he goes. Come down.
You guys got to
get a rhythm going.

520
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:21,688
Come on.

521
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,128
Here, watch me. See, l'm just
running down the ramp.

522
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:26,891
lt's actually harder
than on a skateboard.

523
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,865
There we go.
Speed's your friend. Hold on.

524
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,833
Yeah, come down. Go.

525
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:34,235
You see how he's timing it?
And then he pops it up? Go!

526
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,569
Yes! Go! One more time.

527
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:38,039
So,
what's going on over here?

528
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:41,544
Carl, check out this badass
skate ramp l had Aaron's dad
build for us.

529
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:45,047
Hey, man, l was just
telling these guys how we used
to tear it up back in the day.

530
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,243
Yep! Pretty good.

531
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:48,444
Hey, l got an idea.

532
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,488
What do you say we put on
a little show for these guys?

533
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:53,888
Throw down some one-wheelers.
Make it rain out here.

534
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:55,220
Come on. For a second.

535
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:56,452
BOY 1 : Yeah,
let's see what you got.

536
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:57,995
BOY 2: Yeah,
show us something.

537
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:00,360
Okay, give me a board.
Yes! Carl!

538
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:02,023
Step aside, guys.

539
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,727
Honey, l need some help.

540
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:06,599
Carl: Yep,
just like back in the day.

541
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:08,534
DUPREE: Nice!

542
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,039
Carl: Let's show them
how we used to do it.

543
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,099
DUPREE: Step aside.
Step aside.

544
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:18,938
Well, no one ever said
we were gonna live forever.

545
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:20,845
Let's go.

546
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,251
Carl! Carl,
what are you doing?

547
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:26,152
What's it look like
he's doing? He's getting
ready to rip it up.

548
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:29,557
Relax, Molly.
This is only gonna
take a second.

549
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:32,094
BOY: Come on, Dupree!
Say when.

550
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,926
When!
Yeah!

551
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,201
DUPREE: Oh, l'm racked!

552
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,469
Carl!

553
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,476
Oh, l racked
my little Duprees.

554
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,412
When was the last time
you were even on a skateboard?

555
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:54,542
1987.
Oh.

556
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,488
For a second there
we almost had it back.

557
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,083
Carl: Yeah.

558
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:07,087
Carl: What is this?

559
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,596
Are you kidding me?

560
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:12,132
Are you kidding me?

561
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,835
ls this some kind of a joke?

562
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:17,669
Carl,
Thompson wanted more units.

563
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:20,805
Thought it would work better
as a wraparound.

564
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:22,311
Wraparound.

565
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:25,346
Mesa Vista
is not a wraparound.

566
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:29,416
<i>Hasta ma¨¾ana> Paco.
Good night, boss></i>

567
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:34,420
Look, Mr. Thompson.
Hey. You see
the preliminaries?

568
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:38,326
Yeah, l did, and
it's completely different
than my original proposal.

569
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:41,455
God damn it, Carl.
Will you stop fighting this?

570
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:44,695
People buy homes.
Let the government
pay for the parks.

571
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,929
That's why we have taxes.

572
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:56,837
The Oaks at Mesa Vista
is a money train.

573
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,481
You wanna be on it?

574
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,983
Yeah, l'm on it.

575
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:22,339
Money train.
l'll give you a money train.

576
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,176
DUPREE:
Right there! Right there!
You gotta throw it now!

577
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,343
NElL: Please, please, please!

578
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,011
No, he didn't go over!
No! No! Why?

579
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:39,545
He didn't make it, man.
Carl! Welcome home!

580
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:41,682
Come here, buddy!
We got one for you.

581
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,488
DUPREE: Get a beer for him.
What are you guys doing?

582
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,688
We're watching the game.
Yeah, l can see that.

583
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:48,391
Hey, guys!
Please, shut the hell up
for two seconds

584
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,364
'cause it's
fourth and inches.
Please, just shut up.

585
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:51,800
You shut up!
NElL: lt's fourth and inches!

586
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:53,029
Why don't you watch it
in your house?

587
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,299
l can't have friends
over on weeknights
and you know that.

588
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:56,965
Grow a sac.
lt's not my problem, Neil.

589
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,941
Take it up with Annie.

590
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:03,541
Time for the lion tamer.
Yeah, well, l can't
talk to him like this.

591
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,517
What's going on?
You all right?

592
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,814
Yeah. l'm fine.

593
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,679
God, l've been
watching you lately, man,

594
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:15,590
and you're really putting in
the hours, but you got
to find some balance.

595
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:18,958
Find a little Carl time.
You know what l'm saying?
Carl time.

596
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:21,691
<i>MAN ON TV:

00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:25,268

thing tonight.

l mean...

602
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:34,869
You think l've been
overdoing it
with the work thing?

603
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:37,141
l know you've been
overdoing it.

604
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:41,446
Yeah. Shake it loose, huh?
Just live a little, man.
Just live a little.

605
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:45,579
Yeah. You know,
maybe l ought to
make my nachos.

606
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:47,556
Nice!
Yes!

607
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:50,560
Carl time!
NElL: Nachos, Carl nachos
are in my belly.

608
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:53,096
Carl: Hey, Neil,
turn up the volume.
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

609
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,155
You know who else loves
Carl's nachos is Eddie.

610
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:56,927
Give him a call.
l already did.

611
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:59,561
Carl, soup them up, man!
Make them spicy!

612
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,074
Okay, guys.
This is it. This is it.

613
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,770
Come on. Just come on.
Please. Please, God!

614
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:08,675
Send everybody!
Send everybody!

615
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,180
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Damn!

616
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:13,580
DUPREE: No, no.
NElL: No, no.

617
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:14,675
No!

618
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:18,085
No, no!
No! No!

619
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,514
No!
Yes!

620
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:23,492
What did l tell you?
That's what l'm saying!

621
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:27,622
Congratulations, idiots.
Congratulations, guys.
Very good.

622
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:29,131
Fifty pushups, faggot.
Fifty pushups.

623
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,633
l'm not giving you
any pushups.

624
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:33,135
That was the deal.
Fine. Okay? Enjoy it.

625
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:35,536
ALL: One, two...
He has a condition.

626
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,609
ALL: ...three, four.
That's right!
l have a condition.

627
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:39,870
l should not keep doing this.
Come on!

628
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:41,638
NElL: l have a gamey colon,
and it gets spastic
and spasms.

629
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:43,009
Carl:
You don't have a condition.

630
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:45,514
Carl. Carl! Neil,
shut up! Carl.
l didn't read that.

631
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:47,880
Mark, what? What is it, Mark?

632
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:49,647
Molly.

633
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:54,650
Hi.

634
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,857
Oh, hey, Molly.

635
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,829
Carl: You're home early.
Really?

636
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,730
l just invited
some of the guys over

637
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:05,365
to watch a little football.

638
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:09,839
Figured it was just a
little time to loosen up.
A little Carl time.

639
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,806
<i>Me gusta margarita!</i>

640
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:18,671
<i>HoIa, Dupree.</i>

641
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:20,616
<i>HoIa, Molly.</i>

642
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,347
ALL: Charlie.
Brilliant.

643
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,717
CHARLlE: Sorry.
We should go.

644
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,520
You guys want to go?
Yeah, let's get out of here.

645
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,117
That's a good idea.
Let's go to Larry's.

646
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:31,786
Let's get out of here.
Let it go. Let it go.

647
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,420
CHARLlE: What'd l do
with my tie?
Let's go.

648
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:36,125
Bye.
Sorry, l ashed on your floor.

649
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,259
Great.
Take that tie off your head.

650
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:41,361
l'll bring this back tomorrow.
l'll give it to Carl
at the office.

651
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,430
So, don't tell Annie
l was here. And if you do,
don't...

652
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,475
Just don't tell her that
l asked you not to...
Get out, Neil.

653
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,511
Out!
Okay. l'll just go.

654
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:52,644
l know what you're thinking,
Molly.

655
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,947
But we were gonna have
this rug shampooed.
l promise you.

656
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:58,544
Oh, and look. Look at that.

657
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,919
lt's my grandmother's
silver cheese platter.

658
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:04,390
You used it to serve nachos.

659
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:07,286
Well,
nachos have cheese in them.

660
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,836
Let me just start
cleaning up some of...
Dupree, please stop.

661
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,342
Somebody arriving
late for the party.
Don't worry about it.

662
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:25,438
The party... Game's over!

663
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,609
Go away! The party's over!

664
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:31,846
Party... Molly,
for the love of God! Please!

665
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:37,026
We heard there were
some bad boys in here.

666
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,658
There were, but they left.

667
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,564
You know, Carl, l...

668
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:20,460
l really think l've been
pretty cool about this
whole situation,

669
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:23,029
and l hate having
this conversation with you.

670
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,973
But this is not exactly
how l pictured us
getting started.

671
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:27,340
l know.

672
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,637
Look, Dupree's got to go.

673
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,512
No. lt's not about
kicking Dupree out.

674
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:36,349
lt's just that you said
it was gonna be
a couple of days.

675
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,911
Look, Molly.
He's my best friend.

676
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,984
Somehow l feel
responsible for him.

677
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:47,224
Then maybe it's time
to start prioritizing
your responsibilities.

678
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,523
You're right.

679
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:55,372
What if he had
a girlfriend?
Good idea.

680
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:59,500
But how is a guy
with no job, no car,
living on somebody's couch

681
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:03,240
gonna find
any kind of girlfriend?
Our new librarian.

682
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,939
She seems really nice.

683
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:08,576
You want to fix Dupree up
with a really nice librarian?

684
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:11,519
Listen, l know the guy
for 25 years.

685
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:16,390
l think he's more into
the young, foreign,
non-librarian type.

686
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,896
Well, it wouldn't hurt to ask.
l wouldn't get my hopes up.

687
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:21,558
l'll do it.

688
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,797
Oh, that's great.
Do you want to know
anything about her?

689
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:29,066
No. Well, does she have a car?

690
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,732
Yeah. She does.

691
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:35,036
Good. See if she can swing by
and get me around 8:00.
Or quarter to.

692
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:36,545
Tonight?
Please.

693
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,206
Okay.
Candy?

694
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:41,577
Mandy.
Mandy. That's even better.

695
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,454
Librarian.

696
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,054
No. No.

697
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,695
l thought you were
really brave.

698
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:55,755
l mean, l have a whole new
respect for you, Carl.

699
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,563
Well, the rice was okay,
but just for the record,

700
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:00,934
octopus does not
taste like chicken.

701
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,264
But you ate it.

702
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,532
What is that?

703
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,944
<i>Funky CoId Medina?</i>

704
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,004
lt looks like Dupree
brought his date home.

705
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,913
Honey, what is a tie
doing on our door?

706
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:18,579
Molly, l think we ought to
drive around the block
a couple times.

707
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:21,090
Wait a minute. No way.
Mandy's a Mormon.

708
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:22,523
She's not the kind of girl...
A Mormon?

709
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:24,025
...who would get busy
on the first date.

710
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,596
You fixed Dupree up
with a Mormon librarian.

711
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:29,763
Molly, wait!

712
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,169
Oh, my God.
What?

713
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:40,972
Let's drive
around the block.

714
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,509
Carl!

715
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:45,145
That butter dish
was our wedding gift.

716
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,844
Guys, guys! Hold it!
Let me explain.
What was he doing with butter?

717
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,853
Dupree, no need to explain.
lt's not what it looks like.

718
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,684
Dupree,
no explanation necessary.
l know.

719
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,882
Go back in the house!

720
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,982
Not before l thank Molly
for the best night of my life.

721
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,857
Mol, Mol. Thank you.

722
00:39:57,928 --> 00:40:00,419
What happened in there,
it was so natural.
So beautiful.

723
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:02,898
Go back inside.
Listen, l've got neighbors.
l know you do.

724
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:04,161
But listen to me.
l'm in love.

725
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,897
Dupree. Dupree,
l'm not going to do this
with you tonight!

726
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,802
Jesus! Molly,
call the fire department!
Oh, my...

727
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:12,468
Carl!
Mandy!

728
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,238
(MANDY SCREAMlNG)
Mandy! Mandy!

729
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:17,178
Molly: Fire in our house!
lt's fire!

730
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,148
Carl: My couch!
DUPREE: Roll!

731
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:36,423
God, l loved this couch.

732
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:45,675
You know,
when l saw you on fire,
my heart stopped.

733
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:49,201
l had so much adrenaline
pumping through me,
l probably could have...

734
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,182
Could have picked up this car
and just hurled it 10 blocks.

735
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,212
Are you gonna do this,
or am l gonna have to?

736
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:01,118
l'll take care of it.
Tonight, Carl.

737
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,251
Go on, get out of here.

738
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:07,262
Or l'm not responsible
for what these hands
are gonna do. Go!

739
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,064
Bye.

740
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,602
You okay?
Yeah.

741
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:24,175
Yeah, just a little
smoke inhalation.

742
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:32,823
Wow. Unbelievable.

743
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,422
Mandy was
completely unharmed.

744
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:39,293
Fire chief said that
the butter probably
saved her life.

745
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:42,958
You talk about a miracle.
You just got to thank
the big man.

746
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,864
lt's all you can...

747
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:50,439
What is wrong with you?
Why did you have to use
so many candles?

748
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,942
l was just trying
to set a mood.

749
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,007
You know how l am, Carl.

750
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:56,943
Yeah. l do.

751
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:01,679
Look...

752
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,482
lt's about time
you got on the road.

753
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:25,399
You guys need any help?
No, we're good. Relax.

754
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:33,210
DUPREE: Well,
l had a lovely stay.

755
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:36,377
Thank you both
for your generosity.

756
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:41,182
Sorry about last night,
and no hard feelings.

757
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:43,920
l hope. At least,
there are none on my part.

758
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:49,056
Okay. Are you sure
you got a place to go?
Yeah. l got a place to go.

759
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,861
Going to Mandy's.

760
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,702
The librarian?

761
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,204
Don't you think
that's kind of moving
a little quickly, Dupree?

762
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:56,830
Maybe it is, but so what?

763
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:01,071
Something special
is happening there.
l'm not gonna fight it.

764
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:03,942
Hey, take care of this
big mook for me.

765
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,012
Bye. See you guys.

766
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:09,180
Tosh, listen.

767
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,847
You got the heart
of a damn lion.

768
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:16,583
l respect you.
You took a beating,
but you took it like a man.

769
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:19,226
God bless all of you.

770
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,768
DUPREE: Goodbye!

771
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:30,631
Off to Mandy's!

772
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,244
Oh, my God! Carl.

773
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:43,383
Okay!
Sir, are you sure
you're okay?

774
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,285
DUPREE: My helmet saved me.

775
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:52,426
You see that?
He's gonna be fine.

776
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,930
Here's your bag.
Thank you.

777
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,799
Bye!

778
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:05,668
Bye.

779
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,506
Carl.

780
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:12,309
Carl?

781
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:16,681
We've been staring at this
for over two hours.
Let's go get some dinner.

782
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:20,814
Or margaritas.
Celebrate our emancipation.

783
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:25,789
The insurance adjuster
recommended that we
sue Dupree.

784
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:29,866
For a moose head?

785
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,359
(LAUGHlNG) Just curious.

786
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:43,172
lt was the margarita
that did it, wasn't it?

787
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,976
lt was the emancipation
that did it.

788

789
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,983

790
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,800
Oh, my God.
What?

791
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:18,373
Are you kidding me?
What the hell is he doing?

792
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:20,814
Molly: l thought
he was going to Mandy's.

793
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,478
Honey, l don't think
he can see us.

794
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:26,312
Maybe we should
just keep going.

795
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,381
lt's pouring rain outside.

796
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:31,586
Not that bad.
Honey, look at him.

797
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,230
What?

798
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:43,705
Damn it.

799
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:45,674
Molly. Molly!

Dupree.

802
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:58,113
Dupree, what are you doing?
lt's pouring rain outside.

803
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:00,846
l don't know
what l'm doing anymore.

804
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:04,451
Yeah, well,
what about Mandy?
Don't ask.

805
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:16,770
Carl, can you get his bike?

806
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,309
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go home.

807
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,609
Molly: Carl, honey, bike.

808
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:35,481
Molly: Carl!
l'm coming!

809
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:43,097
l really appreciate this,
guys.

810
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,969
Trust me, no more open flames.
l've learned my lesson.

811
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:51,768
All right, well,
it's been a long night.

812
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,003
So, l'm gonna go to bed.

813
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:57,939
Dupree, try not to go to sleep
with that head wet. Okay?

814
00:46:58,015 --> 00:46:59,812
Good night, Molly.

815
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:05,851
Dupree. l don't mean
to come down on you,

816
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:08,686
but you need to start
getting your life together.

817
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:10,282
We're grown-ups now.
Yeah.

818
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,295
You know what l mean?
l know. l know.
You're right.

819
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:16,992
And if you're going to
stay here, things are gonna
be different from now on.

820
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:18,227
No more naked stuff.

821
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,895
Well, it felt natural
to be naked. l...
l don't care!

822
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,904
Okay.
l do not care.

823
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:25,837
Clean up after yourself,
watch the noise,

824
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:28,571
try to help out
around the house, please?

825
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,738
lt's not too much to ask.

826
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:32,538
You're right.

827
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:39,751
Carl? l can be really helpful
when l set my mind to it.

828
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:42,422
And that's what l'm gonna do.

829
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:44,592
Oh, and...

830
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,694
Another thing.

831
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:55,204
Would you mind writing
some thank-you notes for me?

832
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:57,935
Okay.

833
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,202
Yeah. That'd be great.

834
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:03,580
Try to get some sleep.

835
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:10,185
Gut-check time, Dupree.

836

Yeah, Dupree.
l'm gonna need you

00:49:58,528 --> 00:49:59,688
Yeah, no problem.

l would give this Career Day
presentation today at 1 :00.

845
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:06,527
But her father just dropped
a big one on me,

846
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:09,901
so l'm gonna need you
to step in and fill in for me.

847
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,167
Can you do that?

848
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:12,401
l don't know, Carl.

849
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:15,034
l don't know

might find me in over my head.

00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,715
No, not the development
business. School, Dupree.

No, no, l'm talking

Will you quit dicking around
with your little Huffy bike
and listen to me?

857
00:50:49,118 --> 00:50:50,209
Hey, Molly.

858
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:53,981
Dupree, what are you doing?
Carl asked me to fill in.

859
00:50:54,055 --> 00:50:56,489
l guess there was
some sort of work conflict.

860
00:50:56,557 --> 00:50:59,219
What? Conflict?
What kind of conflict?

861
00:50:59,327 --> 00:51:01,021
l don't know.
l don't ask questions.

862
00:51:01,094 --> 00:51:03,187
l just ride
to where l'm needed.

863
00:51:03,296 --> 00:51:06,891
But don't worry.
l'm sort of a
good public speaker.

864
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,298
Oh, no, no. lt's a Career Day
presentation, Dupree.
You don't even have a job.

865
00:51:10,369 --> 00:51:13,167
l understand that.
But here's what
l'd love you to do.

866
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:16,333
Please get Mandy here.
l want her to see this.

867
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:18,309
l think this will
win her back.

868
00:51:18,377 --> 00:51:20,367
Now where are these
little rug rats?

869
00:51:20,478 --> 00:51:22,571
They're in the third door.

870
00:51:24,382 --> 00:51:26,179
Hey, how are you?

871
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:29,516
First of all,
thank you for giving me
the opportunity

872
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:31,520
to come talk to you
on Career Day.

873
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:34,682
Now, l am not
Mr. Carl Peterson

874
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:37,360
and l don't have
a career per se.

875
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:41,193
l guess you could say
my career is living
and loving.

876
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,562
And l do that to the utmost.

877
00:51:47,236 --> 00:51:48,703
DUPREE: She coming?

878
00:51:49,572 --> 00:51:51,334
Keep going? Okay.

879
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:54,431
l see all you
fresh-faced kidlets,

880
00:51:54,543 --> 00:51:58,775
sitting there
in your neat little rows,
and you're all just pods.

881
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,279
Pods, waiting
for your instructions.

882
00:52:01,382 --> 00:52:04,044
Now some of you are
gonna get zapped right away

883
00:52:04,118 --> 00:52:06,382
and be 15-year-old prodigies,

884
00:52:06,454 --> 00:52:10,856
little midget Olympic gymnasts
with their pictures
on cereal boxes.

885
00:52:11,257 --> 00:52:13,919
Some of you will go on to
college, and you'll find
your rhythm there,

886
00:52:14,027 --> 00:52:16,291
and then go chase down
the titans of industry,

887
00:52:16,396 --> 00:52:18,887
or maybe straighten out
our problems at the UN.

888
00:52:18,965 --> 00:52:20,227
But some of you,

889
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:24,395
and this is the group that
no one ever comes into
Career Day and addresses,

890
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:25,869
and it's criminal,

891
00:52:25,938 --> 00:52:28,964
some of you are
just gonna float along,

892
00:52:30,242 --> 00:52:31,936
eating spicy foods,

893
00:52:32,043 --> 00:52:35,240
humming black people's music
into your 30s.

894
00:52:35,313 --> 00:52:37,907
Well into your 30s,
languishing.

895
00:52:37,982 --> 00:52:41,610
This group of pods is gonna
do a lot of languishing.

896
00:52:41,718 --> 00:52:44,653
And you're gonna
take some heat for it.

897
00:52:45,122 --> 00:52:46,783
Sadly, you will.

898
00:52:47,891 --> 00:52:51,826
Europe's a little easier.
They seem to understand
a little better.

899
00:52:51,927 --> 00:52:54,157
So does South America.

900
00:52:54,263 --> 00:52:55,924
l went to Argentina one time,

901
00:52:55,998 --> 00:52:59,764
and everyone just
seemed to be sitting around.
lt was beautiful.

902
00:52:59,835 --> 00:53:02,928
But that's okay.
You stay loose. Stay liquid.

903
00:53:03,071 --> 00:53:05,665
Laugh a lot. But be ready.

904
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,400
That's what Dupree's doing
with his life's little pod.

905
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:12,241

Then l'd fight.

00:53:16,183 --> 00:53:21,143
Then you'll see Dupree
coming in here throwing seven
different kinds of smoke.

909
00:53:32,531 --> 00:53:35,625
That's fine. The pods

l'm done here.

911
00:53:41,906 --> 00:53:44,204

Now, do you think
it went over their head?

912
00:53:44,308 --> 00:53:47,072
No. lt was really good.
They got it. They got it.

913
00:53:47,178 --> 00:53:49,646
Now, where's Mandy?
l'm only gonna do this
one more time,

Dupree, Mandy has to...
She had a...

916
00:53:54,317 --> 00:53:57,252
She had a book
that was lost.

917
00:54:04,393 --> 00:54:06,327
l'm sorry, Dupree.

918
00:54:14,769 --> 00:54:17,260
Dupree, wait, wait, wait.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

919
00:54:17,371 --> 00:54:21,000
Dupree, there's something
you need to know about Mandy.

920
00:54:22,609 --> 00:54:27,205
Well, it turns out that she's
a total slut and is sleeping
with half the male faculty.

921
00:54:28,281 --> 00:54:30,909
What? No.
l'm sorry.

922

Yeah.

923
00:54:33,252 --> 00:54:35,413

Yeah. And to be honest
with you, sir,
they're still in flux.

Carl, l'm going to the bank

l cannot have things in flux.

941
00:55:49,688 --> 00:55:52,122

l'll get on it right away.

Please just sit down.

a few days ago
that l just cannot
get out of my mind.

945
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:06,797
Something about
you and Molly
having children.

946
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:10,837
Oh, right. Yeah, no.
That was...
That was hypothetical.

947

That's not something that
we're talking about doing
any time soon.

when l started dating again?

949
00:56:19,114 --> 00:56:21,139
No idea.
l got a vasectomy.

950

A vasectomy?
Yeah.

951
00:56:24,218 --> 00:56:26,482
Okay.
That's a little extreme,
don't you think?

952
00:56:26,554 --> 00:56:29,546
Not really. lt's a mild

l know he's under
a lot of pressure
right now,

but just lately he seems
like a different person.

No, he's just working
really hard. He gets
like that sometimes.

00:58:23,493 --> 00:58:26,290
Maybe if he opened up
a little bit more.

Look, Carl's
never gonna be mistaken
for the great communicator.

982

l mean, just mention the word
''feelings'' or ''emotion,''

983
00:58:33,569 --> 00:58:35,832
and you watch his eyes
glaze over. But...

through it. Patience.

That's what l did.
l ask a lot of questions.

988

l let him know that l care.

00:59:21,579 --> 00:59:23,069
Did he mention
the mother ship?

997
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:26,671

he was really inspiring.

which you said
was a dream come true.

1012

Why would he do that?
Because he hates you?

That's exactly
what l'm beginning to think.

1014
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:11,016
For the same reason
he's been systematically

01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:13,354
trying to emasculate me
and sterilize me.

that your father,

he invites them out
on a little fishing trip.

invited fishing. Not once.

he hates me.

gets sometimes. l do.

Just what do you think
of vasectomies?

1053
01:02:05,692 --> 01:02:08,456
Cutting off my manhood?
l think it's barbaric.

1054
01:02:08,528 --> 01:02:12,328
No one's getting near
that part of my body.
No one, Carl.

1055
01:02:12,432 --> 01:02:14,627
Unless, of course,
it's a woman.

He doesn't want you
to get a vasectomy.

No, you are.

And you have to stop
doing that now because
your buddy is wrong. Okay?

got a brand-new name.
