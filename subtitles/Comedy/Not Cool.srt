00:07:58,683 --> 00:08:00,816
Sit down;
Let's talk about this.

168
00:08:03,655 --> 00:08:05,621
Yes, I'm selling the shop.

169
00:08:05,623 --> 00:08:07,089
No, we're not broke.

170
00:08:07,091 --> 00:08:09,825
Truth is, the store is doing
pretty well financially.

171
00:08:09,827 --> 00:08:12,028
But most of the business
is from collectors online,

172
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:16,332
so keeping the store open
doesn't make sense anymore.

173
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:19,202
Also, I met someone.

174
00:08:19,204 --> 00:08:20,303
- You did?

175
00:08:20,305 --> 00:08:21,971
- anastasia.

176
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:24,440
- A stripper?

177
00:08:24,442 --> 00:08:25,474
What?

178
00:08:25,476 --> 00:08:26,909
I mean, with a name like that,

179
00:08:26,911 --> 00:08:28,811
she's either a disney princess
or a total slut.

180
00:08:28,813 --> 00:08:31,047
- Come on, she's a vinyl
collector down in florida.

181
00:08:31,049 --> 00:08:32,081
- Boo.

182
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,115
- And I was thinking

183
00:08:33,117 --> 00:08:34,417
after janie graduated
this spring,

184
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,685
I'd move down there with her.

185
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:36,752
This is place is gonna be

186
00:08:36,754 --> 00:08:38,921
way too big for just me, anyhow.

187
00:08:38,923 --> 00:08:40,223
But, hey,

188
00:08:40,225 --> 00:08:42,892
we have one last thanksgiving
at home before we move.

189
00:08:42,894 --> 00:08:44,927
That'll be fun, right?

190
00:08:53,238 --> 00:08:54,971
Okay.

191
00:08:54,973 --> 00:08:57,206
Good talk.

192
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,575
- Am I doing it right?

193
00:08:59,577 --> 00:09:00,710
- No!

194
00:09:00,712 --> 00:09:02,278
Lou, pop your ass!

195
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,481
- I can't believe my parents
turned my room into a gym.

196
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:07,083
- lou, pop that ass!

197
00:09:07,085 --> 00:09:08,484
Watch my ass pop.

198
00:09:08,486 --> 00:09:09,552
- Your ass is poppin'.

199
00:09:09,554 --> 00:09:10,554
- Yeah.

200
00:09:10,555 --> 00:09:11,654
- Girl, it could be worse.

201
00:09:11,656 --> 00:09:12,855
I know a chick whose parents

202
00:09:12,857 --> 00:09:14,924
turned her room
into a sex dungeon.

203
00:09:14,926 --> 00:09:16,492
- Not sure that's worse.

204
00:09:16,494 --> 00:09:19,562
Pop that ass,
pop that ass, pop that ass.

205
00:09:19,564 --> 00:09:20,896
- Girl, why don't you
go out tonight,

206
00:09:20,898 --> 00:09:22,431
get your mind off things?

207
00:09:22,433 --> 00:09:24,867
- The only way that
I could get my mind off things

208
00:09:24,869 --> 00:09:28,237
would be to join a cult and
get myself fucking brainwashed.

209
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:30,206
- Girl, don't even play
about that shit.

210
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,642
I joined a cult once
because they had red track suits

211
00:09:32,644 --> 00:09:34,844
and I wanted a red track suit.

212
00:09:34,846 --> 00:09:37,847
The amount of innocent
I saw slain...

213
00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:40,383
Was not worth
that red track suit.

214
00:09:43,388 --> 00:09:44,787
- God.

215
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:48,224
Apparently, there is
a kegger on plum street

216
00:09:48,226 --> 00:09:49,458
by the creek.

217
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,093
- A kegger by the creek?

218
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:52,495
Tell me you made that shit up.

219
00:09:52,497 --> 00:09:53,963
It sounds like a horror movie.

220
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:56,332
- Believe me,
it is all too real.

221
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:58,200
- Well, then go, and take video.

222
00:09:58,202 --> 00:10:01,237
I want to see where
tori the whorie comes from.

223
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:03,873
- No, look, the whole point
of going to college

224
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,808
is to get away
from all of the people

225
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,144
that you hated in high school.

226
00:10:08,146 --> 00:10:09,779
Why would I want
to go back to that?

227
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:11,213
I mean, it would be
like taking a massive shit

228
00:10:11,215 --> 00:10:14,617
and then shoving it
right back up my butt.

229
00:10:14,619 --> 00:10:16,152
- Really, girl?

230
00:10:16,154 --> 00:10:18,788
- Plus, I'm totally fine
spending the night in.

231
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,589
- I'm gonna fart.

232
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:21,924
- Go ahead, honey.

233
00:10:21,926 --> 00:10:23,459
- No, it's gonna be so loud.

234
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:26,562
- Come on, we've been
married for 25 years.

235
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,335
- My god;
My god.

236
00:10:32,337 --> 00:10:33,469
I...

237
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:37,707
I have messed myself.

238
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:39,675
Ooh.

239
00:10:39,677 --> 00:10:41,911
Ooh, yeah.

240
00:10:45,817 --> 00:10:48,250
Okay, okay.

241
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:50,386
- Girl, you need
to get out that house.

242
00:10:50,388 --> 00:10:52,154
- I'll send you videos.

243
00:10:57,662 --> 00:10:59,929
- Yo, queef, sick party!

244
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:01,330
- Thank you, my friend.

245
00:11:01,332 --> 00:11:03,599
I hope you're enjoying
the delicious libations

246
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:05,835
and jovial atmosphere, yeah?

247
00:11:05,837 --> 00:11:07,136
- How did you get your parents

248
00:11:07,138 --> 00:11:08,304
to let you have the house
all weekend?

249
00:11:08,306 --> 00:11:09,972
- Not even a problem, brother.

250
00:11:09,974 --> 00:11:13,676
You see, I have an open dialogue
with mata and pita.

251
00:11:13,678 --> 00:11:15,077
They respect me as an adult,

252
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:19,048
and they trust
my wise decisions.

253
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,651
- I just threw up
in this genie bottle.

254
00:11:22,653 --> 00:11:25,254
- That's my grandmother!

255
00:11:25,256 --> 00:11:26,822
- Let her out, man.

256
00:11:26,824 --> 00:11:28,991
Let her out!

257
00:11:28,993 --> 00:11:32,928
- ♪ I was like, "excuse me
and my awkward approach" ♪

258
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,231
- hey, this is my personal hell.

259
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:36,499
- Shit, shit.

260
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:37,633
- Aw, that's adorable.

261
00:11:37,635 --> 00:11:39,034
You're still obsessed with her.

262
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:41,170
- No, I'm not still
obsessed with her.

263
00:11:41,172 --> 00:11:42,037
- Yes, you are.

264
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,339
When is her birthday?

265
00:11:43,341 --> 00:11:44,874
- january 15th, 1996.

266
00:11:44,876 --> 00:11:46,242
Nice try.
Everyone knows that.

267
00:11:46,244 --> 00:11:47,843
- Well, no one give's a fuck
about me,

268
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:50,346
so only you should know,
when's my birthday?

269
00:11:50,348 --> 00:11:52,081
- Um...

270
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,783
Today?

271
00:11:53,785 --> 00:11:54,785
My god, today.

272
00:11:54,786 --> 00:11:56,819
Happy birthday, happy birthday!

273
00:11:56,821 --> 00:12:00,156
All: Happy birthday!

274
00:12:00,158 --> 00:12:02,358
- I fucking hate you.

275
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,661
- Listen, this is
my last chance.

276
00:12:05,663 --> 00:12:08,497
Janie is moving down to florida
at the end of the school year.

277
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:09,565
- My god.
- I know.

278
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:11,000
- No way.
- Yes.

279
00:12:11,002 --> 00:12:12,468
- My god, that means
you're only gonna have

280
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,502
christmas break and spring break

281
00:12:13,504 --> 00:12:14,670
to not fuck her.

282
00:12:14,672 --> 00:12:16,038
- False, because I have to go

283
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,640
visit my stupid,
dying grandparents

284
00:12:17,642 --> 00:12:19,642
in arizona for christmas.
Boring.

285
00:12:19,644 --> 00:12:21,577
Then I'm hitting up cancun
with the pussy posse

286
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:23,045
for spring break.

287
00:12:23,047 --> 00:12:24,413
- I'm sorry, what the fuck
did you just say?

288
00:12:24,415 --> 00:12:25,281
Pussy posse?

289
00:12:25,283 --> 00:12:26,482
- It's my cornell boys.

290
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:27,850
- That's so cute.

291
00:12:27,852 --> 00:12:29,151
You know, if you ever
use that nickname again,

292
00:12:29,153 --> 00:12:30,453
I'm gonna punch you
in the penis.

293
00:12:30,455 --> 00:12:31,754
- Okay, you're being
very aggressive.

294
00:12:31,756 --> 00:12:33,088
Just hear me out.

295
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,824
This is my last shot

296
00:12:34,826 --> 00:12:38,961
before she is
out of my life forever.

297
00:12:38,963 --> 00:12:41,063
- Okay, um, look,

298
00:12:41,065 --> 00:12:42,865
I'm gonna try really,
really hard

299
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:43,966
not to be a dick here,

300
00:12:43,968 --> 00:12:45,034
because I can tell you're, like,

301
00:12:45,036 --> 00:12:46,235
really sensitive and everything.

302
00:12:46,237 --> 00:12:48,103
She was not into you
in high school.

303
00:12:48,105 --> 00:12:49,939
She's not into you now.

304
00:12:49,941 --> 00:12:51,740
And she's never
gonna be into you.

305
00:12:51,742 --> 00:12:56,078
But I just... you know, I feel
like it's time we move on.

306
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,246
- Okay.

307
00:12:57,248 --> 00:12:58,113
Okay, yeah.

308
00:12:58,115 --> 00:12:59,315
Yeah, I guess you're right.

309
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:00,349
You're right.

310
00:13:00,351 --> 00:13:01,183
- Shit, you, like...

311
00:13:01,185 --> 00:13:02,852
You handled that really well.

312
00:13:02,854 --> 00:13:04,420
- Psych, no,
I'm fucking with you.

313
00:13:04,422 --> 00:13:07,122
She's totally gonna
sit on my face later, like...

314
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:11,227
- Wow, that's really not
how that goes down at all,

315
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:12,795
so it's clear
you've never done that.

316
00:13:12,797 --> 00:13:14,830
- Yes, I have, I've eaten out,
like, 17 pussies.

317
00:13:14,832 --> 00:13:16,098
Or 23.
I don't know.

318
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,733
I know it's a prime number.

319
00:13:17,735 --> 00:13:19,401
- God, please stop doing that.

320
00:13:19,403 --> 00:13:20,403
Did you spit?

321
00:13:20,404 --> 00:13:21,804
- Yes.
- That's disgusting.

322
00:13:21,806 --> 00:13:23,072
- A little bit.
- Don't spit.

323
00:13:23,074 --> 00:13:24,573
Where did the straw come from?

324
00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:25,608
- My backpack.

325
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,909
- You have a fucking backpack?

326
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,911
- Yes, I have a backpack.

327
00:13:27,912 --> 00:13:28,912
It's an adventure.

328
00:13:28,913 --> 00:13:30,613

This party is ♪lame.

I've only been roofied and
fingered, like, twice tonight.

00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:37,553
I mean, what is this,
a bar mitzvah?

332
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:39,889
- Let's hit up that party
on oak street.

333
00:13:39,891 --> 00:13:42,124
I heard ethyl's gonna be there!

- Ew, is that your grandma?

335
00:13:43,794 --> 00:13:45,394
No offense,
but last time I saw her,

336
00:13:45,396 --> 00:13:48,163
she pretended to trip and
grabbed my cooch for balance.

337
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:51,200
- My dad is always tripping.

338
00:13:51,202 --> 00:13:53,636
- No, you stupid fucking dumb
ecuadorian bitch!

339
00:13:53,638 --> 00:13:54,904
Ethyl's that new hybrid drug

340
00:13:54,906 --> 00:13:56,305
everybody's been
blah-blah-ing about.

It's molly mixed

It's supposed to be totes cray.

- Well, anyone who would do that
is totes retar.

She's learning!

haven't we been doing
too many drugs lately?

Holy shit,

that stupid midterm

00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:04,700
for the day
after thanksgiving break?

- Yup.

Turns out he's not only a perv,

00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:10,272
he's also a fascist.

I mean, I aced...
I aced draper's class.

00:16:14,145 --> 00:16:15,644
I knocked that midterm
out of the park.

394
00:16:15,646 --> 00:16:17,913
I remember he actually
said to me, and I quote,

395
00:16:17,915 --> 00:16:20,249
"you made that midterm
your bitch."

396
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:22,685
Or, no... or he said,
"you did a good job."

397
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:24,186
But he meant it, so...

398
00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:25,721
I mean, don't worry.

399
00:16:25,723 --> 00:16:27,156
No charge.

400
00:16:27,158 --> 00:16:29,858
Just two study buddies
doing what they do,

401
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,026
shooting the shit.

402
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:32,327
Whip out a highlighter or two,

403
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:34,496
make some marks
on those textbooks.

404
00:16:34,498 --> 00:16:38,734
I don't give a fuck

00:16:42,373 --> 00:16:44,006

408
00:16:44,008 --> 00:16:45,140
Yeah, yes.

409
00:16:45,142 --> 00:16:47,042
So you will not regret this.

00:16:47,044 --> 00:16:48,177

00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:57,086
Okay.

I love you, so much.

418
00:17:04,895 --> 00:17:06,595
But I feel totally fine.

419
00:17:06,597 --> 00:17:08,864
- Yeah, no, you look
totally great,

420
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:10,132
not at all like a rhino

421
00:17:10,134 --> 00:17:12,401

424
00:17:23,013 --> 00:17:26,615
I feel so much better now.

425
00:17:26,617 --> 00:17:28,317
Want to hook up?

426
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,953

427
00:17:30,955 --> 00:17:31,955

No.

431
00:17:36,727 --> 00:17:37,860

432
00:17:37,862 --> 00:17:39,228
So I'm gonna go now.

433
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,230

434
00:17:40,231 --> 00:17:41,231
did you not hear me?

435
00:17:41,232 --> 00:17:42,464
She said yes.

436
00:17:42,466 --> 00:17:44,533
- My god, that is so exciting.

437
00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:46,201
Hey, at what point
in this conversation

438
00:17:46,203 --> 00:17:48,971
are we going to acknowledge
that I'm covered in vomit?

439
00:17:48,973 --> 00:17:50,038
- What am I gonna wear?

440
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,840
Should I wear a suit?

441
00:17:51,842 --> 00:17:54,343
Maybe one of those
sexy-ass tight vests

442
00:17:54,345 --> 00:17:56,044
with, like, a dragon on it
for no fucking reason.

443
00:17:56,046 --> 00:17:57,479
And she's like, "what's that?"

444
00:17:57,481 --> 00:17:58,914
And I'm like,
don't worry about it.

445
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,582
But I don't know
where to take her for dinner,

446
00:18:00,584 --> 00:18:02,117
because I obviously want
to take her somewhere nice,

447
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:04,286
but I don't want
to freak her out.

448
00:18:04,288 --> 00:18:05,954
- There's about ten
different restaurants

449
00:18:05,956 --> 00:18:07,089
up in that girl's vomit,

450
00:18:07,091 --> 00:18:09,424
so you can take your pick.

451
00:18:11,796 --> 00:18:12,828
- Text me.

452
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,997
- Suck a dick.

453
00:18:14,999 --> 00:18:16,799
- No.

454
00:18:29,914 --> 00:18:31,513
- Shit, look, I'm sorry,

455
00:18:31,515 --> 00:18:34,716
but you came out of nowhere.

456
00:18:34,718 --> 00:18:37,553
Scott?

457
00:18:37,555 --> 00:18:39,087
- Do I know you?

458
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:42,858
- We went to
high school together.

459
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,092
And middle school,

460
00:18:44,094 --> 00:18:48,130

You look kind of good now.

465
00:18:53,704 --> 00:18:54,803
You know, that nickname

466
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:57,139
might not even be
that ironic anymore.

467
00:18:57,141 --> 00:18:58,540
- Charming, okay.

468
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,342
Well, you're not dead,
so I'm gonna go.

469
00:19:00,344 --> 00:19:02,144
But this has been so fun.

470
00:19:02,146 --> 00:19:03,679
Thank you.

471
00:19:05,482 --> 00:19:07,382
Fuck.

472
00:19:07,384 --> 00:19:10,586
Can I get a ride?

473
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:17,392
So you know this is
a really bad idea, right?

474
00:19:17,394 --> 00:19:19,428
- It says the party is
only one mile from here.

475
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,830
- Fantastic,
I'm glad there's an app

476
00:19:20,831 --> 00:19:22,631
that can make stalking
more efficient.

477
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:24,266
- I'm not stalking, okay?

478
00:19:24,268 --> 00:19:26,735
I'm merely using technology
to help me locate someone

479
00:19:26,737 --> 00:19:29,771
who doesn't want to talk to me
at the moment.

480
00:19:29,773 --> 00:19:30,773
Which is stalking.

481
00:19:31,842 --> 00:19:34,009
- Ooh, make that left.

482
00:19:34,011 --> 00:19:37,679
- You do realize that
you're pathetic, right?

483
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:41,783
- You do realize that
you're covered in vomit, right?

484
00:19:41,785 --> 00:19:43,785
Besides, heather's
gonna take me back.

485
00:19:43,787 --> 00:19:46,054
- Fantastic, so not only
are you a stalker,

486
00:19:46,056 --> 00:19:47,289
but you're a misogynist too.

487
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,690
- And I'm a romantic.

488
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:50,792
- Ho-ho, and why would
heather take you back?

489
00:19:50,794 --> 00:19:52,327
'Cause I think she's
made it perfectly clear

490
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:54,663
that she wants nothing
to do with you.

491
00:19:54,665 --> 00:19:56,098
- She just needs
some time to think

492
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,232
and, you know, reevaluate.

493
00:19:57,234 --> 00:19:58,234
She'll be fine.

494
00:19:58,235 --> 00:19:59,735
- Wow.

495
00:19:59,737 --> 00:20:02,404
Because obviously she must be
in a weird mental place

496
00:20:02,406 --> 00:20:05,674
to dump you, mr. perfect
with the amazing hair.

497
00:20:05,676 --> 00:20:07,109
- Think I have amazing hair?

498
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:08,443
- My god,
you know you're attractive.

499
00:20:08,445 --> 00:20:09,845
It's annoying.

500
00:20:09,847 --> 00:20:12,314
- Wow, amazing hair
and I'm attractive?

501
00:20:12,316 --> 00:20:14,016
- Yeah, here I go.

502
00:20:14,018 --> 00:20:15,317
- Wait a minute.

503
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,652
Are you into me?

504
00:20:16,654 --> 00:20:18,720
- No, god, I'm not into you.

505
00:20:18,722 --> 00:20:20,622
I mean, would I have sex
with you?

506
00:20:20,624 --> 00:20:23,525
Yeah, probably, but that does
not mean that I'm into you.

507
00:20:23,527 --> 00:20:25,627
- You'd have sex with me?

508
00:20:27,631 --> 00:20:29,164
Wow, I mean, I'm not surprised.

509
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,999
I'm just surprised
that you actually admitted that.

510
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:32,668
- My god, it's 2014.

511
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,536
Women should be able
to openly talk about sex.

512
00:20:34,538 --> 00:20:35,971
- I mean, I know
what year it is.

513
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:37,306
I'm just saying...

514
00:20:37,308 --> 00:20:38,573
- Okay, here's the thing,
prom king.

515
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:39,875
Women think about sex
all the time,

516
00:20:39,877 --> 00:20:41,677
including your precious,
wonderful heather.

517
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,612
So if she wanted you in her bed,

518
00:20:43,614 --> 00:20:45,547
you wouldn't be in this car
with me right now.

519
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:49,217
And that is a fact.

520
00:20:49,219 --> 00:20:50,919
Wait, hold on one second,

521
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:52,788
because I really want
to film this,

522
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:57,125
because fail videos
always go viral.

523
00:20:57,127 --> 00:20:59,161
Go on.

524
00:20:59,163 --> 00:21:00,262
- Yeah, I don't know.

525
00:21:00,264 --> 00:21:01,330
Maybe now isn't the best time.

526
00:21:01,332 --> 00:21:02,497
- No, come on, scott.

527
00:21:02,499 --> 00:21:03,932
The internet wants to see you

528
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:07,069
get kicked in the balls
really bad.

529
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:08,870
- Why are you so mean?

530
00:21:08,872 --> 00:21:10,272
- I'm mean?

531
00:21:10,274 --> 00:21:11,940
Wow, that's a double standard.

532
00:21:11,942 --> 00:21:14,276
I recall it going a little bit
differently in high school.

533
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:17,245
Maybe nobody has told you
that high school is over.

534
00:21:17,247 --> 00:21:19,214
That big ceremony thing
that we all did,

535
00:21:19,216 --> 00:21:20,449
that was graduation,

536
00:21:20,451 --> 00:21:21,516
where we all move on

537
00:21:21,518 --> 00:21:22,784
and we all do different things.

538
00:21:22,786 --> 00:21:24,152
You don't stay here and be like,

539
00:21:24,154 --> 00:21:25,420
"I was prom king; I'm cool,

540
00:21:25,422 --> 00:21:26,588
so that means
I'm cool forever."

541
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,090
Nobody gives a shit.

542
00:21:28,092 --> 00:21:30,692
So maybe it's time
that you try something new.

543
00:21:30,694 --> 00:21:32,194
Try something
a little bit different,

544
00:21:32,196 --> 00:21:34,062
'cause obviously this whole...

545
00:21:47,277 --> 00:21:48,877
- Wait, wait.

546
00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:51,513
I don't have any condoms on me.

547
00:21:53,784 --> 00:21:55,017
Who are you?

548
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:56,418
- tori the whorie.

549
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,586
- Yeah,
I came up with that name.

550
00:21:57,588 --> 00:21:59,855
- Yeah, you're an asshole.

551
00:22:04,895 --> 00:22:07,362
- tori the whorie
is back, bitch!

552
00:22:07,364 --> 00:22:08,530
- Okay, first of all,

553
00:22:08,532 --> 00:22:09,965
she never existed.

554
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:12,434
Second of all, it was a mistake.

555
00:22:12,436 --> 00:22:16,038
It was a big, stupid mistake.

556
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,639
- How big?

557
00:22:17,641 --> 00:22:18,607
- What?

558
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:19,975
- Come on, girl,
give me something.

559
00:22:19,977 --> 00:22:22,077
I haven't looked at porn
since I got home.

560
00:22:23,113 --> 00:22:24,246
It was huge, enormous.

561
00:22:24,248 --> 00:22:25,414
And he put it in my butt

562
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:26,882
and slapped me in my face
with it.

563
00:22:26,884 --> 00:22:29,017
- I know you're lying, but...

564
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:30,152
Thank you.

565
00:22:30,154 --> 00:22:32,320
- I just... I really want
to forget about it.

566
00:22:32,322 --> 00:22:34,189
- So you're not
gonna see him again?

567
00:22:34,191 --> 00:22:35,590
- No, it was a one-time thing.

568
00:22:35,592 --> 00:22:37,325
I'm never talking
to that douche again.

569
00:22:38,328 --> 00:22:40,128
And does he know that?

570
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,363
- Please.

571
00:22:41,365 --> 00:22:43,298
Scott is so far up his own ass,

572
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,766
he won't even notice.

573
00:22:44,768 --> 00:22:47,402
- How far?

574
00:22:50,274 --> 00:22:51,473
- Here's the turkey.

575
00:22:51,475 --> 00:22:52,541
Here's the bird.

576
00:23:08,025 --> 00:23:10,759
Hey, I'm sorry you guys
got stuck over here.

577
00:23:10,761 --> 00:23:14,029
- Hey, at least we don't
have to sit with crazy aunt flo.

578
00:23:14,031 --> 00:23:16,064
- Did I ever tell you
about the time

579
00:23:16,066 --> 00:23:17,766
I got abducted by aliens?

580
00:23:17,768 --> 00:23:19,835
Funny story, actually.

581
00:23:21,171 --> 00:23:23,071
Their queen impregnated me,

582
00:23:23,073 --> 00:23:28,543
and the baby grew to full size
in less than eight hours.

583
00:23:28,545 --> 00:23:31,480
And then it ate its way
out of my uterus.

584
00:23:31,482 --> 00:23:33,014
Want to see the scar?

585
00:23:35,486 --> 00:23:37,285
- Why can't we just have
an alcoholic aunt

586
00:23:37,287 --> 00:23:39,087
like every other family?

587
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:43,158
- Today, you can consider me
an alcoholic father.

588
00:23:47,431 --> 00:23:50,298
- Hey, you remember
tori the whorie?

589
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,136
- The girl whose pimples
used to pop in the sunlight?

590
00:23:54,138 --> 00:23:55,170
- That was graphic.

591
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:56,271
Yes.

592
00:23:56,273 --> 00:23:57,273
You should see her now.

593
00:23:57,274 --> 00:23:58,373
She looks totally different.

594
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,808
- No thanks.

595
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,876
- No, seriously, look.

596
00:24:00,878 --> 00:24:02,077
She's, like, photoshopped.

597
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,278
- No, seriously,

598
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,348
I'm not interested
in your dumb little crush.

599
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,716
- I don't have a crush.

600
00:24:07,718 --> 00:24:09,384
I mean, that's ridiculous.

601
00:24:09,386 --> 00:24:11,486
- You know what else
is ridiculous?

602
00:24:11,488 --> 00:24:12,954
"Modern medicine."

603
00:24:12,956 --> 00:24:15,524
I mean, why do I need a "doctor"

604
00:24:15,526 --> 00:24:17,092
to tell me that I'm "crazy"

605
00:24:17,094 --> 00:24:19,661
and a "danger to myself
and others"?

606
00:24:19,663 --> 00:24:21,429
I mean, hello?

607
00:24:21,431 --> 00:24:24,833
I already have the voices
in my head telling me that.

608
00:24:27,938 --> 00:24:30,906
I can't kill them.
They're family.

609
00:24:35,846 --> 00:24:38,513
- You know mental illness
runs in our family, right?

610
00:24:38,515 --> 00:24:42,250
- Hey, as long as baldness
doesn't, then I'm fine.

611
00:24:43,654 --> 00:24:45,687
- But what I'm most thankful for

612
00:24:45,689 --> 00:24:48,890
is joining
this wonderful family.

613
00:24:48,892 --> 00:24:52,961
I feel like the luckiest man
in western p.a.

614
00:24:52,963 --> 00:24:54,996
Aw, heck, in the entire state
of pennsylvania.

615
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,101
- marissa, honey, what are you
most thankful for?

616
00:25:00,103 --> 00:25:04,906
Well, other than this
beautiful treasure of a man.

617
00:25:04,908 --> 00:25:06,408
- I don't even know
where to begin.

618
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,676
- Great, next.

619
00:25:07,678 --> 00:25:08,910
- I'm thankful that my paintings

620
00:25:08,912 --> 00:25:11,413
were selected
to hang at the met.

621
00:25:11,415 --> 00:25:14,149
- You did.

622
00:25:14,151 --> 00:25:17,886
- And that I finally
learned how to drive!

623
00:25:17,888 --> 00:25:19,321
- Yes!

624
00:25:19,323 --> 00:25:20,355
Scary.

625
00:25:20,357 --> 00:25:21,423
- You did.

626
00:25:21,425 --> 00:25:22,757
You're an inspiration, sweetie.

627
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:24,092
- Yeah, no, we get it,
she's perfect.

628
00:25:24,094 --> 00:25:25,760
Now, could somebody please
pass the wine

629
00:25:25,762 --> 00:25:27,963
so I can drink
till I black the fuck out?

630
00:25:27,965 --> 00:25:29,130
- Language!

631
00:25:29,132 --> 00:25:31,666
- Look, I'm real nice
when I'm drunk.

632
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,277
Yeah.

633
00:26:08,372 --> 00:26:10,138
- Aw, she's pretty.

634
00:26:12,142 --> 00:26:13,475
How did you get in here?

635
00:26:13,477 --> 00:26:15,277
- The real question is,

636
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:20,015
how did we get here?

637
00:26:20,017 --> 00:26:21,383
P'shoo!

638
00:26:25,656 --> 00:26:27,522
What?

639
00:26:27,524 --> 00:26:30,025
- I hope you like it.

640
00:26:30,027 --> 00:26:32,927
- I can't believe
you made this from scratch.

641
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:36,631
- Who wants to play
dance central?

642
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:37,699
I do!

643
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:39,100
- I want to kill myself.

644
00:26:39,102 --> 00:26:40,102
- Yay!

645
00:26:40,103 --> 00:26:41,136
Let's play.

646
00:26:42,205 --> 00:26:46,041
- Hey, tore,
can you get the door?

647
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:50,245
- Gil, you are so clever.

648
00:26:50,247 --> 00:26:51,346
- What can I say?

649
00:26:51,348 --> 00:26:53,415
She's rubbing off on me.

650
00:26:53,417 --> 00:26:56,318
- Okay, well,
if I'm not back in five,

651
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,419
assume that I'm dead,

652
00:26:57,421 --> 00:26:58,953
and don't come looking for me.

653
00:26:58,955 --> 00:27:01,256
- Okeydokey, honey.

654
00:27:01,258 --> 00:27:05,960
Yeah, gil,
you should try<i> my</i> pie.

655

- Did you run here?

658
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:14,169

659
00:27:14,171 --> 00:27:15,470
and you weren't
answering your phone.

660
00:27:15,472 --> 00:27:16,905
- Yeah, it's thanksgiving,

661
00:27:16,907 --> 00:27:18,306
and my mom makes us
put our phones and beepers

sit down to the table.

664

- Gil.

665
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:23,678
- I'm a doctor!

666
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,681
- Orthodontist!

667
00:27:26,683 --> 00:27:29,451
So you wanted something?

668
00:27:29,453 --> 00:27:30,618
- When we had sex last night...

669
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,754
- My god, dude.

670
00:27:32,756 --> 00:27:35,290
My parents are, like,
right in there.

671

- Sorry.

672
00:27:37,561 --> 00:27:39,060
When we had sex last night...

673
00:27:40,664 --> 00:27:42,797

674
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,734

675

- Come on, I'm serious.

676
00:27:46,803 --> 00:27:48,837

Please do not say things

You're, like,
so stuck in high school.

682
00:27:57,114 --> 00:27:58,546
It's really frightening.

683
00:27:58,548 --> 00:28:00,148
- You can't say
you didn't feel anything.

684
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,483
- I mean, I thought
it was pretty clear

685
00:28:01,485 --> 00:28:04,619
that we were just two
sad, horny adults

686
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:06,020
getting some in a car.

687
00:28:06,022 --> 00:28:08,189
It was just sex, nothing more.

Okay, look, I get it.

689

You're like...
Your girlfriend dumps you,

690
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,296
and then you randomly
hook up with me,

691
00:28:15,298 --> 00:28:17,565
and you're, like,
all confused and shit.

00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:19,200
And I understand.

693
00:28:19,202 --> 00:28:21,002
But I think it's best
if you just, like,

694
00:28:21,004 --> 00:28:23,405

altogether, okay?

strapping young man?

she's gonna think
that you're trying to bang her.

820
00:33:40,657 --> 00:33:41,789
- But I am.

821
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:43,024
- Yes, I know.

822
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:46,994
But the key is
to make her forget that.

823
00:33:46,996 --> 00:33:48,830
- Good note.

824
00:33:53,136 --> 00:33:54,969
- Hey, tori.

825
00:33:54,971 --> 00:33:57,338
- What the fuck?

826
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,173
- Hey, crazy, right?

827
00:34:00,643 --> 00:34:03,544
- Um, hey, I just want
to say sorry

828
00:34:03,546 --> 00:34:05,880
for coming to your family's
dinner last night.

829
00:34:05,882 --> 00:34:08,015
That was...
I shouldn't have done that.

830
00:34:08,017 --> 00:34:09,417
It was inappropriate.

831
00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:12,320
- Yeah, you know what else
is inappropriate?

832
00:34:12,322 --> 00:34:14,822
You stalking
my instagram account

833
00:34:14,824 --> 00:34:16,457
and following me here.

834
00:34:16,459 --> 00:34:19,026
- Does this look too, like,
"ooh, I did anal once,

835
00:34:19,028 --> 00:34:21,028
and now it's all I want"?

836
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,730
Scott.

837
00:34:22,732 --> 00:34:24,132
Did janie send you?

838
00:34:24,134 --> 00:34:26,934
- What?
No, why would she?

839
00:34:26,936 --> 00:34:28,436
- No reason.

840
00:34:31,508 --> 00:34:32,306
- Okay.

841
00:34:32,308 --> 00:34:34,542
So back to you stalking me.

842
00:34:34,544 --> 00:34:36,878
- Aw, you thought
I'm stalking you?

843
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,312
No, I was just taking pictures
in the mall,

844
00:34:38,314 --> 00:34:39,747
and I saw you
through the window.

845
00:34:39,749 --> 00:34:42,383
- 'Cause that doesn't
sound creepy.

846
00:34:44,721 --> 00:34:47,088
- I like shooting
all the black friday craziness.

847
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,289
Usually get
some pretty cool stuff.

848
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:49,557
I mean, for the most part,

849
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:52,894
it's just random people
getting tasered.

850
00:34:52,896 --> 00:34:54,862
- All right, let me see that.

851
00:35:03,106 --> 00:35:07,108
Dude, this is fucked up.

852
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,277
Would you send these to me?

853
00:35:11,681 --> 00:35:14,816
Aw.

854
00:35:14,818 --> 00:35:19,086
I found your fetish.

855
00:35:19,088 --> 00:35:21,322
It's not a fetish.

856
00:35:21,324 --> 00:35:23,424
- Hey, look close.

857
00:35:23,426 --> 00:35:25,126
You see how that old couple
is sitting perfectly

858
00:35:25,128 --> 00:35:28,029
right between that trash can
and that stained glass window

859
00:35:28,031 --> 00:35:29,230
and that fountain?

860
00:35:29,232 --> 00:35:31,265
It's like...

861
00:35:31,267 --> 00:35:33,801
It's kind of like beauty
meets its opposite.

862
00:35:33,803 --> 00:35:35,236
You know?

863
00:35:35,238 --> 00:35:36,971
Amidst all the craziness
of black friday

864
00:35:36,973 --> 00:35:40,141
and everybody's
freaking out around them,

865
00:35:40,143 --> 00:35:41,943
they're safe, you know?

866
00:35:41,945 --> 00:35:46,180
They found their little place
to go and share a kiss.

867
00:35:46,182 --> 00:35:49,050
It's kind of cute, beautiful.

868
00:35:49,052 --> 00:35:51,919
- My god.

869
00:35:51,921 --> 00:35:54,455
I didn't sleep
with the cool guy.

870
00:35:54,457 --> 00:35:56,691
I slept with
the formerly cool guy

871
00:35:56,693 --> 00:36:01,229
who's actually
a big frickin' dork.

872
00:36:01,231 --> 00:36:02,463
I'm not a dork.

873
00:36:02,465 --> 00:36:03,497
I'm cool.

874
00:36:03,499 --> 00:36:04,966
- I'm currently cool.

875
00:36:04,968 --> 00:36:06,067
- Okay.

876
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:07,368
So then, just tell me

877
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:09,837
one currently cool thing
that you've done

878
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,906
post-graduation.

879
00:36:17,313 --> 00:36:20,314
What are you doing later?

880
00:36:20,316 --> 00:36:21,482
- I don't know, why?

881
00:36:21,484 --> 00:36:23,050
- 'Cause we're hanging out.

882
00:36:23,052 --> 00:36:25,386
Really?

883
00:36:25,388 --> 00:36:26,454
- All right.

884
00:36:26,456 --> 00:36:27,488
- But I am driving,

885
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:28,823
and I am planning everything.

886
00:36:28,825 --> 00:36:32,159
And you have to do
everything that I say.

887
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:35,062
- All right, deal.

888
00:36:35,064 --> 00:36:36,464
- All right.

889
00:36:36,466 --> 00:36:38,499
Now go continue taking
those creepy pictures,

890
00:36:38,501 --> 00:36:40,167
and quit stalking me.

891
00:36:40,169 --> 00:36:42,136

Okay, what is this,
some kind of bucket list?

898
00:37:36,426 --> 00:37:38,025
- Yeah, except
you don't die in it.

899
00:37:38,027 --> 00:37:40,328

You're like, so regimented.

I mean, everything about you

So, what I'm gonna do

906
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,407
is just loosen you up
a little bit.

907
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:56,610
- I'm not shaving my head.

908
00:37:56,612 --> 00:37:59,380
- Okay, one thing at a time.

909
00:37:59,382 --> 00:38:00,548
- Seriously, I'm not doing it.

910
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,682
- That's what I'm talking about.

911
00:38:01,684 --> 00:38:03,150
You're so regimented.

912
00:38:03,152 --> 00:38:04,518
- Look at it.
- I see it.

913
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,519
- Look at the way it flows.

914
00:38:05,521 --> 00:38:06,554
- No, yeah, I see it.

915
00:38:06,556 --> 00:38:08,089
- Look at how it moves.

916
00:38:08,091 --> 00:38:09,824
- You know what, this is
exactly what I'm talking about.

917
00:38:09,826 --> 00:38:15,096
You're so set in your little
perfect scott hair ways.

918
00:38:15,098 --> 00:38:17,465
- Fine, okay, can we just do
something a little easier

919
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:18,899
to ease me into it?

920
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:19,934
- Yeah, absolutely.

921
00:38:19,936 --> 00:38:21,168
I thought we should
probably start

922
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,471
with number four.

923
00:38:27,243 --> 00:38:28,242
- No, I'm not gonna do that.

924
00:38:28,244 --> 00:38:29,244
- Yeah.
- No.

925
00:38:29,245 --> 00:38:30,245
- You certainly are.

926
00:38:30,246 --> 00:38:31,512
- No fucking way.

927
00:38:31,514 --> 00:38:32,913
- No, you're gonna do it.
- No.

928
00:38:38,621 --> 00:38:40,721
- Seriously, just poop already.

929
00:38:40,723 --> 00:38:42,490
- I'm trying, okay?

930
00:38:42,492 --> 00:38:43,557
I have a sensitive stomach.

931
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:45,226
- My god.

932
00:38:45,228 --> 00:38:46,394
- Turn around.

933
00:38:46,396 --> 00:38:47,495
- What?

934
00:38:47,497 --> 00:38:48,497
- Turn around.

935
00:38:48,498 --> 00:38:49,897
- Seriously?

936
00:38:49,899 --> 00:38:51,165
This is ridiculous.

937
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:52,633
- Plug your ears.

938
00:38:52,635 --> 00:38:54,468
- What are you doing?
- It's gonna be loud.

939
00:38:58,207 --> 00:38:59,340
- scott?

940
00:38:59,342 --> 00:39:00,474

944
00:39:06,182 --> 00:39:09,216
Get the fuck in the car!

945
00:39:11,754 --> 00:39:14,388

into poop stuff

946
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,357

for it when it's rape.

00:41:16,179 --> 00:41:18,145
That wasn't that bad.

985
00:41:18,147 --> 00:41:21,348
- I guess it wasn't.

986
00:41:22,718 --> 00:41:25,019
Is anyone else
losing their vision?

987
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:31,525
At least he didn't
pierce your dick.

988
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:37,498
- I'm not really
a pot kind of guy.

989
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,566
- You know what, that's fine.

990
00:41:38,568 --> 00:41:39,667
I'll get the clippers.

991
00:41:39,669 --> 00:41:40,968
- Give me that fucking brownie.

992
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,236
- My god.

993
00:41:42,238 --> 00:41:43,971
- Okay, what if it makes me
all chatty and paranoid

994
00:41:43,973 --> 00:41:45,472
and annoying?

995
00:41:45,474 --> 00:41:47,341
- My gosh, then we're gonna
know that it didn't work.

996
00:41:47,343 --> 00:41:48,509
- Is it gluten-free?

997
00:41:48,511 --> 00:41:50,010
I have a really
sensitive stomach.

998
00:41:50,012 --> 00:41:51,612
- My god, I know you have
a sensitive everything.

999
00:41:51,614 --> 00:41:53,581
Yes, it's gluten-free.

1000
00:41:58,354 --> 00:42:00,588
My god.

1001
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,689
- That's fucking good.

1002
00:42:01,691 --> 00:42:02,691
- I know.

1003
00:42:02,692 --> 00:42:03,624
- That's real good.

1004
00:42:03,626 --> 00:42:06,493
- Isn't that good?

1005
00:42:06,495 --> 00:42:08,562
- I think I'm high.

1006
00:42:12,068 --> 00:42:15,302
<i>- ♪ We have fun, we have fun ♪</i>

1007
00:42:15,304 --> 00:42:19,607

00:42:23,212 --> 00:42:24,878

- your car broke down,

1013
00:42:50,673 --> 00:42:53,274
so you rented a party bus?

1014
00:42:54,777 --> 00:42:56,777
- I did, yeah.

1015
00:42:56,779 --> 00:42:58,078
Every once in a while,

1016
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,614
it's just nice
to treat yourself.

1017
00:43:00,616 --> 00:43:02,383
- Quit the bullshit, joel.

1018
00:43:02,385 --> 00:43:03,550
What's going on?

1019
00:43:03,552 --> 00:43:05,919
- No bullshit.
Nothing is going on,

1020
00:43:05,921 --> 00:43:09,857
besides the start
of our glorious evening.

1021
00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:12,793
- No sex in the car, kids.

1022
00:43:12,795 --> 00:43:14,194
Last thing I want to see

1023
00:43:14,196 --> 00:43:16,430
is two underage,

1024
00:43:16,432 --> 00:43:17,865
semi-ethnic-looking,

1025
00:43:17,867 --> 00:43:20,301
possibly native american
teenagers

1026
00:43:20,303 --> 00:43:24,104
making a mess on my
brand-new pleather interior,

1027
00:43:24,106 --> 00:43:26,807
forcing me to
lap, lap, lap it up

1028
00:43:26,809 --> 00:43:30,678
like a golden retriever
on a hot-ass day.

1029
00:43:32,081 --> 00:43:34,481
Fuck.

1030
00:43:34,483 --> 00:43:36,350
- Well, I feel safe.

1031
00:43:36,352 --> 00:43:37,451
- don't worry about her.

1032
00:43:37,453 --> 00:43:38,552
I'll kick her ass.

1033
00:43:38,554 --> 00:43:40,020
I'm here for you.

1034
00:43:40,022 --> 00:43:41,722
- joel, I don't have time
for this.

1035
00:43:41,724 --> 00:43:43,924
I have 200 years
of european history

1036
00:43:43,926 --> 00:43:45,259
to memorize by monday.

1037
00:43:45,261 --> 00:43:47,895
- Which is why
I am going to help you

1038
00:43:47,897 --> 00:43:50,931
connect those boring,
mundane facts

1039
00:43:50,933 --> 00:43:53,400
to ideas that are
personal to you.

1040
00:43:53,402 --> 00:43:55,903
- How?

1041
00:43:55,905 --> 00:43:57,771
- Okay, champagne.

1042
00:43:57,773 --> 00:43:59,640
What do you think of
when you drink champagne?

1043
00:43:59,642 --> 00:44:01,742
- Old people, headaches.

1044
00:44:01,744 --> 00:44:03,877
- Okay, perfect,
let's go with headaches.

1045
00:44:03,879 --> 00:44:05,546
Champagne is from france.

1046
00:44:05,548 --> 00:44:09,650
It was originally used
in the coronation of kings.

1047
00:44:09,652 --> 00:44:13,954
King louis xvi
also got a headache

1048
00:44:13,956 --> 00:44:16,957
when he was beheaded
by his own subjects

1049
00:44:16,959 --> 00:44:20,160
on january 21st, 1793,

1050
00:44:20,162 --> 00:44:23,697
during the french revolution.

1051
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:24,932
- Not bad.
- Yeah.

1052
00:44:24,934 --> 00:44:26,266
- Just letting you know

1053
00:44:26,268 --> 00:44:28,936
I'm changing the atmosphere up
a bit.

1054
00:44:33,676 --> 00:44:35,642
Why is my ass getting hot?

1055
00:44:35,644 --> 00:44:37,845
- Seat warmers!

1056
00:44:37,847 --> 00:44:40,347
You're welcome.

1057
00:44:40,349 --> 00:44:42,583
- Well, anyway,
a few mnemonic devices

1058
00:44:42,585 --> 00:44:45,018
won't be enough to get me an "a"
in draper's class.

1059
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,988
- You knew about
mnemonic devices?

1060
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:50,591
- What I don't know
is what to study.

1061
00:44:50,593 --> 00:44:54,194
Draper's cramming way too many
chapters into one test.

1062
00:44:54,196 --> 00:44:57,364
- Well, I don't go back
to cornell

1063
00:44:57,366 --> 00:45:02,136
until sunday, so...

1064
00:45:02,138 --> 00:45:05,939
- And I thought you were
actually gonna help me study.

1065
00:45:08,043 --> 00:45:09,643
Pull over.
- Wait, wait, hold on.

1066
00:45:09,645 --> 00:45:11,412
Hold on.

1067
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:15,349
Would this help?

1068
00:45:18,587 --> 00:45:20,521
- You have the test?

1069
00:45:20,523 --> 00:45:24,057
- Draper uses the same password
for all his secure files.

1070
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:27,394
It's "ariana grande's
puffy nipples 555."

1071
00:45:28,531 --> 00:45:30,497
Well, why didn't you
lead with this

1072
00:45:30,499 --> 00:45:32,633
instead of the lame mnemonic?

1073
00:45:32,635 --> 00:45:35,269
- Well, once you had
the actual test,

1074
00:45:35,271 --> 00:45:38,806
there'd be no reason
for you to hang out with me.

1075
00:45:38,808 --> 00:45:40,841
- joel.

1076
00:45:40,843 --> 00:45:42,376
I still want to hang out
with you.

1077
00:45:42,378 --> 00:45:46,113
I just don't want
to lead you on.

1078
00:45:46,115 --> 00:45:48,649
Like, nothing's gonna happen
between us.

1079
00:45:48,651 --> 00:45:49,817
- Fuck!

1080
00:45:49,819 --> 00:45:51,418
- No, duh, I know that.

1081
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,653
- Yeah.
- Sure.

1082
00:45:52,655 --> 00:45:57,624
- Seriously, like,
it's not gonna happen.

1083
00:45:57,626 --> 00:45:58,992
- Okay, what if you and I

1084
00:45:58,994 --> 00:46:01,028
were stuck on
a deserted island together

1085
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:02,396
and you were getting
super horny.

1086
00:46:02,398 --> 00:46:04,097
You're diddling yourself
every night, sure.

1087
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:06,366
But what you really need
is a penis.

1088
00:46:06,368 --> 00:46:08,302
Now, you're thinking,
"I'll go artificial."

1089
00:46:08,304 --> 00:46:10,103
You're looking for a dildo,
you're looking for a dildo.

1090
00:46:10,105 --> 00:46:11,638
You're searching the island.
You can't find one.

1091
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,106
All of a sudden, you see me.

1092
00:46:13,108 --> 00:46:15,008
I just gave myself
a nice little saltwater bath.

1093
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:16,543
I look great.

1094
00:46:16,545 --> 00:46:17,711
I shoot you a wink.

1095
00:46:17,713 --> 00:46:19,580
What are my chances?

1096
00:46:19,582 --> 00:46:20,948
- Well, in that scenario,

1097
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:23,550
I guess you might
actually have a shot.

1098
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:36,296
Almont?

1099
00:46:36,298 --> 00:46:38,665
I've always wanted to eat here.

1100
00:46:38,667 --> 00:46:41,935
- What a lucky guess.

1101
00:46:41,937 --> 00:46:43,871
- But I'm not dressed for this.

1102
00:46:43,873 --> 00:46:46,106
- I got it covered.

1103
00:47:03,859 --> 00:47:05,058
A-vooga-vooga!

1104
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,560
Heh-la-la-la!

1105
00:47:06,562 --> 00:47:07,961
Yes, please.

1106
00:47:07,963 --> 00:47:09,363
I'm kidding.

1107
00:47:09,365 --> 00:47:11,431
But seriously,
you look really fucking good.

1108
00:47:11,433 --> 00:47:14,868
- joel, I can't believe
you got me this dress.

1109
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,670
I've wanted it for so long.

1110
00:47:16,672 --> 00:47:17,971
- Really?
No way.

1111
00:47:17,973 --> 00:47:19,439
My god, baby.

1112
00:47:19,441 --> 00:47:23,777
Who knew our tastes
were so sympatico?

1113
00:47:23,779 --> 00:47:25,245
- joel...

1114
00:47:25,247 --> 00:47:28,315
- Only on a dildo-less
abandoned island, I know.

1115
00:47:37,726 --> 00:47:39,927
- Fuck.

1116
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:41,828
I think I broke my vagina.

1117
00:47:43,432 --> 00:47:44,932
You know what's good as hell
when you're high?

1118
00:47:44,934 --> 00:47:46,033
- What?

1119
00:47:46,035 --> 00:47:47,301
- Motherfuckin' french fries.

1120
00:47:50,506 --> 00:47:51,905
I can only burp like that
when I'm high.

1121
00:47:51,907 --> 00:47:53,840
- Classy.

1122
00:47:53,842 --> 00:47:55,676
Okay.

1123
00:47:55,678 --> 00:47:57,878
I have something to tell you.

1124
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,012
- You're a lesbian?

1125
00:47:59,014 --> 00:48:00,180
- What?
No.

1126
00:48:00,182 --> 00:48:02,349
Why would you even think that?

1127
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:04,651
- You're the one
that made me buy charlene.

1128
00:48:04,653 --> 00:48:06,553
- My god, you named her?

1129
00:48:06,555 --> 00:48:07,688
- Yeah.

1130
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:10,023
I even gave her a backstory.

1131
00:48:10,025 --> 00:48:12,426
She's had a hell
of a year, charlene.

1132
00:48:12,428 --> 00:48:13,527
Abusive husband.

1133
00:48:13,529 --> 00:48:15,762
Children died in a plane crash.

1134
00:48:15,764 --> 00:48:17,965
Went to rehab a few times.

1135
00:48:17,967 --> 00:48:19,266
Even tried to kill herself.

1136
00:48:19,268 --> 00:48:20,268
- Aw.

1137
00:48:20,269 --> 00:48:21,435
- But she's bouncing back.

1138
00:48:21,437 --> 00:48:24,571
One day at a time,
right, charlene?

1139
00:48:24,573 --> 00:48:26,740
- You're not high.

1140
00:48:26,742 --> 00:48:28,108
- What?

1141
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:29,910
- That's what I had to tell you.

1142
00:48:29,912 --> 00:48:32,579
I just gave you
a plain old brownie.

1143
00:48:32,581 --> 00:48:35,182
There was no weed in it.

1144
00:48:35,184 --> 00:48:37,651
- Was it even gluten-free?

1145
00:48:37,653 --> 00:48:38,785
You bitch.

1146
00:48:38,787 --> 00:48:40,354
- I'm sorry.

1147
00:48:40,356 --> 00:48:41,955
My god, I don't even know
what the fuck gluten is,

1148
00:48:41,957 --> 00:48:43,457
to be honest.

1149
00:48:43,459 --> 00:48:44,925
- The nation's leading killer,
at the moment.

1150
00:48:44,927 --> 00:48:46,560
- Bullshit.
- Yeah.

1151
00:48:46,562 --> 00:48:47,861
Okay, wait a minute.

1152
00:48:47,863 --> 00:48:49,763
If I'm not high, then how
do you explain the fact

1153
00:48:49,765 --> 00:48:51,698
that I've been really fucking
high for the last two hours?

1154
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,966
- It's a placebo effect.

1155
00:48:52,968 --> 00:48:54,267
You had this preconceived notion

1156
00:48:54,269 --> 00:48:56,770
of how you would respond
to the brownie,

1157
00:48:56,772 --> 00:48:58,138
so when you ate the brownie,

1158
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,606
your brain
automatically responded

1159
00:48:59,608 --> 00:49:03,710
as if the chemical reaction
were actually happening.

1160
00:49:03,712 --> 00:49:05,646
- You fake-drugged me?

1161
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:09,483
That's not funny.
- It's kind of funny.

1162
00:49:09,485 --> 00:49:10,817
- No, it's not.
It's fucked up.

1163
00:49:10,819 --> 00:49:12,052
- Well, you know what?

1164
00:49:12,054 --> 00:49:14,154
Then I guess payback's a bitch,

1165
00:49:14,156 --> 00:49:15,156
and we're even.

1166
00:49:15,157 --> 00:49:16,590
- Even for what?

1167
00:49:16,592 --> 00:49:18,091
I've never done anything
this fucked-up to you.

1168
00:49:18,093 --> 00:49:20,794
- Are you serious?

1169
00:49:20,796 --> 00:49:22,129
- Here we go.

1170
00:49:22,131 --> 00:49:24,398
- Yeah, here we go.

1171
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,133
Yeah.

1172
00:49:26,135 --> 00:49:28,568
- Hey, I took that.

1173
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:31,071
It's actually one
of my favorite shots.

1174
00:49:31,073 --> 00:49:32,973
I love the way the light
hits your hair.

1175
00:49:32,975 --> 00:49:34,207
See the natural composition...

1176
00:49:34,209 --> 00:49:35,575
- Fuck your composition.

1177
00:49:35,577 --> 00:49:37,411
That was my life
that you were photographing.

1178
00:49:37,413 --> 00:49:39,880
I mean, do you have any idea
when that was taken?

1179
00:49:39,882 --> 00:49:40,882
- Prom.

1180
00:49:40,883 --> 00:49:42,315
- Yeah, exactly.

1181
00:49:42,317 --> 00:49:44,885
The night that that asshole
from murrysville

1182
00:49:44,887 --> 00:49:46,186
who took my virginity

1183
00:49:46,188 --> 00:49:47,988
decided to stand me up
and tell me

1184
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:50,090
that I was just his dumb
little slam-pig

1185
00:49:50,092 --> 00:49:53,694
whom he wouldn't be seen
in public with.

1186
00:49:53,696 --> 00:49:54,696
- I didn't know.

1187
00:49:54,697 --> 00:49:56,096
- Yeah, no, nobody knew.

1188
00:49:56,098 --> 00:49:57,531
But you still went
and you posted the picture

1189
00:49:57,533 --> 00:49:59,299
like it's just
no big fucking deal,

1190
00:49:59,301 --> 00:50:01,802
because you have absolutely
no idea what it's like

1191
00:50:01,804 --> 00:50:03,704
to be a loser.

1192
00:50:08,744 --> 00:50:11,611
- You want to know a secret?

1193
00:50:11,613 --> 00:50:13,313
This is the first time
on a friday

1194
00:50:13,315 --> 00:50:17,084
I've actually done anything
in, like, months.

1195
00:50:17,086 --> 00:50:19,086
You know what I usually do
on fridays?

1196
00:50:19,088 --> 00:50:21,321
I'll walk you through it.

1197
00:50:21,323 --> 00:50:24,758
I get home from class,
lay in bed,

1198
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,126
and I masturbate,

1199
00:50:26,128 --> 00:50:29,663
like, viciously,

1200
00:50:29,665 --> 00:50:31,164
like, for five hours,

1201
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:32,733
like a marathon.

1202
00:50:32,735 --> 00:50:34,401
God!

1203
00:50:34,403 --> 00:50:35,869
- And then I go to the fridge,

1204
00:50:35,871 --> 00:50:40,674
and I get a bunch of food,
and I eat my feelings.

1205
00:50:40,676 --> 00:50:43,343
Then I go to sleep.

1206
00:50:43,345 --> 00:50:45,712
Every friday night.

1207
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:50,150
I hate college.

1208
00:50:50,152 --> 00:50:51,485
I fucking hate it.

1209
00:50:51,487 --> 00:50:52,686
I hate everything about it.

1210
00:50:52,688 --> 00:50:53,688
I hate my classes.

1211
00:50:53,689 --> 00:50:54,755
I hate my professors.

1212
00:50:54,757 --> 00:50:57,224
They suck the fun
out of everything.

1213
00:50:57,226 --> 00:50:58,425
I'm failing every class.

1214
00:50:58,427 --> 00:51:00,327
I'm failing yoga.

1215
00:51:00,329 --> 00:51:03,463
How do you fail yoga?

1216
00:51:03,465 --> 00:51:05,565
You know what the worst part
of everything is?

1217
00:51:05,567 --> 00:51:09,136
This whole time we've been
having this conversation,

1218
00:51:09,138 --> 00:51:10,871
all I can think about
is how happy I am

1219
00:51:10,873 --> 00:51:13,473
to be in this gym,

1220
00:51:13,475 --> 00:51:16,276
because...

1221
00:51:16,278 --> 00:51:18,845
I fucking miss high school
so bad.

1222
00:51:20,582 --> 00:51:24,818
- And we will cue
the cw soundtrack...

1223
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,653
Right there.

1224
00:51:26,655 --> 00:51:27,487
- I mean, really?

1225
00:51:27,489 --> 00:51:28,688
We were having a nice moment.

1226
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:32,125
You got to be a bitch?

1227
00:51:32,127 --> 00:51:34,928
- No, honestly, though,

1228
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:36,496
I think that heather dumping you

1229
00:51:36,498 --> 00:51:41,168
is probably the best thing
that could have happened.

1230
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:42,170
Think about it.

1231
00:51:42,171 --> 00:51:43,703
She was giving you

1232
00:51:43,705 --> 00:51:45,906
a reason to resist
your new environment.

1233
00:51:45,908 --> 00:51:48,775
She was giving you an excuse
to hate it.

1234
00:51:48,777 --> 00:51:51,178
I think you're gonna like school
a whole hell of a lot better

1235
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,213
when you go back.

1236
00:51:55,384 --> 00:51:57,450
Okay, seriously, though,
we need to leave right now,

1237
00:51:57,452 --> 00:51:59,419
because I can't stand
this gym much longer.

1238
00:51:59,421 --> 00:52:01,221
I promised myself
the only way I would come back

1239
00:52:01,223 --> 00:52:02,823
is if I had telekinetic powers,

1240
00:52:02,825 --> 00:52:06,126
and that has not happened today,
so let's go.

1241
00:52:06,128 --> 00:52:08,328
- All right, but I'm driving.

1242
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:09,429
- What?
Why?

1243
00:52:09,431 --> 00:52:11,631
- I know cool places too.

1244
00:52:14,736 --> 00:52:17,270
- You're not high,
but you still can't catch.

1245
00:52:23,979 --> 00:52:25,278
- Dad's dead!

1246
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,746
Dad's dead.

1247
00:52:26,748 --> 00:52:28,815
Yo, my dad's dead, dad's dead.

1248
00:52:28,817 --> 00:52:31,651
- I can't believe you like
<i>what's eating gilbert grape?</i>

1249
00:52:31,653 --> 00:52:33,286
I thought I was the only one.

1250
00:52:33,288 --> 00:52:34,554
- Are you kidding me?

1251
00:52:34,556 --> 00:52:36,523
Okay, literally,
the only thing hotter

1252
00:52:36,525 --> 00:52:38,692
than leonardo dicaprio is, like,

1253
00:52:38,694 --> 00:52:42,462
a retarded leonardo dicaprio
wearing a fucking sexy diaper.

1254
00:52:42,464 --> 00:52:45,899
- That shit makes me so wet.

1255
00:52:47,302 --> 00:52:49,636
Okay, good.

1256
00:52:49,638 --> 00:52:55,275
Hey, do you want
to get retarded with me?

1257
00:52:55,277 --> 00:52:56,776
- What's that?

1258
00:52:56,778 --> 00:52:58,311
- It's ethyl.

1259
00:52:58,313 --> 00:53:01,548
It's like molly mixed
with bran muffin

1260
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:03,116
and prune juice or something.

1261
00:53:03,118 --> 00:53:04,117
I hear it's supposed to be...

1262
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:05,585
- Totes cray?

1263
00:53:05,587 --> 00:53:08,488
- Exactly.

1264
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:11,124
I thought that
you loved this stuff.

1265
00:53:11,126 --> 00:53:14,794
- What gave you that impression?

1266
00:53:14,796 --> 00:53:16,229
- I...

1267
00:53:16,231 --> 00:53:18,031
- You facebook stalked me.

1268
00:53:18,033 --> 00:53:19,332
- What?

1269
00:53:19,334 --> 00:53:21,067
- lacy posted that
stupid shit on my wall,

1270
00:53:21,069 --> 00:53:22,235
like, six hours ago,

1271
00:53:22,237 --> 00:53:23,470
about getting fucked up
on ethyl.

1272
00:53:23,472 --> 00:53:24,504
- What is facebook?

1273
00:53:24,506 --> 00:53:25,506
Is that a website?

1274
00:53:25,507 --> 00:53:26,940
- In fact, this whole night

1275
00:53:26,942 --> 00:53:29,376
has been a little too perfect,
hasn't it?

1276
00:53:29,378 --> 00:53:31,111
The restaurant, the dress,

1277
00:53:31,113 --> 00:53:33,346
our... our nonstop conversation.

1278
00:53:33,348 --> 00:53:35,015
- The conversation was all me.

1279
00:53:35,017 --> 00:53:36,082
- Really?

1280
00:53:36,084 --> 00:53:37,584
Because it's kind of weird

1281
00:53:37,586 --> 00:53:41,021
that all of your favorite things
are the same as mine.

1282
00:53:41,023 --> 00:53:43,723
Do you even like
<i>what's eating gilbert grape?</i>

1283
00:53:43,725 --> 00:53:44,958
- That was true.

1284
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,394
That fat mom being lit on fire
at the end?

1285
00:53:47,396 --> 00:53:48,662
Fucking beautiful!

1286
00:53:48,664 --> 00:53:50,463
Killed me.

1287
00:53:53,669 --> 00:53:55,168
Okay, fine.

1288
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:57,203
Fine, all right, so what?

1289
00:53:57,205 --> 00:53:58,405
What's the big deal?

1290
00:53:58,407 --> 00:54:00,006
I wanted to give you
a special time.

1291
00:54:00,008 --> 00:54:01,341
Is that a crime?
Am I in trouble?

1292
00:54:01,343 --> 00:54:02,709
Are you gonna yell at me?

1293
00:54:02,711 --> 00:54:04,644
I mean, I got one chance
to take you on a date,

1294
00:54:04,646 --> 00:54:06,112
and I just wanted to make sure...

1295
00:54:06,114 --> 00:54:08,982
- I said no.

1296
00:54:08,984 --> 00:54:13,086
I think it's really sweet
you tried to impress me.

1297
00:54:13,088 --> 00:54:14,088
- You do?

1298
00:54:14,089 --> 00:54:15,089
- Yeah.

1299
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:16,256
I mean, nobody cares

1300
00:54:16,258 --> 00:54:18,224
about what I think
or what I like.

1301
00:54:18,226 --> 00:54:19,559
- But I don't get it.

1302
00:54:19,561 --> 00:54:20,860
If you're not
into this ethyl stuff,

1303
00:54:20,862 --> 00:54:22,963
then why did you "like"
lacy's post?

1304
00:54:22,965 --> 00:54:25,966
- I don't like
half the stuff I "like."

1305
00:54:25,968 --> 00:54:28,969
It's just easier
to go along with everybody.

1306
00:54:33,342 --> 00:54:35,875
Thank you for dinner.

1307
00:54:35,877 --> 00:54:38,945
It was really retarded,

1308
00:54:38,947 --> 00:54:42,315
in a good way.

1309
00:54:42,317 --> 00:54:45,785
- Well, I've got one more stop.

1310
00:54:45,787 --> 00:54:47,954
And I promise this
is gonna be something

1311
00:54:47,956 --> 00:54:50,623
you'll actually "like."

1312
00:54:56,198 --> 00:54:58,264
I got three words:

1313
00:54:58,266 --> 00:55:01,501
Di-a-rrhea.

1314
00:55:01,503 --> 00:55:03,903
Am I right?

1315
00:55:03,905 --> 00:55:05,372
Slam dunk!

1316
00:55:07,075 --> 00:55:08,708
- All right, we're almost there.

1317
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:12,645
- Almost there, down the steps
to your deep, dark basement

1318
00:55:12,647 --> 00:55:14,914
where you'll chop my body up
into a million pieces,

1319
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:16,483
reveal that you're
a serial killer,

1320
00:55:16,485 --> 00:55:19,619
and wear my skin until you die?

1321
00:55:19,621 --> 00:55:22,422
- No, but I will do that
on our second date.

1322
00:55:22,424 --> 00:55:23,757
- Great.

1323
00:55:23,759 --> 00:55:25,425
- This is a little bit
more awesome.

1324
00:55:32,067 --> 00:55:33,299
Seriously?

1325
00:55:33,301 --> 00:55:34,701
- Yeah, cool, right?

1326
00:55:34,703 --> 00:55:37,070
- My god, how did you
even get in here?

1327
00:55:37,072 --> 00:55:38,538
- I have connections.

1328
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:41,841
Security guard was in my
community photography class.

1329
00:55:43,412 --> 00:55:46,980
I've never actually
even been here.

1330
00:55:46,982 --> 00:55:48,148
- Really?
- Yeah.

1331
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:51,151
- I used to come here,
like, every sunday.

1332
00:55:51,153 --> 00:55:52,352
- Really, you?

1333
00:55:52,354 --> 00:55:53,586
'Cause I never pegged you

1334
00:55:53,588 --> 00:55:55,455
for the prototypical
football fan.

1335
00:55:55,457 --> 00:55:56,556
- Really?
- Yeah.

1336
00:55:56,558 --> 00:55:57,690
- No, I love the football.

1337
00:55:57,692 --> 00:55:59,325
- You love<i> the</i> football?

1338
00:55:59,327 --> 00:56:01,528
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1339
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:03,463
Well, mr. football man,

1340
00:56:03,465 --> 00:56:07,600
how many points does one get
for a touchdown?

1341
00:56:07,602 --> 00:56:10,036
- Here, wait, let me think.

1342
00:56:10,038 --> 00:56:11,905
- Nice, good.

1343
00:56:11,907 --> 00:56:13,173
Yeah, awesome.

1344
00:56:13,175 --> 00:56:14,441
- Wait, almost got it.

1345
00:56:14,443 --> 00:56:16,209
- That's the one
I was looking for.

1346
00:56:16,211 --> 00:56:17,811
Perfect form.

1347
00:56:17,813 --> 00:56:19,212
Well done.

1348
00:56:19,214 --> 00:56:20,980
- All right, I don't know
anything about football.

1349
00:56:20,982 --> 00:56:22,015
But what I do know

1350
00:56:22,017 --> 00:56:23,850
is they got some
bomb-ass hotdogs here.

1351
00:56:23,852 --> 00:56:26,319
And the bathrooms are
way cleaner than you'd expect.

1352
00:56:26,321 --> 00:56:27,587
- Classy.
- Yeah.

1353
00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:28,888
- Classy stadium.

1354
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:30,256
- Yeah, we used to
come here every weekend.

1355
00:56:30,258 --> 00:56:31,558
My mom was a big fan,

1356
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:35,095
so this was usually
the family outing.

1357
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:44,604
- I've never heard you talk
about your mom before.

1358
00:56:44,606 --> 00:56:47,507
It was cancer, right?

1359
00:56:47,509 --> 00:56:49,342
- No, actually,
she was a sagittarius.

1360
00:56:49,344 --> 00:56:51,077
What's your mom?

1361
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:58,451
Yeah, she passed away
a few years ago.

1362
00:56:58,453 --> 00:56:59,919
Can we actually skip this whole

1363
00:56:59,921 --> 00:57:01,621
"how did it feel
when she died?" Thing?

1364
00:57:01,623 --> 00:57:03,189
I have done that with
so many guidance counselors.

1365
00:57:03,191 --> 00:57:04,124
I am good.

1366
00:57:04,126 --> 00:57:05,592
- Yeah, no, I mean,

1367
00:57:05,594 --> 00:57:07,093
I was already getting bored,

1368
00:57:07,095 --> 00:57:09,295
so I'm really glad
that we're moving on.

1369
00:57:09,297 --> 00:57:10,430
Thank you so much.

1370
00:57:10,432 --> 00:57:13,299
- Awesome.

1371
00:57:13,301 --> 00:57:15,935
- So, um...

1372
00:57:15,937 --> 00:57:19,472
What would you prefer
to talk about?

1373
00:57:19,474 --> 00:57:21,975
- Actually,
you know the other night

1374
00:57:21,977 --> 00:57:24,277
when you said it was "just sex"?

1375
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:29,249
- Was that, like "just sex"
one time,

1376
00:57:29,251 --> 00:57:33,353
or could we just have "just sex"

1377
00:57:33,355 --> 00:57:35,922
just again?

1378
00:57:35,924 --> 00:57:38,124
- From the dead mom to sex.

1379
00:57:38,126 --> 00:57:42,495
That is a very impressively
smooth segue there, romeo.

1380
00:57:42,497 --> 00:57:44,931
- I'd say it's a touchdown.

1381
00:57:44,933 --> 00:57:46,032
- Yeah, awesome.

1382
00:57:46,034 --> 00:57:47,600
It's not real without the dance.

1383
00:57:47,602 --> 00:57:48,902
Okay, there it is.

1384
00:57:48,904 --> 00:57:52,572
There you go, yeah, nice.

1385
00:57:52,574 --> 00:57:54,707
- No, seriously, though,

1386
00:57:54,709 --> 00:57:57,043
you didn't answer the question.

1387
00:58:05,253 --> 00:58:06,253
- Shit!

1388
00:58:06,254 --> 00:58:07,620
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1389
00:58:07,622 --> 00:58:09,255
No, I thought it was gonna be,
like, romantic.

1390
00:58:09,257 --> 00:58:10,290
My god, are you okay?

1391
00:58:10,292 --> 00:58:11,292
- It's okay, it's okay.

1392
00:58:11,293 --> 00:58:12,293
- You okay?

1393
00:58:12,294 --> 00:58:13,294
- I think I taste blood.

1394
00:58:13,295 --> 00:58:14,295
- Shit.

1395
00:58:14,296 --> 00:58:15,495
- I think I taste blood.

1396
00:58:20,435 --> 00:58:24,103
- All right, we're here.

1397
00:58:24,105 --> 00:58:26,172
- So you brought me to a place

1398
00:58:26,174 --> 00:58:29,909
I've been to
a billion times before?

1399
00:58:29,911 --> 00:58:31,644
- Hit it.

1400
00:58:35,417 --> 00:58:39,485
<i>- ♪ Whatever it takes ♪</i>

1401
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:41,254
<i>♪ you know I can
make it through ♪</i>

1402
00:58:41,256 --> 00:58:43,556
-<i> degrassi?</i>

1403
00:58:43,558 --> 00:58:46,359
That was my favorite show
growing up.

1404
00:58:46,361 --> 00:58:47,961
- I know.

1405
00:58:47,963 --> 00:58:50,663
You performed the theme song
at the middle school talent show

1406
00:58:50,665 --> 00:58:52,098
three years in a row.

1407
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:55,235
- My favorite episode
is when jimmy gets shot.

1408
00:58:55,237 --> 00:58:58,838
No, where emma gets gonorrhea
in her throat.

1409
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,872
No!

1410
00:58:59,874 --> 00:59:02,475
When spinner
gets ballsack cancer.

1411
00:59:02,477 --> 00:59:04,310
My god, so sad.

1412
00:59:04,312 --> 00:59:07,113
I almost cried.

1413
00:59:07,115 --> 00:59:10,283
- jesus, that show
is, like, really fucked up.

1414
00:59:10,285 --> 00:59:11,584
- I know.

1415
00:59:11,586 --> 00:59:15,154
It goes there.

1416
00:59:17,959 --> 00:59:19,726
- All right, and we're
gonna slow it down

1417
00:59:19,728 --> 00:59:22,862
with the after-the-credits
version.

1418
00:59:24,866 --> 00:59:27,834
- We have to dance.

1419
00:59:27,836 --> 00:59:29,602
- I don't know how to dance.

1420
00:59:29,604 --> 00:59:31,971
- Yes, you do know how to dance.

1421
00:59:31,973 --> 00:59:33,406
Come on.

1422
00:59:33,408 --> 00:59:34,408
Put your hands here.

1423
00:59:34,409 --> 00:59:35,575
- Okay.

1424
00:59:35,577 --> 00:59:37,443
- And then I put my hands
up here.

1425
00:59:37,445 --> 00:59:39,279
And now we just sway.

1426
00:59:39,281 --> 00:59:40,281
- Sway.

1427
00:59:40,282 --> 00:59:41,881
- Sway, sway.

1428
00:59:41,883 --> 00:59:42,715
- Okay.

1429
00:59:42,717 --> 00:59:44,317
- Move your hips.

1430
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:45,852
- But I don't want
to step on your feet.

1431
00:59:45,854 --> 00:59:47,620
- You're not gonna step
on my feet.

1432
00:59:47,622 --> 00:59:48,622
Chillax.

1433
00:59:48,623 --> 00:59:49,789
- But it could happen.

1434
00:59:49,791 --> 00:59:51,791
- That's good, joel-ski.

1435
00:59:51,793 --> 00:59:52,793
- You're lying.

1436
00:59:52,794 --> 00:59:53,794
I know you're lying.

1437
00:59:53,795 --> 00:59:55,728
- I'm not lying.

1438
01:00:21,423 --> 01:00:22,955
- My god.

1439
01:00:22,957 --> 01:00:24,290
This is just like the episode
where clare left eli

1440
01:00:24,292 --> 01:00:26,893
because she found out
he was bipolar.

1441
01:00:53,555 --> 01:00:55,154
- What's wrong?

1442
01:00:55,156 --> 01:00:57,457
- Nothing.

1443
01:00:57,459 --> 01:00:58,591
- You nervous?

1444
01:00:58,593 --> 01:01:00,093
- No.

1445
01:01:00,095 --> 01:01:01,594
- I mean, we've kind of
already done this before.

1446
01:01:01,596 --> 01:01:02,695
- Yeah, it's just this time

1447
01:01:02,697 --> 01:01:05,431
I'm not covered in puke.

1448
01:01:11,272 --> 01:01:13,439
- You're beautiful,
you know that?

1449
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:17,377
You always were.

1450
01:01:35,597 --> 01:01:37,430
- Shit.

1451
01:01:41,236 --> 01:01:43,870
My god.

1452
01:01:43,872 --> 01:01:47,106
Shit, is it 6:00 already?

1453
01:01:47,108 --> 01:01:48,708
I promised I would help set up

1454
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:51,477
for my sister's
engagement party.

1455
01:01:52,881 --> 01:01:54,547
Hey, does this shirt say, like,

1456
01:01:54,549 --> 01:01:57,250
"I don't want to be here,
and I don't give a fuck"?

1457
01:01:57,252 --> 01:01:58,050
- Yeah.

1458
01:01:58,052 --> 01:02:01,020
- Awesome, perfect.

1459
01:02:01,022 --> 01:02:03,856
You can come if you want to.

1460
01:02:03,858 --> 01:02:05,057
- Really?

1461
01:02:05,059 --> 01:02:06,726
All right,
I love engagement parties.

1462
01:02:06,728 --> 01:02:11,964
- All right, let's not make me
regret fucking you.

1463
01:02:11,966 --> 01:02:14,667
- Hey, I was thinking about it.

1464
01:02:14,669 --> 01:02:15,902
Me and you should go
on a road trip.

1465
01:02:15,904 --> 01:02:17,937
- What, like, over christmas?

1466
01:02:17,939 --> 01:02:19,705
- No, like, this week.

1467
01:02:19,707 --> 01:02:22,108
- I have classes on monday.

1468
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:24,444
- Well, then you can
just skip them.

1469
01:02:24,446 --> 01:02:27,413
- I can't, and I don't want to.

1470
01:02:27,415 --> 01:02:31,451
- Come on, we can go somewhere
awesome, you know, like...

1471
01:02:31,453 --> 01:02:33,019
kentucky.

1472
01:02:33,021 --> 01:02:35,655
You know, you're allowed
to have sex with your dog there.

1473
01:02:35,657 --> 01:02:37,990
- That sounds fantastic,

1474
01:02:37,992 --> 01:02:40,993
but didn't you just tell me

1475
01:02:40,995 --> 01:02:44,397
that you were, like,
flunking out of school?

1476
01:02:44,399 --> 01:02:47,700
- I don't really want
to go back anyways.

1477
01:02:47,702 --> 01:02:50,903
- What are you talking about?

1478
01:02:50,905 --> 01:02:53,473
- I just want to stay here,
you know?

1479
01:02:53,475 --> 01:02:55,107
Why am I gonna go back?

1480
01:02:55,109 --> 01:02:57,777
I mean, we've got all this
random shit in your trunk

1481
01:02:57,779 --> 01:02:59,212
that we can play with.

1482
01:02:59,214 --> 01:03:02,114
We could have sex
in parking lots every night.

1483
01:03:02,116 --> 01:03:04,517
- Okay, yeah,
I really can't tell

1484
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:07,420
if you're being serious
or not right now.

1485
01:03:07,422 --> 01:03:09,188
- Dead.

1486
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:10,523
- No.

1487
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:12,925
- Come on, you already forget
about the fuck it list?

1488
01:03:12,927 --> 01:03:14,193
Let go a little.

1489
01:03:14,195 --> 01:03:16,195
- Wow, you completely
misinterpreted

1490
01:03:16,197 --> 01:03:18,197
the entire purpose
of that exercise.

1491
01:03:18,199 --> 01:03:20,967
- All I'm saying is that I want
to hang out with you more.

1492
01:03:20,969 --> 01:03:23,336
So why is that so bad?

1493
01:03:23,338 --> 01:03:26,939
- You were supposed to take
lessons from the list

1494
01:03:26,941 --> 01:03:29,475
and apply them to
your new life in new york.

1495
01:03:29,477 --> 01:03:31,811
You're supposed
to kick ass in school

1496
01:03:31,813 --> 01:03:33,246
and meet new people

1497
01:03:33,248 --> 01:03:34,981
and have all
these great experiences.

1498
01:03:34,983 --> 01:03:36,183
You're not supposed to retreat

1499
01:03:36,184 --> 01:03:38,751
back to whatever
is easy for you.

1500
01:03:38,753 --> 01:03:40,086
- Come on.

1501
01:03:40,088 --> 01:03:42,288
You weren't that easy.

1502
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:44,023
- Really, dude?

1503
01:03:46,594 --> 01:03:47,627
- Come on, I was kidding.

1504
01:03:47,629 --> 01:03:48,661
- No, it's...

1505
01:03:48,663 --> 01:03:49,663
You know what, it's fine.

1506
01:03:49,664 --> 01:03:51,731
It's fine.

1507
01:03:51,733 --> 01:03:52,932
- Can we not end on a fight?

1508
01:03:52,934 --> 01:03:54,000
- We're not having a fight.

1509
01:03:54,002 --> 01:03:55,535
Just, like, chill out.

1510
01:03:55,537 --> 01:03:56,969
I just have to get back,

1511
01:03:56,971 --> 01:03:58,471
so just tell me
how to get to your house.

1512
01:03:58,473 --> 01:03:59,739
- Why?

1513
01:03:59,741 --> 01:04:02,275
I thought we were going
to your house for the party.

1514
01:04:02,277 --> 01:04:07,613
- I... yeah, I got to check
and make sure that's cool.

1515
01:04:07,615 --> 01:04:10,449
- You can just take route 28.

1516
01:04:10,451 --> 01:04:12,151
- Okay.

1517
01:04:18,059 --> 01:04:20,593
- Well,
that's the last one, boss.

1518
01:04:20,595 --> 01:04:22,595
- That's it?

1519
01:04:22,597 --> 01:04:24,330
Well, I suppose we should go

1520
01:04:24,332 --> 01:04:26,766
before crackheads
and hookers move in.

1521
01:04:31,306 --> 01:04:32,738
- Too late.

1522
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:34,640
- Hey, you made it.

1523
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:53,526
- So...

1524
01:04:53,528 --> 01:04:54,627
How was your night?

1525
01:04:54,629 --> 01:04:56,529
Did you kiss any dudes

1526
01:04:56,531 --> 01:04:59,832
and then run away crying
and leaving them stranded

1527
01:04:59,834 --> 01:05:02,335
with a shitty two-person band

1528
01:05:02,337 --> 01:05:05,705
to talk about that one time
they almost got signed?

1529
01:05:05,707 --> 01:05:07,406
- joel, I like you.

1530
01:05:08,543 --> 01:05:09,642
Could have fooled me.

1531
01:05:09,644 --> 01:05:10,644
- As a friend.

1532
01:05:10,645 --> 01:05:12,111
- Perfect.

1533
01:05:12,113 --> 01:05:14,080
- I'm sorry I don't
like you more than that.

1534
01:05:14,082 --> 01:05:15,548
I wish I did.

1535
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:17,016
Unfortunately for me,

1536
01:05:17,018 --> 01:05:19,151
I'm attracted to muscular,

1537
01:05:19,153 --> 01:05:22,288
more conventionally
attractive men.

1538
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:23,589
- That's not nice.

1539
01:05:23,591 --> 01:05:24,790
Why are you saying...

1540
01:05:24,792 --> 01:05:26,292
Is this supposed to be
making me feel better?

1541
01:05:26,294 --> 01:05:27,627
- I almost slept with you
last night.

1542
01:05:27,629 --> 01:05:30,296
- Again, not making me
feel better.

1543
01:05:30,298 --> 01:05:33,032
- joel, I wanted you
to be my friend.

1544
01:05:33,034 --> 01:05:34,300
I'm not like you.

1545
01:05:34,302 --> 01:05:36,502
I don't have anyone to talk to.

1546
01:05:36,504 --> 01:05:37,903
- What?
What are you talking about?

1547
01:05:37,905 --> 01:05:39,839
You're, like, you.

1548
01:05:39,841 --> 01:05:41,340
You're super popular.

1549
01:05:41,342 --> 01:05:43,776
- Yeah, with people
I'm never going to talk to

1550
01:05:43,778 --> 01:05:45,444
once I graduate.

1551
01:05:45,446 --> 01:05:49,115
Mandy, stacy, and lacy
are totes retar.

1552
01:05:49,117 --> 01:05:51,984
My brother's
a self-absorbed asshole.

1553
01:05:51,986 --> 01:05:55,554
Even my dad prefers
talking to you over me.

1554
01:05:55,556 --> 01:05:57,623
I feel comfortable
around you, joel.

1555
01:05:57,625 --> 01:05:59,925
You listen to me,
and for some reason,

1556
01:05:59,927 --> 01:06:02,261
you like me for who I am.

1557
01:06:02,263 --> 01:06:04,030
I didn't want
to throw that all away

1558
01:06:04,032 --> 01:06:06,632
by having meaningless sex.

1559
01:06:08,169 --> 01:06:10,269
Am I making sense?

1560
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:14,006
Thank you.

1561
01:06:14,008 --> 01:06:15,241
I felt so bad.

1562
01:06:15,243 --> 01:06:17,610
I'm sorry I abandoned you.

1563
01:06:17,612 --> 01:06:18,744
- It's okay.

1564
01:06:18,746 --> 01:06:20,179
To be fair,
you warned me ahead of time

1565
01:06:20,181 --> 01:06:22,248
that you weren't interested.

1566
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:24,550
- Well, you were pretty hard
to discourage.

1567
01:06:24,552 --> 01:06:25,651
- I know.

1568
01:06:25,653 --> 01:06:27,119
I guess I just wanted
my first time

1569
01:06:27,121 --> 01:06:29,622
to be with someone special.

1570
01:06:29,624 --> 01:06:30,624
- First time?

1571
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:31,857
- No.

1572
01:06:31,859 --> 01:06:33,359
I mean my 17th time.

1573
01:06:33,361 --> 01:06:36,262
I wanted my 17th time
to be with someone special,

1574
01:06:36,264 --> 01:06:38,698
because that's...
That's my lucky number.

1575
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:40,633
That, and 69,

1576
01:06:40,635 --> 01:06:43,536
because of... Oral sex.

1577
01:06:43,538 --> 01:06:46,072
- That's not how you do it.

1578
01:06:47,108 --> 01:06:48,974
Please don't tell anyone.

1579
01:06:48,976 --> 01:06:50,643
- What about your tumblr?

1580
01:06:50,645 --> 01:06:52,311
- I made that up.

1581
01:06:52,313 --> 01:06:55,581
Only boobs I've ever seen
are my mom's.

1582
01:06:56,851 --> 01:06:58,884
Joel!

1583
01:06:58,886 --> 01:07:00,052
I'm sorry.

1584
01:07:00,054 --> 01:07:01,087
I'm sorry; That's not funny.

1585
01:07:01,089 --> 01:07:02,154
- No, it is.

1586
01:07:02,156 --> 01:07:03,422
My mom's titties are hilarious.

1587
01:07:06,894 --> 01:07:10,062
Well, lucky for you,
we're friends now.

1588
01:07:10,064 --> 01:07:12,098
- Should we get bracelets?

1589
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:15,434
- I was thinking
I'd get you laid.

1590
01:07:15,436 --> 01:07:17,436
Friends don't let friends
stay virgins,

1591
01:07:17,438 --> 01:07:18,971
and I happen to know a trio

1592
01:07:18,973 --> 01:07:23,709
of overly promiscuous,
easily impressionable ladies.

1593
01:07:23,711 --> 01:07:25,678
- So you're just going
to pimp them out?

1594
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,113
Really?

1595
01:07:27,115 --> 01:07:29,181
- Yes.

1596
01:07:29,183 --> 01:07:30,683
- Okay, I can live with that.

1597
01:07:30,685 --> 01:07:31,951
- joel-ski.

1598
01:07:31,953 --> 01:07:33,152
- janie.

1599
01:07:34,455 --> 01:07:35,821
- Sorry.

1600
01:07:35,823 --> 01:07:38,157
I didn't... okay.

1601
01:07:43,765 --> 01:07:47,500
- At least turn off
your send receipt feature.

1602
01:07:47,502 --> 01:07:50,970
I mean, come on!

1603
01:07:50,972 --> 01:07:52,538
- Hey, aren't you supposed

1604
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:56,175
to be at shareef's
crazy rager tonight?

1605
01:07:56,177 --> 01:07:57,576
Yeah, I know shit.

1606
01:07:57,578 --> 01:08:01,013
- Nah, I'm not in the mood.

1607
01:08:01,015 --> 01:08:02,114
- Come on.

1608
01:08:02,116 --> 01:08:03,249
Go on out and have some fun.

1609
01:08:03,251 --> 01:08:04,617
Just don't do maria.

1610
01:08:04,619 --> 01:08:05,651
- Who?

1611
01:08:05,653 --> 01:08:06,786
- maria.

1612
01:08:06,788 --> 01:08:08,020
It's molly.

1613
01:08:08,022 --> 01:08:09,054
Little bit of chili,

1614
01:08:09,056 --> 01:08:10,589
little bit of cayenne pepper.

1615
01:08:10,591 --> 01:08:12,191
<i>Muy caliente.</i>

1616
01:08:12,193 --> 01:08:14,894
I told you I know shit.

1617
01:08:16,731 --> 01:08:20,733
All: Chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug, chug, chug!

1618
01:08:21,969 --> 01:08:23,135
Tori the whorie?

1619
01:08:23,137 --> 01:08:24,470
- don't call her that.

1620
01:08:24,472 --> 01:08:28,107
- I cannot believe
you had sex with her.

1621
01:08:28,109 --> 01:08:30,109
- What the fuck!

1622
01:08:30,111 --> 01:08:31,544
- Ooh.

1623
01:08:31,546 --> 01:08:32,578
- Her?

1624
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:33,979
You're telling me
that you had sex

with that butter-everything?

1627
01:08:39,453 --> 01:08:40,653
What, are you crazy?

1628
01:08:40,655 --> 01:08:41,687

1629
01:08:41,689 --> 01:08:44,723
Mental illness
is nothing to laugh at.

1630
01:08:44,725 --> 01:08:46,425
It's personal!

1631
01:08:49,397 --> 01:08:51,797

1632
01:08:53,968 --> 01:08:55,634

1633
01:08:55,636 --> 01:08:57,937
- Yeah, you better run, bitch!

1634
01:08:57,939 --> 01:08:59,839
- I didn't have sex with her.

1635
01:08:59,841 --> 01:09:01,740
- You didn't?

1636
01:09:01,742 --> 01:09:05,845
Scotty, I missed you so much.

1637
01:09:05,847 --> 01:09:07,680
For reals, boo.

01:09:46,988 --> 01:09:48,687
Whoo.

1648
01:09:48,689 --> 01:09:52,124

janie's gonna hook it up?

1649
01:09:52,126 --> 01:09:53,192

1650
01:09:53,194 --> 01:09:54,994

He just wanted to let me know.

- So, what, you're just
gonna ignore him?

You actually like him.

- All right, bye, bitch.

1670
01:10:40,241 --> 01:10:42,474

01:10:42,476 --> 01:10:45,911
- I thought you were
setting up a trap to kill me.

1672
01:10:45,913 --> 01:10:49,281
- Wow, I actually never
thought about doing that.

1673
01:10:49,283 --> 01:10:51,650
Weird.

1674
01:10:53,821 --> 01:10:57,389
So, why did you leave
your engagement party?

1675
01:10:57,391 --> 01:10:58,958
Did everyone get
explosive diarrhea

and have to go home?

1677
01:11:00,094 --> 01:11:01,927
- No, why would that happen?

1678
01:11:01,929 --> 01:11:03,095
- I don't know.

1679
01:11:03,097 --> 01:11:04,964
I mean, big punchbowl,
no one guarding it.

Things happen.

1681
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:07,232
- No, I just needed a break.

1682
01:11:07,234 --> 01:11:08,634
I mean, I love the family,

1683
01:11:08,636 --> 01:11:10,636
but sometimes
they drive me crazy.

1684
01:11:10,638 --> 01:11:11,971
You know what I mean?

1685
01:11:11,973 --> 01:11:13,439
- Yes.

1686
01:11:13,441 --> 01:11:16,976
My god, I related to
a solid half of that statement.

1687

- Wait, how do you even
know about that?

1689
01:11:21,983 --> 01:11:23,615
- Sixth sense.

You know, never mind.

Too easy.

1693
01:11:28,956 --> 01:11:30,789
- I mean, you know
that scott likes you.

1694
01:11:30,791 --> 01:11:32,124
- Well, you know,
that's too bad,

1695
01:11:32,126 --> 01:11:34,660
because I don't like him.

1696
01:11:36,464 --> 01:11:38,130
- Yes, you are full of shit.

1697
01:11:38,132 --> 01:11:40,366
- Okay, fine, I like him.

1698
01:11:40,368 --> 01:11:41,368
But you know what?

1699
01:11:41,369 --> 01:11:42,568
It's complicated.

1700
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:43,869
He's complicated.

1701
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,170
Actually, you know what,
he's simple.

1702
01:11:45,172 --> 01:11:46,338
He's far too simple,

1703
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:48,974
and so scared of everything.

1704
01:11:48,976 --> 01:11:51,844
I mean, I was so close
to fixing him.

1705
01:11:51,846 --> 01:11:54,947
He was so fucking close
to being...

1706
01:11:54,949 --> 01:11:55,949
- Just like you.

1707

- With a penis!

1708
01:11:57,184 --> 01:11:58,751
- He's not your project, tori.

1709
01:11:58,753 --> 01:12:00,519
You can't force him
to be something he isn't.

1710
01:12:00,521 --> 01:12:03,622
You just have to accept him
for who he is.

1711
01:12:03,624 --> 01:12:06,492
My god, how do you accept gil?

1712
01:12:06,494 --> 01:12:07,559
- I drink a lot.

1713
01:12:07,561 --> 01:12:09,128
I'm actually not even blind.

1714
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:11,497
I'm just in a constant state
of blackout drunkness.

1715
01:12:13,901 --> 01:12:19,204
God, we have far more in common
that I thought.

1716
01:12:19,206 --> 01:12:21,840
- I always knew you were gonna
grow up to be beautiful, tori,

1717
01:12:21,842 --> 01:12:25,944
and that you were gonna have to
beat the boys away with a stick.

1718
01:12:25,946 --> 01:12:28,947
Just don't beat them all away.

1719
01:12:35,289 --> 01:12:36,522

mother-.

- All right,
my little sweethearts,

1790
01:16:01,395 --> 01:16:03,195
name of the game is strip cup.

1791
01:16:03,197 --> 01:16:06,498
Now, for every miss,
you have to...

1792
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:09,167
Take off an article of clothing.

1793
01:16:09,169 --> 01:16:10,435
- And for every make,

1794
01:16:10,437 --> 01:16:13,505
we have to take off
an article of clothing too.

1795

Yes.

Come on.

Okay, tori's really pissed
at me, and I need your help.

1805
01:16:34,194 --> 01:16:35,594

1808

I thought I was clear
the first time.

1809

1810

I just need your help.

I'd probably say
tori's not talking to you

1813
01:16:48,475 --> 01:16:51,176

thinking about yourself.

The depth of your selfishness

You always seem so happy.

01:17:08,896 --> 01:17:11,129
- Well, that's kind of
the point.

1825
01:17:11,131 --> 01:17:12,898
You're only worrying
about yourself.

1826
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:14,466
You're not aware
of your surroundings,

1827
01:17:14,468 --> 01:17:18,136
let alone your only sister.

1828
