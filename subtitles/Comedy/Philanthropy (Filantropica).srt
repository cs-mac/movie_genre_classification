1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,473
And whisky for me.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,714
Make it a double.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,477
Have you tried this Afghan?
It's great with whisky.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,357
How's being a writer, fun?

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,877
It's cool if you're a pro.
But you have to pay to play.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,917
Some guys claim

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,998
they can write in a cold-water flat,

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,033
with their folks around
and an empty fridge: Bullshit!

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,113
Only suckers buy that.

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,669
You need a nice environment.

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,711
A house in the mountains...

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,355
A nice bottle of whisky...
Some cool music...

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,756
Music is what you put down on paper.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,670
But writing on music
turns you into a lyricist.

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,752
Without music,
I couldn't even sign my name.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,275
You can't blame music for that.

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,791
What about other stuff?
You need music for it too?

18
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,871
Listen to the macho man!

19
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,390
Wow, it's the A list!

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,591
Shit! Here comes the Joker...

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,593
The party's over...
How did he find us?

22
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,438
Okay, you morons.

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,678
I had to make a zillion calls

24
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,916
to find out where the action was.

25
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,557
If I ever find the big mouth...

26
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,514
Too late. We were about to go.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,069
No kidding.
Man, I'm in the mood tonight!

28
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,593
You with this grandpa?

29
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,393
Does it bother you?

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,955
No, I'm waiting my turn.
For what?

31
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,516
To take our friendship
to a higher plane.

32
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,232
Hi, man.

33
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,913
Don't go sulky.
I like people who can take a joke.

34
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,869
He'll have you
laughing your brains out.

35
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,110
Didn't you know? He's a scream!

36
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,955
But she doesn't appreciate that.
He hangs out with sorry guys.

37
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,794
Let me show you a trick.

38
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,038
How do millionaires smoke?

39
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,317
Like me!

40
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,679
No. Give me the pack.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,274
And the lighter.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,639
I'd like to know
how much you charge.

43
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,476
For what?
To get lost.

44
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,271
What bribe would make you
go to bed early?

45
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,270
About what time?
About now.

46
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,236
My price is one million.
Per night.

47
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,992
Here's two million.

48
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,150
I'm paying in advance
for the next time.

49
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,873
I love doing business
with responsible people.

50
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,509
That's a good one!
The old man's cool!

51
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,875
You have a good night now.
I get it, you're a smart dude...

52
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,310
Now say good bye to everybody,

53
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,476
and off you go, home to bed.

54
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,795
Take your money back.

55
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,951
Lady Di! I'm joking
and your friend's taking it too far.

56
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,799
What joke, you took the money?
Get going!

57
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,237
Mom's waiting for you.
Let him stay...

58
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,794
No!

59
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,151
We don't want to go to bed, do we?

60
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,878
Baby making a scene?

61
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,431
No, he's just leaving.
I'm not going anywhere!

62
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,913
You all suck!

63
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,030
Come on, let's have some fun.

64
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,715
I have to ask you to leave.
Why?

65
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,757
You're disturbing a customer.

66
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,475
Who is he to lay down the law?

67
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,715
If you don't know,
brush up on your reading.

68
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,392
Do I have to show you to your car?

69
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,675
You'll crawl on your knees
to have me back!

70
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,635
I piss on your crummy club!

71
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,151
You pick on me?

72
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,194
I'll have the taxman
on your ass!

73
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,557
I'll close you down!

74
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,513
You'll be on fucking welfare,
you shitheads!

75
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,395
Not here.

76
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,988
There are too many old ladies
spying on us.

77
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,959
Come with me.

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,991
You can't come up,
my folks are home.

79
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,753
Otherwise I could?
What do you think?

80
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,276
Would your brother Robert...

81
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,671
be upset if he knew
we were going out?

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,638
Why would he be?

83
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,195
He's a bit impulsive.
He might not understand.

84
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,197
Do I ask him about his dates?

85
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,992
That's enough. You have to go.

86
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,960
Don't forget me till next Saturday.

87
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,033
You see her only on Saturdays?

88
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,151
She can't go out during the week.

89
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,993
Models are obsessed
with beauty sleep.

90
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,789
It's for the best. I couldn't handle
seeing her more often.

91
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,313
Money wise or...

92
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,549
I'm a beggar on weekdays
and a prince at weekends.

93
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,832
Your bill, Sir.
Thank you.

94
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,873
Irresistible,
but much too expensive.

95
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,634
The bill?
No, I'm talking about Diana.

96
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,430
Imagine the cost
of a whole week with her.

97
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,990
Based on last Saturday's expenses...

98
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,159
And the bill?

99
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,719
What is this?

100
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,593
I hope it's a mistake!

101
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,634
Robert!

102
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,678
Come here a second.

103
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,797
If they score, I'll kill you!

104
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,908
What?

105
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,799
Just a minute...
I have to catch my breath.

106
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,634
How are things at home?

107
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,715
Fine.

108
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,636
Your sister, how is she?

109
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,195
She's okay.

110
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,113
Speaking of your sister...

111
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,957
I know a girl about her age

112
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,191
and I'd like to give her a present.

113
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,917
I thought I'd ask your advice.

114
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,640
A girl like Diana, for example,
what would she like?

115
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,075
I got it!
You want to get laid!

116
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,998
No, it's just...

117
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,834
If you have a chick you want to bang,

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,672
forget the presents!

119
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,555
Take her home,
give her some whisky and bang her.

120
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,190
Jesus,
do I have to teach you everything?

121
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,433
Dismissed.

122
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,550
If you break them,
you're paying them, okay?

123
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,310
Look.
Phone and power bills.

124
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,399
Show the young lady

125
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,637
what we have to pay
out of two lousy pensions.

126
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,472
One more thing...

127
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,949
I've read it. It's poor.

128
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,234
My place is out of the question.
Hotels are vulgar.

129
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,949
Her place, I get Robert.
Where can we go?

130
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,798
No friends?

131
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,037
I've got acquaintances.
They're all married.

132
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,236
And they all live
way below my standards.

133
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,870
Do you mind changing the subject?

134
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,474
Why?

135
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,275
You can't spend the evening
talking about yourself.

136
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,640
It's no fun for your wife,
whoever she may be,

137
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,350
to listen to you
blabbering about some disco queen.

138
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,716
Especially on an anniversary.

139
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,108
What anniversary?

140
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,478
10 years of marriage.

141
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,949
Are you nuts?

142
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,838
We do that every night.

143
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,673
Maybe tonight it's special.

144
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,309
What do you mean?

145
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,675
Maybe I want it to be special.

146
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,473
But...
Maybe it's our 10 day anniversary.

147
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,428
Of working together...

148
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,953
Of me being your wife.

149
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,394
At least
that's what these people think.

150
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,356
So spare me your cheap flings.

151
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,918
Don Pepe can kiss my ass!

152
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,398
Where are you going?
I've got to pee.

153
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,234
You know...

154
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,911
when you bring a girl to your place,

155
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,711
sometimes she asks
where the bathroom is.

156
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,556
So?
So it's good to know where it is.

157
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,837
To be able to find a clean towel,
turn the stereo on...

158
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,473
To have some personal things
here and there...

159
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,114
That's easy.

160
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,079
But I don't have a "here and there"
to take her to.

161
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,394
Talk to Pepe.
He's an understanding guy.

162
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,155
What?
Must I finance your sexcapades?

163
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,839
Open your eyes!

164
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,712
That's the city you live in.

165
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,795
The view is perfect,
beats the top of the Hilton.

166
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,796
See the nobodies passing by?

167
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,471
Millions of nobodies.

168
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,835
When I first saw
your nobody writer face, I thought:

169
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,913
Miruna, coffee!

170
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,791
I thought: This nobody
wants to be somebody.

171
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,556
This guy wants to learn the trade.

172
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,198
Where is that coffee?

173
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,029
There are 3 basic trades
in the world:

174
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,590
Wealth, poverty and sex.

175
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,992
Either of them pays the rent.

176
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,671
But on love and writing
you starve, fool!

177
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,913
You die for free.

178
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,470
The residence is vacant, isn't it?

179
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,153
How narrow minded!

180
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:28,751
I give him all these profits,
trying to open his eyes to the future.

181
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,714
While he is busy singing serenades!

182
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,350
It's been available since yesterday.

183
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,790
What?
The residence on Autumn Street.

184
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,110
So what?
So it's available.

185
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,679
Is this a conspiracy?

186
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,274
Are you ganging up on me?
When does he need it?

187
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,515
Saturday.
It's early yet.

188
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,069
First I want results.
Back to work!

189
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,795
Don't talk like that to a client!

190
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,393
Do I have to pay for them?

191
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,319
How much they owe?
I'll put down half.

192
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,115
Is it him?

193
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,437
It is!
Who?

194
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,432
That guy who can't pay the bill.

195
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,710
Weird, suddenly he's broke!

196
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,395
And married, too...

197
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,349
Thank you...

198
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,632
Here...
Smoke it like a millionaire.

199
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,875
Don't mock the needy.
It's not nice.

200
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,838
Aren't you ashamed?

201
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,712
Beat it!

202
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,077
Mind your own business!

203
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,948
You live here?

204
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,953
Sing a song for the World Bank,

205
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,153
All the orphans wait in rank

206
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,440
Sing a song for PHARE Fund...

207
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,598
Here.
Thank you, Sir.

208
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,075
Isn't that too much?
I feel sorry for them.

209
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,991
So...
How come it didn't work out?

210
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,674
I spent the day
exploring the house,

211
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,634
setting everything up,

212
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,310
rummaging everywhere.
I filled up the fridge.

213
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,352
One tiny detail slipped my mind.

214
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,479
Let's have some light...

215
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,153
One second
and we'll have some light...

216
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,998
You don't really want
to turn on the lights, do you?

217
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,435
Bad boy!
One second.

218
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,509
Want a drink?

219
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,471
You know what
I like most about you?

220
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,229
No.

221
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,391
You don't show off your money.

222
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,151
Most of the men I ve dated

223
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,437
like to... brag a bit.

224
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,517
They know that a girl
who has looks

225
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,350
can't shop in any cheap store.

226
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,710
I like it when a man is able
to give me a few luxuries,

227
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,118
but he should do it like you,
in style.

228
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,078
Don't you agree?

229
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,718
I do.

230
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,352
Want to go upstairs?

231
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,150
We have music up there, too.

232
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,389
Don't answer.

233
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,198
This is the Filantropica Residence.

234
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,709
Leave your message after the beep.

235
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,639
Ungureanu speaking.

236
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,120
I'd like to rent the house for
Thursday the 13th and Friday the 14th.

237
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,592
I hope the price is still the same.
Call me with confirmation

238
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,479
on 4235617.

239
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,119
It was a mistake!

240
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,590
Don't be silly! Somebody dialed
the wrong number.

241
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,920
Guess who called me yesterday?
The Joker.

242
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,029
He saw you haggling
over the bill in a restaurant.

243
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,396
Who, me?
And you were married, too.

244
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,119
God forbid!

245
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,190
Of course I didn't believe a word.

246
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,956
But now that you brought me
God knows where...

247
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,152
You believe that nutcase?
Whose house is this?

248
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,434
Mine!

249
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,955
It's my house! I live here!

250
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,835
Understand?

251
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,877
This is my writing desk,
my typewriter,

252
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,835
a page from my novel,

253
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,477
a sentence I left unfinished
to be on time for our date...

254
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,158
Domident toothpaste...

255
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,631
Fresh towels...

256
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,715
My built in closet, with my clothes...

257
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,875
The photo album...

258
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,036
What more do you want?
Your number.

259
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,828
Sorry?

260
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,310
Your phone number. I don't have it.

261
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,831
2236877.

262
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,913
Let's call your place

263
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,832
and see who picks up.

264
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,599
It's ringing!

265
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,677
You hear? It's ringing!

266
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,238
Hello? Ovidiu?

267
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,159
Yes!

268
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,033
He is not at home?

269
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,952
I'll call back another time.

270
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,955
Wrong number.

271
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,198
Let me drop you off!
Are you sure it's your car?

272
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,670
Where are you going alone,
at this hour?

273
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,276
Here.

274
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,599
After that, I gave you a call.

275
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,713
You're all the same.

276
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,554
You get dumped
and run back to your wives.

277
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,553
Come on.

278
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,149
Shocked? Since I started with Pepe,
I don't do it anymore.

279
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,999
I changed careers.

280
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,834
Coming, darling?

281
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,639
I bet you've never been
with an experienced woman before.

282
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,953
Otherwise you wouldn't run
after cheap Barbies.

283
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,157
Ready to wake up, Sir?

284
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,117
It's worth opening your eyes
on such a lovely day.

285
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,477
Besides, the publishers
from New York and Paris

286
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,916
are already here with the contracts.

287
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,672
What time is it?
It's 3 pm, sir.

288
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,872
And I'm serving your breakfast...
in bed.

289
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,275
Today it's Sunday, we're free.

290
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,110
You know what I was thinking?
No.

291
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,075
What about taking me to a restaurant?

292
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,719
Super!
That will really be a change.

293
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,799
Let's do it for real!
Drink, eat, the whole works.

294
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,511
Who's paying? I'm flat broke.

295
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,477
Nobody! We take up a collection.

296
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,872
What's our cut?

297
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,916
We don't get a cent!

298
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,873
But we can at least taste

299
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,157
all those delicacies
they put on our bills.

300
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,032
French champagne...

301
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,277
Seafood salad.

302
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,030
Chateaubriand flambé...

303
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,675
Manchurian caviar...
Tenderloin...

304
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,436
Trout in sauce...
Two coffees and dessert...

305
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,508
Exactly 2,700,000 lei.

306
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,753
Radu, Mircea and Alin
are next for the karaoke contest.

307
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,436
Sorry, we don't have that much.

308
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,354
I didn't hear you.
It's too much!

309
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,993
I didn't hear you.

310
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,556
I can leave you my papers,

311
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,150
and come back tomorrow and pay.

312
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,914
Don't give me that crap.
I want to see cash.

313
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,631
And on with the karaoke!

314
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,152
Now we're going to hear
an all time classic.

315
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,471
He's going to kill my husband!
Please calm down!

316
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,879
Wait a minute, let's talk!

317
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,273
Don't worry,
we'll have a talk you and I.

318
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,074
Let's behave like civilized people...

319
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,239
Playing games, smart ass?

320
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,916
You want me to pay
out of my own pocket?

321
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,633
Out of my own pocket?

322
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,353
For you, motherfucker?

323
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,471
Out of my own pocket?

324
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,312
Have some more!

325
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,189
Some more?

326
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,553
Some more?

327
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,959
SAVAGE BEATING
IN FANC Y RESTAU RANT

328
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,757
You could have smiled a little.

329
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,948
The eyes look more convincing
than the mouth.

330
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,191
Not a bad job, though.

331
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,756
Would his mother recognize him?

332
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,713
The "Popescus"?

333
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,235
The most widespread Romanian name.

334
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,318
Don t you recognize my style?
You didn't sign.

335
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,355
I don't sign everything.

336
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,634
How many suckers
were taken in by this story?

337
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,199
Only one, isn't it?

338
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,156
Only one sucker, Miruna?

339
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,073
My sweet, my darling,
my little moustache,

340
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,231
can you leave us alone for a minute?

341
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,115
Yes, your wife was in on it too.
Guess who else.

342
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,910
The waiter.
Of course. And who else?

343
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,318
The voice on the answering machine...

344
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,434
Saturday night...

345
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,955
Ungureanu.

346
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,429
Bingo! You ve just won a color TV!

347
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,753
No joke. Tomorrow evening
you'll be both on live TV.

348
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,110
Who?
Who do you think?

349
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,918
You two, the Popescus!

350
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,310
Face to face with the people,
on ProTV.

351
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,319
Don't count on me.

352
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,351
Unbelievable!
Is nothing moving in here?

353
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,509
Has all activity stopped?
General strike?

354
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,752
Hello! Anybody home?

355
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,833
Mr. Puiutz, our collaboration
has come to an end.

356
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,034
Zorro, stay calm! We have to prepare
tomorrow's broadcast.

357
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,840
We've done two weeks training for this.

358
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,312
There's a lot of money at stake.

359
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,551
But above all, we are going
to create a masterpiece.

360
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,714
Doesn't that word dazzle you,
Mr. Writer? Masterpiece!

361
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,437
You take me for someone else.
Let's set things straight.

362
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,192
My name is not Popescu.
The lady here is not my wife.

363
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,189
I'm not even a real writer,
unfortunately.

364
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,877
I'm just a school teacher
who has to teach his students

365
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,474
masterpieces
of Romanian literature.

366
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,509
Any remarks about my face

367
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,237
and I'll confiscate cell phones.
Be warned.

368
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,435
Take out a blank page.
Draw a margin.

369
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,830
Is Robert Dobrovicescu here?

370
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,031
He's been absent for days. Why?

371
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,718
Can we have a talk?
One second.

372
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,273
"Patriotic sentiment
in the poetry of 1848."

373
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,352
And we work in silence, okay?

374
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,554
I'm listening.

375
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,471
Do us a favor.

376
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,678
If the boy shows up
in the next few days,

377
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,272
give him a message from us.

378
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,876
From us? Meaning?

379
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,469
Doesn't matter. Say two gentlemen.

380
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,513
The important thing is the message.
Listen up.

381
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,432
The Baron is very upset.

382
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,717
He wants the money in three days.

383
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,589
If the boy doesn't show up
with the cash and some apologies...

384
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,354
Life is complex and full of surprises.

385
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,439
I don't get it.

386
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,275
He didn't get it.
Your turn.

387
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,555
The boy trashed a brand new car.

388
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,718
The owner is really upset.

389
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,195
Really upset, that's the message.

390
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,830
He wants money for the damage
and he sent us talk to the boy.

391
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,359
If he plays hide and seek,
we'll find him even in Vladivostok.

392
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,399
And it might be worse.

393
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,869
How much does he owe?
He knows.

394
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,034
He should be a smart kid
and realize that...

395
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,875
life is complex and full of surprises.

396
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,349
He's young and it'd be a shame
to have him crippled...

397
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,989
Or worse...
You never know.

398
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,478
How much money, did you say?

399
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,079
3,000 bucks...

400
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,795
It's the thought that counts,
not the money.

401
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,911
That's enough!

402
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,676
One move and I'll squeeze one off!

403
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,192
God dammit!
You fucking with school?

404
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,718
Write your essays!

405
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,516
Who did that to your face?

406
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,319
Nobody.

407
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,870
If you want revenge,
we'll do it for a minimum charge.

408
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,710
Don't let me see any copying.

409
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,352
3,000 dollars...

410
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,672
Bucescu! The cell phone!

411
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,357
Florin...

412
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,388
Calinescu...

413
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,316
brings you "Scandal of the Day",

414
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,716
talk show of the new millennium!

415
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,913
Tonight, we have three special guests!

416
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,755
Good evening to all of you.
I am Florin Calinescu

417
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,672
and I have to tell you I'm disgusted.
Fed up.

418
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,479
This morning, looking for
some new ideas for the show

419
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,876
I suddenly realized I'm fed up.

420
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,908
I'm sick of politicians,
sick of the Parliament's big talk,

421
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,271
sick of public and political scandals.

422
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,957
Where are the ordinary people
with their everyday problems?

423
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,710
Where are you, people who
watch my show every night?

424
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,832
Let us meet an ordinary couple

425
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,514
who's struggling hard, like you,

426
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,194
like myself,
to pay the huge cost of transition.

427
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,472
And the core of their story
is precisely a bill.

428
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,514
Ladies and gentlemen,

429
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,079
on my right,
Ovidiu and Miruna Popescu.

430
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,636
And on my left,
Mr. George Stanete,

431
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,550
waiter at the Karaoke Club.
He's going to tell us what happened.

432
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,949
Good evening.

433
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:51,118
Mr. Stanete, could you describe,
in your own words,

434
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,352
the incident that occurred
two days ago?

435
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,397
These two came to the restaurant,

436
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,070
they ate and drank all evening

437
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,591
and then refused to pay

438
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,594
on account
that they had no money.

439
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,232
I can't go to my boss
with an unpaid bill for 2 million lei.

440
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,716
He'd fire me.
So what did you do?

441
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,156
I worked him over a little.

442
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,910
Could we have
a camera on Mr. Popescu?

443
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,670
Is this what you call "a little"?

444
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,638
A little, at first...

445
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,233
Later...

446
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,473
we got heated.

447
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,479
Before hearing
Mr. Popescu's side of the story,

448
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,070
here's the telephone number to call

449
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,431
with your questions and comments.

450
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,233
Please write it down.

451
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,633
Hello, this is ProTV.

452
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,471
That night was
your 10th wedding anniversary.

453
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,912
Yes. My husband had saved
some money for the occasion.

454
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,549
And I insisted we go out.

455
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,593
Usually we can't afford to.

456
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,798
What is your monthly income?

457
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,795
We earn 3 million lei between us.

458
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,954
Where are my glasses?

459
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,069
In 65 years, I've never lost anything.

460
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,434
That's your fault!
Where did you put my glasses?

461
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,353
Remember our 40th anniversary?

462
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,510
I washed your socks
while you were watching Colombo.

463
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,872
Shut up! I'm waiting to go live.

464
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,472
It's a scam!

465
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,516
Come here,
you have to see this!

466
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,474
We ve never had great ambitions.

467
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,756
Maybe we hoped for a better life...

468
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,438
Remember her?

469
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,558
The couple who couldn't pay
at The Polenta.

470
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,959
It's a scam!

471
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,597
Tell us how you first met.

472
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,796
He wrote me a poem...

473
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,994
I was in a crowded tram.

474
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,430
He slipped a piece of paper
into my purse.

475
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,515
I found it when I took out money
to pay the fine: I had no ticket...

476
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,077
I always carry it with me.

477
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,793
"The smile she gave me in that tram
Was shining with a million lies,

478
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,669
"My life became a traffic jam

479
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,560
"And so did Mr. Ion Susai's."

480
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,235
Who was Mr. Ion Susai?

481
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,916
A friend of mine,
you don't know him.

482
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,795
Florin, we can take calls.

483
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,637
The control room
tells me we have a call.

484
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,035
Good evening
to you and your guests.

485
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,349
Good evening.

486
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,792
I'm Pavel Puiutz
from the Filantropica Foundation.

487
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,271
I've read this story

488
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,597
in the papers and
I am deeply shaken.

489
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,675
These two people

490
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,199
are not vagrants.

491
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,395
They both have jobs,

492
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,229
both earn salaries.
And yet our society denies them

493
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,830
a decent life,
and a minimum of respect!

494
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,316
I totally agree with you.

495
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,798
Do you have a question
for one of our guests?

496
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,194
An announcement.

497
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,836
This morning, my foundation

498
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,235
opened a bank account
in Mr. Popescu's name

499
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,076
at the Romanian Bank for Prosperity.

500
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,556
We've already made a deposit

501
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,797
and we'd like
the account number displayed,

502
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,988
so that other people
will be able to help this couple too.

503
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,679
Mr. Puiutz, say the number
and we will display it on the screen.

504
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,311
The number is...

505
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,072
It's my turn!

506
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,474
Can't see a thing!

507
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,630
We have a second call.
Mr. Gorea from Bucharest.

508
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,309
Do you hear me?

509
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,472
Perfectly.

510
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,074
Good evening to you and your guests.

511
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,829
Good evening.

512
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,998
I want to ask one question.

513
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,032
The government has promised
to increase pensions.

514
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,197
When?
We haven't seen anything yet!

515
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,195
Do you have any idea
of what we're talking about?

516
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,477
Of course!
But these youngsters you've invited,

517
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,272
they go to restaurants

518
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,069
and don't care about
old people with low pensions!

519
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,233
Thank you for your contribution.

520
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,632
It seems we have another call.

521
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,635
Mr. Fotica from Bucharest.

522
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,994
I have to tell you
these two are pulling your chain.

523
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,312
Please mind your language.

524
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,520
Just let me explain.

525
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,473
I've seen these crooks
last Thursday at The Polenta,

526
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,591
doing the same lousy routine!

527
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,917
Some customers paid for them,
myself included.

528
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,395
Believe me, they're pulling your leg!

529
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,150
This is a serious accusation.

530
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,389
Any reaction?

531
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,312
It's absurd! How can he imagine...

532
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,755
Lies!
I've never worked at The Polenta.

533
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,871
I'm sure it's a mistake.

534
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,799
I'm afraid not.

535
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,874
It seems this gentleman
has seen us someplace.

536
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,638
No point in trying to hide it.

537
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,670
Maybe you'd like to tell us more.

538
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,796
Maybe one night I kicked you out
of a club, with the help of security.

539
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,111
Right!
You made waves, at The Cool Club.

540
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,918
At The Cool Club?

541
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,955
Lmagine that,
the places I frequent.

542
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,433
Soon we'll hear
we were on the Riviera,

543
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,120
or in the Securitate,
during Ceausescu's time!

544
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,434
Just a nice practical joke at the phone,
a good laugh...

545
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,716
It's no joke, Mr. Florin!

546
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,272
You're with friends, aren't you?
I hear voices and music.

547
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,714
Is that a problem?

548
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,798
I have a question for you.

549
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,397
What form of transport did you use,
that evening,

550
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,353
to go to the restaurant
where you saw us?

551
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,230
My own car.
Your own car?

552
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,555
What do you do for a living?
I'm a student.

553
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,319
And what do you study?

554
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,195
I study in a private university.

555
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,314
Now I will show you something.

556
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,711
Please bring the camera
as close as possible

557
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,394
so everyone can see it.

558
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,794
I will bet Mr. Student here

559
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,878
has no idea how much this costs
or how to use it.

560
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,276
Will you take the bet?
Why not?

561
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,120
It could be interesting.

562
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,596
Mr. Fotica?
Yes!

563
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,672
If you're still there...

564
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,357
Tell us how much
is a tram ticket these days?

565
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,792
Personally, I've lost track.

566
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:02,158
Come on, Mr. Florin!
Don't you see he's playing the crowd?

567
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,396
Speaking of playing the crowd,

568
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,589
instead of wasting your time
with cheap science fiction,

569
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,550
I suggest you take the tram or the bus,

570
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,639
at least once a year,
just out of curiosity.

571
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,556
You'd see a bit of real life

572
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,429
and maybe you'll feel less
like playing jokes on TV.

573
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,036
Don't make fun of what
you don't understand, Mr. Student.

574
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,274
If life blessed you with rich parents,

575
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,550
try at least to be... more modest

576
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,999
if you can.

577
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,954
We'll be back after the break.

578
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,879
Want to make a deposit?

579
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,030
I want to withdraw
the equivalent of 3,000 U SD.

580
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,955
At the current rate of exchange,

581
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,669
that makes 90,540,000 lei.

582
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,359
Password, please.

583
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,475
Password?

584
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,156
Yes, your account is protected.

585
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,835
You can't withdraw
without the password.

586
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,598
Can't do it...

587
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,274
leave a poor man
without his last penny...

588
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,635
What did you think I do, charity?

589
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,595
He's a rookie.
He doesn't know the ropes.

590
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,593
The word copyright doesn't ring a bell?

591
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,188
Yesterday on TV
you talked different.

592
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,910
Maybe. You too had lower claims,
at the beginning.

593
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,439
Come on, boys!

594
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,511
We've been working nights,
we've been working days...

595
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,156
Don't be sulky. Have a drink!

596
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,715
What if I tell the police?

597
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,039
Slow down, boys!

598
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,869
What did you say?

599
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,152
He's really is a rookie.

600
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,914
How about singing a happy song?

601
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,071
Give me 3,000 dollars, as a loan.

602
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,919
3,000 dollars?

603
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,074
What manners,
after everything I taught you!

604
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,753
"Give me!"

605
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,717
I need it.
He needs it.

606
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,391
You've flunked out, teacher.

607
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,911
You'll have to revise a little.

608
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,996
Come back and impress me!

609
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,479
Move me! Bring me to tears!

610
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,709
Tell me about the poor Cinderella
you're trying to help.

611
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,789
What does she need? A fur coat?
A cozy apartment?

612
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,077
An out stretched hand
without a story to tell gets no charity!

613
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,392
Be a pro, for God's sake!

614
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,634
Popescu.

615
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,033
What happened?

616
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,033
No strings attached.

617
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,199
What is this?

618
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,713
It's for Robert.

619
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,640
He needs it.
But don't tell him it's from me.

620
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,791
That boy is a bum.
He doesn't deserve your help.

621
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,630
Let him fend for himself.
What can he do?

622
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,077
I'm telling you now,
so you won't regret it later.

623
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,113
I have to run along.

624
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,032
Remember where I live?

625
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,993
Drop by at 9 p.m.
6th floor, apartment 46.

626
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,879
I'll be waiting.

627
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,835
Mom!

628
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,832
Sleeping with your clothes on...

629
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,439
Why didn't you wake me up?

630
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,630
I didn't have the heart to.

631
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,519
You must call a certain Mr. Puiutz...

632
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,193
Looking for the young lady?
Miss Diana, yes.

633
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,592
She went out earlier.
At about 7 pm.

634
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,952
Rex! Down!

635
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,960
You're looking for the girl
who's on TV?

636
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,079
Do you know where she went?

637
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,032
Domident! Anywhere!

638
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,393
She had a suitcase
and she was in a hurry.

639
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,994
But who are you?

640
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,795
Cheers.

641
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,117
Let's hear another one.

642
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,917
"Romanian girls are
using more and more"

643
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,517
"Those beautiful,
expensive German cars"

644
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,070
"But they still love their country
like before"

645
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,237
"In spite of their big crush
on German cars"

646
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,834
Divine.

647
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,069
Say it once more, I want to learn it.

648
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,828
1213 years old,
are you interested?

649
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,359
Robert?

650
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,989
What are you doing here?

651
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,035
I'm hiding.

652
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,556
It's all right. You can go home.

653
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,672
What's all right?
The money. We got it.

654
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,349
No shit!

655
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,472
You had a stroke of luck.

656
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,271
Go home and talk to Diana.

657
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,599
Diana, your sister.

658
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,077
You're really stoned.

659
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,111
I haven't got a sister.
Sure!

660
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,599
Must've been my sister
who came to school...

661
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,754
That one...

662
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,557
She's not my sister.

663
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,628
She's a girl from the block.
I sent her to bullshit you.

664
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,878
You can't lend me 3,000 U SD,
can you?

665
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,679
Not really, man.

666
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,830
Don't laugh. I can't either.

667
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,919
You know, Robert...

668
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,959
There are plenty people in this world

669
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,476
who aren't worth
lifting one finger for.

670
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,558
You're top of the list.

671
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,316
Even the Baron's thugs
are more fun than you are.

672
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,398
So, why did I break my ass
trying to save your skin?

673
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,759
Let's go.

674
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,588
You have to sleep.

675
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,234
I'm taking you to a lady friend.
You'll be safe there.

676
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:51,153
I've located him.
He took a cab from the station.

677
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,629
Is this your stop? That'll be 50,000.

678
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,394
Beat it.

679
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,389
Run!

680
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,514
What do you want?

681
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,354
Here he is.

682
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,115
Where have you been?
Your wife was worried stiff.

683
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,476
You scared me to death!
What happened?

684
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,911
I can't believe it. You're drunk!

685
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,278
One doesn't earn that much everyday!

686
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,112
This calls for a drink.

687
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,800
He who never touches alcohol...
He looks fine!

688
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,956
How do you feel
about all this support?

689
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,997
What are your plans for the money?

690
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,191
Please, one at a time!

691
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,198
I'm happy for this couple.

692
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,990
Our foundation prefers to help
one person in difficulty

693
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,478
instead of spreading popcorn
to hundreds.

694
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,231
Sorry, it's too crowded over there.

695
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,948
Marriage certificate.

696
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,114
Let's have a picture
of you and your wife.

697
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,717
Enough for tonight.
Let them catch their breath.

698
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:20,309
Thank you all and good luck.
You are always welcome.

699
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,588
That's all. I'll go home myself.

700
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,116
Hope you have everything you need.

701
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,072
Mr. Popescu...

702
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:35,632
May I remind you that you owe me,
morally and materially.

703
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,553
3,000 dollars.

704
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,031
Don't bother, I know my way out.

705
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:48,832
We've been working days,
we've been working nights...

706
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,115
It's late. Shall we go to bed?

707
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,038
We'll clean up tomorrow.

708
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,639
What time do you get up?

709
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,636
Eight. I have to be at work at nine.

710
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,435
Wake me up too, I'll fix breakfast.

711
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,236
It's all right.
I'll make myself some eggs.

712
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,438
Darling, not tonight.
I'm very tired.

713
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,197
Do you mind?
No, I understand.

714
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,279
I'm going to write for a while.

715
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,869
If I fall asleep,
will you turn the TV off?

716
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,639
Honey...

717
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,599
Can you believe it? Ten years!

718
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,800
They passed
as though they were days.

719
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,314
"The night wormed
silently into the city"

720
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,916
"like the hand of a thief in my pocket."

721
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,078
No, don Pepe.

722
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:35,720
"...like me,
in bed with my sleeping wife."

723
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,193
Babe! Are you free tonight?

724
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,479
What do we have here?

725
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,115
Get in the car!

726
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,148
Why?

727
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,636
"Punk kid chased by thugs."

728
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,550
"He's better off begging,
than stealing."

729
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,871
You feel pity for this little scumbag,

730
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:44,078
this creep,
this suburban piece of shit?

731
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,236
Watch your...
Shut up!

732
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,793
You feel pity?

733
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,598
I've got your money!
