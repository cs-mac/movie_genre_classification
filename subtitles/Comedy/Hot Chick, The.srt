1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
25.000 English

2
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,720
Some Like It Hot (1959)

3
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,760
All right, Charlie.

4
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,760
- That the joint? Who runs it?
- I already told you.

5
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,040
- Refresh my memory.
- Spats Colombo.

6
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,360
- What's the password?
- "I've come to Grandma's funeral."

7
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,560
- Your admission card.
- Thanks, Charlie.

8
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,040
If you want a ringside table,
just say you're a pallbearer.

9
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,160
We're all set. Whens the kickoff?

10
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,240
I'd better blow.
If Colombo sees me, it's goodbye, Charlie.

11
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,360
Goodbye, Charlie.

12
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,640
Give me five minutes,
then hit 'em with everything you got.

13
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,800
You betcha.

14
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,600
Good evening, sir.

15
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,280
- I'm Mr Mozarella. What can I do for you?
- I've come to the old lady's funeral.

16
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,680
I haven't seen you at our services before.

17
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,000
- No, I've been on the wagon.
- Please.

18
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,600
Where is the wake?
I'm one of the pallbearers.

19
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,600
Show the gentleman into the chapel.
Pew number three.

20
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes, Mr Mozarella. This way, sir.

21
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,880
Well, if you gotta go,
that's the way to do it.

22
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,200
Follow me, please.

23
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,000
- What'll it be, sir?
- Booze.

24
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,280
- Sorry. We only serve coffee.
- Coffee?

25
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,200
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee,
sour mash coffee...

26
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,000
Scotch. Make it a demitasse,
with soda on the side.

27
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,680
Wait a minute. Haven't you got
a pew not so close to the band?

28
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,600
How about that one over there?

29
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,600
Sorry, but that's reserved
for members of the immediate family.

30
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,680
Oops.

31
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,200
Hey, I want another cup of coffee.

32
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,880
I want another cup of coffee.

33
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,680
Better bring a check
in case the joint is raided.

34
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,880
- Who's gonna raid a funeral?
- Some people don't respect the dead.

35
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,880
Say, Joe. Tonight's the night, isn't it?

36
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,400
- I'll say.
- No, tonight we get paid.

37
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,000
- Why?
- I've got to see a dentist tomorrow.

38
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,000
You wanna blow
your first week's pay on your teeth?

39
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,800
Just a filling. Doesn't have to be gold.

40
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,080
How can you be so selfish? We owe rent.
We owe $89 to Moe's Delicatessen.

41
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,400
The Chinese laundry is suing us.
We owe money to every girl in the line.

42
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,400
You're right. Tomorrow we'll pay
everyone something on account.

43
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,480
No. Tomorrow we go to the dog track
and bet it all on Greased Lightning.

44
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,200
- You'd bet my money on a dog?
- He's a shoo-in.

45
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,440
Max the waiter knows the electrician
that wires the rabbit.

46
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,120
- What are you givin' me with a rabbit?
- The odds are 10 to 1.

47
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,840
- Suppose he loses.
- Why worry? This job'll last a long time.

48
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,840
- Suppose it doesn't.
- Jerry boy, why paint everyzhing black?

49
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,320
Suppose you got hit by a truck.
Suppose the stock market crashes.

50
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,240
Suppose Mary Pickford
divorces Douglas Fairbanks.

51
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,120
Suppose the Dodgers leave Brooklyn.

52
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,240
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows.

53
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,920
Well, don't look now,
but the whole town is underwater.

54
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,440
Four,

55
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,840
three,

56
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,320
two,

57
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,640
one.

58
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,440
All right, everybody. This is a raid.

59
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,440
I'm a federal agent.
You're all under arrest.

60
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,840
I want another cup of coffee.

61
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,840
All right, Spats.

62
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,520
- The services are over. Let's go.
- Go where?

63
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,520
A country club for retired bootleggers.
I'm puttin' you up for membership.

64
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,520
- I don't join nothin'.
- Oh, you'll like it there.

65
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,120
I'll get the prison tailor to fit you
with a pair of special spats - striped.

66
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,240
Big joke. What's the rap this time?

67
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,320
Embalming people with coffee. 86 proof.

68
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,440
Me? I'm just a customer.

69
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,840
Oh, come on, Spats. We know you own
the joint. Mozarella's just frontin' for you.

70
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,040
- Mozarella? Never heard of him.
- We got different information.

71
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,920
From who? Toothpick Charlie maybe?

72
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,720
Toothpick Charlie? Never heard of him.

73
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,440
Buttermilk.

74
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,120
Too smart to drink your own stuff, huh?

75
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,120
Come on. On your feet.

76
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,040
- You're wastin' the taxpayers' money.
- Call your lawyer if you wanna.

77
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,920
These are my lawyers. All Harvard men.

78
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,640
I wan' another cuppa coffee.

79
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,840
That solves one problem. Now we don't
have to worry about who to pay first.

80
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,760
- Quiet. I'm thinking.
- The landlady will lock us out.

81
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,480
At Moe's Deli no
more knockwurst on credit.

82
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,760
We can't borrow from the girls -
they're on the way to jail.

83
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,160
I wonder how much Sam the bookie
will give us for our overcoats.

84
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,760
Sam the bookie? Nothin' doin'.
You're not puttin' my overcoat on a dog.

85
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,880
- Jerry, I told you, it's a sure thing.
- We will freeze.

86
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,280
It is below zero. We'll get pneumonia.

87
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,960
Look, stupid, he's 10-1.
Tomorrow we'll have 20 overcoats.

88
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,560
Greased Lightning.

89
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,360
- I oughta have my head examined.
- I thought you weren't talkin' to me.

90
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,680
The bull fiddle's
dressed warmer than I am.

91
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,880
- Anyzhing today?
- Nothing.

92
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,560
Thank you.

93
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,680
- Anyzhing today?
- Nothing.

94
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,360
Thank you.

95
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,680
I can't go on, Joe. I'm weak from hunger,
I got a fever, I got a hole in my shoe...

96
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,480
If you gave me a chance,
we could be living like kings.

97
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,680
- How?
- There's a dog running in the third.

98
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,160
Galloping Ghost. He's 15-1 and it's
his kind of a track. He's a real mudder.

99
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,760
What do you want from me?
My head on a plate?

100
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,560
No, your bass.
If we hock that and my sax...

101
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,280
Are you crazy? We're up the creek
and you wanna hock the paddle.

102
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,360
All right, go ahead and starve.
What do I care? Freeze.

103
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,080
- Anyzhing today?
- Oh, it's you.

104
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,080
Well, you've got a lot of nerve.

105
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,080
Thank you.

106
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,160
Joe. Come back here.

107
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,480
Nellie, baby, if it's about Saturday night,
I can explain.

108
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,760
What a heel. I spend $4
to get my hair marcelled,

109
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,880
I buy me a brand-new negligee,

110
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,960
I bake him a great big pizza pie.

111
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,960
- And where were you?
- Where were you?

112
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,280
- With you.
- Me?

113
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,280
Remember? You had this bad tooth.

114
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,560
It was impacted. His jaw was swoll out.

115
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,680
It was?

116
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,760
Oh, yeah.

117
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,280
- I took him for a blood transfusion.
- We have the same type blood.

118
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,080
- Type O.
- Oh?

119
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,080
- I'll make it up to you.
- You're makin' it up pretty good so far.

120
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,480
As soon as we get a job, I'll take you
to the swellest restaurant in town.

121
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,280
How about it? Has Poliakoff got
anyzhing for us? We're desperate.

122
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,960
Well, it just so happens
he is looking for a bass.

123
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,680
And a sax.

124
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,280
Right?

125
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,760
Right.

126
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,560
- What's the job?
- Three weeks in Florida.

127
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,480
At the Seminole-Ritz in Miami.
Transportation and expenses all paid.

128
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,680
Isn't she a bit of terrific?
Let's see Poliakoff.

129
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,280
- He's busy. You'll have to wait, boys.
- All right, we'll wait.

130
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,880
Look, Gladys, it's three weeks in Florida.

131
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,280
Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators.

132
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,360
They need a couple of girls
on sax and bass.

133
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,160
Whaddaya mean, who is it?
It's Poliakoff. I got a job for ya.

134
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,880
Gladys. Are ya there?

135
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,160
Gladys!

136
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,280
Meshugeneh.
Played 112 hours at a marathon dance.

137
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,680
- Now she's in bed with nervous collapse.
- Tell her to move over.

138
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,280
And Cora Jackson?

139
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,800
Last I heard, she was playin'
with the Salvation Army.

140
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,920
Drexel 9044.

141
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,920
Those idiot broads.

142
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,720
Here we are, packed and ready to leave
for Miami, and what happens?

143
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,920
The sax runs off with a Bible salesman
and the bass gets pregnant.

144
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,920
Bienstock, I oughta fire you.

145
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,120
Me? I'm the manager,
not the night watchman.

146
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,800
Hello. Let me talk to Bessie Malone.

147
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,400
What's she doing in Philadelphia?

148
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,800
On the level?

149
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,600
Bessie let her hair grow
and is playing with Stokowski.

150
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,320
- Black Bottom Bessie?
- Schpielt zich mit der Philharmonic.

151
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,320
How about Rosemary Schultz?

152
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,520
Slashed her wrists when Valentino died.

153
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,200
We might as well do the same
if we don't find two dames by tonight.

154
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,520
We don't care where you find them.
Just get them on that train by 8 o'clock.

155
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,400
The moment anyzhing turns up,
I'll give you a tinkle.

156
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,200
Bye, Sig. I wonder
if I've got room for another ulcer.

157
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,520
Nellie, get me long-distance.

158
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,920
- Sig, we wanna talk to you.
- About the Florida job.

159
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,320
- Nellie told us about it.
- Not too late, are we?

160
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,720
What are ya? Comedians? Get out.

161
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,600
The William Morris Agency in New York.

162
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,320
- You need a bass and a sax?
- The instruments are right but you're not.

163
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,720
I wanna speak to Mr Morris.

164
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,320
- What's wrong with us?
- You're the wrong shape.

165
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,400
- What do you want? Hunchbacks?
- It's not the backs that worry me.

166
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,920
What kind of a band is it?

167
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,320
- You gotta be under 25.
- We could pass for that.

168
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,920
- And blond.
- We could dye our hair.

169
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,320
And you gotta be girls.

170
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,600
No, we couldn't.

171
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,720
- Mr William Morris.
- You mean this is a girls' band?

172
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,200
Yeah. Good old Nellie.
I could wring her neck.

173
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,600
Let's talk this over. Why couldn't we do it?

174
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,800
When we worked in the gypsy tearoom,
we wore gold earrings.

175
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,120
When you booked us with
the Hawaiian band, we wore grass skirts.

176
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,320
- What's with him? He drinks?
- No, he ain't eatin' so good.

177
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
His empty stomach has gone to his head.

178
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,400
Joe, three weeks in Florida. We could
borrow clothes from the chorus girls.

179
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,720
- You've flipped your wig.
- Now you're talking.

180
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,320
We get second-hand wigs, a little padding.

181
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,800
We call ourselves
Josephine and Geraldine.

182
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,120
Josephine and Geraldine... Come on.

183
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,720
If you wanna pick up
a little money tonight,

184
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,720
at the University of Illinois
they're havin' a St Valentine's dance.

185
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,320
We'll take it.

186
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,120
$6 a man. Be on the campus
at Urbana at 8 o'clock.

187
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,800
All the way to Urbana
for a one-night stand?

188
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,920
It's $12. We can get
one of the overcoats out of hock.

189
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,520
Hello. Mr Morris?
This is Poliakoff in Chicago.

190
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,320
You don't have two girl musicians
available, do you?

191
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,920
A sax player and a bass?

192
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,720
- If William Morris doesn't come through...
- Come on, Geraldine.

193
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,720
It's 100 miles. It's snowin' outside.
How do we get there?

194
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,600
- I'll find something.
- Like what?

195
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,120
Don't crowd me.

196
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,600
- How'd it go, girls?
- I oughta wring your neck.

197
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,320
Please, Jerry. That's no way to talk.

198
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,400
Nellie baby, what are you doin' tonight?

199
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,120
- Tonight? Why?
- Cos I've got some plans.

200
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,520
- I'm not doing anything.
- Really?

201
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,600
I just thought I'd go home
and have some cold pizza.

202
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,720
Then you'll be in all evening?

203
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,520
Yes, Joe.

204
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,720
Good. Then you won't
be needing your car.

205
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,840
My car? Why, you...

206
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,160
Isn't he a bit of terrific?

207
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,360
We coulda had three weeks
in Florida, all expenses paid.

208
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,040
Lyin' in the sun, palm trees, flyin' fish...

209
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,160
Knock it off, will ya?

210
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,240
Possible straight, possible nothing,
and a pair of eights.

211
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,160
All right, drop 'em, you guys.

212
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,440
- Drop what?
- We came for a car.

213
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,040
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Nellie Weinmeyer's car.

214
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,960
Musicians.

215
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,440
Wise guys.

216
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,960
OK, let's go. Aces bet.

217
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,840
It's a '25 Hupmobile, green, coupe... sir.

218
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,240
- It's over here.
- Yeah, over here.

219
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,160
- Want some gas?
- Yeah, about 40 cents' worth, please.

220
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,560
- Put it on Miss Weinmeyer's bill?
- Yeah. Why not?

221
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,160
And while you're at it, fill it up.

222
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,760
All right, everybody. Hands up.

223
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,760
Face the wall.

224
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,160
You too, Toothpick.

225
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,160
Come on.

226
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
Come on.

227
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,560
Hey. Join us.

228
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,560
OK, boss.

229
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,840
Hello, Charlie. Long time no see.

230
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,840
- Spats, what are you doin' here?
- I just dropped in to pay my respects.

231
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,360
- You don't owe me nothin'.
- I wouldn't say that.

232
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,960
You recommended
my mortuary to your friends.

233
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,360
- I don't know what you mean.
- Now I got all those coffins on my hands.

234
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,960
- I hate to see 'em go to waste.
- I had nothin' to do with it.

235
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,960
Too bad, Charlie.
You woulda had three eights.

236
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,360
- Goodbye, Charlie.
- No, Spats, no.

237
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,440
No, Spats. Please, no.

238
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,840
I think I'm gonna be sick.

239
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,640
All right, come on outta there.

240
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,360
Come on.

241
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,760
Come on.

242
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,360
- We didn't see anyzhing. Did we?
- What? No. Not a thing.

243
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,200
Besides, it's none of our business
if you guys wanna bump each other off.

244
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,400
Say... Don't I know you two
from somewhere?

245
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,080
Oh, no. We're just a couple of musicians.

246
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,800
We came to pick up a car.
Nellie Weinmeyer's car.

247
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,880
There's a dance tonight.

248
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,280
- Come on, Jerry.
- Wait a minute.

249
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,680
- Where do you think you're goin'?
- Urbana. It's about 100 miles from here...

250
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,680
You're not goin' nowhere.

251
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,880
- We're not?
- I don't like no witnesses.

252
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,200
- We won't breathe a word.
- You won't breathe nothin'.

253
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,280
Not even air.

254
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,000
All right, boys, let's blow out of here.
We'll take care of those guys later.

255
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
I think they got me.

256
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,400
- They got the bull fiddle.
- No blood?

257
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,880
If they catch us, there'll be blood
all over. Type O. Come on.

258
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,000
- Where are you running?
- As far away as possible.

259
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,600
It's not far enough. Those guys know us.
Every hood in Chicago will be after us.

260
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,680
Quick, gimme a nickel.

261
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,200
You're gonna call the police?

262
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,600
We'd never live to testify
against Spats Colombo.

263
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,200
We gotta get out of town.
We could grow beards.

264
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,800
We will get out of town,
but we're gonna shave.

265
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,480
At a time like this? They wanna blast
our heads off, and you wanna shave.

266
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,880
- Shave our legs, stupid.
- Shave our legs...?

267
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,280
Hello. Mr Poliakoff?

268
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,880
I understand you're looking
for a couple of girl musicians.

269
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,800
Florida Limited leaving
on track one for Washington,

270
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,080
Charleston, Savannah,
Jacksonville and Miami.

271
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,600
All aboard.

272
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,680
What now?

273
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,520
How do they keep their
balance in these things?

274
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,440
Must be the way the weight
is distributed. Now come on.

275
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,520
It is so draughty.

276
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,640
They must catch cold all the time.

277
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,520
- Quit stalling. We'll miss the train.
- I feel naked.

278
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,720
- I feel like everybody's starin' at me.
- With those legs? Are you crazy?

279
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,640
It's no use. We're not gonna
get away with it, Joe.

280
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,440
My name is Josephine, and this was
your idea in the first place.

281
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,840
Look at that. Look how she moves.

282
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,440
That's just like Jell-O on springs.

283
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,720
They must have some sort of
built-in motor or something.

284
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,040
I tell ya, it's a whole different sex.

285
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,720
Nobody's asking you to have a baby.

286
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,840
As soon as we're in Florida
we'll blow this whole setup.

287
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,720
You will not talk me into...

288
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,520
Extra. Extra. Seven slaughtered
in North Side garage.

289
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,040
Fear of bloody aftermath. Extra. Extra.

290
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,640
- You talked me into it. Let's go.
- Attagirl, Geraldine.

291
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,440
- Rosella.
- Fiddle.

292
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,440
- Move along, Dolores.
- Trombone.

293
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,840
- Hey, Olga, how's your back?
- Trumpet.

294
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,240
- Here we are.
- Are you two from the Poliakoff Agency?

295
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,040
- Yes. We're the new girls.
- Brand new.

296
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,120
This is our manager, Mr Bienstock.
And I'm Sweet Sue.

297
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,520
My name is Josephine.

298
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,840
I'm Daphne.

299
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,920
Saxophone, bass. Am I glad to see
you girls. You saved our lives.

300
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,720
Likewise, I'm sure.

301
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,840
Where did you girls play before?

302
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,040
Here, there and... around, and...

303
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,320
We spent three years
at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

304
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,640
All aboard.

305
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,720
You're in berths 7 and 7A.

306
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,840
7 and 7A.

307
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,840
- Thanks ever so.
- You're welcome.

308
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,920
Oh. The feeling's mutual.

309
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,120
- Upsy-daisy.
- Fresh.

310
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,040
Looks like Poliakoff sent
a couple of real ladies.

311
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,320
You'd better tell the other girls
to watch their language.

312
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,840
What are you...?

313
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,520
Daphne?

314
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,440
I never did like the name Geraldine.

315
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,920
Hi. I'm the bass fiddle.
Just call me Daphne.

316
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,120
My name is Josephine. Sax.

317
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,640
- Welcome to No Man's Land.
- You'll be sorry.

318
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,120
- Take off your corsets and spread out.
- Oh, I don't wear one myself.

319
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,240
- Don't you bulge?
- Bulge? Me?

320
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,720
I have the most divine seamstress.
Comes in just once a month.

321
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,280
- She is so inexpensive and she told...
- Come on, Daphne.

322
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,680
Say, do you know the one
about the girl tuba player

323
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,560
who was stranded on an island
with a one-legged jockey?

324
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,560
- No. How does it go?
- Cut it out, girls. No rough talk.

325
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,360
They went to a conservatory.

326
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,560
How about that talent, huh?

327
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,360
- Like fallin' into a tub of butter.
- Watch it, Daphne.

328
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,480
When I was a kid, Joe, I dreamed I was
locked up overnight in a pastry shop.

329
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,680
And there was goodies all around.

330
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,280
Jelly rolls, mocha ? clairs
and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts...

331
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,680
Listen to me: no butter, no pastry.
We're on a diet.

332
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,760
Yeah, sure, Joe.

333
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,480
Not there. That's the emergency brake.

334
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,280
Now you've done it.

335
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,160
- Done what?
- You tore off one of my chests.

336
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,480
- You'd better go get it fixed.
- You'd better come help me.

337
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,080
This way, Daphne.

338
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,080
Now you tore the other one.

339
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,360
Terribly sorry.

340
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,560
It's OK. I was scared it was Sweet Sue.

341
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,160
- You won't tell anybody, will you?
- Tell what?

342
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,480
If they catch me once more,
they'll kick me out of the band.

343
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,360
Are you the replacement
for the bass and sax?

344
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,480
That's us. And I'm Daphne.

345
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,480
This is Joe... sephine.

346
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,360
Come in.

347
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,280
I'm Sugar Cane.

348
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,280
- Sugar Cane?
- I changed it from Sugar Kowalczyk.

349
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,080
- Polish?
- Yes. I come from this musical family.

350
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,960
My mother's a piano teacher.
My father was a conductor.

351
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,680
- Where did he conduct?
- On the Baltimore and Ohio.

352
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,080
I play the ukulele, and I sing, too.

353
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,560
I don't have much of a voice,
but this isn't much of a band, either.

354
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,560
I'm only with them cos I'm running away.

355
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,560
- Running away from what?
- Oh, don't get me started on that.

356
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,280
Hey, you want some? It's bourbon.

357
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,080
I'll take a rain check.

358
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,080
I don't want you to think I'm a drinker.
I can stop if I want to, only I don't want to.

359
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,760
- Especially when I'm blue.
- We understand.

360
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,760
All the girls drink. But I'm the one
that gets caught. Story of my life.

361
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,880
I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.

362
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,560
Are my seams straight?

363
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,760
I'll say.

364
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,160
- See you around, girls.
- Bye, Sugar.

365
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,560
We have been playing
with the wrong bands.

366
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,360
- Down, Daphne.
- See the shape of that liquor cabinet?

367
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,280
Forget it. One false move
and we're off the train.

368
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,480
Then it's the police,
the papers and the Mob in Chicago.

369
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,680
Boy, would I love to
borrow a cup of that Sugar.

370
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,280
Look...

371
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,360
No pastry, no butter - and no Sugar.

372
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,760
You tore 'em again.

373
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,320
Hey, Sheboygan. What was your last job?
Playing square dances?

374
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,400
No. Funerals.

375
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,320
Would you mind rejoining the living?
Goose it up a little.

376
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,320
We'll try.

377
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,320
How did those holes get there?

378
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,920
Those?

379
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,920
I don't know.

380
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,520
Mice?

381
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,720
All right, girls. Let's take it from the top.
And put a little heat under it.

382
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,400
Bienstock!

383
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,520
Yes, Sue?

384
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,520
I thought I made it clear
that I don't want any drinking in this outfit.

385
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,400
All right, girls. Who does this belong to?

386
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,520
Come on, now. Speak up.

387
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,120
- Sugar, I warned you...
- Please, Mr Bienstock.

388
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,320
I've had it. In Kansas you smuggled
liquor in a shampoo bottle.

389
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,720
Before that you had
a pint in your ukelele...

390
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,520
Mr Bienstock, could I have my flask?

391
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,400
Sure. Pack your things.
At the next station... Your flask?

392
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,320
Yes. Just a little bourbon.
Must have slipped through.

393
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,600
Give me that.

394
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,520
Didn't you girls say
you went to a conservatory?

395
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,600
- Oh, yes. For a whole year.
- I thought you said three years.

396
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,400
We got time off for good behaviour.

397
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:40,200
There are two things I will not put up with
during working hours: liquor and men.

398
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,400
- Men?
- Don't worry about that.

399
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,520
We wouldn't be caught dead with men.

400
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,800
Rough, hairy beasts with eight hands.

401
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,000
And they all just want
one thing from a girl.

402
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,960
I beg your pardon, miss.

403
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,960
All right, girls. From the top again.

404
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,560
- Hortense, dear, good night.
- Good night, Daphne.

405
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,960
- Maude, sweet dreams.
- Good night, Daphne.

406
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,840
Good night, Gloria.

407
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,440
Dolores, you sleep tight, you hear?

408
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,840
- Nighty-night, Emily.
- Toodle-oo.

409
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,240
How about that "toodle-oo".

410
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,360
Steady, boy.
Just keep tellin' yourself you're a girl.

411
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,040
- I'm a girl.
- You're a girl.

412
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,440
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

413
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,240
I'm a...

414
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,440
Get a load of that rhyzhm section.

415
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,560
I'm a girl.

416
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,640
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

417
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,760
I'm a girl.

418
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,160
Good night, Sugar.

419
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,040
Good night, honey.

420
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,960
Honey? Hey, she called me "honey".

421
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,640
Ooh, honey.

422
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,040
- What are you doin'?
- Just makin' sure honey stays in her hive.

423
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,360
There'll be no buzzin' around tonight.

424
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,560
Supposin' I gotta go...
like for a drink of water or something.

425
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,040
- Fight it.
- Well, suppose I lose.

426
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,840
- Suppose it's an emergency.
- Pull the emergency brake.

427
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:53,160
Hey, Bienstock. You know, there's
something funny about those new girls.

428
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,840
- Funny? In what way?
- I don't know, but I can feel it right here.

429
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,560
Having an ulcer is like
having a burglar alarm go off inside you.

430
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,360
You watch your ulcers,
I'll watch those two.

431
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,560
OK, everybody go to bed.
Good night, girls.

432
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,360
- Good night, Daphne.
- Good night, Josephine.

433
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,360
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

434
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,160
I wish I were dead.

435
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:27,160
I'm a girl... I'm a girl... I'm a girl...

436
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,800
Daphne.

437
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,600
Sugar.

438
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,600
I wanted to thank you for
covering up for me. You're a real pal.

439
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,800
It's nothing.

440
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,000
I just thought that
us girls should stick together.

441
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,000
If it wasn't for you,
they'd have kicked me off the train.

442
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,080
I'd be out in the middle of nowhere,
sitting on my ukulele.

443
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,200
It's freezing outside.

444
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,200
I mean, when I think about you
and your poor ukulele...

445
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,800
If there's ever anyzhing I can do for you...

446
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,400
I can think of a million things.

447
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,280
That's one of 'em.

448
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,880
It's Sweet Sue.

449
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,200
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.

450
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,800
Oh, well, we won't tell anybody.
Not even Josephine.

451
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,880
Maybe I'd better stay here
till she goes back to sleep.

452
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,480
You stay here as long as you like.

453
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,080
I'm not crowding you, am I?

454
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
No. It's nice and cosy.

455
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,680
When I was a little girl, on cold nights
like this, I'd crawl into bed with my sister.

456
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,280
We'd cuddle up under the covers and
pretend we were lost in a dark cave

457
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,000
and were trying to find our way out.

458
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,400
Very interesting.

459
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,600
- Anyzhing wrong?
- No, no. Not a thing.

460
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,800
You poor thing. You're trembling all over.

461
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,880
That's ridiculous.

462
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,600
- Your head's hot.
- That's ridiculous.

463
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,000
- You've got cold feet.
- Isn't that ridiculous?

464
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,080
Here, let me warm them up a little.

465
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,000
- There. Isn't that better?
- Yes. I'm a girl... I'm a girl...

466
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,280
- What?
- I'm a very sick girl.

467
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,200
- I'd better go before I catch something.
- Not that sick.

468
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,200
I've got very low resistance.

469
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,000
Sugar, if you feel you're
coming down with something, my dear,

470
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,000
the best thing in the world
is a shot of whiskey.

471
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,880
- You've got some?
- I know where to get it.

472
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,480
Don't move.

473
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,400
- Hold on.
- OK.

474
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,200
Up. Up.

475
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,600
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

476
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,600
- How's the bottle?
- Half-full.

477
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
- You'd better get some cups.
- Cups?

478
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,600
Oh, I tell you, my dear,
this is the only way to travel.

479
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,320
Put on the lights.
I can't see what I'm doing.

480
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,840
No lights. We don't want them to know.

481
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,440
- But I might spill some.
- So spill it.

482
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,440
Spills, thrills, laughs and games.

483
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,120
This may even turn out
to be a surprise party.

484
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,520
- What's the surprise?
- Not yet.

485
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,040
- When?
- Better have a drink first.

486
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,120
That'll put hair on your chest.

487
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,240
No fair guessing.

488
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,440
Is this a private clambake?

489
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,440
It's private. Please, go away.

490
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,720
Dolores, do you still have that vermouth?

491
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,440
- Sure.
- Who needs vermouth?

492
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,440
We've got bourbon.
We can make Manhattans.

493
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,640
Manhattans? At this time of night?

494
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,240
- Bring the cocktail shaker.
- Oh, Sugar.

495
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,320
You're gonna spoil my surprise.

496
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,440
- Hey, honey, what's up?
- Party in upper 7.

497
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,440
- I'll get cheese and crackers.
- I'll get a shaker, you get a corkscrew.

498
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,720
Hey, Rosella, there's a party in upper 7.

499
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,640
- You got a corkscrew?
- Stella has.

500
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,240
Go get some paper cups.

501
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,840
Hey, there's a party in upper 7.

502
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,720
- Here's the vermouth.
- This is a private party. Please go away.

503
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,440
I brought some cheese and crackers.

504
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,240
- Will ten cups be enough?
- This is a party for two. Ten cups?

505
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,640
- Please, girls. Will you stop this?
- Could you use some Southern Comfort?

506
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,920
Girls, you'll wake up
the neighbours downstairs.

507
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,440
Watch that corkscrew.

508
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,520
- Here's a cracker.
- No crackers in bed.

509
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,040
Will you girls go away
and form your own party?

510
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,040
Here's the cocktail shaker.

511
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,320
- I wish we had ice.
- Easy on the vermouth.

512
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,440
13 girls in a berth is bad luck.
12 of you will have to get out.

513
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,840
- Pass me the peanut butter.
- Anyone for salami?

514
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,240
No more food.
I'll have ants in the morning.

515
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,320
Hey. Have you got any
maraschino cherries on you?

516
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,440
Never mind.

517
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,120
Maraschino cherries?

518
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,440
What's going on here?

519
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,120
Daphne. Daphne, where are you?

520
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,640
It's not my fault. I didn't invite 'em.

521
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,120
Come on, girls, break it up.

522
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,920
You heard Josephine.
Girls. Everybody out.

523
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,240
- Not you, Sugar.
- I'm going to get some ice.

524
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,320
Get out.

525
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,120
That's right, Sugar.
Now the rest of you. Out.

526
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,320
- Come on in. The water's fine.
- Have a Manhattan.

527
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,840
- Pipe down. We'll all be fired.
- Sugar. Don't leave me here alone.

528
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,440
Come on, kids. It's two o'clock.

529
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,640
You've had your fun.
The party's over. Everybody go home.

530
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,640
- What's this?
- Josephine, over here before it melts.

531
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,320
Put it here.

532
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,720
Sugar, you're gonna
get into a lot of trouble.

533
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,520
You'd better keep a lookout.

534
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,680
If Bienstock catches you again...

535
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,880
What's the matter with you, anyway?

536
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,880
I'm not very bright, I guess.

537
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,160
I wouldn't say that. Careless, maybe.

538
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,960
No, just dumb. If I had any brains, I
wouldn't be with this crummy girls' band.

539
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,880
Well, why'd you take this job?

540
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,680
I used to sing with male bands,
but I can't afford it any more.

541
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,160
Have you ever been with a male band?

542
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,680
Who, me?

543
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,280
That's what I'm running away from.

544
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,880
I worked with six in the last two years.
Oh, brother.

545
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,880
- Rough?
- I'll say.

546
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,880
- You can't trust those guys.
- I can't trust myself.

547
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,480
I have this thing about saxophone players.

548
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,480
Especially tenor sax.

549
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,760
- Really?
- I don't know why, but they curdle me.

550
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,280
All they have to do is play eight bars of
"Come To Me, My Melancholy Baby"

551
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,080
and I get goose-pimply all over,
and I come to 'em.

552
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,360
- That so?
- Every time.

553
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,080
You know, I play tenor sax.

554
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,960
But you're a girl - thank goodness.
That's why I joined this band.

555
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:21,160
Safety first. Anyzhing
to get away from those bums.

556
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,360
You don't know what they're like.
You fall for 'em.

557
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,360
You think this is gonna be
the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin.

558
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,880
The next thing you know,
they're borrowing money from you,

559
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,080
spending it on other dames
and betting on horses.

560
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,560
You don't say.

561
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,880
Then one morning you wake up,
the guy's gone, the sax's gone.

562
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,480
All that's left is a pair of old socks
and a tube of toothpaste all squeezed out.

563
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,880
You pull yourself together, you go on to
the next job, the next saxophone player.

564
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,080
It's the same thing all over again.

565
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,760
You see what I mean? Not very bright.

566
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,960
Brains aren't everyzhing.

567
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,080
I can tell you one thing. It's not
gonna happen to me again - ever.

568
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,080
I'm tired of getting
the fuzzy end of the lollipop.

569
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,080
Ice. What's keeping the ice?
The natives are getting restless.

570
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,880
- How about a couple of drinks for us?
- Sure.

571
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,280
- You know, I'm gonna be 25 in June.
- You are?

572
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,960
That's a quarter of a century.
Makes a girl think.

573
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,680
- About what?
- The future.

574
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,080
You know - like a husband. That's why
I'm glad we're going to Florida.

575
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,360
- What's in Florida?
- Millionaires. Flocks of them.

576
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,760
They all go south for the winter, like birds.

577
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,080
- Gonna catch yourself a rich bird?
- I don't care how rich he is.

578
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,160
As long as he has a yacht, a private
railroad car and his own toothpaste.

579
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,280
- You're entitled.
- Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.

580
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,080
With money like Rockefeller and
shoulders like Johnny Weissmuller.

581
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,760
- I want mine to wear glasses.
- Glasses?

582
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,680
Men who wear glasses are so much
more gentle and sweet and helpless.

583
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,880
- Haven't you ever noticed it?
- Yeah, now that you mention.

584
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,560
They get those weak eyes from reading.

585
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,080
Those long, tiny little columns
in The Wall Street Journal.

586
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,760
That bass fiddle, she sure
knows how to throw a party.

587
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,680
Hot-diggety-dog.

588
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,160
Well, happy days.

589
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:12,680
I hope this time you wind up
with the sweet end of the lollipop.

590
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,360
So the one-legged jockey said...

591
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,480
What did he say?

592
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:23,960
So the one-legged jockey said: "Don't
worry about me, baby. I ride side-saddle."

593
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,120
I'm terribly sorry. I seem to have hiccups.

594
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,520
Hey, let's rub some ice on her neck.

595
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,600
I think... Ow. You dropped it.

596
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,320
Oh, that's cold.

597
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,000
- Oh, no, please. Don't do that.
- She's ticklish.

598
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,000
Help. Please. Help. Help.

599
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,400
Josephine.

600
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,920
Please stop that. Stop that.

601
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,120
- What happened?
- Search me.

602
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,120
I mean, I'll see.

603
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,520
All right, what's goin' on around here?

604
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,520
Bienstock!

605
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,400
Are we in Florida?

606
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,120
Sugar?

607
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,520
Here. I'll carry the instruments.

608
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,000
- Thank you, Daphne.
- Thank you, Daphne.

609
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,320
Isn't she a sweetheart?

610
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,200
How do you do?

611
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,400
Zowie!

612
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,920
There they are. More millionaires
than you can shake a stick at.

613
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,920
I bet there isn't one under 75.

614
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,200
That's three quarters of a century.
Makes a girl think.

615
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,920
Let's hope they brought
their grandsons along.

616
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,520
Yes.

617
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,120
Pardon me, miss.

618
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,720
- May I?
- Help yourself.

619
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,520
I'm Osgood Fielding the Third.

620
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,600
I'm Cinderella the Second.

621
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:06,120
If there's one thing I admire,
it's a girl with a shapely ankle.

622
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,720
Me, too. Bye-bye.

623
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,200
- Let me carry one of the instruments.
- Oh, thank you.

624
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,720
Aren't you a sweetheart.

625
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,400
It certainly is delightful
having young blood around here.

626
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,920
Personally, I'm type O.

627
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,600
I've always been fascinated
by show business.

628
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,120
Is that so?

629
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,400
As a matter of fact,
it's cost my family quite a bit of money.

630
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,200
- Oh, you invest in shows?
- Showgirls.

631
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,160
- I've been married seven or eight times.
- You're not sure?

632
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,160
Mama is keeping score.

633
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,960
- She's getting annoyed with me.
- I wouldn't wonder.

634
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,760
So when George White's Scandals
opened, she packed me off to Florida.

635
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:50,440
She thinks I'm out on my yacht,
deep-sea fishing.

636
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,560
Well, pull in your reel, Mr Fielding.
You're barking up the wrong fish.

637
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,760
If I promise not to be a naughty boy,
how about dinner?

638
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,840
- I'm sorry. I'll be on the bandstand.
- Oh, of course.

639
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,440
- Which instrument do you play?
- Bull fiddle.

640
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,960
Oh, fascinating.

641
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,240
Do you use a bow, or do you just pluck it?

642
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,240
Most of the time, I slap it.

643
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,760
You must be quite a girl.

644
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,560
Wanna bet?

645
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,360
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer.
Sort of a contortionist.

646
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,760
She could smoke a cigarette
while holding it between her toes.

647
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,240
Zowie!

648
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,360
- But Mama broke it up.
- Why?

649
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,560
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.

650
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,760
- Bye-bye, Mr Fielding.
- Bye-bye?

651
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,760
- This is where I get off.
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

652
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,840
You don't get off that easy.

653
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,440
All right, driver.
Once around the park, slowly.

654
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,960
And keep your eyes on the road.

655
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,760
What kind of a girl
do you think I am, Mr Fielding?

656
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,160
- Oh, please. It won't happen again.
- I'll say.

657
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,760
- Please, come back.
- I'll walk, thank you.

658
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,840
Please, miss...

659
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,760
Zowie!

660
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,760
All right, girls. Here are
your room assignments.

661
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,560
My glasses. Where are my glasses?

662
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,640
Olga and Mary Lou are in 412.

663
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,160
And, Mary Lou, do up your kimono
when you ring for room service.

664
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,360
Josephine and Daphne are in 413.

665
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,360
- Dolores and Sugar in 414.
- Me and Sugar?

666
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,760
What did you expect?
A one-legged jockey?

667
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,440
Rosella and Emily in 415...

668
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,560
- I wish they'd put us in the same room.
- So do I.

669
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,160
But don't worry about it, Sugar.
We'll see a lot of each other.

670
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,560
414... That's the same room number
I had in Cincinnati,

671
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,760
my last time around with a male band.

672
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,640
What a heel he was.

673
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,360
- A saxophone player?
- What else? Was I ever crazy about him.

674
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,240
At two in the morning he sent me down
for hot dogs and potato salad.

675
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,040
They were out of potato salad,
so I brought coleslaw.

676
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:00,760
- So he threw it right in my face.
- Forget saxophone players.

677
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,440
You're gonna meet
a millionaire - a young one.

678
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,840
- What makes you so sure?
- My feminine intuition.

679
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,640
Oh. Are these your bags?

680
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,840
- And that one, too.
- OK, doll.

681
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:25,240
- I suppose you want a tip.
- Forget it, doll.

682
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:30,240
After all, you work here and I work here.
It's nice to have you with the organisation.

683
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,560
- Bye-bye.
- Listen, doll.

684
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,440
- What time do you get off tonight?
- Why?

685
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,640
I'm workin' the night shift and
I got a bottle of gin stashed away.

686
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:42,160
- When there's a lull...
- Aren't you a little young for that, sonny?

687
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,000
Oh, you wanna see my driver's licence?

688
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,600
- Get lost, will you?
- That's the way I like 'em - big and sassy.

689
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,600
Oh, and... get rid of your roommate.

690
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,800
- Dirty old man.
- What happened?

691
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,000
- I got pinched in the elevator.
- See how the other half lives?

692
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,600
I'm not even pretty.

693
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,800
They don't care. You're wearing a skirt.
It's like waving a red flag to a bull.

694
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,600
I'm sick of being the flag.
I wanna be a bull again.

695
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,600
- Let's blow.
- Blow where?

696
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,000
You promised me that the minute
we hit Florida we'd beat it.

697
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,600
- How can we? We're broke.
- We can find another band. A male band.

698
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:36,800
Spats Colombo is looking for us
in every male band in the country.

699
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,080
- It's humiliating.
- So you got pinched. So what?

700
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,880
Would you rather be
picking lead out of your navel?

701
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,880
But how long can we keep this up?

702
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,400
What's the beef? We're sittin' pretty.

703
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,880
Look. We get room and board.
We're getting paid every week. Look.

704
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,200
Look at the palm trees, flying fish...

705
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,480
What are you givin' me with flyin' fish?

706
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,000
I know why you wanna stay.
You're after Sugar.

707
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,880
- Me, after Sugar?
- I saw the both of you in that bus.

708
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,800
All lovey-dovey and whisperin'
and borrowin' each other's lipstick.

709
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,400
- What are you saying? Me and Sugar?
- You and Sugar.

710
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,080
- We're just like sisters.
- Well, I'm your fairy godmother.

711
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,680
And I'm gonna keep an eye on you.

712
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,880
Are you decent?

713
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,280
Come in.

714
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
You girls seen a brown bag
with a white stripe and my initials?

715
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,680
It has all my resort clothes.

716
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,200
- No, we haven't.
- I can't understand it.

717
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,880
First my glasses disappear,
then one of my suitcases.

718
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,880
- Where's my ukulele?
- Now a ukulele.

719
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,400
- There must be a sneak thief around here.
- Oh. Here it is. Hi, Sug.

720
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,200
- We're going for a swim. Coming?
- A swim. Oh, you betcha.

721
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,000
You haven't got a bathing suit.

722
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,880
I don't have one either.

723
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,800
- She doesn't have one either. You don't?
- We can rent some at the bathhouse.

724
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,280
- How about you, Josephine?
- I think I'll soak in a hot tub.

725
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,400
- On a day like this? It's lovely out.
- Yeah, well, let her soak. Come on.

726
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,680
- Don't get burned, Daphne.
- Oh, I've got suntan lotion.

727
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:09,000
See? She'll rub it on me, I'll rub it on her,
we'll rub it on each other. Bye-bye.

728
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:12,240
Daphne. Cut it out.
What do you think you're doing?

729
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,240
Just a little trick
I picked up in the elevator.

730
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,320
Ooh, look out. Here comes a big one.

731
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,240
Daphne. I had no idea
you were such a big girl.

732
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,920
You should've seen me
before I went on a diet.

733
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,040
I mean your shoulders and your arms.

734
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,320
It's carrying that bull fiddle around.

735
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,840
- There's one thing I envy you for.
- What's that?

736
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,920
You're so flat-chested.

737
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,840
Clothes hang better on you
than they do on me.

738
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,840
Watch out, Daphne.

739
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,440
Sugar, come on. Let's play ball.

740
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,520
Junior, time for your nap.

741
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,840
No. I wanna play.

742
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,120
You heard your mother, Junior. Scram!

743
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,920
This beach ain't big enough
for the both of us.

744
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,120
Mommy!

745
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,520
Here we go.

746
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:26,520
I like coffee, I like tea.

747
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,240
How many boys are stuck on me?

748
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,440
One, two, three,

749
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,720
four, five, six, seven...

750
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,320
I'm terribly sorry.
You're not hurt, are you?

751
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,720
- I don't think so.
- I wish you'd make sure.

752
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,840
Because when people find out who I am,

753
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:54,640
they hire a shyster lawyer and sue me
for three quarters of a million dollars.

754
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,120
- I won't sue you, no matter who you are.
- Thank you.

755
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,320
- Who are you?
- Now, really!

756
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,040
Sugar!

757
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,320
Come on.

758
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,640
Honestly.

759
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,640
Cheerio.

760
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,240
- Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
- Not very likely.

761
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,720
- Are you staying at the hotel?
- Not at all.

762
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,840
Your face is familiar.

763
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,440
You may have seen it
in newspapers or magazines.

764
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,240
- Vanity Fair.
- That must be it.

765
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:33,840
Would you mind moving a little?
You're blocking my view.

766
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,040
Of what?

767
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:39,120
They run up a red-and-white flag
on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.

768
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,240
You own a yacht?

769
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,040
Which one is it? The big one?

770
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,720
Certainly not.

771
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,440
With all the world unrest, nobody should
have a yacht that sleeps more than 12.

772
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,440
I quite agree.

773
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,640
Tell me, who runs up that flag?

774
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,320
- Your wife?
- No, my flag steward.

775
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,520
Who mixes the cocktails? Your wife?

776
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,680
No, my cocktail steward.

777
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,080
Look, if you're interested in
whether I am married or not...

778
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,960
- Oh, I'm not interested at all.
- Well, I'm not.

779
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,160
That's very interesting.

780
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,480
- How's the stock market?
- Up, up, up.

781
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,160
I'll bet while we were talking,
you made $100,000?

782
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,280
Could be. You play the market?

783
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,480
- No, the ukulele. And I sing, too.
- For your own amusement?

784
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,560
We are appearing at the hotel.

785
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,760
Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators.

786
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,880
- You're society girls.
- Oh, yes, quite. Bryn Mawr, Vassar...

787
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,080
We're just doing this for a lark.

788
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:39,680
Syncopators. Does that mean you play
that very fast music... jazz?

789
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,360
Yeah. Real hot.

790
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,880
I guess some like it hot.
I personally prefer classical music.

791
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,560
I do, too.

792
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,680
As a matter of fact, I spent three years
at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

793
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,480
Good school. Your family
doesn't object to your career?

794
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,880
They do indeed. Daddy threatened
to cut me off without a cent.

795
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,680
But I don't care. It was such a bore.

796
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,080
- Coming-out parties.
- Inauguration balls.

797
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,080
- Opening at the opera.
- Riding to hounds.

798
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,960
And always the same 400.

799
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,760
It's amazing we never
ran into each other before.

800
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,760
I'd have remembered
anybody as attractive as you.

801
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,480
You're very kind. I'll bet
you're also gentle and helpless.

802
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,960
I beg your pardon?

803
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,560
You see, I have a theory
about men who wear glasses.

804
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,880
- What theory?
- I'll tell you when I know you better.

805
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,560
- What are you doing tonight?
- Tonight?

806
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,560
Maybe you could come
to the hotel and hear us play.

807
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,480
- I'd like to, but that would be difficult.
- Why?

808
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:37,880
I only come ashore twice a day
when the tide goes out.

809
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,680
It's on account of these shells.
That's my hobby.

810
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,680
- You collect shells?
- So did my father and grandfather.

811
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,280
You might say we had
a passion for shells.

812
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,760
That's why we named
the oil company after it.

813
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:54,680
- Shell Oil?
- Please, no names. Just call me Junior.

814
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,880
Sugar!

815
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,360
Time to change for dinner.

816
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,680
Run along, Daphne dear.
I'll catch up with you later.

817
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,280
What, young lady?
What are you staring at?

818
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,160
Happens to me all the time.

819
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,480
I recognised him, too.
His picture was in Vanity Fair.

820
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:22,880
- Would you move along, please?
- Yes. You're in his way.

821
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,480
He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.

822
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,360
His yacht?

823
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,880
It sleeps 12. This is my friend Daphne.
She's a Vassar girl.

824
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,560
I'm a what?

825
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,680
Or was it Bryn Mawr?

826
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,480
I heard a very sad story
about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.

827
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,280
She squealed on her roommate

828
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,480
and they found her strangled
with her own brassiere.

829
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:49,480
Yes. We have to be very careful
whom we pick for a roommate. Hm?

830
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,480
Well, I think I'd better be going.

831
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,680
It was delightful meeting you both.

832
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,760
- You will come and hear us play?
- If it's at all possible.

833
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,080
Do come. It'll be such fun.

834
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,080
- And bring your yacht.
- Come on, Daphne.

835
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:12,000
- How about that guy?!
- Hands off. I saw him first.

836
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:16,800
Sugar, a little advice. If I were a girl,
and I am, I'd watch my step.

837
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,720
If I'd been watching my step,
I never would have met him.

838
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:23,520
- I can't wait to tell Josephine.
- Yeah, Josephine...

839
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,200
I can't wait to see her face.
Will she be surprised.

840
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,800
Neither can I.
Let's go tell her right now.

841
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,320
- We don't have to run.
- Oh yes, we do.

842
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,400
Josephine. Yoo-hoo.

843
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,000
- I guess she's not here.
- Isn't that funny. Josie!

844
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,000
I can't imagine where she'd be.

845
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,120
- I'll be back later.
- Oh, no. You wait.

846
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,320
I have a feeling
she'll show up any minute.

847
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:55,520
- Believe it or not, Josephine predicted it.
- Yes. This is one for Ripley.

848
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:58,520
- Do you suppose she went shopping?
- Shopping. That's it.

849
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:03,120
Something tells me she's gonna come
through that door in a brand-new outfit.

850
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:19,000
- Josephine.
- Oh. I didn't hear you come in.

851
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:30,120
- Have a good time, girls?
- The most wonderful thing happened.

852
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,800
- What?
- Guess.

853
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
- They repealed Prohibition?
- Oh, you can do better than that.

854
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,920
- I met one of them.
- One of whom?

855
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,800
Shell Oil Junior. He's got millions,
glasses and a yacht.

856
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,320
You don't say.

857
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,200
He's not only got a yacht.
He's got a bicycle.

858
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,320
Daphne.

859
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,400
Go on. Tell me all about him.

860
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,520
Well, he's young and he's handsome.
He's a bachelor.

861
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:58,120
He's a real gentleman.
You know. Not one of these grabbers.

862
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,520
Maybe you'd better go after him
if you don't want to lose him.

863
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:04,600
I'm not gonna let this one get away.
He's so cute. He collects shells.

864
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,120
Shells? Whatever for?

865
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,320
Oh, you know. The old shell game?

866
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,000
Daphne, you're bothering us.

867
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,720
- Anyway, you're gonna meet him tonight.
- I am?

868
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,920
He said he'd come
to hear us play - maybe.

869
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:21,400
What do you mean, maybe? I saw the way
he looked at you. He'll be there for sure.

870
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,920
I hope so.

871
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:26,520
What do you think, Josephine?
What does your crystal ball say?

872
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,120
Sugar. Is Sugar in here?

873
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:34,200
Sugar, you got the key? I'm locked out
and I'm makin' a puddle in the hall.

874
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,720
See you on the bandstand, girls.

875
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:43,800
What are you tryin' to do to that girl,
puttin' on a millionaire act?

876
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,920
And that phoney accent?
Nobody talks like that.

877
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,120
I've seen you pull
some low tricks on women.

878
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,920
This is without doubt
the trickiest, lowest, meanest...

879
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,920
I'm not afraid of you.

880
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,400
I'm thin, but I'm wiry.

881
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:09,400
You're gonna get hurt.
When I'm aroused, I'm a tiger.

882
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:14,120
Joe. Don't look at me like that.
It was all a joke. I didn't mean any harm.

883
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,240
I'm gonna press
the suit myself. Telephone.

884
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,640
Answer the tele...phone.

885
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,360
Hello?

886
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,640
Yes, this is 413.

887
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:32,160
Ship to shore? All right, I'll take it.

888
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,840
Daphne? It's that naughty boy again.

889
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,160
You know - Osgood? In the elevator?

890
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,840
You slapped my face?

891
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,640
- Who is this?
- This is her roommate.

892
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,960
Daphne can't talk right now. Is it urgent?

893
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:48,560
Well, it is to me.
Will you give her a message?

894
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:52,840
Tell her I'd like her to have supper with
me on my yacht after the show tonight.

895
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,040
Got it. Supper, yacht,
after the show. I'll tell her.

896
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,640
- Your yacht?
- The New Caledonia. That's its name.

897
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,160
The Old Caledonia went down
during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.

898
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:09,240
But tell her not to worry. This'll be a quiet
little midnight snack, just the two of us.

899
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,160
Just the two of you?
What about the crew?

900
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:18,160
That's all been taken care of.
I'm giving them shore leave.

901
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,640
We'll have cold pheasant
with champagne.

902
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:25,240
I've checked with the coastguard.
There's gonna be a full moon tonight.

903
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:29,560
And tell her I've got
a new batch of Rudy Vallee records.

904
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:34,360
That's good thinking.
Daphne's a pushover for him.

905
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,840
Pushover for who? What...

906
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,960
Yes, Mr Fielding.

907
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:42,760
You'll pick her up after the show
in your motorboat. Goodbye.

908
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,640
What's that you said?

909
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:49,160
- "Zowie." I'll give her the message.
- What message? What motorboat?

910
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:53,240
You got it made. Fielding wants to have
cold pheasant with you on his yacht.

911
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,960
Just the three of you on that
great big boat. You, him and Rudy Vallee.

912
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,360
Fat chance. Call him back
and say I'm not goin'.

913
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:01,160
Of course you're not.

914
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,160
I'm going.

915
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:06,640
You're gonna be on the boat
with that dirty old man?

916
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,840
I'm gonna be on the boat with Sugar.

917
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,760
- Where's he gonna be?
- He's gonna be ashore with you.

918
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,440
- With me?
- That's right.

919
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,360
Oh, no. Not tonight, Josephine.

920
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:31,440
Daphne, your boyfriend's waving at you.

921
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,520
You can both go take a flyin' jump.

922
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:36,640
Remember, he's your date
for tonight, so smile.

923
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:42,440
Oh, you can do better than that.
Give him the teeth, the whole personality.

924
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,440
Why do I let you talk me
into these things? Why?

925
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:57,240
Because we're pals. The two musketeers.

926
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:01,040
Don't give me the musketeers.
How am I gonna keep him ashore?

927
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:03,920
Tell him you get seasick.
Play miniature golf with him.

928
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:08,240
Oh, no. I'm not gonna get caught
in a miniature sand trap with that guy.

929
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,040
Hi. Which of you dolls is Daphne?

930
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,720
Bull fiddle.

931
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,040
From satchel mouth at table seven.

932
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,440
- This is from me to you, doll.
- Beat it, buster.

933
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:31,040
Never mind leaving your door open.
I got a passkey.

934
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:40,440
- What are you doin' with my flowers?
- Borrowing 'em. You'll get 'em back.

935
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:12,040
I guess he's not gonna show up.
It's five minutes to one.

936
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:15,720
- Do you suppose he forgot?
- You know how those millionaires are.

937
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,640
These came for you.

938
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,520
For me?

939
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,440
It's Shell Oil.

940
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,640
- No!
- Yes!

941
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,840
He wants to have supper
with me on his yacht.

942
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,640
He's picking me up at the pier.

943
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:30,120
- No!
- Yes.

944
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,040
You heard her - yes.

945
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:36,440
Josephine, just imagine. Me,
Sugar Kowalczyk from Sandusky, Ohio,

946
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,320
on a millionaire's yacht.

947
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:41,040
If my mother could only see me now.

948
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,520
I hope my mother never finds out.

949
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:50,120
That's it for tonight.
This is Sweet Sue saying good night,

950
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:55,440
reminding all you daddies out there
that every girl in my band is a virtuoso.

951
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:58,120
And I intend to keep it that way.

952
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,120
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

953
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,280
But it's such a waste.
A full moon, an empty yacht.

954
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,680
- I'll throw up.
- Then let's go dancing.

955
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,080
There's a roadhouse down the coast...

956
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:47,080
Well, I'll be.... He does have a bicycle.

957
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:49,080
Who?

958
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,080
About the roadhouse?

959
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:53,360
They have a Cuban band
that's the berries.

960
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:57,360
Let's go there, blindfold the orchestra
and tango till dawn.

961
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,480
- You know something, Mr Fielding?
- What?

962
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:01,480
You're dynamite.

963
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:04,360
You're a pretty hot
little firecracker yourself.

964
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:56,880
Ahoy, there.

965
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:00,080
Ahoy.

966
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:10,280
- Been waiting long?
- It's not how long you wait.

967
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:14,160
- It's who you're waiting for.
- Thank you. And for the flowers.

968
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:18,880
I wanted them to fly orchids from our
greenhouse, but Long Island is fogged in.

969
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,960
It's the thought that counts.

970
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,760
I seem to be out of gas.

971
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:33,680
It's sort of funny, you being out of gas.
I mean, Shell Oil and everyzhing.

972
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,880
Oops. There.

973
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,800
It seems to be stuck in reverse.

974
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:47,600
I just got this motorboat.
It's an an experimental model.

975
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,800
It seems like they're on the wrong track.

976
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,520
Do you mind riding backwards?
It may take a little longer.

977
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,920
It's not how long it takes.
It's who's taking you.

978
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,120
It looked so small from the beach.

979
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:26,320
But when you're on it, it's like
a cruiser or a destroyer.

980
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:31,120
It's just regulation-size. We have three.
Mother keeps hers in Southampton.

981
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,320
Daddy's is in Venezuela.
The company is laying a new pipeline.

982
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:38,200
My dad's more interested in railroads.
Baltimore and Ohio.

983
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,520
Which is the port
and which is the starboard?

984
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,320
That depends on
whether you're coming or going.

985
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:47,320
I mean, normally the aft
is on the other side of the stern.

986
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:51,920
And that's the bridge. So that you can get
from one side of the boat to the other.

987
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,600
- Would you like a glass of champagne?
- Love it. Which way?

988
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:02,120
- You have an upstairs and a downstairs.
- Yes, the hurricane cellar.

989
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:08,120
And another nice thing about
this yacht - lots of closet space.

990
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:12,400
Now, let me see. Where do you
suppose the steward set it up?

991
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,000
In here.

992
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,920
Of course. How silly of me.

993
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,520
On Thursdays they always
serve me in the small salon.

994
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,600
It's exquisite. Like a floating mansion.

995
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:36,720
It's all right for a bachelor.

996
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:41,320
- What a beautiful fish.
- I caught him off Cape Hatteras.

997
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,200
What is it?

998
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:47,120
It's a member of the herring family.

999
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,720
A herring?

1000
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:54,320
Isn't it amazing how they get those
big fish into those little glass jars?

1001
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,600
They shrink when they're marinated.

1002
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,720
- Champagne?
- I don't mind if I do.

1003
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,400
Well, down the hatch, as we say at sea.

1004
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,520
Bon voyage.

1005
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:10,000
- Look at all that silverware.
- Trophies.

1006
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:13,400
You know. Skeet shooting,
dog breeding, water polo.

1007
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,520
Isn't water polo terribly dangerous?

1008
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:18,120
I'll say. I had two ponies
drowned under me.

1009
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,200
Where's your shell collection?

1010
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,720
Yes, of course.
Where could they have put it?

1011
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:25,400
You see, on Thursdays
I'm sort of lost around here.

1012
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,400
- What's on Thursdays?
- It's the crew's night off.

1013
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,720
- You mean we're alone on the boat?
- Completely.

1014
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:35,400
I've never been completely alone
with a man in the middle of the night,

1015
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,120
- in the middle of the ocean.
- Oh, it's perfectly safe.

1016
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:41,000
We're anchored.
The ship's in shipshape shape.

1017
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,720
The coastguard will call
if any icebergs appear.

1018
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,720
It's not the icebergs.

1019
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:49,000
But certain men would try to
take advantage of a situation like this.

1020
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:52,840
- You're flattering me.
- Of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.

1021
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,360
It's not that. It's just that I'm harmless.

1022
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:00,040
- Harmless? How?
- I don't know how to put it,

1023
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,360
but I've got this thing about girls.

1024
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:05,840
- What thing?
- They just sort of leave me cold.

1025
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:07,760
You mean, like, frigid?

1026
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:10,240
Well, it's more like a mental block.

1027
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:13,760
When I'm with a girl,
it does absolutely nothing to me.

1028
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:18,160
- Have you tried?
- Have I. I'm trying all the time.

1029
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,240
See? Nothing.

1030
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,840
- Nothing at all?
- Complete washout.

1031
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:33,040
- That makes me feel just awful.
- My dear, it's not your fault.

1032
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:36,040
Now and then Mother Nature
throws somebody a dirty curve.

1033
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:38,160
Something goes wrong inside.

1034
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:41,160
- You mean you can't fall in love?
- Not any more.

1035
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,960
I was in love once,
but I'd rather not talk about it.

1036
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,960
- Would you like a little cold pheasant?
- What happened?

1037
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:50,240
- I don't want to bore you.
- You couldn't possibly.

1038
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,360
Well...

1039
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:54,560
It was my freshman year at Princeton.

1040
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,960
There was this girl. Her name was Nellie.

1041
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,640
Her father was
the vice president of Hupmobile.

1042
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,160
She wore glasses, too.

1043
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,760
That summer we were
at the Grand Canyon.

1044
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:07,640
We were on the highest ledge
watching the sunset,

1045
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:10,160
when suddenly we got
this impulse to kiss.

1046
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:13,560
I took off my glasses.
She took off her glasses.

1047
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,640
I took a step toward her.

1048
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,640
She took a step toward me.

1049
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:22,960
Yes. Eight hours later
they brought her up by mule.

1050
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:26,960
I gave her three transfusions.
We had the same type blood - type O.

1051
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,840
But it was too late.

1052
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:31,760
Talk about sad.

1053
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,840
Ever since then,

1054
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:37,360
numb, no feelings, like my heart
was shot full of Novocain.

1055
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,760
You poor, poor boy.

1056
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,640
Yes. All the money in the world,
and what good is it?

1057
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,560
Mint sauce or cranberries?

1058
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:48,240
How can you think about food
at a time like this?

1059
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:50,360
What else is there for me?

1060
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:53,960
- Is it that hopeless?
- My family did everyzhing they could.

1061
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:56,640
Hired the most beautiful
French upstairs maids.

1062
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:59,840
Got a special tutor to read me
books that were banned in Boston.

1063
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,040
Imported a troupe of Balinese dancers

1064
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:05,360
with those bells on their ankles
and long fingernails.

1065
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,760
What a waste of money.

1066
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,160
Have you ever tried American girls?

1067
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:11,960
Why?

1068
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,440
Was that anyzhing?

1069
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:22,440
Thanks just the same.

1070
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,360
You should see a doctor - a good doctor.

1071
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:29,960
I have. I spent six months in Vienna
with Professor Freud, flat on my back.

1072
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:35,560
Then there were the Mayo brothers,
injections, hypnosis, mineral baths.

1073
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,040
If I wasn't such a coward, I'd kill myself.

1074
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,360
Don't say that.

1075
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:44,160
There must be some girl
someplace that could...

1076
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:48,360
If I ever found a girl that could,
I'd marry her just like that.

1077
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:52,040
- Would you do me a favour?
- Certainly. What is it?

1078
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:55,960
I may not be Dr Freud or a Mayo brother
or one of those French upstairs girls,

1079
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,680
but could I take another crack at it?

1080
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:01,880
All right, if you insist.

1081
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:18,280
- Anyzhing this time?
- I'm afraid not.

1082
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,680
- Terribly sorry.
- Would you like some more champagne?

1083
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:27,680
Maybe if we had some music.
How do you dim these lights?

1084
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,280
Look, it's terribly sweet of you
to want to help out, but it's no use.

1085
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,600
I think the light switch is over there.

1086
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,080
That's the radio.

1087
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:45,600
It's like taking someone
to a concert when he's tone-deaf.

1088
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,800
You're not giving yourself a chance.

1089
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:25,600
Don't fight it.

1090
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,080
Relax.

1091
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,000
It's like smoking without inhaling.

1092
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:45,080
So inhale.

1093
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:08,600
Daphne,

1094
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:11,000
- you're leading again.
- Sorry.

1095
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,200
Well?

1096
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,680
I'm not quite sure.

1097
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,080
Would you try it again?

1098
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:45,000
I got a funny sensation in my toes.

1099
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:48,880
Like someone was barbecuing them
over a slow flame.

1100
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:52,880
Let's throw another log on the fire.

1101
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:04,640
I think you're on the right track.

1102
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:08,720
I must be. Your glasses
are beginning to steam up.

1103
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,840
I never knew it could be like this.

1104
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:38,120
Thank you.

1105
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:41,320
They told me I was kaput,
finished, all washed up.

1106
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:45,040
And here you are, making a chump
out of all those experts.

1107
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,840
Mineral baths. Now, really.

1108
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:53,240
Where did you learn to kiss like that?

1109
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:56,520
I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.

1110
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:10,720
Tomorrow, remind me to send
a cheque for $100,000 to the Milk Fund.

1111
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:14,720
Whoops.

1112
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,320
- Good night.
- Good morning.

1113
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,440
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?

1114
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:49,040
$850,000.

1115
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:51,720
Let's make it an even million.

1116
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,160
I forgot to give you a receipt.

1117
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,960
Hi, Jerry. Everyzhing under control?

1118
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,680
Have I got things to tell you.

1119
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:02,080
- What happened?
- I'm engaged.

1120
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:05,480
Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl?

1121
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:07,160
I am.

1122
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,960
What?

1123
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:16,280
Osgood proposed to me.
We're planning a June wedding.

1124
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:21,560
What are you talking about?
You can't marry Osgood.

1125
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:26,280
- Do you think he's too old for me?
- Jerry, you can't be serious.

1126
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:28,960
Why not? He keeps
marryin' girls all the time.

1127
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:32,480
But... you're not a girl. You're a guy.

1128
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,480
And why would a guy
wanna marry a guy?

1129
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:36,480
Security.

1130
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,880
- Jerry, lie down. You're not well.
- Stop treatin' me like a child.

1131
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:44,080
- I'm not stupid. I know there's a problem.
- I'll say there is.

1132
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:48,680
His mother. We need her approval. But
I'm not worried because I don't smoke.

1133
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:54,880
- Jerry, there's another problem.
- Like what?

1134
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:58,760
- Like your honeymoon.
- We've been discussing that.

1135
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:02,880
He wants to go to the Riviera,
but I kinda lean towards Niagara Falls.

1136
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:09,480
Jerry, you're outta your mind.
You can't get away with this.

1137
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:13,360
I don't expect it to last.
I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.

1138
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:16,080
- Like when?
- Like right after the ceremony.

1139
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:19,480
Then we get a quick annulment,
he makes a nice settlement on me

1140
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:22,680
and I keep gettin' those
alimony cheques every month.

1141
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,880
Jerry, listen to me.

1142
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,160
There are laws, conventions.
It's just not been done.

1143
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,880
Joe, this may be my last chance
to marry a millionaire.

1144
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:39,880
Jerry, will you take my advice?
Forget about the whole thing, will you?

1145
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:43,680
Just keep telling yourself you're a boy.

1146
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:46,880
- I'm a boy.
- That's the boy.

1147
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:50,280
I'm a boy, I'm a boy, I'm a...

1148
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:54,080
I wish I were dead.
I'm a boy. Boy, oh boy, am I a boy.

1149
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:56,480
What about my engagement present?

1150
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,880
- What engagement present?
- Osgood gave me a bracelet.

1151
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:03,160
Hey, these are real diamonds.

1152
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,880
Of course they're real.
You think my fianc? is a bum?

1153
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:10,360
- I guess I'll have to give it back to him.
- Wait a minute, Jerry. Let's not be hasty.

1154
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:13,880
After all, we don't wanna
hurt Osgood's feelings.

1155
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:19,280
- Just a minute.
- It's me. Sugar.

1156
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,200
Come in.

1157
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:32,800
I thought I heard voices. I had to talk to
somebody. I don't feel like going to sleep.

1158
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:36,600
- What you need is a slug of bourbon.
- Oh, no. I'm off that stuff for good.

1159
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:40,720
- Did you have a nice time?
- Nice?

1160
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,800
It was suicidally beautiful.

1161
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,120
Did he get fresh?

1162
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:48,520
Of course not. As a matter of fact,
it was just the other way around.

1163
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:50,800
- You see, he needs help.
- What for?

1164
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,600
Talk about elegant.
You should see the yacht.

1165
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:57,120
Candlelight, mint sauce and cranberries.

1166
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,800
Gee, I wish I'd been there.

1167
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,200
I'm going to see him again
tonight - and every night.

1168
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,120
I think he's going to propose.

1169
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:06,920
- As soon as he gets up his nerve.
- That's some nerve.

1170
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,120
Daphne got a proposal tonight.

1171
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,200
- Really?
- From a rich millionaire.

1172
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,120
That's wonderful.

1173
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:16,400
- Poor Josephine.
- Me?

1174
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,200
Well, Daphne has a beau, I have a beau...

1175
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,920
If we could only find somebody for you.

1176
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,120
Here I am, doll.

1177
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:53,600
"Friends of Italian Opera" - that's us.

1178
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:55,920
Register over there.

1179
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,720
Spats Colombo. Delegate from Chicago.
South Side Chapter.

1180
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:10,720
Thanks.

1181
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,320
Hiya, Spats.

1182
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:15,400
- We was layin' 8-1 you wouldn't show.
- Why wouldn't I?

1183
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:18,520
We thought you was all broken up
about Toothpick Charlie.

1184
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:22,800
- We all gotta go sometime.
- Yeah. You never know who's next.

1185
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,200
OK, Spats. Report to the sergeant at arms.

1186
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:28,920
- What for?
- Orders from Little Bonaparte.

1187
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:36,120
- All right, Spats, get your hands up.
- What's the idea?

1188
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:39,120
Little Bonaparte don't want
no hardware around.

1189
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,320
All right, you're clean.

1190
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,520
You're not.

1191
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,600
It ain't loaded.

1192
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:06,000
Next. What's in here?

1193
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:09,400
My golf clubs. Putter, niblick, No.3 iron.

1194
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,720
- What's this?
- My mashie.

1195
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,920
See you at the banquet, Spats.

1196
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:23,920
Where did you pick up that cheap trick?

1197
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:26,400
Come on, boys.

1198
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:29,360
Well. Spats Colombo, if I ever saw one.

1199
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:31,640
Hello, copper.
What brings you to Florida?

1200
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,760
I heard you opera-lovers were meetin'.

1201
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:36,760
Thought I'd come in case
anybody decided to sing.

1202
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:38,040
Big joke.

1203
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:40,440
Where were you at 3pm
on St Valentine's Day?

1204
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:43,440
- I was at Rigoletto.
- What's his first name and address?

1205
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:45,560
It's an opera, you ignoramus.

1206
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:48,840
- In the garage on Clark Street?
- Clark Street? Never heard of it.

1207
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:52,360
Ever hear of Deluxe Cleaners
on Wabash Avenue?

1208
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:55,560
The day after the shoot
you sent in spats with blood on 'em.

1209
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:57,360
I cut myself while shaving.

1210
01:32:57,560 --> 01:33:00,160
- You shave with spats on?
- I sleep with my spats on.

1211
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:03,560
Stop kidding. You vulcanised
Toothpick Charlie, and we know it.

1212
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:04,840
You and who else?

1213
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:08,760
Me and those two witnesses you
have been lookin' for all over Chicago.

1214
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,640
Boys, know anyzhing about
any garage or witnesses?

1215
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:14,360
Us? We was with you at Rigoletto's.

1216
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:16,640
Honest.

1217
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:22,160
Don't worry, Spats. One of these days
we're gonna dig up those two guys.

1218
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:24,640
That's what you'll have to do - dig 'em up.

1219
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:38,160
I feel like such a tramp, taking jewellery
from a man under false pretences.

1220
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:41,840
Get it while you're young. Fix your lips
if you wanna look nice for Osgood.

1221
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:44,440
It'll break his heart when
he finds out I can't marry him.

1222
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:47,760
It'll break Sugar's heart when
she finds out I'm not a millionaire.

1223
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:50,240
Can't make an omelette
without breakin' an egg.

1224
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:52,560
- What's with the omelette?
- Nag, nag, nag.

1225
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:57,240
We got a yacht, a bracelet, you've got
Osgood, I've got Sugar. We'll be cookin'.

1226
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:03,040
- Joe!
- What?

1227
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:07,960
Something tells me the omelette
is about to hit the fan.

1228
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:12,040
Come on, Daphne.

1229
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:18,040
- Going up.
- Hold it.

1230
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,560
Three, please.

1231
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:39,960
I don't mean to be forward,

1232
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:43,040
but ain't I had the pleasure
of meetin' you two broads before?

1233
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:45,640
- Oh, no.
- You must mean two other broads.

1234
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:48,960
- You ever been in Chicago?
- Us?

1235
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:51,360
We wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago.

1236
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:52,760
Third floor.

1237
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:55,840
- What floor are you on, sweetie?
- Never you mind.

1238
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,840
Room 413. We'll be in touch.

1239
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,640
Don't call us. We'll call you.

1240
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,360
I tell you, Joe, they're onto us.

1241
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:18,760
They're gonna line us up
against the wall and...

1242
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:21,960
The cops will find two dead dames
and take us to the morgue

1243
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:24,160
and when they undress us,
I'll die of shame.

1244
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:27,240
- Shut up and keep packing.
- Yeah. OK, Joe.

1245
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,440
- Not that, you idiot.
- They're from Osgood.

1246
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:31,640
He wanted me to wear 'em tonight.

1247
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:38,160
I tell you, I will never find
another man who's so good to me.

1248
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:42,800
Joe, if we get outta this hotel alive,
we'll sell this bracelet, take the money,

1249
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:45,880
grab a boat to South America
and hide out in a banana republic.

1250
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:49,800
I figured if we eat nothing but bananas,
we could live there for 50 years.

1251
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:51,680
If we get outta the hotel alive.

1252
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:54,600
- Did we forget anyzhing?
- Yeah. The shaving stuff.

1253
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:56,880
- And also Sugar.
- Sugar?

1254
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:59,000
- Give me room 414.
- What are you doin'?

1255
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:01,400
- Making a telephone call.
- Who has time?

1256
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:03,600
We can't walk out on her
without a goodbye.

1257
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:06,600
You usually walk out and leave 'em
with a kick in the teeth.

1258
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:10,000
That's when I was a saxophone player.
Now I'm a millionaire.

1259
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:13,400
Mail her a postcard.
Those gorillas may be here any minute.

1260
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:16,080
Room 414?
This is the ship-to-shore operator.

1261
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:17,800
Ship to shore?

1262
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:20,200
Hey, Sugar, it's for you. From the yacht.

1263
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,800
Hello, my dearest darling.
It's good to hear your voice.

1264
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:31,200
I may throw up.

1265
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:36,480
No, I didn't sleep too well, darling.
To tell the truth, I never closed an eye.

1266
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:40,280
I never slept better.
I had the most wonderful dream.

1267
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,680
I was still on the yacht
and the anchor broke loose.

1268
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:45,400
We drifted for days and days.

1269
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,280
You were the captain and I was the crew.

1270
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:52,080
I kept a lookout for icebergs, I sorted
your shells and mixed your cocktails,

1271
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:54,880
and I wiped the steam off your glasses.

1272
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,800
And when I woke up, I wanted
to swim right back to you.

1273
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,400
Yes...

1274
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:03,680
Now, about our date for tonight...

1275
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:06,600
I'll meet you on the pier again
right after the show.

1276
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:10,600
I'm afraid not. I can't make it tonight.

1277
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:14,800
Not tomorrow either. I have to leave.

1278
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:18,480
Something unexpected came up.
I'm sailing right away.

1279
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:20,680
Where to?

1280
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:23,400
South America?

1281
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:26,080
That is unexpected.

1282
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:29,600
You see, we have
these oil interests in Venezuela.

1283
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:33,600
I just got a cable from Dad. The board
of directors have decided on a merger.

1284
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:36,600
A merger? How long will you be gone?

1285
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:40,480
Quite a while.

1286
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:43,480
As a matter of fact,
I'm not coming back at all.

1287
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,600
You're not?

1288
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,200
Well, it's all rather complicated.
What we call high finance.

1289
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:53,880
It just so happens the president of the
Venezuelan oil syndicate has a daughter...

1290
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,200
Oh. That kind of merger.

1291
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:59,200
What is she like?

1292
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,880
According to our tax adviser,
she's only so-so.

1293
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:03,800
But that's the way the oil gushes.

1294
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:07,400
A man in my position
has a responsibility to the stockholders.

1295
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:11,000
All those little people
who have invested their life savings.

1296
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:14,800
Of course. I understand.
At least, I think I do.

1297
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:20,600
I knew you would. I only wish there
was something I could do for you.

1298
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:24,080
But you have. You've given me
all that inside information.

1299
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:26,080
Tomorrow I'm gonna call my broker

1300
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:29,280
and have him buy me
50,000 shares of Venezuelan oil.

1301
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:31,400
Smart move.

1302
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,400
By the way, did you get my flowers?

1303
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:36,800
You know, those orchids
from my greenhouse?

1304
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:41,000
The fog finally lifted over Long Island
and they flew them down this morning.

1305
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:44,680
That's strange. I sent 'em to your room.

1306
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:48,640
They should have been delivered by now.

1307
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:55,640
Hey, Dolores, will you see
if there's any flowers outside?

1308
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:04,040
Yes, they're here. White orchids.

1309
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:07,040
I haven't had white orchids
since I was a debutante.

1310
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:10,840
What's this?

1311
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:13,320
What's what?

1312
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:16,040
Oh, that. Just a little going-away present.

1313
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:19,640
Real diamonds.

1314
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:24,040
They must be worth their weight in gold.
Are you always this generous?

1315
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:26,840
Not always.

1316
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:29,840
I wanted you to know how grateful
I am for what you did for me.

1317
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:33,120
I didn't do anyzhing. It just happened.

1318
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:38,440
The navigator just came in.
We're ready to cast off.

1319
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:41,840
Well, anchors aweigh,
and have a bon voyage.

1320
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:44,240
If you need an orchestra
to play at your wedding,

1321
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:46,320
we'll be through here
in a couple of weeks.

1322
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,840
Goodbye, my darling.

1323
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:52,240
I don't know about the captain but
the navigator's gettin' his tail outta here.

1324
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:55,440
- Yeah, let's shove off.
- Wait a minute. My bracelet.

1325
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,520
What happened to my bracelet?

1326
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:03,520
- Your bracelet? It's ours.
- All right. What happened to our bracelet?

1327
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:07,840
- We did the right thing with it.
- You're not pullin' one of your old tricks.

1328
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:10,240
No tricks, no mirrors,
nothing up my sleeve.

1329
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,840
It's on the level this time.

1330
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:20,640
Where's that bourbon?

1331
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:30,920
- What's the matter, Sugar?
- I don't know. All of a sudden I'm thirsty.

1332
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:33,840
How did you get that bracelet?

1333
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:35,720
- You like it?
- I always did.

1334
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:40,520
Junior gave it to me. He's gone
to South America to marry another girl.

1335
01:40:40,640 --> 01:40:43,640
- That's what you call high finance.
- That's what I call a louse.

1336
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:47,240
If I were you, I'd take that bracelet
and throw it back in his face.

1337
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:51,920
He's the first nice guy I've met in my life.
The only one that ever gave me anyzhing.

1338
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:54,440
You'll forget him, Sugar.

1339
01:40:55,240 --> 01:41:00,040
How can I? No matter where I go, there'll
always be a Shell station on every corner.

1340
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:03,320
I'll bring this back when it's empty.

1341
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:08,520
Are you crazy? The place
is crawlin' with mobsters.

1342
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:11,720
And you're makin' like
Diamond Jim Brady.

1343
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:13,920
How are we gonna get outta here?
How are we gonna eat?

1344
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:17,920
- We'll walk. If we have to, we'll starve.
- There's that "we" again.

1345
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:21,240
Not that way. We don't wanna
run into Spats and his chums.

1346
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:31,720
Your hands clean?

1347
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,240
Over.

1348
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:35,240
OK, button my spats.

1349
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:40,040
You sure dress nice, boss.

1350
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:43,120
Say, boss. I've been talking
with the other delegates.

1351
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:47,440
The word is, Little Bonaparte is real sore
over what happened to Toothpick Charlie.

1352
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:51,240
- Him and Charlie was choirboys together.
- Stop or I'll bust out cryin'.

1353
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:54,880
He even got Charlie's last toothpick
from the garage. Had it gold-plated.

1354
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:56,960
Like I was tellin' you fellas.

1355
01:41:57,160 --> 01:42:00,280
Little Bonaparte's gettin' soft.
Hasn't got it here any more.

1356
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:02,680
Used to be like a rock.

1357
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:07,360
- It's too bad. I think it's time he retired.
- Second the motion.

1358
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:09,280
How are we gonna retire him?

1359
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:11,360
Oh, we'll think of somethin' cute.

1360
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:15,480
Little Bonaparte and Toothpick Charlie
will be singin' in the same choir again.

1361
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:21,960
But this time we'll make sure
there are no witnesses.

1362
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:28,080
Look. The two broads from the elevator.

1363
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:33,080
Hey. Join us.

1364
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:36,480
What's the matter with those dames?

1365
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:38,760
Maybe those dames ain't dames.

1366
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:43,960
Same faces, same instruments.

1367
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:50,960
- Here's your Valentine's card.
- The two musicians from the garage.

1368
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:55,760
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago,
so we'll finish the job here. Come on.

1369
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:17,880
- All right, so what do we do now?
- First we gotta get out of these clothes.

1370
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:53,680
What happened?

1371
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:57,080
Me and Tiny had them cornered,
but we lost them in the shuffle.

1372
01:44:57,280 --> 01:45:00,360
- Where were you guys?
- We was with you, at Rigoletto's.

1373
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:04,000
- Why, you stupid idiot.
- Boss, we'll get 'em after the banquet.

1374
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:06,520
They can't be too far away.

1375
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:26,800
Thank you.

1376
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:29,120
Thank you, fellow opera-lovers.

1377
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:34,320
It's been ten years since I elected myself
president of this organisation,

1378
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:38,320
and, if I say so myself,
you made the right choice.

1379
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,600
Let's look at the record.
In the last fiscal year,

1380
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:47,720
we made $112 million before taxes.

1381
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:50,720
Only we ain't payin' no taxes.

1382
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:56,000
Of course, like in every business,
we had our little misunderstandings.

1383
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:59,920
Let us now observe one minute of silence

1384
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:04,320
in memory of seven of our members
from Chicago, North Side Chapter,

1385
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:08,920
who are unable to be with us tonight
on account of bein' rubbed out.

1386
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:15,200
You too, Spats.

1387
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:17,320
Up.

1388
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:28,120
Easy, now.

1389
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:31,400
- You know when you come out?
- Yeah. Second time they sing:

1390
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:35,520
For he's a jolly good fellow
which nobody can deny.

1391
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:37,520
OK.

1392
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:45,320
And don't mess up the cake. I promised
to bring back a piece to my kids.

1393
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:54,720
Now, fellow delegates,

1394
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:58,320
there comes a time in the life
of every business executive

1395
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:01,120
when he starts thinkin' about retirement.

1396
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:03,120
No!

1397
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:08,600
I'm lookin' around
for somebody to fill my shoes.

1398
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:11,720
I've been considerin' several candidates.

1399
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:15,000
For instance, there's
a certain party from Chicago,

1400
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:17,200
South Side Chapter.

1401
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:24,720
Now, some people say
he's gotten a little too big for his spats.

1402
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:28,400
But I say he's a man who'll go far.

1403
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:32,520
Some people say he's gone too far.

1404
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:36,120
But I say,
you can't keep a good man down.

1405
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:39,320
Of course, he's still got a lot to learn.

1406
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:41,920
The big noise he made
on St Valentine's Day,

1407
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,200
that wasn't very good for public relations.

1408
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:50,920
And lettin' them two witnesses get away.
That sure was careless.

1409
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,920
Don't worry about those two.
They're as good as dead.

1410
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,120
I almost caught up with them today.

1411
01:47:56,200 --> 01:48:00,120
You mean you let 'em get away twice?

1412
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:03,320
Some people would say
that's real sloppy.

1413
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:07,400
But I say: to err is human,
to forgive divine.

1414
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:09,800
And just to show you
what I think of you, Spats,

1415
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:12,360
the boys told me
you was gonna have a birthday.

1416
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:14,440
So we baked you a little cake.

1417
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:17,040
My birthday?

1418
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:19,560
Why, it ain't for another four months.

1419
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:23,360
So we're a little early.
What's a few months between friends?

1420
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:25,760
All right, boys. Now all together.

1421
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:28,160
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1422
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:30,560
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1423
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:34,360
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1424
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:36,840
Which nobody can deny.

1425
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:38,840
Which nobody can deny.

1426
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:41,560
Which nobody can deny.

1427
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:44,040
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1428
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:46,160
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1429
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:49,440
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1430
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:53,040
Which nobody can deny.

1431
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,760
Big joke.

1432
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:18,360
Let's get outta here.

1433
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:23,560
Get those two guys.

1434
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:31,840
What happened here?

1435
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:36,040
There was somethin' in that cake
that didn't agree with 'em.

1436
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:41,440
My compliments to the chef. Nobody
leaves this room till I get the recipe.

1437
01:49:41,640 --> 01:49:44,040
You wanna make a federal case of it?

1438
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:50,160
Yeah.

1439
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:18,160
They slipped through our hands.

1440
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:22,160
We're watchin' the train station, roads
and airport. They can't get away.

1441
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:25,160
- Did you hear that?
- But they're not watching yachts.

1442
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:28,160
- You're gonna call Osgood.
- What'll I tell him?

1443
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:30,840
Tell him you're gonna elope with him.

1444
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:33,360
Elope? But there are laws, conventions.

1445
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:37,160
There's a convention, all right.
There's also the ladies' morgue.

1446
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:35,880
Josephine.

1447
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:39,880
Bienstock!

1448
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:42,680
Hey. That's no dame.

1449
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:45,280
None of that, Sugar.

1450
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:47,400
No guy is worth it.

1451
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:52,400
Grab her.

1452
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,880
Josephine?

1453
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:06,400
- Osgood's meeting us at the pier.
- We're not on the pier yet.

1454
01:53:55,080 --> 01:53:56,400
Hi.

1455
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:59,000
My friend Josephine,
gonna be a bridesmaid.

1456
01:53:59,080 --> 01:54:01,080
- Pleased to meet you.
- Come on.

1457
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:03,000
She's so eager.

1458
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:18,400
Wait for Sugar!

1459
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:25,840
- Another bridesmaid?
- Flower girl.

1460
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,120
- Sugar, what are you doing?
- I told you, I'm not very bright.

1461
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:31,240
Let's go.

1462
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:35,640
You don't want me, Sugar.

1463
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:38,240
I'm a liar and a phoney.
A saxophone player.

1464
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:40,640
One of those no-goodniks
you keep running away from.

1465
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:42,120
I know. Every time.

1466
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:45,240
Sugar, do yourself a favour.
Go back to the millionaires.

1467
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:46,920
The sweet end of the lollipop,

1468
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:50,840
not the coleslaw in the face
and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste.

1469
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:53,920
That's right, pour it on. Talk me out of it.

1470
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:00,640
I called Mama.
She was so happy, she cried.

1471
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:03,720
She wants you to have
her wedding gown. It's white lace.

1472
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:06,840
Osgood, I can't get married
in your mother's dress.

1473
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:11,240
She and I, we are not built the same way.

1474
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:13,920
- We can have it altered.
- Oh no, you don't.

1475
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:18,240
Osgood, I'm gonna level with you.
We can't get married at all.

1476
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:19,720
Why not?

1477
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:21,240
Well...

1478
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:23,840
In the first place, I'm not a natural blonde.

1479
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:25,520
Doesn't matter.

1480
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:27,920
I smoke. I smoke all the time.

1481
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:29,640
I don't care.

1482
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:33,840
I have a terrible past. For three years
I've been living with a saxophone player.

1483
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:35,840
I forgive you.

1484
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:40,040
I can never have children.

1485
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:43,440
- We can adopt some.
- You don't understand, Osgood.

1486
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:47,520
- I'm a man.
- Well,

1487
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:50,040
nobody's perfect.
