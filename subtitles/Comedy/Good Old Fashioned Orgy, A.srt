1
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,685
Sue, no, no, no!

2
00:02:00,814 --> 00:02:03,227
Kill yourself on your own time.

3
00:02:39,797 --> 00:02:42,169
According to the Art of War by Sun Tzu,

4
00:02:42,397 --> 00:02:45,435
every battle is won and lost before it is fought.

5
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:47,519
Well, then I guess you've already lost.

6
00:02:50,897 --> 00:02:54,185
Oh, that's not very sportsmanlike.
Let's fucking go!

7
00:03:20,314 --> 00:03:23,144
Ladies.
Hi again.

8
00:03:23,172 --> 00:03:25,002
Ok, this is the third time we've been out here.

9
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:25,720
I know.

10
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,620
We're shutting this party down.

11
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,339
You don't wanna shut the party down.
You wanna join us.

12
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:29,885
Alright?

13
00:03:29,814 --> 00:03:31,479
So why don't you put the guns back in the car

14
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,144
and you come on in, and having good times?

15
00:03:33,272 --> 00:03:34,395
Hey, Bill.

16
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:35,519
Sorry I'm late, buddy.

17
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:36,603
Fucking Map Quest.

18
00:03:36,603 --> 00:03:37,560
I know it, bro.

19
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:40,435
I'm right with you with that shit.
Hey look, guys.

20
00:03:40,564 --> 00:03:44,060
Is this about earlier? When you first came on,
and I thought you were strippers?

21
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:45,854
Because that was an accident.

22
00:03:45,854 --> 00:03:47,519
Alright? You're just very attractive.

23
00:03:47,647 --> 00:03:48,977
Those uniforms are banging.

24
00:03:49,106 --> 00:03:52,435
Seriously, if we have to come out here again,
it's a $1000 fine.

25
00:03:52,564 --> 00:03:53,583
Close it down.

26
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,602
Okay.

27
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:55,977
Message received.

28
00:03:56,106 --> 00:03:57,477
It's done.
You have my word.

29
00:03:57,606 --> 00:04:00,106
I'm gonna go inside,
get on the mike, shut it down.

30
00:04:17,064 --> 00:04:19,602
I don't understand why you won't just put it on.

31
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:21,852
Because I don't find the notion of mocking

32
00:04:22,022 --> 00:04:24,769
the American underclass as amusing as your friends do,

33
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:27,602
and partly because I don't share your desperate need to fit in.

34
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:30,685
By not putting the wig on,
you are deliberately setting yourself

35
00:04:30,814 --> 00:04:32,227
and me apart from my friends,

36
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:35,185
which is a controlling and hostile gesture.

37
00:04:35,314 --> 00:04:36,769
Fine.

38
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:41,370
Happy now?

39
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,894
Yes!

40
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:42,987
Now I'm Mr. Fun Times.

41
00:04:42,637 --> 00:04:44,437
I'm very happy about that. Thank you.

42
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:45,563
I'm going for a smoke.

43
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:48,086
Good, because it's.. it's a fucking costume party.

44
00:04:51,144 --> 00:04:53,646
Do we need to talk quietly around her?

45
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:56,230
Oh, no, no, no.
She sleeps through anything.

46
00:04:56,352 --> 00:04:57,813
Yes, you do.

47
00:04:57,977 --> 00:05:02,230
When the babysitter bailed, Glenn and I were like,
'Fuck it.' We have missed every party.

48
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:04,396
No way we're missing the White Trash Bash.

49
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:08,105
Give it up for Glenn.
Glenn's getting married soon.

50
00:05:08,227 --> 00:05:10,521
I really did it.

51
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,313
What's the deal with your bachelorette weekend?

52
00:05:14,136 --> 00:05:14,845
Yeah!

53
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:15,855
Ok, I think it's gonna be

54
00:05:15,977 --> 00:05:17,896
more of a bachelorette night.

55
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:21,930
And it's gonna be at my folks' place in Jersey.

56
00:05:22,394 --> 00:05:23,625
Oh.

57
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:24,625
Sorry.

58
00:05:24,877 --> 00:05:27,338
No! That's gonna be fine.
That's totally fine.

59
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:28,855
Has anyone seen Glenn?

60
00:05:28,977 --> 00:05:31,605
Human torpedo!

61
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:45,896
It's okay.
He's a doctor.

62
00:05:50,311 --> 00:05:52,188
Hey, buttheads,
you guys seen Duquez?

63
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:54,230
Will you relax with the doughnuts?

64
00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:58,480
Oh, sweetie, I want to. Look, I'm trying to push
the savory on this people and all they want is the sweet.

65
00:05:58,602 --> 00:05:59,896
I promise you no one cares.

66
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:02,313
Hey.
Where the fuck are the doughnuts?

67
00:06:02,686 --> 00:06:03,813
Except him.

68
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:06,230
Guess what. D.Duquez is AWOL.

69
00:06:06,352 --> 00:06:07,052
That is unacceptable.

70
00:06:07,052 --> 00:06:09,513
This fucking behaviour is unacceptable.
I got have it out with that guy.

71
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,646
Like the doughnut police.

72
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:14,313
Hey, get off of that thing.
It's Saturday night.

73
00:06:14,436 --> 00:06:17,980
Well, it's Sunday in Korea,
and those motherfuckers don't stop working.

74
00:06:18,102 --> 00:06:20,396
Honestly, they make the Japanese look like Jamaicans.

75
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,103
Is that the new Blackberry?

76
00:06:22,103 --> 00:06:23,688
Yes, it is new Blackberry. Got it at the office.

77
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:26,980
You know what? As punishment for not dressing up,
I'm putting this down my pants.

78
00:06:27,102 --> 00:06:29,063
No, no, no!
Just don't do that!

79
00:06:29,186 --> 00:06:30,688
My dick's checking your e-mail.

80
00:06:30,811 --> 00:06:31,311
I'm sending a text.

81
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:32,011
No, just don't do that!

82
00:06:32,644 --> 00:06:35,480
You have my life in your pants.
You cocksucker.

83
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,563
Hey, you two,
get a room or get a video camera.

84
00:06:48,852 --> 00:06:50,521
Hello.
Excuse me, miss.

85
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:53,271
My name is Eric. This is my house.
My party, sort of.

86
00:06:53,394 --> 00:06:56,646
See, you're looking at a bunch different of options.
But, this is the one you want go for it..

87
00:06:56,769 --> 00:06:59,271
This is the finest box of wine in the county.

88
00:06:59,394 --> 00:07:00,000
Really?

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,605
Yes, delicious

90
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:04,730
It has absolutely no body and an
amazing cough-syrupy aftertaste.

91
00:07:04,852 --> 00:07:05,352
Go ahead.

92
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:05,999
Cheers.

93
00:07:06,146 --> 00:07:08,946
Knock it up! Don't get it on your skin.
All right?

94
00:07:11,102 --> 00:07:12,202
Not bad, right?

95
00:07:12,202 --> 00:07:12,902
Mmm. Really good wine.

96
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:15,527
Even better bean dip.

97
00:07:15,527 --> 00:07:16,307
That's not bean dip!

98
00:07:16,307 --> 00:07:17,603
What?!

99
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:18,446
I'm kidding.

100
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:20,396
You knew that.
That's awesome.

101
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,619
You're only the first person to actually eat out of that.

102
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:24,819
Yeah, not many people are thrilled about eating out of a shitter.

103
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,719
---

104
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:26,018
Really?

105
00:07:27,018 --> 00:07:28,718
Couse in prison, we used our crapper as a punchbowl.

106
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:30,563
Really?
No kidding?

107
00:07:30,686 --> 00:07:33,230
I have never seen you at one of these things.
I'm i wrong?

108
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:34,052
First time.

109
00:07:34,295 --> 00:07:35,338
Really? We'll have to change that.

110
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:37,261
We do these kind of things all the time. You know..

111
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:40,383
Labor Day. We're gonna have a big Winter Wonderland party.

112
00:07:40,344 --> 00:07:41,095
It's gonna be nice.

113
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:42,646
It's gonna be.. Snow machine..

114
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:44,896
Gonna be sledding.
Should be interesting.

115
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:46,896
You should give me your information.

116
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:47,603
What?

117
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:48,188
"Information"?

118
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:48,937
Are you kidding me?

119
00:07:48,937 --> 00:07:49,563
No.

120
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:50,228
Really?

121
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:50,771
Yes.

122
00:07:50,894 --> 00:07:52,063
Yes, like what?

123
00:07:52,186 --> 00:07:54,563
Like my social security number,
my college GPA?

124
00:07:54,686 --> 00:07:57,980
Why don't we shirt with your
phone number and your shoe size?

125
00:08:00,811 --> 00:08:02,208
I happen to have a pen.

126
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,105
Of course you have a pen.

127
00:08:03,727 --> 00:08:06,396
You gotta be ready.
Always be prepared.

128
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,688
What?

129
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:08,833
On my baby.

130
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:09,855
Look at that.

131
00:08:09,977 --> 00:08:13,105
Oh, I'm so jealous of this baby.
I'm so jealous.

132
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:16,771
Oh, you wanna get out,
I wanna get in there. I'm kidding.

133
00:08:16,894 --> 00:08:18,605
Kelly, local number?

134
00:08:18,727 --> 00:08:19,813
Local girl.

135
00:08:19,936 --> 00:08:21,063
You kidding me?

136
00:08:21,185 --> 00:08:22,688
Size 9 shoe.

137
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,354
You know what they say.
'Big shoe, big uterus.'

138
00:08:26,685 --> 00:08:28,688
I'll bring friends.
Real sorry.

139
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,396
If you excuse me,
I see an old friend just showed up.

140
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,646
I'll talk to you liner

141
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:34,313
Okay.
It's very nice meeting you.

142
00:08:34,435 --> 00:08:35,938
Nice to meet you too.
Hey, fucko.

143
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,604
Excuse me.

144
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,688
I'm really mad, actually.

145
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,812
What's wrong with this guy?

146
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:41,813
Bye, guys.

147
00:08:41,935 --> 00:08:43,313
Daddy's gotta go home.

148
00:08:43,435 --> 00:08:45,729
One more for the road.
Shotgun!

149
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:47,885
Michael!

150
00:08:48,382 --> 00:08:49,582
I wasn't ready. Throw me another.

151
00:08:49,082 --> 00:08:49,802
Nice, asshole!

152
00:08:50,124 --> 00:08:51,146
You're supposed to catch that.

153
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:52,688
Come on, baby, we're going.

154
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,374
Bye, guys.

155
00:08:53,374 --> 00:08:53,938
Bye, Katie.

156
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,813
I'm sorry if I got beer on your baby.

157
00:08:56,144 --> 00:08:57,688
You, you.
Where have you been?

158
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,979
I'm sorry, man.
There was a fucking mess in the studio.

159
00:09:00,102 --> 00:09:02,063
There was this buzzing undertone

160
00:09:02,185 --> 00:09:04,646
that was bending me over and fucking me in the ass.

161
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:07,313
I'm not seeing any doughnuts.

162
00:09:06,935 --> 00:09:08,979
You specifically said get the glazed.

163
00:09:09,102 --> 00:09:11,479
They didn't have glazed.
I tried. There was jelly.

164
00:09:11,602 --> 00:09:14,938
There was Boston cream.
Jelly, Boston cream.

165
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,979
Eric, I have a whole package of ginger candies in my bag.

166
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:20,313
Hi, Willow.

167
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,479
Mmm, thank you.
But we're gonna be okay.

168
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,438
I found you a big brown naked!

169
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,521
I can't get it off!
I can't shake it off!

170
00:09:26,644 --> 00:09:29,313
Hey, everybody naked in the pool.

171
00:09:34,102 --> 00:09:36,104
Well, that's a half hour ahead of schedule.

172
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:40,604
Yeah!
Anybody?

173
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:42,188
Anybody?

174
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,688
Oh, you all suck.
Chicken shit!

175
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,146
Want me to go to Brent's?
Pick up Entenmann's?

176
00:09:47,146 --> 00:09:48,969
No, no, don't worry about it. It's allright.

177
00:09:48,969 --> 00:09:50,438
Right now, I'm gonna go jump in that pool

178
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,521
because McCrudden is dying in there alone.

179
00:09:52,644 --> 00:09:55,771
That's what friends do.
See, they don't leave each other hanging.

180
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:58,271
Where's your patriotism?

181
00:09:58,394 --> 00:09:59,479
My man.

182
00:09:59,602 --> 00:10:01,146
I got you.

183
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,229
My fucking blackberry.

184
00:10:30,685 --> 00:10:32,229
Hey dad, what are you doing here?

185
00:10:32,352 --> 00:10:34,146
Uh, hmm.

186
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:37,396
Oh, yeah, I own the place.
Cherie, this is my son, Eric.

187
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,771
Hi.
He's told me all about you.

188
00:10:41,852 --> 00:10:42,979
Ah, yeah.

189
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:45,354
Great party.
Thanks for letting us sleep it off.

190
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:46,312
No problem.

191
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:50,012
Hm. It must have been quite a fiesta.

192
00:10:50,144 --> 00:10:51,354
Oh, yeah,
I guess so.

193
00:10:51,477 --> 00:10:53,188
Did the best I could with the turds.

194
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,082
I know you did, Bill.

195
00:10:55,082 --> 00:10:56,854
I wish you would have let me know you were coming out.

196
00:10:56,977 --> 00:10:59,063
Maybe we can throw someone down on a couch.
Or something like that.

197
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:00,688
Ah, we're not staying.

198
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,229
I just came out for the day to do a
meet-and-greet with the brokers.

199
00:11:05,352 --> 00:11:06,479
Brokers?

200
00:11:06,602 --> 00:11:08,438
You got the message, right?

201
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,521
I saw that you called.

202
00:11:10,644 --> 00:11:12,688
I'm putting the house on the market.

203
00:11:13,644 --> 00:11:15,771
What?
Wait, you're selling our house?

204
00:11:16,894 --> 00:11:20,229
Ah, I'm hardly ever out here any more.

205
00:11:20,352 --> 00:11:22,854
It's time to unload.

206
00:11:22,977 --> 00:11:24,271
But hey,
what about me?

207
00:11:24,394 --> 00:11:28,479
I'm always out here.
My friends are always out here.

208
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,854
So make me an offer.

209
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,146
Dad, come on.
I don't ask you for anything.

210
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:38,188
How about this?
We go get breakfast.

211
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,979
We talk over the house situation.

212
00:11:39,602 --> 00:11:41,729
Maybe we all can chip in for utilities?

213
00:11:42,052 --> 00:11:44,013
Ah, I'm a little pressed for time, kiddo.

214
00:11:44,877 --> 00:11:48,879
We're gonna go play a quick nine and then got get back.

215
00:11:48,602 --> 00:11:50,354
Cherie's never played before.

216
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:51,812
I'm so excited.

217
00:11:51,932 --> 00:11:53,482
Dad, this is fucking bullshit.

218
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:56,649
I'll call you next week.
We'll do yoga.

219
00:12:07,932 --> 00:12:10,607
I've said it before and I'll say it again.

220
00:12:10,724 --> 00:12:13,357
Your dad is a selfish prick.

221
00:12:13,974 --> 00:12:15,982
Smoothie?

222
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:17,690
It's gonna be sad not coming out here anymore.

223
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:20,274
Me and Willy might not even be around next summer.

224
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,774
The L.A. thing again?
Are you serious?

225
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,940
You just moved into that place in Brooklyn.

226
00:12:25,057 --> 00:12:27,357
But Willow's doing really good with her acting career.

227
00:12:27,474 --> 00:12:30,232
She did that Pizza Hut Latin America commercial now.

228
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,440
<i>Ooh, deliciosa!</i>

229
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,607
Her dad is gonna hook me up with a job at a big law firm.

230
00:12:36,724 --> 00:12:37,982
Dude, what about the fucking album?

231
00:12:38,099 --> 00:12:40,149
I'll work on the album while I'm doing law things.

232
00:12:40,265 --> 00:12:41,457
Oh, yeah? Will you?

233
00:12:41,457 --> 00:12:42,649
You know what I'm excited about?

234
00:12:43,265 --> 00:12:46,190
Throwing one of these parties
in my one-bedroom apartment in New York city.

235
00:12:46,107 --> 00:12:47,490
That'll be fun, right?

236
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:49,774
Maybe I can put, like, the food out on the fire escape.

237
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,011
Eric. 

238
00:12:50,511 --> 00:12:51,732
The band in the bathroom.

239
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:53,232
I have to get more outlets though.

240
00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:55,690
I'll get a power strip.
Why not? I'll splurge.

241
00:12:56,607 --> 00:12:57,341
What?

242
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,190
This is a major moment.

243
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,190
It's okay to let the hurt in.

244
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:05,190
To allow yourself to actually be present in a moment.

245
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:07,907
Okay, thanks, doc.
You really make the moment more real

246
00:13:07,907 --> 00:13:10,399
by talking about how real the moment is in the middle.

247
00:13:10,515 --> 00:13:13,565
No, I understand.
You're probably feeling

248
00:13:13,682 --> 00:13:15,940
some anger and some misdirected frustra...

249
00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:18,707
Feel better now?

250
00:13:18,707 --> 00:13:19,732
A little bit, yeah.

251
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:20,949
Dude, that was awesome.

252
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:22,124
Oh, fuck!

253
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:24,832
What about now?

254
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:25,824
Oh, much better.

255
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,815
Now I'm in the moment.

256
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,965
<i>I don't understand all the summer school things.</i>

257
00:13:31,182 --> 00:13:33,857
Isn't the point of being a teacher
that you get summers off?

258
00:13:33,974 --> 00:13:37,190
Yeah, well, they pay us poop, so,
what am I gonna do, waitress?

259
00:13:37,307 --> 00:13:39,857
Oh, my God,
the big news.

260
00:13:40,432 --> 00:13:43,690
So the principal told me today

261
00:13:43,307 --> 00:13:48,774
that the friendship bracelets that the girls
are wearing are actually sex bracelets.

262
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,390
I saw something about that on Oprah.

263
00:13:52,807 --> 00:13:55,024
Girls wear these different color bracelets

264
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,024
and every color represents, like,
a sex thing.

265
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,690
So if you tear off a girl's blue bracelet,

266
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,690
that means she has to give you oral.

267
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,146
What's a yellow bracelet?

268
00:14:04,646 --> 00:14:05,809
Uh, a hug.

269
00:14:05,938 --> 00:14:06,603
Aww. Oh, sweet.

270
00:14:06,603 --> 00:14:07,268
I know.

271
00:14:07,268 --> 00:14:09,646
What about purple?

272
00:14:09,646 --> 00:14:10,684
Teabagging?

273
00:14:12,563 --> 00:14:13,684
Really?

274
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:15,809
Well, what is teabagging?

275
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,018
Balls in mouth.

276
00:14:17,146 --> 00:14:18,809
Oh, no!

277
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:21,684
Teabagging? What is with the kids today?

278
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:24,646
Well, the blowjob is the new French kiss.

279
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:26,643
Wow, we really missed the boat on that one.

280
00:14:26,771 --> 00:14:29,476
I feel like if we had had sex bracelets back then,

281
00:14:29,605 --> 00:14:31,226
no one would have torn mine off.

282
00:14:31,355 --> 00:14:33,601
No, no, no, sweetie.

283
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,976
I would have torn off your BJ bracelet.

284
00:14:36,105 --> 00:14:38,768
You're just saying that,
but thanks, Eric.

285
00:14:38,896 --> 00:14:40,559
Thanks for letting me blow you.

286
00:14:40,688 --> 00:14:41,832
You're welcome.

287
00:14:41,832 --> 00:14:42,976
You're such a good friend.

288
00:14:47,271 --> 00:14:49,809
Hey, Dody.

289
00:14:52,938 --> 00:14:55,309
Hi. Can I help you?

290
00:14:55,438 --> 00:14:56,269
Are you Eric?

291
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:57,101
Yes.

292
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,268
Hi. We spoke on the phone.

293
00:14:59,396 --> 00:15:02,101
I'm Dody Henderson from the Henderson Realty Group.

294
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,184
And this is my associate Kelly Tanner.

295
00:15:04,313 --> 00:15:06,768
Hi. How are you?

296
00:15:08,405 --> 00:15:09,484
No, thank you.

297
00:15:09,313 --> 00:15:10,434
Lame.

298
00:15:10,563 --> 00:15:11,601
Oh, I shouldn't.

299
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:15,684
We can't wait to get your house sold.

300
00:15:15,813 --> 00:15:18,101
We need this place clean, clean, clean every day.

301
00:15:18,229 --> 00:15:19,767
Water the lawns,
skim the pool.

302
00:15:19,854 --> 00:15:24,184
You never know when buyers are
gonna stop by to say hi and buy, buy.

303
00:15:24,313 --> 00:15:26,142
Oh, B-U-Y!
Ha, ha!

304
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:28,351
Whatever.

305
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:32,434
Oh, and make sure the toilets
are clean enough to eat out of it.

306
00:15:32,563 --> 00:15:34,101
Yeah, whatever.

307
00:15:34,563 --> 00:15:37,392
Maybe I should sprinkle some
rose petals on the driveway every morning too.

308
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:39,101
Just do what you can.

309
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:39,929
Will do.

310
00:15:41,938 --> 00:15:45,267
What are the chances of maybe
selling this sometime after Labor Day?

311
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:48,559
You wanna sell a summer home during the summer.

312
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:49,934
That's kind of the point.

313
00:15:50,771 --> 00:15:52,851
So glad we're in business together.

314
00:15:52,979 --> 00:15:54,267
<i>Om shanti.</i>

315
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,767
<i>Om shanti</i> it is.

316
00:16:00,146 --> 00:16:01,146
Vultures.

317
00:16:01,146 --> 00:16:01,846
Yeesh.

318
00:16:04,021 --> 00:16:06,601
It's light.
It's light.

319
00:16:06,729 --> 00:16:08,892
We should put it up more closer.
Like there?

320
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:12,434
Oh, yeah.
That'll bring in all the right clientele.

321
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:24,767
Listen. Have you given any more
thought to the final Labor Day blowout?

322
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:26,101
I really don't know.

323
00:16:26,229 --> 00:16:28,642
I mean, obviously,
we got do something huge.

324
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:31,101
But what do you do for a final blowout?

325
00:16:31,229 --> 00:16:33,851
Go out in a fucking blaze of glory.
Heads held high. You know what i'm sayin?

326
00:16:33,979 --> 00:16:34,607
I get it.

327
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:35,434
Deserved it.

328
00:16:35,563 --> 00:16:37,351
Holy shit. Oh, shit.
Here we go. Bingo.

329
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:38,179
What?

330
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:39,351
I got the concept right here.

331
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:40,934
Brown party...

332
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:42,601
Brown party.- Brown party...

333
00:16:42,729 --> 00:16:44,892
Brown clothes,
brown food, brown drink,

334
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:46,921
brown clown,
brown balloons,

335
00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:49,121
live music supplied by Jackson Browne.

336
00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:52,321
I don't know what you're thinking right now.
Is that good?

337
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:53,809
It's fucking awful.

338
00:16:54,238 --> 00:16:56,901
Alright, take it easy.
I'm just spit balling headchief.

339
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:58,851
It's not like you're throwing ideas my way.

340
00:16:58,979 --> 00:17:00,061
He spells with an <i>E</i> at the end.

341
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,142
Doesn't matter.

342
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:02,771
Holy shit.
We got a situation here.

343
00:17:04,063 --> 00:17:05,809
Oh, my fucking God.

344
00:17:06,438 --> 00:17:08,726
Dude, she's wearing a sex bracelet.

345
00:17:08,354 --> 00:17:09,726
Holy fuck,
she is.

346
00:17:09,854 --> 00:17:11,754
Oh, boy,
that's trouble.

347
00:17:11,754 --> 00:17:12,854
It's blue. It's blue.

348
00:17:13,454 --> 00:17:15,442
Sword swallower.

349
00:17:14,771 --> 00:17:16,771
Holy fuck man, when she reaches out for my cone

350
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:17,684
I'm gonna snag that thing

351
00:17:17,813 --> 00:17:19,976
and it's deep-throat city all night long.

352
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:21,434
No, no, no.

353
00:17:21,434 --> 00:17:23,734
Please don't do that. Don't. No, stop.

354
00:17:24,646 --> 00:17:26,392
Stop! Stop it

355
00:17:28,021 --> 00:17:31,059
I bet she unhinges her jaw like a
fucking python swallowing a rat.

356
00:17:30,888 --> 00:17:33,676
Um, do you guys know what you want?

357
00:17:34,104 --> 00:17:34,704
Yes, we do.

358
00:17:34,704 --> 00:17:36,226
Yeah. We got a pretty good idea.

359
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:37,976
No, ice cream is what we're into.

360
00:17:40,938 --> 00:17:44,684
Do you think a girl like that looks at
us like we're a couple of old dudes?

361
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,913
You know like the way we used to look at

362
00:17:45,913 --> 00:17:48,101
30-year-old guys back in high school and say,

363
00:17:48,229 --> 00:17:51,767
'Oh, man, look at that lame old guy hitting on Sue.'

364
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:54,646
Ha, ha. Yeah, probably.

365
00:17:54,646 --> 00:17:55,546
Shit, I don't know though.

366
00:17:55,546 --> 00:17:57,392
Weren't 30-year-old guys a lot older back then

367
00:17:57,392 --> 00:17:59,101
with, like,
mustaches and jobs?

368
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:01,434
Yeah It certainly seemed like it

369
00:18:02,771 --> 00:18:03,851
What?

370
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:05,279
Fuck, dude, we're getting old.

371
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,142
Bullshit. Come on.

372
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:08,642
Seriously, I got a foot cramp the other day masturbating.

373
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:10,269
What? Doesn't make sense.

374
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:11,767
I swear to God. It happened.

375
00:18:11,896 --> 00:18:12,696
What about this,

376
00:18:12,696 --> 00:18:15,101
Do you think that girl and her
friends really have BJ orgy parties?

377
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:16,029
Indubitably

378
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:16,434
Really?

379
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,601
Fucking 'A' man, Duquez is right.
We got fucking hosed.

380
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:20,726
God dang.

381
00:18:21,729 --> 00:18:23,601
Hey, what about that?

382
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:24,726
What about what?

383
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,601
What about that for the final party?

384
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:27,929
What?

385
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:28,929
An orgy.

386
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:30,011
An orgy?

387
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:30,759
An orgy...

388
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:31,688
You wanna have an fucking orgy?

389
00:18:31,688 --> 00:18:32,226
Yeah, why not?

390
00:18:32,354 --> 00:18:34,059
Get the fuck out of town.
It'll never happen.

391
00:18:34,188 --> 00:18:35,476
Why not?

392
00:18:35,604 --> 00:18:37,726
Because people don't have orgies,
you know?

393
00:18:37,854 --> 00:18:39,309
Oh, come on.
They used to.

394
00:18:39,438 --> 00:18:40,038
True.

395
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:41,267
Yeah, think about it, dude.

396
00:18:41,396 --> 00:18:44,309
An orgy.
A good old-fashioned orgy.

397
00:18:44,771 --> 00:18:45,571
Wowie.

398
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:47,142
That is a blaze of glory.

399
00:18:47,271 --> 00:18:50,267
Okay.
Now you know I hate naysayers, right?

400
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:51,892
But I'm gonna have to say nay.

401
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:52,707
Really?

402
00:18:52,707 --> 00:18:53,392
Really.

403
00:18:53,521 --> 00:18:55,142
Are you throwing down the gauntlet?

404
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:57,225
Oops, what's that?

405
00:18:57,354 --> 00:18:59,684
It's on the ground as we speak.

406
00:19:01,521 --> 00:19:02,892
We're gonna have an orgy.

407
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:05,767
We're gonna have an orgy.

408
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,767
Oh, boy.
Here we go.

409
00:19:09,312 --> 00:19:11,350
Okay, guys,
I've been mulling it over and

410
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:13,434
I have a concept for the final fiesta.

411
00:19:13,562 --> 00:19:14,456
All right.

412
00:19:14,456 --> 00:19:15,350
What is it?

413
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:16,164
Whoo!

414
00:19:16,164 --> 00:19:16,850
Fiesta

415
00:19:16,979 --> 00:19:19,017
Allright, while this will be the most spectacular

416
00:19:19,146 --> 00:19:23,350
and insane party any of us have taken part of,
it's not gonna be a big thing.

417
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:24,767
It's just gonna be us.

418
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:25,896
It's gonna be small,

419
00:19:27,373 --> 00:19:27,973
intimate,

420
00:19:29,273 --> 00:19:30,073
special.

421
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:31,973
Oh, I'll make lasagna.

422
00:19:32,373 --> 00:19:33,767
Yummy.

423
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:34,734
Oh, yeah.

424
00:19:34,562 --> 00:19:35,850
We're gonna have an orgy.

425
00:19:39,729 --> 00:19:40,727
Who?

426
00:19:40,727 --> 00:19:41,725
Us.

427
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:44,079
Where?

428
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:45,684
Here, right here. Labor Day weekend.

429
00:19:45,812 --> 00:19:49,725
Us?
A naked sex orgy?

430
00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:51,102
You're kidding, right?

431
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:52,350
No, I'm not. Why not us?

432
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:54,309
People used to have them all the time.

433
00:19:54,437 --> 00:19:55,642
All the time.

434
00:19:55,771 --> 00:19:57,309
Yeah! What happened to our generation?

435
00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:58,337
What happened?

436
00:19:58,337 --> 00:19:59,684
I'll tell you exactly what happened.

437
00:19:59,812 --> 00:20:02,559
AIDS.

438
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,309
AIDS hit right when we hit puberty.

439
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:06,646
And it scared the shit out of all of us.

440
00:20:06,646 --> 00:20:10,642
It turned sex into this big,
frightening thing.

441
00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:12,142
He's right.

442
00:20:12,271 --> 00:20:15,975
Kids today are freaks,
our parents were freaks,

443
00:20:16,104 --> 00:20:17,725
we're a bunch of fucking pussies.

444
00:20:17,854 --> 00:20:19,164
We're the lamest generation.

445
00:20:19,164 --> 00:20:20,475
This is our chance.

446
00:20:20,604 --> 00:20:21,850
Our chance to do it right.

447
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:24,017
Take back what's been taken from us.

448
00:20:24,017 --> 00:20:25,332
Isn't that from Goonies?

449
00:20:25,332 --> 00:20:26,646
Yeah, I'm paraphrasing Goonies, yes.

450
00:20:26,646 --> 00:20:27,977
Orgy.

451
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,309
Orgy...

452
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:33,267
Orgy.

453
00:20:33,396 --> 00:20:35,725
Duquez, come on my men.
You're into this, right?

454
00:20:35,854 --> 00:20:39,184
What?
No.

455
00:20:39,312 --> 00:20:42,309
We're all friends.
It would just be too weird.

456
00:20:42,437 --> 00:20:44,137
How do you know unless you try?

457
00:20:44,737 --> 00:20:45,950
Ew!

458
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:47,979
Look, if we all went into this with an open mind,

459
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:50,679
it could be amazing.

460
00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:53,434
In theory,
a noble call to arms.

461
00:20:53,562 --> 00:20:58,267
In practice,
I cannot imagine a more awkward

462
00:20:58,396 --> 00:21:00,434
and uncomfortably terrible evening.

463
00:21:00,562 --> 00:21:03,348
Oh, laugh, laugh,
laugh all you want.

464
00:21:03,481 --> 00:21:05,723
Seriously, don't you get it?
This is it,

465
00:21:05,856 --> 00:21:08,932
the final blowout,
and then the house is gone.

466
00:21:09,064 --> 00:21:10,727
People move away.

467
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,390
Things change.

468
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:14,973
We need to think outside of the box.

469
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:18,057
And inside the box.

470
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:19,432
Eww.

471
00:21:19,564 --> 00:21:21,640
Mike, come on man, that's not what I'm going for.

472
00:21:21,773 --> 00:21:23,098
I'm in.

473
00:21:23,524 --> 00:21:24,681
What?

474
00:21:24,815 --> 00:21:25,889
Are you serious?

475
00:21:26,024 --> 00:21:28,139
Yes, it worked.

476
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:30,056
Come on.
An orgy?

477
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,556
It's madness.

478
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,390
Ugh.

479
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,764
It's gonna be a fucking blast.

480
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:36,431
Success!
Success!

481
00:21:36,565 --> 00:21:38,722
Sue's in.
Thank you, yes.

482
00:21:38,857 --> 00:21:39,889
Here we go.
Come on.

483
00:21:40,024 --> 00:21:41,373
I'm gonna go meet Marcus.

484
00:21:41,373 --> 00:21:42,722
Oh, my God.

485
00:21:42,857 --> 00:21:45,431
All right, think it over.
Think it... Everybody, okay.

486
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:46,889
All right,
I get it.

487
00:21:47,024 --> 00:21:49,889
It's gonna take a while to come
around on this whole orgy idea.

488
00:21:50,024 --> 00:21:52,056
Right? Here?
No, okay. Ha, ha!

489
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:55,931
Very good, but go ahead, type it in your BlackBerrys,
pencil it in your notebooks.

490
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,389
Orgy.
Orgy.

491
00:21:58,524 --> 00:22:00,681
<i>Orgy.
Orgy.</i>

492
00:22:00,815 --> 00:22:03,847
<i>Orgy.
Orgy. Orgy.</i>

493
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:13,931
So, Sue, you think this is how you're gonna
finally sleep with Eric?

494
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:17,148
What? We dated in high school.

495
00:22:17,148 --> 00:22:18,722
Come on,
that was ages ago.

496
00:22:18,857 --> 00:22:20,639
You guys never,
you know, did it,

497
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,597
so it's kind of unfinished business.

498
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:26,097
Yeah, but I've slept with like a ton of guys since then,

499
00:22:26,232 --> 00:22:28,764
so this doesn't have anything to do with it.

500
00:22:28,898 --> 00:22:31,680
Ok fine, but other than social awkwardness,

501
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,148
give me one reason.

502
00:22:33,148 --> 00:22:36,264
Oh, very well.
How about I give you several reasons?

503
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:37,972
Like, oh,
I don't know,

504
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,805
chlamydia, the herp,

505
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,805
gonorrhea, syphilis, papilloma.

506
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,305
The Steve McQueen movie?

507
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,440
No, that's Papillon.

508
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,139
I'm talking about the virus that causes genital warts.

509
00:22:49,273 --> 00:22:51,472
Ugh.
Why do you think of this stuff?

510
00:22:51,607 --> 00:22:54,639
Don't you guys remember the article my
mom clipped from The New Yorker?

511
00:22:57,357 --> 00:22:58,639
No.

512
00:22:58,773 --> 00:23:01,180
Condoms can't stop it and it causes cervical cancer.

513
00:23:01,315 --> 00:23:03,222
You don't have a cervix.

514
00:23:03,773 --> 00:23:07,514
I don't know how you could have
sex in front of a room full of people.

515
00:23:07,648 --> 00:23:10,805
I mean,
I don't even like to get naked at the spa.

516
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,805
I'm not saying that this is gonna be easy for me,

517
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,930
but isn't that what kind of makes it exciting?

518
00:23:17,065 --> 00:23:19,639
I'm not saying that it wouldn't be fun,

519
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,764
but it's an orgy.

520
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:23,972
What's the point of losing all this weight

521
00:23:24,107 --> 00:23:26,097
if you're not gonna show off your new bod?

522
00:23:26,097 --> 00:23:28,148
I mean, You haven't even worn your bikini yet.

523
00:23:28,148 --> 00:23:29,597
I still have 5 more pounds.

524
00:23:29,732 --> 00:23:32,597
I just think this really could help build your self-esteem.

525
00:23:32,732 --> 00:23:38,180
There's the miracle cure. I'm gonna start turning
my clients onto group sex instead of Zoloft.

526
00:23:38,315 --> 00:23:40,555
We're going to the beach.
At least do that.

527
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,727
C'mon. It's our last summer.

528
00:23:41,727 --> 00:23:42,764
Let's go to the beach.

529
00:23:42,398 --> 00:23:43,098
You know what?

530
00:23:43,098 --> 00:23:46,430
Shockingly, I'm gonna pass on the
stroll through the tick-infested dunes.

531
00:23:47,065 --> 00:23:48,597
Dude, I've had Lyme disease.

532
00:23:48,732 --> 00:23:51,264
It's not a big deal.
It's antibiotics, boom, done.

533
00:23:51,398 --> 00:23:54,639
You know I have a needle phobia.
Okay? I can't go to the doctor.

534
00:23:54,773 --> 00:23:57,430
The puncturing the veins and the... Ugh.

535
00:23:57,565 --> 00:24:00,055
Okay, whatever.
Enjoy the great indoors.

536
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,389
Yeah. Bye.

537
00:24:02,523 --> 00:24:05,889
Ooh, hey, Eric.
Uh, could you grab some sand for my ass crack?

538
00:24:06,023 --> 00:24:07,597
I'll grab some for your cervix.

539
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,055
Okay.
Let's say you dated four guys in one year,

540
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,222
right, and you slept with them.

541
00:24:14,357 --> 00:24:15,456
You'd be cool with that?

542
00:24:15,456 --> 00:24:16,555
Totally.

543
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,764
And how many guys have you slept with this year?

544
00:24:20,523 --> 00:24:22,555
None.

545
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,097
Or the year before.

546
00:24:24,232 --> 00:24:27,597
So really all you're doing is sleeping with four guys

547
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,139
in, like,
a shorter time frame.

548
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,430
I never really thought of it that way.

549
00:24:34,565 --> 00:24:35,639
What do you think?

550
00:24:35,773 --> 00:24:38,930
Insane, idiotic and self-destructive.

551
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:45,039
Okay, hypothetically.

552
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,148
If I did decide to do it, but at the last minute,

553
00:24:47,148 --> 00:24:49,305
I totally freaked out,

554
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,430
they would let me out, right?

555
00:24:52,565 --> 00:24:54,847
Laura, it's an orgy,
not The Accused.

556
00:24:54,982 --> 00:24:58,097
It's not fun unless everybody's into it.

557
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,097
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it.

558
00:25:02,232 --> 00:25:03,373
I'm gonna do it.

559
00:25:03,373 --> 00:25:04,514
Yeah? Yeah?

560
00:25:04,648 --> 00:25:05,685
I'm gonna do it.

561
00:25:05,685 --> 00:25:06,722
All right. Yeah, girl.

562
00:25:06,857 --> 00:25:09,055
Hey, guys,
what's the celebration?

563
00:25:10,982 --> 00:25:13,680
Just talking about how to get Laura back in the saddle.

564
00:25:13,815 --> 00:25:16,430
Whoo, yay!
I'm gonna find you a guy.

565
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,347
Glenn's cousin Frank is coming to the wedding.

566
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,305
Okay, Game on.
Let's go.

567
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,639
All right,
John Kruk.

568
00:25:26,773 --> 00:25:30,264
I'll tell you what I'm gonna throw,
and you're still gonna whiff at it.

569
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,139
Slow breaking curveball.

570
00:25:34,107 --> 00:25:35,180
Oh!

571
00:25:35,315 --> 00:25:37,347
Goddamn it!
I dare you to throw that shit again.

572
00:25:37,482 --> 00:25:40,472
Swish full,
the nerd's revenge.

573
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:42,555
Ooh, I got my bunt face on.

574
00:25:42,555 --> 00:25:45,148
Drills, ladies. Drills. Let's go. Look alive.

575
00:25:45,148 --> 00:25:46,513
Album cover,
hat or no hat?

576
00:25:46,648 --> 00:25:48,638
Oh, Doug,
come on, man.

577
00:25:48,773 --> 00:25:50,680
You've been doing this for two years.

578
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,305
Mixing, remixing.
Hatting, no hatting.

579
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,597
Your music's awesome.
You just get it out there.

580
00:25:55,731 --> 00:25:59,555
No one will give it a shot if they don't dig my look.
It's an image-based industry.

581
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,097
What the fuck?
This is exactly why you're headed for a shitty job.

582
00:26:03,231 --> 00:26:06,763
You need to stop trying to look like
a rock star and start fucking living like one.

583
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:07,622
Yeah, do the orgy.

584
00:26:07,622 --> 00:26:08,347
Do the orgy.

585
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:09,972
You think Mick Jagger would have said,

586
00:26:10,106 --> 00:26:12,180
'No thanks, mate. No orgy for me.

587
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,148
I've got an on-again-off-again girlfriend.'

588
00:26:14,148 --> 00:26:16,305
'I don't wanna cheat on David Bowie.'

589
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,519
'No cheating on Bowie.'

590
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:18,597
Hey, Willow.

591
00:26:19,981 --> 00:26:21,680
I know what Tom Hanks feels like now.

592
00:26:21,815 --> 00:26:23,763
See, my only concern, Duque,

593
00:26:23,898 --> 00:26:26,263
is that the hat maybe doesn't make you look gay enough.

594
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:27,597
Oh, yeah.

595
00:26:27,731 --> 00:26:30,347
You could Photoshop in three guys jizzing on your face?

596
00:26:30,481 --> 00:26:32,930
Or on the hat?
Ooh, ooh.

597
00:26:33,065 --> 00:26:34,305
That's good.

598
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
You know, you could do,

599
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,540
You could take that five-song demo,
maybe, make it a double album.

600
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,930
One with the hat, one without it?

601
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,030
Yeah, that's good idea.

602
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,430
You could call it <i>Exile on Hat Street.</i>

603
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,130
Yeah, or <i>Jagged Little Hat?</i>

604
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,730
Oh, Meat Loaf. <i>Hat Outta Hell.</i>

605
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,830
What about <i>Sgt. Pepper's</i>
<i>Lonely Hats Club Hat?</i>

606
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,130
What about just called it,

607
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,330
"My shitty friends don't respect me?"

608
00:26:52,523 --> 00:26:53,622
Pretty Indie.

609
00:26:53,622 --> 00:26:54,722
I think, you won't be able to sell at Walmart.

610
00:26:54,856 --> 00:26:56,393
Alright, who's next up to hat?

611
00:26:56,393 --> 00:26:57,930
Two and two to Harvey Key.

612
00:26:58,065 --> 00:27:00,722
Sandy winds up and delivers.

613
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,213
Fuck me!

614
00:27:03,898 --> 00:27:04,898
Hey, Ali Cat.

615
00:27:04,898 --> 00:27:05,388
Hi.

616
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:06,763
Like what you see?

617
00:27:06,898 --> 00:27:08,972
This could be all yours Labor Day weekend.

618
00:27:09,106 --> 00:27:10,888
Oh, Eric.

619
00:27:11,023 --> 00:27:12,805
Do you mind if I make an observation?

620
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,930
Oh, boy.
Sure, go ahead.

621
00:27:16,065 --> 00:27:18,055
You have intimacy issues.

622
00:27:18,148 --> 00:27:18,768
Really?

623
00:27:18,768 --> 00:27:19,388
Yeah.

624
00:27:19,523 --> 00:27:21,888
I figured an orgy is as intimate as it can get.

625
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:24,888
No, no, no,
but intimacy isn't about intercourse, Eric.

626
00:27:25,023 --> 00:27:25,823
It's about emotion.

627
00:27:25,823 --> 00:27:26,305
Mm-hm.

628
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,263
You don't need to get laid.
You need to be in a relationship.

629
00:27:31,298 --> 00:27:34,698
Look, just because you're in an unhappy
relationship,

630
00:27:34,847 --> 00:27:37,247
doesn't mean the rest of us need to be.

631
00:27:36,047 --> 00:27:38,448
I'm not in an unhappy relationship.

632
00:27:38,148 --> 00:27:41,055
I'm in an adult relationship.

633
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,185
It's lot a fun, whatever it is.

634
00:27:42,685 --> 00:27:43,680
Hold on one sec?

635
00:27:43,315 --> 00:27:46,388
Say, hey, Marcus.
You want to take a few cracks with the bat?

636
00:27:46,523 --> 00:27:47,523
No, thank you.

637
00:27:47,923 --> 00:27:51,223
Football is my game, European football.

638
00:27:51,223 --> 00:27:52,472
Gotcha.

639
00:27:52,606 --> 00:27:54,888
Did he date Siegfried or Roy?
I can't remember.

640
00:27:57,481 --> 00:28:00,263
God, it's embarrassing watching you play this sport.

641
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:03,180
Aww, it's cow shit.

642
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:06,180
Look, doc,
it's your life.

643
00:28:06,315 --> 00:28:07,722
You can do whatever you want.

644
00:28:07,815 --> 00:28:10,138
All I'm saying is that maybe Labor Day weekend

645
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:12,597
might be the last chopper out of Saigon for you.

646
00:28:20,898 --> 00:28:23,222
Knock, knock.
Guess who.

647
00:28:23,356 --> 00:28:24,656
Dody!

648
00:28:26,315 --> 00:28:27,476
These are the Webers.

649
00:28:27,476 --> 00:28:28,638
How you doing?

650
00:28:28,538 --> 00:28:30,048
We brought some extra signs

651
00:28:30,248 --> 00:28:31,947
because someone is stealing ours.

652
00:28:31,981 --> 00:28:33,680
Oh. That's too bad.

653
00:28:34,523 --> 00:28:36,323
Oh, good. Okay.

654
00:28:36,323 --> 00:28:38,023
Hey, guys. Would you do me a favor?

655
00:28:38,223 --> 00:28:38,997
When you go in the house,

656
00:28:38,997 --> 00:28:40,297
don't go to the basement or anything.

657
00:28:40,606 --> 00:28:44,805
Not that there's anything or anyone
down there in a cage or otherwise.

658
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,972
Thanks, Eric.
That's so helpful.

659
00:28:48,106 --> 00:28:49,305
What is he talking about?

660
00:28:49,398 --> 00:28:52,305
Oh, gosh. Don't worry.
Don't worry.

661
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,763
He's a little off.

662
00:28:55,898 --> 00:28:57,180
It's a head injury.

663
00:28:57,315 --> 00:28:59,430
That's why he wears the helmet.

664
00:28:59,565 --> 00:29:02,097
Are they all challenged?

665
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:05,263
Yes.
But at least they have each other.

666
00:29:05,356 --> 00:29:08,597
Oh, that's so great.

667
00:29:08,731 --> 00:29:11,305
Have fun with your game, sweetie.

668
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,930
Thanks, Mrs. Weber.

669
00:29:14,189 --> 00:29:17,471
We are five minutes from Indian Wells Beach.

670
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,846
And wait till you see your bedroom.

671
00:29:58,023 --> 00:30:00,555
What if someone comes in?
These people never knock.

672
00:30:00,689 --> 00:30:03,138
I just locked the door.

673
00:30:03,273 --> 00:30:07,138
Fine, but you really must be quiet.

674
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:08,638
None of your usual screeches.

675
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:09,581
Okay, okay, okay.

676
00:30:09,581 --> 00:30:10,388
Yes?

677
00:30:10,523 --> 00:30:12,596
Yeah.

678
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:17,513
Oh, Marcus.
Oh...

679
00:30:17,648 --> 00:30:20,180
Let's get you out of these dirty little panties.

680
00:30:20,314 --> 00:30:22,346
Do it.
What?

681
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:25,846
What's going on? Why are you stopping?
What's going on? Hey.

682
00:30:25,981 --> 00:30:27,513
What?

683
00:30:28,148 --> 00:30:29,721
What have you done to your vagina?

684
00:30:31,314 --> 00:30:32,513
I shaved it.

685
00:30:38,481 --> 00:30:39,934
Why?

686
00:30:39,934 --> 00:30:41,388
I don't know.

687
00:30:41,523 --> 00:30:46,055
Because I thought it would be something different, sexy.

688
00:30:46,189 --> 00:30:49,805
Women are supposed to have pubic hair.
Why would I find it sexy?

689
00:30:49,939 --> 00:30:52,055
You look like a prepubescent girl.

690
00:30:52,189 --> 00:30:53,596
I'm not a child molester.

691
00:30:53,731 --> 00:30:56,805
Okay, you know what, it's hair, Marcus,
and it's gonna grow back.

692
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,388
Well, I wished you would have told me

693
00:31:00,523 --> 00:31:03,055
about your little secret before I unwrapped this.

694
00:31:03,189 --> 00:31:05,638
This lambskin condoms cost 2 Euros.

695
00:31:05,773 --> 00:31:07,471
It's wasteful.

696
00:31:08,481 --> 00:31:09,680
I did it for you!

697
00:31:09,814 --> 00:31:11,805
You could have consulted with me.

698
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:18,471
Alison, you're being like a child.

699
00:31:18,564 --> 00:31:21,055
Fuck you,
go away!

700
00:31:21,189 --> 00:31:23,138
You go away.

701
00:31:23,273 --> 00:31:24,638
I think this is chemical.

702
00:31:24,773 --> 00:31:26,638
Darling, what dosage are you taking?

703
00:31:26,773 --> 00:31:28,971
You... Fuck you!

704
00:31:29,106 --> 00:31:30,471
This is your problem.

705
00:31:30,606 --> 00:31:34,055
I was just expressing my sexuality in a healthy manner.

706
00:31:34,189 --> 00:31:38,096
God forbid, Marcus,
that we experiment a little bit.

707
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:39,513
Fine.

708
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:43,596
I'm going back to the city and I'm taking the iPod.

709
00:31:43,596 --> 00:31:46,148
Fine. Leave!

710
00:31:46,148 --> 00:31:48,471
And your breath is terrible!

711
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:51,638
My breath is natural.
Unlike your vagina.

712
00:31:52,564 --> 00:31:54,138
Fuck you!

713
00:32:00,231 --> 00:32:02,680
Oh. Jesus.

714
00:32:03,564 --> 00:32:04,596
Sorry.

715
00:32:06,331 --> 00:32:07,531
It's all right.

716
00:32:10,731 --> 00:32:13,180
The worst part is I'm just peeing right now.

717
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:31,513
I've been kicking around a few ideas.

718
00:32:31,648 --> 00:32:32,748
Themes for the party.

719
00:32:32,748 --> 00:32:33,748
Let me know what you think.

720
00:32:33,748 --> 00:32:35,448
First one, Roman, right?

721
00:32:35,448 --> 00:32:37,148
You're talking togas, wine,

722
00:32:37,148 --> 00:32:39,388
bushels of grapes,
the whole deal.

723
00:32:39,523 --> 00:32:41,429
Then I also have '70s, right?

724
00:32:41,564 --> 00:32:45,054
We got the swinger vibe, polyester,
big hair,

725
00:32:45,189 --> 00:32:48,054
upstairs and down,
you know? Um, I don't know.

726
00:32:48,189 --> 00:32:50,638
What about the Kama Sutra?

727
00:32:50,772 --> 00:32:51,496
That's actually not bad.

728
00:32:51,496 --> 00:32:52,221
Yeah?

729
00:32:52,356 --> 00:32:55,096
Yeah, yeah,
like the sex secrets of the East, right?

730
00:32:55,231 --> 00:32:56,226
Mm-hm.

731
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:57,221
Oh, that's... Yeah.

732
00:32:57,356 --> 00:33:01,138
You know you have like, uh, incense, tapestries.

733
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:03,472
Veils, diaphanous fabrics.

734
00:33:03,939 --> 00:33:06,721
I have no idea what the hell that is,
but I like it.

735
00:33:06,856 --> 00:33:09,054
You and me,
we're on the same page with this think.

736
00:33:09,189 --> 00:33:10,372
Right? I think so.

737
00:33:10,372 --> 00:33:11,554
Absolutely.

738
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,888
How do you spell 'Kama'?

739
00:33:14,022 --> 00:33:15,513
Dude, babe alert at 3 o'clock.

740
00:33:15,647 --> 00:33:17,513
Three o'clock.
My 3, my 3.

741
00:33:22,647 --> 00:33:23,246
Wait a minute.

742
00:33:23,246 --> 00:33:23,846
That hurls my dink.

743
00:33:23,981 --> 00:33:25,346
Wait a minute. That's Kelly.

744
00:33:25,346 --> 00:33:26,726
Who?

745
00:33:26,726 --> 00:33:28,106
My Realtor.

746
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,721
Oh, shit,
the enemy.

747
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:32,096
Listen to me.
Listen.

748
00:33:32,231 --> 00:33:35,179
We cannot afford to lose the casa
de sex before Labor Day, okay?

749
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:38,263
You go over there,
you get in tight with her, lay on the charm,

750
00:33:38,397 --> 00:33:40,346
and get her to drag ass selling the house.

751
00:33:40,481 --> 00:33:41,804
No, no,
that is... Yes, yes.

752
00:33:41,939 --> 00:33:44,263
She is a tough cookie.
She'll see through that.

753
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,388
Her? Please, dude,
you're the king.

754
00:33:46,522 --> 00:33:49,846
A little winey-diney,
she'll be your humble wench servant.

755
00:33:50,772 --> 00:33:52,804
Keep friends close,
but enemies closer.

756
00:33:52,939 --> 00:33:56,263
Yeah. That doesn't make any sense.
Just go fucking charm her, okay?

757
00:33:56,564 --> 00:33:57,971
Okay.
Go, go, go.

758
00:33:58,106 --> 00:33:59,388
All right.
Do the thing.

759
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:02,804
What? The smile thing.
Ahem.

760
00:34:03,772 --> 00:34:05,371
Kelly. Kelly.

761
00:34:05,371 --> 00:34:06,971
Hi. Oh, Eric.

762
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:10,388
Oh, my God,
look at this. Watch.

763
00:34:10,522 --> 00:34:13,596
I hope anything I said didn't
screw anything up with the client.

764
00:34:13,731 --> 00:34:15,888
I was joking around.
I didn't freak them out?

765
00:34:16,022 --> 00:34:16,872
Oh, no. Not at all.

766
00:34:16,872 --> 00:34:17,721
Oh, good.

767
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:20,596
You were wearing that helmet
so I was able to convince them

768
00:34:20,731 --> 00:34:23,596
that, you know,
you ride the short bus.

769
00:34:24,531 --> 00:34:26,229
Well, that's good.

770
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:27,771
Well played.

771
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:29,471
Hey, do you mind if...?
Maybe I can make up to you.

772
00:34:29,606 --> 00:34:31,429
Take you out to dinner or something?

773
00:34:31,564 --> 00:34:32,517
Could be fun, yeah?

774
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:33,471
Oh, gosh, thanks.

775
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:37,763
Um, technically,
I'm not supposed to go out with clients so..

776
00:34:37,897 --> 00:34:40,846
Well, technically my dad's the client.

777
00:34:40,981 --> 00:34:43,846
Right now I'm just some random dude on the beach.

778
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:46,513
She's smiling. Look, she's smiling.
She's buying it.

779
00:34:46,513 --> 00:34:49,147
Okay. I'll go to dinner with you.

780
00:34:49,147 --> 00:34:50,263
All right.

781
00:34:50,397 --> 00:34:52,596
But, tell me which party we met at.

782
00:34:52,731 --> 00:34:53,830
Was it one of my parties?

783
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:54,929
Mm-hm.

784
00:34:55,064 --> 00:34:56,721
Okay.
What, um...

785
00:34:56,856 --> 00:34:59,263
Oh, was it the Cuba Libre party because

786
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,638
I was in mojito haze that whole day and I just...

787
00:35:01,772 --> 00:35:03,179
Nope.

788
00:35:03,314 --> 00:35:04,679
Oktoberfest in July?

789
00:35:04,772 --> 00:35:05,747
Nope.

790
00:35:05,747 --> 00:35:06,721
Oh, oh, no, no, I know.

791
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:07,971
I know.

792
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,388
Uh, it was the Shir Trek versus Shir
Wars Battle for the Universe Party

793
00:35:11,522 --> 00:35:14,388
and you were dressed as Obi-Wan Kenobi.

794
00:35:14,522 --> 00:35:16,888
How drunk do you get at these parties?

795
00:35:17,022 --> 00:35:19,888
Uh, pretty drunk.
It's kind of a social obligation.

796
00:35:20,022 --> 00:35:22,638
Okay.
I'm gonna give you a hint.

797
00:35:22,772 --> 00:35:24,388
I wear a size 9 shoe.

798
00:35:26,106 --> 00:35:27,846
Oh, my God.

799
00:35:27,981 --> 00:35:30,054
Oh, my God,
you're bean dip girl.

800
00:35:30,189 --> 00:35:31,205
You're bean dip girl?

801
00:35:31,605 --> 00:35:32,621
I am.

802
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:34,471
Have you been bean dip girl the whole time?

803
00:35:34,606 --> 00:35:36,804
Oh, he's so good.

804
00:35:36,939 --> 00:35:39,054
I can't believe that.
I was gonna call you.

805
00:35:39,189 --> 00:35:40,554
I had your number on my hand

806
00:35:40,689 --> 00:35:42,596
and I jumped in the pool and it was gone.

807
00:35:42,731 --> 00:35:45,263
I thought I lost you.
I thought you were gone forever.

808
00:35:45,397 --> 00:35:46,596
And you...

809
00:35:46,731 --> 00:35:48,929
You look so much better without the fake baby.

810
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,679
I actually prefer the mullet.

811
00:35:50,814 --> 00:35:52,179
Oh, I just cut it yesterday.

812
00:35:52,314 --> 00:35:53,554
Oh.
For work.

813
00:35:53,689 --> 00:35:56,721
Don't think this whole funny,
charming thing right now

814
00:35:56,856 --> 00:35:58,679
gets you off for stealing my signs.

815
00:35:58,814 --> 00:36:00,971
I don't know what you're talking about.

816
00:36:01,106 --> 00:36:03,054
I'm furious those signs are gone.

817
00:36:03,189 --> 00:36:04,679
You're lying.
I'm not lying.

818
00:36:04,814 --> 00:36:06,513
Your voice just went up.
What?

819
00:36:07,189 --> 00:36:08,513
I'm a ...

820
00:36:08,513 --> 00:36:11,147
I'm not lying. I am not lying.

821
00:36:11,147 --> 00:36:11,872
You're so lying.

822
00:36:11,872 --> 00:36:12,596
No, I'm not.

823
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,637
Fucking James Bond.
Fuck.

824
00:36:15,981 --> 00:36:19,053
Wow, look at that, huh?

825
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:22,345
Holy smokes.
Another gorgeous shot.

826
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:23,678
Yeah, thanks.

827
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:27,845
What should I use,
pitching wedge or nine?

828
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,095
I used the nine.

829
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:32,720
I think maybe I should use the wedge.

830
00:36:32,856 --> 00:36:34,303
Or use the wedge.

831
00:36:37,523 --> 00:36:39,595
Ugh!
Why am I like this?

832
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:42,970
Oh, just pick a club and hit it.
What is the big deal?

833
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:45,845
Will you do the orgy with me?

834
00:36:47,356 --> 00:36:48,886
Hey, can we play through?

835
00:36:49,023 --> 00:36:50,136
Hold on a second, man.

836
00:36:53,606 --> 00:36:54,845
The orgy

837
00:36:54,981 --> 00:36:57,136
You think that would be a good idea?

838
00:36:58,745 --> 00:37:01,548
I'm stuck.
And I think the reason is

839
00:37:01,548 --> 00:37:03,870
is because I feel like a fucking fraud.

840
00:37:04,006 --> 00:37:07,453
I'm not cool.
I have a law degree.

841
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:10,995
I ride a motorcycle and it scares the fucking shit out of me.

842
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:13,578
And I play golf at my mom's fucking country club

843
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:15,911
with assholes like this.

844
00:37:16,048 --> 00:37:18,745
What's the holdup?
Play the wedge!

845
00:37:19,215 --> 00:37:21,370
This is not rock'n'roll.

846
00:37:22,715 --> 00:37:25,161
This could be really good for me.

847
00:37:25,298 --> 00:37:27,328
For me and for us.

848
00:37:27,965 --> 00:37:30,203
Will you do the orgy with me?

849
00:37:33,006 --> 00:37:35,161
Sure, yeah, yeah, whatever. Yeah.

850
00:37:36,173 --> 00:37:37,495
Really?

851
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,745
Holy shit.
Yeah.

852
00:37:42,423 --> 00:37:45,495
If you're sure this is what you want.

853
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:48,328
Yeah, absolutely.

854
00:37:48,465 --> 00:37:49,563
Good.

855
00:37:49,563 --> 00:37:50,661
I think.

856
00:37:50,798 --> 00:37:52,911
Fore!

857
00:38:00,506 --> 00:38:02,953
So you wanna know why guys don't get as excited

858
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,620
about their wedding as women do?

859
00:38:05,756 --> 00:38:09,286
See, it used to be like a guy would get
rewarded for his commitment with sex.

860
00:38:09,423 --> 00:38:12,120
But you and Glenn have had sex like a billion times.

861
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:14,620
For God's sake,
you guys have a kid together.

862
00:38:14,756 --> 00:38:20,328
So for Glenn,
it's just kind of like all commitment, no reward.

863
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:21,953
You know?

864
00:38:22,548 --> 00:38:25,161
I'm the fucking reward.

865
00:38:25,298 --> 00:38:26,953
Of course you are.
Of course.

866
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,495
Something's wrong.
He's never late.

867
00:38:31,631 --> 00:38:33,661
Try him again.
I have been trying him.

868
00:38:33,798 --> 00:38:35,245
He's not answering his phone.

869
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:37,995
At least he won't wear a white tuxedo like you dickheads.

870
00:38:38,715 --> 00:38:40,786
Oh, God,
that's good.

871
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,745
Oh, sweet Lord in heaven.

872
00:38:45,881 --> 00:38:47,536
What the fuck,
are you stoned?

873
00:38:47,673 --> 00:38:49,911
No.
No, no, no, better.

874
00:38:50,048 --> 00:38:52,703
I'm wearing a thing called The Yank.
From Adam & Eve catalogues.

875
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,745
One end straps around your leg,
the other end around your Wang.

876
00:38:55,881 --> 00:38:59,870
The brochure says, 'With every stride,
it gives your member a gentle tug.'

877
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:04,078
What are you doing with a rope
on your cock at my wedding?

878
00:39:04,215 --> 00:39:06,161
Endurance training,
Labor Day.

879
00:39:07,098 --> 00:39:07,498
For what?

880
00:39:07,498 --> 00:39:08,798
A jack-off marathon?

881
00:39:09,923 --> 00:39:12,161
What?
Uh, yeah.

882
00:39:12,298 --> 00:39:14,953
That's exactly it.
You nailed it. Heh, heh.

883
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,786
Hey, check it out.
Look who's here.

884
00:39:16,923 --> 00:39:19,745
Oh, fantastic.
Another asshole in white tails.

885
00:39:19,881 --> 00:39:22,203
Keep the change, man.

886
00:39:23,298 --> 00:39:25,036
Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, my God.

887
00:39:26,381 --> 00:39:27,870
Well, well, well.
Look at you.

888
00:39:28,006 --> 00:39:31,578
You're late, you're in costume,
and you appear to be hammered.

889
00:39:31,715 --> 00:39:32,911
Who the hell are you?

890
00:39:33,048 --> 00:39:35,203
Long story.
I got fired.

891
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,536
What?

892
00:39:36,673 --> 00:39:40,203
It had more to do with the fact that I
almost blew a $2 billion merger deal

893
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:43,739
because some bozo jumped into the pool
with my blackberry.

894
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:45,639
Oh, shit. Dude.

895
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:47,703
I spent most of last night crying and drinking

896
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:51,703
and then I drunk-dialed my mom.
She kind of talked me down.

897
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,536
Then I woke up this morning,

898
00:39:53,673 --> 00:39:56,828
had a little more to drink and I realized,
you know what?

899
00:39:56,964 --> 00:39:59,036
This is good.
I'm free.

900
00:39:59,173 --> 00:40:00,494
Adam, I'm so sorry.

901
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:02,578
Shh, shh, shush.
You're my friend.

902
00:40:02,714 --> 00:40:04,661
No, they took my twenties from me.

903
00:40:04,798 --> 00:40:07,869
And I plan to make my thirties making up for it.

904
00:40:08,008 --> 00:40:09,659
And you know what else?

905
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:12,925
I'm doing the orgy. Fuck it.

906
00:40:12,925 --> 00:40:13,992
Orgy?

907
00:40:14,133 --> 00:40:15,742
What orgy?

908
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:17,534
The fuck are you talking about?

909
00:40:17,534 --> 00:40:20,550
See, this is exactly why we should have told him, Eric.

910
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,867
Told me what?

911
00:40:22,008 --> 00:40:24,159
That's what we're doing for Labor Day.
An orgy.

912
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,909
Bullshit.
Who's having an orgy?

913
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,367
It's me, Willow,
these two fellas,

914
00:40:29,508 --> 00:40:31,867
Laura, Sue,
now drunkie.

915
00:40:32,008 --> 00:40:33,159
Waiting on Alison.

916
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,326
Jesus H.
Fucking Christ.

917
00:40:35,425 --> 00:40:38,326
How come you cocksuckers didn't
think of this fucking orgy idea

918
00:40:38,466 --> 00:40:40,784
five fucking years ago?
God damn it!

919
00:40:40,925 --> 00:40:42,992
Ahem.
Uh, Glenn.

920
00:40:43,133 --> 00:40:45,826
I'm afraid we're gonna have to start without your friend.

921
00:40:45,966 --> 00:40:47,242
Oh, he's here.
He's, uh...

922
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,438
Hi, Rabbi.

923
00:40:49,925 --> 00:40:51,326
Pardon my French.

924
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,742
All right, everybody.

925
00:40:56,742 --> 00:40:59,550
Introducing for the very first time,

926
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,992
Mr. and Mrs. Glenn Pasillio.

927
00:41:03,466 --> 00:41:05,000
Paciello!

928
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,534
Paciellio.

929
00:41:12,925 --> 00:41:14,076
Here we go.

930
00:41:15,925 --> 00:41:17,117
I am married.

931
00:41:22,742 --> 00:41:27,550
I can't believe that you guys broke up because you shaved.

932
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,492
He's the weirdest,
creepiest guy ever.

933
00:41:27,633 --> 00:41:29,326
Here you are, ladies.

934
00:41:29,466 --> 00:41:31,909
You guys are definitely broken up this time, right?

935
00:41:35,216 --> 00:41:36,617
Fuck relationships.

936
00:41:36,758 --> 00:41:40,576
Right now,
all I wanna do is have some fun.

937
00:42:06,633 --> 00:42:08,492
Labor Day.

938
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,867
I'm in.

939
00:42:10,508 --> 00:42:12,367
Yes.
Yes.

940
00:42:12,508 --> 00:42:14,201
Oh, and I'm fully shaved.

941
00:42:16,008 --> 00:42:16,938
Alison!

942
00:42:16,938 --> 00:42:17,867
Oh, no, no, no.

943
00:42:18,008 --> 00:42:20,034
I'm not making a speech.

944
00:42:20,175 --> 00:42:23,367
Sorry about that. It's, uh,
private conversation.

945
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:30,034
You know what they're doing over Labor Day?
Do you know what the party is?

946
00:42:30,175 --> 00:42:31,284
What?

947
00:42:31,425 --> 00:42:33,867
They're having a fucking orgy.

948
00:42:35,008 --> 00:42:37,242
What are you talking about?

949
00:42:36,383 --> 00:42:38,951
They are having an orgy.

950
00:42:39,758 --> 00:42:40,909
Like a sex orgy?

951
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:43,159
Like a sex orgy and we're not invited.

952
00:42:46,966 --> 00:42:48,367
Hey.
Hi.

953
00:42:48,508 --> 00:42:49,909
So is it true?

954
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:52,284
That all of you are having this orgy

955
00:42:52,425 --> 00:42:54,326
and you didn't think to invite us?

956
00:42:56,466 --> 00:42:59,367
What are you all looking at me for?
I...

957
00:42:59,508 --> 00:43:02,076
Guys, you just got married, okay?

958
00:43:02,216 --> 00:43:04,201
L... You have a kid.
You don't...

959
00:43:04,341 --> 00:43:06,659
Don't you think it's a little inappropriate?

960
00:43:06,799 --> 00:43:08,492
Well, of course we wouldn't come.

961
00:43:08,633 --> 00:43:11,492
It's that you didn't ask us.
You didn't even think of us.

962
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:14,075
In fact,
you specifically hid this from us.

963
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:16,200
We invited all you to be here today,

964
00:43:16,341 --> 00:43:18,700
just the most special day of our lives,

965
00:43:18,841 --> 00:43:22,742
and you,
who are supposed to be our closest friends...

966
00:43:22,883 --> 00:43:25,950
There were family members who
didn't get invited so you could come.

967
00:43:26,091 --> 00:43:26,688
Family members.

968
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:27,284
Right.

969
00:43:28,091 --> 00:43:31,867
Now, we're just totally out of your pervy little social club.
Huh?

970
00:43:32,966 --> 00:43:34,117
I don't believe this.

971
00:43:40,591 --> 00:43:42,784
Sorry.
Are you happy?

972
00:43:44,383 --> 00:43:47,784
Because you and your stupid orgy
just ruined our goddamn wedding.

973
00:43:47,924 --> 00:43:48,958
Oh, come on, Glenn.

974
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:49,992
Kate!

975
00:43:50,258 --> 00:43:51,958
Is it too late to invite them?

976
00:43:51,958 --> 00:43:52,784
I'll go talk to her.

977
00:43:52,924 --> 00:43:53,992
No!

978
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:55,104
Are you kidding me?

979
00:43:55,104 --> 00:43:56,075
Guys, it's Katie.

980
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:57,867
She's gonna be fine in like an hour.

981
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:00,484
I just realized I'm really hammered

982
00:43:59,924 --> 00:44:02,034
and I would really like to dance.

983
00:44:02,174 --> 00:44:03,534
I'm dancing too.

984
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:06,450
This reminds me of our senior prom.

985
00:44:06,591 --> 00:44:08,617
You still won't give me a hand job, right?

986
00:44:29,549 --> 00:44:33,649
It's amazing that you're still so
tight with all your high school friends.

987
00:44:33,649 --> 00:44:35,246
None of mine moved back after college.

988
00:44:35,379 --> 00:44:38,246
Yeah, it's a, uh... I don't know,
it's maybe corny to say,

989
00:44:38,379 --> 00:44:40,288
but these guys and gals are kind of like

990
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,954
the closest thing I've got to a family these days.

991
00:44:43,087 --> 00:44:46,246
That's why the house, the summer house,
it's like our rec center.

992
00:44:46,712 --> 00:44:49,038
I think we're getting an offer on the rec center.

993
00:44:50,376 --> 00:44:51,776
My dad will be thrilled.

994
00:44:51,792 --> 00:44:52,499
I knew it.

995
00:44:52,499 --> 00:44:53,207
What?

996
00:44:53,334 --> 00:44:55,791
I knew it wasn't a family decision to sell the house.

997
00:44:55,917 --> 00:44:59,249
No.
We're not big into family decisions any more.

998
00:44:59,376 --> 00:45:01,666
My mom,
she lives in Portland, Oregon,

999
00:45:01,792 --> 00:45:04,957
with this, uh,
Reiki healer asshole.

1000
00:45:05,084 --> 00:45:06,416
Tell me exactly how you feel.

1001
00:45:06,416 --> 00:45:07,749
Oh, he's good. He's good.

1002
00:45:07,876 --> 00:45:10,499
Uh, no,
she's kind of out of the picture.

1003
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:13,249
Her doing. Um, yeah,
it's just me and my dad.

1004
00:45:13,376 --> 00:45:16,576
Hm, well,
your dad seems like a fun guy.

1005
00:45:17,207 --> 00:45:19,542
Yeah, yeah, he's very fun. He's a hoot.

1006
00:45:19,542 --> 00:45:22,374
Kind of like being raised by an older fraternity brother.

1007
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:23,792
He hit on me a little bit.

1008
00:45:23,792 --> 00:45:25,082
No.

1009
00:45:25,209 --> 00:45:26,291
He ask you to play golf?

1010
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:27,374
Yes.

1011
00:45:27,501 --> 00:45:29,832
That's his move.
He's very good at golf. Very good.

1012
00:45:29,959 --> 00:45:33,166
But he did it right in front of Cherie and she had no idea.

1013
00:45:33,292 --> 00:45:34,874
Neither did my mom for a while.

1014
00:45:35,209 --> 00:45:37,166
Now if you will excuse me, Oh.

1015
00:45:37,292 --> 00:45:39,249
I have to win this game if you don't mind.

1016
00:45:39,376 --> 00:45:40,750
Does this make you...?

1017
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:42,124
It's a little distracting.

1018
00:45:42,251 --> 00:45:43,250
That's not distracting at all.

1019
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:44,249
Oh! Jesus.

1020
00:45:44,376 --> 00:45:46,749
I lied.
It was a little distracting.

1021
00:45:46,876 --> 00:45:48,082
Help.

1022
00:45:50,959 --> 00:45:54,124
Fred's Beds?
Are you sure this is the right place?

1023
00:45:54,459 --> 00:45:58,207
Yeah. What do you they gonna do,
putting sign on underground sex club?

1024
00:45:58,834 --> 00:46:00,499
He said come in through the warehouse entrance.

1025
00:46:01,334 --> 00:46:02,541
Hey, you got rubbers on you?

1026
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:03,208
No!

1027
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:03,749
What?

1028
00:46:03,749 --> 00:46:04,349
No, no, no.

1029
00:46:04,349 --> 00:46:05,874
We are here strictly to observe.
That is all.

1030
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:07,901
Dude, it's a sex club. <i>Semper fi.</i>

1031
00:46:07,901 --> 00:46:09,646
Always prepared.
You know what I mean?

1032
00:46:09,646 --> 00:46:11,041
Doesn't that mean 'always faithful'?

1033
00:46:11,167 --> 00:46:13,291
Hey, who took Latin in seventh grade?

1034
00:46:13,417 --> 00:46:14,417
Moi, okay?

1035
00:46:15,517 --> 00:46:17,807
I brought a pack with me if you need one.

1036
00:46:16,834 --> 00:46:17,770
Give me the signal.

1037
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:18,707
I won't need one.

1038
00:46:18,707 --> 00:46:19,307
Altoid?

1039
00:46:19,307 --> 00:46:20,007
Yeah.

1040
00:46:25,001 --> 00:46:26,082
What do you want?

1041
00:46:26,082 --> 00:46:27,482
The password is chandelier.

1042
00:46:31,142 --> 00:46:31,942
Who's your connection?

1043
00:46:31,942 --> 00:46:33,142
Vic George, friend of my uncle's.

1044
00:46:33,142 --> 00:46:35,242
Oh yeah. He told me to expect you.

1045
00:46:35,242 --> 00:46:36,242
Come on in.

1046
00:46:40,225 --> 00:46:43,099
So welcome to the Paradiso.

1047
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:48,209
What the fuck?

1048
00:46:48,209 --> 00:46:49,609
I, I don't know.

1049
00:46:50,292 --> 00:46:51,292
Can I take your clothes?

1050
00:46:51,292 --> 00:46:51,892
No.

1051
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:52,492
You sure?

1052
00:46:52,492 --> 00:46:53,124
Good, we're good.

1053
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:53,950
Okay, follow me.

1054
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:54,550
Yeah.

1055
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:56,450
This is Bill.

1056
00:46:57,875 --> 00:46:59,075
That was a panda.

1057
00:46:59,075 --> 00:47:00,475
Go easy on that thing.

1058
00:47:00,475 --> 00:47:02,275
Didi, Ginger.

1059
00:47:03,982 --> 00:47:05,942
Clambake.

1060
00:47:05,442 --> 00:47:06,959
This group right here.

1061
00:47:07,459 --> 00:47:10,499
Get in the swing, rock your world.

1062
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:11,567
My grandma has that thing.

1063
00:47:12,067 --> 00:47:14,467
You need anything,
just ask for Fred.

1064
00:47:14,467 --> 00:47:15,367
Oh, Fred's Beds?

1065
00:47:15,367 --> 00:47:16,567
Oh no, that's a different Fred.

1066
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:17,767
I'm a dentist.

1067
00:47:17,967 --> 00:47:21,132
Vic, he is over there in the futon section.
All right?

1068
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:21,162
Okay.

1069
00:47:21,162 --> 00:47:21,765
Have a good time.

1070
00:47:21,892 --> 00:47:22,433
Thank you.

1071
00:47:22,433 --> 00:47:22,974
Thanks, Dr. Fred.

1072
00:47:24,392 --> 00:47:25,992
Should've had this guy at the wedding.

1073
00:47:28,334 --> 00:47:29,707
Love the new <i>Price is Right</i>.

1074
00:47:30,707 --> 00:47:31,943
There he is, there he is.

1075
00:47:31,943 --> 00:47:33,180
Oh my god.

1076
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,020
Hey, Mikey!

1077
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,320
Little McCrudden.

1078
00:47:36,502 --> 00:47:39,102
Holy shit,
you've grown.

1079
00:47:39,102 --> 00:47:39,661
How you doing, baby?

1080
00:47:39,661 --> 00:47:40,220
Good, good.

1081
00:47:42,502 --> 00:47:43,711
How's your folks?

1082
00:47:43,711 --> 00:47:44,920
Good, they're on a cruise

1083
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,780
Mom got her pound cake recipe published.

1084
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,250
This is my buddy Eric.

1085
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:49,320
Eric, Vic.

1086
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,720
First time at the Paradise, ha? Eh, boys?

1087
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,920
Come on, guys,
take off the clothes and get fucking.

1088
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,820
No. No fucking. No. Actually, no,
no. We're here more doing research

1089
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,120
than anything else.
We're gonna throw an orgy.

1090
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,720
We were hoping we can get a little advice from you.

1091
00:48:02,502 --> 00:48:03,720
Just let me finish up here.

1092
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,520
No rush. Take your time.

1093
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,420
No, you can rush if you want.

1094
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,420
You rush a little.

1095
00:48:07,002 --> 00:48:09,002
Not much longer guys,
Hang in will you.

1096
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,280
Look at me, not her.

1097
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:13,480
Look at me!

1098
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,520
I'm not gonna look at him.

1099
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,720
Do me a favor,
count me down.

1100
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,980
Five, four, three...

1101
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:20,880
Go back to 10!

1102
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,380
Ten, nine, eight...

1103
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,080
Oh! Your mom's a good woman.

1104
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,080
You're little early on that one.

1105
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,620
Holy shit,
I got a second one.

1106
00:48:35,102 --> 00:48:37,720
So Vic, we could really use your expertise.

1107
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,720
How do we make sure that the women are into it?

1108
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,420
Don't worry about the women,
worry about you guys.

1109
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,720
Okay, so how do we make it happen, Vic?

1110
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,720
Just because you have a bunch
of naked people in the room

1111
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,920
doesn't mean you're all going to get it on.

1112
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,220
Sometimes a girl just wants to have a heart-to-heart,

1113
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,320
and she ends up pulling a train.

1114
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,520
Pulling a train?

1115
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,980
Mm, yeah, you know.

1116
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,020
Choo-choo train.

1117
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,820
Here's another thing.

1118
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,420
Every wolf pack has a leader.
I take it you're the lead wolf?

1119
00:49:12,415 --> 00:49:13,065
Fucking A.

1120
00:49:13,065 --> 00:49:16,020
 Uh, yes. I guess so. Yes.

1121
00:49:17,102 --> 00:49:20,120
Well, then it's all on your shoulders.

1122
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:23,420
If you don't run,
nobody behind you can run.

1123
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,950
Oh, that's good.

1124
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:26,020
What does that mean? What do I do?

1125
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,220
You have to get naked.

1126
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,120
You've got get naked in your mind,
in your heart, in your soul.

1127
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,220
You've got be honest with yourself 
and everybody else

1128
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,020
about what you want.
If you're a pegger, be honest about that.

1129
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,820
What is a pegger?

1130
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,220
Chick fucks a dude up the ass with a strap-on.

1131
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,520
Not really my bag,
but like I always say,

1132
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,520
I'm willing to try anything twice.

1133
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,050
Hello, senator.

1134
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:57,820
Hello.

1135
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:01,720
This is a lot to process.

1136
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,120
You listen to me.

1137
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:07,320
You can't force it and you can't fake it.

1138
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:13,720
So you better cut the bullshit,
nut up, and be a man.

1139
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,620
Now if you'll excuse me,

1140
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,220
I feel the blood rushing back to my sword.

1141
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,320
I noticed that.

1142
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,620
Well, hey, Vic, thank you.
This is all good stuff.

1143
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,600
Good advice.

1144
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,320
Yeah. Good. 
Thank you.

1145
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,220
My pleasure, guys.

1146
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,520
Oh there, watch that thing.

1147
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,420
Good luck.

1148
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:37,820
Okay. We should probably leave now.

1149
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,150
Don't eat anything here.

1150
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,050
You son of a bitch.

1151
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:41,620
Don't!

1152
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:48,880
Holy shit, is that...?

1153
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,480
Yeah, yeah, keep going.

1154
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,620
Don't let her see you.

1155
00:50:52,658 --> 00:50:54,958
Oh. Man, oh, man. All right.

1156
00:50:54,958 --> 00:50:55,558
That was good?

1157
00:50:55,558 --> 00:50:56,990
That was good.
That was pretty good.

1158
00:50:57,117 --> 00:50:58,282
Yeah, okay,
here we go.

1159
00:50:58,282 --> 00:50:58,882
You ready?

1160
00:50:58,882 --> 00:50:59,882
Showtime.

1161
00:51:02,742 --> 00:51:03,492
Shit!

1162
00:51:03,992 --> 00:51:04,792
I'm gonna count that.

1163
00:51:04,792 --> 00:51:05,392
Okay.

1164
00:51:05,392 --> 00:51:06,252
I'm gonna count that there.

1165
00:51:06,252 --> 00:51:06,922
Okay.

1166
00:51:07,542 --> 00:51:10,102
.. yeah, it's juvenile.
I've been meaning to ask you something.

1167
00:51:10,102 --> 00:51:10,662
What?

1168
00:51:10,662 --> 00:51:12,957
What's Dody like as a boss?

1169
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:16,748
She just seems like she could be a little,
you know, domineering.

1170
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:20,665
Oh, my gosh, no. I mean,
she's not what you think, you know.

1171
00:51:20,792 --> 00:51:23,123
I mean, of course,
at work she's all business,

1172
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,582
but, Eric,
she has traveled the world.

1173
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:27,998
She speaks all these languages.

1174
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:30,623
She's just full of surprises.

1175
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,332
Oh, I bet she is.

1176
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:34,582
I bet she's been places I can only imagine.

1177
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:37,748
So, like,
now that you're super into me...

1178
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:42,165
No, there's something I actually have to tell you.

1179
00:51:42,292 --> 00:51:43,041
Sincerely I, um...

1180
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:43,790
Really?

1181
00:51:43,917 --> 00:51:45,915
Yeah, I kind of misled you. Uh...

1182
00:51:46,042 --> 00:51:50,957
What you saw today was not an actual
representation of my Frisbee golf skills.

1183
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:53,248
Yeah.
I let you win.

1184
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:54,229
Really?

1185
00:51:54,229 --> 00:51:55,082
Yeah.

1186
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:57,248
So I want a rematch.
Like, big time.

1187
00:51:58,083 --> 00:52:00,582
Or you could just stick to sucking at pool.

1188
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:02,748
Ooh.

1189
00:52:02,875 --> 00:52:03,675
Sss!

1190
00:52:03,675 --> 00:52:05,082
Oh.

1191
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:11,540
One more.

1192
00:52:11,667 --> 00:52:12,217
That's it, though.

1193
00:52:12,217 --> 00:52:12,817
No.

1194
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:15,165
That was the last one.
That's for the road.

1195
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,373
I will call you.

1196
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:17,408
Okay.

1197
00:52:17,408 --> 00:52:18,258
All right.

1198
00:52:18,658 --> 00:52:19,508
See you!

1199
00:52:20,008 --> 00:52:21,708
Hey! Umm..

1200
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,373
What are you doing for Labor Day?

1201
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,832
Oh, yeah. Is that...?
Yeah, Labor Day.

1202
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:29,790
Um, you know what?

1203
00:52:29,917 --> 00:52:32,665
The guys and the crew,
we're all gonna, um...

1204
00:52:32,792 --> 00:52:34,707
We're doing this small little thing,

1205
00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:37,373
this intimate little thing.
Nothing... Nothing special.

1206
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,040
Well, I was thinking that maybe,
you know,

1207
00:52:40,167 --> 00:52:42,873
your friends and my friends could get together.

1208
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,290
Yeah.

1209
00:52:44,417 --> 00:52:45,317
Oh, that sounds great.

1210
00:52:45,317 --> 00:52:45,873
Yeah?

1211
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,957
Yeah, we should definitely look into that,
maybe.

1212
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:49,540
Yeah.
It'd be fun.

1213
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:52,457
But, so, wait, Eric, is that...?
Is that a maybe?

1214
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:55,707
Yeah, it's a maybe. It's a definite maybe.
It's a hard, hard maybe.

1215
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:57,915
We should definitely think about doing that.

1216
00:52:58,042 --> 00:53:00,332
Let's lock it in as a possibility.

1217
00:53:00,458 --> 00:53:01,707
Okay.

1218
00:53:01,833 --> 00:53:04,123
I'll call you about it.

1219
00:53:04,123 --> 00:53:05,542
Or write you.

1220
00:53:05,542 --> 00:53:07,373
Heh, okay.

1221
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,500
Carrier pigeon. Something.
I'll get a hold of you.

1222
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,832
Okay, Good night, Eric.

1223
00:53:10,832 --> 00:53:11,707
Good night, Kelly.

1224
00:53:30,667 --> 00:53:31,791
What are you doing up?

1225
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:32,915
Oh, I never went down.

1226
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:36,540
Stayed up drinking with a dude from
Blues Traveler in the Talkhouse parking lot.

1227
00:53:36,667 --> 00:53:40,873
Like an hour ago,
fucking dude says the bubonic plague is back.

1228
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,290
Great.
Another thing to worry about.

1229
00:53:44,833 --> 00:53:46,457
What are you doing up?

1230
00:53:46,792 --> 00:53:49,332
I got a bit of a situation.

1231
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:51,290
Hit me.

1232
00:53:51,417 --> 00:53:55,123
Okay, but first off,
you can't tell anyone.

1233
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:57,082
Dude, look who you're talking to.

1234
00:53:57,208 --> 00:53:58,103
It's the vault.

1235
00:53:58,103 --> 00:53:58,998
Seriously.

1236
00:53:59,125 --> 00:54:01,540
A lot of people tell people you can't tell someone,

1237
00:54:01,667 --> 00:54:04,623
and those people go and tell someone.
That cannot happen this time.

1238
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:07,123
Hey!
You tell no one.

1239
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:08,956
Not even Rodrigo?

1240
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:12,456
Why would you tell a 50-year-old
Guatemalan landscaper about my life?

1241
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:15,165
Because he's a good sounding board, okay?

1242
00:54:15,291 --> 00:54:18,498
But if you're gonna get all weird about it,
I won't tell Rodrigo.

1243
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:20,665
I appreciate it.

1244
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:23,498
I went on a date last night.

1245
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:24,915
So far,
so good.

1246
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:26,123
With the Realtor chick.

1247
00:54:27,083 --> 00:54:28,623
Dody Henderson?
Did she peg you?

1248
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:31,581
No, not Dody.
I went out with Kelly.

1249
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:32,915
Oh, thank the Lord.

1250
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:35,081
I felt bad for your butt hole for a minute.

1251
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:35,749
Heh, heh.

1252
00:54:35,749 --> 00:54:36,290
Yeah.

1253
00:54:36,416 --> 00:54:40,665
Yeah, and I think we've got a problem because

1254
00:54:41,541 --> 00:54:43,248
I really kind of dig her now.

1255
00:54:44,875 --> 00:54:47,248
I don't know what to do about the orgy situation.

1256
00:54:47,375 --> 00:54:48,790
Are you fucking with me right now?

1257
00:54:48,916 --> 00:54:51,081
I know.
What are the odds?

1258
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:52,998
I mean, seriously,
I'm smack dab

1259
00:54:53,125 --> 00:54:54,831
in the middle of organizing an orgy.

1260
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:55,645
Orgy, yeah.

1261
00:54:55,645 --> 00:54:56,331
Yes. Yeah.

1262
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:59,358
And I meet the first girl in a long time that

1263
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:01,623
I can see myself having a relationship with.

1264
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:05,256
I got tell her about the orgy right?

1265
00:55:04,583 --> 00:55:06,540
What?
Ha-ha-ha!

1266
00:55:06,666 --> 00:55:09,040
No. No.
It's so stupid.

1267
00:55:09,166 --> 00:55:11,456
No. Listen to me.
No, no.

1268
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:15,123
You don't ever, ever,
ever tell her about our little soiree here.

1269
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:16,706
Ever.

1270
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:18,373
Have you perked her yet?

1271
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,873
Oh, goddamn it, Mike.
I hate when you say stuff.

1272
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,081
No.
No, we've kissed.

1273
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:24,956
Kissed, good.
Okay, good.

1274
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:27,540
Keep it PG until after Labor Day, okay?

1275
00:55:27,666 --> 00:55:31,081
As long as you haven't had the exclusivity talk,
and you're not currently boning...

1276
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:31,808
Yeah, I know.

1277
00:55:31,808 --> 00:55:33,040
Then you, my friend,

1278
00:55:33,166 --> 00:55:34,373
are a free agent.

1279
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,498
Mm, I don't know, dude.

1280
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:40,706
Listen to me.
You do not know what or who

1281
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:42,748
she's been doing in her free time, ace.

1282
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:46,081
So just keep it in your pants until <i>après</i> Labor Day

1283
00:55:46,208 --> 00:55:47,873
and then it'll just be this crazy,

1284
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,165
wet, vivid, erotic

1285
00:55:51,291 --> 00:55:54,665
sexual misadventure in your past

1286
00:55:54,791 --> 00:55:57,665
that you never have to tell her about.

1287
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:03,040
Okay...

1288
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:04,066
Okay?

1289
00:56:04,066 --> 00:56:05,266
All right, that's the plan.

1290
00:56:05,266 --> 00:56:08,541
Thank you. That was oddly helpful.

1291
00:56:08,541 --> 00:56:11,498
I am not just a pretty face.

1292
00:56:12,833 --> 00:56:14,248
Oof, ma goof.

1293
00:56:14,375 --> 00:56:16,456
Daddy really needs to get in shape.

1294
00:56:16,583 --> 00:56:18,665
Oh, I'm with you.
I may even cut out curbs,

1295
00:56:18,791 --> 00:56:21,248
except for pizza and sandwiches, obviously.

1296
00:56:21,916 --> 00:56:25,790
Are you guys worried at all about
performing in front of everyone else?

1297
00:56:26,458 --> 00:56:28,498
Look, it's not a race.

1298
00:56:28,625 --> 00:56:30,706
Well, assuming that we can all get wood,

1299
00:56:30,833 --> 00:56:32,623
one of us will have the smallest dick.

1300
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:35,665
And I, for one,
do not wanna have the smallest dick.

1301
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:36,873
Okay.
Two things.

1302
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,623
First off, the ladies are gonna be too concerned
about their bodies to think about yours.

1303
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:43,123
And secondly,
that's all myth.

1304
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,790
Women do not care about penis size.

1305
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:48,373
Who do you think has the biggest dick?

1306
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,623
I think I know.

1307
00:56:50,375 --> 00:56:53,456
Boom. Ah! You're next, Uncle Addie.

1308
00:56:53,456 --> 00:56:55,541
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

1309
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:58,331
No one fucking said anything
about giving any fucking blood.

1310
00:56:58,458 --> 00:56:58,908
Oops.

1311
00:56:58,908 --> 00:56:59,790
And can someone explain to me

1312
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:03,956
why they need to puncture your vein to find
out if there's a problem with your shvantz?

1313
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:06,373
Summer after freshman year,

1314
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,000
Yeah?

1315
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,456
I walked in on one of the guys

1316
00:57:10,583 --> 00:57:12,540
whacking off.

1317
00:57:12,666 --> 00:57:13,749
Shut up. Who?

1318
00:57:13,749 --> 00:57:14,831
I won't say.

1319
00:57:14,958 --> 00:57:16,373
No, no, no, who?
Who? Who?

1320
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:22,123
I'm not gonna tell you,
but I will say that it was a monster.

1321
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,956
Hey.
That is my blood.

1322
00:57:25,083 --> 00:57:26,581
That used to be inside you.

1323
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:27,831
I'm gonna lie down.

1324
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:29,623
What?
Duquez, Duquez!

1325
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,748
You got give us ballpark... Right, right.

1326
00:57:31,874 --> 00:57:32,914
Like is that...?

1327
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:35,289
It's more like...
It was like that.

1328
00:57:35,416 --> 00:57:36,831
What?
But the head.

1329
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:38,539
What?
It's even bigger.

1330
00:57:38,666 --> 00:57:39,914
Mama likes.

1331
00:57:40,041 --> 00:57:41,914
I don't know if you're gonna like it.

1332
00:57:43,999 --> 00:57:46,373
Oh, hi.

1333
00:57:46,499 --> 00:57:47,748
Eric?

1334
00:57:47,874 --> 00:57:50,164
Kelly.
Uh, we're just heading back to the city.

1335
00:57:50,291 --> 00:57:51,491
Yeah, we'll be in touch this week.

1336
00:57:51,491 --> 00:57:52,123
Good.

1337
00:57:52,249 --> 00:57:53,331
Regarding the house.

1338
00:57:53,458 --> 00:57:56,373
Of course, the house, yes.
Yeah, I'll page you.

1339
00:57:58,833 --> 00:58:00,041
Dody.

1340
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:01,248
Eric.

1341
00:58:01,374 --> 00:58:03,289
The password this week is unicorn.

1342
00:58:04,416 --> 00:58:06,498
Well, I don't know if that'll be nece...

1343
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:24,956
We're here to share <i>our</i> experiences

1344
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:28,873
<i>in creating the perfect orgy of your personal fantasies.</i>

1345
00:58:34,289 --> 00:58:37,041
See that?
Everybody's always touching two people.

1346
00:58:36,541 --> 00:58:38,331
A little teamwork over there.

1347
00:58:38,458 --> 00:58:40,039
They're playing good team ball.

1348
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:42,498
Okay, I think we get the picture.

1349
00:58:49,541 --> 00:58:51,289
McCrudds, you want some pizza?

1350
00:58:51,416 --> 00:58:53,081
No, I'm not hungry.
Thank you.

1351
00:58:53,205 --> 00:58:55,334
Got an all-I-can-eat buffet going right here.

1352
00:58:58,955 --> 00:59:00,334
What is that?

1353
00:59:03,205 --> 00:59:04,103
<i>Oh!</i>

1354
00:59:04,103 --> 00:59:05,001
<i>Shit!</i>

1355
00:59:05,121 --> 00:59:07,501
Oh, he's doing my move.
Look at that.

1356
00:59:07,621 --> 00:59:09,667
He knows the Thoosh.

1357
00:59:12,538 --> 00:59:13,834
Hey, you guys?
Guys.

1358
00:59:13,955 --> 00:59:18,292
Back to the music. Are we...?
Are we really gonna listen to Indian the whole night?

1359
00:59:18,413 --> 00:59:19,790
I think it might get a little...

1360
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:21,167
Cab ride-y? Agreed. Yeah.

1361
00:59:21,288 --> 00:59:23,626
I'm working on a killer playlist right now.

1362
00:59:23,746 --> 00:59:25,459
Got some obscure Radiohead.

1363
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:27,667
Who has sex to Radiohead?

1364
00:59:27,788 --> 00:59:29,667
Thom Yorke.

1365
00:59:29,788 --> 00:59:31,209
No Radiohead.
No Radiohead.

1366
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:34,501
I think we need something sensual,
like Sting.

1367
00:59:34,621 --> 00:59:35,332
I love Sting.

1368
00:59:35,332 --> 00:59:36,042
No. No. No.

1369
00:59:36,163 --> 00:59:38,459
Unacceptable.
Absolutely not fucking Sting.

1370
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:41,292
That's bullshit, man.
If Sting comes on the fucking stereo,

1371
00:59:41,413 --> 00:59:42,917
guess who's walking.
This guy.

1372
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:45,126
Sting, it is then.

1373
00:59:50,696 --> 00:59:52,034
got you a little present.

1374
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:52,698
Really?

1375
00:59:52,698 --> 00:59:53,242
Mm-hm.

1376
00:59:53,571 --> 00:59:56,242
It's filled with some great things for next weekend.

1377
00:59:56,363 --> 00:59:58,492
It's not my birthday.
Oh.

1378
00:59:59,946 --> 01:00:03,534
Look, oh, boy. Oh, wow. Look at that guy.
He's like a Swiss Army dude.

1379
01:00:03,655 --> 01:00:05,951
Wow, that's great.
People are gonna love that.

1380
01:00:06,067 --> 01:00:07,067
Just so you know...

1381
01:00:07,067 --> 01:00:07,667
Mm-hm?

1382
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:10,663
I'm not wearing any underwear right now.

1383
01:00:10,776 --> 01:00:12,205
Ew, on these stools?

1384
01:00:12,205 --> 01:00:14,234
Well, well, well, the gang's all here.

1385
01:00:14,234 --> 01:00:15,996
Paciellio!

1386
01:00:16,109 --> 01:00:17,663
Hi.
Paciellio.

1387
01:00:19,026 --> 01:00:19,948
Hi, guys.

1388
01:00:19,948 --> 01:00:20,871
What's up?

1389
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:22,830
We have some business to discuss.

1390
01:00:22,942 --> 01:00:28,621
Right.
So Glenn and I have talked it over and...

1391
01:00:29,734 --> 01:00:32,205
we would like to be included in the orgy.

1392
01:00:33,734 --> 01:00:35,746
We're in.

1393
01:00:35,859 --> 01:00:36,996
We wanna do it.

1394
01:00:40,026 --> 01:00:41,996
Um...

1395
01:00:43,692 --> 01:00:44,788
No.

1396
01:00:44,901 --> 01:00:46,080
Why not?
What... What?

1397
01:00:46,192 --> 01:00:48,080
We already lined up my folks to babysit.

1398
01:00:48,526 --> 01:00:52,038
Guys, guys,
as a friend and a mental-health professional,

1399
01:00:52,151 --> 01:00:53,996
I think it is a horrible, horrible idea.

1400
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:56,246
If you feel disconnected from the group,
I can understand...

1401
01:00:56,359 --> 01:00:59,080
Alison, with all due respect,

1402
01:00:59,192 --> 01:01:01,579
you're an MA,
I'm an MD.

1403
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,454
You're a podiatrist.

1404
01:01:03,567 --> 01:01:05,288
Okay, let's take a vote.

1405
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,800
How many people want us in?

1406
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:07,704
Right.

1407
01:01:07,817 --> 01:01:10,996
I would just like to say that I think
they maybe have a point here.

1408
01:01:11,109 --> 01:01:14,454
Just because they have a baby
doesn't mean we should discriminate them.

1409
01:01:14,567 --> 01:01:17,788
Plus, Kate's rack is killer right now.

1410
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,538
Thank you, Michael. Yeah.

1411
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:23,204
Jesus, Mike,
are you insane? No. No, no.

1412
01:01:23,317 --> 01:01:26,246
Dude, dude, dude, 10 o'clock.
Ten o'clock. My 10, my 10.

1413
01:01:27,484 --> 01:01:28,871
Shit.

1414
01:01:28,984 --> 01:01:31,704
Hey!
Look who it is.

1415
01:01:31,817 --> 01:01:33,371
Hi, there it is.

1416
01:01:33,484 --> 01:01:35,413
Hey, uh,
this is my Realtor, Kelly.

1417
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,288
This is the group,
the gang.

1418
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,079
Hi, Kelly.

1419
01:01:39,192 --> 01:01:41,621
Gosh, I've heard so much about all of you guys.

1420
01:01:41,734 --> 01:01:43,288
How?
When?

1421
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,719
What? Why? What's she hiking about?

1422
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:46,038
Let's get a drink shall we?

1423
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:47,829
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1424
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,746
You think we couldn't handle this because we're parents?

1425
01:01:51,859 --> 01:01:54,913
Well, we can handle shit that you can't even imagine.

1426
01:01:55,025 --> 01:01:57,663
You know,
you motherfuckers have no idea.

1427
01:01:57,775 --> 01:01:58,469
That's right.

1428
01:01:58,469 --> 01:01:59,163
No idea.

1429
01:01:59,275 --> 01:02:00,386
Come on.

1430
01:02:00,386 --> 01:02:01,496
You... You...

1431
01:02:01,609 --> 01:02:03,663
You're all lightweights

1432
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:06,621
You are all playing JV ball.

1433
01:02:06,734 --> 01:02:07,282
Lightweights!

1434
01:02:07,282 --> 01:02:07,829
Whoa!

1435
01:02:07,942 --> 01:02:08,907
All right, Glenn.

1436
01:02:08,907 --> 01:02:09,871
Come on, honey.

1437
01:02:10,859 --> 01:02:14,204
On a lighter note,
I have this present.

1438
01:02:16,609 --> 01:02:17,829
Dildos!

1439
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:20,913
You know, in a pinch,
this would be great for a toothbrush.

1440
01:02:23,775 --> 01:02:25,371
And I have no idea what this is.

1441
01:02:25,484 --> 01:02:27,829
Hey, Eric,
what's up with all the dildos?

1442
01:02:27,942 --> 01:02:30,996
Hey, those are my friends, lady.
Hey, what's going on with the house?

1443
01:02:31,109 --> 01:02:35,913
Um, I've been able to slow things down
to buy you till the end of the summer.

1444
01:02:36,442 --> 01:02:37,240
Really?

1445
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,038
Yeah.

1446
01:02:38,734 --> 01:02:40,788
Oh, you're the best.

1447
01:02:43,067 --> 01:02:44,454
Thank you so much.

1448
01:02:44,567 --> 01:02:45,365
What is that?

1449
01:02:45,365 --> 01:02:46,163
What? What?

1450
01:02:46,275 --> 01:02:47,073
What's going on?

1451
01:02:47,073 --> 01:02:47,871
Nothing.

1452
01:02:47,984 --> 01:02:49,788
No, he told me not to tell anybody so...

1453
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:50,594
Yeah, okay.

1454
01:02:50,594 --> 01:02:51,288
You know.

1455
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,219
Keep it on the down-low.

1456
01:02:53,219 --> 01:02:54,038
Yeah.

1457
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:55,996
He asked her out to get them to shill.

1458
01:02:56,109 --> 01:02:57,746
Went on a couple dates,
he start likes her,

1459
01:02:57,859 --> 01:03:01,413
decide doesn't want to sleep with her before
the orgy because it's wrong to do both.

1460
01:03:01,525 --> 01:03:03,454
Oh.
He doesn't wanna sleep with her.

1461
01:03:03,567 --> 01:03:05,788
That actually means he likes her.

1462
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:06,427
Oh.

1463
01:03:06,427 --> 01:03:06,954
Awesome.

1464
01:03:07,067 --> 01:03:08,788
Hey.
Dildo wave.

1465
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:10,954
Hi.

1466
01:03:29,025 --> 01:03:30,621
Phew!

1467
01:03:30,734 --> 01:03:33,371
Yo, maharajah,
wanna get my back for me?

1468
01:03:33,484 --> 01:03:35,663
What is this shit?
Self tanner, man.

1469
01:03:35,775 --> 01:03:37,663
I wanna look like a porn star.

1470
01:03:37,775 --> 01:03:40,163
Fuck me,
I just stroked out my third batch <i>du jour.</i>

1471
01:03:40,276 --> 01:03:44,078
You boys might wanna do the same.
Don't wanna come quick like a bunch of amateurs.

1472
01:03:44,193 --> 01:03:47,078
Oh, God.
I am not touching you.

1473
01:03:47,985 --> 01:03:50,078
Ah, fuck it.
I'm gonna whack it again.

1474
01:03:50,195 --> 01:03:52,993
You look so pretty.
So do you.

1475
01:03:53,112 --> 01:03:54,201
Thank you.

1476
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,743
I love it.

1477
01:03:55,862 --> 01:03:57,493
Consider yourself warned.

1478
01:03:57,612 --> 01:04:01,035
This absinthe is the real deal.
I had it flown in from Amsterdam.

1479
01:04:01,153 --> 01:04:05,368
The guy that sold it to me said it's the same stuff
Van Gogh was on when he cut his ear off.

1480
01:04:05,487 --> 01:04:06,094
Oh, no.

1481
01:04:06,094 --> 01:04:06,701
Uh-oh.

1482
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:08,618
It's gonna be a starry night, huh?

1483
01:04:08,737 --> 01:04:09,910
It smells like licorice.

1484
01:04:10,028 --> 01:04:12,410
A toast.
A toast.

1485
01:04:12,528 --> 01:04:14,076
To friends.

1486
01:04:14,195 --> 01:04:15,618
To friends.

1487
01:04:15,737 --> 01:04:19,868
And to making sweet love with, to, near...

1488
01:04:19,987 --> 01:04:20,636
On.

1489
01:04:20,636 --> 01:04:21,285
In.

1490
01:04:21,403 --> 01:04:23,535
Under.
And behind.

1491
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:27,618
All right, <i>salud.</i>

1492
01:04:30,903 --> 01:04:32,534
Hagalaka.

1493
01:04:32,653 --> 01:04:34,701
Whoo! Sober.
Never more

1494
01:04:42,986 --> 01:04:44,701
The pillows look really nice.

1495
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,159
Yeah.

1496
01:04:46,278 --> 01:04:48,243
These Crate and Barrel or...?

1497
01:04:56,778 --> 01:04:57,868
You guys look great.

1498
01:04:57,986 --> 01:04:59,159
Oh, thanks.

1499
01:04:59,278 --> 01:05:00,659
You look so fucking hot.

1500
01:05:00,778 --> 01:05:03,659
I'm just being honest.
I wanna lick your belly button.

1501
01:05:03,778 --> 01:05:06,868
And yours, your belly button's nice too.
You got a good one too.

1502
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:10,159
I haven't seen yours,
but I'm gonna lick the shit out of that thing.

1503
01:05:10,278 --> 01:05:11,659
Wow.

1504
01:05:11,778 --> 01:05:14,659
As the de facto lead wolf, right?

1505
01:05:14,778 --> 01:05:17,576
I, uh...
I should kick this mofo off,

1506
01:05:17,695 --> 01:05:20,868
but I got be honest with you.
I have no idea what to do, so...

1507
01:05:20,986 --> 01:05:21,739
Lead wolf?

1508
01:05:21,739 --> 01:05:22,493
Oh, yeah.

1509
01:05:22,611 --> 01:05:24,218
You had to be there kind of...

1510
01:05:24,218 --> 01:05:25,826
Tut-tut-tut. Okay.

1511
01:05:25,945 --> 01:05:28,451
Listen up, everybody.
As per usual,

1512
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:31,493
it is up to me to get this party started.

1513
01:05:31,611 --> 01:05:34,951
Hang on. I got something for you.
Hang on a second, ladies.

1514
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:41,323
Yeah, rock 'n' roll.

1515
01:05:41,323 --> 01:05:42,576
Holy moly.

1516
01:05:42,695 --> 01:05:43,784
We're on safari now.

1517
01:05:43,903 --> 01:05:45,034
Yeah.

1518
01:05:45,153 --> 01:05:46,659
How many leopards had to die?

1519
01:05:46,778 --> 01:05:48,951
Just one big old kinky leopard.

1520
01:05:50,278 --> 01:05:51,478
They won't kick us out.

1521
01:05:51,478 --> 01:05:53,701
If we're here,
they won't kick us out.

1522
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:54,620
Okay.

1523
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:56,243
They won't do it.

1524
01:05:56,361 --> 01:05:59,409
And we're totally sure we wanna do this?

1525
01:06:02,945 --> 01:06:06,201
Somebody do something.
Huh?

1526
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:09,076
All right?
Anybody?

1527
01:06:09,861 --> 01:06:14,243
All right, fuck it. I'm gonna call it.
Sue, kiss Alison. I'm gonna shirt touching myself.

1528
01:06:14,361 --> 01:06:18,076
Oh.
We could shirt with a back-rub circle like in college.

1529
01:06:20,778 --> 01:06:22,993
I'll get things started.

1530
01:06:23,111 --> 01:06:24,576
Yes.
Yeah!

1531
01:06:24,695 --> 01:06:26,784
Here we go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1532
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:30,618
I'm sorry, I can't.
I can't do this any more.

1533
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:32,409
I can't. I can't do this.
I'm sorry.

1534
01:06:34,861 --> 01:06:35,909
I knew it.

1535
01:06:36,028 --> 01:06:38,243
I knew you'd fucking puss out, man.

1536
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:40,659
I'm not pussing out.
I'm happen in a relationship

1537
01:06:40,778 --> 01:06:43,659
that I really appreciate.
And I don't wanna fuck this up.

1538
01:06:43,778 --> 01:06:46,576
Classic Duquez. You know,
it's like doughnuts, no doughnuts,

1539
01:06:46,695 --> 01:06:48,576
hat, no hat, orgy,
no orgy.

1540
01:06:48,695 --> 01:06:50,534
We take a look-see through the window

1541
01:06:50,653 --> 01:06:53,201
and if it looks, like,
too freaky or lame,

1542
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,909
Yeah.
We take off.

1543
01:06:55,028 --> 01:06:59,159
And if it looks,
you know, cool, we go in.

1544
01:06:59,278 --> 01:07:00,114
Okay?

1545
01:07:00,114 --> 01:07:00,951
okay...

1546
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:02,534
I'm not mad at you.

1547
01:07:02,653 --> 01:07:05,034
Eric, Eric.
I love what's going on here,

1548
01:07:05,153 --> 01:07:07,284
but I don't think you need to insult each other.

1549
01:07:07,403 --> 01:07:08,718
You should actually communicate.

1550
01:07:08,718 --> 01:07:10,034
My God, Alison, please for all of us?

1551
01:07:10,153 --> 01:07:11,927
Would you give it a rest? Just one night?

1552
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:13,701
You're totally uncomfortable with real emotion.

1553
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:16,368
Oh, yeah, I can't.
I'm the only one here with issues.

1554
01:07:16,486 --> 01:07:19,201
It's just me?
What about you and your disfunctional relationship?

1555
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:19,927
We broke up.

1556
01:07:19,927 --> 01:07:20,534
You broke up?

1557
01:07:20,653 --> 01:07:21,177
Yes.

1558
01:07:21,177 --> 01:07:21,701
Oh, you broke up?

1559
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:25,201
Like the same you guys broke up a couple years
ago at the Oktoberfest in July party?

1560
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,386
Like that kind of broke up?

1561
01:07:26,386 --> 01:07:27,451
Wait, what happened on Oktoberfest?

1562
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:30,868
This one tells me that her and Marcus are broken up.
The're over. Done. Fenito. Right?

1563
01:07:30,986 --> 01:07:34,034
So, we're joking around, we having some drinks,
she tells me about it, then we hook up.

1564
01:07:34,153 --> 01:07:36,743
Very next morning,
she's having brunch with the guy.

1565
01:07:36,861 --> 01:07:39,201
Whoa, whoa, wait? What?

1566
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:40,659
You never told me this.

1567
01:07:40,778 --> 01:07:44,576
Sue, I don't need to tell you because nothing happened.
We didn't sleep together.

1568
01:07:44,695 --> 01:07:47,076
You told me it was a blowjob,
she wouldn't swallow.

1569
01:07:47,195 --> 01:07:49,368
No, I did not, Mike.
I did not say that.

1570
01:07:49,486 --> 01:07:50,739
It was a fucking hand job.

1571
01:07:50,739 --> 01:07:51,993
Oh, that's hand job. That's right.

1572
01:07:52,111 --> 01:07:54,243
It was a hand job.
I'm sorry. My bad.

1573
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:55,468
Please don't go there.

1574
01:07:55,468 --> 01:07:56,576
No, no, no.

1575
01:07:56,695 --> 01:08:00,076
Alison, shut up.
You're a hypocrite.

1576
01:08:00,194 --> 01:08:01,492
What's going on?

1577
01:08:01,611 --> 01:08:05,992
First of all,
they're dressed like Indians from India.

1578
01:08:06,111 --> 01:08:07,093
That makes much more sense.

1579
01:08:07,093 --> 01:08:08,076
Yeah.

1580
01:08:08,194 --> 01:08:09,593
This is why I don't tell you.

1581
01:08:09,593 --> 01:08:10,992
You could've given him a blowjob.

1582
01:08:11,111 --> 01:08:12,302
Why didn't you fuck him?

1583
01:08:12,302 --> 01:08:13,492
Why don't you get over it?

1584
01:08:13,611 --> 01:08:16,451
How long are you gonna be obsessed with Eric?

1585
01:08:17,403 --> 01:08:18,492
Oh, shit.

1586
01:08:19,486 --> 01:08:21,034
Wait, what?

1587
01:08:22,444 --> 01:08:24,451
Okay. Ookay...

1588
01:08:24,569 --> 01:08:26,784
Urch' your brakes on, people.

1589
01:08:26,903 --> 01:08:29,492
We are rapidly losing the erotic vibe.

1590
01:08:30,069 --> 01:08:33,617
I'm gonna get this party rocking right here in a major way.

1591
01:08:33,736 --> 01:08:35,326
What you got, man?

1592
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:37,867
Ready, set,
here we go.

1593
01:08:37,986 --> 01:08:40,284
Oh!
Let loose the Kraken.

1594
01:08:40,403 --> 01:08:42,326
Yeah!

1595
01:08:42,444 --> 01:08:45,451
Will you give it a break, Mike?
This shit's pathetic.

1596
01:08:45,569 --> 01:08:48,201
Oh, fuck you.
You fucking pussy. You're lame.

1597
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:49,784
You're the lame one, man.

1598
01:08:49,903 --> 01:08:53,284
You don't have a job. You don't have a girlfriend.
You just follow Eric around

1599
01:08:53,403 --> 01:08:56,742
and do everything he tells you to do.
You're like his little fucking pet.

1600
01:08:59,444 --> 01:09:01,076
Dougie.

1601
01:09:01,194 --> 01:09:02,284
Fuck you, Doug.

1602
01:09:06,986 --> 01:09:10,951
Is that what all of you think of me?
You think that I'm his...? You think I'm his fucking pet?

1603
01:09:11,069 --> 01:09:12,784
No.

1604
01:09:13,486 --> 01:09:16,992
He meant pet in a nice way.

1605
01:09:19,694 --> 01:09:21,742
Is he fucking with me right now?

1606
01:09:22,342 --> 01:09:25,836
This is the worst orgy ever.

1607
01:09:25,236 --> 01:09:27,284
Should we just go home or...?

1608
01:09:27,403 --> 01:09:28,909
No.

1609
01:09:29,028 --> 01:09:31,284
We already got a sitter.

1610
01:09:31,403 --> 01:09:33,951
You wanna go see a movie or you wanna...?

1611
01:09:37,653 --> 01:09:39,284
Okay, okay.
All right, time out.

1612
01:09:39,403 --> 01:09:41,576
Time out.
Time out, T.O., okay?

1613
01:09:41,694 --> 01:09:44,951
Look, I think everyone just needs to take a deep breath.

1614
01:09:45,069 --> 01:09:46,367
All right?

1615
01:09:47,361 --> 01:09:50,826
We need to relax and chill out for a second,
all right?

1616
01:09:50,944 --> 01:09:52,492
Whoa!

1617
01:09:52,611 --> 01:09:53,951
Where are you going?

1618
01:09:54,069 --> 01:09:56,201
I'm just going outside to get some fresh air.

1619
01:09:56,319 --> 01:09:57,867
Clear my head.

1620
01:10:00,986 --> 01:10:03,534
I swear to God, guys,
I thought this was gonna be fun.

1621
01:10:27,111 --> 01:10:29,659
Oh, yeah.
Oh!

1622
01:10:29,778 --> 01:10:32,492
Why won't God just let me have an orgy?

1623
01:10:40,028 --> 01:10:43,326
Okay. All right,
here we go.

1624
01:10:46,403 --> 01:10:47,593
Eric.

1625
01:10:47,593 --> 01:10:48,784
Kelly, heh, heh.

1626
01:10:48,903 --> 01:10:51,492
What are you doing here?
I thought you were doing something with your friends.

1627
01:10:51,611 --> 01:10:52,826
I know.
I know. Uh...

1628
01:10:52,944 --> 01:10:54,534
Did you fly here on a carpet?

1629
01:10:54,653 --> 01:10:56,909
No, heh.
No, no. I, uh...

1630
01:10:57,028 --> 01:10:59,992
It's a last-second costume concept for, uh...

1631
01:11:00,069 --> 01:11:04,284
Look, I, uh... I've been thinking about
things and I realized something.

1632
01:11:05,028 --> 01:11:06,159
Oh, shit.

1633
01:11:06,278 --> 01:11:08,909
I thought we ordered pizza.
What'd you get, Indian food?

1634
01:11:11,528 --> 01:11:12,617
I'm sorry.

1635
01:11:12,736 --> 01:11:15,659
I, uh...
Sorry to interrupt. Sorry.

1636
01:11:15,778 --> 01:11:18,576
Uh, Pete, give us a second?
Hey, hey, hey, Eric.

1637
01:11:18,694 --> 01:11:20,284
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1638
01:11:20,403 --> 01:11:20,968
You didn't call.

1639
01:11:20,968 --> 01:11:21,534
I know.

1640
01:11:21,653 --> 01:11:24,367
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1641
01:11:24,486 --> 01:11:27,242
Oh, pizza?
Really?

1642
01:11:27,361 --> 01:11:28,343
I'm sorry.

1643
01:11:28,343 --> 01:11:29,325
No, that's all right.

1644
01:11:29,444 --> 01:11:30,364
Hey, what's up, man?

1645
01:11:30,364 --> 01:11:31,284
Eighteen bucks.

1646
01:11:31,402 --> 01:11:32,950
Go, have fun.
Hone...

1647
01:11:33,069 --> 01:11:35,284
Honestly.
No biggie.

1648
01:11:35,402 --> 01:11:36,784
I'll call you tomorrow.

1649
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:39,992
Bye.

1650
01:11:41,819 --> 01:11:45,784
Like I don't know that I don't have a girlfriend.

1651
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:51,325
Like I'm not trying to remember
that every fucking night of my life.

1652
01:11:51,444 --> 01:11:53,700
It's hard.

1653
01:12:00,661 --> 01:12:02,185
So where were we?

1654
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:04,209
Where'd you go?

1655
01:12:03,827 --> 01:12:05,959
I know, I know,
I know, I, uh... Heh.

1656
01:12:06,077 --> 01:12:08,875
I'm sorry I left. You know, I...

1657
01:12:09,375 --> 01:12:16,827
I'm gonna be honest
with you, guys. Um, I'm freaking out a little.

1658
01:12:16,327 --> 01:12:19,042
I have had the best times of my life

1659
01:12:19,161 --> 01:12:21,375
with you guys in this house

1660
01:12:21,494 --> 01:12:26,167
and I'm gonna miss it.

1661
01:12:26,494 --> 01:12:29,167
I'm gonna miss it so much.

1662
01:12:29,286 --> 01:12:31,709
I love you GUYS...

1663
01:12:32,009 --> 01:12:35,544
I love every single one of you.

1664
01:12:35,244 --> 01:12:36,667
She wasn't home, huh?

1665
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:40,167
No.
No, She was home.

1666
01:12:40,286 --> 01:12:41,500
She was on a date.

1667
01:12:43,202 --> 01:12:46,625
Yeah.
And I showed up dressed like fucking Aladdin.

1668
01:12:48,577 --> 01:12:51,000
Well, I think that you look adorable.

1669
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:55,500
And I am so happy that you're back.

1670
01:12:55,619 --> 01:12:59,250
It's been a pretty emotional night for all of us.

1671
01:12:59,369 --> 01:13:02,750
How about a big super-gay group hug?

1672
01:13:02,869 --> 01:13:03,914
Oh, yeah.

1673
01:13:03,914 --> 01:13:04,959
Group hug.

1674
01:13:05,077 --> 01:13:06,125
Yeah.

1675
01:13:06,244 --> 01:13:08,625
Oh!
I love you guys.

1676
01:13:13,452 --> 01:13:14,709
Oh, my God.

1677
01:13:14,827 --> 01:13:16,959


1678
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:19,659
Oh, my... I would not have called that.

1679
01:13:24,536 --> 01:13:26,167
Hey, what was that about earlier?

1680
01:13:26,286 --> 01:13:27,667
Yeah, nothing.
Later. What?

1681
01:13:30,202 --> 01:13:31,500
Wha...?

1682
01:13:32,577 --> 01:13:34,375
Oh, gosh!

1683
01:13:34,494 --> 01:13:36,792
It's happening.
It's really happening.

1684
01:13:36,911 --> 01:13:39,667
We can do this.
I don't know if I can.

1685
01:13:39,786 --> 01:13:41,542
We'll do it together.
Okay?

1686
01:13:43,869 --> 01:13:46,125
One.

1687
01:13:47,536 --> 01:13:49,542
Two.

1688
01:13:51,869 --> 01:13:52,959
Three.

1689
01:13:55,744 --> 01:13:57,750
Hello, boobs.

1690
01:14:00,411 --> 01:14:01,584
Are they okay?

1691
01:14:02,784 --> 01:14:05,184
They're fucking fabulous.

1692
01:14:05,036 --> 01:14:07,250
Thank you.

1693
01:14:09,577 --> 01:14:12,709
Oh.
And just so you know, um,

1694
01:14:12,827 --> 01:14:17,167
I've never been able to orgasm,
so no pressure.

1695
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,250
I'm all about giving pleasure.

1696
01:14:19,369 --> 01:14:21,500
This is so much better than porn.

1697
01:14:32,036 --> 01:14:33,542
Oh, my God!

1698
01:14:33,661 --> 01:14:34,709
I told you so.

1699
01:14:34,827 --> 01:14:35,959
You weren't kidding.

1700
01:14:36,577 --> 01:14:39,542
That is remarkable that he is insecure.

1701
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:44,459
Tequila!

1702
01:15:08,910 --> 01:15:11,542
Everybody, drink from the ceiling.

1703
01:15:21,535 --> 01:15:22,601
Hey, Mike.

1704
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:23,667
Hi there.

1705
01:15:23,785 --> 01:15:27,875
You guys have got try these chocolate-covered
strawberries. They're so decadent.

1706
01:15:27,994 --> 01:15:30,333
Oh, no, no. I'm good.
I just had some Bagel Bites.

1707
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:32,842
Where'd you get Bagel Bites?

1708
01:15:32,142 --> 01:15:33,833
Shh. Forget it.

1709
01:15:33,952 --> 01:15:35,583
Mahalo, freaky people.

1710
01:15:35,702 --> 01:15:39,500
We were thinking it might be fun if we
all went out and made love in the pool.

1711
01:15:39,619 --> 01:15:40,809
Yes, yes.

1712
01:15:41,309 --> 01:15:42,500
Yeah, you wanna go in the pool?

1713
01:15:42,119 --> 01:15:44,542
No. No, no. We're good right here.
We're good.

1714
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:45,414
Oh, we're okay.

1715
01:15:45,414 --> 01:15:46,167
Yeah.

1716
01:15:46,285 --> 01:15:49,500
Thanks though.
It's chlorinated. Have fun.

1717
01:15:51,869 --> 01:15:53,958
Sue, I'm so happy for you.

1718
01:15:54,077 --> 01:15:57,208
All right, Hey, guys,
could we just get a minute? Just a minute?

1719
01:15:57,327 --> 01:15:59,208
Yeah, just give us a sec,
will you?

1720
01:15:59,327 --> 01:16:02,292
Oh, so sorry.

1721
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:05,010
We're not giving you enough privacy at an orgy?

1722
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:08,710
Kind of a fair hit.

1723
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:09,583
Yeah, now, shh.

1724
01:16:09,702 --> 01:16:11,625
Are you okay?
You wanna talk or something?

1725
01:16:11,744 --> 01:16:14,625
No, no.
Just be in the moment.

1726
01:16:14,744 --> 01:16:17,833
Okay. Yeah, no, can do.
Can do. Okay. Okay.

1727
01:16:20,369 --> 01:16:21,434
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1728
01:16:21,434 --> 01:16:22,500
Oh, yeah?

1729
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:24,125
You like to dirty talk?
Yeah?

1730
01:16:24,244 --> 01:16:25,122
Ooh, fuck.

1731
01:16:25,122 --> 01:16:26,000
Okay, you wanna fuck me?

1732
01:16:26,119 --> 01:16:27,559
You wanna fuck me hard?

1733
01:16:27,559 --> 01:16:29,000
No, Sue. Hop off. My foot, my foot.

1734
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:30,208
Oh, oh, okay.

1735
01:16:30,327 --> 01:16:31,458
Oh, foot cramp.
Oh!

1736
01:16:31,577 --> 01:16:32,917
Okay.
Ooh, that's a doozie.

1737
01:16:33,035 --> 01:16:34,250
Shh. Okay.
All right

1738
01:16:34,369 --> 01:16:37,208
Oh, God,
my big toe's so far away from my other toes.

1739
01:16:37,327 --> 01:16:39,250
Okay, hey.
Hey, flex it out.

1740
01:16:39,369 --> 01:16:41,083
Flex it out.
Flex it, okay.

1741
01:16:41,202 --> 01:16:43,500
Oh, we should have done this 15 years ago.

1742
01:16:43,952 --> 01:16:45,917
Hey, guys.

1743
01:16:45,917 --> 01:16:48,217
I broke my diet.

1744
01:16:51,535 --> 01:16:52,476
Okay. You're good?

1745
01:16:52,476 --> 01:16:53,417
Oh, yeah.

1746
01:16:53,035 --> 01:16:54,958
Yeah? You're good?
Okay. There it goes.

1747
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:57,458
There it goes.
Oh, wow. Okay.

1748
01:16:57,577 --> 01:16:59,375
Shh! Okay.
Okay. Okay.

1749
01:16:59,494 --> 01:17:02,833
Oh, no, it's back.
It's back worse!

1750
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:05,083
Ooh, it's...
The little guy is in on it now.

1751
01:17:05,202 --> 01:17:07,875
Hey, gang.
Sake bombs.

1752
01:17:17,244 --> 01:17:18,542
Oh, my God!

1753
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:21,375
Oh, my God, my dick is having the best night of its life.

1754
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:24,535
Oh, we're all fucking. Oh, we're all finally fucking.

1755
01:17:24,535 --> 01:17:26,625
Oh, and I can be as loud as I fucking want!

1756
01:17:26,744 --> 01:17:27,833
Oh, no.
Shh, shh.

1757
01:17:30,327 --> 01:17:31,792
Owl Ow,
my contact.

1758
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:33,375
Alison, my contact.

1759
01:17:33,494 --> 01:17:35,038
I'm good. I'm good. Play through.

1760
01:17:35,038 --> 01:17:36,583
Bro, count me down.

1761
01:17:36,702 --> 01:17:37,955
What?

1762
01:17:37,955 --> 01:17:39,208
Count me down from five.

1763
01:17:39,208 --> 01:17:40,869
What does that even mean?

1764
01:17:40,869 --> 01:17:42,531
Oh, fuck! Count me down from 10.

1765
01:17:42,531 --> 01:17:44,796
Count him down, Adam.
Trust me, just count him down.

1766
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:48,712
Guys, this whole sex in the pool thing is not working.

1767
01:17:49,323 --> 01:17:51,879
Water is not a lubricant.

1768
01:17:51,490 --> 01:17:54,837
Okay, brothers and sisters.
Let's take this party indoors.

1769
01:17:54,948 --> 01:17:57,629
I'm running with a boner!

1770
01:17:57,948 --> 01:17:59,504
Pineapple mojitos.

1771
01:18:00,823 --> 01:18:02,337
Yeah, mulched with fresh mint.

1772
01:18:04,073 --> 01:18:05,171
Fuck!

1773
01:18:05,281 --> 01:18:06,462
Are you ready?

1774
01:18:06,573 --> 01:18:08,712
As I'll ever be.

1775
01:18:13,115 --> 01:18:15,504
Ooh! I'm next,
I'm next, I'm next.

1776
01:18:16,698 --> 01:18:17,796
Vodka tonic.

1777
01:18:23,323 --> 01:18:26,295
Yo, can I tag in?

1778
01:18:26,406 --> 01:18:29,879
Oh! You're like the sweet,
tender lion.

1779
01:18:29,989 --> 01:18:31,670
Mike, go away.

1780
01:18:31,781 --> 01:18:35,295
You guys haven't slept with anybody else yet.
You're hogging Willow.

1781
01:18:35,406 --> 01:18:37,129
Go away.

1782
01:18:37,239 --> 01:18:39,004
Go away, Mike.

1783
01:18:39,714 --> 01:18:40,812
Vodka.

1784
01:18:42,131 --> 01:18:43,229
Come on.

1785
01:18:43,339 --> 01:18:47,437
Sue, I just wanna say I'm so
sorry about the whole Eric thing.

1786
01:18:47,548 --> 01:18:50,895
No. Totally don't.
It's so over. I don't care.

1787
01:18:51,006 --> 01:18:55,729
No, but you know,
you're a really good friend and I love you.

1788
01:18:55,839 --> 01:19:00,187
No, I love you.
You are so smart and you're so beautiful.

1789
01:19:00,298 --> 01:19:04,062
And I totally get why he would wanna be with you.

1790
01:19:04,173 --> 01:19:05,604
You're the beautiful one.

1791
01:19:05,714 --> 01:19:08,604
Oh, my God,
your body is ridiculous.

1792
01:19:08,714 --> 01:19:10,895
Your body is ridiculous, okay?

1793
01:19:11,006 --> 01:19:14,187
And I would give anything to have your breasts

1794
01:19:14,298 --> 01:19:15,979
just for, like,
one day.

1795
01:19:16,089 --> 01:19:20,562
Yeah, but your ass is off the charts, seriously.

1796
01:19:20,714 --> 01:19:23,104
Okay. I would kill to have your eyes.

1797
01:19:23,104 --> 01:19:27,131
You know that you have the most beautiful green eyes

1798
01:19:27,131 --> 01:19:30,312
that I have ever seen.

1799
01:19:35,798 --> 01:19:37,270
Oh, yeah.

1800
01:19:42,381 --> 01:19:43,159
Oh, yeah

1801
01:19:43,159 --> 01:19:43,937
Oh!

1802
01:19:44,548 --> 01:19:45,854
Wow!

1803
01:19:45,964 --> 01:19:47,187
I saw that.
You see that?

1804
01:19:47,298 --> 01:19:49,180
It looked like a little flash of light.

1805
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:51,062
I know. I think I just... God.

1806
01:19:51,714 --> 01:19:53,687
I never thought I'd hear myself say this,

1807
01:19:53,798 --> 01:19:56,062
but I'm gonna take a break

1808
01:19:56,173 --> 01:19:59,104
from this girl-on-girl-on-girl action

1809
01:19:59,214 --> 01:20:02,729
and check the score of the Yankee game.

1810
01:20:02,839 --> 01:20:04,895
This feels fucking fabulous.

1811
01:20:09,089 --> 01:20:10,145
Ah, Michael!

1812
01:20:10,756 --> 01:20:11,638
Let's go.

1813
01:20:11,638 --> 01:20:12,520
Are you sure?

1814
01:20:12,631 --> 01:20:14,645
Yes, 100,000 percent sure.

1815
01:20:14,756 --> 01:20:15,993
Let's go. Right now.

1816
01:20:15,993 --> 01:20:17,229
Okay, okay. Let's go.

1817
01:20:17,339 --> 01:20:20,979
You fucking did it. Look at this.
You are awe-inspiring.

1818
01:20:21,089 --> 01:20:22,229
Oh.

1819
01:20:22,339 --> 01:20:23,239
Thank you, Mike.

1820
01:20:23,239 --> 01:20:23,562
No.

1821
01:20:23,673 --> 01:20:27,979
I'm gonna tell you something right now and I
want you to listen because I fucking mean it.

1822
01:20:28,089 --> 01:20:29,687
Okay...

1823
01:20:29,798 --> 01:20:32,770
You could be the president of the United States.

1824
01:20:34,631 --> 01:20:36,520
Well I don't know, not after something like this.

1825
01:20:36,631 --> 01:20:39,937
Hey, shh, no.
I'm fucking serious.

1826
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:43,145
You could do it if you wanted to.

1827
01:20:43,256 --> 01:20:45,145
Yeah.

1828
01:20:45,256 --> 01:20:47,187
You're getting kind of close, Mike.

1829
01:20:47,298 --> 01:20:48,034
Am I?

1830
01:20:48,034 --> 01:20:48,770
Yeah.

1831
01:20:48,881 --> 01:20:50,187
Oh.

1832
01:20:50,298 --> 01:20:52,645
You're not trying to kiss me,
are you?

1833
01:20:52,756 --> 01:20:54,437
Would it scare you if I was?

1834
01:20:55,298 --> 01:20:57,145
I guess so.

1835
01:20:57,256 --> 01:20:59,645
Fucking kiss chicken, dude.

1836
01:20:59,756 --> 01:21:00,930
It's on.

1837
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:02,104
All right.

1838
01:21:02,214 --> 01:21:03,937
Let me just set this right here.

1839
01:21:04,048 --> 01:21:05,687
Whatever.

1840
01:21:12,589 --> 01:21:13,989
You scared yet?

1841
01:21:16,312 --> 01:21:17,112
No.

1842
01:21:17,131 --> 01:21:18,284
No?

1843
01:21:18,284 --> 01:21:19,437
Mm-mm.

1844
01:21:19,548 --> 01:21:23,104
How about now?
Touching your nose with my nose.

1845
01:21:23,214 --> 01:21:25,437
It's okay,
I'm part Eskimo.

1846
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:27,562
We're nose-kissing, buddy.

1847
01:21:27,673 --> 01:21:30,104
It's more than our noses touching right now.

1848
01:21:30,214 --> 01:21:32,604
It's our souls.

1849
01:21:37,548 --> 01:21:39,437
Yeah, that's been brewing for years.

1850
01:21:39,548 --> 01:21:40,895
Well, I think we both won.

1851
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:44,770
I'm pretty sure we both just lost.

1852
01:21:48,923 --> 01:21:49,868
Tonic.

1853
01:21:49,868 --> 01:21:50,812
Boo!

1854
01:21:53,714 --> 01:21:56,812
Don't stop. Don't stop. Don't stop.
Almost there. Almost there.

1855
01:21:56,922 --> 01:21:59,228
No, don't stop. Don't stop.
Ah! Don't stop.

1856
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:02,645
It feels so good.
It feels so good, don't stop.

1857
01:22:06,631 --> 01:22:07,687
How about that?

1858
01:22:07,797 --> 01:22:10,270
So how long has this been going on?

1859
01:22:10,381 --> 01:22:11,687
About a half an hour.

1860
01:22:11,797 --> 01:22:13,853
I'm good. I'm gonna...
I'm getting it. Ah!

1861
01:22:13,964 --> 01:22:15,103
Poor bastard.

1862
01:22:15,214 --> 01:22:17,228
Fucking so good.
Aah!

1863
01:22:17,839 --> 01:22:19,187
Hang in there, buddy.

1864
01:22:18,687 --> 01:22:20,131
Almost there.

1865
01:22:20,131 --> 01:22:23,478
Yeah.
Yes. Yes!

1866
01:22:23,589 --> 01:22:25,437
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'm coming.

1867
01:22:25,547 --> 01:22:28,103
Yes!
Oh, yes!

1868
01:22:28,214 --> 01:22:29,853
Yes, yes, yes!

1869
01:22:29,964 --> 01:22:32,853
Oh, yes!
Yes!

1870
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,816
Yes!
Aah!

1871
01:22:55,293 --> 01:22:58,149
Hey!
Good morning, everybody.

1872
01:22:58,252 --> 01:23:00,357
So, uh,
look what I got.

1873
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:02,982
Commemorative Labor Day orgy T-shirts right here.

1874
01:23:03,085 --> 01:23:04,482
Pink and blue.

1875
01:23:04,585 --> 01:23:06,774
Unisex, 100 percent cotton.

1876
01:23:06,877 --> 01:23:07,982
You made T-shirts?

1877
01:23:08,085 --> 01:23:09,566
Yup.
Laura.

1878
01:23:09,835 --> 01:23:11,566
Huh?

1879
01:23:12,293 --> 01:23:13,732
Where are we gonna wear these?

1880
01:23:13,835 --> 01:23:16,357
Anywhere.
What do you mean?

1881
01:23:16,877 --> 01:23:20,316
Jesus Christ,
I am hungover like a madman.

1882
01:23:21,585 --> 01:23:23,857
All right, ladies.
Ladies, I got one...

1883
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,566
One easy question for all of you.

1884
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:29,316
Overall, where would you rank me?

1885
01:23:29,418 --> 01:23:30,857
Just have a bagel and relax.

1886
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,482
Listen, I need to know.
I just... I need to know.

1887
01:23:33,585 --> 01:23:37,441
Well, for me,
there was one clear winner.

1888
01:23:37,543 --> 01:23:41,191
Okay, I know, good. Eric. Blah, blah.
Big surprise. What about this guy?

1889
01:23:41,293 --> 01:23:43,293
I was gonna say Adam.

1890
01:23:43,293 --> 01:23:44,441
Adam.

1891
01:23:44,543 --> 01:23:45,857
What?

1892
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,524
For a neurotic hypochondriac with panic attacks,

1893
01:23:48,627 --> 01:23:51,149
he was really uninhibited.

1894
01:23:51,252 --> 01:23:53,607
So what? Out of the four dudes in the house,

1895
01:23:53,607 --> 01:23:57,127
I didn't even rank in the top two?
That's what you're telling me?

1896
01:23:57,127 --> 01:23:58,316
Didn't I do my move?

1897
01:23:58,418 --> 01:24:01,191
The move with the fingers and the tongue?
The Thoosh?

1898
01:24:02,326 --> 01:24:03,149
Laura.

1899
01:24:03,252 --> 01:24:04,763
Come on, I thooshed you. I know I did.

1900
01:24:04,763 --> 01:24:06,274
You don't need to do it now.

1901
01:24:06,377 --> 01:24:08,107
You did it last night.
We don't need to see it again.

1902
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:09,982
Yeah.
Can we just eat breakfast?

1903
01:24:12,668 --> 01:24:13,732
It's Marcus.

1904
01:24:17,127 --> 01:24:18,566
Hello?

1905
01:24:19,502 --> 01:24:21,399
Oh, tell him how much we missed him last night.

1906
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:24,732
Hey.
Everybody's up.

1907
01:24:24,835 --> 01:24:25,941
Hey.

1908
01:24:26,043 --> 01:24:27,316
Morning.

1909
01:24:27,418 --> 01:24:29,899
Hey, man,
about the shit that went down last night...

1910
01:24:30,002 --> 01:24:34,441
Dude. Oh, shit, I'm sorry if I did anything
weird to you or Willow, like, any thooshing.

1911
01:24:34,543 --> 01:24:38,732
Anything like that. I'm sorry.
I was so fucking hammered, I don't remember anything.

1912
01:24:38,835 --> 01:24:39,941
Seriously, nothing?

1913
01:24:40,043 --> 01:24:41,293
You don't remember anything?

1914
01:24:41,293 --> 01:24:42,107
No.

1915
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:45,816
Nothing.
I remember the fucking absinthe shots and then that's it.

1916
01:24:45,918 --> 01:24:50,399
I'm so bummed, that was gonna be spank
fodder for the next 20 years of my life.

1917
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:51,701
Total fucking blackout.

1918
01:24:51,701 --> 01:24:52,899
Thank God

1919
01:24:53,002 --> 01:24:54,274
Amen.

1920
01:24:54,377 --> 01:24:55,524
I got something for you.

1921
01:24:55,627 --> 01:24:56,701
Holy shit!

1922
01:24:56,701 --> 01:24:57,774
Dougie.

1923
01:24:57,877 --> 01:24:59,607
I did it.
I got more coming for everybody else.

1924
01:24:59,710 --> 01:25:01,566
Oh, my God, dude,
this is major.

1925
01:25:01,668 --> 01:25:06,399
I wanted hat,
but he was so passionate about no hat.

1926
01:25:06,502 --> 01:25:07,534
No fucking hat.

1927
01:25:07,534 --> 01:25:08,566
Good shit, man.

1928
01:25:08,668 --> 01:25:10,857
Altough, I still would've Photoshopped in the dudes

1929
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,191
schnizzing on your face.
But it's just me.

1930
01:25:13,293 --> 01:25:14,774
You made fucking shirts.
Fuck.

1931
01:25:14,877 --> 01:25:17,357
Yeah. Hey, Willow,
grab one of those.

1932
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:19,357
It's blue and pink,
my favorite.

1933
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:20,950
A medium. Awesome.

1934
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:22,440
Well, well, well,
It's the Breakfast Club.

1935
01:25:22,543 --> 01:25:25,315
Oh, there he is.
Sam Rockwell.

1936
01:25:25,418 --> 01:25:27,690
Ha, yeah,
there you go.

1937
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:31,774
Thank you, I'm sorry, and you're welcome.

1938
01:25:34,543 --> 01:25:35,774
Still a little sore.

1939
01:25:39,210 --> 01:25:40,315
Hi.

1940
01:25:41,626 --> 01:25:44,232
Yeah, I think we're headed down shortly.

1941
01:25:45,085 --> 01:25:46,940
Yeah, I'll see you there.

1942
01:25:48,001 --> 01:25:49,242
That was Kelly.

1943
01:25:49,242 --> 01:25:50,482
Slut.

1944
01:25:51,482 --> 01:25:53,804
Uh, she's, uh,

1945
01:25:53,804 --> 01:25:56,126
headed to the beach. I'm gonna meet her.

1946
01:25:55,126 --> 01:25:58,190
That's gonna be some awkward shit.
I wanna be front-row center.

1947
01:25:58,293 --> 01:25:59,982
Let's do it.
I'm there.

1948
01:26:01,376 --> 01:26:03,482
Give the ticks a goodbye hug for me, please?

1949
01:26:03,585 --> 01:26:04,617
I will do so.

1950
01:26:04,617 --> 01:26:05,649
Okay.

1951
01:26:11,085 --> 01:26:14,565
I can stay here and hang out with you if...

1952
01:26:14,668 --> 01:26:16,482
Yeah, yes.

1953
01:26:16,626 --> 01:26:17,774
Okay, heh.

1954
01:26:17,876 --> 01:26:21,315
We could, uh,
take a dip in the pool or something.

1955
01:26:21,418 --> 01:26:23,482
Oh, the... Yeah.
I don't know about the pool

1956
01:26:23,585 --> 01:26:25,774
after what happened in there last night.

1957
01:26:27,418 --> 01:26:30,274
But you wanna do the crossword with me?

1958
01:26:31,043 --> 01:26:32,440
I'd love that.

1959
01:26:34,585 --> 01:26:36,399
Uh, 16 Across.

1960
01:26:38,185 --> 01:26:41,249
So, what happened with, uh, you-know-who?

1961
01:26:41,351 --> 01:26:43,051
Marcus apologized for everything.

1962
01:26:43,051 --> 01:26:44,551
He wants to go to couples therapy.

1963
01:26:44,551 --> 01:26:45,832
You're getting back together?

1964
01:26:45,935 --> 01:26:49,124
We're gonna go to city hall,
get married, see if we can make it work.

1965
01:26:49,226 --> 01:26:50,217
What the fuck?

1966
01:26:50,217 --> 01:26:51,207
Just kidding.

1967
01:26:52,643 --> 01:26:56,665
Okay. Yeah, no,
it's totally over.

1968
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:58,749
Nice.
I'm proud of you.

1969
01:26:58,851 --> 01:27:00,165
Thanks, Sue.

1970
01:27:00,268 --> 01:27:02,665
That's too bad.
I always liked that guy.

1971
01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:05,457
God, I hope Kate has some guys for us.

1972
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:07,665
Hell, I'd even go to Hoboken.

1973
01:27:07,768 --> 01:27:10,957
I mean, if he's really amazing,
I'd consider going to Jersey City.

1974
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,165
Oh, you would not.

1975
01:27:12,268 --> 01:27:14,332
I'm just making a point.

1976
01:27:14,435 --> 01:27:17,165
Uh, so Eric, um,
last night,

1977
01:27:17,268 --> 01:27:18,874
Some things came up.

1978
01:27:18,976 --> 01:27:21,499
Yeah, I swear.
I had no idea.

1979
01:27:21,001 --> 01:27:23,274
No, it's fine, really.
It was just something

1980
01:27:23,376 --> 01:27:25,399
that I needed to get out of my system.

1981
01:27:32,710 --> 01:27:34,565
I hope she likes my sloppy seconds.

1982
01:27:34,668 --> 01:27:36,607
Oh, come on.

1983
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:39,096
Morning, Kelly.

1984
01:27:39,096 --> 01:27:40,607
Hey. Morning, Eric.

1985
01:27:40,710 --> 01:27:42,524
Hey.

1986
01:27:42,626 --> 01:27:44,565
Hi Kelly, I'm Mike.
We haven't officially met.

1987
01:27:44,668 --> 01:27:45,762
Nice to meet you.

1988
01:27:45,762 --> 01:27:46,857
Oh, wait, Mike.

1989
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:50,065
Right.
You're the guy that Dody was asking about.

1990
01:27:50,168 --> 01:27:53,690
She wanted your number for some
kind of business thing or something?

1991
01:27:55,710 --> 01:27:58,190
Ah, what the fuck.
Give her my digits, all right?

1992
01:27:58,293 --> 01:28:00,399
Nice to meet you.

1993
01:28:00,501 --> 01:28:04,190
Let loose the Kraken.
Yeah.

1994
01:28:04,293 --> 01:28:07,107
So wow. Okay.

1995
01:28:07,107 --> 01:28:08,107
About last night.

1996
01:28:08,107 --> 01:28:08,992
How about this?

1997
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:09,692
What?

1998
01:28:09,692 --> 01:28:11,492
How about this about last night?

1999
01:28:12,192 --> 01:28:15,326
We never talk about it ever, ever again.

2000
01:28:15,326 --> 01:28:16,974
It never happened.
All right?

2001
01:28:17,535 --> 01:28:19,349
You and I have just met.

2002
01:28:19,451 --> 01:28:21,932
We're starting fresh right here,
right now.

2003
01:28:23,451 --> 01:28:25,015
Done.

2004
01:28:26,451 --> 01:28:27,451
Hi, I'm Kelly.

2005
01:28:27,451 --> 01:28:28,551
Hi, Kelly. I'm Eric.

2006
01:28:28,551 --> 01:28:29,151
It's nice to meet you.

2007
01:28:29,151 --> 01:28:30,015
Nice to meet you.

2008
01:28:41,451 --> 01:28:42,682
Hey!

2009
01:28:48,849 --> 01:28:51,049
Your blackberry!

2010
01:28:50,826 --> 01:28:53,598
Ah!
Just an empty symbolic gesture.

2011
01:28:53,701 --> 01:28:55,265
I'm getting a new one on Tuesday.

2012
01:28:55,565 --> 01:28:58,346
But that did
feel really, really good.

2013
01:28:58,546 --> 01:29:01,326
So this is the beach, huh?

2014
01:29:00,826 --> 01:29:02,390
Pretty beautiful.
Who knew?

2015
01:29:02,493 --> 01:29:03,483
This is it.

2016
01:29:03,483 --> 01:29:04,473
Let's go on.

2017
01:29:10,201 --> 01:29:12,015
Okay, listen. I've got some bad news.

2018
01:29:12,015 --> 01:29:13,065
You're al Qaeda.

2019
01:29:13,065 --> 01:29:13,826
No.

2020
01:29:13,826 --> 01:29:16,223
You know the delay I pulled with closing the house?

2021
01:29:16,326 --> 01:29:18,307
It spooked the buyers and they pulled out.

2022
01:29:19,868 --> 01:29:20,668
The house isn't sold, yet?

2023
01:29:20,668 --> 01:29:21,182
No.

2024
01:29:23,493 --> 01:29:24,483
Are you mad?

2025
01:29:24,483 --> 01:29:25,473
No. No, no, no.

2026
01:29:25,576 --> 01:29:27,140
Will you hold on a sec though?

2027
01:29:27,243 --> 01:29:27,837
Hey, guys!

2028
01:29:27,837 --> 01:29:28,432
Yeah?

2029
01:29:28,534 --> 01:29:31,182
Quick announcement.
I have a really shitty Realtor.

2030
01:29:31,284 --> 01:29:32,296
Fire her!

2031
01:29:32,296 --> 01:29:33,307
And she blew the deal.

2032
01:29:33,409 --> 01:29:35,307
And the house still isn't sold.

2033
01:29:39,743 --> 01:29:40,400
They're pissed.

2034
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,057
They're really mad.

2035
01:29:41,159 --> 01:29:42,274
Great, now they're pissed.

2036
01:29:42,274 --> 01:29:43,390
They're mad.

2037
01:29:43,493 --> 01:29:47,140
Now I got shirt thinking of
something to do for Memorial Day.

2038
01:29:47,243 --> 01:29:49,765
We've been kicking around this idea for a brown party.

2039
01:29:49,868 --> 01:29:51,932
You know brown clothes,
brown food.

2040
01:29:53,868 --> 01:29:56,015
Hey, you guys remember Kelly, right?

2041
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:36,800
What do you want?

2042
01:30:36,916 --> 01:30:38,633
Password's roundelay.

2043
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:39,883
Who's your connection?

2044
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,633
Dody Henderson. She's our Realtor.

2045
01:30:41,633 --> 01:30:43,833
Oh, Dody. Yeah, she's in the swing.

2046
01:30:43,833 --> 01:30:46,425
Come on in.
Come on, you too.

2047
01:30:50,050 --> 01:30:51,350
Yeah. Okay.

2048
01:31:36,041 --> 01:31:38,008
<i>You say he's just a friend</i>

2049
01:31:38,125 --> 01:31:41,133
<i>Oh, baby, you</i>

2050
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:44,050
<i>You got what I need</i>

2051
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:45,258
What?!

2052
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:47,216
<i>But you say He's just a friend</i>

2053
01:31:47,333 --> 01:31:50,050
<i>What, what But you say he's just a friend</i>

2054
01:31:50,166 --> 01:31:52,633
<i>Oh, baby you</i>
