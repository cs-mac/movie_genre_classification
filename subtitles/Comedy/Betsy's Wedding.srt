00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,677
Eddie, you're dreaming.

4
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,687
- Eddie?
- What?

5
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,689
You're dreaming.

6
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,282
- Oh. Good morning.
- Good morning.

7
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:59,493
I'm sorry.

[Purring]

9
00:01:27,763 --> 00:01:29,697
If this goes in,

10
00:01:29,765 --> 00:01:32,529
this is gonna be a great day.

11
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,900
If this goes in
two out of three times,

12
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,412
this is gonna be a great day.

13
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,574
<i>[Shuffling Feet]</i>

14
00:01:56,792 --> 00:01:59,852
Whoa!
This is gonna be a great day.

15
00:01:59,928 --> 00:02:02,226
A <i>great</i> day!

16
00:02:02,297 --> 00:02:04,765
A... great day!

17
00:02:16,545 --> 00:02:19,844
So, what do you think?

18
00:02:19,915 --> 00:02:22,748
We'll finish
the first floor today, huh?

19
00:02:22,818 --> 00:02:26,879
I don't think so.
He's closing the project.

20
00:02:28,423 --> 00:02:32,052
- What's going on?
- I can't keep the project going.

21
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:34,857
- I know you were counting on this.
- What do you mean?

22
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,865
I lost my backing.
I gotta shut down.

23
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:39,867
- The whole development?
- Yeah.

24
00:02:39,935 --> 00:02:41,903
<i>[Eddie] I can bring this in for less.</i>

25
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,734
- Eddie, I'm busted.
- I can make adjustments.

26
00:02:44,806 --> 00:02:48,970
I owe you money. I'll get it to you.
Let's at least...

27
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,241
I'll call you tomorrow.
This is a great house.

28
00:02:52,314 --> 00:02:56,444
You know what you can make
on a house like this?

29
00:02:56,518 --> 00:02:59,385
This looks like a problem,
but we're fine.

30
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:01,115
<i>No problem.</i>

31
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:04,056
Delahaas says
this project is over, right?

32
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:06,287
All this work down the drain, right?

33
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:08,295
You kidding?

34
00:03:08,363 --> 00:03:11,992
Look. This was gonna
be an incredible house:

35
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,126
<i>A big, beautiful home on the water.</i>

36
00:03:14,202 --> 00:03:16,864
<i>If this was my place,</i>
<i>I'd go into hock to finish it.</i>

37
00:03:16,938 --> 00:03:19,168
That's what I'm gonna do!

38
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,335
I'm gonna get a loan.
I'm gonna take this over.

39
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:25,903
This isn't a problem.
It's an incredible opportunity!

40
00:03:25,981 --> 00:03:29,781
Turn around and look at what
I'm talking about. Look.

41
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,518
Take the day off.
I gotta organize a few things.

42
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,080
<i>This is a great day!</i>

43
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,564
- Hi.
- Hi.

44
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,698
Hello, Dad.
Happy birthday.

45
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,504
Thank you.
Lola, you look beautiful.

46
00:03:55,577 --> 00:03:58,102
You guys gonna stay
the whole weekend?

47
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,946
We all brought work.
Jake brought his entire office.

48
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:05,009
<i>We're having the phone</i>
<i>glued to his face.</i>

49
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:07,316
From New York to West Hampton,
I made one call.

50
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:09,880
It <i>lasted</i> from New York
to West Hampton.

51
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,483
I'm so glad you brought your gun.

52
00:04:12,561 --> 00:04:15,530
You never know who's gonna break in.

53
00:04:15,597 --> 00:04:17,929
<i>[Man] Why do we have</i>
<i>to drive to the country?</i>

54
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:18,897
<i>Oscar!</i>

55
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,901
I have a business to run, you know.

56
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,097
- It's my father's birthday.
- We could've seen him in the city.

57
00:04:24,172 --> 00:04:26,436
This is a family of lunatics.

58
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:28,976
I like your outfit.
It's really weird.

59
00:04:29,044 --> 00:04:31,706
I got an "A" for this
in design class,

60
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,340
but to me the whole thing seems...

61
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:37,317
- kinda conservative.
- No. Believe me, it's really weird.

62
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:39,649
- Yeah? Thanks.
- Yeah.

63
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:42,656
Tense up, everybody.
Uncle Oscar.

64
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:49,593
Look at this.
Mud. Mud!

65
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,633
$1,100 shoes, and
they leave mud around.

66
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:56,137
I know the girls aren't here,
but I can't wait.

67
00:04:56,204 --> 00:04:58,729
I'm gonna make a toast.
Here's to you, Morris.

68
00:04:58,807 --> 00:05:02,140
- <i>Know why I like your birthday?</i>
- Gives you a chance to talk.

69
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,078
He's always
giving me shots, this guy.

70
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:08,206
Let's go around the table.

71
00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:10,444
Why is Grandpa's birthday so special?

72
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,420
- <i>Betsy first.</i>
- Well...

73
00:05:13,488 --> 00:05:17,117
It brings our family together,
and families are what count.

74
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,559
Listen to him.
I had to drag him here.

75
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:22,722
He said he had work.

76
00:05:22,797 --> 00:05:26,494
Probably had to work the skirt off
some bleached blonde.

77
00:05:26,568 --> 00:05:28,661
Has he ever done that?

78
00:05:29,604 --> 00:05:31,799
Four of them, that I know of.

79
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:36,207
- You never told me.
- He's not worth complaining about.

80
00:05:36,278 --> 00:05:38,337
I'm getting even.

81
00:05:38,413 --> 00:05:41,246
Every time he tells me
about a parcel of real estate,

82
00:05:41,316 --> 00:05:45,912
I buy it under another name,
and then I sell it to him.

83
00:05:45,987 --> 00:05:48,922
He thinks he's dealing
with a stranger. It's me.

84
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,117
I never knew you
were having problems.

85
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:55,686
I just remember that someday
I'll have a nice nest egg.

86
00:05:55,764 --> 00:05:58,824
I can take a walk,
and he can go fuck himself.

87
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,400
Then I feel much better!

88
00:06:03,361 --> 00:06:05,022
Come on,

89
00:06:05,096 --> 00:06:07,291
you're not telling me anything.

90
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:09,390
<i>[Oscar] Tell me your news.</i>

91
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:10,764
Betsy?

92
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:13,963
Well, I sort of have some news.

93
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:16,370
Jake and I are getting married.

94
00:06:17,408 --> 00:06:19,535
Oh, my God.

95
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,872
My God!

96
00:06:22,947 --> 00:06:26,747
See? You don't find
things out unless you ask.

97
00:06:26,817 --> 00:06:29,445
I am so happy for you.

98
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,978
- I knew you were going to say that.
- Really?

99
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:38,561
My little sister married.

100
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:41,393
Mazel tov! I knew it.

101
00:06:41,465 --> 00:06:44,229
You're getting married, and
I can't find a guy to play cards.

102
00:06:44,302 --> 00:06:45,792
I hate you!

103
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,100
I'm gonna make the first gift.

104
00:06:48,172 --> 00:06:50,732
<i>It's a hard world.</i>
<i>Values have changed.</i>

105
00:06:50,808 --> 00:06:54,904
What's the hardest thing
for a young couple to find today?

106
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:56,970
A good rental.

107
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:59,448
I'm giving you an apartment
in one of my buildings...

108
00:06:59,517 --> 00:07:01,985
<i>at a very reasonable price.</i>

109
00:07:02,053 --> 00:07:03,987
That's very generous.
That's so nice.

110
00:07:04,055 --> 00:07:08,219
<i>[Oscar] See? I'm tough,</i>
<i>but I love my family.</i>

111
00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:12,896
This is so great.
This is so great!

112
00:07:12,964 --> 00:07:15,956
- Are you all right? Are you in shock?
- No!

113
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:18,627
You're gonna have
a fantastic wedding.

114
00:07:18,703 --> 00:07:20,637
Wait a minute.

115
00:07:20,705 --> 00:07:23,469
- What do you mean by fantastic?
- Wonderful.

116
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,135
- But not big and expensive?
- Gee, no.

117
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,644
When I say fantastic,
I mean cheap and ugly.

118
00:07:28,713 --> 00:07:31,341
You're our first daughter
getting married!

119
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:35,647
But Jake and I were thinking
of something really small.

120
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,779
<i>Maybe a few friends and family.</i>

121
00:07:37,855 --> 00:07:40,619
<i>[Jake] We'd like to acknowledge...</i>

122
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:44,149
- the different ethnic strains.
- Some Jewish food from Mom's side,

123
00:07:44,228 --> 00:07:47,129
<i>some Italian wine from your side.</i>

124
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:49,666
Anything you want, you've got.

125
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:52,862
There are wonderful things
from the Jewish ceremony.

126
00:07:52,937 --> 00:07:55,132
Jake could step on the glass.

127
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:57,766
They could carry you on chairs
like Grandma and me.

128
00:07:57,842 --> 00:07:59,776
They nearly dropped her.

129
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:06,282
[Chuckle]

130
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:11,944
- What do you think?
- He's a good kid. I like him.

131
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:14,491
I didn't know what you were thinking.

132
00:08:14,558 --> 00:08:16,423
You went into a trance.

133
00:08:16,494 --> 00:08:20,089
- I was excited.
- It looked like a trance.

134
00:08:21,198 --> 00:08:24,258
Did you see the look
on Connie's face?

135
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:26,701
This is kinda tough for her.

136
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:29,433
I don't know why
she can't find somebody.

137
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:32,237
- She's such an attractive woman.
- She's beautiful!

138
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:35,745
Has it anything to do with
the fact she carries a gun?

139
00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:38,577
It can really slow a guy down.

140
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:43,581
- So, listen.
- What?

141
00:08:43,654 --> 00:08:46,987
We have a wedding coming up now.

142
00:08:47,058 --> 00:08:50,550
We better not start
any new business deals.

143
00:08:50,628 --> 00:08:52,596
What do you mean, new?

144
00:08:52,663 --> 00:08:55,131
New. No new deals.

145
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:59,363
I just got a loan
on that house I'm building.

146
00:08:59,437 --> 00:09:03,134
I know, but maybe
we're overextending ourselves.

147
00:09:03,207 --> 00:09:06,540
- Get some advice from Oscar.
- Don't talk about Oscar.

148
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,511
I can't do this
if I'm thinking of Oscar.

149
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,140
I'm afraid we're gonna get caught...

150
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:15,447
in too many projects at one time.

151
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,545
We have to concentrate
on one thing at a time.

152
00:09:18,622 --> 00:09:21,250
I'm trying to.

153
00:09:27,231 --> 00:09:29,825
<i>[Eddie]</i>
<i>I want you to meet Jake's parents.</i>

154
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,266
Let me introduce you to my family.

155
00:09:32,336 --> 00:09:36,295
- My sister, Angelica.
- Hello, I'm Nancy.

156
00:09:36,373 --> 00:09:38,568
This is my mother, Rose.

157
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:41,270
Hello.
May we call you Rose?

158
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:44,178
What else are you gonna call me?

159
00:09:45,316 --> 00:09:48,217
- Please call us Nancy and Henry.
- Sure.

160
00:09:48,285 --> 00:09:50,253
Sit down.
You look half dead.

161
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:52,881
You want to sit over here on my left?

162
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:55,985
We would have been here sooner,

163
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,461
but Henry insisted on walking
to save cab fare.

164
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:03,591
You can walk
and save yourself a heart attack.

165
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:06,261
Henry has this thing
about self-discipline.

166
00:10:06,337 --> 00:10:09,397
Every time I go to his office,
he's lifting weights.

167
00:10:09,473 --> 00:10:11,532
Eddie, just a little.

168
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:14,203
Please!
So I die ten minutes earlier.

169
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:17,008
I ain't got much on my schedule.

170
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:19,174
Here's to Betsy and Jake.

171
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,241
Go get 'em, kids.

172
00:10:21,318 --> 00:10:23,548
- Salut'.
- Salut'.

173
00:10:23,621 --> 00:10:25,782
I'd like to make a toast
to the parents.

174
00:10:25,856 --> 00:10:29,314
This was a sudden announcement,
and you're taking it well.

175
00:10:29,393 --> 00:10:32,487
- [Angelica] <i>Cent'anni.</i>
- Is that...

176
00:10:32,563 --> 00:10:35,088
- 100 years.
- 100 years. <i>Cinzani?</i>

177
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,896
- No, Cinzano is a wine.
- I'm sorry.

178
00:10:37,968 --> 00:10:40,163
Your boyfriend, what does he do?

179
00:10:40,237 --> 00:10:43,400
He's in business with his father,
investment banking.

180
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:46,068
Oh. Hmm. What is that?

181
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,441
They buy companies and sell them.

182
00:10:48,512 --> 00:10:51,037
- They buy companies?
- Mm-hmm.

183
00:10:51,115 --> 00:10:53,049
- Companies?
- Yeah.

184
00:10:53,117 --> 00:10:54,846
Not bad.

185
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,853
When a deal goes your way,

186
00:10:56,921 --> 00:10:59,253
there's nothing like it in the world.

187
00:10:59,323 --> 00:11:02,349
- Well, you know better than I do.
- Oh, no.

188
00:11:02,426 --> 00:11:06,260
I just made a fantastic deal
to take over a house.

189
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,696
I tell you. I'm in heaven!

190
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:11,997
- I love the feeling.
- Great. Good for you, Ed.

191
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:14,367
What does he lift
at the office, couches?

192
00:11:14,438 --> 00:11:15,370
Shh.

193
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:18,408
Tell me, what is it that made you...

194
00:11:18,475 --> 00:11:21,376
decide to become a policewoman?

195
00:11:21,445 --> 00:11:23,379
I don't know.

196
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:25,677
I'm interested in law enforcement.

197
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:28,912
I want to work my way up
in the department.

198
00:11:28,986 --> 00:11:30,920
I'll tell you the truth.

199
00:11:30,988 --> 00:11:33,718
I just love arresting people.

200
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:37,591
- You do?
- God! Yeah.

201
00:11:37,661 --> 00:11:40,095
You push these guys
over the hood of a car,

202
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:42,962
kick their legs apart,
read 'em their rights;

203
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:45,934
I'm high for the rest of the day.

204
00:11:46,003 --> 00:11:47,994
Fabulous.

205
00:11:48,072 --> 00:11:50,768
They're bailing out
the Savings and Loans,

206
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:52,775
but not poor people.

207
00:11:52,843 --> 00:11:55,539
They have to set some priorities.

208
00:11:55,613 --> 00:11:58,582
The first priority
is the kid with no food.

209
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:01,140
Down at the bottom of the list...

210
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:03,948
is some guy who owns Texas.

211
00:12:04,021 --> 00:12:06,114
I think we should...

212
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,284
take the money that's
laying in the bank accounts...

213
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,056
and use that to put people to work.

214
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:15,030
Then give the depositors
a share of the earnings.

215
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:17,260
I think that would work great!

216
00:12:17,334 --> 00:12:20,963
- Don't you?
- Ah, um...

217
00:12:22,873 --> 00:12:25,103
I got an idea.

218
00:12:25,175 --> 00:12:28,508
Why don't we go to Ferrara's
and get some cannoli?

219
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:31,776
No-No-No. I have a wonderful bottle
of brandy at home.

220
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:35,012
Let's go to our place
and toast the kids.

221
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:36,177
Let's do that!

222
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:44,686
[Eddie] They got some house!

223
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:47,026
- Go easy on the bragging.
- All right.

224
00:12:47,097 --> 00:12:50,533
You should lighten up
on redistributing their wealth.

225
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:52,535
Fix your tie.

226
00:12:52,603 --> 00:12:54,503
This is a Bougeraux,

227
00:12:54,571 --> 00:12:57,301
<i>A Young Girl Defends Herself</i>
<i>Against Love.</i>

228
00:12:57,374 --> 00:12:59,467
So French, don't you think?
[Chuckle]

229
00:12:59,543 --> 00:13:03,001
The house was built in 1912,

230
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,312
and it was destroyed by fire in 1929.

231
00:13:07,384 --> 00:13:12,151
You have such a beautiful home.
Isn't it beautiful?

232
00:13:12,222 --> 00:13:15,419
Even my public library
don't look this good.

233
00:13:15,492 --> 00:13:18,859
Whoa! That must be
a bitch to clean.

234
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:21,454
I didn't do anything!

235
00:13:21,532 --> 00:13:23,932
Henry's just a little competitive.

236
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:27,198
He knows exactly
how many repetitions...

237
00:13:27,271 --> 00:13:29,933
every one of
his vice presidents can do.

238
00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:31,941
He's got the numbers taped here.

239
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:36,844
- Want to give it a go?
- Yeah, thank you.

240
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:39,178
Want me to take a little weight off?

241
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:40,944
No, I'm fine.

242
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:44,112
I think Jake's father is gonna
offer to pay for the wedding.

243
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:46,622
- He hinted at that.
- Pay for what?

244
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,407
You're just having
something small at home.

245
00:13:48,408 --> 00:13:49,523
I know.

246
00:13:49,593 --> 00:13:52,357
Don't forget to breathe.

247
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:55,125
- What did you say?
- Don't forget to breathe.

248
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,690
Oh, no. I was breathing.

249
00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:02,267
That's great to have in the house.

250
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:06,036
A wedding in a living room
is a <i>lovely</i> idea.

251
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:10,604
It's warm, friendly,
and so on and so forth.

252
00:14:10,681 --> 00:14:12,615
But let's face it.

253
00:14:12,683 --> 00:14:16,881
The good Lord has been
kind to Nancy and me.

254
00:14:16,954 --> 00:14:20,856
I've taken the liberty of
calling the Plaza hotel.

255
00:14:20,924 --> 00:14:24,257
With your permission,
I'm gonna give these kids...

256
00:14:24,328 --> 00:14:26,853
<i>a glorious wedding...</i>

257
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:30,764
- in a beautiful banquet room.
- Oh, bravo!

258
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:34,167
<i>[Angelica] My God, that's great.</i>

259
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:35,899
<i>[Eddie] I'm touched.</i>

260
00:14:35,973 --> 00:14:38,965
Really. That's a wonderful offer.

261
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:41,876
Lola and I've been lucky lately.

262
00:14:41,945 --> 00:14:44,505
We're actually gonna
throw these kids...

263
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:47,175
the grandest little
wedding anybody's seen.

264
00:14:47,251 --> 00:14:50,516
I know. It's just
we have these friends...

265
00:14:50,587 --> 00:14:54,216
that'd be insulted
if we didn't invite them.

266
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,556
We've got this gigantic family, too.

267
00:14:57,628 --> 00:14:59,721
I'm gonna get a catering hall.

268
00:14:59,797 --> 00:15:01,788
I'll tell you what.

269
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:04,459
I'll get the Grand Ballroom
with that dance band.

270
00:15:04,535 --> 00:15:08,062
No! I'm gonna get them a tent!

271
00:15:08,138 --> 00:15:10,470
This was supposed
to be a tiny wedding.

272
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,032
- We've got all these people.
- And we've got people.

273
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,271
I'm gonna put a big tent...

274
00:15:15,345 --> 00:15:18,542
<i>by this estate I'm building, ;
And we'll have music, dancing...</i>

275
00:15:18,615 --> 00:15:21,175
guys in white jackets,
the whole thing!

276
00:15:21,251 --> 00:15:23,549
Henry, I appreciate your offer,

277
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,386
but this is a pleasure
we've been waiting for.

278
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,755
<i>Right?</i>

279
00:15:28,826 --> 00:15:32,455
It just means too much to us.

280
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,057
You were like a couple of bulls,

281
00:15:36,127 --> 00:15:38,755
those mooses, locking horns.

282
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,458
It kept escalating,
like the arms race.

283
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:43,466
Why didn't you stop?

284
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:45,729
Didn't you feel me squeeze your arm?

285
00:15:45,803 --> 00:15:49,534
- I thought you were excited.
- I was having a heart attack.

286
00:15:49,607 --> 00:15:53,008
It went from a few people
at home to a three-ring circus.

287
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,568
- We can't pay for this.
- Sure, we can.

288
00:15:55,646 --> 00:15:58,240
We're in debt for that house,

289
00:15:58,316 --> 00:16:01,217
no money coming in
except for the nursery.

290
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:04,152
- You have to call Oscar.
- No, I don't.

291
00:16:04,222 --> 00:16:06,656
What are you saying "you don't" for?

292
00:16:06,724 --> 00:16:09,352
<i>[Eddie] I made this deal</i>
<i>to build this house on spec.</i>

293
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:12,089
It's an incredible deal, Oscar.

294
00:16:12,163 --> 00:16:15,064
It's gonna change my whole life.

295
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:17,499
That's wonderful.
Why did you...

296
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:19,502
cut it so short on top?

297
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,539
You gave me a shiny bald spot
like I'm wearing a miner's hat.

298
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:26,168
Betsy's getting married and
I've got a wedding to pay for.

299
00:16:26,244 --> 00:16:28,109
You're in a squeeze.

300
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:30,704
They want you on the site.
Georgie.

301
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:33,717
Georgie? Come.
We'll talk on the way.

302
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,185
Oscar, all I need is $30,000.

303
00:16:36,254 --> 00:16:38,688
You're the only one who can help me.

304
00:16:38,756 --> 00:16:42,021
By marriage,
you're my flesh and blood.

305
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:44,027
- Of course I'll help.
- That's great.

306
00:16:44,095 --> 00:16:46,586
- What've you got for collateral?
- Collateral?

307
00:16:46,664 --> 00:16:47,596
Collateral.

308
00:16:47,665 --> 00:16:51,761
Okay, I can cut you in on
the house I'm building.

309
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:53,497
This is good.

310
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:56,563
I'll give you a percentage of
what I make on the spec house.

311
00:16:56,641 --> 00:17:00,042
- Good.
- I can give you 15%, 20%.

312
00:17:00,111 --> 00:17:03,911
- This is possible. 20%, 30% is good.
- 20, 15, anything.

313
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,949
- 30%, whatever.
- Let's say 20%.

314
00:17:06,017 --> 00:17:07,917
<i>[Oscar] 20%, but I have</i>
<i>to charge interest.</i>

315
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,249
Eddie, do me a favor.

316
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,881
Take a cab. I can't talk now.

317
00:17:12,957 --> 00:17:15,084
- I have some... I'm busy.
- Oscar,

318
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,993
wait till you see this house...
it's fantastic!

319
00:17:19,063 --> 00:17:22,123
Georgie, I'm so glad you're here.

320
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,601
- This project gonna be on time?
- Of course.

321
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,604
Let me show you around.

322
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,867
This is my brother's boy, Stevie Dee.

323
00:17:29,941 --> 00:17:32,375
<i>Stevie Dee, say hello.</i>

324
00:17:32,443 --> 00:17:34,968
<i>[Oscar] Nice lookin' boy.</i>
<i>Looks like you.</i>

325
00:17:35,046 --> 00:17:36,980
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

326
00:17:37,048 --> 00:17:39,278
He's a good boy.
Very polite.

327
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,875
I'd like him to learn
the construction business.

328
00:17:41,953 --> 00:17:45,889
He's had a little experience
on a couple of bridges.

329
00:17:45,957 --> 00:17:47,857
He could be your assistant.

330
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:50,450
Give him a couple of grand a week
and he'll be happy.

331
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,519
Wonderful!
I could use the help.

332
00:17:52,597 --> 00:17:56,055
- He's a good boy. You, don't fuck up.
- Absolutely not.

333
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:59,933
You fuck up, and you're back
in the deli behind the counter.

334
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:04,501
Come over here, you.

335
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:06,805
Not you, him.

336
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:09,438
I'll wait here, Georgie.

337
00:18:09,514 --> 00:18:13,109
- Are you carrying a piece?
- It's okay. I got a license.

338
00:18:13,184 --> 00:18:15,311
Didn't your father tell you nothing?

339
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:19,379
You wanna be like me,
you gotta be like a businessman.

340
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:23,393
We do things with pencils, erasers.

341
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:26,259
You understand what I'm saying?

342
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:29,527
Erasers.
Sure, I understand.

343
00:18:31,202 --> 00:18:33,898
<i>That's a nice looking boy, Georgie.</i>

344
00:18:33,971 --> 00:18:36,735
He's a good boy.
A little enthusiastic.

345
00:18:36,807 --> 00:18:40,174
I got your check.
I appreciate your punctuality.

346
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,439
There's more we could do together.

347
00:18:42,513 --> 00:18:44,572
- We oughta talk.
- We'll see.

348
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:47,413
You make me proud, huh?

349
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,817
See ya, Georgie.
Thanks for coming by.

350
00:18:56,627 --> 00:18:59,425
[Oscar] I'm thinking of how
I could use your talents.

351
00:18:59,497 --> 00:19:01,362
I don't want to waste you.

352
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:05,232
My brother-in-law is building
a home on Long Island.

353
00:19:05,303 --> 00:19:08,704
I have an interest.
You could watch over it.

354
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,707
You know, check up on things.

355
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:14,040
Wherever you want me
to go, I'm your man.

356
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,238
You'll be sensational on Long Island.

357
00:19:16,314 --> 00:19:18,976
Long Island is your kind of place!

358
00:19:21,819 --> 00:19:25,516
- <i>Eddie, it is beautiful!</i>
- <i>Didn't I tell you?</i>

359
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,454
A great house.

360
00:19:26,524 --> 00:19:29,152
It'll be a pleasure
to give you this check.

361
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:32,093
Dad, what is this?
The living room?

362
00:19:32,163 --> 00:19:35,621
- <i>No, that's the kitchen.</i>
- <i>It's like a mansion.</i>

363
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,330
<i>[Oscar] Use a cheaper grade</i>
<i>of wood. They'll never see it.</i>

364
00:19:40,404 --> 00:19:42,736
How much are the carpenters costing?

365
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:46,106
Not much.
They've been with me.

366
00:19:46,177 --> 00:19:49,977
- You pay health insurance?
- It's hard to get good guys.

367
00:19:50,047 --> 00:19:52,777
This project's gonna fail big.

368
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,216
- You're a softie, a pussy.
- I'm not.

369
00:19:55,286 --> 00:19:58,278
<i>You gotta say,</i>
<i>"I'm the farmer, they're the cows."</i>

370
00:19:58,356 --> 00:20:00,051
- <i>Stevie Dee?</i>
- <i>Here.</i>

371
00:20:00,124 --> 00:20:02,922
<i>[Oscar] You're not gonna run wild.</i>

372
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:05,292
<i>Stevie Dee's gonna watch over.</i>

373
00:20:05,363 --> 00:20:09,197
- Be here 8 a.m. Report to me.
- Absolutely.

374
00:20:09,266 --> 00:20:13,430
- You, don't be a pussy!
- I'm not gonna be a pussy or a cow.

375
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,870
I'm gonna be a mean son of a bitch!

376
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,669
<i>I'm gonna be a real prick</i>
<i>just like you.</i>

377
00:20:17,742 --> 00:20:20,438
I hope so!

378
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:24,845
One crappy fish market isn't
going to hold up a major parcel.

379
00:20:24,915 --> 00:20:27,543
Tell him somebody else
is gonna buy it.

380
00:20:27,618 --> 00:20:30,587
I was observing the site
while you were talking.

381
00:20:30,655 --> 00:20:31,781
Good. You'll learn.

382
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:35,883
I think Uncle Georgie
would be very interested.

383
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,394
He does business in the millions.

384
00:20:38,462 --> 00:20:42,364
- Why would he be interested?
- I'd like to talk to him.

385
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:46,267
- It's extremely interesting.
- Whatever.

386
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,896
<i>[Knocking]</i>

387
00:20:54,612 --> 00:20:56,409
Excuse me.

388
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,148
Everything all right?

389
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:02,811
I came as soon as I got your message.

390
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:06,118
I want to speak concerning
my nephew, Stevie Dee.

391
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,988
He's doing great.
A wonderful young man.

392
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,551
He wants to emulate me.

393
00:21:11,629 --> 00:21:14,621
He's thinking,
"What would Uncle Georgie do?"

394
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:17,327
What could I do?
He's my brother's boy.

395
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,766
Naturally.

396
00:21:18,836 --> 00:21:23,296
He sees your brother-in-law's
construction site.

397
00:21:23,374 --> 00:21:26,502
He says, "Uncle Georgie
could move some money here."

398
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,102
He's trying to please me.
You understand?

399
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,547
Sure, being your nephew
and everything.

400
00:21:32,616 --> 00:21:34,811
To me, I'm not that interested.

401
00:21:34,885 --> 00:21:38,116
But my brother's boy,
what the hell? Understand?

402
00:21:38,189 --> 00:21:41,886
- So, therefore...
- <i>Right.</i>

403
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:44,553
Talk to your brother-in-law.

404
00:21:44,628 --> 00:21:46,425
Right.

405
00:21:46,497 --> 00:21:49,295
How should I phrase it?

406
00:21:49,366 --> 00:21:53,462
Like this.
"Stevie Dee likes your house."

407
00:21:53,537 --> 00:21:57,837
- Stevie Dee likes my house, so what?
- <i>What do you mean?</i>

408
00:21:57,908 --> 00:22:00,809
- You got a sale.
- I got a sale?

409
00:22:00,878 --> 00:22:05,281
He wants to give you $300,000
on top of what it costs you.

410
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:08,182
Where's a kid gonna get
that kind of money?

411
00:22:08,252 --> 00:22:11,483
He's got the backing of his uncle,
an associate of mine.

412
00:22:11,555 --> 00:22:12,487
$300,000?

413
00:22:12,556 --> 00:22:16,219
It's not just the house.
It could be the development.

414
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,386
You realize what
this could mean for us?

415
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,589
Shopping centers! Malls!

416
00:22:20,664 --> 00:22:23,189
Office buildings!
Complexes of buildings!

417
00:22:23,267 --> 00:22:25,963
<i>Eddie, if we have</i>
<i>these people behind us,</i>

418
00:22:26,036 --> 00:22:28,197
<i>we can really take off.</i>

419
00:22:28,272 --> 00:22:31,969
<i>These people have money.</i>
<i>We could make millions.</i>

420
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:34,909
<i>We'll be moving all over;</i>
<i>The Northeast, Southwest!</i>

421
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,038
- <i>I'm telling you!</i>
- Oscar,

422
00:22:37,114 --> 00:22:39,207
there's no end to what
we could accomplish.

423
00:22:39,283 --> 00:22:40,944
I'm in.

424
00:22:46,423 --> 00:22:48,084
Dad?

425
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:59,267
- May I be of assistance?
- Is my dad here?

426
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:02,032
No, I'm sorry,
not at the present time.

427
00:23:02,106 --> 00:23:04,904
Is there any way in which I can help?

428
00:23:04,975 --> 00:23:07,409
<i>I'm Stevie Dee,</i>
<i>Mr. Henner's associate.</i>

429
00:23:07,478 --> 00:23:09,878
Hi. Tell him I came by...

430
00:23:09,947 --> 00:23:13,110
with tapes of bands for the wedding.

431
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,812
By the way, I can help you with that.

432
00:23:15,886 --> 00:23:19,014
I know several people
in the music business.

433
00:23:19,089 --> 00:23:22,616
I guess if these don't work out,

434
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:25,321
I'll be looking for other ideas.

435
00:23:25,396 --> 00:23:27,830
I could take you
to hear some of these bands.

436
00:23:27,898 --> 00:23:31,163
It might help you
to hear them in person.

437
00:23:31,235 --> 00:23:34,534
Maybe.
I work very long hours.

438
00:23:34,605 --> 00:23:36,732
I'm a police officer.

439
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:40,268
Police officer.

440
00:23:40,344 --> 00:23:41,606
Yeah.

441
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,080
Police officer?

442
00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:47,140
That's right.

443
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:50,654
I have several friends
in the police force.

444
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:54,122
- What precinct?
- 14th. Midtown Manhattan.

445
00:23:54,191 --> 00:23:56,625
I'm more familiar with Downtown.

446
00:23:56,694 --> 00:24:00,221
It was a pleasure
to meet you, Miss hopper.

447
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:02,663
Nice meeting you.

448
00:24:04,468 --> 00:24:08,336
Your sister's wedding
is a wonderful thing.

449
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,272
<i>I wish her all my best.</i>

450
00:24:13,782 --> 00:24:18,014
- <i>What's wrong with a tent?</i>
- <i>We can't afford a $ 7,000 tent.</i>

451
00:24:18,086 --> 00:24:20,782
We have to save money.
I'm doing the flowers.

452
00:24:20,856 --> 00:24:23,654
We got money coming soon.
Let's splurge.

453
00:24:23,725 --> 00:24:26,694
- How many daughters have we got?
- Two.

454
00:24:26,761 --> 00:24:28,922
How are we gonna make it
to the second one?

455
00:24:28,997 --> 00:24:29,861
Nobody likes her.

456
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:33,697
Oscar and Gloria had a tent
for their anniversary.

457
00:24:33,768 --> 00:24:37,135
There have to be cheaper tents.
Ask Oscar, please.

458
00:24:37,205 --> 00:24:39,230
$7,000? Are you crazy?

459
00:24:39,307 --> 00:24:41,969
- I can get one for half that price.
- Where?

460
00:24:42,043 --> 00:24:44,375
Eddie, I'm a successful businessman.

461
00:24:44,446 --> 00:24:46,914
I know a lot of people
who know people!

462
00:24:46,982 --> 00:24:50,349
I can take care of it.
Let me get to work.

463
00:24:50,418 --> 00:24:53,945
Look, I want a nice, white tent,

464
00:24:54,022 --> 00:24:56,183
not some circus tent.

465
00:24:56,258 --> 00:24:59,716
Relax. It's gonna be
a beautiful tent,

466
00:24:59,794 --> 00:25:03,195
and a glorious, wonderful
wedding... trust me.

467
00:25:03,265 --> 00:25:05,358
Trust me!

468
00:25:07,102 --> 00:25:09,400
- <i>Trust me!</i>
- All right. Okay.

469
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:13,437
[Argumentative Chatter]

470
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,304
- Dad, how many do you have?
- 85.

471
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,644
- I knew it!
- No, wait, wait.

472
00:25:20,715 --> 00:25:23,741
You invite 'em,
but they won't all come.

473
00:25:23,818 --> 00:25:26,446
- Where should I put this?
- Over there.

474
00:25:26,521 --> 00:25:29,081
Ma, if we invite the DiNapolis,

475
00:25:29,157 --> 00:25:31,455
then we gotta ask all the cousins.

476
00:25:31,526 --> 00:25:34,359
<i>Maybe we should just</i>
<i>stick with the Cerrilos.</i>

477
00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:36,761
You want to put out the good glasses?

478
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:39,061
We bought 'em in Moreno, Italy.

479
00:25:39,134 --> 00:25:41,159
Turns out they were made in China.

480
00:25:41,236 --> 00:25:43,636
I could've gone to Mott Street,
the son of a bitch.

481
00:25:43,705 --> 00:25:45,639
Put this in the kitchen.

482
00:25:45,707 --> 00:25:48,801
I'll do that.
We need more chairs...

483
00:25:48,877 --> 00:25:50,868
from in there.

484
00:25:50,946 --> 00:25:53,346
- I like that boy.
- Me, too.

485
00:25:53,415 --> 00:25:55,349
- Does he cook?
- Not too much.

486
00:25:55,417 --> 00:25:59,217
You're lucky.
Let him take out the garbage.

487
00:25:59,287 --> 00:26:02,654
When your grandfather was alive,
remember, Angelica?

488
00:26:02,724 --> 00:26:05,215
I couldn't keep him
out of my kitchen.

489
00:26:05,293 --> 00:26:07,557
<i>He didn't know how to cook.</i>

490
00:26:07,629 --> 00:26:10,757
<i>He'd use every pot</i>
<i>to make one little thing.</i>

491
00:26:10,832 --> 00:26:13,357
<i>The oregano!</i>
<i>He didn't know what he was doing!</i>

492
00:26:13,435 --> 00:26:18,168
She threw me out of the kitchen
because I was a better cook.

493
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:19,638
<i>It drove her crazy.</i>

494
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:22,939
She couldn't figure out why
my manicotti was so delicious.

495
00:26:23,011 --> 00:26:27,141
She'd pump me.
"Did you add oregano, nutmeg?"

496
00:26:27,215 --> 00:26:31,914
I wouldn't tell.
You know the secret?

497
00:26:31,987 --> 00:26:35,479
I used three different cheeses,
but which three?

498
00:26:36,825 --> 00:26:41,159
When I died, I took that
recipe to the grave.

499
00:26:41,229 --> 00:26:44,221
What's the wedding gown like?
Did Betsy design it?

500
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:46,597
- No.
- Thank God.

501
00:26:46,668 --> 00:26:49,660
Show Grandma the picture
of your wedding gown.

502
00:26:49,738 --> 00:26:52,673
Oh, you brought it.
Let me see it.

503
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:54,800
This is what Mom and I settled on...

504
00:26:54,876 --> 00:26:57,344
after a lot of negotiation:

505
00:26:57,412 --> 00:26:59,812
Lace around the bodice
and a plunging back.

506
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:03,044
That not only plunges,
it dive-bombs.

507
00:27:03,118 --> 00:27:04,710
That's the part I like.

508
00:27:04,786 --> 00:27:07,448
After the floor show, what do we eat?

509
00:27:07,522 --> 00:27:10,855
We're working out the menu.
We haven't quite decided.

510
00:27:10,925 --> 00:27:13,223
- As long as there's no meat.
- No meat?

511
00:27:13,294 --> 00:27:15,854
What are you talking about?

512
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:18,194
Jake and I don't want any meat.

513
00:27:18,266 --> 00:27:20,496
- No meat?
- They're vegetarian.

514
00:27:20,568 --> 00:27:24,368
These people are gonna
give you money. Give 'em food.

515
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:26,532
Make sure your mother
doesn't cook it.

516
00:27:26,608 --> 00:27:28,633
I'm pretty sure that's how I died.

517
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,200
<i>[Eddie] Hold it!</i>

518
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:33,736
All you have to do
is show up, hold hands,

519
00:27:33,815 --> 00:27:36,113
and the priest will
pronounce you man and wife.

520
00:27:36,184 --> 00:27:38,345
Husband and wife.
Man and wife is sexist.

521
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:42,686
- There won't be a priest.
- No meat, no priest.

522
00:27:42,757 --> 00:27:45,851
What did you say?
No priest?

523
00:27:45,927 --> 00:27:49,693
- We don't want to offend.
- Grandma, we hope you'll understand,

524
00:27:49,764 --> 00:27:51,823
but we don't want to be hypocrites.

525
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,495
What the hell kind of a wedding
is it without a priest?

526
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,802
<i>We could ask our cousin,</i>
<i>Father Sal, to do the ceremony.</i>

527
00:27:59,874 --> 00:28:02,035
Would we have to mention God?

528
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,943
They teach them to say God
every ten seconds.

529
00:28:05,013 --> 00:28:08,039
Ma, don't get excited.

530
00:28:08,116 --> 00:28:12,348
Where are you going to find
a priest who doesn't say God?

531
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,912
Are you going to step on the glass?

532
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,084
- Does it have religious meaning?
- I don't think so.

533
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,129
It's a wonderful moment
in a Jewish wedding.

534
00:28:22,197 --> 00:28:25,564
The groom breaks the glass,
and everybody cheers.

535
00:28:25,633 --> 00:28:27,931
I've always pictured you doing that.

536
00:28:28,002 --> 00:28:31,233
You gotta step on the glass.
Do it for Mom.

537
00:28:31,306 --> 00:28:33,797
What did you ever do for your mom?

538
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:36,935
He said, "Ma, kids
don't listen to their parents."

539
00:28:37,011 --> 00:28:40,037
You're getting it back.
See how it feels?

540
00:28:42,951 --> 00:28:45,647
Could we cover her back with lace?

541
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,847
You'll need a lot of lace.

542
00:28:47,922 --> 00:28:50,447
I don't want to cover my back.

543
00:28:50,525 --> 00:28:52,618
They'll see plenty through the lace.

544
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:59,259
This is so beautiful on you.
Isn't she beautiful?

545
00:29:00,435 --> 00:29:03,029
What's her thing about
covering up my back?

546
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,073
This is a conventional dress.
I hate it!

547
00:29:06,141 --> 00:29:08,974
One thing makes it unique.
What's wrong with that?

548
00:29:09,944 --> 00:29:12,208
<i>What's the matter?</i>

549
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,545
Nothing. It's stupid.

550
00:29:15,617 --> 00:29:18,245
<i>[Lola] I'm not sure if this was...</i>

551
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:21,846
the piece that I saw...
what happened?

552
00:29:21,923 --> 00:29:23,857
- What happened?
- Nothing.

553
00:29:23,925 --> 00:29:26,689
Nothing!
Just... go ahead.

554
00:29:33,434 --> 00:29:36,528
- Oh, yes! Beautiful.
- Mm. No.

555
00:29:36,604 --> 00:29:40,700
Then we put this and we see how...

556
00:29:40,775 --> 00:29:46,008
That's beautiful!
Isn't she beautiful?

557
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:51,977
Oh, ah...

558
00:29:58,793 --> 00:30:00,761
how ya doin'?

559
00:30:00,828 --> 00:30:03,797
This whole wedding thing
is getting really stupid!

560
00:30:03,865 --> 00:30:05,799
What's that?

561
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:08,734
<i>Your father sent a tape</i>
<i>of a band his cousin has.</i>

562
00:30:08,803 --> 00:30:11,101
<i>They do traditional wedding stuff.</i>

563
00:30:11,172 --> 00:30:14,335
Everybody has got this
emotional investment.

564
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:17,606
Connie took one look at me
in my wedding dress,

565
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,341
and starts crying hysterically.

566
00:30:20,415 --> 00:30:22,474
You don't look that bad.

567
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,017
Thanks!

568
00:30:24,085 --> 00:30:27,020
It's getting to me.
We should sneak off.

569
00:30:27,088 --> 00:30:31,684
Great. There's no
water in the kitchen.

570
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:35,718
- Is there any in the bathroom?
- I can't get the super.

571
00:30:35,797 --> 00:30:39,392
I hate this place.
It's making me crazy!

572
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:45,369
<i>% % % % [TV; "The Stripper"]</i>

573
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,637
What's he doing?

574
00:30:50,211 --> 00:30:53,578
<i>[Jake] Seems like</i>
<i>a pretty sophisticated band.</i>

575
00:30:53,648 --> 00:30:57,982
No hands now.
Take that garter off!

576
00:30:58,052 --> 00:31:02,011
If he plays at our wedding, he goes
home with a sax up his ass.

577
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:06,884
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

578
00:31:06,961 --> 00:31:11,455
- I'd have had someone up there!
- We tell the super.

579
00:31:11,532 --> 00:31:14,524
His hearing only responds
to $50 bills.

580
00:31:14,602 --> 00:31:16,133
I will not have
my niece and nephew...

581
00:31:16,204 --> 00:31:18,438
living in conditions like that.

582
00:31:18,506 --> 00:31:20,565
Call me, and don't be shy!

583
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,550
[Ringing] Hello?

584
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:40,645
Hi.
Are you eating home tonight?

585
00:31:40,722 --> 00:31:42,781
Remember this fish market?

586
00:31:42,858 --> 00:31:46,157
I have to take the
fish-market guy to dinner.

587
00:31:46,228 --> 00:31:49,459
He's trying to outmaneuver me.
I gotta romance him.

588
00:31:49,531 --> 00:31:51,294
Uh-huh.

589
00:31:51,366 --> 00:31:53,857
I'm taking him to
this French restaurant.

590
00:31:53,936 --> 00:31:56,029
I hate it, all that rich food.

591
00:31:56,104 --> 00:31:59,437
- Make a good deal.
- I will.

592
00:31:59,508 --> 00:32:02,068
- Don't get screwed.
- Okay.

593
00:32:04,913 --> 00:32:06,642
Time for dinner!

594
00:32:10,385 --> 00:32:12,853
Oscar,

595
00:32:12,921 --> 00:32:15,754
we have to discuss our relationship.

596
00:32:15,824 --> 00:32:19,817
I can't have an impersonal,
high-pressure day with you,

597
00:32:19,895 --> 00:32:23,626
then eat and make love,
all in half an hour.

598
00:32:23,699 --> 00:32:26,065
You think I'm trying to make love?

599
00:32:26,134 --> 00:32:28,967
Let's not insult my intelligence.

600
00:32:29,037 --> 00:32:32,529
Ordinarily, you sit, I serve.

601
00:32:32,608 --> 00:32:34,940
You talk, I listen.

602
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,501
When you put the Moo Shu Pork
on the paper plates,

603
00:32:37,579 --> 00:32:41,071
it's a sure sign
I'm gonna get <i>shtupped.</i>

604
00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:44,949
Where'd a nice Presbyterian
girl pick up words like that?

605
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,580
From you while you were <i>shtupping</i> me.

606
00:32:47,656 --> 00:32:51,251
Oscar, how do you think
that makes me feel?

607
00:32:51,326 --> 00:32:54,022
How do you think I feel?

608
00:32:54,096 --> 00:32:58,192
Great, judging from the smug look
on your face.

609
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,825
You make me happy.

610
00:32:59,902 --> 00:33:03,099
What do you want from me
after we make love?

611
00:33:03,171 --> 00:33:07,267
I'd like a little talk,
human contact.

612
00:33:07,342 --> 00:33:09,606
Honey,

613
00:33:09,678 --> 00:33:13,808
it breaks my heart to have
to steal these little moments.

614
00:33:13,882 --> 00:33:17,716
It won't be this way for long.
When I tell Gloria about us,

615
00:33:17,786 --> 00:33:20,778
we'll be able to go
to real restaurants.

616
00:33:20,856 --> 00:33:24,587
Tell her? This is something
you're planning to <i>do?</i>

617
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:28,460
I can't tell her now.
She has a gallbladder condition.

618
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:31,158
It might kill her.

619
00:33:31,233 --> 00:33:35,226
I don't know how I'd get
through this without you.

620
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:38,501
You've been wonderful
through the whole thing.

621
00:33:39,508 --> 00:33:41,874
You know,

622
00:33:41,944 --> 00:33:44,777
I'm not really hungry anymore.

623
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:50,348
Okay. We'll use
the time to talk.

624
00:33:52,721 --> 00:33:55,849
How'd your dinner go tonight?

625
00:33:55,924 --> 00:33:59,519
- I didn't exactly get what I wanted.
- What a shame.

626
00:33:59,595 --> 00:34:02,996
I said, "$500,000.
That's my last offer."

627
00:34:03,065 --> 00:34:05,158
I'll let 'em dangle a while.

628
00:34:05,233 --> 00:34:07,724
I'm willing to go higher.

629
00:34:07,803 --> 00:34:10,431
This is the fish market
we're talking about?

630
00:34:10,505 --> 00:34:12,200
<i>Yes.</i>

631
00:34:12,274 --> 00:34:15,209
How high are you willing to go?

632
00:34:15,277 --> 00:34:17,905
If I have to, $1,200,000.

633
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,743
You're clever.

634
00:34:19,815 --> 00:34:23,046
- I've been doing this.
- <i>You really need this land...</i>

635
00:34:23,118 --> 00:34:26,781
- or the project falls apart.
- <i>He doesn't know that.</i>

636
00:34:26,855 --> 00:34:29,653
What if he just won't sell?

637
00:34:29,725 --> 00:34:32,990
$1,500,000.
That's as high as I'll go.

638
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:40,999
I gotta get some sleep.
I got a big day tomorrow.

639
00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:43,128
Oscar, I don't know how you do it.

640
00:34:43,205 --> 00:34:44,968
- Good night.
- <i>Good night.</i>

641
00:34:46,174 --> 00:34:48,369
- <i>[Doorbell]</i>
- I'll get it.

642
00:34:48,443 --> 00:34:50,911
<i>[Nancy]</i>
<i>Thank you. I just need a second.</i>

643
00:34:52,214 --> 00:34:53,875
- Hi.
- Hi.

644
00:34:59,221 --> 00:35:01,746
What do you think?
Is it too weird?

645
00:35:01,823 --> 00:35:04,656
- What?
- My dress.

646
00:35:04,726 --> 00:35:07,320
I don't want to freak
your mother out.

647
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,229
Well, it's different.

648
00:35:10,298 --> 00:35:12,926
It's great.
It's just different.

649
00:35:13,001 --> 00:35:16,164
Do you think
it's too much for the opera?

650
00:35:16,238 --> 00:35:18,138
- No.
- <i>I've worked all week.</i>

651
00:35:18,206 --> 00:35:22,506
Last night, I took it apart
and did it over.

652
00:35:22,577 --> 00:35:24,602
I'm all set.

653
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,444
Betsy, what a dress!

654
00:35:27,516 --> 00:35:29,711
What a dress!

655
00:35:29,785 --> 00:35:32,345
I'll get Henry.
He's having a bite.

656
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,355
You look smashing!

657
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,721
Henry, Betsy's here.

658
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:41,161
She looks like an explosion
in a dress factory.

659
00:35:41,229 --> 00:35:43,424
It can't be that bad.

660
00:35:48,003 --> 00:35:50,563
Kaboom!
Hey! Wow!

661
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:53,506
You know, it gets cold
there at night.

662
00:35:53,575 --> 00:35:57,568
You should have something
around your shoulders.

663
00:35:57,646 --> 00:36:01,878
This would look sensational
with that outfit.

664
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,111
Oh, fabulous.

665
00:36:04,186 --> 00:36:06,120
I'll get my purse and we'll go.

666
00:36:06,188 --> 00:36:08,383
- Thank you. It really...
- <i>[Door Closes]</i>

667
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,288
Covers my dress.

668
00:36:10,358 --> 00:36:12,553
My parents aren't free spirits.

669
00:36:12,627 --> 00:36:15,619
Being creative is
buying low and selling high.

670
00:36:15,697 --> 00:36:19,861
Maybe next time
you could pull back a little?

671
00:36:19,935 --> 00:36:22,870
Wear something a little squarer?

672
00:36:22,938 --> 00:36:27,136
My clothes are like this.
I'll spend my life in this cape.

673
00:36:27,209 --> 00:36:31,009
Be creative, just don't
let it show so much.

674
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,344
You'll have an easier time with them.

675
00:36:34,416 --> 00:36:36,782
Let's go.
We don't want to be late.

676
00:36:36,852 --> 00:36:39,821
You look fabulous in that cape.

677
00:36:39,888 --> 00:36:41,412
Fabulous.

678
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,788
- You okay?
- Fabulous.

679
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:48,592
[Betsy] he's too damn worried
about what his parents think.

680
00:36:48,663 --> 00:36:52,793
They're gonna be unhappy
with parts of the wedding.

681
00:36:52,868 --> 00:36:54,802
You marry each other,

682
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,532
but have to worry about other people.

683
00:36:57,606 --> 00:37:01,269
- Our wedding was like that.
- How?

684
00:37:01,343 --> 00:37:03,208
Dad didn't want to hurt his family...

685
00:37:03,278 --> 00:37:06,076
by getting married in a synagogue.

686
00:37:06,148 --> 00:37:09,606
I didn't want to hurt mine
by marrying in a church.

687
00:37:09,684 --> 00:37:12,778
That's why we went
to the Justice of the Peace.

688
00:37:12,854 --> 00:37:15,015
Five minutes in a dingy office.

689
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:19,117
- That must've been awful.
- We both felt disappointed.

690
00:37:19,194 --> 00:37:22,186
That's why he's making
a production of yours.

691
00:37:22,264 --> 00:37:25,324
You never got to step
on the glass or anything?

692
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,231
No.
I missed that.

693
00:37:27,302 --> 00:37:29,463
We came from different backgrounds.

694
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,836
It's hard to make them mesh.

695
00:37:31,907 --> 00:37:35,172
I realize how different
Jake and I are.

696
00:37:35,243 --> 00:37:38,110
- We're really different!
- Yeah!

697
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:42,116
Different is good.
Dad and I are different.

698
00:37:42,184 --> 00:37:47,121
I'd like some cabbage soup,
sour cream. He eats...

699
00:37:47,189 --> 00:37:50,681
salami and hot peppers
with eggplant and gorgonzola.

700
00:37:50,759 --> 00:37:52,954
This is what they feed
to laboratory animals...

701
00:37:53,028 --> 00:37:55,258
when they want to
pump their stomachs.

702
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:59,130
When you're just like someone,
it can be so boring.

703
00:38:02,037 --> 00:38:05,131
<i>I never realized how much</i>
<i>Jake and I are different.</i>

704
00:38:05,207 --> 00:38:08,506
<i>Now I'm starting to get worried.</i>

705
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:11,273
<i>Jake's family isn't loose like ours.</i>

706
00:38:11,346 --> 00:38:13,644
When we go out to eat,

707
00:38:13,715 --> 00:38:16,946
Jake checks to make sure
he's eating with the right forks.

708
00:38:17,018 --> 00:38:18,986
- Me, I just eat.
- <i>That doesn't matter.</i>

709
00:38:19,054 --> 00:38:21,648
I like music.
It puts Dad to sleep.

710
00:38:21,723 --> 00:38:23,384
I like peace and quiet.

711
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:25,892
To him, life's an amusement park.

712
00:38:25,961 --> 00:38:30,057
After a while, you start
to realize that <i>that</i> is fun.

713
00:38:30,131 --> 00:38:32,258
That it's fun to be different.

714
00:38:32,334 --> 00:38:35,667
You complement each other,
learn from one another.

715
00:38:35,737 --> 00:38:39,571
<i>It's really very stimulating...</i>

716
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:42,439
to see life
from a different point of view.

717
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,536
To introduce each other
to new things.

718
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,582
- Oh!
- [Gasp]

719
00:38:47,649 --> 00:38:49,708
Oh, my goodness!

720
00:38:49,784 --> 00:38:53,845
- Do you want to kill yourself?
- Let's go home.

721
00:38:53,922 --> 00:38:56,356
Why can't you do one thing at a time?

722
00:38:56,424 --> 00:38:57,356
I'm fine.

723
00:38:57,425 --> 00:38:58,790
<i>Why do you want to hurt yourself?</i>

724
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:02,660
- You have children.
- I'm okay.

725
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:05,564
I am not coming back here again!

726
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:09,229
Do I have to see you fall
on your head or something?

727
00:39:09,304 --> 00:39:11,738
This illustrates my point.

728
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,669
Good night.

729
00:39:38,165 --> 00:39:39,564
Hold it!
I'm a police officer.

730
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:42,397
Good evening. Stevie Dee.

731
00:39:42,469 --> 00:39:45,597
You scared me.
All I heard was footsteps.

732
00:39:45,673 --> 00:39:47,766
<i>Sorry if I upset you.</i>

733
00:39:47,841 --> 00:39:51,709
Perhaps you'd like a little dinner?

734
00:39:51,779 --> 00:39:54,270
- It's midnight.
- I understand.

735
00:39:54,348 --> 00:39:58,444
Since you get off a long shift,
you might be a little hungry.

736
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:00,510
No, thanks.
I gotta get home.

737
00:40:00,588 --> 00:40:02,317
<i>I don't want to impose.</i>

738
00:40:02,389 --> 00:40:06,485
I just want you to know
that I'm at your service.

739
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,494
If you need anything,

740
00:40:08,562 --> 00:40:12,521
<i>if anybody ever bothers you,</i>
<i>even in the smallest way,</i>

741
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,534
please call me.

742
00:40:14,602 --> 00:40:16,968
I'm a cop.

743
00:40:17,037 --> 00:40:20,268
If anybody bothers me, I arrest them.

744
00:40:20,341 --> 00:40:23,606
Naturally.
I just want you...

745
00:40:23,677 --> 00:40:26,168
Excuse me.

746
00:40:27,715 --> 00:40:31,276
I want you to know
that I am at your service.

747
00:40:31,352 --> 00:40:33,286
I'm not ashamed to say this.

748
00:40:33,354 --> 00:40:35,754
I think a man should reveal
this kind of thing.

749
00:40:35,823 --> 00:40:39,259
I think about you all the time.

750
00:40:41,095 --> 00:40:44,360
Can I give you a lift?
Get you a taxi?

751
00:40:44,431 --> 00:40:48,390
No. I'll be fine.
Thank you.

752
00:40:52,072 --> 00:40:54,040
Thank you.

753
00:41:01,515 --> 00:41:05,110
% % ["America The Beautiful"]

754
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:15,628
<i>[Henry] Did the kids tell you</i>
<i>about the apartment?</i>

755
00:41:15,696 --> 00:41:16,526
No. What?

756
00:41:16,597 --> 00:41:19,395
I got around to going
to their new place.

757
00:41:19,466 --> 00:41:21,991
It's cute. The thing is,

758
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:26,130
I can get them a fabulous
Eastside apartment.

759
00:41:26,206 --> 00:41:29,175
I'll buy it and rent it to them.

760
00:41:29,243 --> 00:41:32,644
I need your help
in telling Uncle Oscar.

761
00:41:32,713 --> 00:41:37,343
I said, "Your honeymoon
is something you'll remember.

762
00:41:37,418 --> 00:41:41,821
"The <i>Georges Cinq</i> in Paris
or the Villa D'Este on Lake Como.

763
00:41:41,889 --> 00:41:45,256
Not a little bed and breakfast
in Nova Scotia."

764
00:41:45,326 --> 00:41:48,056
- Maybe you don't agree.
- I think Paris is beautiful.

765
00:41:48,128 --> 00:41:51,291
- Yes!
- I don't know the other place.

766
00:41:51,365 --> 00:41:53,731
I think the kids want to rough it:

767
00:41:53,801 --> 00:41:55,928
- Sleeping bags, bikes.
- [Chuckle]

768
00:41:56,003 --> 00:41:57,994
They'll come home covered with ticks.

769
00:41:58,072 --> 00:42:02,338
My dog spends half the time
at the vet from roughing it.

770
00:42:02,409 --> 00:42:05,970
If you talked to them,
they'd listen to you.

771
00:42:06,046 --> 00:42:08,139
They know how sensible you are.

772
00:42:08,215 --> 00:42:11,275
I think they're trying
to stay within a budget.

773
00:42:11,352 --> 00:42:13,445
Aren't we lucky to have
children with values?

774
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,420
Henry and I'll pay for it.

775
00:42:15,489 --> 00:42:19,585
I know the exact room
on Lake Como they should have.

776
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,890
Oh, God!
Wouldn't it be funny...

777
00:42:21,962 --> 00:42:25,159
if we showed up for dinner
at the next table?

778
00:42:25,232 --> 00:42:27,427
What a hoot!

779
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:30,493
Listen, Henry and I...

780
00:42:30,571 --> 00:42:33,369
want to contribute the cake.

781
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,103
These people make an 18-layer...

782
00:42:37,177 --> 00:42:40,476
lemon and cream thing
that is to die for.

783
00:42:40,547 --> 00:42:43,482
It's so subtle
you can't even taste it.

784
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:47,384
<i>This will not taste like it came</i>
<i>from the corner bakery.</i>

785
00:42:48,989 --> 00:42:52,686
Who the hell wants
a cake you can't taste?

786
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,093
Better turn my piece in.
I thought I tasted that.

787
00:42:56,163 --> 00:42:58,222
They're gonna
take over the wedding...

788
00:42:58,298 --> 00:43:00,732
and take the guts out of it.

789
00:43:00,801 --> 00:43:02,928
They just want to help.
What's wrong?

790
00:43:03,003 --> 00:43:06,370
How are they gonna do something
from Jake's ethnic background?

791
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,273
They think <i>maybe</i> they're Scottish.

792
00:43:09,343 --> 00:43:11,709
The family has no texture.
They don't want any.

793
00:43:11,779 --> 00:43:14,475
They just want to be <i>correct!</i>

794
00:43:14,548 --> 00:43:17,813
We're gonna have correct,
invisible grandchildren.

795
00:43:17,885 --> 00:43:19,819
No talking, running, screaming.

796
00:43:19,887 --> 00:43:22,879
We won't know they visited
until they write a thank you note.

797
00:43:22,956 --> 00:43:27,052
- Jake's not like that.
- He's trying to break out.

798
00:43:27,127 --> 00:43:30,858
He thinks if he marries Betsy,
he'll become <i>visible.</i>

799
00:43:30,931 --> 00:43:34,128
What if she disappears?

800
00:43:34,201 --> 00:43:37,364
It's a wedding,
not the "Land of the Living Dead."

801
00:43:37,438 --> 00:43:40,532
- % % [Radio]
- You're too affected by this.

802
00:43:40,607 --> 00:43:43,235
Relax. Enjoy yourself.

803
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:46,643
- I am admitting to what I feel.
- And I'm not?

804
00:43:46,713 --> 00:43:49,511
You're always telling me
how I'm feeling.

805
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:52,552
I don't understand
how your mind works.

806
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:56,055
You have this incredible
imagination, dreams.

807
00:43:56,123 --> 00:43:59,183
Sometimes you don't know
what you're going through.

808
00:43:59,259 --> 00:44:02,057
You're treating this
like one of your projects,

809
00:44:02,129 --> 00:44:05,326
a bunch of stuff
you're gonna organize,

810
00:44:05,399 --> 00:44:07,959
juggle around and pull together
at the last minute.

811
00:44:08,035 --> 00:44:10,902
Your daughter is leaving,
and you're not dealing with it.

812
00:44:10,971 --> 00:44:12,962
Let's deal with it.

813
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,133
We'll call up Missing Persons...

814
00:44:15,209 --> 00:44:17,439
and put her face on a milk carton.

815
00:44:17,511 --> 00:44:20,105
Well, I'm laughing at that!
Hear that?

816
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,944
<i>[Betsy]</i>
<i>He's so into everything all posed.</i>

817
00:44:23,016 --> 00:44:26,144
I don't know why we can't
have candid pictures.

818
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,381
What's this Dad has about video?

819
00:44:28,455 --> 00:44:31,015
I don't want to get married
with cameras in my face.

820
00:44:31,091 --> 00:44:35,653
- He wants to remember it.
- Can't he pay close attention?

821
00:44:35,729 --> 00:44:37,663
When you were 11,

822
00:44:37,731 --> 00:44:41,724
you wouldn't eat lettuce
out of solidarity with farm workers.

823
00:44:41,802 --> 00:44:45,329
These rich people are gonna
give you crystal salad bowls.

824
00:44:45,405 --> 00:44:47,896
It's not like I'm buying
their philosophy.

825
00:44:47,975 --> 00:44:51,342
I'm just registering for gifts
to make Jake's parents happy.

826
00:44:51,411 --> 00:44:54,039
You know what would
make his parents happy?

827
00:44:54,114 --> 00:44:57,777
If she bought a steel mill
and busted a union.

828
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,713
Watching me register at Tiffany's...

829
00:45:01,788 --> 00:45:04,188
nearly sent my mom to the hospital.

830
00:45:04,258 --> 00:45:06,556
What difference does it make
where the gifts come from?

831
00:45:06,627 --> 00:45:08,322
It's the symbolism.

832
00:45:08,395 --> 00:45:12,593
Mom went to Selma,
the Chicago Convention in '68.

833
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:14,529
She ran the peace movement
in our little town.

834
00:45:14,601 --> 00:45:16,435
That was her life.

835
00:45:16,503 --> 00:45:19,904
Your parents are awfully
involved with their children.

836
00:45:19,973 --> 00:45:21,440
What?

837
00:45:21,508 --> 00:45:24,238
Forget it.
This is getting me nuts.

838
00:45:24,311 --> 00:45:28,111
It's the wedding that ate New York!

839
00:45:28,181 --> 00:45:31,514
Endless drafts on the seating.
Serve peanuts or cashews?

840
00:45:31,585 --> 00:45:34,076
<i>Everything's a summit meeting</i>
<i>with your parents.</i>

841
00:45:34,154 --> 00:45:36,884
- They are paying for it.
- They didn't have to.

842
00:45:36,957 --> 00:45:38,288
This could've been so easy.

843
00:45:38,358 --> 00:45:40,553
Your parents are accustomed
to giving orders,

844
00:45:40,627 --> 00:45:43,755
but that doesn't mean
it's easy to follow them.

845
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:46,993
You know what you get from
your mother that I really hate?

846
00:45:47,067 --> 00:45:49,433
All this class warfare stuff.

847
00:45:49,503 --> 00:45:52,404
My mother's not thinking
of coming on our honeymoon!

848
00:45:52,472 --> 00:45:55,407
We better get off this.
How 'bout a movie?

849
00:45:55,475 --> 00:45:58,467
<i>My parents aren't trying</i>
<i>to move us into an apartment...</i>

850
00:45:58,545 --> 00:46:01,378
that's so rich I'd be
embarrassed to invite friends.

851
00:46:01,448 --> 00:46:03,541
Do you have to be so "sixties"?

852
00:46:03,617 --> 00:46:07,644
- I can't help my family has money.
- I can't help if mine has values.

853
00:46:07,721 --> 00:46:10,155
Like your father trying
to impress with a wedding...

854
00:46:10,223 --> 00:46:14,489
- he can't even afford?
- My father has a big Italian family.

855
00:46:14,561 --> 00:46:16,961
We have two dozen relatives
we couldn't invite...

856
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:19,760
so yours could invite
business associates.

857
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:23,428
- That's values?
- If yours is so goddamned superior,

858
00:46:23,503 --> 00:46:26,336
I can't understand why
you'd want to break up the act.

859
00:46:26,406 --> 00:46:30,035
- Maybe I won't.
- I'm gonna go see a movie.

860
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:33,307
Try making it a double feature!

861
00:46:35,389 --> 00:46:38,358
Jitters.
This is what we went through.

862
00:46:38,425 --> 00:46:41,417
People get crazy
when they get married.

863
00:46:41,495 --> 00:46:44,055
I'm really thinking
of calling it off.

864
00:46:44,131 --> 00:46:47,123
- You'll get over this.
- How do you know?

865
00:46:47,201 --> 00:46:49,499
I already paid for
the wine, tent, caterer.

866
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:52,232
We're talking about our daughter.

867
00:46:52,306 --> 00:46:56,299
We're gonna lose money,
and she'll marry him anyway.

868
00:46:56,376 --> 00:46:58,867
She loves him.
She doesn't want to break up.

869
00:46:58,946 --> 00:47:02,245
She's been under tremendous
pressure from those people.

870
00:47:02,316 --> 00:47:04,944
They're like a noose around her neck.

871
00:47:05,018 --> 00:47:08,419
- Don't talk about them like that.
- Not Jake. I love Jake.

872
00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:11,117
So do I,
and don't talk about his family.

873
00:47:11,191 --> 00:47:13,489
Betsy, call him up.

874
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,256
Make a date for coffee
and talk it over.

875
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:17,490
No. Forget it.

876
00:47:17,564 --> 00:47:19,964
- Didn't she say she loves him?
- Yes.

877
00:47:20,033 --> 00:47:23,025
- Why won't she marry him?
- You're getting crazy.

878
00:47:23,103 --> 00:47:25,094
I went into hock and into business...

879
00:47:25,172 --> 00:47:27,470
with your sleazy brother-in-law...

880
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:30,237
and that orangutan
he has for a partner.

881
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,301
She loves him. That's it.

882
00:47:32,379 --> 00:47:35,177
No more indecision.
She marries him!

883
00:47:35,249 --> 00:47:39,185
What about if the two of you
talked it over with a friend?

884
00:47:39,253 --> 00:47:42,416
- Maybe you'd see it differently.
- We did talk.

885
00:47:42,489 --> 00:47:44,650
That's how I decided to move out.

886
00:47:44,725 --> 00:47:46,784
The wedding lasts for one day,

887
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,454
but we're the ones
that have to live together!

888
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:51,464
I don't want to push you,

889
00:47:51,532 --> 00:47:54,467
but I don't think you
really want to break up.

890
00:47:54,535 --> 00:47:58,562
I've never seen you
so happy as you are with him.

891
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:01,301
Talk it over.
Try to be reasonable.

892
00:48:01,375 --> 00:48:04,435
I'm doing my best!
What do you want?

893
00:48:04,511 --> 00:48:09,073
I want you to be reasonable,
for God's sake!

894
00:48:09,149 --> 00:48:11,310
I'm gonna go to Connie's.

895
00:48:11,385 --> 00:48:13,478
Oh, come on.
What are you...

896
00:48:13,554 --> 00:48:16,284
What are you going to Connie's for?

897
00:48:17,624 --> 00:48:19,785
Let her go.

898
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:22,727
She knows she's gonna marry him.

899
00:48:22,796 --> 00:48:27,130
She's just putting me
through this for nothing.

900
00:48:27,201 --> 00:48:29,669
How can you be so calm like that?

901
00:48:29,736 --> 00:48:32,830
'Cause I have that headache
I get just before I throw up.

902
00:48:45,085 --> 00:48:47,713
I don't have a lot of time.

903
00:48:47,788 --> 00:48:49,050
I have a class.

904
00:48:49,122 --> 00:48:51,920
I'll walk with you.
You all right?

905
00:48:51,992 --> 00:48:55,155
Jake and I talked and worked it out.

906
00:48:55,229 --> 00:48:57,356
You were right.
Let's forget about it.

907
00:48:57,431 --> 00:49:00,423
I love you.
I don't want you to be mad at me.

908
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:04,129
I'm not.
It's just we're under this pressure.

909
00:49:04,204 --> 00:49:06,434
You guys really got to lighten up.

910
00:49:06,506 --> 00:49:09,100
We can do that.

911
00:49:09,176 --> 00:49:11,804
I just want you to be happy.

912
00:49:11,878 --> 00:49:15,336
If you don't want to use
my cousin's band, forget it.

913
00:49:15,415 --> 00:49:17,280
If you don't want
a religious ceremony,

914
00:49:17,351 --> 00:49:18,943
Mom knows a judge.

915
00:49:19,019 --> 00:49:22,352
Only a few more weeks.
You oughta be enjoying this.

916
00:49:22,422 --> 00:49:24,856
- You got to lighten up, too.
- I know.

917
00:49:24,925 --> 00:49:27,917
Come to the house for dinner,
have a few laughs.

918
00:49:27,995 --> 00:49:30,964
- Forget about the wedding.
- Great.

919
00:49:31,031 --> 00:49:32,931
You sure you don't want
my cousin's band?

920
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,763
- Dad!
- I'm kidding!

921
00:49:34,835 --> 00:49:38,032
<i>[Eddie] Everybody's a little</i>
<i>strange in this family.</i>

922
00:49:38,105 --> 00:49:40,539
Did she ever do
her ape thing for you?

923
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:42,165
- You do an ape thing?
- No.

924
00:49:42,242 --> 00:49:44,608
- Do the ape thing.
- What ape thing?

925
00:49:44,678 --> 00:49:47,203
He's got to know
what he's getting into.

926
00:49:47,281 --> 00:49:48,339
I don't think so.

927
00:49:48,415 --> 00:49:50,280
- Come on.
- Okay.

928
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:53,217
Watch this.

929
00:49:53,287 --> 00:49:55,847
[Ape Sounds]

930
00:49:55,922 --> 00:49:59,187
- That was beautiful.
- We're very proud of her.

931
00:49:59,259 --> 00:50:02,956
<i>% % Gee I really love you</i>
and we're% %

932
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:06,466
<i>% % Gonna get married% %</i>

933
00:50:06,533 --> 00:50:10,970

935
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:19,579
<i>% % Goin'to the chapel of love% % % %</i>

936
00:50:19,646 --> 00:50:21,580
I'm hip.
You want me to say...

937
00:50:21,648 --> 00:50:23,946
"husband and wife"
instead of "man and wife."

938
00:50:24,017 --> 00:50:27,077
And leave "obey" out of
"love, honor, and obey."

939
00:50:27,154 --> 00:50:28,086
Right.

940
00:50:28,155 --> 00:50:31,056
We'd like you to leave out "God" too.

941
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:34,320
Will that be a problem?

942
00:50:34,394 --> 00:50:36,885
Why? It's nice
for your Grandpa Morris.

943
00:50:36,963 --> 00:50:41,161
We just don't want anything
religious in the service.

944
00:50:41,234 --> 00:50:43,395
It means a lot to us.

945
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:47,133
What about stepping on the glass?

946
00:50:47,207 --> 00:50:49,402
What does that represent, exactly?

947
00:50:49,476 --> 00:50:50,966
Different things.

948
00:50:51,044 --> 00:50:53,604
Mainly it's supposed to signify...

949
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,342
the destruction of the Temple.

950
00:50:56,416 --> 00:50:59,510
That sounds pretty religious.

951
00:50:59,586 --> 00:51:03,215
Some people say it represents
the breaking of the hymen.

952
00:51:04,925 --> 00:51:07,155
I don't think so.

953
00:51:07,227 --> 00:51:10,060
I think I got one you'll like:

954
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,860
Breaking with the past
and moving on to the future.

955
00:51:12,933 --> 00:51:15,265
You no longer belong
to your parents' house.

956
00:51:15,335 --> 00:51:18,304
- That's good.
- I like that.

957
00:51:18,372 --> 00:51:21,603
Good! We'll say
it's breaking with the past.

958
00:51:21,675 --> 00:51:24,303
Grandpa Morris will know
it's the destruction of the Temple.

959
00:51:27,047 --> 00:51:29,743
Betsy, if I knew it was leaking,

960
00:51:29,816 --> 00:51:32,250
I'd have fixed it myself.

961
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,617
Someone will be there in the morning.

962
00:51:34,688 --> 00:51:36,519
Good-bye, darling.

963
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:40,617
I'm so sorry I let those kids
into my building.

964
00:51:40,694 --> 00:51:44,186
- They're obsessed with plumbing.
- They had me over for tea.

965
00:51:44,264 --> 00:51:46,926
Keep away from them.

966
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,265
They invited me to their wedding.
Sounds wonderful.

967
00:51:50,337 --> 00:51:53,636
Oh, it'll be fantastic!
Sit next to my wife.

968
00:51:53,707 --> 00:51:57,541
The two of you can talk about
how I leave you both alone.

969
00:51:57,611 --> 00:52:01,138
You can't be in the same room
with my wife!

970
00:52:01,214 --> 00:52:03,375
I already was.

971
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:04,940
- When?
- At your slumlord trial.

972
00:52:05,018 --> 00:52:08,545
Don't call it a "slumlord" trial.

973
00:52:08,622 --> 00:52:12,752
Oscar, I am going to the wedding.

974
00:52:12,954 --> 00:52:16,287
[Eddie] Put my mother and sister
with the Clarks,

975
00:52:16,358 --> 00:52:19,657
but they'll be with your cousins.

976
00:52:19,728 --> 00:52:20,456
Is that okay?

977
00:52:20,529 --> 00:52:22,759
Whatever is good
for you is good for us.

978
00:52:22,831 --> 00:52:25,857
Your sister doesn't
talk to the Clarks.

979
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:29,734
- Put the Clarks with the Cohens.
- They owe the Cohens money.

980
00:52:29,805 --> 00:52:32,865
And not with Oscar.
He sued them once.

981
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:36,399
Do they play an instrument?
They can sit with the band.

982
00:52:36,478 --> 00:52:38,969
Look.
Our cousins are in the way.

983
00:52:39,047 --> 00:52:41,277
We can put them anywhere.

984
00:52:41,349 --> 00:52:43,909
- <i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
- <i>Our side's the problem.</i>

985
00:52:43,985 --> 00:52:44,917
<i>I'll get it.</i>

986
00:52:44,986 --> 00:52:47,454
Maybe put them
with one of my cousins.

987
00:52:47,522 --> 00:52:49,319
Hello?

988
00:52:49,391 --> 00:52:51,825
Yes. One second.
Connie?

989
00:52:51,893 --> 00:52:53,417
Telephone.

990
00:52:53,495 --> 00:52:56,362
Who's calling, please?

991
00:52:57,733 --> 00:53:00,759
- Who is it?
- Stevie Dee.

992
00:53:00,836 --> 00:53:04,294
Oh, yeah?
Hello?

993
00:53:05,006 --> 00:53:06,940
Yeah.

994
00:53:08,176 --> 00:53:10,167
No.

995
00:53:10,245 --> 00:53:12,270
I don't think so.

996
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:16,809
I'll talk to you...

997
00:53:16,885 --> 00:53:19,285
another time. Bye.

998
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,950
You just got a call from Stevie Dee.

999
00:53:23,024 --> 00:53:24,958
I know. I just took it.

1000
00:53:25,026 --> 00:53:28,086
I mean, how do you know him?

1001
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:31,132
- From the site.
- Oh, the site.

1002
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:33,292
- You know.
- Yeah.

1003
00:53:33,368 --> 00:53:36,360
- And the city.
- And the city. Ah.

1004
00:53:36,438 --> 00:53:40,306
Where did you put me?
Put me with Grandma.

1005
00:53:52,821 --> 00:53:57,053
- Stevie Dee, mind if I join you?
- It would be an honor.

1006
00:53:57,125 --> 00:54:00,754
Those plumbers are gonna
finally get work done.

1007
00:54:00,829 --> 00:54:03,093
I'll be glad to get
those guys out of here.

1008
00:54:03,165 --> 00:54:06,692
They have been remiss
on the slowness on this job.

1009
00:54:06,768 --> 00:54:09,703
I've already told that
to Mr. Henner.

1010
00:54:11,239 --> 00:54:14,037
That's quite a lunch.

1011
00:54:14,109 --> 00:54:16,304
- I like to eat good things.
- It's nice.

1012
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:19,814
- You like artichoke?
- No, I got a lot.

1013
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:23,874
I believe that sandwiches
are generally too big.

1014
00:54:23,952 --> 00:54:26,147
Take the meatball sandwich.

1015
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,485
Meatballs don't go between bread!

1016
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:30,752
The food falls out of your mouth.

1017
00:54:30,826 --> 00:54:33,954
It's not dignified.

1018
00:54:34,029 --> 00:54:36,793
Congratulations
on your daughter's wedding.

1019
00:54:36,865 --> 00:54:40,028
Are you happy with
the young man she is marrying?

1020
00:54:40,101 --> 00:54:42,365
- Yeah. He's a nice kid.
- Wonderful.

1021
00:54:42,437 --> 00:54:44,837
When parents don't approve
of a prospective son-in-law,

1022
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:47,067
it is not good.

1023
00:54:47,142 --> 00:54:50,077
I would never put myself
in a position like that.

1024
00:54:50,145 --> 00:54:53,308
- Yeah?
- If I loved a young lady,

1025
00:54:53,381 --> 00:54:56,714
I'd make sure her father liked me.

1026
00:54:56,785 --> 00:54:59,083
I would not give up until he did,

1027
00:54:59,154 --> 00:55:01,452
even if it took the rest of my life.

1028
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,364
Salut'.

1029
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,933
So long. See ya.

1030
00:55:19,908 --> 00:55:22,001
- Bye.
- Bye.

1031
00:55:23,745 --> 00:55:25,679
I don't mean to intrude.

1032
00:55:25,747 --> 00:55:28,341
Please don't be offended
by my presence.

1033
00:55:28,416 --> 00:55:32,284
You want to talk to me
about something?

1034
00:55:32,354 --> 00:55:34,481
I thought you might
be interested in dinner.

1035
00:55:34,556 --> 00:55:38,720
Anyplace you like.
I have a reservation at Caravelle,

1036
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,762
also at Le Cirque and Lutece.

1037
00:55:42,898 --> 00:55:47,198
I'm not dressed.
Those are fancy places.

1038
00:55:47,269 --> 00:55:50,238
We could stop by your apartment.
You could change.

1039
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:53,001
I would wait in the car.

1040
00:55:53,074 --> 00:55:55,201
Stevie,

1041
00:55:55,277 --> 00:55:57,939
I don't know what to say.

1042
00:55:58,013 --> 00:56:00,106
You're a very nice guy.

1043
00:56:00,181 --> 00:56:02,672
Do not think that
I am pressuring you.

1044
00:56:02,751 --> 00:56:04,685
I would be profoundly saddened...

1045
00:56:04,753 --> 00:56:07,916
if I or anybody caused you
a moment of unhappiness.

1046
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:12,323
I don't want you to spend a lot
of money on some fancy place...

1047
00:56:12,394 --> 00:56:15,557
where we probably wouldn't
know what we were eating.

1048
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:17,825
Perhaps you'd like
a good Italian dinner.

1049
00:56:17,899 --> 00:56:20,993
I can take you
to the best place in town.

1050
00:56:21,069 --> 00:56:23,367
I do have to eat dinner.

1051
00:56:23,438 --> 00:56:26,464
Please...
it would be my honor.

1057

So, what would you like?

1058
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:12,619
I'm extremely interested to know
what you enjoy eating.

1059
00:57:12,687 --> 00:57:14,279
You are?

1060
00:57:14,356 --> 00:57:16,722
I think about you all the time.

1061
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:19,191
I hope that doesn't offend you.

1062
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:23,060
I listen to the radio, and I think...

1063
00:57:23,131 --> 00:57:25,565
what kind of music does she like?

1064
00:57:25,633 --> 00:57:28,727
Hard Rock?
Easy Listening?

1065
00:57:28,803 --> 00:57:32,330
Maybe classical music, like Sinatra?

1066
00:57:33,842 --> 00:57:38,074
Last night, I was looking
at my plate during dinner.

1067
00:57:38,146 --> 00:57:40,774
I thought to myself,

1068
00:57:40,849 --> 00:57:44,182
does she like veal and peppers
with olive oil,

1069
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,482
or does she like it with gravy?

1070
00:57:46,554 --> 00:57:49,990
These are the things
that go through my head.

1071
00:57:50,058 --> 00:57:53,084
What would you like?
They'll make anything.

1072
00:57:55,463 --> 00:57:59,627
I'd just like a little salad...

1073
00:57:59,701 --> 00:58:02,226
and some pasta with tomato and basil.

1074
00:58:02,303 --> 00:58:04,362
Tomato and basil?

1075
00:58:05,673 --> 00:58:08,369
Tomato and basil.
That's beautiful.

1076
00:58:16,988 --> 00:58:19,183
Good night.

1077
00:58:20,092 --> 00:58:22,287
Good night.

1078
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,590
I hope it won't
bother you if I say...

1079
00:58:24,663 --> 00:58:28,622
that this was the most
enjoyable evening of my life.

1080
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,191
Thank you, Stevie.

1081
00:58:31,269 --> 00:58:34,261
I enjoyed it, too, very much.

1082
00:58:35,874 --> 00:58:38,604
I've been working
very closely with your father...

1083
00:58:38,677 --> 00:58:40,736
for some time now.

1084
00:58:40,812 --> 00:58:43,838
I have the highest respect
for your father.

1085
00:58:43,915 --> 00:58:45,883
Thank you.

1086
00:58:45,951 --> 00:58:48,181
You think he would be offended...

1087
00:58:48,253 --> 00:58:51,814
if I requested your permission
for a kiss good night?

1088
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:54,791
I don't really discuss that with him.

1089
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:58,125
I think you have to
apply to me personally.

1090
00:58:58,196 --> 00:59:00,790
- Would that be...?
- It would be fine.

1091
00:59:24,389 --> 00:59:27,688
Do you want to come in
for a cup of something?

1092
00:59:27,759 --> 00:59:31,024
I don't think that would be
the right thing to do.

1093
00:59:31,096 --> 00:59:34,657
I hold you in very
high esteem, Connie.

1094
00:59:34,733 --> 00:59:37,167
The highest.

1095
00:59:38,603 --> 00:59:42,061
Whatever you need of me...
anything...

1096
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:44,700
please call.

1097
00:59:55,314 --> 00:59:58,408
<i>% % % % [Radio]</i>

1098
01:00:08,527 --> 01:00:11,553
- What are you doing?
- I'm on a break.

1099
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:14,656
An hour ago, you were
reading that same magazine.

1100
01:00:14,733 --> 01:00:18,999
I was also on a break
at that time, too.

1101
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:21,062
I see.

1102
01:00:30,749 --> 01:00:33,741
- What the hell is going on here?
- What?

1103
01:00:33,819 --> 01:00:35,787
Georgie's guys get $2,000 a week...

1104
01:00:35,855 --> 01:00:37,880
for reading comic books.

1105
01:00:37,957 --> 01:00:39,720
I'm meeting with Georgie.

1106
01:00:39,792 --> 01:00:42,625
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

1107
01:00:42,695 --> 01:00:43,923
Why not?

1108
01:00:43,996 --> 01:00:45,987
He cuts people up
into little meatballs.

1109
01:00:46,065 --> 01:00:47,999
I want some answers.

1110
01:00:48,067 --> 01:00:52,436
Being dead is very boring.
I don't think you'd like it.

1111
01:00:52,505 --> 01:00:54,939
Oscar, this is just a question.

1112
01:00:55,007 --> 01:00:58,135
I'm being told to hire
workers who don't work.

1113
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:00,440
I don't understand that.

1114
01:01:00,513 --> 01:01:03,243
There are different ways of working.

1115
01:01:03,315 --> 01:01:05,943
I got a consultant at $5,000 a week.

1116
01:01:06,018 --> 01:01:08,111
He doesn't even come to the site.

1117
01:01:08,187 --> 01:01:10,553
What kind of a consultant is that?

1118
01:01:10,623 --> 01:01:13,057
- This is just a question.
- A question.

1119
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:16,026
He's probably sending in reports...
faxes, modems...

1120
01:01:16,095 --> 01:01:19,030
This project is taking forever,
and it's gonna cost a fortune.

1121
01:01:19,098 --> 01:01:21,794
Don't they care about that?

1122
01:01:21,867 --> 01:01:25,462
How do we know this isn't some
kind of money-laundering thing?

1123
01:01:25,538 --> 01:01:27,631
What? Come on!

1124
01:01:27,706 --> 01:01:30,869
Uncle Georgie has me paying
huge sums of money to these guys.

1125
01:01:30,943 --> 01:01:33,241
That money could be
going back to him.

1126
01:01:33,312 --> 01:01:35,746
Why would he need you to pay himself?

1127
01:01:35,814 --> 01:01:39,682
Somebody may have to go to jail,
and it ain't gonna be me.

1128
01:01:39,752 --> 01:01:43,051
He's a businessman.
You have to get to know him.

1129
01:01:43,122 --> 01:01:45,886
He's a warm, wonderful person.

1130
01:01:45,958 --> 01:01:48,449
Tell him I want
to have dinner with him.

1131
01:01:48,527 --> 01:01:50,961
I've got a few questions to ask him.

1132
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:55,558
- Oscar tells me you're Italian.
- That's right.

1133
01:01:55,634 --> 01:01:58,228
What kind of name is hopper?

1134
01:01:58,304 --> 01:02:00,499
My father changed it.

1135
01:02:00,573 --> 01:02:03,906
- It used to be Scanatanuzzo.
- Scanna-what?

1136
01:02:03,976 --> 01:02:07,810
That was the problem.
He was a salesman.

1137
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,745
In those days,

1138
01:02:09,815 --> 01:02:13,046
you had to have a name
people could remember.

1139
01:02:13,118 --> 01:02:15,552
If he was in my organization...

1140
01:02:15,621 --> 01:02:18,920
I would just call him
"Stan the Scan."

1141
01:02:18,991 --> 01:02:21,186
Hopper's nice, too.

1142
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:24,525
What's in a name?
Hey, who said that?

1143
01:02:24,597 --> 01:02:27,464
Nicky the Greek used to say that.

1144
01:02:27,533 --> 01:02:30,559
No, before him, that dead guy.

1145
01:02:30,636 --> 01:02:34,037
- That guy that got hit last week?
- Deader than him.

1146
01:02:34,106 --> 01:02:36,904
I don't know nobody deader than that.

1147
01:02:36,976 --> 01:02:39,376
A couple of real geniuses.

1148
01:02:39,445 --> 01:02:41,879
Shakespeare said it, you pineapples!

1149
01:02:41,947 --> 01:02:44,916
How come you're not
drinking any wine?

1150
01:02:44,984 --> 01:02:47,009
Thank you.

1151
01:02:47,086 --> 01:02:49,316
I used to give Stevie Dee
a little sip...

1152
01:02:49,388 --> 01:02:51,652
when he was six years old,

1153
01:02:51,724 --> 01:02:54,818
- didn't I?
- A little sip, that's right.

1154
01:02:54,893 --> 01:02:57,384
But you gotta teach
kids responsibility.

1155
01:02:57,463 --> 01:02:59,897
I'd tell him, "I catch you loaded,

1156
01:02:59,965 --> 01:03:03,924
- I bust your fuckin' hands."
- He was a good uncle.

1157
01:03:05,004 --> 01:03:07,097
<i>I hear from Oscar...</i>

1158
01:03:07,172 --> 01:03:10,437
that you're not happy
with our arrangement.

1159
01:03:10,509 --> 01:03:12,602
I have a few questions,

1160
01:03:12,678 --> 01:03:15,613
- but I wouldn't say I'm not happy.
- <i>Good.</i>

1161
01:03:15,681 --> 01:03:18,616
This is my philosophy
of business management.

1162
01:03:18,684 --> 01:03:20,845
When everybody's happy,

1163
01:03:20,919 --> 01:03:24,047
then it's very unusual
that anybody would be unhappy.

1164
01:03:24,123 --> 01:03:27,354
<i>But you can't be happy</i>
<i>with unhappy people...</i>

1165
01:03:27,426 --> 01:03:28,950
<i>contributing miserableness.</i>

1166
01:03:29,028 --> 01:03:31,326
Happy people could make
unhappy people happy...

1167
01:03:31,397 --> 01:03:32,921
by not making others miserable.

1168
01:03:32,998 --> 01:03:36,161
- Pay attention. This is wisdom.
- <i>This brings on...</i>

1169
01:03:36,235 --> 01:03:38,226
misery and depression,

1170
01:03:38,303 --> 01:03:40,737
whereby people start
jumping out of windows...

1171
01:03:40,806 --> 01:03:43,206
and leaping in front of trains.

1172
01:03:44,443 --> 01:03:47,640
So which is it?
Are you happy or unhappy?

1173
01:03:47,713 --> 01:03:51,444
I'm happy.

1174
01:03:51,517 --> 01:03:53,417
The guy behind you in the black suit.

1175
01:03:53,485 --> 01:03:56,386
<i>I have a feeling</i>
<i>he is not their accountant.</i>

1176
01:03:56,455 --> 01:03:58,753
<i>[Eddie] Would you excuse me?</i>

1177
01:03:58,824 --> 01:04:01,088
I have to go to the bathroom.

1178
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:03,424
Nature calls, right?

1179
01:04:08,367 --> 01:04:10,335
I gotta go, too.

1180
01:04:10,402 --> 01:04:13,838
What'd they do,
put something in the food?

1181
01:04:13,906 --> 01:04:16,773
I hear you're hanging
around a station house,

1182
01:04:16,842 --> 01:04:19,276
trying to make time with a cop.

1183
01:04:19,344 --> 01:04:21,312
Give me the check.

1184
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:24,838
- She's a very fine young lady.
- Yeah?

1185
01:04:24,917 --> 01:04:27,943
I'm gonna give you
a little advice about life.

1186
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:31,080
You follow this, you won't be sorry.

1187
01:04:31,156 --> 01:04:35,525
Don't screw with your brains
and don't think with your dick.

1188
01:04:35,594 --> 01:04:37,755
That's from the heart.

1189
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:40,321
What are you doing?

1190
01:04:41,333 --> 01:04:44,029
<i>Hey, get down from there!</i>

1191
01:04:44,103 --> 01:04:46,537
There's too many people
smoking in there.

1192
01:04:46,605 --> 01:04:49,938
- I got to get a little air.
- You're being ridiculous.

1193
01:04:50,008 --> 01:04:52,203
I have a respiration problem.

1194
01:04:52,277 --> 01:04:54,973
If they choke me,
I won't be able to breathe.

1195
01:04:55,047 --> 01:04:57,208
What are we doing
in business with them?

1196
01:04:57,282 --> 01:05:00,342
They have a right to invest,
the same as everyone else.

1197
01:05:00,419 --> 01:05:03,752
- They're criminals!
- You're my wife's sister's husband.

1198
01:05:03,822 --> 01:05:06,950
Would I let you get mixed up
with people like that?

1199
01:05:07,025 --> 01:05:08,993
They're ordinary guys.

1200
01:05:09,061 --> 01:05:11,825
"Ordinary guys"?
I can't believe this.

1201
01:05:11,897 --> 01:05:14,832
Give them a chance,
but watch what you say.

1202
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:16,993
They're a little sensitive.

1203
01:05:17,069 --> 01:05:19,069
How did they get to be sensitive
and I'm a pussy?

1204
01:05:19,137 --> 01:05:21,369
This is a real mystery.

1205
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,874
<i>Let's stop off...</i>

1206
01:05:23,942 --> 01:05:26,877
<i>and get some ice cream</i>
<i>at La Colombina's.</i>

1207
01:05:26,945 --> 01:05:29,539
Ice cream!
What a great idea!

1208
01:05:29,615 --> 01:05:32,413
You can get it just like in Florence.

1209
01:05:32,484 --> 01:05:35,078
Hey, we're gonna go to La Colombina.

1210
01:05:35,154 --> 01:05:37,520
They got everything there.

1211
01:05:37,589 --> 01:05:40,353
They got melon ice cream,
sambuca ice cream.

1212
01:05:40,425 --> 01:05:43,189
Sambuca ice cream.
How about that?

1213
01:05:43,262 --> 01:05:46,595
My wife always says, "how come
you eat the strange ones?

1214
01:05:46,665 --> 01:05:49,065
"You never eat vanilla.

1215
01:05:49,134 --> 01:05:52,365
Always persimmon and walnut,
or fig and mangoes."

1216
01:05:52,437 --> 01:05:54,871
I say,
"I like variety."

1217
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:57,875
She says, "You haven't
had vanilla in 20 years.

1218
01:05:57,943 --> 01:06:00,878
What kind of variety is that?"

1219
01:06:00,946 --> 01:06:02,675
That's a very...

1220
01:06:05,617 --> 01:06:08,415
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

1221
01:06:08,487 --> 01:06:10,148
<i>Get in!</i>

1222
01:06:10,222 --> 01:06:13,419
They're gonna kill us,
the sons of bitches!

1223
01:06:16,562 --> 01:06:20,054
- Get in the car!
- I don't want any ice cream.

1224
01:06:21,066 --> 01:06:23,830
- <i>Get in the car!</i>
- Oh, my God.

1225
01:06:23,902 --> 01:06:26,427
Who are they?
Who are they?

1226
01:06:26,505 --> 01:06:29,497
- They're following us.
- They're following us.

1227
01:06:29,575 --> 01:06:32,100
- Don't be nervous.
- I'm not nervous.

1228
01:06:32,177 --> 01:06:34,577
<i>Anselmo!</i>

1229
01:06:34,646 --> 01:06:37,308
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>No, no!</i>

1230
01:06:37,382 --> 01:06:39,976
- Don't do that!
- Get on the floor!

1231
01:06:41,086 --> 01:06:43,919
You're gonna get glass all over us!

1232
01:06:43,989 --> 01:06:45,616
Up your ass.

1233
01:06:56,635 --> 01:06:58,830
Everybody, get in a cab.

1234
01:06:58,904 --> 01:07:00,872
Lay on the floor.

1235
01:07:00,939 --> 01:07:03,874
Mickey!
We need four cabs.

1236
01:07:03,942 --> 01:07:07,036
Change that to eight cabs.
Four empty ones.

1237
01:07:07,112 --> 01:07:09,512
That way, anybody follows us,

1238
01:07:09,581 --> 01:07:12,880
it's 6-2 they get the wrong cab.

1239
01:07:12,951 --> 01:07:15,977
My Uncle Georgie can figure
the odds like an adding machine.

1240
01:07:16,054 --> 01:07:18,318
Gentlemen, get in the car.

1241
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:20,722
- On the floor!
- Get in the cab!

1242
01:07:20,792 --> 01:07:23,158
- Get on the floor.
- Thank you.

1243
01:07:33,739 --> 01:07:37,334
- Our deal is great. Don't be nervous.
- I'm not nervous.

1244
01:07:37,409 --> 01:07:39,468
You talk a lot when you're nervous.

1245
01:07:39,544 --> 01:07:42,069
I was nervous before,
but I'm all right now.

1246
01:07:42,147 --> 01:07:46,083
[Oscar] We go from this to shopping
centers with multiplex theaters.

1247
01:07:53,992 --> 01:07:57,553
<i>[Father] You know what the most</i>
<i>important day of my life was?</i>

1248
01:07:57,629 --> 01:08:00,530
In 1951 we got a TV set.

1249
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:03,591
In one day I saw
DiMaggio, Durante, Toscanini...

1250
01:08:03,669 --> 01:08:06,365
All in the same day.
I said to myself,

1251
01:08:06,438 --> 01:08:08,872
"Let somebody call me
a guinea now."

1252
01:08:08,941 --> 01:08:11,603
<i>You know why I changed my name?</i>

1253
01:08:11,677 --> 01:08:14,373
On account of guys
like Uncle Georgie.

1254
01:08:14,446 --> 01:08:16,880
Fellas at work used to holler,

1255
01:08:16,949 --> 01:08:19,611
"Scanatanootz, what do you hear
from the mob?"

1256
01:08:19,685 --> 01:08:22,449
I was embarrassed, and like a dope,

1257
01:08:22,521 --> 01:08:25,490
<i>I changed my name to Hopper.</i>

1258
01:08:25,557 --> 01:08:28,822
I let those son of a bitches
steal my "Italian-ness" from me.

1259
01:08:28,894 --> 01:08:30,987
You understand?

1260
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,068
<i>[Buzz Saw]</i>

1261
01:08:38,136 --> 01:08:40,331
Good morning.

1262
01:08:40,405 --> 01:08:43,306
Can I help you with that?

1263
01:08:43,375 --> 01:08:45,809
Yeah, thanks.

1264
01:08:46,345 --> 01:08:48,575
In there.

1265
01:08:48,647 --> 01:08:51,878
I'm glad to see that
you got home okay last night.

1266
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:55,078
- I was up all night thinking.
- I was, too.

1267
01:08:55,153 --> 01:08:57,417
Stevie, here's the thing.

1268
01:08:57,489 --> 01:09:01,585
I don't want to be
in business with your uncle.

1269
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:04,151
How do I get out of it?

1270
01:09:04,229 --> 01:09:07,926
This is very difficult.
He likes you.

1271
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,865
It's nice to be liked,

1272
01:09:09,935 --> 01:09:12,426
but I don't feel comfortable in this.

1273
01:09:12,504 --> 01:09:14,665
It's like a personal thing.

1274
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:17,004
I wish I could help.

1275
01:09:17,075 --> 01:09:19,168
I have great respect for you,

1276
01:09:19,244 --> 01:09:22,179
but I have to show
allegiance to my family.

1277
01:09:22,247 --> 01:09:24,875
There are certain traditions,

1278
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:27,180
you understand.

1279
01:09:27,252 --> 01:09:29,720
This is a very distressing situation,

1280
01:09:29,788 --> 01:09:33,224
especially because of what
I've been thinking about last night.

1281
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:35,316
What's that?

1282
01:09:35,394 --> 01:09:37,726
Well,

1283
01:09:37,796 --> 01:09:40,230
I would like to ask you formally,

1284
01:09:40,298 --> 01:09:42,289
and with great respect,

1285
01:09:42,367 --> 01:09:45,996
for permission to start
seeing your daughter.

1286
01:09:47,205 --> 01:09:50,038
I don't even want
to sell you my house.

1287
01:09:50,108 --> 01:09:53,566
I understand, but I ask
with the utmost regards...

1288
01:09:53,645 --> 01:09:55,909
Let me explain something.

1289
01:09:55,981 --> 01:09:59,075
And I'm not saying this
'cause she's my daughter.

1290
01:09:59,151 --> 01:10:02,780
This is a girl with heart, with soul.

1291
01:10:02,854 --> 01:10:05,789
She's a jewel, not a cupcake.

1292
01:10:05,857 --> 01:10:08,451
I do not regard her as a cupcake.

1293
01:10:08,527 --> 01:10:10,495
I understand your concern.

1294
01:10:10,562 --> 01:10:13,531
I have met some girls
who were true cannolis,

1295
01:10:13,598 --> 01:10:16,567
but I have the highest
respect for Connie.

1296
01:10:16,635 --> 01:10:19,331
With your approval,
I would like to express...

1297
01:10:19,404 --> 01:10:22,134
the seriousness
of my intentions to her.

1298
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:25,142
How about if we just think about...

1299
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:28,737
how I can get out of business
with your uncle?

1300
01:10:28,814 --> 01:10:31,112
Certainly, certainly.

1301
01:10:31,183 --> 01:10:34,016
Perhaps we could both
think about this.

1302
01:10:34,086 --> 01:10:35,018
Good.

1303
01:10:35,087 --> 01:10:38,147
I would not want to cause you
the slightest discomfort.

Thank you.

1305
01:10:40,258 --> 01:10:42,522

I lost Betsy.

1312

She was about 10 or 11,

1313
01:11:21,326 --> 01:11:24,784
and this guy without a face
was trying to take her away.

1314
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:28,424
But the wedding doesn't bother you.

1315
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,491
The wedding?

- Don't worry.

1351
01:13:37,162 --> 01:13:40,859
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me. Check again.

1352
01:13:40,932 --> 01:13:44,368
I believe you'll find
our name on that list.

1353
01:13:45,737 --> 01:13:48,365
Would you excuse me one moment?

1354
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:51,204
Absolutely.

1355
01:13:51,276 --> 01:13:53,938
- Without an invitation.
- What?

1356
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:57,311
Okay, one second.
Excuse me.

1357
01:14:01,686 --> 01:14:04,177
Can I see you for a second?

1358
01:14:04,255 --> 01:14:06,689
Stevie Dee and Uncle Georgie
are here.

1359
01:14:06,758 --> 01:14:08,851
Did you invite them?

1360
01:14:08,927 --> 01:14:11,555
They'd be insulted not to be invited.

1361
01:14:11,630 --> 01:14:14,827
What'll it hurt to let them
have something to eat?

1362
01:14:14,899 --> 01:14:18,494
The last time we had dinner,
I nearly drove away dead.

1363
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:20,936
Three extra people, that's all.

1364
01:14:21,006 --> 01:14:25,636
Let them have some chicken.
A little wing, a claw.

1365
01:14:25,710 --> 01:14:28,804
Oh, Morris, there you are.

1366
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,575
Rose.

1367
01:14:30,649 --> 01:14:33,812
Hello. You look nice.

1368
01:14:33,885 --> 01:14:36,547
How you doin'?

1369
01:15:11,356 --> 01:15:15,087
- <i>[Thunder]</i>
- <i>Do you take Jake to be your husband,</i>

1370
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,151
<i>to cherish him</i>
<i>in sickness and in health,</i>

1371
01:15:17,228 --> 01:15:20,356
- <i>all the days of your life?</i>
- I do.

1372
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:23,458
<i>Do you, Jake Terence Lovell,</i>

1373
01:15:23,535 --> 01:15:25,969
take Elizabeth to be your wife,

1374
01:15:26,037 --> 01:15:29,234
to love, to cherish her
in sickness and in health,

1375
01:15:29,307 --> 01:15:33,209
- <i>all the days of your life?</i>
- I do.

1376
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:36,145
Then I pronounce you
husband and wife.

1377
01:15:36,214 --> 01:15:38,512
Now, you can step on the glass,

1378
01:15:38,583 --> 01:15:40,949
which signifies
the destruction of the...

1379
01:15:41,019 --> 01:15:43,146
of times gone by,

1380
01:15:43,221 --> 01:15:45,712
<i>of a turning to the future.</i>

1381
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:47,815
You belong, not to your parents,

1382
01:15:47,892 --> 01:15:51,259
<i>but to each other, ;
Not to their families,</i>

1383
01:15:51,329 --> 01:15:52,956
<i>but to your own.</i>

1384
01:15:53,031 --> 01:15:57,559
The future,
with God's help, is yours.

1385
01:15:59,504 --> 01:16:01,995
Mazel tov!

1386
01:16:10,019 --> 01:16:12,010
<i>[Thunder]</i>

1387
01:16:13,156 --> 01:16:16,182
<i>% % % % ["Moondance"]</i>

1388
01:16:26,536 --> 01:16:29,767
Excuse me.
May I help you?

1389
01:16:29,839 --> 01:16:32,171
Would you come with me, please?

1390
01:16:32,241 --> 01:16:34,937
There's been a slight mix-up
with the seating.

1391
01:16:41,617 --> 01:16:43,710
Mozzarella!

1392
01:16:48,825 --> 01:16:51,191
<i>[Gloria] Are you serious?</i>

1393
01:16:52,628 --> 01:16:56,064
<i>Oscar, look at Fran.</i>
<i>She lost 100 pounds.</i>

1394
01:16:56,132 --> 01:16:59,727
Really? You're kidding.

1395
01:16:59,802 --> 01:17:02,066
How'd you do it?

1396
01:17:02,138 --> 01:17:04,368
You look wonderful.

1397
01:17:05,475 --> 01:17:09,343
Hi, all the seats
at my table are taken.

1398
01:17:09,412 --> 01:17:13,280
- Can I sit with you?
- Oh, sure.

1399
01:17:13,349 --> 01:17:16,512
What are you trying to do?
Are you crazy?

1400
01:17:16,586 --> 01:17:20,784
- I hope I'm not imposing.
- Don't be silly.

1401
01:17:20,857 --> 01:17:23,724
This is my first meal in a week...

1402
01:17:23,793 --> 01:17:26,626
that's not take-out Chinese food.

1403
01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:29,928
She's always working.

1404
01:17:29,999 --> 01:17:33,025
I leave the office,
she's working away.

1405
01:17:33,102 --> 01:17:36,902
<i>After a while, you look forward</i>
<i>to something different.</i>

1406
01:17:36,973 --> 01:17:39,635
I never thought
she'd make the wedding.

1407
01:17:39,709 --> 01:17:42,803
Stacks of papers.
That's my secretary.

1408
01:17:49,852 --> 01:17:53,413
I still think about nothing but you.

1409
01:17:53,489 --> 01:17:56,014
Did you get my letters?

1410
01:17:56,092 --> 01:17:58,185
Yeah.

1411
01:17:58,261 --> 01:18:00,957
I'm embarrassed at
what a coward I've been...

1412
01:18:01,030 --> 01:18:03,624
for not answering them.

1413
01:18:04,901 --> 01:18:07,392
I can't talk to you about this...

1414
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:10,030
while we're dancing to this music.

1415
01:18:10,106 --> 01:18:13,303
Music has a big effect
on you, doesn't it?

1416
01:18:13,376 --> 01:18:14,308
Yeah.

1417
01:18:14,377 --> 01:18:16,607
I admire that.

1418
01:18:16,679 --> 01:18:19,443
Why don't we sit down for a minute?

1419
01:18:19,515 --> 01:18:21,745
Certainly.

1420
01:18:31,094 --> 01:18:34,029
Stevie,

1421
01:18:34,097 --> 01:18:36,793
I'm very attracted to you.

1422
01:18:36,866 --> 01:18:39,334
I just don't think...

1423
01:18:39,402 --> 01:18:42,371
there's any future in this for us.

1424
01:18:42,438 --> 01:18:45,134
I think perhaps there is.

1425
01:18:45,208 --> 01:18:47,870
You haven't even
gotten to know me yet,

1426
01:18:47,944 --> 01:18:50,708
and already you're attracted to me.

1427
01:18:50,780 --> 01:18:53,044
I think that the odds...

1428
01:18:53,116 --> 01:18:55,346
are very good for our future.

1429
01:18:55,418 --> 01:18:57,750
No, no, we...

1430
01:18:57,820 --> 01:19:00,812
We have very different backgrounds.

1431
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:02,619
I know.

1432
01:19:02,692 --> 01:19:05,593
You're half Jewish.

1433
01:19:05,661 --> 01:19:07,959
I could become half Jewish.

1434
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:10,260
That's not what I mean.

1435
01:19:10,333 --> 01:19:12,267
Stevie,

1436
01:19:12,335 --> 01:19:14,132
I'm a cop,

1437
01:19:15,738 --> 01:19:18,536
and you're...

1438
01:19:18,608 --> 01:19:20,542
not.

1439
01:19:20,610 --> 01:19:23,306
Connie,

1440
01:19:23,379 --> 01:19:26,348
I could be anything that you want.

1441
01:19:26,415 --> 01:19:29,475
I could do anything
for the woman that I love.

1442
01:19:29,552 --> 01:19:32,020
You are the blood in my veins.

1443
01:19:32,088 --> 01:19:34,488
I would walk through fire for you.

1444
01:19:34,557 --> 01:19:39,585
I believe that people
should think with their heart.

1445
01:19:39,662 --> 01:19:42,927
I will always be available.

1446
01:19:42,999 --> 01:19:45,797
I belong to you.

1447
01:20:23,206 --> 01:20:25,731
Excuse me, Mr. Hopper.

1448
01:20:25,808 --> 01:20:29,244
In our family, it's a tradition
to celebrate a wedding...

1449
01:20:29,312 --> 01:20:32,543
with a very old, very special <i>grappa.</i>

1450
01:20:32,615 --> 01:20:35,413
Perhaps I can offer a little sip.

1451
01:20:35,484 --> 01:20:40,512
- Sure.
- Now this is a very fine <i>grappa.</i>

1452
01:20:40,590 --> 01:20:42,524
<i>Cent'anni.</i>

1453
01:20:45,695 --> 01:20:48,027
It's good, isn't it?

1454
01:20:48,097 --> 01:20:50,588
Doesn't smell like gasoline.

1455
01:20:50,666 --> 01:20:53,226
Speaking of tradition,

1456
01:20:53,302 --> 01:20:57,033
I have been thinking about
our previous conversation.

1457
01:20:57,106 --> 01:21:00,269
- Yeah?
- I believe sometimes young people...

1458
01:21:00,343 --> 01:21:02,607
observe traditions in their own way,

1459
01:21:02,678 --> 01:21:04,612
but not always
as their families wish.

1460
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:06,079
I've noticed that.

1461
01:21:06,148 --> 01:21:08,912
This is not always a bad thing.

1462
01:21:08,985 --> 01:21:12,318
Sometimes a young person
has to make their own life.

1463
01:21:13,856 --> 01:21:17,053
For example,
I owe allegiance to my family,

1464
01:21:17,126 --> 01:21:19,560
but I still want
to show respect to you.

1465
01:21:19,629 --> 01:21:21,824
As an act of good faith,

1466
01:21:21,897 --> 01:21:24,730
I believe I can help you
extricate yourself...

1467
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,963
from this arrangement
you have with my Uncle Georgie.

1468
01:21:28,037 --> 01:21:30,505
Um,

1469
01:21:30,573 --> 01:21:33,542
- how would this work?
- I believe...

1470
01:21:33,609 --> 01:21:35,907
I can arrange it with my uncle...

1471
01:21:35,978 --> 01:21:38,276
for you to come out even on this.

1472
01:21:38,347 --> 01:21:41,248
You get your house back,
sell it to whomever you want.

1473
01:21:41,317 --> 01:21:43,308
He'll go along with that?

1474
01:21:43,386 --> 01:21:47,254
Just say to him like this:
"I'm not happy."

1475
01:21:47,323 --> 01:21:50,656
In this way, he will understand
that you want out.

1476
01:21:50,726 --> 01:21:54,389
Show him respect by allowing
him to make the decision.

1477
01:21:54,463 --> 01:21:55,691
How?

1478
01:21:55,765 --> 01:21:58,563
You just say to him like this:

1479
01:21:58,634 --> 01:22:02,297
"I don't think I can give you
what you want on this job."

1480
01:22:02,371 --> 01:22:06,171
- And then he lets me go?
- Maybe he kills you,

1481
01:22:06,242 --> 01:22:08,574
but I think he lets you go.

1482
01:22:09,812 --> 01:22:13,407
Please, do not feel
obligated to me in any way.

1483
01:22:13,482 --> 01:22:15,814
This is my pleasure.

1484
01:22:18,621 --> 01:22:21,055
[Indistinct]

1485
01:22:27,563 --> 01:22:30,031
You know, Uncle Georgie,

1486
01:22:30,099 --> 01:22:33,330
I'm always lookin' to figure
what to do with my life.

1487
01:22:33,402 --> 01:22:36,838
Give it some thought,
and you'll know what to do.

1488
01:22:36,906 --> 01:22:40,103
You ask yourself,
"Do I like vending machines?

1489
01:22:40,176 --> 01:22:42,906
Do I like refuse removal?"

1490
01:22:42,978 --> 01:22:47,176
- Refuse can be a very nice life.
- This is what I mean.

1491
01:22:47,249 --> 01:22:51,208
I've been thinking about
my life, what I should do.

1492
01:22:51,287 --> 01:22:54,347
That's what I'm saying.
This is good.

1493
01:22:54,423 --> 01:22:57,358
After thinking about it,
I have finally decided on...

1494
01:22:57,426 --> 01:23:00,418
what would be a good path
for me to take in my life.

1495
01:23:00,496 --> 01:23:03,021
Now you're thinking with your brains.

1496
01:23:03,099 --> 01:23:07,195
- What are you gonna do?
- Next month,

1497
01:23:07,269 --> 01:23:10,261
<i>I'm gonna apply</i>
<i>to the Police Academy.</i>

1498
01:23:13,409 --> 01:23:16,344
This is some tent
my brother-in-law got me.

1499
01:23:16,412 --> 01:23:18,107
What's wrong with it?

1500
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:21,513
I want to talk something
over with you.

1501
01:23:21,584 --> 01:23:23,176
Yeah?

1502
01:23:25,788 --> 01:23:29,383
I mean, if that would
meet with your approval.

1503
01:23:29,458 --> 01:23:32,188
<i>I say this with respect...</i>

1504
01:23:32,261 --> 01:23:34,729
for your feelings about talking.

1505
01:23:34,797 --> 01:23:36,890
<i>What is it?</i>

1506
01:23:39,301 --> 01:23:42,702
This is a hell of a tent.
Look at the way this leaks.

1507
01:23:42,772 --> 01:23:46,105
If Oscar told me "rain tent,"
I could have gotten you one.

1508
01:23:46,175 --> 01:23:48,370
What do you expect for nothing?

1509
01:23:48,444 --> 01:23:51,971
Wait.
You got this tent for nothing?

1510
01:23:52,047 --> 01:23:54,015
<i>You</i> got this tent?

1511
01:23:54,083 --> 01:23:57,280
This is a difficult concept.
Yeah, I got the tent.

1512
01:23:58,454 --> 01:24:00,945
<i>[Oscar] Will you leave it alone?</i>

1513
01:24:01,023 --> 01:24:03,218
You're making it worse.

1514
01:24:03,292 --> 01:24:05,055
<i>Sit down.</i>

1515
01:24:05,127 --> 01:24:06,992
What's this kid's name?

1516
01:24:07,062 --> 01:24:09,496
<i>It's a little leak, that's all.</i>

1517
01:24:09,565 --> 01:24:11,430
Just enjoy yourself.

1518
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,934
Would you like to dance?

1519
01:24:14,003 --> 01:24:16,836
Sure, I'd love to.

1520
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:38,187
Did you finally get the fish market?

1521
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:41,627
The fish market?
Yeah, I got the fish market.

1522
01:24:41,697 --> 01:24:44,564
That guy cost me a fortune.

1523
01:24:44,633 --> 01:24:47,397
It's like he knew
exactly how high I'd go.

1524
01:24:47,470 --> 01:24:50,837
You weren't dealing with him,
you were dealing with me.

1525
01:24:50,906 --> 01:24:51,964
What?

1526
01:24:52,041 --> 01:24:54,908
I bought it from him,
you bought it from me.

1527
01:24:54,977 --> 01:24:57,241
Why would you do that?

1528
01:24:59,215 --> 01:25:01,740
I guess mainly to get even.

1529
01:25:01,817 --> 01:25:04,115
Pretty good, huh?

1530
01:25:04,186 --> 01:25:07,644
Really, be objective.
That's not bad.

1531
01:25:07,723 --> 01:25:09,748
That is disgusting.

1532
01:25:09,825 --> 01:25:12,259
I can't believe you did that.

1533
01:25:12,328 --> 01:25:15,126
How could you do that
to your husband?

1534
01:25:15,197 --> 01:25:17,324
I'm your family.

1535
01:25:17,399 --> 01:25:21,460
You're quite the family man.
You're cheating on your wife!

1536
01:25:21,537 --> 01:25:23,903
<i>You're cheating on this secretary...</i>

1537
01:25:23,973 --> 01:25:26,464
you're underpaying and overscrewing.

1538
01:25:26,542 --> 01:25:28,533
This is ridiculous.

1539
01:25:28,611 --> 01:25:31,478
I don't have to listen
to that kind of talk.

1540
01:25:31,547 --> 01:25:34,948
You're a rat, Oscar.
You belong in a pack.

1541
01:25:35,017 --> 01:25:37,485
You don't want people to hear this.

1542
01:25:37,553 --> 01:25:41,353
If we had children, you probably
would have eaten them.

1543
01:25:41,423 --> 01:25:42,515
I love my family.

1544
01:25:42,591 --> 01:25:45,526
Look at this tent you get
your brother-in-law!

1545
01:25:45,594 --> 01:25:48,085
- Get your hand off of that!
- It's falling apart!

1546
01:25:48,163 --> 01:25:50,859
I said, get your hand off that.

1547
01:25:50,933 --> 01:25:54,664
I am sick and tired
of your insane accusations.

1548
01:25:54,737 --> 01:25:57,331
Let go of that and sit down!

1549
01:25:58,274 --> 01:25:59,741
Sit!

1550
01:25:59,808 --> 01:26:02,800
Oh, Oscar, go fuck yourself.

1551
01:26:10,252 --> 01:26:12,117
<i>Damn it, Oscar!</i>

1552
01:26:12,187 --> 01:26:13,984
I gave you $3,000.

1553
01:26:14,056 --> 01:26:17,116
You sold me junk!
You cheated me!

1554
01:26:17,192 --> 01:26:19,592
Cheated you?
I saved your life!

1555
01:26:19,662 --> 01:26:21,994
I loaned you money
when you had nothing!

1556
01:26:22,064 --> 01:26:22,894
Don't poke me.

1557
01:26:22,965 --> 01:26:26,025
I'm always helping you
with money, guidance, advice!

1558
01:26:26,101 --> 01:26:28,126
Don't poke me!

1559
01:26:28,203 --> 01:26:30,137
I'm getting out of that house deal.

1560
01:26:30,205 --> 01:26:31,331
You're not out!

1561
01:26:31,407 --> 01:26:33,341
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not!

1562
01:26:33,409 --> 01:26:35,400
Yes I am, and don't poke me!

1563
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:39,714
Am I wet?

1564
01:26:39,782 --> 01:26:41,841
Well, just a little bit.

1565
01:26:41,917 --> 01:26:43,851
You pushed me through the tent?

1566
01:26:43,919 --> 01:26:45,011
What do you want?

1567
01:26:45,087 --> 01:26:48,079
- You slipped and fell.
- Keep away from me!

1568
01:26:48,157 --> 01:26:50,990
Did you see him push me?
I want your names later.

1569
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:53,187
Did you see him push me?

1570
01:26:53,262 --> 01:26:56,254
You pocketed $3,000.
I owe a guy a favor for this tent.

1571
01:26:56,332 --> 01:26:58,766
What do you mean, you're out?

1572
01:26:58,834 --> 01:27:01,200
Georgie, with all due respect,

1573
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:03,295
I'm not happy.

1574
01:27:03,372 --> 01:27:05,966
- What?
- <i>I don't think I can give you...</i>

1575
01:27:06,041 --> 01:27:08,202
what you want on this job.

1576
01:27:08,277 --> 01:27:10,643
I don't need this shit.
You're out.

1577
01:27:10,713 --> 01:27:13,841
- We'll replace him.
- You're out, too.

1578
01:27:13,916 --> 01:27:16,214
- We're associated.
- Associated?

1579
01:27:16,285 --> 01:27:19,015
You clip me for $3,000,
you get me all wet,

1580
01:27:19,088 --> 01:27:21,648
and my nephew's
talking like a citizen.

1581
01:27:21,724 --> 01:27:24,192
Are you trying to destroy my life?

1582
01:27:24,259 --> 01:27:27,490
Listen to me.
Let's not get emotional about this.

1583
01:27:27,563 --> 01:27:29,588
We can work this out.

1584
01:27:39,441 --> 01:27:41,170
Oh, my God.

1585
01:27:41,243 --> 01:27:43,575
I think we better get out of here.

1586
01:27:43,646 --> 01:27:45,841
Oh, my God!

1587
01:27:52,021 --> 01:27:53,283
Oh, my...

1588
01:28:02,564 --> 01:28:04,225
Betsy!

1589
01:28:24,554 --> 01:28:27,489
% % ["Embraceable You"]

1590
01:28:46,642 --> 01:28:49,577
I'm sorry it didn't turn out
the way I thought it would.

1591
01:28:49,645 --> 01:28:52,580
I wanted your wedding to be
something you'd never forget.

1592
01:28:52,648 --> 01:28:55,481
I don't think I could
ever forget this.

1593
01:29:26,215 --> 01:29:28,911
I just felt it.
She's gone.

1594
01:29:28,985 --> 01:29:31,715
- How are you doing?
- What could be bad?

1595
01:29:31,787 --> 01:29:33,755
I just gave her away...

1596
01:29:33,823 --> 01:29:36,257
in the world's most
expensive pizza parlor,

1597
01:29:36,325 --> 01:29:38,816
and if we're lucky, we'll break even.

1598
01:29:38,894 --> 01:29:42,159
When we break even,
that's money in the bank.

1599
01:29:45,968 --> 01:29:49,597
I'm very touched
by what you did for my father.

1600
01:29:49,672 --> 01:29:52,607
Connie, it would make me
extremely happy...

1601
01:29:52,675 --> 01:29:55,269
if you would grant me the honor...

1602
01:29:55,344 --> 01:29:58,336
of considering your
feelings toward me.

1603
01:29:58,414 --> 01:30:00,746
I don't ask for a commitment,

1604
01:30:00,816 --> 01:30:03,944
just that you would
consider what you feel.

1605
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:05,954
Stevie,

1606
01:30:07,323 --> 01:30:10,622
I'm considering.

1607
01:30:10,693 --> 01:30:14,129
This makes me the happiest of men.

1608
01:30:20,870 --> 01:30:23,862
Could you start wearing this
off to the side?

1609
01:30:23,939 --> 01:30:26,203
Absolutely.

1610
01:30:38,954 --> 01:30:42,253
Oh, God, please, let them elope!

1611
01:34:01,504 --> 01:34:03,253
The end...
