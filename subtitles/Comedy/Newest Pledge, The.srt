2
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:08,425
HxHPRC: Enjoy your hours!

3
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,959
She said it.

4
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,961
She said it.

5
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,964
She did.

6
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,953
--with some precipitation
in the Central Valley.

7
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:31,957
Reno area, a little milder.
Looking like a low 37 degrees...

8
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,959
...and a high at 42.

9
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,962
The low-pressure system
continues into the Sierras.

10
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:41,925
We've got some snow flurries at times
down at about 5000 feet.

11
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,970
We'll see some hazy sunshine
in the morning.

12
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:48,974
Yo, Mick.

13
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:51,935
Yeah, okay.

14
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:52,978
Thank you.

15
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:12,998
- Good morning.
- Jerry.

16
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:20,964
- There you are.
- Morning.

17
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,928
Plug that fridge back in.
I thought it was going with you.

18
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:29,932
I put everything in boxes.
Everything except your pictures.

19
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:33,936
Every time I pack pictures, something
gets broken and I get blamed.

20
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:34,978
So you can do that yourself.

21
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,940
Don't forget lunch
with the lieutenant.

22
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,945
- It's at 1 :30.
- At the Luau.

23
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,989
It's at 1 :30 at the Luau.

24
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,951
Thank you, Jean.

25
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,994
I'm out here if you need me.

26
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:36,975
Driver of the yellow car, Reno police.
No more parking on the street today.

27
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:41,980
Move it.

28
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,989
Come on, Stan, you're late.

29
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,980
Surprise.

30
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:38,996
Congratulations, Jerry.

31
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:43,000
- I saw you parking on the street.
- You saw that?

32
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,961
Hey, Larry. You outlasted me.

33
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:47,921
Hey, thanks for coming.

34
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,966
- Good to see you. Thanks.
- Congratulations.

35
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:30,983
Isn't that smart?

36
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:34,987
Thank you. Thank you.

37
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:40,951
Knowing you like we do, Jerry...

38
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:42,953
...we thought it was time
you got that marlin...

39
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:45,956
...you been dreaming about
for all these years.

40
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:48,917
So the whole department,
officers, staff...

41
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,921
...volunteers, everybody,
we all pooled our nickels together...

42
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,923
...and got you this ticket.

43
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,926
It's supposed to be the best
marlin fishing in Baja.

44
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:00,971
So go catch a big one for us, Jer.

45
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:08,979
Gee.

46
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,981
Well.

47
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,984
Appreciation all around.

48
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,989
What can I say? You shouldn't have.

49
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,991
But you did...

50
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:26,997
...and it hits me deep.

51
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:30,000
Thank you.

52
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:08,932
I'm going back to the station.
Get Becker County on the phone.

53
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:11,935
- You should go on.
- It'll be dark when we get there.

54
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:12,978
Thanks.

55
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,981
What's up?

56
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:17,983
- Juvenile homicide.
- Becker County.

57
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:20,944
Possible sexual assault. Little girl.

58
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,946
The locals aren't handling it?

59
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:25,949
Our hard-core crime unit
assists that jurisdiction now.

60
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:28,994
Jerry, for Chris sake,
you're retiring.

61
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:30,954
I still got six more hours.

62
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:34,958
As far as I'm concerned, you're gone.
It's Krolack's case.

63
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,960
- He's in charge, his call.
- It's fine with me.

64
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:41,965
- If you want to leave your own party.
- My coat's upstairs.

65
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:49,932
Good evening.
Elena Ryan, just outside of Reno.

66
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,934
Behind, you have the crime scene...

67
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:54,937
...where the body of a young girl
has just been found.

68
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:58,982
And we have emergency vehicles
coming in and out of here.

69
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:02,986
We have state troopers,
we have Reno police.

70
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:28,929
Bruising and lacerations evident
on the interior of both thighs.

71
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:33,976
Bruising and possible wrist
fractures due to restraints.

72
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:35,936
Neck slashed.

73
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:37,980
Did you get her age in there?

74
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:42,985
She was a second-grader.
I guess about 7 1/2, 8.

75
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:46,947
Coupled with signs of lividity...

76
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,992
...all indications are she wasn't
moved from place of death.

77
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:51,994
We checked the entire perimeter.

78
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,956
Even with the snow,
this path's the only way in or out.

79
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:58,917
- Why the fuck are you standing on it?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

80
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,920
--and other weather-related
contamination....

81
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,964
Whose fucking pen is this?

82
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:07,926
Oh, Jesus, that's--
It's mine. Pardon me.

83
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,928
Any sign of a weapon?

84
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,933
No, but, I mean, a knife like that,
you could chuck it pretty far.

85
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,936
- Assuming it was a knife.
- How long before you can wrap this up?

86
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:18,979
Couple more minutes.

87
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,982
I'll let the coroner know
he can pick her up.

88
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:24,943
The buttons.

89
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,988
Have the lab guys
check for prints on the buttons...

90
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,992
...on both the coat and the dress.

91
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:33,994
Goddamn it.

92
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,957
Strom, secure all the buttons
for lab work...

93
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,918
...before you move her out.

94
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,962
- Guys, get the buttons.
- Let's go, big guy.

95
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,977
What about the little girl's parents?

96
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:00,979
Duane and Margaret Larsen.

97
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,941
They got a turkey farm
10 miles from here.

98
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,944
- Good people.
- Go ahead and pick her up now.

99
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,988
- Have you interviewed them?
- No.

100
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:11,990
We haven't told them yet.

101
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,993
None of us knew what to say.

102
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:18,956
Jesus Christ.

103
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:20,999
Nobody told the little girl's parents.

104
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,962
- Is this the little boy right here?
- Yeah.

105
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:28,966
Evening, son.

106
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:33,971
Chilly out here, isn't it?

107
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:39,935
Take him to your station.
I'll talk to him there.

108
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:43,939
- Right.
- Anything on the suspect or his truck?

109
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:44,982
Hang on.

110
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,943
Highway Patrol got anything?

111
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:49,987
Todd said he put it out there.

112
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:55,951
It's out statewide,
and I got Highway Patrol on it.

113
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:57,995
Congratulations.

114
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,998
Now, who's gonna tell the parents?

115
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,919
Does anybody here know them?

116
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,964
I got one of my deputies,
but he'd rather not.

117
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,972
He'd rather not.

118
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:45,978
Most Wednesdays,
Ginny stays in town...

119
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:49,982
...for music lessons with my mother.

120
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:52,943
But when she's behind
on her homework...

121
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:55,988
...she comes straight home.

122
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:03,996
So her grandmother would've
assumed that she came home?

123
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:06,999
We always let Ginny....

124
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,959
Yes.

125
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:13,922
Excuse me.

126
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:16,925
- Pastor Holcomb's on his way over.
- Thank you.

127
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:19,928
Would you mind not smoking
in the house, please?

128
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:20,971
Sorry.

129
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,978
It isn't possible.

130
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,982
There can't be such a devil.

131
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,985
There are such devils.

132
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:45,996
I want to see my daughter.

133
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:50,959
I don't think that's
a good idea, Mr. Larsen.

134
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,923
I know what I'm saying
might sound cruel...

135
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:58,967
...but I think it's better
if you don't go to your Ginny now.

136
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:03,972
Why would it be better for me
not to see my daughter?

137
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:05,974
Why would that be better?.

138
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,984
Because we hardly dared
to look ourselves.

139
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,992
You can go to your
Ginny tomorrow evening.

140
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:30,958
Then there won't be
anything that's....

141
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:33,919
- What?
- She'll look like she fell asleep.

142
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,963
Believe me.

143
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,971
Who did this?

144
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,974
We intend to find out, Mrs. Larsen.

145
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:49,977
Do you promise me that you will?

146
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:00,988
Yes.

147
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:05,993
Yes, Mrs. Larsen, I promise.

148
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:11,999
By your soul's salvation?

149
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:18,964
Do you swear...

150
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:24,928
...by your soul's salvation
on this cross...

151
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,973
...made by the hands of our daughter?

152
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:34,980
Yes.

153
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:40,986
Yes, on my soul's salvation.

154
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:50,996
You've sworn by your salvation.

155
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:58,962
We will pray.

156
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,918
Detective.

157
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,962
Detective Black?

158
00:23:40,963 --> 00:23:42,923
Looks like they got him.

159
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:46,969
Highway Patrol picked up a match
on the truck with an Indian driver.

160
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:59,982
I gave you a new headband, Toby.
I know you lost yours.

161
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:03,944
Toby, I can't see your eyes, buddy.

162
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:05,946
You'll like this.

163
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:06,989
Let's see it.

164
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:16,999
Toby, you've already served time
for one charge of juvenile rape now.

165
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,919
Statutory.
The girl was 1 6 years old.

166
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:23,964
Toby, would you tell him
that rape is rape?

167
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:27,926
You got three years of juvenile,
you got some burglary...

168
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:30,929
...you got some theft, grand theft.

169
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:34,933
Multiple counts of marijuana
possession. Then that first rape.

170
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:38,937
Section Four.
Man's got a mental handicap, Stan.

171
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:39,938
No.

172
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,943
Well, number one, that might not
take the violence out of you.

173
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:46,987
Number two,
I'm gonna get a confession.

174
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:51,992
And number three,
I'm gonna do it in record time.

175
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,962
How you doing, chief?

176
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:08,967
Scared of this thing?
Let's get it out of the way then.

177
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:18,977
Who you talking to, chief?

178
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:26,985
You got those little voices
in your head?

179
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:36,995
- You a policeman?
- Yeah, I'm a policeman.

180
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:41,917
- I want to be a policeman too.
- You do, huh?

181
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:45,921
Policeman drive me here very fast.
Drive me fast.

182
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:49,967
- I'm just a trapper.
- We don't need this.

183
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:52,970
I trap beaver today.

184
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:56,932
Fifteen pounds or 25...

185
00:25:56,974 --> 00:26:00,978
...or 35, something like that.
Maybe 80.

186
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:03,981
You mean beaver or you mean "beaver"?

187
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:06,984
- Beaver.
- Beaver? Pretty, young pussy?

188
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,951
- I don't know you joking me.
- You think I'm joking?

189
00:26:15,993 --> 00:26:16,952
- I don't know.
- No?

190
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:19,955
I'm not joking you.
So you catch beaver, huh?

191
00:26:19,997 --> 00:26:20,998
Yeah, I--

192
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:26,920
- Yeah, I catch beaver.
- You catch beaver? Little girl?

193
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:30,924
You catch little girl today, huh?
You rape little girl?

194
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:31,967
Is that what you did?

195
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:33,927
I rape, I rape.

196
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:35,971
You raped her, huh?

197
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,981
Yeah.

198
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:49,985
He could be talking about the
other rape, the one on his record.

199
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:51,987
We got positive I.D. from the kid.

200
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:54,990
This is a small town.
Just let him do his job.

201
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:56,992
Tell me about the girl.

202
00:27:00,996 --> 00:27:02,998
You rape a little girl today?

203
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,920
It's okay.

204
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:08,962
You can tell me.

205
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:14,968
You killed her.

206
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:16,970
Didn't you, Toby?

207
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:21,975
It's all right.
It's okay, bud. Huh?

208
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:27,981
Something simply came
over you today, didn't it?

209
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:31,985
All at once you became like an animal?

210
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:38,951
You attacked and you raped her.

211
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:40,994
You raped that little girl.

212
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:50,963
Then, Toby, you know,
without wanting to--

213
00:27:51,964 --> 00:27:54,925
But sometimes you can't
stop yourself, you know?

214
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:56,969
And you murdered her, didn't you?

215
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:02,975
That hurts right there, doesn't it?

216
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:07,980
Yeah?

217
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:09,982
You like that, huh?

218
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:12,943
You like that? Huh?

219
00:28:12,985 --> 00:28:15,988
Maybe you just wanted her to be quiet.

220
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:19,992
You just wanted her
to stop screaming at you.

221
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:22,995
Something was stronger than you, Toby.

222
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:26,999
Then, when you came to yourself...

223
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,960
...you were horrified.

224
00:28:32,963 --> 00:28:34,965
Then you saw that little girl...

225
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:36,967
...and you ran.

226
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:40,929
- I ran. I ran, I ran.
- Yeah, you ran.

227
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:43,932
- Yeah. I ran.
- It's all right.

228
00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:45,976
It's all right, Toby.

229
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:49,938
- I ran.
- You ran.

230
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,983
- Yeah.
- It's all right.

231
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:00,991
You want to cry?

232
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:05,996
Come here. Come here.

233
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,961
It's all right. Come on.

234
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:17,925
You've gotta stand up
for what you did, okay?

235
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:18,926
You gotta stand up.

236
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:23,972
- He don't know what Stan's saying.
- Stand up and confess. Okay?

237
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,981
It's all right.

238
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:45,994
I killed her.

239
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:49,957
You killed her?

240
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:51,917
- I killed her.
- You killed her?

241
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:52,960
Yeah.

242
00:29:57,965 --> 00:29:59,925
- Say it.
- I killed a little girl.

243
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:01,927
- Say it.
- I killed a little girl.

244
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:03,971
You killed that little girl?

245
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:06,974
- You killed that little girl?
- Yeah, yeah.

246
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:10,936
Say it. Just put your hand
up to heaven and say it.

247
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:13,981
What did you say? Say it!

248
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:16,984
Say it, Toby!

249
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:19,945
Yeah, you killed her,
didn't you, Toby?

250
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:21,947
- Yeah, it's okay.
- I kill, I--

251
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:25,993
Toby, Toby, it's okay.
I got you. I got you.

252
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:27,995
I got you.

253
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:30,998
He practically blew him.

254
00:30:38,964 --> 00:30:39,923
Coroner just called.

255
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:42,926
They found chocolate
in the girl's stomach.

256
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:44,970
We got wrappers in the cab
of the Indian's truck.

257
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:46,972
Deputy!

258
00:30:48,974 --> 00:30:49,975
There you go.

259
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:55,981
- Come on, Toby.
- Goddamn it!

260
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:03,989
Come on, walk like a policeman, Toby.
You're a policeman now.

261
00:31:06,992 --> 00:31:07,993
Okay to use this phone?

262
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:10,996
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Christ.

263
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,963
- You fish the lakes up here, I'm told?
- Yeah.

264
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:22,925
Anglers haven't been doing much.

265
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:26,970
The spear houses have hit pretty heavy.
It could be the snow cover.

266
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:28,931
Could be that.

267
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:30,974
What about the--?

268
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:35,979
He's got my gun. He's got my gun.

269
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:41,944
- Tell me when, Jerry.
- Drop it.

270
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:42,986
- He's got Hamilton.
- Let go.

271
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:45,948
- Freeze.
- Put it down, Toby.

272
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:47,991
No.

273
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,954
Don't shoot me. Please don't.
Don't shoot me.

274
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:53,997
- Toby, put it down.
- I kill the girl.

275
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:55,999
Goddamn it. No.

276
00:32:03,966 --> 00:32:06,927
- Oh, God.
- Is everyone okay?

277
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:07,970
- Get a roll call.
- Fitz.

278
00:32:08,971 --> 00:32:08,971
I'm on it.

279
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:12,933
- Fitz.
- Hamilton. Michael.

280
00:32:12,975 --> 00:32:13,976
Are you hit?

281
00:32:15,978 --> 00:32:17,938
- I don't think so.
- Oh, Jesus.

282
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,983
All right. Oh, Mike, you all right?

283
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:25,988
Oh, my God.

284
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:30,951
- Jesus Christ.
- You all right?

285
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:32,995
- Get an ambulance. Do it.
- Right.

286
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:38,000
- I thought he was gonna kill me.
- You're all right. You're okay.

287
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:45,966
What's that, the bullet?

288
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:48,969
His tooth.

289
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:58,937
Gate 42. They'll be boarding
in about half an hour.

290
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:01,940
- Is that Concourse E?
- Yes, it is, sir.

291
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:03,984
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

292
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:05,986
Next in line, please.

293
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:09,990
Hi, how are you folks today?

294
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:12,951
Thank you.
Going to Cabo San Lucas today.

295
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:17,956
Wadenah had been previously convicted
of similar crimes and was on parole.

296
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:20,918
Regarding the suicide of
the suspect while in custody...

297
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:23,921
...State's Attorney Paul Ross
has organized a committee...

298
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:27,966
...to look into the tactics
of the Becker County Sheriff's Office.

299
00:33:30,969 --> 00:33:31,970
You okay?

300
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:34,973
Yes, thank you.

301
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:37,976
Sheriff's investigators
worked in concert...

302
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:40,979
... with Reno homicide detectives
for several hours...

303
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:46,944
...piecing together the trail that led
to the brisk apprehension of Wadenah.

304
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:49,947
Authorities here,
while understandably disturbed...

305
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:52,950
...by the brief hostage-taking
of one of their deputies...

306
00:33:52,991 --> 00:33:54,952
...are taking some comfort...

307
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:58,997
...in the swift justice of this
very dramatic evening.

308
00:34:04,962 --> 00:34:09,925
Yet, while an investigation is
underway, the consensus seems clear.

309
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:13,929
Wadenah confessed after being
identified by the young snowmobiler.

310
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:16,974
His suicide brought a brutal end....

311
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:21,979
Final boarding call, Northwest
flight 1 607 to Cabo San Lucas.

312
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:46,980
Customer, Oliver.

313
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:55,948
- Morning.
- Morning.

314
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:59,952
Nice day today. Can we help you
with anything in particular?

315
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:01,954
Well, actually, there is.

316
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:06,959
I'm looking for a person.
Annalise, or Anna-Lisa Hansen.

317
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,964
Yes. She would live above
the electric store.

318
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:16,969
That would be a small unit.
It's two doors down to your left.

319
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:22,975
And if I were you, I'd go around
the corner and take the stairs up.

320
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:26,937
You shouldn't have
any trouble finding her.

321
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:28,939
If you don't, come back.

322
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:30,941
Thank you. I appreciate it.

323
00:36:30,983 --> 00:36:31,984
You're welcome.

324
00:36:44,997 --> 00:36:48,959
So, what is it that you need to know?

325
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:53,964
Well, I'm trying to fill in the gaps.

326
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:58,927
Fit all the pieces
together, Mrs. Hansen.

327
00:36:58,969 --> 00:37:01,930
If you could remember anything...

328
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:04,975
...from when you were interviewed...

329
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:07,978
...anything in particular
that might....

330
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,941
It was Wednesday and she never came.

331
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:15,944
They said that she
never got on the bus...

332
00:37:15,986 --> 00:37:18,947
...never even made it to the school.

333
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:22,993
I assumed that she'd gone home.

334
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:30,959
What was she like?

335
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:35,923
What were your Wednesdays
with Ginny...

336
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:36,965
...what were they like?

337
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:41,970
Oh, she would come in
with her little knapsack...

338
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:45,974
...and plop it on the floor.

339
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:48,936
Give me a kiss on my cheek.

340
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:51,980
Big kiss, always my left cheek.

341
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:58,987
And then, it was time for work.

342
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:02,991
The moment she would sit
at the piano...

343
00:38:03,992 --> 00:38:05,994
...we were all business.

344
00:38:07,996 --> 00:38:09,957
And I would give her...

345
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:14,962
...her lesson just the same
as all my other pupils.

346
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:19,967
And it was no "Grandma" this
or "Grandma" that.

347
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:27,933
But the moment we were done...

348
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:29,977
...she was my Ginny again.

349
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,983
How could God be so greedy?

350
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:38,986
Ma'am, I....

351
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:47,995
And after the lesson?

352
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:51,999
Cookies.

353
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,920
We would have cookies,
if I'd baked them.

354
00:38:56,962 --> 00:39:00,924
Sometimes I would send her down
to the Land of Christmas...

355
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:04,928
...the store downstairs,
for candy or ice cream.

356
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:08,974
She would eat her sweets
and I would read to her.

357
00:39:09,975 --> 00:39:12,978
She loved Andersen.

358
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:14,980
Who?

359
00:39:15,981 --> 00:39:18,984
Do you know what he wrote
in his story "The Angel"?

360
00:39:20,986 --> 00:39:21,987
No.

361
00:39:26,992 --> 00:39:27,993
Here.

362
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:36,919
"Whenever a good child dies...

363
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,922
...an angel of God...

364
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:42,925
...comes down from Heaven...

365
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:45,969
...and takes the child in his arms.

366
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:50,974
And spreads out his great white wings.

367
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:53,977
And flies with her...

368
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:56,980
...over all the places...

369
00:39:57,981 --> 00:40:00,984
...that she loved during her life.

370
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:04,988
And then, the child carries...

371
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:10,994
...a large handful of flowers...

372
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:13,997
...up to God."

373
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:23,966
Beautiful.

374
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,985
What's your name?

375
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:46,989
Becky. Becky Fiske.

376
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,992
And you were Ginny's best friend?

377
00:40:50,993 --> 00:40:52,995
We sat together.

378
00:40:53,996 --> 00:40:54,997
She died.

379
00:40:55,998 --> 00:40:58,959
Yeah. I know.

380
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:05,966
Her grandmother told me
that Ginny liked to tell stories.

381
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,969
Sometimes.

382
00:41:11,972 --> 00:41:13,974
What kind of stories?

383
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:17,978
Ginny knew a giant.

384
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:19,980
Giant?

385
00:41:21,982 --> 00:41:23,942
Really?

386
00:41:23,984 --> 00:41:28,989
He was as big as a mountain
and gave her porcupines.

387
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,992
She called him "The Wizard."

388
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:34,995
Ginny made a picture of him.

389
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,960
Ginny drew a picture of a giant?

390
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:44,922
Can I see it?

391
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:46,924
It's on the wall in the hallway.

392
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:48,967
We put Ginny's picture--

393
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:54,973
I gotta go.

394
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:06,962
Jean, hold my calls.

395
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:41,997
You were supposed to be
fishing in Mexico.

396
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,959
I know, Stan.

397
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:49,922
I went to the airport.

398
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:52,966
I heard the boarding announcement.

399
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:56,970
I just didn't feel right.

400
00:43:57,971 --> 00:44:02,976
Something went off.
I need more time on this.

401
00:44:05,979 --> 00:44:08,982
You want me to reopen a case
because you got a hunch?

402
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:14,988
No offense, but you're retired.
You don't work here anymore.

403
00:44:18,992 --> 00:44:19,952
Okay.

404
00:44:19,993 --> 00:44:21,995
I know, Stan.

405
00:44:22,996 --> 00:44:26,917
I know. But could you run it
through the system for me anyway?

406
00:44:26,959 --> 00:44:28,919
You know, just a standard query.

407
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:31,964
Similar crimes, profile, victims.

408
00:44:33,966 --> 00:44:34,967
Could you?

409
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:38,971
Say, for...

410
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:47,980
...the last 10, 1 2 years.

411
00:44:48,981 --> 00:44:49,982
Could you, Stan?

412
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,992
Please?

413
00:45:54,963 --> 00:45:57,966
This is eight years ago
when this happened.

414
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:03,931
I'm on the job only six months
when this very big deal goes down.

415
00:46:03,972 --> 00:46:06,934
Talk about baptism by fire.

416
00:46:06,975 --> 00:46:08,936
And to top off everything else...

417
00:46:08,977 --> 00:46:10,938
...it was in the summer season.

418
00:46:10,979 --> 00:46:12,981
"Politics of tourism"
and all that nonsense.

419
00:46:13,982 --> 00:46:17,945
So we all feel the pressure to make
the bogeyman of it all disappear.

420
00:46:17,986 --> 00:46:20,948
The brass were pretty clear
in the presumption...

421
00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:22,950
...that it was one
of those festival-goers...

422
00:46:22,991 --> 00:46:26,954
...which seemed like, you know,
a pretty good bet.

423
00:46:26,995 --> 00:46:30,958
And a good way to diffuse
the kind of panic that you get...

424
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:33,919
...when they feel that there's
a bogeyman amongst them.

425
00:46:33,961 --> 00:46:34,962
So we all figured...

426
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:40,968
...and I do feel accurately,
that's why we never did catch him.

427
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:45,931
The odds were on a perpetrator...

428
00:46:45,973 --> 00:46:49,977
...who'd cleared the county
before the body was ever found.

429
00:46:50,978 --> 00:46:52,980
Yeah.

430
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:56,984
Look at the slit in that neck.

431
00:46:57,985 --> 00:46:58,986
I don't know, but for me...

432
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:03,991
...it's like being in a movie.

433
00:47:04,992 --> 00:47:07,995
This stuff just doesn't bother me
like it does some people. You?

434
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:11,999
Luanne Rotze.

435
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,959
A little 10-year-old girl.

436
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,921
Real little.
I mean, real small for her age.

437
00:47:17,963 --> 00:47:19,923
You know what, though?

438
00:47:19,965 --> 00:47:22,926
As horrible as that
kind of thing is...

439
00:47:22,968 --> 00:47:25,929
...I got an adrenaline rush
being part of it.

440
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:28,974
I don't know if that's bad,
but, hey, don't hurt me.

441
00:47:29,975 --> 00:47:30,976
That's just the way it hit me.

442
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:34,938
Nothing like it
ever happened before here.

443
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,983
By the way, nothing like it
ever happened since.

444
00:47:38,984 --> 00:47:39,985
I think that says a lot.

445
00:47:41,987 --> 00:47:44,948
- You mind if I keep this one?
- I couldn't let you do that.

446
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,950
We always like to be of help...

447
00:47:46,992 --> 00:47:49,995
...but, strictly technically,
the case is still open.

448
00:47:50,996 --> 00:47:52,998
Well, then, how about the report?

449
00:47:55,959 --> 00:47:57,961
I'll make you a copy. How's that?

450
00:47:58,962 --> 00:48:00,923
Sure would appreciate it.

451
00:48:00,964 --> 00:48:02,925
But keep it between us.

452
00:48:02,966 --> 00:48:05,969
I'm not sure what the policy is
on this kind of thing. Okay?

453
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,972
My lips are sealed.

454
00:48:10,974 --> 00:48:11,975
Lucy.

455
00:48:12,976 --> 00:48:15,938
A young horse is like a woman.
Can't predict what they'll do.

456
00:48:15,979 --> 00:48:17,981
They're crazy.

457
00:48:24,988 --> 00:48:26,949
Excuse me. Sir?

458
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:27,950
Sir?

459
00:48:27,991 --> 00:48:32,955
I wonder if you could tell me where
a man named James Olstad might be?

460
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:34,998
Olstad's not a patient here.

461
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:37,960
Well, I believe he's
the custodian, sir.

462
00:48:38,961 --> 00:48:40,921
In the building, mopping?
He's not a patient.

463
00:48:40,963 --> 00:48:42,965
- Mopping in the building?
- Not a patient.

464
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:08,991
James Olstad?

465
00:49:15,998 --> 00:49:18,917
I'm Jerry Black.
I'm a police detective.

466
00:49:18,959 --> 00:49:23,964
I'd just like to talk to you
about your daughter.

467
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:27,968
What daughter?

468
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:33,974
You did have a daughter that went
missing three years ago, didn't you?

469
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:39,938
Did you come here to tell me
that something happened to her?

470
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:40,981
No, sir. It was--

471
00:49:41,982 --> 00:49:43,984
Did you find her dead or something?

472
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:47,988
No. No, sir.

473
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:50,991
We're still trying to find her.

474
00:49:54,995 --> 00:49:57,956
Anything you might tell me about her?

475
00:49:57,998 --> 00:50:00,000
Could you describe her?

476
00:50:03,962 --> 00:50:05,964
She must be--

477
00:50:10,969 --> 00:50:12,971
She must be different now.

478
00:50:17,976 --> 00:50:19,978
She was so pretty.

479
00:50:29,988 --> 00:50:31,990
I miss her so much.

480
00:50:37,996 --> 00:50:40,999
We just used to, like,
hold each other.

481
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:46,922
I was supposed to take care of her.

482
00:50:46,964 --> 00:50:49,967
She was my little girl, you know?

483
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:52,970
I just--

484
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:04,982
I had my little girl.

485
00:51:08,986 --> 00:51:10,988
Where is my baby?

486
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:15,951
The break is Monash County.
Eight years ago, we got a homicide.

487
00:51:15,993 --> 00:51:16,994
Same M.O.

488
00:51:17,995 --> 00:51:21,999
Exact same victim profile
description as the Ginny Larsen case.

489
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,960
I interviewed a local officer
for the particulars.

490
00:51:25,961 --> 00:51:30,924
Little blonde girl, 10 years old,
sexual assault, throat slit.

491
00:51:30,966 --> 00:51:33,969
The photos show that
she was wearing a red dress.

492
00:51:35,971 --> 00:51:40,934
Detectives out at Morehead covered
this case. The case is still open.

493
00:51:40,976 --> 00:51:43,937
At the time of the murders...

494
00:51:43,979 --> 00:51:46,982
...Toby Wadenah was
in Stillwater Penitentiary...

495
00:51:47,983 --> 00:51:49,943
...doing time on his
own rape conviction.

496
00:51:49,985 --> 00:51:52,946
- He couldn't have done it.
- He shot himself.

497
00:51:52,988 --> 00:51:54,948
- What more--
- You told him what he did.

498
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:57,951
Let's calm down, see what Jerry's got.
You got something?

499
00:51:57,993 --> 00:52:00,954
And there's more. More.

500
00:52:00,996 --> 00:52:02,956
Here. See here?

501
00:52:02,998 --> 00:52:07,961
This is the Larsen murder. This is
the Monash County girl. And here:

502
00:52:08,962 --> 00:52:10,923
Here, you see this pattern?

503
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:13,967
Three years ago, I got a girl gone
missing, Cathy Olstad.

504
00:52:14,968 --> 00:52:17,930
Same exact description, a little
blonde girl, 9 years old...

505
00:52:17,971 --> 00:52:21,975
...last seen wearing a red dress.

506
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:27,981
And?

507
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:30,984
And?

508
00:52:33,987 --> 00:52:34,947
Don't you see?

509
00:52:34,988 --> 00:52:37,950
I see a description that fits
a number of juvenile murders.

510
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:41,954
And a victim profile that matches
every other in the state...

511
00:52:41,995 --> 00:52:43,956
...give or take the red dress.

512
00:52:43,997 --> 00:52:47,918
Why didn't you mention her blue eyes
while you're at it? Come on.

513
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,920
I mean, whatever made you think...

514
00:52:49,962 --> 00:52:52,965
...that the Larsen girl
wasn't murdered by Wadenah?

515
00:52:54,967 --> 00:52:55,968
This did.

516
00:52:56,969 --> 00:52:57,928
This convinced me.

517
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:02,933
Ginny's drawing
of the Porcupine Giant.

518
00:53:02,975 --> 00:53:06,979
I have reason to believe, based on
my conversations and interviews...

519
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:11,984
...that Ginny Larsen made this drawing
just days before she was murdered.

520
00:53:12,985 --> 00:53:14,945
I have reason to believe
she met with this man...

521
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:18,991
...seen here as a giant, all dressed
in black, on a regular basis.

522
00:53:19,992 --> 00:53:23,954
This is not an Indian.
This is not an Indian type.

523
00:53:23,996 --> 00:53:26,957
And you see this car here?
This big, black car?

524
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:28,000
This is not a truck.

525
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,920
This is not a maroon truck
like Wadenah drove.

526
00:53:31,962 --> 00:53:34,923
This is a big, black station wagon.

527
00:53:34,965 --> 00:53:37,926
And these right here,
according to an interview I had...

528
00:53:37,968 --> 00:53:41,972
...with a girl named Beck--
Betsy Fiske...

529
00:53:42,973 --> 00:53:44,933
- ...these are porcupines.
- Okay. Whoa. Hold it.

530
00:53:44,975 --> 00:53:47,936
Porcupines and giants and--

531
00:53:47,978 --> 00:53:50,939
You got to get a hold
of yourself, Jerry.

532
00:53:50,981 --> 00:53:52,983
The case is closed.

533
00:53:54,985 --> 00:53:56,987
I made a promise.

534
00:53:57,988 --> 00:54:00,991
I made a promise to find...

535
00:54:02,993 --> 00:54:04,995
...Ginny Larsen's murderer.

536
00:54:05,996 --> 00:54:07,998
I intend to keep it.

537
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:22,971
Listen, Jerry.

538
00:54:25,974 --> 00:54:28,977
You gotta start getting on
with your life, you know?

539
00:54:30,979 --> 00:54:34,942
I mean, sometimes when you
go through big changes...

540
00:54:34,983 --> 00:54:36,944
...and retirement's one of them...

541
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:39,988
...it can cause a lot of added stress.

542
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:42,991
Sometimes it's a good idea just to...

543
00:54:43,992 --> 00:54:45,994
...talk to someone.
You know, someone...

544
00:54:46,995 --> 00:54:47,996
...professional.

545
00:54:48,997 --> 00:54:50,958
I made a promise, Eric.

546
00:54:50,999 --> 00:54:53,961
You're old enough to remember
when that meant something.

547
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:04,972
Get a life.

548
00:55:53,979 --> 00:55:56,982
Jerry, got your fresh towels here.

549
00:55:57,983 --> 00:55:59,943
Most don't need them every day.

550
00:55:59,985 --> 00:56:03,947
Please don't get them so dirty
they're not to be white again.

551
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:07,951
Here's your nice little sunroom.
You can smoke in here.

552
00:56:07,993 --> 00:56:10,996
This is the living room area.
No partying, please, no.

553
00:56:11,997 --> 00:56:14,958
Kitchen, of course.
All the amenities of home.

554
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,921
Bedroom. We just got a new mattress,
so it should be really comfy.

555
00:56:18,962 --> 00:56:21,924
And oh, yeah, trash goes
in the covered dumpster.

556
00:56:21,965 --> 00:56:26,929
Fish guts you gotta wrap and place in
the pail next to the cleaning station.

557
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:30,933
Rules and regulations
of Sugar Bush up here. Yep.

558
00:56:30,974 --> 00:56:32,935
And no nude sunbathing.

559
00:56:32,976 --> 00:56:36,939
I'll leave these here
and get Rose to make up your bed.

560
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:40,984
If there's anything else you need,
just let me know. Okey-dokey?

561
00:59:06,964 --> 00:59:07,965
Good morning.

562
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:11,969
I'll have a pack of lights.

563
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:17,975
That the owner?

564
00:59:18,976 --> 00:59:19,977
My daddy.

565
00:59:21,979 --> 00:59:22,980
What can I do for you?

566
00:59:24,982 --> 00:59:26,984
I was just having a look around.

567
00:59:27,985 --> 00:59:29,987
How long you had this place?

568
00:59:31,989 --> 00:59:32,990
Thirty years.

569
00:59:34,992 --> 00:59:36,994
Ever think about selling it?

570
00:59:37,995 --> 00:59:38,996
No.

571
00:59:40,998 --> 00:59:44,960
Well, what would it take to get
you to think about selling?

572
00:59:45,961 --> 00:59:46,962
It's not for sale.

573
00:59:50,966 --> 00:59:52,968
I'll tell you what.

574
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:57,931
I'll give you my number
over where I'm staying...

575
00:59:57,973 --> 01:00:01,935
...at Thompson's Sugar Bush Resort.

576
01:00:01,977 --> 01:00:03,979
I don't mean to be pushy but...

577
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,982
...if you'd think about it....

578
01:00:07,983 --> 01:00:10,986
I'll wait to hear from you over at
Thompson's, if it's all right.

579
01:00:11,987 --> 01:00:14,990
- Been a pleasure.
- Thanks for coming in.

580
01:00:15,991 --> 01:00:17,993
Nice place.

581
01:00:40,974 --> 01:00:43,936
You didn't tell me
you were a cop.

582
01:00:43,977 --> 01:00:46,980
- Ex-cop.
- Once a cop....

583
01:00:48,982 --> 01:00:50,943
I'm retired.

584
01:00:50,984 --> 01:00:53,946
What I wanted to tell you was
that Floyd Cage called.

585
01:00:53,987 --> 01:00:58,992
The fellow with the gas station.
He says he wants to talk to you.

586
01:00:59,993 --> 01:01:00,994
I see they're biting.

587
01:01:02,996 --> 01:01:05,958
You bet. Sure does look like it.

588
01:01:05,999 --> 01:01:07,960
You can use the phone
up in the front cabin here.

589
01:01:08,961 --> 01:01:09,962
Thank you.

590
01:01:25,978 --> 01:01:30,941
Floyd, Jerry signed all the papers.
You're ready to go.

591
01:01:30,983 --> 01:01:33,944
I sure appreciate it.
You've done a good job.

592
01:01:33,986 --> 01:01:34,987
Good luck.

593
01:01:35,988 --> 01:01:39,950
When we get a number down in Arizona,
we'll give you a call.

594
01:01:39,992 --> 01:01:41,952
I'm going to Arizona.

595
01:01:41,994 --> 01:01:42,953
Call if you forget something...

596
01:01:42,995 --> 01:01:46,957
...or want to know where something is,
or whatever....

597
01:01:46,999 --> 01:01:48,959
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you.

598
01:01:55,966 --> 01:01:56,967
I hope you'll be happy here...

599
01:01:57,968 --> 01:02:02,931
...cause you're never gonna be able
to sell it for what you paid.

600
01:02:02,973 --> 01:02:04,975
Thank you, I'll do my best.

601
01:02:05,976 --> 01:02:06,977
Is this working or what?

602
01:02:07,978 --> 01:02:11,982
I have to get a key.
I'll be right with you, thank you.

603
01:03:36,984 --> 01:03:38,986
- I'll be right with you.
- Thank you.

604
01:03:43,991 --> 01:03:45,993
What can I get you?

605
01:03:46,994 --> 01:03:47,995
Just a beer, thanks.

606
01:03:49,997 --> 01:03:51,957
You the cop
who bought the gas station?

607
01:03:51,999 --> 01:03:54,960
I'm retired from
the police department.

608
01:03:56,962 --> 01:03:58,964
And you bought Floyd's station?

609
01:04:02,968 --> 01:04:03,927
I did.

610
01:04:03,969 --> 01:04:06,930
That's a strange thing to do.
You must be an angler.

611
01:04:06,972 --> 01:04:10,976
- How'd you guess?
- Nothing else to do around here.

612
01:04:11,977 --> 01:04:12,978
Yeah.

613
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,962
Sorry about that.

614
01:04:40,964 --> 01:04:43,967
These things only work half the time.

615
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:51,975
Sign right there for me,
if you would.

616
01:04:54,978 --> 01:04:55,979
That's for you.

617
01:05:11,995 --> 01:05:12,955
Thank you and...

618
01:05:12,996 --> 01:05:15,999
- ...here's your receipt.
- Thank you, sir. Have a good day.

619
01:05:53,996 --> 01:05:56,999
All right, 10 regular.

620
01:05:58,959 --> 01:06:01,962
Nice wagon. Sticks out around here,
doesn't it?

621
01:06:02,963 --> 01:06:03,922
Never thought about it.

622
01:06:03,964 --> 01:06:06,967
Just know to get them black,
don't show dirt as much.

623
01:06:10,971 --> 01:06:13,974
Ten it is. Thanks for stopping by.

624
01:06:46,965 --> 01:06:49,927
Whenever a good child dies...

625
01:06:49,968 --> 01:06:53,931
...an angel of God
comes down from Heaven...

626
01:06:53,972 --> 01:06:56,975
...and takes the dead child
in his arms.

627
01:06:57,976 --> 01:07:01,939
And spreads out
his great white wings...

628
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:03,941
...and flies with her...

629
01:07:03,982 --> 01:07:07,986
...over all the places
that she loved in her life.

630
01:07:20,999 --> 01:07:23,961
And what do you feel
is represented here?

631
01:07:24,962 --> 01:07:28,966
Well, the porcupine giant:
Ginny told her friends...

632
01:07:29,967 --> 01:07:31,927
...that she'd meet with
a giant in the forest...

633
01:07:31,969 --> 01:07:34,930
...and that he gave her
little porcupines.

634
01:07:34,972 --> 01:07:36,932
- What do you mean?
- You see these--

635
01:07:36,974 --> 01:07:38,934
What do you mean by "porcupines"?

636
01:07:38,976 --> 01:07:40,936
I don't know exactly...

637
01:07:40,978 --> 01:07:43,939
...those are the words of
a 7-year-old girl.

638
01:07:43,981 --> 01:07:47,985
Ginny's friends. Friend, sorry.

639
01:07:48,986 --> 01:07:53,991
And this is in the imagination of a
7-year-old girl. Correct?

640
01:07:56,994 --> 01:07:59,955
You could be right. But...

641
01:07:59,997 --> 01:08:03,000
...on the other hand,
the car is very well depicted...

642
01:08:03,959 --> 01:08:06,962
- ...and the giant is--
- Giants are imaginary.

643
01:08:07,963 --> 01:08:07,963
Yes?

644
01:08:11,967 --> 01:08:14,928
A tall, heavyset man could appear...

645
01:08:14,970 --> 01:08:17,973
...to be a giant to a little girl.

646
01:08:18,974 --> 01:08:21,977
And the Indian man, was he a tall man?

647
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:28,984
Not a giant. But tall, yes.

648
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:37,993
Why did you bring this to me,
Mr. Black?

649
01:08:40,996 --> 01:08:41,955
Sorry?

650
01:08:41,997 --> 01:08:45,000
Why did you bring this to me,
Mr. Black?

651
01:08:50,964 --> 01:08:53,926
I need to know who I'm looking for.

652
01:08:53,967 --> 01:08:56,929
I'm like a layman
looking at an x-ray.

653
01:08:56,970 --> 01:09:00,933
I don't know how to read it.
I need help interpreting it.

654
01:09:00,974 --> 01:09:03,936
This drawing can tell you
nothing about...

655
01:09:03,977 --> 01:09:07,940
...the murderer. It only tells you
about the child who drew it.

656
01:09:07,981 --> 01:09:12,945
Without more information, I don't
think I can be of any value to you.

657
01:09:12,986 --> 01:09:15,948
Humor me, doc.

658
01:09:15,989 --> 01:09:20,953
Consider this a working hypothesis
and assume for the moment...

659
01:09:20,994 --> 01:09:22,996
...that this is a drawing
of the murderer.

660
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:28,961
Well.

661
01:09:31,964 --> 01:09:33,966
Your giant certainly looks
tall, massive...

662
01:09:34,967 --> 01:09:35,968
...very imposing.

663
01:09:36,969 --> 01:09:39,930
If this depicts the relationship
between the giant and the girl...

664
01:09:39,972 --> 01:09:41,974
...then these things
you call "porcupines"...

665
01:09:42,975 --> 01:09:44,935
...appear to be gifts
that she's accepting.

666
01:09:44,977 --> 01:09:46,937
That's implying a trust.

667
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:49,982
Was the girl in Monash
killed the same way?

668
01:09:52,985 --> 01:09:53,944
Exactly the same.

669
01:09:53,986 --> 01:09:56,989
Do the victims resemble one another?

670
01:09:58,991 --> 01:10:00,951
Yes, a lot.

671
01:10:00,993 --> 01:10:03,996
What were the time intervals
between the murders?

672
01:10:04,997 --> 01:10:08,917
The Monash County case was
eight years ago.

673
01:10:08,959 --> 01:10:09,960
The little girl missing, three.

674
01:10:10,961 --> 01:10:14,923
And Ginny was just....
Just last winter.

675
01:10:14,965 --> 01:10:16,967
So the intervals are getting shorter.

676
01:10:18,969 --> 01:10:21,930
If that's the case, then yes,
you could--

677
01:10:21,972 --> 01:10:24,933
Remember, this is a hypothetical case.

678
01:10:24,975 --> 01:10:28,937
But yes, you could expect
another incident within...

679
01:10:28,979 --> 01:10:29,980
...a matter of months.

680
01:10:30,981 --> 01:10:33,984
Maybe a year,
if the opportunity arose.

681
01:10:34,985 --> 01:10:36,945
But this could just be a product...

682
01:10:36,987 --> 01:10:39,990
...of a 7-year-old child's
imagination.

683
01:10:45,996 --> 01:10:46,997
Right.

684
01:10:54,963 --> 01:10:56,965
You came to me for help.

685
01:10:57,966 --> 01:11:00,969
- Yes.
- Mind if I ask you some questions?

686
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:03,972
Shoot.

687
01:11:05,974 --> 01:11:06,975
You recently retired, right?

688
01:11:09,978 --> 01:11:10,979
Yes.

689
01:11:12,981 --> 01:11:14,983
Have you always been a chainsmoker?

690
01:11:15,984 --> 01:11:19,988
Impossible.
There can't be such a devil.

691
01:11:20,989 --> 01:11:24,993
- You always been a chainsmoker?
- Yes, there are such devils.

692
01:11:25,994 --> 01:11:27,996
Recent. Recent.

693
01:11:29,998 --> 01:11:32,918
- Do you swear...
- Are you still sexually active?

694
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,920
...by your soul's salvation....

695
01:11:34,962 --> 01:11:36,964
Are you still sexually active?

696
01:11:37,965 --> 01:11:39,925
Are you still sexually active?

697
01:11:39,967 --> 01:11:43,971
- Yes, by my soul's salvation....
- Does that embarrass you?

698
01:11:44,972 --> 01:11:45,973
Experienced any....

699
01:11:47,975 --> 01:11:50,978
Have you experienced
any sudden fevers, perspiration?

700
01:11:51,979 --> 01:11:54,940
- No.
- Get a hold of yourself, Jerry!

701
01:11:54,982 --> 01:11:56,942
Or voices.
Do you hear voices?

702
01:11:56,984 --> 01:11:59,987
- I kill the girl. I kill the girl.
- No, goddamn it! No!

703
01:12:48,994 --> 01:12:51,997
--Lucky West's prescription is
that with the predatory fish...

704
01:12:52,998 --> 01:12:54,958
...your best bet's live bait.

705
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,920
Here you see Kwan Lee,
who's gone from worms...

706
01:12:57,961 --> 01:12:59,963
...to the little fishies.

707
01:13:02,966 --> 01:13:03,967
Where are those pancakes?

708
01:13:09,973 --> 01:13:13,977
- Don't forget your orange juice, baby.
- Can I get a touchup, please?

709
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:20,984
- Thanks, doll.
- I could use a little fresh-up too.

710
01:13:23,987 --> 01:13:27,991
Boy. Nice picture.

711
01:13:29,993 --> 01:13:30,994
Thank you.

712
01:13:33,997 --> 01:13:37,918
Aren't you gonna finish
your orange juice?

713
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,920
Mommy.

714
01:13:39,962 --> 01:13:42,923
Hi, officer. It's okay, honey,
he's a friend.

715
01:13:42,965 --> 01:13:45,926
Pack up, 'cause the bus is coming.
Any coffee?

716
01:13:45,968 --> 01:13:47,970
Yes, please.

717
01:13:56,979 --> 01:13:59,940
What name would a pretty little
girl like you have?

718
01:13:59,982 --> 01:14:00,983
Chrissy.

719
01:14:03,986 --> 01:14:04,945
That's a nice name.

720
01:14:04,987 --> 01:14:08,949
Okay, love bug, this is it.
Come on, let's go.

721
01:14:08,991 --> 01:14:10,993
Bye. Can I have a hug?

722
01:14:11,994 --> 01:14:12,995
Have a good day.

723
01:14:20,961 --> 01:14:23,922
- Beautiful little girl.
- Thank you.

724
01:14:23,964 --> 01:14:25,924
How old is she?

725
01:14:25,966 --> 01:14:30,929
She'll be 8 next month.
First day of school's always a biggie.

726
01:14:30,971 --> 01:14:33,974
- Oh, I forgot your coffee.
- Thank you.

727
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:51,992
Thank you very much.

728
01:15:00,959 --> 01:15:03,921
- There you go.
- Thank you.

729
01:15:03,962 --> 01:15:04,963
- Want some breakfast?
- Yeah.

730
01:15:06,965 --> 01:15:08,967
I'd like bacon and eggs and--

731
01:15:09,968 --> 01:15:12,971
- How do you like your eggs?
- Over easy. And rye toast.

732
01:15:13,972 --> 01:15:16,934
- Okay.
- I got a question for you.

733
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:17,935
Fire away.

734
01:15:17,976 --> 01:15:21,939
Where would an old bachelor like me
find some used furniture?

735
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:25,943
Nothing too fancy, you know.
A couch, dinette set...

736
01:15:25,984 --> 01:15:30,989
...something between not-too-expensive
and poverty-stricken range.

737
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:31,990
My range.

738
01:15:33,992 --> 01:15:34,993
There's a flea market up--

739
01:15:35,994 --> 01:15:39,957
You go right up Old Pass Road.
Go north about 25 miles up here...

740
01:15:39,998 --> 01:15:41,959
...and you're gonna hit a T-junction.

741
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,922
It's gonna fork into two roads,
two dirt roads. There's no sign--

742
01:15:46,964 --> 01:15:48,966
Do you like shopping?

743
01:15:57,975 --> 01:16:00,978
- Mommy, can I have a balloon?
- Yeah.

744
01:16:01,979 --> 01:16:03,939
- What color?
- Here, I got it.

745
01:16:03,981 --> 01:16:04,940
Orange.

746
01:16:04,982 --> 01:16:08,944
- Orange. There you go.
- Well, you got pink.

747
01:16:08,986 --> 01:16:11,947
- That's okay.
- Pink? I like pink too.

748
01:16:11,989 --> 01:16:13,991
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

749
01:16:16,994 --> 01:16:18,996
I'm looking for Formica here.

750
01:16:20,998 --> 01:16:23,000
- It wipes easy.
- That won't be a problem.

751
01:16:32,968 --> 01:16:36,972
- What about this one right here?
- It gives a room a very warm feeling.

752
01:16:37,973 --> 01:16:40,976
- This one's oak veneer.
- Veneer, huh?

753
01:16:41,977 --> 01:16:45,981
- I can take $5 off the top.
- What would that bring the total to?

754
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:55,991
Where's Chrissy?

755
01:16:56,992 --> 01:16:57,951
- Chrissy?
- Where is she?

756
01:16:57,993 --> 01:17:00,954
- She was just right here.
- Chrissy.

757
01:17:00,996 --> 01:17:01,955
I'll come back.

758
01:17:01,997 --> 01:17:02,998
Chrissy.

759
01:17:05,959 --> 01:17:06,960
Chrissy.

760
01:17:20,974 --> 01:17:21,975
She's on the swing.

761
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:29,983
- Bye.
- Chrissy.

762
01:17:33,987 --> 01:17:37,950
- Don't leave me like that.
- Mommy, that girl gave this to me.

763
01:17:37,991 --> 01:17:39,952
Isn't it cute?

764
01:17:39,993 --> 01:17:40,994
- What is it?
- A boot cleaner...

765
01:17:41,995 --> 01:17:45,958
...in the shape of a porcupine.
It's made by a local craft artist.

766
01:17:45,999 --> 01:17:49,962
She makes doormats too.
You want to come see?

767
01:17:57,970 --> 01:18:01,932
Fifteen apiece for the little fellas,
25 for the big.

768
01:18:01,974 --> 01:18:04,977
The mats are 10 bucks even.

769
01:18:08,981 --> 01:18:11,942
You don't run this whole place
yourself, do you?

770
01:18:11,984 --> 01:18:14,945
Are you a religious man, Mr. Black?

771
01:18:14,987 --> 01:18:17,948
Baptized. But I'm not churchgoing.

772
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:19,950
You got a wife?

773
01:18:19,992 --> 01:18:23,954
Two-time loser.
What about you, ma'am?

774
01:18:23,996 --> 01:18:27,958
My son, Gary, is the true gift
of the Lord.

775
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,960
He dotes on me hand and foot, he does.

776
01:18:30,961 --> 01:18:31,962
Hardest working boy you ever saw.

777
01:18:32,963 --> 01:18:34,923
Works construction all summer...

778
01:18:34,965 --> 01:18:37,926
...runs a snowplow for the county
in the winter...

779
01:18:37,968 --> 01:18:39,970
...and ministers at our church.

780
01:18:43,974 --> 01:18:46,935
What about him?
Does he have a family, kids?

781
01:18:46,977 --> 01:18:49,980
No wife, no kids. No little ones.

782
01:18:50,981 --> 01:18:53,942
I pray, every day...

783
01:18:53,984 --> 01:18:55,986
...he'll find a woman
good enough for him.

784
01:18:56,987 --> 01:18:58,989
The Lord hasn't come through yet.

785
01:19:28,977 --> 01:19:29,978
God bless.

786
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:35,961
Closed.

787
01:20:41,967 --> 01:20:43,969
I'm closed.

788
01:20:52,978 --> 01:20:54,980
Yeah, all right, all right.

789
01:20:58,984 --> 01:20:59,985
Closed.

790
01:21:02,988 --> 01:21:03,989
Lori?

791
01:21:05,991 --> 01:21:08,952
Woman, what has happened to you?
Come in.

792
01:21:08,994 --> 01:21:09,953
Sorry....

793
01:21:09,995 --> 01:21:14,958
My ex-- I was just so scared.
He was gonna kill me.

794
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,919
It's all right.

795
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,922
- And you being a cop.
- Where's Chrissy?

796
01:21:19,963 --> 01:21:21,924
- She's in the car.
- No, no, I got it.

797
01:21:21,965 --> 01:21:25,969
She's okay, he didn't touch her.
He didn't touch her, he didn't....

798
01:21:30,974 --> 01:21:34,937
With a restraining order,
he's still gonna beat me up.

799
01:21:34,978 --> 01:21:37,940
They put him in jail and he
can't pay child support payments.

800
01:21:37,981 --> 01:21:40,943
That's why he's beating me up
to begin with.

801
01:21:40,984 --> 01:21:41,985
Ow.

802
01:21:43,987 --> 01:21:45,989
Just hold still.

803
01:21:47,991 --> 01:21:49,993
All right, this might....

804
01:21:50,994 --> 01:21:52,996
All right, that's okay now.

805
01:21:53,997 --> 01:21:57,918
Hold still for a minute because
this one might sting a little, okay?

806
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,962
Just hold still.

807
01:22:00,963 --> 01:22:02,965
Right here, that's it.

808
01:22:05,968 --> 01:22:07,970
All right, all right, okay.

809
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:10,973
Yeah.

810
01:22:13,976 --> 01:22:15,978
The eye looks okay.

811
01:22:16,979 --> 01:22:21,984
You might want to think about
getting a stitch on that lip.

812
01:22:23,986 --> 01:22:26,989
I'm gonna miss that
half-tooth of yours.

813
01:22:31,994 --> 01:22:34,997
I'll drink out of this side
for a while.

814
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,960
Listen.

815
01:22:43,964 --> 01:22:45,924
All things considered...

816
01:22:45,966 --> 01:22:50,929
...I think it might be best
if you and your girl...

817
01:22:50,971 --> 01:22:52,973
...stayed out here with me
for a while.

818
01:22:53,974 --> 01:22:54,975
- It's not why I came.
- Hear me out.

819
01:22:55,976 --> 01:22:59,980
No strings attached, no obligations.

820
01:23:00,981 --> 01:23:03,984
But I've seen these things
go from bad to worse.

821
01:23:05,986 --> 01:23:10,949
I've got more rooms out here
than I know what to do with.

822
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:12,951
I wouldn't ask anything of you.

823
01:23:12,993 --> 01:23:15,954
Except maybe help out
around the station...

824
01:23:15,996 --> 01:23:18,999
...every once in a while, when
you're feeling better.

825
01:23:25,964 --> 01:23:27,966
Just think about it.

826
01:23:28,967 --> 01:23:30,969
Just think about it.

827
01:23:34,973 --> 01:23:37,976
Mine's up here at the top....

828
01:23:40,979 --> 01:23:43,982
Mommy, this house is so big.

829
01:23:45,984 --> 01:23:48,946
- You got a whole new one, right?
- Yeah--

830
01:23:48,987 --> 01:23:49,947
Is it real?

831
01:23:49,988 --> 01:23:54,993
- It's not real. It's called a cap.
- Oh.

832
01:24:21,979 --> 01:24:25,941
--in front! It appears that
they're playing very cautiously.

833
01:24:25,983 --> 01:24:29,987
- Is that because it's a big game?
- The last time these two teams--

834
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:58,932
Pass to Murphy, in the net!
Backhand deflected by Jackson.

835
01:24:58,974 --> 01:24:59,975
Another backhand--

836
01:25:13,989 --> 01:25:15,991
Nice snowman you got going there.

837
01:25:20,996 --> 01:25:21,997
Does he have a name?

838
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,960
Should I guess?

839
01:25:29,963 --> 01:25:31,965
If I guess, will you tell me yours?

840
01:25:34,968 --> 01:25:37,971
He looks cold.
Want to put my hat on him?

841
01:25:49,983 --> 01:25:51,985
Goal.

842
01:26:08,961 --> 01:26:11,964
Has your mommy talked to you
about the Word?

843
01:26:13,966 --> 01:26:14,967
Do you know what I mean?

844
01:27:24,995 --> 01:27:26,997
- Merry Christmas, Chrissy.
- Merry Christmas.

845
01:27:28,999 --> 01:27:30,959
There she is.

846
01:27:32,961 --> 01:27:34,963
Yeah.

847
01:27:36,965 --> 01:27:37,966
- How was it?
- Good.

848
01:27:38,967 --> 01:27:39,968
Good.

849
01:27:41,970 --> 01:27:46,934
"She knew the mole would never
permit her to leave his side.

850
01:27:46,975 --> 01:27:49,937
She wept as she felt the warmth
upon her face...

851
01:27:49,978 --> 01:27:52,981
...and made ready to go back....

852
01:27:53,982 --> 01:27:57,986
Then suddenly, above the hill,
she heard a shower of notes...

853
01:27:58,987 --> 01:28:01,949
...a glorious morning song.
She looked up...

854
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:04,952
...and there was the swallow.

855
01:28:04,993 --> 01:28:07,955
She told the bird how she disliked...

856
01:28:07,996 --> 01:28:12,918
...having to marry the ugly mole
and live deep down under the earth...

857
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,920
...where the sun never shone.

858
01:28:14,962 --> 01:28:17,923
She couldn't help crying
at the thought.

859
01:28:17,965 --> 01:28:20,926
'The cold winter will soon
be here,' said the swallow.

860
01:28:20,968 --> 01:28:24,930
'I'm going far away to the warm
countries. Will you come with me?

861
01:28:24,972 --> 01:28:29,935
You can sit on my back.
Just tie yourself on with your sash...

862
01:28:29,977 --> 01:28:32,980
...and we'll fly from the ugly mole
and his dingy house...

863
01:28:33,981 --> 01:28:35,941
...far away, across the mountains...

864
01:28:35,983 --> 01:28:37,943
...to the warm countries...

865
01:28:37,985 --> 01:28:41,989
...where the sun shines more brightly
than it does here...

866
01:28:42,990 --> 01:28:46,994
...and it's always summer,
with its lovely flowers...

867
01:28:47,995 --> 01:28:50,998
...dear little Thumbelina."'

868
01:29:54,978 --> 01:29:55,979
Lori?

869
01:30:19,962 --> 01:30:21,964
Are you all right?

870
01:32:05,984 --> 01:32:06,985
Here, hon.

871
01:32:08,987 --> 01:32:12,950
Chrissy is gonna go nuts when she
sees this. This is so neat, Jerry.

872
01:32:12,991 --> 01:32:14,952
Yeah. She'll like it.

873
01:32:14,993 --> 01:32:15,994
She'll love it.

874
01:32:17,996 --> 01:32:20,958
You sure you want it here,
so close to the road?

875
01:32:20,999 --> 01:32:23,919
We got all that space
back behind the house.

876
01:32:23,961 --> 01:32:26,922
Well, we can see her
right from the station...

877
01:32:26,964 --> 01:32:28,966
...keep our eye on her, you know?

878
01:32:30,968 --> 01:32:31,927
Out back...

879
01:32:31,969 --> 01:32:33,929
...there's all that space, you know.

880
01:32:33,971 --> 01:32:35,973
I mean, she could just disappear.

881
01:32:37,975 --> 01:32:38,934
No, you're right.

882
01:32:38,976 --> 01:32:39,977
You think?

883
01:32:40,978 --> 01:32:41,979
You're probably right.

884
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:43,981
I'll get that.

885
01:32:45,983 --> 01:32:47,985
Yeah, she's gonna love it.

886
01:33:26,982 --> 01:33:27,983
Mommy, I like this one.

887
01:33:28,984 --> 01:33:29,985
Yeah?

888
01:33:30,986 --> 01:33:32,946
Well, it's nice.

889
01:33:32,988 --> 01:33:34,990
Jerry, what do you think of this?

890
01:33:36,992 --> 01:33:37,993
Well, uh...

891
01:33:39,995 --> 01:33:40,954
...real nice.

892
01:33:40,996 --> 01:33:42,998
It's not really your taste, sugar.

893
01:33:43,999 --> 01:33:45,918
It is her color.

894
01:33:45,959 --> 01:33:47,961
- You like it?
- I like it.

895
01:33:48,962 --> 01:33:51,965
- Let's see how this looks to you.
- You like-- Oh, no.

896
01:33:52,966 --> 01:33:53,967
Come on, Tex.

897
01:34:08,982 --> 01:34:10,943
- You only have chocolate?
- Thank you.

898
01:34:10,984 --> 01:34:12,986
Let's have three of them.

899
01:34:17,991 --> 01:34:18,992
Did you see that?

900
01:34:31,964 --> 01:34:33,966
Isn't he at your school?

901
01:35:08,959 --> 01:35:11,920
"Thump, thump, thump. "

902
01:35:11,962 --> 01:35:14,923
"They heard the giant's footsteps.

903
01:35:14,965 --> 01:35:18,969
As quick as a wink, the lad
once again hid in the oven.

904
01:35:19,970 --> 01:35:24,975
In came the giant for the second time
and he bellowed, Fe.... "

905
01:35:25,976 --> 01:35:26,935
- "Fi."
- "Fo."

906
01:35:26,977 --> 01:35:27,978
- "Fum."
- "I...

907
01:35:28,979 --> 01:35:30,939
...smell the blood of an Englishman.

908
01:35:30,981 --> 01:35:34,943
Be he alive or be he dead...

909
01:35:34,985 --> 01:35:37,946
...I'll grind his bones...

910
01:35:37,988 --> 01:35:40,991
...to make my bread. "

911
01:35:47,998 --> 01:35:49,958
Here you are, $1 .50 is your change.

912
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:50,959
Here's your receipt.

913
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:53,962
Thanks for stopping by.

914
01:36:43,971 --> 01:36:44,930
Jerry.

915
01:36:44,972 --> 01:36:46,974
Look what Gary gave me.

916
01:36:50,978 --> 01:36:53,981
It's glow-in-the-dark so Jesus can
always be with me.

917
01:36:54,982 --> 01:36:56,942
Can you push me on the swings?

918
01:36:56,984 --> 01:37:01,947
Yeah. What did Mr. Jackson
want, Chrissy?

919
01:37:01,989 --> 01:37:06,994
He invited me to his church.
You think Mommy will let me go?

920
01:37:07,995 --> 01:37:09,955
Well, honey, you know...

921
01:37:09,997 --> 01:37:12,958
...a lot of people believe
a lot of different things.

922
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,920
Some people believe that the stories
in the Bible are real...

923
01:37:16,962 --> 01:37:22,926
...and some think they're like fairy
tales where the giants aren't real.

924
01:37:22,968 --> 01:37:25,971
Chrissy, I want you
to promise me something.

925
01:37:26,972 --> 01:37:29,933
When anybody tries
to talk to you, any man...

926
01:37:29,975 --> 01:37:33,937
...whether it's Mr. Jackson or not...

927
01:37:33,979 --> 01:37:36,940
...especially if it's a big,
tall man...

928
01:37:36,982 --> 01:37:38,942
...I want you to tell me, all right?

929
01:37:38,984 --> 01:37:40,944
Promise me that you'll tell.

930
01:37:40,986 --> 01:37:42,946
I promise.

931
01:37:42,988 --> 01:37:43,947
All right, honey.

932
01:37:43,989 --> 01:37:46,992
Could you push me on the swings now?

933
01:37:47,993 --> 01:37:50,996
Yeah. All right.
Give me your tootsies.

934
01:37:51,997 --> 01:37:52,998
Here we go.

935
01:38:24,988 --> 01:38:25,989
Lori.

936
01:38:27,991 --> 01:38:28,992
Oh, wow.

937
01:38:29,993 --> 01:38:31,954
Hold the roast. Let's eat these.

938
01:38:31,995 --> 01:38:35,999
- Let me clean the sink for you.
- Where's Chrissy? I want her to see--

939
01:38:36,959 --> 01:38:40,963
Oh, she's not here. The Jacksons
came over to take her to church.

940
01:38:41,964 --> 01:38:42,923
- Who?
- Put those in there.

941
01:38:42,965 --> 01:38:46,927
- You know, that Bless the Children--
- You let Jackson-- Oh, Jesus.

942
01:38:46,969 --> 01:38:47,928
What?

943
01:38:47,970 --> 01:38:50,931
- What? Jerry.
- No, I--

944
01:38:50,973 --> 01:38:53,934
I told her I'd go to church with her.

945
01:38:53,976 --> 01:38:56,937
I'm gonna try to find them.

946
01:38:56,979 --> 01:38:58,981
For God's sakes, it's just church.

947
01:39:18,959 --> 01:39:20,961
You're gonna give yourself
a heart attack.

948
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:02,961
Come on.

949
01:41:09,987 --> 01:41:11,989
Oh, God, no.

950
01:41:29,965 --> 01:41:31,967
Welcome to the House of Our Lord.

951
01:41:32,968 --> 01:41:34,928
May Jesus be with you.

952
01:41:34,970 --> 01:41:36,972
May Jesus be with you.

953
01:43:48,979 --> 01:43:49,980
Jerry!

954
01:43:50,981 --> 01:43:52,983
Jerry.

955
01:43:54,985 --> 01:43:56,945
Yes, hon. What is it?

956
01:43:56,987 --> 01:43:59,990
I can't sleep.
Could you read me a story?

957
01:44:02,993 --> 01:44:03,994
Another story?

958
01:44:04,995 --> 01:44:05,996
Please?

959
01:44:06,997 --> 01:44:07,998
Well, all right.

960
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,961
But just a short one. Scoot over.

961
01:44:13,962 --> 01:44:15,964
Let's see what we got here.

962
01:44:17,966 --> 01:44:18,926
We've got...

963
01:44:18,967 --> 01:44:20,969
..."The Elves and the Shoemaker."

964
01:44:21,970 --> 01:44:23,972
- We've got--
- I met The Wizard today.

965
01:44:27,976 --> 01:44:28,936
What?

966
01:44:28,977 --> 01:44:32,940
I had to promise not to tell
my parents. So you can't...

967
01:44:32,981 --> 01:44:36,985
...tell Mommy or he'll be very angry
at me and never come back again.

968
01:44:37,986 --> 01:44:39,947
Well, Chrissy, I...

969
01:44:39,988 --> 01:44:41,949
...I don't believe you.

970
01:44:41,990 --> 01:44:43,992
Wizards don't exist.

971
01:44:44,993 --> 01:44:47,996
No, Jerry, you're wrong.
And I can prove it.

972
01:44:48,997 --> 01:44:49,998
You can, huh?

973
01:44:57,965 --> 01:44:59,925
He gave me these.

974
01:44:59,967 --> 01:45:01,969
They're yummy.

975
01:45:04,972 --> 01:45:06,974
But you can't have them, Jerry.

976
01:45:07,975 --> 01:45:09,977
He said he'd give me more tomorrow.

977
01:45:10,978 --> 01:45:12,980
Tomorrow?

978
01:45:13,981 --> 01:45:14,982
Where?

979
01:45:16,984 --> 01:45:19,945
At the picnic grounds.
Aren't they cute?

980
01:45:19,987 --> 01:45:23,949
My itty-bitty, baby porcupines.

981
01:45:23,991 --> 01:45:27,995
The Wizard said they come
from a land far, far away.

982
01:45:28,996 --> 01:45:33,000
Jerry, can I go see
The Wizard tomorrow?

983
01:45:33,959 --> 01:45:37,921
Well, he seems like such
a nice wizard.

984
01:45:37,963 --> 01:45:40,966
I don't see why not.

985
01:45:42,968 --> 01:45:44,970
But let's keep this our secret.

986
01:45:46,972 --> 01:45:47,973
Thank you, Jerry.

987
01:47:30,993 --> 01:47:31,952
Strom, how is your position?

988
01:47:31,994 --> 01:47:34,997
I'm in position across the river.

989
01:47:35,998 --> 01:47:39,960
We have a clear view of the girl
at the picnic ground.

990
01:47:42,963 --> 01:47:44,923
You're out of position.

991
01:47:44,965 --> 01:47:46,967
- What?
- You should be over closer.

992
01:47:47,968 --> 01:47:50,971
Jerry, we got a whole SWAT team out
here doing you a big favor.

993
01:47:51,972 --> 01:47:52,973
Just stay where you are.

994
01:47:56,977 --> 01:47:58,979
Snipers, recheck your fields of fire.

995
01:48:27,966 --> 01:48:29,968
- Jerry?
- He's coming.

996
01:48:31,970 --> 01:48:32,971
What's the matter?

997
01:48:33,972 --> 01:48:34,973
I'm fine, Stan.

998
01:48:36,975 --> 01:48:38,977
Want some tea?

999
01:48:39,978 --> 01:48:42,981
You're very thirsty today, aren't you?

1000
01:48:48,987 --> 01:48:49,988
Oliver.

1001
01:48:53,992 --> 01:48:54,993
Oliver.

1002
01:48:59,998 --> 01:49:01,959
Where did you hide them chocolates?

1003
01:49:07,965 --> 01:49:10,968
Oh, there's some porcupines.

1004
01:49:11,969 --> 01:49:13,971
I'm just gonna go down
to the water for a minute.

1005
01:49:27,985 --> 01:49:29,987
Is this guy really coming?

1006
01:50:50,984 --> 01:50:52,945
Jerry's coming towards you now.

1007
01:50:52,986 --> 01:50:56,990
- I got him. What the hell's he doing?
- Jesus Christ, I have no idea.

1008
01:50:57,991 --> 01:50:58,951
This may have been a mistake.

1009
01:50:58,992 --> 01:51:00,994
Hold him, I'll be right there.

1010
01:51:01,995 --> 01:51:04,957
He had big, big eggs and....

1011
01:51:04,998 --> 01:51:08,961
So he went up to the eggs,
and it started shaking.

1012
01:51:25,978 --> 01:51:26,937
I don't know.

1013
01:51:26,979 --> 01:51:27,980
What's going on?

1014
01:51:30,983 --> 01:51:33,986
- Jerry?
- Okay, guys. Hold your positions.

1015
01:51:40,993 --> 01:51:42,953
We're out of position.

1016
01:51:42,995 --> 01:51:47,958
Jerry, I got eight guys out here,
hung up, doing you a big favor.

1017
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,961
You don't know what you're fucking
dealing with here.

1018
01:51:51,962 --> 01:51:54,923
You understand? You don't know
what you're dealing with here.

1019
01:51:54,965 --> 01:51:57,926
This guy is real, and I know it.

1020
01:51:57,968 --> 01:51:59,970
There's no Wizard, Jerry.

1021
01:52:00,971 --> 01:52:03,932
We got our man a year and a half ago.
Toby Wadenah.

1022
01:52:03,974 --> 01:52:06,977
You're making this real
difficult for me.

1023
01:52:08,979 --> 01:52:09,980
What, Stan?

1024
01:52:14,985 --> 01:52:15,986
We're calling it quits.

1025
01:52:16,987 --> 01:52:17,988
We're out of here.

1026
01:52:19,990 --> 01:52:22,993
It's over. That's it.

1027
01:52:23,994 --> 01:52:24,995
Okay, Stan.

1028
01:52:26,997 --> 01:52:28,957
You do what you gotta do.

1029
01:52:28,999 --> 01:52:31,960
I'll do what I gotta do.

1030
01:52:33,962 --> 01:52:38,967
Just when you leave,
don't compromise this operation.

1031
01:52:39,968 --> 01:52:41,970
You understand me?

1032
01:52:49,978 --> 01:52:50,979
Come on.

1033
01:52:51,980 --> 01:52:53,982
He's staying, so do your best
not to engage the girl.

1034
01:52:54,983 --> 01:52:56,985
Okay, guys. We are pulling out.

1035
01:52:58,987 --> 01:53:00,989
I want you to know
I have to tell the mother.

1036
01:53:49,997 --> 01:53:51,999
You should've known Jerry 20
years ago.

1037
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:53,917
He was a good cop.

1038
01:53:53,959 --> 01:53:54,960
He was a great cop.

1039
01:53:58,964 --> 01:54:00,966
Just, it's....

1040
01:54:01,967 --> 01:54:02,968
It's just sad.

1041
01:54:05,971 --> 01:54:07,973
He's become a drunk and a clown.

1042
01:54:17,983 --> 01:54:18,984
Fucking clown.

1043
01:54:44,968 --> 01:54:45,969
Chrissy.

1044
01:54:50,974 --> 01:54:51,975
Oh, my God, baby.

1045
01:54:52,976 --> 01:54:53,977
Oh, my God.

1046
01:54:54,978 --> 01:54:57,940
- Mommy, no.
- No, let's go. No.

1047
01:54:57,981 --> 01:54:59,983
No, Mommy.

1048
01:55:00,984 --> 01:55:01,944
Chrissy, stop it. Let's go.

1049
01:55:01,985 --> 01:55:02,986
Jerry.

1050
01:55:05,989 --> 01:55:07,950
- Get in the car.
- I want my doll--

1051
01:55:07,991 --> 01:55:09,993
Damn it, go.

1052
01:55:12,996 --> 01:55:14,957
Get in the car, now.

1053
01:55:14,998 --> 01:55:15,958
I want my bike.

1054
01:55:15,999 --> 01:55:16,959
Get in the car.

1055
01:55:24,967 --> 01:55:26,969
You fucking bastard, Jerry.

1056
01:55:31,974 --> 01:55:33,976
How could you do it to Chrissy?

1057
01:55:35,978 --> 01:55:37,980
Why would you do it to her?

1058
01:55:39,982 --> 01:55:41,984
She's 8 years old, Jerry.

1059
01:55:42,985 --> 01:55:44,987
She's only 8 years old.

1060
01:55:46,989 --> 01:55:48,991
She could have been killed.

1061
01:55:50,993 --> 01:55:51,994
Fucking...

1062
01:55:52,995 --> 01:55:53,996
...bastard.

1063
01:55:54,997 --> 01:55:55,998
Fucking crazy.

1064
01:55:58,959 --> 01:56:00,961
Why were you pretending...

1065
01:56:02,963 --> 01:56:06,967
...that you loved her and we were
starting this life together?

1066
01:56:11,972 --> 01:56:12,973
Fucking bastard.

1067
01:56:22,983 --> 01:56:24,985
You're fucking crazy.

1068
01:56:55,974 --> 01:56:59,978
Oh, boy. This was a bad one.

1069
01:57:10,989 --> 01:57:12,991
Jesus.

1070
01:57:13,992 --> 01:57:14,993
Poor bastard.

1071
01:57:46,984 --> 01:57:48,944
He's coming.

1072
01:57:48,986 --> 01:57:50,988
He's coming.

1073
01:57:52,990 --> 01:57:54,992
He's coming.

1074
01:57:55,993 --> 01:57:56,994
He's coming.

1075
01:57:57,995 --> 01:57:59,997
I know it.

1076
01:58:00,998 --> 01:58:03,000
I know it.

1077
01:59:32,965 --> 01:59:33,966
She said it.

1078
01:59:34,967 --> 01:59:36,969
She said it.

1079
01:59:36,969 --> 01:59:40,097
She did.
