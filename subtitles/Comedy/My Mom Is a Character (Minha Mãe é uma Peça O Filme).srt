1
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,680
(Episode 110)

2
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,410
Why are you all here?

3
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,880
We all have something to say to you.

4
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,610
Take a seat, Mr Kim.

5
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,180
Sit.

6
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,550
What is...

7
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,810
going on?

8
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,180
You.

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,810
You still don't remember what you told me when you were drunk, do you?

10
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,050
What did I say?

11
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,480
I can't say this...

12
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,550
because I'm scared. Jae Min, tell him.

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,710
I heard you are including...

14
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,550
the premium exhibition hall as a part of Chinese tourist course.

15
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,610
Did I say that?

16
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,610
You told me this when you were drunk.

17
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,750
How much money were you promised from SS Global for doing that?

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,550
What are you talking about?

19
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,550
I have nothing to do with them.

20
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,150
You're taking money from them as I have.

21
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,480
Do you have evidence?

22
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,650
Do you have any evidence that I have anything to do with that company?

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,580
You must work there, too.

24
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,750
I don't.

25
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,910
I just gave them my name.

26
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,980
This is a huge crime.

27
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,510
Just use the money.

28
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,210
My gosh.

29
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,780
When did she record this?

30
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,250
I don't think that is what's important now.

31
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,880
This recording proves my mum's innocence.

32
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,450
I am not afraid any more.

33
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to whistle-blow.

34
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,880
Will you join me...

35
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,180
or will you do your own thing?

36
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,810
Make a wise decision.

37
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,480
What will you get out of this?

38
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,980
I'll at least get my conscience back.

39
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,080
You never cared about your conscience.

40
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,650
Once she speaks up,

41
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,810
you'll undergo an investigation.

42
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,710
Just admit to your wrongdoing...

43
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,750
and side with us on disclosing Mr Oh's corruption.

44
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,480
We'll give you the weekend to think.

45
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,450
Let us know if you change your mind.

46
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,910
You all are making a fool out of me.

47
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,280
We're giving you a chance.

48
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,950
It's your last chance.

49
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,050
My goodness.

50
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,180
Did I really say that?

51
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,410
Hey.

52
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,450
I've never been this nervous before.

53
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,550
Why do we have to lie to make this happen?

54
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,110
Also,

55
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,880
what's this story about the Chinese tourist course?

56
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,150
That's not a lie.

57
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,050
My brother-in-law heard it.

58
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,850
- Il Mok did? - Where at?

59
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,810
At his part-time job as a server.

60
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,150
He heard Mr Oh and Mr Kim talk about that a while ago.

61
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,710
That's why Mr Oh was determined to get you so badly.

62
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,980
If we establish the on-site day care centre,

63
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,950
his source of side money will be gone for good.

64
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,410
Will Mr Kim...

65
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,880
take our side?

66
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,780
He now knows that we know of his secret.

67
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,680
There is nothing else he can do other than siding with us.

68
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,450
I really hope he does.

69
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,350
Will you be okay?

70
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,680
Of course. I'll find a part-time job.

71
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,380
You don't need a part-time job.

72
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,080
Even if you do get another job, do it after you give birth.

73
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,310
It'll be too hard for you.

74
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,550
Many pregnant women work until right before they are due.

75
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,880
You did that.

76
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,980
They won't let this pass.

77
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,180
What are the choices I have?

78
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,650
Yes.

79
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,480
That's the only way.

80
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,480
- Excuse me, I have a question. - Yes, welcome.

81
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,680
I want to work here.

82
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,850
Who can I talk to?

83
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,150
There's an office down the aisle.

84
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,980
Thanks.

85
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,550
I'm so sorry to ask,

86
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,980
but what's the hourly wage?

87
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,550
Honey.

88
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
Hey, Honey.

89
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,980
What are you doing here?

90
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,880
I'm looking for a part-time job.

91
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,150
You know what?

92
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,110
I saw Rita drinking by himself on my way here.

93
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,610
What happened?

94
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,350
We took our last shot with Dung Kim today.

95
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,480
I see.

96
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,750
I think I will be...

97
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,150
whistle-blowing soon.

98
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,750
You don't need to look for a part-time job already.

99
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,410
You know that I have to be prepared for everything.

100
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,810
I have to do something before I find another job.

101
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,780
If I never land a full-time job,

102
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,850
I'll start a small business.

103
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,210
If we take out a business loan to open up a small shop,

104
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,310
I'm sure we won't starve.

105
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,580
This is really sad.

106
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,480
You're a great cook.

107
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,110
And I'm adorable.

108
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,110
We'll get so many customers.

109
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,680
Adorable?

110
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,780
You're right. I'll do my best and...

111
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,350
Why, what is it?

112
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,550
- Sky just moved. - What?

113
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,580
Was that a kick?

114
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,780
Sky's more powerful than Min Ho.

115
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,050
I was really surprised.

116
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,150
Min Ho?

117
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,710
Wow.

118
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,250
All right.

119
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,910
We have nothing to worry about thanks to our dear Sky.

120
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,550
- Of course. - Yes, of course.

121
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,350
Let's go!

122
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,250
- Go. - Go!

123
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,350
Min Ho, are you having fun? We're here.

124
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,380
- You're here. - Yes.

125
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,710
- Here. - What's this?

126
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,610
Jae Min, cook for us.

127
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,110
We got ingredients for curry.

128
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,150
My goodness. Listen to her.

129
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,250
I really don't want to cook tonight.

130
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,880
Do you ever cook?

131
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,310
Stop it, Jae Min.

132
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,950
I cook when I want to.

133
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,450
I feel bad for people who don't have a younger sister-in-law.

134
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,380
I'm that man!

135
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,880
Don't worry, brother-in-law. You've got me, the beautiful one.

136
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,410
Of course, Mi So.

137
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,410
Mum.

138
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,880
I think Eun Sol likes Min Ho.

139
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,380
- Really? - Really?

140
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,210
What did she say?

141
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,950
She said this today.

142
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,410
What did she say?

143
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,780
- What? - What did she say?

144
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,650
- Why are you smiling? - What happened?

145
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,910
What happened with Eun Sol?

146
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,210
What about her?

147
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,750
How many jump ropes can you do?

148
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,380
I'm not sure.

149
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,110
I can do more than 10.

150
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,110
Really?

151
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,210
Jump like this.

152
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,310
Cross it over like this.

153
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,850
Bang Geul, wait for me.

154
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,480
No!

155
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,610
Eun Sol.

156
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,780
Be careful.

157
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,250
Are you okay, Eun Sol?

158
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,450
Min Ho is so cool.

159
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,650
Min Ho, that's great! Give me a high-five.

160
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,050
- That's great news. - Congratulations, Min Ho.

161
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,480
No, wait.

162
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,080
Let's not get all too excited.

163
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,380
She's right. We can't be excited at this stage.

164
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,480
Right?

165
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,350
Bang Geul, how did her face look when she said...

166
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,880
she liked Min Ho?

167
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,650
"Min Ho is..."

168
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,850
"so cool."

169
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,880
We did it, Ye Eun.

170
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,250
Congratulations, Min Ho.

171
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,480
Does Eun Sol like me?

172
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,150
Yes. Didn't you catch Bang Geul's face?

173
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,310
No woman makes that face about someone she doesn't like.

174
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,550
- Yes. She's right. - Yes!

175
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,250
Was there something special about how Bang Geul looked?

176
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,250
I'm not sure. She mostly looked hungry to me.

177
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,850
- What? - What?

178
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,450
I thought she looked hungry, too.

179
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,550
Aren't you hungry, Ga Ram?

180
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,150
Honey.

181
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,150
Take these.

182
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,950
Do you want me to set tables now?

183
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,480
Would you want...

184
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,720
Eun Sol's husband to sit around while she prepares food?

185
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,080
I wouldn't want that.

186
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,720
Eun Sol, will you take the chopsticks and spoons?

187
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,550
Be careful.

188
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,010
Eun Sol.

189
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
Park Eun Sol.

190
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,050
Yes, what?

191
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,980
Take the chopsticks and spoons.

192
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,180
Okay.

193
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,080
Eun Sol, what's on your mind?

194
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,780
Nothing.

195
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,650
Aren't you going to bed yet?

196
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,210
Mum, which one is prettier?

197
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,980
Both.

198
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,080
But still. Pick one for me.

199
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,950
- This one. - Okay. I'll wear this tomorrow.

200
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,580
To where?

201
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,010
We're going to play together at the playground.

202
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,910
- Will Min Ho be there? - Yes.

203
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,450
Good for you, Eun Sol.

204
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,310
Yes.

205
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:25,950
What is it?

206
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,080
Honey, it seems like Eun Sol likes Min Ho, too.

207
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,480
What? Wait.

208
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,610
She liked Woo Seong.

209
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:37,050
Min Ho must have done something very impressive.

210
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,810
She's choosing clothes for tomorrow...

211
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,480
to look pretty for Min Ho.

212
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,550
This isn't good.

213
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,780
Don't girls need a bit of attitude when it comes to relationships?

214
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,680
It's not like they're getting married.

215
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,010
Why the attitude?

216
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,410
No, this isn't good.

217
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,710
I'll teach Eun Sol about relationships.

218
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,050
My goodness.

219
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,210
(Bukhansan Restaurant)

220
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,110
We don't have enough side dishes.

221
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,980
Professor, Professor.

222
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,450
Those two are back.

223
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,480
- Really? - Yes.

224
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,780
Do you want me to take these?

225
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,350
Yes. Thanks for your help.

226
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,750
- Yes, Sir. - Sure.

227
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,810
- Hello. - Hello.

228
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,880
Menu, please.

229
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,550
Welcome. Sure.

230
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,410
What do you want to tell me?

231
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,780
Ms Joo is determined...

232
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,950
to whistle-blow.

233
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,480
Why haven't you stopped her?

234
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,310
They are all siding together.

235
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,210
I couldn't do anything.

236
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,080
Who do you mean?

237
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,950
Ms Lee and Ms Joo turned out to be sisters.

238
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,050
Really?

239
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:21,250
That's why Jae Min has been picking a fight with me.

240
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,050
Anyway.

241
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,610
You are not affiliated with SS Global on papers,

242
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,310
so the disciplinary committee won't bring you in.

243
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,310
But that's not the case for me. I may get fired.

244
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,150
You have to let me at least make a living.

245
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,810
Of course.

246
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,810
I'll give you something.

247
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,610
Thank you, Mr Oh.

248
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,150
Even if a disciplinary committee is held,

249
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,280
I will keep my mouth shut.

250
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,150
Thank you.

251
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,780
Instead, I'll make sure your punishment is...

252
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,950
minimised.

253
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,550
Thank you. Let's eat.

254
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,880
So Rita asked for money.

255
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,610
Hey, that guy is leaving.

256
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,810
Is he?

257
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,710
Yes. It's just as I expected.

258
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,180
Think of this as a small investment.

259
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,280
Think about our future.

260
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,650
It's a great chance for us to get rid of Mr Kim, too.

261
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,410
I'm glad he asked for money from his end.

262
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,480
Yes.

263
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,810
Jae Min, let's sit.

264
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,480
What happened?

265
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,610
Rita asked Mr Oh for money...

266
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,310
for keeping his mouth shut in front of the disciplinary committee.

267
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,310
So he won't side with us.

268
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,150
But Mr Oh said something strange.

269
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,480
What do you mean?

270
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,480
I heard him talk on his phone in front of the restaurant.

271
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,050
He's glad Rita asked for money...

272
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,580
and that he can get rid of him as well.

273
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,610
Is he glad that he asked for money?

274
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,480
What is he thinking?

275
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,180
He wouldn't mention who was on the other side.

276
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,480
I was hoping to hear that.

277
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,550
I need to meet Dung Kim on Monday.

278
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
- Dad. - Uncle.

279
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,110
- Let's go to the playground. - Let's go.

280
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,910
We're meeting Yu Ra and Eun Sol there.

281
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,010
Shall we go?

282
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,650
- You're here. - Hello.

283
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,450
Oh, my.

284
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,950
- Hi, Eun Sol. - Hello.

285
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:38,950
Hello.

286
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,950
Hi, Min Ho.

287
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,880
Hi.

288
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,950
Go on, Eun Sol.

289
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,950
I want to ride it, too.

290
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,450
Wait.

291
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,850
Bang Geul and I are riding this right now.

292
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,280
Okay.

293
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,280
Wow, look at how chic Min Ho is.

294
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,610
Yes.

295
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,550
That must be my blood.

296
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,850
Eun Sol.

297
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,180
Remember what I said.

298
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,050
Do not forget what I have just told you.

299
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,750
All right.

300
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,180
Eun Sol.

301
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,980
You can't let Min Ho know that you like him. Okay?

302
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,550
No. I want to tell him that I like him.

303
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,680
Eun Sol.

304
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,350
You ruined everything!

305
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,610
Eun Sol!

306
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,180
This is a historical moment.

307
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,050
It is. I'm a little dumbfounded myself.

308
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,380
My goodness.

309
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,420
Hey.

310
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,710
- It's a bee. - You're adorable.

311
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,280
- She's adorable. - This is a bee.

312
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,480
It'll be difficult to persuade Sang Gu and Yu Ra's mums, right?

313
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,080
It won't be easy.

314
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,680
They think of shared babysitting centre...

315
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,610
as an academy.

316
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,010
I understand. Their kids are all grown up.

317
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,420
They wouldn't want to take a part in a day care centre with infants.

318
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,050
I'm sure dads can't convince them.

319
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,180
We should be there on the next meeting.

320
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,710
Sure.

321
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:48,250
Wouldn't it be hard for Ms Joo? She's almost due.

322
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,980
Yes. You can send Il Mok instead.

323
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,650
I'm doing fine.

324
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,180
It looks like your stomach does not get bloated up.

325
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,950
- Right. - Mine bloated after six months.

326
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,380
I suddenly got so huge.

327
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,280
Did you give Min Ho a natural birth?

328
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,610
You know what? Min Ho weighed 3.8kg.

329
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:08,450
- That must've been hard. - That sounds painful.

330
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,180
Eun Sol weighed 3.1kg.

331
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,880
Bang Geul weighed 3.3kg.

332
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,480
Excuse me.

333
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,280
If you're going to talk about that, you should just go to a cafe.

334
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,150
It's a bit awkward for me.

335
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,150
What's awkward about pregnancy? You were born from a woman too.

336
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,980
Why are you eating instant noodles instead of a proper meal?

337
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,050
I was too lazy.

338
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,080
Did you all see Lee Min Ho advertising a rice cooker?

339
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,750
He even set out the whole table. How considerate!

340
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,880
Right, that was so awesome.

341
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,680
Wouldn't it be so awesome...

342
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,310
if a guy like that sets out a table for me?

343
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,150
- She's so excited already. - I can eat...

344
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,480
at least 10 servings.

345
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,150
I want to serve those 10 servings to Lee Min Ho myself.

346
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,580
I'll eat those 10 servings sitting next to him.

347
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,920
- Next to him? - Yes.

348
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,050
I'd face him.

349
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,280
- I said, "Are you leaving?" - Good job.

350
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,210
Wait.

351
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,350
- What's with him? - I don't know.

352
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,080
It must be something good.

353
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,280
- Let's go. - Okay.

354
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,920
He didn't have to give me this much.

355
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,250
I should make a move now.

356
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,650
I'm home.

357
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,350
- You're back, Mi So. - Yes.

358
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,450
Mum, Eun Sol told Min Ho that she likes him today.

359
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,550
Really?

360
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,080
- What happened? - Eun Sol...

361
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,680
- Yes? - My goodness.

362
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,680
Ga Ram, come to me.

363
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,420
Come.

364
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,280
- It's Dung Kim. - What?

365
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,480
- Hello? - I decided to go with you.

366
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,180
Will you whistle-blow with us?

367
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,780
Yes, I will.

368
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,810
Tell Ms Joo to get started on Monday.

369
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,010
I don't think I can step up.

370
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,420
Okay. I'll see you on Monday.

371
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,110
Dung Kim says he's going to take our side.

372
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,080
I just saw him sitting in front of a store.

373
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,080
He looked really happy.

374
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,480
- Why is he happy? - I don't know.

375
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,380
He must have gotten the money.

376
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,310
What money?

377
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,180
He asked Mr Oh for money...

378
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,750
for keeping his mouth shut.

379
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,610
Why is he suddenly siding with us?

380
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,310
This is...

381
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,750
fishy.

382
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,380
Right?

383
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,810
Why haven't I heard from the kids?

384
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,250
Did something happen?

385
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,150
I hope everything is okay.

386
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,910
What should I do?

387
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,150
I promised her that we wouldn't visit them.

388
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,150
I can't visit them because Ms Lee's watching.

389
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,550
Why am I so itchy?

390
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:26,210
Ms Ok, I'm going to go to a bath house.

391
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,650
You should go and relieve your stress.

392
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,650
You've been working hard here.

393
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,710
Oh, sure.

394
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,310
I might be late.

395
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,110
Don't wait for me.

396
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,050
- Don't worry. - Sure.

397
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,110
Goodbye. Goodnight.

398
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,450
I won't let this pass.

399
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,680
Hey.

400
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,180
- Hey, Ms Lee. - Oh, my.

401
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,110
Ms Ok.

402
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,410
What are you doing here?

403
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,750
Why are you here?

404
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,580
My goodness. We should've just come together.

405
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,050
You're right.

406
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,610
Let's go.

407
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,080
- Let's go. - Come on, guys.

408
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,580
- Mum. - Mum.

409
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,910
Where are you guys going?

410
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,610
We wanted to get some fried chicken.

411
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,550
We had something to discuss.

412
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,880
My goodness.

413
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:37,410
You don't have the time to call in and tell us about what's going on,

414
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,110
but you have the time to eat fried chicken.

415
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,850
Well, we've been a bit busy.

416
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:45,550
We were really worried about you. You guys are awful.

417
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,210
- I'm sorry. - We were wrong.

418
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,550
You can all go ahead. We're leaving.

419
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,910
Let's go, Ms Ok.

420
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,010
- Come with us. - Let's go.

421
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,480
You guys can go.

422
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,480
- No, let's go. - I don't want to eat.

423
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,050
Let's go.

424
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,210
My goodness.

425
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,480
Bang Geul, eat up.

426
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,850
Min Ho, eat.

427
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,110
Okay.

428
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,080
We were wrong.

429
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,450
- Don't be angry. - Let's eat.

430
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,610
You should eat some.

431
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:21,910
I decided...

432
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,280
to tell the company about my wrongdoings.

433
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,310
Mum. What did you do wrong?

434
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,310
I was really greedy.

435
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,310
I need to tell them that I'm sorry.

436
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,550
Don't worry about it.

437
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:45,110
She has Ms Ok, Ms Lee and us.

438
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,880
Things look promising thanks to your recording.

439
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,410
Really?

440
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,980
Yes. It's all thanks to you two.

441
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,480
This is so great.

442
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,410
Why didn't you tell us before?

443
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,480
We're sorry, Mum.

444
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,050
Let's eat, Ms Ok.

445
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,350
It looks like...

446
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,350
that recording really saved them.

447
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,250
This is great.

448
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,350
They said nothing will happen to Ye Eun now.

449
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,850
You can sleep well from today.

450
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,110
I will.

451
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,610
Recently, I could barely sleep.

452
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,180
My goodness.

453
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,350
Give me your back.

454
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,310
It's okay, Ms Ok.

455
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,610
We couldn't discuss anything with Ye Eun's family...

456
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,050
because of our mums.

457
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,380
We'll do it tomorrow.

458
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,850
We were too inattentive...

459
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,980
after they went through such a huge incident.

460
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,450
It's nothing hard to call them and talk to them about this.

461
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,380
You're right.

462
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,150
But I could see them lighten up...

463
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,410
when we said nothing will happen to Ye Eun.

464
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,380
I was...

465
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,310
a bit touched.

466
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,680
Nothing will happen. Let's just believe that.

467
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,610
I'm going to see a member of the disciplinary committee today.

468
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,080
You should wait.

469
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,680
Dung Kim said he'd help. Let's talk to him first.

470
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,680
I heard Dung Kim asked Mr Oh for money.

471
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,350
Why would he help me?

472
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,210
It's weird. That's why we want to see him.

473
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,350
Mi So will call him.

474
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,950
Mr Kim seems to be late.

475
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,110
You're right. I'm worried.

476
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,410
He has to come in soon.

477
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,910
Hello? Marketing Team One.

478
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,710
Yes, Mr Kwon. What's up?

479
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,210
What? What are you talking about?

480
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,680
Did you say Dung Kim quit? Why would he do that?

481
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,750
Did Mr Kim quit?

482
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,410
Did Dung Kim really quit?

483
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,310
(Working Mum Stay Home Dad)

484
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,710
I told you.

485
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,650
That small amount of money was an investment for our future.

486
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,310
They can't do anything without Mr Kim around.

487
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,610
Isn't this absurd?

488
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,410
He said he'd help, but he suddenly quit.

489
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,110
Mi So, let's go on a date.

490
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,780
A date?

491
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,480
I wanted to chat with you.

492
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,250
I'm sorry, Mi So.

493
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,750
I think I'll do something that will make you mad.

494
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,910
Ms Ok, if things go well,

495
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,810
- I think we can get Mr Kim. - Really?

496
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,180
What are you talking about?

497
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,850
Why did Ms Joo summon a disciplinary committee?
