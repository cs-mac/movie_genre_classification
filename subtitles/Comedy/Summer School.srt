1
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,030
Wondermutt, go get Bob.

2
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,270
Hey, guys! You all got
your grade cards, right?

3
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,870
OK.

4
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,610
What have we learned this year?

5
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,080
Teamwork, sportsmanship,
how your friends look naked.

6
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,090
You'll notice your
grade cards are blank.

7
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,950
Who better to evaluate a student's
progress than the student himself?

8
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,130
Good morning, young people.

9
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,730
Vice Principal Gills has
some words for you. Mr. Gills.

10
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,060
Thank you, Principal Kelban.

11
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,410
Well, well, I suppose you all remember
the English skills test last month.

12
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,980
- No.
- No.

13
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,200
- I had English?
- The dot-to-dot puzzle?

14
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,780
Yeah, that was it, yeah.
No, I don't remember.

15
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,610
I'm not surprised.
All of you failed.

16
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,850
However, in accordance with policies
on minimum academic proficiencies,

17
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,420
you'll have the opportunity
to retake the exam.

18
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,560
- Great.
- Oh, joy, I have a boner now.

19
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,660
- Hi. I'm all packed. Are you ready?
- One minute to go.

20
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,030
Your parents have been notified
you'll be retested after completing

21
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,140
the mandatory course in remedial
English. In summer school.

22
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,580
- What?
- We just finished a whole semester

23
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,410
and we gotta go
to summer school?

24
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,180
- You're crazy. I ain't going.
- My grandmother's gonna kill me.

25
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,290
Twenty, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15,

26
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,290
fourteen, 13, 12,

27
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,870
eleven, ten, nine, eight,

28
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,530
seven, six, five, four,

29
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,870
three, two, one!

30
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,690
I won! I won!

31
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,060
I won! I won!

32
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,030
Gills, Kelban. I did it, I did it.

33
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,470
Look at this puppy.
50,000 big ones.

34
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,610
Know what this means?
No summer school.

35
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,470
Wait, you gave me your word.

36
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,010
That was the old word.
My new one is "money".

37
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,240
You would let 50 grand weaken
your commitment to education?

38
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,420
Lesser men win millions,
go right back to busing tables!

39
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,680
They're frigging morons!

40
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,160
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!

41
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,960
Don't look at me.
You're in charge of summer school.

42
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,240
- May I speak with you a minute?
- Sure.

43
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,270
I need you to teach summer school.
Dearadorian just quit.

44
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,880
- Didn't he teach remedial English?
- Well, yes... Winnick!

45
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,680
Musway!

46
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,750
Stop! Stop!

47
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,390
Mary!

48
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,120
I have to talk to you.

49
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,590
Kim, get in the car.

50
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,830
It's OK. I'll meet you at the airport.
I'll get a cab. Take Wondermutt.

51
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,770
Shoop.

52
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,410
All right.

53
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,750
Mr. Shoop. Oh, Mr. Shoop.

54
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,490
Congratulations. You've been chosen
to teach summer school.

55
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,550
Shoot.

56
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,380
If only I'd known sooner.

57
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,220
- We're going to Hawaii.
- May I remind you, Mr. Shoop,

58
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,920
you're up for tenure.
You want a job next year?

59
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,100
Come on, Mr. Gills.
Look, we got leis on and everything.

60
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,270
You'll be teaching remedial English.

61
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,300
Remedial English?
Look, I ain't no English teacher.

62
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,530
See? Double negative.

63
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,370
No, I hand out basketballs, check for
jockstraps. I'm, like, very challenged.

64
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,850
- I'm not a real teacher.
- That's all right.

65
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,380
These aren't real students.
They're unmotivated, irresponsible.

66
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,220
- They'll relate to you.
- I appreciate that.

67
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,880
No, the reason I got into this whole
teaching gig was to get summers off.

68
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,090
No, I'm afraid my answer
has to be no.

69
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,090
No, thank you?

70
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,200
Bottom line, you need
my recommendation for tenure.

71
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,870
This is blackmail.

72
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,170
We call it school spirit.

73
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,950
Kim.

74
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,180
Have you ever seen
The Wizard of Oz?

75
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,050
- Oh, I love that movie.
- Yeah. Yeah, me too.

76
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,750
And my favorite part is when Dorothy,
she clicks her heels together

77
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,430
and she says,
"There's no place like home.

78
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,620
"There is no place like home."

79
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,990
Oh, Shoop, I understand.

80
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,670
You do? You're not disappointed?

81
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,710
No. I'll just go by myself.

82
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,740
- What, alone?
- I'll make friends.

83
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:27,510
Look, Kim, if you love me, even if you
just like me a lot, you won't do this.

84
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,350
If I didn't like you, I wouldn't ask you
to drive me to the airport, now would I?

85
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,390
Guess not.

86
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,530
You're in room 43.

87
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,420
Files on your students.

88
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,590
A word to the wise, Mr. Shoop:

89
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,200
Right off the bat,
you show them who's in charge.

90
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,700
Great.

91
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,170
Who is in charge?

92
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,600
Very cute.

93
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,010
Thanks. So are you.

94
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,780
Oh, you meant...

95
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,520
Jeez, I'm so embarrassed.
But you are cute.

96
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,680
I'm all right. I'm Robin Bishop.
I teach American history next door.

97
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,160
Hi, Freddy Shoop.
Remedial English, right here.

98
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,590
Everybody calls me Shoop.

99
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,460
OK, Shoop.

100
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,770
Why am I here? Oh, thumbtacks.
Could I borrow some?

101
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,170
Sure. I was just gonna get my
summer bulletin board going here.

102
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,600
Jackpot. Whole box.
Here you go, my treat.

103
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,800
- But what about your bulletin board?
- Oh, yeah. Give me one.

104
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,010
Remedial English, huh?

105
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,380
I got it easy, I have honor students.
They're here voluntarily.

106
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,220
- Believe it?
- No.

107
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,190
I've seen some of your students.

108
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,260
Very scary.
You must be a good teacher.

109
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,630
Shucks, Robin, I don't know.

110
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,230
Heck, inside every so-called
bad kid is a good kid

111
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,570
waiting for someone to reach down
through the sleaze and slime,

112
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,000
pick him up
and hose him off.

113
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:04,940
If we fail with even one child, we
might be losing the next Ted Koppel.

114
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,810
We're the unsung heroes
doing God's work.

115
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,680
You're not wearing
a wedding ring.

116
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,290
Yeah, my mother noticed that too.

117
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,620
So you're single. In love? Involved?
What's the story here?

118
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,520
The story is that I've been
seeing someone.

119
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:23,600
But we just started dating,
so you do what you think's right.

120
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,990
- OK.
- I better get going.

121
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,330
Well, here, I'll walk you.

122
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,170
So you're free to see
other people, then?

123
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,740
Are you asking me out?

124
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,640
- Well, if I was, would you say yes?
- I might.

125
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,440
Well, I might be asking you out.

126
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,670
- You like Chinese?
- I hate it.

127
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,280
Me too. I can't stand it.

128
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,350
Wanna go out and not eat Chinese?

129
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,820
I might.

130
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,350
Why don't we talk
about that after school.

131
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,160
I'm in love again.

132
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,460
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
The crowd goes mild.

133
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,930
- Hey, wow.
- Kevin?

134
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,300
- What happened to football, buddy?
- Yeah.

135
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,810
I was kicked off the team
for being stupid.

136
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,440
All right, it's about time.

137
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,340
Congratulations, bud.

138
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,880
Sorry I'm late.

139
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:23,960
Hey, Mr. Shoop, wow.
You in this class too?

140
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,690
- I'm teaching it.
- No way!

141
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,160
Party all the time
Party all the time

142
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,330
My girl likes to party all the time

143
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:36,200
All right, have a seat.
Let's see who the lucky winners are.

144
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,900
Larry Kazimias. Where's Larry?

145
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,780
He's nocturnal.

146
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,810
Oh, OK.

147
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,180
Try and keep it down.
Francis Gremp?

148
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,120
Don't ever call me that.
The name is Chainsaw.

149
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,450
- As in Black & Decker?
- As in Texas Massacre.

150
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,090
- Oh, yeah, that's in here.
- It's in there.

151
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,890
- They got files on us.
- Pam House.

152
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,290
Says here you lack concentration.

153
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,840
Pam?

154
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,070
Never mind.

155
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,910
Jerome Watkins.

156
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,580
Computer said
I failed that test.

157
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,280
The computer made an error.

158
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,320
I recommend this time, I pass.

159
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,160
You're gonna do well, Jerome.
I can feel it.

160
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,190
- Alan Eakian.
- Present, sir.

161
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,370
Four brothers, two sisters,
all straight-A students.

162
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,040
What are you doing here?

163
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,180
I assume there was some sort
of a baby mix-up at the hospital.

164
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,320
- Rhonda Altobello.
- Here.

165
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,010
You went from C's to F's.
What happened?

166
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,320
Any other questions?

167
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,320
No.

168
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,360
- Denise Green.
- What's that file say about me?

169
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,000
It's a lie. You wanna know about me,
ask me. What you want to know?

170
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,260
- Where are my car keys?
- How would I know?

171
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,940
What, does that thing say
I'm a thief too?

172
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,770
All right, where are my car keys?

173
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,350
- Chainsaw?
- Somewhere in this room.

174
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,020
Right now you're very cold.

175
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,160
- You're really cold.
- I want those keys.

176
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,520
Oh, God, you're freezing.

177
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,060
OK. OK, I'm a fun guy.
I'll play along.

178
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,560
- Getting warmer.
- You are getting hot, man.

179
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,100
- Oh, I see smoke.
- You are on fire!

180
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,640
Oh, you're walking on the sun!
Ouch! Oh, wait.

181
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,810
My mistake, I forgot where
I put them. You're ice-cold.

182
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,240
Enough of this shit.

183
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,440
Does that mean
we can swear in class?

184
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,170
- Shit, yes!
- Hey, watch your fucking language!

185
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,480
Watch your language, fart-face!

186
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,020
- Where are my keys?
- There's the dick-brain that knows.

187
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,020
If I knew anything,
would I be in this butt-hole class?

188
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,860
Suck my loggerhead.

189
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,390
Damn it!

190
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,060
- Jizzum-head!
- Jizzum-head. Yeah, good one.

191
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,570
One of my all-time faves.

192
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,730
Psychology.

193
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,400
You give a child the license
to swear, they lose all interest in it.

194
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,870
- I certainly did.
- You're full of bull.

195
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,550
It's OK, you can say "bullshit" in here.

196
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,980
I'm grateful.

197
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,670
I'm sure you're aware
that I'm teaching next door.

198
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,010
And this swearing
is getting a little loud.

199
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,850
You think you could concentrate on
some obscene gestures for a while?

200
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,390
Yes! Yes, that's the idea.

201
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,190
Thank you.

202
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,270
I don't think she likes you.

203
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,300
I want my car keys.

204
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,280
I'm using the lavatory.

205
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,780
- This is worse than a gas station.
- Yeah, I think I have to go too.

206
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,250
Wait a minute. Hey, wait a...
My keys.

207
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,390
Thattaboy, Mr. Shoop.

208
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,820
Hey. Hey!

209
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,400
OK, I'm calling roll
and then I'm gonna...

210
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,330
Where's my roll sheet?

211
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,640
It's somewhere in this room.

212
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,010
Hey. Sorry about the noise.

213
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,810
I'm really a gym teacher.
I don't belong in a classroom.

214
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,450
Apology accepted.

215
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,950
See you later.

216
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,690
Let's start all over.
Hi, I'm Freddy Shoop.

217
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,090
Look, you're a semi-charming guy
and a snappy dresser.

218
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,860
- You're not the kind of guy I date.
- Yeah? What kind are you dating?

219
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,040
- Oh, the kind who wears socks.
- I got a pair somewhere.

220
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,870
White ones. So about dinner,

221
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,140
you like Italian? Mexican?
Hey, maybe you'd rather cook.

222
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,970
I'm not having dinner with you.

223
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,510
- OK, lunch.
- Robin.

224
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,280
Excuse me just one second.

225
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,880
Robin, about tonight,
the concert starts at 8.

226
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,520
I thought we'd go to the beach
and have a picnic.

227
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,890
- Watch the sunset.
- Sounds wonderful.

228
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,820
Oh, bye-bye, Freddy.

229
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,700
I'll be darned.
You're a heterosexual.

230
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,730
And a damned good one.

231
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,340
- Good luck, honey.
- Thanks, Mom.

232
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,770
OK, start her up.

233
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,680
Make a right, please.

234
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,790
These photos suck.

235
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,220
Weddings, graduations.

236
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,660
- Hoffman came in.
- Yeah.

237
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,130
It's more of the redhead
with the tattoo.

238
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:12,030
This time he's got her making
breakfast stark raving naked.

239
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,870
Oh, Hoffman, you're so sick.

240
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,410
Check out this composition.

241
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:20,740
Round English muffin, square butter,
triangular bush. The man is an artist.

242
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,850
- Reprints.
- Reprints.

243
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,450
Hi, I'd like to sign
up for Lamaze classes.

244
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,250
OK, how are Tuesday nights
for you and your coach?

245
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,020
- Perfect, but I don't have a coach.
- Well, what about the father?

246
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,190
Well, that's sort of confusing. It's either
David Lee Roth, who's on tour,

247
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,230
or Sean Penn. And I'd really hate
to upset Madonna.

248
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,230
Fill this out.

249
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,610
OK. How far did we get yesterday?

250
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,540
You took roll.

251
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,340
Right. That shouldn't
take as long today.

252
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,250
Pam.

253
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,650
- Mr. Shoop, I gotta book.
- What? You just got here.

254
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,230
Yeah.

255
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,130
- It's a female thing.
- Oh, yeah, I understand.

256
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,840
Oh, man, she's going surfing!

257
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm sure.

258
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:24,840
Fuck. This menstruation deal,
it's such a scam.

259
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,540
Girls are so lucky.

260
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,010
What? Oh, we're so lucky?

261
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,580
You think being on your period
is some picnic? Are you crazy?

262
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:36,020
You get PMS, there's no room
in your purse for no hairbrush

263
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,850
because you got these mini pads.

264
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,290
You are so ignorant!

265
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,730
This whole class
is jammed with ignorance.

266
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,870
Yes, it is. Come in here, please.

267
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,900
Mr. Shoop, this is our new
foreign exchange student,

268
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,330
Anna-Maria Mazarelli.

269
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,940
Anna-Maria is from Milan, Italy.

270
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,600
She would like to brush up her English
skills before the fall semester begins.

271
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,450
Well, I'll let you return
to your rigorous pursuit

272
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,880
of academic excellence.

273
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,310
Please.

274
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:09,380
Anna-Maria, welcome to America.
You can sit wherever you want.

275
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,220
You looking for a seat?

276
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,390
Well, now, this desk
appears to be unoccupied.

277
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,930
Grazie.

278
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,300
OK, let's see what we got here.

279
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,450
"Rules of grammar."

280
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,810
"Writing paragraphs."

281
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,310
God, I hate this stuff.

282
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,460
"Book reports."

283
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,880
Wanna get out of here?
Go to the library?

284
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,320
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

285
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,720
Let's go.

286
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,830
I am Chainsaw.

287
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,330
Hi, Chainsaw.

288
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,870
- Hi, I'm Dave.
- Ciao.

289
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,790
- Well, we love Italy.
- Yeah.

290
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,840
- The pizza.
- Mussolini.

291
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,470
- And Tony Bennett.
- The Mafia.

292
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,010
Yeah. Chef Boyardee.

293
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,270
- Pinocchio.
- Fellatio.

294
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,470
Oh, I don't like that.

295
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,670
- Well, have you ever tried it?
- Sure.

296
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,580
Chef Boyardee, spaghetti in a can.
It's so mushy.

297
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,530
Anna-Maria?

298
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,190
Have you seen the movie
Texas Chainsaw Massacre?

299
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,270
No. It is good?

300
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,440
Oh, I gotta tell you,
I love this film.

301
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,170
It had passion and a plucky spirit.

302
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,210
And the characters had integrity.

303
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,350
Like when Leatherface went
on a strict diet of human flesh.

304
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,380
- He had to cut out chicken and fish.
- I agree with you.

305
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,540
I'll go a step further. Leatherface
wore a mask made out of human skin,

306
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,320
he hung people on meat hooks,
but we've all got quirks.

307
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,960
I've got them. You got them.

308
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,650
That's what makes
this character so compelling.

309
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,330
- Thumbs up from me.
- Same here.

310
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,630
- To sum it up, I'm Chainsaw.
- I'm Dave.

311
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,500
We'll see you at the movies.

312
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,240
- OK.
- Let's go, people.

313
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,070
I found them at Winchell's.

314
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,470
Here, we all chipped in.

315
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,080
Hey, jelly. I'm touched.

316
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,850
This one was in the parking lot
with a surfboard.

317
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,920
This is so humiliating.

318
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,750
Pam.

319
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,320
You know, I grew up
surfing those same waves.

320
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,260
Today was phenom.

321
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,060
Three to four, breaking out of the
south, glassy, light offshore breeze.

322
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,600
Had to go for the ditch.

323
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,170
Thanks.

324
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,600
You're very spiritual.

325
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,510
But the rest of you clowns...

326
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,840
Hey, I gotta say something.
This whole thing is a joke.

327
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,420
There's a very valid reason
for summer vacation.

328
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,450
The human brain needs rest.

329
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,050
Yeah. I mean,
what are we doing here?

330
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:59,420
- Really. I don't wanna be here.
- Hey, look, this wasn't my idea.

331
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:04,220
You guys aren't fired up about English.
I wouldn't know what to do if you were.

332
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:08,100
But we're stuck here.
We're trapped like rats.

333
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,600
Anybody got any ideas?

334
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,370
Why don't we take some field trips?

335
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,200
- Can we do that?
- Sure, yeah.

336
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,020
I got permission slips right here.

337
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,160
OK, take these home,

338
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,420
have your mom or dad sign them,
I'll see what I can do.

339
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,060
- Done.
- Same here.

340
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,960
Good.

341
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,070
The Screwdriver
was a disappointment.

342
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,770
I was hoping for a headache
or pounding temples,

343
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,070
a blackout, but, you know,
I feel fine.

344
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,440
Actually, my headache is gone.
Thumbs down.

345
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,710
I'm surprised. I found
the Screwdriver simply delightful.

346
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,220
Fast corners.
That third loop was a surprise.

347
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,320
The line moved fast.

348
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,150
Is he OK?

349
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,120
No, it appears
that he's vomiting.

350
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,360
That's a sure sign
of a good ride. Thumbs up.

351
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,590
Eakian, what did you eat?

352
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,200
Don't be a pig. No.

353
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,470
Hey! Hey, you slime.

354
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,610
Stones' first farewell tour, '69.
Get out of here.

355
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:09,750
- Oh, wait.
- He ripped my T-shirt.

356
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,350
Oh, I can sew that.

357
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,710
It's not necessary.
Go away!

358
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,750
Nothing's necessary.
I want to.

359
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,290
Great, I'll let you.

360
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:24,160
Get them off! Get them off me!

361
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,530
The bunnies from hell!

362
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,900
Oh, God!

363
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,870
Get away from me!

364
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,370
Oh, dear!

365
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,590
- Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
- Thank you very much.

366
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,260
What is this? It's a lie.

367
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,560
- We did this for you.
- How did you like it?

368
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,500
It's disgusting!

369
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,800
I love it.

370
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,010
- What is that?
- Oh, it's foam latex.

371
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,440
Keep it.

372
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,640
You guys.

373
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,860
Next field trip,
it's gotta be at the beach.

374
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,190
We gotta see Anna-Maria
in a bikini. It's very important.

375
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,830
I understand.

376
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,610
Girl, this ain't the Riviera.

377
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,750
Thank you.

378
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:03,320
That was... That was...
That was cruel.

379
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,400
You OK?

380
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,950
Come in, come in, Mrs. Eakian.

381
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,860
Now, how can I help you?

382
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,000
Yesterday Alan came
home nauseous, sneezing,

383
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,640
wheezing and itching,
with goat hairs on his clothes.

384
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,300
He said he was at the museum,

385
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,030
- but I found this in his pocket.
- Grandma...

386
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,740
Is going on throw-up rides
and rubbing barnyard animals

387
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,740
your idea of quality education?

388
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,440
- Grandma...
- Certainly not.

389
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,810
We'll talk to Mr. Shoop
about this right now.

390
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,980
I may have used poor judgment.

391
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,420
You actually used judgment.

392
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,780
Do you realize if anything happened
to these kids, the lawsuits?

393
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,150
You could've bankrupt
the entire district!

394
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,020
And mess up your chance
at election to state assembly?

395
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:12,670
- Yes.
- Don't wet your pants. Watch this.

396
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,930
All you had to do was
babysit some social deviants.

397
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,730
Those deviants are great kids.

398
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,430
I'm sure they'll grow up
to be wonderful criminals.

399
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,080
- They're as smart as you and me.
- You and I.

400
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,540
All of us.

401
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,710
You're suspended until Kelban
returns and fires you.

402
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,220
What?

403
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,910
Hey, this is your fault.
You knew I couldn't teach.

404
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,920
Goodbye, Mr. Shoop.

405
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,630
Gills, what if I become
a model teacher?

406
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,680
This is gonna be fun. OK.

407
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,050
You get every kid left in your class
to pass that skills test

408
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,410
and I'll forget
about your field trips.

409
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,390
Done.

410
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,360
- They all have to pass?
- It's called teaching.

411
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,190
If you don't know how to do that,

412
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,800
then I guess you don't
deserve tenure. Do you?

413
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,670
I'll teach.

414
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,180
Morning, class.

415
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,840
Nice tie!

416
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,880
Oh, baby.

417
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:42,580
Mr. Shoop, what's with the
threads, man? You getting married?

418
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:45,260
No, must be laundry day.
Nothing else was clean.

419
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,790
- Funeral?
- Could we come?

420
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,890
Please take your seats.

421
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,130
- Where should we take them?
- Sit down, Francis.

422
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,640
From this moment forth, you people
eat English, sleep English.

423
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,570
You are English.

424
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,610
Oh, then pass the crumpets, old boy.

425
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,370
I'm not kidding around.

426
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:10,070
Anyone not interested in passing
that exam can leave right now.

427
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,590
The guy's been pretty cool.

428
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:22,160
He called me Francis.
Hasta luego, Placido Domingo.

429
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,890
Chainsaw, Dave, wait a minute.

430
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,330
Look, Gills is having a cow
about our field trips.

431
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:34,910
Unless you guys all pass
that test, my job? Memorex.

432
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,000
Anybody got any ideas here?

433
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,580
Get yourself some want ads.

434
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,810
I don't care what your files say.
You are not that dumb.

435
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,850
Actually, Mr. Shoop, those files
are usually right on the money.

436
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,820
- You all feel that way?
- I do.

437
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,650
- I may as well go home.
- Mr. Shoop?

438
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,950
Look, we don't want
you to lose your job.

439
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,520
Think about what you're asking.

440
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,830
- You want us to study?
- The thought did cross my mind.

441
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,630
- Well, what's in it for us?
- Literacy.

442
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,160
Oh, sorry, that's...

443
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,970
- I'd like to help. What can I do?
- Give me your car.

444
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,650
- Your house.
- And your dog.

445
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:17,250
- See you.
- Wait, wait! Mr. Shoop, wait!

446
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,880
There's room to negotiate.

447
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,120
What if you granted
each one of us one wish?

448
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,090
What do you mean, "wish"?

449
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,850
You know, like a favor.

450
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,620
Does anybody need anything?

451
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:34,130
I need somebody to work out with,
in case I get back on the team.

452
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,900
- I could use a Lamaze coach.
- I need some driving lessons. Bad.

453
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,910
OK, there's two of us.
Therefore, we get two.

454
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:48,100
All right. One, a party, your house,
Fourth of July weekend.

455
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,810
In Anna-Maria's honor.

456
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,080
Number two, you arrange
a screening, in class,

457
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,850
of the greatest movie ever made.

458
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:59,890
The 1973 Tobe Hooper classic
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

459
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:02,760
- That is also in Anna-Maria's honor.
- Thank you.

460
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,330
Now, then, is there
anything that you desire?

461
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,930
Oh, I don't deserve a wish.
I don't take the test anyway.

462
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,930
God, she is so honest.
We'll take hers.

463
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:17,300
Chauffeur service for Dave and I,
every day, to and from work.

464
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,010
Pam, what's your wish?

465
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,580
I'll tell Mr. Shoop
when the time is right.

466
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,850
Larry?

467
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:35,720
- Larry, what do you want?
- Bed.

468
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,560
He wants a bed.

469
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:42,860
As for myself, I just wanna be
invited to the party.

470
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,910
- We'll see.
- Good enough.

471
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,800
I think these are fair
and reasonable requests.

472
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:54,280
In return, we'll show up,
we'll pay attention

473
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,810
and we'll even do a little homework.

474
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:00,680
- Is this contract acceptable to labor?
- No doubt.

475
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:03,120
- Yeah.
- Does management agree?

476
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,380
- You sure I'm management?
- For our purposes here, yes.

477
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,500
Do we have a binding agreement?

478
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,170
We got something.

479
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:18,530
All right. Well, we put
that baby to bed.

480
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:24,000
Let's do lunch.
I always wanted to say that.

481
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:29,250
- Well, go ahead. Teach.
- Right.

482
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,780
Teach.

483
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,020
Don't anybody move.

484
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,450
- The Non-Proliferation Treaty.
- Beagman?

485
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,420
- Excuse me, Miss Bishop.
- Mr. Shoop.

486
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:44,560
Shouldn't you be planning
a field trip to 7-Eleven?

487
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:47,060
I need your help.
I know how you feel about me,

488
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,900
but something really bizarre
has happened to my kids.

489
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,640
- Please.
- All right.

490
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,830
If I get next door and there's a
candlelight dinner, I'm calling security.

491
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,810
- Continue.
- The 1970 Seabed Treaty.

492
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,240
Do you own that suit?

493
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,260
- What did you do, pass out Valiums?
- This is a natural lull.

494
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:15,760
Interesting phenomenon.
What do you want from me?

495
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,860
How do you teach?

496
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:23,560
- If you're serious, I'll help you.
- Great.

497
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:27,040
Meet me after school.
We'll make plans for the weekend.

498
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,070
For the weekend?

499
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:34,270
Big guy. OK.

500
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,860
The easiest thing to do
is base your lesson plans

501
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,960
on the students' own experiences.

502
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,530
- I can do that.
- Your life is probably very similar.

503
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:53,390
Hardly. I'm telling you,
you gotta try these Pop-Tarts.

504
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,260
No, thanks.

505
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,060
I'm sticking with the Chocodiles.

506
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:01,900
The best teachers are the teachers
who entertain while they teach.

507
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:05,340
- So you should do just fine.
- You think I'm entertaining?

508
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,480
To children.

509
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,520
- I gotta go. Time's up.
- I know why you're helping me.

510
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,690
- Professional courtesy.
- No. You like me.

511
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:17,580
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

512
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,450
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do.

513
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,920
- Do not.
- Do too.

514
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,690
- Don't either.
- Come on.

515
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,090
- Don't you like me just a little bit?
- No.

516
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,490
Not even that much?

517
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,230
I like you that much.

518
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,940
It's a start.

519
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,940
Now, someone tell me why
learning how to write is so critical.

520
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:49,490
- It's a form of communication.
- Amen. And it can get you free stuff.

521
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:53,820
- Free?
- Free. I'm writing the word...

522
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:58,360
...free. Here's how it works.
All of us have been ripped off, right?

523
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:01,330
Pay phone steals money,
not enough cheese on your pizza.

524
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,970
- My shades keep falling apart.
- Perfect.

525
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,870
You're gonna write that company.

526
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,770
You'll see action,
if your letter is clearly written

527
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,810
and threatens to hurt their business.

528
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:13,170
And is signed, forgive me, Chainsaw,

529
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,710
"Mr. Francis Gremp, president,
Consumer Against Faulty Eyewear."

530
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,720
You want me to lie? OK.

531
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,050
Anyone interested
in learning the correct form,

532
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:27,350
please turn to page 46
in your textbook.

533
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,760
The shit works.

534
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:36,370
Damn!

535
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,770
Stupid son of a...

536
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:44,040
- I'm not cut out to be a linebacker.
- No, you're looking at my shoulders.

537
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,180
Don't. Focus on my waist.
OK? My waist.

538
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,780
All right, try it again. Go on.

539
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:56,550
That's good.
Remember, I'm your teacher.

540
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,590
You wanna learn how to surf?

541
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,570
- You sure you wanna do this?
- Absolutely.

542
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:14,000
Lamaze class,
great place to meet girls.

543
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,110
OK, Denise, slide over.

544
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,890
Oh, no, no, no.

545
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:32,180
Is this some kind of sick, twisted joke?

546
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,880
No, I'm combining Denise's driving
lesson with your ride to the beach.

547
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,830
We took driver training
with Denise. Call us a cab.

548
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,830
Get your grisly butts in the car.

549
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:43,970
Man, let me drive.
I'm going for my license next week.

550
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,730
- Chainsaw, you've been drinking.
- No, it's cough medicine.

551
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,500
Check out this phlegm.

552
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,340
Save the phlegm.
You're not driving anywhere.

553
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:58,450
I'll tell you something. You know why
so many drunk drivers get in wrecks?

554
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,710
- They don't learn to drive drunk.
- Fact: Alcohol kills brain cells.

555
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,950
You lose one more, you're
a talking monkey. Come on, get in.

556
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,150
Come on.

557
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,930
OK, Denise, start her up.

558
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,230
Signal left. Pull on out.

559
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,300
Can I call my folks
and say I won't be home... ever?

560
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,040
I'm not used to this car.

561
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,620
I think it's safe.

562
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,620
Move it out.

563
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:46,160
Nice and smooth. Oh, yeah, that's...

564
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,030
Fine. Good.

565
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,680
- Why did you do that?
- A car was coming.

566
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,280
Well, it'll happen from time to time.

567
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:08,420
Come on, Denise,
he won't bother us.

568
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,390
We just got lapped
by an old lady with a walker.

569
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,990
- See that space between those cars?
- Yeah.

570
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,930
- Pull in.
- Parallel park? That's my weak spot.

571
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,430
Listen to her.

572
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,740
OK.

573
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,780
- I'm sober now.
- That's good for today.

574
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,210
- We live!
- We live!

575
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,820
It's beautiful.

576
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,890
Enough safe and sane.
It's time for dumb and dangerous.

577
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,730
These are Mexican. You do not
know what's in these babies.

578
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,500
Hey, get me a brew.

579
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,910
Coming through.

580
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,120
Anna-Maria, as far as we know,
this has never, ever been attempted.

581
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:18,260
Anna-Maria, we dedicate
these cantaloupe to you.

582
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:22,160
You make fruit bombs for me?
Oh, how sweet.

583
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:27,270
- Melon balls, coming up!
- We're gonna make these babies fly!

584
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,870
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

585
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,550
You're awake. I wanna talk.

586
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,440
- Not now, babe, I'm late.
- Late for what?

587
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,520
What's it like being pregnant?

588
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:55,700
- Bizarre.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

589
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,860
My body is out of control
and it's big and ugly.

590
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,760
- I think you look great.
- Sure, in the dark.

591
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,930
How much longer?

592
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,280
About five weeks.

593
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:18,510
- It's gonna be amazing.
- Yeah, I know.

594
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,080
You'll be a mother.

595
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,280
Yeah.

596
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:26,620
Eakian, this party's getting weak.

597
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:28,820
Do something wild.
Take all your clothes off.

598
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,900
Why? You want everyone
to go home?

599
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:37,400
You're almost fun tonight.

600
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,170
Almost.

601
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,340
- You all right?
- Yeah. Come on in.

602
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,990
I'm just resting up. Too much fun.

603
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:56,210
It's all sewn.

604
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,050
Hey, thanks. That's great.

605
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:07,330
- I feel so at home here.
- Yeah, me too.

606
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,660
Yeah.

607
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:14,200
The grunion are running tonight.

608
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:19,540
In the dead of night,
under a full moon,

609
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:23,510
thousands of horny little fish
swim hundreds of miles

610
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,280
to ball their brains out in the sand.

611
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,890
It's so romantic.

612
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,190
You ever do that
with one of your students?

613
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:39,920
No. I swim hundreds of miles,
I'm ready for a nap.

614
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:44,100
Who's that?

615
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:49,070
Oh, it's Kim.
She's sort of my girlfriend.

616
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,540
- "Sort of"?
- Well, she's in Hawaii.

617
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:59,950
So you're all alone
and you like young girls.

618
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:03,120
Kim's not that young. She's 21.

619
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,990
I'm 16. And you should
consider that.

620
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:10,920
Because there's, like, no difference
between 21 and 16 now,

621
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:16,570
but when she's 66,
I'll only be 61.

622
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,740
And I'll be 75
and it won't matter anyway.

623
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,340
Yeah.

624
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:42,690
Come on, Pam. Time for more fun.

625
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,790
Wondermutt!

626
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,700
Out of my way!

627
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:01,970
Watch your ass, folks! Banzai!

628
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:19,060
- Oh, shit.
- Fire!

629
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,200
Do something!

630
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,140
- Jesus Christ, my couch is on fire!
- Come on, Dave.

631
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:34,180
What? What? What?

632
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:50,120
- All right, we took care of it.
- My fish!

633
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:52,260
- How many were there?
- One.

634
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:55,720
Poor fishy.

635
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,730
Get rid of that couch.
That is a definite fire hazard.

636
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,770
- Definitely.
- Party's over.

637
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,030
It was just getting good.
We got a fire...

638
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,870
Good night!

639
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,210
One little fire.

640
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:11,110
Big deal.

641
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:22,990
- Minors drinking on the beach.
- Seriously, we never do this.

642
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,600
Boy, never, ever. There's our
English teacher, let's ask him.

643
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,240
Mr. Shoop, sir, could you come here
just a moment, please?

644
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,100
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

645
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:35,970
- What's up?
- Found these boys with alcohol.

646
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,410
That alcohol, officer?
Oh, that's not theirs.

647
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:42,980
Whose is it?

648
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:48,680
It's mine. See, I live
in that house right there

649
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,510
and they were just
watching my stuff.

650
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,270
That's right. It's his.

651
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,040
We should never have taken those
little baby sips. That was wrong.

652
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:59,690
God, so very, very wrong.

653
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:03,090
I think they learned
one hell of a lesson, officer.

654
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:06,920
Next time you boys encounter alcohol,
remember you're underage.

655
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:10,000
- Yes, sir, we will.
- Yeah, of course, thank...

656
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,000
Thank you.

657
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,400
- Well, we're off to do our homework.
- Yeah. Thank you. Bye.

658
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:18,100
- We shouldn't have tried this.
- It was a mistake.

659
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:21,440
That was bad.
We should've just said no.

660
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,580
- You guys are good men.
- Thank you.

661
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,150
Thank you.

662
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:31,120
You're under arrest for contributing
to the delinquency of a minor.

663
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,790
- Officer, that's not really my vodka.
- Is that your dog?

664
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:38,530
- Yeah.
- No dogs on the beach, $50 fine.

665
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:41,250
He's not really my dog.
He just thinks he's my dog.

666
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:42,990
No, he's a neighborhood dog.

667
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,100
He hangs out at my place
because there's garbage there.

668
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,330
He's a scavenger. He'll eat anything.
He's a beach dog, really.

669
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,900
Go away, beach dog.

670
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,070
Do you have a cell for beginners?

671
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:03,310
- Boogie boy.
- Bunk in here.

672
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:07,490
- Moondoggie.
- Yeah.

673
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:09,890
Who wants gum?

674
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,430
Leave your message
after the beep.

675
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:17,530
Robin, it's your pal, Shoop.

676
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:20,460
I can't leave my number
because I'm downtown in jail.

677
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:22,370
- Jail?
- What, you're surprised?

678
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:27,340
I got arrested in my swim trunks, so
I need 50 bucks and a pair of shoes.

679
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,840
Listen, please don't mention
this to that bite in the ass Gills.

680
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:33,380
You're an angel.
Dinner, dancing, Paris...

681
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,110
Hello, Mr. Shoop.

682
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,120
- Who is this?
- The bite in the ass.

683
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:43,220
When I say "bite in the ass", I mean
that in the nicest possible way.

684
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:44,760
Can I talk to Robin?

685
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:48,960
I'm afraid Robin and I
are on our way out of town.

686
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:51,730
But don't worry, we'll be right over.

687
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:55,040
He's still a human being, Phillip.

688
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,600
We have a very long drive.
If we go downtown now,

689
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:00,540
we'll be stuck in traffic.
And that's OK with me,

690
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:05,880
because we'll be helping Shoop
and you won't think I'm a shit. Right?

691
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,210
Am I in really big trouble?

692
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,150
Arrested for contributing
to the delinquency of minors?

693
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,550
You're not a hero.

694
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,620
What is this?

695
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:19,420
I made a new friend.

696
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,630
Mr. Shoop, I do hope we can get you
out of this ugly mess. And it is ugly.

697
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:28,000
Mr. Shoop's been making
a lot of progress in his class, Phillip.

698
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,700
It's true. I've been handing out
assignments and the kids turn them in.

699
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:35,210
- It's almost like school in there.
- I've heard. And I'm proud.

700
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:38,400
Confirms all my instincts
about him. He's my boy.

701
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:42,950
Robin, let's get out of here.

702
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:45,420
We're on our way to wine country.

703
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:49,580
You kids have fun.

704
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,430
See those waves, Wondermutt?

705
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,770
They're from Hawaii.

706
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:08,600
Kim's in Hawaii.

707
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:12,480
Robin's in the wine country.

708
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:18,120
You know what we need?
I mean, besides bread.

709
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:22,550
We need a woman
who will appreciate

710
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,920
what we have to offer.

711
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:27,390
A woman of culture...

712
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:29,730
...intellect.

713
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:33,040
Shake those buns, baby!

714
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:43,310
Bring those buns over here. Mama's
got some software for you, baby.

715
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:49,540
Excuse me.
I'm with Playgirl magazine.

716
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,890
Survey me later, I'm trying
to concentrate. Come on, baby.

717
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,320
Thanks for your time.

718
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,390
Shoot them buns over here.

719
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:11,260
Hey!

720
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:17,570
Hey, cowboy! Don't I know you?

721
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:21,050
Hey, back off, hair-bag,
this is ladies' night.

722
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,680
I love him, I love him, I love him.

723
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:27,250
Larry!

724
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:30,630
Mr. Shoop. What are you doing here?

725
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:33,690
What am I doing here?
You do this every night?

726
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,830
Well, we have Mondays off.

727
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:39,060
Listen, man, you can't tell
anybody, OK? They think I'm 21.

728
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:43,900
You were fabulous.
This is from both of us.

729
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:46,340
I'm in the wrong business.
But about school,

730
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:49,940
if you could sneak in a couple
hours' sleep, you'd catch up.

731
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:52,510
Mr. Shoop, man,
think about what you're saying.

732
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,340
I mean, if you could be 17 again,

733
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:57,250
only you knew then
what you know now.

734
00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:00,580
- Yeah.
- Well, I know.

735
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,920
I hate that kid.

736
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:10,860
"Who we admire most
in the world and why.

737
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:14,330
"The person we admire most
in the world is makeup artist

738
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,440
"and creature creator Rick Baker."

739
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,540
"His wonderfully gruesome slime
bladders and slobber tubes

740
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:24,480
"in American Werewolf in London
won him a richly deserved Oscar.

741
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:29,180
"That is why we admire makeup artist
and creature creator Rick Baker

742
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:31,950
"very, very, very,
very, very, very..."

743
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,250
"Very, very, very, very, very..."

744
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:38,150
"Very, very, very, very, very,
very, very, very, very, very..."

745
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,460
"Very, very, very, very, very much."

746
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:44,690
- It's 100 words on the nose.
- You can count if you want.

747
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,770
"It is not easy to pick
the person I admire most.

748
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:50,000
"I admire people
for different reasons.

749
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:55,110
"The way they surf or teach English
from the heart or help the homeless.

750
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:58,250
"To pick one person
is so unfair to everyone else.

751
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:00,810
"Isn't there enough pain
in the world?"

752
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:04,980
Since there's no one I admire most,
this is about a person I admire least,

753
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:07,520
my ex-boyfriend, Andre.

754
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,120
If he tells you he broke up
with me, he's lying,

755
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:12,790
because I told him
to get out of my face first.

756
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,020
You know how I could tell
when he's lying? His lips move.

757
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:19,930
I'm serious. He's so in love with
himself, he ought to be dating a mirror.

758
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:21,760
He's in skin-tight leather pants,

759
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:25,700
thinking he's Rick James' little brother.
Give the world a break.

760
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:28,980
- Denise, can I have your paper?
- No.

761
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,650
- No?
- Well, I had to memorize my essay

762
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:35,680
due to the fact
I was mugged by a gang

763
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:37,720
looking for money and homework.

764
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,980
That happens.

765
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:46,890
OK, gang, mark your calendars.
Field trip next Monday.

766
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,160
Where are we going, cockfights?

767
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:52,090
Courthouse.

768
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:57,070
Your teacher was arrested
for giving vodka to some kids.

769
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:00,900
You and Dave won't want to miss it.

770
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:04,200
- You went to jail for us?
- On roller skates.

771
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:06,610
Thanks, man.

772
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:28,270
Pam?

773
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:30,440
Hi.

774
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:34,110
What are you doing here?

775
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:38,080
Remember I said I'd tell you my wish
when the time was right? It's right.

776
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:43,120
- Your wish is to move in with me?
- I'm a great cook.

777
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:50,920
I won't get in your way.

778
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:54,060
You know we connect.

779
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:58,170
- Pam, look, my place is very small.
- It's perfect.

780
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,430
Look, Tommy, that's my brother,
he had another kid

781
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,600
and Angela, she's his wife, wants to
move the twins back into Gail's room

782
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:09,400
and put Sally in the den,
so I lose the couch.

783
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:13,310
- Yeah, well, my couch is barbecued.
- The floor is fine.

784
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,080
Mr. Shoop, everybody else
got their wish.

785
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:25,450
OK, Pam.

786
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,650
If I let you stay here,

787
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:30,990
it's only temporary
until you find another place, OK?

788
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,530
I can stay.

789
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,830
Who are you talking to?

790
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,640
This is Tommy and Angela
and Gail and Sally and Sly

791
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:45,340
and the twins, Chuck and Bob,
and Tommy, Jr.

792
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:46,780
This is Mr. Shoop.

793
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,750
- How are you?
- Pleased to meet you.

794
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:55,520
She screams so well.

795
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:59,220
Oh, don't be a wuss.

796
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:01,360
Shut up!

797
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,260
Run, run.

798
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:06,030
Larry! Larry, wake up,
you're missing this.

799
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,500
Larry's not missing a thing.
Let him sleep.

800
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:12,370
- There he is.
- Leatherface, Leatherface.

801
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,570
Oh, no.

802
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:20,510
That's not a real person.
It's a stuntman.

803
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:24,280
OK, now, this... This right here
isn't gonna bother him,

804
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:27,290
because he's insane, OK?

805
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,460
Good Lord.

806
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,630
- What are you watching?
- Do the dance.

807
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:39,830
A new film from the district,
Safe Use of Power Tools.

808
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,560
Delivery. I don't want
to know what this is, do I?

809
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:45,070
No, probably not.

810
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:47,110
Come on.

811
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:50,040
- What a finish, ladies and gentlemen.
- It was great.

812
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:51,770
What did you think of that?

813
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:54,780
- God, it was really American.
- American, yes.

814
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:58,550
It's an American masterpiece.

815
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,820
Talk about gutsy endings.
The girl gets away

816
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:04,290
and our hero, Leatherface,
chainsaws his legs.

817
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:06,760
- Two thumbs up.
- Make that four for gore.

818
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,160
Listen up, I wanna
read you something:

819
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:12,430
"Dear Mr. Francis Gremp,
thank you for informing us

820
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,160
"of your problem with our
Cool Dude sunglasses."

821
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,070
It worked.

822
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:20,040
"Please accept these
Cool Dudes with our compliments."

823
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,300
All right, it's Christmastime.
Free glasses.

824
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:24,950
- Are these free?
- Yes.

825
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:27,240
"We know you'll find them
well-constructed

826
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:31,320
"and we hope your organization
will see no need to boycott.

827
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,550
"Sincerely, Wayne Appleton,
president, Cool Dude, Inc."

828
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,290
- All right, the power of the pen.
- Hey, thanks, Chainsaw.

829
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:43,560
Hey, Eakian. Eakian. Man, you think
you can help me with my letter,

830
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:45,170
make it sound official?

831
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:47,730
Sure, Denise.

832
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,000
You wanna give it to me?

833
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,610
OK, tonight, for homework,

834
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:02,340
write a review of
Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

835
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:06,220
Rhonda?

836
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:11,820
If you're not doing anything tomorrow,
I thought we could do something.

837
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:14,860
Oh, I have Lamaze class
tomorrow night.

838
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:19,230
- Do you wanna go with me?
- What about Mr. Shoop?

839
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,000
Oh, he won't care. I mean,
if you don't mind being my coach.

840
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:27,400
- I wouldn't mind at all.
- Great.

841
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:29,740
Great.

842
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,510
See you, Eak.

843
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:35,380
Mr. Shoop...

844
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:42,920
...you should see this, but you can't
let Denise know I showed you. OK?

845
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:44,820
OK.

846
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,600
Shoop, this girl's dyslexic.

847
00:56:57,810 --> 00:56:59,740
What? That's not in her file.

848
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,780
This is serious.
You gotta get her some help.

849
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:06,470
How could she get this far
with no one finding out?

850
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,870
She slipped through the system.

851
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:11,680
What happens when
she gets out in the real world?

852
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:16,350
Wait! Is this the same guy that took
his English class to the petting zoo?

853
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:20,090
- How'd you get those kids to work?
- Bribed them.

854
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,590
What would it take to have dinner
with you?

855
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,600
That would be very expensive.

856
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:36,440
- I'm having dinner with Gills.
- Big Phil again, huh?

857
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,880
Robin, be honest,
isn't he a bite in the ass?

858
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:43,250
No, he's not a bite in the ass.
He happens to be very...

859
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:50,490
...articulate... cultured...

860
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:53,420
...extraordinarily tidy.

861
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:56,460
Tall, dark and tidy.
That's a magic combination.

862
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,460
- You're not in love.
- None of your business.

863
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:01,900
- Sure, it is.
- No.

864
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,400
Tell me you love him,
I'll stop asking you out.

865
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,670
How am I gonna tell you
I love him when it's so new?

866
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:11,440
I knew it. See, Robin,
he is not the guy for you.

867
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:15,410
You need an intelligent,
sensitive man who can skate.

868
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:19,880
- Do you know such a guy?
- Oh, they're hard to find.

869
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:22,390
But now that I know,
I'll keep my eye out.

870
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:24,560
Would you?

871
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:26,990
Looking good, Denise. Good luck.

872
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,690
Sir, you are really gonna
earn your money today.

873
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:38,400
- Francis Gremp?
- Call me Chainsaw.

874
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:42,310
- You're up next.
- Can you hold on a sec?

875
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:44,640
Dad's late. He's so irresponsible.

876
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:50,080
I said, "Dad, 3:00 sharp." But no,
it's just in one ear, out the other.

877
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:51,510
I need your car.

878
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:55,690
- You wanna use my car?
- I'm under adult supervision.

879
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:01,720
Chainsaw, you take your test

880
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:05,030
and you bring my car
right back here to me.

881
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:08,800
You make me proud to be
an American. Dave, kiss this man.

882
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:12,630
You, come with me. No, no, you
stay there. I'll bring the car to you.

883
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:16,300
Can you back this up? I'm taking
a test. Just move all the way back.

884
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:25,650
- What? What'd I do?
- Don't worry about me.

885
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,760
See those cars on the right?
Go ahead and park in between.

886
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,360
What do you mean?
You mean parallel park?

887
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:34,530
- Something wrong?
- No, nothing.

888
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:52,480
Yeah.

889
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:56,480
We going on the freeway?

890
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:59,590
I think we'll just stay
in the neighborhood.

891
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:05,520
Why are you driving
with only one hand?

892
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:09,320
Oh, this hand's gotta be free
to put around the babes.

893
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:13,330
- Are you marking me off for that?
- Watch the dip!

894
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,930
That dip?

895
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:18,840
Hey, you crazy?

896
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:22,340
Don't you ever, ever yell at the driver!
Do you hear me?

897
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:25,110
- Where are you going?
- Back. The test is over.

898
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:27,320
No way!

899
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:29,940
That was your fault.

900
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:32,550
This is bullshit. Come on.

901
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,950
I stayed sober for this.
You can't do this.

902
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,180
Come back, you dumb dildo.
Wait, no, you're not a dildo.

903
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:43,300
I was joking. That was a joke.
Come on, be cool. One more chance?

904
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,800
Wait.

905
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:50,800
You lost points for driving too slow
and not accepting the right of way.

906
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:53,980
- Failed again.
- 70 is passing.

907
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:55,670
Seventy-two.

908
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:59,110
- I passed?
- You passed.

909
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,110
I passed! Oh, I passed! I passed!

910
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:05,250
Shoop, I passed!

911
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:07,680
I passed!

912
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:12,520
- I passed! God, I passed! Thanks!
- I'm proud of you. Congratulations.

913
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:15,960
- I couldn't have done it without you.
- Now, you drove the car.

914
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:18,570
- Look, I owe you one, all right?
- Yeah?

915
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:20,400
Yeah.

916
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,230
OK. Tell you something
you can do for me.

917
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:25,440
- What?
- Get help with reading.

918
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,110
- Man.
- Listen, Denise.

919
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:30,140
What you have is a learning disorder
called dyslexia.

920
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:33,440
You need to retrain your brain
to deal with information.

921
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:35,640
- There's a specialist.
- I'm doing fine.

922
01:01:35,850 --> 01:01:39,750
Yeah, you are.
But you could be doing so much better.

923
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:42,150
But that's up to you.

924
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,150
Hey.

925
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:46,960
- Think about it, OK?
- OK, free film.

926
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,500
Free developing.
Come on, what more could you want?

927
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,330
Here.

928
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:57,000
Look, my dad's a butcher. You like
veal cutlets from Minnesota? Milk-fed.

929
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:18,020
Hi, honey, how was your day?

930
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:20,560
Hectic.

931
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:24,460
- Boy, something smells good.
- The manicotti.

932
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:28,540
Perfect timing. Why don't you
start on the cheese and crackers.

933
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:31,900
Yeah. It's open.

934
01:02:32,110 --> 01:02:34,130
- Hi.
- Hey.

935
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:37,240
I just brought this Ray Bradbury book.

936
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:39,810
- Maybe I should come back later.
- Why?

937
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,050
- Hi, Miss Bishop.
- Hi.

938
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:49,150
Oh, Robin, Pam House,
one of my students.

939
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,420
Pam, Robin Bishop.

940
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,850
- Hi.
- Hi, Pam.

941
01:02:56,570 --> 01:03:00,400
Freddy, I didn't make enough for three.
If you plan on inviting company,

942
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,800
- I wish you'd let me know.
- No, he wasn't.

943
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:05,030
I stopped by to help him with a lesson.

944
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:08,270
- But we can do that in the morning.
- Morning's much better.

945
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,240
I'll make French toast for us.
Do you like French toast?

946
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,410
I bet she makes great French toast.

947
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:16,710
- I actually meant morning at school.
- Oh, fine.

948
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:20,250
- It was nice to meet you, Pam.
- You too.

949
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:27,190
Robin?

950
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:32,030
I know this is none of my business,
but what the hell is going on in there?

951
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:35,140
There's nothing going on in there.
Remember those bribes?

952
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:38,600
- Well, Pam needed a place to stay.
- How long has she been here?

953
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:41,070
A couple of days.

954
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:44,110
My laundry's never smelled so good.
Here, take a whiff.

955
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:47,110
Oh, I'm sure it's April fresh.

956
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,480
I just hope having a maid

957
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:52,250
is worth the damage
you could do to that young girl.

958
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,720
See you tomorrow.

959
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:05,500
- All ready.
- Great.

960
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:10,100
- French or Italian?
- French.

961
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:12,170
I knew it.

962
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:17,740
- Pam, we gotta talk.
- Sure. What's up?

963
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:23,650
- I think you are a great girl.
- And I think you're a great guy.

964
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:27,120
God, this is hard.

965
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:30,020
Freddy, go ahead.
You can tell me anything.

966
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:36,630
OK. You know how,
when you're on your board,

967
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:40,700
and you see the perfect wave rolling in
and you think you got it?

968
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:43,630
Only, something happens
and you don't get it.

969
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:46,400
I mean, the key
to the whole thing is timing.

970
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:49,130
If you're even a little out of sync,
you're grim,

971
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:52,140
you're blowing the barrel,
you're seaweed.

972
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:54,370
But then you look outside

973
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:57,880
and you see an even more perfect
wave than the first perfect wave

974
01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:00,210
and that's the one you catch.

975
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:04,290
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah. Yeah, I get it.

976
01:05:04,490 --> 01:05:07,950
Surfing metaphors. You're
the perfect wave and I'm seaweed

977
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,860
- and if you want me out, just say it.
- No, no, I'm not the perfect wave.

978
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:13,860
And it's not just that I want you
out of my house.

979
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:16,230
No, you want me out of your life.

980
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:20,700
- Pam, look, I'm your teacher.
- No.

981
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:25,010
Any time one person lets themself
care deeply about another person,

982
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:28,580
that person runs the risk
of being rejected and destroyed.

983
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:31,510
- I'll go get my things.
- No, wait. You cooked dinner.

984
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:34,150
It looks beautiful.
Let's sit down, eat.

985
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:37,220
It's just food.

986
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:45,430
OK. I'm gonna collect
your book reports.

987
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,330
Then we are on our way to court.

988
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:50,440
Homework, Pam?

989
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:54,540
You expect me to relate
to the written word

990
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:57,230
after the hell you put me through?

991
01:05:57,450 --> 01:06:00,180
Talk about shallow.
I've stepped in deeper puddles.

992
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:02,280
You're excused.

993
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,250
Mr. Shoop, don't you want mine?

994
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:13,060
Larry, you're awake, with homework.
What's wrong with you?

995
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,250
I got fired.
They found out my real age.

996
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:18,560
- Hey, I didn't say a word.
- No, my mom came to a show.

997
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:21,260
- Your mother?
- It was a nightmare.

998
01:06:21,470 --> 01:06:24,870
I mean, before she knew who I was,
she put 5 bucks in my G-string.

999
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:28,170
And then my Aunt Edna,
she kisses me.

1000
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:31,110
With tongue.
And rips off my mask.

1001
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:33,370
Mom freaked out.

1002
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:35,110
She made me put on her coat.

1003
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,950
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

1004
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:39,680
I'm at my sexual peak.

1005
01:06:39,890 --> 01:06:43,620
Once a guy hits 18,
it's all downhill.

1006
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:46,490
But it's a lovely ride.

1007
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:49,330
Mr. Shoop, why did you tell
the arresting officers

1008
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:51,360
that the vodka found
in the possession

1009
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:55,300
of Mr. Gremp and Mr. Frazier
belonged to you?

1010
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:58,340
Your Honor, to keep
a couple of students out of trouble.

1011
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:01,480
David and Francis
have enough problems as it is.

1012
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:04,610
- It's true, Your Honor.
- Our lives are a mess.

1013
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,080
Guys, don't help.

1014
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:11,640
Where did you young men
obtain the vodka in question?

1015
01:07:11,850 --> 01:07:13,320
- From Murray.
- Who's Murray?

1016
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,750
You know Murray.
Everybody knows Murray.

1017
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,860
From Murray's Liquor.

1018
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:21,360
Didn't this Murray ask
to see proof of age?

1019
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,430
Well, I come off pretty mature.

1020
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:26,970
- Did you show him proof of age?
- Yeah, I guess I did.

1021
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:29,260
May I see it, please?

1022
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:31,670
- I'd rather you didn't.
- I'd rather I did.

1023
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:43,310
You were a black Marine in 1968?

1024
01:07:45,090 --> 01:07:46,450
Vietnam.

1025
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:49,060
A war puts a man through
many, many changes.

1026
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:53,420
Young man, the possession of false
identification and of alcohol by a minor

1027
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:56,860
are serious crimes.
You've just confessed to both of them.

1028
01:07:57,070 --> 01:08:00,130
- I didn't mean to.
- However, since the arresting officers

1029
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:03,960
let you off with a warning,
I'll probably do the same.

1030
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:07,040
- Is this guy bitchen or what?
- Now, Mr. Shoop...

1031
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:09,070
Your Honor?

1032
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:11,870
My name is Robin Elizabeth Bishop

1033
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:15,170
and I'm also on the faculty
with the defendant.

1034
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:19,080
I submit that this man
went to jail for his students.

1035
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:23,220
Very few teachers ever exhibit
that degree of dedication.

1036
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:25,220
Therefore, Your Honor,
I move that...

1037
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:28,620
Don't move, Miss Bishop.
You're out of order.

1038
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:32,560
And you're also correct. Mr. Shoop,
these charges will be dropped.

1039
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:35,000
- Case dismissed.
- All right!

1040
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,970
All right! That's so...

1041
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:43,810
Shoop! Let me tell you something.

1042
01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:46,240
The judge bought
that dedicated teacher crap,

1043
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:49,080
but you covered up,
thus condoning student drinking.

1044
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:52,880
I am filing a report for Kelban
with the entire story. Face it.

1045
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:58,150
The test scores won't save you,
because they're losers, just like you!

1046
01:08:58,660 --> 01:08:59,890
Hi.

1047
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:03,600
I was just congratulating
our good friend Mr. Shoop.

1048
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:07,800
- Now, about lunch, sweetheart.
- Tell you what, sweetheart,

1049
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,500
why don't you go ahead, order
two lunches and eat them yourself.

1050
01:09:11,710 --> 01:09:14,110
One for each face.

1051
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:26,480
OK. Today we take a practice test.
Pinpoint each of your weak spots.

1052
01:09:26,690 --> 01:09:28,750
Then we work
a couple hours after school.

1053
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,260
Wait, wait.
Practice tests, extra class time?

1054
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:34,490
Not in the contract.
Eakian, get him.

1055
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:37,490
The test is in two weeks.
You need the extra work.

1056
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:40,860
Then I'm afraid we're gonna need
some extra incentive.

1057
01:09:41,070 --> 01:09:44,970
- Yeah. Like a party with a band.
- I could use some wheels bad.

1058
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:47,300
And get me a job, man,
doing strip-o-grams.

1059
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:51,670
- I don't believe this greed.
- Believe it, man. I need a houseboy.

1060
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:56,850
It's a simple matter
of renegotiating our contracts.

1061
01:09:57,050 --> 01:10:00,180
Renegotiate? Who do you
think you are, Teamsters?

1062
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:04,990
Yeah, Teamsters!
Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!

1063
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:12,230
Look! For the past four weeks,
I have given up all of my free time.

1064
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:15,530
Had my body used for a tackling
dummy, my house trashed,

1065
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:18,770
my couch set on fire,
my goldfish murdered,

1066
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:22,100
my butt thrown in jail
and my car wrecked.

1067
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:26,650
All I'm asking for is a little extra effort.

1068
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:31,450
You know, what's sad is
you guys could all pass that test.

1069
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:36,220
But you're just so happy being failures
that you just don't know...

1070
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:38,890
Why am I doing this?

1071
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,700
Tell you what.

1072
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,960
You guys drop out and be illiterate.

1073
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:48,230
I'm going to Hawaii and be tan.

1074
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:54,570
Have a cow.

1075
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,050
Damn.

1076
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:02,550
Hey. Thanks for the help.

1077
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:05,810
Good luck.

1078
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:07,890
- Where are you going?
- To quit.

1079
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:09,790
- You can't quit.
- Sure, I can.

1080
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:13,390
- I never got through to anybody.
- Not true. They were learning.

1081
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,150
- You're not a quitter.
- I am.

1082
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,960
I turned you down for dinner
at least a dozen times

1083
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:22,190
- and you haven't quit bugging me.
- Wanna go out to dinner tonight?

1084
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,270
- Can't.
- See?

1085
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:34,780
Everybody take a seat.
You, in the cot, out of bed.

1086
01:11:35,150 --> 01:11:39,140
- Where's Mr. Shoop?
- He has tendered his resignation.

1087
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:41,120
Now, sit down.

1088
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:44,260
Would someone tell me what
Mr. Shoop had planned for today?

1089
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:47,520
- Yes?
- Group sex. No, that's tomorrow.

1090
01:11:47,730 --> 01:11:50,720
Today's independent study,
right after our midmorning nap.

1091
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:53,130
Don't think you can pull
this BS with me.

1092
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:58,430
Everybody take their textbooks out
and turn to chapter seven.

1093
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:01,270
Read it again.

1094
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:11,680
Who's making that noise?

1095
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,790
What noise? I don't hear any noise.
What, you got dog ears?

1096
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,800
- Chainsaw, stop doing that.
- Stop doing what?

1097
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:28,130
You know, I hear it too
and it's annoying.

1098
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:30,300
Find the hooligan that's responsible,

1099
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:34,840
because I am trying to read
chapter seven. Again.

1100
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:46,850
Mr. Gills, I cannot study.
I'm going to the library.

1101
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:49,460
Chainsaw, sit down.

1102
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:52,630
You can hum till your lips fall off,
I could care less.

1103
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,120
Wait a minute.
You're not dismissed.

1104
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,330
Now, I promise you, you people
act like psychopaths tomorrow

1105
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:03,300
- and you will be sorry.
- We will be sorry?

1106
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:07,640
Mr. Gills sure does know
his child psychology.

1107
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:13,480
Miss Cura, I want to let you know that
the children are a little hyperactive,

1108
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:17,080
but I'm sure that you'll
enjoy their joie de vivre.

1109
01:13:17,290 --> 01:13:19,580
So far, I've only subbed
at grammar schools,

1110
01:13:19,790 --> 01:13:23,120
so this should be a nice change.

1111
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:25,460
Help, Mr. Gills!

1112
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:28,490
Denise! Denise! Take it easy!
What happened?

1113
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:31,000
Don't go in there without a gun.
It's terrible.

1114
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,530
- Is this my classroom?
- Yes, it is.

1115
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:36,640
Whose blood is that?
Is that your blood?

1116
01:13:36,910 --> 01:13:38,810
No.

1117
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:52,320
My God.

1118
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:35,090
We're back!

1119
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:41,870
What is wrong with you people?

1120
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:47,040
It's like you said, Gills!
We're psychopaths!

1121
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:51,150
Somebody better call the school nurse!

1122
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,450
I am not amused!
Turn off those motors!

1123
01:14:58,350 --> 01:15:00,320
Everybody get up. Now!

1124
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,430
I'm not ready for high school.

1125
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:17,730
- Why'd she leave? Didn't she like us?
- Where's her sense of humor?

1126
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:20,840
I have seen some sick things before.

1127
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,940
But this... This is...

1128
01:15:24,150 --> 01:15:25,940
- Devilishly clever.
- Vomitous!

1129
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:30,180
- Thank you.
- We take a lot of pride in our work.

1130
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:32,410
Look, we want Shoop back.

1131
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:35,150
Why would Shoop come back?
So Kelban can fire him?

1132
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,590
He might surprise you.

1133
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:42,800
- We did today.
- And we've got more for tomorrow.

1134
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:48,330
Do we have a deal?

1135
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:09,380
Wondermutt, I do not want to play.
Not now. I'm busy.

1136
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:48,590
- Tough day?
- We've been torturing Gills.

1137
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,890
Yeah.
He said you could have your job back.

1138
01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:55,030
Now, why would I want my job back?
Hey, my life is sailing.

1139
01:16:55,240 --> 01:17:02,140
I got a radio, blanket, beach chair,
dark glasses, dog.

1140
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:03,910
Why would I wanna go back?

1141
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:06,440
How about we can't pass that test
without you?

1142
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:11,250
Me and Chainsaw, we been sober for
two days, four hours and 15 minutes.

1143
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:14,580
- No kidding?
- Swear to God. Reality is so unreal.

1144
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:16,850
- But a nice change.
- Truly. Thumbs up.

1145
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:22,660
I think you should know
that you were a phase.

1146
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:24,920
I've outgrown you.

1147
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:27,800
But I do wanna be friends,
if you can handle it.

1148
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:34,880
And Shoop...

1149
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:38,440
...I'm seeing that reading specialist
this afternoon.

1150
01:17:39,010 --> 01:17:44,110
Look. We'll study in school,
after school, whatever it takes.

1151
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:47,980
But we need a teacher.
What do you say, Mr. Shoop?

1152
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:52,890
Please?

1153
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:03,830
How can I say no
to these cute little faces?

1154
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:26,810
Your practice test scores were great.
Hey, come on,

1155
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:29,320
you been here 12 hours.
I want you to go home,

1156
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,290
forget about this test,
get a good night's sleep.

1157
01:19:32,490 --> 01:19:35,220
I'll see you tomorrow,
8 AM, the lecture hall.

1158
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:39,370
Hey, trust me. Come on, you're gonna
kick ass and take names. Believe it.

1159
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:42,730
- Are we really that ready?
- Ready? What time's the test?

1160
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:46,130
- Eight AM.
- See, the correct answers do not stop.

1161
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:48,330
Now, go on, get out of here,
all of you,

1162
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:52,840
before the college recruiters show up
and try to drag you all off to Harvard.

1163
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:55,920
Hey, I mean it.

1164
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:16,630
Wondermutt, look. I found Bob.

1165
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:21,570
Go get it.

1166
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:52,070
Yeah!

1167
01:20:58,150 --> 01:21:00,610
- Morning, Mom.
- Morning, sweetheart.

1168
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:02,870
Morning, Dad.

1169
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:06,180
How do you want your eggs, honey?
Fried, scrambled?

1170
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:09,720
I don't know.

1171
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,420
- What are eggs?
- I'll surprise you.

1172
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:14,820
How do you spell "cat"?

1173
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:20,860
- I don't know!
- Honey, what's wrong?

1174
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:24,470
I don't know what's wrong.
Every... Everything's blank.

1175
01:21:24,670 --> 01:21:27,660
I don't know anything.
I don't know anything!

1176
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:29,780
I don't know anything!

1177
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,810
Chainsaw! Chainsaw! Chainsaw!

1178
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:34,680
Are you all right?

1179
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,280
- I had a nightmare.
- About what?

1180
01:21:38,490 --> 01:21:40,110
I don't know.

1181
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,350
- Great day for a test, huh?
- Yeah.

1182
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,550
Hey, Shoop.

1183
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:49,150
- An apple.
- For the teacher.

1184
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,300
Give them hell.

1185
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:55,570
- Hey, we're testing in here.
- I know, I'm in your class.

1186
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:00,330
I remember you.
Where you been?

1187
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:02,570
Bathroom.

1188
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:05,910
- Six weeks?
- My zipper got stuck.

1189
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:12,910
"Do not open the test booklets
until you are told to do so.

1190
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:17,090
"Using a number two pencil, take your
answer sheet and fill in your name.

1191
01:22:17,290 --> 01:22:21,920
"Last name first, first name second,
middle initial last on the first line.

1192
01:22:22,130 --> 01:22:23,650
"Do this now."

1193
01:22:24,570 --> 01:22:28,400
This officer is here to see
that there is no cheating.

1194
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:32,830
This officer is here to see
that there is no cheating.

1195
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:38,410
Festival of screwups and their king.

1196
01:22:39,710 --> 01:22:43,710
Mr. Gills extends his warmest
personal regards and best wishes.

1197
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,350
Hey, thanks for caring, man.

1198
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:49,790
OK. Break the seals
on your test booklets now.

1199
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:54,190
And turn to the section titled
Reading Vocabulary.

1200
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:58,130
"You will have 20 minutes
to complete this section."

1201
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,730
Everybody ready?

1202
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:04,730
No!

1203
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,440
Tension breaker, had to be done.

1204
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:13,210
Anybody else?

1205
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:19,110
Good luck, gang.

1206
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:22,050
Ready.

1207
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:24,380
Begin.

1208
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:34,960
Sorry.

1209
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:37,550
Kevin.

1210
01:25:40,230 --> 01:25:41,750
It's starting.

1211
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:43,620
Now?

1212
01:25:43,830 --> 01:25:45,390
Shit.

1213
01:25:46,030 --> 01:25:47,520
How far apart?

1214
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,130
Twelve minutes.

1215
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:51,860
Try and slow it down.

1216
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:55,270
Forget about the...

1217
01:26:07,990 --> 01:26:10,750
- Thirty seconds left.
- Come on, come on.

1218
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,790
C, C,

1219
01:26:13,090 --> 01:26:17,160
C, C, C,

1220
01:26:18,030 --> 01:26:21,260
C, C, C, C.

1221
01:26:21,870 --> 01:26:24,030
- And...
- Wait 20 more seconds.

1222
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:27,070
- Twenty seconds.
...stop. Pencils down.

1223
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,440
C, C, C.

1224
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:31,600
Drop them!

1225
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:35,210
Stay seated until Anna-Maria
picks up your tests.

1226
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:38,940
Miss Mazarelli, may I have those tests
after you collect them, please?

1227
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:41,880
- Yeah.
- Can Rhonda and I be excused?

1228
01:26:42,090 --> 01:26:44,150
She's having a baby.

1229
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:46,880
- She's having a baby?
- Oh, I wanna see this.

1230
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:50,660
Calm down! Everybody just stay
in your seats. No problem here at all.

1231
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:52,800
Rhonda, why didn't
you say something?

1232
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,300
- I wanted to finish my test.
- You need hot water, a ride?

1233
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,770
- All we need is a hospital.
- What can I do?

1234
01:26:58,970 --> 01:27:00,770
- Get out of my way.
- I can do that.

1235
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:04,570
Carmine, get out of her way!
Get the door.

1236
01:27:06,510 --> 01:27:09,810
- Save the umbilical cord.
- And the afterbirth, if convenient.

1237
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:11,850
Good thinking.

1238
01:27:12,450 --> 01:27:14,250
Oh, easy, easy, this way. Watch out.

1239
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:18,490
- You look terrific.
- Well, I'm feeling pretty good.

1240
01:27:18,690 --> 01:27:20,290
That's great.

1241
01:27:20,490 --> 01:27:23,400
The baby is healthy and happy.

1242
01:27:23,830 --> 01:27:26,320
And my coach was incredible.

1243
01:27:26,530 --> 01:27:29,370
Yeah, well, I couldn't
have done it without you.

1244
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:31,830
No cord, huh?

1245
01:27:33,110 --> 01:27:35,200
When do we get to see
the whippersnapper?

1246
01:27:35,410 --> 01:27:38,140
Rhonda, don't let those two
near the baby, please.

1247
01:27:39,550 --> 01:27:42,110
Well, it won't be a problem.

1248
01:27:42,850 --> 01:27:45,340
I'm giving her up for adoption.

1249
01:27:47,690 --> 01:27:51,250
- She's going to a really good home.
- That's nice.

1250
01:27:51,890 --> 01:27:53,590
I'm not ready to be a mom.

1251
01:27:58,570 --> 01:28:00,830
- Mr. Shoop.
- Ciao.

1252
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,560
Ciao, gang. How's it going?

1253
01:28:03,270 --> 01:28:04,740
- All right.
- OK.

1254
01:28:07,940 --> 01:28:09,670
Bad news?

1255
01:28:11,110 --> 01:28:13,510
Gills says he's mailing you
your scores.

1256
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:16,780
- We failed.
- He just said the average grade

1257
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:19,150
- was below passing.
- So we failed.

1258
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:22,120
Hey, you didn't fail.

1259
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,380
I failed.

1260
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:31,000
Field trips to the beach, a bed in your
classroom, drinking at the beach,

1261
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:34,570
a screening of
Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1.

1262
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,860
- Quite a summer, Mr. Shoop.
- I tried to keep it interesting.

1263
01:28:38,070 --> 01:28:41,270
I have his dismissal
ready for your signature, sir.

1264
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:43,240
Before I sign anything,

1265
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:47,470
I understand there are some people
waiting to speak in Mr. Shoop's behalf.

1266
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:50,910
- Really?
- Come in.

1267
01:28:51,390 --> 01:28:55,150
Mr. Kelban, you're not actually
going to listen to these delinquents?

1268
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:58,760
No. I'm gonna listen to their parents.

1269
01:29:12,070 --> 01:29:14,230
I'm Principal Kelban.

1270
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:18,140
- Is there a spokesperson here?
- I guess I am. I'm Howard Gremp.

1271
01:29:18,580 --> 01:29:20,600
You're Chainsaw's father.

1272
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:23,910
- Interesting boy.
- No, you can say it. He's a lunatic.

1273
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:25,590
Dad.

1274
01:29:25,790 --> 01:29:29,150
You know, six weeks ago, I thought
he had the IQ of a salad bar.

1275
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:32,380
His only interest in life
was to make people sick.

1276
01:29:32,590 --> 01:29:37,220
If my mother came to dinner, he would
give the dog a third eye or an extra leg.

1277
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:40,520
Because of him,
we stopped having kids.

1278
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:44,760
I mean, you can imagine the feeling
when I saw him studying.

1279
01:29:44,970 --> 01:29:47,770
The wife and I almost burst into tears.

1280
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:50,840
- David was doing his homework too.
- It makes sense,

1281
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:52,480
they share the same brain.

1282
01:29:52,850 --> 01:29:56,250
Not only did Mr. Shoop
get my daughter to read,

1283
01:29:56,450 --> 01:29:57,680
he taught her to drive.

1284
01:29:57,890 --> 01:30:01,220
He showed Kevin there's more to life
than just football.

1285
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:06,490
- I'm not sure I agree, but it's possible.
- This man should not be teaching.

1286
01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:10,030
Proof is here in these test results.
Look for yourself, Mr. Shoop.

1287
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:14,660
Passing is 70.
Average score here was 63.

1288
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:19,700
- They failed.
- That is not true, Mr. Gills.

1289
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:21,770
- We passed?
- No, not all of you.

1290
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:24,340
But that's not what's important here.

1291
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:25,810
Larry.

1292
01:30:26,010 --> 01:30:30,140
Went from an 18 to a 51!

1293
01:30:30,350 --> 01:30:32,750
If I'd only seen you strip
a week sooner. You!

1294
01:30:32,950 --> 01:30:34,680
- Mom, my hair.
- Rhonda.

1295
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:39,120
From a 29 to a 43
and she gave birth.

1296
01:30:39,330 --> 01:30:42,690
Isn't childbirth
grounds for a makeup test?

1297
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,860
It always has been.

1298
01:30:46,330 --> 01:30:47,930
This woman thing never fails.

1299
01:30:48,370 --> 01:30:52,500
Eakian. A 51 to a 74.

1300
01:30:53,410 --> 01:30:56,430
I passed!
I am an Eakian, Grams.

1301
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:58,240
- All right, Eaker.
- Denise.

1302
01:30:58,450 --> 01:31:02,400
No previous test score because
you ditched every test, but a 38.

1303
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:05,740
- Honey, that's terrific.
- We'll get them next time.

1304
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:07,480
- Kevin.
- Yeah?

1305
01:31:07,690 --> 01:31:10,710
From a 48 to a 75!

1306
01:31:10,930 --> 01:31:12,550
Yeah! I'm back on the team!

1307
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:16,530
- Yeah! Kill!
- Yeah! Kill!

1308
01:31:20,530 --> 01:31:25,600
Chainsaw. Last score was a 6.
This time, 59. Monster comeback.

1309
01:31:25,810 --> 01:31:27,670
- All right.
- And Dave.

1310
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,740
From a 26 to a 70.

1311
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:31,240
I passed!

1312
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:32,780
- You made it!
- You passed?

1313
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:36,180
You passed and I failed, asshole!
How could you do that to me?

1314
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:39,880
It was an accident.
I'll take it again. I can fail, I know it.

1315
01:31:40,090 --> 01:31:45,020
And Pam went from a 53 to an 82.

1316
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:48,060
- Was that the highest?
- Well, almost.

1317
01:31:48,260 --> 01:31:51,560
I mean, that guy who spent six weeks
in the bathroom got a 91.

1318
01:31:51,770 --> 01:31:55,220
But look, there's more going on here
than test scores and grades.

1319
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,400
You all worked hard
and you improved.

1320
01:31:57,640 --> 01:32:00,070
And that's very nice, Mr. Shoop.

1321
01:32:00,270 --> 01:32:03,710
We are here to discuss
his flagrant violation of school policies.

1322
01:32:03,910 --> 01:32:05,670
Hold it, Gills.

1323
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:10,840
According to my numbers,

1324
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:14,420
the average scores here
increased from 28 to 63.

1325
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:17,280
That's 125 percent improvement.
Now, that's teaching.

1326
01:32:17,490 --> 01:32:19,080
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

1327
01:32:19,290 --> 01:32:22,190
Mr. Shoop, I'm granting you tenure.

1328
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:27,060
He's back, ladies and gentlemen!

1329
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:50,080
This is the last time I ask. I promise.

1330
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:53,220
Will you have dinner with me?

1331
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:56,330
I'll think about it.

1332
01:32:59,130 --> 01:33:01,800
Can I use some of that lip stuff?

1333
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:23,580
Does this mean we can
have dinner tonight?

1334
01:33:23,790 --> 01:33:26,190
