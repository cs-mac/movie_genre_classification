[Man Narrating]
This is the village of Putnam's Landing...

2
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:56,240
Iocated some 50 miles north of
New York City on Long Island Sound.

3
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,648
Rich in history and tradition...

4
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,551
Putnam's Landing
was founded in 1628...

5
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,816
by one Samuel Putnam.

6
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,984
There is very little to be said
about Samuel Putnam...

7
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,961
as the day he landed,
he was scalped.

8
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:13,590
It was the last really interesting thing
that happened in Putnam's Landing...

9
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,725
for more than 300 years.

10
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,270
- This is the crack commuting train...
- [Horn Blaring]

11
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:21,000
The 5:29 from Grand Central.

12
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,668
It makes its run
in an hour and 10 minutes.

13
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:26,371
These are the happy commuters.

14
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:30,212
In the last five years,
these contented country dwellers...

15
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:33,775
have made 1,250 round-trips.

16
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,083
That means they have each
wasted a total...

17
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:41,617
of 2,920 and two-third man-hours
aboard this train.

- Hey!
- Here you are, sir.

21
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,502
Pass one of those back here, will ya?

22
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,335
Make it a double.
It's gettin' late.

23
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:06,508
Hey, hey.
I'll settle for a single, straight.

24
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,449
Thank you.
I'm very grateful.

[Chattering]

26

Hi, Angela.

32
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,698
Say, you haven't seen Grace
around here anyplace, have you?

33
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,932
No.
Have you seen my Oscar?

34
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,407
No. Well, he wasn't on
the bar car anyway.

35
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:08,140
Well, if he wasn't on the bar car,
he wasn't on the train.

36
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,047
Yes. You have a point there, yes.

No, honey, it-

40
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,928
No, uh, it's just that
Danny swallowed something.

41
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,061
Fortunately, the plumber's here.

42
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,935
Um- Honey, look,
there's a lot going on.

43
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,874
Do you suppose
you could take a cab just this once?

44
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,877
All right.

45
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:46,942
- Everything all right?
- No. Grace got tied up.
She wants me to take a cab.

46
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,818
Oh, that's all right.
I'll drop you.

47
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,914
Look. No meter.

48
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,982
Well, thanks.

49
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:08,238
- Oh, I'm sorry. Can I make an observation?
- Yes.

50
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:12,267
What is that devastating
perfume you have on?

51
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:15,439
- Pink Boudoir.
- Well- [Italian]

52

- Now may I make an observation?
- Go right ahead.

53
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,709
That is sweeter than anything my husband
has said to me since we've been married.

54
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:25,656
I'll remember it as I sit alone tonight
getting loaded.

55
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:29,217
Gee, I wonder why Grace couldn't meet me.
Probably something got clogged.

56
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:32,162
Oh, think positively.
The trouble with you is...

57
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,927
you should've had
a couple more drinks on the train.

58
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,162
[Chuckles]
I didn't have a drop.

59
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:40,171
- Why?
- Well- [Chuckles]

60
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,867
It's a long story
with an unhappy ending.

61
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:46,309
Oscar always has a couple of drinks
on the train...

62
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,677
to brace himself
so he can face me, I guess.

63
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,773
Oh, I don't know about that.

64
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,614
But I have a couple of doubles because
the way I look at it is that...

65
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,122
he is twice as hard to face as I am.

66
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,387
Not that I miss him,
but I wonder what happened to him.

67
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,519
I don't know.
Guys in television...

68
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,029
are always going off
somewhere unexpectedly.

69
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,032
Mmm.
One of these days...

70
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,364
I'm going to go off
somewhere unexpectedly.

71
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,903
- Oh, yeah?
- To Reno, Nevada.

72
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:15,270
Of course, the sad part is
I don't really want a divorce.

73
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:18,105
I mean, I like being married.

74
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,907
[Sighs]
I just don't like being married to Oscar.

75
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,711
Actually, Grace is a remarkable girl.

76
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,617
Actually, Oscar is kind of a poop.

77
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:31,783
No. The whole problem is there
just aren't any eligible bachelors...

78
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,827
in Putnam's Landing.

79
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,489
Of course, the joint is absolutely
jumping with married men.

80
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,964
I could pick off any one of them-

81

I'm very happy indeed. Oh!

If l- lf, uh-
If someone were unhappy...

87
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,146
you could certainly make 'em happy.

Don't you think you'd better
watch where you're going?

91
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,695
Um, no, l-As I was saying,
there's no question about it.

92
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,702
I mean, if-if, um-

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,036
If I weren't as happy as I am, uh-

94
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,099
I mean, there wouldn't be
any question about it.

95
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:29,240
You could, uh, make me-
You know what I mean?

96
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:36,287
Oh. Oh, I didn't mean anything, uh-

make a note to get some more whiskey?

you turn off that television set...

Now, where were you
on Monday when I came home?

146
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:30,123
Monday was den mothering it in the woods
with a pack of other people's mistakes...

147
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,221
and I had cold scraps from Sunday.

was the meeting for the Committee...

[Chuckles]

153
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:51,474
I get the chills every time
I think of dinner at home.

154
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,678
So now you think it's wrong for me
to take an interest in my community, hmm?

155
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,780
No, no, an interest is fine.
Honey, this town...

156
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,325
has got more committees
than the United Nations.

157
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,258
You seem to be
on every one of them.

158
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,229
We had more homelife before
we were married, Grace Oglethorpe.

159
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:08,289
And now you're attacking me
for doing my civic duty!

160
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,801
No. Civic duty's fine up to a point.
Up to a point.

161
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,100
But you've gone beyond that point.

162
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:17,734
Honey, you're not a conscientious citizen
anymore. You're a conscientious sucker.

163
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,268
Thank you very much.

164
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,542
We had a fellow in the office
had a wife just like you-

165
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,550
committees, committees, committees.

166
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,609
You know what he did?

167
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:33,248
He went out and he found himself
a little homelife away from home.

168
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,657
She was a rare beauty too.

169
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:39,425
Where did you see her?

170
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,864
He showed me her picture.

171
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:45,461
All right.
All right, Harry Bannerman.

172
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:49,770
If that's what you want, you go out
and you find yourself some little floozy...

173
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,538
and you see if-

174
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:55,011
[Sobbing]

175
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,811
Honey!

176
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,908
[Sobbing Continues]

177
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,919
Will you-

178
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:10,621
Darling, I don't want that.
I couldn't afford it even if I did-

179
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:13,358
Darling, I want you.
I love you.

180
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:17,163
And I love you too.
So why are we fighting?

181
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,603
Because when I come home, I'd like-

182
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,607
[Chuckles]
I don't know.

183
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:27,806
[Sniffles] Harry, how would you like
to go away for a couple of days?

184
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,476
- Me, alone?
- Oh, no, honey. I mean both of us.

185
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,781
Honey, you mean that?

186
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,448
Of course I mean it.

187
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:41,220
Oh, now you're talkin'.
Now you're really talkin'.

188
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:45,730
I'll get that babysitter in, and I'll get
Sid Harris to take over at the office for me.

189
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,925
- I got a great idea.
- What?

190
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,662
We'll go to New York.
We'll get us a suite at the St. Regis Hotel.

191
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,897
Oh, that's a divine idea!

192
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,963
Can we have breakfast in bed?

193
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,565
Ooh, can we have breakfast in bed!

194
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:00,806
And lunch in bed,
and dinner in bed.

195
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,745
Maybe even a midmorning snack in bed.

196
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,215
Hey!
Look, if we leave right now-

197
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,514
Honey, we can't leave now.

198
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:12,255
- Why not?
- Because there's a town meeting.

199
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,622
- Oh, so what? Skip it.
- Well, darling, I would love to.

200
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:18,424
But Betty O'Sheels garbage plant comes up
for a vote, and I swore to her we'd be there.

201
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:22,661
Well, can't we send proxies?
I mean, that's only garbage.

202
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:26,831
Oh, honey, I'm on her committee.
She needs my moral support.

203
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:30,842
Well, I need your support too, honey,
moral and otherwise.

204
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,504
Well, how about tomorrow?

205
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:37,572
I don't know if I can restrain myself
until tomorrow.

206
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,346
Then you'll just have
to make the effort.

207
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:43,217
Okay.

208
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,849
Tomorrow.

209
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,859
- Honey?
- Hmm?

210
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,327
- I can't make it tomorrow either.
- Why not?

211
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,694
I've called a meeting
of my Pageant Committee.

212
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:57,065
Is it that time
of the year again already?

213
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,765
Now, Harry, you know
what my pageant means to the town.

214
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,536
Well, what would they do
on the Fourth ofJuly without it?

215
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,543
They might enjoy themselves.

216
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,841
You think it's any fun sitting
up there in those bleachers...

217
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:11,076
watching George Washington...
dripping sweat...

218
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,914
when he's supposed to be
freezing to death at Valley Forge?

219
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:17,513
Well, this year,
I've decided to do something different-

220
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,650
something... bigger and better.

221
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,557
Like what?

222
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,290
I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.

223
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:29,664
Well, have you decided that
we can definitely go on Saturday?

224
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,669
Harry Bannerman,
where is your mind?

225
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,967
- Saturday's your son's birthday.
- Which one?

226
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,974
- Harry Bannerman!
- Well, I got a right to know.

227
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,976
Well, it's Danny's.

228
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,512
What about Sunday? Hmm?
I love Sunday in New York.

229
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,243
- Sunday's the birthday party.
- I thought you said the birthday was on Saturday?

230
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,285
Well, the birthday's Saturday,
but, you see...

231
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,787
Dickie Sutphen and Billy Nye
have a dancing lesson on Saturday...

232
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,449
so we decided to switch
the birthday party on Sunday.

233
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:56,255
Well, for $64,000,
why can't you make it Monday?

234
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,728
- Well, we can.
- We can?

235
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:01,129
If you wanna take Peter with us.

236
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,294
Honey-
Now, l-I love our firstborn...

237
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,304
as though he were human...

238
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:09,136
but why do we have to take that little
monster with us on our second honeymoon?

239
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:13,668
Because Monday's the day you take
Peter in to get his bite plate fitted.

240
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,909
Oh, yeah, his bite plate.

241
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:19,610
[Sighs]
Just one last damaging question.

242
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:22,916
Since you knew all along that we were
never gonna be able to make it...

243
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,821
why did you tantalize me
by bringing it up in the first place?

244
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:29,588
Oh, it's not all my fault.

245
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,653
I love you.

246
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,292
And I love you too...

247
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,730
from afar.

248
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:42,273
And someday, someday...

249
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:46,607
when Dickie Sutphen and Billy Nye
have learned to dance...

250
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,206
and- and they found a new driver
for the bloodmobile...

251
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,046
and- and they haven't
formed that committee...

252
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,586
that you'll have to form
the women's auxiliary of...

253
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:58,122
and- and medical science
has found a cure...

254
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,523
for these
mentally retarded do-gooders-

255
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,527
[Sighs]
Someday-

256
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,029
Someday, Grace Bannerman...

257
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,362
mark my words...

258
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:11,164
I'll get you yet.

259
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,733
All right.

260
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:20,307
[Narrator] If Harry Bannerman
believes that his life is complicated now...

261
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,472
- he should only know that at this very moment...
- [Phone Ringing]

262
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:26,279
Angela Hoffa is doing a bit
of conniving on her own.

263
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,380
But wait. I'm getting
a little ahead of myself.

264
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,391
Let's see who's calling.

265
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,893
Yeah?
Well, what I said still goes.

266
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:39,556
- [Buzzing]
- Yeah?

267
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:43,465
Who? Mrs. Hoffa?
That's my wife. Tell her to hang on.

268
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,503
[Woman]
I'm sorry. He's on another line.

269
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,664
Oh, he's on another line?
Well, all right. I'll wait.

270
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,470
I've got nothing else to do
but stand here and shiver and drip.

271
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:56,807
Who? Oh, all right.
Put her on. Angela, what do you want?

272
00:16:56,882 --> 00:17:00,045
[Sighs]
What do I want?

273
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:05,955
Oh, I don't know.
Love, power, immortality.

274
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,654
What's the matter with you? Are you loaded?
Now, what is it you want? I'm busy.

275
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,720
I hate to remind you
that you called me.

276
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,825
But while you're on, I was just
wondering in my naive, girlish way...

277
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:18,836
why you weren't on the 5:29?

278
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:22,465
How should I know
why I wasn't on the 5:29?

279
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,408
Oh, here it is in black and white.
I'm flying to Hollywood tonight.

280
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:29,311
Didn't they tell you? Of course I gotta go.
How do I know why? I'm goin'.

281
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,714
Let's keep it gay, Oscar.
Let's close with a laugh.

282
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:36,653
And here's the biggest laugh
of the evening: I'll miss you!

283
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,122
Angela, I don't get it.

284
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,834
Ping.

285
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:54,836
No, of course not, Angela.
No, it's no trouble at all.

286
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:59,708
Angela, what good is it to be neighbors
if we're not gonna be neighborly?

287
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,008
Yeah.
All right, in half an hour.

288
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,015
Bye.

289
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,917
That was Angela Hoffa calling. She wants us
to pick her up on the way to the meeting...

290
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,955
'cause it seems that
Oscar is off to Hollywood again.

291
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:14,550
I don't know how they live together.
They never see each other.

292
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:16,617
Harry?

293
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,622
Harry, how long have you
been seeing imaginary movies?

294
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,726
- On the back of my eyelids.
- On the back of your eyelids.

295
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,737
- Since you were six?
- Five.

296
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,035
I've told you a million times.

297
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,269
When I was a kid,
they were mostly Westerns.

298
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:36,713
But then around 10,
things kind of changed.

299
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:41,219
Harry Bannerman in Red Dust.

300
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,278
With Jean Harlow.

301
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:48,122
Of course, in- in my version,
I took her away from Clark Gable...

302
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:52,630
which was quite a trick considering
that I was only three feet tall.

303
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:55,861
You know, I've been discussing this
with Sally Stengel's brother.

304
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:58,027
He thinks it's
a definite neurotic symptom.

305
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:01,630
- It's a gift.
- Not according to Sally Stengel's brother.

306
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,732
However, he says
it really isn't serious...

307
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,073
and he can probably stop it
in six weeks' therapy.

308
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,114
Stop it?
Honey, it saved my life a thousand times.

309
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:13,618
Town meetings, P.T.A., lectures...

310
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:16,779
and often when we have company.

311
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:21,189
And may I ask what's playing at
the Harry Bannerman Theater tonight?

312
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,421
[Harry]
It's a movie I created myself.

313
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,963
And I can twist it any way I want.

314
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:29,023
Harry, beloved, I have traveled
halfway round the globe...

315
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,092
to tell you
I'm ready to make amends.

316
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,662
No more committees,
no more outside activities.

317
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,370
I am ready to spend
all my waking hours making you happy.

318
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:43,107
You are my life, my love, my all...

319
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,650
and I'm ready to prove it.

320
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:48,550
Darling, what more can I say...

321
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,056
after I say "I'm ready"?

322
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:02,330
Harry Bannerman, I'm ready.!

323
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,392
Mm-hmm.

324
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:09,801
- Harry!
- Grace, let's skip the meeting and stay home.

325
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,036
- Grace, I love you.
- I love you too, but you're messing me up!

326
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,806
- Well?
- Honey, we gotta go to the meeting.

327
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,008
- We can't stay here?
- [Chuckling] No.

328
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,951
Okay. Okay, tonight's the town meeting,
and tomorrow's the pageant.

329
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,454
Saturday is Danny's birthday, but Dickie Sutphen
and Billy Nye have gotta learn how to dance...

330
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,457
so they can't have
the birthday party until Sunday.

331
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,050
On Monday, you gotta take Peter and have
his bite plate fixed. But on Tuesday-

332
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:33,257
On Tuesday, you and I
are checking in to the St. Regis Hotel...

333
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,823
come rain, snow or gloom of night.

334
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,835
[Chuckling]

335
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,838
Now, we may get there a little late
for breakfast in bed, but we'll be there-

336
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,840
- We'll get there in time for lunch?
- In bed.

337
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,934
- Is that a date?
- Yes.

338
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,411
Next Tuesday at the St. Regis
no matter what?

339
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,916
All right, you great big lovable,
overgrown boy.

340
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:56,080
You have a date at the St. Regis
next Tuesday no matter what.

341
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:01,486
Let me up!
We gotta go!

342
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,256
Come on!
Come on.

343
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,957
Let's go in and take
a peek at the kids, hmm?

344
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,942
[Girl]
Cinderella's sisters are two real cubes...

345
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:23,709
but, uh, her fairy godmother
digs the action the most.

346
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,716
"Oh, you wanna go to the ball?"
She asked.

347
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,911
"Crazy, dad,"
Cinderella says.

348
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:32,480
And wham, bam, alakazam,
that no-talent pumpkin...

349
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:38,518
suddenly turns into
a four-passenger T-Bird.

350
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:42,260
And off they go to have themselves
a ball. Dig it?

351
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,268
- The most.
- The most.

352
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:47,237
At least our kids
are learning a foreign language.

353
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,104
Oh, you just don't dig it.
You're getting old.

354
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:53,576
I am, huh?
Just wait until Tuesday.

355
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,215
Before going on,
I should like to pause briefly...

356
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:02,242
to examine some of the broader aspects
of garbage disposal.

357
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:07,554
We must face the fact that
garbage disposal-wise...

358
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:11,153
new vistas, new dimensions...

359
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:15,632
new horizons
are daily being opened unto us.

360
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:19,034
Even a superficial glance
at the facts reveals...

361
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,504
that there are not one...

362
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:26,010
but three basic methods
of garbage disposal.

363
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:41,222
I have brought a loaf of bread,
a jug of wine.

364
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:45,821
All I need is thou... now!

365
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,033
We must stand together.
And I am very pleased to report...

366
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,045
- that if we stand together...
- [No Audible Dialogue]

367
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:04,310
We can acquire the perfect
location for this plant-

368
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,580
the old Yarboro property
on Shore Road.

369
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,953
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

370
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:18,257
I own the old Yarboro property, and you're
not gonna get it for a- for a garbage plant.

371
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,298
Mr. Crummitt, may l-

372
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:23,027
Now, let's save some words,
Mr. Moderator.

373
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,831
You're going to ask me,
"Why not?"

374
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,668
And I'm going to tell you
I've sold it.

375
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,402
And you're gonna ask me
who bought it...

376
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:34,240
and I'm gonna tell you who-

377
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,246
the United States Army.

378
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:37,906
- [Woman] What?
- [Murmuring]

379
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,816
Why is the army moving into
a peaceful little village like this?

380
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,854
What about our daughters?

381
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,219
Our daughters
have been gently reared.

382
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,656
What'll happen to
these pure, innocent girls...

383
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:50,627
when the town is filled
with soldiers?

384
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:54,859
- Mr. Crummitt-
- I knew you were gonna get back to me.

385
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:59,370
Now, you're going to ask me, "What does
the army want with that property?"

386
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,874
And I'm going to tell you
word for word-

387
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:07,071
verbatim-
exactly what they told me- nothing!

388
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,340
- Top secret.
- [Man] Atom bombs!

389
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,348
- [Murmuring]
- The whole town might blow up!

390
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:16,513
Order, please. We must have order.
His Honor has the floor.

391
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,648
Fellow citizens, as your mayor,
I can safely say...

392
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:23,558
that our town faces the greatest crisis
since Samuel Putnam was scalped.

393
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,562
- [Murmuring]
- Absolutely!

394
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,599
Are we going to sit by and
be calmly blasted into kingdom come?

395
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,601
[All]
No!

396
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,137
Let's forget all this
silly talk about garbage...

397
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:36,174
and get on to the important problem
we've got ahead of us.

398
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:39,108
We've gotta keep this top secret
out of Putnam's Landing.

399
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:42,237
Bravo!

400
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:47,943
[Woman] Mr. Moderator,
I move that we form a committee right now.

401
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:52,149
The Women's Safety Committee
for the Protection of Putnam's Landing.

402
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:56,024
And as chairman of that committee,
I would like to nominate...

403
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:59,063
the most public-spirited citizen
it has ever been my honor to know-

404
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,995
Mrs. Harry Bannerman.!

405
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,057
[Cheering]

406
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:14,103
No, you're swearing off, remember?

407
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,170
But they need me.

408
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:31,887
Ladies and gentlemen,
friends and neighbors...

409
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,659
fellow citizens...

410
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:37,725
I am humbly grateful
for this great honor...

411
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,997
this chairmanship of the-

412
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:42,266
- What was that name?
- Women's Safety Committee.

413
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,274
The Women's Safety Committee...

414
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,276
- for the Protection of Public's-
- For the Protection of Putnam's Landing.

415
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:48,812
Putnam's Landing, yes.
Thank you.

416
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,782
Now, of course, we're all aware
that we have to act quickly.

417
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:56,480
So I move that we appoint a spokesman
to go to Washington...

418
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:01,754
and tell whoever's in charge that they will
have to move their top secret someplace else!

419
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:04,420
Who has the public
relations experience...

420
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:07,590
the strength and the courage
to put the Pentagon in its place...

421
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:10,794
and convince them that
we mean to fight this-this-

422
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,837
whatever it is
no matter what the consequences?

423
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:16,271
For this vital mission,
I appoint...

424
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:19,708
none other than my husband,
Harry Bannerman.!

425
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:22,542
- [Cheering]
- [Man] I second it.!

426
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:26,448
Motion has been made and seconded
to appoint Mr. Bannerman spokesman.

427
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,509
- All those in favor.
- [All] Aye!

428
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,078
- Opposed?
- Nay.

429
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,090
[Mr. Moderator]
Motion is carried. Mr. Bannerman...

430
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,319
how soon can you be ready
to go to Washington?

431
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,827
Oh, he can be ready to go on Monday.
Can't you, Harry?

432
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:40,490
Mmm.
Peter's bite plate.

433
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:43,557
I forgot about that.
Then you can go next Tuesday.

434
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:47,730
No- No, next Tuesday
is definitely out of the question.

435
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:51,537
- Why?
- Well, I'll tell you why. My wife and I are-

436
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,703
Harry, please.

437
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,905
He'll be glad to go,
Mr. Moderator.

438
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:58,381
Good.
Well, that's it.

439
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,690
[Narrator]
Grace immediately called a meeting...

440
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:10,125
of the Women's Safety Committee
for the Protection of Putnam's Landing.

441
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,561
So poor Harry took Angela home.

442
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:17,591
And that's how Harry got his first drink,
and his second, third and fourth.

443
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:22,663
On reaching his fifth, Angela decided
to get into something more comfortable.

444
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,868
[Spraying]

445
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:26,911
What's on your mind, Harry?

446
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:31,381
[Snickers]
I'd rather not say.

447
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,349
Well, give me a little hint.

448
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,580
That's a-That's a devastating outfit
you have on, Angela.

449
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,456
I'm glad you like it.

450
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:49,097
[Spraying]

451
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,136
Grace, uh-
Grace used to have a devastating outfit.

452
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:54,137
- Oh?
- Yeah, when we were first married...

453
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:56,571
she had this, uh-
she had this pink peignoir.

454
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,575
Mmm!

455
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,577
That's a transparent bathrobe,
only pink.

456
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:03,113
- Mmm. She must have looked
like a living doll.
- Yes, she did.

457
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,944
And, uh,
we were very happy then.

458
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,952
I guess most people are at first.
Well, what happened?

459
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,226
Well, uh, she spilled
cod liver oil on it.

460
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:19,161
- Mmm?
- Yeah, one night right
in the middle of everything...

461
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,495
she suddenly remembered that
she hadn't given Peter his cod liver oil.

462
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,626
Oh, well, that's a shame.

463
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:28,639
I guess a pink peignoir loses its magic
when it has cod liver oil all over it.

464
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:32,803
[Chuckles] Yeah, the cleaners tried,
but it was never the same.

465
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:37,143
She finally gave it to the janitor's wife
and never got another one.

466
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:40,651
I don't know what to say, Harry.

467
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:46,419
Well, of course, that...
made me look kind of silly.

468
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:48,425
Why?

469
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:51,428
Well, you see, I had
this black dressing gown that l-

470
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:56,229
I sort of slipped into it when Grace
slipped in and out of her pink peignoir.

471
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:58,496
[Chuckles]

472
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,800
With the pink peignoir gone,
why, suddenly...

473
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,602
the black dressing gown
didn't mean very much.

474
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,870
She finally gave that
to the janitor.

475
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:09,641
I mean, it must've worked
because within a year, they had twins.

476
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:12,444
I had no idea, Harry.

477
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:15,748
You've led a very tragic life.

478
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,811
Oh, I'm not complaining.
It's just that sometimes...

479
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:20,414
I get this...

480
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:23,256
kind of helpless-

481
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,092
We've both had
quite a bit to drink.

482
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:36,470
[Whispering]
Angela, I think I'd better go home now.

483
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,475
[Whispering]
Why?

484
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:42,946
Grace told you to take me home
and not wait up for her.

485
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:47,474
And the meeting may go on for hours
and hours, so why hurry home?

486
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,383
Hmm.
I don't know.

487
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,854
[Chuckles]

488
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,824
When you get right down to it,
I don't know.

489
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:58,090
Well, ring-a-ding-ding.

if I could just think of something to say.

Well, how about,
"Shall we dance"?

How about that?

May I take off my jacket?

Oh!

- But he's away in Hollywood tonight.
- My roommate's away too.

509
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,238
- Isn't that a coincidence?
- Yes, it is.

510
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:21,335
I wonder if coincidences
have a meaning?

511
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:25,473
- Leads to exciting thinking, doesn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

512
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,418
- Dangerous thinking if we weren't both so strong.
- Yes.

have another drink...

This-This morning when
Grady Metcalf got his motorcycle.

yesterday was his birthday...

a motorcycle if he passed math.

that Grady Metcalf passed math?

All of a sudden...

he didn't seem like
such a serious meatball at all.

- You're getting sharp.

how bewildering it all seems...

L-l-I mean, there's nothin' to it.

605
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,215
You just-
You just gotta remember to-

606
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:05,722
to close your eyes
and breathe through your nose.

607
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:09,988
Close your eyes and
breathe through your nose.

608
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:18,400
There, now, uh, was that so bad?

609
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:20,460
No.

610
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,630
Do you like it?

611
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:27,405
- Yeah.
- Well, okay then!

612
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,804
Mmm! Mmm!

613
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:34,783
- [Gasps]
- [Groans]

614
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,481
[Screams, Gasps]

615
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:45,051
Now, why'd you wanna go and do that for?
L-I thought you liked kissin'.

616
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,063
Oh, I do!

617
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:50,623
L-I just figured it out.
Kissing is wonderful.

618
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:53,602
It's you I can't stand.

619
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,575
[Narrator]
Across the Potomac...

620
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,577
from Washington, D.C.
Stands the Pentagon...

621
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:03,409
mighty nerve center
of our nation's defense...

622
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:08,748
with 171/2 miles of corridors
and 40 snack bars.

623
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:11,652
Do you realize that
this is your first assignment...

624
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:14,520
since the army got rid of its mules?

625
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:18,084
[Both Chuckling]

626
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:20,221
- [Intercom Buzzes]
- Yes?

627
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,425
[Woman]
Mr. Bannerman is here to see you, sir.

628
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,434
Send him in.

629
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,561
Here are the special orders
for your troop detachment.

630
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:30,403
You'll pick them up in Tennessee and
have them in Putnam's Landing by the 27 th.

631
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,908
- Yes, sir.
- [Door Opens]

632
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,469
- Oh.
- How do you do, Mr. Bannerman?

633
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:38,913
I'm General Thorwald.

634
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,917
Oh, yes. How do you do, General?
Pleased to meet you.

635
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,351
- My pleasure. This is Captain Hoxie.
- How do you do, Captain?

636
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:48,757
I've asked him to be present because he'll be
in command of the troops at Putnam's Landing.

637
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:52,762
Now then, Mr. Bannerman,
why don't you tell us what's on your mind.

638
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,890
Oh, yes. Well, um, uh,
the reason I'm here, General, is, uh...

639
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:58,662
I'm in the public relations business,
and I have, uh-

640
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:01,864
Well, I'm alleged to have
a certain persuasiveness-

641
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:04,931
a command of the English language
as it were.

642
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,671
Well, uh, at any rate, uh...

643
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,679
you see, my wife sent me to-

644
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:13,205
I mean, the whole town
sent me down to try to attempt...

645
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:17,152
to dissuade you people
from putting your highly secret, uh...

646
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:21,715
whatever it is thing
in Putnam's Landing.

647
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:25,455
The point is, General, that ours being
a very simple residential community...

648
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,588
why, we-
it's the town's feeling...

649
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:30,657
that this highly-
this thing, whatever it is...

650
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:33,568
will drastically upset
the social equilibrium...

651
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:36,162
and the real estate values
and that sort of thing.

652
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,174
Yes, well,
I hope you understand.

653
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:40,540
Oh, you needn't be embarrassed,
Mr. Bannerman.

654
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:44,240
The army is somewhat accustomed
to experiencing, uh, civilian opposition.

655
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:48,479
What's all this bunk about
social equilibrium and real estate values?

656
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,680
Everybody agrees
we gotta have an army, sure...

657
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:53,690
but not in our town, eh?

658
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:57,159
Oh, no, no, no.
Just put 'em in somebody else's town.

659
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,856
- Wait, Captain. That isn't what-
- Mr. Bannerman, the point is-

660
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,125
The point is that Putnam's Landing
is full of yellow-livered...

661
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,360
money-grubbing,
potbellied feather merchants.

662
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:08,132
If I had my way, I'd line 'em all against the wall
and shoot the whole creepy mess of'em...

663
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:10,833
beginning with you,
you buck-passing civilian.

664
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:14,400
Now, wait a minute, Captain.
I did my part in the last war...

665
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:16,412
and I'm still
in the naval reserve.

666
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,440
Ah! Ah.
A summer vacation sailor, huh?

667
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,453
Serving this nation
on a full-time basis...

668
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:26,115
ain't good enough
for high-class guys like you.

669
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,990
- That's strictly for slobs like
me and the general here, huh?
- Captain Hoxie!

670
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,961
Yeah.

671
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,021
All right, mister.
Okay.

672
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:38,364
We'll save your bacon for you.
We always have, we always will.

673
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,404
But just keep out of our way.

674
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,701
And don't try to stop us
from performing our duty.

675
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,833
Captain Hoxie, that will be all.
Wait outside till I send for you.

676
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,208
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Bannerman-

677
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:52,978
I'll see you in Putnam's Landing,
feather merchant.

678
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,848
Mr. Bannerman,
permit me to apologize.

679
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,912
- [Door Slams Shut]
- Captain Hoxie is a fathead. I mean, he's a hothead.

680
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:01,321
But he's a good soldier.

681
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:03,792
Please, General, uh,
don't apologize to me.

682
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:07,319
I, uh- I mean,
I said what I had to say...

683
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:09,332
but my heart wasn't in it.

684
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,597
I apologize for me, and...

685
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,037
well, I apologize
for Putnam's Landing, and-

686
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,040
Well, mostly
I apologize for my wife...

687
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:21,134
who got me into this preposterous position
to begin with.

688
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:25,205
Now, I don't know what
you're gonna do in Putnam's Landing...

689
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:28,410
and I of course know that the army
is under no obligation to tell me.

690
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:32,582
But whatever I can do up there, General,
for you public relations-wise...

691
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,420
why, you just let me know.

692
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,587
[Chuckles]
And, uh, with that hot fathead-

693
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,596
Uh, to use your own words,
that hot fathead in charge...

694
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,598
you're gonna need plenty of help.

695
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,657
Thank you, Mr. Bannerman.

696
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:47,795
Thank you very much.
Send Captain Hoxie in.

697
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:50,898
Yes, well, thank you, General.
And, remember, if I can be of any help-

698
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:54,411
- I'll call on you.
- Thank you.

699
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,537
- [Thump]
- [Loud Yell]

700
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:01,711
[Chuckles]
Well, good-day.

701
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:12,191
- 412, please.
- We've moved you into a suite, Mr. Bannerman.

702
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,322
- 608.
- What do you mean, you moved me?

703
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:17,196
- Mrs. Bannerman insisted on it.
- Mrs. Bannerman?

704
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,566
That's right.
She checked in about a half hour ago.

705
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:21,571
You mean Mrs. Bannerman
is here in Washington?

706
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,664
She's upstairs waiting
for you right now.

707
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:27,302
No kidding?
How about that Grace?

708
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,903
How about that girl?

709
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:38,153
Hello?
Give me room service, please.

710
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,349
## [Humming]

711
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:42,415
Hello? Uh, this is
Mr. Bannerman speaking.

712
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,927
Would you please send a tray of caviar
and a bottle of champagne...

713
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:47,486
to, uh- to, uh, suite 608?

714
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,534
Yes. Well, just make it, uh...

715
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:53,661
lots and lots of caviar,
service for two, and immediately.

716
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:57,764
Well, I don't care, just as long as it's French
and it's large. Make it a magnum.

717
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,907
[Gasps]

718
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,281
Hello, Harry.

719
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,254
- Where's Grace?
- In Putnam's Landing, I imagine...

720
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,094
doing something noble
and civic-minded.

721
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:03,564
Harry, I'm not going to bite you.

722
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:15,347
[Chuckling]

723
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:19,048
Hadn't you better come in
before a crowd gathers?

724
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:29,464
He said, uh, at the desk
that Mrs. Bannerman had checked in.

725
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:32,627
Well, I suppose I could've registered
as Mrs. Hoffa.

726
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:35,001
But I was afraid eyebrows
might've been raised.

727
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:37,802
You know how provincial
they are in Washington.

728
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,406
What are you doing here anyway?

729
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:44,447
- Lobbying.
- Oh.

730
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:50,449
[Laughing]

731
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,149
I'm sorry, but you look so funny.

732
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:56,852
I really can't tell
whether you're coming or going.

733
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,763
But anyway, here we are...

734
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:04,198
Mr. And Mrs. Harry Bannerman.

735
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:05,895
- Oh.
- Mmm, I like the way that sounds.

736
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:08,199
Yeah, and so does Grace.

737
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:12,709
- Darling, you seem absolutely miserable.
- I am.

738
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:16,803
Look, Angela, we just-
I mean, this is- this is improper.

739
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,973
Why?
We're both married.

740
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,176
[Giggling]

741
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:26,086
Aha. I know what the trouble is.

742
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,751
Remember Pink Boudoir?

743
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:34,787
I wore only one drop the other day,
and you became quite excited.

744
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:37,800
Two drops, they say,
is guaranteed to reduce any man...

745
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:40,701
to a quivering,
whimpering mass of jelly.

746
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:43,171
Angela, please. In that case,
I wouldn't go fooling around with it...

747
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,174
'cause I'm a quivering,
whimpering mass of jelly right now.

748
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:48,837
Oh, but it all seemed
to go together so nicely.

749
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:53,042
Pink perfume, pink peignoir...

750
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:55,051
pink me.

751
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,054
[Giggles]
Oh!

752
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:01,421
Darling, it seems to be stuck.
Here, you try it.

753
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:03,426
Angela, I wouldn't touch that
for a million dollars.

754
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:06,122
Well, darling, we have to get it open.
I have this enormous investment.

755
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:09,427
- Angela, please.
- Oh, well. All right. I'll call the bell captain.

756
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,834
Oh, no! No, no, I'll do it.
[Grunting]

757
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:16,873
You're so strong.
I love a man with powerful hands.

758
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,431
[Banging]

759
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,240
[Grunting]

760
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:25,304
Oh! Darling, are you all right?

761
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:29,011
[Sniffs]
Ooh!

762
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:34,420
Smell the coat.
Just smell it.

763
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:36,425
- I'll have to burn it or something.
- Mmm!

764
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:39,462
That's the only suit I brought-
I'll never be able to go home like this.

765
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,556
It smells delicious.
There's no question about that.

766
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:46,000
Oh, I only wish you'd managed
to get a little of it on me.

767
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:53,304
Well, maybe if we sort of hang it outside
and let the air get to it or something.

768
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:56,244
You won't be needing it
for a while anyway.

769
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:03,219
Mmm! I don't know how
you can resist you.

770
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:06,222
- I know I can't.
- Oh, Angela, please.

771
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,224
[Laughing]

772
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:10,283
What-

773
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:14,430
I won't be able
to go home for a week.

774
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,966
Well, that's all right with me, Harry.

775
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:19,161
Oh, that's very clever.

776
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:23,305
Oh! Sorry.

777
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:28,106
There you are, Black Beauty.

778
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:31,147
You know, if I'd known you were gonna
spend so much time behind that chair...

779
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:33,149
I'd have ordered a smaller suite.

780
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:35,879
[Chuckles]
Angela, you just fracture me.

781
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:39,821
Well!
It certainly is cozy, isn't it?

782
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,688
Say, listen, I, uh-
I don't suppose...

783
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:47,287
you'd be, uh, willing to slip
into something a little less cozy?

784
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:51,960
Oh. Well, don't you like
my pretty, pink peignoir?

785
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,969
I bought it especially for you.

786
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,232
No, it's not that.
It's just that-

787
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:59,742
[Exhales]
Grace used to have a pink kind of-

788
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,675
Darling, I understand perfectly.

789
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:04,578
I'm sure that it will be
a lot better like this.

790
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:07,583
- That's worse.
- [Sighs]

791
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:12,520
Well, Harry,
what else do you suggest?

792
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:16,616
Oh, no.
Angela, take this and go.

793
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:18,752
Okay. Fine!
I'm going!

794
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:21,525
And don't come back
till you're dressed for the street!

795
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:23,532
All right, all right.
Calm down. I'm going.

796
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,864
I'm going.

797
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:29,497
Don't worry, Harry.
I'll think of something.

798
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:51,119
Operator, get me the valet service.

799
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:56,457
Valet service, this is 608.
How long would it take you...

800
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,728
to have a suit
cleaned and pressed?

801
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:01,134
Wait a minute!
Can you fumigate it?

802
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:04,105
Oh. Uh, yes, put it on special,
super special.

803
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:07,075
And beside that, hurry.

804
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:10,580
Operator, uh, this is, uh-
Would you please, uh, call room service...

805
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:12,979
and have them cancel that order
for champagne and caviar to room-

806
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:16,451
- [Doorbell Buzzing]
- Never mind. It's here.

807
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,284
[Giggles]

808
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:30,129
Well, surprise!

809
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,795
Darling, you've won.
I said to myself when you left this morning...

810
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:37,169
"Now, this is the day I promised Harry
we would start our second honeymoon.

811
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,174
"And there he is all by himself.

812
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:42,405
Now, this is cruelty,
not only to him but to me."

813
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,380
So here I am feeling
all lovable and cuddly inside...

814
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:48,179
and ready to make up
for everything.

815
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:50,719
I'm gonna go down
and get a haircut.

816
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:53,051
Honey, like that?

817
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:57,958
Besides, to use your own words,
I don't think I can restrain myself.

818
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:04,126
Why, Harry Bannerman!

819
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:07,102
A suite, no less.

820
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,730
Oh, you knew I was coming.

821
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:12,297
Yes, you did too.

822
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:14,867
Well, honey, don't stare at me
like that. I'm not a ghost.

823
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:18,244
I'm for real,
and I'm here to prove it too.

824
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:21,773
Oh.! Uh- Uh-

825
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,616
You see?
I travel light.

826
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:29,758
- [Chuckles]
- [Sighs]

827
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:33,557
And since you look so comfortable,
I may as well go and get cozy myself.

828
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,928
Oh, uh, Grace, honey,
I just wanna tell you one thing.

829
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:38,695
I love you. I've always loved you
and I always will love you.

830
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,431
But- But right now, Grace,
I love you the absolute most.

831
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:45,441
I don't think a husband in the world could-
could love you as much as I do.

832
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:50,208
- Now, would you believe that?
- Oh, darling, of course I believe you.

833
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,647
- And may I say something?
- What?

834
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:57,778
I'm convinced.
Now, as Cleopatra once said:

835
00:50:57,854 --> 00:51:00,823
"Who takes the shower first, Mark?"

836
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:09,594
Oh, flowers!
Darling, you think of everything.

837
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:11,930
Harry, I've got some clothes on now.!

838
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:24,110
## [Humming Middle Eastern Theme]

839
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:33,117
## [Humming Continues]

840
00:51:52,182 --> 00:51:54,150
Oh, Grace. Grace.
You said you'd believe me.

841
00:51:54,217 --> 00:51:57,118
I had nothing to do with it.
It was a complete surprise.

842
00:51:58,121 --> 00:52:00,521
Your caviar and champagne, sir.

843
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:04,321
You were right, Harry.
It was a complete surprise!

844
00:52:09,866 --> 00:52:12,528
- And then the fairy godmother
touched the pumpkin-
- [Sneezes]

845
00:52:12,602 --> 00:52:15,196
God bless you-
with her magic wand...

846
00:52:15,271 --> 00:52:17,796
and it turned into a coach.

847
00:52:17,874 --> 00:52:20,843
- Mommy, it isn't a coach. It's a T-Bird.
- [Blowing]

848
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:23,879
- Yeah, T-Bird.
- Yeah, you're a cube, Mommy.

849
00:52:26,449 --> 00:52:28,542
I'm sorry, Mommy.

850
00:52:28,618 --> 00:52:33,021
No, it's all right.
You're absolutely right. Mommy is a cube.

851
00:52:34,224 --> 00:52:37,921
Well, run along upstairs
and get ready for bed.

852
00:52:39,863 --> 00:52:42,457
I'll be up to tuck you in later.

853
00:52:45,068 --> 00:52:47,468
- Good night.
- Good night.

854
00:52:50,673 --> 00:52:52,607
[Doorbell Buzzing]

855
00:52:57,747 --> 00:52:59,738
[Sighs]

856
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:03,382
- Grace, before you slam the door-
- Hello, Harry.

857
00:53:03,453 --> 00:53:06,251
Come in.
I'm very glad you came.

858
00:53:06,322 --> 00:53:09,120
You are?
Oh, Grace, that-that's big of you.

859
00:53:09,192 --> 00:53:12,423
Yes, this way you can take your bags
with you. I won't have to send them.

860
00:53:12,495 --> 00:53:14,588
Grace, now-now wait a minute.

861
00:53:14,664 --> 00:53:16,962
There's a very, very simple
logical explanation to all of this.

862
00:53:17,033 --> 00:53:19,866
- I'm sure.
- It's not what you think.
I tried to get away from her.

863
00:53:19,936 --> 00:53:21,870
- But you couldn't.
- No, I couldn't.

864
00:53:21,938 --> 00:53:23,872
- Angela had a gun?
- No, it wasn't that either.

865
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:26,272
- She had an ether cone?
- Honey, I didn't have any pant-

866
00:53:26,342 --> 00:53:28,867
I mean, uh, I wasn't dressed-

867
00:53:28,945 --> 00:53:30,936
Grace, please.
Now, you're making this very difficult.

868
00:53:31,014 --> 00:53:33,778
What did you expect?
A gold watch?

869
00:53:35,418 --> 00:53:40,378
Harry, I have thought this all over,
and it is very clear to me now.

870
00:53:40,457 --> 00:53:44,120
I just don't want to be
married to you anymore.

871
00:53:44,194 --> 00:53:46,128
Grace, now that's ridiculous.

872
00:53:46,196 --> 00:53:48,630
- What are you saying? I love you.
- I can't believe that, Harry.

873
00:53:48,698 --> 00:53:52,293
And if I can't believe that,
then I just can't be your wife anymore.

874
00:53:52,368 --> 00:53:55,496
- You see how-how simple that is?
- Hi, Daddy.

875
00:53:55,572 --> 00:53:57,699
- Hiya, Danny.
- Say good-bye to Daddy, boys.

876
00:53:57,774 --> 00:54:00,641
He's going away on business.

877
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:04,510
- For how long this time?
- Oh, for quite a while.

878
00:54:04,581 --> 00:54:07,482
How long is "Oh, quite a while"?

879
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:10,178
Why, uh, I think
you'll have to ask your mother.

880
00:54:10,253 --> 00:54:12,847
Come on. Say good night to Daddy
and run along upstairs to bed.

881
00:54:12,922 --> 00:54:14,856
Good-bye, kids.
I'll miss you.

882
00:54:14,924 --> 00:54:16,858
- Come on.
- Hey. Come on now.

883
00:54:16,926 --> 00:54:18,951
- Do what your mommy says.
- Good night.

884
00:54:24,234 --> 00:54:28,637
Harry, up until now
I've managed to hold myself together...

885
00:54:28,705 --> 00:54:31,640
but one more minute of this, l-

886
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:33,699
Harry.

887
00:54:35,545 --> 00:54:38,708
[Sniffing]

888
00:54:38,781 --> 00:54:40,772
Oh!

889
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:42,784
- Out. Out. Out.
- What did I do? Oh!

890
00:54:42,852 --> 00:54:46,015
- Out. Out. Out. Out.
- What did I do, Grace?

891
00:54:46,089 --> 00:54:48,819
Harry Bannerman, you stink!

892
00:54:50,126 --> 00:54:52,060
[Crying]

893
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:58,023
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

894
00:55:02,505 --> 00:55:05,804
Gotta have some form of recreation.

895
00:55:13,416 --> 00:55:14,542
[Horn Blaring]

896
00:55:15,418 --> 00:55:19,013
[Narrator] And here is a troop train
heading eastward from Tennessee.

897
00:55:19,088 --> 00:55:25,049
Just a small cog in the big wheel that is
destined to churn Putnam's Landing into chaos.

898
00:55:29,198 --> 00:55:32,292
Men. As you were.

899
00:55:32,368 --> 00:55:35,860
In exactly 10 minutes we reach
our rendezvous point for the motor convoy.

900
00:55:35,939 --> 00:55:39,431
We'll proceed directly to our base,
bypassing Putnam's Landing.

901
00:55:39,509 --> 00:55:43,070
Now, you've all been fully briefed.
You know exactly nothing.

902
00:55:43,146 --> 00:55:45,137
That's the way it's gonna be.

903
00:55:45,214 --> 00:55:48,980
Not gonna be any guessing games about
this top secret project you've been assigned to.

904
00:55:49,052 --> 00:55:53,079
All your mail will be censored.
All taverns are off-limits to enlisted men.

905
00:55:53,156 --> 00:55:55,249
I'll tell you about further restrictions...

906
00:55:55,325 --> 00:55:58,055
uh, as they occur to me.

907
00:56:09,339 --> 00:56:11,330
Carry on.

908
00:56:18,081 --> 00:56:20,743
This is the first time
I've ever been top secret.

909
00:56:20,817 --> 00:56:23,217
What's more important
is what are we gonna do for boojum...

910
00:56:23,286 --> 00:56:25,481
in a jerkwater town
like Putnam's Landing?

911
00:56:25,555 --> 00:56:29,116
Brother, we're dead.
Stone-cold dead.

912
00:56:29,192 --> 00:56:33,390
I mean, small-town boojum's tough enough.
But boojum in a small New England town?

913
00:56:33,463 --> 00:56:36,432
Gentlemen, it's hopeless.
I don't know.

914
00:56:36,499 --> 00:56:39,798
Friends, let me tell you
about hick towns.

915
00:56:39,869 --> 00:56:44,329
I've been in New York, New Orleans,
St. Louis, Chicago and Hollywood...

916
00:56:44,407 --> 00:56:46,398
and I tell you the mortal truth.

917
00:56:46,476 --> 00:56:49,468
You'll find more boojum
per square inch in hick towns...

918
00:56:49,545 --> 00:56:52,241
than you will find in any big city
on this here green earth.

919
00:56:52,315 --> 00:56:54,715
Now, but just remember one thing-

920
00:56:54,784 --> 00:56:57,947
that when we get there,
when we start lookin' over that boo...

921
00:56:58,021 --> 00:57:00,080
they're gonna be lookin' us over too.

922
00:57:00,156 --> 00:57:03,717
And most important thing
of all is look sharp.

923
00:57:03,793 --> 00:57:06,193
That's half the secret.

924
00:57:06,262 --> 00:57:09,356
And I'll tell you the other half:
Act miserable.

925
00:57:09,432 --> 00:57:12,697
I don't get it.
Look sharp and act miserable?

926
00:57:12,769 --> 00:57:16,830
Son, there ain't nothin' attracts boo
more than a miserable man.

927
00:57:16,906 --> 00:57:19,636
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But how
do we convince them we're miserable?

928
00:57:19,709 --> 00:57:22,041
Now, that's the easiest thing
in the world.

929
00:57:22,111 --> 00:57:24,944
Tell the boo how lonesome
you are for the boo you left back home.

930
00:57:25,014 --> 00:57:27,812
- Tell the new boo about the old boo?
- Well, sure.

931
00:57:27,884 --> 00:57:31,445
Yeah. But what if you ain't got
an old boo back home?

932
00:57:33,289 --> 00:57:35,223
Well, then lie.

933
00:57:35,291 --> 00:57:39,022
Oh, but lie from here.
Lie from the heart.

934
00:57:39,095 --> 00:57:42,997
- Man, you are really an inspiration to us all.
- [Laughing]

935
00:57:49,038 --> 00:57:52,235
Looks like a crowd's gathered
at the bridge. I wonder why.

936
00:57:52,308 --> 00:57:54,469
They're probably feather merchants.

937
00:57:54,544 --> 00:57:56,808
I'm sure it's not
a welcoming committee.

938
00:57:56,879 --> 00:57:59,109
Close up! Close up!

939
00:58:19,068 --> 00:58:22,629
All right.
All right, let's clear this road.

940

Clear this road, everybody.
I said clear this road.

941

- Never.
- Nev-

00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:30,410
What's goin' on here?

943
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,348
We have asked you to move
your top secret elsewhere.

944
00:58:34,417 --> 00:58:36,385
You have refused.

945
00:58:36,452 --> 00:58:39,819
Now we refuse to accept your refusal.

946
00:58:39,889 --> 00:58:44,588
Lady, I got my orders,
and I am crossing that bridge.

947
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:47,458
So get these women and kids out of my way.
Now clear out, everybody!

948
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:49,521
- Never.
- What?

Never!

954
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:09,051
Captain Hoxie, why don't
we just take another road?

955
00:59:09,118 --> 00:59:11,143
There must be another way
to get to the base.

956
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:14,087
My orders read,
"Proceed north on Route 27 to the base."

957
00:59:14,157 --> 00:59:18,059
This is Route 27,
and this is the way we're gonna proceed.

to win. Come on. Close in the ranks.

take those kids home sooner or later.

for us to stand here.

964

I, uh, suggest
that we advance and reconnoiter.

- Yeah.

to tell you how delighted we are to be here.

01:05:20,789 --> 01:05:24,225
A naval off-
Well, that's all I need.

1052
01:05:24,293 --> 01:05:26,284
All right, send him in.
Send him in.

1053
01:05:28,631 --> 01:05:31,657
Now- Oh, no.

1054
01:05:33,469 --> 01:05:37,496
- What are you doing here?
- I, uh- I believe I outrank you, Hoxie.

1055
01:05:37,573 --> 01:05:40,201
But, uh, we'll dispense
with the customary formality.

1056
01:05:40,276 --> 01:05:44,235
I'm here partially because
of my affection for the naval reserve...

1057
01:05:44,313 --> 01:05:48,545
but mostly because you,
to put it mildly, lack tact.

1058
01:05:48,617 --> 01:05:50,551
Well, I had a little accident.

1059
01:05:50,619 --> 01:05:55,249
Oh, it was quite spectacular.
The general and I saw it on television.

1060
01:05:55,324 --> 01:05:57,554
- The general?
- Mm-hmm.

1061
01:05:57,626 --> 01:06:00,618
Here are my orders putting me in
full charge of public relations for this base...

1062
01:06:00,696 --> 01:06:03,221
reporting directly
to General Thorwald.

1063
01:06:03,299 --> 01:06:07,895
You mean after 17 years in the army he expects
me to work with a civilian navy officer?

1064
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:10,200
- Not with, Hoxie- For.
- Huh?

1065
01:06:10,272 --> 01:06:13,639
That is, in matters of public relations,
you will take orders from me.

1066
01:06:13,709 --> 01:06:15,643
You are forbidden to use your brain.

1067
01:06:15,711 --> 01:06:17,770
It's fully explained in there.
Fourteen copies.

1068
01:06:17,846 --> 01:06:21,475
- Well, he can't do this to me.
- Mm-hmm. That's what I said, and here I am.

1069
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:24,485
He- He-
[Sneezes]

1070
01:06:24,553 --> 01:06:28,045
- Is your head clear now?
- [Stammers] Uh-huh.

1071
01:06:28,123 --> 01:06:32,526
All right. Hoxie, the most important thing
that we have to do is to prove to this town...

1072
01:06:32,595 --> 01:06:37,965
that this top secret project
is-is absolutely harmless.

1073
01:06:38,033 --> 01:06:40,331
It, uh-
It is safe, isn't it?

1074
01:06:41,337 --> 01:06:43,567
Top secret.

1075
01:06:43,639 --> 01:06:46,472
And the most important person
that we have to convince is my wife.

1076
01:06:46,542 --> 01:06:50,000
You can stop right there.
I dislike your wife.

1077
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:52,206
Oh, well, then the feeling is mutual.

1078
01:06:52,281 --> 01:06:55,614
In fact, I might say I dislike your wife
almost as much as I dislike you.

1079
01:06:55,684 --> 01:06:58,175
- Also mutual.
- She made me look like a fool.

1080
01:06:58,254 --> 01:07:00,245
Well, don't blame my wife for your looks.

1081
01:07:00,322 --> 01:07:02,916
- Now, listen, Lieutenant!
- Commander.!

1082
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,728
How are you two men getting along?

1083
01:07:06,795 --> 01:07:09,889
Uh, army and navy.

1084
01:07:09,965 --> 01:07:11,899
- Hand in hand.
- [Chuckles]

1085
01:07:16,939 --> 01:07:20,932
He- He- He- He-
[Sneezes]

1086
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:24,078
[Doorbell Buzzes]

1087
01:07:24,146 --> 01:07:27,172
- Who is it?
- [Buzzing Continues]

1088
01:07:27,249 --> 01:07:30,480
- Who is it?
- [Buzzing Continues]

1089
01:07:35,658 --> 01:07:37,922
Hello.

1090
01:07:37,993 --> 01:07:42,259
I'm still not speaking to you,
but why are you in uniform?

1091
01:07:42,331 --> 01:07:46,324
Oh, well, I vaguely remember that somebody
nominated me to go to Washington...

1092
01:07:46,402 --> 01:07:48,996
and that's where
all my troubles started.

1093
01:07:49,071 --> 01:07:52,905
Now I find myself back in the service
helping the army create goodwill...

1094
01:07:52,975 --> 01:07:55,910
- in a little town that I wished
we'd never moved into!
- Shh!

1095
01:07:55,978 --> 01:07:59,573
It's Saturday.
I just put the children up for their naps.

1096
01:07:59,648 --> 01:08:01,809
Children, Daddy's home!

1097
01:08:07,156 --> 01:08:10,125
- Hi, Daddy!
- Hi, Daddy!

1098
01:08:15,064 --> 01:08:17,555
- Are you a soldier?
- Yeah.

1099
01:08:18,767 --> 01:08:20,826
Uh, let's go and play
in your room, huh? Huh?

1100
01:08:20,903 --> 01:08:23,770
- Fine.
- Forward! March!

1101
01:08:33,916 --> 01:08:36,248
- [Sighs]
- [Door Closes]

1102
01:08:38,287 --> 01:08:41,450
Because of the peaceful influence
of these God-fearing people...

1103
01:08:41,523 --> 01:08:45,983
the Pilgrims soon won over the Indians
and the pipe of peace was smoked.

1104
01:08:46,061 --> 01:08:47,995
- [Blows Raspberry]
- You wanna hear it again, boys?

1105
01:08:48,063 --> 01:08:51,362
- Yeah.
- Ah, ah, ah. The party's over.

1106
01:08:51,433 --> 01:08:55,563
Come on, boys. It's bedtime.
Get into your pajamas.

1107
01:08:55,637 --> 01:08:57,696
- Come on, boys. Mind your mother now.
- That's right.

1108
01:08:57,773 --> 01:09:01,265
- Down. Down. Down, Rover.
- Five minutes I wanna see you
in those pajamas, all right?

1109
01:09:01,343 --> 01:09:04,335
- And I wanna have a few words with you.
- Oh.

1110
01:09:04,413 --> 01:09:06,404
Don't forget to brush your teeth.

1111
01:09:08,484 --> 01:09:10,850
As for you, Harry Bannerman,
I am not at all surprised...

1112
01:09:10,919 --> 01:09:15,083
that at a time of crisis in Putnam's Landing,
you have joined the enemy.

1113
01:09:15,157 --> 01:09:18,320
Well, go.
Good-bye.

1114
01:09:19,695 --> 01:09:21,686
[Chuckles]

1115
01:09:36,145 --> 01:09:39,603
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night. [Kisses]

1116
01:09:45,788 --> 01:09:47,949
Good night, dear.

1117
01:09:48,023 --> 01:09:49,957
Good night, dear.

1118
01:09:54,696 --> 01:09:57,824
Well, you said everybody in pajamas.

1119
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:00,596
And I brushed my teeth too.
See?

1120
01:10:05,107 --> 01:10:07,940
- [Knocking]
- [Grace] Go away.!

1121
01:10:09,144 --> 01:10:13,137
I can't.
The boys made me promise I'd stay.

1122
01:10:13,215 --> 01:10:15,843
You coward, hiding behind children.

1123
01:10:15,918 --> 01:10:19,149
I hope you spend a miserable night
in the guest room.

1124
01:10:19,221 --> 01:10:21,689
I have been miserable in the guest room.
Grace, I, uh-

1125
01:10:21,757 --> 01:10:23,987
I've been thinking about a lot
of things, among other things...

1126
01:10:24,059 --> 01:10:26,323
but one thing I've been
thinking about most in particular.

1127
01:10:26,395 --> 01:10:29,193
And I think now, darling,
is the time to discuss that important thing.

1128
01:10:29,264 --> 01:10:31,425
- Get up and get out.
- L-

1129
01:10:34,303 --> 01:10:36,669
All right,
let's discuss the other things.

1130
01:10:36,738 --> 01:10:40,572
- Grace, you don't realize what a spot I'm in.
- Yes, I do. With me you're dead.

1131
01:10:40,642 --> 01:10:43,133
Yes, I know that.
But I'm talking about General Thorwald.

1132
01:10:43,212 --> 01:10:47,615
Look, I flew in with General Thorwald
this afternoon, and he made quite a point...

1133
01:10:47,683 --> 01:10:50,151
about telling me
how important myjob is.

1134
01:10:50,219 --> 01:10:53,484
- Better luck away from home.
- Thank you.

1135
01:10:53,555 --> 01:10:57,150
- Honey, look, if I goof on this job-
- Ah, ah.!

1136
01:10:57,226 --> 01:11:02,721
If I goof on this job, General Thorwald
says he has another job waiting for me...

1137
01:11:02,798 --> 01:11:04,823
in Alaska.

1138
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:07,300
Well, suppose I get
shipped up to Alaska?

1139
01:11:07,369 --> 01:11:09,803
Wear heavier underwear.

1140
01:11:09,872 --> 01:11:11,806
[Laughing]

1141
01:11:11,874 --> 01:11:13,967
Well, just laugh this off.

1142
01:11:14,042 --> 01:11:18,536
If I do get shipped to Alaska,
that means I have to give up my business.

1143
01:11:18,614 --> 01:11:21,913
And, uh, well, on my navy pay, l-

1144
01:11:21,984 --> 01:11:24,680
I can't possibly keep up
the payments on the house.

1145
01:11:24,753 --> 01:11:26,277
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1146
01:11:26,355 --> 01:11:28,721
And, uh, let's see.

1147
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:30,951
Oh, yes, they'll probably
repossess the car...

1148
01:11:31,026 --> 01:11:34,518
and, uh, Peter will have
to be removed from preschool.

1149
01:11:34,596 --> 01:11:37,895
Uh, there will be enough
for the bare essentials, I suppose.

1150
01:11:37,966 --> 01:11:40,491
I mean, plain, wholesome food.

1151
01:11:40,569 --> 01:11:44,369
While you're at it, why don't you suggest
we put the children up for adoption?

1152
01:11:44,439 --> 01:11:47,431
Okay. All right,
maybe I was laying it on a little thick...

1153
01:11:47,509 --> 01:11:49,443
but let me tell you something,
Mrs. Bannerman.

1154
01:11:49,511 --> 01:11:52,275
This is serious.
And you can help.

1155
01:11:52,347 --> 01:11:55,145
Maybe we can turn one of
your many vices into a virtue.

1156
01:11:55,217 --> 01:11:57,412
Just what do you mean by that?

1157
01:11:57,486 --> 01:12:02,446
Your pageant, honey.
Maybe the darn thing'll bail me out.

1158
01:12:02,524 --> 01:12:06,756
The way I see it, if you can use some of the
soldiers in it, along with the local talent...

1159
01:12:06,828 --> 01:12:10,525
it's sort of a gesture of goodwill.

1160
01:12:10,599 --> 01:12:13,500
Of course,
it's only a little acorn, but, uh-

1161
01:12:13,569 --> 01:12:16,094
Why don't you and your acorn grow up?

1162
01:12:16,171 --> 01:12:18,765
All you have to do is prove
to the people of Putnam's Landing...

1163
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,831
that whatever that is
out there is safe.

1164
01:12:20,909 --> 01:12:24,106
- Now can you do it?
- How can I, honey? I don't know what it is.

1165
01:12:24,179 --> 01:12:27,114
You're not only unfaithful. You're stupid.
[Scoffs]

1166
01:12:28,884 --> 01:12:31,944
- [Doorbell Buzzing]
- I wonder who that is.

1167
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:36,389
It's probably Angela Hoffa crocked
and wondering if you can come out to play.

1168
01:12:40,462 --> 01:12:43,522
- Who is it?
- [Man] Military courier from Washington, D. C...

1169
01:12:43,599 --> 01:12:45,760
with a special message
for Mrs. Grace Bannerman.

1170
01:12:45,834 --> 01:12:48,098
Uh, just a minute.

1171
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:50,104
Did you hear that?

1172
01:12:51,306 --> 01:12:53,240
Harry, can they do anything to me?

1173
01:12:53,308 --> 01:12:55,674
Well, I don't know, honey.
You have been fighting the army.

1174
01:12:55,744 --> 01:12:58,770
- If they tell me to go to Washington,
do I have to go?
- Of course.

1175
01:12:58,847 --> 01:13:02,044
That'd be funny if you had to appear
in front of a committee you didn't form.

1176
01:13:02,117 --> 01:13:04,051
Mmm.

1177
01:13:08,957 --> 01:13:12,222
- Mrs. Grace Bannerman?
- Yes?

1178
01:13:12,294 --> 01:13:15,889
- Of Putnam's Landing?
- Yes, yes.

1179
01:13:30,545 --> 01:13:33,412
It's for me, all right.

1180
01:13:33,482 --> 01:13:35,450
It's from the secretary of the army.

1181
01:13:35,517 --> 01:13:37,610
Oh, he's very important, honey.
He's close to the top.

1182
01:13:37,686 --> 01:13:43,147
But he's appealing to me. He calls me
"the leading force in the opposition."

1183
01:13:43,225 --> 01:13:47,184
He calls upon me to help give the installation
a chance to establish itself...

1184
01:13:47,262 --> 01:13:49,526
peaceably in the community.

1185
01:13:49,598 --> 01:13:55,093
"In so doing, Mrs. Bannerman, you not only
will be ending a major internal crisis...

1186
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:59,300
"but will establish yourself as one of
the truly great and unselfish patriots...

1187
01:13:59,374 --> 01:14:02,901
in our nation's proud history."

1188
01:14:02,978 --> 01:14:05,378
Isn't that a slight overstatement?

1189
01:14:07,716 --> 01:14:13,416
Well, Grace, now, uh, we don't know
how vital this thing out there is to the army.

1190
01:14:13,488 --> 01:14:15,888
But what can I do about it?
I'm on the other side.

1191
01:14:15,957 --> 01:14:18,949
We can solve a lot of our problems
if we'll just put our heads together.

1192
01:14:19,027 --> 01:14:21,257
- Just our heads.
- Like we used to. Up in the bedroom?

1193
01:14:21,329 --> 01:14:24,025
No, like we're going to
right down here.

1194
01:14:27,903 --> 01:14:30,064
You heard me.
Same thing goes for all of you.

1195
01:14:30,138 --> 01:14:32,129
Let's finish our drinks
and get out of here, huh?

1196
01:14:32,207 --> 01:14:36,075
Aw, please, Captain.
What are you trying to do, empty my joint?

1197
01:14:37,412 --> 01:14:39,277
You shouldn't have called
them all feather merchants.

1198
01:14:39,347 --> 01:14:42,748
Huh?
That goes for you too.

1199
01:14:42,818 --> 01:14:46,811
Hey, where were you during
the last "unpleasantness"?

1200
01:14:46,888 --> 01:14:49,789
I keep telling you,
I was all over Korea.

1201
01:14:49,858 --> 01:14:52,691
Well, don't change the subject.
Look at you now.

1202
01:14:52,761 --> 01:14:56,060
Yeah? Well, how come you
got no higher than a captain?

1203
01:14:56,131 --> 01:14:58,099
L-

1204
01:14:58,166 --> 01:15:00,430
Well, I've been reclassified three times.

1205
01:15:00,502 --> 01:15:03,494
- Yeah? Well, once more oughta do it.
- Mm-hmm.

1206
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:14,540
You stay out of my icebox.

1207
01:15:14,616 --> 01:15:18,279
I wanted a-
Never mind. I'll just drink.

1208
01:15:19,421 --> 01:15:21,355
No whiskey, huh?

1209
01:15:21,423 --> 01:15:24,620
As long as you're not around,
we don't need any alcohol.

1210
01:15:24,693 --> 01:15:28,686
Of course, if I'd known you were coming,
I could've gotten champagne and caviar.

1211
01:15:28,764 --> 01:15:33,292
[Ringing]

1212
01:15:33,368 --> 01:15:36,064
Hello?

1213
01:15:36,138 --> 01:15:38,129
Hello.

1214
01:15:38,206 --> 01:15:40,538
Hello?

1215
01:15:42,577 --> 01:15:44,511
It was Angela.

1216
01:15:44,579 --> 01:15:46,945
- How could it be Angela if nobody answered?
- I see it all now.

1217
01:15:47,015 --> 01:15:49,575
You probably told her
if a woman answers, hang up.

1218
01:15:49,651 --> 01:15:53,610
I wouldn't have your mind for anything.
Now just stop thinking about Angela-

1219
01:15:53,688 --> 01:15:55,918
How can I?
The very idea.

1220
01:15:55,991 --> 01:15:59,324
A married man,
father of two lovely boys, not satisfied.

1221
01:15:59,394 --> 01:16:01,624
- Not satis- Grace, I didn't do it.
- And premeditated too.

1222
01:16:01,696 --> 01:16:03,960
How long have you two
been planning this orgy?

1223
01:16:04,032 --> 01:16:06,193
Orgy?
Grace, I'm absolutely innocent!

1224
01:16:06,268 --> 01:16:09,294
- The minute I saw Angela, you know what I did?
- You took your clothes off!

1225
01:16:09,371 --> 01:16:13,239
It all comes back to me!
[Sobbing]

1226
01:16:20,048 --> 01:16:22,516
I forgot.
We're finished.

1227
01:16:27,622 --> 01:16:32,559
Now, and just what did you have in mind
about my damn pageant?

1228
01:16:35,163 --> 01:16:37,131
- I can't concentrate.
- Well, come on. I'm listening.

1229
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:39,224
No, it was only a half-baked idea.

1230
01:16:39,301 --> 01:16:41,235
Well, that's all right.
Tell me anyway.

1231
01:16:41,303 --> 01:16:44,204
Well, when I was reading
to the kids it occurred to me...

1232
01:16:44,272 --> 01:16:49,676
that maybe the- the army could play
sort of, uh, brave, pioneering Pilgrims...

1233
01:16:49,744 --> 01:16:52,838
that landed in a swarm of savage,
hostile Indian-

1234
01:16:52,914 --> 01:16:54,905
- Forget it.
- It is a half-baked idea.

1235
01:16:54,983 --> 01:16:57,975
- Nothing would appeal to you
in your frame of mind.
- Is that all there is?

1236
01:16:58,053 --> 01:17:00,248
- No, I had some other-
- You're gonna leave it hanging there?

1237
01:17:00,322 --> 01:17:05,453
It could all end with a-with all of
these people smoking a peace pipe.

1238
01:17:05,527 --> 01:17:08,155
Well, it's better than last summer's
George Washington...

1239
01:17:08,230 --> 01:17:10,164
freezing to death at Valley Forge.

1240
01:17:10,232 --> 01:17:11,893
Perspiring? Huh.

1241
01:17:11,967 --> 01:17:15,733
- Good night.
- Well, you've done it.

1242
01:17:15,804 --> 01:17:19,501
Ah.
[Laughs]

1243
01:17:19,574 --> 01:17:24,637
Uh, I beg your pardon, but is there
any reason why you shouldn't talk to me?

1244
01:17:24,713 --> 01:17:27,238
- [Door Closes]
- [Engine Starts]

1245
01:17:27,315 --> 01:17:30,148
No.

1246
01:17:30,218 --> 01:17:34,177
As a matter of fact,
you could do me a very large favor.

1247
01:17:34,256 --> 01:17:38,317
Well, things are picking up here
in Putnam's Landing.

1248
01:17:38,393 --> 01:17:40,759
Will you call this number?

1249
01:17:40,829 --> 01:17:43,696
Mm-hmm.
Oh, now, please.

1250
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:48,936
And whom shall I ask for?

1251
01:17:49,004 --> 01:17:51,438
- Harry Bannerman.
- Mm-hmm.

1252
01:17:51,506 --> 01:17:54,600
Uh- Oh, no.

1253
01:17:54,676 --> 01:17:56,667
[Laughing]

1254
01:18:01,082 --> 01:18:03,880
I think I'll just have
another drink here. L-

1255
01:18:03,952 --> 01:18:07,115
Harry-
Innkeeper!

1256
01:18:09,724 --> 01:18:12,818
May I, uh, use a little
of your hot water?

1257
01:18:12,894 --> 01:18:16,728
- You kill me.
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.

1258
01:18:16,798 --> 01:18:19,562
Well, without any help from you,
I think we're doing very nicely.

1259
01:18:19,634 --> 01:18:24,367
We, uh- It's taking very definite shape,
and, uh, in fact, it could be brilliant.

1260
01:18:24,439 --> 01:18:29,900
All we need is just one ingredient
to sort of hold this spectacle together.

1261
01:18:31,379 --> 01:18:33,347
Yes, I think I've got it.

1262
01:18:33,415 --> 01:18:37,374
Um, towering above
this-this majestic spectacle...

1263
01:18:37,452 --> 01:18:42,856
will be one dramatic voice:
The narrator.

1264
01:18:42,924 --> 01:18:45,586
Of course, I really don't know
who's available for the part.

1265
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:49,221
We'd have to get a vibrant personality
with a fine voice, beautiful.

1266
01:18:49,297 --> 01:18:52,198
Uh, a captivating figure, simply clad.

1267
01:18:52,267 --> 01:18:56,101
Angela Hoffa in a bedspread.

1268
01:18:57,372 --> 01:18:59,363
Yeah.

1269
01:19:01,876 --> 01:19:05,505
Actually, Captain Hoxie,
I think you've misjudged Harry Bannerman.

1270
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:09,243
- [Laughs]
- He has a very understanding and kind...

1271
01:19:09,317 --> 01:19:12,809
- and sympathetic heart.
- [Laughs] Yeah.

1272
01:19:12,887 --> 01:19:15,822
Look, if you'd just call him
and tell him the truth.

1273
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:19,485
Tell him that you accidently drove
your jeep into the statue of Samuel Putnam...

1274
01:19:19,561 --> 01:19:21,495
that you're here in the bar, loaded...

1275
01:19:21,563 --> 01:19:24,396
that you want him to come over
and drive you back to the base.

1276
01:19:24,466 --> 01:19:28,835
- I wouldn't ask a civilian in uniform for anything.
- [Sighs]

1277
01:19:28,903 --> 01:19:31,872
Well, then will you just call this number
and ask for Harry Bannerman?

1278
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:33,874
- And I'll take it from there.
- Mmm.

1279
01:19:33,942 --> 01:19:36,672
For me?

1280
01:19:36,745 --> 01:19:39,145
All right. F-For you.

1281
01:19:56,031 --> 01:19:58,056
You got a dime?

1282
01:20:00,869 --> 01:20:02,803
Thank you very much.

1283
01:20:02,871 --> 01:20:06,102
What a beautiful day it'll be.
First your magnificent pageant...

1284
01:20:06,174 --> 01:20:09,439
and-and- and, uh, with you
having the only speaking role.

1285
01:20:09,511 --> 01:20:12,639
And then the fun and
the fraternization later.

1286
01:20:12,714 --> 01:20:15,979
Very beautiful, except who's going
to persuade the citizens...

1287
01:20:16,051 --> 01:20:18,110
to participate with the soldiers?

1288
01:20:18,186 --> 01:20:20,120
That's your job, honey.
After all, you're their leader.

1289
01:20:20,188 --> 01:20:23,214
I am not their leader
if I'm speaking for the army.

1290
01:20:23,291 --> 01:20:26,089
Well, what about the secretary of the army?
Are you gonna let him down?

1291
01:20:26,161 --> 01:20:28,789
[Phone Rings]

1292
01:20:28,863 --> 01:20:31,730
Why don't you answer it this time?
Maybe she'll talk to you.

1293
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,064
Oh. Hello.

1294
01:20:34,135 --> 01:20:37,002
Uh, Bannerman?
This is Hoxie.

1295
01:20:37,072 --> 01:20:40,166
Now this wasn't my idea,
because I wouldn't talk to you-

1296
01:20:40,241 --> 01:20:43,768
- Uh, yes, Captain Hoxie.
- Oh, come off it.

1297
01:20:43,845 --> 01:20:46,678
Excuse me.
Well, it is Captain Hoxie.

1298
01:20:46,748 --> 01:20:49,342
- Would you like to speak to him?
- Yeah.

1299
01:20:49,417 --> 01:20:53,080
- Listen to me-
- Captain Hoxie. Get yourself a drink, Captain.

1300
01:20:53,154 --> 01:20:55,247
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1301
01:20:55,323 --> 01:20:59,191
Uh, just a minute.
What was that, Captain Hoxie?

1302
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:01,660
Uh, no, darling.
This is Angela.

1303
01:21:01,729 --> 01:21:04,960
Look, I'm here at Ye Olde Putnam House
with your little friend Captain Hoxie.

1304
01:21:05,033 --> 01:21:08,469
And he-he's really- He's full of flit,
and he's stoned out of his skull.

1305
01:21:08,536 --> 01:21:10,766
Uh, yes, Hoxie.

1306
01:21:10,839 --> 01:21:13,137
He's ready to turn everything
else upside down around here...

1307
01:21:13,208 --> 01:21:16,143
so you'd better come right over
and get him right away.

1308
01:21:16,211 --> 01:21:19,237
- Well, look, dear, I can't get over there-
- What?

1309
01:21:19,314 --> 01:21:22,340
Uh, just a minute.

1310
01:21:22,417 --> 01:21:25,045
You got me so confused.
See, I thought I was talking to you.

1311
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,816
- Let me talk to him.
- Honey, you don't want to talk to him.

1312
01:21:27,889 --> 01:21:30,084
Wait a minute.
You don't want to talk to him. He's drunk.

1313
01:21:30,158 --> 01:21:32,388
He's at Ye Olde Putnam House.
He's wrecked his jeep.

1314
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:35,258
He's about to wreck my whole public relations
job. You don't want to talk to him.

1315
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:37,264
- Yes, I do.
- Oh, you do?

1316
01:21:37,332 --> 01:21:39,300
Yes.

1317
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:46,634
Well, uh- Uh, listen here, Hoxie.
Mrs. Bannerman wants to talk to you.

1318
01:21:46,708 --> 01:21:49,176
Oh. Oh. Yes.
Captain Hoxie!

1319
01:21:49,244 --> 01:21:51,178
And-And watch your language,
will you?

1320
01:21:51,246 --> 01:21:53,578
And-And pull yourself together,
Captain Hoxie.

1321
01:21:53,648 --> 01:21:56,344
Yes, I will.
Mrs. Bannerman. Mrs. - 

1322
01:21:56,417 --> 01:22:00,319
- [Stammering]
- Mrs. -  Mrs. Bannerman wants to talk.

1323
01:22:03,358 --> 01:22:07,089
- Uh, hello, Mrs. Bannerman.
- Oh, it is you, Captain Hoxie.

1324
01:22:07,162 --> 01:22:09,096
Well, who did you think it was?

1325
01:22:09,164 --> 01:22:12,793
I welcome this opportunity
to say a few words to you, you-

1326
01:22:12,867 --> 01:22:15,495
Captain Hoxie, I think
you're a disgrace to the army.

1327
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:18,300
Drunk and wrecking public property?
You ought to be ashamed.

1328
01:22:18,373 --> 01:22:21,342
I want to talk to Mr. Bannerman.

1329
01:22:21,409 --> 01:22:22,899
- Mrs.?
- Mister.

1330
01:22:22,977 --> 01:22:24,467
- Mister?
- Mister.

1331
01:22:24,546 --> 01:22:27,071
Oh! Oh.

1332
01:22:27,148 --> 01:22:30,015
On second thought, l-
I'd rather speak to your husband.

1333
01:22:30,084 --> 01:22:33,781
He says he wants to talk to you
so he can swear probably.

1334
01:22:33,855 --> 01:22:36,323
- Well, I'll take care of him.
- Just a minute.

1335
01:22:36,391 --> 01:22:38,825
Here-Here's Mr. Bannerman.

1336
01:22:38,893 --> 01:22:40,827
[Gagging]

1337
01:22:40,895 --> 01:22:44,194
L-l-I beg-
l-l- I beg, uh-

1338
01:22:44,265 --> 01:22:46,495
- I beg your-your pardon.
- You need a drink, Captain Hoxie.

1339
01:22:46,568 --> 01:22:49,969
- To the bar. Bar.
- I think you're exactly right.

1340
01:22:50,038 --> 01:22:52,472
Now, listen here, Hoxie-

1341
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:54,565
No, no, no, darling.
You listen to me.

1342
01:22:54,642 --> 01:22:57,270
You can't avoid me.
I'm inevitable.

1343
01:22:57,345 --> 01:23:01,076
Now, I understand that you are being
tossed out of your happy little home.

1344
01:23:01,149 --> 01:23:03,982
And Oscar called from Hollywood,
and he's very suspicious.

1345
01:23:04,052 --> 01:23:06,748
So why don't you help me
make his suspicions come true?

1346
01:23:06,821 --> 01:23:11,019
Well, uh- Such language.
It's just shocking.

1347
01:23:11,092 --> 01:23:13,424
Listen, Hoxie,
I will not drive you home.

1348
01:23:13,494 --> 01:23:17,328
Can you imagine? You and me
in Reno together for six weeks...

1349
01:23:17,398 --> 01:23:19,992
with nothing to do but roll dice?

1350
01:23:20,068 --> 01:23:22,536
No. No. My wife considers
your call an intrusion...

1351
01:23:22,604 --> 01:23:24,731
and she insists that
I do not go out tonight.

1352
01:23:24,806 --> 01:23:27,639
- Now you're hiding behind me.
You're welcome to go.
- Shh. No.

1353
01:23:27,709 --> 01:23:30,769
And stay.
And hurry.

1354
01:23:30,845 --> 01:23:33,109
- He'll be right over.
- Wonderful-

1355
01:23:33,181 --> 01:23:35,411
What? Who is this?

1356
01:23:37,085 --> 01:23:40,020
[In Nasal Voice]
One, two, three, four.

1357
01:23:40,088 --> 01:23:42,113
This is the operator.

1358
01:23:42,190 --> 01:23:44,681
Is your line in order?

1359
01:23:44,759 --> 01:23:47,250
Angela Hoffa is
a worse actress than I am.

1360
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:50,422
Now she's playing
an operator with adenoids.

1361
01:23:51,699 --> 01:23:55,795
The number you have been
dialing is a wrong number.

1362
01:23:55,870 --> 01:24:00,500
Operator, tell your party
I'll be right down.

1363
01:24:04,579 --> 01:24:06,570
It did sound like Angela, didn't it?

1364
01:24:11,252 --> 01:24:13,186
Well, all right, it was Angela...

1365
01:24:13,254 --> 01:24:16,712
but-but it was also Hoxie,
and he's drunk and he's on a rampage and-

1366
01:24:17,992 --> 01:24:20,483
Well, I couldn't get in
any deeper than I am now...

Angela, please give me a hand.
Help me get him to the car.

1375
01:24:44,752 --> 01:24:47,118
I've gotta get him back to the base.
Come on, Hoxie.

1376
01:24:47,188 --> 01:24:49,520
- Only if I can go along.

- Come on, Hoxie.

Wait a minute.
Who's gonna pay his tab?

Oh, General.
Oh, boy.

- Do I look relaxed?

1388
01:25:28,196 --> 01:25:32,292
I've asked everybody on the base but you.
Have you seen Hoxie?

01:25:32,367 --> 01:25:36,201
Hoxie?
Oscar Hoffa?

1390

Hello, Bannerman.
Have you been fooling around with my wife?

Whoa. Uh- Now,
why would you say something like that?

1392
01:25:43,911 --> 01:25:47,870
Just got in from Hollywood.
A bad report on my wife.

- Some chiseler right here in Putnam's Landing.
- Is that so?

[Vehicle Departs]

1403
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:29,083
First and foremost, I want to thank
Mr. Isaac Goodpasture...

1404
01:26:29,157 --> 01:26:32,456
for that splendid article
describing my pageant.

1405
01:26:32,527 --> 01:26:35,087
And, of course, I'm intensely grateful
to General Thorwald.

1406
01:26:35,163 --> 01:26:39,065
Through his efforts, our pageant
will be even greater than ever this year.

1407
01:26:39,133 --> 01:26:42,296
Now, of course, you understand,
this does not mean...

1408
01:26:42,370 --> 01:26:47,171
that I am dropping my opposition
to the establishment
of a top secret base in our community.

1409
01:26:47,241 --> 01:26:49,675
Oh, no.
It simply means...

1410
01:26:49,744 --> 01:26:54,977
that I am willing to give the army
a chance to prove that I am wrong.

1411
01:26:55,049 --> 01:26:57,950
I regret to report that
we have already received...

1412
01:26:58,019 --> 01:27:00,681
a great deal of
unfavorable publicity.

1413
01:27:00,755 --> 01:27:05,954
News of our resistance has caused
grave concern in Washington, D.C.

1414
01:27:07,628 --> 01:27:10,324
As a matter of fact,
I have right here...

1415
01:27:10,398 --> 01:27:14,129
a letter that I received
from the secretary of the army.

01:27:14,202 --> 01:27:16,432
- How did he get into this?
- L- I'll find out.

1417
01:27:16,504 --> 01:27:18,495
I repeat, none other
than the secretary of the army...

asking us to demonstrate
our patriotism...

- However, we've seen a great deal of Angela.

1431
01:28:08,022 --> 01:28:10,650
Yes.
Angela's given me a sense of guilt.

1432
01:28:10,725 --> 01:28:14,092
I've been absent so much I've missed out
on being a part of the local activities.

on a great deal.

[Narrator] Well, this is it.
The day of days at Putnam's Landing...

1487
01:31:47,842 --> 01:31:51,243
where Pilgrims meet Indians,
and civilians meet army.

1488
01:31:51,312 --> 01:31:53,906
And doves of peace
whisper gently...

1489
01:31:53,981 --> 01:31:56,609
that all must learn to live
happily side by side.

1490
01:31:56,684 --> 01:32:01,018
Friends and neighbors,
there's a well-known saying...

1491
01:32:01,222 --> 01:32:04,248
that coming events
cast their shadows.

1492
01:32:04,325 --> 01:32:07,317
Now today I hope-

Well, so much for that.

"I will now take you back
many, many years...

Captain Hoxie,
you will proceed to shore.

All right, snap to it, you guys.

Uh, Mayflower to General Thorwald.

1545
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:49,732
Sir, my ship seems to be
changing position rapidly.

1546
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:51,869
Is it changing to port
or to starboard?

1547
01:36:53,414 --> 01:36:55,348
I would say
it's downward, sir.

1548
01:37:14,068 --> 01:37:16,559
[Cheering]

1549
01:37:22,409 --> 01:37:26,106
Thorwald? This is the Mayflower, sir.
L-I've got a bit of a problem.

1550
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:29,172
- Don't give up the ship.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1551
01:37:37,691 --> 01:37:39,784
Calling General Thorwald, sir.

1552
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:43,296
Over... and under.

1553
01:38:17,164 --> 01:38:19,894
[Narrator]
In a last desperate effort to save the day...

1554
01:38:19,967 --> 01:38:23,698
General Thorwald decided to let
the governing body of Putnam's Landing...

1555
01:38:23,770 --> 01:38:26,261
in on the big secret.

1556
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:30,208
Now we find Captain Hoxie
in charge of a chimpanzee.

1557
01:38:30,277 --> 01:38:32,837
He, the chimp-
the one on the left-

1558
01:38:32,913 --> 01:38:35,473
plays an important role in
the army's closely-guarded secret.

1559
01:38:35,549 --> 01:38:37,915
- Ah.
- [Chimp Shouting]

1560
01:38:37,985 --> 01:38:41,887
Here's the secret
we are going to share.

1561
01:38:41,955 --> 01:38:45,220
Come on, LeRoy.
[Chuckles]

1562
01:38:45,292 --> 01:38:49,092
There we are. Oh!

1563
01:38:49,163 --> 01:38:54,863
Ah. This little fellow is going
to take a journey into space...

1564
01:38:54,935 --> 01:38:58,029
and return, alive.

1565
01:38:58,105 --> 01:39:00,665
- Aren't you? Yes, he agrees.
- [Chattering]

1566
01:39:00,741 --> 01:39:04,108
Every conceivable precaution
has been taken for his safe return.

1567
01:39:04,178 --> 01:39:07,238
It's 99 and 9/10ths percent assured.

1568
01:39:07,314 --> 01:39:12,479
But that is why we are sending this
little fella instead of a human volunteer.

1569
01:39:12,553 --> 01:39:17,081
Now then, we will enact for you just what
will take place in the foreseeable future.

1570
01:39:17,157 --> 01:39:21,093
Uh, up to the point
of takeoff, of course.

1571
01:39:21,161 --> 01:39:24,358
Captain, would you take LeRoy
and put him up in the cone, please?

1572
01:39:24,431 --> 01:39:26,456
- Yes, sir.
- There.

1573
01:39:26,533 --> 01:39:29,161
LeRoy won't let anybody
but Captain Hoxie put him up there.

1574
01:39:29,236 --> 01:39:31,227
Well, lately he's begun
to fight me too.

1575
01:39:31,305 --> 01:39:34,035
- [Squealing]
- Huh?

1576
01:39:34,107 --> 01:39:35,870
Y-You see what I mean, sir?

1577
01:39:35,943 --> 01:39:40,277
Uh, this- this may take a little time.

1578
01:39:40,347 --> 01:39:44,215
So while we're waiting for LeRoy
to get housed in the cone...

1579
01:39:44,284 --> 01:39:46,809
- I'd like to show you the extreme precaution...
- [Squealing Continues]

1580
01:39:46,887 --> 01:39:49,355
We will take at
the actual launching.

1581
01:39:49,423 --> 01:39:51,357
Follow me, gentlemen.

1582
01:39:52,726 --> 01:39:56,127
Now, gentlemen,
if all these gadgets confuse you...

1583
01:39:56,196 --> 01:39:58,630
believe me, you are not alone.

1584
01:39:58,699 --> 01:40:03,102
Only the big brains- uh, the scientists-
know the inner workings.

1585
01:40:03,170 --> 01:40:05,934
In layman's language
it boils down to...

1586
01:40:06,006 --> 01:40:09,203
lever number one,
lever number two...

1587
01:40:09,276 --> 01:40:11,267
and the button.

1588
01:40:11,345 --> 01:40:15,406
Now, if you'll retain that simple thought,
I'll take you into control room number two.

1589
01:40:15,482 --> 01:40:18,451
Uh, this way, gentlemen.
Through there, please.

1590
01:40:18,518 --> 01:40:22,113
[LeRoy Screaming]

1591
01:40:25,826 --> 01:40:28,795
You will follow me, please.

1592
01:40:32,332 --> 01:40:34,425
[Screaming Continues]

1593
01:40:34,501 --> 01:40:36,435
[Chuckles]

1594
01:40:36,503 --> 01:40:40,064
They've been together so much
I think they're getting on each other's nerves.

1595
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:42,074
[Laughing]

1596
01:40:42,142 --> 01:40:44,474
- No. You-
- [Screaming Continues]

1597
01:40:44,544 --> 01:40:46,478
Ah!

1598
01:40:46,546 --> 01:40:49,777
Now you remember the controls
in the other room-

1599
01:40:49,850 --> 01:40:53,752
Lever number one,
lever number two and the button.

1600
01:40:53,820 --> 01:40:57,347
Now, gentlemen, this is indeed
a mechanized age we're living in.

1601
01:40:57,424 --> 01:41:00,484
Uh, for instance-
Excuse me.

1602
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:02,221
N-

1603
01:41:04,164 --> 01:41:08,362
[Narrator] At the base hospital, they removed
Grace's wet clothes and dismissed her.

1604
01:41:08,435 --> 01:41:11,495
As an afterthought,
they gave her this outfit.

1605
01:41:14,074 --> 01:41:16,838
Here. You see?
Each step of this complicated procedure...

1606
01:41:16,910 --> 01:41:20,311
can be followed on these
panels around the room.

1607
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:25,477
And, uh, later you'll be able to see
the activity at the actual launching site.

1608
01:41:25,552 --> 01:41:28,612
But, gentlemen,
in the final analysis...

1609
01:41:28,689 --> 01:41:32,022
it is the human equation
that really counts.

1610
01:41:34,461 --> 01:41:37,624
Hello, operator. I was told
that I would find General Thorwald...

1611
01:41:37,698 --> 01:41:39,962
in control room number one, but he-

1612
01:41:41,401 --> 01:41:44,029
Never mind.

1613
01:41:44,104 --> 01:41:46,038
I just missed you
at the base hospital.

1614
01:41:46,106 --> 01:41:49,303
They told me that they had ordered
you home and straight to bed.

1615
01:41:49,376 --> 01:41:53,938
I have to apologize to General Thorwald first.
Thank you.

1616
01:41:54,014 --> 01:41:56,175
Well, forget about General Thorwald.

1617
01:41:56,249 --> 01:41:58,717
- You know, maybe you'd better
apologize to me first.
- Harry!

1618
01:41:58,785 --> 01:42:00,719
This is a showdown!

1619
01:42:00,787 --> 01:42:04,951
The first thing I have to say is I love you,
and I'm tired of sleeping in the guest room.

1620
01:42:05,025 --> 01:42:07,960
- Harry!
- And the second thing that I have to say...

1621
01:42:08,028 --> 01:42:10,394
is that- that I am a man
who wants his wife back.

1622
01:42:10,464 --> 01:42:13,661
- And I'm gonna get her back, too,
because I am right on my side...
- [Squeals]

1623
01:42:13,734 --> 01:42:16,134
And-and no pigheaded woman's
gonna wreck my home.

1624
01:42:16,203 --> 01:42:21,106
The rocket cannot be launched until
all are agreed that conditions are perfect.

1625
01:42:21,174 --> 01:42:27,135
At that moment, lever number one here and
lever number one in the other room are pulled.

1626
01:42:28,148 --> 01:42:30,082
Harry, you're going berserk!

1627
01:42:30,150 --> 01:42:32,914
- Not only that, but I am running amok!
- [Screams]

1628
01:42:32,986 --> 01:42:35,853
Now watch.

1629
01:42:35,922 --> 01:42:40,882
Uh, this is our closed-circuit
color television.

1630
01:42:40,961 --> 01:42:45,261
And I will try to describe some of
the intricacies of this massive operation.

1631
01:42:45,332 --> 01:42:48,199
Now this on the side is the crane.

1632
01:42:48,268 --> 01:42:51,499
Uh, we call it the "gantry."

1633
01:42:51,571 --> 01:42:54,096
Here you see a long shot
of the crane. There it is.

1634
01:42:54,174 --> 01:42:56,699
There's the rocket
which is 90 feet high.

1635
01:42:56,777 --> 01:43:00,235
Now in a moment
the crane will be removed.

1636
01:43:00,313 --> 01:43:03,578
Every man becomes tense
as we near the end of the countdown.

1637
01:43:03,650 --> 01:43:06,016
Although this is only a dry run...

1638
01:43:06,086 --> 01:43:08,611
one still gets a great feeling
of excitement.

1639
01:43:08,688 --> 01:43:13,125
Then if the men controlling lever number two
are in accord, the same thing applies.

1640
01:43:13,193 --> 01:43:15,127
Follow?

1641
01:43:15,195 --> 01:43:18,892
Now, while I'm still the aggressor,
we're gonna get one thing straight.

1642
01:43:18,965 --> 01:43:21,900
There was absolutely nothing going on
between me and Angela Hoffa.

1643
01:43:21,968 --> 01:43:24,528
- But I mean absolutely nothing going on-
- Stop. Stop.

1644
01:43:24,604 --> 01:43:26,538
I believe you.

1645
01:43:26,606 --> 01:43:30,906
Would you like to, uh,
clarify that statement?

1646
01:43:30,977 --> 01:43:34,105
- I have faith in you.
- Honey, do you-

1647
01:43:34,181 --> 01:43:37,708
[Clears Throat] Do you have a fever?
I mean, you're not yourself.

1648
01:43:37,784 --> 01:43:39,877
- Like this afternoon, jumping into the bay...
- [Sighs]

1649
01:43:39,953 --> 01:43:42,615
And trying to end it all
because your pageant was a flop.

1650
01:43:42,689 --> 01:43:44,953
Oh, honey, you're lovably stupid.

1651
01:43:45,025 --> 01:43:49,655
Aren't you ashamed? I mean, did you forget
that you're the mother of two children?

1652
01:43:49,729 --> 01:43:53,062
No. I was thinking of their father.

1653
01:43:53,133 --> 01:43:56,000
When I saw you hit the water,
and I didn't see you come up-

1654
01:43:56,069 --> 01:43:58,003
You mean, you tried to re-

1655
01:43:58,071 --> 01:44:01,268
- Honey, the deepest water you've
ever been in is the bathtub.
- Uh-huh.

1656
01:44:01,341 --> 01:44:03,275
- I mean, without water wings.
- [Laughs]

1657
01:44:03,343 --> 01:44:05,573
And, now, when all are agreed
the conditions are perfect...

1658
01:44:05,645 --> 01:44:08,637
and during the countdown procedure
at "X" minus five...

1659
01:44:08,715 --> 01:44:11,684
two men must make
the same momentous decision...

1660
01:44:11,751 --> 01:44:15,812
to press the identical buttons
setting off the electronic triggering device.

1661
01:44:15,889 --> 01:44:19,154
Oh, Grace Oglethorpe, home we go.

1662
01:44:19,226 --> 01:44:21,694
And then I'm gonna put you in
a hot tub of water.

1663
01:44:21,761 --> 01:44:25,128
- Yeah. What else?
- And then I'm gonna give you
a big snifter of hot brandy.

1664
01:44:25,198 --> 01:44:27,598
- Yeah. What else?
- And so to bed.

1665
01:44:27,667 --> 01:44:29,601
[Moans]

1666
01:44:29,669 --> 01:44:31,830
And then we'll attempt
to solve my problem.

1667
01:44:31,905 --> 01:44:33,998
What do you say to that?

1668
01:44:34,074 --> 01:44:37,271
Now when the triggering device is set off,
the red light goes on overhead...

1669
01:44:37,344 --> 01:44:39,676
and LeRoy is on his way.

1670
01:44:39,746 --> 01:44:42,044
- Of course, nothing happens now.
- [Machinery Starting Up]

1671
01:44:42,115 --> 01:44:44,049
The red light is on.

1672
01:45:01,601 --> 01:45:03,592
What happened?

1673
01:45:11,945 --> 01:45:14,345
[LeRoy Chattering]

1674
01:45:16,783 --> 01:45:19,047
LeRoy! Where's Hoxie?

1675
01:45:19,119 --> 01:45:21,053
[Chattering]

1676
01:45:29,062 --> 01:45:31,326
Is that Hoxie up there?

1677
01:45:31,398 --> 01:45:33,696
[Laughing]
Who-Who else?

1678
01:45:35,969 --> 01:45:37,903
Can he get out?

1679
01:45:37,971 --> 01:45:41,498
If he has sense enough to eject himself,
he'll float down.

1680
01:45:43,410 --> 01:45:45,435
And be court-martialed.

1681
01:45:45,512 --> 01:45:47,503
[Laughing]

1682
01:45:52,385 --> 01:45:56,219
[Phone Rings]

1683
01:45:59,459 --> 01:46:02,860
- Hello.
- Good luck, Harry.

1684
01:46:02,929 --> 01:46:04,920
Thank you.

1685
01:46:08,168 --> 01:46:10,568
Well, who was that?

1686
01:46:10,637 --> 01:46:12,628
Angela Hoffa.

1687
01:46:12,706 --> 01:46:15,072
Oh, Harry.

1688
01:46:15,141 --> 01:46:17,632
[Laughing]

1689
01:46:18,632 --> 01:46:28,632
