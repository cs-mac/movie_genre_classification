Hello? Make me Viral, PR Headquarters.

You want to talk to Sol Bi?

17

(Sol Bi?)

00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:08,160
Unfortunately, she's not with us anymore.

00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,860
I'll work harder.

- Okay. - What does he want with her?

21
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,500
Hello?

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,560

23
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,900
She's not here. Sorry.

24
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,900
Would I get fired soon too?

25
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,270
I wouldn't say you'd get fired.

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,470
I'd rather say...

27
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,970
you'd be gone.

28
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,340
- With the wind? - I guess so.

Eun Hyuk, is your seat comfortable?

30
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,550
It feels like sitting on pins and needles.

- It's quite rare... - To see them together.

56
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,890
It's something you can only see in Make me Viral.

57
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:45,890
I guess...

58
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,020
Taeyang didn't even know who'd be here with him.

59
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,990
No one told him about it.

60
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,860
Again, they are...

61
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,630

63
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,700
I'm so excited that they're here.

64
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,240
It's rare to see them together.

65
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,500
In fact, I decided to come here...

66
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,240
because of Heung Kook.

67
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,240
Every time I see Heung Kook on TV,

68
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,710
- I find him hilarious. - Of course.

69
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,580
He is the Variety Cheat Code.

70
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,180
Since he'll be on the show too,

71
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,520
I thought that I'd learn some pointers from him.

72
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,650
I see.

73
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,420
The lyrics to "Tiger Swallowtail" include "hide above clouds".

74
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,890
- Yes. - That's right.

75
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,290
I've been above the clouds for all this time,

76
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,530
but now I've met the sun.

77
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,860
(He met the sun.)

78
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,030
I bet you came prepared to say that today.

79
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,000
- Just get at it. - Get at it.

80
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,840
(The lesson has already started.)

81
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,100
"Just get at it."

82
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,240
I think you are perfect for our show...

83
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,780
because you've been going viral these days.

84
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,010
Hasn't he changed a bit?

85
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,650
You have more hair on your head.

86
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,180
That's right.

87
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,120
I got myself a fur hat.

88
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,420
- Good choice. - You can't tell.

89
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,050
- Isn't it perfect? - You really can't tell.

90
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,320
Why do you have those sunglasses on though?

91
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,590
- They look like goggles. - They don't mean anything.

92
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,290
- I see. - I thought I'd protect...

93
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,660
my eyes from Taeyang.

94
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,030
(Taeyang's learning a lot.)

95
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,730
You know how UV rays can sting.

96
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,900
(It's another lesson learned.)

97
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,340
You really came prepared today.

98
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,270
Everything you say is worth writing down.

99
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,570
(They're all addicted to Heung Kook's puns.)

100
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,080
Taeyang released a new single,

101
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,810
and G-Dragon's been avidly promoting it.

102
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,320
- That's right. - Via social media, of course.

103
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,190
So since it's a new single, we should definitely hear it.

104
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,220
What's it called?

105
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,860
It's called "Darling".

106
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,590
- "Darling"? - Yes, "Darling".

107
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,330
This'll be the first time singing it live.

108
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,400
- The first time. - We're the first ones to hear it.

109
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,660
- That's right. - So here's "Darling".

110
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,300
(He's singing "Darling" live for the first time.)

111
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,970
It's his first time.

112
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,870
(He's nervous.)

113
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,240
This is unbelievable.

114
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,070
I'm so glad I joined this company.

115
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,640
We should record this.

116
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,550
("Darling" by Taeyang)

117
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,460
(His sorrowful voice touches our hearts.)

118
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,810
(Amazed)

119
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,320
(It's like hearing the song from a CD.)

120
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,250
Are you sure this is live?

121
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,770
(We need to record this on our phones.)

122
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,630
(He pretends to play the piano.)

123
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,540
(It's as if we're at his concert.)

124
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,950
(They're all absorbed in his song.)

125
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,120
(You're the only one for me)

126
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,560
(Taeyang has a dominant voice.)

127
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,200
- Darling! - You sounded just like the CD.

128
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,270
Didn't you hear me ask if this was a live performance?

129
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,100
Was this really the first time?

130
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,840
- Was this really the first time? - I couldn't believe it.

131
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,940
He's never sang it live before.

132
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,770
- He wasn't even warmed up. - Darling!

133
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,510
(Darling!)

134
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
Sorry?

135
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,880
- What? - Say that again.

136
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,150
Darling! Isn't that how you sang?

137
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,880
The artists who sings like that is Jeon In Gwon.

138
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,580
Kyung Hwan, just read a book.

139
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,790
No wonder people say he's the best.

140
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,860
Thank you for that.

141
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,160
He practically only sang to a piano accompaniment.

142
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,030
Now it's Heung Kook's turn.

143
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,530
I haven't released a new song though.

144
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,430
I'm finding confidence, I'm finding confidence.

145
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,700
- Right. - Can you sing...

146
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,470
"Tiger Swallowtail" to a piano accompaniment?

147
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,340
Play it for me then.

148
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,740
I'm afraid we don't have one ready.

149
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,180
- Gosh. - Call Kim Gun Mo instead then.

150
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,240
(If that's not an option...)

151
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,610
(Did you say, Kim Gun Mo?)

152
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,250
You want Gun Mo to play the piano for you?

153
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,250
Yes.

154
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,820
- Why not? - Now that's absurd.

155
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,190
Why would he even come?

156
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,120
We sing together after a few drinks.

157
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,090
(Like this?)

158
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,030
(The collaboration of a legendary singer and...)

159
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,930
(the Director of the Korea Singers Association)

160
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,800
(We'd love to see it too.)

161
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,000
You just heard Taeyang...

162
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,970
sing his song just to a piano.

163
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,240
- Were you amazed? - He sounded like...

164
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,710
a globally acclaimed artist.

165
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,010
- Thank you. - It was fantastic.

166
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,510
Yes, I agree.

167
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,710
To be honest, you two...

168
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,420
are already known by almost everyone in Korea.

169
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,690
So why is there a need to film a new PR video?

170
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,090
A what?

171
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,420
(What are you talking about?)

172
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,760
He doesn't know what he's doing here.

173
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,230
PR videos are...

174
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,730
On this show, we come up with PR videos...

175
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,530
that'll help you be more popular than you are.

176
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,170
Can we sing "Taeyang Swallowtail" then?

177
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,340
- "Taeyang Swallowtail"? - Yes.

178
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,470
- Hold on. - "Taeyang Swallowtail"?

179
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,210
He just gave me a great idea.

180
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,610
Will Taeyang join you...

181
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,440
when you perform "Tiger Swallowtail"?

182
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,380
Taeyang swallowtail

183
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,920
(Heung Kook and Taeyang are already partying.)

184
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,520
A single butterfly

185
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,820
At a field of flowers

186
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,320
Nice!

187
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,260
(This is perfect for a PR video.)

188
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,220
Go, Taeyang swallowtail

189
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,690
I'd like that idea for myself.

190
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,960
- "Taeyang Swallowtail". - I'll be the one to work on that.

191
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,960
Then...

192
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,430
Our team will take that idea.

193
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,670
- But... - Why is it yours?

194
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,400
We called dibs on it.

195
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,300
Kyu Han said so first.

196
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,300
Since when have we allowed dibs?

197
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,810
Dibs!

198
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,410
(Here.)

199
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,340
I call dibs!

200
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,240
- Hold on. - This is unbelievable.

201
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,950
- The clients... - Speed is of the essence.

202
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,050
Whomever claims the idea faster...

203
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,720
- will have the right to... - I'm sorry,

204
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,150
- but Team Two is right. - Why?

205
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,890
- They responded quicker. - It was such a good idea.

206
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,820
They snatched up the idea immediately.

207
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,630
The team that makes it work better should take the idea.

208
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,960
- That's only fair. - Our team has Eun Hyuk.

209
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,360
Bring me some noodles first.

210
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
All of a sudden?

211
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,670
We'll make sure that Gun Mo plays the piano...

212
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,940
while you sing "Taeyang Swallowtail".

213
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,310
Eun Hyuk, can you be responsible for your words?

214
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,680
- No, I can't. - This can't be a joke.

215
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,880
Gosh, I'm sorry.

216
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,080
("Taeyang Swallowtail" belongs to Team Two.)

217
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,120
Before we make the PR videos,

218
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,620
- we'll first do some research. - Sure.

219
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,320
Let's start with Heung Kook's memes.

220
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,590
In order to see them, you have to say a command.

221
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,960
A command?

222
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,160
You can't command people around these days.

223
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,800
- What? - I'm sorry.

224
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,160
- Did you hear that? - We...

225
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,330
(They burst into laughter.)

226
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,970
We end up explaining this every week.

227
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,070
Since that's the case,

228
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,210
let's just bring in our next clients.

229
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,280
- You did great today. - Can I go already?

230
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,410
- Thank you for coming. - Thanks, Taeyang.

231
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,650
- He might go for real. - Stop him.

232
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,750
- He might leave. - Thank you, Taeyang.

233
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,750
- He might go for real. - Stop him.

234
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,420
Memes are what we call short videos.

235
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,860
"What's my meme?" Just say that adorably.

236
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,860
Fine.

237
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,360
(Does he understand the rules?)

238
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,860
Heung Kook...

239
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,370
is five and a half.

240
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,140
(He still doesn't understand.)

241
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,400
He didn't get it at all.

242
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,770
- He's clueless. - It's still good though.

243
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,720
(Kim Heung Kook on variety shows)

244
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,320
(He wanted to be on "Top 10 Artist Award".)

245
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,350
I'd be the sole master of the stage.

246
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,660
What if you're not nominated?

247
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,830
I'll pluck out my mustache.

248
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,730
(Laughing)

249
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,730
(He revealed that his wife is pregnant.)

250
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,940
It's been three months. I'll be a father next year.

251
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,970
Unlike other ordinary babies,

252
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,840
- your baby will cry in a funny way. - Then how?

253
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,410
(Yes, I'm wailing!)

254
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,650
(This is how the legendary catchphrase came to.)

255
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,190
So that's how the catchphrase came to.

256
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,620
(It wasn't just that though.)

257
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,190
(He had many other catchphrases too.)

258
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,260
Yes, I'm a baby!

259
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,930
A baby.

260
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,600
(Grunting)

261
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,310
(The legend of variety shows)

262
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,110
When was that?

263
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,510
- It was back in 1990. - 1990?

264
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,450
You look like a different man.

265
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,320
People ate up everything I said back then.

266
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,790
It's been a while though. Taeyang, have you seen that?

267
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,790
No, I haven't.

268
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,060
How old were you back then?

269
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,760
- I was 2. - 2?

270
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,730
You have become a different man.

271
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,700
You're able to sit still now, but you couldn't back then.

272
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,330
- I know. - This is how you were like.

273
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,440
It's like you didn't know what to do with your body.

274
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,810
I was there as a singer, not a comedian.

275
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,640
Was it because you were nervous?

276
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,540
To survive in the industry,

277
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,880
I had to do something to grab attention.

278
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,110
"I'd be the sole master of the stage."

279
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,980
You're not a comedian,

280
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,450
but you still have many catchphrases.

281
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,150
What else do you have apart from what we saw?

282
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,990
- "Just get at it." - Right.

283
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,360
- "I'm finding confidence." - That too.

284
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,930
- It's from "Reggae Party". - It goes like this.

285
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,100
- You have to roll your tongue. - She's quite good.

286
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,730
Like this.

287
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,170
This is how you do it.

288
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,170
That's right. My gosh.

289
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,200
(While the others are enjoying themselves...)

290
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,210
Could you perhaps say them in the form of a medley?

291
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,110
If you do, we'll use that to...

292
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,080
Is he the police or something?

293
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,180
(Flustered)

294
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,050
It's a good source for your PR video.

295
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,350
Look at him blush.

296
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,960
I didn't come here to be interrogated.

297
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,860
- He's flustered. - How can I be the police?

298
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,760
Don't corner him or he'll cry.

299
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,100
- Really? - Yes, he might cry.

300
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,330
(Sniffing)

301
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,230
He's really crying!

302
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,500
(Fascinating)

303
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,740
Don't make fun of me.

304
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,000
- Kyung Hwan. - Yes?

305
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,640
You know, shows must be fun.

306
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,910
Did you hear that?

307
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,780
I have a lot of catchphrases.

308
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,180
- Ask me to say them all together. - He told a comedian to be funny.

309
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,080
You sounded like you were investigating him.

310
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,380
- Right. Be more like Eun Hyuk. - Okay, I got it.

311
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,780
- Let me give this a shot. - Okay.

312
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,320
- I'm about to lose my part. - Great job.

313
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,290
- Great. - Heung Kook.

314
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,990
- You have a lot of catchphrases. - I do.

315
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,620
- We all want a catchphrase. - That's right.

316
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,790
- He's good. - It's hard to get one.

317
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,560
- It's not easy. - Can we have a relay of them?

318
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,560
(Perfect)

319
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,830
Look how friendly he was.

320
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,600
- He's good. - You liked his version more?

321
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,830
- Kyung Hwan. - Wait.

322
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,740
- What are you doing? He's good. - Hold on a second.

323
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,270
I can do it well too.

324
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,870
I was just getting to that, Heung Kook.

325
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,780
Why don't you show us all of your catchphrases at once?

326
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,510
- Is this how should I say it? - Look at him sweating.

327
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,710
I can see sweat on his nose from here.

328
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,320
- Okay, I got it. - He's sweating?

329
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,380
Why don't you do what Eun Hyuk asked you to do?

330
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,250
- Then your catchphrases... - At that time,

331
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,220
I used the word, "almost" very often.

332
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,360
- "Almost"? - "Almost"?

333
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,390
It's almost my solo performance.

334
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,630
Solo performance.

335
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,930
- It's almost a work of art. - Almost?

336
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,800
- Almost. - I used this word often.

337
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,870
With the song, "Tiger Swallowtail", I managed to perform in the US.

338
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,300
You went to the US?

339
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,440
At that time,

340
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,610
- only I ruled Southeast Asia. - That's true.

341
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,880
When he was popular, I was in elementary school.

342
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,280
When we had a talent show, 9 out of 10 students...

343
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,810
- sang "Tiger Swallowtail". - That's so true.

344
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,320
- Everyone did his dance. - At that time,

345
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,780
the word, "butterfly effect" was derived.

346
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,450
- Butterfly effect? That's right. - Yes.

347
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,950
(Eun Hyuk is getting used to this futuristic, variety show.)

348
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,090
Butterfly effect?

349
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,890
Actually, when I was young, my mom would watch the TV...

350
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,330
and see Heung Kook dancing to the song.

351
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,460
- And she'd copy his dance. - Your mom did my dance?

352
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,870
- Then she's an amazing person. - Your mom danced to his song?

353
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,330
- Your mom copied his dance? - Your mom danced to his song?

354
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,200
No, I copied his dance. I did his dance.

355
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,240
It wasn't your mom.

356
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,270
(He's unpredictable.)

357
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:44,040
Anyway, I went to the US to perform for the first time.

358
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,880
Other singers go to the US with at least 2 or 3 hit songs.

359
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,480
At that time, I only had one hit song.

360
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,620
- I couldn't sing an encore. - You had no song to sing.

361
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,820
So I sang "Tiger Swallowtail" twice.

362
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,020
- This is history. - Goodness, it is indeed.

363
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:01,460
After the show in the US, I returned to Korea. When I was on a show,

364
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,760
the host asked how my show was in the US.

365
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,960
I said it was almost like a solo performance.

366
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,460
That's when I used the line for the first time.

367
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,660
- That's how the line came about. - That's how you used the line.

368
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,470
- "Almost like a solo performance". - What other catchphrases are there?

369
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,340
If we waste this much time just to listen to his catchphrases...

370
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,740
When we are done listening to his catchphrases, our show will be over.

371
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,510
It's because he has stories behind those catchphrases.

372
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:21,210
We heard stories about the wailing and solo performance.

373
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,810
How did "I'm feeling confident" come about?

374
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,050
- I'm feeling confident? - Yes.

375
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,110
- He has a lot. - Of course.

376
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,650
- How was the line created? - I'm sorry.

377
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,180
I'm sorry to interrupt, but this isn't yours.

378
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,550
You're supposed to share them.

379
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,920
Why are you making such a big deal out of this?

380
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,620
(Why are you making such a big deal out of this?)

381
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,890
- Please share them. - Is your show struggling?

382
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,330
- Is our show struggling? - We are struggling.

383
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,430
Your catchphrases aren't the only things that you are famous for.

384
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,500
I hear that you have a license that gets you off work early.

385
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,140
He does have a license for that.

386
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,640
I got off work early a lot last year.

387
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,470
From what I've heard, when you starred on "Sunday Night"...

388
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,880
with Choi Jin Sil,

389
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,650
you left the shoot early because it was...

390
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:58,950
- too boring. - How do you know that?

391
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,950
- You guys researched thoroughly. - Yes, we did.

392
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,890
- This story is hard to believe. - This really happened?

393
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,960
It was when Jin Sil was really popular.

394
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,590
She and Joo Byung Jin was talking,

395
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,160
but they kept talking about boring stuff, so I left.

396
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,660
I let them talk to each other.

397
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,800
I went thinking who would watch a boring show like that.

398
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,370
- But... - Don't you usually get fired...

399
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,570
- or banned from starring on shows? - That's right.

400
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,740
They don't ban me as long as I'm an asset.

401
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,110
(They don't ban me as long as I'm an asset.)

402
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,650
(Heung Kook is at another level.)

403
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,010
- You're so cool. - You're confident.

404
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,420
What do you think is the secret to your popularity?

405
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,320
- It's my innocence and honesty. - Sorry?

406
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,890
- You're innocent? - He's honest and down-to-earth.

407
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,290
- I don't play mind games. - He's innocent.

408
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,860
I present myself as I am.

409
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,090
- He doesn't hide his feelings. - That's right.

410
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,560
- He gives his honest opinions. - Yes.

411
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,400
You know Taeyang just released a new song?

412
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,900
- How is the song? - When I heard it,

413
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,870
if I didn't like it, I would've said, "I enjoyed it."

414
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,170
- I would only say that to him. - But?

415
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,640
When he sang the song,

416
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,980
the song got me hooked. It was the best.

417
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,040
- Goodness. - He's so honest.

418
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,310
- Then... - I can feel that you're sincere.

419
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,220
- Right! I ought to be sincere. - We...

420
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,320
- I see. - Jae Hoon, be sincere on TV.

421
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,250
(Jae Hoon, be sincere on TV.)

422
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,490
- Me? - Didn't that surprise you?

423
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,320
- He wants you to be sincere. - Why is he calling me out?

424
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,760
(His charms are innocence and sincerity.)

425
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,030
Putting that aside, on the shows,

426
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,700
- you’ve made many funny mistakes. - There are tons.

427
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,100
- There are countless mistakes. - Mistakes made some people popular.

428
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,970
Cho Sae Ho is an example.

429
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,170
Didn't you make him into a man who never attends ceremonies?

430
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,410
(It was during his appearance on "3 Wheels" in 2015.)

431
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,220
(Sae Ho said how he always attended ceremonies.)

432
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,050
Why didn't you come to Ahn Jae Wook's wedding?

433
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,520
- Whose wedding? - Jae Wook's wedding.

434
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,090
I don't know him. How can I attend his wedding?

435
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,490
(I don't know him. How can I attend his wedding?)

436
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,060
(It's hilarious.)

437
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,190
You don't know him?

438
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,230
(Flustered)

439
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,400
(In 2016, this clip had become quite famous.)

440
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,900
- It was his turning point in life. - I bet.

441
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,770
To be honest,

442
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,870
that wasn't your intention. You just made a mistake.

443
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,140
- It was done on purpose. - Exactly.

444
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,940
Be honest and answer this.

445
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,310
That's a good question.

446
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,810
What actually happened was that Kim Gu Ra wanted me...

447
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:14,980
- to help him since he's struggling. - He wanted you to help Sae Ho.

448
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,620
- Gu Ra asked you for a favor. - I didn't know this happened.

449
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,790
I said, "Why are you not popular?"

450
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,560
- You work hard. - "Why are you not popular"?

451
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,360
I asked him how he wasn't popular already.

452
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,990
He should've met Taeyang. He would've been popular quickly.

453
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,160
He should've met him.

454
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,560
- He's taking care of Taeyang. - He's talking about everything.

455
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,900
So I asked him why he didn't come to Jae Wook's wedding.

456
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,470
He told me he didn't know Jae Took.

457
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,940
Let me tell you how big of an impact of Sae Ho's new character left.

458
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,410
- It was impactful. - On his social media account,

459
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,410
the comments for the posts Sae Ho uploads were...

460
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,580
asking why he didn't come to their birthday.

461
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,780
- There were tons of comments. - That's true.

462
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,090
- I agree. - It was funny. I wrote a comment.

463
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,460
- On which post? What did you write? - What did you write?

464
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,160
Our group had a fan meet, but he didn't come.

465
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,100
(He didn't come to what?)

466
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,830
He probably wasn't invited.

467
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,770
(Why didn't you come to our fan meet in Japan?)

468
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,000
(It's the comment Taeyang wrote.)

469
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,070
- He didn't go. - He should've gone to the meet.

470
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,840
- It would be disappointing. - "Why didn't you come"?

471
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,870
- Really? - I really left the comment.

472
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,010
Where should Sae Ho go then?

473
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,110
- I'm so curious. - I got a lot of offers for ads.

474
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,950
We only filmed one commercial together.

475
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,350
I think without me knowing, he filmed about 10 commercials.

476
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,650
(Sae Ho had the commercials to himself.)

477
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,290
- That must've hurt your feelings. - Gook Ju, when you see him,

478
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,690
tell him not to shoot commercials alone.

479
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,530
Heung Kook, but the thing is that he's not famous for that anymore.

480
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,230
I don't think you'll get offers. You should've done that earlier.

481
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,000
- That fad is over. - That's true.

482
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,870
- You'll get another one. - Now, you should make a new one.

483
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,870
- Make one on our show. - Please do it for us.

484
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,470
It was hard enough to make one character famous. How can I...

485
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:45,470
- He also makes slips of the tongue. - He makes a lot of them.

486
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,810
The title of Gummy's song was "We Should've Been Friends".

487
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,950
He said it was "We Should've Been Spiders" by Friends.

488
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,450
- This is a famous example. - He made the mistake on the radio.

489
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,020
He said, "BT Vest" instead of "BTS".

490
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,390
(List of his mistakes)

491
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,820
That was just terrible.

492
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,720
- The title was "Childish Wife". - What was his mistake?

493
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,160
He said, "Hairless Wife".

494
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,590
- These are the mistakes he made. - That's right.

495
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,360
This is my first time telling you this.

496
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,660
I'll say this for the sake of your show.

497
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,370
One time, I introduced BigBang's song on the radio show.

498
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,870
- Okay. - It's the first time hearing it.

499
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,970
- I made a mistake at first. - What did you say?

500
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,440
I said it was BakBing's song.

501
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,610
(I said it was BakBing's song.)

502
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,380
(Laughing)

503
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,610
BakBing?

504
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,710
- This is BakBing! - Here is BakBing!

505
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,280
- BakBing. - I'm sorry. I said it wrong once.

506
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,190
I said the wrong name for their group.

507
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,290
But you just read the script wrong, didn't you?

508
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,990
- You didn't do it on purpose. - No, it wasn't intentional.

509
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,990
I didn't plan on it.

510
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,460
Right now, they can type the screen on computer screens,

511
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,160
but at that time, the producer wrote the script by hand.

512
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,770
That's why I mispronounced Turbo's song, "Cyber Lover".

513
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,200
He's right.

514
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,840
- You mispronounced UCLA too. - Sorry?

515
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,170
- I mispronounced UCLA too. - UCLA?

516
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,310
The biggest mistake was...

517
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,270
when I read one of the letters wrong.

518
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,710
- The producer wrote it sloppily. - "Hairless Wife".

519
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,980
But you should've questioned if you read it correctly at least once.

520
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,750
Had I read the script in advance, I'd have been okay, but I didn't.

521
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,120
- I don't read scripts. - That's my point.

522
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,390
How did "BT Vest" come about?

523
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,760
- That was... - He only read up to BT.

524
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,720
It was when my daughter was in the US.

525
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,930
She's very interested in K-Pop.

526
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:15,230
She told me that lately she liked BTS.

527
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,970
I told her I'd play their song on my radio show in Korea.

528
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,800
- But I couldn't memorize the name. - BTS?

529
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,340
- You remembered BT though. - He only knew BT.

530
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,970
- I memorized up to BT. - It was BTS.

531
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,640
My daughter requested this song.

532
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,810
It's by BT Vest. Wait, no. That's not it.

533
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,520
Shall we listen to "I Need You" by BTS?

534
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,680
How can a vest sing a song?

535
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,390
I'd like to ask you this.

536
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,590
There was a program called "I Am a Singer".

537
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,990
I heard the show tried to cast you,

538
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,960
but why did you turn it down?

539
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,300
I didn't turn it down.

540
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,470
When they contacted me,

541
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,930
I told them that I was already a singer.

542
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,640
(I told them that I was already a singer.)

543
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,570
- It was a simple thought. - That was why.

544
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:57,110
I told them I was already a singer.

545
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,840
You didn't star on it because the title was "I Am a Singer", right?

546
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,210
- That's right. - You were already a singer.

547
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,950
I already became a singer.

548
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,750
- I've never thought it like that. - Me neither.

549
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,880
You're so cool.

550
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,980
Aren't I right?

551
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,320
- See? He acknowledged me. - Taeyang is awesome.

552
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,390
You are so cool.

553
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,260
What if the title was, "Are You a Singer"?

554
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,460
- "Are You a Singer"? - Yes.

555
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,160
- "Are You Still a Singer"? - That sounds a bit insulting.

556
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,860
- Since they are questioning me, - Will you star to prove yourself?

557
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,600
- I should show them I'm a singer. - You will star for that?

558
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,960
- When they look down on you... - I'm the Top 10 artist.

559
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,400
- "Am I a Singer"? - I would've never thought that.

560
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,270
Heung Kook has a lot of pride...

561
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:30,340
and self-respect as a singer.

562
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,440
Since we're on the subject, let me tell you this.

563
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,110
You know how comedians...

564
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:38,550
get together and support each other?

565
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,080
I really like how united they are.

566
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,290
But singers work individually.

567
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,660
We perform by ourselves, and there's no opportunities for us to meet.

568
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,690
That's true.

569
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,090
So when singers are trying to do something,

570
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,500
I'd like to help them unconditionally. That's my point.

571
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,960
- I see. - Did I make sense to you?

572
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,570
- Yes. - Taeyang is very loyal too.

573
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,730
When he heard you'd be starring, he accepted the offer to star together.

574
00:22:58,730 --> 00:22:59,740
- He's so loyal. - He is indeed.

575
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,000
- We... - Anyway.

576
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,510
must be grateful to him and realize how lucky we are.

577
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,880
You mean the real sun, the meaning of Taeyang's name?

578
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,680
Imagine it rains all the time.

579
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,910
- If it rains every day, - He literally means the sun.

580
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:10,980
- you'll get depressed. - Right.

581
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,750
- Heung Kook... - I don't want a world without days.

582
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,050
literally means the sun, not Taeyang himself.

583
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,050
Right. He's talking about the sun.

584
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:19,620
I think he means that we should be grateful to the sun.

585
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,290
Then shall we move on to Taeyang's meme naturally?

586
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,660
- Since we're at it. - Since we're already at it.

587
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,560
- I can't wait. - Let's watch the first one...

588
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,430
of his best memes now.

589
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,270
You know what to say.

590
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,070
What's my meme?

591
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,670
(He's got the swag.)

592
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,680
(Taeyang sounds like he swallowed his CD.)

593
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:44,450
("Eyes, Nose, Lips" by Taeyang)

594
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,780
(This song describes Taeyang's style very well.)

595
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,020
(Copying Taeyang)

596
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,960
He has a great body.

597
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,390
It's such a nice music video.

598
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:58,260
(Singing live without instrumental accompaniment in Japan Dome Tour)

599
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,160
It's a video clip of his singing live.

600
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,560
He sounds the same.

601
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,570
He sounds the same as the CD.

602
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,800
(He sounds just like the CD.)

603
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,110
(He sings perfectly well even in a huge venue.)

604
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:15,680
(Immersed in Taeyang's song)

605
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,420
(Feeling shy)

606
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,850
(Amazed)

607
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,490
Taeyang! Taeyang!

608
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,560
- That was awesome. - But...

609
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,230
doesn't he have any funny clips?

610
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,490
- No. That is all we got. - Really?

611
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,600
- That's it? - Yes. He is just cool.

612
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,700
You also monitor your videos,

613
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,270
- don't you? - Yes.

614
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,070
- Then I bet there are funny clips. - Sure.

615
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,710
Are there any funny clips you remember?

616
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,680
When I decided to shoot Make me Viral, I wanted to find some too.

617
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,180
But because I had not been on variety shows for quite a long time,

618
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,820
I couldn't remember funny videos.

619
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,790
I couldn't remember any particular clip.

620
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,550
So did you want to find some funny clips or...

621
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,120
the ones where you make mistakes?

622
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,990
- Yes. - You mean you wish you had them?

623
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,590
- Yes, I do. - There must be some.

624
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:07,660
Are you usually quiet?

625
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,970
Or do you like being funny?

626
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,600
Usually, I like being funny and playful.

627
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,140
- You do? - I know he likes playing jokes.

628
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,240
- You are lively and humorous? - Yes.

629
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,710
He plays jokes on the other members a lot.

630
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:22,140
When I hang out with my friends in private,

631
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,880
they say I play dad jokes a lot.

632
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,050
- I'm the one who started dad jokes. - Yes.

633
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:30,150
That's why I like Heung Kook very much.

634
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,550
He is hilarious.

635
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,890
People don't like my dad jokes a lot though.

636
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:34,890
But do you keep playing jokes?

637
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,260
Yes, I do.

638
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,760
If you keep doing it, they'll eventually like it.

639
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,200
- Sure. - You've got to keep going.

640
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,770
Who likes your jokes the most among your members?

641
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:46,670
They think they lose when they laugh at my jokes.

642
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,040
- They don't laugh. - On purpose.

643
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,570
- They think it hurts their pride. - They try not to laugh.

644
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,380
- Right. - They laugh at my joke and say,

645
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,780
- "Gosh. I lost." - Then...

646
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,510
who laughs the most among the members...

647
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,550
- when you say that? - G-Dragon laughs the most.

648
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,080
Then do two of you have the same taste?

649
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,820
No, we don't.

650
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,290
But he giggles and then regrets a lot.

651
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,930
It's a project we need to work hard on.

652
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:13,230
It is a long-term project.

653
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,430
- So... - We have long intestines too.

654
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:18,000
(Laughing)

655
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,800
(Seung Ri skips the joke and keeps on talking.)

656
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,510
(Why don't we play chess for a long time after this?)

657
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,410
Then how does she react...

658
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,980
to your jokes?

659
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,620
In fact, her reactions are quite cold.

660
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,450
- Quite cold? - Yes.

661
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,520
(They're asking about Hyo Rin.)

662
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:39,320
But that makes me want to say even more jokes.

663
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,220
- You don't want to give up. - I want to get recognition.

664
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,990
- I see. - So I keep telling jokes,

665
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,890
but she doesn't acknowledge them.

666
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,260
- You don't need to care about that. - Okay.

667
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,560
- You should keep telling jokes. - I should?

668
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,130
Then after a while, cold people...

669
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,130
- will also laugh in the end. - In the end.

670
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,800
A moment ago, you said...

671
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,210
that you don't have any funny videos, right?

672
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:01,810
- Yes. - Then do you remember any mistakes?

673
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,710
Mistakes on stage? Oh, I remember one.

674
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,920
We had a concert and performed a lot at the end of the year.

675
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,290
Maybe because I overexerted myself,

676
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,120
my throat was not in good condition.

677
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,730
It's possible at the end of the year.

678
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,890
While I was encouraging the audience to cheer,

679
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,460
my voice got out of tune drastically.

680
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,060
- Drastically. - Yes.

681
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,630
- While you were encouraging people? - Yes.

682
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,470
When I gave that exclamation,

683
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,940
the other members laughed a lot because it sounded funny.

684
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:33,780
It was "Day by Day" and they started to laugh while dancing.

685
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,910
It was a lyrical and serious song.

686
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,150
- You were not supposed to laugh. - Right.

687
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:41,280
But they burst into laughter, so I still remember that.

688
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,390
(While singing the lyrical song, "Day by Day",)

689
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,760
(Taeyang's exclamation got out of tune.)

690
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,660
(Seung Ri looks at Taeyang.)

691
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,060
(When they look at each other, they burst into laughter.)

692
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,360
(Laughing)

693
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,830
(Laughing)

694
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,240
(Their eyes meet.)

695
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,910
(G-Dragon comes out to the center with a big smile on his face.)

696
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,580
- Then... - Let's check out his funny...

697
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,210
videos later on the show.

698
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,450
For now, let's see how cool he is.

699
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:17,820
- Like what? - A medley of his solo songs.

700
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,260
You will be able to listen to his great songs.

701
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,260
Really?

702
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,060
Just one of his songs would make my heart flutter but is it a medley?

703
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,830
That sounds great.

704
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,630
- He picked up his mic. - It's almost like a concert today.

705
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:31,030
You need a female partner in your solo songs.

706
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,540
Do you remember the time?

707
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,440
- Yes. The award ceremony. - Right.

708
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,440
- Have you performed together? - Cho Sae Ho...

709
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,970
sang "Eyes, Nose, Lips"...

710
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,780
and I played a role of a female.

711
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,810
I said I played a role of a female when I'm already a female.

712
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,650
I performed it back then.

713
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:47,780
- If you need me, I'll be there. - All right.

714
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:53,260
(Taeyang's mini concert)

715
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,030
He just turned back and he's already cool.

716
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:58,790
(Looking so cool)

717
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,100
(It's time to fall for Taeyang's swagger.)

718
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:09,710
("Only Look at Me" by Taeyang)

719
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,780
(Immersed)

720
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,110
(Though I may forget you)

721
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,980
(You shouldn't forget me)

722
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:24,620
(Taeyang's unrivaled groove)

723
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,790
(Letting out his cool vibes)

724
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,030
(Screaming)

725
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,530
(Exclaiming)

726
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:41,240
("I Need a Girl" by Taeyang)

727
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,110
(They're all falling for Taeyang's songs.)

728
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,550
(Here comes the female partner.)

729
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,850
(He doesn't get flustered and looks natural.)

730
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,570
(Fatally attractive)

731
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,570
Gook Ju must be so happy.

732
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,200
(After the fatally attractive girl left,)

733
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,070
("Eyes, Nose, Lips" by Taeyang)

734
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,240
(a man misses her.)

735
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,380
(So sorrowful)

736
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,190
(She suddenly acts while he is singing.)

737
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,920
(She is totally into the role.)

738
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,430
(But his great singing skills are not affected at all.)

739
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,830
(Gently looking at her.)

740
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:46,700
(It was Taeyang's mini concert full of soul music.)

741
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,270
Great job.

742
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,670
I'm so honored.

743
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,110
- It's an honor. - It sure is.

744
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,580
- I wish we could see some more. - I'm really honored.

745
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,280
Such a cool man was singing for you...

746
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,050
but why did you keep pushing him away?

747
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:01,120
So that he can focus on singing, I tried not to show my face.

748
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,550
I was worried he might burst into laughter.

749
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,320
- In fact... - That was the reason.

750
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,920
When I appear in the middle of songs, accidents usually happen.

751
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,630
He didn't get flustered at all but embraced me.

752
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,060
So I feel so grateful.

753
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,330
(While he was singing,)

754
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,200
(Gook Ju approached him.)

755
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,370
(And he collaborated with her smoothly.)

756
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,870
Gook Ju made Taeyang's performance even better.

757
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,570
- Thank you. - He doesn't make mistakes at all.

758
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:24,870
- Right. - He's a professional.

759
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:27,280
Sometimes, there are a few fans who break into stages.

760
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,550
- Yes. - Were there some naughty fans?

761
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,180
I think there was no one in Korea.

762
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,380
But there are some overseas fans...

763
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,290
- Right. - that are more enthusiastic.

764
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,690
Some of them really...

765
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,990
- try to come up... - They do.

766
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,130
on the stage.

767
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,330
Once a fan came up on the stage and we danced with him...

768
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:51,400
as if it were a part of the performance.

769
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,470
- Looking natural? - Yes.

770
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:55,170
- Really? - It was "Fantastic Baby."

771
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,370
He came up and danced with us.

772
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,840
The security guard were about to come up to stop him...

773
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,940
- but we asked them not to come up. - You mean the security guards?

774
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,150
He just came up because he was so excited and wanted to dance.

775
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:08,020
So we danced together to "Fantastic Baby"...

776
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,720
and let him get down safely.

777
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,220
As a part of the performance.

778
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,420
There is a famous video..

779
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,990
where someone comes up and does a flying kick on the stage.

780
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,100
To the singer?

781
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,800
Yes. He was an ordinary man.

782
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,300
- Who was the singer? - He did that to the singer.

783
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,400
But there is a part even funnier. While the singer was singing,

784
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,900
the man jumped and literally did a flying kick...

785
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,510
but the singer ducked it very smoothly.

786
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,940
He ducked the kick.

787
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,880
- Really? - Yes. He was a real singer.

788
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,850
- He didn't seem to be startled. - I can't remember who it was.

789
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,880
(While Wheesung was singing on stage,)

790
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,720
(a man suddenly did a flying kick.)

791
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,820
He must be crazy.

792
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,630
(The police officer takes him away.)

793
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:56,730
(Wheesung keeps on singing as if nothing had happened)

794
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,600
Ducking the flying kick,

795
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,500
- he kept on singing. - Without stopping.

796
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,410
I think Taeyang is as good as him.

797
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:07,640
It was nice to see you get along with everyone.

798
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,680
I was surprised.

799
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,210
Taeyang says he wants to come out on entertainment shows,

800
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,680
but the show he watches the most...

801
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,320
is Choi Bool Am's "Korean Food Table".

802
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,120
- I love it. - It's addictive.

803
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,990
- I like it a lot. - I like it too.

804
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,360
- Do you catch it on air? - If I...

805
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,290
miss the air time, I watch a rerun.

806
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,600
I watch it while I eat.

807
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,470
- Do you like to eat? - Yes, I do.

808
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,170
- Do you search for good eats? - Yes.

809
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:33,100
There are a lot of food based shows.

810
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,110
Is there a reason why you like "Korean Food Table"?

811
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,910
On other food shows,

812
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,180
you can easily find the restaurant and go there to eat.

813
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,510
- Yes. - For "Korean Food Table",

814
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,650
you can't eat it unless you go to that person's house.

815
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,580
- That's right. - "Korean Food Table".

816
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,550
Taeyang, if you love food so much,

817
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,690
are you a good cook? Do you cook often?

818
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,420
- Yes, I cook... - Is it a hobby?

819
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,490
I'm not very good at it, but I enjoy cooking.

820
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:59,860
When I'm home alone, I make kimchi jjigae often.

821
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,530
- There are various kinds. - What do you like the most?

822
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,100
- The pork kimchi jjigae. - Of course.

823
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,370
You need pork in it.

824
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,470
- You need pork shoulder. - Of course.

825
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:10,440
Taeyang cooks?

826
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:11,740
Do you also drink?

827
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,180
- I'm not a good drinker. - No?

828
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,810
Someone could teach you.

829
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,050
Teach him?

830
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,550
- Who could teach him? - Why?

831
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,380
Maybe his body just doesn't like taking it.

832
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,820
You can't be a good drinker from the start.

833
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,150
I stopped drinking.

834
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,560
After I stopped,

835
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,160
I felt my body change.

836
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,890
Didn't you stop because of your debt?

837
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:31,530
(Didn't you stop because of your debt?)

838
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,100
(Sweating)

839
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,530
Actually,

840
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:38,270
Psy found out...

841
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:41,370
that I'm not a good drinker.

842
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:45,140
I don't enjoy drinking, so I don't know my limit.

843
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,110
You can only know if you drank before.

844
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,710
When I told him I didn't know,

845
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,750
that's what I meant.

846
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:53,250
I told him I never got drunk before.

847
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,050
Then Psy thought it was great and invited me to his house.

848
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:57,490
He thought you were a good drinker.

849
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,920
When I came to my senses,

850
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,590
we drank eight bottles of wine.

851
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,790
- He's good. He drank wine. - You're heavyweight.

852
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,100
You're a good drinker.

853
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,830
You're not a bad drinker. You just never drink.

854
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,230
He knows how to drink wine.

855
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,430
Eight bottles can kill you.

856
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:13,440
After that, I got sick of drinking.

857
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,900
- How many days were you out? - It was too much.

858
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,240
For about 2 to 3 days.

859
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,810
Do you turn red when you drink?

860
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,010
I don't turn red.

861
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,540
It's hard to tell for me.

862
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,650
What do you like to snack on?

863
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,250
I like Korean food.

864
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,850
Fruits?

865
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,280
Hello?

866
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,690
He just said he likes Korean food.

867
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,190
- Hello? Are you on the phone? - I like fruits too.

868
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,090
Hello? Hello?

869
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:36,730
Jae Hoon, it's me.

870
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,290
- Yes, hello. - He's taking it.

871
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:39,530
You got the snacks wrong.

872
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,460
(Why are you bringing up fruits?)

873
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,070
(Whimpering)

874
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,700
I'm glad you brought it up.

875
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,270
He's really good at cutting fruits.

876
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,870
- Really? - Great timing.

877
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:53,180
Today's timing is amazing.

878
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,050
- He must be good with his hands. - It was smooth.

879
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,220
We want to see you cut apples,

880
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:02,150
but just watching you won't be fun. We’ve prepared a little skit.

881
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,750
Team Two prepared it.

882
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:06,560
It's about three daughters of an orchard farmer.

883
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,690
Three daughters.

884
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,460
- That's a scary setting. - Yes.

885
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,990
The three daughters compete to cut apples...

886
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,560
in order to inherit the orchard.

887
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,400
- Then... - They want the orchard.

888
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,730
they should officially apologize.

889
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:17,930
(He's just saying anything.)

890
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,800
Can Team Two take Kim Heung Kook?

891
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,240
(Please take him away.)

892
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,970
Hey, are you throwing me away?

893
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,180
It's too late to ask me.

894
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,010
Then this will be Taeyang's apology show.

895
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,720
(That's it.)

896
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,490
This is because none of you apologized on a show before.

897
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,090
That was good.

898
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,260
You guys.

899
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,760
Let me apologize.

900
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,860
(Taeyang ends it off.)

901
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,400
He's good.

902
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,730
He's good.

903
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:50,900
We have to call the secret stage...

904
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,000
- in order to start the skit. - Okay.

905
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,970
Can you do any impersonations?

906
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,370
The stage will transform if you show us something.

907
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,810
What should I say?

908
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:02,510
It doesn't matter. You can do anything.

909
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:05,380
(What will Taeyang show off first?)

910
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,850
(I'm praying)

911
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,760
He did it.

912
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,960
I'm praying

913
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,490
(Motion scanner on)

914
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,400
(Recognizing talent)

915
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,530
- Is it turning? - Is Yong Pil coming?

916
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,630
Great! It's turning.

917
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,440
Hey, is Yong Pil coming?

918
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,770
No, no.

919
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,070
Wow, trees.

920
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,140
(They can smell the apples.)

921
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,210
Everyone, it's an apple show.

922
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,150
It's an apologetic show.

923
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,550
It's here.

924
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,590
- It's a huge orchard farm. - Amazing.

925
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,290
(Dumbfounded)

926
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,090
I'll tell you your roles.

927
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:48,620
Heung Kook,

928
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,430
you're the orchard owner and father of three daughters.

929
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,630
- Jae Hoon, you're the mom. - Mom.

930
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,460
- Why am I the mom? - Is he my wife?

931
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,530
Yes, he is.

932
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,670
- You look good together. - Why would I marry him?

933
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,470
They look like a couple of 50 years.

934
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,940
Honey.

935
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,070
Honey?

936
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,480
(Singing)

937
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,280
- Honey - What is it?

938
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,750
Please, Heung Kook.

939
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,750
- Stop doing this to me. - You followed him.

940
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,690
- I'm trying to work here. - You did it too.

941
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,860
Kyu Han is the eldest daughter.

942
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,960
- Gook Ju is the middle child. - I'm glad.

943
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,490
Taeyang is the youngest.

944
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,030
If you're a woman,

945
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,600
please get your makeup on.

946
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,400
- Let's go. Mom, - No.

947
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,570
you have to get makeup on.

948
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,870
(Changing)

949
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,770
I don't get why I have to dress up when I'm already a woman.

950
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,510
Look at the youngest daughter.

951
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,650
(He has pigtails.)

952
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:46,180
- Do I look cute? - You look good.

953
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,820
(The youngest daughter is so cheerful.)

954
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,650
She's so cute.

955
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,120
(The eldest is sassy.)

956
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,760
He wanted to be more funny.

957
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,690
I don't think it'll be funny.

958
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:57,860
No.

959
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,400
I think this is better.

960
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,260
It suits me.

961
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,970
- The makeup... - It looks like mine.

962
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,670
- Good. - It's cute.

963
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,570
(The pigtails reflect his free will.)

964
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,940
- Okay. - No wonder I wanted...

965
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,540
to wear velvet today.

966
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,810
We should get off stage for now.

967
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,850
- The eldest daughter. - You can enter first.

968
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,680
Ready.

969
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,220
Action.

970
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,620
Honey.

971
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,550
(That feels good.)

972
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,160
- Honey. - Yes?

973
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,990
Today is the day. We have to settle it.

974
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,190
- We must get the orchard. - It's ours.

975
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,260
We have to take it.

976
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,960
Kyu Han likes dressing up.

977
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,970
He likes dressing as a woman.

978
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:38,370
- Kids. - Mom, we're here.

979
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,970
Hello. Welcome.

980
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:42,000
- Hello, Father. - Welcome.

981
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,470
Mom, Dad, we're here for a reason today.

982
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,510
Stop hesitating and hand the orchard to us.

983
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,280
Our kids are growing up.

984
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,880
They're going to start elementary school soon.

985
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,050
We're going to need a lot of money.

986
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,220
Honey, today is important.

987
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,820
I thought of a business plan. We have to pay off our debt.

988
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,560
There are green tea pork and wine pork.

989
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,730
What about apple pork?

990
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,530
I heard everything you said.

991
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:06,900
- Mother. I mean, Mom. - Mother.

992
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,270
If you're here, you should come in. Why are you talking outside?

993
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,530
- Are you here? - Sir.

994
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,700
Yes, we're here.

995
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,870
Good.

996
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,970
- My son-in-law is so handsome. - Mother.

997
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:17,070
Why are you guys here?

998
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,940
Why are you picking a fight?

999
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,210
- Why did you come? - What about you?

1000
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,550
I know you're living well.

1001
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:26,250
Stop fighting.

1002
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,650
(They're ready to join the war.)

1003
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,550
- Father. - Take care of your husband's debt.

1004
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,150
- Father. - What's that?

1005
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:32,820
Is that the youngest?

1006
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,220
Our youngest is here.

1007
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,590
What a show.

1008
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,160
We're in so much love.

1009
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,890
- Are you here? - Dad.

1010
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,700
- I'm glad you're here. - We're here.

1011
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,730
- Sit down. - Sit.

1012
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,530
- Mom, sit down. - I'm okay.

1013
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:46,500
Why are you all here?

1014
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,670
Don't you know the orchard will be given to us?

1015
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,270
- Come on. - It's ours.

1016
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,670
- What are you talking about? - Don't say that.

1017
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:54,080
All you have to do is sign on the waiver.

1018
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,410
We're not giving it up.

1019
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,080
I'm the eldest, so I should get it.

1020
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,880
Your youngest daughter...

1021
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:01,550
says she'll dance her heart out if she can get the orchard.

1022
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:03,390
What kind of dance was it? Show us.

1023
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,060
- Show us, honey. - If I can get the orchard...

1024
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,290
If we can get it?

1025
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,930
(This is the youngest daughter's dance.)

1026
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,660
Look at how great her dance is.

1027
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,730
That's not a dance.

1028
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:21,670
Honey, show them. You show them.

1029
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,070
You show them.

1030
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,310
- This is what you call a dance. - Show them.

1031
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,610
- This is how you do it. - Honey, don't let them win.

1032
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,750
- You should dance like this. - Honey, go.

1033
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,410
This is a real dance.

1034
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:32,520
(This 45-year-old is trying his best.)

1035
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,050
- Dancing. Dancing. - Good job.

1036
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,090
- Father. - You're so good.

1037
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:42,160
I'll explain to you why...

1038
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,760
we deserve the orchard.

1039
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,530
I sang a song called "Sorry, Sorry".

1040
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,160
It's an apologetic song.

1041
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,270
That's right.

1042
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,570
(He's doing the dance right away.)

1043
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,540
You're right.

1044
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,740
Apple, apple, apple, apple

1045
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,710
- Come on. - Apple, apple

1046
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,510
Even before "Sorry, Sorry"...

1047
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,310
I'm so sorry but I love you

1048
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:05,210
(I did it before him.)

1049
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,080
Do you have anything?

1050
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,050
I'm so apple, I'm so apple

1051
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:13,990
Apple, apple

1052
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,860
Apple, apple

1053
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,760
(It's suddenly an apologetic song.)

1054
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,030
What are you doing, honey?

1055
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,200
What did you do?

1056
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,230
- I didn't even notice. - It's okay.

1057
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,330
I raised our kids well.

1058
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:27,470
- Sit down. - Father.

1059
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,110
- We understand... - Give it to us.

1060
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,570
We know how you feel.

1061
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,440
Your father will make an important announcement.

1062
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,880
I can't farm anymore.

1063
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:39,010
It was such hard work tending to a huge orchard farm.

1064
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:40,250
Honey, you need a break.

1065
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,620
Are you planning to die?

1066
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,150
He's almost talking in his grave.

1067
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,420
The air feels so heavy.

1068
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,290
It's not that.

1069
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,290
I want to travel with your mother.

1070
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:50,690
- Yes, that's good. - Good.

1071
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:51,860
You should take a break.

1072
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,600
I want to split it fairly between you three.

1073
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,560
Let's take this apple.

1074
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:57,400
Try to peel it as long as possible.

1075
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,670
- Peel it long. - Make it long.

1076
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,840
- We have to measure it. - That's a wise decision.

1077
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,570
The couple...

1078
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,570
will get this orchard which is all my fortune.

1079
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:06,780
This apple orchard.

1080
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,710
All right. Hold an apple in your hand.

1081
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,250
- Let's begin. - What should I do?

1082
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,780
- Okay. - Hold this.

1083
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:12,920
He's good at this.

1084
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,980
Honey, have a seat.

1085
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,850
- All right. - I'll do it standing up.

1086
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:17,620
- You should do it sitting down. - Sit down.

1087
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,720
Honey, have a seat.

1088
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:23,030
I'll eat an apple while you guys are peeling them. This is for you.

1089
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:25,860
My husband still has a strong grip.

1090
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,430
Ready.

1091
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:30,430
(Who'll get the orchard as the best apple peeler?)

1092
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:32,670
Start.

1093
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,970
Take your time.

1094
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,540
Do it slowly.

1095
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,140
- In fact... - Peel it thinly.

1096
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:41,140
Taeyang has been good at peeling apples since he was young.

1097
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,850
You're off to a good start.

1098
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:43,910
(The two ladies are peeling an apple smoothly.)

1099
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,020
- Isn't it too thick? - I think it's too thick.

1100
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,190
- Taeyang is good at this. - Oh no!

1101
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,120
It's almost 5cm wide.

1102
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:53,220
Oh, no!

1103
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,490
- You should... - Wait.

1104
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,260
- Gosh. - We don't know it yet.

1105
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:58,030
Dad!

1106
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:00,600
- You'll get the orchard. - I have a crick in my hand.

1107
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,200
I have pins and needles in my legs. What should I do?

1108
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,070
She always liked to eat it but has done nothing like this before.

1109
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,970
(It looks like he's getting lessons for married life.)

1110
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,710
(Taeyang is peeling an apple with deliberation and elaboration.)

1111
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,510
Honey, I'll get the orchard!

1112
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,680
(Screaming)

1113
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,450
It's cut off. It's over.

1114
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:23,550
That's it.

1115
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:25,250
- All right. - It's done.

1116
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,990
- You did a good job. - Gosh.

1117
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:28,320
- Okay. - He's done too.

1118
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,330
- Okay. - My legs.

1119
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:32,660
My wife just finished it perfectly.

1120
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:33,660
(That's tiresome.)

1121
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,930
I'll spread it.

1122
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,600
You should be careful.

1123
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,170
It has a very thin part in the middle.

1124
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:41,400
Do you have...

1125
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:44,970
- Do you have a tapeline? - Spread it.

1126
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,680
(The immature husband just made a mess.)

1127
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,710
He made a mess.

1128
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:50,950
You can cut it now.

1129
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:51,950
Be careful.

1130
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:54,520
Cut it here.

1131
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,520
I was so nervous doing this.

1132
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:58,490
(Taeyang finally finishes it.)

1133
00:44:58,490 --> 00:44:59,720
Wait.

1134
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,520
That was so close.

1135
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,660
It didn't snap.

1136
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,230
- All right. - Look at that.

1137
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:08,160
- Look at Gook Ju's. - How do we measure it?

1138
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,270
- It's long. - She really wants the orchard.

1139
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:14,200
- We worked hard for the orchard. - I can see that.

1140
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,910
Mine is 120cm long.

1141
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:19,410
It's very long.

1142
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:22,980
Gook Ju's is 94cm long.

1143
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:27,980
Taeyang's is 98cm.

1144
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:28,980
- 98cm? - What?

1145
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:31,820
(Kyu Han wins.)

1146
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,560
Being insensitive, Kyu Han won the game.

1147
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,430
- She's the eldest daughter. - The eldest.

1148
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,490
(It's for Taeyang's PR Video. Why did you win the game?)

1149
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,860
(He feels embarrassed and uncomfortable.)

1150
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,800
She feels very uncomfortable.

1151
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,800
- All right. - Congratulations!

1152
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,900
(Such an insensitive move)

1153
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,240
- You did a good job. - Honey.

1154
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,210
You must be very happy.

1155
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:51,540
- Let's go. - I apologize.

1156
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,540
(We all apologize.)

1157
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,640
Being insensitive, I inherited the orchard.

1158
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,280
- Right. - I got it.

1159
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,120
He's mean. He's so greedy.

1160
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,720
I become very greedy when it comes to land.

1161
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,490
Kyu Han, you sound really down.

1162
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:06,690
That's because he feels guilty.

1163
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:09,130
- Why would he feel guilty? - He's sorry about the orchard.

1164
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:10,860
Maybe he won’t be here next week.

1165
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:13,860
We should hold him responsible for it. Taeyang.

1166
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:16,970
Why did you suggest it when you're not good at peeling an apple?

1167
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:19,540
(Why did you suggest it when you're not good at peeling an apple?)

1168
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,240
(He shifts responsibility onto Taeyang all of a sudden.)

1169
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,640
The whole thing happened because Taeyang said he's good at it.

1170
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,880
Should I apologize?

1171
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,010
(He's witty.)

1172
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:31,780
You should definitely apologize for this.

1173
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,880
(We all apologize again.)

1174
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,720
- All right. - Let's move on to Heung Kook.

1175
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,990
- Heung Kook. - Meme.

1176
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:39,390
Heung Kook's 17 years old.

1177
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:43,290
- Hang on. - What was that?

1178
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,030
(Kim Heung Kook's legendary performances)

1179
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:48,530
What's that?

1180
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:49,730
That's it.

1181
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:52,270
He was very slim back then.

1182
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:53,270
I know.

1183
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,270
It was his best days.

1184
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:58,970
I was slim, and I had a good head of hair back then.

1185
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,340
(Staggering)

1186
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,610
There he goes!

1187
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,610
All the backup dancers lied down.

1188
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:09,520
(The point is the reeling steps.)

1189
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,850
- Look at that. - He's likely to fall down.

1190
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:13,760
- Have you fell dancing to the song? - Yes.

1191
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,790
He just fell.

1192
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:15,890
(He fell on the stage.)

1193
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:19,960
(It's the legendary dance which got him arthritis in his knee joints.)

1194
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,230
("Reggae Party" in 1994)

1195
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:24,000
It's "Reggae Party".

1196
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:30,140
(It's a reggae song which has Heung Kook's freewheeling style.)

1197
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:34,980
(I'm feeling confident)

1198
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,210
(Giggling)

1199
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:39,780
(The highlight of this song is this exclamation.)

1200
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:41,980
What's that?

1201
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:43,890
("Shaking" in 1992)

1202
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:45,220
It's "Shaking".

1203
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,260
Is this "Gag Concert"?

1204
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:48,690
Is he a comedian?

1205
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:49,790
(He dances like a primitive man.)

1206
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,330
This song was quite popular.

1207
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:53,730
Right. It's "Shaking".

1208
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,070
(Heung Kook's PR point is his freewheeling musical style.)

1209
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:59,940
It's something people still can't even try.

1210
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,970
How did you come up with the dance moves? I'm so curious.

1211
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:06,440
I was in a vocal group.

1212
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,610
I was an obscure singer for about 10 years.

1213
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:12,180
Then I released the single, "Tiger Swallowtail".

1214
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,050
I got a call from a TV show for the first time ...

1215
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:16,450
- with that song. - I see.

1216
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:18,890
So I had a rehearsal there in the afternoon.

1217
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:21,860
There were no choir or backup dancers for me.

1218
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,430
They wanted me to sing alone.

1219
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:26,500
- While others got all those things. - I see.

1220
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,830
- So I got an idea. - You had a plan?

1221
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:32,640
I decided to dance like that during the shooting.

1222
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,840
Tiger Swallowtail, fly

1223
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,410
When the part began,

1224
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:39,810
I thought I had to do something about flying.

1225
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:41,410
So you were describing a butterfly?

1226
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:42,480
That's right.

1227
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,550
- Was it a butterfly? - Yes.

1228
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:46,850
- A butterfly? - A butterfly coming out of a pupa.

1229
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:48,480
From a larva...

1230
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,220
- The metamorphosis of a butterfly? - That's right.

1231
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,220
(The metamorphosis?)

1232
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,820
The metamorphosis?

1233
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,360
The metamorphosis of a butterfly.

1234
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,890
It doesn't mean I'm a pervert.

1235
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:58,790
From a larva to a butterfly.

1236
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:00,300
That's right.

1237
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,830
It's called metamorphosis.

1238
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,170
Really?

1239
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:05,570
(He didn't know the word.)

1240
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:09,710
Have you injured or sprained your ankles dancing to the song?

1241
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:12,780
I got a lot of calls from oriental medical clinics.

1242
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:16,250
They said I could visit their clinic if I had any problem.

1243
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,010
A lot of people fell and got injured...

1244
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:21,980
imitating my dance moves back then.

1245
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,050
- Right. - Imitating your dance moves?

1246
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:25,290
- Yes, while they were imitating me. - You were very popular back then.

1247
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:26,360
He's right.

1248
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,960
Who do you think was more popular? Heung Kook of the time or Taeyang?

1249
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,730
- Of course it's Taeyang. - Taeyang?

1250
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:34,330
- He's BigBang. - Compared to you of that time?

1251
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:36,670
Back then, to be honest with you,

1252
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:39,140
I had no rival.

1253
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:42,510
Of course there were many popular dance singers...

1254
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:45,270
like Sobangcha, Park Nam Jung, or Kim Wan sun.

1255
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:47,180
But "Tiger Swallowtail" overpowered them.

1256
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,480
- It turned the game around. - I heard...

1257
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,780
you settled all your debts with this song.

1258
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:55,450
- It was a big hit. - In fact,

1259
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:57,490
my parents are all dead.

1260
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:01,020
Before they died, my family was very poor.

1261
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:04,590
But only with the song, "Tiger Swallowtail",

1262
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:09,070
I paid off all my mother's debts.

1263
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:11,400
She was very happy about it.

1264
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:15,870
The song, "Tiger Swallowtail" completely changed a person's life.

1265
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:19,640
Then I believe you have...

1266
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,680
all the detailed knowledge about tiger swallowtail.

1267
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,250
Can you tell us about a tiger swallowtail then?

1268
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:27,150
There are various kinds of butterflies.

1269
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,720
(He answers immediately.)

1270
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,820
But a swallowtail is the best.

1271
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:33,490
- Is it the best? - It's the best butterfly.

1272
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:36,160
I still see swallowtails when I go to the mountains and fields.

1273
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,660
- You see swallowtails? - Other people can't recognize it.

1274
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:40,100
But the butterflies recognize me.

1275
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:43,330
- The butterflies recognize you? - Are you sure they recognize you?

1276
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:46,300
He's the most popular singer in the butterfly's world.

1277
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,300
(He's the most popular singer with butterflies.)

1278
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:50,540
When I go to the mountains and fields,

1279
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:52,610
others can't see them. But I...

1280
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:54,110
- Look at him. - Taeyang.

1281
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:55,540
I've never lied in my life.

1282
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:58,110
- He looks so serious. - Other butterflies don't do that?

1283
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:00,550
Cabbage butterflies and sulfur butterflies just fly past by me.

1284
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,650
- They fly past by you? - They don't like you.

1285
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:05,090
But tiger swallowtails come to me to say hello.

1286
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:07,490
(What a coincidence!)

1287
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:10,560
- Are you serious? - It's unbelievable.

1288
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,200
You should go to the mountains and fields with me.

1289
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,630
To the mountains and fields?

1290
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:17,230
- To see the truth? - He's like a poet.

1291
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,340
I can't help it wonder...

1292
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:22,540
how Taeyang liked the Tiger Swallowtail dance.

1293
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:25,610
I watched the performance when I was very young.

1294
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:27,880
I seriously think that...

1295
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,280
it was a revolutionary performance.

1296
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,950
It was very cool.

1297
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:36,820
I think the song is sophisticated enough to be released now.

1298
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:39,920
(BigBang always show flashy performances.)

1299
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:45,360
(Taeyang is an outstanding artist.)

1300
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,870
(One thing they have in common is that they show shocking performances.)

1301
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:54,970
He's right. So I thought about this meme.

1302
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:57,310
I was thinking it'd be great if Taeyang danced to the song.

1303
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:58,710
- To "Tiger Swallowtail"? - "Tiger Swallowtail".

1304
00:51:58,710 --> 00:51:59,780
- It's a good idea. - What do you think?

1305
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,680
- It must be cool. - Can I sing the song?

1306
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,150
(He politely asks it.)

1307
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:05,150
- That'd be great. - Did you see that?

1308
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:06,420
What?

1309
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,780
Can I sing the song?

1310
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,980
He's so cool.

1311
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,450
He's amazing.

1312
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:12,920
- This is the best meme. - It's something...

1313
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,360
we can never see from Jae Hoon.

1314
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,090
- What did I do? - It's...

1315
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:20,060
Is it something you can't see from me?

1316
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:22,830
I've never seen him being so polite.

1317
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:26,370
I think Sang Min is a smooth talker.

1318
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:27,400
(He's a smooth talker.)

1319
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,970
- He's good. - It's discrimination.

1320
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:33,780
Let's watch him sing "Tiger Swallowtail". Here's the microphone.

1321
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:34,840
(He wants to be the Variety Cheat Code like Heung Kook.)

1322
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,810
(Nervous)

1323
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:39,380
- It must be cool. - I'm so excited.

1324
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:40,650
It'll be a big hit.

1325
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:42,220
The song would top the chart again.

00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,930
(He gets into a groove.)

1330
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:55,300
This is exciting.

1331
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:58,070
He's just like Heung Kook.

1332
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:00,140
Yes! There it goes.

1333
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,670
This is amazing.

1334
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:07,280

That's it!

1337
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:11,610
(Taeyang adds a cooler style to it.)

1338
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,980
- Look. - It's so much cooler.

1339
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,920
Nice!

1340

(Good!)

1342
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:28,030
(The two with similar lives sing together.)

1343
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:29,470
- Yes. - This is nice.

1344
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,300
(A tasty song with a cooler style)

1345

1347

- It sounds trendy. - I know.

1348
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:43,050
That's Taeyang's song!

1349
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,610
Taeyang swallowtail.

1350
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,120
(How upsetting is this?)

1351
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,850
Please don't be upset.

1352

(I'm upset)

1353

(He's dizzy.)

1360

(Butterflies are everywhere in the basement.)

1361
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:17,850
(Taeyang wants to party.)

1362
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:21,650

("Taeyang Swallowtail" rewrote history.)

1366
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:33,330
That was perfect.

1367
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,930
- That was amazing. - It truly was.

1368
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:38,200
- I love "Taeyang Swallowtail". - Me too.

(Taeyang knows how to party.)

1370
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:44,140
Since Taeyang sang "Tiger Swallowtail" today,

1371
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:46,080
the digital sales will go up.

1372
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,280
- You're right. - I know.

1373
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,180
It'll roam up the charts.

1374
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:50,750
Why don't you sing...

1375
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:52,850
"Tiger Swallowtail's Eyes, Nose, Lips"?

1376
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:54,550
(They find it absurd.)

1377

You don't have to if you don't want to.

1378

(What?)

1379
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:01,320
So let's go back to Heung Kook.

1380
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,260
While we were watching his memes, we saw...

1381
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,030
- "I'm feeling confident". - Right.

1382
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,730
(In 1994, "Reggae Party" brought on the reggae craze.)

1383
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:12,200
Those who did reggae music called him...

1384
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,870
the King of Reggae.

1385
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:15,940
I heard that "Reggae Party"...

1386
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:18,740
was written after witnessing...

1387
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,680
the success of Kim Gun Mo's "Excuse".

1388
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:22,880
I don't do things I need to make excuses for.

1389
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,850
(His puns catches the comedian off guard.)

1390
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:26,750
- Taeyang likes it. - That was unexpected.

1391
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,620
- Look at Taeyang. - You can respond to anything.

1392
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:32,490
You're actually making our jobs harder here.

1393
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:33,720
Do you know that?

1394
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:35,860
That's how it is for some.

1395
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,160
(So what?)

1396
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,530
He's completely trouble-free.

1397
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:41,530
It's as if he doesn't care at all.

1398
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:44,500
Did you know that Sang Min...

1399
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,840
worked with me on "Reggae Party"?

1400
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,310
Did you rap for him?

1401
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:51,710
Yes, I rapped in the song.

1402
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:53,210
Could we hear it live?

1403
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:55,080
- Do you remember the lyrics? - Well...

1404
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,780
I only sang it when we recorded the song.

1405
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:58,980
- I see. - Really?

1406
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,580
Have you performed it together before?

1407
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:02,820
- No. - This'll be the first time.

1408
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:04,790
This would instantly be a meme.

1409
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:05,890
This I should do.

1410
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:07,660
I think that this'll be legendary.

1411
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:09,090
(Will a legendary meme be born?)

1412
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,460
(It's been 23 years...)

1413
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,760
(since they brought us the Jamaican rhythm.)

1414
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:16,100
(How will they look on stage?)

1415
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:18,800
(Startled)

1416
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,000
Looks perfect.

1417
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,840
(They're wearing appropriate outfits.)

1418
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,210
This is nice.

1419
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:25,710
They look more like Pakistani men.

1420
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:28,010
(This is what Heung Kook wore for his album cover.)

1421
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:30,880
- We can't make a mistake. - The hats look like...

1422
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,980
the candy baskets at the cashier counter...

1423
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:36,020
of a barbecue restaurant.

1424
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:37,150
(They involuntarily look sweet too.)

1425
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:39,460
(Music starts.)

1426

("Reggae Party" by Kim Heung Kook)

1427
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,760
(With Chief Director Lee)

1428
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:49,830
(Please welcome the band from Jamaica.)

1429

(Yes!)

1435
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,850
(Now it's time for the hook.)

1436
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,420
(His other selves are invited to the party too.)

1437
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:13,090
(Look at that.)

1438
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,590
(Their presence makes him more confident.)

1439
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:18,990
(Witness his confidence!)

1440
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:22,400
(He ends the first verse with his unique laugh.)

1441
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,800
He'll now rap.

1442
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:25,740
(He's off beat.)

1443
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,740
(The way you look for behind)

1444
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,040
(Swagger)

1445
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,170
Lee Sang Min!

1446
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:33,340
(Don't wake me up if this is a dream)

1447
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:36,110
(I can't take how thrilling this is)

1448
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:39,650
(The Jamaican rhythm fills the basement.)

1449
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,420
(I'm feeling confident, I'm feeling confident)

1450
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,790
(Tongue rolling)

1451
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,360
(That'll even shake Bob Marley's confidence.)

1452
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:53,300
(The reggae brothers were a success.)

1453
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,700
That was awesome.

1454
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:59,870
No wonder Heung Kook is known as a legend.

1455
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:01,100
He's so cool.

1456
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:04,070
Now that we've seen Heung Kook's,

1457
00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:06,780
- it's now time to see Taeyang's. - That's right.

1458
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,310
Could you look more adorable this time?

1459
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:09,780
Sure, I'll try.

1460
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,850
What's my meme?

1461
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:13,280
(Adorable)

1462
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,790
(Look at Taeyang party.)

1463
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:18,590
(Here is Taeyang after his concert in the US.)

1464
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:20,760
- Is he in the US? - Yes.

1465
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:22,590
It's after his concert.

1466
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:24,160
Is that his bodyguard?

1467
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:26,830
- Did this happen in the US? - Was it with an American?

1468
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,130
Where on earth is he?

1469
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,670
It's where he had his concert in the US.

1470
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:32,130
Is he behind the stage?

1471
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:33,840
I think it's the parking lot.

1472
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,840
(Taeyang can't hide his excitement.)

1473
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,740
You really must like to party.

1474
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,180
Are you sure that this wasn't a fight?

1475
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:43,550
(They look cool even when saying goodbye.)

1476
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:47,420
(Sistar won 1st place on a TV music show.)

1477
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,650
(BigBang seems three times happier.)

1478
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:52,690
You're happier than Sistar is.

1479
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:56,930
(Taeyang seems to be the most excited.)

1480
00:58:56,930 --> 00:58:59,760
This is during Sistar's acceptance speech.

1481
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,800
(He's embarrassed.)

1482
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,370
Please tell me that I saw wrong.

1483
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:05,900
(During the ending scene...)

1484
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,640
We'll see someone jump. See?

1485
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,170
Some flew past the screen again.

1486
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:13,740
Were you drunk that day?

1487
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:15,410
- Of course not. - I think he was.

1488
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:17,280
Did you have wine?

1489
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:19,150
That's a live show.

1490
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:21,620
I do admit that I wasn't myself that day.

1491
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,020
- Do you admit it? - Yes.

1492
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,220
There are times when I can't help myself...

1493
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:28,490
when I feel the urge to party.

1494
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:30,130
Why were you so happy that day?

1495
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:32,360
As you all saw, we didn't win first place.

1496
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,660
I know. We all saw that.

1497
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:38,000
We had released an album after a long hiatus.

1498
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,670
- That's why you were happy. - That day,

1499
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:42,410
I felt like nothing could go wrong.

1500
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:43,610
- Everything was a joy. - That's right.

1501
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:45,940
Did Sistar say something to you that day?

1502
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:48,140
They never said anything to us,

1503
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:49,950
but I'm still sorry about it.

1504
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:52,750
It wasn't us who won first place,

1505
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,620
but I acted like...

1506
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:55,820
- a crazy guy. - Like you had won.

1507
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:58,390
You're being too kind about this.

1508
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:00,490
It doesn't matter who's the senior artist.

1509
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:02,120
You were helping them in a way.

1510
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,290
You were happy that they had...

1511
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:05,830
- won first place. - Exactly.

1512
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:08,030
- Junior artists were behind you. - That's right.

1513
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:09,500
Did you see their expressions?

1514
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:12,700
(What's wrong with him?)

1515
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,940
(IU and Koo Ha Ra)

1516
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:18,440
I could read that on their faces.

1517
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:21,780
So why did you dance with the bodyguard off stage?

1518
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:25,080
That happened after we successfully...

1519
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,920
wrapped up our concert.

1520
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,780
A security guard...

1521
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:31,990
who saw me dance on stage asked if we could dance together.

1522
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:33,160
Really?

1523
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,960
- He's a skilled dancer too. - I know.

1524
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,190
- Really? - He was talented.

1525
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:37,730
Who won the dance-off?

1526
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:38,730
(Flustered)

1527
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:39,960
- Who won? - Was it you?

1528
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,830
- It's important. - We need to know.

1529
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:44,270
I'm sure he felt a certain way afterwards.

1530
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:46,640
- He knows who won. - Right.

1531
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,840
As you saw on the video,

1532
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,640
I was the better dancer.

1533
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,910
Of course.

1534
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:54,610
- That's right. - I agree.

1535
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:57,810
The reason you came to us today...

1536
01:00:57,810 --> 01:01:00,080
is because you're not funny enough.

1537
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,490
You wanted us to bring that side out of you.

1538
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:05,720
So to know how you really are,

1539
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,320
we'll see a video of someone close to you.

1540
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,930
We asked a few questions.

1541
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:12,930
Let's see how your close friends see you.

1542
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:14,100
I'm dying to know.

1543
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:16,300
(Under the Microscope)

1544
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:18,400
Taeyang has never been drunk before.

1545
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,400
What is he like after a few drinks though?

1546
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:22,970
- It's not pretty. - What?

1547
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,540
I've seen him drunk many times.

1548
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:26,580
That's his habit.

1549
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:27,780
(He always says that he isn't drunk.)

1550
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:30,910
Taeyang claims that he's funny in person.

1551
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:32,280
What's your opinion on that?

1552
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,780
That's what he says when he's drunk.

1553
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:36,590
- Really? - He's not funny at all.

1554
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:38,590
It's proof that he's drunk.

1555
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:40,860
Who are you to Taeyang?

1556
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:45,330
- Do you know who it is? - He doesn't have many friends.

1557
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,030
I'm like his only friend.

1558
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:50,700
- Who can it be? - I think I know who.

1559
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:53,100
It's G-Dragon!

1560
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:56,140
(Surprised)

1561
01:01:57,470 --> 01:02:00,210
Is there anything you'd like to say to him?

1562
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,150
(Taeyang looks forward to it.)

1563
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:07,350
I'd like to point out that my single was released too.

1564
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:09,550
- He's talking about his own song. - Anyway,

1565
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:13,790
he's like an older brother even though we're the same age.

1566
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:17,730
I could tell that he was stressed out...

1567
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:19,860
with this new album of his.

1568
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:23,130
As his friend, I'm glad...

1569
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:26,400
that he was satisfied with it at the end.

1570
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,040
I wish him nothing but the best.

1571
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,210
Think of Make me Viral on Monday,

1572
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:35,440
and think of me on the other days of the week.

1573
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,380
We must've forced him to say that.

1574
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,250
I'm sure it was on a script.

1575
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:41,480
He probably didn't want to say that.

1576
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,790
Think of me on the other days of the week.

1577
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:45,420
(He tries not to smile.)

1578
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,320
Then think of Taeyang on Sunday.

1579
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:51,730
- G-Dragon. - He delivered that in style.

1580
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:53,800
He was threatened into saying that.

1581
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,500
"Think of Make me Viral on Monday."

1582
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,170
So you have many drinking habits.

1583
01:02:57,170 --> 01:03:01,670
G-Dragon's currently on a world tour.

1584
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:04,540
I guess he's exhausted. During the interview...

1585
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:06,980
seeing how he said they were just drinking habits.

1586
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:09,310
As I mentioned earlier,

1587
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:11,750
he always just smiles and says that he lost.

1588
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:15,450
Now, he will think that I'm boring.

1589
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:18,620
Then which one of you is funnier? You or G-Dragon?

1590
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:19,790
Then who is funnier? You or G-Dragon?

1591
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:21,790
I believe I'm funnier.

1592
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,230
He takes pride in being funny.

1593
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:25,660
He does. He definitely does.

1594
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:27,130
Do you really not have any friends?

1595
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:29,000
I...

1596
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,970
Well, I like staying at home.

1597
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:35,570
I don't go out often to meet my friends.

1598
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:38,210
People whom I can call my friends are the members of my group.

1599
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:40,880
When I was young, I had more friends.

1600
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,650
After I started my career in the entertainment business,

1601
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:45,080
- You didn't have time to meet up. - I didn't have time to meet them.

1602
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,180
- Even if you called, you can't see. - When we meet,

1603
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:49,720
- we don't understand each other. - You are different.

1604
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:52,050
- My members are my closest fiends. - I can see that.

1605
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:54,420
Shouldn't there be people from Mars or Venus...

1606
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:56,890
among your friends, Taeyang?

1607
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:58,390
(He can't believe what he just heard.)

1608
01:03:58,390 --> 01:04:00,100
- Shouldn't this be a problem? - Goodness.

1609
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,730
- Chief Director. - You can't act like him.

1610
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:03,630
(He's taking after someone.)

1611
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:04,900
You can't be like this.

1612
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,440
G-Dragon said that in the video that you are...

1613
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,310
like an older brother.

1614
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:13,110
Then what about you? What kind of a friend is G-Dragon?

1615
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:14,340
To me,

1616
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,480
he can't be a kind of friend I have.

1617
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,920
- He's the only friend. - The only friend?

1618
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,050
Yes, we met at the age of 13.

1619
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:23,720
- When you were 13? - Until now,

1620
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:26,120
I spent more than half of my life with him.

1621
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:29,790
- Do you plan to live with him? - Of course.

1622
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:31,530
- Wait, what? Live together? - Yes.

1623
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:33,800
I can't see that far out.

1624
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,430
- He's living with his parents now. - Really?

1625
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:37,730
You can go to his house and live together.

1626
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:39,140
- Me? - That'd be funny.

1627
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:41,000
Taeyang has his own parents.

1628
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,610
(Stop it.)

1629
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,940
From my observation,

1630
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:48,080
I can see that Taeyang is a good dancer and singer.

1631
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,210
He's perfect, but among his talents,

1632
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:53,680
I think he's the best when it comes to having fun.

1633
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,990
I also uploaded the dance cover...

1634
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:58,990
of Blackpink's "As If It's Your Last" on my social media account.

1635
01:04:58,990 --> 01:04:59,990
Why did you do that?

1636
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:01,920
I posted it because I was bored.

1637
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,060
There were a lot for me to memorize. I wanted someone to take a look.

1638
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:07,560
But my video got more than 480,000 hits.

1639
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,300
So I think if Taeyang dances to the song,

1640
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:11,770
- I wonder if people will watch it. - He'll get a few millions easy.

1641
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:14,400
Exactly. This will gain a lot of attention from the public.

1642
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,040
- Gook Ju. - Isn't this for your personal gain?

1643
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,770
After hearing that he doesn't have any friends,

1644
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:19,480
I think you're trying to be his friend rather quickly.

1645
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:22,010
- I can do both. - If you try to dance with him...

1646
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:25,250
Then Gook Ju, why don't you dance here?

1647
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:26,980
And Taeyang can look at her dance and copy her.

1648
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:29,550
I think Gook Ju can be his dance instructor and dance in the front.

1649
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:32,050
(Gook Ju's dance lesson)

1650
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:34,890
Turn your arms and lift them up. Do it like this.

1651
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:36,730
I never imagined Taeyang would learn dance moves from you.

1652
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:39,160
- Me neither. I'm so nervous. - No one imagined this before.

1653
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,630
- I don't know if I should teach. - You'll memorize this right away?

1654
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:43,800
- You can just feel the song. - Sure.

1655
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:45,530
I think she's teaching him the wrong moves.

1656
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,210
- How is this? - I don't want to hear her sing.

1657
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:51,710
Let's see now. This is good enough.

1658
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,080
("As If It's Your Last" by Blackpink)

1659
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:56,480
(With Gook Ju's gestures,)

1660
01:05:57,150 --> 01:05:59,320
(Taeyang's journey to dance female idol group's choreography begins.)

1661
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,420
(Dancing)

1662
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:04,220
(Since it's his first time, he looks a bit sloppy.)

1663
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:06,090
(However)

1664
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,260
(Getting the hang of it)

1665
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:09,630
He catches on quickly.

1666
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:11,590
(The beginner catches up to her quite quickly.)

1667
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:13,960
(Fancy)

1668
01:06:14,830 --> 01:06:16,730
(He even shows some freestyle dance moves.)

1669
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:17,770
(1, 2.)

1670
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,970
(He's a dance prodigy.)

1671
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:21,570
We'll do this move now.

1672
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:25,540
(He delivers perfect dance moves which is hard to believe.)

1673
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:27,880
(Their moves are in synch.)

1674
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:33,020
(It's her last dancing lesson that will never happen again in the future.)

1675
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:36,320
- He learned them so quickly. - He's so good.

1676
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,850
- He does. - When I watched, he danced well.

1677
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:41,060
- I agree. - Gook Ju taught him well.

1678
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:42,960
- Really? Was that good? - We should...

1679
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,190
- listen to his opinion. - That's right.

1680
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:47,700
- Taeyang is too nice. - That's true.

1681
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:50,670
What's the biggest rebellion you ever had?

1682
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:53,200
This is so sudden.

1683
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,400
- There's none. - I bet.

1684
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,810
I think he rebels...

1685
01:06:56,810 --> 01:06:59,940
- through having various hairstyles. - It's true.

1686
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:01,810
They are all unique.

1687
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:05,310
(The transition of Taeyang's hairstyles)

1688
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:07,980
- Mohican. - He did many different hairstyles.

1689
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:10,950
Since he always has a unique hairstyle,

1690
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:13,620
his current hairstyle looks normal.

1691
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:15,760
- It is an ordinary hairstyle. - I like his hair though.

1692
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,460
I like it too.

1693
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:19,930
I realized after some time had passed.

1694
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:21,760
- What did you realize? - A lot of people didn't like...

1695
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,070
those hairstyles.

1696
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:24,770
I learned that especially the ladies weren't fond of them.

1697
01:07:24,770 --> 01:07:25,940
Of course they aren't.

1698
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:27,540
I found that out now.

1699
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,140
You should do it together.

1700
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:31,740
Is there something that inspires you to have those hairstyles?

1701
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:33,740
When I watched National Geographic...

1702
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:35,140
and channels like this,

1703
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:38,880
I thought that I'd look cool after seeing some animals.

1704
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,620
That makes sense. One time, your hair looked like a scorpion.

1705
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:42,820
It did.

1706
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:46,360
You had a hairstyle that resembled the mane of a lion.

1707
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,760
- It catches people's eyes. - What's the one on the end?

1708
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,490
- What is it? - It's a buffalo.

1709
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:52,560
Did you get that hair done with your own hair?

1710
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,330
Inside my hair,

1711
01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:56,270
- they put hair rolls. - They used hair rolls.

1712
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:57,530
After I got my hair done for that,

1713
01:07:57,530 --> 01:07:59,700
- I thought it was revolutionary. - You thought it was amazing.

1714
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:00,900
- Really? - Yes.

1715
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,540
I thought no one ever had a hairstyle like mine.

1716
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,210
So I got that hairstyle.

1717
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:07,080
After my music video was released,

1718
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,010
my fans photoshopped a roll of gimbap in it.

1719
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:11,080
That did happen. I saw it.

1720
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,520
I thought I should keep the hairstyle.

1721
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:14,150
So I couldn't perform with that hairstyle.

1722
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:15,680
- It appeared only in the video? - Yes, only in the music video.

1723
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,520
It just looked like you put a pair of telescope on top of you.

1724
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:21,560
- He put it there after using it? - He can place it there for a while.

1725
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,060
The person behind him can do this without realizing it.

1726
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:25,260
(Let me see.)

1727
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:27,800
Just like Mount Nam.

1728
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,070
(They demonstrate perfect teamwork when they tease people.)

1729
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:33,170
I know that you are preparing to go on tours all around the world.

1730
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:36,410
Can I ask you to show us a sampler of your concert?

1731
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:39,140
You have a competent friend.

1732
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:40,740
This is the most practical one.

1733
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:42,710
Team One got a promising employee.

1734
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:45,210
- Could you do it for me? - Of course.

1735
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:47,150
(Taeyang never says no.)

1736
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:49,220
I think he does everything he's asked of.

1737
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:51,090
You can't see this anywhere.

1738
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:52,520
Can you lend me money?

1739
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,020
- How much do you need? - "How much"?

1740
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:55,120
"How much"?

1741
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,090
I can't ask him for favors because he never says no.

1742
01:08:57,090 --> 01:08:58,460
- He'll do everything. - Exactly.

1743
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:01,000
Jae Hoon, if you're close to someone, don't get money involved.

1744
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,060
(Looking serious)

1745
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:05,270
Heung Kook, did I really borrow money from him?

1746
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:07,400
I got a feeling that you might.

1747
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:09,770
(Feeling guilty)

1748
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:14,240
(PR Video by Eun Hyuk)

1749
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:17,010
- This is the world tour. - They'll join in the middle?

1750
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:19,550
(They are his back-up dancers.)

1751
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:20,580
- They look so cool. - Hold up.

1752
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:22,120
We're filming here. Get out of here.

1753
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:23,720
(They go along with him.)

1754
01:09:24,090 --> 01:09:25,350
(They are funnier than me.)

1755
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:27,320
Let's go.

01:09:28,090 --> 01:09:30,290
("Ringa Linga" by Taeyang)

1757
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:33,230
(He's the best vocalist who has a world tour to attend to.)

1758
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:37,400
(The performance of a world-class singer)

1759
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:39,770
(The performance is about to unfold in the basement.)

1760
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:43,310
(Raise your hands as if you're liberated)

1761
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:46,710
(Jump like you have a sprained ankle)

1762
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:48,910
(He starts rapping first.)

1763
01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:52,580
(His intense rapping...)

1764
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:53,980
(is as good as his singing skill.)

1765
01:09:54,850 --> 01:09:56,950
(A good dancing skill is a bonus.)

1766
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:00,720
(And)

1767
01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:03,560
(Taeyang is known for his impressive voice.)

1768
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:10,100
(His rapping, dancing, and singing are all perfect.)

1769
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:14,440
(I'm Taeyang.)

1770
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:24,380
(The whole country is pumped up by his song.)

1771
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:27,420
(His song also awakens their inner instinct to dance.)

1772
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:28,680
Sing it now.

1773
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,850
(Everyone, sing it together.)

1774
01:10:34,490 --> 01:10:35,620
Sweet!

1775
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:37,690
Gosh, that's so cool.

1776
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,460
("Ringa" is an irresistible magic spell.)

1777
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:43,770
(And)

1778
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:47,640
(For the excitement they couldn't unleash,)

1779
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:51,370
(he starts counting again.)

1780
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:55,380
(This is Taeyang's ritual calling for people's excitement.)

1781
01:10:56,050 --> 01:11:00,480
(Everyone, wake up to have fun.)

1782
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:03,250
(His ritual is over.)

1783
01:11:04,590 --> 01:11:06,490
(Pump up the volume now.)

1784
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:08,690
(Here we go.)

1785
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:15,230
(Let's sing it one more time.)

1786
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,300
(Thanks to Taeyang's unyielding magic spell...)

1787
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:24,840
(Everyone learned how to have fun.)

1788
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:27,740
(You'd better do something about my heart.)

1789
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:32,520
- I went crazy. - That was awesome.

1790
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,280
What moved me was that during the song,

1791
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,450
his dancers came here and drummed the desk.

1792
01:11:37,450 --> 01:11:41,020
I thought that his concerts had to be successful.

1793
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:44,160
(It was when the song was reaching its climax.)

1794
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:47,000
(This is nice.)

1795
01:11:49,870 --> 01:11:51,830
Let's give a round of applause for him.

1796
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:53,970
- Thank you. - Thank you so much.

1797
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:56,540
We saw numerous PR videos today.

1798
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:57,640
Right.

1799
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,980
Both of you can choose the video...

1800
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:02,510
that you liked the most.

1801
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:05,110
I think today, "Taeyang Swallowtail" has to be the winner.

1802
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:06,220
That's your choice, Taeyang?

1803
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:08,750
Taeyang chose "Taeyang Swallowtail".

1804
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:10,250
I think even when we wrap up,

1805
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:13,190
I'd like to finish the shooting while we sing "Taeyang Swallowtail".

1806
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:14,260
Goodness!

1807
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:15,260
(Really?)

1808
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:16,930
He's such a nice colleague.

1809
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:18,160
- I mean it. - He's so cool.

1810
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:22,060
In my opinion, it'd be better if you chose "Taeyang Swallowtail".

1811
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:23,270
- It must be "Taeyang Swallowtail". - Exactly.

1812
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:25,200
Today, we will go with only "Taeyang Swallowtail".

1813
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,700
- We'll sing "Taeyang Swallowtail". - They both chose that.

1814
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:30,040
We'll finish up as we sing the song.

1815
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:31,510
- Let's wrap up. - It's "Taeyang Swallowtail".

1816
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:33,180
I think "Taeyang Swallowtail" might be popular.

1817
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:34,940
This might climb up the chart.

1818
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:36,380
Director.

1819
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:38,350
(They finish off the excitement with the song.)

1820
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:39,980
You should sing it together.

1821
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:42,490
(Because it's an encore, the prelude sounds even more exciting.)

1822
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:44,020
(Holding his breath)

1823
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:46,120
(Tiger swallowtail)

1824
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:48,920
(As Heung Kook sings a measure,)

1825
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,460
(these tiger swallowtails are gathering around him.)

1826
01:12:51,190 --> 01:12:52,530
(On the flowerbed)

1827
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:53,530
(Sang Min joins them.)

1828
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:54,860
(Chief Director Lee can sing.)

1829
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,630
Here comes Taeyang!

1830
01:12:57,630 --> 01:12:58,900
(Showing off a technique)

1831
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,400
(Get ready,)

1832
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:02,670
(and fly.)

1833
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:06,210
("Taeyang Swallowtail" is about to soar successfully again.)

1834
01:13:07,010 --> 01:13:08,340
Let's hide.

1835
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:09,350
(Hiding)

1836
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:11,780
(Feeling great)

1837
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:15,020
- Awesome. - Tiger swallowtail.

1838
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:16,950
Just get at it!

1839
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:19,990
Hi. It's me, Taeyang.

1840
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,220
I had such a great time.

1841
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:25,330
Anyway, you should go to bed.

1842
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:28,060
Sleep tight. Good night.

1843
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:32,000
(Wanna One, an idol group loved by the nation will be on the show.)

1844
01:13:33,170 --> 01:13:34,600
(A variety show hazing to show off their charms)

1845
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:40,080
(I am the best at being funny on variety shows.)

1846
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:43,980
(Attracted to their tough and powerful sides)

1847
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:47,880
(Also attracted to the provocative words)

1848
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:51,020
(From the wake-up calls which are sweet to your ears...)

1849
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:53,290
(to the ones that make your eyes pop.)

1850
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:57,160
(They don't care about their images and give it all.)

1851
01:13:58,090 --> 01:14:01,360
(Wanna One is full of charms.)

1852
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:04,970
(Make me Viral)
