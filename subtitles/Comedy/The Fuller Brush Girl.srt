00:01:10,297 --> 00:01:12,299
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

3
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:14,342
Why?

4
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:16,136
It's time for Sunday brunch!

5
00:01:16,344 --> 00:01:19,556
Oh, come back
when it's time for Sunday dinner.

6
00:01:23,059 --> 00:01:25,687
But Mom made
her famous blueberry pancakes.

7
00:01:25,896 --> 00:01:30,567
And she used duck eggs for more nutrition
and a deeper flavor profile.

8
00:01:32,903 --> 00:01:35,113
What? I like my cooking shows.

9
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,908
- Come on!
- No, no, no.

10
00:01:37,992 --> 00:01:39,409
- Come on!
- No.

11
00:01:39,493 --> 00:01:40,786
Come on!

12
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:42,454
Here, Tommy.

13
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:46,583
Enjoy your breakfast bottle,
the most important bottle of the day.

14
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,716
- Morning, Mom.
- There he is!

15
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,179
My beautiful firstborn baby boy.

16
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:01,306
Have a seat right at the head of the table

17
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:03,809
and while you wait
for your favorite pancakes,

18
00:02:04,018 --> 00:02:06,770
enjoy a pre-breakfast milkshake.

19
00:02:08,856 --> 00:02:11,149
- You're being weird.
- I'm not being weird.

20
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:15,195
Can't a mom make her beautiful
firstborn son a pre-breakfast milkshake?

21
00:02:16,822 --> 00:02:18,198
Okay, that was kind of weird.

22
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:22,619
- Can I have some hot fudge on my pancakes?
- Sure, honey.

23
00:02:22,828 --> 00:02:24,329
Okay, you're up to something.

24
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,127
I got her up.
Aunt Stephanie is not a morning person.

25
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:37,676
No. No, Aunt Stephanie is a night person.

26
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:42,222
You know, when the clubs are going off,
bottles are popping,

27
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:43,557
people are hooking up...

28
00:02:46,393 --> 00:02:48,603
...their Xboxes.

29
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:53,191
- Aunt Steph, let's go get some juice.
- I don't want any juice.

30
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:57,237
Then help me pick out my juice.

31
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:01,199
She's such a good juice picker-outer.

32
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,208
I still haven't told the boys
Kimmy and Ramona are moving in today.

33
00:03:10,876 --> 00:03:12,127
Chicken.

34
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,798
- Okay, I'm a little chicken.
- No, I'm talking about the fried chicken.

35
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:21,887
The boys have been through so many changes
and now here comes another one,

36
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,431
and I just don't know
how they're going to react.

37
00:03:24,514 --> 00:03:29,019
So don't say a word until
I find the right moment to break the news.

38
00:03:29,103 --> 00:03:30,270
Sorry,

39
00:03:30,353 --> 00:03:31,563
I spilled the beans.

40
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,565
You told them?

41
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:36,777
No, I spilled the beans
when I was reaching for the chicken.

42
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:41,990
Mom, please don't make me do this.

43
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,201
Moving in with D.J. and those boys
is a terrible idea.

44
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,581
D.J. really needs us and you love her.
She's your godmother.

45
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,583
Really? I have a godmother?

46
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:55,545
So, like, three wishes?

47
00:03:56,421 --> 00:03:58,632
That's a fairy godmother.

48
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,844
Do you really want me to change schools
and be the outcast loner kid,

49
00:04:02,928 --> 00:04:05,764
all to move in
with the whitest family in America?

50
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:09,935
The Fullers are like albino polar bears

51
00:04:10,018 --> 00:04:12,312
drinking milk

52
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,230
in a snowstorm,

53
00:04:14,314 --> 00:04:16,775
watching <i>Frozen.</i>

54
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:20,070
That's pretty white.

55
00:04:32,582 --> 00:04:34,168
I am not going in there.

56
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,295
There is nothing you can do
to make me walk inside that house.

57
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,135
<i>Ramona?</i>

58
00:04:44,052 --> 00:04:46,805
That was so evil.

59
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:50,142
But extremely effective.

60
00:05:03,446 --> 00:05:05,573
Mom, just tell me what's going on.

61
00:05:05,657 --> 00:05:07,742
Um... Okay.

62
00:05:07,826 --> 00:05:10,996
You might think this is bad news,
but it really is good news,

63
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:14,249
just hiding in not-so-great news.

64
00:05:14,457 --> 00:05:17,878
It's like cauliflower
filled with jellybeans.

65
00:05:19,713 --> 00:05:22,049
Come on, Mom. How bad can it be?

66
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:25,177
I've waited my whole life to say this...

67
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,179
home, sweet home.

68
00:05:33,894 --> 00:05:34,895
No.

69
00:05:36,146 --> 00:05:37,313
Yes.

70
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:40,150
Come here, sister-wife.

71
00:05:44,196 --> 00:05:46,656
So, now you all know the good news.

72
00:05:46,865 --> 00:05:48,909
Kimmy and Ramona are here to help us out.

73
00:05:48,992 --> 00:05:51,245
And we really appreciate it,
don't we, boys?

74
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:55,331
Works for me. The more people
to drive me around, the merrier.

75
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:59,961
Jellybean-filled cauliflower my butt!

76
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,633
Ooh, the mouth on that kid!

77
00:06:07,552 --> 00:06:09,763
Oh, I feel at home already.

78
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:16,561
Oh, that's sweet.
You kept Ramona's turkey art?

79
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,521
No, that's mine.

80
00:06:20,523 --> 00:06:24,278
This is so cool.
I'm living in Jesse and Becky's old room.

81
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:26,446
I was never allowed up here before.

82
00:06:28,364 --> 00:06:31,201
I think Becky was always
a little jealous of me.

83
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,370
Yeah, that was definitely the reason.

84
00:06:35,914 --> 00:06:38,292
This will be the new
international headquarters

85
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:40,961
for Gibbler Style party planning.

86
00:06:41,628 --> 00:06:44,380
My Fathead will look great right here.

87
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,599
Gotta love it!

88
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,728
So where's my room?

89
00:06:58,812 --> 00:07:02,565
Oh, right through this door.
This is where Nicky and Alex used to live.

90
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:10,824
What do you think? Pretty cozy.

91
00:07:11,491 --> 00:07:13,743
Were Nicky and Alex hobbits?

92
00:07:16,246 --> 00:07:18,165
Maybe I should go live with Papa.

93
00:07:18,832 --> 00:07:22,961
You know your papa is always on the road,
so you're stuck with your mama.

94
00:07:23,837 --> 00:07:26,714
Or you can give me a nice apartment
and I can raise myself.

95
00:07:26,798 --> 00:07:29,884
Ramona, do your homework.
Ramona, clean your room.

96
00:07:30,093 --> 00:07:32,095
Ramona, listen to Ramona.

97
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:34,681
Wow, this mom thing is so easy.

98
00:07:35,974 --> 00:07:38,018
I got an idea from when I was a kid.

99
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:41,229
This might work out great
for Jackson and Max, and for you.

100
00:07:41,313 --> 00:07:44,149
What if I have the boys share a room,

101
00:07:44,232 --> 00:07:47,319
and you could have
your own bedroom downstairs?

102
00:07:47,402 --> 00:07:50,071
Private, big closet...

103
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,489
I'm listening.

104
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:53,992
That was it.

105
00:07:55,869 --> 00:07:57,954
Or stay up here with me.

106
00:07:58,163 --> 00:07:59,331
It will be so much fun.

107
00:07:59,414 --> 00:08:02,209
We'll have mother-daughter
slumber parties every night.

108
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:05,253
Let's go check out that other bedroom.

109
00:08:12,427 --> 00:08:14,304
Jackson, perfect timing.

110
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:17,849
I baked your favorite... chocolate cake.

111
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:19,517
Mom, Mom, Mom,

112
00:08:19,726 --> 00:08:23,688
if this is another bribe about Kimmy
and Ramona moving in, I'm cool.

113
00:08:23,897 --> 00:08:26,482
I can just go hide in my room.

114
00:08:28,735 --> 00:08:30,570
My boy cave.

115
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:33,448
About your boy cave,

116
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:35,992
there's something else I need to tell you.

117
00:08:36,076 --> 00:08:37,618
Well, it's really not bad news.

118
00:08:37,827 --> 00:08:39,537
I wouldn't say it's great news.

119
00:08:40,496 --> 00:08:42,457
I wouldn't say terrible.

120
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,334
I wouldn't say wonderful.

121
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,257
Jackson! Your room is under attack!
This is not a drill!

122
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:55,095
Really got to work
on getting to the point.

123
00:08:55,887 --> 00:08:57,013
My stuff!

124
00:08:57,097 --> 00:08:59,724
Excuse me.
I found some blue and white paint.

125
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:02,769
I want my room the same colors
as the flag of my people.

126
00:09:06,314 --> 00:09:08,858
You gave away my room?

127
00:09:09,609 --> 00:09:11,986
To give you a much bigger one.

128
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:15,949
In fact, it's so big,

129
00:09:16,032 --> 00:09:19,202
there's enough room for you and Max.

130
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:22,789
- Now I'm living with Max?
- I'm living with Jackson?

131
00:09:22,872 --> 00:09:26,418
This is the best day of my life!

132
00:09:30,588 --> 00:09:32,340
Okay, here's the game plan...

133
00:09:32,424 --> 00:09:34,550
Ramona is moving into Jackson's room,

134
00:09:34,634 --> 00:09:37,053
the baby is going into Max's old room,

135
00:09:37,262 --> 00:09:41,724
and the two of you are moving
across the hall into the...

136
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,311
good room.

137
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:48,398
Awesome! Give me a hug, roomie!

138
00:09:50,942 --> 00:09:52,444
Come on, Jackson.

139
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:54,946
This will be a really good thing
for you and Max.

140
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:59,033
- It will bring you closer together.
- How much closer can we be?

141
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,911
Let's find out in the good room.

142
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,585
Hey, that cake was for the boys.

143
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:11,421
Hm? Oh.

144
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:13,673
We know. We saved them each a slice.

145
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:16,050
Ooh.

146
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:20,388
I've got some bad news.

147
00:10:20,596 --> 00:10:22,849
Great, another cake!

148
00:10:24,434 --> 00:10:27,395
As if today weren't crazy enough,
my boss just called.

149
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:29,730
There's an emergency
down at the pet clinic.

150
00:10:29,814 --> 00:10:31,774
- I wish I didn't have to go...
- Fear not.

151
00:10:31,858 --> 00:10:35,653
This is exactly why Kimmy and I are here...
to make your life easier.

152
00:10:35,862 --> 00:10:39,282
- We are Team D.J.
- And Team D.J.'s got your back.

153
00:10:39,491 --> 00:10:43,537
Oh, thank you, guys, so much. I don't know
what I'd do if you weren't here.

154
00:10:44,162 --> 00:10:45,455
Team D.J. on three.

155
00:10:51,378 --> 00:10:53,547
- One, two...
- Well, hold on.

156
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:56,049
Is it one, two,
and then we say "Team D.J." on three?

157
00:10:56,132 --> 00:10:58,385
Or is it one, two, three,
and then we say it?

158
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:04,057
That would be going on four.
Nobody goes on four.

159
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:06,684
What am I, Canadian?

160
00:11:07,477 --> 00:11:09,270
I'm going to let Team D.J. work this out.

161
00:11:09,354 --> 00:11:11,272
I've been putting up with you
for 25 years.

162
00:11:11,356 --> 00:11:13,941
- You have put up with me?
- Why can't you do simple math?

163
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,152
It's moving day!

164
00:11:16,236 --> 00:11:19,322
I'm moving in with Jackson!
It's moving day!

165
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:22,617
I'm moving in with Jackson!

166
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:25,245
Ah, there's my favorite little brother.

167
00:11:25,328 --> 00:11:26,704
Oh, no offense, baldy.

168
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:30,250
You're a smart kid, right?

169
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,960
I've been told I'm very bright for my age.

170
00:11:34,504 --> 00:11:39,300
Well, then you understand
that you and me in the same room,

171
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:40,801
it's never going to work.

172
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,679
But Mom said living together
would bring us closer.

173
00:11:43,888 --> 00:11:45,640
Moms lie.

174
00:11:47,392 --> 00:11:50,645
Consider this...
in my room, I'm in charge of you,

175
00:11:50,853 --> 00:11:55,609
but in this room,
you are in charge of Tommy.

176
00:11:57,444 --> 00:12:00,447
- Don't you want to be The Man?
- Of course I do.

177
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,367
I've wanted to be The Man
ever since I was The Baby.

178
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:09,539
Well, then it's settled.
You're staying here. Knuckles.

179
00:12:15,295 --> 00:12:18,465
What is that nastiness?

180
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:24,095
- Um, uh, I don't smell a thing.
- It's Tommy's diaper!

181
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:29,183
No way am I living in this stinkatorium!

182
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:37,567
Thanks a lot, kid.
I was this close. This close.

183
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,161
I want my room back.

184
00:12:48,953 --> 00:12:54,875
Jaxito, moving here was my mom's idea,
not mine. So we're both victims.

185
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:58,546
I'm just the victim
with the private bedroom.

186
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,840
And have you seen the city view?

187
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:03,843
Uh, yeah. I used to live here.

188
00:13:08,306 --> 00:13:09,307
Oh, hey, Jackson.

189
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:12,686
Oh, hey, Aunt Steph.

190
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:16,856
Here's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

191
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:21,861
Imagine the thrill of sharing a room
with your adorable nephew, Max.

192
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,280
I'm imagining it, okay?

193
00:13:24,364 --> 00:13:27,450
Now you imagine me saying,
"No, thank you."

194
00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:30,953
Hey, now.

195
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,089
Hey. Aren't you driving down to LA
with your stuff?

196
00:13:42,173 --> 00:13:44,008
Isn't Becky waiting for you down there?

197
00:13:44,217 --> 00:13:46,761
Yeah, she is
but I forgot my lucky guitar, Priscilla.

198
00:13:46,844 --> 00:13:49,013
I left it here so I wouldn't forget it,
but forgot.

199
00:13:49,222 --> 00:13:51,725
I'm starting to think
this guitar is not so lucky.

200
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,435
Uncle Jesse, you've got to help me.

201
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:56,854
They want me to share a room
with a seven-year-old.

202
00:13:57,063 --> 00:13:59,482
I've got the fix.
You and Max, go hug it out.

203
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,819
We already did that.
I just got him off of me.

204
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:07,281
Well, you know, we used to hug it out
every day in the '80s.

205
00:14:08,616 --> 00:14:12,328
Sometimes it was so sweet,
you could hear violin music.

206
00:14:13,413 --> 00:14:15,707
- Uncle Jesse? I got this.
- You got chicken?

207
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,542
- We got chicken.
- You got this.

208
00:14:19,252 --> 00:14:22,338
Jackson, when I was five,
my dad forced me to move in with D.J.,

209
00:14:22,422 --> 00:14:24,591
and then he gave my bedroom
to Uncle Jesse.

210
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,052
But when I lived there it was
wall-to-wall with girly pink bunnies.

211
00:14:28,261 --> 00:14:30,846
You know, that could explain
my love for the theatre.

212
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:32,973
- Proceed.
- Thank you.

213
00:14:33,182 --> 00:14:37,311
Anyway, D.J. was furious so she moved down
to the garage. Of course, she got caught.

214
00:14:37,395 --> 00:14:40,690
If she wanted her own room, she should
have run away, rented an apartment.

215
00:14:41,357 --> 00:14:43,150
- Would that have worked?
- I doubt it.

216
00:14:43,234 --> 00:14:45,069
At age ten,
her credit score was really low.

217
00:14:49,574 --> 00:14:50,866
But it all turned out fine

218
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,161
because D.J. realized how lucky she was
to live with me.

219
00:14:54,245 --> 00:14:55,413
Do you get the lesson here?

220
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,918
You know what? I do. I'm going to go
upstairs right now and bond with Max.

221
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:04,213
Thanks, guys.

222
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:08,593
Steph, you know, for your first aunt talk,
I think you crushed it.

223
00:15:08,676 --> 00:15:10,219
- I did, didn't I?
- You'd better.

224
00:15:10,303 --> 00:15:14,056
I gave you, like, 1,000 uncle talks,
except you forgot two important words.

225
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,809
"Have mercy."

226
00:15:17,602 --> 00:15:19,562
No. "How rude."

227
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,442
All right, Jesse has left the building.

228
00:15:25,985 --> 00:15:27,945
But first, Jesse has to pee.

229
00:15:32,283 --> 00:15:36,203
Diaper changing is simple.
Just remove, refresh and replace.

230
00:15:36,412 --> 00:15:39,332
Then wait for Tommy to reload.

231
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:45,087
My friends are skiing in St. Moritz
right now, and I'm here changing diapers.

232
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,881
Selfie.

233
00:15:48,842 --> 00:15:50,510
They're going to be so jealous.

234
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,386
Okay, let's do this.

235
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:54,514
Wait. I'm not ready.

236
00:15:57,975 --> 00:16:00,019
Unleash the Kraken!

237
00:16:01,354 --> 00:16:03,481
All right. Here we go.

238
00:16:04,315 --> 00:16:07,026
You know, I haven't done this
since Michelle was a baby.

239
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:11,405
I changed so many of Michelle's diapers,
I feel like there were two of her.

240
00:16:14,742 --> 00:16:17,745
Here comes the tricky part.
Watch out for the fire hose!

241
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:18,954
Yes.

242
00:16:19,038 --> 00:16:22,458
Huh... Boom! Drop the mic.

243
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:28,214
Not me.

244
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:32,510
Uh-oh...

245
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,141
Hello?

246
00:16:40,476 --> 00:16:42,770
- <i>Stephanie?</i>
- Um, Deej...

247
00:16:42,978 --> 00:16:45,940
- Hey. What's up?
<i>- I'm just checking in.</i>

248
00:16:46,148 --> 00:16:49,485
- How is it going with Tommy?
- We've never been closer.

249
00:16:56,534 --> 00:16:57,744
What was that?

250
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,539
Oh, you know, I'm playing <i>Angry Birds</i>

251
00:17:01,622 --> 00:17:02,623
and I just shot a duck.

252
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:06,627
There's a duck in <i>Angry Birds?</i>

253
00:17:06,836 --> 00:17:08,212
It might have been a goose.

254
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:11,298
Oh, look,
I'm getting a really important phone call.

255
00:17:11,507 --> 00:17:14,134
- From who?
- Not sure. It might be a butt dial.

256
00:17:14,218 --> 00:17:15,929
Okay, bye, Deej.

257
00:17:18,514 --> 00:17:19,682
Quick thinking.

258
00:17:19,766 --> 00:17:20,892
Well, gotta go.

259
00:17:22,268 --> 00:17:23,102
Me, too.

260
00:17:24,228 --> 00:17:26,355
Have fun getting that phone back.

Moving to LA with your favorite uncle.

But if I'm in the truck,
you can use the carpool lane.

No, it's not just that.
I mean, it's everything.

278
00:18:28,668 --> 00:18:31,004
I used to live in a house full of guys.

279
00:18:31,086 --> 00:18:34,799
Now, there's women everywhere.
I'm outnumbered.

280
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:38,970
Living with women, you'll learn valuable
lessons, like how to talk to them.

281
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:41,430
Take Becky and her terrible cooking,
for instance.

282
00:18:41,514 --> 00:18:45,142
She makes this lasagna that tastes like...
What's the word...? Sweatpants.

283
00:18:46,602 --> 00:18:48,521
And I just keep feeding it to the dog

284
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:51,190
because I don't know
how to tell her how disgusting it is.

285
00:18:51,273 --> 00:18:52,859
Now our dog weighs about 300 pounds.

286
00:18:56,195 --> 00:18:58,280
It was still recording.

287
00:18:58,364 --> 00:19:01,116
She heard my whole...
She's going to kill me.

288
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:05,287
Not if we hide out in Mexico.
We could fight bulls together.

289
00:19:05,496 --> 00:19:09,333
No, it can't work because
I don't look good in matador culottes.

290
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,461
Text your mom, tell her you're with me

303
00:19:48,497 --> 00:19:51,667
I had a text from Jackson earlier
that had me a little concerned,

304
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:55,004
but it sounds like everything
went perfectly fine today.

305
00:19:55,212 --> 00:19:56,839
Fabulous.

306

And flawless.

307
00:20:00,968 --> 00:20:03,888
- So where is Jackson?
- Oh, he's upstairs somewhere.

308
00:20:04,097 --> 00:20:06,140
You know, he has been quiet as a mouse

309
00:20:06,223 --> 00:20:09,060
ever since I solved
your whole bedroom fiasco.

310

Boy, I wish I had
your amazing parenting skills.

00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:17,818
Don't feel bad. I know you do your best.

312
00:20:20,446 --> 00:20:23,240
Hey, Jackson, get in here!

313
00:20:23,449 --> 00:20:24,784
Here I am.

314
00:20:26,285 --> 00:20:29,122
Jackson, tell Team D.J. where you've been.

315
00:20:29,204 --> 00:20:31,999
Um, I was in Uncle Jesse's truck.

316
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,085
I made it all the way to Fresno.

317
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:36,503
This kid's got the bladder of a champ.

318
00:20:38,547 --> 00:20:43,510
All while Team D.J.
was being fabulous and flawless.

319
00:20:44,303 --> 00:20:46,680
Deej, I am so sorry.

320
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:48,515
Frothy cocktail?

321
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:55,439
On the bright side, three out of four
of the kids were right here all day.

322
00:20:58,151 --> 00:21:00,319
Okay, I think we need a family meeting.

323
00:21:01,236 --> 00:21:04,907
I know that look.
I feel sorry for Team D.J.

324
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,961
- I can go home. I'm not in trouble, right?
- No, I am.

325
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:18,754
It's my first day and I blew it.

326
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:21,174
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Remember my first day?

327
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:22,883
I changed Michelle on a meat rack,

328
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:25,552
and you and D.J. were go-go dancing
on top of amplifiers,

329
00:21:25,636 --> 00:21:27,387
eating sundaes and pizza all night.

330
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:29,890
You were so clueless.

331
00:21:29,974 --> 00:21:31,100
It was awesome.

332
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:34,979
Well, I learned and so will you.
I love you, Steph.

333
00:21:35,188 --> 00:21:36,856
- You, too.
- Goodbye, everybody!

334
00:21:37,064 --> 00:21:38,024
Bye!

335
00:21:39,942 --> 00:21:41,694
Uh-oh. Text from Becky...

336
00:21:41,777 --> 00:21:45,489
"Dear Jesse, me and the fat dog
are enjoying my lasagna.

337
00:21:46,115 --> 00:21:48,701
Your dinner is in the doghouse
where you'll be sleeping."

338
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:51,578
Actually, it's worth it
not to have to eat that lasagna.

339
00:21:54,207 --> 00:21:57,126
Okay, first things first...

340
00:21:57,918 --> 00:22:01,505
I don't want to be a person who wags her
finger while saying "first things first",

341
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:02,840
so I'll put this thing away.

342
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:06,886
Jackson, what were you thinking?

343
00:22:07,094 --> 00:22:10,848
Mom, you should know. You ran away
when Stephanie moved into your room.

344
00:22:11,057 --> 00:22:12,641
How would you even know that?

345
00:22:18,189 --> 00:22:19,899
Okay, in my defense,

346
00:22:19,982 --> 00:22:25,071
that was a small part of a much larger
inspirational aunt-nephew teaching moment

347
00:22:25,154 --> 00:22:27,447
gone horribly wrong.

348
00:22:29,283 --> 00:22:33,871
To your point, I ran away to the garage.
You left the county.

349
00:22:35,248 --> 00:22:38,959
Hey, let's not quibble over
whose runaway was better, okay?

350
00:22:43,214 --> 00:22:45,299
I know I shouldn't have left like that.

351
00:22:45,966 --> 00:22:47,509
I just got mad.

352
00:22:47,593 --> 00:22:52,056
I mean, first dad dies,
then we all have to move in here.

353
00:22:52,265 --> 00:22:56,393
Now there's more people moving in here,
and to top it all off, I lose my room.

354
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:00,898
Jax.

355
00:23:04,068 --> 00:23:06,862
I know this is just tough...

356
00:23:07,613 --> 00:23:10,657
but you have a house
full of people who love you.

357
00:23:12,243 --> 00:23:14,870
And as far as your room goes, I get it.

358
00:23:15,537 --> 00:23:18,540
I thought moving in with this squirt
was going to ruin my life.

359
00:23:20,751 --> 00:23:23,129
But we got really close sharing that room.

360
00:23:24,297 --> 00:23:26,006
And now you're here for me.

361
00:23:28,926 --> 00:23:32,138
You may not see it now, but living
with your brother is a blessing.

362
00:23:33,306 --> 00:23:34,431
Are you sure?

363
00:23:37,143 --> 00:23:38,894
I'm here for you, Bro.

364
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:44,150
Like the little bird that eats
the parasites off the rhino's back.

365
00:23:47,069 --> 00:23:49,446
Can anyone explain
what this kid's talking about?

366
00:23:53,492 --> 00:23:56,912
It's a classic symbiotic relationship.

367
00:23:59,456 --> 00:24:03,585
Ramona, I know this is hard on you, too,
with your dad and I separated,

368
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:05,963
but as much as I'm helping D.J.,

369
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:07,756
D.J.'s helping me.

370
00:24:09,133 --> 00:24:11,051
I'm new at this single-parent thing.

371
00:24:11,844 --> 00:24:14,096
We're all figuring this out.

372
00:24:14,763 --> 00:24:18,058
So everybody has to do their part
to make this new family work.

373
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:23,272
That means respect, compromise,
and honesty, okay?

374
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,108
I'm in. But I was never out.

375
00:24:27,818 --> 00:24:28,819
Jackson?

376
00:24:29,028 --> 00:24:30,779
Yeah, okay.

377
00:24:31,446 --> 00:24:32,614
Ramona?

378
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:36,660
I can't believe
I'm going to say this,

379
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:39,079
but if you're so desperate
to have your room back,

380
00:24:39,163 --> 00:24:40,873
I'll go live in the hobbit hole.

381
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:43,334
Yes!

382
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:45,127
That is so sweet of you,

383
00:24:45,336 --> 00:24:48,339
but I think Jackson and Max
are going to love living together.

384
00:24:48,547 --> 00:24:50,132
Oh, thank God!

385
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,094
Hey, Deej,

386
00:24:54,178 --> 00:24:56,805
in the spirit of honesty, um...

387
00:24:56,889 --> 00:25:01,227
I lost my phone in your baby's diaper
and I butt-answered your call.

388
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:03,437
What?

389
00:25:04,146 --> 00:25:07,066
Oh, like you've never lost a phone
in a diaper before.

390
00:25:08,275 --> 00:25:11,611
- No.
- Once, I lost a watch in some egg salad.

391
00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:17,910
You know what we need?
A group hug! Come on!

392
00:25:21,872 --> 00:25:24,250
Sorry, I forgot my lucky sunglasses.

393
00:25:25,251 --> 00:25:26,919
I knew there would be a hug.

394
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:31,257
Is it just me or do you hear violins?

395
00:25:37,576 --> 00:25:42,576
