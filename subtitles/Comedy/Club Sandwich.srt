1
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:05,260
Narrator:
People are always asking me

2
00:02:05,328 --> 00:02:06,920
if I know Tyler Durden.

3
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:07,697
Tyler: 3 minutes.

4
00:02:07,697 --> 00:02:08,721
Tyler: 3 minutes.

5
00:02:08,798 --> 00:02:11,892
This is it: ground zero.

6
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:14,061
Would you like to say a few
words to mark the occasion?

7
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:15,228
[Muffled]

8
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:17,101
Narrator: With a gun barrel
between your teeth,

9
00:02:17,173 --> 00:02:19,232
you speak only in vowels.

10
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:20,570
I can't think
of anything.

11
00:02:20,643 --> 00:02:22,235
For a second
I totally forget

12
00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:24,836
about Tyler's whole
controlled demolition thing,

13
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:27,075
and I wonder
how clean that gun is.

14
00:02:27,149 --> 00:02:28,912
Tyler: Getting
exciting now.

15
00:02:28,985 --> 00:02:30,009
That old saying,

16
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:32,247
how you always hurt
the one you love?

17
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:34,509
Well, it works both ways.

18
00:02:34,643 --> 00:02:35,200
[Police Sirens]

19
00:02:35,277 --> 00:02:36,710
We have front row seats

20
00:02:36,778 --> 00:02:38,803
for this theater
of  mass destruction.

21
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,212
The demolitions committee
of  Project Mayhem

22
00:02:41,283 --> 00:02:43,717
wrapped the foundation
columns of  a dozen buildings

23
00:02:43,785 --> 00:02:46,720
with blasting gelatin.
In 2 minutes,

24
00:02:46,788 --> 00:02:48,722
primary charges
will blow base charges

25
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,052
and a few square blocks

26
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,821
will be reduced
to smoldering rubble.

27
00:02:52,894 --> 00:02:53,952
I know this...

28
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:55,724
because Tyler knows this.

29
00:02:55,797 --> 00:02:57,389
2 1 /2.

30
00:02:57,465 --> 00:02:59,365
Think of  everything
we've accomplished.

31
00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:02,426
And suddenly, I realize
that all of  this:

32
00:03:02,504 --> 00:03:04,995
the gun, the bombs,
the revolution...

33
00:03:05,073 --> 00:03:08,531
has got something to do with
a girl named Marla Singer.

34
00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:13,104
Bob. Bob had bitch-tits.

35
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:17,174
This was a support group for
men with testicular cancer.

36
00:03:17,252 --> 00:03:19,686
The big moosey
slobbering all over me,

37
00:03:19,754 --> 00:03:20,743
that was Bob.

38
00:03:20,822 --> 00:03:22,983
We're still men.

39
00:03:23,058 --> 00:03:25,049
Yes, we're men.

40
00:03:25,126 --> 00:03:27,560
Men is what we are.

41
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:29,688
8 months ago, Bob's
testicles were removed.

42
00:03:29,764 --> 00:03:33,256
Then hormone therapy.
He developed bitch-tits

43
00:03:33,335 --> 00:03:35,326
because his testosterone
was too high,

44
00:03:35,403 --> 00:03:37,200
and his body
upped the estrogen.

45
00:03:37,272 --> 00:03:38,534
And that was where I fit...

46
00:03:38,607 --> 00:03:40,541
They're gonna have to
open up my pecs again

47
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:41,633
and drain the fluid.

48
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,541
Narrator: Between those huge,
sweating tits

49
00:03:43,612 --> 00:03:46,979
that hung enormous the way
you'd think of  God's as big.

50
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:50,142
OK. You cry now.

51
00:03:50,218 --> 00:03:53,710
No, wait. Back up.
Let me start earlier.

52
00:03:53,955 --> 00:03:56,788
For 6 months,
I couldn't sleep.

53
00:03:56,858 --> 00:03:59,418
Echo: I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't sleep.

54
00:03:59,494 --> 00:04:01,655
With insomnia,
nothing's real.

55
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,324
Everything's far away.

56
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:09,200
Everything's a copy
of  a copy of a copy.

57
00:04:12,073 --> 00:04:14,337
When deep space
exploration ramps up,

58
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:17,105
it'll be the corporations
that name everything:

59
00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:19,669
the l.B.M. Stellarsphere,

60
00:04:19,748 --> 00:04:21,682
the Microsof t Galaxy,

61
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,310
Planet Starbucks.

62
00:04:24,386 --> 00:04:26,013
Gonna need you out of  town
a little more this week.

63
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:27,520
We got some
red flags to cover.

64
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:28,988
It must've been Tuesday.

65
00:04:29,057 --> 00:04:31,184
He was wearing
his cornflower-blue tie.

66
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,352
You want me to deprioritize
my current reports

67
00:04:33,428 --> 00:04:35,828
until you advise
of  a status upgrade?

68
00:04:35,897 --> 00:04:37,694
Make these your primary
action items.

69
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:38,858
Here's
your flight coupons.

70
00:04:38,933 --> 00:04:40,491
Call me from the road
if there's any snags.

71
00:04:40,568 --> 00:04:42,035
Narrator:
He was full of  pep.

72
00:04:42,103 --> 00:04:45,300
Must have had
his grande latte enema.

73
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:49,202
Like so many others,
I had become a slave

74
00:04:49,277 --> 00:04:51,541
to the IKEA
nesting instinct.

75
00:04:51,613 --> 00:04:55,515
Uh, yes. I'd like to order
the Erica Pekkary dust ruffles.

76
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,550
Operator: Please hold.

77
00:04:56,618 --> 00:04:57,880
If I saw something clever

78
00:04:57,952 --> 00:05:00,944
Like a little cof fee table
in the shape of  a yin-yang,

79
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:02,819
I had to have it.

80
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:05,724
The Klipske
personal of fice unit,

81
00:05:05,794 --> 00:05:08,262
the Hovetrekke
home exer-bike,

82
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:09,990
or the Johannshamn sof a

83
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:12,329
with the Strinne green
stripe pattern.

84
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,334
Even the Rizlampa wire lamps

85
00:05:14,402 --> 00:05:17,496
of  environmentally friendly
unbleached paper.

86
00:05:17,572 --> 00:05:19,403
I'd flip through catalogs
and wonder:

87
00:05:19,474 --> 00:05:23,501
What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?

88
00:05:23,578 --> 00:05:24,943
I had it all.

89
00:05:25,013 --> 00:05:26,207
Even the glass dishes

90
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:28,181
with tiny bubbles
and imperfections.

91
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:31,343
Proof  that they were crafted
by the honest, simple,

92
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:33,182
hard-working indigenous
peoples of --

93
00:05:33,254 --> 00:05:34,186
Operator: Please hold.

94
00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:35,187
Narrator: Wherever.

95
00:05:35,256 --> 00:05:36,553
I was holding.

96
00:05:36,624 --> 00:05:39,218
We used to read pornography.

97
00:05:39,294 --> 00:05:41,353
Now it was
the Horchow collection.

98
00:05:41,429 --> 00:05:44,421
No, you can't
die from insomnia.

99
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:45,591
What about narcolepsy?

100
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:48,602
I nod of f. I wake up
in strange places.

101
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,228
I have no idea
how I got there.

102
00:05:50,305 --> 00:05:52,034
You need to lighten up.

103
00:05:52,107 --> 00:05:54,371
Can you please just
get me something?

104
00:05:54,442 --> 00:05:57,639
Narrator: Red and blue Tuenols,
lipstick-red Seconals.

105
00:05:57,712 --> 00:06:02,342
No. You need
healthy natural sleep.

106
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:05,978
Chew some Valerian root
and get more exercise.

107
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,154
Hey, come on.
I'm in pain.

108
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:12,989
You wanna see pain?

109
00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:14,790
Swing by First Methodist
Tuesday nights.

110
00:06:14,863 --> 00:06:17,957
See the guys
with testicular cancer.

111
00:06:18,032 --> 00:06:19,659
That's pain.

112
00:06:27,175 --> 00:06:29,268
Chorus: * La la la *

113
00:06:29,344 --> 00:06:31,642
* La la la la la la *

114
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,448
I always wanted 3 kids,

115
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,453
2 boys and a girl.

116
00:06:39,521 --> 00:06:43,423
Mindy wanted
2 girls and a boy.

117
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:46,426
We never could
agree on anything.

118
00:06:46,494 --> 00:06:48,462
Well, uh,
you know, she--

119
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,090
She had her first child
last week, a...

120
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,895
a girl.

121
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:56,528
With--With her, uh,
with her new husband.

122
00:06:56,604 --> 00:06:58,970
Man: [Whispering] Fuck.

123
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,136
Hey--Hey, thank God,
you know.

124
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:05,577
I'm--I'm glad for her.

125
00:07:05,647 --> 00:07:10,016
Because she deserves it.

126
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:12,644
Group Leader: Aw.

127
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,281
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.

128
00:07:16,357 --> 00:07:18,655
All: Thank you, Thomas.

129
00:07:18,726 --> 00:07:21,991
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of  courage,

130
00:07:22,063 --> 00:07:24,156
and that gives me strength.

131
00:07:24,232 --> 00:07:26,598
We give each other strength.

132
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:28,602
It's time
for the one-on-ones.

133
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,468
So let's all of  us here
follow Thomas' good example

134
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:33,973
and really open ourselves up.

135
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:36,340
Would you find a partner?

136
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,844
Narrator: And this is how
I met the big moosey...

137
00:07:40,915 --> 00:07:43,042
Man: Come on.
Let's go over here.

138
00:07:43,117 --> 00:07:46,348
His eyes already
shrink-wrapped in tears...

139
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:52,025
knees together,
those awkward little steps.

140
00:07:56,931 --> 00:07:58,023
My name is Bob.

141
00:07:58,099 --> 00:07:59,532
Bob.

142
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:02,126
Narrator: Bob had been
a champion body-builder.

143
00:08:02,203 --> 00:08:04,137
You know that
chest-expansion program

144
00:08:04,205 --> 00:08:07,299
you see on late-night TV ?
That was his idea.

145
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,138
I was a juicer.

146
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,805
You know,
using steroids.

147
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:15,611
Diabonal and...

148
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:18,151
Wistrol.
Oh, they use that

149
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:21,484
on racehorses,
for Christ sakes.

150
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:24,320
And now I'm bankrupt.

151
00:08:24,392 --> 00:08:26,485
I'm divorced.

152
00:08:26,561 --> 00:08:29,997
My 2 grown kids...

153
00:08:30,064 --> 00:08:33,864
won't even return
my phone calls.

154
00:08:33,935 --> 00:08:35,630
Narrator: Strangers
with this kind of honesty

155
00:08:35,703 --> 00:08:38,228
make me go
a big rubbery one.

156
00:08:40,575 --> 00:08:43,009
Go ahead, Cornelius.

157
00:08:43,077 --> 00:08:44,305
You can cry.

158
00:08:56,257 --> 00:08:59,283
[Crying]

159
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,796
Narrator: And then,
something happened.

160
00:09:02,864 --> 00:09:04,297
I let go.

161
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:05,832
That's really good.

162
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,891
Lost in oblivion...

163
00:09:07,969 --> 00:09:11,132
dark and silent

He had one part-timejob
as a projectionist.

See, a movie doesn't come
all on one big reel.

715

It comes on a few.

716
00:32:37,344 --> 00:32:39,835
So someone has to be there
to switch the projectors

717
00:32:39,913 --> 00:32:42,143
at the exact moment
that one reel ends

718

He flips the projectors,

726
00:32:54,862 --> 00:32:56,727
the movie keeps
right on going,

727
00:32:56,797 --> 00:32:58,264
and nobody in the audience
has any idea.

Why would anyone want
this shitjob?

interesting opportunities.

Hey, don't fuck around.

time line,

What are you doing?
Come on.

1 320 Southeast Banning,
apartment A.

1797
01:22:02,332 --> 01:22:03,663
Small, cramped basement
apartment, Raymond?

1798
01:22:03,733 --> 01:22:04,757
How did you know?

1799
01:22:04,835 --> 01:22:06,462
Because they give
shitty basement apartments

1800
01:22:06,536 --> 01:22:08,470
Ietters instead of numbers.

1801

Raymond...

1802
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,473

Oh, my God, no...

Is that your mom and dad?

1805
01:22:14,344 --> 01:22:15,834
Mom and dad are going
to have to call up

1806

kindly Dr. So-And-So

your dental records.

You want to know why?

1809

Because there's going to be
nothing left of your face.

I asked you
what you studied.

1818
01:22:35,131 --> 01:22:36,257

Yeah, I got that.

That means you have to
get more schooling.

Too much school.

1832

No...

No distractions.

Why does

need to latch on to
a strong person?

I'm not there--

2433
01:52:14,024 --> 01:52:14,956
[Dial Tone]

2434
01:52:16,159 --> 01:52:17,922
You broke
your promise.

2435
01:52:17,994 --> 01:52:18,983
Jesus, Tyler.

2436
01:52:19,062 --> 01:52:20,723
You fuckin' talked
to her about me.

2437
01:52:20,797 --> 01:52:22,526
Tyler, what the fuck
is going on here?

2438
01:52:22,599 --> 01:52:24,294
I asked you
for one thing,

2439
01:52:24,367 --> 01:52:26,062
one simple thing.

2440
01:52:26,136 --> 01:52:27,330
Why do people
think that I'm you?

2441
01:52:29,005 --> 01:52:30,199
Answer me!

2442
01:52:33,944 --> 01:52:34,876
Sit.

2443
01:52:38,281 --> 01:52:39,213
Now answer me.

2444
01:52:39,282 --> 01:52:40,772
Why do people think
that I'm you?

2445
01:52:42,085 --> 01:52:43,074
I think you know.

2446
01:52:43,153 --> 01:52:44,677
No, I don't.

2447
01:52:44,754 --> 01:52:45,812
Yes, you do.

2448
01:52:45,889 --> 01:52:48,551
Why would anyone possibly
confuse you with me?

2449
01:52:49,726 --> 01:52:52,456
Uh...l...
I don't know.

2450
01:52:56,266 --> 01:52:57,631
You got it.

2451
01:52:57,701 --> 01:52:59,134
No.

2452
01:52:59,202 --> 01:53:00,169
Do not
fuck with us.

2453
01:53:00,237 --> 01:53:01,426
Say it.

2454
01:53:02,928 --> 01:53:04,691
Because...

2455
01:53:06,131 --> 01:53:07,189
Say it.

2456
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:10,965
Because we're
the same person.

2457
01:53:11,036 --> 01:53:13,197
That's right.

2458
01:53:13,271 --> 01:53:15,432
We are the all-singing,
all dancing--

2459
01:53:15,507 --> 01:53:17,031
I don't
understand this.

2460
01:53:17,108 --> 01:53:18,040
You were looking
for a way

2461
01:53:18,109 --> 01:53:19,235
to change your life.

2462
01:53:19,311 --> 01:53:21,609
You could not do this
on your own.

2463
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:23,580
All the ways you wish
you could be,

2464
01:53:23,648 --> 01:53:25,206
that's me.

2465
01:53:26,284 --> 01:53:27,546
I look like
you wanna look,

2466
01:53:27,619 --> 01:53:28,779
I fuck like
you wanna fuck,

2467
01:53:28,854 --> 01:53:30,219
I am smart,
capable,

2468
01:53:30,288 --> 01:53:32,449
and most importantly,
I am free

2469
01:53:32,524 --> 01:53:34,048
in all the ways
that you are not.

2470
01:53:34,125 --> 01:53:35,114
Oh, no.

2471
01:53:35,193 --> 01:53:36,125
Tyler's not here.

2472
01:53:36,194 --> 01:53:37,126
Tylerwent away.

2473
01:53:37,195 --> 01:53:38,127
- Tyler's gone.
- What?

2474
01:53:38,196 --> 01:53:39,629
This is
impossible.

2475
01:53:39,698 --> 01:53:41,256
- No.
- This is crazy.

2476
01:53:41,333 --> 01:53:42,664
People do it
every day.

2477
01:53:42,734 --> 01:53:44,065
They talk
to themselves.

2478
01:53:44,135 --> 01:53:46,296
They see themselves
as they'd like to be.

2479
01:53:46,371 --> 01:53:48,305
They don't have
the courage you have,

2480
01:53:48,373 --> 01:53:49,567
tojust
run with it.

2481
01:53:53,411 --> 01:53:55,276
Naturally, you're still
wrestling with it,

2482
01:53:55,347 --> 01:53:56,814
so sometimes
you're still you.

2483
01:53:56,882 --> 01:53:58,679
We should do this
again sometime.

2484
01:53:58,750 --> 01:54:01,617
Other times, you imagine
yourselfwatching me.

2485
01:54:01,686 --> 01:54:03,017
If this is your fi rst
night at Fight Club,

2486
01:54:03,088 --> 01:54:04,180
you have to fight.

2487
01:54:04,256 --> 01:54:05,587
Little by little,

2488
01:54:05,657 --> 01:54:08,956
you'rejust letting
yourselfbecome...

2489
01:54:09,027 --> 01:54:11,427
Tyler Durden.

2490
01:54:11,496 --> 01:54:12,520
You are not
yourjob,

2491
01:54:12,597 --> 01:54:14,292
or how much money
you have in the bank!

2492
01:54:14,366 --> 01:54:15,526
No, you have
a house.

2493
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:16,794
Rented in your name.

2494
01:54:16,868 --> 01:54:18,802
You havejobs, you
have a whole life.

2495
01:54:18,870 --> 01:54:20,462
You have nightjobs
because you can't sleep.

2496
01:54:20,539 --> 01:54:22,370
Or you stay up
and make soap.

2497
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:23,964
Marla--You're
fucking Marla, Tyler.

2498
01:54:24,042 --> 01:54:26,010
Uh, technically,
you're fucking Marla.

2499
01:54:26,077 --> 01:54:27,374
But it's
all the same to her.

2500
01:54:29,714 --> 01:54:31,204
Oh, my God.

2501
01:54:32,284 --> 01:54:34,275
Nowyou see
our dilemma.

2502
01:54:34,352 --> 01:54:36,377
She knows too much.

2503
01:54:37,522 --> 01:54:38,580
I think we're going
to have to talk

2504
01:54:38,657 --> 01:54:41,854
about how this might
compromise our goals.

2505
01:54:41,927 --> 01:54:44,953
Wh--What are
you saying?

2506
01:54:45,030 --> 01:54:46,691
This is--
This is bullshit.

2507
01:54:46,765 --> 01:54:48,255
This is bullshit.

2508
01:54:48,333 --> 01:54:49,300
I'm not listening
to this.

2509
01:54:49,367 --> 01:54:50,299
You are insane.

2510
01:54:50,368 --> 01:54:52,199
No, you're insane.

2511
01:54:52,270 --> 01:54:54,795
And we simply do not
have time for this crap.

2512
01:54:57,375 --> 01:54:59,240
It's called
a changeover.

2513
01:54:59,311 --> 01:55:00,835
The movie goes on,

2514
01:55:00,912 --> 01:55:02,345
and nobody
in the audience

2515
01:55:02,414 --> 01:55:03,972
has any idea.

2516
01:55:16,962 --> 01:55:17,894
Woman: Sir!

2517
01:55:17,963 --> 01:55:19,294
Are you checking out?

2518
01:55:19,364 --> 01:55:20,558
Yeah, uh,
b-bill me.

2519
01:55:20,632 --> 01:55:22,293
I need you to
initial this list

2520
01:55:22,367 --> 01:55:23,459
of phone calls,
please.

2521
01:55:27,472 --> 01:55:28,632
When were
these made?

2522
01:55:28,707 --> 01:55:29,901
It says
right there, sir,

2523
01:55:29,975 --> 01:55:31,533
between 2:00 and 3:30
this morning.

2524
01:55:31,610 --> 01:55:32,941
No, I w--

2525
01:55:36,848 --> 01:55:37,906
Have I been
going to bed

2526
01:55:37,983 --> 01:55:39,245
earlier
every night?

2527
01:55:39,317 --> 01:55:41,342
Have I been
sleeping later?

2528
01:55:43,321 --> 01:55:46,347
Have I been Tyler
longer and longer?

2529
01:55:49,894 --> 01:55:50,826
Is anybody here?

2530
01:55:53,898 --> 01:55:56,731
Dj vu
all over again.

2531
01:55:57,802 --> 01:55:58,734
Yeah, with
enough soap,

2532
01:55:58,803 --> 01:56:00,202
we could blow up
just about anything.

2533
01:56:03,375 --> 01:56:05,400
Oh, my God.

2534
01:56:08,513 --> 01:56:09,480
Man On Telephone:
1 888.

2535
01:56:09,547 --> 01:56:10,809
I'm sorry,
who am I calling?

2536
01:56:10,882 --> 01:56:12,850
1 888 Franklin.
This is Maintenance.

2537
01:56:14,953 --> 01:56:16,386
Hello?

2538
01:56:16,454 --> 01:56:17,386
Hello?

2539
01:56:17,455 --> 01:56:19,320
1 888 Franklin Street?

2540
01:56:19,391 --> 01:56:22,485
Yes.
Can I help you?

2541
01:56:24,796 --> 01:56:26,423
Hello?

2542
01:56:26,498 --> 01:56:27,624
Yeah, yeah.

2543
01:56:27,699 --> 01:56:28,961
Uh, I need to talk
to your supervisor

2544
01:56:29,034 --> 01:56:29,966
right away.

2545
01:56:30,035 --> 01:56:30,967
Speaking.

2546
01:56:31,036 --> 01:56:31,968
OK, listen to me.

2547
01:56:32,037 --> 01:56:33,231
I think something
really terrible

2548
01:56:33,304 --> 01:56:34,271
is about to happen
at your building.

2549
01:56:34,339 --> 01:56:35,328
You have got--

2550
01:56:35,407 --> 01:56:36,635
It's under
control, sir.

2551
01:56:38,009 --> 01:56:38,976
Excuse me?

2552
01:56:39,044 --> 01:56:40,602
Don't worry
about us, sir.

2553
01:56:40,679 --> 01:56:42,078
We're solid.

2554
01:56:45,717 --> 01:56:47,014
Man On Telephone:
21 60.

2555
01:56:54,959 --> 01:56:55,983
Marla!
Marla!

2556
01:56:56,061 --> 01:56:58,052
Hey--Fuck!--Wait!

2557
01:56:59,130 --> 01:57:00,825
Wait, I gotta
talk to you!

2558
01:57:00,899 --> 01:57:02,059
Marla, Marla!

2559
01:57:02,133 --> 01:57:03,225
Yourwhacked-out
bald freaks

2560
01:57:03,301 --> 01:57:04,768
hit me with
a fucking broom!

2561
01:57:04,836 --> 01:57:06,497
They almost
broke my arm!

2562
01:57:06,571 --> 01:57:08,198
They were burning their
fi ngertips with lye,

2563
01:57:08,273 --> 01:57:09,262
the stink was
unbelievable.

2564
01:57:09,340 --> 01:57:10,272
Look--Look,
listen,

2565
01:57:10,341 --> 01:57:11,273
it's gonna take
a tremendous act

2566
01:57:11,342 --> 01:57:12,274
of faith
on your part,

2567
01:57:12,343 --> 01:57:13,310
but you've got
to hear me out.

2568
01:57:13,378 --> 01:57:15,278
Oh, here comes
an avalanche of bullshit.

2569
01:57:15,346 --> 01:57:16,813
A little more faith
than that.

2570
01:57:21,186 --> 01:57:22,118
No, listen,
I don't want to hear

2571
01:57:22,187 --> 01:57:23,119
anything
you have to say.

2572
01:57:23,188 --> 01:57:25,247
You have every
right to be...

2573
01:57:25,323 --> 01:57:27,382
Um, I'll just have
a cof fee, thanks.

2574
01:57:27,459 --> 01:57:30,394
Sir, anything you order
is free of charge, sir.

2575
01:57:30,462 --> 01:57:32,521
Why is it
free of charge?

2576
01:57:32,597 --> 01:57:33,689
Don't--Don't ask.

2577
01:57:33,765 --> 01:57:34,823
Whatever.

2578
01:57:34,899 --> 01:57:37,527
I'll have the clam chowder,
the fried chicken

2579
01:57:37,602 --> 01:57:38,694
with the baked potato
with everything,

2580
01:57:38,770 --> 01:57:40,237
and a chocolate
chiffon pie.

2581
01:57:40,305 --> 01:57:42,398
Clean food, please.

2582
01:57:42,474 --> 01:57:44,237
In that case, sir,
may I advise against

2583
01:57:44,309 --> 01:57:45,537
the lady eating
the clam chowder?

2584
01:57:45,610 --> 01:57:47,601
No clam chowder,
thank you.

2585
01:57:49,814 --> 01:57:51,338
You've got
about 30 seconds.

2586
01:57:54,085 --> 01:57:55,017
Marla, I know that
I've been acting

2587
01:57:55,086 --> 01:57:56,280
very, very strange.

2588
01:57:56,354 --> 01:57:58,515
OK, I know that
it's got to seem

2589
01:57:58,590 --> 01:57:59,648
Iike there's
2 sides to me--

2590
01:57:59,724 --> 01:58:00,656
2 sides?

2591
01:58:00,725 --> 01:58:02,022
You're Dr.Jekyll
and Mr.Jackass.

2592
01:58:02,093 --> 01:58:03,025
I deserve that,
but--

2593
01:58:03,094 --> 01:58:04,254
I've come
to realize something

2594
01:58:04,329 --> 01:58:05,261
very, very
important.

2595
01:58:05,330 --> 01:58:06,388
What?

2596
01:58:06,464 --> 01:58:07,897
The full extent
of our relationship

2597
01:58:07,966 --> 01:58:10,025
wasn't really clear
to me up until now,

2598
01:58:10,101 --> 01:58:11,295
for reasons I'm not
going to go into,

2599
01:58:11,369 --> 01:58:12,802
but the important
thing is, I know

2600
01:58:12,871 --> 01:58:14,065
that I haven't been
treating you so nice.

2601
01:58:14,139 --> 01:58:15,071
Yeah, whatever.

2602

No, no--
1 5 seconds.

1 5 seconds,
please, please.

1 5 seconds, don't
open your mouth.

I'm trying to tell you
that I'm sorry.

2606
01:58:21,980 --> 01:58:23,174
Because what
I've come to realize

2607
01:58:23,248 --> 01:58:26,012
is that I really
like you, Marla.

anything bad

2612

to happen to you
because of me.

Marla, your life
is in danger.

You need to leave
town for a while.

I need you
to arrest me.

02:00:38,717 --> 02:00:41,015
I am the leader of

acts of vandalism,

2681
02:00:54,133 --> 02:00:57,193
This is a tightly
regimented organization,

2682
02:00:57,269 --> 02:00:59,362
with many cells
capable of operating

That's our headquarters.

to make large quantities
of nitroglycerin.

2693
02:01:23,696 --> 02:01:24,754
I believe the plan

2694
02:01:24,830 --> 02:01:26,593
is to blow up
the headquarters

companies,

2696

and the T.R.W. building.

Why credit card
companies?

almighty!

2914
02:14:39,886 --> 02:14:41,751
You!

2915
02:14:41,821 --> 02:14:44,255
Hi, Marla.

2916
02:14:45,325 --> 02:14:46,292
Leave her
with me,

2917
02:14:46,359 --> 02:14:47,291

2918
02:14:47,360 --> 02:14:48,292
I'll meet you
downstairs.

2919
02:14:48,361 --> 02:14:49,293
Are you sure?

2920
02:14:49,362 --> 02:14:51,330
Yes, I'm sure.

2921
02:14:52,499 --> 02:14:54,467
You fucker!

2922
02:14:54,534 --> 02:14:55,466
What kind of sick
fucking game

2923
02:14:55,535 --> 02:14:56,467
are you
playing now,

2924
02:14:56,536 --> 02:14:57,468
putting me
on a fucking bu--

2925
02:14:57,537 --> 02:14:59,437
Oh, my God,
your face!

2926
02:14:59,506 --> 02:15:00,939
Yeah, I know.

2927
02:15:05,745 --> 02:15:07,679
What happened?

2928
02:15:07,747 --> 02:15:08,907
Don't ask.

2929
02:15:08,982 --> 02:15:09,914
You're shot.

2930
02:15:09,983 --> 02:15:11,348
Yes, I'm shot.

2931
02:15:11,418 --> 02:15:12,942
Oh, my God.

2932
02:15:13,019 --> 02:15:14,452
I can't believe
he's standing.

2933
02:15:14,521 --> 02:15:15,954
One tough
motherfucker.

2934
02:15:19,826 --> 02:15:21,691
Who did this?

2935
02:15:21,761 --> 02:15:24,286
I did, actually.

2936
02:15:24,364 --> 02:15:25,763
Find some gauze.

2937
02:15:27,767 --> 02:15:29,826
You shot
yourself?

2938
02:15:29,903 --> 02:15:30,961
Yes, but it's OK.

2939
02:15:31,037 --> 02:15:32,595
Marla, look at me.

2940
02:15:32,672 --> 02:15:34,936
I'm really OK.

2941
02:15:35,008 --> 02:15:36,976
Trust me.

2942
02:15:37,043 --> 02:15:38,772
Everything's
gonna be fi ne.

2943
02:15:51,858 --> 02:15:53,655
You met me at
a very strange time

2944
02:15:53,727 --> 02:15:54,989
in my life.

2945
02:15:57,030 --> 02:15:58,520
*With your feet
on the air*

2946
02:15:58,598 --> 02:16:01,089
*And your head

*Way out in the water,
see it swimming *

2956
02:16:44,300 --> 02:16:48,031
* I was swimming
in the Caribbean *

2957
02:16:51,007 --> 02:16:56,445
*Animals were hiding
behind the rock*

2958
02:16:56,513 --> 02:16:58,606
* Except for little fish *

2959
02:16:58,681 --> 02:17:00,012
*When they told me
east is west *

2960
02:17:00,083 --> 02:17:02,244
*Trying to talk
to me, coy koi *

2961
02:17:02,318 --> 02:17:05,287
*Where is my mind? *

02:17:05,355 --> 02:17:07,255
*Where is my mind? *

2963
02:17:07,323 --> 02:17:11,726
*Where is my mind? *

2964
02:17:19,068 --> 02:17:25,837
*Way out in the water,
see it swimming *

2965
02:17:39,155 --> 02:17:40,520
*With your feet
on the air*

2966
02:17:40,590 --> 02:17:43,184
*And your head
on the ground *

2967
02:17:46,196 --> 02:17:49,996
*Try this trick
and spin it, yeah *

2968
02:17:51,701 --> 02:17:55,228
*Your head'll collapse
if there's nothing in it *

2969
02:17:55,305 --> 02:17:57,364
*And you'll ask yourself*

2970
