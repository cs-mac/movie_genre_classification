00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,710
How can she give such cheap smiles?

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,970
- Where did you two go?
- Why are you so curious?

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,960
Hey, Oh Jin Hee! I called you so
many times but you didn't pick up.

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,950
- Where do you think we are?
- Seriously...

<i>[The heart that can't be hidden?!]</i>

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,700
About your dismissal notice...
Don't worry too much about it!

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,510
He talked even to the
hospital director.

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,320
Chief Gook did?

<i>[Emergency Couple
Best Moments from the Last Episode]</i>

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,850
We'll have CPR practice.

12
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,120
Precisely.

13
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,240
What the heck are you doing right now!

14
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,130
What's wrong with you, bastard?

15
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,290
What the heck are you doing,
disguised as practice?

18
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,380
Quiet, quiet...

19
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,050
Be quiet!

20
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,880
Stay quiet!

21
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,800
- Hello?
<i>- Dr. Oh, where are you right now?</i>

22
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,410
<i>- We have a patient.</i>
- I'm coming over right now.

23
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,920
This way.

24
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,330
My baby is burning up!

25
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,800
Please calm down...

26
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,850
He only had a little bit
of formula all day...

27
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,480
but he threw up all of it just now.

28
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,060
- How old is he?
- He's six months old.

29
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,440
Does he have any problem
going to the bathroom?

30
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,320
No, he pooped a big
mound this afternoon,

31
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,200
and it wasn't even
anything loose.

32
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,980
It's 39.5 degrees.

33
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,390
I'll check the baby's throat.

34
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,350
His tonsils are swollen.
He has a fever, too.

35
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,080
Tonsils?
Then why did he throw up and...

36
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,170
Babies throw up when they have a fever.

37
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,880
Did you give him any fever reliever?

38
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,260
Fever reliever? No, no...

39
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,640
I don't even know where
it is at home...

40
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,530
I was just so scared, so I
took him and ran over here.

41
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,700
- Only if my sister-in-law was there...
- Your sister-in-law?

42
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,760
- Oh, my wife's sister is a doctor.
- She is?

43
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,630
I'll prescribe a fever reliever and
something for the inflammation.

44
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,340
Please give him the medicine
and check his fever.

45
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,650
Yes, I will.

46
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,570
You can leave after the
baby's fever is down.

47
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,760
Give him the medicine and if he gets
worse tomorrow, please come back.

48
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,230
Yes, I got it.

49
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,760
My goodness... That's a relief.

50
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,350
Your throat just hurts a little...

51
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,310
If your mom was around, you'd
get better in no time, right?

52
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,800
I envy you.
You're a competent specialist

53
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
and you know how to enjoy
your hobby in your busy life.

54
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,460
- You can do it with me.
- How can I be your partner?

55
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,310
You can start from the basics again.

56
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,390
How many years has it been
since I learned it from you?

57
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,570
Wouldn't you do it better this time
since you've already tried it once?

58
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,840
Dating is like that.
Even marriage, too.

59
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,550
I think I can do better
if we start again.

60
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,270
You did well. I'm always the problem.

61
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,030
Hello? Yes, speaking.

62
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,590
Which hospital is it?

63
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,110
Excuse me, I'll call you back.

64
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,880
Why? Is someone sick?

65
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,970
It's nothing. You don't need to worry.
I'll get going first.

66
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,060
Go ahead.

67
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,750
Bye.

68
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:39,910
Mom, it's me. How bad is Ji Min doing?
I got a call from the hospital.

69
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,060
You should've called me sooner
when something like that happened!

70
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:50,400
Don't worry about me. Just call me
when the kid is sick next time. Okay?

71
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,990
How is he doing now?

72
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,010
That's a relief.

73
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,470
Yes, I'm going to call
the hospital again.

74
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,050
Okay, bye.

75
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,690
Hello? Yes...

76
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,770
My back!

77
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,260
How long did I walk
with her on my back?

78
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,330
For such a small person,
she's so heavy.

79
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:30,050
Why can't I get away from
Oh Jin Hee and things be different?

80
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,790
My back! My disc in my back...

81
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,220
Good morning.

82
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,850
Here is the chart.

83
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,660
Thanks for working overnight.

84
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,670
- Go now.
- Yes.

85
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,600
Right, Oh Jin Hee!

86
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,160
I'm crazy! Crazy!

87
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,090
Why was I sleeping in there?

88
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,710
Alcohol is my enemy!

89
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,260
Taxi!

90
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,210
- Hello, taxi!
- Get out right now!

91
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,570
Oh Jin Hee, where is your home?

92
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,990
Oh Chang Min, that punk
threw me in there!

93
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,860
You...

94
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,380
How am I going to face Chief Gook now?

95
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,150
You stupid foolish idiot!

96
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,600
You really don't know?
You had no idea?

97
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,140
No.

98
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,700
Then why did you come in here?

99
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,460
Just... I thought I'd take a short nap.

100
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,150
Then you were here together
the whole night...

101
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,650
What's this?

102
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,460
It's Oh Jin Hee's.

103
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,120
Take a nap. This is my spot,
so go somewhere else.

104
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,120
What? Yes.

105
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,760
Just where... is it?

106
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,130
No way...

107
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,370
I'm sure it's not.

108
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:29,370
It can't be, right?
It's not, please? No...

109
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:34,560
No... What do I do? I'm going crazy...

110
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,150
Good morning! Oh? You're here early.

111
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,370
I do come here early.

112
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,630
It looks like you never
went home last night.

113
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,410
It just happened that way.

114
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,200
You were drinking a lot last night.

115
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,740
I wonder how you behave
when you get drunk.

116
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,730
Oh, right! Professor Shim was
looking for you just now.

117
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,430
- Me?
- Yes.

118
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,220
It can't be about sleeping
together, can it?

119
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,720
Who did you sleep with?

120
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,410
How gross... Gross!

121
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,040
This is driving me nuts!

122
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,310
I heard... you were looking for me.

123
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,370
Oh Jin Hee...
why do you think I called you?

124
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,790
Well, I'm not sure...

125
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:33,490
I know you're an intern full of
energy, but you're not too young...

126
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,210
It's not at all because
I'm full of energy.

127
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,020
I just somehow fell asleep there...

128
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,850
I didn't know it was Chief Gook's bed,
I didn't know he was sleeping there...

129
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,260
I was crazy for a minute... I'm sorry!

130
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,820
What are you talking about right now?

131
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,130
Pardon?

132
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,450
You slept with Chief Gook in his bed?

133
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,420
Isn't it why you looked for me?

134
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,570
I heard your dismissal decision was
reverted and you get to work again.

135
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:08,150
That's why I said this.
You're an intern

136
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,730
full of energy who
started late...

137
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,130
so please don't cause
anymore trouble and focus

138
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,530
on your work unless you
want to get fired again.

139
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,600
And now what?

140
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,150
You slept with Chief Gook?

141
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,130
What do I do? What do I do?

142
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:35,810
How can I trust him?
Oh Chang Min, this mutt...

143
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,630
This Oh Chang Min, seriously!

144
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,140
Come on, come on, come on...

145
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,680
Did you drink last night?

146
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,500
Yes.

147
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,800
Why? You don't like the
female staff room?

148
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,150
There was no empty bed?

149
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,780
Is this how you're going to behave?

150
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,290
I'm sorry...

151
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,000
Chief! Where are you going right now?

152
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,950
I'm meeting with the director. Why?

153
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,380
Well, it looks like you have
something on your pants.

154
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,560
What?

155
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,210
The other side...

156
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,980
It looks like a piece of gum.

157
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,860
There is nothing.

158
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,230
On the other side... Here. Yes!

159
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,500
Chief, what do you have here?

160
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,830
- What is it?
- Hey...

161
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,100
It's gum!

162
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,800
- Who put a piece of gum here?
- Hey, let go of it.

163
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,730
- Hold on.
- What are you doing?

164
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,220
- It's almost done, almost done.
- What are you doing?

165
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,090
- Just a little more.
- Hey!

166
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,290
Hold still. I got it all.

167
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,150
What are you two doing right now?

168
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:09,060
Hey! What now? It hurts...

169
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,350
- What did you do with the Chief?
- What do you mean?

170
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,630
He had a piece of gum on his
pants, so I got it off.

171
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,420
His pants? Not his butt, but his pants?

172
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,350
His butt? What are you talking about?

173
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,860
Oh, that's right. You threw me away
in the male staff room and left.

174
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,690
- How can you do that?
- Stop...

175
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,360
- Do you like him?
- What?

176
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,250
I'm asking if you like Chief!

177
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,310
Yes. Why?

178
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:44,760
- You do? You've gone completely mad.
- What?

179
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,960
So, are you going to date him?

180
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,090
What does it have to do with you?

181
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,010
It has a little bit to
do with me, since it'll

182
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,930
put me in an extremely
awkward position.

183
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,920
Why would you feel awkward
regardless of who I like?

184
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,510
Hey, Oh Jin Hee! In front of me...

185
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:03,970
How can I not feel awkward when
my ex-wife is dating someone?

186
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,110
- How can a human being not?
- Hey, Oh Chang Min!

187
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,390
You and I are over.

188
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,390
What relationship do
we have between us?

189
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,970
Tune yourself out!

190
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,540
- What a joke.
- Hey! Hey!

191
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,560
- Give those to me. I'll carry them.
- Thank you, Yong Gyu.

192
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,790
I'll do this, too! Let me.

193
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,840
Thank you!

194
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,320
Where should I put this...

195
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,260
I should be doing this.

196
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,550
What's with him?

197
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,110
After sleeping together for a
night, this girl is seriously...

198
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,510
Someone had one night stand?

199
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,290
One night stand?

200
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,430
That's right.

201
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,090
My lips didn't even get to touch it.

202
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,700
- Yong Gyu.
- What?

203
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,770
What on earth... do you call this?

204
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:53,940
What do you mean?

205
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:58,820
This part right here... Look, here...

206
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:02,840
Things are boiling over right in here!

207
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,410
- Isn't it diarrhea?
- That's not it, punk!

208
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,030
Right here... This is driving me crazy!

209
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,910
Did I go crazy?

210
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,080
For me, it's really hot
right here these days.

211
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,090
Sometimes it tickles...

212
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,840
and sometimes it feels like
it's going to explode.

213
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,910
Do you have a heart problem?

214
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,670
That's not it!

215
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,190
No!

216
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,000
I didn't even get to take one sip!

217
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,340
He can't even put it in the trash can.

218
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:59,550
It looks like you spent a
lot of money on this...

219
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,790
but you have no one coming.
How can you run a business like this?

220
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:06,970
Well, that's because we got fined
once, and the rumor spread...

221
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,040
Don't worry.
We have a group reservation later.

222
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,100
Really?

223
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,890
My, my, my... it's true!

224
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,830
If you're that worried, why
don't you bring clients?

225
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,470
For a man to be sitting at home...

226
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,620
Of course I want to do that...

227
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,290
but who's going to
take care of my Gook?

228
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,330
If you'd take care of him...

229
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,430
Why would I? What's his mom doing?

230
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,250
Go find her!

231
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,710
Even if I find her...

232
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:43,470
Both of us should be working.
How else can we make a living?

233
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:49,660
And... just like Jin Ae,
I'm also a musician, too.

234
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,520
Musician, my butt...

235
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,540
You seduced my daughter and didn't
even have a wedding ceremony...

236
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,580
You just had a baby...

237
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,710
What's going on with
him all of a sudden?

238
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,790
Gook! Gook!

239
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,880
- Gook!
- What's going on?

240
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,840
You said his fever went down earlier.

241
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,520
Let me see... Oh my, he's burning up.

242
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:30,050
Doctor... The one I saw earlier...

243
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,080
Excuse me, but please register first.

244
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,790
The doctor who treated my baby
yesterday, come out right now!

245
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,280
- What's going on?
- My Gook, my Gook...

246
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,820
He's sick again.

247
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,590
- He had convulsions, too?
- Yes.

248
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:51,140
His eyes flipped on the way here...

249
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,110
Did you give him
fever reliever?

250
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,070
Of course, the doctor
prescribed it yesterday...

251
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,610
- Who was on night duty last night?
- It was Dr. Oh Chang Min.

252
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:58,790
If he's still in the hospital,
tell him to come.

253
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,980
I'll call him.

254
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,730
After taking fever
reliever, if you leave the

255
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,610
baby in many layers, his
fever won't go down.

256
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,550
When babies have high fever,
they can have convulsions...

257
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,390
Purpura...

258
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:17,010
What's this? What's going on?

259
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,500
It's blood coagulation called purpura.

260
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,980
Hurry up and get ready to give a line.
Call Chief Gook, too.

261
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,300
Yes.

262
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,840
You came last night...

263
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,110
Fever, vomiting,
convulsion, purpura...

264
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,280
what should you suspect?

265
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,390
Oh Chang Min!

266
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:41,020
- Meningococcal meningitis...
- What disease is it?

267
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,910
- Is it serious?
- Let's get the test done first.

268
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:47,490
- The baby is in danger now.
- In danger?

269
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,770
You said he was fine and
told me to leave last night!

270
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,780
What did you check?

271
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,900
His tonsils were inflamed, so I
thought it was a common cold...

272
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,830
Let's save the baby first.
Give me the line.

273
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,690
Who the hell are you? A cold?

274
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,310
Are you sure you're a
doctor, you bastard?

275
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,250
- Let's move him to a room.
- Yes.

276
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,330
What the heck are you doing?

277
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,290
You're a doctor here?

278
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,730
He's the doctor who
almost killed my Gook.

279
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,550
Are you okay?

280
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,140
He has difficulty of
breathing and cyanosis...

281
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,720
and his pulse is 140.

282
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,750
Get ready to cuff saline and
prepare for lumbar puncture.

283
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,800
Yes.

284
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,850
Did you get the blood test result back?

285
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:00,380
It's 9200 for white blood
cells and 9.2 on CRP.

286
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,320
Oh Chang Min, are you the
one who sent him home?

287
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,800
Other than inflamed tonsils,
there wasn't any...

288
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,170
Stop with the excuses!

289
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,990
Don't you know you to
check for meningitis for

290
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,810
babies under two even if
symptoms are not clear?

291
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,790
What about the baby's mother?

292
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,230
It doesn't sound like
she can be reached.

293
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,570
What?

294
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,070
You have to take this right now.

295
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,230
I'm not sick.

296
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,750
- Just my Gook...
- It's from contagious bacteria...

297
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:36,810
So it's preventative medicine for
people who were close to him.

298
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,840
- For the baby...
- Okay, I'll take it.

299
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,170
It's meningitis, caused by bacteria.

300
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:58,540
He can recover quickly
with antibiotics.

301
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,350
What's the worst case scenario?

302
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:09,610
As long-term side effects, it could
cause neurological and organ damage...

303
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,460
But the probability of
recovery is higher.

304
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,610
It's all my fault.
Because I was stupid...

305
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,130
I just made Jin Ae go through a lot...

306
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,910
She's worried a lot about him...

307
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,730
I called her.

308
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:29,810
If you'd seen him in the first place,
things would've been different.

309
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:33,060
Why is that stupid bastard
calling himself a doctor...

310
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,560
He's an intern! Just an intern!

311
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,760
I'm an intern, too.

312
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,130
Even if it was a
specialist, not an intern,

313
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,490
it's not easy to tell it
apart from a cold.

314
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:46,370
Even if that's the case, I'm
going to kill that bastard!

315
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,520
Brother-in-law!

316
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,580
It's you, my brother-in-law, right?

317
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,450
It's me! Jin Ae!

318
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,680
Jin Ae? Oh Jin Ae?

319
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,850
Yes, it's me, Jin Ae.

320
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,490
You became really cool looking.
Awesome!

321
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,550
Hey!

322
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:22,740
- Sister.
- Sister? Brother-in-law?

323
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,650
What a joke. Follow me!

324
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,500
Let go of me!

325
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,550
Talk to me after you let go.
Where is my Gook?

326
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,860
Are you even worried about him?

327
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,270
As if it wasn't enough to leave
home, you got knocked up...

328
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,230
What are you doing right now, after
abandoning your child as a mom?

329
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:47,150
Are you out of your mind?
Do you want to die at my hands?

330
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,590
You became a doctor, and the first
thing you say is you want to kill me?

331
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,660
You're no joke.

332
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,390
- You're seriously...
- Brother-in-law!

333
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:57,740
- What are you doing?
- Please help me! Spare me!

334
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,160
Shut up and come here!

335
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,320
That's enough.
Send her to the baby first.

336
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,940
Who are you to meddle
in my family business?

337
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,270
I treated the baby and
she's his guardian.

338
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:12,900
- Where is my Gook, Brother-in-law?
- Brother-in-law?

339
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,480
I told you to shut up! Come here!

340
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,530
Please stop her, Brother-in-law!

341
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,830
Stop.

342
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,870
Go in.

343
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,310
Are you his guardian?

344
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,080
Yes.

345
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,870
Please come this way and hold the baby.

346
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,220
Like this.

347
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,560
Is Jin Ae here?

348
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,070
You two were talking.

349
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,450
I'm... sorry.

350
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,490
Let's talk later.

351
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:10,050
- Are you giving 20 CC an hour?
- Yes, it's going fine.

352
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,690
- What about vitals?
- Blood pressure 80/50...

353
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,150
pulse is 120 and
respiration rate is 35.

354
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,250
Lumbar puncture is over.

355
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,360
Take her outside.

356
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,110
Please wait outside.

357
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,340
It's okay. Gook will get better soon.
Don't worry.

358
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,030
His dehydration is severe and
his blood pressure is too low.

359
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,940
Purpura is not going away either.

360
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,660
It might also be encephalitis,
not just meningitis.

361
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,450
Encephalitis?

362
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,950
Please get a monitor
ready to lower the ICP.

363
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,390
Yes, I got it.

364
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:03,150
I'm really going crazy...

365
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:08,020
He's through the critical point,
so don't worry too much.

366
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,860
We'll use general antibiotics, and
he'll get better in a few weeks.

367
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:15,850
Thank you. Thank you!

368
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,770
Do you know them?

369
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,300
It's my sister. She's my little sister.

370
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,470
Really?

371
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,590
Then it's your nephew.

372
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,570
- You must've been very worried.
- I'm okay.

373
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,980
Thank you for your hard work.

374
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:38,060
Then...

375
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:13,630
I hope it doesn't
spread to encephalitis.

376
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:18,440
- Why? Are you worried about something?
- Huh?

377
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,960
It's nothing.

378
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,500
You were good with the
baby patient, too.

379
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:28,190
It's the worst moment for a
mom when her baby is sick.

380
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,720
How do you know so well
when you are not a mom?

381
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,110
No way! I'm sure she thought
it was someone else.

382
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:37,220
It's true! I definitely heard it!

383
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:42,180
Some flimsy punk girl came up to Chang
Min and called him 'brother-in-law'!

384
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,460
Then what happened?
Did he recognize her?

385
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:48,660
Huh? After that, I didn't get to see
what happened because I was busy.

386
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,330
- I was really busy today.
- See?

387
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,200
So how can you say that?

388
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,930
I'm going home now.

389
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:58,970
Ah Reum!

390
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:05,360
If you have time tonight, why
don't we have dinner together?

391
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,480
I made a reservation at a nice place.

392
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:12,700
No, I'm busy...

393
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,720
Well, I'll head out first!

394
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,450
Excuse me, Ah Reum! Ah Reum!

395
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,940
I'm so tired...

396
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,540
Excuse me!

397
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,050
Are you... better now?

398
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,570
I'm sorry about earlier.

399
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:35,820
When I think about my
Gook, I still get upset.

400
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,110
But I'm letting it go for Jin Hee.

401
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:41,320
- Look...
- I heard you're her intern colleague.

402
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,840
Here.

403
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,840
What is this?

404
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,520
It's not much...

405
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,930
It's a collection of my favorite songs.

406
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:57,570
You didn't go home and stayed
at work because of my baby...

407
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,380
You can just listen to it.

408
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,430
- No, it's okay.
- Thank you.

409
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,110
Loud!

410
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:48,880
<i>My love is leaving...
My love is leaving from me...</i>

411
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,430
About Dr. Oh Jin Hee's nephew...

412
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:47,040
His ICP is down, but his blood
pressure is not going up.

413
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,310
Is it DIC?

414
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:53,440
So I had a FAP added on and
secured a line with a needle.

415
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,600
We'll just have to wait and see.

416
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,970
Can I ask you something?

417
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,420
With Oh Jin Hee...

418
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,880
It's nothing.

419
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,390
Why do you stop in the middle of it?

420
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,690
It's nothing.

421
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:21,530
What right do I have
to ask you about it?

422
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:27,280
Anyway, weren't you the one who stopped
Oh Jin Hee from getting fired?

423
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,550
I thought it was resolved after you
met with the hospital director...

424
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,070
but I guess that's not what happened.

425
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:35,060
- What are you saying?
- I don't know the details either...

426
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,340
If you're curious, you should
ask the ER director yourself.

427
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,040
What are you looking for, Miss?

428
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,780
I'm buying a gift... for a man.

429
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:01,470
Do you have any preference
for color or design?

430
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:06,110
Well... I don't know much about that.

431
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:08,250
What's the age range?

432
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:12,090
- I'll just take a look around.
- Yes, please do.

433
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,750
Chang Min!

434
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,430
Ah Reum!

435
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:07,060
Wow, you look great.

436
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,980
Aren't you tired?
You've been on night duty.

437
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,620
I'm really tired, but I
can't fall asleep tonight.

438
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,900
You must have a lot to think about.
Did something happen?

439
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,670
It's nothing.

440
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:23,660
I've been staying up late these days
to help with Resident Jang's paper...

441
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,470
But I got stuck, so I came to exercise.

442
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:28,290
Oh, the paper that Professor
Ahn is preparing?

443
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:32,830
Yes. Do you have any helpful
books, by any chance?

444
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,320
It's up there.

445
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,790
Wait.

446
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:08,350
Why haven't you accepted...
my request to start dating yet?

447
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,740
Here.

448
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:23,960
Of course dating doesn't start
with 'ready, start dating!'

449
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:30,370
But I get more calls from
your mother than you...

450
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:33,170
so I feel a bit awkward.

451
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:36,700
My parents are curious about you, too.

452
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:40,020
I want to learn about
how you can be so

453
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:43,340
passionate and
hard-working as a doctor.

454
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:48,930
But I'm not interested in
dating or marriage yet.

455
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:50,270
I'm sorry.

456
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,490
I see.

457
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:57,620
I don't want to put pressure on you...

458
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:01,530
But... please keep me in
mind a little longer.

459
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:03,800
I'm a pretty nice girl.

460
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:12,480
By the way, I heard someone called
you 'brother-in-law' today.

461
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,870
Yong Gyu heard it.

462
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:23,350
He could've misheard it.

463
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:26,380
Well, Ah Reum.

464
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,660
To be honest, marriage was...

465
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,360
I'll get going now.
Thanks for the book!

466
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,580
Okay.

467
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:40,930
Yes, Mom.

468
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:43,000
<i>I hear someone leaving.</i>

469
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,900
<i>- Was someone there?</i>
- It was Ah Reum.

470
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,670
Really? I shouldn't have called you.

471
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:51,550
She left.

472
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:52,920
Why would you let her go at this hour?

473
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:55,110
Are you sure you're a man?

474
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:56,640
Really...

475
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,880
I guess you're dating here and there.

476
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,660
- Of course you should.
- What's going on?

477
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:04,700
You asked Uncle for something, right?

478
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,570
Your aunt told me.
She heard him talk to you on the phone.

479
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:08,860
What?

480
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:11,640
Well... there is nothing like that.

481
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:15,740
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Good night then.

482
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:18,980
<i>- Chang Min!</i>
- What now?

483
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:26,040
I asked your dad for a divorce.

484
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:28,390
Really?

485
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:33,790
Yes. So please, let's see
some progress with Ah Reum.

486
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:36,240
I need to get you married
off before my divorce.

487
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,500
Did he agree to it?

488
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,590
We'll get a divorce
when I say we get it.

489
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:39,680
Who cares about him?

490
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,260
Do you think getting a divorce is easy?

491
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:44,070
You told me to get a divorce.
Why do you keep flipping?

492
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,290
I know because I've done it myself.

493
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:49,600
Think carefully one more time.

494
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,820
My son, what's wrong
with you these days?

495
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:57,360
Anyways... I have to wash
up and go to bed. Bye.

496
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,690
<i>Hey! Chang Min!</i>

497
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:04,940
Divorce...

498
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,740
- You understand what I mean, right?
- How many times did I say I do?

499
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:19,230
So my brother-in-law is not
in this hospital, right?

500
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:20,620
You keep saying 'brother-in-law'!

501
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:24,000
Then what should I call him?
Ex-brother-in-law?

502
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,070
Seriously...

503
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:28,140
What's wrong with being together?

504
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,520
Do you want Mom to have
her inside flipped

505
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,900
out and her blood
pressure exploded?

506
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,220
You alone are more
than enough right now!

507
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,920
Anyway, I'm sorry about
the whole thing.

508
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,880
Take good care of my Gook.

509
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,100
- What about you?
- I need to make a living.

510
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,180
I have three part-time jobs.

511
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,700
You got any money?

512
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,940
Seriously, you!

513
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,840
Mom is almost here, so behave!

514
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,570
She only has two daughters, but how
messed up are we, you and me both!

515
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:00,700
How can you say that
to your older sister!

516
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:03,790
So make sure to behave!

517
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:12,730
Is Gook really okay?

518
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:15,450
That's what I said.
Let's see how it goes.

519
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:20,390
I should've come with him earlier!
But the group came all together...

520
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:23,350
I'm sorry.

521
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:31,670
Look... Is that Jin Ae?

522
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:33,960
Yes.

523
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,960
Get out. Get out right now!

524
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,490
- Mom, we're in the hospital!
- Come out now!

525
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:44,800
Mother! Mother!

526
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,750
Even if we were not in the hospital,
I wouldn't leave you alone tonight!

527
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:51,220
I'm sorry, Mom! I'm sorry!

528
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,810
Honey, come here and beg!

529
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:55,430
Mother, please forgive us since
it's already happened...

530
00:47:55,430 --> 00:48:00,180
Forgive? I did not raise
my child in a proper way.

531
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:03,880
What's this hair and this look?

532
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,420
Mother, please calm down!
Please calm down!

533
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,590
Please hit me! Please hit me instead!

534
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:12,500
- You punk...
- No, no!

535
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,120
Mom, stop! Stop!

536
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:20,550
You came here because
you're worried about Gook!

537
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:24,510
My baby!

538
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:29,640
My baby... My my poor baby...

539
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,910
I'm sorry you didn't get to see
your Grandma for six months.

540
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:34,990
You must've wanted to
see me for six months.

541
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:36,720
Yes, of course.

542
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,100
Yes, get better soon. Okay?

543
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:45,100
If Goddess of Babies doesn't help you,
I'm going to fire her right away!

544
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:02,560
<i>Ah Reum, I'm seeing a different world
and greeting a beautiful morning.</i>

545
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:06,120
<i>- I'll send you a beautiful song.</i>
- What the heck is with him?

546
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,950
Is he proposing to her in public?

547
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:13,900
<i>Ah Reum, please look closely!</i>

548
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:03,920
Awesome!

549
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,510
Take a look at this!

550
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:13,200
Already a response...

551
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,690
Of course Ah Reum would...

552
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,340
It's Chang Min...

553
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,280
<i>Are you proposing in public?</i>

554
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:24,510
What is he talking about?
Proposing in public?

555
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,420
What's this?

556
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,530
<i>What the heck is this
early in the morning?</i>

557
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,670
<i>- Congratulations.</i>
- Man, it's a group chat room!

558
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:38,180
<i>Yong Gyu, are you being taken?</i>

559
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,160
<i>Goosebumps!</i>

560
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:45,190
<i>Be mine? Awesome.</i>

561
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:48,030
<i>Please share something like
this between the two of you.</i>

562
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,350
What is this?

563
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:59,020
Well, it's not anything special...

564
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:01,900
Just a token of appreciation...

565
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:04,490
What appreciation?

566
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:07,840
Just for a lot of things...

567
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:12,030
I appreciate you let
me continue working...

568
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:17,650
And I'm sorry about what happened
in the staff room that night...

569
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:20,170
I'm okay, so take it back.

570
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:24,320
Please just consider it as
my thank you and accept it.

571
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:28,360
Big Rock.

572
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,720
- Why do you have this...
- Why do you think?

573
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,470
It's from the staff room that night.

574
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:47,750
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

575
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:50,390
Okay, you can go.

576
00:51:57,770 --> 00:52:00,540
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

577
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,990
What's going on? What's with her?

578
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:07,650
What's this?

579
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:10,940
This? It's nothing.

580
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:12,880
Did Oh Jin Hee give that to you?

581
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,950
I should knock before
I come in next time.

582
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:20,750
What's going on?

583
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:22,720
I wanted to ask you about this patient.

584
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,980
- Hello.
- Hello.

585
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:38,090
Here he comes!

586
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:40,850
- Yo baby!
- Yo baby, yo!

587
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:43,080
You're cute!

588
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,070
- Oh my god!
- Good morning, everybody!

589
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:57,960
- Did you see?
- What?

590
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,310
You haven't seen it?

591
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:02,290
Yong Gyu proposed to you in public.
You really haven't seen it?

592
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:03,700
What?

593
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,000
Give me your cellphone.

594
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,400
My cellphone was broken, so I left it
to get it repaired on my way here.

595
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:14,870
- Yong Gyu!
- Yong Gyu!

596
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:18,250
- Are you okay?
- My head.

597
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:20,040
What's this about proposing in public?

598
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,610
Yong Gyu, what does that mean?

599
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:24,620
Did you propose to me?

600
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:26,350
It's not that...

601
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,240
Then... is this flower pot also you?

602
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:35,180
Oh... really?

603
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,340
You left it here?

604
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:42,010
I wondered who it was.

605
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:46,000
- You didn't know, Ah Reum?
- No.

606
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,310
Where did it go wrong?

607
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:51,220
My head...

608
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,850
You're really not going to tell me?

609
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:56,730
What did my son ask from you?

610
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:59,290
What did Sung Ja say to you?

611
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:01,740
Don't blame her. Just tell me!

612
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,870
How can there be a secret?
Especially in the family!

613
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:08,130
- I'm busy. I have to go right now.
- Sung Gil!

614
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:11,680
There is no secret.
Sung Ja heard it wrong.

615
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:16,210
Chang Min is not moving his lips!
How can there be no one on my side?

616
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:19,820
- I am the outcast of this family.
- You're right about that...

617
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,540
but it won't be used against you.
So just keep quiet.

618
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:25,810
Against me?
What's for me and what's against me?

619
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:28,670
Think about the best possible
case for you right now.

620
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:32,120
Are we playing 20 questions right now?
What are you doing?

621
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:35,330
I'm keeping it buried for
later, so don't try to dig.

622
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:38,500
And don't bother your busy
son who's working hard.

623
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:46,130
I'm dying to know!

624
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,230
You're here.

625
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:51,900
Have a seat.

626
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,080
What did you want to talk about?

627
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:58,260
I thought you should know...

628
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:02,240
Do you know how Oh Jin Hee got
to continue her internship?

629
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,490
The hospital director...

630
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:06,730
Of course he reversed
the dismissal decision.

631
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:12,680
But... it happened because
Director Yoon Sung Gil's word.

632
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:15,170
Yoon Sung Gil? You mean, Yoon Hospital?

633
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:18,120
Yes, Oh Chang Min's uncle.

634
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:21,680
Then Oh Chang Min did...

635
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,880
He must've wanted to resolve
it since they did it together.

636
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,780
Anyway, he used his family
to spare our intern.

637
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:34,400
I wonder if we should be nice to
Oh Chang Min going forward...

638
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:39,620
What?

639
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:44,200
Nothing. That's great.

640
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,420
It's good that we got to save her.

641
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:58,010
Did he go somewhere again?

642
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:00,950
He has an important meeting
with the governor today...

643
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:02,920
I'll tell him you came by.

644
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,890
I called ahead, so you
don't need to worry.

645
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:06,620
Yes.

646
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:19,660
Where did he leave the divorce paper?

647
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:23,130
Did he sign the paper or not?

648
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,900
I couldn't fall asleep
because I was curious.

649
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,500
Is it here?

650
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:47,630
What's this?
Did he actually get this from a girl?

651
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:53,660
<i>How is your health in this cold winter?</i>

652
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:58,350
<i>Thanks to you, Father, I
passed the intern exam.</i>

653
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:02,270
<i>I'll become a good doctor
who helps people in need.</i>

654
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:05,640
<i>Thank you for everything.</i>

655
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,380
<i>From Oh Jin Hee</i>

656
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:08,980
Oh Jin Hee?

657
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:16,790
My baby!

658
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:18,310
Is he going home?

659
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:21,750
Baby, don't get sick, okay?

660
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,890
What a nice picture.
You guys look good together.

661
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:33,040
By the way, you're not
married yet, right?

662
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,550
Why do you ask such a thing?

663
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:38,580
You look too good together
just to be colleagues.

664
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:41,900
It would be nice to have two
doctors in the family, right?

665
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:45,910
By the way, I'm not sure why she was in
such a hurry, but she's done it once...

666
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:48,130
Do you mind?

667
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,100
Being a 'returned single'
is not a flaw these days...

668
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,930
She's pretty nice, no?

669
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:55,460
Of course, of course.

670
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:56,500
<i>Keep quiet.</i>

671
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,030
Stop the nonsense and let's go home.

672
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:00,770
Anyway, thank you.

673
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:02,580
He needs antibiotic
treatment, so make

674
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:04,400
sure to keep the
scheduled appointments.

675
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,640
And if something goes wrong, you can
go to a pediatrician or to the ER.

676
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,540
Yes, I got it!

677
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:12,630
- Oh, music from the CD was good.
- Right?

678
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:16,650
Those are the best songs I selected.

679
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:19,990
- I have musical talent.
- You gave him a CD?

680
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:23,080
Yes. Something happened
before you came.

681
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,180
- Anyway, get home safe.
- Okay.

682
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:27,460
See you at home, Jin Hee.

683
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:30,390
Bye.

684
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:37,970
You'd faint if you
knew who that guy is.

685
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:39,380
Who is he?

686
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,060
Is he really famous?

687
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,660
Secret! I'm not going to tell you!

688
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:48,020
Why? What is it?

689
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,390
We discharged him after
the antibiotic treatment.

690
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:01,330
His blood test result came
out to be close to normal.

691
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:02,800
That's good.

692
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:15,120
Chief... did you open what I gave you?

693
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,390
If you don't like it, I can exchange...

694
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:19,400
No, I don't like it. Take it back.

695
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,210
Pardon?

696
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:25,110
Chief...

697
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:30,560
I think Oh Chang Min
should receive it, not me.

698
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:35,340
What do you mean by that?

699
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:38,760
The one who saved you...
was Oh Chang Min.

700
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:42,490
Pardon?

701
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:46,640
Professor!

702
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:51,500
- Thank you.
- For what?

703
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:56,240
For... taking care of the baby I sent
home thinking that he had a cold.

704
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,530
- Just in words?
- Pardon?

705
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:01,150
Someone gave a gift
of appreciation...

706
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:03,780
When would I be treated
like that by an intern?

707
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:05,930
Who gave someone a gift?

708
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:07,380
Oh Jin Hee.

709
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:11,510
She got Chief a nice, pretty
jacket for her appreciation.

710
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:14,130
I only gave him socks.

711
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:17,320
- Work hard.
- Yes.

712
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,700
- Quit right now and get out.
- Just forgive me this time.

713
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:42,880
You might be upset right now,
but you'll thank me later.

714
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,470
Chief... Thank you!

715
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:10,920
<i>I need to talk to you.
Come to the rooftop.</i>

716
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:32,810
Why? What do you have to say?

717
01:01:35,850 --> 01:01:39,680
Why the heck do you do this?
Why are you doing this?

718
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,010
What is this about?

719
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:42,350
Who are you to lift
me up or put me down?

720
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:44,830
Tell me so that I can understand.

721
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:48,620
Did you save me with your
amazing family background?

722
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:51,840
Why? Did I look that pitiful?

723
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,800
Did I look like I would never
be a doctor without your help?

724
01:01:57,370 --> 01:01:59,390
Why are you doing this to me?

725
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:02,170
So are you getting angry at me?

726
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:05,060
Whatever it took, we
did the same thing...

727
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:07,930
So why did you get into his arms
but you're getting mad at me?

728
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:13,670
Let go of me!

729
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:18,390
Do you know how you look these days?

730
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:21,100
I'm warning you...

731
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,390
Don't ever smile in front of him!

732
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:26,390
Don't ever get into his arms again!

733
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:30,560
Don't make that face I told you
about in front of other bastards!

734
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:58,340
DramaNo1.Com

735
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:06,240
What's going on between
the two of you?

736
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,930
It's not an accident?

737
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:11,490
Why am I thinking of Oh
Chang Min right now?

738
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:13,040
Is your stomach hurting really bad?

739
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:16,040
This is crazy! Crazy!

740
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,000
How does it start in the beginning?

741
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,710
Miss Oh Jin Hee.
Your last name is Oh, just like me.

742
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:23,030
Really?

743
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,460
- Where are we going right now?
- Next door.

744
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,400
Can it be helped with human power?

745
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,820
It's fate.

746
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:33,710
Are you interested in Oh Jin Hee?

747
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:35,200
Yeah, man.

748
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,550
Oh Jin Hee! Jin Hee!
