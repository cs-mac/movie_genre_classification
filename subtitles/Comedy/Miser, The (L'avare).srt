1
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,708
THE MISER

2
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:06,314
What, dear Élise,
you grow sad...

3
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,994
...after having given me such dear
tokens of your love.

4
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,270
I see you sigh in
the midst of my joy.

5
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:15,595
Can you regret having
made me happy?

6
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:18,428
Do you repent of the engagement
which my love has forced from you?

7
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:21,949
No, Valère, I do not regret
what I do for you.

8
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:24,587
I feel carried on
by too delightful a power...

9
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:27,637
...and I do not even wish that things
should be otherwise than they are.

10
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:30,388
Yes, I am anxious
about the consequences.

11
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:32,709
I greatly fear that I love you
more than I should.

12
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,952
What can you fear from the
affection you have shown me?

13
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,514
Alas! A hundred things at a time.

14
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:42,788
The anger of my father the
reproaches of my family...

15
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,597
...the censure of the world...

16
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,273
...and, above all, Valère,
a change in your heart.

17
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,877
I fear that coldness with which your sex repays
the too warm proofs of an innocent love.

18
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:59,837
Do not judge of me by others.

19
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:03,469
Think me capable of everything, Élise,
except of falling short of what I owe to you.

20
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,271
I love you too much for that.

21
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,714
And my love will be as lasting
as my life.

22
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,111
Ah! Valère, all men
say the same thing.

23
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,157
All men are alike in
their words.

24
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,392
Their actions only show the difference
that exists between them.

25
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,431
Then why not wait for actions...

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,909
...if by them alone you can judge
of the truthfulness of my heart?

27
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,437
Do not suffer your anxious fears to
mislead you, and to wrong me.

28
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,350
Do not let an unjust suspicion destroy the
happiness which is to me dearer than life...

29
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,229
...but give me time to show you by a thousand
proofs the sincerity of my affection.

30
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,076
How easily do we allow ourselves to
be persuaded by those we love.

31
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,677
Valère, I feel sure that your heart is
utterly incapable of deceiving me...

32
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,150
...that your love is sincere, and that
you will ever remain faithful to me.

33
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,472
If I grieve, it will only be over
the difficulties of our position.

34
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,869
But why even this fear?

35
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,993
If everybody knew you as I do,
I should not have much to fear.

36
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,113
I find in you enough to
justify all I do for you.

37
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,631
My heart knows all your merit...

38
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,756
...and feels, moreover, bound to you...

39
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,273
...by deep gratitude.

40
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,989
How can I forget that
horrible moment when...

41
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,037
...we met for the
first time?

42
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,599
Your generous courage...

43
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,278
...in risking your own life to save
mine from the fury of the waves.

44
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,031
Your tender care afterwards,
your constant attentions...

45
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,589
...and your ardent love...

46
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,593
...which neither time nor
difficulties can lessen.

47
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,399
For me you neglect your
parents and your country...

48
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,678
...you give up your
own position in life...

49
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,311
...to be a servant of my father.

50
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,160
How can I resist the influence
that all this has over me?

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,228
Is it not enough...

52
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,153
...to justify in my eyes
my engagement to you?

53
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,278
Yet, who knows if it will be enough
to justify it in the eyes of others?

54
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,034
And how can I feel sure that
my motives will be understood?

55
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,033
It is by my love alone
that I trust to deserve you.

56
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,637
As for your scruples, your father himself
justifies you but too much before the world.

57
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,476
And his avarice might authorise
stranger things still.

58
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,674
Forgive me, my dear Élise, for
speaking thus before you...

59
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,592
...but you know that,
no good can be said of him.

60
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,833
However, if I can find my parents,
as I fully hope I shall...

61
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:26,069
...they will soon be
favourable to us.

62
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,194
I am expecting news of
them with great impatience...

63
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,594
...but if none comes I will
go in search of them myself.

64
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,071
Oh no! Do not leave me. Try rather to
ingratiate yourself in my father's favour.

65
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,832
You can see how I set about it...

66
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:39,469
...and the manoeuvres I have had
to use in order to introduce myself...

67
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,351
...into his service.

68
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:48,068
You know what a part
I play to acquire his affection.

69
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,753
I succeed wonderfully well...

70
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,357
...and I feel that to obtain favour with men,
pretend to be of their way of thinking.

71
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,268
Fall in with their maxims, praise their defects,
and applaud all their doings.

72
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,040
One need not fear to overdo it...

73
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,394
...for however gross the
flattery...

74
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:08,552
...the most cunning are easily duped.

75
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,671
There is nothing so
impertinent or ridiculous...

76
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:14,034
...which they will not believe, provided
it be well seasoned with praise.

77
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,713
Honesty suffers, I acknowledge...

78
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:19,916
...but when we have need of men,
we must adapt ourselves to them...

79
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:23,549
...and if we have no other hope of success,
it is not after all the fault of the flatterer...

80
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,438
...but the fault of those
who wish to be flattered.

81
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,948
Why do you not try also
to gain my brother's goodwill...

82
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,587
...in case the servant
should betray our secret?

83
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,987
I am afraid I cannot
humour them both.

84
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:36,835
The temper of the father
is so different from that of the son.

85
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:39,718
Rather try your brother
yourself.

86
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:41,591
Make use of the love
that exists between you...

87
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,715
...to enlist him in our cause.

88
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,870
I leave you, for he's coming.

89
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:52,234
Speak to him, sound him,
and see how far we can trust him.

90
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,038
I fear I shall never have the courage
to speak to him of my secret.

91
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:16,108
I am very glad to find
you alone, sister.

92
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:19,836
I longed to speak to
you and to tell you a secret.

93
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:24,357
I am quite ready to hear you, brother.
What is it you have to tell me?

94
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:29,316
Many things, sister,
summed up in one word...

95
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,318
Love!

96
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,718
You love?

97
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:35,791
Yes, I love.

98
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:39,476
But, before I say more, let me tell you
I know I depend on my father...

99
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,789
...and that the name of son
subjects me to his will...

100
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:45,872
...that it would be wrong to engage
ourselves without his consent...

101
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,475
...that heaven has made him our master
and that it is our duty...

102
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,549
...not to dispose of ourselves
but in accordance to their wish.

103
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:53,517
That their judgment is not biassed by
their being in love themselves...

104
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:56,233
...that they, therefore, judge better
what is good for us...

105
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,551
...that we ought to trust their experience
rather than the passion which blinds us...

106
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:02,596
...and that the rashness of youth
often carries us...

107
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:04,232
...to the very brink
of dangerous abysses.

108
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,718
I know all this, my sister,
and I tell it you...

109
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:08,433
...to spare you the trouble
of saying it to me...

110
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:10,237
...for my love will not let me
listen to anything...

111
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,390
...and I pray you to spare me
your remonstrances.

112
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,436
Have you engaged yourself,
brother, to her you love?

113
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:20,193
No, but I have determined
to do so...

114
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:23,557
...and I beseech you not to bring
orward any reason to dissuade me.

115
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:25,596
Am I such a very strange
person, brother?

116
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:28,393
No, dear sister,
but you do not love.

117
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,556
You know not the sweet power
that love has upon our hearts...

118
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:33,987
...and I dread your wisdom.

119
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:37,276
Alas! my brother, let us
not speak of my wisdom.

120
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,953
There are very few people in this
world who do not lack wisdom and...

121
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:45,398
...if I opened my heart to you, you would
think me less wise than you are yourself.

122
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,311
Ah! would to heaven that
your heart, like mine....

123
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,149
Let us speak of you first,
and tell me whom it is you love.

124
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:57,393
A young girl who has lately come
to live in our neighbourhood...

125
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:01,270
...and who seems made to inspire
love in all those who behold her.

126
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:04,832
Nature, my dear sister,
has made nothing more lovely...

127
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:07,797
...and I felt another man
the moment I saw her.

128
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:10,270
Her name is Marianne...

129
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,107
...and she lives with
a good, kind mother...

130
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,951
...who is almost always ill...

131
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,270
...and for whom the dear girl
shows the greatest affection.

132
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,591
She waits upon her, pities
and comforts her...

133
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:25,353
...with a tenderness that would
touch you to the very soul.

134
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,990
Whatever she undertakes is
done in the most charming way...

135
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:31,673
...and in all her actions
shine a wonderful grace...

136
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,195
...a most winning gentleness,
an adorable modesty, a...

137
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,034
Ah, my sister, how I wish
you had but seen her.

138
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,595
I see many things in what
you tell me, dear brother...

139
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,672
...and it is sufficient for me to know you
love her for me to understand what she is.

140
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,639
I have discovered, without their
knowing it that they...

141
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,588
...are not in good circumstances, and have
barely enough to cover their expenses.

142
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,032
Can you imagine, my sister...

143
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,949
...what happiness it must be to improve
the condition of those we love...

144
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,872
...skilfully to bring about some relief to
the modest wants of a virtuous family?

145
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,351
And think what grief...

146
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,039
...it is for me to find myself
deprived of this great joy...

147
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,234
...through the avarice of a father,
and for it to be impossible for me...

148
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,755
...to give any proof of my
love to her who is all in all to me.

149
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,112
Yes, I understand, dear brother,
what sorrow this must be to you.

150
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,351
It is greater, my sister,
than you can believe.

151
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,153
For is there anything more cruel than
this mean economy to which we are subjected?

152
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,149
This strange penury
in which we are made to pine?

153
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,277
What good is it to have a fortune if it only
comes to us when we are not able to enjoy it.

154
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,469
If now to provide for my daily maintenance
I get into debt on every side.

155
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,669
If both you and I are reduced daily to beg the help of
tradespeople in order to have decent clothes to wear?

156
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,352
I wanted to ask you to help me sound
my father concerning my present feelings...

157
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,039
...and if I find him opposed to them...

158
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:49,508
...I am determined to go and live
elsewhere with this most charming girl...

159
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,035
...and to make the best of
what Providence offers us.

160
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,197
I am trying everywhere
to raise money for this purpose...

161
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,709
...and if your circumstances,
dear sister, are like mine...

162
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,394
...and our father opposes us...

163
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,913
...let us both leave him...

164
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,755
...and free ourselves from the tyranny in which
his hateful avarice has for so long held us.

165
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,750
It is true that every day he gives us more reason
to regret the death of our mother, and that....

166
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,356
I hear his voice. Let us go a little
farther and finish our talk.

167
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,751
We will afterwards join our forces to make a
common attack on his hard and unkind heart.

168
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,512
Get out of here, this moment.

169
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,319
Be gone out of my house...

170
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,354
...you sworn pickpocket, you
veritable gallows' bird.

171
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,917
I never saw anything more wicked
than this cursed old man...

172
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,116
...and I truly believe
that he is possessed with a devil.

173
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,435
What are you muttering
there between your teeth?

174
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,396
Why do you send me away?

175
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,757
You dare to ask me my reasons?
Out with you, before I thrash you.

176
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,269
What have I done to you?

177
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,159
Done this, that I wish you to be off.

178
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,398
My master, your son, gave me
orders to wait for him.

179
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,598
Go and wait for him
in the street, then.

180
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,311
Don't stay here to see what is going on,
and to make your profit of everything.

181
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,869
I won't always have before
me a spy on all my affair...

182
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,793
...a treacherous scamp, whose cursed eyes
watch all my actions...

183
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,317
...covet all I possess, and ferret about in every
corner to see if there is anything to steal.

184
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,390
How do you want me to...

185
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,197
To steal!

186
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,555
Are you a man
likely to be robbed ...

187
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,948
...when you put every possible
thing under lock and key...

188
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,639
...and mount guard day and night?

189
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,758
I will lock up whatever I think fit,
and mount guard when and where I please.

190
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,071
Did you ever see such spies as are set
upon me to take note of everything I do?

191
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,678
I tremble for fear he should
suspect something of my money.

192
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:36,232
Now, aren't you a fellow to give rise to
stories about my having money hid here?

193
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,549
You have some money
hid in your house?

194
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,836
No, scoundrel!
I do not say that.

195
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,069
I am furious!

196
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,711
I only ask if you do not spread
abroad the report that I have some?

197
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,190
What does it matter whether you have
money, since it is all the same to us?

198
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,557
You want to argue, do you?
Get out of the house.

199
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,470
Very well. I am going.

200
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,478
Wait.

201
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,709
Are you carrying anything
away with you?

202
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,029
What can I possibly carry away?

203
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,474
Come here, and let me see.

204
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,638
Show me your hands.
- There they are.

205
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,550
The others.

206
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,153
The others?
- Yes.

207
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,472
There they are.

208
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,913
Have you anything hid
in here?

209
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,559
Look for yourself.

210
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,398
These wide knee-breeches are convenient
receptacles of stolen goods...

211
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,710
...and I wish a pair
of them had been hanged.

212
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,233
How richly such a man
deserves what he fears...

213
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,072
...and what joy it would be
to me to steal some of his.

214
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,231
What?

215
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,270
What is it you talk of stealing?

216
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,955
I say that you feel about everywhere
to see if I have been stealing anything.

217
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,037
And I mean to do so too.

218
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,634
Plague take all misers
and all miserly ways!

219
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,316
Eh? What do you say?

220
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,715
What do I say?

221
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,639
Yes. What is it you say about
misers and miserly ways.

222
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,315
I say plague take all misers
and all miserly ways.

223
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,436
Of whom do you speak?

224
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,029
Of misers.

225
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,993
And who are they, these misers?

226
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,350
Villains and stingy wretches!

227
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,198
But what do you mean by that?

228
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,073
Why do you trouble yourself
so much about what I say?

229
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,679
I trouble myself because
I think it right to do so.

230
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,989
Do you think I am speaking about you?

231
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,596
I think what I think, but I insist you tell
me to whom you speak when you say that.

232
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,512
To whom I speak? I am speaking
to the inside of my hat.

233
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,908
And I will, perhaps, speak to
the outside of your head.

234
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,274
Would you prevent
me from cursing misers?

235
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,789
No, but I will prevent you from
prating. Hold your tongue.

236
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,710
I name nobody.

237
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,199
Another word, and I'll thrash you.

238
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,271
He whom the cap fits,
let him wear it.

239
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,111
Will you be silent?

240
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,548
Yes, much against my will.

241
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,393
Just look, here is one more pocket.
Are you satisfied?

242
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,678
Come, give it up to me...

243
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,359
without all that fuss.

244
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,191
Give you what?

245
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,793
What you have stolen from me.

246
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,189
I have stolen nothing
at all from you.

247
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,315
Are you telling the truth?

248
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:45,190
Yes.

249
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,035
Good-bye, then, and now
you may go to the devil.

250
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,518
That's a nice way
of dismissing anyone.

251
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,955
I leave it to your
conscience, remember!

252
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,472
This rascally valet is a
constant vexation to me...

253
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:09,153
...and I hate the very sight
of the good-for-nothing cripple.

254
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:13,108
It is no small anxiety to keep
by one a large sum of money...

255
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:15,668
...and happy is the man who has all
his cash well invested...

256
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,797
...and who needs not keep by him more
than he wants for his daily expenses.

257
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,872
I am not a little puzzled to find in the
whole of this house a safe hiding-place.

258
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,995
Don't speak to me of your
strong boxes.

259
00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:28,356
I will never trust to them.

260
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:31,909
Why, they are just the very
things thieves set upon.

261
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:36,994
Meanwhile, I hardly know whether
I did right to bury in my garden...

262
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:40,037
...the ten thousand crowns which were
paid to me yesterday.

263
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:45,273
Ten thousand crowns in
gold is a sum sufficiently...

264
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:49,113
Good heavens!
I have betrayed myself.

265
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,397
My warmth has carried me away.
I believe I spoke aloud.

266
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:55,636
What do you want?

267
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,347
Nothing, father.

268
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:01,672
Have you been here long?

269
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:02,988
We have only just come.

270
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:04,558
Did you hear?
- What?

271
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:05,549
There.
- What?

272
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,550
What I was just now saying.
- No.

273
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,873
You did.
- I beg your pardon, father but we did not.

274
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:12,036
I see well enough that you
overheard a few words.

275
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:15,157
I was only talking to myself about
the trouble one has nowadays...

276
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:16,638
...to raise any money.

277
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,587
And I was saying that he is a fortunate man
who has ten thousand crowns in his house.

278
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,274
We were afraid of coming near you,
for fear of intruding.

279
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:26,033
I am very glad to tell you this, so that
you may not misinterpret things...

280
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:29,555
and imagine that I said that it was
I who have ten thousand crowns.

281
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:30,994
We do not wish to
interfere in your affairs.

282
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:34,951
Would that I had them,
these ten thousand crowns.

283
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:36,035
I should not think that...

284
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:38,355
What a capital affair
it would be for me.

285
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,674
There are things...

286
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:41,318
I greatly need them.

287
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:42,150
I fancy that...

288
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,672
It would suit me exceedingly well.

289
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,628
And I should not have to complain,
as I do now, that the times are bad.

290
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:01,675
You have no reason to complain and everyone
knows that you are well enough off.

291
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:04,833
How? I am well enough off!
Those who say it are liars.

292
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:07,638
Nothing can be more false, and they
are scoundrels who spread such reports.

293
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,319
Don't be angry.

294
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:12,272
It is strange that my own children
betray me and become my enemies.

295
00:19:12,439 --> 00:19:14,316
Is it being your enemy to say
that you have wealth?

296
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:15,190
Yes, it is.

297
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:17,430
Such talk and your extravagant
expenses will be the cause...

298
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:19,635
...that some day thieves
will come and cut my throat...

299
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,915
...in the belief
that I am made of gold.

300
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,307
What extravagant expenses
do I indulge in?

301
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:24,594
Is there anything more scandalous...

302
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,108
...than this sumptuous attire with
which you jaunt it about the town?

303
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,514
I was remonstrating
with your sister yesterday...

304
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:30,152
...but you are still worse.

305
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,708
It cries vengeance to heaven and
were we to calculate all you are wearing...

306
00:19:32,879 --> 00:19:35,029
...we should find enough
for a good annuity.

307
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:37,872
I have told you a hundred times,
that your manners displease me...

308
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,394
...you affect the marquis terribly...

309
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,676
...and for you to be always dressed
as you are, you must certainly rob me.

310
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,915
Rob you? And how?

311
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:48,515
Where else could you find money enough
to clothe yourself as you do?

312
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:50,676
I play...

313
00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:52,995
...and as I am very lucky, I spend in
clothes all the money I win.

314
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:55,992
It is very wrong. If you are lucky
at play, you should profit by it...

315
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:58,275
...and place the money you
win at decent interest...

316
00:19:58,439 --> 00:19:59,792
...so that you may
find it again some day.

317
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:02,757
I should like to know, for instance,
what need there is for all these ribbons...

318
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:05,075
...with which you are decked
from head to foot...

319
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:09,710
...and if half a dozen tags are not
sufficient to fasten your breeches.

320
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:14,077
What necessity is there to spend money
upon wigs, when we have hair of our own growth...

321
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:15,991
...which costs nothing?

322
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:21,873
I will lay a wager that, in wigs and ribbons alone,
there are certainly twenty pistoles spent...

323
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:25,998
...and twenty pistoles brings in at least eighteen
livres six sous eight deniers per annum...

324
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,831
...at only eight per cent interest.

325
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:28,676
You are quite right.

326
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:32,356
Enough on this subject.
Let us talk of something else.

327
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:40,191
I believe they are making signs
to one another to pick my pocket.

328
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,518
What do you mean by those signs?

329
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:46,193
We are hesitating as
to who shall speak first...

330
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:48,429
...for we both have
something to tell you.

331
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:51,268
And I also have something to tell you both.

332
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:53,598
We wanted to speak to you...

333
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:55,391
...about marriage, father.

334
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:56,594
The very thing ...

335
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:57,874
I wish to speak to you about.

336
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:58,994
Ah! my father!

337
00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:03,392
What is the meaning of that exclamation? Is it
the word or the thing itself that frightens you?

338
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:08,037
Marriage may frighten us both
according to the way you take it...

339
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:12,511
...and our feelings may perhaps
not coincide with your choice.

340
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,195
A little patience, if you please.
You need not be alarmed.

341
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,712
I know what is good for you both...

342
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:21,191
...and you will have no reason to complain
of anything I intend to do.

343
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,874
To begin at the beginning.

344
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:27,198
Do you know, tell me...

345
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:29,395
...a young person, called Marianne...

346
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:32,352
...who lives not far from here?

347
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:35,714
Yes, father.

348
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,236
And you?

349
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:38,634
I have heard her spoken of.

350
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:41,713
Well, my son,
and how do you like the girl?

351
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:44,078
She is very charming.

352
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:45,075
Her face?

353
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:47,156
Modest and intelligent.

354
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:48,394
Her air and manner?

355
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,753
Perfect, undoubtedly.

356
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:53,235
Do you not think that such a girl
well deserves to be thought of?

357
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:55,069
Yes, father.

358
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:56,638
She would form a very desirable match?

359
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,875
Very desirable.

360
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:00,189
That there is every likelihood of her
making a thrifty and careful wife?

361
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:01,070
Certainly.

362
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,873
And that a husband might
live very happily with her?

363
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,234
I have not the least doubt about it.

364
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:06,874
There is one little difficulty.

365
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:10,435
I am afraid she has not the
fortune we might reasonably expect.

366
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:15,476
Riches are of little importance when one
is sure of marrying a virtuous woman.

367
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,907
I beg your pardon.

368
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:20,355
If we do not find as much
money as we could wish...

369
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,109
...we may make it up in
something else.

370
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:24,189
That follows as a matter of course.

371
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:27,157
I must say that I am very much pleased to
find that you entirely agree with me...

372
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:31,153
...for her modest manner and her
gentleness have won my heart...

373
00:22:32,879 --> 00:22:35,712
...and I have made up my mind to marry her,
provided I find she has some dowry.

374
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:39,236
What?

375
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,196
You are resolved, you say...?

376
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:42,115
To marry Marianne.

377
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,071
Who? You? You?

378
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,270
Yes, I, I, I.

379
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:48,829
What does all this mean?

380
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,554
I feel a sudden dizziness...

381
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:55,317
...and I must withdraw for a while.

382
00:22:57,399 --> 00:23:01,074
It will be nothing. Go quickly into the kitchen
and drink a large glass of cold water.

383
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:04,072
There goes one of your effeminate fops,
with no more stamina than a chicken.

384
00:23:04,239 --> 00:23:06,230
That is what I have resolved
for myself, my daughter.

385
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:10,074
As to your brother, I have thought of a
certain widow, of whom I heard this morning.

386
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:13,715
And you I shall give to Mr. Anselme.

387
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:14,869
To Mr. Anselme?

388
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:15,869
Yes, a staid and prudent man...

389
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:18,354
...who is not above fifty...

390
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:20,430
...and of whose riches
everybody speaks.

391
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:22,516
I have no wish to marry,
father, if you please.

392
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:26,798
And I, my little girl, my darling, I
wish you to marry, if you please.

393
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:28,154
I beg your pardon, my father.

394
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,752
I beg your pardon, my daughter.

395
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:32,189
I am the very humble
servant of Mr. Anselme...

396
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,475
...but, with your leave,
I shall not marry him.

397
00:23:33,639 --> 00:23:37,109
I am your very humble servant, but
you will marry him this very evening.

398
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,593
This evening?
- This evening.

399
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:39,515
It cannot be done, father.

400
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:40,674
It will be done, daughter.

401
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:41,589
No.
- Yes.

402
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:43,073
No, I tell you.
- Yes, I tell you.

403
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:44,468
You will never force
me to do such a thing.

404
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:47,637
I will force you to it.

405
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:49,278
I had rather kill myself
than marry such a man.

406
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:51,111
You will not kill yourself,
and you will marry him.

407
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:54,550
Did ever any one hear a daughter
speak in such a fashion to her father?

408
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:56,755
But did ever anyone see a father marry
his daughter after such a fashion?

409
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:00,514
It is a match against which
nothing can be said.

410
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:03,597
And I know that it will be approved
of by no reasonable person.

411
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,155
There is Valère coming.

412
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,710
Shall we make him
judge in this affair?

413
00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:12,914
Willingly.

414
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:14,068
You will abide by what he says?

415
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:15,911
Yes, whatever he thinks right, I will do.

416
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,512
Agreed.

417
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:19,835
Come here, Valère.

418
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,275
We have chosen you to decide who is
in the right, my daughter or I.

419
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:28,236
It is certainly you, sir.

420
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:29,434
But have you any idea of
what we are talking about?

421
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:31,908
No, but you could not be in the
wrong. You are reason itself.

422
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:35,037
I want to give her to-night, for a husband,
a man as rich as he is good...

423
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:37,633
...and the hussy tells me to my face
that she scorns to take him.

424
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,389
What do you say to that?

425
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:40,674
What I say to it?

426
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:45,357
I say that I am of your opinion,
and that you cannot but be right...

427
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:47,987
...yet, perhaps, she is not
altogether wrong and...

428
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,196
How so? Mr. Anselme is
an excellent match.

429
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,908
He is a nobleman of simple
habits, and extremely well off.

430
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:58,116
He has no children left
from his first marriage.

431
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:00,668
Could she meet with anything
more suitable?

432
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:02,153
It is true.

433
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:05,749
But she might say that
you are going rather fast...

434
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,071
...and that she ought to have
at least a little time to consider...

435
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,629
It is an opportunity I must not
allow to slip through my fingers.

436
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,233
I find an advantage here
which I should not find elsewhere...

437
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:18,072
...and he agrees to
take her without dowry.

438
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:19,675
Without dowry?

439
00:25:19,879 --> 00:25:20,675
Yes.

440
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:25,198
Ah! I have nothing more to say.

441
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,068
A more convincing reason could
not be found, and she must yield to that.

442
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:30,797
It is a considerable saving to me.

443
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:33,467
Undoubtedly, this admits of no contradiction.

444
00:25:33,879 --> 00:25:38,077
It is true that she might represent to
you that marriage is a serious affair...

445
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:40,649
...that the happiness or misery of
a whole life depends on it...

446
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:43,068
...and that an engagement which
is to last till death ...

447
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:45,116
...ought not to be entered into
without great consideration.

448
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,598
Without dowry!

449
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:48,033
You are right.

450
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:49,194
That must of course decide everything.

451
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:52,237
There are people who might tell you that
on such occasions the wishes of a daughter...

452
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:54,469
...are no doubt to be considered...

453
00:25:54,639 --> 00:25:56,948
...and that this great disparity
of age, of disposition...

454
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:59,508
...might be the cause of many an unpleasant
thing in a married life.

455
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,670
Without dowry!

456
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:04,069
It must be granted that
there is no reply to that.

457
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:06,036
Who in the world
could think otherwise?

458
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:07,518
I do not mean to say but
that there are many fathers...

459
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:10,028
...who would set a much higher value
on the happiness of their daughter...

460
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:13,111
...than on the money they may have
to give for their marriage...

461
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:17,551
...and who would try to see in a marriage
that sweet conformity of tastes...

462
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:20,836
...which is a sure pledge of honour,
tranquillity and joy, and that...

463
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:23,349
Without dowry!

464
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:26,756
That is true. Nothing more
can be said. Without dowry.

465
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,796
How can anyone resist
such arguments?

466
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:32,954
I fancy I hear a
dog barking.

467
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:35,155
Is anyone after my money?

468
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:43,149
Surely, Valère, you are not in earnest
when you speak to him in that manner?

469
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:45,992
I do it that I may not vex him,
and the better to secure my ends.

470
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:48,873
To resist him boldly would
simply spoil everything.

471
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:51,952
There are certain people who are only
to be managed by indirect means...

472
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:55,998
...temperaments averse from all
resistance, restive natures...

473
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,992
...who always kick when we would lead
them on the right road of reason...

474
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,195
...and who can only be led by a way opposed
to that by which you wish them to go.

475
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,317
Pretend to comply with his wishes. You
are much more likely to succeed in the end.

476
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:05,912
But this marriage, Valère?

477
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,313
We will find some pretext
for breaking it off.

478
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:09,749
But what pretext can we find if
it is to be concluded tonight?

479
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,190
You must feign some
illness or other.

480
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:14,355
But he will soon discover the truth
if they call in the doctor.

481
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,829
What do doctors know?

482
00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:22,117
You may complain of anything, the doctor will
be at no loss to explain to you what is it.

483
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:25,909
Flight is the last resource we
have left us to avoid all this.

484
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:29,628
If your love, dear
Élise, is as strong as...

485
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,195
Yes, a daughter is
bound to obey her father.

486
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,917
She has no right to inquire what
a husband offered to her is like...

487
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:43,752
...and when the most important question,
"without dowry", presents itself...

488
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,513
...she should accept
anybody that is given her.

489
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,795
That was beautifully said.

490
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:52,435
I beg your pardon, sir, if I carry it too far,
and take upon myself to speak to her as I do.

491
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:55,352
I am delighted, and I wish you to
have her entirely under your control.

492
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,789
I give him all the authority over
you that heaven has given me...

493
00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:02,392
...and I will have you do
all that he tells you.

494
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,515
After that, resist all my
expostulations, if you can.

495
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,477
I will follow her, sir, if you will allow me,
and will continue the lecture I was giving her.

496
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:08,469
Yes, do so. You will oblige me greatly.

497
00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:10,072
She ought to be kept
in with a tight hand.

498
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:12,275
Do not be afraid, I believe
I shall end by convincing her.

499
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:16,273
Do so. I am going to take a stroll in
the town, and I will come back again.

500
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:20,276
Money is more precious than
anything else in the world...

501
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,831
...and you should thank heaven that
you have so worthy a man for a father.

502
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:27,115
When a man offers to marry
a girl without a dowry...

503
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,871
...we ought to look no farther.

504
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,075
Everything is comprised in that,
and "without dowry"...

505
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:35,557
...compensates for want of beauty,
youth, birth, honour, wisdom, and probity.

506
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:38,710
Ah, the honest fellow!

507
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:40,677
He speaks like an oracle.

508
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:44,036
Happy is he who
can secure such a servant!

509
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,649
How now, you rascal!
Where have you been hiding?

510
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:00,309
Did I not give
you orders to...?

511
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:03,198
Yes, sir, and I came here
resolved to wait for you...

512
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:06,590
...but your father,
that most ungracious of men...

513
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:08,317
...drove me into
the street.

514
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,959
How is our affair progressing?

515
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,552
Things are worse than ever for us...

516
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:15,234
...and since I left you, I have discovered
that my own father is my rival.

517
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:16,788
Your father in love?

518
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:20,713
Yes, and I found it difficult to hide
from him what I felt at such a discovery.

519
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,111
He meddling with love! What the
deuce is he thinking of?

520
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:26,429
Is love made for people of
his build?

521
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:29,107
It is to punish me for my sins that
this passion has entered his head.

522
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:31,555
But why do you hide your love from him?

523
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:36,753
That he may not suspect anything, and to
make it more easy for me to stop this marriage.

524
00:29:37,199 --> 00:29:38,393
What answer did you receive?

525
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,599
Sir, those who borrow
are much to be pitied.

526
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:42,669
Then the affair won't come off?

527
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:45,433
Mr. Simon, the broker who
was recommended to us...

528
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,353
...is an active fellow, and says he has
left no stone unturned to help you.

529
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:51,909
He assures me that your looks
alone have won his heart.

530
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:53,432
Shall I have the fifteen thousand
francs which I want?

531
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:58,195
Yes, but under certain trifling conditions,
which you must accept.

532
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:09,917
Of the fifteen thousand francs...

533
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:13,469
...the lender will only be able to
count down twelve thousand.

534
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:15,675
Instead of the remaining
three thousand...

535
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,674
...the borrower will have to take the clothing,
and jewels from the following catalogue...

536
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,719
...and which the said lender has put in all
good faith at the lowest possible figure.

537
00:30:24,879 --> 00:30:25,755
What is the meaning of all that?

538
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,353
I'll go through the catalogue.

539
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:29,554
First:

540
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,638
A fourpost bedstead, with
hangings of Hungary lace...

541
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:37,394
...very elegantly trimmed
with olive-coloured cloth...

542
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:43,118
...and six chairs and a
counterpane to match...

543
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:48,273
...the whole in very good condition,
and lined with soft red and blue shot-silk.

544
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:52,634
What does he want me to do with all this?
- Wait.

545
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,108
Plus:

546
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:59,188
Tapestry hangings representing
the loves of Gombaud and Macée.

547
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:03,235
Plus:

548
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:07,028
A large walnut table with
twelve columns or turned legs...

549
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:11,351
...which draws out at both ends, and is
provided beneath with six stools.

550
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:15,717
I'm furious.
- Have patience.

551
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:16,795
Plus:

552
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:21,834
A Bologna lute with all its strings,
or nearly all

553
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:24,468
Plus:

554
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:28,752
A lizard's skin, three feet and a half in
length, stuffed with hay...

555
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:32,548
...a pleasing curiosity to hang on the ceiling.

556
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:39,437
The whole of the above-mentioned articles
are really worth more than 4500 francs...

557
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,478
...and are reduced to the value of a thousand
crowns through the considerateness of the lender.

558
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:47,234
Let the plague choke him with his
considerateness, the wretch, the cut-throat!

559
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,317
Is he not satisfied with the interest that he must
force me to take all the rubbish he picks up.

560
00:31:57,199 --> 00:31:59,918
I shan't get two hundred
crowns for all that.

561
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,037
Yet I must bring myself
to yield to all his wishes...

562
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:07,629
...for he is in a position to force
me to accept everything...

563
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:10,472
...and he has me, the villain,
with a knife at my throat.

564
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,876
I see you, sir on the high-road followed
by Panurge to ruin himself...

565
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:18,998
...taking money in advance,
buying dear, selling cheap...

566
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:20,751
...and cutting your corn
while it is still grass.

567
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:21,908
What would you have me do?

568
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,271
It is to this that young men are reduced
by the accursed avarice of their fathers...

569
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:28,836
...and people are astonished after that,
that sons long for their death.

570
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,190
Yes, sir, it is a young man
who is greatly in want of money.

571
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:09,070
His affairs force him to find some at any cost,
and he will submit to all your conditions.

572
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,431
But are you sure, Mr. Simon, that
there is no risk to run in this case?

573
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:16,478
And do you know the name, the property,
and the family of him for whom you speak?

574
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,029
No, I cannot tell you
anything for certain...

575
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:22,111
...as it was by mere chance that
I was made acquainted with him.

576
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:25,191
But he will tell you
everything himself.

577
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:30,035
And his servant has assured me that you
will be satisfied when you know who he is.

578
00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:33,188
All I can tell you...

579
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,150
...is that his family is said to be very wealthy,
that he has already lost his mother...

580
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,950
...and that he will pledge you his word...

581
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:45,236
...that his father will die before
eight months are passed.

582
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:48,157
That is something.

583
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:53,313
Charity, Mr. Simon, demands of us to gratify
people whenever we have it in our power.

584
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,032
Evidently.

585
00:34:24,999 --> 00:34:26,637
What does this mean?
Mr. Simon talking...

586
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:27,794
...with your father.

587
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,274
What?
- Your father talking to Simon.

588
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:35,153
What?

589
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:38,509
Ah, you are in good time!
But who told you to come here?

590
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:41,955
This is the gentleman who wants
to borrow the 15000 francs.

591
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:46,237
What, miscreant? Is it you who
abandon yourself to such excesses?

592
00:34:46,439 --> 00:34:49,272
My father, is it you who stoop
to such shameful deeds?

593
00:34:49,479 --> 00:34:51,947
It is you who are ruining yourself by
loans so greatly to be condemned.

594
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,593
So it is you who seek to enrich
yourself by such criminal usury.

595
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:56,869
And you dare, after that,
to show yourself before me?

596
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:59,075
And you dare, after that,
to show yourself to the world?

597
00:34:59,319 --> 00:35:01,469
Are you not ashamed, tell me,
to descend to these wild excesses?

598
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:04,273
...to rush headlong into frightful expenses?

599
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:08,711
...and disgracefully to dissipate the
wealth your parents have amassed.

600
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:12,474
Are you not ashamed of dishonouring
your station by such dealings?

601
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:16,951
Of sacrificing honour to the insatiable
desire of heaping crown upon crown?

602
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,188
And of outdoing the most
infamous devices...

603
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:22,633
...that have ever been invented
by the most notorious usurers?

604
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:25,907
Get out of my sight, you reprobate!

605
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,671
Who is the more criminal in your opinion?

606
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,750
He who buys the money
of which he stands in need...

607
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,591
...or he who obtains, by unfair means,
money for which he has no use?

608
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,712
Begone, I say, and do not
provoke me to anger.

609
00:35:45,399 --> 00:35:47,230
I am not very much
vexed at this adventure.

610
00:35:47,399 --> 00:35:51,438
It will be a lesson to me to keep
a better watch over all his doings.

611
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:10,874
Sir.

612
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:23,077
Wait a moment, I will come back
and speak to you.

613
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,634
Is it you, my poor La Flèche?

614
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:04,318
How is it we meet here?

615
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:07,394
It is you, Frosine, and what
have you come to do here?

616
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,550
What I do everywhere else.

617
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:13,235
Profit as much as I possibly can by the
small talent I possess.

618
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:15,117
Have you, then, any business with
the master of this house?

619
00:37:15,279 --> 00:37:19,750
Yes. I am transacting for him a matter
for which he is sure to give me a reward.

620
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:23,349
From him? You will be 'cute
if you ever get one...

621
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:26,317
...and I warn you that ready money
is very scarce hereabouts.

622
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:29,955
But there are certain services which
wonderfully touch our feelings.

623
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:34,030
Your humble servant, but as yet
you don't know Harpagon.

624
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:36,554
Harpagon is the human being
of all human beings...

625
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:37,947
...the least humane...

626
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:41,111
...the mortal of all mortals
the hardest and closest.

627
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:48,435
There is nothing more dry, more barren,
than his favour and his good grace...

628
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:51,108
...and "give" is a word for which
he has such a strong dislike...

629
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:54,629
...that he never says "I give",
but "I lend, you a good morning".

630
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:59,869
My God, but I know
the art of fleecing men.

631
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,391
I have a secret of touching
their affections...

632
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,238
...by flattering their hearts...

633
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,309
...and of finding out their
weak points.

634
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:13,158
All useless here.

635
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:15,275
I defy you to soften, as far
as money is concerned...

636
00:38:15,479 --> 00:38:16,753
...the man we are speaking of.

637
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:21,470
He loves money better than
reputation, honour, and virtue...

638
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,989
...and the sight of anyone making demands
upon his purse sends him into convulsions

639
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,872
It is like striking him
in a vital place.

640
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,991
It is piercing him to the heart,
it is like tearing out his very bowels.

641
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:31,275
But he is coming. I will go.

642
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:34,314
Well, what is it, Frosine?

643
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,707
My God!

644
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:39,108
How well you look!

645
00:38:40,399 --> 00:38:43,869
You are the very picture of health.

646
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:44,869
Who, I?

647
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:49,630
Never have I seen you looking
more rosy, more hearty.

648
00:38:49,999 --> 00:38:50,988
Are you in earnest?

649
00:38:51,279 --> 00:38:53,190
What?

650
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:59,634
You have never been
so young in your life...

651
00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:05,035
And I know many a man of twenty-five
who looks much older than you do.

652
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:08,038
And yet, Frosine, I have
passed threescore.

653
00:39:08,399 --> 00:39:12,438
Threescore! Well, and what then?

654
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,590
It's the very flower of manhood...

655
00:39:15,399 --> 00:39:18,471
...the threshold of the
prime of life.

656
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:24,555
True, but twenty years less
would do me no harm, I think.

657
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:26,477
Nonsense.

658
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:29,389
You've no need of that...

659
00:39:30,279 --> 00:39:33,191
...and you are of a build to last
out a hundred.

660
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,155
Do you really think so?

661
00:39:35,759 --> 00:39:37,078
Decidedly.

662
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:44,595
Show me your hand.

663
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,230
No, I can't...

664
00:39:51,799 --> 00:39:55,109
My God, what a line of life
there is there.

665
00:39:55,279 --> 00:39:56,075
Where?

666
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:58,389
Don't you see how far this line goes?

667
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:00,197
Well, and what does it mean?

668
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:04,751
Look, look, look...

669
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:25,350
I said a hundred years...

670
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:27,157
...but no, it is one hundred and
twenty I ought to have said..

671
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:29,708
One hundred and twenty,
is it possible?

672
00:40:29,879 --> 00:40:31,312
I tell you they will
have to kill you...

673
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:34,949
...and you will bury your children
and your children's children.

674
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,472
So much the better.

675
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,913
And what news of our affair?

676
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,271
Is there any need to ask?

677
00:41:16,439 --> 00:41:18,999
Did ever anyone see me begin anything
and not succeed in it?

678
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:22,310
I have, especially for matchmaking,
the most wonderful talent.

679
00:41:22,479 --> 00:41:27,189
I could make the Grand Turk
marry the Republic of Venice.

680
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,270
But we had, to be sure, no such difficult
thing to achieve in this matter.

681
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,875
As I know the ladies very well...

682
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:39,908
...I told them
every particular about you.

683
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:43,236
And I acquainted the mother with your
intentions towards Marianne...

684
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:45,993
...since you saw her pass in the street and
enjoy the fresh air out of her window.

685
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:47,069
What did she answer?

686
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:49,594
She received your proposal
with great joy.

687
00:41:49,759 --> 00:41:53,957
And when I told her you wished that her daughter
comes to-night to assist at the marriage contract...

688
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:55,916
...which is to be signed for
your own daughter...

689
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,355
...she assented at once, and entrusted
her to me for the purpose.

690
00:42:00,959 --> 00:42:06,113
But, Frosine, have you spoken to the mother about
the dowry she can give her daughter?

691
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,072
Did you make her understand that
under such circumstances...

692
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:13,511
...she ought to do her utmost
and to make a great sacrifice?

693
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:16,989
One does not marry a girl without her
bringing something with her.

694
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:19,072
What?

695
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:23,994
She is a girl who will bring you a clear
twelve thousand francs a year.

696
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,833
Twelve thousand francs a year?

697
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,393
Yes.

698
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:31,358
To begin with...

699
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:34,472
...she has been nursed and brought up
with the strictest notions of frugality.

700
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:37,756
She is a girl accustomed to live upon
salad, milk and cheese...

701
00:42:37,919 --> 00:42:42,276
...and who consequently will require
neither a well served up table...

702
00:42:42,439 --> 00:42:44,953
...nor all those delicacies
that another woman would want.

703
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:51,356
This is no small matter, and may well
amount to three thousand francs yearly.

704
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:52,754
Besides this...

705
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,916
...she only cares
for simplicity and neatness...

706
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,988
...she will have none of those splendid,
none of that sumptuous furniture...

707
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,628
...and this is worth more than
four thousand francs per annum.

708
00:43:02,799 --> 00:43:03,754
Lastly...

709
00:43:04,399 --> 00:43:06,594
...she has the deepest
aversion to gambling...

710
00:43:06,799 --> 00:43:11,634
...and this is not very common
nowadays among women.

711
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,450
Let us reckon only
a fourth of that sum.

712
00:43:13,879 --> 00:43:14,834
Five thousand francs a year at play...

713
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:17,988
...and four thousand in clothes
and jewels make nine thousand...

714
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:21,833
...and three thousand francs which
we count for food...

715
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:24,513
...does it not make your
twelve thousand francs?

716
00:43:27,319 --> 00:43:31,278
That's not bad, but that calculation
has nothing real in it.

717
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:33,788
Excuse me.

718
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:37,156
Is it nothing real to bring you in
marriage a great sobriety...

719
00:43:37,959 --> 00:43:41,429
...to inherit a great love
for simplicity in dress...

720
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:43,994
...and the acquired property of a
great hatred for gambling?

721
00:43:44,879 --> 00:43:49,907
It is a farce to pretend to make up a dowry
with all the expenses she will not run into.

722
00:43:50,959 --> 00:43:53,348
I could not give a receipt
for what I do not receive...

723
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:56,670
...and I must decidedly get something.

724
00:43:57,519 --> 00:43:59,510
My God.

725
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:04,988
You will get enough...

726
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:09,229
...and they have spoken to me of a
certain country...

727
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:13,551
...where they have some property,
of which you will be master.

728
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:15,034
We shall have to see to that.

729
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:16,075
Frosine...

730
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,117
...there is one more
thing that makes me uneasy.

731
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:22,397
The girl is young, you know...

732
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:25,949
...and young people generally like
those who are young like themselves.

733
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:29,236
I am afraid that a man of my age
may not exactly suit her taste...

734
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:32,789
...and that this may occasion in my
family certain complications...

735
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:34,674
...that would in nowise be pleasant to me.

736
00:44:34,879 --> 00:44:36,790
Oh, how badly you judge her.

737
00:44:36,959 --> 00:44:39,234
This is one more peculiarity of
which I had to speak to you.

738
00:44:39,399 --> 00:44:41,549
She has the greatest detestation
to all young men...

739
00:44:41,759 --> 00:44:44,068
...and only likes old people.

740
00:44:44,999 --> 00:44:45,829
Does she?

741
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:47,518
Yes, she does.

742
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:50,318
I should like you to hear
her talk on that subject.

743
00:44:50,919 --> 00:44:53,752
She cannot bear at all
the sight of a young man...

744
00:44:53,919 --> 00:44:57,309
...and nothing delights her more
than to see a fine old man...

745
00:44:57,479 --> 00:44:59,754
...with a venerable beard.

746
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,600
The oldest are to
her the most charming...

747
00:45:02,879 --> 00:45:05,168
...and I warn you beforehand not to
make yourself any younger than you are.

748
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:07,828
She wishes for one sixty
years old at least.

749
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:10,588
It is not more than six months ago
that on the very eve of being married...

750
00:45:10,759 --> 00:45:12,715
...she suddenly broke off the match...

751
00:45:12,879 --> 00:45:15,439
...on learning that her lover was
only fifty-six years of age...

752
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,988
...and did not put on
spectacles to sign the contract.

753
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:19,996
Only for that?

754
00:45:20,479 --> 00:45:22,629
Yes, she says there is no pleasure
with a man of fifty-six...

755
00:45:22,799 --> 00:45:23,788
...and most of all...

756
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,712
...she has a decided affection
for those who wear spectacles.

757
00:45:25,879 --> 00:45:29,758
Well, this is quite new to me.

758
00:45:29,959 --> 00:45:32,757
No one can imagine how
far she carries this.

759
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:35,997
She has in her room
a few pictures...

760
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,116
...and what do you imagine they are?

761
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,117
An Adonis, a Paris, an Apollo?

762
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:44,953
No, fine
portraits of Saturn...

763
00:45:46,399 --> 00:45:48,117
...of King Priam...

764
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:49,993
...of old Nestor...

765
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:53,356
...and of good father
Anchises on his son's shoulders.

766
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:57,277
That's admirable.
I should never have guessed.

767
00:45:57,439 --> 00:46:01,671
Indeed had I been a woman, I should
never have loved young fellows.

768
00:46:03,799 --> 00:46:05,676
I should think not. Fine trumpery
indeed, these young men.

769
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,795
Fine jackanapes for a woman to hanker after.

770
00:46:07,959 --> 00:46:11,747
I don't understand how it
is that some women dote so on them.

771
00:46:12,439 --> 00:46:13,952
They must be downright idiots.

772
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:16,474
Can any one be in his senses who
thinks youth amiable?

773
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:19,551
Can those coxcombs be men, and can
one get attached to such animals?

774
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:22,153
Exactly what I say every day!
With their effeminate voices...

775
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,549
...their three little bits of a beard
turned up like cat's whiskers...

776
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:28,473
...their tow wigs, their flowing
breeches and open breasts.

777
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,353
Yes, they are famous guys
compared with yourself.

778
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:40,829
In you we see
something like a man.

779
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:43,515
There is enough to satisfy the eye.

780
00:46:43,879 --> 00:46:47,838
It is thus that one should be made
and dressed to inspire love.

781
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:50,351
Then you think I am pretty well?

782
00:46:50,679 --> 00:46:52,715
What?

783
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:56,590
You are charming...

784
00:46:56,759 --> 00:46:59,114
...and your face would
make a beautiful picture.

785
00:47:01,479 --> 00:47:04,357
Turn round a little, if you please.

786
00:47:07,319 --> 00:47:10,038
You could not find anything
better anywhere.

787
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,632
Let me see you walk.

788
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:23,277
You have a well-shaped body...

789
00:47:23,479 --> 00:47:26,915
...free and easy, as it should be...

790
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:30,869
...and one which
gives no sign of infirmity.

791
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:32,797
I have nothing the matter to speak of,
I am thankful to say.

792
00:47:32,959 --> 00:47:37,157
It is only my cough, which
returns from time to time.

793
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:39,234
That is nothing.

794
00:47:39,399 --> 00:47:43,472
And coughing becomes
you exceedingly well.

795
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,594
I have, sir, a small request
to make to you.

796
00:47:52,759 --> 00:47:54,511
I am in danger of losing a lawsuit
for want of a little money.

797
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,879
You cannot imagine how happy
she will be to see you.

798
00:48:04,359 --> 00:48:08,113
Oh! how sure you
are to please her.

799
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:14,517
And how sure that antique ruff of yours
is to produce a wonderful effect on her.

800
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:20,073
Really, sir, this lawsuit is of the utmost
importance for me.

801
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:22,150
If I lose it, I am
for ever ruined.

802
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,753
Sir, sir, please.

803
00:48:24,919 --> 00:48:25,908
No, I can't.

804
00:48:26,359 --> 00:48:30,398
I would not importune you so if I
were not compelled by necessity.

805
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:33,997
Do not refuse me the service, sir.

806
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:39,677
I beg of you. You can hardly
believe, sir, the pleasure that...

807
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:43,555
She will like you!

808
00:48:44,999 --> 00:48:47,069
Sir, sir...

809
00:48:56,399 --> 00:49:00,233
May the fever seize you, you stingy cur,
and send you to the devil.

810
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:05,317
The miser has held out
against all my attacks.

811
00:49:05,999 --> 00:49:08,149
But I must not drop the negotiation...

812
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:12,358
...for I have the other side, and there,
at all events, I am sure of a good reward.

813
00:49:14,399 --> 00:49:15,434
Here, come here, all of you.

814
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:18,074
I must give you orders
for by and by.

815
00:49:18,879 --> 00:49:20,358
Come nearer, Dame Claude.

816
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:22,789
Let us begin with you.

817
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:25,109
You are ready armed, I see.

818
00:49:25,479 --> 00:49:27,788
To you I commit the care of
cleaning up everywhere...

819
00:49:27,959 --> 00:49:31,838
...but be very careful not to rub the furniture
too hard, for fear of wearing it out.

820
00:49:31,999 --> 00:49:33,318
Besides this...

821
00:49:38,959 --> 00:49:42,031
...I put the bottles
under your care during supper...

822
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:45,271
...and if any one of them is missing, or
if anything gets broken...

823
00:49:45,439 --> 00:49:48,351
...you will be responsible for it,
and pay it out of your wages.

824
00:49:49,879 --> 00:49:50,789
Go.

825
00:49:55,279 --> 00:49:57,110
To you, Brindavoine, and
to you, La Merluche...

826
00:49:57,279 --> 00:49:59,270
...belongs the duty of
washing the glasses...

827
00:49:59,439 --> 00:50:00,588
...and of giving to drink...

828
00:50:00,759 --> 00:50:03,193
...but only when
people are thirsty...

829
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:04,474
...and not according to the custom...

830
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:08,911
...of certain impertinent
lackeys, who urge them to drink.

831
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:11,869
Wait until you have been asked
several times...

832
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:15,476
...and remember always
to have plenty of water.

833
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,828
Wine without water
gets into one's head.

834
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:21,948
Be very careful not to
spoil your clothes.

835
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:26,630
You know that one of the fronts of my
doublet is covered with a large stain of oil.

836
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,115
And I, sir, that my breeches
are all torn behind...

837
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,468
...and that,
saving your presence...

838
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:32,628
Peace!

839
00:50:34,279 --> 00:50:35,428
Turn carefully...

840
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,069
...towards the wall,
and always face the company.

841
00:50:42,759 --> 00:50:46,388
And you, always hold your
hat in this fashion.

842
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,914
As for you, my daughter, you will look
after all that is cleared off the table...

843
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:55,350
...and see that nothing is wasted. This
care is very becoming to young girls.

844
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:56,628
Meanwhile get ready to...

845
00:50:56,839 --> 00:50:59,034
...welcome my lady-love, who is coming
this afternoon to pay you a visit...

846
00:50:59,479 --> 00:51:01,332
...and will take you off
to the fair with her.

847
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:02,514
Do you understand what I say?

848
00:51:02,679 --> 00:51:03,395
Yes, father.

849
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:07,592
And you, my son to whom I have the
kindness of forgiving what happened earlier...

850
00:51:07,759 --> 00:51:10,796
...don't receive her coldly.

851
00:51:10,999 --> 00:51:13,672
Receive her coldly!
And why should I?

852
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:16,912
We know pretty well the ways of
children whose fathers marry again...

853
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:19,752
...and the looks they give to
those we call stepmothers.

854
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:23,315
But if you wish me to forget
your last offence...

855
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:26,716
...I advise you, above all
things, to receive her kindly...

856
00:51:26,879 --> 00:51:30,269
...and to give her the
heartiest welcome you can.

857
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:34,155
I cannot promise you that I am very
happy to see her become my stepmother.

858
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,116
I would lie if I said otherwise.

859
00:51:36,265 --> 00:51:39,473
But as to giving her a kind welcome...

860
00:51:39,508 --> 00:51:41,971
...I promise to obey you
in that to the very letter.

861
00:51:42,419 --> 00:51:44,645
Be careful you do, at least.

862
00:51:44,949 --> 00:51:47,171
You will see that you have
no cause to complain.

863
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:49,331
You will do wisely.

864
00:51:54,284 --> 00:51:56,354
Good, everybody, let's go...

865
00:51:57,059 --> 00:51:59,254
Valère, help me with this.

866
00:52:00,259 --> 00:52:04,218
Master Jacques, I kept you for the last.

867
00:52:04,422 --> 00:52:08,461
Is it to your coachman or to your
cook you want to speak?

868
00:52:08,913 --> 00:52:10,216
For I am both.

869
00:52:10,499 --> 00:52:11,375
To both.

870
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:13,732
But to which of the two first?

871
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,015
To the cook.

872
00:52:15,739 --> 00:52:17,297
Then wait a minute, if you please.

873
00:52:21,797 --> 00:52:24,066
What the deuce is the meaning
of this ceremony?

874
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:31,259
Now I am at your service.

875
00:52:31,394 --> 00:52:34,345
I have engaged myself, Master Jacques,
to give a supper to-night.

876
00:52:34,504 --> 00:52:36,075
Wonderful!

877
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:38,482
Tell me, can you give us a good supper?

878
00:52:38,682 --> 00:52:40,584
Yes, if you give me money.

879
00:52:40,784 --> 00:52:42,462
The deuce! Always money!

880
00:52:42,687 --> 00:52:45,411
I think they have nothing else to say
except money, money, money!

881
00:52:44,339 --> 00:52:47,219
Always that same word in their mouth.

882
00:52:47,499 --> 00:52:50,013
They always speak of money!
It's their pillow companion, money!

883
00:52:50,831 --> 00:52:52,504
Never did I hear
such an impertinent answer!

884
00:52:53,492 --> 00:52:54,188
Would you call it
wonderful...

885
00:52:54,388 --> 00:52:56,682
...to provide good cheer
with plenty of money?

886
00:52:56,717 --> 00:52:57,898
Is it not the
easiest thing in the world?

887
00:52:58,339 --> 00:53:00,489
The most stupid could do as much.

888
00:52:59,819 --> 00:53:04,813
But a clever man should talk of
a good supper with little money.

889
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,379
A good supper with little money?

890
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:09,051
Yes.

891
00:53:09,204 --> 00:53:12,654
Indeed, Mr. Steward, you will oblige me
greatly by telling me your secret...

892
00:53:12,854 --> 00:53:14,930
...and also by filling my place as cook...

893
00:53:14,965 --> 00:53:18,884
...for you keep on meddling here,
and want to be everything.

894
00:53:19,084 --> 00:53:21,911
Hold your tongue. What shall we want?

895
00:53:22,111 --> 00:53:25,222
Ask that of Mr. Steward, who will give
you good cheer with little money.

896
00:53:26,817 --> 00:53:28,558
I want you to answer me.

897
00:53:28,758 --> 00:53:30,277
How many will there be at your table?

898
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,954
How many will there be at your table?

899
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,194
Eight or ten, but you must
only reckon for eight.

900
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:38,977
When there is enough for eight,
there is enough for ten.

901
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:40,253
That is evident.

902
00:53:41,059 --> 00:53:42,757
Very well then, you must have
four tureens of soup...

903
00:53:43,332 --> 00:53:44,514
...and five side dishes.

904
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:45,696
Soups.

905
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:46,632
Entrées.

906
00:53:46,789 --> 00:53:50,426
What, do you mean
to feed a whole town?

907
00:53:50,626 --> 00:53:51,568
Roast...

908
00:53:51,768 --> 00:53:54,111
Traitor!

909
00:53:54,259 --> 00:53:55,817
You are eating up all my substance.

910
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:57,498
Entremêts...
- More still?

911
00:53:57,819 --> 00:54:00,049
Do you mean to kill everybody?

912
00:53:59,379 --> 00:54:03,504
And has your master invited people
in order to destroy them with over-feeding?

913
00:54:04,446 --> 00:54:07,274
Go and read a little the precepts of
health, and ask the doctors...

914
00:54:07,474 --> 00:54:10,493
...if there is anything so hurtful
to man as excess in eating.

915
00:54:10,693 --> 00:54:11,596
He is perfectly right.

916
00:54:11,796 --> 00:54:13,879
Know, Master Jacques,
you and people like you...

917
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:16,922
...that a table overloaded with
meat is a real cut-throat...

918
00:54:17,122 --> 00:54:19,411
...that, to be the true
friends of those we invite...

919
00:54:19,611 --> 00:54:22,004
...frugality should reign
throughout the repast we give...

920
00:54:22,204 --> 00:54:24,062
...and that according to the saying
of one of the ancients...

921
00:54:24,262 --> 00:54:27,595
..."We must eat to live,
and not live to eat."

922
00:54:37,647 --> 00:54:40,346
How well the man speaks!

923
00:54:40,381 --> 00:54:43,338
Come near, let me embrace you for
this last saying.

924
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:48,367
The finest sentence that I have
ever heard in my life...

925
00:54:49,104 --> 00:54:52,342
..."We must live to eat, and not eat..."

926
00:54:52,806 --> 00:54:53,823
No, that isn't it.
How do you say it?

927
00:54:54,099 --> 00:54:56,977
That we must eat to live,
and not live to eat.

928
00:54:55,579 --> 00:54:56,409
Do you hear that?

929
00:54:59,499 --> 00:55:01,057
Who is the great man who said that?

930
00:55:01,419 --> 00:55:02,647
I do not exactly recollect
his name just now.

931
00:55:03,179 --> 00:55:04,692
Remember to write down
those words for me.

932
00:55:04,579 --> 00:55:06,570
I will have them engraved
in letters of gold...

933
00:55:06,259 --> 00:55:08,170
...over the mantel-piece
of my dining-room.

934
00:55:08,419 --> 00:55:09,135
I will not fail.

935
00:55:10,499 --> 00:55:13,297
As for your supper, you
had better let me manage it.

936
00:55:11,539 --> 00:55:12,415
Do so.

937
00:55:14,499 --> 00:55:16,888
So much the better.
All the less work for me.

938
00:55:15,539 --> 00:55:20,266
We must have some of those things of
which it is not possible to eat much.

939
00:55:21,474 --> 00:55:24,160
Some good fat beans...

940
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:26,891
...and a pâté well stuffed
with chestnuts.

941
00:55:28,612 --> 00:55:30,662
Something that swells up.

942
00:55:33,752 --> 00:55:36,429
Trust to me.

943
00:55:36,464 --> 00:55:39,336
Now, Master Jacques, you
must clean my carriage.

944
00:55:42,081 --> 00:55:45,858
Wait a moment.
This is to the coachman.

945
00:55:56,389 --> 00:55:58,086
You say?

946
00:55:58,419 --> 00:56:02,652
That you must clean my carriage, and have
my horses ready to drive to the fair.

947
00:56:02,852 --> 00:56:05,018
Your horses, sir?

948
00:56:05,218 --> 00:56:07,814
Your horses, let's see.

949
00:56:09,793 --> 00:56:11,698
They are not at all in a
condition to stir.

950
00:56:11,898 --> 00:56:15,158
I won't tell you that they are laid up, for the
poor things have got nothing to lie upon...

951
00:56:15,654 --> 00:56:17,431
...and it would not be
telling the truth.

952
00:56:17,466 --> 00:56:24,807
But you make them keep such rigid fasts that
they are nothing but phantoms, ideas...

953
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:26,674
...and mere shadows of horses.

954
00:56:26,831 --> 00:56:28,279
They have nothing to do.

955
00:56:28,299 --> 00:56:31,371
And because they have nothing to do,
must they have nothing to eat?

956
00:56:29,699 --> 00:56:34,887
It would be much better for them to
work much and eat to correspond.

957
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:39,071
It breaks my heart to
see them so reduced...

958
00:56:40,082 --> 00:56:42,629
...for I love my horses...

959
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,923
...and when I see them suffer,
it seems as if it were myself.

960
00:56:47,273 --> 00:56:49,238
Every day I take the bread
out of my own mouth...

961
00:56:49,523 --> 00:56:54,114
...and it is being too hard-hearted to
have no compassion upon one's neighbour.

962
00:56:54,187 --> 00:56:55,962
They only must go to the market.

963
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,968
No, sir. I haven't the heart to drive them.

964
00:56:57,579 --> 00:57:01,497
It would go against my conscience to use
the whip to them in the state they are in.

965
00:57:01,697 --> 00:57:06,000
How can they drag a carriage if they have
not even strength to drag themselves along?

966
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,697
Sir.

967
00:57:08,019 --> 00:57:10,801
I will ask our neighbour, Picard,
to drive them...

968
00:57:11,001 --> 00:57:12,813
...particularly as we shall want his
help to get the supper ready.

969
00:57:12,913 --> 00:57:15,561
Be it so. I had much rather they should
die under another's hand than under mine.

970
00:57:15,761 --> 00:57:17,170
Master Jacques is mightily considerate.

971
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:19,122
Mr. Steward is mightily indispensable.

972
00:57:19,222 --> 00:57:20,368
Peace.

973
00:57:20,779 --> 00:57:22,178
No, sir.
- Peace.

974
00:57:21,979 --> 00:57:24,447
No, no.
I can't bear these flatteries.

975
00:57:24,539 --> 00:57:27,472
And I can see that, whatever
this man does...

976
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:31,373
...his continual watching after the bread,
wine, wood, salt, and candles...

977
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:34,508
...is done but to curry favour
and to make his court to you.

978
00:57:35,341 --> 00:57:37,088
I am indignant.

979
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:40,838
And I am sorry to hear every day
what is said of you...

980
00:57:41,038 --> 00:57:46,671
...for, after all, I have a certain
tenderness for you...

981
00:57:46,871 --> 00:57:49,654
...and, except my horses, you are
the person I like most.

982
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,477
And I would know from you, Master Jacques,
what it is that is said of me.

983
00:58:01,663 --> 00:58:06,069
Certainly, sir, if I were sure you
would not get angry with me.

984
00:58:06,198 --> 00:58:08,389
No, no, never fear.

985
00:58:10,913 --> 00:58:13,042
Excuse me, but I am sure
you will be angry.

986
00:58:13,282 --> 00:58:15,698
No, on the contrary, you will oblige me.

987
00:58:15,733 --> 00:58:19,564
I should be glad to know
what people say of me.

988
00:58:32,945 --> 00:58:35,626
Since you wish it, sir...

989
00:58:35,661 --> 00:58:38,735
...I will tell you frankly that you are the
laughing-stock of everybody...

990
00:58:40,168 --> 00:58:42,607
...that they taunt us everywhere by a
thousand jokes on your account...

991
00:58:43,379 --> 00:58:46,883
...and that nothing delights people
more than to make sport of you...

992
00:58:49,248 --> 00:58:52,707
...and to tell stories without
end about your stinginess.

993
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:57,693
One says that you have special
almanacks printed...

994
00:58:58,311 --> 00:59:00,870
...where you double the
ember days and vigils...

995
00:59:01,398 --> 00:59:03,831
...so that you may profit by the
fasts to which you bind all your house.

996
00:59:04,042 --> 00:59:08,485
Another, that you always have a ready-made
quarrel for your servants at Christmas time...

997
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:09,876
...or when they leave you...

998
00:59:10,076 --> 00:59:13,161
...so that you may give them nothing.

999
00:59:13,196 --> 00:59:19,099
One tells a story how not long since
you prosecuted a neighbour's cat...

1000
00:59:19,299 --> 00:59:22,202
...because it had eaten up
the remainder of a leg of mutton.

1001
00:59:24,183 --> 00:59:29,844
Another says that one night you
were caught stealing your horses' oats...

1002
00:59:30,044 --> 00:59:33,132
...and that your coachman, that
is the man who was before me...

1003
00:59:33,332 --> 00:59:38,195
...gave you, in the dark, a good sound
drubbing, of which you said nothing.

1004
00:59:38,851 --> 00:59:40,347
What is the use of going on?

1005
00:59:43,137 --> 00:59:49,030
We can go nowhere but we are
sure to hear you pulled to pieces.

1006
00:59:50,078 --> 00:59:53,685
You are the butt and jest and
byword of everybody...

1007
00:59:53,885 --> 00:59:56,818
...and never does anyone mention
you but under the names of miser...

1008
00:59:57,018 --> 00:59:59,283
...stingy, mean...

1009
00:59:59,483 --> 01:00:02,023
...niggardly fellow and usurer.

1010
01:00:12,021 --> 01:00:17,384
You are a fool, a rascal, a scoundrel,
and an impertinent wretch.

1011
01:00:21,802 --> 01:00:23,256
Did not I know how it would be?

1012
01:00:23,699 --> 01:00:26,576
I told you I should make you
angry if I spoke the truth?

1013
01:00:27,795 --> 01:00:29,525
Learn how to speak.

1014
01:00:34,315 --> 01:00:38,537
Well, Master Jacques, your
frankness is badly rewarded.

1015
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:42,154
Mr. Upstart, you who assume the man
of consequence, it is no business of yours.

1016
01:00:42,493 --> 01:00:45,865
Laugh at your own cudgelling
and don't come here and laugh at mine.

1017
01:00:46,074 --> 01:00:49,208
Master Jacques, don't get into
a passion, I beg of you.

1018
01:00:51,883 --> 01:00:56,409
I will put on a bold face, and if he
is afraid of me, I will pay him back somewhat.

1019
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,397
Do you know, Mr. Grinner...

1020
01:00:59,543 --> 01:01:01,175
...that I am not laughing?

1021
01:01:01,189 --> 01:01:05,478
And that if you provoke me, I shall
make you laugh after another fashion?

1022
01:01:05,765 --> 01:01:06,765
Gently.

1023
01:01:06,766 --> 01:01:09,028
How gently? And if it does not
please me to go gently?

1024
01:01:09,227 --> 01:01:10,350
Come.

1025
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,433
You are an impudent rascal.

1026
01:01:11,633 --> 01:01:12,692
Master Jacques...

1027
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:14,973
None of your Master Jacques here!

1028
01:01:15,146 --> 01:01:18,275
If I take up a stick, I shall
soon make you feel it.

1029
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,027
What do you mean by a stick?

1030
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:22,008
No, I don't say anything about that.

1031
01:01:22,158 --> 01:01:25,732
Do you know, Mr. Conceit, that I am a man
to give you a drubbing in good earnest?

1032
01:01:25,922 --> 01:01:26,809
I have no doubt of it.

1033
01:01:27,009 --> 01:01:29,545
That you are nothing but
a scrub of a cook?

1034
01:01:29,745 --> 01:01:30,850
I know it very well.

1035
01:01:30,999 --> 01:01:32,684
And that you don't know me yet?

1036
01:01:32,884 --> 01:01:33,787
I beg your pardon.

1037
01:01:33,987 --> 01:01:34,926
You will beat me, you say?

1038
01:01:35,126 --> 01:01:36,978
I only spoke in jest.

1039
01:01:37,101 --> 01:01:39,714
I don't like your jesting.

1040
01:01:45,798 --> 01:01:48,406
I spoke in jest.

1041
01:01:51,234 --> 01:01:52,961
You are but a sorry hand at jesting.

1042
01:01:57,099 --> 01:02:00,258
Plague take all sincerity.
It is a bad trade.

1043
01:02:00,388 --> 01:02:02,565
I will cease to tell the truth.

1044
01:02:02,644 --> 01:02:04,876
It is all very well for
my master to beat me.

1045
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:08,222
But as for that Mr. Steward,
I will be revenged on him if I can.

1046
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,305
Do you know if your
master is at home?

1047
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:35,653
Yes, he is indeed.
I know it but too well.

1048
01:02:35,847 --> 01:02:37,089
Tell him, please, that we are here.

1049
01:03:15,863 --> 01:03:18,318
Frosine, how strange I feel.

1050
01:03:18,488 --> 01:03:21,034
And how I dread this interview.

1051
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,492
Why should you?
What can you possibly dread?

1052
01:03:24,692 --> 01:03:26,362
Alas, can you ask me?

1053
01:03:26,988 --> 01:03:31,315
Can you not understand the alarms of seeing the
instrument of torture to which one is to be tied.

1054
01:03:31,515 --> 01:03:36,850
I see very well that Harpagon is
not the torture you would embrace...

1055
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:43,195
...and I can judge that the young man
you spoke of to me is still in your thoughts.

1056
01:03:43,317 --> 01:03:46,165
Frosine, it is a thing I
do not wish to deny.

1057
01:03:46,952 --> 01:03:51,647
The visits he has paid at our house have
left a great impression on my heart.

1058
01:03:51,918 --> 01:03:53,512
But do you know who he is?

1059
01:03:53,919 --> 01:03:55,232
No, I do not.

1060
01:03:55,826 --> 01:03:58,115
All I know is that
he is made to be loved.

1061
01:03:58,281 --> 01:04:00,529
That if things were left
to my choice...

1062
01:04:00,744 --> 01:04:02,650
...I would much rather marry
him than any other...

1063
01:04:03,776 --> 01:04:07,641
...and that he adds to the dread that I have
of the husband they want to force upon me.

1064
01:04:08,088 --> 01:04:12,459
I fully acknowledge that the senses
somewhat clash with the end I propose...

1065
01:04:12,494 --> 01:04:16,250
...and that there are certain inconveniences
to be endured with such a husband...

1066
01:04:16,450 --> 01:04:17,977
...but all that won't last...

1067
01:04:18,177 --> 01:04:22,840
...and his death will soon put you in a
position to take a more pleasant husband...

1068
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,712
...who will make amends for all.

1069
01:04:24,843 --> 01:04:30,229
What a strange state of things that we
must look forward to the death of another.

1070
01:04:31,526 --> 01:04:33,540
Yet death will not fall in
with all the projects we make.

1071
01:04:33,738 --> 01:04:35,075
You are joking.

1072
01:04:36,421 --> 01:04:38,850
You marry him with the understanding
that he will soon leave you a widow.

1073
01:04:38,853 --> 01:04:40,992
It must be one of the articles
of the marriage contract.

1074
01:04:41,615 --> 01:04:43,999
It would be very wrong in him not to
die before three months are over.

1075
01:05:08,759 --> 01:05:12,114
Do not be offended, fair one, if
I come to you with my glasses on.

1076
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:14,489
I know that your beauty
is great enough...

1077
01:05:14,222 --> 01:05:18,385
...to be seen with the naked eye.

1078
01:05:18,585 --> 01:05:22,500
But it is with glasses that
we look at the stars...

1079
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:24,808
...and I maintain and uphold
that you are a star.

1080
01:05:25,003 --> 01:05:28,742
The most beautiful and
in the land of stars.

1081
01:05:30,086 --> 01:05:31,890
Here he is, in person.

1082
01:05:31,974 --> 01:05:33,085
O, Frosine, what a sight.

1083
01:05:39,261 --> 01:05:41,734
She does not answer and
it seems to me...

1084
01:05:41,872 --> 01:05:44,734
...shows no joy at the sight of me.

1085
01:05:45,416 --> 01:05:49,238
It is because she is
still quite awe-struck...

1086
01:05:49,438 --> 01:05:53,701
...and young girls are always afraid
of showing what they feel.

1087
01:05:54,238 --> 01:05:55,667
You are right.

1088
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:04,484
My pretty darling, there is my daughter
coming to welcome you.

1089
01:06:06,821 --> 01:06:08,792
I am very late in acquitting
myself of the visit I owed you.

1090
01:06:09,047 --> 01:06:12,766
You have done what I
ought to have done.

1091
01:06:12,966 --> 01:06:15,876
You see what a great girl she is,
but ill weeds grow apace.

1092
01:06:16,076 --> 01:06:17,281
Oh, what an unpleasant man!

1093
01:06:17,372 --> 01:06:18,130
What does my fair one say?

1094
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:19,825
That she thinks you perfect.

1095
01:06:20,016 --> 01:06:23,079
You do me too much honour,
my adorable darling.

1096
01:06:25,044 --> 01:06:26,361
What a dreadful creature!

1097
01:06:26,743 --> 01:06:29,845
I really feel too grateful to
you for these sentiments.

1098
01:06:31,173 --> 01:06:32,624
I can bear it no longer.

1099
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,659
Here is my son, who also comes
to pay his respects to you.

1100
01:06:39,243 --> 01:06:42,705
Frosine, he is the very one
of whom I spoke to you.

1101
01:06:42,905 --> 01:06:44,865
Well, that is extraordinary.

1102
01:06:45,498 --> 01:06:47,630
You are surprised to see that
my children can be so old...

1103
01:06:46,999 --> 01:06:50,328
...but I shall soon get
rid of both of them.

1104
01:06:50,528 --> 01:06:53,208
Madam, to tell you the truth, I little
expected such an event...

1105
01:06:53,243 --> 01:06:57,114
...and my father surprised me when
he told me to-day of his decision.

1106
01:06:57,314 --> 01:06:58,546
I can say the same thing.

1107
01:06:59,067 --> 01:07:01,843
It is an unexpected meeting...

1108
01:07:01,878 --> 01:07:03,974
...and I certainly was far from
being prepared for such an event.

1109
01:07:04,174 --> 01:07:06,481
Madam, my father cannot
make a better choice...

1110
01:07:06,659 --> 01:07:08,729
...and it is a great joy to me to
welcome you here.

1111
01:07:09,219 --> 01:07:14,452
But I cannot say that I should rejoice if it were
your intention to become my stepmother.

1112
01:07:14,928 --> 01:07:16,256
I must confess that
I should find it...

1113
01:07:16,456 --> 01:07:17,372
...difficult to pay
you the compliment...

1114
01:07:17,572 --> 01:07:19,927
...and it is a title that I
cannot wish you to have.

1115
01:07:20,127 --> 01:07:22,323
To some this speech
would seem coarse...

1116
01:07:22,523 --> 01:07:25,588
...but I feel that
you understand it.

1117
01:07:25,786 --> 01:07:29,701
This marriage, Madam, is
altogether repugnant to me.

1118
01:07:29,736 --> 01:07:32,349
You are not ignorant, now
that you know who I am...

1119
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:33,528
...how opposed it
is to all my own interests...

1120
01:07:33,794 --> 01:07:36,745
...and with my father's permission
I hope you will allow me to say...

1121
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:39,872
...that, if things depended on me,
it would never take place.

1122
01:07:40,179 --> 01:07:44,186
What an impertinent speech to make
and what a confession to make to her!

1123
01:07:44,386 --> 01:07:47,130
And I must tell you that things
are much the same with me...

1124
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:50,105
...and that, if you have any repugnance
in seeing me your stepmother...

1125
01:07:50,305 --> 01:07:52,017
...I shall have no less in
seeing you my stepson.

1126
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:55,817
Do not believe that it is of my own will
that this trouble has come upon you.

1127
01:07:56,419 --> 01:07:58,594
I should be deeply grieved to
cause you the least sorrow...

1128
01:07:59,139 --> 01:08:00,699
...and unless I am forced to it
by a power I must obey...

1129
01:08:00,899 --> 01:08:03,624
...I will never consent to a marriage
which is so painful to you.

1130
01:08:03,772 --> 01:08:06,810
She is right. A foolish speech
deserves a foolish answer.

1131
01:08:07,010 --> 01:08:08,933
I beg your pardon, my love,
for the impertinence of my son.

1132
01:08:09,133 --> 01:08:12,680
He is a silly young fellow, who has not
yet learnt the value of his own words.

1133
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,893
I assure you that he has
not at all offended me.

1134
01:08:16,093 --> 01:08:20,068
I am thankful that he
has spoken so openly.

1135
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:22,274
I care greatly for such
a confession from him.

1136
01:08:22,481 --> 01:08:24,774
If he had spoken differently,
I should feel much less esteem for him.

1137
01:08:25,099 --> 01:08:27,852
It is very kind of you
to excuse him thus.

1138
01:08:27,699 --> 01:08:31,214
Time will make him wiser, and you
will see that his feelings will change.

1139
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:32,757
No, father...

1140
01:08:32,949 --> 01:08:34,316
...they will never change...

1141
01:08:34,669 --> 01:08:36,456
...and I beg of you,
Madam, to believe me.

1142
01:08:36,641 --> 01:08:39,798
Did ever anybody see such folly?
He is becoming worse and worse.

1143
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:41,396
Would you have me false
to my inmost feelings?

1144
01:08:41,734 --> 01:08:45,179
Again! Change your manners,
if you please.

1145
01:08:45,214 --> 01:08:47,648
Very well, since you wish
me to speak differently.

1146
01:08:48,328 --> 01:08:53,320
Allow me, Madam, to take for
a moment my father's place...

1147
01:08:53,355 --> 01:08:57,521
...and forgive me if I tell you I never saw
anybody more charming than you are...

1148
01:08:57,721 --> 01:09:00,046
...that I can understand no happiness
to equal that of pleasing you...

1149
01:09:00,246 --> 01:09:02,333
...and that to be your
husband is a glory...

1150
01:09:02,533 --> 01:09:06,286
...a felicity, I should prefer to
the destinies of the greatest princes.

1151
01:09:06,501 --> 01:09:07,510
Yes, Madame...

1152
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:10,687
...to possess you is to possess
the best of all treasures.

1153
01:09:10,722 --> 01:09:12,097
...to obtain you is all my ambition.

1154
01:09:12,146 --> 01:09:13,920
There is nothing I would not do...

1155
01:09:14,147 --> 01:09:15,513
...for so precious a conquest...

1156
01:09:15,713 --> 01:09:16,985
...and the most powerful obstacles...

1157
01:09:17,185 --> 01:09:20,110
Gently, gently, my son,
if you please.

1158
01:09:21,135 --> 01:09:24,159
These are complimentary words
which I speak to her in your name.

1159
01:09:24,194 --> 01:09:28,488
I have a tongue of my own
to explain my feelings.

1160
01:09:34,096 --> 01:09:35,896
Bring us some chairs.

1161
01:09:38,304 --> 01:09:40,995
No, it is better for us to
go at once to the fair...

1162
01:09:41,195 --> 01:09:44,178
...in order to be back earlier, and
have plenty of time for talking.

1163
01:09:48,077 --> 01:09:50,323
Have the carriage ready at once.

1164
01:09:54,697 --> 01:09:55,971
I hope you will excuse
me, my dear...

1165
01:09:56,117 --> 01:09:59,924
...but I forgot to order refreshments
for you, before you went out.

1166
01:10:00,124 --> 01:10:01,380
I have thought of it, father.

1167
01:10:02,456 --> 01:10:05,399
I have ordered to be brought in
here some baskets of China oranges...

1168
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:09,301
...sweet citrons, and preserves,
which I sent for in your name.

1169
01:10:22,754 --> 01:10:25,032
Valère, Valère!

1170
01:10:31,503 --> 01:10:34,558
You are afraid, father, that
it will not be enough?

1171
01:10:38,598 --> 01:10:40,638
I hope, Madam, that you will
have the kindness to excuse it.

1172
01:10:41,026 --> 01:10:43,501
It was by no means necessary.

1173
01:10:45,751 --> 01:10:50,612
Did you ever see a more brilliant diamond
than the one my father has upon his finger?

1174
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:55,720
You must see it near.

1175
01:10:55,825 --> 01:10:57,013
It is a beautiful one.

1176
01:11:04,081 --> 01:11:05,293
It is very beautiful...

1177
01:11:06,192 --> 01:11:07,761
...and it possesses great lustre.

1178
01:11:08,114 --> 01:11:10,519
No, Madam, it is in hands
too beautiful.

1179
01:11:10,554 --> 01:11:12,564
It is a present my father
gives you.

1180
01:11:13,179 --> 01:11:13,916
I?

1181
01:11:14,124 --> 01:11:16,819
Is it not true, father, that you
wish her to keep it for your sake?

1182
01:11:17,001 --> 01:11:17,802
What?

1183
01:11:18,002 --> 01:11:19,237
He is making me signs that I am
to force you to accept it.

1184
01:11:19,437 --> 01:11:20,126
I would not...

1185
01:11:20,613 --> 01:11:21,450
He would not take it back.

1186
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,812
I am bursting with rage.

1187
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:24,721
It would be...
- No, I tell you, you will offend him.

1188
01:11:24,921 --> 01:11:26,147
Pray...
- By no means.

1189
01:11:26,347 --> 01:11:27,539
Plague take....

1190
01:11:27,739 --> 01:11:29,073
He is perfectly shocked
at your refusal.

1191
01:11:29,273 --> 01:11:29,843
Traitor!

1192
01:11:30,043 --> 01:11:31,194
You see he is in despair.

1193
01:11:31,394 --> 01:11:32,427
You villain!

1194
01:11:32,627 --> 01:11:34,668
Father, I do all I can to persuade
her to accept it.

1195
01:11:34,772 --> 01:11:35,769
Rascal!

1196
01:11:35,969 --> 01:11:37,886
You are the cause, Madam,
of my father scolding me.

1197
01:11:38,073 --> 01:11:39,040
Scoundrel!

1198
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,970
You will make him ill. For goodness'
sake, hesitate no longer.

1199
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:44,875
Keep the ring, since
the gentleman wishes you to.

1200
01:11:46,371 --> 01:11:49,419
I will keep it now, sir,
in order not to make you angry...

1201
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:51,535
...and I shall take another
opportunity of returning it to you.

1202
01:11:55,585 --> 01:11:58,386
Sir, there is a gentleman here
who wants to speak to you.

1203
01:11:58,421 --> 01:12:00,845
Tell him that I cannot see him to-day.

1204
01:12:01,045 --> 01:12:03,729
He says he has some money for you.

1205
01:12:04,285 --> 01:12:06,015
Pray, excuse me,
I will come back directly.

1206
01:12:06,497 --> 01:12:07,628
Monsieur...

1207
01:12:09,384 --> 01:12:11,615
Oh! he has killed me.

1208
01:12:12,017 --> 01:12:14,317
What's the matter, father?
Have you hurt yourself?

1209
01:12:16,406 --> 01:12:17,300
The traitor...

1210
01:12:17,415 --> 01:12:19,220
...must have been bribed
by some of my debtors...

1211
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:20,714
...to break my neck.

1212
01:12:20,943 --> 01:12:21,608
There is nothing serious.

1213
01:12:21,808 --> 01:12:24,884
I beg your pardon, sir, I thought I had
better run fast to tell you.

1214
01:12:24,919 --> 01:12:26,735
What are you here for?

1215
01:12:26,986 --> 01:12:28,799
Your two horses have
lost their shoes.

1216
01:12:29,779 --> 01:12:31,593
Take them quickly to the smith.

1217
01:12:31,628 --> 01:12:35,253
In the meantime I will do the
honours of the house for you...

1218
01:12:35,453 --> 01:12:37,825
...and take this lady into the garden,
where lunch will be brought.

1219
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:39,412
No, not in the garden.

1220
01:12:39,808 --> 01:12:41,391
Very well, father.

1221
01:12:49,427 --> 01:12:50,966
Look after all this...

1222
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:54,903
...and save as much of it as you can...

1223
01:12:55,103 --> 01:12:57,671
...so that we may send it back
to the tradesman again.

1224
01:12:58,229 --> 01:12:59,481
I will.

1225
01:13:09,216 --> 01:13:11,285
Let us come in here.
We shall be much better.

1226
01:13:37,646 --> 01:13:39,439
We can speak openly.

1227
01:13:41,788 --> 01:13:45,277
Yes, Madam, my brother has told me
of the love he has for you.

1228
01:13:45,477 --> 01:13:48,639
I assure you that I have the
greatest sympathy for you.

1229
01:13:48,839 --> 01:13:52,159
I feel it a great comfort in my trouble to
have the sympathy of a person like you...

1230
01:13:52,359 --> 01:13:55,347
...and I entreat you, Madam, ever
to retain for me a friendship...

1231
01:13:55,382 --> 01:13:58,061
...so capable of softening
the cruelty of my fate.

1232
01:14:02,523 --> 01:14:06,544
Frosine, dear Frosine,
will you not help us?

1233
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,095
Indeed, I should like to
do so, as you know.

1234
01:14:09,217 --> 01:14:11,378
I feel but too ready to help...

1235
01:14:11,578 --> 01:14:12,865
...when I see young people
loving each other...

1236
01:14:13,065 --> 01:14:14,714
...in all earnestness and honesty.

1237
01:14:16,053 --> 01:14:18,250
What can we do in this case?

1238
01:14:18,374 --> 01:14:19,644
Try and think a little.

1239
01:14:19,844 --> 01:14:20,882
Advise us.

1240
01:14:21,082 --> 01:14:23,062
Invent something to undo
what you have done.

1241
01:14:23,262 --> 01:14:25,663
Rather a difficult piece of business.

1242
01:14:26,467 --> 01:14:30,095
The most disheartening part of it
all is that your father is your father.

1243
01:14:30,295 --> 01:14:31,184
Yes, so it is.

1244
01:14:31,346 --> 01:14:34,125
I mean that he will bear malice if
he sees that he is refused...

1245
01:14:34,325 --> 01:14:36,852
...and he will be in no way disposed to
give his consent to your marriage.

1246
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:41,062
It would be well if the refusal could
be made to come from him...

1247
01:14:41,262 --> 01:14:43,215
...and you ought to try by
some means or other...

1248
01:14:43,415 --> 01:14:45,186
...to make him dislike you.

1249
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,282
You are quite right.

1250
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,542
Yes, right enough, no doubt.

1251
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:52,516
But how in the world are
we to set about it?

1252
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:55,831
Wait a moment.

1253
01:14:56,535 --> 01:15:00,362
Suppose we had a somewhat
elderly woman...

1254
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,479
...with a little of the ability
which I possess...

1255
01:15:03,634 --> 01:15:05,570
...and able sufficiently well
to represent...

1256
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:06,974
...a lady of rank...

1257
01:15:08,969 --> 01:15:11,680
...of some whimsical title of
a marchioness or viscountess...

1258
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:15,798
...whom we would suppose to
come from Brittany.

1259
01:15:16,072 --> 01:15:17,975
I should have enough power
over your father...

1260
01:15:18,859 --> 01:15:23,091
...to persuade him that she is
a rich woman.

1261
01:15:46,804 --> 01:15:50,007
In possession,
besides her houses...

1262
01:16:02,128 --> 01:16:07,175
...of a hundred thousand
crowns in ready money.

1263
01:16:12,702 --> 01:16:15,178
That she is deeply
in love with him...

1264
01:16:15,371 --> 01:16:19,691
...and that she would marry him at any cost,
were she even to give him all her money...

1265
01:16:19,878 --> 01:16:22,186
...by the marriage contract.

1266
01:17:01,415 --> 01:17:03,755
I have no doubt he would
listen to the proposal.

1267
01:17:03,955 --> 01:17:05,989
For certainly he loves
you very much...

1268
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:08,575
...but he loves
money still better.

1269
01:17:09,179 --> 01:17:13,775
When once he has consented
to your marriage...

1270
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:17,594
...it does not signify much
how he finds out...

1271
01:17:17,794 --> 01:17:19,511
...the true state of affairs
about our marchioness.

1272
01:17:19,711 --> 01:17:21,357
All that is very well made up.

1273
01:17:21,757 --> 01:17:24,742
Depend on my gratitude,
Frosine, if you succeed.

1274
01:17:26,248 --> 01:17:27,422
Leave it to me.

1275
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,482
But, dear Marianne...

1276
01:17:31,682 --> 01:17:34,051
...let us begin by gaining
over your mother...

1277
01:17:34,251 --> 01:17:37,338
...forget not, I beseech you,
those sweet persuasions...

1278
01:17:37,538 --> 01:17:41,467
...those loving caresses to
which nothing could be refused.

1279
01:17:41,667 --> 01:17:44,556
I will do all I can, and
will forget nothing.

1280
01:17:56,050 --> 01:17:59,104
My son is kissing the hand
of his intended stepmother...

1281
01:17:59,139 --> 01:18:02,002
...and his intended stepmother
does not seem much averse to it.

1282
01:18:02,584 --> 01:18:05,707
Can there be any
mystery in all this?

1283
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:08,371
Here comes my father.

1284
01:18:13,882 --> 01:18:16,774
The carriage is quite ready,
and you can start when you like.

1285
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:18,895
Since you are not going,
allow me to take care of them.

1286
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:21,988
No, stop here. They can easily take
care of themselves, and I want you.

1287
01:18:38,921 --> 01:18:43,781
All consideration of stepmother aside,
what do you think of this lady?

1288
01:18:43,981 --> 01:18:45,611
What I think of her?

1289
01:18:45,811 --> 01:18:48,407
Yes, her figure, her beauty
and intelligence?

1290
01:18:49,234 --> 01:18:51,781
So, so.

1291
01:18:51,981 --> 01:18:53,221
What else?

1292
01:18:53,332 --> 01:18:56,937
To tell you the truth, I did
not find her such as I expected.

1293
01:18:58,076 --> 01:19:01,245
Her manner is that of a coquette,
her figure is awkward.

1294
01:19:01,899 --> 01:19:04,070
Her beauty very middling...

1295
01:19:04,297 --> 01:19:05,821
...and her intelligence
of the meanest order.

1296
01:19:05,867 --> 01:19:10,963
I do not mean to make you dislike her.
I like this stepmother as well as any other.

1297
01:19:11,155 --> 01:19:12,422
You spoke to her just now,
nevertheless....

1298
01:19:12,622 --> 01:19:15,683
I paid her several compliments in your
name, but it was to please you.

1299
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,276
So then you don't care for her?

1300
01:19:18,476 --> 01:19:21,086
I? Not in the least.

1301
01:19:21,861 --> 01:19:23,144
I am sorry for it...

1302
01:19:24,366 --> 01:19:26,927
...for that puts an end to a scheme
which had occurred to me.

1303
01:19:27,491 --> 01:19:29,851
Since I have seen her here, I have
been thinking of my own age...

1304
01:19:30,051 --> 01:19:34,062
...and I feel that people would find fault
with me for marrying so young a girl.

1305
01:19:34,262 --> 01:19:36,440
This consideration had made me
determine to abandon the project...

1306
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:41,000
...and as I had demanded her in marriage
and had given her my promise...

1307
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,585
...I would have given her to you if it
were not for the dislike you have for her.

1308
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,327
To me?
- To you.

1309
01:19:45,527 --> 01:19:46,134
In marriage?

1310
01:19:46,334 --> 01:19:47,306
In marriage.

1311
01:19:47,488 --> 01:19:49,826
It is true she is not
at all to my taste...

1312
01:19:50,026 --> 01:19:52,543
...but, to please you, father, I will
bring myself to marry her.

1313
01:19:52,578 --> 01:19:56,029
I am more reasonable than you think.
I don't wish to compel you.

1314
01:19:56,229 --> 01:19:58,583
Excuse me! I will make
an attempt to love her.

1315
01:19:58,783 --> 01:20:01,595
No, no, a marriage cannot be
happy where there is no love.

1316
01:20:01,795 --> 01:20:03,810
That, my father, will,
perhaps, come by and by...

1317
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:05,854
...and it is said that love is
often the fruit of marriage.

1318
01:20:06,054 --> 01:20:08,405
No, it is not right to risk
it on the side of the man.

1319
01:20:08,605 --> 01:20:10,610
If you had felt any
inclination for her...

1320
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:12,870
...you should have married
her instead of me...

1321
01:20:13,070 --> 01:20:16,289
...but as it is, I will return to my
first intention and marry her myself.

1322
01:20:16,359 --> 01:20:19,979
Well, father, since things are so,
I had better be frank with you...

1323
01:20:20,179 --> 01:20:22,334
...and reveal our secret to you.

1324
01:20:22,534 --> 01:20:26,611
The truth is that I have loved her
ever since I saw her one day.

1325
01:20:25,659 --> 01:20:28,949
I intended to ask you
today to let me marry her...

1326
01:20:29,149 --> 01:20:34,017
...and I was only deterred from it
because you spoke of marrying her.

1327
01:20:39,702 --> 01:20:42,439
Have you ever paid her any visits?

1328
01:20:42,539 --> 01:20:43,335
Yes, father.

1329
01:20:43,533 --> 01:20:44,975
Many?

1330
01:20:46,436 --> 01:20:48,133
Yes, considering how long
we have been acquainted.

1331
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:50,699
You were well received?

1332
01:20:50,899 --> 01:20:52,679
Very well, but without
her knowing who I was...

1333
01:20:52,879 --> 01:20:56,114
...and that is why Marianne was
so surprised when she saw me today.

1334
01:20:56,314 --> 01:21:00,597
Have you told her of your love,
and of your intention of marrying her?

1335
01:21:00,797 --> 01:21:04,936
Certainly, and I also spoke a
little to the mother on the subject.

1336
01:21:05,136 --> 01:21:07,992
Did she kindly receive your
proposal for her daughter?

1337
01:21:08,192 --> 01:21:10,063
Yes, very kindly.

1338
01:21:10,263 --> 01:21:14,014
And does the daughter
return your love?

1339
01:21:14,214 --> 01:21:16,896
If I can believe appearances...

1340
01:21:17,619 --> 01:21:19,908
...she is certainly well
disposed towards me.

1341
01:21:20,108 --> 01:21:23,907
I am very glad to have
found out this secret.

1342
01:21:24,179 --> 01:21:26,815
It is the very thing
I wanted to know.

1343
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:28,591
Now, look here, my son,
I tell you what.

1344
01:21:28,754 --> 01:21:31,729
You will have to get rid of
your love for Marianne...

1345
01:21:31,379 --> 01:21:33,097
...to cease to pay your
attentions to a person...

1346
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:38,259
...I intend for myself, and to marry very
soon the wife I have chosen for you.

1347
01:21:42,406 --> 01:21:44,133
So, father, it is thus
you deceive me.

1348
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:46,439
Since things are come
to such a pass...

1349
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:49,697
...I openly declare to you that I shall
not give up my love for Marianne.

1350
01:21:49,732 --> 01:21:53,752
Henceforth there is nothing from which I
shall shrink in order to dispute her with you...

1351
01:21:53,952 --> 01:21:55,763
...and if you have on your side
the consent of the mother...

1352
01:21:55,963 --> 01:21:58,020
...I shall have some other
resources left to aid me.

1353
01:21:58,123 --> 01:22:00,068
You dare to trespass
on my grounds?

1354
01:22:00,268 --> 01:22:03,255
It is you who trespass on mine.
I was the first.

1355
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:05,971
Am I not your father, and
do you not owe me respect?

1356
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:08,668
There are things in which children are not
called upon to pay deference to their fathers...

1357
01:22:08,868 --> 01:22:09,935
...and love is no respector of persons.

1358
01:22:10,135 --> 01:22:12,634
My stick will make you know me better.

1359
01:22:12,834 --> 01:22:14,090
All your threatenings are nothing to me.

1360
01:22:14,298 --> 01:22:16,044
You will give up Marianne?
- Never.

1361
01:22:18,995 --> 01:22:21,186
Gentlemen, what does this mean?

1362
01:22:21,386 --> 01:22:22,131
I don't care a bit for it.

1363
01:22:22,296 --> 01:22:24,151
Such impudence!
- Sir!

1364
01:22:24,477 --> 01:22:25,483
I shall keep to it.

1365
01:22:25,518 --> 01:22:26,759
Let me do it.

1366
01:22:26,959 --> 01:22:28,610
To your son? To me it's different.

1367
01:22:30,743 --> 01:22:34,830
I will make you judge between
us, Master Jacques...

1368
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:36,495
...so that you may see that
I have right on my side.

1369
01:22:36,695 --> 01:22:38,168
I accept.

1370
01:22:52,728 --> 01:22:53,953
Go a little farther back.

1371
01:22:55,259 --> 01:22:57,345
There is a young girl
I love and want to marry...

1372
01:22:57,545 --> 01:23:01,010
...and the scoundrel loves her also,
and wants to marry her in spite of me.

1373
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:02,301
Oh, he is wrong.

1374
01:23:02,501 --> 01:23:05,162
Is it not abominable to see a son who does not
shrink from becoming the rival of his father?

1375
01:23:05,362 --> 01:23:09,276
And is it not his bounden duty
to refrain from interfering with my love?

1376
01:23:09,476 --> 01:23:10,692
You are quite right.

1377
01:23:11,968 --> 01:23:14,417
Let me go and speak to him.

1378
01:23:16,475 --> 01:23:20,053
If he wants to make you a judge
between us, I have no objection...

1379
01:23:20,253 --> 01:23:24,538
...and I don't mind referring
our quarrel to you.

1380
01:23:24,738 --> 01:23:26,803
You do me great honour.

1381
01:23:27,003 --> 01:23:30,253
I am in love with a young girl
who returns my affection...

1382
01:23:30,453 --> 01:23:32,122
...and who receives kindly
the offer of my heart...

1383
01:23:32,322 --> 01:23:36,028
...but my father takes it into his head
to disturb our love by asking her in marriage.

1384
01:23:36,228 --> 01:23:37,724
He certainly is wrong.

1385
01:23:37,924 --> 01:23:40,287
Is it not shameful for a man
of his age to think of marrying?

1386
01:23:40,487 --> 01:23:42,092
I ask you if it is right
for him to fall in love?

1387
01:23:42,292 --> 01:23:44,530
Ought he not now to
leave that to younger men?

1388
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:46,913
You are quite right. Let me speak
a word or two to him.

1389
01:23:49,210 --> 01:23:53,734
Your son is not so extravagant as
you think, and is amenable to reason.

1390
01:23:53,934 --> 01:23:56,309
He says that he is conscious
of the respect he owes you...

1391
01:23:56,509 --> 01:23:59,050
...and that he only got angry
in the heat of the moment.

1392
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:02,198
He will willingly submit
to all you wish...

1393
01:24:02,398 --> 01:24:05,472
...if you will only promise to
treat him more kindly than you do...

1394
01:24:05,672 --> 01:24:09,209
...and will give him in
marriage a person to his taste.

1395
01:24:10,994 --> 01:24:14,758
Tell him that he will obtain everything
from me on those terms...

1396
01:24:14,958 --> 01:24:19,769
...and that, except Marianne,
I leave him free to choose.

1397
01:24:21,236 --> 01:24:22,999
Except Marianne?

1398
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:24,170
Except Marianne.

1399
01:24:24,313 --> 01:24:25,616
Leave that to me.

1400
01:24:27,838 --> 01:24:30,434
Your father is not so unreasonable
as you make him out to me...

1401
01:24:30,634 --> 01:24:33,963
...and he tells me that it is
your violence which irritated him.

1402
01:24:34,163 --> 01:24:39,057
He only objects to your way of doing things,
and is quite ready to grant you all you want...

1403
01:24:39,257 --> 01:24:42,136
...provided you will
use gentle means...

1404
01:24:42,336 --> 01:24:46,993
...and will give him the deference and
respect that a son owes to his father.

1405
01:24:47,193 --> 01:24:50,618
Master Jacques, you can assure him
that if he grants me Marianne...

1406
01:24:50,818 --> 01:24:53,372
...he will always find me the
most submissive of men...

1407
01:24:53,572 --> 01:24:56,659
...and that I shall never do
anything contrary to his pleasure.

1408
01:24:58,581 --> 01:25:00,347
He consents to what you say.

1409
01:25:00,547 --> 01:25:01,677
Nothing could be better.

1410
01:25:03,697 --> 01:25:05,711
He is satisfied with your
promises.

1411
01:25:05,911 --> 01:25:06,985
Heaven be praised!

1412
01:25:08,923 --> 01:25:10,808
Gentlemen, you have nothing to
do but to talk quietly together.

1413
01:25:11,699 --> 01:25:15,278
You are agreed and yet you
were on the point of quarrelling.

1414
01:25:15,478 --> 01:25:18,125
My poor Master Jacques, I shall
be obliged to you all my life.

1415
01:25:18,325 --> 01:25:19,483
Don't mention it.

1416
01:25:19,683 --> 01:25:23,140
You have given me great pleasure
and deserve a reward.

1417
01:25:29,678 --> 01:25:32,641
I will remember it, I promise you.

1418
01:25:32,841 --> 01:25:34,250
I'll kiss your hands.

1419
01:26:08,762 --> 01:26:11,309
I beg your pardon, father,
for having been angry.

1420
01:26:11,509 --> 01:26:13,540
It is nothing.

1421
01:26:16,253 --> 01:26:18,782
I assure you that I feel
very sorry about it.

1422
01:26:18,982 --> 01:26:23,257
I am very happy to see
you reasonable again.

1423
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:25,686
How very kind of you so
soon to forget my fault.

1424
01:26:25,886 --> 01:26:29,650
One easily forgets the faults of children
when they return to their duty.

1425
01:26:30,782 --> 01:26:33,548
What, you are not angry with me
for my extravagant behaviour?

1426
01:26:33,748 --> 01:26:37,598
By your submission and respectful
conduct you compel me to forget my anger.

1427
01:26:37,798 --> 01:26:39,825
I assure you, father...

1428
01:26:39,939 --> 01:26:43,397
...I shall for ever keep in heart the
remembrance of all your kindness.

1429
01:26:43,597 --> 01:26:46,911
And I promise you that, in future,
you will obtain all you like from me.

1430
01:26:49,021 --> 01:26:51,391
I ask nothing more.

1431
01:26:51,591 --> 01:26:53,973
It is sufficient for me that you
give me Marianne.

1432
01:26:54,259 --> 01:26:55,175
What?

1433
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:57,085
I say that I am only
too thankful already...

1434
01:26:57,285 --> 01:27:00,876
...and that when you give me
Marianne, you give me everything.

1435
01:27:01,564 --> 01:27:03,895
Who talks of giving you Marianne?

1436
01:27:04,062 --> 01:27:05,085
You, father.

1437
01:27:05,285 --> 01:27:05,933
I?

1438
01:27:06,033 --> 01:27:06,950
Yes.

1439
01:27:07,150 --> 01:27:08,619
Is it not you who promised
to give her up?

1440
01:27:08,819 --> 01:27:10,183
I, give her up?
- Yes.

1441
01:27:10,383 --> 01:27:11,004
Certainly not.

1442
01:27:11,204 --> 01:27:12,533
Did you not give up all
pretensions to her?

1443
01:27:12,733 --> 01:27:14,922
On the contrary.

1444
01:27:15,122 --> 01:27:17,301
What, scoundrel! Again?

1445
01:27:17,501 --> 01:27:18,654
Nothing can make me
change my mind.

1446
01:27:18,854 --> 01:27:20,185
Let me get at you again, wretch!

1447
01:27:20,385 --> 01:27:22,810
You can do as you please.
- I forbid you ever to come within my sight.

1448
01:27:23,010 --> 01:27:23,724
As you like.

1449
01:27:23,924 --> 01:27:24,767
I abandon you.

1450
01:27:24,967 --> 01:27:25,690
Abandon me.

1451
01:27:25,890 --> 01:27:28,488
I disown you.
- Disown me.

1452
01:27:28,688 --> 01:27:29,470
I disinherit you.

1453
01:27:29,670 --> 01:27:30,711
As you will.

1454
01:27:30,911 --> 01:27:33,341
I give you my curse.

1455
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:35,286
I want none of your gifts.

1456
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:05,311
Sir, you are just in the nick
of time. Quick, follow me.

1457
01:28:05,511 --> 01:28:07,118
What is the matter?
- Follow me, I say.

1458
01:28:07,318 --> 01:28:08,103
How?

1459
01:28:13,732 --> 01:28:15,065
Here is all you want.

1460
01:28:15,265 --> 01:28:16,823
I have watched for this all day.

1461
01:28:17,023 --> 01:28:19,276
What is it?
- Your father's treasure.

1462
01:28:19,476 --> 01:28:20,710
How did you manage it?
- I will tell you all about it.

1463
01:28:20,910 --> 01:28:22,012
Thieves!

1464
01:28:22,212 --> 01:28:23,590
Let us be off. I can hear him
calling out.

1465
01:28:24,084 --> 01:28:26,308
Thieves! Assassins!

1466
01:28:26,508 --> 01:28:28,612
Justice, just heavens!

1467
01:28:28,812 --> 01:28:31,106
I am undone, I am murdered.

1468
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:33,863
They have cut my throat,
they have stolen my money.

1469
01:28:34,063 --> 01:28:36,345
Who can it be?
What has become of him?

1470
01:28:36,539 --> 01:28:39,305
Where is he? Where is he
hiding himself?

1471
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:42,473
What shall I do to find him?
Where shall I run?

1472
01:28:42,673 --> 01:28:44,364
Where shall I not run?

1473
01:28:44,422 --> 01:28:46,018
Is he not here?

1474
01:28:47,927 --> 01:28:49,845
Is he not here?

1475
01:28:53,788 --> 01:28:58,557
Who is this? Stop!
Give me back my money, wretch!

1476
01:28:58,757 --> 01:29:00,157
Ah...! it is myself.

1477
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:05,520
My mind is wandering, and I know not
where I am, who I am, and what I am doing.

1478
01:29:05,802 --> 01:29:08,161
My poor money...

1479
01:29:08,619 --> 01:29:11,478
My poor money...

1480
01:29:12,770 --> 01:29:15,879
My dearest friend, they have
bereaved me of thee...

1481
01:29:16,079 --> 01:29:18,559
...and since thou art
gone, I have lost my support...

1482
01:29:18,759 --> 01:29:21,132
...my consolation, and my joy.

1483
01:29:21,344 --> 01:29:23,273
I have nothing more
to do in the world.

1484
01:29:23,473 --> 01:29:26,405
Without thee it is
impossible for me to live.

1485
01:29:26,605 --> 01:29:29,786
I can bear it no longer.

1486
01:29:30,796 --> 01:29:32,455
I am dying...

1487
01:29:32,655 --> 01:29:36,088
I am dead, I am buried.

1488
01:29:37,778 --> 01:29:41,910
Is there nobody who will call me from the dead,
by restoring my dear money to me...

1489
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:43,566
...or by telling
me who has taken it?

1490
01:29:43,766 --> 01:29:46,685
What is it you say? It is no one.

1491
01:30:09,144 --> 01:30:11,303
Whoever has
committed the deed...

1492
01:30:11,503 --> 01:30:13,778
...must have watched carefully
for his opportunity...

1493
01:30:13,978 --> 01:30:18,055
...and must have chosen the moment when
I was talking with my miscreant of a son.

1494
01:30:18,255 --> 01:30:22,222
I must go. I will demand justice, and have the
whole of my house put to the torture...

1495
01:30:22,422 --> 01:30:25,761
...my maids and my valets, my son,
my daughter, and myself too.

1496
01:30:26,715 --> 01:30:31,548
I see no one who does not rouse
suspicion in me.

1497
01:30:31,583 --> 01:30:33,483
Everyone seems to be my thief.

1498
01:30:33,683 --> 01:30:37,579
What are they speaking of there?
Of him who stole my money?

1499
01:30:37,779 --> 01:30:40,630
What noise is that up yonder?
Is it my thief?

1500
01:30:41,059 --> 01:30:45,858
If you know anything of my thief,
I beseech you to tell me.

1501
01:30:47,153 --> 01:30:49,649
Is he hiding there among you?

1502
01:30:53,427 --> 01:30:55,642
They all look at me and laugh.

1503
01:30:55,842 --> 01:30:58,719
We shall see that they all
have a share in the robbery.

1504
01:30:58,919 --> 01:31:01,720
Quick! magistrates,
police, provosts...

1505
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:05,358
...judges, racks, gibbets, and
executioners.

1506
01:31:05,558 --> 01:31:07,171
I will hang everybody...

1507
01:31:07,371 --> 01:31:11,482
And if I do not find my money, I
will hang myself afterwards.

1508
01:31:11,692 --> 01:31:13,387
Enough!

1509
01:31:16,325 --> 01:31:19,026
Leave that to me.
I know my business.

1510
01:31:19,226 --> 01:31:21,518
This is not the first time I have been
employed in finding out thieves...

1511
01:31:21,718 --> 01:31:25,928
...and I wish I had as many bags of a
thousand francs as I have had people hanged.

1512
01:31:25,963 --> 01:31:29,767
Every magistrate must
take this affair in hand...

1513
01:31:29,967 --> 01:31:32,717
...and if my money
is not found...

1514
01:31:32,917 --> 01:31:36,676
...I shall call justice
against justice itself.

1515
01:31:38,491 --> 01:31:41,557
We must take all needful steps.

1516
01:31:41,757 --> 01:31:43,267
You say there was
in that casket?

1517
01:31:43,467 --> 01:31:45,308
Ten thousand crowns in cash.

1518
01:31:45,508 --> 01:31:46,355
Ten thousand crowns?

1519
01:31:46,555 --> 01:31:48,069
Ten thousand crowns.

1520
01:31:48,269 --> 01:31:54,016
There is no punishment great enough
for the enormity of the crime...

1521
01:31:54,216 --> 01:31:58,982
...and if it remain unpunished, the most
sacred things are no longer secure.

1522
01:31:59,182 --> 01:32:01,252
In what coins was that sum?

1523
01:32:01,651 --> 01:32:06,134
In good louis d'or and
pistoles of full weight.

1524
01:32:08,637 --> 01:32:10,112
Whom do you suspect
of this robbery?

1525
01:32:10,312 --> 01:32:11,277
Everybody.

1526
01:32:11,477 --> 01:32:14,453
I wish you to take into custody
the whole town and suburbs.

1527
01:32:14,653 --> 01:32:16,787
You must not, if you trust
me, frighten anybody...

1528
01:32:16,987 --> 01:32:18,841
...but must use gentle means
to collect evidence...

1529
01:32:19,041 --> 01:32:23,479
...in order afterwards to proceed with
more rigour for the recovery of the sum.

1530
01:32:25,076 --> 01:32:28,456
I am coming back.
Have his throat cut at once...

1531
01:32:28,656 --> 01:32:30,874
...have his feet singed...

1532
01:32:31,074 --> 01:32:32,858
...put him in boiling water...

1533
01:32:33,058 --> 01:32:34,435
...and hang him up to the ceiling.

1534
01:32:34,635 --> 01:32:36,504
What! Him who has robbed me?

1535
01:32:36,704 --> 01:32:38,990
I was speaking of a sucking pig...

1536
01:32:39,190 --> 01:32:41,204
...that your steward
has just sent me.

1537
01:32:41,404 --> 01:32:44,405
This is no longer the question... and you have
to speak of something else to this gentleman.

1538
01:32:44,605 --> 01:32:45,911
Don't get frightened.

1539
01:32:46,481 --> 01:32:50,048
I am not a man to cause any scandal,
and matters will be carried on by gentle means.

1540
01:32:50,248 --> 01:32:51,172
Is this gentleman coming
to supper with you?

1541
01:32:51,372 --> 01:32:54,041
You must, in this case, my good man,
hide nothing from your master.

1542
01:32:54,241 --> 01:32:56,409
Sir, I will show you all I know...

1543
01:32:56,609 --> 01:32:58,053
...and will treat you in
the best manner I possibly can.

1544
01:32:58,253 --> 01:33:01,401
That's not the question.

1545
01:33:01,601 --> 01:33:03,785
If I do not give as good
fare as I should like...

1546
01:33:03,985 --> 01:33:08,010
...it is the fault of your steward, who
has clipped my wings with his economy.

1547
01:33:08,210 --> 01:33:11,110
Rascal! We have other matters
to talk about than supper...

1548
01:33:11,310 --> 01:33:15,641
...and I want you to tell me what has become
of the money which has been stolen from me.

1549
01:33:15,825 --> 01:33:16,522
Some money has been stolen from you?

1550
01:33:16,722 --> 01:33:17,621
Yes.

1551
01:33:17,821 --> 01:33:21,485
And I'll have you hanged if you
don't give it me back again.

1552
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:26,451
Don't be hard upon him.

1553
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:30,749
I see by his looks that
he is an honest fellow...

1554
01:33:30,949 --> 01:33:33,581
...and that he will tell you
all you want to know...

1555
01:33:33,781 --> 01:33:36,279
...without going to prison.

1556
01:33:36,479 --> 01:33:38,109
Yes, my friend...

1557
01:33:38,309 --> 01:33:40,552
...if you confess, no harm
shall come to you...

1558
01:33:40,752 --> 01:33:43,611
...and you shall be well
rewarded by your master.

1559
01:33:44,135 --> 01:33:46,675
Some money has been
stolen from him...

1560
01:33:47,258 --> 01:33:50,961
...and it is not possible
that you know nothing about it.

1561
01:33:54,658 --> 01:33:57,799
The very thing I wanted in order
to be revenged of our steward.

1562
01:33:57,999 --> 01:34:00,420
Ever since he came here,
he has been the favourite.

1563
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:02,881
His advice is the only
one listened to.

1564
01:34:03,168 --> 01:34:05,905
Moreover, I have forgotten
neither the cudgelling of to-day nor...

1565
01:34:06,105 --> 01:34:07,362
What are you muttering
about there?

1566
01:34:07,562 --> 01:34:09,584
Leave him alone. He is preparing
himself to satisfy you.

1567
01:34:09,784 --> 01:34:11,621
I told you that he was an honest fellow.

1568
01:34:11,821 --> 01:34:12,638
Sir...

1569
01:34:12,838 --> 01:34:15,470
...since you want me to
tell you what I know...

1570
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:18,497
...I believe it is your
steward who has done this.

1571
01:34:18,697 --> 01:34:19,820
Valère?

1572
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:21,342
Yes.

1573
01:34:21,542 --> 01:34:23,630
He who seemed so faithful to me!

1574
01:34:23,830 --> 01:34:28,060
Himself. I believe that it is
he who has robbed you.

1575
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:29,744
And what makes you believe it?

1576
01:34:29,944 --> 01:34:31,918
What makes me believe it?
- Yes.

1577
01:34:32,118 --> 01:34:34,780
I believe it... because I believe it.

1578
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:37,510
But you must tell us
the proofs you have.

1579
01:34:37,710 --> 01:34:39,828
Did you see him hanging about
the place where I had put my money?

1580
01:34:40,028 --> 01:34:42,345
Yes, indeed.
Where was your money?

1581
01:34:42,545 --> 01:34:44,418
In the garden.
- Yes, I saw him in the garden.

1582
01:34:45,977 --> 01:34:48,765
And in what was
your money? A casket?

1583
01:34:48,965 --> 01:34:50,642
The very thing.
I saw him with a casket.

1584
01:34:52,507 --> 01:34:54,920
And this casket, what was it like?
I shall soon see if it is mine.

1585
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:56,794
What it was like?
- Yes.

1586
01:34:56,994 --> 01:34:59,163
It was like... like a casket.

1587
01:34:59,363 --> 01:35:01,843
Of course. But describe it a little,
to see if it is the same.

1588
01:35:02,043 --> 01:35:04,056
It was a large casket.

1589
01:35:04,256 --> 01:35:06,078
The one taken from
me is a small one.

1590
01:35:06,278 --> 01:35:08,972
Yes, small if you look
at it in that way...

1591
01:35:09,172 --> 01:35:10,709
...but I call it large
because of what it contains.

1592
01:35:10,909 --> 01:35:12,325
And what colour was it?

1593
01:35:13,103 --> 01:35:14,635
What colour?
- Yes.

1594
01:35:15,305 --> 01:35:17,382
Of a colour...

1595
01:35:17,582 --> 01:35:20,734
...of a certain colour.... Can't you
help me to find the word?

1596
01:35:20,934 --> 01:35:21,826
No.

1597
01:35:23,603 --> 01:35:24,701
Red, isn't it?

1598
01:35:24,901 --> 01:35:26,456
No, grey.

1599
01:35:26,656 --> 01:35:28,726
Yes, reddish-grey.
That's what I meant.

1600
01:35:28,926 --> 01:35:31,134
There is no doubt about it,
it's my casket for certain.

1601
01:35:31,334 --> 01:35:34,705
Write down his evidence, sir!

1602
01:35:34,905 --> 01:35:38,475
Heavens! whom can
we trust after that?

1603
01:35:38,675 --> 01:35:39,860
We must never swear
to anything...

1604
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:44,770
I believe now that I
might rob my own self.

1605
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:54,540
There he is coming back. I beg of you
not to tell him that it was I who let it all out.

1606
01:36:01,168 --> 01:36:03,077
Come near.

1607
01:36:07,963 --> 01:36:10,658
Confess the most abominable action.

1608
01:36:10,739 --> 01:36:14,254
The most horrible crime,
that was ever committed.

1609
01:36:19,893 --> 01:36:20,906
What do you want, sir?

1610
01:36:21,106 --> 01:36:23,702
Wretch! you do not blush for
shame after such a crime?

1611
01:36:25,529 --> 01:36:26,974
Of what crime do you speak?

1612
01:36:27,174 --> 01:36:29,816
Of what crime I speak?
Villain, as if you did not know.

1613
01:36:30,016 --> 01:36:32,033
It is in vain for you
to try to hide it.

1614
01:36:32,233 --> 01:36:34,011
The thing is discovered.

1615
01:36:34,211 --> 01:36:36,616
How could you
thus abuse my kindness.

1616
01:36:36,816 --> 01:36:40,550
Introduce yourself on purpose into
my house to betray me.

1617
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:46,790
Since everything is known to you, I will
neither deny nor will I find excuses.

1618
01:36:46,990 --> 01:36:50,407
Have I guessed the truth?

1619
01:36:52,227 --> 01:36:54,010
I intended to speak
to you about it...

1620
01:36:54,210 --> 01:36:56,931
...and I was watching for a
favourable opportunity.

1621
01:36:57,131 --> 01:37:01,017
But, as this is no longer possible,
I beg of you to hear my motives.

1622
01:37:01,217 --> 01:37:04,215
And what fine motives can
you possibly give me?

1623
01:37:07,749 --> 01:37:09,641
I do not deserve these names.

1624
01:37:09,841 --> 01:37:13,081
I am guilty towards you,
but my fault is pardonable.

1625
01:37:13,281 --> 01:37:16,114
How pardonable?
Such an assassination as this!

1626
01:37:16,314 --> 01:37:18,119
I beseech you not to
be so angry with me.

1627
01:37:18,319 --> 01:37:20,338
You will see that the harm is not
so great as you make it out to be.

1628
01:37:20,538 --> 01:37:24,993
The harm not so great as I make it out
to be. What, my heart's blood, scoundrel!

1629
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:28,784
Your blood, sir, has not
fallen into bad hands.

1630
01:37:28,984 --> 01:37:31,434
My rank is high
enough not to disgrace it...

1631
01:37:31,634 --> 01:37:33,742
...and there is nothing in all this for which
reparation cannot be made.

1632
01:37:33,942 --> 01:37:36,614
It is, indeed, my intention that you should
restore what you have taken from me.

1633
01:37:36,814 --> 01:37:38,919
Your honour, sir,
shall be fully satisfied.

1634
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:42,751
Honour is not the question in all this.
Tell me what made you commit this deed?

1635
01:37:42,951 --> 01:37:44,092
Do you ask it?

1636
01:37:44,292 --> 01:37:45,574
Yes, I should rather think that I do.

1637
01:37:45,774 --> 01:37:50,565
A god who carries with him his excuses
for all he makes people do: Love.

1638
01:37:51,477 --> 01:37:52,682
Love?

1639
01:37:52,882 --> 01:37:54,218
Yes.

1640
01:37:54,418 --> 01:37:57,999
Fine love that! Fine love, indeed.
the love of my gold.

1641
01:37:58,199 --> 01:37:59,232
No, sir.

1642
01:38:08,276 --> 01:38:11,286
It is not your wealth
that has tempted me.

1643
01:38:11,486 --> 01:38:15,066
I swear never to pretend to any of your
possessions, provided you leave me what I have.

1644
01:38:15,266 --> 01:38:17,503
In the name of all the devils,
no, I shall not leave it to you.

1645
01:38:17,703 --> 01:38:20,316
Such villainy! He wishes to keep
what he has robbed me of.

1646
01:38:20,516 --> 01:38:21,794
Do you call that a robbery?

1647
01:38:21,994 --> 01:38:24,192
If I call that a robbery?
A treasure like that!

1648
01:38:24,392 --> 01:38:28,280
I acknowledge that it is a treasure,
and the most precious one you have...

1649
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,685
...but it will not be losing
it to leave it to me.

1650
01:38:30,885 --> 01:38:33,325
I ask you on my knees for this
treasure so full of charms...

1651
01:38:33,525 --> 01:38:34,886
...and if you do right,
you will grant it to me.

1652
01:38:35,086 --> 01:38:37,434
I will do nothing of the kind.
What in the world are you driving at?

1653
01:38:37,634 --> 01:38:39,912
We have pledged our faith to each other,
and have taken an oath.

1654
01:38:40,112 --> 01:38:42,585
The oath is admirable, and the
promise strange enough.

1655
01:38:42,785 --> 01:38:45,590
Yes, we are engaged
to each other for ever.

1656
01:38:45,790 --> 01:38:47,970
I know well how to disengage you,
I assure you of that.

1657
01:38:48,170 --> 01:38:49,635
Nothing but death can separate us.

1658
01:38:49,835 --> 01:38:53,337
You must be devilishly
bewitched by my money.

1659
01:38:53,537 --> 01:38:54,345
I have told you already, sir...

1660
01:38:54,545 --> 01:38:56,499
...that it is not self-interest
which has prompted me.

1661
01:38:56,699 --> 01:38:58,978
It was not that which
prompted my heart...

1662
01:38:59,178 --> 01:39:01,092
...a nobler motive inspired me.

1663
01:39:01,292 --> 01:39:05,929
We shall hear presently that
it is out of Christian charity.

1664
01:39:11,780 --> 01:39:15,931
But justice, impudent rascal,
will soon give me satisfaction.

1665
01:39:16,131 --> 01:39:19,397
You will do as you please, and I
am ready to suffer all your violence...

1666
01:39:19,597 --> 01:39:22,989
...but I beg of you to believe that if there
is any harm done, I am the only one guilty...

1667
01:39:23,189 --> 01:39:25,034
...and that your daughter has
done nothing wrong in all this.

1668
01:39:25,234 --> 01:39:26,250
I should think not.

1669
01:39:26,450 --> 01:39:28,946
It would be strange, indeed, if my
daughter had a share in this crime.

1670
01:39:29,146 --> 01:39:30,876
But I will have that treasure back again...

1671
01:39:31,076 --> 01:39:34,112
...and you must confess to what
place you have carried off what you stole.

1672
01:39:34,312 --> 01:39:36,103
I have not carried it off,
and it is still in your house.

1673
01:39:36,303 --> 01:39:39,726
O my beloved casket!
My treasure has not left my house?

1674
01:39:39,926 --> 01:39:40,915
No, sir.

1675
01:39:42,216 --> 01:39:44,852
Then, tell me, have you taken
any liberties with...?

1676
01:39:48,016 --> 01:39:49,624
Liberties?

1677
01:39:49,918 --> 01:39:51,894
You wrong us both.

1678
01:39:52,094 --> 01:39:55,507
The flame with which I burn is too
pure, too full of respect.

1679
01:39:55,707 --> 01:39:56,983
He burns for my casket.

1680
01:39:57,183 --> 01:40:00,102
I had rather die than show the
least offensive thought.

1681
01:40:00,302 --> 01:40:01,780
I found too much modesty for that.

1682
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:03,277
My cash-box modest.

1683
01:40:03,477 --> 01:40:05,789
All my desires were limited
to the pleasures of sight...

1684
01:40:05,989 --> 01:40:08,695
...and nothing criminal has profaned the
passion those fair eyes have inspired me with.

1685
01:40:08,895 --> 01:40:10,033
The fair eyes of my cash-box.

1686
01:40:10,761 --> 01:40:13,709
He speaks of it as
a lover does of his mistress.

1687
01:40:13,909 --> 01:40:17,072
Dame Claude knows the truth,
and she can bear witness to it.

1688
01:40:17,272 --> 01:40:20,438
My servant is an accomplice
in this affair?

1689
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:24,803
I say, I say...

1690
01:40:26,364 --> 01:40:28,751
Yes, sir, she was a witness
to our engagement...

1691
01:40:28,953 --> 01:40:33,599
...and she helped me to persuade
your daughter to engage herself to me.

1692
01:40:34,428 --> 01:40:37,087
Has the fear of justice
made him lose his senses?

1693
01:40:37,563 --> 01:40:39,659
What rubbish are you
talking about my daughter?

1694
01:40:39,767 --> 01:40:44,107
I found it most difficult to make her modesty
consent to what my love asked of her.

1695
01:40:44,478 --> 01:40:45,193
The modesty of whom?

1696
01:40:45,393 --> 01:40:46,348
Of your daughter...

1697
01:40:46,548 --> 01:40:49,995
...and it was only yesterday that she
signed our promise of marriage.

1698
01:40:50,859 --> 01:40:53,401
My daughter has signed a
promise of marriage?

1699
01:40:53,601 --> 01:40:54,957
Yes, sir, and I have also signed.

1700
01:40:56,179 --> 01:40:57,855
O heavens! Another misfortune!

1701
01:40:58,055 --> 01:40:59,657
Write, sir, write.

1702
01:40:59,857 --> 01:41:03,637
Aggravation of misery!
Excess of despair!

1703
01:41:03,672 --> 01:41:06,101
Sir, discharge your duty...

1704
01:41:06,292 --> 01:41:09,034
...and draw me up an indictment
against him as a thief and a suborner.

1705
01:41:09,234 --> 01:41:11,826
These are names which I do not deserve,
and when you know who I am...

1706
01:41:18,604 --> 01:41:22,037
Guilty daughter! Unworthy
of a father like me.

1707
01:41:22,171 --> 01:41:24,394
Is it thus that you put
into practice my lessons?

1708
01:41:24,594 --> 01:41:26,444
You give your
love to an infamous thief...

1709
01:41:26,644 --> 01:41:28,716
...and engage yourself to
him without my consent.

1710
01:41:28,916 --> 01:41:30,435
But you shall both be disappointed.

1711
01:41:30,635 --> 01:41:32,936
Four strong walls will answer for
your conduct in the future...

1712
01:41:33,072 --> 01:41:36,105
...and good gallows shall do me
justice for your audacity.

1713
01:41:36,305 --> 01:41:38,700
Your anger will be no
judge in this affair...

1714
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:41,189
...and I shall at least have
a hearing before I am condemned.

1715
01:41:41,389 --> 01:41:47,837
I was wrong to say gallows...
you shall be broken alive on the wheel.

1716
01:41:49,565 --> 01:41:50,926
Father!

1717
01:41:51,482 --> 01:41:53,641
Be more merciful,
I beseech you...

1718
01:41:53,841 --> 01:41:56,644
...and do not let your paternal
authority drive matters to extremes.

1719
01:41:56,844 --> 01:41:59,544
Do not be carried away by the first
outburst of your anger...

1720
01:41:59,744 --> 01:42:02,324
...but give yourself time to
consider what you do.

1721
01:42:02,524 --> 01:42:05,468
Take the trouble of inquiring about him
whose conduct has offended you.

1722
01:42:05,668 --> 01:42:07,636
He is not what you imagine.

1723
01:42:07,836 --> 01:42:12,392
Know that without him you
would long ago have lost me for ever.

1724
01:42:12,592 --> 01:42:16,409
Yes, father, it is he who saved me from
the great danger I ran in the waters...

1725
01:42:16,609 --> 01:42:18,139
...and to whom you owe the life
of that very daughter who...

1726
01:42:18,339 --> 01:42:21,445
It would have been much better for me if
he had suffered you to be drowned...

1727
01:42:21,645 --> 01:42:23,024
...rather than do what he has done.

1728
01:42:23,224 --> 01:42:24,551
My father, I beseech you,
in the name of paternal love...

1729
01:42:24,751 --> 01:42:28,431
I will hear nothing, and justice
must have its course.

1730
01:42:28,631 --> 01:42:30,678
You shall pay me for
the blows you gave me.

1731
01:42:30,878 --> 01:42:33,736
What a perplexing state of affairs!

1732
01:42:36,373 --> 01:42:39,284
You are quite upset,
Mr. Harpagon.

1733
01:42:39,484 --> 01:42:42,146
Mr. Anselme...

1734
01:42:42,346 --> 01:42:44,630
...you see in me the most
unfortunate of men...

1735
01:42:44,830 --> 01:42:48,324
...and you can never imagine what vexation is
connected with the contract you have come to sign.

1736
01:42:48,524 --> 01:42:51,529
I am attacked in my property. I am
attacked in my honour...

1737
01:42:51,729 --> 01:42:55,105
...and you see there a scoundrel who
has violated the most sacred rights...

1738
01:42:55,305 --> 01:42:58,449
...who has introduced himself into
my house in order to steal my money...

1739
01:42:58,649 --> 01:43:00,726
and seduce my daughter.

1740
01:43:00,926 --> 01:43:03,297
Who ever thought of your money?

1741
01:43:03,497 --> 01:43:07,155
They have given each other
a promise of marriage.

1742
01:43:07,355 --> 01:43:08,609
This insult concerns you,
Mr. Anselme...

1743
01:43:08,809 --> 01:43:10,846
...and it is you who ought to be
plaintiff against him...

1744
01:43:11,046 --> 01:43:15,139
...and who ought to prosecute him
to the utmost, in order to be revenged.

1745
01:43:15,339 --> 01:43:18,440
It is not my intention to force anybody,
and to lay claim to a heart already bestowed.

1746
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:22,763
But as far as your interests are concerned, I am
ready to espouse them as if they were my own.

1747
01:43:22,963 --> 01:43:25,510
This is the gentleman,
an honest commissary...

1748
01:43:25,710 --> 01:43:29,513
...who will omit nothing of what
concerns the duties of his office.

1749
01:43:29,713 --> 01:43:35,444
Charge him as he ought to be,
and make matters very criminal.

1750
01:43:36,702 --> 01:43:40,062
I do not see what crime they can make
of my passion for your daughter...

1751
01:43:40,262 --> 01:43:44,303
...nor the punishment you think I ought to be
condemned to. When it is known who I am...

1752
01:43:44,503 --> 01:43:46,110
I don't care a pin
for all those stories.

1753
01:43:46,310 --> 01:43:48,637
The world is full, nowadays,
of those pretenders to nobility...

1754
01:43:48,837 --> 01:43:51,518
...of those impostors, who
take advantage of their obscurity...

1755
01:43:51,718 --> 01:43:55,433
...and deck themselves out with the first
illustrious name that comes into their head.

1756
01:43:55,633 --> 01:43:58,958
Know that I am too upright to adorn myself
with a name which is not mine...

1757
01:43:59,158 --> 01:44:02,654
...and that all Naples can
bear testimony to my birth.

1758
01:44:02,854 --> 01:44:04,910
Take care of what you
are about to say.

1759
01:44:05,110 --> 01:44:06,935
You risk more than you think.

1760
01:44:07,135 --> 01:44:10,014
You speak before a man
to whom all Naples is known...

1761
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:13,011
...and who can soon see
if your story is true.

1762
01:44:12,379 --> 01:44:14,370
I am not the man
to fear anything...

1763
01:44:15,739 --> 01:44:17,942
...and if all Naples is known to you,
you know who was Don Thomas d'Alburci.

1764
01:44:18,142 --> 01:44:22,024
Few people know him
better than I do.

1765
01:44:22,224 --> 01:44:25,585
I care neither for Don Thomas
nor Don Martin.

1766
01:44:25,785 --> 01:44:28,176
Have patience. We shall soon know
what he has to say of him.

1767
01:44:28,376 --> 01:44:30,678
That it is to him that
I owe my birth.

1768
01:44:32,057 --> 01:44:34,669
To him?
- Yes.

1769
01:44:34,869 --> 01:44:35,881
You are laughing.

1770
01:44:36,081 --> 01:44:38,726
Try and make out a
more likely story...

1771
01:44:38,926 --> 01:44:41,706
...and don't pretend to shelter yourself
under such a piece of imposture.

1772
01:44:41,906 --> 01:44:43,153
Consider your words better
before you speak.

1773
01:44:43,353 --> 01:44:47,481
It is no imposture, and I say nothing
here that I cannot prove.

1774
01:44:49,216 --> 01:44:50,760
What?

1775
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:52,574
You dare to call
yourself the son...

1776
01:44:52,774 --> 01:44:54,280
...of Don Thomas d'Alburci?

1777
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:58,521
Yes, I dare to do so, and I am ready
to maintain the truth against anyone.

1778
01:44:58,721 --> 01:45:00,638
This audacity is marvellous.

1779
01:45:00,838 --> 01:45:02,628
Learn to your confusion...

1780
01:45:02,828 --> 01:45:07,121
...that it is sixteen years ago since this man died
in a shipwreck at sea with his wife and children...

1781
01:45:07,321 --> 01:45:12,095
...when he was trying to save their lives
from the persecutions in Naples...

1782
01:45:12,295 --> 01:45:14,515
...and which caused the banishment
of several noble families.

1783
01:45:14,655 --> 01:45:17,832
But learn to your confusion...

1784
01:45:18,032 --> 01:45:21,417
...that his son, seven years
of age, was, with a servant...

1785
01:45:21,617 --> 01:45:23,155
...saved from the wreck
by a Spanish vessel...

1786
01:45:23,355 --> 01:45:26,656
...and that this son is he
who now speaks to you.

1787
01:45:28,012 --> 01:45:32,754
The captain of that
ship befriended me...

1788
01:45:32,954 --> 01:45:34,867
...and brought me up as his own son.

1789
01:45:35,067 --> 01:45:37,884
...and that the profession of arms has
been my occupation ever since I was fit for it.

1790
01:45:38,084 --> 01:45:41,573
Lately I heard that
my father is not dead.

1791
01:45:41,773 --> 01:45:45,539
Passing this way to go and find him out,
an accident, arranged by heaven...

1792
01:45:45,739 --> 01:45:48,205
...brought to my sight
the charming Élise.

1793
01:45:49,529 --> 01:45:52,058
The sight of her made me
a slave to her beauty...

1794
01:45:53,512 --> 01:45:57,004
...and the violence of my love and
the harshness of her father...

1795
01:45:57,204 --> 01:46:01,966
...made me come into his house and send
some one else to look after my parents.

1796
01:46:02,166 --> 01:46:05,000
But what other proofs have you
besides your own words...

1797
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:07,909
...that all this is not a fable
based by you upon truth.

1798
01:46:08,874 --> 01:46:11,146
The captain of
the Spanish vessel...

1799
01:46:12,348 --> 01:46:14,581
...a ruby seal which
belonged to my father...

1800
01:46:14,781 --> 01:46:17,763
...an agate bracelet which my
mother put upon my arm...

1801
01:46:17,963 --> 01:46:20,932
...and old Pedro, that servant who
was saved with me from the wreck.

1802
01:46:21,132 --> 01:46:24,275
I can answer here for what you have said,
that you do not deceive us...

1803
01:46:24,475 --> 01:46:27,456
...and all you say clearly tells
me that you are my brother.

1804
01:46:28,437 --> 01:46:30,966
You my sister?

1805
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:36,527
Yes, my heart was touched
as soon as you began to speak.

1806
01:46:36,727 --> 01:46:40,446
Our mother often told me of the
misfortunes of our family.

1807
01:46:40,646 --> 01:46:42,774
Heaven spared us also
in that dreadful wreck...

1808
01:46:42,974 --> 01:46:46,001
...but our life was spared at
the cost of our liberty.

1809
01:46:46,201 --> 01:46:49,863
My mother and myself were taken up by
pirates from the wreck of our vessel.

1810
01:46:50,063 --> 01:46:53,312
After ten years of slavery a lucky
event gave us back to liberty...

1811
01:46:53,512 --> 01:46:54,937
...and we returned to Naples...

1812
01:46:55,137 --> 01:46:58,610
...where we found all our property
sold, and could hear no news of our father.

1813
01:46:58,810 --> 01:47:03,914
We embarked for Genoa, where my mother
went to gather a disputed family estate.

1814
01:47:04,114 --> 01:47:06,948
Leaving her unjust relatives...

1815
01:47:07,148 --> 01:47:09,993
...she came here,
where she has lived but a weary life.

1816
01:47:10,193 --> 01:47:13,619
O heaven! how wonderful
are thy doings!

1817
01:47:13,819 --> 01:47:19,010
How true it is that it only
belongs to thee to work miracles.

1818
01:47:19,210 --> 01:47:21,800
Come to my arms, my children.

1819
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,439
Share the joy of your happy father.

1820
01:47:25,639 --> 01:47:27,293
You are our father?

1821
01:47:29,199 --> 01:47:31,259
It was for you that
my mother wept?

1822
01:47:31,459 --> 01:47:32,288
Yes, my daughter.

1823
01:47:32,488 --> 01:47:34,067
Yes, my son.

1824
01:47:38,238 --> 01:47:40,957
I am Don Thomas d'Alburci...

1825
01:47:41,157 --> 01:47:44,009
...whom heaven saved
from the waves...

1826
01:47:44,209 --> 01:47:46,769
...and who believing you all dead...

1827
01:47:46,969 --> 01:47:49,289
...after 16 years, was preparing...

1828
01:47:49,489 --> 01:47:54,147
...after long journeys, to seek the
consolations of a new family...

1829
01:47:54,347 --> 01:47:56,573
...in marrying a
gentle and virtuous woman.

1830
01:47:57,391 --> 01:48:00,120
The little security there
was for my life in Naples...

1831
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:01,904
...has made me abandon the
idea of returning there...

1832
01:48:02,104 --> 01:48:04,857
...and having found the means
of selling what I had...

1833
01:48:05,057 --> 01:48:06,930
...I settled here...

1834
01:48:07,130 --> 01:48:11,487
...where, under the name of Anselme,
I wished to forget the sorrows...

1835
01:48:11,687 --> 01:48:15,786
...of a name associated with
so many and great troubles.

1836
01:48:16,365 --> 01:48:18,269
He is your son?
- Yes.

1837
01:48:18,469 --> 01:48:21,890
I make you responsible for the ten thousand
crowns that he has stolen from me.

1838
01:48:22,090 --> 01:48:23,903
He steal anything from you!
- Yes.

1839
01:48:24,103 --> 01:48:25,887
Who said so?
- Master Jacques.

1840
01:48:28,135 --> 01:48:29,625
You say that?

1841
01:48:29,825 --> 01:48:31,538
You see that I am
not saying anything.

1842
01:48:31,738 --> 01:48:34,574
He certainly did.

1843
01:48:34,774 --> 01:48:38,215
There is the officer who
has received his deposition.

1844
01:48:38,415 --> 01:48:40,330
Yes.

1845
01:48:42,159 --> 01:48:44,813
Can you really believe me
capable of such a base action?

1846
01:48:45,013 --> 01:48:48,401
Capable or not capable,
I must find my money.

1847
01:48:48,601 --> 01:48:51,512
Do not grieve for your
money, father...

1848
01:48:51,712 --> 01:48:53,669
...and accuse any one.

1849
01:48:53,869 --> 01:48:56,230
I have news of it...

1850
01:48:56,430 --> 01:48:58,231
...and I come here to tell you...

1851
01:48:58,431 --> 01:49:01,496
...that if you consent to let me
marry Marianne...

1852
01:49:01,696 --> 01:49:03,940
...your money will be
given back to you.

1853
01:49:06,435 --> 01:49:07,174
Where is it?

1854
01:49:07,374 --> 01:49:08,614
Do not trouble yourself
about that.

1855
01:49:08,814 --> 01:49:12,276
It is in a safe place, and I
answer for it.

1856
01:49:12,311 --> 01:49:14,901
It is for you to decide...

1857
01:49:15,101 --> 01:49:16,757
...and you have the choice...

1858
01:49:16,957 --> 01:49:19,658
...either of losing Marianne...

1859
01:49:19,858 --> 01:49:22,021
...or your cash-box.

1860
01:49:23,228 --> 01:49:24,644
Has nothing been taken out?

1861
01:49:24,844 --> 01:49:26,440
Nothing at all.

1862
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:29,436
Is it your intention to agree
to this marriage...

1863
01:49:29,636 --> 01:49:32,925
...and to join your consent
to that of her mother...

1864
01:49:33,125 --> 01:49:37,602
...who leaves her at
liberty to do as she likes?

1865
01:49:43,423 --> 01:49:46,315
But you do not know that this
consent is no longer sufficient...

1866
01:49:46,515 --> 01:49:48,776
...and that heaven has given
me back a brother at the same time...

1867
01:49:48,976 --> 01:49:51,411
...that it has given me back a father and
you have now to obtain me from him.

1868
01:49:51,611 --> 01:49:55,185
Heaven has not restored you to
me to oppose your wishes.

1869
01:49:55,385 --> 01:49:58,678
Mr. Harpagon, you must be aware
that the choice of a young girl...

1870
01:49:58,878 --> 01:50:00,704
...is more likely to fall upon
the son than upon the father.

1871
01:50:00,904 --> 01:50:03,219
Do not force people to say
to you what is unnecessary...

1872
01:50:03,419 --> 01:50:06,326
...and consent, as I do, to
this double marriage.

1873
01:50:06,799 --> 01:50:11,882
In order for me to be well advised,
I must see my casket.

1874
01:50:12,082 --> 01:50:14,781
You shall see it safe and sound.

1875
01:50:14,981 --> 01:50:19,643
I have no money to give
my children in marriage.

1876
01:50:19,843 --> 01:50:22,297
Never mind, I have some.
Do not let this trouble you.

1877
01:50:22,497 --> 01:50:26,930
Do you take upon yourself to defray
the expenses of these two weddings?

1878
01:50:27,130 --> 01:50:29,483
Yes, I will take this
responsibility upon myself.

1879
01:50:29,683 --> 01:50:31,485
Are you satisfied?

1880
01:50:31,685 --> 01:50:37,402
Yes, provided you order me a new
suit of clothes for the wedding.

1881
01:50:37,602 --> 01:50:39,410
Agreed!

1882
01:51:25,809 --> 01:51:29,555
Let us go and enjoy the blessings
this happy day brings us.

1883
01:52:06,121 --> 01:52:08,799
Stop, sirs, stop.

1884
01:52:08,999 --> 01:52:10,546
Who is to pay me for my writing?

1885
01:52:10,746 --> 01:52:12,805
We have nothing to do
with your writing.

1886
01:52:13,005 --> 01:52:16,804
Indeed, and yet I do not pretend
to have done it for nothing.

1887
01:52:33,808 --> 01:52:36,586
There is a fellow you can
hang in payment.

1888
01:52:38,117 --> 01:52:40,886
What is one to do?

1889
01:52:41,086 --> 01:52:43,338
I receive a good cudgelling
for telling the truth...

1890
01:52:43,538 --> 01:52:45,661
...and now they would
hang me for lying.

1891
01:52:45,861 --> 01:52:49,629
Mr. Harpagon, you must forgive
him this piece of imposture.

1892
01:52:49,829 --> 01:52:51,273
You will pay the officer then?

1893
01:52:51,377 --> 01:52:52,471
Let it be so.

1894
01:53:27,546 --> 01:53:30,616
To see my dear casket.

1895
01:53:40,493 --> 01:53:42,335
Harpagon.

1896
01:53:48,838 --> 01:53:53,226
Good luck, dear Harpagon.
