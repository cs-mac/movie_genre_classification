TAKING MY WIFE

YOU GOING
TO SEE THE FIGHT?

53
00:03:16,454 --> 00:03:17,955
NO. JUST TAKE IN
SOME SHOWS.

54
00:03:17,955 --> 00:03:18,956
DO A LITTLE DANCING.

55
00:03:18,956 --> 00:03:19,957

YOU GONNA DO

56

2 FLAT LEFT FEET.

YEAH, IF YOU
DON'T WATCH IT,

60

68
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:41,979
WATCH YOUR LIPS,

69
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:43,480
BECAUSE THEY MAY
GET YOU INTO SOMETHING

70
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:46,484
THAT YOUR BEHIND
CAN'T GET YOU OUT OF.

71
00:03:46,484 --> 00:03:48,486
AND YOU
MAY HAVE 2 LEFT FEET

72
00:03:48,486 --> 00:03:49,987
DEAD IN YOUR STERNUM.

73
00:03:49,987 --> 00:03:51,989
I THINK WE CAN
GET IT ON RIGHT NOW.

00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:54,491
WHAT? WHAT?!

75

BACK AND FORTH.

00:04:00,498 --> 00:04:01,499
I'M SICK OF IT.
I DON'T CARE

132
00:06:27,311 --> 00:06:28,812
YOU BETTER
CHANGE YOUR PANTS

YOU'VE GOTTA DO IT!

135

WE'RE RUNNING
AN HOUR LATE ALREADY.

136
00:07:07,852 --> 00:07:10,855
MAYBE THEY'RE TAKING
SO LONG IS A GOOD SIGN.

137
00:07:10,855 --> 00:07:11,856

TO START THE MEETING.

139

BILLY AIN'T HERE?

143
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:28,372

144
00:07:28,372 --> 00:07:30,374
WHAT THEY SAY?

146
00:07:38,382 --> 00:07:40,384
BILLY FOSTER,
WILL YOU HURRY UP?

147
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:42,386
EVERYBODY'S IN THERE
WAITING ON YOU.

148
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,892
BILLY,
WHERE IS OUR CAR?

149
00:07:47,892 --> 00:07:48,893
I SOLD THE CAR.

150
00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:49,894
WHAT YOU SELL
OUR CAR FOR?

151
00:07:49,894 --> 00:07:51,395
I SOLD THE CAR.

152
00:07:51,395 --> 00:07:53,397
IS IT OUR WEDDING
ANNIVERSARY TOMORROW

153
00:07:53,397 --> 00:07:55,899
OR IS IT NOT OUR WEDDING
ANNIVERSARY TOMORROW?

154
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,902
SO WHAT?
SO, FOR 14 YEARS,

155
00:07:57,902 --> 00:07:59,403
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING
YOUR FINGERS TO THE BONE

156
00:07:59,403 --> 00:08:01,405
FROM SUNRISE TO SUNDOWN,

157
00:08:01,405 --> 00:08:02,906
AND I'VE
NEVER HAD A DOLLAR

158
00:08:02,907 --> 00:08:03,908
TO SPEND NOTHING
ON YOU,

159
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:06,410
SO I SOLD THE CAR.

160
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,911
I'M TAKING MY WIFE
TO NEW ORLEANS

00:08:07,912 --> 00:08:09,413
FOR THE WEEKEND.

162
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,418
A MAN CAN ALWAYS
GET A CHEAP CAR,

163
00:08:14,418 --> 00:08:18,422
BUT HE
CAN'T GET A WIFE.

164
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:23,427
AIN'T THAT SWEET?

165
00:08:23,427 --> 00:08:24,928
YEAH.

00:08:27,431 --> 00:08:29,766
I AM.

169

170
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:32,269
AND I'M GONNA BE.

171
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:33,270
YES, YOU WILL.

172
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,771
TRIUMPH HAVE I?

173
00:08:34,772 --> 00:08:35,773
YES!

174
00:08:35,773 --> 00:08:36,774
STEADY OF HEART?

175
00:08:36,774 --> 00:08:38,275
YES!

176
00:08:38,275 --> 00:08:39,776
NO VALLEY OF SORROW
IS DEEP ENOUGH.

177
00:08:39,777 --> 00:08:40,778
NO!

178
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:42,780
NO MOUNTAIN OF PLEASURE
IS HIGH ENOUGH.

179
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,781
NO!

180
00:08:43,781 --> 00:08:46,283
TO CAUSE MY FEET
TO STUMBLE ONE STEP

181
00:08:46,283 --> 00:08:47,784
IN OUR EVERLASTING
JOURNEY

182
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:49,787
TO THE RIGHTEOUS
SIDE OF LIFE.

183
00:08:49,787 --> 00:08:51,288
PRAISE TO HIM!

184
00:08:51,288 --> 00:08:53,790
AND MARCHING OUT AT THE HEAD
OF OUR GREAT MULTITUDE

185
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,793
TO SHOW US THE WAY
IS OUR FOUNDER.

186
00:08:55,793 --> 00:08:57,795
THE GREAT, GREAT, GREAT
GRAND WARRIOR

187
00:08:57,795 --> 00:08:59,296
OF THE KINGDOM OF SHAKA.

188
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:01,798
PRAISE TO THE KINGDOM!

189
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:04,301
HE STAMPED HIS FEET
ON THE GROUND THAT IS AFRICA

190
00:09:04,301 --> 00:09:06,803
AND THE EARTH TREMBLED.

191
00:09:06,804 --> 00:09:08,806
TO THE EVIL,
HE SHOWS NO MERCY.

192
00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:10,307
NO!

193
00:09:10,307 --> 00:09:12,309
TO THE DECEITFUL,
HIS BLOWS ARE SWIFT.

194
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:13,810
YES!

195
00:09:13,811 --> 00:09:15,813
BUT TO
THE PURE IN HEART,

196
00:09:15,813 --> 00:09:17,314
HE IS LOVE.

197
00:09:17,314 --> 00:09:19,316
LOVE, BROTHERS
AND SISTERS.

198
00:09:19,316 --> 00:09:21,318
HE IS OUR LEADER.

199
00:09:21,318 --> 00:09:23,320
THE GREAT, GREAT,
GREAT GRAND WARRIOR

200
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,322
OF THE KINGDOM OF SHAKA!

201
00:09:25,322 --> 00:09:27,824
ALL PRAISES DUE
TO OUR FOUNDER!

202
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:29,326
ALL PRAISES DUE

203
00:09:29,326 --> 00:09:31,828
TO THE KINGDOM OF SHAKA!

205
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:53,350
BROTHERS AND SISTERS...

206
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,852
ANOTHER DAY HAS DAWNED,

207
00:09:55,853 --> 00:09:56,854
AND THOUGH WE ARE HERE

208
00:09:56,854 --> 00:09:58,856
IN OUR GOOD HEALTH
AND STRENGTH,

209
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:01,358
TODAY IS NOT A GOOD DAY
FOR US.

210
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:03,860
THE CITY HAS REFUSED

211
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:06,363
TO GRANT US THE EXTENSION
THAT WE WANTED.

213
00:10:07,865 --> 00:10:10,367
AND SO I GUESS THE BEST WAY
TO START THIS MEETING

214
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:12,869
IS WITH A FINANCIAL REPORT
ON OUR SITUATION

215
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,373
FROM OUR TREASURER,
BROTHER BILLY FOSTER.

216
00:10:20,878 --> 00:10:22,880
WELL, WE ALL
KNOW THE SITUATION.

217
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,882
WE HAVE KNOWN
FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS

218
00:10:24,882 --> 00:10:26,884
THAT THIS CITY WAS GONNA
TURN DOWN THIS SECTION

219
00:10:26,884 --> 00:10:28,886
COMMENCING NEXT YEAR.

220
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:32,890
IN 6 WEEKS, WE'VE GOT
TO BE OUT OF THIS BUILDING.

222
00:10:34,391 --> 00:10:36,393
2 YEARS AGO,
Y'ALL MADE PLEDGES

223
00:10:36,393 --> 00:10:37,894
TO THE NEW BUILDING FUND,

224
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:39,897
AND YOU'VE FULFILLED
THOSE PLEDGES,

225
00:10:39,897 --> 00:10:41,398
BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

226
00:10:41,398 --> 00:10:42,899
BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
FOR THE PAST 2 YEARS,

227
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,902
WE'VE BEEN
RAKING AND SCRAPING,

228
00:10:44,902 --> 00:10:48,906
BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH.

229
00:10:48,906 --> 00:10:51,408
THE INITIAL COST
OF THE CONSTRUCTION

230
00:10:51,408 --> 00:10:53,410
IS $55,000.

231
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,412
THAT MEANS WE GOT
TO HAVE AT LEAST THAT

232
00:10:55,412 --> 00:10:57,914
BEFORE WE CAN START.

233
00:10:57,915 --> 00:10:59,416
AND SO FAR IN THE KITTY,

234
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:02,919
WE'VE GOT $18,000.

236
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:06,924
NOW WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?

237
00:11:06,924 --> 00:11:08,926
WHAT ARE WE GOING
TO DO ABOUT IT?

238
00:11:08,926 --> 00:11:09,927
FIGHT IT.

239
00:11:09,927 --> 00:11:12,429
TIGHTEN UP AND DIG DEEPER.

240
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:14,431
NOW, I KNOW
IT'S GONNA BE ROUGH.

241
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:16,933
IT IS NOW OR NEVER.

242
00:11:19,937 --> 00:11:21,438
NOW THE SONS AND
DAUGHTERS OF SHAKA

243
00:11:21,438 --> 00:11:24,441
HAVE ALWAYS THRIVED
ON ADVERSITY.

244
00:11:24,441 --> 00:11:25,442
THAT'S RIGHT!

245
00:11:25,442 --> 00:11:27,944
WE LIVE TO OVERCOME
SUFFERING.

246
00:11:27,945 --> 00:11:28,946
YES!

247
00:11:28,946 --> 00:11:32,449
WE LIVE TO CREATE LIGHT
WHERE THERE WAS DARKNESS.

248
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:33,450
YES!

249
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,452
WE HAVE GOT TO PUT
OUR HEART IN IT.

250
00:11:35,452 --> 00:11:36,453
YES!

251
00:11:36,453 --> 00:11:37,954
WE'VE GOT TO PUT
OUR SOUL IN IT.

252
00:11:37,955 --> 00:11:39,456
YES!

253
00:11:39,456 --> 00:11:41,458
WE'VE GOTTA PUT
OUR SPIRITS IN IT.

254
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,459
YES!

255
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:44,461
AND WE'VE GOT TO PUT
SOME MORE MONEY IN IT!

256
00:12:58,535 --> 00:13:01,037
THAT MONEY
SHOULD BE IN A BANK!

257
00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:04,041
IT WAS.

258
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,543
WE CAN GO TO JAIL
IF THIS DON'T WORK.

259
00:13:06,543 --> 00:13:07,544
IT'S GONNA WORK.

260
00:13:07,544 --> 00:13:09,045
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

261
00:13:09,046 --> 00:13:10,047
YEAH, BUT YOU'VE
STILL GOT THE TOUCH

262
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:12,049
BECAUSE I REMEMBER
AT SISTER JOAN'S PARTY

263
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:13,550
WITH VICTOR BROWN,

264
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,551
YOU HAD HIM
GOING AROUND THERE

265
00:13:14,551 --> 00:13:16,553
CROWING LIKE A ROOSTER
IN A HENHOUSE.

266
00:13:16,553 --> 00:13:19,055
ROOOOO!

267
00:13:19,056 --> 00:13:20,557
KOO-KOO-ROO!

268
00:13:20,557 --> 00:13:23,059
THAT'S RIGHT.
HEH HEH HEH!

269
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,062
$2,000.

270
00:13:25,062 --> 00:13:26,563
MORTGAGED
MY FURNITURE,

271
00:13:26,563 --> 00:13:28,064
SOLD MY CAR, CLOSED
OUT MY BANK ACCOUNT.

272
00:13:28,065 --> 00:13:29,566
$2,000 FROM ME.

273
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:31,568
$18,000
FROM THE LODGE.

274
00:13:31,568 --> 00:13:33,570
$20,000.

275
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,571
$20,000.

276
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:37,073
20,000.

277
00:13:37,074 --> 00:13:39,076
NO. UN-UH.

278
00:13:39,076 --> 00:13:40,577
NO, MAN. I'M A MILKMAN.

279
00:13:40,577 --> 00:13:42,579
YOU'RE A FACTORY WORKER!
WE DON'T LOOK LIKE NOBODY

280
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:44,581
WHO'D COME UP
WITH NO $20,000.

281
00:13:44,581 --> 00:13:46,082
WE GONNA LOOK LIKE
WE GOT A MILLION.

282
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,584
HOW?

283
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:48,585
YOU JUST LEAVE THAT
UP TO ME.

284
00:13:48,585 --> 00:13:51,087
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THAT.

285
00:13:58,095 --> 00:14:01,598
OUR WOMEN MUST NEVER
KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS.

286
00:14:01,598 --> 00:14:03,600
NEVER. THEY'RE JUST
GOING TO NEW ORLEANS

287
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,602
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

289
00:14:16,113 --> 00:14:19,616

00:16:20,404 --> 00:16:22,406
I'VE EVER HAD
IN MY LIFE.

320
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:24,908
IS, UM, THAT
ALL I'M GONNA GET?

321
00:16:24,908 --> 00:16:26,409
WELL, THAT'S ALL YOU
GONNA GET IN PUBLIC.

322
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,912
HO HO HO!
OHH! STOP!

323
00:16:28,912 --> 00:16:30,914
WHOO!

324
00:16:30,914 --> 00:16:32,916
YOU FRESH THING!

325
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:33,917
YOU KNOW YOU LOVE IT.

326
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:36,920
YES, I DO.
WHOO!

327
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,922
AND TONIGHT, I'M GONNA
LAY A BLOCKBUSTER ON YOU

328
00:16:38,922 --> 00:16:40,423
TONIGHT.

329
00:16:40,424 --> 00:16:41,425
YEAH?

330
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:42,426
WELL, I'M GONNA
HAVE A BLOCK

331
00:16:42,426 --> 00:16:43,927
FOR YOU
TO BUST, TOO, BABY,

332
00:16:43,927 --> 00:16:45,428
SO YOU BETTER BRING
A WHOLE LOT OF HAMMER.

333
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:48,432
HAVE HAMMER, WILL TRAVEL

334
00:16:48,432 --> 00:16:50,934
AND GO DEEP
INTO YOUR CREVICE.

335
00:16:53,937 --> 00:16:54,938
Beth!

336
00:16:54,938 --> 00:16:56,940
WELL,
IT'S THE TRUTH.

337
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,442
WELL, I KNOW,
BUT I CERTAINLY WISH

338
00:16:59,443 --> 00:17:01,445
YOU TWO WOULD STOP
PUTTING YOUR BUSINESS

339
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:02,946
IN THE STREET LIKE THAT,
AND THAT'S ALL.

340
00:17:02,946 --> 00:17:04,948
ARE YOU GONNA SIT
THERE AND ACT ALL PROPER

341
00:17:04,948 --> 00:17:05,949
LIKE CLYDE
AIN'T BEEN HITTING

342
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:07,951
YOUR SWITCH
REGULARLY?

343
00:17:07,951 --> 00:17:09,953
UH-UH! I AIN'T IN IT.

344
00:17:09,953 --> 00:17:10,954
I COULD SAY
SOMETHING,

345
00:17:10,954 --> 00:17:13,456
BUT I WON'T.
HEH HEH!

346
00:17:13,457 --> 00:17:15,959
OF COURSE CLYDE
AND ME HAVE RELATIONS.

347
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,460
WE CERTAINLY DON'T LET

348
00:17:17,461 --> 00:17:19,963
THE WHOLE WORLD KNOW
ABOUT IT. DO WE, HONEY?

349
00:17:19,963 --> 00:17:22,465
UH-UH. ME AND DEE DEE,
WE DON'T MAKE NO NOISE.

350
00:17:22,466 --> 00:17:25,469
WE WHISPER A LOT.
HEH HEH HEH!

352
00:17:29,473 --> 00:17:30,974
OH, BABY, OH, BABY!

353
00:17:30,974 --> 00:17:33,476
SHH!

354
00:17:33,477 --> 00:17:35,479
WE ALL GROWN.

355
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:36,480
AND WE KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

356
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,481
BESIDES, IT'S
OUR ANNIVERSARY.

357
00:17:37,481 --> 00:17:39,983
YES, WELL, I KNOW THAT.

358
00:17:39,983 --> 00:17:41,985
BUT SUPPOSE SOMEBODY
WHO DIDN'T KNOW YOU

359
00:17:41,985 --> 00:17:42,986
HEARD YOU
TALKING LIKE THAT?

360
00:17:42,986 --> 00:17:43,987
I MEAN,
WHAT WOULD THEY SAY?

361
00:17:43,987 --> 00:17:45,488
THEY WOULD SAY
I WAS HAVING

362
00:17:45,489 --> 00:17:46,990
A HORNY CONVERSATION
WITH A MAN

363
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,491
IN A FANCY
RESTAURANT,

364
00:17:48,492 --> 00:17:49,993
AND HE WAS PICKING
UP ON MY VIBE.

365
00:17:49,993 --> 00:17:52,495
PICKING UP ON THEM.

366
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,501
DEE DEE,
I DIDN'T KNOW

367
00:17:57,501 --> 00:17:59,002
YOU WERE A PRUDE.

368
00:17:59,002 --> 00:18:01,004
WELL, I AM NOT A PRU--

369
00:18:01,004 --> 00:18:03,506
I AM NOT A PRUDE.

370
00:18:03,507 --> 00:18:06,009
BUT THERE ARE SOME
THINGS THAT I WON'T DO,

371
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:08,011
AND THAT'S ALL.

372
00:18:09,012 --> 00:18:12,515
WELL, LA-DEE-DA.

373
00:18:19,022 --> 00:18:20,523
HEH HEH HEH!

374
00:18:40,076 --> 00:18:42,578
BABY, THAT
WAS A GOOD LUNCH.

375
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,080
NOW I'M READY
FOR A NAP,

376
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,082
BUT FIRST I'M GONNA
GO TAKE A WEE-WEE.

377
00:18:46,082 --> 00:18:48,084
DEE DEE,
COME ON AND GO

378
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:49,585
TO THE POWDER ROOM
WITH ME.

379
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:53,089
COME ON, GIRL.

380
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,603
YOU TELL ME WHY?
WHY?

381
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,611
THE FELLA
WITH THE PINK FLOWER,

382
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:18,114
THE BIGGEST OF THE BIG-TIME
GAMBLERS IN LOUISIANA.

383
00:19:18,114 --> 00:19:21,117
KANSAS CITY MACK. OWNS
THIS RESTAURANT RIGHT HERE.

384
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:23,119
YOUR BOOKS DON'T LOOK GOOD
AND I DON'T LIKE IT.

385
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:25,121
22% OFF CAN ONLY MEAN
ONE THING--

386
00:19:25,121 --> 00:19:26,622
BAD MANAGEMENT.

387
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,625
YOU, YOU GOT TO START
INCREASING YOUR VOLUME NOW

388
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,626
IN ALL YOUR OPERATIONS,

389
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,628
ESPECIALLY IN THE GAMBLING
AND JOY HOUSES

390
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,629
AND THE LIQUOR BUSINESS.

391
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,630
BOSS, INFLATION--

392
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,131
INFLATION AIN'T BOTHERING
BIGGIE SMALLS

393
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:36,632
AND HIS BOYS IN KENTUCKY
AND ALABAMA.

394
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,635
THEY'RE ROLLING RIGHT ALONG,
HEADING IN THIS DIRECTION.

395
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,637
AND IT'S YOUR TERRITORY
THEY'RE GONNA GRAB FIRST.

396
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,639
WE'RE PUSHING
AS HARD AS WE CAN.

397
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,140
WE'RE ON TOP OF IT
7 DAYS A WEEK.

398
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,641
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
YOU'VE GOT TO COME UP

399
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,143
WITH SOME NEW IDEAS.

400
00:19:47,143 --> 00:19:48,144
THAT'S WHY BIGGIE SMALLS
AND HIS BOYS

401
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:49,645
KEEP BEATING US
TO THE PUNCH.

402
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,147
HE GOT THEM YOUNG,
COLLEGE-EDUCATED FAGGOTS

403
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:52,648
DOING HIS THINKING
FOR HIM.

404
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,150
MAYBE Y'ALL TOO OLD.

405
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,153
MAYBE Y'ALL NEED
TO TAKE A WALK.

406
00:19:57,153 --> 00:19:58,654
MAYBE I OUGHT
TO GET SOME OF THEM

407
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,156
YOUNG COLLEGE-EDUCATED
FAGGOTS

408
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:03,159
TO DO MY THINKING
FOR ME, HUH? HUH?

409
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,664
NOW, HOW THINGS LOOKING
ON THIS FIGHT?

410
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,666
NOT SO GOOD. WE'RE
GETTING PLENTY OF ACTION

411
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,668
ON 40th STREET BLACK,
BUT NOTHING ON FARNSWORTH.

412
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,169
WELL, THAT FIGURES.
EVEN FARNSWORTH'S MAMA

413
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:14,670
AIN'T DUMB ENOUGH
TO BET ON HIM.

414
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,672
WELL, LOOK,
USE YOUR HEADS.

415
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,173
IF THERE AIN'T NO
FARNSWORTH MONEY AROUND,

416
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:19,675
CLOSE YOUR BOOKS
AND SIT THIS ONE OUT.

418
00:20:35,492 --> 00:20:37,994
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
WELCOME TO THE TRAINING CAMP

419
00:20:37,994 --> 00:20:39,996
OF THE MIDDLEWEIGHT CHAMPION
OF THE WORLD

420
00:20:39,996 --> 00:20:41,998
WHO WILL DEFEND
HIS CHAMPIONSHIP

421
00:20:41,998 --> 00:20:43,499
THE NIGHT AFTER TOMORROW

422
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,002
RIGHT HERE IN THE FABULOUS
CITY OF NEW ORLEANS

423
00:20:46,002 --> 00:20:47,503
AT THE SPORTS CENTER.

424
00:20:47,504 --> 00:20:49,506
HE IS NOW
COMING TO THE RING

425
00:20:49,506 --> 00:20:51,508
TO SPAR IN 3 ROUNDS
OF BOXING

426
00:20:51,508 --> 00:20:53,009
FOR YOUR ENTERTAINMENT.

427
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:54,510
THE MIDDLEWEIGHT CHAMPION
OF THE WORLD

428
00:20:54,511 --> 00:20:56,012
40th STREET BLACK!

429
00:20:56,012 --> 00:20:58,014
LET'S HEAR IT,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

430
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:34,551
ANYBODY
RUNNING INTO HIM

431
00:21:34,551 --> 00:21:37,053
BETTER BE DRIVING
A MACK TRUCK.

432
00:21:54,571 --> 00:21:57,073
OK, LET'S GO SEE
THE CHALLENGER.

433
00:21:57,073 --> 00:21:58,074
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

434
00:21:58,074 --> 00:21:59,075
BOOTNEY FARNSWORTH.

435
00:21:59,075 --> 00:22:00,576
BOOTNEY FARNSWORTH?

436
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,081
COME ON, BOOTNEY,
KEEP YOUR RIGHT UP,

437
00:22:05,081 --> 00:22:06,582
KEEP YOUR RIGHT UP,
PROTECT YOURSELF, BABY!

438
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,585
PROTECT YOURSELF!
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE, JAB!

439
00:22:08,585 --> 00:22:10,086
JAB, JAB, JAB, JAB!

440
00:22:10,086 --> 00:22:11,587
THERE YOU GO,
THERE YOU GO!

441
00:22:11,588 --> 00:22:13,089
THROW THEM PUNCHES IN,
THROW THEM PUNCHES IN.

442
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:14,590
MOVE, MOVE,
BOOTNEY, MOVE!

444
00:22:16,092 --> 00:22:17,093
OOH!

445
00:22:17,093 --> 00:22:18,594
HEY, HONEY, BOOTNEY FARNSWORTH
IS KNOCKING OUT

446
00:22:18,595 --> 00:22:20,096
HIS FELLAS, TOO.

447
00:22:20,096 --> 00:22:22,598
NO, DEAR, THAT'S
BOOTNEY FARNSWORTH THERE.

448
00:22:29,606 --> 00:22:30,607
LOOK, LOOK HERE.

449
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,612
MOVE. USE YOUR JAB.
UNDERSTAND?

450
00:22:36,613 --> 00:22:37,614
DON'T TRY
TO SLUG IT OUT.

451
00:22:37,614 --> 00:22:39,115
IF YOU GET TAGGED,
CLENCH.

452
00:22:39,115 --> 00:22:41,117
KEEP YOUR GLOVES UP HIGH
AND PROTECT YOURSELF.

453
00:22:41,117 --> 00:22:42,118
OK, LET'S GO.

454
00:22:42,118 --> 00:22:44,120
GO GET HIM.
TAKE HIM.

455
00:22:45,622 --> 00:22:47,624
PUNCH, PUNCH!

456
00:22:47,624 --> 00:22:49,626
COVER UP!
MOVE IT, MOVE!

457
00:22:55,131 --> 00:22:58,134
40th STREET BLACK IS
GONNA KILL THAT POOR BABY.

458
00:23:06,142 --> 00:23:08,144
HERE'S
YOUR PRESS CARD.

459
00:23:08,144 --> 00:23:09,145
WHERE'D
YOU GET THESE?

460
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:11,147
I PRINTED THEM UP
MYSELF.

462
00:23:28,665 --> 00:23:31,668
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS GOT
ONE MINUTE AND THAT'S IT.

463
00:23:31,668 --> 00:23:33,169
MY FIGHTER'S GOTTA EAT
AND GET SOME SLEEP.

464
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:34,670
ON THE BASIS
OF YOUR LAST FIGHT,

465
00:23:34,671 --> 00:23:35,672
A SPLIT DECISION
OVER MARTIN,

466
00:23:35,672 --> 00:23:37,173
DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU DESERVE
A SHOT AT THE TITLE?

467
00:23:37,173 --> 00:23:38,674
MARTIN WAS A PUSHOVER.

468
00:23:38,675 --> 00:23:40,176
BOOTNEY WAS CARRYING HIM.

469
00:23:40,176 --> 00:23:41,677
I HEAR YOUR SPARRING
PARTNER DECKED YOU TODAY.

470
00:23:41,678 --> 00:23:42,679
HE SLIPPED.

471
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:44,180
Second reporter:
BOOTNEY, WORD'S GOING AROUND

472
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,181
THAT YOU'RE
NOT REALLY IN SHAPE.

473
00:23:45,181 --> 00:23:46,182
WHAT DO YOU SAY
ABOUT THAT?

474
00:23:46,182 --> 00:23:48,184
LIES, PROPAGANDA!

475
00:23:48,184 --> 00:23:49,685
THEN WHY ARE YOU
A 5-TO-1 UNDERDOG?

476
00:23:49,686 --> 00:23:51,688
BECAUSE WE DO OUR
FIGHTING IN THE RING,

477
00:23:51,688 --> 00:23:53,690
NOT IN THE NEWSPAPER
LIKE THAT BIG-MOUTH,

478
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,191
EMPTY-HEADED SISSY.

479
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:56,192
CAN WE QUOTE
YOU, BOOTNEY?

480
00:23:56,192 --> 00:23:58,694
YEAH, YOU CAN QUOTE HIM!
YOU TELL THE WORLD

481
00:23:58,695 --> 00:24:00,196
WHEN WE GET THROUGH
WITH 40th STREET BLACK

482
00:24:00,196 --> 00:24:02,698
HE'S GONNA LOOK LIKE
30th STREET YELLOW.

483
00:24:02,699 --> 00:24:04,200
BOOTNEY,
ANY TRUTH TO THE RUMOR

484
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,701
THAT YOU'RE DEVELOPING
A SECRET PUNCH?

485
00:24:05,702 --> 00:24:08,204
DON'T ANSWER THAT,
BOOTNEY!

486
00:24:08,204 --> 00:24:09,205
EVERYTHING
IN ITS PROPER PLACE.

487
00:24:09,205 --> 00:24:11,207
IF YOU LOSE, BOOTNEY,
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS?

488
00:24:11,207 --> 00:24:12,708
WE CAN'T ANSWER THAT,

489
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:15,211
BECAUSE LOSING'S THE LAST
THING WE THINK ABOUT.

490
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:16,212
Reporter:
HOW LONG'S

491
00:24:16,212 --> 00:24:17,213
THE FIGHT GONNA
LAST, BOOTNEY?

492
00:24:17,213 --> 00:24:18,714
IT WON'T GO THE DISTANCE.

493
00:24:18,715 --> 00:24:20,717
BOOTNEY, IF YOU WIN,
WILL YOU BE AN ACTIVE CHAMPION?

494
00:24:20,717 --> 00:24:22,218
WE'LL FIGHT ANYBODY,
ANYWHERE.

495
00:24:22,218 --> 00:24:23,719
ONE LITTLE PERSONAL
QUESTION, BOOTNEY.

496
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,221
HOW'S YOUR LOVE LIFE?

498
00:24:27,223 --> 00:24:31,227
HOW'S HIS LOVE LIFE?
HOW'S HIS LOVE LIFE?!

499
00:24:31,227 --> 00:24:34,730
HE'S GOT HIS HANDS FULL!

500
00:24:34,731 --> 00:24:36,733
OK, IT'S TIME TO GIVE
MY FIGHTER SOME REST.

501
00:24:36,733 --> 00:24:38,234
SO UP AND OUT, LET'S GO.

502
00:24:38,234 --> 00:24:39,235
YOU KNOW WHAT TO WRITE,

503
00:24:39,235 --> 00:24:40,236
YOU KNOW
WHAT PICTURES TO PRINT.

504
00:24:40,236 --> 00:24:41,737
I APPRECIATE
YOU COMING DOWN.

505
00:24:41,738 --> 00:24:44,240
WE'LL SEE YOU WHEN WE
WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP, OK?

506
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,242
OUT YOU GO, FELLAS.
THANKS A LOT FOR COMING BY.

507
00:24:46,242 --> 00:24:48,244
APPRECIATE IT A LOT.

508
00:24:57,754 --> 00:25:01,758
MR. ELLISON.

509
00:25:01,758 --> 00:25:03,259
YOU REALLY THINK
I GOT A CHANCE?

510
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:05,761
HE'S GONNA BEAT
YOUR BRAINS IN, BOOTNEY.

511
00:25:08,264 --> 00:25:10,266
BOOTNEY...

512
00:25:10,266 --> 00:25:12,768
BOOTNEY...

513
00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:16,773
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING,
BUT WE JUST CAN'T SEEM TO--

514
00:25:18,274 --> 00:25:21,777
YES, YOU DO
HAVE A CHANCE, SON.

515
00:25:21,778 --> 00:25:22,779
BUT NOT
A GOOD ONE, HUH?

516
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:26,282
NO, NOT A GOOD CHANCE.

517
00:25:26,282 --> 00:25:27,783
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW.

518
00:25:29,786 --> 00:25:32,288
COME ON, KID.
GET SOME REST.

519
00:25:32,288 --> 00:25:34,790
WE'VE GOT ANOTHER DAY'S
WORK AHEAD OF US.

520
00:26:07,991 --> 00:26:10,994
Bootney Farnsworth,
Bootney Farnsworth,

521
00:26:10,994 --> 00:26:12,996
can you hear me?

523
00:26:19,502 --> 00:26:22,505
Listen to the rhythm
of the chimes.

524
00:26:22,505 --> 00:26:25,007
Listen to the rhythm
of my voice.

525
00:26:25,008 --> 00:26:26,509
You are going

526
00:26:26,509 --> 00:26:28,010
into the deepest part
of your sleep.

527
00:26:28,011 --> 00:26:31,514
Deeper and deeper
and deeper and deeper.

528
00:26:31,514 --> 00:26:34,016
Deeper, deeper.

529
00:26:34,017 --> 00:26:37,020
Now your subconscious
belongs to me.

530
00:26:43,526 --> 00:26:45,528
Open your eyes.

531
00:26:51,034 --> 00:26:54,037
IN THE INNERMOST
REACHES OF YOUR HEART,

532
00:26:54,037 --> 00:26:56,539
YOU ARE A TIGER.

533
00:26:56,539 --> 00:26:58,541
TIGER!

534
00:26:58,541 --> 00:27:01,043
YOU ARE CAPABLE
OF GREAT FEATS

535
00:27:01,044 --> 00:27:03,046
OF STRENGTH
AND COURAGE.

536
00:27:03,046 --> 00:27:06,549
STRENGTH AND COURAGE!

537
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:09,552

00:27:09,552 --> 00:27:12,555
YOU WILL WIN
THE CHAMPIONSHIP.

539
00:27:12,555 --> 00:27:14,557
OHH--

I WILL?

541
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:18,561
YES.

542
00:27:18,561 --> 00:27:20,062
OUT OF SIGHT!

543
00:27:21,564 --> 00:27:23,566
TOMORROW AT YOUR
SPARRING SESSION,

544
00:27:23,566 --> 00:27:25,568
YOU WILL DEMONSTRATE
ALL THE POWER

545
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,569
YOU ARE CAPABLE OF,

546
00:27:26,569 --> 00:27:28,070
AND ON THE NIGHT
OF THE FIGHT,

547
00:27:28,071 --> 00:27:30,573

WIN!

552
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:38,080

WIN!

554
00:27:39,582 --> 00:27:42,585
DOWNRIGHT NASTY
WITH STRENGTH!

555
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,592
NOW...

556
00:27:49,592 --> 00:27:51,093
GO TO SLEEP.

557
00:27:54,597 --> 00:27:56,599
Go to sleep.

558
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:59,101
Sleep, sleep.

559
00:27:59,102 --> 00:28:02,605
Sleep, sleep.

560
00:28:05,108 --> 00:28:08,111
Win, win.

561
00:28:08,111 --> 00:28:10,113
Win, win.

563
00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:08,170
What are we gonna do?

564
00:29:08,171 --> 00:29:10,173
The fire escape.

565
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,721
What are we
gonna do?

566
00:29:58,721 --> 00:30:00,723
You can't
go down there.

567
00:30:05,728 --> 00:30:07,229
What you gonna do?

568
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,232
We're gonna put knots
in these sheets,

569
00:30:09,232 --> 00:30:10,233
throw 'em out
the window,

570
00:30:10,233 --> 00:30:13,236
and climb down.

571
00:30:13,236 --> 00:30:14,737
You're crazy!

572
00:30:14,737 --> 00:30:16,739
We can't go down there
on these!

573
00:30:16,739 --> 00:30:18,741
Are you crazy?
Do you know

574
00:30:18,741 --> 00:30:19,742
what they'll
do to us

575
00:30:19,742 --> 00:30:21,744
if they catch us?

577
00:32:14,357 --> 00:32:16,859
KEEP MOVING, FOOL!

578
00:32:49,725 --> 00:32:52,227
WOULD YOU GET YOUR FOOT
OUT THE WAY?

579
00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:25,761
AAH!

583
00:34:09,305 --> 00:34:10,806
OH!

585
00:34:12,808 --> 00:34:15,310
AHH.
OHH.

586
00:34:26,322 --> 00:34:27,323
OH, YEAH.

587
00:34:31,827 --> 00:34:32,828
HEH.

588
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,331
OH, BOY.

589
00:34:40,836 --> 00:34:41,837

590
00:35:26,382 --> 00:35:28,884
MMM. OHH.

00:35:32,388 --> 00:35:33,389
OOH.

593
00:35:55,911 --> 00:35:56,912
AHA!

594
00:35:56,912 --> 00:35:57,913
WHO ARE YOU?

595
00:35:57,913 --> 00:35:59,414
JUST AS I THOUGHT!
WHO AM I?

596
00:35:59,415 --> 00:36:01,917
DO YOU REALIZE HOW MANY
RULES YOU'VE BROKEN

597
00:36:01,917 --> 00:36:03,919
REGARDING A SINGLE
OCCUPANCY ROOM

598
00:36:03,919 --> 00:36:05,921
IN THE STATE
OF LOUISIANA?

599
00:36:05,921 --> 00:36:07,422
DO YOU REALIZE

600
00:36:07,423 --> 00:36:09,425
HOW MANY LAWS
YOU'VE BROKEN, SIR,

601
00:36:09,425 --> 00:36:11,427
SINCE YOU'VE
ENTERED THIS ROOM?

602
00:36:11,427 --> 00:36:12,928
WHO ARE YOU?

603
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,429
WHO AM I?

604
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,933
WHO AM I? HA!

READ HIM HIS RIGHTS.

609
00:36:30,946 --> 00:36:31,947
HIS RIGHTS?

610
00:36:31,947 --> 00:36:32,948
YES, THE RIGHTS!

611
00:36:32,948 --> 00:36:34,449
RIGHTS. UH--AHEM.

612
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:37,453
ANYTHING YOU SAY MAY
BE HELD AGAINST YOU.

613
00:36:37,453 --> 00:36:38,454
Billy:
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER

614
00:36:38,454 --> 00:36:41,457
BECAUSE WE'VE
GOT ENOUGH AGAINST YOU.

615
00:36:41,457 --> 00:36:44,460
NOW, YOU, YOUNG LADY,

616
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,461

00:36:56,472 --> 00:36:58,474
AHA. OK.

626
00:37:02,478 --> 00:37:04,980
IT'S GONNA REALLY
BE HEAVY ON YOU.

00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,481
NOW, WHAT DO YOU DO

639
00:37:31,006 --> 00:37:32,507
WAIT A MINUTE NOW.

00:37:35,511 --> 00:37:37,513
OH, NO. I DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN.

643
00:37:37,513 --> 00:37:40,015
WE HAVE TO GO DOWN

644
00:37:40,015 --> 00:37:41,016
NO, NO, NO.

650
00:37:50,526 --> 00:37:52,027
I KNEW HE WAS HIP.

671
00:39:40,469 --> 00:39:41,970
NO VIOLENCE.

672
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:45,473
BUT IF MACK AND HIS BOYS
PROVE, UH, STUBBORN,

673
00:39:45,474 --> 00:39:47,476
THEN WHAT HAS TO BE

THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN.

675
00:39:49,478 --> 00:39:51,980
AND IF YOU'RE AS GOOD
AS YOUR REPUTATIONS,

676
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,482
THEN WE CAN LOOK FORWARD
TO A SMOOTH TRANSITION.

678
00:39:55,484 --> 00:39:56,485
COME IN.

679
00:40:07,496 --> 00:40:08,497
EXCUSE ME.

ABOUT PLACING A BET.

691
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:24,072
TELL HIM THIS IS A RESTAURANT,
NOT A BOOKIE JOINT.

692
00:41:24,072 --> 00:41:26,074
I DID.
HE SAID BIG MONEY.

693
00:41:27,576 --> 00:41:29,578
OK, LET'S SEE

WHY DON'T YOU TAKE IT

AIN'T NONE OF THEM
GONNA TAKE YOUR BET

705
00:42:18,126 --> 00:42:19,627

01:00:35,056 --> 01:00:36,557
JUST A FEW
MINOR DETAILS

1009
01:00:36,557 --> 01:00:38,559
FOR PRELIMINARY
PURPOSES.

1010
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:39,560
BUT I WAS WONDERING

1011
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,061
IF I MIGHT BORROW
YOUR TREASURER

1012
01:00:41,062 --> 01:00:42,063
TO DISCUSS THIS MATTER
IN PRIVATE.

1013
01:00:42,063 --> 01:00:44,065
YOU KNOW,
ALL THE BORING DETAILS.

1014
01:00:44,065 --> 01:00:45,566
WELL, I THINK THAT
WOULD BE JUST FINE.

1015
01:00:47,068 --> 01:00:48,569
NOW, UH, I'D LIKE
TO GO WITH YOU MYSELF,

1016
01:00:48,569 --> 01:00:50,571
BUT MY PLACE
IS DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW.

1017
01:00:50,571 --> 01:00:52,072
BUT WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
BROTHER WILLIAMS ALONG

1018
01:00:52,073 --> 01:00:53,574
AS MY PROXY?

1019
01:00:53,574 --> 01:00:57,578
OOH, I WAS JUST GONNA ASK YOU
IF THAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE.

1020
01:00:57,578 --> 01:00:58,579
OF COURSE IT'S POSSIBLE.

1021
01:00:58,579 --> 01:01:00,581
NOW, BETH AND DEE DEE,
SHOW THESE KIND GENTLEMEN

1022
01:01:00,581 --> 01:01:02,082
RIGHT UP TO MY OFFICE.

1023
01:01:02,083 --> 01:01:03,584
WE'LL JUST
BE A MINUTE.

1024
01:01:03,584 --> 01:01:06,086
US BREAKERS DON'T TAKE
TOO LONG TO DO NOTHING.

1025
01:01:06,087 --> 01:01:07,088
WON'T YOU
FOLLOW ME, PLEASE?

1027
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:23,771
WELL, WE'LL SEE Y'ALL

1028
01:01:23,771 --> 01:01:25,272
WHEN YOU GET
DOWNSTAIRS, HEAR?

1029
01:01:26,774 --> 01:01:29,276
BYE, BABY.

1030
01:01:32,279 --> 01:01:33,780
I'M GONNA KILL 'EM!

1031
01:01:33,781 --> 01:01:35,282
OH, WAIT!
WAIT A MINUTE!

1032
01:01:35,282 --> 01:01:37,284
WAIT! WAIT!

1033
01:01:37,284 --> 01:01:39,286
WAIT!
WAIT A MINUTE!

1034
01:01:39,286 --> 01:01:41,288
WAIT! WAIT!

1035
01:01:41,288 --> 01:01:42,289
NOT NOW,
BUBBLETOP.

1036
01:01:42,289 --> 01:01:43,790
NOT HERE.

1037
01:01:43,791 --> 01:01:45,292
I'LL MURDERIZE 'EM!

1038
01:01:45,292 --> 01:01:46,293
I'M GONNA LET YOU
HAVE 'EM, BUBBLETOP.

1039
01:01:46,293 --> 01:01:47,294
YOU CAN PICK 'EM
CLEAN,

1040
01:01:47,294 --> 01:01:48,295
BUT FIRST WE TALK.

1041
01:01:48,295 --> 01:01:50,297
DISHONEST CROOKS.
HYPOCRITSITS.

1042
01:01:50,297 --> 01:01:53,300
YOU MADE FOOLS OF US,
MR. MONGO SLADE.

1043
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:55,302
YOU WON A SMALL VICTORY,
BUT YOU GONNA LOSE THE WAR.

1044
01:01:55,302 --> 01:01:56,803
YOUR WIVES
GONNA BE WIDOWS

1045
01:01:56,804 --> 01:01:57,805
AND YOUR LODGE GONNA BE
MARCHING BACK AND FORTH

1046
01:01:57,805 --> 01:01:59,306
TO THE CEMETERY.

1047
01:01:59,306 --> 01:02:00,807
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

1048
01:02:00,808 --> 01:02:02,810
I'M TALKING ABOUT
FARNSWORTH'S HYPNOSIS

1049
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:04,311
AND 10 GRAND
AT 5-TO-1.

1050
01:02:04,311 --> 01:02:08,315
HYPNOSIS? WE DON'T KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT NO HYPNOSIS.

1051
01:02:08,315 --> 01:02:09,816
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT HYPNOSIS?

1052
01:02:09,817 --> 01:02:11,819
NO, WE DON'T KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT NO HYPNOSIS.

1053
01:02:11,819 --> 01:02:13,320
BUBBLETOP KNOWS
ABOUT HYPNOSIS.

1054
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,822
WANT HIM TO SHOW YOU
WHAT HE KNOWS ABOUT IT?

1055
01:02:15,823 --> 01:02:16,824
NO!
NO!

1056
01:02:16,824 --> 01:02:18,826
NO, NO, NO, NO.
WE--WE--

1057
01:02:18,826 --> 01:02:21,328
WE KNOW A LITTLE
ABOUT HYPNOSIS.

1058
01:02:21,328 --> 01:02:22,829
JUST A LITTLE.

1059
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:24,331
YOU PUT THE WHAMMY
ON FARNSWORTH,

1060
01:02:24,331 --> 01:02:25,332
MADE HIM THINK
HE WAS SUPERMAN.

1061
01:02:25,332 --> 01:02:27,334
THEN YOU PUT THE BITE
ON US AND DISAPPEARED.

1062
01:02:27,334 --> 01:02:28,835
TOOK A WHILE
TO FIGURE IT OUT

1063
01:02:28,836 --> 01:02:29,837
AND A WHILE LONGER
TO FIND YOU,

1064
01:02:29,837 --> 01:02:31,338
BUT WE GOT
YOUR ASSES NOW.

1065
01:02:35,843 --> 01:02:37,344
WHAT YOU LOOKING
AT ME LIKE THAT FOR?

1066
01:02:37,344 --> 01:02:39,346
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT PUT
THE WHAMMY ON FARNSWORTH--

1067
01:02:39,346 --> 01:02:40,847
DON'T YOU LOOK AT ME
LIKE THAT.

1068
01:02:45,352 --> 01:02:46,353
AND DON'T LOOK AT NONE
OF MY BOYS, NEITHER.

1069
01:02:46,353 --> 01:02:47,854
LOOK AT HIM.

1070
01:02:49,356 --> 01:02:51,858
ANY OF YOU GUYS
FEEL SLEEPY?

1071
01:03:06,874 --> 01:03:08,375
NOW CUT THAT OUT!

1072
01:03:08,375 --> 01:03:09,376
WHERE'D YOU LEARN
TO PUT THE WHAMMY

1073
01:03:09,376 --> 01:03:10,377
ON PEOPLE LIKE THAT?

1074
01:03:10,377 --> 01:03:12,879
IN THE ARMY.
MEDICAL CORP.

1075
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,381
WELL, BUBBLETOP
GONNA PUT BOTH Y'ALL

1076
01:03:14,381 --> 01:03:15,882
TO SLEEP SOON ENOUGH
IF YOU DON'T JUMP

1077
01:03:15,883 --> 01:03:17,384
AT THIS PROPOSITION
I'M GONNA LAY ON YOU.

1078
01:03:17,384 --> 01:03:19,386
PROPOSITION?

1079
01:03:22,389 --> 01:03:24,391
WHAT--
WHAT PROPOSITION?

1080
01:03:26,894 --> 01:03:28,896
ONE THAT
WILL GET OUR MONEY BACK

1081
01:03:28,896 --> 01:03:30,898
AND AT THE SAME TIME
WE WIPE OUT BIGGIE SMALLS,

1082
01:03:30,898 --> 01:03:33,901
PUT HIM OUT
OF BUSINESS FOR GOOD.

1083
01:03:33,901 --> 01:03:35,402
THE REMATCH
BETWEEN FARNSWORTH

1084
01:03:35,402 --> 01:03:36,903
AND 40th STREET BLACK
IS COMING UP

1085
01:03:36,904 --> 01:03:38,906
ONE WEEK FROM TONIGHT.

1086
01:03:38,906 --> 01:03:40,908
THE 6 OF US IN THIS ROOM
ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE

1087
01:03:40,908 --> 01:03:42,409
IN THE WORLD THAT KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME.

1088
01:03:42,409 --> 01:03:44,411
NOT FARNSWORTH
NOR ANY OF HIS PEOPLE

1089
01:03:44,411 --> 01:03:46,413
HAVE THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
WHAT WENT DOWN.

1090
01:03:46,413 --> 01:03:47,414
QUIET AS IT'S KEPT,

1091
01:03:47,414 --> 01:03:48,915
FARNSWORTH
IS HIS OLD SELF AGAIN.

1092
01:03:48,916 --> 01:03:50,417
HIS SPARRING PARTNERS

1093
01:03:50,417 --> 01:03:51,418
ARE KNOCKIN' HIM
AROUND THE RING.

1094
01:03:51,418 --> 01:03:52,919
HE LOST THAT CONFIDENCE
YOU GAVE HIM,

1095
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:53,921
AND NOW HIS PUNCHES
CAN'T BREAK AN EGG.

1096
01:03:53,921 --> 01:03:54,922
SO?

1097
01:03:54,922 --> 01:03:56,423
SO YOU COME
BACK TO ORLEANS

1098
01:03:56,423 --> 01:03:57,924
AND HYPNOTIZE
FARNSWORTH AGAIN

1099
01:03:57,925 --> 01:04:00,928
3 DAYS BEFORE THE FIGHT
SO THE WHOLE WORLD CAN SEE

1100
01:04:00,928 --> 01:04:02,429
THAT HE IS BACK
IN WINNING CONDITION

1101
01:04:02,429 --> 01:04:04,431
AND EVERYBODY
WILL WANT TO BET ON HIM.

1102
01:04:04,431 --> 01:04:06,433
ME AND MY BOYS
WILL COVER THOSE BETS.

1103
01:04:06,433 --> 01:04:07,934
THEN ON THE MORNING
OF THE FIGHT,

1104
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,436
YOU WILL DEHYPNOTIZE
FARNSWORTH

1105
01:04:09,436 --> 01:04:10,937
SO WHEN HE CLIMBS
IN THAT RING,

1106
01:04:10,938 --> 01:04:12,940
HE'LL BE HIS OLD,
SCARED SELF AGAIN.

1107
01:04:14,441 --> 01:04:16,943
AFTER THE FIGHT,
WE'LL BE EVEN

1108
01:04:16,944 --> 01:04:18,445
AND YOU'LL
BE FREE TO GO.

1109
01:04:19,947 --> 01:04:21,949
WELL, HOW DO WE KNOW
WE CAN TRUST YOU?

1110
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:25,452
I TRUST YOU.

1111
01:04:25,452 --> 01:04:27,454
ME, TOO.
ME, TOO.

1112
01:04:27,454 --> 01:04:28,455
SO WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

1113
01:04:28,455 --> 01:04:29,956
YOU COMING
BACK TO ORLEANS

1114
01:04:29,957 --> 01:04:30,958
OR YOU GONNA ASK
THE GRAND SUPREME

1115
01:04:30,958 --> 01:04:32,459
TO MAKE OUT YOUR
FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS?

1116
01:04:32,459 --> 01:04:33,960
WELL, I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED
GOING TO NEW ORLEANS.

1117
01:04:33,961 --> 01:04:35,963
I'D--I'D RATHER GO--

1118
01:04:35,963 --> 01:04:36,964
I'D RATHER GO
TO NEW ORLEANS...

1119
01:04:36,964 --> 01:04:38,465
THAN THE CEMETERY.

1121
01:04:46,473 --> 01:04:47,474
MMM.

1122
01:04:47,474 --> 01:04:49,976
MMM.

1123
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:31,352
WELL, WELL, WELL.
MONGO SLADE.

1124
01:05:32,853 --> 01:05:34,354
WHAT CAN
I DO FOR YOU?

1125
01:05:34,355 --> 01:05:35,856
I WANT TO PLACE
A BET ON THE FIGHT.

1126
01:05:37,858 --> 01:05:39,860
NO KIDDING.

1127
01:05:41,362 --> 01:05:42,863
HOW MUCH OF A BET?

1128
01:05:42,863 --> 01:05:44,865
50,000.

1129
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:50,871
ON WHO?

1130
01:05:56,877 --> 01:06:00,380
BOOTNEY
FARNSWORTH.

1131
01:06:00,381 --> 01:06:02,883
YOU KNOW LIGHTNING DOESN'T
STRIKE THE SAME PLACE TWICE?

1132
01:06:02,883 --> 01:06:04,384
SAYS WHO?

1134
01:06:08,389 --> 01:06:10,391
UH, LOOK.

1135
01:06:10,391 --> 01:06:11,892
EXCUSE ME A MINUTE.

1136
01:06:11,892 --> 01:06:13,894
I GOTTA DISCUSS
WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE

1137
01:06:13,894 --> 01:06:16,897
BEFORE I CAN OK
A BET OF SUCH MAGNITUDE.

1138
01:06:16,897 --> 01:06:19,900
YOU UNDERSTAND,
DON'T YOU?

1139
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:22,402
BROTHER.

1140
01:06:22,403 --> 01:06:24,905
TAKE
YOUR TIME...

1141
01:06:24,905 --> 01:06:25,906
BROTHER.

1143
01:06:40,421 --> 01:06:42,423
THE LAST TIME THAT
CHUMP WAS IN HERE,

1144
01:06:42,423 --> 01:06:44,925
HE BURNED US GOOD.

1145
01:06:44,925 --> 01:06:46,426
HE KNOWS SOMETHING.
I CAN FEEL IT!

1146
01:06:46,427 --> 01:06:48,929
YEAH,
ME, TOO, BOSS.

1147
01:06:48,929 --> 01:06:49,930
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO STALL HIM

1148
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:51,431
FOR A COUPLE
OF DAYS.

1149
01:06:54,435 --> 01:06:56,937
AND LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT FARNSWORTH,

1150
01:06:56,937 --> 01:06:57,938
SEE IF
WE CAN GET SOME KIND

1151
01:06:57,938 --> 01:06:59,940
OF LINE ON HIM.

1152
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:03,443
BECAUSE IF THAT GUY
KNOWS SOMETHING,

1153
01:07:03,444 --> 01:07:04,945
THERE'S NO REASON
WHY WE SHOULDN'T

1154
01:07:04,945 --> 01:07:05,946
TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF IT, RIGHT?

1155
01:07:05,946 --> 01:07:07,447
RIGHT.

1156
01:07:07,448 --> 01:07:10,451
RIGHT. OPEN IT.

1157
01:07:17,958 --> 01:07:20,460
MONGO, I SUSPECT
WE CAN COVER YOUR BET,

1158
01:07:20,461 --> 01:07:21,962
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GIVE US A COUPLE OF DAYS

1159
01:07:21,962 --> 01:07:23,964
WHILE I GET SOME EXTRA CASH
IN FROM OUT OF TOWN.

1160
01:07:23,964 --> 01:07:24,965
JUST SO LONG
AS YOU'LL COVER ME

1161
01:07:24,965 --> 01:07:26,466
BEFORE FIGHT TIME,
BIGGIE.

1162
01:07:26,467 --> 01:07:28,469
OH, NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

1163
01:07:28,469 --> 01:07:31,472
IN THAT CASE,
I'LL EASE ON.

1166
01:08:07,007 --> 01:08:08,508
WELL, IF IT AIN'T
SHUFF-ALONG MACK

1167
01:08:08,509 --> 01:08:10,010
AND HIS
OLD-TIME DARKIES.

1168
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:13,513
BIGGIE SMALLS.

1169
01:08:17,017 --> 01:08:19,019
YOUR MAMA STILL WORKING
IN THEM $10 HOUSES?

1170
01:08:19,019 --> 01:08:21,521
SOME OTHER TIME.

1171
01:08:21,522 --> 01:08:23,524
SOME OTHER TIME.

1172
01:08:23,524 --> 01:08:25,025
ONE OF THESE DAYS,
I'M GONNA CLIMB

1173
01:08:25,025 --> 01:08:26,026
ALL OVER YOU.

1175
01:08:28,529 --> 01:08:30,531
IT'LL TAKE MORE GUTS
THAN YOU'VE GOT, BIGGIE.

1176
01:08:30,531 --> 01:08:32,032
YOU GOT TO BRING ASS
TO GET ASS.

1177
01:08:32,032 --> 01:08:34,034
YOU'RE COLORFUL,
MACK.

1178
01:08:34,034 --> 01:08:37,537
DUMB, OLD-FASHIONED,
AND OUT OF STYLE,

1179
01:08:37,538 --> 01:08:39,039
BUT COLORFUL.

1180
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:40,040
BIGGIE, YOU
OUT OF YOUR TERRITORY,

1181
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,542
AND I DON'T LIKE IT
WHEN PEOPLE COME INTO MY TOWN

1182
01:08:42,543 --> 01:08:44,044
WITHOUT
PAYING THEIR RESPECT.

1183
01:08:44,044 --> 01:08:45,545
WELL, WE NO LONGER
CONSIDER THIS TOWN

1184
01:08:45,546 --> 01:08:47,548
AS OUT
OF OUR TERRITORY.

1185
01:08:47,548 --> 01:08:48,549
WATCH YOUR MOUTH, SON.

1186

IN FACT, I'VE BROUGHT YOU
A MESSAGE FROM THE BOYS

1187

IN KENTUCKY AND ALABAMA.

1188
01:08:51,552 --> 01:08:54,054
THEY SAY YOU RUN THIS TOWN
LIKE A SISSY

1189
01:08:54,054 --> 01:08:56,556
AND THEY THINK YOU OUGHT

1336
01:19:40,867 --> 01:19:44,871
YES. WELL.
UH, YOU SEE,

1337
01:19:44,871 --> 01:19:45,872
WHEN WE FIRST
ARRIVED HERE,

1338
01:19:45,872 --> 01:19:49,375
WE CAME UP TO SEE
THE CHAMP LEGITIMATELY.

1339
01:19:49,375 --> 01:19:50,376
CAME UP AND WE SAID

1340
01:19:50,376 --> 01:19:51,877
WE'D LIKE
TO SEE THE CHAMP.

1341
01:19:51,878 --> 01:19:53,379
NOW, PEOPLE SAID
YOU CANNOT SEE THE CHAMP

1342
01:19:53,379 --> 01:19:55,381
THE DAY
BEFORE THE FIGHT.

1343
01:19:55,381 --> 01:19:58,384
SO, MY FRIEND AND I
TOOK IT UPON OURSELVES

1344
01:19:58,384 --> 01:20:00,386
TO COME OUT ON LEDGES
AND DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS,

1345
01:20:00,386 --> 01:20:02,888
MAINLY BECAUSE
IN OUR HOMETOWN

1346
01:20:02,889 --> 01:20:04,390
OF POSSUM'S PAW,
ALABAMA,

1347
01:20:04,390 --> 01:20:06,892
WHICH IS THE CHAMP'S
HOMETOWN ALSO,

1348
01:20:06,893 --> 01:20:09,395
THERE IS AN ORPHANAGE.

1349
01:20:09,395 --> 01:20:13,399
NOW, THIS ORPHANAGE
HAS REAL ORPHANS.

1350
01:20:13,399 --> 01:20:16,402
I MEAN, THESE KIDS,

1351
01:20:16,402 --> 01:20:18,904
THEY DON'T
EVEN HAVE...THINGS.

1352
01:20:18,905 --> 01:20:22,408
SOME OF 'EM WE DON'T KNOW
WHERE THEY CAME FROM.

1353
01:20:22,408 --> 01:20:25,411
WE GOT, UH,
ONE GREEN ONE.

1354
01:20:26,913 --> 01:20:28,414
POOR CHILD.

1355
01:20:28,414 --> 01:20:30,916
AND HE LOVES THE CHAMP
MORE THAN ANYBODY

1356
01:20:30,917 --> 01:20:33,920
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE
ANYONE TO IDENTIFY WITH.

1357
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:36,422
BUT IF YOU SAY
THE CHAMP'S NAME,

1358
01:20:36,422 --> 01:20:38,924
WHY, THEY START ACTING

1359
01:20:38,925 --> 01:20:40,426
JUST LIKE
THEY HAD REAL PARENTS

1360
01:20:40,426 --> 01:20:42,428
AND THEY'RE
RUNNING AROUND

1361
01:20:42,428 --> 01:20:43,929
WRITING THEIR NAMES
ON THE WALLS.

1362
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:47,934
WE DECIDED TO TAKE IT
UPON OURSELVES

1363
01:20:47,934 --> 01:20:51,437
TO COME IN
THROUGH THE WINDOW...

1364
01:20:51,437 --> 01:20:53,939
TO TRY
TO GET TO THE CHAMP

1365
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:58,945
TO SEE IF THERE'S SOME WAY
THAT WE COULD SING THE SONG.

1367
01:21:00,446 --> 01:21:01,447
SO WE'D LIKE
TO SING IT FOR YOU

1368
01:21:01,447 --> 01:21:03,949
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT.

CALL THE POLICE.

1382
01:21:44,857 --> 01:21:46,358
NOW, WHAT THE HELL'S
THE SENSE OF TALKING

1383
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:48,361
ABOUT BUILDING
A RECREATION CENTER

1384
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:49,362
FOR THIS AREA

1385
01:21:49,362 --> 01:21:50,863
WHEN OUR COMMUNITY
RELATIONS TEAM

1386
01:21:50,863 --> 01:21:52,865
SITS ON THEIR FAT ASSES
AND BLOWS STEAM?

1387
01:21:52,865 --> 01:21:55,367
$2,500 IN 6 MONTHS.

1388
01:21:55,368 --> 01:21:57,370
IS THAT THE BEST
THEY CAN DO?

1389
01:21:57,370 --> 01:21:58,871
NOW YOU TELL 'EM
TO GET OFF THEIR TAILS

1390
01:21:58,871 --> 01:22:00,873
AND GET OUT IN THE COMMUNITY
AND RELATE.

1391
01:22:00,873 --> 01:22:02,374
TELL 'EM I WANT
TO SEE SOME IMPROVEMENTS

1392
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:03,876
OR I'M GONNA
HAVE THEIR HEADS!

1393
01:22:03,876 --> 01:22:06,378
NOW, GO AHEAD.

1394
01:22:09,382 --> 01:22:11,884
OPEN IT UP.

1396
01:22:18,891 --> 01:22:20,392
MY NAME IS
LIEUTENANT BOTTOMLEY,

1397
01:22:20,393 --> 01:22:21,894
27th PRECINCT.

1398
01:22:21,894 --> 01:22:23,395
WE GOT YOU HERE
ON A VARIETY OF CHARGES.

1399
01:22:23,396 --> 01:22:24,897
YOU HAVE?

1400
01:22:24,897 --> 01:22:26,899
BREAKING AND ENTERING.
CRIMINAL TRESPASS.

1401
01:22:26,899 --> 01:22:28,400
CRIMINAL MISCHIEF.
BURGLARY.

1402
01:22:28,401 --> 01:22:30,903
ATTEMPTED LARCENY.
ATTEMPTED MURDER.

1403
01:22:30,903 --> 01:22:33,405
IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT
YOUR INTENTIONS WERE

1404
01:22:33,406 --> 01:22:34,407
TO FARNSWORTH.

1405
01:22:34,407 --> 01:22:35,908
BUT WE DIDN'T TRY
TO MURDER ANYBODY.

1406
01:22:35,908 --> 01:22:37,409
WE WOULDN'T
HURT A FLY.

1407
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:38,911
THEN JUST WHAT WERE
YOU DOING THERE?

1408
01:22:38,911 --> 01:22:42,414
WELL, SEE, WE'RE
FROM THE CHAMP'S HOMETOWN,

1409
01:22:42,415 --> 01:22:43,416
BILLY AND ME,
AND WE CAME UP

1410
01:22:43,416 --> 01:22:44,417
TO SING HIM A SONG

1411
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:46,419
THAT WE SPECIALLY
COMPOSED FOR HIM.

1412
01:22:46,419 --> 01:22:50,923
AND, UH, I HAD TO HAVE
THE RIGHT VOCAL PITCH

1413
01:22:50,923 --> 01:22:54,426
IN ORDER TO GET
THE RIGHT VOCAL LEVEL.

1414
01:22:54,427 --> 01:22:56,429
I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND.

1415
01:22:56,429 --> 01:22:58,931
JUST LISTEN

1416
01:22:58,931 --> 01:22:59,932
TO THE SOUND
OF THE CHARM.

1417
01:22:59,932 --> 01:23:03,936
JUST LISTEN.
LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN.

1418
01:23:03,936 --> 01:23:05,938
LISTEN...LISTEN...

1420
01:23:26,459 --> 01:23:27,960
WELL, WE
GOT OUT OF THAT.

1421
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:28,961
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN "WE"?

1422
01:23:28,961 --> 01:23:30,462
I GOT US
OUT OF THAT FIX.

1423
01:23:30,463 --> 01:23:31,464
AND FROM NOW ON,

1424
01:23:31,464 --> 01:23:32,965
I'M GONNA DO
THE THINKING.

1425
01:23:32,965 --> 01:23:33,966
ALL ALONG YOU'VE BEEN
TELLING ME WHAT TO DO,

1426
01:23:33,966 --> 01:23:35,467
AND MACK'S BEEN
TELLING ME WHAT--

1427
01:23:35,468 --> 01:23:36,969
WELL, NOW I'M GONNA

1428
01:23:36,969 --> 01:23:40,973
AND I'M GONNA TELL YOU
WHAT TO DO, HUH?

1429
01:23:40,973 --> 01:23:43,475
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

1430
01:23:43,476 --> 01:23:45,978
WELL, SINCE THERE'S NO WAY
TO GET TO FARNSWORTH

1431
01:23:45,978 --> 01:23:47,980
TO DEHYPNOTIZE HIM...

1437
01:25:00,052 --> 01:25:01,053
YEAH?

1438
01:25:01,053 --> 01:25:02,554
EVERYTHING'S
PERFECT AT MY END.

1439
01:25:02,555 --> 01:25:04,056
YOUR MOVE.

1440
01:25:18,571 --> 01:25:20,072
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO WITH IT?

1441
01:25:20,072 --> 01:25:21,573
I'M GONNA INVEST IT.

1442
01:25:21,574 --> 01:25:23,075
Dee Dee:
WITH MR. CLUTCH?

1443
01:25:23,075 --> 01:25:24,576
IN A MANNER
OF SPEAKING, YES.

1444
01:25:24,577 --> 01:25:28,581
NOW, UH, WE NEED YOU,
AND THE LODGE NEEDS YOU,

1445
01:25:28,581 --> 01:25:31,083
MORE THAN EVER BEFORE.

1446
01:25:31,083 --> 01:25:32,584
NOW, I DON'T WANT YOU
ASKING ANY QUESTIONS.

1447
01:25:32,585 --> 01:25:34,587
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET UPSET.

1448
01:25:34,587 --> 01:25:36,088
I WANT YOU
TO LISTEN CAREFULLY.

1449
01:25:36,088 --> 01:25:40,092
WE CANNOT AFFORD
ANY MISTAKES.

1451
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,101
BIGGIE SMALLS?

1452
01:25:49,101 --> 01:25:51,103
WHO WANTS HIM?

1453
01:25:51,103 --> 01:25:52,604
I WANT TO MAKE A BET
ON THE FIGHT.

1454
01:25:52,605 --> 01:25:54,106
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE TAKES BETS ON FIGHTS?

1455
01:25:54,106 --> 01:25:55,107
WELL, IF HE DON'T,

1456
01:25:55,107 --> 01:25:57,609
I GUESS I'LL JUST
HAVE TO TAKE MY $5,000

1457
01:25:57,610 --> 01:26:01,614
AND GO SOMEPLACE ELSE,
NOW, WON'T I?

1458
01:26:19,632 --> 01:26:22,134
WELL, WHO IS
BIGGIE SMALLS?

1459
01:26:22,134 --> 01:26:24,636
YOU DO YOUR BUSINESS
WITH ME FOR THE TIME BEING.

1460
01:26:24,637 --> 01:26:26,138
WHERE'S YOUR $5,000?

1461
01:26:30,643 --> 01:26:31,644
ON WHO?

1462
01:26:31,644 --> 01:26:34,146
IT'S RIGHT THERE
ON THE PAPER.

01:26:36,649 --> 01:26:37,650
YOU SERIOUS?

1464
01:26:37,650 --> 01:26:39,151
IS THERE SALT
IN THE SEA?

1465
01:26:39,151 --> 01:26:40,652
DOES HONEY COME
FROM A BEE?

1466
01:26:40,653 --> 01:26:42,655
YOU BET YOUR ASS
I'M SERIOUS.

1467
01:26:52,164 --> 01:26:53,665
YOU SURE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING, LADY?

1468
01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:55,668

1470
01:26:57,670 --> 01:26:59,672

1479
01:27:18,691 --> 01:27:19,692

1490
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:19,251

SHE'S GOT THE MONEY THERE?

1495

01:47:26,698 --> 01:47:29,701
AND I SAY TO YOU,

1678
01:47:29,701 --> 01:47:32,203
THAT MacARTHUR CLUTCH...

1679
01:47:33,705 --> 01:47:38,209
AND HIAWATHA SMALLS--

1680
01:47:38,209 --> 01:47:40,211
HIAWATHA. HMM.

1681
01:47:42,213 --> 01:47:46,217
WHEN THEY HEARD
ABOUT THE POLICE

1682
01:47:46,217 --> 01:47:48,219
COMMUNITY
RELATIONS TEAM

1683
01:47:48,219 --> 01:47:50,221
TRYING TO GET MONEY

1684
01:47:50,221 --> 01:47:53,224
TO AID
THE RECREATION FUND

1685
01:47:53,224 --> 01:47:55,726
FOR THE LITTLE
SLUM KIDS,

1686
01:47:55,727 --> 01:48:00,732
IT BROUGHT TEARS
TO THEIR EYES.

1687
01:48:00,732 --> 01:48:02,734
THEY SHED TEARS.

1688
01:48:02,734 --> 01:48:04,235
TEARS!

1689
01:48:06,237 --> 01:48:08,739
HA HA! AND SO
WHEN THEY HEARD ABOUT IT,

1690
01:48:08,740 --> 01:48:10,742
THEY CAME RUNNING FORTH,

1691
01:48:10,742 --> 01:48:13,745
THROUGH A DOOR THAT THEY
DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT.

1692
01:48:13,745 --> 01:48:15,747
JUST CAME RUNNING!

1693
01:48:15,747 --> 01:48:18,249
AND YOU SAW THEM.
THEY WERE EXCITED,

1694
01:48:18,249 --> 01:48:19,750
LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN.

1695
01:48:19,751 --> 01:48:21,252
OH, HO, HO, WE DON'T
KNOW WHERE WE ARE.

1696
01:48:21,252 --> 01:48:22,753
WE DON'T KNOW WHO WE ARE
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

1697
01:48:22,754 --> 01:48:25,256
AND THEY PLEAD THE FIFTH
'CAUSE THEY'RE GANGSTERS!

1698
01:48:25,256 --> 01:48:26,257
AND THAT'S WHY
THEY LOOKED FUNNY

1699
01:48:26,257 --> 01:48:27,258
WHEN THEY RAN IN HERE.

1700
01:48:27,258 --> 01:48:30,261
DIDN'T DO IT ON PURPOSE.

1701
01:48:30,261 --> 01:48:33,264
THEY WANTED TO HELP.

1702
01:48:33,264 --> 01:48:36,767
AND SO THAT'S
WHY THEY'RE HERE--

1703
01:48:36,768 --> 01:48:40,772
TO AID
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.

1704
01:48:42,774 --> 01:48:47,278

IT SURE WOULD BE.

1727
01:49:41,833 --> 01:49:43,334
I MEAN, THAT WOULD MEAN
LIEUTENANT BOTTOMLEY

1728
01:49:43,334 --> 01:49:44,335
WOULD HAVE
TO OPEN THAT ENVELOPE

01:49:44,335 --> 01:49:45,836
WITH ALL THAT EVIDENCE.

1730

YES. I HAVE AN ENVELOPE

1754
01:51:00,078 --> 01:51:02,080
IF YOU HAD

BETWEEN MUHAMMAD ALI
AND SAMMY DAVIS JR.,

1756
01:51:05,083 --> 01:51:07,085
HOW MUCH YOU THINK
THEY'D DRAW?

1773
01:51:46,124 --> 01:51:47,125
THAT'D BE THE END
OF THE FIGHT.

1774
01:51:47,125 --> 01:51:49,627
