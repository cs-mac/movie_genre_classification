1
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:34,559
<i>All my life I've been
in love with Missy McCloud.</i>

2
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:38,229
<i>That's her, back at her
first grade birthday party.</i>

3
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:41,398
<i>Even at the age of six,
Missy was the kind of girl...</i>

4
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:45,409
<i>that everyone just liked
being around, me especially.</i>

5
00:00:45,477 --> 00:00:49,914
<i>That's me in the back, with the
little red fireman's hat on.</i>

6
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:54,077
<i>And that is the most amazing
present in the world.</i>

7
00:00:54,152 --> 00:00:58,747
<i>It took me almost a year
to save up enough to buy it.</i>

8
00:00:58,822 --> 00:01:03,418
<i>And when she opened it, I was sure
she'd fall helplessly in love with me.</i>

9
00:01:03,493 --> 00:01:07,054
<i>- It couldn't fail.
- I love it.</i>

10
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,726
<i>Johnny, don't you have
something for Missy?</i>

11
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:16,203
<i>This was it, my golden moment.</i>

12
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:19,172
<i>In front of everyone, the most
exotic creature alive...</i>

13
00:01:19,241 --> 00:01:22,175
<i>would fall totally in love
with me, forever.</i>

14
00:01:22,243 --> 00:01:25,610
<i>I had the confidence.
I had the gift.</i>

15
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,743
<i>- Well, son?
- But I wimped out.</i>

16
00:01:30,818 --> 00:01:33,081
<i>All right, kids, cake time!</i>

17
00:01:33,153 --> 00:01:35,144
<i>Come on!</i>

18
00:01:39,893 --> 00:01:41,952
What are you
looking at, dirtbag?

19
00:01:42,028 --> 00:01:44,553
Here, honey,
you sit there.

20
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:48,597
<i>Make a wish.</i>

21
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,930
<i>- Happy birthday!
- That's my girl.</i>

22
00:01:51,002 --> 00:01:55,098
<i>Over the next
12years, I lusted after Missy.</i>

23
00:01:55,173 --> 00:01:57,266
<i>She filled out
in all the right places...</i>

24
00:01:57,342 --> 00:02:01,369
<i>the ones I'd been reading about
in the National Geographic.</i>

25
00:02:01,446 --> 00:02:05,711
<i>The more she grew up, the more
helplessly in love I became.</i>

26
00:02:05,783 --> 00:02:08,377
<i>That was the problem.</i>

27
00:02:08,452 --> 00:02:12,046
<i>Well, you know what they say:
love makes you do crazy things.</i>

28
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:15,716
<i>Well, my love for Missy drove me
to do the most unimaginable thing...</i>

29
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:20,057
<i>one human being can do to another,
but that comes later.</i>

30
00:02:20,128 --> 00:02:23,564
<i>My story begins at the end of
my senior year in high school...</i>

31
00:02:23,632 --> 00:02:26,897
<i>on the historic day after Missy broke up
with Buck Van Patten...</i>

32
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:29,061
<i>her boyfriend
for the last six years.</i>

33
00:02:29,137 --> 00:02:31,071
<i>I was ecstatic.</i>

34
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,733
<i>This day was the beginning
of the end of my life.</i>

35
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:46,809
Damn right, 7:15.

36
00:02:56,962 --> 00:02:57,986
Huh.

37
00:02:58,063 --> 00:03:00,997
Doom.

38
00:03:08,705 --> 00:03:10,297
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

39
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:12,637
- What's your hurry there, son?
- Today I'm going to ask...

40
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:14,643
the most perfect girl
in the world to the prom.

41
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:17,202
Oh, you're going to ask
your own mother, eh?

42
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,805
Oh, you.

43
00:03:19,883 --> 00:03:22,817
Sit down, honey.
Breakfast is ready.

44
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:25,819
- No time, Mom.
- Always time for a good breakfast.

45
00:03:25,887 --> 00:03:30,221
- You're absolutely right.
- A donut isn't breakfast.

46
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,156
It's fine, Ma.

47
00:03:32,227 --> 00:03:34,991
Where's the vitamin C?
Where's the fiber?

48
00:03:35,063 --> 00:03:36,997
<i>I'll eat on the way.</i>

49
00:03:37,065 --> 00:03:40,659
Well, that way better not take you
across Mrs.Jones's yard, son.

50
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:43,066
We don't want the neighbors
to think ill of us.

51
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:52,507
Hi, Mrs. Smith.

52
00:03:52,578 --> 00:03:54,842
Morning, Johnny.

53
00:03:54,914 --> 00:03:58,280
Morning, Mrs.Jones. Hope
you don't think ill of me.

54
00:04:00,418 --> 00:04:02,249
Oh!

55
00:04:04,523 --> 00:04:06,787
<i>Good morning.</i>

56
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:11,123
Hi.

57
00:04:11,195 --> 00:04:14,288
<i>Hi, Johnny. - Hello.</i>

58
00:04:22,372 --> 00:04:25,000
<i>- Good morning, John.
- Beautiful day!</i>

59
00:04:25,074 --> 00:04:29,976
<i>It certainly is.</i>

60
00:04:55,402 --> 00:04:58,496
<i>Slow it down, Johnny.</i>

61
00:04:58,572 --> 00:05:00,902
- Hi, Mrs. Applebaum.
- Hi, Johnny. How are you?

62
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,948
<i>There she is.</i>

63
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:18,283
<i>That's Missy, all grown up.</i>

64
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:21,347
<i>And that's my friend Eddie.</i>

65
00:05:21,425 --> 00:05:23,790
<i>He's a dick, but I like him.</i>

66
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:28,455
Hey, Missy. I just wanted to say
you look really nice today...

67
00:05:28,531 --> 00:05:33,246
in a physically perfect,
newly available kind of way.

68
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:37,578
- Thanks.
- Extinguish all talking.

69
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,972
<i>Now who can tell me
how heroes are created?</i>

70
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:45,809
- Gerald?
- Th-That's a tricky question.

71
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,815
I don't think heroes are born,
I think they're made.

72
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:55,479
They're normal men faced with
extraordinary circumstances.

73
00:05:55,555 --> 00:06:00,322
My personal hero
is Jane Goodall.

74
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:05,261
When she was born she didn't know
anything about apes and their culture...

75
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,316
<i>but as she grew, she
studied really hard--</i>

76
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:09,436
<i>Hey, Tiger.</i>

77
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:14,267
- You talkin' to me?
- Mm-hmm.

78
00:06:14,338 --> 00:06:19,275
I know that you've been really concerned
lately that you're still a virgin...

79
00:06:19,343 --> 00:06:23,005
and you don't have
a date to the prom.

80
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,317
And that you're
sexually stupid.

81
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:33,447
But those things,
they mean nothing to me.

82
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:37,287
I love you just the way you are.

83
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:40,191
Oh, I see. I'm dreaming.

84
00:06:42,597 --> 00:06:46,192
Johnny! Dingle!

85
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:48,735
<i>We're here at the Fairview gymnasium,
the site of Johnny Dingle's...</i>

86
00:06:48,803 --> 00:06:51,533
<i>most ambitious
sexual challenge to date.</i>

87
00:06:51,606 --> 00:06:53,539
<i>And there's
Johnny Dingle himself...</i>

88
00:06:53,607 --> 00:06:55,905
<i>looking really pumped up
for tonight's event.</i>

89
00:06:55,976 --> 00:06:59,809
<i>The crowd just loves this kid!</i>

90
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,246
<i>It looks like he may go
all the way tonight!</i>

91
00:07:03,315 --> 00:07:06,842
<i>And there he goes!</i>

92
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:08,443
<i>- Oh, and a flag on the play!
- What?</i>

93
00:07:08,521 --> 00:07:11,455
Personal foul.
The challenger, Johnny Dingle...

94
00:07:11,523 --> 00:07:13,616
is not using
a regulation-size unit.

95
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:16,217
<i>He's disqualified!</i>

96
00:07:16,294 --> 00:07:19,593
What do you mean it's not regulation?

97
00:07:19,664 --> 00:07:22,064
This is the most pathetic
sexual fantasy I've ever seen.

98
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:27,332
Say good night, sex boy.

99
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:30,270
No!

100
00:07:33,676 --> 00:07:35,667
Go get her.

101
00:07:35,745 --> 00:07:38,441
<i>Attention, students.
There will be a surprise fire drill...</i>

102
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:40,448
<i>- Missy.
- Yeah?</i>

103
00:07:40,516 --> 00:07:45,543
I, uh, I have something
I want to ask.

104
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,883
Okay, shoot.

105
00:07:51,425 --> 00:07:55,361
- Are you trying to hypnotize me?
- No, no, um.

106
00:07:55,429 --> 00:07:57,555
No, what I want
to ask you is this:

107
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,723
since you're not
seeing Buck anymore...

108
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:02,233
I was wondering if
maybe you'd like to go--

109
00:08:02,302 --> 00:08:06,739
<i>Make way!</i>

110
00:08:08,308 --> 00:08:10,242
Move.
Move!

111
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,244
Buck, what are you doing?
What is this?

112
00:08:14,312 --> 00:08:18,373
- I am so sorry. I'm an idiot.
- Well, no kidding.

113
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:20,610
You stand me up, and then
you don't even call me.

114
00:08:20,685 --> 00:08:22,619
My car broke down.

115
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:25,349
I had to walk eight miles through
the rain to get to a telephone.

116
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:27,279
<i>When I got there, you
were already gone.</i>

117
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:27,991
<i>Really?</i>

118
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:30,152
I would walk on glass...

119
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:32,593
and eat donkeys for you.

120
00:08:32,662 --> 00:08:36,427
I can't live knowing
that you're not mine.

121
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:39,935
Will you go
to the prom with me?

122
00:08:40,002 --> 00:08:42,937
Of course I will, silly.

123
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:46,269
I'm sorry too.
Let's not fight anymore.

124
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:56,582
What's up, Dingle? Nice zit.

125
00:08:56,651 --> 00:08:58,949
See you, Johnny.

126
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:04,547
- What are you lookin' at, dirtbag?
- Nothing.

127
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:12,231
Well, that blew ropy goat
chunks now, didn't it?

128
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:14,232
It's not over.

129
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,895
<i>That's when I came up with the plan
that would change my life forever.</i>

130
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,903
<i>Andit could have worked too.</i>

131
00:09:19,971 --> 00:09:23,805
<i>It was swashbuckling,
romantic, daring.</i>

132
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:27,469
- All right, let me see it. Let me see it.
- This is absurd.

133
00:09:27,545 --> 00:09:32,244
<i>Unfortunately, it depended on Eddie.</i>

134
00:09:32,316 --> 00:09:35,216
All right, give me all your money.

135
00:09:35,285 --> 00:09:38,413
That was it?
That was menacing?

136
00:09:38,488 --> 00:09:40,422
All right, news flash.
This just in, Johnny.

137
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,755
Missy is going to the prom
with Buck. You got it?

138
00:09:43,827 --> 00:09:46,261
Look, you pretend to kill her,
I save her life...

139
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:50,286
she thinks I'm a hero, ditches Buck
and goes to the prom with me.

140
00:09:50,364 --> 00:09:52,594
How sweet is that?

141
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:55,261
This is desperate
and this is sick.

142
00:09:55,336 --> 00:09:58,430
I think you should
get some therapy. I do.

143
00:09:58,506 --> 00:10:02,101
<i>With the steadfast
support of my best friend...</i>

144
00:10:02,176 --> 00:10:04,838
<i>and the cool cunning
of a master tactician...</i>

145
00:10:04,912 --> 00:10:07,778
<i>I swung into action.</i>

146
00:10:22,027 --> 00:10:26,292
- Hi, Johnny.
- Hey, there.

147
00:10:37,975 --> 00:10:41,034
- That it?
- Um--

148
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:46,138
<i>- Anything else?
- Yeah, um, these.</i>

149
00:10:48,584 --> 00:10:51,485
Freeze! Don't move!
Give me your money!

150
00:10:51,554 --> 00:10:54,648
Give me your mon--

151
00:10:56,725 --> 00:10:59,159
Give me your money.
Come on, come on--

152
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,432
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

153
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,102
Uh, nothing.

154
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,943
- Are you gonna rob this store?
- Uh, yes, yes, I was.

155
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,279
But you can rob it if you want.
I can come back tomorrow.

156
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,250
- I can always come back tomorrow.
- Give me your mask.

157
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:32,517
Okay, we have one flyswatter,
one pair of red, fuzzy dice...

158
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:37,289
yellow army tank.

159
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:41,821
Anything else? Chinese checkers,
a birdhouse, perhaps?

160
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:48,201
All right, give me all your money,
or I'll blow your goddamm brains out!

161
00:11:48,271 --> 00:11:51,205
- Hey! Don't talk to her like that!
- What?

162
00:11:51,273 --> 00:11:53,798
Who the hell do you
think you are, buddy?

163
00:11:53,876 --> 00:11:56,640
- Excuse me, do you have a gun?
- No.

164
00:11:56,712 --> 00:11:58,680
- Then shut up!
- Not so over the top.

165
00:11:58,747 --> 00:12:00,907
What?

166
00:12:02,016 --> 00:12:03,574
- Shit.
- Let's go.

167
00:12:03,651 --> 00:12:06,142
Damn right, "let's go."

168
00:12:07,355 --> 00:12:09,084
Let's go!

169
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,255
Look out!

170
00:12:25,538 --> 00:12:29,099
<i>Johnny?
Johnny?</i>

171
00:12:29,175 --> 00:12:32,268
Johnny?
Oh!

172
00:12:32,344 --> 00:12:37,280
Oh, my god.
I'm not dreaming.

173
00:12:38,515 --> 00:12:42,451
Would you like to go
to the prom with me?

174
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,953
Sure.

175
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:48,184
Great.

176
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:04,235
Oh, Johnny, are you lost?
Are you alone?

177
00:13:04,305 --> 00:13:09,242
<i>If you fall in your empty forest and
you cry out, will no one hear you?</i>

178
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:14,577
<i>We here today will join you
in such a short time.</i>

179
00:13:14,648 --> 00:13:17,173
<i>We will miss you dearly.</i>

180
00:13:17,251 --> 00:13:19,412
Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

181
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,546
What once was,
is no longer. Amen.

182
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:25,613
- Amen.
- Amen.

183
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,809
Good-bye, son.
Be nice to God.

184
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:05,393
I made you bologna and mustard
with the edges cut off...

185
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:07,429
just the way you like it.

186
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:11,766
You eat all of it,
do you hear me?

187
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,392
You hear your mother?

188
00:14:14,468 --> 00:14:16,402
Come on, Marge.

189
00:14:24,811 --> 00:14:27,575
Good-bye, Johnny.

190
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:30,741
I wish we could have
gotten to know each other.

191
00:15:58,328 --> 00:16:02,024
Oh, hi there.
I'm Murray.

192
00:16:02,098 --> 00:16:05,966
- Murray Brickman.
- Johnny Dingle.

193
00:16:06,035 --> 00:16:10,529
Nice to meet you,
Johnny Dingle.

194
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:13,632
Oh, look at you.
You're a mess.

195
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:17,871
Just crawled out
of the grave, did you?

196
00:16:17,945 --> 00:16:21,381
- I guess so.
- Isn't that something.

197
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:24,884
Been a long time since anybody
came back from the dead.

198
00:16:24,952 --> 00:16:28,217
I think the last time
was Thanksgiving, 15 years ago.

199
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:31,383
Hey, wait a minute. Did you say
come back from the dead?

200
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:36,622
Yes. You're now one
of the undead, Johnny Dingle.

201
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:40,563
Doomed to spend the rest of your days
shunned by the human race.

202
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,566
- Whoa, where you going?
- Home.

203
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:46,570
No, you're not. That's what I'm trying
to tell you, Johnny Dingle.

204
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:50,232
You can't ever leave
the cemetery again.

205
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:53,072
I'm not gonna live in the cemetery
the rest of my life.

206
00:16:53,144 --> 00:16:55,078
I got a date Friday night.

207
00:16:55,146 --> 00:16:58,741
I'm very sorry. You'll
have to break the date.

208
00:16:58,816 --> 00:17:02,683
You're crazy. I'm going to the prom
with Missy McCloud.

209
00:17:02,752 --> 00:17:06,016
I'm sure she's very nice,
but you still can't leave.

210
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:08,682
Only death awaits you
among the living.

211
00:17:08,757 --> 00:17:11,521
- I am among the living.
- You're undead.

212
00:17:11,594 --> 00:17:13,528
Hey, look, just because
I crawled out of a grave...

213
00:17:13,596 --> 00:17:15,530
doesn't mean
I'm a friggin' zombie.

214
00:17:15,598 --> 00:17:18,032
It does if you were dead
before you went into the grave.

215
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,534
Okay, look, I admit
maybe I got shot...

216
00:17:20,603 --> 00:17:24,060
- but I didn't die.
- You're very unreasonable.

217
00:17:24,138 --> 00:17:26,072
<i>Excuse me. Where do you
think you're going?</i>

218
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,199
How could I be dead?
I've never felt better in my life.

219
00:17:29,276 --> 00:17:31,369
I'm in love.

220
00:17:31,445 --> 00:17:35,040
- I feel great.
- No, J-Johnny!

221
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:37,912
- If you leave, you'll--
- I'll what?

222
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:43,044
You'll find out.

223
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,733
- Hi, Mom.
- Mmm.

224
00:17:57,801 --> 00:18:01,168
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Johnny.

225
00:18:07,478 --> 00:18:12,847
You know, son, your mother and I
and the ambulance driver...

226
00:18:12,915 --> 00:18:15,849
and the coroner
and the embalmer...

227
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:18,715
were all pretty much convinced
that you were dead.

228
00:18:18,787 --> 00:18:22,587
I got better.

229
00:18:22,658 --> 00:18:25,649
Huh.
Well, welcome home, son.

230
00:18:25,726 --> 00:18:26,604
Thanks.

231
00:18:26,617 --> 00:18:29,287
Are you hungry? Do you
want something to eat?

232
00:18:29,363 --> 00:18:32,093
Gee, there's a lot of food
left over from the funeral.

233
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,174
Oh, my god.

234
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,109
I am dead.

235
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:32,177
Johnny, breakfast is ready.

236
00:19:32,252 --> 00:19:34,686
<i>Coming, Mom.</i>

237
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:37,019
No thanks, Mom.

238
00:19:37,091 --> 00:19:39,630
Hmm, you look a little
pale this morning, son.

239
00:19:39,643 --> 00:19:40,527
I'm dead, Dad.

240
00:19:40,594 --> 00:19:42,653
How about some eggs?

241
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,750
<i>Not hungry.</i>

242
00:19:43,763 --> 00:19:46,859
<i>Not hungry, he says.
Did you hear him?</i>

243
00:19:46,933 --> 00:19:49,197
- Have you got a temperature?
- Of course not.

244
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:51,202
I just told you,
I'm dead.

245
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,567
Well, I'm calling Emille Bronson.

246
00:19:53,638 --> 00:19:56,698
I am not going to Dr. Bronson.
I'm not that desperate.

247
00:19:56,775 --> 00:20:02,042
Ho, ho, ho, ho! I guess I know one young
man who's not going to school today.

248
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:05,139
<i>Hello, Dr. Bronson.
This is Marge Dingle.</i>

249
00:20:05,216 --> 00:20:10,176
Dr. Bronson, the reason I called
is our son, Johnny...

250
00:20:10,254 --> 00:20:13,485
<i>died the other day and I was wondering
if you could take a look at him.</i>

251
00:20:13,557 --> 00:20:15,683
<i>Wouldyou like
to talk to him?</i>

252
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:18,193
Sure.
Johnny?

253
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:20,854
- Eddie Conners?
- Yeah, I'm here.

254
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:26,265
Johnny Dingle? Oh.

255
00:20:33,142 --> 00:20:35,234
Hi, buddy. Hey!

256
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:43,174
Sorry I'm late, Mrs. Cooper. You wouldn't
believe the trouble I had getting here.

257
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,481
I would believe it,
and I'm not impressed.

258
00:20:46,553 --> 00:20:48,885
<i>- You get one demerit.
- But--</i>

259
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:51,136
Just because you're
dead does not mean that

260
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,391
you can come waltzing
in here when you like.

261
00:20:53,459 --> 00:20:57,691
<i>- John Craig?
- Present.</i>

262
00:20:57,763 --> 00:20:59,731
<i>- Linda Given.
- Here.</i>

263
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:03,700
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

264
00:21:03,768 --> 00:21:06,202
- Hey, Missy, wait a minute.
- Johnny, hi.

265
00:21:06,271 --> 00:21:08,204
Uh, listen, you know,
I think it's really great...

266
00:21:08,272 --> 00:21:10,706
that you're back from the dead
and all, but I've got gym.

267
00:21:10,774 --> 00:21:14,335
<i>- But wait a minute.
- Is that him? - Yeah!</i>

268
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:18,714
<i>Look,
maybe she's uncomfortable...</i>

269
00:21:18,782 --> 00:21:21,717
because, you know,
you are recently deceased.

270
00:21:21,785 --> 00:21:24,218
- Eddie, come on, be serious.
- I am serious, Johnny.

271
00:21:24,287 --> 00:21:26,380
I'm just dead. It's not like
I'm an asshole or anything.

272
00:21:26,456 --> 00:21:28,889
I didn't say
you were an asshole.

273
00:21:28,957 --> 00:21:34,725
It's just that some people might consider
being dead somewhat... unfashionable.

274
00:21:34,796 --> 00:21:38,163
- That's really shallow of you, Eddie.
- Shut up and eat your food.

275
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:45,132
God! I can't eat this.
It's disgusting.

276
00:21:45,206 --> 00:21:46,901
You never thought it was
disgusting before.

277
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:49,442
This is totally different. They must
have done something weird to it.

278
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,239
If you don't want it, I'll eat it.

279
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:05,623
What?

280
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:08,660
What do you mean, "What?" You just
tried to take a bite out of my arm!

281
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:12,924
Oh, I'm sorry, Eddie.
It was just gonna be a little bite.

282
00:22:12,997 --> 00:22:15,192
Johnny, you shouldn't
be taking any bites.

283
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:17,859
- Here, let me--
- No, no, no!

284
00:22:19,436 --> 00:22:23,031
You just get the hell
away from my arm.

285
00:22:29,111 --> 00:22:31,375
See you.

286
00:22:31,447 --> 00:22:34,883
Missy, hey.

287
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:38,215
I just want to know what time
I should pick you up for the prom.

288
00:22:38,287 --> 00:22:40,720
Um, you shouldn't.

289
00:22:40,788 --> 00:22:45,053
- What do you mean?
- I have to go.

290
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:48,060
Wait a minute. Are you mad 'cause
I tried to take a bite out of Eddie?

291
00:22:48,128 --> 00:22:50,892
- Oh, no, of course not.
- Then what's wrong?

292
00:22:50,964 --> 00:22:52,898
You're not breaking
our date, are you?

293
00:22:52,966 --> 00:22:55,230
- I came back from the dead for this date.
- Well, gee, Johnny...

294
00:22:55,302 --> 00:22:57,896
it's just, I really didn't
expect you to make it.

295
00:22:57,971 --> 00:23:01,667
Well, I wouldn't have asked
if I couldn't make it.

296
00:23:01,741 --> 00:23:03,834
I'm sorry.

297
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,174
<i>Hey, look,
it's that dead kid.</i>

298
00:23:07,245 --> 00:23:09,179
It's because I'm dead, isn't it?

299
00:23:09,247 --> 00:23:12,182
- That's why you won't go out with me.
- Don't insult me.

300
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,184
You're afraid of what
people might say, aren't you?

301
00:23:14,252 --> 00:23:17,516
Behind your back, everybody whispering,
"There goes Missy with the dead kid."

302
00:23:17,588 --> 00:23:19,852
Look, that has nothing
to do with it, okay?

303
00:23:19,924 --> 00:23:22,518
I only said I would go to the prom
with you because you were dying.

304
00:23:22,593 --> 00:23:26,029
- I'm Buck's girlfriend.
- All right then, forget the prom for now.

305
00:23:26,096 --> 00:23:28,529
- How about a movie? Johnny.
- Hi there.

306
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:30,691
- Buck, hi.
- Hi.

307
00:23:30,767 --> 00:23:32,859
Dead little snot.

308
00:23:32,935 --> 00:23:36,234
You think you can hang out with us decent
living folks like you're still alive?

309
00:23:36,305 --> 00:23:40,674
Why is everyone making such a big deal
about this? I've only been dead one day.

310
00:23:40,742 --> 00:23:43,370
We're watching you, dead boy.
We don't like your kind.

311
00:23:43,445 --> 00:23:45,879
- You're stinkin' up the whole school.
- Chuck!

312
00:23:45,948 --> 00:23:50,714
What are people gonna say? My girlfriend
hanging outwith a decaying kid.

313
00:23:50,785 --> 00:23:53,685
I don't really care what people think
and he's actually a nice guy...

314
00:23:53,753 --> 00:23:56,551
<i>- so cut it out.
- Let's go.</i>

315
00:23:56,623 --> 00:23:59,387
<i>I better not ever catch you
with that dead kid again.</i>

316
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:02,257
I got a reputation.

317
00:24:02,329 --> 00:24:04,319
Eight o'clock.

318
00:24:07,232 --> 00:24:09,166
<i>This was it.</i>

319
00:24:09,234 --> 00:24:11,828
<i>This was the beginning
of a dream come true.</i>

320
00:24:11,904 --> 00:24:15,499
<i>I picked her up early.
I had all the right moves.</i>

321
00:24:15,574 --> 00:24:19,168
<i>I was like Tom Cruise,
only dead.</i>

322
00:24:19,243 --> 00:24:24,339
<i>The stage was set for the most
romantic evening in history.</i>

323
00:24:24,414 --> 00:24:29,909
<i>...womb of hell itself.</i>

324
00:24:29,987 --> 00:24:34,185
<i>Eternally seeking the flesh
of the living.</i>

325
00:24:34,257 --> 00:24:38,693
<i>Bloodthirstyzombies
howling for your flesh.</i>

326
00:24:38,761 --> 00:24:41,285
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

327
00:24:41,363 --> 00:24:44,196
Excuse me.

328
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:48,702
Thanks.

329
00:24:54,608 --> 00:24:57,873
- What are these?
- Ju Jubes.

330
00:24:57,945 --> 00:25:01,642
Really? Are they good?
I've never had one.

331
00:25:01,715 --> 00:25:04,513
Never?
You've never had a Ju Jube?

332
00:25:04,585 --> 00:25:09,646
- Say, isn't that Buck's girl?
- It sure is.

333
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:12,781
- What's she doing here with the dead kid?
- I don't know, man.

334
00:25:12,858 --> 00:25:15,554
They're good, right?
But what's the problem?

335
00:25:15,627 --> 00:25:18,562
- They're stuck in my teeth.
- Right, right.

336
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:23,020
So what you do is take
a drink of your soda.

337
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:24,499
Why?

338
00:25:24,568 --> 00:25:28,163
Just take a drink. Trust me.

339
00:25:30,774 --> 00:25:33,834
There's something wonderful happening
in your mouth now, right?

340
00:25:39,082 --> 00:25:42,676
I can't believe that you came up
with a whole system for this.

341
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:50,183
- Oh, god, I'm sorry. Let me, um--
- No, it's okay.

342
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:54,024
Bloodthirsty zombies
at the foot of your bed...

343
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:56,688
howling for your flesh.

344
00:25:56,763 --> 00:26:02,099
Zombies, like the one right there!

345
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:13,802
You know, it's terrible the way those
zombie movies twist the truth like that.

346
00:26:13,879 --> 00:26:17,110
There's a lot of prejudice
against the undead.

347
00:26:29,226 --> 00:26:31,990
Can I touch you?

348
00:26:32,062 --> 00:26:35,862
Uh-huh.

349
00:26:38,402 --> 00:26:40,962
Your skin feels different
than most guys.

350
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:45,336
- Does that hurt?
- Not much.

351
00:26:45,407 --> 00:26:48,069
Can you even feel it?

352
00:26:48,143 --> 00:26:51,010
Uh-huh.

353
00:26:53,615 --> 00:26:56,175
Can you feel that?

354
00:26:56,251 --> 00:26:59,186
Yeah, I can feel that.

355
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:04,115
I like you, Johnny.

356
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:09,059
Really? Can I kiss you?

357
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:13,461
Uh-huh.

358
00:27:35,085 --> 00:27:37,645
Oh, god.

359
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:43,484
I don't know what it is about you now,
Johnny, but you drive me crazy.

360
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,994
Oh?

361
00:27:46,062 --> 00:27:49,258
- Missy?
- Hmm?

362
00:27:49,331 --> 00:27:55,166
Oh, I know you're already
going with Buck to the prom...

363
00:27:55,236 --> 00:27:59,172
but I was thinking that maybe--

364
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,936
What was that?

365
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,274
Your ear.

366
00:28:04,345 --> 00:28:06,778
What?

367
00:28:06,847 --> 00:28:11,113
- Your ear fell off.
- Oh, shit.

368
00:28:11,185 --> 00:28:13,585
Is that you, sweetheart?

369
00:28:13,654 --> 00:28:16,282
Uh, yes, Dad!
Here, take your ear.

370
00:28:16,356 --> 00:28:18,448
Oh, shit.

371
00:28:18,524 --> 00:28:20,958
But--

372
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:25,293
<i>I heard someone
my age is supposed to be comfortable...</i>

373
00:28:25,363 --> 00:28:28,628
<i>with the way their body changes,
but given the circumstances...</i>

374
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,965
<i>this was too much.</i>

375
00:28:32,037 --> 00:28:35,495
Dr. Bronson?

376
00:28:35,574 --> 00:28:39,134
Dr. Bronson?

377
00:28:42,545 --> 00:28:45,981
- Yes?
- I'm dead.

378
00:29:11,872 --> 00:29:14,272
Okay, well, you're dead...

379
00:29:14,341 --> 00:29:18,937
which is unusual because we don't normally
see this much activity in a dead person.

380
00:29:19,012 --> 00:29:22,277
- Let's look at your symptoms.
- I'm decaying.

381
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:24,613
Oh, good.
- Decay.

382
00:29:24,684 --> 00:29:27,117
All right.
Is that your ear, then?

383
00:29:27,186 --> 00:29:29,211
It fell off about 20 minutes ago.

384
00:29:29,288 --> 00:29:32,415
May I see it?

385
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,015
It's still in good shape.
It's just not on my head.

386
00:29:35,093 --> 00:29:38,790
Hello? Hello?
I'm just teasing.

387
00:29:38,863 --> 00:29:41,525
<i>- May I keep it?
- No way!</i>

388
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:46,626
Well, I need skin samples
so I can run some tests.

389
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:50,139
Well... here.

390
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:55,473
Well, that's very disgusting,
but I guess that'll do fine.

391
00:29:55,544 --> 00:30:00,310
Isn't there, um, some kind of medicine
I could take while you look at that?

392
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,316
- A shot or something?
- To avoid decaying?

393
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,318
- Yes!
- No.

394
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,446
Everything that is dead
eventually decays.

395
00:30:07,522 --> 00:30:10,491
Oh, my god.

396
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:15,324
Wait, wait.
I do think maybe I--

397
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,830
<i>- Aha!
- "Aha" what?</i>

398
00:30:17,898 --> 00:30:20,024
I think I can help you
with that ear.

399
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:24,433
- You want me to glue it on?
- Well, it's either that or the staple gun.

400
00:30:28,574 --> 00:30:32,509
Okay, fine.
This takes care of my ear.

401
00:30:34,246 --> 00:30:37,374
What should I do
about the rest of me?

402
00:30:37,449 --> 00:30:40,350
You really want to know what
I'd do in your situation?

403
00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:44,047
<i>That's when
he sent me to Maggie Benson.</i>

404
00:30:44,121 --> 00:30:46,918
<i>The doctor said that
at the rate I was decaying...</i>

405
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:50,517
<i>I'dbe dead, really dead,
by tomorrow.</i>

406
00:30:50,593 --> 00:30:52,788
<i>So Maggie was my only choice.</i>

407
00:30:52,862 --> 00:30:55,896
<i>Local legend had it that
her husband came back</i>

408
00:30:55,909 --> 00:30:58,630
<i>from the dead 15 years
ago, just like me.</i>

409
00:30:58,702 --> 00:31:03,229
<i>So if anyone could help me with my
decaying thing, she'd be the one.</i>

410
00:31:03,305 --> 00:31:06,069
Hello?

411
00:31:14,816 --> 00:31:17,910
Anybody here?

412
00:31:26,293 --> 00:31:28,921
<i>Oh, my dear boy.</i>

413
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:32,362
You're a zombie.

414
00:31:32,431 --> 00:31:36,025
So it ripped right off
in her mouth, did it?

415
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:39,867
Yes, ma'am.
Right off.

416
00:31:39,938 --> 00:31:45,535
That must have been
so embarrassing.

417
00:31:47,445 --> 00:31:50,505
You have no idea.

418
00:31:50,582 --> 00:31:53,550
She must be quite a gal.

419
00:31:53,617 --> 00:31:55,550
She is.

420
00:31:55,618 --> 00:31:58,212
But I don't know if she'll even
see me after what happened.

421
00:31:58,287 --> 00:32:00,312
Have a little faith.

422
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:03,484
Things aren't so bad.

423
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:07,153
No, they're pretty bad.

424
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:11,325
I just found out I'm gonna be
really dead by tomorrow.

425
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,335
I was told you knew how to
stop that from happening.

426
00:32:14,403 --> 00:32:17,167
Oh, Johnny, I--

427
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:22,403
I haven't talked about zombies
for a long, long time.

428
00:32:22,476 --> 00:32:26,707
I need to live long enough to go to the
prom tomorrow night. I'll do anything.

429
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,749
- Oh, no, don't be so quick to--
- Anything.

430
00:32:29,816 --> 00:32:32,876
Oh, my dear boy,
you don't understand.

431
00:32:36,256 --> 00:32:38,451
There is something you can do...

432
00:32:38,525 --> 00:32:40,856
but it is a terrible thing.

433
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:43,359
Tell me.

434
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:50,363
Flesh of the living.

435
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:53,268
The more you eat,
the more time you have.

436
00:32:53,337 --> 00:32:55,702
Are you crazy?

437
00:32:55,772 --> 00:32:57,865
There's nothing else
you can do.

438
00:32:57,941 --> 00:32:59,806
There's got to be.

439
00:32:59,876 --> 00:33:01,726
Look, I almost took a
bite out of my friend

440
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:03,642
Eddie and it was such
the wrong thing to do.

441
00:33:03,713 --> 00:33:05,613
He's very mad.

442
00:33:07,817 --> 00:33:11,946
- A bite will give you about 20 minutes.
- Twenty minutes?

443
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,998
<i>I need a whole day.</i>

444
00:33:13,011 --> 00:33:14,989
<i>Then you'll have to
eat a little more.</i>

445
00:33:15,056 --> 00:33:17,889
<i>- How much more?
- Oh, my goodness, it's hard to say.</i>

446
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:22,919
An arm, a leg,
a stomach, a foot.

447
00:33:22,997 --> 00:33:25,261
<i>It's not an exact science,
you know.</i>

448
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:28,062
What kind of friggin' nut are you,
tellin' me to go out and eat people?

449
00:33:28,135 --> 00:33:30,501
I'm not telling you
to eat people.

450
00:33:30,571 --> 00:33:36,440
I'm saying eating the flesh of the living
is... buying you a little more time...

451
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:37,942
<i>but it's an awful price to pay.</i>

452
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,376
Well, it doesn't matter because
I'm not eating anybody!

453
00:33:40,446 --> 00:33:42,277
Well, then you'll be
dead by tomorrow.

454
00:33:42,348 --> 00:33:45,646
- How the hell do you know?
- John Dingle, I know.

455
00:33:45,717 --> 00:33:48,515
Well, I'm gonna find a way.

456
00:33:52,924 --> 00:33:54,858
<i>I have acquired a skin sample...</i>

457

17 and a zombie.</i>

458
00:33:58,095 --> 00:34:00,961
<i>In order to prevent him
from completely decaying...</i>

459
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,464
<i>I must use his flesh
to create a serum...</i>

460
00:34:03,533 --> 00:34:08,334
<i>that will actually reverse the natural
process of decay we all suffer...</i>

461
00:34:08,404 --> 00:34:10,964
<i>as we grow older.</i>

462
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,975
<i>It stands to reason that his zombie
flesh should contain within it...</i>

463
00:34:14,043 --> 00:34:17,443
<i>the genetic code for the reanimation
of dead tissue.</i>

464
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:22,814
<i>Ergo, life after death.</i>

465
00:34:49,474 --> 00:34:51,840
Hi, Johnny.

466
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:57,507
Hi. What are you doing here?

467
00:34:57,582 --> 00:35:01,450
Oh, I just came by
to see how you were.

468
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:03,453
How's your ear?

469
00:35:03,521 --> 00:35:06,785
Fine. Good as new.

470
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:10,121
Let me see.

471
00:35:10,193 --> 00:35:15,187
Wow! You know, you can hardly
even tell it ripped off your head.

472
00:35:15,264 --> 00:35:20,792
You think so? I was feeling
a little insecure about it.

473
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,633
You know, Johnny...

474
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:26,970
you're a really
good-looking guy.

475
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:30,136
- You think so?
- Absolutely.

476
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:32,475
A little style in your--

477
00:35:32,546 --> 00:35:35,140
- Oh, shit.
- What?

478
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:38,150
Sorry.

479
00:35:38,218 --> 00:35:40,812
Oh, that's all right.
It's not your fault.

480
00:35:40,887 --> 00:35:43,481
Here, let me see if I can just--

481
00:35:45,225 --> 00:35:47,819
You smell really nice.

482
00:35:47,894 --> 00:35:49,885
Thanks.

483
00:35:54,066 --> 00:35:57,831
Um, my--

484
00:35:57,902 --> 00:35:59,927
I'll get it.

485
00:36:09,346 --> 00:36:11,780
Got it.

486
00:36:27,028 --> 00:36:29,121
Be sure you get it on straight.

487
00:36:29,197 --> 00:36:33,133
Oh, it's on straight.

488
00:36:34,535 --> 00:36:37,470
There. Much better.

489
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,133
Listen, Johnny,
it's getting kind of late.

490
00:36:42,209 --> 00:36:47,305
I should probably be going so you can
lay down and let that nose harden.

491
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,814
No, no, wait, wait, wait.
Don't leave, don't leave.

492
00:36:49,882 --> 00:36:52,976
- I want to talk toyou--
- Let go!

493
00:36:53,052 --> 00:36:56,647
Johnny, I am not even gonna look.
Just get this thing off of me.

494
00:36:56,722 --> 00:37:00,919
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

495
00:37:00,992 --> 00:37:06,191
No, wait! Everything's fine.
Don't leave. Minor setback.

496
00:37:06,264 --> 00:37:08,697
Johnny, look at you!

497
00:37:08,766 --> 00:37:12,725
I'm fine. Nothing else
is gonna fall off.

498
00:37:24,013 --> 00:37:27,449
Thank you, God.
Thank you, God.

499
00:37:27,517 --> 00:37:29,950
<i>Shake a leg,
Johnny! Breakfast!</i>

500
00:37:30,018 --> 00:37:35,785
Mom, I told you I can't
eat that stuff anymore.

501
00:37:35,856 --> 00:37:39,189
There's got to be
someone I can eat.

502
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:28,566
- Back off, dead boy.
- Sorry.

503
00:38:28,637 --> 00:38:32,937
- Hi, Johnny.
- Oh, hi.

504
00:38:33,008 --> 00:38:35,771
<i>Doyourememberlastnight
when we were in the car...</i>

505
00:38:35,844 --> 00:38:38,278
- and your ear-- you know, it--
- Fell off?

506
00:38:38,346 --> 00:38:42,112
Right. Well, that got me to wondering.

507
00:38:42,183 --> 00:38:44,947
What if your other
ear were to fall off?

508
00:38:45,019 --> 00:38:46,952
Uh-huh.

509
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,455
Well, then, what if other stuff
started falling off.

510
00:38:50,523 --> 00:38:53,207
I don't know, like
your arms or something.

511
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,118
Yeah.

512
00:38:54,193 --> 00:38:57,287
Well, then if stuff
just kept falling off...

513
00:38:57,363 --> 00:39:00,890
- pretty soon--
- I'd just be a little pile of stuff.

514
00:39:00,967 --> 00:39:02,901
Right.

515
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:06,563
So what I was wondering is if something
like that might actually happen?

516
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:08,799
If it did would you
feel different towards me?

517
00:39:08,874 --> 00:39:12,502
Is that what's gonna
happen to you, Johnny?

518
00:39:12,576 --> 00:39:16,876
It's--
It's a definite possibility.

519
00:39:16,947 --> 00:39:20,405
Oh, god.

520
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:25,420
You are so different from any
other guy I have ever known.

521
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,389
Buck would kill me if he found out
I was going outwith you.

522
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:32,258
You're decaying and--

523
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:37,424
Still, god, I wish
you weren't dead.

524
00:39:37,499 --> 00:39:41,093
Me too.

525
00:39:41,169 --> 00:39:44,297
You know, I've never kissed
a dead guy before you, Johnny.

526
00:39:44,372 --> 00:39:46,897
- Got you!
- Geez!

527
00:39:46,974 --> 00:39:48,908
Damn it! Holy--

528
00:39:48,976 --> 00:39:51,945
Come here, you stinkin'
dead ya-hoo toucher!

529
00:39:52,013 --> 00:39:55,448
<i>- Buck, stop him.
- Come here!</i>

530
00:39:55,515 --> 00:39:57,449
Hey, come on.

531
00:39:57,516 --> 00:39:59,950
Chuck, you don't understand.

532
00:40:00,019 --> 00:40:02,954
Come on, Chuck, let's sit down
and just hash this thing out.

533
00:40:03,022 --> 00:40:05,456
I'm gonna kill you, dead boy!

534
00:40:07,693 --> 00:40:09,786
<i>- Come here!
- Maybe we should, uh--</i>

535
00:40:09,862 --> 00:40:12,921
Come here, you stinkin'
dead ya-hoo toucher!

536
00:40:12,997 --> 00:40:14,965
Chuck, look.

537
00:40:15,033 --> 00:40:16,967
Chuck.

538
00:40:17,035 --> 00:40:19,799
Chuck!
Chuck, let's um--

539
00:40:19,871 --> 00:40:22,464
Chuck.
Chuck.

540
00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:25,906
- Chuck, let's discuss this.
- Okay.

541
00:40:49,063 --> 00:40:52,464
- Uh-oh.
- Huh?

542
00:40:55,736 --> 00:40:58,795
Chuck?

543
00:40:58,872 --> 00:41:01,773
<i>You okay?</i>

544
00:41:10,182 --> 00:41:14,448
I am really, truly sorry
about this, Chuck.

545
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:17,977
There's just no other way.

546
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,351
Oh! Oh, no!

547
00:41:24,428 --> 00:41:27,454
Oh, hi, Eddie.

548
00:41:27,532 --> 00:41:30,467
<i>Youknow, colleges look
at this sort of thing!</i>

549
00:41:30,535 --> 00:41:32,798
- Oh.
- Johnny?

550
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:35,803
Oh, great.

551
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:40,570
Oh, my god!
How could you?

552
00:41:40,643 --> 00:41:42,577
You ate Chuck!

553
00:41:42,645 --> 00:41:45,307
Not all of him.

554
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:47,644
- Hello, this is Brenda
Bodine and we're coming to you live...

555
00:41:47,715 --> 00:41:50,980
from Fairview High School where we just
received word that some sort oftragic--

556
00:41:51,052 --> 00:41:53,816
- Excuse me. Sheriff McCloud.
- I'm gonna have to ask you all--

557
00:41:53,888 --> 00:41:55,495
We just received word
that some sort of tragedy

558
00:41:55,508 --> 00:41:56,823
has happened in the
high school today.

559
00:41:56,891 --> 00:42:00,417
- Uh, no, nothing unusual.
- I was referring to the slaughter.

560
00:42:00,494 --> 00:42:02,428
- Right. Well, there was that.
- Sheriff--

561
00:42:02,496 --> 00:42:04,429
Earlier today one of the students
got badly killed.

562
00:42:04,497 --> 00:42:08,934
We've heard reports that the murderer
might have been 17-year-old Johnny Dingle.

563
00:42:09,001 --> 00:42:11,435
I'm going to make
an official statement here.

564
00:42:11,504 --> 00:42:13,938
Johnny Dingle is dead. Okay?

565
00:42:14,006 --> 00:42:15,940
Yes, but then this wouldn't
be the first time...

566
00:42:16,008 --> 00:42:18,272
that someone has come back
from the dead in Fairview...

567
00:42:18,344 --> 00:42:20,777
to wreak havoc
on an innocent victim.

568
00:42:20,845 --> 00:42:25,679
What is a zombie and how can you tell if
there's one living in your neighborhood?

569
00:42:36,859 --> 00:42:39,623
Ooh!

570
00:42:39,696 --> 00:42:41,789
<i>- Emille?
- What is it?</i>

571
00:42:41,864 --> 00:42:44,298
<i>- You have a patient.
- I'm busy.</i>

572
00:42:44,367 --> 00:42:47,460
<i>It's Chuck Bronski.
He was eaten in school today.</i>

573
00:42:47,536 --> 00:42:49,470
All right, all right,
I'll have a look at him.

574
00:42:49,538 --> 00:42:54,133
But while I'm doing that, I want you
to go out and find me a live chicken.

575
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:58,474
<i>- A chicken?
- Just do it!</i>

576
00:42:58,546 --> 00:43:02,243
All right.

577
00:43:04,919 --> 00:43:08,911
Hello, Chuck. My name is Doctor Bronson.
How are we doing today?

578
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:11,354
<i>Isee.</i>

579
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:14,756
Chuck, you've suffered
a lot of bleeding...

580
00:43:14,827 --> 00:43:17,591
and there's an ax in your head...

581
00:43:17,663 --> 00:43:21,599
and it appears that someone
has eaten your stomach.

582
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:23,759
Pulse is a little lower than I'd like.

583
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:28,772
Let's just take a look
at your retinal response.

584
00:43:29,874 --> 00:43:33,435
Oh, hi. You must be
Big Chuck Bronski.

585
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:36,673
Hello.

586
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:38,647
<i>Oh, my god!</i>

587
00:43:38,715 --> 00:43:41,080
<i>I have some
bad news. Your boy is very sick.</i>

588
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,948
He's lost a massive
amount of blood...

589
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:45,954
and his pulse and retinal
response are poor...

590
00:43:46,022 --> 00:43:48,616
and, as you can see, there's
an ax sticking out of his head.

591
00:43:48,691 --> 00:43:52,388
- He's not sick, you idiot, he's dead!
- Oh, everybody's a doctor!

592
00:43:52,461 --> 00:43:55,521
You think maybe I could
make the diagnosis?

593
00:43:55,597 --> 00:43:58,929
It's like somebody ate him!

594
00:43:58,999 --> 00:44:03,834
What kind of a monster would do that
to another human being?

595
00:44:04,738 --> 00:44:06,296
Mom!

596
00:44:06,373 --> 00:44:09,934
- Here.
- I have a big problem.

597
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:14,469
- John, you have a visitor.
- Oh, hey, Eddie.

598
00:44:14,547 --> 00:44:18,244
Look, about today, that wasn't
entirely my fault.

599
00:44:18,317 --> 00:44:20,285
Oh, it's not just today.
It's yesterday too.

600
00:44:20,353 --> 00:44:23,981
- What happened yesterday?
- You tried to eat my arm, pal!

601
00:44:24,056 --> 00:44:27,786
Oh, I think you owe
someone an apology.

602
00:44:27,858 --> 00:44:30,486
I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.

603
00:44:30,561 --> 00:44:34,998
Just--Just don't try
to eat me anymore, all right?

604
00:44:35,066 --> 00:44:37,796
- I promise.
- Still buds?

605
00:44:37,868 --> 00:44:42,271
- Huh?
- Yeah, still buds.

606
00:44:42,339 --> 00:44:44,898
Ah, that's what I like to hear.

607
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:47,271
Hi, honey.

608
00:44:47,342 --> 00:44:49,435
Hi, sweetie.

609
00:44:49,511 --> 00:44:54,107
Oh, son, did you by any chance
murder a boy in school today?

610
00:44:54,183 --> 00:44:59,314
- It wasn't murder. It was an accident.
- Well, I hope you didn't eat him.

611
00:44:59,388 --> 00:45:01,878
'Cause lunch is in five minutes...

612
00:45:01,956 --> 00:45:04,891
and I picked up something special
for you at the supermarket.

613
00:45:04,959 --> 00:45:07,018
Oh, boy!

614
00:45:07,095 --> 00:45:10,724
- Hi.
- Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

615
00:45:10,798 --> 00:45:14,028
- Mmm!
- You picked up a little kid!

616
00:45:14,101 --> 00:45:17,069
<i>Am I wrong, or do you
have to eat the flesh of the living?</i>

617
00:45:17,136 --> 00:45:19,730
Mom, I absolutely
can't do that anymore!

618
00:45:19,805 --> 00:45:23,400
Well, there are hungry people all over
the world who'd be thrilled to eat him.

619
00:45:23,476 --> 00:45:26,411
Yeah, my mom says that
to me all the time.

620
00:45:26,479 --> 00:45:28,538
<i>Come on,
just send him home!</i>

621
00:45:28,614 --> 00:45:31,082
Uh, I'll get it.

622
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:33,083
Oh, shit!

623
00:45:44,495 --> 00:45:47,259
<i>- Mr. Dingle?
- Yes?</i>

624
00:45:47,331 --> 00:45:50,197
I understand that your boy
is a zombie.

625
00:45:50,266 --> 00:45:54,430
- Mm-hmm, yes, that's right.
- Well, he killed and ate my boy today...

626
00:45:54,504 --> 00:45:59,100
so me and some of the other guys
decided to come over and talk to him.

627
00:45:59,175 --> 00:46:01,506
Uh, hold on. Honey!

628
00:46:01,576 --> 00:46:03,807
<i>There's some people here
who want to talk to Johnny.</i>

629
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:04,567
<i>Invite them in!</i>

630
00:46:04,645 --> 00:46:08,342
Uh, I don't want them
to think ill of us.

631
00:46:08,415 --> 00:46:12,374
Well, uh, oh!
Honey, this is the father...

632
00:46:12,453 --> 00:46:14,921
of the boy that Johnny
murdered in school today.

633
00:46:14,989 --> 00:46:17,719
I know how difficult
it is to lose a son.

634
00:46:17,792 --> 00:46:20,487
We lost Johnny just
a couple of days ago.

635
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,393
Yes, ma'am.
I'm still reeling.

636
00:46:23,462 --> 00:46:26,260
So is there someway
we could see the boy?

637
00:46:26,331 --> 00:46:28,822
Sure. I think he's hiding
in the closet.Johnny!

638
00:46:28,901 --> 00:46:31,267
<i>Come on out, sweetie!</i>

639
00:46:31,336 --> 00:46:33,861
<i>Are they gone?</i>

640
00:46:33,939 --> 00:46:38,170
Whoa! Hey, quit it!

641
00:46:41,345 --> 00:46:45,042
- Oh, wow.
- Will you cut it out?

642
00:46:45,116 --> 00:46:47,550
<i>- Ooh, wicked, awesome.
- Uh, fellas...</i>

643
00:46:47,617 --> 00:46:49,744
Johnny's already dead, you see...

644
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,981
so, um, you're gonna have
a hard time killing him.

645
00:46:52,055 --> 00:46:56,252
- Hi, Daddy.
- Oh, hi, little Chuck.

646
00:46:56,325 --> 00:46:58,953
- Little Chuck?
- This is little Chuck?

647
00:46:59,028 --> 00:47:01,680
What are you doing with
my one remaining son?

648
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:02,691
Nice going, Ma.

649
00:47:02,765 --> 00:47:07,168
<i>Daddy, that dead man
tried to eat me.</i>

650
00:47:07,236 --> 00:47:10,693
- Stop it!
- That won't work, you idiots!

651
00:47:10,772 --> 00:47:14,639
<i>- But this will.
- Excuse me.</i>

652
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:21,376
- You wouldn't shoot me.
- I might.

653
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:25,717
<i>- Jesus!
- Now get out of my house...</i>

654
00:47:25,785 --> 00:47:28,117
or I'll clip your manhood.

655
00:47:28,187 --> 00:47:31,679
<i>All right, Ma!</i>

656
00:47:31,757 --> 00:47:35,488
<i>Come on, let's get out
of here. Let's go, little Chuck.</i>

657
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:39,087
- All right, Daddy.
- We'll be back.

658
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:54,806
<i>It was time to stop running.</i>

659
00:47:54,879 --> 00:48:00,213
<i>Time to summon up the courage that
had eluded me for 12 straight years.</i>

660
00:48:00,283 --> 00:48:03,252
<i>Time to complete
my life's mission.</i>

661
00:48:11,661 --> 00:48:13,992
<i>It was still there.</i>

662
00:48:14,062 --> 00:48:17,657
<i>Waiting patiently for this moment.
Gathering a little dust, sure...</i>

663
00:48:17,732 --> 00:48:21,361
<i>but otherwise... untouched.</i>

664
00:48:23,305 --> 00:48:27,502
<i>I had the confidence.
I had the gift.</i>

665
00:48:27,575 --> 00:48:30,270
<i>This time
I was definitely ready.</i>

666
00:48:32,412 --> 00:48:36,178
<i>I was actually not looking
forward to going to the prom.</i>

667
00:48:36,249 --> 00:48:40,652
<i>And then my mom found this place where they
dye your shoes in the exact same shade...</i>

668
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,054
<i>as your fabric... and they're
also dyeing my purse.</i>

669
00:48:45,124 --> 00:48:49,752
<i>Can I tell you... I am so relieved that
you are going to the prom with Buck.</i>

670
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:54,127
<i>I mean... I heard this really nasty rumor
that you might be going with that dead kid.</i>

671
00:48:54,198 --> 00:48:58,635
Oh... no. We just went
to the movies together.

672
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:02,536
He died for me. I figured it was the
least that I could do. N-No big deal.

673
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,804
Hi.

674
00:49:11,881 --> 00:49:14,644
- Johnny, please, just leave.
- No, you have to listen to me.

675
00:49:14,717 --> 00:49:18,743
<i>How can you expect me to listen to you
after what you did to Chuck?</i>

676
00:49:21,623 --> 00:49:23,098
<i>I wanna talk to
you about that.</i>

677
00:49:23,111 --> 00:49:25,559
<i>There is nothing you can
say to make things better...</i>

678
00:49:25,627 --> 00:49:28,528
because you ate someone,
do you understand that?

679
00:49:28,596 --> 00:49:31,724
Wait a minute! Are you afraid I might
eat you? Is that the problem?

680
00:49:31,799 --> 00:49:35,165
Are you kidding me?
Will you just leave me alone!

681
00:49:35,235 --> 00:49:38,635
You may not know this, Missy,
but I ate Chuck for you.

682
00:49:40,406 --> 00:49:42,840
God, my boyfriend
won't even pump gas for me.

683
00:49:44,877 --> 00:49:46,811
What?

684
00:49:46,879 --> 00:49:50,780
Oh, geez, Miss,
I didn't wanna eat him...

685
00:49:50,849 --> 00:49:54,285
but it was the only way I could live
long enough to go to the prom with you.

686
00:49:56,254 --> 00:49:59,587
You ate someone just to go
to the prom with me?

687
00:49:59,658 --> 00:50:03,457
I died for you! I came back
from the dead for you.

688
00:50:05,329 --> 00:50:08,559
I love you.

689
00:50:12,568 --> 00:50:15,799
Come on, let's go.

690
00:50:15,872 --> 00:50:19,535
- I don't understand, Johnny.
- What?

691
00:50:19,609 --> 00:50:24,977
How... you can love me so much?
How you can do all these things for me?

692
00:50:25,046 --> 00:50:28,447
By god, if it ain't the zombie out
with a livin' woman.

693
00:50:28,516 --> 00:50:31,952
- He's mighty proud.
- Go get Chuck.

694
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,052
<i>Look, Miss...</i>

695
00:50:35,122 --> 00:50:38,488
other people might want you
because you're pretty and popular...

696
00:50:38,558 --> 00:50:41,220
and they wanna
be seen with you.

697
00:50:41,294 --> 00:50:44,957
I want you
because I love you.

698
00:50:45,031 --> 00:50:49,023
- And I always have.
- It's not natural.

699
00:50:52,137 --> 00:50:54,969
- What's this?
- Open it.

700
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:58,805
I've been tryin' to give you
this since the first grade.

701
00:51:01,646 --> 00:51:03,614
Oh.

702
00:51:05,216 --> 00:51:09,084
<i>Youare the kindest, smartest,
most beautiful girl I've ever known.</i>

703
00:51:09,153 --> 00:51:12,212
<i>And, uh--
And I would die happy...</i>

704
00:51:12,289 --> 00:51:15,018
<i>ifyou would dance just one dance
with me at the prom.</i>

705
00:51:16,192 --> 00:51:18,752
I would love to go
to the prom with you.

706
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:41,379
This mornin' he eats your boy and now
he's out there kissin' on the McCloud girl.

707
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:47,208
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Shut up, you little zombie slut!

708
00:51:47,286 --> 00:51:50,050
- I am not a slut.
- Leave her alone.

709
00:51:50,123 --> 00:51:51,122
She's a good girl.

710
00:51:51,135 --> 00:51:53,559
Good girls don't hang
around with dead boys.

711
00:51:53,626 --> 00:51:55,253
- Tramp!
- Zombie lover.

712
00:51:55,328 --> 00:51:58,422
<i>- Whore of the undead.
- Enough!</i>

713
00:51:58,498 --> 00:52:01,397
It's not her fault.

714
00:52:01,465 --> 00:52:04,559
She was taken in
by his wily decaying ways.

715
00:52:04,635 --> 00:52:07,069
- That's not true, Buck.
- You don't even know what you're saying.

716
00:52:07,138 --> 00:52:10,733
I'll kill him.
I swear I'll kill him.

717
00:52:10,808 --> 00:52:13,572
- Daddy.
- What the hell is goin' on here?

718
00:52:13,644 --> 00:52:15,668
Johnny Dingle's
what's goin' on.

719
00:52:15,745 --> 00:52:18,805
Johnny Dingle is dead. Right?

720
00:52:18,882 --> 00:52:20,907
Yes, sir.

721
00:52:22,385 --> 00:52:25,376
He ate my son and he's takin'
your daughter to the prom.

722
00:52:25,454 --> 00:52:28,946
<i>So I'd say that's pretty
damned active fora dead guy.</i>

723
00:52:29,024 --> 00:52:32,459
I demand a zombie burning!
I want vengeance for my son.

724
00:52:32,527 --> 00:52:34,222
Yeah, you're damn right!

725
00:52:34,295 --> 00:52:37,264
Missy, Johnny,
let's get in the car.

726
00:52:37,331 --> 00:52:41,131
<i>Something's gotta be done.</i>

727
00:52:41,202 --> 00:52:45,161
<i>Yougot until sundown,
Sheriff, to banish that abomination.</i>

728
00:52:45,239 --> 00:52:47,672
<i>After that...
he's ours.</i>

729
00:52:48,842 --> 00:52:51,309
- Why, hello, Sheriff.
- Well...

730
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:53,902
<i>to what do we owe
the pleasure of your visit?</i>

731
00:52:53,979 --> 00:52:57,176
I was hoping to have a word
with you about Johnny.

732
00:52:59,652 --> 00:53:04,486
I think maybe it's time for the Dingles
and the McClouds to have a little chat.

733
00:53:06,658 --> 00:53:10,685
Well, this just looks wonderful, ma'am.

734
00:53:10,762 --> 00:53:12,696
Let's all dig in.

735
00:53:14,798 --> 00:53:19,598
John, honey, I wonder, could you get us
some butter for the croissants?

736
00:53:19,669 --> 00:53:22,160
<i>- Sure, Mom.
- Thank you, dear.</i>

737
00:53:31,581 --> 00:53:34,675
Mom?

738
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,947
Excuse me.

739
00:53:41,922 --> 00:53:44,447
- What the hell is this?
- A body.

740
00:53:44,525 --> 00:53:46,516
I know it's a body.

741
00:53:46,594 --> 00:53:49,119
- Who put it here?
- I did.

742
00:53:49,196 --> 00:53:51,755
- You did?
- I thought you might like a snack.

743
00:53:51,831 --> 00:53:54,800
A snack? What are we,
the Manson family now?

744
00:53:54,868 --> 00:53:57,336
Where did you get this body?

745
00:53:57,403 --> 00:53:59,769
- Found it.
- You found it?

746
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:03,205
I was at the mortuary. They're
practically giving them away.

747
00:54:03,275 --> 00:54:07,768
<i>Mom, they don't give bodies
away... at the mortuary.</i>

748
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:12,274
I sure like beans.

749
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:18,381
- Everything okay, then?
- Right as rain.

750
00:54:18,456 --> 00:54:23,519
Mm-hmm. Then let's get right to it,
Johnny. I know you killed Chuck Bronski.

751
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:27,050
He didn't kill him, Daddy,
he just ate him.

752
00:54:27,129 --> 00:54:31,122
<i>That's enough, young lady.
I'll have no more smart talk out of you!</i>

753
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,465
<i>Daddy, what about those guys at the
Donner Pass who ate their friends?</i>

754
00:54:34,536 --> 00:54:36,333
<i>Nobody got mad at them.</i>

755
00:54:36,405 --> 00:54:39,344
<i>Would you excuse me
for a moment, Sheriff?</i>

756
00:54:39,357 --> 00:54:40,340
<i>Of course.</i>

757
00:54:40,408 --> 00:54:45,141
<i>You know what Big Chuck Bronski and the
townspeople would like to do to your son?</i>

758
00:54:45,213 --> 00:54:49,081
They'd like to break out some torches
and have themselves a zombie barbecue.

759
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:52,516
- What do you want me to do?
- I'll make you a deal.

760
00:54:52,586 --> 00:54:54,747
You leave town right now,

761
00:54:54,821 --> 00:54:57,414
quietly, never show
your face around here again...

762
00:54:57,490 --> 00:55:00,186
<i>andI will keep the townspeople
off you until you get away.</i>

763
00:55:02,261 --> 00:55:05,492
<i>- This sounds like a good deal.
- Okay, but only...</i>

764
00:55:05,564 --> 00:55:07,759
if I can escort
Missy to the prom first.

765
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:11,769
You are not taking my daughter to the
prom, you stupid dead son-of-a-bitch!

766
00:55:11,837 --> 00:55:15,862
- I am going with him, Daddy.
- You are not going, and that is final!

767
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:17,637
You are being so unfair.
What do you have

768
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:19,603
against Johnny besides
the fact that he's dead?

769
00:55:19,677 --> 00:55:22,407
- You need another reason?
- What are you so afraid of?

770
00:55:22,479 --> 00:55:23,673
That you'll eat her,
for one thing.

771
00:55:23,747 --> 00:55:25,578
Oh, that's crazy!
I would never eat Missy!

772
00:55:25,649 --> 00:55:28,208
- He didn't eat us.
- He didn't eat the dog.

773
00:55:28,284 --> 00:55:30,445
See?

774
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,614
Look, you little tough guy...

775
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:37,182
you get outta town now
or I will personally kill you again.

776
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,693
- You don't frighten me?
- Oh, no?

777
00:55:39,761 --> 00:55:42,229
- And you can't stop me?
- Really?

778
00:55:44,198 --> 00:55:47,258
<i>And what can I get for madame?</i>

779
00:55:49,337 --> 00:55:53,205
<i>- Duck, please.
- Oh, tres bien. And for the monsieur?</i>

780
00:55:54,342 --> 00:55:57,311
I will have the T-bone steak.

781
00:55:57,378 --> 00:56:00,813
<i>Excellent choice.
And for the lepetit monsieur...</i>

782
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,371
may I suggest
the delicious buffet?

783
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:07,044
Get your food, honey.

784
00:56:08,988 --> 00:56:12,389
You just don't know when to stop,
do you, you miserable little shit?

785
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:14,619
- This is the buffet?
- You tell me?

786
00:56:14,693 --> 00:56:17,855
<i>Is there anyone in my family
you don't plan to eat today?</i>

787
00:56:17,929 --> 00:56:21,126
- I didn't do this. I'm not gonna eat you.
- 'Cause you're a coward.

788
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:23,793
- You shut up. Shut up!
- Coward. Coward.

789
00:56:23,868 --> 00:56:27,769
Oh-ho, you're pretty tough when
it comes to eatin' high schoolers.

790
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:29,951
When it comes to chowin'
down on a real man,

791
00:56:29,964 --> 00:56:31,899
you're quite the little
wussy, ain't ya?

792
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:34,670
Listen, pal,
you say one more thing--

793
00:56:34,744 --> 00:56:37,611
- Wussy. Wussy.
- That's it.

794
00:56:39,648 --> 00:56:42,139
Johnny, don't do that. Oooh.

795
00:56:42,218 --> 00:56:46,951
Not so easy, is it? There's a
lot of livin' in that foot.

796
00:56:47,023 --> 00:56:50,185
- There, smart-ass.
- Foot's easy.

797
00:56:50,258 --> 00:56:54,819
There's nothing on a foot. Now,
calf's a different story; all muscle!

798
00:56:54,895 --> 00:56:57,386
We'll just see about that.

799
00:56:57,464 --> 00:57:01,127
Oh, you can kiss that calf
muscle good-bye, fat man.

800
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,910
I'm stuffed.

801
00:57:12,979 --> 00:57:18,041
You call that eating? A herd of guppies
could've picked me clean in half the time.

802
00:57:19,351 --> 00:57:22,615
Come on, it looks yummy. Yummy.

803
00:57:23,854 --> 00:57:26,152
All right.

804
00:57:36,033 --> 00:57:38,830
- Johnny!
- Missy!

805
00:57:38,901 --> 00:57:42,928
Daddy was right; you were
gonna eat me, weren't you?

806
00:57:43,005 --> 00:57:45,701
Don't be ridiculous,
I would never eat you.

807
00:57:45,774 --> 00:57:49,540
And why not? What, I'm not
good enough for you?

808
00:57:50,512 --> 00:57:54,038
Johnny...

809
00:57:54,115 --> 00:57:56,675
I think you should try.

810
00:57:56,751 --> 00:58:00,209
Come on...
take a little bite.

811
00:58:03,657 --> 00:58:07,525
Don't you understand?
I love you.

812
00:58:07,594 --> 00:58:10,426
And I love you, Johnny.

813
00:58:10,496 --> 00:58:13,954
That's why I want you...
to eat me.

814
00:58:16,635 --> 00:58:19,365
Don't you wanna eat me?

815
00:58:19,438 --> 00:58:21,372
Well--

816
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,307
<i>- Johnny? Johnny honey?
- Mom?</i>

817
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:26,605
Are you all right, son?

818
00:58:30,581 --> 00:58:33,379
- Yeah.
- You don't look very good.

819
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:36,248
Where's Missy?

820
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,590
Come in.

821
00:58:47,763 --> 00:58:50,391
Why aren't you dressed?

822
00:58:50,466 --> 00:58:53,161
I'm not going.

823
00:58:53,235 --> 00:58:56,762
Oh, sure you are,
honey, come on.

824
00:58:56,838 --> 00:59:00,603
<i>Hey, Buck's gonna
be here any minute.</i>

825
00:59:01,775 --> 00:59:05,006
I am not going to the prom
with Buck, Daddy.

826
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:08,378
The only person I want to go
to the prom with is Johnny.

827
00:59:08,449 --> 00:59:10,383
Damn it, Missy!

828
00:59:10,451 --> 00:59:14,216
Now, honey, I know that you care
about this boy, but...

829
00:59:14,287 --> 00:59:16,846
in a couple of months you are
going to go off to college...

830
00:59:16,922 --> 00:59:20,050
and you'll meet a nice young man
who's still alive.

831
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:23,891
- Won't that be better?
- I don't want a living boy, I want Johnny.

832
00:59:23,962 --> 00:59:27,227
Get dressed! You are going
to the prom with Buck!

833
00:59:27,299 --> 00:59:30,495
- I am not going to the prom--
- And that's final!

834
00:59:45,482 --> 00:59:49,042
Johnny, are you okay?
I'm really sorry about my dad.

835
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:52,383
It's okay. Look, if you still wanna
go with me, put on your gown...

836
00:59:52,454 --> 00:59:56,914
- and I'll carry you down the trellis.
- Okay.

837
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:02,426
Aaa-oooh!

838
01:00:02,497 --> 01:00:04,726
Johnny?
Johnny?

839
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:06,732
Oh, Johnny.

840
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,937
My, uh-- My muscles
are starting to decay.

841
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:10,998
Oh.

842
01:00:11,071 --> 01:00:13,972
Johnny.

843
01:00:14,041 --> 01:00:18,170
Here, grab my hand.

844
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:32,547
- Are you kind of dying now?
- Kind of.

845
01:00:36,327 --> 01:00:38,818
Maybe this'll help.

846
01:00:48,472 --> 01:00:51,838
<i>I want you... to eat me.</i>

847
01:00:51,907 --> 01:00:54,933
She is very tender
this evening.

848
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:58,245
Eat me.

849
01:00:58,313 --> 01:01:00,645
Don't you wanna eat me?

850
01:01:00,716 --> 01:01:04,277
- Aaah!
- Oh, my god.

851
01:01:04,353 --> 01:01:06,547
It's okay, Johnny.

852
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:09,613
- Oh, my god, I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay. I don't care.

853
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:12,284
- I can't take you to the prom.
- No, Johnny.

854
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,955
- Don't be silly. It's fine.
- I have to go. I have to go, Missy.

855
01:01:16,029 --> 01:01:18,122
Johnny, no.

856
01:01:19,866 --> 01:01:23,892
Buck called.
He'll be here in a moment.

857
01:01:23,969 --> 01:01:27,405
Get dressed...
and come downstairs.

858
01:01:34,179 --> 01:01:36,977
Oh... I can't watch.

859
01:01:37,049 --> 01:01:40,210
The chicken... feels no pain.

860
01:01:48,058 --> 01:01:50,618
Now, this won't hurt a bit.

861
01:01:50,694 --> 01:01:53,094
Emille.

862
01:01:53,163 --> 01:01:55,562
Get in there. Okay.

863
01:02:10,211 --> 01:02:13,509
Yes. It works.

864
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:17,175
- Emille. Oh, I'm so proud of you.
- It works.

865
01:02:17,251 --> 01:02:19,670
Oh, Shelley, I'm about
to save a young man's

866
01:02:19,683 --> 01:02:21,950
life. A moment every
physician dreams of.

867
01:02:22,022 --> 01:02:25,480
Hope you won't think harshly of me,
darling, but I'm having a thought.

868
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:26,988
Quick, the solution.

869
01:02:27,001 --> 01:02:30,995
Suppose we obtain a sizable
quantity of the zombie flesh.

870
01:02:31,063 --> 01:02:34,726
A few arms, a few legs.
He's almost dead already.

871
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:38,566
- I don't follow you.
- Then if we took the flesh...

872
01:02:38,637 --> 01:02:43,539
- and mixed up a really
big batch of your wonderful serum--

873
01:02:43,607 --> 01:02:48,135
The fountain of youth; cosmetic
surgery without the surgery.

874
01:02:48,212 --> 01:02:52,807
Shelley, nothing must prevent me from
honoring a promise I made to a young man...

875
01:02:52,882 --> 01:02:55,248
in terrible, terrible trouble.

876
01:02:55,318 --> 01:02:57,946
I think we could make
a shit load of money.

877
01:03:00,589 --> 01:03:03,820
- What the hell are you doin'?
- No, no, what the hell are you doin'?

878
01:03:03,892 --> 01:03:07,419
I'm leaving. I can't take Missy to
the prom, I just tried to eat her.

879
01:03:07,496 --> 01:03:09,685
- Well, then get ready to say,
"Eddie, you're a genius."

880
01:03:09,698 --> 01:03:10,431
- Why?

881
01:03:10,499 --> 01:03:14,833
Because I solved your problem. I know how
you can go with Missy without eating her.

882
01:03:14,903 --> 01:03:17,369
- You do?
- Mm-hmm. My plan is so perfect, so simple.

883
01:03:17,437 --> 01:03:19,234
- What is it? Yes!
- You ready?

884
01:03:19,306 --> 01:03:21,001
Eat Buck.

885
01:03:21,074 --> 01:03:24,271
<i>- Are you crazy?
- Let's look at this logically.</i>

886
01:03:24,344 --> 01:03:26,701
Your biggest fear is
that if you go the prom

887
01:03:26,714 --> 01:03:28,872
with Missy, you might
end up eating her.

888
01:03:28,949 --> 01:03:31,008
Not if you're already full.

889
01:03:31,084 --> 01:03:32,113
<i>Eddie, come on.</i>

890
01:03:32,126 --> 01:03:35,247
<i>If you eat Buck, Missy's
gonna need a date to the prom.</i>

891
01:03:35,321 --> 01:03:37,983
<i>You'll be full,
and you'll live longer.</i>

892
01:03:38,057 --> 01:03:40,150
<i>- Would you be serious?
- I am serious.</i>

893
01:03:40,226 --> 01:03:42,535
I'm very, very serious.
Johnny, you're already

894
01:03:42,548 --> 01:03:44,423
going to Hell for
all eternity, so...

895
01:03:44,496 --> 01:03:47,726
what do you care?

896
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:56,401
- God, I hate that guy.
- Eat him.

897
01:03:56,473 --> 01:04:01,069
Eat him quick. Put on his tux and then
honk the horn. Missy will come out...

898
01:04:01,145 --> 01:04:04,773
<i>you two will go the prom together, Missy's
parents will think she's goin' with Buck.</i>

899
01:04:04,846 --> 01:04:08,976
It couldn't be more perfect. Let's jump
him on three. It's brilliant. One...

900
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:11,211
<i>two...</i>

901
01:04:11,286 --> 01:04:14,153
- three!
- No, I can't.

902
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:19,093
Hi.

903
01:04:19,693 --> 01:04:21,752
For you.

904
01:04:39,077 --> 01:04:42,877
I have to go now.

905
01:04:42,948 --> 01:04:46,577
I can't trust myself
to be around people anymore.

906
01:04:48,187 --> 01:04:51,122
- Look, I don't care if you're a--
- No, this is it.

907
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:54,103
I won't ever see you again.
You know that, right?

908
01:04:54,116 --> 01:04:55,090
Yes.

909
01:04:55,158 --> 01:04:59,356
- You're the worst friend I've ever had.
- You too.

910
01:04:59,429 --> 01:05:03,866
Just don't forget me, Eddie...
after I'm gone, please?

911
01:05:03,934 --> 01:05:07,734
- Just don't forget me.
- I won't.

912
01:05:19,681 --> 01:05:21,979
<i>I have wonderful news.
Ask me what?</i>

913
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:24,381
- Would you come on already?
- I'm saving your life.

914
01:05:24,451 --> 01:05:27,147
Hop in. We're going to my lab.

915
01:05:27,221 --> 01:05:30,850
- Go get Missy.
- Okay.

916
01:05:38,232 --> 01:05:40,859
Oh, it looks so cool.

917
01:05:42,434 --> 01:05:44,925
I guess you'd rather
be herewith the dead kid.

918
01:05:45,003 --> 01:05:47,062
His name is Johnny.

919
01:05:47,138 --> 01:05:49,606
If you like him so much, then
why didn't you go with him?

920
01:05:49,674 --> 01:05:54,407
I did wanna go with him.
He just didn't wanna go with me.

921
01:05:54,479 --> 01:05:57,811
<i>Are you telling me that you
got dumped by the dead kid?</i>

922
01:05:57,824 --> 01:05:58,938
<i>Missy, wait!</i>

923
01:05:59,016 --> 01:06:02,008
- What do you want, dick-weed?
- I need to talk to you about Johnny.

924
01:06:02,086 --> 01:06:04,646
- Johnny doesn't wanna be with me.
- Of course he does.

925
01:06:04,722 --> 01:06:07,986
He was just afraid that if he was
with you, he might end up eating you.

926
01:06:08,057 --> 01:06:11,584
You have two seconds to get out
of my face, ass-wipe.

927
01:06:11,661 --> 01:06:15,824
Then, I'll rip your spine
up through your mouth.

928
01:06:15,898 --> 01:06:18,833
Oh.

929
01:06:19,768 --> 01:06:22,532
Oh.

930
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:25,129
- Wow!
- Wow.

931
01:06:25,207 --> 01:06:27,300
Where's Johnny?

932
01:06:27,376 --> 01:06:29,366
Getting saved.

933
01:06:31,344 --> 01:06:34,404
<i>What Missy
and Eddie didn't know was that...</i>

934
01:06:34,481 --> 01:06:37,416
<i>across town
at that very moment...</i>

935
01:06:37,484 --> 01:06:42,615
<i>Dr. Bronson was hitting a level of
weirdness I had never dreamed possible.</i>

936
01:06:42,689 --> 01:06:46,749
- Why are you strapping me down?
- Standard operating procedure.

937
01:06:46,825 --> 01:06:49,487
Will it be painful?

938
01:06:49,562 --> 01:06:51,689
Well, define "pain."

939
01:06:51,764 --> 01:06:53,822
<i>- Oh, god.
- To save you...</i>

940
01:06:53,898 --> 01:06:58,494
I'm gonna have to borrow like
a few cells from your body.

941
01:06:58,570 --> 01:07:01,868
- How many?
- Oh, just a few. Maybe 40 pounds.

942
01:07:01,939 --> 01:07:06,000
40 pounds! Are you crazy?
I can't spare 40 pounds of flesh!

943
01:07:06,076 --> 01:07:09,512
- All right, 30.
- No, not 30, not 20--

944
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:13,676
- Don't be such a baby!
- Well, you kick in 40 pounds of flesh.

945
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:17,776
Johnny, I'm not the dead guy. Don't you
think you're being a little irrational?

946
01:07:17,852 --> 01:07:20,946
Would you explain how
cutting 40 pounds off me...

947
01:07:21,022 --> 01:07:23,217
<i>- is gonna save my life?
- It's not.</i>

948
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:25,020
- It's not?
- No.

949
01:07:25,093 --> 01:07:27,220
<i>- Then how does it help me?
- It doesn't.</i>

950
01:07:27,295 --> 01:07:30,958
- It doesn't?
- I may not have found a way to save you...

951
01:07:31,032 --> 01:07:34,865
but I have discovered a way
to use your remarkable flesh...

952
01:07:34,935 --> 01:07:36,869
to create a serum...

953
01:07:36,937 --> 01:07:41,237
to rejuvenate old skin to make people
feel younger and look younger.

954
01:07:41,308 --> 01:07:44,902
Cosmetic surgery
without the surgery.

955
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:47,970
Th-That's-- That's how
I'm gonna market it.

956
01:07:48,047 --> 01:07:51,002
You're gonna cut me up
and make me into soup

957
01:07:51,015 --> 01:07:53,916
so you can give
peopleyounger-looking skin?

958
01:07:53,986 --> 01:07:55,613
It sucks for you, huh?

959
01:07:55,687 --> 01:07:59,316
- Let me go, you son-of-a-bitch!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

960
01:07:59,391 --> 01:08:03,384
<i>This will be a lot easier
if you just... relax.</i>

961
01:08:03,462 --> 01:08:05,895
No! Oh, no.
Oh, oh!

962
01:08:05,963 --> 01:08:08,374
Here we go now. Now, just-just, okay.
Here we go.

963
01:08:08,387 --> 01:08:09,193
No!

964
01:08:09,265 --> 01:08:11,665
Okay. Oh!

965
01:08:11,735 --> 01:08:15,136
Just a minute, a minute.Just a minute.

966
01:08:19,809 --> 01:08:22,504
What do you want?

967
01:08:22,578 --> 01:08:25,012
- We want the zombie!
- Yeah!

968
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:27,241
Well, there's no zombie here.

969
01:08:27,316 --> 01:08:31,308
- We think he went in there!
- Well, you're a very confused man.

970
01:08:31,386 --> 01:08:34,321
<i>- We saw him.
- Now, go home. Good night.</i>

971
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:41,093
- What's going on out there?
- There's a mob that wants to kill you.

972
01:08:41,161 --> 01:08:44,528
- But don't worry, I need to kill you more.
- Oh, great.

973
01:08:44,598 --> 01:08:47,089
Oh, unfortunately we don't
have time for an anesthetic.

974
01:08:47,167 --> 01:08:49,931
- What?
- All right, all right, okay.

975
01:08:50,003 --> 01:08:51,834
<i>- No! No!
- Uh, uh.</i>

976
01:08:51,905 --> 01:08:54,270
Uh, oh!

977
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:56,864
Just, just don't move.

978
01:08:56,941 --> 01:08:59,205
<i>One... two...</i>

979
01:08:59,277 --> 01:09:02,678
three... ram!

980
01:09:02,747 --> 01:09:04,772
Uh-oh.

981
01:09:09,553 --> 01:09:12,147
You stay right there.

982
01:09:17,461 --> 01:09:20,395
God, Johnny, what's going on?
You okay?

983
01:09:20,463 --> 01:09:23,125
Three... ram!

984
01:09:24,634 --> 01:09:26,567
Aaa-aaah!

985
01:09:26,635 --> 01:09:28,865
<i>- Where is he?
- Where is who?</i>

986
01:09:28,937 --> 01:09:30,871
- The zombie!
- What zombie?

987
01:09:30,939 --> 01:09:33,917
The only damn zombie running
through town, you idiot!

988
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:35,638
Can you describe this zombie?

989
01:09:38,647 --> 01:09:41,638
<i>Stop that zombie! Is he here?</i>

990
01:09:41,716 --> 01:09:44,240
<i>- Let's find him!
- We saw him come in here.</i>

991
01:09:44,317 --> 01:09:46,182
Aha! Where is he?

992
01:09:46,252 --> 01:09:48,584
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

993
01:09:48,655 --> 01:09:51,988
- Your friend, the zombie.
- We're just here to get our flu shots.

994
01:09:52,058 --> 01:09:54,822
<i>- Down here.
- Get him!</i>

995
01:09:54,894 --> 01:09:57,624
<i>Come on, let's find him!</i>

996
01:09:57,696 --> 01:10:00,324
<i>- He's around here somewhere.
- Save a few chunks for me!</i>

997
01:10:00,399 --> 01:10:02,424
<i>- Where is he?
- What?</i>

998
01:10:02,501 --> 01:10:04,935
<i>- Where'd the zombie go?
- Over here!</i>

999
01:10:05,003 --> 01:10:07,937
Down there!

1000
01:10:10,108 --> 01:10:13,339
Johnny, run!

1001
01:10:13,411 --> 01:10:16,140
Oh.

1002
01:10:16,213 --> 01:10:18,443
There he is!

1003
01:10:23,153 --> 01:10:25,144
Oh.

1004
01:10:28,992 --> 01:10:32,221
- Which way?
- He went that way.

1005
01:10:33,628 --> 01:10:36,358
Murray!

1006
01:10:36,431 --> 01:10:38,956
Murray!

1007
01:10:39,033 --> 01:10:43,561
<i>- Hurry, open the gates!
- Johnny. Hi, Johnny.</i>

1008
01:10:43,638 --> 01:10:45,697
Murray, open the gate.

1009
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:49,004
<i>- Hurry up!
- What is it?</i>

1010
01:10:49,076 --> 01:10:51,271
What? What?

1011
01:10:51,345 --> 01:10:53,939
Oh, dear. Oh.

1012
01:10:57,216 --> 01:11:01,482
Well, I warned you.
You wouldn't listen.

1013
01:11:01,554 --> 01:11:04,647
Hurry.

1014
01:11:07,826 --> 01:11:10,351
We're closed.

1015
01:11:10,428 --> 01:11:14,330
<i>Run, Johnny, run!</i>

1016
01:11:15,433 --> 01:11:17,424
Whoa!

1017
01:11:22,672 --> 01:11:25,869
Oh! Huh?

1018
01:11:28,311 --> 01:11:31,246
Now, I've got you, Johnny Dingle.
It's barbecue time.

1019
01:11:31,314 --> 01:11:34,306
- Light up the zombie.
- Stop!

1020
01:11:34,383 --> 01:11:36,817
- You leave him alone!
- Get up, little girl.

1021
01:11:36,885 --> 01:11:40,116
- Get off of me!
- Get your hands off her.

1022
01:11:40,189 --> 01:11:42,419
Honey...

1023
01:11:42,491 --> 01:11:45,004
<i>let the zombie go and I'll
buy you a pretty new dress.</i>

1024
01:11:45,017 --> 01:11:45,857
<i>No, Daddy.</i>

1025
01:11:45,927 --> 01:11:48,760
<i>This way, Marge.
This way. Son?</i>

1026
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:52,128
Son, frankly I don't care
who thinks ill of us.

1027
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:54,759
Just...
get the hell away...

1028
01:11:54,835 --> 01:11:58,271
<i>from our son.</i>

1029
01:11:58,338 --> 01:12:01,466
Well, Sheriff...

1030
01:12:01,541 --> 01:12:04,704
<i>do something.</i>

1031
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:07,745
Okay.
Light up the zombie.

1032
01:12:07,812 --> 01:12:10,246
No! Daddy!

1033
01:12:10,315 --> 01:12:12,647
<i>You can't.</i>

1034
01:12:12,717 --> 01:12:15,743
He died for me.

1035
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:20,553
He came back from the dead for me.
He ate someone for me.

1036
01:12:22,193 --> 01:12:26,219
Everything that happened to him
happened because he loved me.

1037
01:12:27,998 --> 01:12:31,899
<i>Sheriff? Sheriff?</i>

1038
01:12:31,968 --> 01:12:35,460
Uh... would you
have died for her?

1039
01:12:35,538 --> 01:12:36,618
Of course.

1040
01:12:36,631 --> 01:12:39,906
Would have come back
from the dead for her?

1041
01:12:41,643 --> 01:12:43,804
I don't know.

1042
01:12:43,879 --> 01:12:46,643
Could you have eaten
someone to be with her?

1043
01:12:49,351 --> 01:12:51,410
No.

1044
01:12:51,486 --> 01:12:55,012
No.

1045
01:12:55,089 --> 01:12:57,613
Could any of you?

1046
01:12:57,690 --> 01:13:00,352
- Huh? Huh?
- No.

1047
01:13:03,062 --> 01:13:06,088
I rest my case.

1048
01:13:10,069 --> 01:13:13,094
Well, he won't die by my hand.

1049
01:13:15,073 --> 01:13:18,099
Then he'll die by ours.
Who votes we kill 'em?

1050
01:13:25,683 --> 01:13:29,550
Well, I hope somebody eats the whole
damn bunch of you. Fatheads.

1051
01:13:31,621 --> 01:13:36,923
If my daughter desires a dance
with this fine young man...

1052
01:13:36,993 --> 01:13:39,928
then by God they're gonna dance.

1053
01:13:48,069 --> 01:13:52,403
<i>So there I was getting
a police escort to the prom with Missy.</i>

1054
01:13:52,473 --> 01:13:56,773
<i>It was the best moment
of my entire life.</i>

1055
01:13:56,844 --> 01:13:59,277
<i>I was also pretty sure
it was gonna be the last...</i>

1056
01:13:59,346 --> 01:14:01,473
<i>but right then,
that didn't matter.</i>

1057
01:14:01,548 --> 01:14:03,714
<i>What mattered was I was
gonna have the dance</i>

1058
01:14:03,727 --> 01:14:06,643
<i>I'd been waiting for
since the first grade.</i>

1059
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:10,147
<i>That much I was sure of.
But still, nothing</i>

1060
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:12,386
<i>could've prepared me for
what was about to happen.</i>

1061
01:14:47,889 --> 01:14:51,552
We finally got
our dance, sweetie.

1062
01:15:23,454 --> 01:15:27,220
Johnny, no.

1063
01:15:37,234 --> 01:15:39,259
Please don't go.

1064
01:15:42,906 --> 01:15:44,896
I... love you.

1065
01:15:44,974 --> 01:15:48,466
I love you too.

1066
01:16:23,676 --> 01:16:26,439
<i>Ah, there you are.</i>

1067
01:16:26,511 --> 01:16:29,309
<i>- You.
- What? What?</i>

1068
01:16:29,381 --> 01:16:31,542
<i>We've been waiting!</i>

1069
01:16:31,616 --> 01:16:33,913
<i>- For me?
- Of course for you...</i>

1070
01:16:33,984 --> 01:16:35,918
you dumb sloat.

1071
01:16:35,986 --> 01:16:39,513
<i>You see anyone else who was supposed
to be here four days ago?</i>

1072
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:42,057
Hey, look, I'm, uh--

1073
01:16:42,125 --> 01:16:44,889
I'm really sorry. I-I didn't know
anybody was waiting.

1074
01:16:44,961 --> 01:16:48,419
<i>When you die, you are supposed
to come directly here...</i>

1075
01:16:48,498 --> 01:16:50,693
where we pass judgment...

1076
01:16:50,767 --> 01:16:53,201
<i>andsendyou to Heaven or Hell.</i>

1077
01:16:53,269 --> 01:16:55,122
You are not supposed
to climb out of the

1078
01:16:55,135 --> 01:16:57,226
grave, muck around on
Earth waiting to die...

1079
01:16:57,305 --> 01:16:59,273
a second time!

1080
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:03,003
I-I-I didn't plan that,
it just happened.

1081
01:17:07,582 --> 01:17:11,541
Sorry about all the yelling.
Here's the situation:

1082
01:17:11,619 --> 01:17:14,610
There's been a little mistake.

1083
01:17:14,688 --> 01:17:16,781
What kind of mistake?

1084
01:17:16,857 --> 01:17:18,791
The fact is...

1085
01:17:18,859 --> 01:17:23,318
you weren't actually supposed to die
in the convenience store.

1086
01:17:23,395 --> 01:17:26,193
- What?
- No, no, just calm down. It's all here.

1087
01:17:26,265 --> 01:17:28,732
May 28th, 8:33 p.m.:

1088
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,839
Robber enters convenience
store, threatens

1089
01:17:30,852 --> 01:17:32,998
Missy McCloud. She
attempts to stop robbery.

1090
01:17:33,071 --> 01:17:36,563
Robber turns to shoot her, in doing so
knocks over a pot of coffee with his elbow.

1091
01:17:36,641 --> 01:17:38,438
- Wait a minute!
- Mm-hmm?

1092
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:41,172
He was supposed
to slip on coffee?

1093
01:17:41,246 --> 01:17:44,477
Supposed to, but... didn't.

1094
01:17:44,549 --> 01:17:48,210
It doesn't happen very often but somewhere
someone screwed up and the result is...

1095
01:17:48,284 --> 01:17:51,185
a sad, tragic mistake.

1096
01:17:51,254 --> 01:17:53,415
The result is I'm dead!

1097
01:17:53,489 --> 01:17:55,423
Whenever we...
make a mistake...

1098
01:17:55,491 --> 01:17:58,460
we try to rectify it by giving the person
a second chance on life;

1099
01:17:58,528 --> 01:18:01,257
<i>a chance to prove their worth.</i>

1100
01:18:01,329 --> 01:18:04,821
That accounts for the existence
of the occasional zombie.

1101
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:07,130
What they do when back...

1102
01:18:07,202 --> 01:18:11,433
<i>from the dead determines what
we do with them in the afterlife.</i>

1103
01:18:11,505 --> 01:18:16,670
Hey, look. I wanna talk to you about Chuck.
He was practically dead before I ate him.

1104
01:18:17,844 --> 01:18:21,109
I'm sorry. It's time
you were on your way.

1105
01:18:21,181 --> 01:18:25,481
- On my way to where?
- To where you belong, Johnny Dingle.

1106
01:18:25,552 --> 01:18:27,611
To where you belong.

1107
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:34,057
<i>Next.</i>

1108
01:18:46,737 --> 01:18:49,137
- Hi, Johnny.
- Hey.

1109
01:18:49,206 --> 01:18:52,698
All right, gimme all your money
or I'll blow your damn brains out.

1110
01:18:53,944 --> 01:18:57,401
Don't worry.
Everything will be okay.

1111
01:18:57,479 --> 01:18:59,674
Let's go!

1112
01:19:00,449 --> 01:19:02,679
Let's go!

1113
01:19:07,155 --> 01:19:09,680
<i>Look out!</i>

1114
01:19:11,993 --> 01:19:14,962
<i>Johnny!</i>

1115
01:19:23,669 --> 01:19:26,229
Now he knocks
over the coffee.

1116
01:19:26,305 --> 01:19:30,002
Oh, god, Johnny.

1117
01:19:33,079 --> 01:19:36,537
Ever since the first grade I've been
desperately in love with you.

1118
01:19:36,616 --> 01:19:41,609
You're the kindest, smartest,
most beautiful girl I've ever known.

1119
01:19:41,686 --> 01:19:44,553
And after I'm gone...

1120
01:19:44,623 --> 01:19:49,855
I just want you to know that you
meant more to me... than life itself.

1121
01:19:51,862 --> 01:19:55,262
I love you, Missy.

1122
01:20:00,937 --> 01:20:03,098
You're not shot.

1123
01:20:03,172 --> 01:20:05,299
What?

1124
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:12,377
The bullet hit this thing
you were wearing.

1125
01:20:26,726 --> 01:20:30,127
You tried to sacrifice
your life for me.

1126
01:20:30,196 --> 01:20:34,495
You'd have done
the same for me.

1127
01:20:34,566 --> 01:20:38,332
Trust me... I know.

1128
01:20:43,574 --> 01:20:46,236
Would you like to go
to the prom with me?

1129
01:20:51,316 --> 01:20:54,479
<i>And that's it. That's the whole story.</i>

1130
01:20:54,552 --> 01:20:58,714
<i>I know it seems pretty preposterous
but it happened just that way.</i>

1131
01:20:58,788 --> 01:21:01,484
<i>IfI had to do it all over again
and I could do it differently...</i>

1132
01:21:01,557 --> 01:21:05,960
<i>nothing.</i>

1133
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:09,987
<i>Well, I take that back.
That's not entirely true.</i>

1134
01:21:10,066 --> 01:21:12,257
<i>I think I would
have eaten Buck.</i>
