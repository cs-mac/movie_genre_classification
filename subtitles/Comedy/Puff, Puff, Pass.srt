1
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,311
<i>... and it was just as easy as...</i>

2
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:23,322
<i>one, two, three.</i>

3
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:28,560
<i>Tiny classified ads.</i>

4
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,254
<i>That's right.</i>

5
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:35,427
- This is so inspirational.
- You're damn right it's inspirational.

6
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:39,768
<i>I went from a guy who was</i>
<i>constantly behind on his monthly rent...</i>

7
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,069
<i>to a multimillionaire entrepreneur...</i>

8
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,667
- And it's so simple, too.
- That's what makes it genius.

9
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:47,742
I don't understand
why more people don't do it.

10
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:53,845
<i>Operators... Well, they're standing by.</i>

11
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,115
'Cause they're scared, Larry.
Afraid to take risk, man.

12
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,394
- Yeah.
- Told you the man's a genius.

13
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:04,492
And he's making moves.
See the size of that yacht?

14
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,553
Yeah.

15
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:08,928
- That was a nice yacht.
- That's what I'm talking about, man.

16
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,529
And you heard the man, right?
"Anybody can do it."

17
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:15,164
- Exactly.
- Know what's sad?

18
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,909
A man who's so afraid to take a risk...

19
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,572
that he wastes his whole life playing it safe.

20
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:24,875
Look at my uncle Victor.
You remember him, right?

21
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:28,478
This cat worked three full-time jobs
for 35 years, man.

22
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:32,182
Three full-time jobs for what?
He ain't got shit.

23
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,919
A damn raggedy-ass house
that he's still paying for.

24
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:36,791
And then on top of that, guess what?

25
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,990
They forced his ass into early retirement.

26
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,693
- You know what they gave him?
- 401 (k)?

27
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:45,195
No. A pat on the back
and a fucking watch, man.

28
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,672
Now, was that worth it?

29
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,269
Well, it depends on the watch.

30
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:53,369
I mean, if they gave him a Patek Philippe
or a Roger Dubuis...

31
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,845
That's not the point, man.

32
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:57,382
The point is,
the guy is dying of ass cancer now.

33
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,975
All messed up.
His kids all messed up on drugs.

34
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,884
One of them is a fucking tranny.

35
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,352
- Which one?
- You crazy?

36
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:07,818
Lisa.

37
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:11,660
Lisa's a dude?

38
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,993
Yeah, you knew Lisa was a dude, right?

39
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:23,574
Yeah, of course I knew.

40
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,868
This is some good shit, right?

41
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,283
- Who is it?
- Lance.

42
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,882
<i>... I went from a guy</i>
<i>who was constantly behind on his rent...</i>

43
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,478
Your landlord!

44
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,885
Lance! Hey!

45
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,758
- Hi, Lance. We were just talking about you.
- Really? What, were you...

46
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,602
- What?
- It's your flip-flops, Lance.

47
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,141
- My flip-flops?
- You gotta take them off, man.

48
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,110
It's kind of a Zen thing
we do around the apartment here.

49
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,784
Listen, guys. Really...

50
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:11,415
I really, really, really, really
need the rent money.

51
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:18,093
- But it's not due till the 5th.
- But it's the 15th.

52
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,189
And, you're already three months behind.

53
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,700
So, am I gonna see some money?

54
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,436
Not exactly.

55
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:29,435
You know, technically, just technically...

56
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,000
- you're not on this lease.
- But when Steve moved out...

57
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:35,172
When Steve moved out, I let you guys
come in, and you're good guys.

58
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:38,911
You're good guys, but you're always late
with the rent money.

59
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,215
Wait a minute, Lance.
There've been a few times...

60
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:44,450
- Irregardless.
- Regardless.

61
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,116
What?

62
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,717
Regardless. I mean,
"irregardless" isn't a word.

63
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:52,026
Listen, Lance.
Things are really about to pop over here.

64
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,589
We're in the process
of getting a business off the ground.

65
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:58,660
Yeah, it's a "tiny classified ads" business.

66
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,873
- A "tiny classified ads" business?
- Yeah.

67
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,001
For what?

68
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,273
Well, that's not the point. You see, Lance...

69
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,214
the ads themselves generate income.

70
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,220
It's complex.

71
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,321
I understand ads. Ads for what?

72
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,759
Okay, Lance, look.
It's clear that you are not a risk-taker, okay?

73
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,360
So why don't you just stick
to your little real-estate investments...

74
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,696
bumming a couple of bucks a month
off guys like us.

75
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,763
- Where's the profit, man?
- Where is the profit?

76
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,932
- That's chickenfeed, baby.
- Chickenfeed?

77
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,235
So where's my chickenfeed?

78
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:44,748
I want my money or I'm going to take action.

79
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,243
Take action?

80
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,811
Look, just chill right there, okay...

81
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,017
while my business partner
and I go discuss this new deal...

82
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,252
that you've put on the table, okay?

83
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,455
Wait, "new deal"? There is no new deal.

84
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,291
Just relax, baby. We're gonna be right back
and take care of you, okay?

85
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,371
Rico, this is getting serious.

86
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:12,868
What do you think?

87
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:16,005
I don't know,
maybe we should order the program.

88
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,016
Order the program? Why?

89
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,447
I don't know,
in case there are some details we missed.

90
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,216
Details? What more
do we need to know, man?

91
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:27,692
Dick just spent the last half an hour
laying the whole thing out for us.

92
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,723
Well, yeah, you got a point there.

93
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,787
Look, man, you got to understand, man.

94
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,991
The average person wants something
for nothing.

95
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,864
They're not willing to commit themselves...

96
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:40,405
to sit down and watch an entire infomercial,
like we just did.

97
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,297
Yeah, you're right.

98
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,105
- Which already puts us ahead of the game.
- Exactly.

99
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:49,581
Congratulations, partner.
We are officially small-business owners.

100
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,209
Yeah!

101
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,684
You know what comes on today
at 4:00, right?

102
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,089
You think I don't?

103
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,719
<i>- Shawshank Redemption.</i>
<i>- Shank</i> marathon on TNT.

104
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,695
All weekend long, baby.

105
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,068
- Pong?
- Pong.

106
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,984
Oh, you got nothing on me, bitch.

107
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,950
Money shot, bitch.

108
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,612
The bank is open, bitch.

109
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,782
Well?

110
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,013
Whoa!

111
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,356
Yo, man, you can't just walk in here
without knocking.

112
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:39,057
- What's up with that, Lance?
- What's going on here, Lance?

113
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:42,761
You know what? This is crap. This is crap!

114
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,498
I'm sick and tired of your shenanigans.

115
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,405
This is it, and I mean it.

116
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,514
- Oh, Lance.
- What a dick.

117
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,151
I got the point, bitch.

118
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:06,020
Yeah, well, you needed me to spot you
a point anyway, bitch.

119
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,526
I got to take a shit. You wanna come?

120
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,363
Let's roll.

121
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,268
Morning.

122
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,340
Oh, my God!

123
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:32,249
- Hey, excuse me, I need some more soymilk.
- What you need is rehab.

124
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,149
Yeah, rehab is your only option.

125
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,415
You need to get your shit together.

126
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,014
You can't keep assing around
your whole life.

127
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,820
Yeah, I know. Can you fucking believe it?

128
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:46,160
An intervention. On me. Yeah, I know.

129
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,531
It was like they gave me
some bullshit pamphlet...

130
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:52,435
about some rehab
I'm supposed to check out. Like...

131
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,675
Well, I lost the freaking thing already.

132
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,105
The pamphlet for the rehab thing
I'm supposed... The...

133
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,376
Are you even listening to me?

134
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:08,809
Dude, I gotta roll. What?

135
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:14,716
The deal? Yeah, it's still going down.

136
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:18,628
Yeah. Yeah. I got a customer.

137
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:19,790
Late.

138
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,723
May I help you?

139
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,229
Rehab? Wait, wait, wait.

140
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,601
You're telling me coffee-shop guy...

141
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,573
the biggest get-high crackhead in town...

142
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:33,009
told you that you need rehab? Please, man.

143
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,739
I don't know. It looks kind of nice.

144
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:38,011
They got volleyball, biofeedback...

145
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:43,121
"Heavens House, the easier, softer way."

146
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,679
Give me that.

147
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,591
Ain't nothing easy or soft about rehab, man.

148
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,560
You do realize
you can't get high in there, right?

149
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:50,823
Really?

150
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,323
Why is there always a catch?

151
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,389
'Cause it's rehab, Larry.

152
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,697
Maybe coffee-shop guy
knows something we don't.

153
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,964
Yeah, like where the nearest crackhouse is.

154
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,932
What?

155
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,384
Hey, there's your girl, Elise.

156
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,883
Aren't you supposed to be hooking up
with her?

157
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,083
Yeah, but I'm playing it kind of slow
right now.

158
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,625
- Smart.
- Yeah.

159
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,891
- What's up, Elise?
- Hey...

160
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,195
- Rico.
- Hi, right.

161
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,728
Big Daddy, this is Chico and, sorry...

162
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,335
Hi, I'm Larry.

163
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:12,775
- They're my neighbors.
- What's up, fellas? How you doing?

164
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,472
That is a beautiful car, Big Daddy.

165
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,879
Oh, you like that?
You know, I just picked that up.

166
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,984
$80,000 worth of pure flames.

167
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,454
Whoa. What kind of job do you have to have
to get a car like that?

168
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:24,921
I'm an investor.

169
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,049
- Well, cool.
- Investor!

170
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,717
Me and my partner here
have our own business.

171
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:31,024
Really? What's it called?
"Chico and the Man"?

172
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,333
No. It's a "tiny classified ads" business.

173
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,967
It's complex.

174
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,562
You know what, you're absolutely right.

175
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,108
Starting your own business
is extremely complex.

176
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,109
- You know, there was a time...
<i>- Oh, Big Daddy.</i>

177
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,644
One second, fellas.

178
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,808
<i>Oh, Big Daddy!</i>

179
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,207
Hello. Yeah, cool. Yes, yes. Hold on.

180
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,149
Hey, you know what, guys?
I've really got to take this.

181
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,414
But it was a pleasure meeting you.

182
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,547
And good luck
on your new business venture.

183
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:00,217
You know what, Elise,
give these fellas my card.

184
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,419
Maybe we can do
some business together sometime.

185
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,326
- Maybe.
- All right.

186
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,995
So, Elise, this your man? This Big Daddy?

187
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,706
Hey, Elise, so tell Big Daddy
we're definitely going to call, okay?

188
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:24,773
What?

189
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,648
Why do you have to act so impressed, man?

190
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,547
Because I am impressed.

191
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:30,917
Whatever.

192
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,524
I'm telling you, that guy Big Daddy,
he's making moves.

193
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:38,791
Trust me, anybody
who self-proclaims himself "Big Daddy"...

194
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,961
is not making moves.

195
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:46,938
- What's so funny?
- You. You and your bout of jealousy.

196
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,440
I'm not having a bout of jealousy.

197
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:53,001
- I'm jealous of what?
- That red Viper, for one thing.

198
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,343
Do you know what a car like that
does to the ozone layer?

199
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,882
Oh, yeah, Captain Environmentalist.

200
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,473
Fuck you, man.

201
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,414
I'm telling you, Big Daddy is the man.

202
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,819
And you know he's putting palm-prints
on that ass every night.

203
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,824
- Not necessarily.
- Oh, necessarily.

204
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,055
- Not necessarily.
- I'm gonna go with "necessarily."

205
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,156
Why must you continue to bust my balls?

206
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,564
- Hey, Rico!
- Speaking of balls.

207
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:18,296
- Hey, Rico.
- Great. Yeah.

208
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,167
Hey, Lisa, how're you doing?

209
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,469
Oh my... Do you know my friend Bobbi?

210
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,840
This is my cousin, Rico. The one
I was telling you about with the big...

211
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,641
- Yeah, what's up?
- Hey, Rico.

212
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,439
Right.

213
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,780
So, how's Uncle Victor?

214
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,082
He's fine. He's still going through chemo.

215
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,644
Rico, are you going to order?

216
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,189
Oh, my God, Larry!

217
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,953
- Oh, my God! Hi!
- Oh!

218
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:44,852
Hey, Lisa.

219
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,797
Larry, I'm so sorry I haven't called you back.

220
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,028
And I know that you've called me
several times...

221
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,899
but I've just been so busy.

222
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,701
Busy, busy, busy, like a busy little bee.

223
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:59,877
Speaking of bees, those flowers
you sent me, they were so beautiful.

224
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,540
Flowers?

225
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,710
You know, we will definitely have to
get together soon. I promise, okay?

226
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,276
I don't want you to think
I'm just some big old tease.

227
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:12,882
Oh, no, no. I've been real busy, too.

228
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,986
Just a busy... Busy little beaver.

229
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,795
Isn't he just edible? I told you.

230
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,461
Oh, yeah, girl. Eat him with a spoon.

231
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,335
You know what, Lisa?

232
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,307
Larry's been talking about you non-stop.

233
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,301
I think he's ready to hook up,
you know what I'm saying?

234
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:37,315
Really? Oh, my God! It sounds so sweet.
I'm excited.

235
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:41,342
I'll call you. All right, boys.
I think it's time for us to go.

236
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,646
We'll see you later.

237
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:43,983
Bye. Bye.

238
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:51,122
- I swear I didn't know.
- Flowers? Come on, man.

239
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,857
Larry, look at me, man.

240
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,991
In the future, try checking the Adam's apple,
all right?

241
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:59,469
And if a chick can palm a basketball
and has more than 1,200 yards...

242
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:03,099
as a receiver in high school,
it's probably a dude, man.

243
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,101
I didn't know.

244
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,758
Welcome to the Chicken Crib.
May I take your order?

245
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,991
Yeah, what's up, man?

246
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:27,030
Let me get two
Colossal Chicken Super-Combos...

247
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,063
and give me a Sprite with that.

248
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,404
Can I get a Chicken Wow special...

249
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:38,704
with extra sauce,
if I could get that cooked fresh.

250
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,745
And hold the spice on the sauce.

251
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:44,340
Actually, you know what?
Just put the sauce on the side.

252
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,881
You know what?
Let's make that sauce from scratch.

253
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:52,481
And I'll have no onions...

254
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:56,186
no green peppers, extra red peppers...

255
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:01,933
order of half-fry-half-onion rings
and the fries extra crispy.

256
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,372
- Anything to drink with that?
- Yeah, Sprite.

257
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,732
$16.71.

258
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,406
- Oh, you must be new.
- Excuse me?

259
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,540
Well, I'm Larry, Jonathan's brother.

260
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,012
- Jonathan's brother?
- Yeah, we usually don't pay.

261
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,417
Oh, I'm sorry.

262
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,291
Yo! Yo, Jonathan!

263
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,754
These peoples with you?

264
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,262
Yeah.

265
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:49,412
Well, congratulations, gentlemen.

266
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,676
You just got yourself a free meal.

267
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,350
Have you even thought about my offer?

268
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:00,586
- What offer, Jon?
- Don't be a butt-frank.

269
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,020
Assistant manager is a coveted position.

270
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,086
Assistant manager is a coveted position?

271
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,893
It's a lot of responsibility...

272
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,696
and you're a completely
underqualified crackhead.

273
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:13,295
But like I said, I could pull some strings
with the regional manager.

274
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,772
So, are you gonna pull strings
for the french-fry girl, too?

275
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,502
Or does she just mainly pull your strings?

276
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,840
- Was I talking to you?
- Just curious.

277
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,005
Yeah. What do you say?

278
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:27,416
Well, firstly, I haven't smoked crack
in like six months.

279
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,283
- Oh, my bad.
- Okay, good.

280
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:30,879
And secondly...

281
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,955
- I lost my train of thought.
- Oh, my God!

282
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,863
That's perfect. That's priceless.

283
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,902
Look at the two of you. Wasting your lives.

284
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:48,865
What the fuck happened to you, pal?
Don't you have any dignity?

285
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,466
- Fuck you, Jon.
- No, you know what? I'm serious.

286
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:54,137
Look at me. I got the houseboat...

287
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:57,546
I got the '77 Trans Am, cherry.

288
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,446
I'm getting chicks.

289
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:04,317
All right? All of my dreams are coming true.

290
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:08,782
So, wait a minute. You actually dreamed
about living on a houseboat...

291
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,886
and owning a '77 Trans Am?

292
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,193
I'm not talking to you, freeloader.

293
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:16,496
Jon, don't you rent the houseboat?

294
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,763
- Irregardless.
- Regardless.

295
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,771
- What?
- Regardless.

296
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,831
"Irregardless" is not a word.
God, that drives me fucking crazy.

297
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,206
Regardless, then.

298
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,541
The point is
you two don't have a pot to piss in.

299
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:32,175
What are you gonna do? Drift around,
smoke dope for the rest of your lives?

300
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,418
Oh, my God.

301
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:41,187
Don't you two have any ambition?
Don't you want to accomplish something?

302
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:45,456
Well, as a matter of fact,
we're going into business for ourselves.

303
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,390
- You're gonna sell drugs again?
- No.

304
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,528
It's tiny classified ads.

305
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,836
Tiny classified ads.

306
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,309
- Ads for what?
- That's not the point, Jon.

307
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,673
- It's complex.
- It's complex?

308
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:07,375
Don't you understand
that with just a little hard work...

309
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:11,718
and discipline, that you could be
sitting right where I am one day?

310
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,491
Don't you see that?

311
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:19,054
Jon, you're the manager
of a goddamn fast-food restaurant!

312
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,156
And when I walked in today,
you were getting blown...

313
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,700
by the retarded french-fry girl!

314
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,702
- She's not retarded!
- You're retarded!

315
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,294
No, fuck you, crackhead!

316
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,498
I told you,
I don't smoke crack anymore, douche-bag!

317
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,337
I don't give a damn if you smoke dick.

318
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,671
Now get the fuck out of my restaurant!

319
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,540
- I'm so sick of your shit!
- I'm sick of yours, too!

320
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,443
This is your last free meal, asshole!

321
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:36,913
You wanna go at me?

322
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,550
So, Big Daddy...

323
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,686
tell me about the new business strategy
you've created.

324
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,024
Well, to tell you the truth,
it was really not a new strategy.

325
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:54,497
I just feel like it's time
to diversify my investments a bit, that's all.

326
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:57,194
Diversify? That sounds great, sweetie.

327
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,696
What are you looking at?

328
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,637
Do you remember that seminar
I went to at the airport last week?

329
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,732
- No.
- Irregardless.

330
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,276
- Regardless.
- Do you understand...

331
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:08,438
the type of money there is to be made
in international real estate?

332
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:11,813
- International real estate?
- Oh, big, big money.

333
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:15,012
Not to mention the perquisites.
Check this out.

334
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,320
What does this look like to you?

335
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:23,451
I don't know,
a beach somewhere in the Third World?

336
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,928
Read my lips.

337
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,830
Nicaragua.

338
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,025
And it's gonna be huge.

339
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:34,334
For 300 grand, I bought 300 acres
of beachfront property down there.

340
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:37,864
- You paid $300,000 for that?
- I know, can you believe it?

341
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,377
And that's just peanuts
compared to what it's gonna be worth...

342
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,810
when I put a resort and a casino on it.

343
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,316
A resort? Don't you think
it's a little bit unstable down there?

344
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,443
What, you mean like earthquakes
and whatnot?

345
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,215
- I mean, like politically.
- Politically?

346
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,185
Wake up and smell the coffee, boo.

347
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,122
We live in a state
where the governor is famous...

348
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,093
for his convincing portrayal of a robot.

349
00:19:56,161 --> 00:20:00,257
In a country that's being run by a man
who almost choked to death on a pretzel.

350
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,924
Need I say more?

351
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:07,097
Okay, so you attended an airport seminar...

352
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,606
and purchased 300 acres...

353
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,803
of beachfront property in Nicaragua
for $300,000.

354
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,345
That's right.

355
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,181
Oh, I see.

356
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,648
Yeah, you know what?

357
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,213
You're absolutely right.

358
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:28,926
What was I thinking? I gotta do more.
I gotta invest it all.

359
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,121
- Everything.
- Wow.

360
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,891
Exactly. Exactly!

361
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,661
Oh, there you go.

362
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,794
Hey, now, you go on
and keep that for yourself, okay?

363
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,929
- Don't spend it all in one place.
- Wow, thanks!

364
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:44,772
Come on, boo. Let's make moves.
We got deals to handle.

365
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:51,112
So, baby, I think I got a buyer
for that coin collection of yours.

366
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,617
You mean my limited-edition
<i>Sanford and Son</i> pieces?

367
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:56,677
No, I mean the Indian Head nickel collection.

368
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,723
Oh, I thought you were talking about
the Susquehannas.

369
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,453
Well, we're talking
some serious dough for those.

370
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:05,519
I can get like $40,000 on eBay
in a heartbeat.

371
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:08,489
- Bet you I can get you more.
- Really?

372
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,268
All right. Well, set up a meeting
with the buyer and I'll talk to him.

373
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:14,464
No, I can't. He's very private.

374
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:18,973
Okay, so how is this deal supposed
to go down if I can't talk to the guy?

375
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,411
Well, I have these two guys.
They can handle everything.

376
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,539
Two guys?

377
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:27,415
Look, baby, trust me, okay? I know them.

378
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,846
Let me do this deal for you.

379
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:33,747
All right, boo. I trust you. It's your deal.

380
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,690
Besides, we can use all the money
we can get down there in Nicaragua.

381
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:46,760
Well, the bottom line is
I finally kicked his ass this time.

382
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:50,137
Oh yeah. You definitely kicked his ass
this time, buddy.

383
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,173
What's up, Lance?

384
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,019
So you had to take it to this, Lance.

385
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,021
You owe me $900.

386
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:09,890
Lance, it clearly states in our lease
that we have until the 5th.

387
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:13,692
And don't bother trying to get your crap
out of here...

388
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:16,393
until you pay me what you owe me.

389
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,736
I could've sworn we had until the 5th.

390
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,300
Come on, man. What're you going to do?

391
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,676
The guy is living in fear, man.

392
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,945
Anybody owe you any money?

393
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,822
Yeah, Steve owes me some jack.

394
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:47,461
Good luck getting that. Steve went AWOL
after the whole Julio fiasco.

395
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,999
Julio fiasco?

396
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,965
Steve walked in on Peggy,
coked out of her mind...

397
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,031
on her knees, blowing Julio.

398
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,200
Blowing Julio?

399
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,772
And then, Julio beat the shit out of Steve...

400
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,744
- put him in the hospital for four months.
- Damn.

401
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,077
I always thought Julio was gay.

402
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,748
Apparently, gay dudes can fight, too.

403
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,321
Times are a-changing.

404
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,097
Spare some change?

405
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,391
- God bless you too, man.
- It's unbelievable.

406
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,230
I know. I can't believe
we're gonna miss <i>The Shank,</i> man.

407
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,997
Yo, Lance is really starting
to piss me off right now.

408
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,698
We gotta find a TV.

409
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,487
You know that Club is worth more
than your car, right?

410
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:44,817
Exactly.

411
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:53,221
Come on.

412
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,708
- I know what this is.
- It's probably your alternator.

413
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:07,801
No...

414
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,906
- this is my bottom.
- Your bottom?

415
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,943
- I mean, my life is a mess, right?
- Well, this is true.

416
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:20,291
The rehab pamphlet says you can't sign up
until you've hit your bottom.

417
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:25,157
I mean, we just got evicted,
the car won't start...

418
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,222
my brother's all up in my shit,
I almost hooked up with a tranny...

419
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,393
and now we're gonna miss <i>The Shank.</i>

420
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,131
Rico, I never miss <i>The Shank.</i>

421
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,540
You know, I'm sitting right next to you
going through the same shit...

422
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,836
in case you didn't notice.

423
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,740
That's good.
You should come to rehab with me.

424
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,143
What else are we gonna do? Look.

425
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,346
"Heavens House."

426
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,649
Probably got some crack whores
that are decent-looking.

427
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:53,290
Yo. Check it, they got cable TV. Yeah.

428
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,560
<i>- The Shank.</i>
<i>- The Shank.</i>

429
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,157
If we check in right now...

430
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:02,723
we can probably catch it before
Tim Robbins even gets raped up the ass.

431
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:37,699
You do realize they probably charge
for this bullshit, right?

432
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:39,100
You think?

433
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,568
Dude, I'm gonna bust your ass
in Ping-Pong.

434
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,672
George Jefferson?

435
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,795
Hold on. I'm gonna be right back, okay?
Hold on.

436
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,666
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yeah, hi.

437
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,069
We're here about the rehab.

438
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:16,471
Yeah, so, who do we see
about this rehab situation?

439
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:19,667
That would be me. I'm Montana.
And you are...

440
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,648
Red. Red.

441
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,144
- Nice to meet you, Red.
- Yeah, I'm Red.

442
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,206
Red.

443
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,313
And your name is?

444
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,117
Andy...

445
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:35,754
Dufresne.

446
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:39,124
- Nice to meet you, Andy.
- Nice to meet you.

447
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,995
Okay, well, we can take care of you both.

448
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,394
- Let's start with you. Please follow me.
- Okay.

449
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:54,636
You were really in The Pharcyde?
That's amazing.

450
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:58,373
It's a pleasure
to have you here with us, Red...

451
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,850
and I know you're gonna enjoy your stay.

452
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,786
And I just have to say,
I am a huge fan of your dad's work...

453
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:07,120
and I'm just so glad to be able to help
in any way I can.

454
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:10,719
Well, thank you so much, Montana.

455
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:14,128
I'm sure my dad
would be extremely grateful.

456
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:16,923
That's enough. Okay.

457
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:19,367
Mr. Dufresne, please come on in.

458
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:22,265
- Go get 'em, Andy.
- Thanks, Red.

459
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,967
No problem, Andy.

460
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:27,573
Newton's cradle. Sweet.

461
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,715
So, Andy, any major illnesses?

462
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,377
Major? No.

463
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,684
- Clinical depression?
- Clinical?

464
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:41,282
No.

465
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:44,021
- God, this is incredible.
- Isn't it?

466
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,356
How does it work?

467
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:49,261
Nobody really knows.

468
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,665
Holy shit!

469
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:55,471
Well, it's odd that way.
It has a lot to do with surrender.

470
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,232
- Higher power. Letting go of our own will.
- Really?

471
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:03,239
God, I would have thought it was
something to do with gravity or inertia...

472
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:05,339
you know, something stupid like that.

473
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:09,319
Well, gravity is a factor.
We're not getting any younger, are we?

474
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:12,879
And inertia, don't get me started.
Inertia is a killer.

475
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,823
You know, I think
you're really gonna get this thing, Andy.

476
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,226
- Really?
- Yeah.

477
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,956
Now, just a few more medical questions...

478
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,659
and I poke my finger up your butt,
and we're all set.

479
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,099
All right.

480
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,835
Oh, that was a joke.

481
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:29,128
Oh.

482
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,478
You can, if you need to.

483
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:40,284
Thanks, sweetie. I think I'll pass.

484
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:43,852
Oh, speaking of which, STDs?

485
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,991
I once had the skin on my entire ball bag...

486
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,361
peel off in one piece.

487
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,490
When was this?

488
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:00,737
Oh, God, I don't know.
Four or five years ago.

489
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:02,796
Did you get it checked out?

490
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:08,643
It was a crazy time.
Yeah, I probably should've seen a doctor.

491
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,476
Probably.

492
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:13,116
Okay, your drug of choice?

493
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,619
- What do you got?
- No, I'm serious.

494
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,250
Me, too.

495
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:22,891
Your favorite drug. We just like to know.

496
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:27,827
It's hard to say.
There are so many great ones.

497
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,635
Ecstasy is pretty damn good.

498
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,272
Although coke is solid...

499
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:40,368
you know, just consistent.

500
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,711
But pot... I mean, pot's the mainstay.

501
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,776
You know, at the baseline. The old friend.

502
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,914
Welcome to Heavens House.

503
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:56,249
- I got in?
- Yeah.

504
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,566
- Television.
- Quick, pop on <i>The Shank.</i>

505
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,941
Group in one minute.

506
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:18,176
And guys, I'm leaving for the day,
so I'll see you tomorrow morning.

507
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,248
I guess we're gonna have to watch
<i>The Shank</i> after group.

508
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,383
- Group?
- Who you think we're grouping anyway?

509
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,625
I don't know, but I wouldn't mind
grouping Montana's ass.

510
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:38,200
Oh, hey, real quick.
You were kidding earlier, right?

511
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:39,697
About what?

512
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:42,740
When you said that Andy Dufresne
gets raped in <i>The Shank.</i>

513
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:44,274
You're kidding.

514
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,175
Andy Dufresne does not get raped
in <i>The Shank.</i>

515
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,041
Come on, man. Of course he does.

516
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:52,549
I've seen the movie like 100 times
and I have never seen that.

517
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:55,586
What do you mean?
It's like a major plot point.

518
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:58,383
It's the whole reason
he decides to escape prison.

519
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,048
It's his motive.

520
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,619
Tim Robbins gets ass-fucked?

521
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:11,294
Maybe TNT doesn't show that part.
How does he live with himself?

522
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,461
It's a movie, Larry.

523
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,027
<i>Group in one minute.</i>

524
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,139
But it only happens once, right?

525
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:21,473
Okay...

526
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:25,147
let's welcome Heavens House's
newest family members...

527
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,706
Andy and Red.

528
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,320
Nice. Okay, why don't you guys
all just introduce yourselves, huh?

529
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,586
To our newest patients? Otis, you start.

530
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,252
Okay, all right.

531
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,929
Otis Jackson, Jr. here.

532
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:44,499
I'm an Aquarius with Capricorn tendencies.

533
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,494
I'm just playing.

534
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:51,437
I guess I'm your regular garden-variety,
straight-up dope fiend.

535
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:54,972
Been addicted to crack, smack,
uppers, downers...

536
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,804
booze, gambling, hookers.

537
00:31:56,881 --> 00:32:00,817
Hell, you name it,
I either sniffed it, shot it, smoked it...

538
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,576
or screwed it.

539
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,648
All right! Otis, my man! That's what
I'm talking about, brother. Right on.

540
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,821
Everybody, let's settle down, okay?

541
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,292
Let's just try and keep it real simple.

542
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:16,555
Heather.

543
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,494
Hello, my name is Heather...

544
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,438
and I've been addicted to food, drugs...

545
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,167
men.

546
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,744
But, I guess I'm really
just a booze hound at heart. Okay.

547
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:33,376
Jeff.

548
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:41,990
Jeff J. Johnson, Esquire.
I have my own law practice.

549
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:46,051
I'm your basic tweaker.
You know, crystal, speed, junk.

550
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,825
Anything to crank me up.

551
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,594
It's all good.

552
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,964
David.

553
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,031
Yo, what's up? I'm Dave.

554
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:59,368
And I ain't no damn drug addict.

555
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:03,873
Andy?

556
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:07,874
Hi, my name is Andy.

557
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:11,017
And I put down weed as my drug of choice.

558
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,488
Bingo.

559
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,148
I don't have any STDs...

560
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:19,556
although the skin of my entire ball bag
fell off, one time.

561
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,562
And Red and I have our own
"tiny classified ads" business.

562
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,731
Well, that's great, Andy.

563
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:33,610
Ads for what?

564
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:36,572
Well, you see, Linda, that's not the point.

565
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,114
It's complex.

566
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:39,508
Okay.

567
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:41,946
Well...

568
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:46,245
yesterday, we were discussing
David's upcoming court case.

569
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:49,725
- How is that progressing, David?
- It's progressing, all right.

570
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,658
They talking about locking my ass up.

571
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:52,787
Oh, man!

572
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,632
How does that make you feel?

573
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,693
Makes me feel like they talking about
locking my ass up. What?

574
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,798
See now, that's your problem, Dave.

575
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,472
- You're cut off emotionally.
- Please.

576
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,138
See, that's just a defense there, all right?

577
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,408
That is your anger coming up.

578
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,014
Okay, now, we talked about this.

579
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,946
No. It's not my anger, Linda.

580
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,855
Fuck, if I go to jail, I go to jail, right?
That's the facts.

581
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,990
I meant, how I'm gonna feel...

582
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,592
I know...

583
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:34,865
you're the reason
why I don't want to go to jail.

584
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:39,399
You're my French vanilla,
my white chocolate...

585
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,337
you're my<i>... Ay, qué linda.</i>

586
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:43,607
Linda.

587
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:53,520
But you know.
If I go to jail, I just go to jail.

588
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:02,958
Would either one of you
care to share one of your stories...

589
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:06,969
of incarceration on a group level? Okay?

590
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,474
I'll share on a group level.

591
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,836
This may come as a surprise
to some of you...

592
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,605
but I've done a stretch of time.

593
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,512
And let me tell you, as a lawyer,
it's no picnic.

594
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:22,417
Feel free to contact me anytime
regarding representation.

595
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,782
That's right, anytime.

596
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,449
- Jeff.
- Call the number on it.

597
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:31,323
- We talked about this.
- Right, right, okay.

598
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,289
Okay, right. Good.

599
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:36,162
Well, listen, I'd love to sit around
and chat with you guys...

600
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:37,733
tell some war stories...

601
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:41,294
but I've got some calls to make,
got a few cases out there just busting open.

602
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:43,772
So I'll catch up with you later.

603
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,174
He busted.

604
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:57,043
Now, wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute.

605
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,422
Wait a minute, here. Jeff, sit. Okay?

606
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,891
Now, Jeff just got done sharing
something on a group level.

607
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:10,332
And I don't find anything funny about it.

608
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,401
Trust me, Linda. It's funny.

609
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,098
Really? Then why don't you go ahead
and tell one of your stories.

610
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,107
I bet it is hilarious.

611
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:20,936
Okay.

612
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,175
It may come as a surprise to some of you...

613
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:30,186
but Red and I did a stretch of time
together, a few years ago.

614
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:33,051
In the great state of Maine.

615
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:36,449
I was framed for killing my wife.

616
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,856
Don't worry, I didn't do it.

617
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:43,433
Me? Hell...

618
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:47,263
just a punk kid,
grew up on the wrong side of the tracks.

619
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:50,730
I broke out eventually.
Flew the coop. Escaped.

620
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,399
Headed on down to the islands.

621
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:55,639
Yeah, you see,
he was being repeatedly gang-raped.

622
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:57,410
- Whoa.
- That's terrible.

623
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,278
- I was not!
- You were too.

624
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,715
I don't remember that part!

625
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:04,312
Andy, most people,
they do block that out, okay?

626
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,618
But, it's nothing to be ashamed of,
all right? Go ahead.

627
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,318
Thank you, Linda.

628
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,320
As I was saying...

629
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,657
I had the most amazing poster
of Bo Derek...

630
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,491
that I put up on my wall to cover...

631
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,365
<i>Shawshank Redemption!</i>

632
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:22,829
- Aren't you guys playing Scattergories?
- Chet!

633
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:27,441
And Andy, we are not here to play games.
Sit it.

634
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:31,979
I take your recovery very seriously...

635
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:33,778
even if you choose not to.

636
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:34,875
Okay?

637
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,280
And as for you,
if you won't tell... Yeah!

638
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:44,391
If you won't tell your story, then maybe
I'll be forced to, Mr. Redd Foxx, Jr!

639
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:48,330
- Okay.
- No, snowflake, wait.

640
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,195
Redd Foxx, Jr?

641
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,701
I couldn't remember Red's last name, man,
so I improvised.

642
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,536
With Redd Foxx, Jr?

643
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,406
Listen up, drug addicts,
we have two more hours of free time...

644
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:01,968
and that's it!

645
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:04,979
We have a very big day tomorrow.

646
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:23,293
Look, man. You know...
Oh, what's up?

647
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:27,095
Man, you know who that is?

648
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:29,503
That's the Mayor's daughter, man.

649
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:30,835
How do you know that?

650
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:33,035
I keeps up with my politics.

651
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:36,703
Besides, I never had any
political poon-tang before.

652
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,146
Don't you think she's
a little out of your league?

653
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:42,310
Please.

654
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:45,685
In case you didn't notice,
we in drug rehab, man.

655
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:50,256
Besides, I voted for her wack-ass dad.
The way I see it, she owes me.

656
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:00,461
You guys really made me laugh
in there. Thanks.

657
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:03,735
That was the first time in weeks.
Name's Heather.

658
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:07,039
Hello, Heather. I'm Andy Dufresne.

659
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,204
So, Mr. Dufresne...

660
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:12,878
got any idea where a big girl like me...

661
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,180
can find some long, hard dick?

662
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,753
I'll tell you.

663
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,787
So, you know I'm a big fan
of your dad's, too.

664
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,456
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

665
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:32,061
You know, I was thinking,
we should probably stick together...

666
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:35,264
seeing that we're the only two
from prominent families in here.

667
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,000
- Right.
- Yeah.

668
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:40,339
Why don't you stop by later?
I have a private room.

669
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:45,241
A private room?
Okay, I like the sound of that.

670
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:49,252
- We could read Bible verses together.
- Bible verses?

671
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:53,187
Hey, cool. I'm into the whole Jesus thing.

672
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:54,747
- Really?
- Yeah.

673
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,394
So, I'll see you later tonight?

674
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:59,292
Oh, you'll see lots of me.

675
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:01,194
- Okay, then.
- All right.

676
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:08,668
- You running group tonight?
- Yeah.

677
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,677
So, did you French kiss?

678
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:17,280
No. Did I French kiss? No, man.

679
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:22,213
I'm heading over there later
to read Bible verses.

680
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,220
Bible verses?

681
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,218
So, what's up with Big Drawers?

682
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:33,462
Well, apparently she's looking
for some long, hard dick.

683
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,269
Can you believe those people in there?

684
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,964
And my brother calls me a crackhead.

685
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:46,436
I mean, I told him, I haven't smoked crack
in like six months.

686
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,841
Excuse me.

687
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:51,375
- Is that reefer I smell?
- No, sir.

688
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,249
Don't lie to an old man, boy. It ain't right.

689
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,049
You selfish bastards!

690
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,056
You all gonna stand out here
and smoke a joint...

691
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,422
and ain't gonna ask an old man
if he want a hit?

692
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,461
You want a hit, old man?

693
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,962
Does a crack whore's pussy stink?

694
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,200
I'm a drug addict, son. I always want a hit.

695
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:15,633
- Told you we could get high in rehab.
- No, you can't.

696
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,172
Your buddy's right there, partner.

697
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:21,609
I mean, I like to smoke a little reefer
from time to time, but that's it.

698
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,944
Folks around here take getting high
pretty serious.

699
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:31,076
I'm reminded of a time in 1968...

700
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:34,187
No, it was '74.

701
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:37,584
Anyway, I was doing a gig
down in Mississippi.

702
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:42,226
I'll never forget it, 'cause that was
the first time I got crabs.

703
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,068
I used to sing tenor.

704
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,306
- You hear that?
- That's it, honey.

705
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:57,541
Come on.

706
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,718
Take the tank top off.

707
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:08,085
That's it. Nice and slow.

708
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:11,686
You know who the daddy is,
don't you, Dave?

709
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:13,622
- Dave?
- Dave?

710
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,889
Who's out there?

711
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,066
What are you guys doing out here?

712
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:20,831
No, the question is, what the hell
are you doing over there?

713
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:24,136
Just mind your own business.
Go back inside!

714
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:27,100
Drug addicts!

715
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:30,776
Oh, Chet.

716
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,457
What the hell is that smell?

717
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:51,865
Hai Karate.

718
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:56,565
Hai Karate?
Where do they still sell Hai Karate?

719
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,939
eBay. A man has to understand
his pheromones, brother.

720
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:03,343
- Hey, what channel is TNT?
- I don't know. Try 66.

721
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:09,179
There is no 66.
This thing has only got like eight channels.

722
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:12,051
Eight channels? Wait a minute, man.

723
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,153
Give me that thing.

724
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,293
What the hell?

725
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:23,459
It clearly states in the brochure
that they have basic cable.

726
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:26,092
I believe that's false advertising.

727
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,867
I tell you what, if they don't have
TNT in here by tomorrow...

728
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:31,302
I'm out.

729
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:36,271
And I don't give a damn about your bottom
or anybody else's goddamn bottom!

730
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,007
Kiss my ass, man.

731
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,358
Come in.

732
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:59,634
- I catch you at a bad time?
- Of course not.

733
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,939
So, what you reading?

734
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:04,897
The Good Book.

735
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:07,810
Does your "good book" have a name?

736
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:12,546
Oh, the Good Book! Right.

737
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,444
Don't just stand there. Come sit down.

738
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:26,825
Read this part I highlighted.

739
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,458
Okay. Right here?

740
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:31,491
All right.

741
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:35,436
"Every man is tempted,
when he is drawn away...

742
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,965
"of his own lust, and enticed."

743
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,935
So true. So true.

744
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:48,952
"Then, when lust hath conceived,
it bringeth forth sin."

745
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,714
Sin. It's true.

746
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:56,522
"And sin, when it is finished,
bringeth forth death."

747
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:59,558
Death. I guess that's true.

748
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:04,027
You smell so good, Red.

749
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:08,231
What is that smell? It's so familiar.

750
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:13,739
I got to run. I really got to run.

751
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:31,257
So, are you gonna let me in
or not, handsome?

752
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:33,185
Oh.

753
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:34,556
Yeah.

754
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,733
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

755
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,141
What's the verdict, Andy-boy?

756
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:56,118
The verdict?

757
00:45:57,454 --> 00:46:02,016
You think you're ready for some
of this big-girl pussy, or what?

758
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:05,824
You so crazy.

759
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,455
Oh, I'm deadly serious.

760
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,201
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

761
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:14,095
I'm like a dog...

762
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:17,205
with a bone.

763
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:20,268
- What's the matter, Red?
- I just remembered...

764
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:23,507
<i>Shawshank Redemption</i> is on tonight.
Great movie.

765
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,948
- We don't have TNT.
- Oh, yeah?

766
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,816
But I've got something better than TNT.

767
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:37,788
You like my outfit?

768
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,496
It's fantastic. It's fabulous.

769
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:43,726
It's a very, very good look for you.

770
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,928
Know the best part about it?

771
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,562
It's crotchless.

772
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,831
Jesus. Jesus.

773
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:56,803
Forgive me my sins, Jesus.

774
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,041
Yes, yes, yes, my child.

775
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:01,607
No. Call me Mary Magdalene.

776
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,955
Don't be afraid, my child. I mean, Mary.

777
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:20,464
Excuse me. Could you untie me, please?

778
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:24,401
- Sure, Jesus. Anything for you.
- No, no.

779
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,968
It's Red. Just...

780
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:29,669
Okay, Jesus.

781
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,613
It's Red.

782
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,446
- Just... Please?
- Jesus.

783
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:11,511
I think I love her, buddy.

784
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:17,352
<i>Code blue. Code blue.</i>

785
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:22,393
- Where are we going?
- Down the hall and to your left.

786
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:23,956
Got it. Bring it around.

787
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:27,401
- Chet, what's going on?
- It's Otis. He tried to hang himself.

788
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:31,597
Why would Otis try to hang himself?

789
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:36,542
Maybe he couldn't hack it on the outside.

790
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,378
Like old Brooksie in <i>The Shank.</i>

791
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:41,874
<i>Probably right.</i>

792
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:43,986
<i>Packed up his things...</i>

793
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,384
<i>combed his hair...</i>

794
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:49,450
<i>carved his name above the window.</i>

795
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:53,395
Just like old Brooksie.

796
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,218
Are you two idiots finished?

797
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:26,457
- Screw you, Chet.
- Promises, promises.

798
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:29,624
Do realize what that drug addict
did to himself?

799
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:39,239
<i>Otis has some real issues</i>
<i>you might not be aware of.</i>

800
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:45,170
Be quiet!

801
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,478
All right.

802
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:58,154
Look at you. Oh, look at you.

803
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:07,796
I can't wait.

804
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,310
Sweet dreams, drug addicts.

805
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:38,196
Good morning, sweetheart.

806
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:42,338
What you doing in here? You can't
just come in here without knocking.

807
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:45,898
Yes, I can. I can do whatever I want.

808
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:50,471
- What's the big deal?
- Oh, honey...

809
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,741
there's clearly no big deal here.

810
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:54,545
I am so not impressed.

811
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:59,246
Montana wants to see you in her office
in 20 minutes, drug addicts.

812
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:03,254
Hell, man. That cat is creepy.

813
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,257
As I'm sure you probably know...

814
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:10,527
there was a special last night
on <i>E! True Hollywood Story...</i>

815
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,694
documenting the life of Redd Foxx.

816
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,936
Is there anything you want to tell me?

817
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:18,304
Yes, as a matter of fact, there is, Montana.

818
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:21,435
I am very, very disappointed...

819
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:24,378
in the supposed cable service in here.

820
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:27,848
Now, I'm no expert,
but to the best of my knowledge...

821
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,648
TNT is considered basic cable...

822
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,314
in every major market in the U.S.

823
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:36,886
- Is that a fact?
- Oh, yeah. Definitely.

824
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:40,188
It's common knowledge. Maybe you should
call them 'cause, you know...

825
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:43,892
that's false advertising. I mean, you guys
could get in a lot of trouble behind that.

826
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:47,425
You know, he's right about that. You know,
'cause we know a lot about advertising.

827
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:51,065
- We have a "tiny classified ads" business.
- Really? Ads for what?

828
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:53,541
That's not the point, Montana. It's complex.

829
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,134
Montana, the bottom line is this.

830
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:58,579
We're not going to be able to continue
staying here under these conditions.

831
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:03,379
Hello.

832
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:06,419
I knew it.

833
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:09,247
Yes. Thank you for calling me back.

834
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:12,889
Really? You don't?

835
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:17,922
Never mind.
Thanks again for calling me back. Bye-bye.

836
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,667
So look...

837
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:24,403
you're gonna handle
that cable situation, right?

838
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,806
How does this thing work again?

839
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:28,640
Give me that.

840
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:33,276
You and your goddamn bottom.

841
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:37,786
- You know this is all your fault, right?
- What? How do you figure that?

842
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:40,515
Man, you're the one
that got us to go to rehab.

843
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:43,024
"Yeah, Rico, they got cable."

844
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:46,093
Eight fucking channels is not cable, Larry.

845
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:49,155
Well, excuse me, Mr. Redd Foxx, Jr.

846
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:54,101
You know, you didn't help matters much
by firing up a spliff in Montana's office.

847
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:02,672
I can't believe you did that.

848
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:05,374
Did you see Montana's face, man?

849
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:09,051
You know, but seriously...

850
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,054
- that is false advertising, though.
- Oh, I concur.

851
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:19,526
- So where you want to go now?
- I don't know.

852
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:21,393
What about Big Daddy?

853
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:25,967
Excellent point, my friend.
A guy like that probably has DirecTV.

854
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,731
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

855
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:30,939
- You got his number?
- It's in the glove box.

856
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,774
Yeah, I got it.

857
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,250
Got it right here.

858
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,487
So, what do you think?
Should we call Big Daddy?

859
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,528
Well, his address is right here on the card.

860
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:55,427
- Let's just head over there.
- Good.

861
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:58,331
- I gotta take a shit anyway.
- Let's roll.

862
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:27,623
Now, that's class.

863
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:30,931
Easy, Killer.

864
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:33,526
- Yeah, easy, Killer.
- Can I help you?

865
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,097
Yeah, we're Elise's friends.

866
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:41,767
Oh, yeah! Chico and the Man!
You're the two guys Elise was talking about.

867
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:43,843
Welcome to La Casa de Big Daddy.

868
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:47,212
Come on. Let me show you around.
Come on in, fellas.

869
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:54,853
And last but not least, fellas,
here's Big Daddy's den.

870
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:59,584
Wow. Now, this is luxurious.

871
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:01,921
I could definitely live here.

872
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:04,330
Well, with a lot of hard work,
one day you probably can.

873
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:06,369
Come on in. Have a seat, fellas.

874
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:09,798
So...

875
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:12,770
correct me if I'm wrong, but you're
the small-business owners, right?

876
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:15,436
Right. We have
a "tiny classified ads" business.

877
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:18,913
That's right. Now I remember.
Sounds like it might be fairly profitable.

878
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:22,543
Most definitely.
You see, the ads themselves...

879
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,784
- they generate income.
- Yeah, Big Daddy...

880
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:27,746
it's complex.

881
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:30,453
Complex?

882
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:35,026
I see. I like that.

883
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:37,491
Hey, Elise, what do you think
about the word "complex"?

884
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,194
Nothing, really.

885
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,298
What are they doing here?

886
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:43,396
What are you talking about?
They're gonna do the deal.

887
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:45,839
- The deal? No, these aren't the guys.
- And they couldn't be better.

888
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,503
Finally, some guys
who understand business.

889
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:50,603
We were just going over
their tiny classified ads.

890
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:51,869
They say it's complex.

891
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:57,010
- Right. Ads for what?
- You see, that's not the point, boo.

892
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,587
It's complex.

893
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:01,382
You see, Elise, the ads themselves...

894
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:05,322
- they generate income.
- Generate income from what?

895
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,826
Ads is short for advertisement.

896
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:10,429
Ads mean nothing
unless you're advertising something.

897
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:14,300
So, if you're not advertising anything,
then there is no income to generate.

898
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,032
Yeah, but it's complex.

899
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,500
Don't you understand? Complex.

900
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:24,306
Anyway, back to the business at hand.

901
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,781
Now, I'm pretty sure Elise
has filled you guys in on the particulars.

902
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:28,477
- No, actually, Big Daddy, I haven't.
- Hold it a minute, boo.

903
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:29,677
I know I told you it's your deal...

904
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:32,813
but just let me show these fellas
the merchandise. Then you can take over.

905
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,652
Now check this out.

906
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:40,760
Here are my precious babies.

907
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:43,859
Now...

908
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:46,333
Elise told me you can get around $50,000,
which sounds nice...

909
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:49,133
but of course, you're going to have to make
an appraisal yourselves...

910
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:51,673
before you can take them to your guy.
So, come on, boo...

911
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,641
let's give these gentlemen a few minutes...

912
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:56,235
then I'll let you take over
and tell them what they need to know.

913
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:02,076
I'll be back in a minute, fellas.

914
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:09,817
What was that all about? Coins?

915
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:13,328
Where are we going to get $50,000?

916
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:16,422
What?

917
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:20,100
Oh, my God.

918
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:23,170
We're going to watch <i>The Shank.</i>

919
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:26,367
Hey, it's me. Well, the deal changed.

920
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:29,637
I'll fill you in. I said I'd fill you in later.

921
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,441
I gotta go. Somebody's on the other line.

922
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:33,709
Hello?

923
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:35,744
Hey, girl.

924
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,886
No, nothing.

925
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:41,486
How come every man in my life is a moron?

926
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:45,986
- Rico, man, how do you turn this thing on?
- I don't know. Damn.

927
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:48,553
- Press the button.
- Try the... No, that's not it. Try the...

928
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,793
No, dude. What...

929
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:56,968
- So what do you think?
- About what?

930
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,270
The coins. Is $50,000 fair?

931
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:02,102
Yeah.

932
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:05,740
Yeah, I saw you looking
at that stereo equipment. You like it?

933
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:06,873
Yes.

934
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:10,051
Picked that bad boy up
down in Tokyo, Japan.

935
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:11,586
<i>Oh, Big Daddy.</i>

936
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:14,679
<i>Oh, Big Daddy.</i>

937
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:16,088
Yeah. Hold on one second.

938
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:20,255
Hey, listen guys, I got to take this, okay?
Elise will fill you in on all the details.

939
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,127
See you fellas later.

940
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:25,665
Okay, about these <i>Sanford and Son</i> pieces.
Now, how much can I get for Lamont?

941
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:28,133
What the fuck is wrong with the two of you?

942
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:29,466
Nothing.

943
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:37,704
- Is something burning?
- I don't smell anything.

944
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:39,674
I farted earlier.

945
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:45,220
Okay, here's the deal. All right?

946
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:49,891
Take the briefcase to the Mex-A-Go-Go
bus station, 12:00 noon tomorrow.

947
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:52,359
Don't sit there with it,
'cause I'm afraid you'll lose it.

948
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:55,591
Now, put it in a locker and take the key
and give it to a guy. You follow?

949
00:58:57,767 --> 00:58:58,756
Yes.

950
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,600
Any guy?

951
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,305
The guy you'll be meeting is very big,
with lots of tattoos.

952
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,140
You cannot miss him. Okay?

953
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:12,272
Like I said,
take the briefcase, put it in a locker.

954
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:15,806
Take the key, give it to the guy,
the very big guy with the big tattoos.

955
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,648
The guy'll give you
a package filled with money.

956
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:19,352
It's a very simple exchange.

957
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,049
Got me?

958
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,583
You can go now.

959
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:26,859
Yep. Got it.

960
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:36,200
Goodbye.

961
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:51,479
So...

962
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,118
Elise, this where you spend
most of your nights?

963
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:57,819
None of your goddamn business.
I'll see you two tomorrow.

964
00:59:57,894 --> 01:00:00,055
Hey, Elise, thanks a lot for everything.

965
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:02,461
Don't thank me.
You're Big Daddy's pawns, not mine.

966
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:04,659
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I ain't nobody's pawn, baby.

967
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:07,395
Right.

968
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:20,504
Elise.

969
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:22,983
Yeah, I'm about to break it off
with her anyway, man.

970
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:24,917
No, she's right there.

971
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:46,772
Nice car.

972
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:51,176
Better not fuck this up.

973
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:52,680
Don't worry.

974
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:56,881
We won't fuck it up.

975
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:01,814
No, no. Get out and push.

976
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,920
Hey, it's me. Yeah.
Pick-up's tomorrow at noon.

977
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,294
Just give them the package
and take the key...

978
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:11,230
and I'll take care of the rest. All right.

979
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:25,438
Man, I hope your brother
doesn't start in on that shit again.

980
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,346
Yeah, well, he's probably going to.

981
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:29,612
Kind of out of options.
Where else are we gonna stay?

982
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:34,089
- I just don't feel like hearing it. That's all.
- At least he's got a TV.

983
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:35,783
Shit.

984
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:40,726
- Think he's dead?
- I don't know.

985
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:51,232
Jeff?

986
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,234
Oh, hey, fellas.

987
01:01:58,081 --> 01:01:59,343
God damn!

988
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,708
What happened?

989
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,054
I must have fallen or something.

990
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:10,052
Hey, man, you all right?

991
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:11,650
Sure, fine.

992
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:13,428
Fine. Thanks.

993
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:15,559
How you guys doing?

994
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:18,496
Hey, what are you doing out of rehab?

995
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,263
Montana gave us the boot.

996
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:23,396
What about you?

997
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,171
Graduated.

998
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:27,709
- Graduated?
- Yeah.

999
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:28,971
Really?

1000
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:30,974
Oh, shit.

1001
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:33,341
Look at the time.

1002
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:36,680
I got to be in court in like 45 minutes.

1003
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:39,079
As a lawyer or a defendant?

1004
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:41,616
That's funny. No.

1005
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:44,053
I'm trying this really big case.

1006
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:47,060
Just stopped in for a little power nap,
you know?

1007
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:48,495
Freshen up.

1008
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:51,532
Hey, listen, you guys, call me, okay?

1009
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,932
Cell phone, call me.

1010
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:56,403
We'll hang, catch up. Okay.

1011
01:02:58,674 --> 01:02:59,936
Oh, Jeff.

1012
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:01,535
Yeah.

1013
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,844
What a dick.

1014
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:11,516
Well, well, well, look who it is.

1015
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:13,214
Frick and Frack.

1016
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:15,789
- What's going on, Jon?
- What's it look like?

1017
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,917
Grab a couple of rags. Help me finish.

1018
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:24,928
Care to join us
for a couple of brewskis, ladies?

1019
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:27,228
I don't think so.

1020
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:31,205
- That's nasty.
- Real smooth there, Jon.

1021
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:33,498
Fucking dykes.

1022
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:37,608
Oh, no, you two can't stay here tonight.
Out of the question.

1023
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:41,639
- It's just for one night.
- No. I need you out of here ASAP.

1024
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,483
- What's wrong with your TV, Jon?
- What do you mean?

1025
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:46,351
You don't have cable?

1026
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:49,258
This is a houseboat, idiot.

1027
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:51,793
Besides, what do you think I am?
Made of money?

1028
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:53,158
Listen...

1029
01:03:53,796 --> 01:03:55,889
Paulie's bringing over
a couple of hot chicks tonight...

1030
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:59,128
and I can't have you two fuck-ups
lurking around.

1031
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,770
Well, where do you expect us to go?

1032
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,136
Don't ask me. Homeless shelter?

1033
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:07,241
So, who are these chicks you speak of, Jon?

1034
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:10,575
Just a couple of hotties we met last week
over at the Dusty Whale.

1035
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:13,080
And they are H-O-T, my friend.

1036
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:16,050
- Oh, I bet they are.
- That's right! They are!

1037
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:18,177
If you got your shit together...

1038
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:21,155
you could be living
the same kind of life I am.

1039
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:23,124
I'm telling you guys...

1040
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,324
I am a major player over here.

1041
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:28,259
Hey Jon, we're here!

1042
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:32,932
I'm coming right down.

1043
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:41,702
You guys gotta get out of here.

1044
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:42,869
All right.

1045
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:45,479
Come on aboard, everybody. Yeah.

1046
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:52,918
You ladies ready to get down
on the poop deck?

1047
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:56,457
You ready for some sailing lessons?

1048
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:01,228
What the fuck are they doing here?

1049
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:03,162
They were just leaving.

1050
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:07,432
Rico? Larry? Oh, my God!

1051
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:09,401
I can't believe this.

1052
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,872
You guys. Are you stalking us?

1053
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:14,172
Do we have stalkers?

1054
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,505
Looks like you do.

1055
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:18,775
- You all know each other?
- Yes, Rico is my cousin.

1056
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:22,142
This is such a small world.

1057
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:24,778
Are you guys going to hang out with us?

1058
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:26,822
No. They're not.

1059
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:28,318
Yeah, no.

1060
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:32,623
- I gotta go.
- Don't leave on account of us.

1061
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:35,562
- Yeah. Leave on account of us.
- Yeah. Leave on account of...

1062
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:37,690
We'll leave you lovebirds alone.

1063
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:40,827
Don't let the gangplank
hit you on the way out.

1064
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:43,730
You guys have a ball. Or two.

1065
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:48,801
Or eight.

1066
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:57,819
Let's get down. This is gonna get funky.

1067
01:05:58,521 --> 01:06:01,490
Man, your brother is a fucking retard.

1068
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:04,918
- No offense.
- Believe me, none taken.

1069
01:06:06,028 --> 01:06:07,655
So where to now?

1070
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:09,698
I guess back to the car.

1071
01:06:09,765 --> 01:06:12,165
- Man, that's rough.
- Yeah, I know.

1072
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:15,095
But while I'm sleeping in that car...

1073
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:18,902
it will comfort me knowing that Jonathan's
getting a special private performance...

1074
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,442
of <i>The Crying Game.</i>

1075
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:22,909
- Live and uncut.
- Holler.

1076
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:40,117
Larry.

1077
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:42,090
Larry.

1078
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:54,870
Hey! Get out of here, man. Get...

1079
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:04,510
Hey.

1080
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:07,215
Hey, man, I'm trying to sleep in here.

1081
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,051
Steve?

1082
01:07:11,227 --> 01:07:12,922
Rico. Hey.

1083
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:15,830
Man. Larry.

1084
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:18,563
Larry. Steve, man.

1085
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:26,006
Steve? What's up, dude?

1086
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:27,932
Fucking Julio.

1087
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:30,779
- I heard, I heard.
- Yeah?

1088
01:07:30,946 --> 01:07:34,473
How come you two never came to visit me
in the hospital, then?

1089
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:38,886
- We've been real busy, Steve.
- Right. Right.

1090
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:41,513
- After I gave you my apartment, too.
- Wait, wait, wait, Steve.

1091
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:44,889
You didn't give us the apartment.
We took over the lease, man.

1092
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,257
That's what I meant.

1093
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:49,525
You're living in the past, Steve.
You've gotta snap out of it, baby.

1094
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:51,225
Look at yourself.

1095
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:55,031
What happened to your shoes, Steve?

1096
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:59,165
Well, take a good look, all right?
Because this could happen to any one of us.

1097
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:02,733
- I don't think so, Steve.
- There's some crazy "Steve" shit right here.

1098
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:05,610
Well, I gather neither one of you
is gonna break off a few bucks...

1099
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:07,808
for an old friend who's, you know,
down on his luck?

1100
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:10,977
No. Matter of fact,
you got that $10 you owe me?

1101
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:14,711
You know what, man?
God bless you two assholes, okay?

1102
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:17,884
I pray you never
have to walk in my shoes. Okay?

1103
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:19,954
Steve!

1104
01:08:20,296 --> 01:08:23,459
That's the point, man.
You have no fucking shoes!

1105
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:29,436
What a dick.

1106
01:08:30,139 --> 01:08:31,470
Oh, Steve.

1107
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:39,913
Makes me feel better
about sleeping in your piece-of-shit car.

1108
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:41,208
Yeah.

1109
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:44,277
What time is it?

1110
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:49,880
- Time for me to drop the kids off at the pool.
- Let's roll.

1111
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:01,329
...waiting all day!

1112
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:04,201
For the love of God!
What's taking him so long?

1113
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:07,303
Come on.

1114
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:10,310
- Good morning.
<i>- Ay, caramba!</i>

1115
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:13,508
Oh my God! Who did that?

1116
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:18,408
Hey...

1117
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,014
How's the deal supposed to work again?

1118
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:25,117
Elise said give some guy
a key to a bus locker.

1119
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:26,819
You got the key?

1120
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:31,289
Man, she didn't give me a key.

1121
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:35,971
See, that's what I'm talking about, man.
Me and Elise. We just don't mix.

1122
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:37,605
You see what I'm saying?

1123
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,071
Gotta break it off with her, man.

1124
01:09:40,142 --> 01:09:43,077
Just got to break it off. It's not gonna work.

1125
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:46,876
How are we supposed to do a key deal
if we don't have a key?

1126
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:03,330
I remember this one time
I lost my sunglasses?

1127
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:07,725
Honest to God, I looked for them
for an hour and 45 minutes.

1128
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:11,097
On my head the entire time.

1129
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:14,201
Hey, look, man. Our guy is ten o'clock.

1130
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:20,439
No, dude. That's nine. Your three o'clock.
Three o'clock.

1131
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:27,177
No. Look, you remember the guy
with the tattoos? The tattoos?

1132
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:30,918
- Oh, tattoo.
- Yeah.

1133
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:37,155
Yo.

1134
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:44,269
Who the fuck are you?

1135
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:48,706
Where the fuck is Mikey?

1136
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:51,345
- Mikey?
- Where's Mikey?

1137
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:55,878
Mikey couldn't make it today. But...

1138
01:10:56,785 --> 01:10:58,776
he sends his condolences.

1139
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:01,721
Condolences?

1140
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:04,584
Yeah.

1141
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:10,427
Listen, smart-ass. I don't like it.
I don't like it.

1142
01:11:10,866 --> 01:11:13,391
I don't like it one bit. Deal's off.

1143
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:17,035
- Just like that?
- Yeah. You got a problem with that?

1144
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:20,041
- Sorry I'm late, Earl.
- Mikey. What the fuck?

1145
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:23,940
Yo, what are you guys doing here?

1146
01:11:24,013 --> 01:11:26,641
That's what I want to know, Mikey.
Who the fuck are these chumps?

1147
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:28,444
- They're just...
- Are they cops, Mikey? Are they?

1148
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:29,575
No.

1149
01:11:29,652 --> 01:11:31,643
Because if they are,
you know what I gotta do, don't you?

1150
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,517
- They're not.
- You lying to me, Mikey?

1151
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:35,750
- Man, there's no way.
- Did you rat me, Mikey?

1152
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:37,314
- Did you rat me out?
- I never ratted nobody.

1153
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:39,623
That's not what I heard.
I heard you ratted out Manny...

1154
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:41,925
but I chose not to believe it.

1155
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:47,298
But I'm starting to have my doubts, okay?

1156
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:49,330
Okay?

1157
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:52,602
Hey, man, whoa.

1158
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:56,569
Okay. Let's go. Move. Move. Move.

1159
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:00,448
- I liked you, Mikey. I really did.
- But I...

1160
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:02,245
- But I didn't, I didn't do...
- Shut up.

1161
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:05,344
I liked you, Mikey,
but now you've gone and betrayed me.

1162
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:06,945
Now you're gonna have to pay.

1163
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:09,081
Actually, Earl, you know,
we have a previous engagement...

1164
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:12,719
I swear. One more word out of you,
I'm gonna blow your fucking head off.

1165
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:14,023
Get in.

1166
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:16,359
Open the door. Get in the van.

1167
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:18,122
Get in the van.

1168
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:58,772
Turn around.

1169
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:01,003
I said turn around!

1170
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:05,142
You're... You're not wearing a wire,
are you, Mikey?

1171
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:08,245
- Take off your shirt. Take off your shirt!
- Okay.

1172
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:10,979
- What are you doing, Earl?
- Excuse me, Earl?

1173
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,783
Just shut your pie-hole, Wyclef.

1174
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:17,184
How could you do this to me, Mikey?

1175
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:21,252
- Do what? What do you mean?
- Shut the fuck up or I swear I will...

1176
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:33,733
You know what I'm gonna have to do
to you now, don't you?

1177
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,109
Yo.

1178
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:49,289
No. Not yet.

1179
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:54,358
- I know. Where the hell they at?
- They'll be there.

1180
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:56,954
Just hang on.

1181
01:13:57,132 --> 01:13:58,724
I'll give it five more minutes.

1182
01:14:01,236 --> 01:14:02,362
Teach you a lesson, boy.

1183
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:05,464
Hurts me more than it hurts you.

1184
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:18,742
Wow.

1185
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:21,422
Yo, let's bounce.

1186
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:31,833
Sorry about that, Mikey.

1187
01:14:41,743 --> 01:14:44,211
It's going to be really awkward
seeing Mikey at the coffee shop.

1188
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:45,610
Yeah, man.

1189
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:47,280
What a dick.

1190
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:50,476
There's our man. Let's go.

1191
01:15:00,362 --> 01:15:01,659
What's up?

1192
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,496
What's up?

1193
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:07,564
- You got something for me or what?
- Maybe.

1194
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:09,794
You got something for me?

1195
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:12,466
Maybe.

1196
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:16,842
Gentlemen, this does not need to be
this complicated.

1197
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:18,875
Sir, here's your key.

1198
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:20,740
Cool.

1199
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:24,077
So, you guys working for Big Daddy now?

1200
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:27,121
- Temporarily.
- About to start our own business.

1201
01:15:27,222 --> 01:15:30,214
No doubt, no doubt.
I like that. What kind of business?

1202
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:32,121
Tiny classified ads.

1203
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:34,128
Oh, really? Ads for what?

1204
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:35,993
- It's complex.
- Right.

1205
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:39,226
I see.

1206
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:41,867
You know...

1207
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:45,239
I'm kind of doing
some complex shit too, man.

1208
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:48,799
I'm about to get this rap shit jumped off.
You feel me?

1209
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:50,401
It costs a lot of money though, man.

1210
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:53,073
You got studio time.
You gotta pay producers for tracks.

1211
01:15:53,148 --> 01:15:56,174
You gotta press up your CDs.
You gotta get your street team together.

1212
01:15:56,251 --> 01:15:58,185
I gotta get shot a couple of times.

1213
01:15:58,253 --> 01:16:01,347
You know, that shit's kind of tough.
I don't know if I want it in the arm or the leg.

1214
01:16:01,423 --> 01:16:03,118
I heard it reads better if it's in the stomach...

1215
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:05,159
but there are some complications
with that shit.

1216
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:06,990
You know? And...

1217
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:12,132
rappers like rottweilers, so I'm in therapy
working on my phobia of dogs.

1218
01:16:13,435 --> 01:16:16,029
Dogs are good. Dogs are good.

1219
01:16:18,473 --> 01:16:22,273
And, as you know,
there are hoes and weed.

1220
01:16:22,945 --> 01:16:25,072
- Weed.
- You see what I'm saying?

1221
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:26,671
My shit's complex too.

1222
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:28,875
So, are you really a rapper?

1223
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:30,815
Hells, yeah.

1224
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,786
I spit that lethal shit, son.

01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:44,184
<i>The very big guy with big tattoos.</i>

1247
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:47,525
<i>You better not fuck this up.</i>

1248
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:51,087
Hey!

1249
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:54,060
Hey!

1250
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:02,599
Mother...

1251
01:18:12,988 --> 01:18:16,583
- Hey, motherfucker!
- Pop the clutch! Pop the clutch!

1252
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:19,522
Shit, shit, shit.

1253
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,172
Shit!

1254
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:41,907
It's okay, baby.

1255
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:44,645
- I can't believe this shit, man.
- Is he coming? Is he coming?

1256
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,051
No, not yet.

1257
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:50,683
Cool Crush Killer!

1258
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:52,249
He's a wack rapper, man.

1259
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:54,352
- Chasin' me in his Impala!
- He's wack, man.

1260
01:18:54,429 --> 01:18:56,659
I don't even know why
you're feeling that stupid shit, man.

1261
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:59,292
- I thought he was pretty good.
- He wasn't good, man.

1262
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:01,562
Man, he's gonna kick our ass.

1263
01:19:02,971 --> 01:19:06,805
- Can't you go any faster, man?
- I can't. I'm stuck in second gear!

1264
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:09,940
- Oh, man. Oh, shit.
- Oh, man!

1265
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:11,706
Get out of here!

1266
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:14,575
- Pull over!
- Get out of here, man!

1267
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:16,173
- Pull over!
- I liked your rap!

1268
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:18,344
- Man, get out of here! He's wack!
- Pull over!

1269
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,615
- Pull over!
- I can't hear you.

1270
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:22,585
My window's broken!

1271
01:19:22,657 --> 01:19:24,181
Go! Go!

1272
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:25,556
- I'm going!
- Stop!

1273
01:19:25,627 --> 01:19:27,822
- Go! Do something!
- I'm going.

1274
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:37,870
- Start the car. Start the car!
- What are you doing?

1275
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:41,865
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1276
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:55,286
- Larry.
- Man, I took out the whole family!

1277
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:56,914
Come on, man!
That was some <i>Smokey and the Bandit,</i>

1278
01:19:56,992 --> 01:19:58,118
Burt Reynolds shit right there, man.

1279
01:19:58,193 --> 01:20:01,094
That was like Jeff Gordon
driving through <i>Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.</i>

1280
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,959
- Keep going, all right?
- Let's go to Big Daddy's house.

1281
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:08,263
Big Daddy's house. He'll know what to do.

1282
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:09,928
- Big Daddy's house is safe.
- Yeah, it's safe.

1283
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:14,066
- You know Big Daddy got a gun.
- He's got a big, big, Big-Daddy gun.

1284
01:20:14,843 --> 01:20:16,572
What do you mean by that?

1285
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,469
Oh, shit!

1286
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:22,272
Look out! God damn!

1287
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,281
Where's he at?

1288
01:20:24,352 --> 01:20:25,910
Oh, shit. Keep going. Just keep going.

1289
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:27,579
Come on, baby. Come on.

1290
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:29,715
All right, baby, all right.

1291
01:20:29,858 --> 01:20:32,088
- Oh, he mad now, man.
- Fuck!

1292
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:36,458
Right here. Right here. Turn right here.

1293
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:38,658
Shit.

1294
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:43,199
Man, we're going to die, man!

1295
01:20:43,271 --> 01:20:45,068
Just stay in the car. Stay in the car.

1296
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:49,076
Big Daddy! Big Daddy!

1297
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:51,269
Hey.

1298
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:53,974
Let's stay in the car. Let's stay in the car.

1299
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:09,993
Dogs are good. Dogs are good.

1300
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:13,732
Oh, shit.

1301
01:21:13,935 --> 01:21:17,462
Big Daddy!

1302
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:24,445
Get out. Grab the case. Grab the briefcase.

1303
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:29,045
- What's going on out here in my yard?
- Big Daddy, get this dog off of me, man!

1304
01:21:29,117 --> 01:21:31,108
Don't do it! Your man is crazy.

1305
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:33,518
He's been chasing us, Big Daddy.

1306
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:35,914
Percy? What are you doing, man?

1307
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:38,824
Your boys tried to fuck me, man.
It ain't right!

1308
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:40,828
They tried to fuck you? What?

1309
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:43,524
- Get this dog off me!
- Yeah, in a minute.

1310
01:21:43,598 --> 01:21:45,793
What does he mean, you tried to fuck him?

1311
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:47,095
I didn't know you guys were gay.

1312
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:48,601
- No.
- No.

1313
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:51,935
It was empty.
God, get this dog, man!

1314
01:21:52,007 --> 01:21:53,406
Locker? What are you talking about?

1315
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:55,272
They robbed me, man.

1316
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:58,546
- Did you rob the man?
- No.

1317
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:02,014
- Come on, man. Get your dog, man!
- Yeah, in a minute.

1318
01:22:05,186 --> 01:22:07,916
- Monopoly money, Percy?
- It's not what you think, man!

1319
01:22:07,989 --> 01:22:11,049
- I can explain.
- Well, I guess you better get started, then.

1320
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:14,061
I can explain. Look, look, it's...

1321
01:22:14,396 --> 01:22:17,388
It's... It was Elise, man. She put me on it.

1322
01:22:18,633 --> 01:22:20,658
- He's a liar.
- Really, man.

1323
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:24,999
She told me about some
stupid investment plan in Nicaragua...

1324
01:22:25,073 --> 01:22:28,509
and that she found another buyer
and she was gonna give me 20%.

1325
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:32,068
Man, I'm just trying to get this rap thing
off the ground, man. I ain't no criminal.

1326
01:22:32,147 --> 01:22:34,081
You are a fucking liar.

1327
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:36,580
You don't believe him, do you, sweetie?

1328
01:22:36,651 --> 01:22:38,551
Would I lie, Big Daddy?

1329
01:22:40,689 --> 01:22:41,678
No!

1330
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:43,989
Oh, Big Daddy!

1331
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:45,526
Heel, Killer!

1332
01:22:47,862 --> 01:22:49,022
Elise?

1333
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,092
Okay.

1334
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:55,733
Nicaragua was a stupid deal.

1335
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:57,431
I was just trying to protect you.

1336
01:22:57,505 --> 01:23:00,633
I didn't want you or us to lose everything.

1337
01:23:00,842 --> 01:23:03,743
I don't wanna go back to the trailer park
in Texas.

1338
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,677
I want to be with you.

1339
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:10,247
You understand me.
You're the first person that I've ever trusted.

1340
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:13,319
You're the only one
I've ever unconditionally loved.

1341
01:23:13,388 --> 01:23:14,980
Oh, Big Daddy...

1342
01:23:16,057 --> 01:23:17,649
you complete me.

1343
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:20,684
Nicaragua was a stupid deal?

1344
01:23:22,764 --> 01:23:24,425
Oh, hell, no. You got to go.

1345
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:26,433
Oh, please, Big Daddy.

1346
01:23:26,568 --> 01:23:27,762
Killer.

1347
01:23:30,138 --> 01:23:32,663
Okay, fine. Let me go get my things.

1348
01:23:32,974 --> 01:23:35,135
Your things, Elise? Come on.

1349
01:23:36,077 --> 01:23:37,772
Fine. I'll go.

1350
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:39,237
Fine.

1351
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:43,044
Big Daddy, please.

1352
01:23:46,955 --> 01:23:49,583
Wait up, you big dummy. I need a ride.

1353
01:23:58,099 --> 01:24:01,899
Guess you guys just knew it, huh?
You just somehow sensed it?

1354
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:18,142
Yeah, you know.

1355
01:24:18,686 --> 01:24:21,314
Matter of fact, you know,
I never trusted Elise in the first place.

1356
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:25,052
She been playing you the whole time,
just like she was stringing me along.

1357
01:24:25,126 --> 01:24:27,356
Here's your Susquehannas back.

1358
01:24:29,264 --> 01:24:31,164
Although I got to tell you, Big Daddy...

1359
01:24:31,232 --> 01:24:33,359
in my experience with Susquehannas...

1360
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:37,997
a set like yours would invariably be worth
exponentially more than $50,000 US.

1361
01:24:38,473 --> 01:24:39,963
You guys are good, man.

1362
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:43,135
You guys are very good! No wonder
you're going into business for yourselves.

1363
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:46,044
You have the ability to think on your feet,
improvise, and I like that.

1364
01:24:46,114 --> 01:24:47,979
You know,
I could use a couple of guys like you...

1365
01:24:48,049 --> 01:24:50,074
with your street smarts
and intuitive business sense.

1366
01:24:50,151 --> 01:24:51,641
I'm listening.

1367
01:24:52,187 --> 01:24:56,419
Well, I've got some international
real-estate investments I've been cultivating.

1368
01:24:56,491 --> 01:24:58,789
And you'll never guess where.

1369
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:00,617
- Nicaragua?
- No.

1370
01:25:00,695 --> 01:25:03,596
Actually, yeah, man. Yeah.
How did you know?

1371
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:05,826
I heard it's popping off down there.

1372
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:07,458
Listen, I'm headed down there in a few days.

1373
01:25:07,535 --> 01:25:10,197
What do you fellas think about coming
down there and working for me?

1374
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:11,568
- I'm down.
- I would love to.

1375
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:13,732
- Then it's a deal.
- Yes.

1376
01:25:13,808 --> 01:25:16,470
All right. You fellas come check me out
tomorrow. We'll work out the details.

1377
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:18,671
All right. Oh, Big Daddy.

1378
01:25:18,746 --> 01:25:20,611
Sorry, one last thing.

1379
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:23,113
Do you by any chance have cable?

1380
01:25:23,184 --> 01:25:27,052
Yeah, man, look, we've been trying
to watch the <i>Shawshank</i> marathon...

1381
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:29,113
all weekend long...

1382
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:31,249
and we were thinking, just maybe...

1383
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:33,590
just maybe we could catch the last one.

1384
01:25:33,661 --> 01:25:35,026
<i>The Shank?</i>

1385
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:38,424
Fellas, I got the special-edition
DVD director's cut.

1386
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,968
I was just about to watch it again.
Are you kidding me?

1387
01:25:41,035 --> 01:25:42,468
Come on, fellas.

1388
01:25:42,537 --> 01:25:43,868
Yes.

1389
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:45,401
Hey, Big Daddy, do me a favor, huh?

1390
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:46,462
Could you please tell Rico...

1391
01:25:46,574 --> 01:25:48,906
that Andy Dufresne
does not get ass-raped in <i>The Shank?</i>

1392
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:49,966
What are you talking about?

1393
01:25:50,044 --> 01:25:52,774
Of course he gets ass-raped.
It's a major plot point.

1394
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:55,280
I told you.

1395
01:26:30,652 --> 01:26:33,780
- It's Dick Dupree.
- Mr. Dupree! Mr. Dupree!

1396
01:26:34,622 --> 01:26:38,058
Fellas, fellas, I had no idea it was a scam.

1397
01:26:38,126 --> 01:26:39,991
I actually had nothing to do
with the whole thing.

1398
01:26:40,061 --> 01:26:42,461
Scam? What are you talking about?

1399
01:26:46,901 --> 01:26:48,493
We love you, man.

1400
01:26:48,736 --> 01:26:51,068
You're my hero. I just wanted to say hello.

1401
01:26:51,139 --> 01:26:54,006
Matter of fact, we're starting
our own "tiny classified ads" business.

1402
01:26:54,075 --> 01:26:55,099
Yeah, yeah!

1403
01:26:55,176 --> 01:26:56,336
Well, boys, let me...

1404
01:26:56,411 --> 01:26:58,003
Check that out. That's Dick Dupree.

1405
01:26:58,079 --> 01:26:59,979
Let me go ahead
and let you in on a little secret.

1406
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:03,506
Tiny classified ads, they're dead.
Those days are over.

1407
01:27:04,452 --> 01:27:06,249
All the big money...

1408
01:27:07,488 --> 01:27:09,718
All the big money is now in...

1409
01:27:11,593 --> 01:27:12,924
Nicaragua.

1410
01:27:14,829 --> 01:27:17,354
- That's where we're heading!
- Really?

1411
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:19,791
You gotta meet this guy. He's a genius.

1412
01:27:19,867 --> 01:27:22,392
Dick Dupree. I'm a big fan, man.

1413
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:25,598
I was at your seminar last week.
We're on our way to Nicaragua.

1414
01:27:28,543 --> 01:27:29,635
Yeah!

1415
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:42,014
I really, really... I need the rent money.

1416
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:45,958
- Lance, I thought we had until the 5th.
- You do.

1417
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,957
But it's already the 15th...

1418
01:27:49,497 --> 01:27:51,965
and you're three months behind already.

1419
01:27:53,968 --> 01:27:56,937
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes. I'm sure.

1420
01:27:57,005 --> 01:27:58,495
Dude, here it is again.

1421
01:27:58,573 --> 01:28:01,303
<i>... a mass-marketed infomercial, but first...</i>

1422
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:04,243
<i>one quick question. Just a quick question.</i>

1423
01:28:06,547 --> 01:28:09,539
<i>What is the number-one industry</i>
<i>on the planet?</i>

1424
01:28:09,651 --> 01:28:11,414
<i>Numero uno.</i>

1425
01:28:13,554 --> 01:28:14,953
<i>Real estate.</i>

1426
01:28:15,823 --> 01:28:20,317
<i>Real estate is the number-one industry</i>
<i>on the planet, year in, year out.</i>

1427
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:25,823
<i>Don't worry, I'm not here</i>
<i>hawking foreclosures...</i>

1428
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:28,300
<i>or some "get rich quick</i>
<i>without putting any money down" scheme.</i>

1429
01:28:28,369 --> 01:28:32,806
<i>I'm talking about</i>
<i>prime beachfront real estate...</i>

1430
01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:36,503
<i>in exotic, let it come...</i>

1431
01:28:38,713 --> 01:28:39,702
<i>Nicaragua.</i>

1432
01:28:40,114 --> 01:28:43,277
<i>Poised to become</i>
<i>the next Rio of the Third World.</i>

1433
01:28:46,254 --> 01:28:49,690
<i>Just listen to a testimonial from some</i>
<i>of my very dear, dear friends...</i>

1434
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:53,056
<i>who took advantage</i>
<i>of this awesome, awesome...</i>

1435
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:56,156
<i>opportunity.</i>

1436
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:58,790
Jon, I just can't believe it.

1437
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:02,533
It is so beautiful.

1438
01:29:03,304 --> 01:29:06,102
And so are you, baby. And so are you.

1439
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:07,835
- Listen, Jon.
- What?

1440
01:29:07,909 --> 01:29:09,604
I know that you've been frustrated with me...

1441
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:11,838
because you think
that I've been withholding sex from you.

1442
01:29:11,913 --> 01:29:14,575
No, baby, I don't care about that. I love you.

1443
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:17,675
Jon, I love you too, but I think there's
something you should know about me.

1444
01:29:17,752 --> 01:29:19,549
Holy shit.

1445
01:29:19,954 --> 01:29:21,216
<i>I'm Larry.</i>

1446
01:29:21,289 --> 01:29:23,223
Is that your baby brother?

1447
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:25,122
<i>And I'm Rico.</i>

1448
01:29:25,727 --> 01:29:29,595
<i>There was a time in our lives</i>
<i>when nothing was going right.</i>

1449
01:29:29,731 --> 01:29:31,494
<i>Down on our luck...</i>

1450
01:29:31,566 --> 01:29:34,296
<i>we were kicked out</i>
<i>of a one-room apartment.</i>

1451
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:36,769
<i>I was mistakenly courting a transvestite.</i>

1452
01:29:36,838 --> 01:29:38,032
<i>We were even kicked out of rehab.</i>

1453
01:29:38,106 --> 01:29:39,630
I'll be damned.

1454
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:43,677
Okay, I'm sorry.
What did you want to tell me?

1455
01:29:43,745 --> 01:29:47,476
<i>... every single one of you</i>
<i>is rich beyond your wildest dreams.</i>

1456
01:29:47,915 --> 01:29:50,475
<i>The banana peeler</i>
<i>The gold wheeler</i>

1457
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:54,351
<i>Chop you up like meat</i>
<i>put you on a tortilla</i>

1458
01:29:55,156 --> 01:29:57,181
Can you please shut it up?

1459
01:29:58,593 --> 01:30:00,754
<i>We were even kicked out of rehab.</i>

1460
01:30:01,162 --> 01:30:02,993
<i>It was hopeless.</i>

1461
01:30:03,364 --> 01:30:06,925
<i>Hell, the skin off my entire ball sack</i>
<i>fell off one time.</i>

1462
01:30:07,935 --> 01:30:09,698
<i>He's right. I was there.</i>

1463
01:30:09,771 --> 01:30:12,365
I can't believe that bullshit worked.

1464
01:30:12,874 --> 01:30:14,671
<i>... and then we met Dick.</i>

1465
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:17,006
<i>And he introduced us to...</i>

1466
01:30:17,145 --> 01:30:18,669
<i>Nicaragua.</i>

1467
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:23,149
Nicaragua.

1468
01:30:23,317 --> 01:30:24,579
Boy.
