1
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:08,310
People always ask me
if I know Tyler Durden.

2
00:02:09,145 --> 00:02:10,186
Three minutes.

3
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:12,584
This is it. Ground zero.

4
00:02:12,585 --> 00:02:16,338
Do you have a speech for the occasion?

5
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:19,988
With a gun barrel between your teeth,
you speak only in vowels.

6
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:22,073
I can't think of anything.

7
00:02:22,074 --> 00:02:26,140
For a second, I forget about
Tyler's controlled demolition thing

8
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:28,329
and l wonder how clean that gun is.

9
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,519
It's getting exciting now.

10
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,856
That old thing,
how you always hurt the one you love.

11
00:02:33,857 --> 00:02:36,045
Well, it works both ways.

12
00:02:36,046 --> 00:02:40,320
We have front-row seats
for this theater of mass destruction.

13
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:43,240
The Demolitions Committee
of Project Mayhem

14
00:02:43,241 --> 00:02:46,786
wrapped the foundations
of 12 buildings with explosives.

15
00:02:47,412 --> 00:02:50,852
In two minutes,
primary charges will blow base charges

16
00:02:50,853 --> 00:02:54,293
and a few blocks will be reduced
to smoldering rubble.

17
00:02:54,294 --> 00:02:57,421
I know this because Tyler knows this.

18
00:02:57,422 --> 00:03:00,966
Two and a half.
Think of everything we've accomplished.

19
00:03:00,967 --> 00:03:06,284
Suddenly I realize that all of this,
the gun, the bombs, the revolution,

20
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:09,726
has got something to do
with a girl named Marla Singer.

21
00:03:12,228 --> 00:03:14,625
Bob. Bob had bitch tits.

22
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:18,901
This was a support group
for men with testicular cancer.

23
00:03:18,902 --> 00:03:22,237
The big moosie slobbering all over me,
that was Bob.

24
00:03:22,238 --> 00:03:24,531
We're still men.

25
00:03:24,532 --> 00:03:26,825
Yes, we're men.

26
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:29,015
Men is what we are.

27
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:32,664
Bob had had his testicles removed.
Then hormone therapy.

28
00:03:32,665 --> 00:03:36,418
He developed bitch tits because
his testosterone was too high

29
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:38,608
and his body upped the estrogen.

30
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:42,570
- That was where I fit...
- They'll have to drain my pecs again.

31
00:03:42,571 --> 00:03:44,968
..between those huge sweating tits

32
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:49,452
that hung enormous,
the way you'd think of God's as big.

33
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:51,642
OK, you cry now.

34
00:03:51,643 --> 00:03:54,354
No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.

35
00:03:55,396 --> 00:03:58,315
For six months, I couldn't sleep.

36
00:03:58,316 --> 00:04:00,922
I couldn't sleep.

37
00:04:00,923 --> 00:04:03,216
With insomnia, nothing's real.

38
00:04:03,217 --> 00:04:05,302
Everything's faraway.

39
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,638
Everything's a copy of a copy

40
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,724
of a copy.

41
00:04:13,018 --> 00:04:18,648
When deep space exploration ramps up,
it'll be the corporations that name everything.

42
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:20,838
The IBM Stellar Sphere.

43
00:04:21,047 --> 00:04:23,236
The Microsoft Galaxy.

44
00:04:23,237 --> 00:04:25,426
The Planet Starbucks.

45
00:04:25,843 --> 00:04:28,970
I need you out of town this week
to cover some red flags.

46
00:04:28,971 --> 00:04:32,620
It must have been Tuesday.
He had on his cornflower blue tie.

47
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:37,312
You want me to deprioritize my reports
until you advise of a status upgrade?

48
00:04:37,313 --> 00:04:42,004
Prioritize these. Here's your flight coupons.
Call me if there's any snags.

49
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:46,072
He was full of pep.
Must have had his grande latte enema.

50
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:52,223
Like so many others, I had become
a slave to the Ikea nesting instinct.

51
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:54,725
Yes. I'd like to order

52
00:04:54,726 --> 00:04:57,019
the Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.

53
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,209
- Please hold.
- Anything clever,

54
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,798
like a coffee table in the shape of a yin-yang,
l had to have it.

55
00:05:04,632 --> 00:05:07,133
The Klipsk personal office unit.

56
00:05:07,134 --> 00:05:09,533
The Hovetrekke home exerbike.

57
00:05:09,741 --> 00:05:13,390
Or the Ohamshab sofa
with the Strinne green stripe pattern.

58
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:18,916
Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of
environmentally-friendly unbleached paper.

59
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:21,837
I'd flip through catalogs and wonder

60
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:24,964
"What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?"

61
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:29,864
I had it all. Even the glass dishes
with tiny bubbles and imperfections,

62
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:35,078
proof that they were crafted by the honest,
hard-working, indigenous peoples of...

63
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:38,103
- Please hold.
- ..Wherever.

64
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,709
We used to read pornography.

65
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,628
Now it was the Horchow collection.

66
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:47,069
- No. You can't die of insomnia.
- What about narcolepsy?

67
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,467
I nod off, I wake up in strange places.

68
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:51,658
I have no idea how I got there.

69
00:05:51,762 --> 00:05:55,619
- You need to lighten up.
- Can you please just give me something?

70
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,374
Red and blue Tuinals, lipstick-red Seconals...

71
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:03,232
No. You need healthy, natural sleep.

72
00:06:03,858 --> 00:06:07,507
Chew some valerian root
and get more exercise.

73
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,468
Hey, come on.

74
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:13,658
- I'm in pain.
- You wanna see pain?

75
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:16,265
Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.

76
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:19,393
See the guys with testicular cancer.

77
00:06:19,394 --> 00:06:21,584
That's pain.

78
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:40,977
I always wanted three kids...
two boys and a girl.

79
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:43,376
Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.

80
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,547
We never could agree on anything.

81
00:06:47,756 --> 00:06:49,631
Well, I... She...

82
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:52,238
She had her first child last week.

83
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:54,532
A girl.

84
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:57,974
With... With her... With her new husband.

85
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,789
Fuck!

86
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,229
Thank God, you know...

87
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,316
I'm glad for her.

88
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,174
She deserves...

89
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:17,785
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.

90
00:07:17,786 --> 00:07:19,871
Thank you, Thomas.

91
00:07:19,975 --> 00:07:23,519
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of courage.

92
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,605
And that gives me strength.

93
00:07:25,606 --> 00:07:28,107
We give each other strength.

94
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:30,507
It's time for the one-on-ones.

95
00:07:31,028 --> 00:07:35,511
So let's all of us follow Thomas's example
and really open ourselves up.

96
00:07:35,512 --> 00:07:37,597
Could you find a partner?

97
00:07:39,682 --> 00:07:43,019
And this is how I met the big moosie.

98
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,816
His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.

99
00:07:50,214 --> 00:07:53,133
Knees together. Those awkward little steps.

100
00:07:58,243 --> 00:08:00,432
- My name is Bob.
- Bob?

101
00:08:00,954 --> 00:08:03,352
Bob had been a champion body builder.

102
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:07,209
You know that chest expansion program
on late-night TV?

103
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,294
That was his idea.

104
00:08:09,295 --> 00:08:11,484
I was a juicer.

105
00:08:11,485 --> 00:08:13,674
You know, using steroids?

106
00:08:13,675 --> 00:08:16,280
Diabonal and

107
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:18,679
Wisterol.

108
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,746
Oh, they use that on racehorses,
for Christ sakes.

109
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:25,249
And now I'm bankrupt.

110
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,273
I'm divorced.

111
00:08:28,898 --> 00:08:31,088
My two grown kids

112
00:08:31,922 --> 00:08:34,632
won't even return my phone calls.

113
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:39,951
Strangers with this kind of honesty
make me go a big, rubbery one.

114
00:08:41,515 --> 00:08:43,704
Go ahead, ... Cornelius.

115
00:08:43,705 --> 00:08:45,790
You can cry.

116
00:09:01,535 --> 00:09:05,079
And then... something happened.
I let go.

117
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,164
That's really good.

118
00:09:07,165 --> 00:09:09,354
Lost in oblivion.

119
00:09:09,355 --> 00:09:11,753
Dark and silent and complete.

120
00:09:14,673 --> 00:09:18,531
I found freedom.
Losing all hope was freedom.

121
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:23,015
It's OK.

122
00:09:25,204 --> 00:09:27,498
Babies don't sleep this well.

123
00:09:31,043 --> 00:09:33,754
I became addicted.

124
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,498
If I didn't say anything

125
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:52,210
people always assumed the worst.

126
00:09:55,964 --> 00:09:59,196
They cried harder... then I cried harder.

127
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:12,646
Now we're going to open the green door,
the heart chakra...

128
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:14,837
I wasn't really dying.

129
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:17,861
I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.

130
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:22,657
I was the warm little center
that the life of this world crowded around.

131
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:26,619
Imagine your pain
as a white ball of healing light.

132
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,789
It moves over your body, healing you.

133
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,439
Now keep this going. Remember to breathe

134
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,194
and step forward
through the back door of the room.

135
00:10:38,924 --> 00:10:41,112
Where does it lead?

136
00:10:41,113 --> 00:10:43,302
To your cave.

137
00:10:43,303 --> 00:10:45,283
Step forward

138
00:10:45,284 --> 00:10:47,577
into your cave.

139
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:49,662
That's right.

140
00:10:49,663 --> 00:10:53,313
You're going deeper into your cave.

141
00:10:53,939 --> 00:10:56,127
And you're going to find

142
00:10:56,128 --> 00:10:58,318
your power animal.

143
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:01,655
Slide.

144
00:11:12,707 --> 00:11:14,897
Every evening I died.

145
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,755
And every evening I was born again.

146
00:11:19,172 --> 00:11:21,362
Resurrected.

147
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:27,721
Bob loved me because he thought
my testicles were removed too.

148
00:11:27,722 --> 00:11:30,537
Being there, pressed against his tits,

149
00:11:30,538 --> 00:11:32,726
ready to cry.

150
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:35,543
This was my vacation.

151
00:11:37,732 --> 00:11:39,400
And she

152
00:11:39,401 --> 00:11:42,111
ruined everything.

153
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:44,301
This is cancer, right?

154
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:49,409
This chick, Marla Singer,

155
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:52,225
did not have testicular cancer.

156
00:11:52,226 --> 00:11:54,310
She was a liar.

157
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:56,500
She had no diseases at all.

158
00:11:56,501 --> 00:12:00,358
I had seen her at Free And Clear,
my blood parasites group, Thursdays.

159
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:03,904
Then at Hope,
my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.

160
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:09,535
And again, at Seize The Day,
my tuberculosis, Friday night.

161
00:12:10,473 --> 00:12:12,453
Marla,

162
00:12:12,454 --> 00:12:15,060
the big tourist.

163
00:12:15,061 --> 00:12:17,251
Her lie reflected my lie.

164
00:12:17,668 --> 00:12:19,857
And suddenly, I felt nothing.

165
00:12:19,858 --> 00:12:23,610
I couldn't cry. So once again,

166
00:12:23,611 --> 00:12:25,801
I couldn't sleep.

167
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:39,251
Next group, after guided meditation,

168
00:12:39,252 --> 00:12:42,796
after we open our heart chakras,
when it's time to hug,

169
00:12:42,797 --> 00:12:46,028
I'm gonna grab that bitch,
Marla Singer, and scream.

170
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:50,200
Marla, you liar!
You big tourist, I need this! Now, get out!

171
00:12:52,077 --> 00:12:54,579
I hadn't slept in four days.

172
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,455
We'll just let that dry...

173
00:12:56,457 --> 00:13:00,001
When you have insomnia,
you're never really asleep.

174
00:13:00,002 --> 00:13:02,608
And you're never really awake.

175
00:13:03,651 --> 00:13:06,257
To begin tonight's communion,

176
00:13:06,258 --> 00:13:09,073
Chloe would like to say a few words.

177
00:13:09,178 --> 00:13:12,201
Oh, yeah. Chloe.

178
00:13:13,036 --> 00:13:17,935
Chloe looked the way Meryl Streep's skeleton
would look if you made it walk around

179
00:13:17,936 --> 00:13:20,126
being extra nice to everybody.

180
00:13:20,543 --> 00:13:22,628
Well, I'm still here.

181
00:13:22,941 --> 00:13:25,131
But I don't know for how long.

182
00:13:25,965 --> 00:13:29,196
That's as much certainty
as anyone can give me.

183
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:31,178
But I've got some good news.

184
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:35,141
I no longer have any fear of death.

185
00:13:38,895 --> 00:13:42,753
But... I am in a pretty lonely place.

186
00:13:43,691 --> 00:13:45,881
No-one will have sex with me.

187
00:13:47,028 --> 00:13:51,616
I'm so close to the end,
and all l want is to get laid for the last time.

188
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:55,473
I have pornographic movies
in my apartment,

189
00:13:55,474 --> 00:13:59,332
- and lubricants and amyl nitrite.
- Thank you, Chloe.

190
00:13:59,853 --> 00:14:02,042
Everyone, let's thank Chloe.

191
00:14:02,043 --> 00:14:04,337
Thank you, Chloe.

192
00:14:07,048 --> 00:14:11,010
Now, let's ready ourselves
for guided meditation.

193
00:14:11,948 --> 00:14:15,494
You're standing at the entrance of your cave.

194
00:14:15,911 --> 00:14:19,455
You step inside your cave and you walk...

195
00:14:19,456 --> 00:14:22,688
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.

196
00:14:23,731 --> 00:14:25,711
Marla.

197
00:14:25,712 --> 00:14:30,299
The scratch on the roof of your mouth
that would heal if you could stop tonguing it.

198
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,490
But you can't.

199
00:14:33,324 --> 00:14:36,138
..deeper into your cave as you walk.

200
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:39,893
You feel a healing energy all around you.

201
00:14:42,395 --> 00:14:44,585
Now find your power animal.

202
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,486
Slide.

203
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:56,471
OK. Let's partner up.

204
00:14:56,472 --> 00:14:58,870
Pick someone special to you tonight.

205
00:15:05,022 --> 00:15:07,212
Hey.

206
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:09,610
- We need to talk.
- Sure.

207
00:15:14,302 --> 00:15:16,491
- I'm onto you.
- What?

208
00:15:16,492 --> 00:15:19,723
Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.

209
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:21,600
Sorry?

210
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:26,709
In the Tibetan-philosophy, Sylvia-Plath
sense of the word, l know we're all dying.

211
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:31,090
- But you're not dying the way Chloe is.
- So?

212
00:15:31,507 --> 00:15:33,696
So you're a tourist.

213
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:37,866
I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,
I saw you at tuberculosis.

214
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:40,473
I saw you at testicular cancer!

215
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:42,246
I saw you practicing this.

216
00:15:42,247 --> 00:15:44,748
- Practicing what?
- Telling me off.

217
00:15:44,749 --> 00:15:48,711
Is it going as well as you hoped, ... Rupert?

218
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:50,587
I'll expose you.

219
00:15:50,588 --> 00:15:52,778
Go ahead. I'll expose you.

220
00:15:53,404 --> 00:15:56,428
Come together. Let yourselves cry.

221
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:05,498
Oh, God. Why are you doing this?

222
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:08,313
It's cheaper than a movie
and there's free coffee.

223
00:16:08,314 --> 00:16:11,129
Look, this is important.
These are my groups.

224
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,319
I've been coming for over a year.

225
00:16:13,424 --> 00:16:16,655
- Why do you do it?
- I don't know.

226
00:16:16,656 --> 00:16:20,617
When people think you're dying,
they listen to you instead of...

227
00:16:20,618 --> 00:16:23,747
Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.

228
00:16:24,893 --> 00:16:27,083
Yeah. Yeah.

229
00:16:28,126 --> 00:16:31,045
Share yourself... completely.

230
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:33,964
Look, you don't want to get into this.

231
00:16:33,965 --> 00:16:36,050
- It becomes an addiction.
- Really?

232
00:16:36,155 --> 00:16:40,429
I'm not kidding. I can't cry
if another faker is present, and I need this.

233
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,619
You gotta find somewhere else to go.

234
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:46,373
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.
It's not my problem.

235
00:16:49,397 --> 00:16:51,586
No, wait a second. Hold on.

236
00:16:51,587 --> 00:16:53,671
We'll split up the week, OK?

237
00:16:53,672 --> 00:16:55,965
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.

238
00:16:55,966 --> 00:16:59,197
You take tuberculosis.
My smoking doesn't go over at all.

239
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,534
OK. Good. Fine.
Testicular cancer should be no contest.

240
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:06,601
Technically, I have more right to be there.
You still have your balls.

241
00:17:06,602 --> 00:17:09,104
- You're kidding.
- I dunno. Am I?

242
00:17:09,626 --> 00:17:11,085
No. No.

243
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,900
- What do you want?
- I'll take the parasites.

244
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:16,819
You can't have both.
Take the blood parasites.

245
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:21,199
- I want brain parasites.
- I'll take the blood but I want brain dementia.

246
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,014
- I want that.
- You can't have the whole brain.

247
00:17:24,015 --> 00:17:26,621
So far, you have four. I only have two.

248
00:17:26,622 --> 00:17:30,583
OK. Take both the parasites. They're yours.

249
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:32,982
Now we both have three...

250
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:38,404
Hey! You left half your clothes.

251
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:57,068
- What, are you selling those?
- Yes!

252
00:17:57,069 --> 00:17:59,153
I'm selling some clothes!

253
00:17:59,154 --> 00:18:01,343
So! We each have three. That's six.

254
00:18:01,344 --> 00:18:04,262
What about the seventh day?
I want bowel cancer.

255
00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:06,452
The girl had done her homework.

256
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,643
No. No. I want bowel cancer.

257
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:11,353
That's your favorite too?

258
00:18:11,354 --> 00:18:15,002
- Tried to slip it by me, eh?
- Look, we'll split it.

259
00:18:15,003 --> 00:18:17,193
Take the first and third Sunday.

260
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:21,468
Deal.

261
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:26,368
Looks like this is goodbye.

262
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:28,662
Let's not make a big thing out of it.

263
00:18:28,663 --> 00:18:31,165
How's this for not making a big thing?

264
00:18:34,606 --> 00:18:36,483
Hey, Marla!

265
00:18:36,692 --> 00:18:38,880
Marla!

266
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:41,592
Maybe we should exchange numbers.

267
00:18:41,697 --> 00:18:43,677
Should we?

268
00:18:43,678 --> 00:18:47,849
- We might wanna switch nights.
- OK.

269
00:18:52,853 --> 00:18:55,460
This is how I met Marla Singer.

270
00:18:57,024 --> 00:19:01,507
Marla's philosophy of life
was that she might die at any moment.

271
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,905
The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.

272
00:19:03,906 --> 00:19:07,972
It doesn't have your name!
Who are you? Cornelius? Rupert?

273
00:19:07,973 --> 00:19:12,039
Travis? Any of the stupid names
you give each night?

274
00:19:14,855 --> 00:19:17,043
You wake up at SeaTac.

275
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:20,067
SFO. LAX.

276
00:19:20,068 --> 00:19:22,570
You wake up at O'Hare.

277
00:19:22,571 --> 00:19:24,759
Dallas Fort Worth.

278
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,740
BWI.

279
00:19:26,741 --> 00:19:30,703
Pacific. Mountain. Central.
Lose an hour. Gain an hour.

280
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:34,665
The check-in for that flight
isn't for another two hours, sir.

281
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:38,002
This is your life,
and it's ending one minute at a time.

282
00:19:38,003 --> 00:19:41,131
You wake up at Air Harbor international.

283
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:46,343
If you wake up at a different time,
in a different place,

284
00:19:46,344 --> 00:19:49,055
could you wake up as a different person?

285
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,244
Everywhere I travel,

286
00:19:51,245 --> 00:19:53,642
tiny life.

287
00:19:53,643 --> 00:19:56,249
Single-serving sugar and cream.

288
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,126
Single pat of butter.

289
00:19:58,127 --> 00:20:01,045
The microwave cordon bleu hobby-kit.

290
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:03,027
Shampoo-conditioner combos.

291
00:20:03,028 --> 00:20:07,094
Sample-package mouthwash.
Tiny bars of soap.

292
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:10,951
The people I meet on each flight,

293
00:20:10,952 --> 00:20:13,141
they're single-serving friends.

294
00:20:13,142 --> 00:20:16,999
Between take off and landing,
we have our time together.

295
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,397
That's all we get.

296
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:21,379
Welcome!

297
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,634
On a long enough time line,
the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.

298
00:20:27,635 --> 00:20:31,492
I was a recall coordinator.
My job was to apply the formula.

299
00:20:31,493 --> 00:20:33,995
The infant went through the windshield.

300
00:20:33,996 --> 00:20:38,061
A new car built by my company
leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.

301
00:20:38,063 --> 00:20:40,252
The rear differential locks up.

302
00:20:41,191 --> 00:20:43,901
The teenager's braces
are stuck to the ashtray.

303
00:20:43,902 --> 00:20:46,403
Might make a good anti-smoking ad.

304
00:20:46,404 --> 00:20:49,948
The car crashes and burns
with everyone trapped inside.

305
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:52,242
Now, should we initiate a recall?

306
00:20:52,243 --> 00:20:54,432
The father must have been huge.

307
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:57,769
See where the fat burned to the seat?
The polyester shirt?

308
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,854
Very modern art.

309
00:20:59,855 --> 00:21:02,461
Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.

310
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:05,276
Multiply it by the probable rate of failure, B.

311
00:21:05,277 --> 00:21:09,030
Multiply the result by
the average out-of-court settlement, C.

312
00:21:09,031 --> 00:21:11,221
A x B x C

313
00:21:11,325 --> 00:21:13,306
equals X.

314
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,016
If X is less than the cost of a recall,

315
00:21:16,017 --> 00:21:18,102
we don't do one.

316
00:21:18,207 --> 00:21:21,438
Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?

317
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:23,420
You wouldn't believe.

318
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,486
Which car company do you work for?

319
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,676
A major one.

320
00:21:32,075 --> 00:21:36,036
Every time the plane banked too sharply
on takeoff or landing,

321
00:21:36,037 --> 00:21:39,478
I prayed for a crash or a midair collision.

322
00:21:40,104 --> 00:21:41,772
Anything.

323
00:21:50,426 --> 00:21:54,284
Life insurance pays off triple
if you die on a business trip.

324
00:21:57,204 --> 00:22:00,435
"If you are seated in an emergency exit row"

325
00:22:00,436 --> 00:22:04,189
and would be unable or unwilling
to perform the duties

326
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:08,778
"listed on the safety card, please
ask a flight attendant to re-seat you."

327
00:22:10,342 --> 00:22:12,426
It's a lot of responsibility.

328
00:22:12,427 --> 00:22:14,825
Wanna switch seats?

329
00:22:14,826 --> 00:22:18,370
No. I'm not sure
I'm the man for that particular job.

330
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:22,853
An exit-door procedure at 30,000 feet.

331
00:22:22,855 --> 00:22:24,940
The illusion of safety.

332
00:22:25,148 --> 00:22:27,233
Yeah. I guess so.

333
00:22:27,234 --> 00:22:30,257
You know why
they put oxygen masks on planes?

334
00:22:30,258 --> 00:22:35,054
- So you can breathe.
- Oxygen gets you high.

335
00:22:35,993 --> 00:22:39,537
In a catastrophic emergency,
you take giant panic breaths.

336
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:42,144
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.

337
00:22:42,145 --> 00:22:44,543
You accept your fate.

338
00:22:45,168 --> 00:22:47,253
It's all right here.

339
00:22:47,254 --> 00:22:50,485
Emergency water landing, 60omph.

340
00:22:50,486 --> 00:22:53,300
Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.

341
00:22:53,302 --> 00:22:55,491
That's...

342
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:59,036
That's an interesting theory.

343
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:03,102
- What do you do?
- What do you mean?

344
00:23:03,103 --> 00:23:05,293
What do you do for a living?

345
00:23:05,397 --> 00:23:08,734
Why? So you can pretend you're interested?

346
00:23:11,236 --> 00:23:12,696
OK.

347
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,824
You have
a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.

348
00:23:18,952 --> 00:23:21,038
We have the exact same briefcase.

349
00:23:21,872 --> 00:23:23,956
Soap.

350
00:23:23,957 --> 00:23:27,710
- Sorry?
- I make and I sell soap.

351
00:23:27,711 --> 00:23:30,109
The yardstick of civilization.

352
00:23:30,526 --> 00:23:32,611
And this is how I met...

353
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:34,488
Tyler Durden.

354
00:23:34,593 --> 00:23:39,909
Did you know if you mix gasoline and
frozen orange juice, you can make napalm?

355
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,933
- No, I did not. Is that true?
- That's right.

356
00:23:42,934 --> 00:23:47,000
One can make all kinds of explosives
with simple household items.

357
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:49,503
- Really?
- If one was so inclined.

358
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:59,513
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting
single-serving friend I have ever met.

359
00:24:01,286 --> 00:24:05,456
- Everything on a plane is single-serving...
- Oh, I get it. Very clever.

360
00:24:05,457 --> 00:24:07,124
Thank you.

361
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:09,314
How's it working out for you?

362
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:12,129
- What?
- Being clever?

363
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:14,632
Great.

364
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:17,656
Keep it up, then. Right up.

365
00:24:18,803 --> 00:24:20,993
A question of etiquette.

366
00:24:21,097 --> 00:24:24,226
As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?

367
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:33,400
How I came to live with Tyleris...

368
00:24:33,401 --> 00:24:37,885
Airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage.

369
00:24:45,497 --> 00:24:50,292
- Was it ticking?
- Throwers know modern bombs don't tick.

370
00:24:50,293 --> 00:24:53,420
- Sorry, throwers?
- Baggage handlers.

371
00:24:53,421 --> 00:24:55,715
But when a suitcase vibrates,

372
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,529
the throwers have got to call the police.

373
00:24:58,531 --> 00:25:02,179
- My suitcase was vibrating?
- Nine times out often

374
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,369
it's an electric razor.

375
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,559
But... every once in a while

376
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,564
it's a dildo.

377
00:25:12,294 --> 00:25:16,360
It's company policy never to imply
ownership in the event of a dildo.

378
00:25:16,361 --> 00:25:20,322
We have to use the indefinite article,
a dildo, never

379
00:25:20,323 --> 00:25:22,512
your dildo.

380
00:25:22,513 --> 00:25:24,598
I don't own...

381
00:25:27,205 --> 00:25:30,436
I had everything in that suitcase.
My CK shirts.

382
00:25:30,437 --> 00:25:33,774
My DKNYshoes. My AX ties.

383
00:25:35,338 --> 00:25:37,736
Never mind.

384
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:42,324
Hey! That's my car!

385
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,665
Home was a condo on the 15th floor

386
00:25:50,666 --> 00:25:53,793
of a filing cabinet
for widows and professionals.

387
00:25:53,794 --> 00:25:56,400
The walls were solid concrete.

388
00:25:56,401 --> 00:25:58,589
A foot of concrete is important

389
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:02,969
when your next-door neighbor
has to watch game shows at full volume.

390
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,931
Or when a blast of debris
that used to be your personal effects

391
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:11,103
blows out of your windows
and sails flaming into the night.

392
00:26:17,463 --> 00:26:19,862
I suppose these things happen.

393
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:34,771
There's... nothing up there.

394
00:26:34,772 --> 00:26:38,318
You can't go into the unit. Police orders.

395
00:26:46,868 --> 00:26:49,473
Do you have somebody you can call?

396
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,663
How embarrassing.

397
00:26:51,664 --> 00:26:54,688
A houseful of condiments and no food.

398
00:27:03,968 --> 00:27:07,930
The police later told me
the pilot light might have gone out

399
00:27:08,765 --> 00:27:11,787
letting out just a little bit of gas.

400
00:27:11,788 --> 00:27:14,186
That gas could have filled the condo.

401
00:27:14,187 --> 00:27:17,836
1700 square feet with high ceilings
for days and days.

402
00:27:25,865 --> 00:27:29,827
Then the refrigerator's compressor
could have clicked on.

403
00:27:30,766 --> 00:27:32,851
Yeah?

404
00:27:35,979 --> 00:27:38,065
I can hear you breathing...

405
00:27:46,615 --> 00:27:50,681
If you ask me now,
I couldn't tell you why I called him.

406
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:36,143
- Hello?
- Who's this?

407
00:28:38,229 --> 00:28:40,418
- Tyler?
- Who is this?

408
00:28:41,982 --> 00:28:44,275
We met... We met on the airplane.

409
00:28:44,276 --> 00:28:46,569
We had the same suitcase?

410
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,759
The clever guy?

411
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,158
Oh, yeah. Right.

412
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:55,849
I called a second ago. There was no answer.

413
00:28:55,850 --> 00:29:00,230
- I'm at a payphone.
- Yeah, I *69'd you. I never pick up my phone.

414
00:29:02,732 --> 00:29:04,922
So what's up?

415
00:29:05,548 --> 00:29:07,632
Well.

416
00:29:07,633 --> 00:29:09,823
You're not gonna believe this.

417
00:29:11,804 --> 00:29:14,097
You know, it could be worse.

418
00:29:14,098 --> 00:29:18,060
A woman could cut off your penis
while you sleep and toss it out of a car.

419
00:29:18,686 --> 00:29:22,126
There's always that. I don't know.

420
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:25,358
When you buy furniture,
you tell yourself, that's it.

421
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:27,548
That's the last sofa I'll need.

422
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:30,363
Whatever happens,
that sofa problem is handled.

423
00:29:30,364 --> 00:29:33,908
I had it all.
I had a stereo that was very decent.

424
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:37,558
A wardrobe that was getting very respectable.

425
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,747
I was close to being complete.

426
00:29:39,748 --> 00:29:42,458
- Shit, man. Now it's all gone.
- All gone.

427
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:45,275
All gone.

428
00:29:46,422 --> 00:29:48,506
Do you know what a duvet is?

429
00:29:48,507 --> 00:29:51,530
- A comforter.
- It's a blanket.

430
00:29:51,531 --> 00:29:55,596
Just a blanket. Why do guys
like you and I know what a duvet is?

431
00:29:55,598 --> 00:29:59,872
Is this essential to our survival
in the hunter-gatherer sense?

432
00:29:59,873 --> 00:30:01,540
No.

433
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:03,625
What are we, then?

434
00:30:03,626 --> 00:30:06,336
I dunno. Consumers.

435
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:08,526
Right. We're consumers.

436
00:30:08,527 --> 00:30:11,863
We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession.

437
00:30:11,864 --> 00:30:15,825
Murder, crime, poverty.
These things don't concern me.

438
00:30:15,826 --> 00:30:19,370
What concerns me are celebrity magazines,

439
00:30:19,371 --> 00:30:21,560
television with 500 channels,

440
00:30:21,561 --> 00:30:24,375
some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine.

441
00:30:24,376 --> 00:30:26,462
Viagra. Olestra.

442
00:30:26,566 --> 00:30:29,380
- Martha Stewart.
- Fuck Martha Stewart.

443
00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:32,926
She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.
It's all going down.

444
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:36,783
So fuck off with your sofa units
and Strinne green stripe patterns.

445
00:30:36,784 --> 00:30:40,224
I say never be complete.

446
00:30:40,225 --> 00:30:42,310
I say stop being perfect.

447
00:30:42,311 --> 00:30:44,395
I say let's evolve.

448
00:30:44,396 --> 00:30:46,794
Let the chips fall where they may.

449
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,069
But that's me, and I could be wrong.

450
00:30:51,174 --> 00:30:53,258
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.

451
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:55,865
It's just stuff. Not a tragedy...

452
00:30:55,866 --> 00:30:59,619
You did lose a lot of versatile solutions
for modern living.

453
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,331
Fuck, you're right. I don't smoke.

454
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:09,630
My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...

455
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:14,008
What?

456
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:17,346
The things you own end up owning you.

457
00:31:20,474 --> 00:31:22,663
Do what you like, man.

458
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:25,791
Oh, it's late.

459
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:28,606
- Hey, thanks for the beer.
- Yeah, man.

460
00:31:28,607 --> 00:31:30,797
I should find a hotel.

461
00:31:31,526 --> 00:31:33,611
What?

462
00:31:33,612 --> 00:31:35,280
What?

463
00:31:35,384 --> 00:31:37,470
- A hotel?
- Yeah.

464
00:31:37,574 --> 00:31:40,701
- Just ask, man.
- What are you talking about?

465
00:31:40,702 --> 00:31:44,560
Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer
and you still can't ask.

466
00:31:45,394 --> 00:31:47,167
What?

467
00:31:47,271 --> 00:31:49,877
You called me
because you needed a place to stay.

468
00:31:49,878 --> 00:31:53,422
- Oh, hey. No, no, no.
- Yes, you did. So just ask.

469
00:31:53,423 --> 00:31:56,134
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.

470
00:31:57,803 --> 00:32:00,096
Would... Would that be a problem?

471
00:32:00,097 --> 00:32:02,286
Is it a problem for you to ask?

472
00:32:03,225 --> 00:32:05,519
- Can I stay at your place?
- Yeah.

473
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,960
Thanks.

474
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:16,258
- I want you to do me a favor.
- Yeah, sure.

475
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:18,656
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

476
00:32:18,657 --> 00:32:20,741
What?

477
00:32:20,742 --> 00:32:24,599
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

478
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,624
Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.

479
00:32:27,728 --> 00:32:30,230
Tyler was a night person.

480
00:32:30,231 --> 00:32:32,524
While the rest of us slept, he worked.

481
00:32:32,525 --> 00:32:35,756
He had one part-time job as a projectionist.

482
00:32:35,757 --> 00:32:38,780
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.
Lt comes on a few.

483
00:32:38,781 --> 00:32:42,638
Someone has to switch the projectors
at the exact moment

484
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:45,870
that one reel ends and the next one begins.

485
00:32:45,871 --> 00:32:49,937
You can see little dots come into
the upper right corner of the screen.

486
00:32:49,938 --> 00:32:52,752
In the industry, we call them cigarette burns.

487
00:32:52,753 --> 00:32:54,942
That's the cue for a changeover.

488
00:32:54,943 --> 00:32:59,738
He flips the projectors, movie keeps
going and the audience has no idea.

489
00:32:59,739 --> 00:33:02,137
Why would anyone want this shit job?

490
00:33:02,138 --> 00:33:05,265
Because it affords him
interesting opportunities.

491
00:33:05,266 --> 00:33:09,018
Like splicing a frame of pornography
into family films.

492
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:14,128
So when the snooty cat and the courageous
dog with the celebrity voices first meet,

493
00:33:14,129 --> 00:33:18,508
that's when you'll catch a flash
of Tyler's contribution to the film.

494
00:33:25,181 --> 00:33:27,891
Nobody knows that they saw it but they did.

495
00:33:27,892 --> 00:33:30,499
Nice, big cock.

496
00:33:35,191 --> 00:33:38,111
Even a hummingbird
couldn't catch Tyler at work.

497
00:33:43,325 --> 00:33:48,538
Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet
waiter at the luxurious Pressman hotel.

498
00:33:53,022 --> 00:33:57,191
He was the guerrilla terrorist
of the food service industry.

499
00:33:57,193 --> 00:33:59,485
Do not watch. I cannot go when you watch.

500
00:33:59,486 --> 00:34:03,969
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,
he farted on meringues,

501
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:06,680
and as for the cream of mushroom soup...

502
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:08,766
Go ahead, tell 'em.

503
00:34:08,767 --> 00:34:10,852
You get the idea.

504
00:34:11,061 --> 00:34:14,292
- You just want me to hit you?
- Come on. Do me this one favor.

505
00:34:14,293 --> 00:34:17,837
- Why?
- I don't know. Never been in a fight. You?

506
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:21,799
- No. But that's a good thing.
- You can't know yourself if you haven't!

507
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,302
I don't wanna die without any scars.

508
00:34:24,303 --> 00:34:28,577
- Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.
- Oh, God. This is crazy.

509
00:34:28,578 --> 00:34:30,975
So go crazy! Let it rip.

510
00:34:30,976 --> 00:34:33,790
- I don't know about this.
- I don't either.

511
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:36,919
Who gives a shit? No-one's watching.
What do you care?

512
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,525
This is crazy. You want me to hit you?!

513
00:34:39,526 --> 00:34:41,611
That's right.

514
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:44,948
- Where? Like, in the face?
- Surprise me.

515
00:34:47,034 --> 00:34:49,224
This is so fucking stupid.

516
00:34:59,963 --> 00:35:02,257
Motherfucker!

517
00:35:02,362 --> 00:35:04,446
He hit me in the ear!

518
00:35:04,447 --> 00:35:07,678
- Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.
- Ow, Christ!

519
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:09,868
- Why the ear, man?
- I fucked it up.

520
00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:11,642
No, that was perfect.

521
00:35:24,467 --> 00:35:26,657
No, it's all right.

522
00:35:27,491 --> 00:35:29,576
It really hurts.

523
00:35:29,993 --> 00:35:32,183
Right.

524
00:35:32,392 --> 00:35:34,685
Hit me again.

525
00:35:34,686 --> 00:35:36,875
No, you hit me. Come on!

526
00:35:53,767 --> 00:35:56,374
We should do this again sometime.

527
00:36:09,095 --> 00:36:11,389
- Where's your car?
- What car?

528
00:36:21,816 --> 00:36:24,214
I don't know how Tyler found that house

529
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:26,611
but he said he'd been there for a year.

530
00:36:26,612 --> 00:36:29,635
It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.

531
00:36:29,636 --> 00:36:32,138
Most of the windows were boarded up.

532
00:36:32,139 --> 00:36:37,455
There was no lock on the front door from
when the police, or whoever, kicked it in.

533
00:36:37,456 --> 00:36:39,646
The stairs were ready to collapse.

534
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,356
I didn't know if he owned it or was squatting.

535
00:36:42,357 --> 00:36:44,964
Neither would have surprised me.

536
00:36:45,694 --> 00:36:47,778
Yep. That's you.

537
00:36:47,779 --> 00:36:50,489
That's me. That's the toilet. Good?

538
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,679
Yeah, thanks.

539
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,660
What a shithole.

540
00:36:54,661 --> 00:36:56,642
Nothing worked.

541
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:04,253
Turning on one light meant
another light in the house went out.

542
00:37:04,254 --> 00:37:08,111
There were no neighbors.
Just warehouses and a paper-mill.

543
00:37:08,112 --> 00:37:12,283
That fart-smell of steam.
The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.

544
00:37:13,951 --> 00:37:16,454
What have we here?

545
00:37:31,052 --> 00:37:33,241
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

546
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:47,318
Every time I trained, we had to kill the power.

547
00:37:48,152 --> 00:37:51,697
By the end of the first month,
I didn't miss TV.

548
00:37:52,636 --> 00:37:56,077
I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.

549
00:38:08,172 --> 00:38:10,466
Can I be next?

550
00:38:14,845 --> 00:38:16,931
All right, man.

551
00:38:17,035 --> 00:38:19,016
Lose the tie.

552
00:38:22,978 --> 00:38:27,566
At night, Tyler and I were alone
for half a mile in every direction.

553
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:36,845
Rain trickled down through
the plaster and the light fixtures.

554
00:38:36,846 --> 00:38:39,661
Everything wooden swelled and shrank.

555
00:38:39,662 --> 00:38:42,997
Everywhere were rusted nails
to snag your elbow on.

556
00:38:42,998 --> 00:38:45,708
The previous occupant had been a shut-in.

557
00:38:45,709 --> 00:38:47,898
Hey, man. What are you reading?

558
00:38:47,899 --> 00:38:52,277
Listen to this. It's an article written
by an organ in the first person.

559
00:38:52,278 --> 00:38:55,197
"I am Jack's medulla oblongata.
Without me,

560
00:38:55,198 --> 00:38:58,742
Jack could not regulate
his heart rate or breathing."

561
00:38:58,743 --> 00:39:00,932
There's a whole series of these.

562
00:39:00,933 --> 00:39:03,123
"I Am Jill's Nipples."

563
00:39:04,999 --> 00:39:09,170
- "I Am Jack's Colon."
- "I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack."

564
00:39:12,194 --> 00:39:16,156
After fighting, everything else
in life got the volume turned down.

565
00:39:18,033 --> 00:39:19,805
What?

566
00:39:19,806 --> 00:39:23,560
- You could deal with anything.
- Have you finished those reports?

567
00:39:28,043 --> 00:39:30,649
If you could choose,
who would you fight?

568
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,840
I'd fight my boss, probably.

569
00:39:32,944 --> 00:39:35,133
Really?

570
00:39:35,134 --> 00:39:38,469
- Yeah, why? Who would you fight?
- I'd fight my dad.

571
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,659
I don't know my dad.

572
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,641
I mean, I know him, but...

573
00:39:42,745 --> 00:39:45,143
He left when I was like, six years old.

574
00:39:45,144 --> 00:39:48,166
Married this other woman
and had some other kids.

575
00:39:48,167 --> 00:39:50,356
He did this every six years.

576
00:39:50,357 --> 00:39:54,632
- He changes city and starts a new family.
- Fucker's setting up franchises!

577
00:39:55,258 --> 00:39:57,446
My dad never went to college.

578
00:39:57,448 --> 00:40:01,513
- So it was real important that I go.
- That sounds familiar.

579
00:40:01,514 --> 00:40:06,101
So I graduate. Call him up long-distance
and say, "Dad, now what?"

580
00:40:06,102 --> 00:40:08,187
- He says, "Get a job."
- Same here.

581
00:40:08,188 --> 00:40:10,897
Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.

582
00:40:10,898 --> 00:40:12,983
"Dad, now what?"

583
00:40:12,984 --> 00:40:15,172
He says, "I dunno. Get married."

584
00:40:15,174 --> 00:40:18,823
You can't get married.

585
00:40:19,344 --> 00:40:21,534
I'm a 30-year-old boy.

586
00:40:21,638 --> 00:40:24,140
We're a generation of men raised by women.

587
00:40:24,141 --> 00:40:28,624
I'm wondering if another woman
is really the answer we need.

588
00:40:34,464 --> 00:40:37,800
Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.

589
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:42,180
But every Saturday night,
we were finding something out.

590
00:40:43,222 --> 00:40:46,872
We were finding out more and more
that we were not alone.

591
00:40:50,626 --> 00:40:55,317
It used to be that when I came home angry
or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.

592
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:57,506
Polish my Scandinavian furniture.

593
00:40:57,507 --> 00:41:02,616
I should have been looking for a new condo
or haggling with my insurance company.

594
00:41:02,617 --> 00:41:06,474
I should have been upset
about my nice flaming little shit.

595
00:41:06,475 --> 00:41:08,455
But I wasn't.

596
00:41:08,456 --> 00:41:12,208
The premise of cybernetting an office
is make things more efficient.

597
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:15,232
Monday mornings,
I just thought about next week.

598
00:41:15,233 --> 00:41:18,256
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?

599
00:41:18,257 --> 00:41:19,404
Absolutely.

600
00:41:19,508 --> 00:41:22,844
Efficiency is priority No.1, people.

601
00:41:22,845 --> 00:41:25,764
Because waste is a thief.

602
00:41:25,765 --> 00:41:28,997
I showed this to my man here.
You liked it, didn't you?

603
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:36,609
You can swallow a pint of blood
before you get sick.

604
00:41:37,547 --> 00:41:39,840
It was right in everyone's face.

605
00:41:39,841 --> 00:41:42,031
Tyler and I just made it visible.

606
00:41:42,135 --> 00:41:44,637
It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.

607
00:41:44,638 --> 00:41:46,827
Tyler and I just gave it a name.

608
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,070
Come on, you've gotta go home!

609
00:42:22,175 --> 00:42:24,678
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.

610
00:42:45,532 --> 00:42:49,284
Every week,
Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.

611
00:42:49,285 --> 00:42:51,371
Gentlemen!

612
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:54,290
Welcome to Fight Club.

613
00:42:56,272 --> 00:42:58,565
The first rule of Fight Club is

614
00:42:58,566 --> 00:43:00,963
you do not talk about Fight Club.

615
00:43:00,964 --> 00:43:03,675
The second rule of Fight Club is

616
00:43:03,988 --> 00:43:07,532
you do not talk about Fight Club!

617
00:43:07,533 --> 00:43:09,930
Third rule of Fight Club.

618
00:43:09,931 --> 00:43:12,746
Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,

619
00:43:12,851 --> 00:43:15,665
the fight is over. Fourth rule.

620
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:18,063
Only two guys to a fight.

621
00:43:18,064 --> 00:43:20,044
Fifth rule.

622
00:43:20,045 --> 00:43:22,755
One fight at a time, fellas.

623
00:43:22,756 --> 00:43:25,362
Sixth rule. No shirts. No shoes.

624
00:43:25,363 --> 00:43:29,430
Seventh rule.
Fights will go on as long as they have to.

625
00:43:31,098 --> 00:43:33,809
And the eighth and final rule.

626
00:43:34,852 --> 00:43:38,083
If this is your first night at Fight Club

627
00:43:38,084 --> 00:43:40,274
you have to fight.

628
00:43:44,236 --> 00:43:46,322
This kid from work, Ricky,

629
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:51,117
couldn't remember whether
you ordered pens with blue ink or black.

630
00:43:51,118 --> 00:43:53,515
But Ricky was a god for ten minutes

631
00:43:53,516 --> 00:43:57,061
when he trounced
the maitre d' of a local food court.

632
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:04,256
Sometimes, all you could hear were the flat,
hard, packing sounds over the yelling.

633
00:44:07,906 --> 00:44:10,928
Or the wet choke
when someone gasped and sprayed...

634
00:44:10,929 --> 00:44:13,015
Stop!

635
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,038
You weren't alive anywhere
like you were there.

636
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:21,044
But Fight Club only exists in the hours
between when Fight Club starts and ends.

637
00:44:21,356 --> 00:44:24,484
Even if I could tell someone
they had a good fight,

638
00:44:24,485 --> 00:44:26,882
I wouldn't be talking to the same man.

639
00:44:26,883 --> 00:44:30,323
Who you were in Fight Club
is not who you were outside of it.

640
00:44:30,324 --> 00:44:35,328
A guy came to Fight Club for the first time.
His ass was a wad of cookie dough.

641
00:44:35,329 --> 00:44:38,353
After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.

642
00:44:39,082 --> 00:44:42,418
If you could fight any celebrity,
who would you fight?

643
00:44:42,419 --> 00:44:45,651
- Alive or dead?
- Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?

644
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:49,718
Hemingway. You?

645
00:44:50,135 --> 00:44:53,472
Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.

646
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:57,851
We all started seeing things differently.

647
00:44:58,894 --> 00:45:02,439
Everywhere we went,
we were sizing things up.

648
00:45:05,567 --> 00:45:08,799
I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,

649
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,969
trying to look like how Calvin Klein
or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.

650
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:15,160
Is that what a man looks like?

651
00:45:15,994 --> 00:45:19,017
Oh, self-improvement is masturbation.

652
00:45:19,018 --> 00:45:21,102
Now, self-destruction...

653
00:45:21,103 --> 00:45:23,189
Excuse me.

654
00:45:57,807 --> 00:46:01,038
Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.

655
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:03,125
It wasn't about words.

656
00:46:05,106 --> 00:46:08,546
The hysterical shouting was in tongues

657
00:46:08,547 --> 00:46:10,632
like at a Pentecostal Church.

658
00:46:15,116 --> 00:46:17,304
- Is that it?
- Stop!

659
00:46:17,305 --> 00:46:20,224
When the fight was over, nothing was solved.

660
00:46:20,225 --> 00:46:22,206
But nothing mattered.

661
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:25,020
Cool.

662
00:46:25,021 --> 00:46:27,941
Afterwards, we all felt saved.

663
00:46:28,879 --> 00:46:31,173
Hey, man. How about next week?

664
00:46:31,278 --> 00:46:33,362
How about next month?!

665
00:46:33,363 --> 00:46:35,552
Irvine, you're in the middle.

666
00:46:35,553 --> 00:46:37,638
New guy, you too.

667
00:46:39,411 --> 00:46:41,599
Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.

668
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,790
He fell down some stairs.

669
00:46:44,416 --> 00:46:46,605
I fell down some stairs.

670
00:46:48,274 --> 00:46:53,069
Fight Club became the reason to cut
your hair short or trim your fingernails.

671
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:55,572
OK. Any historical figure.

672
00:46:55,573 --> 00:46:57,554
I'd fight Gandhi.

673
00:46:58,075 --> 00:47:00,055
Good answer.

674
00:47:00,056 --> 00:47:02,349
- How about you?
- Lincoln.

675
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:05,060
Lincoln?

676
00:47:05,061 --> 00:47:08,815
Big guy, big reach.
Skinny guys fight till they're burger.

677
00:47:09,545 --> 00:47:11,630
Fuck!

678
00:47:12,882 --> 00:47:15,593
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.

679
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,019
Hello?

680
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,521
Where have you been the last eight weeks?

681
00:47:28,522 --> 00:47:29,878
Marla?

682
00:47:32,902 --> 00:47:36,029
- How did you find me?
- You left a forwarding number.

683
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:39,157
I haven't seen you at any support groups.

684
00:47:39,158 --> 00:47:42,493
We split 'em up.
That was the idea. Remember?

685
00:47:42,494 --> 00:47:45,413
Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.

686
00:47:45,414 --> 00:47:48,958
- How do you know?
- I cheated.

687
00:47:48,959 --> 00:47:50,836
I found a new one.

688
00:47:51,357 --> 00:47:53,650
- Really?
- It's for men only.

689
00:47:53,651 --> 00:47:55,320
Like the testicle thing?

690
00:47:59,073 --> 00:48:01,158
Look, this is a bad time.

691
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:03,660
I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.

692
00:48:03,661 --> 00:48:07,414
- They're really fucked-up people...
- I'm on my way out.

693
00:48:07,415 --> 00:48:09,812
Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.

694
00:48:09,813 --> 00:48:12,107
I took what was left of a bottle.

695
00:48:12,212 --> 00:48:14,400
It might have been too much.

696
00:48:14,401 --> 00:48:18,154
Picture Marla Singer throw herself
around her crummy apartment.

697
00:48:18,155 --> 00:48:22,638
This isn't a for-real suicide thing.
This is probably a cry-for-help thing.

698
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:25,661
So you're staying in tonight, then?

699
00:48:25,662 --> 00:48:28,581
Do you wanna wait
and hear me describe death?

700
00:48:28,582 --> 00:48:33,379
Do you wanna listen
and see if my spirit can use a phone?

701
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,175
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?

702
00:49:04,347 --> 00:49:09,352
Tyler's door was closed. I'd been here for
two months and his door was never closed.

703
00:49:14,148 --> 00:49:17,380
You won't believe this dream
I had last night.

704
00:49:17,381 --> 00:49:20,717
I can hardly believe anything about last night.

705
00:49:30,415 --> 00:49:32,396
What are you doing here?

706
00:49:35,107 --> 00:49:37,295
What?

707
00:49:37,296 --> 00:49:39,799
This is my house.
What are you doing here?

708
00:49:42,093 --> 00:49:44,178
Fuck you!

709
00:49:58,776 --> 00:50:02,112
Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!

710
00:50:02,113 --> 00:50:04,198
Limber, though.

711
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:06,388
Silly cooze.

712
00:50:07,326 --> 00:50:10,141
I come in last night. Phone's off the hook.

713
00:50:10,142 --> 00:50:12,226
Guess who's on the other end?

714
00:50:12,227 --> 00:50:14,521
I knew the story before he told me.

715
00:50:16,711 --> 00:50:20,463
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?

716
00:50:20,464 --> 00:50:23,384
Do you think it'll live up to its name?

717
00:50:23,488 --> 00:50:27,138
Or will it just be a death hairball?

718
00:50:30,474 --> 00:50:34,436
Prepare to evacuate soul.

719
00:50:34,437 --> 00:50:36,208
Ten,

720
00:50:36,209 --> 00:50:39,024
nine, ... eight...

721
00:50:39,025 --> 00:50:41,422
How could Tyler, of all people,

722
00:50:41,423 --> 00:50:45,384
think it was a bad thing
that Marla Singer was about to die?

723
00:50:45,385 --> 00:50:47,052
Five,

724
00:50:47,053 --> 00:50:48,722
four...

725
00:50:49,452 --> 00:50:51,641
Hang on.

726
00:50:56,959 --> 00:50:59,357
You got here fast.

727
00:51:00,817 --> 00:51:03,007
Did I call you?

728
00:51:13,642 --> 00:51:16,875
The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic.

729
00:51:20,003 --> 00:51:22,505
Oh, don't worry. It's not a threat to you.

730
00:51:25,112 --> 00:51:27,093
Oh, fuck!

731
00:51:27,198 --> 00:51:29,387
Somebody called the cops.

732
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:44,819
- Hey, where's 513?
- End of the hall.

733
00:51:45,445 --> 00:51:49,406
The girl who lives there
used to be a charming, lovely girl.

734
00:51:49,407 --> 00:51:51,597
She has lost faith in herself.

735
00:51:51,701 --> 00:51:54,515
- Miss Singer, let us help you!
- She's a monster!

736
00:51:54,517 --> 00:51:58,791
- You have every reason to live.
- She's infectious human waste!

737
00:51:58,792 --> 00:52:02,754
- Miss Singer!
- Good luck trying to save her!

738
00:52:07,446 --> 00:52:09,636
If I fall asleep,

739
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:12,034
I'm done for.

740
00:52:13,911 --> 00:52:16,204
You're gonna have to keep me up

741
00:52:16,205 --> 00:52:18,393
all night.

742
00:52:18,394 --> 00:52:20,792
Un-fucking-believable.

743
00:52:20,793 --> 00:52:23,086
He was obviously able to handle it.

744
00:52:23,087 --> 00:52:26,839
- You know what I mean, you fucked her.
- No, I didn't.

745
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,030
- Never?
- No.

746
00:52:29,864 --> 00:52:32,053
You're not into her, are you?

747
00:52:32,054 --> 00:52:34,243
No! God, not at all.

748
00:52:34,244 --> 00:52:36,954
I am Jack's raging bile duct.

749
00:52:36,955 --> 00:52:38,936
Are you sure? You can tell me.

750
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,916
Believe me, I'm sure.

751
00:52:40,917 --> 00:52:44,357
- Put a gun to my head and spray my brains.
- That's good.

752
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:47,173
She's a predator posing as a house pet.
Stay away.

753
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:52,698
The shit that came out of
this woman's mouth, I had never heard!

754
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,472
My God.

755
00:52:54,576 --> 00:52:58,016
I haven't been fucked like that
since grade school.

756
00:52:58,017 --> 00:53:00,519
How could Tyler not go for that?

757
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:04,168
The other night,
he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.

758
00:53:04,169 --> 00:53:07,088
Marla doesn't need a lover,
just a case worker.

759
00:53:07,089 --> 00:53:09,695
Or a wash.
This isn't love, it's sport fucking.

760
00:53:09,696 --> 00:53:12,718
She invaded my support groups
and now my home.

761
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:14,805
Hey, hey. Sit down.

762
00:53:18,871 --> 00:53:22,416
Now, listen.
I can't have you talking to her about me.

763
00:53:22,417 --> 00:53:24,294
Why would I...

764
00:53:24,398 --> 00:53:29,715
Say anything about me or what goes on
in this house to her or anybody, ... we're done.

765
00:53:29,716 --> 00:53:32,530
- Now promise me. You promise?
- OK.

766
00:53:32,531 --> 00:53:34,720
- Yeah, I promise.
- Promise?

767
00:53:34,721 --> 00:53:38,266
- I just said, I promise! What...
- That's three times you promised.

768
00:53:39,621 --> 00:53:43,791
If only l had wasted a few minutes
and gone to watch Marla Singer die,

769
00:53:43,792 --> 00:53:45,878
none of this would have happened.

770
00:53:50,778 --> 00:53:53,802
Harder, yes! Oh, harder, harder!

771
00:54:00,267 --> 00:54:02,874
I could have moved to another room.

772
00:54:03,812 --> 00:54:07,773
On the third floor
where I might not have heard them.

773
00:54:07,774 --> 00:54:09,964
But I didn't.

774
00:54:34,051 --> 00:54:38,220
- What are you doing?
- Just going to bed.

775
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:40,411
Wanna finish her off?

776
00:54:43,226 --> 00:54:46,875
- No. No, thank you.
- I've found a cigarette.

777
00:54:46,876 --> 00:54:50,316
- Who were you talking to?
- Shut up.

778
00:54:50,317 --> 00:54:53,653
I became the calm little center of the world.

779
00:54:54,279 --> 00:54:56,469
I was the Zen master.

780
00:55:01,474 --> 00:55:03,559
I wrote little haiku poems.

781
00:55:04,185 --> 00:55:06,582
I e-mailed them to everyone.

782
00:55:06,583 --> 00:55:08,773
Is that your blood?

783
00:55:10,337 --> 00:55:12,421
Some of it, yeah.

784
00:55:12,422 --> 00:55:15,236
You can't smoke in here.

785
00:55:15,237 --> 00:55:17,322
Take the rest of the day off.

786
00:55:17,323 --> 00:55:19,929
Come back Monday with some clean clothes.

787
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:22,224
Get yourself together.

788
00:55:22,432 --> 00:55:24,934
I got right in everyone's hostile face.

789
00:55:24,935 --> 00:55:27,540
"Yes, these are bruises from fighting."

790
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:29,627
"Yes, I'm comfortable with that."

791
00:55:29,731 --> 00:55:31,608
"I am enlightened."

792
00:55:33,589 --> 00:55:38,697
You give up the condo life, give up
all your flaming worldly possessions,

793
00:55:38,698 --> 00:55:41,930
move to a dilapidated house
in a toxic waste area,

794
00:55:41,931 --> 00:55:45,893
and you have to come home to this.

795
00:55:56,424 --> 00:55:59,969
- Hello.
- This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.

796
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:04,244
We have some new information about
the incident at your former condo.

797
00:56:04,245 --> 00:56:05,599
Yes.

798
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:10,604
I don't know if you're aware, but someone
sprayed Freon into your front-door lock.

799
00:56:10,605 --> 00:56:13,315
They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.

800
00:56:13,316 --> 00:56:15,401
No, I wasn't aware of that.

801
00:56:15,402 --> 00:56:17,486
I am Jack's cold-sweat.

802
00:56:17,487 --> 00:56:19,884
Does this sound strange to you?

803
00:56:19,885 --> 00:56:22,804
Yes, sir, strange. Very strange.

804
00:56:22,805 --> 00:56:24,889
- The dynamite
- Dynamite?

805
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:28,122
Left a residue
of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.

806
00:56:28,123 --> 00:56:31,771
- Do you know what this means?
- No, what does it mean?

807
00:56:31,772 --> 00:56:33,752
It means it was home-made.

808
00:56:33,753 --> 00:56:38,027
I'm sorry. This is just coming
as quite a shock to me, sir.

809
00:56:38,028 --> 00:56:43,658
Whoever set this dynamite could have blown
out your pilot light days before the explosion.

810
00:56:43,659 --> 00:56:46,786
- The gas was just a detonator.
- Who would go and do that?

811
00:56:46,787 --> 00:56:48,977
- I'll ask the questions.
- Tell him.

812
00:56:49,081 --> 00:56:53,564
Tell him the liberator who destroyed
my property realigned my perceptions.

813
00:56:53,565 --> 00:56:55,649
Excuse me. Are you there?

814
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:58,673
I am listening.
It's hard to know what to make of this.

815
00:56:58,674 --> 00:57:03,261
Have you recently made enemies who might
have access to home-made dynamite?

816
00:57:03,262 --> 00:57:05,659
- Enemies?
- Reject civilization,

817
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,745
especially material possessions.

818
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:10,768
- Son, this is serious.
- Yes, I know it's serious.

819
00:57:10,769 --> 00:57:13,479
- I mean that.
- Yes, it's very serious.

820
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:16,295
Look, nobody takes this
more seriously than me.

821
00:57:16,296 --> 00:57:19,111
That condo was my life. OK?

822
00:57:19,215 --> 00:57:22,864
I loved every stick of furniture in that place.

823
00:57:22,865 --> 00:57:25,887
That was not just a bunch of stuff
that got destroyed.

824
00:57:25,889 --> 00:57:28,807
- It was me!
- I'd like to thank the Academy.

825
00:57:28,808 --> 00:57:33,082
- Is this not a good time for you?
- Just tell him you fucking did it!

826
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:36,940
Tell him you blew it all up!
That's what he wants to hear.

827
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:41,945
- Are you still there?
- Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?

828
00:57:41,946 --> 00:57:46,012
No. I may need to talk to you, so you
let me know if you're gonna leave town.

829
00:57:46,013 --> 00:57:48,515
- OK?
- OK.

830
00:57:51,122 --> 00:57:55,813
Except for their humping,
Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.

831
00:57:55,814 --> 00:57:58,941
My parents pulled this exact same act
for years.

832
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:02,799
The condom is the glass slipper
of our generation.

833
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,823
You slip one on when you meet a stranger.

834
00:58:05,824 --> 00:58:07,909
You... dance all night.

835
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:10,099
Then you throw it away.

836
00:58:10,308 --> 00:58:13,019
The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.

837
00:58:14,479 --> 00:58:15,938
What?

838
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:23,758
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.

839
00:58:23,759 --> 00:58:25,635
It was worth every penny.

840
00:58:25,636 --> 00:58:27,825
It's a bridesmaid's dress.

841
00:58:28,764 --> 00:58:31,891
Someone loved it intensely

842
00:58:31,892 --> 00:58:34,080
for one day.

843
00:58:34,082 --> 00:58:36,271
Then tossed it.

844
00:58:38,044 --> 00:58:40,232
Like a Christmas tree.

845
00:58:40,233 --> 00:58:42,422
So special.

846
00:58:42,423 --> 00:58:43,986
Then

847
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:45,760
bam!

848
00:58:45,968 --> 00:58:48,054
It's on the side of the road.

849
00:58:48,575 --> 00:58:50,765
Tinsel still clinging to it.

850
00:58:52,746 --> 00:58:54,830
Like a sex crime victim.

851
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:57,021
Underwear inside out.

852
00:58:57,647 --> 00:59:01,504
- Bound with electrical tape.
- Well then, it suits you.

853
00:59:01,505 --> 00:59:04,320
You can borrow it sometime.

854
00:59:11,202 --> 00:59:13,392
Get rid of her.

855
00:59:14,121 --> 00:59:17,144
- What? You get rid of her!
- Don't mention me.

856
00:59:17,145 --> 00:59:21,525
I am six years old again,
passing messages between parents.

857
00:59:23,297 --> 00:59:27,050
- I really think it's time you left.
- Don't worry, I'm leaving.

858
00:59:27,051 --> 00:59:31,847
- Not that we don't love your visits.
- You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.

859
00:59:33,829 --> 00:59:36,747
Gotta get off

860
00:59:36,748 --> 00:59:38,103
Thanks. Bye.

861
00:59:38,104 --> 00:59:44,256
Gotta get off of this merry-go-round

862
00:59:44,777 --> 00:59:48,738
Gonna get, need to get...

863
00:59:48,739 --> 00:59:50,929
Gotta get...

864
00:59:53,014 --> 00:59:54,474
You kids!

865
00:59:56,455 --> 00:59:59,061
Why do you still waste time with her?

866
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:01,459
I'll say this about Marla.

867
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,857
At least she's trying to hit bottom.

868
01:00:03,859 --> 01:00:05,213
And I'm not?

869
01:00:05,214 --> 01:00:08,133
Feathers up your butt
do not make you a chicken.

870
01:00:08,134 --> 01:00:10,323
What are we doing tonight?

871
01:00:10,845 --> 01:00:13,243
Tonight... we make soap.

872
01:00:13,973 --> 01:00:15,224
Really?

873
01:00:15,328 --> 01:00:18,248
To make soap, first we render fat.

874
01:00:37,017 --> 01:00:39,311
The salt balance has to be just right

875
01:00:39,415 --> 01:00:42,022
so the best fat for soap comes from humans.

876
01:00:42,751 --> 01:00:45,984
- Wait, what is this place?
- A liposuction clinic.

877
01:00:53,804 --> 01:00:55,993
Pay dirt!

878
01:00:55,994 --> 01:00:59,956
Richest, creamiest fat in the world.
Fat of the land!

879
01:01:05,378 --> 01:01:09,132
No! Don't pull it, don't pull it!

880
01:01:13,616 --> 01:01:16,014
- Oh, God!
- Give me another one.

881
01:01:22,061 --> 01:01:25,501
As the fat renders,
the tallows float to the surface.

882
01:01:25,502 --> 01:01:27,691
Like in Boy Scouts.

883
01:01:27,692 --> 01:01:31,654
- It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.
- Keep stirring.

884
01:01:33,948 --> 01:01:37,492
Once the tallow hardens,
you skim off a layer of glycerin.

885
01:01:37,494 --> 01:01:39,995
Add nitric acid, you've got nitroglycerin.

886
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:43,957
Then add sodium nitrate and sawdust,
you've got dynamite.

887
01:01:43,958 --> 01:01:47,815
Yeah, with enough soap,
one could blow up just about anything.

888
01:01:47,816 --> 01:01:50,005
Tyler was full of useful information.

889
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:53,967
People found clothes got cleaner
when washed at a certain point in the river.

890
01:01:53,968 --> 01:01:56,158
- You know why?
- No.

891
01:01:58,869 --> 01:02:02,830
Human sacrifices were once made
on the hills above this river.

892
01:02:02,831 --> 01:02:06,167
Bodies burnt.
Water permeated the ashes to create lye.

893
01:02:06,168 --> 01:02:08,565
This is lye. The crucial ingredient.

894
01:02:08,566 --> 01:02:13,466
Once it mixed with the melted body fat,
a white soapy discharge crept into the river.

895
01:02:13,467 --> 01:02:15,657
May I see your hand, please?

896
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:24,310
What is this?

897
01:02:24,311 --> 01:02:26,917
This is a chemical burn.

898
01:02:26,918 --> 01:02:30,462
It will hurt more than any burn
and it will leave a scar.

899
01:02:30,463 --> 01:02:33,278
Meditation worked for cancer,
it could work now.

900
01:02:34,008 --> 01:02:36,824
- Don't shut the pain out.
- Oh, God!

901
01:02:37,658 --> 01:02:42,140
The first soap was made from heroes' ashes,
like the first monkey shot into space.

902
01:02:42,141 --> 01:02:45,164
Without pain or sacrifice,
we would have nothing.

903
01:02:45,165 --> 01:02:48,188
I tried not to think
of the word searing of flesh.

904
01:02:48,189 --> 01:02:51,420
Stop it!
This is your pain, this is your burning hand.

905
01:02:51,421 --> 01:02:54,236
I'm going to my cave
to find my power animal.

906
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:58,302
No! Don't deal with this
the way those dead people do! Come on!

907
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:02,474
- I get the point!
- No! You're feeling premature enlightenment.

908
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:09,251
It's the greatest moment of your life,
and you're off somewhere else!

909
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:10,919
I am not!

910
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,944
Shut up!
Our fathers were our models for God.

911
01:03:14,048 --> 01:03:17,281
If our fathers bailed,
what does that tell you about God?

912
01:03:18,115 --> 01:03:23,536
Listen to me. You have to consider
the possibility that God does not like you.

913
01:03:23,537 --> 01:03:27,602
He never wanted you.
In all probability, He hates you.

914
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:31,356
This is not the worst thing that can happen.
We don't need Him!

915
01:03:31,357 --> 01:03:34,276
- I agree!
- Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.

916
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:36,882
We are God's unwanted children? So be it!

917
01:03:36,883 --> 01:03:41,576
- I'm getting water!
- You can use water and make it worse or...

918
01:03:42,618 --> 01:03:46,162
- Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.
- Please let me up!

919
01:03:46,163 --> 01:03:48,249
First, you have to give up.

920
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:51,167
First, you have to know, not fear,

921
01:03:51,168 --> 01:03:54,191
know that some day, you're gonna die.

922
01:03:54,192 --> 01:03:56,591
You don't know how this feels!

923
01:04:00,449 --> 01:04:04,932
It's only after we've lost everything
that we're free to do anything.

924
01:04:06,705 --> 01:04:08,894
OK.

925
01:04:22,137 --> 01:04:24,221
Congratulations.

926
01:04:24,222 --> 01:04:27,246
You're one step closer to hitting the bottom.

927
01:04:30,061 --> 01:04:33,293
Tyler sold his soap
to department stores at $20 a bar.

928
01:04:33,294 --> 01:04:35,274
God knows what they charged.

929
01:04:35,275 --> 01:04:38,715
- This is the best soap.
- Why, thank you, Susan.

930
01:04:38,716 --> 01:04:40,800
It was beautiful.

931
01:04:40,801 --> 01:04:44,868
We were selling rich women
their own fat asses back to them.

932
01:04:45,702 --> 01:04:47,891
He was wearing his yellow tie.

933
01:04:47,892 --> 01:04:50,186
I didn't wear a tie to work anymore.

934
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:54,043
"The first rule of Fight Club
is don't talk about Fight Club."

935
01:04:54,044 --> 01:04:57,588
I'm half-asleep again.
I must have left it in the copy machine.

936
01:04:57,589 --> 01:05:00,196
"The second rule..." Is this yours?

937
01:05:01,968 --> 01:05:05,617
Pretend you're me.
Make a managerial decision.

938
01:05:05,618 --> 01:05:08,224
You find this. What would you do?

939
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:14,792
Well, I gotta tell you,

940
01:05:14,793 --> 01:05:18,546
I'd be very, very careful
who you talk to about that.

941
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:21,883
Because the person who wrote that
is dangerous.

942
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:26,471
And this button-down, Oxford-cloth psycho
might just snap

943
01:05:26,472 --> 01:05:29,495
and then stalk from office to office

944
01:05:29,496 --> 01:05:34,604
with an Armalite AR10 carbine gas-powered
semiautomatic weapon,

945
01:05:34,605 --> 01:05:39,297
pumping round after round
into colleagues and co-workers.

946
01:05:39,714 --> 01:05:43,154
This might be someone
you've known for years.

947
01:05:43,155 --> 01:05:46,386
Someone very, very close to you.

948
01:05:46,387 --> 01:05:49,933
Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.

949
01:05:50,767 --> 01:05:52,851
And I used to be such a nice guy.

950
01:05:52,852 --> 01:05:56,397
Or maybe you shouldn't bring me
every piece of trash you pick up.

951
01:06:00,151 --> 01:06:04,009
- Compliance and Liability.
- My tit's gonna rot off.

952
01:06:04,739 --> 01:06:07,450
Will you excuse me? I need to take this.

953
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:17,251
- What do you mean?
- I need you to check for a lump in my breast.

954
01:06:17,252 --> 01:06:21,318
- Go to a hospital.
- I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.

955
01:06:22,152 --> 01:06:24,446
I don't know about this, Marla.

956
01:06:24,551 --> 01:06:26,322
Please.

957
01:06:26,323 --> 01:06:30,494
She didn't call Tyler. I'm neutral in her book.

958
01:06:32,371 --> 01:06:36,541
That's nice.
Taking food to Mrs Haniver and Mrs Raines.

959
01:06:36,542 --> 01:06:38,730
Where are they, exactly?

960
01:06:38,731 --> 01:06:42,901
Tragically, they're dead.
I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?

961
01:06:42,902 --> 01:06:44,987
- No, no.
- I got one for you.

962
01:06:44,988 --> 01:06:47,177
Thanks for the thought.

963
01:06:48,533 --> 01:06:50,930
What happened to your hand?

964
01:06:50,931 --> 01:06:53,120
Oh, nothing.

965
01:06:53,121 --> 01:06:55,310
Right there?

966
01:06:56,249 --> 01:06:58,959
- Feel anything?
- No.

967
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,045
Well, make sure.

968
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:03,234
OK, I'm pretty sure.

969
01:07:03,235 --> 01:07:05,320
You feel nothing?

970
01:07:05,425 --> 01:07:07,719
No, nothing.

971
01:07:09,178 --> 01:07:12,098
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.

972
01:07:13,558 --> 01:07:16,893
- No problem.
- I wish I could return the favor.

973
01:07:16,894 --> 01:07:19,083
Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.

974
01:07:19,084 --> 01:07:22,732
- I could check your prostate.
- I think I'm OK.

975
01:07:22,734 --> 01:07:24,923
Well, thanks, anyway.

976
01:07:29,824 --> 01:07:32,221
- Are we done?
- Yeah, we're done.

977
01:07:32,222 --> 01:07:34,516
See you... around.

978
01:07:51,616 --> 01:07:53,805
Cornelius?

979
01:07:53,806 --> 01:07:56,308
Cornelius!

980
01:07:56,309 --> 01:07:59,123
It's me! Bob!

981
01:07:59,124 --> 01:08:00,584
Hey, Bob.

982
01:08:04,129 --> 01:08:07,048
- We all thought you were dead.
- No, no. Still here.

983
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:11,323
- How are you, Bob?
- Better than I've ever been in my whole life.

984
01:08:11,324 --> 01:08:14,868
- Really? Still remaining men together?
- No, no.

985
01:08:14,869 --> 01:08:18,727
- I got something so much better now.
- Really, what is it?

986
01:08:19,248 --> 01:08:21,125
Well...

987
01:08:21,229 --> 01:08:25,608
The first rule is,
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

988
01:08:25,609 --> 01:08:27,797
And the second rule is

989
01:08:27,798 --> 01:08:30,196
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

990
01:08:30,197 --> 01:08:33,741
- And the third rule is...
- Bob, Bob. I'm a member.

991
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:35,932
Look at my face, Bob.

992
01:08:38,225 --> 01:08:40,623
That's fucking... fucking great.

993
01:08:40,624 --> 01:08:44,376
- I've never seen you there.
- I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.

994
01:08:44,377 --> 01:08:48,235
- I go Saturday.
- Congratulations.

995
01:08:48,444 --> 01:08:50,945
Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?

996
01:08:50,946 --> 01:08:53,658
Have you heard about the guy
that invented it?

997
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:56,681
- Yeah, actually...
- I hear all kinds of things.

998
01:08:56,786 --> 01:09:00,434
Supposedly,
he was born in a mental institution

999
01:09:00,435 --> 01:09:03,875
and he sleeps only one hour a night.

1000
01:09:03,876 --> 01:09:06,170
He's a great man.

1001
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:10,028
Do you know about Tyler Durden?

1002
01:09:34,844 --> 01:09:37,034
I didn't hurt you, did I?

1003
01:09:37,138 --> 01:09:39,223
Actually, you did.

1004
01:09:39,224 --> 01:09:41,413
Thank you for this.

1005
01:09:41,622 --> 01:09:44,019
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1006
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:46,209
Fight Club.

1007
01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:48,400
This was mine and Tyler's gift.

1008
01:09:48,504 --> 01:09:50,588
Our gift to the world.

1009
01:09:50,589 --> 01:09:54,030
I look around, I look around,
I see a lot of new faces.

1010
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:57,783
Shut up!

1011
01:09:57,784 --> 01:10:02,893
Which means a lot of people have been
breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.

1012
01:10:11,026 --> 01:10:15,196
I see in Fight Club the strongest
and smartest men who've ever lived.

1013
01:10:15,197 --> 01:10:17,282
I see all this potential.

1014
01:10:17,283 --> 01:10:19,472
And I see it squandered.

1015
01:10:20,411 --> 01:10:23,643
Goddamn it,
an entire generation pumping gas.

1016
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:26,249
Waiting tables.

1017
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:28,335
Slaves with white collars.

1018
01:10:30,838 --> 01:10:33,965
Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes.

1019
01:10:33,966 --> 01:10:37,407
Working jobs we hate
so we can buy shit we don't need.

1020
01:10:41,161 --> 01:10:43,662
We're the middle children of history.

1021
01:10:43,663 --> 01:10:45,853
No purpose or place.

1022
01:10:45,957 --> 01:10:48,147
We have no Great War.

1023
01:10:48,355 --> 01:10:50,545
No Great Depression.

1024
01:10:52,213 --> 01:10:54,716
Our great war is a spiritual war.

1025
01:10:55,029 --> 01:10:58,574
Our great depression is our lives.

1026
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:04,412
We've all been raised
on television to believe

1027
01:11:04,413 --> 01:11:08,166
that one day we'd be millionaires
and movie gods and rock stars.

1028
01:11:08,167 --> 01:11:10,251
But we won't.

1029
01:11:10,252 --> 01:11:12,858
We're slowly learning that fact.

1030
01:11:12,859 --> 01:11:15,360
And we're very, very pissed off.

1031
01:11:15,361 --> 01:11:17,134
Yeah!

1032
01:11:19,949 --> 01:11:24,537
First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...

1033
01:11:29,855 --> 01:11:31,210
Who are you?

1034
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:34,651
- Who am I?
- Yeah.

1035
01:11:35,486 --> 01:11:38,405
There's a sign on the front
that says Lou's Tavern.

1036
01:11:39,344 --> 01:11:43,409
I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?

1037
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:45,600
Tyler Durden.

1038
01:11:48,624 --> 01:11:52,168
Who told you motherfuckers
that you could use my place?

1039
01:11:52,169 --> 01:11:54,566
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

1040
01:11:54,567 --> 01:11:57,277
Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.

1041
01:11:57,278 --> 01:11:59,468
He don't own this place. I do.

1042
01:12:01,553 --> 01:12:05,202
- How much money's he getting for this?
- There is no money.

1043
01:12:05,203 --> 01:12:08,017
- Free to all.
- Ain't that something?

1044
01:12:08,018 --> 01:12:09,998
It is, actually.

1045
01:12:09,999 --> 01:12:12,501
Look, stupid fuck!

1046
01:12:12,502 --> 01:12:15,108
- I want everybody out of here right now.
- Hey!

1047
01:12:15,213 --> 01:12:17,507
You should join our club.

1048
01:12:17,819 --> 01:12:19,799
Did you hear what I just said?

1049
01:12:19,801 --> 01:12:22,094
You and your friend.

1050
01:12:23,763 --> 01:12:26,057
You hear me now?

1051
01:12:28,142 --> 01:12:30,228
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.

1052
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:38,465
Still not getting it.

1053
01:12:39,403 --> 01:12:41,592
OK, OK, I got it.

1054
01:12:41,593 --> 01:12:44,200
I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.

1055
01:12:45,138 --> 01:12:47,015
Back! All of you!

1056
01:12:48,788 --> 01:12:50,873
Everybody back!

1057
01:12:58,276 --> 01:13:00,569
Ah, Lou!

1058
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:04,324
Come on, man!
We really like this place.

1059
01:13:13,291 --> 01:13:16,314
- That's right, Lou. Get it out.
- Shut the fuck up.

1060
01:13:16,315 --> 01:13:18,192
Oh, yeah!

1061
01:13:23,093 --> 01:13:25,282
Is that fucking funny?

1062
01:13:34,667 --> 01:13:37,378
Fucking guy is a loony, I'm telling you.

1063
01:13:38,212 --> 01:13:39,985
Unbelievable.

1064
01:13:44,051 --> 01:13:47,074
- You don't know where I've been, Lou.
- Oh, my God!

1065
01:13:47,075 --> 01:13:50,099
You don't know where I've been!

1066
01:13:53,123 --> 01:13:56,250
Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!

1067
01:13:56,251 --> 01:13:58,752
Fucking use the basement! Christ!

1068
01:13:58,753 --> 01:14:01,776
I want your word, Lou! I want your word!

1069
01:14:01,777 --> 01:14:03,863
On my mother's eyes.

1070
01:14:12,830 --> 01:14:15,020
Thanks, Lou.

1071
01:14:16,271 --> 01:14:18,460
You too, big guy.

1072
01:14:22,423 --> 01:14:24,612
We'll see you next week.

1073
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:43,693
This week, each one of you
has a homework assignment.

1074
01:14:43,694 --> 01:14:48,699
You're gonna go out. You're gonna
start a fight with a total stranger.

1075
01:14:51,723 --> 01:14:54,016
You're gonna start a fight

1076
01:14:54,017 --> 01:14:56,206
and you're gonna lose.

1077
01:14:58,083 --> 01:15:00,064
Excellent choice, sir.

1078
01:15:02,567 --> 01:15:06,008
Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!

1079
01:15:06,321 --> 01:15:09,032
Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.

1080
01:15:11,534 --> 01:15:13,619
Son of a bitch!

1081
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:18,520
Most people, normal people,
do just about anything to avoid a fight.

1082
01:15:19,355 --> 01:15:21,439
Excuse me!

1083
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:25,297
You sprayed me with your hose.
That's not necessary...

1084
01:15:25,298 --> 01:15:27,279
Jay! Go call 911!

1085
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:32,074
Put the hose down.

1086
01:15:32,076 --> 01:15:34,265
Stop it! Stop it!

1087
01:15:35,829 --> 01:15:37,810
Sorry.

1088
01:15:53,242 --> 01:15:55,745
We need to talk.

1089
01:15:57,935 --> 01:16:00,123
OK.

1090
01:16:00,124 --> 01:16:02,210
Where to begin?

1091
01:16:02,314 --> 01:16:04,607
With your constant absenteeism?

1092
01:16:04,608 --> 01:16:07,318
With your unpresentable appearance?

1093
01:16:07,319 --> 01:16:09,403
You're up for review.

1094
01:16:09,404 --> 01:16:12,636
I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.

1095
01:16:12,637 --> 01:16:14,617
- What?
- Let's pretend.

1096
01:16:14,618 --> 01:16:17,536
You're the Department of Transportation,
OK?

1097
01:16:17,538 --> 01:16:21,394
Someone informs you that this company

1098
01:16:21,396 --> 01:16:25,565
installs front-seat mounting brackets
that failed collision tests,

1099
01:16:25,566 --> 01:16:29,006
brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,

1100
01:16:29,007 --> 01:16:33,594
and fuel injectors
that explode and burn people alive.

1101
01:16:33,595 --> 01:16:35,471
What then?

1102
01:16:35,472 --> 01:16:37,869
Are you threatening me?

1103
01:16:37,870 --> 01:16:40,789
- No...
- Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!

1104
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:45,272
I have a better solution. Keep me
on the payroll as an outside consultant.

1105
01:16:45,274 --> 01:16:47,462
In exchange for my salary,

1106
01:16:47,463 --> 01:16:51,320
my job will be never to tell people
these things that I know.

1107
01:16:51,321 --> 01:16:55,805
I don't even have to come into the office.
I can do this job from home.

1108
01:16:56,848 --> 01:17:01,227
Who... Who the fuck do you think you are,
you crazy little shit?

1109
01:17:06,232 --> 01:17:09,986
- Security!
- I am Jack's smirking revenge.

1110
01:17:18,849 --> 01:17:20,934
What the hell are you doing?

1111
01:17:30,214 --> 01:17:32,404
That hurt.

1112
01:17:33,655 --> 01:17:35,845
Why would you do that?

1113
01:17:36,366 --> 01:17:39,494
Oh, my God! No! Please stop!

1114
01:17:48,774 --> 01:17:50,964
What are you doing?

1115
01:17:52,007 --> 01:17:54,091
Oh, God, no! Please! No!

1116
01:17:54,092 --> 01:17:58,262
For some reason,
I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.

1117
01:17:58,263 --> 01:17:59,931
No!

1118
01:18:24,331 --> 01:18:28,813
Under and behind and inside
everything this man took for granted,

1119
01:18:28,814 --> 01:18:32,463
something horrible had been growing.

1120
01:18:32,464 --> 01:18:33,610
Look.

1121
01:18:33,611 --> 01:18:38,406
Give me the paychecks, like I asked,
and you won't ever see me again.

1122
01:18:38,407 --> 01:18:41,327
Then, at our most excellent
moment together...

1123
01:18:44,246 --> 01:18:47,061
Thank God!
Please don't hit me again.

1124
01:18:47,062 --> 01:18:49,250
Telephone, computer,

1125
01:18:49,251 --> 01:18:54,568
fax machine, 52 weekly paychecks
and 48 airline flight coupons.

1126
01:18:54,569 --> 01:18:57,071
We now had corporate sponsorship.

1127
01:18:57,072 --> 01:19:02,389
This is how Tyler and I were able to have
Fight Club every night of the week.

1128
01:19:04,892 --> 01:19:08,540
Now, the center of Fight Club
became the two men fighting.

1129
01:19:08,541 --> 01:19:12,087
The leader walked through the crowd,
out in the darkness.

1130
01:19:13,755 --> 01:19:18,342
Tyler was now involved in
a lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel

1131
01:19:18,343 --> 01:19:20,741
over the urine content of their soup.

1132
01:19:25,746 --> 01:19:28,874
I am Jack's wasted life.

1133
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:38,780
Thank you, sir.

1134
01:19:40,135 --> 01:19:43,262
Tyler dreamed up
new homework assignments.

1135
01:19:43,263 --> 01:19:45,870
He handed them out in sealed envelopes.

1136
01:20:24,867 --> 01:20:28,725
- There's a Fight Club up in Delaware City.
- Yeah, I heard.

1137
01:20:30,394 --> 01:20:32,687
There's one in Penns Grove too.

1138
01:20:32,688 --> 01:20:34,982
Bob even found one up in New Castle.

1139
01:20:35,086 --> 01:20:38,109
- Did you start that one?
- No, I thought you did.

1140
01:20:38,110 --> 01:20:40,717
No.

1141
01:21:29,515 --> 01:21:31,808
- Stop for a second.
- Hey, what are we doing?

1142
01:21:31,809 --> 01:21:33,895
- Turn around.
- What are we doing?

1143
01:21:33,999 --> 01:21:36,396
- Homework assignment.
- What kind?

1144
01:21:36,397 --> 01:21:38,482
Human sacrifice.

1145
01:21:38,587 --> 01:21:41,922
- Is that a gun? Please tell me it's not.
- It's a gun.

1146
01:21:41,923 --> 01:21:44,425
- What are you doing?
- Meet me in the back.

1147
01:21:44,426 --> 01:21:46,823
- Don't fuck around!
- Meet me in the back.

1148
01:21:46,824 --> 01:21:48,700
On a long enough time line,

1149
01:21:48,701 --> 01:21:51,725
the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.

1150
01:21:52,663 --> 01:21:54,748
What are you doing? Come on!

1151
01:21:54,749 --> 01:21:58,294
Hands behind your back.
Give me your wallet.

1152
01:21:59,962 --> 01:22:03,403
Raymond K Hessel.
1320 SE Banning, Apartment A.

1153
01:22:04,029 --> 01:22:07,364
- Small, cramped basement apartment?
- How did you know?

1154
01:22:07,365 --> 01:22:10,075
They give shitty apartments letters.

1155
01:22:10,076 --> 01:22:13,204
Raymond! You're going to die.

1156
01:22:13,205 --> 01:22:14,769
No!

1157
01:22:14,873 --> 01:22:19,043
Is that your mom and dad?
They're gonna have to call the kindly doctor.

1158
01:22:19,044 --> 01:22:21,441
Pick up your dental records. Know why?

1159
01:22:21,442 --> 01:22:25,090
- There'll be nothing left of your face.
- Oh, come on!

1160
01:22:25,091 --> 01:22:29,053
An expired community college student ID.
What did you study, Raymond?

1161
01:22:29,054 --> 01:22:32,181
- S... S... Stuff.
- Stuff?

1162
01:22:32,182 --> 01:22:34,372
Were the midterms hard?

1163
01:22:35,414 --> 01:22:38,020
- I asked you what you studied!
- Biology, mostly.

1164
01:22:38,021 --> 01:22:41,669
- Why?
- I don't know.

1165
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:44,799
What did you wanna be, Raymond K Hessel?!

1166
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:50,221
The question, Raymond,
was what did you want to be?

1167
01:22:51,785 --> 01:22:53,870
Answer him, Raymond, Jesus!

1168
01:22:53,974 --> 01:22:56,476
- Veterinarian. Veterinarian.
- Animals.

1169
01:22:56,477 --> 01:22:59,395
- Yeah. Animals and stuff.
- Stuff. Yeah, I got that.

1170
01:22:59,396 --> 01:23:02,106
- So you need more schooling.
- Too much school.

1171
01:23:02,108 --> 01:23:04,609
- Would you rather be dead?
- No, please...

1172
01:23:04,610 --> 01:23:09,093
You'd rather die here, on your knees,
in the back of a convenience store?

1173
01:23:09,094 --> 01:23:10,866
Please, no.

1174
01:23:14,933 --> 01:23:17,018
I'm keeping your license.

1175
01:23:18,269 --> 01:23:21,292
Gonna check in on you.
I know where you live.

1176
01:23:21,293 --> 01:23:24,420
If you're not working
to be a veterinarian in six weeks,

1177
01:23:24,421 --> 01:23:26,611
you will be dead.

1178
01:23:28,488 --> 01:23:30,573
Now run on home.

1179
01:23:35,266 --> 01:23:37,351
Run, Forrest, run!

1180
01:23:38,915 --> 01:23:41,105
I feel ill.

1181
01:23:41,835 --> 01:23:43,919
Imagine how he feels.

1182
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,109
Come on, this isn't funny!

1183
01:23:46,110 --> 01:23:48,611
What the fuck was the point of that?!

1184
01:23:48,612 --> 01:23:52,886
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day
of Raymond K Hessel's life.

1185
01:23:52,887 --> 01:23:57,475
His breakfast will taste better
than any meal you and I have ever tasted.

1186
01:23:58,622 --> 01:24:00,811
You had to give it to him.

1187
01:24:00,812 --> 01:24:03,209
- Come on.
- He had a plan.

1188
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:06,859
And it started to make sense
in a Tyler-sort of way.

1189
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:08,840
No fear. No distractions.

1190
01:24:08,841 --> 01:24:12,281
The ability to let that which does not matter

1191
01:24:12,282 --> 01:24:14,367
truly slide.

1192
01:24:27,609 --> 01:24:29,799
You are not your job.

1193
01:24:31,676 --> 01:24:35,221
You're not how much money
you have in the bank.

1194
01:24:36,785 --> 01:24:38,975
You're not the car you drive.

1195
01:24:39,288 --> 01:24:42,206
You're not the contents of your wallet.

1196
01:24:42,207 --> 01:24:44,710
You're not your fucking khakis.

1197
01:24:47,421 --> 01:24:51,279
You are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1198
01:24:59,933 --> 01:25:02,227
I'll be out of your way in a sec.

1199
01:25:02,957 --> 01:25:05,147
You don't have to go.

1200
01:25:06,502 --> 01:25:08,692
Whatever.

1201
01:25:09,735 --> 01:25:12,967
No, I mean... It's OK.

1202
01:25:22,351 --> 01:25:24,645
Are you still going to groups?

1203
01:25:25,167 --> 01:25:27,356
Yeah.

1204
01:25:28,712 --> 01:25:30,902
Chloe's dead.

1205
01:25:31,319 --> 01:25:33,403
Wow, Chloe.

1206
01:25:33,404 --> 01:25:35,385
When did that happen?

1207
01:25:35,907 --> 01:25:37,782
Do you care?

1208
01:25:37,784 --> 01:25:41,329
I dunno. I haven't thought about it in a while.

1209
01:25:41,537 --> 01:25:43,622
Yeah, well...

1210
01:25:43,623 --> 01:25:46,125
It was the smart move on her part.

1211
01:25:47,376 --> 01:25:49,566
Listen...

1212
01:25:50,713 --> 01:25:53,111
What are you getting out of all this?

1213
01:25:53,737 --> 01:25:55,926
What?

1214
01:25:55,927 --> 01:25:58,429
I mean, all this. Why do you keep...

1215
01:25:59,055 --> 01:26:01,244
Is this making you happy?

1216
01:26:02,704 --> 01:26:04,894
Yeah, well, sometimes.

1217
01:26:06,562 --> 01:26:08,751
I don't know. I don't understand.

1218
01:26:08,752 --> 01:26:12,400
Why does a weaker person
need to latch on to a strong person?

1219
01:26:12,401 --> 01:26:14,590
What is... What is that?

1220
01:26:14,591 --> 01:26:16,781
What do you get out of it?

1221
01:26:18,241 --> 01:26:20,429
No... That's not the same thing at all.

1222
01:26:20,430 --> 01:26:22,619
It's totally different with us.

1223
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:24,704
Us?

1224
01:26:24,705 --> 01:26:26,685
What do you mean by us?

1225
01:26:26,686 --> 01:26:30,752
- I'm sorry. Do you hear this?
- Hear what?

1226
01:26:30,753 --> 01:26:32,837
- All that noise. Hold on.
- No, wait!

1227
01:26:32,838 --> 01:26:35,653
Don't change the subject!
I want to talk about this.

1228
01:26:35,654 --> 01:26:38,572
- You're not talking about me, are you?
- No.

1229
01:26:38,573 --> 01:26:42,013
- What?
- Playing doctor. What was going on there?

1230
01:26:42,014 --> 01:26:45,454
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1231
01:26:45,455 --> 01:26:47,541
- I don't think so.
- What do you want?

1232
01:26:47,645 --> 01:26:50,147
- Look at me.
- No. What?

1233
01:26:50,773 --> 01:26:53,587
- What is that?!
- It's nothing. Don't worry.

1234
01:26:53,588 --> 01:26:56,090
My God. Who did this?

1235
01:26:56,091 --> 01:26:58,279
- A person.
- Guy or girl?

1236
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:01,199
- What do you care?
- What do you care if I ask?

1237
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:03,806
- Leave me alone.
- You're afraid to say.

1238
01:27:03,807 --> 01:27:05,891
- I am not. Let me go.
- No! Talk to me.

1239
01:27:05,892 --> 01:27:07,143
Let go of me!

1240
01:27:07,248 --> 01:27:10,062
- This conversation
- This conversation

1241
01:27:10,063 --> 01:27:12,566
- is over.
- Is over.

1242
01:27:13,295 --> 01:27:16,528
I just can't win with you, can I?

1243
01:27:25,808 --> 01:27:28,310
Hey, this is getting a little old!

1244
01:27:28,832 --> 01:27:31,229
What is... What is all this?

1245
01:27:31,230 --> 01:27:33,420
What do you think?

1246
01:27:34,358 --> 01:27:36,547
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?

1247
01:27:36,548 --> 01:27:38,425
Hey!

1248
01:27:45,202 --> 01:27:47,078
Too young.

1249
01:27:47,079 --> 01:27:48,747
Sorry.

1250
01:27:48,852 --> 01:27:51,040
What's all that?

1251
01:27:51,041 --> 01:27:54,064
If the applicant is young,
tell him he's too young.

1252
01:27:54,065 --> 01:27:56,775
- Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
- Applicant?

1253
01:27:56,776 --> 01:28:00,216
If the applicant waits three days
without food or shelter,

1254
01:28:00,217 --> 01:28:02,406
he may enter and begin training.

1255
01:28:02,407 --> 01:28:04,284
Training for what?

1256
01:28:09,810 --> 01:28:11,999
You think this is a game?

1257
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,710
You're too young to train here, end of story.

1258
01:28:14,711 --> 01:28:17,526
Quit wasting our time.
Get the fuck out of here.

1259
01:28:21,384 --> 01:28:23,470
Bad news, friend.

1260
01:28:23,678 --> 01:28:25,868
It's not gonna happen.

1261
01:28:25,972 --> 01:28:28,369
Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.

1262
01:28:28,370 --> 01:28:30,350
It's not the end of the world.

1263
01:28:30,351 --> 01:28:32,645
Just... go away.

1264
01:28:33,375 --> 01:28:35,564
Go.

1265
01:28:35,565 --> 01:28:39,319
You're trespassing
and I will have to call the police.

1266
01:28:42,238 --> 01:28:44,427
Don't you look at me!

1267
01:28:44,428 --> 01:28:47,764
You're never getting in this fucking house!

1268
01:28:47,765 --> 01:28:51,204
Never. Now get the fuck off my porch!
Get off my porch!

1269
01:28:51,206 --> 01:28:54,855
Sooner or later,
we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.

1270
01:28:54,959 --> 01:28:57,879
I'm gonna go inside
and I'm gonna get a shovel.

1271
01:29:05,178 --> 01:29:07,471
- Got two black shirts?
- Yes, sir.

1272
01:29:07,472 --> 01:29:09,869
- Two pair of black pants?
- Yes, sir.

1273
01:29:09,870 --> 01:29:12,893
- One pair black boots? Black socks?
- Yes, sir.

1274
01:29:12,894 --> 01:29:15,082
- One black jacket.
- Yes, sir.

1275
01:29:15,083 --> 01:29:18,212
- $300 personal burial money?
- Yes, sir.

1276
01:29:20,193 --> 01:29:22,382
All right.

1277
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:34,268
You're too old, fat man.

1278
01:29:34,269 --> 01:29:37,606
Your tits are too big.
Get the fuck off my porch.

1279
01:29:45,322 --> 01:29:47,407
Bob! Bob!

1280
01:30:03,361 --> 01:30:06,176
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.

1281
01:30:06,802 --> 01:30:08,262
Space monkey.

1282
01:30:08,366 --> 01:30:12,015
Ready to sacrifice himself
for the greater good.

1283
01:30:18,376 --> 01:30:21,190
You are too fucking old, fatty!

1284
01:30:21,191 --> 01:30:24,527
And you... You're too fucking

1285
01:30:24,528 --> 01:30:26,195
blond!

1286
01:30:26,196 --> 01:30:28,593
Get out of here, the both of you!

1287
01:30:28,594 --> 01:30:30,784
And so it went.

1288
01:30:30,888 --> 01:30:33,077
Listen up, maggots.

1289
01:30:33,078 --> 01:30:35,268
You are not special.

1290
01:30:35,476 --> 01:30:38,916
You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.

1291
01:30:38,917 --> 01:30:43,400
You are the same decaying organic matter
as everything else.

1292
01:30:43,401 --> 01:30:45,590
Tyler built himself an army.

1293
01:30:45,695 --> 01:30:49,447
We are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1294
01:30:49,448 --> 01:30:53,306
We are all part of the same compost heap.

1295
01:30:54,141 --> 01:30:57,372
Why was Tyler Durden building an army?

1296
01:30:57,373 --> 01:30:59,563
To what purpose?

1297
01:30:59,667 --> 01:31:02,169
For what greater good?

1298
01:31:05,402 --> 01:31:07,487
In Tyler we trusted.

1299
01:31:12,805 --> 01:31:15,619
When he was like,
"You are not your job",

1300
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:17,706
I was like, "Yeah!"

1301
01:31:19,478 --> 01:31:21,667
Hey, what's all this?

1302
01:31:21,668 --> 01:31:23,858
Hey!

1303
01:31:25,317 --> 01:31:26,985
OK!

1304
01:31:26,986 --> 01:31:29,487
- What's going on?
- We're celebrating.

1305
01:31:29,488 --> 01:31:32,095
- What are we celebrating?
- Go on.

1306
01:31:36,057 --> 01:31:38,351
- Hey.
- Let me get that for you.

1307
01:31:42,835 --> 01:31:45,859
The same great taste, Pepsi.

1308
01:31:48,048 --> 01:31:50,341
Ssh!

1309
01:31:50,342 --> 01:31:54,199
Investigators are here.
The Police Commissioner has arrived.

1310
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:57,328
Could you tell us
what you think has happened here?

1311
01:31:57,329 --> 01:32:01,603
We believe this is one of many
recent acts of vandalism in the city

1312
01:32:01,604 --> 01:32:04,835
somehow related
to underground boxing clubs.

1313
01:32:04,836 --> 01:32:09,215
We will be coordinating
a rigorous investigation.

1314
01:32:09,945 --> 01:32:14,428
That was Police Commissioner Jacobs
who just arrived on the scene

1315
01:32:14,429 --> 01:32:18,807
- of a four-alarm fire that broke out...
- She's hot.

1316
01:32:18,808 --> 01:32:20,684
Back to you in the studio.

1317
01:32:20,685 --> 01:32:23,188
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1318
01:32:24,022 --> 01:32:26,629
- Holy shit!
- Yeah!

1319
01:32:33,928 --> 01:32:36,012
What the fuck did you guys do?

1320
01:32:36,013 --> 01:32:40,288
Arson investigators
are on the premises...

1321
01:32:43,833 --> 01:32:48,630
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions, sir.

1322
01:32:54,573 --> 01:32:57,179
The victory in the war against crime

1323
01:32:57,180 --> 01:32:59,369
will not come overnight.

1324
01:32:59,370 --> 01:33:03,956
It will take dedication and commitment
and, most of all, cooperation.

1325
01:33:03,957 --> 01:33:08,961
Streets are safer now.
There is hope in the inner city. However...

1326
01:33:08,962 --> 01:33:11,048
I gotta take a piss.

1327
01:33:11,152 --> 01:33:13,862
These are the first steps in a long journey.

1328
01:33:13,863 --> 01:33:16,573
That is why we have created Project Hope.

1329
01:33:16,574 --> 01:33:18,764
Bob.

1330
01:33:21,788 --> 01:33:24,706
Project Hope will be a joint effort

1331
01:33:24,707 --> 01:33:27,522
between the police and community leaders.

1332
01:33:27,523 --> 01:33:31,902
It will be a powerful new weapon
in the war against crime.

1333
01:34:17,155 --> 01:34:21,535
- Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack.
- His balls are ice cold.

1334
01:34:23,307 --> 01:34:26,747
Hi. You're gonna call off
your rigorous investigation.

1335
01:34:26,748 --> 01:34:30,188
You will publicly state
there is no underground group or

1336
01:34:30,189 --> 01:34:32,588
these guys are gonna take your balls.

1337
01:34:33,422 --> 01:34:37,174
They'll send one to the New York Times
and one to the LA Times.

1338
01:34:37,175 --> 01:34:39,051
Look.

1339
01:34:39,052 --> 01:34:42,179
The people you are after
are the people you depend on.

1340
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:45,933
We cook your meals. We haul your trash.
We connect your calls.

1341
01:34:45,934 --> 01:34:49,792
We drive your ambulances.
We guard you while you sleep.

1342
01:34:54,067 --> 01:34:56,987
Do not fuck with us.

1343
01:35:04,286 --> 01:35:06,475
Ball check!

1344
01:35:20,656 --> 01:35:22,846
Bob, you're this way.

1345
01:35:23,889 --> 01:35:26,286
Let's go.

1346
01:35:26,287 --> 01:35:29,624
I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.

1347
01:35:30,562 --> 01:35:32,752
Hey!

1348
01:35:47,245 --> 01:35:48,601
Yeah!

1349
01:36:21,342 --> 01:36:24,052
I felt like putting a bullet in every panda

1350
01:36:24,053 --> 01:36:28,119
that wouldn't screw to save its species.

1351
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:33,019
I wanted to open the dump valves
on oil tankers

1352
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:36,044
and smother those French beaches
I'd never see.

1353
01:36:39,068 --> 01:36:41,675
I wanted to breathe smoke.

1354
01:36:58,983 --> 01:37:01,173
Where did you go, psycho boy?

1355
01:37:02,841 --> 01:37:05,970
I felt like destroying something beautiful.

1356
01:37:09,306 --> 01:37:11,391
Get him to a fucking hospital.

1357
01:37:11,392 --> 01:37:13,581
Yeah.

1358
01:37:24,321 --> 01:37:27,554
Don't worry, Mr Durden.
Airport parking. Long term.

1359
01:37:28,909 --> 01:37:31,099
After you, Mr Durden.

1360
01:37:31,933 --> 01:37:34,123
After you.

1361
01:37:51,744 --> 01:37:54,454
- Something on your mind, dear?
- No.

1362
01:37:54,455 --> 01:37:57,791
Yeah, why wasn't I told
about Project Mayhem?

1363
01:37:57,792 --> 01:38:00,919
First rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions.

1364
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:03,422
Why didn't you include me in the beginning?

1365
01:38:03,423 --> 01:38:08,635
Fight Club was the beginning. Now it's left
the basements and it's Project Mayhem.

1366
01:38:08,636 --> 01:38:13,119
We started Fight Club together. Remember?
It's as much mine as it is yours.

1367
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:17,394
- Is this about you and me?
- Yeah. Weren't we doing this together?

1368
01:38:17,395 --> 01:38:20,939
This does not belong to us.
We are not special.

1369
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:23,443
Fuck that. You should have told me.

1370
01:38:24,277 --> 01:38:26,258
Hey, Tyler!

1371
01:38:28,135 --> 01:38:30,636
- Goddamn it, Tyler!
- What do you want?!

1372
01:38:30,637 --> 01:38:33,139
A statement of purpose?
Should I e-mail you?

1373
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:35,850
- Oh...
- You decide your level of involvement!

1374
01:38:35,851 --> 01:38:38,665
I will! I wanna know certain things first!

1375
01:38:38,666 --> 01:38:41,377
- The first rule of Project Mayhem...
- Shut up!

1376
01:38:43,046 --> 01:38:46,903
- I wanna know what you're thinking.
- Fuck what you know!

1377
01:38:46,904 --> 01:38:50,448
Forget about what you think you know
about life, friendship,

1378
01:38:50,449 --> 01:38:52,534
and especially about you and me.

1379
01:38:53,681 --> 01:38:55,975
What is that supposed to mean?

1380
01:38:59,312 --> 01:39:01,501
What are you doing?

1381
01:39:02,336 --> 01:39:05,150
What do you wish you'd done
before you died?

1382
01:39:05,151 --> 01:39:08,069
- Paint a self-portrait.
- Build a house.

1383
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:10,572
- And you?
- I don't know. Nothing.

1384
01:39:10,573 --> 01:39:13,074
- Get in the right lane.
- You have to know!

1385
01:39:13,075 --> 01:39:16,203
If you died now,
how would you feel about your life?

1386
01:39:16,204 --> 01:39:19,852
I don't know! Nothing good.
Is that what you want to hear?

1387
01:39:19,853 --> 01:39:22,250
- Come on!
- Not good enough.

1388
01:39:22,251 --> 01:39:24,858
Stop fucking around! Tyler!

1389
01:39:26,005 --> 01:39:28,403
Jesus Christ!

1390
01:39:29,133 --> 01:39:31,219
Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Fuck you!

1391
01:39:31,323 --> 01:39:33,407
Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!

1392
01:39:33,408 --> 01:39:36,223
I am sick of all your shit!

1393
01:39:36,224 --> 01:39:38,205
OK, man.

1394
01:39:39,873 --> 01:39:42,479
- Quit screwing around. Steer!
- Look at you!

1395
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:45,294
- Steer!
- Look at you. You're fucking pathetic!

1396
01:39:45,295 --> 01:39:50,717
- Why? Why? What are you talking about?
- Why do you think I blew up your condo?

1397
01:39:51,134 --> 01:39:52,697
What?

1398
01:39:52,698 --> 01:39:56,660
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.
It's not a goddamned seminar.

1399
01:39:56,661 --> 01:40:00,519
Stop trying to control everything
and just let go!

1400
01:40:02,187 --> 01:40:04,063
Let go!

1401
01:40:04,064 --> 01:40:06,253
All right. Fine.

1402
01:40:06,983 --> 01:40:09,069
Fine.

1403
01:41:07,356 --> 01:41:09,858
I'd never been in a car accident.

1404
01:41:09,859 --> 01:41:13,403
This must have been
what all those people felt like

1405
01:41:13,404 --> 01:41:16,635
before I filed them
as statistics in my reports.

1406
01:41:16,636 --> 01:41:18,826
Goddamn!

1407
01:41:22,267 --> 01:41:25,603
We've just had a near-life experience!

1408
01:41:29,253 --> 01:41:31,337
In the world I see,

1409
01:41:31,338 --> 01:41:35,404
you're stalking elk
through the Grand Canyon forests

1410
01:41:35,405 --> 01:41:38,533
around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.

1411
01:41:40,410 --> 01:41:44,788
You'll wear leather clothes
that will last you the rest of your life.

1412
01:41:44,789 --> 01:41:49,480
You'll climb the thick kudzu vines
that wrap the Sears Tower.

1413
01:41:49,481 --> 01:41:54,068
And when you look down,
you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,

1414
01:41:54,069 --> 01:41:57,718
laying strips of venison
in the empty car-pool lane

1415
01:41:57,719 --> 01:42:00,117
of some abandoned superhighway.

1416
01:42:13,464 --> 01:42:15,758
Feel better, champ.

1417
01:42:33,067 --> 01:42:34,838
And then...

1418
01:42:34,839 --> 01:42:36,507
Tyler?

1419
01:42:36,612 --> 01:42:38,801
..Tyler was gone.

1420
01:42:45,996 --> 01:42:48,186
Was I asleep?

1421
01:42:49,124 --> 01:42:51,210
Had I slept?

1422
01:42:51,314 --> 01:42:54,441
You are not a beautiful, unique snowflake...

1423
01:42:54,442 --> 01:42:56,943
The house had become a living thing.

1424
01:42:56,944 --> 01:43:01,741
Wet inside from so many people
sweating and breathing.

1425
01:43:02,054 --> 01:43:04,765
So many people moving, the house moved.

1426
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:09,664
Planet Tyler.

1427
01:43:09,665 --> 01:43:11,854
I had to hug the walls.

1428
01:43:11,855 --> 01:43:15,087
Trapped inside
this clockwork of space monkeys.

1429
01:43:15,088 --> 01:43:18,945
You shouldn't be smoking in here!
You know how much ether is here!

1430
01:43:18,946 --> 01:43:21,552
Cooking and working and sleeping in teams.

1431
01:43:23,742 --> 01:43:25,827
Hang on a second.

1432
01:43:44,700 --> 01:43:47,516
It's under control, sir.

1433
01:43:49,914 --> 01:43:51,790
Where's Tyler?

1434
01:43:51,791 --> 01:43:54,918
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not...

1435
01:43:54,919 --> 01:43:57,004
Right... OK.

1436
01:43:59,298 --> 01:44:01,488
I'm all alone.

1437
01:44:01,592 --> 01:44:05,241
My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.

1438
01:44:05,242 --> 01:44:07,640
I am Jack's broken heart.

1439
01:44:11,811 --> 01:44:15,773
What comes next in Project Mayhem
only Tyler knows.

1440
01:44:16,503 --> 01:44:19,840
The second rule is you do not ask questions.

1441
01:44:22,446 --> 01:44:25,262
Get the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away!

1442
01:44:25,575 --> 01:44:27,660
Who are all these people?

1443
01:44:32,873 --> 01:44:35,272
The Paper Street Soap Company.

1444
01:44:36,731 --> 01:44:38,817
Can I come in?

1445
01:44:41,945 --> 01:44:44,029
He's not here.

1446
01:44:44,030 --> 01:44:46,429
What?

1447
01:44:47,367 --> 01:44:51,015
Tyler isn't here.

1448
01:44:51,017 --> 01:44:53,206
Tyler went away.

1449
01:44:53,519 --> 01:44:55,604
Tyler's gone.

1450
01:45:12,705 --> 01:45:14,477
Get some help!

1451
01:45:25,426 --> 01:45:30,430
Two gunshot wounds coming through!
Make some fucking room!

1452
01:45:30,431 --> 01:45:32,932
What happened? What happened?

1453
01:45:32,933 --> 01:45:35,957
We were on assignment. We were supposed
to kill two birds with one stone.

1454
01:45:37,208 --> 01:45:39,293
Destroy a piece of corporate art...

1455
01:45:39,294 --> 01:45:41,901
Operation Latte Thunder. Go!

1456
01:45:42,526 --> 01:45:45,759
..and trash a franchise coffee bar.

1457
01:45:52,015 --> 01:45:54,517
We had it all worked out, sir.

1458
01:46:02,650 --> 01:46:05,986
- It went smooth until...
- Police! Freeze!

1459
01:46:05,987 --> 01:46:08,907
- What?
- They shot Bob.

1460
01:46:10,262 --> 01:46:12,765
- They shot him in the head.
- Fucking pigs!

1461
01:46:18,082 --> 01:46:20,167
Oh, God!

1462
01:46:20,168 --> 01:46:23,608
- Those motherfuckers!
- You morons.

1463
01:46:23,609 --> 01:46:27,779
You're running around in ski masks
trying to blow things up?

1464
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:30,595
What did you think was gonna happen?!

1465
01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:36,642
OK, quick! Get rid of the evidence.
We gotta get rid of this body!

1466
01:46:36,643 --> 01:46:39,561
- Bury him.
- What?

1467
01:46:39,562 --> 01:46:41,959
Take him to the garden and bury him.

1468
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:44,879
- Come on, people, let's go!
- Get the fuck off!

1469
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:48,111
Get away from him!
What are you talking about?

1470
01:46:48,112 --> 01:46:50,822
This isn't fucking evidence.
This is a person.

1471
01:46:50,823 --> 01:46:54,159
He's my friend
and you're not burying him in the garden!

1472
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:57,287
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.

1473
01:46:57,288 --> 01:46:59,373
- This is Bob.
- Sir, in...

1474
01:46:59,374 --> 01:47:01,562
In Project Mayhem, we have no names.

1475
01:47:01,563 --> 01:47:03,648
Now, you listen to me.

1476
01:47:03,649 --> 01:47:08,236
This is a man and he has a name,
and it's Robert Paulsen, OK?

1477
01:47:08,237 --> 01:47:10,217
- Robert Paulsen.
- He's a man

1478
01:47:10,218 --> 01:47:13,137
and he's dead now because of us.
Do you understand that?

1479
01:47:13,763 --> 01:47:16,161
I understand.

1480
01:47:18,351 --> 01:47:21,791
In death, a member of Project Mayhem

1481
01:47:21,792 --> 01:47:23,877
has a name.

1482
01:47:23,982 --> 01:47:27,005
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1483
01:47:27,318 --> 01:47:29,508
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1484
01:47:30,133 --> 01:47:32,948
His name... is Robert Paulsen.

1485
01:47:32,949 --> 01:47:36,806
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1486
01:47:36,807 --> 01:47:40,038
Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.

1487
01:47:40,039 --> 01:47:42,749
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1488
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:45,878
Shut up! This is all over with!

1489
01:47:49,006 --> 01:47:51,613
Get the fuck out of here.

1490
01:48:20,288 --> 01:48:24,875
- Tyler?
- No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit.

1491
01:48:24,876 --> 01:48:26,440
I need to see you...

1492
01:48:30,819 --> 01:48:35,093
I went to all the cities
on Tyler's used ticket stubs, barhopping.

1493
01:48:35,094 --> 01:48:39,889
I didn't know how or why, but I could look
at 50 different bars, and somehow I just knew.

1494
01:48:39,891 --> 01:48:44,582
I'm looking for Tyler Durden.
It's very important that I talk to him.

1495
01:48:44,583 --> 01:48:46,250
I wish I could help you,

1496
01:48:46,251 --> 01:48:48,649
sir.

1497
01:48:53,863 --> 01:48:56,052
Every city I went to,

1498
01:48:57,095 --> 01:48:59,598
as soon as I set foot off the plane

1499
01:49:00,015 --> 01:49:02,308
I knew a Fight Club was close.

1500
01:49:02,309 --> 01:49:04,081
Hey! Hey!

1501
01:49:05,124 --> 01:49:06,792
Taxi!

1502
01:49:06,897 --> 01:49:08,981
Look at my face. I'm a member.

1503
01:49:08,982 --> 01:49:11,692
Now, I just need to know if you've seen Tyler.

1504
01:49:11,693 --> 01:49:15,341
I'm not exposed to bespeak
any such information to you

1505
01:49:15,343 --> 01:49:20,243
nor would I, even if I had
said information at this juncture, ... be able.

1506
01:49:20,765 --> 01:49:24,623
- You're a moron.
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1507
01:49:25,874 --> 01:49:31,087
Tyler had been busy...
setting up franchises all over the country.

1508
01:49:33,694 --> 01:49:38,177
Was I asleep? Had I slept?

1509
01:49:38,178 --> 01:49:40,576
Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?

1510
01:49:41,827 --> 01:49:44,954
- We've just heard the stories.
- What kind of stories?

1511
01:49:44,955 --> 01:49:49,229
- Nobody knows what he looks like.
- He has plastic surgery every three years.

1512
01:49:49,230 --> 01:49:52,462
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

1513
01:49:52,463 --> 01:49:56,633
- Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?
- Is Mr Durden building an army?

1514
01:49:56,634 --> 01:49:59,762
I was living in a state of perpetual de'ja vu.

1515
01:50:00,492 --> 01:50:02,577
Everywhere I went,

1516
01:50:02,681 --> 01:50:04,661
I felt I'd already been there.

1517
01:50:04,663 --> 01:50:07,686
It was like following an invisible man.

1518
01:50:08,625 --> 01:50:10,813
The smell of dried blood,

1519
01:50:10,815 --> 01:50:14,464
dirty, bare footprints circling each other.

1520
01:50:15,194 --> 01:50:18,425
That aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken.

1521
01:50:18,426 --> 01:50:22,180
The feel of a floor still warm
from a fight the night before.

1522
01:50:22,910 --> 01:50:25,934
I was always just one step behind Tyler.

1523
01:50:28,749 --> 01:50:31,981
His name is Robert Paulsen...

1524
01:50:36,569 --> 01:50:38,655
Welcome back, sir.

1525
01:50:39,593 --> 01:50:41,782
How have you been?

1526
01:50:41,783 --> 01:50:43,972
Do you know me?

1527
01:50:43,973 --> 01:50:46,474
Is this a test, sir?

1528
01:50:46,475 --> 01:50:48,455
No. This is not a test.

1529
01:50:48,456 --> 01:50:50,750
You were in here last Thursday.

1530
01:50:51,272 --> 01:50:53,669
Thursday?

1531
01:50:53,670 --> 01:50:57,736
You were standing where you are now,
asking how good security is.

1532
01:50:58,258 --> 01:51:00,447
It's tight as a drum, sir.

1533
01:51:02,950 --> 01:51:05,243
Who do you think I am?

1534
01:51:05,244 --> 01:51:07,851
Are you sure this isn't a test?

1535
01:51:07,955 --> 01:51:09,935
No, this is not a test.

1536
01:51:09,936 --> 01:51:12,021
You're Mr Durden.

1537
01:51:13,377 --> 01:51:16,087
You're the one who gave me this.

1538
01:51:16,088 --> 01:51:20,467
Please return your seat backs
to their full upright and locked position.

1539
01:51:31,729 --> 01:51:33,813
- Yeah?
- Marla, it's me.

1540
01:51:33,814 --> 01:51:35,898
- Have we ever done it?
- Done what?

1541
01:51:35,899 --> 01:51:37,255
Had sex?

1542
01:51:37,359 --> 01:51:39,652
What kind of stupid question is that?

1543
01:51:39,653 --> 01:51:42,050
Stupid because it's yes
or because it's no?

1544
01:51:42,051 --> 01:51:44,761
- Is this a trick?
- No. I need to know...

1545
01:51:44,762 --> 01:51:48,724
You wanna know if I think
we were just having sex or making love?

1546
01:51:48,725 --> 01:51:52,269
- We did make love?
- Is that what you're calling it?

1547
01:51:52,270 --> 01:51:55,188
Just answer the question!
Did we do it or not?!

1548
01:51:55,189 --> 01:51:58,108
You fuck me, then snub me.
You love me, you hate me.

1549
01:51:58,109 --> 01:52:01,028
You're sensitive,
then you turn into an asshole.

1550
01:52:01,029 --> 01:52:03,843
Does that describe our relationship, Tyler?

1551
01:52:03,844 --> 01:52:06,032
We just lost cabin pressure.

1552
01:52:06,034 --> 01:52:07,492
What did you just say?

1553
01:52:07,493 --> 01:52:09,995
- What is wrong with you?
- Say my name!

1554
01:52:09,996 --> 01:52:13,749
Tyler Durden!
You fucking freak! What's going on?

1555
01:52:13,750 --> 01:52:15,938
- I'm coming over!
- I'm not there!

1556
01:52:15,939 --> 01:52:18,858
You broke your promise.

1557
01:52:18,859 --> 01:52:20,839
Jesus, Tyler.

1558
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:24,488
- You fucking talked to her about me.
- What the fuck is going on?

1559
01:52:24,489 --> 01:52:27,929
I asked you for one thing. One simple thing.

1560
01:52:27,930 --> 01:52:30,329
Why do people think that I'm you?

1561
01:52:30,850 --> 01:52:33,040
Answer me!

1562
01:52:35,229 --> 01:52:37,210
Sit.

1563
01:52:39,921 --> 01:52:42,736
Answer me. Why do people think I'm you?

1564
01:52:42,737 --> 01:52:44,926
I think you know.

1565
01:52:45,031 --> 01:52:47,636
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

1566
01:52:47,638 --> 01:52:50,556
Why would anyone
possibly confuse you with me?

1567
01:52:50,557 --> 01:52:53,477
I... I don't know.

1568
01:52:58,065 --> 01:53:01,087
- You got it.
- No.

1569
01:53:01,088 --> 01:53:03,278
- Do not fuck with us!
- Say it.

1570
01:53:04,529 --> 01:53:06,615
Because...

1571
01:53:07,970 --> 01:53:09,117
Say it!

1572
01:53:10,786 --> 01:53:12,870
Because we're the same person.

1573
01:53:12,871 --> 01:53:15,060
That's right.

1574
01:53:15,061 --> 01:53:17,354
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap.

1575
01:53:17,355 --> 01:53:21,107
- I don't understand this.
- You wanted a way to change your life.

1576
01:53:21,108 --> 01:53:23,297
You could not do this on your own.

1577
01:53:23,298 --> 01:53:25,383
All the ways you wish you could be,

1578
01:53:25,488 --> 01:53:27,468
that's me.

1579
01:53:27,469 --> 01:53:30,596
I look like you wanna look,
I fuck like you wanna fuck.

1580
01:53:30,597 --> 01:53:33,098
I am smart, capable and, most importantly,

1581
01:53:33,099 --> 01:53:35,914
I'm free in all the ways that you are not.

1582
01:53:35,915 --> 01:53:36,958
Oh, no.

1583
01:53:37,062 --> 01:53:40,085
- Tyler's not here. Tyler went away.
- What?

1584
01:53:40,086 --> 01:53:42,483
This isn't possible. This is crazy.

1585
01:53:42,484 --> 01:53:44,568
People do it every day.

1586
01:53:44,569 --> 01:53:48,113
They talk to themselves.
They see themselves as they'd like to be.

1587
01:53:48,114 --> 01:53:51,555
They don't have the courage you have
to just run with it.

1588
01:53:55,205 --> 01:53:58,749
You still wrestle with it,
so sometimes you're still you.

1589
01:53:58,750 --> 01:54:03,545
- We should do this again sometime.
- At times, you imagine you're watching me.

1590
01:54:03,547 --> 01:54:06,049
If this is your first time, you have to fight.

1591
01:54:06,153 --> 01:54:10,637
Little by little,
you're just letting yourself become

1592
01:54:11,367 --> 01:54:13,347
Tyler Durden.

1593
01:54:13,348 --> 01:54:16,162
You are not your job
or how much money you have!

1594
01:54:16,163 --> 01:54:18,665
- No. You have a house.
- Rented in your name.

1595
01:54:18,666 --> 01:54:22,314
- You have jobs, a life.
- You work nights because you can't sleep.

1596
01:54:22,315 --> 01:54:24,191
Or you stay up and make soap.

1597
01:54:24,192 --> 01:54:29,406
- You're fucking Marla, Tyler.
- Technically, you are. It's all the same to her.

1598
01:54:30,970 --> 01:54:33,055
Oh, my God.

1599
01:54:33,994 --> 01:54:36,079
Now you see our dilemma.

1600
01:54:36,183 --> 01:54:38,580
She knows too much.

1601
01:54:38,581 --> 01:54:43,690
I think we're gonna have to talk about
how this might compromise our goals.

1602
01:54:43,691 --> 01:54:45,985
What... What are you saying?

1603
01:54:46,819 --> 01:54:51,093
This is bullshit. This is bullshit,
I'm not listening to this!

1604
01:54:51,094 --> 01:54:53,908
- You are insane!
- No. You're insane.

1605
01:54:53,909 --> 01:54:56,725
We simply do not have time for this crap.

1606
01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:00,374
It's called a changeover.

1607
01:55:00,478 --> 01:55:02,667
The movie goes on

1608
01:55:02,668 --> 01:55:05,900
and nobody in the audience has any idea.

1609
01:55:18,621 --> 01:55:22,478
- Sir! Are you checking out?
- Yeah. Bill me.

1610
01:55:22,479 --> 01:55:24,982
Can you initial this list of phone calls?

1611
01:55:29,257 --> 01:55:33,532
- When were these made?
- Between 2.00 and 3.30 this morning.

1612
01:55:39,267 --> 01:55:43,437
Have I been going to bed earlier every night?
Have I been sleeping later?

1613
01:55:43,438 --> 01:55:48,443
Have I been Tyler longer and longer?

1614
01:55:50,737 --> 01:55:53,343
Is any body here?

1615
01:55:55,846 --> 01:55:58,036
De'ja vu all over again.

1616
01:55:59,600 --> 01:56:02,206
With enough soap,
one could blow up anything.

1617
01:56:04,396 --> 01:56:06,586
Oh, my God.

1618
01:56:10,444 --> 01:56:12,946
- 1888.
- Who am I calling?

1619
01:56:13,259 --> 01:56:17,117
1888 Franklin. This is maintenance. Hello?

1620
01:56:18,056 --> 01:56:19,723
Hello?

1621
01:56:19,724 --> 01:56:21,913
1888 Franklin Street?

1622
01:56:21,914 --> 01:56:24,103
Yes. Can I help you?

1623
01:56:26,397 --> 01:56:29,107
- Hello?
- Yeah, yeah.

1624
01:56:29,108 --> 01:56:31,714
I need to talk to your supervisor right away.

1625
01:56:31,715 --> 01:56:33,904
- Speaking.
- OK, listen to me.

1626
01:56:33,905 --> 01:56:37,240
Something terrible
is about to happen to your building.

1627
01:56:37,241 --> 01:56:39,327
It's under control, sir.

1628
01:56:39,744 --> 01:56:43,393
- Excuse me?
- Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.

1629
01:56:47,564 --> 01:56:49,024
2160.

1630
01:56:56,531 --> 01:56:59,138
Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!

1631
01:57:00,702 --> 01:57:03,517
Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!

1632
01:57:03,518 --> 01:57:07,792
Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom!
They almost broke my arm!

1633
01:57:07,793 --> 01:57:10,607
They were burning their fingertips with lye.

1634
01:57:10,608 --> 01:57:14,674
This needs a tremendous act of faith
on your part, but hear me out.

1635
01:57:14,675 --> 01:57:18,741
- Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
- A little more faith than that.

1636
01:57:21,973 --> 01:57:24,475
I don't wanna hear
anything you have to say.

1637
01:57:24,476 --> 01:57:26,770
You have every right to be...

1638
01:57:27,291 --> 01:57:29,168
I'll just have a coffee, thanks.

1639
01:57:29,272 --> 01:57:32,295
Sir. Anything you order is free of charge, sir.

1640
01:57:32,296 --> 01:57:34,381
Why is it free of charge?

1641
01:57:34,382 --> 01:57:36,467
- Don't ask.
- Whatever.

1642
01:57:36,571 --> 01:57:42,097
I'll have the clam chowder, fried chicken
and baked potato and a chocolate chiffon pie.

1643
01:57:42,098 --> 01:57:44,286
Clean food, please.

1644
01:57:44,287 --> 01:57:47,414
In that case,
may I advise against the clam chowder.

1645
01:57:47,416 --> 01:57:49,605
No clam chowder. Thank you.

1646
01:57:51,065 --> 01:57:53,359
You got about 30 seconds.

1647
01:57:55,966 --> 01:57:58,571
I know I've been acting very strange, OK?

1648
01:57:58,572 --> 01:58:02,012
- I know it seems there's two sides to me...
- Two sides?

1649
01:58:02,013 --> 01:58:07,122
- You're Dr Jekyll and Mr Jackass.
- I know. But I realized something important.

1650
01:58:07,123 --> 01:58:11,292
- What?
- The nature of our relationship wasn't clear

1651
01:58:11,293 --> 01:58:13,691
to me for reasons I won't go into.

1652
01:58:13,692 --> 01:58:16,402
- I know I haven't treated you well.
- Whatever.

1653
01:58:16,403 --> 01:58:19,217
No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!

1654
01:58:19,218 --> 01:58:21,615
Fifteen seconds,
don't open your mouth.

1655
01:58:21,616 --> 01:58:23,805
I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.

1656
01:58:23,806 --> 01:58:28,184
What I've come to realize
is that I really like you, Marla.

1657
01:58:28,185 --> 01:58:30,374
You do?

1658
01:58:30,375 --> 01:58:32,252
I really do.

1659
01:58:32,356 --> 01:58:36,734
I care about you and I don't want anything
bad to happen to you because of me.

1660
01:58:36,736 --> 01:58:39,654
Marla, your life is in danger.

1661
01:58:39,655 --> 01:58:41,635
What?

1662
01:58:41,636 --> 01:58:45,389
You need to leave town for a while.
Get out of any major city.

1663
01:58:45,390 --> 01:58:48,204
- Just go camping...
- You're an insane person.

1664
01:58:48,205 --> 01:58:51,854
- No. I've involved you in something terrible.
- No. Shut up!

1665
01:58:51,855 --> 01:58:54,462
- You're not safe.
- Shut up!

1666
01:58:56,234 --> 01:59:00,717
- Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.
- I know you did.

1667
01:59:00,718 --> 01:59:03,845
There are things about you I like.
You're smart, funny.

1668
01:59:03,846 --> 01:59:05,826
You're spectacular in bed.

1669
01:59:05,827 --> 01:59:07,390
But

1670
01:59:07,391 --> 01:59:09,475
you're intolerable.

1671
01:59:09,477 --> 01:59:12,082
You have very serious emotional problems.

1672
01:59:12,083 --> 01:59:16,253
Deep-seated problems
for which you should seek professional help.

1673
01:59:16,254 --> 01:59:20,321
- I know, and I'm sorry.
- You're sorry, I'm sorry. Everyone's sorry.

1674
01:59:21,363 --> 01:59:23,448
I can't do this any more.

1675
01:59:23,449 --> 01:59:25,637
I can't.

1676
01:59:25,638 --> 01:59:27,827
And I won't.

1677
01:59:27,828 --> 01:59:29,913
I'm gone.

1678
01:59:29,914 --> 01:59:32,729
You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!

1679
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:38,254
- Marla, you don't understand!
- Leave me alone!

1680
01:59:38,255 --> 01:59:40,861
- Marla, I am trying to protect you!
- Let go!

1681
01:59:40,862 --> 01:59:43,885
- I don't ever wanna see you again!
- That's fine...

1682
01:59:43,886 --> 01:59:46,075
Here, wait right here!

1683
01:59:49,934 --> 01:59:52,539
Hold it right there! Shut up!

1684
01:59:52,540 --> 01:59:54,729
Take this money and get on this bus.

1685
01:59:54,730 --> 01:59:57,023
I promise I won't bother you again.

1686
01:59:57,024 --> 01:59:58,483
Shut up!

1687
01:59:58,484 --> 02:00:01,820
Please get on the bus. Please get on the bus.

1688
02:00:02,863 --> 02:00:05,053
Why are you doing this?

1689
02:00:05,157 --> 02:00:09,327
They think you're a threat.
I can't explain it now, just trust me!

1690
02:00:09,328 --> 02:00:13,706
- If I know where you are, you won't be safe.
- I'll keep this, it's asshole tax.

1691
02:00:13,707 --> 02:00:18,295
- Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities.
- Tyler.

1692
02:00:19,651 --> 02:00:22,674
You're the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

1693
02:00:37,481 --> 02:00:40,192
Hello. I need you to arrest me.

1694
02:00:40,296 --> 02:00:43,110
I am the leader of a terrorist organization

1695
02:00:43,112 --> 02:00:48,115
responsible for numerous acts
of vandalism and assault all over this city.

1696
02:00:48,117 --> 02:00:52,078
In the metropolitan area,
we had probably 200 members.

1697
02:00:52,079 --> 02:00:56,041
Chapters have sprung up
in five or six other major cities already.

1698
02:00:56,145 --> 02:00:59,168
This is a tightly-regimented organization

1699
02:00:59,169 --> 02:01:04,903
with many cells capable of operating
independent of central leadership.

1700
02:01:04,904 --> 02:01:08,865
Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street.

1701
02:01:08,866 --> 02:01:10,847
That's our headquarters.

1702
02:01:10,952 --> 02:01:13,557
In the back, buried in the garden,

1703
02:01:13,559 --> 02:01:16,686
you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.

1704
02:01:16,687 --> 02:01:20,127
In the basement,
you're gonna find some bathtubs

1705
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:25,549
that have been used very recently
to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.

1706
02:01:25,550 --> 02:01:27,634
I believe the plan is to blow up

1707
02:01:27,635 --> 02:01:30,762
the headquarters
of these credit card companies

1708
02:01:30,763 --> 02:01:32,953
and the TRW building.

1709
02:01:33,787 --> 02:01:37,331
Why these buildings?
Why credit card companies?

1710
02:01:37,332 --> 02:01:41,086
If you erase the debt record,
then we all go back to zero.

1711
02:01:41,712 --> 02:01:43,901
You'll create total chaos.

1712
02:01:45,361 --> 02:01:48,698
Keep him talking. I need to make a phone
call.

1713
02:01:59,229 --> 02:02:01,523
I really admire what you're doing.

1714
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:04,129
What?

1715
02:02:04,130 --> 02:02:06,214
You're a brave man to order this.

1716
02:02:06,215 --> 02:02:08,091
You're a genius, sir.

1717
02:02:08,092 --> 02:02:12,887
You said if anyone ever interferes
with Project Mayhem, even you,

1718
02:02:12,889 --> 02:02:15,287
we gotta get his balls.

1719
02:02:16,747 --> 02:02:19,874
- Don't fight.
- It's a powerful gesture, Mr Durden.

1720
02:02:19,875 --> 02:02:23,002
- It will set an example.
- You're making a big mistake!

1721
02:02:23,003 --> 02:02:26,026
- You said you'd say that.
- I'm not Tyler Durden!

1722
02:02:26,027 --> 02:02:29,884
- You told us you'd say that too.
- All right. I am Tyler Durden.

1723
02:02:29,885 --> 02:02:32,699
Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct order.

1724
02:02:32,700 --> 02:02:37,079
- We're aborting this mission now.
- You said you would definitely say that.

1725
02:02:43,023 --> 02:02:46,776
Are you fucking out of your minds?
You're police officers!

1726
02:02:47,402 --> 02:02:49,592
Is somebody timing this?

1727
02:02:49,696 --> 02:02:52,719
Keep your mouth shut.

1728
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:54,910
Shit!

1729
02:02:57,412 --> 02:03:00,331
Some of this information checks out.

1730
02:03:00,332 --> 02:03:03,773
- Let's go to that house on Paper Street.
- Be right there.

1731
02:03:04,294 --> 02:03:06,171
Hey, wait!

1732
02:03:06,796 --> 02:03:09,402
- I got him.
- Sir, we have to do this.

1733
02:03:09,403 --> 02:03:12,009
- Stop fighting!
- Where's the rubber band?

1734
02:03:12,010 --> 02:03:14,617
Get away from me! Drop that fucking knife!

1735
02:03:17,953 --> 02:03:21,499
Back up. Face down on the floor right now!

1736
02:03:22,750 --> 02:03:24,835
Get down on the floor!

1737
02:03:29,527 --> 02:03:32,550
The first person
that comes out of this door

1738
02:03:32,551 --> 02:03:34,532
gets a lead salad! Understand?

1739
02:03:58,827 --> 02:04:01,434
Get away! Stay away!

1740
02:04:14,260 --> 02:04:16,449
I ran.

1741
02:04:16,866 --> 02:04:21,246
I ran until my muscles burned
and my veins pumped battery acid.

1742
02:04:23,748 --> 02:04:25,938
Then I ran some more.

1743
02:05:06,499 --> 02:05:08,896
What the fuck are you doing?

1744
02:05:08,897 --> 02:05:11,920
Running around in your underpants!
You look crazy!

1745
02:05:11,921 --> 02:05:15,048
No. I'm onto you.
L know what's going on here.

1746
02:05:15,049 --> 02:05:20,159
Come on, then. I got us a great place
to watch from. It'll be like pay-per-view.

1747
02:06:08,019 --> 02:06:10,833
- Oh, Christ.
- Now what are you doing?

1748
02:06:10,834 --> 02:06:14,170
- I'm stopping this.
- Why?

1749
02:06:14,171 --> 02:06:17,715
- The greatest thing you've ever done.
- I can't let this happen.

1750
02:06:17,716 --> 02:06:20,947
There are 10 other bombs
in 10 other buildings.

1751
02:06:20,948 --> 02:06:23,450
Since when is Project Mayhem
about murder?

1752
02:06:23,451 --> 02:06:25,536
The buildings are empty.

1753
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:28,455
We're not killing anyone.
We're setting 'em free!

1754
02:06:28,456 --> 02:06:31,271
Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.

1755
02:06:31,375 --> 02:06:34,815
You wanna make an omelet,
you gotta break some eggs.

1756
02:06:34,816 --> 02:06:38,570
No. I'm not listening to you.
You're not even there.

1757
02:06:44,513 --> 02:06:48,892
I wouldn't do that.
Not unless you knew which wires were what.

1758
02:06:48,893 --> 02:06:50,665
If you know, I know.

1759
02:06:56,192 --> 02:07:00,780
Or maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent
all day thinking about the wrong ones.

1760
02:07:09,121 --> 02:07:10,268
You think?

1761
02:07:12,145 --> 02:07:14,335
Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.

1762
02:07:15,065 --> 02:07:18,193
Pull any one but the green one.

1763
02:07:22,885 --> 02:07:25,596
I asked you not to do that!

1764
02:07:27,369 --> 02:07:28,933
Fuck!

1765
02:07:29,871 --> 02:07:32,061
Tyler, get away from the van.

1766
02:07:34,146 --> 02:07:37,690
Tyler, I'm not kidding!
Get away from the van!

1767
02:07:37,691 --> 02:07:39,047
Goddamn it!

1768
02:07:45,408 --> 02:07:46,762
OK.

1769
02:07:46,763 --> 02:07:50,307
You are now firing a gun
at your imaginary friend

1770
02:07:50,308 --> 02:07:53,019
near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!

1771
02:07:55,105 --> 02:07:56,982
Cool it, Tyler!

1772
02:08:10,120 --> 02:08:12,204
Come on!

1773
02:08:12,205 --> 02:08:14,395
Don't go!

1774
02:08:51,828 --> 02:08:53,079
What?!

1775
02:09:38,437 --> 02:09:39,167
Three minutes.

1776
02:09:40,209 --> 02:09:42,607
This is it.

1777
02:09:42,608 --> 02:09:44,692
The beginning.

1778
02:09:44,693 --> 02:09:46,673
Ground zero.

1779
02:09:46,674 --> 02:09:49,071
I think this is about where we came in.

1780
02:09:49,072 --> 02:09:51,574
Do you have a speech for the occasion?

1781
02:09:53,975 --> 02:09:54,806
I'm sorry?

1782
02:09:54,807 --> 02:09:56,893
I still can't think of anything.

1783
02:09:58,874 --> 02:10:01,064
Flashback humor.

1784
02:10:06,069 --> 02:10:08,154
It's getting exciting now.

1785
02:10:09,718 --> 02:10:11,490
Two and a half.

1786
02:10:11,491 --> 02:10:14,201
Think of everything we've accomplished.

1787
02:10:14,202 --> 02:10:19,101
Out these windows, we will view
the collapse of financial history.

1788
02:10:19,102 --> 02:10:22,960
One step closer to economic equilibrium.

1789
02:10:36,411 --> 02:10:38,913
Why is she here?

1790
02:10:38,914 --> 02:10:40,894
Tying up loose ends.

1791
02:10:40,895 --> 02:10:44,022
Put me down, you bald-headed fuck!

1792
02:10:44,023 --> 02:10:47,150
- I beg you, please don't do this.
- I'm not doing this.

1793
02:10:47,151 --> 02:10:50,800
- We are doing this. This is what we want.
- No.

1794
02:10:50,801 --> 02:10:55,596
- I don't want this.
- Right. Except you is meaningless now.

1795
02:10:55,597 --> 02:10:59,663
- We have to forget about you.
- You're a voice in my head.

1796
02:10:59,664 --> 02:11:01,748
You're a voice in mine!

1797
02:11:01,749 --> 02:11:04,668
- Why can't I get rid of you?
- You need me.

1798
02:11:04,669 --> 02:11:06,857
No. I don't. I really don't any more.

1799
02:11:06,858 --> 02:11:11,237
You created me. I didn't create some
loser alter ego to make me feel better.

1800
02:11:11,238 --> 02:11:15,304
- Take some responsibility.
- I do. I am responsible for all of it

1801
02:11:15,409 --> 02:11:17,180
and I accept that.

1802
02:11:17,181 --> 02:11:21,352
So, please, I'm begging you,
please call this off.

1803
02:11:23,125 --> 02:11:25,419
Have I ever let us down?

1804
02:11:26,878 --> 02:11:29,277
How far have you come because of me?!

1805
02:11:35,116 --> 02:11:37,200
I will bring us through this.

1806
02:11:37,201 --> 02:11:41,058
As always, I will carry you
kicking and screaming

1807
02:11:41,059 --> 02:11:43,562
and in the end you will thank me.

1808
02:11:43,979 --> 02:11:46,584
Tyler. Tyler.

1809
02:11:46,585 --> 02:11:50,130
I'm grateful to you.
For everything that you've done for me.

1810
02:11:50,131 --> 02:11:52,945
But this is too much. I don't want this.

1811
02:11:52,946 --> 02:11:58,367
What do you want? Your shit job back?
Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?

1812
02:11:58,368 --> 02:12:00,453
Fuck you! I won't do it.

1813
02:12:01,288 --> 02:12:05,145
- This can't be happening.
- It's already done, so shut up!

1814
02:12:05,146 --> 02:12:06,814
60 seconds till CRI.

1815
02:12:07,335 --> 02:12:09,421
No.

1816
02:12:11,298 --> 02:12:14,216
I can figure this out. This isn't even real.

1817
02:12:14,217 --> 02:12:18,075
You're not real, that gun...
That gun isn't even in your hand.

1818
02:12:19,326 --> 02:12:21,412
The gun's in my hand.

1819
02:12:26,521 --> 02:12:29,128
Good for you. It doesn't change a thing.

1820
02:12:37,782 --> 02:12:40,597
Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?

1821
02:12:40,598 --> 02:12:42,787
Not my head, Tyler.

1822
02:12:43,204 --> 02:12:45,394
Our head.

1823
02:12:46,750 --> 02:12:48,939
Interesting.

1824
02:12:51,859 --> 02:12:54,570
Where are you going with this, Ikea boy?

1825
02:13:00,930 --> 02:13:04,059
Hey. It's you and me.

1826
02:13:06,770 --> 02:13:08,855
Friends?

1827
02:13:09,689 --> 02:13:11,879
Tyler,

1828
02:13:15,215 --> 02:13:17,613
I want you to really listen to me.

1829
02:13:17,614 --> 02:13:20,115
OK.

1830
02:13:20,116 --> 02:13:22,202
My eyes are open.

1831
02:13:40,970 --> 02:13:43,056
What's that smell?

1832
02:14:02,659 --> 02:14:05,682
- Where is everybody?
- Oh, no. What's going on?

1833
02:14:06,308 --> 02:14:07,976
Mr Durden!

1834
02:14:08,915 --> 02:14:10,792
Oh, my God!

1835
02:14:16,214 --> 02:14:19,445
Are you... Are you all right, sir?

1836
02:14:19,446 --> 02:14:23,512
- Oh, yeah, I'm OK.
- You look terrible, sir. What happened?

1837
02:14:23,513 --> 02:14:27,578
- Nothing, it's no problem.
- No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.

1838
02:14:27,579 --> 02:14:30,395
- You look awful. You need assistance.
- I'm fine.

1839
02:14:30,499 --> 02:14:34,253
Look, I'm fine... Everything's fine.

1840
02:14:36,338 --> 02:14:38,631
Stop it!

1841
02:14:38,632 --> 02:14:41,863
- Let her go.
- Christ Almighty!

1842
02:14:41,864 --> 02:14:43,740
You!

1843
02:14:43,741 --> 02:14:45,931
Hi, Marla.

1844
02:14:46,348 --> 02:14:51,248
- Leave her with me. Meet me downstairs.
- Are you sure?

1845
02:14:51,249 --> 02:14:53,438
Yes, I'm sure.

1846
02:14:54,481 --> 02:14:58,651
You fucker! What kind of sick
fucking game are you playing at?!

1847
02:14:58,652 --> 02:15:01,466
Putting me on a... Oh, my God, your face!

1848
02:15:01,467 --> 02:15:03,031
Yeah, l know.

1849
02:15:07,723 --> 02:15:09,600
What happened?

1850
02:15:09,809 --> 02:15:11,998
- Don't ask.
- You're shot.

1851
02:15:11,999 --> 02:15:14,084
- Yes, I'm shot.
- Oh, my God.

1852
02:15:14,918 --> 02:15:18,046
- I can't believe he's standing.
- One tough motherfucker.

1853
02:15:21,800 --> 02:15:23,677
Who did this?

1854
02:15:23,781 --> 02:15:26,283
I did, actually.

1855
02:15:26,284 --> 02:15:28,473
Find some gauze.

1856
02:15:29,725 --> 02:15:31,809
You shot yourself?

1857
02:15:31,810 --> 02:15:34,520
Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me.

1858
02:15:34,521 --> 02:15:36,918
I'm really OK.

1859
02:15:36,919 --> 02:15:40,986
Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine.

1860
02:15:53,811 --> 02:15:57,773
You met me at a very strange time in my life.
