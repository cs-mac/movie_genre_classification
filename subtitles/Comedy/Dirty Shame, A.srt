1
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:43,562
Hey, it's me.

2
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,764
Pick up.

3
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,134
Pick up.

4
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,662
- Hi.
- Hi.

5
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,666
Come in.

6
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,635
Drink?

7
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,235
No, thank you.

8
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:43,951
Perfect.

9
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,519
This way.

10
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,827
Slowly.

11
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,481
Hey, it's me.

12
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:56,960
Pick up.

13
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,664
Pick up.

14
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,497
Brandon?

15
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:13,310
Brandon?

16
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,675
Brandon, where are you?

17
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:26,014
Brandon? Brandon?

18
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:32,658
Brandon?

19
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,199
Ugh!

20
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,039
This is me calling you.

21
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,544
Fuck!

22
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,211
"I find you disgusting.

23
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:20,686
"I find you inconsolable.
I find you invasive."

24
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,287
This is what the cynics used to say.

25
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:29,192
Companies would refuse
to look into the future.

26
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:33,103
They would say, "Can we stop this virus?"

27
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,868
As if it was a negative progression.

28
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,668
But it's growing.

29
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:45,342
More and more,
with a momentum that is unstoppable.

30
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,248
Now some kid snorts the entire load
of his mother's spice cupboard.

31
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,050
Post that on You Tube.

32
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,783
They would watch
as it becomes the buzz word

33
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,722
amongst high school students everywhere.

34
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:57,125
Eventually, the cynicism
is turning into awe.

35
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:23,379
Do you know what's going on
with my computer?

36
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,952
They took it.

37
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,861
Yeah, I know. Someone could have told me.

38
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,026
Some kind of virus.

39
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:35,891
Cool.

40
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,243
Thank you.

41
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,638
Okay, me again.

42
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:31,940
I'm dying. I have cancer.
I have one week to live.

43
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,215
The very worst kind of cancer.

44
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,983
Of the vulva...

45
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,923
- Hey.
- Hey.

46
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,392
You're such a dick.

47
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,560
What are you doing, man?

48
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,334
All right, gentlemen.
If you just please make yourselves at home.

49
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,309
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

50
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:54,290
It falls upon me as your
beloved boss to propose a toast.

51
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,424
To success.

52
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:59,260
I just hope my wife appreciates it.

53
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,965
Get a new tie, please.

54
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,802
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh, my goodness.

55
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,436
I love women in suits.
I love women in suits.

56
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,910
We could talk business,
I would rearrange my life.

57
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,450
- Wow, she's beautiful.
- Gray suit?

58
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,782
- I'm gonna go talk to her. Count me down.
- You should go talk to her.

59
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,515
Yeah, you should.

60
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,216
Five, four, three, two, one.

61
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,780
Boom.

62
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,417
Have fun.

63
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,122
Twenty bucks says he fucks it up.

64
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,299
Incoming.

65
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,668
Hi, excuse me. Listen, I don't want to
beat around the bush.

66
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,707
I think you're absolutely gorgeous.
My name's David.

67
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:38,607
- Hi, David. Elizabeth. Nice to meet you.
- Elizabeth. That's a beautiful name.

68
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,167
- Hi, I'm David. I don't mean to be rude.
- Loren.

69
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,441
- Hi, how are you? David. Nice to meet you.
- Rachel.

70
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,982
Listen, can I buy you a drink?
Can I buy you all drinks?

71
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,347
- Sure. Why not?
- I would love that.

72
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,147
That would be my pleasure.
What are you guys drinking?

73
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,085
- Well, we were thinking shots.
- You were thinking shots?

74
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,419
We just did shots of tequila.
Would you guys like a shot of tequila?

75
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:53,786
- Bring it on.
- Love it.

76
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,021
Excuse me. Bartender? Can we get
four shots of your finest tequila?

77
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,120
Thank you very much.

78
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,291
I can see you're very successful.

79
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,393
I think part of the secret to my success
is attention to detail.

80
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,495
- Detail?
- Play the game.

81
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,836
- What game?
- Okay. Blue or green?

82
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:13,504
I like games. I like this game.
Blue. Green. Green, it's green.

83
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,240
- That's brown.
- Wow, wow!

84
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,838
I don't know how you change
the color of your eyes like that.

85
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,111
How do you do that so quickly?
That's amazing. That's a real talent.

86
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,811
- Detail man.
- Hey, buddy.

87
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,787
This guy, right here,
fucking nailed it today.

88
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,416
I want you to know you fucking nailed it.
You're the man.

89
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,858
Your pitch, amazing.
Listen, we're playing a game here.

90
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,259
Close your eyes again. Blue or green?

91
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,255
- Brown.
- Fuck off.

92
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,425
All right. You, Loren, close your eyes.

93
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,462
- Blue.
- Blue.

94
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:38,560
- You're just making that up.
- See? He's good.

95
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,366
He's just picking colors randomly.

96
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,533
- You can have his shot.
- Excuse me. We need another shot, please.

97
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:49,576
- You can put these on me.
- No, I told you, I had it.

98
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:50,672
No, I have it.

99
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,216
- I'll get the next round.
- Sure.

100
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,047
You're a strong, independent woman.
I like that.

101
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,952
Thank you. Cheers. To nailing it...

102
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,046
- To nailing it.
- To nailing it.

103
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,147
- To nailing it.
- ...and to success.

104
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,213
Yes.

105
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:03,452
Mmm!

106
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,826
I love that.

107
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,824
Oh, fuck.

108
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,292
Whoa!

109
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,057
So what do you girls do for fun?

110
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,659
Fun? Karate.

111
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,504
You hear this song?
I love this song, I wrote this song,

112
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,840
I would love it if you would dance with me
to this song that I wrote for you.

113
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,472
Come on. Let's go on the dance floor.
One song.

114
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,482
Yeah, come on. You're a fun girl.
It'll be fun.

115
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,179
I'll bring her back. Swear to God.
Come on, come on, it's fun.

116
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:33,788
Toe to toe
Dancing very close

117
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,754
Spinning, spinning, spinning...

118
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:36,987
Whoo!

119
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:40,657
I'm grabbing her purse 'cause she's
gonna get robbed and roofed.

120
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,166
- Dance?
- No.

121
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,259
- Are you sure? Okay.
- I'm sure.

122
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:49,270
Wall to wall

123
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:53,710
People hypnotized

124
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:59,342
And they're stepping lightly

125
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:03,821
Hang each night in

126
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:07,052
Rapture

127
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:11,322
Okay, okay, okay! Hold on.
I just gotta talk to you one more time.

128
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,887
Listen, your eyes, they're beautiful.

129
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,262
You know why
I didn't get it right the first time?

130
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,460
Because it's like a collage.
Let me see them again.

131
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,264
Look at those eyes.
I know the color of your eyes!

132
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,498
- David! Come on!
- Come on, we love that game.

133
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,005
That's so much fun.

134
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,769
It's okay, 'cause I'm going this way.

135
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,538
Hey, man, he's going uptown.

136
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,151
Come on.

137
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,825
- Okay.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

138
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,607
Hey. Want a ride?

139
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,308
Sure.

140
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,314
I want your love
I want your love

141
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:53,454
I want your love
I want...

142
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,083
I'll fucking kill you!

143
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,095
What the fuck?

144
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,258
- Ow! Fuck!
- Jesus Christ, Sissy!

145
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,961
Fuck! Brandon, don't you fucking knock?

146
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,936
What the fuck?
Why would I knock? I live here!

147
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,232
Oh, fuck!

148
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:10,104
- How'd you get in?
- You gave me fucking keys.

149
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,711
Fuck.

150
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,708
You fucking scared me.

151
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,776
Don't I always say call me first
if you're coming into town?

152
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,355
Oh, my God! I called you so many times.

153
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,689
You have a fucking baseball bat?

154
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,319
Yeah.

155
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,092
Hmm.

156
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:39,228
What is this shit you put in your hair?
Honestly, it's awful.

157
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:42,068
- Shampoo.
- Is it for grooming dogs?

158
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,167
I want your love
I want your love

159
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,442
Good to see you.

160
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:53,049
I want your love
I want your love

161
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:54,813
- Lock the door next time.
- Yeah.

162
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,081
- Don't use all the towels.
- I won't.

163
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:02,654
I want your love
I want your love

164
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:11,061
I want your love
I want your love

165
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:19,869
I want your love
I want your love

166
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,500
But I want you.

167
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:57,371
I don't want anyone else.
There is no one else.

168
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:02,018
I love you. I'll do anything.

169
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,113
I'll do anything.

170
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,460
Please don't say that.

171
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,423
Please don't say that.

172
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,627
I love you. I love you.

173
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:23,641
I'll do anything. I'll do anything.

174
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,512
I don't have to go out!
I don't have to go out!

175
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,877
I don't even fucking want to go out!

176
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:34,350
I can stay with you.
I don't care. I don't care.

177
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:38,446
I don't need anybody else. I love you.

178
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:43,517
I love you. I love you so much.
I love you, please.

179
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:46,461
I love you. I love you.

180
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,559
Please.

181
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:54,064
I feel sick. I feel really sick.

182
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,708
- Morning.
- Morning.

183
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:07,149
Nice earring. Hot date?

184
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:13,115
- Juice?
- Mmm!

185
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:20,089
Will you use a glass?

186
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:21,894
Sorry.

187
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,574
You're going gray.

188
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,840
Do you think I look fat?

189
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,085
Do you think I look fat?

190
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,919
Sit down.

191
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,822
Fuck you!

192
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,564
I'm doing a couple gigs.

193
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,501
Yeah. Sure.

194
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,340
Can I stay?

195
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:08,039
- You want toast?
- Just for a few days?

196
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,082
I'd stay with Mark,
but he's being a fucking asshole.

197
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,812
- Mark?
- Please.

198
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,151
Jesus, Sissy.

199
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,755
What do you expect?

200
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,055
Pretty please?

201
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:27,324
Look, you get the sofa
and you get your ass off it

202
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:30,857
- before I leave every morning.
- I will. I promise. I will.

203
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,370
Okay. Okay. Okay.

204
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,834
- We leave in 15.
- Okay!

205
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:48,178
Mmm! So good!

206
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,230
Stop fucking around.

207
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,437
- Leave it.
- You have fluff.

208
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,571
I like it there.

209
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,854
- How are you for money?
- I'm good.

210
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,760
- 'Cause if you need some money...
- Honestly,

211
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,298
I even make money now and everything.

212
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,962
- Yeah, sure.
- Huge amounts.

213
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:42,929
What, you collect it in that hat?

214
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,507
You should come and hear me.

215
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,239
- Yeah, I will.
- "Yeah, I will"?

216
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,612
Like, "Yeah, I will," like last time?

217
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:56,711
Please come.

218
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,380
Where'd you get this, anyway?

219
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:00,048
It's vintage.

220
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,252
Yeah, I can see that.

221
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,593
Wow.

222
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,656
- Do you like?
- Yeah.

223
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:14,570
Please come.

224
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:19,667
Okay, I will.

225
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,171
Yay.

226
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,877
Sorry.

227
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,382
Fuck, my computer.

228
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:35,221
Well, well, well.

229
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,521
Morning, asshole.

230
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,893
Look who's decided to
grace us with his presence.

231
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:40,056
Yeah.

232
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:41,621
Don't tell me. No cabs.

233
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,759
No, your wife
wouldn't let me leave this morning.

234
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:46,326
Hey. That's not cool.

235
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:50,899
You should be so lucky.

236
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:54,468
- Any calls?
- Yes. Like, 50.

237
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,049
- Hey! Heads up, buddy.
- Whoa!

238
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,520
So, how'd it go last night?

239
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,859
Got home, went to bed. Good night.

240
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,451
Uh-huh. Right, right.

241
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,261
Let's do it again tonight.
Some place classier, though.

242
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,893
Yeah, my sister's playing
downtown somewhere.

243
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,697
She's playing?

244
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,637
She's a musician. Well, she's a singer.

245
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:25,233
Okay. Yeah, yeah. You know what?
That sounds like a lot of fun.

246
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,642
And that will ruin your enamel.

247
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,720
That elevator music's
like a bad acid trip.

248
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,820
- Good evening.
- Evening.

249
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,229
Reservation. Sullivan?

250
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,598
Great. I have you on the list.
I'll have you follow me?

251
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,138
Thank you.

252
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:58,303
- There you are.
- Right this way, please.

253
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,911
Wow, look at that ass.
I could follow that forever.

254
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,215
Nice pick.

255
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:13,618
Oh!

256
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,654
I forget how beautiful the city is.

257
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,655
Thank you.

258
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:27,269
Hi, guys. How are you both doing tonight?
What can I get you?

259
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:30,432
Your accent. Are you... You're from...

260
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:31,805
Brazil.

261
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,642
Rio? Hmm?

262
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,236
- São Paulo.
- Oh!

263
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,645
That is a beautiful city. That's...

264
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,514
- You've been there?
- Once or twice.

265
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,485
Can we get two dry martinis with olives?

266
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,680
Mmm-hmm.

267
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:46,781
And a little bit later,
why don't you come by for a drink with us?

268
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:48,892
I'll make sure I get those drinks.

269
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,359
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

270
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,697
She would be so offended if I didn't try.

271
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,596
Unbelievable.

272
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:12,406
Start spreading the news

273
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:24,556
I'm leaving today

274
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:35,496
I wanna be a part of it

275
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:40,738
New York

276
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:47,640
New York

277
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:57,618
I wanna wake up in a city

278
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:06,669
That doesn't sleep

279
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:15,101
And find I'm king of the hill

280
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:22,948
Top of the heap

281
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:33,497
These vagabond shoes

282
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:45,109
Are longing to stray

283
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:52,773
Right through the very heart of it

284
00:30:54,586 --> 00:31:01,515
New York, New York

285
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:11,997
If I can make it there

286
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:17,170
I'll make it

287
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:22,202
Anywhere

288
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:28,581
It's up to you

289
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:37,384
New York, New York

290
00:31:53,778 --> 00:32:00,684
I wanna wake up in a city

291
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:07,224
That doesn't sleep

292
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:14,861
And find I'm king of the hill

293
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,663
Head of the list

294
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,337
Cream of the crop

295
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:26,503
At the top of the heap

296
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:38,912
These little town blues

297
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:49,799
Are melting away

298
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:58,499
I'll make a brand new start of it

299
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:07,084
In old New York

300
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:17,517
If I can make it there

301
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:23,099
I'll make it

302
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:28,537
Anywhere

303
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:37,037
It's up to you

304
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:40,682
New York

305
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:50,459
New York

306
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:57,728
Wow. Wow! Bravo!

307
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,866
She's good! She's good!

308
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:11,807
- Hi.
- Hi.

309
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,441
- I'm David.
- Sissy.

310
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,042
- It is a pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet...

311
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,781
I think you are absolutely fantastic
and you look great in the dress, too.

312
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:20,187
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

313
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:22,921
What did you think?

314
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,792
Yeah, it was interesting.

315
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:27,421
What do you mean?

316
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:29,330
No, it was...

317
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,435
It was good. It was good.

318
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:34,334
It was good?

319
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,742
He was crying. He was crying.
There were tears coming down his face.

320
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,937
I saw it. You made a grown man cry.

321
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,036
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

322
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,512
I'm gonna get some drinks.

323
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,709
That's a great idea. Why don't you
get a round for the table, buddy?

324
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:53,455
Okay. I'm really sorry about that.

325
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,652
He's had a rough day at work.
I think he's a little bit emotional right now.

326
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,194
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

327
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,730
- So you guys grew up in Jersey?
- Yeah.

328
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:02,288
- You still live there?
- God, no.

329
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,926
That's good. That's good.
Where do you live now?

330
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:07,470
- Kind of all over the place.
- Yeah?

331
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:10,405
- What's the last city you've been to?
- L.A.

332
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:11,941
- Los Angeles?
- Mmm-hmm.

333
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:14,204
- Oh, boy. You like it there?
- I mean, I'm going back.

334
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:17,713
- That must mean you love it then, huh?
- No! I can't even fucking drive.

335
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,443
- Wait a minute. You can't drive?
- It's a nightmare.

336
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:20,984
- Nope.
- Why not?

337
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,714
I tried when I was a kid and I was horrible.

338
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,517
Wait, how old were you
when you quit driving?

339
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,387
- Sixteen.
- You were 16 years old?

340
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,584
Mmm-hmm.

341
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:31,719
So, wait a minute.
How do you get along in Los Angeles?

342
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:34,195
- I take the bus.
- No. No, no, no.

343
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:37,359
Look, a girl like you
cannot be taking the bus.

344
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,562
- What happened to your arm here?
- Oh!

345
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,571
When I was a kid, I was bored.

346
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,267
- You must have been really bored.
- I was.

347
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,071
All right, we've got a problem.

348
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,873
Your sister cannot be
taking the bus anywhere, okay?

349
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:49,412
I know a guy who owns
a car rental company.

350
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,345
We're gonna get you a car,
we're gonna drive around in circles

351
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:53,246
in a parking lot and you
are going to learn how to drive.

352
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,649
- Not stick, automatic. It's a little easier.
- I would love that.

353
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,312
You'd love that. That's good.
You know what? Better yet,

354
00:35:57,388 --> 00:36:00,789
we're gonna get you a golf cart
and you will drive the golf cart around.

355
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:03,656
Wow. Now we're talking.
Everybody should drive golf carts.

356
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:06,561
A golf cart right up Fifth Avenue, huh?

357
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:09,395
You know, they should. They should.
It would be a lot cleaner and greener.

358
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,765
It would be great for the city.
Brandon, what do you think?

359
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,565
- Sounds great.
- Yeah?

360
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:18,339
I love your brother. What an amazing man.

361
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,875
- How long are you here for?
- I don't know.

362
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,607
You don't know?

363
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:29,919
Can I see you again? Please?
Is that too forward? I find you fascinating.

364
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:32,983
I really do.
I think you're a fascinating creature.

365
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,490
I'd love to see you again.
Listen, why don't we...

366
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,151
This is a celebration, let's get champagne.

367
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,626
- Yes! Champagne!
- Champagne for everybody.

368
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,061
- The whole table! Come on.
- Champagne.

369
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,613
I've got it, I've got it.
Get out, get out, get out.

370
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,148
Come here, come here, come here.

371
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:02,584
- No!
- Come on, come on with me.

372
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,154
- Get off. Get off.
- How did that work?

373
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,782
- Get off me.
- Come on, come on.

374
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,588
Champagne on your dress, that's...

375
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:50,826
- Well, I'm hot, I'm hot.
- You are hot.

376
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,638
You are?

377
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:25,100
No! You're crushing me.

378
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:31,166
I need to take this off. I'm hot.
I need to take it off. I'm hot.

379
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:33,805
Nice sheets.

380
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:39,180
Aren't they nice sheets?
Bed Bath & Beyond.

381
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,512
Stop.

382
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:52,262
What if I kiss you right here?

383
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,268
How about here?

384
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,444
- Yeah?
- Shit.

385
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:24,325
Mmm-hmm.

386
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,423
What?

387
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:33,797
Stop talking!

388
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:29,878
I have to be up and out by 7:00.

389
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,938
It's cold.

390
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:37,447
Sissy, get out of my room.

391
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,990
Sissy, get out of my room.

392
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:51,261
Get the fuck out! Get out!

393
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:06,448
Hey, slacker. Your computer's back.

394
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:27,600
Dave's looking for you.

395
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:33,299
- Yeah. It was really great last night.
- Daddy, Daddy.

396
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,607
Listen, I gotta go, okay? Thanks for calling.

397
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:39,777
Hey, buddy.
Listen, we said an hour French,

398
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,546
and then Isobel's gonna pick you up
because Mommy's picking up Nathan.

399
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,212
All right? You can go after.

400
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,756
Yeah, I know, but Mommy says I can't.

401
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,258
Okay. Well, let's go talk to Mommy. Hmm?

402
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:53,586
- She's all the way downstairs.
- Well, go downstairs and tell her

403
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,599
that Daddy said
it's okay for you to go to Jason's.

404
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,531
Huh? Come on. How about that? Do it.

405
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:01,434
- You can do it. Get up.
- Okay.

406
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:03,200
Yeah.

407
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:06,265
Mommy? Mommy?

408
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,244
What's up, man?

409
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,804
- Steven said you wanted to see me.
- Yes.

410
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:13,850
Dude, 9:00 this morning, where were you?

411
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,282
- Dentist. Root canal.
- Oh, shit.

412
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:19,652
Now, what did I tell you about that?
Who did you see?

413
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:22,988
Gary Sher, King's practice,
West 57th Street.

414
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,257
Good. Good. You're stinging
the company health plan, I hope, right?

415
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,264
- Sure.
- That's what it's there for, man.

416
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,959
All right, brother.

417
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:32,967
Listen, one more thing.

418
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:37,599
Your hard drive is filthy, all right?
We got your computer back.

419
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,007
I mean, it is dirty.

420
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,738
I'm talking like hoes, sluts, anal,
double anal,

421
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:45,839
penetration, interracial facial, man.

422
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:48,476
Cream pie...
I don't even know what that is.

423
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:55,649
- You think it was your intern?
- On my hard drive?

424
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:57,819
Yeah, someone's fucking
with your account, man.

425
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:01,193
And we're blowing our wad in cash,
you know?

426
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:04,995
It takes a really, really sick fuck to
spend all day on that shit.

427
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:06,832
Daddy, Daddy.

428
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:08,895
Yeah. Hey, buddy. What'd she say?

429
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:12,408
She said I can go to Jason's for a half hour,
but I have to be home by 5:00 for dinner.

430
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:14,910
Okay. That's great. See?
Best of both worlds.

431
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:17,640
- You got everything you want. You happy?
- Yup. Yup.

432
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:21,082
- Yeah. You better be. Get out of here.
- Okay. All right, see you.

433
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:39,959
Hey. You like your sugar?

434
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:42,932
I do.

435
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:29,711
Hey.

436
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,245
- Hello.
- Hello.

437
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:33,977
Did you find it okay?

438
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:36,576
Yes, I'm glad you made it.

439
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:38,721
Yeah?

440
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:44,260
I'm late. Sorry.

441
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:48,322
You look handsome.

442
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:50,195
- You look amazing.
- Hi.

443
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:52,963
- Thank you.
- How are you doing tonight?

444
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,731
- Thank you.
- Okay.

445
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:58,366
I have a few specials on the menu,
if you'd like to hear them?

446
00:47:58,442 --> 00:47:59,602
Sure.

447
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:03,874
The soup of the day is tomato
with basil oil and Parmesan crostini.

448
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:08,617
The special is marinated swordfish,
tabouleh and Moroccan charmoula.

449
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:09,982
It's really good.

450
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:14,456
We're also serving a DeBragga and Spitler
New York Strip with a side order of fries,

451
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:18,119
and the salad is snow pea and radish
with a cider vinaigrette.

452
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:21,931
Can I start you off with a sparkling water?

453
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:23,489
- Tap water's fine.
- Okay.

454
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,331
And the wine menu is right next to...
Yup, there you go.

455
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,166
- You want some wine?
- Sure.

456
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:32,701
- White? Red?
- Red. Maybe...

457
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:35,301
Pinot Noir is light,

458
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:40,809
if you like it, like, light.

459
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,484
Great.

460
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,851
Okay. I'll be back.

461
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,022
So...

462
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,962
Where do you live?

463
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:58,524
- Brooklyn.
- Nice.

464
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,765
Born and raised. Where you from?

465
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:07,006
I was born in Ireland
and we moved here when I was a teen.

466
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:09,169
Did you get back much? Thank you.

467
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:10,838
A couple times.

468
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,981
A big family? You miss them?

469
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,444
Uh...

470
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:17,687
I have a sister.

471
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:22,690
I have two.

472
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:24,886
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

473
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,922
Older? Younger?

474
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,622
Older and younger.

475
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,599
I'm right in the middle.

476
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:37,999
What?

477
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:40,100
Just wondering.

478
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,635
Are you nervous?

479
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:45,409
- Why would I be nervous?
- You look a little nervous.

480
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,847
Do I?

481
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:49,778
- No.
- Well, what's a date?

482
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:51,411
It's no big deal.

483
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,814
It took me an hour to
figure out what to wear.

484
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:00,155
- You chose wisely.
- Yeah.

485
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:04,662
I'm sorry, but I forgot to say
the crab comes in the shell.

486
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,134
Great.

487
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:13,136
Oh! Yeah. I haven't even looked at this.

488
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,508
- I'll have the lamb.
- The lamb.

489
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:17,774
I'll have the lamb, too. That sounds great.

490
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,316
Okay. No appetizer?

491
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:23,043
- I'm fine.
- No.

492
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,418
Okay. And how would you like the lamb?

493
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:27,013
Medium.

494
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,923
We recommend it pretty pink.

495
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:33,153
- Okay.
- Yeah?

496
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:36,631
Okay. Pink it is.

497
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:41,234
Thank you. Excuse me.

498
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:46,837
So you seeing anyone at the moment?

499
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:49,174
No, I'm not. Are you seeing anyone?

500
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,448
- No.
- No? Really?

501
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:57,048
Why is that?

502
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:59,622
I don't know. It's just the way it is.

503
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:02,214
It's just the way it is. Yeah, I...

504
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:06,729
Actually, I'm separated.

505
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:11,064
- Tragedy.
- Yeah. Kind of a recent thing.

506
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,764
Okay.

507
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:16,863
You were married for long?

508
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:21,144
- No.
- Did we decide on the wine?

509
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:25,640
Well, yeah. Was it the Pinot Noir, you said?

510
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:28,377
Yeah, great. Great choice. Okay.

511
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:33,988
I wasn't married long. Gave it a shot.
It didn't really work out.

512
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,558
No.

513
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:37,625
- Wow.
- What?

514
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:40,128
- You just seem, like...
- What?

515
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:43,132
- Averse to the whole idea.
- Well, yeah.

516
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,896
I just don't understand why
people would want to get married.

517
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:49,905
Especially nowadays, I mean, it's...
You know?

518
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:52,531
I don't see the point.

519
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,311
In relationships?

520
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:57,869
It doesn't seem realistic.

521
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:05,650
- Are you serious? I mean...
- Yeah. I am, really.

522
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:10,625
Well, then, you know, why are we here,
if we don't matter to one another?

523
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:12,855
- Well...
- Why are you here?

524
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:15,989
The food is supposed to be great here.

525
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:18,864
No, no, no. I'm not saying it like that.

526
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:21,267
I mean... I just mean... You know?

527
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:25,435
One person for the rest of your life?
I mean, it's...

528
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:30,342
I mean, you come to restaurants,
you see couples sitting together,

529
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:33,940
and they don't even speak to one another,
they don't have anything to say.

530
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:37,851
They probably don't have to speak
because they're connected.

531
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:41,254
Or they're just bored with one another.

532
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:45,019
- Every...
- Here we go.

533
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:49,664
What's your longest relationship?

534
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,589
Um...

535
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:55,361
Exactly.

536
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:58,168
- That's... You can pour.
- Sure.

537
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,671
Four months.

538
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:11,051
You have to commit.
You have to actually give it a shot.

539
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:17,450
- I did. For four months.
- For four months.

540
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,944
Thank you.

541
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:45,380
Look, touch that.

542
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:47,946
Your head?

543
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:52,787
- No, no, no.
- You're such a weirdo.

544
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:56,263
No, seriously, seriously, seriously. Touch it.

545
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:59,025
Okay.

546
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:01,468
- Oh, my God.
- Do you feel that?

547
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:03,005
Yeah, what is it?

548
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,938
- It's a remnant.
- A remnant?

549
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:07,909
Yeah, from the Neanderthals.

550
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:10,572
There's only a few of us left
since the Homo sapiens took over.

551
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:11,636
Okay.

552
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:13,040
Hmm.

553
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:15,516
That would explain the forehead.

554
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,576
- What's that supposed to mean?
- "What's that supposed to mean?"

555
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:19,884
What do you mean?

556
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:23,151
Seriously, how did you get it? What is it?

557
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,490
- I used to play this game with my cousin...
- Mmm-hmm.

558
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:28,793
...where I'd sit on his feet
and he'd fly me through the air.

559
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:31,834
I hit my head off the ceiling
and I blacked out.

560
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:34,369
I was knocked out for five or 10 minutes.

561
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:36,928
- I peed my pants.
- Oh!

562
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:47,012
If you had a choice to
live in the past or the future,

563
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,210
and you could be
anything you wanted to be,

564
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,947
what would you be?

565
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,184
What would you be?

566
00:54:56,493 --> 00:55:00,327
Well, I always wanted to be
a musician in the '60s.

567
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:02,797
That's cool. A musician?

568
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:04,197
Yeah.

569
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:05,894
'60s is tough, though.

570
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:10,099
I saw Gimme Shelter recently, you know,
the Rolling Stones documentary?

571
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:12,437
- Yeah.
- It kind of seemed like hell.

572
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:13,798
What?

573
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:17,472
Yeah, the '60s would be, like,
the last place I would want to be.

574
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:19,538
- No way!
- Yes.

575
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:22,146
Ugh! Chaos!

576
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:25,585
So where and what would you wanna be?

577
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,747
Um...

578
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:31,217
You know, here, now.

579
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,722
That's boring.

580
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:36,788
Fuck you.

581
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:50,743
Okay. Well, this is me.

582
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:53,248
- This is you?
- This is me.

583
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:57,448
Thank you very much, Brandon.

584
00:55:58,221 --> 00:56:00,621
Thank you very much, Marianne.

585
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:06,124
We should do this again.

586
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,897
Right.

587
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:26,606
So is that a yes?

588
00:56:28,284 --> 00:56:30,013
Maybe, yeah.

589
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,664
Hello? Sissy?

590
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:30,142
Oh, fuck!

591
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,608
Fuck!

592
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:40,020
Fuck!

593
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,481
- What, are you fucking spying on me?
- Lock the fucking door, Brandon.

594
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,994
- Are you fucking spying?
- "Are you fucking spying?"

595
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:48,690
- Fuck! Brandon...
- What do you want?

596
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:50,562
You wanna fight? You wanna fight?

597
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,533
- You wanna fight?
- You want some of this?

598
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:53,864
What do you want from me?

599
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:55,199
- What do you want from me?
- Brandon!

600
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:56,363
- What do you want?
- Get off me!

601
00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:58,703
- Why did you come here? Why?
- Get off me! Get off me!

602
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:00,333
- Why? Why?
- Get off me!

603
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:02,901
- You're fucking hurting me.
- Talk to me! Fucking bitch!

604
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:05,311
Get the fuck off, you fucking weirdo.

605
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:06,973
- Fucking slut!
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

606
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:29,568
Brandon?

607
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,170
Brandon, I'm sorry.

608
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:53,220
Hey, where's Brandon?

609
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:56,759
Are you Brandon's girlfriend?

610
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,901
Do you wanna play?

611
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:03,732
You wanna play with my tits?

612
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:07,039
I know Brandon would really like it,

613
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:12,204
and I know exactly what Brandon likes.

614
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,623
Come on.

615
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,929
Where are you taking me?

616
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,871
Come on. You'll see.

617
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:22,100
- No, where are we going?
- Come on.

618
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:29,514
You want a drink?

619
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:37,920
What are you looking at?

620
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,620
This view is amazing.

621
01:01:50,406 --> 01:01:52,101
Hey.

622
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:46,850
Are they vintage?

623
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:49,452
A little bit.

624
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:51,686
I love it.

625
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:17,539
Oh, yeah.

626
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,023
Brandon?

627
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:24,010
You know, it's cool. It's okay.

628
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:29,751
Should I go?

629
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,377
Sure.

630
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:14,124
I can walk you down.

631
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:19,528
That's okay.

632
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:01,468
Can I get you a drink?

633
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:04,996
No.

634
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:13,876
Fuck.

635
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:15,473
Need a hand?

636
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:18,349
No. The hook's odd.

637
01:09:21,123 --> 01:09:22,988
There you go.

638
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:56,016
David?

639
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,518
Pick up.

640
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:03,959
I take it you're at your pottery class.

641
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,634
Have you eaten?

642
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:17,035
No.

643
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:18,670
Are you hungry?

644
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:20,271
No.

645
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:37,764
Can you just give me a hug?

646
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:07,792
He's not gonna screw you again.

647
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:14,432
You left him a message, didn't you?

648
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:17,895
You can't help yourself.

649
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:20,368
It's disgusting.

650
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:24,335
Why are you so fucking angry?

651
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:29,474
Why am I so fucking angry?

652
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,947
That's my boss.

653
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:39,760
You sleep with him after 20 minutes.
Now you're calling him up.

654
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:43,456
What's the matter with you?

655
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:47,692
You know he's got a family, right?

656
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:51,536
- You know he's got a family?
- No.

657
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,302
You didn't see
the wedding ring on his finger?

658
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:55,843
No.

659
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:57,401
You're a liar.

660
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,011
I'm sorry.

661
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:08,587
You're always sorry.
That's all you ever fucking say.

662
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:11,023
Well, at least I say I'm sorry.

663
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,091
Try doing something.

664
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:17,195
Actions count, not words.

665
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:21,131
I'm sorry.

666
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:23,802
I'm sorry.

667
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:27,203
I fucked up.

668
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:32,474
I'm not perfect.
I make mistakes, but I'm trying.

669
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:36,941
Some people fuck up all the time.

670
01:12:44,393 --> 01:12:46,088
Look, just forget it.

671
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:51,424
This isn't working out. Obviously.

672
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:56,164
You need to find somewhere else to live.

673
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:59,233
I don't have anywhere else to go.

674
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:06,613
This isn't about him.

675
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:11,912
I make you angry all the time
and I don't know why.

676
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:16,683
No. You trap me.

677
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:22,157
You force me into a corner
and you trap me.

678
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:26,296
"I've got nowhere else to go."

679
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:28,961
I mean, what sort of fucking shit is that?

680
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:30,504
You're my brother.

681
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:34,008
- So what? I'm responsible for you?
- Yes.

682
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:35,475
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you fucking are.

683
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:39,480
No, I didn't give birth to you.
I didn't bring you into this world.

684
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:42,547
You're my brother, I'm your sister.
We're family.

685
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:44,950
- We're meant to look after each other.
- You're not looking after me.

686
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:47,887
- I'm looking after myself.
- I'm trying. I'm trying to help you.

687
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:51,357
How are you helping me, huh?
How are you helping me?

688
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:53,518
How are you helping me?

689
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:57,522
Huh? Look at me. How are you helping me?

690
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:02,501
You come in here
and you're a weight on me.

691
01:14:02,571 --> 01:14:07,508
Do you understand me? You're a burden.
You're just fucking dragging me down.

692
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:09,934
How are you helping me?

693
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:12,572
You can't even clean up after yourself.

694
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:16,981
Stop playing the victim.

695
01:14:17,052 --> 01:14:19,577
I'm not playing the fucking victim.

696
01:14:20,088 --> 01:14:22,989
If I left, I would never hear from you again.

697
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:25,185
Don't you think that's sad?

698
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:29,323
Don't you think that's sad?

699
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:33,962
You're my brother.

700
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:46,105
Why is it always so dramatic with you?
Everything is always the end of the world.

701
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:49,742
It's not fucking dramatic.
I'm trying to talk to you.

702
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:52,681
I don't wanna talk.

703
01:14:55,824 --> 01:15:00,784
Try not talking.
Try just listening or thinking for a change.

704
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:04,098
Yeah, 'cause that's working great for you.
You're completely fine.

705
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:07,329
- I've got my own fucking apartment.
- Oh, whoopee-fucking shit.

706
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:09,427
You have your own apartment,
that's amazing.

707
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,905
You have a job and an apartment.
I should be in awe of you.

708
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:14,499
Well, at least I'm responsible for it.

709
01:15:14,576 --> 01:15:16,874
At least I don't
depend on people all the time.

710
01:15:16,945 --> 01:15:19,846
- You're a dependency. You're a parasite.
- You don't have anybody.

711
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:23,008
You don't have anybody. You have me
and your fucking pervert boss.

712
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:26,077
You slept with that fucking pervert boss.
What does that make you?

713
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:29,646
Don't talk to me about sex life, Brandon.
Not from you.

714
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:34,752
Whatever.

715
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:37,992
I'm going out.

716
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:39,693
Great. And then you'll come back

717
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:41,633
and we'll just have
the same fucking conversation again.

718
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:43,728
No, you'll move out.

719
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:48,038
And then I'll never hear from you again?

720
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:05,614
Hey.

721
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:07,245
Hey.

722
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:27,136
You wanna get out of here?

723
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:31,008
I could take you somewhere.

724
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:37,884
What, are you with someone?

725
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:44,758
Does he go down on you?

726
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:49,620
I do.

727
01:17:50,799 --> 01:17:53,097
That's what I like to do.

728
01:18:40,082 --> 01:18:42,380
I like the way it feels.

729
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:46,143
I like the way it's just me and it.

730
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:53,354
I wanna taste you.

731
01:18:54,796 --> 01:18:57,560
I wanna slip my tongue inside you,

732
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:02,093
just as you come.

733
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:13,243
You want me to make you come?

734
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:19,448
I can do that. Want me to do that?

735
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:21,250
What's up, babe?

736
01:19:22,824 --> 01:19:25,725
- I was just getting some drinks.
- Yeah, huh?

737
01:19:47,682 --> 01:19:49,115
Whoa.

738
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:51,048
Not tonight, buddy.

739
01:19:53,822 --> 01:19:55,756
I said not tonight.

740
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:11,270
I was just telling
your pretty girlfriend here,

741
01:20:11,339 --> 01:20:14,274
I'd like to fuck her
in that tight pussy of hers.

742
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:16,401
I mean, bone her real hard.

743
01:20:16,511 --> 01:20:19,036
- Till she's clawing up my back.
- He's kidding.

744
01:20:19,114 --> 01:20:20,741
This guy's funny.

745
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:25,987
After I fuck her hard up the ass,

746
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:29,751
I'll put my balls in her mouth
while I come in her face.

747
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:33,650
- You won't let me fuck you in the ass?
- Christ.

748
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:36,026
- You get to fuck her in the ass?
- You know.

749
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:38,861
Tell me more, man,
'cause I'm fucking loving this.

750
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:40,231
- Smell it.
- Yo!

751
01:20:40,302 --> 01:20:42,497
- Jesus, come on.
- You motherfucker.

752
01:20:52,781 --> 01:20:53,907
Hey, Romeo.

753
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:22,319
Brandon, it's Sissy.

754
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:24,490
I really need to talk to you.

755
01:23:25,633 --> 01:23:28,727
Please, will you pick up the fucking phone?

756
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:44,174
Brandon, I need you.

757
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:52,751
We're not bad people.

758
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:01,029
We just come from a bad place.

759
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:05,431
Thanks for letting me stay.

760
01:27:31,846 --> 01:27:33,404
Ladies and gentlemen,

761
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:40,081
at this time, due to a police investigation,
we have to discharge this train.

762
01:27:41,122 --> 01:27:44,250
Please follow the conductor to
the rear of the train.

763
01:27:44,325 --> 01:27:46,520
Watch your step between cars.

764
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:48,657
Watch your step.

765
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:51,396
Follow me, please. Follow me.

766
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:57,367
Watch your step. This way.
This way. Quickly.

767
01:27:57,438 --> 01:27:58,803
This way.
Nothing to see. Move on.

768
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:00,500
Right this way, please.

769
01:28:06,014 --> 01:28:10,417
This is Sissy.
Leave a message. Don't if you're an asshole.

770
01:28:19,427 --> 01:28:21,861
- This is Sissy. Leave a...
- Shit!

771
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:31,740
Shithead.

772
01:34:00,668 --> 01:34:01,726
God!

773
