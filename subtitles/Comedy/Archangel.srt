1
00:00:28,873 --> 00:00:29,851
Telephone.

2
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,906
It's Comrade Malenkov.

3
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,522
Stalin knew one thing: Force.

4
00:02:08,242 --> 00:02:12,202
During his reign,
20 million people lost their lives.

5
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:15,758
6 million were exiled,
18 million were shipped off to the Gulags.

6
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:22,286
Stalin...
he's to spend his evenings at the <i>Bolshoi</i>.

7
00:02:23,905 --> 00:02:28,045
Or ironically, watching American Westerns
in his own private screening room.

8
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:31,531
Later, before he retired to bed,

9
00:02:31,556 --> 00:02:35,306
he'd sign death warrants,
sometimes for up to 6,000 people.

10
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:42,803
And even then, even then,
he would write in the margins "not enough".

11
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,823
Make no mistakes.

12
00:02:45,848 --> 00:02:50,348
During the years of terror
the witch-finding general was Stalin himself.

13
00:02:50,777 --> 00:02:57,535
He said, "To choose one's victims,
to prepare one's plans minutely,"

14
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,089
"to slate an implacable vengeance,
and then go to bed."

15
00:03:03,437 --> 00:03:06,871
"There is nothing sweeter in the world."

16
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,430
Who are these people?
What's their problem?

17
00:03:36,814 --> 00:03:38,177
They called themselves "Aurora"

18
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:42,834
They are run by an old school
KGB hardliner called Vladimir Mamantov.

19
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,361
Yeah, he tried to man a coup
against Gorbachev.

20
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,110
Yeah, I interviewed him when
he came out of prison.

21
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,801
He still thinks the age of Stalin
is the golden era.

22
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:54,397
I apologize on behalf of [...].
Follow me to bus please.

23
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:57,766
Hey, Professor.

24
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,609
You think you know all
about Comrade Stalin.

25
00:04:03,418 --> 00:04:07,414
Let me tell you,
you don't know shit.

26
00:04:12,437 --> 00:04:14,227
Follow me to bus, please.

27
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:24,502
So here we are, with our degrees
and our double doctorates,

28
00:04:24,523 --> 00:04:26,886
swirling around Moscow
confronting the past.

29
00:04:26,928 --> 00:04:28,563
And the Russians don't want to hear about it,
you know,

30
00:04:28,588 --> 00:04:30,921
because they're still
scared shitless of Stalin.

31
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:33,166
- Oh, come on.
- No, Fluke has a point.

32
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:36,212
Unlike Hitler, he was never exorcised.

33
00:04:36,963 --> 00:04:40,673
They never had a Nuremberg, or Truth Commission,
like they did in South Africa.

34
00:04:41,574 --> 00:04:43,141
Hooten's the new Czar.

35
00:04:43,488 --> 00:04:44,800
This is his generation.

36
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:48,177
Mobile phones, martinis, and Hugo Boss.

37
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:49,801
[---] Stalin's into them.

38
00:04:50,181 --> 00:04:52,373
Yeah, but who's the generation
that doesn't live out their mistakes?

39
00:04:52,398 --> 00:04:53,952
Do you know what they're saying
to each other out there?

40
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:55,962
Josef would know how to deal with
these terrorists.

41
00:04:56,977 --> 00:04:58,563
Let me see if
I can get a table.

42
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,233
You wanna go somewhere else
for dinner?

43
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,848
Why do they call you Fluke?

44
00:05:09,364 --> 00:05:10,692
Because I was a mistake.

45
00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:14,439
My mother had me
when she was 46.

46
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,312
Somebody said the name
summed up your career.

47
00:05:17,507 --> 00:05:20,700
That just isn't nice, is it?
Italian or sushi?

48
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:24,791
You know... I think I'm just gonna
stick with the group.

49
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:27,724
Maybe another night?

50
00:05:30,945 --> 00:05:31,866
I [---].

51
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:50,607
What do you want?

52
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:56,687
I want someone to hear the truth.

53
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,980
I was there the night
Stalin laid dead.

54
00:07:02,228 --> 00:07:05,485
There I was driving Comrade Beria,

55
00:07:06,054 --> 00:07:11,486
Chief of the Secret Police,
Stalin's head chief man.

56
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,206
We left the [---] with the key,

57
00:07:17,231 --> 00:07:24,231
drove to the Kremlin,
straight to Stalin's private quarters.

58
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:25,860
Stay.

59
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:45,204
Why did Beria choose you?

60
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:50,305
Well, I was a new boy...
in the city.

61
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:56,677
A boy who would...
keep a secret.

62
00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:00,528
What did he find?

63
00:08:01,068 --> 00:08:06,148
He came from the room...
with a... folder.

64
00:08:07,638 --> 00:08:10,040
A notebook inside.

65
00:08:10,768 --> 00:08:13,962
Then I drove him to his house.

66
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:40,702
But why didn't Beria kill you?

67
00:08:41,745 --> 00:08:43,559
I mean,
he'd killed thousands for less.

68
00:08:44,676 --> 00:08:47,378
He was a... clever bastard.

69
00:08:48,305 --> 00:08:50,517
But he made a mistake...

70
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:56,600
...thinking everyone else was stupid.

71
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:03,770
But 3 months later
they buried him.

72
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:05,473
So what happened to you?

73
00:09:05,996 --> 00:09:09,374
They beat me, and other things...

74
00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:13,235
...but I never break.

75
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:18,423
So then they sent me
to the Gulag.

76
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:23,702
I came out in '69.

77
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,935
The day the Yankees
put a man on the moon.

78
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:39,677
First... first thing hit me.
Where was Stalin?

79
00:09:40,907 --> 00:09:47,368
No pictures, no statues.
There was disrespect.

80
00:09:48,566 --> 00:09:52,580
Papu, if this book really exists,

81
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:55,565
it's a piece of history.

82
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,877
What use is history to me?

83
00:09:58,582 --> 00:10:04,960
Well, history like this can sometimes
be worth a lot of money.

84
00:10:05,235 --> 00:10:07,735
For you,
for you and your family.

85
00:10:08,953 --> 00:10:10,981
I have no family.

86
00:10:11,765 --> 00:10:15,471
Only slut daughter.

87
00:10:17,524 --> 00:10:22,781
Who screws men like you
in clubs.

88
00:10:22,845 --> 00:10:26,394
Well, she won't have to anymore
if this is worth what I think it is.

89
00:10:31,752 --> 00:10:32,952
To Stalin.

90
00:10:35,116 --> 00:10:36,387
I'm just...

91
00:10:51,656 --> 00:10:52,101
Wait!

92
00:11:31,161 --> 00:11:33,797
Tomorrow we must meet in lobby
by 11 sharp.

93
00:11:33,955 --> 00:11:37,575
No one must be late, please.
For bus. [---]

94
00:11:41,109 --> 00:11:43,605
Oh, my God,
what happened to you?

95
00:11:44,293 --> 00:11:45,204
Research.

96
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,819
What was his name?
Was an old man. He had a story to tell.

97
00:11:54,452 --> 00:11:56,785
Sounds like a setup.
Yeah, why would he run out on me?

98
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:00,129
Because he doesn't want it
to look like a setup.

99
00:12:00,764 --> 00:12:02,554
Wants you to track him down.

100
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:07,650
Persuade him.
That's the psychology of a clutter fraud.

101
00:12:08,147 --> 00:12:10,620
Remember the Hitler diary?
I think he's for real.

102
00:12:11,268 --> 00:12:14,549
'Quod volimus credimus libenter'
Which means?

103
00:12:14,574 --> 00:12:15,524
Yeah, I know what it means.

104
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:18,478
We always believe what we want to believe.
Thank you, Adelman.

105
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,628
You don't want to hear that, do you?

106
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:25,705
You want him to lead you to
Stalin's unpublished memoirs.

107
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:32,454
You'll make millions of dollars, rewrite history,
and a choir would sing you praises at Harvard Yard.

108
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:37,592
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have coffee and tea in the annex.

109
00:12:38,513 --> 00:12:42,447
Gentlemen, R.J. O'Brian,
Moscow correspondent of SNS.

110
00:12:42,473 --> 00:12:43,404
How are you doing?

111
00:12:43,682 --> 00:12:48,169
In a full month,
we have boring people in a boring conference.

112
00:12:48,261 --> 00:12:50,048
You're Dr. Kelso, right?

113
00:12:50,948 --> 00:12:52,949
I read your last book.
What was it? 3 years ago?

114
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:55,280
4.
Actually, I believe it was 5.

115
00:12:55,311 --> 00:12:57,032
If we are gonna nitpick, it was 6.

116
00:12:57,057 --> 00:12:59,807
Why don't you took turns, Frank,
you would know something to say.

117
00:13:21,043 --> 00:13:24,226
- It is out of date.
- Yes I know. Is it possible that I can renew it?

118
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:26,456
I'm a professor.
I'm writing a book.

119
00:13:27,527 --> 00:13:29,642
Fill in form.
Send the mail.

120
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:33,769
Yeah, but I'm leaving Moscow tomorrow.
Can you help me please?

121
00:13:37,243 --> 00:13:38,869
I will talk to supervisor.

122
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,247
Are you the Kelso who wrote the book
on fall of the Communist Party?

123
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:58,219
Ah... yes!
Yes I guess I am.

124
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:02,293
- Great work! You really [---] the bastards!
- Thank you.

125
00:14:02,805 --> 00:14:06,566
- You are?
- [---] Elena [---].

126
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:12,278
I need everything you've got
on the death of Stalin, Elena.

127
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:16,874
- Statements, eyewitness accounts, please...
- She will not approve this.

128
00:14:17,245 --> 00:14:18,932
Does she have to know?

129
00:14:22,651 --> 00:14:23,358
Thank you.

130
00:14:27,285 --> 00:14:32,153
"Vladimir Mamantov"

131
00:14:35,553 --> 00:14:38,563
I found another one.
Page 512.

132
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:40,457
Thank you.

133
00:14:42,518 --> 00:14:46,820
So umm... you went to
Moscow State University?

134
00:14:46,821 --> 00:14:48,473
I did, yes.

135
00:14:48,498 --> 00:14:52,498
I spent a lot of time in this library
with a girlfriend. It was warm.

136
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,454
Is this your address?

137
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:06,036
No. It is where Beria lived.

138
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:14,057
You know they found
the human remains in the basement... bones.

139
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:47,394
He's a very busy man.

140
00:15:48,104 --> 00:15:52,104
Ah... I wrote an article on him a few years ago.
I'm Dr. Kelso.

141
00:15:52,687 --> 00:15:54,244
I have something
very important to tell him.

142
00:16:03,942 --> 00:16:07,366
Hmm... I remember you.
You wrote shit about me.

143
00:16:12,277 --> 00:16:13,333
About what?

144
00:16:14,216 --> 00:16:17,713
<i>About a notebook...
belonging to Josef Stalin.</i>

145
00:16:24,354 --> 00:16:26,096
You better come.

146
00:16:49,964 --> 00:16:52,201
Turn around.
Hands up.

147
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,037
What is it?
Take it out.

148
00:16:57,062 --> 00:17:00,062
It's just... I use it for making notes.
I wasn't... gonna...

149
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:05,337
- Thank you.
- Go in.

150
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,739
So you are part of
the gathering of thieves.

151
00:17:16,975 --> 00:17:20,055
Ah... I want a story,
I'm... I'm not a thief.

152
00:17:20,803 --> 00:17:23,764
Imagine if your country sold its
national archive

153
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:26,539
for a few miserable dollars.

154
00:17:30,314 --> 00:17:31,814
Viktor!

155
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,716
The same sickness Reagan had.

156
00:17:40,238 --> 00:17:40,908
I... I'm sorry.

157
00:17:41,697 --> 00:17:43,169
Ah... keep your pity.

158
00:18:03,815 --> 00:18:06,850
So... Stalin's notebook.

159
00:18:08,232 --> 00:18:09,831
Sounds like bullshit.

160
00:18:11,193 --> 00:18:14,931
No. It was mentioned in
Volkogonov's biography.

161
00:18:15,523 --> 00:18:17,820
His source was Aleksei Yepichev.

162
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:19,925
A man you knew well.

163
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:22,673
You wrote his entry in
the <i>Book of Heroes.</i>

164
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:28,155
Yes, I was with him at the end,

165
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,911
when Gorbachev came to power.

166
00:18:33,624 --> 00:18:36,677
A good time for
a decent communist to die.

167
00:18:37,277 --> 00:18:38,601
Did he ever mention that book?

168
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:41,123
Who told you about this?

169
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,546
An eyewitness...
from that time?

170
00:18:44,071 --> 00:18:44,571
Yes.

171
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:46,214
Name?

172
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:50,740
No, I rather not give it to you.

173
00:18:50,991 --> 00:18:52,923
So why are you here?

174
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:55,687
I want to find out
whether it's true or not.

175
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:02,949
(Chuckles) If it exists, it belongs in Russia,
not in some Californian University.

176
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,542
We're talking about a great man.

177
00:19:07,203 --> 00:19:09,971
I'm sorry.
I don't share your admiration.

178
00:19:10,361 --> 00:19:12,570
Really? I think you do.

179
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:17,904
When you saw his portrait,
you almost salivated.

180
00:19:22,586 --> 00:19:26,193
Stalin inherited the nation
with wooden ploughs,

181
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:31,447
and left us an empire
armed with atomic weapons.

182
00:19:32,078 --> 00:19:34,588
The man who came after him
pissed away...

183
00:19:35,158 --> 00:19:40,048
He saw it coming.
He told them, "After I've gone...

184
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:47,216
...the capitalists will drown you,
like blind kittens."

185
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,372
You'd like him back,
wouldn't you?

186
00:21:57,464 --> 00:21:58,439
Hello!

187
00:23:59,668 --> 00:24:01,777
Maggie, it's Fluke.
Look, I'm not getting back on Friday.

188
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:03,802
I'm gonna stay in Moscow,
something's come up.

189
00:24:04,655 --> 00:24:08,566
So ah... tell the boys I love them,
and that I will make it up to them.

190
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:14,212
- You know this place?
- It's a club.

191
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:16,924
Disco. Many girls.

192
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:22,838
Thank you.

193
00:24:23,413 --> 00:24:27,405
Winston Churchill once described Russia
as a...

194
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:33,030
...riddle, wrapped up in a mystery, inside an enigma.

195
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,273
Well I like to feel that the last few days

196
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:40,548
we've solved the riddle,
and unravelled the mystery,

197
00:24:40,823 --> 00:24:47,073
and we're left with the enigma,
which, I believe is the...

198
00:24:47,682 --> 00:24:49,741
It's kinda a last night thing.

199
00:24:52,211 --> 00:24:53,858
I didn't think you liked me.

200
00:24:54,448 --> 00:24:56,012
I don't like your type.

201
00:24:56,443 --> 00:24:57,569
And what type is that?

202
00:24:59,087 --> 00:25:02,888
Wonder boy. You said you're
used to dazzling people.

203
00:25:03,581 --> 00:25:06,620
You think the talent and looks
are your God given rights.

204
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:11,794
Well, it's a long time since
I've dazzled anybody.

205
00:25:14,292 --> 00:25:16,494
I just want to get laid
before I go back to Princeton.

206
00:25:17,154 --> 00:25:18,728
OK.

207
00:25:19,564 --> 00:25:20,755
Meet me by the lift.

208
00:25:33,561 --> 00:25:34,358
After you.

209
00:25:54,904 --> 00:25:57,190
Look, just hold this a second,
would you?

210
00:25:57,461 --> 00:25:58,919
I'm sorry about that.

211
00:26:02,172 --> 00:26:03,796
You total shit!

212
00:26:41,496 --> 00:26:45,412
Hi, I'm looking for someone,
Rapava, works here.

213
00:26:46,532 --> 00:26:48,598
I'll ask. What are you drinking?

214
00:26:49,626 --> 00:26:52,633
[---], no ice.

215
00:26:56,702 --> 00:27:01,032
Bribing bartenders, smart.
Get served first, impress the ladies.

216
00:27:01,777 --> 00:27:05,193
Remember me? Met you this morning.
R.J. O'Brian. How you're doing?

217
00:27:06,248 --> 00:27:08,042
- You're alone?
- Yeah.

218
00:27:08,912 --> 00:27:09,958
You won't be for long.

219
00:27:11,658 --> 00:27:14,952
The good ones ask for $400,
offer 2, settle on 3,

220
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,276
but be careful of the real babe,
they maybe spoken for.

221
00:27:19,506 --> 00:27:21,060
The other guy's Russian,
walk away.

222
00:27:21,284 --> 00:27:23,870
- I'm not looking.
- Oh, come on, everyone's looking.

223
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:32,734
Here... these girls have class, OK?
Tell the Professor what you do for a living.

224
00:27:33,383 --> 00:27:36,231
[---] Scandinavian businesses.

225
00:27:36,674 --> 00:27:37,362
See that.

226
00:27:37,771 --> 00:27:40,805
You see that girl,
Masha over there, red hair.

227
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:43,137
Works for the Moscow Currency Exchange.

228
00:27:43,771 --> 00:27:45,764
Where's Alisa?
She's a radiologist.

229
00:27:46,387 --> 00:27:49,327
- She was shot, R.J.
- Seriously?

230
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:56,544
Oh, Moscow may have its maximus, but is still dark city.

231
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:59,454
Though, I bet you're just
more interested in the old days, eh?

232
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:01,465
I heard you're chasing down a story.

233
00:28:02,216 --> 00:28:03,390
Ghosts from the past.

234
00:28:03,754 --> 00:28:04,546
Who told you that?

235
00:28:05,243 --> 00:28:09,347
- Adelman. Said you're really juiced.
- It's a dead end.

236
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,365
The bartender said you asked for me.

237
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:16,079
Ah... you're Rapava.

238
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:18,542
Looks like you're covered, Professor.
We'll talk soon.

239
00:28:19,604 --> 00:28:20,955
So how do you hear about me?

240
00:28:22,577 --> 00:28:24,661
It doesn't matter.

241
00:28:25,803 --> 00:28:28,051
- 400.
- 2.

242
00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:35,272
- 3.
- OK.

243
00:28:40,956 --> 00:28:44,232
Ah... my name's Fluke Kelso,
what's yours?

244
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,981
What name do you like?
What's your wife's name?

245
00:28:49,214 --> 00:28:51,269
I don't... actually have one
at the moment.

246
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:54,108
- OK. What's your hotel?
- Ukraina.

247
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:56,982
- What a dump...
- Look, actually, I don't want to sleep with you.

248
00:28:57,518 --> 00:29:01,283
Although that would be a...
very attractive proposition.

249
00:29:01,284 --> 00:29:03,086
but I need something else
from you.

250
00:29:03,731 --> 00:29:05,696
Whatever you want,
it's still 300.

251
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:07,875
I need to find your father Papu.

252
00:29:10,824 --> 00:29:13,271
Look, just take me to where he is.

253
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:18,522
Please, I... I'll still give you the money.
Please.

254
00:29:23,623 --> 00:29:27,932
- 400.
- Fine. Great. Thank you.

255
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:50,579
You're studying law!

256
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:52,854
- Money.
- What?

257
00:29:55,242 --> 00:29:56,865
Money.

258
00:29:59,853 --> 00:30:01,976
Half now, and then half later, yes?

259
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:07,876
I can get another fuck, Mister.
Can you get another ride?

260
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:46,341
Block #9, Apartment 12, 5th Floor,
the door code is 3131.

261
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,642
You not gonna come up with me?

262
00:30:50,699 --> 00:30:52,512
He doesn't like the way I dress.

263
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:58,010
- Will you wait?
- If you want.

264
00:30:58,961 --> 00:31:00,538
3131.

265
00:31:27,699 --> 00:31:28,437
Bitch!

266
00:32:06,832 --> 00:32:07,178
Hello?

267
00:34:00,486 --> 00:34:02,553
Please empty pockets.

268
00:34:02,978 --> 00:34:06,858
- What?
- Everything, passport, wallet, tie.

269
00:34:06,897 --> 00:34:10,472
Look, I have given my statement.
I'm a witness, I'm not a suspect.

270
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,411
I'll give you a receipt.

271
00:34:12,941 --> 00:34:15,658
OK, right, I wanna call the embassy.
I wanna know my rights.

272
00:34:16,298 --> 00:34:17,554
Shoelaces.

273
00:35:07,168 --> 00:35:08,772
- Mr. Kelso?
- What?

274
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,323
I'll give you a ride.

275
00:35:13,664 --> 00:35:16,745
Your plane, leave Sheremetyevo at 1:30.

276
00:35:17,506 --> 00:35:18,531
And you'll be on it.

277
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:20,626
You know what, this is outrageous.

278
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:24,080
I report a dead body,
I'm mobbed while I'm calling the police.

279
00:35:24,105 --> 00:35:25,281
I didn't kill the old man.

280
00:35:25,282 --> 00:35:26,886
Oh, but you did.

281
00:35:27,741 --> 00:35:30,751
When you told Mamantov
you had a witness from the old times.

282
00:35:31,473 --> 00:35:33,011
That was his death sentence.

283
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:34,755
I didn't give a name.

284
00:35:35,128 --> 00:35:36,470
He didn't need a name.

285
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:37,968
He already knew it.

286
00:35:38,276 --> 00:35:42,198
I didn't.
I have to dig for the old KGB files.

287
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:44,513
And what did you find?

288
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:48,284
I found Papu Gerasimovich Rapava.

289
00:35:49,361 --> 00:35:51,600
20 years after
he came out the Gulags,

290
00:35:52,305 --> 00:35:53,880
they arrested him again.

291
00:35:53,905 --> 00:35:56,905
And he was questioned by
the head of the Directorate,

292
00:35:57,596 --> 00:35:59,939
Vladimir Pavlovici Mamantov.

293
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,599
You see now...

294
00:36:03,624 --> 00:36:05,874
He precisely knew
who you were talking about.

295
00:36:07,093 --> 00:36:09,829
There were no other witnesses
from the old times.

296
00:36:10,446 --> 00:36:11,496
They're all dead.

297
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:16,123
So you bugged Mamantov's apartment?

298
00:36:16,292 --> 00:36:19,318
Yes, we bugged Mamantov's apartment.

299
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:25,420
We'd like to know what he did
with 500 million rubles.

300
00:36:25,445 --> 00:36:27,445
This we found out from the KGB files.

301
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,810
Yeah! But this is murder,
why didn't you bring him in?

302
00:36:30,346 --> 00:36:33,823
Professor, why don't you
go back home?

303
00:36:35,253 --> 00:36:38,149
Play your game of history
in your own country.

304
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,811
What, so you can find Stalin's files
and bury them?

305
00:36:42,438 --> 00:36:47,120
Mr. Kelso, I'm totally sick of
people like you.

306
00:36:48,446 --> 00:36:50,914
Throwing the past in our faces.

307
00:36:52,304 --> 00:36:58,941
And I'm sick of people like Mamantov,
trying to make gods out of monsters.

308
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,253
I'll take you back to your hotel.

309
00:37:26,314 --> 00:37:31,223
Listen... the old man,
he didn't break in '53,

310
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:33,748
or in the Gulag,
or later when they hold him in.

311
00:37:36,092 --> 00:37:37,991
What if he didn't break last night?

312
00:37:38,168 --> 00:37:39,168
So what's your point?

313
00:37:40,899 --> 00:37:45,202
I want to talk to his daughter.
Maybe you should get to her first.

314
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:01,769
Rough night, Professor?

315
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,483
I've had worse.

316
00:38:03,853 --> 00:38:06,456
Well, when I saw you leave
the Ju Ju Club with that lovely Zinaida...

317
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,215
That wasn't her name,
I didn't catch it.

318
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:12,838
Well tell me, did you get any action
before you got arrested?

319
00:38:13,669 --> 00:38:15,599
How the bloody hell
did you know that?

320
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,928
Professor, when a high profile westerner
ends up in a cell,

321
00:38:18,953 --> 00:38:21,080
I get a call and somebody gets [---].

322
00:38:22,081 --> 00:38:23,993
Look, you made Page 3.

323
00:38:24,294 --> 00:38:26,288
"Body found in bath of blood"

324
00:38:27,462 --> 00:38:29,033
Don't worry, you weren't mentioned.

325
00:38:29,814 --> 00:38:31,109
Cops give you a hard time?

326
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,129
I was sprung.
Excuse me.

327
00:38:34,058 --> 00:38:37,742
And a wank calls, wearing a cashmere coat,
hand made shoes.

328
00:38:37,911 --> 00:38:39,883
It's Intelligence. FSB.

329
00:38:40,534 --> 00:38:43,617
So, did he want to know about
Stalin's notebook?

330
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,112
Adelman told me.

331
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:49,591
Adelman's a prick.

332
00:38:49,647 --> 00:38:51,136
I'll tell you how much
of a prick he is.

333
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:52,509
The guy tried to rope me in.

334
00:38:52,534 --> 00:38:56,034
He says I find the book, we go 50-50
and leave you out of the loop.

335
00:38:56,621 --> 00:38:59,030
You academics! One sniff of a scoop

336
00:38:59,055 --> 00:39:01,805
and you make the paparazzi look like
a bunch of choir boys!

337
00:39:01,908 --> 00:39:03,196
It doesn't make any difference.

338
00:39:04,288 --> 00:39:05,355
I'm being deported.

339
00:39:05,847 --> 00:39:06,998
I'm not.

340
00:39:08,273 --> 00:39:09,714
Give me what you got.

341
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:13,567
It's dead.
Died with the old man.

342
00:39:20,335 --> 00:39:23,825
Oh Geez! Today customs wish
to open every bag.

343
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,148
Oh, this is not good!

344
00:39:27,175 --> 00:39:28,976
I bought an icon!

345
00:39:30,342 --> 00:39:31,460
You worry, Fluke?

346
00:39:31,985 --> 00:39:34,485
Got the Stalin diaries
tugged in your underwear?

347
00:39:38,692 --> 00:39:40,220
Have you told everyone?

348
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:43,508
Well, in all honesty,
I didn't take it too seriously.

349
00:39:45,069 --> 00:39:51,007
You know what, Frank.
Screw you!

350
00:40:09,671 --> 00:40:10,641
How did you find me?

351
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:13,864
I went to your hotel,
they said that you've checked out.

352
00:40:15,074 --> 00:40:18,810
Look, um... I've got to
get on a plane to New York.

353
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,681
I'd love to help you,
but I... I don't know how.

354
00:40:22,124 --> 00:40:24,712
I don't ask favours,
I never ask favours.

355
00:40:24,926 --> 00:40:25,818
So why are you here?

356
00:40:26,736 --> 00:40:29,547
When I got home last night,
there was a note from my father.

357
00:40:29,936 --> 00:40:33,699
It says there is something valuable,
and you can tell me what it is.

358
00:40:33,887 --> 00:40:35,210
In a tool box.

359
00:40:37,132 --> 00:40:38,130
Look, come here.

360
00:40:44,294 --> 00:40:48,655
Mr. Kelso!
Mr. Kelso!

361
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:51,126
When did you last see your father?

362
00:40:51,588 --> 00:40:52,656
3 days ago.

363
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:55,529
Before that, 8 years.

364
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:00,454
He came to the club, he saw my dress,
and called me a whore.

365
00:41:01,254 --> 00:41:03,687
I don't think he wait 8 years
just to tell you that.

366
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:07,608
I don't care.
I don't want him in my life.

367
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:09,883
He has always been a bastard.
Why would he change now?

368
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:14,627
Zinaida, your father is dead.

369
00:41:46,563 --> 00:41:47,170
We should go.

370
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:53,994
Who killed him?

371
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,335
They think a man called
Vladimir Mamantov.

372
00:42:00,912 --> 00:42:02,470
He knew your father
from the old time.

373
00:42:05,225 --> 00:42:07,653
What was in my life
that old time?

374
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,522
Here.

375
00:43:54,177 --> 00:43:54,944
That you?

376
00:43:55,954 --> 00:43:57,461
I'm surprised he kept it.

377
00:44:04,454 --> 00:44:06,844
I don't actually know
what I'm looking for.

378
00:44:08,516 --> 00:44:09,905
It's underneath you.

379
00:44:13,387 --> 00:44:13,935
Hold that.

380
00:44:30,024 --> 00:44:30,459
What is it?

381
00:44:44,953 --> 00:44:45,941
You know about guns?

382
00:44:47,514 --> 00:44:49,462
It was my father's.

383
00:44:50,028 --> 00:44:52,149
In Makarov, when I were little

384
00:44:52,174 --> 00:44:54,174
he told us how to
strip, clean, and fire it.

385
00:45:21,236 --> 00:45:22,416
Hey! Hey! Wo!

386
00:45:22,441 --> 00:45:23,383
Put your hands on your head!

387
00:45:23,408 --> 00:45:24,383
Hey!

388
00:45:24,384 --> 00:45:31,265
Ah, Professor, can you do me a favour
and just ask her to put that thing down.

389
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,773
What the hell are you doing here?

390
00:45:33,265 --> 00:45:35,996
Look, I was curious to see
if you got on that plane.

391
00:45:36,021 --> 00:45:37,021
And you didn't!

392
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:41,370
And... OK...
Now she's starting to freak me out.

393
00:45:42,111 --> 00:45:42,993
Put it down.

394
00:45:46,047 --> 00:45:49,269
Wait, I know you from the clubs.

395
00:45:49,761 --> 00:45:51,817
You're Zinaida, right?
You...

396
00:45:52,854 --> 00:45:54,082
Why is she here?

397
00:45:54,455 --> 00:45:55,814
She's Papu Rapava's daughter.

398
00:45:58,587 --> 00:46:00,814
So what are you guys doing?
Making some home improvements?

399
00:46:01,782 --> 00:46:03,119
What's that got something
to do with that?

400
00:46:04,334 --> 00:46:06,414
You'd never gonna shake my ass
off of this.

401
00:46:07,611 --> 00:46:11,366
I'm a pitbull, Professor,
so we may as well partner up.

402
00:46:13,225 --> 00:46:15,289
You two can split
whatever loot you make.

403
00:46:15,674 --> 00:46:16,667
Is it valuable?

404
00:46:17,373 --> 00:46:18,994
If it's what the Professor
thinks it is,

405
00:46:19,037 --> 00:46:20,783
it could be worth
half a million, yeah.

406
00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:22,659
Dollars?

407
00:46:23,721 --> 00:46:24,946
That's right.

408
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:28,850
Let's open it up.

409
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:32,485
Wait, I want to capture
this moment.

410
00:46:38,376 --> 00:46:40,883
- You don't drive a BMW?
- No, it's not my style.

411
00:46:41,422 --> 00:46:43,426
We were followed by a 7-series.

412
00:46:43,721 --> 00:46:47,261
7-Series?
Sounds like a Mafia car.

413
00:46:47,574 --> 00:46:48,935
Or a cop on the take.

414
00:46:48,936 --> 00:46:51,325
- Jesus, you live in here.
- I didn't beg, dad.

415
00:46:54,325 --> 00:46:58,254
Look, you do this,
as long as you keep her name out of it.

416
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:02,469
And you don't show any of this footage until
we get that thing properly forensically analyzed.

417
00:47:02,811 --> 00:47:04,001
Anything else, Professor?

418
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:05,614
Yeah, you can stop calling me Professor.

419
00:47:06,118 --> 00:47:09,353
- Can I call you Doc?
- No.

420
00:47:28,166 --> 00:47:29,237
What is it?

421
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:38,243
Well...

422
00:47:45,767 --> 00:47:47,683
It's embossed with the seal of
the Soviet Union,

423
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:50,208
which would suggest
it's something official.

424
00:48:23,361 --> 00:48:25,279
Well, it's not Stalin's writing.

425
00:48:26,334 --> 00:48:28,138
What are you talking about?

426
00:48:31,965 --> 00:48:36,264
It written about Stalin...
but it's... it's not his writing.

427
00:48:36,618 --> 00:48:39,505
Oh great,
press just take a nosedive.

428
00:48:45,316 --> 00:48:48,966
Console Unit #2 display their paces.

429
00:48:50,483 --> 00:48:55,943
We marched across Red Square,
and as we pass beneath him,

430
00:48:56,746 --> 00:49:01,601
his glance fall upon us,
like the rays of the sun.

431
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:05,843
It's the writing of a young girl.

432
00:49:12,434 --> 00:49:15,053
I remember the day the comarde
from Moscow came to visit,

433
00:49:15,515 --> 00:49:18,021
the leader of the local party
met him at the station.

434
00:49:18,439 --> 00:49:20,943
He had the biggest car in Archangel.

435
00:49:25,706 --> 00:49:29,522
The comrade explained,
that since the parade in Moscow,

436
00:49:29,856 --> 00:49:34,172
I had been selected for special task
relating to high party leadership.

437
00:49:35,227 --> 00:49:38,667
If I accept,
I must return to Moscow with him.

438
00:49:38,984 --> 00:49:41,058
And stay there for a year.

439
00:49:44,934 --> 00:49:48,554
My father says,
if it is the will of the party,

440
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,475
he will not prevent me.

441
00:49:52,262 --> 00:49:54,566
I'm so happy
I could die.

442
00:50:02,592 --> 00:50:04,717
We went south through the forest...

443
00:50:05,067 --> 00:50:08,098
...Konosha, Vologda, Yaroslav.

444
00:50:08,363 --> 00:50:12,062
Last time there were 20 of us,
silly laughing girls.

445
00:50:12,644 --> 00:50:17,716
Now there was only me.
I'm a little afraid, so far from home.

446
00:51:36,577 --> 00:51:37,706
I will take care of this.

447
00:52:05,276 --> 00:52:06,845
That's alright.
She's been covered.

448
00:52:07,937 --> 00:52:09,437
Let's get out of here!

449
00:52:10,007 --> 00:52:11,269
Go to my office.

450
00:52:49,738 --> 00:52:54,327
Comrade Stalin has asked that from now on
I'm to bring him breakfast.

451
00:52:55,289 --> 00:52:59,672
[---] till he falls asleep,
wherever he finds himself.

452
00:53:00,258 --> 00:53:04,171
How I wish that people could
see him like this;

453
00:53:04,876 --> 00:53:09,748
so humble, so dedicated to their welfare.

454
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:10,550
That's great!

455
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:12,524
What's the date of the entry?

456
00:53:14,633 --> 00:53:16,129
It's 21st of October.

457
00:53:16,433 --> 00:53:19,523
She got there on the 12th, I mean...
she's been there for... what... 8 days.

458
00:53:20,221 --> 00:53:21,673
And he still hasn't jumped her.

459
00:53:24,418 --> 00:53:27,232
When I leave the room
I hear him cursing.

460
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:29,953
He has cut himself.

461
00:57:45,082 --> 00:57:48,255
That's it?
That's all?

462
00:57:49,184 --> 00:57:52,524
See for yourself.
The last pages have been torn out.

463
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:54,262
Oh shit.

464
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:58,518
What are all these doodles?
Look, it looks like a wolf's head.

465
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,817
Stalin used to draw the heads of wolves
in the margins of official documents.

466
00:58:03,622 --> 00:58:05,313
So this is genuine?

467
00:58:06,297 --> 00:58:11,243
Un... until I have it forensically tested,
I just... I just can't say.

468
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:13,643
Bottom line, Doc,

469
00:58:13,668 --> 00:58:16,918
I hold you up against a brick wall
with a gun, what's your opinion?

470
00:58:19,013 --> 00:58:20,168
It's genuine.

471
00:58:20,927 --> 00:58:21,855
Good.

472
00:58:22,436 --> 00:58:23,769
What about all these other stuff?

473
00:58:23,994 --> 00:58:25,249
Hey, look, be careful!

474
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,884
It an NKVD report.

475
00:58:34,359 --> 00:58:36,640
It's their family's medical history.

476
00:58:38,338 --> 00:58:46,452
Teeth... blood group...
no genetic disorders...

477
00:58:46,925 --> 00:58:48,795
The old bastard only screws
prom queens?

478
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:50,746
Why would he keep her diary?

479
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:55,580
Obsession, infatuation.

480
00:58:55,893 --> 00:58:59,567
On the train she says that that was
the worst day to travel because it was that time.

481
00:59:00,653 --> 00:59:01,631
Meaning what?

482
00:59:02,516 --> 00:59:04,144
She had had period.

483
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:08,099
And last night when
he called her to his room,

484
00:59:08,676 --> 00:59:10,175
it was 10 days later.

485
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,617
- She was fertile!
- That's it.

486
00:59:13,903 --> 00:59:15,937
That's what the medical report is about.

487
00:59:16,747 --> 00:59:18,833
He was looking for
the perfect mother for his child.

488
00:59:19,778 --> 00:59:21,487
You know what we gonna do,
we gonna find this girl.

489
00:59:22,334 --> 00:59:23,331
Find her?
She'd be dead.

490
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,249
Oh you can't be sure.
She'd only be about... what... 70.

491
00:59:26,488 --> 00:59:28,645
Yeah, but that's not the point.
She wouldn't have died of old age.

492
00:59:28,835 --> 00:59:30,516
Who do you think we're dealing with here,
Prince Charming?

493
00:59:30,746 --> 00:59:32,252
Maybe, but this is a huge story.

494
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,277
We gonna run this down.
We gonna go to Archangel.

495
00:59:34,665 --> 00:59:37,108
I... I can't go to any airport.

496
00:59:37,313 --> 00:59:42,980
Look... we'll head straight up the M-8,

497
00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:45,171
it's about 7, 8 hundred miles.

498
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:46,926
We'll take the war wagon.

499
00:59:47,156 --> 00:59:51,470
A flask of coffee, a few uppers,
a stack of CDs... loving it... Louise...

500
00:59:52,885 --> 00:59:53,984
I'm not going anywhere.

501
00:59:54,195 --> 00:59:55,449
Oh, no.
You have to.

502
00:59:56,002 --> 00:59:58,125
If you stay in Moscow,
they'll find you and they'll kill you.

503
00:59:58,223 --> 00:59:59,933
For what? For this?

504
01:00:00,294 --> 01:00:02,524
Your father died because
he wouldn't tell them where it was.

505
01:00:02,549 --> 01:00:04,164
Because he wanted you to have it.

506
01:00:04,665 --> 01:00:06,047
Not worth die for.

507
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:07,658
Stubborn old fool!

508
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:11,159
He died because he wanted to
leave you something of value

509
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:13,499
so that you can get out,
so you can stop being a...

510
01:00:13,524 --> 01:00:14,723
A whore?

511
01:00:14,724 --> 01:00:16,060
Like you and O'Brian.

512
01:00:17,835 --> 01:00:22,881
Look, um... he's a hack!

513
01:00:23,802 --> 01:00:26,138
He not going to sell this,
we have to ditch him.

514
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:28,995
Is that what he said is the truth?

515
01:00:30,735 --> 01:00:32,325
It's worth a lot of money?

516
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:37,499
Yeah, a lot of money.

517
01:00:40,123 --> 01:00:42,061
You supposed to be in
St. Petersburg tomorrow.

518
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:43,668
We've rescheduled this twice already.

519
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:45,879
Why don't we just dump it?
I'll talk to the chief.

520
01:00:46,224 --> 01:00:47,592
We're gonna get some warm clothes.

521
01:00:48,012 --> 01:00:50,273
OK, but...
let's try and leave before dark.

522
01:00:52,987 --> 01:00:54,367
Where about is your place from here?

523
01:00:54,771 --> 01:00:56,194
North. 20 minutes.

524
01:00:56,428 --> 01:00:58,380
Good.
We'll get your stuff and keep going.

525
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:00,136
Although we're not going to
get very far on this.

526
01:01:00,778 --> 01:01:02,573
No need.
Here's O'Brian's.

527
01:01:04,947 --> 01:01:08,019
- We steal?
- We steal.

528
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:31,756
What did she say?

529
01:01:32,707 --> 01:01:34,225
She says there's someone in there.

530
01:01:34,418 --> 01:01:36,423
Right, well, let's go.
We'll buy some clothes on the way.

531
01:01:36,515 --> 01:01:37,693
There's something I need.

532
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:07,640
Do you know him?

533
01:02:07,879 --> 01:02:08,540
Of course not.

534
01:02:09,963 --> 01:02:11,124
Let's go.

535
01:02:11,429 --> 01:02:14,146
I told you
there is something that I need.

536
01:02:24,947 --> 01:02:26,030
What are you thinking?

537
01:02:26,834 --> 01:02:29,089
How many men I slept with
to get this cash?

538
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:33,723
No. Just wondering how you
find the time to study law.

539
01:02:57,902 --> 01:02:59,300
Archangel.

540
01:03:01,094 --> 01:03:02,728
Founded by Peter the Great,

541
01:03:03,249 --> 01:03:05,594
named after the Archangel Michael,

542
01:03:06,102 --> 01:03:07,560
the "Warrior Angel."

543
01:03:08,601 --> 01:03:13,575
Until the fall of communism,
it was a forbidden city closed to
all outside visitors.

544
01:03:13,764 --> 01:03:16,790
They had nuclear subs there.
They leaked.

545
01:03:19,535 --> 01:03:20,513
Why are we slowing down?

546
01:03:21,147 --> 01:03:23,094
The car behind us.

547
01:03:23,569 --> 01:03:25,150
It's the Militia.

548
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:28,563
Shit.

549
01:03:29,101 --> 01:03:30,859
O'Brian didn't waste much time, did he?

550
01:03:36,055 --> 01:03:36,804
It's OK.

551
01:03:38,029 --> 01:03:39,768
They're not interested in us.

552
01:03:49,156 --> 01:03:53,851
Ah... I don't know if I can
handle <i>Rock & Rap</i> for 500 miles.

553
01:04:09,438 --> 01:04:11,248
The whole area was used for
nuclear weapons.

554
01:04:11,694 --> 01:04:13,255
Oh, listen to this,
travellers' tip.

555
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:17,454
When arriving at the railway station,
check the digital radiation meter.

556
01:04:17,629 --> 01:04:22,815
If it is 15 microrads or below, it's safe.
Sounds like a fun place!

557
01:04:23,541 --> 01:04:25,189
2-and-a-half thousand dollars.

558
01:04:25,205 --> 01:04:26,250
Was that round trip?

559
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:27,414
One way!

560
01:04:28,012 --> 01:04:29,014
When can he leave?

561
01:04:29,509 --> 01:04:30,196
10.

562
01:04:30,234 --> 01:04:31,454
Tell him he's got a deal.

563
01:04:31,895 --> 01:04:33,358
OK, he'll be there at 9.

564
01:04:35,611 --> 01:04:39,241
Yes. Yes, of course, cash, yep.

565
01:04:41,051 --> 01:04:42,500
R.J., I think you're crazy!

566
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,511
Weather's bad, it's getting worse.

567
01:04:44,715 --> 01:04:47,421
Yeah, that's why I have to leave tomorrow,
or I'll never get in.

568
01:04:48,101 --> 01:04:49,400
What do I tell head office?

569
01:04:49,641 --> 01:04:53,878
You're going off radar leaving them
with a $2,500 tap for a charter.

570
01:04:54,776 --> 01:04:56,960
I give them a taste.
Book me some satellite time.

571
01:06:12,064 --> 01:06:13,319
Very sheik!

572
01:06:13,583 --> 01:06:15,570
Well there's not much call
for Versace out here.

573
01:06:16,585 --> 01:06:18,591
And I don't think we will
find a sushi bar either.

574
01:06:20,731 --> 01:06:22,508
These small towns are forgotten.

575
01:06:23,532 --> 01:06:26,164
The old die, the young leave.

576
01:06:26,957 --> 01:06:29,455
And you leave Moscow and you realize
Moscow is a treasure.

577
01:06:31,185 --> 01:06:32,422
You smoke too much.

578
01:06:34,811 --> 01:06:37,367
- I know.
- How old are you anyway?

579
01:06:37,978 --> 01:06:39,616
- 27.
- You?

580
01:06:40,605 --> 01:06:41,573
Older.

581
01:06:42,726 --> 01:06:44,307
I prefer to go with older men.

582
01:06:45,013 --> 01:06:45,862
Safer...

583
01:06:46,366 --> 01:06:47,533
...and less exhausting.

584
01:06:50,327 --> 01:06:51,723
Ever pay for it, Fluke?

585
01:06:51,985 --> 01:06:52,804
Once.

586
01:06:53,538 --> 01:06:54,706
When I was 16.

587
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,415
I needed to lose my virginity.

588
01:06:58,095 --> 01:06:59,545
It was weighing me down.

589
01:07:04,085 --> 01:07:05,283
You should do that more often.

590
01:07:06,533 --> 01:07:08,215
- What?
- Laugh.

591
01:07:10,216 --> 01:07:11,803
Come on.
We've got a long way to go.

592
01:07:13,035 --> 01:07:17,510
<i>The victim was later identified as
Papu Gherasimovici Rapava.</i>

593
01:07:17,870 --> 01:07:20,469
<i>A 73 year old survivor
of the Gulag</i>

594
01:07:27,063 --> 01:07:30,712
<i>...the whereabouts of a secret diary
belonging to Josef Stalin,</i>

595
01:07:30,737 --> 01:07:33,237
<i>and this knowledge
may have cost him his life.</i>

596
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:36,319
R.J. O'Brian, SNS News, Moscow.

597
01:07:36,977 --> 01:07:39,720
'cuse me,
can you tell me where the pilot is?

598
01:07:42,921 --> 01:07:45,514
God!
The plane is older than me!

599
01:07:46,289 --> 01:07:47,289
So fuck it!

600
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:50,863
Are you the pilot?

601
01:07:55,481 --> 01:07:57,930
- Mr. O'Brian?
- R.J.

602
01:07:58,005 --> 01:07:59,204
- Lev.
- Ready to go?

603
01:07:59,229 --> 01:08:00,728
Mmm...

604
01:08:01,229 --> 01:08:02,229
Right.

605
01:08:03,882 --> 01:08:06,097
- Here you are.
- Thank you. Let's go.

606
01:08:10,261 --> 01:08:12,275
You know what
the weather's like in Archangel?

607
01:08:12,844 --> 01:08:16,768
- I risk it if you will.
- Shouldn't we have a navigator, or somebody?

608
01:08:17,111 --> 01:08:20,899
- No, afraid not.
- Ah ha, that's great! Ah! Just terrific!

609
01:08:21,424 --> 01:08:25,558
Take a seat. [---] it's <i>First Class.</i>

610
01:08:55,589 --> 01:08:58,454
Hey! Hey!

611
01:08:58,863 --> 01:09:00,794
- Hmm?
- Road block ahead.

612
01:09:02,291 --> 01:09:04,130
And my visa's run out.

613
01:09:06,099 --> 01:09:07,324
I'll handle it.

614
01:09:44,574 --> 01:09:45,488
How'd you manage that?

615
01:09:47,562 --> 01:09:49,715
I gave him a month's wages.

616
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:35,487
Wait!

617
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:42,250
OK.

618
01:11:10,083 --> 01:11:11,575
Nicer foulups.

619
01:11:16,227 --> 01:11:17,870
Eat, it's not bad.

620
01:11:22,152 --> 01:11:24,898
The party,
[---] an office, won't they?

621
01:11:26,666 --> 01:11:28,032
We should check their records.

622
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:34,859
To find out about this girl
is very important for you, yeah?

623
01:11:35,581 --> 01:11:37,154
More important than anything,
I guess.

624
01:11:38,518 --> 01:11:41,587
- Yeah.
- For me, history is dead.

625
01:11:42,649 --> 01:11:45,994
It tells us what happened,
not what happens next.

626
01:11:47,139 --> 01:11:48,350
That is what I care about.

627
01:11:49,556 --> 01:11:50,379
Well, that's wrong.

628
01:11:50,904 --> 01:11:54,154
You think because Russia has MTV and
MacDonald's and accepts American Express...

629
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:56,060
...that it's just the same as
everywhere else.

630
01:11:56,088 --> 01:12:00,948
Well, that's bullshit. Because you won't
understand Russia until you understand its past.

631
01:12:03,216 --> 01:12:05,556
Thank you for the lecture, Professor.

632
01:12:15,073 --> 01:12:18,151
Just tell her that we've travelled
an awfully long way. We're very discreet.

633
01:12:18,176 --> 01:12:20,926
And we... we just need to see
some records of Party members.

634
01:12:35,868 --> 01:12:40,178
Why would you be interested in
someone from this remote place?

635
01:12:41,555 --> 01:12:42,788
I'm researching a book.

636
01:12:43,741 --> 01:12:44,920
On what subject?

637
01:12:47,349 --> 01:12:50,858
On the residual power of the Communist Party
in rural Russia.

638
01:12:53,029 --> 01:12:55,999
Excellent subject.
Wilfully ignoring the West.

639
01:12:57,653 --> 01:12:59,498
Take our situation here.

640
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:03,233
We have people who have got rich, millions.

641
01:13:03,941 --> 01:13:07,788
We also have organized crime, unemployment,

642
01:13:08,054 --> 01:13:12,176
AIDS, prostitution and drug addiction.

643
01:13:12,201 --> 01:13:13,283
Such progress!

644
01:13:13,284 --> 01:13:14,659
Not like in the good old days, eh?

645
01:13:15,644 --> 01:13:22,059
We had work, we had pride,
now we have free markets and rich [---].

646
01:13:22,425 --> 01:13:25,179
I see you've read
comrade Mamantov.

647
01:13:26,459 --> 01:13:29,092
I was with him 2 days ago in Moscow.

648
01:13:46,669 --> 01:13:49,897
It's incredible,
they haven't thrown anything away.

649
01:13:50,811 --> 01:13:52,686
Like they're waiting for
the second coming.

650
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:58,954
Most curious, the [---] from 1950 and 51.
Anna's here.

651
01:13:59,562 --> 01:14:02,833
They were transferred to
the Central Committee in Moscow.

652
01:14:03,869 --> 01:14:05,052
On whose authority?

653
01:14:05,422 --> 01:14:07,254
General Poskrebyshev.

654
01:14:08,038 --> 01:14:10,082
Comrade Stalin's private secretary.

655
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:13,744
I'm impressed.

656
01:14:15,481 --> 01:14:16,515
Dead end?

657
01:14:17,307 --> 01:14:21,615
The Party file is listed
Mihail and Varvara Safanov.

658
01:14:22,359 --> 01:14:24,224
The parents.
When did they die?

659
01:14:24,475 --> 01:14:27,460
Mihail died in 1988.

660
01:14:28,274 --> 01:14:30,499
They wouldn't pay her Party [---]

661
01:14:32,088 --> 01:14:33,800
She's still alive!

662
01:16:11,682 --> 01:16:15,877
Maybe it was just a routine check.
Maybe they haven't connected us with the car.

663
01:16:16,563 --> 01:16:18,054
Maybe it too many maybe's.

664
01:16:21,818 --> 01:16:25,201
- Oh, Jesus.
- How did you get the scratch on my bumper, Professor?

665
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:27,113
How the hell did you get here?

666
01:16:27,594 --> 01:16:29,093
It wasn't easy,
you son of a bitch!

667
01:16:29,486 --> 01:16:30,737
Get in, we can't stay here.

668
01:16:31,064 --> 01:16:32,602
Why'd you cut me
out of the loop, ah?

669
01:16:32,764 --> 01:16:34,821
All I wanted was the story,
you get the rest.

670
01:16:35,129 --> 01:16:37,155
- Book deal, lecture tours, ...
- Get in!

671
01:16:38,315 --> 01:16:39,223
Did you find Anna?

672
01:16:39,246 --> 01:16:42,589
- We found her mother.
- Oh, you got to be kidding!

673
01:16:47,765 --> 01:16:50,372
So, where is Mr. O'Brian now?

674
01:16:50,635 --> 01:16:54,509
He had to charter a plane because
those guys stole his jeep;

675
01:16:54,685 --> 01:16:57,343
which really pissed him off
because he's married to that thing.

676
01:16:57,736 --> 01:16:59,338
So, your boss is following them?

677
01:17:00,235 --> 01:17:01,175
Where?

678
01:17:01,549 --> 01:17:02,867
North.

679
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:05,297
Archangel.

680
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:08,823
Archangel?
Why?

681
01:17:09,745 --> 01:17:12,108
Because that's where the girl lived.

682
01:17:15,482 --> 01:17:16,859
What girl?

683
01:20:28,806 --> 01:20:31,777
Yeah, yeah. I got to go, Todd.
Alright, I'll catch up with you later.

684
01:20:33,729 --> 01:20:35,267
- Who's Todd?
- Have you ever used one of these?

685
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:37,279
- Who is Todd?
- Wanna to call your girlfriend?

686
01:20:37,509 --> 01:20:41,368
Ah, Todd...
Todd is a guy in the newsroom.

687
01:20:42,196 --> 01:20:43,343
And what were you asking him?

688
01:20:43,368 --> 01:20:45,868
Just asking him about the World Series.
I got some money on it.

689
01:20:48,122 --> 01:20:51,270
O'Brian, how did you hook up
with this at the lockup?

690
01:20:51,945 --> 01:20:53,954
OK, I got a tip that
you were at the morgue.

691
01:20:55,396 --> 01:20:56,235
From who?

692
01:20:56,543 --> 01:20:58,401
No idea.
It was a voice on the phone.

693
01:20:58,755 --> 01:21:00,272
Well, keep a lid on this
until the time is right.

694
01:21:00,297 --> 01:21:01,241
That was the deal.

695
01:21:01,492 --> 01:21:03,477
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got it.
No problem.

696
01:21:22,413 --> 01:21:25,020
She seemed to have
opened up to you.

697
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:30,150
Perhaps too much.

698
01:21:31,536 --> 01:21:33,794
She must have been told
never to speak of these things.

699
01:21:34,410 --> 01:21:36,673
Dear, a long time ago.

700
01:21:36,906 --> 01:21:39,503
People in Russia don't lose
their fear because they get old.

701
01:21:40,272 --> 01:21:41,605
Maybe she's holding all these.

702
01:21:42,192 --> 01:21:44,244
Maybe once we leave,
she makes a call.

703
01:21:46,868 --> 01:21:49,663
Maybe you should stay here tomorrow
and make sure she doesn't.

704
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:52,203
Why me?
Let O'Brian stay.

705
01:21:53,066 --> 01:21:55,240
Well, if I do that,
he's just going to call the office.

706
01:21:55,389 --> 01:21:57,200
At least this way I can
keep an eye on him.

707
01:21:58,032 --> 01:21:59,688
We'll be back by nightfall.

708
01:22:00,617 --> 01:22:01,300
OK.

709
01:22:03,007 --> 01:22:05,166
But you should know something else
that she'd told me.

710
01:22:07,362 --> 01:22:09,557
Her husband wanted to
meet his grandson.

711
01:22:10,466 --> 01:22:12,516
He took off the same way
that you are taking.

712
01:22:14,013 --> 01:22:15,620
He never came back.

713
01:22:20,754 --> 01:22:22,536
They killed her, didn't they?

714
01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:24,692
After the baby was born?

715
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:29,613
Yeah.
Yeah, they did.

716
01:22:32,212 --> 01:22:35,912
Look I'm... I'm gonna go in now.
It'll be a long drive tomorrow.

717
01:23:32,965 --> 01:23:34,275
Is this road on the map?

718
01:23:38,147 --> 01:23:39,588
Only on a dotted line.

719
01:23:45,755 --> 01:23:47,247
What's that up there?

720
01:24:27,853 --> 01:24:28,845
Married couple.

721
01:24:29,344 --> 01:24:30,254
Soldiers.

722
01:24:31,793 --> 01:24:33,392
It's incredible.

723
01:24:33,993 --> 01:24:37,573
A whole colony of people posted down here
in the widlerness to look after one life.

724
01:26:55,305 --> 01:26:56,625
Hang... hang on.

725
01:27:04,913 --> 01:27:06,305
Hold it... hold it.

726
01:27:09,426 --> 01:27:12,002
Oh, my God!

727
01:27:14,124 --> 01:27:14,625
Oh!

728
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:17,900
- You alright?
- Yeah.

729
01:27:19,325 --> 01:27:23,389
Like somebody's uh...
somebody's build a tank trap!

730
01:27:24,302 --> 01:27:25,875
I'm never gonna get out of this thing!

731
01:27:26,384 --> 01:27:27,857
Isn't that the point?

732
01:27:28,205 --> 01:27:31,333
No sweat. We got the phone,
we got food, we got water.

733
01:27:33,956 --> 01:27:36,969
Hey, hey, we got company.

734
01:27:54,484 --> 01:27:58,137
Umm, I think we may have
taken a wrong turn.

735
01:27:58,590 --> 01:28:00,572
Uh, our map is out of date.

736
01:28:00,986 --> 01:28:04,334
If... if you can just help us get out,
we... we can get back to the main drag.

737
01:28:07,564 --> 01:28:09,582
You are the ones, I think.

738
01:28:12,111 --> 01:28:13,861
You believe you know
who I am?

739
01:28:14,124 --> 01:28:16,819
Yes?
You want proof?

740
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:19,469
No. No, no.
No, we don't need proof.

741
01:28:21,306 --> 01:28:22,464
We trust you.

742
01:28:23,015 --> 01:28:27,903
Imperialists!
All those sweet words!

743
01:28:28,153 --> 01:28:30,670
And then they kill you for a [---]

744
01:28:35,135 --> 01:28:41,498
Come.
Come!

745
01:28:48,515 --> 01:28:52,115
Well...
we found him.

746
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:04,684
OK, we got 2 of us and 1 of him.
You think you can get that rifle off him?

747
01:29:04,691 --> 01:29:05,710
Don't even think about it.

748
01:29:39,003 --> 01:29:41,321
Suvorin.

749
01:32:17,612 --> 01:32:19,230
<i>Order of the Hero</i> of the Soviet Union.

750
01:32:41,464 --> 01:32:42,580
What was that all about?

751
01:32:43,856 --> 01:32:45,908
He said his time is coming.

752
01:32:46,585 --> 01:32:47,231
What's that mean?

753
01:32:49,291 --> 01:32:51,309
It... it means we were expected.

754
01:32:51,644 --> 01:32:55,833
Well, looks like we're not the first
people to have come here.

755
01:33:07,847 --> 01:33:10,039
These people came here?

756
01:33:10,883 --> 01:33:12,304
Yes.

757
01:33:15,569 --> 01:33:18,015
They say they're tourists.

758
01:33:20,371 --> 01:33:23,520
What are they looking for?
Wolves?

759
01:33:26,690 --> 01:33:30,357
No. They were surprised.

760
01:33:33,658 --> 01:33:35,710
I have their confessions here.

761
01:33:38,958 --> 01:33:44,737
They denied it first.
But admitted it all by then.

762
01:33:53,779 --> 01:33:55,316
These look like bloodstains.

763
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:58,995
Think we have to make confessions?

764
01:34:38,432 --> 01:34:41,027
Capitalism is thievery.

765
01:34:44,744 --> 01:34:48,263
We protect ourselves from these capitalists,

766
01:34:49,011 --> 01:34:52,852
these stinking,
crawling thieves of all mankind,

767
01:34:53,997 --> 01:34:56,512
only by ferocious vigilance.

768
01:34:57,719 --> 01:35:00,398
Tell me about the Chizhikov's, comrade.

769
01:35:02,373 --> 01:35:05,268
He brought you up like
you were their child.

770
01:35:06,757 --> 01:35:09,119
He was a soldier and a hunter.

771
01:35:10,562 --> 01:35:12,997
When he drank, he beat me.

772
01:35:13,594 --> 01:35:17,330
Comrade, until I'm in blood.

773
01:35:19,592 --> 01:35:20,737
How did he die?

774
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:26,129
He was so drunk,
he fell into one of his own traps.

775
01:35:28,235 --> 01:35:29,845
[---] death.

776
01:35:30,969 --> 01:35:34,700
And his wife? She must have been
like a mother to you.

777
01:35:37,804 --> 01:35:41,576
She was.
When she was old, she couldn't work.

778
01:35:45,689 --> 01:35:47,657
It was a hard thing to do.

779
01:35:48,755 --> 01:35:53,011
But for the best.

780
01:35:56,075 --> 01:35:58,513
Would... would you like to see a picture
of your real mother?

781
01:35:58,538 --> 01:35:59,488
I have one here.

782
01:36:00,739 --> 01:36:02,952
I have pictures of my father,

783
01:36:03,592 --> 01:36:05,153
that is all I need.

784
01:36:08,373 --> 01:36:11,225
My father used to make
his comrades dance.

785
01:36:16,841 --> 01:36:19,958
Dance for me!

786
01:36:48,697 --> 01:36:49,546
Dance!

787
01:37:52,313 --> 01:37:54,813
Ah! Jesus!
Ah!

788
01:37:59,839 --> 01:38:01,975
Hey! wake up! wake up!

789
01:38:03,744 --> 01:38:05,037
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

790
01:38:18,196 --> 01:38:20,323
I don't know if he gonna
make us breakfast or kill us.

791
01:38:21,936 --> 01:38:26,257
You know I'll be a lot happier
if somebody in this world knew where we are.

792
01:38:40,853 --> 01:38:42,060
Guess we're not prisoners.

793
01:38:43,557 --> 01:38:45,630
We're meant to be here.
Too many coincidences.

794
01:38:45,655 --> 01:38:46,524
Ah, what do you mean?

795
01:38:47,525 --> 01:38:50,068
You got a tip,
a voice on the phone.

796
01:38:50,476 --> 01:38:53,672
That the Beria mansion has literally
a door left wide open for me.

797
01:38:53,922 --> 01:38:55,598
The old man at Communist HQ,

798
01:38:55,623 --> 01:38:59,123
he dust off all his old files 'cause I give him
some bullshit story about writing a book.

799
01:39:00,828 --> 01:39:02,148
Mamantov is behind this.

800
01:39:02,647 --> 01:39:05,816
OK, I've got a blinding hangover.
What are you saying?

801
01:39:06,032 --> 01:39:10,428
His whole... platform is based upon a
"Return to Stalinlism"

802
01:39:10,944 --> 01:39:13,121
And what do you think the dispossessed
and disaffected is gonna do

803
01:39:13,146 --> 01:39:14,837
when he wheels out
the <i>New Messiah?</i>

804
01:39:14,838 --> 01:39:16,536
No one is going to give a shit,
the guy looks like Davy E. Crock...

805
01:39:16,561 --> 01:39:18,061
He's Stalin's son.

806
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:22,177
That man's father is responsible for
more deaths than

807
01:39:22,202 --> 01:39:24,702
Adolf Hitler, Pol Pot, and
Genghis Khan combined.

808
01:39:24,710 --> 01:39:26,339
And that is a conservative estimate.

809
01:39:26,602 --> 01:39:30,323
30 million Russians think
that man's dad did a good job.

810
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:27,806
Ah shit!
There's just too many trees.

811
01:40:28,512 --> 01:40:32,335
This far north you gonna have the dish
at really lower angle to send a signal.

812
01:40:33,102 --> 01:40:35,088
We need more space.

813
01:41:06,919 --> 01:41:09,838
You know, I think we gonna need
an escape route.

814
01:41:10,875 --> 01:41:12,074
Maybe you want to...

815
01:41:12,099 --> 01:41:15,599
go down there and see if there's a boat,
or a canoe of some kind.

816
01:41:16,169 --> 01:41:16,895
All right.

817
01:41:20,069 --> 01:41:22,594
Watch your step.
He's got traps, remember?

818
01:41:27,462 --> 01:41:30,505
There you go, R.J.

819
01:41:51,072 --> 01:41:53,400
Alright, you should be getting
the unedited material now.

820
01:41:53,425 --> 01:41:55,425
Then I'll do an actual intro, OK?

821
01:41:55,699 --> 01:41:56,652
I'll talk to you in 5.

822
01:42:40,022 --> 01:42:42,619
Here in the northern tundra of Russia,

823
01:42:42,986 --> 01:42:45,640
a story is unfolding which will shake the world.

824
01:42:45,977 --> 01:42:48,305
For 50 years,
this forbidden wilderness

825
01:42:48,663 --> 01:42:52,072
has hidden a secret,
known only to a handful of

826
01:42:52,097 --> 01:42:56,847
fanatical, hardlined communists
faithful to the memory of Josef Stalin.

827
01:42:56,873 --> 01:42:58,317
What the hell are you doing?

828
01:43:00,058 --> 01:43:01,872
You can't put that out there.

829
01:43:02,131 --> 01:43:03,084
That's what they want.

830
01:43:03,422 --> 01:43:06,157
You heard what the old log chopper said, huh,
"His time is coming!"

831
01:43:06,326 --> 01:43:08,703
Any minute he going to
polish his boots and march into town.

832
01:43:08,705 --> 01:43:09,605
Turn that camera off.

833
01:43:09,646 --> 01:43:12,453
Now, look, look, this is my story, Doc.
And your book.

834
01:43:12,496 --> 01:43:13,363
Well I not gonna write it.

835
01:43:13,388 --> 01:43:14,888
Nah, just, come on...

836
01:44:33,575 --> 01:44:35,773
Press! Press!

837
01:44:52,705 --> 01:44:55,069
You should have gotten on
that plane, Professor.

838
01:44:55,949 --> 01:44:58,848
Where is he,
the man you came to see?

839
01:44:59,236 --> 01:45:00,517
He was here when we left.

840
01:45:00,641 --> 01:45:04,354
Look, I.. I would just want to say
that I am a acredited journalist, OK?

841
01:45:04,379 --> 01:45:06,629
And my bureau does know that
I am here, alright?

842
01:45:07,248 --> 01:45:09,087
Then they'll wonder
what happend to you.

843
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,750
Run!
Run!

844
01:46:08,025 --> 01:46:09,025
Run!

845
01:46:42,471 --> 01:46:45,003
- You OK?
- No! My shin! my shin!

846
01:49:56,632 --> 01:49:57,132
Hello...

847
01:49:58,908 --> 01:50:02,708
Hello, can you...

848
01:51:02,627 --> 01:51:05,909
Da. I'm afraid he is.

849
01:51:40,797 --> 01:51:42,353
- Where is O'Brian?
- He's dead.

850
01:51:42,378 --> 01:51:43,072
What?

851
01:51:43,073 --> 01:51:44,632
There were soldiers.

852
01:51:44,678 --> 01:51:45,702
Then how safe are we now?

853
01:51:46,387 --> 01:51:49,436
I don't have anybody left alive to report back.
So that's just give us a couple of hours.

854
01:51:51,335 --> 01:51:52,326
Did Mamantov send them?

855
01:51:52,330 --> 01:51:54,697
No, the Kremlin.
Mamantov wants me alive.

856
01:52:37,341 --> 01:52:39,726
- Is it him?
- Yes.

857
01:52:40,916 --> 01:52:42,112
So what does it mean?

858
01:52:44,541 --> 01:52:47,880
It means that poor old O'Brian
let the genie out of the bottle.

859
01:52:51,730 --> 01:52:52,925
Come on!

860
01:53:27,046 --> 01:53:28,127
Where is the rest?

861
01:53:29,574 --> 01:53:30,856
I got you out of jail.

862
01:53:36,276 --> 01:53:37,161
This is yours.

863
01:53:46,535 --> 01:53:49,239
Explain to me why did Mamantov
want you to find this?

864
01:53:50,645 --> 01:53:53,365
This has no credibilty

865
01:53:53,851 --> 01:53:57,139
if it is suddenly produced by
an old school hardliner like Mamantov.

866
01:53:57,526 --> 01:53:59,595
It stings of forgery
and self interest.

867
01:54:00,456 --> 01:54:04,187
And me, I'm a Western academic.
I'm a published author.

868
01:54:04,712 --> 01:54:09,962
And... and I... I'm an objective...
expert on all things Stalin.

869
01:54:10,164 --> 01:54:12,013
And my father was a part of this?

870
01:54:12,771 --> 01:54:14,072
Yeah.

871
01:54:15,388 --> 01:54:16,710
So why did he die?

872
01:54:17,646 --> 01:54:19,868
He didn't... follow the script.

873
01:54:21,823 --> 01:54:26,073
When I told him
how valuable this was, he...

874
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:28,032
...he only wanted to leave it to you.

875
01:54:30,876 --> 01:54:32,745
I tell you it's cursed.
It's yours.

876
01:54:33,514 --> 01:54:35,427
It's ours.
It's ours.

877
01:54:36,318 --> 01:54:39,544
When we get to Moscow,
we go straight to the American Embassy,

878
01:54:39,569 --> 01:54:41,506
 and we'll get out of Russia.

879
01:54:41,507 --> 01:54:42,176
We?

880
01:54:42,945 --> 01:54:45,193
Come with me,
to New York.

881
01:54:49,919 --> 01:54:50,953
Nice fantasy.

882
01:55:05,762 --> 01:55:06,512
You awake?

883
01:55:12,288 --> 01:55:14,827
The only time I ever
connected with my father

884
01:55:16,798 --> 01:55:19,093
was when he taught me
how to use a gun.

885
01:55:23,626 --> 01:55:25,694
He hardly spoke
to my brother and me.

886
01:55:28,866 --> 01:55:30,706
He could not touch us.

887
01:55:31,332 --> 01:55:32,099
Never hold us.

888
01:56:01,726 --> 01:56:03,921
He was brutalised.

889
01:56:04,309 --> 01:56:06,150
Many of us were.

890
01:56:06,415 --> 01:56:09,400
I was...
too young to understand.

891
01:56:14,275 --> 01:56:15,872
My mama always did.

892
01:56:19,114 --> 01:56:21,570
Even his silences.

893
01:56:23,153 --> 01:56:26,092
Or his drunken rages.

894
01:56:26,993 --> 01:56:29,324
She'd always shown compassion.

895
01:56:36,264 --> 01:56:38,189
She understood what
they've made him.

896
01:56:43,926 --> 01:56:49,591
Dr. Kelso, come please,
and...uh, bring it.

897
01:57:10,962 --> 01:57:12,462
Come on, please!

898
01:57:32,738 --> 01:57:34,903
You... would destory this?

899
01:57:37,184 --> 01:57:38,876
You are historian.

900
01:57:39,881 --> 01:57:45,017
You have this burning urge to
preserve every historical document.

901
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:50,434
This for you, is the way back,
better than your wildest dreams.

902
01:57:52,471 --> 01:57:58,054
Getting famous all over again.
You go on television, lecture college campuses.

903
01:57:59,568 --> 01:58:01,421
Screw many girls.

904
01:58:03,038 --> 01:58:04,522
It's your way back!

905
01:58:05,446 --> 01:58:06,794
That's the problem.

906
01:58:07,633 --> 01:58:11,873
No. It is all mutual benefit,
this whole plan.

907
01:58:12,405 --> 01:58:13,547
Good plan.

908
01:58:14,043 --> 01:58:16,520
I used KGB funds
to buy Beria's mansion.

909
01:58:16,862 --> 01:58:19,025
I financed conferences
you speak at.

910
01:58:20,708 --> 01:58:24,877
First class tickets, free vodka,
how could you resist?

911
01:58:29,182 --> 01:58:32,710
Tortoruing and killing old man,
was that part of the plan?

912
01:58:34,082 --> 01:58:36,573
And what about those psychopaths
running around in the woods?

913
01:58:36,843 --> 01:58:41,807
A glitch. But everything turned out good
for both of us, huh?

914
01:58:43,380 --> 01:58:44,762
Win, win. Yes?

915
01:58:47,166 --> 01:58:50,929
Well let's see.
You got a mad man on the loose.

916
01:58:51,195 --> 01:58:53,720
And maybe suffering from a
major congenital defect.

917
01:58:54,785 --> 01:58:56,422
You think you can control him?

918
01:58:56,667 --> 01:58:59,394
If he's his father's son,
which I truly believe he is.

919
01:59:00,977 --> 01:59:02,738
You could be one of his first victims.

920
01:59:10,758 --> 01:59:12,743
Maybe he's right, comrade.

921
01:59:13,693 --> 01:59:16,579
Maybe I play gramophone,
and make you dance.

922
01:59:38,408 --> 01:59:39,809
We're stopping at the next station.

923
01:59:40,416 --> 01:59:41,901
- Where are we?
- Vologda.

924
01:59:42,662 --> 01:59:46,032
- They let you go?
- Mamantov's on the train, with Josef.

925
01:59:51,726 --> 01:59:52,421
My God!

926
01:59:59,588 --> 02:00:01,682
Jesus Christ!
It's already started.

927
02:00:08,864 --> 02:00:10,957
Listen, get off this train now.

928
02:00:10,982 --> 02:00:13,982
Pay someone to drive you to Moscow.
Go to the airport and get on a plane.

929
02:00:14,010 --> 02:00:15,217
- To go where?
- Anywhere.

930
02:00:15,642 --> 02:00:17,733
Huh, and where are you going?

931
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:19,084
To do what they want.

932
02:00:58,867 --> 02:01:01,554
Hey, what's going on?

933
02:01:02,084 --> 02:01:03,401
Have you seen R.J.?

934
02:01:04,518 --> 02:01:06,714
- R.J. is dead.
- What?

935
02:01:13,380 --> 02:01:15,642
- Can you put that on me?
- Yeah.

936
02:01:16,547 --> 02:01:17,120
Film this guy.

937
02:01:19,113 --> 02:01:22,175
I am Professor Christopher Kelso.
This...

938
02:01:22,992 --> 02:01:25,272
This whole spectacle has been contrived

939
02:01:25,297 --> 02:01:31,297
 and stage managed by a man whose
only goal is absolute power through torture and...
