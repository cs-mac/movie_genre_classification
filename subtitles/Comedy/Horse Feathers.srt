1
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,776
And so, in retiring as president
of this college,

2
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,906
it is indeed a painful task
to bid you all goodbye.

3
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,742
And now, with the utmost pleasure,

4
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,955
may I present the man who is to guide
the destiny of this great institution:

5
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:26,294
Professor Quincy Adams Wagstaff!

6
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:36,304
Professor, it is an honor
to welcome you to Huxley College.

7
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,098
Never mind that, hold this coat.

8
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,563
By the way, there's no smoking.

9
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,065
That's what you said.

10
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,197
It would please the faculty
if you would throw your cigar away.

11
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:59,410
The faculty can keep their seats.
There'll be no diving for this cigar.

12
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:02,747
Members of the faculty,
faculty members,

13
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,041
students of Huxley
and Huxley students!

14
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,501
I guess that covers everything.

15
00:02:07,918 --> 00:02:10,296
I thought my razor was dull
until I heard his speech.

16
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:14,759
Which reminds me of a story so dirty
I'm ashamed to think of it myself.

17
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:19,764
As I look at your faces, I understand
why this college is flat on its back.

18
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:24,518
At my last college, it was slightly
different. I was flat on my back.

19
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:27,354
Things went from bad to worse,
but we all pulled together,

20
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:30,149
and soon I was flat on my back again.

21
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:32,776
Any questions? Any answers?

22
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:36,238
Any rags? Any bones?
Any bottles today? And rags...

23
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:40,826
Let's have some action around here.
Who'll say 76? Who'll say 1776?

24
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:43,495
That's the spirit! 1776!

25
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:45,873
You'd like to know why I'm here.

26
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,459
I came here to get my son out.

27
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:51,795
I remember the day he left:
A mere boy and a beardless youth.

28
00:02:52,212 --> 00:02:56,258
I kissed them both goodbye.
By the way, where is my son?

29
00:02:57,301 --> 00:03:00,637
Young lady, would you get up
so I can see the son rise?

30
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:07,769
So, doing your homework in school, eh?
- Hello, old-timer!

31
00:03:08,186 --> 00:03:13,442
I'm sure the students would appreciate
an outline of your future plans.

32
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:17,988
What? - I said they would appreciate
an outline of your future plans.

33
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:21,742
You just said that. That's the trouble
around here: Talk, talk, talk.

34
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,163
I think I must go mad. Where will it
all end? What is it getting you?

35
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,458
Go home to your wife.
No, I'll go home to your wife.

36
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,960
Outside of the improvement,
she'll never know the difference.

37
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:36,339
Pull over to the side of the road
and let me see your marriage licence.

38
00:03:36,756 --> 00:03:39,926
President Wagstaff, now that you
have stepped into my shoes...

39
00:03:40,343 --> 00:03:42,804
Oh, is that what I stepped in?

40
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:47,559
At least you could have cleaned them.
- The trustees have a few suggestions.

41
00:03:47,976 --> 00:03:51,313
I think you know what the trustees
can do with their suggestions.

42
00:03:53,106 --> 00:03:56,609
"I don't know what they have to say,
it makes no difference anyway,

43
00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:59,237
Whatever it is, I'm against it.

44
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,326
No matter what it is and who
commenced it, I'm against it.

45
00:04:06,786 --> 00:04:11,040
Your proposition may be good, but
let's have one thing understood.

46
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,917
I'm against it!

47
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:17,755
And even when you've changed it
or condensed it, I'm against it.

48
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:21,342
I'm opposed to it.

49
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,012
On general principles opposed to it."

50
00:04:24,637 --> 00:04:29,475
"He's opposed to it. In fact it seems
that he's opposed to it!"

51
00:04:32,854 --> 00:04:35,982
"For months before my son was born,
I used to yell from night to morn:

52
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,235
Whatever it is, I'm against it!

53
00:04:39,652 --> 00:04:44,657
And I've kept yelling since I first
commenced it: I'm against it!"

54
00:04:51,164 --> 00:04:55,418
"Knowing Dad as I do,
I'd not advise you

55
00:04:55,835 --> 00:05:00,089
to displease him, or tease him.
No, no!

56
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:06,304
Don't double-cross him
or toss him around.

57
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:11,475
When dear old Dad once gets mad

58
00:05:11,892 --> 00:05:15,146
he's a hound!"

59
00:05:16,397 --> 00:05:19,108
"My son is right, I'm quick to fight,
I'm from a fighting clan.

60
00:05:19,525 --> 00:05:23,028
When I'm abused or badly used,
I always get my man.

61
00:05:25,531 --> 00:05:28,117
No matter if he's in
Peru, Peduka or Japan,

62
00:05:28,534 --> 00:05:31,203
I go ahead, alive or dead,
I always get my man."

63
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:37,084
"He goes ahead, alive or dead,
he always gets his man."

64
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:40,212
"I soon dispose of all of those
who put me on the pan.

65
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:44,258
As Shakespeare said to Nathan Hale:
I always get my man."

66
00:06:13,954 --> 00:06:15,831
"He always gets his man!"

67
00:06:16,248 --> 00:06:18,709
"That's what I said."
- "He always gets his man!"

68
00:06:19,126 --> 00:06:21,753
"That's what I mean."
- "He always gets his man!"

69
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:27,050
"You're telling me?" - "He always gets
his man!" - "Oh, are you listening?"

70
00:06:29,177 --> 00:06:31,763
"He gets his man! He gets his man!"

71
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,558
"I always get, I always get,

72
00:06:34,975 --> 00:06:38,812
I always get,
I always get, I always get,

73
00:06:39,438 --> 00:06:45,485
I always get my man!"

74
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,783
Splendid, Professor!
- Congratulations! - Thank you.

75
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,705
Marvellous! - Alright scram, boys,
I'll meet you in the barber shop.

76
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,378
Dad, let me congratulate you.
I'm proud to be your son.

77
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:08,758
My boy, you took the words out of my
mouth: I'm ashamed to be your father.

78
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:12,303
You're a disgrace to the family name
Wagstaff, if such a thing is possible.

79
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:15,598
What's this about you fooling around
with the college widow?

80
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:18,977
No wonder you've been 12 years
in the same college!

81
00:07:19,394 --> 00:07:23,106
I went to 3 colleges in 12 years
and fooled around with 3 widows.

82
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:25,650
At your age
I went to bed right after supper.

83
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:30,113
Sometimes before supper. Or I went
without supper, and didn't go to bed.

84
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,866
A college widow stood for something
in those days. She stood for plenty.

85
00:07:34,284 --> 00:07:37,829
There's nothing between me and her.
- Then you're crazy to fool with her.

86
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:41,124
But... - I don't want to talk to you
about this again, you snob!

87
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,836
I'd horsewhip you, if I had a horse.
You may go now.

88
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:49,465
Leave your name with the girl outside.
We'll be in touch with you.

89
00:07:49,882 --> 00:07:52,218
Where are you going?
- You just told me to go.

90
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:55,888
That's what they teach you here?
I tell you to go and you leave me?

91
00:07:56,305 --> 00:07:59,475
You know you can't leave a school-room
without raising your hand.

92
00:07:59,892 --> 00:08:03,145
This school has had a new president
every year since 1888,

93
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:05,398
when we won our last football game.

94
00:08:05,815 --> 00:08:09,151
I like education as well as the next
man... - Then let me talk to him.

95
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:14,031
...but besides education, this
college needs a good football team.

96
00:08:14,448 --> 00:08:19,370
And for a good football team, you need
good football players. - My boy,

97
00:08:19,787 --> 00:08:22,998
I think you've got something. I'll
wait outside until you clean it up.

98
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:27,086
One more question: Where do you get
good football players?

99
00:08:27,503 --> 00:08:29,338
In the speakeasy...
- In a speakeasy?

100
00:08:29,755 --> 00:08:32,633
Isn't that against the law, selling
football players in a speakeasy?

101
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,387
Two of the best players in the country
hang out there.

102
00:08:36,804 --> 00:08:41,308
You suggest that I go there,
without even giving me the address?

103
00:08:41,725 --> 00:08:44,603
42, Elm Street. But you can't
go there, it isn't ethical.

104
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,357
It's not right for a college to buy
football players. - It isn't, eh?

105
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:53,112
Well, come on and we'll have a nip.
Better still, you wait here.

106
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:57,116
Anything further, Father? - "Anything
further, Father?" That can't be right.

107
00:08:57,533 --> 00:09:00,703
Isn't it "Anything Father, further?"
The idea! I married

108
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,957
your mother because I wanted children.
Imagine my disappointment with you!

109
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:13,173
"And I kept yelling since I first
commenced it: I'm against it!"

110
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:26,061
That's my proposition. How about it?

111
00:09:26,478 --> 00:09:29,106
It's OK with us, Mr. Jennings, but

112
00:09:29,523 --> 00:09:32,109
how are you gonna fix it?
- Don't worry, it's fixed already.

113
00:09:32,526 --> 00:09:36,530
You'll be entered as Darwin students
to play in the game against Huxley.

114
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:40,951
Yeah, but how about the dough?
- Here's a little to start with.

115
00:09:41,368 --> 00:09:44,746
You get the balance after the game.
With you boys playing for Darwin,

116
00:09:45,163 --> 00:09:50,377
Huxley can't win. - You said it!
- Here's to dear old Darwin.

117
00:09:51,586 --> 00:09:53,547
Alright boys, let's go.

118
00:09:56,675 --> 00:09:58,885
Bye.
- So long.

119
00:10:00,762 --> 00:10:01,805
Baravelli!

120
00:10:10,772 --> 00:10:11,815
Hello?

121
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:16,236
Yes, lady, this is Baravelli,
the ice man. What do you want?

122
00:10:16,653 --> 00:10:20,156
One quart of scotch,
one quart of rye.

123
00:10:20,573 --> 00:10:23,326
Hold on, I see if I got 'em.

124
00:10:24,744 --> 00:10:27,121
One quart of scotch.

125
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:29,332
One quart of rye.

126
00:10:29,749 --> 00:10:31,876
OK, lady, I send 'em right over.

127
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:44,097
Hey, Baravelli!

128
00:10:50,561 --> 00:10:52,730
What do ya want?
- Watch the door for a few minutes.

129
00:10:53,147 --> 00:10:55,650
And don't let anyone in
without the password.

130
00:10:56,067 --> 00:10:58,611
What is it?
- Swordfish is the password, right?

131
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:01,614
OK, I got it.
- Well, what is it? - Password.

132
00:11:02,031 --> 00:11:05,660
Swordfish! Swordfish.
- Alright, swordfish!

133
00:11:10,998 --> 00:11:15,670
Who are you? - I'm fine. Who are you?
- I'm fine, too. You need a password.

134
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:19,173
Well, what is the password?
- Oh no, you gotta tell me.

135
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,426
I tell what I do,
I give you three guesses.

136
00:11:23,302 --> 00:11:27,223
It's the name of a fish.
- Is it Mary?

137
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,559
That's no fish!
- She isn't? She drinks like one.

138
00:11:30,976 --> 00:11:33,312
Let me see. Is it sturgeon?

139
00:11:33,729 --> 00:11:37,066
You crazy! A sturgeon, he's a doctor,
cuts you open when you sick.

140
00:11:37,483 --> 00:11:40,361
You got one more chance.
- I got it. Haddock.

141
00:11:40,778 --> 00:11:46,617
Funny, I gotta haddock too. - What do
you take? - Sometimes calomel...

142
00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:50,537
I'd walk a mile for a calomel.
- You mean chocolate calomel. Me too.

143
00:11:50,955 --> 00:11:52,915
But you no guess it.

144
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:58,337
Hey, you no understand English?
You only get in if you say swordfish.

145
00:11:58,754 --> 00:12:02,633
Now, I give you one more guess.
- Swordfish... swordfish...

146
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,012
I think I got it. Is it swordfish?
- Ha! That's it! You guess it!

147
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,600
Pretty good, eh?
- Fine, you guess it...

148
00:12:13,644 --> 00:12:17,856
What do you want? - To come in.
- Password? - You don't fool me!

149
00:12:18,273 --> 00:12:22,444
Swordfish. - No, I got tired of that.
I changed it.

150
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,616
What's the password now?
- I forgot it. I better come outside.

151
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:44,758
Buddy, can you help me out?
I'd like to get a cup of coffee.

152
00:12:48,678 --> 00:12:50,764
Hey, here comes my partner.

153
00:12:52,432 --> 00:12:53,475
Hey, Pinky,

154
00:12:53,892 --> 00:12:55,894
do you know the password?

155
00:13:03,902 --> 00:13:07,864
Get up. That's no way to go into
a speakeasy. That's how you come out.

156
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,405
Hey, what'll you have?

157
00:13:50,114 --> 00:13:52,367
He'll take a scotch.
- Right.

158
00:13:52,784 --> 00:13:56,579
I got it! Swordfish.
- Go outside and see if it works.

159
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:27,652
Cut the cards.

160
00:14:32,823 --> 00:14:37,203
Now, to business. I'm looking for two
football players who hang around here.

161
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,206
We hang around here...
- That's all I wanna know.

162
00:14:40,623 --> 00:14:43,751
Prof. Wagstaff from Huxley College.
- That means nothing to me.

163
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:46,837
Means nothing to me, either.
I'll try it over again.

164
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,340
I'm Prof. Huxley
from Wagstaff College.

165
00:14:49,757 --> 00:14:51,800
You didn't stay at the other one long.

166
00:14:52,218 --> 00:14:56,805
Why don't you pull yourself to pieces?
- I'll talk it over with my partner.

167
00:15:43,602 --> 00:15:47,647
In case I never see you again,
what would you want to play football?

168
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:51,193
First we want a football.
- I don't know if we've got one.

169
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:55,197
If we had, would you be interested?
No rush, you can sleep on it.

170
00:15:55,614 --> 00:16:00,577
I no think I can sleep on a football.
- Who's gonna settle for these drinks?

171
00:16:01,703 --> 00:16:07,125
You're stuck. - Can you cash a check
for $15.22? - Sure.

172
00:16:13,965 --> 00:16:17,260
Five, ten, fifteen and twenty-two.

173
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:23,058
As soon as I get the check,
I'll send it to ya. Swordfish!

174
00:16:28,897 --> 00:16:30,899
Laura!
- Good morning, Mr. Wagstaff.

175
00:16:31,316 --> 00:16:34,819
Am I too early? - No, shall I tell
Miss Bailey you're here? - No, I will.

176
00:16:35,236 --> 00:16:38,990
Give me the tray.
Would you open the door?

177
00:16:45,955 --> 00:16:47,707
Your breakfast, Madam. Anything else?

178
00:16:48,124 --> 00:16:52,086
Yes, put some cream in my coffee,
and tell me where you've been.

179
00:16:52,503 --> 00:16:56,841
Busy arguing with Dad about you.
How many? - Two.

180
00:16:57,258 --> 00:17:00,762
Well, what about me?
- Dad wants me to give you up.

181
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:03,389
You're interfering with my studies.

182
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:08,561
He must think I'm terrible.
- I think you're wonderful. Beautiful.

183
00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:12,023
Are you making love to me?
- Why not?

184
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:18,863
"Everyone says I love you, the cop
on the corner and the burglar, too,

185
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:25,119
the preacher in the pulpit and the man
in the pew, says I love you.

186
00:17:27,121 --> 00:17:33,836
Everyone, no matter who,
the folks over 80 and the kid of 2,

187
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:40,259
the captain and the sailor and the
rest of the crew, says I love you.

188
00:17:42,053 --> 00:17:46,223
There are only 8 little letters
in this phrase,

189
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:49,185
you will find,

190
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:56,692
but they mean a lot more
than all the other words combined.

191
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:04,408
Everywhere the whole world through,
the king and the peasant, too,

192
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:10,831
The tiger in the jungle and the monk
in the zoo, says I love you."

193
00:19:14,603 --> 00:19:19,566
Get that crate out of here!
You think this is a picnic?

194
00:19:19,983 --> 00:19:24,612
Blocking traffic, holding up cars...
Who do you think you are?

195
00:19:30,285 --> 00:19:32,537
You know what I'm going to do to you?

196
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:37,083
You're a wise guy, ain't you?
Let go of that club!

197
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,752
You see that badge?

198
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,846
And I say to you, gentlemen,
that this college is a failure.

199
00:20:32,263 --> 00:20:37,560
Trouble is we're neglecting football
for education. - You are right.

200
00:20:37,977 --> 00:20:41,147
No, I'm wrong.
I was just testing you.

201
00:20:41,564 --> 00:20:44,567
Now I know
I'm dealing with a couple of snakes.

202
00:20:44,984 --> 00:20:49,363
There's too much football, and not
enough education. - I think so, too.

203
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,784
Wrong again! If there was a snake here
I'd apologize.

204
00:20:54,201 --> 00:20:56,162
Where would the college be
without football?

205
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:59,206
Have we got a stadium? - Yes.
- And a college? - Yes.

206
00:20:59,623 --> 00:21:03,210
Well, we can't support both.
Start tearing down the college.

207
00:21:03,627 --> 00:21:06,964
But where will the students sleep?
- Same as always. In the classroom.

208
00:21:07,381 --> 00:21:10,593
Professor, the Dean of Science
wants to know when he'll see you.

209
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,387
He said he's tired of
cooling his heels out here.

210
00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:17,016
Tell him
I'm cooling a couple of heels in here.

211
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:20,060
Now, where were we? Oh yes.

212
00:21:21,854 --> 00:21:25,691
How much am I paying you fellas?
- 5,000. But we haven't been paid.

213
00:21:26,108 --> 00:21:31,321
In that case, I'll raise it to 8,000.
And a bonus, for you and your dog.

214
00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:34,992
The Dean's furious. He's waxing wroth!

215
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:38,620
Is Wroth there, too?
Tell him to wax the Dean for a while.

216
00:21:39,037 --> 00:21:42,165
Guess that's bad, eh?
- One more thing, Professor.

217
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,209
It's about your son.

218
00:21:45,002 --> 00:21:48,422
I'm afraid he's paying
too little attention to his studies,

219
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:51,341
and too much to Connie Bailey.

220
00:21:51,758 --> 00:21:54,386
I'll put a stop to that.
I'll call her up right now.

221
00:21:54,886 --> 00:21:59,516
Either of you weasels got her number?
- No. - Good thing I have.

222
00:22:02,144 --> 00:22:05,355
Get me Maine 4-9970
and reverse the charges.

223
00:22:05,772 --> 00:22:09,901
You may go now. Drop this
in the mailbox on your way out.

224
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:15,198
Hello, I want to speak to Miss Bailey.
Is this Miss Bailey?

225
00:22:15,615 --> 00:22:18,952
Why, of course I know your son.

226
00:22:20,662 --> 00:22:24,833
Why, that's silly.
We're just very good friends.

227
00:22:26,209 --> 00:22:28,503
Professor, I don't understand.

228
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,548
You don't? Come over to my office.

229
00:22:31,965 --> 00:22:35,385
You're in bed? In that case,
I'll come to your office.

230
00:22:51,442 --> 00:22:55,905
Where are your tongs?
Looks like a tong war.

231
00:22:57,448 --> 00:22:59,993
No more ice until you pay the bill.

232
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:03,746
How much do we owe you?
- $2,000. - Just for ice?

233
00:23:04,163 --> 00:23:07,000
I can get an Eskimo for $200
and make my own ice.

234
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,473
I tell you what: You owe us 200.
We take 2,000 and call it square.

235
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:27,937
I'll consult my lawyer. If he tells me
to do it, I'll get a new lawyer.

236
00:23:28,354 --> 00:23:32,608
Forget about the money. Go to college,
and get yourself a co-ed.

237
00:23:33,025 --> 00:23:36,988
I gotta co-ed last week for $18,
a co-ed with two pairs of pants.

238
00:23:37,405 --> 00:23:41,284
Since when has a co-ed two pairs
of pants? - Since I joined college.

239
00:23:41,701 --> 00:23:45,371
Baravelli, you've got the brain
of a 4-year-old boy.

240
00:23:45,788 --> 00:23:48,916
Now that you're a college boy,
here's your hat,

241
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,961
your pennant, your coat.

242
00:23:57,925 --> 00:24:01,720
Report for football practice in the
morning. Now, sign this agreement.

243
00:24:02,138 --> 00:24:06,267
There's nothing on this paper.
- We'll fill in something later.

244
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:11,897
Here, put your name on there.
Gee, I didn't know you could write.

245
00:24:12,314 --> 00:24:15,192
Wait a minute, this isn't legal.
There's no seal on it.

246
00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:19,196
Where's the seal?
- Where's the seal?

247
00:24:27,037 --> 00:24:30,165
And thus we see that the function
of the respiratory system

248
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:33,710
is to transmit oxygen
into the bloodstream,

249
00:24:34,128 --> 00:24:36,296
which is called osmosis...

250
00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:39,466
Have they started
sawing a woman in half yet?

251
00:24:39,883 --> 00:24:43,053
Mr President, what a pleasure!
What brings you here?

252
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:47,975
A bicycle, but I left it in the hall.
I brought you two dunces.

253
00:24:48,392 --> 00:24:51,311
Come in, dunces.
Here they are, 10 cents a dunce.

254
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:57,776
Well, all you need now
is a bowl of cherries.

255
00:24:58,193 --> 00:25:01,029
Find yourselves a couple of seats.

256
00:25:09,663 --> 00:25:11,998
Now, let us go on with our lecture.

257
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:14,918
I wish you'd go on
without your lecture.

258
00:25:15,836 --> 00:25:21,216
What do you think of that slide?
- I think he was safe at second.

259
00:25:21,758 --> 00:25:23,385
Now, the circulatory system!

260
00:25:23,927 --> 00:25:26,221
Here is the liver.

261
00:25:26,638 --> 00:25:29,766
What, no bacon?
I'd send that back if I were you.

262
00:25:30,183 --> 00:25:33,561
The liver, if neglected,
invariably leads to cirrhosis

263
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:36,815
You are all familiar
with the symptoms of cirrhosis.

264
00:25:37,232 --> 00:25:39,734
Sure! So roses are red,
so violets are blue,

265
00:25:40,151 --> 00:25:42,195
so sugar is sweet,
so so are you.

266
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:45,073
I bet I know who it is.

267
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:48,368
To protect the heart, or cardium,

268
00:25:48,785 --> 00:25:52,539
Mother Nature has provided a sac,
called the pericardium.

269
00:25:52,956 --> 00:25:54,124
Any questions?

270
00:25:54,165 --> 00:25:57,001
Yes. When you gonna
cut the watermelon open?

271
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:02,924
Psychopathically,
the duodenum is in inverse ratio

272
00:26:03,341 --> 00:26:05,843
to the coordination of the palyphus.

273
00:26:06,261 --> 00:26:10,974
Is this stuff on the level, or are you
just making it up as you go along?

274
00:26:11,391 --> 00:26:14,727
Why, everything I told you can be
found in the simplest anatomy book.

275
00:26:15,144 --> 00:26:18,731
I'm sure my students will bear me out.
- We'll bear you out.

276
00:26:24,737 --> 00:26:26,823
Let that be a lesson to all of you.

277
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,742
This school
will be here long after you're gone.

278
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,078
That goes for you, too.

279
00:26:43,214 --> 00:26:45,549
Leave me alone!

280
00:26:50,387 --> 00:26:53,890
Let us follow a corpuscle
on its journey.

281
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:57,185
Oh, my mistake,
I thought I was a corpuscle.

282
00:26:57,602 --> 00:27:00,814
There is constant warfare
between the red and white corpuscles.

283
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:04,692
Now, baboons, what is a corpuscle?
- That's easy.

284
00:27:05,235 --> 00:27:08,738
There's a captain, then a lieutenant,
then there's a corpuscle.

285
00:27:09,364 --> 00:27:14,327
That's fine. Why don't you bore a hole
in yourself and let the sap run out.

286
00:27:15,578 --> 00:27:20,792
We now find ourselves among the Alps,
simple people who eat rice and shoes.

287
00:27:21,209 --> 00:27:25,254
Beyond are more Alps, and the Lord
Alps those who Alp themselves.

288
00:27:25,672 --> 00:27:29,008
The blood rushes from the head to the
feet, gets a look at those feet,

289
00:27:29,425 --> 00:27:31,552
and rushes back to the head again.

290
00:27:31,969 --> 00:27:34,722
This is known as auction pinochle.

291
00:27:35,348 --> 00:27:39,435
We first listen to your hearts beat,
and if your hearts beat anything

292
00:27:39,852 --> 00:27:43,022
but diamonds and clubs, your partner
is cheating. Or your wife.

293
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,317
Now take this point, for instance...

294
00:27:48,152 --> 00:27:50,488
That reminds me. Where's my son?

295
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:54,534
Well, the human body
takes many strange forms.

296
00:27:54,951 --> 00:27:56,827
Now, here is a most unusual organ.

297
00:27:57,245 --> 00:28:00,498
The organ will play a solo
immediately after the feature picture.

298
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:05,086
Scientists examine rats, or
your landlord who won't cut the rent.

299
00:28:05,503 --> 00:28:07,421
And what do they find? Asparagus.

300
00:28:07,922 --> 00:28:10,049
Now, on closer examination...

301
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,552
This needs closer examination.

302
00:28:13,969 --> 00:28:15,721
In fact, it needs a nightgown.

303
00:28:16,138 --> 00:28:18,682
Baravelli, who did this?
Is this your picture?

304
00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:21,519
It doesn't look like me.
- Well, take it away

305
00:28:21,936 --> 00:28:25,981
and hang it in my bedroom.
Now, who did it?

306
00:28:27,316 --> 00:28:29,276
So you're the culprit.

307
00:28:29,693 --> 00:28:32,905
Young man, you can't
burn the candle at both ends.

308
00:28:36,283 --> 00:28:39,453
Well, I was wrong.
I thought it was a candle.

309
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:42,790
Well, you must be punished.
You stay after school.

310
00:28:43,207 --> 00:28:45,042
But I didn't do anything.

311
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:49,129
I know, but there's no fun
keeping him after school.

312
00:28:49,671 --> 00:28:51,757
Now, we'll have no more interruptions.

313
00:28:52,508 --> 00:28:56,887
According to von Steinmetz,
the eminent physiologist, a group of

314
00:28:57,304 --> 00:28:58,305
phagocytes...

315
00:29:03,936 --> 00:29:07,022
According to von Steinmetz,
the eminent physiologist, a group of

316
00:29:07,439 --> 00:29:08,482
er, phagocytes...

317
00:29:13,528 --> 00:29:15,322
According to von...

318
00:29:15,822 --> 00:29:17,407
According to von Steinmetz...

319
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:25,707
According to von Steinmetz, a group
of white phagocytes is present.

320
00:29:27,626 --> 00:29:33,006
And they are essential
to prolonging life.

321
00:29:34,925 --> 00:29:37,928
My left wing has been turned,
my rear end has been cut off.

322
00:29:38,345 --> 00:29:43,058
But I'll fight it out on these lines...
They got me!

323
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:52,567
Hello.

324
00:29:52,984 --> 00:29:55,111
Oh, it's you, Frank.

325
00:29:56,821 --> 00:29:59,741
Why, of course,
I'd love to have you come over.

326
00:30:00,158 --> 00:30:02,869
Alright, I'll be expecting you then.

327
00:30:03,286 --> 00:30:05,330
Goodbye, darling.

328
00:30:05,747 --> 00:30:09,959
Who are you calling "darling"?
- Frank Wagstaff, the professor's son.

329
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:14,672
I didn't tell you to fall for him,
just to find out about his team.

330
00:30:15,089 --> 00:30:17,175
He says Huxley will win.

331
00:30:17,592 --> 00:30:21,763
I've got my bankroll bet on Darwin,
and I'm taking no chances.

332
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,515
Before the game starts
I'll have the Huxley signals.

333
00:30:24,933 --> 00:30:27,852
Down the hatch and on my way.

334
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,274
See you later.

335
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:36,402
Bye, dear.

336
00:30:52,418 --> 00:30:56,005
Are you still here.
- I just came in.

337
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:02,011
What do you mean, am I still here?
- I mean, are you hear already?

338
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:06,432
I shouldn't be here. The old man
gave me a terrible bawling out.

339
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:10,853
Don't worry about him,
he'll never know you were here.

340
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:15,149
How about a little drink?
- Alright, I'll get you one. - Please!

341
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,800
Are you Miss Bailey?

342
00:31:34,217 --> 00:31:37,803
Come, come, one of us is!
- I'm Miss Bailey, and who are you?

343
00:31:38,221 --> 00:31:41,098
I'm Prof. Wagstoff. Who are you?
- Miss Bailey!

344
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:44,769
Then you are Miss Bailey.
Thought you could fool me.

345
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:47,230
You've got to give my son up.
- Give him up?

346
00:31:47,647 --> 00:31:52,151
He's all I've got, apart from
a picture of George Washington.

347
00:31:52,568 --> 00:31:57,198
But... - Lies! He's a shell of his
former self, which nobody can deny.

348
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:59,950
I tell you you're ruining him.

349
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:04,246
Did he tell you that you have
beautiful eyes? - Why, yes.

350
00:32:04,663 --> 00:32:06,832
Told me that, too. Tells everyone!

351
00:32:07,249 --> 00:32:11,295
I could sit on your lap all day
if you didn't stand up.

352
00:32:11,921 --> 00:32:14,798
Quick, get out! That door.

353
00:32:22,765 --> 00:32:25,059
I don't want any ice.

354
00:32:37,905 --> 00:32:42,367
Who was that? - The ice man.
- You can't pull the wool over my ice.

355
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,287
The ice man leaves me cold.

356
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:48,040
Here you are...
- So, I caught you at last.

357
00:32:48,457 --> 00:32:51,919
You are fooling around with her.
Oh, the shame of it.

358
00:32:52,336 --> 00:32:56,423
A son taking a dame from his father.
- Dad... - Enough, get out of here!

359
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,678
I'll settle with this woman, then
we'll have you to dinner. Let's go.

360
00:33:02,095 --> 00:33:03,472
Follow me.

361
00:33:09,728 --> 00:33:12,606
Be a lamp in the window
for my wandering boy.

362
00:33:14,608 --> 00:33:16,651
Where were we?
Oh yes, I was on your lap.

363
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:19,738
And doing pretty well, as I recall it.

364
00:33:21,782 --> 00:33:24,451
Hurry, get out! Hurry!

365
00:33:25,076 --> 00:33:29,331
And remember, stay undercover.
- I've more students in the college.

366
00:33:32,918 --> 00:33:34,127
You dropped your ice.

367
00:33:34,544 --> 00:33:37,631
I don't want any ice!
- Neither do I.

368
00:33:42,552 --> 00:33:44,638
Now do you want any ice?
- No!

369
00:33:45,055 --> 00:33:47,182
Oh, you're beautiful.

370
00:33:50,477 --> 00:33:54,731
You're overcoming me.
- Thanks for reminding me.

371
00:33:55,148 --> 00:33:58,026
I like you. You got something.

372
00:33:58,443 --> 00:34:00,737
I'm gonna tell him he's crazy.

373
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,156
Professor, what are you doing here?

374
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:15,783
Nothing, since you came in.

375
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,746
You know him?
- He put me on the football team.

376
00:34:20,163 --> 00:34:23,207
Now I just have to get him
off the couch.

377
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,835
Read any good books lately?

378
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,184
This must be the main highway.

379
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:46,939
Follow me,
I've been doing this all day.

380
00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:55,323
Pretty popular place. - Yeah,
a hot dog stand would clean up.

381
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:59,660
What are you doing here?
- Me? I'm the music teacher.

382
00:35:00,077 --> 00:35:02,413
Since when?
- Since you came in.

383
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:06,709
And you? - I'm the plumber. In case
something goes wrong with her pipes.

384
00:35:07,126 --> 00:35:09,044
I haven't used that joke for 20 years.

385
00:35:09,462 --> 00:35:12,131
Take a deep breath and follow me.

386
00:35:24,268 --> 00:35:27,104
Cosy place we have here.

387
00:35:36,196 --> 00:35:38,782
You sing high, eh?
- I have a falsetto voice.

388
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:41,744
My last pupil,
she gotta false set of teeth.

389
00:35:42,161 --> 00:35:44,288
So maybe it's better you don't sing.

390
00:35:44,705 --> 00:35:47,374
That's much better. I'll sing.

391
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:50,002
"Everyone says I love you,

392
00:35:50,419 --> 00:35:52,754
the big mosquito when he sting you,

393
00:35:53,172 --> 00:35:57,467
the fly when he's stuck on
the fly paper, too, says I love you.

394
00:35:58,844 --> 00:36:03,307
Every time the cow says "moo",
she's making the bull very happy too,

395
00:36:03,724 --> 00:36:08,937
and the rooster when he holler
cock-a-doodly-doo, says I love you.

396
00:36:09,688 --> 00:36:14,609
Christopher Columbo, he write
the Queen of Spain a nice little note,

397
00:36:15,027 --> 00:36:20,574
he say how I love you, then he get
a great big boat. He's a wise guy.

398
00:36:20,991 --> 00:36:26,037
What you think Columbo do,
when he's coming here in 1492,

399
00:36:26,455 --> 00:36:32,043
He says to Pocahontas, atch-a catchy
coo, which means I love you!"

400
00:36:32,961 --> 00:36:36,339
Maybe it's better I don't sing, too.
- Yes. - Alright, I'll play.

401
00:36:37,924 --> 00:36:43,096
I love good music. - So do I,
let's get out of here. - Sit down.

402
00:36:43,722 --> 00:36:49,144
I've got to stay here. But you folks
can go into the lobby till it's over.

403
00:37:58,588 --> 00:38:02,550
Well, that's all for the first lesson.
Next week I teach you how to breathe.

404
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:04,969
Don't breathe before then.

405
00:38:06,095 --> 00:38:08,597
If this is a singing lesson,
I'm a ring-tailed monkey.

406
00:38:09,015 --> 00:38:11,809
Keep your family out of it. Baravelli!
- What?

407
00:38:12,226 --> 00:38:14,603
Are you going my way? - Yes.
- Then I'm staying here.

408
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:20,484
No you don't. And if I find you here
again, it'll be curtains.

409
00:38:22,695 --> 00:38:24,697
Tell my son to take that lamp down.

410
00:38:36,124 --> 00:38:37,125
Dad!

411
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:39,711
You've got the wrong football players.
- The whole team?

412
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:43,172
No, Baravelli and the dog catcher.

413
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:46,718
But I got them in the speakeasy.
- You got the wrong ones.

414
00:38:47,135 --> 00:38:50,972
The ones I told you about are playing
for Darwin. - Send for Baravelli.

415
00:38:51,389 --> 00:38:54,892
Don't leave a stone unturned.
He's probably under one.

416
00:39:00,189 --> 00:39:01,524
Baravelli!

417
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:07,822
...2671, 57, 84, 59, 71...

418
00:39:09,907 --> 00:39:13,786
What are you doing in there?
- I'm practising secret signals.

419
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,123
Come on out.

420
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,751
What do you want? - You can fix it
for our team to win. - Oh no,

421
00:39:21,168 --> 00:39:26,215
I want to play. - Alright, but listen.
I want two Darwin players kidnapped.

422
00:39:26,632 --> 00:39:30,886
Have you any experience in kidnapping?
- You bet. You know what I do?

423
00:39:31,303 --> 00:39:34,140
First I call them up,
then I send them my chauffeur.

424
00:39:34,557 --> 00:39:36,642
What kind of a car you got?

425
00:39:37,059 --> 00:39:39,478
I no got a car, just a chauffeur.

426
00:39:39,895 --> 00:39:43,107
But when you have a chauffeur,
aren't you supposed to have a car?

427
00:39:43,524 --> 00:39:48,404
Well, I had, but it cost too much,
so I sold the car.

428
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:51,699
I would have kept the car.

429
00:39:52,116 --> 00:39:55,786
I gotta have a chauffeur
to take me to work in the morning.

430
00:39:56,203 --> 00:39:58,163
How can he take you to work?

431
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,791
He don't have to. I no gotta job.

432
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:06,505
That's it. How much would you want
to stand in front of a firing squad?

433
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:13,345
Now just a minute, boys.
I didn't come here to fight.

434
00:40:13,887 --> 00:40:17,224
You have to, I've taken my coat off.
- I wanna talk to Baravelli.

435
00:40:17,641 --> 00:40:19,059
You wouldn't mind stepping out?

436
00:40:19,977 --> 00:40:22,229
I'd love to,
but I have to see the girl first.

437
00:40:22,646 --> 00:40:26,775
I've got a proposition. - Watch out,
he's nearly as crooked as you.

438
00:40:27,651 --> 00:40:29,319
Let's go in here.

439
00:40:34,449 --> 00:40:37,160
I want you to do something for me.
- I'm busy.

440
00:40:37,577 --> 00:40:41,123
We gotta kidnap a couple of players
from the Darwin team.

441
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:44,626
Is that so?
You don't mean McHardie and Mullen?

442
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:48,630
Sounds like it. But the fellas I mean
are Mullen and McHardie.

443
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:53,760
Let me give you a tip.
The boys live at 39 Hanley Street.

444
00:40:54,177 --> 00:40:57,305
Thanks! - Now, I want you
to do something for me.

445
00:40:57,722 --> 00:41:00,016
What do you want?
- Listen,

446
00:41:00,433 --> 00:41:04,187
give me the signals,
and this 500 bucks is yours.

447
00:41:04,604 --> 00:41:05,647
Alright.

448
00:41:06,648 --> 00:41:08,650
Here's the signals.

449
00:41:10,527 --> 00:41:13,238
Want a minute,
these are Darwin's signals.

450
00:41:13,655 --> 00:41:16,241
You think I'd give you 500 dollars
for Darwin's signals?

451
00:41:16,658 --> 00:41:20,245
They cost me 200.
I gotta make a little profit.

452
00:44:47,742 --> 00:44:50,536
Listen, you gotta get busy
and get those football signals.

453
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:55,958
I thought you were going to get them.
- I wouldn't be asking you then.

454
00:44:56,376 --> 00:45:00,713
You just have to get to the professor.
He's got the Huxley signals.

455
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:04,050
And I'm depending on you to get them.

456
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:08,054
Yes, but how?
- You know how.

457
00:45:08,471 --> 00:45:11,015
Romance him, baby, romance him.

458
00:45:11,432 --> 00:45:15,978
And remember, all you're to get
is the football signals.

459
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:35,206
"Everyone says I love you,

460
00:45:35,623 --> 00:45:39,418
but just what they say it for,
I never knew,

461
00:45:39,835 --> 00:45:46,509
it's just inviting trouble for
the poor sucker who says I love you.

462
00:45:48,844 --> 00:45:52,515
Take a pair of rabbits who

463
00:45:52,932 --> 00:45:56,852
get stuck on each other
and begin to woo,

464
00:45:57,269 --> 00:46:04,818
and pretty soon you find a million
more rabbits who say I love you.

465
00:46:06,195 --> 00:46:14,495
When a lion gets feeling frisky
and begins to roar,

466
00:46:14,912 --> 00:46:23,045
there's another lion who knows
just what he's roaring for.

467
00:46:23,462 --> 00:46:31,428
Everything that ever grew, the goose
and the gander and the gosling too,

468
00:46:31,845 --> 00:46:36,934
the duck upon the water,
when he feels that way too, says..."

469
00:46:38,602 --> 00:46:41,271
That's a wise quack.
You keep your bill out of this.

470
00:46:41,688 --> 00:46:44,775
How would you like it
if I butted into your affairs?

471
00:46:51,531 --> 00:46:54,868
This is my first time in a canoe
since I saw "The American Tragedy."

472
00:46:55,285 --> 00:46:58,163
You're perfectly safe, Professor,
in this boat.

473
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:01,833
I was going to get a flat bottom,
but the boat girl didn't have one.

474
00:47:02,417 --> 00:47:07,839
I could go on like this
drifting and dreaming for ever.

475
00:47:08,256 --> 00:47:10,508
What a day. Spring in the air!

476
00:47:10,926 --> 00:47:13,762
Who, me? And fall in the lake?

477
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:16,473
Professor, you're full of whimsy.

478
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:21,645
Can you tell from there?
I'm always like that after radishes.

479
00:47:26,149 --> 00:47:29,444
Is that important?
- Is it important?

480
00:47:30,153 --> 00:47:32,113
Those are the football signals.

481
00:47:32,822 --> 00:47:35,116
I've got a duplicate in my pocket.

482
00:47:35,533 --> 00:47:39,537
I always carry two of everything.
This is my first date with one woman.

483
00:47:39,954 --> 00:47:42,790
You mean
you take two girls out every time?

484
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:46,544
I hate to see a girl walk home alone.

485
00:47:46,961 --> 00:47:50,632
You know, Professor,
I've never seen football signals.

486
00:47:51,049 --> 00:47:54,594
You think a little girl like me
could understand them?

487
00:47:55,011 --> 00:47:57,680
I think you could understand anything.

488
00:47:58,097 --> 00:48:01,059
Is the big stwong man
gonna show liddle icky baby

489
00:48:01,476 --> 00:48:04,354
all about the bad football signals?

490
00:48:05,396 --> 00:48:09,400
Was that you or the duck?
If it was you, I'm with the duck.

491
00:48:09,817 --> 00:48:12,612
If icky baby don't learn
about the football signals,

492
00:48:13,029 --> 00:48:15,156
icky baby gonna cry.

493
00:48:15,573 --> 00:48:17,325
If icky girl keep talking that way,

494
00:48:17,742 --> 00:48:21,996
big stwong man
gonna kick all her teef in.

495
00:48:22,413 --> 00:48:24,498
Naughty man is only fooling!

496
00:48:24,916 --> 00:48:27,460
Just for that I'm coming over

497
00:48:27,877 --> 00:48:32,173
to smother him in kisses.
- You couldn't make that onions?

498
00:48:34,884 --> 00:48:37,720
Oh, so that's your game.

499
00:48:40,097 --> 00:48:43,100
Professor Wagstaff!

500
00:48:43,517 --> 00:48:47,146
Just call me Quincy.
And later you can call me Quince.

501
00:48:47,563 --> 00:48:50,566
Throw me the lifesaver!

502
00:48:51,484 --> 00:48:54,111
Please hurry, Professor.

503
00:49:02,328 --> 00:49:04,288
39. This is it!

504
00:49:11,545 --> 00:49:14,590
Hello. Yeah, this is McHardie.

505
00:49:16,383 --> 00:49:18,302
So they're coming right over?

506
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:21,138
OK, we'll take care of them.

507
00:49:21,889 --> 00:49:26,310
Jennings says Baravelli and the dog
catcher are coming to kidnap us

508
00:49:26,727 --> 00:49:29,188
to keep us out of the game.

509
00:49:33,692 --> 00:49:36,737
This is the place.
Now how we gonna catch 'em?

510
00:49:37,362 --> 00:49:40,282
No, that's for flies.
Baseball players catch flies.

511
00:49:40,699 --> 00:49:43,493
We look for football players.
You bring the tools?

512
00:49:43,911 --> 00:49:47,831
You got the shovel, the axe
and the pick? Where's the pick?

513
00:49:48,457 --> 00:49:51,084
No, that's no pick. That's a hog.

514
00:49:51,501 --> 00:49:53,754
Don't you know what a hog is?

515
00:49:54,171 --> 00:49:57,924
Oh, come on, let's get busy.
We gotta kidnap those players.

516
00:50:01,136 --> 00:50:02,763
Mullen und McHardie?

517
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:06,433
That's us. What can we do for you?
- You got a brother?

518
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:09,436
No.
- You got a sister? - Yeah.

519
00:50:09,853 --> 00:50:12,397
She's a very sick man.
You better come with us.

520
00:50:12,981 --> 00:50:15,150
What happened to her?

521
00:50:15,567 --> 00:50:17,319
She crash her automobile.

522
00:50:17,736 --> 00:50:21,948
She has no automobile. - Then she fell
off a horse. We drive you there.

523
00:50:22,365 --> 00:50:25,410
You will? I have no sister.

524
00:50:25,827 --> 00:50:29,122
That's alright.
We gotta no car. Come on.

525
00:50:29,539 --> 00:50:32,334
You think
you're gonna take us for a ride?

526
00:50:32,751 --> 00:50:35,712
This is gonna take a long time.

527
00:50:37,797 --> 00:50:39,883
Try one at a time.

528
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:47,849
Odin't work, eh?

529
00:50:48,892 --> 00:50:50,560
Get tough.

530
00:50:52,562 --> 00:50:54,606
Get tough with the other one.

531
00:50:56,566 --> 00:50:58,484
Get tough with both of them.

532
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:00,486
Tougher!

533
00:51:12,749 --> 00:51:15,626
Now you're getting someplace.

534
00:51:21,007 --> 00:51:23,384
You better think of something else.

535
00:51:27,847 --> 00:51:30,516
I'm exhausted, too.

536
00:51:31,517 --> 00:51:34,520
Maybe you fellas got an idea?
- I'll say we do.

537
00:51:34,979 --> 00:51:37,064
Where's that rope, Ed?

538
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:38,983
Get 'em, Ed!

539
00:51:50,327 --> 00:51:53,497
Hey guys, we'll let you know
how the game comes out.

540
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:57,418
Now they've kidnapped us!

541
00:51:57,835 --> 00:52:00,963
That's a fix-a fine we're in.
How we gonna get out?

542
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,757
I got an idea. You got a rope?

543
00:52:05,718 --> 00:52:09,054
That's fine. Tie on the bed,
throw the rope out the window.

544
00:52:09,471 --> 00:52:12,433
Tie on the bed,
throw the rope out the window.

545
00:52:14,935 --> 00:52:16,353
Hey!

546
00:52:17,229 --> 00:52:20,482
What you do? You no tie on the bed.

547
00:52:20,899 --> 00:52:23,152
No, I mean a-tie the rope.

548
00:52:23,569 --> 00:52:25,654
Now what you gonna do?

549
00:52:30,033 --> 00:52:33,620
You crazy! That's a-no good.
How we gonna get out?

550
00:52:35,664 --> 00:52:38,000
You wanna break-a my neck?

551
00:52:40,294 --> 00:52:44,172
Don't worry, Mr. Jennings,
everything's working out fine.

552
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:49,011
Alright. That game's in the bag.
See ya later.

553
00:52:51,221 --> 00:52:54,850
Wonder what the two mugs
are doing up there?

554
00:53:29,217 --> 00:53:33,930
Our little playmates,
just in time for a cup of tea.

555
00:53:34,347 --> 00:53:39,477
We got no cups. See ya after the game.
Come on, Pinky. - No yuh don't!

556
00:53:41,479 --> 00:53:46,401
Take off your coat. Come on.
Off with your shirt.

557
00:53:46,818 --> 00:53:48,695
Quit stallin'.

558
00:53:49,154 --> 00:53:52,115
Now take off your pants.
- I got a date, nothing doing.

559
00:54:10,425 --> 00:54:11,676
You too!

560
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:14,721
Take that coat off.

561
00:54:16,597 --> 00:54:20,601
Stand over there, you.
Come on, Ed, let's take their clothes.

562
00:54:26,691 --> 00:54:27,525
So,

563
00:54:27,942 --> 00:54:31,279
if you boys'll excuse us,
we'll run along and play football.

564
00:54:31,696 --> 00:54:35,700
Tune in on the radio if you
want to know how the game's going.

565
00:54:38,244 --> 00:54:41,455
I'll send my sister over
to keep you company.

566
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,754
Gee, I guess it's locked.

567
00:55:10,442 --> 00:55:12,027
Boy, what a pretty play.

568
00:55:12,444 --> 00:55:16,282
Darwin's just got a fourth touchdown
and the crowd is going wild.

569
00:55:16,699 --> 00:55:19,702
There seems to be no stopping
Mullen and McHardie.

570
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:22,121
Two minutes left to play
in the first quarter,

571
00:55:22,538 --> 00:55:26,041
and what a lacing
the Huxley team is getting.

572
00:55:32,047 --> 00:55:34,425
HcHardie has the ball
and he's breaking through.

573
00:55:44,893 --> 00:55:47,229
I guess we made a grand slam.

574
00:56:25,273 --> 00:56:26,983
Pinky, hurry up.

575
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,695
Come on, we still got time to play.

576
00:56:35,283 --> 00:56:39,120
Fine kidnappers you are. The fellas
you kidnapped were here before you.

577
00:56:39,537 --> 00:56:42,582
Look: 12 to nothing.
Fat lot you care.

578
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:47,170
Know what it means if Huxley loses?
Shame, disgrace, humiliation!

579
00:56:47,587 --> 00:56:50,924
And you're crazy if you don't
play the ace. Come on, fight!

580
00:56:51,799 --> 00:56:54,844
No, no, no, no! Get in that game!

581
00:56:57,764 --> 00:56:59,849
Listen, you butter-fingered milksops!

582
00:57:00,266 --> 00:57:04,270
The way you're playing, you couldn't
beat a girls' basketball team.

583
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:08,024
We're going to have to use
our star play No. 37,

584
00:57:08,441 --> 00:57:12,111
where the quarterback makes
a lateral pass to the right guard...

585
00:57:12,528 --> 00:57:15,698
Dad! - Wait a minute! Boys,
if you can't beat that bunch of...

586
00:57:16,115 --> 00:57:18,659
Dad! - What do you want?
- You're talking to the wrong team.

587
00:57:19,076 --> 00:57:22,538
I know I am,
but our team wouldn't listen to me.

588
00:57:25,416 --> 00:57:29,921
Which way you going? - Out there.
- Drop me off at the 40-yard line.

589
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,469
Where's your number?

590
00:57:41,932 --> 00:57:47,021
Boy, play like you did last time.
I bet five dollars on the other team.

591
00:58:03,412 --> 00:58:05,497
Ready?
- OK.

592
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:07,374
Let's go!

593
00:58:15,507 --> 00:58:17,259
Here comes Prof. Wagstaff.

594
00:58:17,676 --> 00:58:19,595
Will you say something?
- I will if you get up.

595
00:58:20,012 --> 00:58:23,974
Professor Wagstaff will tell you
all about the game.

596
00:58:24,391 --> 00:58:28,645
Some football game. I wish
you were here. Instead of me.

597
00:58:29,063 --> 00:58:32,441
Last week, I told you Mrs. Moskowitz
was expecting a blessed event.

598
00:58:32,858 --> 00:58:37,112
Last night Mrs Moskowitz had twins.
OK, Mr. Moskowitz!

599
00:58:38,614 --> 00:58:40,949
Thank you, Professor.
- It was nothing at all.

600
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:54,463
The boys are back in the field,
they're lined up,

601
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,798
Huxley is about to kick off,

602
00:58:57,215 --> 00:58:59,176
and there they go!

603
00:59:17,618 --> 00:59:18,744
Pardon me.

604
00:59:32,842 --> 00:59:35,928
That'll teach him to pass a lady
without tipping his hat.

605
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:50,776
Hey, you wanna get hurt?
We're gonna throw a forward pass.

606
00:59:51,193 --> 00:59:57,449
Signal: 18, 72, forward pass,
eenie, meenie, miney, mo.

607
01:00:02,913 --> 01:00:05,499
Pinky, what are you doing here?

608
01:00:08,252 --> 01:00:11,421
That tackle will cost you 15 yards.

609
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:15,050
You're supposed to tackle
the man with the ball, understand?

610
01:00:20,097 --> 01:00:22,140
Hey, idiot, where's that ball?

611
01:00:22,558 --> 01:00:25,936
Look, he's got the mumps.
- Give me that ball.

612
01:00:26,353 --> 01:00:27,688
Give me it.

613
01:00:39,658 --> 01:00:44,496
Ain't deaf over there.
- Signal: 18, 42, 56 and run. Hup!

614
01:00:50,752 --> 01:00:52,212
Bring that back!

615
01:01:14,776 --> 01:01:18,405
Signal: 85, 29, 78. Hup!

616
01:01:29,874 --> 01:01:31,793
Come on, boys.

617
01:01:33,002 --> 01:01:36,756
Jumping anaconda!
Is there a doctor in the stands?

618
01:01:37,173 --> 01:01:40,718
Yes, I'm a doctor.
- How do you like the game, doc?

619
01:01:49,394 --> 01:01:51,896
Come back for me in five minutes.

620
01:01:55,858 --> 01:01:59,862
Fancy seeing you here.
It's a small world after all.

621
01:02:09,247 --> 01:02:11,165
Why weren't you in the last scrimmage?

622
01:02:11,582 --> 01:02:14,794
I'm sitting this one out.
- What are you doing with that cigar?

623
01:02:15,211 --> 01:02:19,173
You know another way to smoke it?
- Get on your feet.

624
01:02:21,008 --> 01:02:24,220
Don't look now,
but I think I see the chemistry prof.

625
01:02:24,637 --> 01:02:26,764
Up there with the janitor's wife.

626
01:02:28,182 --> 01:02:30,059
Here, have a cigar.

627
01:02:33,813 --> 01:02:34,647
Signal.

628
01:02:35,064 --> 01:02:38,859
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
Professor Wagstaff gets the ball.

629
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:56,252
Have you got it, boys?
- OK!

630
01:03:00,297 --> 01:03:02,341
Hey, bring that ball in here.

631
01:03:16,188 --> 01:03:17,815
There goes the ball.

632
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:26,156
Go on, Pinky. Make a home run.

633
01:03:34,623 --> 01:03:40,253
Gee, Pinky, you made a touchdown.
Are you tired? That's marvellous.

634
01:04:07,239 --> 01:04:10,909
I forgot your phone number.
- Where's that ball?

635
01:04:13,536 --> 01:04:15,080
Here it is. Come on,

636
01:04:15,497 --> 01:04:18,333
get off that ball.
You're holding up the game.

637
01:04:26,716 --> 01:04:32,263
Signal: Uno, duo, tre, vendi,
this-a time we go left endi.

638
01:04:48,404 --> 01:04:50,239
Nice work, Pinky.

639
01:04:56,621 --> 01:04:59,499
Signal: Hi diddle diddle,
the cat and the fiddle,

640
01:04:59,916 --> 01:05:03,127
this time I think
we go through the middle.

641
01:05:14,805 --> 01:05:16,724
Hey, you're running the wrong way.

642
01:05:47,546 --> 01:05:54,887
We are gathered together here to join
this man and this woman in matrimony.

643
01:05:55,304 --> 01:05:59,808
Do you take this man to be
your lawful wedded husband? - I do.
