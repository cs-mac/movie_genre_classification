1
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,300
Oh, I'm terribly sorry

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,600
I didn't see you there

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,000
How may I help you?

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,200
Uh, I'm looking for, uh, Carl Sack

5
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:24,100
I'm Carl Sack

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,600
You're Carl Sack?

7
00:00:25,635 --> 00:00:26,900
At your service

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,065
Full service

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,500
Um, I've seen photographs of Mr Sack
and

10
00:00:30,535 --> 00:00:32,900
I look shorter in person
and fatter and

11
00:00:32,935 --> 00:00:33,800
Hello, Denny

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:35,865
I'm Carl Sack

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:36,965
He's got the mad cow

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,300
- I'm Jenny Pratt
- It makes him think he's Carl

15
00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:40,300
Yes Um, let's go to my office

16
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,000
There were a dozen eyewitnesses,
and they all tell the same story

18
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,300
Dwayne Willis was brought in a little
before 9:00 p m

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,266
They strapped him down
on the table

20
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:02,176
and hooked up the
two IVs, one in each arm

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,200
The first drug is supposed to render
the condemned man unconscious

22
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,600
It didn't

23
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,600
It was now 10 past 9:00

24
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,000
The drugs had been going into him
for nearly ten minutes

25
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,500
That's when officer Holt started
getting worried More time goes by

26
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,400
Willis has been hooked up to the drip
for 20 minutes now

27
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,100
He's still conscious

28
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,065
An argument breaks out

29
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,500
The tech wants to pull the IVs out
and try again

30
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:32,900
Another guard says no,
just increase the dosage

31
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,100
Then Willis starts thrashing around

32
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,800
His chest is heaving ,He is
gasping, choking It's horrifying

33
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,200
And Holt says, "do something"
but nobody knows what to do

34
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,300
Willis has been hooked up
for a half-hour now

35
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,365
He's not even unconscious

36
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,300
He's gagging and thrashing,
and that's when Holt just snapped

37
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,600
I don't know!

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,400
He fired one round into Willis' head

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,700
Willis died instantly

40
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,565
He's charged with murder two,

41
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,900
but the DA is willing to knock it
down to manslaughter,

42
00:02:17,935 --> 00:02:19,900
only Holt won't take the deal

43
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,865
- Ms Pratt
- Jenny

44
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,600
There must be many lawyers in Virginia
who could do this

45
00:02:24,635 --> 00:02:25,765
Yeah, I need an advocate

46
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,850
who can speak forcefully against
the death penalty itself

47
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:31,900
Jenny, whatever one's feelings
are on the death penalty

48
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:32,900
For it

49
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,500
It's moot here

50
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,465
Your client

51
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,000
carried out a death sentence,
albeit in a unique fashion

52
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,865
But the legal issue is also unique

53
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,900
I mean, is it even possible
to murder a man who's being executed?

54
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:46,600
Double homicide Happens all the time

55
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
A double homicide is when two people
are killed, Denny

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,900
What's your point?

57
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,365
Listen, Jenny, I'm not s

58
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,100
Carl, Virginia is a swing state,
and I've always wanted to swing

59
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,000
- Denny
- Carl, we need to bond

60
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,165
Hell, man, this is our last season

61
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,400
If there's one thing I've learned in life,
it's never, ever say no to a road trip

62
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,400
I just couldn't watch him
suffer anymore

63
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,600
If I had to do it over again,
I'd do the same thing

64
00:04:08,635 --> 00:04:10,200
You only fired the one shot?

65
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,200
Yes

66
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,665
We could go with defense of others,

67
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,400
but since you went into the room
to participate in executing the man,

68
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:19,600
- I don't think that
- I didn't go in to torture him

69
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,100
Another approach, uh, would be
a version of diminished capacity

70
00:04:25,135 --> 00:04:26,900
You were overcome with compassion

71
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:27,900
In Virginia?

72
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,200
Moreover, your years of witnessing
executions could have taken a mental toll

73
00:04:33,235 --> 00:04:34,900
I'm not arguing that

74
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:38,100
Um, how about

75
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,200
simple temporary insanity? You saw
a man suffering You snapped You w

76
00:04:42,235 --> 00:04:45,800
No! I knew exactly what I did
while I was doing it

77
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:47,300
I'd do it again

78
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,800
We don't have a lot to go with here

79
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,000
I won't say I was insane

80
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,000
You want us to just cut him loose?

81
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,000
You make it sound as if he's strung
up somewhere

82
00:05:17,035 --> 00:05:18,667
Let's not get ahead of ourselves

83
00:05:18,702 --> 00:05:20,265
Mr Sack, uh, you're a stranger here

84
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,400
I knew it
They plan to play the stranger card

85
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:24,600
Aren't we all brothers, my friend?

86
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,800
- This is a very serious matter
- Yes, it is

87
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,565
So I thought perhaps we could
be serious for a second

88
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,700
You don't mean to tell a jury of your
fellow Virginians that shooting a man

89
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:40,565
the Commonwealth was in the process
of killing

90
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,400
was murder or manslaughter or in fact
any crime at all?

91
00:05:43,435 --> 00:05:45,765
It was a crime, according to the law

92
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,400
Understood, but a DA has discretion
whether to charge, do they not?

93
00:05:49,435 --> 00:05:50,467
- Good ones do
- Well, he looks good

94
00:05:50,502 --> 00:05:51,500
- He looks great
- Best I've seen

95
00:05:51,535 --> 00:05:52,300
Me, too

96
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Look

97
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,800
I am not dismissing the charges

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,700
He is going on trial for murder

99
00:05:57,735 --> 00:05:59,365
You're not my brother anymore,

100
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,900
which I believe leaves me free to have sex
with your sister

101
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,800
We try to make our cases fun

102
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,500
I can't thank you enough for seeing me,
Alan

103
00:06:15,535 --> 00:06:16,200
Please

104
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,100
So I hear you've become quite
the busy man these days, huh?

105
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Big lawyer

106
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,400
- A celebrity of sorts?
- Oh, well, no

107
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,650
Well, you look great

108
00:06:29,685 --> 00:06:30,600
- Thank you
- Yeah

109
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,200
You know, I always figured you to age fat
and bald

110
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,600
Well, I was lucky enough to stave off
the evil that so ages men

111
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,650
Which is?

112
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:40,500
Marriage

113
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,600
What's up, Mar

114
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,100
Well, unfortunately,
I was fired from my job

115
00:06:48,135 --> 00:06:48,700
- Aw
- Yeah

116
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,665
A very good job, I might add

117
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,300
I was district sales manager
for a software company,

118
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
in line to become regional sales manager

119
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,900
Now I know that this may be hard to prove,

120
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,800
but I think I got fired because I voted
for John McCain

121
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,300
My boss and I, we got into this big fight
over the election

122
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,500
And as soon as I told him who I voted for,

123
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,900
he just got this look of disgust
on his face, as

124
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,900
not entirely dissimilar to the expression
on your face at the moment

125
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,200
But anyway, uh, so he fired me

126
00:07:18,235 --> 00:07:20,565
Did he, uh, give you a reason?

127
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,000
No No, they don't have to give a reason
anymore

128
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,500
They're advised by their labor lawyers
not to

129
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,800
But I know it was because I voted
for McCain

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,600
I can feel it in my bones, Alan

131
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,600
And the prisoner started gasping for
breath and moving around on the table

132
00:07:36,635 --> 00:07:37,967
Is that uncommon?

133
00:07:38,002 --> 00:07:39,265
It's happened before

134
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,600
No two lethal injections ever seem to go
exactly the same way

135
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,600
There was a lot of screaming and yelling

136
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,800
Officer Holt became very

137
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,100
upset

138
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,500
Then he suddenly pulled out his gun
and shot the prisoner in the head

139
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,100
Are you familiar with the case Emmett
v Johnson?

140
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,300
I've heard of it

141
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,800
Something like lethal injection is cruel
and barbaric

142
00:07:59,835 --> 00:08:00,765
Something like

143
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,265
According to briefs filed in that case,

144
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,700
Virginia's method in particular carries
a greater risk of inflicting pain

145
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:08,367
than the method used in Kentucky,

146
00:08:08,402 --> 00:08:09,965
which the Supreme Court approved

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,800
Our methods are substantially the same

148
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,200
The briefing includes evidence
that members of the death team,

149
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,700
including, I assume, you,
don't understand how the drugs work,

150
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
don't know how to properly administer
an IV

151
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,300
and don't know how to correctly observe
the inmate during the execution

152
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:25,900
to determine if anything is going wrong

153
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,365
That's that's an argument in a lawsuit

154
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,800
There's another argument on the other
side Why don't you read that?

155
00:08:30,835 --> 00:08:31,965
Oh, I'm

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,200
are you aware that a prominent medical
society

157
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,100
has found Virginia's method of execution
unacceptable?

158
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,000
I know doctors have an issue with
the death penalty in general,

159
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,600
so it wouldn't surprise me if some
physicians' group said that

160
00:08:45,635 --> 00:08:46,465
Neither would I,

161
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,200
except the group I'm referring to

162
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,200
happens to be the American Veterinary
Medical Association

163
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,300
Some vets have banned your lethal
injection protocol

164
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,900
because the method Virginia uses on humans

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,500
is considered too barbaric to be used
on cats and dogs

166
00:09:01,535 --> 00:09:02,365
Objection

167
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,700
The AVMA has said that their report
was misinterpreted

168
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:06,600
Sustained

169
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,900
Mr Sack, this case is not about
the legitimacy of the death penalty

170
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,800
And if that's where you're coming from,

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,900
you can tuck in your little tail
and head on back to Massachusetts

172
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,900
Your honor, I'm very proud of my home
state

173
00:09:18,935 --> 00:09:21,265
home of the Red Sox, the Patriots, Mitt

174
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,500
We take our laws here in Virginia
very seriously, sir

175
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:25,865
Do you take this case seriously?

176
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,700
Show of hands
Because, you know, it is a bit silly

177
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,965
- Objection
- There's a man on trial here

178
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,950
for trying to kill somebody the state
was already killing

179
00:09:32,985 --> 00:09:35,900
If anything, my client accomplished the
death penalty

180
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:36,465
Mr Sack

181
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,400
the legitimacy of which I certainly
would never question,

182
00:09:38,435 --> 00:09:39,617
particularly in Virginia

183
00:09:39,652 --> 00:09:40,765
- Your honor!
- Mr Sack

184
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,465
Oh, how about torture? Are we for that?

185
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,800
- I'm warning you
- Because this man was being tortured

186
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,450
- That's why my client pulled the trigger
- Objection, your honor!

187
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:50,000
- Order Order! Order! Objection!
- To spare horrendous suffering!

188
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,700
Get control of the room, will you, judge?

189
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,000
Bailiff

190
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,400
Blank What's his problem?

191
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
How'd you even get the gun
in the courtroom?

192
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:20,467
Oh, please

193
00:10:20,502 --> 00:10:21,300
Denny

194
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,600
- What are you doing?
- Will you relax?

195
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,400
Like I said, firstly, it was blank,
secondly

196
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,200
This is Virginia

197
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,400
My approval rating went up in that room
I'm a hero to those people

198
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,700
I couldn't be more popular if I got kids
to smoke cigarettes

199
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,400
Carl, don't leave me here
I can't swing in here

200
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,000
Alan's way more fun

201
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,365
I appreciate you making the time
to see me

202
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,500
Oh, sure Well, actually,
my lawyer told me not to see you,

203
00:10:57,535 --> 00:10:59,200
but I never listen to him anyway

204
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,000
No, you certainly didn't bother to consult
with him before firing Martha

205
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,400
Nice try

206
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,600
Why did you fire her, Mr Feldcamp?

207
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,200
It wasn't working out

208
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,565
How so?

209
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,000
Oh, hard to say You know, as an employer,
you sometimes get a feel for an employee,

210
00:11:15,035 --> 00:11:18,700
and with Martha hard worker, but
she was never gonna make the next step,

211
00:11:18,735 --> 00:11:22,000
and in this company,
you either move up or you move out

212
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,365
Martha's of the impression that you
fired her

213
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,100
because she voted for John McCain
in the election

214
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,300
She's mistaken

215
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,200
Look, I voted for McCain, all right?

216
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,900
Martha simply wasn't working out

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,700
There must be a reason you didn't
think she was working out

218
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,000
If I have to depose you to force
an answer, I can do so,

219
00:11:46,035 --> 00:11:48,300
but you seem to be rather forthcoming,

220
00:11:48,335 --> 00:11:49,600
so why not just tell me now?

221
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,300
Okay

222
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,200
She's stupid

223
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,200
And as for evidence of her stupidity?

224
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:01,300
Oh, god, I could cite many

225
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,700
Cite one

226
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
She voted for McCain

227
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,600
You said you voted for him

228
00:12:06,635 --> 00:12:07,665
Mm-hmm Yeah, I did

229
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,965
I voted for him because I like his
policies on nuclear energy,

230
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,800
because I believed he'd make a better
commander in chief in times of war,

231
00:12:13,835 --> 00:12:15,665
because I trusted his experience

232
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,800
But Martha voted for McCain
because she found Sarah Palin to be spunky

233
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,500
So you admit you fired her because
of who she voted for

234
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,600
No, I fired her because she is stupid

235
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,300
Look, I got a bad feeling about her,
you know?

236
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,265
It's plain and simple

237
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,600
I'm starting to get a bad feeling
about you

238
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,700
Well, then it's lucky for me
that you're not my boss

239
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,000
Look, are we done?

240
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,200
No, I'm afraid we're not done

241
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,500
Rather, it seems we're just beginning

242
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,500
Look, Mr Shore, I fire people all the
time, and some of them go on to sue me

243
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,600
This is an at-will employment here
It's my will

244
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,450
So if you want to file a lawsuit, join the club

245
00:12:54,485 --> 00:12:57,200
Oh, I'm not a member of any club,
I assure you

246
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,600
I tend to stick out I don't mind
It makes me more memorable

247
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,500
You'll rember me, Mr Feldcamp

248
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,800
Yeah, don't let the door hit you on
the way out

249
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,000
First is sodium thiopental,
which is a barbiturate

250
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,265
Next comes pancuronium bromide,

251
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,100
a muscle relaxant that paralyzes the
diaphragm and thus stops breathing

252
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,400
Then potasum chloride is injected,
and that stops the heart

253
00:13:27,435 --> 00:13:29,700
But that's not what happened here

254
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,000
Not exactly

255
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,865
What did happen?

256
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,265
Well, the technician who started

257
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,100
the IV on the prisoner missed the vein
in one arm,

258
00:13:36,135 --> 00:13:37,065
and in the other arm,

259
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,700
he stuck the needle through the prisoner's
vein and into his muscle tissue

260
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,400
Do you know of other botched executions
using the lethal injection method?

261
00:13:45,435 --> 00:13:46,900
There have been too many to list

262
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,100
This is something that should be done
by doctors,

263
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,700
but doctors refuse to do it on ethical
grounds

264
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,965
But, I mean, to be fair,

265
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,565
in most instances where lethal injection
is used,

266
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,800
the condemned man just sort of drifts
off to a legal sleep without incident

267
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,865
It's more likely that the paralytic agent

268
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,100
simply prevents prisoners
from communicating

269
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,200
In fact, they could be suffocating,

270
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,100
suffering excruciating pain during
the procedure

271
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,800
They're just unable to scream

272
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,300
How many of these so-called botched
executions occurred in Virginia?

273
00:14:14,335 --> 00:14:14,865
One

274
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,100
And the supreme court has approved

275
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,500
the method of lethal injection used
in the Commonwealth of Virginia?

276
00:14:20,535 --> 00:14:22,467
And we know they're such sticklers

277
00:14:22,502 --> 00:14:24,400
Mr Sack, I will hold you in contempt

278
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,065
And the supreme court has not approved

279
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,700
prison guards shooting condemned
prisoners

280
00:14:30,735 --> 00:14:31,765
Has anybody asked them?

281
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,400
Now look, we all know things went wrong
here

282
00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:35,365
That's not the point

283
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,065
I will repeat, the question here is,

284
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,300
do we simply give prison guards the right
to just whip out their guns

285
00:14:42,335 --> 00:14:43,400
and blast away?

286
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,965
Well, thank you, your honor,

287
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,800
for framing the issue in such a neutral
and impartial way

288
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,765
Why do you need my help?

289
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,600
Well, I don't probably
it's just Denny's out of town and

290
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,265
Will you give up, ever?

291
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,900
I have no one to share private thoughts
with tonight on the balcony

292
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:17,500
Shirley, this man Feldcamp
the unfettered, smug arrogance

293
00:15:17,535 --> 00:15:20,500
he could almost make Rudy Giuliani
seem humble

294
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,300
Come on It'll be fun

295
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,165
He really fired her because
of how she voted?

296
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,100
Well, he's claiming it's stupidity,
but yes, I think he did

297
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,900
And what exactly would my role be?

298
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,200
Why do you say it with such distrust?

299
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:38,400
Because I can smell a dog on the sniff

300
00:15:38,435 --> 00:15:40,165
Don't be ridiculous

301
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,800
You're almost old enough to be my mother
or one of my mother's friends

302
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,200
the one who used to sunbathe naked
by the pool

303
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,265
So you want to march into court tomorrow,

304
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,600
the two of us side by side,
and fight for a woman who

305
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:57,100
Who voted for John McCain

306
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,965
He all but admitted to me, your honor,

307
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,150
that he fired her because she voted
for John McCain

308
00:16:14,185 --> 00:16:17,300
He made no such admission
The basis was her stupidity

309
00:16:17,335 --> 00:16:20,565
Yes, and the evidence of that
was her vote

310
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,965
Look, they got into a big political
debate three days before

311
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,400
during which, the plaintiff further
displayed a complete lack of intellect,

312
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:27,965
which prompted my client

313
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,600
Because she didn't share your client's
political point of view

314
00:16:30,635 --> 00:16:32,400
My client voted for McCain

315
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,600
Your honor, my client is a republican
who was happy with Ms

316
00:16:35,635 --> 00:16:38,700
Headly's vote, but nonetheless,
could not ignore that she was

317
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,100
Well, dumb

318
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,150
- How dare you?
- Ms Headly

319
00:16:43,185 --> 00:16:45,000
He just called me dumb and stupid

320
00:16:45,035 --> 00:16:45,900
Ms Headly

321
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,265
Mr Davidson, as I read the affidavit,

322
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,500
it does seem like she was fired
for her political opinions

323
00:16:52,535 --> 00:16:54,565
Free speech is not a right
in the workplace

324
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,100
People arer hired for their opinions and
perceived intellect

325
00:16:57,135 --> 00:16:58,700
that's why we have interviews,

326
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,400
to determine whether we like
what comes out of their mouths

327
00:17:01,435 --> 00:17:04,565
Listen, the fact is,
this woman did get hired,

328
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,500
and then she was discharged
for exactly as you say,

329
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:09,965
your honor, her political opinion

330
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,350
All right, I want to hear Ms Headly
on the stand,

331
00:17:12,385 --> 00:17:14,700
and I want to hear exactly how this
went down

332
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,600
Let's go

333
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,900
It seemed like

334
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,000
I don't know, like

335
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,900
like it had gone past the point
of torture even

336
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,765
I- I just

337
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,600
I couldn't watch him suffer anymore

338
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,800
So I, um

339
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,100
I took him out

340
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,700
Did you stop to think, sir,
that you were breaking the law by

341
00:17:38,735 --> 00:17:39,365
No, no, no, no, no

342
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:45,700
All I could see w- was a person suffering,
just way beyond the point of

343
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,800
it was inhumane

344
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,900
Somebody had to do something

345
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,700
I yelled at the others,
but they just stood there, so

346
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,700
it just wasn't right

347
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,865
You decided all by yourself
to take a human life

348
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,300
No, the the man was dying anyway
I made the decision to be humane about it

349
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:06,100
I see

350
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,800
I've prosecuted two doctors
who made the same decision

351
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,100
They had terminal patients in agony,
so they decided to hasten their deaths

352
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,600
In fact, I believe your family faced
a similar situation

353
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,200
You had an aunt who was dying
of ovarian cancer Am I right?

354
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,865
Yes

355
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,400
And there were those in your family

356
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,900
who wanted to put her on a morphine drip
to speed things up

357
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,000
because she was suffering so

358
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,300
Is that true?

359
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,000
Yes

360
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,700
What was your position there?

361
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,100
Do you remember?

362
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,200
I was against it

363
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,900
You thought it was murder, didn't you?

364
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,900
You told your mother and the doctor,

365
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,400
"only god gets to make that call "

366
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,800
Do you now amend that to god
and correctional officers?

367
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,800
We got into this huge argument
on nuclear energy

368
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm against, and he's for it

369
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,200
Now that argument somehow got replaced
by some brough-ha-ha on the war

370
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,700
I'm against it, and he's for it

371
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,065
And that segued into taxes,

372
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,665
and he doesn't think he should have
to pay any,

373
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,400
- and I said to him that if he
- So you had a lot of political differences?

374
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Yes Yes

375
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,000
Well, then the very next day,

376
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,800
after I did inform him that I voted
for McCain,

377
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,065
he called me a complete idiot

378
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,700
Uh, Mr Feldcamp called you an idiot?

379
00:19:41,735 --> 00:19:42,565
A complete one

380
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,100
And then what happened?

381
00:19:44,135 --> 00:19:45,565
Well, not long after that,

382
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,700
he walked into my office and he fired me

383
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,465
Have you ever had any yearly reviews

384
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,900
with respect to your employment
with Mr Feldcamp?

385
00:19:53,935 --> 00:19:54,700
Yes

386
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800
How'd they go?

387
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,900
Okay

388
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,500
He said I could perform better
and he said sales could be higher

389
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,900
But in this economy? Come on

390
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,665
You know that

391
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,800
It's bad everywhere

392
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,800
I mean, it's, like, the number one
problem in this country right now

393
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,000
So you consider the economy to be the
number one problem in the country?

394
00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:13,000
Yes, I do

395
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,100
If I may ask, how does John McCains
economical policy differ from Barack Obama's?

396
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,300
Taxes

397
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,600
and, um

398
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,565
well I'm not exactly sure about it,
to be honest

399
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,600
Well, if you consider it to be the number
one problem in the country

400
00:20:37,635 --> 00:20:40,300
Look, even despite how they all
say they'll be different,

401
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,900
they all do the same thing once
they get elected

402
00:20:42,935 --> 00:20:44,100
Come on You know that

403
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,900
You were an ardent Hillary Clinton
supporter, were you not?

404
00:20:46,935 --> 00:20:49,000
Yes, I was, proudly

405
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,565
And according to your coworkers,

406
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,400
you crossed over to McCain primarily
because of Sarah Palin

407
00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:54,265
Yes

408
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,100
Because her policies were consistent
with Hillary's?

409
00:20:57,135 --> 00:20:58,800
Because I was impressed with her

410
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,800
And because she strikes me
as a real american,

411
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,600
which is what this country needs

412
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,000
And you liked her spunk

413
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,800
And the country needs spunk, too, yes

414
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,400
I don't have a good feeling on this one,
Denny

415
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,600
Virginia is not being nice to me

416
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,100
A little constructive criticism?

417
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:31,765
Okay

418
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,200
You're not very good

419
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,965
Thanks for keeping it constructive

420
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,600
Well, you're making this a referendum
on the death penalty

421
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,400
You gotta get it through that liberal,
democrat skull

422
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:43,300
americans love the death penalty

423
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,400
We do?

424
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,200
Yeah, especially these parts

425
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,800
Hillary and Obama,

426
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,400
you know those pinko-heads couldn't
really be pro-death penalty,

427
00:21:53,435 --> 00:21:54,500
but they claim they aren't

428
00:21:54,535 --> 00:21:55,465
and in fact,

429
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,900
almost everyone who runs for president
miraculously is for the death penalty

430
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,965
Why?

431
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,400
'Cause this is the US of A

432
00:22:03,435 --> 00:22:04,900
death penalty rules

433
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,400
Flip the switch, ready, aim, fire,
turn up the gas

434
00:22:08,435 --> 00:22:09,900
it's who we are as a people

435
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,000
Hell, you you heard it at the republican convention

436
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,900
Kill, baby, kill

437
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,500
It's our mantra, Carl

438
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,700
I thought republicans were pro-life

439
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,600
That's for babies Criminals we kill

440
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,800
You're going about this ass backwards

441
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,300
The argument you want to make
to the jury is this

442
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,600
that, uh, uh, Willis guy,

443
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,100
he wasn't dying the way he
was supposed to

444
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,600
After receiving the injection,

445
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,200
the bastard refused to choke out

446
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,900
So our client finished him off

447
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,300
Job done, game over, bang

448
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,900
Preston Holt, american hero

449
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,900
Kill, baby, kill

450
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Do you think

451
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,500
Martha and Sarah and Joe the

452
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,650
is he an electrician?

453
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,200
Plumber, unlicensed

454
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,500
Are are they the real americans?

455
00:23:11,535 --> 00:23:12,465
Not necessarily

456
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,700
I think that's what this election
just proved,

457
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,300
that real americans aren't just rural
and white

458
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:25,400
The portrait of real americans
has been redrawn in this election

459
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,550
Real americans are of all ages, races,
ethnicities

460
00:23:29,585 --> 00:23:33,300
they live in cities and apartments
as well as

461
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,500
Farms I

462
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,900
We have a president-elect who fits into
no

463
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:45,000
category or demographic whatsoever
other than he's an american

464
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,900
God, I wept that night

465
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,800
Did you?

466
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,600
No, I just

467
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,600
watched and watched and

468
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,700
didn't want the night to end

469
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,800
I already miss Sarah Palin, though

470
00:24:10,835 --> 00:24:12,300
She was fun while she lasted

471
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,500
I hope they let her keep the wardrobe

472
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:25,200
I still have to say though as heartened as
I am by the election and by America

473
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,700
What?

474
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,565
Martha's a little bit of an idiot

475
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,000
Shirley, almost 47% of this country
didn't vote for Obama,

476
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,600
perhaps because they disagreed with him
on the issues, which is fine

477
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,600
But some, no doubt,

478
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,500
because they thought he was muslim
with terrorists on his speed dial,

479
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:51,200
and others because th-they were convinced
he was not only socialist,

480
00:24:51,235 --> 00:24:52,765
but even worse, a bad bowler,

481
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,800
and others still because they simply

482
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,400
loved those cream-colored jackets Sarah
may have to give back

483
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,600
But there's one thing all those idiots
have in common

484
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,600
What?

485
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,800
They still get to vote

486
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,100
What?

487
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,500
Sorry

488
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,300
Just looking at you under a gently
lit sky with

489
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,400
sharing the same oral fixation Denny
and I

490
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:38,000
Is it a little game, Alan, or or
are you really sexually attracted to me?

491
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,600
I'm sexually attracted to you

492
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,265
I'm in my 60s

493
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,000
Well, first of all, you're beautiful

494
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,300
And second, your intellect is

495
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,300
dazzling

496
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,600
And third, I've seen the naked pictures
of you

497
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,400
- Oh, right
- Let's not discuss the cheerleader outfit

498
00:25:59,435 --> 00:26:00,400
Oh

499
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,500
So if I

500
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,600
if I wanted to go there, you'd go there?

501
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
In a second

502
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,900
Oh, if only Obama had picked you
as vice president

503
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,900
what a world we'd have then

504
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,200
Look

505
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,200
I can see the defendant's point

506
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,900
The man was dying anyway

507
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,700
What's the big deal?

508
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,200
Well

509
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,000
what about the doctor or the hospice
worker

510
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,000
who wants to speed the death of that
cancer patient dying in agony?

511
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,365
Or what about the nurses who opt to
withhold treatment

512
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,100
from those severely retarded infants
who only face a lifetime of misery?

513
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,800
We don't go down that path

514
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,600
We don't start measuring the quality
of people's lives

515
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:17,200
to decide whether or not they live

516
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,400
The defendant took the law into his
own hands

517
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,200
and murdered somebody

518
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,900
Nobody gets the right to do that

519
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,900
Whether the person is on death row,

520
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,500
whether a person has a day left to live,
an hour or even a minute

521
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,400
you don't get to shoot somebody

522
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,300
That's the law

523
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,200
That's the law

524
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,600
because of a presumed sanctity
of human life?

525
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,500
That sanctity was off the table here

526
00:27:51,535 --> 00:27:53,800
The life was being executed by the state

527
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,265
Uh, forgive me,

528
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,650
but you know what I think is really
going on

529
00:28:01,685 --> 00:28:04,042
is this man doesn't like capital
punishment,

530
00:28:04,077 --> 00:28:06,400
and he's trying to bring scrutiny upon it

531
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:07,900
It's the only possible explanation

532
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,500
If he can get you to say this execution
was wrong,

533
00:28:11,535 --> 00:28:13,467
well, that's one step from saying,

534
00:28:13,502 --> 00:28:15,400
"gee, maybe executions are wrong "

535
00:28:15,435 --> 00:28:16,365
That's ridiculous

536
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,500
More ridiculous than accusing a man of
murdering someone who was being executed?

537
00:28:20,535 --> 00:28:21,700
Let's not kid ourselves

538
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,800
There are those out there trying
to get rid of capital punishment

539
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,565
and I would suspect they have to be tricky

540
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,465
because they know we the people
are overwhelmingly for it

541
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:36,500
We the people know the death penalty
is one of the things that makes America

542
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,200
well, America

543
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,400
Not many countries have it, you know?

544
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,000
We're we're the only westernized
country left

545
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,200
And it's not easy being in the company
of Iraq,

546
00:28:47,235 --> 00:28:50,400
China, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Sudan

547
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,465
And I'll admit,

548
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,700
the reasons for abolishing capital
punishment are compelling

549
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,000
It costs us hundreds of millions
of dollars,

550
00:28:58,035 --> 00:29:00,100
up to six times more than life
imprisonment

551
00:29:00,135 --> 00:29:01,900
It doesn't seem to deter crime

552
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,800
Murder rates are actually lower
in non-death-penalty states

553
00:29:04,835 --> 00:29:05,800
It's well-known

554
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,600
Canada's homicide rate fell 40%
after they abolished the death penalty

555
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,500
We botch executions a lot

556
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,800
Medical evidence now shows that even
when they go off without a hitch,

557
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,100
the executed suffer perhaps excruciating
pain

558
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:26,100
There are many reasons to do away
with capital punishment

559
00:29:26,135 --> 00:29:29,900
but we don't because, let's face it,
the death penalty?

560
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,565
It's who we are as a people

561
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,500
We're an eye-for-an-eye kind of nation,
and we don't have to apologize for it

562
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,000
Listen, if somebody killed my son

563
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,800
we believe in executing murderers

564
00:29:41,835 --> 00:29:44,300
it's justice

565
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,700
The only thing my client did here
was carry out the state's mission

566
00:29:49,735 --> 00:29:52,917
It makes no sense to be prosecuting him

567
00:29:52,952 --> 00:29:56,065
The only conceivable explanation is that

568
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:01,300
this man is insidiously trying to bring
scrutiny on the death penalty

569
00:30:01,335 --> 00:30:04,700
because he secretly is against it

570
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,100
No, look, as I said to her lawyer over
there, I like Martha Headly

571
00:30:21,135 --> 00:30:22,000
Nice lady

572
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,200
But my god, sales is about selling,
it's about relating to people

573
00:30:25,235 --> 00:30:26,765
She doesn't even read the newspaper

574
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,900
Well, George Bush doesn't read the paper

575
00:30:28,935 --> 00:30:30,300
I'd never hire George Bush

576
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,465
Would anybody?

577
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,450
And yet you voted for John McCain,
who supports

578
00:30:33,485 --> 00:30:35,400
No, no, no, no, no
this is not about politics

579
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,700
This is about being smart or not smart,
and she is the latter

580
00:30:39,735 --> 00:30:41,265
But, Mr Feldcamp, to be fair,

581
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,965
you're basing your conclusion
on her political opinion

582
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,500
No, what I'm saying is that whatever
your opinion is about anything,

583
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,200
at least be able to defend it,

584
00:30:48,235 --> 00:30:49,300
and failing that,

585
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,865
articulate it

586
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,700
Martha's never been the brightest bulb
in the tanning booth,

587
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,950
but when she talks politics,
I, you know, I just cringe

588
00:30:55,985 --> 00:30:57,900
I go, "how can I have a person
like that working for me?"

589
00:30:57,935 --> 00:30:58,900
Well, guess what My company

590
00:30:59,100 --> 00:30:59,800
I don't have to

591
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,500
Do you make all your employees defend
their political beliefs?

592
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,165
Not all my employees launch into them

593
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
But had she defended hers better,
she might

594
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:10,265
Look, look, look, for 16 months,

595
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,900
she just went prancing around talking
Hillary, Hillary, Hillary, Hillary,

596
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,400
and then she railed against Obama's
inexperience all throughout the primaries,

597
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,865
and then out comes some moose hunter
from Alaska

598
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,600
she knows nothing about Sarah Palin
or about John McCain

599
00:31:23,635 --> 00:31:24,900
What does that say about her?

600
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,100
- Sarah?
- No

601
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:26,717
Hillary?

602
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:27,265
Her!

603
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,100
What does it say about a person
who can be so arbitrary, so fice?

604
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:32,800
And this is about stuff she actually
felt strongly about

605
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,300
I'll tell you what it says

606
00:31:34,335 --> 00:31:36,200
She is an idiot

607
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,900
You know, let somebody else hire her

608
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,500
I don't think it'll be you

609
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,500
How dare you let him go off on me
like that in a courtroom

610
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:45,800
- I didn't let him go off I was
- Yes, you did

611
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,800
He was bellowing that I was an idiot,

612
00:31:47,835 --> 00:31:48,900
and you just sat there,

613
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,100
and so did you

614
00:31:50,135 --> 00:31:51,065
Of all people

615
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,350
Now wait What's that supposed to mean?

616
00:31:53,385 --> 00:31:55,600
It means that it was blatant sexism

617
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,300
And I expected more from a person
of your caliber

618
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:01,065
Now hold on here

619
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,400
Is that the kind of lawyer you are?

620
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,000
Is that the kind of woman?

621
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,700
Honey, the sexist in all this is you

622
00:32:07,735 --> 00:32:08,865
- Me?
- Yeah

623
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,265
You claim to be a staunch Hillary
Clinton supporter

624
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:15,300
You you walked into that booth and voted
against everything Hillary stands for,

625
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,465
and why?

626
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,900
Because the republicans added to their
ticket someone they referred

627
00:32:19,935 --> 00:32:22,200
to at the convention as "the hot chick "

628
00:32:22,235 --> 00:32:23,000
Oh

629
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,400
So you just sit quiet and let me get
brutalized on the stand

630
00:32:26,435 --> 00:32:28,065
I sat there for two reasons

631
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,000
First, there was no valid objection
to be made

632
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,600
And second?

633
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,500
You are an idiot

634
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,000
At-will employment means exactly that,
your honor

635
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,900
At the employer's will

636
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,300
Certainly, we can't fire anybody for race
or ethnicity

637
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,800
But, well, intellect or a person's lack
of it?

638
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,500
Bosses fire people all the time for that

639
00:32:59,535 --> 00:33:00,800
But, Mr Davidson,

640
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,100
to fire someone for their political opinion
is still

641
00:33:04,135 --> 00:33:05,365
Your honor, if I may,

642
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,600
that's one way to look at this

643
00:33:06,635 --> 00:33:07,465
The other way

644
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,700
are we saying that stupidity
can never be grounds for discharge

645
00:33:11,735 --> 00:33:13,500
when it's cloaked in political content?

646
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,900
He's the boss

647
00:33:14,935 --> 00:33:16,165
It's his company

648
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,500
So as long as he stays within the law,

649
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,400
he gets to hire and fire who he wants

650
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:26,150
The unassailable right to vote
is the core principle of any democracy

651
00:33:26,185 --> 00:33:30,400
And people have the right to cast their
ballot for whomever they want

652
00:33:30,435 --> 00:33:33,600
for good reasons or for bad reasons
or for no reason at all

653
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,100
Let's face it, your honor,

654
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,465
we as a nation are horribly uninformed
when it comes to politics

655
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:44,000
Approximately one-third of the people
in this country, people of voting age,

656
00:33:44,035 --> 00:33:46,000
couldn't tell you the name of our current
Vice President

657
00:33:46,035 --> 00:33:48,265
Now admittedly,
some of us like to block it out,

658
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:53,600
but even so, only two in five adult americans
know we have three branches of government

659
00:33:53,635 --> 00:33:55,665
and Mr Feldcamp expects his employees

660
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,200
to actually know the political issues
of the day?

661
00:33:58,235 --> 00:34:01,167
Well, today our news programs consist
solely

662
00:34:01,202 --> 00:34:03,651
of sensational headlines and sound bites

663
00:34:03,686 --> 00:34:06,065
People forego newspapers for the internet,

664
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,865
where instead of relying on credentialed
journalists,

665
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,400
they turn to these bloggers
sort of entry-level life-forms

666
00:34:12,435 --> 00:34:15,367
that intellectually have yet to emerge
from the primordial ooze

667
00:34:15,402 --> 00:34:18,300
This is how we've gotten
the elected officials we've gotten

668
00:34:18,335 --> 00:34:20,300
We've never really cared about issues

669
00:34:20,335 --> 00:34:20,865
Come on

670
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:25,900
We're more concerned with how Hillary
looks in a pantsuit or whether Barack can bowl

671
00:34:25,935 --> 00:34:29,465
We don't always go for the best
or the brightest

672
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,200
We elect the guy we'd most like to have
a beer with or the gal we'd most like

673
00:34:32,235 --> 00:34:33,565
to feel up in the back of the car

674
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:39,000
Now I certainly wouldn't pick my airline
pilot that way or my accountant or doctor,

675
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,967
but for my President, so often, it's,

676
00:34:41,002 --> 00:34:42,865
"give me the blue-collar, lunch-bucket,

677
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,300
good ol' boy who fits in best
at the pancake breakfast "

678
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,200
The problem with Mr Feldcamp,

679
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,065
and forgive me,

680
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,000
I hesitate to say this about anybody,
but he's an elitist

681
00:34:51,035 --> 00:34:51,665
Objection

682
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,500
I realize that's much worse than being
called stupid

683
00:34:53,535 --> 00:34:54,600
Mr Shore,

684
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,100
Let's stay on message

685
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,900
The message is, we vote for who we like

686
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,300
It's as simple as that
We don't need to have a reason

687
00:35:01,335 --> 00:35:02,265
It's as simple as that

688
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,465
The founding fathers did not
form a meritocracy

689
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,700
This is a democracy
We can be as stupid as we choose

690
00:35:07,735 --> 00:35:10,700
We're americans We're as simple as that

691
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,700
All right Look

692
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,200
I don't like it

693
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:22,300
But just as we don't get into
why a person voted the way he or she did,

694
00:35:22,335 --> 00:35:25,800
nor do we get into why a boss terminates
somebody in an at-will

695
00:35:25,835 --> 00:35:28,167
Whoa, whoa, wait
It sounds like I'm losing

696
00:35:28,202 --> 00:35:30,500
Your motion for an injunctive relief is denied

697
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,500
If she wants to sue for lost wages,
I can't stop her

698
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,900
But we're done here We are adjourned

699
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,600
I'm sorry, Martha

700
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,400
You didn't try hard enough

701
00:35:42,435 --> 00:35:43,600
That's what happened

702
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,500
I'll be suing you next

703
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,200
I never liked you

704
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,400
She seemed much more fun in high school

705
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,465
Oh, well

706
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,365
Shirley, in anticipation of winning,

707
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,200
I booked a little celebration dinner
at the Ritz

708
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,600
The restaurant that comes equipped
with private rooms

709
00:36:05,635 --> 00:36:08,000
should we have too much celebratory wine

710
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,100
Shirley, one's life is a sum of his
or her experiences

711
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,100
Okay, Alan

712
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,600
Oh

713
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,100
With Denny's permission

714
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,100
- What? Why do you need
- Because I do

715
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,200
Till then

716
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,100
I'll be waiting

717
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,000
Has the jury reached a verdict?

718
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:43,100
We have your honor

719
00:36:43,135 --> 00:36:44,100
How say you?

720
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,200
"In the matter of the Commonwealth
of Virginia "vs Preston Holt

721
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,100
"on the charge of murder in the
second degree,

722
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,400
"we find the defendant not guilty "

723
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,100
The court thanks you for your service

724
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,300
The defendant is free to go
We are adjourned

725
00:37:01,335 --> 00:37:02,217
Thank you, Mr Sack

726
00:37:02,252 --> 00:37:03,100
Uh, you're welcome

727
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,600
I wasn't exactly sure of your strategy
there, but

728
00:37:05,635 --> 00:37:07,300
not to worry Neither was I

729
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,200
Thank you, Mr Crane

730
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,900
You're welcome, son

731
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,265
Do you think it's odd that
when running for office,

732
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:36,100
having an ivy league education
is considered a liability?

733
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,600
No You don't?

734
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,200
No, a Harvard grad took us into Vietnam,

735
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,600
a Yale grad bought us Iraq
We've learned our lesson

736
00:37:45,635 --> 00:37:46,165
Denny

737
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,700
between you and me, do we really think
he made it through Yale?

738
00:37:48,735 --> 00:37:49,900
With a little help

739
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,600
Denny, there's

740
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,600
something a little

741
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,000
well, delicate I've been meaning
to discuss

742
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,165
What?

743
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,100
Well, they say as a man

744
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,200
ages,

745
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:17,500
he eventually sits alone with nothing
but his memories

746
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,300
I'm concerned that

747
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,600
well, with the

748
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,500
mad cow,

749
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:28,300
y- you could possibly be robbed
of your memories in the end

750
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,600
And what a horrible thing,

751
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,900
not being able to even recollect
the things

752
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,800
that brought you your most profound joy

753
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,900
Making love to Shirley

754
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,100
how sad if one day

755
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,500
you weren't able to remember all the

756
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,600
wonders of Shirley, how she

757
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,300
smelled, how she tasted, how

758
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,000
I was thinking

759
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,900
if that day ever came,
and you no longer

760
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,800
it would be great if I could tell you
about it to help you remember

761
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,900
Maybe I should make love with Shirley
once, just so I'd know

762
00:39:17,935 --> 00:39:19,000
You're pathetic

763
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,065
Exploiting my mad cow

764
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,400
just so you could get in the sack
with Shirley?

765
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,400
All right

766
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,165
I can't believe you just did that

767
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,800
Waltzing me down mad cow lane where
there's no memory lane just so you

768
00:39:31,835 --> 00:39:32,700
All right

769
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,900
Here's where your logic failed, Alan

770
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,400
First of all, I'll never be alone because
I got you

771
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,400
Secondly, I could never forget
what it was like to be with Shirley

772
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,700
because there was a magic there that
no man could never forget

773
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,700
In fact, there's a chance

774
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,300
that it'll be the last memory
I'll have in the end

775
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,600
It could be the only thing I'll talk
about in the end

776
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,900
All day long

777
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,700
every day

778
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,800
I'll tell you about it

779
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,100
I'll tell you

780
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:19,300
how we moved together as one
one night on the beach in Nantucket

781
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,300
how her breasts were as soft
and as pure as a baby's behind

782
00:40:24,335 --> 00:40:26,500
- You really are cruel
- Yes, I am

783
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,100
Cruel enough to shoot you if you
so much as look at Shirley

784
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,900
I need a new woman to objectify

785
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,000
What do you think of Sarah Palin?

786
00:40:42,035 --> 00:40:45,500
Oh, those pouty lips

787
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,100
and the those down-to-earth,
slutty good looks

788
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,600
I've got two things to say about Sarah
Palin

789
00:40:51,635 --> 00:40:53,300
right here

790
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,400
right now

791
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,100
You're an angry sexist

792
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,900
Why do you ask then?

793
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,200
Just wondering aloud

794
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,100
What about Shirley and Sarah

795
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,700
together?

796
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:35,300
Who wouldn't for for that
