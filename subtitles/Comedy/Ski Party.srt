BE MY GIRL. SERIOUSLY.

779
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,434
I MEAN, SEE ONLY ME
WHILE WE'RE UP HERE.

780
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:46,470
YOU MEAN, LIKE, UM,
GO STEADY IN THE SNOW?

781
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:47,772
YOU'VE GOT TO.

782
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:52,310
TODD, I DON'T
"GOT TO" DO ANYTHING.

783
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:56,480
YOU CAN'T TELL A
GIRL TO BE YOUR GIRL.

784
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,750
IT HAS TO COME
FROM HER. SLOWLY.

785
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,352
YOU'RE TOO ANXIOUS.

786
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,487
YEAH, I GUESS
YOU'RE RIGHT.

787
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:04,822
MY TECHNIQUE'S
NOWHERE.

788
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:07,124
YOU EVEN SAID IT THAT
NIGHT AT THE DRIVE-IN.

789
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,893
JUST BE HONEST.

790
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,995
THEN LINDA, WHAT
AM I DOING WRONG?

791
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:12,763
OH, I KNOW,
EVERYTHING.

792
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,899
YOU ALWAYS ANSWER
YOUR OWN QUESTIONS.

793
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:16,567
WHY DO YOU
ALWAYS DO THAT?

794
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,903
THEN TELL ME
WHAT'S THE RIGHT
TECHNIQUE, LINDA,

795
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,438
TO GET A GIRL
TO CARE FOR YOU.

796
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:21,906
A GIRL LIKE YOU.

797
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:25,576
OH, TODD, A GIRL
DOESN'T TELL A BOY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

798
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,344
THEY DON'T?

799
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,347
NO. THEY MIGHT
TELL ANOTHER GIRL

800
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,882
HOW TO SPOT A PHONY
FROM A REAL GUY.

801
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,785
OH, SURE. YEAH,
SURE, SURE.

802
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,455
WOMEN ARE MUCH
TOO COMPETITIVE TO
HELP EACH OTHER.

803
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,423
OH, NO.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

804
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:40,925
WHY, JUST
THIS AFTERNOON,

805
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,928
I WAS STRAIGHTENING
OUT 2 ENGLISH GIRLS
ABOUT AMERICAN BOYS.

806
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:45,329
YOU WERE?

807
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:46,931
YEAH, I WAS GOING
TO TELL THEM MORE

808
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,466
AS SOON AS WE
GET BACK TO
THE LODGE.

809
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,368
I SEE. THEN YOU'LL
PROBABLY GIVE THEM

810
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,003
THE REST OF THE
SCOOP TOMORROW, HUH?

811
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,871
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I WAS GOING TO
INVITE THEM

812
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,306
UP TO OUR
ROOM FOR COCOA

813
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,340
AFTER THE
SLEIGH RIDE,

814
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,376
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THEY LIVE.

815
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,378
OH, WELL, UH,
IF I SEE THEM,

816
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:01,946
I'LL, UH,
I'LL TELL THEM
TO DROP OVER.

817
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:04,515
OH, GREAT. THEY WERE
REALLY LOTS OF FUN.

818
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,418
MORE THAN
CRAIG AND ME?

819
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:11,422
IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

820
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,425
NEVER CHANGE 'EM

821
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:17,428
NEVER CHANGE 'EM

822
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:22,533
WE'LL NEVER
CHANGE 'EM, THEY'LL
ALWAYS BE THE SAME

823
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:24,368
NEVER CHANGE 'EM

824
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:28,372
WE'LL NEVER
CHANGE 'EM, IT'S SUCH
A FOOLISH GAME

825
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,907
NEVER CHANGE 'EM

826
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,643
NO MATTER WHAT,
WHAT WE SAY

827
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:35,579
YOU KNOW THEY'LL
ALWAYS HAVE THEIR WAY

828
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,415
WE'LL NEVER
CHANGE 'EM

829
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:38,816
NEVER CHANGE 'EM

830
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:40,418
WE'LL NEVER
CHANGE 'EM

831
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:41,585
NEVER CHANGE 'EM

832
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:45,690
WE'LL NEVER CHANGE 'EM,
WE'LL NEVER MAKE 'EM SEE

833
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:47,591
NEVER CHANGE 'EM

834
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:52,163
WE'LL NEVER CHANGE 'EM,
IT'S PLAIN AS IT CAN BE

835
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:53,597
NEVER CHANGE 'EM

836
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:56,667
WE NEVER WANT
TO LET 'EM GO

837
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:59,403
DON'T YOU KNOW
THAT WE LOVE 'EM SO?

838
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:00,838
WE'LL NEVER
CHANGE 'EM

839
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:02,606
NEVER CHANGE 'EM

840
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,841
WE'LL NEVER

841
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:05,509
NEVER CHANGE 'EM

842
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,878
MAYBE WE SHOULD
FORGET ABOUT 'EM

843
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:10,881
MAYBE WE SHOULD
SAY GOODBYE

844
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:14,385
WHAT WOULD WE
EVER DO WITHOUT 'EM?

845
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:17,388
RIGHT OR WRONG,
WE KNOW THEY'RE
STILL OUR GUYS

NEVER CHANGE 'EM

849
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:30,634
WE'LL NEVER CHANGE 'EM,
THEY'VE GOT TO
HAVE THEIR PRIDE

850
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:31,469
NEVER CHANGE 'EM

851
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:34,538
WE WOULDN'T TRY,
IF WE COULD

852
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:37,575
THAT'S WHY WE
WANT IT UNDERSTOOD

[Laughing]

875
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,495
WHERE DID YOU
GIRLS LEARN HOW
TO DO THE FISH?

876
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,297
IT WAS TOO MUCH.

877
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:34,932
[Girls laughing]

878
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,100
[Nora]
DO IT AGAIN!

879
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,701
HOT COCOA,
ANYONE?

880
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:39,970
OH, JUST WHAT I NEED
ON A COLD NIGHT.

881
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:41,672
ME, TOO.
I'M FREEZING.

882
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,507
YOU LOOK WARM.

883
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,943
SURE YOU WOULDN'T BE
MORE COMFORTABLE WITH
THAT BATHROBE OFF?

884
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:47,511
YES, WHY DON'T
YOU TAKE IT OFF?

885
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,347
NO! NO! NO,
I'M JUST FINE.
THANK YOU.

886
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:53,083
HEY, LISTEN,
SPEAKING OF
DUMB BOYS,

887
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,554
DID I TELL YOU ABOUT
THE TIME I TAUGHT
CRAIG GAMBLE A LESSON

888
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,789
FOR ARRIVING LATE
ON OUR FIRST DATE?

889
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:02,626
NO, BUT WE'RE
JUST DYING TO HEAR,
AREN'T WE, NORA?

890
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,727
JUST DYING.

891
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:08,132
WELL, WE WERE
PARKED UP ON MULHOLLAND
DRIVE, IN THE DARK

892
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:10,568
AND HE DECIDED
HE HAD TO KISS ME.

893
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,569
WHAT DID
YOU SAY?

894
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,804
[Barbara]
I SAID NO, NATURALLY.

895
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,573
BOY, THAT KINSEY
WAS SOME LIAR.

896
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:17,541
WHAT HAPPENED?

897
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:20,077
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
HE LOCKED ALL
THE CAR DOORS

898
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,879
AND THEN HE
TRIED TO TIE MY ARMS

899
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,014
BEHIND MY BACK
WITH MY HAIR RIBBON.

900
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,750
SO, I
FIXED HIM.

901
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,818
I LET HIM
KISS ME.

902
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,587
THAT'S
GETTING EVEN?

903
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,022
I HAD A CIGARETTE
IN MY MOUTH
AT THE TIME.

904
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:33,591
[Laughing]

905
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,628
AND HIS NOSE
AND HIS CHIN,
AND HIS EYEBROWS

906
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:42,733
SO, IT TURNED
OUT TO BE A VERY
PASSIONATE KISS.

907
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,769
OH, YOU KNOW, BOYS
ARE ALL RIGHT.

908
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,572
YOU JUST HAVE TO
WATCH THEM EVERY
MINUTE. THAT'S ALL.

909
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:51,876
WHY, JUST TONIGHT,
TODD TRIED TO PUT
HIS ARM AROUND ME.

910
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,545
WHAT HAPPENED?

911
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:57,748
ANYBODY WANT A DATE
WITH A NICE-LOOKING
BOY WITH ONLY ONE ARM?

[Laughing]

913
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:03,587
HE NEVER TRIED THAT AGAIN.
AT LEAST, NOT WITH ME.

914
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:04,755
[Janet]
IS HE ALL RIGHT NOW?

915
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:07,791
OH, YES, HE'S COMING
BACK TO SCHOOL
NEXT SEMESTER

916
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:10,594
THAT IS, IF
HIS PAROLE COMES
THROUGH IN TIME.

917
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:13,197
OH, WELL,
IT'S GETTING
KIND OF LATE.

918
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,099
NORA AND I
HAD BETTER
BE GOING.

919
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:16,767
NORA!

YOU SEE, WHEN
SHE HEARD YOU
WERE COMING,

1782
01:28:32,006 --> 01:28:34,208
