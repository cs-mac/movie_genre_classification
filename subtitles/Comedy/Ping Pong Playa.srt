1
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,744
Welcome back to

2
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:16,111
<i>Eye on East Hills
with Jon Howard.</i>

3
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,513
Look, people think

4
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:18,744
that sports is fair,
you know,

5
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:20,217
just 'cause it got rules
and stuff.

6
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:22,083
You know,
but is it fair that,

7
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,487
you know,
Chinese people are short

8
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:27,253
or, you know, we have fewer
fast-twitch muscles in our legs?

9
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:28,760
How do you explain
Yao Ming then?

10
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:32,559
Yao Ming is a statistical
anomaly, all right?

11
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:35,760
You take a country
of 1.4 billion people,

12
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:38,633
you're sure to have a few
hundred tall, right?

13
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,195
And out of that few hundred,
you know,

14
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:42,537
you're bound to have at least
one or two that can play ball.

15
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:43,837
Statistical anomaly.

16
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,434
Never seen Charlie Chan.

17
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:46,706
Never forget Vincent Chin.

18
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,304
I'm 'bout to drop
some knowledge on you.

19
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,678
Let the lesson begin.

20
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,580
Now, I'ma teach
this assignment in slang,

21
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,551
brother, change
the whole world to see shit

22
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,178
<i>like The Eye
by the Pang brothers.</i>

23
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,155
Asian American
who ain't afraid to say

24
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,713
comparing me
to David Carradine

25
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,692
will get you set ablaze
with kerosene.

26
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,591
I don't call
television racist,

27
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:04,562
<i>but I do watch The Simpsons
and SpongeBob</i>

28
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,565
just to see
some yellow faces.

29
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,658
I take the yellow haters
down like elevators.

30
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,827
Left hand on your girl.

31
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,928
Right foot
on the accelerator.

32
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,029
You ain't laughing at that.

33
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,630
I'm that new type of Asian.

34
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:16,402
I'll let you
do the math on that one.

35
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:17,704
I'ma teach you who's me

36
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:19,301
'cause I'm the Bruce Lee
of loose-leaf,

37
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,346
the Donnie N. Of rhyming,

38
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,778
and the Jackie Chan
of rapping, man.

39
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,408
Orient Express coming through!

40
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,281
Forget what
you think you know.

41
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:27,842
I'll teach
your ashes a lesson.

42
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,151
Listen and learn
and don't ask me no questions.

43
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,748
Wake up, kids, and keep
your eyes in my direction.

44
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,418
Welcome
to my Chinese school.

45
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:39,022
Class is in session.

46
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,713
You're awesome.
You should be in the NBA.

47
00:01:58,785 --> 00:01:59,809
My name's Felix.

48
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,012
Good for you.

49
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,486
Hey, hook me up
with some of that, man.

50
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:03,920
Shot was off.

51
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,618
The big guy made a bunch
of lucky shots anyway.

52
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,422
W- w-wait, hold up, dog.

53
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,827
Hey, you want
to run that back?

54
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,627
Ball.

55
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,132
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?

56
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,294
Come on,
what you gonna do?

57
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,564
Come on.
Come on.

58
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,538
You ain't got it.
You ain't got nothing.

59
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,133
Ah, get some!

60
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:28,442
Ah, stuffed like a turkey!

61
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:29,482
Booyah!

62
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,342
I don't think so.

63
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,853
Go play piano!

64
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,621
Access denied!

65
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,352
Ah, access denied!

66
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:41,586
<i>Come on,
you want some of this?</i>

67
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,855
Yeah, get him!

68
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:46,989
Where you going?
Where you going?

69
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:47,998
Where you going?

70
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,763
That's where you're going.

71
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,065
Who's lucky now, huh?

72
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,867
What you looking at?

73
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,979
Aw, yeah.

74
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,014
Yeah, you better step off.

75
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,276
Hey, this is my neighborhood.

76
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,476
Who's the master?

77
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:06,576
You are.

78
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,018
And what's my name?

79
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:09,054
Chris?

80
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,089
Call me C-Dub.

81
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,283
And what time is it?

82
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,655
3:35.

83
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,785
Dog, dog, when I ask you
what time it is,

84
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,921
you're supposed to say
"game time," all right?

85
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,055
Wait, wait,
what time is it?

86
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,429
Game time.

87
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,593
No, no, no, on the reals, man.
What time is it?

88
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,636
3:35.

89
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,761
Mother...

90
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,069
All right, man,
I'm sorry I'm late, man.

91
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,341
There was this big-ass accident
on the 405, man.

92
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,212
This mofo was speeding,
picking his nose, man.

93
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,410
His ass ran, pow, right into
the back of a chicken truck.

94
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:40,782
Man, I saw blood.

95
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,878
<i>There was glass, blood,
feathers, everywhere, man.</i>

96
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,218
<i>I'm telling you, J.P.,</i>

97
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,554
<i>you should've seen
this wang ba dan, man.</i>

98
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,651
He might as well have been down
on his hands and knees.

99
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,695
He was begging me to stay.

100
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,161
I swear on the grace

101
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,789
of 18 generations
of my ancestors, man.

102
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,230
I ain't gonna be
late again.

103
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,325
All right, you can't get
a better guarantee than that

104
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,664
from a Chinese brother.

105
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,364
You know what
you had to do, right?

106
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,406
Don't playa-hate.

107
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:01,462
Negotiate.

108
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,974
For sure, so check it.

109
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,567
This fool starts talking fast
about bonuses, vacation days.

110
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,272
Man, he tried
to straight-up bribe me.

111
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,144
I'll give you my autographed
Michael Jordan jersey, man.

112
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,375
You know how much
that's worth?

113
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,644
Really?

114
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,481
All right, maybe I ain't
going to give you that,

115
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,418
but, hey, I'll give you
my Larry Johnson jersey.

116
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,648
Who?

117
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,588
You know, UNLV, Charlotte
Hornets, Grandma-ma.

118
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,455
Come on, man.
I'll wash your car, man.

119
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:21,652
Right, r-r-r-right.

120
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:22,695
So you had to show him

121
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,195
<i>who was the real
lao fan, huh?</i>

122
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,630
Oh, man, you know it, baby.
Set the record straight.

123
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,497
We ain't building railroads
for free no more, you hear?

124
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,002
Hey, man, how you
going to reach out

125
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,197
to your Asian customers, man?

126
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,467
Hey, they feel me,
feel me, man?

127
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,098
There's like 2 million of us
in L.A., man.

128
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:37,733
How you going
to communicate with them?

129
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,834
Wilson?

130
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,411
I was thinking, man.

131
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,281
Can't be wasting all my time
working for the man.

132
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:47,376
Right.

133
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,715
You know that comic book
I was working on,

134
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,346
the one with the gun-toting,
crime-fighting pandas?

135
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,754
That's where I need
to devote more of my time.

136
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,815
Yeah, and don't forget
about our T-shirt company.

137
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,326
That's what I'm saying, man.

138
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,022
And then
there's the casino.

139
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,791
Aw, can't forget
the crown jewel.

140
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,332
Cha-Ching Dynasty.

141
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,367
Booyah.

142
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,662
Hey.

143
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,100
Make money, money,

144
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,228
make money, money, make.

145
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,829
You know what
the Donald says?

146
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:09,136
Ah, wait,
you can't fire me, dog.

147
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,507
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, 'cause I quit.

148
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,218
Hm.

149
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,240
Oh, you're too polite.

150
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,835
I'm just a lousy player.

151
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:50,144
Not everybody can play
like that guy.

152
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,514
Hey, Pa, I fixed your modem.

153
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,678
<i>You should really think
about going wireless, though.</i>

154
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:55,812
It's a lot faster.

155
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,856
Hey, Michael,
you remember Mr. Lin?

156
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:58,982
Oh, of course.

157
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,588
Tournament's coming up.

158
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,186
You training hard?

159
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:05,230
Not that you need to.

160
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,731
You could probably win
blindfolded.

161
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:07,993
I'm just very lucky.

162
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,466
I definitely
should practice more.

163
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,435
Oh, I don't see how
you could find the time.

164
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,096
I got a nephew
in residency at General.

165
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,434
They're killing him
over there.

166
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,372
Well, my hospital's
definitely going to kill me

167
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:17,568
if I don't get back
right now,

168
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:18,769
so... good to see you.

169
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,109
- See you later.
- Pa.

170
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,670
Bye.

171
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,751
William?

172
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,587
He's too lazy...

173
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,685
and fat.

174
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:02,939
Ah, tell Mike, man.

175
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,141
He ain't doing nothing.

176
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,548
Doing nothing?

177
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,848
Yeah, but he don't have to work
on Saturday morning.

178
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,289
All right, all right,
all right!

179
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:22,456
<i>Ow.</i>

180
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:26,867
What up, playa?

181
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,236
<i>Oh, man,
what time is it?</i>

182
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:31,799
Time for you
to get your ass up, homey.

183
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,436
Man, aren't you supposed
to be in school?

184
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,537
<i>Yeah, it's recess.</i>

185
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:35,876
Hey, you need
to get down here.

186
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,848
No can, man, I told the dads
I was going to work.

187
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,680
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

188
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,686
I'll tell him later, man.
No biggie.

189
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,346
<i>All right,
but don't complain</i>

190
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,515
when everybody tells you
they seen the new ride.

191
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,617
Hold up.
You got a new ride?

192
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,661
I'll see you in a minute.

193
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,562
Sweet.

194
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,320
Thud!

195
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,498
Ow.

196
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,474
Oh,.

197
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,204
Man, I was going
to tell you later, man.

198
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,407
I mean, you and Mom
have been bugging me

199
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,010
to lose that lame-ass job
anyway, right?

200
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,077
Hey, so check it out, man.

201
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,589
I got an email
from my friend Ian

202
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,353
about how his friend opened up
an online clothing store, man.

203
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,792
He works from home, man.

204
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,455
He makes like a few thousand
dollars, man, every month, man.

205
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,897
I said, "Hey, let me key in
on some of that. "

206
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,594
And then,
you know Henry, right?

207
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,727
Hey, he self-published
this comic book last month.

208
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,362
I'm going to talk to him
about that too.

209
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,237
I mean, he got, like, his own
website and everything, man.

210
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,299
Yo, you feeling me
on this?

211
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,344
Mr. Waaang?

212
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,242
It's Wang, dog.

213
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,245
I'm sorry, "Wong. "

214
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:16,838
Wang, not Wong.
Wang.

215
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,008
- "Wong. "
- Wang.

216
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,574
- "Wong. "
- Wang.

217
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,620
- "Wong. "
- Is she all right?

218
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:22,654
<i>Good news.</i>

219
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:23,984
<i>Yourwrists
are just sprained.</i>

220
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,024
<i>You'll need
to take it easy for a while.</i>

221
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:30,256
You can start physical therapy
in a couple weeks.

222
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,318
Just goes to show you

223
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,092
you can never be
too careful driving.

224
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,656
Wait, wait, hold up, dog.
What's that supposed to mean?

225
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,100
Excuse me?

226
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,659
You just assume that just
because my moms is Chinese

227
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:39,705
that she's a bad driver?

228
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,069
Like she couldn't break her hand

229
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,937
gardening or baking pies,
some Martha Stewart.

230
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,101
Hey, that's straight-up
racialism, dog.

231
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:45,302
You better have
malpractice insurance.

232
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,606
I just read her chart.

233
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,237
It said
"car accident" on it.

234
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,838
Yeah, so?

235
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,406
This is for the pain.

236
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,783
The nurse
will sign you out.

237
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:01,823
Ow.

238
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,490
I'm okay.

239
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,001
They gave you
ibuprofen, huh?

240
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,470
We should make sure
you get the good stuff, okay?

241
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:14,767
We'll get you Vicodin, Ma.

242
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,490
Oh, wait a minute now.

243
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,592
People always think that,
you know, Chinese people,

244
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,000
all they're good at are math,

245
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,868
martial arts,
and mu shu pork, you know?

246
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:50,431
But basketball, hey, that was
really my thing back in the day,

247
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,476
you know what I'm saying?

248
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,307
I used to play
on the JV squad.

249
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,744
Booyah.

250
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,577
<i>They called me
The Orient Express.</i>

251
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,981
They call me The Orient Express
for more than one reason.

252
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,245
You know what I'm saying?

253
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,446
Feel me, man?
Feel that?

254
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,546
Actually, I don't.

255
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:05,681
<i>Uh...</i>

256
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:19,095
A, B, C.

257
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,105
A, G, C.

258
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,471
A, B, C.

259
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,669
Superstar.

260
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,713
Nerds.

261
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,776
Yeah, homeboy
was on the news last week.

262
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,286
Supposed to be
some kind of genius.

263
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,947
So when we going
to play some ball, man?

264
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,218
Oh, no, man.
I got that thing later.

265
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,624
Oh, that's right.
Ping-Pong.

266
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:16,922
When you gonna get
a bowl cut?

267
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,691
I'm just helping out
my moms, man.

268
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,732
Kick her while she's down,
why don't you?

269
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,793
You're in Ping-Pong too?

270
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,394
No, dog,
I ain't in Ping-Pong.

271
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,496
I'm teaching Ping-Pong.

272
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:28,733
Awesome!

273
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,174
I'm in that class!

274
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:46,691
This it?

275
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,023
Yep.

276
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,426
All right,
all right.

277
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,125
What's going on,
everybody?

278
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,498
<i>Come on over.</i>

279
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,569
Is it true that Coach Wang
broke ten bones?

280
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,574
I heard they had to
cut off her arm.

281
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,405
What are you smoking?

282
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:06,671
All y'all need to know is,

283
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,508
I'm going to be teaching
for a little while.

284
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:09,548
Who are you?

285
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,207
I'm Chris,
but call me C-Dub.

286
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,046
Are you the guy that wins

287
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,245
the Ping-Pong tournament
every single year?

288
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,413
No.

289
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:17,420
But isn't Coach Wang
your mom?

290
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:18,979
That's her other son.

291
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,618
Yeah, better
get that straight.

292
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,252
- What's your name?
- William.

293
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,626
Free Willy,
listen up.

294
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,925
Don't ask stupid questions,

295
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,590
and you won't get
stupid answers.

296
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,725
All right, the rest of y'all,
come up here real quick.

297
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,531
Put a check
next to your name.

298
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,834
Hey, what's your name again?

299
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:34,873
Felix.

300
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,771
F- Bomb, hey.

301
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,241
What's the deal
with the white boys?

302
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,244
<i>Coach Wang
lets them practice here.</i>

303
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,212
<i>They're, like, pros
or something.</i>

304
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:44,976
All right, whatever.

305
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,951
<i>So what y'all
normally do?</i>

306
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,749
We usually warm up first.

307
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:50,789
Coach Wang always says...

308
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,050
Ah, t-t-t-t.

309
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,819
Don't just stand there
and tell me about it.

310
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,190
Step to it.

311
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,269
We're done.

312
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,270
20 forehands
and 20 backhands each.

313
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:07,600
Well, good for you.

314
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:08,731
Now do another 20.

315
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,535
Make that 30.

316
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,779
Aw, yeah.

317
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,658
What's up, playa?

318
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,250
Oh, I see you got
your eye on that.

319
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,488
So what's the holdup?

320
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,154
Aw, man,
you can't just run up

321
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,630
and start
humping her leg like a dog.

322
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,530
You got to be
like a tiger, man.

323
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,193
You got to stalk the prey.

324
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,430
You got to wait for it
and then...

325
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,803
bam,
pounce on that.

326
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,739
Yeah, I feel you
on that, man.

327
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,073
<i>I feel you.</i>

328
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,737
Hey, what you up to, man?

329
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,974
<i>Joe put that issue of Hellboy
on hold for me.</i>

330
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,175
Aw, man, I got to work.

331
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,239
On Saturday?

332
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,478
Work sucks, man.

333
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,247
Oh, I forgot.
You wouldn't know.

334
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,583
Ah, it's like that, huh?

335
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,282
I help you out
with your Chinese homework,

336
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,415
and this is how
you repay me?

337
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:00,924
Don't worry.

338
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:03,257
When I'm making my millions
in the exploding China market,

339
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,354
I'll be sure to cut you in
on a little RNB.

340
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,796
Yeah, you better.

341
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,560
Oh, hey, keys.

342
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,692
How long?

343
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:12,236
Brother's car
is still in the shop.

344
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,271
Later.

345
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,670
Take care of my baby.

346
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,851
My rims keep shining,
and my paint keeps chipping.

347
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:35,087
My rims,
m- my, my rims keep shining.

348
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,027
My rims keep shining,
and my paint keeps chipping.

349
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:41,294
My rims,
m- my, my rims keep shining.

350
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,665
My rims keep shining,
and my paint keeps chipping.

351
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,135
<i>So glad you came by.</i>

352
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,865
<i>Well, I was
in the neighborhood.</i>

353
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,770
<i>I wanted to step in
and check on things.</i>

354
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,604
<i>Just give him
a few more days.</i>

355
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,667
<i>He's starting to practice
a little already.</i>

356
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:56,545
Well, everyone at the ATTF
will be happy to hear that.

357
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,379
It's always a treat watching
Michael defend his title.

358
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,009
About the sponsorship...

359
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,714
We can talk about it
once Michael's recovered.

360
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,314
And I hope Mei
is feeling better too.

361
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,552
Just goes to show you,

362
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,618
you can never be too careful
when driving.

363
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,254
Excuse me.
How much are these?

364
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,298
'Cause I'm kind of
in a hurry.

365
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,457
Well, I can see you're busy.

366
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,933
I'll call you later.

367
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,629
<i>We'll see you soon.</i>

368
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,868
Hey, I ain't the rude one.

369
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,637
Cheryl Davis
is the regional director

370
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,372
of the table tennis federation.

371
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,970
So? It don't give her the right

372
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,448
to perpetuate
racial stereotypes.

373
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,848
What do you want?

374
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,386
Ma, I don't know
if I can teach that class.

375
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,450
That's not
what I'm talking about.

376
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,752
It's boring, man.

377
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,383
I ain't trying to coach
no Bad News Bears.

378
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,058
Come on, man.
It's not my thing.

379
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,564
Make Michael
teach the class then.

380
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,766
Hey, I play sports,
not games.

381
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,797
The Chinese, we're the masters
of Ping-Pong.

382
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,002
You always say
Chinese this and Chinese that,

383
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,739
but all you want to do
is play basketball.

384
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,373
Do you see any Chinese people
playing in the NBA?

385
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,609
As a matter of fact...

386
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,270
<i>China!</i>

387
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,795
Man, are you still trying to
play in that stupid tournament?

388
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,993
Everything's always stupid
to you, isn't it, Chris?

389
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,365
That's 'cause I know you, man.

390
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,166
You just want to go
to that dumb-ass parade.

391
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,968
I can see your future,

392
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,374
and you are not going on a date
with Miss Chinatown.

393
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,845
It's not about
Miss Chinatown.

394
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,506
You just love
the Miss Chinatown, though.

395
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,277
Well, at least
I've got standards.

396
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,717
Is that what you're calling
the Ten Commandments these days?

397
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,378
There are only eight, Chris.

398
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:19,652
You find an Ivy League graduate
who's over 5'6",

399
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:23,320
can sing, run a six-minute mile,
and look good in a bikini,

400
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,623
and is interested in you,

401
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:27,790
there's still
something wrong with her.

402
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,495
You think that's why I play
in the tournament every year?

403
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,130
Does Yao Ming
like Chinese food?

404
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,504
Oh, my God,
you're so stupid.

405
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,805
Listen, genius,
this is how it works, okay?

406
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,402
I play in the tournament.
Then I win the tournament.

407
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,004
Now, all the Chinese parents
out there,

408
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,139
they get really excited,

409
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,081
and they put their kids
in our classes,

410
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,175
which Mom teaches.

411
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,152
Then they buy
the gear in our store.

412
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,815
And ultimately, that gives us
money to pay for the Wheaties

413
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,687
you stick up your ass
every morning.

414
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,249
<i>It is Marketing 101.</i>

415
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,420
Wow, did you come up
with that yourself?

416
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,895
Shut up.

417
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,831
Chris, you need to get a job.

418
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,094
<i>And I'm not talking about</i>

419
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,363
<i>hawking cell phones
at the mall, okay?</i>

420
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:06,870
I'm talking about a real job,

421
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,304
so you can make
some real money

422
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,238
so you can move your ass
out of the house

423
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,504
<i>and maybe just stop living
over the garage</i>

424
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,773
like some sort
of yellow Fonzie.

425
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:16,677
<i>There's some admin work
over at the hospital.</i>

426
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,079
All the time I've known you...

427
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,175
No, I ain't going to work
in no hospital, please.

428
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,810
Well, dude,
figure it out, okay,

429
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,583
'cause I'm tired of hearing it
from Ma and Pa all the time.

430
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:25,884
Well, now you know
how I feel.

431
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,755
No, I don't, 'cause this
is not my fault, Chris.

432
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,885
Hey, this whole effed-up
situation is your fault.

433
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,863
Oh, please, elaborate.

434
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:36,332
You're just
a terrible driver, dog.

435
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,368
Ow.

436
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,494
That was going in, man.

437
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,594
You ever see you drive, huh?

438
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:40,968
- At least I got a car.
- Ma!

439
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,233
<i>Yeah, call for Mama.</i>

440
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,400
"Stop. "

441
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:45,500
<i>Ow.</i>

442
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,374
Yeah, homey.

443
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,006
You don't think if I was 7'6"
like Yao Ming,

444
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,676
that I wouldn't be dunking on
fools all over the place, man?

445
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,015
I mean, even if I was just 6'6",
you know?

446
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,783
I mean, and not to say that
if I was black or white that,

447
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,983
you know, I'd be the next,
you know, Kobe Bryant

448
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:02,322
or Manu Ginobili,
you know, but...

449
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:05,386
all I'm saying is that I'd be
at least a Moochie Norris,

450
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,227
you know, or at least
a Mark Madsen,

451
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,664
at the very least,
you know?

452
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,861
Chinese people
are just not meant

453
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,528
to be tall, man,
you know?

454
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,368
We're good at badminton,
fencing, stuff like...

455
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,930
I don't know.

456
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,477
You know, like gymnastics
and, man, Ping-Pong.

457
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:20,511
Ah!

458
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,525
Man, we should be running
some ball right now, feel me?

459
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:35,560
I feel you.

460
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,026
Take it from me, man.

461
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,359
Unless you want to become
the Chinese Napoleon Dynamite,

462
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,398
get out of Ping-Pong.

463
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,432
Got it?

464
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,797
Got it.

465
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,631
I'm just here
'cause my moms is hurt.

466
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,432
<i>Otherwise, I'd be taking it
to the hole, man,</i>

467
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,496
<i>crossing fools over.</i>

468
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,939
<i>Did I ever tell you about that
championship game at district?</i>

469
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,341
<i>Man, it was awesome.</i>

470
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,902
<i>There was this
half-court shot, man.</i>

471
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,777
<i>It was like football field
delivery, man.</i>

472
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,179
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

473
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,913
Chubby, let me show you
the backhand serve.

474
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:06,287
<i>Ah, hey, I got this.
I got this.</i>

475
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,826
Sure thing, coach.

476
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,919
Free Willy, man,
you working too hard, man.

477
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,021
You don't need to swing it
like a baseball bat, man.

478
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:16,966
Just chop it, all right?

479
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,002
Thanks.

480
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,662
That's awesome.

481
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,035
Teach me too.

482
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,267
Class is over, F-Bomb.

483
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,809
What did I tell you anyway?

484
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:27,310
You better start working
on your jump shot.

485
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,710
Please?

486
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,675
I'll give you $10.

487
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,827
Whoo!

488
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,870
Game over, man, game over.

489
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,838
Again. Again.

490
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,134
Aw, come on, man.

491
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,369
I got to get going.

492
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,343
Please?

493
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,039
All right, you
talked me into it.

494
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,706
Yes.

495
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,512
You have a reputation for being
sort of hard on the children.

496
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,109
Why is that?

497
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,450
Look, I'm just trying
to keep it real, all right?

498
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,387
I'm trying to teach them
life lessons, you know,

499
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,448
so they don't have to go
through all the pain

500
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:15,891
and humiliation and suffering

501
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,895
that I had to go through,
you know what I'm saying?

502
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,658
What do you mean
by "suffering"?

503
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,222
You know, man, you think
my parents supported my dream

504
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,234
of becoming the first
Chinese player in the NBA?

505
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:26,270
Man, hell, no, man,
it was always about, you know,

506
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:29,000
"Go study, hit the books,"
man, "Go play violin. "

507
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,632
And you feel that held you back?

508
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:31,971
Hell, yeah, man.

509
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:34,375
I mean, dude, look at
my one Chinese brother, man.

510
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,846
His parents made him play the
accordion for ten years, man.

511
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,405
Look at what happened to him.

512
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:39,711
What happened?

513
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,719
Homey's in tech support
now, man.

514
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:45,382
It hurts me, dog.
It hurts me.

515
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:49,018
I'm sorry.

516
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,186
Don't touch me.

517
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:56,929
Aw, yeah.

518
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,993
Hey.

519
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,799
What you doing?

520
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,999
Man, I'm just trying
to holler at some honeys.

521
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:04,132
Feel me?

522
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,267
You mean that girl?

523
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:06,742
Hey, don't point like that.

524
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,609
That's not a honey.
That's my sister.

525
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,647
For real?

526
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,011
Damn, man, all this time,

527
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:12,879
why didn't you tell me
your sister was a hottie?

528
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,179
Ew.

529
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:15,947
Hey, she isn't
one of those girls

530
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,181
that only dates white boys,
is she?

531
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,222
You want to help
a brother out?

532
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,621
Okay.

533
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:22,182
Just tell your sister
about Ping-Pong class

534
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,125
and how cool your teacher is
and stuff, all right?

535
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,185
All right.

536
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:26,696
But don't be obvious or nothing.

537
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,562
Just tell her, like, you know,
how your day went and all that

538
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,793
and your teacher
just happens to be

539
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,028
this really cool guy; got it?

540
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:32,831
Oh, good-looking too.
Don't forget that.

541
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:33,871
And good at basketball.

542
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,133
Got it.

543
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,471
All right. My ninja.

544
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:45,845
My ninja.

545
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,140
I want it.

546
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,480
You deserve it.

547
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,316
<i>A- Train, hand over that PSP
and go with B-Diddy over here.</i>

548
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,788
Hey, what did I tell you about
eating dried squid in class?

549
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,381
Man, you got
to take that outside.

550
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,425
That's him.

551
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,393
He's awesome.

552
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:10,865
What you doing, dog?

553
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,563
That's Henry.
He's from Manila.

554
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:14,127
Yeah, so?

555
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:16,571
He said he's better than
everyone at Chinese school.

556
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,666
That's why he doesn't
take Ping-Pong here.

557
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,108
I said you could beat him.

558
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:22,373
Come on, man.
I got a class to teach, man.

559
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,972
Plus, you know I haven't really
played in a little while.

560
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,483
Please?

561
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:29,019
I'll give you some money.

562
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,384
Ooh.

563
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:31,752
What if I lose?

564
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:33,620
You can still have it.

565
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,819
All right, hold up a second.

566
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:37,225
<i>Free Willy,
Adam.</i>

567
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:42,895
What you doing, dog?

568
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:45,027
Don't you know that "boba"
is Chinese for "boob"?

569
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,035
You know why?

570
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,332
You drink enough of it,

571
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:48,633
that's what you're
going to get, man boobs.

572
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,072
Is that what you want?

573
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:52,803
Is it?

574
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:54,640
All right, you're going
to be my scorekeeper.

575
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,738
Watch and learn,
all right?

576
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:57,941
All right.

577
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,386
Game over, sucker.

578
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,757
<i>Kablamo!</i>

579
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,090
We showed him.

580
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:15,292
All the way back
to Chan Marino.

581
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,335
You got any more friends?

582
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:28,869
You got to rock
to the rhythm with 'em.

583
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,312
Got to give it to 'em.

584
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,282
Got to give a lot more
than the minimum.

585
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,977
Rock to the rhythm
with 'em.

586
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,144
Got to give it to 'em.

587
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,484
Got to give a lot more,
more, more.

588
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:38,817
Yo, wake up,
wake up.

589
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:39,948
It's a new day now.

590
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,219
Side step, right, left,

591
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,725
move when I break down.

592
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:43,818
How I get down?

593
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,385
Make 'em all sit down.

594
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:49,024
Either that or have them
hurrying to skip town.

595
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,567
Yeah, you're just like
good tobacco,

596
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:53,502
<i>'cause I just put you
in my pipe and smoked you.</i>

597
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:55,664
There you go.

598
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,674
Yeah, hey,
time to go to bed, old man.

599
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:02,906
Thanks for your business.

600
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:05,609
A pleasure to serve you.

601
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:06,651
Who's next?

602
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:07,685
That's it.

603
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:09,049
That's it?

604
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,747
Come on, man.
That's like barely 40 bucks.

605
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,813
Man, where are
all your rich friends?

606
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,130
You got something to say,
come say it to my face.

607
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,393
You're a real boon
to the sport of table tennis.

608
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,867
You're using your mom's class
to hustle suckers.

609
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:26,096
What did you say
about my mama?

610
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,729
All he's saying is,
maybe these students

611
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,467
deserve someone
a little more qualified.

612
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,872
Oh, you know,
all right, let's go.

613
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:32,273
Come on, what you want
to play for?

614
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:36,143
Please; whatever happened
to playing for sport?

615
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:39,505
All right,
you know what?

616
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,211
I got a few minutes
to kill.

617
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,054
Booyah.

618
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,859
Take my coat.

619
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,365
Oh, that's a bad China word.

620
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:58,095
Okay, first to 11 wins.

621
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,330
Skunk at 7.

622
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,285
- Come on, C-Dub.
- Do it. Booyah!

623
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:19,823
Two more points.

624
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,051
<i>I think I smell skunk.</i>

625
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:22,718
<i>Smells pretty good to me.</i>

626
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,261
Sorry, chum.

627
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,126
I got some more important
business to attend to.

628
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:27,824
Oh, he's walking away.

629
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,161
Gee, I'm shocked.

630
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,896
F- Bomb, finish up
with this fool.

631
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,665
Can we switch scores?

632
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:34,932
No.

633
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,064
<i>Hi, how you doing?</i>

634
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:37,233
<i>Hi.</i>

635
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,067
Yeah, I seen you around.

636
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,408
You play Ping-Pong?

637
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,107
Are you the instructor,

638
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,116
the guy that's been stealing
my brother's allowance?

639
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:47,446
Oh, wait, wait, hold on.
No, no, no.

640
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,486
You got the wrong dude.

641
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:49,679
That's the guy you want.

642
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,381
<i>That kid?</i>

643
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,151
<i>He's like a Ping-Pong prodigy
or something.</i>

644
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:54,691
- I'm serious.
- Really?

645
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,386
Yeah, he was on the news
the other day, man.

646
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,361
News lady said he's, like,
a genius or something.

647
00:29:58,429 --> 00:29:59,418
Okay, thanks.

648
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:21,845
I like, I like,
I like cereal.

649
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,480
Don't put the box away;
I'm about to have me some more.

650
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,854
My favorite kinds
was made by Meneral Gills.

651
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,291
Big spoon, big bowl,
I got minimal spills.

652
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,657
I ain't finished
about yet.

653
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:31,752
In a minute,
I will.

654
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,354
While I'm
getting my cartoon,

655
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,921
it comes
from cinema thrills.

656
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,365
<i>I be watching Master Killer
chomping 'Zilla Vanilla.</i>

657
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:40,063
Maybe grape, that's the one
that had the purple gorilla.

658
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:41,503
I crunch,
Chumpster Hunch Munch,

659
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:43,063
watch the Dukes
doing stunt jumps.

660
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,735
Christopher...

661
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:51,304
Christopher?

662
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:53,373
You got to be kidding.

663
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:54,543
Why not?

664
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:55,950
He has enough
free time now.

665
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,009
Ma, no way.

666
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,077
No way.

667
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:03,419
All he does is play video games
and read comic books all day.

668
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:05,486
No way.

669
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,496
Ma, this wasn't my fault.

670
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:23,836
Booyah!

671
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,119
Man, I'm telling you, man,

672
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:31,951
if I was just
one inch taller, man,

673
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:34,548
I'd be dunking
all the time, man.

674
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:41,031
Tomahawk, windmill, 360-degree
peanut butter and jam sandwich.

675
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,293
Uh!

676
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:47,198
<i>Yeah, so we going to run
another game orwhat?</i>

677
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:48,432
<i>We can take these jabronis.</i>

678
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:49,734
<i>Can't.
I gotta go.</i>

679
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:50,774
Where?

680
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,833
Birthday party.

681
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,344
I don't even want to go.

682
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,572
Well, then, don't go.

683
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:56,841
My sister's making me.

684
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,348
Man, and another thing, man.

685
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,145
Why you have to go all off
and tell your sister

686
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,344
about what we were doing, man?

687
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,716
I thought we was tight.

688
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:04,448
You said to tell her
about Ping-Pong class.

689
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:06,752
That means telling her
that you play Ping-Pong,

690
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,485
not that you
play Ping-Pong for money.

691
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,720
Just tell her that you made
all that up, all right?

692
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:13,059
I'm not as good
at lying as you are.

693
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,996
Hold up; Why you got to be
hurtful, man?

694
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:16,533
I'm not asking you
to lie, man.

695
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,762
I'm just asking you
to finesse the truth.

696
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:19,825
You got it?

697
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:20,996
Okay.

698
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,666
So where
this party at, man?

699
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,108
<i>Geometrically speaking,</i>

700
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:36,517
<i>the probability of striking
all ten pins is highest</i>

701
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:40,489
when the ball enters formation
at a 45-degree angle.

702
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,250
<i>That didn't work.</i>

703
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,321
Perhaps I should try
launching with more force.

704
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:51,702
Thud!

705
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:58,864
It's a shame,
isn't it?

706
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:00,877
What's that,
the nerds?

707
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,537
Matter of speaking, yes.

708
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:04,046
The birthday boy guy,

709
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,379
he's the biggest nerd
of them all.

710
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:09,352
Yes, my son,
the biggest nerd.

711
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,615
Oh, I didn't mean it
like that.

712
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:14,157
No, no, no,
it's quite all right.

713
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:15,817
It's a thing
with my son.

714
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:18,987
What good is it being able to
play Rachmaninoff at age six

715
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:21,054
<i>if you don't have
an audience to play for, huh?</i>

716
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:22,963
<i>Hey, man, I don't mean
no disrespect,</i>

717
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,696
but he ain't going to make no
friends warming a piano bench.

718
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:26,896
You know what I'm saying?

719
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,871
You have a point.

720
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,998
Oh, D.B. Reddy.

721
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,041
C- Dub.

722
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,167
I'm here
with my boy, Felix.

723
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:33,210
Oh.

724
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:34,403
Speak of the devil.

725
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:35,741
What's up?

726
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,713
Yo, yo, yo.

727
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:44,983
Yeah, F-Bomb, eh,
this is Prabakar's dad.

728
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,455
Hello, Felix.
Welcome.

729
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,991
Please,
make yourself comfortable.

730
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,390
There's some
pepperoni pizza.

731
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,825
<i>Cool, thanks.</i>

732
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,294
Amazing.

733
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,523
This boy,
he is your...

734
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,065
That's my basketball homey.

735
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,930
Oh, you're
his basketball teacher.

736
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:58,969
Uh, I actually
teach him Ping-Pong

737
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,265
at the Chinese school.

738
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,499
Ah, is that
your primary occupation?

739
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,268
No, no, no.

740
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,242
I'm actually getting ready
to start up a business

741
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,504
with a friend of mine,
you know?

742
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:09,068
We're going to press
some comic books,

743
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,205
start our own clothing line.

744
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:11,839
You know,
entrepreneurial-type stuff.

745
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,645
Fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic.

746
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,685
Yeah.

747
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:16,743
I was just like you
starting out,

748
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:20,518
less than $100 in my pocket
when I came from India.

749
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:22,718
And now I own
my own textile company.

750
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:23,852
That's tight, man.

751
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:25,361
That's like
kitchen tiles and stuff?

752
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,954
Oh, no, no, no.

753
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:30,194
Textiles as in fabric
for clothing and shoes.

754
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:31,599
Oh, oh, my bad.

755
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:33,967
No, it's quite all right,
my friend.

756
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,733
Well, I wish you luck
in your endeavors.

757
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,468
I think you have
what it takes.

758
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:38,839
Yo, for real?

759
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,138
You think
I could roll like you?

760
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,975
Listen, most people
underestimate

761
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:46,574
the social skills needed
to succeed in business.

762
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:49,279
Prabakar doesn't need
more math classes.

763
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:50,911
He needs to learn
to socialize,

764
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:53,752
to be a kid.

765
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,292
Yeah, so I ask you,

766
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,486
would you take on my son
as one of your disciples?

767
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,894
Disciple?

768
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:01,956
Yeah!

769
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,365
I like the sound of that.

770
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:11,642
Prepare for practice games,
y'all.

771
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,802
What do I do,
Coach Chris?

772
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:14,867
Call me C-Dub.

773
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:15,935
- L...
- Oh, you know what?

774
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:17,344
I got a better idea.

775
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,404
<i>Call me sifu.</i>

776
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:19,950
<i>Yes, sifu.</i>

777
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:22,850
I've done some studying
on the physics of table tennis.

778
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,785
Practice.
Don't talk.

779
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,153
See that over there?

780
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,691
That's for you.

781
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,988
Practice until you can hit it
back to yourself ten times...

782
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:31,460
That should be quite...

783
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:32,496
In a row.

784
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:53,709
I've been watching you.

785
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:56,275
I think you could be
a brilliant paddler.

786
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:57,321
Paddler?

787
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:58,946
It's Felix, right?

788
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,547
Yeah.

789
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,059
Your forehand smash
could use a bit of tinkering,

790
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:05,220
and your teacher's
been rather busy.

791
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:09,790
<i>Anyway, I am opening a new
school in a couple of weeks,</i>

792
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:10,856
all brand-new tables.

793
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:12,903
You should come down,
check it out.

794
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:13,994
Here, you know what?

795
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,561
Take a couple.
Put them in your pocket.

796
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,607
Give them to your parents.

797
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,971
<i>Hey, hey, hey.</i>

798
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:20,340
Don't be passing out no porno
to none of my kids, yo.

799
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:21,844
No worries, m'laddo.

800
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,143
Just offering a little friendly
advice to my buddy here.

801
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:26,149
Yeah, we ain't buying
your opium around here.

802
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,651
Sure thing,
Chrissie.

803
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,277
Booyah!

804
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:33,684
'Sup with
Prince Charles, man?

805
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,225
You got a question
you can't ask me?

806
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:36,692
I can't smash it
like you.

807
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:37,728
Let me see.

808
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:38,762
Free Willy,
balls.

809
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,091
All right.

810
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,094
Dog, you got no energy
in your swing, man.

811
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:46,796
Pull your arm
back like this.

812
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,702
Angle it down like that,
all right?

813
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,001
Now swing away,
all right?

814
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,065
Like that,
okay?

815
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:55,475
Free Willy,
come on, man.

816
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,571
You're going to get chocolate
all over the balls, man.

817
00:36:57,648 --> 00:37:00,947
Ain't you tell me your dad
sent you here to lose weight?

818
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:02,815
Then why you keep bringing
candy to class, man?

819
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,218
I got a rep to uphold.

820
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,553
All right, just remember
what I showed you

821
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:12,118
and keep flapping
them back, okay?

822
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,634
All right,
here we go.

823
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:18,999
<i>Remember that angle.</i>

824
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,094
<i>There you go.</i>

825
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:21,331
<i>Come on,
smack that sucker.</i>

826
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,633
<i>Tell that white boy
who's boss.</i>

827
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:23,867
Ow.

828
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:32,544
Speaking of the competition,

829
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:34,346
are you entering
Miss Chinatown this year?

830
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,386
Because if you
don't mind me saying so,

831
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:39,218
you're certainly
beautiful enough to win.

832
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,781
<i>C- Dub in the hizzouse.</i>

833
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:46,990
Yo, J.P., money,
money, money, money, money.

834
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:48,224
What's up?

835
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,267
Speaking of which,
I was just telling my boy Felix,

836
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:52,928
we got a little cash money game
going on across the street.

837
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,028
Some of my boys
swinging by.

838
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,072
Come run with.

839
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:56,470
- Yeah.
- Oh, no, man.

840
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,564
I just finished class, man.

841
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:58,666
Hold up.

842
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,904
Now you too tired
from playing Ping-Pong?

843
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:02,343
Coaching, dog.

844
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:03,778
Responsibility's tiring.

845
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:07,409
Always one good excuse
after another from balling, man.

846
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:08,918
I haven't seen you
on a court since JV.

847
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:10,783
Aw, man, come on,
you know that ain't true, man.

848
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:13,085
You're too busy working
to see me in action anyway.

849
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:14,852
Come on, Orient Express.

850
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,222
I mean,
this is easy money.

851
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,455
It's just my boy Kev
and a bunch of old geezers.

852
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:20,087
Really?
Like how old-old?

853
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:21,358
Man, I don't know.

854
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:23,662
They're like grandpas
and.

855
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:25,759
My bad, homey.

856
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:27,827
All right, fine.
Let's roll.

857
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:31,534
This is a wake-up call
to all my hustlers on the block

858
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:32,803
trying to make some ball.

859
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:34,902
See, I told you, dog.
We got this.

860
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,674
J.P., what's up, boy?

861
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,305
What's up, homey?

862
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:40,577
This is my boy, C-Dub,
I was telling you about.

863
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,051
J.P. Tells me about
this last-second shot you hit

864
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,644
at district
back in the day.

865
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,121
Yeah, back in the day.

866
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,452
$30 to the winner, right?

867
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,152
Yo, $40.
You still owe me In-N-Out.

868
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:51,091
Oh, we gonna serve you
a Double-Double.

869
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,652
Just you wait.

870
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,924
Yo, let me hydrate first.

871
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:54,965
Then we run.

872
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:56,431
Whatever.

873
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,161
Hey, yo, man, I just want
to let you know, man,

874
00:38:58,235 --> 00:38:59,600
I haven't played
in a couple weeks.

875
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,570
Felix said
you played last week.

876
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,005
Don't sweat it, playa.
You got this.

877
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,269
All I'm saying is, man,

878
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,174
can't expect my regular
20-10 game, that's all.

879
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:10,372
When we clean these fools out,
Cinnabon's on me.

880
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:14,316
Cinnabons, baby.

881
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,293
Yo, I wish I was
a little bit taller.

882
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,589
I wish I was a baller.

883
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:25,993
I wish I had a girl
who looked good.

884
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:27,325
I would call her.

885
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:28,490
Wish I was a baller.

886
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,557
I wish I had,
I wish I had a 6-4 Impala.

887
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:31,760
Got to get tall.

888
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,030
Got to touch trees.

889
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,572
Got to show my hometown
it ain't anything.

890
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,971
Got to live large
with a black car.

891
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,670
Got to get my mom and dad
a brand-new yard.

892
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:43,305
Let's pretend I was seven-tr,
built like a tree

893
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,781
and a guy from east end,
and my man, Yao Ming,

894
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,410
got more bottle
'cause I'm living tall Gs.

895
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,920
I'll be a model
for a can of green beans.

896
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,684
You think it's funny,
but it ain't when you're broke.

897
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,817
It's like that
when the alarm is reset.

898
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,088
Try and sign a deal
but don't drop the soap.

899
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,562
If I roll a few feet,
then I know that there's hope.

900
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:02,531
I wish I was
a little bit taller.

901
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,760
I wish I was a baller.

902
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,131
I wish I had a girl
who looked good.

903
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:06,169
I would call her.

904
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,295
I wish I was a baller.

905
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:09,999
I wish I had,
I wish I had a 6-4 Impala.

906
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,564
Yo, I wish, wish, wish.

907
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:14,008
Wish, wish,
wish, wish.

908
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,219
Dad, dude,
calm down, man.

909
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:07,890
Take it easy, man.

910
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,262
That money's
for you and Mom, man.

911
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,698
I was saving it
to fix the car, man.

912
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,191
Michael don't even have
a girlfriend, man.

913
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,496
He's always trying to get
them ugly-ass Miss Chinatowns.

914
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,536
But he has a good job.

915
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:20,661
And he's responsible.

916
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,729
I'm running your class,
ain't I?

917
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,569
What else I got to do,
become Ping-Pong king?

918
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,377
Yeah, right.

919
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:38,918
Okay?

920
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,581
<i>Fine.</i>

921
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:46,997
They're never cute.

922
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,622
They always
look like newscasters

923
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,394
<i>cruising for prom dates.</i>

924
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:52,230
<i>Hey, remember
that cross-eyed one last year?</i>

925
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:53,964
<i>Hey, she looked
like a Chinese Lassie.</i>

926
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,061
Oh!

927
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:13,584
Nice mailbox.

928
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:14,885
Nice ride.

929
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,722
Zero to 30
in 8-flat.

930
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,762
Mm-hmm.

931
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:20,194
So I'm telling you, man.

932
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,232
She's just mad jocking me
from the start, man.

933
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:23,266
How's that?

934
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:25,325
The eyes, smoldering.

935
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:28,269
Genius child-prodigy
Ping-Pong teacher, huh?

936
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,903
Yeah.

937
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:32,965
That was kind of funny.

938
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:37,938
Yeah, so is Felix home?

939
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,006
What do you want?
He's doing his homework.

940
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:42,109
All right, playa, so you got
your game face on, huh?

941
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:44,347
Yeah, so you know,
she's all up in my grill, man,

942
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:45,445
trying to get up close, man.

943
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:46,955
And I said,
"Wait a damn minute now. "

944
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:49,015
No one takes a ride
on the Orient Express

945
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:51,084
without paying
for a ticket.

946
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:53,152
I just wanted to give
the little man his money back.

947
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,822
Got caught?

948
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:56,525
Hey, look, lady,
I'm just trying to be nice.

949
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,965
I won that money
fair and square.

950
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:00,435
You think taking money from
old people and third graders

951
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:03,166
is fair and square?

952
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,504
Come on, she gonna take a ride
on the Orient Express?

953
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,567
Hey, wait, don't go jumping
the line now, man.

954
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,011
First, all right, she starts
giving me the sweet talk, right?

955
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,310
Talking about how little F-Bomb
looks up to me and.

956
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,374
Aw, that's so sweet.

957
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:16,112
You know, I tried
to get my parents

958
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:17,585
to make him
stop going to your class,

959
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,054
but he convinced them
you're, like,

960
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:20,317
his best friend
or something.

961
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:21,483
F- Bomb said that?

962
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:22,752
Just shows
how mature you are.

963
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,657
Your best friend is still
in elementary school.

964
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:27,663
You're so funny.

965
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:29,289
You're just lucky
he's the only boy in our family.

966
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:30,663
My parents spoil him.

967
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:32,565
Yeah, well, maybe they know
what's good for him.

968
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:35,070
Hey, better me teaching him than
some pasty Hugh Grant wannabe.

969
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:36,436
<i>Yeah, I saw
y'all talking to him.</i>

970
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,702
Hey, we don't talk to no...

971
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:39,970
They are the enemy.

972
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,069
Please, like I chose
to have him breathing on me

973
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:43,704
and shoving his flyers
in my face.

974
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:45,408
Someone's got to put
that guy on a bus.

975
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:46,676
Hey, I feel you
on that.

976
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,115
So why don't you,

977
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,449
if you're so offended
by him taking your students?

978
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,647
Well, maybe I will.

979
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:52,689
Good.

980
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:53,723
- Yeah.
- Go ahead.

981
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,156
- All right.
- Get on it.

982
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:57,056
Hey, I'm on it.
Feel me?

983
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:58,424
No, thanks.

984
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,726
Hey, you know, we got
some room in the class

985
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:03,426
if you want
to swing on by, you know?

986
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,025
Or I could give you some
private lessons on the side.

987
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:08,731
You and me
and Ping-Pong.

988
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:10,831
We could leave F-Bomb
at my mom's house.

989
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:14,366
If my sorry-ass manager
don't lay off the Saturdays...

990
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:15,776
No, I don't...
What's this?

991
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:16,972
My treat, dog.

992
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,605
Well, I like
the sound of that.

993
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:20,013
Oh, sure.

994
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:21,483
Nice.

995
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,646
Hey, you know, I let you down
on the court the other day, man.

996
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,519
These are good
when they're hot, man.

997
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,490
Absolutely.

998
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,254
Listen, I didn't
want you to think

999
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:31,692
I was pulling
a Latrell Sprewell,

1000
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,024
so I didn't say nothing.

1001
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:34,997
My knee was acting up, man.

1002
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,999
Yeah, well,
ain't no thing.

1003
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,126
Those guys were just better,
that's all.

1004
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:40,397
Those geezers?

1005
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:41,995
Hey, come on, man,
be real.

1006
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,300
<i>You know if my knee
was 100% % %...</i>

1007
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:46,365
<i>Your knee has
never been 100% % %, man.</i>

1008
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:48,070
What's that
supposed to mean?

1009
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,772
You just ain't
a baller, man.

1010
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:52,281
Man, if you mad about
losing that money, man, hey...

1011
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,681
Dude, I knew I was going
to lose that money.

1012
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:55,946
You set me up, man?

1013
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:57,281
Double betting
on the side, man?

1014
00:45:57,354 --> 00:45:58,378
Come on, money.

1015
00:45:58,455 --> 00:45:59,888
You know you can count me
in on that...

1016
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:02,016
No, dog,
it's not like that.

1017
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,354
I was just trying
to help you

1018
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,985
face up to
your real skills, that's all.

1019
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:06,256
My real skills?

1020
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,763
Yeah, look,
we tight and all,

1021
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:09,856
but if I got to hear
about your genetic disadvantage,

1022
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,696
otherwise I'm gonna be
in the NBA bull

1023
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:12,895
One more time,
I swear to God,

1024
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,494
I'm going to have to
kill somebody.

1025
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:15,868
I mean,
even if you're 8 feet tall

1026
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,304
with a 12-pack, man,

1027
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:19,308
you ain't never going
to be no Kobe Bryant.

1028
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:21,970
Come on.

1029
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:24,172
What?

1030
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:26,546
Hey, C,
come on, man.

1031
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,828
<i>Hey, you got something to say,
just say it, man.</i>

1032
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:47,132
I just think you should cut
the wannabe crap, man.

1033
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:48,671
I mean, we're still
going to be homies.

1034
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:50,604
Hey, you think this is
about impressing you, man?

1035
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:51,868
Look at you, man,
salary man,

1036
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:53,773
9:00 to 5:00,
tied to the desk,

1037
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:55,607
playing ring around
the water cooler.

1038
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,977
You the one always talking
about the next big scheme, man.

1039
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:00,346
And Mr. Entrepreneur
don't even have a business card.

1040
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:01,509
I see.

1041
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:03,246
So the best defense
is a good offense, huh?

1042
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,912
Look, all I'm saying, man,

1043
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,819
better a wannabe
than a bean counter.

1044
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,289
Better a bean counter
than a loser.

1045
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:11,156
Hey, a loser is someone who
gives up the game, all right?

1046
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:13,389
No, no, a loser's somebody
who's got so many excuses

1047
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:15,192
they never get in the game
in the first place.

1048
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:16,630
Hey, you really
want to play this?

1049
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,167
How about this then?

1050
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:20,396
A loser's someone who takes
Chinese class for three years

1051
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,438
<i>and is still scared to order
dinner at Panda Express.</i>

1052
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,871
What?
Who?

1053
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:25,636
<i>What? You think I'm afraid
to use my Chinese?</i>

1054
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:26,676
Yeah.

1055
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:30,338
Wait.
Read my lips.

1056
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,849
Dog, dog, dog.

1057
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,579
What?
What'd I say?

1058
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:38,712
Are you trying to tell me
my basketball stinks?

1059
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:39,915
Yeah, and?

1060
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,651
All right,
try this, man.

1061
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:46,694
Right, right.

1062
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:52,765
Hey, dog,
that's harsh, man.

1063
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:53,962
That's just harsh.

1064
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:03,339
<i>Sifu, I read in my book</i>

1065
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:05,540
about the topspin
you have to put on the ball

1066
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:08,107
in order for it to have
a higher probability...

1067
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:09,914
Dog, before you start fretting
about topspin,

1068
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:11,215
you have to actually
hit the ball first.

1069
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:12,550
Ah, so one must...

1070
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:13,612
Ah, t-t-t-t.

1071
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:19,087
Unscrew it.

1072
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:20,595
That's what I'm trying to do.

1073
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:21,688
It's, like, welded.

1074
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:23,426
Unscrew the top.
Unscrew the top.

1075
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,024
- I tried the top.
- No, the other top.

1076
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:27,002
Listen, guys, you want to start
your own school?

1077
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,094
No problem.

1078
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,798
But you cannot take
our students.

1079
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:31,101
It's a free country.

1080
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:32,471
Kids can choose
their own school.

1081
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:33,907
Yeah, it's a free country.

1082
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:35,672
My wife
lets you practice here.

1083
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,213
You cannot do this.

1084
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:40,045
Can't handle a little
friendly competition.

1085
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:41,311
Fine.

1086
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:42,716
We'll go.

1087
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:44,686
I'm sick of watching
these kids waste their time

1088
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,120
with Conan the babysitter
anyway.

1089
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:47,417
If they want real training,

1090
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:49,220
they'll come learn
from the real masters,

1091
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:52,262
the ones who invented
table tennis.

1092
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:01,504
The Chinese
invented Ping-Pong.

1093
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:03,835
Still smoking the opium,
old man?

1094
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:05,204
That's so sad.

1095
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,840
Don't come back again.

1096
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:27,163
Hey, yo, Wonder Bread.

1097
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,663
Hey, you got a problem
with my family,

1098
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:29,824
you take it up with me.

1099
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,629
You know, I feel
for your old man.

1100
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:33,602
One son's a champion
with a bum wrist,

1101
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,535
and the other one
is, um, you.

1102
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:37,630
Hey, you come back here again,
and I'm going to show you

1103
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,300
my fists of fury in closeup,
for real.

1104
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:40,900
I don't need
to come back here,

1105
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,502
because after
I win the Golden Cock,

1106
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:45,810
those kids are going to be
begging me to teach them.

1107
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:46,871
You know what?

1108
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:48,349
You can take
your dumb-ass school

1109
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:49,885
and your raggety-ass fliers

1110
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:54,117
and shove them up
your mother ass.

1111
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:55,715
Spoken like a true gentleman.

1112
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:59,023
You know, I fancy a good parade
every now and then,

1113
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:01,656
don't you, Tom?

1114
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:04,860
Plus, I hear Miss Chinatown,
hot this year.

1115
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:16,477
All right, look,
I'll do it,

1116
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:18,036
but you got to train me.

1117
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,483
Michael's Ping-Pong tournament,
I want to play.

1118
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:23,314
Come on, man, don't pretend
like you don't know

1119
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:24,445
what I'm talking about, man.

1120
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:25,920
I heard y'all
talking in the kitchen

1121
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:27,115
about how
you want me to play.

1122
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:31,354
I just want you to know
I'm willing to represent.

1123
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:35,653
What?

1124
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,463
The store?

1125
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:45,031
Hold up; you don't think
I got the chops

1126
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:46,769
to hold down the store?

1127
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:50,139
Man, I could work
the cash register, Dad.

1128
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,237
I'm not an idiot.

1129
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:53,339
Don't worry.
We'll manage.

1130
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:55,715
Yeah, how?

1131
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:57,276
I mean,
no one in our family plays.

1132
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:58,343
No one represents.

1133
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:00,117
Mom don't get students.

1134
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:01,122
You don't get sales.

1135
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:03,182
But you don't need my help.

1136
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,421
Fine.

1137
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:06,860
Man, I can't remember
the last time

1138
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,192
I came up with an idea

1139
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:10,756
and you said,
"Good idea, Chris. "

1140
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:12,131
Hey, remember that time

1141
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:14,397
<i>you connect the TV
and the massage chair</i>

1142
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:16,439
with the remote control?

1143
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:17,939
That was pretty good.

1144
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:19,373
Man, whatever.
Forget it.

1145
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:20,740
I'll train myself.

1146
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:42,658
Yeah.

1147
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:52,735
Why did you have
to cancel class?

1148
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:54,333
Sorry, grasshoppers.

1149
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:56,242
I can't be honing my skills
at the same time

1150
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:57,678
I'm teaching y'all
Ping-Pong 101.

1151
00:51:57,747 --> 00:51:59,009
So? We'll watch you.

1152
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:00,208
No can do.

1153
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,944
Then we'll help you.

1154
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:03,679
<i>No disciple
would abandon his sifu.</i>

1155
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:05,482
Look, that's all good,
Prabakar,

1156
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:07,682
<i>but this calls for ninja mode,
not sifu mode.</i>

1157
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,452
I got to work on my drills,
skills, and kills.

1158
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:11,926
See, I can't be stopping
to take attendance.

1159
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:13,587
Why not?
Why can't we run with?

1160
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:15,756
Dude, calm down.
You'll survive.

1161
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:16,764
No, we won't.

1162
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,164
<i>If you cancel classes,</i>

1163
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:21,033
my mom will make me
take calligraphy.

1164
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:23,265
My parents will put me
in S.A.T. Prep.

1165
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,329
<i>S.A.T. Prep?</i>

1166
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:25,874
You in, what,
like sixth grade?

1167
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:27,671
Fourth.

1168
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:29,211
For me,
language lab.

1169
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:30,473
Brush painting.

1170
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:31,639
Origami.

1171
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:33,114
Folk dance.

1172
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:34,115
Music theory.

1173
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:35,344
Flower arranging.

1174
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:36,817
- Computer camp.
- Test camp.

1175
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:38,218
- Mental math.
- Abacus.

1176
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:43,087
- Boys' choir.
- Boys' choir.

1177
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:49,832
All right, fine.
Let's roll.

1178
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:11,708
What happens if you get stuck
with this loan

1179
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:13,112
for more than one year?

1180
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,014
This is
an adjustable rate mortgage.

1181
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:33,293
<i>I have a friend
at City Federal...</i>

1182
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:35,031
<i>I think it's actually
a little bit better.</i>

1183
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:09,698
Okay, game over,
grasshoppers.

1184
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:23,981
I already played
a bunch of people.

1185
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:25,043
It works.

1186
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,720
Hey, a point
is a point.

1187
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:41,863
Don't worry about it.
I'll manage.

1188
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:45,563
I'll work it out.

1189
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:48,907
Why not now?

1190
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:51,640
Christopher,
I'm going to train you.

1191
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:53,444
Really?

1192
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,608
What about the store?

1193
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,675
Mom can handle it.

1194
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:01,857
Deal?

1195
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:03,187
All right,
but as part of the deal,

1196
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:04,590
I don't want
to hear no complaining

1197
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:05,719
from you or mom either.

1198
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,285
I mean, you know,
nothing about the job,

1199
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,524
you know,
still living at home,

1200
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:10,065
where's his girlfriend,
none of that.

1201
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:12,124
- Come on, man.
- No way.

1202
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,567
All right,
all right, all right.

1203
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:19,671
Swing it, baby.

1204
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:21,734
Let me take you higher,
swing it.

1205
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:23,540
I got
that good foot moving.

1206
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,080
Just gotta love
the way I swing.

1207
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:27,082
Girl, move, don't stop;
keep moving.

1208
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,845
Let me teach you
how to swing.

1209
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:30,545
Hey, I got
that good foot moving.

1210
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,212
Just gotta love
the way I swing.

1211
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:34,256
Girl, move, don't stop;
keep moving.

1212
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:35,689
Here we go.

1213
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:36,919
Hey, here we go.

1214
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:38,085
Let's move.

1215
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:39,753
Here's a kid
who learned to swing.

1216
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:41,353
Getting love
when trouble swings.

1217
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:42,864
Got you in the mood,
I'm like red wine.

1218
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:44,797
Swing, baby, swing,
'cause tonight you're mine.

1219
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:46,495
Let me make your whole world
start to spin.

1220
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,366
You're spending the night
with an African.

1221
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:49,871
I'm on the good foot
as long as I can.

1222
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:51,600
Swing, baby, swing,
let's swing, let's go.

1223
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:57,011
Have fun,
We're done, done, done.

1224
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,104
Now stop.

1225
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:06,622
Let me teach you
how to swing.

1226
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:08,281
Hey, I got
that good foot moving.

1227
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:10,326
Just gotta love
the way I swing.

1228
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:11,860
Girl, move, don't stop;
keep moving.

1229
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,555
Let me teach you
how to swing.

1230
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,564
Hey, I got
that good foot moving.

1231
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:17,259
Just gotta love
the way I swing.

1232
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:18,994
Girl, move, don't stop;
keep moving.

1233
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:21,059
Come on,
teach me how to swing.

1234
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:22,536
I got my body moving.

1235
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,300
Just gotta love
the way I move.

1236
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:26,103
Boy, move, don't stop;
keep swinging.

1237
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:27,871
Come on,
teach me how to swing.

1238
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,844
I got
your body moving.

1239
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:31,437
Just gotta love
the way I move.

1240
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:33,345
Boy, move, don't stop;
keep swinging.

1241
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:36,885
Swing, baby, swing.

1242
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,751
Oh, tell 'em.

1243
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,486
I'm still not clear

1244
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,256
on the reason you chose
Ping-Pong over basketball.

1245
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:47,626
Wait, look, look, look.

1246
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:50,564
I didn't choose Ping-Pong
over nothing, all right?

1247
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,931
Okay, well, it just seems
like an odd decision.

1248
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:54,526
What is that
supposed to mean?

1249
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:56,333
Well, I mean,
we've been talking,

1250
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:58,636
and it seems like you're
trying to buck the stereotype

1251
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:02,769
of the Asian community,
yet Ping-Pong seems...

1252
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:06,441
Wait, like, I can't get in touch
with my roots and stuff?

1253
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:08,484
My family owns
a Ping-Pong store, you know?

1254
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:09,813
I mean, what do you even know

1255
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:13,083
about the Asian or the Chinese
experience anyway, man?

1256
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,420
I mean, what's the last time
you even had Chinese food, man?

1257
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,517
As a matter of fact,
I had some last night.

1258
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:18,561
It was B.S. Chang's.

1259
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:19,595
It was a delightful meal.

1260
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,152
B.S. Chang's?

1261
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:24,632
Dog, B.S. Chang's is about as
Chinese as Charlie Chan, man.

1262
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:26,862
B.S. Chang's
ain't no real Chinese.

1263
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:30,736
Charlie Chan
isn't Chinese?

1264
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:32,240
Is that true?

1265
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:35,937
You a dumb-ass mother,
you know that?

1266
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,223
Man, I'm getting it in,
ain't I?

1267
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:03,566
<i>Sifu, do we have to drill again
after wind sprints?</i>

1268
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:08,168
Yo, I'm training
just like y'all, man.

1269
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:09,677
Come on, little homies,
what's up?

1270
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:12,180
- Ping-Pong's not fun anymore.
- Yeah.

1271
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:13,340
Well, y'all ain't coming here
to have fun.

1272
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:14,576
You're here to learn.

1273
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:16,243
Well, I'm tired
of learning.

1274
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,583
Can't we still, like,
play games or something?

1275
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:43,843
Pull a little something.
This is how we does.

1276
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,938
Follow step, step,
but you catch a buzz.

1277
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:47,209
At the back of the pool,

1278
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:48,716
we be jigging
till we nauseous.

1279
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:51,618
Acting a dance fool
like no one's really watching.

1280
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:22,546
Do that, do that,
do that, do that, do that.

1281
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,917
Nine to five,
overdrive.

1282
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:27,479
Do that, do that,
do that, do that, do it.

1283
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:29,680
Dance.

1284
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:32,023
Do that, do that,
do that, do it.

1285
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:45,967
I know, man,
I know.

1286
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:50,540
Come on, dog, man,
it's just...

1287
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:51,841
Dog?

1288
01:00:58,388 --> 01:00:59,412
It's just an expression...

1289
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:02,615
Come on,
I'll practice an extra hour now.

1290
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:05,991
Okay, just serves, okay?

1291
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:11,666
Dad!

1292
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:19,066
You didn't
bring him back on...

1293
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:21,133
Where's the bike?
Hit a fire hydrant?

1294
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,199
Very funny.

1295
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:26,044
You know, it did
make you look taller.

1296
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:27,639
I went to the mall
after class.

1297
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:31,551
Thanks, like he's not spoiled
enough at home already.

1298
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:32,986
Later.

1299
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:36,025
Hey, what happened
to Mr. Smack?

1300
01:01:36,092 --> 01:01:37,889
Just ain't in the mood.

1301
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,758
Mmm.

1302
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:41,956
Stressed out, huh?

1303
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,293
Stuff with your brother,
right,

1304
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:44,924
taking his place
in the tournament?

1305
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:46,468
How you know about that?

1306
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,766
My brother talks about you
all the time.

1307
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:51,068
It's not like I'm even trying
to win this thing for myself.

1308
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,368
I'm doing it
for my family, man.

1309
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:54,103
Ain't doing it so I can get
no stupid parade

1310
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:56,737
and ride around with
Miss Chinatown and.

1311
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:58,405
God, I hate that
Miss Chinatown.

1312
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,449
Yeah.
Yeah.

1313
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:04,008
It just perpetuates the whole
idea of the exotic Asian women.

1314
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:05,987
I mean, half the people
that go see Miss Chinatown

1315
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,352
aren't even Chinese.

1316
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:09,391
Yeah, I feel you on that.
I feel you.

1317
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:11,552
You know, a lot of those girls
don't even speak Chinese.

1318
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:12,753
Serious?

1319
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:14,421
That's what
my whole dissertation is on,

1320
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:16,897
the objectification and
exoticizing of Chinese women.

1321
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:18,433
Oh, that's tight.

1322
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:19,968
So you in college, then?

1323
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:21,162
Grad school.

1324
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,831
Asian-American studies.

1325
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:25,032
Cool.

1326
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:29,573
Anyway, I got to go make Felix
ingest some protein.

1327
01:02:29,645 --> 01:02:30,907
Thanks for bringing him back.

1328
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:31,969
No worries.

1329
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:38,109
Oh, are you going to
the tournament next weekend?

1330
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:39,984
Um, dissertation.

1331
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:47,429
But maybe I'll try to make...
stop by.

1332
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:12,384
What?

1333
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:22,793
Christopher.

1334
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:35,833
Oh, hell no.

1335
01:03:39,682 --> 01:03:40,944
All right, look, man,
hey, I said

1336
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:42,450
I was going to play
in the tournament,

1337
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:44,281
but I didn't agree to wear
no damn Daisy Dukes.

1338
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:45,411
Daisy what?

1339
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:46,921
Man, why I got
to wear those?

1340
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,150
This is standard
Ping-Pong clothes.

1341
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:50,658
All competitors
wear these.

1342
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:52,353
Man, Michael
didn't have to wear these.

1343
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,362
Son of a.

1344
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:19,286
It's Cheryl,
not Shee-lo,

1345
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,880
Cheryl Davis,
regional administrator.

1346
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:24,017
Regional administ...

1347
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:26,493
You can just say
I'm the boss.

1348
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:27,722
You understand boss,
right?

1349
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:29,822
Boss?
Right?

1350
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:30,923
You know,
"You're fired!"

1351
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,399
Boss.

1352
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:08,971
Hey, man,
make sure your sister

1353
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:10,869
don't see me in these
tight-ass shorts, man.

1354
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:12,931
And I don't mean like
tight-tight, you hear me?

1355
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:14,203
Word.

1356
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:15,574
Look.

1357
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:16,737
That's tight, man.

1358
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:18,211
My ninjas.

1359
01:05:22,818 --> 01:05:26,219
- Dog...
- Not one word.

1360
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:27,517
What are you
doing here anyway?

1361
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,182
You going to tell me
my Ping-Pong stinks?

1362
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:30,782
Now, come on, man.

1363
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,760
I came here
'cause I got your back.

1364
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:39,297
<i>Round one
will begin in five minutes.</i>

1365
01:05:39,368 --> 01:05:42,895
<i>Competitors, please report
to your tables.</i>

1366
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:46,533
All right, man,
let's do this thing.

1367
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:52,771
Aw, yeah,
what's up?

1368
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:12,959
Whistling here,
whistling there.

1369
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:14,832
Whistling
almost everywhere.

1370
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:16,599
Whistling up,
whistling down.

1371
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:18,765
Whistling while
I turn around.

1372
01:06:18,841 --> 01:06:20,331
Whistling here,
whistling there.

1373
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:22,001
Whistling
almost everywhere.

1374
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:24,273
Whistling up,
whistling down.

1375
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:25,974
Whistling
while I turn around.

1376
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:53,440
I can't believe it.

1377
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:55,807
One mother match,
and it's already over.

1378
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:57,175
Prince Charles
is going to win.

1379
01:06:57,246 --> 01:06:58,474
Maybe I'll see you later?

1380
01:06:58,547 --> 01:06:59,878
What's that
supposed to mean, man?

1381
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:01,416
Like you're trying
to kick me while I'm down?

1382
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:03,281
Like you think that just
'cause you win one stupid game

1383
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:05,217
that you're like my master
and commander or something?

1384
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:06,754
<i>No, no, that's not
what I meant.</i>

1385
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:08,380
<i>You think that
just 'cause I'm Chinese</i>

1386
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:10,152
<i>that I'm going to be a passive,
non-aggressive mother?</i>

1387
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:11,215
Hey, hold me back, man,
hold me back.

1388
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:12,624
Please, I just meant that maybe

1389
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:14,219
I'll see you later
in the elimination round, man.

1390
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:15,263
Come again?

1391
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:16,730
The first half of the day, man,

1392
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:17,993
round robin, man,
round robin.

1393
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:20,001
- You mean I'm still in?
- Yes.

1394
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:23,402
Dog, why didn't you
just say so?

1395
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,878
Whistling here,
whistling there.

1396
01:07:39,955 --> 01:07:41,889
Whistling
almost everywhere.

1397
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:43,720
Whistling up,
whistling down.

1398
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:45,693
Whistling while
I turn around.

1399
01:07:45,761 --> 01:07:47,388
Whistling here,
whistling there.

1400
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:49,431
Whistling
almost everywhere.

1401
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:51,022
Whistling up,
whistling down.

1402
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,364
Whistling while
I turn around.

1403
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:02,972
<i>First elimination
begins in ten minutes.</i>

1404
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:04,706
<i>All scorers report
to officials' table.</i>

1405
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:53,985
You can't expect him
to change overnight, Ma.

1406
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:56,531
<i>The good thing is, he's finally
following through for once.</i>

1407
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:58,191
Hey, that was...
that was in, man.

1408
01:08:58,267 --> 01:08:59,996
<i>Hey, it glanced off
the side of the table, man.</i>

1409
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:01,297
<i>Did you see it
change angle, man?</i>

1410
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:02,769
<i>Dude, it glanced
off the table, man.</i>

1411
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:04,362
<i>Did you see it?
It changed angle, man.</i>

1412
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,805
Didn't you see it?

1413
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:06,842
Give me that.

1414
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:08,171
Come on, Chris.

1415
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:09,506
Go back and change
the score, man.

1416
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:10,602
That was a deuce.

1417
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:12,146
We can play that again.
That's a deuce.

1418
01:09:12,214 --> 01:09:13,511
<i>Hey, what are you doing, man?</i>

1419
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:15,174
<i>What are you doing,
going back to your chair, man?</i>

1420
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:23,151
Ya!

1421
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:24,852
Man, that last game
was bull, man.

1422
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:27,452
That mother ref
is blind as a mother...

1423
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:31,858
How would you know, man?

1424
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:33,424
You don't even go
to any of my games, man.

1425
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:34,469
Middle school, JV...

1426
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:36,528
You're too old
to remember.

1427
01:09:36,605 --> 01:09:37,799
I'm talking
about Ping-Pong.

1428
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:01,152
Man, what are you
ragging on me for, man?

1429
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:02,595
I'm doing this
for you and Mom, man.

1430
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:03,757
I don't even
want to be here.

1431
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:10,294
Actually had
some lucky draws.

1432
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:11,924
That last guy
was a...

1433
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:30,507
You feel me?

1434
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:34,783
That's tight.

1435
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:36,688
I like that.

1436
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:40,793
It's very nice.

1437
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:52,472
We're coming correct,
you got to be hectic.

1438
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:54,702
The people are jumping 'cause
they're feeling electric.

1439
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:56,335
But give me a second
to reject the strike.

1440
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:58,573
Respect the rock beat, people,
I'm the psycho.

1441
01:11:58,647 --> 01:11:59,978
Zap the bottle,
twist the cap,

1442
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:01,311
tip the bottle back,
and relax,

1443
01:12:01,383 --> 01:12:02,714
as you get whack,
it's just a fact.

1444
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:03,979
Nobody does it
better than us,

1445
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:05,077
and we get so stupid

1446
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:06,416
that we got
to ride the short bus.

1447
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:08,319
Who rock the party?
We rock the party.

1448
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:10,654
Never gonna,
never gonna give up now.

1449
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:32,035
Uh!

1450
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:49,654
Who wants to party?
We want to party.

1451
01:12:49,732 --> 01:12:51,597
'Cause tonight
the party don't stop.

1452
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:53,294
Who wants to party?
We want to party.

1453
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,836
'Cause tonight
the party don't stop.

1454
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:57,303
Take that one
back to your master.

1455
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:04,035
Ah!

1456
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:05,205
Booyah!

1457
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,304
You're next!

1458
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:07,576
We want to party.

1459
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:09,048
'Cause tonight
the party don't stop.

1460
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:10,915
Who wants to party?
We want to party.

1461
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:13,147
I got it going on.
A- give me what you got.

1462
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,951
Who wants to party?
We want to party.

1463
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:16,650
'Cause tonight
the party don't stop.

1464
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:18,920
Who wants to party?
We want to party.

1465
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:20,689
Never gonna,
never gonna...

1466
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:26,533
You got this.

1467
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:28,297
These goddamn shorts, man.

1468
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:29,803
<i>Sifu.</i>

1469
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:32,363
What's up, little Gs?
Where you been at?

1470
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:33,840
I've taken the liberty

1471
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:36,275
of outfitting
the shoes you threw away.

1472
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:37,869
I've modified them to include

1473
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:39,743
a hybrid rubber molding
on the side

1474
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:43,307
as well as helium pockets
designed specifically to enhance

1475
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:45,512
your jump-smashing style
of play.

1476
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:48,317
P.B. Rizzle,
my own shoes.

1477
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:49,550
My own nickname.

1478
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:51,217
I mean, can I wear
these, though?

1479
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:52,817
I mean, is it,
like, regulation shoes?

1480
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,328
Regulation?

1481
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:56,227
You know, like
the shorts and stuff.

1482
01:13:56,298 --> 01:13:59,392
According to the American
Table Tennis Federation,

1483
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:00,958
there is no standard uniform.

1484
01:14:01,036 --> 01:14:03,061
Are you kidding me?

1485
01:14:03,138 --> 01:14:05,606
You mean all these fools
wear this by choice?

1486
01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:07,164
Son of a...

1487

<i>Christopher Wang,</i>

1488

<i>Christopher Wang.</i>

1490
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:51,050
Hey!

1491
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:56,322
I got this.
I got this, man.

1492
01:14:56,391 --> 01:14:57,517
I was listening
to you, man.

1493
01:14:57,593 --> 01:14:59,618
No matter what happens,
Ping-Pong is like life.

1494
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:01,219
It's not the quick sprint
that matters.

1495
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:03,662
It's...

1496
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:05,063
Just kick his ass.

1497
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:10,896
Booyah.

1498
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:13,168
Booyah.

1499
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,342
I got this feeling, man.

1500
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:26,512
I got it,
I got it.

1501
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:28,021
You'll never understand.

1502
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:29,421
You know, uh,
you know, uh,

1503
01:15:29,491 --> 01:15:32,221
you know the place to be...
on top, on top,

1504
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:33,625
right next to Booker T.

1505
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:35,560
Let's play,
ha-ha.

1506
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:49,306
Welcome, everyone,
to the championship match

1507
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:52,575
of the Golden Cock
Ping-Pong Championship.

1508
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:57,110
<i>You know,
people ask me,</i>

1509
01:15:57,185 --> 01:16:01,144
"Cheryl, how does a girl from
Iowa end up directing an event

1510
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:04,192
sponsored by
the Chinese Community Center?"

1511
01:16:04,259 --> 01:16:06,124
And I just say to them,

1512
01:16:06,194 --> 01:16:08,059
"Me love a-Ping-Pong
long time. "

1513
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:18,535
So our first competitor,
representing

1514
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:21,872
the new Harcourt International
Institute of Table Tennis

1515
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:23,468
of West Covina,

1516

Gerald Harcourt.

1517
01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:33,453
<i>And his challenger,
challenging for the title,</i>

1518
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:35,547
<i>representing
Ping-Pong Palace,</i>

1519
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:37,888
Christopher Wang.

1520
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:43,290
Excuse me.

1521
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:46,232
Christopher "C-Dub" Wang.

1522
01:16:55,377 --> 01:16:56,469
Three games
for the match.

1523
01:16:56,545 --> 01:16:58,809
The first to 11 wins.

1524
01:16:58,880 --> 01:16:59,847
Good luck,
gentlemen.

1525

<i>Christopher Wang to serve.</i>

Oh.

1527
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:25,332
C- Dub, come on, you can do
better than that, baby.

1528
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:47,120
<i>Downtown to Chinatown, uh!</i>

1529
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:48,719
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you get a point?

1530
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:50,594
<i>So fast, you missed it.</i>

1531
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:57,271
<i>Son of a...</i>

1532
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,157
<i>Game one
to Gerald Harcourt.</i>

1533
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:24,960
<i>Harcourt leads
one to zero.</i>

1534
01:18:35,343 --> 01:18:36,970
Gerald Harcourt to serve.

1535
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:50,451
Ha-ha, who wants to play
some whack-a-fool?

1536
01:18:50,525 --> 01:18:52,220
<i>That all you got,
weak nut?</i>

1537
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:01,325
Ah!
Like that?

1538
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:02,563
<i>Yeah, baby.</i>

1539
01:19:02,637 --> 01:19:06,164
Make some noise,
make noise.

1540
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:08,505
Aw, yeah, yeah. Come on.

1541
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,169
<i>Where my peoples at?</i>

1542
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:18,948
P.B. Rizzle!

1543
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:21,079
<i>No mercy.</i>

1544
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:22,088
That's my son.

1545
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:23,590
He also plays piano.

1546
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:26,320
Rachmaninoff, no problem.

1547
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:29,557
Better bow down
to the new master.

1548
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:30,620
Ah!

1549
01:19:38,507 --> 01:19:42,466
Make some noise,
make noise.

1550
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:44,307
Go.

1551
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:47,075
<i>Thing of beauty.
So pretty.</i>

1552
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:49,481
That's all you, baby.

1553
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:52,111
Game point, Wang.

1554
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:09,333
<i>What time is it?</i>

1555
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:11,372
<i>Game time!</i>

1556
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:14,237
<i>Game 2
to Christopher Wang.</i>

1557
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:16,800
<i>Game tied
1 to 1.</i>

1558
01:20:16,878 --> 01:20:17,845
Lost your collar, dog?

1559
01:20:17,913 --> 01:20:18,937
If you're
looking for your owner,

1560
01:20:19,014 --> 01:20:19,981
he's standing right here.

1561
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:20,980
Tom, what do you do

1562
01:20:21,049 --> 01:20:22,880
with a dog
that barks too much?

1563
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:24,509
P- T-S.

1564
01:20:24,586 --> 01:20:26,213
Oh, that's right, you're
putting everyone to sleep.

1565
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:27,915
It's his best weapon,
you know.

1566
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:29,479
Chinese chatter torture.

1567
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:37,798
<i>Christopher Wang
to serve.</i>

1568
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:39,163
I hope you're hungry,
'cause I'm getting ready

1569
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:40,292
to serve you
some Chinese take-out.

1570
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:48,505
Oh, who's smoking the opium now,
Sir Chokes-a-Lot?

1571
01:20:48,577 --> 01:20:50,807
<i>Stuff that in your knickers,
blue boy.</i>

1572
01:20:50,879 --> 01:20:53,074
Miss Davis, many, many rules

1573
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:55,207
have been flaunted
during this match:

1574
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:57,274
The showboating,
the profanity.

1575
01:20:57,352 --> 01:20:59,718
But this
I simply cannot let slide.

1576
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:02,586
Under section 4-F
of the ATTF rulebook,

1577
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:05,023
it clearly states
that unsportsmanlike conduct

1578
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:06,185
<i>may be defined as.:</i>

1579
01:21:06,261 --> 01:21:07,990
"Baiting, tounting"...

1580
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:09,587
Taunting.

1581
01:21:09,664 --> 01:21:10,824
There's a U.

1582
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:13,367
"Baiting, taunting,
or any other act

1583
01:21:13,435 --> 01:21:15,869
"designed to embarrass,
ridicule, or demean others

1584
01:21:15,937 --> 01:21:18,701
on the basis of race, gender,
or national origin. "

1585
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:20,070
You got to be kidding me.

1586
01:21:20,141 --> 01:21:22,473
Furthermore, it states
that players who exhibit

1587
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:23,943
unsportsmanlike conduct
may face ejection.

1588
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:25,309
Hold up,
you calling me a racist?

1589
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:26,779
Gentlemen.
Gentlemen.

1590
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:28,475
I will not be a pawn
in this forum

1591
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,279
with these attacks
on my national heritage.

1592
01:21:30,352 --> 01:21:32,252
Dude, you're from,
like, Encino.

1593
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,787
I demand his ejection.

1594
01:21:33,855 --> 01:21:35,686
Looking for
the easy way out, huh?

1595
01:21:35,757 --> 01:21:36,849
You're one to talk.

1596
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:38,187
Someone get a cup
of shut-up juice

1597
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,284
for this mama-jama.

1598
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:40,953
Mr. Wang,
please do not speak Chinese.

1599
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:45,227
<i>The official language
of the ATTF is American.</i>

1600
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,790
The committee
will discuss this.

1601
01:21:46,868 --> 01:21:48,267
Please step away.

1602
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:09,980
<i>The committee has ruled
on Mr. Wang's violation</i>

1603
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:11,992
of ATTF section 4.

1604
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,051
<i>Because this is
a first infraction,</i>

1605
01:22:14,129 --> 01:22:19,032
Mr. Wang
will not be ejected.

1606
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:22,297
<i>However, he will be required
to refrain</i>

1607
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:24,463
from all verbal ejaculations

1608
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:26,439
for the remainder
of the tournament.

1609
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:27,907
Verbal what?

1610
01:22:27,976 --> 01:22:30,968
What it means, old chum, is,
you can't talk.

1611
01:22:31,046 --> 01:22:33,173
Hold up, you know, I got
a right to free speech,

1612
01:22:33,248 --> 01:22:34,943
<i>especially when the subject
of that speech</i>

1613
01:22:35,016 --> 01:22:37,712
is a student-poaching,
female-harassing,

1614
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:41,085
SPF-50-wearing,
Grey-Poupon-smearing mother...

1615
01:22:41,156 --> 01:22:45,183
Sir, you are one word away
from disqualification.

1616
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:46,488
One.

1617
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:51,359
Was th...

1618
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:52,559
Was there something you...

1619
01:22:54,669 --> 01:22:55,863
He can't talk.

1620
01:23:06,715 --> 01:23:07,875
Back on my feet.

1621
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:09,439
My game is,
my aim is

1622
01:23:09,517 --> 01:23:11,451
to get those
that's painless, not brainless.

1623
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:12,508
Say something mean.

1624
01:23:12,587 --> 01:23:13,849
I know you want
to lash out.

1625
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:16,254
Another reason I know
that I got to get out.

1626
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:18,019
It's over.

1627
01:23:18,093 --> 01:23:19,993
Yes, this is the end.

1628
01:23:20,061 --> 01:23:22,256
We don't need
to be friends.

1629
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:25,163
So once you get to know me.

1630
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:27,098
Yes, it's over.

1631
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:28,897
Yes, this is the end.

1632
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:29,994
Yes, it's...

1633
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:31,163
We don't need
to be friends.

1634
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:32,297
Lights out.

1635
01:23:32,374 --> 01:23:33,534
So why don't you
get to walking?

1636
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:36,634
It's on now.

1637
01:23:36,711 --> 01:23:38,804
You know,
you're really unbelievable.

1638
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,575
I mean,

1639
01:23:40,648 --> 01:23:42,275
you cheating me
in things,

1640
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:44,045
but I wasn't going to say
nothing about this.

1641
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,010
Serve the ball.

1642
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:56,390
You guys are being crazy.

1643
01:23:56,464 --> 01:24:00,093
Yes, this is the end.

1644
01:24:00,168 --> 01:24:01,294
Lights out.

1645
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:03,098
We don't need
to be friends.

1646
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:06,140
So why don't you
get to walking?

1647
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:08,107
Yes, it's over.

1648
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:09,734
Yes, this is the end.

1649
01:24:09,811 --> 01:24:12,678
We don't need
to be friends.

1650
01:24:12,747 --> 01:24:14,305
So why don't you
get to walking?

1651
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:16,942
It's over now, uh.

1652
01:24:31,332 --> 01:24:33,960
<i>Injury time-out,
five minutes,</i>

1653
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:36,162
<i>pending medical review.</i>

1654
01:24:39,774 --> 01:24:41,469
Shake it off, C-Dub.

1655
01:24:41,543 --> 01:24:43,477
You know,
he wouldn't have fallen

1656
01:24:43,545 --> 01:24:45,570
<i>if his footwork was just
a little bit neater.</i>

1657
01:24:45,647 --> 01:24:46,739
He was airborne.

1658
01:24:46,815 --> 01:24:48,442
I don't think footwork
was the issue.

1659
01:24:48,516 --> 01:24:50,450
You'd be surprised.

1660
01:24:50,518 --> 01:24:52,110
You're the brother,
aren't you?

1661
01:24:52,187 --> 01:24:54,052
That's me.
Do you play?

1662
01:24:54,122 --> 01:24:55,089
No.

1663
01:24:55,156 --> 01:24:56,680
Would you like to learn?

1664
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:58,385
Why does every guy I meet
want to teach me Ping-Pong?

1665
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,223
I hate to break it to you,

1666
01:25:00,295 --> 01:25:02,354
but it's not exactly
a chick-magnet sport.

1667
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,830
Well, it's like that in America,
but you know what?

1668
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:08,926
In China, they would treat me
like Michael Jordan.

1669
01:25:09,003 --> 01:25:10,163
Excuse me.

1670
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:16,903
What happened
to the posse?

1671
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:18,309
I'm too nervous.

1672
01:25:18,379 --> 01:25:20,074
I feel like
I want to throw up.

1673
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:21,342
Suck it up.

1674
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:23,008
C- Dub's out there
sweating and bleeding.

1675
01:25:23,084 --> 01:25:24,381
Worse,
he can't talk,

1676
01:25:24,452 --> 01:25:26,647
and you guys sit here
like the see-no-evil monkeys?

1677
01:25:26,721 --> 01:25:29,588
Perhaps you could suggest
some cheers?

1678
01:25:29,657 --> 01:25:31,716
Do I look like
a cheerleader to you?

1679
01:25:36,264 --> 01:25:38,095
Boys, let's show them
what you got.

1680
01:26:08,129 --> 01:26:10,791
<i>Mr. Wang is cleared for play.</i>

1681
01:26:10,865 --> 01:26:12,355
<i>The final game
will resume.</i>

1682
01:26:12,433 --> 01:26:14,697
<i>Harcourt leads
9 to 6.</i>

1683
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:55,233
Yes.

1684
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:12,787
<i>The score is tied.</i>

1685
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:14,919
<i>Champion must win
by 2 points.</i>

1686
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:44,158
<i>Match point, Wang.</i>

1687
01:27:44,225 --> 01:27:46,921
Harcourt to serve.

1688
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:35,601
Ah!

1689
01:28:35,677 --> 01:28:37,804
Uh!

1690
01:28:37,879 --> 01:28:39,210
Ah.

1691
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,941
Ah!

1692
01:28:44,085 --> 01:28:47,020
<i>Game and match
to Christopher Wang.</i>

1693
01:28:58,299 --> 01:29:02,326
He was fantastic,
absolutely fantastic.

1694
01:29:02,403 --> 01:29:03,995
That's my son.

1695
01:29:04,072 --> 01:29:06,336
Ah!

1696
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:11,042
Gerald, they're going
to make you pay for that.

1697
01:29:11,112 --> 01:29:12,204
You want some tea?

1698
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:13,907
I got the thermos open.

1699
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:17,276
Yeah!

1700
01:29:23,991 --> 01:29:25,288
Edward, you're late.

1701
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,520
We need a partner
for Mrs. Lu.

1702
01:29:26,594 --> 01:29:28,221
Grab a paddle.

1703
01:29:32,266 --> 01:29:33,255
Oh, you did that.

1704
01:29:33,334 --> 01:29:35,393
Dad, hit it like this.

1705
01:29:48,716 --> 01:29:51,048
Tell your dad the
manufacturing deal's locked up.

1706
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:53,485
All I need from you is to get
those specs for those shoes.

1707
01:29:53,554 --> 01:29:54,885
First thing tomorrow.

1708
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:55,923
Word.

1709
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:56,957
Yo, yo.

1710
01:29:57,024 --> 01:29:58,355
What's up, homey?

1711
01:29:58,426 --> 01:30:00,189
How's it feel to be
off the leash, man?

1712
01:30:00,261 --> 01:30:01,626
Oh, it's all good, playa.

1713
01:30:01,696 --> 01:30:03,755
When you got a big dog
like Rabakar's dad in the yard,

1714
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:04,855
ain't no need to be sweating.

1715
01:30:04,932 --> 01:30:06,263
Hey, heard that.

1716
01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:08,268
Hey, do you want to play
some basketball later?

1717
01:30:08,336 --> 01:30:09,462
We haven't played
in forever.

1718
01:30:09,537 --> 01:30:10,561
Sorry, dog.

1719
01:30:10,638 --> 01:30:12,071
I have to give my moms
a ride home.

1720
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:14,404
But I'll hit you up in the
neighborhood later, all right?

1721
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:15,533
All right.

1722
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:17,475
As long as
your sister's home.

1723
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:33,750
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, Ma.

1724
01:30:33,828 --> 01:30:35,796
One last lesson.

1725
01:30:39,133 --> 01:30:41,761
Always watch your back!

1726
01:31:00,688 --> 01:31:01,882
How you doing?

1727
01:31:01,956 --> 01:31:03,583
Splat!

1728
01:31:11,165 --> 01:31:19,103
I like, I like,
I like cereal.

1729
01:31:19,173 --> 01:31:21,698
Don't put the box away;
I'm about to have me some more.

1730
01:31:21,776 --> 01:31:29,144
I like, I like,
I like cereal.

1731
01:31:29,217 --> 01:31:31,981
Don't put the box away;
I'm about to have me some more.

1732
01:31:32,053 --> 01:31:34,419
Sitting at the table
throwing fits at my mother.

1733
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:35,547
Want my own box.

1734
01:31:35,623 --> 01:31:37,454
I don't want to split
with my brother.

1735
01:31:37,525 --> 01:31:40,085
The one thing I hated
to admit, he discovered.

1736
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:42,629
Certain cereals will make
the milk different colors.

1737
01:31:42,697 --> 01:31:45,131
If you took away my cereal,
you heard screams.

1738
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:47,895
I like Kaboom! 'cause it
always made my poo turn green.

1739
01:31:47,969 --> 01:31:49,163
I make a scene
in the store

1740
01:31:49,237 --> 01:31:50,829
and start
to act disobedient

1741
01:31:50,905 --> 01:31:53,669
if sugar didn't come first
in the ingredients.

1742
01:31:53,741 --> 01:31:56,301
Make my mom buy me some,
no matter what it costed.

1743
01:31:56,377 --> 01:31:58,868
The best ones started
with the same word, "frosted. "

1744
01:31:58,946 --> 01:32:01,141
'Cause if it ain't sugary,
it ain't no good.

1745
01:32:01,215 --> 01:32:02,648
I hate
health food cereals.

1746
01:32:02,717 --> 01:32:04,548
They taste like wood.

1747
01:32:04,619 --> 01:32:07,679
I like, I like,
I like cereal.

1748
01:32:07,755 --> 01:32:09,416
I eat my Wheaties
for breakfast.

1749
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:11,685
No one can mess with
the champ.

1750
01:32:11,759 --> 01:32:13,090
I'm the champ.
Oh, yes.

1751
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:14,320
Today I'm a winner.

1752
01:32:14,395 --> 01:32:15,760
I'll eat you
for dinner.

1753
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:18,128
I'm a champ.
I'm a champ.

1754
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:19,359
God gave me talent.

1755
01:32:19,433 --> 01:32:20,866
I'm a super machine.

1756
01:32:20,935 --> 01:32:23,165
I'm better than the dudes
that I see on TV.

1757
01:32:23,237 --> 01:32:24,397
I'm a champ,
Mama said.

1758
01:32:24,472 --> 01:32:25,632
I'm a champ,
Papa said.

1759
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:26,832
I'm a champ,
you'll see.

1760
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:28,432
I'm a champ,
goddamn.

1761
01:32:28,509 --> 01:32:29,533
I'm rated number one

1762
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:31,077
at the top of the game.

1763
01:32:31,145 --> 01:32:32,112
Hey, the dynasty's begun.

1764
01:32:32,179 --> 01:32:33,373
Ain't no stopping
this reign.

1765
01:32:33,447 --> 01:32:34,505
Better recognize the face,

1766
01:32:34,582 --> 01:32:35,776
start jocking the name.

1767
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:37,044
With my whole line of shoes,

1768
01:32:37,118 --> 01:32:38,346
watch 'em
walkin' the Js.

1769
01:32:38,419 --> 01:32:41,047
Oh, I'm something special,
one of a kind.

1770
01:32:41,122 --> 01:32:42,111
Got my big bowl of Wheaties.

1771
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:43,315
I was born to fly

1772
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:45,882
Yes, I'm extra lifted,
extra gifted.

1773
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,554
I'm going down in history
frozen in time.

1774
01:32:48,629 --> 01:32:49,721
Got trophies
by the dozens

1775
01:32:49,797 --> 01:32:51,059
and medals to count.

1776
01:32:51,132 --> 01:32:53,464
And I'm on your television show
and off my house.

1777
01:32:53,534 --> 01:32:54,728
Everybody wants to see me.

1778
01:32:54,802 --> 01:32:55,928
I'm the talk of the town.

1779
01:32:56,003 --> 01:32:57,265
Just the life
of a champ.

1780
01:32:57,338 --> 01:32:58,464
Take a look
at me now.

1781
01:32:58,539 --> 01:33:00,006
I eat my Wheaties
for breakfast.

1782
01:33:00,074 --> 01:33:02,474
No one can mess with
the champ.

1783
01:33:02,543 --> 01:33:03,874
I'm a champ.
Oh, yes.

1784
01:33:03,945 --> 01:33:04,912
Today I'm a winner.

1785
01:33:04,979 --> 01:33:06,139
I'll eat you
for dinner.

1786
01:33:06,213 --> 01:33:08,909
I'm a champ.
I'm a champ.

1787
01:33:08,983 --> 01:33:10,109
God gave me talent.

1788
01:33:10,184 --> 01:33:11,651
I'm a super machine.

1789
01:33:11,719 --> 01:33:13,949
I'm better than the dudes
that I see on TV.

1790
01:33:14,021 --> 01:33:15,181
I'm a champ,
Mama said.

1791
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:16,416
I'm a champ,
Papa said.

1792
01:33:16,490 --> 01:33:17,616
I'm a champ,
you'll see.

1793
01:33:17,692 --> 01:33:18,852
I'm a champ,
goddamn.

1794
01:33:18,926 --> 01:33:20,223
I feel great
in the morning

1795
01:33:20,294 --> 01:33:21,454
when I wake up.

1796
01:33:21,529 --> 01:33:23,394
I'm a man on a mission
with no makeup.

1797
01:33:23,464 --> 01:33:26,592
I got lots to do today,
like find the right girl,

1798
01:33:26,667 --> 01:33:28,862
get my oil changed,
and take over the world.

1799
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:31,803
See, everything you do,
I bet I could do it better.

1800
01:33:31,872 --> 01:33:34,136
If you climb a hill,
I'll climb the Staples Center.

1801
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:36,540
If you say "what,"
then I'ma say "whatever. "

1802
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:37,771
And if you
got the cheese,

1803
01:33:37,845 --> 01:33:39,073
then I'ma bring it better.

1804
01:33:39,146 --> 01:33:41,205
See, I don't even stop
at a stop sign.

1805
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:44,080
With a off rhyme,
I can still sound dope on time.

1806
01:33:44,151 --> 01:33:46,551
I can sound proper.
I can sound unsigned.

1807
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:48,953
Don't step to your man.
He's a land mine.

1808
01:33:49,023 --> 01:33:50,718
I eat my Wheaties
for breakfast.

1809
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:52,952
No one can mess with
the champ.

1810
01:33:53,027 --> 01:33:54,358
I'm a champ.
Oh, yes.

1811
01:33:54,428 --> 01:33:55,395
Today I'm a winner.

1812
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:56,657
I'll eat you
for dinner.

1813
01:33:56,731 --> 01:33:59,393
I'm a champ.
I'm a champ.

1814
01:33:59,467 --> 01:34:00,627
God gave me talent.

1815
01:34:00,701 --> 01:34:02,032
I'm a super machine.

1816
01:34:02,103 --> 01:34:04,435
I'm better than the dudes
that I see on TV.

1817
01:34:04,505 --> 01:34:05,665
I'm a champ,
Mama said.

1818
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:06,900
I'm a champ,
Papa said.

1819
01:34:06,974 --> 01:34:07,963
I'm a champ,
you'll see.

1820
01:34:08,042 --> 01:34:09,304
I'm a champ,
goddamn.

1821
01:34:09,377 --> 01:34:12,005
Too short to be a baller, nope,
let alone a starter.

1822
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:13,011
Warming up the bench,

1823
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:14,604
I got it hotter
than a sauna.

1824
01:34:14,682 --> 01:34:17,150
Never getting called 'cause
I was skinny like my mama.

1825
01:34:17,218 --> 01:34:19,686
Couldn't land a chick
because my daddy sang opera.

1826
01:34:19,754 --> 01:34:21,984
Had a lot of time to think
stuffed inside my locker.

1827
01:34:22,056 --> 01:34:23,182
Penny for my thoughts,

1828
01:34:23,257 --> 01:34:24,724
then I'd have
a million dollars.

1829
01:34:24,792 --> 01:34:27,317
Didn't like to read,
so I couldn't be a scholar.

1830
01:34:27,395 --> 01:34:29,590
Didn't like the coppers.
Think a little harder.

1831
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:31,859
Put it all together,
and what did I see?

1832
01:34:31,932 --> 01:34:33,058
What?
What could I be?

1833
01:34:33,134 --> 01:34:34,567
I could be an MC.

1834
01:34:34,635 --> 01:34:35,761
I ain't making money trees.

1835
01:34:35,836 --> 01:34:37,064
I'm just planting
my seeds.

1836
01:34:37,138 --> 01:34:38,298
But I'm doing what I feel,

1837
01:34:38,372 --> 01:34:39,532
and that's
a winner to me.

1838
01:34:39,607 --> 01:34:41,040
I eat my Wheaties
for breakfast.

1839
01:34:41,108 --> 01:34:43,201
No one can mess with
the champ.

1840
01:34:43,277 --> 01:34:44,938
I'm a champ.
Oh, yes.

1841
01:34:45,012 --> 01:34:45,979
Today I'm a winner.

1842
01:34:46,047 --> 01:34:47,241
I'll eat you
for dinner.

1843
01:34:47,314 --> 01:34:49,976
I'm a champ.
I'm a champ.

1844
01:34:50,051 --> 01:34:51,211
God gave me talent.

1845
01:34:51,285 --> 01:34:52,513
I'm a super machine.

1846
01:34:52,586 --> 01:34:54,486
I'm better than the dudes
that I see on TV.

1847
01:34:54,555 --> 01:34:55,852
I'm a champ,
Mama said.

1848
01:34:55,923 --> 01:34:57,151
I'm a champ,
Papa said.

1849
01:34:57,224 --> 01:34:58,384
I'm a champ,
you'll see.

1850
01:34:58,459 --> 01:35:00,324
I'm a champ,
goddamn.

1851
01:35:16,844 --> 01:35:18,778
Hi, I'm Gerald Harcourt

1852
01:35:18,846 --> 01:35:22,748
of the Harcourt Institute
of Table Tennis of Canoga Park.

1853
01:35:22,817 --> 01:35:27,311
And, um, we're here to make
learning table tennis a smash.

1854
01:35:30,124 --> 01:35:35,460
We've got four hands
to perfect your forehands.

1855
01:35:35,529 --> 01:35:40,899
And you'll come back
to learn the backhand.

1856
01:35:40,968 --> 01:35:42,060
Table tennis:

1857
01:35:42,136 --> 01:35:47,233
Truly a sport of kings
and queens.

1858
01:35:47,308 --> 01:35:48,866
I lob it.

1859
01:35:48,943 --> 01:35:53,107
Harcourt Institute
of Table Tennis of Canoga Park.

1860
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:55,045
You'll all lob it too.

1861
01:36:01,122 --> 01:36:02,851
That's a...
I think that was a good one.

1862
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:04,584
I liked it.
That was good.
