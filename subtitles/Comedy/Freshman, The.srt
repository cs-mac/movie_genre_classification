1
00:00:38,946 --> 00:00:41,744
<i>There is one graduate here today</i>

2
00:00:42,283 --> 00:00:47,619
<i>that has won every single honor
and award this school gives out.</i>

3
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:54,287
<i>That graduate,
our friend, is Van Wilder!</i>

4
00:01:14,114 --> 00:01:18,448
<i>Standing here today,
I cannot help but wish I could stay</i>

5
00:01:18,552 --> 00:01:20,543
<i>in high school forever.</i>

6
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:24,286
<i>I mean, there are
so many warm mammories...</i>

7
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,186
<i>Memories I have of this place.</i>

8
00:01:30,831 --> 00:01:33,857
<i>But, you see, change, like life,</i>

9
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:37,566
<i>has a way of sneaking up on us.</i>

10
00:01:44,178 --> 00:01:47,443
<i>When we least expect it, yeah.</i>

11
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:55,144
<i>Sure, the timing may seem
very, very bad,</i>

12
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:02,524
<i>but yet it feels good, so good,</i>

13
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:06,898
<i>to be graduating
with some of the sharpest minds</i>

14
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:12,268
<i>and swiftly darting tongues
that this school has to offer.</i>

15
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,840
<i>Listen to me ramble.
I am really giving you a mouthful.</i>

16
00:02:18,412 --> 00:02:22,143
<i>But before I'm finished,
it is my extreme pleasure</i>

17
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:28,051
<i>to recognize someone who has aced
her oral exams,</i>

18
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:32,416
<i>who has always been head of the class,</i>

19
00:02:32,526 --> 00:02:38,192
<i>graduating summa cum</i>

20
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:49,338
<i>laude. Our very own valedictorian.</i>

21
00:03:01,388 --> 00:03:03,447
<i>Congratulations, graduates!</i>

22
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:12,696
-Congratulations, Son.
-Thanks.

23
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,166
Now, let's get out of here.
The sooner we get to Amsterdam,

24
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:17,760
the sooner we won't be able
to remember it.

25
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:18,929
Yeah.

26
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:25,376
-You're not going to Amsterdam.
-I can't.

27
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:28,312
Sheik Mohammad is building
an island outside of Dubai.

28
00:03:28,415 --> 00:03:31,350
And I'm gonna help him
import a million tons of sand.

29
00:03:31,452 --> 00:03:33,647
It's a huge opportunity, Van.

30
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:36,450
Come on. You're gonna have
a great time without me.

31
00:03:36,557 --> 00:03:38,787
Exploring nether regions
in the Netherlands

32
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:42,225
is not a bad way to spend
your summer before college.

33
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,991
I still don't know why I can't
just skip college and come work for you.

34
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,794
I mean, I know the business,
we could hang out...

35
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,563
Van, every Wilder man
has graduated from Coolidge.

36
00:03:50,671 --> 00:03:54,903
It's tradition. And tradition
is something you just don't break.

37
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,771
I gotta run. Hey, have a great time,

38
00:03:57,878 --> 00:03:59,641
do everything I wouldn't do,
and remember,

39
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:02,807
-''Banging, broke or blitzed...''
-''A Wilder never quits.''

40
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:05,542
Write that down.

41
00:06:06,273 --> 00:06:09,470
Well, well. Look who just arrived.

42
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:23,785
Van, do you have
to go back to the college?

43
00:06:23,891 --> 00:06:26,257
Come back to Amsterdam with us.

44
00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:32,532
Dulia, Babette, I'm sorry, ladies,
but I must.

45
00:06:43,877 --> 00:06:46,471
I've been waiting 30 years for this.

46
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:09,191
It's a little small, but I can work with it.

47
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:23,678
Van Wilder. I'm your new roommate.

48
00:07:25,953 --> 00:07:28,080
All right. Farley.

49
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:32,385
Smoke?

50
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:37,463
Man, am I glad
we are roommates, man!

51
00:07:37,564 --> 00:07:39,964
This place is a pimper's paradise.

52
00:07:42,102 --> 00:07:44,900
I'm gonna make
some of my special brownies.

53
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:12,098
My God!
We've been invaded by Supercuts!

54
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:16,295
-Lieutenant Dirk Arnold, ROTC.
-Corporal Benedict, ROTC.

55
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,262
Van Wilder, WTF?

56
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:24,310
The Honorable Dean Charles Reardon
requests your presence immediately.

57
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:26,606
But I just put my slippers on.

58
00:08:31,718 --> 00:08:33,481
Van Wilder, sir, as you ordered.

59
00:08:33,587 --> 00:08:35,384
Return to your squad.

60
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:37,823
Well, well, Mr. Wilder.

61
00:08:38,825 --> 00:08:40,656
Nice of you to join us.

62
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:43,286
Colonel Charles Reardon,
Dean, Coolidge College.

63
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,126
How's it hanging, Chuck?

64
00:08:45,232 --> 00:08:47,257
You see these fine young men, Wilder?

65
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:49,028
These are Reardon's Raiders.

66
00:08:49,136 --> 00:08:51,969
They've won every ROTC war game
for the past three years.

67
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:54,040
They're my pride and joy.

68
00:08:55,876 --> 00:08:59,903
Good doggies.
I especially like your Chihuahua.

69
00:09:01,848 --> 00:09:05,375
Lady Liberty is a purebred
Italian greyhound.

70
00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:08,416
Actually, I was talking about that guy.

71
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,651
Arnold!

72
00:09:11,658 --> 00:09:13,387
Secure Lady Liberty.

73
00:09:14,227 --> 00:09:16,991
Let's you and me take a little ride, son.

74
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,391
Stay.

75
00:09:23,203 --> 00:09:25,763
<i>-Good dog.
-Get the lead out, Wilder!</i>

76
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,968
You know, I went to school here
with your father.

77
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:32,067
He acted like he owned the place,

78
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:35,512
just 'cause his family's name
was on that building over there.

79
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:37,378
You know what that name
means to me?

80
00:09:37,484 --> 00:09:40,920
About as much as titties on a mule, son.
I run this outfit now.

81
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:44,218
And while you're here,
you'll follow Reardon's Rules.

82
00:09:44,324 --> 00:09:47,816
No drinking, no fornicating,
and no partying, period.

83
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:52,590
Or you'll be the first Wilder
who fails to graduate from Coolidge.

84
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:54,428
Now, do you follow me?

85
00:09:54,534 --> 00:09:57,401
Yes, sir! You prefer your mules titless!

86
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,571
Let's get one thing straight, son.

87
00:10:01,675 --> 00:10:05,076
I may not be able to kick you out of here
'cause of your daddy and his dough.

88
00:10:05,178 --> 00:10:09,137
But you screw with me,
and I'll make it so you'll pray to leave.

89
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:10,911
Out.

90
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,548
I'm glad we had this talk.

91
00:10:14,654 --> 00:10:17,714
Means there won't be
any problems in the future.

92
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:24,328
Party tonight, party tonight.
Party tonight, party tonight, thank you.

93
00:10:25,432 --> 00:10:29,198
You smell that, Farley?
That's the smell of opportunity.

94
00:10:29,302 --> 00:10:33,261
The smell of thousands of new girls.
The... Hello.

95
00:10:33,373 --> 00:10:36,831
Van Wilder, Chairman
of Freshman Relations, self-appointed.

96
00:10:36,943 --> 00:10:38,570
This is my partner, Farley Marley.

97
00:10:38,678 --> 00:10:42,580
-Jah Rastafari.
-He's from Jamaica.

98
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:44,343
-Right.
-We're having a little

99
00:10:44,451 --> 00:10:47,386
room-warming soiree tonight.
Nothing big, just a few hundred friends,

100
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:50,945
foam machine, nitrous, frappuccinos.
We would love it if you ladies came.

101
00:10:51,057 --> 00:10:53,389
-A party?
-You're joking, right?

102
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:03,169
No!

103
00:11:04,638 --> 00:11:05,969
It's okay.

104
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,770
Wow. This is embarrassing.

105
00:11:13,814 --> 00:11:16,214
I can't believe nobody showed up.

106
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:19,744
Well, it's about time.

107
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,451
Party?

108
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:35,326
So, Yu Dum Fok! You came all the way
here from China.

109
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:39,235
Yes. Village I grow up in boring as shit.

110
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:45,710
No party. I dream of beer bong,
bimbos, and boob on my butt.

111
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:49,705
So, I work in sweatshop,
save money, come here.

112
00:11:49,816 --> 00:11:53,582
Cannot even afford room,
have to sleep in janitor closet.

113
00:11:54,054 --> 00:11:58,115
That's one of the most beautiful things
I've ever heard, Yu Dum Fok.

114
00:11:58,225 --> 00:12:03,060
No offense to your ancestors,
but maybe we'll just call you Yu, Yu.

115
00:12:03,496 --> 00:12:07,091
Van, how come no hot,
young, American cat?

116
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,725
Coolidge is number one party school!

117
00:12:10,437 --> 00:12:13,736
1979. Wow!

118
00:12:15,275 --> 00:12:17,300
Girls used to have hair?

119
00:12:20,247 --> 00:12:23,045
I hate to break it to you, Yu,

120
00:12:23,516 --> 00:12:26,280
but I don't think
that's the case anymore.

121
00:12:27,153 --> 00:12:28,643
No party?

122
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,323
No beer bong?

123
00:12:32,726 --> 00:12:35,286
-No boob on butt?
-No.

124
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:39,363
I go to janitor closet now.
Drink ''breach.''

125
00:12:42,302 --> 00:12:43,360
Forget the ''breach.''

126
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:50,409
Boys, it's toga time.

127
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:22,569
Friends, Romans, grunting women,
lend me your beers.

128
00:13:51,404 --> 00:13:52,598
Welcome.

129
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,667
Nice jugs.

130
00:13:55,775 --> 00:13:58,539
They contain the sacred blood
of the lamb.

131
00:13:58,645 --> 00:14:00,704
Do you wish to be purified?

132
00:14:00,814 --> 00:14:03,248
We here for boob on butt.

133
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,612
Actually, I think we're lost.

134
00:14:07,988 --> 00:14:12,357
Come with me. My sisters
will take care of your friends.

135
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,552
I'm not sure if you're aware,
but in the past few years

136
00:14:16,663 --> 00:14:20,963
Coolidge has become a more
religious and conservative campus

137
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:22,830
than it used to be.

138
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:26,269
I'd better take these.

139
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,005
Alcohol is the devil's mouthwash.

140
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:31,277
At Coolidge, we're dry.

141
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:34,138
You know, science has made
incredible advancements

142
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:36,147
in personal lubrication.

143
00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:38,740
You won't be needing these, either.

144
00:14:39,486 --> 00:14:43,582
Orgasms are the deviI's heroin.
Just once, and you're hooked.

145
00:14:46,026 --> 00:14:51,965
''O daughters of Jerusalem,
do not awaken love until it is ready.''

146
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:53,555
-Amen.
-Amen.

147
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:55,867
Song of Solomon, 8:4.

148
00:14:57,804 --> 00:15:02,298
Let she who is without sin
grasp the first bone.

149
00:15:05,111 --> 00:15:07,136
Wilder, 69.

150
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:13,249
Perhaps you and your friends
should look into a different school.

151
00:15:13,353 --> 00:15:15,184
We have enough sinners here.

152
00:15:15,288 --> 00:15:17,779
You wouldn't happen to have
their phone numbers, would you?

153
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:20,121
You have a very impure spirit.

154
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:25,790
There's a dark, wretched hole
waiting for you.

155
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:29,964
Okay, but you have to buy me
a drink first.

156
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,831
I think that can be arranged.

157
00:15:33,873 --> 00:15:36,398
Now I know what a tampon feels like.

158
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,976
This is a complete fuckery,
you know, man.

159
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,378
No poom poom, no ganja.

160
00:15:42,849 --> 00:15:46,444
Vampires for Jesus,
throwing blood on us?

161
00:15:46,553 --> 00:15:50,580
-I can't take four years of this bullshit.
-We drink ''breach,'' get sent home.

162
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:55,389
Hey! No one's drinking ''breach!''
And no one's going home.

163
00:15:56,262 --> 00:15:58,423
So what did you have in mind?

164
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:07,200
We shake things up a bit.

165
00:16:19,152 --> 00:16:21,211
Why don't we just buy some?

166
00:16:22,222 --> 00:16:24,156
Where's the fun in that?

167
00:16:25,558 --> 00:16:28,356
This almost as good as boob on butt.

168
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:37,623
Say hello to my little friend.

169
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,940
Sorry.

170
00:17:57,217 --> 00:17:58,309
Don't forget to floss.

171
00:18:03,489 --> 00:18:06,788
Hi, Dirk. How's that big gun of yours?

172
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:09,794
-Hey, honeybear.
-Hey, honeybear!

173
00:18:10,163 --> 00:18:15,260
Kaitlin. So nice you could make it.
We missed you in Bible study again.

174
00:18:16,002 --> 00:18:17,663
-Hymnal?
-Whoa!

175
00:18:19,105 --> 00:18:21,403
Nice arm, Jezebel.

176
00:18:22,475 --> 00:18:25,103
-I believe this is yours.
-Thanks.

177
00:18:25,211 --> 00:18:28,237
Van Wilder, hopeless romantic.

178
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,110
-Kaitlin Hayes.
-My girlfriend.

179
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,349
Well, it's nice to see there are
some Christians

180
00:18:35,455 --> 00:18:37,514
who still do charity work.

181
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:40,984
Come on, Kaitlin, let's go.

182
00:18:42,795 --> 00:18:45,559
Yeah, before all the good seats
are taken!

183
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:48,633
No, thanks. I brought my own.

184
00:18:51,604 --> 00:18:52,662
Thank you.

185
00:18:52,805 --> 00:18:56,901
Today, I wanna talk about
something that's all over this school,

186
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:02,107
and it isn't pencils, no.
And it isn't books. But it's sin.

187
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:05,073
S-I-N. Sin.

188
00:19:05,618 --> 00:19:10,180
You know, it seems like they'll let just
about anybody in school these days.

189
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,155
Except Jesus.

190
00:19:12,258 --> 00:19:15,489
And, you know, I took the time
to check Jesus' transcripts,

191
00:19:15,595 --> 00:19:19,497
and I find out that Jesus has
a perfect GPA.

192
00:19:19,832 --> 00:19:22,528
Yeah, that stands
for God Point Average.

193
00:19:24,837 --> 00:19:27,271
Amen, amen.

194
00:19:27,373 --> 00:19:29,773
-Amen.
-Amen.

195
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:33,778
But what is the number one sin
on campus today?

196
00:19:35,415 --> 00:19:37,349
Quite plainly, it's sex.

197
00:19:38,117 --> 00:19:39,982
-Sex.
-S-E-X.

198
00:19:40,086 --> 00:19:41,485
-Sex.
-Sex.

199
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:46,355
Even as we're speaking,
the sinning is beginning. Amen!

200
00:19:46,459 --> 00:19:48,188
-Amen.
-Amen.

201
00:19:48,294 --> 00:19:49,318
Amen, sisters.

202
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:51,226
-Gentlemen, the Lord is...
-Hallelujah, sister!

203
00:19:51,331 --> 00:19:52,593
...about to work in very...
-Hallelujah!

204
00:19:52,699 --> 00:19:53,927
...mysterious ways.
-Hallelujah!

205
00:19:54,033 --> 00:19:57,901
That's right, sisters.
I want you to feel the Lord inside you.

206
00:19:59,205 --> 00:20:05,201
Because fornication, copulation
and the king of all sins, masturbation,

207
00:20:05,311 --> 00:20:09,304
is happening all around us,
even at this very moment.

208
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:11,576
-Amen!
-Amen!

209
00:20:12,251 --> 00:20:17,621
But we've got a secret because
we've got Jesus on our side.

210
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:20,420
Can I get an amen?

211
00:20:20,526 --> 00:20:21,891
-Amen!
-Amen!

212
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:25,191
Amen, sisters!
Yes, they're feeling it right now!

213
00:20:25,298 --> 00:20:28,631
They got the power of the Lord
deep down inside them.

214
00:20:28,735 --> 00:20:30,100
-Amen!
-Amen!

215
00:20:30,803 --> 00:20:32,930
Hallelujah, sister, hallelujah.

216
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,973
-Hallelujah!
-Hallelujah!

217
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:38,539
-I want each of you out there to pray.
-Amen.

218
00:20:38,644 --> 00:20:41,511
Pray that you might be
feeling what they're feeling.

219
00:20:41,614 --> 00:20:42,774
-Amen!
-Amen!

220
00:20:42,882 --> 00:20:45,248
Yes, they're talking to the big guy.

221
00:20:45,351 --> 00:20:46,841
-Amen!
-Amen!

222
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:49,421
Oh, the sisters are feeling
mighty good right now.

223
00:20:49,522 --> 00:20:51,888
-Amen, sisters!
-Amen!

224
00:20:51,991 --> 00:20:54,391
It's time for some tits and mass.

225
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:59,497
-Amen!
-Amen!

226
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,294
-Amen!
-Amen!

227
00:21:01,401 --> 00:21:02,663
Amen, sisters!

228
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:04,327
That's what I'm talking about!

229
00:21:04,437 --> 00:21:06,064
-Amen!
-Amen!

230
00:21:06,172 --> 00:21:09,039
You might as well open up
your pearly gates, dear Lord.

231
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:12,509
'Cause these sisters are coming!
These sisters are coming!

232
00:21:12,612 --> 00:21:14,546
These sisters are coming!

233
00:21:14,647 --> 00:21:16,046
-Amen!
-Amen!

234
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,218
You know what these are?

235
00:21:19,318 --> 00:21:20,075
You know what these are?

236
00:21:21,554 --> 00:21:22,885
Yes, sir.

237
00:21:24,123 --> 00:21:27,559
And I think experimentation
is healthy for any marriage.

238
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,892
You listen to me, funny man.
I can't prove it, but I know it was you.

239
00:21:32,665 --> 00:21:36,226
And you can rest assured,
I will get to the bottom of this.

240
00:21:36,335 --> 00:21:39,634
In this case, Chuck,
may I recommend some Vaseline.

241
00:21:42,742 --> 00:21:47,645
You know, nowadays,
the Dean has much more influence

242
00:21:48,347 --> 00:21:50,474
over a student's curriculum.

243
00:21:50,817 --> 00:21:54,014
And I have got something special
in store for you.

244
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,647
Something to build character.
Something to make you a man.

245
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:03,825
-Left, left, left, left, left, left...
-Left, left, left, left, left, left...

246
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,591
I'm gonna take a stab in the dark
and say

247
00:22:05,698 --> 00:22:08,565
that none of you signed up
for this, either.

248
00:22:12,305 --> 00:22:15,172
Well, if they think
that we came to college

249
00:22:15,274 --> 00:22:18,072
to waste our time playing soldier

250
00:22:18,177 --> 00:22:23,274
to some slack-jawed, pituitary-pumping,
testosterone-tweaking Neanderthal,

251
00:22:23,382 --> 00:22:25,043
then they...

252
00:22:28,454 --> 00:22:30,922
Are 100% correct.

253
00:22:31,023 --> 00:22:33,856
Attention! Straight line! Eyes forward!

254
00:22:35,528 --> 00:22:38,986
I'm Corporal Hayes.
I will be your drill instructor.

255
00:22:39,098 --> 00:22:42,795
It's my job to guide you
through your ROTC physical training,

256
00:22:42,902 --> 00:22:46,167
which is required to graduate
from this institution.

257
00:22:46,706 --> 00:22:48,640
Are there any questions?

258
00:22:50,076 --> 00:22:51,270
Yes, soldier.

259
00:22:51,377 --> 00:22:54,813
Do you, by chance, drill in private?

260
00:22:55,915 --> 00:22:57,280
Well, Mr. Wilder, if you'd like,

261
00:22:57,383 --> 00:23:01,820
I'm sure I can arrange for us to spend
a little one-on-one time together.

262
00:23:03,022 --> 00:23:05,217
This a new experience for you?

263
00:23:06,692 --> 00:23:07,750
Yeah.

264
00:23:08,628 --> 00:23:12,291
I usually go electric.
Helps get those hard-to-reach spots.

265
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,067
Hilarious. I've met guys like you before.

266
00:23:17,603 --> 00:23:20,401
The only person you care about
is yourself.

267
00:23:21,807 --> 00:23:23,672
-Something funny?
-Yeah.

268
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,304
I just can't wait to prove you wrong.

269
00:23:27,747 --> 00:23:29,112
We'll see.

270
00:23:29,215 --> 00:23:31,843
Oh, and by the way, you missed a spot.

271
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:34,247
Enjoy.

272
00:23:44,196 --> 00:23:46,994
I'm sorry. I ordered mine well-done.

273
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,904
I have better food in sweatshop.

274
00:23:53,005 --> 00:23:55,200
Oh, it can't be that bad, Yu.

275
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:11,779
-What? I had the munchies.
-Well, look what we have here.

276
00:24:13,192 --> 00:24:14,420
I haven't seen this many turds

277
00:24:14,527 --> 00:24:17,587
since I won
that campus hot-dog eating contest.

278
00:24:18,431 --> 00:24:23,300
Yeah, I haven't seen this many pansies
since I was picking flowers yesterday.

279
00:24:23,402 --> 00:24:26,337
Remember, I was making
that arrangement, and the...

280
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:28,532
So how's the chow, ladies?

281
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:32,099
I give the presentation three stars,
I really do,

282
00:24:32,211 --> 00:24:34,873
but the pseudo meat, it's a little dry.

283
00:24:50,963 --> 00:24:53,955
-There you go. All better.
-Yum, yum, yum.

284
00:24:58,004 --> 00:25:00,063
You know, I heard they were looking
for a few good men,

285
00:25:00,172 --> 00:25:03,232
but I guess they'll take
whatever they can get.

286
00:25:05,945 --> 00:25:10,075
-Hey, Dirk.
-Kaitlin! Hey, honeybear, hi!

287
00:25:11,317 --> 00:25:12,375
What are you boys up to?

288
00:25:12,485 --> 00:25:15,682
Well, we were just congratulating
these fine young soldiers here

289
00:25:15,788 --> 00:25:19,554
on their first day of duty.
You know me, Lieutenant Friendly.

290
00:25:20,226 --> 00:25:23,684
Lieutenant Friendly here even
volunteered to switch meals with me.

291
00:25:23,796 --> 00:25:25,559
Oh, what a nice guy.

292
00:25:33,973 --> 00:25:36,908
Yum, yum. That is so good.

293
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:40,438
How's yours, Dirk?

294
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,748
Oh, God.

295
00:25:59,298 --> 00:26:00,890
Well, how was it?

296
00:26:05,671 --> 00:26:07,662
Always leading by example.

297
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:13,071
-So, are we still going to the game?
-Oh, I...

298
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:14,703
You bet we are!

299
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:16,807
What game?

300
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:19,544
-There's a football game this weekend.
-Really?

301
00:26:19,652 --> 00:26:21,779
These losers haven't won
a game in years.

302
00:26:21,887 --> 00:26:23,013
Come on, it's not about winning
or losing.

303
00:26:23,122 --> 00:26:25,317
It's about supporting your school.

304
00:26:25,424 --> 00:26:28,325
You know what? You are so right, babe.
School spirit.

305
00:26:28,427 --> 00:26:29,689
Okay, well I'm gonna get back to class.

306
00:26:29,795 --> 00:26:31,319
Okay. Bye.

307
00:26:32,998 --> 00:26:37,094
All right, guess what, queerbait?
You're officially on my bad side.

308
00:26:48,981 --> 00:26:53,350
The team's a joke, but the concessions
will probably buy me a new Humvee.

309
00:26:57,022 --> 00:26:58,148
Right.

310
00:26:58,257 --> 00:27:01,522
I take bigger hits than these guys
for breakfast.

311
00:27:02,228 --> 00:27:03,820
No, it's not the team's fault.

312
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:07,057
-You guys, come on!
-They've got no inspiration.

313
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:10,600
<i>It looks like the cheerleaders are
asking for a little divine intervention.</i>

314
00:27:10,703 --> 00:27:12,398
I'll be right back.

315
00:27:13,606 --> 00:27:15,369
Where you going, man?

316
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:17,573
To fix this.

317
00:27:22,581 --> 00:27:26,073
I have never seen
such a sorry display in all my life.

318
00:27:26,652 --> 00:27:28,984
I mean, where's the fire?
Where is the intensity?

319
00:27:29,088 --> 00:27:32,922
And for God's sake,
where are the tight ends?

320
00:27:33,793 --> 00:27:35,693
Your team needs you out there.

321
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:40,231
Okay, being a cheerleader isn't
about pigtails and pompoms.

322
00:27:40,332 --> 00:27:43,824
It's about standing by your team,
even when they suck.

323
00:27:43,936 --> 00:27:47,201
Especially when they suck.

324
00:27:47,306 --> 00:27:48,295
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

325
00:27:48,407 --> 00:27:49,738
Now, do you think you can do that?

326
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:50,900
-Yes.
-Yes.

327
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,638
Do you think you can give it
the old college try?

328
00:27:53,746 --> 00:27:54,770
-Yes.
-Yes.

329
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,408
Do you think maybe, just maybe,
you can help those guys score?

330
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:00,815
-Yes!
-Yes!

331
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,115
That's what I'm talking about.

332
00:28:03,956 --> 00:28:08,052
But first, we're gonna have
to make a few cuts.

333
00:28:17,937 --> 00:28:19,700
Who knew our cheerleaders were hot?

334
00:28:19,805 --> 00:28:22,296
Who knew our cheerleaders
were women?

335
00:28:23,642 --> 00:28:26,406
Hey, guys.
The girls have done their part.

336
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:28,642
Now it's your turn.

337
00:28:30,816 --> 00:28:33,717
Oh, and they said
that if you win this thing,

338
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:36,413
they're throwing you a victory party.

339
00:28:37,556 --> 00:28:41,617
Victory party, guys. All right, let's go.
One, two, three...

340
00:28:41,727 --> 00:28:43,456
-Coolidge!
-Coolidge!

341
00:28:45,664 --> 00:28:48,360
Come on! I know you can do it, now.

342
00:28:49,301 --> 00:28:50,893
<i>I tell you,
I don't know whose idea it was,</i>

343
00:28:51,003 --> 00:28:55,337
<i>but these cheerleaders are grinding it
harder than Juan Valdez.</i>

344
00:28:57,109 --> 00:28:58,474
What the...

345
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,478
Sweet Jesus!

346
00:29:28,774 --> 00:29:31,242
Now, that's what I'm talking about!

347
00:30:44,283 --> 00:30:45,910
Watch your head!

348
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:55,822
Guys, give me a ride.

349
00:31:13,345 --> 00:31:14,369
Hey!

350
00:31:15,381 --> 00:31:17,508
-School spirit?
-No, thanks.

351
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,742
How about a beer?

352
00:31:24,823 --> 00:31:26,222
In a bottle.

353
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:32,058
I shouldn't be here.

354
00:31:49,481 --> 00:31:50,948
Hey, wait up!

355
00:31:53,452 --> 00:31:54,783
I'll walk you back to your dorm.

356
00:31:54,887 --> 00:31:58,345
I'm sorry. I just... I can't afford to do
anything that might jeopardize

357
00:31:58,457 --> 00:32:01,915
-getting into officer-training school.
-Understandable.

358
00:32:03,162 --> 00:32:05,187
I must seem
like such a Goody Two-shoes.

359
00:32:05,297 --> 00:32:06,355
No.

360
00:32:07,032 --> 00:32:08,897
I was gonna say prude.

361
00:32:16,742 --> 00:32:20,872
<i>You know, you should read
The Art of War by Sun Tzu.</i>

362
00:32:22,581 --> 00:32:26,449
He say, ''All great warfare
is based on deception.

363
00:32:27,686 --> 00:32:30,086
''Offer the enemy bait to lure him.

364
00:32:30,589 --> 00:32:33,888
''Feign disorder and crush him.''

365
00:32:37,196 --> 00:32:38,356
Or her.

366
00:32:39,598 --> 00:32:41,566
He also says we cannot enter alliances

367
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:45,125
until we know the designs
of our neighbors. Good night.

368
00:32:49,108 --> 00:32:52,202
You're not even going to let me
escort you to your room?

369
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:55,246
Now, what kind of a prude
would that make me?

370
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:34,751
Hey, where'd you come from?

371
00:33:37,823 --> 00:33:40,291
Broke out of your little cage, huh?

372
00:33:42,227 --> 00:33:43,751
What the hell?

373
00:33:45,597 --> 00:33:47,428
Oh, my God.

374
00:33:49,735 --> 00:33:51,760
You're my new best friend.

375
00:33:52,404 --> 00:33:53,871
Here's to you.

376
00:33:56,441 --> 00:33:57,703
Colossus.

377
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,342
-Hey.
-Hey.

378
00:33:59,444 --> 00:34:00,877
Hi! Great party.

379
00:34:00,979 --> 00:34:03,709
Don't thank me. Thank tequila.
What's up?

380
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,276
Found your pants.

381
00:34:12,758 --> 00:34:17,058
Van, I took your advice about shaving
my excess body hair, and it worked.

382
00:34:17,162 --> 00:34:18,993
She said I'd get laid tonight.

383
00:34:19,097 --> 00:34:21,156
-What's her major?
-Pre-law.

384
00:34:22,434 --> 00:34:24,629
-Get it in writing.
-Hey, Van.

385
00:34:26,038 --> 00:34:30,475
Hey, guys, guys, guys,
I will get to all of you later, I promise.

386
00:34:33,111 --> 00:34:34,135
Wow!

387
00:34:36,481 --> 00:34:39,507
Hey, big man on campus.

388
00:34:40,419 --> 00:34:46,119
-A blessing and a curse.
-Van! Van, I need your help.

389
00:34:47,192 --> 00:34:48,593
-Calm down, Yu.
-I meet girl in class, ''berry'' sexy.

390
00:34:48,693 --> 00:34:51,785
-Calm down, Yu.
-I meet girl in class, ''berry'' sexy.

391
00:34:52,331 --> 00:34:56,165
So I say she beautiful.
She say, ''Get lost!''

392
00:34:56,268 --> 00:35:00,227
So I say she smart. She say, ''Get lost!''

393
00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:05,834
So I say, ''I know Van Wilder,''
and she say, ''Where your room?''

394
00:35:06,211 --> 00:35:09,840
Things heating up,
but first I give her Connie ring ass.

395
00:35:09,948 --> 00:35:12,246
-Connie who?
-Connie ring ass!

396
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:14,285
-Ring ass?
-Ring ass!

397
00:35:14,386 --> 00:35:17,446
-Cunnilingus!
-Oh, right!

398
00:35:18,223 --> 00:35:20,817
So next thing, she cry, she run out!

399
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,727
Show me what you did.

400
00:35:43,715 --> 00:35:48,049
Jesus, man! You're lucky you didn't
send her to the fucking hospital.

401
00:35:49,755 --> 00:35:51,723
Where did you learn that?

402
00:35:53,425 --> 00:35:57,020
-Sex ''crass.''
-What sex ''crass''?

403
00:35:57,963 --> 00:36:01,729
Now, sex is achieved when
a male's sin stick is in, on,

404
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:03,733
or in the same room as

405
00:36:03,835 --> 00:36:05,928
a female's hell hole.

406
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,699
Now, no matter what the woman says,

407
00:36:07,806 --> 00:36:11,435
the act of procreation should only last
for a few seconds.

408
00:36:12,311 --> 00:36:15,747
And remember, if it feels good,
you're doing it wrong.

409
00:36:16,915 --> 00:36:20,248
Professor Downs!
There's an emergency phone call.

410
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:24,152
-Your wife was in an accident.
-Tell her I'll call her later.

411
00:36:24,256 --> 00:36:27,054
-And she totaled your Mustang.
-That bitch!

412
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:31,359
-Class, turn to pages 20 to 22 and...
-Hello.

413
00:36:33,031 --> 00:36:34,225
Wake up!

414
00:36:35,033 --> 00:36:39,766
My name is Professor Wilder.

415
00:36:40,539 --> 00:36:46,307
I have BA, an MA and a PhD.
And I received a BJ from a double-D.

416
00:36:49,948 --> 00:36:52,348
These are my teaching assistants.

417
00:36:54,886 --> 00:36:57,150
Welcome to Sex 101.

418
00:36:59,057 --> 00:37:00,319
This is hot.

419
00:37:00,425 --> 00:37:01,790
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

420
00:37:03,762 --> 00:37:04,922
This is not.

421
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,395
-No!
-No!

422
00:37:08,867 --> 00:37:09,993
Hand?

423
00:37:11,236 --> 00:37:12,294
Bad!

424
00:37:13,605 --> 00:37:16,369
We call this maneuver ''flanking.''

425
00:37:21,446 --> 00:37:23,539
Who can name this position?

426
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:28,246
-Yu.
-Glass Bottom Boat!

427
00:37:28,353 --> 00:37:29,820
And this one.

428
00:37:31,523 --> 00:37:33,150
Analingus!

429
00:37:33,258 --> 00:37:36,921
-And that one.
-Mississippi Kiss the Gypsy.

430
00:37:37,396 --> 00:37:42,163
Spraying Mantis.
Horny Dancer. Superman.

431
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:45,631
The Gizzard of Oz!

432
00:37:46,938 --> 00:37:48,633
That's my favorite.

433
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:54,072
-Ladies.
-Hello, hands, meet the glans.

434
00:37:54,212 --> 00:37:57,409
-And?
-Don't be daft, work the shaft.

435
00:37:58,283 --> 00:38:02,310
-Guys.
-Don't be a twit, rub that clit.

436
00:38:03,021 --> 00:38:04,613
You're learning!

437
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:08,423
Now, remember,
always practice safe sex.

438
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:12,463
But clean up after yourselves.
Condoms are like newspapers.

439
00:38:12,564 --> 00:38:14,088
They may be filled
with important stuff now,

440
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:17,657
but you don't want them lying around
tomorrow morning.

441
00:38:18,136 --> 00:38:19,728
Write that down.

442
00:38:24,075 --> 00:38:25,440
Miss Hayes.

443
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:30,642
I'll let it slide this time,
but if you plan on being teacher's pet

444
00:38:30,749 --> 00:38:33,718
-you really should stay after class.
-Class?

445
00:38:35,086 --> 00:38:36,314
You're kidding, right?

446
00:38:36,421 --> 00:38:40,653
Nothing from that soft-core seminar
would actually work in real life.

447
00:38:41,026 --> 00:38:43,586
Okay, I give you tongue if you like.

448
00:38:45,363 --> 00:38:48,855
The point is you put on
a disgusting display of vulgar anatomy,

449
00:38:48,967 --> 00:38:50,662
crude stereotypes and dirty limericks.

450
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:53,067
Which you took copious notes on.

451
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:55,704
This is all a game to you.

452
00:38:55,807 --> 00:38:59,106
It's a lot of smooth talk, and then it's
wham, bam, thank you, Van.

453
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,907
Well, my father taught me,
if it's something worth doing,

454
00:39:02,013 --> 00:39:03,947
it's worth doing right.

455
00:39:04,049 --> 00:39:06,574
Well, my father taught me
that the best things in life

456
00:39:06,685 --> 00:39:08,516
are worth waiting for.

457
00:39:11,623 --> 00:39:13,955
-Wait.
-Catch you later, teach.

458
00:39:14,459 --> 00:39:19,453
Van! Van! Okay, thank you, thank you.

459
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:28,068
-I'm Yu.
-I'm Dongmei.

460
00:39:37,949 --> 00:39:42,682
You know, I am not sure what it is,
but there is something in the air tonight.

461
00:39:43,722 --> 00:39:44,814
Something called...

462
00:39:44,923 --> 00:39:46,254
Love, girl.

463
00:39:47,325 --> 00:39:50,021
See, that's what the reggae music
is all about.

464
00:39:50,128 --> 00:39:51,152
Love and...

465
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,423
Shrimp?

466
00:40:07,746 --> 00:40:09,008
Look at those.

467
00:40:09,114 --> 00:40:11,674
Flamethrowers! Use the flamethrowers!

468
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:18,586
Permission to come inside, sir?

469
00:40:19,624 --> 00:40:21,558
Kaitlin, you look like a...

470
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,888
Tramp!

471
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:26,029
That's what I feel like sometimes.

472
00:40:26,631 --> 00:40:29,930
I mean, I know she has a boyfriend,
but it's like...

473
00:40:31,403 --> 00:40:34,634
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be boring you with all this.

474
00:40:36,908 --> 00:40:40,036
Here. I have a little surprise for us.

475
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:55,191
Sweet and sour.

476
00:40:56,828 --> 00:41:00,286
Ready, aim, fire!

477
00:41:07,906 --> 00:41:09,498
Kaitlin, what's gotten into you?

478
00:41:09,608 --> 00:41:12,975
Let's just say I learned
a few things in class today.

479
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,448
Kaitlin, I need my energy.

480
00:41:17,549 --> 00:41:20,177
I have to pass
that obstacle course in the morning.

481
00:41:20,285 --> 00:41:22,276
I'll give you an obstacle.

482
00:41:24,856 --> 00:41:26,084
Don't.

483
00:42:00,058 --> 00:42:02,720
I am so glad you weren't busy tonight.

484
00:42:09,501 --> 00:42:10,832
Go ahead.

485
00:42:38,897 --> 00:42:40,228
God.

486
00:42:44,169 --> 00:42:46,729
Put some of Professor Van's
methods to the test last night?

487
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:48,567
You wish. What about you?

488
00:42:48,673 --> 00:42:52,803
I figured you'd be in Wilder Hall
sucking beers with Susie Sorority.

489
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,878
Travel books.

490
00:42:56,915 --> 00:43:00,043
<i>I always had you pegged
as more of a Soldier of Fortune girl.</i>

491
00:43:00,151 --> 00:43:02,847
Traveling's one of the reasons
why I wanna be in the military.

492
00:43:02,954 --> 00:43:04,251
To see the world.

493
00:43:04,355 --> 00:43:08,189
You know, there are vacations
that don't involve machine guns.

494
00:43:08,793 --> 00:43:10,090
Oh, right.

495
00:43:10,628 --> 00:43:12,994
Spring break in Mexico,
winters in the Caribbean.

496
00:43:13,098 --> 00:43:15,692
You probably spent summer
in Amsterdam.

497
00:43:17,368 --> 00:43:22,601
I think it's important to familiarize
oneself with international tongues.

498
00:43:23,742 --> 00:43:27,872
-Life's just one big party, isn't it?
-Why shouldn't it be?

499
00:43:28,513 --> 00:43:31,277
Last time I checked,
we only go around once, right?

500
00:43:31,382 --> 00:43:33,748
Unless you believe in reincarnation.

501
00:43:33,852 --> 00:43:37,948
In that case, I wanna come back
as a ThighMaster.

502
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:41,618
What?

503
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,357
Hey! Wait up!

504
00:43:47,999 --> 00:43:50,593
You know, you could be
a great leader if you just learned

505
00:43:50,702 --> 00:43:52,192
how to follow orders first.

506
00:43:52,303 --> 00:43:54,794
Not a big fan
of authority figures, actually.

507
00:43:54,906 --> 00:43:57,966
-Someone has father issues.
-That makes two of us.

508
00:43:58,076 --> 00:44:00,010
-Excuse me?
-Come on.

509
00:44:00,745 --> 00:44:03,976
The whole military routine,
the tough exterior.

510
00:44:04,082 --> 00:44:06,073
You don't know anything
about my father or me.

511
00:44:06,184 --> 00:44:08,846
-You just see a uniform and...
-You just see a name on a building.

512
00:44:08,953 --> 00:44:11,513
Well, why don't you surprise me?

513
00:44:11,623 --> 00:44:16,026
All right. First of all,
I've never even been in Wilder Hall.

514
00:44:17,028 --> 00:44:20,191
And secondly,
for someone who's so big on rules,

515
00:44:23,434 --> 00:44:24,662
here it is.

516
00:44:24,769 --> 00:44:27,169
''Student undergarments should be
as modest

517
00:44:27,272 --> 00:44:29,706
''and unrevealing as possible.''

518
00:44:30,408 --> 00:44:33,844
-So?
-So my sixth sense is telling me...

519
00:44:36,948 --> 00:44:39,849
-You're a thong girl.
-What? No, I'm not.

520
00:44:40,418 --> 00:44:43,444
-My sixth sense does not lie.
-Well, it does this time.

521
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:45,455
And in the future,
you might want to keep it,

522
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:50,051
and the rest of your senses to yourself.
Some things are private, Private.

523
00:44:55,633 --> 00:45:00,764
Corporal, I think it's time we take things
to the next level.

524
00:45:01,306 --> 00:45:04,207
I have waited so long
to hear you say that.

525
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:06,277
-What?
-Nothing, I...

526
00:45:08,046 --> 00:45:10,810
Eve! Jesus, you almost scared
the courage out of me.

527
00:45:10,915 --> 00:45:13,679
Hey, Dirk, I was just wondering
if you could help me.

528
00:45:13,785 --> 00:45:16,276
-With what?
-I need to talk to God.

529
00:45:16,387 --> 00:45:17,979
So go talk to him. I'm busy.

530
00:45:18,089 --> 00:45:20,557
I need to feel him inside of me.

531
00:45:23,661 --> 00:45:25,754
Don't you wanna help me find God?

532
00:45:25,864 --> 00:45:29,300
-Listen. I don't know what you're on...
-Just fuck me!

533
00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:32,234
Get away from me, devil woman!

534
00:45:32,337 --> 00:45:33,361
-Dirk!
-Faster!

535
00:45:33,471 --> 00:45:34,438
You get back here!

536
00:45:35,139 --> 00:45:37,471
Yes, I bought you toilet paper.

537
00:45:37,575 --> 00:45:40,305
No, it's not quilted. Golly!

538
00:45:44,883 --> 00:45:47,113
I won't ask if you don't tell?

539
00:45:50,488 --> 00:45:53,582
What the... Hey, put me down!

540
00:45:57,896 --> 00:46:00,126
Is this where you bring all the boys?

541
00:46:00,231 --> 00:46:02,563
Oh, yeah, you're a real comedian.

542
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:06,398
You like cracking your jokes,
throwing your little parties,

543
00:46:06,871 --> 00:46:09,738
sticking your tongue
in other people's property?

544
00:46:09,841 --> 00:46:12,309
Can someone get this guy a Tic Tac?

545
00:46:13,111 --> 00:46:16,512
Well, I got news for you, Mr. Cool Guy,

546
00:46:16,614 --> 00:46:21,517
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll, Mr. Hot Crotch!

547
00:46:23,221 --> 00:46:28,124
Your party-boy bullshit
has no place here at Coolidge.

548
00:46:28,226 --> 00:46:30,626
And you're about to find out
the hard way.

549
00:46:30,728 --> 00:46:31,717
I wanna watch!

550
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:34,855
This should teach you
not to mess with my girl.

551
00:46:39,704 --> 00:46:40,932
Hold him!

552
00:46:44,108 --> 00:46:46,167
Come on, Wilder. Drink up!

553
00:46:51,049 --> 00:46:52,448
Had enough?

554
00:46:53,318 --> 00:46:56,913
You wouldn't happen to have
a pale ale on tap, would you?

555
00:46:59,057 --> 00:47:00,285
Screw it.

556
00:47:04,012 --> 00:47:05,570
How your face feel?

557
00:47:07,415 --> 00:47:09,110
Like a punching bag.

558
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:12,276
Maybe you should find another girl.

559
00:47:13,021 --> 00:47:15,489
No, it's not just the girl, Farley.

560
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:20,652
Dirk and Reardon and all the rest
of those Cro-Magnon crotch diggers

561
00:47:20,762 --> 00:47:24,357
need to learn they can't run
this place like Guantanamo U.

562
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:33,740
Oh, man! Who's been feeding
that dog corn again?

563
00:47:38,013 --> 00:47:40,481
Farley, get some gloves.

564
00:47:44,753 --> 00:47:46,380
All right, girls!

565
00:47:49,124 --> 00:47:52,855
This is covert ops! I want it by the book!

566
00:47:52,961 --> 00:47:54,292
Now camo up! Let's go!

567
00:47:54,396 --> 00:47:56,591
-Sir, yes, sir!
-Sir, yes, sir!

568
00:47:57,732 --> 00:48:00,963
-Jesus, it smells.
-Come on! Faster! Move! Yeah!

569
00:48:01,536 --> 00:48:02,833
Put it on!

570
00:48:03,872 --> 00:48:05,567
Mother of God!

571
00:48:06,775 --> 00:48:09,107
Sir, he's right. It smells like...

572
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:11,940
What do you want it
to smell like? Roses?

573
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,711
Put it on!

574
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:26,985
All right, troops, one mile left.
Double time! Let's go!

575
00:48:29,731 --> 00:48:33,064
-What happened to your face?
-I ran into a tool.

576
00:48:40,275 --> 00:48:41,765
Oh, Dirk!

577
00:48:41,876 --> 00:48:45,334
Not now, honeybear,
we're in the middle of covert ops!

578
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,314
-What's that smell?
-That smell?

579
00:48:48,416 --> 00:48:50,714
-Yeah.
-It's the smell of war!

580
00:48:53,588 --> 00:48:55,579
Well, it smells like crap.

581
00:49:01,096 --> 00:49:05,123
-Is that corn?
-Back to base showers now!

582
00:49:07,635 --> 00:49:09,398
Ran into a tool, huh?

583
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,640
-Wilder is dead!
-Dirk, what are you doing here?

584
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,651
-It's against the rules.
-I don't care about the rules.

585
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,221
-Now you sound like Van.
-No. No, no, no.

586
00:49:27,322 --> 00:49:30,052
Don't you dare say that name to me!
I don't even wanna...

587
00:49:30,158 --> 00:49:34,322
I don't even wanna hear that name!

588
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:37,830
-Dirk, calm down.
-You're forbidden to see him again.

589
00:49:37,932 --> 00:49:39,957
Excuse me?
You can't tell me who to see.

590
00:49:40,068 --> 00:49:41,365
Oh, you heard me, Corporal.

591
00:49:41,469 --> 00:49:44,905
I don't want you to see him.
You don't talk to him. Period!

592
00:49:45,874 --> 00:49:48,342
Or what? You'll beat him up again?

593
00:49:48,843 --> 00:49:51,710
He's not one of us, Kaitlin!

594
00:49:52,881 --> 00:49:54,371
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

595
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:59,314
Well, then, I don't wanna be one of us,
either. Get out, Dirk!

596
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:02,480
Wait, what? You can't break up with me.

597
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:05,354
We have cuddle-wuddle time
at 2100 hours.

598
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,489
Cuddle your gun.

599
00:50:13,501 --> 00:50:15,992
Oh, and you can keep
Major McHuggles!

600
00:50:30,952 --> 00:50:32,715
Where are the others?

601
00:50:33,221 --> 00:50:34,813
Just you and me today, soldier.

602
00:50:34,923 --> 00:50:37,892
Figured you need
a little one-on-one training.

603
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,752
You have 10 minutes to run the course.

604
00:50:40,862 --> 00:50:43,057
Let's see if you can keep up.

605
00:50:43,698 --> 00:50:45,859
Care to make it interesting?

606
00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:49,034
If I win, you have to let me take you out.

607
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:52,203
Nothing sexual,
just a tour around campus.

608
00:50:52,874 --> 00:50:54,239
And if you don't?

609
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:56,742
I'll do latrine duty for a month.

610
00:50:57,212 --> 00:51:00,181
-You're on.
-Great. When do I start?

611
00:51:00,648 --> 00:51:02,275
You already have.

612
00:52:20,895 --> 00:52:22,886
You're running out of time!

613
00:52:22,997 --> 00:52:24,988
I can't. I don't have any...

614
00:52:25,099 --> 00:52:29,331
Come on. You have 10 seconds.
Ten, nine, eight...

615
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,170
Hey, Wilder!

616
00:52:32,407 --> 00:52:34,466
Do you want this, or what?

617
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:44,051
I knew you had it in you.

618
00:52:44,152 --> 00:52:45,619
Piece of cake.

619
00:52:46,487 --> 00:52:49,285
Let me know if you find my right testicle.

620
00:52:49,757 --> 00:52:52,692
Come on, milk dud.
I'll buy you an ice cream.

621
00:52:54,162 --> 00:52:55,129
Mother!

622
00:52:56,164 --> 00:52:57,495
All right.

623
00:53:01,536 --> 00:53:03,470
Look at 'em, Lieutenant.

624
00:53:03,905 --> 00:53:06,806
Morons, listening to their retard rock.

625
00:53:07,108 --> 00:53:10,635
Horn dogs, tongue-dancing,
like cousins in a closet.

626
00:53:10,745 --> 00:53:12,713
You see what's happening down there,
don't you?

627
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:15,146
Chaos, anarchy, ironic T-shirts.

628
00:53:17,318 --> 00:53:21,186
I'm losing control, damn it,
and I refuse to let that happen.

629
00:53:21,289 --> 00:53:23,655
Do you know who's behind it, sir?

630
00:53:24,392 --> 00:53:26,155
I know who's behind it, all right.

631
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:30,321
It's that same rooster that's been
sniffing around your hen house.

632
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:38,097
Looks like somebody
needs another beating!

633
00:53:38,206 --> 00:53:39,673
Forget it.

634
00:53:39,774 --> 00:53:41,605
Beating him up is like beating off.

635
00:53:41,709 --> 00:53:43,973
It might feel good doing it,
but in the end,

636
00:53:44,078 --> 00:53:46,137
we're just standing there
with our dicks in our hands.

637
00:53:46,247 --> 00:53:49,410
-No. We need something more.
-I could...

638
00:53:50,651 --> 00:53:52,380
Beat up his roommate, sir.

639
00:53:52,487 --> 00:53:54,955
God damn it, boy. You stupid?

640
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:57,347
Wait a minute.

641
00:53:58,326 --> 00:54:00,226
Isn't his roommate that pothead?

642
00:54:00,328 --> 00:54:01,727
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

643
00:54:03,164 --> 00:54:05,462
Lieutenant, I have got an idea.

644
00:54:42,503 --> 00:54:45,529
Milady, your chariot awaits.

645
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,933
-How did you get this?
-Chuck lent it to me.

646
00:54:49,644 --> 00:54:51,168
We go way back.

647
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:53,940
Thanks.

648
00:55:02,056 --> 00:55:03,489
This is incredible.

649
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:05,616
You said you always
wanted to see the world.

650
00:55:05,726 --> 00:55:08,092
I thought we'd start with the tropics.

651
00:55:08,196 --> 00:55:12,098
Oh, I almost forgot,
the most important part.

652
00:55:15,336 --> 00:55:17,827
-What is it?
-It's my own concoction.

653
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:20,703
-I call it the amputated leg.
-Why?

654
00:55:20,808 --> 00:55:24,539
'Cause if you have more
than one, you're flat on your ass.

655
00:55:40,528 --> 00:55:44,055
Christ! Look at this place.
It's like a homo's paradise.

656
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,994
-You want a cosmo?
-Put that down! Put it down!

657
00:55:49,103 --> 00:55:51,162
Get over here! Stupid ass.

658
00:55:53,307 --> 00:55:55,036
You have the stuff?

659
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:59,111
You have no idea
where I had to hide this.

660
00:56:02,183 --> 00:56:04,048
Put it over there in that plant thingy.

661
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:07,451
Technically, that's a variegated ficus.
It really...

662
00:56:17,899 --> 00:56:19,389
Yes, hello. I'd like to report
the possession

663
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,491
of some illegal narcotics.

664
00:56:22,336 --> 00:56:25,305
I can't believe I'm doing this,
blowing off my homework,

665
00:56:25,406 --> 00:56:28,500
drinking and riding
in a stolen vehicle, no less.

666
00:56:28,609 --> 00:56:30,304
God bless America.

667
00:56:31,712 --> 00:56:35,113
You know, what you've done here,
it's pretty great.

668
00:56:35,216 --> 00:56:37,776
Well, Farley's the one
who scooped out the pineapple.

669
00:56:37,885 --> 00:56:41,252
Shut up. I mean here, this, Coolidge.

670
00:56:42,156 --> 00:56:44,818
I don't know. People seem happier.

671
00:56:45,393 --> 00:56:47,452
That's because
they're thinking for themselves.

672
00:56:47,562 --> 00:56:49,860
They don't have some father figure
telling them what to do.

673
00:56:49,964 --> 00:56:52,159
Oh, back to the father issues.

674
00:56:54,135 --> 00:56:56,069
You know a little bit about mine.

675
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:58,764
-What about yours?
-Well, let's see.

676
00:56:59,173 --> 00:57:01,937
My father's a sergeant.
His father was a sergeant.

677
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,238
He always wanted a son
who was an officer.

678
00:57:04,345 --> 00:57:06,404
Guess I'm just trying to get it half right.

679
00:57:06,514 --> 00:57:10,245
Yeah, but the real question is,
is this what makes you happy?

680
00:57:11,385 --> 00:57:13,819
Family makes me happy. Tradition.

681
00:57:13,921 --> 00:57:17,413
Tradition is something that keeps
greeting-card companies in business.

682
00:57:17,525 --> 00:57:21,518
I think at some point you gotta say,
''I'm gonna do what I wanna do, Dad.

683
00:57:21,629 --> 00:57:23,722
''So quit busting my balls.''

684
00:57:24,198 --> 00:57:27,497
Yeah, I'll be sure to mention that when
I have dinner with him this weekend.

685
00:57:27,602 --> 00:57:30,298
You might wanna leave out
the balls part.

686
00:57:31,205 --> 00:57:33,070
We should have a toast.

687
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,341
-To Coolidge.
-To you.

688
00:57:43,217 --> 00:57:44,411
To us.

689
00:57:54,295 --> 00:57:56,456
Shall I take you home?

690
00:57:56,564 --> 00:57:59,897
Actually, there's something
that I've heard about

691
00:58:00,001 --> 00:58:02,094
that I've been dying to see.

692
00:58:04,038 --> 00:58:06,029
My God, it's huge.

693
00:58:08,175 --> 00:58:10,735
Well, Farley and I both live here.

694
00:58:11,312 --> 00:58:12,745
Yu uses the hot tub.

695
00:58:12,847 --> 00:58:17,341
I think this is the bigger than some of
the military housing I grew up in.

696
00:58:18,352 --> 00:58:20,513
I think it's a lot like me.

697
00:58:20,621 --> 00:58:24,853
Simple yet elegant. Coarse but refined,

698
00:58:25,693 --> 00:58:28,753
and it could definitely use a woman's

699
00:58:30,197 --> 00:58:31,357
touch.

700
00:58:31,732 --> 00:58:33,962
I've always wanted to do that.

701
00:58:43,678 --> 00:58:45,976
The amputated leg strikes again.

702
00:58:47,281 --> 00:58:50,944
-Are your roommates around?
-I sent them to the movies.

703
00:58:51,052 --> 00:58:54,579
-So they'll be back soon.
-I sent them to all the movies.

704
00:58:55,022 --> 00:58:56,455
That's good.

705
00:58:56,557 --> 00:59:00,015
With Dirk, I always felt like someone
was gonna break down the door.

706
00:59:00,127 --> 00:59:01,492
Don't move!

707
00:59:02,663 --> 00:59:04,290
Search the place.

708
00:59:05,066 --> 00:59:07,125
Are you in some kind of trouble?

709
00:59:07,234 --> 00:59:11,796
Either that, or the library has seriously
changed its overdue-book policy.

710
00:59:11,906 --> 00:59:14,568
We got an anonymous tip
that there are some illegal narcotics

711
00:59:14,675 --> 00:59:17,041
being hidden in the plant thingy.

712
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,781
There's nothing in the bag.
It's empty, sir.

713
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:25,675
False alarm.

714
00:59:27,722 --> 00:59:29,952
You kids have a nice evening.

715
00:59:32,259 --> 00:59:34,887
Oh, and don't forget to wrap it up.

716
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,997
What just happened?

717
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:46,332
What wrong with Colossus?

718
00:59:47,541 --> 00:59:50,669
Damn, yo, that dog is mad blazed.

719
00:59:50,778 --> 00:59:53,076
He must've eaten a whole pound.

720
00:59:54,248 --> 00:59:58,947
Hey, don't be lookin' at me, man.
I keep my stuff right here.

721
01:00:01,255 --> 01:00:02,552
Hydroponic.

722
01:00:02,656 --> 01:00:04,988
You know,
messing with me is one thing,

723
01:00:05,092 --> 01:00:07,151
but nobody screws my pooch.

724
01:00:07,661 --> 01:00:09,390
It's Dirk. It's gotta be.

725
01:00:09,497 --> 01:00:12,489
He's trying to get even with me
for breaking up with him.

726
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,227
You two broke up?

727
01:00:14,668 --> 01:00:16,431
Sorry to hear that.

728
01:00:16,537 --> 01:00:19,165
I just can't believe he'd go this far.

729
01:00:20,608 --> 01:00:22,542
I don't think he did.

730
01:00:22,643 --> 01:00:26,443
I think old Dirky boy's playing
Vanna to someone else's Sajak.

731
01:00:27,281 --> 01:00:29,943
And now it's our turn to spin the wheel.

732
01:00:30,785 --> 01:00:32,844
What do you mean, he wasn't arrested?

733
01:00:32,953 --> 01:00:34,614
We didn't find any drugs.

734
01:00:34,722 --> 01:00:37,953
Officer, can you tell me why,
at such a fine institute

735
01:00:38,058 --> 01:00:41,152
of higher learning,
I'm surrounded by idiots?

736
01:00:41,662 --> 01:00:44,859
<i>-It's time for your massage, sir.
-Send them in.</i>

737
01:00:44,965 --> 01:00:47,126
Get out. You're incompetent.

738
01:00:53,207 --> 01:00:55,539
One? I usually have two girls.

739
01:00:57,077 --> 01:00:59,307
Me no disappoint.

740
01:01:02,049 --> 01:01:03,744
Holy Schwarzkopf.

741
01:01:04,585 --> 01:01:05,847
Oh, yeah.

742
01:01:14,195 --> 01:01:15,976
Hairy, hairy chest. I like it!

743
01:01:16,011 --> 01:01:17,758
Hairy, hairy chest. I like it!

744
01:01:17,865 --> 01:01:20,095
Hello. Is this Mrs. Reardon?

745
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:27,972
Big, strong Gl.

746
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:31,877
You know, you Charlie ain't so bad.

747
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:34,413
Shame we had to beat you in 'Nam.

748
01:01:38,385 --> 01:01:42,481
-You want happy ending?
-Does an Arab shit in the sand?

749
01:01:47,828 --> 01:01:52,231
-What's this?
-Not polite to watch, only to feel.

750
01:01:57,137 --> 01:01:59,867
Why your soldier not stand at attention?

751
01:02:00,541 --> 01:02:02,133
It will, it will.

752
01:02:10,918 --> 01:02:12,476
Very good.

753
01:02:20,461 --> 01:02:23,191
This is something you'll like very much!

754
01:02:23,797 --> 01:02:25,788
I cannot wait very much.

755
01:02:27,501 --> 01:02:28,468
Yeah.

756
01:02:29,169 --> 01:02:32,661
Your soldier stand at attention now.

757
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:36,366
-You likey, likey?
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

758
01:02:36,477 --> 01:02:40,538
-You ready for mouth massage?
-Bring it on.

759
01:02:41,782 --> 01:02:43,682
Here it come.

760
01:02:51,592 --> 01:02:53,583
Easy there, easy there.

761
01:02:54,595 --> 01:02:56,825
-Feel good?
-Watch it.

762
01:02:57,431 --> 01:02:58,728
Watch Huck and Buck, there.

763
01:02:58,832 --> 01:03:00,197
No touching.

764
01:03:02,937 --> 01:03:04,529
That feels good.

765
01:03:12,479 --> 01:03:14,276
That is so hot.

766
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:24,686
Charles!

767
01:03:36,303 --> 01:03:37,770
So dirty.

768
01:03:38,372 --> 01:03:42,069
I promise I will never make you
do anything like that ever again.

769
01:03:43,911 --> 01:03:48,939
Given the events of this afternoon,

770
01:03:49,817 --> 01:03:52,285
there is only one thing
in the world that I want.

771
01:03:52,386 --> 01:03:55,150
-A rabies shot, sir?
-No, God damn it!

772
01:03:55,255 --> 01:03:56,688
I want Wilder.

773
01:03:56,790 --> 01:04:00,157
He's turned my wife against me,
my school against me,

774
01:04:02,529 --> 01:04:04,895
he even turned my dog against me.

775
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,661
Wish we could just kick him out!

776
01:04:07,768 --> 01:04:10,669
There's gotta be some way
I could just force him to leave.

777
01:04:10,771 --> 01:04:15,071
Oh, I would love to see the look
on his dad's face

778
01:04:15,175 --> 01:04:16,904
when he finds out his son is expelled.

779
01:04:17,011 --> 01:04:19,673
I would love to see the look
on Kaitlin's dad's face

780
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:22,271
when he realizes
that his daughter's new boyfriend

781
01:04:22,383 --> 01:04:23,907
isn't joining the Army.

782
01:04:24,018 --> 01:04:26,111
Will you shut the hell...

783
01:04:28,222 --> 01:04:30,281
-Whose dad?
-Kaitlin's.

784
01:04:34,261 --> 01:04:35,159
Lieutenant! I've got it.

785
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:38,059
We are gonna finish Wilder.

786
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:41,623
-And your former squeeze, too.
-Yes, sir!

787
01:04:41,735 --> 01:04:44,898
In order to do that,
I have a very important mission for you.

788
01:04:45,005 --> 01:04:47,405
I need you to find me some skanks.

789
01:04:48,709 --> 01:04:51,769
Well, I'm sorry Kaitlin,
but it's your turn for guard duty.

790
01:04:51,879 --> 01:04:53,870
No more special treatment.

791
01:04:57,084 --> 01:04:59,882
Nothing personal, Corporal.
Just be there.

792
01:05:01,221 --> 01:05:04,748
It's set. You think you can get
your friends to go along?

793
01:05:05,859 --> 01:05:08,589
They'll do whatever I tell them to do.

794
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:09,924
Awesome.

795
01:05:10,731 --> 01:05:15,464
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God. Oh, Satan!

796
01:05:20,974 --> 01:05:23,602
What? What are you doing? Don't stop!

797
01:05:25,479 --> 01:05:26,878
Out of ammo.

798
01:05:28,982 --> 01:05:30,006
Hand me your gun!

799
01:05:37,491 --> 01:05:38,924
Ten-hut!

800
01:05:41,195 --> 01:05:42,856
I taught him that.

801
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:51,060
What's wrong?

802
01:05:52,406 --> 01:05:53,668
It's Dirk.

803
01:05:54,508 --> 01:05:56,499
He knew I was going to dinner tonight
with my father,

804
01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:59,704
and he deliberately
scheduled me for guard duty.

805
01:06:00,347 --> 01:06:01,712
So don't go.

806
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:05,575
Van, guard duty isn't something
you can just shrug off.

807
01:06:05,686 --> 01:06:09,452
If you miss it, or screw up,
it can ruin your career. It's serious.

808
01:06:09,556 --> 01:06:12,719
Which is exactly how the boys
and I will treat it.

809
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:16,863
-You're gonna do it?
-Hey, I know it's not toilets,

810
01:06:16,964 --> 01:06:19,057
but I think I can handle it.

811
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:23,426
What, don't you trust me?

812
01:06:24,171 --> 01:06:25,536
I trust you.

813
01:06:45,159 --> 01:06:48,526
But we have dates tonight! Hot ones!

814
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:49,823
Irving, trust me.

815
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:53,366
That sucking action is not realistic,
no matter what it says on the box.

816
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:57,403
I mean real dates this time, Van!
Hot ones.

817
01:06:57,971 --> 01:06:59,962
-Human females?
-Hot ones.

818
01:07:01,508 --> 01:07:03,339
Tell you what. They can come along.

819
01:07:03,443 --> 01:07:08,403
Yes! Up, up, down, down, left,
right, left, right, B, A, start!

820
01:07:09,383 --> 01:07:11,715
Now, what exactly are we guarding?

821
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:14,845
You will not get inside
Colonel Reardon's Humvee.

822
01:07:14,955 --> 01:07:19,585
You do not touch the Humvee.
You do not look at the Humvee.

823
01:07:20,093 --> 01:07:21,458
Then how are we supposed
to guard them?

824
01:07:21,562 --> 01:07:23,792
You do not look at the Humvee!

825
01:07:26,166 --> 01:07:27,190
Now,

826
01:07:29,069 --> 01:07:32,869
this guard duty better come out
smooth as a bran muffin shit,

827
01:07:33,907 --> 01:07:37,001
or somebody's gonna have their ass
handed to 'em.

828
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,772
Any questions?

829
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,678
Will you be the one
doing the ass handling?

830
01:07:45,986 --> 01:07:49,217
Don't worry, Wilder. Yours is coming.

831
01:07:54,494 --> 01:07:57,122
I am really starting to like that guy.

832
01:08:04,905 --> 01:08:09,569
-So, how's college?
-It's great.

833
01:08:09,676 --> 01:08:13,168
I'm taking a lot of interesting courses.
Military history, psychology...

834
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,680
You know, Dirk called me the other day.

835
01:08:15,782 --> 01:08:18,080
Said you had broken up with him.

836
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,550
Yeah, well,

837
01:08:21,788 --> 01:08:23,585
I met somebody else.

838
01:08:24,992 --> 01:08:26,516
He a military man?

839
01:08:26,627 --> 01:08:29,960
He respects the military.

840
01:08:32,933 --> 01:08:34,127
Ladies.

841
01:08:35,035 --> 01:08:38,334
Irving! You invited the ''dick'' girls?

842
01:08:39,106 --> 01:08:41,074
This is a bad idea.

843
01:08:41,174 --> 01:08:43,267
Van, don't be such a dork.

844
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:47,037
Howdy, heathen.

845
01:08:51,184 --> 01:08:52,913
Well, honey, with school and Dirk,

846
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:55,284
and everything that's been
going on around here,

847
01:08:55,389 --> 01:08:57,789
I just wanna know one thing. Are you...

848
01:08:57,891 --> 01:09:00,382
-Yes, Dad. I'm happy.
-That's great.

849
01:09:01,028 --> 01:09:04,486
But are you still on track
for officer training school?

850
01:09:09,703 --> 01:09:11,068
Listen, guys.

851
01:09:11,171 --> 01:09:14,163
Maybe we should slow down
just a little bit.

852
01:09:14,274 --> 01:09:17,607
I am Mars, god of war!

853
01:09:17,711 --> 01:09:21,340
Who amongst you shall engage
in body shots?

854
01:09:24,518 --> 01:09:27,749
Hey, soldier! Wanna fuck?

855
01:09:31,391 --> 01:09:33,018
No. Thank you.

856
01:09:33,126 --> 01:09:34,559
I do anal.

857
01:09:37,998 --> 01:09:41,161
Corporal Hayes.
As you were, as you were.

858
01:09:41,268 --> 01:09:43,532
I was on the other side
of the restaurant. I didn't see you.

859
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:45,662
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

860
01:09:45,772 --> 01:09:47,763
The pleasure's all mine, Sergeant.
I didn't realize Miss Hayes

861
01:09:47,874 --> 01:09:49,842
came from such good stock.

862
01:09:50,477 --> 01:09:54,345
Well, hopefully she will climb
a bit higher up the ladder than I did, sir.

863
01:09:54,448 --> 01:09:57,781
I have no doubt, Sergeant.
Kaitlin is officer material all the way.

864
01:09:57,884 --> 01:09:59,613
Her record is flawless.

865
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,745
Say, you're about done here.
I was just heading back to the base.

866
01:10:01,855 --> 01:10:05,416
Would you like a tour? You could see
your daughter's unit in action.

867
01:10:05,525 --> 01:10:07,083
I don't think that's such a good idea.

868
01:10:07,194 --> 01:10:09,321
-I'd love to, sir.
-Dad!

869
01:10:09,963 --> 01:10:12,261
I'm really proud of you. Love to see it.

870
01:10:12,366 --> 01:10:13,958
Come on. Show off for your old man.
Let's go.

871
01:10:14,067 --> 01:10:15,432
-Please?
-Okay.

872
01:10:15,535 --> 01:10:18,333
-You're gonna enjoy this.
-Thank you, sir.

873
01:10:20,707 --> 01:10:23,267
Oh, you know what? I forgot my purse,
so I'll meet you outside, okay?

874
01:10:23,377 --> 01:10:24,969
-All right.
-Okay.

875
01:10:26,913 --> 01:10:28,710
You know what I wanna do to you?

876
01:10:28,815 --> 01:10:30,874
Leave me alone permanently?

877
01:10:31,351 --> 01:10:34,218
Hey, watch that! Hey, stop... Hey!

878
01:10:34,688 --> 01:10:36,053
No means no.

879
01:10:46,767 --> 01:10:48,860
Come on, Van. Pick up.

880
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:53,604
Miss Hayes.

881
01:10:54,307 --> 01:10:55,604
Shall we?

882
01:11:11,725 --> 01:11:14,990
You're about to be very proud
about what you'll see.

883
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:23,032
What in God's name...

884
01:11:25,272 --> 01:11:28,400
Kaitlin, this is your unit?

885
01:11:29,509 --> 01:11:31,340
For the last time, no!

886
01:11:31,912 --> 01:11:33,072
Van?

887
01:11:36,383 --> 01:11:38,578
You must be Kaitlin's father.

888
01:11:39,786 --> 01:11:43,552
Corporal Hayes, I thought you were
a better leader than this.

889
01:11:43,657 --> 01:11:46,251
I thought you were officer material.

890
01:11:46,359 --> 01:11:48,589
Do you understand
what the consequences of this will be?

891
01:11:48,695 --> 01:11:50,754
-Colonel Reardon, I...
-She will accept

892
01:11:50,864 --> 01:11:53,697
any punishment you deem fit, sir.

893
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,096
Wait. I can explain.

894
01:11:56,703 --> 01:11:58,637
Kaitlin, let me explain.

895
01:12:00,574 --> 01:12:03,134
-That a boy, Dirk.
-My pleasure, sir.

896
01:12:03,677 --> 01:12:05,372
Let's go, Kaitlin.

897
01:12:06,713 --> 01:12:07,737
Now.

898
01:12:08,348 --> 01:12:10,009
You're disgusting.

899
01:12:13,019 --> 01:12:14,247
Call me.

900
01:12:18,825 --> 01:12:22,192
You realize it's my duty
to make a report of this.

901
01:12:22,295 --> 01:12:26,026
Gonna put a pretty big stain
on her pretty little record.

902
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:29,227
But it's about time you learn there are
some people you don't fuck with.

903
01:12:29,336 --> 01:12:31,133
What do you want from me?

904
01:12:31,238 --> 01:12:34,332
Isn't it obvious?
I want you gone, out, quit.

905
01:12:34,741 --> 01:12:37,608
Running home to Daddy
with your tail between your legs.

906
01:12:37,711 --> 01:12:39,338
What if I say no?

907
01:12:39,446 --> 01:12:41,880
Well, then I guess Miss Hayes'
military career will be coming

908
01:12:41,982 --> 01:12:44,576
to a rather premature and ignoble end.

909
01:12:46,086 --> 01:12:47,417
Tell you what.

910
01:12:47,521 --> 01:12:49,250
Having some people over
for dinner tomorrow night

911
01:12:49,356 --> 01:12:51,153
to discuss our annual war games.

912
01:12:51,258 --> 01:12:53,453
Why don't you give me
your decision then?

913
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,152
Good seeing you.

914
01:14:39,132 --> 01:14:40,929
A Wilder never quits.

915
01:14:42,002 --> 01:14:44,698
So I said, ''I've got some
affirmative action for you.

916
01:14:44,804 --> 01:14:46,738
''I can affirm that your dumbass kid
won't be getting

917
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,865
''any action at my school.''

918
01:14:50,944 --> 01:14:51,933
Yo!

919
01:14:52,445 --> 01:14:53,912
Cap'n Crunch!

920
01:14:55,849 --> 01:14:57,680
I've made my decision.

921
01:14:57,784 --> 01:15:00,719
I've decided we should settle this,
once and for all.

922
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:04,381
Like men. No more sneaking,
no more backstabbing.

923
01:15:04,491 --> 01:15:07,483
Let's just get it all right out in the open.

924
01:15:08,628 --> 01:15:10,289
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

925
01:15:10,397 --> 01:15:13,161
You've got a problem with my father,

926
01:15:13,266 --> 01:15:16,360
a problem with my name,
and that's too bad.

927
01:15:16,836 --> 01:15:20,272
But I'll be damned
if I'm gonna sit around and let you

928
01:15:20,373 --> 01:15:24,241
and your little peons
flush this school down the toilet

929
01:15:24,344 --> 01:15:25,834
and hurt the people I care about,

930
01:15:25,945 --> 01:15:28,436
because, even though you dragged her
into this,

931
01:15:28,548 --> 01:15:31,642
this has never really been
about Kaitlin, who,

932
01:15:31,751 --> 01:15:35,983
on her worst day, will be a better officer
than you ever were.

933
01:15:37,424 --> 01:15:41,827
That girI's got bigger balls than you, me,
and my freakish dog combined.

934
01:15:42,762 --> 01:15:47,563
I have had enough
of these little games, Wilder.

935
01:15:47,667 --> 01:15:48,861
Get out.

936
01:15:49,636 --> 01:15:50,898
Games?

937
01:15:52,038 --> 01:15:53,665
You wanna play games?

938
01:15:53,773 --> 01:15:56,970
How about
one of your precious little war games?

939
01:15:58,178 --> 01:16:01,045
Loser leaves Coolidge. For good.

940
01:16:01,481 --> 01:16:03,642
What do you think about that?

941
01:16:04,384 --> 01:16:08,252
I think you're in
for an old-fashioned ass-kicking, son.

942
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:11,085
If I was your son, I'd kick my own ass.

943
01:16:17,831 --> 01:16:19,128
I'm sorry.

944
01:16:24,471 --> 01:16:27,065
You're finished, Wilder. Finished.

945
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:32,170
Miss Hayes,
in light of Mr. Wilder's behavior

946
01:16:32,278 --> 01:16:35,441
I am going to remove
last night's incident from your record,

947
01:16:35,548 --> 01:16:39,177
and I am giving you
my official recommendation

948
01:16:39,285 --> 01:16:41,310
for officer training school.

949
01:16:41,421 --> 01:16:42,911
Thank you, sir.

950
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:46,058
But I'm afraid I'll have to decline.

951
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:48,320
The officer training school
only accepts those who have

952
01:16:48,428 --> 01:16:50,521
received the most honorable training.

953
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:54,225
Your name on my recommendation
would render me ineligible.

954
01:16:56,002 --> 01:16:58,630
In other words, sir, go fuck yourself!

955
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:08,711
Kaitlin!

956
01:17:11,951 --> 01:17:13,179
Kaitlin.

957
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:16,518
I blew it, Dad. I'm so sorry.

958
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:22,455
-He's right.
-What?

959
01:17:22,829 --> 01:17:25,662
Kaitlin, I wanted you to be a soldier.

960
01:17:26,065 --> 01:17:27,362
I still do.

961
01:17:28,268 --> 01:17:30,532
But if getting there means having
to march in a line that's crooked,

962
01:17:30,637 --> 01:17:32,696
then it ain't worth a damn.

963
01:17:34,073 --> 01:17:37,509
You don't join the Army to follow.
You join it to lead.

964
01:17:38,144 --> 01:17:41,204
And the only way to lead
is to do what's right.

965
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:45,908
That's my girl.

966
01:17:48,988 --> 01:17:50,819
None of this is gonna work.

967
01:17:50,924 --> 01:17:53,893
We need a man who actually knows
what the hell he's doing.

968
01:17:53,993 --> 01:17:55,620
How about a woman?

969
01:18:03,336 --> 01:18:06,703
Kaitlin, I swear to God,
I never touched her.

970
01:18:07,841 --> 01:18:10,139
Okay? It was man rape.

971
01:18:11,177 --> 01:18:13,907
Save it. I only wanna know one thing.

972
01:18:15,882 --> 01:18:18,817
Are you ready to enter an alliance,
neighbor?

973
01:18:24,958 --> 01:18:26,687
It seems he is.

974
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:29,557
Okay, enough of the soft stuff.

975
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:32,798
Reardon's got us outnumbered
five to one,

976
01:18:32,899 --> 01:18:35,732
so there's no way
we can take him head on.

977
01:18:35,835 --> 01:18:37,666
We're gonna fight him
on our own terms.

978
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:39,328
What do we do?

979
01:18:39,439 --> 01:18:43,068
We do the only thing you guys
know how to do. We have fun.

980
01:18:47,213 --> 01:18:50,740
Anyone who loses an armband
will be considered captured.

981
01:18:51,150 --> 01:18:53,744
Whoever captures
the other team's general wins.

982
01:18:53,853 --> 01:18:56,549
Reardon's Raiders, who's your general?

983
01:18:56,656 --> 01:18:58,988
Charles Stonewall Reardon, sir!

984
01:18:59,092 --> 01:19:01,652
Your team will wear the yellow bands.

985
01:19:01,961 --> 01:19:04,395
Team Maverick, who's your general?

986
01:19:06,833 --> 01:19:08,425
That would be me.

987
01:19:10,503 --> 01:19:13,301
How's it hanging, Chuck? You miss me?

988
01:19:15,808 --> 01:19:16,934
Hey.

989
01:19:18,444 --> 01:19:21,004
Your team will wear the orange bands.

990
01:19:21,881 --> 01:19:24,543
The game begins
when you hear the siren.

991
01:19:25,985 --> 01:19:28,351
I hope you're prepared, gentlemen.

992
01:19:28,454 --> 01:19:30,513
Someone's going home today.

993
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:37,789
All right, let's listen up.
First squad, take the left flank,

994
01:19:37,897 --> 01:19:41,765
past the lake. Second squad, right flank.

995
01:19:42,502 --> 01:19:44,527
Third squad, head on.

996
01:19:45,538 --> 01:19:47,301
And our recon team,

997
01:19:47,941 --> 01:19:50,842
well, let's just say
they have a head start.

998
01:19:51,277 --> 01:19:52,710
Lieutenant Arnold will stay with me.

999
01:19:52,812 --> 01:19:55,110
Corporal Benedict,
you'll guard the Humvee.

1000
01:19:55,214 --> 01:19:56,681
All right, men, there's the siren.

1001
01:19:56,783 --> 01:19:58,444
Now, let's get these bastards!

1002
01:19:58,551 --> 01:20:00,178
-Raiders!
-Raiders!

1003
01:20:01,988 --> 01:20:04,183
Colonel, we got recon
on the radio for you.

1004
01:20:04,290 --> 01:20:06,656
Recon, report. Can you see their base?

1005
01:20:06,759 --> 01:20:08,852
-I have a visual, sir.
-What's going on?

1006
01:20:08,962 --> 01:20:11,328
-Shots, sir.
-Jesus Christ, they're firing at us?

1007
01:20:11,431 --> 01:20:13,661
<i>No, sir. Jell-O shots.</i>

1008
01:20:13,766 --> 01:20:16,030
<i>I repeat, Jell-O shots.
They've got the blast!</i>

1009
01:20:16,135 --> 01:20:18,535
-They've got explosives?
-No, sir.

1010
01:20:18,638 --> 01:20:22,540
The Jell-O shots with a blueberry blast.
It's my favorite, sir.

1011
01:20:23,242 --> 01:20:24,209
What the hell's he talking about?

1012
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:25,334
Sounds like they're having a goddamn...

1013
01:20:25,445 --> 01:20:28,437
Party!

1014
01:20:38,424 --> 01:20:41,052
So, where did all this sand come from?

1015
01:20:41,661 --> 01:20:43,959
Thank Sheik Mohammad.

1016
01:20:45,465 --> 01:20:46,489
Who?

1017
01:20:51,237 --> 01:20:53,034
-How we doing?
-We're up.

1018
01:20:53,139 --> 01:20:55,073
Give Reardon the feed.

1019
01:20:57,610 --> 01:20:59,043
Recon report.

1020
01:20:59,412 --> 01:21:01,812
Sir. Something's happening
with the monitor.

1021
01:21:01,914 --> 01:21:03,472
<i>Testing, testing, check, check, hello.</i>

1022
01:21:03,583 --> 01:21:06,746
<i>I'm sorry, they can't come
to the phone right now.</i>

1023
01:21:07,253 --> 01:21:08,481
<i>Would you like to leave a message?</i>

1024
01:21:08,588 --> 01:21:11,113
How the hell did you eliminate my men?

1025
01:21:11,224 --> 01:21:14,751
<i>Chuck, "eliminate" is such an ugly word.</i>

1026
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:17,596
<i>Van Wilder rules!</i>

1027
01:21:23,936 --> 01:21:26,029
You tell first squad to move in.

1028
01:21:26,139 --> 01:21:29,006
And have Benedict on standby
with my Humvee.

1029
01:21:29,108 --> 01:21:30,803
<i>Corporal Benedict!</i>

1030
01:21:33,513 --> 01:21:34,741
Yes, sir!

1031
01:21:34,847 --> 01:21:36,508
<i>Stand by for deployment.</i>

1032
01:21:36,616 --> 01:21:37,742
Yes, sir.

1033
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:40,011
You heard him!
Stand by for deployment!

1034
01:21:40,119 --> 01:21:41,347
That way!

1035
01:21:53,733 --> 01:21:55,132
Hey, guys!

1036
01:21:58,304 --> 01:22:00,169
Come skinny-dipping!

1037
01:22:06,312 --> 01:22:07,609
What the hell?

1038
01:22:09,716 --> 01:22:12,082
I seen this in a porno once.

1039
01:22:12,952 --> 01:22:15,216
-Have you seen this before?
-Don't be scared.

1040
01:22:15,321 --> 01:22:16,788
Jump in, baby.

1041
01:22:23,596 --> 01:22:24,961
Wait for me!

1042
01:22:42,381 --> 01:22:44,941
First squad, report! Report, damn it!

1043
01:22:46,586 --> 01:22:49,953
Sorry about your troops, Chuck,
but they decided to make love,

1044
01:22:50,056 --> 01:22:51,250
not war.

1045
01:22:55,461 --> 01:22:56,951
Son of a bitch.

1046
01:22:58,598 --> 01:22:59,929
<i>Gotta conga.</i>

1047
01:23:13,179 --> 01:23:14,339
Hello!

1048
01:23:14,881 --> 01:23:19,113
-Sir, we found their general.
-I hooked myself into a sand trap.

1049
01:23:19,519 --> 01:23:23,046
Well, don't just stand there,
capture him, you jackass!

1050
01:23:23,156 --> 01:23:24,384
Grab him!

1051
01:23:28,895 --> 01:23:31,090
Give me the armband, General.

1052
01:23:32,031 --> 01:23:34,226
I told you it was a sand trap.

1053
01:23:38,004 --> 01:23:39,164
Ladies.

1054
01:23:46,445 --> 01:23:47,935
I still got it.

1055
01:23:48,648 --> 01:23:50,707
Well, did they get him?

1056
01:23:51,317 --> 01:23:52,682
Not exactly.

1057
01:23:58,991 --> 01:24:01,152
-Permission to get angry, sir.
-Denied.

1058
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:02,557
Denied!

1059
01:24:15,474 --> 01:24:17,533
Wet your whistle?

1060
01:24:19,812 --> 01:24:23,009
Where the hell is third squad?
They should've been there by now.

1061
01:24:23,115 --> 01:24:27,518
<i>Hey, Chuck! I just wanna let you know,
third squad took a little detour.</i>

1062
01:24:33,693 --> 01:24:35,661
God damn you, Wilder!

1063
01:24:37,930 --> 01:24:39,227
Well, what are you doing
just standing there?

1064
01:24:39,332 --> 01:24:42,130
Why don't you pussies get out there
and get me Van Wilder?

1065
01:24:42,235 --> 01:24:44,362
-Go!
-Get out there! Move! Move!

1066
01:24:52,011 --> 01:24:54,241
I can't feel my hair anymore, man.

1067
01:24:54,347 --> 01:24:56,281
That means it's working.

1068
01:25:00,253 --> 01:25:03,120
I wouldn't go any farther if I were you.

1069
01:25:03,222 --> 01:25:05,520
Yeah, who's gonna stop us? You?

1070
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:12,324
Exactly.

1071
01:25:28,114 --> 01:25:29,979
Is that all you've got?

1072
01:26:03,683 --> 01:26:05,947
-I'll go after them, sir.
-No!

1073
01:26:06,052 --> 01:26:07,883
Get me Corporal Benedict.

1074
01:26:07,987 --> 01:26:10,956
We'll take the Humvee
and run right over 'em.

1075
01:26:13,192 --> 01:26:14,750
You're a genius.

1076
01:26:15,194 --> 01:26:16,821
Corporal Benedict.

1077
01:26:18,164 --> 01:26:19,791
<i>Corporal Benedict!</i>

1078
01:26:21,033 --> 01:26:24,161
Dirk, have I ever told you
I love you, man?

1079
01:26:24,270 --> 01:26:27,034
We all love you. Yeah!

1080
01:26:27,139 --> 01:26:29,232
<i>-What?
-It's so soft, sir.</i>

1081
01:26:29,342 --> 01:26:31,776
Have you felt the helmets?

1082
01:26:33,212 --> 01:26:35,772
Rub your helmet with me, it's so soft.

1083
01:26:36,282 --> 01:26:38,341
You fucking fruitcake!

1084
01:26:41,654 --> 01:26:44,350
-What was that?
-Don't ask, don't tell.

1085
01:26:46,092 --> 01:26:50,426
<i>Okay, Chuck. We got your boys.
Why don't you and little Dirky</i>

1086
01:26:50,529 --> 01:26:51,791
<i>surrender and join the party?</i>

1087
01:26:51,897 --> 01:26:55,333
Never. Surrender? Surrender?

1088
01:26:56,235 --> 01:26:58,328
I'd rather see my uncle naked again.

1089
01:27:05,678 --> 01:27:07,043
It was an accident.

1090
01:27:07,146 --> 01:27:10,411
<i>If you want me, Wilder,
you have to come and get me.</i>

1091
01:27:11,917 --> 01:27:13,782
-Shall we?
-Let's.

1092
01:27:16,489 --> 01:27:20,084
Get out there and stop them! Now! Go!

1093
01:27:20,626 --> 01:27:22,560
He's a little pissant!

1094
01:27:24,597 --> 01:27:25,962
Let me go with you.

1095
01:27:26,065 --> 01:27:29,899
Sorry, Dad, but this is one fight
I need to finish on my own.

1096
01:27:33,572 --> 01:27:35,802
-Go get him.
-Let's do it.

1097
01:27:49,255 --> 01:27:50,244
There's the base!

1098
01:27:56,262 --> 01:27:57,524
Kaitlin.

1099
01:27:58,798 --> 01:28:00,891
I knew you'd come back for me.

1100
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,798
What do you say? I go high, you go low?

1101
01:28:03,903 --> 01:28:07,498
No. This asshole's all mine. Go.

1102
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:10,399
-You sure?
-Yep, I got it.

1103
01:28:16,549 --> 01:28:18,483
Come to papa, honeybear.

1104
01:28:23,189 --> 01:28:24,781
You got nothin'.

1105
01:28:28,894 --> 01:28:31,863
-I could do this all day.
-That'd be a first.

1106
01:28:32,364 --> 01:28:36,266
Your hair smells really nice.
What is that, Essence of Traitor?

1107
01:28:45,177 --> 01:28:46,940
-Not so fast.
-Chuck.

1108
01:28:47,913 --> 01:28:49,073
Get up.

1109
01:28:51,083 --> 01:28:52,345
Hot stuff.

1110
01:28:53,919 --> 01:28:55,443
You smell good.

1111
01:28:55,955 --> 01:28:58,685
Wish you fought this hard
in the bedroom.

1112
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,457
See, this is why women will never
make it in the military.

1113
01:29:05,564 --> 01:29:07,964
You got nothing between your legs.

1114
01:29:09,602 --> 01:29:10,569
Shit!

1115
01:29:13,339 --> 01:29:16,331
Yeah? Well, that makes two of us,
honeybear.

1116
01:29:22,114 --> 01:29:23,513
Nice BB gun.

1117
01:29:23,782 --> 01:29:26,148
I got one just like it at home.

1118
01:29:28,154 --> 01:29:29,246
Maybe not.

1119
01:29:29,355 --> 01:29:31,983
Let me tell you what's wrong
with you Wilders.

1120
01:29:32,091 --> 01:29:36,152
You think you can change the world
just because people like you.

1121
01:29:36,262 --> 01:29:39,663
Well, here's a tip, son,
people are like cockroaches.

1122
01:29:40,099 --> 01:29:42,863
You crush a few, the rest will scatter.

1123
01:29:46,605 --> 01:29:48,037
-I'm sorry, what? I was texting.
-Funny.

1124
01:29:48,072 --> 01:29:49,469
-I'm sorry, what? I was texting.
-Funny.

1125
01:29:50,476 --> 01:29:52,307
But the last laugh is mine.

1126
01:29:58,384 --> 01:29:59,874
God damn dog!

1127
01:30:04,089 --> 01:30:07,115
Like I said, nobody screws my pooch.

1128
01:30:09,094 --> 01:30:10,152
Sit!

1129
01:30:11,330 --> 01:30:12,592
Good boy.

1130
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,266
Orange team wins!

1131
01:30:27,112 --> 01:30:29,580
Wilder, this isn't over.

1132
01:30:29,682 --> 01:30:32,207
And if you think I'm quitting,
you are screwed in the head.

1133
01:30:32,318 --> 01:30:36,721
Hey! Listen up! I am doubling security!

1134
01:30:37,056 --> 01:30:38,751
And I am rewriting the rule book!

1135
01:30:38,857 --> 01:30:42,190
I'm gonna make the old Coolidge
look like Candy Land!

1136
01:30:43,195 --> 01:30:45,026
And you can't stop me.

1137
01:30:45,497 --> 01:30:47,465
No. But he can.

1138
01:30:50,703 --> 01:30:52,728
Thomas, what the hell are you doing?
You can't side with him.

1139
01:30:52,838 --> 01:30:55,864
-He's not one of us.
-You made your bed, soldier.

1140
01:30:55,975 --> 01:30:59,035
Now you're gonna have
to sleep in it. Officer!

1141
01:30:59,812 --> 01:31:01,803
-Get him out of here.
-Hey, I'm not going anywhere.

1142
01:31:01,914 --> 01:31:03,677
Remember who stamps your paycheck.

1143
01:31:03,782 --> 01:31:06,615
-Are you resisting arrest?
-You're damned right I am!

1144
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:08,016
Thank you.

1145
01:31:11,190 --> 01:31:13,988
This is for putting up with your bullshit.

1146
01:31:14,693 --> 01:31:15,955
And this

1147
01:31:17,763 --> 01:31:20,197
is for denying my kid's admission.

1148
01:31:20,799 --> 01:31:23,461
How affirmative is that action, bitch?

1149
01:31:31,343 --> 01:31:36,246
Corporal, those were about some of the
most outrageous tactics I've ever seen.

1150
01:31:36,348 --> 01:31:38,441
I'll be sure to note that
in my recommendation

1151
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:40,643
for officer training school.

1152
01:31:46,125 --> 01:31:48,059
Now, if you'll excuse me,

1153
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:50,954
I believe I'll engage in a body shot.

1154
01:31:56,201 --> 01:31:57,998
I'm proud of you, Son.

1155
01:31:58,337 --> 01:31:59,827
-Hey.
-Hey.

1156
01:31:59,938 --> 01:32:03,874
Van, I'd like you to meet
Stephen Walker, my head of security.

1157
01:32:06,312 --> 01:32:10,442
Mr. Wilder, I'm hereby tendering
my resignation for this assignment.

1158
01:32:11,016 --> 01:32:11,983
Very good.

1159
01:32:12,117 --> 01:32:14,745
It's been the utmost pleasure
working with you, sir.

1160
01:32:14,853 --> 01:32:17,321
-Yeah.
-Great work, Steve.

1161
01:32:17,723 --> 01:32:20,851
I'll see you back
at the office, all right? Good.

1162
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:25,226
-Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
-Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1163
01:32:26,865 --> 01:32:28,264
Yeah!

1164
01:32:28,867 --> 01:32:31,665
-So, what do you think?
-About what?

1165
01:32:31,770 --> 01:32:35,866
Oh, I think you've proven yourself here.
Wanna come to work with me?

1166
01:32:35,974 --> 01:32:39,034
Actually, I've been giving it
a lot of thought,

1167
01:32:39,144 --> 01:32:41,237
and I've decided to stay in school.

1168
01:32:41,347 --> 01:32:44,145
A smart man once told me that tradition

1169
01:32:44,249 --> 01:32:46,649
is something you just don't break.

1170
01:32:48,821 --> 01:32:50,379
Write that down.

1171
01:32:51,156 --> 01:32:52,418
Let's go.

1172
01:33:00,866 --> 01:33:04,495
-So, you wanna get out of here?
-And miss the party?

1173
01:33:05,804 --> 01:33:07,032
Trust me.

1174
01:33:08,507 --> 01:33:10,134
There'll be more.

1175
01:33:16,448 --> 01:33:19,076
Wait, where's that batti boy, Dirk?

1176
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:25,986
Sir, I don't mean to alarm you,
but something's about to come up.

1177
01:33:26,091 --> 01:33:28,286
What do you mean, something's about...

1178
01:33:28,394 --> 01:33:30,225
-Stand down, Corporal!
-I can't.

1179
01:33:30,329 --> 01:33:31,557
Stand...

1180
01:33:44,376 --> 01:33:47,004
Remember when I said the best things
in life are worth waiting for?

1181
01:33:47,112 --> 01:33:49,808
-Yeah.
-I think I've waited long enough.

1182
01:33:50,282 --> 01:33:51,374
Van!

1183
01:33:53,485 --> 01:33:56,454
Van, what are you doing? Put that away.

1184
01:33:57,990 --> 01:34:00,151
You're insane. Not here.

1185
01:34:25,984 --> 01:34:27,713
Now, all this stuff

1186
01:34:28,053 --> 01:34:30,385
you've heard about Coolidge
not wanting to party

1187
01:34:30,489 --> 01:34:31,888
is a lot of doggy dung.

1188
01:34:31,990 --> 01:34:33,821
-Stand down.
-I can't.

1189
01:34:33,926 --> 01:34:35,621
I'm flanking your ass.

1190
01:34:41,166 --> 01:34:42,497
Do you have any poison?

1191
01:34:42,601 --> 01:34:44,398
-You're tearing it.
-Oh, my God.

1192
01:34:44,503 --> 01:34:46,403
I'm gonna need stitches.

1193
01:34:46,505 --> 01:34:48,700
With some testosterone-pumping,

1194
01:34:48,807 --> 01:34:54,302
pituitary-fucking Neanderthal,
well, then, they are 100...

1195
01:34:54,713 --> 01:34:55,907
Fuck me.

1196
01:34:56,849 --> 01:34:58,646
Fuck, that scared me!

1197
01:34:59,718 --> 01:35:02,050
-Let's fuck!
-That's weird. Okay.

1198
01:35:02,855 --> 01:35:05,289
<i>Take her shirt off, grab the boob.</i>

1199
01:35:10,762 --> 01:35:11,820
<i>Cut!</i>

1200
01:35:14,333 --> 01:35:16,233
It's a challenge to...

1201
01:35:16,468 --> 01:35:19,232
Now, I'm not saying
this is gonna be easy.

1202
01:35:19,771 --> 01:35:23,605
Some of us may fall,
so that all of us may ball.

1203
01:35:24,076 --> 01:35:27,603
Oh, easy there, easy.
Those are big, old colonel balls, honey.

1204
01:35:27,713 --> 01:35:29,908
This a new experience for you?

1205
01:35:30,682 --> 01:35:34,118
Yeah. I usually use my old balls.

1206
01:35:34,853 --> 01:35:37,344
Big old, colonel,
big, round, colonel balls.

1207
01:35:37,456 --> 01:35:42,189
Hey, when I'm off camera,
I'm just gonna show 'em my old balls!

1208
01:35:42,394 --> 01:35:45,591
You gotta admit, though,
this is kind of romantic.

1209
01:35:47,099 --> 01:35:51,001
Hey, watch those teeth.
Or take 'em out before you do anything.

1210
01:35:51,670 --> 01:35:53,695
Who's my big, bad boy?

1211
01:35:56,141 --> 01:35:58,268
-I'm your big, bad boy.
-There you go.

1212
01:35:58,377 --> 01:36:02,108
Oh, God. I haven't been this
uncomfortable since Catholic school.

1213
01:36:02,214 --> 01:36:04,239
''Feel good, yeah?'' Feels good.

1214
01:36:04,349 --> 01:36:06,374
That's how you'd say it,
but I say ''feels good.''

1215
01:36:09,922 --> 01:36:12,482
You know my spot, Lieutenant.

1216
01:36:12,925 --> 01:36:16,019
Holy shit! That thing pops!

1217
01:36:16,228 --> 01:36:17,889
College is a team.

1218
01:36:18,263 --> 01:36:22,563
It lives, eats, drinks, and if you're lucky,
humps, as a team.

1219
01:36:24,102 --> 01:36:26,969
I love the smell of gasoline
in the morning.

1220
01:36:27,272 --> 01:36:28,705
Yummy, yum, yeah.

1221
01:36:29,141 --> 01:36:30,631
You wanna go back to my house
and eat some yogurt

1222
01:36:30,742 --> 01:36:32,607
<i>and watch Mean Girls?</i>

1223
01:36:32,711 --> 01:36:34,645
<i>Yeah, Mean Girls is all right,
but the guy in it sucks.</i>

1224
01:36:34,746 --> 01:36:35,974
I think he's dreamy.

1225
01:36:36,081 --> 01:36:38,072
He scheduled me for guard duty.

1226
01:36:39,017 --> 01:36:40,416
What?

1227
01:36:40,519 --> 01:36:43,181
So, you wanna go back
to my house, grab a bottle of shiraz

1228
01:36:43,288 --> 01:36:47,088
<i>-and maybe flip on The Hills?
-No. I hate those bitches.</i>

1229
01:36:47,559 --> 01:36:50,528
He knew I was going to dinner
tonight with...

1230
01:36:51,897 --> 01:36:54,331
I think Brody Jenner's your competition
for Jaw Line of the Year.

1231
01:36:54,433 --> 01:36:56,731
I just... I'm gonna jerk off right here.
Pull it out,

1232
01:36:56,835 --> 01:36:58,564
and just jerk off right in front of you.
Is that okay?

1233
01:36:58,670 --> 01:37:01,662
You lick my dick 'cause you like taste.

1234
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:03,468
Turn around, turn around.

1235
01:37:03,575 --> 01:37:05,736
You motherfucker, asshole dick-licker!

1236
01:37:05,844 --> 01:37:08,039
<i>I've got 13 Going on 30.</i>

1237
01:37:08,146 --> 01:37:09,545
I've seen it. I'll watch it again.

1238
01:37:09,648 --> 01:37:11,377
-Ruffalo's bomb.
-Yeah, he's awesome in that.

1239
01:37:11,717 --> 01:37:12,979
You asshole dick-licker!

1240
01:37:13,085 --> 01:37:16,282
Could be like this. You and me always.

1241
01:37:17,756 --> 01:37:19,747
What do you say, once we get loose,
we find a little pup tent

1242
01:37:19,858 --> 01:37:21,587
and fuck for a week?

1243
01:37:21,994 --> 01:37:24,360
Robert Levy's not paying me
enough to show my penis.

1244
01:37:24,463 --> 01:37:26,988
-Is that sweat?
-No, that's pre-cum.

1245
01:37:27,566 --> 01:37:30,535
You gotta eat dirt
before you drink champagne.

1246
01:37:31,036 --> 01:37:33,504
Sometimes you have got to stand up
as a man

1247
01:37:33,605 --> 01:37:35,334
before you can lie down with a woman.

1248
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,499
You gotta get your guard on
before your hard-on.

1249
01:37:38,744 --> 01:37:41,338
Nothing? You know... Hold on a second.

1250
01:37:42,547 --> 01:37:43,809

1252
01:37:45,917 --> 01:37:47,214

1253
01:38:22,487 --> 01:38:24,079
Hand me your gun.

1254
01:38:26,825 --> 01:38:29,658
I can't quit you.
