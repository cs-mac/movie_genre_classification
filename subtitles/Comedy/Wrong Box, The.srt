Memo To: Martin Teague
Deputy Director OF NSA

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,000
Resuscitation of the patient,
Arlington James Steward,

4
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,400
has been confirmed
by hospital staff.

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,840
On July 24, he was transferred
from the burn treatment unit

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,700
to an undisclosed location.

7
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,900
He has built a device
with an unknown purpose.

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,380
Design specifications has been
approved by the Mars Project.

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,740
The patient has returned to
his residence with the device.

10
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,700
There are no further details.

11
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,540
You hear something?

12
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,620
It's the doorbell.

13
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,500
Are you sure?

14
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,940
What time is it?

15
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,140
Quarter to 6.

16
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,100
- What is it?
- Someone left a box.

17
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,460
Who?

18
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,580
I don't know. There was a car
and they just drove off.

19
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,220
Did Santa come early this year?

20
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,220
I guess we're up.

21
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,860
You never really believed
in Santa Claus, did you?

22
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,940
You should've come up
with a better story..

23
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,740
than a fat guy coming
down the chimney.

24
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,380
- It's so illogical.
- And illegal.

25
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,740
It's breaking and entering.

26
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,820
What kind of car was it?

27
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,580
Well, it was black.

28
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,340
- Okay.
- Why would they just drive off?

29
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,420
I don't know, sweetheart.

30
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,980
Get the box.

31
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,780
What is it?

32
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,500
Never seen anything like
it before in my life.

33
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,940
Well, you need a key to open it.

34
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,020
There's a note.

35
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,460
Looks like a wedding invitation.

36
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,860
Is it some sort of bridesmaid
gift from the Powells?

37
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,940
"Mr. Steward will call
upon you at 5 p.m."

38
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,460
Do you know a Mr. Steward?

39
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,220
I don't. Do you?

40
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,060
- It's snowing.
- It won't stick.

41
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,859
Hey. PB and J.

42
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,780
- Did you cut the bread into squares?
- Of course, like always.

43
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,020
Well, don't do that.
Squares are for babies.

44
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,580
- Hey, Mrs. Lewis.
- Hi, Mrs. Lewis.

45
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,860
Morning, boys.

46
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,260
Feel free to call me Norma.
Mrs. Lewis makes me feel old.

47
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,420
You are old.

48
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,580
I'm only 35.

49
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,500
Yeah, to us, that's old.

50
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,220
You're kind of a geezer.

51
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,220
You'll be a geezer one day
too, Mr. Smarty-Pants.

52
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,180
Why does the bus stop have to
be in the front of my driveway?

53
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,980
So I can watch my little Walter get
on the bus safe, in one piece.

54
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,220
Please go inside,
you're embarrassing me.

55
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,900
- My love embarrasses you?
- Yes, it does.

56
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,780
What if I give my big strong
Walter a big hug and a kiss..

57
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,780
right before he gets on the bus?

58
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,220
- Do it, do it.
- Mom, get off.

59
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,980
Bye, Walter. See you boys later.

60
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,780
<i>Will not be a year of
politics as usual.</i>

61
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,380
<i>It can be a year of
inspiration and hope.</i>

62
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,260
Little early for a midlife
crisis, don't you think?

63
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,740
- And it will be a year of concern..
- So, who's Mr. Steward?

64
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,380
- Of quiet & sober reassessment..
- I have no idea.

65
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,780
Is it someone from school?

66
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,460
I don't know.

67
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,900
Is it your secret lover?

68
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,580
I hate you.

69
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,780
I hate you too.

70
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,500
3 strangers

71
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,660
trapped in a room
for all eternity.

72
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,800
Each wanting something
from the other.

73
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,160
A wish unfulfilled.

74
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,660
This is Sartre's vision of hell.

75
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,220
Hell is other people.

76
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:51,260
Yes. Hell is other people seeing
you for who you truly are.

77
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,140
So, what does this
mean for Estelle?

78
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,260
It means she's going
to rot in hell.

79
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,180
She's a slut who married for
money and killed her baby.

80
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,380
It's slightly more complicated
than that, Charles.

81
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,140
See, she was poor and married
into money to save her family.

82
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,860
What happened to your foot?

83
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,380
I beg your pardon?

84
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,579
I've seen you limp.

85
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,980
Did something happen
to your foot?

86
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,780
Can we see it?

87
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,700
- My foot?
- Yeah.

88
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,540
Can we see what it looks like?

89
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,660
- Why don't you just shut up?
- Yeah, come on.

90
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,820
What? Are you embarrassed?

91
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,140
Oh, man.

92
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,180
Remember, everyone,
essays are due tomorrow.

93
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,460
All right, I'll do it.

94
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,220
Whether life has begun or not..

95
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,619
it is critical to our concept
of chemical evolution..

96
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,700
to determine the path
of carbon chemistry.

97
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,700
Mars offers the
first opportunity..

98
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,820
to gain another perspective
in the cosmic history..

99
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,500
of planetary chemistry.

100
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,940
- Are there any questions?
- What's the next step?

101
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,340
Yes, in the back. Rhonda.

102
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,140
Yes. Can you elaborate
on the soil tests?

103
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,980
The gas exchange experiment
measures the production..

104
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,820
or uptake of CO², nitrogen..

105
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,340
methane, hydrogen and oxygen..

106
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,540
during the incubation of
the Martian soil sample.

107
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,780
Why is the National
Security Agency involved?

108
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,019
The NSA?

109
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,540
Yes, Martin Teague, deputy director
of the NSA is here in Langley.

110
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,740
Why is the NSA here at Langley?

111
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,540
Would you tell us about tests..?

112
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,580
Would an ancient Martian civilization
have left something behind?

113
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,660
I have no comment, but I thank
you for the information, Rhonda.

114
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,500
Any other questions?

115
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,540
If we find water
beneath the surface..

116
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,300
and the orbiter photos of Utopia Planitia
indicate there were once rivers..

117
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,980
on the surface of the planet..

118
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,820
it's quite possible we'll
eventually find evidence of life.

119
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,260
And who are you?

120
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,580
Arthur Lewis. I used to
work in the optics lab.

121
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,300
I helped design the camera.

122
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,380
- There in the back.
- NASA continues funding..

123
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,260
In your short time with us, you've really
become part of our family here at Libby Hill.

124
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,620
That's why it's so difficult
to tell you this.

125
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:31,100
We've canceled the faculty
tuition discount.

126
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,460
Starting when?

127
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,900
Next semester.

128
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,340
I'm real sorry
about this, Norma.

129
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,740
I know you are.

130
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,820
Your nose is bleeding.

131
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,980
Why does your mom limp?

132
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,100
None of your business.

133
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,179
- So, what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

134
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,020
We're already living
paycheck to paycheck.

135
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,300
Well, what does Arthur think?

136
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,340
He doesn't know yet.

137
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,820
God, this is gonna
devastate him.

138
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,220
Then again, he's still
living on Mars.

139
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,460
- Man.
- What is it with that tie?

140
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,420
- 3rd time you've worn that this week.
- This is my lucky tie.

141
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,740
God knows you need it.

142
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,020
I should loan it to you
since today's the big day?

143
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,900
- Yep.
- Absolutely.

144
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,980
Planet Earth's not good enough for old
Arthur. He's gotta go up to outer space.

145
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,500
Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
We shall see.

146
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,260
Yeah. You're getting a little
too big for them britches.

147
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,820
I'll go upstairs & tell the boss you've been
working on a personal project on company
time.

148
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,760
- Is that what you're gonna do?
- Yeah. Absolutely.

149
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,580
- I'm gonna tell the big boss.
- Hey, Terry, don't blow the place up.

150
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,900
Well, it's a Christmas present for Norma.
Is that all right with you?

151
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,940
It's sweet, I guess.
Where's my present?

152
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,660
Merry Christmas.

153
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,660
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

154
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,340
Hello. May I help you?

155
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,740
Mrs. Lewis?

156
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,540
Yes?

157
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:23,020
Hello. My name is
Arlington Steward.

158
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,260
I assume you received the box
I left on your doorstep.

159
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,459
Yes.

160
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,340
And you found the button
unit inside the box?

161
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,860
Is that what you call it?

162
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,340
A button unit?

163
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,980
Yes, we do.

164
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,660
Please don't let my
appearance frighten you.

165
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,740
I assure you I'm not a monster.

166
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,980
I'm just a man with a job to do.

167
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,900
May I come in?

168
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,340
Sure.

169
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,380
Can I offer you anything?

170
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,380
No, thank you. I never
have much of an appetite.

171
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,900
Shall we sit down?

172
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,780
So..

173
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,420
are you trying to
sell me something?

174
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,660
Yes, in a way. I do
have an offer to make.

175
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,380
What are you offering?

176
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,660
A financial opportunity.

177
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,780
Let me explain.

178
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,580
In this envelope,
there is a key.

179
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,740
I'll show you.

180
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:46,100
This key opens the glass
dome to the button unit.

181
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,960
Voilà.

182
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,100
Now,

183
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,300
if you push the button,
2 things will happen.

184
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,520
First,

185
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,860
someone,
somewhere in the world,

186
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,860
whom you don't know..

187
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,580
will die.

188
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,180
Second..

189
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,380
you will receive a payment..

190
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,740
of 1 million dollars.

191
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,500
Tax-free.

192
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,140
The payment will be
delivered to you by me..

193
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,860
in cash.

194
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,100
Just as you see here.

195
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,740
And Mrs. Lewis,
please permit me..

196
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,500
to present to you

197
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,700
this crisp 100-dollar
bill as a gift..

198
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,260
in exchange for your kindness
in allowing me into your home.

199
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,540
You're gonna give me
this 100-dollar bill..

200
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,660
even if I say no?

201
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,900
That is correct.

202
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,460
Are you for real?

203
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,579
I assure you, Mrs. Lewis..

204
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,380
this offer is quite real.

205
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,900
Well, who do you work for?

206
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,620
Guarantee of payment comes with
3 restrictions, I'm afraid.

207
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,860
1, I am not permitted..

208
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,420
to disclose any information about
the identity of my employers.

209
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,460
2,

210
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,060
You are not permitted to discuss
the details of this with anyone..

211
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,980
except your husband, of course.

212
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,140
3,

213
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,500
You have 24 hours.

214
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,420
You have until 5:00 tomorrow
to make your decision.

215
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,340
At which point..

216
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:54,819
I shall return and
retrieve the button unit.

217
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,780
It will be reprogrammed..

218
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,940
and the offer will be
made to someone else.

219
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,740
It's been a pleasure
meeting you, Mrs. Lewis.

220
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,499
- It's a new prosthesis for her foot.
- You got it.

221
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,900
But I'm using the new
GE Silastic polymer..

222
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,900
they're developing for the
pilot chairs for the shuttle.

223
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,420
- Nice, pal.
- Thank you.

224
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,260
Hey. What happened to her foot?

225
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,460
When she was 17, her brother
dropped a barbell on her foot.

226
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,900
She thinks one of her toes is broken,
so she goes to the hospital.

227
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,740
The doctor sets her in a chair,
turns the x-ray machine on..

228
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,380
then goes to check on another
patient down the hall.

229
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,019
And he forgets all about Norma.

230
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,100
Leaves the x-ray
machine running.

231
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,180
Jesus, that's..

232
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,820
- That's not good.
- No.

233
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,700
The tissue in 4 of her toes was
completely destroyed by the radiation.

234
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,940
They had to amputate
4 of her toes?

235
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,700
Yep. Then they had to go in and
get skin from her inner thigh..

236
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,580
to cover the front of her foot.

237
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:13,180
This is back in 1958, so they didn't have
the skin-graft techniques they do now.

238
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,160
And she had to sit like
this, the same position..

239
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,420
full body cast, for a month,
waiting for it to heal.

240
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,580
Jesus. I hope she
sued this idiot.

241
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,020
Yeah. Her family
sued and they won.

242
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,460
- What was the settlement?
- 10,000 dollars.

243
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,500
If this sucker works, she
can start jogging again.

244
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,260
I hope so.

245
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,980
That's a nice thing
you're doing for Norma.

246
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,740
Thank you, sir.

247
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,780
One good turn deserves another.

248
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,740
This just arrived for you.
Certified mail from..

249
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,020
The Astronaut Corps?

250
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,740
This is a joke?

251
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,100
Well, that's the way it came.
Nobody opened it.

252
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,380
Well, it says I was rejected.

253
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,660
What?

254
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,820
Arthur Lewis.

255
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,540
His astronaut application
was rejected.

256
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,020
Can you tell me why?

257
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,740
Okay.

258
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,740
Arthur, they say you failed
the psychological exam.

259
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,340
You gotta be kidding me.

260
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,460
That makes no sense.

261
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,980
Norm, I aced every test.

262
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,220
I was counting on this.

263
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,700
You know?

264
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,540
What am I supposed to do
with the rest of my life?

265
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,940
There are many great
opportunities here.

266
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,700
Well, we just got a grant to develop optics
for the new planetary camera system.

267
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,020
You're perfect for it.

268
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,500
A quasi-managerial position
that doesn't exist?

269
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,580
Well, we'll always have Mars.

270
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,260
Before I could ask him any more questions,
he got in his car and drove away.

271
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,140
What are you doing? Be careful.

272
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,260
Come on, Norma, you can't
think this thing's real.

273
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,060
- Did you get his license plate?
- No.

274
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,540
Your dad's a cop. Always
gotta get the license plate.

275
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,300
Well, I was a
little overwhelmed.

276
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,540
Okay, so somewhere in the world
someone you don't know will die?

277
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,780
Yeah.

278
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,460
Yes, those were his exact words.

279
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,620
- Did he say how they would die?
- No.

280
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,860
And he offered you a
briefcase full of cash?

281
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,500
Yes, he said it was a million
dollars, and it looked real.

282
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,980
What did he look like?

283
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,500
You don't wanna know.

284
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,460
What do you mean?

285
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,460
Well, he must've
been a burn victim..

286
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,140
because half of his
face was gone.

287
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,940
- Really?
- Yes, gone.

288
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,380
- Are you messing with me?
- No.

289
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,500
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

290
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,340
We're gonna be
late for the play.

291
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,180
- I'll lock it up downstairs.
- All right.

292
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,660
I would like to buy St.
Charles Place.

293
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,260
Okay, St. Charles Place.

294
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,780
- Hi, Mrs. Lewis.
- Hi, Dana.

295
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,700
Did Mr. Steward show up?

296
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,300
Yeah, he stopped by.

297
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,900
Well, so, what does it do? What
happens when you push the button?

298
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,580
Nothing special.

299
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,860
Did he give you a key to the dome?
I bet it does something cool.

300
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,900
You sure do ask a
lot of questions.

301
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,460
And now you're avoiding them.

302
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,860
Hey, big mouth, that's enough.
All right?

303
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,620
In bed by 10:00?

304
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,740
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

305
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,020
- Thanks, Dana.
- Good night.

306
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,700
Good night.

307
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,900
- That's yours.
- Okay.

308
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,620
My turn.

309
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,060
He was very charming.

310
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:28,240
I honestly believe he would give us
that entire briefcase full of money.

311
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,300
Here you go.

312
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,820
Forever and ever and ever.

313
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,940
Well, well..

314
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,700
let's get on with it.

315
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,580
So, what are you thinking?

316
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,100
All right.

317
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,060
Look, there's absolutely no upside
for him in this deal, okay?

318
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,900
So he's a con artist. The
bill's a counterfeit.

319
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,460
You don't give someone $100
with no strings attached.

320
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,860
- That's just crazy.
- Maybe he is crazy.

321
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,300
I mean, maybe he's
mentally ill..

322
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,980
and he's just using this device as some
sort of excuse to murder someone..

323
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,420
and then blame us for it.

324
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,540
So should we call the police?
What do you wanna do?

325
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,000
If we tell anyone,
the deal is off.

326
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,180
No money.

327
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,500
- He said that?
- Yes, we can't tell anyone.

328
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,620
- Let's go home.
- All right. I'll get our coats.

329
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,220
Well, someone spent a lot
of time designing this.

330
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,060
Anodized aluminum,
handblown glass.

331
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,300
It looks expensive.

332
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,180
Hello.

333
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,500
What are you doing?

334
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,380
I'm gonna take a look inside.

335
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,180
Look at this silly..

336
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,060
There we go.

337
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,060
Nothing.

338
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,380
No transmitter, no radio.

339
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,660
If we pushed the button right now,
there's no way he'd even know.

340
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,460
Okay, just.. You know what?

341
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,860
Put it back together. I
don't want you breaking it.

342
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,220
Well, what do you care?

343
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,180
Because he's gonna come
back to retrieve it.

344
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,699
He says he takes the
box, he reprograms it..

345
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,300
and then he makes the
offer to someone else.

346
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,900
I don't know what he's gonna reprogram.
It's a piece of wood.

347
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,060
<i>People start pollution.
People can..</i>

348
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,540
So are you gonna push it or not?

349
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,260
It's not my decision to make.

350
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,140
It's ours, and I would never
push it without you knowing.

351
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,060
Don't forget to turn
off the tree lights.

352
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,300
No, I like leaving them on.

353
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,620
It's a fire hazard.

354
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:27,260
Yeah, but it keeps the Christmas
spirit alive while we sleep.

355
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,820
We could die.

356
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,500
Everybody dies, Norma.

357
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,460
Fine.

358
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,340
Leave them on.

359
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,620
Strange. He only makes house
calls when you're out of town.

360
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,780
- What are you thinking?
- I.. He..

361
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,700
I wanna tell you, Dr. Kirby is weird.
I went to his office..

362
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,940
I ' m thinking we're never
gonna see that much money.

363
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,820
He said he felt silly
standing around naked.

364
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,740
And why do you say that?

365
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,260
Be realistic, Arthur.

366
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,360
You work for the government.

367
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,260
God knows we both
spend too much money.

368
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,540
Sure would make it easier
to live the life we want.

369
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,700
Honey..

370
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,700
why do we need a million
dollars to be happy?

371
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,180
We don't.

372
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,460
But imagine what we
could accomplish.

373
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,180
I mean, we could provide
security for our entire family.

374
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,140
Look, you know, I don't need
to work at NASA forever.

375
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,180
I can get another job.

376
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,580
Are we ever gonna
leave Richmond?

377
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,380
We're gonna have to
postpone my foot surgery.

378
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,300
No, we're not doing that.
You need that surgery.

379
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,260
Yeah, I know, but
we can't afford it.

380
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,500
Well, then push the button.
See what happens.

381
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,020
I'm scared.

382
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,140
Norma, why are you scared?

383
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,060
You didn't see his face.

384
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,540
- I'm calling the police.
- You can't.

385
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,460
Right, because then
the deal is off.

386
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,460
Norma, how the hell is he gonna
know if we even call anyone?

387
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,340
Does he have the house bugged?

388
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,340
It's a gift to each of the
bridesmaids at the wedding.

389
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,100
They're gonna make a big
joke of it tonight and..

390
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,820
Doc Powell's gonna ask who pushed
the button and who didn't.

391
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,700
And everyone's gonna have a laugh
at the con artist he hired..

392
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,980
to show up at our doorstep.

393
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,980
<i>I was at the grocery store, and
she wandered into the next aisle.</i>

394
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,660
- Well, where is she?
- I ran out into the parking lot.

395
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,220
They put her in the back
of a van and drove off.

396
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,020
Okay.

397
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,019
Look, lock all the doors.

398
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,579
She just vanished, Jeffrey.

399
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,540
I'm on my way home.

400
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,460
I ran a test on it at work.

401
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,300
This hundred-dollar
bill is real.

402
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,460
So let's assume it's all real.

403
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,820
We push the button, we
get a million dollars..

404
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:24,220
and we can be responsible for the
death of another human being.

405
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,060
Is that something
we can live with?

406
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,780
What if it's someone's baby?

407
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,780
What if it's a
murderer on death row?

408
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,820
What if it's our neighbors
across the street?

409
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,140
Do you even know them?

410
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,620
Doug and Donna.

411
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,260
What is it to really
know someone, Norma?

412
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,460
Do you know me?

413
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,860
Better than you know yourself.

414
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,380
Do you know Walter?

415
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,740
Even better than I know you.

416
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,460
What do we wanna do, Norma?

417
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,900
It's just a box.

418
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,860
911 Emergency, how may
I direct your call?

419
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,260
Excuse me, you need to slow down. I
can't understand what you're saying.

420
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,020
So you heard loud screaming?
Then a gunshot?

421
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,420
10-4.

422
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,340
I heard a gunshot..

423
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,140
then he ran out the front door with
a briefcase and got in his car.

424
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,940
Ma'am, get back inside. Take the
boy and go back inside right now.

425
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,460
Jimmy.

426
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,740
Check her pulse.

427
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,860
Let's go.

428
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,700
All right, get back, I
gotta kick the door down.

429
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,060
Get away from the door!

430
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,900
Jesus.

431
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,980
Okay.

432
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,220
Hello, Mrs. Lewis.

433
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,980
Hello.

434
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,820
Shall I come in?

435
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,460
Hello. You must be Mr. Lewis.

436
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,620
Forgive me, I have a rather busy day.
Shall we?

437
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,460
Do you have the key?

438
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,420
Thank you.

439
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,980
There we are. 1 million dollars.

440
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,300
You can count it, if you like.

441
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,460
Did someone..?

442
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,460
- Die?
- Yeah.

443
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,860
Of course.

444
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,820
You said before that the button
unit would be reprogrammed.

445
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,300
Yes.

446
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,340
What happens now? Are you gonna
make the offer to someone else?

447
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,460
Well, yes, Mrs. Lewis.
That's how it works.

448
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:46,660
And I can promise you that the offer
will be made to someone you don't know.

449
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,980
No.

450
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,780
Hey.

451
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,780
Hey.

452
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,780
We don't want your money.
Take it.

453
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,940
I'm sorry, Mr. Lewis.

454
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,020
The button has been pushed.

455
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,860
Good day.

456
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,620
Hey.

457
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,900
Open the door.

458
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,100
Open the door!

459
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:50,020
XH34568. I got his
license plate.

460
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,220
What are you thinking, Norma?

461
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,420
Someone we don't know.

462
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,980
Does that mean we're next?

463
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,060
Is that what he meant?

464
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,940
All right, let's just..

465
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,820
- Walter.
- Yeah.

466
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,180
Okay, put the money in the safe.

467
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,340
Not today.

468
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,860
Homework first.

469
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,260
Clean out your lunch
pail too, okay?

470
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,500
Come on.

471
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,700
We got ourselves another
domestic homicide.

472
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,620
This time it's the wife.

473
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,100
Really?

474
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,240
The victim's name
is Diane Carnes,

475
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,940
31 years old, gunshot
wound to the chest.

476
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,380
They found her little girl
locked in the bathroom.

477
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,420
- Husband?
- Husband is unaccounted for.

478
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:05,020
Neighbors saw him bolt out the front
door after they heard a gunshot.

479
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,420
Has the husband got any priors?

480
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,500
No. And that's the thing.

481
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,980
Husband is Jeffrey Carnes..

482
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,580
described as a loving father
by all the neighbors..

483
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,180
and he's a rocket scientist.

484
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,140
Works for NASA.

485
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,180
Really?

486
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,580
It doesn't hurt anymore.

487
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,180
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

488
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,940
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

489
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,380
Enjoy your evening.

490
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,660
All of this for a
rehearsal dinner?

491
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,060
Remember our rehearsal dinner?

492
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,380
- You mean the keg party in the backyard?
- Yeah, that.

493
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,940
Here's my little girl.

494
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,460
- Hello.
- Look at the way she walks. You float.

495
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,300
- You knew about that?
- Hi, how are you?

496
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,700
Good to see you.

497
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,820
Santa came early and
brought your step back.

498
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,460
That he did, Mama.

499
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,380
- How are you, Dick?
- How are you, Arthur?

500
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,500
Good to see you.

501
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,980
- Congratulations.
- Hi, Lana.

502
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,620
Arthur, now, is Norma
still cutting your hair?

503
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,340
Yeah, who are you,
Lynyrd or Skynyrd?

504
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,180
Honey, they're not gonna let you into
outer space with those sideburns.

505
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,260
Everybody's wearing
them like that now.

506
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,940
Well, honey, I know, but..

507
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,939
Forget about it. Where
did you get that?

508
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,980
- Right back over in there.
- All right. You want something?

509
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,940
- Sherry.
- All right.

510
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,380
Excuse me.

511
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,420
Folks, could I have your
attention for just a minute?

512
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,580
We'd really like to thank
all of you for coming out..

513
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:31,420
on such an unseasonably
cold night in Richmond.

514
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,260
Now, I'm told that I'm supposed
to keep this quite short..

515
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,380
because we have another 43
speeches coming tonight.

516
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:44,220
Friends of the bride & groom have very
generously donated this array of gifts.

517
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,860
And it being the holiday season, we
thought it'd be a good idea to have a..

518
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,740
Well, to have a
holiday-gift drawing.

519
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,500
- All right, Lana, let's..
- You need to mix these up.

520
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,780
- Let's do it. Okay, I will.
- Like you're spiking a punch bowl.

521
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,700
- He knows how to do that.
- No, I've never done that.

522
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,220
Never done that.

523
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,940
All right, here we go.

524
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,340
My son-in-law. Not you. Arthur.

525
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,540
Come on up.

526
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,460
- Boys.
- I have to get up?

527
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,740
Come on up, Arthur. Come on up.

528
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:18,300
Folks, I did not rig this. I'm
an honest cop. I swear I am.

529
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,540
All right, get your gift, lucky.

530
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,980
- All right, just pick anything here?
- Any gift that you like, yes, sir.

531
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,780
Just leave those golf clubs, all right?
Those are mine.

532
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,620
No, you can have the clubs,
you can have the clubs.

533
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,340
You know, I'm just gonna..

534
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,940
I'm gonna take this
box right here.

535
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,900
- He's so polite.
- That's a nice plain gift, isn't it?

536
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,380
All right, here we go. Let's get another
one here, let's see what we got.

537
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,060

- Come on up, Leticia.
- Well? Open it.

540
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,940
Why don't you go put it in the car?
We'll open it up when we get home.

541
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,740
- No.
- No.

542
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,460
You gotta open it here. Gotta
see what's inside the box.

543
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,580
- Yeah, come on, open it.
- Mike Smith here?

544
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:30,460
Keep this moving, folks. Remember,
we still have 43 speeches.

545
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,460
Arthur, that's him.

546
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,460
What is it, a photograph?

547
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,860
Yeah. Yeah.

548
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,980
- Well, let's see it.
- No, no, it's an inside joke.

549
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,100
It's private.

550
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,100
Nice. All right, yeah,
we know about that.

551
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:49,340
We've taken some private photographs.
We could trade up.

552
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,780
Let your minds run
wild with that.

553
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,460
Is that the one you brought?

554
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,340
What about this
rehearsal dinner?

555
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:58,300
Can you imagine what the
wedding's gonna be like?

556
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,980
Astounding Science Fiction.

"Day of the Moron "?

558
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:15,940
Yeah. My dad collects comics.

559
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,420
What else does he collect?

560
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,660
Well, he has a bunch of Mars stuff
in the basement. You wanna see?

561
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,740
Yeah.

562
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,380
Come on.

563
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,900
What's your dad have
to do with the Viking?

564
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,260
He helped design the camera.

565
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,820
They designed it so that
it photographs 360°.

566
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,540
It scans the image
one line at a time.

567
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,780
Takes about 5 minutes to
complete one revolution.

568
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,580
How do they get the images
from Mars back to Earth?

569
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,660
Radio transmissions.

570
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:21,300
They figured out a way to interpret
the data & then print it out on film.

571
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,700
How long does it take
to transmit the signal?

572
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,600
About 2 hours.

573
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,440
The signal travels 58 million
miles in about 5 minutes.

574
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,900
They tested it out
last year in Colorado.

Look, I don't think that we should
say anything to my father, okay?

577
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:54,140
Let's see how that new foot works

Arthur C. Clarke's 3rd law.

581
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:11,660
My dad knows him.

582
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:36,140
Arthur, that was a wonderful
thing you did for Norma.

583
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,820
I don't know what
she'd do without you.

584
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,220
I don't know what
I'd do without her.

585
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,180
Really, I don't.

586
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:46,100
- That was the perfect gift.
- Thank you.

Thank you.

[Derek And The Dominos'
Bell Bottom Blues]

589
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,660
It's a really nice party, Dick.

590
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,460
- Yeah.
- Congratulations.

591
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,900
- And I'm not paying for it.
- You're not paying?

592
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,260
No.

593
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,659
- Well, how did you work that out?
- No, no, no.

594
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:41,700
Hey, listen, you think you could
run a license plate for me?

595
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:45,060
This is a black sedan. You think
you could find out who owns it?

596
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,060
Yeah, sure. What's going on?

597
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,460
It's just someone hanging
around the house, you know.

598
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:52,900
- It's probably nothing, just wanna be safe.
- Yeah. It's worth checking.

599
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,500
What's the deal with this kid?
He flashed me the peace sign.

600
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,700
- He's one of your students, isn't he?
- Norma didn't tell you?

601
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,860
No, she didn't. What's..?

602
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:22,860
Well, he humiliated her in
front of the entire class.

603
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,100
He made fun of her foot.

604
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,380
You've got a bloody nose.

605

Thank you.

606
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,660
Is there something
I can get for you?

607
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,540
Well, you said that
I had a phone call.

608
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,420
Yes. Right here.

609

I'm afraid trouble has
found you, Mrs. Lewis.

There are always consequences.

Okay, what are we
supposed to do now?

You wanna tell me what
you said to my wife?

Is that funny to you?
Is that funny?

627

Making fun of someone's
disfigurement's funny to you?

Is that funny to you?

00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,939
Dana. We're back.

634
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,620
Okay.

635
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,340
- Do you have a ride home?
- No.

636
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,460
Okay, Arthur can take you.

637
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:46,420
- Okay.
- Here you go.

638
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:48,580
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

639
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,780
So where am I taking you?

640
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:59,700
There's a motel off I-95,
the Galaxy Motor Lodge.

641
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,900
You're staying in a motel?

642
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:06,020
Yeah. My parents bought a new
house, but it's not ready yet.

643
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,020
You've got blood on your hands.

644
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:31,700
- What do you mean by that?
- Your hands.

645
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,540
Are those blood stains?

646
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,100
Yeah, I got into
a fight tonight.

647
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:42,060
Embarrassed everyone and
ruined the whole party.

648
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:46,580
Somebody pushing your buttons?

649
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:50,860
Why would you say that?

650
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:53,420
Just an expression.

651
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:59,780
Don't jump to conclusions. You'll get
yourself in a whole heap of trouble.

652
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:05,060
Well, I'm already in a
whole heap of trouble.

653
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,460
What are you gonna do about it?

654
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:12,220
I don't know. You got
any suggestions?

655
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,260
Look into the light.

656
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,100
- The light?
- Yeah, the light.

657
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:23,540
Soon you'll be blinded by it.

658
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,460
What is the light?

659
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:31,620
I cannot remember.

660
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,980
I cannot remember.

661
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,020
Dana?

662
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,260
Dana.

663
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:58,700
Wake up.

664
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,820
Dana?

665
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,580
Jesus Christ.

666
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,220
Are you okay?

667
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:49,380
You have to get out of here.
It's not safe for you here.

668
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,660
Slow down. What are
you talking about?

669
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:54,180
There's only one person
who can save you now.

670
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:57,460
Look in the mirror. You'll see.

671
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:01,660
Dana. Dana!

672
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:08,780
<i>The first picture you saw
which included the footpads..</i>

673
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,740
<i>took about 5 minutes
to take on Mars..</i>

674
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:16,460
<i>and then it is transmitted by a
relay radio up to the orbiter..</i>

675
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:23,420
<i>July 20, 1969..</i>

676
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:27,620
<i>we received a transmission
from the Moon telling us:</i>

677
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:30,660
<i>"The Eagle has landed. "</i>

678
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:34,700
<i>Today's landing, like that one,
represents the realization of a dream..</i>

679
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:38,420
<i>that has long excited
mankind's imagination.</i>

680
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:43,300
<i>And this mission offers the possibility
of a momentous discovery..</i>

681
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,660
<i>in the history of mankind:</i>

682
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:48,860
<i>The existence of life
elsewhere in the universe.</i>

683
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:56,500
<i>If the experiments of Vikings 1 and
2 do not reveal living organisms..</i>

684
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,179
<i>they will learn other
secrets of the universe.</i>

685
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:02,700
<i>They will tell us a good many
things about our own planet..</i>

686
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:06,100
<i>opening up new possibilities
for exploration..</i>

687
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:10,260
<i>and should produce knowledge that
will improve the quality of life..</i>

688
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,340
<i>right here on Earth.</i>

689
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:17,740
<i>Our achievements in space represent not
only the height of technological skill..</i>

690
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:22,460
<i>they also reflect the
best in our country..</i>

691
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:26,340
<i>our character, the capacity for
creativity and sacrifice..</i>

692
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,060
<i>and a willingness to
reach into the unknown.</i>

693
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,060
Norma.

694
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:38,940
Where did you say you met Dana?

695
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:42,860
On our field trip to the
Kennedy Center in D.C.

696
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,980
Right. And she said she
lives in Richmond?

697
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:47,700
Yeah, we rode back
on the same bus.

698
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:50,140
Okay. This is her
driver's license.

699
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,220
Her name is Sarah Matthews.

700
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,060
She lives in Boston.

701
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:05,420
He called them his employees?

702
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,860
Yup.

703
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,820
Hello, Norma.

704
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,900
Hello.

705
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:39,940
Did your husband tell you where
he was going this morning?

706
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,340
No, he didn't.

707
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:45,940
I hope for your sake he isn't
playing detective again.

708
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:49,300
Though I assure you,
I'll know if he is.

709
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:51,740
Because of your employees?

710
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:54,580
Is Dana one of your employees?

711
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:58,540
As I've told you, I
have many employees.

712
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:03,180
Can I see you? In person?

713
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,820
I wanna meet face to face.

714
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:10,580
I'm looking at you
right now, Norma.

715
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:12,420
Excuse me?

716
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,860
I'm in your backyard.

717
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:43,500
Are you still there?

718
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,860
Mr. Steward?

719
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:13,060
All right, hold on. We
want to get this straight.

720
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,460
You've had the wind
tunnel for months.

721
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:18,420
Now you want the lunar
lander and the hangar?

722
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,860
That is correct.

723
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,980
- The NSA activity..
- What kind of activity?

724
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:28,099
The activities will occasionally
involve NASA employees..

725
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,900
but I am not at liberty to disclose
how they will be involved..

726
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,620
or what they will be doing.

727
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:36,540
I think this whole thing's outrageous, but
we don't really have any choice, do we?

728
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:40,580
No. You don't.

729
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:44,940
Did you get a chance to run
that license plate yet?

730
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:47,900
Yeah, I did. It's a
government-issued license plate.

731
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:50,820
It's a town car licensed
for use by the NSA.

732
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:53,540
The NSA?

733
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:57,100
Jesus Christ.

734
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:00,540
What are those?

735
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:05,540
This guy's wife, she was shot once
in the chest. Point-blank range.

736
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:08,380
Whoever shot her held a gun
directly to her chest..

737
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:11,060
and fired the bullet
straight through her heart.

738
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:14,020
The husband works at Langley.

739
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,699
Was there any sign
of a struggle?

740
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:19,660
No?

741
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:23,220
There's no skin under
her nails, no bruises.

742
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:26,620
What time did she die?

743
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:29,740
Neighbors say they heard
the shot at 4:45 p.m.

744
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:35,460
What's all this to you, Arthur?

745
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:40,020
Do you think you could
take me to his house?

746
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:47,540
Well, your sister feels
awful about last night.

747
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,540
Arthur's just sick about it too.

748
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:51,460
Well, Norma, let
me just say this.

749
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:54,500
Daddy and I have always
marveled at your strength..

750
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:58,180
and how positive you always
are, even since your injury.

751
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:01,020
And I just wonder if
maybe sometimes..

752
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:04,260
we don't take for granted
that you are all right?

753
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:06,220
I'm fine, Mama.

754
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:18,220
NSA is letting him do it. NASA can't stop it.
Test subjects are all under 40.

755
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:21,860
Happily married with a child. Go to the
Richmond Library. Follow this call number.

756
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:24,420
Don't trust anyone, not
even your husband.

757
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:25,980
My Lord.

758
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:28,820
She's bleeding.
Somebody call for help.

759
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:30,580
My heavens.

760
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:36,780
Who is that woman, Norma?
Do you know her?

761
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:39,900
No, I don't, Mama.

762
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:45,820
Listen, I have a lot of errands
to run before the wedding.

763
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:48,100
Can I drop you off at home?

764
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:02,700
Don't touch.

765
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:04,420
That's him.

766
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:07,180
He's the public-relations
manager at Langley.

767
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:10,100
- What's his name?
- Arlington Steward.

768
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:12,500
- Steward?
- Steward with a D.

769
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:15,900
- Can you check him out?
- Yeah.

770
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:19,540
There's 3 dead so far.

771
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:23,460
"Human Resource
Exploitation Manual."

772
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:26,459
- Call numbers?
- I want to put in a request..

773
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:28,339
for a search warrant
down in Langley.

774
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:31,220
But don't put the request
in through my office.

775
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:33,620
Whatever it is, it's
bigger than you and me.

776
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,900
Excuse me, I'm looking
for the nearest exit.

777
01:06:56,140 --> 01:07:00,780
You aren't an employee. This
library is for employees only.

778
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:04,820
You're his wife.

779
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:07,100
I am Clymene.

780
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:37,620
What does he want from us?

781
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:39,780
He's testing you.

782
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,940
He's testing all of us.

783
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:47,300
Please, follow me.

784
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,540
There are 3 gateways..

785
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:10,140
but you may choose only one.

786
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:13,940
Be careful which
gateway you choose..

787
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:17,740
for there is only one
path to salvation.

788
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:10,460
Have a seat, Mrs. Lewis.

789
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:36,780
Indistinguishable from magic.

790
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:41,980
Lightning strikes the earth
100 times per second.

791
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:44,780
A single bolt of lightning
can reach temperatures..

792
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:49,380
approaching 28,000° Celsius
in a split second.

793
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:54,300
This is 5 times hotter than
the surface of the sun.

794
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:58,660
Is that what happened to you?

795
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:02,060
- You were struck by lightning?
- Yes.

796
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:08,700
And now I am in communication with
those who control the lightning.

797
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:13,940
And what lies
behind the other 2?

798
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:15,700
Eternal damnation.

799
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:19,940
Right.

800
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:27,700
What's the emotion you felt when
you first laid eyes on me, Norma?

801
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:30,900
- I felt..
- You felt what?

802
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:32,900
- I felt..
- Pity?

803
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:34,460
Love.

804
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:40,500
- You felt love for me?
- Yes.

805
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:42,580
Why?

806
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:45,660
Because of my disfigurement.

807
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:50,780
Because of all of the pain that
it ever caused me in my life.

808
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:57,020
I thought what it would be like
to have all of that pain..

809
01:10:57,180 --> 01:11:01,720
magnified and projected
onto my face.

810
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,460
And if I refuse?

811
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:12,060
Eternal damnation.

812
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:18,580
You have chosen
Gateway number 2.

813
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:32,340
I saw that pain on
your face and I just..

814
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,460
I understood it.

815
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:41,780
I felt an overwhelming
feeling of love for you..

816
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:44,500
because I knew
that I would never

817
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:47,800
feel sorry for
myself ever again.

818
01:11:57,900 --> 01:12:00,140
Take my hand, Norma.

819
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:57,060
You don't remember
coming home, do you?

820
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:00,900
You came in your car. You walked
in the door like a zombie.

821
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:03,580
You didn't say anything. You
just went straight up to bed.

822
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:07,300
Where did all this
water come from?

823
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:10,340
- Why isn't Dad telling us what happened?
- Walter.

824
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,820
Go down to the basement
and get me more buckets.

825
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:15,260
- But I just want..
- Walter.

826
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:16,780
Fine.

827
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:29,420
Can you tell me what happened?

828
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:32,100
I need a drink.

829
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,740
Are we still going
to the wedding?

830
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:50,260
Yeah.

831
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:57,060
There is only so much information
that I can disclose.

832
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:58,540
I understand.

833
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:06,180
In the hours following the first
Viking transmission from Mars..

834
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:08,060
your colleague
Arlington Steward..

835
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:11,140
was struck by lightning while
standing here on this platform.

836
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:14,260
Yes. And we haven't heard
from him since then.

837
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:18,980
He's something else now.

838
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:20,940
What do you mean?

839
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:24,340
Arlington Steward died shortly after
being admitted to the burn unit..

840
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,220
at Riverside Hospital.

841
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:28,740
Several hours after his body
was taken to the morgue..

842
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:30,740
and locked in a freezer
storage unit..

843
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,700
a nurse heard a voice coming
from behind a metal door.

844
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:36,660
It was a man, laughing.

845
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:41,380
Mr. Steward had come back from the
dead and he was laughing hysterically.

846
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:45,739
He was then transferred to a
high-security military hospital.

847
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:47,820
Soon after, we realized he was..

848
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:51,340
demonstrating some
extraordinary capabilities.

849
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:54,580
What do you mean
by capabilities?

850
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:59,500
His body healed at a rate 10
times faster than normal.

851
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:02,900
Cellular degeneration
essentially halted.

852
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:13,940
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. and Mrs. Edward Powell.</i>

853
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:02,540
Hi.

854
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:07,620
- You can't drink too much now, all right?
- All right.

855
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:16,860
Sir, if you don't
mind my asking..

856
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:19,540
why a box?

857
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:25,580
Your home is a box.

858
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:29,060
Your car is a box on wheels.

859
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:33,580
You drive to work in it.
You drive home in it.

860
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:37,900
You sit in your home,
staring into a box.

861
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:39,740
It erodes your soul..

862
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:44,220
while the box that is your body
inevitably withers, then dies..

863
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:50,900
whereupon it is placed in the
ultimate box to slowly decompose.

864
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:55,460
It's quite depressing when
you think of it that way.

865
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:58,339
Don't think of it that way.

866
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:01,020
Think of it as a temporary
state of being.

867
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:09,100
What happens once you've
completed your tests?

868
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:12,940
I submit the data
to my employers..

869
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:16,300
and then your fate
rests in their hands.

870
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:20,620
One cannot say they are not
without a bizarre sense of humor.

871
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:22,980
Look at me.

872
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:26,420
I wouldn't know, sir, of
whom it is that you speak.

873
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:31,459
Your employers remain
a mystery to us all.

874
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:33,380
I like mystery.

875
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:36,620
Don't you?

876
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:42,940
- How do we pass the test?
- Isn't it obvious?

877
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:45,980
Simply don't press the button.

878
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:49,260
If enough of you don't,
the test will conclude.

879
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:53,060
But there will be
more tests to come.

880
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:55,620
Walk directly into the light.

881
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:59,060
Do not turn back under
any circumstances.

882
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:03,620
When you walk into the light, you're gonna
feel your body submerged in a liquid.

883
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:05,660
Try to hold your breath.

884
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:09,580
If you feel a drowning
sensation, it will pass.

885
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:38,860
Where are you sending them?

886
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:42,340
To prepare for the next
test in Massachusetts.

887
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:48,420
You spoke earlier about
the altruism coefficient.

888
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:53,220
If human beings are unable or unwilling
to sacrifice individual desires..

889
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:56,780
for the greater good of your species,
you will have no chance for survival.

890
01:19:57,060 --> 01:20:01,500
And my employers will be compelled
to expedite your extinction.

891
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:03,460
Clear?

892
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:05,180
Yes, sir.

893
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:24,300
[Scott Walker's When
Joanna Loved Me]

894
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:49,620
I was gone, Norma.

895
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:54,420
I was gone for nearly an hour.

896
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:00,220
What did you see?

897
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:03,620
Well, what was there
in the light?

898
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:13,460
Words can't describe it.

899
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:17,940
It's a place..

900
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:20,780
neither here nor there..

901
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:24,940
but somewhere in between.

902
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:34,820
It's a warm embrace.

903
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:39,320
A place where..

904
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,820
the sidewalk ends..

905
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:48,700
and despair is no longer the
governor of the human heart.

906
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:12,820
Dad. What's going on?

907
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:22,700
I'm gonna be sick, Walter.

908
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,820
You can still save yourself.

909
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:50,300
It's too late for me, but you
can still save yourself.

910
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:55,340
Jeffrey Carnes. Boy, do I got
a lot of questions for you.

911
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:59,540
If you want to survive this thing,
you'll come with me. Right now.

912
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:02,940
All right, why don't you put the
gun down before someone sees you?

913
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:05,220
Get in the truck.

914
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:07,100
All right.

915
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:34,460
Dad.

916
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:36,620
Walter.

917
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:58,180
- Dad.
- Walter.

918
01:23:58,380 --> 01:23:59,460
Walter.

919
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:04,420
Walter! Walter!

920
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:07,420
Walter!

921
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:26,140
Those are classified

"Test subjects and free will.

923

Test subjects cannot be
treated like employees."

924
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:33,940
- Frontal lobe hemorrhage?
- That's his weakness.

925
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:37,340
He hasn't figured out how to get in
their heads without them noticing.

926
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:39,220
- The nosebleeds.
- You see lots of them?

927
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:40,620
Yeah.

928
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:43,660
And so there's limits to what it can do.
It's fallible.

929
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:45,220
Living inside a 70-year-old man?

930
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:47,580
Yeah, that's why it
embedded itself at Langley.

931
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:51,700
It's got everything it needs:
military, CIA, FBI, NASA.

932
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:56,340
So he can be killed?

933
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:58,020
Yes.

934
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:22,580
<i>The existence of life
elsewhere in the universe.</i>

935
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:24,300
Where are we going?

936
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:27,580
Look, it's kidnapped your son,
just like it took my daughter.

937
01:25:27,740 --> 01:25:29,420
- What?
- But I know where it has him hidden.

938
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:33,780
There's a motel off I-95. It's.. Steward's
employees who took your son there.

939
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:35,340
It's a transport hub.

940
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,980
There's a swimming pool they
use, a sort of gateway.

941
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,260
So did you push the button
or was it your wife?

942
01:25:57,820 --> 01:26:01,780
- My wife.
- Yeah. Yeah, mine too.

943
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:05,900
And now she's dead.

944
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:08,859
Did you kill her?

945
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:10,220
I did it for my daughter.

946
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:12,420
What do you mean, you did
it for your daughter?

947
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:17,420
I had to make a choice between
my wife and my daughter.

948
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:27,860
Follow the progress of
our Viking mission..

949
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:30,180
and to reflect on our journey..

950
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:32,020
into the unknown.

951
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:04,060
Was there anyone in
the truck with him?

952
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:06,180
Not that we saw.

953
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:20,660
Let's move!

954
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:24,380
All teams execute!

955
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:30,220
Bravo, Charlie,
forward position.

956
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:09,220
Weapons tight.

957
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:15,860
Move, move, move!

958
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:25,219
Arthur. Arthur, listen to me. Whatever
happens to you from this point on..

959
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:28,940
will have greater ramifications
than you can possibly fathom.

960
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:51,620
Please, have a seat.

961
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:55,180
Where's our son?

962
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:59,020
He's in a safe place. We'll
get to him in a moment.

963
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:00,540
Please sit down.

964
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:11,100
I want you to know..

965
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:16,020
that I have the deepest respect
and admiration for you both.

966
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:20,420
You gave me hope.

967
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:26,860
But I am very sorry that
you pushed the button.

968
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:31,780
I'm afraid I have to tell you..

969
01:30:31,940 --> 01:30:35,340
that 2 of your son's functional
senses have been impaired.

970
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:40,180
He can no longer see and
he can no longer hear.

971
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:47,100
Where is he?

972
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:49,940
What have you done with him?

973
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:55,500
I have done nothing with him.
I am just a vessel.

974
01:30:56,500 --> 01:31:00,340
You are now presented
with 2 options.

975
01:31:00,980 --> 01:31:03,420
Option 1, you can live
the rest of your lives..

976
01:31:03,740 --> 01:31:06,380
and enjoy the money that
has been given to you..

977
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:09,580
and learn to live with your
son's permanent impairment.

978
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:11,419
It is irreversible.

979
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:15,580
He will never hear your voices
or see your faces again.

980
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:30,980
Option 2..

981
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:36,380
there is one bullet in
the chamber of this gun.

982
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:40,460
You can fire it into your
wife's heart, killing her.

983
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:44,180
At the exact moment your
spirit leaves your body..

984
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:46,620
your son will be
returned to normal.

985
01:31:51,980 --> 01:31:53,380
As for the million dollars..

986
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:55,980
it will be placed into an
interest-bearing account..

987
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:58,940
given to your son on
his 18th birthday.

988
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:04,940
Let me kill myself. Arthur
has nothing to do with this.

989
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:09,420
I'm sorry. The offer
is nonnegotiable.

990
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:12,420
Arthur, you must fire the gun.

991
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:13,940
Norma, you must die..

992
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:19,300
or Walter will live forever
in darkness and silence.

993
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:45,460
Kill me if you like, Mr. Lewis, and
condemn your son to a life of agony.

994
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:49,860
You will be imprisoned for the murder
of Arlington Steward, a mere employee.

995
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:53,820
And they will simply send
another to replace me.

996
01:32:56,660 --> 01:32:58,540
Who?

997
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:01,620
- Who will send another?
- Arthur, please don't.

998
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:03,940
- Who?
- Don't.

999
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:06,900
Good day to you.

1000
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:30,180
Mr. Steward.

1001
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:37,860
Can I be forgiven?

1002
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:41,540
I don't know.

1003
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:46,940
I understand you admire the
writings of Jean-Paul Sartre.

1004
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:50,500
Perhaps these words
will comfort you.

1005
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:55,500
There are 2 ways to enter
the final chamber:

1006
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:57,980
Free or not free.

1007
01:33:58,740 --> 01:34:00,860
The choice is ours.

1008
01:34:13,820 --> 01:34:16,100
You gave me a glimpse of
the afterlife, didn't you?

1009
01:34:17,820 --> 01:34:20,180
Because this is purgatory.

1010
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:24,380
And you're here to shut us down.

1011
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:47,700
Your son is locked in
the upstairs bathroom.

1012
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:54,580
- Walter!
- Walter!

1013
01:34:54,740 --> 01:34:57,140
Walter! Sweetheart!

1014
01:34:57,340 --> 01:34:58,620
Sweetheart, can you hear us?

1015
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:01,380
Is anyone out there?

1016
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:04,700
- Walter!
- Is anyone out there?

1017
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:06,820
They must have locked
it on the other side.

1018
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:10,460
I can't see. Please. Help me.

1019
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:12,660
- Walter!
- Walter!

1020
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:19,859
- Sweetheart..
- I can't hear.

1021
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:22,380
Please, help me.

1022
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:29,380
Walter. Just back away from
the door if you can hear me.

1023
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:33,500
- Somebody, help.
- Walter!

1024
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:36,060
He can't hear us.

1025
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:38,420
He can't hear us.

1026
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:40,380
Stop it. Arthur, stop!

1027
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:43,300
Please!

1028
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:48,980
Arthur..

1029
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:50,940
Mom.

1030
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:54,900
- Dad. Please.
- Stop. Stop this.

1031
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:56,780
Look..

1032
01:35:57,340 --> 01:35:58,780
I can't.

1033
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:00,540
I can't see him like that.

1034
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:03,020
I can't.

1035
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:21,580
God.

1036
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:55,340
No.

1037
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:38,340
I can't do this.

1038
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:41,100
We cannot leave him like this.

1039
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:43,020
It's the only way.

1040
01:37:44,180 --> 01:37:46,020
There's no other way.

1041
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:48,260
There's no..

1042
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:51,340
He smiled at us.

1043
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:53,100
What?

1044
01:37:53,380 --> 01:37:56,180
When you asked him about the
afterlife, he smiled at us.

1045
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:03,780
- He did, did he?
- Yeah.

1046
01:38:06,020 --> 01:38:07,460
Arthur..

1047
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:10,620
I love you and I am so sorry.

1048
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:13,380
I'm so sorry for
what I did to us.

1049
01:38:15,020 --> 01:38:17,660
You didn't do anything.
We did it.

1050
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:19,820
So don't apologize.

1051
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:24,220
I love you.

1052
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:28,860
And I regret nothing in this
life we've lived together.

1053
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:34,580
Then I..

1054
01:38:34,740 --> 01:38:36,860
will count the days..

1055
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:40,940
until my Arthur comes
to see me again.

1056
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:51,740
I'm gonna push it.

1057
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:09,660
Until we meet again. Yeah.

1058
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:14,860
Let's get on with it.

1059
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:34,300
Subtitle: Arigon

1060
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:55,060
911 Emergency, how may
I direct your call?

1061
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:59,460
You said you heard a gunshot?
What is the address?

1062
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:03,380
7321 Park..

1063
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:05,140
in Antrim.

1064
01:40:10,660 --> 01:40:12,540
Hello, Mrs. Weller.

1065
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:14,300
Shall I come in?

1066
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:25,260
Walter?

1067
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:28,780
Walter?

1068
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:34,300
Walter, it's your
dad, I'm right here.

1069
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:36,460
Can you hear me?

1070
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:45,500
Walter?

1071
01:40:48,380 --> 01:40:49,940
Walter.

1072
01:40:50,140 --> 01:40:53,780
Walter, if you can hear me, just yell or
something. I'm right outside the door.

1073
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:56,300
Hands on your head and
move away from the door.

1074
01:40:56,860 --> 01:40:58,420
Dad!

1075
01:40:59,140 --> 01:41:00,260
Mom!

1076
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:04,100
I'm right here, honey. Everything's
gonna be fine, okay? Just hang tight.

1077
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:09,500
I said, put your hands on your
head and move away from the door.

1078
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:18,940
Walter's upstairs. He's okay.

1079
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:22,620
They assure me you and your
son will be taken care of.

1080
01:43:10,700 --> 01:43:14,100
