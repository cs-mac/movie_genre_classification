1
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,528
Lettuce, tomato, onion.

2
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,564
Uh, pickles.

3
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,633
And tzatziki sauce.

4
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:44,335
Oh, and, uh,
a little hot sauce, too.

5
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:47,005
Hot sauce, okay.

6
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,011
Hi.

7
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,579
Thank you, ma'am.

8
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,482
You're welcome. God bless.

9
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:09,327
Hi!

10
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,061
Hey, lady.

11
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:13,564
"O god, why do you
cast us off forever?

12
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:14,532
Why does your anger smoke

13
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,001
against
the sheep of your pasture?

14
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:21,005
Remember your congregation,
which you acquired long ago,

15
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:24,075
which you redeemed to be
the tribe of your heritage."

16
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,447
Can I just...

17
00:02:32,284 --> 00:02:35,119
Sisters of mercy.

18
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,721
Who? Colleen?

19
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:41,192
No, we don't have
any sisters named that.

20
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:45,129
No, ma'am, I don't know.

21
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,065
Do you know which order?

22
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,600
Oh, yeah, then I
definitely don't know.

23
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:53,571
There are so many.
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,374
Oh, that's okay.

25
00:02:56,376 --> 00:03:00,211
Hope you find her.
God bless.

26
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,756
I think the people understand.

27
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:48,159
I'm a war president.

28
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,528
I hear the voices,
and I read the front page,

29
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,332
and I know the speculation,
but I'm the decider.

30
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,367
But I'm the decider.

31
00:03:56,369 --> 00:04:02,040
And I ask you whether you
recall the title of that PDB.

32
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,441
I believe the title was

33
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:09,080
<i>bin laden determined to attack
inside the United States.</i>

34
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:13,117
You know that, that old
beach boys song<i> Barbara Ann?</i>

35
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,552
We're going to do
what we have to do

36
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,654
to protect
the United States of America.

37
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,256
The message
of these brave men and women

38
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:22,827
who are serving over there
is "let us win."

39
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,064
And night fell
on a different world,

40
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:29,801
on a world where freedom itself
is under attack.

41
00:04:48,253 --> 00:04:49,287
Sorry.

42
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,189
You're Debbie's friend.

43
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:51,622
Yeah.

44
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,225
You're the nun.

45
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:54,792
Um, yeah...

46
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:59,530
So, you, like, devoted your life
to Christ and everything?

47
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:02,300
You did.

48
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,601
I thought the show
was really creative.

49
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,570
Thank you. That's all right.
I don't want to mess with you.

50
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:08,439
It's just I've never
seen one before.

51
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,842
I've never seen
a real live nun before.

52
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,210
It's okay.

53
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:12,677
Sorry.

54
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,446
Do you wanna do
some blow with us?

55
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,849
Oh, I can't.

56
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:18,716
Sorry. Thanks.

57
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,885
I have no idea
how you would get, like,

58
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:24,555
I don't know, like a record deal
or a record company

59
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:25,723
or any of that, but...

60
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,558
I just think like,
you're so talented,

61
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,429
and, and if you can,
then, and if you'd like to,

62
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:32,163
then you should,

63
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,399
you should share
your gift with the world.

64
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:37,502
I don't know.
I don't know.

65
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:41,772
Just that's what my parents
always told me.

66
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:47,278
The next
Manhattan-bound l train

67
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,383
will depart
in approximately 37 minutes.

68
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,239
Sorry.

69
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:23,381
Do you remember
what I said to you

70
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:27,952
when you first joined our order,
Joan of arc?

71
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,387
Mm-hmm.

72
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,556
Do you think I was right?

73
00:06:33,692 --> 00:06:35,893
No.

74
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,795
You think I was wrong.

75
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:43,734
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,976
You're very close
to your first vows,

77
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:57,682
and I'm having trouble believing
that you're really devoted...

78
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,383
I am devoted.

79
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,918
Sorry.

80
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:06,390
I don't want you
to not have fun.

81
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,226
You're young.
You should have fun.

82
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:10,761
But if this community
isn't offering you

83
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,331
enough fun already...

84
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,705
What's wrong?

85
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:30,414
Hey.

86
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,883
I like your sunglasses.

87
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:37,321
Thanks.

88
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:57,468
You want to borrow my car,
don't you?

89
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:02,106
For how long?

90
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:07,345
Um, I don't know.

91
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,346
Three or four days.

92
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:12,917
You must tell me a number
and stick with it.

93
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:20,491
It took god six days
to create the universe.

94
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:24,095
You should be able to get
your act together in five.

95
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:29,100
Okay.

96
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,869
Okay, five days.

97
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:36,774
Use the time wisely, sister.

98
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,778
Hello?

99
00:13:24,102 --> 00:13:25,736
Jacob?

100
00:13:30,675 --> 00:13:32,610
Hello?

101
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:05,703
<i>Starlings are
medium-sized passerines.</i>

102

105
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,322
Hi, dad.

106
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:35,866
You look great.

107
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,004
You smell a little weird.

108
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:47,745
You smell like always.

109
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,215
Oh, Chiclet!

110
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,851
The more things change, huh?

111
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,018
Hi!

112
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,753

Joani, get in here, now!

115

Hi, mom.

116
00:16:11,903 --> 00:16:14,271
Oh!

117
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:18,075
Oh, sweet pea.

118
00:16:19,177 --> 00:16:21,078
Oh, you're home.

119
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,946
Oh, you're home!

120
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:25,149
Sweet pea!

121
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,085
- Mmm!
- Oh!

122
00:16:29,053 --> 00:16:32,523
Look what the cat dragged in.

123
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:33,824
Hey, Colleen.

124
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,859
Hey, Tricia.

125
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:43,267
Did you, did you get my emails?

126
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:44,835
Uh, yeah.

127
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,302
Yeah?

128
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:49,206
Um, I'm on, um, medicine now.

129
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,141

130
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,010
That's good, mom.

Yeah.
I'm so happy you're home.

132

Did you see your brother?
Did you say hi?

133
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,152
I didn't know
he was home until...

134
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,121
Oh, I'm going to go,
I'm going to go get him.

135
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,222
No, you don't have to do that.

136
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,957
Yes, I'm going to go get him.

168
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:40,277
Yeah?

169
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,045
Your mom and I
are dropping Tricia off

170
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,313
and heading into the office.

171
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:46,683
Are you going to be okay here
by yourself?

172
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,618
Uh, yeah.

173
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:54,725
Hey, give your brother
some space, okay?

174
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,994
Okay.

175
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,529
<i>We love you, mama and papa!</i>

176
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,232
<i>We think that you're
the bee's knees!</i>

177
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,067
<i>We're happy you got married</i>

178
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:07,337
<i>and gave birth
to Colleen and me.</i>

179
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:11,341
<i>You help us with our homework.
You take us to the zoo.</i>

180
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,543
<i>And that's why
on this special day,</i>

181
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,179
<i>we're saying
happy anniversary to you!</i>

182
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,681
<i>We know you'll never leave us,</i>

183
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,416
<i>and we swear
on the stars above...</i>

184
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,752
<i>To be good for you forever</i>

185
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,086
<i>and give you all our love!</i>

186
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,255
Welcome wagon!

187
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:28,458
<i>Happy anniversary!</i>

188
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:33,030
Uh, hey, there.
Is Jacob home?

189
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:39,669
Uh, I don't think he's taking
any visitors right now.

190
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:43,640
Wait a second.
Shoot. Colleen?

191
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:45,175
Yeah.

192
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,677
Look at you, girl, all grown up!

193
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,713
Like a, like a librarian
or something.

194
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,215
I barely recognized you
without all the, uh, the,

195
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,051
you know, the Marilyn Manson
stuff on your face.

196
00:20:54,053 --> 00:21:00,390
It's like the ugly duckling has
turned into a beautiful swan.

197
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:07,531
So, uh, we should come back
a little later, then?

198
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,665
Jacob?

199
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,401
Who is it?

200
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,837
Uh...

201
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,206
It's your sister.

202
00:22:34,652 --> 00:22:36,720
Welcome home.

203
00:22:40,825 --> 00:22:42,425
Thanks.

204
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,662
You look different.

205
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:57,774
Is it okay to hug you?

206
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,376
Sure.

207
00:23:09,353 --> 00:23:10,654
I'm sorry.

208
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:14,324
Don't worry about it.

209
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,259
I love you.

210
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,736
Do you wanna hang out?

211
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,972
Not really.

212
00:24:10,648 --> 00:24:11,615
Emily.

213
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,650
Oh, my god. Colleen!

214
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:16,920
You should tell me
when you're back in town!

215
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,256
Well, it's an unexpected visit.

216
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:23,827
Oh, my god!
You're, like, a real nun now.

217
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,495
Almost.

218
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:29,699
Everybody's talking
about your brother.

219
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:32,836
His whole face, huh?

220
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:33,670
Mm-hmm.

221
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:34,971
I'm so sorry.

222
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,607
I had such a crush on him
in high school.

223
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:41,444
I was at my parents'
vacation house,

224
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:44,014
but they didn't actually say
I could be there,

225
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:48,585
so technically I was squatting.

226
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,455
Oh, wow.

227
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:56,526
Yeah, remember this place?

228
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,995
It looks exactly the same.

229
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:10,373
I'm gonna go take a shower,
wash off the granola.

230
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,509
Make yourself at home.

231
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,943
Okay.

232
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,065
I came into work,
and he was like,

233
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:38,335
"you're ugly,
and you have a bad personality,"

234
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:40,670
and so I hit him in the eyes.

235
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:44,941
And then he had to get surgery,
but that was his fault because...

236
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:48,478
Yeah, yeah,
and I had to listen to them

237
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,579
talk about how great they are

238
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:54,784
and, like, how they're
doing this artist residency

239
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:56,986
in Barcelona
and all these things.

240
00:25:56,988 --> 00:26:00,724
And that's annoying,
but then I realized...

241
00:26:06,764 --> 00:26:08,431
Wow.

242
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,936
I hope this is okay.

243
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,038
Whatever, dude.

244
00:26:18,142 --> 00:26:21,010
You sure you don't want one?

245
00:26:23,514 --> 00:26:25,048
Is that like a nun thing?

246
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:29,085
It's still a Colleen thing.

247
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,954
Wow.

248
00:26:32,923 --> 00:26:36,659
Do you still have your v-card?

249
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,795
Lifetime member.

250
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:43,733
How were we friends
in high school?

251
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:47,437
No one else liked us.

252
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,473
Oh, yeah.

253
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:53,443
So, why did you move home?

254
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:04,821
<i>We are here inside
the Findlay corp chicken farm.</i>

255
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:11,094
<i>Findlay slaughters thousands
of innocent birds every day.</i>

256
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:12,762
That's awful.

257
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:18,568
Yeah, so, I had to get out
of Michigan pretty fast.

258
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,103
Do Rick and Sherry know?

259
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:23,606
No, they just think
I'm a screw-up.

260
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:27,110
Whatever, it's fine.
We hardly even talk.

261
00:27:31,882 --> 00:27:34,751
Did you get arrested?

262
00:27:35,753 --> 00:27:37,720
Uh-uh.

263
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,889
Thank god.

264
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:46,863
You know the government
considers us terrorists?

265
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,865
You know what a terrorist is?

266
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:52,101
It's somebody who
actually does something.

267
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,102
People want to vote for change,

268
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:56,606
but they don't actually
want to do the changing.

269
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:57,774
I worked for Peta.

270
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:02,078
I went to the marches.
Nothing happened.

271
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,179
When I started doing this stuff,

272
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,014
then I could feel
something happening.

273
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:09,719
I could feel the difference
we were making.

274
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:14,157
If that makes me a terrorist,
then whatever.

275
00:28:17,928 --> 00:28:21,564
Some people need to be
terrorized sometimes.

276
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:23,500
<i>The latest jobs report is in</i>

277
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:26,769
<i>from the labor department,
and it does not look good.</i>

278
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:28,872
<i>The figures show
that American companies</i>

279
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,006
<i>are laying off employees</i>

280
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,975
<i>at the fastest rate
in five years,</i>

281
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:36,179
<i>with over 159,000 jobs lost
since September.</i>

282
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:41,551
Where you been?
Your father and I made dinner.

283
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,621
We had no idea
you'd be home so late.

284
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:46,723
I ran into Emily Rhoades.

285
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,892
Oh, well, you could've called.

286
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:52,862
We had no way
of getting in touch with you.

287
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:55,732
Uh, you haven't had a way
to get in touch with me

288
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:56,866
for like three years.

289
00:28:56,868 --> 00:29:00,203
Seriously?

290
00:29:04,775 --> 00:29:06,309
I'm sorry.

291
00:29:08,245 --> 00:29:10,613
I'll call next time.

292
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:13,950
There's some dessert
in the fridge.

293
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:42,845
Why is this door locked?

294
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,047
I'm getting dressed!

295
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:48,818
I don't like locked doors
in my house.

296
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,922
I'm putting my clothes on!

297
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,791
Okay, fine.

298
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:18,281
Are you okay?

299
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:19,682
Excuse me?

300
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:24,120
You seem maybe not okay.

301
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:27,957
I just didn't want you
to miss breakfast.

302
00:30:35,132 --> 00:30:36,265
Scrapple, kiddo?

303
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:37,800
No, no!

304
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:39,035
Oops.

305
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:39,669
No meat.

306
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,270
Mr. bacon greasy fingers!

307
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:46,275
It's barely meat!
Just eat around it.

308
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:51,648
So, I am gonna drop Tricia off
at David's farm.

309
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:55,718
Do you wanna come say hello?
He'd love to see you.

310
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,786
Terri, too.

311
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:59,022
I, um, I don't think so.

312
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:03,259
I, um, was hoping Jacob
and I could...

313
00:31:07,965 --> 00:31:10,366
Okay, yeah, sure,
that'd be fine.

314
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,870
Cool.

315
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,979
Take your pick!
Whatever you want!

316
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:23,746
Hi, uncle David!

317
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:28,951
Oh, look at you!
Aw! Scrawny little thing.

318
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:32,455
Don't they feed you
up in New York?

319
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:33,456
This place looks great!

320
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,024
- Yeah, you like it?
- Mm-hmm.

321
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:37,427
Terri always wanted
her own little herb farm,

322
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:39,729
so she's finally got it.

323
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,263
In the meantime,

324
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,932
I'm the one that has
to take care of this place.

325
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:46,469
But I did get to name the goats!

326
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,706
Shut up, Blanche!

327
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,174
She's my favorite.

328
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:53,342
Tricia,
why don't you take Colleen

329
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,744
on a little tour of the farm

330
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:58,748
because David and I have
some business to discuss.

331
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,717
Five minutes, sweet pea.

332
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:03,219
Okay. Okay.

333
00:32:04,221 --> 00:32:07,924
I think it's great you and Jacob
are still together.

334
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,859
Uh, thanks.

335
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:13,029
It's, um...

336
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,264
Yeah.

337
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,867
Don't my parents
drive you crazy?

338
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:20,470
Oh, they're not that bad.

339
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:23,172
At least they care.

340
00:32:24,174 --> 00:32:26,876
How long you been working here?

341
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:32,849
Ever since they got the place,
a couple years ago.

342
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:35,084
And then after your brother
got hurt,

343
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:38,054
I needed something
to keep me busy.

344
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,468
What's in there?

345
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,509
So, you just water everything
and feed the animals?

346
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:00,777
All kinds of stuff.

347
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:04,013
Um, collect the eggs
from the chickens.

348
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:05,081
Chickens?

349
00:33:13,824 --> 00:33:16,959
Did you know
they were cannibals?

350
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:17,360
No.

351
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:20,897
Yeah. The big ones peck
the little ones to death,

352
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:23,366
and then they eat them.

353
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:24,000
Wow.

354
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,435
You know, we're just playing

355
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:27,436
with some ice cream,

356
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:30,439
waiting for some
hot boys to come by.

357
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,810
We even tried on
some sexy outfits for them, too.

358
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:39,382
Meow.

359
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:41,217
Colleen?

360
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,888
Hey, wanna go for a walk?

361
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,224
Not really.

362
00:33:49,326 --> 00:33:51,093
Okay.

363
00:33:54,331 --> 00:33:59,101
<i>It vass a dark and stormy night.</i>

364
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:03,840
<i>I vant to suck your blood!</i>

365
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:06,876
<i>Go back
to your grave, Draculina!</i>

366
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:07,410
<i>Never!</i>

367
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:10,213
<i>Oh, yeah?
Then take this!</i>

368
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,981
<i>Hey, put that down!
Cut it out!</i>

369
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:16,485
<i>Where did you get this?
Where did you get this?</i>

370
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:17,954
<i>I borrowed it from Tyler.</i>

371
00:34:17,956 --> 00:34:20,990
<i>What's the rule in our house?</i>

372
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:23,259
<i>No guns allowed.</i>

373
00:34:33,136 --> 00:34:37,073
Hey, there, mister man.

374
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,476
Tricia, you don't have to.

375
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:44,013
Please, let me at least try.

376
00:34:52,589 --> 00:34:56,359
Mmm. My big strong hero.

377
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:57,426
Tricia.

378
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,997
You are. You are.

379
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:08,271
Please.

380
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:12,174
No, I want to see
how much you want me.

381
00:35:26,189 --> 00:35:28,224
I'm trying really hard
right now.

382
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:31,327
I know, I know.
I appreciate it.

383
00:35:33,697 --> 00:35:36,032
I love you.

384
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:40,169
I love you, too.

385
00:36:21,578 --> 00:36:23,980
Mom, where's the hair dryer?

386
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:26,282
In the middle drawer.

387
00:36:32,756 --> 00:36:34,123
Find it okay?

388
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,391
Yep.

389
00:37:19,169 --> 00:37:20,469
Hello?

390
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,812
Have a seat!

391
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:30,646
Colleen...

392
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:34,483
Have a seat, please!

393
00:39:59,496 --> 00:40:04,767
Uh, we'll just come back
another time.

394
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:10,773
See? There's no one out here.

395
00:40:23,653 --> 00:40:24,853
Ready?

396
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:26,722
Mm-hmm.

397
00:40:41,271 --> 00:40:44,373
How often do our parents
smoke pot?

398
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,575
All the time.

399
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:47,643
When did that start?

400
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,411
I don't think
it ever really stopped.

401
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:50,946
Um, maybe they cut back
when we were born,

402
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:54,850
but ever since you left,
they just totally don't care,

403
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:59,955
and with all my stuff
and Tricia...

404
00:41:00,924 --> 00:41:02,825
Well, you don't, do you?

405
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:07,596
Maybe a few times, in Iraq.

406
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:08,964
Hmm, what was it like?

407
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,833
It was okay.
I mean, it was kinda stupid,

408
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:16,639
but sometimes you have to
get stupid over there.

409
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:29,918
So, we do these, um,
field trips, um, across America

410
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,655
to do, like, community service
stuff, you know?

411
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:33,289
Mm-hmm.

412
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:34,690
Like, we did a lot
of home rebuilding

413
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,992
in Louisiana and Mississippi,
that sort of thing,

414
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,061
but this one month we went
to Charleston, south Carolina,

415
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:43,565
and we worked in a group home
for mentally disabled adults,

416
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:48,003
and I, um, I was assigned
to a woman named Ro-Ro,

417
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:52,074
and, um, um, she was really
so sweet and very funny.

418
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:56,612
She insisted on putting
her own makeup on every morning.

419
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:57,046
Mm-hmm.

420
00:41:57,048 --> 00:42:00,983
And, um, she was a midge...
She was a little person,

421
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:01,817
and she loved men.

422
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:04,486
That's all she ever
wanted to talk about,

423
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:05,921
and she'd just
go on and on about men,

424
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:08,857
and if I, if I put on the song
<i>achy breaky heart,</i>

425
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:09,758
she just lost it.

426
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,393
I've never seen someone so happy
in my whole life

427
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:14,096
than when Ro-Ro would listen
to<i> achy breaky heart,</i>

428
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:15,998
but one of the nuns,
sister Isadora,

429
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,333
she was assigned
to this patient,

430
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:20,002
this guy who ate everything,
literally everything.

431
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:20,903
He, um, had a disorder

432
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:22,538
where he'd put everything
in his mouth,

433
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,772
so you had to watch him
at all times,

434
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:25,107
even when he went
into the bathroom,

435
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,675
and so Isadora went
into the bathroom once,

436
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:31,647
and he sat on the toilet,
and he, um, he's taking a poop.

437
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:33,349
When he finishes,
after he finishes,

438
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:34,917
he reaches into the toilet,

439
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:38,354
and he pulls it out,
and he eats it.

440
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:39,855
Oh! Oh, man!

441
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:43,392
Isadora couldn't do anything.

442
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:47,096
She just puked
all over the floor.

443
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:51,100
And he walks over,
and he starts eating her puke!

444
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:55,070
I can't laugh.

445
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:58,874
Come on! We laughed
our butts off, and we're nuns.

446
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:00,509
Oh, my gosh, are you okay?

447
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:07,483
No, I can't laugh.
It's my lungs and the hiking.

448
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:16,658
You okay?

449
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,061
Yeah.

450
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,074
Are you monsters?

451
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:41,784
Yeah, we're monsters.

452
00:43:46,022 --> 00:43:53,829
Joan Marie peacock-Lunsford.

453
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:58,667
I sure could use some company
in this bathtub.

454
00:44:00,937 --> 00:44:05,808
Mr. green and I are gonna get
real lonely without you.

455
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:09,011
Okay, just a second
before I forget.

456
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:17,686
Calgon, take me away!

457
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:49,084
Um, so, there's, um, this,
a little green box

458
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:50,118
in, in our bathroom.

459
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:54,790
Do you know
what I'm talking about?

460
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:55,724
No.

461
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:56,859
You sure?

462
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:59,595
Okay.

463
00:44:59,597 --> 00:45:00,629
Oh.

464
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:01,063
Nice.

465
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:02,197
How about this one?

466
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,032
I think this one
is just so pretty.

467
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,234
It looks great on you.

468
00:45:05,236 --> 00:45:11,707
Yeah? The neckline's pretty.

469
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,809
I don't know.

470
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:16,011
Oh, uh, maybe
a little too short.

471
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:18,981
Let's put the first one back on.
That one looked great!

472
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:22,150
I'm gonna try it on.
Be right back.

473
00:45:24,787 --> 00:45:26,221
Help?

474
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,590
Hi, there.

475
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:31,026
Want some help with the zipper?

476
00:45:38,768 --> 00:45:41,904
It's stuck on a flower.

477
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:47,643
Colleen, do you believe in god?

478
00:45:48,578 --> 00:45:50,012
Mm-hmm.

479
00:45:53,616 --> 00:45:54,550
When I was little girl,

480
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:58,820
I used to watch out the back
of my trailer every night

481
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:02,257
and look at the cars
turn their lights off.

482
00:46:04,694 --> 00:46:08,730
And then I would say,
"good night, cars,"

483
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:12,968
like everything in the world
had a heart and a soul.

484
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:17,806
But that isn't true, is it?

485
00:46:23,012 --> 00:46:27,883
I've been trying so hard
to be happy.

486
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:32,220
Everybody's had such a bad time.

487
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:36,058
But I don't want to be on TV.

488
00:46:43,633 --> 00:46:44,166
Tricia, I...

489
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:47,836
I'm stuck here,
and I don't know what to do.

490
00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:10,692
Mother, you have a phone call.

491
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:11,193
Who is it?

492
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,161
I'll give you three guesses.

493
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:17,699
I'm just not quite ready
to come back yet.

494
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:21,069
Well, I just wish
you would've told me sooner.

495
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:23,972
Adelaide and Bernadette are
supposed to take some orphans

496
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:25,407
to six flags tomorrow.

497
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:28,377
I know. I'm sorry.

498
00:47:29,212 --> 00:47:31,880
Just a couple more days.

499
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:37,886
I hate this.

500
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:43,925
Hey!
What's the matter? Chicken?

501
00:47:45,728 --> 00:47:47,896
Fried chicken?

502
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:51,366
Give me your hands.

503
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:51,967
Why?

504
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:55,037
Jeez Louise,
just give me your hands.

505
00:48:09,185 --> 00:48:11,153
Are we praying?

506
00:48:14,757 --> 00:48:16,858
Something like that.

507
00:48:23,332 --> 00:48:25,701
See, this isn't so bad.

508
00:48:25,703 --> 00:48:27,302
People are looking.

509
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:28,070
Let them look.

510
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:31,373
You've got nothing
to be ashamed of.

511
00:48:35,378 --> 00:48:36,478
Excuse me, ma'am?

512
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,746
Yes, ma'am?

513
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,014
Do you guys sell yarn?

514
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:41,883
Um, yes, aisle four.

515
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:43,118
Thank you.

516
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:43,819
Excuse me.

517
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:46,455
Aren't you the young man
I read about in the newspaper,

518
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:48,123
the one burnt in the war?

519
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:50,792
Uh, yeah, that's me.

520
00:48:50,794 --> 00:48:51,460
Son, I want you to know

521
00:48:51,462 --> 00:48:54,996
everyone here
thinks of you as a real hero,

522
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:57,299
and I just,
I just think it's a shame

523
00:48:57,301 --> 00:49:00,302
you boys were wasted
on this stupid war.

524
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:02,337
So many wasted young lives.

525
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,506
Bet you thank
your lucky stars for Obama.

526
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:06,341
<i>Wave of murder which is sweeping</i>

527
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:10,312
<i>the eastern third of the nation
is being committed by creatures</i>

528
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:15,083
<i>who feast upon
the flesh of their victims.</i>

529
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:17,986
Hey, can I ask you something?

530
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:20,889
Mm-hmm.

531
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:22,190
When the bomb went off in Iraq,

532
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:26,328
did you think
you were gonna die?

533
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,531
Yeah, I knew I was going to die.

534
00:49:33,035 --> 00:49:35,303
What was it like?

535
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,238
You know how they say

536
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,307
that everything flashes
before your eyes?

537
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:42,177
Yeah, that doesn't happen.

538
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:43,044
But, I was, like,

539
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:46,014
suddenly totally okay
with my entire life,

540
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:48,150
and I sort of thought,
"I guess that's it,"

541
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:53,088
but there's no regrets
or anything.

542
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:58,560
You know who would like to hear
that story, I bet?

543
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:00,428
Millions of Americans.

544
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:05,200
Oh, mom told you about CNN?

545
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:06,067
Uh-huh.

546
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:10,238
I don't want to be
anybody's hero, Colleen.

547
00:50:13,376 --> 00:50:17,412
But, you kind of are.

548
00:50:18,948 --> 00:50:20,949
It's such a joke.

549
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:25,554
I didn't die.
That doesn't make me special.

550
00:50:25,556 --> 00:50:29,391
I just feel like a freak

551
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:31,493
and a loser.

552
00:50:45,341 --> 00:50:47,375
Welcome to the club.

553
00:51:06,295 --> 00:51:09,598
You guys going to watch
the debates tonight?

554
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,334
Probably not.

555
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:17,505
Sweet potato, you of all people.

556
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:19,174
Mom.

557
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:23,245
Why don't we just rent a movie
or something?

558
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:26,147
I'll see you later, sister.

559
00:51:27,183 --> 00:51:30,185
I'll be there in a minute,
brother.

560
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:42,631
Just can't seem to do
anything right.

561
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:48,036
Well, it's tough, mom.

562
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:56,912
Don't you care about the issues?

563
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:01,383
Do you ever think about
anything bigger than yourself?

564
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:06,321
Um, seriously?

565
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:09,424
That's not what I meant.

566
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:11,126
What did you mean?

567
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:20,235
Your dad and I
love you both so much.

568
00:52:21,203 --> 00:52:28,043
And, sweet pea,
I know you took our pot.

569
00:52:28,045 --> 00:52:30,245
And it's totally cool.

570
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:32,447
You're young.
You want to experiment.

571
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:35,583
We understand.
This is a natural part of life.

572
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:40,255
And you know what?
Dad and I are happy to share.

573
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:44,025
What's ours is yours.

574
00:52:49,398 --> 00:52:51,633
I flushed your drugs, mom.

575
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:52,701
Excuse me?

576
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:59,641
Don't you think you're taking
enough drugs already?

577
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:01,276
What did I do?

578
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,478
Do you really want me
to answer that?

579
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,081
Yes, yes, I do.

580
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:09,584
You're gonna have to put
the knife away.

581
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:22,230
I must be a terrible
disappointment to you,

582
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:26,434
but that's the way it is,
isn't it?

583
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:31,740
And you know what?
That's life.

584
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:34,342
I'm a disappointment to you,

585
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:40,648
and you are
a disappointment to me.

586
00:53:41,417 --> 00:53:44,552
I just wish
you'd grow up a little

587
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,054
and get over it already.

588
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:53,561
Really, mom?

589
00:53:54,797 --> 00:53:57,532
Maybe you'd understand
if you stuck around

590
00:53:57,534 --> 00:54:02,737
and dealt with your problems
for once in your life.

591
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,472
Mother...

592
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:08,576
I will try to correct
myself with the grace of god.

593
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:33,201
Oh, hey, Colleen.

594
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:35,603
Hey, sorry I didn't call.

595
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:39,574
Yeah, no, please,
don't worry about it.

596
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,543
Remember this guy?

597
00:54:41,545 --> 00:54:44,412
Hey, Emily.

598
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:47,348
Oh, hey, Jacob.

599
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:09,104
Thank you so much!

600
00:55:09,106 --> 00:55:13,208
Terri and I would never have
been able to sustain

601
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:16,678
so many wonderful years
of marriage

602
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,115
if it weren't
for our spectacular friends!

603
00:55:20,117 --> 00:55:20,815
Seriously, y'all.

604
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,751
You've let our funky
little family into your hearts,

605
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:27,622
and that has made
all the difference.

606
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:29,124
Now, let's party!

607
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,641
Really?

608
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:47,876
We're jealous of you.

609
00:55:47,878 --> 00:55:49,477
No, don't be.

610
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:52,514
Adoption really was the best
thing that ever happened to us.

611
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:56,251
And really, no parent knows
what they're going to get.

612
00:55:56,253 --> 00:55:57,552
Even if they're
not your real children,

613
00:55:57,554 --> 00:56:01,456
you really see yourself in them
as they get older.

614
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:02,857
And when they were younger,

615
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:05,160
they were always
at each other's throats,

616
00:56:05,162 --> 00:56:08,429
but now, now they're like
two peas in a pod.

617
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:10,732
They are so smart,
and they are so sweet.

618
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:14,269
And Troy, he loves
his little sister so much.

619
00:56:14,271 --> 00:56:16,838
And we, we are truly lucky.

620
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,540
Mm-hmm.

621
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:22,177
And it seems like yesterday
they were little puppies

622
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:24,779
chasing squirrels
in the backyard.

623
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:25,813
Yeah.

624
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:28,283
That's so great, you two.

625
00:56:28,285 --> 00:56:30,852
So, how's Chiclet?

626
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:32,887
Chiclet!

627
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:36,491
Chiclet... Is wonderful.

628
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:40,895
We cannot allow
Iran to get a nuclear weapon.

629
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,831
Not only would it
threaten Israel,

630
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:45,767
our strongest ally in the region

631
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:48,536
and one of our strongest allies
in the world,

632
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:51,439
but it would also
create a possibility

633
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:55,710
of nuclear weapons falling
into the hands of terrorists.

634
00:57:10,259 --> 00:57:11,859
<i>It's a nurse.</i>

635
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:14,229
<i>Do you like it?</i>

636
00:57:14,231 --> 00:57:16,898
<i>I thought you said
you wanted to be a doctor</i>

637
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,434
<i>when you grew up.</i>

638
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:22,770
<i>Then what do you want to be?</i>

639
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:26,641
<i>I don't know.</i>

640
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:28,476
<i>A scientist?</i>

641
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:29,577
<i>No.</i>

642
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,446
<i>An artist?</i>

643
00:57:32,781 --> 00:57:36,951
<i>You can be anything
you want to be, sweet pea.</i>

644
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:37,986
Okay, well, in honor

645
00:57:37,988 --> 00:57:40,288
of this three-year
high-school reunion,

646
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,958
I vote that we play
truth or dare!

647
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,427
Uh, or not.

648
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:47,795
Come on, brother.

649
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,597
I'll play!

650
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,266
Okay.

651
00:57:51,268 --> 00:57:53,334
I choose truth.

652
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:53,735
Hmm.

653
00:57:53,737 --> 00:57:57,872
What's the worst thing
you know about your parents?

654
00:57:57,874 --> 00:57:58,906
Both of them?

655
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:00,575
Either one.

656
00:58:03,045 --> 00:58:06,781
Oh. Oh, jeez...

657
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:08,583
Do I tell this story?

658
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:10,018
Yes, tell it!

659
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:10,652
Tell it.

660
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:15,590
Okay, okay, but you have to chug
a beer with me,

661
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:17,525
both of you.

662
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:19,627
Double dare.

663
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:20,928
Wow.

664
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,398
That's my very first beer.

665
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,365
Your first beer.

666
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:28,670
I mean, it is Heineken,
so it's barely beer.

667
00:58:31,408 --> 00:58:33,441
Okay.

668
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:36,511
Yes!

669
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:40,848
Milady.

670
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,787
Sir. Let's do it.

671
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:47,522
Well, no, wait.
Hold on. First...

672
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,690
Okay, I'll do it. I'll do it.

673
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,825
But first you have to tell
the story first.

674
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:51,926
That's the deal.

675
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:54,996
What? Yikes! Uh!

676
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:55,663
Okay!

677
00:58:55,665 --> 00:59:02,370
Okay, so, you guys remember
Askjeeves. Com, the website?

678
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,638
Mm-hmm.

679
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:07,842
Okay, when I was 12,

680
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:11,079
I wanted to look up something
on the Internet,

681
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:14,349
and I had to go upstairs
to my parents' bedroom,

682
00:59:14,351 --> 00:59:17,618
and my dad had stayed logged in
to his account,

683
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:23,458
and so I go on to Askjeeves,
and I'm typing my question,

684
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,660
and, like,
when you type your question,

685
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:29,530
then the last five things
that you've asked it come up,

686
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:33,935
and apparently,
my dad had asked it,

687
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:36,938
"where, near Asheville,
north Carolina,

688
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:40,908
can I find a BBW prostitute?"

689
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:43,444
Whew!

690
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:45,113
What's BBW?

691
00:59:45,115 --> 00:59:51,419
It is big, beautiful women.

692
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,721
He asked Jeeves that?

693
01:00:03,031 --> 01:00:04,632
To parents!

694
01:00:06,068 --> 01:00:07,969
To parents.

695
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:10,805
Okay, first is the candidacy.

696
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:11,806
No, wait. Hold on. No, wait.

697
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:13,775
First it's the applicancy,
and then,

698
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:18,446
and then it's
the candidatcy... candidacy.

699
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,782
Um, and then the novitiate.

700
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,884
I'm the novitiate.
That's me.

701
01:00:22,886 --> 01:00:25,853
But then you do permanent.
First, no, hold on.

702
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:29,724
The temporary vows,
and then it is the final vows,

703
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:33,694
and then you are a nun
forever and ever.

704
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:34,829
Did I get it?

705
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:36,564
Oh, my god.

706
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:41,569
Ooh, you are wasted.

707
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:44,605
How many of those have I had?

708
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:46,441
Two and a half.

709
01:00:59,655 --> 01:01:03,491
Last one.
You wanna split it?

710
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:04,792
Sure.

711
01:01:12,601 --> 01:01:14,769
Is your mom doing okay?

712
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:17,839
Mmm, who knows?

713
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:18,639
Not really.

714
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:21,042
She was acting happy
for a little while,

715
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:24,479
but it's tough.

716
01:01:24,481 --> 01:01:27,081
Jeez, yeah.

717
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:33,621
If my kid ran away
after I tried to off myself...

718
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:34,255
Sorry.

719
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:36,157
No, it's okay.

720
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:45,099
Can you see anything
behind those things?

721
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:47,635
Barely, but yeah.

722
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:51,172
Why don't you take them off?
It's nighttime, anyway.

723
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:53,941
Yeah, I'd rather not.

724
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:56,844
I dare you to take them off.

725
01:01:56,846 --> 01:01:59,747
You don't wanna see it.
It's not...

726
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:03,651
Maybe I do.

727
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:10,191
Look, your spit
has touched my mouth.

728
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:10,892
Mm-hmm.

729
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:13,127
I think we know
each other well enough, huh?

730
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:16,864
That's true, yeah.
I can't.

731
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:33,781
In high school, I wanted
to make out with you so hard.

732
01:03:39,214 --> 01:03:42,883
Now, this little number
we're very, very happy with.

733
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:48,255
It's mellow but lasts longer.
Perfect for the over-40 crowd.

734
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:53,995
And, uh, do you have anything
a little stronger?

735
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:57,398
That... Would be these guys.

736
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,065
Oh.

737
01:03:58,067 --> 01:03:59,934
Terri's little babies.

738
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:03,037
Mushrooms covered
in Mexican chocolate.

739
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:06,273
They'll really take you
south of the border.

740
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:07,775
Lover, you ready?

741
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:12,380
Yeah, yeah, just a second.
I'll meet you at the car, honey.

742
01:04:16,685 --> 01:04:17,952
I threw up!

743
01:04:25,193 --> 01:04:27,762
Hello?

744
01:04:27,764 --> 01:04:29,230
Guys?

745
01:04:32,334 --> 01:04:35,936
Do you want to roast
some pumpkin seeds?

746
01:04:58,126 --> 01:04:59,360
Hello?

747
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:08,002
Guys?

748
01:06:31,853 --> 01:06:33,387
Um...

749
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:36,824
I made a salad for lunch.

750
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,393
Do you want some?

751
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:41,395
Yeah, that'd be nice.

752
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:45,933
When do you have to go back?
Tomorrow?

753
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:51,038
Um, I was thinking
about leaving today actually.

754
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,174
Oh.

755
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:59,213
Do you think you could stay
maybe one more night?

756
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:01,482
I have a fun idea.

757
01:07:03,952 --> 01:07:05,486
How fun?

758
01:07:09,224 --> 01:07:11,058
Fun.

759
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:15,896
Sister Joan of arc,
I try to make it a habit

760
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:18,465
to raise my voice
only when necessary,

761
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:19,900
and it is not often

762
01:07:19,902 --> 01:07:22,102
that the occasion
calls for me to raise my voice,

763
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:25,906
but you are trying my Patience,
and on top of that,

764
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:27,908
you are still in possession
of my car,

765
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:30,211
a car which is needed
up here in New York,

766
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:31,412
in case you forgot.

767
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:41,155
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

768
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:42,423
She hung up.

769
01:07:42,425 --> 01:07:46,594
And one, two, three, four.
Uh-huh.

770
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:50,164
Uh-huh. That's it.

771
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:52,366
Okay, come on. Oh, yes!

772
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:54,969
Oh, yes. Here we go.

773
01:07:54,971 --> 01:07:56,904
And one, two, three, four!

774
01:07:56,906 --> 01:08:00,641
Happy family Halloween party!

775
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:02,243
Whoo!

776
01:08:15,223 --> 01:08:17,558
Thank you.

777
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:29,336
Awesome.

778
01:08:35,176 --> 01:08:36,310
Bring our family together

779
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:39,146
for this festive
Halloween night,

780
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:45,019
and for... For this food
that we are about to receive.

781
01:08:45,021 --> 01:08:47,021
Amen.

782
01:08:47,023 --> 01:08:48,222
Let's eat.

783
01:09:05,073 --> 01:09:07,308
This is awesome,

784
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:10,644
awesomely done,
I just want to say.

785
01:09:20,722 --> 01:09:22,056
Good.

786
01:09:38,273 --> 01:09:40,074
Just touch it.

787
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:06,200
Colleen!

788
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:07,634
Ah ha ha!

789
01:10:14,542 --> 01:10:17,344
Sweet pea.

790
01:10:17,346 --> 01:10:20,314
Everybody having a good time?

791
01:10:33,595 --> 01:10:36,163
Anyone else for seconds?

792
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:38,465
Um, sweet pea?

793
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:42,603
It's her last night.
Let her indulge.

794
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:45,472
You wanna split one?

795
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:46,707
Sure!

796
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:49,810
Don't mind if I do.

797
01:11:04,125 --> 01:11:09,096
Mom, how much wine
did you put in that pasta?

798
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:12,366
Oh, not a lot.

799
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:13,534
I am such a lightweight.

800
01:11:13,536 --> 01:11:17,071
Wait, doesn't the heat
cook out all the alcohol?

801
01:11:17,073 --> 01:11:22,643
Yeah, you're right.
My fingers are a little tingly.

802
01:11:25,113 --> 01:11:31,552
What did you put
in the cupcakes, mom?

803
01:11:31,554 --> 01:11:32,186
Mom?

804
01:11:32,188 --> 01:11:35,756
Colleen, it's your last night.

805
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:41,228
I just wanted us to all relax
and have fun, you know,

806
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:42,496
like a family.

807
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:43,797
Why would you...

808
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:47,101
What is wrong with you?

809
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:02,817
Sweet pea!

810
01:12:05,688 --> 01:12:09,690
Sweet pea, please open up!

811
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:12,726
Colleen Noel Lunsford,
this isn't funny!

812
01:12:30,645 --> 01:12:34,148
You knew about the key
under the gargoyle?

813
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:38,719
I always knew
about the gargoyle key.

814
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:49,763
So, is it okay if I sit down?

815
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:51,265
Fine.

816
01:13:13,755 --> 01:13:15,656
Am I a bad mom?

817
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:22,196
That's not a fair question.

818
01:13:22,198 --> 01:13:24,898
Was I a bad mom?

819
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:34,408
I guess it's not your fault.

820
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:37,978
It was just a lot.

821
01:13:38,913 --> 01:13:44,418
First Jacob, then you.

822
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:49,356
I just, I just needed...

823
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:51,291
Structure.

824
01:13:54,729 --> 01:13:56,663
I'm sorry.

825
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:05,439
Yeah, me, too.

826
01:14:12,313 --> 01:14:16,283
Do you like being a nun?

827
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:19,853
Yeah, I do.

828
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:25,525
Do you ever wish
you could have a boyfriend?

829
01:14:28,329 --> 01:14:29,796
Girlfriend?

830
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:33,800
I don't think I'll ever want
to do that with anyone.

831
01:14:34,969 --> 01:14:41,508
Hmm. When you were growing up,
your dad and I used to think

832
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:46,680
you'd become a lesbian satanist.

833
01:14:53,921 --> 01:14:57,691
Sometimes I think
you're sad I'm not.

834
01:15:03,931 --> 01:15:06,667
Colleen, when I was your age,

835
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:11,638
I thought having a kid
would make me an adult,

836
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:15,709
that it was going to give me
some kind of purpose,

837
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:18,412
some sense of direction,

838
01:15:18,414 --> 01:15:24,818
but, um, it didn't, not really.

839
01:15:28,556 --> 01:15:33,026
And neither did
having another one.

840
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:35,028
And, um, I got older,

841
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:38,899
and there was
more and more responsibility,

842
01:15:38,901 --> 01:15:40,567
and then
that just never went away,

843
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:46,073
and it got harder
and harder, and...

844
01:15:46,075 --> 01:15:48,442
And, um...

845
01:15:48,444 --> 01:15:54,114
I found myself
becoming very sad.

846
01:15:55,883 --> 01:15:59,086
And when I was at my saddest,

847
01:15:59,088 --> 01:16:06,560
I just wanted to go to sleep
and not wake up,

848
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:09,429
just sleep.

849
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:11,098
And that didn't happen either.

850
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:12,132
No matter how hard I tried,

851
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:18,572
I just kept waking up
and waking up and waking up.

852
01:16:20,141 --> 01:16:23,610
And then I tried
something different.

853
01:16:26,681 --> 01:16:29,683
I didn't get that moment,
Colleen,

854
01:16:29,685 --> 01:16:32,152
where everything
was just suddenly okay.

855
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:37,057
I don't think
those moments exist.

856
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:42,996
I think all you can do
is keep trying

857
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:50,470
and hope that somehow trying
can be good enough.

858
01:16:56,979 --> 01:16:59,613
It's good to talk, right?

859
01:17:03,684 --> 01:17:06,119
Can we be friends?

860
01:17:07,989 --> 01:17:12,826
Yeah, mom, we can be friends.

861
01:17:18,065 --> 01:17:19,833
Is it always this fun
to be stoned?

862
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:24,070
<i>You're expecting a mere handsaw</i>

863
01:17:24,072 --> 01:17:27,707
<i>and a covered wooden casket?</i>

864
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:31,745
<i>Oh, no.
That's the old-fashioned way</i>

865
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:34,514
<i>of sawing people in half.</i>

866
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:38,919
<i>Today, magicians
are mechanized tools,</i>

867
01:17:38,921 --> 01:17:46,921
<i>and nothing will be concealed
from your view!</i>

868
01:17:57,473 --> 01:17:58,972
Ew!

869
01:18:06,681 --> 01:18:12,185
Oh, this isn't scary.
It's just horrible.

870
01:18:17,692 --> 01:18:18,992
Aah!

871
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:23,530
They're coming to get you,
Barbara!

872
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:24,532
Stop it.

873
01:18:26,235 --> 01:18:27,235
Shh!

874
01:18:35,743 --> 01:18:37,244
What do we do?

875
01:18:37,246 --> 01:18:39,045
What do we do?

876
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:40,213
Answer it.

877
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:41,214
What if it's the cops?

878
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:42,749
How could it possibly
be the cops?

879
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:44,651
How could it
possibly not be the cops?

880
01:18:44,653 --> 01:18:47,153
If it's not the cops,
then who is it?

881
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:56,563
Okay, rock-paper-scissors
for who answers the door.

882
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,798
One, two, three.

883
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:16,116
Ah! Jacob!

884
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:19,219
Mom, dad, wake up!

885
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:21,855
Animal liberations
has taken Jacob!

886
01:19:26,562 --> 01:19:27,894
Close the door!

887
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:33,800
I'll get my keys.

888
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:35,302
Come on!

889
01:19:36,837 --> 01:19:38,238
Oh, my gosh, Tricia.
I'm so sorry.

890
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,139
This is all my fault.

891
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:40,340
None of this would have
happened if i...

892
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:41,841
I shouldn't have come home.

893
01:19:41,843 --> 01:19:42,843
Honk at them!

894
01:19:43,879 --> 01:19:44,611
Honk louder!

895
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,012
I can't drive and honk
at the same time!

896
01:19:46,014 --> 01:19:47,280
Hurry up!
They're getting away!

897
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:49,015
Oh, god! What do you think
they're gonna do to him?

898
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:50,016
I'm trying! I'm trying!

899
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:51,952
I didn't want him to go away.
I'm sorry for everything

900
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:54,220
I've ever said or done
that's bad ever.

901
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:55,155
Tricia, it's okay.

902
01:19:55,157 --> 01:19:57,791
Everybody in the whole world
thinks bad things sometimes.

903
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,893
It's gonna be okay.

904
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:02,162
Oh, no. That is not good.

905
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:03,063
What?

906
01:20:03,065 --> 01:20:05,031
Uh, nothing.

907
01:20:10,172 --> 01:20:14,240
Some people need
to be terrorized sometimes.

908
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:15,375
Watch out! Watch out!

909
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:17,010
Watch out!

910
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:22,882
"Oh, Sally,
you left me down the stairs.

911
01:20:22,884 --> 01:20:25,118
I'm coming up them!"

912
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:29,823
And then a few hours later,
the doll said again,

913
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:33,860
"Sally, I'm in your room!"

914
01:20:33,862 --> 01:20:35,962
Sally got really, really scared.

915
01:20:35,964 --> 01:20:36,863
She pulled the covers up

916
01:20:36,865 --> 01:20:39,699
and, and put a pillow
on her face.

917
01:20:39,701 --> 01:20:43,370
Then, then the doll said again,

918
01:20:43,372 --> 01:20:46,272
"oh, Sally,
I'm right next to you!"

919
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:48,908
Then the light
turned on suddenly,

920
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:51,911
and she saw the doll,
and the doll killed her,

921
01:20:51,913 --> 01:20:56,883
and every single time
the doll kills a person,

922
01:20:56,885 --> 01:20:57,984
she puts up one finger,

923
01:20:57,986 --> 01:21:02,155
and if she runs out of fingers,
she grows more.

924
01:21:02,157 --> 01:21:07,427
And no one knows
where the doll is now.

925
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:12,699
Tricia.

926
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:14,734
Yeah, Colleen?

927
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:16,202
Are you alive?

928
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:18,338
I think so.

929
01:21:24,712 --> 01:21:27,247
Let's get out of the car.

930
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:27,947
Okay.

931
01:21:27,949 --> 01:21:30,850
Soldier! Soldier! Soldier!

932
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:33,453
Soldier! Soldier! Soldier!

933
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:36,256
Soldier! Soldier!
Soldier!

934
01:21:36,258 --> 01:21:38,124
Soldier! Soldier! Soldier!

935
01:21:38,126 --> 01:21:40,727
Soldier! Soldier!
Soldier!

936
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:46,032
Shoot, dog, we missed your ass!

937
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:47,734
Didn't mean
to snatch you up like that

938
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:52,439
but f-u-n doesn't
take n-o for an answer!

939
01:21:52,441 --> 01:21:53,306
Whoo!

940
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:58,778
And we got you a little
welcome back surprise, soldier!

941
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:00,814
Whoo!

942
01:22:00,816 --> 01:22:03,116
There we go!

943
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:10,757
Welcome home, corporal Lunsford!

944
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:15,762
Whoo!

945
01:22:24,171 --> 01:22:26,172
Yeah, baby, shake that.

946
01:22:28,844 --> 01:22:29,909
Jacob!

947
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:37,450
No!

948
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:38,384
Jacob!

949
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:40,019
No, Jacob!

950
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:41,521
Are you okay?

951
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:43,857
What?

952
01:22:43,859 --> 01:22:44,991
Jacob?

953
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:48,094
Call an ambulance!
He can't breathe!

954
01:23:03,477 --> 01:23:04,978
Thanks.

955
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:09,115
Sure thing, sugar pie.

956
01:23:19,326 --> 01:23:23,797
Can I ask you a weird question?

957
01:23:23,799 --> 01:23:26,366
Ask away, angel.

958
01:23:26,368 --> 01:23:29,836
Do your parents
know what you do?

959
01:23:32,907 --> 01:23:34,874
Sure do.

960
01:23:34,876 --> 01:23:39,913
Can't say they're
happy about it, but...

961
01:23:39,915 --> 01:23:43,283
We all gotta pay
our bills, right?

962
01:23:43,285 --> 01:23:45,285
Yeah.

963
01:23:46,887 --> 01:23:50,423
Plus, I know
they can't talk, anyway.

964
01:23:50,425 --> 01:23:53,827
We're all screw-ups.

965
01:23:53,829 --> 01:23:56,830
I guess that's why
we love each other.

966
01:23:56,832 --> 01:23:59,199
He's in stable condition.

967
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:00,200
He's going to be okay,

968
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:02,335
but we'll need to keep him
for a week or so

969
01:24:02,337 --> 01:24:03,403
to monitor him.

970
01:24:03,405 --> 01:24:06,072
Thank you so much.
We really appreciate it.

971
01:24:06,074 --> 01:24:08,908
He's a real hero
for pulling through this one.

972
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:13,012
We'll be sure
to tell him you said that.

973
01:24:14,148 --> 01:24:15,515
Thanks.

974
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:21,521
Okay, we'll take it from here.
Thank you so much.

975
01:24:21,523 --> 01:24:23,189
All right.

976
01:24:24,458 --> 01:24:26,860
Bless y'all.

977
01:24:26,862 --> 01:24:29,596
Call me if you need anything?

978
01:24:36,871 --> 01:24:38,371
Okay.

979
01:24:40,274 --> 01:24:42,141
All good.

980
01:24:49,617 --> 01:24:51,985
I'm sorry, dad.

981
01:24:55,389 --> 01:24:58,224
It's gonna be okay, sweet pea.

982
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:11,404
I'm gonna miss you guys a lot.

983
01:25:12,506 --> 01:25:16,175
You can come visit us anytime.

984
01:25:17,578 --> 01:25:19,345
You, too.

985
01:25:25,386 --> 01:25:27,520
It's been a long time coming,

986
01:25:27,522 --> 01:25:32,025
but tonight, because
of what we did on this day,

987
01:25:32,027 --> 01:25:36,396
in this election,
at this defining moment,

988
01:25:36,398 --> 01:25:38,631
change has come to America!

989
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:53,613
What do you ask
of this community?

990
01:25:53,615 --> 01:25:57,984
I ask to be
a fully incorporated member.

991
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:02,655
God of mercy and compassion,

992
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:06,726
I celebrate your faithfulness
and love for me,

993
01:26:06,728 --> 01:26:08,728
and I praise your name.

994
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:12,165
In Thanksgiving
for this gift of my vocation,

995
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:19,138
I vow to live a life of poverty,
chastity, and obedience,

996
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:23,676
and to persevere
in this community until death.

997
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:13,292
Lord, bless these rings
which we bless in your name.

998
01:27:13,294 --> 01:27:14,494
Grant that those who wear them

999
01:27:14,496 --> 01:27:18,164
may always have a deep faith
in each other.

1000
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:21,667
May they do your will
and always live together

1001
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:25,038
in peace, goodwill, and love.

1002
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:29,175
We ask this
through Christ, our lord.

1003
01:27:31,745 --> 01:27:35,048
With this ring,

1004
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:38,117
I make you my wife.

1005
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:44,223
And with this ring,
I make you my husband.

1006
01:27:48,729 --> 01:27:49,729
All right!
