1
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,610
Oh I'm very sorry, I didn't notice...

2
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,840
It's been 20 years since we've had people visit, but I hope you'll enjoy your stay.

3
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:44,980
I also noticed, you won't be needing any help with luggage?

4
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,860
Observant and caring, your wife is a lucky lady.

5
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:51,610
Yes.

6
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,380
As long you think so.

7
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,640
Shin, my daughter is preparing dinner.

8
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,250
It will be ready soon in the dining room.

9
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,190
I can't believe that!

10
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,340
Sorry!

11
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,810
Come out and play my children.

12
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,360
The feeding season has begun.

13
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,560
Can you sense her?


14
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:12,480
What happened?

15
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,620
The right thing?

16
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:52,650
I used to know right from wrong.

17
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:56,290
Life used to feel right.

18
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:01,400
Kato raised me in the mountain village.

19
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,150
That I called home.

20
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,800
But I found the only friend in my life.

21
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,970
Happiness and love was within reach.

22
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:51,590
But then the dark dream came.

23
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:58,370
In the dream, I killed him.

24
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:02,140
Love was gone, replaced by blood.

25
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:04,360
Saya-sama!

26
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:10,000
Then I woke up, and it was not a dream.

27
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:53,780
Please take your father's sword.

28
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,340
I don't understand...

29
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:02,510
This sword...

30
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:07,430
has the power to slay demons.

31
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:11,960
It is a blessing, and a curse.

32
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:15,110
You still have much to learn...

33
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:19,670
However...

34
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:21,430
We have no more time!

35
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:25,540
The demons have found us!

36
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,440
Kato...

37
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,440
Kato

38
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:37,130
Wait here...

39
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:38,920
And don't come out!

40
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:57,510
I told you not to follow!

41
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:59,540
But we need to stick together-

42
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,740
We mustn't!

43
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:03,480
Kato...

44
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,590
There is no need, I must go alone.

45
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,320
You...

46
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:13,120
Just what are you planning?

47
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:22,060
I must complete my mission.

48
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,710
You can't, Kato!

49
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:28,130
You cannot face the demons yet.

50
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:30,240
It is my task for now.

51
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,870
Now, go!


52
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:36,410
Why are you still standing there?!
