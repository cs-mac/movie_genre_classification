2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,300
Then I guess you won't care.

3
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,120
Gol Sa will die by my hand.

4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,780
You must have heard the rumors about
the end of Seosumun's Six Ghost.

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,410
<i>[Episode 13]</i>
It was me who crushed Six Ghost.

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,410
Baek Dae Gil.

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,890
It was you.

8
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,260
You wore Scholar Baek Myun's mask.

9
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,890
And you broke down the gambling rooms
in the eight cities?

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,830
Why? Does that change your mind?

11
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,690
No, you're wasting your time.

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,380
No matter how hard you try,
you will never get to him.

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,440
Yi In Jwa is--

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,290
I know Yi In Jwa better than you do.

15
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,020
I've already fought him many times
and lost many times.

16
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,420
Then why do it again?

17
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,880
Because I have to face him.

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,070
If it is not me, nothing will change.

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,150
I know how you feel in wanting
to save your father.

20
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,780
But you won't be able to do that by
sitting there like that.

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,360
Just know this.

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,550
If you don't make a move,
nothing will change.

23
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,130
Nothing...

24
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,540
Oh, this is nice.

25
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,870
I had a good time.

26
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,940
Seol Im.

27
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,680
Baek Ho Dae Sal...

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,250
Of all the horoscopes,
it is the most atrocious one.

29
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,800
You have only two choices.

30
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,720
One is to leave here
and live your life out alone.

31
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,310
This is the easiest method since your
bad omen will not reach any others.

32
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:13,710
The other method is to
kill the person you love.

33
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,750
What is it? Did something happen?

34
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,080
No, not at all.

35
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,260
That child of his was a girl.

36
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,810
What?

37
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,870
It was a girl.

38
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,460
Gol Sa's child...

39
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,410
Oh.

40
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,150
Are you feeling unsure now that
you've met with Baek Dae Gil?

41
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,590
That is understandable.

42
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,110
Should I tell you a fun story?

43
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,530
The horoscope Baek Dae Gil was born with
has the calling of a monarch.

44
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,930
You have knowledge of horoscopes.

45
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,740
You must have no problem understanding
the meaning of my words.

46
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,710
<i>What happened?</i>

47
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,320
I tried to persuade her
but I cannot guarantee anything.

48
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,080
She became a hostage on her own
to protect her father.

49
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,130
I can understand
her devotion to her father--

50
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,410
No.

51
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:46,610
She was never a part of my plan
to get to Gol Sa.

52
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,500
I will go after Gol Sa, regardless.

53
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,620
We will get Gol Sa tomorrow.

54
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,460
He is quite powerful. It won't be easy.

55
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,570
That's true. Will you be okay?

56
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,920
It won't difficult with your help.

57
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,030
Me?

58
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,660
You said you wanted
something out of this.

59
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,530
I needed the accounting books because of
the license ban on the small merchants.

60
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,760
What? Did you think
you'd get it for free?

61
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,350
Well, how can I help?

62
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,270
Get the Office of the Inspector General
to take care of the troops under Gol Sa.

63
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,170
Then I can play a round with Gol Sa.

64
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:34,480
That... will be a problem.

65
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,840
After we got rid of Six Ghost,
I was removed from office.

66
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,650
As for position and rank...
my name has been removed.

67
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,070
But I have other methods.

68
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,950
Do you have confidence?

69
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,290
Tomorrow, 3 to 5 p.m. Don't be late.

70
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,070
I'll be going, then.

71
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,510
I will get going too.

72
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,020
Cutter will be waiting for me.

73
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,030
You'll come back, right?

74
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,900
Don't get hurt.

75
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,320
Tomorrow, 3 to 5 p.m.?

76
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,650
<i>[Cutter] </i>

77
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,950
Thank you for helping me
and keeping me safe all this time.

78
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,980
Will you be leaving?

79
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,740
It is very late now. Leave tomorrow.

80
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,120
Please help me!

81
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,300
If you help me, my life will be--

82
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,570
Your life!

83
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,720
Do not give it up so easily.

84
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,870
It is not worth so little.

85
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,130
<i>Baek Dae Gil...</i>

86
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,730
Baek Dae Gil met that girl.

87
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,230
South Goblin did come by
the gambling room today.

88
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,720
I did think it was a little odd.

89
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,940
He was probably looking for
Gol Sa's child.

90
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,490
So...

91
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,530
I got involved to make sure that
it would not impact you negatively.

92
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:45,930
She is a smart child,
so she will not be rash.

93
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,420
Moo Myung, you watch over her.

94
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,220
Yes, my lord.

95
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,390
What are you writing?

96
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:09,300
I will come for Gol Sa today
between 3 to 5 p.m., so wait for me...

97
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,730
Baek Dae Gil.

98
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,910
Once I have finished writing this,
put it up all over Hanyang.

99
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:24,160
<i>Bukcheon, markets, streets,
Jongno, and Mapo too.</i>

100
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,240
- Wow, What a bad guy!
- Baek Dae Gil?

101
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,550
<i>[Choi Yi Seok]</i>
He must be awful!

102
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:39,170
<i>Isn't Gol Sa the gambler in Mapo?</i>

103
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:42,360
He's not just a gambler.

104
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,420
He controls the waterways in Mapo.

105
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,760
He is also a craftsman for
Yi In Jwa and the other merchants.

106
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,940
If he is taken down,
it will be a blow to our Soron faction.

107
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,470
Bring in Yi In Jwa right now.

108
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,510
Oh my...

109
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,310
Here he is now.

110
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,200
My lord!

111
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,890
<i>[Kim Chang Jib]</i>

112
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:36,550
Your Highness, did you know what
this Baek Dae Gil was up to?

113
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,440
Regardless of what Baek Dae Gil does...

114
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,630
I am going after Yi In Jwa myself.

115
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,410
Yi In Jwa!

116
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,440
What about abolishing the license ban
on the small merchants?

117
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,530
Was that to get Yi In Jwa, as well?

118
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,190
Yes.

119
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:03,300
To stop Yi In Jwa, we must stop the
corruption with the large merchants.

120
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,280
And in order to do that,
I need that accounting book.

121
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:13,470
That accounting book is in
Gol Sa's hands at this moment.

122
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,530
You want to get that accounting book,
abolish the license ban

123
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,110
and cut off Yi In Jwa's money?

124
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
By any chance...

125
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,610
Even if you catch one gambler

126
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,170
do you think a rat like Yi In Jwa
would even blink?

127
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,310
No.

128
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,640
Gol Sa is not someone
you should overlook like that.

129
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,530
Is Mapo not the most prosperous place
in all of Joseon?

130
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,910
The master is passing by!

131
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:51,520
<i>It is Gol Sa who controls all of the
rights of commerce to Mapo.</i>

132
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:59,250
<i>Products in Mapo cannot be shipped on a
boat without Gol Sa's permission.</i>

133
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,290
<i>However...</i>

134
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:07,040
<i>officials who should be controlling him
are too friendly with him.</i>

135
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,270
<i>So, we can do nothing but stand idly by.</i>

136
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,170
Because of that...

137
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,840
I need you to help me.

138
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,650
I will get the help of
Hansung Regional Office.

139
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,340
However, I have a condition.

140
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:43,360
If I get aid from them,
give the accounting books to me.

141
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,580
I want you to step away from this,
Your Highness.

142
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,160
Leave the rest of the work to me.

143
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,960
<i>It seems he has a
deep relationship with Yeoning.</i>

144
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,930
Who is this Baek Dae Gil?

145
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,590
He is the pupil of former
military trainer Kim Chae Gun.

146
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,410
Do you all remember the assassination
plot the king set up two years ago?

147
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:24,720
<i>That night the king gave him a sword.</i>

148
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,550
But why is he going around
attacking the gambling rooms?

149
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,710
Also, why is Yeoning with him?

150
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,960
It is a long story so I cannot
tell you everything, but do not worry.

151
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,190
It is all in the palm of my hand.

152
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,330
<i>[Choi Sukbin]</i>

153
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,260
It is Baek Dae Gil.

154
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:16,400
It seems the two of them are gnashing
their teeth to get at Yi In Jwa.

155
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:21,290
It looks very dangerous to me.

156
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:28,130
I am asking you if it
seems all right to you.

157
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,280
What are you trying to say, Your Majesty?

158
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,200
The two of them do not even know
that they are brothers.

159
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:39,570
What will you do if something goes awry
and they draw swords at each other?

160
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,220
Untie the knot.

161
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,620
If you cannot untie it, cut it off.

162
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:55,560
This history came to be because you are
the mother of both these boys.

163
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,330
Your Highness! Your Highness!

164
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,710
<i>[Hansung Regional Office]</i>

165
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,110
<i>I will get the help of
Hansung Regional Office.</i>

166
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,640
How many personnel do you have here?

167
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,960
<i>[Mapo]</i>

168
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,700
Hey!

169
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,980
What time is it now?

170
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:50,630
I have an important appointment today.

171
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,040
- Get him!
- Get him!

172
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,600
- Arrest them all!
- Yes, sir!

173
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,640
What's the Hansung Regional Office
doing here?

174
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,020
Your Highness.

175
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,940
Are you not ashamed as an official
who gets paid by the nation?

176
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,320
Arrest these men.

177
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,450
Go to the shipping department
and seize all documents!

178
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,560
Yes, sir!

179
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,320
<i>I've set up the game for you.
The rest is up to you.</i>

180
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,000
Enter!

181
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,980
You're right on time.

182
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,760
I feel like a king
being welcomed like this.

183
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,920
What? This is nothing.

184
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,140
Hey, now. Why are you
treating a guest this way?

185
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,530
Dominoes.
Newly minted ones from the start?

186
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,690
I'm getting a taste.

187
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,100
I know you have some skills.

188
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,000
You know the rules, right?

189
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,560
I do know, but...

190
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,640
I'll letting you off
because it's the first game.

191
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,720
This side was made with iron.

192
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,770
This side was made with ivory.

193
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:02,540
The cost is double
and it feels different too.

194
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,720
You noticed it, did you?

195
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,380
This gambling room is interesting.

196
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:35,800
Three empress tree wood
and one oak tree wood.

197
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,200
And...

198
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,240
one that only comes out "yut."

199
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,330
A card with a wire in it.

200
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,120
What is this?

201
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,320
This entire place is rigged.

202
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,880
Well, should I reveal more?

203
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,980
That's enough now.

204
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,040
I've seen enough of your skills now.

205
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,060
Play for real.

206
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,830
Check it.

207
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,120
The weight is right,
the texture is right

208
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,640
and there are no marks on them.

209
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,810
They're good.

210
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:10,350
Then, let's play for real.

211
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,140
Why did you hang up those posters?

212
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,130
I did become famous thanks to you,
so it was nice.

213
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,310
Didn't you do that to catch me?

214
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,710
Why would I?

215
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,140
Are you playing innocent now?

216
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,160
So, it wasn't you
who put up those posters?

217
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,690
Let's go over the rules.

218
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,780
A pair of tens is the best hand.

219
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,260
And no tricks or
rigging cards allowed, of course.

220
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,120
There is one unique rule we have
in the Mapo gambling room.

221
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,060
Stealing a card.

222
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,280
Stealing a card?

223
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,370
Before players reveal their cards

224
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,290
they can switch one card
with their opponent.

225
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,890
You can switch cards with each other?

226
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,540
Best out of three rounds!

227
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,450
Deal the cards.

228
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,450
I won't switch.

229
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,900
I will...

230
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,120
I have a bad feeling about yours.

231
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,510
I'll just go with what I have too.

232
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,900
Then, let's show our cards.

233
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,210
What are you doing? Show your cards.

234
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,280
I lose. Deal the cards.

235
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,710
<i>You'll lose that round to me. Is that it?</i>

236
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,520
If it's best out of three rounds,
I only need to win one more.

237
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,540
Don't act so tough.

238
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,190
You don't know how life ends up
until the bell rings.

239
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,300
You don't know how a game will end
until you leave the table.

240
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:51,200
That's how Six Ghost acted
before he ended up in a fiery hell.

241
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,470
I'll deal this time.

242
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:02,270
<i>Are you going to show me your skills now?</i>

243
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,600
Switch well this time.

244
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:36,670
This one here smells like a 10.

245
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,980
You'll have to see it to know
if it's a 10 or crap.

246
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,360
It's your turn.

247
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,330
I'm fine. Let's show our cards.

248
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,420
Then, mine first.

249
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:57,180
This is the one I got from you.

250
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:03,350
I have a pair of twos!

251
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,500
What are you doing? Show yours.

252
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,110
<i>He's not being shaken.</i>

253
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,590
You have a zero.

254
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,710
<i>I had a two and a seven.</i>

255
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,130
<i>Gol Sa had a two and a three.</i>

256
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,560
How did he know?

257
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,550
This is the last game.

258
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:15,720
Have you ever lost playing cards before?

259
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,660
I've played for 30 years.

260
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,150
There was that one time.

261
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,400
To Cutter...

262
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,460
Then today is your second time.

263
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,440
Good thing I'm not late.

264
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,090
What brings you here again,
Scholar Baek Myun?

265
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:22,110
I wanted to give you strength,
so I brought you a gift.

266
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,240
Yeon Hwa!

267
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:34,810
Father.

268
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,410
What are you up to now?

269
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,000
I have to do this so that your
true abilities will come out.

270
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,910
What's your reason?

271
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,680
What's your reason for posting
my name all over town?

272
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,790
I'm sure you received some
hospitality thanks to me.

273
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,090
The game is just starting to get serious.

274
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:05,130
Go on and deal the cards.

275
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:28,530
I will deal the cards.

276
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:36,560
How can we be sure that Baek Dae Gil
will not use tricks?

277
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,150
What are you up to?

278
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:46,230
It makes sense that
she wants her father to win.

279
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,550
Go ahead.

280
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,050
<i>Father.</i>

281
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,280
10.

282
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,080
Five.

283
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,180
How did you know?

284
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,090
I don't think it's a trick.

285
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,320
It's the sound.

286
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:11,670
Every card has a different sound.

287
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,960
<i>Sound? Is this game rigged?</i>

288
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,170
<i>Three.</i>

289
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,880
<i>Two.</i>

290
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:30,420
<i>Three. A pair of threes.</i>

291
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,250
<i>Seven.</i>

292
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,730
<i>Cards totaling nine.</i>

293
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,010
<i>Father has two threes.</i>

294
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,590
<i>That's a pair of threes.</i>

295
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,290
<i>Baek Dae Gil has a seven and two.</i>

296
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,420
<i>That totals nine.</i>

297
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,840
<i>If he chooses not to switch,
Father will win.</i>

298
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:58,810
I don't want to switch.

299
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,810
You can switch if you want.

300
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,810
All right.

301
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,430
<i>That's the seven.</i>

302
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,590
<i>Father has a pair of threes.</i>

303
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:17,440
<i>If they switch cards,
Baek Dae Gil will win.</i>

304
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,770
Actually, I don't think I should.

305
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:28,650
<i>Father has... won.</i>

306
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,240
What are you doing?

307
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,780
Don't regret it. Why not switch it?

308
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:40,510
This is a game of fate,
so let's just do it.

309
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,040
All right.

310
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,600
Show your cards.

311
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:59,970
A seven and two.

312
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,670
That totals nine.

313
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,040
Then, mine...

314
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,860
Wait.

315
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:10,250
I want to make sure that you're betting
this gambling room on this round.

316
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,850
If I lose...

317
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,170
I will give you this gambling room.

318
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,040
If you lose...

319
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:23,770
I will get all the gambling rooms
you've taken from Scholar Baek Myun.

320
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,760
What is it?

321
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,000
Are you relieved that
you didn't bet your life?

322
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:35,860
Not my life, but let's say the loser
grants the winner one wish.

323
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,970
How's that?

324
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:40,340
If it's a wish that can be granted.

325
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,430
Show your cards, then.

326
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,680
What... how?

327
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,770
There's no way.

328
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:10,980
Why not? The sound trick?

329
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:15,420
That's such a old trick
and you're still using it?

330
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:36,310
I put a scratch on the card
and changed the sound.

331
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,690
Even so...

332
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,830
How could you do that in
such a short amount of time?

333
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:46,570
You have to be at this level
to be called a card shark.

334
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:51,530
Gol Sa...

335
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,920
You will need to
take responsibility for this.

336
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,730
No, you can't!

337
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,260
You still have that bad habit
of backstabbing people.

338
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,710
Your sword has become very fierce.

339
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,750
Put away your swords.

340
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,680
It is not over yet.

341
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,520
This is a note for 1,000 nyang.

342
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,280
Baek Dae Gil.

343
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,200
I will offer 1,000 nyang for his life.

344
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,210
What are you doing, Yi In Jwa?

345
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,630
2,000 nyang!

346
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,270
2,000 nyang?

347
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:31,700
This is the kind of money
you will never touch in your lifetime.

348
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:49,000
This is still not enough for you?

349
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,400
Then...

350
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:55,290
I will add 3,000 nyang more.

351
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:58,150
That's 5,000 nyang!

352
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,690
- 5,000 nyang?
- 5,000...

353
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:03,960
That is enough money for three
generations to live off of.

354
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,050
Stop!

355
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,040
Who are you?

356
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,730
Move.

357
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,500
Listen up.

358
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,740
<i>[Baek Joong Ki (Union Member)]</i>

359
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,680
Baek Dae Gil saved us.

360
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,900
He's the one who saved us from Six Ghost.

361
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:34,440
What we need isn't this 5,000 nyang.

362
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,840
Don't you see it's people like this
who think of our lives?

363
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,060
That's enough!

364
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,980
Put away the weapons!

365
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,580
Do you think this is the street?

366
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,020
How dare you come to my game
and play around with money?

367
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,600
Then, are you saying you're going
to end the game like this?

368
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,650
A win is a win.

369
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:25,480
A man should accept his losses.

370
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:31,440
Do you dare to lecture me?

371
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,040
Go on and bring out the accounting book.

372
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,510
Father!

373
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:14,160
From the looks of things,
there's no place for you here.

374
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:18,750
I'm sure you didn't expect
that I could get Gol Sa.

375
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,190
I am surprised.

376
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,440
Honestly, I didn't come here
for your game with Gol Sa.

377
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,640
I came here for another reason.

378
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,440
It is exciting.

379
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,020
<i>That's right.</i>

380
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:48,190
<i>Whatever you see, hear, and experience,
make it entirely yours.</i>

381
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:54,480
Baek Dae Gil, you will come to
a fork in the road soon.

382
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,410
Just remember this.

383
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:01,820
There is no eternal enemy or ally
in this world.

384
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:06,880
If you have many allies,
you will have that many enemies, as well.

385
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,130
And you, Gol Sa...

386
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:18,120
For being unable to protect
your gambling room...

387
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,310
you will pay a severe price.

388
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,270
Let's go.

389
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,240
Is this it?

390
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,150
Your Highness.

391
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,610
If this accounting book is revealed

392
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:03,820
both the Soron and Noron factions
will be up in arms.

393
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:06,660
Can you handle that?

394
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:11,830
Do you think I am standing here now
without preparing for that?

395
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,390
Prepare everything.

396
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:23,120
All of the rights of commerce of Mapo
and the gambling room.

397
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,510
I will take over tomorrow morning.

398
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,490
All right.

399
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:32,870
Also... you said you'd grant a wish.

400
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,020
Grandpa!

401
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,350
Gol Sa!

402
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,670
Gol Sa.

403
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,350
South Goblin...

404
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,620
Old man...

405
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,790
You know what happens
if you play tricks, don't you?

406
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:57,830
I do like your eyeball.

407
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,340
Sir...

408
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:25,800
It was a mistake from younger,
immature days.

409
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,120
Forgive me.

410
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:36,110
They say if a body is worth 1,000 nyang,
the eyes alone are worth 900 nyang.

411
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,260
I've been living with one left eye
worth 450 nyang!

412
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,310
I just want to rip you apart!

413
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,220
But what can I do?

414
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,900
That's enough.

415
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:56,700
So, stand up.

416
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,400
I'm Baek Joong Ki of the
Hanyang small merchants.

417
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,550
I'm a merchant in Mapo,
Moon Young In.

418
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,850
I'm Yi Woon Chang from the Sanha markets.

419
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:38,890
Oh my.

420
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:41,650
I'm Shin Yong Gol,
head merchant from Anyang.

421
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,730
I'm Bong Ki Chil.

422
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:45,910
I'm Seo Yang Hoon from Busan.

423
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:49,860
I'm Yoon Kang from Gongju.

424
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:55,050
You've become a hero.

425
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,280
Don't you have to say thank you?

426
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:01,930
Thank you.

427
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:10,230
Then... let us part here.

428
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,490
Baek Dae Gil!

429
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:40,440
Cheers to Baek Dae Gil!

430
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:49,440
Father, I cannot allow this.

431
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,560
How can give your gambling room to him?

432
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,400
You worked so hard to build it.

433
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,840
It's not like you built it!

434
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,480
Don't get attached and have regrets.

435
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,150
You just need to get married.
Get married to a good man.

436
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:03,310
I'm not going to get married.

437
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,900
What do you think of him?

438
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,670
You know... Baek Dae Gil?

439
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:10,880
Father!

440
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,940
He did save your life.

441
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,690
By looking at your expression,
I can tell you don't hate the idea.

442
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:19,330
Father!

443
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,540
Baek Dae Gil took down Seosomun's
Six Ghost and now Mapo's Gol Sa too?

444
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:33,650
And now Yeoning has the
accounting books in his hands.

445
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:36,650
How did something like this happen?

446
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:39,160
Didn't you say we should wait and watch?

447
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,970
It is tomorrow.

448
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:47,650
What would happen
if that accounting book were to...

449
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:50,350
fall into the king's hands?

450
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,010
We need to come up with a plan now.

451
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:07,060
This one has records of those who
paid bribes as well as the amounts.

452
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:12,360
And this one...

453
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:17,190
has the names, times, and dates
of who received the bribes and when.

454
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:21,670
It has the name of witnesses, as well.

455
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:23,060
I was relieved.

456
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,650
Your name was not in there.

457
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:34,050
Then step away from this now
as you promised.

458
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,910
I will take care of the rest.

459
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:03,280
Wow, I feel so proud and satisfied.

460
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:06,340
It's because I raised him.

461
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:10,580
He was raised a boy of Joseon.

462
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,960
Now, he has made such a name for himself.

463
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,490
This is so satisfying.

464
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:21,860
Okay, I'm paying for all this so drink
and eat to your heart's content.

465
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:25,870
In the end, isn't your money my money?

466
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,730
When it comes to money,
the person holding it is the owner.

467
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,640
I'll bring out more alcohol.

468
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:42,800
You were so great, Dae Gil.

469
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,510
<i>Baek Dae Gil.</i>

470
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:00,930
By tomorrow morning,
the world will have turned upside down.

471
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:03,070
Because of your name.

472
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:22,490
Gosh, how come you
do not even get drunk?

473
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:25,270
Are you curious about that too?

474
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:26,840
Your Highness.

475
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,160
Your Highness?

476
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:37,920
The palace officials call me that
over and over and it gets so tiresome.

477
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,530
But why is it so nice to hear
"Your Highness" now?

478
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:43,790
Here, have a drink.

479
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:51,640
Your Highness.

480
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:02,070
About that Baek Dae Gil...

481
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:09,140
What is your reason for continuing to
remain close to him?

482
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,920
At your position and status,
are you trying to make a friend?

483
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:18,190
Is it something like that?

484
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:24,690
My position and status...

485
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:29,720
I threw those aside.

486
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,880
I threw aside power.

487
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:37,040
I threw aside my self-interest.

488
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:42,140
It was then that my eyes were opened.

489
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:50,110
It was then that I recognized friendship
in someone I could not before.

490
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:55,590
And that I had turned away from
the misery I knew the people suffered.

491
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:59,890
But I finally began to see.

492
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:07,690
You saw friendship and the people.

493
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:08,890
That's all good.

494
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,140
Can you...

495
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:21,720
give up your life for that friend?

496
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,490
For the people...

497
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:34,500
can you give up this throne?

498
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,970
Just know this.

499
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:51,010
If you cannot do that,
then he is not your friend.

500
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:54,690
He is not one of your people either.

501
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,320
Therefore...

502
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:03,400
behave in a manner that suits
your status and position in life.

503
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:20,010
Dae Gil, what's your dream?

504
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:24,900
Dream? I don't know.

505
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:28,320
I don't know what my dream is.

506
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,890
I do think that I'd like to
become someone's dream.

507
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:47,670
Well, then...

508
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,710
Can you become my dream too?

509
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,710
Seol Im, don't you have a dream?

510
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:08,570
I don't want a dream that's
not even within my reach.

511
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:14,500
I want it to become
a reality that's always here.

512
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:25,220
I'm going to go to sleep now.

513
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,430
Okay.

514
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,350
Thank you.

515
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:35,960
What for?

516
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:39,400
Just... everything.

517
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,480
Go to bed.

518
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:00,670
Who's there?

519
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,630
<i>You're stronger than I thought.</i>

520
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,000
Six Ghost... and Gol Sa, too.

521
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:16,780
Cutter.

522
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,080
Why don't you show me your skills?

523
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:42,560
You're not bad.

524
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:46,040
What is it?
Were you too scared to come alone?

525
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:02,630
Seol Im...

526
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:05,470
What are you going to do with her?

527
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:13,330
She says she's leaving
from under your control.

528
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:22,690
Leaving, you say?

529
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,720
I have a request.

530
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,800
Don't die in a harsh place.

531
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:14,470
That was embarrassing.

532
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,400
I'm sorry.

533
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,210
Be careful.

534
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,130
What are you doing?

535
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,220
If you've come, you should enter.

536
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:25,290
Dae Gil.

537
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,840
Take care of yourself.

538
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:31,780
Okay.

539
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:43,050
<i>You have only two choices.</i>

540
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:49,060
One is to leave here
and live your life out alone.

541
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:52,630
<i>I was told that I was
born with a bad omen.</i>

542
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:54,860
<i>I'm going to go far away.</i>

543
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:58,680
<i>Somewhere you won't be
and where I'll be alone.</i>

544
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,640
Where did he go off to?

545
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:08,020
Dae Gil!

546
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,250
Seol Im...

547
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,790
Seol Im!

548
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:37,770
These are Seol Im's shoes.

549
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:06,480
Even if you're the master here,
don't think you can replace my father.

550
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:10,280
I cannot accept you... ever.

551
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:12,640
I will not replace him.

552
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,870
I will make good on the favor
that he asked of me.

553
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:17,320
Favor?

554
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,350
Stop!

555
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,870
What do you think you're doing?
