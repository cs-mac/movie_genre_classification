00:00:08,663 --> 00:00:11,177
You mustn't talk like that,
Mr Goldstein.

Tourists or immigrants?
-Half and half

00:00:31,383 --> 00:00:32,896
This is going to be one
of those days...

8
00:00:37,383 --> 00:00:40,739
Haim? Where's the camera?

9
00:00:55,703 --> 00:01:00,015
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
Where's the rest?

10
00:01:00,223 --> 00:01:02,453
Look for it. - l' m looking, but l
can't find the 6th.

You all stay here.

00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:51,816
Hallo. -Go to the end of the
line. -That's a mistake Sir!

17
00:03:52,663 --> 00:03:56,019
Go to the end of the line.
-Alright, l' m going.

18
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:59,417
How long did you work?
-1 2 years.

19
00:03:59,943 --> 00:04:03,538
Are you the end of the line?
-Go to hell!

20
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:05,693
Move! -Alright, l' m moving.

21
00:04:07,423 --> 00:04:15,137
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1 0,
-l' m not giving.

22
00:04:15,503 --> 00:04:19,382
Damn you.
-Thank you.

23
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:27,575
Name? -Moshe Habusha?
Trade? -Shoemaker.

24
00:04:29,023 --> 00:04:34,302
How long? -About 20 years.
-That's good.

25
00:04:36,383 --> 00:04:38,977
They' ll take you to a
housing project. -Fine.

26
00:04:39,383 --> 00:04:42,455
Name? -Salleh Shabaty.
What's your trade?

27
00:04:43,663 --> 00:04:46,461
Mine? -Yes. -Shoemaker.

28
00:04:46,743 --> 00:04:51,863
How long? -I haven't worked
at it yet. -You haven't?

29
00:04:52,703 --> 00:04:56,901
Never! -So why did you
say shoemaker.

30
00:04:57,903 --> 00:05:03,216
It's a good job. -And that's
what you want to do here?

31
00:05:03,343 --> 00:05:05,811
No, I can't. Me,
I have a bad heart.

32
00:05:05,943 --> 00:05:09,333
I can only do light work.
-Shoemaking is light work.

33
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:12,774
Not for me. Me, I don't
have any experience at it.

34
00:05:19,503 --> 00:05:20,822
Housing project.

35
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:58,335
Are you Salleh Shabaty?
-Blessed be His name.

36
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:04,093
How many children
do you have? -A lot, 6.

37
00:06:06,303 --> 00:06:12,822
It's written here, 7.
See that, 7!

38
00:06:15,423 --> 00:06:18,540
Shall we get in? -Yes.
-Climb in!

39
00:06:47,103 --> 00:06:51,494
You need the whole road?
-Not me, the combine.

40
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,137
Pass. -Chichi.

41
00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:04,780
That's a kibbutznik.
-But he's got a bigger vehicle.

42
00:07:05,103 --> 00:07:08,857
It belongs to the kibbutz.
-Who does that belong to?

43
00:07:09,063 --> 00:07:12,135
To the kibbutzniks of course.
-So why isn't it his?

44
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:15,021
It's not his. It's his,
but it's not his.

45
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,259
Do you hear what you
are saying, Sir?

46
00:07:17,423 --> 00:07:22,019
Sure, just look at 'em, live,
eat and work, together.

47
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:27,777
The property belongs to them all.
-Really? All of them? -Yes.

48
00:07:29,103 --> 00:07:33,096
And is our house there too?
-No, a bit farther on.

49
00:07:33,463 --> 00:07:34,942
His name be blessed.

50
00:08:22,663 --> 00:08:24,096
This is it. We' re here.

51
00:08:27,503 --> 00:08:31,621
This is the house?
Why isn't it a nice house?

52
00:08:32,503 --> 00:08:39,454
That's not nice? -No. -It's
just for now. You' ll get soon.

53
00:08:40,943 --> 00:08:48,179
It's just for a few days. -Just
a few? -Yes. -I must think.

54
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:55,815
Alright, for a few days it's not
worth fighting. -Praise God.

55
00:08:59,343 --> 00:09:03,973
What's going on here?
Get out of here, go on.

56
00:09:05,983 --> 00:09:07,735
Everybody, get down.

57
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,251
Everybody take his own hand.

58
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,900
Take, take a hand.

59
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:21,936
Come, l' ll help you. -There's
no need. -No need to help?

60
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:25,015
No need. -A little bit of
courtesy man.

61
00:09:32,943 --> 00:09:35,980
How is he? -Alright
-Alright?

62
00:09:37,183 --> 00:09:40,141
It's a boy, you hear? A boy!

63
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:44,579
It doesn't matter.
Let it be a girl.

64
00:10:01,863 --> 00:10:03,854
This is rubbish, this is.

65
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:07,061
You forgot the old lady.

66
00:10:10,623 --> 00:10:16,380
Get her down! -Me? -Why
not? A little courtesy, no?

67
00:10:25,743 --> 00:10:30,294
Is she a relative? -I don't
know, maybe she is.

68
00:10:30,503 --> 00:10:34,212
If she wasn't, why would she
come all the way with us

69
00:10:34,303 --> 00:10:37,340
on the plane? Family, I think.

70
00:10:37,743 --> 00:10:42,055
Who can understand you?
Goodbye. -Goodbye Fatty.

71
00:10:45,823 --> 00:10:48,542
Goodbye sweetie. -Goodbye.

72
00:10:59,383 --> 00:11:02,056
What's the matter? What
happened? -Look!

73
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,698
What are you doing here?

74
00:11:04,783 --> 00:11:07,456
I' m not doing anything.
I was brought here.

75
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:11,418
It's just for a few days. We' re
getting a nice house.

76
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:15,738
What are you laughing at?

77
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:22,657
Hezky Goldstein. -lt doesn't
matter. Salleh Shabaty

78
00:11:23,103 --> 00:11:29,178
Please come in. -What, me?
Please, do come in.

79
00:11:29,343 --> 00:11:33,382
Put everything inside, so that
the sun doesn't ruin it.

80
00:11:38,143 --> 00:11:44,378
It's a nice place, lots of air.
When did you get here?

81
00:11:44,543 --> 00:11:47,853
Six years ago and you still
don't have a house?

82
00:11:48,143 --> 00:11:50,941
Not yet, what can you do?

83
00:11:51,023 --> 00:11:55,539
You mustn't speak like that,
Mr. Goldstein.

84
00:11:55,743 --> 00:12:01,056
You play backgammon? -Sure.
Six years in a transit camp.

85
00:12:01,423 --> 00:12:02,902
Mordechai!

86
00:12:11,743 --> 00:12:13,096
Dad, may I look?

87
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:17,893
What for, nothing is
in place yet

88
00:12:18,343 --> 00:12:21,938
and he wants to see how
we play backgammon.

89
00:12:22,103 --> 00:12:25,334
He wants to see. Go home.

90
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:30,417
Does Mr. Goldstein have
a cigarette perhaps?

91
00:12:34,343 --> 00:12:38,018
This is a good cigarette,
this is

92
00:12:39,863 --> 00:12:42,093
a good cigarette. Let's start.

93
00:12:46,663 --> 00:12:48,972
Please, put down half a lira.

94
00:12:52,823 --> 00:12:55,781
I already owe half a lira.
Start.

95
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:13,411
What' s he doing? -Nothing
It's just a clock.

96
00:13:14,063 --> 00:13:17,851
But he's disturbing my ears.

97
00:13:37,103 --> 00:13:39,856
Play. This is a good game.

98
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:11,781
Are they coming? -l' m
working, no? -And so am l.

99
00:14:12,103 --> 00:14:13,934
Get into the kitchen.
-Alright.

100
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,778
Please stop the singing
over there.

101
00:14:29,103 --> 00:14:32,061
Sing after the meeting.
I can't hear myself talking.

102
00:14:32,223 --> 00:14:33,576
That's your luck.

103
00:14:40,743 --> 00:14:42,062
Rita, please.

104
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:47,579
Comrades, this is a general
meeting and not a party.

105
00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:50,931
Silence!

106
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,652
And in the kitchen please.

107
00:15:01,983 --> 00:15:03,416
You may continue.

108
00:15:05,703 --> 00:15:09,821
Friends, you know that in
the hour of need

109
00:15:09,983 --> 00:15:12,178
our kibbutz is always to be
found forging ahead!

110
00:15:14,103 --> 00:15:16,219
Please, Bat-Sheva.
We have a lot of time.

111
00:15:16,903 --> 00:15:21,135
I' m sorry, but I've just
finished work with the cows.

112
00:15:24,703 --> 00:15:25,852
Comrades!

113
00:15:28,543 --> 00:15:32,775
The many immigrants arriving
in the country need us,

114
00:15:33,063 --> 00:15:37,102
and there is no doubt that we
will do our best for them.

115
00:15:38,543 --> 00:15:42,821
For this reason, I suggest
we adopt the transit camp.

116
00:15:49,743 --> 00:15:51,415
That means the transit camp.

117
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,056
Who opposes the motion?

118
00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:04,140
Nobody opposes?

119
00:16:04,303 --> 00:16:07,932
Those in favor,
raise your hands.

120
00:16:13,943 --> 00:16:15,934
Bat-Sheva, Zigi...

121
00:16:19,863 --> 00:16:21,854
Thank you friends.
The vote is unanimous.

122
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:26,420
Again the kibbutz has shown
its ideological maturity.

123
00:16:26,703 --> 00:16:29,171
Who is prepared to be
the counselor

124
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:31,534
for our adopted
transit camp?

125
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,934
There are two. -The general
meeting is over.

126
00:16:39,023 --> 00:16:43,380
No, it's not. -I disagree.
I didn't vote...

127
00:17:06,063 --> 00:17:09,100
Excuse me comrade. Do you
know where Shabaty lives?

128
00:17:09,503 --> 00:17:11,778
Over there. -Over there.
Thank you.

129
00:17:28,943 --> 00:17:30,934
Miss, Miss,

130
00:17:31,143 --> 00:17:35,534
What's it for. What is it
Miss? What do you want?

131
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,051
What are you doing here?

132
00:17:42,543 --> 00:17:45,182
Nothing happened Lady. I' ll
help you pick them up.

133
00:17:45,343 --> 00:17:48,733
That's nice of you.
-You' re really nice too.

134
00:17:49,023 --> 00:17:52,493
Excuse me, are you by
chance Mr. Shabaty?

135
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:56,292
No, l' m his son Shimon.
-Pleased to meet you.

136
00:17:58,823 --> 00:18:03,055
How do you do? This is my
mother. -Salah!

137
00:18:06,103 --> 00:18:07,855
The government
has arrived.

138
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:12,061
Go quickly Salah. Perhaps
she's a social worker.

139
00:18:12,463 --> 00:18:17,014
Sure. She' ll give you a note
to get a house.

140
00:18:17,503 --> 00:18:21,212
A note for a house.
That's good. I' m coming.

141
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:34,737
I' ll be back right away.

142
00:18:48,903 --> 00:18:52,213
Hallo. -Hallo. There's no
work, no food, no house,

143
00:18:52,383 --> 00:18:56,092
7 kids, one on the way.
His name is Ben-Gurion.

144
00:18:56,823 --> 00:18:58,939
We need a note to get
a house Lady.

145
00:18:59,143 --> 00:19:01,452
Mr. Shabaty, I don't
give out notes.

146
00:19:01,943 --> 00:19:05,299
It's my job to help you solve
your personal problems.

147
00:19:05,543 --> 00:19:08,182
That's it, and what's
your trade?

148
00:19:08,863 --> 00:19:14,096
Shoemaker. -A shoemaker?
-What's wrong with that?

149
00:19:14,183 --> 00:19:18,096
I can't talk like this. Come
please. -What? -Come.

150
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,214
One moment, Mr. Shabaty,
I have a few questions...

151
00:19:39,463 --> 00:19:43,854
Here. Please sit down.
-Here? - Yes, please.

152
00:19:45,623 --> 00:19:46,612
Thank you.

153
00:19:48,503 --> 00:19:50,733
That's it. Now...

154
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,895
Now the lady gives a note
for a house, and that's that.

155
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,019
Just a few more details,
Mr. Shabaty.

156
00:19:57,983 --> 00:20:01,896
Did you have brothers and
sisters? -Sure, lots.

157
00:20:02,183 --> 00:20:03,332
How many?

158
00:20:06,063 --> 00:20:10,056
You can't say exactly Miss.
some of them died...

159
00:20:10,223 --> 00:20:12,817
About how many?
-About a lot.

160
00:20:13,623 --> 00:20:18,174
When were you married?
-A long time ago.

161
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:21,934
How old were you?
-Small.

162
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,175
What's going on here?
Is it a cinema?

163
00:20:31,943 --> 00:20:35,822
Lady, enough with the
questions. We've finished.

164
00:20:37,823 --> 00:20:41,054
One moment, Mr. Shabaty,
let me help you.

165
00:20:41,263 --> 00:20:45,734
Your lack of confidence is due
to personal conflict, stemming

166
00:20:45,903 --> 00:20:49,339
from an
underprivileged childhood.

167
00:20:50,063 --> 00:20:52,531
Lady, I don't like that
sort of talk.

168
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:54,177
Then I shall explain
what I mean.

169
00:20:54,303 --> 00:21:00,492
Look, a snake bites you when
you' re small and you forget,

170
00:21:01,103 --> 00:21:06,416
but the trauma leaves a
scar on your soul.

171
00:21:07,743 --> 00:21:09,142
Who's small?

172
00:21:09,303 --> 00:21:11,737
You, Mr. Shabaty,
when you were a child.

173
00:21:11,823 --> 00:21:13,461
Me? -Yes.

174
00:21:14,463 --> 00:21:16,021
Maybe.

175
00:21:17,103 --> 00:21:24,657
What happens after, when you
see a snake near your house?

176
00:21:25,023 --> 00:21:29,574
Lady, there isn't a snake here
and I don't have a house.

177
00:21:30,223 --> 00:21:32,896
We don't need snakes here.

178
00:21:33,663 --> 00:21:36,416
We need a note for a house,
not snakes.

179
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,575
Mr. Shabaty, you don't
understand me.

180
00:21:40,143 --> 00:21:41,861
We must become friends,
musn't we?

181
00:21:42,223 --> 00:21:44,976
We should get to know
one another, no?

182
00:21:45,783 --> 00:21:50,334
That's true. What is the lady's
name? -l' m Bat-Sheva.

183
00:21:50,903 --> 00:21:56,773
Bat-Sheva, are you married?
-Single.

184
00:21:57,383 --> 00:22:01,456
Where do you work? -With
the cows. -Cows? -Yes.

185
00:22:02,503 --> 00:22:05,859
One moment Miss.
I' ll write it down.

186
00:22:08,503 --> 00:22:12,018
Cow-shed.

187
00:22:31,863 --> 00:22:34,661
Salleh, Salleh.

188
00:22:34,983 --> 00:22:36,701
Wait, I must think.

189
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:45,022
The lady works every day
and gets 60 lira a year.

190
00:22:45,183 --> 00:22:49,176
Yes, that's our budget.

191
00:22:52,543 --> 00:22:54,932
I can't even afford to buy
a nice dress in town.

192
00:22:57,783 --> 00:23:01,173
Never mind, never mind.
Where do you live?

193
00:23:01,383 --> 00:23:07,094
In a hut! -Like this one?
-More or less.

194
00:23:09,303 --> 00:23:11,658
Only the married couples
get a house.

195
00:23:11,943 --> 00:23:15,174
The single girls
sleep 3 in room -3?

196
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:17,254
Yes, 3 girls in one room.

197
00:23:17,423 --> 00:23:19,379
We don't have any money.
We never will.

198
00:23:19,463 --> 00:23:23,376
You shouldn't talk like that
Miss. -Yes. -You shouldn't.

199
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:26,017
So you are in a difficult
sociological situation?

200
00:23:26,183 --> 00:23:29,061
But, with the Lord's help
it will be better.

201
00:23:31,423 --> 00:23:35,416
When Bat-Sheva was small,
was she bitten by a snake?

202
00:23:35,863 --> 00:23:38,821
No, of course not.

203
00:23:42,183 --> 00:23:45,619
That's Neuman. I have to go.
Goodbye, Mr. Shabaty.

204
00:23:47,183 --> 00:23:51,301
Nothing bad happened. Don't
despair Miss Bat-Sheva.

205
00:23:51,503 --> 00:23:56,418
The government does what it
can, good people help.

206
00:23:57,423 --> 00:24:02,213
But Mr. Shabaty, I came to
help you. Neuman, Neuman.

207
00:24:05,263 --> 00:24:07,982
You should be well,
Miss Bat-Sheva.

208
00:24:08,543 --> 00:24:12,821
If you troubles in your heart,
l' m always here for you.

209
00:24:13,903 --> 00:24:16,542
You never disturb me.

210
00:24:23,983 --> 00:24:27,055
What a sociological girl that is.

211
00:24:30,743 --> 00:24:31,858
Forestry!

212
00:24:32,463 --> 00:24:36,012
Next! -Yes. -Name?
Miki Raveh.

213
00:24:36,463 --> 00:24:40,456
T rade? -Dental Technician.
-Forestry.

214
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:42,018
Is that why I studied
for six years?

215
00:24:42,183 --> 00:24:46,495
I don't care, I also studied
and worked on the roads.

216
00:24:47,183 --> 00:24:50,175
Forestry. Next.

217
00:24:52,103 --> 00:24:54,537
Name? -Kalman Binstock.

218
00:24:54,823 --> 00:24:59,214
Work? -Administration.
-Forestry. -Excuse me.

219
00:24:59,463 --> 00:25:04,093
Nothing. Your like all the other
new people here. Next!

220
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:08,612
It's your turn Dad. -I don't
want to. I' m scared of him.

221
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:13,212
Dad, it's for our new home.

222
00:25:13,423 --> 00:25:17,052
Alright, but stay with me,
I won't go alone.

223
00:25:17,263 --> 00:25:19,333
We' re here Dad. -Next!

224
00:25:19,703 --> 00:25:24,140
Salleh Shabaty. -Trade?
Shoemaker. -Forestry.

225
00:25:24,303 --> 00:25:26,612
Thank you very much.
That is excellent, forestry.

226
00:25:26,783 --> 00:25:30,378
No forestry. When I arrived,
I took any work I was given.

227
00:25:30,783 --> 00:25:34,901
I ate grass and slept in the
fields, my friend.

228
00:25:34,983 --> 00:25:39,454
But I want. -I don't care what
you want. Forestry. -Forestry.

229
00:25:41,023 --> 00:25:45,096
These new immigrants are
poor human material.

230
00:25:49,063 --> 00:25:50,212
Right, it's very simple.

231
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:53,295
As you saw, I dug a hole
about 30 cms deep.

232
00:25:53,983 --> 00:25:59,819
This is the plant, shake and
remove thus, you see?

233
00:26:00,463 --> 00:26:03,899
Put it in the hole, and cover.

234
00:26:05,743 --> 00:26:09,782
Now, press it down and
dig a saucer around it

235
00:26:12,063 --> 00:26:14,896
Smile a little, can't you!

236
00:26:23,263 --> 00:26:25,936
And with that, lets go to work.
Are there any questions?

237
00:26:26,103 --> 00:26:29,254
Yes, what's this for?

238
00:26:29,983 --> 00:26:33,578
We are turning this place
into a forest!

239
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:40,456
God makes forests.
-Yes, but we help him.

240
00:26:41,263 --> 00:26:46,576
He doesn't need help.
-Comrade, enough. To work.

241
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:21,340
Is that enough? -Comrade,
no time for frivolity now.

242
00:27:27,903 --> 00:27:31,418
Very nice. -So perhaps
you' ll do some now?

243
00:27:31,663 --> 00:27:35,702
Yes, please, this has
to be shaken.

244
00:27:38,863 --> 00:27:43,061
It's all wild. It doesn't want
to be a forest.

245
00:27:43,263 --> 00:27:48,735
Hold it please.
-What are you doing?

246
00:27:48,903 --> 00:27:54,057
You' re hitting it like a
shoemaker. -That's true.

247
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:10,212
The old man doesn't like
working, does he? -What?

248
00:28:10,943 --> 00:28:15,971
He'd run away if he could.
Do you know him?

249
00:28:17,103 --> 00:28:18,377
Yes. He's my father.

250
00:28:19,023 --> 00:28:24,222
Yes, my Dad also...

251
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:28,976
So, 30 cms as we said,
and cover the plant.

252
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:12,581
Please Sir, what is that for?

253
00:29:13,463 --> 00:29:15,818
I' m preparing a sign for the
man who gave the money

254
00:29:15,983 --> 00:29:17,416
for this forest, my friend.

255
00:29:19,183 --> 00:29:20,696
Here's the happy donor.

256
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:36,655
How do you do?
-How do you do?

257
00:29:37,223 --> 00:29:42,013
Mr. and Mrs. Birnbaum,
this is your forest.

258
00:29:43,183 --> 00:29:45,856
After me please. -Thank you.

259
00:29:58,903 --> 00:30:01,861
No, no...

260
00:30:02,103 --> 00:30:03,775
Go, go on.

261
00:30:04,143 --> 00:30:06,498
What's up?

262
00:30:06,663 --> 00:30:10,736
What do you with me, Sir?
What's going on?

263
00:30:10,983 --> 00:30:13,213
He won't let me go past him.

264
00:30:14,543 --> 00:30:16,932
Simon! -l' m coming.

265
00:30:20,703 --> 00:30:22,534
Where is that driver?

266
00:30:24,663 --> 00:30:26,699
I love working in the garden.

267
00:30:27,023 --> 00:30:29,742
You know, my dream is a
small house and garden.

268
00:30:30,423 --> 00:30:32,061
I' m also learning
to be a cantor.

269
00:30:32,863 --> 00:30:36,742
Comrade, they' re hooting at
you. -l' m not deaf. I know

270
00:30:37,863 --> 00:30:41,060
One day, l' ll show you how
I work in my garden.

271
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:46,656
Comrade, they' re hooting
again. -Be seeing you.

272
00:30:46,863 --> 00:30:48,774
See you. -Goodbye.

273
00:31:09,263 --> 00:31:15,213
" In Jumlat the
old Messiah lives

274
00:31:15,743 --> 00:31:20,180
" alone in a house, without..."

275
00:31:22,023 --> 00:31:26,301
What's going on over there?

276
00:31:27,703 --> 00:31:29,694
What's he doing there?

277
00:31:33,703 --> 00:31:35,933
What's that Sir? Another one?

278
00:31:36,343 --> 00:31:40,097
It's the tourist season.
Everyone wants a plaque.

279
00:31:40,463 --> 00:31:43,455
But that's not nice Sir.
It's like a lie.

280
00:31:58,503 --> 00:32:02,382
How do you do? -How do
you do? -Follow me, please.

281
00:32:04,383 --> 00:32:10,174
Mr. and Mrs. Zimmershein,
This is your forest.

282
00:32:11,183 --> 00:32:13,492
What the hell's going on here?

283
00:32:19,543 --> 00:32:24,094
Hey, stop that,
d'you hear me?

284
00:32:24,183 --> 00:32:26,902
Stop that! Stop that.
What are you doing here?

285
00:32:27,623 --> 00:32:30,581
It's Mr. Birnbaum's forest.

286
00:32:30,943 --> 00:32:33,537
For them, you have to plant
a new forest.

287
00:32:33,623 --> 00:32:37,218
You, you' re fired.

288
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:42,981
Me? -Yes you.
-Blessed be his name.

289
00:33:15,023 --> 00:33:20,222
Salleh, you' re the first guy to
be fired from relief work.

290
00:33:20,423 --> 00:33:24,496
There's a lot of people there.
I need some relief myself.

291
00:33:39,463 --> 00:33:44,173
You haven't learned the rules
of the game yet.

292
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,375
It's a new game.

293
00:33:50,823 --> 00:33:55,613
Goldstein, where did you get
so much money from?

294
00:33:55,823 --> 00:33:58,815
I've got a bit left from
the last elections.

295
00:33:58,983 --> 00:34:00,496
Elections? Is that hard work?

296
00:34:01,063 --> 00:34:05,261
No. You get paid
for voting political.

297
00:34:05,383 --> 00:34:10,457
You put a letter in an envelope
and you' re off free.

298
00:34:12,063 --> 00:34:15,419
Which letter?
-The one they tell you.

299
00:34:16,903 --> 00:34:20,452
Goldstein, looks like for once
there's some easy work

300
00:34:20,623 --> 00:34:23,615
though I can't work at it.
-Why?

301
00:34:24,303 --> 00:34:26,771
I don't recognize
the letters so well.

302
00:34:27,503 --> 00:34:31,576
It doesn't matter. It's
secret and no one sees.

303
00:34:32,143 --> 00:34:36,295
So how do they know what
you put in? -They don't.

304
00:34:36,943 --> 00:34:38,934
That's democracy.

305
00:35:03,463 --> 00:35:11,541
"The evening breeze,
Sings in the trees

306
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:16,858
"To whom does it sing?
To you and to me.

307
00:35:17,463 --> 00:35:18,418
'The two of us here...

308
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:22,496
Hush. It's late.
I must go home.

309
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:24,221
Can't we walk a little?

310
00:35:24,343 --> 00:35:27,938
That's how things are here,
not like in the kibbutz.

311
00:35:28,103 --> 00:35:32,062
Who says? Maybe I should
ask if I can date you?

312
00:35:33,103 --> 00:35:35,378
Is this a date? -Of course.

313
00:35:38,423 --> 00:35:39,651
In a minute.

314
00:35:58,103 --> 00:36:00,059
Habuba! Habuba!

315
00:36:04,183 --> 00:36:06,253
To hell with it.

316
00:36:51,263 --> 00:36:55,700
Habuba, Habuba,
Home.

317
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,700
What's the matter Salleh?

318
00:38:03,343 --> 00:38:05,811
I don't like that counselor
from the kibbutz.

319
00:38:06,063 --> 00:38:09,260
He's turning Habuba's head.
-Habuba's a good girl.

320
00:38:09,383 --> 00:38:11,135
Did I say she was bad?

321
00:38:11,503 --> 00:38:14,142
Only in the evening,
I want her in the house.

322
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:19,816
House? This is a house?
Can anyone see a house?

323
00:38:21,303 --> 00:38:24,932
Sits in his hotel all day long,
doing nothing, like a king,

324
00:38:25,263 --> 00:38:26,855
and says, house, he says.

325
00:38:27,383 --> 00:38:31,934
Don't start with me woman.
Give Paula some milk.

326
00:38:32,303 --> 00:38:35,978
Backgammon, backgammon all day
playing with that Goldstein.

327
00:38:36,223 --> 00:38:38,896
He's not ashamed. An
Ashkenazi playing backgammon.

328
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:40,701
We' re all Jews.
There's no difference.

329
00:38:40,783 --> 00:38:44,492
How long do we have to stay
here, with the little ones

330
00:38:44,863 --> 00:38:46,933
playing in the dirt and the big
ones running around like...

331
00:38:47,823 --> 00:38:51,782
Is it my fault? -Did Ben Gurion
make my children?

332
00:38:53,423 --> 00:38:59,214
Go to work so we can get
a house. -What can I do?

333
00:39:00,063 --> 00:39:02,213
They said they'd give us
a house and they don't.

334
00:39:02,623 --> 00:39:06,536
Everybody else gets,
except me. What can I do?

335
00:39:09,823 --> 00:39:11,097
Good evening.

336
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:15,296
Where's the money? -Money?
-From the work in the forest.

337
00:39:16,223 --> 00:39:18,532
He took all the money
Shimon earned as well.

338
00:39:19,183 --> 00:39:20,980
He went to drink in
the coffee shop.

339
00:39:23,063 --> 00:39:25,736
Drunkard! Drunkard!

340
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:27,742
Give me the money.

341
00:39:43,663 --> 00:39:51,343
Lord of the universe, this is
Salech Shabaty talking to you.

342
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:57,457
You, who brought us out
of Egypt, look at me,

343
00:39:57,543 --> 00:39:59,932
How do I look? How?

344
00:40:00,703 --> 00:40:07,575
The wife is right. There's no
work or house, nothing.

345
00:40:08,103 --> 00:40:14,053
All day long backgammon.
The house is not a house.

346
00:40:14,863 --> 00:40:16,899
It's a children's store,
that's all.

347
00:40:17,943 --> 00:40:22,334
Lord of the Universe,
help me.

348
00:40:23,223 --> 00:40:29,617
Everything is awful. Please
Lord, do something for me.

349
00:40:29,703 --> 00:40:37,212
Help me Lord! Help me!

350
00:40:38,743 --> 00:40:39,732
Help me!

351

" Announcement about the
elections" for the Knesset.

352
00:41:10,023 --> 00:41:12,662
Why have we been
sent to this hole?

353
00:41:12,743 --> 00:41:15,815
You should know that the
Party values every vote.

354
00:41:16,543 --> 00:41:18,773
Good. What do we do?
-l' ll tell you.

355
00:41:19,183 --> 00:41:21,743
From my experience in the
last three elections,

356
00:41:22,023 --> 00:41:24,253
the transit camp has a
very efficient system.

357
00:41:24,623 --> 00:41:27,615
They find the local " leader",
the " strong man",

358
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:31,652
the " king pin" of the place
and that' s it.

359
00:41:32,743 --> 00:41:37,134
Hallo, my friend, where is
everyone? -The coffee shop.

In short, Mr. Shabaty,
what are your conditions?

385
00:44:17,663 --> 00:44:24,739
For my vote, first of all,
I need a house.

386
00:44:26,823 --> 00:44:31,499
We' re already building. You' ll
be the first to get a house.

387
00:44:32,343 --> 00:44:35,733
We don't just make promises,
we always keep them.

388
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:39,700
It will be good.
Elections are good.

389
00:44:41,063 --> 00:44:45,932
Can I move on now?
-Only after the elections.

390
00:44:46,303 --> 00:44:49,022
What's the difference?
Before or after?

391
00:45:15,023 --> 00:45:16,900
Comrade Shabaty. -Comrade?

392
00:45:17,063 --> 00:45:18,701
Never mind. We've come
about the elections.

393
00:45:19,143 --> 00:45:21,941
Elections, that's good.
Please sit down.

394
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:27,857

395
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:55,417
" A gift to the transit camp,
donated by the Party."

396

Goldstein... -What's up?
-A miracle happened.

397
00:46:04,383 --> 00:46:07,898
They' re giving us a house and
everything we need.

398
00:46:08,263 --> 00:46:13,656
You made an agreement.
-Yes, with three parties.

399
00:46:13,743 --> 00:46:17,656
Each of them promised
me something.

400
00:46:18,183 --> 00:46:21,812
It was really hard to say no.

401
00:46:21,903 --> 00:46:26,772
I know, I have a deal with four
or five parties.

402
00:46:27,023 --> 00:46:32,177
So how do you vote?
-According to my conscience.

We hope that you will chose

forgotten, Madam.

406

-A small gift. -Thank you.

407

Take these home, we' ll bring
more. Come back quickly.

411
00:48:06,743 --> 00:48:11,294
I hereby declare the polling
booth station open.

412
00:48:12,783 --> 00:48:15,377
Mr. Shabaty, please.

413
00:48:36,103 --> 00:48:37,331
That's me.

414
00:49:35,343 --> 00:49:36,298
This,

415
00:49:39,863 --> 00:49:40,852
and this.

416
00:49:43,263 --> 00:49:44,252
And this.

417
00:49:46,143 --> 00:49:47,132
And this.

418
00:49:47,903 --> 00:49:48,938
And this.

419
00:49:50,223 --> 00:49:52,054
And this.

420
00:49:53,383 --> 00:49:54,611
And also this.

421
00:49:55,543 --> 00:49:58,296
And some of these.

422
00:49:59,743 --> 00:50:01,176
And some of these.

423
00:50:07,943 --> 00:50:11,458
Next please.
-Next.

424
00:50:13,223 --> 00:50:14,861
I haven't finished yet.

425
00:50:15,863 --> 00:50:17,740
And this.

426
00:50:18,143 --> 00:50:24,059
These are for the children,
and so are these.

427
00:50:26,143 --> 00:50:29,101
And this and that's enough.

428
00:50:38,743 --> 00:50:42,258
There's a lot. In here, yes?

429
00:50:47,583 --> 00:50:51,053
But the hole is too small.
It doesn't go in.

430
00:50:51,143 --> 00:50:53,532
It's no good. -Excuse me.

431
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:56,701
What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

432
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:58,616
It's alright.

433
00:50:59,103 --> 00:51:01,219
It's difficult to vote so much.

434
00:51:06,503 --> 00:51:08,221
That fell and that fell.
Wait a minute.

435
00:51:08,463 --> 00:51:11,694
Do you know what
you' re doing?

436
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:16,971
What do you want?
There's no room for all of it.

437
00:51:23,063 --> 00:51:24,735
It fell down.

438
00:51:27,823 --> 00:51:29,700
" Disqualified"

439
00:51:43,303 --> 00:51:48,980
They disqualified my vote
but l' ll get my house.

440
00:51:49,863 --> 00:51:52,696
They told me I'd be the
first on the list.

441
00:51:53,063 --> 00:51:55,782
The Lord should bless all
political parties. -Amen.

442
00:51:56,063 --> 00:52:00,454
Housing? -T ransit camp?
-Let's go.

443
00:52:16,743 --> 00:52:20,531
Nice. What's this for?
-It's for letters.

444
00:52:21,183 --> 00:52:24,778
Are we going to get letters?
That's good.

445
00:52:25,103 --> 00:52:28,459
This one will be for you,
and this is for you.

446
00:52:29,223 --> 00:52:32,260
There's enough for everyone.
This one is for me.

447
00:52:56,383 --> 00:52:59,102
It's all new. Your shoes.

448
00:53:23,823 --> 00:53:28,578
Look how nice. Like a
synagogue. -Nicer even.

449
00:53:31,183 --> 00:53:34,220
It's lovely. -lsn't it nice!

450
00:53:36,023 --> 00:53:37,456
It's new.

451
00:53:41,463 --> 00:53:42,498
Dad!

452
00:53:51,623 --> 00:53:55,411
That's for water.

453
00:53:59,863 --> 00:54:01,581
And this...

454
00:54:02,103 --> 00:54:05,618
And this one is also for water.

455
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:11,298
For water there's two taps.

456
00:54:37,143 --> 00:54:39,862
Rat a tat. Like a train.

457
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:50,132
There's two for the electricity
as well.

458
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:20,056
For every room a window.
for the air.

459
00:55:35,383 --> 00:55:38,580
This is my workshop.

460
00:55:42,383 --> 00:55:45,500
What the hell do you think
you' re doing?

461
00:55:47,903 --> 00:55:49,973
Who gave you permission
to come in here?

462
00:55:50,143 --> 00:55:54,295
It's our house. We got it for
the elections.

463
00:55:54,663 --> 00:55:57,575
Elections. Where is your
documentation?

464
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:02,978
Documents, there's a lot.
This, or this. All sorts.

465
00:56:03,183 --> 00:56:07,062
Idiot! Documents from the
Ministry to prove possession.

466
00:56:07,183 --> 00:56:10,698
Why, these are no good?
What minister?

467
00:56:11,903 --> 00:56:14,781
Sir, believe me, they told us.
"They said", doesn't work

468
00:56:14,863 --> 00:56:18,572
with me. Bring me the papers

469
00:56:18,823 --> 00:56:20,381
and l' ll let you into the house.

470
00:56:20,943 --> 00:56:24,777
Now get out, while l' m still
in a good mood.

471
00:56:28,263 --> 00:56:30,060
This is not good.

472
00:56:33,183 --> 00:56:36,095
The government doesn't
allow us in.

473
00:56:37,903 --> 00:56:39,131
Get on.

474
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:13,812
" Ministry of Housing"

475
00:57:22,783 --> 00:57:27,811
That man works well. I know
him. Stay here.

476
00:58:10,983 --> 00:58:13,417
Let's go. Back to the
transit camp.

477
00:58:15,543 --> 00:58:19,695
What did he want? -Money.
-They said it was for nothing.

478
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:22,980
The house is for nothing.
The papers cost money

479
00:58:23,183 --> 00:58:25,333
How much?
-A thousand lira.

480
00:58:25,943 --> 00:58:27,854
A thousand?

481
00:58:57,983 --> 00:59:03,819
Dad, are you asleep already?
-Yes, what do you want?

482
00:59:04,703 --> 00:59:11,142
The houses were so nice
and new. -And white.

483
00:59:12,703 --> 00:59:17,015
Why do they trick us all the
time? -Because we' re new.

484
00:59:17,423 --> 00:59:22,053
You trick greenhorns.
-It's mean. -Why not?

485
00:59:22,623 --> 00:59:26,536
One day when we've been
here a long time

486
00:59:26,983 --> 00:59:33,058
we' ll also trick the newcomers.
I' ll fix 'em.

487
00:59:34,063 --> 00:59:40,457
If, let's say, a new immigrant
comes to my shoe shop.

488
00:59:41,303 --> 00:59:46,935
What do you mean, your
shoe shop? -Never mind that.

489
00:59:48,463 --> 00:59:54,777
He asks for new shoes, I say,
" l' m sorry Sir,

490
00:59:55,423 --> 01:00:00,497
You have to wear old shoes,
why, because you are new.

491
01:00:02,183 --> 01:00:06,620
" I was also new once." I say.
That's the way it goes.

492
01:00:06,983 --> 01:00:09,736
That's what you' ll say to
the poor guy?

493
01:00:11,183 --> 01:00:18,134
"You won't believe me Sir,
once " I lived in a dirty, old hut,

494
01:00:18,863 --> 01:00:21,423
" but I never said a word.

495
01:00:22,063 --> 01:00:24,941
" I didn't wait to be given
a kiosk, my friend.

496
01:00:25,383 --> 01:00:29,342
" I went to work in the road
gangs and in the forests.

497
01:00:29,703 --> 01:00:34,094
" I sweated my guts out,
the way I worked"

498
01:00:42,783 --> 01:00:46,935
Now it's late. You've got to go
to sleep Mordecai.

499
01:00:48,463 --> 01:00:54,413
Perhaps l' ll look for a job.
No, you' re too young.

500
01:00:54,903 --> 01:00:57,178
You still have to learn.

501
01:00:58,663 --> 01:01:00,654
Someone has to work, no?

502
01:01:31,943 --> 01:01:35,856
Neuman, l' m obliged to point
out that hired labor opposes

503
01:01:35,943 --> 01:01:38,741
the basic principles of the
movement. -4 men Chichi.

504
01:01:38,823 --> 01:01:40,415
Even half. We' re talking about
quantity here.

505
01:01:40,583 --> 01:01:42,778
Did we adopt the transit camp
or not? -We did.

506
01:01:42,903 --> 01:01:44,416
So these are like
our own sons.

507
01:01:44,583 --> 01:01:46,574
But ideologically
that is absurd.

508
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:50,937
Who knows? Maybe you' re
right. I thought that.

509
01:01:51,543 --> 01:01:52,578
OK, send 'em back.

510
01:01:52,703 --> 01:01:55,501
It's not that. I need someone
in any event. Even half a man.

511
01:01:55,663 --> 01:01:58,018
Neuman, you should live so
long, you wouldn't do that.

512
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:00,618
Let me have him.

513
01:02:00,743 --> 01:02:04,053
I' m sorry, I've already
promised him to the kitchen.

514
01:02:06,023 --> 01:02:10,062
One, just one I want.
-Neuman, l' m getting mad.

515
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:13,101
You, you go to the fields.
-Neuman, Neuman.

516
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:18,981
Neuman, I want him.
-Excuse me?

517
01:02:19,303 --> 01:02:22,932
What? We've known each
other for a long time

518
01:02:23,183 --> 01:02:26,698
I helped the lady picking fruit.
-You picked fruit? -Yes.

519
01:02:27,623 --> 01:02:31,662
Can you work with the cows?
-Who, him? -I can learn.

520
01:02:32,343 --> 01:02:35,016
He's cut out for the job
-l' m mad about cows.

521
01:02:35,383 --> 01:02:38,455
A real case of mad cows
disease. -OK. T ake him.

522
01:02:38,543 --> 01:02:42,502
But he's mine. -Neman gives,
Neuman takes away. -Simon.

523
01:02:43,703 --> 01:02:47,696
Hallo Mr. Shabaty. -Hallo Miss
Sociology. -He's a good boy.

524
01:02:47,863 --> 01:02:50,900
Pretty as a picture. -Dad,
stop it. -What's wrong?

525
01:02:51,743 --> 01:02:58,216
Are you still three in a room?
-We' re four now.

526
01:02:58,583 --> 01:03:03,611
If Miss Batsheva wants to live
with us, she's welcome.

527
01:03:03,783 --> 01:03:07,696
That's kind of you Mr. Shabaty.
-lf you have any problems,

528
01:03:07,903 --> 01:03:10,861
I can always help you.
-Thank you, but it's OK.

529
01:03:11,903 --> 01:03:15,213
What's going on, a party?
-Goodbye, Mr. Shabaty.

530
01:03:15,383 --> 01:03:17,817
Come my friend. You can
help me move my office.

531
01:03:33,503 --> 01:03:36,381
What's up with you?
-What's this? -It's nothing.

532
01:03:36,543 --> 01:03:40,775
It's a very big nothing. -Don't
worry, he's our guard dog.

533
01:03:40,943 --> 01:03:43,059
Come with me.
-He should go first.

534
01:03:44,143 --> 01:03:45,496
Jeremiah, sit.

535
01:03:47,783 --> 01:03:50,695
Are you afraid of dogs?
-l' m not afraid of anyone.

536
01:03:50,903 --> 01:03:52,894
It's just, I don't like the way
he looks at me.

537
01:03:56,263 --> 01:03:59,335
Freda, I've found some one.
We' re moving the cupboard.

538
01:03:59,623 --> 01:04:01,375
At last, thank goodness
for that.

539
01:04:07,623 --> 01:04:11,616
Move, my friend, move.

540
01:04:12,983 --> 01:04:15,497
Is this the cupboard?
-No, this is the cupboard.

541
01:04:16,583 --> 01:04:18,494
You take it. One, two,
my friend. One, two.

542
01:04:18,663 --> 01:04:22,941
I must think. How much?
-How much what? -Money.

543
01:04:23,103 --> 01:04:25,537
How much? The same
that we give everyone.

544
01:04:25,703 --> 01:04:27,978
Six lira a day. -I don't
talk to women.

545
01:04:28,663 --> 01:04:33,214
*?Sir, it's not like for everyone.
-Friend, we say here. Not Sir.

546
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:37,657
I don't know the lady.
Why should I say friend?

547
01:04:37,983 --> 01:04:42,613
Sir, a porter gets per unit.
-my budget is just six lira.

548
01:04:42,823 --> 01:04:47,578
No, this cupboard to that
house, seven.

549
01:04:47,903 --> 01:04:50,861
Finish it already. -You tell me
where l' ll get another lira.

550
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:53,173
I don't care, as long as you
take that monstrosity away.

551
01:04:53,303 --> 01:04:57,854
Take a lira from the animal
budget. -Thank you, Lady.

552
01:04:57,983 --> 01:04:59,701
It's nothing friend.

553
01:05:13,343 --> 01:05:15,095
Sign here please.

554
01:05:17,943 --> 01:05:19,342
And here.

555
01:05:22,463 --> 01:05:23,816
And also here, please.

556
01:05:26,943 --> 01:05:28,012
And here.

557
01:05:32,903 --> 01:05:35,053
I hope the committee will
authorize this.

558
01:05:36,503 --> 01:05:37,936
Now get out of here,
both of you.

559
01:05:39,823 --> 01:05:44,897
A bit right, and left. Be careful.
What are you doing?

560
01:06:23,183 --> 01:06:25,413
Move, my friend, move. Lift it,
one, two, and we' re done.

561
01:06:25,743 --> 01:06:30,021
I' m not doing that. -What do
you mean? -No!

562
01:06:30,663 --> 01:06:33,302
Excuse me, we agreed that
you'd bring it to this house.

563
01:06:33,623 --> 01:06:37,172
As far as the house, I said.
This is the house. This far.

564
01:06:37,383 --> 01:06:38,816
And who will take it upstairs?

565
01:06:38,983 --> 01:06:42,453
Don't know. This is the house.
Upstairs is something else.

566
01:06:44,783 --> 01:06:48,981
Oh yeah? Nobody makes fun
of me, my friend.

567
01:06:49,143 --> 01:06:53,898
If need be, l' ll even do it
by myself, even today.

568
01:06:55,503 --> 01:07:01,612
Guys! Come and give a hand.
Yoske, just for a minute...

569
01:07:01,783 --> 01:07:03,455
You' re insane.

570
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:18,979
60 grush? -3 lira!
Where do I get 3 lira?

571
01:07:19,543 --> 01:07:23,172
I don't know. You own the
kibbutz. Sell it. -Sell it?

572
01:07:24,743 --> 01:07:27,621
That's wonderful, sell it!
Look, the time is going.

573
01:07:27,783 --> 01:07:30,377
See here, friend Shabaty, you
want 3 and l' ll give 60 grush.

574
01:07:30,583 --> 01:07:34,132
Let's reach a compromise.

575
01:07:35,743 --> 01:07:38,382
For you Sir, I do compromise.

576
01:07:38,543 --> 01:07:42,172
But cut out all the talk. -Alright,
how much will you take?

577
01:07:43,023 --> 01:07:46,493
3.60. -What?

578
01:07:57,943 --> 01:08:00,093
Well, what's going on?

579
01:08:01,383 --> 01:08:03,772
I' m doing just what you told
me and nothing's happening.

580
01:08:03,863 --> 01:08:07,333
That's because you' re not
concentrating. Sit closer.

581
01:08:09,903 --> 01:08:13,691
Put the bucket between your
knees. Close your fingers.

582
01:08:15,703 --> 01:08:20,697
Don't bend over. -I won't tell
my father how girls boss me.

583
01:08:21,143 --> 01:08:24,818
Your father is sweet.
-Yes, he likes you too.

584
01:08:25,103 --> 01:08:26,377
Really?

585
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,253
He says you' re a sweet,
sociological case.

586
01:08:29,543 --> 01:08:32,376
Usually he won't talk to women.
-You don't say.

587
01:08:32,823 --> 01:08:36,896
That's how it is with us. We
take no notice of women.

588
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:41,253
When my mother is about to
give birth, we' re all scared.

589
01:08:41,663 --> 01:08:43,938
So, has Ben-Gurion
been born yet?

590
01:08:44,943 --> 01:08:48,538
Paula was born and Mother
shut herself away 2 weeks.

591
01:08:49,183 --> 01:08:54,780
I don't believe a man of
Mr Shabaty's caliber

592
01:08:55,583 --> 01:08:59,622
who shows such concern
for other people,

593
01:09:00,423 --> 01:09:05,622
a man who is so sensitive,

594
01:09:07,063 --> 01:09:08,815
would ignore his wife,
in so boorish a way.

595
01:09:08,983 --> 01:09:11,622
Forgive me, if you want
to know, l' ll tell you,

596
01:09:11,823 --> 01:09:14,462
I have never met a nicer man.

597
01:09:14,983 --> 01:09:20,137
When he looks at me with...
those flashing eyes of his,

598
01:09:20,783 --> 01:09:22,853
and when he smiles at me
with that smile...

599
01:09:24,943 --> 01:09:27,980
I would, do you hear me,
if he was 20 years younger

600
01:09:28,343 --> 01:09:30,379
I could fall in love with him.

601
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:41,696
I swear...

602
01:09:44,623 --> 01:09:48,172
Why aren't you milking? Have
you got two left hands?

603
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:58,052
Like this, like this.

604
01:09:59,303 --> 01:10:01,612
Isn't it boring with four hands?

605
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:05,339
Boring? I could do this
from morning till evening.

606
01:10:10,223 --> 01:10:14,501
Alright Comrade Shabaty,
I won't go on vacation.

607
01:10:14,663 --> 01:10:18,736
From me you' ll get 4 lira and

608
01:10:22,903 --> 01:10:25,497
want Mr. Comrade not to have
a vacation because of me.

609
01:10:25,583 --> 01:10:29,735
I' ll go, l' ll go. Just take the
cupboard upstairs. -Alright.

610
01:10:30,703 --> 01:10:32,580
Mr. Comrade, you
have a cigarette?

611
01:10:32,823 --> 01:10:36,020
Anything, as long as you take
the cupboard up.

612
01:10:36,343 --> 01:10:40,495
This is a good cigarette.
You have a good job?

613
01:10:40,823 --> 01:10:46,022
Yes, l' m an accountant. -And
my brother can count sheep.

614
01:10:46,103 --> 01:10:49,095
I' m the kibbutz secretary.
I' m an official.

615
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:53,302
Then it's another 50 grush.
-Why? -For being an official.

616
01:10:53,623 --> 01:10:56,183
Now it's 5 lira and 1 0 grush.

617
01:10:56,343 --> 01:11:00,052
No, my friend you won't get
rich at the kibbutz expense.

618
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:04,894
I' m not getting rich. I just need

619
01:11:08,943 --> 01:11:12,731
How many cupboards a year
do I have? -I don't know.

620
01:11:12,903 --> 01:11:16,612
Just one. -How many children
do I have? -I don't know.

621
01:11:16,703 --> 01:11:22,494
5, 5 boys 2 girls and a girl.
-Very nice. -What's so nice?

622
01:11:22,703 --> 01:11:26,696
Not nice. -lf you had problems
Sir, like my problems

623
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:28,899
you wouldn't talk like that.
Don't you think

624
01:11:29,063 --> 01:11:33,853
we need to eat? We need
electricity, glasses for Mazal.

625
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:37,613
the sick fund for Juli's asthma
we need. -You need, you do.

626
01:11:37,743 --> 01:11:42,578
Who needs? -No need, l
don't need. I just need to rest

627
01:11:42,983 --> 01:11:48,615
The cupboard can sit here
forever. -But the rain will come.

628
01:11:48,823 --> 01:11:50,495
The flood can come.

629
01:12:14,143 --> 01:12:16,213
Hallo Joseph, the wise one.

630
01:12:23,063 --> 01:12:26,533
The Lord bless you and keep
you, Goldstein.

631
01:12:26,983 --> 01:12:30,339
If you stop playing backgammon
with me, I don't know

632
01:12:30,503 --> 01:12:32,141
how l' m going to make
a living.

633
01:12:32,703 --> 01:12:37,538
But it will take a year till I can
win a1 0000 lira from you.

634
01:12:38,183 --> 01:12:41,459
6 months. -That's also
a long time.

635
01:12:44,503 --> 01:12:49,577
Goldstein, 1 000 lira and I get
a house. A lovely house.

636
01:12:49,903 --> 01:12:55,136
Haven't you got anything to
sell? -No, l' m a shoemaker.

637
01:12:56,223 --> 01:12:59,454
Mr. Goldstein, perhaps you
have something I can sell.

638
01:12:59,623 --> 01:13:05,380
I could sell the clock with the
bird in the flea-market.

639
01:13:09,423 --> 01:13:13,780
It doesn't matter. I don't need
it Goldstein.

640
01:13:15,743 --> 01:13:18,496
How can I earn some money?

641
01:13:19,023 --> 01:13:22,095
There's notices. -For work?

642
01:13:25,303 --> 01:13:32,095
" Lost, a white Poodle.
Answers to the name of Puzzi,

643
01:13:33,223 --> 01:13:38,741

644

6, Benjamin Street,

645
01:13:45,823 --> 01:13:47,142
Puzzi...

646
01:13:51,223 --> 01:13:52,258
Yes...

647
01:14:22,263 --> 01:14:25,539
What are you doing here?
This is no place for a woman.

648
01:14:25,623 --> 01:14:29,138
Get out of here. Go on home.

649
01:14:43,063 --> 01:14:49,980
That's Jeremiah, that one.
Nissim, Rahamim, wait.

650
01:14:50,783 --> 01:14:52,102
Now me.

651
01:14:54,183 --> 01:14:58,540
Nissim, Rahamim,

652
01:14:59,463 --> 01:15:00,862
Nissim, stay here,

653
01:15:03,183 --> 01:15:05,219
That's enough Nissim.

654
01:15:09,383 --> 01:15:12,659
That's enough Rahamim.

655
01:15:14,863 --> 01:15:19,937
Quiet Nissim, enough.

656
01:15:22,943 --> 01:15:24,092
Rahamim...

657
01:15:31,343 --> 01:15:38,499
Come my friend, come,
that's good, come, come.

658
01:15:41,303 --> 01:15:45,057
That's good, nice sausage.

659
01:15:45,423 --> 01:15:49,735
Come on, taste it.

660
01:15:51,023 --> 01:15:53,617
Come, come.

661
01:15:56,583 --> 01:15:58,972
Come with that,

662
01:16:01,183 --> 01:16:06,211
Come, come...

663
01:16:06,863 --> 01:16:08,933
It's very good sausage,

664
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:15,417
Come my friend, come on...

665
01:16:20,143 --> 01:16:22,737
That was very good sausage.

666
01:16:39,703 --> 01:16:46,541
What does he want, that one?
He's a dangerous dog.

667
01:16:47,623 --> 01:16:52,139
We' ll have to get Shimon to
bring some really strong rope.

668
01:16:52,303 --> 01:16:55,340
What's all this?

669
01:17:27,463 --> 01:17:28,862
Now we don't need anything.

670
01:17:32,983 --> 01:17:34,211
I told you,
we don't need anything.

671
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:37,261
Hush woman. What's wrong?
Is Mr. Dr. Kurz at home?

672
01:17:37,423 --> 01:17:40,142
What is your business?
-Puzzi. -A moment please.

673
01:17:44,263 --> 01:17:49,291
Please come in. Do enter
please. Thank you very much.

674
01:17:50,743 --> 01:17:52,415
Thank you, please.

675
01:17:52,903 --> 01:17:55,417
Do forgive the reception,
l' m afraid we didn't know.

676
01:17:55,503 --> 01:17:57,016
Puzzi? Where is she?

677
01:17:59,263 --> 01:18:02,539
Won't you sit down Sir?
-Where? -Over here.

678
01:18:04,183 --> 01:18:10,338
Here? -Yes. -No, Mrs. I' m not...
-Where is Puzzi, where is she?

679
01:18:10,463 --> 01:18:13,933
It's alright, he's nearby.
-Here? -Yes.

680
01:18:15,863 --> 01:18:22,541
Will you have a drink? -Arak?
-No, we have fruit juice. -No.

681
01:18:22,983 --> 01:18:24,655
I' m sorry. -It's not important.

682
01:18:29,503 --> 01:18:31,778
Puzzi, Puzzi,

683
01:18:37,743 --> 01:18:40,337
Now that's good. -Now,
please, will you bring her?

684
01:18:41,863 --> 01:18:45,458
70 lira reward. -70 lira? -Yes.

685
01:18:46,143 --> 01:18:50,694
That's a lot of money, my dear
Sir. -it's a lot for a cat.

686
01:18:50,863 --> 01:18:56,017
A dog costs a lot. If the lady
loses a cat, l' ll find him

687
01:18:56,143 --> 01:19:00,898
for 30 lira. If it's little and
skinny, for 20 lira.

688
01:19:01,343 --> 01:19:03,732
Never mind, take the money.

689
01:19:07,663 --> 01:19:10,735
Take the glass. You stay here
and l' ll go and get him.

690
01:19:11,703 --> 01:19:13,580
Puzzi, Puzzi.

691
01:19:15,543 --> 01:19:20,776
Theodore, I want to cry.
-Calm yourself my dear, soon

692
01:19:20,943 --> 01:19:25,141
she' ll be here with us.
-My darling little dog.

693
01:19:28,823 --> 01:19:36,377
Come on, come here Puzzi.
Here's your Puzzi

694
01:19:37,823 --> 01:19:41,736
Excuse me. What is that?
-That's Puzzi, that is.

695
01:19:44,663 --> 01:19:47,939
That's not Puzzi.
-It's a dog, isn't it?

696
01:19:48,343 --> 01:19:52,052
The man is mad. Get him out
of here. That's not my Puzzi.

697
01:19:52,303 --> 01:19:57,377
How do you know? -It's 3
times the size, not a bitch,

698
01:19:58,863 --> 01:20:03,175
and it's almost black. -So it's
black. -Can't you see?

699
01:20:05,463 --> 01:20:09,820
Always the same. Black's no
good. If it's white it's good.

700
01:20:10,023 --> 01:20:11,741
No, it's really not
because of that.

701
01:20:12,663 --> 01:20:16,622
I know, it's not the dog,
it's the color that counts.

702
01:20:16,783 --> 01:20:21,254
Is that why I brought it all the
way from the kibbutz?

703
01:20:22,663 --> 01:20:27,020
I don't have any luck.
I never have any luck.

704
01:20:27,183 --> 01:20:32,257
Theodore tell him to go.
-Get out of here. Go on.

705
01:20:50,863 --> 01:20:55,698
That Jeremiah is a dangerous
dog. You have to be careful.

706
01:20:59,983 --> 01:21:06,502
Sir, please take me, take me.
Please take me. Why not?

707
01:21:08,383 --> 01:21:13,582
Please take me. Please take me.

708
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:18,013
No one wants to give me a lift.
Why aren' t I a young girl?

709
01:21:25,103 --> 01:21:28,732
Good evening, Mr. Shabaty.
Good evening fat driver.

710
01:21:28,903 --> 01:21:33,533
Get in. -T o the transit camp.

711
01:21:38,903 --> 01:21:41,178
Hallo. -Yes

712
01:21:42,863 --> 01:21:45,058
I see you' re always together.

713
01:21:45,223 --> 01:21:49,739
The silly bitch is in love with
me. She's got a lot of money.

714
01:21:50,143 --> 01:21:53,215
She can't understand
what we' re saying?

715
01:21:53,383 --> 01:21:54,418
Course not!

716
01:21:54,543 --> 01:21:57,933
What did you say, Honey?
-We say you very pretty, sugar

717
01:21:58,103 --> 01:22:00,094
You silly man.

718
01:22:02,663 --> 01:22:05,939
She's nothing to me. You
know who I really like.

719
01:22:06,023 --> 01:22:09,060
My daughter, Habuba!
-How did you know?

720
01:22:09,583 --> 01:22:11,858
If it wasn't true, you wouldn't
have stopped for me.

721
01:22:12,863 --> 01:22:16,902
I think about her a lot. I'd even
be prepared to marry her.

722
01:22:17,943 --> 01:22:20,741
I know that you have different
customs, I know,

723
01:22:21,063 --> 01:22:23,338
but l' m even prepared to pay
or her dowry.

724
01:22:24,023 --> 01:22:27,459
How much? -How much do
you want? -1 000 lira.

725
01:22:28,503 --> 01:22:29,652
I've got 600.

726
01:22:29,823 --> 01:22:32,257
600. Would you marry her?

727
01:22:33,423 --> 01:22:36,017
That's it. You always get what
you don't want.

728
01:22:36,223 --> 01:22:39,693
Always what you don't want.
-Ain't that the truth?

729
01:22:40,863 --> 01:22:43,218
So what about Habuba?

730
01:22:44,903 --> 01:22:47,292
We' ll see. I' m thinking.

731
01:22:55,023 --> 01:22:58,538
You say the dog stayed there?

732
01:22:59,103 --> 01:23:02,937
And Mr. Kurtz and his wife,
they were scared,

733
01:23:03,623 --> 01:23:05,215
and the maid.

734
01:23:11,143 --> 01:23:13,452
Come, let's have a drink.
-What?

735
01:23:25,103 --> 01:23:29,255
It's very funny, Goldstein, but
I didn't make any money.

736
01:23:29,423 --> 01:23:32,460
No, not the clock.

737
01:23:32,543 --> 01:23:34,499
Who needs it? -No
-Who needs it?

738
01:23:35,863 --> 01:23:38,616
You know Goldstein,
that fat driver wants

739
01:23:39,023 --> 01:23:46,532
to give me 800 lira to marry
Habuba. -Shall I take it?

740
01:23:47,663 --> 01:23:52,942
Does Habuba love him? -l
don't know, but she' ll learn.

741
01:23:53,103 --> 01:23:55,742
If not, l' ll kill her.
-That's not nice.

742
01:23:55,943 --> 01:23:59,219
Not nice to sell your daughter.
-Those are our customs.

743
01:23:59,423 --> 01:24:01,778
I need the money for a house,
Goldstein.

744
01:24:01,983 --> 01:24:05,578
I can't go on living there.
It's driving me crazy.

745
01:24:07,223 --> 01:24:10,340
You know, that fat driver's
right when he says that

746
01:24:11,063 --> 01:24:14,135
you always get what you
don't want, he says.

747
01:24:15,143 --> 01:24:18,055
If I wanted to stay in
the transit camp to live,

748
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:21,215
then they'd probably want me
to go and live

749
01:24:24,703 --> 01:24:26,898
in the housing project,
Mr. Goldstein.

750
01:24:28,583 --> 01:24:34,897
In a house? Do you hear? You
get what you don't want.

751
01:24:37,383 --> 01:24:41,342
No Housing Project.
We want the T ransit Camp.

752
01:24:41,663 --> 01:24:45,258
No Housing Project.
We want the T ransit Camp.

753
01:24:45,743 --> 01:24:49,452
No Housing Project.
We want the T ransit Camp

754
01:25:08,423 --> 01:25:12,894
The housing project is
garbage. -Houses garbage.

755
01:25:14,383 --> 01:25:17,455
T ransit camp! -T ransit camp!

756
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:21,814
None of this makes an
impression on me.

757
01:25:24,983 --> 01:25:28,293
It's not for you to decide
on absorption policy,

758
01:25:31,143 --> 01:25:32,622
but for the government.

759
01:25:32,783 --> 01:25:36,219
This is anarchy. Disperse at
once, or l' ll call the police.

760
01:25:40,463 --> 01:25:41,942
Rabble!

761
01:25:44,383 --> 01:25:48,137
That was a success.
Go home everyone.

762
01:25:53,583 --> 01:25:55,221
Go home, that was good.

763
01:25:55,703 --> 01:25:57,659
Juli, come over here.

764
01:26:01,463 --> 01:26:04,500
You' re staying here on strike.
Sit down.

765
01:26:31,103 --> 01:26:32,331
Zigi.

766
01:26:33,503 --> 01:26:35,175
Zigi. -Yes

767
01:26:36,063 --> 01:26:39,260
There's a cab driver,
you know him. He's tall.

768
01:26:40,183 --> 01:26:43,220
So what?
-He wants to get married.

769
01:26:43,823 --> 01:26:47,782
Congratulations. -To me.
He wants to marry me.

770
01:26:51,823 --> 01:26:55,941
You? Why? Do you like him?

771
01:26:57,423 --> 01:27:00,540
Dad likes him. -Then he can
marry your father.

772
01:27:01,543 --> 01:27:02,976
You can marry me.

773
01:27:05,943 --> 01:27:09,015
Zigi, that driver offered
dad 800 lira.

774
01:27:10,063 --> 01:27:11,542
For what? -For me.

775
01:27:13,863 --> 01:27:18,300
Well, you've got a good price,
Habuba.

776
01:27:18,583 --> 01:27:20,494
Zigi, those are our customs.

777
01:27:22,623 --> 01:27:25,262
Aren't I worth 800 lira?
-You' re worth a million.

778
01:27:25,423 --> 01:27:26,776
You' re worth a million.

779
01:27:26,943 --> 01:27:29,503
But we live in the State of
lsrael not the desert.

780
01:27:30,543 --> 01:27:33,376
It's not nice to talk like that.
-l' m sorry.

781
01:27:36,303 --> 01:27:37,782
Have you got 800 lira?

782
01:27:37,983 --> 01:27:41,896
It's not the money that is
important, no, I don't have it.

783
01:27:42,623 --> 01:27:45,217
You don't love me.
-I love you madly, Habuba,

784
01:27:45,303 --> 01:27:48,101
but I don't have 800 lira
or even 8 lira.

785
01:27:48,463 --> 01:27:52,581
That's not true, you work in
our place and earn a wage.

786
01:27:52,743 --> 01:27:55,940
But that all goes straight to
the treasurer. -Wonderful.

787
01:27:56,063 --> 01:27:57,291
Those are our customs.

788
01:27:58,903 --> 01:27:59,938
Sorry.

789
01:28:01,423 --> 01:28:04,574
Zigi? -Yes. -Will you buy me
from my father? -Yes, sure.

790
01:28:04,663 --> 01:28:07,735
I' ll talk to the secretariat.
Perhaps they can help me.

791
01:28:09,223 --> 01:28:12,420
I shall fight them
till the last bullet.

792
01:28:12,623 --> 01:28:17,139
Silence, I request silence
comrades.

793
01:28:20,943 --> 01:28:22,217
Silence!

794
01:28:40,943 --> 01:28:45,937
Members, Zigi's problem is
an individual problem.

795
01:28:46,863 --> 01:28:49,696
But it is also a matter
of principle.

796
01:28:50,103 --> 01:28:52,219
No, Neuman, it's a matter
of 800 lira.

797
01:28:52,783 --> 01:28:56,298
Fellow members, I am
basically opposed

798
01:28:56,463 --> 01:28:58,533
to any form of buying women
from outside the kibbutz.

799
01:28:59,223 --> 01:29:00,861
How's it possible from inside?

800
01:29:03,343 --> 01:29:05,777
Just a minute Zigi. Why spend
money on a product

801
01:29:05,943 --> 01:29:07,899
that you can find inside
the kibbutz.

802
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:09,696
That's true.

803
01:29:10,303 --> 01:29:14,455
Maybe Bat-Sheva doesn't
have two eyes or long hair.

804
01:29:14,943 --> 01:29:18,572
Ask her new helper with
the cows. -Simon...

805
01:29:21,103 --> 01:29:24,140
That's enough,
we' re really just friends.

806
01:29:25,023 --> 01:29:27,093
Simon...

807
01:29:29,663 --> 01:29:32,860
Just a minute, is it possible
for a simple person

808
01:29:33,023 --> 01:29:34,092
to say something?

809
01:29:34,423 --> 01:29:38,098
My dear Zigi, there are some
basic principles that even

810
01:29:38,343 --> 01:29:40,982
you cannot ignore.
-For example?

811
01:29:41,703 --> 01:29:45,412
For example, that everything
bought with kibbutz money

812
01:29:45,823 --> 01:29:47,939
belongs to the kibbutz,
for example.

813
01:29:50,703 --> 01:29:53,058
No, no, it doesn't.

814
01:29:53,543 --> 01:29:58,094
A member of a collective
can not keep a live inventory.

815
01:29:58,943 --> 01:30:00,899
But Habuba is not an
inventory. -That's true.

816
01:30:01,583 --> 01:30:03,733
Shall I write this expense
in sub-section 54?

817
01:30:03,903 --> 01:30:05,621
We don't have a budget
for buying wives!

818
01:30:05,783 --> 01:30:08,013
Come on Neuman, it's still
a basic necessity.

819
01:30:08,503 --> 01:30:12,291
When Saruki got lumbago,
we bought him a mattress.

820
01:30:12,423 --> 01:30:14,653
We did, but the mattress
belongs to the kibbutz.

821
01:30:15,183 --> 01:30:18,539
It belongs to the kibbutz,
but only he sleeps on it.

822
01:30:34,023 --> 01:30:36,218
Fellow members,
l' m leaving the kibbutz.

823
01:30:56,703 --> 01:31:00,742
Dad, can I talk to you
for a minute? -Not now.

824
01:31:05,183 --> 01:31:06,377
Perhaps we' ll stop now?

825
01:31:06,503 --> 01:31:07,856
No, Goldstein.
You' re staying here.

826
01:31:07,983 --> 01:31:10,895
You don't leave a game at
a bad time. What's up?

827
01:31:11,983 --> 01:31:15,134
Someone wants to marry me.
-Really?

828
01:31:16,343 --> 01:31:20,575
At last she's got some sense.
She's a good girl, that one.

829
01:31:21,023 --> 01:31:25,972
When did you talk to the fat
cab driver? -Dad, it's not him.

830
01:31:27,783 --> 01:31:30,502
It's Zigi. -Zigi? That's an
Ashkenazi name isn't it?

831
01:31:30,743 --> 01:31:32,096
Mr. Goldstein is also
an Ashkenazi.

832
01:31:32,183 --> 01:31:34,492
For losing a game,
not for marrying.

833
01:31:35,103 --> 01:31:37,776
I love him Dad. -Never mind
that. Does he have money?

834
01:31:38,143 --> 01:31:42,375
He's so nice. -Does he have
money? -You' ll like him, Dad.

835
01:31:42,743 --> 01:31:45,894
Does he have money? -The
kibbutz won't give him any.

836
01:31:46,183 --> 01:31:48,743
You' re never going
to see him again, in your life.

837
01:31:49,583 --> 01:31:51,096
I can't do that Dad.

838
01:31:51,743 --> 01:31:55,577
Your good father tells you to
do something and you can't?

839
01:31:56,223 --> 01:31:58,612
I' m sorry Father, l' m going
to marry Zigi.

840
01:31:59,463 --> 01:32:02,216
Without my permission?
-Yes.

841
01:32:03,463 --> 01:32:05,897
Without money?
-Yes.

842
01:32:07,103 --> 01:32:08,092
Alright...

843
01:32:11,303 --> 01:32:12,258
Alright...

844
01:32:13,063 --> 01:32:16,533
I' ll kill you. I' m going
to kill everyone.

845
01:32:17,783 --> 01:32:21,776
They want to steal my child
and without paying for her.

846
01:32:22,103 --> 01:32:28,372
I' ll kill 'em all, the thieves.
Thieves, thieves.

847
01:33:44,663 --> 01:33:49,179
Hallo Freda. -Hallo Zigi.

848
01:33:51,903 --> 01:33:54,258
Hallo Zigi. -Hallo Neuman,
How are you?

849
01:33:58,343 --> 01:34:00,982
Maybe for all that Zizi?
-For all what Neuman?

850
01:34:01,383 --> 01:34:03,578
Why have you come here?
-It's like this Zigi, we came

851
01:34:03,703 --> 01:34:05,978
to prevent you from doing
something irresponsible.

852
01:34:06,143 --> 01:34:08,703
Are you really stupid or
are you just putting it on?

853
01:34:08,943 --> 01:34:11,741
There's nothing more to say.
I can't live without Habuba.

854
01:34:12,383 --> 01:34:16,262
Habuba costs 800 lira.
I don't get the 800 lira.

855
01:34:16,343 --> 01:34:18,903
I' m leaving to find work and
that's that. -That's that?

856
01:34:19,103 --> 01:34:22,061
Very nice, l' m sure. -Leave it
Neuman. Leave him alone.

857
01:34:22,223 --> 01:34:26,262
Zigi doesn't care about the
moral harm he causes. The

858
01:34:26,463 --> 01:34:29,261
people in the camp will think
they can grow daughters and

859
01:34:29,823 --> 01:34:32,417
sell them to the agricultural
sector at exaggerated prices.

860
01:34:32,623 --> 01:34:34,261
But 800 lira is not an
exaggerated price!

861
01:34:34,343 --> 01:34:36,299
Do you know how much
aluminum piping you can get

862
01:34:36,463 --> 01:34:38,977
for that price. And 1 0
kerosene stoves.

863
01:34:39,143 --> 01:34:40,895
But who wants to cuddle up
to a kerosene stove?

864
01:34:41,783 --> 01:34:44,775
Calm down Zigi...

865
01:34:46,103 --> 01:34:48,173
Fellow members, there is...

866
01:35:01,103 --> 01:35:02,582
Dear Lord...

867
01:35:06,303 --> 01:35:08,419
Hallo Mr. Zigi, l' m here.

868
01:35:10,783 --> 01:35:17,939
Hallo Mr. Shabaty. Please
meet Habuba's father.

869
01:35:20,103 --> 01:35:21,616
We have already met.

870
01:35:24,583 --> 01:35:26,460
Hallo. -hallo Sir.

871
01:35:27,143 --> 01:35:29,816
You' re not going to give
money for Mr. Zigi?

872
01:35:30,703 --> 01:35:33,854
Comrade Shabaty, let's have
a talk, like old friends.

873
01:35:34,583 --> 01:35:35,698
Why?

874
01:35:36,783 --> 01:35:39,934
Comrade Zigi tells me
that you' re demanding

875
01:35:40,103 --> 01:35:44,016
700 lira for your daughter.
It's 800, Sir. -800.

876
01:35:44,103 --> 01:35:47,812
Habuba is young and strong
and can work like crazy.

877
01:35:48,583 --> 01:35:50,778
That's no way to...
-I don't talk to women.

878
01:35:50,943 --> 01:35:51,819
It's difficult to accept that.

879
01:35:51,903 --> 01:35:55,179
You don't have to,Lady.
A woman doesn't sit and

880
01:35:55,423 --> 01:35:58,301
Iisten to men talk. She does
washing and cooking. See?

881
01:35:58,463 --> 01:36:01,216
My dear Sir. We are living
in the 20th century.

882
01:36:01,503 --> 01:36:03,175
I live in a transit camp, Lady.

883
01:36:03,863 --> 01:36:07,492
The 20th century's not a place
to live. -Nor is the camp.

884
01:36:08,303 --> 01:36:11,898
We' re not talking about living
standards, but emotions.

885
01:36:12,543 --> 01:36:15,501
This is about a father selling
his daughter, like a horse.

886
01:36:18,503 --> 01:36:23,258
A horse? I' m selling Habuba
like a horse am l?

887
01:36:26,263 --> 01:36:29,335
Can you get a horse for 800
lira, can you?

888
01:36:29,423 --> 01:36:33,860
The lady knows how much
is a horse? -1 200 or 1 500 lira.

889
01:36:34,023 --> 01:36:36,537
An old horse. A new
one costs 2000.

890
01:36:37,503 --> 01:36:41,496
For sure Lady. You can
get a woman for 50 lira.

891
01:36:41,823 --> 01:36:44,098
The sort of woman who's like
Miss Comrade.

892
01:36:44,823 --> 01:36:48,816
Not young, not pretty, not
work. Just talk all day.

893
01:36:48,943 --> 01:36:50,456
Certainly it's possible.
-My dear Sir...

894
01:36:50,543 --> 01:36:52,693
No friend.
-Dear Sir...

895
01:36:52,863 --> 01:36:54,615
Freda, leave him alone.
-Zigi, leave me alone.

896
01:36:54,743 --> 01:36:57,940
This has gone too far.
My dear Mr. Shabaty,

897
01:36:58,423 --> 01:37:02,780
You oriental communities,
with all due respect,

898
01:37:03,423 --> 01:37:07,974
must try and adapt to our
country's new, modern reality,

899
01:37:08,383 --> 01:37:12,058
and forget your own barbarian
customs which

900
01:37:12,183 --> 01:37:14,094
you brought with you.

901
01:37:16,143 --> 01:37:22,742
Forget? Why should I forget?
You always want us forgetting

902
01:37:23,023 --> 01:37:25,139
what's not good for you.

903
01:37:27,303 --> 01:37:33,412
Tell me Sir, if our customs are
' barb', whatever that word is

904
01:37:33,783 --> 01:37:39,062
we have a custom where the father
gives 1 000 lira for his

905
01:37:39,383 --> 01:37:41,738
daughter to marry in kibbutz?
This also we should forget?

906
01:37:42,183 --> 01:37:46,574
Not this. You say only to
forget if not good for you.

907
01:37:48,183 --> 01:37:51,573
You say it's not good. Why?

908
01:37:52,063 --> 01:37:55,419
Why do Sir and Lady eat
shnitzel all day?

909
01:37:55,903 --> 01:37:59,816
Pretty songs, pretty songs,
like cotton wool.

910
01:38:02,983 --> 01:38:04,098
That's no good.

911
01:38:04,263 --> 01:38:06,936
Symphony in minor all day on
radio to drive you mad.

912
01:38:07,143 --> 01:38:08,417
And that's good?

913
01:38:08,583 --> 01:38:12,053
Why Sir and lady hear this
only this all the years?

914
01:38:12,143 --> 01:38:14,782
When they were little they
heard just this, just this?

915
01:38:14,943 --> 01:38:16,899
Now already, they don't know
what's good.

916
01:38:17,263 --> 01:38:19,652
Barbara or no, our custom is
to pay father

917
01:38:19,743 --> 01:38:23,133
for bringing up daughter all
the years for Mr. Zigi.

918
01:38:23,383 --> 01:38:26,341
Here in kibbutz, you sow and
you don't want harvest?

919
01:38:36,063 --> 01:38:39,021
Enough. We don't
need anything.

920
01:38:41,303 --> 01:38:44,454
Mr. Zigi, I wanted money for
housing project,

921
01:38:46,303 --> 01:38:51,821
but now I don't need. I see
you talk and talk

922
01:38:51,943 --> 01:38:55,652
but truth is, you' re poorer
than social welfare.

923
01:38:56,623 --> 01:38:58,853
Finished. We don't
need anything.

924
01:38:59,543 --> 01:39:01,932
To tell the truth, Mr. Zigi,

925
01:39:02,143 --> 01:39:07,581
I can get 800 lira for Habuba.
What do you think of that?

926
01:39:08,023 --> 01:39:10,935
From a bus driver who is very
inter-urban.

927
01:39:12,263 --> 01:39:16,336
But Habuba doesn't love him
because of he's fat.

928
01:39:18,103 --> 01:39:19,821
We don't need.

929
01:39:21,343 --> 01:39:25,131
Salah Shabaty gives his
Habuba for Mr. Zigi.

930
01:39:25,423 --> 01:39:27,220
For no money.
How's that?

931
01:39:27,583 --> 01:39:29,574
Mr. Shabaty. -Thank you.

932
01:39:29,983 --> 01:39:32,736
Salleh Shabaty doesn't take
money from poor people.

933
01:39:34,023 --> 01:39:39,620
Just a moment, poor?
What's this, Neuman, we' re poor?

934
01:39:40,223 --> 01:39:44,136
Wait a minute. No fat driver is
going to out-do our kibbutz.

935
01:39:44,623 --> 01:39:48,093
There's no difference.
No money is no money

936
01:39:48,583 --> 01:39:51,222
Don't you do us any favors.
You' ll get your money.

937
01:39:51,383 --> 01:39:54,341
Down to the last penny.
-Freda, my dear.

938
01:39:55,103 --> 01:39:57,981
Zigi, what are you doing?
Stop that, really.

939
01:40:00,223 --> 01:40:03,772
So you mean, you do
want to pay me?

940
01:40:05,743 --> 01:40:07,938
Yes! Yes!

941
01:40:09,103 --> 01:40:12,493
Well, if you all want,
l' ll take.

942
01:40:15,823 --> 01:40:18,735
Everybody here.

943
01:40:23,823 --> 01:40:26,542
Yes, the Sir is giving money
for Habuba.

944
01:40:28,103 --> 01:40:31,459
Not yet, not yet. Sir.

945
01:40:32,623 --> 01:40:36,980
Neuman, Is it final? Where will
we get the money from?

946
01:40:37,263 --> 01:40:39,572
I know.
We can steal chickens.

947
01:40:39,983 --> 01:40:41,177
Sir...

948
01:40:49,223 --> 01:40:50,736
Not here, come with me.

949
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:27,139
Mr. Shabaty, I congratulate
you. -Thank you very much.

950
01:41:29,543 --> 01:41:32,341
I' ll never ever forget this.
-Leave me alone already.

951
01:41:32,503 --> 01:41:33,856
I' m resigning anyway.

952
01:41:36,663 --> 01:41:40,736
Excuse me, Comrade Shabaty,
how do you want the money?

953
01:41:40,823 --> 01:41:46,932
Like money. -I understand,
but how many payments?

954
01:41:48,183 --> 01:41:51,937
It doesn't matter, as long
as I get all of it now.

955
01:42:01,343 --> 01:42:04,494
No, not here. Come inside.

956
01:42:18,983 --> 01:42:20,735
750!

957
01:42:23,263 --> 01:42:27,575
49.50.
More small change.

958
01:42:29,903 --> 01:42:31,177
50...

959
01:42:40,223 --> 01:42:43,295
That's alright l' ll live.
-From your lips....

960
01:42:44,263 --> 01:42:45,332
Thank you.

961
01:42:46,743 --> 01:42:49,655
Got it. Now for the
housing project.

962
01:42:50,663 --> 01:42:53,097
Here's our sociological.

963
01:42:56,343 --> 01:42:59,972
Hallo, Simon. -Hi Dad.
-Hallo, Mr Shabaty.-Hallo.

964
01:43:00,143 --> 01:43:05,012
I've got news. I' m getting a
new room. A family room.

965
01:43:07,183 --> 01:43:11,779
For how many girls? -Two of
us. Simon and me.

966
01:43:14,583 --> 01:43:18,337
We' re getting married first, of
course. What did you think?

967
01:43:18,543 --> 01:43:23,663
What, you and...
get married.

968
01:43:24,983 --> 01:43:28,771
That's a good thing, my son.
She's a very good girl.

969
01:43:28,983 --> 01:43:31,622
In spite of the snake bite.

970
01:43:33,943 --> 01:43:37,902
Come on woman, don't cry.
This is a great day.

971
01:43:38,103 --> 01:43:42,654
Not only will we get a house,
but also grandchildren...

972
01:43:56,143 --> 01:44:00,534
Bat-Sheva is a good girl,
healthy, strong, works well.

973
01:44:05,343 --> 01:44:06,492
No!

974
01:44:09,583 --> 01:44:10,538
Yes.

975
01:44:28,223 --> 01:44:29,975
Enough, back to the camp.

976
01:44:34,823 --> 01:44:39,738
Salleh Shabaty, he' ll never
have a house, never ever,

977
01:44:40,743 --> 01:44:43,462
Never, Salleh Shabaty,

978
01:44:44,863 --> 01:44:45,932
Never.

979
01:45:17,543 --> 01:45:21,172
What's going on. What are
you all doing here?

980
01:45:21,463 --> 01:45:23,101
What are you doing?

981
01:45:23,743 --> 01:45:28,976
What did I do?
You think l' m a thief?

982
01:45:31,983 --> 01:45:36,773
Leave my children alone.
Leave my children.

983
01:45:43,223 --> 01:45:47,296
What do you want of
my children?

984
01:45:47,583 --> 01:45:49,539
What have we done?

985
01:45:49,623 --> 01:45:53,935
I said you won't decide where
you live. The housing project!

986
01:45:54,783 --> 01:45:58,742
What's wrong? -Go to the
houses! -To the houses...

987
01:46:16,823 --> 01:46:19,815
That was successful, that was.
-Congratulations Salleh.

988
01:46:19,983 --> 01:46:23,658
Congratulations. Backgammon?
Off to work.

989
01:46:27,343 --> 01:46:28,856
Fix this.

990
01:46:35,823 --> 01:46:42,217
" In Jumlan lives an old
Messiah, in Jumlan...

991
01:46:48,463 --> 01:46:52,502
" And he was lucky seven-fold

992
01:46:52,583 --> 01:46:55,495
" And who was born first?
-Jamila, his daughter...

993
01:46:55,743 --> 01:46:58,940
" And who was born next?
-Jamila, his daughter.

994
01:46:59,183 --> 01:47:02,175
" And who was after that?
-Jamila his daughter,

995
01:47:02,463 --> 01:47:05,535
" And who was born last?
-Zillah and Gilah

996
01:47:05,783 --> 01:47:12,177
" No son to bear his name.
-Till the Messiah comes again.
