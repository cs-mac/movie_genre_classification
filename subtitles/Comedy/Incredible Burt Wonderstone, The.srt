1
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,879
Is it ready?

2
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,239
Hey! That's a great punch.

3
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,559
Fear no good.
So emotion and control.

4
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,272
Breathe. Breathe.

5
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,315
Wait.

6
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,269
Okay.

7
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,072
I can make it work for a while,
but you need...

8
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,950
Okay. Okay.

9
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,990
Shut that off! Turn it off!

10
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,794
Watch out!

11
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,709
Okay!

12
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,552
That's not right.

13
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,594
Oh, you.

14
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,395
You see that? See that?
My ticket out of here.

15
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,634
Damn it!

16
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,672
Here's something
a bit more interesting.

17
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,914
It's a possible gamma sickness. Milwaukee.

18
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,799
A man drank one of those guarana sodas.

19
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,150
Guess it had a little more kick
than he was looking for.

20
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,389
Wow.

21
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,478
- Where was it bottled?
- Porto Verde, Brazil.

22
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,230
Have our people look for a white man
at the bottling plant.

23
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,551
Tell them no contact!
If he even sees them, he's gone!

24
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,753
I got you who I could.
Short notice, but they're all quality.

25
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,799
And I pulled you one ace.

26
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,838
Emil Blonsky.
Born in Russia, raised in England.

27
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,595
And on loan to SOCOM
from the Royal Marines.

28
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,549
I know you
cashed in some chips for this, Joe.

29
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,473
Glad I could help. Just make it good.

30
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,155
This is the target and the location.
Snatch and grab, live capture.

31
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,071
You'll have your dart clips
and suppression ordnance,

32
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,390
but live fire is for backup only.

33
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,994
We got local out there,
but we want it tight and quiet.

34
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,638
Is he a fighter?

35
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,790
Your target is a fugitive
from the US government

36
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,030
who stole military secrets.

37
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,511
He is also implicated
in the deaths of two scientists,

38
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,275
a military officer, an Idaho state trooper
and possibly two Canadian hunters.

39
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,318
So don't wait to see if he's a fighter!

40
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,119
Tranq him and bring him back.

41
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,433
Oh, come on.

42
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,069
Camera.

43
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,675
Here we go.

44
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,279
Get rid of the damn dog.

45
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,635
Take him!

46
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,712
Target's on the move.

47
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,069
Where is he?

48
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,354
He's on the ground.

49
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,112
- Let's go!
Go!

50
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,909
Move, move!

51
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,158
Go, go, go!

52
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,953
Go! Go!

53
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,438
Clear everyone out!

54
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,755
Do not lose him!

55
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,912
Oh! No!

56
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,835
Get around behind him!

57
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,834
Target moving past mobile unit 0-9-0.

58
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,074
Oh, no.

59
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,151
You got to be kidding me.

60
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,670
Where is he?
- Target acquired.

61
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,115
Gringo!

62
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,909
Let's go.

63
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,109
No!

64
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,359
Please! No!

65
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,033
Not the computer!

66
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,599
Gimme that! No!

67
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,433
You bad angry, G?
I very bad angry.

68
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,109
Oh, no.

69
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,874
You don't understand! Something really bad
is about to happen here!

70
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,071
Anybody else seeing this?

71
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,671
We've got a bogey
of some kind. Please advice.

72
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,593
That is the target!
Use every tranq you've got!

73
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,159
Do it now!

74
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,869
Go live! Go live! Go live!

75
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,678
Move!
Get out of the way!

76
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,269
No!

77
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,955
It's behind us! Move! Move!

78
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,428
Get him!

79
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,149
Shoot!

80
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,430
Leave me alone.

81
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,949
No! No!

82
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,308
I knew something was different
before I got the shot off.

83
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,630
He had it on him when he bolted.

84
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,711
Is that a girlfriend? She helps him, maybe?

85
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,353
She is no longer a factor.

86
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,750
We closed that door to him a long time ago.
He's alone.

87
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,719
He wants to be alone.
But see if he's been talking to anybody.

88
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,758
Forgive me, sir?

89
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,077
Doesn't anybody want to talk
about what went down in there? 'Cause...

90
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,799
He didn't lose us.

91
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,509
And he was not alone, sir. We had him.

92
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,830
And then something hit us, something...

93
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,639
Something big hit us!

94
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,711
It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball!

95
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,150
It was the most powerful thing
I've ever seen.

96
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,558
Well, it's gone.

97
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,398
Well, if Banner knows what it is,

98
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,472
I'm gonna track him down,
I'm gonna put my foot on his throat

99
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,312
- and I'm gonna...
- That was Banner.

100
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,029
It

101
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,959
was Banner.

102
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,074
- You have to explain that statement, sir.
- No, I don't.

103
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,152
You've done a good job.

104
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,599
Pack up and get our men on a plane.
We're going home.

105
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,475
Wait.

106
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,234
Please.

107
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,519
Where am I?

108
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,558
I've run into bad situations
on crap missions before.

109
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,709
I've seen good men go down

110
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,917
purely because someone didn't let us know
what we were walking into.

111
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,270
I've moved on to the next one,
because that's what we do, right?

112
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,679
I mean, that's the job.

113
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,909
But this?

114
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,399
This is a whole new level of weird.

115
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,233
And I don't feel inclined
to step away from it.

116
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,232
So if you're taking another crack at him,
I want in.

117
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,995
And, with respect, you should be looking
for a team that's prepped and ready to fight,

118
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,071
because if that thing shows up again,

119
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,675
you're gonna have a lot of professional
tough guys pissing in their pants.

120
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,350
Sir.

121
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,552
Tienes más stretchy?

122
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,430
Yeah. Perfecto.

123
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,555
Let me emphasise
that what I'm about to share with you

124
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,837
is tremendously sensitive,
both to me personally and the Army.

125
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,632
You're aware that we've got an
Infantry Weapons Development programme.

126
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,157
Well, in WWII, they initiated a subprogram

127
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,708
for Bio-Tech Force Enhancement.

128
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,518
Yeah, Super Soldier.

129
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,915
Yes.

130
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,876
An oversimplification, but yes.

131
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,434
And I dusted it off, got 'em doing
serious work again, bold work.

132
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,114
Across the hall,
they were trying to arm you better.

133
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,316
We were tryin' to make you better.

134
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,714
Banner's work was very early phase.
It wasn't even weapons application.

135
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,268
He thought he was working
on radiation resistance.

136
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,432
I would never have told him
what the project really was.

137
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,957
But he was so sure of what he was onto,
that he tested it on himself.

138
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,713
And something went very wrong.

139
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,877
Or it went very right.

140
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,593
As far as I'm concerned, that man's
whole body is the property of the US Army.

141
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,513
You said he wasn't working
on weapons, right?

142
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,636
- No.
- But you were. You were, weren't you?

143
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,631
You were trying other things.

144
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,473
One serum we developed

145
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,954
was very promising.

146
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,554
- So why did he run?
- He's a scientist.

147
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,638
He is not one of us.

148
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,759
- Blonsky, how old are you? 45?
- 39.

149
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,950
- It takes a toll, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

150
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,234
So get out of the trenches.

151
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,675
You should be a Colonel by now,
with your record.

152
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,833
No, I'm a fighter.
L'll be one for as long as I can.

153
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,992
You know, if I could take what I know now,
put it in the body I had ten years ago,

154
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,719
that would be someone
I wouldn't want to fight.

155
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,393
I could probably arrange
something like that.

156
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,432
Take care, kids.

157
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,679
Stan, I give you my word,

158
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,398
whatever you've heard about me,
it's not true.

159
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,517
Oh, I know it. I always knew it.

160
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,239
I mean, you know how I felt about you two.

161
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,833
- Have you talked to her?
- No.

162
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,070
She doesn't know that I'm here.

163
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,998
- She's with somebody?
- Yeah, he's a head shrink.

164
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,356
They say he's one of the best.
But a really nice guy.

165
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,078
Good. That's good.

166
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:47,790
- Bruce, what can I do to help you?
- I could use a bed for a few nights.

167
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,589
- You can have the spare room upstairs.
- That'd be so great.

168
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,475
There is one other thing.

169
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,072
Excuse me. Pardon me.

170
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,033
Coming through.

171
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,311
Hey, pal. I got a delivery on five.

172
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,633
I don't think there's anybody up there.

173
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,998
Oh, man. I'm gonna catch hell
if I don't collect. You got to let me try.

174
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,310
L'll tell you what. I got an extra medium.
Take it on the house.

175
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,912
- You are the man.
- God bless you, brother.

176
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,429
All right.

177
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,869
Okay.

178
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,675
We're pretty well closed here, folks.
I'm sorry.

179
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,069
Oh, come on, Stan. It's Friday night.

180
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,838
Oh, kids.

181
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,390
I got nothing but marinara now.

182
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,436
Oh, I got to have a Mister Pink, please.

183
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,636
She worked through dinner again,
of course.

184
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,109
Stan?

185
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,632
And he... I go, " So, yeah,
I mean, where were you?

186
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,676
"I can't... I don't know
where you were, Cecil."

187
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,149
And he goes, "Not where you been at."

188
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,789
I thought, "Oh, my God." I just felt so awful.

189
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,593
Bruce?

190
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,832
Betty? What's going on?

191
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,629
Betty...

192
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,678
Just tell me if I saw what I think I saw.

193
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,469
- I don't know what to say.
- Please, just tell me the truth.

194
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,674
Don't go. Don't go.

195
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,997
I want you to come with me now.

196
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,196
Please. Come with me.

197
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,754
Please.

198
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,119
It's our data.

199
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,918
I got in there before they carted it all away.

200
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,595
I hoped somewhere that it might tell us
something someday.

201
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:04,311
- Does the General know that you have this?
- No, I don't think so.

202
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,630
I haven't spoken to him in a couple of years.

203
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,153
You have to be sure.

204
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:13,075
Bruce, I don't understand why we can't
just go in there together and talk to him.

205
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,915
He told me what he wanted to do.
He wants it out of me.

206
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,117
He wants to dissect it
so that he can replicate it.

207
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,270
He wants to make it a weapon.

208
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,348
- Hi.
- Hi.

209
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,194
- I thought you might want to...
- Thanks.

210
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,436
Listen, I should leave early,
as early as I can.

211
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,796
Really? You can't stay at all?

212
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,077
I want to,
but it's just not safe for me to be here.

213
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,159
- If I could borrow some cash...
- Of course.

214
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,798
I need to take a bus.

215
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,474
Well, at least let me walk you to the station.

216
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,429
Okay.

217
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,509
- You have everything you need?
- Yeah.

218
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,595
I...

219
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,995
What?

220
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,271
- Good night.
- Good night.

221
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,271
I hope you get some rest.

222
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,194
We're giving you a very low dose only.

223
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,080
I need you sharp out there and disciplined.

224
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,071
First sign of any side effect,

225
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,675
we stop and you're off team
until you straighten out.

226
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,112
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

227
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,519
You'll get two separate infusions.

228
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,639
One into the deep muscle,
one into the bone marrow centres.

229
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,915
The bone ones are going to hurt.

230
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,312
Is everything okay?

231
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,519
I think so.

232
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,834
Come here.

233
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,396
- I just wanna do this.
- Oh.

234
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,516
- It's better like that.
- Yeah?

235
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,553
It feels too tight, huh?

236
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,358
- Yeah, a little.
- Okay.

237
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,398
- What?
- They're here.

238
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,073
- Betty, look at me, look at me!
- Bruce!

239
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,354
You have to go far away
from me as you can!

240
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,873
- Don't argue with me, just go. Go!
- Bruce!

241
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,636
Damn it! We'd have had snipers on target
in three more minutes.

242
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,199
I wanna know who jumped the gun.

243
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,509
He's heading 2-7-0.

244
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,552
Blonsky! Not yet!

245
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,075
Sir.

246
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,198
Look alive. This could get interesting.

247
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,275
I got him!

248
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,518
Stop! Stop!

249
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,599
I know you're in there!

250
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,918
General, please!

251
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,309
Sir?

252
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,955
Dad!

253
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:31,079
- Dad, please don't do this.
- You can't see this clearly. Now, get inside.

254
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,912
There he is!

255
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,116
Target is in the overpass. We have a visual.

256
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,270
Do not engage! Repeat, do not engage!

257
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,239
He's locked in.

258
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,479
Put two canisters in there with him.

259
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,149
Fire!

260
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,595
Get her back here!

261
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,669
Now she'll see.

262
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,669
Alpha team?

263
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,635
Let him have all of it.

264
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,073
Come on, light him up!

265
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,397
Where are the fifty cals? Move your asses!

266
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,749
Oh, my God!

267
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,229
Blonsky, now you're up!

268
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,989
Sir?

269
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,348
Cover me.

270
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,153
Remember me?

271
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,639
My God, he's doing it.

272
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,754
Move him toward the cannons!

273
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,675
Move!

274
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,834
Hold your position!

275
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,194
Do it now!

276
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,479
Please, please, please, no!

277
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,913
- Please, please, please!
- Get her back!

278
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:58,989
You're killing him!

279
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,310
Stop! Get off of me!

280
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,753
Bruce!

281
00:53:37,815 --> 00:53:39,274
Where's the gunship?

282
00:53:58,341 --> 00:53:59,376
Is that it?

283
00:53:59,581 --> 00:54:01,299
Blonsky, pull back now.

284
00:54:01,381 --> 00:54:02,609
Pull back!

285
00:54:05,621 --> 00:54:07,339
Is that all you got?

286
00:54:14,581 --> 00:54:17,049
- Fall back!
Fall back! Let's go, let's go!

287
00:54:17,141 --> 00:54:18,461
Find cover!

288
00:54:22,302 --> 00:54:23,451
Betty!

289
00:54:36,382 --> 00:54:37,815
Fire, goddamn it!

290
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:40,691
Bruce?

291
00:54:53,342 --> 00:54:54,491
Stop firing!

292
00:55:07,503 --> 00:55:08,856
No!

293
00:55:56,944 --> 00:55:59,378
You did the right thing, calling us.

294
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:04,222
I need to know where they're going.

295
00:56:04,304 --> 00:56:06,374
She'll be in incredible danger
as long as she's with him.

296
00:56:06,464 --> 00:56:07,692
From who?

297
00:56:08,544 --> 00:56:11,058
He protected her. You almost killed her.

298
00:56:11,144 --> 00:56:14,739
I give you my word, her safety
is my main concern at this point.

299
00:56:14,824 --> 00:56:17,418
You know, it's a point
of professional pride with me

300
00:56:17,504 --> 00:56:20,303
that I can always tell
when somebody's lying.

301
00:56:20,625 --> 00:56:21,660
And you are.

302
00:56:22,905 --> 00:56:25,055
I don't know where he's going.

303
00:56:25,985 --> 00:56:29,978
- I know she'll help him, if she can.
- Then she's aiding a fugitive.

304
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:33,659
And I can't help either one of them.

305
00:56:38,505 --> 00:56:41,463
I used to wonder
why she never talked about you.

306
00:56:41,825 --> 00:56:43,144
Now I know!

307
00:56:47,865 --> 00:56:50,095
Where does she meet these guys?

308
00:57:37,586 --> 00:57:38,701
Bruce?

309
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:49,622
Bruce.

310
00:58:08,987 --> 00:58:11,057
It's okay. It's okay.

311
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:26,307
Come here. Come this way.

312
00:58:29,388 --> 00:58:30,946
Watch your head.

313
00:58:45,428 --> 00:58:46,497
Okay.

314
00:58:56,868 --> 00:58:57,983
We're okay.

315
00:59:02,709 --> 00:59:04,028
It's okay.

316
00:59:05,789 --> 00:59:07,427
It's just the rain.

317
00:59:16,309 --> 00:59:18,425
Will he ever walk again?

318
00:59:18,509 --> 00:59:21,945
Most of the bones in his body
look like crushed gravel right now.

319
00:59:22,029 --> 00:59:25,658
I will say this for him.
He's got a heart like a machine.

320
00:59:25,749 --> 00:59:28,821
Never seen anything like it,
outside of a racehorse.

321
01:00:28,831 --> 01:00:29,900
Here.

322
01:00:31,391 --> 01:00:32,506
Okay.

323
01:01:11,512 --> 01:01:12,661
Bruce?

324
01:01:14,112 --> 01:01:15,306
Oh, hi.

325
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:16,941
Are you okay?

326
01:01:17,552 --> 01:01:18,621
Yeah.

327
01:01:18,832 --> 01:01:20,982
Yeah, actually, I feel a lot better.

328
01:01:21,072 --> 01:01:23,540
- Good.
- I just had to get my data back.

329
01:01:25,032 --> 01:01:26,101
You ate it?

330
01:01:26,192 --> 01:01:30,265
Well, you know, the circumstances
called for a little improvisation.

331
01:01:30,352 --> 01:01:31,387
Wow.

332
01:01:32,832 --> 01:01:36,984
Okay, so they didn't have a great selection,
but I got you some options.

333
01:01:37,072 --> 01:01:39,540
First thing's first.

334
01:01:39,632 --> 01:01:41,190
Oh, you're kidding me.

335
01:01:51,033 --> 01:01:52,102
What?

336
01:01:52,673 --> 01:01:55,392
- No.
- They were the stretchiest pair they had.

337
01:01:55,473 --> 01:01:56,747
L'll take my chances.

338
01:01:56,953 --> 01:01:59,342
Rumours continue
to swirl about a violent clash

339
01:01:59,433 --> 01:02:03,062
between forces of the US military
and an unknown adversary

340
01:02:03,153 --> 01:02:05,986
on the campus of Culver University
earlier today.

341
01:02:06,073 --> 01:02:09,190
Sophomores Jack McGhee and Jim Wilson
witnessed some of the battle.

342
01:02:09,273 --> 01:02:10,672
It was so big.

343
01:02:10,753 --> 01:02:13,506
- It was like this huge, like, hulk!
- Yeah.

344
01:02:13,593 --> 01:02:16,505
McGhee, who happens
to be a reporter for the campus paper,

345
01:02:16,593 --> 01:02:18,231
captured this on his cell phone.

346
01:02:18,313 --> 01:02:19,951
Further search for the mysterious "hulk"

347
01:02:20,033 --> 01:02:24,346
was postponed by powerful thunderstorms
in the Smoky Mountain National Forest.

348
01:02:31,554 --> 01:02:34,387
Not too short back there.

349
01:02:34,474 --> 01:02:36,829
I have done this before, you know.

350
01:02:52,074 --> 01:02:54,542
I don't know how you've done this
on your own for all this time.

351
01:02:54,634 --> 01:02:56,465
With clippers, usually.

352
01:03:49,076 --> 01:03:51,670
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
- What? What?

353
01:03:51,756 --> 01:03:53,075
We can't do this.

354
01:03:53,156 --> 01:03:55,147
- It's okay. I want to.
- No.

355
01:03:56,156 --> 01:03:57,191
No.

356
01:03:58,316 --> 01:03:59,510
I can't.

357
01:04:02,916 --> 01:04:04,827
I can't get too excited.

358
01:04:07,436 --> 01:04:09,427
Not even a little excited?

359
01:04:11,996 --> 01:04:13,315
It's okay.

360
01:04:17,796 --> 01:04:19,593
Sir, it's Blonsky.

361
01:04:21,996 --> 01:04:24,795
Has anyone found out
if he has next of kin or family?

362
01:04:25,557 --> 01:04:27,149
Ask him yourself.

363
01:04:30,797 --> 01:04:31,832
Sir?

364
01:04:51,197 --> 01:04:55,031
- Good to see you back on your feet, soldier.
- Thank you, sir.

365
01:05:01,717 --> 01:05:02,911
How do you feel?

366
01:05:04,797 --> 01:05:07,107
Pissed off and ready for round three.

367
01:05:13,278 --> 01:05:17,112
Basically, we can't use any of this,
because they can track all of it.

368
01:05:17,198 --> 01:05:19,871
Well, my lip gloss? Can they track that?

369
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:23,790
- No. You can take your lip gloss.
- Thank you.

370
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:26,676
- Well, I need my glasses.
- Well, you can take

371
01:05:26,758 --> 01:05:27,873
- your glasses and your watch, okay?
- Okay.

372
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:31,428
We can use most of it. We just can't use
the credit cards, the ID or the phone.

373
01:05:31,518 --> 01:05:33,713
- Don't even turn that on.
- Okay.

374
01:05:33,838 --> 01:05:35,874
And we'll take the cash, obviously.

375
01:05:35,958 --> 01:05:39,712
How will we get where we need to go
on $40 and no credit cards?

376
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:45,391
Well, we could sell this.

377
01:05:45,479 --> 01:05:48,869
No. No, that's the only thing
you have left from her. No.

378
01:05:50,999 --> 01:05:53,593
Well, we'll have to try and get it back.

379
01:05:54,239 --> 01:05:56,070
Federal is
already monitoring phones,

380
01:05:56,159 --> 01:05:58,309
plastic and Dr Ross's web accounts,

381
01:05:58,399 --> 01:06:00,549
and local PD have been placed on alert.

382
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:03,199
They'll pop up somewhere
and when they do, it comes straight to us.

383
01:06:03,279 --> 01:06:05,156
They're not gonna just pop up.

384
01:06:05,239 --> 01:06:08,151
He made it five years and got across borders
without making any mistakes.

385
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:09,991
He's not gonna use a damn credit card now.

386
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:12,071
If he was trying to escape,
he'd be long gone.

387
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:13,274
He's not trying to escape this time.

388
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:15,748
He's looking for help
and that's how we're gonna get him.

389
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:18,148
We know what they're after and we know
he's been talking to somebody.

390
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,991
You all have copies of the correspondence.

391
01:06:20,479 --> 01:06:22,435
The aliases Mr Green and Mr Blue

392
01:06:22,519 --> 01:06:24,555
have been added to the
SHIELD Operations Database.

393
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:27,158
If he comes up for air, we'll be waiting.

394
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,476
If he makes a peep, we'll hear him.

395
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,869
And when he slips up, we'll be ready.

396
01:07:14,001 --> 01:07:15,070
Hey.

397
01:07:16,841 --> 01:07:17,990
Smile.

398
01:07:28,001 --> 01:07:29,593
What is it like?

399
01:07:31,441 --> 01:07:34,080
When it happens, what do you experience?

400
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:37,269
Remember those experiments
we volunteered for at Harvard?

401
01:07:37,361 --> 01:07:39,352
Those induced hallucinations?

402
01:07:40,081 --> 01:07:43,357
It's a lot like that,
just a thousand times amplified.

403
01:07:45,121 --> 01:07:48,876
It's like someone's poured
a litre of acid into my brain.

404
01:07:48,962 --> 01:07:53,592
- Do you remember anything?
- Just fragments. Images.

405
01:07:54,082 --> 01:07:57,119
There's too much noise.
I can never derive anything out of it.

406
01:07:57,202 --> 01:08:00,638
- But then it's still you inside it.
- No. No, it's not.

407
01:08:02,962 --> 01:08:06,955
I don't know.
In the cave, I really felt like it knew me.

408
01:08:07,682 --> 01:08:09,035
Maybe your mind is in there,

409
01:08:09,122 --> 01:08:11,636
it's just overcharged
and can't process what's happening.

410
01:08:11,722 --> 01:08:14,873
I don't want to control it.
I want to get rid of it.

411
01:08:27,563 --> 01:08:28,962
Are you ready?

412
01:08:29,043 --> 01:08:30,715
Let's even the playing field a little.

413
01:08:34,003 --> 01:08:35,231
Gentlemen.

414
01:08:39,043 --> 01:08:42,558
Bruce, wake up.
There's something going on.

415
01:08:53,203 --> 01:08:56,115
We got to go. Walk toward the back.
Just don't move too fast.

416
01:09:10,964 --> 01:09:12,522
All right. Come.

417
01:09:25,764 --> 01:09:29,916
It is a long way uptown.
I think the subway's probably quickest.

418
01:09:30,764 --> 01:09:32,595
Me in a metal tube, deep underground,

419
01:09:32,684 --> 01:09:35,039
with hundreds of people
in the most aggressive city in the world?

420
01:09:35,124 --> 01:09:37,684
Right. Let's get a cab.

421
01:09:37,764 --> 01:09:41,803
Come on, now! Let's go!
You're too slow! You drive like a woman!

422
01:09:46,524 --> 01:09:48,037
- Very nice. You see her?
- Oh, my.

423
01:09:48,124 --> 01:09:51,117
Very pretty. Watch out, you goat!

424
01:09:51,205 --> 01:09:53,161
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

425
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:58,885
Are you out of your mind?

426
01:09:58,965 --> 01:10:00,239
- What is wrong with you?
- What's the matter, baby?

427
01:10:00,325 --> 01:10:01,963
You don't like a good ride?

428
01:10:03,725 --> 01:10:04,919
Asshole!

429
01:10:07,925 --> 01:10:10,314
You know, I know a few
techniques could help you

430
01:10:10,405 --> 01:10:14,444
- manage that anger very effectively.
- You zip it. We're walking.

431
01:10:14,845 --> 01:10:15,834
Okay.

432
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:24,962
Excuse me. Dr Sterns?

433
01:10:25,045 --> 01:10:27,479
- Yes.
- I'm sorry to bother you. I'm Elizabeth Ross.

434
01:10:28,365 --> 01:10:30,277
Oh! Dr Ross!

435
01:10:30,366 --> 01:10:33,164
- I have someone who'd like to meet you.
- Okay.

436
01:10:35,566 --> 01:10:36,965
It's Mr Blue, isn't it?

437
01:10:38,726 --> 01:10:40,045
Mr Green?

438
01:10:42,206 --> 01:10:45,721
I got to tell you,
I've been wondering if you were even real.

439
01:10:45,806 --> 01:10:47,478
And if you were, what would it look like?

440
01:10:47,566 --> 01:10:52,037
A person with that much
power lurking in him.

441
01:10:52,126 --> 01:10:53,684
Nothing could have surprised me more

442
01:10:53,766 --> 01:10:56,519
than this unassuming man
shaking my hand.

443
01:10:56,606 --> 01:10:59,166
But, look. We're not strolling
into the park for a picnic, here.

444
01:10:59,246 --> 01:11:00,838
Even if everything goes perfectly,

445
01:11:00,926 --> 01:11:04,601
if we induce an episode,
if we get the dosage exactly right,

446
01:11:05,566 --> 01:11:07,397
is that going to be a lasting cure

447
01:11:07,486 --> 01:11:10,684
or just some antidote to suppress
that specific flare-up?

448
01:11:12,887 --> 01:11:14,286
I don't know.

449
01:11:15,007 --> 01:11:19,523
What I'm saying is that if we overshoot this
by even the smallest integer

450
01:11:20,447 --> 01:11:25,123
we're dealing with concentrations
with extraordinary levels of toxicity.

451
01:11:25,207 --> 01:11:29,564
- You mean it could kill him.
- Kill him? Yeah. I should say so.

452
01:11:31,207 --> 01:11:33,243
You should know that there's
a flip side to this, too.

453
01:11:33,327 --> 01:11:36,717
If we miss on the low side,
if we induce me and it fails,

454
01:11:36,807 --> 01:11:39,162
this will be very dangerous for you.

455
01:11:40,887 --> 01:11:44,766
Look. I've always been
more curious than cautious,

456
01:11:44,847 --> 01:11:48,920
and that's served me pretty well.
So, are we going to do this?

457
01:12:41,729 --> 01:12:43,287
How you feeling, man?

458
01:12:44,969 --> 01:12:46,482
Like a monster.

459
01:13:05,569 --> 01:13:07,241
Okay. On the table.

460
01:13:07,969 --> 01:13:13,124
These will protect you from yourself
if you have a strong reaction.

461
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:17,163
You can tell me later
if you thought it was strong.

462
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:25,442
Oh, come on! Stupid graduate students.

463
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:30,959
Okay...

464
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:32,929
You, you, you.

465
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:37,800
This will be a somewhat novel sensation.

466
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:41,803
We have begun.

467
01:13:43,570 --> 01:13:46,482
The dialysis machine will mix the antidote
with your blood.

468
01:13:46,570 --> 01:13:50,848
Except the antidote will only take hold
once we've achieved a full reaction.

469
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:52,046
Just relax.

470
01:13:52,771 --> 01:13:55,968
Okay. We are comprehensive.

471
01:13:59,051 --> 01:14:00,450
Here you go.

472
01:14:10,051 --> 01:14:11,962
All right. We set to pop?

473
01:14:14,371 --> 01:14:16,441
I'd take your hands off him.

474
01:14:35,452 --> 01:14:37,408
Oh, my God!

475
01:14:50,932 --> 01:14:52,888
Wait, wait! There's more! Wait!

476
01:15:03,252 --> 01:15:05,720
- Now. Okay, now!
Wait.

477
01:15:05,812 --> 01:15:08,280
Now, do it! Do it!

478
01:15:15,493 --> 01:15:17,882
Bruce! Bruce, look at me.

479
01:15:17,973 --> 01:15:22,285
Stay with me. The antidote, now!
Sterns, do it now!

480
01:15:23,693 --> 01:15:27,527
Bruce, look at me. Look in my eyes.
Please, look in my eyes.

481
01:15:28,693 --> 01:15:31,002
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

482
01:15:49,813 --> 01:15:50,962
Bruce.

483
01:15:51,053 --> 01:15:52,372
Oh, my God.

484
01:16:03,294 --> 01:16:06,172
Bruce? Bruce, can you hear me?

485
01:16:10,054 --> 01:16:11,169
Bruce?

486
01:16:19,654 --> 01:16:22,885
It's okay. You're okay. You're okay.

487
01:16:26,174 --> 01:16:27,493
You did it.

488
01:16:27,654 --> 01:16:30,214
He's fine. This is fantastic.

489
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:31,568
It's over.

490
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:33,490
Hi.

491
01:16:33,815 --> 01:16:34,884
Hi.

492
01:16:42,895 --> 01:16:48,606
That was the most extraordinary thing
I have seen in my entire life!

493
01:16:48,695 --> 01:16:50,208
Okay, you know what? Stop, please.

494
01:16:50,295 --> 01:16:52,570
We need to go back and talk
about what just happened in there.

495
01:16:52,655 --> 01:16:56,284
Absolutely. Okay. The gamma pulse
came from the amygdala.

496
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:58,047
- I think Dr Ross's primer...
- Are you okay?

497
01:16:58,135 --> 01:17:01,252
...lets the cells absorb the energy
temporarily, and then it abates.

498
01:17:01,335 --> 01:17:04,008
That's why you didn't die
of radiation sickness years ago!

499
01:17:04,095 --> 01:17:06,689
Now, maybe we've neutralised
those cells permanently,

500
01:17:06,775 --> 01:17:08,606
or maybe we just suppressed that event.

501
01:17:08,695 --> 01:17:10,925
I'm inclined to think the latter,
but it's hard to know

502
01:17:11,015 --> 01:17:12,733
because none of our
test subjects ever survived.

503
01:17:12,815 --> 01:17:14,374
- Of course, they weren't getting the primer!
- Wait, wait.

504
01:17:14,456 --> 01:17:15,809
- Wait, what did you just say?
- They weren't getting

505
01:17:15,896 --> 01:17:18,330
- the myostatin primer...
- No, no, no. Test subjects?

506
01:17:19,336 --> 01:17:21,008
What test subjects?

507
01:17:21,696 --> 01:17:22,685
Come with me.

508
01:17:39,096 --> 01:17:42,850
What's the activity level?
- Snipers are covering Alpha sector.

509
01:17:43,656 --> 01:17:45,009
We started on rats and mice,

510
01:17:45,096 --> 01:17:47,564
but it just completely fried them,
so we had to go bigger.

511
01:17:47,816 --> 01:17:50,808
And we still don't know which is more toxic,
the gamma or your blood.

512
01:17:50,896 --> 01:17:54,492
- What do you mean, my blood?
- Bruce, this is all you.

513
01:17:55,297 --> 01:17:59,131
You didn't send me much to work with,
so I had to concentrate it and make more.

514
01:17:59,217 --> 01:18:02,334
With a little more trial and error,
there's no end to what we can do!

515
01:18:02,417 --> 01:18:05,966
This is potentially Olympian!

516
01:18:06,057 --> 01:18:09,413
This gamma technology
has limitless applications.

517
01:18:09,497 --> 01:18:11,453
We'll unlock hundreds of cures.

518
01:18:11,537 --> 01:18:14,529
We will make humans
impervious to disease!

519
01:18:28,137 --> 01:18:29,729
No, no, we've got to destroy it.

520
01:18:30,177 --> 01:18:31,974
- Wait, what?
- All of it.

521
01:18:32,097 --> 01:18:33,416
Tonight. We're gonna incinerate it.

522
01:18:33,497 --> 01:18:35,648
- Is this the whole supply?
- What...

523
01:18:35,738 --> 01:18:37,217
We could get the Nobel for this!

524
01:18:37,298 --> 01:18:39,414
You don't understand
the power of this thing.

525
01:18:39,498 --> 01:18:42,012
It is too dangerous. It cannot be controlled.

526
01:18:42,658 --> 01:18:44,091
At your discretion, shooter.

527
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:45,577
Three of us!
This is Promethean fire!

528
01:18:45,658 --> 01:18:46,647
It's just...

529
01:18:46,738 --> 01:18:47,932
No shot.

530
01:18:51,138 --> 01:18:52,856
Blonsky's going in.

531
01:18:54,978 --> 01:18:57,731
Blonsky, stand down.
My daughter's in there!

532
01:19:00,218 --> 01:19:01,253
We have the antidote now.

533
01:19:01,338 --> 01:19:04,057
They don't want the antidote!
They want to make it a weapon!

534
01:19:10,658 --> 01:19:12,569
And if we let it go, we will never get it back.

535
01:19:12,778 --> 01:19:14,735
You don't know how powerful this thing is.

536
01:19:14,819 --> 01:19:16,730
I hate the government
just as much as anyone,

537
01:19:16,819 --> 01:19:18,537
but you're being a little paranoid,
don't you think?

538
01:19:26,019 --> 01:19:27,452
Bruce! Bruce!

539
01:19:29,099 --> 01:19:30,293
Get out.

540
01:19:33,419 --> 01:19:36,058
Where is it? Come on, where is it?

541
01:19:40,099 --> 01:19:41,691
Show him to me.

542
01:19:43,139 --> 01:19:44,367
Blonsky!

543
01:19:52,499 --> 01:19:53,534
Miss!

544
01:19:54,979 --> 01:19:56,299
Take this.

545
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:04,171
If you took it from me, I'm gonna
put you in a hole for the rest of your life.

546
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:10,815
Betty.

547
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:15,578
I will never forgive what you've done to him.

548
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:16,934
He's a fugitive.

549
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:18,897
You made him a fugitive

550
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:22,336
to cover your failures
and to protect your career.

551
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:25,819
Don't ever speak to me
as your daughter again.

552
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:31,336
It's only because you're my daughter
that you're not in handcuffs, too.

553
01:20:36,061 --> 01:20:37,210
Are you telling me
you can make more like him?

554
01:20:37,301 --> 01:20:41,852
No! Not yet. I sorted out a few pieces,
but it's not like I can put together

555
01:20:41,941 --> 01:20:45,138
the same Humpty Dumpty,
if that's what you're asking.

556
01:20:45,221 --> 01:20:48,930
He was a freak accident!
The goal is to do it better!

557
01:20:49,021 --> 01:20:50,852
So Banner's the only...

558
01:20:54,501 --> 01:20:58,733
- She's an annoying bitch.
- Why are you always hitting people?

559
01:21:01,061 --> 01:21:05,930
Now what possibly could I have done
to deserve such aggression?

560
01:21:06,021 --> 01:21:08,615
It's not what you've done.
It's what you're gonna do.

561
01:21:09,541 --> 01:21:11,896
I want what you got out of Banner.
I want that.

562
01:21:15,261 --> 01:21:19,141
You look like you've got a little
something in you already, don't you?

563
01:21:20,422 --> 01:21:23,892
I want more.
You've seen what he becomes, right?

564
01:21:24,582 --> 01:21:25,731
I have.

565
01:21:26,662 --> 01:21:28,141
And it's beautiful.

566
01:21:28,942 --> 01:21:30,136
Godlike.

567
01:21:30,342 --> 01:21:31,980
Well, I want that.

568
01:21:34,062 --> 01:21:36,053
I need that. Make me that.

569
01:21:36,902 --> 01:21:39,780
I don't know what you've got
inside you already.

570
01:21:39,862 --> 01:21:41,375
The mix could be

571
01:21:41,982 --> 01:21:43,461
an abomination.

572
01:21:46,982 --> 01:21:49,701
I didn't say I was unwilling.

573
01:21:50,222 --> 01:21:53,817
I just need informed consent.

574
01:21:56,222 --> 01:21:57,941
And you've given it.

575
01:22:37,384 --> 01:22:41,457
This is what I was trying to explain.

576
01:22:41,544 --> 01:22:46,254
I don't know what you've been
ladling into yourself.

577
01:22:46,344 --> 01:22:48,335
But clearly it worked.

578
01:22:48,424 --> 01:22:51,894
Let's assume you don't understand
a word I'm saying,

579
01:22:51,984 --> 01:22:56,614
but if you'll just get back on the table,

580
01:22:56,704 --> 01:22:59,093
I can fix this.

581
01:23:13,384 --> 01:23:15,022
Shoot it!
Hey!

582
01:23:15,784 --> 01:23:16,819
No!

583
01:23:26,025 --> 01:23:27,981
Delta 4 to Leader.

584
01:23:28,065 --> 01:23:29,737
They took out two of our guys,
two of our guys!

585
01:23:29,825 --> 01:23:32,419
Blonsky and the Major are still inside!

586
01:23:35,185 --> 01:23:37,380
Come on! Move, move, move, move!

587
01:23:45,025 --> 01:23:46,538
It's over there!

588
01:23:48,265 --> 01:23:49,380
Drop them!

589
01:23:49,465 --> 01:23:51,615
What is that thing?
Shoot it!

590
01:24:00,706 --> 01:24:04,335
Okay. All right! You... You, drive!
Let's go! Move, move!

591
01:24:04,426 --> 01:24:05,700
Delta 4 to Leader!
Go, go, go, go, go!

592
01:24:05,786 --> 01:24:07,617
Something big
just went off down here!

593
01:24:08,146 --> 01:24:10,182
General, you should hear this!

594
01:24:10,266 --> 01:24:13,064
The Hulk is in the street!
I repeat, the Hulk is in the street!

595
01:24:15,546 --> 01:24:17,537
That's impossible.
You get a hold of yourself, young man.

596
01:24:17,626 --> 01:24:19,457
You get it together. What is your position?

597
01:24:19,706 --> 01:24:22,698
121st Street, heading north on Broadway!

598
01:24:22,786 --> 01:24:24,265
Turn us around.

599
01:24:30,946 --> 01:24:34,018
We're going back. Why are we going back?

600
01:24:34,106 --> 01:24:35,664
Damn it! Give me eyes down there!

601
01:24:36,066 --> 01:24:37,294
Yes, sir!

602
01:24:39,227 --> 01:24:41,058
What the hell was that?

603
01:24:41,387 --> 01:24:42,945
Go, go, go!

604
01:25:05,547 --> 01:25:06,741
No!

605
01:25:22,348 --> 01:25:23,622
One of yours?

606
01:25:23,868 --> 01:25:26,826
Oh, my God. What have you done?

607
01:25:29,068 --> 01:25:30,820
Fire at him, fire at him!

608
01:25:34,988 --> 01:25:36,979
Do you think a rifle's gonna hurt that?

609
01:25:37,388 --> 01:25:38,582
Come on!

610
01:25:41,948 --> 01:25:43,063
Sweet.

611
01:25:45,868 --> 01:25:47,017
Booyah!

612
01:26:04,309 --> 01:26:05,583
Get out of there, soldier!

613
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:10,347
Stacy!

614
01:26:39,749 --> 01:26:41,581
Give me a real fight!

615
01:26:49,350 --> 01:26:50,465
Sir?

616
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:54,099
Sir?

617
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:58,468
Tell them to bring everything they've got
and head for Harlem.

618
01:27:01,710 --> 01:27:05,020
It has to be me.
You have to take me back there.

619
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:06,829
What are you saying?

620
01:27:06,990 --> 01:27:08,218
You think you can control it?

621
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:11,302
No, no, not control it,
but, I don't know, maybe aim it.

622
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:12,789
And what if you can't?

623
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:15,942
We made this thing.

624
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:17,704
All of us.

625
01:27:18,670 --> 01:27:19,819
Please.

626
01:27:24,591 --> 01:27:26,980
- Land us near it.
- No, no. No, keep us high.

627
01:27:28,511 --> 01:27:29,785
Open the back door.

628
01:27:35,311 --> 01:27:39,987
Bruce! Bruce, stop!
Stop! What are you doing?

629
01:27:40,071 --> 01:27:43,620
Think about this!
You don't even know if you'll change!

630
01:27:45,551 --> 01:27:48,623
You don't have to do this!
Please, this is insane!

631
01:27:48,711 --> 01:27:50,383
Betty, I've got to try.

632
01:27:52,471 --> 01:27:53,745
I'm sorry.

633
01:28:15,472 --> 01:28:17,064
Oh, shit!

634
01:28:20,912 --> 01:28:23,631
- Get her in here!
- Come on, miss.

635
01:28:40,352 --> 01:28:42,309
There. Betty!

636
01:29:00,593 --> 01:29:02,072
Hulk!

637
01:29:06,673 --> 01:29:08,311
Yeah!

638
01:29:50,754 --> 01:29:51,948
Come on!

639
01:30:22,875 --> 01:30:24,752
Is that all you've got?

640
01:30:37,915 --> 01:30:40,588
Use that thing, soldier! Give him some help!

641
01:30:40,675 --> 01:30:41,869
Which one?

642
01:30:41,955 --> 01:30:44,186
Help the green one, damn it!
Which one do you think?

643
01:30:44,276 --> 01:30:46,028
Cut the other one in half!

644
01:30:48,596 --> 01:30:49,711
Ross!

645
01:31:13,476 --> 01:31:15,148
Keep it on him!

646
01:31:42,197 --> 01:31:45,075
Look, I got to put it down!
Hang on!

647
01:32:49,559 --> 01:32:50,628
Dad?

648
01:32:53,159 --> 01:32:55,548
Are you hurt? Let me help you.

649
01:33:02,999 --> 01:33:04,796
I'm all right. Just find a way out.

650
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:57,074
You don't deserve this power!
Now watch her die!

651
01:34:45,722 --> 01:34:47,314
Look out!

652
01:35:16,882 --> 01:35:18,076
General?

653
01:35:24,082 --> 01:35:26,551
Any last words?

654
01:35:29,243 --> 01:35:32,519
Hulk smash!

655
01:36:18,124 --> 01:36:19,637
Stop!

656
01:37:37,086 --> 01:37:38,360
It's okay.

657
01:37:48,086 --> 01:37:49,678
Betty.

658
01:40:11,650 --> 01:40:12,924
Reload.

659
01:40:20,170 --> 01:40:21,319
Reload.

660
01:40:36,690 --> 01:40:39,727
The smell of stale beer and defeat.

661
01:40:39,810 --> 01:40:41,482
You know, I hate to say,
"I told you so," General,

662
01:40:41,570 --> 01:40:45,802
but that Super Soldier programme
was put on ice for a reason.

663
01:40:45,890 --> 01:40:48,643
I've always felt hardware was more reliable.

664
01:40:48,850 --> 01:40:51,046
- Stark.
- General.

665
01:40:53,291 --> 01:40:55,680
You always wear such nice suits.

666
01:40:56,611 --> 01:40:57,885
Touch?

667
01:40:58,771 --> 01:41:02,320
- I hear you have an unusual problem.
- You should talk.

668
01:41:02,411 --> 01:41:03,844
You should listen.

669
01:41:06,411 --> 01:41:09,767
What if I told you
we were putting a team together?

670
01:41:09,851 --> 01:41:11,364
Who's "we"?

671
01:41:13,727 --> 01:41:21,240
THE END
