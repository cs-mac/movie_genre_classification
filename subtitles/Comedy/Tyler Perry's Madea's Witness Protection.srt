Hey, you just...

14
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,380
Hi, donny.

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,990
Hey...

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,870
Carter.

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,080
Right. How much?

18
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:01,510
Oh, no, no, no. 
 No charge. 
 A deal's a deal.

19
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,160
Free bait in exchange 
 for never having to 
 take the bus again.

20
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,540
Great.

21
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,270
Carter, talk to you 
 for a second?

22
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,740
Yeah.

23
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,640
So, did he ask you 
 to that homecoming 
 dance thing yet?

24
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,980
Dad! Don't 
 embarrass me.

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,680
I'm your dad, it's 
 my job. Come home 
 right after school.

26
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,980
We got a lot of work 
 to do around here.

27
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,080
Yeah.

28
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,720
What are you 
 doing here?

29
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,660
Donny's driving us until 
 I get my new ride. 
 Isn't that sweet?

30
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,710
That's sweet. 
 There's no room for me.

31
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,950
Sure there is. 
 Come on, climb in.

32
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,690
No, she's right. Brooke's 
 already wrinkling my 
 after-lunch outfit.

33
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,440
No, I'm not!

34
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,440
Chelsea, this 
 is high school, 
 not Vegas.

35
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,760
You don't need 
 a costume change.

36
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,890
Right.

37
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,630
But you might wanna 
 think about it.

38
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,630
(chuckles)

39
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,270
I'm sorry, Carter. 
 Hey, thanks for the bait.

40
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,890
See you. 
 Bye.

41

46
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,630
I can't stand them. 
 They're such princesses.

47
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,410
You said that like 
 it's a bad thing.

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,430
Carter, they're teenage 
 girls. They're probably 
 just jealous.

49
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,730
Yeah, I'm pretty 
 sure they're not.

50
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,270
(cell phone ringing)

51
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,370
It's Mason. Yes, sir.

52
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,130
No, sir.

53
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,830
Right away.

54
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,070
You're leaving again?

55
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,250
Two days, Max. 
 It's no big deal. 
 It's just a routine op.

56
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,990
Yeah, that's what 
 you always say.

57
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,890
Just be careful. Okay?

58
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,410
Always.

59
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,610
You and me, pal.

60
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,400
You and me, dad.

61
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:52,440
Dimitri: Her royal highness, 
 Rosalinda Marie Montoya Fiore.

62
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,050
<i>Princesa de</i> Costa Luna.

63
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,150
And you're walking, 
 and walking

64
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,790
As your adoring 
 subjects welcome 
 you.

65
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,990
Dimitri, my coronation 
 is one month away.

66
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,060
Why do we have 
 to practice now?

67
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,490
Ah!

68
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,200
The rehearsal is 
 so that everything 
 will be perfect.

69
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:20,870
<i>Princesa,</i> what a beautiful 
 coronation dress 
 you are wearing.

70
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,210
Who, may I ask, 
 designed it?

71
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,140
You did, Mr. Elegante.

72
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,450
So I did. 
 I am brilliant, no?

73
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,360
(laughing) yes.

74
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,920
Sophia: Thank you 
 for coming to help 
 Rosalinda.

75
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,870
Now that my husband 
 has passed away,

76
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,970
Only she can become 
 Queen of Costa Luna.

77
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,470
But it is so much 
 for someone so young.

78
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,880
And I'm afraid 
 that general Kane will 
 take advantage of that.

79
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,620
No, I'll be here, 
 Sophia. I'll protect 
 her like she's my own.

80
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,490
I know you will, 
 major Mason. 
 I know you will.

81
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,550
(coronation music playing)

82
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,490
Sounds like your music.

83
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,160
(Rosalinda speaking Spanish)

84
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,450
Turn to face your 
 subjects, Rosalinda.

85
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,190
Honored guests, 
 family, friends,

86
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,400
I present to you 
 <i>princesa</i> Rosalinda 
 Marie Montoya Fiore,

87
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,050
Heir to the throne 
 of Costa Luna.

88
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,330
She is willing 
 to be your Queen.

89
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,220
If any person has 
 a reason to object,

90
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,270
Let them come forward 
 and be heard!

91
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,030
(all gasping)

92
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,660
I object.

93
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,670
The <i>princesa</i> is too 
 young to be Queen.

94
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,840
Costa Luna and 
 Costa Estrella are 
 two tiny countries

95
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,080
Who must unite 
 and stand together 
 against the world.

96
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:55,370
Therefore, for the good 
 of both our countries, 
 I, general magnus Kane,

97
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:00,200
Declare myself <i>el presidente</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>de la republica</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>de las Costas.</i>

98
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,390
(all exclaiming)

99
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,090
Seize them!

100
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,560
(all shouting)

101
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,850
(grunting)

102
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,560
What? 
 The time is now.

103
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,910
Go now with 
 major Mason. 
 Go now!

104
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,180
Archbishop: 
 Hurry, my Queen, 
 we must go now.

105
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,020
Who are you? 
 Where are you 
 taking me?

106
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,770
I'm here to protect you, 
 but you need to trust me.

107
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,990
But what about 
 my mother?

108
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,060
She's going to meet us, 
 but we need to hurry.

109
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,720
Are you all right, <i>mama?</i> 
 <i> Yes, yes, darling, yes.</i>

110
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,630
I knew general Kane 
 would try something 
 like this,

111
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,560
So I made a plan 
 to protect you.

112
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,500
You must trust 
 major Mason. You must 
 do everything he says.

113
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,900
Do you promise me 
 you will do that?

114
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,530
Yes, <i>mama,</i> I promise. 
 Joe: We need to move.

115
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,520
Okay. Come on. 
 <i>Mama,</i> where are we going?

116
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,170
No, not "we," <i>mija.</i> 
 <i> You.</i>

117
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,340
The general will 
 say you abandoned 
 the country,

118
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,010
But I must stay, 
 so the people know

119
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,190
That you will return 
 when it's safe.

120
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,160
No! Not without you.

121
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,270
Here.

122
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,870
So, no matter what 
 happens, you never 
 forget you are a Princess.

123
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,800
Don't worry, <i>mi Reina</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>bonita,</i> we will be 
 together very soon.

124
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,490
(guards shouting)

125
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,590
We gotta go now. 
 Let's go.

126
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,560
(helicopter blades whirring)

127
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,090
Joe: Hurry up! Inside!

128
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,150
Go!

129
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,250
You will never find her.

130
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,520
And as long as 
 she remains free,

131
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,140
There will be hope 
 in Costa Luna.

132
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,260
I could not agree more.

133
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,580
But the <i>princesa</i> 
 <i> is only a girl, madam.</i> 
 <i> She will contact her mother.</i>

134
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,780
And when she does, 
 I will bring her 
 back to Costa Luna,

135
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,850
Where she will 
 rot with her mother 
 in a tiny dirt cell.

136
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,540
You will both become 
 a tragic symbol of futility 
 to those who would defy me.

137
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,390
Take her away!

138
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,630
What is this place?

139
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,800
You'll see.

157
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,220
<i>Until you're ready</i> 
 <i>for stage four.</i>

158
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,950
Stage four? 
 What is stage one?

159
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,810
<i>Extraction. That is</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>what brought you here.</i>

160
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,020
Stage two?

161
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,070
<i>Transition.</i>

162
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,480
Transition to what?

163
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,640
<i>Stage three.</i>

164
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,310
<i>Come inside,</i> 
 <i>why don't you?</i>

165
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,030
<i>And I will</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>explain everything.</i>

166
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,240
Welcome, Rosalinda, 
 to the operational heart

167
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,410
Of the Princess 
 protection program,

168
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,580
A top-secret agency 
 funded by the world's 
 royal families.

169
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:32,250
We are actively 
 providing protection 
 to 29 princesses,

170
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,640
All of whom have 
 been threatened in 
 one way or another.

171
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,970
(machinery beeping)

172
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,410
Chloe, may I? 
 Of course, director.

173
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,550
Director: 
 This is Princess chandra.

174
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,730
Last January, 
 major Mason rescued her from 
 a politically-motivated coup.

175
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,800
We have placed her where 
 no one will find her.

176
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,670
(tapping on keyboard)

177
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,930
Let's just say she's 
 a little farther north 
 than she's used to.

178
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,960
She is freezing!

179
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,810
Probably. 
 But she's safe.

180
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,330
Let's take a walk, 
 shall we?

181
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,050
Please.

182
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,160
Chloe, report.

183
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,410
"Princess 383 has had 
 a successful extraction.

184
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,180
"she arrives 
 at 0100 hours.

185
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,820
"Princess 299 is still 
 rejecting all attempts 
 at transformation.

186
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:27,170
"and Princess 107 
 is in need of our 
 services."

187
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,430
Rosalinda: What about me? 
 Where are you sending me?

188
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,350
Nowhere yet.

189
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,290
First you must go 
 through stage three, 
 transformation.

190
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,060
First, we start 
 with the hair and 
 then the wardrobe,

191
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,460
Until you are 
 unrecognizable 
 as princesses.

192
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,000
(greeting in 
 foreign language)

193
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,690
No! Stop!

194
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,810
I do not know 
 any of you people.

195
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,720
I want to speak 
 with major Mason. 
 I only trust major Mason.

196
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,420
Is everything 
 all right?

197
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,570
Take me back 
 to my country.

198
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,930
Princess, I'm sorry, but 
 general Kane has taken 
 control of your country

199
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,740
And assumed command 
 of its government.

200
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:37,990
But I must go back.

201
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,330
And you will.

202
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,470
As soon as we find 
 a legal way to 
 remove him.

203
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,780
In the meantime, 
 you have to let 
 us protect you.

204
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,250
But what about 
 my mother? Who's 
 protecting my mother?

205
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,440
You are. 
 As long as you're in 
 Princess Protection,

206
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,180
Your mom will 
 be safe. Please.

207
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,800
General Kane is hoping 
 you'll contact her

208
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,200
So he'll know 
 where to find you.

209
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,900
What if he does 
 find me?

210
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,320
He'll make an example 
 of you by sending 
 you to prison

211
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,950
Or a work farm.

212
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,160
And Costa Luna will 
 become part of his 
 own personal kingdom,

213
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,660
With its true royal family 
 nothing but a memory.

214
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,030
Bottom line,

215
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,530
If you care about 
 your country, and 
 your mom's safety,

216
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,270
Nobody can know 
 who you really are.

217
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,950
You may proceed.

218
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,010
Director: Good work.

219
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,710
From now on, you are 
 no longer Princess.

220
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,880
You are now Rosie Gonzalez, 
 an average American girl.

221
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,350
What happens now?

222
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,820
Stage four. 
 Relocation.

223
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,160
Where?

224
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,990
Somewhere where 
 general Kane 
 will never think

225
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,300
Of looking for 
 the Princess 
 of Costa Luna.

226
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,550
Joe: Welcome to 
 Louisiana, Rosie.

227
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,300
(car door slams)

228
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,850
(gasps)

229
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,900
Joe: Over here.

230
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,720
Welcome to your new home. 
 For a while, at least.

231
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,820
Here, let me 
 get the door.

232
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,490
(all chattering)

233
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,800
Here you go, sweetie.

234
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,570
Thanks, Helen.

235
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,270
Hey, looks like 
 someone's back 
 home again.

236
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,740
Carter: See you tomorrow!

237
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,500
Dad?

238
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,080
Dad?

239
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,290
Hello. 
 Hey.

240
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,580
Who are you? 
 Rosa... Rosie.

241
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,800
Are you sure? 'cause 
 you don't seem sure.

242
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,270
Rosie. I'm sure.

243
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,340
Okay. So, what are 
 you doing here?

244
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,260
Oh, major Mason 
 gave me this room.

245
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,510
He did, huh?

246
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,180
Yes, he's been 
 very lovely.

247
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,710
Lovely?

248
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,360
Of course, the suite 
 is much smaller than 
 I'm used to,

249
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,470
But it will feel much 
 larger once I have 
 that extra bed removed.

250
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,070
It's not extra, 
 it's mine.

251
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,290
Will you excuse 
 me for a second?

252
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,100
Yes. You are excused.

253
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,830
(door slams)

254
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,520
Joe: Hey, pal!

255
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,440
(scoffing) don't "pal" me.

256
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,130
You... You met Rosie?

257
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,580
Yeah. Who is she 
 and why is she 
 in my room?

258
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:56,050
Well, I had to bring 
 her here. The director 
 didn't give me a choice.

259
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,990
Okay. Just, you know, 
 a normal dad

260
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,120
Would go to 
 a foreign country 
 on a secret mission

261
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,630
And bring his daughter back 
 a T-shirt, not a person.

262
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,470
You should have 
 warned me.

263
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,940
Carter, I didn't have 
 a choice. She doesn't 
 trust anybody but me.

264
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,660
Yeah, I know the feeling.

265
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:22,380
Hey, what I do 
 is complicated.

266
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,810
But if I 
 thought for one second 
 it would hurt our family...

267
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,750
Dad, I get it.

268
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,900
So, you're in? 
 Do I have a choice?

269
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,860
Good, 'cause I'm gonna 
 need your help.

270
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,130
She needs to stay here 
 for a while, undetected.

271
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,490
And in order for 
 that to happen,

272
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,630
She has to blend in 
 as a normal American 
 teenager.

273
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,380
Yeah, no, that's not 
 gonna happen, dad. 
 She's a Princess.

274
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,100
Fine. Who do 
 I say she is?

275
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,120
Your cousin.

276
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,610
(scoffs)

277
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,760
Carter, thank you. 
 Now, if we do our 
 job right,

278
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,930
She'll be out of here 
 and back to her own 
 country in no time.

279
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Okay, so by Tuesday?

280
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,370
It'll be soon. 
 I promise.

281
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:03,950
Still you and me, 
 pal?

282
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,340
No.

283
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,360
Come on. Come on. Come on. 
 (giggling) no. No. No.

284
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,690
Is that right? 
 You're gonna go... 
 No!

285
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,260
...In the water if 
 you don't say yes. 
 Put me down.

286
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,410
Put me down. 
 All right.

287
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,770
You give me 
 a headache.

288
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,120
Be nice.

289
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,100
Mmm-hmm.

290
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,190
(door opens)

291
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,730
You have made 
 other sleeping 
 arrangements?

292
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:35,420
Look, the room is not 
 yours. It's ours. 
 We share it.

293
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,020
Share? 
 Share.

294
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,640
I know that's probably 
 a foreign concept 
 for a Princess,

295
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,830
But what it 
 means is that you get 
 one side of the room

296
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,160
And I get the other.

297
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,130
So stay on your side.

298
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,880
(slams)

299
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,140
Carter: I don't want that.

300
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,710
Joe: That's good.

301
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,250
So I thought princesses 
 had designer clothes 
 and stuff.

302
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,780
Well, she had to 
 leave all that behind.

303
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:10,290
But I was thinking 
 you could, you know, 
 loan her some of your stuff.

304
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,570
(scoffs)

305
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,610
Yeah, sure. Why not?

306
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,160
Thank you. 
 Now, go try again.

307
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,080
I will after this hand.

308
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,800
No, now.

309
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,590
And don't look 
 at my cards.

310
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,880
(sighs)

311

(door opens)

312
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,400
All right, the kitchen's 
 closing. Last Chance 
 to eat something.

313
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,920
No, thank you. 
 I wish to sleep.

314
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,630
Okay.

315
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,160
You may help me 
 prepare for bed.

316
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,020
I "may"?

317
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,970
Yes.

318
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,670
I need a nightgown. 
 Preferably silk, 
 preferably pink.

319
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,810
Pink silk. Let me 
 see what I've got.

320
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,780
Here.

321
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,370
(speaking in Spanish)

322
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,660
Huh?

323
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,540
May I use your restroom?

324
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,690
Yeah, upstairs, 
 first door on the right.

325
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,530
(thanking in Spanish)

326
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,080
Okay, whatever.

327
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,720
(sighs)

328
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,060
(screams)

329
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,260
What happened?

330
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,130
Come on!

331
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,270
Do they not have 
 lizards where 
 you're from?

332
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,830
Maybe, but I never 
 see them. That is 
 why we have Henry.

333
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,110
You have a royal 
 reptile wrangler?

334
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,310
Yes. And you should 
 get one, too.

335
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,750
Good night.

336
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,940
She's gonna be okay.

337
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,090
No. She's gonna 
 be a royal pain.

338
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,110
(door opening)

339
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,130
Good morning. 
 Hey.

340
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,650
Joe: Hey.

341
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,890
Juice? 
 Yeah.

342
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,690
All right. 
 There you go. 
 Coffee done?

343
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,550
Good.

344
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,750
Don't be shy, Rosie. 
 Grab whatever looks good.

345
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,610
(car horn honking)

346
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,830
Bus is here. 
 Sure you don't 
 want a ride?

347
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,460
Yeah, I'll be fine. 
 You coming?

348
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:07,670
Where are we going?

349
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,020
School. You're 16. 
 You go to school.

350
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,420
School. Of course.

351
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,280
Goodbye.

352
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,470
Morning, honey. 
 Hey, Helen.

353
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,410
Helen: Whoa! 
 Who's this, now?

354
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,470
That's just my cousin.

355
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:35,830
You don't say.

356
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:36,880
Hello.

357
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,780
Well, aren't you a cutie?

358
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,500
I am Rosie.

359
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,880
And I am late. 
 Go ahead and grab 
 a seat, quick as you can.

360
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,900

Well, technically, no. 
 Not yet, anyway.

Nice. Honest. 
 I like it.

Rosie. 
 Rosie.

379
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,580

The Queen of homecoming? 
 What is this homecoming?

383
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:59,090
You don't... 
 You've never heard 
 of homecoming?

384
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,990
No. We have 
 no such thing 
 where I am from.

385
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,790
Really? Where's that?

I'm going to school. 
 Bye, guys.

389
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,570
Yes, and you're 
 supposed to act like 
 a normal American girl.

390
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,870
You're supposed 
 to blend in.

391
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,240
I'm trying. 
 Well, try harder.

392
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,460
There she is, 
 Princess Carter.

393

Sit down.

415
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,670
No. And there 
 will never be.

416
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:07,570
Now, now, now, now. 
 We must not be 
 so negative.

417
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,440
Perhaps... Perhaps 
 we should think happy 
 thoughts. Shall I begin?

418
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:18,210

And he is... 
 He's sitting 
 on a throne.

421
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,760
Royal subjects shower him 
 with adoration.

422
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:33,200
And what do you know? 
 They have crowned 
 him their king!

(Kane laughing)

424
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,700
You will never be 
 the king of Costa Luna, 
 not as long as I'm alive.

425
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:43,610
You are ruining 
 my happy thoughts. 
 Take her away.

00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:12,340
Eating a hamburger. 
 Have you ever 
 tried one?

470
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,270
Yes. And FYI, 
 they have hamburgers 
 in iowa.

471
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,040
Oh!

472
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,230
Right.

473
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,960
You're supposed 
 to be blending in.

474
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,430
I am blending.

475
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,750
Speaking fluent 
 French in class?

476
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,700
And eating hamburger 
 like you're having 
 tea with the Queen?

477
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:29,340
Well, how else 
 should it be eaten?

478
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,140
Like this.

479
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,530
The works.

480
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,000
There you go.

481
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,380
Mmm-hmm.

482
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,850
Stop.

483
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,780
Now.

484
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,530
Like this? 
 It's perfect.

485
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,830
<i>Can I have your</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>attention, please? I have</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>an announcement to make.</i>

486
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,340
<i>Can we sit down</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>and settle down,</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>please?</i>

487
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,190

00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,180
(girls cheering)

490
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,110
<i>These nominees must be girls</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>of exemplary character.</i>

491
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,560
<i>Kind, intelligent, honest,</i>

<i>Of the lake Monroe community.</i>

00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,620

<i>There's more, there's more.</i>

497

500
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,140
Boy: Yeah!

501
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,610
<i>Burkle: Thank you.</i>

502
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,730
You vote for 
 royalty here?

503
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,910
We're a democracy. 
 We're into voting.

504
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:47,600
So then, anyone 
 can be a Princess? 
 Even you?

505
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,950
Theoretically.

506
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,760
Excuse me, everyone. 
 May I have your 
 attention?

507
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,380
What are you doing? 
 Sit down! 
 No, no.

508
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,400
I would like to 
 nominate my cousin,

509
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,360
Carter Mason, 
 to be your Queen.

510
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:05,620
I think that she would 
 make an excellent ruler.

511
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,070
(sparse laughter)

512
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,470
Boy 1: (whoops) Carter?

513
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,440
Boy 2: Yeah, right.

514
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,540
Carter. Carter!

515
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,610
Girl: Carter? 
 That's hilarious.

516
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,910
Was that for real? 
 Wow!

517
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,400
Ed: Oh, man.

518
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,470
Looks like 
 I'm the Queen.

519
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,890
Rosalinda: Carter!

520
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,230
Carter! 
 Leave me alone.

521
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:32,080
I order you to stop.

522
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,300
You order me? 
 You order me.

523
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,970
I order you to 
 take a long walk 
 off a short pier.

524
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,790
You cannot order 
 me to do anything.

525
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,270
Wanna bet? 
 You're in my 
 kingdom now.

526
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,240
Okay, hey, hey, hey. 
 Whoa, whoa.

527
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,660
Whoa, 
 what's going on?

528
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,760
Dad, she can't do it. 
 She can't act normal.

529
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,900
I am normal. 
 Really? Okay.

530
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,100
So, a normal person 
 who has never seen 
 a hamburger before

531
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,850
Can order one 
 in six languages?

532
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,650
Really? You did that?

533
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,270
I always speak to 
 my staff in their 
 native tongue.

534
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,840
They're not your staff. 
 They're lunch ladies, 
 okay?

535
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,710
Dad, can't you see 
 that this isn't 
 gonna work?

536
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,390
Carter, it's gonna 
 work, okay?

537
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,960
We just have 
 to give it a 
 little time.

538
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,700
(grunts)

539
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,800
It'll work.

540
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,250
(crying)

541
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:54,630
<i>Man on radio:</i>

 <i> </i> <i>a scorcher again today...</i>

542
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:55,480
Hey, ernie. 
 Hi, Carter.

543
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,460
Hello. 
 Oh, great.

544
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:00,230
Good morning, Carter. 
 What are you doing?

545
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,270
Chores.

546
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,540
Chores? 
 I do not understand.

547
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,140
No, of course not.

548
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:10,580
Perhaps I could 
 learn this "chores." 
 you could teach me.

549
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,600
You know, 
 that's the best 
 idea you've had.

550
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,080
What must I do?

551
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,780
We'll start you off 
 easy. Inventory.

552
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:21,170
Inventory? 
 Counting.

553
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:29,440
You count what's in here, 
 and put it in here. 
 Have fun.

554
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:33,720
Oh! And when you're done, 
 there's a whole other 
 shelf, too.

555
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,500
One.

556
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,160
Everything okay?

557
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,360
Yeah. Just peachy.

558
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,860
You got the bow? 
 Uh-huh.

559
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,200
Stay above that line.

560
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,200
What line? 
 Right there.

561
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,470
Okay.

562
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,590
(clattering)

563
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,700
Carter, what's 
 Rosie doing in 
 the bait shop?

564
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,200
Chores.

565
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,730
(Rosalinda screams)

566
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,930
Dad.

567
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,020
Joe: Rosie!

568
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,690
Carter: Are you okay?

569
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,860
I'm all right.

570
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,530
I think I need to bathe.

571
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:41,730
Carter, why don't you 
 go on in and clean 
 this up, okay?

572
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,300
Why me? She's the 
 one who did it.

573
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:45,700
Come on, pal. 
 I'll help you.

574
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,210
All right, it... 
 It's not funny.

575
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,770
(giggling) yes. Come on.

576
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,440
You know it's 
 a little funny. 
 All right. Here. Go.

577
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,040
You wanna laugh, too. 
 No, I don't wanna laugh.

578
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,440
Yes, you do. 
 This is serious. 
 Come on.

579
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,510
What do you want 
 for dinner tonight?

580
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,730
Pizza.

581
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,920
Pizza? We had 
 pizza last night.

582
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,640
How about... 
 How about burgers?

583
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,670
How about this? 
 Pizza and burgers.

584
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,140
Pizza and burgers. 
 Yeah. I wanna do both.

585
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,710
One as an appetizer, 
 or just together?

586
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,610
I don't know.

587
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,890
I didn't know we still 
 had all that stuff.

588
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,020
What's all this?

589
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,420
A proper dinner.

590
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,040
To thank you for 
 helping me clean 
 up the mess

591
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,390
That I made in 
 your shop of bugs.

592
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,530
It's bait. 
 I'm aware.

593
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,610
Okay.

594
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,350
Here. Let me. 
 No, no.

595
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,220
Thank you, but tonight, 
 I serve you.

596
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,890
Well, I'm not gonna 
 say no to that.

597
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,240
It is for you.

598
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,590
For me? 
 Mmm-hmm.

599
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,280
To wear. Okay. Fine.

600
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,510
(snickers)

601
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,980
Come on, Carter.

602
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:53,220
So, you cook? 
 I thought you had 
 servants for that.

603
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,990
Actually, my mother 
 grew up a peasant.

604
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,160
(mouthing)

605
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,580
So she taught me 
 many family recipes.

606
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:06,420
(speaking Spanish)

607
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,340
Wow!

608
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:10,990
Yeah, that sounds 
 kind of fancy.

609
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,790
Why don't we just 
 order pizza?

610
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,780
No, it's chicken 
 and rice.

611
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,100
Fantastic. 
 Bring it on, Rosie.

612
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,530
(chuckles)

613
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,150
You know, I haven't had 
 a real home-cooked 
 meal since...

614
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,550
Forever.

615
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,950
Right.

616
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,490
Let's dig in!

617
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,060
How do you like it? 
 That...

618
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:35,150
That is really, really 
 good. Gee, I had no 
 idea you can cook.

619
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,400
Rosalinda: Thank you.

620
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,170
This is terrific. 
 You're wonderful.

621
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,550
Thank you. Would 
 you like a roll?

622
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,690
You made rolls, too? 
 Rosalinda: Yes.

623
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,860
I had no idea. 
 Yes.

624
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,210
Wow!

625
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,080
Must be nice to play 
 peasant for a day.

626
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,140
Would you excuse me?

627
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,480
You do not know me, 
 Carter.

628
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,400
What's the big deal?

629
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,340
You'll be back 
 with your servants

630
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:36,990
And your personal chef 
 and private tutors 
 soon enough.

631
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,150
How much did your 
 father tell you 
 about me?

632
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,100
Other than the obvious, 
 I think we're on 
 a need-to-know basis.

633
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:52,120
I think you need to know 
 that my name is Rosalinda 
 Marie Montoya Fiore,

634
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,730
And I am 
 a royal Princess.

635
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,310
(scoffs) no kidding.

636
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,510
I am from 
 a small island nation 
 called Costa Luna.

637
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,870
Never heard of it. 
 It is not on most maps.

638
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:05,540
It is very small, 
 very unimportant 
 to large countries,

639
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,340
But very important to me.

640
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,590
When my father died, 
 he left Costa Luna to me.

641
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,360
You don't have 
 to tell me...

642
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:31,680
One month 
 before my coronation, 
 our palace was attacked.

643
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:35,150
Your father 
 was very brave.

644
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,220
He risked his life 
 for you, I know.

645
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:42,090
That's his job. 
 He rescues poor, 
 oppressed princesses.

646
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,390
Did he tell you 
 we had to leave 
 my mother behind?

647
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:49,330
The man who invaded 
 Costa Luna now holds 
 her as a hostage.

648
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,370
I didn't know.

649
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,070
They told me my becoming 
 Rosie Gonzalez

650
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,210
Was the only way 
 to keep her safe.

651
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,290
Stop. It's okay.

652
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,290
Carter, whatever I did 
 to make you dislike me, 
 I am truly sorry.

653
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:07,080
I will try to blend in. 
 I will try to be from iowa.

654
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,600
It is the only way to 
 save my mother's life.

655
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,910
Let's just start over.

656
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,730
I would like that.

657
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,620
But you need 
 to lighten up on 
 this Princess stuff.

658
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,270
It's really annoying.

659
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:31,810
Absolutely. Please, I only 
 want to be this typical 
 American teenager.

660
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:34,910
You know what? 
 I think we can 
 arrange that.

661
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,900
I love this place! 
 What is it?

662
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:46,740
It's a bowling alley. 
 That's bowling.

663
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,140
Just do what I do

664
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,990
And don't draw 
 any attention to 
 yourself, please.

665
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,330
Right.

666
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,320
Thank you. 
 Sure.

667
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,320
Carter! How you doing? 
 Hi, ed.

668
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,110
Ed: Hi. How you 
 doing, Rosie?

669
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,520
I'm well, thank you.

670
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,110
What'll it be? 
 Bowling, please.

671
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,930
(chuckles) no kidding.

672
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,000
Five-and-a-half 
 coming up.

673
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,650
Thank you. 
 Sure.

674
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,610
What size? 
 Excuse me?

675
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,430
Your feet. What size?

676
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,210
(stammering)

677
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,650
I do not know. 
 All of my shoes 
 are made for me.

678
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,470
There's a shock. 
 Just get her 
 some shoes.

679
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,650
Okay.

680
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,290
Your highness.

681
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,260
Rosalinda: 
 Why, thank you, Edward.

682
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,870
It's Edwin, actually.

683
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:07,000
Edwin. That is 
 a wonderful name.

684
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:11,010
Thank you. 
 It's been a pleasure 
 serving you, milady.

685
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,280
All right. 
 Thank you, Romeo.

686
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,230
Okay.

687
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:18,850
You're not blending in. 
 Pick a ball.

688
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:19,850
Did you see that?

689
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,580
Yeah. Nobody ever 
 does that for us.

690
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:23,990
They do now.

691
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,290
(Chelsea clears throat)

692
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,910
Your shoe's untied.

693
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:29,270
Don't trip.

694
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,780
Oh!

695
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,750
Careful there.

696
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,890
Donny, you don't have 
 to carry that for her.

697
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,630
She can do it herself 
 like a normal person.

698
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,180
So I'll just 
 take this.

699
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,950
Whatever you say...

700
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:58,770
Carter.

701
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,100
Right.

702
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:05,980
So, donny is 
 your boyfriend?

703
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,560
What? No, no. 
 He's just a friend.

704
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:10,620
Rosalinda: 
 But he is very 
 special to you.

705
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,080
I see the way 
 you look at him.

706
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:15,470
It's the same way 
 that ed looks at you.

707
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:19,390
Okay, you're 
 obviously not from here, 
 so just bowl. You first.

708
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,090
How do I win?

709
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,260
You win by 
 knocking down 
 those white pins.

710
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,830
Okay, I'm ready.

711
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,520
What?

712
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:32,650
You may fire 
 at the target.

713
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,090
You may fire it 
 yourself.

714
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,430
(pins clattering)

715
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,940
Impossible.

716
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:58,760
Nice shot, Rosie!

717
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:19,700
You done already, 
 Carter?

718
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:22,720
Yeah. Our Lane's 
 getting a little 
 crowded.

719
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,630
You don't really 
 like your cousin, 
 do you?

720
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:35,770
No, it's... It's just... 
 She can be sometimes, 
 you know, a...

721
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,840
Princess. 
 She could win it all.

722
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,900
She is getting 
 really popular.

723
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:41,640
The vote is 
 on Monday.

724
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:43,740
We can't let her 
 get more popular 
 than we are.

725
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:47,180
There's only one 
 thing to do in a 
 situation like this.

726
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:52,580
Excuse me! Excuse me! Roe! 
 Excuse me! Excuse me! Roe.

727
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,520
You are such 
 a natural.

728
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:56,320
Will you show us 
 how to bowl 
 like that?

729
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:58,460
Of course. 
 But my name is Rosie.

730
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,290
Oh! Roe's our 
 nickname we 
 gave you.

731
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,860
We give all of our 
 friends nicknames. 
 She's chels.

732
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:07,600
And she's brookie 
 and you're roe. 
 You're one of us now.

733
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,520
Rosalinda: Carter? 
 Carter: What?

734
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:16,890
Why do you care so much 
 for this boy donny?

735
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,780
Who says I care 
 for him?

736
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:25,020
Fine. I've been totally 
 in love with him since, 
 like, the third grade,

737
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,550
When he kissed me under 
 the basketball hoop.

738
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,650
Is that what 
 you want to hear?

739
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,970
He is quite beautiful.

740
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,470
Much like a prince.

741
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:34,760
I wonder if 
 he is beautiful on 
 the inside as well.

742
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,860
Shall we bowl 
 again tomorrow?

743
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:40,900
I can't. I'm working 
 at the bait shack.

744
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:42,820
I've never worked before. 
 Is this normal?

745
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:45,050
Yes. Lots of kids 
 have jobs.

746
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:47,310
Then I will help you. 
 You can't.

747
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,120
Why not? 
 Because it's mine.

748
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:51,680
You can't have 
 everything that's mine!

749
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:55,610
Well, just... 
 Want a job so bad? 
 Just go get one yourself.

750
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,330
All right.

751
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,690
Good night, Carter.

752
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:20,670
Thank you for 
 giving me this 
 job, Chelsea.

753
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:24,310
No prob, roe. Daddy owns, 
 like, 17 udderlys 
 all over the south.

754
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,580
He's the king.

755
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,180
Your father is a king?

756
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,180
Of frozen yogurt. 
 One more thing.

757
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,120
You have to wear this.

758
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:42,160
(tinkling)

759
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:44,110
So these are the 
 frozen yogurt 
 machines.

760
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:46,180
You just pull the lever 
 and when it comes out

761
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:47,780
You just put a little 
 swirly on top and 
 you're good to go, okay?

762
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:49,750
Swirly? 
 This is gonna be great.

763
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,590
And all your friends 
 will be here to 
 support you.

764
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:54,320
We all want you 
 to succeed at 
 your first job.

765
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:56,320
Thank you so much. 
 Uh-huh.

766
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:16,540
(both laugh nastily)

767
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:23,020
<i>Ed!</i>

768
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,450
<i>Ed: Here she is, folks,</i>

769
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,690
A future homecoming Princess 
 of lake Monroe, Louisiana.

770
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,730
Who is this natural 
 beauty, you ask?

771
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:33,690
<i>Will you go away?</i> 
 <i>I'm working.</i>

772
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,010
This is Carter Mason.

773
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,320
<i>Secret identity?</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>Bait girl.</i>

774
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,200
So confident of 
 her innate royalty,

775
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:43,570
She is completely 
 unafraid to handle

776
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,610
Whatever 
 disgusting creature...

777
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:46,820
Hey!

778
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:49,540
Isn't that... Not on 
 my camera, please.

779
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:50,680
<i>Then turn it off.</i>

780
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,080
No.

781
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:54,250
Today's my last day 
 to get the "before" 
 footage.

782
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,720
The Princess vote 
 is tomorrow.

783
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:57,750
Well, then go shoot 
 Chelsea or Brooke.

784
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,810
Nah. I've got tons 
 of them already.

785
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:01,840
They pay me 
 to film them.

786
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:03,010
Is that why 
 you're doing this?

787
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:04,210
'cause of the money?

788
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,740
Absolutely.

789
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:08,230
I'm the only senior 
 guy in lake Monroe 
 who doesn't have a car.

790
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,310
Figures.

791
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:14,100
You really hate 
 this whole Princess 
 thing, don't you?

792
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:17,490
I don't hate it exactly. 
 I just think it's shallow.

793
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,880
Girls like Chelsea 
 and Brooke, all they 
 care about is shoes.

794
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:24,260
Like wearing 
 the right clothes 
 makes them superior.

795
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:26,750
I just want to 
 do something more 
 important with my life,

796
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,150
Like my dad.

797
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:32,440
Yeah, yeah, he does 
 sell some sick bait.

798
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:34,270
Right.

799
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:37,140
So, speaking 
 of princesses, 
 where's Rosie?

800
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:39,210
How should I know?

801
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,400
(cell phone ringing)

802
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,520
I think I just found her.

803
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:51,360
Girl 1: Hey, I've been 
 waiting here for, like, 
 10 minutes.

804
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,240
Boy 1: I haven't 
 got all day!

805
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:56,110
Rosalinda: Just a second.

806
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,660
(people grumbling)

807
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:05,070
Hold on.

808
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:06,950
Oh, no!

809
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,500
Girl 2: 
 It's not brain science!

810
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,230
Boy 2: Come on, 
 what are they 
 paying you for?

811
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,770
Girl 2: I've been 
 waiting for, 
 like, ever!

812
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:26,010
Come on, chels. 
 She's dying in 
 there. Help her out.

813
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:29,510
You're absolutely right. 
 Brookie, we should 
 go in there.

814
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:32,210
Oh, chels. If only 
 our pedicures were dry.

815
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:38,450
Fine.

816
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:42,020
Bull, will you do me 
 a huge favor?

817
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:43,510
Yeah. Yeah.

818
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:49,510
(whispering)

819
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:52,570
(softly) 
 wait. How do I know 
 it's the right one?

820
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:55,490
It's big. It's red. 
 Can't miss it.

821
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,070
Boy 3: I can't believe it. 
 This is ridiculous!

822
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,210
Boy 4: I want 
 my yogurt, okay?

823
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:16,570
Girl 3: You need 
 some help, or what?

824
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,040
Boy 4: Hello?

825
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,650
Girl 3: I have to go!

826
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,020
(machinery powering up)

827
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,220
(gasping)

828
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:39,700
Oh, no!

829
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,580
(people squealing)

830
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:01,540
(screams)

831
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,920
(people laughing)

832
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:13,250
What are you doing?

833
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,620
Are you okay? 
 Come here, Rosie.

834
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:19,050
You said to get a job.

835
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,790
Not this one! 
 This job's for losers.

836
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,890
Trust me, I've had 
 this job. The bait 
 shop is a step up.

837
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,330
(people chattering)

838
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:28,250
Hey, check it out.

839
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,800
What is happening?

840
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:36,750
Carter: Chelsea set you up.

841
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:40,720
She invited all those people 
 to come watch you make 
 a fool of yourself.

842
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:42,610
Carter, it's okay.

843
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,600
I am not a fool.

844
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,920
And she cannot make 
 something out of me 
 that I am not.

845
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,540
Rosie, we have 
 to do something.

846
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,740
I will turn the other 
 cheek, because that 
 is what princesses do.

847
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:25,250
Your father, 
 the king of yogurts,

848
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,860
Would be very 
 disappointed in you.

849
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:37,930
(all gasping)

850
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:43,140
Yeah, well, 
 I'm not a Princess.

851
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,520
(exclaiming in disgust)

852
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:49,890
(all laughing)

853
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:53,450
She can't be a Princess!

854
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,520
Don't freak, 
 but she kind of can.

855
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,920
I've just been texted, 
 like, 10 times.

856
00:52:57,990 --> 00:52:59,940
Everybody thinks 
 she's pretty cool.

857
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,820
Tomorrow, 
 when the whole school 
 votes for three princesses,

858
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:05,040
She could be 
 one of them.

859
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:06,260
And if she gets 
 enough votes...

860
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:07,600
Don't say it.

861
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:08,760
...She could 
 become Queen.

862
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:11,530
No, I'm the Queen! 
 It's my Destiny!

863
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,320
(all murmuring)

864
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,190
That's kind 
 of iffy now.

865
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:18,920
I'd rather eat 
 carbs than see her 
 wearing my crown.

866
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:20,110
We have to stop her.

867
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,390
How?

868
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:26,930
If she never becomes 
 a Princess, she can't 
 be the Queen, right?

869
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:29,270
I'm not sure where 
 you're going here.

870
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:33,150
Grab your cell. 
 We've got a whole 
 lot of texting to do.

871
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,240
So, it's a skill that 
 most Americans master 
 in, like, the third grade,

872
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:39,780
But it's never 
 too late to learn.

873
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,280
I am ready to try.

874
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:42,680
Good luck.

875
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:47,450
(burps)

876
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,550
(laughs)

877
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,290
Nice.

878
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,420
Okay, next we'll 
 work on slouching,

879
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:55,130
Eye-rolling and 
 talking back 
 to my dad.

880
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,930
If Mr. Elegante 
 could see me right now, 
 he would be so mad at me.

881
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,100
Who's Mr. Elegante?

882
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,400
My royal dress designer.

883
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:03,970
You're kidding, 
 right?

884
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,270
No. He is a close 
 family friend.

885
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,570
If there were 
 ever an emergency,

886
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:10,510
He would be the first 
 I would call.

887
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,310
Must be nice 
 to be a Queen.

888
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:17,280
Actually, it's not 
 all about the dresses 
 and crowns, Carter.

889
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:20,570
My mother told me 
 that my father never 
 called himself king.

890
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,250
To our people, 
 he was father, 
 brother and friend.

891
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:30,190
I hope to be like him 
 when I am Queen 
 of Costa Luna.

892
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:31,750
Father, brother...

893
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,660
(laughing) no!

894
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:36,000
I want to make 
 a difference.

895
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:38,050
To do something 
 more important 
 with your life?

896
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,190
Yes.

897
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:46,460
You know, you're different 
 than I thought a Princess 
 would be.

898
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:49,000
I hope that is 
 a good thing.

899
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:51,320
Yeah, it is.

900
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:53,970
Thank you for 
 helping me today.

901
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,170
A Princess is never sure 
 who her true friend is.

902
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,790
Today, I am sure.

903
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:01,680
Me, too.

904
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:09,230
(burping loudly)

905
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:16,420
I'll give myself 
 this one and this one,

906
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:19,010
For bravery and honor.

907
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,980
A thief has no honor.

908
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:23,010
Sophia! Come in, 
 come in, come in.

909
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,850
We have a great 
 deal to discuss.

910
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,420
Do you think 
 it's too much?

911
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:31,840
I want to look my 
 best when I announce 
 my engagement today.

912
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:36,240
Who could be so 
 unfortunate as to 
 become your bride?

913
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:38,630
Well, as a matter 
 of fact,

914
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:43,900
She is standing 
 right here in 
 this room.

915
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,320
(laughing)

916
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:48,390
That's ridiculous. 
 I will never marry you. 
 Ever.

917
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:51,290
(laughing) 
 of course you won't.

918
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,680
But Rosalinda 
 will not know this.

919
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,250
She will see 
 the announcement,

920
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,080
Assume you are doing 
 it to protect her,

921
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:00,820
And come racing back 
 to her mother's side

922
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:03,400
Just in time to 
 join you in exile.

923
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:05,590
The people of Costa Luna 
 will never accept that.

924
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:08,910
The same was said for 
 the people of Costa 
 Estrella 20 years ago,

925
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:11,210
And look what happened.

926
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,360
Hmm.

927
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:14,350
Take her back 
 to her cell.

928
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:17,890
Oh, and bring me 
 my hair and 
 makeup team.

929
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:21,000
We must touch up this gray 
 before I go on camera.

930
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,070
Yeah.

931
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:25,190
(shouts in pain)

932
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,460
Sorry.

933
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,270
Carter: Wait, where's 
 everyone going?

934
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:35,240
<i>Burkle:</i> 
 <i>Good morning, students.</i>

935
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,570
<i>The votes for your</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>three homecoming...</i>

936
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,470
Rosalinda: 
 We must hurry, Carter.

937
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:39,770
Carter: Okay, you're 
 way too into this 
 Princess thing.

938
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,510
<i>Burkle: Now, I'd like to</i> 
 <i>announce the winners.</i>

939
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:46,680
<i>And your princesses</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>are Chelsea Barnes!</i>

940
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,370
(all cheering)

941
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,160
Thank you! Thank you!

942
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:57,790
<i>Carter Mason!</i>

943
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:59,740
(all cheering)

944
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:02,030
"Carter Mason."

945
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:08,370
<i>And your third and</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>final Princess is</i>

946
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:12,060
<i>Rosie Gonzalez!</i>

947
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,660
(all cheering)

948
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:23,720
Thank you. Thank you.

949
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:29,810
What happened?

950
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:31,070
I don't know!

951
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,940
We texted everyone 
 in the school.

952
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:35,210
They were supposed 
 to vote for Carter 
 instead of Rosie,

953
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,110
Not Carter and Rosie.

954
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:39,480
This is all your fault.

955
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,620
How is it my fault?

956
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:45,260
If you were more popular, 
 you'd be the Princess, 
 not her.

957
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:52,060
I am popular!

958
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:01,210
This is not good, okay? 
 Me being a Princess 
 is not normal.

959
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,570
Hey, there.

960
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,040
Hey, Rosie, 
 can I talk to you?

961
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:07,640
Me? 
 Her?

962
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,180
Yeah.

963
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,270
So, you know there's 
 the homecoming dance 
 and everything, and...

964
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,520
Will you go 
 to the dance 
 with me, Rosie?

965
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:16,690
Me? 
 Her?

966
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,290
Yeah. I want you to be 
 my date for the dance.

967
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:24,810
Donny, that is very 
 kind of you, but no.

968
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,150
Will you excuse me?

969
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:27,950
Uh...

970
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,150
Sure.

971
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:35,060
That was the most 
 humiliating thing that 
 has ever happened to me.

972
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:38,830
And I've been 
 humiliated a lot.

973
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,660
What was I thinking? 
 A guy like donny would 
 never go out with me.

974
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:46,400
Then he is not 
 worthy of you.

975
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:49,540
Yeah, you can say 
 that 'cause you're 
 all high and royal.

976
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,770
But I'm just 
 a girl who sells bait.

977
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,820
No.

978
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:57,730
You are so much more. 
 You are a Princess now.

979
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,730
Yeah. Trust me, 
 I am not a Princess.

980
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,720
Yes, you are.

981
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:05,190
You just do not 
 feel like one yet.

982
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:09,060
When I came here, 
 you taught me how to 
 act normal, not royal.

983
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:13,310
Now it is my turn 
 to teach you.

984
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:16,450
You think that 
 being a Princess 
 is superficial.

985
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:18,130
Yeah, I guess.

986
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:22,420
That it is about 
 what you wear, 
 and how you look.

987
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:25,240
Well, it is a little bit 
 about how you look.

988
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:27,170
But more importantly,

989
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,240
It is about what you 
 have to offer the world 
 and who you are inside.

990
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:38,500
Come on, Carter. 
 Let's go find 
 your inner Princess.

You're just so good 
 with everybody.

1020
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:21,740
Kids, old people, 
 you're probably 
 even good with dogs.

1021
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:23,540
That is true.

1022
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:26,160
You're so much 
 more generous than 
 I thought you'd be.

1023
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:28,830
It is a Princess's 
 job to help people.

1024
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:32,670
I guess I never 
 really thought about

1025
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,770
What it really means 
 to be a Princess.

1026
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,940
(both giggling)

1027
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,470
Like this.

1028
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:40,710
I can't believe 
 you actually have 
 to do this.

1029
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,440
Oh, no, you don't.

1030
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:44,580
Wait, then, 
 why am I doing it?

1031
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:46,180
(laughing) 
 because it is funny.

1032
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:48,280
What? I hate you!

1033
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:50,380
You do? 
 No, no, no. No.

1034
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:52,990
No, I didn't mean it that way. 
 I didn't mean "I hate you" 
 I hate you.

1035
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:56,170
I meant "I hate you," like, 
 you're my best friend.

1036
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,370
Oh!

1037
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,010
Well, then, 
 I hate you, too.

1038
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,990
And that dress is ugly.

1039
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:03,110
It is? 
 No!

1040
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,630
It is beautiful. 
 And so are you.

1041
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,350
Look.

1042
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:18,010
You're becoming 
 a Princess on 
 the inside.

1043
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,410
And now you look 
 like one, too.

1044
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:33,260
Excuse me, I have this 
 lame reading assignment 
 for Spanish class.

1045
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:35,530
Do you think that 
 you have something 
 that's really easy

1046
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,500
With lots of pictures?

1047
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,740
Oh! Cool.

1048
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:08,750
"Princess Rosalinda"? 
 No way!

1049
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,920
(cell phone ringing)

1050
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:24,930
It's Mason. What's going on?

1051
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,830
<i>Director: General Kane's</i> 
 <i>announcement of</i> 
 <i>his engagement</i>

1052
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,830
<i>To</i> dona <i>Sophia montoya</i>

1053
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:32,300
<i>Has popped up in several</i> 
 <i>tabloid magazines.</i>

1054
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:34,140
<i>The story is contained so far,</i>

1055
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:37,410
<i>But I would be lying to say</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>I was not concerned.</i>

1056
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:39,030
She'd never agree 
 to marry him.

1057
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:41,560
<i>I was not suggesting</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>she would, major.</i>

1058
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:44,030
General Kane's doing this 
 to draw Rosalinda out.

1059
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:46,880
He knows she won't 
 allow her mother to 
 be forced into marriage.

1060
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:48,650
<i>Absolutely.</i>

1061
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:52,090
<i>So, it is imperative</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>that we keep this</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>from Rosalinda.</i>

1062
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:53,940
Yes, ma'am. I agree.

1063
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:55,590
<i>Major, has she made</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>any enemies?</i>

1064
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:58,650
<i>Anyone who might want</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>to expose her identity?</i>

1065
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,130
Not that I know of.

1066
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:05,600
Let's move that 
 throne here.

1067
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:08,040
No. No, actually, 
 there.

1068
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:12,410
Oh, I know. 
 Up there.

1069
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,550
And let's hang some 
 lights directly on it.

1070
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:19,620
That might be too harsh 
 on my skin tone.

1071
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,590
We should hire 
 a lighting designer.

1072
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:25,290
The budget's gone, 
 Chelsea. What you 
 see is what you get.

1073
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:28,860
Okay, okay. I know!

1074
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:31,330
A follow-spot 
 just on me.

1075
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,230
Maybe light pink, 
 or golden like the sun.

1076
01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:37,130
It's great to be Queen.

1077
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,340
You're not Queen yet. 
 Carter could win,

1078
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,690
Or Rosie. 
 Can it, Muffy.

1079
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,210
My name's Margaret.

1080
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,640
Not anymore.

1081
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:49,450
Hey, chels.

1082
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:51,110
Don't call me that.

1083
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,450
You lost that right when 
 you lost your Princess 
 crown to bait girl

1084
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,700
And her strangely 
 formal cousin.

1085
01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:57,220
Well, what if we 
 could get Rosie

1086
01:04:57,290 --> 01:04:59,390
To drop out 
 of homecoming 
 altogether?

1087
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:00,540
She would never do that.

1088
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:02,460
She might.

1089
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:06,500
She's not who 
 she says she is. 
 She's <i>princesa</i> Rosalinda.

1090
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:10,950
Chelsea: It's in Spanish.

1091
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:13,140
What does the article say?

1092
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,140
I'm not sure.

1093
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:18,760
What? I'm pretty, 
 not smart. 
 Okay, let me try.

1094
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:24,450
It's about Rosie 
 and her mom.

1095
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,980
One of them has 
 fled the country and 
 one of them is in prison

1096
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:29,290
Or a paper bag.

1097
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:31,170
I get those 
 two mixed up.

1098
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,890
No biggie. 
 Good work, brookie.

1099
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,740
Thanks, chels.

1100
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:39,430
Chelsea: 
 I have the perfect plan.

1101
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:54,590
Joe: Hey, girls.

1102
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:57,050
Hi, Mr. Mason. 
 Is Rosie home?

1103
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,330
Maybe. What's up?

1104
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,870
Up?

1105
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:03,000
Well, we're planning 
 a little Princess 
 surprise for Carter.

1106
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:04,170
To congratulate her.

1107
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,190
Yeah. It was 
 Rosie's idea.

1108
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:09,560
She's in her room. 
 Go on in.

1109
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,850
(chuckles)

1110
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:27,010
(speaking Spanish)

1111
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,830
I've never heard 
 of Costa Luna. 
 Have you, brookie?

1112
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:31,920
No, chels.

1113
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,800
I do not know 
 what you are 
 talking about.

1114
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:37,320
We know all about 
 you and your mother. 
 And the paper bag.

1115
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:40,460
What? 
 Poor Princess Rosalinda.

1116
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,990
Did you hear 
 she's in hiding?

1117
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:44,560
You do not understand.

1118
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:46,580
I understand that 
 you lied to us.

1119
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:48,000
Only to protect 
 my mother.

1120
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:49,720
From the paper bag?

1121
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:51,170
No.

1122
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:54,250
Look, I will give 
 you a reward for 
 keeping my secret.

1123
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,540
We know you will.

1124
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:57,360
You do?

1125
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:00,010
And we already 
 have it picked out.

1126
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,080
I don't understand.

1127
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:02,600
Yeah, me either.

1128
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:06,330
You're gonna turn in 
 your crown, Princess.

1129
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:09,990
You're going to tell 
 everyone that there is, 
 and only will be,

1130
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:13,160
One true homecoming Queen, 
 and that's me.

1131
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:15,460
That's good. 
 Fine.

1132
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:18,410
You may take my crown,

1133
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,680
But you will not 
 take Carter's.

1134
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:22,430
She's no threat 
 to you, Chelsea.

1135
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,240
Fine.

1136
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:28,250
Let bait girl 
 play Princess 
 for one night.

1137
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:31,260
She just won't 
 look like one.

1138
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:45,660
(honks)

1139
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:49,240
(Chelsea laughing)

1140
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:51,160
Chelsea: 
 Have fun at the dance!

1141
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,500
(both laughing)

1142
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:02,510
(car horn honking)

1143
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,010
Look at what 
 Chelsea and Brooke...

1144
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:11,300
What's wrong?

1145
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:12,420
I have to leave, Carter.

1146
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,330
Leave? Leave where?

1147
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:16,340
Back to my country.

1148
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:25,580
(sighs)

1149
01:08:25,650 --> 01:08:28,970
General Kane is 
 forcing my mother 
 into marriage.

1150
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:30,800
Father's never gonna 
 let you go back.

1151
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:32,800
He'll never know.

1152
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:34,540
Yeah, but I know. 
 And I'm not gonna 
 let you go back, either.

1153
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,510
Carter, you have to 
 stay out of this.

1154
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:38,090
I have a duty 
 to my people.

1155
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:41,530
And this is something 
 that you'll never 
 understand.

1156
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:46,280
I've loved living 
 here in Louisiana.

1157
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:49,550
And I wish my life 
 could be like this 
 every day.

1158
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:53,120
But this is not reality.

1159
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:58,210
I mean, you think 
 my life as a Princess 
 is some fairy tale?

1160
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:03,100
This here is a fairy tale!

1161
01:09:04,330 --> 01:09:07,340
And I cannot 
 hide here anymore.

1162
01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:10,110
Soon I will be 
 Queen of Costa Luna.

1163
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:14,690
My country needs me.

1164
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:19,820
You're right. 
 They do need you.

1165
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:23,020
They need you 
 to lead them, 
 and to protect them.

1166
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:26,190
And that's something 
 you can't do from jail,

1167
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:30,310
Which is exactly where 
 you'll end up if you 
 go back to Costa Luna.

1168
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:41,300
No way am I 
 letting this happen.

1169
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:50,610
(cell phone ringing)

1170
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:56,640
<i>Hola,</i> this is elegante. 
 Who is this?

1171
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:57,800
That's not important.

1172
01:09:57,870 --> 01:10:00,260
All that matters 
 is I'm a friend of 
 Princess Rosalinda,

1173
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,330
<i>And she's about to make</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>a very big mistake.</i>

1174
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:05,860
My <i>princesa?</i> 
 <i> What mistake is this?</i>

1175
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:08,100
<i>Carter:</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>She wants to come home.</i>

1176
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:10,370
No, no, no, no, no, 
 she must not.

1177
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:11,470
(speaking Spanish)

1178
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:13,350
It's too dangerous.

1179
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:16,560
I know. 
 But I have a plan.

1180
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:19,530
And I'm gonna need you 
 to listen very carefully.

1181
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:23,500
I will do anything 
 for the <i>princesa.</i> 
 <i> Anything.</i>

1182
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:26,880
Okay, to start with, 
 I'm gonna need two 
 dresses.

1183
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:38,240
You okay?

1184
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:40,510
I'm going to miss 
 this place.

1185
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:43,580
I'm going to miss you, 
 Carter.

1186
01:10:43,650 --> 01:10:44,900
I can't believe 
 I'm saying this,

1187
01:10:44,970 --> 01:10:47,640
But I'm going to 
 miss you, too.

1188
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:55,110
Rosie, can you 
 do me a big favor 
 before you go?

1189
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:56,960
Anything.

1190
01:10:57,030 --> 01:11:00,070
You said it is 
 a Princess' job 
 to help others.

1191
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:01,990
It is.

1192
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,040
Well, the dance 
 is on Friday night,

1193
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:07,310
And there's some people 
 that I want to help.

1194
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:11,550
I want to make this night 
 special for them, 
 for all of us.

1195
01:11:11,610 --> 01:11:14,100
Will you please 
 stay until then?

1196
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16,500
For them, please.

1197
01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:19,270
(inaudible)

1198
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,310
Margaret: That's it, 
 keep your chin up.

1199
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:46,800
Joe: What in the...

1200
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:50,380
Margaret: Okay, stay there, 
 that's perfect. Very good.

1201
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:53,770
Morning, dad. 
 Morning. What the...

1202
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,710
What are you 
 girls up to?

1203
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:57,410
Just having some friends 
 over from school. 
 Is that okay?

1204
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,580
Yeah, yeah. It's fine. 
 What's in the box?

1205
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,780
Homecoming stuff. 
 No biggie.

1206
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:11,550
Hmm.

1207
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:15,630
Kane: And you are sure about 
 this homecoming dance, 
 <i>senor</i> elegante?

1208
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:17,530
Absolutely.

1209
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,960
I feel, in one way, 
 I'm betraying my Queen,

1210
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:23,630
But I thought 
 you should know, 
 general.

1211
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:27,340
It's for the good 
 of Costa Luna.

1212
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,940
You did the right thing 
 by coming to me, <i>senor.</i>

1213
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:32,910
Fuel the jet!

1214
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:35,610
Tell the pilot 
 we will be flying 
 to Louisiana.

1215
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:37,250
(speaking Spanish)

1216
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:38,920
(laughing)

1217
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:45,390
A lovely color. 
 Lovely indeed.

1218
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:47,240
Caribbean blue, general.

1219
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:50,860
To complement 
 Princess Rosalinda's 
 skin tone.

1220
01:12:52,130 --> 01:12:55,450
Well, back to work. 
 You have a dress 
 to finish.

1221
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,470
Two, actually.

1222
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:12,300
Where did you get them?

1223
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:15,140
Well, you said 
 to call Mr. Elegante 
 if I had an emergency.

1224
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,140
And I think 
 that this is 
 a fashion emergency.

1225
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,440
Carter, you are brilliant.

1226
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:21,670
This one is yours.

1227
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:24,310
He says you look 
 best in pink.

1228
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:27,580
And this one is mine. 
 It's caribbean blue.

1229
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:29,520
(Rosalinda chuckles)

1230
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:33,390
Thank you, Carter. 
 This is a night 
 I'll always remember.

1231
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:37,940
I hope so.

1232
01:13:39,490 --> 01:13:41,910
Are you guys ready? 
 'cause it's getting 
 kind of late.

1233
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:43,460
Helen: Come on in, girls.

1234
01:13:43,530 --> 01:13:46,680
Helen's house of beauty 
 is open for business.

1235
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
(all chattering)

1236
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:55,240
Okay.

1237
01:13:56,710 --> 01:13:59,010
Oh, this is a great 
 color on you.

1238
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:15,360
How do I look, dad?

1239
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:17,500
I think we have 
 a problem.

1240
01:14:18,770 --> 01:14:21,400
I may have to stop 
 calling you "pal."

1241
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:24,670
(cell phone ringing)

1242
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:29,780
All right, I gotta 
 grab this. You girls 
 gonna be okay?

1243
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,840
Yeah, we'll be fine. 
 Go ahead.

1244
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:32,210
You sure?

1245
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:33,850
Of course. 
 We're not kids.

1246
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:36,220
All right. Well, 
 have a good time. 
 And be careful.

1247
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:39,070
Helen: Mason. 
 Helen.

1248
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:41,220
All right, 
 your highnesses.

1249
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:44,490
Time's a-wasting. 
 The dance starts 
 in 10 minutes.

1250
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:37,290
Masks? No one said 
 anything about masks.

1251
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:40,330
(grunts)

1252
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,800
Come on!

1253
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:46,200
(car lock chirps)

1254
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:50,560
Hey! Hey!

1255
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:53,840
I'm stuck! 
 Open the door, 
 donny. Hello?

1256
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,510
Donny. Donny!

1257
01:15:56,580 --> 01:15:57,700
(car lock chirps)

1258
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,180
(screams)

1259
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:02,250
(whimpering)

1260
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:04,740
(Chelsea sputtering)

1261
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:08,060
Ed: Come here, 
 come here.

1262
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,660
(whimpering)

1263
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:13,260
You okay? 
 (exclaims) get off!

1264
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,430
(grunts)

1265
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,900
<i>(hip-hop music playing)</i>

1266
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:43,630
Okay, freshman, 
 I think I can 
 take it from here.

1267
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:54,570
No.

1268
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,170
Carter, 
 what's the problem?

1269
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:59,160
I thought we had, 
 you know, something.

1270
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:00,410
Actually, we don't.

1271
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,200
Okay, what's up?

1272
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:05,230
Isn't this what you've 
 been waiting for since, 
 like, third grade?

1273
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:10,440
Before I put on this dress, 
 you couldn't even 
 remember my name.

1274
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:14,610
I might be a Princess 
 tonight, but I'll 
 always be bait girl.

1275
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:16,660
And I'm proud of that.

1276
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:20,930
Carter, you're making 
 a big mistake.

1277
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:25,150
No, donny. 
 I don't think I am.

1278
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:31,410
(sighs contentedly)

1279
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,210
You deserve better 
 than him, Carter.

1280
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:36,450
I know. 
 Too bad it took this 
 long to realize it.

1281
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:38,650
Guys!

1282
01:17:46,590 --> 01:17:48,360
(grunting)

1283
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:51,340
What happened to you?

1284
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:53,180
Shut up and fix me.

1285
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:55,100
Did you get me a crown? 
 Who cares?

1286
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:57,000
In a few minutes, 
 it won't matter anyways.

1287
01:17:57,070 --> 01:18:00,640
I'll be named Queen 
 and this will 
 all be over.

1288
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:02,990
I thought we were 
 in this together.

1289
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:06,090
We are. Lip gloss.

1290
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,030
No.

1291
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:09,160
What? 
 I said no.

1292
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:10,730
You can't use my 
 lip gloss anymore.

1293
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,620
But I have to look pretty. 
 I'm a Princess.

1294
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:15,370
Yeah, a terrible one.

1295
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,420
A Princess is supposed 
 to be a girl of 
 exemplary character,

1296
01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:20,440
A role model. But you,

1297
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:24,890
You're not even kind, 
 honest or charitable 
 in any way.

1298
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,960
You're not even nice.

1299
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:29,970
I don't think 
 I want to be your 
 friend anymore.

1300
01:18:30,030 --> 01:18:31,400
Brookie...

1301
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:32,850
Don't call me that.

1302
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:42,460
Carter, Rosie, 
 I just wanted to 
 thank you for tonight.

1303
01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:44,730
I never thought I 
 could look beautiful.

1304
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,600
Or feel beautiful, 
 for that matter.

1305
01:18:47,670 --> 01:18:49,400
Margaret, 
 you are beautiful.

1306
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:50,900
(speaking Spanish)

1307
01:18:50,970 --> 01:18:54,210
And thanks for not 
 calling me Muffy.

1308
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:55,840
No problem.

1309
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:57,140
<i>(hip-hop song playing)</i>

1310
01:18:57,210 --> 01:18:59,780
I love this song! 
 Let's go dance!

1311
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:01,880
Well, why don't 
 you two go ahead? 
 Be princesses.

1312
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:03,250
Okay!

1313
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:11,920
There you are! 
 Finally!

1314
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:13,360
You don't understand, 
 miss.

1315
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:17,060
I'm the... 
 Security. I know. 
 You're late.

1316
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:20,250
And what is with 
 the uniforms?

1317
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,620
No one's wearing 
 berets this year.

1318
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:25,810
Just stay out here 
 and make sure no one 
 gets in that dance,

1319
01:19:25,870 --> 01:19:29,090
Unless they're students 
 from lake Monroe. Got it?

1320
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:34,600
Got it. 
 Enjoy your evening.

1321
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:49,800
Okay, everybody, 
 he's about to announce 
 the winner.

1322
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:52,730
Let's put on our masks.

1323
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,750
(exclaims in exasperation)

1324
01:20:06,810 --> 01:20:08,800
Kane: Princesses everywhere.

1325
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:12,350
(sighs)

1326
01:20:13,690 --> 01:20:17,920
Caribbean blue. 
 Beautiful indeed.

1327
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:25,560
Come with me now, 
 <i>princesa,</i> and no harm 
 will come to your friends.

1328
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,860
<i>Can I have</i> 
 <i>your attention, please?</i> 
 <i>I hold here in my hand</i>

1329
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:39,860
<i>The name of our 2008</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>lake Monroe homecoming Queen.</i>

01:20:41,530 --> 01:20:43,270
<i>And the winner is</i>

1331
01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:47,590
<i>Princess Rosie Gonzalez.</i>

1332
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:49,150

1333
01:20:50,170 --> 01:20:52,170
<i>Rosie, are you out there?</i>

1334
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:53,680

1337
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:22,340
<i>Since I've been here,</i>

 <i> </i> <i>wonderful things.</i>

1338
01:21:22,490 --> 01:21:24,160
<i>Most importantly,</i>

1339
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:32,670
<i>I've learned about friendship</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>and loyalty and trust.</i>

1340
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:36,070
<i>And that those are not</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>things that are just given,</i>

1341
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,240
<i>But things we must earn.</i>

1342

<i>So I want to thank</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>Carter Mason</i>

1343
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:47,300
<i>For teaching me these things.</i>

1344
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:51,520
<i>And for being my friend.</i>

1345

<i>(music playing)</i>

01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,310
That was so beautiful, 
 Rosie.

1348
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:20,080
Thank you. But I 
 need to find Carter.

1349
01:22:30,790 --> 01:22:33,530
Hold it right there, 
 Princess.

1350
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:35,950
My crown. 
 Hand it over.

1351
01:22:36,010 --> 01:22:37,330
Chelsea, please...

1352
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:38,400
You're not going 
 anywhere

1353
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:40,400
Until I get 
 that crown.

1354
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,240
No!

1355
01:22:47,410 --> 01:22:48,260
(screams)

1356
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:49,460
Sorry.

1357
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:52,110
I am so getting 
 you back for this!

1358
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:57,850
Rosalinda: General Kane!

1359
01:23:02,690 --> 01:23:07,510
Well, it appears as 
 if everyone wants 
 to be a Princess.

1360
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:11,510
Unfortunately, 
 it is time for the 
 masquerade to end.

1361
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:14,980
What are you doing? 
 The plan was working 
 perfectly.

1362
01:23:15,050 --> 01:23:17,190
This was a very brave plan.

1363
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:20,540
But this is my fight, 
 not yours.

1364
01:23:20,610 --> 01:23:21,670
You don't have 
 to go with them.

1365
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:23,710
Enough!

1366
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:26,750
As the <i>princesa</i> 
 <i> so eloquently</i> 
 <i> pointed out,</i>

1367
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:29,620
This is not your fight.

1368
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,660
General Kane.

1369
01:23:45,730 --> 01:23:46,700
Good to see you again.

1370
01:23:46,770 --> 01:23:48,300
Kane: What is the 
 meaning of this?

1371
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:49,800
You are interfering 
 with official business

1372
01:23:49,870 --> 01:23:51,620
Of the sovereign 
 land of Costa Luna.

1373
01:23:51,670 --> 01:23:52,800
Maybe this will 
 fly in your country,

1374
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:55,110
But, here, 
 it's called kidnapping.

1375
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:58,810
We're turning you over 
 to the international 
 authorities.

1376
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:00,680
Get him.

1377
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:02,150
No, let me.

1378
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:03,550
I'm going to enjoy this.

1379
01:24:15,210 --> 01:24:16,280
(chuckles)

1380
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:20,020
How does it feel to 
 be brought to Justice

1381
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:21,980
By a 16-year-old girl, 
 general?

1382
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:23,620
Not so hot.

1383
01:24:27,370 --> 01:24:28,920
(sobbing)

1384
01:24:30,290 --> 01:24:33,000
I can't believe you 
 would do this for me.

1385
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:36,720
That's what princesses do.

1386
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:38,620
They do it for each other.

1387
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:41,870
And you are truly 
 a Princess now, 
 Carter Mason.

1388
01:24:43,170 --> 01:24:45,370
You rightfully 
 deserve this.

1389
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:55,000
Hold it! Nobody moves!

1390
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:57,040
Nobody goes anywhere.

1391
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,760
I'll take that.

1392
01:25:05,330 --> 01:25:07,680
Let her go. 
 She needs it way 
 more than I do.

1393
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:08,980
All right. Come on. 
 Hey, guard.

1394
01:25:09,050 --> 01:25:10,220
(grumbling)

1395
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:14,020
You got him?

1396
01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:17,010
Oh, I'm in so 
 much trouble.

1397
01:25:20,230 --> 01:25:21,560
(sighs)

1398
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,000
What were you thinking, 
 Carter?

1399
01:25:26,070 --> 01:25:28,680
I was thinking 
 I'd be perfect bait.

1400
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:31,070
Get it? I'm bait girl.

1401
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:32,240
Why didn't you 
 just come to me?

1402
01:25:32,310 --> 01:25:34,870
Dad, you would have 
 never let me do it.

1403
01:25:36,290 --> 01:25:37,980
You're lucky I was here.

1404
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:40,500
I knew you would be.

1405
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:43,580
You're always 
 there for me.

1406
01:25:43,650 --> 01:25:46,800
You rescue princesses. 
 That's what you do.

1407
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:50,860
You and me, pal.

1408
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:53,940
You and me, dad.

1409
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:08,240
Archbishop: I present to you

1410
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:13,560
Queen Rosalinda Marie 
 Montoya Fiore

1411
01:26:13,630 --> 01:26:15,500
Of Costa Luna!

1412
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:33,870
Long live Queen Rosie!

1413
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:40,520
Long live Queen Rosie!

1414
01:26:40,590 --> 01:26:43,660
(shouting in Spanish)

1415
01:26:43,730 --> 01:26:46,460
(all shouting in Spanish)

1416
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:52,120
<i>(two worlds collide</i> playing)

1417
01:26:52,190 --> 01:26:56,090
<i>¶ you had your dreams,</i> 
 <i> </i> <i>I had mine</i>

1418
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:59,890

1422
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:26,650
Ladies, you're here. 
 Excellent.

1423
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,290
Are you ready 
 for your next 
 assignment?

1424
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:29,720
I am. 
 Me, too.

1425
01:27:29,790 --> 01:27:31,360
But can we go somewhere 
 a little bit warmer?

1426
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:33,890
My feet are still 
 frozen from that 
 walk through Helsinki.

1427
01:27:38,030 --> 01:27:41,030
Carter, you can be 
 such a Princess.

1428
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:42,200
Something wrong 
 with that?

1429
01:27:42,270 --> 01:27:43,850
