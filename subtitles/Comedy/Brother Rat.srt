Hi. I'm checking out. 14322.

38
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:16,749
- Mr. Schaffer?
- That's me.

39
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:20,842
- I have your bill right here.
- Great. Thank you.

40
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:25,259
- How was your luck last night?
- I don't... I didn't gamble.

41
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:29,108
I was here for a friend's bachelor
party. I guess he's the gambler.

42
00:03:32,447 --> 00:03:34,955
Excuse me. What's this $110?

43
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,282
- Those are your in-room movies.
- No, I didn't watch any movies.

44
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:43,090
Okay, let's see. Afro Whores.

45
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,601
Afro Whores?

46
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:48,775
You watched it...
let's see... 11 times.

47
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:50,507
No. No, no, no, wait.

48
00:03:50,548 --> 00:03:55,858
Afro Whores, 2:30. Afro Whores,
4:00. Afro Whores, 5:30.

49
00:03:55,874 --> 00:03:58,366
It says in the morning you watched
The Grinch for ten minutes...

50
00:03:58,413 --> 00:04:00,434
and then switched back
over to Afro Whores.

51
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,378
I swear I didn't watch it. Okay.
I was at a bachelor party.

52
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:05,581
There were 35 people there.
You can ask any of them.

53
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:09,166
- You have to take that off my record.
- This is not a record, sir.

54
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:13,565
- It's a delete.
- Okay, fine. How many times did you watch it?

55
00:04:13,604 --> 00:04:15,600
None! I didn't watch it.

56
00:04:15,665 --> 00:04:19,495
Are you sure? "Sizzling,
three-way, back-door action...

57
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:21,838
"featuring two sexy soul sisters..."

58
00:04:21,906 --> 00:04:24,589
No, I don't need to know what
it's about. I did not watch it.

59
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:29,196
I didn't.

60
00:04:29,265 --> 00:04:33,607
<i>Drove 500, and Chipper Jones struck
out as we saw in that key situation.</i>

61
00:04:33,713 --> 00:04:37,487
<i>He's 0 for 5,
lost three straight games.</i>

62
00:04:37,552 --> 00:04:40,798
<i>This month he has
a one-game winning streak.</i>

63
00:04:44,144 --> 00:04:48,901
Miss? Miss, can I have
another one of these, please?

64
00:04:48,976 --> 00:04:52,750
Oh, sorry.
I thought you were a woman.

65
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:54,954
I am a woman.

66
00:04:57,508 --> 00:04:59,745
You know, you look
kind of familiar.

67
00:04:59,746 --> 00:05:01,984
Yeah, you do.

68
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,420
You know, I get that
all the time.

69
00:05:04,527 --> 00:05:06,828
I guess I just have
one of those faces.

70
00:05:06,894 --> 00:05:10,342
<i>And now for our loser of the week.
This week it's a no-brainer.</i>

71
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:13,261
<i>Referee Owen Templeton made
the biggest bonehead call...</i>

72
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:14,808
<i>in the history of football.</i>

73
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,644
<i>I think everyone remembers. It happened last
Sunday at Dallas with the score tied at 10.</i>

74
00:05:18,683 --> 00:05:21,246
<i>They were headed towards overtime.
Everything was cool.</i>

75
00:05:21,294 --> 00:05:23,301
<i>They were about to toss the coin
to see who would kick off.</i>

76
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:26,789
<i>- Dallas, call it in the air.
- Tails.</i>

77
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:29,349
<i>- That's heads.
- That was tails.</i>

78
00:05:29,422 --> 00:05:31,462
<i>- No. It's...
- That was tails.</i>

79
00:05:31,534 --> 00:05:34,730
<i>No... Wait! Hang on!
It's... Now, what did I say?</i>

80
00:05:34,797 --> 00:05:36,684
<i>- Tails!
- It's tails.</i>

81
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,597
<i>- It's heads.
- What are you doin'?</i>

82
00:05:41,581 --> 00:05:44,264
<i>You saw...</i>

83
00:05:44,847 --> 00:05:46,983
Okay, little brother,
just be cool.

84
00:05:47,053 --> 00:05:48,908
Just be cool.

85
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,192
Okay, this is it.
See that glass?

86
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:08,674
Walk across the lobby, slip on
the glass, let gravity do the rest.

87
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:11,769
I might eak my neck.

88
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:15,823
It's true. You could break your neck.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.

89
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:18,542
Why don't oo do it?

90
00:06:18,543 --> 00:06:21,445
Because, Einstein, one of us
needs to be the victim...

91
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:24,103
and one of us needs
to be the witness.

92
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:25,537
What kind of witness would you make?

93
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:27,841
I'm your own brother. I don't
know what the hell you're sayin'.

94
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,919
How's your tongue?
Let me see it.

95
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:34,547
How's it look?

96
00:06:35,925 --> 00:06:39,886
It looks good.
It looks much better.

97
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,071
Okay, here we go.

98
00:06:42,122 --> 00:06:46,312
Remember, we're on Candid Camera,
so make it look good.

99
00:06:57,096 --> 00:06:59,463
Excuse me. I'm a lawyer.
Gloria Allred.

100
00:06:59,528 --> 00:07:02,146
- What the hell happened here?
- She slipped on that glass.

101
00:07:02,216 --> 00:07:06,373
Those arrogant jerks. They're gonna pay for
this. They're gonna pay through the nose.

102
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,025
How's your neck?
I've never seen such negligence.

103
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,951
This is going to be huge.

104
00:07:11,922 --> 00:07:12,838
She's an angel.

105
00:07:12,936 --> 00:07:16,117
What a cute little face.
Would you look at those cheeks?

106
00:07:16,164 --> 00:07:18,978
- She's absolutely beautiful.
- She has your eyes.

107
00:07:19,048 --> 00:07:21,120
It's the only picture
I have of her.

108
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,046
It's all worn out 'cause
I'm always looking at it.

109
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:26,787
- You haven't seen her for 27 years?
- Not till today.

110
00:07:26,855 --> 00:07:29,789
- She just called you out of the blue?
- No, no, I found her.

111
00:07:29,863 --> 00:07:34,369
I hired a detective. I spent all
my money and now we're going to meet.

112
00:07:34,438 --> 00:07:37,308
- You think she'll recognize me?
- Of course she will, won't she?

113
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:39,237
- Yeah.
- She will.

114
00:08:00,107 --> 00:08:01,220
Vera Baker.

115
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,279
My baby...

116
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,758
Excuse me. I have to take this.

117
00:08:12,397 --> 00:08:13,826
This is Merrill.

118
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,434
No! That's unacceptable!

119
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,946
Listen, tell Warren if we don't ship by Tuesday,
we won't be in the stores by Mother's Day.

120
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:24,067
And that's unacceptable, so don't
give me any excuses, and do it!

121
00:08:24,413 --> 00:08:27,096
Do it!
Just shut up and get it done!

122
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,675
Oh, honey, you broke your phone.

123
00:08:33,184 --> 00:08:37,112
It's okay. I carry extras.

124
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,138
- Why don't we sit down?
- Yes.

125
00:08:49,794 --> 00:08:52,991
You probably have
a thousand questions for me.

126
00:08:53,716 --> 00:08:54,294
No.

127
00:08:54,338 --> 00:08:57,818
I was young. I didn't tell
anybody I was pregnant.

128
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:01,369
And I felt I could handle it
at the time.

129
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:04,125
Hi. Do you think
you gals could just...

130
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:06,823
pull yourselves together
and bring us a drink?

131
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:08,151
- Yeah.
- Sure.

132
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:10,135
Sure, but what would you like?

133
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:12,380
Mimosa.

134
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:16,223
They both want a mimosa.

135
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:19,834
So, you sell cosmetics?

136
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:23,092
Yeah. I have my own company.

137
00:09:23,123 --> 00:09:25,309
And we're going public.

138
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:29,375
And you're not married?

139
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:32,671
- Lucianne said you wouldn't.
- Who?

140
00:09:32,736 --> 00:09:35,834
Lucianne, she's my psychic. She's the one
who told me to come look for you.

141
00:09:35,903 --> 00:09:37,791
She said you needed me.

142
00:09:37,855 --> 00:09:41,368
- She did?
- She said you were lonely...

143
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:45,846
and that you were worried about money
and that you had trouble sleeping.

144
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,790
Who the hell isn't?

145
00:09:58,686 --> 00:10:00,573
See? I told you
we didn't need a bellman.

146
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:04,183
Yeah, well, congratulations, Randy.
You avoided another tip.

147
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:06,229
Those nickels and dimes
add up, my dear.

148
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:08,276
- I call this bed!
- Hey, no fair.

149
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,521
- You got to pick last night.
- Go to hell, Jason.

150
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:12,444
- Make me.
- Hey, language, please.

151
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:14,581
- Bev, his and her bathrobes.
- Yes.

152
00:10:14,653 --> 00:10:16,540
- Look at that view.
- Yeah.

153
00:10:16,605 --> 00:10:20,957
- Nice view.
- Okay, honey. Why don't you unpack?

154
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,886
- Okay.
- And I'm just gonna go look around.

155
00:10:24,028 --> 00:10:28,357
Wait, wait, wait.
You're not going to the casino?

156
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,970
No, no, of course not.

157
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:34,681
You know, I just drove from the Grand
Canyon. Gotta stretch my legs.

158
00:10:34,748 --> 00:10:38,130
You swore to me on your mother's eyes
we are here to see David Copperfield.

159
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,723
- No gambling.
- No gambling, I'm just lookin' around.

160
00:10:42,748 --> 00:10:46,009
In fact, I'm gonna go
to the gift shop.

161
00:10:46,075 --> 00:10:48,050
I can jump farther than you.

162
00:10:48,124 --> 00:10:50,491
- I can jump farther.
- No way. Watch.

163
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,467
That's gotta hurt.
Honey, kids need ya.

164
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,807
- Hey, Nick. Nicky!
- Hey.

165
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,079
- You're not leaving?
- I'm in court on Tuesday.

166
00:11:01,147 --> 00:11:04,442
- No, you're not.
- I work for people who're in court on Tuesday.

167
00:11:04,506 --> 00:11:07,189
You pussy. You can't leave.
It's still goin' on up there.

168
00:11:07,258 --> 00:11:09,328
Richie, I have to, okay.
I've had two hours sleep.

169
00:11:09,398 --> 00:11:12,376
Steve Cunningham just got another stripper,
Nicky. I'm tellin', you got to see this one.

170
00:11:12,442 --> 00:11:14,296
- She's incredible.
- No, I can't. I got to get back.

171
00:11:14,362 --> 00:11:18,221
No, you don't, Nick.
I know you, man. You're scared.

172
00:11:18,283 --> 00:11:20,345
You are. You're scared it's gonna
get out of control up there.

173
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,711
Someday you'll be up for attorney
general and it'll come back to haunt you.

174
00:11:22,778 --> 00:11:26,035
- I'm not having this conversation.
- You didn't even gamble, man.

175
00:11:26,107 --> 00:11:28,278
Not one quarter.
That's no way to live, buddy.

176
00:11:28,316 --> 00:11:31,218
In fact, that ain't even livin'.
It's hiding.

177
00:11:31,262 --> 00:11:33,464
- I'm not hiding from anything.
- Oh, no?

178
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,119
- No.
- Okay, then prove it, Nick.

179
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:38,868
Do something, anything.
Break one rule.

180
00:11:38,937 --> 00:11:44,077
Here. Look. Nick, a paper.
Come on. Take it.

181
00:11:44,134 --> 00:11:47,647
Take it. Come on, Nick. Take it.

182
00:11:51,256 --> 00:11:53,361
I have a plane to catch, okay?

183
00:11:53,432 --> 00:11:55,919
I'll see you in Chicago.

184
00:11:57,496 --> 00:11:59,768
Oh, look, I won! I won!

185
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:02,062
Look at the little money comin' down.

186
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:05,200
Look. Look, look, look.
What's... What's...

187
00:12:05,271 --> 00:12:09,199
"You're a winner.
See guest services."

188
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:13,425
What? A dollar?

189
00:12:17,495 --> 00:12:19,349
Come on, baby. Come on!

190
00:12:35,575 --> 00:12:36,468
Come on.

191
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,768
We won!

192
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:45,903
- We won one.
- What is this? This isn't money.

193
00:13:03,476 --> 00:13:05,581
That's the prize? A free buffet?

194
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,658
Well no, actually, it's not a buffet.

195
00:13:07,756 --> 00:13:12,087
It's a special reception at 10:00
in the penthouse conference room.

196
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,556
"Where a spectacular, once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity awaits you."

197
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,802
And that's all I know.

198
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:21,517
- What do you think?
- I think it's some kind of scam.

199
00:13:21,586 --> 00:13:24,041
Good! A scam! We'll do it.

200
00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:26,962
- All right, great. I'll need to see some I.D. then.
- Okay.

201
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:41,577
There. I gambled.

202
00:13:47,811 --> 00:13:51,421
Family vacation? These are the moments
you got to savour, am I right?

203
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:53,968
- They'll never come around again.
- Exactly.

204
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,808
Excuse me.
Do you know what's going on?

205
00:13:56,881 --> 00:13:58,736
Free grub.
That's what's going on.

206
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:01,168
This room is fabulous.

207
00:14:01,232 --> 00:14:04,396
- Excuse me, does anybody know why we're here?
- Beats me.

208
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:07,311
Oh, my God.

209
00:14:07,376 --> 00:14:09,318
You should sue somebody.

210
00:14:09,424 --> 00:14:10,852
I did it myself.

211
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,944
- What?
- He said he did it himself.

212
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,850
Said he did it from a kit.

213
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:19,280
I knew I recognized you.
You're the referee... the bonehead.

214
00:14:19,952 --> 00:14:22,887
That's just the media
blowing it out of proportion.

215
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,050
My hairdresser's husband
lost $800 because of you.

216
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:29,540
- Everybody thinks we flip quarters.
- Can I have a picture with you?

217
00:14:29,615 --> 00:14:31,590
It's really
a commemorative coin. Look.

218
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,517
- Smile.
- Please. You...

219
00:14:35,502 --> 00:14:39,628
Am I too late?
Look. I won a coin.

220
00:14:39,691 --> 00:14:44,937
A gold coin.
Isn't this wonderful?

221
00:14:45,006 --> 00:14:47,111
Look at this room.

222
00:14:47,182 --> 00:14:52,502
What a beautiful room.
Have you seen this room?

223
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:55,442
Yes! We're in it.

224
00:14:57,741 --> 00:15:00,130
I am Enrico Pollini.

225
00:15:00,205 --> 00:15:04,328
Now, I know what you are thinking.
Enrico is a girl's name.

226
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:07,047
- No, I wasn't.
- No pun intended.

227
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:11,655
- What pun is that?
- Food. Look at all this food.

228
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:17,353
What a beautiful party.
Little cockdoggies.

229
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:19,012
They're called cocktail wienies.

230
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:23,754
Wienies. I'm so sorry.
My English is not so good.

231
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,470
But I'm learning.

232
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:28,906
That's it. Vera. Come on.
We're outta here.

233
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:31,752
- I want to say good-bye. Bye, y'all.
- Excuse me.

234
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:35,944
Thank you all for coming. I'm
Donald Sinclair. I own this hotel.

235
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,083
We don't have much time.

236
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:43,588
There's a meteor the size of North
Carolina heading straight for Earth.

237
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:48,741
The impact is going to kill every
thing and everyone on this planet.

238
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:53,247
I built a bunker in the basement of this casino
strong enough to withstand the blast.

239
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:56,448
There's room for eight people. I have
chosen the seven of you, plus me.

240
00:15:56,522 --> 00:16:01,988
When this is over, it'll be up to us to
repopulate and re-civilize the planet.

241
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:14,756
I couldn't resist! I'm sorry.

242
00:16:18,152 --> 00:16:20,672
A joke. He made a joke.

243
00:16:20,776 --> 00:16:24,966
Do sit down, please. Merrill, you
and your mother can sit over here.

244
00:16:25,032 --> 00:16:28,545
- How do you know she's my mother?
- Alas, there are no secrets anymore, Merrill.

245
00:16:28,616 --> 00:16:32,707
Actually, that's not quite true.
There is one secret, one last secret.

246
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:37,085
It involves all of you.

247
00:16:38,504 --> 00:16:41,820
- I'm getting goose pimples.
- Hey...

248
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,546
Ah, Mr. Schaffer!

249
00:16:44,615 --> 00:16:48,512
Curiosity got the better
of you, eh? Come and sit down.

250
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:52,004
- I'm fine. Thanks.
- You haven't missed anything.

251
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,958
We were just
cutting to the chase.

252
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:56,673
Cutting to the chase.

253
00:17:00,504 --> 00:17:01,844
Well, you'll laugh later.

254
00:17:01,845 --> 00:17:05,633
Now, as you know, the odds against
winning a jackpot downstairs...

255
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:08,865
or hitting the state lottery are
astronomical... I mean, millions to one.

256
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:12,479
A serious person doesn't
even bother, but today...

257
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,811
you have the chance
of playing a game...

258
00:17:15,877 --> 00:17:18,627
where the odds of winning
are one in six.

259
00:17:18,725 --> 00:17:21,441
One in six.

260
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:24,165
It's one throw...

261
00:17:26,341 --> 00:17:28,283
of the dice.

262
00:17:32,925 --> 00:17:34,497
This is my attorney,
Mr. Grisham...

263
00:17:34,564 --> 00:17:37,793
who tragically was born
without a personality.

264
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:42,083
Mr. Grisham insists anyone who wishes
to participate in our little experiment...

265
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:46,882
sign this waiver, absolving the casino
from responsibility or damages...

266
00:17:46,947 --> 00:17:50,592
<i>personal liability,
blah, blah, blah.</i>

267
00:17:50,691 --> 00:17:53,953
So, who do you like, Claude?

268
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:56,866
The young woman in the black coat.
She looks desperate.

269
00:17:56,963 --> 00:17:59,297
Yes, but she has
her mother with her.

270
00:17:59,363 --> 00:18:02,166
- That could slow her down, hmm?
- Perhaps.

271
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:06,274
Now, 563 miles from here...

272
00:18:06,338 --> 00:18:09,768
is a little town called
Silver City, New Mexico.

273
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:11,549
- Gold rush.
- Quite right, Nick.

274
00:18:11,618 --> 00:18:13,887
Yes, they struck gold there
in 1860.

275
00:18:13,953 --> 00:18:16,577
It was the second largest
gold rush in American history.

276
00:18:16,706 --> 00:18:21,048
Very good, Nick. I think
Nick should be our captain.

277
00:18:23,842 --> 00:18:27,354
In downtown Silver City,
there's a train station.

278
00:18:27,457 --> 00:18:30,459
As you go in the front door,
there's some lockers on the right.

279
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:32,837
Mr. Grisham,
do you have the keys?

280
00:18:33,473 --> 00:18:35,360
Six identical keys.

281
00:18:36,225 --> 00:18:38,429
They all open the same locker.

282
00:18:38,497 --> 00:18:41,246
That's locker 001.

283
00:18:41,312 --> 00:18:44,858
Inside the locker is a red duffel
bag. Inside the red duffel bag...

284
00:18:44,928 --> 00:18:47,918
is $2 million.

285
00:18:48,012 --> 00:18:51,804
In cash, fifties and hundreds,
makes a pile about so big.

286
00:18:51,872 --> 00:18:54,774
First one there keeps it all.

287
00:18:56,384 --> 00:19:00,890
And I put transmitting devices in
your key rings to keep track of you.

288
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,853
And that's it.

289
00:19:05,193 --> 00:19:06,087
Go.

290
00:19:08,693 --> 00:19:10,683
You just can't pick people
at random.

291
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,019
I can do anything I like, Owen.
I'm eccentric.

292
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,484
Go!

293
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,168
Wait, wait.
So, it's like a race?

294
00:19:19,294 --> 00:19:21,433
A race. It's a race.

295
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,134
I hope I win.

296
00:19:24,183 --> 00:19:26,189
What are the rules?

297
00:19:26,204 --> 00:19:29,782
There's only one rule.
Are you ready? Here it is.

298
00:19:30,174 --> 00:19:33,403
There are no rules.

299
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,324
Go.

300
00:19:37,053 --> 00:19:38,025
Go!

301
00:19:38,064 --> 00:19:42,971
So now when you say, "go",
you mean just go?

302
00:19:43,588 --> 00:19:46,416
Begin, commence, start moving.

303
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,077
Theoretically, you have been
racing for about 40 seconds.

304
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,434
And so far, Mr. Schaffer is winning...

305
00:19:52,508 --> 00:19:55,323
because he's nearest to the door.

306
00:20:02,908 --> 00:20:04,566
You're crazy!

307
00:20:05,002 --> 00:20:08,497
A race! A race!
You have to pace yourself.

308
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:12,378
Carbohydrate is important.
Pasta is good.

309
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:14,963
Breathing is important.

310
00:20:16,714 --> 00:20:20,504
Scusi. One, two...

311
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:23,527
- It's some sort of joke. It has to be.
- Yeah.

312
00:20:23,582 --> 00:20:26,551
What kind of jackass
just gives away $2 million?

313
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:29,489
Maybe it's a publicity stunt.

314
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,278
What kind of publicity?
He swore us all to secrecy.

315
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:36,950
- Maybe it's a secret publicity stunt.
- A secret publicity stunt?

316
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,424
Yes!

317
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,638
I don't know what his angle is,
but there's always an angle.

318
00:20:40,716 --> 00:20:43,472
Donald Sinclair... People like him
make millions of dollars...

319
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:46,164
<i>every day playing people
like us for chumps.</i>

320
00:20:46,233 --> 00:20:49,130
<i>- I'm nobody's chump.
- So you don't believe...</i>

321
00:20:49,143 --> 00:20:52,820
11:30, non-stop to Chicago.
I'm gonna be on it.

322
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,967
You know what? He's right.

323
00:20:54,968 --> 00:20:57,357
I'm not cuttin' short
my first family vacation...

324
00:20:57,433 --> 00:21:00,315
in three years to go on
some half-assed wild goose chase.

325
00:21:00,436 --> 00:21:03,981
Okay, so,
you're not goin' for it?

326
00:21:04,608 --> 00:21:05,924
- No.
- No.

327
00:21:05,925 --> 00:21:07,356
I don't think so.

328
00:21:07,357 --> 00:21:09,783
- Not me, no.
- No. Great.

329
00:21:09,784 --> 00:21:12,118
- I guess that's that, huh?
- Right.

330
00:21:12,668 --> 00:21:14,769
It was nice meetin' y'all.
I'm gonna take the stairs.

331
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:17,687
My room's just two floors down,
so nice meetin' ya.

332
00:21:17,751 --> 00:21:19,889
Hey, have a nice vacation.

333
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:29,730
You know, it's probably stuck.

334
00:21:30,383 --> 00:21:33,230
I think I'm gonna
take the stairs too.

335
00:21:41,581 --> 00:21:42,093
Crap.

336
00:21:45,342 --> 00:21:47,610
- Go, go, go, go!
- Come on, Vera!

337
00:21:51,861 --> 00:21:54,349
Watch out!

338
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:57,614
Comin' through!

339
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:03,822
Hold the door, please.

340
00:22:03,892 --> 00:22:06,543
Take your time. No rush.

341
00:22:06,612 --> 00:22:08,877
- Get up!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

342
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:13,736
This is crazy! Listen, if we're all gonna
go for it, why don't we go for it together?

343
00:22:13,775 --> 00:22:16,509
You know, split the money 50-50.

344
00:22:16,572 --> 00:22:19,792
- Fifty-fifty?
- You know what I mean, 50-50. Whatever. Whatever.

345
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,714
Yes, yes, that's a good plan.

346
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:24,747
It's a race. It's a race.

347
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:27,819
I'm winning. I'm winning.

348
00:22:30,931 --> 00:22:32,622
And they're off!

349
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:38,908
No one... No one is offering you
action like this.

350
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:41,779
A horse race with animals
that can think and plan...

351
00:22:41,842 --> 00:22:46,479
and lie and cheat
and play dirty.

352
00:22:46,546 --> 00:22:49,677
It's the gambling experience
of a lifetime.

353
00:22:49,746 --> 00:22:53,870
It's my way of saying
I understand men like you.

354
00:22:53,938 --> 00:22:55,694
I know what you want.
I know what you need.

355
00:22:55,762 --> 00:23:00,464
This casino... my casino...
is where you belong.

356
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:04,975
- I got it!
- Excuse me!

357
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:07,310
- To the airport.
- You got it.

358
00:23:07,377 --> 00:23:09,898
We're out the door.
I don't see you. Where are you?

359
00:23:09,937 --> 00:23:14,159
- I forgot to tip the maid. I always tip the maid.
- Forget the maid. There he is!

360
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:16,559
- Come on! Let's go!
- Okay, okay.

361
00:23:17,585 --> 00:23:21,676
Bev, this is a real job!
I swear!

362
00:23:23,024 --> 00:23:24,301
What is it?

363
00:23:26,383 --> 00:23:28,325
The job? What's the job?

364
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:32,718
Ink for fountain pens.

365
00:23:35,056 --> 00:23:37,903
- And they're in New Mexico?
- Silver City, New Mexico.

366
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:41,545
I love New Mexico.
Honey, we'll go with you.

367
00:23:42,091 --> 00:23:44,709
- No!
- Why not?

368
00:23:45,103 --> 00:23:49,031
Because we've already paid for the
room. Now look who's wasting money.

369
00:23:50,094 --> 00:23:51,982
No. This was your idea to stop here.

370
00:23:52,047 --> 00:23:55,109
I don't care about David Copperfield. This
is our family vacation. We'll go with you.

371
00:23:55,137 --> 00:23:58,486
- But you don't understand...
- We will go with you!

372
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:02,790
- Fine.
- Yes!

373
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:05,571
Fine. Fine. Here. Call the bellman.
Have him bring the van around.

374
00:24:05,572 --> 00:24:07,525
- You happy? You happy?
- Okay.

375
00:24:07,598 --> 00:24:11,875
Scusi. Scusi.
I'm in a race. Scusi.

376
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,568
Scusi. It's a race.

377
00:24:28,962 --> 00:24:31,681
- What is he doing?
- I think he's sleeping.

378
00:24:31,712 --> 00:24:33,547
- Sleeping?
- He must be narcoleptic.

379
00:24:33,612 --> 00:24:35,467
It's a rare sleeping disorder.

380
00:24:35,532 --> 00:24:38,761
- But I bet on him!
- So did I. Two million dollars.

381
00:24:38,828 --> 00:24:41,627
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
All the bets are locked in.

382
00:24:41,682 --> 00:24:43,570
Sleeping! Sleeping!

383
00:24:51,371 --> 00:24:53,345
- Look out!
- Don't tell me how to drive!

384
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:55,131
It's only yellow.
It's only yellow. Run it!

385
00:24:56,971 --> 00:25:00,484
- Where's my video game?
- Seat belts, everyone.

386
00:25:00,555 --> 00:25:05,139
- Honey, what is the rush?
- I don't wanna be late It's the opportunity of a lifetime.

387
00:25:05,202 --> 00:25:07,852
You're not just a travel agent,
Roger. You're an angel.

388
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:09,921
There's one charter plane
available in Las Vegas.

389
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,009
And we just bagged it.

390
00:25:12,074 --> 00:25:13,929
<i>- Back to pass.</i>
- Get rid of it.

391
00:25:13,994 --> 00:25:17,343
<i>- Looks to his left.</i>
- Get rid of it. Throw the ball!

392
00:25:17,418 --> 00:25:19,064
That's why you're not
gonna get drafted!

393
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:23,179
You'll be lucky to play
arena football in Barcelona!

394
00:25:23,241 --> 00:25:25,607
- You like football?
- Sure.

395
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,897
Did you happen to catch
that Dallas game last week?

396
00:25:30,015 --> 00:25:34,465
You can't really call it a game. It was an
obscenity. It was a crime against football.

397
00:25:34,537 --> 00:25:37,155
I lost 20 grand on that game!
And they would have won!

398
00:25:37,225 --> 00:25:40,541
Now I gotta work two shifts
because of that idiot!

399
00:25:40,617 --> 00:25:44,610
I mean, Stevie Wonder could have done
a better job calling that game.

400
00:25:46,728 --> 00:25:48,583
Where the hell's the airport?

401
00:25:50,472 --> 00:25:53,920
One lousy flip of the coin and the franchise
goes straight down the crapper.

402
00:25:54,023 --> 00:25:56,546
- That'll be 10.50, buddy.
- Okay, keep the change.

403
00:25:57,392 --> 00:26:00,580
Thanks a lot.
You have a nice flight. Yeah!

404
00:26:00,943 --> 00:26:02,726
You know who that was?

405
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:06,589
That was the ref. The guy
from the game? The coin toss!

406
00:26:06,663 --> 00:26:10,043
Oh, my God!
You're right! That was him!

407
00:26:10,097 --> 00:26:12,060
I had him in the cab,
and I let him go!

408
00:26:12,061 --> 00:26:14,400
- Where are we going?
- We gotta go. Come on. Just go.

409
00:26:14,471 --> 00:26:17,569
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Chumps.

410
00:26:42,158 --> 00:26:44,230
Excuse me. Hi.

411
00:26:44,677 --> 00:26:47,972
- I'm not a creep or anything.
- I don't have any quarters.

412
00:26:50,212 --> 00:26:53,138
I never do this, but I'm
reading the same book you are.

413
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:55,452
Look. See? Lindbergh.

414
00:26:56,271 --> 00:26:57,826
It's fantastic, isn't it?

415
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:01,121
- What part are you on?
- He just had a sex change.

416
00:27:01,757 --> 00:27:03,764
Who did? Lindbergh?

417
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,156
- Sex change?
- Yeah.

418
00:27:10,594 --> 00:27:11,164
That's funny.

419
00:27:11,203 --> 00:27:12,606
- I thought so.
- That's funny.

420
00:27:12,675 --> 00:27:14,790
I wouldn't be too proud
of yourself though.

421
00:27:14,837 --> 00:27:16,692
I'm the most gullible guy
in Chicago.

422
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:22,173
Can I buy you a drink?

423
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:24,043
I can't. I'm flying.

424
00:27:24,365 --> 00:27:29,221
- So, it'll relax you.
- No, no, I mean, I'm flying. I'm a pilot.

425
00:27:32,002 --> 00:27:34,719
Pilot? Are there
a lot of female pilots?

426
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,576
There's at least one.

427
00:27:41,112 --> 00:27:44,275
You know, as soon as I walk away, I'm gonna
think of something great to say to that.

428
00:27:44,297 --> 00:27:46,785
Good. Mail it to me.

429
00:27:51,622 --> 00:27:53,548
Flight 115 to
Albuquerque, New Mexico.

430
00:27:53,595 --> 00:27:57,173
- Gate 17. You better hurry.
- Four tickets to Albuquerque, please.

431
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,611
- Near the front of the plane. Please.
- All right.

432
00:27:59,635 --> 00:28:01,490
Come on!

433
00:28:01,856 --> 00:28:04,856
This is so exciting. I've never
been on a private plane before.

434
00:28:04,928 --> 00:28:06,870
This is bigger than my condo.

435
00:28:06,944 --> 00:28:09,529
- Gentlemen, what's our ETA?
- One hour and ten minutes.

436
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,990
If you can do it in less than
an hour, I'll buy you both dinner.

437
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:14,329
You're on...

438
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:17,936
- Watch it. Move. Excuse me. Move.
- Move! Move! Move!

439
00:28:18,225 --> 00:28:19,262
- Who was next?
- I was!

440
00:28:19,327 --> 00:28:20,772
- I was!
- I was!

441
00:28:20,818 --> 00:28:23,225
- What? You were not next!
- Are you callin' me a liar?

442
00:28:23,295 --> 00:28:26,521
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am. We've
been in line back here over 20 minutes.

443
00:28:26,568 --> 00:28:30,139
- Okay, hold on. Is that the correct time?
- Hey! Whoa!

444
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:32,312
Yes, it is.

445
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:35,449
- Who's next?
- They were, right there.

446
00:28:35,518 --> 00:28:38,169
Two tickets to Albuquerque.

447
00:28:38,238 --> 00:28:42,995
I'm sorry. We're completely booked.
There's nothing.

448
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:45,832
There's a 4:30,
but you have to switch in Dallas.

449
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:54,297
What do you mean that's it? I'm
not givin' up and neither are you.

450
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:57,911
And neither am I!
I'll tell you something, brother.

451
00:28:58,074 --> 00:29:01,848
If we're not flyin' outta here,
no one is flyin' outta here.

452
00:29:59,819 --> 00:30:01,194
That can't be good.

453
00:30:07,836 --> 00:30:10,324
Duane!

454
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,394
No!

455
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,709
Blaine! Blaine!

456
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:40,136
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

457
00:30:47,122 --> 00:30:47,823
Shit!

458
00:30:58,263 --> 00:31:01,491
I can't!

459
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:05,518
What are you doin'?
I don't know where to go!

460
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,445
- Move!
- Trying to kill me?

461
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:11,601
Duane, stop the car!
Stop the car!

462
00:31:22,229 --> 00:31:23,596
Whoa, girl! Jesus!

463
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:42,225
Freeze everything, every flight.
Get me Central Operations.

464
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,258
<i>Attention all passengers.</i>

465
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:48,690
<i>Due to a technical problem
with our radar tracking system...</i>

466
00:31:48,755 --> 00:31:51,122
<i>all flights are postponed
until further notice.</i>

467
00:31:51,187 --> 00:31:54,253
<i>We apologize for
any inconvenience.</i>

468
00:31:55,795 --> 00:31:56,656
Come on. We gotta go.
We gotta go.

469
00:31:56,755 --> 00:31:57,965
- Hurry up!
- The bags?

470
00:31:58,067 --> 00:31:59,922
Forget the bags! Let's go!

471
00:31:59,987 --> 00:32:02,190
Comin' through!

472
00:32:03,608 --> 00:32:06,317
- This is your license?
- Yes, it is.

473
00:32:07,455 --> 00:32:09,561
- Where was it issued?
- In Guam.

474
00:32:12,978 --> 00:32:15,498
Just head east,
and I'm in a hurry.

475
00:32:16,337 --> 00:32:20,560
Hello again. East it is.

476
00:32:22,033 --> 00:32:24,967
We have a mid-sized Caprice.

477
00:32:25,572 --> 00:32:27,759
- What colour is it?
- We don't care about colour.

478
00:32:27,814 --> 00:32:30,533
Just give us whatever car
is parked closest to the door.

479
00:32:30,618 --> 00:32:32,613
Ask about insurance.

480
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:36,173
Would you be interested
in purchasing liability insurance?

481
00:32:36,494 --> 00:32:38,931
- How much is it?
- It doesn't matter. We'll take it.

482
00:32:38,965 --> 00:32:40,874
Just hurry.

483
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,130
Hit enter. Now shift.

484
00:32:48,153 --> 00:32:49,989
Shift key. Right there. Yeah.

485
00:32:53,868 --> 00:32:54,805
Hey, watch it!

486
00:32:55,402 --> 00:32:57,922
Bus! White people!

487
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:01,807
Idiot!

488
00:33:02,873 --> 00:33:04,880
Okay, I've got one.

489
00:33:06,281 --> 00:33:08,219
- What?
- A great comeback.

490
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,048
- Okay.
- Okay.

491
00:33:10,327 --> 00:33:12,302
I said, "Are there
a lot of female pilots?"

492
00:33:12,338 --> 00:33:14,247
And you said,
"There's at least one."

493
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:17,606
I should have said,
"Two if you count Lindbergh."

494
00:33:18,892 --> 00:33:20,801
'Cause you said
he had a sex change.

495
00:33:21,421 --> 00:33:23,276
- It's a work in progress.
- Okay.

496
00:33:23,277 --> 00:33:25,873
- I'm Nick Schaffer.
- Tracy Faucet.

497
00:33:25,928 --> 00:33:27,803
So I guess you can have
that drink now.

498
00:33:27,866 --> 00:33:30,562
I told you I'm flying. I'm leaving
for Roswell in five minutes.

499
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:32,809
Didn't you hear?
Everybody's grounded.

500
00:33:33,574 --> 00:33:38,105
Oh, no. That's for fixed wing. I'm in a
chopper. We use a different system.

501
00:33:43,118 --> 00:33:45,751
Roswell, New Mexico?

502
00:33:46,886 --> 00:33:50,626
- You're flying to New Mexico?
- Yeah, we've been flying down all week.

503
00:33:50,672 --> 00:33:52,561
They're repainting
the whole fleet.

504
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:59,775
You can fly.
Nobody else can fly.

505
00:33:59,983 --> 00:34:02,950
But you can fly.

506
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,876
- And you're flying to New Mexico.
- Yeah.

507
00:34:05,971 --> 00:34:08,938
- But nobody else can fly.
- Yeah.

508
00:34:09,152 --> 00:34:12,283
Do you need a ride?

509
00:34:15,475 --> 00:34:17,896
Come on!

510
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,773
- Coconut.
- Coconut! Who had coconut?

511
00:34:25,842 --> 00:34:28,526
I did.

512
00:34:29,273 --> 00:34:30,252
Phil.

513
00:34:32,277 --> 00:34:33,769
That's the kind of car
that I'm gettin'.

514
00:34:33,842 --> 00:34:36,493
- Yeah? Don't count on it.
- Why not?

515
00:34:36,562 --> 00:34:39,431
Because the Volkswagen Beetle
was used by the Nazis.

516
00:34:40,192 --> 00:34:42,636
I would not be comfortable
driving around in one.

517
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:46,960
- So, don't drive it. I will.
- Dad, I have to go.

518
00:34:47,025 --> 00:34:50,652
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do. I really do.

519
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:54,572
- We just stopped!
- I couldn't go. The bathroom was too gross.

520
00:34:54,641 --> 00:34:59,320
- Well, can't you hold it in?
- I can't! It's an emergency.

521
00:34:59,367 --> 00:35:00,547
Honey, there's a restaurant.

522
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,599
No, that's three miles of the road and
then three miles back. We lose ten minutes.

523
00:35:03,652 --> 00:35:05,791
So what? Your daughter
has to go to the bathroom.

524
00:35:05,851 --> 00:35:07,513
- Please stop, Dad.
- All right.

525
00:35:07,552 --> 00:35:10,568
Jason, look back there
for an empty jar.

526
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:13,156
A jar? Girls don't pee in jars.

527
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:14,469
All right, sorry.

528
00:35:14,539 --> 00:35:18,120
Jason, we're gonna
need a jar and a funnel.

529
00:35:18,597 --> 00:35:21,085
Dad, I don't have to pee.
It's number two!

530
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:25,320
- Sorry, I can't stop.
- Dad, I'm prairie-dogging it.

531
00:35:25,321 --> 00:35:26,662
What the hell does that mean?

532
00:35:26,948 --> 00:35:30,493
You know, like when a prairie dog sticks
his head in and out of the ground.

533
00:35:34,511 --> 00:35:36,932
I do not want to picture that.

534
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,557
Yes, sir, Silver City it is.

535
00:35:40,558 --> 00:35:43,722
- Buddy.
- It's about 700 miles.

536
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:47,979
- You don't mind, do ya?
- Oh, no. No, no, no, I don't mind.

537
00:35:48,046 --> 00:35:51,307
A job's just another job for me.

538
00:35:51,373 --> 00:35:54,243
About how much you think
that's gonna cost?

539
00:35:54,349 --> 00:35:58,855
I wouldn't worry about it.
Tell you what.

540
00:35:58,925 --> 00:36:02,951
You just pay me
whatever you think is fair...

541
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:07,657
'cause I trust your judgement.

542
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,278
I hate you. I hate you!

543
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:14,023
All right, nobody look. I'm gonna turn on
the radio, honey, so nobody can hear you.

544
00:36:14,062 --> 00:36:16,271
I'll never forgive this.
I hate you.

545
00:36:16,302 --> 00:36:19,236
Okay, nobody can hear you, honey.
Push away.

546
00:36:27,531 --> 00:36:30,531
I'm gonna drop you off there. There's
a parking lot right near the hospital.

547
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:33,920
- Great. Great.
- So what's wrong with her?

548
00:36:34,027 --> 00:36:36,809
- Who?
- Your sister. You said it's serious.

549
00:36:39,339 --> 00:36:41,510
Yeah. Shark bite.

550
00:36:42,538 --> 00:36:45,189
- A shark bite?
- Yeah.

551
00:36:45,258 --> 00:36:47,778
They took her to Silver City?

552
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:51,079
They have a really good
shark attack unit there.

553
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,584
How fast was I going?

554
00:37:07,881 --> 00:37:11,678
- Where are we?
- It's a shortcut I know.

555
00:37:11,753 --> 00:37:15,582
- Well, maybe we should stick to the highway.
- There's a thought.

556
00:37:15,657 --> 00:37:19,715
You say we should stick to the highway.
I say we should take my shortcut.

557
00:37:19,784 --> 00:37:24,290
- Why don't we just flip a coin?
- It's not what you think.

558
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,906
- Come here, you blind son of a bitch!
- Wait! Stop it!

559
00:37:26,977 --> 00:37:28,289
You wanted that whistle?

560
00:37:28,305 --> 00:37:31,170
Give me that goddamn whistle!
I'm gonna shove it up your ass!

561
00:37:31,272 --> 00:37:33,344
- Come back here!
- Arrivederci

562
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:39,138
Shit.

563
00:37:41,255 --> 00:37:43,676
I'll kill him.

564
00:38:00,422 --> 00:38:03,437
- Squirrel?
- No, thank you.

565
00:38:03,468 --> 00:38:04,788
We're looking for the interstate.

566
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:08,382
I get that a lot
'cause of the detour.

567
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:12,130
Now they've lost their way.

568
00:38:12,198 --> 00:38:16,708
Now they can't go home.
You sure you don't want one?

569
00:38:16,854 --> 00:38:18,122
We're sure. Thank you.

570
00:38:18,152 --> 00:38:21,604
They make crackerjack pets.
I taught this one to shake hands.

571
00:38:21,605 --> 00:38:25,876
He's not for sale though. Who wants
to go home with the nice ladies?

572
00:38:25,947 --> 00:38:29,275
"Pick me. Pick me.
Don't be afraid. I don't bite.

573
00:38:29,337 --> 00:38:32,962
- "What's your name, pretty lady?"
- Vera.

574
00:38:33,028 --> 00:38:35,329
Ma'am, really.
We're not interested.

575
00:38:35,615 --> 00:38:38,476
Well, I'm not talkin' to you, am I?
I'm talkin' to Vera.

576
00:38:38,477 --> 00:38:42,690
What about Bucky here? He just loves
to climb trees and eat the nuts.

577
00:38:42,756 --> 00:38:44,763
Ma'am, we do not
want a squirrel.

578
00:38:44,836 --> 00:38:46,875
Do you or do you not know
where the interstate is?

579
00:38:46,947 --> 00:38:50,209
Of course I do. I'm not retarded.
"Tell 'em about the shortcut."

580
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,321
Thank you, Bucky.

581
00:38:53,353 --> 00:38:55,906
I almost forgot.
There's a dandy shortcut.

582
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:59,095
It'll bring you right to exit 14.
It'll save you 30 miles.

583
00:39:00,173 --> 00:39:01,561
Okay, now listen carefully.

584
00:39:01,634 --> 00:39:04,950
You want to go straight
down here exactly 1.8 miles.

585
00:39:05,058 --> 00:39:09,149
- 1.8.
- Make a left at Totem Pole Ranch.

586
00:39:09,218 --> 00:39:11,869
Go 5.4 miles and
you're gonna go up a big hill.

587
00:39:11,938 --> 00:39:15,385
You'll see a big yellow sign
with some graffiti on it.

588
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:19,833
There's a little dirt road. Take that on the
right. It'll take you right to the interstate.

589
00:39:19,906 --> 00:39:21,007
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

590
00:39:21,023 --> 00:39:25,375
Wait a minute.
Take some nuts with you...

591
00:39:25,441 --> 00:39:27,994
just in case
you see a squirrel, okay?

592
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:33,663
"Bye. Bye.
You could have bought me."

593
00:39:33,729 --> 00:39:36,347
You'll make it. You'll make it.

594
00:39:43,344 --> 00:39:44,970
Where am I?

595
00:39:48,235 --> 00:39:51,079
Wow! A Barbie Museum!
Can we stop?

596
00:39:51,149 --> 00:39:55,430
Sorry, Kimmy. We have a plan,
and we're gonna stick to the plan.

597
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,342
Please, Daddy. Please, please,
please, please, please.

598
00:39:57,407 --> 00:39:59,709
- Hey, hey!
- It's not fair.

599
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:02,295
We never get to stop
anywhere I want to.

600
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:05,465
I'm sure Jason doesn't want
to go to the Barbie Museum.

601
00:40:05,534 --> 00:40:09,252
Are you kiddin'? I'll stop anywhere.
I'm wiggin' out back here.

602
00:40:09,299 --> 00:40:12,380
Okay, honey. Come on, you need to pull
over and stop to give the kids a break.

603
00:40:12,478 --> 00:40:14,005
Yeah, okay,
maybe on the way back.

604
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:16,243
- No, no, no. Stop the car.
- No, I can't do that.

605
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:18,237
- We all need to stop the car.
- No can do.

606
00:40:18,334 --> 00:40:20,603
- You need to stop the car.
- No!

607
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,077
Stop the car!

608
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,931
Okay, fine, but 10 minutes.

609
00:40:31,247 --> 00:40:34,443
Wow! The Barbie Museum.

610
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:36,572
Klaus Barbie...

611
00:40:36,573 --> 00:40:39,291
sometimes known as
the Butcher of Lyons.

612
00:40:39,432 --> 00:40:42,707
Let the Jew revisionists
talk about their death camps...

613
00:40:42,813 --> 00:40:45,628
and so-called crimes
against humanity.

614
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:50,875
This museum is lovingly dedicated to
the Klaus Barbie that nobody knows.

615
00:40:51,112 --> 00:40:54,659
The husband, the devoted father,
the wine connoisseur...

616
00:40:54,707 --> 00:40:57,745
and three-time
ballroom dancing champion.

617
00:41:04,284 --> 00:41:06,934
Hey, hey, there's that guy,
the udgy one.

618
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:12,408
Barbie joined the SS in 1935...

619
00:41:12,475 --> 00:41:16,826
where he soon became one of
the Führer's favourite young officers.

620
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:18,520
Can we go?

621
00:41:18,915 --> 00:41:21,981
Here we see him standing
beside Hitler's touring car...

622
00:41:21,987 --> 00:41:25,948
the very same car on display
outside in our courtyard.

623
00:41:26,075 --> 00:41:27,285
You're leaving?

624
00:41:28,474 --> 00:41:30,449
What...

625
00:41:30,522 --> 00:41:35,061
No... Yes. Well, we have a 4:30
book burning, and then we have a...

626
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,072
- A christening.
- Yes, a christening...

627
00:41:37,145 --> 00:41:41,007
for one of our many white,
Christian, non-Jewish friends...

628
00:41:41,114 --> 00:41:46,547
- Family. Blood relatives.
- The Himmler Hessin Von Sturichberg...

629
00:41:46,617 --> 00:41:48,984
- Thank you so much.
- Yes, love your do.

630
00:41:49,081 --> 00:41:50,990
Thank you. It's beautiful.
We had a great time.

631
00:41:52,281 --> 00:41:53,874
Wow! A gift shop.

632
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:57,109
Yes, I know, honey. Next time.
I promise. I really do.

633
00:41:57,177 --> 00:41:59,086
Just go. Just go.

634
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:04,417
- What? What is...? Oh, my God! We've been cut!
- What do we do now?

635
00:42:05,071 --> 00:42:06,152
I say we take the interstate.

636
00:42:06,168 --> 00:42:09,550
No, ake Highway well.
That's a shortcut.

637
00:42:09,623 --> 00:42:13,169
You don't know what the shortcut is. It
could be anything. It could be a dirt road.

638
00:42:13,271 --> 00:42:17,013
You know what? There are
oo of us. Why don't we separate?

639
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:19,927
- What?
- There's oo of us.

640
00:42:20,021 --> 00:42:23,282
Amy we should ust eparate.

641
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:26,864
You're right. You're a genius.
There's two of us.

642
00:42:26,935 --> 00:42:29,750
If we separate and you steal a car,
we can both go our own way...

643
00:42:29,815 --> 00:42:31,702
and double our chances
of gettin' there first.

644
00:42:31,703 --> 00:42:34,221
All right. You take the...

645
00:42:34,396 --> 00:42:36,600
We only got one ee.

646
00:42:38,838 --> 00:42:42,799
Look, there it is.
Totem Pole Ranch, turn left.

647
00:42:42,869 --> 00:42:47,059
1.8 miles exactly.
All right, squirrel lady.

648
00:42:51,455 --> 00:42:55,407
I can't believe it, Dad. You stole
Adolf Hitler's Mercedes-Benz.

649
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:59,568
Well, Hitler had it comin'.
What goes around comes around.

650
00:43:00,112 --> 00:43:01,898
Man, they're gonna be pissed.

651
00:43:02,276 --> 00:43:05,964
They're always pissed, honey. They're
Nazis. It's like it's their job.

652
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:11,534
Hey honey, when we get to Silver City,
we'll call 'em. We'll work somethin' out.

653
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:17,897
North?

654
00:43:17,908 --> 00:43:20,242
A little detour.
It'll just take a minute.

655
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:22,930
I just wanted to say hi
to my boyfriend.

656
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:34,123
I can't believe it.
That... That son of a bitch!

657
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:37,007
That's Charlene's car.

658
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:39,968
- Charlene?
- His ex-girlfriend, or so I thought.

659
00:43:40,015 --> 00:43:43,093
Come on now. I'm sure there's
a perfectly innocent explanation.

660
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:46,789
She probably came by just
to pick up some clothes or...

661
00:43:46,851 --> 00:43:49,753
Nice and warm.

662
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:52,320
Okay.

663
00:43:55,473 --> 00:43:56,902
What the...

664
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,148
Get down!

665
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:04,457
Did I come at
a bad time, asshole?

666
00:44:07,461 --> 00:44:11,235
I'll ram this helicopter
right down your throat!

667
00:44:12,423 --> 00:44:13,314
No!

668
00:44:16,229 --> 00:44:16,762
What are you doing?

669
00:44:16,784 --> 00:44:20,835
Don't worry about me. My father's a navy
pilot. I've been flying since I was 15.

670
00:44:20,944 --> 00:44:23,410
I'm not worried about you.
I'm worried about me.

671
00:44:23,418 --> 00:44:28,102
Shawn, you have a minute? I want
to talk about our relationship.

672
00:44:41,647 --> 00:44:43,337
Suck on that, creep!

673
00:44:45,935 --> 00:44:48,750
- That's...
- Not the truck!

674
00:44:48,815 --> 00:44:51,630
Oh, my God!

675
00:44:51,727 --> 00:44:54,105
Come on. Help me. Open it.

676
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:56,073
You know what, Tracy, I'm
actually not comfortable...

677
00:44:56,098 --> 00:44:57,953
- Open it!
- Okay.

678
00:45:03,662 --> 00:45:05,036
She's gonna kill me.

679
00:45:05,101 --> 00:45:07,108
- We should get outta here.
- Not yet!

680
00:45:07,164 --> 00:45:07,789
Okay.

681
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:11,971
You two-timing,
backstabbing snake!

682
00:45:12,046 --> 00:45:14,803
You worm! You turd!

683
00:45:16,909 --> 00:45:22,375
My God! What was I thinking?
I want my five months back!

684
00:45:24,108 --> 00:45:26,529
I'm getting the tattoo removed!

685
00:45:30,124 --> 00:45:32,012
Stop hitting me!

686
00:45:32,076 --> 00:45:35,337
Where are you goin', baby?
Wait for me!

687
00:45:54,341 --> 00:45:55,873
I think we just killed him.

688
00:45:55,899 --> 00:45:58,937
You can't kill him! He's
like a cockroach.

689
00:46:02,341 --> 00:46:04,577
No, no, no, no!

690
00:46:04,593 --> 00:46:05,935
No, fix the...

691
00:46:10,468 --> 00:46:12,443
Should we be this low?

692
00:46:16,554 --> 00:46:19,783
Come on. Come on.
Let's keep goin'. Come on.

693
00:46:23,145 --> 00:46:26,374
We just violated
about 115 federal laws.

694
00:46:26,441 --> 00:46:28,994
- "We"?
- I'm getting out of here. You coming?

695
00:46:30,459 --> 00:46:32,743
No. No, no. I know things look bad...

696
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:36,389
Nice meeting you.

697
00:46:39,688 --> 00:46:41,630
Get out of the truck, Shawn.

698
00:46:43,016 --> 00:46:45,023
That's it, Tracy.
You and I are through.

699
00:46:48,456 --> 00:46:49,983
Tracy, wait!

700
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:54,933
Tracy.

701
00:46:57,668 --> 00:47:01,314
Wait. This is the first illegal thing
I've done in my adult life.

702
00:47:01,346 --> 00:47:02,822
How does it feel?

703
00:47:02,869 --> 00:47:05,923
I'm shaking, but that could be
from the helicopter crash.

704
00:47:06,424 --> 00:47:10,049
- Get out of my truck, Tracy!
- It's my truck, Shawn! I paid for it!

705
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:11,645
- Who is this?
- I'm nobody.

706
00:47:11,718 --> 00:47:13,761
- You are nobody.
- Yeah, nobody.

707
00:47:13,785 --> 00:47:17,254
You stay away from her, nobody, unless
you're tired of livin', you know what I'm...

708
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:22,176
Oh, Shawn, while you're here, do me a
favour. Charlene left a bra in the truck.

709
00:47:22,246 --> 00:47:25,508
Could you make sure
she gets it? Thanks, honey.

710
00:47:26,019 --> 00:47:27,033
Help!

711
00:48:12,899 --> 00:48:16,218
- So where's the driver?
- He's in the powder room.

712
00:48:16,272 --> 00:48:19,421
Hell's bells. We're never
gonna get to Santa Fe by 3:00.

713
00:48:19,491 --> 00:48:21,346
- This is ridiculous.
- Ridiculous.

714
00:48:21,411 --> 00:48:25,251
I really wish he'd hurry.
It just seems very unprofessional.

715
00:48:32,671 --> 00:48:34,710
Mister, you gotta help me.
My wife...

716
00:48:34,749 --> 00:48:36,413
She's out back.
She's having a baby.

717
00:48:36,453 --> 00:48:38,171
- She's having a what?
- A baby!

718
00:48:38,178 --> 00:48:40,033
- She's having a baby?
- And it's halfway out!

719
00:48:40,348 --> 00:48:42,617
I can see the head!

720
00:48:42,763 --> 00:48:45,610
- I need your jacket.
- Why?

721
00:48:46,532 --> 00:48:48,782
For her amniotic sac!

722
00:48:48,813 --> 00:48:51,705
- Yeah, her amniotic fluid is gushing out.
- Gushing?

723
00:48:51,777 --> 00:48:54,810
The jacket! The jacket!
Give me the jacket!

724
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,695
- And your pants.
- My pants?

725
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,956
Your pants! Yeah, for her,
you know, her "placentia"...

726
00:49:01,025 --> 00:49:04,228
you know,
and her labia and cervical...

727
00:49:05,228 --> 00:49:07,735
Mucus gushing... It's gushing.

728
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,486
It's just a hole and...

729
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,793
Quick! The pants. And the hat.

730
00:49:12,997 --> 00:49:14,623
My hat? Why? Why my hat?

731
00:49:17,193 --> 00:49:18,535
For her...

732
00:49:19,888 --> 00:49:21,099
vagina.

733
00:49:23,999 --> 00:49:26,313
Let's go, ladies.
All aboard. We're on our way.

734
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:27,532
What happened to Marty?

735
00:49:27,558 --> 00:49:30,725
Marty? Family emergency.
His wife's having a baby.

736
00:49:30,768 --> 00:49:34,346
- A baby?
- I'm Owen, your new driver. Let's go.

737
00:49:35,303 --> 00:49:36,829
Quiet. Quiet, everybody.

738
00:49:36,854 --> 00:49:38,709
Simmer down. Hey!

739
00:49:39,134 --> 00:49:42,297
We're gonna be under way
in just a minute. This is Owen.

740
00:49:42,365 --> 00:49:45,082
He's our new driver.

741
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:47,516
Everyone say hello.

742
00:49:47,581 --> 00:49:51,291
Hello, Owen!

743
00:49:51,357 --> 00:49:53,812
Our next stop is
the third annual...

744
00:49:53,885 --> 00:49:57,747
I Love Lucy convention
in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

745
00:49:57,853 --> 00:50:02,603
- What do ya say?
- Ba-ba-loo!

746
00:50:33,727 --> 00:50:36,629
- Is he dead?
- Hey, mister, are you dead?

747
00:50:39,311 --> 00:50:42,246
It's a race.
It's a race. It's a race.

748
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:46,072
Run, run,
like greased lightning.

749
00:50:47,006 --> 00:50:50,232
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!

750
00:50:55,129 --> 00:50:57,301
Not good. Not good.

751
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,168
No, no, no, no!

752
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:02,683
No, no, no, no!

753
00:51:03,621 --> 00:51:05,936
Don't move! Stay there.
I saw the whole thing.

754
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:07,793
I'll be right down.

755
00:51:07,809 --> 00:51:10,866
Shit! Gloria Allred.

756
00:51:10,936 --> 00:51:14,133
Hey, buddy?
Buddy, you okay? You okay?

757
00:51:14,825 --> 00:51:16,470
You're fine! You look great.

758
00:51:16,536 --> 00:51:18,445
- You don't want to report this, do you?
- Taxi!

759
00:51:18,512 --> 00:51:20,567
You don't need a taxi. Come on!
Come on!

760
00:51:20,653 --> 00:51:22,551
Where you goin'?
Maybe I can drop you off.

761
00:51:22,598 --> 00:51:25,041
Silver City, New Mexico.
I am in a race.

762
00:51:25,112 --> 00:51:27,600
Silver City?
This is your lucky day!

763
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:30,519
I'm going to El Paso.
It's right on the way.

764
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:34,260
Come on. But, look, I got
to be there by 7:00 tonight.

765
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,229
- So I'm going to be driving very fast.
- Great.

766
00:51:37,335 --> 00:51:38,229
Yeah!

767
00:51:39,607 --> 00:51:43,251
You just want one copy, 'cause
you get an extra one for half price?

768
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:45,555
Just one and hurry.

769
00:51:45,623 --> 00:51:47,478
This is the best idea
you ever had.

770
00:51:47,543 --> 00:51:49,964
We split up. We take two keys.
We double our chances of winning.

771
00:51:50,038 --> 00:51:51,151
It can't fail.

772
00:51:51,223 --> 00:51:54,539
- You remember where we're goin'?
- Silver City, New Mexico.

773
00:51:54,614 --> 00:51:57,502
Right. Train station, locker 001.

774
00:51:57,534 --> 00:51:59,115
Ero, ero, one.

775
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:01,940
Rule number one: discretion.
Don't talk to anybody.

776
00:52:01,975 --> 00:52:03,825
- I won't. I romise.
- I'm serious.

777
00:52:03,826 --> 00:52:06,351
We're talking about
$2 million in cash.

778
00:52:06,664 --> 00:52:09,860
People would just kill us
to get their hands on that key.

779
00:52:10,578 --> 00:52:12,619
I love you.

780
00:52:13,776 --> 00:52:15,631
All right, little brother,
you steal a car.

781
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,949
I'm gonna try to heal
that Corvette right there.

782
00:52:17,993 --> 00:52:19,848
I don't care what you get
as long as it's fast.

783
00:52:19,849 --> 00:52:22,722
I'll meet you in Silver City.
Don't forget your key.

784
00:52:24,596 --> 00:52:28,032
That other-ucking bastard!

785
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,926
I'll kill 'im! I'm gonna...

786
00:52:34,507 --> 00:52:35,882
There he is!

787
00:52:36,692 --> 00:52:39,343
Go! Go!

788
00:52:41,317 --> 00:52:43,481
Okay, we're at 2.4 miles.

789
00:52:43,555 --> 00:52:44,781
There's the yellow sign
with the graffiti.

790
00:52:44,826 --> 00:52:46,250
- Turn right.
- I see it.

791
00:52:46,302 --> 00:52:47,281
- Do you see it?
- I see it.

792
00:52:47,296 --> 00:52:50,198
I just love this.
This is like a treasure hunt.

793
00:52:53,506 --> 00:52:55,655
- Slow down!
- I can't!

794
00:52:59,741 --> 00:53:01,715
Help!

795
00:53:29,883 --> 00:53:34,039
I guess my favourite episode, if I
had to pick one, would be episode 34.

796
00:53:34,069 --> 00:53:37,036
Ladies, Lucys, Lucys,
stay behind the line, please.

797
00:53:37,104 --> 00:53:40,203
Remember that one when Ricky
wouldn't take his hat off?

798
00:53:40,273 --> 00:53:43,502
I don't remember that one.
It sounds like a masterpiece.

799
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,773
How about the one where
she got caught in the freezer?

800
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:50,722
Ma'am? Lucy! You have
to put that out, please.

801
00:54:00,595 --> 00:54:02,017
Lucy, your hair!

802
00:54:02,047 --> 00:54:05,571
Thank you. I couldn't decide whether
to keep it up or try something new.

803
00:54:05,621 --> 00:54:08,095
It's on fire!

804
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,990
- Stop the bus!
- We're not stoppin'!

805
00:54:18,094 --> 00:54:20,582
Just put it out!
Just put it out!

806
00:54:20,686 --> 00:54:23,174
Stop!

807
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,285
The bathroom!

808
00:54:53,386 --> 00:54:57,957
Two million dollars. Two million
dollars. Two million dollars.

809
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:02,522
Two million dollars. Two million
dollars. Two million dollars.

810
00:55:02,595 --> 00:55:05,074
The Donald Sinclair,
the billionaire?

811
00:55:05,075 --> 00:55:08,070
It sounds crazy, I know,
but I think it's on the level.

812
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:10,886
Here's the thing. We have
to decide yes or no right now.

813
00:55:11,234 --> 00:55:15,991
Okay, we're here. If everybody else had to drive,
I figure we still have a three-hour head start.

814
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:19,411
- So you're proposing?
- To form a corporation... Faucet and Schaffer.

815
00:55:19,412 --> 00:55:23,678
If we win, we split everything
50-50. You can even hold the key.

816
00:55:24,609 --> 00:55:26,202
What do ya think?

817
00:55:27,362 --> 00:55:29,783
I don't know what to think.
I'm in shock.

818
00:55:29,857 --> 00:55:34,942
Three hours ago I was sitting in the airport.
I had a job. I was reading a book.

819
00:55:35,009 --> 00:55:37,397
My grandfather used to say,
"Good things take time.

820
00:55:37,472 --> 00:55:39,960
"Great things happen all at once."

821
00:55:45,792 --> 00:55:50,232
- Jason, where'd you get that?
- I found it under the seat.

822
00:55:50,338 --> 00:55:53,237
All right, Jason, give it to me
right now. Come on. You can't play that.

823
00:55:53,263 --> 00:55:53,955
Why not?

824
00:55:54,112 --> 00:55:57,210
Because it's Hitler's harmonica.
You can't play Hitler's harmonica.

825
00:55:57,279 --> 00:56:01,247
- You're driving his car.
- Yes, but I'm not touching it with my mouth.

826
00:56:01,278 --> 00:56:05,113
I'm not sucking on the dashboard.
I'm not gettin' his germs.

827
00:56:05,114 --> 00:56:07,125
Dad, look what I found.

828
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:11,191
- Where'd you get those?
- The floor. Look, I'm Mrs. Hitler.

829
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:12,988
All right, take those
off right now.

830
00:56:13,019 --> 00:56:16,702
Hey, look at this.
A lipstick. It's dark.

831
00:56:16,767 --> 00:56:18,676
That Eva Braun had style,
didn't she?

832
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,368
- She was Hitler's girlfriend.
- Give us a kiss.

833
00:56:21,438 --> 00:56:24,285
Bev, it's not funny. Come on, give me that.
Give me that.

834
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:26,325
- Honey!
- I got it all over my hand.

835
00:56:26,429 --> 00:56:27,115
Oh...

836
00:56:27,162 --> 00:56:28,698
Randy.

837

842
00:56:47,037 --> 00:56:49,874
Look at us go. We are zooming.

843
00:56:49,913 --> 00:56:52,213
I told you. We're haulin' ass.

844
00:56:52,316 --> 00:56:55,993
We're haulin' ass. All righty.

845
00:56:59,324 --> 00:57:02,675
- Guess what I got back there.
- You just told me.

846
00:57:02,706 --> 00:57:05,111
Ass. We're haulin' ass.

847
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:07,700
No, no, no.
That's just an expression.

848
00:57:11,419 --> 00:57:12,630
It's a heart.

849
00:57:13,883 --> 00:57:17,495
- A heart?
- A human heart.

850
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:21,664
Some lucky bastard
in El Paso's waiting for it.

851
00:57:22,031 --> 00:57:26,807
Normally, they put it on a plane, but, you
know, the airport's all closed down, so...

852
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:34,232
- You wanna see it?
- See what?

853
00:57:43,258 --> 00:57:45,145
Are we allowed?

854
00:57:45,209 --> 00:57:48,689
Just take a peek. One peek.
What could happen?

855
00:57:50,489 --> 00:57:53,043
It's a heart.
It needs fresh air.

856
00:57:53,098 --> 00:57:56,216
It's been locked up
in that cooler for seven hours.

857
00:58:30,679 --> 00:58:33,362
- Oopsy-daisy. I get it. I get it.
- Shit! Oh, please!

858
00:58:33,431 --> 00:58:35,820
- Don't step on it!
- I think I found it.

859
00:58:35,895 --> 00:58:37,749
No, that's a caramel apple.

860
00:58:49,427 --> 00:58:51,818
This is wrong. This is so wrong.

861
00:58:51,842 --> 00:58:54,901
God is going to smote us.
We're gonna get smote.

862
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:57,373
Come on. We're siphoning gas.
It's not a smoting offence.

863
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,274
What?

864
00:59:05,813 --> 00:59:07,722
Shouldn't be
turning me on, should it?

865
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:13,613
- Hey!
- Hi.

866
00:59:14,059 --> 00:59:17,736
- What are you doing?
- Seventeen cups of coffee.

867
00:59:21,812 --> 00:59:23,640
I guess...

868
00:59:23,704 --> 00:59:25,526
I guess that's it.

869
00:59:27,372 --> 00:59:30,874
I guess not.
How do you turn this thing off?

870
00:59:31,475 --> 00:59:33,002
Son of a bitch!

871
00:59:40,242 --> 00:59:44,170
- Man! Damn it!
- Keep going. Go! Go! Go!

872
00:59:46,643 --> 00:59:48,497
He's stopping.

873
00:59:48,563 --> 00:59:50,472
'Cause he knows,
don't mess with us.

874
01:00:09,649 --> 01:00:11,201
We gotta wait.
There's too much wind.

875
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:15,976
- Guys, guys, guys, I need this balloon.
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?

876
01:00:16,049 --> 01:00:17,904
Hey, man, what...

877
01:00:22,321 --> 01:00:24,328
- Hey, hey!
- I know what I'm doing!

878
01:00:28,592 --> 01:00:31,887
I'm coming to get you!
Get back here!

879
01:00:36,368 --> 01:00:40,143
I'll get him. I'm gonna get you,
stupid hardware guy!

880
01:00:44,943 --> 01:00:50,377
- Go! Go!
- Stand up. Grab the rope.

881
01:00:50,447 --> 01:00:53,796
I'm gonna get you!
Stand up. Ready? Grab it.

882
01:00:55,822 --> 01:00:57,677
Missed it.

883
01:00:57,742 --> 01:01:01,800
- Duane! Duane, stop the car!
- Hang on, buddy.

884
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:03,812
Duane, please stop.

885
01:01:06,478 --> 01:01:09,512
I got it! I got it!
Just hang on.

886
01:01:17,005 --> 01:01:21,129
- Stop it! Blaine!
- My God! You're gonna kill me!

887
01:01:22,189 --> 01:01:24,044
The cows!

888
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:29,001
Move!

889
01:01:33,546 --> 01:01:34,921
Watch out!

890
01:01:54,187 --> 01:01:55,267
Shit.

891
01:02:17,578 --> 01:02:20,360
Help!

892
01:02:24,745 --> 01:02:26,479
- Give me my key.
- What are you talking about?

893
01:02:26,533 --> 01:02:28,704
Give me back my key. The key!

894
01:02:30,954 --> 01:02:32,961
Give me the key.

895
01:03:18,791 --> 01:03:22,467
Blaine! Blaine! It's me.

896
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:35,044
I got the key.

897
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:42,971
How's it going, Captain?

898
01:03:43,077 --> 01:03:44,695
So far, so good.

899
01:03:44,741 --> 01:03:48,866
- How about a pit stop?
- Sorry. This is a one-way flight.

900
01:03:48,905 --> 01:03:50,916
There's a bathroom in the back.

901
01:03:50,981 --> 01:03:53,746
The latch is broken.
Anybody could just come in.

902
01:03:53,792 --> 01:03:58,379
So what? You ain't got nothing
the other Lucys haven't seen already.

903
01:03:58,439 --> 01:03:59,535
Not necessarily.

904
01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:02,981
Please, would you
stop screaming?

905
01:04:03,296 --> 01:04:04,311
Damn!

906
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:09,634
Help me!

907
01:04:09,699 --> 01:04:12,121
For God's sake, help me!

908
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:26,555
Oh, shit.

909
01:04:32,002 --> 01:04:35,068
Owen! Owen, what are you doing?

910
01:04:35,138 --> 01:04:36,993
It's a flat tire.
Please, stay on the bus.

911
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:39,933
- Well, you're turning it the wrong way.
- I know what I'm doing.

912
01:04:39,988 --> 01:04:44,124
- Please, get on the bus. Wait!
- Maybe we should check the oil.

913
01:04:44,193 --> 01:04:47,677
I think you're supposed to change
the air in the tires every 12,000 miles.

914
01:04:47,763 --> 01:04:50,618
- I can fix it.
- Give me that!

915
01:04:52,193 --> 01:04:54,265
Wait! That's the spare!

916
01:05:02,977 --> 01:05:04,438
We'll still catch it.

917
01:05:29,406 --> 01:05:31,959
Turn it around.
Just turn it around.

918
01:05:32,031 --> 01:05:35,446
Please be careful.
Wait, wait, wait. What is that?

919
01:05:37,598 --> 01:05:40,565
- It's a nickel.
- Would you please put it in the bag?

920
01:05:57,438 --> 01:06:01,561
Why don't you check over there?
Maybe it bounced.

921
01:06:03,792 --> 01:06:07,785
- I'm a dead man.
- Don't worry, my friend. We will find the heart.

922
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:11,859
I have lost my heart
many times before.

923
01:06:15,842 --> 01:06:17,307
I make a joke...

924
01:06:17,372 --> 01:06:21,169
to help you forget
how screwed you are.

925
01:06:21,498 --> 01:06:25,913
I don't think it got this far.
Let's check down by the road.

926
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,020
Oh, hello. A doggy.

927
01:06:28,092 --> 01:06:30,328
Hello. Hello. Hello there.

928
01:06:30,395 --> 01:06:32,566
Isn't he a good doggy?

929
01:06:32,635 --> 01:06:35,123
Come on. Come on.
Fetch. Fetch it.

930
01:06:36,827 --> 01:06:39,674
Look at him go.

931
01:06:41,435 --> 01:06:43,988
- Here, boy!
- Doggy!

932
01:06:44,059 --> 01:06:45,433
Good boy!

933
01:06:50,235 --> 01:06:51,761
- It really is a beautiful car.
- Yeah.

934
01:06:52,162 --> 01:06:53,967
- I mean, look at this mahogany.
- Gorgeous.

935
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,977
You just don't see
that anymore, you know?

936
01:06:57,050 --> 01:07:00,017
- I wonder what this is.
- Honey, careful. That's a cigarette lighter.

937
01:07:00,090 --> 01:07:02,330
- No, I don't think they had those then.
- Yes, they did.

938
01:07:02,714 --> 01:07:04,721
Oh, honey!
Did you burn yourself?

939
01:07:04,793 --> 01:07:07,222
- Yeah. Oh, God!
- Oh, I told you.

940
01:07:07,848 --> 01:07:10,058
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

941
01:07:10,089 --> 01:07:12,078
Sorry.

942
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,542
My husband,
he burned his finger, ma'am.

943
01:07:14,617 --> 01:07:18,195
- He was pulling, then he was waving...
- Bev, Bev, not helping.

944
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:21,755
- Hi.
- Hi.

945
01:07:23,768 --> 01:07:26,736
I really like your dike. Bike.

946
01:07:28,888 --> 01:07:29,782
It's nice.

947
01:07:34,711 --> 01:07:37,559
Cut 'em off! Get in front!

948
01:07:38,295 --> 01:07:40,815
- Hey! What are you, nuts?
- Get down!

949
01:07:40,887 --> 01:07:42,894
Kids, stay down!
This thing won't go any faster!

950
01:07:42,967 --> 01:07:45,269
Stop it! The headlights!
The headlight!

951
01:07:45,335 --> 01:07:49,775
- Oh, my God!
- Are you insane? This is Hitler's car!

952
01:08:07,222 --> 01:08:10,386
Honey, go ask them for help.
Tell them everything that happened.

953
01:08:10,454 --> 01:08:12,755
And ask them to call the police.

954
01:08:12,821 --> 01:08:14,676
And a tow truck.

955
01:08:57,303 --> 01:08:59,309
- Hello.
- Hello.

956
01:08:59,379 --> 01:09:01,713
- Are you Harold?
- Yes.

957
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:04,177
I'm Vicky.

958
01:09:05,171 --> 01:09:07,113
Are you gonna
invite me in, Harry?

959
01:09:07,186 --> 01:09:09,194
Or would you rather
party out here in the hallway?

960
01:09:10,098 --> 01:09:11,402
Please. Come in.

961
01:09:15,218 --> 01:09:17,073
Not too shabby.

962
01:09:18,194 --> 01:09:21,115
- Where are you from, Harry?
- From here.

963
01:09:21,162 --> 01:09:24,610
- Las Vegas.
- A local boy makes good.

964
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:30,270
So, Harry,
what can I do for you?

965
01:09:30,961 --> 01:09:33,066
Okay. Here's what I want.

966
01:09:34,257 --> 01:09:35,751
First we both get naked.

967
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:40,510
- So far, so good.
- Only we're wearing sailor hats.

968
01:09:41,115 --> 01:09:42,538
And then...

969
01:09:43,281 --> 01:09:46,248
we get into a Jacuzzi...

970
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:49,132
filled with Pepto-Bismol.

971
01:09:49,155 --> 01:09:50,049
And...

972
01:09:51,184 --> 01:09:53,280
I clip your toenails...

973
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:55,689
and you shave my buttocks.

974
01:09:57,156 --> 01:09:58,765
Pardon me?

975
01:09:58,804 --> 01:10:02,882
Okay, naked,
Jacuzzi, Pepto-Bismol...

976
01:10:02,937 --> 01:10:05,576
toenails, shave my buttocks.

977
01:10:05,577 --> 01:10:07,137
How much would that cost?

978
01:10:07,162 --> 01:10:10,966
Geez, honey,
you have quite an imagination.

979
01:10:11,567 --> 01:10:12,909
How much would it cost?

980
01:10:14,991 --> 01:10:17,379
Well, let's see.

981
01:10:17,454 --> 01:10:20,770
A party like that...

982
01:10:20,846 --> 01:10:22,541
three thousand dollars.

983
01:10:22,588 --> 01:10:26,311
Okay, 3,000. Who has 3,000?

984
01:10:26,381 --> 01:10:28,323
Carlton had 2,800.
He's the closest.

985
01:10:48,045 --> 01:10:50,914
I think it's okay.
What do you think?

986
01:10:51,691 --> 01:10:54,152
What about those little holes?

987
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:56,813
- Are they bite marks?
- No, no, no, n-no, no.

988
01:10:56,852 --> 01:11:01,040
That's... That's how it was.
I'm... I'm pretty sure.

989
01:11:01,071 --> 01:11:02,695
What am I doing?

990
01:11:02,796 --> 01:11:05,130
I can't go to El Paso with this.

991
01:11:05,195 --> 01:11:07,999
Look at it.
It's gonna leak like a sieve.

992
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:11,050
The guy's gonna be alive
for like two minutes and then...

993
01:11:17,835 --> 01:11:21,031
- A drifter.
- A drifter?

994
01:11:21,931 --> 01:11:24,898
We... We find a drifter...

995
01:11:24,971 --> 01:11:27,352
kill him, cut out his heart.

996
01:11:27,407 --> 01:11:29,567
Nobody's gonna miss him, right?
I mean, he's a drifter.

997
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:31,585
He's an invisible man.
It's a perfect plan.

998
01:11:32,111 --> 01:11:34,925
Mr. Zack, now you are
giving me the freak-out.

999
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:38,533
Where...
Where do I find a drifter?

1000
01:11:44,201 --> 01:11:45,411
Enrico.

1001
01:11:46,762 --> 01:11:50,307
- Where did you say you were from?
- Me? I am from Napoli.

1002
01:11:51,657 --> 01:11:54,788
And your family,
they're back there?

1003
01:11:54,857 --> 01:11:58,468
No. No, my papa, he is dead.

1004
01:11:58,716 --> 01:12:02,981
And my mama. All gone.

1005
01:12:03,817 --> 01:12:05,857
Any family? Kids?

1006
01:12:06,278 --> 01:12:07,270
No.

1007
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:08,161
No.

1008
01:12:08,456 --> 01:12:12,285
I am completely alone.

1009
01:12:12,392 --> 01:12:14,661
Why...

1010
01:12:14,728 --> 01:12:17,411
Why do you...

1011
01:12:20,039 --> 01:12:22,756
Look, a drifter. Let's kill him.

1012
01:12:23,158 --> 01:12:25,013
Son of a... Come back here!

1013
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:49,474
Whatever. Listen, sugar.
You're not going anywhere today.

1014
01:12:49,542 --> 01:12:51,102
You got a crack
in your radiator.

1015
01:12:51,174 --> 01:12:53,428
That's this big tank
in front of this big engine.

1016
01:12:53,475 --> 01:12:56,635
- I know what a radiator is.
- Okay, is there a place we can rent a car?

1017
01:12:56,709 --> 01:12:58,913
- Albuquerque.
- Okay, look.

1018
01:12:59,013 --> 01:13:00,668
We'll just have to patch it.
A quick fix.

1019
01:13:00,738 --> 01:13:04,402
- Patch it? Patch it with what?
- Sand and tire sealant.

1020
01:13:04,488 --> 01:13:08,318
You mix the two together. It forms an
adhesive. It should last a couple of hours.

1021
01:13:08,389 --> 01:13:10,243
We only have about
30 miles to go?

1022
01:13:10,309 --> 01:13:13,123
Darlin', we don't have any sand.

1023
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:16,385
Hello! We're in the desert!

1024
01:13:22,116 --> 01:13:24,123
We should've bought a squirrel.

1025
01:13:31,171 --> 01:13:35,165
Mother of mercy!
Where'd you come from? Car trouble?

1026
01:13:35,267 --> 01:13:39,042
Here. Sit down.
You two look exhausted.

1027
01:13:39,107 --> 01:13:41,416
How long y'all been out there?
Here. Have something to drink.

1028
01:13:41,471 --> 01:13:44,205
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
members of the press...</i>

1029
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:48,476
- What's going on?
- A bunch of rocket scientists from L.A....

1030
01:13:48,546 --> 01:13:50,968
they're trying to break
the land speed record.

1031
01:13:53,794 --> 01:13:57,339
...a unique combination of automotive
and aerodynamic innovation.

1032
01:13:57,410 --> 01:13:59,403
The vehicle, which
we call Lightning ll...

1033
01:13:59,426 --> 01:14:01,184
represents three years of R&D...

1034
01:14:01,192 --> 01:14:04,631
which was conducted at the
California Institute of Technology.

1035
01:14:04,705 --> 01:14:09,440
The design team was led by Professor
Ken Freedman and Dr. Richard Kramer.

1036
01:14:09,537 --> 01:14:11,656
We believe
that, aerodynamically...

1037
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:14,554
this is the most perfect
vehicle ever designed.

1038
01:14:14,625 --> 01:14:18,269
The entire vehicle weighs
less than 1,850 pounds.

1039
01:14:18,336 --> 01:14:20,922
The body is a one-piece
Kevlar composite.

1040
01:14:20,993 --> 01:14:23,032
The wheels are
solid billet aluminium...

1041
01:14:23,104 --> 01:14:26,617
and she's powered by twin
JE-79 turbojet engines...

1042
01:14:26,688 --> 01:14:29,241
the same engines that are
in the F-4 Phantom jet.

1043
01:14:29,312 --> 01:14:30,739
Are there any questions?

1044
01:14:30,755 --> 01:14:33,566
Mr. Calvert, what is
the current land speed record?

1045
01:14:33,632 --> 01:14:35,442
That would be
742 miles per hour...

1046
01:14:35,489 --> 01:14:38,068
but we hope to have
a new record today.

1047
01:14:38,176 --> 01:14:41,872
- Anyone else?
- How do you start it?

1048
01:14:42,286 --> 01:14:43,575
Good question.

1049
01:14:43,647 --> 01:14:45,850
There's a green lever to the left of the
steering wheel in the cockpit...

1050
01:14:45,997 --> 01:14:48,965
engages the primary thruster,
igniting the je...

1051
01:15:01,726 --> 01:15:03,581
740, 745...

1052
01:15:03,646 --> 01:15:05,966
- That's a record.
- They're gonna break the sound barrier.

1053
01:15:08,990 --> 01:15:12,186
Well, that's it. I still don't
think she's gonna hold.

1054
01:15:12,253 --> 01:15:15,590
- What do we owe you?
- Five hundred bucks.

1055
01:15:15,629 --> 01:15:18,554
- What?
- For what? For two quarts of sealant?

1056
01:15:18,621 --> 01:15:20,909
No way. That's 20 bucks tops.

1057
01:15:20,964 --> 01:15:24,280
Yeah, okay, here's 40 dollars.
That's double what it's worth, okay?

1058
01:15:24,349 --> 01:15:26,204
Come on, Nick. Let's go.

1059
01:15:27,534 --> 01:15:28,755
Hold it.

1060
01:15:29,557 --> 01:15:30,963
Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on.

1061
01:15:31,004 --> 01:15:33,557
Another little tool
no mechanic should be without.

1062
01:15:35,068 --> 01:15:39,029
Fine. Here's your $500.
But you know what, Billy Ray?

1063
01:15:39,132 --> 01:15:40,653
What goes around, comes around.

1064
01:15:40,684 --> 01:15:42,927
This is so unchristian.

1065
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:44,662
Unchristian?

1066
01:15:45,942 --> 01:15:49,019
Well, if the good Lord don't
like the way I conduct business...

1067
01:15:49,083 --> 01:15:50,567
let him say something.

1068
01:15:50,614 --> 01:15:52,719
Let him give me a sign.

1069
01:15:52,767 --> 01:15:56,509
Oh, Lord, I'm here
and I'm listening!

1070
01:15:56,535 --> 01:15:58,477
Hello!

1071
01:16:03,939 --> 01:16:07,713
- Mach one!
- We did it! We did it!

1072
01:16:13,189 --> 01:16:16,003
Hey, everybody okay?
You all right? Yeah?

1073
01:16:16,046 --> 01:16:19,493
- Randy, you okay?
- There's no Ink Inc.

1074
01:16:19,589 --> 01:16:22,458
- What?
- There's no job. No.

1075
01:16:24,217 --> 01:16:26,389
It's a race. We're racing.

1076
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:28,530
Donald Sinclair put
$2 million in a locker.

1077
01:16:28,601 --> 01:16:30,542
And I wanna get there first.

1078
01:16:30,566 --> 01:16:35,511
I do not want
to work at Home Depot!

1079
01:17:05,207 --> 01:17:07,379
Okay, people, back on the bus.

1080
01:17:07,447 --> 01:17:09,486
George, don't eat that.

1081
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:12,853
Get back on the bus!
Come on. Back on the bus.

1082
01:17:12,919 --> 01:17:14,773
Simon, put that down.

1083
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:18,383
You too. Back on the bus.
Come on, everyone!

1084
01:17:18,487 --> 01:17:21,715
We don't wanna miss dinner.
It's macaroni night!

1085
01:17:25,110 --> 01:17:26,452
We came in the rocket car.

1086
01:17:26,518 --> 01:17:30,795
Oh, a rocket car. Let's hear
all about that on the bus.

1087
01:17:31,166 --> 01:17:32,779
<i>All right,
so we can still win...</i>

1088
01:17:32,853 --> 01:17:35,448
but we have
to leave now, all right?

1089
01:17:35,491 --> 01:17:37,979
- So, come on.
- Dad.

1090
01:17:38,357 --> 01:17:40,462
It's been a living hell.

1091
01:17:40,533 --> 01:17:44,144
Bev, it's... it's $2 million.

1092
01:17:44,213 --> 01:17:47,312
That's a lifetime supply
of hummus.

1093
01:17:54,566 --> 01:17:56,988
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

1094
01:17:57,019 --> 01:18:00,338
I've been selfish. I understand.

1095
01:18:00,404 --> 01:18:03,567
I'm sorry. Really.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1096
01:18:03,636 --> 01:18:07,629
I'm sorry.
I almost got us killed.

1097
01:18:12,019 --> 01:18:13,928
God!

1098
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:24,911
- Hi, everybody. Miss me?
- Hey!

1099
01:18:24,965 --> 01:18:29,013
Listen, just to show there's no hard
feelings, chocolate shakes all around.

1100
01:18:29,067 --> 01:18:31,697
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1101
01:18:31,762 --> 01:18:34,551
I'm a little disappointed,
but I'm an adult.

1102
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:37,082
So drink these up, and then
we'll return the Nazi-mobile.

1103
01:18:37,121 --> 01:18:40,779
We'll get that van fixed, and we'll go back
to Vegas and see David Copperfield!

1104
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:44,679
Yay! Okay, drink up, buddy!

1105
01:18:44,753 --> 01:18:46,411
Is it good?

1106
01:18:46,481 --> 01:18:48,336
Drink it up, honey.

1107
01:18:51,761 --> 01:18:54,015
Oh, don't feel bad.

1108
01:18:54,046 --> 01:18:56,678
- It's not your fault.
- We'll tell the company.

1109
01:18:56,784 --> 01:18:59,086
We won't let them fire you.

1110
01:18:59,152 --> 01:19:01,968
- I'm no bus driver.
- Don't say that.

1111
01:19:01,999 --> 01:19:04,650
No. I'm not.
I'm not a bus driver.

1112
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:07,403
Oh, you mustn't be
so hard on yourself.

1113
01:19:07,472 --> 01:19:10,752
Hey, everybody, who's
the world's greatest bus driver?

1114
01:19:10,784 --> 01:19:13,862
Owen! Owen! Owen! Owen!

1115
01:19:13,878 --> 01:19:15,229
Owen! Owen!

1116
01:19:15,259 --> 01:19:17,268
- No. No. No, no, no, listen.
- Owen! Owen! Owen! Owen!

1117
01:19:17,307 --> 01:19:18,729
Listen, no. Listen. No, no!

1118
01:19:18,799 --> 01:19:22,995
No! No! Shut up, you crazy
Lucy bitches! Shut up!

1119
01:19:24,943 --> 01:19:27,466
I am not a bus driver!

1120
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:31,591
I do not work for
the bus company! All right?

1121
01:19:31,663 --> 01:19:36,070
I needed a ride to New Mexico,
so I stole this uniform!

1122
01:19:36,142 --> 01:19:39,819
See this jacket?
This is not my jacket!

1123
01:19:39,886 --> 01:19:41,773
Remember Marty, the bus driver?

1124
01:19:42,606 --> 01:19:45,835
This is his shirt! I stole it!

1125
01:19:45,902 --> 01:19:48,203
And these pants, you think
I'd wear these pants?

1126
01:19:48,270 --> 01:19:50,604
These aren't my pants!

1127
01:19:50,670 --> 01:19:53,255
These are Marty's pants.
I stole them.

1128
01:19:56,112 --> 01:19:59,408
I am not a bus driver.

1129
01:20:02,061 --> 01:20:04,843
You're not a real bus driver?

1130
01:20:05,139 --> 01:20:06,920
You lied to us!

1131
01:20:06,967 --> 01:20:09,602
He ruined our whole vacation!

1132
01:20:19,276 --> 01:20:22,952
Here they come.
They're all within 50 miles.

1133
01:20:23,019 --> 01:20:25,572
It's the final lap. Mr. Grisham.

1134
01:20:25,643 --> 01:20:28,643
Now, the airport's back on-line, so
I want you to take the Lear jet...

1135
01:20:28,747 --> 01:20:31,846
scoot on down to Silver City
and give us a play-by-play from the finish line.

1136
01:20:31,915 --> 01:20:34,332
Yes, sir.

1137
01:20:34,387 --> 01:20:35,755
Yes!

1138
01:20:57,321 --> 01:20:59,176
Let's go back to Vegas.

1139
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:04,070
Bev, Bev, wake...
Come on. Wake up. Wake up. Bev.

1140
01:21:04,071 --> 01:21:06,856
Bev, wake up. Wake up.
Third Reich's here. Come on. Come on.

1141
01:21:06,921 --> 01:21:08,776
Come on. Get down. You wanna
have a nice life.

1142
01:21:08,841 --> 01:21:12,483
Okay, okay. Think. Think.
SS in the parking lot.

1143
01:21:12,522 --> 01:21:14,376
Not good. Not good. Think.

1144
01:21:17,684 --> 01:21:18,839
Hi, honey.

1145
01:21:19,593 --> 01:21:21,448
- They gonna be all right?
- Yeah.

1146
01:21:21,513 --> 01:21:25,026
Friend, I don't
think there's room.

1147
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,455
This one's little.

1148
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:33,186
- There it is. There it is!
- Silver City. We're almost there.

1149
01:21:33,256 --> 01:21:35,492
Yeah! Go!

1150
01:22:59,971 --> 01:23:01,978
Where the fuck are we?

1151
01:24:05,951 --> 01:24:08,155
There were two guys in there.

1152
01:24:08,223 --> 01:24:10,078
- Where'd they go?
- Hey!

1153
01:24:10,143 --> 01:24:11,670
Thanks for the truck, buddy!

1154
01:25:12,443 --> 01:25:15,068
- Yeah.
<i>- Silver City.</i>

1155
01:25:15,099 --> 01:25:16,626
<i>Next stop, Silver City.</i>

1156
01:25:16,699 --> 01:25:20,048
Silver City?
It is the finish line.

1157
01:25:20,123 --> 01:25:23,221
I made it. I made it!

1158
01:25:25,529 --> 01:25:29,457
The key. Where is the key?

1159
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:35,057
What have we... Where is
the key, my little baby?

1160
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,945
- Excuse me.
- I think I am touching it.

1161
01:25:38,010 --> 01:25:41,807
- Get away from him.
- I can feel it. It's very small.

1162
01:25:42,795 --> 01:25:46,104
<i>- I'm calling the conductor!
- I have it! I got it!</i>

1163
01:25:46,169 --> 01:25:49,300
Wait! Wait!
Come back! Don't leave me!

1164
01:25:54,361 --> 01:25:56,848
Come on! Come on, baby!

1165
01:25:58,488 --> 01:26:00,081
Giddyap!

1166
01:26:04,024 --> 01:26:07,734
Come on, baby.
Just one more mile.

1167
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,134
Just one mile. Come on!

1168
01:26:11,288 --> 01:26:13,142
Randy?

1169
01:26:14,168 --> 01:26:16,240
Hey, honey, how'd you sleep?

1170
01:26:23,863 --> 01:26:26,929
- Pass. Pass him.
- I can't. We're too big.

1171
01:26:26,999 --> 01:26:30,861
There's Silver City.
We're here. Move!

1172
01:26:33,366 --> 01:26:35,221
- They stopped.
- No.

1173
01:26:38,148 --> 01:26:39,740
They're moving. Look.

1174
01:26:49,106 --> 01:26:50,960
Come on, Dad! Let's go!

1175
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:54,348
I can smell it.

1176
01:26:54,421 --> 01:26:58,218

1179
01:27:12,532 --> 01:27:15,434
Hey! Hey!
Stop the bus! Stop the bus!

1180
01:27:15,508 --> 01:27:19,763
- We gotta get off!
- Ladies, ladies, ladies. You know the rules.

1181
01:27:19,828 --> 01:27:21,901
We're not crazy, lady.

1182
01:27:21,972 --> 01:27:23,794
We should've bought a squirrel.
We didn't buy a squirrel.

1183
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:26,380
- Which is why we took the rocket car.
- We can still win.

1184
01:27:26,451 --> 01:27:29,484
If you don't tell that driver to open the door, I'm
gonna crush you like a cockroach in the night.

1185
01:27:29,719 --> 01:27:31,974
Open the door!
Tell him! Tell him!

1186
01:27:32,019 --> 01:27:34,201
- Open the door.
- Thank you!

1187
01:28:01,521 --> 01:28:02,765
It's Pollini.

1188
01:28:02,866 --> 01:28:04,971
Enrico Pollini on a train.

1189
01:28:05,073 --> 01:28:08,968
<i>- He just rolled into the station.</i>
- Well, what do you know?

1190
01:28:09,073 --> 01:28:10,928
Rip Van Winkle pulled it off.

1191
01:28:11,025 --> 01:28:12,999
You gotta love a long shot.

1192
01:28:36,527 --> 01:28:39,374
It's here. It's here.

1193
01:28:39,471 --> 01:28:42,253
- It's here.
- Here he comes.

1194
01:28:42,319 --> 01:28:44,588
- It's you.
- He's holding the key.

1195
01:28:46,575 --> 01:28:48,746
And he's going to the locker.

1196
01:28:50,318 --> 01:28:53,733
Mr. Pollini, well done, sir.
And congratulations.

1197
01:28:53,806 --> 01:28:56,872
On behalf of Mr. Donald Sinclair,
the Venetian Hotel and Casino...

1198
01:29:02,734 --> 01:29:05,669
Mr. Grisham, is it over?

1199
01:29:12,269 --> 01:29:14,124
- Get out of the way!
- Open it!

1200
01:29:21,229 --> 01:29:23,084
He's sleeping.

1201
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:44,234
Did I win?

1202
01:29:45,291 --> 01:29:47,266
Vicky. You let go of this bag...

1203
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:50,918
or I swear... I swear to God, I'll report
you to the escort service.

1204
01:29:50,941 --> 01:29:53,208
Mr. Grisham, what's going on?

1205
01:29:53,291 --> 01:29:56,968
<i>The hooker... The hooker...
The hooker is taking the money.</i>

1206
01:29:57,035 --> 01:30:00,580
- What hooker?
<i>- Vicky. From the hotel.</i>

1207
01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:04,196
- Pepto-Bismol?
<i>- Vicky, I told you to wait in the car.</i>

1208
01:30:04,267 --> 01:30:07,220
- What the hell is she doing there?
<i>- I brought her.</i>

1209
01:30:07,251 --> 01:30:10,087
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Sinclair.
She said she liked me.</i>

1210
01:30:10,151 --> 01:30:13,534
<i>I'm beginning to think she was
only interested in the money!</i>

1211
01:30:18,281 --> 01:30:20,550
- Come with me.
- I'll drive.

1212
01:30:34,217 --> 01:30:37,216
So long, suckers!

1213
01:30:43,304 --> 01:30:46,151
- The bus! The bus.
- You wanna steal a bus?

1214
01:30:46,248 --> 01:30:49,379
- Yes, I do.
- My God, what have I done?

1215
01:30:50,602 --> 01:30:53,090
Help! Somebody help me!

1216
01:30:55,912 --> 01:30:57,767
This thing's got
a mind of its own.

1217
01:31:03,975 --> 01:31:06,342
- Finders keepers, pal.
- That's mine.

1218
01:31:06,641 --> 01:31:08,812
I see it! I see it! Relax!

1219
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:13,165
Oh, no!

1220
01:31:20,998 --> 01:31:23,202
It means it's a scratch.
Nobody wins.

1221
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:26,881
I'll tell you what it means.
It means we're going into extra innings.

1222
01:31:26,949 --> 01:31:29,851
Carla, call the airport. Tell them
to get my other Lear ready.

1223
01:31:29,925 --> 01:31:32,827
Gordon, stay here and keep your eye on
the board. Tell us where they're going.

1224
01:31:32,902 --> 01:31:36,699
Gentlemen, grab your drinks.
We're going to Silver City.

1225
01:31:46,725 --> 01:31:48,579
- Is that it?
- That's it.

1226
01:31:48,645 --> 01:31:50,750
Thank the pilot.
Tell him to level off.

1227
01:31:52,164 --> 01:31:53,855
Who had Mr. Kimiche?

1228
01:31:53,924 --> 01:31:56,132
- It was me.
- Well done!

1229
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:59,009
- Congratulations.
- Very good.

1230
01:32:02,788 --> 01:32:03,681
Keep going!

1231
01:32:05,147 --> 01:32:06,681
Come on!

1232
01:32:06,755 --> 01:32:09,176
There it is.
It's coming down right there.

1233
01:32:24,931 --> 01:32:26,873
- Where is it?
- There it is.

1234
01:32:26,947 --> 01:32:28,670
Go!

1235
01:32:31,586 --> 01:32:34,902
- Get it! Get it!
- Grab that money!

1236
01:32:35,251 --> 01:32:36,688
Get it down!

1237
01:32:54,017 --> 01:32:56,221
Now, that is
one hell of an entrance.

1238
01:32:56,289 --> 01:32:58,045
It's Smash Mouth!

1239
01:32:59,073 --> 01:33:01,723
What's going on over here?

1240
01:33:02,182 --> 01:33:03,726
- What's this?
- Money.

1241
01:33:03,808 --> 01:33:05,880
Jesus, how much is this?

1242
01:33:05,952 --> 01:33:08,123
- Two million dollars.
- Two...

1243
01:33:08,192 --> 01:33:12,053
Two million...
Two million dollars, everybody!

1244
01:33:14,555 --> 01:33:16,904
We got two million dollars!

1245
01:33:16,936 --> 01:33:19,422
On the bus,
we talked about it...

1246
01:33:19,463 --> 01:33:23,173
and we decide
to share all the money.

1247
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:26,198
They're gonna share
all the money, everybody!

1248
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:28,948
Oh, man!

1249
01:33:29,951 --> 01:33:31,957
Get these guys some jackets.

1250
01:33:32,035 --> 01:33:34,369
Get these jack...
Get these jackets over here.

1251
01:33:36,253 --> 01:33:38,956
So what's the story, man? Are you
guys some kind of organization?

1252
01:33:39,003 --> 01:33:42,743
- What's going on?
- No, no. We just met this morning.

1253
01:33:42,797 --> 01:33:45,309
They just met
this morning, everybody!

1254
01:33:45,374 --> 01:33:46,581
Oh, my God!

1255
01:33:46,597 --> 01:33:49,785
I almost didn't come along,
but then I met Tracy and...

1256
01:33:49,854 --> 01:33:52,011
Well, great things
happen all at once.

1257
01:33:52,057 --> 01:33:55,373
Oh, this is beautiful, baby.
This is beautiful.

1258
01:33:55,590 --> 01:33:57,794
Great things happen,
I don't know.

1259
01:33:59,097 --> 01:34:00,612
Feed the earth, baby.
Feed the earth.

1260
01:34:00,641 --> 01:34:04,362
We're gonna go ahead and check the tote board
now and see where we're at. Okay?

1261
01:34:04,413 --> 01:34:07,762
Come on, baby.
Let it roll. Come on, baby.

1262
01:34:17,052 --> 01:34:18,362
You don't understand.

1263
01:34:23,850 --> 01:34:27,748
Excuse me.
We work for Feed the Earth.

1264
01:34:27,819 --> 01:34:29,783
These are some of our children.

1265
01:34:34,779 --> 01:34:38,456
I don't know who you people are
or where you came from...

1266
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:41,982
but God bless you.

1267
01:34:43,738 --> 01:34:44,632
Tonight...

1268
01:34:45,010 --> 01:34:47,465
you've given to these kids...

1269
01:34:47,526 --> 01:34:51,948
and their brothers and sisters
all over the world more than money.

1270
01:34:51,994 --> 01:34:54,901
You've given them back
their faith...

1271
01:34:54,970 --> 01:34:58,231
their faith
in the goodness of people.

1272
01:35:05,498 --> 01:35:10,483
She said, "You are just
like the 12 disciples."

1273
01:35:12,089 --> 01:35:13,615
Aw!

1274
01:35:16,888 --> 01:35:18,001
Aw!

1275
01:35:19,689 --> 01:35:20,977
Thank you.

1276
01:36:07,410 --> 01:36:08,672
Forget it.

1277
01:36:08,917 --> 01:36:11,637
Look, all these other disciples can do
whatever they want with their share.

1278
01:36:11,670 --> 01:36:13,709
- But this money's going home with us.
- What?

1279
01:36:13,781 --> 01:36:18,104
- Period. End of story.
- Put the money in the bag, carrot.

1280
01:36:21,301 --> 01:36:24,170
You don't know me, man.

1281
01:36:24,276 --> 01:36:26,131
Come here.

1282
01:36:28,405 --> 01:36:30,259
It's you.

1283
01:36:32,212 --> 01:36:34,284
I'm so proud of you.

1284
01:36:34,356 --> 01:36:37,258
Giving away all of your money?

1285
01:36:48,339 --> 01:36:49,681
Come on.

1286
01:36:53,144 --> 01:36:54,917
No. No. No!

1287
01:36:58,067 --> 01:37:01,166
Mama is watching us
from heaven right now.

1288
01:37:03,696 --> 01:37:05,638
What would she do?

1289
01:37:09,202 --> 01:37:12,747
It's for starving children, Duane.

1290
01:37:15,186 --> 01:37:16,720
Do it for Mom.

1291
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:42,760
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

1292
01:37:42,833 --> 01:37:45,134
I'd like to introduce
the real star of tonight's show.

1293
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:48,942
I can honestly say that none of us would
be here tonight if it wasn't for this man.

1294
01:37:49,008 --> 01:37:52,303
He is the man with the plan,
Mr. Donald Sinclair.

1295
01:37:53,328 --> 01:37:53,843
What?

1296
01:37:53,874 --> 01:37:56,938
One of the wealthiest
men in the world!

1297
01:37:58,023 --> 01:38:01,422
- Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Donald Sinclair!
- You are the man.

1298
01:38:01,519 --> 01:38:04,902
Get a camera on him. There you go.
Nice shot. There he is.

1299
01:38:06,287 --> 01:38:09,385
These men, they didn't
have to be here tonight.

1300
01:38:09,455 --> 01:38:11,789
No, they could be off
kicking back in the Riviera...

1301
01:38:11,854 --> 01:38:15,203
or in Vegas blowing their money
on some meaningless idiotic bet.

1302
01:38:17,232 --> 01:38:18,828
They couldn't do that...

1303
01:38:18,894 --> 01:38:21,849
not when there were children
going to bed hungry every night.

1304
01:38:21,998 --> 01:38:24,341
Isn't that right, fellas?
Isn't that right?

1305
01:38:24,381 --> 01:38:25,997
Whatever.

1306
01:38:26,062 --> 01:38:28,582
Mr. Donald Sinclair
and his partners...

1307
01:38:28,654 --> 01:38:31,720
want you and the millions
of people watching at home...

1308
01:38:31,822 --> 01:38:35,131
to know they plan to match
whatever you raise tonight...

1309
01:38:35,139 --> 01:38:36,642
dollar for dollar!

1310
01:38:36,749 --> 01:38:38,407
- Dollar for dollar!
- Dollar for dollar!

1311
01:38:41,613 --> 01:38:43,206
A matching fund, everybody!

1312
01:38:43,277 --> 01:38:45,611
Let's hit the phones
out there and crank it up...

1313
01:38:45,677 --> 01:38:48,360
because we're gonna feed
the whole world tonight!
