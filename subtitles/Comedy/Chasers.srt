1
00:01:43,246 --> 00:01:46,079
Hey! What the hell's
going on here?

2
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:49,308
Today's a big flag day.
It's the Fourth of July.

3
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:54,889
Yeah! Yeah!

4
00:01:55,124 --> 00:01:57,718
Fourth of July! Discharged!

5
00:01:58,962 --> 00:02:00,156
I'm out of here!

6
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,458
Discharge!

7
00:02:08,004 --> 00:02:10,802
All right, I'm out of here!
One more day!

8
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:13,802
Discharge! So long, suckers!

9
00:03:24,814 --> 00:03:26,008
Stig speaking.

10
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:27,375
It's Mr. Devane.

11
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,983
Oh, yes, sir.
I've been expecting your call.

12
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,585
You're working on the 4th?

13
00:03:32,822 --> 00:03:35,689
- I'm gonna be working late.
- How's my baby?

14
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:37,688
I'm looking right at it.

15
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:39,891
She's completely loaded.

16
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:42,620
Everything you want.
It's got a phone in there.

17
00:03:42,865 --> 00:03:44,389
The Riccaro buckets.

18
00:03:44,634 --> 00:03:46,192
Everything you wanted.
Loaded.

19
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:48,961
But when you phone in your order...

20
00:03:49,205 --> 00:03:52,231
...and wire in cash, you're one
of our preferred customers.

21
00:03:52,475 --> 00:03:56,411
I'll be in tonight. You'll recognize
me by the smile on my face.

22
00:03:56,646 --> 00:03:57,943
Right.

23
00:04:14,097 --> 00:04:16,065
- Morning, sweetheart.
- How you doing?

24
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:21,067
Morning, sexy.

25
00:04:24,507 --> 00:04:26,839
- Good morning.
- Morning.

26
00:04:33,282 --> 00:04:37,275
- How did you remember my birthday?
- How could I forget, gorgeous?

27
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,817
You are so sweet.

28
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:43,352
Same day as the frigging country.

29
00:04:49,532 --> 00:04:51,966
Processing, section 7, Finster here.

30
00:04:52,201 --> 00:04:55,136
- Hello?
- Howard. Storage room.

31
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,038
Howard?

32
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,100
Howard?

33
00:05:03,546 --> 00:05:05,138
Storage room, five minutes.

34
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:06,712
No.

35
00:05:07,049 --> 00:05:08,710
- Howard?
- No, no.

36
00:05:08,985 --> 00:05:12,443
Howard, you listen to me.
Get your ass in that storage room.

37
00:05:12,722 --> 00:05:15,589
No! No, no, no.

38
00:05:23,766 --> 00:05:25,063
Howard?

39
00:05:28,971 --> 00:05:31,963
The guy's a designer.
He works out of a loft in L.A.

40
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,608
He calls me, I tell him
what I can get, and boom!

41
00:05:34,844 --> 00:05:36,971
He wants 1000 dress-white
bell-bottoms.

42
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:39,181
1000, Howard.
Now, Howard...

43
00:05:39,615 --> 00:05:42,880
...I got him to 12 bucks a pair.
That's 12 grand COD.

44
00:05:43,453 --> 00:05:46,479
I can't believe you're trying
to pull something like this...

45
00:05:46,756 --> 00:05:49,554
...on the last day before discharge.
No!

46
00:05:56,132 --> 00:05:58,498
Howard, my hand to God...

47
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,429
...this is the last, final one.

48
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:04,606
The last one was the last and
final one, and the time before that...

49
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:06,968
...was the last and final one.

50
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,440
I'm getting hives again.

51
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:15,845
I thought you'd be thanking me.
I'm talking an extra six grand each.

52
00:06:16,452 --> 00:06:19,615
This much inventory has to be
split into separate lots...

53
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:24,555
...each with its own manifest, each
with its own point of entry. No!

54
00:06:27,063 --> 00:06:29,054
I didn't realize it'd be
such a problem.

55
00:06:29,332 --> 00:06:33,029
I never would've transferred
a consignment and re-routed a truck.

56
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,863
These are the invoice numbers.

57
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:38,468
Take them.

58
00:06:38,741 --> 00:06:43,474
I mean, if you don't make it disappear,
we could be in some serious shit.

59
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:48,543
I've gotta get on this immediately.

60
00:06:49,185 --> 00:06:50,743
Come here and give me a hug.

61
00:06:55,658 --> 00:06:58,923
That's it, pal. Good, good.

62
00:06:59,362 --> 00:07:00,488
All right.

63
00:07:07,837 --> 00:07:09,828
- How about lunch later?
- Hey, Eddie.

64
00:07:10,072 --> 00:07:13,439
Master Chief wants to see you ASAP.

65
00:07:13,676 --> 00:07:15,644
You just can't stop, can you?

66
00:07:15,912 --> 00:07:17,709
If I did, you wouldn't love me.

67
00:07:35,298 --> 00:07:36,265
Come in.

68
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,924
You asked for me?

69
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:41,928
Yes, I did.

70
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,332
I won't hoist half-sails with you.

71
00:07:44,574 --> 00:07:46,769
Those SPs outside...

72
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,533
...they're here for you.

73
00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:54,610
Due to the holiday...

74
00:07:54,884 --> 00:07:58,445
...the N.A. Is short of bodies.
So your name came up.

75
00:07:59,388 --> 00:08:00,320
N.A., chief?

76
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,392
Naval Apprehension, son.

77
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:07,925
They got a prisoner brigged
at Camp Lejeune Weapons Center.

78
00:08:08,164 --> 00:08:12,294
Gotta transfer him back here to
Charleston, and that someone is you.

79
00:08:13,336 --> 00:08:15,304
They need somebody for chaser duty.

80
00:08:15,605 --> 00:08:16,799
Chaser duty.

81
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,202
The trouble with youth is
that they shirk their duty.

82
00:08:22,144 --> 00:08:25,136
No, no. Never behind the desk.

83
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:28,145
Your name was on the computer
because you're unassigned.

84
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:30,476
That means you don't have new orders.

85
00:08:31,354 --> 00:08:33,481
No, but I'm discharged tomorrow.

86
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:36,456
Yeah, well, your availability...

87
00:08:36,826 --> 00:08:40,227
...combined with your experience
at base security...

88
00:08:40,463 --> 00:08:43,159
...got you this detail.
You should be proud of it.

89
00:08:45,668 --> 00:08:47,636
Begging your pardon, chief.

90
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,868
A colleague in personnel can
cancel this obvious mistake.

91
00:08:51,107 --> 00:08:54,543
Forget about that. Orders are orders,
and you're in the Navy.

92
00:08:54,777 --> 00:08:57,769
But chief, it's my last day.

93
00:08:58,014 --> 00:08:59,208
I had plans.

94
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:01,507
Change them. Dismissed.

95
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,954
One last time.

96
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,555
Very last time.

97
00:09:14,664 --> 00:09:17,497
That guy could sell a freezer
to an Eskimo.

98
00:09:21,037 --> 00:09:24,404
That gay thing, man. Congress is
full of black, gay sympathizers.

99
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,335
Oh, wow.

100
00:09:28,077 --> 00:09:29,942
Destroy the evidence.

101
00:09:30,312 --> 00:09:32,507
They'll go to Eddie's desk first.

102
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:35,344
I love you, Mom.

103
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:37,609
I love you, Dad.

104
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,818
- Hi, Howard.
- Hello.

105
00:09:46,062 --> 00:09:47,723
- How are you?
- Good.

106
00:09:55,571 --> 00:09:58,472
I need to make a call.
Can you stop at that phone booth?

107
00:10:01,677 --> 00:10:03,508
Thank you, I appreciate it.

108
00:10:03,746 --> 00:10:05,373
Fucking redneck.

109
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,309
What'd you say?

110
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:12,645
Nothing. I was just thinking
how sad it is when cousins marry.

111
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:02,267
My friend.

112
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,227
Yo, Rock. What's the hap?

113
00:11:29,598 --> 00:11:31,088
Scuttlebutt is...

114
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,197
...your last partner busted himself up
chasing some brother.

115
00:11:35,437 --> 00:11:37,769
Should've shot that motherfucker.

116
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:41,374
Why you still driving this piece
of shit? We just got a new rig.

117
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,569
We're ready to break her in. We're
gonna kick some asses this morning.

118
00:11:48,651 --> 00:11:51,677
Bunch of Marieletos holding people up
down near Patriots Point.

119
00:11:51,954 --> 00:11:55,754
We figure they'll hit today.
Reason being, everyone's celebrating.

120
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:58,186
We're gonna fuck us up some beaners.

121
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,135
Hi, chief, how you doing?
Is there a pay phone around?

122
00:12:08,404 --> 00:12:10,133
Introduce Rock to his new partner.

123
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:12,431
What'd you say your name was, sis?

124
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,703
How could you confuse me
with your sis?

125
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,739
Her dick's much bigger than mine.

126
00:12:21,884 --> 00:12:23,317
Shit! Goddamn!

127
00:12:23,552 --> 00:12:26,146
- Goddamn, man! He ducked!
- What the fuck?!

128
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:38,827
About that phone...

129
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:43,662
It could wait.

130
00:12:51,247 --> 00:12:52,509
Wear it.

131
00:12:59,188 --> 00:13:00,120
Sign for it.

132
00:13:09,398 --> 00:13:10,558
Wear it.

133
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:19,767
Does it have a name?

134
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:23,945
Eddie Devane. Of course,
you can call me Ed or Edward.

135
00:13:24,446 --> 00:13:27,609
How about I just call you asshole,
and you answer to it?

136
00:13:27,883 --> 00:13:29,441
That'd be a first.

137
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:31,485
Listen up, asshole.

138
00:13:31,754 --> 00:13:36,316
You're here because the Navy requires
two people to transport a prisoner.

139
00:13:36,558 --> 00:13:40,392
I don't need you, I don't want you,
and I don't want to repeat myself.

140
00:13:40,896 --> 00:13:42,454
I've had hundreds of partners.

141
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:45,166
The smart ones stay out of my way.

142
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:46,891
The ones who don't...

143
00:13:47,803 --> 00:13:49,964
...come back worse off than
the prisoners.

144
00:13:53,976 --> 00:13:55,273
You fuck with me...

145
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:58,571
...I will make this trip the longest
six hours of your life.

146
00:13:58,814 --> 00:14:00,645
Now, get in the van!

147
00:14:30,446 --> 00:14:32,038
This thing go any faster?

148
00:14:33,782 --> 00:14:36,774
There's a guy running alongside
asking for a ride.

149
00:14:40,356 --> 00:14:42,153
I got things to do tonight.

150
00:14:42,891 --> 00:14:44,518
I get out tomorrow, you know?

151
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:48,726
It's cool. Discharge is honorable.

152
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:50,790
That's hard to believe.

153
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:52,193
Why's that?

154
00:14:52,668 --> 00:14:55,899
Let's just say I've been
doing this job for a while.

155
00:14:58,107 --> 00:14:59,438
Meaning what?

156
00:14:59,675 --> 00:15:02,075
I could see you from
a mile away, slick.

157
00:15:02,311 --> 00:15:05,007
That tailored uniform, a wad of bills
in your pocket...

158
00:15:05,247 --> 00:15:08,080
...you look like the poster boy
for petty crime.

159
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:10,746
Maybe not even so petty.

160
00:15:15,424 --> 00:15:16,914
Leave it alone, it's broken.

161
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:34,541
Two bacon chilidogs, large fries
and a large root beer.

162
00:15:35,778 --> 00:15:36,676
Hey, buddy.

163
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,948
That won't do you no good.
It's broken.

164
00:15:41,216 --> 00:15:42,649
I'll take your order.

165
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,956
Well, two bacon chilidogs,
a large fries and a large root beer.

166
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,884
We got no bacon chilidogs.

167
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:52,686
- Since when?
- Since I've worked here.

168
00:15:54,396 --> 00:15:58,423
Wait, I've been here at least
50 times. I always have those dogs.

169
00:15:58,667 --> 00:15:59,725
So what?

170
00:16:00,035 --> 00:16:03,027
- I'll have a Flying Pig burger.
- I'm not finished.

171
00:16:03,272 --> 00:16:05,069
Just giving you time to look.

172
00:16:06,475 --> 00:16:07,942
Come on, pop. What'll it be?

173
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:09,508
Pop?

174
00:16:09,745 --> 00:16:12,373
Listen up, we can always go
somewhere else to eat.

175
00:16:12,614 --> 00:16:14,639
What? Oh, no.

176
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:16,885
You'd take your business elsewhere?

177
00:16:18,787 --> 00:16:21,415
Hey, you know what?
Beat it!

178
00:16:21,657 --> 00:16:24,558
- What?!
- Go fuck yourself!

179
00:16:28,063 --> 00:16:30,463
I'm gonna kill you, you fucking pig!

180
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:36,163
Oh, great. Next food, 68 miles.

181
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:37,429
Pop!

182
00:16:37,673 --> 00:16:40,335
I should've popped him,
that civilian weenie.

183
00:16:40,576 --> 00:16:41,702
How old are you?

184
00:16:42,144 --> 00:16:43,873
That's not the point.

185
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:48,809
The point is, he had no manners.
That's what's wrong with this country.

186
00:16:49,852 --> 00:16:51,683
You're just not good with people.

187
00:16:52,621 --> 00:16:54,054
You're pushing it.

188
00:16:54,423 --> 00:16:56,414
You're great when
they're wearing cuffs.

189
00:16:56,692 --> 00:17:00,321
Otherwise you got as much charm as
a bulldozer. I'll give you advice...

190
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,928
I gave you some when we started
this detail.

191
00:17:03,165 --> 00:17:06,100
Don't hit people head-on. If you
want something, try the back door.

192
00:17:06,335 --> 00:17:09,327
- That's usually open.
- Like your mouth.

193
00:17:32,161 --> 00:17:33,287
Go on.

194
00:17:33,562 --> 00:17:35,553
Ollie North's a fag!

195
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:40,794
Welcome to Jarhead City.
Look at them.

196
00:17:41,036 --> 00:17:42,936
Why do we despise jarheads so much?

197
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:44,439
Why?!

198
00:17:44,673 --> 00:17:48,871
Yeah, like it's a given:
Marine equals dogshit. How come?

199
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:51,136
Because they're assholes!

200
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,348
Yeah, right. I forgot.

201
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:05,618
They don't know what they're
coming into.

202
00:18:05,861 --> 00:18:09,797
Those little fish heads.
The little fish boys.

203
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,473
That ain't a toy. Holster it.

204
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,383
Think of that as decorative.

205
00:18:33,622 --> 00:18:35,055
Don't touch the thing.

206
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,487
The shit hits the fan,
I'll be the one who drops him.

207
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:43,188
Now, remember,
four-fifths of this job is attitude.

208
00:18:43,432 --> 00:18:46,128
If you're tough,
they won't fuck with you.

209
00:18:46,735 --> 00:18:49,260
From now on, you're mean.

210
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,508
God help us.

211
00:19:15,464 --> 00:19:16,431
Here they come.

212
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:18,327
Here they are.

213
00:19:25,907 --> 00:19:27,101
Go ahead.

214
00:19:29,478 --> 00:19:31,946
The fun is about to begin, boys.

215
00:19:35,317 --> 00:19:36,443
Hey, Banger!

216
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,151
Douche bag!

217
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,980
Oh, Rock!
Rock, Rock, Rock.

218
00:19:42,257 --> 00:19:44,020
- Got a new partner there.
- Yeah.

219
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:47,593
- Real pretty boy.
- Are we gonna wait here all day?

220
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:50,297
That all depends, sir.
What are you here for?

221
00:19:50,532 --> 00:19:53,558
One seaman, second class,
Tony Johnson.

222
00:19:53,802 --> 00:19:56,362
Tony Johnson? Give me that thing.

223
00:19:57,873 --> 00:19:59,204
Can't this be done out there?

224
00:20:00,676 --> 00:20:02,906
Gotta make sure everything's in order.

225
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:06,670
They just sent two of you
for this prisoner?

226
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:10,908
No. There's some cheese-dick
like you hiding behind us.

227
00:20:11,186 --> 00:20:13,017
I gotta get out.

228
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:16,019
You don't like tight spots?
You should use some Vaseline.

229
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:18,818
Are you sure you don't have
somebody else?

230
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:20,928
Come on!

231
00:20:23,332 --> 00:20:24,799
You Navy boys are too slick.

232
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:27,194
One prisoner coming up.

233
00:20:28,704 --> 00:20:30,934
- Welcome to the house of gravity.
- Jesus!

234
00:20:34,643 --> 00:20:36,008
Navy! Navy!

235
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,643
Navy, slicker than ink.

236
00:20:39,715 --> 00:20:41,080
Okay.

237
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,116
Make it snappy.
We got a long haul.

238
00:20:44,353 --> 00:20:47,754
Johnson's 7 to 10. I gotta
make sure I dot all the I's.

239
00:20:48,023 --> 00:20:49,820
All right. I'm going to the head.

240
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,785
Strike some matches.

241
00:20:52,027 --> 00:20:53,892
Anchors aweigh, jarheads.

242
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,660
You guys, take your positions.

243
00:21:03,872 --> 00:21:06,568
Someone's having a bad dream.
That's all that is.

244
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:09,671
Sign this.

245
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,543
- What is it?
- It's routine, to get the prisoner.

246
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,078
You'll be on your way.

247
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:17,645
Bring up Johnson!

248
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:18,908
Yes, sir!

249
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:22,953
Hey, sarge!
Got stuff written on the walls here!

250
00:21:23,258 --> 00:21:24,156
What is it?

251
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:26,519
"Banger bangs his mother"!

252
00:21:26,762 --> 00:21:29,128
"Banger's a bad bitch"!

253
00:21:29,364 --> 00:21:30,661
All kinds of stuff!

254
00:21:30,899 --> 00:21:33,129
Smell the seat.
Smell the seat, Rock!

255
00:21:33,368 --> 00:21:36,360
Play with the toilet fish.
That's where you belong.

256
00:21:37,572 --> 00:21:39,005
You guys in the Navy.

257
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,111
I'm not a big fan of the Navy.

258
00:21:49,718 --> 00:21:51,242
I never have been.

259
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:54,955
I don't like the way it smells.

260
00:21:55,223 --> 00:21:57,555
But they did right sending you here.

261
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:00,125
You got the right kind of tool
for this job.

262
00:22:01,163 --> 00:22:02,596
Yes, sir.

263
00:22:03,298 --> 00:22:06,563
You're one hellacious piece
of manpower.

264
00:22:06,802 --> 00:22:07,860
Move it.

265
00:22:10,105 --> 00:22:12,130
What are you on about now?

266
00:22:12,607 --> 00:22:14,802
What I want to know is
which one of you...

267
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:17,307
...will be the female escort
on this show?

268
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,038
About face.

269
00:22:30,992 --> 00:22:33,517
- What is this shit?
- You know the rules.

270
00:22:33,762 --> 00:22:37,220
Any female prisoner in transport
must have a female escort.

271
00:22:37,466 --> 00:22:39,934
We're here to pick up a guy.
Tony Johnson.

272
00:22:40,168 --> 00:22:43,660
I know who you're here to get.
Charleston doesn't know shit.

273
00:22:44,673 --> 00:22:47,904
This is the N.I.S. Report.
This is the correct spelling.

274
00:22:48,143 --> 00:22:50,373
The Navy orders are wrong again.

275
00:22:50,645 --> 00:22:52,374
T-O-N-I.

276
00:22:52,614 --> 00:22:54,206
Like the permanent.

277
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:55,607
She's female.

278
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,821
Joke's over. Take her back.

279
00:23:02,057 --> 00:23:03,490
No. I can't.

280
00:23:03,725 --> 00:23:05,488
We ain't taking her!

281
00:23:05,727 --> 00:23:09,356
Pretty boy already signed for her.
She's yours.

282
00:23:13,168 --> 00:23:14,192
Forget the rules.

283
00:23:14,636 --> 00:23:16,263
I'll find a dress for you.

284
00:23:16,505 --> 00:23:18,132
- He said it was routine.
- You...

285
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:21,365
Crotchless panties.
A 44 double-D bra.

286
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,737
- I thought...
- Who told you to think?!

287
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:28,082
Take your marital spat outside.
This is my office.

288
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,011
It's a clean place!

289
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:32,411
Get my leg irons off her.

290
00:23:32,687 --> 00:23:34,621
He's her problem now.

291
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:37,387
Good luck.

292
00:23:48,436 --> 00:23:50,802
- What?
- The sun. I haven't been out lately.

293
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,506
I have shades in the van.

294
00:23:52,741 --> 00:23:54,936
Get back here and secure the prisoner!

295
00:23:55,176 --> 00:23:58,543
- Just getting her some glasses.
- Knock that shit off! Get below.

296
00:24:17,232 --> 00:24:18,563
The seat's hot.

297
00:24:19,634 --> 00:24:22,159
- I'll get you a towel.
- Okay.

298
00:24:24,739 --> 00:24:26,138
Those are mine.

299
00:24:28,076 --> 00:24:29,304
Get in the van!

300
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:36,976
Why not make her a pitcher
of iced tea while we're at it?

301
00:24:37,252 --> 00:24:39,743
I don't want to cause
any more trouble.

302
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:41,655
You're right. Get in.

303
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,496
You stow it.

304
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,772
She have to be cuffed back there?

305
00:25:08,249 --> 00:25:10,649
She can't get out of the cage.

306
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:13,753
You okay?

307
00:25:14,022 --> 00:25:14,920
Turn around!

308
00:25:15,924 --> 00:25:16,720
Just asking.

309
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:20,450
Regulations prohibit engaging
a prisoner in a conversation.

310
00:25:22,097 --> 00:25:24,031
Regulations are regulations.

311
00:25:29,504 --> 00:25:33,201
That guy back there said 7 to 10.
He mean years?

312
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,211
Is this her report right here?

313
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:47,085
What'd she do?

314
00:25:48,123 --> 00:25:51,024
What do I care?
I never read them.

315
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:54,386
Seven to ten's a long time.
Aren't you even curious?

316
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,228
No.

317
00:26:05,173 --> 00:26:06,663
I have asthma.

318
00:26:10,178 --> 00:26:11,611
Jesus!

319
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:24,523
Excuse me.

320
00:26:27,062 --> 00:26:29,553
If I may, I have to use
the bathroom.

321
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:31,595
Sure, we can pull off up here.

322
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:33,460
She can go when we stop for gas.

323
00:26:33,702 --> 00:26:35,067
She has to go, she has to go.

324
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:37,100
She should've gone at the camp.

325
00:26:37,338 --> 00:26:38,464
I have to go too.

326
00:26:38,707 --> 00:26:41,198
We haven't eaten yet.
Looks like our last chance.

327
00:26:41,443 --> 00:26:43,172
All right. All right.

328
00:27:00,462 --> 00:27:04,262
- Operator.
- Charleston, 722-1599.

329
00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:06,195
Please hold.

330
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:12,436
- I thought you had the urge to go.
- Well, I lost the urge.

331
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:27,220
Thanks for stopping.

332
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,221
You're welcome.

333
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,025
I owe you one.

334
00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:35,828
No, you don't.

335
00:27:36,164 --> 00:27:38,496
Are you sure there's nothing
you'd like?

336
00:27:42,003 --> 00:27:45,063
There's a lot I'd like, missy,
but nothing I can afford.

337
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,137
Excuse me.

338
00:28:01,523 --> 00:28:04,321
He ain't worth the salt
in your tears, Sue Ann.

339
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:07,759
Goes and sleeps with your sister.

340
00:28:09,097 --> 00:28:10,394
He's trash!

341
00:28:10,632 --> 00:28:13,567
- He is worse than trash!
- Jesus.

342
00:28:13,802 --> 00:28:15,667
Hey, that door stays unlocked.

343
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:16,928
Sure thing, sugar.

344
00:28:17,172 --> 00:28:19,834
I'd keep the ring and slash his tires.

345
00:28:26,047 --> 00:28:27,674
Is this stall taken?

346
00:28:31,986 --> 00:28:35,319
Oh, honey, I died when I seen
his shoes under the door.

347
00:28:35,957 --> 00:28:37,857
I nearly forgot my lines.

348
00:28:41,863 --> 00:28:43,194
Thank God.

349
00:28:44,966 --> 00:28:46,228
You're so late.

350
00:28:46,467 --> 00:28:50,528
- I thought you wouldn't show.
- I didn't have an exact timetable.

351
00:28:51,406 --> 00:28:54,136
- Are you sure about this, doll?
- Do it.

352
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:28,668
Hey, cutie-pie.

353
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,400
You got a smoke?

354
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:31,767
Oh, yeah.

355
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:37,747
Is that a verification
of that number?

356
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,397
Thank you.

357
00:29:50,632 --> 00:29:51,860
Sure thing.

358
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,344
You ought to get fries to
go with that shake!

359
00:31:11,646 --> 00:31:13,341
She's gone!

360
00:31:29,163 --> 00:31:29,959
There!

361
00:31:33,001 --> 00:31:34,866
Hold it right there!

362
00:31:36,504 --> 00:31:38,802
Help! They're trying to kill me!

363
00:31:42,043 --> 00:31:43,237
All right, let's go.

364
00:31:43,478 --> 00:31:44,536
Let her go!

365
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:46,441
Get lost, tiny!

366
00:31:52,353 --> 00:31:53,820
All right, hold it!

367
00:31:57,158 --> 00:32:00,150
You are aiding and abetting
an escaped felon.

368
00:32:01,662 --> 00:32:04,927
You let her go or I'm gonna shoot you
in your big, fat gut!

369
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,966
Goddamn it, that pisses me off.

370
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:51,077
I've transported 862 prisoners and
I've never had one get away from me.

371
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:54,781
- Calm down, you got her back.
- That's not the point.

372
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:58,507
- I'll look like an idiot reporting it.
- So don't report it.

373
00:33:01,255 --> 00:33:03,052
I figured you'd say that.

374
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:06,052
Mr. " Let's Uncuff Her
And Bake Her A Cake."

375
00:33:06,294 --> 00:33:08,421
- Who gave her a cigarette?
- Who opened the door?

376
00:33:08,663 --> 00:33:10,893
- Who's in charge?
- Button it, mister!

377
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:16,462
I hope you know that stunt of yours
cost you another five years.

378
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:18,865
What do you think about that?

379
00:33:19,107 --> 00:33:20,540
I think I'm in my moon.

380
00:33:20,775 --> 00:33:21,901
What?

381
00:33:22,143 --> 00:33:24,373
- My lady's.
- What'd she say?

382
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:26,870
I'm starting my cycle.

383
00:33:28,449 --> 00:33:30,417
She's starting her period.

384
00:33:35,623 --> 00:33:38,057
Well, go ahead and start.

385
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,892
If you think I'd fall for that,
you ain't as smart as I thought.

386
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:46,191
There ain't nothing you can do
that'll get me to let you out again.

387
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:50,359
Not if the van caught fire.
Not if you peed in your pants.

388
00:33:50,605 --> 00:33:54,268
Not if a rattler sat in your lap
and you screamed all the way back.

389
00:33:54,509 --> 00:33:57,945
The desert will turn green before I
let you out of there again.

390
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:15,656
Will that be all?

391
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,501
Go on. Get in there.

392
00:35:05,913 --> 00:35:08,438
Never done this handcuffed
to a man before.

393
00:35:10,618 --> 00:35:12,381
Kind of sexy, don't you think?

394
00:35:34,575 --> 00:35:35,633
There.

395
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:38,639
All done.

396
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:43,312
Here. Help stop the bleeding.

397
00:35:43,651 --> 00:35:44,811
Let's go!

398
00:36:03,437 --> 00:36:04,404
Hey, gorgeous.

399
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:12,509
Jesus!

400
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:14,703
You stupid!

401
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:26,420
Son of a bitch!

402
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,798
You did that on purpose.
You kicked that hose out.

403
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,167
You're the one dragging me
in handcuffs.

404
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:43,309
- Chill, Rock.
- Chill?!

405
00:36:43,678 --> 00:36:45,077
I'll put you on ice.

406
00:36:45,313 --> 00:36:49,181
Regulations, Rock.
Hitting your partner's against them.

407
00:36:54,221 --> 00:36:55,745
Put her in the van and lock it.

408
00:36:56,557 --> 00:37:00,220
I'm gonna pay and go to
the head to wash this shit out.

409
00:37:16,877 --> 00:37:19,539
- My name's Eddie Devane.
- Toni Johnson.

410
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,441
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Likewise.

411
00:37:26,587 --> 00:37:29,317
Would you hand me
a paper towel, please?

412
00:37:34,829 --> 00:37:37,593
You're not gonna make
some kind of weapon, are you?

413
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:40,130
You're cute.

414
00:37:51,145 --> 00:37:53,010
I told you to secure the prisoner.

415
00:37:53,247 --> 00:37:54,544
Sorry, chief.

416
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,753
Close the door.

417
00:38:13,067 --> 00:38:15,831
We're shoving off. Get in the van.

418
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:39,424
So, chief.
What's your wife's name?

419
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:41,191
What?

420
00:38:41,729 --> 00:38:43,356
Your wife. Her name?

421
00:38:44,632 --> 00:38:45,997
None of your business.

422
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:49,597
- You're married?
- None of your business either.

423
00:38:50,805 --> 00:38:52,898
I just have trouble picturing it.

424
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,573
What is she, a marine?

425
00:38:55,976 --> 00:38:57,944
Glad you got a sense of humor.

426
00:38:58,179 --> 00:39:01,478
- You'll need it where you're going.
- It seems we hit a nerve.

427
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:05,151
I'm not in the habit of chatting up
family to a prisoner.

428
00:39:05,419 --> 00:39:06,943
So you do have a family?

429
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:10,322
Wife and a son.

430
00:39:11,692 --> 00:39:14,024
You two rehearse this
at the gas station?

431
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:25,637
This isn't how we came.

432
00:39:25,873 --> 00:39:27,807
Shortcut. We're behind.

433
00:39:31,212 --> 00:39:32,679
Are you sure about this?

434
00:39:33,981 --> 00:39:36,506
I've come this way
plenty of times before.

435
00:39:36,784 --> 00:39:39,753
It's an old mining road.
Connects with the highway in 20 miles.

436
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,146
Save us an hour.

437
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:45,690
Well, what's the rush?

438
00:39:48,562 --> 00:39:51,292
I thought you were the one itching
to get back?

439
00:39:51,999 --> 00:39:53,557
Can I have some water?

440
00:39:56,971 --> 00:39:57,995
Thanks.

441
00:40:23,097 --> 00:40:25,258
What the fuck now?

442
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:27,096
What was that?

443
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:29,763
Come on, honey.

444
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:33,269
Come on, baby.

445
00:40:34,241 --> 00:40:35,708
Come on, sweetie.

446
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:40,041
No-good piece of shit!

447
00:40:44,585 --> 00:40:45,847
Why'd it stop?

448
00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:51,353
What do I look like,
the Amazing Kreskin?

449
00:40:55,429 --> 00:40:56,896
Jesus.

450
00:40:57,765 --> 00:40:59,426
We're in the middle of nowhere.

451
00:41:00,534 --> 00:41:04,265
No need to panic. I was a machinist's
mate with the fleet.

452
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,169
Give me that!

453
00:41:22,389 --> 00:41:24,289
That's an encouraging sign.

454
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,324
Oh, shit.

455
00:41:36,704 --> 00:41:38,171
Could it be the battery?

456
00:41:38,806 --> 00:41:41,172
No, it's not the fucking battery.

457
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:47,144
- Maybe it's all this rust.
- You don't know shit about engines.

458
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:48,848
Just trying to help.

459
00:42:01,795 --> 00:42:05,287
- What kind of gas did you get?
- Don't try to blame this on me.

460
00:42:05,532 --> 00:42:06,863
It was fine before.

461
00:42:07,134 --> 00:42:08,726
Sure it's not the battery?

462
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:15,169
Son of a bitch!

463
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:17,741
You should put a tent
over this circus.

464
00:42:18,846 --> 00:42:20,814
All right! We're shoving off.

465
00:42:23,684 --> 00:42:24,708
Where?

466
00:42:25,219 --> 00:42:27,153
- The way we came.
- You mean walk?

467
00:42:27,788 --> 00:42:29,517
No, I'm gonna carry you.

468
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,153
It's not like you're going anywhere.

469
00:42:44,204 --> 00:42:45,330
All right.

470
00:43:23,711 --> 00:43:26,544
This is the first exercise
I've had in weeks.

471
00:43:26,814 --> 00:43:30,045
- Glad you're enjoying yourself.
- Pass the water bottle.

472
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:33,013
No. One capful an hour.
Those are the rules.

473
00:43:33,287 --> 00:43:37,348
- Everything with you is rules.
- Rules are why we got water to drink.

474
00:43:39,426 --> 00:43:40,984
Single file.

475
00:43:53,273 --> 00:43:55,002
Whole thing's absurd.

476
00:43:55,375 --> 00:43:59,744
You join the Navy and you think,
worst case, you'll drown.

477
00:44:00,447 --> 00:44:02,210
But dying of thirst?

478
00:44:02,449 --> 00:44:04,144
Remember high school English?

479
00:44:04,418 --> 00:44:06,511
This is how they'd define "irony":

480
00:44:06,987 --> 00:44:09,080
Three sailors dying in the desert.

481
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:19,198
Rock, where you going?

482
00:44:23,937 --> 00:44:26,030
Highway's on the other side
of that hill.

483
00:44:27,741 --> 00:44:29,538
What, another shortcut?

484
00:44:31,311 --> 00:44:32,710
Don't start, Devane.

485
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:35,807
It seems extreme to leave the road...

486
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:38,483
...go across the desert to a hill.

487
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:40,846
It's not open for discussion.

488
00:44:41,121 --> 00:44:43,851
Either follow me or I'll
shoot you for mutiny.

489
00:45:14,655 --> 00:45:16,987
- Look, I found something.
- What?

490
00:45:17,191 --> 00:45:18,385
I don't know.

491
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:20,855
Looks like a sign or something.

492
00:45:21,094 --> 00:45:22,459
What's it say?

493
00:45:22,696 --> 00:45:24,288
Looks like "anger."

494
00:45:24,531 --> 00:45:26,260
Must have known Rock was coming.

495
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,468
Ha, ha, ha.

496
00:45:30,938 --> 00:45:32,735
That ain't "anger,"
that's "danger."

497
00:45:33,407 --> 00:45:34,806
From what?

498
00:45:57,831 --> 00:46:01,699
I'm pretty sure I got enough to file
a lawsuit against you guys.

499
00:46:17,084 --> 00:46:20,053
Let's raise the floor until we're
standing above ground.

500
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,652
I don't see you doing anything.

501
00:46:23,523 --> 00:46:25,787
Look for some rope or something.

502
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,320
No. We're fucked.

503
00:46:29,563 --> 00:46:30,860
Well, that's the spirit!

504
00:46:31,098 --> 00:46:33,362
Chief, we should've never
left the road.

505
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,727
That's history. Quit your whining.

506
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,771
We could all die here.

507
00:46:42,209 --> 00:46:43,801
Not if I kill you first.

508
00:46:44,044 --> 00:46:45,341
Go ahead and try it.

509
00:46:47,347 --> 00:46:49,076
Don't get me started.

510
00:46:49,449 --> 00:46:51,144
You don't scare me, pop.

511
00:46:51,418 --> 00:46:53,318
- That's it, you jack-off!
- Hold on!

512
00:46:53,553 --> 00:46:55,987
- Back off!
- There's a way out!

513
00:46:57,958 --> 00:46:58,856
How?

514
00:46:59,393 --> 00:47:02,624
If we stand on each other's shoulders,
one of us can reach the top.

515
00:47:11,405 --> 00:47:14,568
And who climbs out first?

516
00:47:15,742 --> 00:47:16,709
I do.

517
00:47:16,944 --> 00:47:18,969
- That's what I figured.
- I can't hold you!

518
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:21,077
- Forget it!
- Who cares who goes first?

519
00:47:21,315 --> 00:47:25,046
You think that once she got up there
she'd drop a rope down to us?!

520
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:26,843
Of course she will.

521
00:47:27,421 --> 00:47:29,514
- Won't you?
- I'm not a murderer.

522
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:32,486
How do I know? Maybe that's
why you got 7 to 10.

523
00:47:32,726 --> 00:47:34,250
You're a real asshole.

524
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:40,096
If she let us out, she'd be facing
at least seven years in the brig.

525
00:47:40,334 --> 00:47:43,098
- She'd cover the hole over us.
- Is that what you think?

526
00:47:43,337 --> 00:47:45,567
- That's what I think!
- You're wrong!

527
00:47:45,806 --> 00:47:47,137
What choice do we have?

528
00:47:47,374 --> 00:47:50,775
We either try this or we all stay
here and die like rats.

529
00:48:00,153 --> 00:48:02,212
Hey, hold still down there!

530
00:48:08,028 --> 00:48:09,723
Almost got it.

531
00:48:17,704 --> 00:48:18,932
I got it!

532
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:21,467
Okay, send her up!

533
00:48:27,714 --> 00:48:28,908
Got it!

534
00:48:42,562 --> 00:48:45,360
Okay! Throw it down!

535
00:48:47,501 --> 00:48:49,594
Come on, toss it down!

536
00:48:54,408 --> 00:48:55,602
Toni?

537
00:48:57,177 --> 00:48:58,269
Toni!

538
00:48:58,512 --> 00:49:02,881
- Give it a rest, she's gone.
- No, she's not. Toni!

539
00:49:04,184 --> 00:49:05,378
Sucker.

540
00:49:10,891 --> 00:49:12,358
She left us.

541
00:49:13,827 --> 00:49:16,057
That fucking bitch left us.

542
00:49:17,597 --> 00:49:19,064
Goddamn it!

543
00:49:19,466 --> 00:49:21,195
I gotta get to a phone.

544
00:49:21,735 --> 00:49:25,000
What is it with you
and that fucking phone?!

545
00:49:25,539 --> 00:49:26,870
She's back!

546
00:50:21,628 --> 00:50:24,153
You're damn lucky I come out
to get you at all.

547
00:50:24,397 --> 00:50:25,728
Fourth of July and all.

548
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:29,497
We got fireworks tonight.

549
00:50:30,337 --> 00:50:32,669
Some people say it's the best
in the county.

550
00:50:34,107 --> 00:50:36,098
Far as eats goes...

551
00:50:36,343 --> 00:50:39,141
...only place halfway decent
is Bucky's.

552
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:41,744
Them kids yours?

553
00:50:44,217 --> 00:50:46,344
Gee, I'd love to see
the fireworks, Pop.

554
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:49,248
- Can't we stay, Dad? Please?
- You should.

555
00:50:49,956 --> 00:50:52,823
I got a band playing tonight
over at Shorty's.

556
00:50:53,293 --> 00:50:55,090
Just ask for Dead in a Row.

557
00:51:34,734 --> 00:51:37,999
We'll try to have her ready
for you in the morning.

558
00:51:38,238 --> 00:51:40,672
It's been real. Adios.

559
00:51:46,546 --> 00:51:49,276
I gotta report back to base,
tell them what's going on.

560
00:51:49,549 --> 00:51:53,212
You book us two connecting rooms.
And you stay with me.

561
00:51:55,155 --> 00:51:56,144
In there.

562
00:51:59,459 --> 00:52:00,585
Boy.

563
00:52:01,428 --> 00:52:03,828
Gonna reach out and touch someone?

564
00:52:09,536 --> 00:52:10,901
Two rooms.

565
00:52:18,044 --> 00:52:21,013
Evening, skipper. Chief Petty Officer
Rock Reilly reporting.

566
00:52:21,248 --> 00:52:23,045
What's going on?

567
00:52:23,316 --> 00:52:26,183
We had mechanical problems
and have to spend the night.

568
00:52:26,419 --> 00:52:29,582
I can't authorize that.
Where the hell are you?

569
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:32,348
- Place called Yemassee.
- She has a flight tomorrow.

570
00:52:32,592 --> 00:52:35,527
I know she has to be on a plane
to San Diego at 0800.

571
00:52:35,762 --> 00:52:37,457
Get her down here ASAP!

572
00:52:37,697 --> 00:52:40,257
- We'll be there in time.
- You better be!

573
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,527
Aye-aye, sir.

574
00:52:53,313 --> 00:52:56,714
I was just trying to save myself
a shitload of paperwork.

575
00:52:57,183 --> 00:52:58,741
Thanks just the same.

576
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:05,217
Thanks for coming back.

577
00:53:06,326 --> 00:53:07,623
Let's go.

578
00:53:36,423 --> 00:53:38,254
Thought you never read them.

579
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,657
I got toothbrushes and toothpaste.

580
00:53:44,064 --> 00:53:47,261
So what'd she do? Espionage?
Jaywalking?

581
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,331
Overdue library books?

582
00:53:58,078 --> 00:53:59,306
Well?

583
00:54:04,784 --> 00:54:06,843
Watch her while I take a shower.

584
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,303
I knew you had nothing to wear.

585
00:54:30,377 --> 00:54:31,708
Kind of loud, I guess.

586
00:54:33,947 --> 00:54:35,244
It's beautiful.

587
00:54:35,482 --> 00:54:36,380
You like it?

588
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:38,510
Thank you.

589
00:54:56,069 --> 00:55:00,199
Two rarebits, one blue plate,
one soup. It's too hot for soup.

590
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,203
I'll bring you three salads.

591
00:55:02,442 --> 00:55:03,909
Anything else?

592
00:55:04,544 --> 00:55:06,535
Not unless I'm missing something.

593
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:10,272
Honey, you ain't missing nothing
as far as I can see.

594
00:55:12,619 --> 00:55:14,883
That goes double for you, ma'am.

595
00:55:15,822 --> 00:55:18,222
I just love a man in uniform!

596
00:55:20,727 --> 00:55:22,957
Now, there goes a real woman.

597
00:55:23,363 --> 00:55:24,660
Thanks.

598
00:55:24,898 --> 00:55:26,923
Got a real lady-killer here.

599
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:29,499
I'll give up my room for the cause.

600
00:55:29,736 --> 00:55:31,567
At least get rid of the ring.

601
00:55:31,805 --> 00:55:32,897
Ring don't matter.

602
00:55:34,007 --> 00:55:36,100
- Real pro.
- No.

603
00:55:36,609 --> 00:55:38,975
We separated 10 years ago.

604
00:55:46,686 --> 00:55:47,618
Thank you.

605
00:55:48,021 --> 00:55:49,113
Anytime.

606
00:55:57,664 --> 00:55:59,188
What about your son?

607
00:56:01,134 --> 00:56:02,158
With his mom.

608
00:56:05,472 --> 00:56:06,632
What about your brother?

609
00:56:11,377 --> 00:56:12,469
What about him?

610
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,838
File only has the facts.

611
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:17,811
That's all they're interested in.

612
00:56:18,251 --> 00:56:19,616
It didn't say if he...

613
00:56:19,853 --> 00:56:21,650
A week after I got sentenced.

614
00:56:25,058 --> 00:56:29,392
Guard came in with lunch and said,
"By the way, your brother died."

615
00:56:36,436 --> 00:56:38,336
I raised him, see?

616
00:56:38,571 --> 00:56:41,165
Me and my aunt, but me mostly.

617
00:56:44,077 --> 00:56:47,376
But he got wild long before
I joined the service.

618
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:54,186
Last couple years I started getting
calls for money.

619
00:56:54,487 --> 00:56:56,011
Bail, mostly.

620
00:56:57,123 --> 00:56:58,750
Then for other things.

621
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,858
That's when I started saying no.

622
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:05,925
Not that I've been an angel...

623
00:57:06,966 --> 00:57:09,457
...but at least I learned
where to draw the line.

624
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,970
I thought I had, anyway.

625
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:20,241
I get a call that Bobby's
lying in some hospital OD'd.

626
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,643
I asked for emergency leave.
Refused. Well, I flipped.

627
00:57:24,117 --> 00:57:25,516
And the assault?

628
00:57:26,619 --> 00:57:28,951
I hit an SP trying to bring me in.

629
00:57:29,188 --> 00:57:30,280
With a tire iron?

630
00:57:31,291 --> 00:57:33,555
You're handy with a tire iron too.

631
00:57:34,561 --> 00:57:36,893
Obviously, I wasn't thinking clearly.

632
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:41,432
And finding out about Bobby
like that...

633
00:57:41,668 --> 00:57:44,034
...it didn't make me a model prisoner.

634
00:57:48,007 --> 00:57:50,475
They just kept tagging stuff on me.

635
00:57:53,913 --> 00:57:56,177
I wasn't even there when he died.

636
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:03,518
Growing boy's gotta eat his beans.

637
00:58:06,359 --> 00:58:07,485
Thank you.

638
00:58:20,473 --> 00:58:22,941
Then they climbed suddenly and dived.

639
00:58:23,176 --> 00:58:25,701
Surprise strafing attack
on the enemy's airstrip.

640
00:58:25,945 --> 00:58:30,177
Smokey is like a super quarterback
on a super football team.

641
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:33,351
He is in constant touch
with our entire air group.

642
00:58:45,665 --> 00:58:49,533
As our first fighters race in toward
Marcus Island, they stay low...

643
00:58:49,769 --> 00:58:52,567
...hoping to escape detection
by the enemy's radar.

644
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:58,336
Stig speaking.

645
00:58:58,578 --> 00:59:00,045
Stig, it's Mr. Devane.

646
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:05,808
I got hung up on business.
I'll be in tomorrow to pick up my car.

647
00:59:06,085 --> 00:59:07,245
You want another car?

648
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,954
I want my car.
I'll be in tomorrow.

649
00:59:10,156 --> 00:59:11,783
There's a problem with the car?

650
00:59:12,659 --> 00:59:13,683
What car?

651
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:15,791
What? Your car.

652
00:59:16,029 --> 00:59:18,725
- The one your associate picked up.
- What?

653
00:59:18,965 --> 00:59:22,401
Mr... What was his name?
Mr. Howard picked up your car.

654
00:59:22,635 --> 00:59:24,296
- Mr. Howard?
- Yeah.

655
00:59:24,937 --> 00:59:26,199
Wait a minute.

656
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:28,504
Should I call the police?

657
00:59:28,741 --> 00:59:31,266
No, that's okay. I know Mr. Howard.

658
00:59:31,511 --> 00:59:33,979
Good, because he had all
the documents.

659
00:59:35,748 --> 00:59:37,010
That motherfucker.

660
00:59:37,283 --> 00:59:39,274
Stig, what's my car phone number?

661
00:59:40,453 --> 00:59:42,614
Let me look in the file.

662
00:59:43,022 --> 00:59:46,651
It's 803-655-9746.

663
00:59:46,893 --> 00:59:47,951
Thank you.

664
00:59:53,466 --> 00:59:55,957
Expensive car.
I hope he finds his car.

665
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:32,337
Howard here.

666
01:00:32,638 --> 01:00:33,605
Where are you?

667
01:00:35,308 --> 01:00:36,275
Where are you?

668
01:00:36,542 --> 01:00:37,770
I'm in a toilet.

669
01:00:38,077 --> 01:00:39,669
I'm in a car.

670
01:00:42,381 --> 01:00:43,973
It's funny.

671
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:48,677
- I don't have any hives.
- That's very good, Howard.

672
01:00:49,589 --> 01:00:53,116
Look, we had a few sales I didn't
have time to tell you about.

673
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:57,022
The car you're in and the money
in my desk was gonna be a surprise.

674
01:00:57,263 --> 01:00:58,161
A surprise.

675
01:00:59,899 --> 01:01:01,196
I was surprised.

676
01:01:01,434 --> 01:01:03,265
Good. That's very good, Howard.

677
01:01:03,636 --> 01:01:05,467
Howard, slow down...

678
01:01:05,705 --> 01:01:07,673
...and turn the fuck around.

679
01:01:07,907 --> 01:01:10,068
I don't want to get caught.

680
01:01:10,309 --> 01:01:13,904
But it's okay. Don't worry.
I got everything together.

681
01:01:14,147 --> 01:01:15,910
I hid everything...

682
01:01:16,149 --> 01:01:18,310
Okay, take the car out of my share.

683
01:01:18,584 --> 01:01:21,280
What share?
You don't have any share.

684
01:01:21,954 --> 01:01:26,482
You tried to scam the Navy out
of 150 grand without telling me.

685
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:31,018
Who else are you scamming?
You tried to scam me.

686
01:01:31,264 --> 01:01:35,257
- Listen to me, you son of a bitch!
- I've got a joke for you.

687
01:01:35,902 --> 01:01:37,733
If you get this right...

688
01:01:38,137 --> 01:01:39,399
...l'll turn around.

689
01:01:40,706 --> 01:01:42,173
Pull yourself together.

690
01:01:44,277 --> 01:01:46,575
How do you communicate with a fish?

691
01:01:46,813 --> 01:01:47,780
Howard.

692
01:01:48,014 --> 01:01:50,448
That's wrong! That's wrong!

693
01:01:51,384 --> 01:01:53,352
Get back here, you son of a bitch.

694
01:01:53,753 --> 01:01:55,448
No more hives.

695
01:02:02,695 --> 01:02:07,155
The mobile customer is away from the
phone or is beyond the service area.

696
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,300
Please try your call later.

697
01:02:13,139 --> 01:02:14,606
Goddamn it.

698
01:03:17,236 --> 01:03:19,704
Celebrating your last night out
the Navy?

699
01:03:23,042 --> 01:03:24,566
Something like that.

700
01:03:25,044 --> 01:03:26,477
Come on in.

701
01:03:42,962 --> 01:03:45,954
Somebody's always doing somebody
wrong on that radio.

702
01:03:47,033 --> 01:03:49,763
Cheer up. At least you're
not going to jail.

703
01:03:55,574 --> 01:03:56,541
Right.

704
01:04:00,146 --> 01:04:01,340
What's on your mind?

705
01:04:06,118 --> 01:04:07,983
I was ready to explode...

706
01:04:08,354 --> 01:04:10,117
...when you were on my lap.

707
01:04:10,323 --> 01:04:12,450
Is this the sweet-talking stage?

708
01:04:12,692 --> 01:04:14,626
- You kill me.
- You turn me on.

709
01:04:15,227 --> 01:04:16,694
You're wild.

710
01:04:17,129 --> 01:04:18,460
I'm ready.

711
01:04:58,104 --> 01:04:59,662
Don't go anywhere.

712
01:08:15,167 --> 01:08:16,156
What're you doing?!

713
01:08:46,765 --> 01:08:48,164
Howdy, ma'am.

714
01:08:49,501 --> 01:08:51,662
- What about your bike?
- Fuck the bike, just go!

715
01:08:51,904 --> 01:08:53,235
Yes, ma'am.

716
01:09:47,593 --> 01:09:50,187
- Where is she?
- You're gonna kill me.

717
01:09:50,429 --> 01:09:51,396
You didn't.

718
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:52,562
I did.

719
01:09:53,132 --> 01:09:55,896
Geez! I ought to... Get dressed!

720
01:10:02,074 --> 01:10:03,564
I must say...

721
01:10:04,176 --> 01:10:06,736
...l'm very curious.
- Don't be.

722
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,274
Interesting dress.

723
01:10:09,515 --> 01:10:13,076
Professional curiosity.
I'm in the fashion business.

724
01:10:13,786 --> 01:10:16,016
Lazlo Durkin's my name.

725
01:10:17,623 --> 01:10:19,022
My pals...

726
01:10:20,759 --> 01:10:22,886
...they call me Doggie.

727
01:10:27,099 --> 01:10:28,066
Great.

728
01:10:28,434 --> 01:10:32,598
- That'll be $86.97, please.
- Move it.

729
01:10:38,744 --> 01:10:40,905
- I don't have no three cents.
- Keep it.

730
01:10:41,146 --> 01:10:42,613
Thank you very much.

731
01:10:43,215 --> 01:10:46,184
Don't you want to know what
was the matter with it?

732
01:10:47,586 --> 01:10:49,884
Feminine hygiene products.

733
01:10:50,089 --> 01:10:51,147
What?

734
01:10:51,623 --> 01:10:53,887
Tampons in your tank.

735
01:11:07,506 --> 01:11:10,134
It's not that what you're
wearing is not nice...

736
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:14,501
...because I think it's tremendous.

737
01:11:14,747 --> 01:11:17,181
But I have a dress or two
in my trunk...

738
01:11:17,449 --> 01:11:19,815
...that would look dynamite on you.

739
01:11:20,519 --> 01:11:23,852
And you're welcome to one
if you want.

740
01:11:28,927 --> 01:11:30,485
I'd like that.

741
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:32,795
I tell you what, Doggie...

742
01:11:33,065 --> 01:11:35,397
...why don't we pull off over here?

743
01:11:35,634 --> 01:11:37,864
- How about right here?
- Great.

744
01:11:38,103 --> 01:11:40,731
Make it someplace nice and private.

745
01:11:41,006 --> 01:11:42,667
Then pick one out for me.

746
01:11:43,542 --> 01:11:45,339
Well, okay!

747
01:11:47,079 --> 01:11:48,671
Oh, my God!

748
01:11:48,981 --> 01:11:50,141
I have some...

749
01:11:50,649 --> 01:11:52,549
...lace ladies' things...

750
01:11:52,785 --> 01:11:55,948
...that you might want to try on too?

751
01:11:56,522 --> 01:11:58,012
Sounds good.

752
01:11:58,290 --> 01:12:00,588
Oh! This is Doggie's day.

753
01:12:04,062 --> 01:12:05,586
I gotta admit...

754
01:12:05,831 --> 01:12:07,128
...she's good.

755
01:12:09,268 --> 01:12:11,099
Played you like a fiddle.

756
01:12:13,405 --> 01:12:15,930
Came on to me at the start
of this detail.

757
01:12:23,949 --> 01:12:24,916
Hot damn!

758
01:12:25,217 --> 01:12:27,208
Know what I want you to do first?

759
01:12:28,187 --> 01:12:32,021
I want you to hop into
a leopard-skin miniskirt.

760
01:12:32,257 --> 01:12:34,225
Why don't we start with the lingerie?

761
01:12:34,493 --> 01:12:37,394
- You are a wild one!
- Yes, I am.

762
01:12:37,629 --> 01:12:38,960
You know something?

763
01:12:40,365 --> 01:12:42,424
I got some crotchless panties...

764
01:12:42,668 --> 01:12:44,397
...that are so lovely.

765
01:12:44,937 --> 01:12:47,132
They'd look so good on you.

766
01:12:49,475 --> 01:12:52,239
I am losing my professional touch.

767
01:12:53,712 --> 01:12:55,304
You hurry back, now.

768
01:12:55,547 --> 01:12:57,913
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am!

769
01:12:59,818 --> 01:13:03,117
You hold still. Don't get
too excited without me, now.

770
01:13:05,057 --> 01:13:08,083
Hey, come back here!
You come back here!

771
01:13:08,494 --> 01:13:10,121
You come on back here!

772
01:13:12,698 --> 01:13:14,825
Oh, my God!

773
01:13:41,126 --> 01:13:42,423
Stop hitting my van!

774
01:13:45,964 --> 01:13:47,056
Watch it!

775
01:13:48,834 --> 01:13:50,825
Turn the wheel!
Hit the brake!

776
01:14:16,361 --> 01:14:18,261
Son of a bitch!

777
01:14:19,298 --> 01:14:23,359
Geez, whatever you do, don't
fucking move! Don't fucking move!

778
01:14:23,602 --> 01:14:24,796
Who the fuck's moving?!

779
01:14:33,979 --> 01:14:36,345
What the hell now?

780
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:53,721
Holy shit.

781
01:14:56,568 --> 01:14:59,799
- I told you not to move!
- I didn't move!

782
01:15:09,281 --> 01:15:10,248
Won't start.

783
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:12,474
Put it in park.

784
01:15:18,123 --> 01:15:19,249
Won't move!

785
01:15:19,491 --> 01:15:20,856
Put it in R!

786
01:15:49,154 --> 01:15:51,349
Hi, boys! You okay?

787
01:15:54,359 --> 01:15:55,257
Don't!

788
01:15:56,862 --> 01:15:57,829
Rock!

789
01:16:17,282 --> 01:16:19,614
Johnson, pull over now!

790
01:16:19,885 --> 01:16:21,079
No!

791
01:16:21,586 --> 01:16:23,520
Pull over Johnson!

792
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:27,354
Chief, come on! Chief!

793
01:16:28,493 --> 01:16:30,222
Pull over, Toni!

794
01:16:30,829 --> 01:16:32,387
Toni, pull over!

795
01:17:00,659 --> 01:17:03,150
No running! Do you hear me?
No running!

796
01:17:10,869 --> 01:17:13,394
- Eddie, let me go!
- Hold her, Devane!

797
01:17:16,074 --> 01:17:18,406
Damn it, you're through! Get up!

798
01:17:24,716 --> 01:17:27,514
What's that? Another escape attempt?
Is that it?

799
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:30,012
- No, It's mine!
- Give me that!

800
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:33,022
Give me it!

801
01:17:46,271 --> 01:17:47,761
Funeral register.

802
01:18:00,252 --> 01:18:03,688
- You're not allowed here. Come on!
- Fore!

803
01:18:04,055 --> 01:18:05,545
Get out of here!

804
01:18:05,824 --> 01:18:08,884
Come on, get out of here.
Go on! You're gonna get hit!

805
01:18:26,211 --> 01:18:27,303
Turn it!

806
01:18:27,746 --> 01:18:29,008
The other way, you idiot!

807
01:18:29,247 --> 01:18:32,410
- You didn't say which way!
- I'm telling you now!

808
01:18:33,819 --> 01:18:35,810
Harder! Enough!

809
01:18:36,087 --> 01:18:37,918
Would you make up your mind?

810
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:44,258
- Go over onto your side.
- Be glad to.

811
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,367
Put on your belt.

812
01:18:49,601 --> 01:18:50,829
Back to that again?

813
01:18:51,069 --> 01:18:52,969
- I gave you an order!
- I heard.

814
01:18:53,638 --> 01:18:55,697
- The belt, Devane!
- Fuck the belt!

815
01:18:56,141 --> 01:18:58,609
You heard me.
I said, fuck the belt, chief!

816
01:19:10,155 --> 01:19:11,918
- What's your problem?
- You are.

817
01:19:12,157 --> 01:19:13,590
Do something about it.

818
01:19:13,825 --> 01:19:15,452
I just want to warn you...

819
01:19:15,694 --> 01:19:17,161
...I got seven years karate.

820
01:19:18,597 --> 01:19:20,258
Twenty years bar fighting.

821
01:19:20,498 --> 01:19:22,056
This is a bad fucking dream.

822
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:25,895
And I'm gonna be your worst nightmare.
Now, get in that van!

823
01:19:31,977 --> 01:19:33,342
Come on, Devane.

824
01:20:22,127 --> 01:20:23,219
Come on, pop!

825
01:20:56,328 --> 01:20:58,023
Get up!

826
01:21:30,595 --> 01:21:31,892
Pit stop.

827
01:21:53,351 --> 01:21:54,545
Can I get you a drink?

828
01:21:54,819 --> 01:21:57,049
How about a Bud, gorgeous?

829
01:22:25,683 --> 01:22:27,844
Shouldn't let a man drink alone.

830
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:53,543
Shit.

831
01:22:56,581 --> 01:22:58,173
Mind if I join you?

832
01:23:00,952 --> 01:23:02,044
It's a free country.

833
01:23:12,931 --> 01:23:14,398
I gotta hand it to you...

834
01:23:16,034 --> 01:23:17,160
Thank you.

835
01:23:17,602 --> 01:23:18,899
Likewise.

836
01:23:20,205 --> 01:23:21,832
That was sincerity.

837
01:23:23,374 --> 01:23:25,205
Got a different spin on it.

838
01:23:25,443 --> 01:23:27,570
Is that what that was?

839
01:23:27,946 --> 01:23:29,709
What's that supposed to mean?

840
01:23:34,219 --> 01:23:35,948
Drop him a line.

841
01:23:37,589 --> 01:23:38,647
What?

842
01:23:39,224 --> 01:23:41,385
That's how you communicate
with a fish.

843
01:23:43,428 --> 01:23:44,588
That's right.

844
01:23:45,396 --> 01:23:46,693
I heard it all.

845
01:23:46,931 --> 01:23:49,058
More than I wanted to,
let me tell you.

846
01:23:51,002 --> 01:23:52,435
What are you gonna do?

847
01:23:53,171 --> 01:23:54,331
Do?

848
01:23:56,007 --> 01:23:58,066
If it's a question of blackmail...

849
01:23:59,811 --> 01:24:01,335
Is that what you think of me?

850
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,672
Hell, you could turn me in.

851
01:24:04,649 --> 01:24:06,173
Oh, God.

852
01:24:06,451 --> 01:24:08,942
You must think I'm
a real cold-hearted bitch.

853
01:24:11,489 --> 01:24:13,957
Well, you don't know
anything about me.

854
01:24:14,225 --> 01:24:16,887
The fact is, you belong where I am
more than I do.

855
01:24:17,762 --> 01:24:18,956
I know.

856
01:24:30,808 --> 01:24:32,366
Somebody fart?

857
01:25:53,891 --> 01:25:55,449
Finally made it.

858
01:25:57,161 --> 01:25:58,719
What happened to you two?

859
01:26:00,198 --> 01:26:02,689
Well, you'd never believe it, but...

860
01:26:03,635 --> 01:26:05,262
...we stopped for gas...

861
01:26:05,503 --> 01:26:08,165
...some Marines started spouting off
about the Navy...

862
01:26:08,406 --> 01:26:11,204
...and me and Devane had to
straighten them out.

863
01:26:11,709 --> 01:26:12,869
Outstanding.

864
01:26:14,345 --> 01:26:15,505
You're learning.

865
01:26:16,047 --> 01:26:17,708
Any trouble with her?

866
01:26:21,286 --> 01:26:22,753
No.

867
01:26:23,187 --> 01:26:25,985
- A model prisoner.
- I'll note it in her report.

868
01:26:26,791 --> 01:26:30,750
You've been rescheduled to fly out
of Charleston tomorrow at 0800.

869
01:26:31,062 --> 01:26:34,190
Arrive San Diego in the afternoon
to start your sentence.

870
01:26:34,432 --> 01:26:35,729
Any questions?

871
01:26:38,202 --> 01:26:39,692
I got her now, boys.

872
01:26:58,256 --> 01:27:00,053
Seaman, you can let her go now.

873
01:27:00,892 --> 01:27:02,325
It's over, Eddie.

874
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:03,892
Let her go.

875
01:27:04,696 --> 01:27:06,027
Go on.

876
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,620
When'd you say your discharge was?

877
01:28:05,156 --> 01:28:07,147
2100 hours.

878
01:28:13,865 --> 01:28:15,662
Have one on me, sailor.

879
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:17,431
Yes, chief.

880
01:28:17,668 --> 01:28:19,135
Name's Rock.

881
01:28:22,974 --> 01:28:24,635
You take care, Rock.

882
01:28:26,010 --> 01:28:27,500
You too, kid.

883
01:28:50,868 --> 01:28:52,335
Hey, sis!

884
01:28:52,637 --> 01:28:54,036
It's our lucky day.

885
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:57,036
- We've been looking for you, girlie.
- And here you are.

886
01:28:58,176 --> 01:28:59,541
Sorry, fella.

887
01:28:59,777 --> 01:29:01,768
My dance card's all full.

888
01:29:19,664 --> 01:29:20,926
Hey, Vance?

889
01:29:21,399 --> 01:29:24,527
- Ain't these man's drinks?
- Sure are, Rory.

890
01:29:24,769 --> 01:29:26,634
What's sis doing drinking them?

891
01:29:26,871 --> 01:29:27,860
Buying them...

892
01:29:28,105 --> 01:29:29,265
...for us.

893
01:29:29,707 --> 01:29:31,072
Ain't that right?

894
01:29:37,815 --> 01:29:39,407
I got him! I got him!

895
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:51,653
Dance card's full.

896
01:29:51,963 --> 01:29:54,693
Jesus.
You guys don't give up, do you?

897
01:29:57,869 --> 01:29:59,803
Oh, shit.

898
01:30:02,106 --> 01:30:04,165
Goddamn, that felt good.

899
01:30:04,408 --> 01:30:05,705
You boys go home.

900
01:30:05,943 --> 01:30:07,410
Motherfuckers.

901
01:30:08,279 --> 01:30:10,679
- Let's go fuck somebody up.
- Fuck somebody up?

902
01:30:10,915 --> 01:30:12,212
Hell, yeah.

903
01:30:12,483 --> 01:30:13,472
Come on.

904
01:30:27,865 --> 01:30:29,457
What are you doing up there?

905
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:31,224
I don't know yet.

906
01:30:42,146 --> 01:30:43,545
Get off of there!

907
01:30:43,781 --> 01:30:45,146
I'm gonna save her.

908
01:30:46,617 --> 01:30:48,050
No, you're not.

909
01:30:55,993 --> 01:30:57,790
Oh, wonderful!

910
01:31:13,411 --> 01:31:14,639
Wake up!

911
01:31:15,346 --> 01:31:17,007
Come on. Get up.

912
01:31:17,481 --> 01:31:18,505
What time is it?

913
01:31:18,749 --> 01:31:20,307
It's late. We've gotta go.

914
01:31:20,585 --> 01:31:21,779
I've gotta sleep.

915
01:31:22,053 --> 01:31:23,418
Put these on.

916
01:31:24,922 --> 01:31:27,686
There's a small loan in there
to get you started.

917
01:31:49,246 --> 01:31:51,441
Stay with her while I unlock the van.

918
01:31:54,018 --> 01:31:55,918
- Give me the keys.
- I ain't got them.

919
01:31:56,153 --> 01:31:58,986
- Well, yeah, man.
- No, you got the keys.

920
01:31:59,323 --> 01:32:01,848
Oh, shit, man! I drove!

921
01:32:04,528 --> 01:32:05,893
Where are we going?

922
01:32:06,130 --> 01:32:07,097
Here.

923
01:32:07,465 --> 01:32:09,330
Just drink the coffee.

924
01:32:09,767 --> 01:32:11,860
Remember the back door?

925
01:32:21,012 --> 01:32:22,809
- That him?
- Yeah.

926
01:32:32,657 --> 01:32:34,284
I never saw you.

927
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:49,936
What was that?

928
01:32:51,842 --> 01:32:53,036
I don't know.

929
01:33:00,785 --> 01:33:03,151
- This is a new van!
- It's got gas!

930
01:33:03,821 --> 01:33:05,379
Oh, shit!

931
01:33:05,656 --> 01:33:07,248
Is there a phone around?

932
01:33:07,491 --> 01:33:09,049
There's an emergency phone.

933
01:33:11,062 --> 01:33:12,461
I'll call.

934
01:33:18,169 --> 01:33:19,636
Over and out.

935
01:33:43,861 --> 01:33:45,829
You hit a guy in the nose, see?

936
01:33:46,063 --> 01:33:47,894
You hit him with your palm...

937
01:33:48,132 --> 01:33:49,963
...you can send that bone right...

938
01:33:50,367 --> 01:33:52,927
I mean, right back up into his head.

939
01:33:55,172 --> 01:33:56,730
Where'd you learn that?

940
01:33:57,308 --> 01:33:58,935
Rerun of Kung Fu.

941
01:34:00,044 --> 01:34:03,571
Yeah, that's that Bruce Lee thing.

942
01:34:03,814 --> 01:34:04,872
Yeah.

943
01:34:07,284 --> 01:34:08,444
Shit.

944
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:10,687
Shit, here comes our tow now.

945
01:34:17,895 --> 01:34:19,522
This ain't one of our trucks.

946
01:34:19,764 --> 01:34:21,755
Boys, this is your lucky day.

947
01:34:21,999 --> 01:34:24,092
I must've been right behind you.

948
01:34:24,335 --> 01:34:26,826
Was on the bridge
when I heard it on the radio.

949
01:34:27,071 --> 01:34:28,470
- How you doing?
- All right.

950
01:34:28,739 --> 01:34:30,468
This ain't no Navy vehicle.

951
01:34:30,708 --> 01:34:32,642
Navy vehicle, sure ain't.

952
01:34:32,877 --> 01:34:34,936
We're private contractors.

953
01:34:35,179 --> 01:34:36,908
My boss is an ex-Squid.

954
01:34:37,148 --> 01:34:39,776
Still got friends at the motor pool.

955
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:41,779
Sometimes they throw him a bone.

956
01:34:42,052 --> 01:34:44,282
- You a private firm?
- That's right.

957
01:34:44,522 --> 01:34:48,356
Just last month they had me towing
a truckload of torpedoes!

958
01:34:48,993 --> 01:34:50,017
Oh, man!

959
01:34:50,261 --> 01:34:52,058
Fine, go on, hook it up.

960
01:34:52,296 --> 01:34:53,763
- All right.
- Get the girl.

961
01:34:54,899 --> 01:34:56,389
Hold it!

962
01:34:58,235 --> 01:35:01,966
Ride up front with me.
It's against the law to ride in back.

963
01:35:02,206 --> 01:35:04,640
- We'll get the girl.
- Already got her hooked up.

964
01:35:04,875 --> 01:35:06,740
Let me lift her first.

965
01:35:10,114 --> 01:35:11,445
Go on!

966
01:35:28,599 --> 01:35:30,362
We'll get the girl now.

967
01:35:30,668 --> 01:35:33,034
Go! Go! Move it! Move!

968
01:35:33,270 --> 01:35:35,534
That's right. Go get her out, boys!

969
01:35:37,641 --> 01:35:39,108
Get her out!

970
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:44,438
Got the keys?

971
01:35:47,117 --> 01:35:49,278
- Damn it!
- Come back with our prisoner!

972
01:35:51,488 --> 01:35:54,616
Get back here, you son of a bitch!

973
01:36:01,398 --> 01:36:02,729
Yes!

974
01:36:33,330 --> 01:36:34,763
Boss, the phone!

975
01:36:45,009 --> 01:36:46,499
All right, all right!

976
01:36:47,811 --> 01:36:49,608
Rock Reilly's residence.

977
01:36:49,847 --> 01:36:51,007
Listen, Rock!

978
01:36:51,248 --> 01:36:54,342
The first rule is, there are no rules!

979
01:36:54,618 --> 01:36:57,280
You got nothing better to do
than bother a retired man?

980
01:36:58,122 --> 01:36:59,783
Oh, one last thing:

981
01:37:00,090 --> 01:37:02,149
We love you, Rock!

982
01:37:28,485 --> 01:37:30,749
Katie, for God's sake,
what're you doing?

983
01:37:30,988 --> 01:37:32,717
My son will be here any minute!

984
01:37:32,957 --> 01:37:35,653
You are so adorable, Rocky baby.

985
01:37:43,367 --> 01:37:46,359
- Don't we have time?
- No, I mean it. Get dressed.

986
01:37:46,603 --> 01:37:48,230
You gotta get ready.

987
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:50,869
I'm a girl who's always ready.
