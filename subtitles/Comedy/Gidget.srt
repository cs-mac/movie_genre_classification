1
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,944
 She acts sort of teenage 

2
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,846
 Just in-between age 

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,383
 Looks about 4 foot 3 

4
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,885
 Although she's just
Small fry 

5
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:22,754
 Just about so-high 

6
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:26,391
 Gidget is the one for me 

7
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:29,694
 A regular tomboy
But dressed for a prom 

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:34,432
 Boy, how cute
Can one gal be? 

9
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,634
Although she's not king size 

10
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:38,803
 Her finger is ring size 

11
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:42,106
 Gidget is the one for me 

12
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:46,044
 If she says she loves you 

13
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:50,248
 You can bet your boots
She loves you 

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,551
 If she says she hates you 

15
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:57,955
 That can also mean
She loves you 

16
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:02,727
 It very well may be
She's just a baby 

17
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,197
 Speaking romantically 

18
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:10,368
 If that's a bad feature
I'll be the teacher 

19
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,605
 That's the way
It's going to be 

20
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:18,709
 Gidget is the one for me 

21
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:21,779
<i> This summer was</i>
<i> the turning point in my life.</i>

22
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:25,450
<i>For 16 years, I'd gone</i>
<i> blindly along enjoying myself</i>

23
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:30,321
<i>like a fool who never guesses</i>
<i> what's in store for her.</i>

24
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:31,789
<i>Then...</i>

25
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:32,657
Oh, Patti, please...

26
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,659
Now, hear this,
Francie Lawrence.

27
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,862
The day, the hour,
and the moment has arrived.

28
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:38,696
Not for me, it hasn't.

29
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,965
Aw, gee, Patti, last year
and the year before,

30
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:41,966
didn't we all have a ball?

31
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,469
I mean, why can't we go on
being like that always?

32
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,105
Why do we have to spoil it all?

33
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:53,111
Keep your shirts on.
She's coming!

34
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:56,447
Oh, be realistic, Francie.

35
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,782
Now, ask yourself
one vital question.

36
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,618
To date, what has your
life added up to?

37
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,489
Okay, so you're an "A"
student. That's parent stuff.

38
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,992
Do you know anybody else
it impresses?

39
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:08,726
No, I guess not.

40
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,695
And as for this
king-size fiddle...

41
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:15,433
It's probably a symptom
of your whole problem.

42
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:18,803
Well, I'll go get my gear.

43
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:27,345
About her problem,

44
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,913
exactly what
would you say it is?

45
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,815
Well, she's more fish than dish.

46
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,152
To put it bluntly, the kid's studied
up on about everything but sex,

47
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:38,489
and let's face it, like most
of us, she's pushing 17.

48
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,524
Oh, not till next month.

49
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:42,226
Oh, listen, B.L.,
you don't have to go.

50
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,394
You've got social security

51
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:46,664
just by wearing
Buck's fraternity pin,

52
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,465
but take it from me,

53
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,267
Francie has got to make it
this summer,

54
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,102
or she'll be a social outcast.

55
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,371
Oh! Oh, hi, Mrs. Lawrence.

56
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,206
Oh, hello, girls.

57
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,407
So long, Mom.

58
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,942
Bye-bye, dear.

59
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,644
Have a good time.

60
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,879
Sure.

61
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:06,017
Betty-Louise, do you think
Francie didn't want to go?

62
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,085
Oh, she's just a bit skittish.

63
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,922
After all,
this is her first manhunt.

64
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,156
Her first what?

65
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,225
Manhunt!

66
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,073
Count them, girls.

67
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,943
Six gorgeous hunks of male,

68
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,612
almost enough
for second helpings.

69
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,815
Well, what's holding us up?

70
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:41,152
Well, hey!

71
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,955
We're, we're not just
gonna barge in on them.

72
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:44,555
Hardly.

73
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:48,993
Please, a maneuver like
this takes technique.

74
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,721
Hey, check this
swing, Lover Boy.

75
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,356
That looks like your style.

76
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,924
Francie...

77
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,126
Peel, girl.

78
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:32,169
Make like you can't
see them for sand.

79
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,672
We'll have them drooling.

80
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:47,485
Hey, hotshot, check this one.

81
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,524
Hubba, hubba, hubba.

82
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:56,560
Hey, Red! Hello, Red!

83
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,963
Oh, hey, look at this...

84
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,898
Aw...

85
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,536
Aw...

86
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,444
Did you get the look
that doll gave me?

87
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:18,416
I swear it scorched
my bathing suit half off.

88
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,285
What are you trying to
do, spoil the picture?

89
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:22,653
Come on, get with it.

90
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:26,824
This is supposed
to co-op venture.

91
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,638
My aching back.

92
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,407
I wonder what's
taking them so long.

93
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,109
You know, something's screwy.

94
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,478
Well, they're not even looking
this way.

95
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,681
Maybe they didn't notice us.

96
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,925
Hey, remember?

97
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,360
Ball!

98
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:18,209
Okay, Babe Ruth, knock it off.

99
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:18,743
Huh?

100
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,111
Look, set her
straight, will you,

101
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:23,647
before she has us signed up
with the major leagues.

102
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:49,807
Hey, Moondoggie,

103
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,943
you're not going for that
jailbait caper, are you?

104
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,081
Hey, kid.

105
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,449
Do you see those girls
over there?

106
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:02,686
Tell them the man said to take
the toy back the nursery.

107
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,488
All right?

108
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:21,005
The man said for me to take
the toy back to the nursery.

109
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,274
Well?

110
00:07:26,378 --> 00:07:27,378
Aw, come off it, kids.

111
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,580
Those guys
just aren't interested.

112
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,582
So who needs them?

113
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,150
Honey, maybe you need
a few hormone shots.

114
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,219
Well, if this is a manhunt,
I'll take swimming.

115
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:38,289
I'm going to get my gear.

116
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,657
Well, let's call today
a dry run.

117
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,126
I tell you, why don't
we go to Santa Monica,

118
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,528
but this time
without the papoose in tow.

119
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,299
Yeah, Patti, all she does
is curb our operation.

120
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,182
Francie... you've always
been a part of a foursome.

121
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,584
You can't quit now.

122
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,119
You'll be fringed,
out in the cold.

123
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,121
Now, you know
you don't want that.

124
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:14,492
Well, it... it's already
happened, hasn't it, Patti?

125
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,662
I guess I just don't
belong anymore.

126
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:22,299
Really!

127
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:26,470
Letting eligible men see you
in an outfit like that.

128
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:29,006
Haven't you any pride?

129
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:29,406
Pride?

130
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:34,311
I guess I'll have to look up the
definition of the word again.

131
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,385
<i> Okay,</i>
<i> so the word's around...</i>

132
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,287
<i>I'm for the birds.</i>

133
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,482
Help! Help!

134
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,484
Help!

135
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,361
Help! Help! Somebody, help!

136
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,530
Help!

137
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,734
Help!

138
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:13,611
Help! Help! Somebody, help!

139
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,614
This is it. Now, hold
on for your life.

140
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:53,350
We're gonna shoot the curl.

141
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,264
You feel okay?

142
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,900
I... I guess.

143
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,704
Hi.

144
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,505
Hi.

145
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,642
Hey, Mr. Lifeguard Hero, sir!

146
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,210
Nice fishing, Moondoggie,

147
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,312
but, uh, what is it?

148
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,114
Hey, some pull-out, huh?

149
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,248
Yeah, wasn't it?

150
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,750
Hey, can we do it again?

151
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,785
For your information,
you almost drowned.

152
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,354
Yeah, you better listen
to Moondoggie here, miss.

153
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,056
See, this beach
is for surfers only.

154
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,424
It's too dangerous for dames.

155
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:09,526
Dames?

156
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:10,494
Oh, no, I'm no dame.

157
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,029
Oh, well,
what do you know?

158
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,698
It has all the earmarks
of a dame.

159
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,801
You better get your
monocle, Lord Byron.

160
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,203
Those are not ears.

161
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:23,373
It's a dame all right, only
kind of a pint-sized version.

162
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,541
Maybe she had amnesia?

163
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:25,642
If I just took her up to the...

164
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:29,146
Okay, okay, you guys,
knock it off.

165
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:29,847
Win a few, lose a few.

166
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,281
Be smart, kid. Why don't you
go back to your playmates.

167
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:34,118
Oh, but I haven't even thanked
you for saving my life...

168
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,285
Okay, so now you have.

169
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:40,190
Go on back to Mama...
and run, don't walk.

170
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,376
Hey, what are you, robbing
the cradle, Moondoggie?

171
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,078
Hey, she's a trifle
young, don't you think?

172
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,914
My hero, sir. I'm so
glad you saved me!

173
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,516
Artificial respiration, please.

174
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,451
Guess I'm getting kicked out...

175
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,186
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

176
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,088
Hey...

177
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:27,437
Oh!

178
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,139
You gonna be sick?

179
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,176
Are you Stinky? Yeah.

180
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,844
Gee, if... if I had
one of those boards,

181
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:37,014
I could be a surfer too. I
could come down here and surf

182
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,183
anytime I wanted to,
just like the guys.

183
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:43,053
You kidding? You
couldn't even lift one.

184
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,125
Hey!

185
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:51,094
Okay, okay. All right!

186
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,030
There.

187
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,767
That's not the only catch.

188
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,535
What?

189
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,238
They cost about 75 clams apiece.

190
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,841
Even an old used one is $25.

191
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:08,178
All I've got left out of
my allowance is 4.50.

192
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:12,950
Hey, but my credit's good!

193
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,719
What do you think we're running
here, a finance company?

194
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:19,890
But I just got to have one of
those boards, I've just got to.

195
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:20,657
What's the matter?

196
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,293
Won't the little girls play
dollies with you anymore?

197
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:27,197
Oh, them, all they
care about is...

198
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,334
Forget it.

199
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:36,740
Gee, all I wanted to do
is surf. That's all.

200
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,413
25 is rock bottom, huh?

201
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,053
Yeah, rock bottom.

202
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,457
Okay, I'll bring it.

203
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,759
Yeah? When?

204
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,195
Tomorrow.

205
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,697
A manhunt?

206
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,000
Uh-huh.

207
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:06,570
Francie? Our little girl?

208
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,272
Our teenage daughter, Russ.

209
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:11,408
I don't care what she is,
Dorothy, I won't have it.

210
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,243
It's a biological fact, Russ.

211
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:16,313
The female matures
earlier than the male.

212
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,681
A manhunt...

213
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:18,081
Mm-hmm.

214
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,417
My daughter's out
traipsing around luring...

215
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,286
well, who knows what hoodlums.

216
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,021
Dorothy, why did she have to go?

217
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,556
Oh, I don't think
Francie was eager to.

218
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,826
Well, in the name of heavens
will you tell me what is this,

219
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,495
a place that you escape from?

220
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,297
Shh!

221
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:41,071
That's a manhunter?

222
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,841
Well, who did you
expect, Kim Novak?

223
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:56,520
Hi, Mom and Pop. I'm home.

224
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,024
I'm going to give that young
lady a good talking to.

225
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:04,161
Russ, don't you dare light
into that poor child.

226
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,662
I'm not going to light into her,

227
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:06,797
I'm only going to give her
a talking to.

228
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,368
Growing up is a very slow and
painful process for a girl.

229
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:11,935
Well...

230
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,137
Darling, do you have a headache?

231
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,739
Yes, I do. I think
it's the glasses.

232
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,407
Oh, come here.

233
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,242
Lie down.

234
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,779
Oh, Russ, can't you see?

235
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,315
She went because she had to.

236
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,550
A girl needs love.

237
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,851
Well, I love her.

238
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,988
She's my little girl,
my little baby.

239
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,424
I'd do anything for her, and...

240
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,326
I have it!

241
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,838
Pop, can I get you
your slippers?

242
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,106
How about a pipe?

243
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,140
No, no, no, no, no.

244
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,875
How would you like
to do your old dad

245
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,176
a big, big favor, though?

246
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:53,877
Mow the lawn?

247
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,178
No, no. You're all off.
Sit down.

248
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,215
Uh, Dorothy, you remember
Jeffrey Matthews?

249
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,082
No, I don't, dear.

250
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,318
I introduced you to him
at the convention.

251
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,152
He smokes a pipe. Oh, yes.

252
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:05,522
Yeah, well, his son is
out here for the summer.

253
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,891
He's a wonderful boy... er, man.

254
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:08,925
He's a college man.

255
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,761
A-a-a real serious student

256
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,462
and accomplished musician.

257
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:13,930
Daddy...

258
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:14,664
Now, naturally,

259
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:18,035
Jeffrey would like to think
that his boy was dating

260
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,036
the right kind of girl.

261
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,170
Daddy, how could you?

262
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,805
Francie! How could you?

263
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:22,439
How could I what?

264
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,242
Oh, gosh, Mom, you know
how I feel about dates.

265
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,010
But I thought you
enjoyed yourself.

266
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,679
Oh, that hot-wet-hand-set.

267
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:30,881
Oh, it's so icky!

268
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,151
I... I mean, breathing down
a person's neck.

269
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,619
Well, now, take Dizzy
Maynard, for instance.

270
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:36,920
Now, there's a perfectly
swell guy

271
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:39,656
when he's helping me dissect
snails in a biology class.

272
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:43,126
On a date, ugh,
he gets all unglued.

273
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,896
Well, he probably was nervous.

274
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,365
He was only a mess.

275
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:49,966
Oh, Daddy, I mean,

276
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:53,403
I... I don't mean to be edgy
or rude to you, but...

277
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,239
Oh, gee, I've got
a real serious problem.

278
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,374
Darling, why didn't you tell us?

279
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,976
Oh, what is it, Francie?

280
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,912
Money.

281
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:02,479
Money?

282
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,082
I've got to raise a mint
in a hurry.

283
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,250
Well, how much is a mint?

284
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:13,190
Well, including what I have
on hand, an extra...

285
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,159
21.50 would do it.

286
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,861
21.50 is too much.
Oh, Pop, please.

287
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,563
Oh, Pop, it could
mean sheer heaven

288
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,666
or months and months
of stark solitude.

289
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,434
Do you know what
she's talking about?

290
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,268
No, I don't.

291
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,206
Well, you see, what I
need the money for is...

292
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,006
a surfboard.

293
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:31,007
A surfboard? A surfboard?

294
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,642
A surfboard! I mean, I'm a
perfectly good swimmer,

295
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,479
and, gee, I'd be
extra-super careful.

296
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,481
Oh, please!

297
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,482
Now, honest, surfing
is out of this world!

298
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,251
You just can't imagine the
thrill of shooting the curl!

299
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:42,953
Well, it positively surpasses

300
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,989
every living emotion
I've ever had!

301
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,990
You must admit, dear,

302
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:50,060
she does make it
sound attractive.

303
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,294
Well, I don't mind learning

304
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,996
my daughter enjoys the pleasures

305
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,397
of an outdoor sport...

306
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:57,868
Oh, but, Daddy,
surfing is very outdoorish!

307
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,503
Oh, please?

308
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,570
But it's too much money.

309
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,773
Oh, Daddy, I'd work
like a slave for it.

310
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:04,174
Please?

311
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,444
The sound you now hear
is your little baby girl,

312
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,146
the one you'd do anything for.

313
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,180
I would do anything
for her, but...

314
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:13,283
Russ, it is Francie's
birthday next month.

315
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:17,854
Oh, for my birthday!
Would that ever be cool!

316
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,760
He's going to do it!

317
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,662
Oh, he's going to do it!

318
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,530
Oh, you doll, you!

319
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,698
Oh, Daddy,
you've made me so happy!

320
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,466
Honest to goodness, Mama,

321
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,067
this surfboard
is a gilt-edge guarantee

322
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,570
for a summer of sheer happiness.

323
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,005
Oh, I'm not so sure, darling,

324
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,608
that there are such guarantees.

325
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,368
Hi!

326
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:11,908
Uh, remember me?
My name is Francie.

327
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,612
Aw, Kahuna...

328
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,514
Hi, Francie.

329
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:17,847
Hi.

330
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,516
Don't mind him.
He's a quiet one.

331
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:23,720
Oh, it's just what Moondoggie
fished out yesterday.

332
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,721
I was looking for Stinky.

333
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,856
I... I got the money
for my board.

334
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,726
Gosh, I can hardly wait
to try it out.

335
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,027
You done much surfing?

336
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:34,698
Uh, no, not too much.

337
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,666
Yesterday was my first.

338
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,101
Boy, was it ever exciting!

339
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,570
It was like nothing
I ever felt before!

340
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,572
Whoop! We're on an elevator
headed for the sky.

341
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:46,643
And then, zoom! Speeding across
the ocean, on top of the world!

342
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,378
It was the ultimate!

343
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,779
The big kick, huh?

344
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,081
Sounds like you're a goner, kid.

345
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,650
And what a way to go.

346
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,051
Coming out, Kahuna?

347
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:57,187
Naw, I got to brew up
my morning java first.

348
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,522
Oh, let me do it. I'm a
wizard in the kitchen,

349
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:02,626
and, well, besides, I have
to wait for Stinky, anyway.

350
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:06,229
All right, wizard,
the job's yours.

351
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:10,166
Hey, gee, this is neat.

352
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,935
Why, somebody
could almost live here.

353
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,104
Hello, Mary.

354
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,806
We do. Flyboy and me.

355
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:17,874
When I get you back to Peru,

356
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:21,044
I'm going to dump you with the
rest of your feathered relatives.

357
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,512
You're going to Peru?

358
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,047
And I mean it.

359
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:24,648
What?

360
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,815
You're going to Peru?

361
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,151
Yeah, either there or Hawaii.

362
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:31,755
You know, got to follow the sun.

363
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,659
You can't mean...

364
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:36,393
I'm a surf bum.

365
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,662
You know, ride the waves,
eat, sleep,

366
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:41,197
not a care in the world.

367
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,932
Here...

368
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,970
You hear that?

369
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,706
The sea left its whisper
in there.

370
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:53,276
That's the secret
to the whole thing.

371
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,247
Well... well, how do...

372
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,816
Excuse me,
I... I don't mean to be nosy.

373
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,483
Who's nosy?

374
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,320
What do you want to know,
angel? My life's an open book.

375
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,056
Well, it... it may be
awfully naive of me,

376
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,625
but when do you work?

377
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,593
Oh, yeah, well,
I tried that once,

378
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,129
but there were too many hours
and rules and regulations.

379
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:17,067
Nobody ever consulted me about
what flight I was in the mood for.

380
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,935
You mean, the Air Force?

381
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:19,502
Yeah.

382
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:23,239
When that Korean bit was over, I knew there
was one thing I didn't want in life...

383
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:24,407
chains.

384
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,009
And the others?

385
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,278
They're all bums too?

386
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,879
No...

387
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:34,584
No...
No, they just like to surf.

388
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:59,242
For them, it's a summer romance.

389
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:02,379
For me,
it's a full-time passion.

390
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,913
What'll happen to your future?

391
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:08,918
I mean, doesn't everybody have
to have a goal or something?

392
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,620
Who said?

393
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,458
There's your answer, little one.

394
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,594
"Who said."

395
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:21,498
The swells are getting pretty big.
I'll see you later.

396
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,737
Come on.

397
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,589
Hi! How's the water?

398
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,991
Gee, you look neat.

399
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:33,763
Hello, Francie.

400
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,965
How's it going?

401
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,469
I say, there's nothing like
this in England, you know.

402
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,471
There'll always be
a Santa Monica.

403
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,305
Hey, now. Hey, what's up?

404
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,641
How about that tunnel back there.
Did you see it, huh?

405
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,710
It was a beauty,
a great piece of chop.

406
00:25:48,646 --> 00:25:49,646
Francie...

407
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,814
have you met the whole crew yet?

408
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,049
Waikiki. Aloha.

409
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,918
You know Stinky, of course...

410
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,086
fastest parking attendant
West of the Rockies.

411
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,288
When he works. Very funny.

412
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,123
Yeah, who works
when the surf's good.

413
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:04,727
That's Lord Byron. The beard
means he digs existentialism.

414
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,430
Hot Shot, big fraternity man,

415
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:08,865
and Lover Boy.

416
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:11,167
He'll tell you all about himself.
He sure will.

417
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,368
Oh, hey, hey, hey!

418
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,770
Oh, oh, oh! Watch it!

419
00:26:14,905 --> 00:26:15,905
And Moondoggie,

420
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:16,639
your heroic lifesaver.

421
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,141
Oh, we're all friends.

422
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,344
Please, no tourists, Kahuna.

423
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:22,445
Hey, Francie's no tourist.

424
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:25,715
She's got a real yen
to pick up on surfing.

425
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,117
That gidget?

426
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,187
A gidget.

427
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,488
Hey, wait a minute, fellows.

428
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,024
Let me in on the gag too, huh?

429
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:37,794
You see, it's arrived
at through osmosis.

430
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:38,361
Yeah.

431
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:41,331
Girl and midget... a gidget.

432
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:44,033
All right, let's have
a little respect

433
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,568
for a cash customer, huh?

434
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,636
Cash customer?

435
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:47,570
Cash?

436
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:48,938
You bring the moolah?

437
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,472
Money?

438
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,641
Pounds? Pounds? Money?

439
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,477
Oh, you nice wahine.

440
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,913
Money gidget bringer.

441
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,183
What a bundle.

442
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:03,252
Ah, beautiful.

443
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:05,088
Yeah, and warm.

444
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:05,788
Crazy, crazy.

445
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,156
Hey, fellows,
we're eating again.

446
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,859
Aren't we? Aren't we,
Stinky, eating? Huh?

447
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:10,660
Yeah, I guess.

448
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:11,728
You guess. You sure do.

449
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:12,795
Hey, maybe we
could let the Gidget

450
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,365
run delivery service
from the hot dog stand.

451
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,899
Boolee! Boolee.

452
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,201
Oh, I'd be glad to!

453
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,370
Gee, fellows, this is
the way I like it,

454
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,938
the way I always like it.

455
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,572
How's that, angel?

456
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:26,275
Oh, you know, just kids horsing
around, having picnics.

457
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:27,043
Easygoing stuff.

458
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,745
None of that
technique business for me.

459
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:29,545
I'll be right back.

460
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:31,147
Yeah, get me a hot dog
with the works, honey!

461
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,582
Hey, get me a taco!

462
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,651
I'll have a hamburger
with chips.

463
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,352
Any kind of taco fine for me.

464
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:39,589
Get me one of each, and get
something for yourself...

465
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,190
Hey, Kahuna,

466
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:44,260
what are we starting,
a baby farm here?

467
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,029
Relax, man.

468
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,532
It's like this, man...

469
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,135
if you're really
serious about making it

470
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,636
as a full-time
surf bum like me...

471
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:54,404
Oh, you know I am.

472
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:57,173
Well, then you got to learn
to take what you can get.

473
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,009
Here, I found
these on the floor.

474
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,912
I guess they fell
out of your pocket.

475
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:06,883
As long as it was
nothing important.

476
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:11,154
Let's not kid, huh? You know
it was my allowance check.

477
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:12,989
Okay, so maybe you think I
shouldn't have torn it up.

478
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,425
Look, kid, you've got
no obligations to me.

479
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,660
I admit it's been getting a
little hungry around here,

480
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:19,996
but you know the code...
Live and let live.

481
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:23,399
Well, you know
I buy that, Kahuna.

482
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,968
It's not that.

483
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,472
It's my old man.

484
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:30,707
He started out on a shoestring

485
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,676
and worked his way up
to be a big wheel.

486
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,245
Yeah...

487
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:38,481
I mean, how is a guy
to measure up

488
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,550
to someone like him?

489
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,653
I just got to walk out. Quit.

490
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:46,055
Only, you see,
it's got to be a clean break.

491
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:49,759
It just wouldn't smell right
if I kept taking handouts.

492
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,961
Yeah...

493
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:54,931
Yeah.

494
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:56,466
Hey, chow!

495
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:31,267
Those hogs. Somebody must
have taken seconds. Here.

496
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,034
Thanks, I'm not hungry.

497
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,736
Oh, but you've got to.
It's delicious.

498
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:36,439
Come on. Cut it out, will you?

499
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:38,241
I'm no cruddy sponger.

500
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:40,543
Well, I should hope not.

501
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,613
Oh, look, I didn't pay
for the eats,

502
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,414
just for the board, remember?

503
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,483
I... I guess Stinky did it.

504
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,652
Come on, try it.

505
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:55,658
And anyway, what if I had?

506
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,628
Gosh, I owe you my life.

507
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,630
Forget it, will you?

508
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:04,267
The way we see it around
here, the Kahuna and me,

509
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:07,503
nobody owes anybody anything.

510
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:08,371
Not if they play it smart.

511
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:11,340
Not if they don't let
themselves get involved.

512
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,344
Why don't you
run along home, kid?

513
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:17,847
Boy, are you a grouch.

514
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,790
Hey, kid.

515
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:28,891
It's kind of waterlogged.

516
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:30,159
Yeah, but courtesy of the house,

517
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,328
we throw in a free lesson.

518
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:32,829
Here.

519
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,463
Come on, doll,
follow your coach.

520
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:37,466
Hey, this is
the ultimate!

521
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,115
There you go.
There you are, honey.

522
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:55,785
Flat as a pancake, huh?

523
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,053
Well, almost, anyway.

524
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:57,753
Well, now, let me see,

525
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:00,189
can I... can I make you
a little more comfortable?

526
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,791
No, this is fine.

527
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,693
Fine? Fine? Oh, all right. Yeah.

528
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,794
Let me see, it's very simple.

529
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,395
All you do is dig in,
push yourself forward...

530
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:09,465
Just keep yourself in the
middle of the board. That's it.

531
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,471
That's it,
keep pushing forward, huh.

532
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:19,742
Hey, come on,
you're tickling me.

533
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:27,650
He'll coach her.

534
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,522
Just a minute
till I hop on here.

535
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,929
There we go.

536
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,831
Cozy, huh?

537
00:31:42,132 --> 00:31:43,132
Do you like it?

538
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:45,768
Yeah, it's all right,
but what do I do now?

539
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,304
No hurry, just got to
get used to the feel.

540
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:49,839
Hey!

541
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:55,678
Huh. It's pretty good
for the first time, huh?

542
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,247
Now I'll take her in
a little deeper.

543
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,348
She's in deep enough already.

544
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,150
You've had it, coach. Dissolve.

545
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:01,884
We'll, get him.

546
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:03,819
Come on, Gidge. Let's go out
and have little fun, huh?

547
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:07,089
Oh, no. Thanks all the same.

548
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,658
So who needs it.

549
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,960
Come on, Gidget.

550
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:18,868
Oh, brother, that guy's glands
must be working overtime.

551
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,568
Listen, Gidge,

552
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,438
the kind of lessons you'll pick
up around here aren't for you.

553
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,440
So if you know what's good for
you, you'll take your board

554
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:28,177
and run along like
a good little girl, huh?

555
00:32:40,457 --> 00:32:41,457
Francie!

556
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,894
Shut off that infernal racket.

557
00:32:45,862 --> 00:32:46,862
Infernal racket...

558
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:50,132
No wonder they call them
the Lost Generation.

559
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,301
Glad you had such a
good time at the beach.

560
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,704
Oh, yeah, it was creamy.

561
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:57,139
Tell me about it.
I'd like to hear.

562
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,507
What are these boys like?

563
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,176
Oh gosh, they're all nice boys.

564
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:03,012
You know, the Kahuna,
he's promised to coach me.

565
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,414
Kahuna, that's a boy's name?

566
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,516
Yeah, well, he's an older boy.

567
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:09,852
In Hawaiian,
it means, "Big chief".

568
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:10,519
Hmm...

569
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:13,255
and is he the one you like best?

570
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:14,690
Best?

571
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:19,462
Well, yeah, I guess so.
I mean, they're all nice guys.

572
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,565
Well, that's good.

573
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,767
All except one.

574
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,170
Mom? Hmm?

575
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,940
There's something
I have to ask you.

576
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:31,640
Shoot.

577
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:35,778
Well, do you find that there's
anything weird about me?

578
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,412
Francie...

579
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,347
Mom, I mean, gee, I'm serious.

580
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,382
Here I am, almost 17,

581
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:42,785
the same age as Nan
and the rest of them.

582
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,754
Why don't I like dates?

583
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,623
Darling, you like boys,
don't you?

584
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:48,090
Well, sure.

585
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:51,827
I mean, well,
boys are the most fun, but...

586
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,162
well...

587
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,063
I mean, I just can't stand

588
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:56,432
when they start smooching
and pawing and...

589
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:57,566
Well, level with me, Mom,

590
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:00,469
doesn't that kind of stuff
make your skin crawl?

591
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,471
Well, it would depend on who.

592
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:05,274
Oh, there it is then,
it proves it.

593
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:05,808
I am different.

594
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,843
Oh, sweetheart,
please believe me,

595
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:10,112
the only difference between
you and your friends

596
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:12,715
is you're not a... a manhunter.

597
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:16,752
You're too genuine to pretend
anything you don't feel yet.

598
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:17,586
Yet?

599
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:19,155
Someday, darling, you will.

600
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:23,292
It'll all be different then because
you'll feel something magic,

601
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:26,529
like little bells
ringing in your heart.

602
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,732
Oh, gee, you make it sound
real nice,

603
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,668
but are you sure
that's gonna happen to me?

604
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,003
I'm positive.

605
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,171
Huh. Well, that's a relief.

606
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,973
You know, I almost saw myself
pickled in a jar at Harvard.

607
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:40,443
Oh, well, stop worrying.

608
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:44,080
Yeah, but when, and I mean,
how am I going to know what...

609
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:44,713
what boy, or...

610
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,582
When it's the real thing,
you'll know it,

611
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:51,353
as surely as if you'd been hit
on the head with a sledgehammer.

612
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,522
Good night, dear.

613
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,491
Good night.

614
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,660
Thank you.

615
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:12,475
It probably won't happen to me
before I'm middle-aged.

616
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,683
Oh, no. Back again?

617
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:21,684
Any objections?

618
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,252
You want me to reel off
the whole list?

619
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:24,854
Go ahead. Then I might start.

620
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:28,023
Better step on it, Moondoggie,
before it bites you.

621
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,258
Relax.

622
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,960
I invited the Gidge to stay.

623
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,828
We can use a mascot around here.

624
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,097
Oh, well, in that case, fellows,

625
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,099
maybe we ought to initiate her.

626
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:38,267
Go ahead, initiate me.

627
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:39,768
Whoa, she's asking for it.

628
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:43,272
Hey, fellows! Let go! Hey! Hey!

629
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,044
Go on down and cut some kelp.

630
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,873
Hey, you still want
to be a member?

631
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,375
Sure! Sure...

632
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,877
Okay. Keep cutting.

633
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,353
G-gee, fellows,
this is g-great fun.

634
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,021
I'm glad you like it.

635
00:38:20,263 --> 00:38:21,263
What happened?

636
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:23,098
You got tangled in some kelp.

637
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,401
Now, take it easy, you hear.

638
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:28,103
You're still on the blue side.

639
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,407
Hey, I... I made it, didn't I?

640
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,676
I'm a real member now, huh?

641
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,010
You crazy tomboy.

642
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:38,681
Yeah, I guess
you're a member now.

643
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,516
Oh...

644
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:41,483
Are you okay?

645
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:45,854
Sure. I never felt better
in my life.

646
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:50,125
If... If I had to,

647
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:52,461
I'd... I'd do it all over again.

648
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,930
Yeah, I bet you would.

649
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:04,873
 It very well may be
She's just a baby 

650
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:08,377
 Speaking romantically 

651
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:12,948
 If that's your bad feature
I'll be the teacher 

652
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:16,719
 That's the way it's gonna be 

653
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:21,190
 Gidget is the one for me... 

654
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,227
Hey, you know...

655
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:28,731
I kind of like
being called that now.

656
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:31,266
What's that, Gidget?

657
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:39,141
 Although she's just
small fry Just about so-high 

658
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:42,511
 Gidget is the one for me 

659
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:46,215
 A regular tomboy
But dressed for a prom 

660
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:50,386
 Boy, how cute
Can one girl be? 

661
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:55,157
 Although she's not king size
Her finger is ring size 

662
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,193
 Gidget is the one for me 

663
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:02,131
 If she says she loves you 

664
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:06,468
 You can bet your boots
She loves you 

665
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:10,005
 If she says she hates you 

666
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:14,676
 That can also mean
She loves you 

667
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:19,114
 It very well may be
She's just a baby 

668
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:22,317
 Speaking romantically 

669
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:27,055
 If that's a bad feature
I'll be the teacher 

670
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:31,093
 That's the way it's gonna be 

671
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:35,264
 Gidget is the one for me 

672
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:37,866
Hey, you don't look very good.

673
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:40,969
I'd better see if I can get one
of the guys to drive you home.

674
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,738
Moondoggie?

675
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:45,741
G-gee, I don't want to be
a drag to you,

676
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:48,377
but I was thinking...

677
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:51,413
maybe you could take me home?

678
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:53,849
Well, uh, I'm...

679
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,050
Hi...

680
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:55,784
How's our mascot?

681
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,053
Oh, she'll live. What
time is it, Kahuna?

682
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,188
A little after 5:00.

683
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,156
After 5:00?
Oh, brother, I got to go.

684
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:03,425
I'll see you later.

685
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,962
What jet-propelled him
all of a sudden?

686
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:07,996
Oh, you know men.

687
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:09,398
After sunset, they get
a little restless.

688
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,168
Rumor has it Moondoggie's
got a big date tonight.

689
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:13,735
Oh...

690
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:18,740
Hey, don't tell me
that Gidget's jealous.

691
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:20,509
Who, me?

692
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,244
I never heard anything
so ridiculous...

693
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,880
Oh, just a passing impression.

694
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:26,381
Oh.

695
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:27,983
Oh...

696
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,356
Hey, baby, you really are sick.

697
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:36,225
No, I just feel like

698
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:41,296
I've been hit on the back of
the head with a sledgehammer.

699
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,439
Moondoggie...

700
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:53,575
Moondoggie...

701
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:55,577
There, there, dear.

702
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:56,612
It's just the fever.

703
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:58,814
Doctor said it was
too much sun and water.

704
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,449
Just a touch of tonsillitis,

705
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:01,583
but you'll be all right.

706
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:04,319
No, Mommy, no, it...
it's something else.

707
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:06,121
Darling, what is it?

708
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:08,390
You kept saying Moondoggie.

709
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:11,660
Well, that's it. He's the one.

710
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:12,961
Oh, Mom. It's all true,

711
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,630
just like you said about...

712
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:17,533
about a person knowing
when it happens.

713
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,302
Mom, but what does
a person do about it?

714
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:20,836
Do?

715
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,137
Darling, according to Dr. West,

716
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:24,439
you won't be doing anything
away from this room

717
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:26,241
for at least a couple of weeks.

718
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:27,309
Oh, a couple of weeks.

719
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,678
Besides, one of the advantages

720
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,446
of being a young lady is

721
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:32,681
is it's not up to you.

722
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,249
It's up to the young man.

723
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:38,387
There, now, try
and get some sleep, huh?

724
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,389
Don't worry.

725
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:51,934
Yeah, but what if the young man
doesn't know you're alive?

726
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:54,269
The young lady be darned.

727
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:58,140
I've got to figure out
a plan of attack.

728
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,775
I mean, it's...
it's perfectly obvious

729
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:02,344
that you get a man
through his own interests.

730
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:05,447
Put one foot a few
inches ahead of the other,

731
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:07,382
near the center of the board.

732
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:07,950
Yeah?

733
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:11,887
Stop forward or back to meet the
changing pitch of the wave.

734
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:15,023
Oh, boy, when I think of
all the hours I spent

735
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:17,326
cramming on math and biology...

736
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:18,093
No, I'm to blame.

737
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:21,630
That time I congratulated you
for getting straight A's?

738
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:22,331
What a friend.

739
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:25,133
You know, I... I should've
belted you one, right then.

740
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:26,101
No, no, no, it's my fault.

741
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:29,538
I should have worked at being
an "A" student in both,

742
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,439
but don't worry,

743
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,075
I've never flunked out
on a subject yet,

744
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:34,343
and by the time I shake

745
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:36,144
this crummy tonsillitis,

746
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:38,947
I'm going to be the best
female surfer in California!

747
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,749
Oh! What's happening?

748
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:42,451
She just got thrown under

749
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,119
by a 30-foot wave!

750
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:01,770
Hi.

751
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:03,772
Hi. Not bad for a beginner.

752
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:06,575
Were you really sick, or did you go
hire yourself a coach somewhere?

753
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:10,012
No, not a coach,
just some books.

754
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:10,479
Some books?

755
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,582
Oh, I boned up on a few
basic principles...

756
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:16,918
You can learn anything
from books, you know.

757
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,762
Now make a wish
and blow.

758
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,930
A wish, uh...

759
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,600
Okay...

760
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:34,936
Oh, I did it!

761
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:38,674
Oh, golly, it's beautiful.

762
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,307
Uh, where's...

763
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:41,410
where's all your friends
from the beach,

764
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:43,478
and... and where's B.L.?

765
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,181
Oh, well, B.L.
would've broken her date,

766
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:49,251
and, well, as for the crew...

767
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,919
I... I guess I'll get
them here sometime.

768
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:56,091
I mean, you know what Saturday
night means to most fellows.

769
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:56,958
Well, uh...

770
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,561
I know what it means
in the Lawrence house.

771
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:02,664
Duet time, eh, Francie-girl?

772
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:47,242
Moondoggie! Hey, wait...

773
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,748
Put her down, boys.
Set her right down.

774
00:47:01,851 --> 00:47:02,851
Crowned!

775
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:05,220
Hey! Hip, hip, hooray!

776
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:07,589
Hip, hip, hooray!

777
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,759
My turn.

778
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:13,028
That's great!

779
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,563
Whoo-hoo!

780
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,264
Oh, Moondoggie!

781
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:17,899
Hey, Joanne!

782
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:19,367
This is the kid
I was telling you about.

783
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:21,903
She's only been surfing
a little over a month.

784
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:22,571
Really?

785
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:25,640
It must be wonderful, if you
like that sort of thing.

786
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:27,409
Of course,
Moondoggie can tell you

787
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:28,510
I'm not the outdoor type.

788
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,813
Then you better get out of
the sun before you melt.

789
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:33,081
Oh, ho, ho.

790
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:34,482
Yeah, that's right. Come on.

791
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:36,418
See you at the luau, huh?

792
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:37,485
What luau? Oh, no.

793
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:39,354
You aren't gonna scare
our Gidget there. Uh-uh.

794
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,056
Honest, fellows,
I'd love a luau.

795
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,324
When is it?
Not for a couple of weeks.

796
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,659
But don't give it
another thought, baby.

797
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:45,961
But why?

798
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,462
Because it's not
a coming-out party.

799
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:48,897
And it's not a weenie-roast.

800
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:50,465
As a matter of fact, honey,

801
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:52,033
this luau is not a luau...

802
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,169
It's an orgy. Yeah.

803
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:55,237
Yeah, yeah. Ha, ha.

804
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:57,839
Will you fellows stop
treating me like an infant?

805
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:58,406
Oh...

806
00:47:58,408 --> 00:47:59,908
Forget it. You're not the type.

807
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,142
So long, Gidge.

808
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:14,222
One, two, one, two,
one, two, one, two,

809
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,958
one, two, one, two,

810
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,463
one, two, one, two, one, two,

811
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:24,566
one, two, one, two...

812
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,200
Oh, I'm exhausted.

813
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:28,303
Oh, come on. Don't
give up so easily.

814
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:28,837
What's the use?

815
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,572
Well, let's see how much
progress we've made.

816
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,808
Oh, it'll take forever
to add even an inch,

817
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,278
and the luau's
only 10 days away.

818
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,413
If I want to be the type
of girl to get invited,

819
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,882
I have to think
of something faster.

820
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:43,518
Francie, I've told you,
there's only one way.

821
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,319
Oh, I just couldn't.

822
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:47,622
I mean, I'd feel like
a man with a toupee.

823
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:49,224
Oh, no.

824
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,560
Gee, all my life,

825
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:55,363
I've found the answer
to all my problems

826
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:57,365
in these books,

827
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:59,301
but who wants to
solve their love life

828
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:02,170
with poison or a dagger?

829
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:07,075
Gee, if I could only
make Moondoggie jealous.

830
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:08,476
Jealous of who?

831
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:09,110
Whom.

832
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:12,514
Well, gee, not any of the
high school creeps I know.

833
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:15,250
Man, would I give
a tidy sum to be...

834
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:15,917
I've got it!

835
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:19,854
How to get to the luau
and make him jealous!

836
00:49:20,156 --> 00:49:21,156
20 bucks?

837
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:22,524
Just to take you to a luau?

838
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:24,259
No, I told you,
not just to take me.

839
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,494
You've got pretend like
you're real gone over me.

840
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:28,029
You know, give me the mad rush.

841
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:30,365
Hey, who is this guy
you're out to turn green?

842
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,033
Oh... no.

843
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:35,170
Well, I don't know. It just
sounds like easy money, but...

844
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:37,906
I kind of had some plans
of my own at that luau.

845
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:39,774
Just till midnight.

846
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:41,509
Well...

847
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,116
Just till midnight, huh?

848
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:49,284
Okay, it's a deal.

849
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:50,352
Oh, great.

850
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:52,854
But picking you up first,
that's extra for gas.

851
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:56,191
Oh, that's the last
of my allowance again.

852
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:57,625
Hey, couldn't we compromise,

853
00:49:57,627 --> 00:49:58,893
you know, meet somewhere?

854
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:03,298
Well, you know the espresso
cafe on Wilshire, Portofino?

855
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,399
Uh-huh. Yeah, there.

856
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:05,600
A week from Saturday night.

857
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:08,069
Yeah, but you got to square
it with the Kahuna first.

858
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:10,805
Oh, don't worry, I will.

859
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:23,985
Kahuna, I want
to come to that luau.

860
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:25,253
Baby-doll, what is it with you?

861
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:26,388
Don't you ever give up?

862
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:28,189
Well, not when I want something.

863
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,157
Well, it's like anything,

864
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:30,458
you want it bad enough,
you work for it,

865
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:34,396
and right now what I want more than
anything else in the whole wide world

866
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:35,764
is to go to that luau!

867
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:36,798
Well, Kahuna, you know yourself,

868
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,834
it's the bang-up finish
to the whole summer!

869
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:40,735
Why, it's like graduation day.

870
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:42,237
I mean, it's the ultimate!

871
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,338
Oh, Gidget, Gidget, Gidget...

872
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,140
Besides, what's it
to the great Kahuna

873
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:46,741
whether I'm the type or not.

874
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:47,575
You said it yourself,

875
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:51,112
the code is,
"Live and let live."

876
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:54,215
Oh, it's no skin off
my nose what you do,

877
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,750
but the rest of the crew
might not like it.

878
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:56,951
Oh, Kahuna, they won't care,

879
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:58,820
not if you say it's all right,

880
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:00,989
and besides, I've already
got an escort, and...

881
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,957
oh, I'll bring piles of food...

882
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:05,026
piles and piles of food.

883
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:06,394
We've got more stuff
in our freezer

884
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:09,097
that's practically
forgotten, and...

885
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:13,935
and if you ever tasted
my mom's cheesecake...

886
00:51:16,872 --> 00:51:17,872
All right.

887
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:21,910
A man's got to look after
his own stomach.

888
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:27,115
You got any steaks
in that freezer?

889
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:28,983
I'll do my best.

890
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:30,552
Gee, Kahuna, I can't
thank you enough.

891
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:34,689
You just don't know
what it means to me to...

892
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:50,905
Gee, I'm sorry, Kahuna.

893
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:53,975
I know Flyboy was all you had.

894
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,665
Kahuna...

895
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,401
please don't feel too bad.

896
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,403
What? The bird?

897
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:57,438
Hell, when I get down to Peru,

898
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,041
I'll get me a bird that treats
me with a little respect.

899
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:04,512
Respect. That... That's terribly
important to you, isn't it?

900
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:05,914
What?

901
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:09,250
I mean, all the fellows
around here respect you.

902
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:10,252
Well, because, you...

903
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:12,287
you're a person who knows
what he wants to do

904
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:13,855
and goes ahead and does it.

905
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,423
You're so self-sufficient.

906
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:18,359
You don't need anybody.

907
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,629
Well, n-now, take me.

908
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:22,564
I... I couldn't live that way

909
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:25,466
because, well, gee,
I'd get too lonely.

910
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:28,670
Of course, if I were
to lose my only family,

911
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:30,238
or... or at the end
of every summer,

912
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,139
just when I'd get settled,

913
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:34,609
I had to move on and leave
all my new friends...

914
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:37,245
Gosh, if I had a whole
lifetime of that,

915
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:39,147
and well, I'd about die.

916
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:42,951
Oh, but of course,
you're different.

917
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,452
Yeah.

918
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:45,286
Oh, you are.

919
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:46,421
I mean, you'd have to be

920
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:47,822
to be able to turn your back

921
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,591
on the way everybody else lives.

922
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:51,960
Well, I mean,
everybody in life is...

923
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:55,897
is working for some
sort of a goal, or...

924
00:53:55,899 --> 00:54:00,101
well, I mean, I mean,
you don't have a goal or...

925
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:02,470
Oh, Kahuna, I'm sorry.

926
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:04,239
What's there to be sorry about?

927
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,941
I told you myself,
I'm a surf bum.

928
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:08,643
There's nothing
to be sorry about.

929
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:10,878
No, of course not.

930
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:17,352
Kahuna?

931
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:22,156
Kahuna... could I ask you

932
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:25,460
just one crazy question?

933
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:28,730
Yeah.

934
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:30,531
I mean, I understand
how you said in the war

935
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:33,368
you got sick of all
the rules and regulations,

936
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:34,636
and, well, about
this dream you had

937
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:37,171
that when you got loose
there'd be no more chains,

938
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:38,940
nothing but a free life.

939
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,608
Is that right?

940
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:41,409
That's right.

941
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:42,877
That's what you said then?

942
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:45,613
That's right. That's
what the man said, he...

943
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:46,648
Only what if you could go back

944
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,182
to that time in your life,

945
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:49,350
if... if something happened,

946
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:53,187
and you could choose
all over again?

947
00:54:55,691 --> 00:54:56,691
If I could what?

948
00:54:56,693 --> 00:55:00,161
If you could choose
all over again.

949
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:09,370
Well, I said it was
a crazy question.

950
00:55:11,774 --> 00:55:12,774
Cheer up, angel.

951
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:17,045
Don't you know that frowning is
bad for the face, beautiful?

952
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:20,882
Besides, you're going
to the luau.

953
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:22,083
Oh, yeah, the luau.

954
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:22,884
Gee, Kahuna, thanks.

955
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:26,054
Thanks a lot. Thanks loads.

956
00:56:07,596 --> 00:56:08,596
Hey, man.

957
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:11,366
Oh, boy, can't you
just feel it in the air?

958
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,567
Feel what?

959
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:13,334
The end of summer.

960
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:15,436
Gee, with the guys off
signing up for fall semester,

961
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:18,439
the beach is half deserted
already.

962
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:19,674
Oh, I tell you,

963
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:23,444
I can hardly wait
till we hop that freighter.

964
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:25,346
How soon...

965
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:28,549
Hey, what's the matter?

966
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:31,018
Who said anything
was the matter?

967
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:33,521
Well, not me.

968
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,456
No, sir.

969
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:37,925
It's just like
I wrote my old man,

970
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:40,962
I'm not going back to school.

971
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:44,766
Right now is the whole
turning point of my life.

972
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:48,870
Here, you want to read it?

973
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:54,208
Well, why should you.
It's my problem.

974
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:55,710
That's right.

975
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:57,945
It's your problem.

976
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:00,381
Look, it's okay.

977
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:03,684
I... I got it handled.
You don't need to worry.

978
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:09,090
Look, all I'm thinking about is getting
on our way to places we'll see.

979
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:09,857
Yeah.

980
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:11,926
Yeah, the Island of Kauai...

981
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:12,693
see the very place

982
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:16,397
where the natives presented
this to the great Kahuna.

983
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:18,366
Presented it?

984
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:21,169
I bought it in Acapulco
for 20 cruddy pesos.

985
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:22,537
You better start
learning, Moondoggie,

986
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:26,007
there's a price tag
on everything.

987
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:31,212
Well, so what. You bought it.

988
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:34,182
Look, I can take a gag.

989
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:36,451
You weren't worried?

990
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,351
I mean, you don't have to worry

991
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:41,055
anything's gonna change
my mind about going now.

992
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:43,491
I'm going, all right.

993
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,160
Yes, sir, I'm going.

994
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:52,400
Boy, will my father be surprised
to see he's not the only one.

995
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:53,701
The only what?

996
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:56,471
Oh, I told you, a wheel.

997
00:57:57,106 --> 00:58:00,508
Now, wait till he finds out
about me...

998
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:01,876
carving out a life for myself,

999
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:03,544
moving around
this whole cockeyed hemisphere

1000
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:07,081
with guys around me
treating me like a king,

1001
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:09,217
like you, Kahuna.

1002
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:10,885
Yeah.

1003
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:14,489
Boy, there's a funny bit.

1004
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:18,860
You know, about the only thing
my father's afraid of is water.

1005
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,465
Hey, where are you going?

1006
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:28,536
Tell Waikiki I borrowed
his car to go into town.

1007
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:30,471
What's she doing upstairs?

1008
00:58:30,473 --> 00:58:32,573
I don't know, dear.

1009
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,174
Francie!

1010
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:36,777
Francie, Saturday night,
concert time!

1011
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:37,845
What's all this?

1012
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,380
Francie, you didn't tell us.

1013
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:41,482
Tonight must be special.

1014
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:43,885
Well, uh, so long, Fran.

1015
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:44,685
I'll see you later.

1016
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:48,222
So long, B.L.,
and thanks for everything.

1017
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,091
Well, I... I guess I
should have told you,

1018
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:51,826
but I can't make it tonight.

1019
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:53,427
You see, the fellows
down at the beach

1020
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:56,864
are giving a big... a big party.

1021
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:59,700
Isn't that wonderful, Russell?

1022
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:01,903
Well...

1023
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:03,804
Well, what time
is the lucky young man

1024
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:06,340
going to pick up
his glamorous date?

1025
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:09,477
Oh, uh, I'm not being picked up.

1026
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:11,579
You see,
he's meeting me somewhere.

1027
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:12,747
Hold it.

1028
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:15,683
Daddy, I'm really very late.

1029
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:17,118
Obviously, there's some mistake.

1030
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,854
A gentleman, Francie, always
picks up the young lady...

1031
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:22,757
Well, this gentleman
is different.

1032
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:24,625
Well, let him get
undifferent fast.

1033
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:27,562
Either you call him up and tell
him to come here and pick you up,

1034
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,196
or forget about the whole thing.

1035
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:30,097
Forget it? Yes, forget it.

1036
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:34,235
Mother, are you going to let Daddy
stand there and ruin the whole thing?

1037
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:36,404
Francie, a boy only thinks
more of you if you...

1038
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:40,074
I worked like a dog to get
even invited to this brawl!

1039
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:43,778
Am I to understand that a daughter
of mine would even think of going

1040
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:44,946
to a place
that she was unwelcome?

1041
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:48,449
Go ahead! Go ahead and say all
the horrible things you like,

1042
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:50,351
but I'm not changing my mind!

1043
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:51,052
Oh, Francie,

1044
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:52,987
your father just
loves you too much

1045
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:56,424
to let anyone
treat you shabbily.

1046
00:59:56,725 --> 00:59:57,725
Baby...

1047
00:59:57,727 --> 00:59:59,160
the last thing in
the world I want to do

1048
00:59:59,162 --> 01:00:01,862
is make my little girl unhappy.

1049
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:02,830
Yes. There...

1050
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:06,367
You look prettier without tears.

1051
01:00:06,636 --> 01:00:08,069
Oh, Pop, Mama, I'm sorry.

1052
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:10,605
I don't mean to yell,
or... or be fresh, or...

1053
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,006
All right...

1054
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:13,975
It's all over now.

1055
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:16,077
After all, all I ask
is to make sure

1056
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:20,915
that the boys my little girl
goes out with are worthy of her.

1057
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:22,416
Take a boy like
Jeffrey Matthews' son...

1058
01:00:22,418 --> 01:00:26,120
Oh, I am not interested
in Jeffrey Matthews' son

1059
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,255
or his nephew or his dog!

1060
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:29,023
Francie!

1061
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:30,524
I just want to go,
and I'm going!

1062
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:34,061
In the name of heavens,
what is this?

1063
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:36,530
Well, if you must
know, it's a bribe.

1064
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:38,065
That's how anxious
all the fellows are

1065
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:40,267
to take out your
darling daughter.

1066
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:42,069
Dorothy... Dorothy.

1067
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:43,104
Francie, really.

1068
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:44,071
Oh, that's only the half of it.

1069
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:47,975
To get this date tonight,
I had to fork over cold cash.

1070
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:51,779
What kind of insanity has
taken hold of this family?

1071
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:53,781
Cold cash, legs of lamb.

1072
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:58,219
Do you think this is what the
young man of today wants?

1073
01:00:58,221 --> 01:00:59,286
You're so right.

1074
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:02,056
The man I'm after sure
does want something else,

1075
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:05,092
and I'll see he gets it!

1076
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:09,363
Dorothy, I tell you,

1077
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:12,667
unless you take that
daughter of yours in hand,

1078
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:13,234
I'm going to...

1079
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:16,303
Russ, she's driving away!

1080
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:17,938
She's what?

1081
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,707
Ooh, ooh!

1082
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:22,743
She can't. She can't.
I won't let her.

1083
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:25,312
I'm going lock her in her room.

1084
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:37,224
Hey, Gidge...

1085
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:40,828
Gee, you look dressed to kill.

1086
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:42,129
Thanks.

1087
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:43,297
Who are you out to slaughter?
Huh?

1088
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:46,200
I said, you look like you're
out to hook some guy.

1089
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:49,537
Oh, no, I'm just
waiting for my date.

1090
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,539
Okay if I wait with you?

1091
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,674
Suit yourself.

1092
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:57,878
Where's Joanne?

1093
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,720
I had to stand her up tonight.
I'm working.

1094
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:04,085
You're not coming to the luau?

1095
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,188
Oh, sure, I'll be there.

1096
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,459
That's where my job takes me.

1097
01:02:13,495 --> 01:02:14,495
You guessed it.

1098
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:15,930
Old Hot Shot got tied up
till midnight,

1099
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:19,100
so I've taken over the...
assignment.

1100
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:20,968
You have?

1101
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:24,405
Oh... Oh, but... but you can't.

1102
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:26,640
Why?

1103
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:28,175
Why?

1104
01:02:28,310 --> 01:02:29,310
Well, for crying out...

1105
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:32,646
Do you know who that stoop Hot
Shot had lined up for the job?

1106
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:34,014
Lover Boy!

1107
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:35,883
A lady wrestler wouldn't be
safe with that octopus,

1108
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:38,219
let alone a babe
in arms like you.

1109
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:42,690
Oh, well, thank you very much,
but I can take care of myself.

1110
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:45,059
Besides, what's it to you?

1111
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:47,828
To me? Nothing.
Why should it be?

1112
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,230
Just a good paying job,

1113
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:51,465
and besides, with the plans
I've got lined up...

1114
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:54,869
I could use some easy cash.

1115
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:55,302
I see.

1116
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:59,640
Relax. Listen, I can play Romeo
as well as Hot Shot any time.

1117
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:02,109
You trust old Moondoggie, baby.

1118
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:03,778
I'll fake it fine.

1119
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,445
But, I...

1120
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,381
Look, it's okay. Hot Shot
briefed me on the setup.

1121
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:09,717
You want to get a certain
guy jealous, right?

1122
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:13,888
You don't have to tell me who
it is till after we get there.

1123
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,589
Come on.

1124
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:35,242
 Got a cute little girl
And I call her Cinderella 

1125
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:36,844
 I'm so in love with her 

1126
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:39,346
 I'm the lucky guy
That she calls her fellow 

1127
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:41,248
 And she always will I'm sure 

1128
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,150
 We can dance all night
At the record-hop 

1129
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:45,653
 Dance all night Up to 12:00 

1130
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:46,720
 We can spend the night
Jumping 

1131
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:47,822
 But my head would be
A-thumping 

1132
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,623
 If I didn't get her home
On time 

1133
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,692
 I'd lose my love sublime 

1134
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:54,161
 And maybe this head of mine 

1135
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:04,438
 I'm her own Prince Charming
And her beauty's so alarming 

1136
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,873
 When I pick her up at 8 

1137
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:08,809
 Cinderella's so fine
And she's always mine 

1138
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:10,477
 For a regular weekend date 

1139
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:12,546
 She's real clean
When she climbs aboard 

1140
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:14,582
 Her royal coach
My hopped-up Ford 

1141
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:16,717
 Then away we fly
Cinderella and I 

1142
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:18,552
 To our favorite
Drive-in show 

1143
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:20,955
 And at 12:00 It's home we go 

1144
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:23,490
 But we drive home very slow 

1145
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:26,393
 Listening to the radio 

1146
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:45,246
 In the book it says
That the clock struck 12:00 

1147
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:46,780
 And the magic of her beauty
Was gone 

1148
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:49,516
 Well, the girls compare
But it stops right there 

1149
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:51,685
 'Cause my Cinderella's magic
Goes on 

1150
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:53,387
 I may have to lose her
At 12:00 

1151
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:55,823
 But my Cinderella's beauty
Won't ever stop 

1152
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:57,758
 If you want to see
She's the one with me 

1153
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,994
 She's the one
That makes my life complete 

1154
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:02,329
 She's pretty and soft
And sweet 

1155
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:04,398
 How can anyone be so neat? 

1156
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,468
 Mm-hmm, mm, mm, mm... 

1157
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:41,535
It looks like every surfer from
here to San Onofre turned up.

1158
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:46,473
Hundred to one, they never
set foot in the ocean.

1159
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:05,059
Hey, Gidget, where's that steak?

1160
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:09,196
Oh, that's all right, honey.
Go have a ball.

1161
01:06:40,629 --> 01:06:43,664
All right, do you
want to spill it now?

1162
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,935
Who's the poor innocent joker

1163
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:50,070
you're out to hook?

1164
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:52,272
Do you have ask?

1165
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:54,508
Well, let's say
I can make a guess,

1166
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:57,077
but anyway, I've got a part
to play, haven't I?

1167
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,513
Well, boy, I just hope
you're a better actor

1168
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:01,982
than student of human nature.

1169
01:07:01,984 --> 01:07:03,450
What?

1170
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:04,218
Practically any fool

1171
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:06,286
could have seen,
the whole summer long,

1172
01:07:06,288 --> 01:07:08,655
the one I'm gone on.

1173
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,030
Kahuna, of course.

1174
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,097
Kahuna?

1175
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:18,599
Well, who else?

1176
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:21,969
Why, you must be kidding.
He's twice your age.

1177
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:24,471
Oh, I know,
Oedipus and all that.

1178
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:27,307
It's called a father complex.

1179
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:30,411
Only, the way I feel
about Kahuna...

1180
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:33,280
well, it's just not daughterly.

1181
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:36,650
You sure could've fooled me.

1182
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:41,355
Nobody can help you
make him jealous.

1183
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:43,490
Take it from me.
I know the Kahuna.

1184
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:45,626
Look, you weren't hired
for advice.

1185
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:50,964
Now, do you want the job, or do
I have to find someone else?

1186
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:56,837
What'll the boss lady
have first?

1187
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:08,082
Well, I-I-I guess we could
begin by holding hands.

1188
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:15,456
All right, what next?

1189
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,560
Well, all we need to do
for a while,

1190
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:20,894
till Kahuna takes notice,

1191
01:08:20,896 --> 01:08:24,765
is pretend like we're mad
for each other.

1192
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:26,233
On the surface only, of course.

1193
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:30,104
Oh, yeah, on the surface
only, of course.

1194
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:34,174
The Gidget stuck
on the great Kahuna...

1195
01:08:34,176 --> 01:08:38,078
Well, I'm no different
from any of them...

1196
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,680
except for one thing.

1197
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:40,948
Understatement of the year.

1198
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,750
Look, when I make up my mind
to get something, I get it.

1199
01:08:43,752 --> 01:08:47,621
I mean it. I'd do
anything to get Kahuna.

1200
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:49,156
Now, Gidge, you listen to me.

1201
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:53,427
I mean, as... as a friend, I've
got to straighten you out.

1202
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:57,064
Kahuna's okay, I suppose,
but for a kid like you...

1203
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:58,599
Yes?

1204
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:05,405
Well, uh, don't you find the
Kahuna on the lazy side?

1205
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:08,475
Love makes room for faults.

1206
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:10,711
Anyway, I have hopes
for the Kahuna.

1207
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:13,580
He could make something
of his life.

1208
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:16,083
Oh, boy, now, that is hilarious.

1209
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:20,120
And what makes you such
an authority on Kahuna?

1210
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:23,557
Because he and I
are two of a kind.

1211
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:28,795
Aw, Gidge...

1212
01:09:28,797 --> 01:09:32,132
Look, what I said, it's...
it's nothing personal.

1213
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:36,770
I mean, a girl like you...

1214
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:40,107
you're a real responsibility.

1215
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:44,745
You take a guy who believes
in no strings attached,

1216
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:47,247
a guy like me, even...

1217
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:50,217
I mean, if I...

1218
01:09:51,086 --> 01:09:54,855
if I were ever to,
uh, to let myself go...

1219
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:56,390
Yes?

1220
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:02,029
Well, say, for example,

1221
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:05,499
right now, right this minute...

1222
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:10,237
I mean, if this... if this
weren't just a job for pay...

1223
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:15,042
Um, could you put them back?

1224
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,077
I mean, only because
I think Kahuna's looking,

1225
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:22,516
and we could make it look
real, couldn't we?

1226
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:25,118
Sure.

1227
01:10:32,527 --> 01:10:33,527
Is he looking now?

1228
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:35,729
Mm, I'm sure of it.

1229
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:56,116
 There's no such thing As the
next best thing to love 

1230
01:10:56,885 --> 01:11:02,422
 No substitute
Or facsimile thereof 

1231
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:07,928
 Just try and do without it 

1232
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,731
 Go see how far you get 

1233
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:14,401
 Why don't we face it?
What can replace it? 

1234
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:17,137
 Nothing
They've thought of yet 

1235
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:22,676
 There's no such thing
With the very same appeal 

1236
01:11:23,512 --> 01:11:29,616
 And nothing like When you
fall in love for real 

1237
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:34,454
 Whether it be the real thing 

1238
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:36,523
 This much I'm certain of 

1239
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:43,030
 There's no such thing As the
next best thing to love 

1240
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:49,336
 There's no such thing as
The next best thing to love 

1241
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:55,909
 No substitute
Or facsimile thereof 

1242
01:11:58,213 --> 01:12:01,181
 How can we disregard it? 

1243
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:04,318
 How can we not take heed? 

1244
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,188
 Just like the inner
Craves for the dinner 

1245
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:10,390
 Love is a human need 

1246
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:15,896
 There's no such thing As the
next best thing to love 

1247
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:22,736
 Necessity gave
A cold, cold hand a glove 

1248
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:30,277
 Likewise someone to cling to
When there's a moon above 

1249
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:36,149
 There's no such thing as
The next best thing to love 

1250
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:46,893
Oi! Hey, hey! Hey, Moondoggie, baby.
Break it up.

1251
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:48,261
Come on, it's five after 12:00.

1252
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:49,796
You're off duty.

1253
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:50,997
Uh, I hope Moondoggie here

1254
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:53,600
gave you your money's worth.

1255
01:12:53,602 --> 01:12:55,202
Oh, don't worry, he...

1256
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,904
he gave a great performance.

1257
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:10,751
Hey, hey, hey.

1258
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:11,485
What is it, little one?

1259
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:14,154
What, did you... did
you lose Moondoggie?

1260
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:16,123
Yeah, I lost him, all right.

1261
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:19,726
It's about the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1262
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:20,727
Oh...

1263
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:23,764
Oh, well, I think
I'll cut out too.

1264
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:25,632
Uh, will you give me a lift?

1265
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:26,666
Sure. Where to?

1266
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:28,969
A friend of mine, uh, has
a shack down the beach.

1267
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:31,238
I figured I wouldn't get
any sleep here tonight,

1268
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,473
so I borrowed it.

1269
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:42,182
You sure you want
to leave so soon?

1270
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:44,418
Yeah, I'm sure.

1271
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:47,120
I'll wait for you in the car.

1272
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:49,089
Hey, Gidge, listen, Gidge,
about that money...

1273
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,223
Forget it. Wait a minute!

1274
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:52,225
I'm sorry, but
the Kahuna's waiting.

1275
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:53,660
We just happen to be on our way

1276
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:55,028
to a certain beach shack.

1277
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:57,998
Beach shack? Who else is going?

1278
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:58,832
Just Kahuna and me.

1279
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:02,102
Don't underestimate your
performance back there, Barrymore.

1280
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:05,272
It sold the Kahuna 100 percent,

1281
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:06,406
and you earned
every penny of it.

1282
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:09,309
Listen, maybe the Kahuna's
gone off his rocker,

1283
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:12,379
but you, on one of his
little private parties?

1284
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:13,814
Gidge, you don't know
what you're getting into.

1285
01:14:13,816 --> 01:14:16,817
Well, a girl has to
get started sometime,

1286
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:21,054
and the Kahuna has always
been a great coach.

1287
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:31,331
You've been awful quiet, angel.

1288
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:32,699
What is it? Moondoggie?

1289
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:34,468
Moondoggie? Oh...

1290
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:38,138
No, I've forgotten
all about him.

1291
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:42,609
Okay. Good night, angel.

1292
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:48,415
Uh, I suppose, uh, well,
you and he talk a lot

1293
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:50,484
about your dates
and things, huh?

1294
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:53,720
Yeah, we're pretty close. Why?

1295
01:14:53,722 --> 01:14:55,155
Anything I can do?

1296
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:55,789
Is there!

1297
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:58,725
Oh, well, no, not
about Moondoggie.

1298
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:02,529
I... I mean, golly, who
cares about him, but...

1299
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:07,033
Well, look, I was wondering...

1300
01:15:07,202 --> 01:15:09,169
Well, would it be all right

1301
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:12,239
if I came inside for a while?

1302
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:15,542
Oh, well, uh,
it's a little late,

1303
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:19,779
and I had planned on getting
to bed pretty soon.

1304
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:23,149
Um, all right, angel.

1305
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:26,520
If it's that important, come on.

1306
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:57,150
Gee... I guess
you could call this

1307
01:15:57,152 --> 01:16:00,820
ones of the major
steps in my life.

1308
01:16:11,633 --> 01:16:13,133
Make yourself at home, Gidge.

1309
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:14,100
I'll, um...

1310
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:18,004
see if I can scare up
some coffee or something.

1311
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:34,387
Look.

1312
01:16:44,665 --> 01:16:45,665
Come on.

1313
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:47,000
Oh, young man,
could you help us?

1314
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:49,536
We're looking for our
daughter, Francie Lawrence.

1315
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:52,272
Francie... No, I'm sorry...

1316
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:55,041
I believe the boys
call her Gidget.

1317
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:55,642
Oh, Gidge, yeah.

1318
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:57,043
Do you know where she is?
I don't know.

1319
01:16:57,045 --> 01:17:00,447
But Moondoggie helped himself
to my car to follow her.

1320
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:01,214
Follow her where?

1321
01:17:01,216 --> 01:17:03,516
Well, he said she went
with Kahuna to Joe's place.

1322
01:17:03,518 --> 01:17:05,719
Joe's place?
What is that, a restaurant?

1323
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:07,354
Could you tell us
how to get there?

1324
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:08,855
I don't know where it is,

1325
01:17:08,857 --> 01:17:10,156
but it's no restaurant.

1326
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:11,925
It's just some beach shack.

1327
01:17:11,927 --> 01:17:13,660
Beach shack!

1328
01:17:14,096 --> 01:17:18,365
Gee, this is a real
den of iniquity, isn't it?

1329
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:19,466
Yeah...

1330
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:22,302
You sure you wouldn't
rather have coffee?

1331
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:49,195
Well, how about it?

1332
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:50,897
How about what?

1333
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:54,034
How about one of your little
private parties?

1334
01:17:57,239 --> 01:18:00,040
How about one of my little...

1335
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:02,308
private parties?

1336
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:05,512
Are you, um...

1337
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:08,982
are you sure
that's want you want?

1338
01:18:09,384 --> 01:18:12,585
Well, well, uh,

1339
01:18:12,587 --> 01:18:16,322
I mean... well, sure.

1340
01:18:16,324 --> 01:18:19,325
That's what I came here for.

1341
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:27,167
In that case, we need
the right atmosphere, hmm?

1342
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:38,378
Nice, huh?

1343
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:40,346
Nice.

1344
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:48,254
Ah, the language of love.

1345
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:59,399
Oh, um... maybe you'd like to...

1346
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:02,535
slip into something
more comfortable, hmm?

1347
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:08,675
Oh, well... Well, no,
I don't think so, no.

1348
01:19:09,177 --> 01:19:11,177
I've got just the thing.

1349
01:19:11,179 --> 01:19:16,416
You'd be surprised what the past,
uh, tenants have left here.

1350
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:18,485
Yeah, there we are.

1351
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:22,555
Just right.

1352
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:32,532
We'll keep it right there...

1353
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:35,268
for whenever you want it.

1354
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:38,838
Outside, the ocean.

1355
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,306
Inside, you and me,

1356
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:44,277
and nothing else matters, hmm?

1357
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:46,880
Who was it that said,

1358
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:48,915
"Suspended in time and space,"

1359
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:51,684
"your lips on mine,
the soft contours of... "

1360
01:19:51,686 --> 01:19:52,886
I don't know.

1361
01:19:52,888 --> 01:19:54,420
I did.

1362
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:56,723
I just made it up.

1363
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:58,825
You inspire me.

1364
01:19:59,027 --> 01:20:00,527
Oh?

1365
01:20:02,063 --> 01:20:03,730
Hey...

1366
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:08,168
Hey, you... really are sweet.

1367
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:13,339
Oh, no, I'm just...
just a little...

1368
01:20:13,675 --> 01:20:15,408
Soft...

1369
01:20:16,444 --> 01:20:18,545
and sweet...

1370
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:22,115
and lovely,

1371
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:24,517
and cute...

1372
01:20:31,292 --> 01:20:32,292
What is it?

1373
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:36,863
It's time for you to go
home, that's what it is...

1374
01:20:36,865 --> 01:20:38,965
before I forget
it's just a game.

1375
01:20:38,967 --> 01:20:41,367
All right, now, get out.

1376
01:20:41,369 --> 01:20:43,636
Come on, beat it.

1377
01:20:48,577 --> 01:20:50,210
Oh, it's Moondoggie!

1378
01:20:50,212 --> 01:20:51,010
I could just die.

1379
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:54,214
I suppose you'll tell him
how you dusted me off.

1380
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:55,782
Oh, that'll slay him.

1381
01:20:55,784 --> 01:20:57,050
It'll really slay him.

1382
01:20:57,052 --> 01:21:00,353
The two of you
can fall down laughing.

1383
01:21:22,777 --> 01:21:23,943
Come on, open up!

1384
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,480
Come on, I know she's in there!

1385
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:32,151
Come on, open up!

1386
01:21:33,521 --> 01:21:37,090
Hey, look, pal,
I'm a little busy in here.

1387
01:21:37,092 --> 01:21:38,191
Get lost, huh.

1388
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:39,592
Not a chance.

1389
01:21:39,594 --> 01:21:44,030
This is something I would've
never pegged you for.

1390
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:07,687
Bringing a broad to a place
like this, that's one thing,

1391
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:09,055
but the Gidget...

1392
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:10,290
What's wrong with the Gidge?

1393
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:14,127
Personally, I find her
delightful company, and...

1394
01:22:14,129 --> 01:22:16,029
a very good sport.

1395
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:29,008
Hey, you had enough?

1396
01:22:30,812 --> 01:22:33,513
I'll tell you what
I've had enough of...

1397
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:45,658
That's the place. Right over there.
Right down there.

1398
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:49,028
All right, lady, stand back.
We'll take care of it.

1399
01:22:57,471 --> 01:22:58,471
I told Walter

1400
01:22:58,473 --> 01:23:00,773
the minute we saw
that girl go in...

1401
01:23:00,775 --> 01:23:01,240
trouble.

1402
01:23:01,242 --> 01:23:03,176
I got an eye for
things like this.

1403
01:23:03,178 --> 01:23:05,945
I can spot trouble through
a crack in the blind,

1404
01:23:05,947 --> 01:23:09,215
and when that other one
went banging on the door,

1405
01:23:09,217 --> 01:23:12,018
I told Walter,
"Call the police."

1406
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:15,722
No, just a friendly
little tousle, officer.

1407
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:17,390
There won't be any more trouble.

1408
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:19,959
I can promise you that.

1409
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:22,095
All right, Matthews,

1410
01:23:22,097 --> 01:23:24,330
we'll hold you to it.

1411
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:26,232
Thank you.

1412
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:29,302
All right, where's the Gidget?

1413
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:29,836
She's not here.

1414
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:33,139
You may as well know, she's scarcely
the charmer I made her out to be.

1415
01:23:33,141 --> 01:23:35,641
I guess you heard her
squawking for help, huh?

1416
01:23:35,643 --> 01:23:36,275
Why you...

1417
01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:37,844
The party's over, now blow.

1418
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:39,245
I'll blow when I'm ready.

1419
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:40,580
Get ready.

1420
01:23:40,582 --> 01:23:42,315
Underneath it all,
I always did think

1421
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:43,516
you were a little bit
of a square.

1422
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:45,451
Yeah, well, listen, if
cutting corners like you...

1423
01:23:45,453 --> 01:23:46,453
Bury it.

1424
01:23:46,454 --> 01:23:47,620
Either a man's got a talent

1425
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:50,023
for a certain way of
life, or he hasn't.

1426
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:52,992
You never really did belong.

1427
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:07,940
You just lost a customer.

1428
01:24:10,478 --> 01:24:12,678
Ohh!

1429
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,531
Oh, gee, thanks for stopping.

1430
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:32,231
You see, I got a flat.

1431
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:34,600
Isn't it kind of late
for you, young lady?

1432
01:24:34,602 --> 01:24:37,603
May I see your
driver's license please?

1433
01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:38,805
Oh, my purse...

1434
01:24:38,807 --> 01:24:41,674
well, you see I left home
in such a hurry that...

1435
01:24:41,676 --> 01:24:42,508
Uh-huh.

1436
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:44,077
Where have you been?

1437
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:45,144
Oh, just on the road

1438
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:48,347
at a friend's house,
down the highway.

1439
01:24:48,349 --> 01:24:48,881
Oh?

1440
01:24:48,883 --> 01:24:52,518
Well, honest. I mean, I don't
remember the exact address,

1441
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:53,453
but I can prove it.

1442
01:24:53,455 --> 01:24:55,388
It was the little white house

1443
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:56,456
with a long boardwalk.

1444
01:24:56,458 --> 01:24:58,925
Can't you get on the radio
and notify the prowl cars

1445
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:01,894
to be on the lookout
for my daughter?

1446
01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:03,429
You have radios
in the cars, don't you?

1447
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:05,264
Yes, sir. Sir, if you
just calm down a little,

1448
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:07,033
we might be able to help you.

1449
01:25:07,035 --> 01:25:07,834
I'm sorry, sergeant.

1450
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:09,869
What's the girl's name?

1451
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:10,403
Frances.

1452
01:25:10,405 --> 01:25:12,405
She's about this tall, blond,

1453
01:25:12,407 --> 01:25:13,372
and she was wearing a little...

1454
01:25:13,374 --> 01:25:17,977
Orange dress with some white
strings on the front?

1455
01:25:18,513 --> 01:25:20,379
Francie! Oh, Mama...

1456
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:21,314
Where have you been?

1457
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:22,515
We found her on the road.

1458
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:24,016
She's obviously
been to the shack

1459
01:25:24,018 --> 01:25:26,652
where they'd been drinking
beer, had a fistfight...

1460
01:25:26,654 --> 01:25:27,820
Oh, no!

1461
01:25:27,822 --> 01:25:29,722
If you ever dare
to go out again without...

1462
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:31,991
I'm afraid the place
you daughter was,

1463
01:25:31,993 --> 01:25:33,593
it looked like a real brawl.

1464
01:25:33,595 --> 01:25:34,994
Just a tip, sir.

1465
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:36,596
Kids need some supervision,

1466
01:25:36,598 --> 01:25:37,663
a little parental interest...

1467
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:39,599
Thank you. Thank you, officer.

1468
01:25:39,601 --> 01:25:43,236
I assure you, nothing like
this will ever happen again.

1469
01:25:43,238 --> 01:25:45,705
Frances Lawrence,
now, listen to me.

1470
01:25:45,707 --> 01:25:46,873
If I have to lock you
in your room,

1471
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:49,175
you will never again go
near those beach hoodlums.

1472
01:25:49,177 --> 01:25:52,311
Don't worry. I never again want
to lay eyes on them again.

1473
01:25:55,617 --> 01:25:57,617
Francie!

1474
01:25:58,753 --> 01:26:01,521
Hey, Francie, come here!

1475
01:26:08,129 --> 01:26:10,630
Listen, girl, and
please don't get sore

1476
01:26:10,632 --> 01:26:11,998
because it's been so long,

1477
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,232
because everything's fixed now.

1478
01:26:13,234 --> 01:26:16,502
And we've made some real
conquests down at State beach.

1479
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:18,004
Yes, and there's
this one extra guy

1480
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:20,540
who says he even
prefers tomboys.

1481
01:26:20,542 --> 01:26:24,777
I'm sorry, girls, but I guess
I'm just not interested...

1482
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:29,182
and even if I was, last night,
my dad was on a real rampage,

1483
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:31,717
and he says he's
running my social life

1484
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:33,986
from here on in.

1485
01:26:35,156 --> 01:26:37,156
Thanks anyway.

1486
01:26:39,227 --> 01:26:40,860
Oh, poor Francie.

1487
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:42,495
I don't know how
she's going to face

1488
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:43,796
going back to senior year.

1489
01:26:43,798 --> 01:26:47,366
With nothing to show
for the whole summer!

1490
01:26:56,945 --> 01:27:00,346
Hurry up, Francie,
you'll be late.

1491
01:27:00,582 --> 01:27:02,782
Darling, what is it?

1492
01:27:02,784 --> 01:27:04,350
Aw, Mom, the other girls,

1493
01:27:04,352 --> 01:27:05,985
they don't seem to have
any trouble,

1494
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:08,254
but me, I'm hopeless.

1495
01:27:08,256 --> 01:27:09,722
I can tell you right now,

1496
01:27:09,724 --> 01:27:11,324
I'll probably die an old maid

1497
01:27:11,326 --> 01:27:13,793
and never have made the step.

1498
01:27:13,795 --> 01:27:14,894
The step?

1499
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:16,696
Aw, Mom, I could perish,

1500
01:27:16,698 --> 01:27:17,863
I could perish with shame.

1501
01:27:17,865 --> 01:27:21,801
Last night, after all those
hours of concentrated effort,

1502
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:26,138
I come home as pure
as the driven snow.

1503
01:27:27,175 --> 01:27:30,409
Darling... you're right.

1504
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:33,212
A girl does have
to become a woman,

1505
01:27:33,214 --> 01:27:37,917
but you've got it a
little mixed up, Francie.

1506
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:39,752
Come here.

1507
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:42,588
Grandma's old sampler, remember?

1508
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:43,155
Read it.

1509
01:27:43,157 --> 01:27:46,659
"To be a real woman is to
bring out the best in a man."

1510
01:27:46,661 --> 01:27:50,963
Sweet, but tell it
to the boys today.

1511
01:27:51,165 --> 01:27:53,899
Oh, anyway, it's too late.

1512
01:27:54,068 --> 01:27:56,135
I just don't care anymore.

1513
01:27:56,137 --> 01:27:57,870
Oh, Francie!

1514
01:27:57,872 --> 01:27:58,471
Francie, girl!

1515
01:27:58,473 --> 01:28:01,407
You have a visitor.
Jeffrey Matthews is here!

1516
01:28:01,409 --> 01:28:03,142
Oh, Mom, do I have to go?

1517
01:28:03,144 --> 01:28:05,144
Oh, darling,
your father's so anxious

1518
01:28:05,146 --> 01:28:07,179
for you to find new interests,

1519
01:28:07,181 --> 01:28:10,049
so why don't you go, hmm?

1520
01:28:10,051 --> 01:28:11,317
Come on.

1521
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:14,553
I'll be down in a minute.

1522
01:28:19,427 --> 01:28:21,093
I know
that you and Francie

1523
01:28:21,095 --> 01:28:22,628
will have a lot in common.

1524
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:24,697
She's an accomplished musician.

1525
01:28:24,699 --> 01:28:26,198
She plays the...

1526
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:30,069
Francie,
this is Jeffrey Matthews.

1527
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:31,771
My daughter, Francie.

1528
01:28:31,773 --> 01:28:33,139
Uh, Francie...

1529
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:34,440
this is Jeffrey.

1530
01:28:34,442 --> 01:28:37,076
My daughter, Francie, Jeffrey.

1531
01:28:37,078 --> 01:28:38,744
Hello.

1532
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,414
How do you do?

1533
01:28:41,916 --> 01:28:44,717
Uh, sit down, Jeffrey.

1534
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:48,454
Francie, won't you... sit down?

1535
01:28:50,124 --> 01:28:54,393
Well, the weather
certainly has been...

1536
01:28:54,629 --> 01:28:57,630
Oh, this is my wife,
Mrs. Lawrence.

1537
01:28:57,632 --> 01:28:59,365
This is Jeffrey's son, Jeff.

1538
01:28:59,367 --> 01:29:01,467
Hello, Jeff. Mrs. Lawrence.

1539
01:29:01,469 --> 01:29:02,368
Won't you sit down, dear?

1540
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:05,971
I fixed some iced coffee
for you, if you'd like.

1541
01:29:05,973 --> 01:29:08,574
Uh, Mother, I feel
a headache coming on.

1542
01:29:08,576 --> 01:29:10,309
I think I'll go and lie down.

1543
01:29:10,311 --> 01:29:11,043
Say, I've uh...

1544
01:29:11,045 --> 01:29:13,579
my friend let me have his
convertible tonight, and...

1545
01:29:13,581 --> 01:29:14,647
Well, you know what they say

1546
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:16,515
about fresh air for a headache.

1547
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:17,183
Good idea.

1548
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:18,818
I've got the top down
and everything.

1549
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:23,122
Uh, may, I, uh,
call you Francie?

1550
01:29:23,558 --> 01:29:25,725
Why not... Jeffrey?

1551
01:29:25,727 --> 01:29:27,460
Go right ahead.

1552
01:29:27,462 --> 01:29:30,563
Darling, try to be gracious.

1553
01:29:34,669 --> 01:29:35,901
Bye-bye.

1554
01:29:35,903 --> 01:29:36,702
Bye.

1555
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:38,804
Bye. Have a good time.

1556
01:29:38,806 --> 01:29:40,339
Wow.

1557
01:29:43,611 --> 01:29:46,178
Now, look, what kind
of a gag is this?

1558
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:47,279
Wasn't last night enough?

1559
01:29:47,281 --> 01:29:49,882
Do you have to come back
for more laughs?

1560
01:29:49,884 --> 01:29:52,451
Hey, look, this wasn't my idea.

1561
01:29:52,453 --> 01:29:54,120
I came as a favor to my dad.

1562
01:29:54,122 --> 01:29:58,958
How was I to guess some drip cello
student would turn out to be you?

1563
01:29:58,960 --> 01:29:59,358
Thanks.

1564
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,594
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1565
01:30:01,596 --> 01:30:02,595
Now, figure it this way...

1566
01:30:02,597 --> 01:30:04,130
it's better than trying
to keep up a farce

1567
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:06,332
in front of your parents.

1568
01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:10,936
Anyway, right now, there's
one thing I've got to do,

1569
01:30:10,938 --> 01:30:14,840
and you're coming with me.
Come on, get in.

1570
01:30:23,184 --> 01:30:24,617
What's the idea?

1571
01:30:24,619 --> 01:30:28,554
Just want to take
a last look, is all.

1572
01:30:29,322 --> 01:30:30,322
Gidge...

1573
01:30:30,324 --> 01:30:33,225
There's nothing more to say.

1574
01:30:33,327 --> 01:30:36,295
I'm only here to be gracious.

1575
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:07,860
Kahuna, what are you doing?

1576
01:31:07,862 --> 01:31:08,961
Closing up shop.

1577
01:31:08,963 --> 01:31:09,728
You know, call of the sea,

1578
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:12,198
follow the sun,
and all of that jazz.

1579
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:13,732
But last night, you
never mentioned it.

1580
01:31:13,734 --> 01:31:16,135
You didn't even
say goodbye or...

1581
01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:19,004
Well, isn't it usual
for friends to...

1582
01:31:19,006 --> 01:31:20,105
He wouldn't dig the word.

1583
01:31:20,107 --> 01:31:22,475
What's with you two?
What's happened?

1584
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:23,976
Nothing, except
the guy he pictured

1585
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:25,177
to be above the whole crowd,

1586
01:31:25,179 --> 01:31:27,780
he now figures for the gutter.

1587
01:31:28,982 --> 01:31:29,982
Kahuna, listen...

1588
01:31:29,984 --> 01:31:32,284
Get off my back, will you?

1589
01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:41,627
Look, last night,

1590
01:31:41,629 --> 01:31:43,562
I guess we both said a lot
of things we didn't mean.

1591
01:31:43,564 --> 01:31:44,897
- Who didn't mean them?
- Jeff...

1592
01:31:44,899 --> 01:31:45,631
Like I said,

1593
01:31:45,633 --> 01:31:49,535
either a guy's got a talent for a
certain way of life, or he hasn't.

1594
01:31:50,538 --> 01:31:51,804
He's taken a job.

1595
01:31:51,806 --> 01:31:55,207
All that bilge
about the free soul,

1596
01:31:55,209 --> 01:31:55,841
it's fake.

1597
01:31:55,843 --> 01:31:59,578
It doesn't mean anything if a
guy doesn't really mean it.

1598
01:32:01,415 --> 01:32:02,414
It's a fake and a phony

1599
01:32:02,416 --> 01:32:06,085
if it's not
what you really want...

1600
01:32:07,788 --> 01:32:09,121
and you don't.

1601
01:32:09,123 --> 01:32:11,290
But you do. That's right, I do.

1602
01:32:11,292 --> 01:32:12,858
You don't need anybody.

1603
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:13,626
Not a soul.

1604
01:32:13,628 --> 01:32:15,327
No, just a free life, no chains.

1605
01:32:15,329 --> 01:32:18,297
Not a one, not a one and a...

1606
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:24,203
Okay...

1607
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:26,639
so you know.

1608
01:32:26,707 --> 01:32:29,208
I can't kid anybody.

1609
01:32:30,311 --> 01:32:34,713
You start a guy like me
thinking, it's fatal.

1610
01:32:35,249 --> 01:32:37,516
So long, Gidget.

1611
01:32:50,131 --> 01:32:51,897
And you...

1612
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:56,302
Just remember, she
might be pint-sized,

1613
01:32:56,304 --> 01:32:59,104
but she's quite a woman.

1614
01:33:15,889 --> 01:33:16,889
Hey...

1615
01:33:16,891 --> 01:33:17,891
What did he, uh...

1616
01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:20,259
what did he mean,
"Quite a woman"?

1617
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:23,929
Oh, it's just something
between the two of us...

1618
01:33:23,931 --> 01:33:26,966
and my mom and my grandmother.

1619
01:33:28,468 --> 01:33:29,468
Gee, I...

1620
01:33:29,470 --> 01:33:32,304
I never figured he'd change.

1621
01:33:32,306 --> 01:33:34,673
Well, he's not the
only one who's changed.

1622
01:33:35,409 --> 01:33:37,176
I wired my dad
this morning, and...

1623
01:33:37,178 --> 01:33:43,048
and I'm headed back home for
college tomorrow, and, uh...

1624
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:46,819
Well, I just hope
we could part friends.

1625
01:33:46,821 --> 01:33:51,056
After all, we did have
a lot of laughs this summer.

1626
01:33:51,058 --> 01:33:53,759
Yeah, I guess we did.

1627
01:33:54,128 --> 01:33:55,427
Hey, what is this?

1628
01:33:55,429 --> 01:33:56,328
I've never had any trouble

1629
01:33:56,330 --> 01:33:58,697
talking with girls
before in my life,

1630
01:33:58,699 --> 01:34:01,099
but with you, it's different.

1631
01:34:01,135 --> 01:34:07,606
Look, you're the one that's been
telling me all about this, uh...

1632
01:34:07,608 --> 01:34:12,478
crazy feeling one person can
get about another person.

1633
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:14,313
Yes?

1634
01:34:15,249 --> 01:34:17,716
Oh, what's the use.

1635
01:34:17,718 --> 01:34:19,218
Moondoggie...

1636
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:20,753
Forget it.

1637
01:34:20,755 --> 01:34:22,488
Moondoggie...

1638
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:23,455
Come on, Francie,
I'll take you home.

1639
01:34:23,457 --> 01:34:28,727
Oh, brother, the bigger the
are, the dopier they come.

1640
01:34:38,472 --> 01:34:40,506
Oh, gee, would, uh...

1641
01:34:40,508 --> 01:34:44,543
would you, uh, sort of wear
this till I come back?

1642
01:34:44,545 --> 01:34:47,012
Oh, boy, would I!

1643
01:34:49,015 --> 01:34:50,015
Oh, just wait...

1644
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:51,483
wait till the girls
get a load of this.

1645
01:34:51,485 --> 01:34:54,887
Honest to goodness,
it's the absolute ultimate!
