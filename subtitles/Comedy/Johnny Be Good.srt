1
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:39,613
Dear Lord...

2
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:42,409
we pray that we may
win this game today.

3
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:46,142
We ask that you give us
the strength and the courage...

4
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:50,081
to win our second straight
state championship.

5
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,171
We ask, Lord, that...

6
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,737
nobody on our side
is seriously injured.

7
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:00,705
We know in our hearts, Lord...

8
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:02,735
that we are the best team.

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,381
We ask that you allow us
to win this game.

10
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:16,377
The Lord wants you to put
your foot on their balls...

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,073
and believe in it...

12
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,411
because that's
what wins football games.

13
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:25,279
Not jumping offsides like
a bunch of wimps and faggots.

14
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:29,804
All right, lift your heads.
Prayer's over. I talked to God.

15
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:34,213
I'm through talking to God.
Now I'm talking to you.

16
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:36,577
You're going to be out there
in front of your families...

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,170
your student body.

18
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,271
Every girl you ever had
a hard-on for...

19
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,473
is gonna be out there today,
but you will not be going...

20
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,036
to no sock hop tonight, boys.

21
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:46,843
You will not get no honey
on your stinger tonight...

22
00:01:46,867 --> 00:01:50,474
if you don't go out there
and bust your ass.

23
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,538
Because this is it.

24
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:55,376
This is the big one.

25
00:01:57,967 --> 00:01:59,605
I want you to taste it.

26
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:02,773
I want you to smell it, son.

27
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:08,410
There's winners...

28
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:10,435
and there's nothing else.

29
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:13,380
I don't give a shit what
those pinkos over in Russia say.

30
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,540
You want to be a loser,
you go live in Russia.

31
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:20,344
I'm not a loser. I'm a winner.

32
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:21,778
I'm an American.

33
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,473
Who wants to be John Wayne?

34
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,107
Who wants to go out there
and grab a root and hang on?

35
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:28,942
Who wants to get a mean-on?

36
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:30,878
Get a mean-on, son.

37
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,938
Let me see
you get a mean-on, son!

38
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:36,811
Now, who wants it?
I want to know! Who wants this?

39
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:37,971
Who wants to get
a mean-on right now?

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,104


41
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:41,511
-Who wants it?
-I want it!

42
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:14,376
Good job, man!

43
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,110
The pride of Ashcroft High,
Johnny Walker!

44
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:20,476
Hut!

45
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,937
By God,
we're playing football now!

46
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:29,945
Yes, sir!

47
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:32,174
Coach? It's the last game
of the season.

48
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,737
Do you think I could maybe
get in for a couple of minutes?

49
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:38,112
-You want to play?
-Yes. Please.

50
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:39,476
No, you don't.

51
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,346
Hut! Hut!

52
00:03:58,233 --> 00:04:01,373
Walker's fortieth T.D. pass
this season!

53
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,937
A new state record!

54
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:07,210
Wide! Wide set!

55
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:19,207
Gash, give him
the punt sign, will ya?

56
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:27,445
Walker! Kick the ball! Kick it!

57
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,468
Hut!

58
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,811
Another record for Walker!

59
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,369
-Did you see that?
-Look at that!

60
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,710
Five-second hang time?

61
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:55,068
Pardon you.

62
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,213
With that completion
to Michael Bentley...

63
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:04,476
Walker has just set
a national high school record!

64
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,778
1:35, Gibson's out of his car
and into the stadium.

65
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:14,937
Excuse me. Shove over,
would you, please? Thanks.

66
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:17,607
Coach...

67
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:19,704
that offer still stands.

68
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:21,610
My answer's still no.

69
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:23,613
You wait for us
for the signals!

70
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:25,544
We're calling
the plays here, Walker!

71
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:28,776
I think the score is 52-0.

72
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,780
What can we do
to get Gash in the game?

73
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,178
I got it.
Let's lose five. Break!

74
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,474
Break!

75
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:38,174
Push it in!
I want another score!

76
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,305
Let's go! Let's go!

77
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:45,347
Hut! Hut!

78
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:47,608
I'm going down.
Oh, it's the leg. I'm down.

79
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:50,943
What's he doing?
What's Walker doing?

80
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:53,607
I think I broke my dick!

81
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,141
Oh, no, not his George.

82
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:59,647
Walker's out.
Gash! Gash! Get me Gash!

83
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:00,737
Right here. What's up?

84
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:02,804
Get in the game, Gash!
Put it in the end zone.

85
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:03,971
My first time!

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,139
-What's the matter, son?
-I broke my dick, Coach.

87
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,078
Rub some dirt on it
and get back in there.

88
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,511
It's broken, I'm telling you.

89
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:11,479
You go left.

90
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,036
You go right. I'll run.

91
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:14,068
Break!

92
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,801
Hut!

93
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:25,346
Oh, Gash! Gash!

94
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:27,779
Throw your navel
in the ground, will ya?

95
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,144
-Hey, Juicy.
-Hey, Johnny.

96
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:31,942
Would you mind taking off
your underpants real quick...

97
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:33,241
and go stand over there?

98
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,611
-Sure. Anything for you.
-Thank you.

99
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:41,906
2:35, cheerleader taking
her yellow panties off.

100
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:43,503
Thank you. Over and out.

101
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,770
Hey, guys, Juicy Dorfman
isn't wearing any underpants.

102
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,480
SQ?

103
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,481
Left, 46, on the first sound.

104
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,478
Ready?

105
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,478
Break!

106
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,501
Break!

107
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,941
Oh, I see.

108
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:10,640
That girl's not wearing
any underwear.

109
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:11,839
What?

110
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:13,847
-Which one?
-Hey, check it out!

111
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,471
Hut!

112
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,907
<i>Hob; mob!‘-!</i>

113
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:24,276
Oh, wrong.

114
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,108
I see the hole!
I see the hole!

115
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:35,010
I see--yeah!

116
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,703
Ashcroft High has just won...

117
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:51,203
their second consecutive
state football championship!

118
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:54,043
Congratulations
to coach Wayne Hisler...

119
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:57,640
and especially to everyone's
high school all-American...

120
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:59,669
Johnny Walker!

121
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:24,241
Hello?

122
00:08:24,267 --> 00:08:26,907
Hey, Johnny.
Glad I could get to you.

123
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:28,276
<i>This is Howard Case“.</i>

124
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,042
You were just tremendous
out there today.

125
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:33,809
I've never seen
a better performance...

126
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,073
at the high school level.

127
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,604
You should go
to an Ivy League school...

128
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:42,740
by the name of Yale University,
in my opinion, young man.

129
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:45,008
Have you thought
about such a thing?

130
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:47,013
ls this really you, Howard?
Howard?

131
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:50,139
-Who is this?
-This is Howard Cosell.

132
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:53,148
Does anybody in America
like you? Huh?

133
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,572
Coach, I'm sorry.

134
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,705
My boys, my boys, all right.

135
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:03,371
That's worth a victory, huh?

136
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,880
That's worth a victory.

137
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:10,774
Johnny, listen to me, man.

138
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,905
Sign with me,
I will make you a star.

139
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:14,276
Ignore all these
other guys, man.

140
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,109
They're a bunch
of athletic pimps.

141
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:18,340
Trust me--athletic pimps.
Look at the way they dress.

142
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:20,278
Write your own ticket!
I'll give you anything you want.

143
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,371
Spring break, huh? Puerto Rico!

144
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,744
Just tell me what you want,
and I'll get you two of them.

145
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:26,303
What do you like?
You like girls?

146
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,473
-I like your head.
-You got it! What else?

147
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,207
Ice cream? Cultural pursuits?

148
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:35,306
Johnny, I can offer you
TV coverage.

149
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,939
I can offer you TV
every single Saturday.

150
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:39,947
You don't need him.

151
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:42,140
I got what you want.
I got what you need.

152
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:44,875
We'll keep running
that style of offense, boy.

153
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,902
You're gonna start right away!
Right away, you hear?

154
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:48,879
That's what you want to do--
play football, right, boy?

155
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:01,780
Smurfs. Smurfs. Smurf patrol.

156
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,303
Hi. Thank you.

157
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,040
Watch my feet. Watch the toes.

158
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:07,637
OK. Don't I know your mom?

159
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,476
What's it like being king
of the 12-year-olds?

160
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,502
Georgia! What?

161
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:12,910
Say that again?

162
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:15,573
What's it like being king
of the 12-year-olds?

163
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,977
Let me tell you something.
These girls are gonna be...

164
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,775
beautiful grown women
in about two minutes.

165
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,178
-You shouldn't really say that.
-Freeze!

166
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,373
Move away from my daughter,
Walker!

167
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,879
Don't tell me
he's still pissed off...

168
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,777
'cause I brought you home
a day late?

169
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,871
Don't tell me that.
ls that what happened?

170
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,346
No.

171
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:32,345
Johnny..

172
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:33,846
What? What was it?

173
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,505
It was the hickeys.

174
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:37,479
You can't really
cover those up at all.

175
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:41,877
-What?
-Let's give him one.

176
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,580
Get your mouth off her, Walker!

177
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,341
Let's go, Georgia!

178
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:51,368
"Ow!

179
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:57,644
I'll see you later.

180
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:58,645
Very good.

181
00:10:58,667 --> 00:10:59,941
Do you love me?

182
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,280
Thank you.

183
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,109
I can't say anything
but thank you.

184
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,412
-Over here, boy!
-Johnny!

185
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:12,435
You could be going
to the Super Bowl!

186
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,271
Excuse me. Excuse me.

187
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,713
I'm sorry. I can't talk now.
I have to go. Watch the jacket.

188
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:23,110
We'll talk later. OK.

189
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:24,669
Wrong!

190
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,476
Less with the lies,
more with the broads!

191
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,501
Back off!

192
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:32,978
Bye now!

193
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,446
Thank you.
Thanks a lot, recruiters!

194
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:37,378
You think those recruiters
would all want you as much...

195
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,779
if they knew you were
afraid of the dark?

196
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,177
I'm not afraid of the dark.

197
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,043
It's OK. I'm not gonna
spill the beans...

198
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:45,671
that you sleep
with a night-light.

199
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,543
I don't need a night-light.

200
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:52,481
Come on. Yes, you do. It's OK.
You're a punk. Accept it.

201
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,741
All right, I accept it.

202
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:56,713
So what?!

203
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:57,973
SQ?

204
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,004
OK, hit me again.

205
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,335
Right here.

206
00:12:08,233 --> 00:12:10,110
I feel good now.

207
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:13,376
Leo, it's time you and me
moved on to big-time, pal.

208
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,243
-The big-time scholarships...
-UCC.

209
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:19,079
-Big-time contacts, big deals.
-UCC is the place for you.

210
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,080
Hey, did I ever tell you
about Coach Hisler's wife?

211
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,047
-No. UCC.
-She has a set of chihuahuas...

212
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:27,214
There's someone sneakin‘

213
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:30,237
Round the corner

214
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:32,713
Could that someone

215
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:35,976
Be Mack the Knife?

216
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,742
There's a tugboat

217
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:41,407
Down by the river,
don't you know?

218
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:44,710
Well, the cement there

219
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:47,543
Just a-drooping on down

220
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,240
You're getting
really good, Wayne.

221
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:51,440
I just love your singing.

222
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:52,639
Thank you, baby.

223
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:55,204
You know, I was reading
at the market today...

224
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,679
that we all come
from another world...

225
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,273
and we choose in that world who
we want to be in this world...

226
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,771
and we're all connected
by a common cosmic thread.

227
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,336
That's right, honey.
That's true.

228
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:08,710
What time you going to work?

229
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:11,339
After I make dinner for you
and clean up.

230
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:15,782
Do you realize that we're living
nine lives simultaneously?

231
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,972
Of course.

232
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,608
-Listen, sweetcake?
-Yes?

233
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,635
On your way back from work,
would you pick up...

234
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,112
my yellow suit
from the cleaners?

235
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:27,273
OK. No problem.
It's near that bakery...

236
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,749
that bakes that black
mundle bread you love so much.

237
00:13:43,367 --> 00:13:44,641
Hello. Coach Hisler's house?

238
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:46,146
ls he in?

239
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:47,908
I think so.

240
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:49,003
May l?

241
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:52,537
Oh, sure. Just follow
the sound of the music.

242
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:53,841
Thank you.

243
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:55,175
Whoo, look out

244
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,611
Oh, Miss Lottie Lenya

245
00:13:56,633 --> 00:14:01,173
And old Lucy Brown

246
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,444
Chancellor, how are you?
Good to see you again, sir.

247
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:07,276
How about that game today, huh?

248
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,211
Nice. Walker was everything
you said he was.

249
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:10,234
Yes.

250
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,508
What do I do to get him
to go to Piermont?

251
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:14,706
I just want you to sit down
and relax. Enjoy my home.

252
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:16,940
You're going to have dinner
with us, aren't you?

253
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:21,507
I don't think we have enough
salmon patties, Wayne.

254
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:23,342
What the hey?

255
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:26,246
Break out
the fish sticks, honey.

256
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:27,371
<i>Oh, OK.</i>

257
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,143
Darling. Some of that
sparkling fruit wine.

258
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:35,277
Have a seat, please,
Chancellor.

259
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,507
Look, Coach, I didn't get
to become president...

260
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:40,446
of Piermont University
by mincing words.

261
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:42,572
My backers
are getting impatient.

262
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,477
They want success this year.

263
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,538
They want to win.
I want Walker.

264
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:50,207
I'm the key to Walker,
obviously.

265
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:51,837
Obviously you are.

266
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:55,280
What is it you want?
Name your price.

267
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,747
I want to be the new head coach
at Piermont University.

268
00:14:58,767 --> 00:14:59,768
ls that all?

269
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,802
No. I want a five-year
no-cut contract...

270
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,210
weekly television show...

271
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:05,941
membership in the country club,
et cetera. All the usual perks.

272
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:09,380
The main thing is that Walker
is going to go...

273
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,540
where I tell him to go,
or he's not going anywhere.

274
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:13,841
That's a fact.

275
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:16,609
You can guarantee that?

276
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:18,476
The kid loves me.

277
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,741
You know, it's--.

278
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:23,043
I'm like a father to him.
Really.

279
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:25,707
Hisler's such an asshole.

280
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,049
Johnny, I've been having all
these twisted visions lately.

281
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:33,944
So lay one on me.

282
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:37,073
Well, I was thinking
about developing...

283
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,808
a deep personal relationship
with a psychiatrist.

284
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,540
You know, very tight.

285
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,569
And then one day, just while
he's complimenting me...

286
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,637
on all the headway
progress I'm making...

287
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:48,443
in the area of my obsessive
fear of torque wrenches...

288
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:52,540
just cut him off mid-sentence
and say, "Hey, oops!

289
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:56,105
"Why am I angry at you today?"
He gets all Germanic on me...

290
00:15:56,133 --> 00:15:58,670
and goes, "Well,
I think that it stems--"

291
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,408
It stems from nothing.
That's a trick question.

292
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:04,277
I take his Ph.D. off the wall
and beat him...

293
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,541
about the head and shoulders
with it for about an hour...

294
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:08,979
and then I whisper
softly in his ear...

295
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,379
"I'd like to pay for my next
twenty visits in advance."

296
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:31,807
Johnny, be all you can be.

297
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:35,144
-For $81.50 a month after taxes?
-Exactly.

298
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:36,908
No, I don't think so.
Thank you, though.

299
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:39,106
-Notre Dame, my son.
-Father, how you doing?

300
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:40,874
Aren't you gonna be late
for a mass or something?

301
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,277
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry.

302
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,644
Alabama is football.
Alabama's where you should be!

303
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:46,669
Penn State is always
in the top ten.

304
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,407
We kicked Alabama's butt
last year.

305
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:50,845
That was one game.
It's freezing in Penn State.

306
00:16:50,867 --> 00:16:52,005
It's a normal climate.

307
00:16:52,033 --> 00:16:54,274
Normal? Normal if you're
a seal or an eskimo.

308
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,007
It's good to see
the seasons change!

309
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:58,138
It's good to see
the seasons change!

310
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:03,512
Leo, Leo.

311
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:06,480
My school has a buddy system.
If Johnny goes there...

312
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,741
all of his buddies get
to go there, too, first class.

313
00:17:08,767 --> 00:17:10,769
Boy buddies, girl buddies,
everybody.

314
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,404
I'm ready for college...

315
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:13,776
and corruption.

316
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,245
My school doesn't do that, Leo.

317
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,406
It just exists
in your imagination.

318
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:19,344
Well, I have
a grand imagination.

319
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,812
How about ten grand?

320
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:31,175
Leo, more chicken?

321
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,441
I'll just get the rest
to go, please.

322
00:17:33,467 --> 00:17:34,537
Right.

323
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:36,979
Anything, Johnny, anything!

324
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,377
I love you!

325
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,107
Let's set a time!

326
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:42,773
I'm free tonight!

327
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,676
I can't believe the bald guy
is still here.

328
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,145
It's crazy out there.

329
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:52,910
Well, it's crazy in here, too,
but I like it.

330
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:55,539
My lures are selling
like hotcakes.

331
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:58,070
They especially like
my walleyed gibbler.

332
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,842
- This is exciting.
-It's original, huh?

333
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:03,104
Oh, honey, I'm proud of you.
I really am.

334
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:05,079
You've worked hard for this
for a long time.

335
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,272
Thank you, Mom.

336
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,473
You know I couldn't have
done it without you.

337
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,535
Yeah.

338
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:11,604
I'm glad you know it,
'cause it's true.

339
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,909
I swear one day very soon
I'm gonna work hard enough...

340
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:15,844
that you're not gonna
have to work again, Mom.

341
00:18:15,867 --> 00:18:17,869
I don't mind working, Johnny.

342
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,313
It's a decent way
to make a living.

343
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,109
Well, I know you don't mind.
That's why I do.

344
00:18:24,133 --> 00:18:26,170
Where's Georgia today?

345
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,975
Yeah. Where is she?

346
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,843
She's grounded.

347
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:32,848
-Why?
-For knowing me.

348
00:18:32,867 --> 00:18:35,108
Yes. I can understand that.

349
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:38,512
Popping off, Ma, huh?

350
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:39,978
You ready for a little
pea in the head, Ma?

351
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,276
Will you stop?
No, wait. Now, don't.

352
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,473
You want another one?
Here it is. Whoa.

353
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,843
All right. You stop.

354
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,838
All right, that's it.
No dessert. What can I do?

355
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:54,177
So, Ray, what did you think
of the game?

356
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,306
You looked goofy.

357
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,471
I looked what?

358
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,706
Goofy.

359
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:02,009
You didn't look in the mirror
today. You know why?

360
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:04,013
'Cause you don't have any teeth.
When you get some front teeth...

361
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:05,512
then you can tell me
how goofy I look.

362
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:09,345
Until that moment comes along,
you can't say anything, OK?

363
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:11,745
-OK? Do you hear me?
-Yes!

364
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:13,542
-Say, "| hear you, Johnny."
-I hear you, Johnny!

365
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:16,309
-Say, "| hear you, big brother."
-I hear you, big brother!

366
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:20,110
-Say, "You are my man."
-You are my man.

367
00:19:20,133 --> 00:19:21,874
No. She just ate. Now...

368
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,174
But much more importantly...

369
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,838
what about Leo's
first touchdown ever?

370
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:26,107
You looked good today.

371
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:28,670
Thank you. Once I got the right
direction going, right?

372
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,375
Why don't you ever eat
at your house, Leo?

373
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,674
Why?

374
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,147
Well, I think it's basically
because my parents hate me...

375
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:39,408
and they have accused me
of carrying...

376
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:42,414
an ammonia-filled tentacle
around with me...

377
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:44,504
which, of course, I do not!

378
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:47,275
What is this, the funny farm?

379
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:51,480
I can understand
why they hate you.

380
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:54,346
Johnny, my boy, you know.

381
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:57,280
Listen. You've got to get
organized, you know?

382
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,280
Now, you've had calls
from Michigan...

383
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,543
UCC, Piermont and OI' Tex...

384
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:06,208
LSU and Kansas and Cornell.

385
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:09,009
What do you think, Mom?
Do I call these people back?

386
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:13,709
Well, superstar, you can start
by clearing the table...

387
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:15,804
and helping me with the dishes.

388
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,502
Nice little reality break
from Mom there, huh?

389
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:20,513
- Isn't that nice?
- Well, you're home now, son.

390
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:21,511
Thank you, Gramp.

391
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:24,480
This doesn't have a hook on it.

392
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,604
And you are in trouble.

393
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:27,271
You couldn't catch
a single monkfish...

394
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,335
if you had to.

395
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:31,177
-See you later.
-That a boy.

396
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,645
A fish.

397
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:40,237
Your family's really nice.

398
00:21:40,267 --> 00:21:42,543
Your <i>mom's</i> a terrible cook.

399
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:45,339
Thank you.

400
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:47,438
-Where are we going now?
-Georgia's.

401
00:21:47,467 --> 00:21:49,777
Really? I thought
she was grounded.

402
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,370
I'm ungrounding her.

403
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:03,173
Freeze, boy!

404
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,906
I see.
It's gotta be a Rottweiler.

405
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:13,346
There's no mistaking this.
That's no chihuahua.

406
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:19,176
I thought her parents hated you.
It must be embarrassing.

407
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,679
Yeah, well, she digs me.

408
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,805
Her father is the one
who I have problems with.

409
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,141
She'll come around.

410
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:28,674
Mrs. Elkans, good evening.

411
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,646
ls Georgia home?

412
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:35,514
Yes...and that's where
she's going to stay.

413
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,876
I just felt the love beam.

414
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,402
She loves me.

415
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,646
Freeze, dirtbags!

416
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:55,046
I don't want you sniffing
around my daughter, Walker.

417
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:56,171
What's shaking, Chief?

418
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,612
Chief, how the hell was patrol?

419
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:00,613
You're in big trouble, Walker.

420
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:03,375
Chief, you can't keep me
away from your daughter.

421
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,971
I'm gonna keep you away
from her forever.

422
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,445
How you gonna do that, Chief?

423
00:23:07,467 --> 00:23:10,073
We're gonna settle this thing
once and for all.

424
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,546
I can't just beat the shit
out of you...

425
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:14,638
so we're gonna have us
a little game of football...

426
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:16,112
and I'm gonna hurt you.

427
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:18,841
I'm gonna play
with these two men right here.

428
00:23:18,867 --> 00:23:20,141
These men right here?

429
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:22,943
OK, hold on. Let me get
a head count for a second.

430
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:24,776
You got one, two,
three, four.

431
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,508
That's a little unfair,
isn't it?

432
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,638
Well, then you can play
with the big cheese.

433
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:31,806
Oh, now I like it.
Chief, one last thing.

434
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:35,303
Once we kick your butt,
Georgia's mine.

435
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:37,244
Well, then,
just to make it fair...

436
00:23:37,267 --> 00:23:40,805
you're gonna get to play
with one hand behind your back.

437
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:42,335
Isn't that cute?

438
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:44,745
Chief, you don't play
with one hand, do you?

439
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:50,179
Let's bless the ball.

440
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,306
A little pooper
for the Troopers.

441
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:07,047
Rotten little piss-ants.

442
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,508
Go, John!

443
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,943
Cheerleaders? Cheerleaders?

444
00:24:15,967 --> 00:24:17,105
Run!

445
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,708
I got it, I got it.

446
00:24:19,733 --> 00:24:21,110
Luther!

447
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:50,937
Can I see some I.D., please?

448
00:24:56,134 --> 00:24:58,375
Nice catch, Cooper.

449
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,975
Yay, Troopers!

450
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,310
Get 'em out of here.

451
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:08,210
Oh, my God.

452
00:25:08,233 --> 00:25:09,234
Hut!

453
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,139
Hey, fat man, get out of here.

454
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:15,703
I'm out of here.

455
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:25,409
Look at him go.
Look at the chief.

456
00:25:25,433 --> 00:25:26,810
Wait a second.

457
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,506
That's a $20 ball.
That's a game ball.

458
00:25:28,533 --> 00:25:30,535
Let's get him.

459
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,046
It started last weekend

460
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:45,775
At the Yale-Harvard game

461
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,373
10:38. This movie is shit.

462
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,439
Girl, I saw your beaver flash

463
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:58,314
I'll never be the same

464
00:25:58,334 --> 00:26:01,872
Oh, no

465
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:10,112
You gave me a soul kiss

466
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:14,411
Oh, it sure was grand

467
00:26:14,434 --> 00:26:17,779
Johnny,
now that I'm homeless...

468
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,609
what do you plan to do with me?

469
00:26:19,633 --> 00:26:21,203
I'm gonna love you.

470
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,880
And I'm gonna marry you.

471
00:26:26,933 --> 00:26:31,279
And that should take care
of about sixty years.

472
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,803
ls that a threat or a promise?

473
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:36,939
That's a threat.

474
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:39,072
I'm getting old, though.

475
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,443
Yeah, real old.

476
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:41,775
I'm serious.

477
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,713
Next thing you know,
I'll be on the beach...

478
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:49,649
with that big belly,
sporting the bikini underwear...

479
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:50,907
just walking.

480
00:26:52,934 --> 00:26:54,811
Then comes gray hair.

481
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:58,440
Then comes ear hair,
coming out of my ears.

482
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:01,277
Then comes white hair.
Then comes no hair.

483
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,041
Then comes no teeth.

484
00:27:03,067 --> 00:27:06,276
Then, boom,
you're 70 years old.

485
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,904
Or 80.

486
00:27:07,933 --> 00:27:10,504
Ooh, nature.

487
00:27:10,534 --> 00:27:12,514
I'll be there.

488
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:27,642
You kids having a good time?

489
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,006
Hi, John. Johnny Ballgame.

490
00:27:33,033 --> 00:27:35,570
All right. Now, I don't mean
to interrupt you.

491
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,341
I just want you
to know, John...

492
00:27:37,367 --> 00:27:40,746
that there's a lot of phony hype
with all these schools.

493
00:27:40,767 --> 00:27:42,940
Now, I know you better
than you know yourself...

494
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:46,540
and right now the best situation
for you is Piermont.

495
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:48,877
Oh, yeah, Coach?

496
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,208
-Really.
-Yeah?

497
00:27:50,234 --> 00:27:53,181
Can I tell them you'll come down
for a visit this weekend?

498
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,201
Coach.

499
00:27:56,634 --> 00:28:00,480
You'd be my horse
if you never even ran a race.

500
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,480
OK, I'll be there.

501
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,673
-Johnny Ballgame.
-OK.

502
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,112
I'll have 'em send you
a plane ticket.

503
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:10,205
You know I've always been
fond of you, kid.

504
00:28:10,233 --> 00:28:11,507
Thank you, Coach.

505
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:14,309
I'm fond of your Pacer.

506
00:28:14,334 --> 00:28:15,369
Thank you.

507
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,936
I'm most fond of it.

508
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:19,345
Hey, you could have
one of these someday.

509
00:28:19,367 --> 00:28:20,869
Don't tease me, Coach.

510
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,846
That's the last damn school
I'd ever visit in my life.

511
00:28:28,867 --> 00:28:31,370
Johnny, why are you visiting
all these schools?

512
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,505
I thought we planned
to go to State...

513
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:37,672
to be together.

514
00:28:39,533 --> 00:28:41,604
I can't just ignore
the opportunity...

515
00:28:41,634 --> 00:28:45,172
to go see schools,
to see the country.

516
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,407
You wouldn't want that.

517
00:28:49,634 --> 00:28:52,410
Come on. When you get
that look on your face--

518
00:28:52,433 --> 00:28:53,571
Let me get a kiss, please.

519
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,773
Like, let me get
a Georgia fish kiss.

520
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,246
Come get it.

521
00:29:01,133 --> 00:29:02,510
Come get it?

522
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:05,411
l will.

523
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,470
It's the way to travel,
ain't it, soldier?

524
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,480
Huh? You see
the country here and...

525
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,310
first-class bucket seats.

526
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:37,335
The price is right, too, huh?

527
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,971
What are you, a private?

528
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,038
Hey, I'm trying to eat.
You mind?

529
00:29:46,067 --> 00:29:48,013
Hey, this is a family bus here.

530
00:29:48,033 --> 00:29:51,242
Hey, Slim.
Hey, I'm trying to eat.

531
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:54,840
Hey, Slim.
Knock it off, will you?

532
00:30:06,067 --> 00:30:08,570
I wonder if that's
the OI' Tex plane.

533
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,307
Have you seen a lot
of commercial airlines...

534
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:12,108
that look like
a flying horny toad?

535
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:13,168
No.

536
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:26,377
Get off that. No. Please.

537
00:30:30,167 --> 00:30:33,011
-Hi. How y'all doing?
-How you doing? Good to see you.

538
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:35,980
My name's Tex Wade. I'm gonna be
your host for the weekend.

539
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,537
I'm gonna make sure
you get everything you want...

540
00:30:38,567 --> 00:30:40,308
from your visit to OI' Tex.

541
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:43,678
Well, thank you, Tex.
You got a lot of style, Tex.

542
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,341
How about a little something
to blur your vision, Johnny?

543
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:50,007
- No, thanks, Tex.
- Well, then hop in.

544
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:52,172
OK. Bye, Georgia.

545
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,271
Johnny, be good.

546
00:30:57,667 --> 00:31:00,045
Come on in, Tex.

547
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:02,138
Georgia, can you see his boots?

548
00:31:03,834 --> 00:31:05,142
See you, Georgia.

549
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:09,578
Just kidding, Tex.

550
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,443
Aw, man!

551
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,780
Where is that punk?

552
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,302
Excuse me?

553
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:29,609
I'm not talking to you, lady.

554
00:31:29,634 --> 00:31:30,977
What a jerk.

555
00:31:36,733 --> 00:31:40,203
Thinks his time is more valuable
than mine, I guess.

556
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:43,407
Probably stroking
his muskrat somewhere.

557
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:49,203
Sit down, Coach.

558
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:50,974
Oh, thank you.

559
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,878
You're late. Where's the kid?

560
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,507
They sprung a math test on him.

561
00:31:58,534 --> 00:31:59,774
You believe that?

562
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,609
He'll be flying down
a little later.

563
00:32:01,634 --> 00:32:03,841
Actually, I should
give him a little call.

564
00:32:03,867 --> 00:32:05,369
Use the phone
back there, please.

565
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,845
Yeah.

566
00:32:06,867 --> 00:32:08,813
You should have seen
that airport.

567
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:09,971
What a madhouse.

568
00:32:11,034 --> 00:32:13,605
It's a beautiful office,
Chancellor.

569
00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:15,806
Not too shabby.

570
00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:19,013
John, how are you?

571
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,206
What's the matter?

572
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:23,008
Well, that's terrible.

573
00:32:23,033 --> 00:32:25,172
Listen.
Don't worry about a thing.

574
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,441
We'll just reschedule
the meeting, OK?

575
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:30,243
I know you want
to come here with me.

576
00:32:30,267 --> 00:32:31,769
You haven't hurt your chances.

577
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,838
Now, look. As soon as I get
off the airplane...

578
00:32:34,867 --> 00:32:36,642
I'm coming right over
to see you.

579
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:39,147
I love you, too, son.

580
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:40,202
Bye-bye.

581
00:32:41,534 --> 00:32:43,013
That's a great kid.

582
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:15,604
I want you to feel
right at home, like family.

583
00:33:15,633 --> 00:33:18,307
Like this was
your very own ranch.

584
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:20,780
Look, this comes straight
from the heart, John.

585
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,041
Everybody here loves you.

586
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,047
You see these long-stemmed
American beauties here?

587
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:26,671
They're all for you.
They're yours.

588
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,306
That grass is yours.
This whole shindig is yours.

589
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:32,246
Them trees are yours.
Hell, that lake is yours.

590
00:33:32,267 --> 00:33:33,769
ls this part
of the campus, Tex?

591
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,973
You could call it
part of the campus, Johnny.

592
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,470
You come to OI' Tex, you can
call it anything you want.

593
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,706
I love OI' Tex.

594
00:33:40,734 --> 00:33:43,510
Margarita, Mr. Wade?
-Don't mind if we do, darling.

595
00:33:43,533 --> 00:33:44,637
Here you go.

596
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:46,544
Never had one of these.

597
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:50,447
Shit. Everybody drinks
margaritas at OI' Tex.

598
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:52,344
Feisty little filly, ain't she?

599
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:54,711
My wife says they're medicinal.

600
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:55,973
The ride has started!

601
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,411
He's out of the chute.

602
00:33:57,433 --> 00:33:59,504
He's riding that--

603
00:33:59,533 --> 00:34:00,910
B.B., what's shaking?

604
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:03,504
Come on, break yourself loose
and say hi to Johnny Walker.

605
00:34:03,534 --> 00:34:06,140
Johnny, captain of the team,
Bad Breath Banister.

606
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:07,475
Tough duty, B.B.

607
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,309
That boy's breath
would gag a maggot.

608
00:34:09,334 --> 00:34:11,336
I know it, Tex,
but he's gotta be...

609
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,107
Ladies and gents...

610
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:17,205
can I have your attention
for one minute?

611
00:34:17,233 --> 00:34:19,804
I want to introduce to you...

612
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:23,144
five of the most sought-after
football players...

613
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:26,080
in the entire country.

614
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,102
Boys, come on now.

615
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:29,510
Step up here.

616
00:34:34,267 --> 00:34:36,975
We want you! We want you!

617
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,946
And you're gonna get 'em!

618
00:34:38,967 --> 00:34:40,878
This here is Flick Weaver...

619
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,436
Pete Andropolous...

620
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:44,640
Benny Figg...

621
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:47,580
and that hunk
of Mexican-Samoan man flesh...

622
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,602
Jose Fopupu.

623
00:34:49,634 --> 00:34:53,207
And last, but not least,
Johnny "Rocket Arm" Walker.

624
00:34:53,233 --> 00:34:56,578
We want you! We want you!

625
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,013
Hail all to OI' Tex

626
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:03,447
Let the spirit lead

627
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:06,846
Hail all to OI' Tex

628
00:35:06,867 --> 00:35:10,212
On to victory

629
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:14,614
Our minds and hearts
are with you

630
00:35:14,633 --> 00:35:19,514
Your hallowed halls we praise

631
00:35:19,533 --> 00:35:22,537
Hail all to OI' Tex

632
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:27,243
All the live-long day

633
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,545
OI' Tex is great.

634
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:49,014
Yeah, but it can't come close
to the money Piermont offered.

635
00:35:49,034 --> 00:35:50,638
Man, only that
junk bond bullshit.

636
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:52,340
I'm splitting.

637
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:53,710
Where are you going?

638
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,611
I'm going to get some Chinese.

639
00:35:55,634 --> 00:35:57,204
Man, ain't you full yet,
brother?

640
00:35:57,234 --> 00:36:00,340
I'm not talking about food.
I told Tex I'd only come...

641
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:02,404
to visit if he got me
two Chinese girls.

642
00:36:02,434 --> 00:36:04,414
-Yo, Slick.
-He did!

643
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:06,811
Poontang foo-yang, hoss.

644
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:11,214
We're gonna show you
a real good time.

645
00:36:11,234 --> 00:36:12,577
How you doing, Carmen?

646
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,580
I'm glad to see you.
Ralph, what's up with you, man?

647
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,273
How you doing?
How's it feeling, man?

648
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,177
Yeah? Things looking up?

649
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,645
Aw, the stock market's down.

650
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:21,704
Stocks are down, huh?
How's your wife, man?

651
00:36:21,734 --> 00:36:22,712
Oh, fair.

652
00:36:22,734 --> 00:36:24,338
I need a partner.

653
00:36:24,367 --> 00:36:26,040
-Still picking pockets, man?
-Yeah.

654
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,904
lam here to tell you
that it is my responsibility...

655
00:36:36,934 --> 00:36:40,313
to welcome you
to the fold of OI' Tex.

656
00:36:40,334 --> 00:36:44,714
Sort of like a queen bee
with a hive...

657
00:36:44,734 --> 00:36:46,338
and I never miss.

658
00:36:46,367 --> 00:36:49,177
I got me a player
in every class.

659
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:55,713
In order to prepare you
for tonight's experience...

660
00:36:55,734 --> 00:36:57,805
we need to do a little
hot heart exercise.

661
00:36:57,834 --> 00:36:59,905
Now I'm gonna send you
some energy.

662
00:37:01,534 --> 00:37:02,808
Do you feel it?

663
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:04,279
Do you feel it?

664
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,109
I feel it. I feel good.

665
00:37:06,134 --> 00:37:08,637
-Do you feel the heat?
-I feel the heat.

666
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:11,011
OK, OK. I feel it, too.

667
00:37:11,034 --> 00:37:12,513
OK, now.

668
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:15,777
How'd you like to go
visit our campus?

669
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,837
Where the hell
is that campus, by the way?

670
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:19,972
Well, I'm glad you asked...

671
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,207
because I'm gonna
take you there right now.

672
00:37:22,234 --> 00:37:23,235
Thank you, ma'am.

673
00:37:23,267 --> 00:37:28,273
Well, let us grab
our drinks and vamoose.

674
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,677
Ooh, numero uno.

675
00:37:31,534 --> 00:37:33,605
lam going to show you,
you lucky boy...

676
00:37:33,634 --> 00:37:36,945
why they call us
the Horny Toads.

677
00:37:36,967 --> 00:37:40,744
Why, darling, this is far more
than a football team.

678
00:37:40,767 --> 00:37:42,075
Armadillo.

679
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,273
I mean, we have a very fine
medical program...

680
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,440
in which many operators
come out successfully.

681
00:37:47,467 --> 00:37:48,537
Oh, is that right?

682
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:50,308
Well, you understand
the word "operator"?

683
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:51,312
Not at all.

684
00:37:51,334 --> 00:37:53,336
-Was that your hand?
-That was yours.

685
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:56,439
Oh, well,
that was my hand, darling.

686
00:37:56,467 --> 00:38:01,280
I thought it was a pillow,
but I can see I was mistaken.

687
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,440
And as you can see,
we have a very fine library.

688
00:38:04,467 --> 00:38:05,707
Right. I can see that.

689
00:38:05,734 --> 00:38:09,079
Well, we'll see
the library now.

690
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,270
Excuse me.

691
00:38:18,134 --> 00:38:21,604
Listen, if you're
not interested in her...

692
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:25,639
I may know someone
a little more your speed.

693
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,610
Now, darling...

694
00:38:31,633 --> 00:38:36,104
I thought this would be
a more intimate place to dine.

695
00:38:36,134 --> 00:38:37,613
A little more spacious.

696
00:38:37,634 --> 00:38:39,944
I can't believe
the size of this campus.

697
00:38:39,967 --> 00:38:42,277
- It's huge.
- Well, you bet.

698
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,507
They're all gonna be saying it--
"Go, Johnny, go."

699
00:38:44,534 --> 00:38:48,107
In the fall, 80,000 people will
be cheering you on, darling.

700
00:38:48,134 --> 00:38:49,613
Johnny Walker!

701
00:38:49,634 --> 00:38:53,309
And I can guarantee you
something, sweetheart.

702
00:38:53,334 --> 00:38:54,677
It will be nothing...

703
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,180
like the performance
I am about to give.

704
00:38:59,134 --> 00:39:00,442
Oh, no.

705
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,044
Oh. Ouch.

706
00:39:05,067 --> 00:39:06,045
Oh, boink.

707
00:39:06,067 --> 00:39:07,478
Thank you so much.

708
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,774
Matter of fact...

709
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,371
I should start abusing
that term-thank you--

710
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,813
because it can get me
in and out of more situations...

711
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:16,574
with smooth sincerity.

712
00:39:18,067 --> 00:39:19,876
Absolutely the best thing
I could say...

713
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,311
is thank you right now.

714
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,176
Thank you and...

715
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,180
well, thank you. Thank you.

716
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,679
Darling, you talk too much.

717
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,179
Wait a minute. No, thank you.

718
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,202
See, I'm not the type
of guy who thinks--

719
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:32,236
-Joe Bob!
-Yo!

720
00:39:32,267 --> 00:39:34,679
Tell 'em about
the OI' Tex baby dolls...

721
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,671
and how they like to sneak
in the locker room at halftime.

722
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,680
Lord have mercy, boys.

723
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,681
We spend $20,000 a month on
these pretty little fillies...

724
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,180
just for the football
program alone.

725
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,804
You gonna like it here.

726
00:39:47,834 --> 00:39:52,180
Please stop. Stop.
l--thank you very much.

727
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,181
Miss, look, thank you. No.
You're making this hard enough.

728
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,543
Please stop.

729
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,042
Jose, come on down here, boy.
I wanna show you your future.

730
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:02,273
Ride 'em, cowboy!

731
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,280
Speaking of luxury,
if my eyes don't deceive me...

732
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,177
that's a boy getting
his knob polished...

733
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,873
right there
on the fifty-yard line.

734
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,970
Say what?

735
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,072
I gotta go, you understand?

736
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,104
Oh, wait! Where are you--
Don't leave!

737
00:40:15,134 --> 00:40:17,842
And |--stop!
Stop! Let me go.

738
00:40:17,867 --> 00:40:20,507
Oh, I gotta put this up
on the scoreboard...

739
00:40:20,534 --> 00:40:22,013
see it a little clearer.

740
00:40:23,234 --> 00:40:26,738
I have to go.
No, I'm not a homosexual.

741
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:28,678
I have to go.

742
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,179
No, you don't.

743
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,680
By God. I'll be dipped
in dog shit.

744
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,179
That's Johnny Walker.

745
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,679
What the--

746
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,510
Shit. That's my wife!

747
00:40:38,534 --> 00:40:39,979
That's your wife?

748
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,503
Who said that? Wait a minute.
Please. You have a husband?

749
00:40:42,534 --> 00:40:44,172
I'm getting out of here now.
This is it, and I'm out.

750
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,044
And put those tits away.
This was no med school.

751
00:40:47,067 --> 00:40:49,047
-This was not a library!
-I wanna play ball!

752
00:40:49,067 --> 00:40:50,205
I have to go!

753
00:40:50,234 --> 00:40:53,181
I won't put away my tits
before you get back here!

754
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,180
Come back here, you |i|' boy!

755
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,679
I gotta go! No, no!

756
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,203
Come back here!
I can make you feel good!

757
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:10,046
Get your butt
in this car, boy! Now!

758
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:11,546
Come on, let's go!

759
00:41:11,567 --> 00:41:13,046
You wanna go? Get in!

760
00:41:15,034 --> 00:41:17,014
Hey, don't be doing
that to the paint!

761
00:41:17,034 --> 00:41:19,514
Tex'll have my behind for that.

762
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:21,706
Don't be doing that.
Get in. Come on.

763
00:41:27,633 --> 00:41:30,045
Oh, so this is
the medical school.

764
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,276
Hey, boys, come on down here!

765
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,803
Got the entire front row
for y'all!

766
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,002
Oh, my gosh!

767
00:42:02,034 --> 00:42:03,138
It's looking very good!

768
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:04,168
Oh, no.

769
00:42:35,567 --> 00:42:37,547
Sure was nice of 0|‘ Tex
to let us use his car.

770
00:42:37,567 --> 00:42:40,707
Goddamn! It was nice of him
to give us his wife!

771
00:42:43,267 --> 00:42:45,941
- Fill 'er up?
- Yes, sir, with beer.

772
00:42:45,967 --> 00:42:47,412
<i>HEY-</i>

773
00:42:47,434 --> 00:42:49,573
Get you guys a beer
or maybe two.

774
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:52,375
How you doing?

775
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,210
-Doing good. How you doing?
-Good, good.

776
00:42:55,234 --> 00:42:57,771
You going to play football
at OI' Tex?

777
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,041
Oh, I don't know yet.

778
00:43:00,067 --> 00:43:03,048
You know, I used to be
a football player.

779
00:43:03,067 --> 00:43:05,479
They said I would've
been all-American...

780
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,537
if I hadn't hurt my leg.

781
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,479
What happened?

782
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,980
Did you go to OI' Tex?

783
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,344
I was going to, but...

784
00:43:15,367 --> 00:43:17,973
I never got the chance.

785
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,980
After they took
my scholarship away...

786
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,479
I had to quit school.

787
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,979
But...

788
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,776
OI' Tex took care of me,
got me this job.

789
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,838
I ain't complaining.

790
00:43:37,867 --> 00:43:38,971
<i>HEY-</i>

791
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,980
- Yeah, buddy.
- Party!

792
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,173
Yeah! Gonna party tonight!

793
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,241
What's this stuff, man?

794
00:43:54,367 --> 00:43:55,539
What is it?

795
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,741
That's Texas sushi, boy.

796
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:03,804
Forget you, man.

797
00:44:08,767 --> 00:44:10,405
Come on. We're out of here.

798
00:44:10,434 --> 00:44:11,913
Let's jam.

799
00:44:11,934 --> 00:44:12,969
Move it out! All right.

800
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:32,069
There he is!

801
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,842
Hey, Johnny,
why'd you visit OI' Tex?

802
00:44:34,867 --> 00:44:37,074
I need silence.
I need silence.

803
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,774
Why'd you go there
in the first place?

804
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,780
Come on, you're smarter
than that, Johnny.

805
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,108
I don't know. I don't know.

806
00:44:43,134 --> 00:44:46,775
Until you signed your letter,
nothing else means squat.

807
00:44:49,634 --> 00:44:51,238
Hey. Hello there.

808
00:44:51,267 --> 00:44:53,611
Hi, honey.

809
00:44:53,634 --> 00:44:55,614
How was the campus?

810
00:44:55,633 --> 00:44:57,078
The campus.

811
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,104
Right. It was nice, Mom.

812
00:45:00,134 --> 00:45:02,944
Yeah, it was nice.
It really was a nice campus.

813
00:45:02,967 --> 00:45:05,538
Well, you think of OI' Tex as
just a football school, right?

814
00:45:05,567 --> 00:45:06,773
And in actuality...

815
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,407
they have the finest
pre-med school in the country.

816
00:45:10,434 --> 00:45:13,347
Really. Just a fierce--
it was a beautiful setup.

817
00:45:13,367 --> 00:45:15,847
Yeah, it was nice.
It really was.

818
00:45:15,867 --> 00:45:20,009
Listen, something wonderful
happened while you were away.

819
00:45:20,034 --> 00:45:22,537
This fella calls up
on the telephone, see...

820
00:45:22,567 --> 00:45:26,014
and he orders 10,000
walleyed gibblers.

821
00:45:26,033 --> 00:45:27,444
Apparently
he gives them away...

822
00:45:27,467 --> 00:45:29,037
on his late-night
television show...

823
00:45:29,067 --> 00:45:32,674
like those Veg-a-matics or those
spiffy little fishing rods...

824
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,840
that turn into can openers.

825
00:45:35,867 --> 00:45:39,838
We could make a small fortune
on this deal, you know?

826
00:45:39,867 --> 00:45:41,847
That's excellent, Gramp.

827
00:45:41,867 --> 00:45:43,847
Yeah. So he called?

828
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:46,848
The fella says
so long as they sell...

829
00:45:46,867 --> 00:45:48,847
the orders
will just keep coming in.

830
00:45:48,867 --> 00:45:51,848
You know, we could maybe
buy a larger house.

831
00:45:51,867 --> 00:45:54,905
That'll really catch
a lot of fish.

832
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,977
- Hi, Johnny.
- Hey, Monica.

833
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,877
Don't you bruise
those tomatoes now.

834
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,970
Have you folks tried
those biscuits?

835
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,139
- They're delicious.
- What'd he say?

836
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:07,339
Pick a school yet, Johnny?

837
00:46:07,367 --> 00:46:09,142
Baby love.

838
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:12,114
Hey. How was it?

839
00:46:12,134 --> 00:46:16,105
It was cool. It was good.
I had a good time.

840
00:46:16,134 --> 00:46:18,307
Yeah?

841
00:46:18,334 --> 00:46:20,439
So how were the girls?

842
00:46:20,467 --> 00:46:23,346
The girls.

843
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:25,369
How were the girls?

844
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:28,369
Well, they were...

845
00:46:29,867 --> 00:46:31,540
very short...

846
00:46:31,567 --> 00:46:33,569
very fat...

847
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,841
and kinda weird looking.

848
00:46:35,867 --> 00:46:36,971
What was her name?

849
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,810
- Huh?
- What was her name?

850
00:46:41,967 --> 00:46:43,776
The woman I had dinner with
was Lawanda.

851
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,108
That was Tex's wife.

852
00:46:45,134 --> 00:46:46,442
Lawanda?

853
00:46:46,467 --> 00:46:49,209
Very old chick. Very fat woman.

854
00:46:49,233 --> 00:46:51,008
And very funny looking.

855
00:46:51,034 --> 00:46:54,015
She took me to dinner,
and, you know...

856
00:46:54,033 --> 00:46:58,482
"What do you think of Texas?"
And, you know, "I love it."

857
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,776
Lot of small talk.

858
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,939
I didn't--you know,
I didn't do anything...

859
00:47:02,967 --> 00:47:05,504
or, you know, touched her.

860
00:47:09,234 --> 00:47:11,145
What are you thinking about?

861
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,744
I think you're an asshole!

862
00:47:28,134 --> 00:47:30,740
This boy-girl shit hurts, man.

863
00:47:31,734 --> 00:47:34,214
Oh, no. None of that.

864
00:47:34,234 --> 00:47:36,714
It's a bogus product.
It's a payoff.

865
00:47:36,734 --> 00:47:39,908
No self-respecting fish would
go near a walleyed gibbler.

866
00:47:39,934 --> 00:47:42,710
Hey, Leo, read my lips.

867
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:44,714
Joe Bob promised
my grandfather...

868
00:47:44,734 --> 00:47:46,714
he'd by 10,000
of the things, OK?

869
00:47:46,734 --> 00:47:48,714
Dude, you're confused.
You're repeating yourself.

870
00:47:48,734 --> 00:47:51,146
- Maybe you're wrong.
- Well...

871
00:47:51,167 --> 00:47:53,909
I couldn't break his heart
like that.

872
00:47:53,934 --> 00:47:56,380
Well, you can't commit
to OI' Tex.

873
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,779
I'll tell you something, Leo,
I had such a groove in Texas.

874
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,438
I vomited margaritas
the whole way home...

875
00:48:01,467 --> 00:48:02,912
but it was beautiful.
I'm telling you.

876
00:48:02,933 --> 00:48:04,503
Well, perhaps
you'll spew forth...

877
00:48:04,534 --> 00:48:06,309
the drink of every school
you visit.

878
00:48:06,334 --> 00:48:07,972
I like that.
I'll keep it in mind.

879
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,673
Give me a hand. Howdy, Chief!

880
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,145
Dirtbags!

881
00:48:12,134 --> 00:48:16,173
UCC, UCC, UCC.

882
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,811
What's shaking, Coach?
I didn't know you'd show.

883
00:48:20,834 --> 00:48:22,973
Coach, how do you feel?

884
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,812
John, you promised me
you were gonna visit Piermont.

885
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:30,406
He's not going to Piermont.
You get it? Got it?

886
00:48:30,434 --> 00:48:31,777
And goose yourself.

887
00:48:33,667 --> 00:48:37,513
If I want any shit out of you,
Leo, I'll squeeze your head.

888
00:48:40,134 --> 00:48:42,876
You better listen to me, son.

889
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:46,973
You're on the verge of
destroying your entire career.

890
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,207
I'm not gonna let it happen.

891
00:48:49,233 --> 00:48:51,144
I'm gonna do
whatever it takes...

892
00:48:51,167 --> 00:48:53,545
to make sure you do
the right thing.

893
00:49:04,434 --> 00:49:05,970
You keep playing games
with me...

894
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,140
you're gonna end up waiting
on tables with this guy.

895
00:49:09,167 --> 00:49:11,579
That was cold-blooded, Coach.

896
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,706
- Coach, where's your shoes?
- Forgot those shoes, Coach.

897
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:19,280
Are you sure Tom won't want
to order more of my lures?

898
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:23,271
We haven't sold one
in three years.

899
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,679
Well, Harvey, you tell him that
a big shot down in Texas...

900
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,680
just ordered 10,000 of them.

901
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:32,546
Reckon the fish in that state
are gonna be safe for a while.

902
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,240
Grandpa Walker,
can I have a word with you?

903
00:49:59,267 --> 00:50:01,076
Sure, Coach. Sit down.

904
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,579
Got some bad news.

905
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,443
You know Tom Norman?

906
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:07,073
Well, he owns this shop.
Fishing buddy.

907
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,545
What's happened?

908
00:50:08,567 --> 00:50:10,205
Well, apparently
he's very connected...

909
00:50:10,234 --> 00:50:12,077
with some of the alumni
from Piermont.

910
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,171
Tom tells me that if Johnny
doesn't go to Fiermont...

911
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,545
he's gonna have to cut off
your credit here.

912
00:50:17,567 --> 00:50:21,071
Hey, I hear you're
flunking English. Ouch.

913
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,603
John, you need
that English, son.

914
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,408
You did your term paper...

915
00:50:32,433 --> 00:50:34,413
on the American
hardware store, huh?

916
00:50:34,434 --> 00:50:35,742
Maybe you deserved that

917
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:37,872
I don't want to hear about it.
It's a very legitimate topic.

918
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:41,006
- Yes, it is, and I must read it.
- I know you wanted to.

919
00:50:41,034 --> 00:50:43,605
So, Leo, I think you know
why we're here today.

920
00:50:43,634 --> 00:50:45,409
I think you do.

921
00:50:45,434 --> 00:50:47,573
Hisler's been messing
with me, Leo.

922
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,080
He's been messing
with my grandfather...

923
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,580
been messing
with my little brother...

924
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,102
my little sister.

925
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,910
Been messing with my mom, Leo.

926
00:50:57,934 --> 00:51:01,575
He's been talking to her,
messing with her.

927
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,580
And now...

928
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,341
we're gonna mess with him, Leo.

929
00:51:05,367 --> 00:51:06,505
Are you with me?

930
00:51:06,534 --> 00:51:07,808
Die!

931
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:11,809
Gonna ruin his life

932
00:51:11,834 --> 00:51:13,677
Gonna ruin it good

933
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,509
Gonna do the wrong thing

934
00:51:15,533 --> 00:51:17,012
Like I thought I could

935
00:51:17,033 --> 00:51:19,309
Oh, Leo, vengeance is mine.
Made all the calls, did you?

936
00:51:19,334 --> 00:51:21,507
It all comes together now.

937
00:51:21,533 --> 00:51:24,104
Wait till you see
these chihuahuas.

938
00:51:25,867 --> 00:51:28,040
Hut, hut, hut.

939
00:51:31,533 --> 00:51:34,013
Hello, John.
Glad you boys came by.

940
00:51:34,034 --> 00:51:36,014
The wife has
a Tupperware party...

941
00:51:36,033 --> 00:51:38,013
but we can talk in the den
if you like.

942
00:51:38,034 --> 00:51:39,513
I'd appreciate that, Coach.

943
00:51:39,534 --> 00:51:42,037
- Come right in, please.
- Thank you. Thank you.

944
00:51:42,067 --> 00:51:45,014
It has a green lid.

945
00:51:45,034 --> 00:51:46,513
It has blue.

946
00:51:46,534 --> 00:51:49,811
It has...purple.
See that purple?

947
00:51:49,834 --> 00:51:53,281
You boys met my children
before-Sugar and Honey?

948
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,335
Oh, I love your kids.

949
00:51:54,367 --> 00:51:55,846
I've been giving
a lot of thought...

950
00:51:55,867 --> 00:51:57,676
to what you told me
about Piermont. I really have.

951
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,577
That's good.

952
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,602
Except I'm having a little
problem with my English grade.

953
00:52:01,633 --> 00:52:03,510
Really?

954
00:52:03,533 --> 00:52:05,945
Yeah. I thought you could help.

955
00:52:05,967 --> 00:52:10,006
I might be able
to help you out with that. Sure.

956
00:52:10,034 --> 00:52:11,707
I thought you could, Coach.

957
00:52:13,967 --> 00:52:15,105
Stick with me, Johnny.

958
00:52:15,134 --> 00:52:18,115
- More company, honey?
- Don't get up, Pumpkin.

959
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:21,445
- Keep selling your goods.
- OK, now, I have...

960
00:52:21,467 --> 00:52:23,105
Pizza delivery for Hitler.

961
00:52:23,134 --> 00:52:24,977
Hitler? Hisler. Hisler.

962
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,412
Where you going?
Wait a minute, fellas.

963
00:52:27,433 --> 00:52:29,435
Wait a minute.
I didn't order any pizza.

964
00:52:29,467 --> 00:52:32,277
$283.
- No, it won't be $283.

965
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,802
I didn't order any pizza.

966
00:52:33,833 --> 00:52:35,813
Look, pal, you order pizza,
we bring you pizza.

967
00:52:35,834 --> 00:52:37,609
- Hey, listen, you like pizza?
- Sure.

968
00:52:37,634 --> 00:52:41,241
Yeah, you like it? All right.
You eat the pizza!

969
00:52:43,834 --> 00:52:45,711
What are you doing?

970
00:52:45,734 --> 00:52:48,271
Can't you take a joke, mister?

971
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,110
Go back!
Connie, get my shotgun!

972
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,304
Honey, I'm coming!

973
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:56,438
Can I have the rest
of the pizzas?

974
00:53:05,067 --> 00:53:06,546
Is it for me?

975
00:53:06,567 --> 00:53:09,013
No! It's for nobody!
Get out of here now!

976
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:17,707
Whoa! Wait a minute!
Where you going?

977
00:53:17,734 --> 00:53:19,407
I'm from D.O.A. Exterminators.

978
00:53:19,434 --> 00:53:21,277
Hear you got a problem
with rodents.

979
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,041
I got no rodents!

980
00:53:23,067 --> 00:53:24,705
I'm gonna take care
of my own rodents.

981
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:26,771
Out, out, out!

982
00:53:32,067 --> 00:53:35,105
Coach, we're even now.

983
00:53:35,134 --> 00:53:36,704
How do you turn this thing off?

984
00:53:36,734 --> 00:53:37,804
Come on. Out.

985
00:53:38,834 --> 00:53:40,404
Connie, where are you?

986
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,407
Number one.

987
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,504
That's your number.

988
00:54:35,534 --> 00:54:37,480
Yeah, I was really surprised.

989
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,502
No kidding, yeah.

990
00:54:40,667 --> 00:54:42,578
Definitely want
to see him, yeah.

991
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,809
Fast like Homer Jones.
Remember Homer?

992
00:54:45,834 --> 00:54:48,405
Yeah, yeah.
Heck of a student.

993
00:54:48,433 --> 00:54:50,913
95 average--that's great.

994
00:54:50,934 --> 00:54:52,413
Let's have dinner next Tuesday.

995
00:54:52,434 --> 00:54:55,074
I gotta go.
Next Tuesday, OK?

996
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,704
I really have to go. Bye-bye.

997
00:54:56,734 --> 00:55:00,978
What do you say, Coach?
How do you feel?

998
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,914
Would you mind removing
your feet from my desk, please?

999
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:07,312
Thank you.

1000
00:55:07,334 --> 00:55:10,247
So, I came here to do some
business with you today, sir.

1001
00:55:10,267 --> 00:55:11,746
I just got back from OI' Tex.

1002
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:14,407
They're ready to cut a sweet
and lucrative deal with me...

1003
00:55:14,434 --> 00:55:16,380
except the thing is,
I want to play here.

1004
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,936
I want to come to State.

1005
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,137
Johnny, we don't
give out deals here.

1006
00:55:24,434 --> 00:55:26,414
What?

1007
00:55:26,433 --> 00:55:30,438
We give the usual scholarship:
Room and board...

1008
00:55:30,467 --> 00:55:32,413
a good education.

1009
00:55:32,434 --> 00:55:35,904
Everyone has to actually
go to class here.

1010
00:55:35,934 --> 00:55:37,914
And I like to believe...

1011
00:55:37,933 --> 00:55:40,174
that we offer a good background
in football.

1012
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,146
We had a lot of players
go into pro ball.

1013
00:55:42,167 --> 00:55:45,944
That's nice, Coach, but...

1014
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:48,004
you're losing the top
high school athletes...

1015
00:55:48,034 --> 00:55:50,344
every year for a reason.

1016
00:55:50,367 --> 00:55:51,869
What's that?

1017
00:55:54,034 --> 00:55:55,672
Well, you're not
giving them anything.

1018
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:57,839
You gotta show them something.
They gotta see something.

1019
00:55:57,867 --> 00:55:59,505
They gotta know that
they're gonna get something--

1020
00:55:59,534 --> 00:56:03,346
cash, you know,
cars, apartments, money.

1021
00:56:03,367 --> 00:56:05,506
Hook-ups, you know what I mean?

1022
00:56:05,534 --> 00:56:08,208
We're looking for benefits
these days, Coach.

1023
00:56:08,233 --> 00:56:11,339
Look, Johnny, I like you...

1024
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:14,348
so I'm not gonna B.S. you.

1025
00:56:14,367 --> 00:56:15,846
You're a good athlete.

1026
00:56:15,867 --> 00:56:19,838
You have a lot of talent
and a lot of energy.

1027
00:56:19,867 --> 00:56:21,505
So I'm warning you...

1028
00:56:21,534 --> 00:56:24,140
you're getting into something
that you don't understand.

1029
00:56:24,167 --> 00:56:27,011
See, when word goes out
that a kid like yourself...

1030
00:56:27,033 --> 00:56:28,740
is looking for a deal...

1031
00:56:28,767 --> 00:56:31,873
believe me, that deal turns out
to be a lot stronger...

1032
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,641
than that kid
ever bargained for.

1033
00:56:35,367 --> 00:56:36,846
Be careful.

1034
00:56:36,867 --> 00:56:38,710
You're playing with fire.

1035
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,302
Are you crazy?

1036
00:57:11,334 --> 00:57:14,213
My father sleeps with his gun.

1037
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:19,472
I heard you visited State.

1038
00:57:22,967 --> 00:57:25,641
Does this mean
your lobotomy's worn off?

1039
00:57:29,634 --> 00:57:31,272
Well...

1040
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:36,477
since you're not going to speak,
you will rub my feet.

1041
00:57:39,967 --> 00:57:42,413
I mean, far be it for me
to ask you to apologize...

1042
00:57:42,434 --> 00:57:45,608
when you have behaved like
a complete son of a bitch...

1043
00:57:45,634 --> 00:57:47,238
but...

1044
00:58:11,067 --> 00:58:14,879
"Flowers that have festered
smell far worse than weeds."

1045
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,745
That means...you stink.

1046
00:58:23,234 --> 00:58:24,907
But it was sweet.

1047
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,038
I guess
lam still sweet on you.

1048
00:58:29,067 --> 00:58:31,547
I'll cut in ten minutes.

1049
00:58:31,567 --> 00:58:33,706
You're a bombshell.

1050
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:41,641
<i>“Cc!</i>

1051
00:58:41,667 --> 00:58:44,580
- We're going to 0l' Tex.
- No, we're not.

1052
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,079
People in Texas...

1053
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,579
sorry-

1054
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,601
Cool.

1055
00:58:53,234 --> 00:58:55,578
No real shots!
No real shots!

1056
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,601
Punk!

1057
00:59:00,767 --> 00:59:03,145
- You wouldn't really use that.
- Yes, I would.

1058
00:59:03,167 --> 00:59:06,114
- No, you're not gonna use that.
- Yes, I would.

1059
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,579
Leo.

1060
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,079
What?

1061
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:13,274
What do you really want
out of life, huh?

1062
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,372
I want Johnny Walker
to go to California.

1063
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:22,011
- All right, I'll go.
- Really?

1064
00:59:22,034 --> 00:59:23,672
- Yeah.
- Cool.

1065
01:00:06,367 --> 01:00:10,440
Hey, how you doing, Johnny?
Lew Landers, l.C.A.

1066
01:00:10,467 --> 01:00:12,071
It's good to see you.
Welcome to California.

1067
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,841
We got a fine time
planned for you, buddy.

1068
01:00:13,867 --> 01:00:16,006
Listen, Lew, I'm here
to meet the money man.

1069
01:00:16,034 --> 01:00:17,445
I'm here on business,
not pleasure.

1070
01:00:17,467 --> 01:00:19,310
I am the money man, Johnny.

1071
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:21,370
And I'll tell you something.
I'm gonna take you to meet...

1072
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,970
the best quarterback
in the country...

1073
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,502
a close personal friend
of mine.

1074
01:00:24,534 --> 01:00:26,844
Give me five, Johnny.
Never touch.

1075
01:00:45,534 --> 01:00:49,107
Jim McMahon wears Adidas.

1076
01:01:00,134 --> 01:01:01,772
Either I wear Adidas...

1077
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,302
or I wear nothing.

1078
01:01:05,134 --> 01:01:06,943
Almost nothing.

1079
01:01:06,967 --> 01:01:11,643
And cut!
Great. Beautiful. Amazing.

1080
01:01:11,667 --> 01:01:13,772
Here you go, Jim.

1081
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,677
I don't know how you do it,
Jimmy. Every time.

1082
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:16,678
Natural talent.

1083
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,611
Back to the golf course
again, huh?

1084
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:20,772
- The rest of you--thank you.
- Just one more, Jim.

1085
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,110
- Hey, Yeoman, thanks a lot, man.
- You bet, boss.

1086
01:01:23,133 --> 01:01:25,306
Thanks, Bob.

1087
01:01:25,334 --> 01:01:28,941
Jimmy, how you doing?
Meet Johnny Walker.

1088
01:01:28,967 --> 01:01:30,275
What's up, Jim?

1089
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:31,779
How you doing, John?

1090
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,212
Glad to see
you're coming to UCC.

1091
01:01:34,234 --> 01:01:36,236
Well, I haven't really
made up my mind yet...

1092
01:01:36,267 --> 01:01:39,146
but I'm damn glad
to meet you, man.

1093
01:01:39,167 --> 01:01:41,204
I'm having a little party
for my man tonight.

1094
01:01:41,233 --> 01:01:42,769
Why don't you stop by
the house, huh?

1095
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,303
Well, I'd love to,
but I promised my wife...

1096
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:47,940
I wouldn't show up
at your place anymore.

1097
01:01:49,734 --> 01:01:52,237
What a kidder, huh?
I love you, Jimmy.

1098
01:01:52,267 --> 01:01:54,440
Hey, maybe next time,
huh, babe?

1099
01:01:55,733 --> 01:01:57,110
- Hey, Lew.
- Yeah?

1100
01:01:57,134 --> 01:01:59,273
Did you notice how he had
his hair done up like that?

1101
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:00,438
Yeah. Looks good.

1102
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:02,276
Just like mine.
Like he planned it for me.

1103
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,938
Listen, let me tell you
something serious, huh?

1104
01:02:03,967 --> 01:02:05,275
You play your cards right...

1105
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:06,938
you could be the next
Adidas man someday.

1106
01:02:06,967 --> 01:02:09,277
Lew, he had his hair hooked up
just like mine.

1107
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,770
1:45--Walker receives
jacket from Landers.

1108
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:13,972
Over and out.

1109
01:02:19,667 --> 01:02:22,876
I know I may talk 90%
of the time, Johnny...

1110
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:26,507
but, believe me,
I only take 10% of the action.

1111
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:29,344
- How you doing, Doc?
- Terrific, Lew, terrific.

1112
01:02:32,367 --> 01:02:34,677
- Lewie.
- Yeah?

1113
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:37,112
My mother's medicine cabinet
was never like this.

1114
01:02:37,133 --> 01:02:40,342
Don't worry about it, Johnny.
You're not in Ashcroft anymore.

1115
01:02:40,367 --> 01:02:42,973
We use only the finest
steroids available.

1116
01:02:44,067 --> 01:02:47,105
We have only one mind-set
here at UCC...

1117
01:02:47,134 --> 01:02:48,977
and that is that
our boys are winners.

1118
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,037
- Isn't that right, boys?
- Right!

1119
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:53,946
I love these guys like my own
kids, and because of that...

1120
01:02:53,967 --> 01:02:56,504
I take better care of them
than their own mommies do.

1121
01:02:56,534 --> 01:02:59,208
- Isn't that right, boys?
- Right!

1122
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:01,145
We have the best
training facilities...

1123
01:03:01,167 --> 01:03:03,147
in the country, Johnny,
college or pro.

1124
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,475
Our men are appreciated...

1125
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,878
for the fine pieces
of machinery that they are.

1126
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,675
- What's up, Slick?
- Hey.

1127
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:09,804
Does he play here?

1128
01:03:09,834 --> 01:03:11,438
No, he just pisses
for the players...

1129
01:03:11,467 --> 01:03:13,071
so they pass their drug tests.

1130
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:15,307
- A designated pisser, huh?
- Yeah.

1131
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,279
Let's get you some threads
for the party.

1132
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:18,506
All right.

1133
01:03:18,533 --> 01:03:19,773
Lew, how tall are you?

1134
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,801
<i>About 5'8“.</i>

1135
01:03:44,434 --> 01:03:47,040
Hi, I'm Tex Wade.
I'm looking for Johnny Walker.

1136
01:03:47,067 --> 01:03:50,276
Oh. Well, he hasn't got
back from UCC yet.

1137
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:54,043
The hell's he doing at UCC?
Isn't he committed to OI' Tex?

1138
01:03:54,067 --> 01:03:57,708
As far as I know, he hasn't
committed himself anywhere.

1139
01:03:57,734 --> 01:04:01,614
Well, I hate to be the one
to enlighten you, Grandpa...

1140
01:04:01,633 --> 01:04:03,544
but you did not get
that order...

1141
01:04:03,567 --> 01:04:05,808
for them 10,000
walleyed gibblers...

1142
01:04:05,834 --> 01:04:07,814
because they catch fish.

1143
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:11,709
What are you saying, mister?

1144
01:04:11,734 --> 01:04:14,510
You figure it out, Grandpa.

1145
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,673
Ah, it's good to be home.

1146
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,338
Thanks, everybody. Thank you.

1147
01:04:34,067 --> 01:04:35,273
Thank you.

1148
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:36,506
Hey, it's Johnny Walker.

1149
01:04:41,834 --> 01:04:42,938
Thank you.

1150
01:04:49,633 --> 01:04:51,271
This is a nice ride.
This is all right.

1151
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:53,280
Where'd you get it, anyway?
My dad got it for me.

1152
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:55,541
Kind of a graduation present
type thing.

1153
01:04:55,567 --> 01:04:58,673
I thought I knew
your father hated you.

1154
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:01,271
Well, he used to,
but we're real tight now.

1155
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,371
Just kind of
woke up one morning...

1156
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,313
we had breakfast, and now,
you know, real solid.

1157
01:05:06,334 --> 01:05:07,711
Things are real good.

1158
01:05:07,733 --> 01:05:11,112
I look cleaner than
the board of health, don't I?

1159
01:05:11,134 --> 01:05:13,944
You kind of look like a combo--

1160
01:05:13,967 --> 01:05:17,005
Liberace meets Prince's mom.
But it's groovy.

1161
01:05:30,667 --> 01:05:32,203
Bye now.

1162
01:05:36,434 --> 01:05:37,879
What's happening, Chief?

1163
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:41,712
Where did you finally decide
to go to college, clown school?

1164
01:05:41,734 --> 01:05:45,307
You know what you are, Chief?
You're an officer of love.

1165
01:05:45,334 --> 01:05:47,177
Not of law-of love, you are.

1166
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:56,902
Do you dig it?

1167
01:05:58,234 --> 01:05:59,508
It's a look.

1168
01:06:28,634 --> 01:06:32,104
Mom, Mom,
Johnny's lost his mind!

1169
01:06:42,267 --> 01:06:43,871
What do you think?

1170
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,339
Mom, I got to tell you
about this school.

1171
01:06:47,367 --> 01:06:51,747
UCC has a premed program--
absolutely blows OI' Tex away.

1172
01:06:51,767 --> 01:06:54,543
Not even in the running anymore,
OI' Tex, because you know why?

1173
01:06:54,567 --> 01:06:57,946
I'm gonna get about 3 times
the lab time I had at OI' Tex.

1174
01:06:57,967 --> 01:07:01,176
Johnny,
what has happened to you?

1175
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,373
Me? I'm great.
Don't I look great?

1176
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,607
I feel great, Mom. I really do.

1177
01:07:05,634 --> 01:07:08,274
UCC is a football factory,
Johnny.

1178
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:10,302
Only about half the players
there even graduate.

1179
01:07:10,334 --> 01:07:11,836
What about your education?

1180
01:07:12,867 --> 01:07:14,608
Ma, education? Please, OK?

1181
01:07:14,634 --> 01:07:16,978
Just, please,
step off with that, OK?

1182
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,206
I want to tell you something.

1183
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:19,975
I have a much better deal
here at UCC.

1184
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,343
They're working out
a sweeter deal...

1185
01:07:21,367 --> 01:07:23,369
and they're gonna take
care of everything, guys.

1186
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,210
The way OI' Tex
took care of me?

1187
01:07:28,533 --> 01:07:31,639
Come on, look, everyone
looks nauseous here now.

1188
01:07:31,667 --> 01:07:34,773
I want to explain to you, OK?
UCC has a better deal for me.

1189
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,714
They're going to hook us up.
Mom, you'll have a bigger house.

1190
01:07:38,734 --> 01:07:40,714
I don't want
a bigger house, Johnny.

1191
01:07:40,734 --> 01:07:42,577
I want you to stop
thinking about yourself...

1192
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,079
and start thinking about
what's right...

1193
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:46,876
and about your family.
We're the people who love you...

1194
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:49,107
or maybe you've been
too busy Lear-jetting around...

1195
01:07:49,134 --> 01:07:50,272
to remember that.

1196
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:53,873
I mean, look at you.
Purple and gold?

1197
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:55,402
You look ridiculous.

1198
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:00,104
I don't know how
this could've happened.

1199
01:08:00,133 --> 01:08:03,808
Maybe it was just too important
a decision to leave up to you.

1200
01:08:03,834 --> 01:08:07,043
Hey, Mom, wait a second.
Mom, can we--

1201
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,143
Come on, Gramps.
Isn't this what you wanted?

1202
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:22,279
I wanted to sell my lures,
not my grandson.

1203
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:23,802
Come on.

1204
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:27,773
Gramp.

1205
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,143
Gramp.

1206
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:39,678
What do you think, Randy?
Come on, what's up?

1207
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:43,671
I'm going to go do my homework
and take a reality break.

1208
01:08:59,134 --> 01:09:01,205
Johnny, I've had a deep,
revelatory vision...

1209
01:09:01,234 --> 01:09:04,272
and I think you should drop this
ridiculous college ball thing.

1210
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:05,574
And do what?

1211
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,809
Become a professional waiter.
Develop a reputation...

1212
01:09:08,834 --> 01:09:11,405
as a bistro's
most courteous server.

1213
01:09:11,434 --> 01:09:13,345
And, of course,
you're waiting for one night...

1214
01:09:13,367 --> 01:09:15,210
when the manager's
relatives come in.

1215
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:18,010
You seat them. You serve them.
You wine them. You dine them.

1216
01:09:18,034 --> 01:09:19,911
You read them the specials.

1217
01:09:19,934 --> 01:09:22,437
You take the last of their
orders, and then you say...

1218
01:09:22,467 --> 01:09:26,005
"Actually, it's the fish
or nothing!"

1219
01:09:26,034 --> 01:09:27,411
Of course, at this point...

1220
01:09:27,434 --> 01:09:28,845
they're all jamming
for the door like wild.

1221
01:09:28,867 --> 01:09:30,437
You tackle down around
the ankles.

1222
01:09:30,467 --> 01:09:32,708
You get them down on the ground.
You pound them in the spine.

1223
01:09:32,734 --> 01:09:34,441
You say,
"Are you trying to stiff me...

1224
01:09:34,467 --> 01:09:35,946
"on the gratuity, you fop?"

1225
01:09:35,967 --> 01:09:37,207
Right.

1226
01:09:37,234 --> 01:09:39,874
UCC is your only move

1227
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:43,541
UCC is your evermost groove

1228
01:09:43,567 --> 01:09:46,104
Excuse me.
We're new in town...

1229
01:09:46,134 --> 01:09:48,512
and we've never had sex before.

1230
01:09:48,534 --> 01:09:50,411
Would you give us a hand?

1231
01:09:51,634 --> 01:09:52,635
Up.

1232
01:09:52,667 --> 01:09:54,510
Don't follow the dames.

1233
01:09:59,101 --> 01:10:02,048
Leo. Leo, turn--
I want to go home.

1234
01:10:02,067 --> 01:10:04,274
I started dating
this Nancy girl...

1235
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:07,474
specifically because
she was a virgin.

1236
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:11,243
Well, milliseconds before
initial penetration...

1237
01:10:11,267 --> 01:10:15,306
I just shot up in bed
like a reverse domino...

1238
01:10:15,334 --> 01:10:18,440
and I just said,
"Hey, there'll be none of this.

1239
01:10:18,467 --> 01:10:20,208
"What kind of boy
do you think I am?

1240
01:10:20,234 --> 01:10:22,874
"I will hardly pop you
without having met your father.

1241
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:24,811
"Get him on the horn."

1242
01:10:24,834 --> 01:10:29,044
The things that make life worth
so much and so worthwhile...

1243
01:10:29,067 --> 01:10:32,810
are things that we have to
look up at a lot of the time--

1244
01:10:32,834 --> 01:10:35,144
it's clouds, it's stars...

1245
01:10:35,167 --> 01:10:36,271
children.

1246
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,007
"By the way, where is the can?

1247
01:10:38,034 --> 01:10:42,779
"I have to take an awful,
putrid asparagus piss."

1248
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,541
He says, "Down the hall
to the left."

1249
01:10:44,567 --> 01:10:47,013
That just really ticked me off,
so I got up and I said...

1250
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:49,480
"Just a goddamn minute.
That won't do."

1251
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,411
I run right up
to the family drapes...

1252
01:10:51,434 --> 01:10:54,210
and proceed to write
my surname on them in urine.

1253
01:10:54,234 --> 01:10:56,271
Well, Mom bolts out
of the La-Z-Boy chair...

1254
01:10:56,301 --> 01:10:59,612
and comes over and delivers me
a flurry of slaps...

1255
01:10:59,634 --> 01:11:01,443
so I retaliate
with a series of blows...

1256
01:11:01,467 --> 01:11:04,209
to her midriff and midsection
that I usually reserve...

1257
01:11:04,234 --> 01:11:06,771
only for those times
when I actually do see red.

1258
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,609
I'm a winner.

1259
01:11:08,634 --> 01:11:11,615
I am, and so all these
big money men...

1260
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:14,012
they're offering me this,
this, this, and this, you know?

1261
01:11:14,034 --> 01:11:17,140
Because I came home wearing,
like, heels and gold.

1262
01:11:17,167 --> 01:11:20,580
My mother sat me down and she
told me what the deal was...

1263
01:11:20,601 --> 01:11:23,309
you know, and spoke her mind,
and I've been acting crazy.

1264
01:11:23,334 --> 01:11:24,472
I really have.

1265
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:27,208
Are you still conscious?

1266
01:11:27,234 --> 01:11:28,736
She's talking. Good.

1267
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:34,302
Let her go. It's been an hour.

1268
01:11:34,334 --> 01:11:37,838
Look, I seem to have
lockjaw of the arm.

1269
01:11:43,001 --> 01:11:45,481
Love is a verb, and I wish...

1270
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:48,242
I wish I'd just
get to it a lot more...

1271
01:11:48,267 --> 01:11:50,804
because I feel good when I do.

1272
01:11:50,834 --> 01:11:54,145
Say, are we going
to have sex or not?

1273
01:12:04,034 --> 01:12:05,138
Rape!

1274
01:12:05,167 --> 01:12:06,544
Rape!

1275
01:12:09,834 --> 01:12:11,177
Put your top on!

1276
01:12:13,334 --> 01:12:14,574
Freeze, assholes!

1277
01:12:15,567 --> 01:12:18,343
- This is too good to be true.
- For who?

1278
01:12:19,367 --> 01:12:22,314
You're going
to the joint forever.

1279
01:12:23,967 --> 01:12:26,004
What are you looking at,
weirdo?

1280
01:12:26,034 --> 01:12:27,069
Ouch.

1281
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,202
We got to get out of here.

1282
01:12:34,534 --> 01:12:37,014
Look, Lew Landers
can get us out of here, right?

1283
01:12:37,034 --> 01:12:41,881
- But then you got to go to UCC.
- Wait a minute.

1284
01:12:41,901 --> 01:12:43,312
You know Lew Landers?

1285
01:12:44,434 --> 01:12:46,778
Of course. You think my dad
bought me that Jeep?

1286
01:12:46,801 --> 01:12:49,008
Are you kidding?
Lew Landers bought me the jeep.

1287
01:12:49,034 --> 01:12:52,481
UCC got it for me to try to get
you to go to their school.

1288
01:12:55,467 --> 01:12:58,744
- You set me up?
- No, I didn't set you up.

1289
01:12:58,767 --> 01:13:00,474
I just pushed you
in a direction...

1290
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,037
trying to do
the right thing for you.

1291
01:13:03,067 --> 01:13:04,478
You set me up.
You didn't tell me.

1292
01:13:04,501 --> 01:13:07,141
If I told you, you would've
said no, and then...

1293
01:13:07,167 --> 01:13:08,703
well, then, it still wouldn't
have been setting you up.

1294
01:13:08,734 --> 01:13:10,236
I just, you know...

1295
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,311
I just made a mistake.

1296
01:13:13,334 --> 01:13:15,143
I got...

1297
01:13:17,467 --> 01:13:18,810
selfish.

1298
01:13:21,267 --> 01:13:22,473
Me, too.

1299
01:13:31,067 --> 01:13:33,843
Oh, this is terrible.
This is awful.

1300
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:36,143
This is really awful.

1301
01:13:36,167 --> 01:13:38,374
This is a serious mess.

1302
01:13:38,401 --> 01:13:40,642
Does the phrase
"Bail us out immediately"...

1303
01:13:40,667 --> 01:13:41,907
mean anything to you?

1304
01:13:41,934 --> 01:13:43,004
Bail?

1305
01:13:44,334 --> 01:13:45,438
There's your bail.

1306
01:13:45,467 --> 01:13:48,448
That's your ticket
out of here right there.

1307
01:13:48,467 --> 01:13:50,447
All he has to do
is sign with Fiermont--

1308
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:51,639
you're on the street.

1309
01:13:51,667 --> 01:13:53,374
Otherwise, boys...

1310
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,380
you're looking at twenty years
in the slammer...

1311
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,038
with all the butt pirates.

1312
01:13:57,067 --> 01:13:59,274
And they say they're waiting
for you up there, Johnny...

1313
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:02,612
want to give you a little
hiney poke up there.

1314
01:14:02,634 --> 01:14:04,443
Coach, I know I'm a man, OK?

1315
01:14:04,467 --> 01:14:06,071
My asshole is exit only...

1316
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:08,774
and we really didn't do
anything wrong.

1317
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,108
You want sympathy, Leo...

1318
01:14:10,134 --> 01:14:13,775
you look between "shit" and
"syphilis" in the dictionary.

1319
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:16,076
No, no, you're gonna like it.
You're going to love it...

1320
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:19,047
on the road gang, out there with
the cons cutting that grass.

1321
01:14:19,067 --> 01:14:20,045
Oh, yeah.

1322
01:14:20,067 --> 01:14:21,978
Boom. Boom.

1323
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,310
All the pretty girls will be
going by in convertibles...

1324
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:27,338
on spring break, drinking beer.

1325
01:14:27,367 --> 01:14:30,780
They'll be waving at you.
"Hi, Johnny. Johnny!"

1326
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:33,269
It's up to you, John.

1327
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:36,213
Put your foot
in the chain gang...

1328
01:14:36,234 --> 01:14:38,942
or you can put your foot
in the cash register.

1329
01:14:40,067 --> 01:14:42,343
You let me know.

1330
01:14:44,334 --> 01:14:46,336
Don't drop the soap, boys.

1331
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:53,046
Hello, everyone.
I'm Gary DeLaune.

1332
01:14:53,067 --> 01:14:55,047
Today, throughout the country,
hundreds of boys...

1333
01:14:55,067 --> 01:14:57,138
will be signing their national
letters of intent.

1334
01:14:57,167 --> 01:14:59,738
These letters are commitments
by high school seniors...

1335
01:14:59,767 --> 01:15:01,576
to play for the college
of their choice.

1336
01:15:01,601 --> 01:15:03,706
Today, there's no place
across the country...

1337
01:15:03,734 --> 01:15:05,873
that has more media coverage
and more attention...

1338
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:07,608
than right here--
Ashcroft High School.

1339
01:15:07,634 --> 01:15:09,204
We're here at Ashcroft
High School.

1340
01:15:09,234 --> 01:15:10,372
It's signing day.

1341
01:15:10,401 --> 01:15:12,472
Now, Johnny Walker
has just arrived...

1342
01:15:12,501 --> 01:15:14,481
to sign his national
letter of intent.

1343
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,275
In just a very few
short moments...

1344
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:18,644
the entire country will know
where Johnny Walker...

1345
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:21,341
has decided to play
his college football.

1346
01:15:21,367 --> 01:15:24,473
Glad to see you boys could
be here for the announcement.

1347
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,776
I sure hope none of us
are disappointed.

1348
01:15:26,801 --> 01:15:30,112
Something sure
don't smell right here.

1349
01:15:33,401 --> 01:15:35,403
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1350
01:15:35,434 --> 01:15:38,938
I'm very happy to have been
asked, ladies and gentlemen...

1351
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:41,106
to introduce Johnny Walker
here today.

1352
01:15:41,134 --> 01:15:45,173
And I am so happy
to announce...

1353
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:48,340
that John and I are going to be
together for another four years.

1354
01:15:48,367 --> 01:15:51,371
I'm the new head coach
at Piermont University.

1355
01:15:53,734 --> 01:15:55,805
But, you know, what really
makes me proud...

1356
01:15:55,834 --> 01:15:58,007
is that John could've gone
anywhere in America...

1357
01:15:58,034 --> 01:15:59,809
and he chose to be with me.

1358
01:15:59,834 --> 01:16:01,074
Now, we've also landed...

1359
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:04,513
four of the top blue-chip
prospects in this country...

1360
01:16:04,534 --> 01:16:06,639
and they're all here today.
Come on up, fellas.

1361
01:16:09,834 --> 01:16:11,973
You need a haircut.

1362
01:16:12,001 --> 01:16:13,503
All right.

1363
01:16:15,334 --> 01:16:17,007
This is not about me.

1364
01:16:17,034 --> 01:16:19,537
I'm only as good
as my players, believe me.

1365
01:16:19,567 --> 01:16:21,046
Ladies and gentlemen,
let me introduce...

1366
01:16:21,067 --> 01:16:23,069
the man of the hour,
Johnny Walker.

1367
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,908
<i>'Iay! 'lay!</i>

1368
01:16:41,934 --> 01:16:43,709
Throughout this recruitment...

1369
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:47,744
I've acted like an idiot.

1370
01:16:47,767 --> 01:16:50,008
I completely embarrassed
my mother...

1371
01:16:50,034 --> 01:16:52,310
my family, my girlfriend...

1372
01:16:52,334 --> 01:16:54,575
my friends.

1373
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:57,103
Mostly, I just
embarrassed myself...

1374
01:16:59,367 --> 01:17:03,713
because I thought
I had something, and I lost it.

1375
01:17:03,734 --> 01:17:07,511
And if this is what it takes
to play college football...

1376
01:17:07,534 --> 01:17:11,311
then I don't even want
to play at all.

1377
01:17:11,334 --> 01:17:16,841
Just because I know how
to remember to throw a ball...

1378
01:17:16,867 --> 01:17:22,874
doesn't mean I should forget
my life or anyone else's.

1379
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,841
Therefore, I'm not going to sign
any letters to any schools.

1380
01:17:27,867 --> 01:17:30,438
Now, that's reality.

1381
01:17:30,467 --> 01:17:32,037
Thank you.

1382
01:17:32,067 --> 01:17:34,707
You listen to me.
You are going to Piermont.

1383
01:17:34,734 --> 01:17:37,180
- No, I'm not.
- If he doesn't go, I don't go.

1384
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,305
- I'm with him.
- Wait a minute, fellas.

1385
01:17:39,334 --> 01:17:40,506
Hold on, fellas.

1386
01:17:40,534 --> 01:17:42,707
Piermont University
will honor all its commitments.

1387
01:17:42,734 --> 01:17:43,940
Now, I promise you that.

1388
01:17:43,967 --> 01:17:46,174
Slight misunderstanding,
ladies and gentlemen.

1389
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,440
Bear with us.

1390
01:17:47,467 --> 01:17:48,468
Who are you?

1391
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,537
My name is Floyd Gondole.

1392
01:17:50,567 --> 01:17:53,571
I am the NCAA recruitment
investigator...

1393
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,908
and I have followed...

1394
01:17:54,934 --> 01:17:58,381
the recruitment of Johnny Walker
since day one...

1395
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:01,609
and I am now calling
for a complete investigation...

1396
01:18:01,634 --> 01:18:04,012
of UCC, OI' TeX...

1397
01:18:04,034 --> 01:18:06,981
and, specifically, Piermont.

1398
01:18:07,001 --> 01:18:08,378
We didn't do anything wrong.

1399
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:11,643
You call framing a kid
for rape not wrong?

1400
01:18:11,667 --> 01:18:13,613
You mean you framed
the kid for rape?

1401
01:18:13,634 --> 01:18:15,580
You're both history.
You're both finished.

1402
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:16,635
Oh, this is ridiculous.

1403
01:18:16,667 --> 01:18:18,510
Congratulations, John.
I'm proud of you.

1404
01:18:18,534 --> 01:18:20,104
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is...

1405
01:18:20,134 --> 01:18:21,807
You did good.
I'm proud of you.

1406
01:18:21,834 --> 01:18:25,247
Hey, Johnny, I'm proud of you.
You did good, kid.

1407
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:27,304
So, what are you going
to do now, huh?

1408
01:18:27,334 --> 01:18:29,780
Penn State, Johnny!
Penn State! Penn State!

1409
01:18:29,801 --> 01:18:32,213
Alabama! Remember the weather!

1410
01:18:32,234 --> 01:18:34,407
Listen, Johnny, nobody--
and I mean nobody--

1411
01:18:34,434 --> 01:18:36,141
makes a schmuck
out of me, capisce?

1412
01:18:36,167 --> 01:18:37,544
Nobody has to, Lew.

1413
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,705
Is that right?

1414
01:18:39,867 --> 01:18:41,471
You're going down now, Lew.

1415
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,502
Oh, you done made
a big mistake.

1416
01:18:47,067 --> 01:18:48,671
No pictures!

1417
01:18:53,834 --> 01:18:56,872
Title fight.
Hey, wish I could help.

1418
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:15,472
Thank you, my friend.

1419
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:17,139
Good move, man.

1420
01:19:18,967 --> 01:19:20,640
Let's get out of here.

1421
01:19:23,801 --> 01:19:25,212
Get back here, Walker!

1422
01:19:25,234 --> 01:19:27,441
Get out of my way!
Walker, get back here!

1423
01:19:30,434 --> 01:19:31,742
Get down, Gramp.

1424
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:33,212
Never did like that fella.

1425
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:49,146
Coach. Coach.

1426
01:20:06,267 --> 01:20:07,337
Coach?

1427
01:20:10,667 --> 01:20:12,169
I want an education.

1428
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:17,278
I saw the news conference
last night, Johnny.

1429
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:19,837
Yeah?

1430
01:20:22,134 --> 01:20:23,977
What'd you think?

1431
01:20:24,001 --> 01:20:26,675
You showed
the type of character...

1432
01:20:26,701 --> 01:20:28,772
that we like in our students.

1433
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,143
I like that.

1434
01:20:31,567 --> 01:20:34,980
Does this mean...

1435
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,002
you want me
to come play ball here?

1436
01:20:40,567 --> 01:20:42,513
You bet I do.

1437
01:21:55,567 --> 01:21:59,913
The Johnny Walker recruitment
scandal widened today...

1438
01:21:59,934 --> 01:22:03,609
with the announcement
that UCC and OI' Tex...

1439
01:22:03,634 --> 01:22:07,207
have each been placed
on one-year probation.

1440
01:22:07,234 --> 01:22:09,236
Well, Joe Bob, thank God...

1441
01:22:09,267 --> 01:22:11,713
basketball season's
right around the corner.

1442
01:22:11,734 --> 01:22:13,839
Yeah, amen to that, Tex.

1443
01:22:13,867 --> 01:22:17,474
You know, football ain't been
good to us this year at all.

1444
01:22:22,967 --> 01:22:25,573
In a still further
development...

1445
01:22:25,601 --> 01:22:30,346
Lew Landers has been barred
from participating...

1446
01:22:30,367 --> 01:22:34,179
in the UCC football program
for life.

1447
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,840
You have one "F"?
We'll take care of it for you.

1448
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:40,341
Hey, slow down for a minute!
I just want to talk to you!

1449
01:22:40,434 --> 01:22:42,710
Lew Landers gave me that jeep!

1450
01:22:55,567 --> 01:22:58,878
This is a pack of lies!
A pack of lies!

1451
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:01,779
I know what I did.

1452
01:23:01,801 --> 01:23:02,779
No, no.

1453
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,711
I hired a common idiot!

1454
01:23:04,734 --> 01:23:06,077
A common idiot!

1455
01:23:06,101 --> 01:23:07,341
Get the hell away from me!
