1
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:06,205
It's an honor to announce
this year's Blossom Queen winner.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,573
The most important crown
that any girl can ever wear.

3
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:16,082
Dylan Schoenfield.

4
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:32,264
<i>Dylan.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>

5
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,095
<i>Dylan.</i>

6
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,726
- Dylan!
- Yes, Principal Guthrie?

7
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,302
The Blossom Queen
campaign application.

8
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,370
- Oh.
- I need your signature.

9
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,004
Oh, thanks.

10
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:59,353
Ahem. Next.

11
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:04,161
This year's going to
be <i>très fantastiquè.</i>

12
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:06,199
- Know why?
- Why?

13
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,666
Because once
I'm crowned Blossom Queen,

14
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:12,170
I will be the most popular girl
at Woodlands Academy ever.

15
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,474
Class is downstairs.

16
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:18,977
Drama Club.
Easy votes, they like my dramatic flair.

17
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:21,581
Oh, the very shirt
I introduced last semester.

18
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:24,241
Followers. Easy votes.

19
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:25,985
Film Club nerds.

20
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,452
- You're like a movie star to them.
- Totes.

21
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,220
Indie rock wannabes.

22
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:34,151
What's with the guitars, people?
This isn't a campfire.

23
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,695
I can't believe you used
to be friends with Amy Loubalu.

24
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,025
Alas, it's true.

25
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,066
Until I traded up to you two.

26
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:42,059
Dylan.

27
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,898
I took your suggestion
and got my hair cut into a bob.

28
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,665
Definitely cuted up.

29
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:50,641
See? People know I care.

30
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,836
Easy vote.

31
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:53,470
But what about Nicole Paterson?

32
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,550
She's major competition.

33
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,015
Lola and Hannah see me
as their leader

34
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,123
and a leader
should never show weakness.

35
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,020
That would be <i>très mauvais.</i>

36
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,751
That's French for "ew."

37
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,555
What and ever.

38
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,666
A good candidate likes competish.

39
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,964
If I ran for Blossom Queen unopposed
and won, boring.

40
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,968
And who has the number one seat
on The Ramp?

41
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,240
Dude, hey.

42
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,437
Oh, look, Asher's holding it for me.

43
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:31,242
Oh. So sweet.

44
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,657
Oh, my.

45
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:39,420
Oh!

46
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,152
You... You geek!

47
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,785
This is designer!

48
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,325
No, it's tuna noodle casserole.

49
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,525
You are so gross.

50
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,702
Gross is just one syllable.

51
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,601
I can't believe that popular people like me
are forced

52
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,971
to share the same air
as nerd herders like you.

53
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:59,341
What?
Forced to share the same air as me?

54
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:03,678
Okay, you wear so much perfume,
you need a gas mask just to survive.

55
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,479
Watch.

56
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,487
Is this yesterday's fettuccine Alfredo

57
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,558
- recycled?
- No paparazzi.

58
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,873
Oh.

59
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,773
So sweet.

60
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,753
Oh, my. Oh!

61
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,482
You... You geek!

62
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,092
This is designer!

63
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,722
No, it's tuna noodle casserole.

64
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,922
You are so gross.

65
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,099
Gross is just one syllable.

66
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,462
Oh!

67
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,362
That's classic.

68
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,501
- Look what you did to my friends.
- But I didn't...

69
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,939
I can't believe that popular people like me
are forced

70
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,841
to share the same air
as nerd herders like you.

71
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,081
- Ugh!
- I prefer the term "film geek."

72
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,912
Ugh!

73
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,452
They must practice that.

74
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,320
<i>Casablanca.</i> Curtiz is the director.

75
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,018
It also stars Ingrid Bergman, Peter Lorre
and Claude Rains.

76
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:23,392
As Bogart's best film? I fully disagree.

77
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,125
<i>The African Queen</i> with Katharine
Hepburn, directed by John Huston.

78
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,894
I mean, it's miraculous.

79
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,525
I mean, it's unbelievable. Hi.

80
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,899
Oh, look. Film Club president
finally decided to show up.

81
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,907
Sorry, guys.
I got stuck in traffic on the diva freeway.

82
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,710
- Where's your lunch?
- Dylan Schoenfield's wearing it.

83
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,407
Yeah, my food went where no mere mortal
has ever gone before.

84
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,110
The Ramp.

85
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,688
You need a passport to go in there.

86
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,990
Passport? You need a robot army.

87
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,258
With level 83 "Dragon Slayer" skills.

88
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,631
Okay, guys, seriously,
it's a whole other alien world.

89
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,067
A mystery species.

90
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:07,902
We'll never fully understand the Populars
and the way their strange vortex works.

91
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:11,644
Okay, what are you inventing now?

92
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,173
Artificial Intelligence chess.

93
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,319
Hey, Amy.

94
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,323
That's a cool guitar case.

95
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,162
Never gonna happen, friend.

96
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:35,528
Thanks for the support, pal.

97
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:36,895
Calculate this, Josh.

98
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,233
You've been crushing on Amy Loubalu
since third grade.

99
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,000
We're juniors.

100
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:44,475
That's approximately 2,268 school days,
minus summer breaks,

101
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:47,012
that you could have asked her out
and haven't.

102
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,945
I'd go out with you.

103
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,551
Guys, I don't have time for dating,
okay?

104
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,813
The Puget Sound Film Festival
is only six weeks away.

105
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:57,789
And he's our school's best shot at total
domination of the city's student film scene.

106
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,189
- You better win.
- No. I gotta win.

107
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:04,856
Okay, first prize is a summer
at a Hollywood film camp in Los Angeles.

108
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:07,194
All right, I wanna make
this groundbreaking documentary

109
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,098
that truly changes the bar.

110
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,671
- You know, a film that establishes me
<i>I love you.</i>

111
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:15,298
As the next cinematic genius.

112
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,669
So, what's the documentary about?

113
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:20,906
No idea.

114
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,046
You have no idea.

115
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:29,153
So wanna go out with me?

116
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,827
- What...?
- No.

117
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,329
Come in.

118
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,628
Mr. F.?

119
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,467
Oh, Josh.

120
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,341
Brought my application.

121
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:52,435
My favorite student and great, great.

122
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,571
I like this.

123
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:59,345
I can't wait to see what my star student
has come up with, huh?

124
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:05,121
It's a documentary about the evolution
of robot voices

125
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,851
in the science-fiction genre?

126
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:11,931
Yeah. You know how no two robots
ever sound the same in any sci-fi movie?

127
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:15,264
You know, you have your,
"I am a robot."

128
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:17,394
Then you have these futuristic, like:

129
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:23,776
Josh, your artistic vision
is robot voices?

130
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:26,546
Yeah. Mr. F., I'm struggling here.

131
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:31,107
I... I've got all these great ideas,
but none of them are good enough.

132
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,553
You really would like to win that trip
to Hollywood film camp, huh?

133
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,415
More than anything.

134
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,461
Then challenge yourself, Josh.

135
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:47,130
Choose a documentary subject matter
where you stretch your limits.

136
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,301
Explore new territory, discover the truth.

137
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:55,671
How about, instead of robots,
a human subject?

138
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,141
A human.

139
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:04,312
Okay, so challenging, truthful,
but human.

140
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,487
- Got it.
- Right.

141
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,885
Now, I will need a real proposal
by tomorrow.

142
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:14,358
Otherwise, I will have to give
our school's slot to another student.

143
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,258
Okay.

144
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:25,266
No, I am not taking a dollar less
than listing price.

145
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:29,103
Well, that's great.
I can have the paperwork sent right over.

146
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,510
Great. Talk to you soon.

147
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,280
Well, sweetie, what do you think?

148
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:38,044
Do we turn this place
into a Sparkles Cupcakes

149
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,618
or Accessories Barn?

150
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:43,485
Dad, anyone who buys their accessories
in a barn is totes <i>tragique.</i>

151
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,058
I vote for cupcakes,
gives it more of a glam factor.

152
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,353
And that is why you're my top advisor.

153
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:56,298
You know what? I am gonna have to head
back to the office for a late meeting.

154
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,701
Whatevs.
Oh, I need to borrow your marketing team.

155
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,231
Marketing team? Why?

156
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,239
Blossom Queen. It's essential.

157
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,207
I need signs, brochures, headshots.

158
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,245
Oh, well, absolutely not.

159
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,211
But Nicole Paterson
has the whole varsity

160
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:11,011
and JV football team
making posters for her campaign.

161
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,746
Yes, and you have ingenuity.

162
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,586
If you wanna win,
you need to do this on your own.

163
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,055
You're a smart girl.

164
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,422
Gotta pull yourself up
by your bootstraps.

165
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,490
Yes, this is Alan.

166
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:27,391
Bootstraps?
What does that even mean?

167
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,526
Um, hello, boots have zippers.

168
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,935
I should know, I tried on 17 pairs
at Shoes Unlimited last week

169
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,237
and none of the 16 pairs I bought
had straps.

170
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,611
Bad reception?

171
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,236
Yeah, I, well...

172
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,773
Dude, seriously, this is not refundable.

173
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:52,756
Tell you what, here's 20 percent off
on your next phone.

174
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,120
Thanks.

175
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,138
It's imported leather.

176
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,475
Imported from where?

177
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,777
Somewhere foreign
with lots of shipping costs, duh?

178
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,749
Yeah, probably Italy, duh?

179
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,282
Bee?

180
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:25,153
Bee. Oh, my gosh, a bee.

181
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,654
Bee. Bee. Oh!

182
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,294
Oh, no. Oh, my God.

183
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,298
Stop. Oh, my gosh.

184
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:35,925
Oh, my.

185
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,539
Oh! Oh, no. Oh, my gosh.

186
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:41,732
My purse.

187
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,605
Help. Somebody help.

188
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,816
Someone turn the fountain off.

189
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,884
Chop-chop.

190
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,825
Help. Help me, my purse. Ah!

191
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,427
It's a Serge Sanchez.

192
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:07,227
Will somebody help me?
Someone turn the fountain off.

193
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:10,496
Mr. Farley said that my movie subject
should be human.

194
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,538
Dylan Schoenfield's human.

195
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,935
Sort of.

196
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,440
She's definitely a challenge.

197
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,044
Big challenge.

198
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,205
Someone turn off the fountain, now.

199
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:23,211
Why aren't they listening to me?

200
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,181
Give me your phone.

201
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,317
- Who are you calling?
- 911.

202
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,622
It's that geek from lunch today.

203
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,589
He's saving your purse.

204
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,318
What?

205
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,128
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

206
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,539
Really?

207
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,517
Oh.

208
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,376
Ugh!

209
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,319
Ew!

210
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,527
What?
- Go, Woodlands.

211
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,700
Vote Paterson.

212
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,608
Imported leather
needs specialty cleaning.

213
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,977
When my cell phone got wet, I...

214
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,376
My Serge Sanchez.

215
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,146
You named your purse?

216
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,617
Not so fast.

217
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:07,914
I have a proposal for you.

218
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:11,718
Whatever it is, the answer is NO,
spells no way.

219
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,290
Can I at least propose
the proposal first?

220
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,257
I want you to star in my movie
for the film festival.

221
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,233
Oh, what? Star?

222
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,930
Uh, what's it...? What's it about?

223
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,131
You. Your life.

224
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,833
You know, what it's like to be popular
and run for Blossom Queen?

225
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:35,609
Nicole Paterson might have buttons
and posters,

226
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,580
but what's that compared to a movie?

227
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,743
Especially if it's about me.

228
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,214
Deal.

229
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,825
Once you lose this.

230
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,584
Deal.

231
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,898
The competition just got serious.

232
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,864
It's always been serious for me.

233
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,837
Thad?

234
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:07,539
Tomorrow. Lunch. The dining hall.
We can start filming my movie then.

235
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:11,112
Actually, it's my movie.

236
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,042
Where are my shoes?

237
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,496
You need some major CPR, Serge.

238
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,978
Marta.

239
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,473
I need help carrying.

240
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,184
Marta?

241
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,458
"Dylan, went to dentist,
dinner's in the fridge.

242
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,697
Love, Marta."

243
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,711
You'll be as good as new, Serge.

244
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,081
"Amy posted a picture of Dylan."

245
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,817
What?

246
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,287
Why'd she do that?

247
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:14,605
My mom took that photo when Amy and I
won the second grade science fair,

248
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,175
back when we were besties.

249
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:35,122
Mom died later that same year.

250
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:09,485
Sometimes I like
to look through her old stuff.

251
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,497
Makes me feel like I'm still with her.

252
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,046
Josh, is that you?

253
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:14,650
No, Mom, it's a burglar who just happens
to have keys to the front door.

254
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:25,067
Hey, Mouse.
Who'd you bark at today, buddy?

255
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,399
Who'd you bark at today?

256
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,132
Who'd you bark at today?

257
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,436
Oh, yes, you're a good boy.

258
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,374
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

259
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,275
Come on. Look at me. Come on.

260
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,006
Come on.

261
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,666
Same to you, I think.

262
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:00,172
Hey, guess what?
I found my new documentary subject.

263
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,433
Dylan Schoenfield.

264
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:03,805
- Oh, that is wonderful, hon.
- Yeah.

265
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,002
- Who is he?
- She, Mom.

266
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:08,472
- Oh.
- One of the most popular girls at school.

267
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,243
I was gonna follow her around,
shoot her Blossom Queen campaign.

268
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,482
I'm thinking a hard-hitting exposè
on popularity.

269
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,116
Huh. Well, that sounds like
an ambitious project.

270
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:20,920
Yeah. Speaking of projects, Mom,
what is that?

271
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:26,024
Sushi-making class.
I am making a spicy dragon roll.

272
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,667
Great.

273
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:30,501
There we go. That's that.

274
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,006
Oh, no, my miso.

275
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,206
Hey, Mom, you just wanna phone in
for pizza instead?

276
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,337
Oh, yes.

277
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,673
So much better.

278
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,486
No. No, no, no. Give me...

279
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,390
Go and get him.

280
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:59,255
Hey. Paul, it's Sandy.

281
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:13,076
Oh, I like this, huh?

282
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,545
An exposé on popularity.

283
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:18,116
Yeah. You told me to challenge myself

284
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,187
and Dylan Schoenfield's proving
to be a big challenge.

285
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,085
Don't forget what else I said.

286
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,692
- Seek out the truth, huh?
- Right.

287
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:30,194
The best documentarians leave
their preconceived notions at the door.

288
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,122
Uh...

289
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,256
Totally, Mr. F., yeah.

290
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,662
Dylan Schoenfield, huh?

291
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:43,140
Popularity could turn out
to be more complicated than you think.

292
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,178
Welcome to the competition, Josh.

293
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:48,076
Hollywood, huh?

294
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:50,183
- Yeah.
- Little bit of the action.

295
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:53,952
I'll see you there.

296
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:57,489
Hey. You ready to start?

297
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,717
- Almost. Hold this.
- Mm.

298
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:02,455
First, some ground rules.

299
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,087
One, we need
to set a strict filming schedule.

300
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:07,029
No hanging around me before or after.

301
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,964
Sure. Like I'd want to.

302
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,797
Two, I need a beauty budget.

303
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,405
So $50 a week should suffice.

304
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:14,734
Beauty budget?

305
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,706
I only get $5 a day for lunch.

306
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,835
Three, no filming from my left side.
Ever.

307
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:21,709
It's my bad side, see?

308
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,150
They're exactly the sa...
Are you always this high-maintenance?

309
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,880
It is not high-maintenance
to want to look nice.

310
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,115
<i>Voila</i>, now I'm done.

311
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,822
Hey, don't you want this?

312
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,828
Oh, you can just set it down at my seat.

313
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:42,630
- The Ramp?
- Duh, where else would we eat lunch?

314
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,421
Dylan?

315
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,997
We're shooting a movie.

316
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:17,069
Excuse me.

317
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:22,734
One small step for geeks.

318
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,003
One giant leap for geek-kind.

319
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:26,203
Not now.

320
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,780
Why so determined
to be Blossom Queen?

321
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,941
Because it's the best way
to ensure lifelong popularity.

322
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,450
Aren't you already popular?

323
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:36,119
Let me ask you this,
does Sunshine Lemonade advertise?

324
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:38,781
Yeah, they have the commercials
with the waterskiing penguins.

325
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:41,789
Oh, I like the penguins.

326
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,064
Sunshine is already number one.
They don't need to advertise.

327
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,065
But they do it to stay number one.
Get it?

328
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,260
- Got it.
- Good.

329
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:53,270
Everyone thinks
it's so easy being the popular girl.

330
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:56,534
- It's so not easy.
- Girls, this is <i>moi's</i> movie.

331
00:22:56,675 --> 00:23:00,544
- If they wanna add something, that's fin...
- But being popular is so not easy.

332
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,012
It's like royalty.
Or being the first lady.

333
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,777
You have to live up
to impossible standards of beauty

334
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,853
and you're expected
to be a good influence.

335
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,922
Like I help out the less fortunate.

336
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,751
Oh, you have a charity.

337
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,757
<i>Absolument,</i> fashion victims.

338
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:24,403
Hannah, the yellow scarf you're wearing
is washing you out.

339
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:27,863
Here.

340
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:29,942
Wear mine instead.

341
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,842
See?
I just sacrificed my own outfit for hers.

342
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,073
But it was worth it.

343
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:38,013
Oh!

344
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,284
Josh.

345
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,850
Sorry.

346
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,390
Oh!

347
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:47,951
Hey.

348
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,791
If you're a ten, you can only date a ten,
like Asher.

349
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,866
- Coming to watch me play volleyball?
- Mm-hm.

350
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,797
Dylan, he's blocking your light.

351
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,904
Why is there a talking nerd here?

352
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,670
Asher, we downloaded this.

353
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:05,539
Josh is making a movie
about me winning Blossom Queen.

354
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:06,941
Play nice?

355
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,279
Does it mess with my volleyball sched?

356
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:14,046
Oh, never. We'll work around it.

357
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,757
Got it. Thank you.

358
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:23,624
So this is what you do after school?

359
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,253
Shopping improves the economy.

360
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,559
Oh, how thoughtful.

361
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,134
I know, right? I care.

362
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:33,865
Right. So in a scientific sense,
how does popularity work?

363
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,634
Are the other Blossom Queen
candidates...?

364
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,174
There are levels of popularity.

365
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,369
Anywhere from
student-council-president popular

366
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,309
to only popular with your parents.

367
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:45,441
Sure, Nicole's cheerleader popular,
but is she Blossom Queen popular?

368
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,712
Doubtful.

369
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,256
So how does one move up
this social scale of popularity?

370
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:53,555
Well, one way
is hoping it'll rub off on you.

371
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,217
Popularity's contagious.

372
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:56,454
What? Like a cold?

373
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,457
Duh.

374
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,122
It's why Hannah and Lola battle
to be my better friend.

375
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,928
Their popularity comes from mine.

376
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:08,172
- Six-point-five percent sales tax on 395...
- Um...

377
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:10,333
Twenty-five sixty-seven.

378
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:17,479
Hate it, have it, have it, have it, have it,
hate it, I'll try some on just for fun.

379
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:18,914
How many shoes do you need?

380
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:21,646
One pair for each day of the year.
Why, how many do you own?

381
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:23,119
You're looking at them.

382
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:27,524
Clearly. Totes <i>tragique.</i>

383
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,495
So how long's this gonna take?

384
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,825
No filming in here.

385
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,972
Hey, here's your chance
to tell me something about Dylan.

386
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:43,267
Oh. Like what?

387
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:45,708
Like does your popularity really come
from hers?

388
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:49,844
We may not be as popular as Dylan,
but we do know some stuff.

389
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:54,352
Like, when Dylan doesn't get her way,
she goes full-on DQM.

390
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:55,749
Drama queen mode.

391
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,517
And Asher only dates Dylan
because she worships him.

392
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,489
And Asher loves being worshipped.

393
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,023
Ta-da!

394
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:05,563
So, what do we think?

395
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:11,866
Guys, French is my trademark, duh?

396
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:16,274
So Populars only hang with Populars?

397
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,070
Cats don't hang with dogs, right?

398
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,473
Really?

399
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:20,874
That's your argument?

400
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:22,311
It's better this way.

401
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:25,680
If everyone stays with their own group,
there's no chance for misunderstandings.

402
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:28,515
Like, what kind of misunderstandings?

403
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:30,020
Take you and me, for instance.

404
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,249
If we mingled outside
of doing my movie together,

405
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:34,553
you might get the wrong idea
and ask me out.

406
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,127
Imagine the horror.

407
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:40,255
- You'd be so embarrassed.
- Ahem.

408
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,560
- Did we get it?
- Yep.

409
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,400
We got it.

410
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,699
Ow!

411
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:52,243
- What are your plans after school?
- Uh, Pilates.

412
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,039
But not on Tuesdays, that's yoga.

413
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,880
After you graduate.

414
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:59,010
Hopes? Dreams?

415
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:00,210
What's your life goal?

416
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:01,581
Blossom Queen.

417
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,122
- After that.
- After?

418
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:08,523
If I don't win Blossom Queen, my
life is officially O-V-E-R, over.

419
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,686
Oh, you missed a spot.

420
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:15,523
I have no words. Nothing.

421
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:18,093
<i>Josh?</i>

422
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:22,064
Snack break? It's satay.

423
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:23,903
It's from my Thai cooking class.

424
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,469
Uh...

425
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,136
It's not good.

426
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:31,740
How's the big movie coming?

427
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,578
<i>Josh.</i>

428
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:34,880
<i>Josh.</i>

429
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,184
<i>Get my shoes. My feet are cold.</i>

430
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,895
Well, she's...

431
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:45,428
- Well, I don't...
<i>- Josh.</i>

432
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:46,862
- Diva?
- Yeah.

433
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:51,664
Yeah. You know, I wanna make this true
documentary about high school popularity,

434
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,499
but, Mom, this is a joke.

435
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:56,473
Well, I mean, sometimes people behave
a certain way

436
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,203
because they have something else
going on.

437
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,676
What's the real Dylan like?

438
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:02,337
Real, Mom?

439
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:05,041
Okay, the only real thing
about Dylan Schoenfield

440
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,812
is that she's really annoying.

441
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,417
You have to give her
the benefit of the doubt.

442
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:13,048
- Mom.
- You have to be an archeologist.

443
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,184
Dig deeper.

444
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,730
Oh!

445
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,901
This is going to look fantastic.

446
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,707
I can't believe we were invited
to a beach party with the Populars.

447
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:37,873
It's strictly work, okay?

448
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:39,243
Heh. Nice bonnet.

449
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,750
Sun is evil.

450
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:43,981
Well, I, for one, plan to have fun.

451
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:45,418
Hey.

452
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,857
Oh, finally.
I see you brought your non-tourage.

453
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,060
This is Ari, my second AD.

454
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,392
He's in charge of all the B-roll.

455
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,530
Whatever all that means.

456
00:28:56,001 --> 00:29:01,338
Okay, well, you know, I'm going
to take some, uh, additional shots.

457
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:07,612
Sorry we were late,
I had to get directions.

458
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,114
Directions? You've never been
to the beach? Everybody likes the beach.

459
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,548
Not me.

460
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,210
Shocker, not everyone's
into the same things you are.

461
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,679
I find that hard to believe.

462
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:19,150
Heh.

463
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:21,025
Come on.

464
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:23,792
Okay.

465
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:36,933
Come on, Eagles. Let's go.

466
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:38,805
Next time, baby. It's okay.

467
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:42,471
We're still two points behind.

468
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:45,975
Go, guys, come on.

469
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:49,145
- Water, babe?
- Yeah.

470
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,017
Excuse me.

471
00:29:55,661 --> 00:30:00,326
Hi. Despite our northern latitude,
the sun still emits dangerous UV rays.

472
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:06,563
It's like sitting in a fryer at Burger
World without the side of onion rings.

473
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,006
SPF 80?

474
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,341
Oh, yeah.

475
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,076
Oh, yeah.

476
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,386
Come here.

477
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,988
Hey, Amy.

478
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,856
Nice, uh, stick thing.

479
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:06,695
Thanks. It's called a Gator Grabber.

480
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:10,497
Gator? Like alligator. Whoa.

481
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:13,127
- Ha, ha.
- That's weird.

482
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,001
- Saving the environment?
- Yeah.

483
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:22,205
Yeah. Go green.

484
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,543
Hey, doing okay.

485
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:27,585
Amy and I
had our first real conversation.

486
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:38,153
Should be called a Croc Catcher

487
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,197
because crocodiles
actually do eat garbage.

488
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,991
- Oh.
- Yeah.

489
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:44,731
Josh.

490
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,203
Josh? Josh?

491
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,370
Josh,
enough with the unscheduled break.

492
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:51,443
It's time to get back to work.

493
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:53,509
Hi to you too, Dylan.

494
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,136
How are you these days?

495
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,840
I'd be better if strangers didn't tag me
in ancient pics online.

496
00:31:57,983 --> 00:31:59,542
- Come on, Josh.
- Strangers?

497
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:02,415
Gee, as I recall it,
we used to be friends.

498
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:05,353
Josh, come on, let's go.
Chop-chop, time is money.

499
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:08,957
Bye, Amy.

500
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,722
Bye, Josh.

501
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,029
Oh, I so saved you back there.

502
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:21,140
You should have been focused
on filming me, instead of flirting.

503
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,400
Flirting?

504
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:24,567
I wasn't... I wa... No, no, no.

505
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,139
I don't flirt.

506
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,975
Oh, clearly. It was totes <i>tragique.</i>

507
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,083
It's more obvious
that you like Amy Loubalu

508
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:33,014
than Nicole Paterson's hair extensions.

509
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,450
Yeah. I mean, no.

510
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:37,655
Wait.

511
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,380
You two used to be friends?

512
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:43,154
Ugh. I know, hard to believe.
Back in elementary school.

513
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,787
Are you getting my good side, right?
Over here.

514
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,661
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm getting it.

515
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,126
So, what happened?

516
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,793
Look at her and look at me.

517
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:54,406
Life happened, I.e. I'm popular.

518
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:55,632
Amy's popular.

519
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:58,174
We've gone over this, Josh.

520
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,279
She's "I'm in a girl band" popular.

521
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:03,280
Not Blossom Queen popular.

522
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,419
Oh, no, the volleyball game's over.
Asher.

523
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:10,750
Ash.

524
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,282
- Hey, where are you guys going?
- The movies. It's dark.

525
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:17,055
And no one steals our snacks.

526
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:24,132
Victory means Pizza Land.

527
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:27,637
Two large Meat Volcanoes,
triple cheese. You ready, Dyl?

528
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,468
Oh, well, Marta made me a pizza
last night,

529
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:32,442
so I called ahead
and got us all reservations

530
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,170
to the new sushi place downtown.

531
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:37,142
Raw fish?

532
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:39,012
Ralph.

533
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:40,510
Have fun with that.

534
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:42,780
- I'm outtie with my boys.
- Yeah.

535
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:44,890
Yeah.

536
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,754
I don't like fish either.

537
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,931
I could eat pizza every day. Heh.

538
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:57,827
Wait.

539
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,267
Wait, wait, no, no, no.

540
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:02,806
Call 911. Call 911.
Someone's stealing my car.

541
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:04,637
What are you doing? Stop, what is this?

542
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:08,338
Six unpaid parking tickets.

543
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,539
Oops.

544
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:11,946
- Seven.
- Ugh.

545
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,882
When? You mean those little flyer thingies
on my windshield?

546
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,683
- They ain't greeting cards, lady.
- Oh, no.

547
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:19,690
Please?

548
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:21,757
Please?

549
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,954
Oh...

550
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:34,499
You surely have a car, right?

551
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,130
Yeah.

552
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:37,634
This is yours?

553
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:39,745
And it runs? On real gas?

554
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,403
So she's a little old.

555
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:45,813
Old? This thing is, like, prehistoric.

556
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:50,782
You know, somewhere a caveman
is missing his car.

557
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,420
Hello?

558
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,195
Thank you.

559
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:05,568
Why are you hiding?

560
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:07,404
It's called shame.

561
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,075
Well, they're gone now.

562
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,814
Okay, turning on the radio
isn't gonna help our battery situation.

563
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,944
News? Gross.

564
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:24,317
What, the news bores you?

565
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,321
Ever heard of pop music?
We're young, live a little.

566
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,962
- Uh-oh.
- What "oh"?

567
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,127
What's that?

568
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,795
Josh, that never happens to my car.

569
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:43,238
What is that? That's smoke.

570
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:46,340
How are you gonna fix it?

571
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,177
We're gonna need to find a gas station.

572
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,514
- We?
- Fine.

573
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:56,781
Stay here.

574
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:03,858
There is no way I am risking
being seen hanging out in this thing.

575
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:07,096
Josh.

576
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,130
Ugh. Stupid phone.

577
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,327
Who are you so busy texting?

578
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,528
The girls.

579
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:16,164
Telling them that this is the W-O-R-S-T,
worst day of my life.

580
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:17,969
Yeah? Ditto.

581
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,237
Ow! Oh! Ow, ow, ow.

582
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,546
My ankle. I think it's broken.

583
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:23,842
You probably just twisted it.

584
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:26,315
Well, I can't walk, it could swell up.

585
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:30,578
You know, this is all your fault.

586
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:33,157
If you didn't have a junker car,
this never would've happened.

587
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:36,022
Sorry we don't all have nice BMW's.

588
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:39,222
Which you'd be driving right now
if you weren't such a diva.

589
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,855
- What did you call me?
- Nothing.

590
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:42,331
You said something. I heard.

591
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:44,095
- Fine.
- Ow.

592
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,494
Diva. I called you a diva.

593
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:49,472
Precious cargo here, buddy. And don't
ever call me that word ever again.

594
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:52,805
What? Diva? D-I-V-A, what's that spell?

595
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,572
Oh, that's right, diva.

596
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,478
Diva? I'm a movie star.
You said so yourself.

597
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,084
No, what you are is a selfish whiner.

598
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,153
I'm talented. Take that back or I'll...

599
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:04,756
- Or what?
- I'll fire you from my movie.

600
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,915
It's my movie. I'm the director.

601
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,653
If anyone's fired, it's you, you diva.

602
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:12,394
- Ew. You're fired.
- No, you're fired.

603
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,828
Wait. Where are you going?

604
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,331
I always get the last word.

605
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:17,197
Nope, not today.

606
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,668
But how am I gonna get home?

607
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,305
Uh, there's this thing called the bus.

608
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,772
Enjoy the ride.

609
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,308
Bus?

610
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:29,910
I got rid of the drama queen.

611
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:34,110
I'm sure it's not too late
to change documentary subjects.

612
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,479
Right?

613
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:39,887
I'm afraid it's too late for you
to change your documentary subject.

614
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:44,052
- You'll never get a new film done in time.
- Yeah.

615
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,463
You're not a quitter, Josh.
What happened?

616
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,957
It's Dylan Schoenfield, all right?

617
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,126
She's too much of a challenge.

618
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:55,231
Sometimes the truth isn't easy.

619
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:59,974
It's a shame to think Woodlands
won't even have an official entry

620
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,739
in the film festival this year.

621
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,779
Now, will it?

622
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:07,818
Okay, you can do this.

623
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,215
- Knock them dead.
- Thanks.

624
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:18,089
Thank you. Thank you, everybody,
and hello, fellow Woodlanders.

625
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:21,131
Dylan Schoenfield here,
like you don't know.

626
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:23,861
Anyway,
vote for me for Blossom Queen

627
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:29,134
because this school deserves to be ruled
by something sweet.

628
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,776
Whoo! Who wants candy?

629
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,238
Everybody loves chocolate, right?

630
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:37,315
It's sweet and it's me.

631
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,974
Everyone gets their turn.

632
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:44,990
Hi, everyone, it's me, Nicole Paterson,
your next Blossom Queen.

633
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:50,692
Ready, okay.

634
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:52,463
N stands for nice.

635
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,198
I stands for integrity.

636
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:55,957
C stands for cool.

637
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,659
O stands for original.

638
00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:59,528
L stands for loyal.

639
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,470
And E stands
for extremely delicious cupcakes.

640
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,607
Go, Woodlands.

641
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,882
Vote Paterson. Ha-ha-ha.

642
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:22,056
Whoo! Cupcakes for everyone.

643
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:24,288
Come get your cupcakes.

644
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:26,261
Oh, no, she did not.

645
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,093
Oh, yes, she did.

646
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:30,259
- Can we get a cupcake too?
- Oh, vote for Paterson.

647
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,733
Vote for Paterson.

648
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,395
Dylan.

649
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:37,976
Ian Green complimented my new haircut
and then he asked me to spring formal.

650
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,168
Awesome, right?

651
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,608
Oh, Olivia, that's great.

652
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:41,974
So I can count on your vote?

653
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:44,913
Uh...

654
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:50,817
What and ever, Dyl.

655
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,150
Cupcakes are lame.

656
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,849
You have a movie
being made about you.

657
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:55,893
Yeah, you're gonna be a star.

658
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:59,520
Yeah, like Nicole Paterson
can compete with that?

659
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:10,332
The soldiers of ancient Greece
fought in a phalanx.

660
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:11,738
Latin for finger.

661
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:17,114
A phalanx
is a rectangular mass military formation,

662
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:22,380
usually composed entirely
of heavy infantry.

663
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,045
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we get it.

664
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,783
The Spartan hoplites combined
with the narrow space of Thermopylae

665
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,985
made for
a seriously not-glamorous battle.

666
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:30,561
But I've got my own battles.

667
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:33,290
I'll never win Blossom Queen
without my movie.

668
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,300
The persuasive qualities of the phalanx

669
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,997
were its relative simplicity and low cost,

670
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:44,109
as well as being a source
of political influence.

671
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:49,539
As well, sometimes when the phalanxes
were pushed at top speed,

672
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:50,808
they would ram.

673
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:54,477
Thus we learn
the term Greece Lightning.

674
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,049
Heh.

675
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:15,300
Bela Lugosi, Frank Langella,
Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken...

676
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,342
Christopher Walken. He played the
Headless Horseman in <i>Sleepy Hollow.</i>

677
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,570
- He would never be Dracula.
- Christopher Walken.

678
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:22,180
You know, I'm gonna suck your blood.

679
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:25,215
Gonna do it. Gonna bite your neck,
it's gonna hurt. Put a Band-Aid on.

680
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,945
Just don't stab me in the heart,
it's rude. Blah. Blah, blah...

681
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,480
Steven.

682
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:34,321
I'm with them.

683
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:38,787
Hey, can I cutsies in line with you?

684
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,057
What are you doing here?

685
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:43,691
I'm here to see <i>Flight
of the Navigator.</i>

686
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:45,161
Duh.

687
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,334
Wait, you're into sci-fi?

688
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,171
Who doesn't like science?

689
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:51,139
And fiction? Together?

690
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:54,507
Wow, it's like skinny jeans
and ballet flats. Heh.

691
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:00,851
Speaking of, I'm liking the new look.

692
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,046
Oh, move up.

693
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:15,533
Thanks.

694
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,025
Um, what's Dylan doing here?

695
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:19,933
I'm supposed to be the only girl.

696
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:23,303
The Film Society has an open policy.
Right?

697
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:25,774
Right. It's in our bylaws.

698
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:29,870
You know, we don't wanna
be exclusionary, like the Populars.

699
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:31,845
So, what are we talking about?

700
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:34,179
Not you. I mean...

701
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,451
The movie. What else?

702
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:39,318
I question the notion
that the protagonist didn't age.

703
00:42:39,457 --> 00:42:42,359
There is no plot if he did grow older.
It's called a movie.

704
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,621
They didn't explain
that in the exposition, did they?

705
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,788
- Where's your suspension of disbelief?
- You know...

706
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:48,763
You wanna halfsies, Caitlin?

707
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:50,931
Anything to add, Dylan?

708
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:55,230
It's called time dilation, people.

709
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:57,239
As Einstein theorized
in the twin paradox,

710
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,708
the passage of time
is linked to the speed of the observer,

711
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:03,110
that traveling to and from the planet
Phaelon 250 times the speed of light

712
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,046
would virtually suspend aging, duh?

713
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,815
So I've discovered
that there is such a thing as a bus.

714
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:16,325
I've been taking it everywhere lately,
it's green.

715
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:20,226
Okay, so my dad grounded
the Dylish-mobile

716
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:22,663
until I can pay off my parking tickets.

717
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,429
It's all good, I'm parked down here.

718
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,896
So, what's with the secret smarts?

719
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:29,473
Exactly. They're secret.

720
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,473
Now, let's keep it that way.

721
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,704
Yeah, heaven forbid anyone thought
you had a brain

722
00:43:34,846 --> 00:43:36,314
in that pretty little head of yours.

723
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,678
Only nerds get A's.

724
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:39,909
You think I'm pretty?

725
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:41,883
Sure. Doesn't everyone?

726
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:48,558
Okay, so look, I was thinking
I could nicely un-fire you from my movie.

727
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:54,325
Really? You mean,
I could nicely re-hire you for my movie?

728
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:57,896
Word on the street is that you had
to drop out of the film festival

729
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:59,970
because you don't have a film anymore.

730
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:03,131
I'm guessing you wanna win that just
as bad as I wanna win Blossom Queen?

731
00:44:03,608 --> 00:44:06,737
Fair enough. But under one condition.

732
00:44:07,712 --> 00:44:09,146
No more diva.

733
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,680
What? I was never a diva.

734
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:14,482
Bus stop is that way.

735
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:19,590
Fine. Deal,

736
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:21,016
part two.

737
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:23,461
Deal, part two.

738
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:27,263
So is your car gonna start
this time or...?

739
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:29,498
The fun is in the mystery.

740
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:31,694
Come on.

741
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,532
Okay.

742
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,374
Home sweet...

743
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,309
Wow.

744
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,820
It's big.

745
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:53,020
Real inviting, right?

746
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:54,623
Is your dad at work?

747
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:55,954
Yeah.

748
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:57,561
Where's your mom?

749
00:44:58,563 --> 00:45:00,691
She passed away.

750
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,262
I was 8.

751
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:06,501
I had no...

752
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:09,865
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

753
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:14,338
So you wanna come in? Hang for a bit?

754
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:16,071
Sure.

755
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,519
Okay, so, what does your dad do?

756
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:24,019
Oh, he owns a bunch of real estate
around town.

757
00:45:24,155 --> 00:45:27,523
So he's either always working
or hanging with his girlfriend.

758
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:30,651
Yeah. My dad lives in San Diego.

759
00:45:30,795 --> 00:45:33,162
Guess we both only have one parent.

760
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:35,596
Come on,
I wanna show you something.

761
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:40,670
What I'm about to share with you
is a highly top-secret recipe.

762
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:43,741
The everything-but-the-kitchen-sink
sundae.

763
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:45,399
Yeah, I've never heard of that before.

764
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:47,671
Duh, what do you think "top secret"
means?

765
00:45:47,812 --> 00:45:53,046
And that secret is you find every sugary,
gooey substance

766
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:56,882
you could possibly find in the kitchen
and mix it all together.

767
00:45:57,021 --> 00:45:58,751
What are we waiting for?

768
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:03,520
Welcome to the
everything-but-the-kitchen-sink sundae.

769
00:46:03,661 --> 00:46:07,063
You wanna get your ice cream in there.
You want a variety of ice cream.

770
00:46:07,198 --> 00:46:08,632
You think that's enough ice cream?

771
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:09,859
Gummy bears.

772
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:11,765
I love gummy bears.
You want a gummy bear?

773
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:12,961
Sprinkles.

774
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:14,629
Ooh.

775
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:17,001
Worms.

776
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:18,734
Gross.

777
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,338
Ooh.

778
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:23,807
Gummy bears
and chocolate chips together?

779
00:46:27,652 --> 00:46:29,314
What you gonna do?

780
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,944
What you gonna do about it?

781
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:32,249
What you gonna do about that?

782
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:33,449
Oh-ho-ho.

783
00:46:33,591 --> 00:46:35,253
Dylish.

784
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:38,453
So, what's the 411 on your Amy crush?

785
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:40,998
Although I don't know
why you're crushing on her.

786
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:42,562
Where's the peanut butter?

787
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,669
You know,
I didn't even think that nerds dated.

788
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:48,171
Geeks.
Okay, and we are people too, Dylan.

789
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:52,103
Since we're talking
about personal 411s,

790
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:53,472
what's with you and Asher?

791
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:57,048
- What about us?
- Well, he's kind of an idiot.

792
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:59,741
Gee, I don't remember asking you
your opinion.

793
00:46:59,884 --> 00:47:01,216
Hey, you started it.

794
00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:03,321
Talking about me and my "love life."

795
00:47:03,788 --> 00:47:07,919
Exactly. "Love life" implies you're dating,
which you are not.

796
00:47:09,093 --> 00:47:10,652
I know what my movie needs.
A makeover.

797
00:47:10,795 --> 00:47:12,696
No, please, no more shopping footage.

798
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,488
Not for me, for you.

799
00:47:14,632 --> 00:47:16,692
Here, I can get some before footage
of my work.

800
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,167
I'm not one
of your fashion victim charities.

801
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:22,205
Okay, Dyl? I like the way I am.

802
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,138
You would.

803
00:47:25,743 --> 00:47:27,473
More whipped cream?

804
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,599
Snoop much?

805
00:47:51,102 --> 00:47:53,071
Is this your mom?

806
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:58,841
Yeah. She met my dad
at the Woodlands Spring Formal.

807
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:01,002
Crazy, huh?

808
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,746
Wait. Was your mom Blossom Queen?

809
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:07,709
Back in the olden days.

810
00:48:07,852 --> 00:48:09,650
1985.

811
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:11,522
Wow.

812
00:48:11,756 --> 00:48:12,849
I bet you miss her.

813
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:16,422
Lots.

814
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:20,023
This house gets kind of lonely
with just me and my dad.

815
00:48:21,766 --> 00:48:27,069
So when you said there's nothing more
to life than winning Blossom Queen...

816
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:32,775
Yeah, because of my mom.

817
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:37,345
If I win, it's like we're still connected.

818
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:40,478
Like she's still with me.

819
00:48:42,553 --> 00:48:44,920
You know what, I'll do it.

820
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:47,583
I'll do the makeover.

821
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:49,956
- Really?
- Yeah.

822
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:55,261
Let's start with this.
I'm getting so excited.

823
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,268
Knees higher. Chin up.

824
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:36,806
Make sure your elbows move
with the rope.

825
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:38,773
That's pretty good.

826
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:41,344
Okay, let's go, let's go, come on.

827
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,738
I'm not used to sweating.

828
00:49:43,881 --> 00:49:46,248
Yeah, it shows,
but girls like a sporty guy.

829
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:50,883
I don't think jump roping
is my thing. Ugh.

830
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,954
Up. Up.

831
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:57,486
Oh, Serge Sanchez's new cologne,
Man Power.

832
00:49:57,628 --> 00:49:59,756
Man Power?

833
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:15,806
Turn him around, I wanna see the front.

834
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:22,548
Hey, turn it off,
I'm the only documentarian here.

835
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,948
Now show him.

836
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:27,585
Ridiculous.

837
00:50:27,725 --> 00:50:29,023
Wait, is that a compliment?

838
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:31,219
Josh, upload on the lingo already?

839
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,392
- Thank you, it looks fantastic.
- Mm-hm.

840
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:36,626
Now, go see the finished look.

841
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:38,531
Oh, wait.

842
00:50:48,846 --> 00:50:53,250
See? It's not so high-maintenance
to wanna look nice.

843
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:56,044
And now, for the finishing touch.

844
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:57,745
What?

845
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:01,325
A second pair of shoes,
since I ruined the first. Heh.

846
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,222
Really?

847
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:07,097
Awesome. Thank you, Dylan.

848
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:12,231
We'll tell my dad it's beauty budget
for the movie.

849
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,564
My mom.

850
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:20,041
She wants me to pick up naan bread
on my way home.

851
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:22,169
I love Indian food.

852
00:51:22,313 --> 00:51:25,078
I have to go to dinner with my dad
and his stupid girlfriend.

853
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:26,274
Thanks.

854
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,886
Well, you can come over if you want.

855
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:30,744
Oh, no, you don't have to.

856
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:33,414
I know, but you're welcome to.

857
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:38,085
Okay, what's the hold up?

858
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:40,791
Thank you.

859
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,333
- After you.
- Oh, thank you.

860
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,904
So, this is it, home, sweet home.

861
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:50,371
Hey, you get to meet Mouse today.

862
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:52,066
Who's Mouse?

863
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:54,970
Oh, hey, buddy.

864
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:06,587
Oh, Josh, new hair...
Oh, my gosh, a girl.

865
00:52:07,725 --> 00:52:10,058
- Hi.
- Hi.

866
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,590
- The first Josh has brought home.
- Mom.

867
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:15,825
- Oh, I need to get my camera.
- No, you don't.

868
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:19,260
I bring girls home. Tons.

869
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:21,268
Oh.

870
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:23,474
- Oh, wait, you're...
- Dylan Schoenfield.

871
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:25,098
Oh.

872
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,044
- Hi. Ha, ha.
- Hi.

873
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:31,573
Oh, my samosas.

874
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:33,650
Hey, Mom, I'm gonna go give Dylan
the tour.

875
00:52:33,784 --> 00:52:35,309
Okay.

876
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:37,045
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

877
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:38,519
Okay.

878
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:40,284
Mom.

879
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,693
Delish.
This is the best Indian food ever.

880
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,459
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

881
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:49,032
Thank you.

882
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,498
Way to play my mom, Dyl.

883
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:53,962
Oh. No, not at all. These samosas
are <i>très bons</i>, Mrs. Rosen.

884
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:56,005
Oh, please, it's Sandy.

885
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,132
I stopped being Mrs. Rosen
two years ago.

886
00:53:00,144 --> 00:53:03,512
- So are you two dating now?
- Ahem.

887
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:05,946
- Uh, no. I didn't te...
- I'll help.

888
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:09,218
Josh, will you take out the garbage?

889
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:10,719
Yeah.

890
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,860
- Josh and I are just friends, Sandy.
- Oh.

891
00:53:18,996 --> 00:53:21,158
I thought maybe
because he brought you here to meet me,

892
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,995
I thought maybe something else
was going on.

893
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:26,035
No, I already have a boyfriend.

894
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:29,065
And Josh likes someone else,
so I don't know.

895
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,232
Don't get me wrong, though,
Josh is totes awesome.

896
00:53:32,009 --> 00:53:33,068
Well, I think so too.

897
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:35,643
Mouse. Chow time.

898
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:43,379
Were you spying on us?

899
00:53:43,754 --> 00:53:45,017
What? No.

900
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:47,852
Girl talk? Gross.
Give me the towel, I'll dry.

901
00:53:50,194 --> 00:53:52,095
What do you think about that?
Is that gross?

902
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,161
Oh, my gosh. Don't do that.

903
00:53:55,299 --> 00:53:57,234
No.

904
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,234
Don't do that.

905
00:54:01,505 --> 00:54:04,737
Don't do that.
These are designer! Stop it.

906
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,674
No.

907
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:17,313
Of course boring old walking
would turn out to be your thing.

908
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:20,447
What? It's green to walk to school.

909
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:26,096
You sure this isn't too much?

910
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:28,490
Huh?

911
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:30,066
- It means good.
- Okay.

912
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,669
Oh, wait.

913
00:54:37,808 --> 00:54:40,300
- Now, go.
- Okay.

914
00:54:44,248 --> 00:54:46,410
You know what? I took that last semester.

915
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,356
- Hey, Josh.
- Hey.

916
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:05,663
New clothes?
- Yeah, I, uh, did my laundry.

917
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,298
Doing laundry's a good look for you.

918
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,613
Josh, right?

919
00:55:16,747 --> 00:55:18,716
Digging the vibe.

920
00:55:20,284 --> 00:55:21,809
Hey, Josh.

921
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:24,183
See you in AP English.

922
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:25,889
What?

923
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,506
So...

924
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:49,977
It's kind of nice having girls talk
to me for something

925
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:52,639
other than help on their homework.

926
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:53,910
Yeah.

927
00:55:54,051 --> 00:55:55,383
Wonton Wednesdays.

928
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,215
The mathlete scavenger hunt
is on Saturday.

929
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,220
Outstanding, I'm in. Josh?

930
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,724
Um, Josh, nice haircut.

931
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,989
That's it. Josh, you've been more MIA
than the final digit of pi.

932
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:08,155
Then you show up with a fake-over.
What's going on?

933
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:11,835
Relax, guys. It's just a new haircut
and some new shoes.

934
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:13,562
Dylan thought it would be fun
for the documentary.

935
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,203
When did the documentary get fun?

936
00:56:15,339 --> 00:56:18,207
Isn't it supposed to be
a hard-hitting exposé on the Populars?

937
00:56:18,342 --> 00:56:21,676
It will be. It's just Dylan turned out
to be more interesting than I thought.

938
00:56:21,812 --> 00:56:23,110
Losing focus, my friend.

939
00:56:23,247 --> 00:56:25,409
- First Amy Loubalu and now Dylan.
- What do you mean?

940
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:28,883
Girls you have crushes on,
who are never, ever gonna date you.

941
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:31,045
Okay, I don't have a crush on Dylan.

942
00:56:31,455 --> 00:56:33,424
Please. What and ever.

943
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,253
Josh, what are you doing?

944
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,951
Come on.

945
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:41,690
We're on for Saturday, okay?
It's gonna be ridiculous.

946
00:56:41,832 --> 00:56:43,232
Lates.

947
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:45,899
Ridiculous?

948
00:56:46,036 --> 00:56:47,368
Lates?

949
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:49,132
It's like
<i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers.</i>

950
00:56:49,273 --> 00:56:50,764
Directed by Philip Kaufman.

951
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:55,039
Looks like Josh, but it acts like
it's morphed into a Popular.

952
00:56:57,814 --> 00:57:00,943
- Wow, Josh. You look...
- Adorkable.

953
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,950
My handiwork, <i>naturellement.</i>

954
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:05,048
Amy's sitting over there.

955
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:08,054
And if you're so determined
to ask her out, you better do it now.

956
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:10,888
- I'll save you a seat.
- Yeah?

957
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:13,129
- Okay.
- Go.

958
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,731
Here.

959
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:18,693
So this is what you did all weekend
without us?

960
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:20,133
Josh's makeover?

961
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,603
No, we were filming too, but whatevs.

962
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:24,537
You can make him over all you want.

963
00:57:24,675 --> 00:57:26,143
But he's still Count Dorkula.

964
00:57:27,077 --> 00:57:29,205
We're just saying.
You better watch it or...

965
00:57:29,346 --> 00:57:32,145
- Or what?
- Just or.

966
00:57:34,518 --> 00:57:37,317
Okay, look. Josh is strictly a brofriend.

967
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:40,648
I figured if he's gonna hang around us,
then he might as well look the part.

968
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:42,992
Thanks.

969
00:57:44,161 --> 00:57:46,323
When's this stupid dorkumentary over
anyway?

970
00:57:47,698 --> 00:57:49,030
You missed my game.

971
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:50,429
I had to get my own water.

972
00:57:51,435 --> 00:57:53,267
Spring Formal is two weeks away.

973
00:57:53,537 --> 00:57:56,632
And once I'm Blossom Queen,
everything will go back to the way it was.

974
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:58,503
Swears.

975
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:28,832
My band, Blue Tangerine,
is playing a free show.

976
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:30,598
Bring a friend?

977
00:58:30,741 --> 00:58:32,869
Actually, I was gonna ask you.

978
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:35,040
Ask me to go to my own show?

979
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,841
No, I was gonna ask you on a date.

980
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,374
Really?

981
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,284
How's Saturday? It's my day off.

982
00:58:49,426 --> 00:58:51,725
- Sounds great.
- Great.

983
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:53,125
Cool.

984
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:07,241
Josh Rosen.

985
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,277
I'm Alan Schoenfield.
I just wanted to meet the young man

986
00:59:12,416 --> 00:59:14,749
my daughter's been spending
all of her time with.

987
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:20,381
Oh, and I've never really approved
of that Asher kid, I mean, "Asher"?

988
00:59:20,524 --> 00:59:21,924
What kind of a name is Asher?

989
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:26,323
- Actually, sir, Dylan and Asher are still...
- I like that you have a job.

990
00:59:26,463 --> 00:59:28,091
In my mall.

991
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,097
What time do you get off work?

992
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:33,670
Considering it is your mall, sir,
whenever you say.

993
00:59:33,804 --> 00:59:35,272
- You have dinner plans?
- No, sir.

994
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,370
You do now.

995
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:44,109
Okay.

996
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,810
- Thanks for the ride.
- No prob.

997
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:53,720
That outfit is gonna look so cute,
I'm so totally jealous.

998
00:59:53,857 --> 00:59:54,950
Oh, thanks.

999
00:59:56,293 --> 00:59:57,625
Bye.

1000
01:00:07,471 --> 01:00:08,905
What?

1001
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:13,809
But I can't believe
I've never seen this before.

1002
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:15,936
No? It's a classic.

1003
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:19,538
Now, what's with the rings of fire?

1004
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:23,712
They were created
by using two circular neon tubes.

1005
01:00:23,854 --> 01:00:26,824
And they were moved up and down
using elevator mechanics.

1006
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:30,121
Fritz Lang was most interested
in exploring the intersection

1007
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,491
between magic and technology.

1008
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,064
- Should I be taking notes?
- Yes. Yeah.

1009
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:36,962
It's like I entered an alternate universe.

1010
01:00:37,334 --> 01:00:40,327
Oh, no, wait, worse,
an alternative alternate universe.

1011
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,462
Hey there, pumpkin.

1012
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:45,872
Since you missed dinner with Amber
and me the other night,

1013
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:48,501
I figured it was time
to meet this new boyfriend of yours.

1014
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,171
- Oh, and we got you turkey chowder.
- Dad.

1015
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:54,284
- What? It's your favorite.
- Josh is not my boyfriend, <i>d'accord?</i>

1016
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:55,851
I tried to tell him that, Dyl.

1017
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:57,750
What is it with parents?

1018
01:00:57,888 --> 01:00:59,914
We're just friends,
he's making my movie.

1019
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:01,752
My movie.

1020
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:05,056
And actually, sir, your daughter
helped me land a date for this Saturday.

1021
01:01:05,195 --> 01:01:06,254
Oh, really?

1022
01:01:09,566 --> 01:01:12,035
- Gross, Dad.
- What, that was barely a burp.

1023
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:14,536
Oh, yeah? Was that a challenge?

1024
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,333
All right.

1025
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:28,018
- Men, so juvenile.
- Oh, you're just jealous.

1026
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:29,881
- Of what?
- Because you can't let loose.

1027
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,012
Oh, I've actually heard Dylan burp a lot.

1028
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:33,817
Dad. Mute button, please.

1029
01:01:33,957 --> 01:01:36,222
In fact, she used to like
to try to out-burp me

1030
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,157
- so we'd have these contests. Uh-huh.
- No way.

1031
01:01:38,295 --> 01:01:39,354
That's classic.

1032
01:01:39,496 --> 01:01:40,828
I cannot believe you, Dad.

1033
01:01:40,964 --> 01:01:43,058
Yeah, I can barely believe it myself.

1034
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,862
Really? Okay, fine.

1035
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:47,027
You both wanna hear
what a burp really sounds like?

1036
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:49,230
- Please.
- Okay.

1037
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,468
Here we go.

1038
01:02:04,588 --> 01:02:08,889
- Ah, bravo.
- Oh, the master has spoken.

1039
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:11,517
Thank you, thank you,
I'll be here all week.

1040
01:02:15,165 --> 01:02:17,657
So your dad was really cool.

1041
01:02:17,801 --> 01:02:19,429
I knew you two would get along.

1042
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:22,505
You both like
those old black-and-white movies.

1043
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:23,868
Classics.

1044
01:02:24,007 --> 01:02:27,375
I can't believe he gave me the keys back
to my Dylish-mobile.

1045
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,672
Maybe he should think
you're my boyfriend more often.

1046
01:02:29,813 --> 01:02:31,372
Ha, ha. Maybe he should.

1047
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:40,215
So you're, like, totally erasing
that footage of me burping tonight.

1048
01:02:40,457 --> 01:02:42,358
Why? It's the real you.

1049
01:02:42,659 --> 01:02:43,854
Real is overrated.

1050
01:02:44,394 --> 01:02:46,863
I think I like the real Dylan
more than the cover story.

1051
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:50,533
What and ever. Heh.

1052
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:53,227
So Amy.

1053
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:54,895
Where are you taking her
this weekend?

1054
01:02:55,472 --> 01:02:58,101
Uh, I haven't really thought about it yet.

1055
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,669
Do I have to do everything myself?

1056
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:03,712
Okay, so Asher's having a party
this weekend.

1057
01:03:03,847 --> 01:03:05,941
I can get you on the invite list. Done.

1058
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:09,379
I'm not sure that's my thing.

1059
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:12,580
- I know what girls like, remember?
- Yeah.

1060
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:16,021
- Bye.
- Later.

1061
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,427
Some great stuff here, Josh.

1062
01:03:22,499 --> 01:03:23,865
How's editing?

1063
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,969
Uh, I've just been crammed lately.

1064
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:28,128
Between shopping with Dylan
on Saturday

1065
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:31,173
and she came over to my place
for dinner the other night.

1066
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:33,834
It's... Yeah, I'll get to it, okay?
I swear.

1067
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:38,415
Right, well, the film festival board needs
to approve the rough cut

1068
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:40,244
two days before the festival.

1069
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:43,353
I'm on top of it, Mr. F.
All right, I know what movie I wanna make.

1070
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,212
Good.

1071
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:47,181
Yeah.

1072
01:03:57,734 --> 01:03:59,168
Hi.

1073
01:04:00,537 --> 01:04:02,472
- Oh, here, listen to this.
- Okay.

1074
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:05,336
- It's Blue Tangerine's new demo.
- Okay.

1075
01:04:10,113 --> 01:04:11,843
- It's not for everyone.
- No.

1076
01:04:12,082 --> 01:04:14,347
I could get used to it.

1077
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,123
So...

1078
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:26,360
- Shall we go?
- Oh.

1079
01:04:26,496 --> 01:04:28,692
Of course, yes. Right, sorry.

1080
01:04:28,832 --> 01:04:30,391
After you.

1081
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:36,567
So, what's the plan for today?

1082
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:40,575
I was thinking if it's not too much
to ask on the first date,

1083
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,077
- take you home, meet my mom?
- Oh.

1084
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:45,341
She's taking Greek cooking classes.

1085
01:04:45,482 --> 01:04:47,280
She's making lamb kabobs for lunch.

1086
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:50,444
And I'm sure they're delish.
It's just that I'm a vegetarian.

1087
01:04:50,587 --> 01:04:51,919
- Right.
- I'm sorry.

1088
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:53,751
No, it's okay.

1089
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,325
Except when you're craving a burger.
Ha-ha-ha.

1090
01:04:56,793 --> 01:04:58,921
- How about a movie?
- Two hours in the dark?

1091
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:00,621
On a day like this?

1092
01:05:00,764 --> 01:05:03,757
Okay, how about a party?

1093
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,232
At Asher Dumetz's place?

1094
01:05:06,336 --> 01:05:09,966
- You're friends with the volleyball dudes?
- No. Not at all.

1095
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:11,938
I'm glad we cleared that up because...

1096
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:14,169
I don't know, I don't usually roll
with that crowd.

1097
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,505
Perfect.

1098
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:16,908
But should be fun for a laugh.

1099
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:18,412
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1100
01:05:18,548 --> 01:05:19,777
All right.

1101
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:24,313
One second.

1102
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:28,717
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1103
01:05:29,793 --> 01:05:31,056
Really?

1104
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:47,236
Oh, wow.

1105
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:52,141
Whoo!

1106
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:02,786
Here we go.

1107
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:14,999
I'm coming.

1108
01:06:20,844 --> 01:06:23,211
Wanna dance? Wanna dance?

1109
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:25,338
- What?
- Wanna dance?

1110
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:28,179
I'm busy. Maybe later.

1111
01:06:34,524 --> 01:06:35,617
You're late.

1112
01:06:35,859 --> 01:06:37,418
Wait, you invited us?

1113
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:40,587
Ugh. Oh, I knew Josh would have
nowhere hip to take you, so, yes.

1114
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:41,993
You can hang with Asher and me.

1115
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:44,863
I think I'd rather dance.

1116
01:06:57,881 --> 01:06:59,782
Dancing isn't really my thing.

1117
01:07:00,283 --> 01:07:02,445
Just go.

1118
01:07:24,941 --> 01:07:26,739
Show-off.

1119
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,367
I'm happy to see Josh,

1120
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:33,176
but I kind of wish he was on his own
so we could hang out more.

1121
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:34,879
Weird, right?

1122
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:42,157
Okay, I'll stop torturing you.

1123
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:47,595
We got dates to the Spring Formal.

1124
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:48,857
With the twins.

1125
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:50,796
They're matching. I'm with Jay.

1126
01:07:50,934 --> 01:07:52,562
And I'm with Danny.

1127
01:07:54,671 --> 01:07:57,334
<i>Excellent</i>, ladies.
We can triple date, with Asher and me.

1128
01:07:57,473 --> 01:07:59,465
Anyone thirsty?

1129
01:08:08,851 --> 01:08:09,944
What are you looking for?

1130
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:13,451
- Lemonade.
- Oops.

1131
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,558
Took the last one.

1132
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:18,919
Get used to that loser feeling.

1133
01:08:23,733 --> 01:08:24,928
So I was doing my guitar solo

1134
01:08:25,068 --> 01:08:27,469
and then an elephant joined in
on the drums.

1135
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:30,464
Wow, that's awesome.

1136
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,102
Go check on her.

1137
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:35,338
Wait, what?

1138
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:37,447
Sorry, it's just...

1139
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:38,980
It's fine.

1140
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:42,484
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hm.

1141
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:45,647
I'm gonna go see if the DJ
will let me spin a few.

1142
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:48,388
Okay.

1143
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:52,920
Hey.

1144
01:08:53,396 --> 01:08:54,591
Why are you by yourself?

1145
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:58,000
Oh, I was just taking a breather.

1146
01:08:58,134 --> 01:08:59,227
Where's Amy?

1147
01:09:00,169 --> 01:09:02,434
Okay, what's your deal
with her anyway?

1148
01:09:02,572 --> 01:09:04,541
Kind of ditched her in the sixth grade.

1149
01:09:04,674 --> 01:09:06,472
Why? Amy's great.

1150
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:09,271
Amy is great.

1151
01:09:11,581 --> 01:09:13,948
I was afraid of always living
in her shadow.

1152
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:16,442
You?

1153
01:09:18,788 --> 01:09:21,917
So I guess no threat of that
with Hannah and Lola.

1154
01:09:22,959 --> 01:09:25,622
Anyway, Amy's downstairs
checking out music.

1155
01:09:25,762 --> 01:09:26,821
Uh-oh.

1156
01:09:27,063 --> 01:09:29,862
- What "oh"?
- That means she's B-O-R-E-D, bored.

1157
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,797
Seriously? What should I do?

1158
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:33,869
Be romantic, dork. Hold her hand.

1159
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:36,063
What, do I just grab it or...?

1160
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:37,696
Like this.

1161
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:39,767
Then what?

1162
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:42,469
Well, when she talks to you,
you wanna lean in.

1163
01:09:42,612 --> 01:09:44,513
Like this.

1164
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:50,911
- Hello?
- Uh...

1165
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:52,550
- Uh...
- Uh...

1166
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,923
Dylan had something in her contact.

1167
01:09:55,058 --> 01:09:56,185
You wear contacts?

1168
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:58,893
No, don't be silly. Contacts?

1169
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,997
I have totes perfect vision.
Josh was just...

1170
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:02,496
Yeah, just leaving.

1171
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:05,359
All right, who invited him anyway?

1172
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:13,206
Asher, wait, nothing was happening.

1173
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:15,140
Asher.

1174
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,279
Asher.

1175
01:10:22,418 --> 01:10:23,818
Asher.

1176
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:25,285
Excuse me, sorry. Asher.

1177
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:27,356
Asher, wait.

1178
01:10:28,091 --> 01:10:29,354
Call you later, Ash.

1179
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:30,851
What's going on?

1180
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:33,588
Oh, nothing, I'm just <i>très fatiguèe.</i>

1181
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:36,325
- But you never leave parties early.
- Well, I am now, okay?

1182
01:10:51,848 --> 01:10:54,784
Look, there's nothing going on
with Dylan, okay?

1183
01:10:56,219 --> 01:10:57,619
I believe you.

1184
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:00,513
Um...

1185
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:05,061
Would you wanna go
to the Spring Formal with me?

1186
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:09,131
Thanks, Josh.

1187
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:10,858
But, no.

1188
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,298
Why not?

1189
01:11:13,836 --> 01:11:16,965
Look, I don't think
you're secretly dating Dylan.

1190
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,131
But I think you want to.

1191
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:20,841
What?

1192
01:11:20,977 --> 01:11:23,037
Okay, N-O spells no.

1193
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:24,807
Never.

1194
01:11:26,082 --> 01:11:27,311
You even sound like her.

1195
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,444
I'm sorry.

1196
01:11:33,156 --> 01:11:34,590
Yeah.

1197
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:45,927
<i>Now back away, go away.</i>

1198
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:49,432
<i>And look.</i>

1199
01:11:49,572 --> 01:11:52,132
<i>And I'm free.</i>

1200
01:11:53,576 --> 01:11:56,375
<i>At the beach. Ha-ha-ha.</i>

1201
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:27,435
No, no, no.

1202
01:12:36,319 --> 01:12:38,311
No, no, no.

1203
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:42,786
No.

1204
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:45,060
No, no, no.

1205
01:12:47,263 --> 01:12:49,789
Here you go. Vote for Paterson.

1206
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:52,401
Hi, guys, don't forget to vote.

1207
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:54,401
For Paterson.

1208
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:56,466
There you go.

1209
01:12:56,606 --> 01:12:58,632
Hello. Vote for Paterson.

1210
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:02,277
Okay, here you go,
you have to vote, okay?

1211
01:13:09,185 --> 01:13:10,813
Dylan, what are you doing?

1212
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:13,683
Hannah and Lola.

1213
01:13:13,823 --> 01:13:16,019
Duh, I'm standing right here.

1214
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:17,319
What's with the fire hydrant?

1215
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:23,856
Oh, I was just checking it.
You know, safety first.

1216
01:13:24,667 --> 01:13:26,727
We don't have French class
until after lunch.

1217
01:13:27,937 --> 01:13:32,739
Yeah. I was just gonna study
for the pop quiz.

1218
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:34,434
We have a pop quiz in French?

1219
01:13:35,945 --> 01:13:37,914
You never know, right?

1220
01:13:39,115 --> 01:13:41,175
Hi, Principal Guthrie.

1221
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:43,750
The pressures of Blossom Queen.

1222
01:13:43,886 --> 01:13:45,946
It's made her totally snap.

1223
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:49,655
Look, I know the rough cut deadline
is tomorrow,

1224
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:51,693
but is there any chance
I can get an extension?

1225
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,230
I'd like to, but you know I can't, Josh.

1226
01:13:54,363 --> 01:13:58,494
As chair of the film committee,
it would look like I'm playing favorites.

1227
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:01,063
What's really going on?

1228
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:04,037
Honestly? I need help finishing the film.

1229
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:05,801
Josh,

1230
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,039
just tell the truth.

1231
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:10,373
Then your artistic vision
will shine through.

1232
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,444
Artistic vision. Got it.

1233
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:22,321
Listen, I'll talk to the
film festival board.

1234
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:26,885
If you can edit something by tomorrow
morning, I'll get them to save your slot.

1235
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:30,892
But I'm afraid
you haven't given yourself enough time

1236
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:33,730
to make something worthy of first place.

1237
01:14:35,571 --> 01:14:36,800
He's right.

1238
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:41,775
The post-republican period
of the ancient Roman civilization

1239
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:46,705
was characterized
by an autocratic government.

1240
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:49,978
An autocratic form of government.

1241
01:14:50,119 --> 01:14:53,521
In the late third century AD,

1242
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:57,252
Diocletian established the practice
of dividing an order between four...

1243
01:14:57,393 --> 01:15:00,022
Here, a note from Asher.

1244
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:01,790
What does it say?

1245
01:15:01,931 --> 01:15:03,263
Oh, you know, the usual.

1246
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:06,301
He adores me, et cetera, et cetera.

1247
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:09,303
Actually, it says he's breaking up
with you. Like, now.

1248
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:10,997
What?

1249
01:15:12,308 --> 01:15:14,777
You wear glasses?

1250
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,475
This will all be on the midterm.

1251
01:15:25,955 --> 01:15:27,446
Submit, submit.

1252
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:28,853
Asher.

1253
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:30,050
You look, Asher.

1254
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:31,490
- Asher, s...
- Dude.

1255
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:34,520
- Asher.
- What?

1256
01:15:34,663 --> 01:15:36,689
You're breaking up with me in a note?

1257
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:38,130
What about Spring Formal?

1258
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:39,997
Maybe Josh can take you. Whoa!

1259
01:15:40,636 --> 01:15:42,502
What's that supposed to mean?

1260
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:44,072
You've changed.

1261
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:45,299
You hang with nerds now.

1262
01:15:45,441 --> 01:15:46,704
You're even dressing like one.

1263
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:50,244
Oh, no. Look, look, see?
I'm the same old Dylan.

1264
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:53,081
Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.

1265
01:15:55,451 --> 01:15:57,113
Lates.

1266
01:16:12,168 --> 01:16:13,693
- Hey.
- Hey.

1267
01:16:13,836 --> 01:16:16,704
- I need to talk to you.
- Great. I need to talk to you too.

1268
01:16:16,839 --> 01:16:17,898
Let's eat outside.

1269
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:20,100
No, that's what
I wanna talk to you about.

1270
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:24,942
Okay, I can't have lunch with you today
or any day until after the film festival.

1271
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:27,239
What?

1272
01:16:27,383 --> 01:16:29,511
I haven't finished the movie yet.

1273
01:16:29,652 --> 01:16:31,746
Okay. And I gotta stay focused.

1274
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:34,513
And I really, really wanna win
that film prize.

1275
01:16:34,657 --> 01:16:36,888
And I really wanna win Blossom Queen.

1276
01:16:37,026 --> 01:16:38,995
So you better not mess this up,
geek, or I'll...

1277
01:16:39,128 --> 01:16:41,427
Or what?
You gonna ban me from The Ramp?

1278
01:16:41,564 --> 01:16:43,294
Your seat's already been taken.

1279
01:17:20,269 --> 01:17:21,931
<i>The Mummy</i>. Original or remake?

1280
01:17:22,071 --> 01:17:25,166
Original, directed by Karl Freund,
remake directed by Stephen Sommers.

1281
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:27,401
- I would say original.
- Remake.

1282
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:30,904
Well, look who deigned to join us.

1283
01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:33,072
Well, as president of the film club,
I think that...

1284
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:34,478
Not anymore.

1285
01:17:34,617 --> 01:17:36,245
What?

1286
01:17:41,056 --> 01:17:44,515
It's just you've been so busy going
to parties with the Populars lately...

1287
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:47,425
Instead of coming
to the mathlete scavenger hunt.

1288
01:17:47,563 --> 01:17:49,691
Guys, I am so sorry, okay?

1289
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:50,959
I completely forgot.

1290
01:17:59,141 --> 01:18:00,803
Okay.

1291
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:06,313
We decided to re-elect a new film club
society president in your absence.

1292
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:08,610
- What? Who?
- Me.

1293
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:10,077
Really?

1294
01:18:10,219 --> 01:18:12,654
Why don't you go cry
on your new BFF's shoulder?

1295
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:15,485
I heard Dylan and Asher
are D-O-N-E, done.

1296
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:17,058
He dumped her.

1297
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:27,160
Dare I ask?

1298
01:18:27,303 --> 01:18:28,703
How's it going?

1299
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:34,338
My friends expect one thing
and Dylan expects another.

1300
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:36,707
Mr. Farley wants me to tell the truth.

1301
01:18:37,346 --> 01:18:38,575
That's good advice.

1302
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:44,552
Hey, Mom, do you think it's okay
if my artistic vision has changed?

1303
01:18:45,354 --> 01:18:50,190
Well, I mean, yeah, I think it's okay
if your feelings have changed.

1304
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:54,894
I mean, your film should be about
the Dylan that you've come to know.

1305
01:18:58,801 --> 01:19:00,326
Good night.

1306
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:02,402
Night.

1307
01:19:03,138 --> 01:19:05,164
- Hey, don't stay up too late, okay?
- Yeah.

1308
01:19:09,812 --> 01:19:11,713
<i>Stop it.</i>

1309
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:27,094
Testing, one, two, three.

1310
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:35,932
I love it.

1311
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:38,273
It feels like a cupcake.

1312
01:19:43,345 --> 01:19:46,179
- What do you think about this one?
- It's so cute. I love the sparkles.

1313
01:19:46,315 --> 01:19:48,614
- Do you like my glove?
- Oh, I love those.

1314
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:52,415
Dylan.

1315
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:53,613
What are you doing here?

1316
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:56,891
This is my favorite boutique,
I'm always here.

1317
01:19:57,026 --> 01:19:58,995
You're shopping
for Spring Formal without me?

1318
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:02,425
Well, you're forever off shopping
with Josh these days.

1319
01:20:02,564 --> 01:20:06,934
Besides, we have dates to the dance
and you don't anymore.

1320
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:25,917
Lola,

1321
01:20:26,055 --> 01:20:29,025
defs get that dress. You look gorgeous.

1322
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,138
Marta, I'm home.

1323
01:20:43,272 --> 01:20:44,331
Hey, sweetie.

1324
01:20:44,473 --> 01:20:45,907
No plans with Josh tonight?

1325
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:48,943
- I think Josh and me are in a fight.
- Over the movie?

1326
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:52,442
I'm starting to wonder
if it was such a stellar idea after all.

1327
01:20:54,049 --> 01:20:55,608
Tell you what.

1328
01:20:55,751 --> 01:20:58,949
Why don't we have dinner,
just the two of us?

1329
01:20:59,088 --> 01:21:04,322
I was supposed to see Amber, but I can
quickly give her a call and cancel.

1330
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:06,224
We'll order in.

1331
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:09,491
I suppose your girlfriend can join us.

1332
01:21:10,299 --> 01:21:12,495
Just once.

1333
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:14,227
Really?

1334
01:21:16,572 --> 01:21:19,007
You are the best.

1335
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:22,738
I know.

1336
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:27,414
So I noticed that you have
some Serge Sanchez heels on.

1337
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:28,608
Oh, you noticed.

1338
01:21:28,751 --> 01:21:31,016
I love Serge so much.

1339
01:21:31,153 --> 01:21:33,452
Maybe you can borrow them.

1340
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:35,486
That would be awesome.

1341
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:39,153
So maybe Amber's not my mom,

1342
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:42,323
but she's not so bad either.

1343
01:21:42,531 --> 01:21:45,467
And they convinced me
to have a little bit more faith in Josh.

1344
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:47,763
The movie will be fine.

1345
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:49,629
Right?

1346
01:22:03,152 --> 01:22:04,950
As they say in show business,
break a leg.

1347
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:06,555
Wait, you guys still mad?

1348
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:08,782
No. Geeks stick together.

1349
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:10,085
Hi.

1350
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:22,934
Right.
Well, thank you, Josie Bel Bruno,

1351
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:25,540
for that fascinating film
about your pet hamster.

1352
01:22:30,913 --> 01:22:33,610
I certainly didn't know
that they were that vicious.

1353
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:38,180
Right, well, I would like
to take this opportunity

1354
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:42,655
to thank all the participants
in the festival, thank you.

1355
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:46,125
Well, without further ado,
it gives me great pleasure

1356
01:22:46,395 --> 01:22:51,129
to introduce Woodlands Academy's
official submission, Josh Rosen

1357
01:22:51,266 --> 01:22:54,794
and his documentary
called <i>The Popularity Project.</i>

1358
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:04,871
<i>Popularity.</i>

1359
01:23:05,013 --> 01:23:06,572
<i>What is it?</i>

1360
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:08,382
<i>According to Dylan Schoenfield,</i>

1361
01:23:08,517 --> 01:23:11,487
<i>one of the most popular girls</i>
<i>at Woodlands Academy,</i>

1362
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:12,918
<i>it's a lot of things.</i>

1363
01:23:13,055 --> 01:23:15,354
<i>Being popular is so not easy.</i>

1364
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:18,051
- We're in the movie.
<i>- It's like royalty or the first lady.</i>

1365
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:20,662
<i>You have to live up</i>
<i>to impossible standards of beauty</i>

1366
01:23:20,796 --> 01:23:22,788
<i>and you're expected</i>
<i>to be a good influence.</i>

1367
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:24,991
<i>Like I help out the less fortunate.</i>

1368
01:23:25,133 --> 01:23:26,294
<i>Fashion victims.</i>

1369
01:23:28,637 --> 01:23:30,333
<i>Popularity's contagious.</i>

1370
01:23:30,472 --> 01:23:33,408
<i>What, like a cold?</i>
<i>- Duh.</i>

1371
01:23:33,709 --> 01:23:36,178
<i>It's why Hannah and Lola battle</i>
<i>to be my better friend.</i>

1372
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:38,212
<i>Their popularity comes from mine.</i>

1373
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:43,815
<i>What are your plans after school?</i>

1374
01:23:43,952 --> 01:23:45,818
<i>Uh, Pilates. But not on Tuesdays.</i>
<i>That's yoga.</i>

1375
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:50,850
<i>I mean, when you graduate.</i>
<i>You know, hopes, dreams?</i>

1376
01:23:50,993 --> 01:23:52,962
<i>- What's your life goal?</i>
<i>- Blossom Queen.</i>

1377
01:23:55,097 --> 01:23:57,498
<i>After that.</i>
<i>- After?</i>

1378
01:23:57,633 --> 01:24:02,128
<i>If I don't win Blossom Queen,</i>
<i>my life is officially O-V-E-R, over.</i>

1379
01:24:04,106 --> 01:24:07,167
<i>So Populars only hang with Populars?</i>

1380
01:24:07,309 --> 01:24:09,335
<i>Cats don't hang with dogs, right?</i>

1381
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:12,071
<i>Really? That's your argument?</i>

1382
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:13,676
<i>It's better this way.</i>

1383
01:24:13,815 --> 01:24:17,149
<i>If everyone stays in their own group,
there's no chance of misunderstandings.</i>

1384
01:24:17,753 --> 01:24:20,348
<i>Like, what kind
of misunderstandings?</i>

1385
01:24:20,489 --> 01:24:23,152
<i>Well, take you and me, for instance.</i>

1386
01:24:23,292 --> 01:24:25,659
<i>If we mingled outside</i>
<i>of doing my movie together,</i>

1387
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:28,787
<i>you might get the wrong idea</i>
<i>and ask me out.</i>

1388
01:24:30,132 --> 01:24:33,000
<i>- Imagine the horror.</i>
<i>- You'd be so embarrassed.</i>

1389
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:42,875
<i>Did we get it? Was that good?</i>

1390
01:24:45,781 --> 01:24:48,273
So is Dylan the cat or the dog?

1391
01:24:53,555 --> 01:24:56,650
<i>Are you getting my good side?</i>
<i>This one right here?</i>

1392
01:24:56,792 --> 01:24:58,556
<i>Could one person be this shallow?</i>

1393
01:25:00,329 --> 01:25:04,289
<i>I chose Dylan as my documentary
subject because I wanted a challenge.</i>

1394
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:07,028
<i>To uncover the truth
about popularity.</i>

1395
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:10,002
<i>But I also wanted</i>
<i>to make something real.</i>

1396
01:25:10,138 --> 01:25:13,575
<i>I was determined to discover</i>
<i>the real Dylan Schoenfield.</i>

1397
01:25:13,709 --> 01:25:15,871
<i>Oh, no. The volleyball game's over.</i>
<i>Asher.</i>

1398
01:25:22,551 --> 01:25:23,814
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1399
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:36,665
Dylan, stop.

1400
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:38,426
Stop.

1401
01:25:38,567 --> 01:25:40,468
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

1402
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:43,071
The entire movie is what's wrong.

1403
01:25:43,205 --> 01:25:45,902
And it wasn't enough for you
to embarrass me in front of my friends.

1404
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:48,101
You embarrassed me
in front of the entire city.

1405
01:25:48,677 --> 01:25:49,736
Embarrass you?

1406
01:25:49,878 --> 01:25:51,403
But I was trying to show the real you.

1407
01:25:51,546 --> 01:25:54,141
And the real me is humiliating.

1408
01:25:54,282 --> 01:25:56,842
I've spent all of middle school
and high school

1409
01:25:56,985 --> 01:26:00,581
trying to get rid of the real me
and perfect the new Dylan.

1410
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:03,682
- Dylan, I...
- You don't get it and you never did.

1411
01:26:04,092 --> 01:26:07,654
I trusted you,
but you never cared about me.

1412
01:26:07,796 --> 01:26:10,664
All you cared about
was that stupid movie.

1413
01:26:10,799 --> 01:26:12,631
- That's not true.
- It's not?

1414
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,073
Just leave me alone, Josh.

1415
01:26:19,207 --> 01:26:22,439
And by that, I mean for and ever.

1416
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:40,758
<i>So the more I got to know Dylan, I
found out there's lots of sides to her.</i>

1417
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:46,358
<i>She can be funny and normal</i>
<i>and full of life.</i>

1418
01:26:46,501 --> 01:26:48,265
<i>Josh, Josh, look at this.</i>

1419
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:51,066
<i>Zoom in and look at it.
Josh, zoom in right here, right here. Look?</i>

1420
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:54,142
<i>Zoom in. Do you see that?</i>
<i>What's that say?</i>

1421
01:26:54,276 --> 01:26:56,745
<i>What's that say?</i>

1422
01:26:56,912 --> 01:26:58,141
<i>Hmm?</i>

1423
01:26:58,313 --> 01:27:00,373
<i>A plus.</i>

1424
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:01,983
<i>Whoo!</i>

1425
01:27:02,951 --> 01:27:05,978
<i>Yes. Stop it.</i>

1426
01:27:11,326 --> 01:27:17,664
<i>She can also be sensitive</i>
<i>and vulnerable and compassionate.</i>

1427
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:19,861
<i>Is that your mom?</i>

1428
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:24,029
<i>Yeah, she met my dad</i>
<i>at the Woodlands Spring Formal.</i>

1429
01:27:24,172 --> 01:27:25,231
<i>Crazy, huh?</i>

1430
01:27:26,441 --> 01:27:27,704
<i>Wait.</i>

1431
01:27:27,843 --> 01:27:30,403
<i>Was your mom Blossom Queen?</i>

1432
01:27:30,679 --> 01:27:34,912
<i>Back in the olden days, 1985. Heh.</i>

1433
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:36,680
<i>Wow.</i>

1434
01:27:36,818 --> 01:27:38,878
<i>I bet you miss her.</i>

1435
01:27:41,356 --> 01:27:43,086
<i>Lots.</i>

1436
01:27:44,326 --> 01:27:47,592
<i>It gets kind of lonely here</i>
<i>with just me and my dad.</i>

1437
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:53,498
<i>So when you said there's nothing more
to life than winning Blossom Queen...</i>

1438
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:56,329
<i>Yeah,</i>

1439
01:27:56,838 --> 01:27:58,739
<i>because of my mom.</i>

1440
01:28:00,408 --> 01:28:02,377
<i>If I win,</i>

1441
01:28:02,511 --> 01:28:05,140
<i>it's like we're still connected.</i>

1442
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:09,547
<i>Like she's still with me.</i>

1443
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:25,328
<i>And as I discovered</i>
<i>the real Dylan Schoenfield,</i>

1444
01:28:25,467 --> 01:28:28,198
<i>I figured, yeah, she
might be popular,</i>

1445
01:28:28,336 --> 01:28:32,239
<i>she might really like shoes,</i>
<i>but she's more than that.</i>

1446
01:28:32,374 --> 01:28:37,438
<i>She's smart and cool and real.</i>

1447
01:28:37,579 --> 01:28:39,946
<i>And that's the Dylan</i>
<i>I wanted to show the world.</i>

1448
01:28:40,081 --> 01:28:46,419
<i>Yeah, so maybe the truth didn't turn out
to be a hard-hitting exposé on popularity,</i>

1449
01:28:46,555 --> 01:28:48,114
<i>but I don't care.</i>

1450
01:28:48,356 --> 01:28:49,688
<i>I have a new friend.</i>

1451
01:28:49,958 --> 01:28:52,154
<i>That's what really matters.</i>

1452
01:29:10,478 --> 01:29:12,208
<i>Are you ready?</i>

1453
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:15,215
<i>Whoa. Here we go.</i>

1454
01:29:15,483 --> 01:29:17,042
<i>Whoa.</i>

1455
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:22,819
Hey.

1456
01:29:23,258 --> 01:29:26,228
Still hidden under the frog planter,
like in middle school.

1457
01:29:27,262 --> 01:29:28,355
What are you doing here?

1458
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:33,191
Look, Dylan, just because you stopped
being my friend in sixth grade

1459
01:29:33,335 --> 01:29:35,304
doesn't mean I stopped being yours.

1460
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:40,399
I know you went through a lot
when your mom died.

1461
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:43,535
I get it.

1462
01:29:45,013 --> 01:29:46,504
I still get it.

1463
01:29:47,749 --> 01:29:50,241
I don't know what to say.

1464
01:29:51,753 --> 01:29:53,483
Which, you know, for me,
never happens.

1465
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:05,056
Josh is worried about you.

1466
01:30:06,268 --> 01:30:07,896
Yeah, right.

1467
01:30:08,036 --> 01:30:10,767
Josh's terrible movie ruined me.

1468
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:13,933
My life is O-V-E-R, over.

1469
01:30:14,943 --> 01:30:17,344
Josh's terrible movie won
the film festival.

1470
01:30:18,713 --> 01:30:20,443
You're more popular than ever.

1471
01:30:24,552 --> 01:30:26,612
Josh gave me the DVD for his movie.

1472
01:30:26,755 --> 01:30:30,283
Watch all of it
and then tell me if you're ruined.

1473
01:31:16,771 --> 01:31:17,830
Dylan.

1474
01:31:18,173 --> 01:31:22,440
Dylan, you're the most popular girl
at Woodlands ever.

1475
01:31:22,577 --> 01:31:25,240
There you are. You don't have to hang
with the riff-raff anymore.

1476
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:26,939
Look, I got the dress.

1477
01:31:27,082 --> 01:31:28,914
You're right, your charity is fashion.

1478
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:31,349
What and ever, it's nothing compared
to your dress, Dyl.

1479
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:34,285
Oh, vintage is so in. Like you.

1480
01:31:34,422 --> 01:31:35,856
Hey, Dylan.

1481
01:31:35,991 --> 01:31:38,119
Looking, uh, smoking.

1482
01:31:40,695 --> 01:31:41,958
Dylan.

1483
01:31:43,098 --> 01:31:44,464
If I could have your attention.

1484
01:31:44,599 --> 01:31:45,862
Oh, it's starting.

1485
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:47,993
Ladies and gentlemen.

1486
01:31:48,269 --> 01:31:49,532
It's time, people.

1487
01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:54,166
The moment I have...
The moment you have been all waiting for.

1488
01:31:54,309 --> 01:31:58,770
It's time to announce
your Spring Formal Blossom Queen.

1489
01:31:59,481 --> 01:32:01,279
And let's just see.

1490
01:32:08,456 --> 01:32:11,119
And the winner is:

1491
01:32:12,861 --> 01:32:14,489
Dylan Schoenfield.

1492
01:32:18,566 --> 01:32:20,432
Go. Go.

1493
01:32:28,276 --> 01:32:31,508
Well played, Schoenfield. Well played.

1494
01:32:32,814 --> 01:32:33,873
Whoo!

1495
01:32:34,115 --> 01:32:35,242
Woohoo!

1496
01:32:51,466 --> 01:32:53,731
Recently, a documentary
was made about me

1497
01:32:53,902 --> 01:32:56,462
and I know some of you
may have seen it. Heh.

1498
01:32:57,272 --> 01:32:58,365
Um...

1499
01:32:58,506 --> 01:33:01,340
I would like to give you all an update.

1500
01:33:03,344 --> 01:33:07,577
I was wrong about
that cats and dogs stuff.

1501
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:12,180
Popularity isn't about having everyone
know who you are or what you're wearing

1502
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:16,519
or even winning Blossom Queen.

1503
01:33:17,058 --> 01:33:21,223
Popularity is about having real friends
who like you for you.

1504
01:33:21,663 --> 01:33:24,895
Not faux ones who ditch you
because a better offer came along

1505
01:33:25,033 --> 01:33:28,526
or bailed on you
because you became single

1506
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:31,731
and didn't have a date
to Spring Formal anymore.

1507
01:33:32,974 --> 01:33:34,408
It's about real friends.

1508
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:37,435
Who you can count on.

1509
01:33:37,579 --> 01:33:40,879
Even if it's been, like, forever
and they have pink hair and stuff.

1510
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:50,080
Friends who might not always be
into the same things as you,

1511
01:33:50,225 --> 01:33:51,420
but who will always be there

1512
01:33:51,559 --> 01:33:54,996
to share an
everything-but-the-kitchen-sink sundae.

1513
01:33:57,398 --> 01:34:00,891
It's not about being popular or a geek.

1514
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:08,933
It's about being around people
who make you happy,

1515
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:11,311
Like how I feel about Josh Rosen.

1516
01:34:41,643 --> 01:34:42,838
Oh.

1517
01:34:42,977 --> 01:34:44,309
- Hi.
- Hi.

1518
01:34:45,046 --> 01:34:46,514
You won the film festival.

1519
01:34:46,881 --> 01:34:48,315
And you won Blossom Queen.

1520
01:34:48,783 --> 01:34:50,308
I couldn't have done it without you.

1521
01:34:50,485 --> 01:34:51,544
Same here.

1522
01:34:52,587 --> 01:34:53,987
Amy showed me the whole movie.

1523
01:34:54,122 --> 01:34:57,024
Oh, you finally called it "the movie."

1524
01:34:57,759 --> 01:34:58,988
Our movie.

1525
01:34:59,394 --> 01:35:02,523
So does it have a happy ending?

1526
01:35:04,999 --> 01:35:06,627
You tell me.

1527
01:35:22,116 --> 01:35:23,448
True love prevails.

1528
01:35:23,585 --> 01:35:24,678
Gross.

1529
01:35:24,819 --> 01:35:27,550
I think it's kind of romantic.

1530
01:35:28,990 --> 01:35:31,687
You wanna dance, Steven?

1531
01:35:33,294 --> 01:35:35,923
- Does E equal MC...
- Squared?

1532
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:44,838
- Hi.
- Hi. Heh.

1533
01:35:44,973 --> 01:35:47,772
- Wanna dance?
- Huh?

1534
01:35:48,109 --> 01:35:51,170
What? Are you scared or something?

1535
01:35:51,446 --> 01:35:53,438
Me? Scared?

1536
01:36:22,677 --> 01:36:23,906
So that's our story.

1537
01:36:24,045 --> 01:36:25,809
The princess and the geek.

1538
01:36:25,947 --> 01:36:27,939
Film geek.

1539
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:30,775
I'm sorry I called you a nerd.

1540
01:36:30,918 --> 01:36:33,319
Sorry I called you a diva.

1541
01:36:44,399 --> 01:36:47,096
So I'm thinking, sequel?

1542
01:36:47,235 --> 01:36:49,033
Sequels are never
as good as the original.

1543
01:36:49,170 --> 01:36:51,298
Everyone knows that.
