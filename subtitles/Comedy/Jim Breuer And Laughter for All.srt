1
00:00:11,902 --> 00:00:13,003
I'm truly sorry,

2
00:00:13,132 --> 00:00:16,003
but it's just that this is a really important opportunity for me.

3
00:00:16,603 --> 00:00:18,903
Can you be understanding just once more?

4
00:00:20,203 --> 00:00:21,412
All right.

5
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:23,473
Really? Really?

6
00:00:23,673 --> 00:00:25,482
You're not upset, are you?

7
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,552
No, I'm not upset.

8
00:00:27,612 --> 00:00:29,953
You're not lying, are you? Are you really okay?

9
00:00:30,013 --> 00:00:31,783
Yes, I'm really fine.

10
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,792
Thank you Seo Jin. I really appreciate it.

11
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,692
Then I'll see you at home later. Okay?

12
00:00:43,163 --> 00:00:44,432
I'm all right.

13
00:00:46,663 --> 00:00:47,773
Really.

14
00:00:49,572 --> 00:00:51,042
I'm really all right.

15
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:56,642
What? You're making a contract with YS entertainment?

16
00:00:56,642 --> 00:00:57,983
Yes.

17
00:00:57,983 --> 00:01:02,012
That's great news! It's a big company with famous celebrities.

18
00:01:02,012 --> 00:01:05,323
People are finally realizing my talents as an actor now.

19
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:07,923
Really?

20
00:01:09,222 --> 00:01:10,423
Right. Seo Jin.

21
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,423
I'm sorry for bailing on you today.

22
00:01:13,963 --> 00:01:15,533
No, It's fine.

23
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,862
It was for work.

24
00:01:17,132 --> 00:01:19,533
And you had to go through so much trouble without management.

25
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:20,632
Congratulations.

26
00:01:20,903 --> 00:01:22,002
Thanks.

27
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,742
Jun Ki, you might really become famous now.

28
00:01:25,972 --> 00:01:28,742
Maybe I should get your signature in advance.

29
00:01:28,742 --> 00:01:32,343
I've been practicing my new sign. Do you want one?

30
00:01:32,882 --> 00:01:33,942
Sure.

31
00:01:33,942 --> 00:01:36,013
Okay. In that case,

32
00:01:36,283 --> 00:01:39,653
I'll give you my first signature.

33
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:46,823
Lee...

34
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:17,523
Gosh, I fell asleep.

35
00:02:20,123 --> 00:02:22,333
Jun Ki, isn't it finished yet?

36
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,033
Just wait a bit longer.

37
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:25,963
- Then I'll go to my room now. - What?

38
00:02:26,162 --> 00:02:29,172
I need to study to get my baking certificate.

39
00:02:29,172 --> 00:02:30,433
Really?

40
00:02:31,102 --> 00:02:33,743
When I'm done with this, I'll take it to your room.

41
00:02:33,942 --> 00:02:35,042
Okay.

42
00:02:35,042 --> 00:02:38,083
Now that the "Lee" part is over...

43
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:43,183
Jun...

44
00:02:55,632 --> 00:02:58,502
(The Dancer in the Dark)

45
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:02,102
Yes, Father.

46
00:03:03,373 --> 00:03:05,102
I'm going to sign the contract.

47
00:03:05,843 --> 00:03:09,713
Don't worry. I've read the contract in detail.

48
00:03:10,643 --> 00:03:13,713
Yes. I'll call you afterwards. Okay.

49
00:03:14,952 --> 00:03:16,512
What did he say? Is he happy?

50
00:03:16,512 --> 00:03:18,683
Yes. He doesn't show it,

51
00:03:18,683 --> 00:03:21,093
but I can feel how happy he is.

52
00:03:21,852 --> 00:03:23,493
I didn't expect this day to come.

53
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:25,493
You've finally turned your life around, right?

54
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:26,762
Right.

55
00:03:27,063 --> 00:03:29,533
I went through a lot for 10 years while working as a nameless actor.

56
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:32,232
Well, you did go through a lot.

57
00:03:34,403 --> 00:03:37,132
- You're going to act like that? - Tell me, you scum.

58
00:03:37,773 --> 00:03:38,843
I got fired again.

59
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,972
With ink like this...

60
00:03:42,313 --> 00:03:43,613
Gosh, even thinking about that is horrible.

61
00:03:44,382 --> 00:03:46,083
- I'm going now. - Bye.

62
00:03:48,783 --> 00:03:51,583
Where did Soo Ah go after making me answer...

63
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,283
all these inquiries on the shopping mall?

64
00:03:53,952 --> 00:03:56,222
Du Shik! Du Shik!

65
00:03:58,093 --> 00:04:00,023
- Look at this. - Why the fuss?

66
00:04:00,023 --> 00:04:02,563
- What is it? - I designed it myself.

67
00:04:02,563 --> 00:04:06,602
If we only resell products, we won't be able to go further.

68
00:04:07,102 --> 00:04:09,773
So you want to sell clothes that you've designed?

69
00:04:09,972 --> 00:04:11,472
Yes. Do you want to see it?

70
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:13,903
Look.

71
00:04:14,072 --> 00:04:17,812
It's Soorgio Armhany 2018 SS vintage collection,

72
00:04:18,042 --> 00:04:20,513
Ultra-V-Neck Sweater. What do you think?

73
00:04:20,513 --> 00:04:24,383
Well, but why is the chest part so exposed?

74
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:28,792
Normal V-necks are so normal, and they're not sexy.

75
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:32,763
This one has the V-neck line further down just above the navel.

76
00:04:32,763 --> 00:04:35,033
It emphasizes sexiness.

77
00:04:35,232 --> 00:04:36,693
What do you think? Isn't it cool?

78
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,903
It's cool, but I think...

79
00:04:39,162 --> 00:04:41,073
it's too exposed.

80
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:43,003
No, it's fine.

81
00:04:43,003 --> 00:04:45,472
People like unconventional designs nowadays.

82
00:04:47,472 --> 00:04:48,943
But why aren't you wearing it?

83
00:04:49,172 --> 00:04:50,273
What?

84
00:04:50,513 --> 00:04:52,742
You want me to wear it? Why?

85
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:55,412
You're the model. We should take a picture and upload it.

86
00:04:55,412 --> 00:04:56,753
What? Me?

87
00:04:56,753 --> 00:04:58,352
When, where, what, how, and why?

88
00:04:58,352 --> 00:05:00,482
You should just do it if your boss says so.

89
00:05:00,482 --> 00:05:02,422
- Be quiet, and follow me. - Why me?

90
00:05:02,422 --> 00:05:04,263
I'm busy, you bad boss.

91
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:07,562
- Follow me! - No, it will show my naval.

92
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:16,833
What do you think? Do you like the conditions?

93
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,472
Yes, it's all good.

94
00:05:18,472 --> 00:05:20,443
In that case, sign it.

95
00:05:21,843 --> 00:05:22,943
Should I?

96
00:05:27,283 --> 00:05:31,283
Lee...

97
00:05:34,153 --> 00:05:38,122
Jun...

98
00:05:40,362 --> 00:05:45,403
- Isn't it done yet? - Jun...

99
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:49,703
Ki...

100
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:54,812
It's done now.

101
00:05:55,073 --> 00:05:56,213
Really?

102
00:05:56,742 --> 00:05:58,883
I look forward to working with you.

103
00:05:58,982 --> 00:06:00,953
Thank you. I look forward to it too.

104
00:06:03,182 --> 00:06:05,953
So... See here.

105
00:06:06,023 --> 00:06:09,453
The baby tiger and the daddy tiger...

106
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:13,023
lived together happily ever after.

107
00:06:13,023 --> 00:06:14,292
The end.

108
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:18,932
Sol, what do you think the point of this story is?

109
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:23,833
The point of this story is "daddy".

110
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,172
Say "daddy".

111
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:29,843
Gosh, you're not easy, are you?

112
00:06:30,242 --> 00:06:34,042
Sol, please say "daddy".

113
00:06:34,153 --> 00:06:36,383
Just once? Please?

114
00:06:36,383 --> 00:06:38,922
- Say "daddy". - What are you doing?

115
00:06:39,852 --> 00:06:42,622
Nothing. I was reading a book for Sol.

116
00:06:47,122 --> 00:06:49,362
What is that? It looks like something a cool beggar would wear.

117
00:06:49,963 --> 00:06:51,432
What? A cool beggar?

118
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:54,302
It looks like it'd be really cool if you wore it.

119
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:56,232
Where did you buy that?

120
00:06:56,232 --> 00:06:57,472
I didn't buy this.

121
00:06:57,472 --> 00:06:59,903
Soo Ah designed this herself.

122
00:06:59,903 --> 00:07:02,312
What? Soo Ah makes clothes now?

123
00:07:02,312 --> 00:07:03,513
Yes.

124
00:07:03,513 --> 00:07:06,542
That's not the end. She wants me to wear it around for publicity.

125
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:09,883
Gosh, Min Soo Ah is definitely crazy.

126
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:12,523
- I'm home. - Hello.

127
00:07:12,523 --> 00:07:14,253
Hello. How was the contract?

128
00:07:14,253 --> 00:07:15,622
It was okay.

129
00:07:17,862 --> 00:07:19,722
What is that? It looks like something a cool beggar would wear.

130
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,963
He says Soo Ah designed it.

131
00:07:21,963 --> 00:07:23,533
Isn't it funny?

132
00:07:23,763 --> 00:07:27,133
It's so funny. I can see your naval.

133
00:07:27,133 --> 00:07:29,003
You're so open-minded. Gosh.

134
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:30,943
Seriously. Stop.

135
00:07:33,643 --> 00:07:36,513
What is this? Why did you stop talking when I arrived?

136
00:07:36,742 --> 00:07:38,542
You were saying bad things about me, weren't you?

137
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:39,783
No.

138
00:07:40,112 --> 00:07:43,083
We were complimenting your clothes.

139
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:44,953
He's right.

140
00:07:44,953 --> 00:07:48,093
It's great. It makes Du Shik look so much better.

141
00:07:49,453 --> 00:07:51,422
Really? Do you like it that much?

142
00:07:51,492 --> 00:07:52,922
- What? - What?

143
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,333
Now, look at you two.

144
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:58,903
Be quiet.

145
00:07:59,263 --> 00:08:00,732
What is this?

146
00:08:01,432 --> 00:08:04,773
You guys look like three cool beggar brothers.

147
00:08:04,773 --> 00:08:06,602
- Don't they? - They do.

148
00:08:07,003 --> 00:08:10,312
You look cool and sexy, Dong Gu.

149
00:08:10,312 --> 00:08:13,143
Why are you doing that, Yoon Ah? It's so embarrassing.

150
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:14,753
What is this?

151
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,682
But why is Soo Ah suddenly into designing?

152
00:08:17,682 --> 00:08:20,383
I don't know. She's so passionate,

153
00:08:20,523 --> 00:08:23,222
so I can't tell her it's weird. Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

154
00:08:23,492 --> 00:08:25,992
But still, what is this? Gosh.

155
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,162
- Right, Yoon Ah? - Exactly.

156
00:08:28,162 --> 00:08:30,492
It's a bit too extreme, right?

157
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,763
- It's... - Stop.

158
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:33,332
Hey, you were all here.

159
00:08:34,832 --> 00:08:37,373
What is this? Why are you all quiet again?

160
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:40,273
You've been saying bad things about me, haven't you?

161
00:08:40,273 --> 00:08:41,342
Of course not.

162
00:08:41,342 --> 00:08:43,342
We were saying...

163
00:08:43,342 --> 00:08:44,983
the sweater you designed looked awesome.

164
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,812
That's right. They look so sophisticated.

165
00:08:47,812 --> 00:08:49,052
It's so pretty.

166
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,383
Really? You like it that much?

167
00:08:55,592 --> 00:08:56,893
What is this?

168
00:08:57,123 --> 00:08:58,363
The sleeves are...

169
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:01,393
just too long.

170
00:09:01,393 --> 00:09:03,033
Oh, it's...

171
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:06,763
a part of Soorgio Armhany's 2018 SS Cutie Collection.

172
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:08,473
It's called Bongsan Number Five.

173
00:09:08,473 --> 00:09:11,503
It was inspired by the Bongsan mask dance.

174
00:09:13,143 --> 00:09:14,212
I see.

175
00:09:14,643 --> 00:09:18,013
But aren't the sleeves a bit too long?

176
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:21,452
That's the point.

177
00:09:21,552 --> 00:09:24,822
Existing hoodies look so boring.

178
00:09:24,822 --> 00:09:27,853
By adding extremely long sleeves,

179
00:09:27,853 --> 00:09:29,592
I gave the hoodie a cute look.

180
00:09:29,822 --> 00:09:32,393
What do you think? Isn't it so cute?

181
00:09:32,523 --> 00:09:35,162
It is. Thank you.

182
00:09:35,162 --> 00:09:36,263
You're welcome.

183
00:09:36,263 --> 00:09:38,462
Just wear it every day...

184
00:09:38,462 --> 00:09:40,503
so people can see it, okay?

185
00:09:40,503 --> 00:09:42,473
- Okay. - Okay.

186
00:09:42,702 --> 00:09:44,503
- We will. - Of course.

187
00:09:45,473 --> 00:09:46,542
Hello.

188
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:48,113
Yes.

189
00:09:48,572 --> 00:09:49,643
What?

190
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,283
Me?

191
00:09:52,143 --> 00:09:54,983
Okay.

192
00:09:55,952 --> 00:09:57,383
Who was it?

193
00:09:57,383 --> 00:09:59,223
It was the director of my agency.

194
00:09:59,383 --> 00:10:01,723
Choi Min Sik was supposed to throw the first pitch,

195
00:10:01,822 --> 00:10:03,653
but he caught the flu.

196
00:10:03,952 --> 00:10:07,123
So the director wants me to do it instead.

197
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:11,733
- You'll throw the first pitch? - For a professional game?

198
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:14,103
- Yes. - Congratulations.

199
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:16,432
Only real celebrities get to do that.

200
00:10:16,432 --> 00:10:17,503
I know.

201
00:10:17,603 --> 00:10:20,003
I guess this is a perk of having an agency.

202
00:10:21,243 --> 00:10:23,342
- I'll throw the first pitch. - I can't believe it.

203
00:10:23,712 --> 00:10:24,842
Congratulations.

204
00:10:25,342 --> 00:10:28,312
Let's go over first pitches that attracted a lot of attention.

205
00:10:28,613 --> 00:10:30,052
Clara's leggings.

206
00:10:30,353 --> 00:10:32,322
Cheng Xiao's 360° turn.

207
00:10:32,523 --> 00:10:35,292
Shin Soo Ji's acrobatic first pitch.

208
00:10:35,393 --> 00:10:36,993
After their first pitches,

209
00:10:36,993 --> 00:10:40,023
their images improved by 13-fold.

210
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:43,033
And the awareness increased by 20-fold.

211
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:44,432
Really?

212
00:10:44,662 --> 00:10:48,233
They hold a meeting for the first pitch?

213
00:10:48,503 --> 00:10:51,302
A big company sure is different.

214
00:10:52,143 --> 00:10:54,342
We need something new and different.

215
00:10:54,773 --> 00:10:55,842
Do you have any ideas?

216
00:10:55,842 --> 00:10:59,283
Jun Ki is playing an anchor in the drama.

217
00:10:59,513 --> 00:11:02,653
He could dress like Sohn Suk Hee...

218
00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:05,153
and throw a ball that looks like a microphone.

219
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:06,883
That sounds boring.

220
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:08,192
Do you have any other ideas?

221
00:11:08,893 --> 00:11:09,922
No?

222
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:13,662
There are so many of us. How can we have no other ideas?

223
00:11:18,403 --> 00:11:19,662
Honey.

224
00:11:20,662 --> 00:11:21,733
What?

225
00:11:23,172 --> 00:11:25,403
You want to learn pole dancing?

226
00:11:25,403 --> 00:11:28,243
Sure. Do whatever you want.

227
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:29,812
Okay.

228
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:32,983
Hold on.

229
00:11:33,743 --> 00:11:35,283
Pole dance?

230
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:43,253
Well...

231
00:11:44,192 --> 00:11:46,993
You want me to practice pole dancing here?

232
00:11:47,422 --> 00:11:50,432
The director doesn't want it to leak to the press.

233
00:11:50,903 --> 00:11:52,133
Confidentiality is everything.

234
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:54,702
But a pole dancing first pitch just sounds weird.

235
00:11:54,702 --> 00:11:56,973
I can't throw a ball while pole dancing.

236
00:11:56,973 --> 00:11:58,072
It doesn't make sense.

237
00:11:58,072 --> 00:12:00,503
What can we do? It's the director's idea.

238
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:03,013
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

239
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,143
Should we start practicing?

240
00:12:05,143 --> 00:12:08,383
I'll demonstrate for you. Watch carefully.

241
00:12:08,452 --> 00:12:09,513
Okay.

242
00:12:12,853 --> 00:12:13,883
Gosh.

243
00:12:18,493 --> 00:12:20,292
What do you think? Doesn't it look easy?

244
00:12:20,493 --> 00:12:22,493
No. I can't do this.

245
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:23,763
Please excuse me.

246
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:27,432
Come on. Practice makes perfect.

247
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:29,273
Let's start from hanging.

248
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,842
Hanging?

249
00:12:36,312 --> 00:12:37,513
Be serious.

250
00:12:37,513 --> 00:12:39,082
Use your arms. Try again.

251
00:12:42,682 --> 00:12:43,912
It's hot. Hey.

252
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:45,082
Again.

253
00:12:46,822 --> 00:12:47,822
Again.

254
00:12:49,552 --> 00:12:51,092
Ma'am!

255
00:12:51,092 --> 00:12:54,393
Help me! Ma'am!

256
00:12:55,763 --> 00:12:56,962
Gosh, it's killing me.

257
00:12:57,462 --> 00:12:58,633
Gosh.

258
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:02,432
After spending all day on the pole, my whole body aches.

259
00:13:02,603 --> 00:13:04,473
Is this really necessary?

260
00:13:04,473 --> 00:13:07,403
What can I do? It's the director's idea.

261
00:13:07,403 --> 00:13:09,273
I'm worried you'll hurt yourself.

262
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:12,412
It's okay. This is such a great opportunity.

263
00:13:13,883 --> 00:13:15,283
I... Gosh.

264
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,082
I'll work hard and become successful...

265
00:13:18,353 --> 00:13:20,582
so that I can give you...

266
00:13:20,582 --> 00:13:22,092
anything you want.

267
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:25,662
I'm so touched I want to cry.

268
00:13:27,192 --> 00:13:28,393
Bacca.

269
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:30,903
I don't think pain-relieving patches are enough.

270
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:32,903
I need something else too.

271
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:34,202
What do you mean?

272
00:13:36,773 --> 00:13:38,403
Gosh.

273
00:13:38,403 --> 00:13:40,273
Why did you hit me?

274
00:13:40,473 --> 00:13:43,243
If you have to hit me, do it with your lips.

275
00:13:43,243 --> 00:13:44,342
Forget it.

276
00:13:44,342 --> 00:13:46,942
- Don't be like that. - Stop.

277
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:52,223
We're not getting any orders.

278
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,082
Look at that.

279
00:13:54,082 --> 00:13:56,052
I knew no one would want that sweater.

280
00:13:56,523 --> 00:13:58,662
I hope no one I know sees this.

281
00:13:59,263 --> 00:14:01,432
I'll have to ask Soo Ah to take down these pictures.

282
00:14:04,263 --> 00:14:06,662
Soo Ah. By the way...

283
00:14:11,003 --> 00:14:12,842
She seems pretty serious.

284
00:14:13,702 --> 00:14:15,143
Did she fall asleep like this?

285
00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:22,113
Gosh, it stinks.

286
00:14:22,483 --> 00:14:23,853
What did she eat?

287
00:14:25,153 --> 00:14:26,322
What?

288
00:14:28,922 --> 00:14:31,092
Hey. What are you doing here?

289
00:14:31,092 --> 00:14:32,363
I just came by.

290
00:14:35,633 --> 00:14:37,363
What is it? Why are you laughing?

291
00:14:37,363 --> 00:14:38,733
Well...

292
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:41,873
I just farted in my dream.

293
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:46,503
It felt so real.

294
00:14:47,672 --> 00:14:48,942
Of course.

295
00:14:49,773 --> 00:14:51,243
I'm sure it did.

296
00:14:51,983 --> 00:14:53,113
Director Bong.

297
00:14:53,113 --> 00:14:55,883
Have we gotten any orders for the sweater I designed?

298
00:14:56,783 --> 00:14:58,552
Not yet.

299
00:14:58,753 --> 00:14:59,753
Really?

300
00:15:00,723 --> 00:15:02,692
Why isn't anyone buying it?

301
00:15:02,853 --> 00:15:04,792
Is my design that bad?

302
00:15:05,592 --> 00:15:08,792
It hasn't been exposed a lot yet.

303
00:15:09,162 --> 00:15:10,233
Cheer up.

304
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:11,733
- You think so? - Yes.

305
00:15:11,903 --> 00:15:14,133
Should we try to expose it more?

306
00:15:15,503 --> 00:15:16,702
I have an idea.

307
00:15:24,912 --> 00:15:26,613
What's that?

308
00:15:27,412 --> 00:15:29,812
This is Soorgio Armhany's new product,

309
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:32,383
Ultra-V-Neck Sweater. Take a look.

310
00:15:32,383 --> 00:15:33,422
Here.

311
00:15:33,422 --> 00:15:34,623
Take a look.

312
00:15:34,623 --> 00:15:38,123
It's so pretty, right? It looks amazing. It's so sexy.

313
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:40,322
Girls, take a look.

314
00:15:40,493 --> 00:15:41,993
Thank you.

315
00:15:42,562 --> 00:15:44,633
Come take a look.

316
00:15:45,503 --> 00:15:46,503
Hey.

317
00:15:48,432 --> 00:15:51,202
Thank you. We're Soorgio Armhany.

318
00:15:51,202 --> 00:15:54,442
- Soo Ah, I can't believe you. - It was designed by me.

319
00:15:54,442 --> 00:15:56,042
- This is just too much. - Soorgio Armhany...

320
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:58,283
- It's so embarrassing. - Ultra-V-Neck Sweater.

321
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:08,692
- You're getting the hang of it. - Right?

322
00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:10,993
I became a lot better after practicing all night.

323
00:16:11,723 --> 00:16:15,533
But I'm not sure if I can throw a ball while dancing.

324
00:16:15,832 --> 00:16:17,903
Is that so? Do you want me to help?

325
00:16:17,903 --> 00:16:19,062
I'm free today.

326
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,873
Really? That'd be great.

327
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:24,743
You're an angel.

328
00:16:25,802 --> 00:16:28,613
- Let's have fun at the playground. - Okay.

329
00:16:43,393 --> 00:16:45,922
Chae Rin, let's go to another playground.

330
00:16:55,773 --> 00:16:57,702
- Jun Ki. - Yes?

331
00:16:57,743 --> 00:16:59,172
Should we start?

332
00:17:00,672 --> 00:17:01,942
Will you be all right?

333
00:17:02,513 --> 00:17:04,042
You've never played baseball.

334
00:17:04,072 --> 00:17:06,042
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

335
00:17:06,213 --> 00:17:07,342
Throw the ball.

336
00:17:07,413 --> 00:17:09,983
Are you sure? Then I'll throw it.

337
00:17:15,892 --> 00:17:16,953
Seo Jin!

338
00:17:17,993 --> 00:17:20,392
Seo Jin! Are you okay?

339
00:17:21,392 --> 00:17:24,362
I'm okay. Try again.

340
00:17:25,132 --> 00:17:27,362
- I'll try again. - Okay.

341
00:17:27,362 --> 00:17:28,572
I'm sorry.

342
00:17:35,713 --> 00:17:36,812
Hold on.

343
00:17:41,013 --> 00:17:43,312
- I'm sorry. - You're doing great.

344
00:17:52,963 --> 00:17:54,163
Do you want to try?

345
00:18:12,013 --> 00:18:13,983
Designing clothes is not easy.

346
00:18:19,352 --> 00:18:21,792
How long do we have to wear these?

347
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:23,423
It's so embarrassing.

348
00:18:23,723 --> 00:18:25,622
Don't say that in front of Soo Ah.

349
00:18:25,693 --> 00:18:27,062
She's working hard.

350
00:18:27,062 --> 00:18:28,533
Still, this is just not okay.

351
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:31,503
No one would want this rag. Don't you think?

352
00:18:31,832 --> 00:18:33,733
Maybe we should tell her the truth and make her give up...

353
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,632
for her sake.

354
00:18:36,973 --> 00:18:38,173
We shouldn't just play along with her.

355
00:18:38,173 --> 00:18:40,102
- I'd rather go naked... - Gosh.

356
00:18:41,072 --> 00:18:42,072
Soo Ah.

357
00:18:42,342 --> 00:18:45,142
I get it. That's what you thought.

358
00:18:46,382 --> 00:18:48,582
- Soo Ah, it's not what you think. - I'm sorry...

359
00:18:49,052 --> 00:18:50,582
for forcing you to wear rags.

360
00:18:51,822 --> 00:18:54,322
Soo Ah. That's not what I mean.

361
00:18:54,322 --> 00:18:56,122
- Soo Ah. - Listen, Soo Ah.

362
00:18:56,122 --> 00:18:57,663
- Soo Ah. - Soo Ah.

363
00:19:00,892 --> 00:19:02,392
I'm sorry, Soo Ah.

364
00:19:02,993 --> 00:19:05,503
I didn't mean that you weren't talented.

365
00:19:05,832 --> 00:19:08,332
Your clothes are so unconventional.

366
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:11,072
It's hard for me to look good in them.

367
00:19:11,072 --> 00:19:12,902
He's right. Your clothes are pretty.

368
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,943
They don't look good because our bodies are ugly.

369
00:19:14,943 --> 00:19:17,013
Forget it. You're right.

370
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:18,983
I can't be a designer.

371
00:19:21,052 --> 00:19:23,652
- What's that sound? - There must be an order.

372
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,122
That's great.

373
00:19:26,822 --> 00:19:28,453
- What? - What's wrong?

374
00:19:28,622 --> 00:19:29,723
Look at this.

375
00:19:30,122 --> 00:19:32,122
I have orders for the v-neck sweater.

376
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,163
- Someone ordered 5. - 5?

377
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:36,763
What? Someone also ordered the hoodie.

378
00:19:38,203 --> 00:19:40,802
Some people buy them after all.

379
00:19:41,832 --> 00:19:45,503
Didn't I tell you that unconventional styles were popular?

380
00:19:45,703 --> 00:19:47,713
You know nothing about fashion.

381
00:19:49,443 --> 00:19:52,312
I'm sorry. I didn't have an eye for it.

382
00:19:52,312 --> 00:19:53,443
Right.

383
00:19:53,612 --> 00:19:56,352
We should be honored to wear such amazing clothes.

384
00:19:58,552 --> 00:20:01,993
Really? I have some clothes that I recently designed.

385
00:20:02,652 --> 00:20:04,092
- Do you want them? - What?

386
00:20:04,092 --> 00:20:05,163
What?

387
00:20:11,562 --> 00:20:12,963
- Soo Ah. - Yes?

388
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:14,473
What kind of shorts are these?

389
00:20:15,273 --> 00:20:19,703
They are a part of Soorgio Armhany's 2018 SS Sexy Collection.

390
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,673
They're called Ultra Fire Shorts.

391
00:20:21,673 --> 00:20:24,112
I shortened the length of the shorts...

392
00:20:24,112 --> 00:20:25,683
to focus on sexiness.

393
00:20:25,913 --> 00:20:27,812
- What do you think? - They're nice.

394
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:30,413
They're sexy and cool.

395
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:31,822
They're embarrassing.

396
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:33,652
Soo Ah.

397
00:20:33,852 --> 00:20:36,953
Aren't these too short though?

398
00:20:36,953 --> 00:20:39,963
Come on, that's the charm.

399
00:20:40,092 --> 00:20:43,062
I'm giving them to you as a special gift.

400
00:20:43,062 --> 00:20:46,503
Wear it every day so people can see it, okay?

401
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,773
- Okay. - Of course.

402
00:20:50,533 --> 00:20:51,703
They look great.

403
00:20:56,312 --> 00:20:58,542
You'll do well today, right?

404
00:20:59,013 --> 00:21:02,453
Of course. You helped me so much.

405
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:03,882
I have to do well.

406
00:21:04,523 --> 00:21:07,122
If you came and cheered for me,

407
00:21:07,253 --> 00:21:08,822
I would do better.

408
00:21:09,023 --> 00:21:11,763
I'm sorry, but I have work today.

409
00:21:11,763 --> 00:21:13,822
It's okay. Work can't be helped.

410
00:21:14,493 --> 00:21:15,592
Instead...

411
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:19,332
- Ta-da. - What's that?

412
00:21:19,902 --> 00:21:21,872
- Is it a mustache? - It's a lucky charm.

413
00:21:22,203 --> 00:21:23,302
Give me your hand.

414
00:21:24,142 --> 00:21:26,642
Even if I'm not with you, take a look at it.

415
00:21:26,642 --> 00:21:29,273
Think that I'm always beside you, okay?

416
00:21:29,943 --> 00:21:31,042
Thank you.

417
00:21:31,183 --> 00:21:32,882
You know that I'm your number one fan, right?

418
00:21:33,013 --> 00:21:35,652
Don't forget that I'm always cheering for you.

419
00:21:35,852 --> 00:21:36,953
I won't.

420
00:21:37,183 --> 00:21:39,923
I have another present.

421
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,493
What is it?

422
00:21:45,463 --> 00:21:47,193
You can do it, Jun Ki. See you later.

423
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,493
I can do it.

424
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:50,292
- Have a good time. - Bye.

425
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:51,463
You can do it.

426
00:21:57,773 --> 00:22:00,003
My goodness.

427
00:22:00,342 --> 00:22:01,872
I have to go to the office.

428
00:22:01,872 --> 00:22:04,842
How can I go while looking like this?

429
00:22:05,513 --> 00:22:08,852
I should get changed and leave from the window.

430
00:22:10,612 --> 00:22:12,082
Du Shik, may I borrow your laptop?

431
00:22:14,852 --> 00:22:15,993
What are you doing?

432
00:22:16,423 --> 00:22:19,193
Are you taking it off?

433
00:22:20,832 --> 00:22:22,993
No, I was putting it on.

434
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:25,402
I really like your clothes.

435
00:22:26,362 --> 00:22:28,302
Really? Where's Du Shik?

436
00:22:28,302 --> 00:22:30,433
He went out to meet a friend for a while.

437
00:22:34,872 --> 00:22:36,013
Yes, director...

438
00:22:36,973 --> 00:22:39,112
I'm on my way.

439
00:22:39,243 --> 00:22:41,882
I'll hurry. I'm sorry.

440
00:22:42,983 --> 00:22:44,852
Are you going to the office? See you.

441
00:22:44,852 --> 00:22:45,923
Thanks.

442
00:22:48,693 --> 00:22:50,862
You should go. Make sure many people see it.

443
00:22:50,963 --> 00:22:52,062
Okay.

444
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:56,092
- What is it? - I have something to take out.

445
00:22:57,332 --> 00:22:58,463
See you later.

446
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:01,902
Where is the laptop?

447
00:23:18,322 --> 00:23:19,453
What's this?

448
00:23:24,663 --> 00:23:26,263
These are the clothes that you asked for.

449
00:23:26,562 --> 00:23:27,963
Thank you.

450
00:23:29,163 --> 00:23:31,332
What's Soorgio Armhany anyway?

451
00:23:31,332 --> 00:23:33,433
Why do you ask me to order clothes for you?

452
00:23:34,203 --> 00:23:37,132
I have my reason. I'm sorry for bothering you.

453
00:23:37,132 --> 00:23:40,812
Are you wearing boxers? You look embarrassing.

454
00:23:41,413 --> 00:23:43,243
Everyone is looking at you.

455
00:23:44,243 --> 00:23:45,913
What? They look cute.

456
00:23:45,913 --> 00:23:48,582
Unconventional style is popular these days.

457
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,112
Hey.

458
00:23:50,753 --> 00:23:53,122
Do you want to try it on? Try it on.

459
00:23:53,122 --> 00:23:55,253
If you like it, recommend it to other people.

460
00:23:55,253 --> 00:23:56,493
Go on and try it.

461
00:23:56,723 --> 00:23:59,193
- Are you embarrassed? Try it. - Stop it!

462
00:23:59,193 --> 00:24:00,993
- Come on. - Keep it!

463
00:24:11,902 --> 00:24:13,572
You can start over now.

464
00:24:14,673 --> 00:24:15,943
You still have time.

465
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:19,382
Find work that will make you happy all your life.

466
00:24:19,683 --> 00:24:22,413
- Will I make it if I try? - I'll help you with studying.

467
00:24:22,413 --> 00:24:24,223
- You can do it, Soo Ah. - I can do it.

468
00:24:25,953 --> 00:24:28,152
I'll start an online shopping mall.

469
00:24:28,352 --> 00:24:29,592
It's Armhany.

470
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:33,622
- Shopping Mall Soorgio Armhany - Soorgio Armhany

471
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:36,332
How can I go home first when you're out here?

472
00:25:03,523 --> 00:25:05,562
- Soo Ah, what are you doing here? - What?

473
00:25:06,622 --> 00:25:08,792
- Nothing. Why? - Why are you annoyed?

474
00:25:08,933 --> 00:25:12,703
I borrowed a game from a friend. Want to play and bet on noodles?

475
00:25:13,463 --> 00:25:15,572
No, thanks. I'm tired, so I'll rest.

476
00:25:15,572 --> 00:25:16,673
You're a pig.

477
00:25:17,132 --> 00:25:18,542
What? Wait.

478
00:25:19,243 --> 00:25:21,842
Pig? Where did that come from?

479
00:25:21,943 --> 00:25:23,173
She's crazy.

480
00:25:26,142 --> 00:25:27,382
Did you practice a lot?

481
00:25:27,483 --> 00:25:29,312
Yes, I did my best.

482
00:25:29,382 --> 00:25:31,352
Good job. I guarantee you.

483
00:25:31,683 --> 00:25:33,453
If it gets aired, you'll become popular.

484
00:25:33,453 --> 00:25:35,423
- Do a good job. - Yes, sir.

485
00:25:35,592 --> 00:25:36,953
- Where's the outfit? - Yes, sir.

486
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:38,792
They're here.

487
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:43,392
Wait, why do you have this?

488
00:25:43,862 --> 00:25:46,632
It's a great outfit. It's perfect for pole dancing.

489
00:25:47,033 --> 00:25:49,033
Where did you buy this?

490
00:25:49,332 --> 00:25:52,503
There's a shopping mall that's popular among the stylists.

491
00:25:52,602 --> 00:25:54,842
- It's called Soorgio Armhany Mall. - What?

492
00:25:55,112 --> 00:25:56,612
Is Soorgio Armhany Mall popular?

493
00:25:56,612 --> 00:26:00,112
Yes, the owner is now selling clothes of her own brand.

494
00:26:00,283 --> 00:26:01,683
The designs are amazing.

495
00:26:01,783 --> 00:26:03,453
Isn't it unconventional and sexy?

496
00:26:03,612 --> 00:26:05,382
Yes, I guess.

497
00:26:08,223 --> 00:26:09,953
Good job on the interview.

498
00:26:10,253 --> 00:26:11,862
Since work is finished,

499
00:26:12,292 --> 00:26:14,433
shall we go somewhere to eat?

500
00:26:14,693 --> 00:26:16,792
- Sorry? Actually... - Yes?

501
00:26:17,332 --> 00:26:21,203
If there isn't more work to do, may I go somewhere?

502
00:26:21,533 --> 00:26:24,802
- I have something to do. - Well... All right.

503
00:26:25,003 --> 00:26:27,642
Thank you. See you tomorrow.

504
00:26:29,112 --> 00:26:30,312
Goodbye.

505
00:26:34,213 --> 00:26:37,582
You gave a shocking pole dancing performance today.

506
00:26:37,723 --> 00:26:40,122
The viewer response is already amazing.

507
00:26:40,122 --> 00:26:42,453
Where did you get the idea?

508
00:26:42,453 --> 00:26:46,092
The president of my agency came up with the idea.

509
00:26:46,392 --> 00:26:48,562
Many other people helped me...

510
00:26:48,562 --> 00:26:50,562
so that I could give a better performance.

511
00:26:54,632 --> 00:26:55,733
Seo Jin.

512
00:26:56,572 --> 00:26:58,773
- Hello, sir. - What brings you here?

513
00:26:58,773 --> 00:27:02,112
I was in the neighborhood, so I stopped by.

514
00:27:02,973 --> 00:27:04,943
Pole dancing couldn't have been easy.

515
00:27:04,943 --> 00:27:06,213
Wasn't it difficult?

516
00:27:06,283 --> 00:27:09,913
Of course, it was, but many people helped me.

517
00:27:10,183 --> 00:27:13,822
There's someone who helped me practice every day.

518
00:27:14,453 --> 00:27:16,523
As I stand here,

519
00:27:16,622 --> 00:27:19,392
I'd like to thank her very much.

520
00:27:20,193 --> 00:27:22,663
Is the person your girlfriend?

521
00:27:22,832 --> 00:27:23,933
It is, isn't it?

522
00:27:24,263 --> 00:27:26,703
Pardon? Girlfriend?

523
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,142
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

524
00:27:38,082 --> 00:27:41,382
Really? What's your ideal type?

525
00:27:41,852 --> 00:27:42,983
I'm not sure.

526
00:27:46,052 --> 00:27:47,493
Please support pole dancing.

527
00:27:53,822 --> 00:27:55,733
Jun Ki is still the most searched.

528
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,832
"Pole dancing 1st pitch" is the 2nd most searched.

529
00:27:58,003 --> 00:27:59,302
"I took a dump," is the third.

530
00:28:00,602 --> 00:28:02,402
You got so popular.

531
00:28:02,402 --> 00:28:04,602
Pole dancing worked, didn't it?

532
00:28:04,602 --> 00:28:07,612
I had no idea that the response would be so positive.

533
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:11,513
Life is full of surprises.

534
00:28:13,112 --> 00:28:15,753
There's one thing that makes me uncomfortable.

535
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,352
- What? - You don't have a girlfriend?

536
00:28:19,382 --> 00:28:22,352
Do you not want to be alive any longer?

537
00:28:23,652 --> 00:28:25,963
It's because the president...

538
00:28:25,963 --> 00:28:28,933
told me not to tell anyone that I have a girlfriend.

539
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:31,533
He was so adamant about it, so I couldn't help it.

540
00:28:32,203 --> 00:28:34,402
Seo Jin, I'm really sorry.

541
00:28:34,602 --> 00:28:36,733
I should have told you beforehand.

542
00:28:37,572 --> 00:28:38,973
It's okay.

543
00:28:39,372 --> 00:28:40,703
It can't be helped.

544
00:28:40,913 --> 00:28:42,312
Thank you for understanding.

545
00:28:43,812 --> 00:28:46,312
Jun Ki. Why did you wear that outfit?

546
00:28:46,443 --> 00:28:47,612
Aren't those the pieces Soo Ah made?

547
00:28:47,783 --> 00:28:50,052
Actually, my stylist brought that outfit.

548
00:28:50,513 --> 00:28:52,652
Apparently, Soo Ah's online shopping mall is really popular...

549
00:28:52,652 --> 00:28:53,822
among stylists these days.

550
00:28:53,822 --> 00:28:56,052
- What? Really? - I'm telling you.

551
00:28:56,292 --> 00:28:58,923
Stylists are praising her and saying that she'll become...

552
00:28:58,923 --> 00:29:00,163
the next Coco Chanel.

553
00:29:00,163 --> 00:29:02,163
- Coco Chanel? Really? - Yes.

554
00:29:04,362 --> 00:29:07,572
Gosh. I saw you do the ceremonial first pitch the other day.

555
00:29:07,572 --> 00:29:09,233
I noticed you received a huge response. It was amazing.

556
00:29:09,473 --> 00:29:10,473
Thank you.

557
00:29:10,473 --> 00:29:12,072
I should be the one thanking you.

558
00:29:12,072 --> 00:29:14,243
Thanks to you, our drama got promoted.

559
00:29:14,473 --> 00:29:16,473
I was meaning to ask you. You saw the script, right?

560
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:17,943
Yes, of course.

561
00:29:17,943 --> 00:29:20,882
How does it feel to play the opposing role of Cindy...

562
00:29:20,882 --> 00:29:22,652
who's receiving unconditional love from middle-aged men?

563
00:29:22,652 --> 00:29:23,913
It's an honor, of course.

564
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,723
By the way, who are all those people?

565
00:29:27,622 --> 00:29:28,852
They're Cindy's fans.

566
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,892
So they're the middle-aged male fans I've been hearing about.

567
00:29:31,122 --> 00:29:33,023
She really must be popular.

568
00:29:33,223 --> 00:29:35,463
- Look. Cindy's here. - It's Cindy. She's coming in.

569
00:29:35,533 --> 00:29:37,433

00:29:37,503 --> 00:29:39,463
- Stop them. - Cindy. Cindy.

00:29:40,233 --> 00:29:42,832

- Cindy. - Cindy.

00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:04,493
Now, this will be the next scene.

Hae Na, a rookie reporter, meets her first love, Song Jun Seok.

580
00:30:07,892 --> 00:30:11,102
Hae Na notices her first love and runs to Jun Seok...

581
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:12,763
and throws herself into his arms.

582
00:30:12,763 --> 00:30:14,132
- All right? - Yes.

583
00:30:14,132 --> 00:30:16,273
Let's start shooting right away then.

584
00:30:17,473 --> 00:30:19,372
We'll be starting the shoot now.

585
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:24,582
Ready and action.

586
00:30:26,612 --> 00:30:27,812
Jun Seok?

587
00:30:28,312 --> 00:30:29,312
Jun Seok.

588
00:30:31,223 --> 00:30:33,582
What do you think you're doing?

589
00:30:37,152 --> 00:30:38,163
Hae Na?

590
00:30:38,392 --> 00:30:39,562
It's you, isn't it?

591
00:30:39,562 --> 00:30:41,592
Jun Seok. It's been a long time.

592
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:45,203
Cut. All right. That was great.

593
00:30:45,362 --> 00:30:47,872
- We'll move onto the bus scene. - Yes, sir.

594
00:30:48,372 --> 00:30:51,342
I must've gotten lipstick on your clothes. I'm sorry.

595
00:30:51,342 --> 00:30:53,173
It could happen.

596
00:30:53,173 --> 00:30:54,312
Don't worry about it.

Did you finish the test? Did you do well?

No.

No. It's not just any other day. It's your birthday.

How could we possibly not celebrate?

I'll make it this time no matter what,

How can you not know your one and only sister's birthday?

646
00:33:29,332 --> 00:33:31,402
That would be expecting too much from you, right?

She's been gloomy the past several days.

Do you know any way I could cheer her up?

In that case, what's most important is...

655
00:34:00,023 --> 00:34:01,963
for you to find a way yourself.

656
00:34:02,392 --> 00:34:04,402

My goodness. Gosh.

664
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:27,552
What was that?

665
00:34:27,552 --> 00:34:29,853
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

666
00:34:30,123 --> 00:34:31,893
I dropped it by mistake while watering my plants.

667
00:34:33,192 --> 00:34:34,793
You should've been more careful.

668
00:34:35,493 --> 00:34:37,703
I could've gotten hurt!

669
00:34:37,862 --> 00:34:40,132
I'm truly sorry. Please forgive me. I'm sorry.

670
00:34:40,132 --> 00:34:41,373
Never mind. It's all right.

671
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:45,002
That scared me to death.

672
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:48,243
Taxi.

673
00:34:50,612 --> 00:34:52,283
Welcome, sir.

674
00:34:52,612 --> 00:34:53,813
Where would you like me to take you?

675
00:34:53,813 --> 00:34:55,482
JBC broadcasting station, please.

676
00:34:56,683 --> 00:34:58,552
I think I've seen you somewhere.

677
00:34:58,982 --> 00:35:00,152
You recognize me.

678
00:35:00,422 --> 00:35:02,652
You must've seen my pole dancing during the ceremonial first pitch.

679
00:35:02,652 --> 00:35:05,123
Pole dancing first pitch? What is that?

680
00:35:05,862 --> 00:35:06,993
Do you not know?

681
00:35:07,692 --> 00:35:09,533
Then you must watch the drama "Newsroom".

682
00:35:09,533 --> 00:35:10,663
"Newsroom"?

683
00:35:12,002 --> 00:35:13,833
That's right. You're Song Jun Seok.

684
00:35:14,973 --> 00:35:17,433
There was a scene where you hugged Cindy.

685
00:35:17,433 --> 00:35:19,772
You even remember specific scenes.

686
00:35:20,772 --> 00:35:22,272
You're right. That was me.

687
00:35:23,973 --> 00:35:25,842
Would you like my autograph?

688
00:35:25,842 --> 00:35:26,982
No, thank you.

689
00:35:27,513 --> 00:35:28,882
I'll be going now then.

690
00:35:37,723 --> 00:35:40,092
How could you get carsick from a taxi ride?

691
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:42,493
I don't even want to talk about it.

692
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:44,703
You wouldn't imagine how fast the driver was driving.

693
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:46,502
I thought I was going to die.

694
00:35:46,862 --> 00:35:47,973
Come to think of it, it's strange.

695
00:35:48,172 --> 00:35:50,772
Earlier on, a flower pot fell toward my head.

696
00:35:50,772 --> 00:35:52,703
I could've almost died.

697
00:35:53,302 --> 00:35:54,612
Today must be an unlucky day.

698
00:35:54,842 --> 00:35:56,013
I guess so.

699
00:35:57,543 --> 00:35:58,612
Hold on.

700
00:35:59,683 --> 00:36:01,183
That taxi driver...

701
00:36:01,982 --> 00:36:03,283
looked familiar.

702
00:36:03,783 --> 00:36:06,322
There was a scene where you hugged Cindy.

703
00:36:06,322 --> 00:36:09,393
Cindy. Milky-white Cindy.

704
00:36:10,322 --> 00:36:12,862
That's right. It was him. He's one of Cindy's middle-aged fans.

705
00:36:12,862 --> 00:36:15,462
What? The taxi driver was one of Cindy's middle-aged fans?

706
00:36:15,462 --> 00:36:16,462
Yes.

707
00:36:16,462 --> 00:36:18,902
He was one of the fans that came to root for Cindy on set.

708
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:20,873
Wait.

709
00:36:21,232 --> 00:36:22,502
My goodness.

710
00:36:22,502 --> 00:36:23,672
Are you all right?

711
00:36:23,672 --> 00:36:26,072
Cindy!

712
00:36:27,813 --> 00:36:31,683
Wait. That guy that dropped the flower pot was also Cindy's fan.

713
00:36:31,913 --> 00:36:33,942
That can't be. You must've mistaken them.

714
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,382
No. I'm positive.

715
00:36:35,482 --> 00:36:37,683
You don't think they're getting back at me...

716
00:36:37,882 --> 00:36:39,683
for hugging Cindy in that scene, do you?

717
00:36:39,683 --> 00:36:41,322
Gosh. That's nonsense.

718
00:36:41,322 --> 00:36:43,092
I don't think the fans would harass you for hugging her.

719
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:45,723
Right?

720
00:36:55,373 --> 00:36:58,072
Why would I? Why would I like Du Shik?

721
00:36:58,072 --> 00:37:01,543
He's not good-looking and doesn't even have a good body.

722
00:37:04,743 --> 00:37:05,783
But...

723
00:37:06,712 --> 00:37:08,353
he is cute in his own way.

724
00:37:09,513 --> 00:37:11,623
What am I saying? I'm crazy.

725
00:37:11,652 --> 00:37:13,953
I must've lost my mind.

726
00:37:13,953 --> 00:37:16,192
Get a hold of yourself. This isn't like you. What's wrong with you?

727
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,192
What are you doing?

728
00:37:17,462 --> 00:37:19,063
Why are you looking at a picture of me?

729
00:37:20,862 --> 00:37:22,033
I wasn't looking at it at all.

730
00:37:22,163 --> 00:37:24,033
I was just erasing your pictures because you're so ugly.

731
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,802
What? You brat.

732
00:37:26,362 --> 00:37:28,002
Never mind. Be quiet. Get out.

733
00:37:28,002 --> 00:37:29,873
You're so ugly. I don't want to look at you. Get out, you pig.

734
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,442
What? Pig?

735
00:37:31,442 --> 00:37:34,243
Hey. Why do you keep calling me a pig? Are you crazy?

736
00:37:36,013 --> 00:37:38,212
I don't want to talk to you, so get out, you pig.

737
00:37:38,942 --> 00:37:40,953
All right. I'll leave you, you fool.

738
00:37:41,382 --> 00:37:42,583
Go on farting.

739
00:37:47,283 --> 00:37:50,322
See? He's ugly and even has a bad temper.

740
00:37:52,123 --> 00:37:53,993
But he is kind of tough.

741
00:37:54,592 --> 00:37:55,663
He's sexy.

742
00:37:56,462 --> 00:37:59,103
Wait. What am I saying? I've gone crazy.

743
00:37:59,603 --> 00:38:01,203
No. This isn't me. This isn't me.

744
00:38:03,632 --> 00:38:04,643
He's amazing.

745
00:38:04,672 --> 00:38:06,603
(Song Jun Seok of "Newsroom" Pole Dances During the First Pitch.)

746
00:38:07,543 --> 00:38:08,813
Good job.

747
00:38:13,482 --> 00:38:16,052
(Actor Lee Jun Ki Is Currently Single!)

748
00:38:20,152 --> 00:38:23,793
What do you think you're doing? You should be working.

749
00:38:25,192 --> 00:38:26,362
It's Lee Jun Ki.

750
00:38:26,922 --> 00:38:28,433
This guy is really popular these days.

751
00:38:28,632 --> 00:38:30,192
You were a fan of Lee Jun Ki too?

752
00:38:31,703 --> 00:38:32,763
Yes.

753
00:38:33,263 --> 00:38:34,933
- You see, Jun Ki's my... - Yes?

754
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:39,772
No. I mean he's my brother's friend.

755
00:38:39,842 --> 00:38:40,842
Really?

756
00:38:41,072 --> 00:38:42,413
That's great.

757
00:38:42,413 --> 00:38:45,382
Then I'll ask you for help if I need an interview.

758
00:38:46,112 --> 00:38:47,212
- Sure. - Okay.

759
00:38:52,723 --> 00:38:55,252
Anyway, I'm going on a date soon. What should I wear?

760
00:38:57,723 --> 00:39:00,862
Is this the workroom of the rapper who's in charge of our soundtrack?

761
00:39:00,862 --> 00:39:02,933
Yes, he's called MC Dacopy.

762
00:39:02,993 --> 00:39:04,763
He's on the rise these days.

763
00:39:05,763 --> 00:39:07,732
His raps are great.

764
00:39:08,172 --> 00:39:09,402
Dacopy.

765
00:39:10,732 --> 00:39:12,942
He's here. Hello.

766
00:39:15,172 --> 00:39:16,272
What's up?

767
00:39:17,013 --> 00:39:18,112
Long time no see.

768
00:39:19,612 --> 00:39:21,212
Who's he?

769
00:39:21,212 --> 00:39:24,482
He's Kang Dong Gu, the production assistant.

770
00:39:25,723 --> 00:39:26,853
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

771
00:39:28,822 --> 00:39:30,692
- Put your fist up. - All right.

772
00:39:32,163 --> 00:39:34,092
- Nice to meet you. - Let's get it.

773
00:39:34,563 --> 00:39:36,592
How's the music going?

774
00:39:36,592 --> 00:39:38,462
It's okay.

775
00:39:38,933 --> 00:39:42,033
I heard that it's a spy movie in Dubai.

776
00:39:42,033 --> 00:39:44,772
I've prepared some samples that fit the concept.

777
00:39:44,772 --> 00:39:46,603
Do you want to hear them?

778
00:39:46,743 --> 00:39:48,272
- Shall we? - Okay, let's get it.

779
00:39:55,882 --> 00:39:57,882
Okay, let's get it.

780
00:40:12,462 --> 00:40:14,873
Dubai, Dubai, Dubai, Dubai

781
00:40:18,572 --> 00:40:19,743
How do you like it?

782
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:24,482
Isn't this Psy's "Champion"?

783
00:40:24,783 --> 00:40:26,482
I think you just changed the lyrics.

784
00:40:27,982 --> 00:40:30,313
What the... What did you say?

785
00:40:30,482 --> 00:40:33,022
Are you suggesting that I plagiarized?

786
00:40:33,022 --> 00:40:35,893
No, I just think it's similar.

787
00:40:36,922 --> 00:40:38,022
Oh, my gosh.

788
00:40:38,092 --> 00:40:41,663
Do you think it sounds like Psy's "Champion", Director?

789
00:40:41,663 --> 00:40:44,302
No, it's totally different.

790
00:40:44,962 --> 00:40:46,603
He doesn't know music.

791
00:40:46,732 --> 00:40:48,103
Don't mind him.

792
00:40:48,103 --> 00:40:50,373
Then I'll show you the next song.

793
00:40:50,373 --> 00:40:51,473
Okay.

794
00:40:57,212 --> 00:40:59,942
I never knew, but I knew

795
00:41:03,482 --> 00:41:04,953
Dubai

796
00:41:04,953 --> 00:41:06,783
I didn't know well

797
00:41:06,783 --> 00:41:09,623
But don't send me to Dubai

798
00:41:14,163 --> 00:41:15,993
Why's your expression like that?

799
00:41:15,993 --> 00:41:17,092
Well,

800
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:21,103
I think this one sounds a lot like Big Bang's "Lie".

801
00:41:22,572 --> 00:41:24,743
What are you talking about? It's totally different.

802
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:26,902
- What's wrong with you? - Well,

803
00:41:27,743 --> 00:41:29,442
I thought that the rhythms were similar.

804
00:41:30,043 --> 00:41:32,283
You're pickier than I thought. All right.

805
00:41:32,283 --> 00:41:35,152
I'll give you something you've never heard of.

806
00:41:35,152 --> 00:41:38,652
I wanted to change my style from traditional rapping.

807
00:41:39,123 --> 00:41:40,822
I'll let you listen to it.

808
00:42:00,402 --> 00:42:02,842
What? Have you heard of this too?

809
00:42:05,882 --> 00:42:07,982
Well, no. No.

810
00:42:08,353 --> 00:42:10,083
It's nice and new.

811
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:13,223
Yes, it's good.

812
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,592
We'll use this one.

813
00:42:17,052 --> 00:42:18,692
- Okay, let's get it. - All right.

814
00:42:18,893 --> 00:42:21,833
I'll work on it a bit more, and we'll discuss it more later.

815
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:22,962
Okay.

816
00:42:25,163 --> 00:42:27,033
I went to Dubai

817
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:28,933
I already memorized it.

818
00:42:31,703 --> 00:42:35,243
In this scene, Hae Na suddenly visits Jun Seok's house.

819
00:42:35,643 --> 00:42:38,143
You need to look at him for a few seconds...

820
00:42:38,143 --> 00:42:40,953
with watery eyes and then kiss him suddenly.

821
00:42:41,482 --> 00:42:42,982
- Do you understand? - Yes.

822
00:42:43,152 --> 00:42:44,422
We'll start shooting then.

823
00:42:44,422 --> 00:42:46,223
- Let's make it as real as possible. - Okay.

824
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:48,223
We're shooting.

825
00:42:49,422 --> 00:42:51,922
Get ready. Action!

826
00:42:51,993 --> 00:42:53,092
Who is it?

827
00:42:54,993 --> 00:42:57,293
Hae Na, what brings you here?

828
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,763
Jun Seok.

829
00:43:00,002 --> 00:43:01,373
Come inside. We can talk inside.

830
00:43:12,043 --> 00:43:13,143
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

831
00:43:13,183 --> 00:43:14,313
Are you all right?

832
00:43:14,313 --> 00:43:15,882
What are you doing?

833
00:43:15,882 --> 00:43:17,052
I'm sorry, sir.

834
00:43:17,212 --> 00:43:19,882
- Are you all right, Jun Ki? - I'm okay.

835
00:43:26,322 --> 00:43:27,422
Cindy?

836
00:43:27,422 --> 00:43:30,293
What's that? Cindy? Is he...

837
00:43:30,763 --> 00:43:32,862
We'll start the kissing scene again.

838
00:43:32,862 --> 00:43:34,473
All right.

839
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:37,973
Get ready. Action!

840
00:43:42,572 --> 00:43:43,743
- Are you all right? - Gosh!

841
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,783
Cut. What's wrong?

842
00:43:45,783 --> 00:43:49,313
- Jun Ki. Jun Ki, are you all right? - Yes.

843
00:43:49,783 --> 00:43:51,453
Are you out of your minds?

844
00:43:51,453 --> 00:43:53,283
What's wrong with everyone today?

845
00:43:53,382 --> 00:43:55,092
Gosh, what's wrong so suddenly?

846
00:43:55,453 --> 00:43:57,022
I'm sorry, Jun Ki.

847
00:43:57,022 --> 00:43:58,922
It's okay.

848
00:44:03,893 --> 00:44:05,462
Cindy?

849
00:44:05,763 --> 00:44:07,603
Is he also...

850
00:44:08,873 --> 00:44:10,132
Are you all right?

851
00:44:11,743 --> 00:44:14,442
Yes, I'm fine.

852
00:44:14,442 --> 00:44:17,112
We'll take a break until we have the light set up again.

853
00:44:17,342 --> 00:44:19,043
- Take a break, Jun Ki. - Yes.

854
00:44:23,013 --> 00:44:26,152
Something's not right. Something's going wrong.

855
00:44:26,422 --> 00:44:28,092
Jun Ki, are you all right?

856
00:44:28,493 --> 00:44:29,592
Something's wrong.

857
00:44:29,592 --> 00:44:33,063
I think all the staff members are Cindy's fans.

858
00:44:33,063 --> 00:44:34,563
Gosh, are you talking about that again?

859
00:44:34,563 --> 00:44:37,063
It's not like that. I'm sure there's something.

860
00:44:37,063 --> 00:44:39,132
Calm down and drink this.

861
00:44:40,563 --> 00:44:41,672
Thanks.

862
00:44:48,013 --> 00:44:50,442
What's wrong with this?

863
00:44:53,313 --> 00:44:56,183
Hey, the expiry date was a year ago.

864
00:44:56,783 --> 00:44:59,152
Really? I'm sorry.

865
00:44:59,552 --> 00:45:01,022
I just bought it from the shop.

866
00:45:01,022 --> 00:45:02,652
Gosh, it's fine.

867
00:45:03,152 --> 00:45:06,123
Hey, I don't have anything to do on Sunday, right?

868
00:45:06,123 --> 00:45:08,132
I have an important appointment.

869
00:45:08,293 --> 00:45:09,362
- Sunday? - Yes.

870
00:45:09,362 --> 00:45:10,462
Just wait a moment.

871
00:45:11,103 --> 00:45:12,433
Sunday.

872
00:45:14,502 --> 00:45:16,103
(My Love Cindy)

873
00:45:16,103 --> 00:45:19,873
Cindy? My manager is... He's also...

874
00:45:20,473 --> 00:45:23,373
- What's wrong? - It's nothing.

875
00:45:24,072 --> 00:45:26,583
Are you all right? Do you want some coffee to wake you up?

876
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:28,612
No! I'll never drink that!

877
00:45:28,882 --> 00:45:29,982
Why are you getting angry?

878
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,763
Jun Ki!

879
00:45:46,462 --> 00:45:48,033
This is it.

880
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:50,533
Park Seo Jun is my style,

881
00:45:51,243 --> 00:45:53,043
not Du Shik.

882
00:45:53,302 --> 00:45:54,473
How can he be?

883
00:45:56,643 --> 00:45:58,583
He's so handsome.

884
00:46:12,022 --> 00:46:13,263
What's wrong?

885
00:46:13,723 --> 00:46:15,763
You're out of your mind. Gosh.

886
00:46:16,293 --> 00:46:17,902
Min Soo Ah, you must be crazy.

887
00:46:19,462 --> 00:46:20,533
- What are you doing? - Gosh.

888
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:24,842
Why do you care what I do, you pig?

889
00:46:25,772 --> 00:46:27,643
You're calling me pig again. Hey!

890
00:46:27,643 --> 00:46:28,973
Why am I a pig?

891
00:46:28,973 --> 00:46:30,272
You stupid, dumb sea animal!

892
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,482
She must be a psychopath. She's crazy.

893
00:46:33,112 --> 00:46:34,382
Gosh, Jun Ki.

894
00:46:35,652 --> 00:46:36,813
Why are you so pale?

895
00:46:36,813 --> 00:46:39,152
Du Shik, I'm so scared.

896
00:46:40,313 --> 00:46:42,282
She must be a psychopath.

897
00:46:43,112 --> 00:46:44,382
Gosh, Jun Ki.

898
00:46:45,252 --> 00:46:46,413
Why are you so pale?

899
00:46:46,413 --> 00:46:48,752
Du Shik, I'm so scared.

900
00:46:48,821 --> 00:46:50,381
What are you afraid of?

901
00:46:51,821 --> 00:46:54,990
What? You think Cindy's fans are terrorizing you?

902
00:46:55,091 --> 00:46:57,830
Yes. Every time something weird happens,

903
00:46:57,830 --> 00:46:59,231
it involves her fans.

904
00:46:59,231 --> 00:47:01,700
I think they're revenging on me...

905
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,631
now that we are in love.

906
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:04,970
Does that make sense?

907
00:47:05,131 --> 00:47:06,501
You're paranoid.

908
00:47:06,501 --> 00:47:09,771
It's not that! I'm certain something's going on!

909
00:47:09,901 --> 00:47:11,811
You should just go to bed and get some sleep.

910
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:14,041
- You're just tired. - Really?

911
00:47:14,941 --> 00:47:16,140
Maybe that's it.

912
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,910
- It's get better when I rest. - You should go and rest.

913
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:21,521
All right.

914
00:47:23,481 --> 00:47:26,050
Gosh, it's so dangerous. It's dangerous outside this room.

915
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:27,251
It's dangerous.

916
00:47:32,961 --> 00:47:35,160
(I'll kill you, Jun Ki. Cindy is mine. Get away from her.)

917
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,631
Jun Ki, what's wrong?

918
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:42,140
Look at this. Cindy's fans are blackmailing me.

919
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:44,211
Someone must have been in here.

920
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:47,841
I can't be safe even in my own bed.

921
00:47:49,311 --> 00:47:51,711
Jun Ki, where are you going?

922
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,211
What's with him?

923
00:47:58,591 --> 00:48:01,160
(Stay away from Cindy, or you'll be dead meat.)

924
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:14,171
(My Love, Cindy)

925
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,280
What are you doing?

926
00:48:23,211 --> 00:48:25,010
I bought some sundae for you.

927
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,811
Thank you.

928
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:34,921
Are you still depressed about the exam?

929
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:36,821
No.

930
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:39,361
You have a lot of work these days, right?

931
00:48:39,361 --> 00:48:42,600
Yes. I'm leaving for Dubai in a week.

932
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,030
I have a lot to prepare.

933
00:48:44,231 --> 00:48:46,100
You'll be away for a month, right?

934
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,100
Yes.

935
00:48:48,171 --> 00:48:51,541
I'll miss you and Sol so much.

936
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:52,771
Should I just not go?

937
00:48:52,771 --> 00:48:54,981
Don't be silly.

938
00:48:55,381 --> 00:48:57,481
I hope you'll have a safe trip.

939
00:48:57,481 --> 00:48:58,550
I mean,

940
00:48:58,651 --> 00:49:01,620
I'm worried I'll fall for another girl.

941
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:09,160
I'm just joking to make you laugh.

942
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:10,260
I'm sorry.

943
00:49:12,091 --> 00:49:14,561
I met someone really funny today. Do you want to hear?

944
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,561
Who did you meet?

945
00:49:16,561 --> 00:49:19,700
I met the rapper who is working on our sound track.

946
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:23,100
But all his songs sounded so familiar.

947
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:26,510
He copied Psy, Big Bang, and iKon's songs.

948
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:29,140
All he did was change lyrics.

949
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,711
Really?

950
00:49:30,811 --> 00:49:32,651
What was his name?

951
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,881
MC Dacopy?

952
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,120
Oh, is he called Dacopy...

953
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,850
because he copies songs?

954
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:40,961
MC Dacopy?

955
00:49:40,961 --> 00:49:42,720
What? You've heard of him?

956
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,861
Of course. He's my favorite rapper.

957
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:49,830
He's the one who inspired me to dream of becoming a rapper.

958
00:49:50,561 --> 00:49:51,631
Really?

959
00:49:52,001 --> 00:49:54,200
It's my dream to meet him.

960
00:49:54,571 --> 00:49:56,470
Do you want me to introduce you to him?

961
00:49:56,841 --> 00:50:00,171
Really? That'd be so fantastic.

962
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:02,841
My goodness. You're finally smiling.

963
00:50:02,981 --> 00:50:04,211
Are you that happy?

964
00:50:04,211 --> 00:50:05,811
Yes, I'm so happy.

965
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:09,220
Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

966
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,280
My goodness.

967
00:50:13,091 --> 00:50:14,191
I can't believe it.

968
00:50:16,461 --> 00:50:17,861
- Hi. - Hi.

969
00:50:17,861 --> 00:50:19,430
Hi.

970
00:50:20,231 --> 00:50:21,700
Jun Ki, you're here.

971
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,970
You must be tired. Do you want some coffee?

972
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:26,930
Sure. Thanks.

973
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,050
I don't want to drink it. No!

974
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:59,030
Why are you eating alone?

975
00:50:59,271 --> 00:51:00,271
Let me join you.

976
00:51:02,001 --> 00:51:03,541
I'm okay.

977
00:51:03,941 --> 00:51:05,870
You have rice on your face.

978
00:51:26,361 --> 00:51:27,361
Give it to me.

979
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,660
I'm saving it for when I'm drunk later.

980
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,271
Don't touch it!

981
00:51:46,611 --> 00:51:47,921
Gosh.

982
00:51:48,821 --> 00:51:49,850
Cindy...

983
00:51:50,651 --> 00:51:52,450
You startled me.

984
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:55,591
Are you angry with me for something?

985
00:51:57,361 --> 00:51:58,530
No.

986
00:51:58,631 --> 00:52:00,461
Then why are you avoiding me?

987
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,461
You don't talk to me, and you ignore me when I say hi.

988
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,901
Did I do something wrong?

989
00:52:06,901 --> 00:52:08,870
No, that's not it.

990
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:11,041
Tell me if I did something wrong.

991
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,211
I'll try to change. Please.

992
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,510
Are you crying?

993
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:25,151
The thing is...

994
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,890
What's wrong?

995
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:29,691
I think something went in my eye.

996
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:33,061
Really? Let me see.

997
00:52:45,771 --> 00:52:49,111
Done. I've updated all our new products.

998
00:52:49,441 --> 00:52:50,541
I'm so tired.

999
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:52,550
What is Soo Ah doing? Why are you doing all the work?

1000
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:55,251
I don't know. She's so mean.

1001
00:52:55,251 --> 00:52:57,850
She never does any work, and she calls me a pig.

1002
00:52:57,990 --> 00:52:59,220
She's weird.

1003
00:52:59,691 --> 00:53:01,421
She's never been normal.

1004
00:53:01,421 --> 00:53:02,561
That's right.

1005
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:05,061
Now that I'm finished,

1006
00:53:05,061 --> 00:53:07,600
I'll play with the number of viewers...

1007
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,561
for "President Is Bruce Lee" a bit.

1008
00:53:12,271 --> 00:53:15,100
Hold on. "Lee Jun Ki" is the most searched word right now.

1009
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:18,111
Do you think it's the Lee Jun Ki we know?

1010
00:53:21,881 --> 00:53:22,941
What's that?

1011
00:53:22,941 --> 00:53:24,680
"Cindy and Lee Jun Ki are dating."

1012
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,950
"A secret date"?

1013
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,550
What? What are you talking about?

1014
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:30,580
Well...

1015
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:33,550
(Cindy And Lee Jun Ki's Secret Date)

1016
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:34,821
What's that?

1017
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:38,490
I don't know. What's going on?

1018
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,760
I'm back.

1019
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:43,660
What are you guys doing?

1020
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,631
Did you find something interesting? I want to see it too.

1021
00:53:46,631 --> 00:53:48,671
I want to see it.

1022
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:53,341
Wait. What is this?

1023
00:53:53,341 --> 00:53:55,180
What's going on?

1024
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:57,010
Did you kiss Cindy?

1025
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:00,251
No. What are you talking about?

1026
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:02,280
It's not true.

1027
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,850
It's just a misunderstanding.

1028
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:05,291
What's this picture then?

1029
00:54:05,291 --> 00:54:08,091
Well... She had something in her eye,

1030
00:54:08,091 --> 00:54:09,990
so I was blowing it out.

1031
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:11,631
It's true.

1032
00:54:11,861 --> 00:54:13,990
Seo Jin, you trust me, don't you?

1033
00:54:14,461 --> 00:54:16,330
Is that right?

1034
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,100
I knew it.

1035
00:54:19,671 --> 00:54:21,001
Gosh.

1036
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,100
Who wrote this article?

1037
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,910
Seo Jin, don't worry.

1038
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,780
I'll make sure a correction is published right away.

1039
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:28,780
Okay.

1040
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:40,021
(CEO)

1041
00:54:45,861 --> 00:54:48,600
Hello. Have you seen the article?

1042
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,030
It's a misunderstanding.

1043
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,970
Nothing is going on between Cindy and me.

1044
00:54:53,401 --> 00:54:55,240
We should publish a correction right away.

1045
00:54:55,341 --> 00:54:56,441
"A correction"?

1046
00:54:57,171 --> 00:54:58,870
Why? Just leave it.

1047
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:01,341
What? What are you...

1048
00:55:01,341 --> 00:55:03,680
Jun Ki. Who is Cindy?

1049
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,080
She's the nation's little sister.

1050
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,881
A scandal with Cindy will make you famous...

1051
00:55:08,881 --> 00:55:12,350
and bring you a ton of media coverage.

1052
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,260
Still...

1053
00:55:15,191 --> 00:55:17,361
Stay quiet for the time being.

1054
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:20,091
I'll make a comment at an appropriate time. Okay?

1055
00:55:20,091 --> 00:55:21,200
Well...

1056
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,030
Sir?

1057
00:55:25,571 --> 00:55:26,901
It's driving me crazy.

1058
00:55:30,571 --> 00:55:31,870
Well...

1059
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:33,071
(Lee Jun Ki and Cindy dating)

1060
00:55:33,071 --> 00:55:34,680
He's still on top.

1061
00:55:34,941 --> 00:55:36,811
More articles are coming out every second.

1062
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:41,220
What did he say? Will they publish a correction?

1063
00:55:41,751 --> 00:55:42,921
Well...

1064
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:45,990
The CEO wants to wait.

1065
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,861
- What? - Well...

1066
00:55:47,861 --> 00:55:51,561
He thinks the rumor will make me famous.

1067
00:55:52,131 --> 00:55:54,330
He wants me to stay quiet.

1068
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:57,131
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

1069
00:55:58,530 --> 00:55:59,571
Is that so?

1070
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:02,100
What can you do?

1071
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,510
I'm okay. Don't worry.

1072
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:07,841
Jun Ki, this is not okay.

1073
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,381
How would Seo Jin feel?

1074
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,910
She can't tell people you're his boyfriend,

1075
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:14,651
and she even has to put up with your dating rumors.

1076
00:56:14,651 --> 00:56:15,850
Isn't that too much?

1077
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:18,620
Seo Jin, I'm sorry.

1078
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:20,521
I really am.

1079
00:56:20,521 --> 00:56:21,620
Don't worry.

1080
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:23,561
It's not your fault.

1081
00:56:24,191 --> 00:56:26,660
By the way, when you hugged Cindy in the drama,

1082
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,131
her fans went crazy.

1083
00:56:28,131 --> 00:56:30,760
With the rumors spreading, won't they try to...

1084
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,100
kill you?

1085
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:34,800
Right. I'm in trouble.

1086
00:56:35,271 --> 00:56:37,071
And we're celebrating Seo Jin's birthday tomorrow.

1087
00:56:37,071 --> 00:56:39,271
We can celebrate at home.

1088
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:41,811
I've already booked a place.

1089
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:45,180
And we can't just stay home on your birthday.

1090
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:47,620
I'll figure it out.

1091
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:50,280
We are going on a date tomorrow, okay?

1092
00:56:50,651 --> 00:56:52,220
Okay.

1093
00:56:55,521 --> 00:56:57,791
Unbelievable.

1094
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:01,100
Let's get it.

1095
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,470
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1096
00:57:05,271 --> 00:57:07,131
Thank you for making time.

1097
00:57:07,131 --> 00:57:08,541
You're welcome.

1098
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:12,140
I had no idea your girlfriend...

1099
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,870
was my fan.

1100
00:57:14,071 --> 00:57:15,711
Neither did I.

1101
00:57:16,481 --> 00:57:19,711
Your music inspired me to dream of...

1102
00:57:19,711 --> 00:57:21,521
becoming a rapper.

1103
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:23,381
But I've given up.

1104
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:24,691
Really?

1105
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,550
You dreamed of becoming a rapper?

1106
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,120
Let's get it.

1107
00:57:34,501 --> 00:57:37,200
Now that you're here,

1108
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,030
why don't you try recording something?

1109
00:57:40,001 --> 00:57:42,271
- Really? - Of course.

1110
00:57:42,441 --> 00:57:43,571
Give it a try.

1111
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:45,910
It'll be a good time. It would be memorable.

1112
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:47,370
Which song would you like to sing?

1113
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,441
Your main song...

1114
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:53,680
"Mapo Bridge" is my favorite. May I sing it once?

1115
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:54,950
Sure, why not?

1116
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,450
Go to the recording room. Let's get it.

1117
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:57,490
Okay.

1118
00:58:02,321 --> 00:58:05,061
Yoon Ah, let's get started.

1119
00:58:05,061 --> 00:58:06,691
- Don't be nervous. - Okay.

1120
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:08,260
Okay, let's get it.

1121
00:58:14,841 --> 00:58:18,041
It's the same as "Yanghwa Bridge" by Zion.T.

1122
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,481
I can't believe this. Unbelievable.

1123
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:33,350
I was always alone at my home

1124
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:36,021
Mother was a bus driver

1125
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,430
When I asked her where she was

1126
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:40,291
It was always Mapo Bridge

1127
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:43,401
Let's be happy

1128
00:58:43,631 --> 00:58:45,930
Let's be happy

1129
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:48,271
Don't be sad

1130
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:50,870
Don't be sad

1131
00:58:51,941 --> 00:58:53,140
Wait, Yoon Ah.

1132
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,740
Yes, what is it?

1133
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,711
Your singing reminds me...

1134
00:58:57,111 --> 00:58:58,780
of Zion.T.

1135
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,220
You seem confused with "Yanghwa Bridge" by Zion.T.

1136
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:05,021
This is my song, "Mapo Bridge".

1137
00:59:05,021 --> 00:59:07,050
It's not "Yanghwa Bridge". You know what I'm saying?

1138
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,990
Yes, I'm sorry.

1139
00:59:09,591 --> 00:59:12,660
Don't ever sing like Zion.T, okay?

1140
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:14,901
- Okay. - Let's start again.

1141
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,200
Let's get it.

1142
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,580
I was always alone at my home

1143
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:33,280
Mother was a bus driver

1144
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,651
When I asked her where she was

1145
00:59:35,651 --> 00:59:37,421
It was always Mapo Bridge

1146
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,490
Let's be happy

1147
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:41,591
Stop it, stop it.

1148
00:59:42,961 --> 00:59:45,291
You sound like Zion.T again.

1149
00:59:45,591 --> 00:59:48,561
This song is completely different.

1150
00:59:48,561 --> 00:59:49,930
Why do you keep getting confused?

1151
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:52,271
Yanghwa Bridge and Mapo Bridge...

1152
00:59:52,271 --> 00:59:54,740
are at least over 1km apart.

1153
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:58,711
There's Seogang Bridge in between. How are you confused? I mean...

1154
01:00:01,381 --> 01:00:03,240
Be happy... No.

1155
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:06,611
Let's be happy

1156
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:09,050
Let's be happy

1157
01:00:09,321 --> 01:00:11,350
Is this so hard?

1158
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:12,921
I'm sorry.

1159
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:17,691
Let's do it one last time.

1160
01:00:17,691 --> 01:00:18,791
Okay.

1161
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:28,300
Gosh, Bacca.

1162
01:00:29,171 --> 01:00:32,341
- You look so pretty today. - Really?

1163
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:35,080
We haven't gone on a date in a while, so I dressed up.

1164
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,580
- Do I look okay? - Yes, you look beautiful.

1165
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,711
- Shall we go? - Okay.

1166
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:42,881
I almost forgot. Wait.

1167
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:48,990
- What are you doing? - In case reporters catch me,

1168
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:51,691
the president told me to go outside like this.

1169
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:54,030
Really?

1170
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:56,030
Okay, let's go.

1171
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:57,800
Let's go.

1172
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:03,671
Welcome.

1173
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:07,370
Do you have reservations?

1174
01:01:08,711 --> 01:01:10,850
- Chewbacca. - Please go that way.

1175
01:01:18,421 --> 01:01:19,450
Wait just a moment.

1176
01:01:20,151 --> 01:01:21,191
Here.

1177
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,561
The chair is going in.

1178
01:01:32,501 --> 01:01:33,571
Thank you.

1179
01:01:33,671 --> 01:01:36,501
Anyway, will you keep those on?

1180
01:01:36,501 --> 01:01:37,611
What do you mean?

1181
01:01:39,211 --> 01:01:40,910
Oh, I should take these off.

1182
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:45,050
You should order, Seo Jin.

1183
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:47,751
I'll buy you everything that you want today.

1184
01:01:47,751 --> 01:01:49,881
Really? I'm so excited.

1185
01:01:50,481 --> 01:01:51,821
What shall I eat?

1186
01:01:52,421 --> 01:01:54,861
Yes, I just arrived.

1187
01:01:55,091 --> 01:01:57,830
The interview just ended. Yes.

1188
01:01:58,430 --> 01:01:59,691
Which room was it?

1189
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:01,561
On the right? Okay.

1190
01:02:03,401 --> 01:02:06,030
Gosh, I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

1191
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:07,640
It's okay.

1192
01:02:12,711 --> 01:02:15,311
What shall we eat? How about this?

1193
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:21,521
Let's see.

1194
01:02:22,151 --> 01:02:23,950
Sirloin? Tenderloin?

1195
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:26,220
Seo Jin, decide what you want.

1196
01:02:26,321 --> 01:02:28,490
- I'm going to the restroom. - Okay, go ahead.

1197
01:02:29,521 --> 01:02:30,591
Sirloin?

1198
01:02:44,041 --> 01:02:45,140
Pardon me.

1199
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,740
You're Lee Jun Ki, right?

1200
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,280
No, you're mistaken.

1201
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,111
Come on, you are Lee Jun Ki.

1202
01:02:52,111 --> 01:02:54,111
I saw you sitting in the room.

1203
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:57,921
Mr. Lee, could you say something about your romantic life?

1204
01:02:58,050 --> 01:02:59,120
Do you admit it?

1205
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,691
- I'm not Lee Jun Ki. - Come on.

1206
01:03:00,691 --> 01:03:04,231
Then why don't you lower your mask a bit?

1207
01:03:04,231 --> 01:03:06,131
I'll let you go if you aren't him. Show me a little.

1208
01:03:06,131 --> 01:03:07,961
- Lower it a little. - Goodness.

1209
01:03:07,961 --> 01:03:10,361
- Wait, Mr. Lee Jun Ki. - Gosh.

1210
01:03:10,361 --> 01:03:12,830
Wait, Mr. Lee Jun Ki!

1211
01:03:18,267 --> 01:03:20,249
Why isn't he back yet?

1212
01:03:21,398 --> 01:03:23,227
(Jun Ki)

1213
01:03:23,457 --> 01:03:25,997
It's him. What's going on?

1214
01:03:27,898 --> 01:03:30,238
Jun Ki, why aren't you back yet?

1215
01:03:30,437 --> 01:03:33,037
Seo Jin, a reporter is chasing me.

1216
01:03:33,537 --> 01:03:36,577
I can't go back to the restaurant. What should I do?

1217
01:03:36,977 --> 01:03:38,077
What?

1218
01:03:38,178 --> 01:03:39,307
I'm really sorry.

1219
01:03:42,247 --> 01:03:43,678
Gosh, she's still chasing me.

1220
01:03:43,977 --> 01:03:46,318
See you later at home. I'm sorry.

1221
01:04:22,557 --> 01:04:23,887
Seo Jin, you're home.

1222
01:04:24,687 --> 01:04:26,628
I'm sorry about what happened.

1223
01:04:27,088 --> 01:04:29,157
A reporter was waiting for me in the hallway.

1224
01:04:29,727 --> 01:04:33,698
She asked me if the rumor was true. I couldn't help but run away.

1225
01:04:35,068 --> 01:04:36,838
I'm really sorry.

1226
01:04:39,338 --> 01:04:43,207
Seo Jin, I'm really sorry.

1227
01:04:47,108 --> 01:04:48,918
I have something to say.

1228
01:04:49,048 --> 01:04:51,347
You do? What is it?

1229
01:04:52,887 --> 01:04:54,718
Let's take some time to think.

1230
01:04:56,418 --> 01:04:57,528
What?

1231
01:04:59,057 --> 01:05:01,198
"Take some time to think"?

1232
01:05:02,827 --> 01:05:04,128
What do you mean by that?

1233
01:05:05,028 --> 01:05:06,227
I mean...

1234
01:05:07,497 --> 01:05:10,198
we should reconsider our relationship.

1235
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:13,108
What?

1236
01:05:15,707 --> 01:05:17,878
What's wrong with him?

1237
01:05:18,008 --> 01:05:20,718
"Yanghwa Bridge" and "Mapo Bridge" sound the same.

1238
01:05:21,048 --> 01:05:24,418
He's the one who copied the song. Why did he take it out on you?

1239
01:05:26,347 --> 01:05:28,358
Yoon Ah, cheer up.

1240
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:29,887
He was the one who was acting strange.

1241
01:05:30,687 --> 01:05:32,387
It's okay.

1242
01:05:33,157 --> 01:05:35,528
I gave up on being a rapper anyway.

1243
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:39,997
Dong Gu.

1244
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:44,608
Why can't I do anything well?

1245
01:05:45,307 --> 01:05:48,307
I can neither bake nor rap.

1246
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:49,838
Come on.

1247
01:05:50,977 --> 01:05:53,247
Don't think so negatively.

1248
01:05:53,448 --> 01:05:54,548
I'm sorry.

1249
01:05:55,477 --> 01:05:58,418
I know that you're trying to cheer me up,

1250
01:05:59,448 --> 01:06:00,758
but I can't cheer up.

1251
01:06:03,758 --> 01:06:05,887
You can't do this anymore.

1252
01:06:06,358 --> 01:06:09,798
Yoon Ah, I prepared something for you.

1253
01:06:10,698 --> 01:06:11,827
What is it?

1254
01:06:14,468 --> 01:06:16,737
Yes, get it

1255
01:06:17,468 --> 01:06:20,907
The first wound stays in the heart, the tears fall

1256
01:06:21,008 --> 01:06:22,508
Even if you're lonely or sad

1257
01:06:22,508 --> 01:06:23,878
Don't cry

1258
01:06:23,878 --> 01:06:25,207
My dear Yoon Ah

1259
01:06:25,707 --> 01:06:28,478
What are you doing, Dong Gu?

1260
01:06:28,478 --> 01:06:30,617
Look at my eyes

1261
01:06:30,617 --> 01:06:31,787
Forget about MC Dacopy

1262
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:34,558
Erase everything, and run

1263
01:06:34,558 --> 01:06:36,457
Run toward your dream, just go

1264
01:06:36,457 --> 01:06:37,558
Where?

1265
01:06:39,728 --> 01:06:41,397
Let me start over. Again.

1266
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:42,728
Just Go

1267
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:47,668
You're laughing, right?

1268
01:06:47,668 --> 01:06:49,098
Then you're feeling better, right?

1269
01:06:51,768 --> 01:06:54,508
It sure is hard to cheer you up.

1270
01:06:54,808 --> 01:06:56,237
Gosh. That was embarrassing.

1271
01:06:56,237 --> 01:06:58,348
Why? You're a good rapper.

1272
01:06:59,848 --> 01:07:01,247
I could never be as good as you.

1273
01:07:01,418 --> 01:07:04,287
Gosh, Sol. What do you think about my rap skills?

1274
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:10,957
(Ms. Han Yoon Ah, Congratulations. You've passed the test.)

1275
01:07:11,787 --> 01:07:13,058
Why? What is it?

1276
01:07:13,228 --> 01:07:14,798
I passed the test.

1277
01:07:15,457 --> 01:07:18,098
I passed the baking license test.

1278
01:07:18,098 --> 01:07:19,228
Really?

1279
01:07:21,197 --> 01:07:24,537
You see? What did I tell you? I told you you'd pass the test.

1280
01:07:24,537 --> 01:07:25,737
Congratulations, Yoon Ah.

1281
01:07:26,037 --> 01:07:27,168
Thank you.

1282
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:28,638
Wait a minute.

1283
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,577
We should celebrate on a day like this.

1284
01:07:30,577 --> 01:07:31,707
Let's have a party.

1285
01:07:32,147 --> 01:07:34,418
Wait here for a minute. I'll go buy a cake, all right?

1286
01:07:34,678 --> 01:07:35,718
Dong Gu.

1287
01:07:42,018 --> 01:07:43,058
Yoon Ah.

1288
01:08:06,247 --> 01:08:09,678
(Welcome to Waikiki)

1289
01:08:09,678 --> 01:08:11,787
What? Sol's father's here?

1290
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:13,117
Why are you here?

1291
01:08:13,388 --> 01:08:14,487
Daddy.

1292
01:08:14,487 --> 01:08:16,058
Blood really must be thicker than water.

1293
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:18,758
I'd like to take care of Yoon Ah and Sol.

1294
01:08:18,758 --> 01:08:20,258
After all this time, you want to take care of them now?

1295
01:08:20,258 --> 01:08:21,897
I still love Yoon Ah.

1296
01:08:21,897 --> 01:08:24,027
This won't change anything.

1297
01:08:24,027 --> 01:08:25,897
But it won't change the fact that I'm Sol's father.

1298
01:08:25,897 --> 01:08:28,138
I want to ask you for your forgiveness. Is that wrong?

1299
01:08:28,138 --> 01:08:30,567
Why do I keep thinking of Du Shik? Why?

1300
01:08:30,567 --> 01:08:32,008
You're crazy, Soo Ah.

1301
01:08:32,008 --> 01:08:33,867
You've completely lost your mind.

1302
01:08:34,808 --> 01:08:36,707
- My stomach. - What's wrong? Are you sick?

1303
01:08:36,707 --> 01:08:38,207
Is there a Bong Du Shik here?

1304
01:08:38,207 --> 01:08:40,947
I have something to say to you.

1305
01:08:41,048 --> 01:08:43,317
I think I...

1306
01:08:43,518 --> 01:08:46,418
I thought I was a strong person, but I guess I'm not.

1307
01:08:46,718 --> 01:08:50,388
You mean you're going to let go of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity?

1308
01:08:50,388 --> 01:08:51,428
You should move out of there first.

1309
01:08:51,428 --> 01:08:54,428
- So? - I'm breaking up with Seo Jin.

1310
01:08:54,428 --> 01:08:56,497
I'd like to tell you all the truth...

1311
01:08:56,497 --> 01:08:59,268
about the romance rumor between Cindy and myself.
