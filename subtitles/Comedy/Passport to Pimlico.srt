5
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,969
'You've been listening
to a programme of lunchtime music

6
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:15,087
'by Les Norman
and his Bethnal Green Bambinos.'

7
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:44,761
- You gonna be at that meeting tonight?
- Afraid so.

8
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,298
- Try and keep it short, Dad.
- Hm.

9
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:54,465
<i>I</i> I don't want to set the world on fire

10
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,382
<i>J</i> I just want to start...

11
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,344
- Pair of kippers to wait for Mrs White.
- Okey-doke.

12
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,631
See any difference?

13
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,378
- What's the matter? Gone off?
- No, in me.

14
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,334
- What's all that oily muck?
- The shiny look, they call it.

15
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,756
- Do you like it?
- Not much.

16
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,969
- No wonder we're short of fat.
-  Frank!

17
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:19,421
Frank, Mum wants to know
if you've got any cod fillets.

18
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:22,011
I've got something better. Fancy a
nice bit of bream for your supper?

19
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,459
- Mm, yes.
- Ah, it's a treat to see it again.

20
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:29,383
My old dad used to say that this one
was the most human fish of 'em all.

21
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,343
If I was a bream, I'd resent that.

22
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,756
Oh, I'll tell you a most
remarkable thing about the bream.

23
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:37,709
When he's courting,
he grows a little white wart just here.

24
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,298
Just like you, or I might buy a new hat.

25
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:42,886
Well, I must be going now.
I'm ten minutes late already.

26
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,968
I'll fetch it over
with a nice big piece of ice.

27
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,585
All right.

28
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,132
Some people get jam on it-.

29
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,719
Wrap this up and put it in the fridge.

30
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,427
- Hello, Benny.
- Hello.

31
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,459
Phew! 94 degrees on Air Ministry roof.

32
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,256
Right, I'll keep off it.

33
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,379
- Any more about us there?
- Yeah.

34
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,552
"It is now believed that Pamela, the
last unexploded bomb in the London area,

35
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:29,968
"will be removed from Miramont Place,
Pimlico, on Tuesday next."

36
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,085
- We hope.
- Oh, it's gotta be, mate.

37
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:35,052
They want it for the exhibition
on local arts and culture.

38
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:38,137
You can pack it up, boys.

39
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,504
Art and culture's had it.
We're not defusing after all.

40
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,343
- Not, sir?
- We've got to blow her up.

41
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,428
- What, in her state of health?
- We've got to.

42
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:51,173
They've discovered another last bomb
so Pamela goes up tomorrow.

43
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:55,172
The police are sending a chap
round now to warn the population.

44
00:05:56,542 --> 00:05:59,011
What are you talking about?

45
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,550
Two bob to win on Silver Street
at 13 to 8. That's 5 and 3.

46
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:04,886
Any to Come Equator, you had.

47
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,594
Heard about the bomb, Fred?
Setting her off tomorrow.

48
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,712
- Oh, they're setting her off, are they?
- Have to change your pitch.

49
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,302
Bit of bad, Gold Cup Day.

50
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:20,170
This one's me, all right.

51
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:24,752
Think it'll go with my taffeta?
That check skirt I got up west?

52
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,253
Lovely. Three guineas, dear.

53
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,174
- Oh.
- Make it pounds. I'm easy.

54
00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:32,636
Ta, Edie.
I've got three coupons somewhere.

55
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,334
- Four, dear. Same as Bond Street.
- Oh, go on, be a pal.

56
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,552
I want it for Miss Pimlico night
at the Palais.

57
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:41,921
Oh, that. Proper old fiddle. Always was.

58
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:44,295
OK, I'll put it by.

59
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:46,090
Oh, no.

60
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,381
Look, I tell you what.

61
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:51,761
Oh, all right.

62
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:56,130
- Well, and what have I been up to?
- Huh! Make me blush to guess.

63
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,335
Well, it's no good you settling down
for a mike. It's time I had a wet.

64
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,298
I've come here to save your life.
They're blowing up that bomb tomorrow.

65
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,174
- They're blowing it up?
- You'll have to take a walk.

66
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,545
I suppose they couldn't make it
early closing day.

67
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:12,342
- Wouldn't upset trade enough.
- You can't pick and choose with bombs.

68
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:22,297
- Governor in, Bert?
- If it's about the bomb, he knows.

69
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:27,422
- Bert! You going to be all night?
- Coming, Governor.

70
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:42,007
A trifling matter like that, sir, I...
I didn't want to bother Head Office.

71
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,377
Trifling?

72
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,218
We regard it as a serious matter

73
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,587
that a man in your position should make
these decisions without our authority.

74
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:52,886
Excuse me, sir.

75
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,798
Sorry, sir.

76
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:14,295
A sense of responsibility
is a very excellent thing, Wix.

77
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:16,419
We quite appreciate that.

78
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,756
But if we start giving a free hand
to the manager of a minor branch,

79
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,173
we'd find ourselves in Queer Street.

80
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:28,297
Head Office don't consider you a second
Montagu Norman yet, you know,

81
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:31,045
and they like to have some idea
of what's happening here.

82
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:32,447
Then Head Office had better know

83
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,755
that I and my staff intend knocking off
at three o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

84
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:41,334
Seems funny, Arthur, having
to come and tell you about a bomb.

85
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,758
You're telling me. Took a warden
to nose 'em out in the old days.

86
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,502
They aren't half making
a mess-up of this one.

87
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,923
He really misses
that old white helmet of his.

88
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:56,544
Good evening, ladies.
Now, what can I do for you?

89
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,089
Mum wants a mop.

90
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,461
What, another? She had one last week.

91
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,883
What did she do with that, eh?
Fetch your dad one over the ear with it?

92
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,049
Don't tease the child, Arthur.
Give her a mop.

93
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,719
- Hello! That's a new one, isn't it?
- Yes, he finished it last night.

94
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,803
Spent half the morning
getting the mess off the carpet.

95
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:20,751
It's an idea for that dump out there.
Give those kids somewhere decent to play.

96
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:26,919
They seem to be
doing pretty well <i>as</i> it is.

97
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:30,091
I'd have something to say
if I was their mother.

98
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,489
- Nice job you've got there.
- Something to pass the time.

99
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:34,044
Pass the time indeed!

100
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:37,626
Stayed up till two o'clock
to get it ready for the Council meeting.

101
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:43,009
It'll be quite simple to turn
the old water tank into a swimming pool.

102
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:47,301
I, er... l think we've discussed
this matter long enough, gentlemen.

103
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:51,342
Those in favour
of Mr Pemberton's, er... project.

104
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,709
Those in favour of selling
this piece of ground.

105
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:07,136
Well, that seems to settle it.

106
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,504
We've got to face economic facts,
Mr Pemberton.

107
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,754
This borough is in no position just now
to finance daydreams.

108
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,128
That's just plain ridiculous.

109
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,673
Don't you ever think of anything
besides pounds, shillings and pence?

110
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:21,636
Withdraw that remark!

111
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:25,511
If everybody is quite settled now,

112
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,128
I should like to read
the proposed advertisement.

113
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:34,178
"For sale, freehold. Valuable building
land in much sought-after position.

114
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:37,796

premises or factory site.

115

"Thoroughly safe investment."

120
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:10,372
What have you been up to, you little devil?
Little devil, that's what you are.

121
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,501
Wasn't me. It was him.

122
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,674
I reckon it was about six to four
on him coming home in a sack.

123
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,334
- Came down on my funny bone.
- Went right up in the air, I did.

124
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,631
So will your father
when he hears about this.

125
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,503
All I can say is
some people are born lucky.

126
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,423
- Oh!
- Arthur!

127
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,675
- Dad, where are you?
- Where is he gone?

128
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,628
- Somebody do something!
- Hold on!

129
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,752
- Here's a rope!
- Mr Pemberton!

130
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,627
Mr Pemberton! Are you all right?

131
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,798
Are you all right, Mr Pemberton?

132
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,215
Oh, I'm having a grand time.

133
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,423
Arthur!

134
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,502
Don't worry, we're getting him up.

135
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,085
Right!

136
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,176
Heave!

137
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:09,010
Take it easy!

138
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,173
Stick to it, Dad! You'll make it!

139
00:12:11,292 --> 00:12:13,511
Hold tight, dear.

140
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,548
You all right?

141
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,386
- Hey, what happened?
- Thank you, boys.

142
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,344
I'm all right. Don't worry, don't fuss.
I'm all right, I tell you.

143
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,756
- You have hurt yourself.
- No, I haven't.

144
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,469
- Just like old times, eh?
- Hello, Ted. Yeah, just like.

145
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:30,258
You turn up when it's all over.

146
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,128
Now, come on. Which of you was it?

147
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:37,137
Come on. Who was it?

148
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,254
- Which of you was it?
- Don't lie!

149
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:44,005
- It's always that kid of yours.
- He never touched that wheel.

150
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:46,885
- Steady, steady.
- Well, sit still, then.

151
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,673
" - Shirley!

152
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:51,466
OK, I'll go.

153
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,177
- That'll do, that'll do.
- No, it won't. Stay where you are.

154
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:56,010
Playing about like a schoolboy.

155
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,127
I don't know why you ever wanted
to go down the blessed hole.

156
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,878
I didn't want to go down the hole.
I fell down.

157
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,469
Well, you shouldn't have gone so close.

158
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,257
- Who was it?
- Frank with the ice.

159
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:10,428
- You didn't go to the door like that?
- Yes, of course.

160
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:13,386
It's the only sensible kind of thing
to wear in this kind of weather.

161
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,755
Downright indecent, I call it.
Whatever must that man have thought?

162
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,719
Exactly the same <i>as</i> all the other men
thought last year at Bournemouth.

163
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,586
- I thought I was seeing things again.
- Seeing things?

164
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:28,544
Yes, when all that stuff fell on my
head, I fancied I saw a kind of cave

165
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:30,510
with a load of treasure in it.

166
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:35,176
- Treasure?
- Yes, goblets, jewels, gold coins and...

167
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:38,136
Look out, look out.
It's all getting down my neck.

168
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:45,261
Did you say gold coins?

169
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,927
Oh, that's one of those kids
worked off a dud on you.

170
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:52,215
It is gold, isn't it?

171
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:57,468
Come on. I'll fetch a ladder.
You grab a couple of torches.

172
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:02,043
Arthur, don't be daft. Come back. Shirley!
Arthur, your supper's just on ready!

173
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,336
Now, I wonder where that was.

174
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:21,215
Oi.

175
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,506
All right, all right. Come on, come on.

176
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,677
Shine the light here, will you?

177
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,548
Keep your light there.

178
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,256
There.

179
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,302
Cor! Someone's been
saving up for a rainy day.

180
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:58,545
Look at all this stuff.

181
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,553
- Look, there's a coat of arms.
- Look at this.

182
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:06,511
Must be hundreds of years old.

183
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,877
What's that?

184
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,584
Hm. They even had to fill up forms
in those days.

185
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,756
- Hell t
- Yes? o here!

186
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,253
What on earth are you playing at?

187
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,378
We've found some buried treasure
down here.

188
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,502
- What?
- Loads of it, worth a million!

189
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,548
Nip round to the police
and give them the wire!

190
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:37,376
We're going to find out all about
an old picture! Meet you in the library!

191
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:40,761
Yes, it's his
crest, right enough.

192
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:46,427
Yes, a shield of pretense
or a lion rampant gules.

193
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:47,759
Yes, just as I said.

194
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:51,796
Except that you called it a mangy
old poodle up on its hind legs.

195
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,670
- Well, if you want to split hairs.
-  I've told 'em!

196
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:58,376
Proper sensation! They've put two men
on guard over it. Found anything?

197
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,798
Plenty.
Do you know whose crest this is?

198
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:02,544
- No.
- The Duke of Burgundy.

199
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:05,386
- Who's he? Frenchman?
- This chap here.

200
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,260
Burgundy was a country on its own
in his day.

201
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:10,094
Well, what was he doing leaving his
stuff lying around in Miramont Place?

202
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:14,418
Well, that's what we're trying to ferret out.
You can help. Here, take this.

203
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:17,341
Look up "Burgundy, Grand Duke of".

204
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,173
Miramont House.

205
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:24,169
- This sounds promising.
-  Mm.

206
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:30,095
"Destroyed by fire in 1490,
the property of Maurice de Charolais."

207
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,427
- He's got the right sort of name.
- Yeah.

208
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:35,921
Do you hear that, Frank?
If you find any mention of Maurice de...

209
00:16:37,417 --> 00:16:39,260
Frank.

210
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,503
Really, Frank.

211
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,593
Oh, I'm sorry.

212
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,085
Butjust think of it.

213
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:50,338
A saltwater fish that can blow itself up
to three times its own size.

214
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:53,758
Don't you realise what this means?
It's history.

215
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,344
History, my foot. It's money!

216
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,343
Over this way a bit.

217
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:21,965
And what are your plans for the future,
Mr Pemberton'?

218
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,801
Oh, I don't know, maybe I'll retire,

219
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:27,296
sail around the world in my own yacht
with a cargo of beautiful girls.

220
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:31,172
Oh, hark at him!
Seasick on the Serpentine!

221
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:34,671
I suppose I'll get something out of it.
I'm not counting my chickens yet, though.

222
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:37,762
- Oh, well, thanks for the story.
- You're welcome.

223
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,923
Gosh. Smashing.

224
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:42,090
Yeah, it is. 17 and 9.

225
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:45,792
That's all right. Have you heard
the inquest is fixed for tomorrow?

226
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:47,214
Inquest? Who's dead?

227
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,926
There's always an inquest
on treasure trove.

228
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:51,044
The coroner has to sort out
the different claims.

229
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:54,137
Oh, that shouldn't take him long.
After all, I found the stuff.

230
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,379
But there was certain others
instrumental, wasn't there?

231
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,049
- You've got to take that into account.
- How do you mean?

232
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:04,172
Well, er... if Benny here
hadn't set that wheel rolling...

233
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,924
Now, don't you try and come it over me.
You set it off. I saw you.

234
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:15,342
- You weren't there.
- Call your own father a liar, would you?

235
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:19,463
- OK, OK, I did it.
- Good boy.

236
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,460
Come on, Charlie boy.

237
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:25,087
You can tell me.
Mum won't be cross.

238
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:31,800
- Don't want a sweet.
- You'll have a sweet and like it!

239
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:37,462
So, you admit quite frankly
that the explosion of the bomb

240
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:41,463
was solely due to this thoughtless
action of yours and yours alone?

241
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,756
Yes, sir.

242
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,377
Well, well!

243
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,594
After nine years
as coroner of this district,

244
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:51,087
I find this a new
and most refreshing experience.

245
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,131
I congratulate the parents of Pimlico

246
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,924
on such a fine crop
of exceptionally honest youngsters.

247
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,381
That seems to dispose of the evidence
as to the finding of this treasure.

248
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,175
There remains one further important duty
before the court.

249
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:10,466
We must now establish
to whom it belongs.

250
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:14,463
I understand that the old parchments
provide valuable evidence on this point.

251
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,382
We will now hear
the translation of that document

252
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,504
from Professor Hatton-Jones
of London University.

253
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:26,921
Oh, I'm so sorry.

254
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:33,045
I understand
that Professor Hatton-Jones

255
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:36,250
has successfully established
the original ownership of this treasure.

256
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,547
Yes, indeed.

257
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:40,216
It belongs to the Duchy of Burgundy,

258
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,462
being vested in the person
of the Duke Charles...

259
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,006
Who, I believe, died in 1477?

260
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:50,961
If we are to believe Basin,
Reiffenburg, Gollut and Schmel.

261
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,586
In fact, according
to all the major historians,

262
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,177
he was killed at the Battle of Nancy.

263
00:19:56,292 --> 00:19:59,796
But with the aid
of this most exciting document,

264
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:02,591
I am now able to change
the course of history.

265
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,131
Would you mind explaining
your point more fully?

266
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,378
Picture a battlefield.

267
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:19,252
9,481 frozen corpses are all that
remains of Burgundy's pride.

268
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,753
The Duke himself lies slain among them.

269
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:27,382
This poor naked body,
robbed by harpies, bitten by wolves,

270
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,753
the visage battered beyond recognition,

271
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:34,301
this they accept as the last
earthly remains of Charles VII,

272
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:38,126
Duke of Burgundy,
last of the line of Charolais.

273
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,336
Do they judge correctly?

274
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,792
Is this indeed the cadaver
of Charles the Rash?

275
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:46,294
Ha-ha!

276
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:50,001
If so, then I am Joan of Arc.

277
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:54,634
I see.

278
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,924
Then it is your contention
that the historians were wrong,

279
00:20:58,042 --> 00:20:59,922
that the Duke of Burgundy
escaped with his life?

280
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,709
Yes! Charles the Rash lives on.

281
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:07,167
With the missing portion
of the Burgundian treasure,

282
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:09,920
he has fled to an unknown refuge.

283
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:15,344
Unknown for 500 years,
but known at last today!

284
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,719
Miramont House, Pimlico!

285
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,548
Now, it has always been known

286
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:31,716
that Miramont House was occupied
by a Burgundian nobleman

287
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,927
styling himself
the Count Maurice de Charolais.

288
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:38,377
With the help of this document,
I now intend to prove

289
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,673
that Maurice de Charolais
and the Duke of Burgundy

290
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:42,089
were one and the same person.

291
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:47,419
For it is a Royal Charter
signed by King Edward IV,

292
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:50,091
making the Duke
not only a grant of Miramont House,

293
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:54,543
but decreeing that the entire estate
shall be recognised henceforth

294
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:56,169
as Burgundian soil.

295
00:21:56,292 --> 00:21:58,636
Now, Edward IV
would never have made such a grant...

296
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,344
Er... excuse me, Professor.

297
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,802
Are you implying that this treasure
does not belong to the crown?

298
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:08,593
Oh, no, it belongs to the people
in the area covered by the old estate,

299
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:13,088
since this charter specifically
makes them natives of Burgundy.

300
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:16,052
Do you mean that these Londoners
are technically Burgundians?

301
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:20,718
Indubitably. This Royal Charter
has never been repealed.

302
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,801
It is as valid today

303
00:22:22,917 --> 00:22:26,376
as on the day it was signed
by the founder of the House of York.

304
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,505
Blimey. I'm a foreigner.

305
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:33,424
It would be difficult to exaggerate

306
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:37,547
the enormous importance
of this document...

307
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:54,049
- Looks like a fine weekend.
- Yes, sir.

308
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,881
You'll be back.

309
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:11,667
Miramont Place. Now, come on,
step lively, all you aliens.

310
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:15,422
- Belgrave Road?
- No, lady, we're going to England.

311
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,548
I'm sorry, sir, I wasn't expecting you.

312
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:32,673
Wix, it seems that my last visit here
failed to make any impression on you.

313
00:23:32,792 --> 00:23:34,840
Or am I mistaken?

314
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,920
Perhaps you did receive
Head Office sanction

315
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,636
to admit the press
to one of our strongrooms.

316
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,004
No, sir, but it...
it all happened so quickly, I...

317
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:46,719
You've answered my question.
That's enough.

318
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:49,552
I don't wish to pursue the matter.

319
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:51,715
I shall have to advise Head Office
to arrange for your transfer

320
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,210
to one of our country branches.

321
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:55,677
Transfer? Oh, no, sir.

322
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:58,341
L...l could never settle down
anywhere else.

323
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,460
This is my home.
I... I've lived here all my life.

324
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,631
I was born here.

325
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:05,631
In Burgundy.

326
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,798
You can't throw me out
of my own country.

327
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:11,501
Don't be absurd, man. If you seriously
think that an obscure part of the law...

328
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:14,469
Obscure or not, legally,
this is Burgundy.

329
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:17,382
Head Office no longer has
any jurisdiction over this bank.

330
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,085
This is my bank.

331
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,469
I reckon two pounds will cover this.

332
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:54,666
Hey, how many in your litter?
You need 40 ration books for that lot.

333
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:57,671
Ration books'? This is Burgundy.

334
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,423
Burgundy!

335
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:06,631
You still got that blouse?

336
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,924
- Fiddling coupons, then?
- Coupons? This is Burgundy.

337
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,377
Ah!

338
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,220
What do you want to queue for?
This is Burgundy!

339
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:26,123
Now, then, now then!
Five to two, Full Moon.

340
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:30,293
Now, come on. Who wants a bet? The oldest
firm in Burgundy. What's that, sir?

341
00:25:30,417 --> 00:25:34,752
Yes, your export department.
This is Burgundy.

342
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:37,173
Burgundy! Burgundy!

343
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:40,669
Drink up, Mr Wix.
Where's your patriotism?

344
00:25:40,792 --> 00:25:44,251
Sorry, but I've just been making
a rough estimate of our national assets.

345
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:48,255
Crowns and ducats
to the value of£18,200.

346
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:50,548
Pitchers, goblets and ewers
to the value of...

347
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:53,967
- What's ewers?
- Mine's a pint.

348
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:55,881
That's very good.

349
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,343
Anyway, I estimate the total

350
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:59,802
to be somewhere
in the neighbourhood of£100,000.

351
00:25:59,917 --> 00:26:02,261
Cor, that's about 1,000 nicker apiece,
ain't it?

352
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:05,379
- I'll send Charlie to Eton.
- I'm gonna have a saltwater aquarium.

353
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,672
Just a minute.

354
00:26:06,792 --> 00:26:10,046
I doubt whether individual claims can be
made to treasure vested in a community.

355
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:11,714
Oh, I knew there'd be a catch in it.

356
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:14,086
Whatever happens to the treasure,
that piece of land is ours.

357
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:15,710
I think I know what's coming.

358
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:18,382
Well, why not?
It's part of Burgundy now.

359
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,128
About time we gave the kids a break.
We can have a go tomorrow.

360
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,220
Let's turn the old static water tank
into a swimming pool, for a start.

361
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,710
Hear, hear!

362
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:30,293
- Here's to the Burgundy Lido!
- Hear, hear!

363
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:32,670
All very laudable, no doubt,
but where are your returns?

364
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:34,465
The real benefit to the community

365
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:37,086
would be some scheme
for stimulating local trade

366
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:39,506
- and launching new enterprises.
- That's what I say.

367
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:41,172
Time, ladies and gentlemen, please.

368
00:26:41,292 --> 00:26:44,751
Here, what do you mean, time?
Where do you think we are, in England?

369
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:49,132
No licensing laws here, my lad.
Isn't that so, Mr Garland?

370
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,969
Yeah, that's right.
We close when I say.

371
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:53,881
Not even a music license?

372
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:57,261
You heard what the gentleman said.

373
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:15,381
- He's better than Hutch.
- Much.

374
00:27:31,292 --> 00:27:33,090
Oh, Mr Hu...

375
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:58,751
- How about a breath of fresh air?
- I think it's a bit too hot for walking.

376
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:02,129
<i>I</i> I don't want to set the world

381
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:31,254
Not bad, that boy of yours.
He'd be worth 20 quid a week to you.

382
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:33,594
- Yeah, I'll put him up a dollar.
- Hark at him.

383
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:37,588
A dollar rise for the poor little perisher.
Skin a maggot, you would.

384
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:40,882
- You keep a civil tongue in your head!
- Now, then! Now, then, now, then!

385
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,174
- What's going on here?
- Nothing you can do about it, cock!

386
00:28:44,292 --> 00:28:46,761
That's right. You've said it right.

387
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:50,175
You're in a foreign country now, Ted.
Drink when you like.

388
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:56,465
Right. Mine's a pint.

389
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:03,760
Spiller!

390
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,628
Clear this place.
Go home, all you people.

391
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:10,131
You're suspended from duty.

392
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:15,587
Right, I'll have another pint.

393
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:19,136
I'm going to take proceedings
against you, Mr Garland.

394
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,673
Your identity card, please.

395
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,844
Passing of betting slips
strictly prohibited.

396
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:35,335
Come to think of it,
I shan't need this any more either.

397
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,004
That's the stuff. Scrap 'em all.

398
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:42,878
Stop it! Stop it, you idiots!

399
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,094
Mr Wix, you're a responsible man.
Can't you do something?

400
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:47,006
Certainly.

401
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:51,376
- This is a job for Scotland Yard.
- Whitehall 1212.

402
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,050
<i>J</i> Knees up, Mother Brown
Knees up, Mother Brown

I Knees up, knees up, get those
knees up, knees up, Mother Brown...

404
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:01,802
'...question of Pimlico. No.'
 'The Minister's out of town.'

405
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:02,964
'Hello?'
 'Pimlico.'

406
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:05,403
'Put this call through
to the Home Office, please.'

407
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:06,630
'Yes, Pimlico.'
 'No, Burgundy.'

408
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,048
'Pimlico.'
 'Clear the line. Priority call.'

409
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:15,552
Back again, sir?

410
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:27,674
Mr Straker of the Foreign Office.

411
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,878
- Have you been here all night?
- Hm.

412
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,549
- What's this Pimlico stuff?
- Top priority.

413
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,967
- The old man wants immediate action.
- Well, what are you gonna do?

414
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:41,506
Well, I thought that as the treasure
was originally spoils of battle,

415
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:44,708
- I'd pass it on to the War Office.
- Oh, they wouldn't touch it.

416
00:30:45,917 --> 00:30:49,296
You see, technically,
these Burgundians are aliens.

417
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:51,966
Aliens? Well, then, it's your pigeon.

418
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,802
No, no, they're undesirable aliens
so it's your pigeon.

419
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:56,794
I suppose you'll have to boot them
out of the country.

420
00:30:56,917 --> 00:30:59,386
Yes, but it's their own country.

421
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:14,219
- There's your ten, Dad.
- All right.

422
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,220
Black market eggs!
Black market butter!

423
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:29,335
Lovely black market butter!

424
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:34,464
Come on, ladies!
Give the old man a treat! It's lovely!

425
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:37,837
All the grub you want
for a pre-war breakfast!

426
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:42,091
Nylons! Genuine stolen nylons!

427
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:44,961
Guinea a pair! Fully fashioned!

428
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:48,087
Get these lovely nylons!

429
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:53,886
Come on, ladies!

430
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,503
Turn it up! I'm coming!

431
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:05,876
- Good morning, Mrs Randall.
- You gone barmy? It's Sunday.

432
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,504
Special delivery.
Two dozen boxes export silks.

433
00:32:10,917 --> 00:32:13,511
That's right. Come on, let's have 'em.

434
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:21,921
Black market bacon!
Off the ration!

435
00:32:22,042 --> 00:32:26,843
Hey, off the ration! Black market bacon!
Come and get your bacon!

436
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,094
- Mind your back, Ma.
- Hey, no parking here!

437
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:48,926
Who says so?

438
00:32:49,042 --> 00:32:51,090
- Hi, you, get moving.
- Get out of it.

439
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:53,757
- Oh, it's like that, is it?
- Go on, you silly old slob.

440
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:56,924
- Hawker's license.
- You want to make something of it?

441
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:59,170
- Go on, sock him one, Harry.
- We'll see about that.

442
00:32:59,292 --> 00:33:01,135
It's no use, Ted.
They've all read the papers.

443
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,877
Here comes Mr Pemberton.

444
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:09,672
Go on, get out of it!
We're gonna start digging here.

445
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,343
What's going on?

446
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:25,337
Looks to me like the annual outing
from Dartmoor.

447
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:27,938
Ah, don't worry. I'm seeing to it.
Just going to ring the nick.

448
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,709
- Ah, the Chief Constable of Burgundy.
- Sir, about last night...

449
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,676
You'd better get yourself a new uniform.

450
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:41,045
This area is out of bounds
to the Metropolitan Police.

451
00:33:41,167 --> 00:33:43,386
- What?
- Yes, Mr Pemberton.

452
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,460
Home Office has just confirmed what
you were all shouting about last night.

453
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,377
It was a bit of nonsense.
We'd all had a few.

454
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,423
Yes, and Whitehall's got the headache.

455
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,590
And until they can decide
which department is responsible,

456
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:54,426
our orders are to keep out of Burgundy.

457
00:33:54,542 --> 00:33:57,136
And in the meantime, I suppose, nobody
cares if we all get our throats cut?

458
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,797
I'm sorry,
I'm just telling you the position.

459
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:00,419
Oh, we're not having that.

460
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:03,671
We've all paid our rates.
We're entitled to police protection.

461
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:10,256
Gregg. Who?

462
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:12,548
Pemberton of Pimlico.

463
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:16,092
No, sir, no. Nobody can help you
unless you have delegatory powers.

464
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:18,552
Delegatory powers? H m -

465
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:22,547
All right. But in plain English, I'm
speaking for all of us who live here.

466
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:25,546
But, my dear sir,
from the Home Office point of view,

467
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:27,795
you remain an anomalous
collection of individuals

468
00:34:27,917 --> 00:34:30,887
unless you form
a representative committee.

469
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,094
What? Oh, yes.

470
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:37,759
Oh, certainly. Oh, then... then
it's a matter for the Foreign Office.

471
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:44,463
They won't talk to us till we form
a representative committee.

472
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:48,338
All right, let's call a general meeting
and elect one right away.

473
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,843
<i>Ho“.!</i>

474
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,753
45 shillings. I'll take two pounds
if you can do with it.

475
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:20,958
Over there. Two pounds for
the eiderdown. Ladies and gentlemen.

476
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:24,508
Mr Wix. We're having a meeting.

477
00:35:46,917 --> 00:35:50,217
Shut up.

478
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:52,301
Me on the committee?

479
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:54,715
I said they might want to elect you.
Who knows?

480
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:57,677
Edie Randall, MP for Burgundy.

481
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:03,423
They're all jelly!
All jelly! Jellied eels!

482
00:36:03,542 --> 00:36:05,715
Two bob and pick where you like!
Lovely lot of jellied eels!

483
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:08,427
Jellied eels, they're champion!

484
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:10,636
Thank you, sir.

485
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:13,344
- Oi, manners, you!
- These ain't Danish eels.

486
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:16,337
- What, do you think I'd cheat the public?
- I know an Irish eel when I see it.

487
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:19,007
OK, have me arrested.

488
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:22,299
All right, laugh while you can. We'll
soon have you twisters out of here.

489
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:24,294
Yeah? What with? Your air force?

490
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,128
Fancy! Start a new country
when they don't know how to protect it.

491
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:52,208
'Reports that
rationed articles and export goods

492
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:55,132

- Right.

503
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,674
That settles it.

504
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:34,591
Mrs Randall, Mr Spiller and yours truly.

505
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:41,335
Now I'd better ring up Whitehall
right away.

506
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:43,711
What's that? What's going on?

507
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:46,677
They're gonna sell out,
gonna give the place back to England.

508
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:49,386
Mr Pemberton, just a minute.

509
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,049
If you hand Burgundy back,
they'll claim our treasure with it.

510
00:37:52,167 --> 00:37:53,760
Oh, we can come to terms about that.

511
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:55,923
The important thing
is to get law and order here.

512
00:37:56,042 --> 00:37:59,797
Can't have the place turned into a spiv's paradise.
Hello, Mr Straker, please.

513
00:37:59,917 --> 00:38:03,046
What about us business people?
This is our big chance, ain't it?

514
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:05,716
- Hear, hear!
- I'm in business too, aren't I?

515
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:08,586
That doesn't mean I want
to be murdered in my bed.

516
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:12,631
Shh. Shh, quiet!

517
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:17,210
Hello? Er... Mr Straker?
My name is Arthur Pemberton.

518
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:18,505
L...I'd like to report that

519
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:21,549
we have now a formed a representative
committee of the people of Burgundy.

520
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:23,965
I see.

521
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:27,053
Yes. Oh, yes, yes,
I am in touch with Mr Gregg.

522
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:30,671
But a rather abstruse
constitutional issue has now arisen,

523
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:33,716
and I'm afraid we shall have to pass
it on to the Law Offices Department.

524
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:38,760
Now, see here, sir. For all we know, that
might take weeks. All right, months.

525
00:38:38,875 --> 00:38:41,344
Hello? Hello?

526
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:43,631
Ah, can you beat that?

527
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,673
First of all, they say
we must have a committee.

528
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:47,794
Now they say it can only be
officially recognised

529
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:51,547
if appointed in accordance with
the electoral laws of ancient Burgundy.

530
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:53,795
Well, that seems to settle things.

531
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:56,261
Unless, of course, somebody present
happens to be familiar

532
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,377
with the electoral laws
of ancient Burgundy.

533
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,379
But certainly.

534
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,094
It was the custom
for the Duke of Burgundy himself

535
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,631
to elect a council of two sheriffs,
one burgess,

536
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,593
and one hoof man
or captain of the guard.

537
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:10,005
Who might you be?

538
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:12,219
My name is Sebastien de Charolais,

539
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:14,711
and I come from Dijon,
capital of ancient Burgundy.

540
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:18,337
Mm. Only the Duke himself
can appoint a council,

541
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:20,051
and <i>as</i> there is no such person...

542
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:25,048
Oh, but you're wrong. There is
such person. I am the Duke of Burgundy.

543
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:26,669
No!

544
00:39:26,792 --> 00:39:30,467
I am the direct descendant of Maurice
de Charolais, who came here in 1477.

545
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:35,259
Therefore I am the heir to the title.
I hope you don't mind.

546
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:39,881
Oh, no, no. I mean, well... l mean,
well, it's a bit of a turn-up, isn't it?

547
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,631
Here is my evidence. These documents
have been in my family for centuries.

548
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:49,460
I have always thought they were
of no value, just an amusing curiosity.

549
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:52,757
But when I read about your discovery,
I said to myself...

550
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:56,881
Yes, I bet you did.

551
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,927
Hm. Of course,
you want them to be examined.

552
00:40:01,042 --> 00:40:02,885
Oh, indubitably.

553
00:40:08,875 --> 00:40:10,923
Hello, Pemberton's?

554
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:13,090
Oh, yes.

555
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:17,793
What, can't he eat anything? Oh, poor
little fellow. Must be this heat.

556
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:20,511
Yes, all right.
I'll have something for him.

557
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:23,879
Send him round the back door, will you?
Thank you. Goodbye.

558
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,718
Mrs Wilson.

559
00:40:26,542 --> 00:40:27,668
Sorry, folks.

560
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,465
Well, there seems
nothing more to be done

561
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:31,424
until this gentleman's claims
are investigated.

562
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:33,677
So, all we can do
is to adjourn the meeting.

563
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,136
- Hear, hear!
-  Hear, hear!

564
00:40:40,542 --> 00:40:43,546
- I am afraid I am a great nuisance.
- No, no, no. Not at all.

565
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:47,171
- You may be the very man we want.
- I hope so.

566
00:40:47,292 --> 00:40:49,420
<i>Au revoir, madame.</i>

567
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:51,926
<i>Au revoir.</i>

568
00:40:52,042 --> 00:40:55,376
Mademoiselle, it occurs to me that I ought
to know something about my dukedom.

569
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,379
Would you care to show me
a little of this new Burgundy?

570
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,502
Well, I could do
with a breath of fresh air.

571
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,923
Alors, we go.

572
00:41:03,042 --> 00:41:04,885
So gay and exciting.

573
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,970
So different
from our dreary French towns.

574
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:16,297
J I just want to start
a little flame in your heart

575
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:24,511
<i>J</i> In my heart I have but one desire...

576
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:30,381
Professor Hatton-Jones?

577
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,754
Oh. Yes, it is, very urgent.

578
00:41:35,042 --> 00:41:36,715
When?

579
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:39,919
Oh.

580
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:42,670
No, all right.
I'll ring again in the morning.

581
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,379
'Today,
after reading in the Sunday papers,

582

- Thank you. Pour it in, please.

You know, your England
is a most remarkable nation.

Everywhere else, governments
command, scream, shout,

politely to stay away and they do.

Ha-ha-ha!

602
00:43:20,792 --> 00:43:24,001

Come in!

Good morning, sir.
I hope you'll pardon us for...

606
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,502
I am the culprit.

of the London University.

608

The moment our good friend told me
the news, I was Arion, I was Zephyrus!

609
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:46,382
Nothing could detain me
from instant communion

610
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,174
with the living survivor
of the House of Charolais!

611
00:43:49,292 --> 00:43:51,545
Er... you have examined my documents?

612
00:43:51,667 --> 00:43:53,761
Oh, a cursory glance.

613
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:58,085
Personally, I have no doubt at all
as to the question of your lineage.

614
00:43:58,208 --> 00:43:59,881
Forgive me, are you a bleeder?

615
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,755
- I beg your pardon?
- Do you suffer from haemophilia?

616
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:08,676
When you cut yourself,
do you bleed interminably?

617
00:44:08,792 --> 00:44:11,921
- No, I don't think so.
- Ah, a pity.

618
00:44:12,042 --> 00:44:14,591
It's in the family.
Definitely in the family.

619
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:16,551
Oh, I am very sorry.

620
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:19,667
- I don't want to hurry you, Professor, but...
- Oh, quite, quite! Ha-ha-ha!

621
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:23,004
I mustn't embark on family matters
or I'll be here all day.

622
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:25,594
I have to take these off
for a sulphate reaction test.

623
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:27,802
I'll soon be back, though.
Depend on that.

624
00:44:27,917 --> 00:44:32,593
Now that I know you're truly extant,
I go away satisfied.

625
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:35,211
Ha-ha! What Gollut would give
to be in my shoes!

626
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:38,883
Ha! I could even put
Schmel in the shade!

627
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:47,635
How long is this chemical test
going to take?

628
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:51,380
- That's contingent on certain factors.
- Please hurry it up.

629
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,174
If things go on like this much longer...

630
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,798
What's happened now?
They're packing up.

631
00:44:57,917 --> 00:45:00,761
- What does this mean?
- I don't know.

632
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,730
You'll have to take
your place in the queue, madam.

633
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:09,337
What's the idea holding us up like this?
I got my dinner to cook.

634
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,968
Ah, look at that.

635
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:27,835
- Action at last.
- Yes.

636
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:30,006
That'll keep the spivs out.

637
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:32,002
Oh, er... Mr Pemberton.

638
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:34,594
- Ah.
- Mr Pemberton.

639
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:37,052
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

640
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:40,797
This is Mr Bagshawe of the, er...
Board of Customs & Excise.

641
00:45:40,917 --> 00:45:42,518
He'd like to have a
word with you people.

642
00:45:42,542 --> 00:45:45,386
There are just a few things
I would like to explain.

643
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,094
- If I might step over your frontier.
- By all means.

644
00:45:48,208 --> 00:45:51,257
I must congratulate you
on the speed with which you have...

645
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:54,675
Oh, excuse me, Professor. This looks
like the solution to all our troubles.

646
00:45:54,792 --> 00:45:56,794
This way.

647
00:45:58,417 --> 00:46:00,511
In the line, please, madam.

648
00:46:08,458 --> 00:46:09,960
Have you anything to declare, madam?

649
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:12,757
Any food stuff, livestock,
linen or cotton goods?

650
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:16,675
I hardly think this is likely to include
the credentials of the Duke of Burgundy.

651
00:46:16,792 --> 00:46:20,592
Would you mind
opening that case, madam?

652
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:25,760
This really is a big relief to us, I can tell you.
It's a very very clever bit of...

653
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:29,709
- No, no, I think you're wrong.
- What's all that in aid of?

654
00:46:32,667 --> 00:46:35,067
- But we tore 'em up, I tell you!
- You let him have it, Dad!

655
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,885
That's where we live, right there.

656
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,674
It's merely part
of the Customs procedure.

657
00:46:39,792 --> 00:46:42,170
We naturally have to enforce
the immigration laws.

658
00:46:42,292 --> 00:46:44,386
You can't have the one
without the other.

659
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,502
Yes, but...

660
00:46:46,625 --> 00:46:49,959
Frederick Albert Cowan Esquire. That's
me. Number four, Miramont Gardens.

661
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:51,300
I am sorry, sir.

662
00:46:51,417 --> 00:46:54,216
The order specifies
that identity cards must be produced

663
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:57,507
by residents who wish
to re-enter the street.

664
00:46:57,625 --> 00:46:59,878
Do you mean to say that
all of us who live in this street

665
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,004
have got to go through that rigmarole
every time we want to leave our homes?

666
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:05,093
Oh, for a month or two.

667
00:47:05,208 --> 00:47:06,888
After all,
pending a new Act of Parliament,

668
00:47:06,917 --> 00:47:08,794
this is technically foreign territory.

669
00:47:08,917 --> 00:47:10,544
Ha-ha-ha! Foreign territory!

670
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:11,759
I suppose that means

671
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:13,502
British subjects won't be allowed
to spend any money here.

672
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:14,785
What about all our customers?

673
00:47:14,792 --> 00:47:16,169
You can't stop us earning
an honest living.

674
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:18,093
I've never heard
such a lot of rot in my life.

675
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:19,710
Don't blame me, ladies and gentlemen.

676
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:22,507
Edward lV's the one
who made you foreigners.

677
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:23,751
Here we go again!

678
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:25,877
- You people make me tired.
- Order, order!

679
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,298
Oh, shut up. Did you ever
hear such tripe in your life?

680
00:47:28,417 --> 00:47:30,169
- Now look here, sir!
- And you shut up too.

681
00:47:30,292 --> 00:47:34,251
All right, if that's the way Whitehall
want it, in future, we'll be foreigners.

682
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:35,752
That's the stuff, Dad.

683
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:39,379
We'll fight them in the tramlines,
we'll fight them in the local.

684
00:48:04,042 --> 00:48:06,170
Good evening, Professor.

685
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:07,760
Oh, good evening.

686
00:48:07,875 --> 00:48:11,084
Your friends in Miramont Place
have got themselves into a nice mess.

687
00:48:11,208 --> 00:48:14,792
Poor souls.
The innocent victims of destiny.

688
00:48:14,917 --> 00:48:16,294
They started all this nonsense.

689
00:48:16,417 --> 00:48:17,919
Now they've got to put up
with the consequences.

690
00:48:18,042 --> 00:48:22,377
Ah, but will they?
The Burgundians are a fighting people.

691
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,049
Consider what they did
against the might of Louis XI.

692
00:48:25,167 --> 00:48:28,296
I fail to see what this little mob
can do against the might of Britain.

693
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:33,504
Oh! Get up, please.

694
00:48:33,625 --> 00:48:36,549
All passports. Passports ready, please.

695
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:38,465
All hand luggage open, please.

696
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:40,927
Time to make
your currency declarations, please.

697
00:48:41,042 --> 00:48:42,635
What the devil does this mean?

698
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,752
The train is now
at the Burgundian frontier.

699
00:48:44,875 --> 00:48:47,128
A fighting people, Mr Bassett.

700
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:50,959
Worthy successors
of the Knights of the Golden Fleece.

701
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:52,756
Have you anything to declare, madam?

702
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:55,344
Any food stuff, livestock,
linen or cotton goods?

703
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:56,505
No.

704
00:48:56,625 --> 00:48:58,423
Any muskrats,
mealworms, motorcycles,

705
00:48:58,542 --> 00:49:01,011
hashish, prepared opium
or agricultural machinery?

706
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:02,627
Oh!

707
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:09,759
Have you any foreign currency?
English pounds? Traveller's cheques?

708
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:13,334
- Suppose I have?
- I just wondered.

709
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,470
No passage beyond this point
without passports. All passports.

710
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:20,585
- Here is mine.
- Hm?

711
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:25,628
What is it you... you... Baratooshe,

712
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,502
er... Baratooshe,

713
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:31,004
er... Baratooshe... United Kingdom!

714
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:48,552
England, United Kingdom!

715
00:49:49,792 --> 00:49:54,252
All hand luggage ready for inspection,
please. Anything to declare?

716
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:57,379
Anything to declare, sir? Any livestock,
foodstuff, linen or cotton goods?

717
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,127
Rather!

718
00:50:08,917 --> 00:50:12,171
Come along.
Come along, please.

719
00:50:12,292 --> 00:50:16,126
All ready with your passports.
Get your passports out.

720
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,799
So reminds me of the time
I visited the catacombs.

721
00:50:18,917 --> 00:50:21,045
Mr Pemberton, this is preposterous.

722
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:22,760
Sorry, Mr Bassett.
We're a foreign country now.

723
00:50:22,875 --> 00:50:25,424
We can't allow tourists
without the usual formalities.

724
00:50:25,542 --> 00:50:26,794
Come along, sir, please.

725
00:50:26,917 --> 00:50:29,090
- Pass down the track.
- The Duke!

726
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:33,008
- Oh, madam, is it proved?
- Beyond a title of a doubt.

727
00:50:33,125 --> 00:50:36,334
Yes, gentlemen, you see before you
the 18th Duke of Burgundy.

728
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:38,927
Your liege lord, your sovereign!

729
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,423
Floreat Burgundia!

730
00:50:49,542 --> 00:50:52,842
Stop that train!

731
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:38,545
What are we going to tell the old man?

732
00:51:38,667 --> 00:51:40,214
Well, after this underground business,

733
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:43,212
I doubt if he will give us
a chance to open our mouths.

734
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:45,176
Soap.

735
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,172
Were you issued with this?

736
00:51:48,292 --> 00:51:50,090
No, I pinched it
from the French Embassy.

737
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:52,051
Oh. Ha-ha.

738
00:51:52,167 --> 00:51:55,922
This situation, though,
it's an absolute deadlock.

739
00:51:56,042 --> 00:51:57,715
Oh, no, not quite.

740
00:51:57,833 --> 00:52:01,042
Now that this Duke
has been officially recognised,

741
00:52:01,167 --> 00:52:02,794
we can at least talk to them.

742
00:52:02,917 --> 00:52:04,590
- Towel?
- The time for talk's past.

743
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:07,382
Any more talk and we've had it.
We've got to do something.

744
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,093
We've got to tell this Duke
where he gets off.

745
00:52:09,208 --> 00:52:12,132
Oh, well, I hope the old man
won't put me on to it.

746
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:15,379
After all, this fellow's been made
a sort of king in a way.

747
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,754
Yes. Probably having his coronation
at this very moment.

748
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:23,425
Well, why don't you loosen your tie,
Your Grace?

749
00:52:23,542 --> 00:52:27,718
- I thought you'd be used to the heat.
- Well, it's never <i>as</i> bad <i>as</i> that in Dijon.

750
00:52:27,833 --> 00:52:30,757
All the same, I bet you'd rather
be there than couped up here.

751
00:52:30,875 --> 00:52:33,469
Why do you think it
so much nicer than Pimlico?

752
00:52:35,125 --> 00:52:37,298
I imagine it's a little more romantic.

753
00:52:37,417 --> 00:52:42,594
Oh, do you? What do you think
we would be doing in Dijon this evening?

754
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:46,219
Well, we... we'd eat in the open

755
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:50,588
and dance in the main square
under the trees.

756
00:52:51,792 --> 00:52:54,762
Then maybe we'd go for a little walk

757
00:52:54,875 --> 00:52:59,130
up one of those funny old
cobbled streets to the castle

758
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:03,667
and when we reach the orange grove...

759
00:53:03,792 --> 00:53:07,126
we'd sit beneath the castle wall

760
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:10,343
and watch the dawn come up.

761
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:14,338
And, er...
in the cool morning breeze,

762
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:18,088
maybe I would put my coat
around your shoulders

763
00:53:18,208 --> 00:53:20,256
and...

764
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:26,923
<i>Hm.</i>

765
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:31,254
Well, anyway,
I'm afraid Dijon is not a bit like that.

766
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:34,629
We cannot dance in the main square because
of the trams which run all night,

767
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:38,004
and, er... we cannot grow oranges
because it's too cold,

768
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:41,880
and, er... where the castle was,
well, today there is a cement factory.

769
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,968
Then it's just about <i>as</i> romantic
as Camden Town.

770
00:53:44,083 --> 00:53:46,677
Ah, but the people,
they make it different.

771
00:53:46,792 --> 00:53:50,968
You should see us at the vendange,
the, er... the wine harvest,

772
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:53,177
when all over the country,
the peasants celebrate.

773
00:53:53,292 --> 00:53:58,298
And they are gay,
not... not drunk but very, very gay.

774
00:53:58,417 --> 00:54:02,172
And, er... well, I suppose
we would walk in the moonlight,

775
00:54:02,292 --> 00:54:04,386
through the sloping vineyards,

776
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:09,677
and we would come to an old Roman
ruin called the Temple d'Amour,

777
00:54:09,792 --> 00:54:12,466
- Hm?
- The Temple of Love.

778
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:17,551
I see. And there the walk ends
and I succumb to your gallant charm.

779
00:54:17,667 --> 00:54:21,376
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Because my
intentions, they are most honourable.

780
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:27,553
I would talk to you about my job
at the hotel, my income, my prospects,

781
00:54:27,667 --> 00:54:31,126
- No funny business at all?
- Absolutely none.

782
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,128
- No'?
- No.

783
00:54:41,792 --> 00:54:43,544
Let's go in.

784
00:54:52,833 --> 00:54:56,042
Hi, you two! Hullo there!

785
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:59,671
- What is it, Dad?
- Gentleman here to see the Duke!

786
00:54:59,792 --> 00:55:01,260
Oh.

787
00:55:02,417 --> 00:55:03,634
Well, I'm really glad.

788
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:06,469
Course, I always knew you people would
have to recognise us sooner or later.

789
00:55:06,583 --> 00:55:09,052
- Ah, here is the Duke.
- Ah, Your Excellency.

790
00:55:09,167 --> 00:55:11,590
Allow me to present my credentials.

791
00:55:13,667 --> 00:55:17,046
But I'm not the ruler now.
No, they've asked me to form a cabinet.

792
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:20,341
- <i>Oh, long live democracy!</i>
- <i>Vive l'Angleterre!</i>

793
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:23,177
<i>- Vive la France!
- What next'?</i>

794
00:55:23,292 --> 00:55:27,126
Well, you will understand that after
today's incident on the underground,

795
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:30,299
His Majesty's Government
does not feel inclined to negotiate

796
00:55:30,417 --> 00:55:31,457
with a pistol at its head.

797
00:55:31,542 --> 00:55:34,170
Now that we've come down to <i>brass</i>
tacks, I can guarantee there'll be no...

798
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:38,172
His Majesty's Government has a traditional
dislike of unilateral guarantees.

799
00:55:38,292 --> 00:55:41,171
It has therefore felt itself compelled,
most reluctantly,

800
00:55:41,292 --> 00:55:43,545
to close the frontier
as from 10AM tomorrow.

801
00:55:43,667 --> 00:55:45,635
- Close the frontier?
- What about us?

802
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:48,674
A church hall has been equipped
for the evacuation of all those who...

803
00:55:48,792 --> 00:55:50,044
- Church hall?
- Evacuation?

804
00:55:50,167 --> 00:55:51,589
What about our treasure?

805
00:55:51,708 --> 00:55:55,087
Well, for the time being, that can be
moved to the Bank of England.

806
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:58,178
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm not moving anyway.

807
00:55:58,292 --> 00:55:59,339
I beg your pardon?

808
00:55:59,458 --> 00:56:01,460
If the Nazis couldn't
drive me out of my home

809
00:56:01,583 --> 00:56:03,881
with all their bombs
and rockets and doodlebugs,

810
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,547
you don't catch me packing up now!

811
00:56:05,667 --> 00:56:07,886
Hear, hear!

812
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,753
I trust you realise that
the alternative is complete isolation?

813
00:56:10,875 --> 00:56:11,967
Power politics, eh?

814
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:14,302
I have merely explained the position.
I cannot do more.

815
00:56:14,417 --> 00:56:16,511
I do hope that moderation will prevail.

816
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:18,798
Moderation? He's an optimist.

817
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:21,796
You're barmy, the lot of you.
We've had a good run and this is it.

818
00:56:21,917 --> 00:56:24,420
That's OK, Jim. If you want to turn
it in, nobody is going to stop you.

819
00:56:24,542 --> 00:56:26,062
But we're not going to stand for that.

820
00:56:26,125 --> 00:56:28,503
You can't push English people around
like sacks of potatoes.

821
00:56:28,625 --> 00:56:29,968
English?

822
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:31,644
Don't you come that stuff, Jim Garland.

823
00:56:31,667 --> 00:56:34,295
We always were English
and we always will be English.

824
00:56:34,417 --> 00:56:35,714
And it's just because we are English

825
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:38,382
that we're sticking out
for our right to be Burgundians.

826
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,969
Hear, hear!

827
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:45,506

your boats now all right.

Ha-ha! I have?
You haven't done so bad yourself.

830
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:00,506
Worried?

831

No, never felt less worried in my life.

01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,093
'Mr Arthur Pemberton.'

911
01:02:36,208 --> 01:02:38,882
Er... yes, well, I'm happy to say that

912
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,594
after early opposition
from the Pimlico Council,

913
01:02:41,708 --> 01:02:45,133
my long-cherished scheme
for an open-air swimming pool

914
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:49,130
is now going ahead with the full
approval of the Burgundy Council.

915
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:52,174
'And so the glory
of the resurrected State of Burgundy

916
01:02:52,292 --> 01:02:54,386
'rises like a phoenix from the ash cans.

917
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:57,174
'But although this idea
was popular in the model stage,

918
01:02:57,292 --> 01:02:58,760
'the lunch whistle sounds a louder
message

919
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:01,094
'than hitting the production target.

920
01:03:02,708 --> 01:03:04,961
'Like all other public
works in Burgundy,

921
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:08,713
'this scheme is the result of a scientific
democratic analysis of public opinion.

922
01:03:18,208 --> 01:03:20,802
'The great drought caused
by London's longest heat wave

923
01:03:20,917 --> 01:03:24,967
'is the one serious threat
to Burgundy's independence.

924
01:03:25,083 --> 01:03:28,087
'80-year-old records for lack of
rainfall have all gone overboard.

925
01:03:28,208 --> 01:03:30,256
'Water is cut off, but liquor makes do.

926
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:34,960
'So, Burgundy washes up in a pint of bitter,
and makes tea with a kettle of boiling gin.

927
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:38,883
'In fact, Burgundians are spending
their water like money.

928
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:43,048
'So, this strangest of all sieges
continues,

929
01:03:43,167 --> 01:03:46,592
'a matter of principle to the
Burgundians, a headache to Whitehall.

930
01:03:46,708 --> 01:03:49,131
'But wherever our sympathies may lie
in this cold war in the heat wave,

931
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:51,969
'whatever the rights and wrongs
of the case,

932
01:03:52,083 --> 01:03:55,542
'one cannot but say,
"Plucky little Burgundy!"'

933
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:59,381
Yippee! Yippee!

934
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:02,128
That's my mum, that is, on the council!

935
01:04:05,125 --> 01:04:07,002
On the Council of Burgundy!

936
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:10,675
Come here!
Come here, Monty! Come here!

937
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,468
Hey!

938
01:04:42,458 --> 01:04:45,632
- Any news?
- I've no statement to make.

939
01:04:49,417 --> 01:04:51,886
There are exactly two gallons,
three quarts,

940
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,050
and one and one eighth pints of water
left in the whole of Burgundy.

941
01:04:57,208 --> 01:05:00,007
Well, I move we pass
a law against washing.

942
01:05:00,125 --> 01:05:02,378
- What, in this kind of weather?
- Really?

943
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:06,676
You keep quiet, my girl.
You're not even on this committee.

944
01:05:08,583 --> 01:05:11,132
Well, there it is.

945
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:13,628
We must either get water, or else.

946
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:18,802
Hey, we might make a sortie.
Like my ancestor at the siege of Dijon.

947
01:05:18,917 --> 01:05:21,215
The amount of water
we could carry back...

948
01:05:21,333 --> 01:05:23,210
Why don't you use your common sense?

949
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:26,712
They've turned off the hydrant
at the corner, haven't they?

950
01:05:26,833 --> 01:05:29,131
Well, go and turn it on again.

951
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:36,800
How many more weeks are we
going to walk round this barbed wire?

952
01:05:36,917 --> 01:05:38,294
Search me!

953
01:05:38,417 --> 01:05:42,001
What do they think this Burgundy mob's
gonna do'? Invade England?

954
01:05:42,125 --> 01:05:44,719
- Oh, good evening, officer.
- Good evening, sir.

955
01:05:44,833 --> 01:05:47,962
Oh, it's so hot, one cannot sleep.

956
01:05:48,083 --> 01:05:51,542
You know, it reminds me of a very,
very hot night on the Riviera,

957
01:05:51,667 --> 01:05:56,252
and there was a lovely brunette
and a beautiful blonde.

958
01:05:56,375 --> 01:05:58,423
I'd have laid an even monkey
there'd be moonlight.

959
01:05:58,542 --> 01:06:01,921
- Just our luck.
- Now, quiet as you can, everyone.

960
01:06:04,917 --> 01:06:08,547
But it must be terrible for you,
officer, wearing that thick uniform.

961
01:06:08,667 --> 01:06:09,748
Oh, that's all right, miss.

962
01:06:12,792 --> 01:06:14,920
Good luck, Ted.

963
01:06:34,833 --> 01:06:37,427
And lovely eyes.

964
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:59,753
- What was that?
- I didn't hear anything.

965
01:06:59,875 --> 01:07:02,344
Must have been cats or something.
Do you like cats, officer?

966
01:07:25,917 --> 01:07:29,467
I don't care.
You're not going to do your pools now.

967
01:07:37,292 --> 01:07:40,717
- Where do you think you're going?
- You're drunk. Drunk in charge!

968
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:45,587
Quite right, officer. I'll come quietly.

969
01:07:48,083 --> 01:07:52,008
No, I don't want to be too hard on you.
Be more careful in future.

970
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,334
Hey! Hey! I say!

971
01:08:38,458 --> 01:08:40,711
Go on, beat it!

972
01:08:42,292 --> 01:08:44,215
Will you go away?

973
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:47,878
- Why don't you arrest me?
- Oh, go on, go away!

974
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,298
Well, why don't you arrest me?
This is a free country, isn't it?

975
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:54,547
Hey! Will you go away?
Look, haven't you got a home?

976
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,468
Blimey. Copper.

977
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:26,344
I've had the police after me!

978
01:09:55,917 --> 01:09:58,215
Oh, it's good.

979
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:18,218
Taken 'em longer than I expected.

980
01:10:18,333 --> 01:10:21,007
Look, they're taking no more chances.

981
01:10:21,125 --> 01:10:24,129
Jackson, to the right. Round up there.

982
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:27,754
Who cares? Last us a month,
this little lot alone.

983
01:10:29,167 --> 01:10:31,545
- Mr Pemberton!
- Dad, come quick!

984
01:10:31,667 --> 01:10:33,669
- Would you come to the pub at once?
- What's up?

985
01:10:33,792 --> 01:10:36,545
Molly tried to wash her hands
when... when there was no water.

986
01:10:36,667 --> 01:10:39,511
- She left the tap turned on in the bar!
- Strewth!

987
01:11:01,917 --> 01:11:03,669
Well, it wasn't my fault.

988
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:07,296
I didn't know you were gonna
turn the water on again.

989
01:11:07,417 --> 01:11:10,421
Nobody ever tells me anything!

990
01:11:10,542 --> 01:11:13,512
It's all right, Moll.
It's no use crying over spilt milk.

991
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,877
Smith's Crisps!

992
01:11:19,792 --> 01:11:22,420
Four tins, that's all that's left.

993
01:11:22,542 --> 01:11:25,421
Everything else has had it.

994
01:11:25,542 --> 01:11:28,216
I reckon we've all had it this time.

995
01:11:39,083 --> 01:11:40,960
Well, we can't let them starve to death.

996
01:11:41,083 --> 01:11:43,927
We can't not let them starve to death.

997
01:11:44,042 --> 01:11:46,636
I wish we could pass it on to UNO.

998
01:11:49,292 --> 01:11:51,420
Well, why not?

999
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:56,630
Maudie, can you get me a line
to Lake Success?

1000
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:59,003
Yes, Success.

1001
01:12:03,667 --> 01:12:07,752
Hello?
Yes, sir? What, Burgundy?

1002
01:12:07,875 --> 01:12:10,048
Oh, Burgundy!

1003
01:12:10,167 --> 01:12:12,590
Really'? Yes, of course, sir.

1004
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:15,962
We can have a coach standing by
for them. Yes, right you are, sir.

1005
01:12:16,083 --> 01:12:19,132
I say, they've had enough of it.
They're ready to pack it up.

1006
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:20,672
- Statement in the press?
- Rather.

1007
01:12:20,792 --> 01:12:22,635
Fleet Street should do us proud on this.

1008
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:53,927
Jolly rotten shame, that's what I say.

1009
01:12:54,042 --> 01:12:56,295
Yeah, starving people out.

1010
01:12:56,417 --> 01:13:00,297
Oi, come and have a look at this!

1011
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:37,128
Five minutes to go.

1012
01:13:40,292 --> 01:13:43,216
- How do we go?
- By the same coach as the kids.

1013
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:45,301
- Oh.
- That's that.

1014
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:52,550
Now I know
what Napoleon felt like before Waterloo.

1015
01:13:52,667 --> 01:13:55,420
- After, Dad.
-  Mum!

1016
01:13:55,542 --> 01:13:57,135
- Hey, Dad!
-  Here you are, Mum.

1017
01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:59,628
- Dad!
- Here you are, Mum!

1018
01:14:08,042 --> 01:14:10,511
Give us another one,
there's a good boy.

1019
01:14:10,625 --> 01:14:14,004
Come on, Benny. Come on, my lad.

1020
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:18,084
- Ah, what do you think of that?
- Been a good boy? Had a nice time?

1021
01:14:18,208 --> 01:14:21,758
Here you are, Mum, catch!
Here you are!

1022
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:23,627
- I would have fetched more for you.
- Haven't got any more.

1023
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:26,391
Pity I didn't have more money,
else I would have got you some more.

1024
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:29,583
- I haven't got no more.
- I'm sorry I haven't got no more, Mum.

1025
01:14:29,708 --> 01:14:31,130
- No more?
- No, I haven't got no more money.

1026
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:35,005
Mummy, here. Guess what'?
I saw you on a newsreel the other day.

1027
01:14:35,125 --> 01:14:37,503
You didn't half look good.

1028
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:48,427
Oh, go on, Dad. Let me feed them too.

1029
01:14:48,542 --> 01:14:50,965
- Oh, go on. Go on, Dad, let me.
- All right, then, go on.

1030
01:14:51,083 --> 01:14:53,085
Here, that's our lunch!

1031
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:20,044
<i>Ho“.!</i>

1032
01:15:31,208 --> 01:15:33,256
I'll ring the station.

1033
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:36,299
Oranges! Nice sweet oranges!

1034
01:15:36,417 --> 01:15:37,464
Oranges!

1035
01:15:42,417 --> 01:15:44,886
Come on, give us a chance!

1036
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:48,795
There they are, Pemberton.

1037
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,252
- Who cares now?
- That's right.

1038
01:15:58,375 --> 01:16:00,969
Tell them what they can do
with their hearse.

1039
01:16:05,583 --> 01:16:07,927
- Mr Pemberton.
- Hello, Mr Straker.

1040
01:16:08,042 --> 01:16:09,885
- Your party ready?
- Well, I don't know.

1041
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,503
Er... things have changed a bit,
haven't they?

1042
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:14,172
Don't say our journey
is entirely fruitless.

1043
01:16:14,292 --> 01:16:16,332
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
We're always open to talk-.

1044
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:18,677
But we expected this to be
unconditional surrender.

1045
01:16:18,792 --> 01:16:20,794
We... we have no powers to negotiate.

1046
01:16:20,917 --> 01:16:23,261
Well, sir, I suggest
you come back when you have.

1047
01:16:26,917 --> 01:16:31,002
- This is where we came in.
- Oh, I wouldn't worry.

1048
01:16:31,125 --> 01:16:34,049
This bit of food
won't last them more than a day.

1049
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:22,583
I say no appeasement!

1050
01:17:37,167 --> 01:17:39,545
Britain can't buy gold.

1051
01:17:39,667 --> 01:17:41,135
Well, that's not
Burgundy's fault, is it?

1052
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:43,002
Well, if you're not prepared
to meet us even halfway...

1053
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:45,298
We are, buy half the gold.

1054
01:18:53,333 --> 01:18:56,177
Ah, my old beauty!
Up the Express Dairy!

1055
01:18:56,292 --> 01:18:57,635
Milko! Milko!

1056
01:18:57,750 --> 01:19:00,594
There she is, the old cow!
Right on time!

1057
01:19:00,708 --> 01:19:03,791
Bang on time! That's the old girl!

1058
01:19:03,917 --> 01:19:09,048
Come on, my little lady!
There's a sight for sore eyes!

1059
01:19:09,167 --> 01:19:11,215
OK?

1060
01:20:14,792 --> 01:20:17,966
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think I have the solution.

1061
01:20:18,083 --> 01:20:20,506
I propose that we lend
the capital of our treasure

1062
01:20:20,625 --> 01:20:22,025
to the Chancellor of the Exchequer,

1063
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:25,542
while the interest is used for the
benefit of the Borough of Pimlico.

1064
01:20:25,667 --> 01:20:28,796
- A Burgundian loan to Britain.
- Ah.

1065
01:20:28,917 --> 01:20:31,090
My dear sir! My very dear sir!

1066
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:33,506
A second Montagu Norman!

1067
01:20:51,042 --> 01:20:54,216
Careful, my man!
You will tear it.

1068
01:20:54,333 --> 01:20:57,337
This was the standard
presented to the Duke Charles

1069
01:20:57,458 --> 01:20:59,005
by the 14 burgers of Bruges.

1070
01:20:59,125 --> 01:21:04,507
I have assured the museum authorities
it shall be returned undamaged.

1071
01:21:09,875 --> 01:21:12,128
Real Burgundy!

1072
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:16,050
You see this vineyard?
It's ten minutes from where we live.

1073
01:21:17,417 --> 01:21:19,920
When you come to Dijon,
I'll take you there.

1074
01:21:26,125 --> 01:21:30,460
Mr Huggins! It's sort of nice
being back at the old shop, isn't it?

1075
01:21:33,167 --> 01:21:35,590
- Is it?
- Yes.

1076
01:21:36,708 --> 01:21:39,177
I'd almost forgotten what it feels like,
handling a lobster.

1077
01:21:39,292 --> 01:21:41,340
Remember one day you said
you'd like to go to Billingsgate?

1078
01:21:41,458 --> 01:21:43,381
Yes?

1079
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,969
Take you there tomorrow.

1080
01:21:46,083 --> 01:21:47,926
Oh, Mr Huggins.

1081
01:22:06,333 --> 01:22:09,382
I never thought anybody would be
pleased to see these things again.

1082
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:12,834
You never know when you're well off
till you aren't.

1083
01:22:16,375 --> 01:22:18,798
Are you nearly ready?

1084
01:22:18,917 --> 01:22:21,466
Yes, shan't be long! Just about!

1085
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:28,131
They're here!

1086
01:22:32,458 --> 01:22:35,337
Do you think we shall get
more than two main dishes?

1087
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:40,043
I hope so. Haven't had a decent feed
since that last deadlock in Moscow.

1088
01:22:40,167 --> 01:22:43,876
And in these last few seconds
before your welcome return,

1089
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,504
I am to express His Majesty's
Government's sincere appreciation

1090
01:22:47,625 --> 01:22:50,174
for your splendid conduct
of internal affairs

1091
01:22:50,292 --> 01:22:53,296
during your temporary absence
from the Kingdom.

1092
01:22:57,792 --> 01:22:59,465
Ladies and gentlemen!

1093
01:23:01,167 --> 01:23:03,090
We're back in England!
