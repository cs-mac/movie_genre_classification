1
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:55,125
<i>1961. The Cold War rages...</i>

2
00:00:55,194 --> 00:00:58,857
<i>between the United States
and the Communist powers.</i>

3
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:03,391
<i>It is a war of nerves, of threats
and bluffs, of military bluster.</i>

4
00:01:03,468 --> 00:01:06,801
<i>Armies and ominous tanks
line the streets of Moscow...</i>

5
00:01:06,872 --> 00:01:09,238
<i>as do missiles with warheads...</i>

6
00:01:09,308 --> 00:01:11,902
<i>carrying the promise of mass destruction.</i>

7
00:01:11,977 --> 00:01:14,844
<i>It is an era of intrigue and espionage.</i>

8
00:01:14,913 --> 00:01:18,872
<i>Soviet spies are routinely
trapped and sent to prisons.</i>

9
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:21,385
<i>Or they are exchanged for American spies...</i>

10
00:01:21,453 --> 00:01:24,217
<i>incarcerated behind the Iron Curtain.</i>

11
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:26,985
<i>Tensions culminate
with the shooting down...</i>

12
00:01:27,059 --> 00:01:30,256
<i>of an American high-altitude
reconnaissance plane...</i>

13
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,695
<i>while a U.N. Ambassador,
Henry Cabot Lodge...</i>

14
00:01:32,764 --> 00:01:38,669
<i>shows a hidden microphone the Reds
disguised in the great seal at an embassy.</i>

15
00:01:38,737 --> 00:01:42,969
<i>Abroad, often in the midst of
bloodthirsty Marxist regimes...</i>

16
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,737
<i>tiny islands of free American territory...</i>

17
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:49,076
<i>in the person of United States embassies...</i>

18
00:01:49,147 --> 00:01:52,583
<i>carry on round-the-clock efforts
to maintain stable relations...</i>

19
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:57,088
<i>often against hostile
and aggressive populations.</i>

20
00:01:57,155 --> 00:01:59,749
<i>One slip in the world
of Cold War diplomacy...</i>

21
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:02,589
<i>could lead instantly to nuclear disaster.</i>

22
00:02:09,668 --> 00:02:11,602
<i>One such free outpost...</i>

23
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,833
<i>deep in Communism's fanatic,
totalitarian underbelly...</i>

24
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:17,204
<i>is where our story takes place.</i>

25
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:20,473
<i>Here in a quaint but sturdy mansion
of traditional structure...</i>

26
00:02:20,545 --> 00:02:24,641
<i>a dedicated and disciplined group
of foreign-service workers...</i>

27
00:02:24,716 --> 00:02:27,014
<i>representing
the United States government...</i>

28
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:30,077
<i>navigate with patience and skill
the treacherous shoals...</i>

29
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:34,091
<i>of international relations
in the Atomic Age.</i>

30
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,095
<i>It is in this small haven
that negotiations take place...</i>

31
00:02:38,163 --> 00:02:43,294
<i>asylum is given and gracious dinners with
dignitaries from all over the world...</i>

32
00:02:43,368 --> 00:02:47,099
<i>are a part of Uncle Sam's
efforts to coexist.</i>

33
00:02:47,172 --> 00:02:52,007
<i>The embassy is run by U.S. Ambassador
Bradley Dunston Magee...</i>

34
00:02:52,077 --> 00:02:54,011
<i>who is proud to serve his nation...</i>

35
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,809
<i>in this poor and hostile environment.</i>

36
00:02:56,882 --> 00:03:01,182
<i>- Soon it'll be fall in Paris.
- Yes, sir.</i>

37
00:03:01,253 --> 00:03:03,778
<i>I wish we were at
the embassy in Paris too, sir.</i>

38
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:07,825
Well, don't.

39
00:03:07,893 --> 00:03:11,158
Because this is where the war is going
to be won or lost with the Reds.

40
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:13,512
They don't need top diplomats
at the Folies-Bergere.

41
00:03:13,525 --> 00:03:14,289
Yes, sir.

42
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:18,132
I didn't mean to imply that the work
we're doing here is not significant.

43
00:03:18,203 --> 00:03:20,137
We've got a job to do,
and we're going to do it.

44
00:03:20,205 --> 00:03:21,712
And we're going to do it
better than anybody else.

45
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:22,230
Yes, sir.

46
00:03:22,307 --> 00:03:24,241
Here are those allocations you requested.

47
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:27,710
<i>In addition to Mr. Burns,
Ambassador Magee is ably abetted...</i>

48
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:30,839
<i>by Mr. John Kilroy, Yale '49.</i>

49
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,180
<i>And Miss Rosemary Pritchard.</i>

50
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:37,551
<i>Mr. Kilroy's view of Karl Marx is
rather straightforward and simple...</i>

51
00:03:37,622 --> 00:03:40,182
<i>and reflects that of Mr. John Wayne.</i>

52
00:03:40,258 --> 00:03:42,453
The only good Communist
is a dead Communist.

53
00:03:42,527 --> 00:03:44,586
- They're like Indians.
- Oh!

54
00:03:44,663 --> 00:03:46,597
- Ah!
- God!

55
00:03:46,665 --> 00:03:49,793
See, I told you.
It's the fourth one this year.

56
00:03:49,868 --> 00:03:52,234
They think they're dealing with children.

57
00:03:52,304 --> 00:03:54,534
<i>Also working under Ambassador Magee...</i>

58
00:03:54,606 --> 00:03:57,006
<i>is yet another young career diplomat.</i>

59
00:03:57,075 --> 00:03:59,407
<i>And here our story begins.</i>

60
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,811
<i>Come in.</i>

61
00:04:02,881 --> 00:04:05,975
<i>- You sent for me, sir?
- Sit down.</i>

62
00:04:06,051 --> 00:04:08,281
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

63
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:12,551
<i>Because of my superior record here,
my accomplishments...</i>

64
00:04:12,624 --> 00:04:16,253
the leaders of my party are discussing
the possibility of a cabinet position for me.

65
00:04:16,328 --> 00:04:18,262
Of course, this is all very hush-hush.

66
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,458
<i>Well, sir, let me say I think you'd be
a wonderful asset to the president.</i>

67
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:26,232
Your broad outlook would appeal to psychotic
liberals as well as militant fascists.

68
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:28,238
Something for everyone.

69
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:31,673
<i>Don't mind telling you this would be a crowning
jewel in a lifetime of foreign service.</i>

70
00:04:31,743 --> 00:04:33,677
<i>- Naturally.
- Closing the deal, however...</i>

71
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:35,940
will take considerable effort on my part.

72
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:38,744
You know how it is.
The right dinner parties.

73
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:41,843
Golf course. Calling in a few favors.

74
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,480
Naturally, my presence
in Washington will be essential.

75
00:04:44,556 --> 00:04:46,990
Sir, I understand,
and I won't let you down.

76
00:04:49,127 --> 00:04:51,823
I'm tempted to leave
Mr. Kilroy in charge...

77
00:04:51,897 --> 00:04:53,922
but I don't think that would
look very good image-wise.

78
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:58,402
Dad... Sir, I realize that my record
at various embassies...

79
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,530
has been less than perfect,
but what can go wrong in two weeks?

80
00:05:01,606 --> 00:05:03,836
You were in Brazil for two weeks,
and you had them importing coffee.

81
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:07,037
- No, see, that was...
- My own son who I raised to be a diplomat...

82
00:05:07,112 --> 00:05:10,377
- was asked to leave Africa.
- Don't get worked up, Dad.

83
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:12,610
Some of the best men
in foreign service have...

84
00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:14,652
at one time or another,
been asked to leave a country.

85
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:18,018
Africa is a continent. You were
recalled from an entire continent.

86
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:20,057
I'm not really a natural
at it, like you are.

87
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,923
You were hung in effigy in Panama!
Even I didn't know that.

88
00:05:22,994 --> 00:05:23,773
I told you that.

89
00:05:23,786 --> 00:05:26,157
Yes, but you didn't tell me
it was by our own embassy!

90
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:28,324
Dad, you've been more than tolerant.

91
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,732
- I realize I've had
a hard time finding myself.

92
00:05:30,802 --> 00:05:33,293
Sorry. A little reflux.

93
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:36,670
If you could just give me this one chance.

94
00:05:36,741 --> 00:05:38,675
- Take this.
- That's glue.

95
00:05:46,718 --> 00:05:48,652
You can trust me, sir.

96
00:05:57,596 --> 00:05:59,530
Mr. Kilroy?

97
00:05:59,598 --> 00:06:03,898
In the ambassador's absence,
I will be in charge here.

98
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:06,437
Now I realize there's some
discrepancy in our experience...

99
00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:11,033
and I don't want that to cause
any awkwardness or resentment.

100
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:14,909
I intend to run a disciplined ship,
but a fair one.

101
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,472
Now the word around here is that
you don't really approve of me.

102
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,484
Am I to believe that?

103
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:24,855
You can speak freely.

104
00:06:24,923 --> 00:06:28,290
I encourage my staff
to honestly express themselves...

105
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,887
<i>in an environment of open frankness.</i>

106
00:06:31,963 --> 00:06:34,022
<i>So, you know, off the record...</i>

107
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:36,033
<i>what do you think of me?</i>

108
00:06:36,101 --> 00:06:40,265
I think you're a moron. Totally
unsuited to the diplomatic corps.

109
00:06:40,338 --> 00:06:42,738
Unequal to the task of fighting Communism.

110
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:45,503
Clinging desperately
to a disastrous career...

111
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:48,011
through the good graces
of your father's connections.

112
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,775
In short, despite
your family's advantages...

113
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:53,340
a born failure.

114
00:06:53,418 --> 00:06:55,978
Ah. You needn't hide your feelings...

115
00:06:56,054 --> 00:06:57,988
just to spare me.

116
00:06:58,056 --> 00:06:59,990
<i>Will that be all?</i>

117
00:07:00,058 --> 00:07:01,923
Yeah. Yes. Th-Thank you.

118
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:04,587
Thank you for being so candid.

119
00:07:04,663 --> 00:07:07,029
You know, it's refreshing
when someone despises you...

120
00:07:07,098 --> 00:07:10,192
to hear it phrased so succinctly.

121
00:07:10,268 --> 00:07:13,601
<i>And so Ambassador Magee
departed for the United States...</i>

122
00:07:13,672 --> 00:07:16,698
<i>to pursue the political plum
of a cabinet position...</i>

123
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:19,209
<i>in the J.F.K. Administration.</i>

124
00:07:19,277 --> 00:07:21,837
<i>And, indeed, the embassy
left in his son's care...</i>

125
00:07:21,913 --> 00:07:24,643
<i>did proceed with business as usual.</i>

126
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:31,245
<i>A daily operation, well oiled
over time by Ambassador Magee...</i>

127
00:07:31,323 --> 00:07:34,383
<i>functioned almost on automatic pilot.</i>

128
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:36,689
<i>Visas were handled and renewed.</i>

129
00:07:36,761 --> 00:07:39,195
<i>A complex and detailed
discussion that took place...</i>

130
00:07:39,264 --> 00:07:42,256
<i>on pressing economic matters went well.</i>

131
00:07:42,334 --> 00:07:45,462
<i>There was even a very successful
cocktail reception...</i>

132
00:07:45,537 --> 00:07:48,734
<i>for a highly-placed Italian industrialist.</i>

133
00:07:48,807 --> 00:07:52,402
<i>And then on the fourth day,
from out of nowhere...</i>

134
00:07:52,477 --> 00:07:54,411
<i>- Yes, sir.
- The crisis occurred.</i>

135
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,438
Yes, we are prepared to receive the emir.

136
00:07:58,516 --> 00:08:00,450
Well...

137
00:08:00,518 --> 00:08:03,316
We're giving him the entire third floor.

138
00:08:03,388 --> 00:08:07,085
He's arriving with a few more in
his entourage than we expected, but...

139
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:10,855
Dad, we converted the library into
a guest bedroom. It just makes it.

140
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:14,387
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

141
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:18,163
No, I'm sorry.
I couldn't hear you. There's...

142
00:08:18,236 --> 00:08:21,069
No, if you want to stay a few
more weeks, it's no problem.

143
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:23,699
<i>Yeah.</i>

144
00:08:23,775 --> 00:08:27,108
They're probably just
shooting one of their poets.

145
00:08:27,178 --> 00:08:29,703
Now, Dad, everything is fine. Sir...

146
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:32,443
Sir, you can relax. I am carrying the ball.

147
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:38,619
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

148
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,817
<i>Sir, would you please help us?</i>

149
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:46,263
We're Americans! Who else
would wear these clothes?

150
00:08:46,331 --> 00:08:49,789
- We're churchpeople.
- Mr. Kilroy!

151
00:08:49,868 --> 00:08:52,029
- Come with me.
- Are you all right?

152
00:08:52,103 --> 00:08:54,148
I'm fine! How could you
tell him we're churchpeople?

153
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:55,095
You know, good people.

154
00:08:57,242 --> 00:08:59,710
- What the hell is going on?
- They were caught in the act of spying.

155
00:08:59,778 --> 00:09:03,179
Oh, man. Please, please.
You can't come in here. Calm down.

156
00:09:03,248 --> 00:09:06,274
<i>Hand them over to us.
We'll drag them out and shoot them.</i>

157
00:09:06,351 --> 00:09:11,220
This embassy's United States territory.
No one will be dragged out and shot.

158
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:14,588
Leave the premises at once. This is an
extreme violation of international conduct.

159
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:17,253
I'm Axel Magee. I'm in charge of this
embassy while the ambassador's away.

160
00:09:17,328 --> 00:09:19,990
Now... I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave immediately.

161
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:23,159
Guns or no guns, if you don't go,
Mr. Kilroy will throw you out.

162
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:24,146
<i>Back up!</i>

163
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:26,931
<i>I think we should issue
a categorical denial...</i>

164
00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:29,906
I don't have the facts. I can't commit
to anything without the facts.

165
00:09:29,974 --> 00:09:33,501
I'm in charge! This will all be settled!

166
00:09:33,578 --> 00:09:36,809
You invade our sanctity with weapons?

167
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:39,748
You wonder how a brutal
dictatorship gets a bad name.

168
00:09:39,818 --> 00:09:41,752
- Okay, that's enough. Come on.
- That's enough.

169
00:09:43,955 --> 00:09:46,617
You have to deny it!
You can't be indecisive!

170
00:09:46,691 --> 00:09:49,558
I wasn't indecisive.
I just couldn't make a decision.

171
00:09:49,627 --> 00:09:52,061
Our government has a fixed policy
regarding espionage.

172
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,064
Did you tell them we're spies?

173
00:09:54,132 --> 00:09:56,828
Will you stop? He's always eavesdropping.

174
00:09:56,901 --> 00:10:00,997
He didn't deny it. They said
we're spies. They say we're spies.

175
00:10:01,072 --> 00:10:04,269
How can I spy? With my eyesight,
I'm gonna be a spy?

176
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:07,539
I didn't tell them you were spies. First
rule, Mr. Kilroy, keep your options open.

177
00:10:07,612 --> 00:10:10,046
First no movie on the plane, now this.

178
00:10:10,115 --> 00:10:12,140
This is all just a simple misunderstanding.

179
00:10:12,217 --> 00:10:14,151
Simple? What do you mean, simple?
How simple?

180
00:10:14,219 --> 00:10:16,744
If we leave the building, they shoot us.
Is that simple enough?

181
00:10:16,821 --> 00:10:19,381
First there'd be like a show trial,
then they'd shoot you.

182
00:10:19,457 --> 00:10:22,858
- Who is this guy?
- Perhaps we should notify Ambassador Magee.

183
00:10:22,927 --> 00:10:26,328
- That will not be necessary.
- A man takes his family on a vacation...

184
00:10:26,397 --> 00:10:28,922
and this is what we have
working in our government.

185
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,662
- Then they wonder why I don't vote.
- I have done nothing wrong here.

186
00:10:31,736 --> 00:10:32,597
Me neither.

187
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,228
Why did you take pictures?
You knew it was forbidden.

188
00:10:35,306 --> 00:10:37,467
I didn't think they'd see. I have a Minox.

189
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:41,000
- What did you think when the sirens went off?
- I thought it was lunch break.

190
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:43,980
- What did you photograph?
- Nothing. The sunset.

191
00:10:44,048 --> 00:10:46,949
If you knew it was a sunset,
how could the sirens be lunch?

192
00:10:47,018 --> 00:10:48,952
Leave me alone because I got a headache.

193
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,784
They're paranoid, and you're
a nudge for the whole trip.

194
00:10:51,856 --> 00:10:55,087
You know, he's right. He is right.
Everything, they hide.

195
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,685
I don't know why
I listen to you in the first place.

196
00:10:57,762 --> 00:11:00,754
Every time I listen to what you say,
I wind up behind the eight ball.

197
00:11:00,832 --> 00:11:03,164
- Here we go again.
- A man has a vacation.

198
00:11:03,234 --> 00:11:06,965
He wants to take his family someplace. I
said we'll get a cabana in Atlantic Beach.

199
00:11:07,038 --> 00:11:09,199
Every year it has to be Atlantic Beach?

200
00:11:09,274 --> 00:11:11,834
To what? Sit in the sun and hear you
complain about over-freckling?

201
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,071
No, this is better. Europe is better.

202
00:11:14,145 --> 00:11:17,080
$6,000 for three weeks
of uninterrupted diarrhea.

203
00:11:17,148 --> 00:11:20,174
What's so terrible? My brother
suggested we see Europe.

204
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:21,478
He had a wonderful time.

205
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:24,017
I have to live for her brother.
Do you hear this?

206
00:11:24,088 --> 00:11:26,989
- That's a hot one.
- I know you folks are excited...

207
00:11:27,058 --> 00:11:29,526
- Sorry.
- That's all right. I gotta get a few facts here.

208
00:11:29,594 --> 00:11:33,052
Yes, Mr. And Mrs. Walter Hollander.
Newark, New Jersey.

209
00:11:33,131 --> 00:11:35,565
I'll give you the facts.
The facts are I get a vacation.

210
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:39,262
I want to take my family someplace.
So I say we'll go to Atlantic Beach.

211
00:11:39,337 --> 00:11:41,737
We'll swim. There's miniature golf.
We can play pinochle.

212
00:11:41,806 --> 00:11:44,502
No! Her brother says go to Europe.
We gotta go to Eur...

213
00:11:44,576 --> 00:11:47,841
And we must... He tells us we must go
behind the Iron Curtain.

214
00:11:47,912 --> 00:11:50,403
Meanwhile, on his vacation,
he went to the French Riviera.

215
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:52,915
Aren't you interested to see
how the other half lives?

216
00:11:52,984 --> 00:11:55,509
We went with you
to the Crazy Horse in Paris.

217
00:11:55,587 --> 00:11:58,988
A striptease joint. He takes me to
where women get completely naked.

218
00:11:59,057 --> 00:12:01,890
Are you comparing Communism to those girls?

219
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,894
As if he appreciates Europe anyway.

220
00:12:03,962 --> 00:12:05,987
We took him to Westminster Abbey,
his feet hurt.

221
00:12:06,064 --> 00:12:09,227
We took him to Buckingham Palace,
he tried to make the guards laugh.

222
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,359
We took him to the Sistine Chapel,
he never saw the mural.

223
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:14,462
The mural's on the ceiling.
I can't look up. I get dizzy.

224
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:17,406
- He had to paint the mural on the ceiling?
- In the Louvre...

225
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:19,602
I took him to see the statue
of Venus de Milo.

226
00:12:19,677 --> 00:12:22,475
I turn away for one minute,
he's caressing the bosom.

227
00:12:22,547 --> 00:12:24,481
- She cannot take a joke.
- The man is caressing the bosom.

228
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:27,017
Yes, I felt the statue.
She cannot take a joke.

229
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:30,179
Have either you ever had any stomach
ailments or respiratory problems?

230
00:12:30,255 --> 00:12:31,223
What is he doing?

231
00:12:31,236 --> 00:12:34,123
I have this brother... You
see, I have this brother.

232
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:36,319
<i>- He's a wonderful man.
- He's a Nazi.</i>

233
00:12:36,394 --> 00:12:38,885
- Do you know what you're talking about?
- He should be wearing an armband.

234
00:12:38,963 --> 00:12:42,296
- Take my word for it.
- Here we go. "Request for Asylum."

235
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:46,428
What about asylum? I'm a caterer
from New Jersey. What do I need asylum?

236
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:49,564
I'm gonna need your passports,
and I gotta get some other information.

237
00:12:49,641 --> 00:12:52,041
I'm giving information.
It began with my brother.

238
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,136
- He's quite a lovely individual.
- They should have hung him at Nuremberg.

239
00:12:55,213 --> 00:12:57,773
"Have you ever bought anything
on credit?" What the hell is this?

240
00:12:57,849 --> 00:12:59,817
What is what l... What are we doing here?

241
00:12:59,884 --> 00:13:03,320
A man goes on a vacation... This is crazy.

242
00:13:03,388 --> 00:13:06,084
- You know, here. Who has the passports?
- That's fine.

243
00:13:06,157 --> 00:13:08,455
Hollander and Blackwell.
I'm a caterer from Newark.

244
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:11,154
Take my card. You'll find us in...

245
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:14,562
- Here.
- Great. Do you work, Mrs. Hollander?

246
00:13:14,632 --> 00:13:16,862
No, no, sir. I'm an average housewife.

247
00:13:16,935 --> 00:13:19,267
She's a professional mah-jongg hustler.

248
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:21,362
She travels around
with her own tiles in a case.

249
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:24,636
Okay, now, you innocently
snapped some photos? Is that...

250
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:26,768
Yes, we wandered away from a guided tour.

251
00:13:26,844 --> 00:13:30,336
- His sense of direction is terrible.
- What are you telling him this for?

252
00:13:30,415 --> 00:13:33,646
Will you listen to me, Mr. Magee?
He starts out driving to the Catskills...

253
00:13:33,718 --> 00:13:36,846
- and he winds up in the Adirondacks.
- She has all the answers.

254
00:13:36,921 --> 00:13:39,754
Then they started to chase you, and
you had the good sense to come here.

255
00:13:39,824 --> 00:13:43,351
- My daughter had the presence of mind.
- It's a good thing she did.

256
00:13:43,428 --> 00:13:45,896
So you could tell her we're spies,
'cause you don't deny it.

257
00:13:45,964 --> 00:13:49,525
- I didn't say anything.
- My wife should not have to go through this.

258
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,036
- She's not a young woman.
- What do you mean, I'm an old woman?

259
00:13:53,104 --> 00:13:57,131
I'm not saying old. You're not old,
but she had bridge work recently.

260
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:00,177
Look, I just don't think
there's anything to worry about.

261
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:02,212
Sure, 'cause I'm a caterer, not a spy.

262
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,339
Creative catering is our specialty.

263
00:14:04,415 --> 00:14:06,906
We were the first to make
the bridgegroom out of potato salad.

264
00:14:06,985 --> 00:14:08,919
He does lovely work.
I'll have to say that for him.

265
00:14:08,987 --> 00:14:12,582
Last month we did an affair. I made
the bridegroom from potato salad.

266
00:14:12,657 --> 00:14:14,887
The head was a jello mold,
and there was a clam dip...

267
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,893
that we did the rest of the body in.

268
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:18,588
Fruit punch spouting...

269
00:14:18,663 --> 00:14:20,654
- It was a marvelous affair.
- Beautiful. It was.

270
00:14:20,732 --> 00:14:23,030
I should be able to straighten
this out in a few days.

271
00:14:23,101 --> 00:14:25,569
A few days? What are you, nuts?
I'm not gonna stay here a few days.

272
00:14:25,636 --> 00:14:27,570
We'll have Mr. Burns set up some cots.

273
00:14:27,638 --> 00:14:29,936
Cots! This is getting worse and worse.

274
00:14:30,008 --> 00:14:33,171
I can't sleep on a cot. I'm a dignified
human being with a hernia.

275
00:14:33,244 --> 00:14:36,179
Mr. Hollander, this is an emergency.
We're gonna try the best we can, okay?

276
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:39,444
No, I can't stay here.
This is the height of the season.

277
00:14:39,517 --> 00:14:41,508
Sam Blackwell can't run
the business without me.

278
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:43,554
Look, he's a wonderful man.

279
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:46,681
I have respect for him. He's my partner.
He's a lovely individual...

280
00:14:46,758 --> 00:14:49,056
but the man is a total abject imbecile.

281
00:14:49,127 --> 00:14:51,618
It'll be all right.
Alvin'll come in. His son'll come in.

282
00:14:51,696 --> 00:14:52,608
He's over 21.

283
00:14:52,621 --> 00:14:55,393
Son? Who's gonna dress him?
He's dumber than his father.

284
00:14:55,466 --> 00:14:58,526
- I'm sure the business can wait a couple of days.
- Folks, that's it for me.

285
00:14:58,603 --> 00:15:02,266
I'm sorry if I damaged anything,
but now I'm going to America.

286
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,274
Mr. Magee, what do you
think's gonna happen?

287
00:15:04,342 --> 00:15:07,311
- I'm a caterer. Let 'em capture me.
- This is preposterous.

288
00:15:07,378 --> 00:15:10,506
They want information, I'll tell them
how to make grapefruit sections.

289
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:13,311
- Mr. Hollander, you can't just go out there.
- You know what? Let him go.

290
00:15:13,384 --> 00:15:16,114
Go ahead, big shot. Listen,
we'll be in here if you want us.

291
00:15:16,187 --> 00:15:18,712
- Go ahead. There's the front door.
- You think I'm afraid to go out?

292
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,725
- I'm afraid...
- No. Why should you be afraid?

293
00:15:21,793 --> 00:15:24,694
They're only police. They'll arrest you,
torture you. What's to be afraid of?

294
00:15:24,762 --> 00:15:27,060
- Yeah, I'm afraid.
- No. Mrs. Hollander...

295
00:15:27,131 --> 00:15:29,224
Go ahead. Go, go. Get brainwashed.

296
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,234
In your case, it'll probably help.

297
00:15:31,302 --> 00:15:33,896
- I urge you not to do anything rash.
- Let him go. Go ahead.

298
00:15:33,971 --> 00:15:36,599
- You don't think I'll go?
- Good-bye! Go!

299
00:15:42,747 --> 00:15:45,011
Do you know if any of those guys
belong to the Masons?

300
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,210
- Ach, you're starting with the Masons.
- The Masons!

301
00:15:47,285 --> 00:15:49,219
<i>- Here they are. Everything's fine.
- Where have you been?</i>

302
00:15:49,287 --> 00:15:52,051
I'm sorry. They had me upstairs.
You wouldn't believe what's outside.

303
00:15:52,123 --> 00:15:54,318
Like 12 armies all with their guns drawn.

304
00:15:54,392 --> 00:15:56,360
- You're all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine, Ma. I'm fine.

305
00:15:56,427 --> 00:15:58,725
Mr. Magee, this is my daughter Susan.

306
00:15:58,796 --> 00:16:01,560
- She was a cesarean.
- Pleased. Axel Magee.

307
00:16:01,632 --> 00:16:04,533
- When will we be free to go home?
- Well, home...

308
00:16:04,602 --> 00:16:07,503
Tell her, tell her. We're liable
to be here two, three days.

309
00:16:07,572 --> 00:16:10,132
- Two, three days? What about Seth?
- Seth?

310
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,142
Seth. Our son Seth. You remem...

311
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,906
Forgive my wife. In her panic, she
forgot that she gave birth twice.

312
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:17,573
<i>No, no, I-I didn't think
'cause he's at camp.</i>

313
00:16:17,648 --> 00:16:19,616
Camp ends tomorrow.
What are you talking about?

314
00:16:19,684 --> 00:16:21,743
The kid'll be home. He'll be unsupervised.

315
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:24,344
We're here. He's in the streets.
He'll be running amok.

316
00:16:24,422 --> 00:16:27,585
He'll be raping and looting.
This kid takes after her brother.

317
00:16:27,658 --> 00:16:30,786
<i>Oh, my God. And Susan's
getting married in two weeks.</i>

318
00:16:30,862 --> 00:16:33,057
That's right. I have a deposit
on the hall. Now what?

319
00:16:33,131 --> 00:16:35,565
If we're squeezed for time, we'll
have to push it back. That's what.

320
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:38,397
The date's been set.
We're not pushing anything.

321
00:16:38,469 --> 00:16:41,165
Maybe she's right. We may
be able to push the date back.

322
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:45,369
So you better call the owner of
the Renaissance Luau and deal with it.

323
00:16:45,443 --> 00:16:47,377
What are we talking about? Call Donald.

324
00:16:47,445 --> 00:16:50,209
<i>- Tell him that... He'll be worried sick.
- Okay, I'll call Donald.</i>

325
00:16:50,281 --> 00:16:53,045
<i>Mr. Magee, what's the longest
anyone's had to stay here?</i>

326
00:16:53,117 --> 00:16:55,608
Uh, we have a priest
who came to us for asylum.

327
00:16:55,686 --> 00:16:58,348
He's been living upstairs for a while.

328
00:16:58,422 --> 00:17:00,583
What is "a while"?

329
00:17:00,658 --> 00:17:03,491
<i>- A while.
- How long?</i>

330
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:05,995
Uh, six years.

331
00:17:06,063 --> 00:17:08,122
<i>- Six years.
- Oh, my God.</i>

332
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:11,362
I said let's go to Atlantic Beach.
We'll swim, we'll play pinochle.

333
00:17:11,435 --> 00:17:13,494
No! Her brother says go to Europe.

334
00:17:13,571 --> 00:17:15,869
<i>- May he rest in peace.
- He's not dead.</i>

335
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,602
He will be as soon as I get back.

336
00:17:23,648 --> 00:17:26,242
<i>I saw it. It was a tiny camera.</i>

337
00:17:26,317 --> 00:17:30,117
I don't understand. Why is there
no electronic surveillance report?

338
00:17:30,188 --> 00:17:33,453
Unfortunately, they must have discovered
the wires. We're getting nothing.

339
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:35,685
They don't appear to be spies.
They look like a family.

340
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,026
<i>I wouldn't be taken in by appearances.
Note how careful the executive officer was...</i>

341
00:17:40,097 --> 00:17:43,089
to avoid denying any accusation.

342
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:46,625
Absolutely correct. What puzzles me is...

343
00:17:46,704 --> 00:17:50,572
how he knew to take pictures
at that exact intersection?

344
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:52,575
<i>There must be spies amongst our own ranks.</i>

345
00:17:52,643 --> 00:17:56,204
I've long suspected people
in our own organization.

346
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,748
Leaks now can prove fatal.

347
00:17:58,816 --> 00:18:02,183
<i>I want the photos and I want Hollanders.</i>

348
00:18:02,253 --> 00:18:05,279
What I'm afraid of is that
before we can move...

349
00:18:05,356 --> 00:18:09,759
they will be used in an exchange
for certain agents the K.G.B. Must...

350
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:13,456
Once in our possession,
the Hollanders will talk.

351
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:15,761
And then heads will roll.

352
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:31,008
So then they shot at Walter,
and we raced down the block.

353
00:18:31,082 --> 00:18:33,016
They're horrible Communists...

354
00:18:33,084 --> 00:18:36,781
with secret police and
those vicious dogs and... God knows.

355
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:40,187
We may be stuck here for years,
so save the puzzles.

356
00:18:40,258 --> 00:18:42,488
No, it's really a beautiful place, Carol.

357
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,120
They set up these kind
of fold-out beds for us...

358
00:18:45,196 --> 00:18:47,687
in this conference room library.

359
00:18:47,765 --> 00:18:52,134
You'd love Mr. Magee.
He's really very attractive.

360
00:18:52,203 --> 00:18:54,137
I don't know if I miss Donald.

361
00:18:54,205 --> 00:18:56,400
Don't even ask me that question.
Then I get all confused.

362
00:18:56,474 --> 00:18:59,034
The migraines come back.

363
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,044
So how are things in Newark?

364
00:19:01,112 --> 00:19:03,046
Elsie?

365
00:19:03,114 --> 00:19:05,048
Elsie, here's what I want you to do.

366
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:08,108
I want you to go...
I want you to go into my bedroom...

367
00:19:08,185 --> 00:19:11,120
and look under my pillow.

368
00:19:11,188 --> 00:19:13,850
Look under the pillow. Do you...

369
00:19:13,924 --> 00:19:17,325
There's a small piece of gray flannel.

370
00:19:17,395 --> 00:19:21,161
I want you to take it and wrap it up.
I want you to mail it to me.

371
00:19:21,232 --> 00:19:24,133
Because I'm under tremendous stress...

372
00:19:24,201 --> 00:19:27,967
and I know I'm not gonna be able to
sleep unless I have my piece of flannel.

373
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:30,166
Yeah, piece of flannel.

374
00:19:30,241 --> 00:19:33,506
Where I suck the tip.

375
00:19:33,577 --> 00:19:37,206
<i>They're taking a very
hard line. Obviously, it's strategic.</i>

376
00:19:37,281 --> 00:19:39,943
<i>What did Washington say?</i>

377
00:19:40,017 --> 00:19:43,316
Well, the truth is, I haven't
contacted the home office yet.

378
00:19:43,387 --> 00:19:46,982
- A formal complaint is in order.
- We have time, Mr. Kilroy.

379
00:19:47,058 --> 00:19:49,322
Then I strongly suggest we cancel
plans to host the emir.

380
00:19:49,393 --> 00:19:51,327
Our Arab friends can be unpredictable.

381
00:19:51,395 --> 00:19:53,386
I think it would be an extreme loss
of face for the emir...

382
00:19:53,464 --> 00:19:56,627
if he were suddenly not permitted
to be our country's guest.

383
00:19:56,701 --> 00:20:00,296
It's a question of space. The emir
will take up the whole third floor.

384
00:20:00,371 --> 00:20:03,306
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- No. Hi. Come in.

385
00:20:03,374 --> 00:20:06,036
- Are you sure? 'Cause...
- Yeah.

386
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,943
Mr. Kilroy, we can...
We'll work this out later.

387
00:20:09,013 --> 00:20:11,811
As you wish.

388
00:20:11,882 --> 00:20:14,783
- Am I interrupting? I can come back.
- No, it's fine.

389
00:20:14,852 --> 00:20:16,888
'Cause I don't want to take
up too much of your time.

390
00:20:16,901 --> 00:20:17,582
No problem.

391
00:20:17,655 --> 00:20:21,147
I just wanted to thank you for the
accommodations. Everyone's been really nice.

392
00:20:21,225 --> 00:20:21,970
Oh, good.

393
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:24,251
It's a lovely place to be
under the right circumstances.

394
00:20:24,328 --> 00:20:26,311
We'll try to get you out
of here as soon as we can.

395
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:27,320
We really appreciate it.

396
00:20:27,398 --> 00:20:30,231
- Your dad is really anxious.
- My da... Oh.

397
00:20:30,301 --> 00:20:33,099
No, he's like that all the time.
My parents...

398
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,661
Well, they're not like that
all the time. I mean...

399
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:39,437
they kind of have a funny way
of communicating with each other.

400
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,274
Deep down, they're affectionate.
They really like each other...

401
00:20:42,346 --> 00:20:46,248
but, I don't know, what you see
is what I envision the Huns to be.

402
00:20:47,518 --> 00:20:50,078
Yeah, well, you know,
it's gotta be hard for them.

403
00:20:50,154 --> 00:20:52,088
Oh, would you like something to drink?

404
00:20:52,156 --> 00:20:55,648
We've got a local white wine. It's, uh...

405
00:20:55,726 --> 00:20:58,126
light, but kind of sneaks up on you.

406
00:20:58,195 --> 00:21:00,459
Oh, I could use something serious.
Thank you.

407
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:04,667
So...

408
00:21:07,037 --> 00:21:09,130
What do you do?

409
00:21:09,206 --> 00:21:12,733
Uh, not a lot. I majored
in philosophy at Rutgers...

410
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:16,871
and now I don't feel equipped
to do much of anything...

411
00:21:16,947 --> 00:21:19,677
except think about
the universe, which I do.

412
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,413
I don't know. I could open
a philosophy shop and sell concepts.

413
00:21:26,524 --> 00:21:28,458
- So what do you think about...
- What do I think?

414
00:21:28,526 --> 00:21:31,051
- About the universe.
- Oh, um...

415
00:21:31,128 --> 00:21:34,427
Well, I think it's a,
you know, rough place to be...

416
00:21:34,498 --> 00:21:36,898
unless, of course, you
have someone to share it with.

417
00:21:36,967 --> 00:21:39,333
That makes it easier.

418
00:21:39,403 --> 00:21:43,464
- Fortunately, you do.
- Yes, I do. I hope you do too.

419
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,510
Well, I travel a lot.
Suddenly and unexpectedly.

420
00:21:46,577 --> 00:21:49,410
It must be exciting, you know,
to be in all those different countries.

421
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,608
Mr. Kilroy said you've been in almost
every embassy. That's really amazing.

422
00:21:52,683 --> 00:21:55,015
He said that? Well, not every embassy.

423
00:21:55,085 --> 00:21:57,019
It doesn't sneak up on you,
it just attacks.

424
00:21:57,087 --> 00:21:58,154
You haven't eaten, right?

425
00:21:58,167 --> 00:22:00,284
Look how quickly I'm
talking personally with you.

426
00:22:00,357 --> 00:22:02,587
<i>- I don't like to be forward.
- Don't be silly.</i>

427
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,128
Wine or no wine,
I promise, no more questions.

428
00:22:05,196 --> 00:22:07,664
<i>- What school did you go to?
- Harvard.</i>

429
00:22:07,731 --> 00:22:11,599
<i>I wanted to go to art school,
but my family had other plans.</i>

430
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:13,603
Oh. That's too bad.

431
00:22:13,671 --> 00:22:16,697
What does your fiancee do?

432
00:22:16,774 --> 00:22:20,175
Um, I don't...
I don't have a fiancee. You do.

433
00:22:20,244 --> 00:22:23,236
Oh! That's right.
Look at me. I'm drunk already.

434
00:22:23,314 --> 00:22:26,249
- Notice I'm not asking you questions.
- That's all right.

435
00:22:29,053 --> 00:22:31,715
- So what does he do? Your fiance.
- Oh, Donald.

436
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:34,724
He's a dermatologist.
We met at Trader Vic's.

437
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:38,819
I was choking on some cosmo tidbits.
It's actually an interesting story.

438
00:22:38,896 --> 00:22:41,831
He reached down my throat
and pulled out a toothpick...

439
00:22:41,899 --> 00:22:43,833
with a half-eaten shrimp on the end of it.

440
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:46,392
- Huh.
- Later that night, we made love.

441
00:22:48,672 --> 00:22:51,732
Beverly, you heard?

442
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:55,006
Oh, no, no. It's a lovely place.

443
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:58,071
But if you ask me, whoever
dusts doesn't do a good job.

444
00:22:58,148 --> 00:23:01,982
<i>Leave me alone, please. I don't like
European food. I never liked it.</i>

445
00:23:02,052 --> 00:23:04,247
<i>- So I'm a Philistine.
- Do we have a problem here?</i>

446
00:23:04,321 --> 00:23:06,255
Every dish I name, he says no.

447
00:23:06,323 --> 00:23:08,689
Mr. Hollander, if you have any
special request, I'm sure Oscar...

448
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:10,852
We are 4,000 miles from the United States.

449
00:23:10,928 --> 00:23:14,557
It's a Communist country. It's 8:00
at night. I can't get lean brisket!

450
00:23:14,632 --> 00:23:16,896
- Fish! What about fish?
- Octopus.

451
00:23:16,967 --> 00:23:19,026
No, not octopus. Not monsters.

452
00:23:19,103 --> 00:23:22,834
- I mean fish, regular fish.
- Oysters, lovely oysters.

453
00:23:22,907 --> 00:23:25,341
Oysters are alive. I don't eat live food.

454
00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:28,401
I want my food dead.
Not sick, not wounded. Dead.

455
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:30,709
<i>The jellied calf's foot.</i>

456
00:23:30,781 --> 00:23:33,614
<i>Marion, you hear this? He wants me
to eat a jellied calf's foot.</i>

457
00:23:33,684 --> 00:23:37,017
Because of where we are and who we
entertain, our menu can be a little exotic.

458
00:23:37,087 --> 00:23:39,954
So plain boiled chicken.
Is that so complicated?

459
00:23:40,024 --> 00:23:42,219
<i>Usually he has a very nice appetite.</i>

460
00:23:42,293 --> 00:23:44,227
Look how I can't get a meal here.

461
00:23:44,295 --> 00:23:46,229
I'll come in the kitchen.
I'll make you something.

462
00:23:46,297 --> 00:23:48,288
<i>- In my kitchen?
- Don't worry. I know...</i>

463
00:23:48,365 --> 00:23:51,300
Not in my kitchen. No one
works in my kitchen except me.

464
00:23:51,368 --> 00:23:53,859
The cutlery... I have everything just so.

465
00:23:53,938 --> 00:23:56,463
My spice rack. You'll mix up
the order of my spice rack.

466
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,338
I'm getting dizzy. The blinding
headaches are returning.

467
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,776
<i>- I need some water! Cold water!
- Marion.</i>

468
00:24:01,845 --> 00:24:05,406
It's good to know our food is
being cooked by an outpatient.

469
00:24:05,482 --> 00:24:07,814
I spoke to Barney Silverman on the phone.

470
00:24:07,885 --> 00:24:10,080
Did you tell him not to bother
to come to Idyllwild Airport...

471
00:24:10,154 --> 00:24:13,055
with the station wagon
because we may be six years late?

472
00:24:13,123 --> 00:24:15,318
Mrs. Hollander, I meant to speak
to you about the telephone.

473
00:24:15,392 --> 00:24:18,190
You're free to use the phone as much as you'd
like, but if you could limit the calls...

474
00:24:18,262 --> 00:24:20,457
This is nothing for her. Let me tell you.

475
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:24,592
She's got to alert everyone in Newark
individually like Paul Revere.

476
00:24:24,668 --> 00:24:28,104
I called the Kleins. They're gonna
take care of Seth till we get back.

477
00:24:28,172 --> 00:24:30,697
The Kleins?
You couldn't pick a worse couple.

478
00:24:30,774 --> 00:24:33,436
- Why? What's wrong with the Kleins?
- They have orgies.

479
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:36,741
- How do you know?
- I catered one. Terrible. These are terrible.

480
00:24:37,381 --> 00:24:38,973
Hey, Ma, Dad, guess who I found upstairs.

481
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:40,983
Father Drobney, what brings you down here?

482
00:24:41,051 --> 00:24:44,077
I heard such a commotion today, and
I met this lovely young lady upstairs.

483
00:24:44,154 --> 00:24:46,281
These are the Hollanders,
Father Drobney. They came to us today...

484
00:24:46,357 --> 00:24:48,552
under much the same circumstances
you did six years ago.

485
00:24:48,626 --> 00:24:52,323
- Oh, you're refugees.
- Refugees? You know what I paid for this shirt?

486
00:24:52,396 --> 00:24:55,365
<i>- We were at the Vatican. We saw your boss.</i>

487
00:24:55,432 --> 00:24:58,128
- Excuse me.
- He's got this tiny little room on the top floor.

488
00:24:58,202 --> 00:25:01,501
- If it's for me...
- So, what, you don't go crazy up there?

489
00:25:01,572 --> 00:25:04,040
Mm, I'm a guest through
the courtesy of your government.

490
00:25:04,108 --> 00:25:06,133
I do not wish to make myself a nuisance.

491
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,264
Can't you leave here?

492
00:25:07,277 --> 00:25:10,010
Only if there's some drastic
change in national policy.

493
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,105
I have friends who could help me escape...

494
00:25:12,182 --> 00:25:16,846
but I feel it is my duty to return and
someday lead my people once again.

495
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,548
But until you lead your people,
you stay in your bedroom?

496
00:25:19,623 --> 00:25:23,957
Over the years I have developed a hobby,
and so it passes the lonely moments.

497
00:25:24,028 --> 00:25:25,962
<i>- What do you do?
- Father Drobney's a magician.</i>

498
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,965
<i>- I've been practicing for years. Years!
- That's a wonderful hobby.</i>

499
00:25:29,033 --> 00:25:31,866
Okay, pick a card, any card.

500
00:25:31,935 --> 00:25:34,460
Don't show me, show your brains.
Let's go. Pick a card.

501
00:25:34,538 --> 00:25:36,529
I'm not forcing. Here we go.

502
00:25:36,607 --> 00:25:38,666
Anybody pick a card. Okay.

503
00:25:38,742 --> 00:25:41,006
How about you, sir? How about you,
ma'am? Pick a card.

504
00:25:41,078 --> 00:25:43,205
- I'm gonna pick a card.
- Don't matter to me.

505
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,681
Show your brains. Okay.
Place the card in the deck.

506
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:51,449
Okay, one. Your card is...
the three of diamonds!

507
00:25:51,522 --> 00:25:53,456
- Five of hearts.
- Aha! Aha!

508
00:25:53,524 --> 00:25:54,121
So sorry.

509
00:25:54,134 --> 00:25:55,958
Father Drobney has all sorts
of interesting things up there.

510
00:25:56,026 --> 00:25:58,324
- Don't you, Father?
- Doves. Ooh, I have white doves.

511
00:25:58,395 --> 00:26:01,023
I raise them. I transform them
before your very eyes.

512
00:26:01,098 --> 00:26:03,396
Bring some of your things down.
I think we'd all like to see them.

513
00:26:03,467 --> 00:26:05,401
<i>- Ja! Ooh!
- For entertainment.</i>

514
00:26:05,469 --> 00:26:07,403
<i>- We would. Yes. Wouldn't we, Walter?
- Would you really?</i>

515
00:26:07,471 --> 00:26:09,769
Sure. Why do you think I had us
trapped here? So we could watch him.

516
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,967
I'll be right back.
An audience! An audience!

517
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:15,500
I'll do rings, the disappearing
handkerchief. Ooh!

518
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:17,547
And my magic billiard balls!

519
00:26:17,614 --> 00:26:20,139
<i>Terrific. It's The Ed Sullivan Show.</i>

520
00:26:20,217 --> 00:26:22,344
Don't go. I'll be right back. Please stay.

521
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:25,752
<i>Don't worry. You can count on it.
We'll be here when you get downstairs.</i>

522
00:26:25,823 --> 00:26:28,291
Imagine staying in your room
and practicing magic for six years.

523
00:26:28,358 --> 00:26:29,313
<i>You'd go crazy.</i>

524
00:26:29,326 --> 00:26:32,226
<i>What about us? What if the
same thing happens to us?</i>

525
00:26:32,296 --> 00:26:35,629
Why do you compare?
We're innocent tourists. He's a priest.

526
00:26:35,699 --> 00:26:37,792
I'm sure he could get out of here
if he made some effort...

527
00:26:37,868 --> 00:26:39,802
but you know how it is with those guys.

528
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,838
The one who suffers most
gets the promotion.

529
00:26:41,905 --> 00:26:44,470
<i>Okay. We've managed to retrieve
the luggage from the hotel.</i>

530
00:26:44,483 --> 00:26:45,341
<i>Wonderful.</i>

531
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:47,343
- It was 19 pieces?
- Yes, thank you.

532
00:26:47,411 --> 00:26:50,778
Mr. Hollander, I think we've solved your
dinner problem. The chef is making you hare.

533
00:26:50,848 --> 00:26:53,373
What's "hair"?

534
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,384
<i>- Hare.
- What's "hair"?</i>

535
00:26:55,452 --> 00:26:57,386
Hare's rabbit, Dad. Hare. Rabbit.

536
00:26:57,454 --> 00:27:00,321
<i>- Pardon? What do you mean?
- It's a rabbit.</i>

537
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,018
<i>It's the closest thing
to chicken the chef could find.</i>

538
00:27:03,093 --> 00:27:05,027
- Bunny rabbit?
- It's delicious.

539
00:27:05,095 --> 00:27:07,359
If you don't ask him, he'll eat
whatever you put in front of him.

540
00:27:07,431 --> 00:27:09,365
Rabbit, like Peter Rabbit, right? Rabbit?

541
00:27:09,433 --> 00:27:11,697
If I told you it was a chicken,
you wouldn't know the difference.

542
00:27:11,769 --> 00:27:15,170
I'm gonna eat a furry object?
What's wrong with you, Marion?

543
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:17,867
There's not a Chinese restaurant
here we can order out?

544
00:27:17,941 --> 00:27:19,875
<i>- I'm back!
- Oh! He's back.</i>

545
00:27:19,943 --> 00:27:22,776
I could only carry the small items, but...

546
00:27:22,846 --> 00:27:25,713
it's enough for
the first few hours of the show.

547
00:27:25,783 --> 00:27:28,343
<i>How many hours does the show last?</i>

548
00:27:28,418 --> 00:27:31,387
<i>- Ha, ha!
- I can't believe this.</i>

549
00:27:31,455 --> 00:27:34,253
Take this, please. Okay!

550
00:27:36,326 --> 00:27:39,056
I have dreamed of this moment for years.

551
00:27:39,129 --> 00:27:41,495
What miracle shall I start with?

552
00:27:41,565 --> 00:27:43,795
I don't know. Can you walk on water?

553
00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:48,167
Okay. Watch this.

554
00:27:51,074 --> 00:27:53,008
Oh.

555
00:27:55,712 --> 00:27:58,772
Ladies and gentlemen. Nothing up my robes.

556
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:02,751
- Wonderful, Walter. A tricky priest.
- Great.

557
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:06,620
Nothing... in my cylinder.

558
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,817
Nothing in my cage.

559
00:28:08,892 --> 00:28:12,191
Okay. Please watch carefully.

560
00:28:13,697 --> 00:28:16,393
<i>I don't need a vaudeville
show. I need a sandwich.</i>

561
00:28:16,466 --> 00:28:20,527
I place this dove inside the cylinder...

562
00:28:20,604 --> 00:28:23,937
and say a few magic words.

563
00:28:24,007 --> 00:28:28,444
<i>And... where there was
previously a dove, is miraculously...</i>

564
00:28:28,512 --> 00:28:31,242
Where's my rabbit? I had a rabbit.

565
00:28:31,315 --> 00:28:33,806
How do you like it?
Rare, medium, well-done?

566
00:28:33,884 --> 00:28:35,818
<i>Hey, that's my rabbit!</i>

567
00:28:35,886 --> 00:28:38,081
You! You assassin!

568
00:28:38,155 --> 00:28:41,249
<i>- Come back here!
- Stop! Stop this now!</i>

569
00:28:41,325 --> 00:28:46,126
This is a United States embassy,
and I intend to run it like one!

570
00:28:48,198 --> 00:28:50,564
- Your bird.
- Take the bird! Take the bird!

571
00:28:50,634 --> 00:28:55,128
<i>Days pass, and
the situation remains unchanged.</i>

572
00:28:55,205 --> 00:28:59,699
<i>And as the crisis reaches the end of
week two, nerves have become frazzled.</i>

573
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:02,074
- Oh, you could do better, Frank.
- What?

574
00:29:02,145 --> 00:29:04,409
And the second floor needs waxing again.

575
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:07,348
- We did wax.
- I like it shiny. I'll show you how.

576
00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:10,682
<i>Mrs. Hollander, will you please
remove this ironing board?</i>

577
00:29:10,754 --> 00:29:15,020
<i>Where should I go? If I go into
the kitchen, the chef starts to cry.</i>

578
00:29:15,092 --> 00:29:18,584
Dear Seth.

579
00:29:18,662 --> 00:29:23,065
Don't forget to wash...

580
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:26,500
behind your neck...

581
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,505
and ears.

582
00:29:29,573 --> 00:29:31,507
Here...

583
00:29:31,575 --> 00:29:35,739
all goes okay.

584
00:29:35,812 --> 00:29:38,178
Last night...

585
00:29:38,248 --> 00:29:42,048
for the first time in my life...

586
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:45,987
I ate sweetbreads.

587
00:29:46,056 --> 00:29:47,990
Also...

588
00:29:48,058 --> 00:29:51,186
<i>For the first time in my life...</i>

589
00:29:51,261 --> 00:29:56,062
I threw up on an antique carpet.

590
00:29:56,133 --> 00:29:58,328
We all miss you.

591
00:29:58,402 --> 00:30:01,132
<i>Overseas phone call for you, Mr. Hollander.</i>

592
00:30:01,204 --> 00:30:03,138
- Well, good.
- Mrs. Hollander.

593
00:30:03,206 --> 00:30:07,267
You're using the phone. Mr. Hollander's on
the phone. Susan is talking with Donald.

594
00:30:07,344 --> 00:30:10,609
All the incoming lines are
lit up with relatives calling.

595
00:30:10,681 --> 00:30:13,377
Uncle Saul, Minna, the Chomsky twins.

596
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,577
This embassy needs open lines.

597
00:30:15,652 --> 00:30:19,247
Sweetheart, could you put your mother
on for just one minute?

598
00:30:45,515 --> 00:30:49,110
Try and find out, and I'll call you back
in an hour. Love you. Thank you.

599
00:30:49,186 --> 00:30:51,154
<i>Sam Blackwell caters a sweet-sixteen
party. Listen to this.</i>

600
00:30:51,221 --> 00:30:53,781
I don't want to hear about this.

601
00:30:53,857 --> 00:30:56,325
- Tries to give a bargain on the meats.
- I'm not interested.

602
00:30:56,393 --> 00:30:58,732
He tries to buy cheap.
Doesn't use our regular guy.

603
00:30:58,745 --> 00:30:59,658
I'm not listening.

604
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:03,257
The result is four people go home from
the party, they get food poisoning.

605
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:04,194
Oh, my God.

606
00:31:04,207 --> 00:31:06,825
They're in the hospital 'cause
this guy looked to buy cheap.

607
00:31:06,903 --> 00:31:08,837
- I'll bet they're suing.
- Aha! Now you're interested.

608
00:31:08,905 --> 00:31:10,839
- Who are they?
- No, you don't want to hear.

609
00:31:10,907 --> 00:31:13,171
- Come on. Tell me.
- No! I'm not gonna say anything.

610
00:31:13,243 --> 00:31:15,177
- You weren't interested.
- All right, I'm not interested.

611
00:31:15,245 --> 00:31:17,338
You're not interested.
Why should I tell you?

612
00:31:17,414 --> 00:31:20,941
- Grouch. Will you answer me?
- No! You didn't want to know anything.

613
00:31:21,018 --> 00:31:22,952
Now I want to know. Tell me. Are they?

614
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,954
Are they suing? No, they're not suing.

615
00:31:25,022 --> 00:31:27,109
We're suing them for low
resistance to tainted meat.

616
00:31:27,122 --> 00:31:27,820
Walter!

617
00:31:27,891 --> 00:31:30,883
Of course they're suing! What do
you expect from poisoned people?

618
00:31:30,961 --> 00:31:32,024
Oh, my God.

619
00:31:32,037 --> 00:31:35,261
If I had Sam Blackwell here,
I would crush his head.

620
00:31:35,332 --> 00:31:37,266
Be thankful nobody died.

621
00:31:37,334 --> 00:31:39,768
Good, Marion. We're thinking
of making that our slogan.

622
00:31:42,305 --> 00:31:44,239
<i>- Hello?
- Got such a heartburn.</i>

623
00:31:44,307 --> 00:31:46,241
Yes. What? No.

624
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:49,278
Uh, yeah. Hold it. It's New Jersey. Sam.

625
00:31:49,346 --> 00:31:51,337
You be nice. We all make mistakes.

626
00:31:51,415 --> 00:31:53,576
Hello? Hello, cretin?

627
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:57,347
Hello, cretin?
Poison any more people, cretin?

628
00:31:58,989 --> 00:32:02,015
Four more people went.
They're dropping like flies.

629
00:32:02,092 --> 00:32:05,027
Uh-huh. So what's happening?
What did he say?

630
00:32:05,095 --> 00:32:07,120
Uh... Yeah. Good, good.

631
00:32:07,197 --> 00:32:09,995
The lawyer thinks they have a case.

632
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:12,194
Uh-huh. Murderer! Murderer!

633
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:14,362
When l... Oh. I can't hear you.

634
00:32:14,438 --> 00:32:16,906
Your voice is fading, murderer.

635
00:32:16,973 --> 00:32:19,669
Overseas operator,
I can't hear the murderer.

636
00:32:19,743 --> 00:32:23,304
I... Blackwell. Blackwell,
you're finished. You're finished.

637
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,474
When I come home, I'm gonna
rent a car and run you over.

638
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:30,850
You'll never cater again.
You've cut your last melon ball.

639
00:32:30,921 --> 00:32:32,855
His Majesty has arrived.

640
00:32:32,923 --> 00:32:35,687
Oh, my God... Allah. Uh...

641
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:37,989
Mr. Magee. Mr. Magee!

642
00:32:38,061 --> 00:32:40,188
<i>Don't call me. I've got problems of my own.</i>

643
00:32:40,263 --> 00:32:43,721
No. If you're gonna call,
call me with good news.

644
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,325
No... Black... Oh, my...

645
00:32:46,403 --> 00:32:49,270
Blackwell, I'll call you later.

646
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:51,273
<i>What is this? Lawrence of Arabia?</i>

647
00:32:51,341 --> 00:32:53,741
- How do you do, Your Highness?
- "Your Highness"?

648
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:54,498
You know this guy?

649
00:32:54,511 --> 00:32:56,574
What are you talking about?
He's some kind of a sultan.

650
00:32:56,646 --> 00:32:59,114
His Majesty wishes to thank
his American friends...

651
00:32:59,182 --> 00:33:01,912
for much recent generosity
and understanding.

652
00:33:01,985 --> 00:33:04,613
I am aide to His Majesty and his wives.

653
00:33:04,688 --> 00:33:07,851
- Wives. This bunch here is the wives?
- How do you do? How do you do?

654
00:33:07,924 --> 00:33:11,485
- Can I take your veils?
- I'm Walter Hollander from New Jersey.

655
00:33:11,561 --> 00:33:13,495
Our flight was a rather rough one.

656
00:33:13,563 --> 00:33:16,726
I hope you didn't have any problem
getting past all those police outside.

657
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,030
Walter and I are wanted.

658
00:33:19,102 --> 00:33:22,367
I recogn... This guy I recog...
The newspapers...

659
00:33:22,439 --> 00:33:24,373
Didn't you people
have an uprising recently?

660
00:33:24,441 --> 00:33:26,705
I understand the ambassador
has made arrangements.

661
00:33:26,776 --> 00:33:29,210
I'm right. All those workers got...

662
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,213
- There...
- All those workers got killed.

663
00:33:31,281 --> 00:33:33,272
There are two sides
to that affair, my friend.

664
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,978
What are you talking about, Walter?
Something you know nothing about?

665
00:33:36,052 --> 00:33:38,680
What are you telling me?
I don't know politics?

666
00:33:38,755 --> 00:33:42,816
Don't you read the papers? This guy
owns the most sand of anyone.

667
00:33:42,893 --> 00:33:44,827
- Your Highness.
- Majesty.

668
00:33:44,895 --> 00:33:47,728
Welcome, Your Majesty.
I'm sorry that we're unprepared.

669
00:33:47,797 --> 00:33:50,766
- We've had some problems.
- Problems of extreme rudeness?

670
00:33:50,834 --> 00:33:53,803
- What's your trouble, Aladdin?
- Mr. Hollander, leave this room immediately.

671
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:56,668
No, I'm not gonna go. Why?
'Cause this bum has some oil wells?

672
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,038
I'm an American citizen. I pay taxes.

673
00:33:59,109 --> 00:34:01,634
- You cheat on your taxes.
- What has that got to do with anything?

674
00:34:01,711 --> 00:34:04,305
Even with my cheating, I overpay.

675
00:34:04,381 --> 00:34:07,316
Your Excellency,
I'm Ambassador Magee's son.

676
00:34:07,384 --> 00:34:10,046
My father's crushed he has to be
in Washington while you're here...

677
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,418
but I'm chief executive officer
in his absence...

678
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:15,151
and I assure you that the entire embassy
is at your disposal.

679
00:34:15,225 --> 00:34:17,352
Listen, I don't want my government
doing business with this guy.

680
00:34:17,427 --> 00:34:19,912
I think your government
can decide that for itself.

681
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:20,988
I am the government!

682
00:34:21,064 --> 00:34:23,225
Listen to this. He's the government.

683
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,894
Who do you think the government is?
For crying out loud.

684
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:29,302
Our government is
little people like you and me.

685
00:34:29,372 --> 00:34:31,932
<i>- Maybe not you.
- - Perhaps we're intruding in a crisis.</i>

686
00:34:32,008 --> 00:34:34,841
<i>No, no. My father... Father Drobney!</i>

687
00:34:34,911 --> 00:34:37,243
<i>- I can't get out!
- Mr. Burns, extricate him.</i>

688
00:34:40,317 --> 00:34:42,683
<i>- How many wives does this guy have?
- You don't...</i>

689
00:34:42,752 --> 00:34:45,550
I count 14 wives. How does
he ever get in the bathroom?

690
00:34:45,622 --> 00:34:48,489
I don't know how Houdini did it!

691
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,534
I want it undone.

692
00:34:58,602 --> 00:35:00,900
I want amends made. I want him placated...

693
00:35:00,971 --> 00:35:03,565
and I don't want anything
to reach the press.

694
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,268
Axel, I knew it. I knew it.

695
00:35:06,343 --> 00:35:08,607
Yeah, but, Dad... Okay... Dad, no, no.

696
00:35:08,678 --> 00:35:11,579
No, I think it's been kept
pretty well under wraps.

697
00:35:13,283 --> 00:35:16,047
It is a crisis. No, it's a crisis...

698
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:21,250
but so far, it's our own private... crisis.

699
00:35:21,324 --> 00:35:23,849
God save your life if this becomes public.

700
00:35:23,927 --> 00:35:26,020
Any of it. Any of it! Do you hear me?

701
00:35:26,096 --> 00:35:29,657
The last thing I need is to be
on the front pages for the wrong thing.

702
00:35:29,733 --> 00:35:31,667
And, Axel.

703
00:35:31,735 --> 00:35:34,135
If relations with the emir
become compromised...

704
00:35:34,204 --> 00:35:36,604
I have friends at the Pentagon
who owe me a favor...

705
00:35:36,673 --> 00:35:39,699
and they will aim an ICBM at you.

706
00:35:39,776 --> 00:35:43,041
L-I appreciate that.

707
00:35:43,113 --> 00:35:45,047
Good-bye.

708
00:35:51,421 --> 00:35:53,355
Oh, hi.

709
00:35:53,423 --> 00:35:55,516
<i>- Hi.
- What have you got there? You hungry?</i>

710
00:35:55,592 --> 00:35:57,526
Oh, no. Actually, it's for my dad.

711
00:35:57,594 --> 00:36:01,428
He didn't eat dinner tonight.
The chef made squid.

712
00:36:01,498 --> 00:36:04,365
<i>- Yeah, I was just talking to my dad.
- Oh, really?</i>

713
00:36:04,434 --> 00:36:07,733
Yeah, he wants Mr. Kilroy
to take over for me.

714
00:36:07,804 --> 00:36:10,796
- That's not good. Is that what he said?
- Yeah.

715
00:36:10,874 --> 00:36:11,695
Oh.

716
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:14,207
And the fact that he regrets
having had intercourse...

717
00:36:14,277 --> 00:36:17,110
with my mother one particular night
many years ago.

718
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,444
Sorry to hear that.

719
00:36:19,516 --> 00:36:21,450
So how are you guys doing? You all right?

720
00:36:21,518 --> 00:36:23,884
I'm sorry. We're doing everything
we can to get you out of here.

721
00:36:23,953 --> 00:36:26,421
- Thanks. Thank you.
- The nicest people, you know?

722
00:36:26,489 --> 00:36:28,719
A lot of red tape.

723
00:36:28,792 --> 00:36:33,627
Actually, um, I've had the opportunity
to do a lot of soul searching.

724
00:36:33,697 --> 00:36:35,631
- Good.
- Yeah, it is good.

725
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:40,534
I've made a really big decision.
I've decided not to marry Donald.

726
00:36:40,603 --> 00:36:42,537
- You're kidding.
- Yeah. Do you believe it?

727
00:36:42,605 --> 00:36:45,301
How come?

728
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:47,309
I don't know. I mean,
it's not that I don't like him.

729
00:36:47,377 --> 00:36:49,743
He's a great guy. He's really brilliant.

730
00:36:49,813 --> 00:36:52,213
- A doctor. Yeah.
- He's gonna make a name for himself someday...

731
00:36:52,282 --> 00:36:54,944
in the area of hair transplants.

732
00:36:55,018 --> 00:36:59,580
It's fine for him, I just...
I don't know if it's for me.

733
00:36:59,656 --> 00:37:02,250
You don't need any.

734
00:37:04,527 --> 00:37:07,052
Seems like a hasty decision.

735
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,860
Well, I don't know. You think?

736
00:37:09,933 --> 00:37:12,231
I figure if I'm not 100% sure...

737
00:37:12,302 --> 00:37:14,184
This is the rest of my life
we're talking about, you know?

738
00:37:14,197 --> 00:37:14,827
That's true.

739
00:37:14,904 --> 00:37:18,806
Yeah. So I've already told Donald...

740
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:21,708
and now I just have to tell my parents.

741
00:37:21,778 --> 00:37:25,544
- You phoned him?
- Yeah, I phoned him, and I told him.

742
00:37:25,615 --> 00:37:27,549
- Wow.
- Yeah.

743
00:37:27,617 --> 00:37:29,847
Must have been crushed.

744
00:37:29,919 --> 00:37:33,946
I don't know. I'm not sure he wasn't
secretly relieved, you know?

745
00:37:34,023 --> 00:37:36,890
- I can't believe that.
- It's my father...

746
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,088
who's gonna have a heart attack
or a stroke when he finds out.

747
00:37:40,163 --> 00:37:42,495
- Something.
- He like Donald?

748
00:37:42,565 --> 00:37:44,726
Well, compared to the other guys
I've gone out with...

749
00:37:44,801 --> 00:37:49,670
I mean, Donald... He is.
He's the answer to a father's prayer.

750
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:52,606
- How many guys have you gone out with?
- Oh, just a few.

751
00:37:52,675 --> 00:37:57,009
You know. My father never really
appreciated my taste in men, you know?

752
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,207
The draft dodger, um...

753
00:37:59,282 --> 00:38:02,251
I went out with a Buddhist
ex-convict. He didn't like that.

754
00:38:02,318 --> 00:38:04,718
There was a manic-depressive
jazz musician. My mother loved him.

755
00:38:04,788 --> 00:38:07,256
But it's just my father.
He's hard to please.

756
00:38:07,323 --> 00:38:11,350
- He must really hate the suburbs.
- Yes and no.

757
00:38:11,428 --> 00:38:13,896
You know, um, a fortune-teller...

758
00:38:13,963 --> 00:38:16,431
actually once told me
that I'd meet the man...

759
00:38:16,499 --> 00:38:18,490
that I was gonna marry
under special circumstances.

760
00:38:18,568 --> 00:38:22,732
She just said that, and I said "What's
this special circumstance gonna be?"

761
00:38:22,806 --> 00:38:25,172
And... then at Trader Vic's...

762
00:38:25,241 --> 00:38:27,175
when Donald pulled the shrimp
out of my throat...

763
00:38:27,243 --> 00:38:30,303
I figured this is special,
so I thought it might be him.

764
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,905
You know? And, I don't know, call me crazy.

765
00:38:32,982 --> 00:38:36,213
Now I have this feeling it might be you.

766
00:38:36,286 --> 00:38:39,016
This from a person
who listens to fortune-tellers.

767
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:44,590
- Well... Me?
- You.

768
00:38:44,661 --> 00:38:47,255
Well, these are special circumstances.

769
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:51,323
Actually, the way I see it,
it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

770
00:38:51,401 --> 00:38:53,892
Less, if you're lucky.

771
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:56,461
I mean, you know,
the corniest movie writer...

772
00:38:56,539 --> 00:39:00,498
would never think of having two people
meet... in an embassy like this.

773
00:39:00,577 --> 00:39:03,045
- I never really thought about getting married.
- Here we are.

774
00:39:03,112 --> 00:39:05,046
I don't know if I'd be that good at it.

775
00:39:05,114 --> 00:39:09,073
Well, uh, do you believe
in fortune-tellers?

776
00:39:09,152 --> 00:39:13,612
I don't think so. 'Cause I saw
this one at a carnival once...

777
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,853
and she told me I was gonna
be the next Michelangelo.

778
00:39:16,926 --> 00:39:19,656
"The next Michelangelo."

779
00:39:19,729 --> 00:39:22,220
Didn't happen.

780
00:39:22,298 --> 00:39:25,927
Well, you're still young.
Maybe my fortune came true.

781
00:39:29,772 --> 00:39:32,468
<i>I'm goin'stir crazy.
I gotta get outta here, Marion.</i>

782
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:34,533
<i>Relax, Walter.</i>

783
00:39:34,611 --> 00:39:36,101
I wanna go to the country.

784
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:39,671
I wanna take a walk and see
the trees and smell the flowers.

785
00:39:39,749 --> 00:39:42,479
<i>- You hate the country.
- I can't stand it.</i>

786
00:39:42,552 --> 00:39:44,645
I miss the theater and the ballet.

787
00:39:44,721 --> 00:39:47,121
<i>We haven't gone to the theater
or ballet in 20 years.</i>

788
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:50,523
That's not the point. I can't see
any baseball. I can't get an egg roll.

789
00:39:50,593 --> 00:39:52,584
You know I'm lost without my urologist.

790
00:39:52,662 --> 00:39:55,597
<i>Calm yourself.
Do some more situps or something.</i>

791
00:39:55,665 --> 00:39:58,395
I can't. I'm seeing spots
in front of my eyes.

792
00:39:58,468 --> 00:40:01,699
<i>- That's 'cause we played dominoes.
- I'm sick of dominoes.</i>

793
00:40:01,771 --> 00:40:05,502
Last night I dreamt that I was
running down Times Square...

794
00:40:05,575 --> 00:40:07,634
completely naked, stark naked.

795
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:11,077
<i>- I was cool and free.
- Yeah? What happened?</i>

796
00:40:11,147 --> 00:40:13,980
What do you mean, "what happened"?
They arrested me.

797
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,314
They took me away,
put me in an institution.

798
00:40:16,386 --> 00:40:19,321
<i>Well, sure. Who tells you to run naked?</i>

799
00:40:19,389 --> 00:40:21,584
What is it your business what I do?

800
00:40:22,759 --> 00:40:25,853
Okay. I came with one balls.

801
00:40:25,929 --> 00:40:28,989
Now you're going to see
one ball, two balls...

802
00:40:29,065 --> 00:40:31,431
three balls, four balls!

803
00:40:32,936 --> 00:40:35,928
<i>Milk! Paper, paper does not hold milk.</i>

804
00:40:36,005 --> 00:40:38,371
Oh, but my paper will hold the milk.

805
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:40,375
Yes! Here we go.

806
00:40:40,443 --> 00:40:44,379
Okay. Milk is going. The milk is here.

807
00:40:44,447 --> 00:40:48,907
Well, cow, the milk is dear.
How about a nice big cheer?

808
00:40:58,995 --> 00:41:02,226
Ha! Yah! Okay, one.

809
00:41:02,298 --> 00:41:05,131
<i>And two and three.</i>

810
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:09,194
Now you see them, now... you don't.

811
00:41:10,273 --> 00:41:12,503
Just be careful...

812
00:41:12,575 --> 00:41:14,839
of the phone.

813
00:41:14,911 --> 00:41:16,879
Okay. One, two, three!

814
00:41:19,515 --> 00:41:22,882
<i>Yes, yes, the bird's coming.</i>

815
00:41:22,952 --> 00:41:26,752
Here comes the bird. Here comes the bird.

816
00:41:26,823 --> 00:41:29,291
Okay.

817
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,055
The magic words are simple.
One, two, three.

818
00:41:32,128 --> 00:41:35,791
Here comes the bird. Ah! It's...

819
00:41:37,033 --> 00:41:39,399
<i>Dear Seth.</i>

820
00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:43,462
<i>We're still stuck here.</i>

821
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:45,666
I'm okay.

822
00:41:45,742 --> 00:41:49,007
Your father... is showing...

823
00:41:49,078 --> 00:41:51,012
a little strain.

824
00:41:55,985 --> 00:41:58,613
No more snails. No more snails,
you understand?

825
00:41:58,688 --> 00:42:01,418
No snails, no tripe, no more aspic.

826
00:42:01,491 --> 00:42:07,088
No more aspic. No squid, no brains,
no horse meat. You got it?

827
00:42:07,163 --> 00:42:09,324
<i>"Dear Debbie.</i>

828
00:42:09,399 --> 00:42:13,301
<i>"In many ways I have found this to be
a very romantic place.</i>

829
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:15,860
<i>"Last night I happened to
doze off in the living room...</i>

830
00:42:15,938 --> 00:42:18,771
<i>"and when I awoke, Mr. Magee
was on the phone...</i>

831
00:42:18,841 --> 00:42:20,809
<i>and I overheard him. "</i>

832
00:42:20,877 --> 00:42:22,811
<i>Well, her, uh...</i>

833
00:42:22,879 --> 00:42:26,815
<i>Her name's Susan, and she's, uh...</i>

834
00:42:26,883 --> 00:42:29,579
really lovely.

835
00:42:29,652 --> 00:42:34,783
L... She's charming, she's sweet and, uh...

836
00:42:34,857 --> 00:42:38,816
I-I was... I wanted
to kiss her the other night.

837
00:42:38,895 --> 00:42:42,797
Her lips were chapped, and I didn't
want to cause her any pain.

838
00:42:42,865 --> 00:42:46,801
<i>Yeah. I'm really gonna
miss her when she's gone.</i>

839
00:42:49,338 --> 00:42:50,862
<i>Weeks go by...</i>

840
00:42:50,973 --> 00:42:54,067
<i>and through elaborate
behind-the-scenes negotiations...</i>

841
00:42:54,143 --> 00:42:56,077
<i>a spy trade is arranged.</i>

842
00:42:56,145 --> 00:42:59,114
Exchange. I won't hear of it!

843
00:42:59,182 --> 00:43:02,379
<i>The Hollanders for two top-level Soviets.</i>

844
00:43:02,452 --> 00:43:04,886
They leave tomorrow.

845
00:43:04,954 --> 00:43:07,650
Did you explain they're crucial to me?

846
00:43:07,724 --> 00:43:10,852
We believe them to be
a wealth of information...

847
00:43:10,927 --> 00:43:14,158
regarding disloyalty in our own ranks.

848
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:16,698
The interests of the Soviet Union...

849
00:43:16,766 --> 00:43:19,894
come before ours, comrade.

850
00:43:19,969 --> 00:43:21,960
Son, we're coming home today.

851
00:43:22,038 --> 00:43:24,302
<i>They arranged a trade.</i>

852
00:43:24,373 --> 00:43:26,534
<i>Yeah, well, we all miss you.</i>

853
00:43:26,609 --> 00:43:29,544
<i>I'll see you later today. Okay.</i>

854
00:43:32,248 --> 00:43:34,182
I called Donald last night.

855
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:37,686
You called Donald? Don't you
think that that's Susan's business?

856
00:43:37,754 --> 00:43:39,949
Why? Why should it be Susan's business?

857
00:43:40,022 --> 00:43:43,514
She neglects him, and he's gonna be
my future son-in-law.

858
00:43:43,593 --> 00:43:46,756
- Why shouldn't l... You know.
- What did he say?

859
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:48,820
He said nothing. He wasn't home.

860
00:43:48,898 --> 00:43:51,389
I got his answering service,
but that's class.

861
00:43:51,467 --> 00:43:53,458
Marion, that's class.
The man has a service.

862
00:43:53,536 --> 00:43:57,472
I called Barney Silverman.
He rented the station wagon again.

863
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,101
Yeah? Well, on the way home
from work, he can drop me.

864
00:44:01,177 --> 00:44:03,202
You're not coming home first?

865
00:44:03,279 --> 00:44:05,213
What do you mean? What for?

866
00:44:05,281 --> 00:44:07,977
You're going directly
from captivity to work?

867
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:11,281
- Why not? Why should...
- Are you crazy?

868
00:44:11,354 --> 00:44:14,016
What are you talking about? I'll help
you unpack when I come home at 7:00.

869
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,285
You haven't seen
our apartment in six weeks.

870
00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:18,384
So what? Who was there to change it?

871
00:44:18,461 --> 00:44:21,191
A man hasn't seen
his apartment in six weeks...

872
00:44:21,264 --> 00:44:23,232
he's going to work first?

873
00:44:23,299 --> 00:44:25,631
It's Thursday. I always work
on Thursday. It's a workday.

874
00:44:25,701 --> 00:44:28,329
- The business can't wait another day?
- Come on. Take a hike.

875
00:44:28,404 --> 00:44:31,965
- Leave me alone.
- Walter, if I cash in our mutual funds...

876
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:34,942
will you get mental help?

877
00:44:38,648 --> 00:44:41,811
Frank, why don't you go ahead,
take that down to the front.

878
00:44:41,884 --> 00:44:44,318
We'll be right there.

879
00:44:50,293 --> 00:44:53,421
I... feel like I've just, uh...

880
00:44:53,496 --> 00:44:55,987
got to know you, and now you're going.

881
00:44:56,065 --> 00:44:58,465
Well, yeah.

882
00:44:58,534 --> 00:45:01,298
You know, if you're ever in Newark,
you have my father's card.

883
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:04,601
You could always, I don't know, drop by.

884
00:45:04,674 --> 00:45:07,074
The way things are going, that...

885
00:45:07,143 --> 00:45:09,737
- could be my next career stop.
- I don't think so.

886
00:45:30,066 --> 00:45:32,261
<i>I can't understand you.</i>

887
00:45:32,335 --> 00:45:34,394
They've been so nice to us here.

888
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,995
How could you stick the towels
in your suitcase?

889
00:45:37,073 --> 00:45:39,871
I was a deprived child.
I told you. It's habit.

890
00:45:39,942 --> 00:45:42,308
- Give me...
- Oh, wonderful. Now he takes one.

891
00:45:42,378 --> 00:45:44,346
Are you sure it's safe to go out there?

892
00:45:44,413 --> 00:45:46,540
Mrs. Hollander, I assure you,
it's been carefully coordinated.

893
00:45:46,616 --> 00:45:49,176
Mr. Krojack will be with you
till the moment you board the plane.

894
00:45:49,252 --> 00:45:51,447
Did you take your hair dryer
our of Mr. Burns' office?

895
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,450
Did you hurt yourself?

896
00:45:52,463 --> 00:45:54,580
We came to say good-bye
and to wish you good luck.

897
00:45:54,657 --> 00:45:57,888
- It's a pity you're leaving.
- Well, look, if you ever need a job...

898
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,861
I know a lot of people in New Jersey
who'd appreciate your kind of cooking.

899
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,592
And don't worry about the Board of
Health, 'cause they'll never catch you.

900
00:46:03,666 --> 00:46:06,931
I may as well tell you, Mr. Hollander,
that the veal you had last night...

901
00:46:07,003 --> 00:46:09,995
was eel, and you cleaned your plate.

902
00:46:10,072 --> 00:46:13,599
Look in the vase
next to the dining room table.

903
00:46:13,676 --> 00:46:17,077
God bless you.
You have made my life richer.

904
00:46:17,146 --> 00:46:20,309
Pick a card.

905
00:46:20,383 --> 00:46:23,284
- Eight of diamonds.
- Look! They're all eight of diamonds!

906
00:46:23,352 --> 00:46:25,286
- So, of course, he gets it.
- Sue me.

907
00:46:25,354 --> 00:46:28,050
I think it's wonderful, Father,
that a man of the cloth...

908
00:46:28,124 --> 00:46:30,092
has a hobby besides just God.

909
00:46:32,728 --> 00:46:35,356
The exchange is a rather
complex one, Mr. Kilroy.

910
00:46:35,431 --> 00:46:37,490
Well, I appreciate your cooperation.

911
00:46:37,566 --> 00:46:40,000
I've contacted the Soviet embassy,
and as you know...

912
00:46:40,069 --> 00:46:43,630
they have a particular interest in the
return of Martin Tolchin as well as Pinchuk.

913
00:46:43,706 --> 00:46:45,731
- Right.
- I'll see you in a minute, Burns.

914
00:46:45,808 --> 00:46:47,935
Marion, look who's here. It's your friend.

915
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:50,535
I don't hold a grudge.
I'm just happy we're getting out.

916
00:46:50,613 --> 00:46:53,411
I'm... If you ask me,
the whole Cold War stinks, anyhow.

917
00:46:53,482 --> 00:46:55,387
His grandparents were Russian.
They loved Russia.

918
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,542
That's right. They loved it.

919
00:46:56,619 --> 00:46:59,019
They only got out because they heard
there was gonna be a pogrom...

920
00:46:59,088 --> 00:47:01,056
and they had just purchased new dishes.

921
00:47:01,123 --> 00:47:05,287
- Let bygones be bygones.
- If I could have my way...

922
00:47:05,361 --> 00:47:07,329
<i>you and all those like you...</i>

923
00:47:07,396 --> 00:47:09,762
would hang in the public square...

924
00:47:09,832 --> 00:47:12,960
as an example to all
the enemies of the state.

925
00:47:13,035 --> 00:47:15,230
Say, listen, mister,
when was the last time...

926
00:47:15,304 --> 00:47:17,363
you propositioned a woman and she said yes?

927
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,603
You will be jointly
accompanied to the airport...

928
00:47:20,676 --> 00:47:22,610
and safely put on the plane.

929
00:47:22,678 --> 00:47:25,738
Well, here. Take my phone number
in New Jersey.

930
00:47:25,815 --> 00:47:29,182
If you ever decide to defect, call me
'cause we can always use busboys.

931
00:47:29,251 --> 00:47:31,845
<i>Mr. Krojack, you have a telephone call.</i>

932
00:47:31,921 --> 00:47:35,880
The trade is off. Tolchin's a suicide.

933
00:47:35,958 --> 00:47:38,119
Wait. Do they know that here?

934
00:47:41,931 --> 00:47:44,126
If the Hollanders have left
the building, get 'em back.

935
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,226
Quickly. And don't create suspicion.

936
00:47:47,303 --> 00:47:49,965
Ah!

937
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:51,973
Fresh air. I can't believe it.

938
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:54,032
Even Communist air is better than no air.

939
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:56,044
- Oh, uh...
- What?

940
00:47:56,112 --> 00:47:58,171
- You know, I, uh...
- You have everything?

941
00:47:58,247 --> 00:48:00,647
No, I don't know if I packed that thing.
You know, the...

942
00:48:00,716 --> 00:48:02,581
- The adaptor?
- Yeah, the adaptor.

943
00:48:02,651 --> 00:48:05,085
- You didn't take the adaptor?
- No, and it's Mildred's. I borrowed it.

944
00:48:05,154 --> 00:48:07,349
Mrs. Hollander, can I ask you
to wait inside one second?

945
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:10,449
I know you're anxious but... Mr.
Hollander, you forgot something inside.

946
00:48:10,526 --> 00:48:13,154
- She forgot the adaptor.
- No, actually, we, uh...

947
00:48:13,229 --> 00:48:16,164
We have your passports,
Mr. Hollander. We have your passports.

948
00:48:16,232 --> 00:48:20,760
No, you're wrong because I got them from
Kilroy 'cause I knew you would forget.

949
00:48:20,836 --> 00:48:24,636
Please, Mr. Hollander. Just one second.
Did you sign our guest book?

950
00:48:24,707 --> 00:48:28,234
No, I'm never going back into that dump.
I've had it. I'm going home.

951
00:48:30,746 --> 00:48:32,680
<i>No, no, no, run!</i>

952
00:48:34,784 --> 00:48:37,378
Back! Get back! Get back!

953
00:48:40,623 --> 00:48:44,218
No, no, no, no, no! Up, up, up, up, up.

954
00:48:44,293 --> 00:48:46,227
I'm gonna blow your brains out if you move.

955
00:48:46,295 --> 00:48:48,525
- You're bluffing.
- I'm bluffing am I?

956
00:48:48,597 --> 00:48:50,531
Why don't you try calling it?

957
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:53,466
You fool! That's a finger.

958
00:48:53,536 --> 00:48:56,562
It may look like a finger,
but it's a flesh-colored.45...

959
00:48:56,639 --> 00:49:00,473
- with two joints, a knuckle
and a little hair.

960
00:49:00,543 --> 00:49:04,673
They committed suicide!
The ones they were gonna trade us for.

961
00:49:04,747 --> 00:49:07,682
They had to do it...
This morning they had to pick to do it.

962
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:10,412
<i>- Where do you want these?
- They couldn't wait till the weekend.</i>

963
00:49:10,486 --> 00:49:12,954
It's gonna be a beautiful weekend.
They could have gotten it all in.

964
00:49:13,022 --> 00:49:16,685
See? And you wanted to rush to work.

965
00:49:16,759 --> 00:49:18,693
I gotta call Barney Silverman.

966
00:49:18,761 --> 00:49:20,888
- I'm drowsy, Marion.
- You're drowsy?

967
00:49:20,963 --> 00:49:24,228
I took a Dramamine.
It's a half-hour before the flight.

968
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,463
What are you lookin' at? I'm drowsy.

969
00:49:27,536 --> 00:49:31,131
I gotta get some coffee.

970
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:35,134
Do you believe it? Here we are again.

971
00:49:47,756 --> 00:49:49,781
<i>There's something you should know. Uh...</i>

972
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:53,158
I called Donald.
I told him the wedding's off.

973
00:49:53,229 --> 00:49:56,426
<i>You did?</i>

974
00:49:56,499 --> 00:50:00,560
- I'm not sure I heard that correctly.
- She's not marrying Donald!

975
00:50:02,404 --> 00:50:06,101
Don't make jokes with me,
because I can't take jokes, Marion.

976
00:50:06,175 --> 00:50:08,643
I was up all last night.
I didn't sleep a wink.

977
00:50:08,711 --> 00:50:12,078
The emir's aide sneezed on me. I have
camel germs coming out of everything.

978
00:50:12,148 --> 00:50:14,912
I'm not joking with you.
I'm not marrying Donald.

979
00:50:17,887 --> 00:50:21,584
<i>- Why not?
- Because she's not in love with him.</i>

980
00:50:21,657 --> 00:50:25,184
- What do you mean, you're not marrying Donald?
- I'm not in love with him.

981
00:50:25,261 --> 00:50:27,729
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not in love with him.

982
00:50:27,796 --> 00:50:31,493
- And I'm talking to her.
- So listen to her.

983
00:50:31,567 --> 00:50:34,035
What do you mean you're not?
How can you not marry him?

984
00:50:34,103 --> 00:50:36,765
I don't know.
Maybe I never was in love with him.

985
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:40,070
What do you mean you weren't? The man
got her an expensive electric razor.

986
00:50:40,142 --> 00:50:42,110
- How could you not be in love with him?
- Dad, I'm mixed up.

987
00:50:42,178 --> 00:50:44,112
Don't confuse me more.

988
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:46,410
You have to marry him.
You're in love with him.

989
00:50:46,482 --> 00:50:49,076
<i>No, Walter. You're in love with him.</i>

990
00:50:49,151 --> 00:50:51,881
I never said I wasn't. So what?

991
00:50:51,954 --> 00:50:55,515
If he was a female dermatologist,
you'd be sharing a flat in Paris.

992
00:50:55,591 --> 00:50:57,889
Oh! How can you do this?

993
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,157
I don't know. I don't know.
He's not romantic enough.

994
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:03,323
Since... I find him very romantic.

995
00:51:03,399 --> 00:51:06,459
- To you, not her.
- You're not the one he's holding in his arms.

996
00:51:06,535 --> 00:51:08,793
So if I let him hold me in
his arms, you'll marry him?

997
00:51:08,806 --> 00:51:09,561
No.

998
00:51:09,638 --> 00:51:12,630
Dad, no. It's over. Okay? It's over.

999
00:51:12,708 --> 00:51:14,835
Listen to her. What... How...

1000
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:17,378
How is he not romantic?
The man is a derma...

1001
00:51:17,446 --> 00:51:19,971
What could be more romantic
than a dermatologist?

1002
00:51:20,049 --> 00:51:22,244
It's skin. He's a skin doctor.

1003
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:24,843
The very words
of his profession are romantic.

1004
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,445
Nevus. Rosacea.

1005
00:51:27,523 --> 00:51:30,617
Leukoplakia. It's like Hawaiian.
It evokes the tropics.

1006
00:51:30,693 --> 00:51:33,127
Walter, forget it.
Leave her alone. All right?

1007
00:51:33,195 --> 00:51:35,129
It's... You know...

1008
00:51:35,197 --> 00:51:39,327
This is our only daughter,
suddenly abandoned with child.

1009
00:51:39,401 --> 00:51:41,426
She's heavy with child...

1010
00:51:41,503 --> 00:51:43,994
I'm not with child!
What are you talking about?

1011
00:51:44,073 --> 00:51:46,405
What do you mean? You're not with child?

1012
00:51:46,475 --> 00:51:48,875
- I'm not with child.
- Since when are you not with child?

1013
00:51:48,944 --> 00:51:52,641
- She's never been with child.
- Where'd I get the impression she was with child?

1014
00:51:52,715 --> 00:51:55,775
I don't know. Maybe
you're thinking of your sister.

1015
00:51:55,851 --> 00:51:58,285
- My sister's with child?
- Yes, I told you. I was on the phone.

1016
00:51:58,354 --> 00:52:00,788
She told me. She's with child.

1017
00:52:00,856 --> 00:52:02,790
So we'll have to get her something.

1018
00:52:02,858 --> 00:52:05,224
I don't know what we're
going to get her around here.

1019
00:52:05,294 --> 00:52:07,558
- How do you get a baby gift...
- We'll get it at the duty free shop.

1020
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:11,088
By the time we get to a duty free shop,
the kid's gonna be in college.

1021
00:52:11,166 --> 00:52:14,693
You should still marry Donald.
What's the difference? So you'll adopt.

1022
00:52:16,672 --> 00:52:21,041
I need you to clear up rumors
that all is not well at your embassy.

1023
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:23,044
No, no, that's not true at all.

1024
00:52:23,112 --> 00:52:25,979
I heard there's been
some kind of a crisis...

1025
00:52:26,048 --> 00:52:29,506
where American spies have been
uncovered by the Reds?

1026
00:52:29,585 --> 00:52:32,748
If there's any spying being done,
it's being done on their side.

1027
00:52:32,821 --> 00:52:35,334
All goes very well there.
They're very happy there.

1028
00:52:35,347 --> 00:52:36,188
All righty.

1029
00:52:36,258 --> 00:52:38,192
If you'll excuse me, I'm in a hurry.

1030
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:40,854
- Good to see you.
- Okay, thanks a lot. Bye-bye now.

1031
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:43,159
Your Royal Highness, can you feel that?

1032
00:52:43,232 --> 00:52:45,462
- Can you move your toes?
- What are you doing?

1033
00:52:45,534 --> 00:52:48,025
- It's broken.
- Well, then, don't touch it. Don't move it!

1034
00:52:48,103 --> 00:52:51,266
- I won't. No, no, no.
- He shouldn't walk there. I just waxed!

1035
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,274
Well, I wish you'd quit waxing everything.

1036
00:52:53,342 --> 00:52:55,276
I'm holding you responsible for this.

1037
00:52:55,344 --> 00:52:57,437
<i>The United States government
is extremely sorry about this.</i>

1038
00:52:57,513 --> 00:52:58,832
Sorry is not gonna help!

1039
00:52:58,845 --> 00:53:01,609
We have a very fine doctor
on staff from Bulgaria.

1040
00:53:01,684 --> 00:53:06,246
Well, uh, Dad, unfortunately
His Highness had a little accident.

1041
00:53:06,322 --> 00:53:10,383
No, it was nothing terrible.
He bro-broke his leg.

1042
00:53:12,561 --> 00:53:16,964
L-I don't know what to do. I ask her,
she just keeps waxing the floors.

1043
00:53:17,032 --> 00:53:19,899
Mr. Kilroy is now in full charge.

1044
00:53:19,968 --> 00:53:21,936
I want the Hollanders out of the embassy.

1045
00:53:22,004 --> 00:53:24,996
Do you understand, Axel? O-U-T, out!

1046
00:53:25,074 --> 00:53:28,066
Yesterday I had to dodge
embarrassing questions by Dean Rusk.

1047
00:53:28,143 --> 00:53:30,077
Someone even used the word "cover-up."

1048
00:53:30,145 --> 00:53:33,239
I will not have my life
sabotaged by a caterer.

1049
00:53:33,315 --> 00:53:36,216
<i>Well, sir, short of turning
them over to the Reds...</i>

1050
00:53:36,285 --> 00:53:38,219
I don't see a way out.

1051
00:53:38,287 --> 00:53:40,346
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

1052
00:53:40,422 --> 00:53:42,447
Axel...

1053
00:53:42,524 --> 00:53:46,688
there are certain tribes
that practice infanticide.

1054
00:53:46,762 --> 00:53:50,596
That is, if the child
is found to be defective...

1055
00:53:50,666 --> 00:53:52,600
the father has the right...

1056
00:53:52,668 --> 00:53:55,296
even the duty... to kill his son.

1057
00:53:55,371 --> 00:53:59,137
<i>Sir, I can't hear you. There's
some kind of a ruckus outside.</i>

1058
00:53:59,208 --> 00:54:01,540
<i>Um, can l... Can I call you back?</i>

1059
00:54:11,954 --> 00:54:15,651
All of a sudden, it's good-bye
successful dermatologist...

1060
00:54:15,724 --> 00:54:17,589
hello psychotic diplomat.

1061
00:54:17,659 --> 00:54:19,923
It's her own life, Walter. She's 21!

1062
00:54:19,995 --> 00:54:23,123
Marion, this guy is what we used
to call in the poolroom a "loser."

1063
00:54:23,198 --> 00:54:25,723
- He's a Harvard graduate!
- Because his father gives money.

1064
00:54:25,801 --> 00:54:29,635
- That's how he graduated. But he's a loser.
- Walter, don't get involved.

1065
00:54:29,705 --> 00:54:33,539
Of all her prospects over the years,
this is the single worst.

1066
00:54:33,609 --> 00:54:35,702
I prefer every one to him.

1067
00:54:35,778 --> 00:54:38,713
Even the draft dodger was better,
because he at least was a success.

1068
00:54:38,781 --> 00:54:40,715
He beat the draft. Something.

1069
00:54:40,783 --> 00:54:43,718
She was always a little lukewarm
about Donald, I felt.

1070
00:54:43,786 --> 00:54:47,745
<i>I didn't want to say anything, 'cause...</i>

1071
00:54:47,823 --> 00:54:50,053
<i>Hey, what are you doing with the stove?</i>

1072
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:52,389
<i>Is this a stove?</i>

1073
00:54:52,461 --> 00:54:54,895
<i>It's a porcelain-tiled stove.</i>

1074
00:54:54,963 --> 00:54:57,397
<i>You think Europe has central heating?</i>

1075
00:54:57,466 --> 00:54:59,400
<i>I've been mailing letters in it.</i>

1076
00:54:59,468 --> 00:55:01,402
<i>Walter, come here.</i>

1077
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:03,404
<i>Look what's going on!</i>

1078
00:55:03,472 --> 00:55:06,805
- Oh, Jesus, be careful.
- Rocks. They're throwing rocks!

1079
00:55:06,875 --> 00:55:08,968
Away from the window. Away. Down, down.

1080
00:55:09,044 --> 00:55:11,979
There was a small riot. If you
could please just go to your room.

1081
00:55:12,047 --> 00:55:14,140
- Quickly, go. Go.
- Aah. What do we do?

1082
00:55:14,216 --> 00:55:17,049
- Go to your room. Run!
- Try not to get shot.

1083
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:21,453
Maybe you should go outside and address
them. You took a public speaking course.

1084
00:55:21,523 --> 00:55:24,822
<i>- Should have gone to Atlantic Beach.
- Oh, again with Atlantic Beach.</i>

1085
00:55:24,893 --> 00:55:28,693
All wives to the basement!
All wives, this way.

1086
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:34,158
Get your valuables. Get all your valuables.

1087
00:55:34,236 --> 00:55:36,227
<i>I got 'em. Look at this!</i>

1088
00:55:36,305 --> 00:55:39,832
- Where's Susan?
- Get away from the windows.

1089
00:55:39,908 --> 00:55:43,071
- Get away from...
- Where's Susan?

1090
00:55:43,145 --> 00:55:43,773
<i>Oh, Susan!</i>

1091
00:55:43,786 --> 00:55:45,705
<i>Thank God. Kilroy got hit
in the head with a brick.</i>

1092
00:55:45,781 --> 00:55:49,376
- He's lying downstairs muttering something...
- God! Don't touch that.

1093
00:55:49,451 --> 00:55:51,385
It's an explosive!

1094
00:55:51,453 --> 00:55:53,387
- This is a bo...
- No, no. Don't put it down.

1095
00:55:53,455 --> 00:55:55,480
<i>- The slightest tap could blow us sky-high.</i>

1096
00:55:55,557 --> 00:55:57,491
My God, it's the emir!

1097
00:55:57,559 --> 00:56:01,154
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

1098
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:03,164
Okay, let's get him in the basement.

1099
00:56:03,232 --> 00:56:05,166
Everybody, just stay calm.

1100
00:56:05,234 --> 00:56:08,795
Stay away from the windows. Everybody
stay low. Not you, Your Majesty.

1101
00:56:08,871 --> 00:56:10,839
- Walter, don't move! Hold on.
- Just stay still, okay?

1102
00:56:10,906 --> 00:56:13,841
I'm calm, I'm calm. Who's Walter?

1103
00:56:13,909 --> 00:56:17,845
<i>Move as quickly and as surely as...</i>

1104
00:56:17,913 --> 00:56:20,143
Oh, Your Majesty...

1105
00:56:20,215 --> 00:56:22,581
Try not to shake! If you shake,
it could make it go off...

1106
00:56:22,651 --> 00:56:25,381
- Just relax. Everybody relax.
- It's still ticking!

1107
00:56:25,454 --> 00:56:27,388
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

1108
00:56:27,456 --> 00:56:29,617
I'm a highly trained professional.

1109
00:56:29,691 --> 00:56:31,625
- Don't shake him!
- He's shaking.

1110
00:56:31,693 --> 00:56:34,389
- Just hold on to me. Okay, shh!
- Shh!

1111
00:56:34,463 --> 00:56:37,023
You're turning it the wrong way.
Get out of the room!

1112
00:56:37,099 --> 00:56:39,158
- Take her and go! Don't worry about me.
- What about you?

1113
00:56:39,234 --> 00:56:41,464
Look out the window, you'll see me
passing over the building.

1114
00:56:41,537 --> 00:56:43,471
We're not gonna leave you, Walter.

1115
00:56:43,539 --> 00:56:46,099
I can't cook with this going on.
A rock just landed in my chocolate...

1116
00:56:46,174 --> 00:56:48,802
<i>- It's not my fault.
- Don't you see what's going on here?</i>

1117
00:56:48,877 --> 00:56:52,278
<i>Don't move!</i>

1118
00:56:52,347 --> 00:56:55,248
- It's ticking. You have three seconds!
- Here we go, here we go.

1119
00:56:55,317 --> 00:56:57,512
- Ow!
- It's dead.

1120
00:56:58,854 --> 00:57:01,448
- My hair turned gray.
- Walter...

1121
00:57:01,523 --> 00:57:03,855
Marion, my bald spot is gray, I think.

1122
00:57:03,926 --> 00:57:08,761
Oh, Walter. Who tells you
to pick up strange objects?

1123
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:10,821
- That's how we met.
- Ach.

1124
00:57:10,899 --> 00:57:14,995
- Has anyone been hurt?
- Uh, no, I think we're okay. How's everyone else?

1125
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:17,766
Mr. Kilroy, downstairs, got
hit in the head with a brick.

1126
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:20,330
He must have a concussion.
He thinks he's the Wright brothers.

1127
00:57:20,409 --> 00:57:23,469
The Wright brothers. Okay,
file a complaint with the ministry.

1128
00:57:23,545 --> 00:57:25,479
And you better call Washington.

1129
00:57:25,547 --> 00:57:27,777
No, no! Don't call Washington.
Just remain calm.

1130
00:57:27,849 --> 00:57:29,874
Just everybody remain calm.

1131
00:57:29,952 --> 00:57:32,648
- A bomb! I'm okay. I know the bomb.
- It was a bomb.

1132
00:57:32,721 --> 00:57:35,281
"Do what?" "Get that machine to fly."

1133
00:57:35,357 --> 00:57:37,791
- "Well, you're crazy." "Yes, but so are you."
- Mr. Burns!

1134
00:57:37,859 --> 00:57:40,760
<i>- Sir?
- You better get Mr. Kilroy to his room.</i>

1135
00:57:40,829 --> 00:57:42,763
- We may have to get him to a hospital.
- "What if something goes wrong?"

1136
00:57:42,831 --> 00:57:45,356
- You better get him twin beds.
- "Stop arguing."

1137
00:57:45,434 --> 00:57:47,425
<i>- Who here wants their laundry done?
- All right, okay.</i>

1138
00:57:47,502 --> 00:57:50,562
In the absence of any superiors,
I am now in charge of this embassy.

1139
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:53,335
I'm in complete control of everything.

1140
00:57:53,408 --> 00:57:56,741
Good, now I feel safe, because
I heard him say he was in control.

1141
00:57:56,812 --> 00:57:59,110
- Go, better help the Russians.
- Axel?

1142
00:57:59,181 --> 00:58:00,042
Yeah.

1143
00:58:00,055 --> 00:58:02,673
They're not safe here.
That's what this is about.

1144
00:58:02,751 --> 00:58:05,652
- Mr. Kilroy? Mr. Kilroy?
- No! Wait, no.

1145
00:58:08,757 --> 00:58:13,558
Okay, nothing up my sleeve.
Right? One, two, three...

1146
00:58:13,629 --> 00:58:16,325
Here you...

1147
00:58:16,398 --> 00:58:18,764
- Is this good?
- What are you going to do with that?

1148
00:58:18,834 --> 00:58:20,927
- Just watch. Okay.
- L-I like this tie, Father.

1149
00:58:21,003 --> 00:58:23,904
Me, too. One of my favorites.

1150
00:58:23,972 --> 00:58:27,635
I place here a magic ladybug.

1151
00:58:27,709 --> 00:58:30,177
"Ladybug, ladybug, light as a feather...

1152
00:58:30,245 --> 00:58:32,907
make this tie all together."

1153
00:58:32,981 --> 00:58:35,415
So.

1154
00:58:35,484 --> 00:58:38,749
Okay. All right.

1155
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:49,354
Okay. Okay... Oh, oh, oh, Mr. Magee!
One moment, please.

1156
00:58:49,431 --> 00:58:53,197
- Father, I'm a little busy right now...
- Very serious, please!

1157
00:58:53,268 --> 00:58:55,361
Okay.

1158
00:58:55,437 --> 00:58:57,701
- Okay.
- Father, what about my tie?

1159
00:58:57,773 --> 00:59:00,333
The reason this did not work
is because I'm still learning.

1160
00:59:00,409 --> 00:59:03,742
But God bless you.
God bless you, and good luck.

1161
00:59:03,812 --> 00:59:05,746
Okay.

1162
00:59:07,382 --> 00:59:11,113
<i>Our friends the Hollanders are in danger!</i>

1163
00:59:11,186 --> 00:59:13,586
That's what you came here to tell me,
Father? I'm aware of that.

1164
00:59:13,655 --> 00:59:16,283
No, no, no, no. Great danger.
I have information...

1165
00:59:16,358 --> 00:59:19,759
that the secret police intend
to kidnap them from this embassy.

1166
00:59:19,828 --> 00:59:21,762
Th-That's one thing
I'm not worried about...

1167
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:24,492
because there are rules of
diplomatic protocol that preclude...

1168
00:59:24,566 --> 00:59:26,500
Please, you're dealing with the Communists.

1169
00:59:26,568 --> 00:59:28,763
They don't believe in God,
they eat too much fat...

1170
00:59:28,837 --> 00:59:30,805
and they, oh, share bathrooms.

1171
00:59:30,872 --> 00:59:32,806
We're trying everything.

1172
00:59:32,874 --> 00:59:35,240
Everything means nothing if
the Communists don't cooperate.

1173
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:37,369
Mm-mm.

1174
00:59:37,446 --> 00:59:41,849
Listen. Listen to me.
I have decided. They must escape.

1175
00:59:41,917 --> 00:59:43,851
- Escape?
- Mm-hmm.

1176
00:59:43,919 --> 00:59:47,514
- All due respect, Father, but are you nuts?
- No, not nuts.

1177
00:59:47,589 --> 00:59:49,523
This is their only chance for survival.

1178
00:59:49,591 --> 00:59:52,583
No, we'll get more marines in here.
We'll pack the embassy.

1179
00:59:52,661 --> 00:59:54,788
For how long? For five years, ten years?

1180
00:59:54,863 --> 00:59:57,832
- Twelve years? Forget about it.
- Look, escape is not possible.

1181
00:59:57,899 --> 01:00:00,993
Uh, Houdini escaped.

1182
01:00:01,069 --> 01:00:04,197
This is not Houdini.
This is a man who carves...

1183
01:00:04,272 --> 01:00:06,206
bridegrooms out of potato salad.

1184
01:00:06,274 --> 01:00:09,334
Listen to me, I have information.
I have connections.

1185
01:00:09,411 --> 01:00:11,345
With the underground!

1186
01:00:11,413 --> 01:00:14,314
With loyal patriots who will
take them to safety, to America.

1187
01:00:14,382 --> 01:00:16,646
- Please!
- How are you gonna get them to America?

1188
01:00:16,718 --> 01:00:19,482
- We can't get 'em out of the embassy.
- Okay.

1189
01:00:19,554 --> 01:00:22,216
I will show you an example.
Give me one shoe.

1190
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:24,588
- What?
- Give me one shoe!

1191
01:00:24,659 --> 01:00:26,593
- My shoe? No.
- Mm-hmm.

1192
01:00:26,661 --> 01:00:28,595
- Please!
- I'm not... No, I'm not gonna...

1193
01:00:28,663 --> 01:00:30,597
- A shoe. One shoe.
- Why do you need my shoe?

1194
01:00:30,665 --> 01:00:33,429
Give me one shoe!

1195
01:00:33,502 --> 01:00:35,493
This is...

1196
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:38,164
- This is... I really don't have time for this.
- Thank you.

1197
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,367
Please observe. Watch. Look.

1198
01:00:40,442 --> 01:00:42,876
Okay, I take one eggs.

1199
01:00:42,944 --> 01:00:45,936
I place the eggs inside the shoe.

1200
01:00:46,014 --> 01:00:50,075
Okay, now. I take the wand, and I place...

1201
01:00:53,722 --> 01:00:55,781
- Apprehensive?
- No, I'm not apprehensive, Father.

1202
01:00:55,857 --> 01:00:58,223
Because I saw the egg went up your sleeve.

1203
01:00:58,293 --> 01:01:01,091
Wrong. Listen to me. Look!

1204
01:01:01,163 --> 01:01:04,860
Okey-dokey. Misdirection.

1205
01:01:04,933 --> 01:01:08,460
And misdirection is how
we will get the Hollanders...

1206
01:01:08,537 --> 01:01:11,370
out of this embassy.

1207
01:01:11,439 --> 01:01:13,839
Understand?

1208
01:01:13,909 --> 01:01:16,139
Thank you.

1209
01:01:16,211 --> 01:01:19,374
Congratulations, it's a double yolk.

1210
01:01:19,447 --> 01:01:22,439
That's good luck! Oh!

1211
01:01:22,517 --> 01:01:24,246
<i>This is a good plan.</i>

1212
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:26,947
<i>I can't agree. You'll all get killed!</i>

1213
01:01:27,022 --> 01:01:28,956
We'll get killed if we stay here!

1214
01:01:29,024 --> 01:01:31,424
I can't believe how much
I've screwed this up already.

1215
01:01:31,493 --> 01:01:35,156
<i>- You have not messed this up.
- My father's right. I'm a failure.</i>

1216
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:37,164
And your father said it too.

1217
01:01:37,232 --> 01:01:40,793
And it's not just fathers. Lots of mothers
and brothers and sisters have said it.

1218
01:01:40,869 --> 01:01:41,773
Cousins, uncles...

1219
01:01:41,786 --> 01:01:44,532
First of all, you've got to
stop being so hard on yourself.

1220
01:01:44,606 --> 01:01:47,575
A lot of famous men had rough starts.
Hitler flunked out of art school.

1221
01:01:47,642 --> 01:01:49,735
- Thanks, Susan. That's very comforting.
- No, look.

1222
01:01:49,811 --> 01:01:53,645
- I see something wonderful in you.
- Your father can't do this!

1223
01:01:53,715 --> 01:01:56,309
<i>It's not pretty, a man with a hernia
being chased by a tank.</i>

1224
01:01:56,384 --> 01:01:58,318
<i>Will you forget my father for a minute?</i>

1225
01:01:58,386 --> 01:02:00,820
<i>If we never get out ofhere, how are
we going to have a future together?</i>

1226
01:02:00,889 --> 01:02:03,187
<i>- You don't want a future with me.
- How do you know?</i>

1227
01:02:03,258 --> 01:02:05,192
<i>It's not fun, the wife
of a career diplomat.</i>

1228
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:08,058
Especially one who spends most of his life
in the unemployment insurance office.

1229
01:02:08,129 --> 01:02:12,065
We've got to tell my parents about this.
That's gonna be the hard part.

1230
01:02:12,133 --> 01:02:14,966
- Is it your turn?
- No, it's your turn. It's been ten minutes.

1231
01:02:15,036 --> 01:02:18,164
Mom, Dad, do you have a minute?
Axel has something he needs to tell you.

1232
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,174
No more Donald. Now it's Axel.

1233
01:02:20,242 --> 01:02:22,767
She needs this hysteric
like a hole in the head.

1234
01:02:22,844 --> 01:02:28,407
- What does the failure have to tell us?
- Dad! Go ahead, darling.

1235
01:02:28,483 --> 01:02:31,543
Mr. Hollander, in light
of the circumstances...

1236
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:33,611
and after much consideration...

1237
01:02:33,688 --> 01:02:36,350
well, I feel this situation
calls for drastic action.

1238
01:02:36,424 --> 01:02:39,552
The transplant guy was not
good enough? It has to be...

1239
01:02:39,628 --> 01:02:42,654
Let's just say, for purposes of
argument, that you were trapped spies.

1240
01:02:42,731 --> 01:02:43,909
What would you do?

1241
01:02:43,922 --> 01:02:47,430
I would deny it and claim
to be a caterer. Okay, happy?

1242
01:02:47,502 --> 01:02:50,562
- It's your turn!
- You've read the papers. What do families do...

1243
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:52,664
when they're caught
behind the Berlin Wall...

1244
01:02:52,741 --> 01:02:57,440
and they desperately want freedom...
so desperately their lives depend on it?

1245
01:02:57,512 --> 01:02:59,980
What do they do? They escape.
They jump over the Wall.

1246
01:03:00,048 --> 01:03:03,017
They run through roadblocks.
They shoot. They forge pass...

1247
01:03:03,084 --> 01:03:05,279
Yeah.

1248
01:03:05,353 --> 01:03:08,948
Magee, it's been wonderful chatting
with you. Any other psychotic notions...

1249
01:03:09,024 --> 01:03:11,185
- We're playing dominoes.
- I'm afraid it's the only answer.

1250
01:03:11,259 --> 01:03:13,659
Escape? What an interesting idea.

1251
01:03:13,728 --> 01:03:16,959
What are you talking about? He's insane!

1252
01:03:17,032 --> 01:03:19,796
Years of insanity have made this guy crazy.

1253
01:03:19,868 --> 01:03:22,302
Dad, would you please just hear him out?
He's come into possession...

1254
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:24,304
of some very alarming information.

1255
01:03:24,372 --> 01:03:27,466
- Did he get the results of his I.Q. Test back?
- We have reason to believe...

1256
01:03:27,542 --> 01:03:30,739
that the secret police are
planning to have you eliminated.

1257
01:03:30,812 --> 01:03:35,442
- Eliminated from what? We didn't enter anything.
- Walter, just hear him out!

1258
01:03:35,517 --> 01:03:38,816
Marion, I'm not an escaper.
It's not my style.

1259
01:03:38,887 --> 01:03:41,447
- I show up at a place and I stay.
- You can't stay.

1260
01:03:41,523 --> 01:03:44,424
- You're not safe here.
- But the priest is safe, right?

1261
01:03:44,492 --> 01:03:47,325
- Six years he's living upstairs...
- You wanna stay here for six years?

1262
01:03:47,395 --> 01:03:49,704
He's a relic of an old regime.
Krojack is different.

1263
01:03:49,717 --> 01:03:50,489
Dad, come on!

1264
01:03:50,565 --> 01:03:53,090
You can escape. You read about it
every day. Couples escape.

1265
01:03:53,168 --> 01:03:56,160
- A husband escapes. Lovers flee tyranny.
- What you read is...

1266
01:03:56,237 --> 01:04:00,264
"Husband Shot Escaping." "Couple Shot..."

1267
01:04:00,342 --> 01:04:02,276
What is she talking about?

1268
01:04:02,344 --> 01:04:05,507
You want her to stay here
for the rest of her life?

1269
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:09,038
Yes, I'd rather she grew up here
than grow up an orphan.

1270
01:04:09,117 --> 01:04:12,018
I can tolerate anybody's orphans
but my own, okay?

1271
01:04:12,087 --> 01:04:14,351
- Walter, come here. Listen to me for a minute.
- I got a headache.

1272
01:04:14,422 --> 01:04:16,447
I got indigestion. I want to play dominoes.

1273
01:04:16,524 --> 01:04:19,186
Do you want your daughter
to see Donald again?

1274
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:22,821
Or at least meet some other
eligible men? Don't you want that?

1275
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,431
Tell me the plan. Just for fun.
Not that I'm interested...

1276
01:04:28,503 --> 01:04:30,596
but I want to know what he's thinking.

1277
01:04:30,672 --> 01:04:33,433
The night after tomorrow, we're
going to have a reception here.

1278
01:04:33,446 --> 01:04:34,369
Who's catering?

1279
01:04:34,442 --> 01:04:36,376
- Stop it!
- Would you let him finish?

1280
01:04:36,444 --> 01:04:39,971
It's a big party in honor of the emir.
Several hundred guests.

1281
01:04:40,048 --> 01:04:43,950
Dignitaries, men and women from
many nations, including this country.

1282
01:04:44,019 --> 01:04:47,113
Now, you two and Susan, get dressed.
You wait in your room.

1283
01:04:47,188 --> 01:04:47,776
Right.

1284
01:04:47,789 --> 01:04:49,588
Around midnight, when first
group of guests start to leave...

1285
01:04:49,657 --> 01:04:51,852
you come down, you put on your coats,
you got out with them.

1286
01:04:51,926 --> 01:04:52,705
Just like that.

1287
01:04:52,718 --> 01:04:55,089
Oh! It'll give you a chance
to wear your dark blue mohair.

1288
01:04:55,163 --> 01:04:57,461
I don't like my dark blue mohair.
My mohair itches.

1289
01:04:57,532 --> 01:05:00,160
How can mohair itch?
It's a very soft fabric.

1290
01:05:00,235 --> 01:05:02,965
- Sue me, it itches. I don't like the mohair.
- You're gonna have to wear...

1291
01:05:03,038 --> 01:05:06,064
a dark suit, because I'm not
gonna escape unless you dress.

1292
01:05:06,141 --> 01:05:08,473
I'm not dressing! We're not going anyplace.

1293
01:05:08,543 --> 01:05:10,977
The moment you go outside,
the embassy limousine will be waiting.

1294
01:05:11,046 --> 01:05:12,980
- You get in and you're off!
- It's simple.

1295
01:05:13,048 --> 01:05:15,846
- What if it works? Then where do we go?
- The rest is very simple.

1296
01:05:15,917 --> 01:05:20,149
My contacts are ready to see to it that
you'll be on your way home within hours.

1297
01:05:20,221 --> 01:05:24,783
Mr. Hollander, I implore you,
for the safety... of everyone involved.

1298
01:05:24,859 --> 01:05:27,623
We cannot procrastinate.
Timing is very important.

1299
01:05:27,695 --> 01:05:31,256
Walter, we'll get to see Seth again.
I miss him so much!

1300
01:05:31,332 --> 01:05:35,268
By the way, Walter, I didn't mention
this because I knew you'd get upset.

1301
01:05:35,336 --> 01:05:38,447
I got a letter from my brother.
Our apartment was robbed.

1302
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:39,500
What?

1303
01:05:39,574 --> 01:05:40,802
Yes, burglars broke in.

1304
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:44,072
They stole the portable TV
and all your custom-made shirts.

1305
01:05:44,145 --> 01:05:47,876
Oy, I'm a cursed caterer.
L-I'm running around here in Europe...

1306
01:05:47,949 --> 01:05:51,350
and in New York there's robbers
with my initials on their shirt.

1307
01:05:51,419 --> 01:05:53,353
- Evidently.
- Oy.

1308
01:05:53,421 --> 01:05:55,787
Can we, uh, start planning this?

1309
01:05:55,857 --> 01:06:00,817
Hello. Montague? This is Capulet.

1310
01:06:00,895 --> 01:06:02,829
Mmm.

1311
01:06:02,897 --> 01:06:07,561
The man with the blue scarf is in Vienna.

1312
01:06:07,635 --> 01:06:09,603
That's right.

1313
01:06:09,671 --> 01:06:13,903
The tulips are in full bloom.

1314
01:06:13,975 --> 01:06:18,742
Spring will be a little late this year.

1315
01:06:18,813 --> 01:06:22,579
And that's why the lady is a tramp.

1316
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:24,880
<i>Over and in.</i>

1317
01:06:30,825 --> 01:06:34,625
There is a reception
for a Middle Eastern dignitary.

1318
01:06:34,696 --> 01:06:37,392
I and my wife have been invited.

1319
01:06:37,465 --> 01:06:39,933
I thought you'd be interested in knowing.

1320
01:06:41,236 --> 01:06:44,831
<i>R-Right.</i>

1321
01:06:44,906 --> 01:06:47,170
Of course, you will attend.

1322
01:06:47,242 --> 01:06:50,905
<i>- I'll see to it that you're briefed in detail.
- Absolutely. Of course.</i>

1323
01:06:50,979 --> 01:06:54,608
<i>- Comrade Luchow will take your wife's place.
- Oh?</i>

1324
01:06:54,682 --> 01:06:57,810
Naturally, you will
introduce her as "Anna."

1325
01:06:58,987 --> 01:07:01,854
Understood. Understood.

1326
01:07:01,923 --> 01:07:05,120
There's something...

1327
01:07:05,193 --> 01:07:08,492
There's something going on there.

1328
01:07:08,563 --> 01:07:11,657
This ambassador's son, the young Magee.

1329
01:07:11,733 --> 01:07:14,361
He's either a genius...

1330
01:07:14,435 --> 01:07:16,369
or an idiot.

1331
01:07:25,213 --> 01:07:26,441
Look, tonight's the night.

1332
01:07:26,514 --> 01:07:29,244
I'd just feel better if we
go over the whole thing again.

1333
01:07:29,317 --> 01:07:31,615
It's a rotten plan, it won't work.
Let's call it off.

1334
01:07:31,686 --> 01:07:34,382
- We're not calling anything off.
- Hi, Mr. Hollander. Who are you?

1335
01:07:34,455 --> 01:07:36,514
Who am I? Who am I. I'm-I'm...

1336
01:07:36,591 --> 01:07:40,027
I'm John Randall. I work for
the Department of the Interior.

1337
01:07:40,094 --> 01:07:42,028
I'm married, I have four children.

1338
01:07:42,096 --> 01:07:45,156
I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
I went to school in California.

1339
01:07:45,233 --> 01:07:47,326
I first came to government under Roosevelt.

1340
01:07:47,402 --> 01:07:50,667
I majored in agriculture.
I drive a Chrysler Imperial, l...

1341
01:07:50,738 --> 01:07:51,734
Who's gonna ask me this?

1342
01:07:51,747 --> 01:07:54,265
In the event that they stop you
and ask you some questions...

1343
01:07:54,342 --> 01:07:56,276
your answers have to be consistent.

1344
01:07:56,344 --> 01:07:58,972
<i>- Who's gonna believe I'm Sam Randall?
- John Randall.</i>

1345
01:07:59,047 --> 01:08:01,379
John, Sam. I got such a headache from this.

1346
01:08:01,449 --> 01:08:04,179
- What are you doing in Europe?
- What am I doing in Europe?

1347
01:08:04,252 --> 01:08:08,018
Ask her. I'm in Europe to...

1348
01:08:08,089 --> 01:08:12,287
help underdeveloped nations with
soil conservation and erosion problems.

1349
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,920
- Very good.
- Don't "very good" me. Okay?

1350
01:08:14,996 --> 01:08:17,157
And I'm his lovely wife Carmen.

1351
01:08:17,232 --> 01:08:20,326
I was also the former
Miss Wisconsin of 1941.

1352
01:08:20,401 --> 01:08:22,562
If they believe that,
we win the whole Cold War.

1353
01:08:22,637 --> 01:08:25,435
One look at those varicose veins,
they'll think we're smuggling road maps.

1354
01:08:25,506 --> 01:08:27,440
Where are you staying in town?

1355
01:08:27,508 --> 01:08:30,568
The Grand Hotel for one week.
Then we're flying to Malaysia.

1356
01:08:30,645 --> 01:08:35,582
Okay, now, uh, uh... What happens
when you leave the embassy?

1357
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:38,585
About midnight, when some of
the other guests are leaving...

1358
01:08:38,653 --> 01:08:42,384
we casually say, "Excuse me,"
and we leave with the largest group.

1359
01:08:42,457 --> 01:08:46,450
Our chauffeur then drives us directly
to the lobby of the Grand Hotel.

1360
01:08:46,527 --> 01:08:51,157
That's if we're not stopped, arrested,
beaten, tortured and thrown in jail.

1361
01:08:51,232 --> 01:08:53,564
At the Grand Hotel, we switch cars.

1362
01:08:53,635 --> 01:08:57,264
A man will come up to me and say,
"Those are extremely lovely earrings.

1363
01:08:57,338 --> 01:08:59,272
My wife has a pair just like them."

1364
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:01,831
- He will be our driver. We go with him.
- Correct.

1365
01:09:01,909 --> 01:09:03,843
And if a stranger happens
to admire her earrings...

1366
01:09:03,911 --> 01:09:05,879
we'll wind up following him to Lapland.

1367
01:09:05,947 --> 01:09:09,178
What happens when he takes you
to the train station?

1368
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:12,879
What happens? Uh, someone
comes up to me, a man...

1369
01:09:12,954 --> 01:09:14,922
presumably not suspicious...

1370
01:09:14,989 --> 01:09:17,048
and he whispers in my ear,
"The grass is green."

1371
01:09:17,125 --> 01:09:21,255
For my money, Marion, he may as well
have a neon sign that says, "I am a spy."

1372
01:09:21,329 --> 01:09:24,423
- Okay, and then what do you do?
- What do we do?

1373
01:09:24,499 --> 01:09:27,059
We get on a train with him
going to Istanbul.

1374
01:09:27,135 --> 01:09:30,036
Another first in my life.
I need Istanbul like the plague.

1375
01:09:30,104 --> 01:09:32,538
- With my fear ofTurks.
- You're not going to get to Istanbul.

1376
01:09:32,607 --> 01:09:34,541
Halfway there, we jump off the train.

1377
01:09:34,609 --> 01:09:36,543
I'm really looking forward to that.

1378
01:09:36,611 --> 01:09:38,545
I haven't jumped off
a moving train in months.

1379
01:09:38,613 --> 01:09:40,808
Your contact is going to help you
with these maneuvers.

1380
01:09:40,882 --> 01:09:42,850
- You see? So what are you so worried about?
- Yeah.

1381
01:09:42,917 --> 01:09:45,784
<i>We'll see how you jump off a moving train.</i>

1382
01:09:45,853 --> 01:09:48,481
She breaks her neck trying
to find a seat in a movie house.

1383
01:09:48,556 --> 01:09:52,253
After leaving the train, we're met
by a man driving a wagon load of hay.

1384
01:09:52,327 --> 01:09:54,852
- Right, correct.
- Then we dress up as peasants.

1385
01:09:54,929 --> 01:09:57,420
We get onto the wagon and we go with him.

1386
01:09:57,498 --> 01:10:00,399
I got the worst hay fever in America,
he gets us on a hay wagon.

1387
01:10:00,468 --> 01:10:03,699
He takes us to the seashore,
where we're picked up by a submarine.

1388
01:10:03,771 --> 01:10:06,740
- Isn't it thrilling?
- Sub... Yesterday it was an airplane!

1389
01:10:06,808 --> 01:10:09,038
We had to change that.
There were some security precautions.

1390
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:12,341
I'm glad you told me. I'd have spent
the whole day looking for wings.

1391
01:10:12,413 --> 01:10:15,007
Now. Uh, oh! You're gonna need this.

1392
01:10:15,083 --> 01:10:18,075
You're gonna need some local currency.

1393
01:10:18,152 --> 01:10:20,279
Oh, forget it. Forget it. I got money.

1394
01:10:20,355 --> 01:10:24,553
- Walter, take it!
- You know, go ahead. I'll get the next...

1395
01:10:24,625 --> 01:10:26,855
We only have traveler's checks.
Take the money.

1396
01:10:26,928 --> 01:10:28,862
They're good anywhere, Marion.

1397
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:32,422
You're gonna stop in a chase through an
alley and start signing traveler's checks?

1398
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:35,526
Since when are there gonna be chases?
You said this was gonna be simple.

1399
01:10:35,603 --> 01:10:37,571
He said this would be simple.
I can't chase.

1400
01:10:37,638 --> 01:10:41,233
I got arch supports the size of barbells.

1401
01:10:41,309 --> 01:10:43,243
Mrs. Hollander's right. Take the money.

1402
01:10:43,311 --> 01:10:46,872
And, uh, one other thing.

1403
01:10:46,948 --> 01:10:49,940
Do you know how
to fire one of these, a pistol?

1404
01:10:50,017 --> 01:10:52,383
A pistol? How often in the catering
business is there a gunfight?

1405
01:10:52,453 --> 01:10:55,786
You load it here, and then
you just squeeze the trigger.

1406
01:10:55,857 --> 01:10:59,349
- Boy, it's a beauty.
- I don't think you should carry a gun.

1407
01:10:59,427 --> 01:11:01,588
- Why not?
- They're dangerous!

1408
01:11:01,662 --> 01:11:04,358
- They're not dangerous.
- You don't know how to use one!

1409
01:11:04,432 --> 01:11:06,366
Who doesn't know how to use one?
Since when?

1410
01:11:06,434 --> 01:11:08,368
- When did you ever use a gun?
- What are you talking about?

1411
01:11:08,436 --> 01:11:10,370
- I don't know how to use a gun?
- When did you use a gun?

1412
01:11:10,438 --> 01:11:12,372
- I don't know how to use a gun?
- When?

1413
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,601
- What do you mean, "when"? Plenty of times.
- I don't want you to carry a gun.

1414
01:11:14,675 --> 01:11:18,008
- I want to carry a gun.
- I'm not gonna go if you carry a gun.

1415
01:11:20,081 --> 01:11:22,015
Maybe I'm being, uh, overcautious.

1416
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:24,313
- She has to ruin everything.
- I want to carry...

1417
01:11:24,385 --> 01:11:26,785
- I'm not going if I can't.
- All right, carry a gun.

1418
01:11:26,854 --> 01:11:28,788
Just make sure it's not loaded.

1419
01:11:28,856 --> 01:11:31,848
You can never tell when this little
piece of tin comes in handy.

1420
01:11:31,926 --> 01:11:34,292
You see that?

1421
01:11:38,299 --> 01:11:41,666
They're gonna need food for
the journey, so I made him some...

1422
01:11:41,736 --> 01:11:44,796
marinated sea urchin sauteed
in the ink of the cuttlefish.

1423
01:11:44,872 --> 01:11:48,501
And the sauce is his favorite antacid.

1424
01:11:50,378 --> 01:11:53,745
<i>- Well, this is it.
- Ah, it's gonna be a cinch.</i>

1425
01:11:53,815 --> 01:11:55,840
Well, you got very confident
all of a sudden.

1426
01:11:55,917 --> 01:11:58,852
<i>Everybody makes a big deal out of nothing.</i>

1427
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:02,253
<i>- You think so?
- Believe me, it'll be over in two hours.</i>

1428
01:12:02,323 --> 01:12:04,951
It can't be any worse an ordeal
than your sister's wedding.

1429
01:12:05,026 --> 01:12:07,119
You think so?

1430
01:12:07,195 --> 01:12:09,686
Look at this. What are you crying about?

1431
01:12:09,764 --> 01:12:11,698
- She's crying already.
- I'm sorry.

1432
01:12:11,766 --> 01:12:15,759
What are you crying? You know, that's
why I don't like to go places with you.

1433
01:12:15,837 --> 01:12:18,032
'Cause you always make everything into a...

1434
01:12:18,105 --> 01:12:20,096
That's why I was not keen on escaping.

1435
01:12:20,174 --> 01:12:22,472
I knew you would turn it into
a whole story.

1436
01:12:22,543 --> 01:12:25,444
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

1437
01:12:25,513 --> 01:12:27,708
What do you mean, you don't know?

1438
01:12:27,782 --> 01:12:29,716
What are you crying for?

1439
01:12:29,784 --> 01:12:32,309
- Does something hurt you?
- No, I'm afraid.

1440
01:12:32,386 --> 01:12:35,321
Wha... What's to be afraid of?

1441
01:12:35,389 --> 01:12:38,324
Look at the very worst. The worst!

1442
01:12:38,392 --> 01:12:41,793
They catch us, they torture us,
you bite down on a cyanide capsule...

1443
01:12:41,863 --> 01:12:44,889
Look at this! How she's crying.

1444
01:12:44,966 --> 01:12:47,992
What are you... What the...

1445
01:12:48,069 --> 01:12:51,766
What's the matter? Hey, take it easy.

1446
01:12:51,839 --> 01:12:54,103
I'll protect you.
Did I not always protect you?

1447
01:12:54,175 --> 01:12:56,803
Have I always taken care of you? Always?

1448
01:12:56,878 --> 01:12:59,711
Remember years ago,
at that Palisades amusement park...

1449
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:02,840
that sailor whistled at you,
I hit him a shot in the teeth?

1450
01:13:02,917 --> 01:13:06,182
- Yeah. He fell out of his wheelchair.
- Exactly.

1451
01:13:06,254 --> 01:13:08,654
You were so beautiful then.
Come on. Cheer up.

1452
01:13:08,723 --> 01:13:11,453
- You had on your puce Aztec shawl.
- Yeah.

1453
01:13:11,526 --> 01:13:14,427
- You remember that?
- And you were in your dark blue dress suit.

1454
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,429
With the white socks and the saddle shoes.

1455
01:13:16,497 --> 01:13:18,431
I had to have the white socks.
I had a foot infection.

1456
01:13:18,499 --> 01:13:20,865
- So, you know, it was doctor's orders.
- Walter.

1457
01:13:20,935 --> 01:13:23,062
Will you protect me?

1458
01:13:23,137 --> 01:13:26,265
Have I not always... From the very start...

1459
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:30,606
when my mother despised you, when
she loathed you, I was on your side.

1460
01:13:30,678 --> 01:13:34,409
Remember that? I didn't hold your hand
through two pregnancies...

1461
01:13:34,482 --> 01:13:38,418
and four false alarms and a very, very
complicated oral prophylaxis?

1462
01:13:38,486 --> 01:13:41,683
- Remember that? Have a little faith in me.
- Yeah.

1463
01:13:41,756 --> 01:13:45,487
- I'll take care of you.
- Walter, I've been such a terrible wife!

1464
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:49,826
I wouldn't say "terrible."
Terrible is, you know...

1465
01:13:49,897 --> 01:13:52,263
After all, I'm not easy
to live with, you know?

1466
01:13:52,333 --> 01:13:55,598
A lot of women would think
that I was moderately flawed.

1467
01:13:55,611 --> 01:13:56,702
No! No, no.

1468
01:13:56,771 --> 01:14:00,969
- A good case could be made for that.
- No. No.

1469
01:14:01,042 --> 01:14:03,977
- Come on. Get dressed. Get dressed.
- I'm wearing my new dress.

1470
01:14:04,045 --> 01:14:08,175
You better bring a pair of sneakers.
We might have to jump over a wall.

1471
01:14:08,249 --> 01:14:11,946
- Wally!
- Well, now, you haven't called me Wally since...

1472
01:14:12,019 --> 01:14:14,055
Since the harvest moon ball years ago.
Remember that?

1473
01:14:14,068 --> 01:14:14,749
Yeah.

1474
01:14:14,822 --> 01:14:18,155
I said even then, if you ever called me
Wally again, I would break your head.

1475
01:14:18,225 --> 01:14:20,420
- I'm goin', I'm goin'.
- Get dressed. Right.

1476
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:44,984
<i>Mr. Hollander.</i>

1477
01:14:45,052 --> 01:14:48,453
Oh! Oh! Oh, I've been shot!

1478
01:14:48,522 --> 01:14:51,616
Oh! Help me! Help me!

1479
01:15:08,309 --> 01:15:12,245
He's a little shy. You're so...

1480
01:15:12,313 --> 01:15:14,338
Any stories to... Come on.

1481
01:15:14,415 --> 01:15:18,715
Come on! Y-e-es. Oh, ho, ho.

1482
01:15:21,022 --> 01:15:24,890
You know what they say, "An apple a day
keeps the cossacks away."

1483
01:15:28,262 --> 01:15:30,992
Mr. Magee. Please. Excuse me. Excuse me.

1484
01:15:32,466 --> 01:15:34,730
Your Highness. Ah, I hope
you're enjoying your visit.

1485
01:15:34,802 --> 01:15:37,327
- My father wishes to extend...
- Pick a card. Any card.

1486
01:15:37,405 --> 01:15:40,238
- We'll be leaving tomorrow.
- Father Drob...

1487
01:15:40,307 --> 01:15:42,241
- Father Drobney, this is not...
- Oh, please, any one.

1488
01:15:42,309 --> 01:15:44,777
- No, I'm busy!
- Pick a card. Oh, please!

1489
01:15:44,845 --> 01:15:46,779
- Please. Please.
- I'm busy.

1490
01:15:46,847 --> 01:15:49,509
There's a message on
the two of spades. Please.

1491
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:51,517
Well, just tell me. Nobody can hear.

1492
01:15:51,585 --> 01:15:55,146
- One of the guests is from the secret police.
- How do you know?

1493
01:15:55,222 --> 01:15:57,782
Gruber, that's not his wife.

1494
01:15:57,858 --> 01:16:00,554
- Oh, God.
- She's an agent. There may be others.

1495
01:16:00,628 --> 01:16:02,755
<i>- Hi. Hi.
- Where are your parents?</i>

1496
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:04,855
My parents? They're not here.

1497
01:16:04,932 --> 01:16:07,264
My father's having trouble
getting his holster on.

1498
01:16:07,334 --> 01:16:10,997
- This place is crawling with agents.
- Really? Look.

1499
01:16:11,072 --> 01:16:13,597
- No matter what happens, I just...
- Oh, please, please.

1500
01:16:13,674 --> 01:16:16,302
Don't start a sentence with "no matter
what happens." This was my idea...

1501
01:16:16,377 --> 01:16:18,242
so it's not gonna work, I know.

1502
01:16:18,312 --> 01:16:20,246
- Can I tell you something?
- What?

1503
01:16:20,314 --> 01:16:23,477
- You look great.
- Oh, thanks.

1504
01:16:29,123 --> 01:16:32,388
- All right. Try to appear casual.
- I am appearing casual.

1505
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:35,258
- Yeah.
- Walter, you can tell you're carrying a gun.

1506
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:38,321
- You can not!
- There's a big bulge under your shoulder.

1507
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:39,558
It's the way I'm built.

1508
01:16:39,571 --> 01:16:42,335
It's not the way you're built.
You don't have a handle.

1509
01:16:42,403 --> 01:16:45,736
- Leave me alone, okay?
- Walter, put it upstairs. Put it upstairs.

1510
01:16:45,806 --> 01:16:48,400
- No, we need it.
- We don't need it.

1511
01:16:48,476 --> 01:16:50,740
You shot the sultan's assistant today.

1512
01:16:50,811 --> 01:16:53,336
You know, sometimes they like
an eye for an eye.

1513
01:16:53,414 --> 01:16:56,247
- I'm carrying a gun.
- Oh, Walter.

1514
01:16:56,317 --> 01:16:59,514
- You know, everybody's staring at your bulge.
- Who cares what you say?

1515
01:16:59,587 --> 01:17:01,646
Uh, we haven't met, have we?

1516
01:17:01,722 --> 01:17:04,919
Oh, I'm-I'm-I'm John Randall. I work
in the Department of the Interior.

1517
01:17:04,992 --> 01:17:07,927
I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
but I went to school in California.

1518
01:17:07,995 --> 01:17:10,190
I majored in agriculture.
I'm married. I have four children.

1519
01:17:10,264 --> 01:17:14,792
I drive a Chrysler Imperial. I'm John
Randall. I work in the Department of...

1520
01:17:14,869 --> 01:17:17,895
- And I'm his lovely wife, Carmen.
- How do you do?

1521
01:17:17,972 --> 01:17:21,635
Yannis Kasnar, and this is
the Countess Wilhelmina Bordoni.

1522
01:17:21,709 --> 01:17:25,008
- Charmed.
- Say hello to the countess, darling.

1523
01:17:25,079 --> 01:17:27,138
Hello, darling.

1524
01:17:27,214 --> 01:17:30,377
- This wine is extraordinary. Have you tasted it?
- Mm, exquisite.

1525
01:17:30,451 --> 01:17:33,477
- Mm.
- Somewhat diffident, and ephemeral.

1526
01:17:33,554 --> 01:17:36,489
- Wouldn't you say, Mr. Randall?
- Yes, that's how I'd put it.

1527
01:17:36,557 --> 01:17:40,823
"The flavor is subtly demure, and
the bouquet is playfully articulate."

1528
01:17:40,895 --> 01:17:42,829
<i>Esquire magazine.</i>

1529
01:17:42,897 --> 01:17:44,831
How long have you been here?

1530
01:17:44,899 --> 01:17:46,833
- A couple of days.
- Two weeks.

1531
01:17:46,901 --> 01:17:49,335
- We're over at the big hotel.
- Just a few days, really. At the Grand.

1532
01:17:49,403 --> 01:17:51,667
- I can't stand it myself. It's really...
- It's a beautiful place.

1533
01:17:51,739 --> 01:17:54,640
Actually, we should be going. You know?

1534
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:56,869
It's late, and come... Come, Walter.

1535
01:17:56,944 --> 01:17:58,878
- Good night.
- Oh, it's Walter?

1536
01:17:58,946 --> 01:18:01,540
My own wife doesn't realize my name is Sam.

1537
01:18:01,615 --> 01:18:05,016
- Oh, Sam.
- No! John. John, it's John.

1538
01:18:05,085 --> 01:18:08,384
Actually, because it's... See,
my real name is "RandallJohnsam,"

1539
01:18:08,455 --> 01:18:11,015
but they kept confusing me
in Washington with Lyndon Johnson.

1540
01:18:11,091 --> 01:18:14,288
So I keep getting his phone messages
and meat bills.

1541
01:18:14,361 --> 01:18:16,829
- How interesting.
- It's quite a hassle.

1542
01:18:16,897 --> 01:18:19,297
Well, we must be off.
We've got to be in Afghanistan...

1543
01:18:19,366 --> 01:18:21,960
- In Tunisia. Tunisia.
- Tunisia. That's the same...

1544
01:18:22,036 --> 01:18:24,630
- But come, Marion. Let's go.
- Marion?

1545
01:18:24,705 --> 01:18:27,071
Oh, I'm his lovely wife, Carmen.

1546
01:18:27,141 --> 01:18:32,204
Let me get it. Ooh, ooh, ooh...

1547
01:18:32,279 --> 01:18:36,079
My cigarette lighter. I got
a good buy at the duty-free shop.

1548
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:39,381
Oh, may I, uh... May I have a light?

1549
01:18:39,453 --> 01:18:41,614
A light?

1550
01:18:41,689 --> 01:18:45,181
You know, I don't think it has a wick.

1551
01:18:45,259 --> 01:18:47,386
Or fluid, or flints.

1552
01:18:47,461 --> 01:18:50,555
- Oh, no. No matter.
- This works on a different principle, right?

1553
01:18:50,631 --> 01:18:52,758
- Haven't figured it out yet.
- Well, we have to be going.

1554
01:18:52,833 --> 01:18:55,563
Party's about over, and I hate to be
the last to leave.

1555
01:18:55,636 --> 01:18:58,230
- Yes, well, nice meeting you.
- It was a pleasure.

1556
01:18:58,305 --> 01:19:00,899
- Lucky those cheap lighters never work.
- I don't want to hear...

1557
01:19:00,975 --> 01:19:03,205
- Can we go now, please?
- Yes, yes.

1558
01:19:03,277 --> 01:19:07,077
- I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
- Sam Randall.

1559
01:19:07,147 --> 01:19:10,241
- John. John Randall.
- John Randall, from...

1560
01:19:10,317 --> 01:19:13,343
I'm Helmut Gruber, and this is
my lovely wife, Mrs. Gruber.

1561
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:16,548
Hi. How do you do?

1562
01:19:16,624 --> 01:19:19,593
We weren't aware there were
other American guests here.

1563
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:21,787
- No, there aren't.
- I'd like to freshen up.

1564
01:19:21,862 --> 01:19:24,729
- Have you met the Hollanders?
- The Hollanders? No!

1565
01:19:24,798 --> 01:19:26,857
- We don't know the Hollanders.
- Pick a card.

1566
01:19:26,934 --> 01:19:28,993
- Any card.
- No, no, no. Not now, Drobney.

1567
01:19:29,069 --> 01:19:31,003
- Oh, please. Pick a card.
- No, no, no.

1568
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:33,005
Yes, yes, yes. Go pick.

1569
01:19:33,073 --> 01:19:36,338
Picking. More picking. Please pick a card.

1570
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:39,004
- It's got writing on it. Plus, we've got...
- Nah!

1571
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:42,242
<i>- Walter, it's so late, we should...
- Randall!</i>

1572
01:19:42,316 --> 01:19:45,547
Mr. Randall. Mister, uh, your car.

1573
01:19:45,619 --> 01:19:47,553
- Yes, the car.
- Good evening.

1574
01:19:48,822 --> 01:19:50,756
Mm.

1575
01:19:50,824 --> 01:19:54,260
<i>...tie it together again.
- He's a priest. Magic is not his full-time job.</i>

1576
01:19:54,328 --> 01:19:58,264
- I have to go. I'm sorry.
- But he said he was gonna put it together.

1577
01:19:58,332 --> 01:20:02,200
- Well, Mr. Magee, thank you so much.
- Very nice party.

1578
01:20:02,269 --> 01:20:05,261
- Thank you very much.
- A lovely, lovely evening.

1579
01:20:05,339 --> 01:20:08,331
- Very, very nice party. Here.
- Yes, we'll be going.

1580
01:20:08,409 --> 01:20:11,503
- Oh, yes. Nice to have chatted with you.
- Come on, Carmen.

1581
01:20:11,578 --> 01:20:15,139
Hope to see you soon.
Yes, John, yes. Good-bye.

1582
01:20:15,215 --> 01:20:17,115
<i>Yes, well, um...</i>

1583
01:20:17,184 --> 01:20:19,311
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to have met you.

1584
01:20:19,386 --> 01:20:21,650
And maybe, maybe I'll see you
in Newark sometime.

1585
01:20:21,722 --> 01:20:23,883
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1586
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:33,996
"Orville, do you think they'll give us
a parade up Fifth Avenue?"

1587
01:20:34,068 --> 01:20:38,801
"I don't doubt it." "Mother would love
that." "She would, wouldn't she?"

1588
01:20:38,872 --> 01:20:41,306
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1589
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:44,572
What happened? Oh, my goodness,
what happened?

1590
01:20:44,645 --> 01:20:48,479
Oh, what happened? Oh, my...

1591
01:20:51,218 --> 01:20:55,120
Stay calm! That's right. Oh, my God!

1592
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:57,419
Tell me what the hell happened?

1593
01:20:59,660 --> 01:21:02,322
- Who shot me?
- Whoa.

1594
01:21:02,396 --> 01:21:04,330
Dad.

1595
01:21:07,134 --> 01:21:08,624
<i>No, I will not hear of it.</i>

1596
01:21:08,702 --> 01:21:11,603
<i>Send the embassy limousines.
We leave immediately.</i>

1597
01:21:11,672 --> 01:21:13,640
His Majesty will not stay an extra minute.

1598
01:21:13,707 --> 01:21:16,938
<i>- But, sir, l...
- No, now, now! This instant!</i>

1599
01:21:17,011 --> 01:21:19,411
- Oscar has prepared a wonderful brunch.
- No. Brunch?

1600
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:23,507
- I am not going to stay here for brunch.
- Let me get the ambassador.

1601
01:21:23,584 --> 01:21:27,850
How could you do that?
How could you attempt an escape?

1602
01:21:27,921 --> 01:21:31,084
Dad, the situation called
for something bold, you know?

1603
01:21:31,158 --> 01:21:33,126
- If it had worked...
- But it failed!

1604
01:21:33,193 --> 01:21:35,127
Like everything else you do, it failed!

1605
01:21:35,195 --> 01:21:39,188
I mean, riots, bombs, pickets,
that's never happened in my embassy.

1606
01:21:39,266 --> 01:21:41,200
And this morning
a devout priest produced...

1607
01:21:41,268 --> 01:21:43,634
a seven of spades behind my left ear.

1608
01:21:43,704 --> 01:21:47,868
<i>- He's been working on that.
- He was having a hard time...</i>

1609
01:21:47,941 --> 01:21:50,375
- Come in!
- "The flight went well."

1610
01:21:50,444 --> 01:21:53,311
<i>- Flight?
- "Yes, it did, Orville. I was surprised."</i>

1611
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:55,405
"Me too, Wilbur."

1612
01:21:55,482 --> 01:21:58,007
"Well, I shouldn't say
surprised, but encouraged."

1613
01:21:58,085 --> 01:22:02,454
"Me too." "Now, you mark my words,
we'll show the world."

1614
01:22:02,523 --> 01:22:07,119
I'll get you for this, Axel.
I promise you, I will get you for this.

1615
01:22:07,194 --> 01:22:10,357
<i>The emir's leaving.
I think the situation is irreparable.</i>

1616
01:22:10,431 --> 01:22:15,562
<i>I'll speak to him. By the way,
your mother called.</i>

1617
01:22:15,636 --> 01:22:18,434
She wants you to mail her
your birth certificate.

1618
01:22:18,505 --> 01:22:21,201
- Come on, boys.
- Huh? Oh. "Have you met my brother?"

1619
01:22:21,275 --> 01:22:23,470
"Oh, hello. You look very well."

1620
01:22:23,544 --> 01:22:26,069
"Thank you, I feel well."

1621
01:22:27,948 --> 01:22:33,011
Well, you wondered what happens,
you go along with a lunatic.

1622
01:22:33,087 --> 01:22:36,022
I told you the gun was dangerous.

1623
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:38,024
Again, she's still on the gun.

1624
01:22:38,092 --> 01:22:41,528
You shot two people in the last
24 hours! How many do you need?

1625
01:22:41,595 --> 01:22:45,326
Marion, how am I gonna know
there was the ambassador?

1626
01:22:45,399 --> 01:22:49,062
- You want him to wear a little sign?
- The gun went off by itself!

1627
01:22:49,136 --> 01:22:52,264
I didn't shoot the gun. It must have
been one of those new guns.

1628
01:22:52,339 --> 01:22:55,968
They buy 'em by the bushel from Taiwan.

1629
01:22:56,043 --> 01:22:59,206
Axel, I'm sorry. This was all our fault.
Right, Dad?

1630
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:01,213
If it was anybody's fault, it was my fault.

1631
01:23:01,281 --> 01:23:03,249
And now they've doubled the guards outside.

1632
01:23:03,317 --> 01:23:06,514
It was a nice try, Magee.
Unfortunately, I shot the boss.

1633
01:23:06,587 --> 01:23:08,646
But you know, you can't have everything.

1634
01:23:08,722 --> 01:23:12,055
I better call Barney Silverman.
He's probably still at Montauk Point...

1635
01:23:12,126 --> 01:23:15,220
with the station wagon,
waiting for us to surface.

1636
01:23:15,295 --> 01:23:18,025
- What is this? What are you doing?
- Just doing a little laundry.

1637
01:23:18,098 --> 01:23:20,328
Mr. Burns says the emir is packing.

1638
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:24,131
- She's doing laundry.
- She does Kilroy, she does Burns...

1639
01:23:24,204 --> 01:23:27,298
she dusts, she waxes, and now
she's doing the bedouins.

1640
01:23:27,374 --> 01:23:29,308
Just two of his wives.

1641
01:23:29,376 --> 01:23:33,278
They're lovely young women.
I'll give it to them.

1642
01:23:33,347 --> 01:23:35,542
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- What's the matter?

1643
01:23:35,616 --> 01:23:37,880
<i>- I got an idea.
- I heard that. He's got an idea.</i>

1644
01:23:37,951 --> 01:23:40,181
- I'll be in the fallout shelter.
- How many do you have?

1645
01:23:40,254 --> 01:23:42,347
- Just two.
- Okay.

1646
01:23:42,422 --> 01:23:45,516
- What are you thinking?
- Father Drobney, come down here.

1647
01:23:45,592 --> 01:23:48,584
What's going through your mind, Magee,
besides the usual cattle stampede?

1648
01:23:48,662 --> 01:23:51,028
Stand right there. Yeah, it'll fit.

1649
01:23:51,098 --> 01:23:53,623
- Wait, this could work. Do you see?
- We gotta hurry, though.

1650
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:56,897
- They're gonna leave any minute.
- What are we discussing?

1651
01:23:56,970 --> 01:23:59,598
- You know I'm a size ten.
- Yeah. Okay, you two.

1652
01:23:59,673 --> 01:24:01,607
- Change. Quickly.
- Change what?

1653
01:24:01,675 --> 01:24:04,235
- I don't get it.
- We leave with the emir's harem!

1654
01:24:04,311 --> 01:24:06,279
What's wrong with you?

1655
01:24:06,346 --> 01:24:08,439
- A harem?
- Yes.

1656
01:24:08,515 --> 01:24:12,349
- The two of us...
- Yeah, because with the veils, wh-who'll notice?

1657
01:24:12,419 --> 01:24:14,478
He has 14, now he's got two more.

1658
01:24:14,555 --> 01:24:16,523
You're telling me the man
doesn't count his harem?

1659
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:19,753
- Who doesn't count the harem?
- This is a brilliant plan! This could work.

1660
01:24:19,826 --> 01:24:22,795
- No, no, no, no, no. I'm not dressing as an Arab.
- No, no, you are.

1661
01:24:22,863 --> 01:24:25,730
And then you get into the embassy limousine,
it takes you to the transfer point...

1662
01:24:25,799 --> 01:24:27,994
and you meet Drobney's contacts!

1663
01:24:28,068 --> 01:24:31,902
- Instantly he can see there's two more wives.
- Maybe he will, maybe he won't.

1664
01:24:31,972 --> 01:24:34,099
- It's worth a shot.
- Don't tell me maybe. I don't want to know maybe.

1665
01:24:34,174 --> 01:24:37,405
Forget it. Let him spend the money
on a lobotomy.

1666
01:24:37,477 --> 01:24:40,674
- We're wasting time here.
- What about Susan? We only have two outfits.

1667
01:24:40,747 --> 01:24:43,409
I got that figured out too.

1668
01:24:43,483 --> 01:24:46,247
- You two, just dress, okay?
- All right. Let's go.

1669
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:49,187
- Walter, here.
- I'm not dressing, Marion. Leave me alone.

1670
01:24:49,256 --> 01:24:51,724
I don't want to wind up in a harem.
We'll spend the rest of our lives...

1671
01:24:51,792 --> 01:24:54,090
on satin pillows in the Persian Gulf.

1672
01:24:54,161 --> 01:24:57,528
- Quickly. Would you change?
- No, I don't want to.

1673
01:24:57,598 --> 01:24:59,896
Marion, is that what you want?
To be a love slave?

1674
01:24:59,967 --> 01:25:03,095
You're at least a man. I'm the one that's
gonna have to learn those wiggly dances.

1675
01:25:03,170 --> 01:25:05,229
<i>- Let's go!
- How did you think of this?</i>

1676
01:25:05,305 --> 01:25:07,603
- I never would have thought of this plan.
- Ah...

1677
01:25:07,674 --> 01:25:11,166
So sorry. Cold compresses.
Wives. Clear. Coming through.

1678
01:25:11,245 --> 01:25:13,213
Mr. Magee. You called?

1679
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,341
Father Drobney. Are your
contacts still ready to go?

1680
01:25:15,354 --> 01:25:16,044
Yes.

1681
01:25:16,116 --> 01:25:18,050
- Good. Alert them immediately.
- Absolutely.

1682
01:25:18,118 --> 01:25:19,121
All systems go.

1683
01:25:19,134 --> 01:25:22,179
You're transforming before my eyes.
It's wonderful.

1684
01:25:22,256 --> 01:25:24,190
Susan, every once in a while
fate comes along...

1685
01:25:24,258 --> 01:25:26,453
takes a man by the hand and
allows him to move mountains.

1686
01:25:26,526 --> 01:25:28,721
- Isn't it faith? I think it's faith.
- Is it... faith?

1687
01:25:28,795 --> 01:25:31,787
I always thought it was fate.
Maybe that's why it never made sense.

1688
01:25:31,865 --> 01:25:35,232
- I'm so proud of you.
- Before you walked into my life...

1689
01:25:35,302 --> 01:25:38,760
- I was nothing, I was a loser...
- I didn't walk into your life.

1690
01:25:38,839 --> 01:25:39,760
I ran.

1691
01:25:39,773 --> 01:25:42,570
But now, I have this
feeling I could do anything!

1692
01:25:42,643 --> 01:25:45,874
I have this confidence,
this sense of optimism.

1693
01:25:45,946 --> 01:25:48,574
Maybe you're really a manic-depressive.

1694
01:25:48,649 --> 01:25:51,584
- No, I'm in love.
- You're in love.

1695
01:25:51,652 --> 01:25:54,951
I'm in love, for the first time
since Elsie Holmquist.

1696
01:25:55,022 --> 01:25:57,081
- Who's Elsie Holmquist? You never mentioned her.
- This Swedish girl.

1697
01:25:57,157 --> 01:25:59,352
I met her in an embassy.
Boy, could she ski.

1698
01:25:59,426 --> 01:26:02,361
- That's how I broke my pelvis.
- Oh.

1699
01:26:02,429 --> 01:26:05,057
- Susan, you've become my whole world.
- You've become mine.

1700
01:26:05,132 --> 01:26:07,464
I am so happy, I could sing!

1701
01:26:07,534 --> 01:26:10,002
Do I have to listen to this?

1702
01:26:10,070 --> 01:26:12,971
- Ha! Okay.
- See you in a minute.

1703
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:16,373
The storm we were expecting
will be a little late.

1704
01:26:16,443 --> 01:26:19,037
The boy with the blue hair...

1705
01:26:19,112 --> 01:26:21,740
is fondling his chipmunk.

1706
01:26:21,815 --> 01:26:25,376
<i>Never call with anything under...</i>

1707
01:26:25,452 --> 01:26:27,682
a pair of queens.

1708
01:26:27,754 --> 01:26:31,019
And the green grass grows all around.

1709
01:26:31,091 --> 01:26:33,116
All around.

1710
01:26:33,193 --> 01:26:36,162
So, toot, toot, tootsie, good-bye.

1711
01:26:36,229 --> 01:26:38,254
<i>Ready.</i>

1712
01:26:38,332 --> 01:26:41,130
- Marion, it itches.
- How can it itch? This is silk.

1713
01:26:41,201 --> 01:26:45,137
I'm telling you a million times. My doctor
told me I have the thighs of a princess.

1714
01:26:45,205 --> 01:26:47,673
- So you wearing a princess's clothes.
- It itches!

1715
01:26:47,741 --> 01:26:49,709
- It's silk.
- Everything is ready.

1716
01:26:49,776 --> 01:26:51,710
Go immediately and God bless you.

1717
01:26:51,778 --> 01:26:55,475
Just stay calm, cool, collected,
and if anybody asks you anything...

1718
01:26:55,549 --> 01:26:57,483
just mutter something about Allah.

1719
01:26:57,551 --> 01:26:58,170
Uh-huh.

1720
01:26:58,183 --> 01:27:00,076
The limousine driver will
take you to the Grand Hotel.

1721
01:27:00,153 --> 01:27:02,644
From there on, our plans
are precisely the same.

1722
01:27:02,723 --> 01:27:05,851
- What about Susan? We didn't decide.
- In a little while...

1723
01:27:05,926 --> 01:27:09,327
Susan and I are gonna walk out of here
under full diplomatic immunity.

1724
01:27:09,396 --> 01:27:12,490
- How are we gonna do that?
- Well, as the wife of a foreign diplomat...

1725
01:27:12,566 --> 01:27:14,500
you'd be entitled to that.

1726
01:27:14,568 --> 01:27:17,298
- Wife? You-You and her?
- It's perfect.

1727
01:27:17,371 --> 01:27:20,932
We're both American citizens.
This is United States territory.

1728
01:27:21,007 --> 01:27:23,305
Father Drobney is a priest.

1729
01:27:23,377 --> 01:27:26,813
- If you'll have me.
- Oh, Axel!

1730
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:30,316
My Susan! A bride!

1731
01:27:30,384 --> 01:27:33,751
This is the happiest day of my life!

1732
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:37,278
I only wish your father
were alive to see this!

1733
01:27:37,357 --> 01:27:40,326
- I am alive. I'm standing right here.
- Oh, yeah.

1734
01:27:40,394 --> 01:27:43,522
- I'm sorry! I got carried away.
- 'Cause I'm wearing this.

1735
01:27:43,597 --> 01:27:47,089
- You look like you should be named Fatima.
- This is a brilliant plan.

1736
01:27:47,167 --> 01:27:50,625
- You're gonna marry her? She's gonna marry...
- Yes!

1737
01:27:50,704 --> 01:27:53,468
- You want him to?
- I do, yes! I love you.

1738
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:57,704
Oh. Oh! Oh.

1739
01:27:57,778 --> 01:28:00,542
Walter. Walter. Stop that. We have to go.

1740
01:28:00,614 --> 01:28:02,878
Walter. Walter, control yourself.

1741
01:28:02,949 --> 01:28:04,883
- Mr. Hollander...
- Stop! Stop!

1742
01:28:04,951 --> 01:28:06,885
All right. Shh! Walter.

1743
01:28:06,953 --> 01:28:09,353
Listen, Susan. Darling.

1744
01:28:09,423 --> 01:28:11,857
When we're on the submarine,
you'll wire me your silverware pattern.

1745
01:28:11,925 --> 01:28:14,894
- Absolutely. As soon as I know.
- Good luck.

1746
01:28:14,961 --> 01:28:16,826
- You stepped on my Hush Puppies!
- Oh, sorry.

1747
01:28:16,897 --> 01:28:21,834
- Walter, take it easy.
- Let's go.

1748
01:28:21,902 --> 01:28:24,200
Now, now!

1749
01:28:24,271 --> 01:28:27,263
- But they're marrying!
- Yes!

1750
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:31,743
God keep them. I'm so happy for you both.

1751
01:28:31,812 --> 01:28:34,280
- Thank you.
- I'm happy. Are you happy?

1752
01:28:34,347 --> 01:28:37,339
- Yeah!
- I'm happy.

1753
01:28:37,417 --> 01:28:39,408
You look so great.

1754
01:28:39,486 --> 01:28:42,717
Father, I didn't speak out of turn.
You can do a ceremony, right?

1755
01:28:42,789 --> 01:28:45,724
- Yes, I could do. Yes. Six years I haven't.
- Is he a rabbi?

1756
01:28:45,792 --> 01:28:47,726
- Do we need a rabbi?
- Hour and a half...

1757
01:28:47,794 --> 01:28:50,285
<i>- Do you know any rabbis in the underground?
- Just have to change my clothes.</i>

1758
01:28:54,568 --> 01:28:57,935
Come. Come, let's go. Soon
we will be home at the palace...

1759
01:28:58,004 --> 01:29:00,529
and I expect every one of you
to go out of your way...

1760
01:29:00,607 --> 01:29:05,237
to see that His Majesty forgets
this unpleasant occurrence.

1761
01:29:05,312 --> 01:29:08,645
I'm sure you know what I mean, hmm?

1762
01:29:08,715 --> 01:29:12,151
- Hey, why is he staring at me?
- You look sexy in those clothes.

1763
01:29:12,219 --> 01:29:16,212
I don't like this, Marion.
I don't like this.

1764
01:29:16,289 --> 01:29:18,849
Well, you look fine.

1765
01:29:22,729 --> 01:29:25,789
<i>That morning, the Hollanders
left the United States embassy...</i>

1766
01:29:25,866 --> 01:29:29,825
<i>with a boldness and courage
unknown to them before.</i>

1767
01:29:29,903 --> 01:29:34,101
<i>Indeed, the plan devised by Axel Magee
was a brilliant one.</i>

1768
01:29:34,174 --> 01:29:37,234
<i>The following day, they
were married by Father Drobney.</i>

1769
01:29:37,310 --> 01:29:42,077
Therefore, I pronounce you man and wife.

1770
01:29:42,148 --> 01:29:45,174
Congratulations!

1771
01:29:49,389 --> 01:29:53,189
Look. Hey! Oh, it's a joke.

1772
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:57,993
<i>Within 24 hours, the Hollanders were
safely en route to the United States.</i>

1773
01:29:58,064 --> 01:30:00,794
<i>Axel Magee quit the Foreign Service...</i>

1774
01:30:00,867 --> 01:30:03,131
<i>and went to work for his father-in-law...</i>

1775
01:30:03,203 --> 01:30:06,434
<i>who was overwhelmed with
the young man's natural gifts...</i>

1776
01:30:06,506 --> 01:30:09,600
<i>for sculpting the bride and groom
out of chopped liver.</i>

1777
01:30:09,676 --> 01:30:14,238
<i>At last, the fortune-teller's prediction
about Magee as a new Michelangelo...</i>

1778
01:30:14,314 --> 01:30:16,339
<i>had proved true.</i>
