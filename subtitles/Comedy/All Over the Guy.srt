1
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,181
One- two-

2
00:00:18,222 --> 00:00:20,683
One, two, three, four...

3
00:00:30,483 --> 00:00:32,610
- You've got to face it -

4
00:00:32,652 --> 00:00:36,072
- Love makes no sense -

5
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:41,869
- Don't try to fight it -

6
00:00:41,952 --> 00:00:47,124
- All your defenses
are useless to you now -

7
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:51,544
- When you leave this room -

8
00:00:51,586 --> 00:00:54,505
- All you will
think about is me -

9
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:04,097
- I'll be every song on your radio,
everything on your TV -

10
00:01:04,139 --> 00:01:07,142
- Just wait and see -

11
00:01:07,184 --> 00:01:12,146
- Even though you
never looked at me -

12
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,732
- I know the real you -

13
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:17,276
- Is behind those eyes -

14
00:01:17,318 --> 00:01:19,820
- Every true story -

15
00:01:19,904 --> 00:01:23,073
- Is full of lies -

16
00:01:23,115 --> 00:01:26,159
- We tell -

17
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:37,420
Recording: Hi, this is Eli,
leave a message.

18
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:43,634
once again. Call me.

19
00:01:46,303 --> 00:01:48,596
- I'll take you by the hand -

20
00:01:48,638 --> 00:01:51,808
- And soon
I'll cool your fire -

21
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:54,685
- Out of your body -

22
00:01:54,727 --> 00:01:57,438
- There is no way -

23
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,107
- You can stand me -

24
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:02,401
- I know the real you... -

25
00:02:10,783 --> 00:02:12,118
- That keep still -

26
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:18,415
- The real you -

27
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:25,088
- The real you -

28
00:02:26,673 --> 00:02:33,137
- The real you -

29
00:02:33,179 --> 00:02:38,142
- The real you -

30
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:40,185
- The real... -

31
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,813
- You. -

32
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,822
Hi. I'm Eli Wyckoff.
I'm here for my test results.

33
00:02:52,863 --> 00:02:54,240
You're about an hour early.

34
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:56,408
Why don't you get yourself
some coffee?

35
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:58,160
I'm going to wait,
if that's okay.

36
00:02:58,202 --> 00:02:59,202
Okay.

37
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,000
Is this your first time?

38
00:03:08,461 --> 00:03:09,670
My first?

39
00:03:09,712 --> 00:03:10,671
No, no.

40
00:03:12,715 --> 00:03:16,260
I have this habit of getting
tested after every boy-

41
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:18,428
guy that I ever...

42
00:03:20,138 --> 00:03:21,932
There's only been three
in the past few...

43
00:03:24,058 --> 00:03:26,311
This is the third, so it's not
really a habit.

44
00:03:27,395 --> 00:03:28,938
- Yet.
- Uh-huh.

45
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:32,650
Oh, no. It's not even a chance
that I have- you know?

46
00:03:33,984 --> 00:03:35,068
I know the dangers.

47
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,321
I do the police blotter
for the Hollywood News,

48
00:03:37,362 --> 00:03:40,407
so, me and danger
are like this.

49
00:03:40,448 --> 00:03:41,825
So why are you here?

50
00:03:46,412 --> 00:03:48,456
Uh-huh.

51
00:03:48,497 --> 00:03:49,540
Did you suck his dick?

52
00:03:50,749 --> 00:03:52,084
Then you better come in.

53
00:03:52,084 --> 00:03:53,585
Okay.

54
00:03:57,756 --> 00:04:01,509
Hi, I'm Tom,
and I'm an alcoholic.

55
00:04:01,551 --> 00:04:02,719
Group: Hi, Tom.

56
00:04:07,556 --> 00:04:09,558
I'm 1 0 days away
from my thirty-day chip.

57
00:04:18,942 --> 00:04:19,943
Anyway...

58
00:04:22,237 --> 00:04:23,529
both my parents
are drunks.

59
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:29,118
I still don't feel like
I belong here.

60
00:04:33,455 --> 00:04:35,123
I go to flea markets.

61
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:37,959
I vote.

62
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:39,961
Even for, like, school board

63
00:04:39,961 --> 00:04:41,879
and Prop whatever.

64
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:45,258
I teach special ed,
for Christ's sake.

65
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:46,842
I'm not like
a Hollywood has-been

66
00:04:46,884 --> 00:04:49,928
crouched in an airport bathroom
sucking on a can of Final Net.

67
00:04:51,722 --> 00:04:54,099
So, why am I here?

68
00:04:57,435 --> 00:04:58,603
The truth?

69
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,315
The truth is I met a guy.

70
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:10,531
And if I had
to pick... a trigger,

71
00:05:12,032 --> 00:05:13,992
I'd say it was
all over this guy.

72
00:05:16,786 --> 00:05:19,289
But, whatever,
who cares how it happened?

73
00:05:20,832 --> 00:05:21,958
Bottom line is I'm here.

74
00:05:24,502 --> 00:05:26,212
I quit drinking
and guys because

75
00:05:26,253 --> 00:05:27,880
I can't be trusted
with either.

76
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,884
Thanks.

77
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:38,389
Nice going.

78
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:43,144
I'll get it right
one of these times.

79
00:05:43,227 --> 00:05:44,687
Sounded right to me.

80
00:05:44,687 --> 00:05:46,146
It was like you were telling
my story.

81
00:05:46,188 --> 00:05:47,231
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

82
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:49,149
I shared first,
I get the book's rights.

83
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:50,150
That's fair.

84
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,235
Tell me about the guy.

85
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:56,072
I don't want
to keep you from-

86
00:05:56,114 --> 00:05:57,156
What?
From what?

87
00:05:57,198 --> 00:05:59,742
The important things in life
like stapling or filing?

88
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:01,452
Oh, please!
I couldn't be more bored.

89
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,872
This thing with that guy,
you seem okay with it.

90
00:06:04,872 --> 00:06:07,875
Only to the sight-
and-hearing impaired.

91
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,710
Pull up your chair, honey.

92
00:06:09,751 --> 00:06:10,877
- This one?
- Yeah.

93
00:06:17,383 --> 00:06:19,510
So, you and your boyfriend,
you broke up.

94
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:21,846
Not a boyfriend,
I don't know.

95
00:06:21,887 --> 00:06:22,888
I don't know.

96
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,975
I don't know, but things
just got too... "too."

97
00:06:28,977 --> 00:06:30,395
I choked, I'm an alcoholic.

98
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:31,062
You do the math.

99
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:33,273
We met on a blind date
which sucked.

100
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:35,733
We became friends,

101
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,735
and now we don't speak
to each other.

102
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:39,111
So it's a happy ending.

103
00:06:39,153 --> 00:06:40,654
How did we meet?

104
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,284
It started with a phone call
from my best friend, Jackie.

105
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:48,286
John? Pick up.

106
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,373
Pick up, pick up, pick up...

107
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,001
Damn it!
Where are you?

108
00:06:55,043 --> 00:06:56,544
I'm at a pay phone

109
00:06:56,586 --> 00:06:58,587
because I can't get my shitty
cell phone to work

110
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:01,257
unless I stand on my head
with my fingers up my ass.

111
00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:05,260
Anyway...

112
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,722
what are you doing
Friday night?

113
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:10,056
Cause I met this guy, Bret,

114
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:11,558
at a furniture store
on Montana,

115
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,685
and he showed me this great
loveseat to die for.

116
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:16,270
I think I can get it wholesale.

117
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:18,814
There's just one catch...

118
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:49,175
Any luck?

119
00:07:50,552 --> 00:07:52,261
Oh! With...?

120
00:07:53,638 --> 00:07:55,097
I thought you were
looking for change

121
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:56,140
under the cushions.

122
00:07:56,182 --> 00:07:57,933
Oh, God!

123
00:07:57,975 --> 00:07:58,934
You saw me?

124
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:02,271
Yeah, the whole routine.

125
00:08:02,312 --> 00:08:04,397
Great. Now
I'm thoroughly mortified.

126
00:08:05,315 --> 00:08:07,067
You're fine,
don't worry about it.

127
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:11,779
I know. Now it's your turn
to do something humiliating.

128
00:08:11,821 --> 00:08:15,491
I work in a furniture store.
Those bases are covered.

129
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:20,120
What's humiliating about
an employee discount?

130
00:08:21,997 --> 00:08:24,291
Does that apply to
this wheely-carty thing?

131
00:08:24,332 --> 00:08:25,834
'Cause this is yummy.

132
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:28,169
A, I get 1 0% off of this crap.

133
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:29,962
And, B, I don't know
if the whole

134
00:08:30,004 --> 00:08:33,883
Clockwork Orange cum Ikea
thing is really your scene.

135
00:08:33,924 --> 00:08:35,718
Quite a salesman.

136
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:38,595
I don't know
what half this shit is.

137
00:08:38,637 --> 00:08:39,638
Okay, great!

138
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,975
You know, my heart does
beat fast for this loveseat.

139
00:08:44,017 --> 00:08:45,352
You're kidding?

140
00:08:45,393 --> 00:08:46,394
Why?
Do you hate it?

141
00:08:46,436 --> 00:08:49,480
No. It's the only thing
in the store that's mine.

142
00:08:49,522 --> 00:08:51,649
Yours?

143
00:08:51,691 --> 00:08:52,817
One of my designs.

144
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:54,860
Oh, you're a designer?

145
00:08:56,111 --> 00:08:57,905
Yeah. This is one of
my first projects.

146
00:08:57,988 --> 00:08:59,406
I love it.

147
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:00,407
Thank you.

148
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:02,701
What is the color?
Sort of a yellow-beige-yellow?

149
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:03,702
Buttercup.

150
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,869
Buttercup?

151
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:06,162
Buttercup.

152
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,169
I'm not gay, just because
I said buttercup.

153
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,004
I have this argument
with Eli all the time.

154
00:09:16,046 --> 00:09:18,298
Just because I say "buttercup,"
doesn't mean I'm gay,

155
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,300
or used to be gay,
or want to be gay.

156
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:22,719
I'm not gay,
just very particular about

157
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:24,846
the nomenclature I use
regarding my palette.

158
00:09:25,972 --> 00:09:27,265
Who's Eli?
The boyfriend?

159
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:28,391
Right.

160
00:09:28,432 --> 00:09:31,018
No, he's my best friend...

161
00:09:31,102 --> 00:09:32,895
who happens to be gay.

162
00:09:33,896 --> 00:09:35,355
- You know what I think?
- What?

163
00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:38,692
I think you're one of those guys
who flirts with a girl,

164
00:09:38,734 --> 00:09:41,278
maybe even takes her to dinner,
but when push comes to shove,

165
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:43,780
the only frenching you'll be
doing with her are her braids.

166
00:09:43,822 --> 00:09:45,698
Wow! That's pretty sassy!

167
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,575
So you've been
braided a lot lately?

168
00:09:47,617 --> 00:09:48,576
No!
I know gay men,

169
00:09:48,618 --> 00:09:50,411
- I practically invented them.
- Okay.

170
00:09:50,453 --> 00:09:52,204
There's no such thing
as a straight guy

171
00:09:52,246 --> 00:09:54,873
with a gay best friend
he's not fucking.

172
00:09:54,915 --> 00:09:56,291
Don't give me that look.

173
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:59,794
My friend, Tom, who is single,
if you're interested,

174
00:09:59,836 --> 00:10:01,421
he's the first to agree.

175
00:10:01,463 --> 00:10:02,422
Right. Okay.

176
00:10:02,464 --> 00:10:05,842
Thanks for the tip, but I'm not
particularly interested in Tom.

177
00:10:07,093 --> 00:10:09,553
Unless, of course,
he has your eyes.

178
00:10:19,396 --> 00:10:21,898
So, there's actually a chance
that he didn't hate my guts

179
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,775
and I could be having
his children on that

180
00:10:23,816 --> 00:10:27,778
kick-ass buttercup loveseat.
Which is where you come in.

181
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:28,821
It was, like, great!

182
00:10:28,863 --> 00:10:32,074
Next she'll ask me to blow
some guy from "3 Day Blinds."

183
00:10:32,116 --> 00:10:34,951
In the movies, when a guy's
in the supermarket

184
00:10:34,993 --> 00:10:37,704
and he accidentally bumps
shopping carts

185
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:39,456
- with the love of his life?
- Uh-huh.

186
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,499
The last few times
I've bumped carts with anyone

187
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,168
they looked to be
fresh off the special bus.

188
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:46,420
That is why I let my friends
fix me up.

189
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,348
- ( beep )
- Eli, are you there? Buddy?

190
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:01,976
That's right. There's
an X-Files marathon on.

191
00:11:02,018 --> 00:11:05,021
I cannot believe I'm friends
with a trekkie, it's pathetic.

192
00:11:05,062 --> 00:11:07,106
I am not a trekkie!
You got that?

193
00:11:07,148 --> 00:11:08,148
I just like the X-Files.

194
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,192
I believe the truth
is out there, don't you?

195
00:11:10,275 --> 00:11:12,653
Whatever,
I fully hooked you up.

196
00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:14,446
You have a date
on Friday night.

197
00:11:14,488 --> 00:11:16,364
Wait a minute!
What?

198
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:18,867
That's right. Your losing streak
is over, my man.

199
00:11:18,908 --> 00:11:20,243
He's a tall stud,
a big guy.

200
00:11:20,284 --> 00:11:22,537
Okay, you always say that.
It's like entry-level.

201
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:23,871
It means he's got nipples.

202
00:11:23,913 --> 00:11:25,122
Maybe that'd be a step up.

203
00:11:25,164 --> 00:11:26,165
Ha ha, that's funny.

204
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:28,292
His friend, Jackie, came
into the store,

205
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,668
I completely hit it off.

206
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,295
Yikes! Let me tell you,
she's got unbelievable KB.

207
00:11:32,337 --> 00:11:33,797
What is that, killer butt?

208
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:34,923
No, killer boobs.

209
00:11:34,965 --> 00:11:37,175
She told me about
her friend, Tom,

210
00:11:37,217 --> 00:11:38,676
sounds like a nice guy.

211
00:11:38,676 --> 00:11:41,637
I lied and said you were
a great guy. I told her about you.

212
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:42,638
That's real nice.

213
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,181
Now you two have
to go out Friday.

214
00:11:44,265 --> 00:11:45,307
Wait a minute! Says who?

215
00:11:47,142 --> 00:11:48,143
Can I call you back?

216
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:50,479
I'm at my loser
gay friend's place.

217
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,939
Funny.

218
00:11:52,981 --> 00:11:56,776
It didn't go so well
last time with... Richard, was it?

219
00:11:57,944 --> 00:12:00,863
Rita, from UPS!
She was a woman!

220
00:12:00,863 --> 00:12:02,156
Whatever!
She's still gay!

221
00:12:02,198 --> 00:12:04,033
That's your problem,
you're so picky.

222
00:12:04,074 --> 00:12:06,118
You, yourself, said
she had KB.

223
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,244
Killer boobs?

224
00:12:07,286 --> 00:12:08,704
No, butt.

225
00:12:08,745 --> 00:12:10,664
The whole initial thing
has got to stop.

226
00:12:10,705 --> 00:12:12,874
And, PS, I never said KB,
I said KGB.

227
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,000
Killer garlic breath.

228
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:19,922
Bottom line, I made
a reservation for you, for Tom,

229
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:22,383
Friday night, Annette's, 8:00,
be there, be square.

230
00:12:22,424 --> 00:12:23,676
I hate it when people say that

231
00:12:23,717 --> 00:12:26,803
'cause even when I'm there,
I'm square, so where's the incentive?

232
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:28,597
He's a teacher, sounds like
a great guy.

233
00:12:28,638 --> 00:12:30,640
Maybe you'll get lucky,
have to stay after class.

234
00:12:30,682 --> 00:12:32,350
Detention?
You'd like that.

235
00:12:32,392 --> 00:12:35,061
- That's really funny.
- Discipline, gravity boots...

236
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:36,437
Of course, you went.

237
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,481
Yup, I went.

238
00:12:40,483 --> 00:12:42,443
( upbeat music playing )

239
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:49,950
- She landed on my roof, -

240
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:51,993
- Mad love from Venus -

241
00:12:52,077 --> 00:12:54,037
- Her ship ran out of gas, -

242
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:55,913
- Fast as lightning,
love came between us -

243
00:12:55,955 --> 00:12:58,416
- Fashion girl
from outer space, -

244
00:12:58,457 --> 00:13:01,168
- Chorus: I'll never do you wrong. -

245
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,252
- Future love! -

246
00:13:02,294 --> 00:13:03,670
- That's right, that's right,
that's right -

247
00:13:03,712 --> 00:13:05,631
- Making future love tonight -

248
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:07,883
- That's right, that's right,
that's right -

249
00:13:07,924 --> 00:13:09,968
- Making future love tonight -

250
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,345
- It's all right if I love you -

251
00:13:12,387 --> 00:13:14,138
- It's all right if I don't -

252
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,932
- I'm not afraid
that you're running away -

253
00:13:15,973 --> 00:13:18,351
- 'Cause I got the feeling
honey that you won't -

254
00:13:18,392 --> 00:13:20,936
- Super sonic safety valve, -

255
00:13:20,978 --> 00:13:23,313
- Chorus: I'll never do you wrong -

256
00:13:23,397 --> 00:13:27,484
- That's right, that's right,
making future love tonight -

257
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:29,027
- That's right, that's right. -

258
00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:37,076
Eli: I didn't have
high hopes for this date.

259
00:13:37,118 --> 00:13:39,203
Receptionist: You didn't have
anything to lose.

260
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:41,955
Eli: I know. Honestly,
all I kept thinking was,

261
00:13:41,997 --> 00:13:43,332
"I hope he doesn't smoke."

262
00:13:49,838 --> 00:13:52,507
I'm going to get another drink.
Do you want something?

263
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:54,342
Yes, I'd like another
seltzer with lime.

264
00:13:54,383 --> 00:13:56,427
- Seltzer with lime.
- Make it a wine spritzer.

265
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:57,636
Spritzer. Got it.

266
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,389
On second thought,
can I get a Seven and Seven?

267
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,432
Rocks with a twist.

268
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:03,475
Are you sure?

269
00:14:03,517 --> 00:14:05,602
Yeah, I always get
a Seven and Seven.

270
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,270
Hi, we're going to have-

271
00:14:07,312 --> 00:14:09,814
Absolut martini up, two olives,
make it a little dirty.

272
00:14:12,358 --> 00:14:13,734
You?

273
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:40,092
Do you like movies?

274
00:14:42,469 --> 00:14:43,929
Yeah, I like movies.

275
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:44,929
Yeah, me too.

276
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:47,974
I think it was gay night
on cable last night.

277
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:49,308
"In and Out" was on again.

278
00:14:50,852 --> 00:14:52,311
Uh-huh.

279
00:14:52,353 --> 00:14:56,023
I thought it was great to see
a movie like that with two guys.

280
00:14:56,065 --> 00:15:02,154
Not with two guys... two guys who...
you know, in the movie-

281
00:15:02,195 --> 00:15:03,154
I hated it.

282
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:07,283
Oh, yeah, me too.

283
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:09,869
I thought it was light, fun.

284
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:12,955
- Fun?
- Yeah.

285
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:16,458
Fun to see Kevin Kline get on
his sorry-ass middle-aged knees

286
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:19,544
and give us a big old
Hollywood blowjob by catering to

287
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,797
every clichéed homophobic
stereotypical idea of

288
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,090
what it means to be gay?

289
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:27,218
Without having the decency
or the courtesy,

290
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,637
or even just the balls
to drop a little trou

291
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,429
and show us his.

292
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,473
Wait a minute, come on!

293
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,934
I thought it was nice to see
a guy coming out to his family,

294
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,395
his friends, not to mention
his fiancée.

295
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,273
His fiancée? This loser bitch
has been waiting her whole life

296
00:15:41,314 --> 00:15:44,025
to marry this Nellie barber
loving, self-hating,

297
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:46,819
geriatric English teacher
who can't get it up for her,

298
00:15:46,861 --> 00:15:48,821
and we're supposed to
feel sorry for her?

299
00:15:48,863 --> 00:15:50,865
Aw.
No fucking way!

300
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:51,866
I mean, you do the math.

301
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:53,575
Where's the waiter
with my drink?

302
00:15:55,077 --> 00:15:56,078
You want anything?

303
00:15:58,288 --> 00:16:00,540
I'm not even going to mention
"Bird Cage."

304
00:16:07,338 --> 00:16:09,006
- Can I get a diet coke?
- Sure.

305
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:12,301
All right. What was
your favorite movie of all time?

306
00:16:12,384 --> 00:16:15,262
Let's just start with that.

307
00:16:15,304 --> 00:16:18,056
I'm not a big fan
of the "favorites" game,

308
00:16:18,098 --> 00:16:19,766
so why don't you go first?

309
00:16:21,226 --> 00:16:22,894
Oh. Okay.

310
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:28,732
I know it sounds corny and
cliché, but I have to say

311
00:16:28,774 --> 00:16:30,025
"Gone with the Wind."

312
00:16:31,068 --> 00:16:32,027
I never saw it.

313
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:33,612
Yeah, right.

314
00:16:33,654 --> 00:16:35,739
I didn't. I never saw
"Gone with the Wind."

315
00:16:35,781 --> 00:16:37,032
You're kidding, right?

316
00:16:37,073 --> 00:16:38,533
No, I'm not kidding.

317
00:16:38,575 --> 00:16:39,868
Come on!

318
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:42,370
- I never saw the movie.
- You never saw the movie?

319
00:16:42,412 --> 00:16:44,080
No, I never-

320
00:16:44,163 --> 00:16:45,122
Okay, fine.

321
00:16:45,164 --> 00:16:46,374
Want me to say
I saw the movie?

322
00:16:46,457 --> 00:16:48,417
I will.
I saw the movie.

323
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:50,377
It was the best movie
I've ever seen.

324
00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:54,256
Especially that part where
Red Buttons is up on a hill

325
00:16:54,297 --> 00:16:55,298
with Charlotte?

326
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,259
Oh my God, you are scaring me.

327
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,052
What do you want me say?

328
00:16:59,094 --> 00:17:01,095
I'm not a big fan of
black and white movies.

329
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,058
Relax, relax.

330
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:11,146
I saw "Family" 1 5 times.
Does that help?

331
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:16,109
It's a start.

332
00:17:23,115 --> 00:17:24,075
KE.

333
00:17:25,326 --> 00:17:27,453
- What?
- What?

334
00:17:27,494 --> 00:17:28,579
What did you just say?

335
00:17:29,538 --> 00:17:30,497
Nothing.

336
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:31,581
You said something.

337
00:17:31,623 --> 00:17:32,791
No, I didn't.

338
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,709
Yeah, you did.
You said "K," what is that?

339
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:39,714
It's nothing.
It's nothing.

340
00:17:39,756 --> 00:17:41,424
It's stupid.

341
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:43,968
It's initial talk.

342
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:45,511
Bret and I have done it
for years.

343
00:17:45,553 --> 00:17:47,930
It's stupid. It means nothing.
Trust me.

344
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:48,972
So I just took a hit.

345
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:50,015
No, you didn't.

346
00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:52,476
Tom, believe me.
I swear to you.

347
00:17:52,517 --> 00:17:53,768
Oh, damn it.

348
00:17:58,064 --> 00:18:00,024
It means...

349
00:18:00,107 --> 00:18:01,317
killer eyes, okay?

350
00:18:13,536 --> 00:18:16,206
I'm gonna go, it's late,
and uh...

351
00:18:16,247 --> 00:18:21,836
Yeah, let's you and I go
on our way- ways.

352
00:18:21,877 --> 00:18:23,546
On our ways, separate,
you and me.

353
00:18:25,214 --> 00:18:27,007
- Here, let's split it.
- No, I got it.

354
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:29,051
- No, let's split it.
- No, I want to do this.

355
00:18:29,134 --> 00:18:31,136
- Please.
- Let me pay.

356
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:32,929
- Let me just split it.
- Let me do this.

357
00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:34,889
- Let me pay for my own.
- Just go!

358
00:18:34,889 --> 00:18:35,890
Going.

359
00:18:37,892 --> 00:18:38,893
He hated me.

360
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:40,978
It was like I activated
his gag reflex.

361
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,732
That is the last time I let you
fix me up, you got that?

362
00:18:44,773 --> 00:18:47,109
Next date I go on will
cost me $2 for the 1 st minute

363
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,693
and $1 .50
each additional minutes.

364
00:18:48,735 --> 00:18:49,986
Did he mention
me and Jackie?

365
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,404
What?
No. It didn't come up.

366
00:18:51,404 --> 00:18:53,406
Are you sure the guy
was even gay?

367
00:18:53,406 --> 00:18:54,741
Are you kidding?

368
00:18:54,782 --> 00:18:57,535
I don't know, with you...

369
00:18:57,618 --> 00:18:59,370
How many straight guys
pretend their gay?

370
00:18:59,453 --> 00:19:00,913
- Besides you?
- Hello!

371
00:19:00,955 --> 00:19:02,164
He didn't
mention me?

372
00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:04,708
You want eggs?
I'll add another.

373
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,751
Are there eggs?

374
00:19:05,751 --> 00:19:06,752
- Yeah!
- Relax.

375
00:19:06,752 --> 00:19:07,753
You're becoming crazy.

376
00:19:07,794 --> 00:19:09,045
You've been whipping
for 20 minutes.

377
00:19:09,087 --> 00:19:11,131
Your mother told me
you would be like this.

378
00:19:11,172 --> 00:19:13,091
My mom called you again?

379
00:19:13,091 --> 00:19:14,467
What did you tell her?

380
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:16,469
She's concerned about you.

381
00:19:16,511 --> 00:19:18,012
You never talk to the woman.

382
00:19:18,054 --> 00:19:20,181
She thinks you're becoming
a big loser.

383
00:19:20,222 --> 00:19:22,808
That's nice, that's great.

384
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,184
Thanks, thanks for that.

385
00:19:24,226 --> 00:19:26,603
It's easy for her to say.
I know what's out there.

386
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:28,021
Guys with
bad hair plugs,

387
00:19:28,063 --> 00:19:29,356
staples in their dicks,

388
00:19:29,397 --> 00:19:30,940
Beanie Baby collections
or worse.

389
00:19:31,024 --> 00:19:33,568
- Worse?
- Oh, there's worse.

390
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:36,112
Come on, it'll be
so much better next time.

391
00:19:36,195 --> 00:19:38,114
There won't be a next time.

392
00:19:38,155 --> 00:19:42,409
Unless his name is
Ben, Jerry, or Jose Cuervo.

393
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:44,953
Uh-huh. Like you haven't all
ready had those guys.

394
00:19:44,953 --> 00:19:47,163
And their brothers.

395
00:19:47,205 --> 00:19:49,124
Haven't you ever wondered
what it's like

396
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:53,086
to be with the same guy
for more than five minutes?

397
00:19:53,127 --> 00:19:56,088
The guys I meet, five minutes
is all it takes.

398
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,840
Charming.

399
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,801
More importantly...

400
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,554
what did Eli say about me?

401
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:06,348
Is it going to happen
with Bret?

402
00:20:06,431 --> 00:20:07,891
I've no idea.
He didn't mention it.

403
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:08,975
Oh.

404
00:20:10,268 --> 00:20:11,227
Like I care.

405
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:15,689
Maybe I should call Bret
and find out

406
00:20:15,731 --> 00:20:16,982
what Eli said about your date.

407
00:20:18,025 --> 00:20:20,402
I couldn't care less.

408
00:20:20,444 --> 00:20:22,237
Right. Right.

409
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:24,156
We officially don't care.

410
00:20:24,197 --> 00:20:26,282
I get it. Yeah.

411
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:29,285
I definitely
am not going to call.

412
00:20:29,327 --> 00:20:30,370
Where're you going?

413
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:33,539
Home, to officially not call.

414
00:20:33,581 --> 00:20:36,041
No, no, no. You were supposed
to stay here and watch

415
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,918
Lifetime Television
for women and gay men.

416
00:20:38,002 --> 00:20:39,086
Uh, no.

417
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:41,380
It's Joan Van Arc and
not without my nose job.

418
00:20:41,463 --> 00:20:44,341
Oh, angel,
I've all ready lived that movie.

419
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:46,259
That shit people say
about finding the one?

420
00:20:46,301 --> 00:20:47,760
I'm sick of it.

421
00:20:47,844 --> 00:20:49,887
Tom certainly isn't.

422
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:51,847
I don't think I'll ever
meet the one.

423
00:20:51,847 --> 00:20:53,349
Your whole problem is

424
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:55,142
there is no such thing
as "the one."

425
00:20:55,184 --> 00:20:56,310
You're such a liar.

426
00:20:56,352 --> 00:20:59,062
Two seconds ago you told me
this girl Jackie is the one.

427
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:00,314
I met her one time.

428
00:21:00,355 --> 00:21:02,357
She could be the one.
Or one of the ones.

429
00:21:02,357 --> 00:21:03,608
There's notjust one one.

430
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,860
There's fractions of one,
half ones, quarter ones.

431
00:21:05,902 --> 00:21:08,488
The idea is to make yourself
open to someone.

432
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:10,114
Perhaps Tom is a one.

433
00:21:12,658 --> 00:21:14,743
Are you going to the flea
market with me tomorrow?

434
00:21:14,827 --> 00:21:17,913
No, sweetie. By tomorrow, I'm
hoping to have plans with a man

435
00:21:17,996 --> 00:21:19,498
who'll appreciate me
for my body,

436
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:22,626
notjust my brains and wit
and sense of style.

437
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:23,668
So, Dad's in town.

438
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,336
You're disgusting.

439
00:21:25,378 --> 00:21:27,463
Why don't you take a date
to the flea market?

440
00:21:27,505 --> 00:21:28,464
Ugh!

441
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:30,091
That is why
you never go steady.

442
00:21:30,132 --> 00:21:32,551
I haven't gone steady
since the seventh grade.

443
00:21:32,593 --> 00:21:33,677
You do the math.

444
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:35,846
Besides, he kept saying,
"You do the math,"

445
00:21:35,888 --> 00:21:37,097
even if it made no sense.

446
00:21:37,139 --> 00:21:38,473
What a turn off!

447
00:21:38,515 --> 00:21:39,474
What's a turn on?

448
00:21:39,516 --> 00:21:41,351
Per your mother,
you haven't had a hard-on

449
00:21:41,393 --> 00:21:42,435
since you saw the Nutcracker

450
00:21:42,477 --> 00:21:44,270
at the Jewish Community Center
in the first grade.

451
00:21:44,354 --> 00:21:45,897
- You talk about my sex life?
- What sex life?

452
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,482
- I have one!
- Uh-huh.

453
00:21:47,565 --> 00:21:48,733
- It counts.
- Right.

454
00:21:48,816 --> 00:21:50,776
I spent 1 0 years learning
which buttons to push,

455
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,486
now I just look at myself
and I come.

456
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,918
( music playing )

457
00:22:10,086 --> 00:22:13,672
- Everybody's looking for
something -

458
00:22:13,714 --> 00:22:17,717
- Step right up and tell 'em
what it's all about -

459
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,679
- Don't you worry
'bout nothin' -

460
00:22:21,763 --> 00:22:23,014
- If you see what you like -

461
00:22:23,097 --> 00:22:26,017
- I'm sure we'll work it out -

462
00:22:26,058 --> 00:22:30,020
- I'll come and see you
on Sundays -

463
00:22:30,062 --> 00:22:34,107
- Eastside, westside,
uptown or down -

464
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:38,111
- And all your problems
will disappear -

465
00:22:38,153 --> 00:22:40,947
- When you lay
your money down -

466
00:22:44,325 --> 00:22:47,912
- Let's make a deal, man. -

467
00:22:47,953 --> 00:22:48,954
Hey!

468
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,040
Hey!

469
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:53,917
Hey, how are you doing?

470
00:22:54,001 --> 00:22:56,378
I'm good.
How are you?

471
00:22:56,419 --> 00:22:59,714
Yeah, good.

472
00:22:59,756 --> 00:23:01,299
You look good.

473
00:23:01,341 --> 00:23:04,051
God, thanks.

474
00:23:04,093 --> 00:23:06,262
No, no, really.

475
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:08,305
So, you were lying
the first time?

476
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:09,973
What?

477
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:12,100
No, you've got that fresh

478
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:15,312
Sunday-morning-read-the-paper-
cup-of-coffee look.

479
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:16,855
Here I thought I had that stale

480
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,440
Sunday morning-hangover-choke-
on-my-own-vomit thing going.

481
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,363
What are you here for?

482
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,615
Looking for anything
in particular?

483
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,201
Yeah. I'm looking for
a vintage martini set.

484
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:35,163
The shaker and the glasses.
The whole thing.

485
00:23:37,665 --> 00:23:40,877
How about you?
You just browsing?

486
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:42,378
Me? Are you kidding?

487
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,379
I'd go nuts.

488
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,714
I have to look for one thing
and just one thing.

489
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:48,133
And that would be what?

490
00:23:51,386 --> 00:23:52,888
A bathroom, actually.

491
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:54,681
I bet they don't have
bathrooms.

492
00:23:54,723 --> 00:23:56,891
Probablyjust porta-potties.
God, I hate those.

493
00:23:56,933 --> 00:23:58,268
My parents rented
four of them

494
00:23:58,351 --> 00:23:59,519
for my sister's bat mitzvah.

495
00:24:00,603 --> 00:24:02,396
You didn't come here
for a bathroom.

496
00:24:02,438 --> 00:24:03,481
I didn't?

497
00:24:09,027 --> 00:24:10,612
Okay.

498
00:24:10,654 --> 00:24:13,281
I'm looking for an original
Cornelius action figure.

499
00:24:13,323 --> 00:24:14,949
You know, from
"Planet of the Apes"?

500
00:24:17,243 --> 00:24:19,078
You're yanking my chain, right?

501
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,496
Actually, no I'm not.

502
00:24:20,538 --> 00:24:22,415
And I really hate
that expression.

503
00:24:22,456 --> 00:24:23,874
Nice seeing you.
See you around.

504
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:24,959
No, no don't.

505
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,710
Come on,
have a sense of humor.

506
00:24:26,752 --> 00:24:29,212
You're funny.
I'm not laughing at you.

507
00:24:29,212 --> 00:24:31,381
Not funny bad,
you're funny good.

508
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,802
Why don't we
go grab a cup of coffee,

509
00:24:35,885 --> 00:24:37,470
then I'll help you
find your dolly?

510
00:24:37,553 --> 00:24:38,513
Action figure!

511
00:24:38,554 --> 00:24:40,723
Is itjust the apes,
or do you have Betsy Wetsy too?

512
00:24:40,765 --> 00:24:42,558
Jackie didn't say
you collected dolls.

513
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,852
Interesting. Bret didn't tell me
you were an asshole.

514
00:24:47,562 --> 00:24:49,606
Speaking of which,
what's up with those two?

515
00:25:01,158 --> 00:25:03,118
- Hi.
- Hi.

516
00:25:04,787 --> 00:25:08,748
I thought you should know-
they hated each other.

517
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,752
Oh... right,
more than life itself.

518
00:25:15,797 --> 00:25:18,549
N-no fucking chemistry.

519
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:30,977
I had the biggest
"Planet of the Apes" collection

520
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:33,021
until the sixth grade
when my parents made me sell it

521
00:25:33,062 --> 00:25:35,189
at a garage sale.
They were afraid

522
00:25:35,231 --> 00:25:37,983
it was going to adversely affect
my psycho-sexual development.

523
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:40,152
They're both shrinks.

524
00:25:40,236 --> 00:25:41,904
- Know what did it?
- What?

525
00:25:41,945 --> 00:25:44,406
Affect your psycho whatever?

526
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,449
I'm gay, aren't I?

527
00:25:45,532 --> 00:25:47,242
So the apes made you gay?

528
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:47,742
I don't know.

529
00:25:47,784 --> 00:25:49,160
What is that, the ape theory?

530
00:25:49,202 --> 00:25:52,955
You've got a half-naked
Charleton Heston in a cage-

531
00:25:52,997 --> 00:25:54,081
Where he belongs.

532
00:25:54,123 --> 00:25:56,125
plus, my huge crush
on Roddy McDowall,

533
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:57,751
and those cute little
leather outfits?

534
00:25:57,793 --> 00:26:00,754
That, my friend, is a gay,
pre-teen Happy Meal.

535
00:26:01,713 --> 00:26:04,424
- Do you have any martini sets?
- I'm afraid not.

536
00:26:04,466 --> 00:26:06,635
I gotta admit, I don't even know
what a martini set looks like.

537
00:26:06,676 --> 00:26:09,471
I wouldn't know a martini
if it bit me in the ass.

538
00:26:09,512 --> 00:26:10,972
It shouldn't, if you know
how to make them.

539
00:26:11,014 --> 00:26:12,849
I take it you do?

540
00:26:12,932 --> 00:26:14,433
In my house, you had to.

541
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:15,726
I couldn't tie my shoes
until I was 1 0,

542
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,186
but I could make a martini.

543
00:26:17,228 --> 00:26:20,147
I was Isaac on our sinking
little Love Boat.

544
00:26:22,858 --> 00:26:25,652
Thank you, sweetheart.

545
00:26:25,694 --> 00:26:27,404
This is perfect.

546
00:26:27,445 --> 00:26:32,116
Tell me, have you met any nice
girls at school this year?

547
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:35,119
Yeah, they're nice.

548
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:37,538
Have you given any thought
to what we talked about?

549
00:26:37,579 --> 00:26:38,956
None of the other fifth graders

550
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,624
know what they'll do
after high school.

551
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:43,502
What do I care about a bunch
of pansy fifth graders

552
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:45,712
with silver spoons
in their mouths?

553
00:26:45,795 --> 00:26:50,091
I sorta like the idea of
teaching. Teaching sounds good.

554
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:53,969
That's terrific, honey.

555
00:26:54,011 --> 00:26:55,804
( mother chuckling )

556
00:26:55,846 --> 00:26:57,973
I can't remember them
without a drink in their hand.

557
00:26:59,057 --> 00:27:02,853
When my father used to pitch
baseballs to me in the backyard,

558
00:27:02,894 --> 00:27:04,771
he never spilled a drop.

559
00:27:04,813 --> 00:27:06,981
My God, I can't even imagine.

560
00:27:07,023 --> 00:27:08,024
Your parents didn't drink?

561
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:10,359
No, we never played games
in the backyard.

562
00:27:10,401 --> 00:27:11,485
Never?

563
00:27:11,527 --> 00:27:13,529
First of all,
we didn't have a backyard.

564
00:27:13,571 --> 00:27:16,949
And second of all, the closest
we ever came to a game was...

565
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,576
the "feel wheel."

566
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,786
Rage is at the top.

567
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,163
Then we move down

568
00:27:23,204 --> 00:27:27,542
to frustration,
confusion, loneliness.

569
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:32,713
On the other side we have
loving, affectionate, silly.

570
00:27:33,756 --> 00:27:34,715
Eli, you go first.

571
00:27:34,715 --> 00:27:37,134
Take your name,

572
00:27:37,176 --> 00:27:40,220
and put it on the emotion
you're feeling right now.

573
00:27:40,262 --> 00:27:42,347
That's right, Eli.
Don't think. Look inside.

574
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:43,181
- What are you feeling?
- Right now, go.

575
00:27:43,223 --> 00:27:46,017
Don't think- go!

576
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:47,101
Go!

577
00:27:47,143 --> 00:27:49,478
Do I have to, Dr. Wyckoff?

578
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,814
Mother: Can you do it
for Mommy?

579
00:28:00,905 --> 00:28:02,532
You'd be walking,
thinking,

580
00:28:02,574 --> 00:28:06,327
"Gee, I feel happy," and you'd
put your flag on the wheel?

581
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:08,704
No, no, it was just...

582
00:28:08,746 --> 00:28:10,539
something my parents
wanted us to do

583
00:28:10,581 --> 00:28:12,416
so that they would feel
more enlightened.

584
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:16,920
Like getting us to say penis
and vagina at the dinner table.

585
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:19,422
You know, so that we'd feel
comfortable talking about sex?

586
00:28:19,422 --> 00:28:22,884
It's probably why now I prefer
"pee-pee" and "who-who."

587
00:28:22,926 --> 00:28:25,511
More pee-pee
than who-who, I'd imagine.

588
00:28:25,595 --> 00:28:27,555
Does it show?

589
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:32,101
I don't think that game would
have been a hit in my house,

590
00:28:32,142 --> 00:28:34,603
unless there was section
on the wheel for thirsty.

591
00:28:34,645 --> 00:28:38,315
There was a section
on the wheel for scared...

592
00:28:38,356 --> 00:28:42,068
but you'd have had
to share that one with me.

593
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:01,502
No chance on the Eli
and Tom thing?

594
00:29:01,544 --> 00:29:04,297
What a pain.
The gays are so picky.

595
00:29:04,338 --> 00:29:07,967
No, it's Eli. He's got
the worse D.K. on the planet.

596
00:29:08,008 --> 00:29:10,761
Donna Karan?

597
00:29:10,803 --> 00:29:13,722
No, "dating karma."
It sucks.

598
00:29:13,764 --> 00:29:17,183
He told me that, A, he thinks he
insulted Tom a hundred times,

599
00:29:17,225 --> 00:29:20,228
and B, that he's straight.

600
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:23,356
Tom is just a freak.

601
00:29:23,397 --> 00:29:26,066
He officially hates any guy
that he likes,

602
00:29:26,108 --> 00:29:27,860
or worse, who likes him.

603
00:29:27,902 --> 00:29:29,820
What, dude?

604
00:29:29,862 --> 00:29:32,614
Welcome to the wonderful
world of self-hate.

605
00:29:32,698 --> 00:29:34,658
And he's not even Jewish.

606
00:29:35,784 --> 00:29:38,578
What on God's earth is this?

607
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,289
That's the ugliest thing
I've seen in my entire life.

608
00:29:58,972 --> 00:30:00,932
( clattering )

609
00:30:02,516 --> 00:30:04,935
- 'Morning.
- 'Morning.

610
00:30:07,021 --> 00:30:10,148
What's the hurry?

611
00:30:10,232 --> 00:30:13,193
Today is decoupage day
at school and I'm late.

612
00:30:13,235 --> 00:30:15,820
Okay.

613
00:30:15,862 --> 00:30:18,239
Listen, I just...

614
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:21,617
want to apologize
for yesterday, and last night,

615
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:23,619
and it shouldn't
have happened.

616
00:30:24,662 --> 00:30:25,913
Oh.

617
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:28,373
I feel we got off
to a really good start,

618
00:30:28,373 --> 00:30:30,834
but then I feel like
I fucked things up.

619
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:34,087
So I promise it won't ever
happen again.

620
00:30:34,129 --> 00:30:35,922
Good, I-

621
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:38,341
We shouldn't have.

622
00:30:38,382 --> 00:30:41,135
Anyway, it was both
of our faults, so...

623
00:30:41,218 --> 00:30:44,972
No, yeah, so let's pretend
it never happened.

624
00:30:46,056 --> 00:30:47,099
Perfect.

625
00:30:47,182 --> 00:30:49,434
Great. I'll see you later.

626
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:05,908
- Hey.
- How you doing?

627
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:18,461
( modem connecting )

628
00:31:44,651 --> 00:31:47,404
We had a great time.
I don't get it.

629
00:31:47,487 --> 00:31:52,033
Looked like you did get it-
something called "laid."

630
00:31:52,116 --> 00:31:55,036
FYI, gay guys don't necessarily
play the same bases

631
00:31:55,077 --> 00:31:56,037
that straight guys do.

632
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,830
It's still fucking, dude.

633
00:31:57,872 --> 00:32:00,374
Hello, gentlemen.

634
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:01,792
You don't mind if the brother
hangs out, do you?

635
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,586
- I had him fixed.
- Do I have a choice?

636
00:32:04,628 --> 00:32:06,004
I don't get the double standard.

637
00:32:06,046 --> 00:32:07,839
Guys can do all kinds
of things with women,

638
00:32:07,881 --> 00:32:09,507
but they don't call it sex
unless they actually fuck.

639
00:32:09,549 --> 00:32:10,758
Like sex with interns.

640
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,761
I'm notjudging you.
It's just sex.

641
00:32:13,803 --> 00:32:14,804
I'm not being defensive,

642
00:32:14,804 --> 00:32:16,597
I'm trying to explain to you
that a guy can get together

643
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:17,932
with another guy and do all
kinds of things,

644
00:32:17,973 --> 00:32:19,099
without necessarily...
you know.

645
00:32:19,183 --> 00:32:21,935
Right. That's enough.

646
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:24,187
It's a big step.
I know couples who have never,

647
00:32:24,271 --> 00:32:26,106
and probably will
never actually...

648
00:32:26,147 --> 00:32:27,649
NT- new topic.

649
00:32:27,649 --> 00:32:30,568
What is with you? You were
never this squeamish in college.

650
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:31,569
That's because you were
dating women.

651
00:32:31,652 --> 00:32:34,780
It's the same thing
if you don't count the vaginas.

652
00:32:34,822 --> 00:32:37,783
I count them. Four, so far.

653
00:32:37,825 --> 00:32:39,159
Know what, Mitch?

654
00:32:39,201 --> 00:32:42,037
It doesn't count if they have
inflate nozzles.

655
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:46,541
It's not like you picked them up
at Ye Old Cock 'N Balls,

656
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:48,585
and got out the butter spray

657
00:32:48,626 --> 00:32:49,460
and choke collar
and the whole thing.

658
00:32:49,502 --> 00:32:52,630
You spent an afternoon together.
Obviously he likes you.

659
00:32:52,672 --> 00:32:54,673
Right.

660
00:32:56,133 --> 00:32:57,843
Fuck, these are new.

661
00:32:57,885 --> 00:33:00,137
What's the matter?
Are you cranky?

662
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,472
I don't want to do this anymore.
That's fine. That's great.

663
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,349
You did a terrific job.

664
00:33:04,391 --> 00:33:06,559
Listen, what are you doing
on Friday night?

665
00:33:06,601 --> 00:33:07,644
Are you gonna go out
with the guy?

666
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:10,313
I don't know.
Why, did Jackie say something?

667
00:33:10,354 --> 00:33:11,939
I don't know, but if you come
on Friday night,

668
00:33:11,981 --> 00:33:13,190
she can tell you herself.

669
00:33:13,232 --> 00:33:14,316
I'm not doing that.
That's so seventh grade.

670
00:33:14,358 --> 00:33:16,944
You'll catch up.

671
00:33:16,985 --> 00:33:20,197
- Did she invite Tom?
- No, it's just us,

672
00:33:20,238 --> 00:33:23,158
it'll be fine.
7:00 Friday night, all right?

673
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:24,743
All right. Take this.

674
00:33:24,784 --> 00:33:25,493
Have a Valerian or something.
Take a nap.

675
00:33:25,577 --> 00:33:29,539
He's too intense.
I like him as a friend, but-

676
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,623
Bullshit.

677
00:33:30,706 --> 00:33:36,086
That is just fear of intimacy,
which is so 1991 . Pause.

678
00:33:36,128 --> 00:33:38,630
- Marie?
- Yeah?

679
00:33:38,672 --> 00:33:41,800
Put the headphones on.
The headphones.

680
00:33:41,841 --> 00:33:43,843
There you go.

681
00:33:43,885 --> 00:33:48,514
Nice, Marie, but I need
more smile and less sell.

682
00:33:48,556 --> 00:33:49,473
Have fun.

683
00:33:49,515 --> 00:33:54,019
Great... fun, right.
Top notch.

684
00:33:54,061 --> 00:33:56,063
The way you did
in the audition, remember?

685
00:33:56,063 --> 00:33:57,689
The reason we hired you?

686
00:33:57,731 --> 00:34:01,693
Right, absolutely.
Good note. Really good note.

687
00:34:01,735 --> 00:34:03,862
Great.

688
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:06,697
"New Vita-Power Energy Bars

689
00:34:06,739 --> 00:34:09,241
with tasty, chewy goodness
in every bite."

690
00:34:09,283 --> 00:34:11,744
I'm just glad you met a guy
with half a brain in his head.

691
00:34:11,744 --> 00:34:15,706
Let me find the love in that.
Oh, right, there is none!

692
00:34:15,747 --> 00:34:17,958
I'm not the one who
fell in love with a guy

693
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:20,210
who could only get a job
selling sperm samples

694
00:34:20,251 --> 00:34:22,003
and doing experimental
drug research.

695
00:34:22,045 --> 00:34:23,630
Wasn't he allergic?

696
00:34:23,671 --> 00:34:26,174
Yes, but he was cute
and you know it.

697
00:34:26,215 --> 00:34:27,508
Yeah, when the hives cleared up.

698
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:31,345
"...during and after
your living and giving life."

699
00:34:31,387 --> 00:34:33,055
Pause.

700
00:34:33,097 --> 00:34:34,640
- Sweetie?
- Yeah?

701
00:34:34,723 --> 00:34:38,351
What are you doing?
You're not Kathleen Turner, okay?

702
00:34:38,435 --> 00:34:42,855
No, I'm not. I'm not
Kathleen Turner. That's right.

703
00:34:42,939 --> 00:34:46,234
I'm me. Is that what you're
saying? I should be me?

704
00:34:46,275 --> 00:34:49,528
No, what I'm saying is that this
isn't Blue Cross, Blue Shield-

705
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,821
it's an energy snack.

706
00:34:50,863 --> 00:34:53,574
So why don't we have,
I don't know... energy?

707
00:34:53,615 --> 00:34:56,201
Energy! Of course!
You're right.

708
00:34:56,243 --> 00:34:59,829
Because it's Vita-Power,
and "Vita" means life.

709
00:34:59,871 --> 00:35:01,789
Correct me if I'm wrong,

710
00:35:01,789 --> 00:35:08,003
my intention should be to have-
to give more life.

711
00:35:08,087 --> 00:35:09,922
Except as a bar.

712
00:35:09,964 --> 00:35:10,923
But Jackie, can I-

713
00:35:10,964 --> 00:35:13,717
my concern is that I'm going
to be over the top.

714
00:35:13,759 --> 00:35:18,513
No, honey, you're so under
the top right now,

715
00:35:18,555 --> 00:35:21,265
it's like you're selling me
a douche.

716
00:35:21,307 --> 00:35:23,476
I'm getting you on the beach
in a floral print dress,

717
00:35:23,518 --> 00:35:25,478
talking about feminine
freshness.

718
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:26,770
Is that the read
you're going for?

719
00:35:26,812 --> 00:35:29,773
No, that's not.
Those were good word pictures.

720
00:35:29,815 --> 00:35:33,110
Just translate them
for what I need...

721
00:35:33,151 --> 00:35:37,989
good, yeah, I can do this.
I'm just gonna keep going.

722
00:35:38,072 --> 00:35:40,992
You are so mean. You're not
even listening to her.

723
00:35:40,992 --> 00:35:43,744
Yes, I am. She thinks she's
doing books on tape.

724
00:35:43,828 --> 00:35:46,080
- I think she's good.
- Don't change the subject.

725
00:35:46,121 --> 00:35:47,289
Bret and I are cooking dinner
on Friday night.

726
00:35:47,331 --> 00:35:49,124
What are you having?

727
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:51,543
Shut up, you're coming.

728
00:35:51,585 --> 00:35:53,003
Is "he" invited?

729
00:35:53,003 --> 00:35:54,921
No, just you.

730
00:35:55,922 --> 00:35:57,423
Pause.

731
00:35:57,465 --> 00:35:59,884
That's it. Go home.

732
00:35:59,926 --> 00:36:02,845
You want me to go?
I should go home?

733
00:36:02,887 --> 00:36:04,305
No, you're incredible.

734
00:36:04,346 --> 00:36:06,682
That voice?
Don't even kid yourself-

735
00:36:06,724 --> 00:36:08,684
you're gonna have
a huge career.

736
00:36:10,102 --> 00:36:13,396
I thought... thank you.
Thanks to you!

737
00:36:28,702 --> 00:36:30,662
Jackie's a piece of work.

738
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:34,290
Bret's a lying sack of shit.

739
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:38,503
You look good.

740
00:36:38,544 --> 00:36:39,504
I have no idea.

741
00:36:39,545 --> 00:36:41,255
If it's a sports figure,
I'll kill you.

742
00:36:41,297 --> 00:36:43,132
- Julia White!
- No, no, no.

743
00:36:43,174 --> 00:36:44,133
Eli Weizel!

744
00:36:44,174 --> 00:36:46,343
You're actually not my partner.
Come on! Go go go!

745
00:36:46,426 --> 00:36:48,011
What makes you think I know?

746
00:36:48,095 --> 00:36:49,930
Come on! All right, pass!

747
00:36:49,971 --> 00:36:52,682
This one... fuck! Open!

748
00:36:52,724 --> 00:36:55,393
The ex-football player
who allegedly killed his wife.

749
00:36:55,435 --> 00:36:58,020
Oh-oh-oh-oh... "allegedly"?
What, are you nuts?

750
00:36:58,062 --> 00:36:59,397
- Just say it!
- O.J. Simpson.

751
00:36:59,438 --> 00:37:01,190
Yes!

752
00:37:01,232 --> 00:37:03,317
It's like saying Jackie
allegedly got a nose job.

753
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,735
Shut up.

754
00:37:04,777 --> 00:37:08,739
Both of you shut up!
The first name rhymes with this.

755
00:37:11,241 --> 00:37:12,867
Could you never,
ever do that again?

756
00:37:12,909 --> 00:37:14,327
Just say it!

757
00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:17,038
Time! Time, time, time.

758
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:18,581
Bret, is it maybe time?

759
00:37:18,664 --> 00:37:20,833
- Who the fuck was that?
- I bet it was one of Brad's.

760
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:22,876
They're so hard,
because he's so smart.

761
00:37:22,918 --> 00:37:25,379
Apparently not smart enough
to know you had a nose job.

762
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,756
- I told you about that.
- No, you didn't.

763
00:37:27,798 --> 00:37:29,633
So what's the diff?

764
00:37:29,674 --> 00:37:31,051
Come on, Bret,
like you couldn't tell?

765
00:37:31,092 --> 00:37:34,679
Every Jewish teen-age girl with
money winds up with that nose.

766
00:37:34,721 --> 00:37:37,181
Don't you think
it's a little bit weird

767
00:37:37,223 --> 00:37:39,183
that everyone on the planet
knows but your boyfriend?

768
00:37:41,268 --> 00:37:43,187
Seriously, Eli, who was that?

769
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:45,063
I was doing the hula, so-

770
00:37:45,105 --> 00:37:47,315
It's a little strange. Right?

771
00:37:48,858 --> 00:37:51,402
They used to call me the jackal.

772
00:37:51,444 --> 00:37:54,155
So I got a nose job.
Are you happy now?

773
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:56,616
I give up, what
rhymes with hula?

774
00:37:56,657 --> 00:37:58,742
Jackal? That's brutal.

775
00:37:58,784 --> 00:38:00,744
You're being a jerk.

776
00:38:00,786 --> 00:38:03,372
But I'm being an honestjerk,
so that counts for something.

777
00:38:04,373 --> 00:38:06,041
Wait, shh! You hear that?

778
00:38:06,082 --> 00:38:08,043
That's the sound of you
not getting laid tonight.

779
00:38:11,129 --> 00:38:12,255
Bret: That's wonderful.

780
00:38:12,296 --> 00:38:13,297
Did you guys hear that?

781
00:38:13,297 --> 00:38:14,674
That was the sound
of Jackie being a bitch.

782
00:38:14,715 --> 00:38:15,675
Did you guys hear that?

783
00:38:15,716 --> 00:38:16,675
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

784
00:38:16,717 --> 00:38:17,718
Jackie: What do you want
from me?

785
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,012
How about a little honesty?

786
00:38:20,054 --> 00:38:23,265
The self-pity bus stops
right in front of my building.

787
00:38:23,307 --> 00:38:24,724
Don't miss it.

788
00:38:24,766 --> 00:38:26,810
Maybe I'll get
on the self-pity bus-

789
00:38:26,893 --> 00:38:28,311
- You do that!
- and maybe I'll get a transfer.

790
00:38:28,353 --> 00:38:31,314
Can we get outta here

791
00:38:31,356 --> 00:38:33,232
before they start
looking like my parents?

792
00:38:33,274 --> 00:38:35,234
- Fine with me.
- Your place?

793
00:38:36,277 --> 00:38:38,487
Yeah, okay-

794
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:40,656
Was that Tallulah Bankhead?

795
00:38:41,698 --> 00:38:44,034
No, Rula Lenska.

796
00:38:44,075 --> 00:38:46,036
Rula Lenska.

797
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:49,539
Who the fuck is Rula Lenska?

798
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:56,712
Guess they made up.

799
00:38:56,754 --> 00:38:58,714
Hope she paid for Scotchgard.

800
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:03,885
Don't do that.
No, not right now.

801
00:39:07,347 --> 00:39:09,974
Eli: Like when people say
"excetera" instead of "et cetera."

802
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:13,144
What is that, "excetera"?
It's crazy.

803
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:16,689
My favorite is
"for all intensive purposes."

804
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:20,359
That's nuts. It's like,
"Where did you go to school?"

805
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,402
Are you sure you don't
want a sandwich?

806
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:24,029
I don't know how you could
eat that food.

807
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,655
No offense, but Jackie
can't cook for shit.

808
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,407
No wonder Brett's
losing weight.

809
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,367
Hollywood News.
Where's your section?

810
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,786
- No, you don't have to.
- Come on.

811
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,829
It's embarrassing.

812
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,707
That's it, right there.

813
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,710
Look at that, "Police Blotter,
edited by Eli Wyckoff."

814
00:39:39,793 --> 00:39:41,086
I don't want you to...

815
00:39:41,127 --> 00:39:45,590
"Juan A. Maas, 35,
arrested early Sunday for DUI.

816
00:39:45,632 --> 00:39:48,509
Blood alcohol level was 2.1

817
00:39:48,551 --> 00:39:51,262
when suspect was
apprehinded' by LAPD."

818
00:39:51,303 --> 00:39:52,263
What?

819
00:39:52,304 --> 00:39:53,931
It says "apprehinded."

820
00:39:53,973 --> 00:39:54,932
No, it doesn't.
It's apprehended.

821
00:39:54,973 --> 00:39:56,350
It says apprehinded.

822
00:39:56,391 --> 00:39:59,394
Oh my God! Shit!

823
00:39:59,394 --> 00:40:00,979
To apprehind,
that's what...

824
00:40:01,021 --> 00:40:03,690
that's when they grab
the guy on the ass?

825
00:40:03,731 --> 00:40:06,484
God damn it, I proofed this
like a million times! God!

826
00:40:06,567 --> 00:40:08,194
Relax.

827
00:40:08,236 --> 00:40:10,446
- Do you know what you need?
- A newjob.

828
00:40:10,529 --> 00:40:12,406
No, you need a drink.

829
00:40:12,448 --> 00:40:14,491
A drink. A real drink.

830
00:40:14,575 --> 00:40:16,326
Do you have any vodka?

831
00:40:16,368 --> 00:40:17,911
I don't know.

832
00:40:17,953 --> 00:40:21,206
Is this vodka?
I've had it since 1947.

833
00:40:21,247 --> 00:40:22,248
Do you have martini glasses?

834
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,042
Those are my martini glasses...

835
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:26,419
and myjuice glasses
and my water glasses.

836
00:40:26,461 --> 00:40:28,087
Never mind, they'll do.

837
00:40:28,129 --> 00:40:31,924
I am going to introduce you to
the wonderful world of martinis.

838
00:40:57,656 --> 00:40:59,074
( phone ringing )

839
00:40:59,115 --> 00:41:00,700
No, screen, screen.

840
00:41:00,742 --> 00:41:02,493
- Let me get it.
- Let the machine get it.

841
00:41:02,535 --> 00:41:03,661
I bet you can't do it.

842
00:41:03,703 --> 00:41:05,746
I can do it.

843
00:41:05,788 --> 00:41:07,748
I dare you.

844
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:10,250
All right.

845
00:41:10,292 --> 00:41:12,377
Hi, this is Eli.
Leave a message.

846
00:41:12,461 --> 00:41:14,171
I gotta get that piece
of shit machine fixed.

847
00:41:14,254 --> 00:41:15,714
Eli, this is Dr. Wyckoff.

848
00:41:15,797 --> 00:41:16,756
There's something wrong
with your machine.

849
00:41:16,798 --> 00:41:18,049
- That's your shrink?
- My mom.

850
00:41:18,091 --> 00:41:19,050
You refer to her-

851
00:41:19,134 --> 00:41:20,593
It took her 1 2 years
to get her Ph.D.

852
00:41:20,635 --> 00:41:22,095
She likes to hear
herself say it.

853
00:41:22,136 --> 00:41:23,513
- Now move.
- No.

854
00:41:23,554 --> 00:41:25,598
Move, I'm serious.
It's not funny.

855
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:27,600
I was just reading the
New England Journal of Medicine

856
00:41:27,641 --> 00:41:29,768
and there's a pullout section
on the new TSE-

857
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:32,771
Testicular Self-Examine. How to
make it part of your lifestyle.

858
00:41:32,813 --> 00:41:35,190
- My God.
- Do you want to try?

859
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,442
No, come on. Goddamn it!

860
00:41:37,484 --> 00:41:39,777
I faxed a diagram
over to your office.

861
00:41:39,819 --> 00:41:40,778
I put your name all over it.

862
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,905
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God.

863
00:41:42,947 --> 00:41:44,281
Don't listen, don't listen.

864
00:41:44,323 --> 00:41:47,076
...the hues just hit you
right in the face.

865
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:49,620
You may want to give yourself
an exam while I read aloud.

866
00:41:49,703 --> 00:41:51,079
I think we should
do this exam together.

867
00:41:51,121 --> 00:41:53,081
Let's take a deep breath
together.

868
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,710
Start by lifting the penis
to one side.

869
00:41:57,752 --> 00:41:59,295
Oh my God!

870
00:41:59,337 --> 00:42:03,132
Slowly roll the testicle
between the thumb and fingers,

871
00:42:03,174 --> 00:42:05,593
applying slight pressure.

872
00:42:07,302 --> 00:42:09,137
Hello, Mom, it's me.

873
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,139
Mom: Who?

874
00:42:11,181 --> 00:42:15,060
- Eli?
- Eli, are we screening?

875
00:42:15,101 --> 00:42:17,895
Yeah-no, I wasn't actually.
We just got in.

876
00:42:17,937 --> 00:42:19,272
Mom: "We"?

877
00:42:19,355 --> 00:42:20,857
What does that mean?

878
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,317
Eli: Can I call you back?
Mom: Do we have company?

879
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,318
Yes.

880
00:42:25,444 --> 00:42:26,403
Mom: Jewish?

881
00:42:26,445 --> 00:42:27,404
No, but...

882
00:42:27,446 --> 00:42:28,405
Cute?

883
00:42:28,447 --> 00:42:29,990
Eli: Will you stop?
Mom: Wear a condom.

884
00:42:30,032 --> 00:42:32,033
Oh, God, Mom, no,
it's not like that.

885
00:42:32,075 --> 00:42:33,410
Mom: You hear
about the TSE?

886
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:36,037
Did you hear
what I was talking about?

887
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,997
Yeah, we both did. Thanks.

888
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:39,916
Maybe you both could
do it together then,

889
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:43,043
nothing wrong with helping each
other with a testicular exam.

890
00:42:43,085 --> 00:42:44,837
- Mom.
- Don't be shy.

891
00:42:44,878 --> 00:42:46,296
I got to call you later, okay?

892
00:42:46,338 --> 00:42:48,465
Wait a second, honey.
Call me tomorrow morning-

893
00:42:48,507 --> 00:42:49,674
Goodbye.

894
00:42:53,553 --> 00:42:55,013
I feel so dirty.

895
00:42:55,096 --> 00:42:57,223
So, why does it matter
if I'm Jewish?

896
00:42:58,724 --> 00:43:00,017
You heard that?

897
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:01,185
Oh, yeah.

898
00:43:01,227 --> 00:43:02,228
Oh, my God.

899
00:43:02,228 --> 00:43:03,229
I'll be in the bathroom,

900
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:06,523
hoping to God that I can
overdose on Tums or Maalox

901
00:43:06,565 --> 00:43:09,317
or pine scented Glade.
I'm so embarrassed.

902
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,194
Don't be.
It wasn't that bad.

903
00:43:11,236 --> 00:43:12,237
Eli: Really?

904
00:43:12,237 --> 00:43:14,280
It was funny, actually.

905
00:43:14,322 --> 00:43:15,323
Call Mom for me.

906
00:43:15,365 --> 00:43:16,365
I can not talk to her.

907
00:43:16,407 --> 00:43:18,159
The woman stopped having
boundaries

908
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,618
when she stopped
wearing a bra.

909
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,871
And the fact
that I know that-

910
00:43:21,912 --> 00:43:23,872
I know, it's scary.

911
00:43:23,914 --> 00:43:25,666
Does she pull that shit
with you?

912
00:43:25,707 --> 00:43:26,792
Are you kidding?

913
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:28,418
She wanted me
to tape my first time

914
00:43:28,502 --> 00:43:29,586
for her evaluation.

915
00:43:29,669 --> 00:43:30,795
Eli: And?

916
00:43:30,879 --> 00:43:32,297
I'm not telling you.

917
00:43:33,673 --> 00:43:35,591
Did I tell you she sent me
this article

918
00:43:35,633 --> 00:43:38,302
about circle jerks
and the new safe sex?

919
00:43:38,344 --> 00:43:40,095
Can you believe
I thought circle jerks

920
00:43:40,137 --> 00:43:41,805
was a figure skating term?

921
00:43:41,847 --> 00:43:43,474
It is among
the male figure skaters.

922
00:43:45,142 --> 00:43:47,060
Will you please
call her for me, please?

923
00:43:47,102 --> 00:43:48,061
I can't talk to her.

924
00:43:48,103 --> 00:43:49,604
You can't fight it.

925
00:43:49,646 --> 00:43:52,023
The more you avoid her,
the more she's going

926
00:43:52,065 --> 00:43:54,776
to insist on meeting- what's
your boyfriend's name?

927
00:43:54,817 --> 00:43:56,569
Tom, and he's not my boyfriend.

928
00:43:56,611 --> 00:43:57,570
Whatever.

929
00:43:57,611 --> 00:43:58,863
I don't know
what he is.

930
00:43:58,904 --> 00:44:00,155
What do you want him to be?

931
00:44:04,368 --> 00:44:05,327
It's like...

932
00:44:06,786 --> 00:44:09,039
I just wish I knew,

933
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,498
one way or the other.

934
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:14,085
Okay, put the bong down,
space cowboy.

935
00:44:14,126 --> 00:44:16,670
He's your fucking boyfriend,
just like I said.

936
00:44:26,471 --> 00:44:27,764
Tom: Eli!

937
00:44:29,182 --> 00:44:31,142
( music playing )

938
00:44:32,477 --> 00:44:36,647
- When you said to me -

939
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:40,484
- You are not so old -

940
00:44:40,526 --> 00:44:44,112
- Did I know it then? -

941
00:44:44,154 --> 00:44:46,614
- 'Cause I've just been told -

942
00:44:46,656 --> 00:44:49,492
- I didn't think I'd find you -

943
00:44:49,534 --> 00:44:53,329
- Perfect in so many ways -

944
00:44:53,371 --> 00:44:55,331
- But I've been waiting... -

945
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,042
What's with you
and nudity?

946
00:44:58,083 --> 00:45:00,586
Nothing,
but that movie was pandering.

947
00:45:00,627 --> 00:45:02,004
It was an art film.

948
00:45:02,045 --> 00:45:03,964
Yeah, the art of guys
with six-pack abs

949
00:45:04,005 --> 00:45:05,882
blowing each other
every chance they get.

950
00:45:05,965 --> 00:45:07,717
Every gay guy in LA
is "run don't walk."

951
00:45:09,052 --> 00:45:10,303
The problem with that is...?

952
00:45:11,762 --> 00:45:13,389
You might as well
stay home and watch

953
00:45:13,431 --> 00:45:15,057
"The Hand that Rocks My Ladle."

954
00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:16,267
Or "Pocahoncho."

955
00:45:16,308 --> 00:45:18,102
At least those movies
don't pretend to be

956
00:45:18,143 --> 00:45:19,102
what they're not.

957
00:45:19,144 --> 00:45:21,104
You have those?
Pop them in.

958
00:45:21,188 --> 00:45:22,772
Oh, God!
You're part of the problem.

959
00:45:22,814 --> 00:45:24,107
Let me get this straight,

960
00:45:24,149 --> 00:45:28,152
you think a movie about two guys
can't be about love, just sex?

961
00:45:28,194 --> 00:45:30,363
Those guys were in love.

962
00:45:30,404 --> 00:45:32,281
But it was
a special kind of love,

963
00:45:32,323 --> 00:45:34,158
The kind of love
that required latex.

964
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,993
Oh my God.
Never mind.

965
00:45:36,035 --> 00:45:37,828
I can't argue
with a guy who never saw

966
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:40,455
"Gone with the Wind."
What is that?

967
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:42,707
God, would you relax?

968
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:44,000
You're gonna have
an aneurysm.

969
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:45,460
You are infuriating.

970
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:50,548
You don't have to-

971
00:45:50,589 --> 00:45:52,508
Do you want me to stop?

972
00:45:54,259 --> 00:45:55,219
No.

973
00:45:59,973 --> 00:46:01,349
You always smell so good.

974
00:46:05,478 --> 00:46:06,813
Okay, there you go.

975
00:46:08,189 --> 00:46:10,858
So Saturday is tennis, right?

976
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:15,445
Must be an open from Australia,
British, Pakistani, right?

977
00:46:15,529 --> 00:46:17,239
Is something wrong?

978
00:46:18,865 --> 00:46:21,034
No, I just want
to watch TV.

979
00:46:24,787 --> 00:46:25,997
That's okay,
I get it.

980
00:46:28,332 --> 00:46:29,291
Get what?

981
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:30,626
Same as usual.

982
00:46:30,668 --> 00:46:32,461
The whole
come-here-go-away routine.

983
00:46:33,212 --> 00:46:35,214
Do you want me
to keep massaging you? I will.

984
00:46:35,255 --> 00:46:36,256
But I tell you,

985
00:46:36,256 --> 00:46:38,175
this isn't the way
to get me to want to.

986
00:46:38,216 --> 00:46:39,759
Tom, it's actually fine.

987
00:46:42,137 --> 00:46:43,846
You're not attracted to me,

988
00:46:43,888 --> 00:46:46,057
you want to be just friends,
I can handle that.

989
00:46:46,098 --> 00:46:47,933
But then stop
fucking calling me,

990
00:46:48,017 --> 00:46:50,561
inviting me to see semi-porn
on a Saturday afternoon,

991
00:46:50,644 --> 00:46:53,730
then drive me back to my house,
and start rubbing my shoulders

992
00:46:53,814 --> 00:46:55,065
and expect me to be like,

993
00:46:55,107 --> 00:46:57,359
"Hey, buddy, thanks a lot,
I'll see you around."

994
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,320
What is so wrong with
taking things slow?

995
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:02,655
Why does it always have to be
all or nothing with you?

996
00:47:02,697 --> 00:47:03,656
I don't know.

997
00:47:05,449 --> 00:47:07,993
All right, then maybe we should
cool it offfor a while.

998
00:47:08,035 --> 00:47:10,162
No, I like you, I do.

999
00:47:10,204 --> 00:47:11,163
Thank you.

1000
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:15,917
I want to have a good time.

1001
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:20,213
I don't want this intense thing.

1002
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:21,839
And you seem to want this...

1003
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,926
I don't know,
what do you want?

1004
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:30,848
Eggs, actually.

1005
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,309
Whatever.

1006
00:47:42,191 --> 00:47:43,943
Remember cooties?

1007
00:47:43,985 --> 00:47:46,195
Don't touch the losers
or you get cooties?

1008
00:47:46,237 --> 00:47:47,821
And who were the losers?

1009
00:47:47,863 --> 00:47:48,947
Easy.

1010
00:47:48,989 --> 00:47:51,658
Anybody with a hard-boiled egg
in their lunch bag.

1011
00:47:54,161 --> 00:47:56,413
I don't think Tom liked
what I had in my lunch bag.

1012
00:48:02,001 --> 00:48:04,003
Eli, let it out.

1013
00:48:05,504 --> 00:48:07,172
No, I don't want
to talk about it.

1014
00:48:07,214 --> 00:48:08,173
Cop out!

1015
00:48:08,215 --> 00:48:10,425
Why do you feel the need
to beat yourself up?

1016
00:48:10,467 --> 00:48:12,469
Why won't you
let us into the now?

1017
00:48:12,511 --> 00:48:15,263
Why do I feel like I'm in
a cheesy 70s EST seminar?

1018
00:48:15,305 --> 00:48:17,140
Good, how else do you feel?

1019
00:48:17,182 --> 00:48:19,976
Would you like us
to bring out the feel wheel?

1020
00:48:20,017 --> 00:48:21,310
I would actually like it

1021
00:48:21,352 --> 00:48:23,646
if you would just leave me alone
for a little while.

1022
00:48:32,821 --> 00:48:35,573
Let me in.
I'm not going to hurt you,

1023
00:48:35,615 --> 00:48:37,825
I'm your friend.
What is wrong?

1024
00:48:37,867 --> 00:48:39,452
I'm fine, okay?

1025
00:48:39,494 --> 00:48:40,786
I don't think so.

1026
00:48:44,248 --> 00:48:45,207
It's this guy.

1027
00:48:45,249 --> 00:48:46,250
I knew it.

1028
00:48:47,459 --> 00:48:49,878
He has this reputation
for being sort of easy.

1029
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,879
Mm-hmm.

1030
00:48:51,922 --> 00:48:53,506
Not with me.

1031
00:48:53,548 --> 00:48:55,592
With me, it's hard.

1032
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:57,760
Or not hard,
maybe that's the problem.

1033
00:49:04,892 --> 00:49:06,643
Oh, Eli, what is this?

1034
00:49:12,065 --> 00:49:13,358
I hate this movie.

1035
00:49:13,399 --> 00:49:14,442
David, come in here.

1036
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:16,486
You won't believe
what they're showing again.

1037
00:49:16,569 --> 00:49:18,487
What a piece of shit film,
honestly.

1038
00:49:18,529 --> 00:49:21,740
- We're supposed to believe-
- They showed it last week.

1039
00:49:21,782 --> 00:49:23,575
that this woman is
going to fall in love with

1040
00:49:23,617 --> 00:49:25,869
a middle-aged homophobic
self-hating teacher

1041
00:49:25,911 --> 00:49:27,579
who's only now discovered
he's gay.

1042
00:49:27,621 --> 00:49:29,623
- We hated this movie.
- I don't think so!

1043
00:49:29,664 --> 00:49:30,957
Both: Change the channel!

1044
00:49:30,999 --> 00:49:31,958
Fuck you!

1045
00:49:45,721 --> 00:49:47,139
Hi.

1046
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,139
Hi, Sunny.

1047
00:49:51,935 --> 00:49:54,604
Oh, honey,
that's so sweet.

1048
00:49:56,772 --> 00:49:59,275
Right now the thought offood
makes me want to borscht.

1049
00:50:00,317 --> 00:50:02,486
Pretty picture
to wake up to, huh?

1050
00:50:02,528 --> 00:50:06,907
Well, A, I can't imagine
waking up to any other picture.

1051
00:50:06,948 --> 00:50:08,491
And B...

1052
00:50:09,951 --> 00:50:12,203
I don't ever want to have to.

1053
00:50:12,245 --> 00:50:13,955
What is this?

1054
00:50:13,996 --> 00:50:16,540
Those are capers.
I made them on the side.

1055
00:50:19,168 --> 00:50:20,169
Oh, my God!

1056
00:50:22,296 --> 00:50:23,297
Oh, my God!

1057
00:50:26,132 --> 00:50:27,133
Oh, shit!

1058
00:50:28,009 --> 00:50:29,427
Do you...

1059
00:50:29,469 --> 00:50:31,763
Oh no, no, no.

1060
00:50:31,804 --> 00:50:33,431
Of course I'll marry you.

1061
00:50:35,433 --> 00:50:37,393
It's just now everybody's
going to think

1062
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:39,019
we're doing it
because I'm pregnant.

1063
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:49,320
Oh, my God!

1064
00:50:50,697 --> 00:50:51,989
Oh, my God!

1065
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:57,119
Mr. Preggers!
Wake up, Mr. Preggers!

1066
00:50:59,788 --> 00:51:02,249
We should never
have fooled around.

1067
00:51:02,332 --> 00:51:04,584
I know, why don't you
have some more wine?

1068
00:51:04,626 --> 00:51:05,627
What can I say?

1069
00:51:05,669 --> 00:51:07,754
He doesn't make me
weak in the knees.

1070
00:51:07,795 --> 00:51:10,548
Please, that is exactly
why you should be with him.

1071
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:13,092
The ones that make you dizzy
are only good for a quick fuck.

1072
00:51:13,175 --> 00:51:14,802
The rest are
marriage material.

1073
00:51:15,886 --> 00:51:17,513
Like Bret.

1074
00:51:17,596 --> 00:51:20,307
That is exactly
what I'm afraid of.

1075
00:51:23,268 --> 00:51:24,185
Wait what?

1076
00:51:26,855 --> 00:51:28,523
Wow!

1077
00:51:28,564 --> 00:51:29,816
Wow, that was fast!

1078
00:51:29,857 --> 00:51:31,609
Well, tick-tock, you know?

1079
00:51:33,778 --> 00:51:35,279
You're crazy!

1080
00:51:35,321 --> 00:51:36,864
I want you to be
my man of honor.

1081
00:51:36,905 --> 00:51:38,323
There's no such thing.

1082
00:51:38,365 --> 00:51:39,658
So. You're my best friend.

1083
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,493
I can't imagine
anybody else by my side.

1084
00:51:42,827 --> 00:51:45,121
And your first duty,
as my personal slave,

1085
00:51:45,163 --> 00:51:46,497
is to pretend to love it.

1086
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:50,710
Fine, fine.

1087
00:51:52,878 --> 00:51:55,089
Jackie: Thanks. I love you.

1088
00:52:10,394 --> 00:52:12,021
It's Jackie...

1089
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:13,522
again.

1090
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:15,190
Hello?

1091
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:17,025
Jackie: Where are you?

1092
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:19,194
Call me back, stat.

1093
00:52:35,876 --> 00:52:40,588
Message: Hi, this is Tom.
Leave a message, or don't.

1094
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:43,049
- ( beep )
- This is the bride-to-be.

1095
00:52:43,091 --> 00:52:44,676
I really wouldn't mind

1096
00:52:44,717 --> 00:52:46,677
having my best friend
around right now,

1097
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:49,388
being that it's the most
important time of my life.

1098
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,142
But hey, maybe

1099
00:52:53,183 --> 00:52:54,810
that's too much to ask for.

1100
00:52:54,893 --> 00:52:59,814
- Just to see your face again -

1101
00:52:59,898 --> 00:53:02,358
- Just to make you smile -

1102
00:53:03,943 --> 00:53:06,237
- Would set me free -

1103
00:53:08,447 --> 00:53:13,368
- If I could bring you back -

1104
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:17,080
- That would be
the sweetest thing -

1105
00:53:17,122 --> 00:53:20,166
- If I could bring you back -

1106
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,838
- To me. -

1107
00:54:41,574 --> 00:54:42,533
Freeze!

1108
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,835
Jack, Jack, pick up, it's me.

1109
00:55:41,462 --> 00:55:43,422
Jackie, please pick up.

1110
00:55:45,007 --> 00:55:48,176
I met someone...

1111
00:55:48,218 --> 00:55:49,177
apparently.

1112
00:55:49,261 --> 00:55:51,179
Fuck!

1113
00:55:55,349 --> 00:55:57,310
Listen, Jack,

1114
00:55:58,894 --> 00:56:03,190
I'm really sorry I haven't
returned your calls.

1115
00:56:03,232 --> 00:56:05,901
I've been a shit, and...

1116
00:56:05,942 --> 00:56:08,236
it's me, it's not you.

1117
00:56:09,946 --> 00:56:11,948
Like you don't know that.

1118
00:56:18,496 --> 00:56:20,456
Jack, I really need
to talk to you.

1119
00:56:20,497 --> 00:56:23,292
I'm freaking out here.

1120
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:23,959
Jesus.

1121
00:56:24,001 --> 00:56:27,462
This guy has the number eight
tattooed on his-

1122
00:56:27,504 --> 00:56:30,423
Wait.

1123
00:56:30,465 --> 00:56:33,384
Correction, it says
"Eighth Wonder."

1124
00:56:33,426 --> 00:56:36,929
I really know how to pick them.
Jack, please call me back.

1125
00:56:43,727 --> 00:56:47,480
Open your eyes
and look at me.

1126
00:56:47,564 --> 00:56:49,649
No, I don't think
I will kiss you.

1127
00:56:49,732 --> 00:56:51,734
Although you need
kissing badly...

1128
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:01,576
...if the right moment
ever came.

1129
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:04,579
You're a conceited black-hearted
varmint, Rhett Butler.

1130
00:57:04,663 --> 00:57:06,456
I don't know why
I let you come see me.

1131
00:57:06,498 --> 00:57:10,877
I'll tell you why, Scarlett.
The war can't last much longer.

1132
00:57:10,918 --> 00:57:13,004
Really, Rhett? Why?

1133
00:57:13,045 --> 00:57:15,172
There's a little battle
going on right now...

1134
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:18,926
( phone ringing )

1135
00:57:21,219 --> 00:57:22,679
Hello?

1136
00:57:22,762 --> 00:57:24,097
How've you been?

1137
00:57:30,853 --> 00:57:33,397
- Okay.
- Good.

1138
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:35,399
Listen...

1139
00:57:38,986 --> 00:57:40,487
What?

1140
00:57:40,529 --> 00:57:41,822
What I was going to say was

1141
00:57:41,863 --> 00:57:45,075
I've been procrastinating
about this whole wedding thing.

1142
00:57:45,116 --> 00:57:48,286
I haven't gotten a gift
for Jackie's shower yet.

1143
00:57:49,328 --> 00:57:50,580
I guess I'm in denial.

1144
00:57:50,621 --> 00:57:52,581
I'm sure it's not
the first time.

1145
00:57:53,874 --> 00:57:56,627
Right.

1146
00:57:56,710 --> 00:58:01,006
Tom, I never got the email
that our cooling off period

1147
00:58:01,047 --> 00:58:02,799
was officially over.

1148
00:58:02,841 --> 00:58:06,177
And frankly, I'd like
to renew my option.

1149
00:58:06,219 --> 00:58:08,304
- Ummm...
- 'Bye.

1150
00:58:12,391 --> 00:58:14,685
- ( phone ringing )
- Fuck, fuck, fuck...

1151
00:58:14,727 --> 00:58:18,355
Hi, this is Eli.
Leave a message.

1152
00:58:18,397 --> 00:58:19,564
It's Tom again. Listen...

1153
00:58:19,606 --> 00:58:22,525
Now he's fucking with me.
That's great.

1154
00:58:22,567 --> 00:58:25,028
...mean we can't buy
a baby gift together.

1155
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:27,029
- I hate people like this.
- I know.

1156
00:58:27,113 --> 00:58:29,699
They play this game.
Once you decide to play too,

1157
00:58:29,782 --> 00:58:31,909
they don't want to play anymore.
What the fuck is that?

1158
00:58:31,992 --> 00:58:34,203
I'm starting to think that's
all there is out there anymore.

1159
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:35,204
That's wrong.

1160
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:39,332
No, here's what I think.
I think who I am, what I've been-

1161
00:58:39,374 --> 00:58:40,959
is not working so much anymore.

1162
00:58:41,001 --> 00:58:43,253
From now on there's going
to be a whole new Eli.

1163
00:58:43,294 --> 00:58:45,129
The whole love thing,
I don't buy it.

1164
00:58:45,171 --> 00:58:46,506
How come it works for me?

1165
00:58:46,547 --> 00:58:48,883
You're so full of shit.
It doesn't work for you.

1166
00:58:48,924 --> 00:58:50,509
You fall in love with
a different person each week.

1167
00:58:50,551 --> 00:58:51,302
My point exactly.

1168
00:58:51,343 --> 00:58:54,846
No, you fall in love
with the idea of being in love.

1169
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:56,681
With a married man. To what?

1170
00:58:56,723 --> 00:58:58,600
So you can experience the rush
of breaking up a family?

1171
00:58:58,642 --> 00:59:01,186
Now you fall in love with a deaf
guy to learn sign language?

1172
00:59:01,269 --> 00:59:02,562
Well, I did.

1173
00:59:02,604 --> 00:59:04,689
Honey, this does not
constitute sign language.

1174
00:59:04,772 --> 00:59:07,441
And then with a woman,
just to piss off Mom and Dad.

1175
00:59:07,483 --> 00:59:09,485
How much did that backfire?

1176
00:59:09,568 --> 00:59:12,237
That's the year they decided
to run for co-president of p-flag.

1177
00:59:12,279 --> 00:59:15,907
You know what? From now it's
going to be one night stands,

1178
00:59:15,949 --> 00:59:18,243
casual sex, just a lot
of close friends.

1179
00:59:18,285 --> 00:59:19,953
You sound pathetic.

1180
00:59:19,994 --> 00:59:21,746
No, for the first time
in my life,

1181
00:59:21,788 --> 00:59:23,623
I think I actually make sense.

1182
00:59:23,664 --> 00:59:25,958
Great, glad to help you through
the pain. 'Bye-bye.

1183
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,835
'Bye. I'll call you later.

1184
00:59:27,877 --> 00:59:31,797
Will you tell that other Eli to
give me a call? This one sucks.

1185
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:33,006
( phone ringing )

1186
00:59:33,048 --> 00:59:36,218
It's that's him,
you're not going shopping.

1187
00:59:38,636 --> 00:59:41,014
FYI, the only reason I'm here

1188
00:59:41,055 --> 00:59:43,307
is because your whole
"tires got slashed" story

1189
00:59:43,349 --> 00:59:45,142
was so much more believable

1190
00:59:45,184 --> 00:59:47,102
than the first 1 3 messages
you left me.

1191
00:59:47,144 --> 00:59:50,105
I thought I had you with
the tickets to X-Files on Ice.

1192
00:59:51,148 --> 00:59:53,150
I already saw it.

1193
00:59:57,862 --> 01:00:00,239
I always wanted one
when I was a kid.

1194
01:00:00,281 --> 01:00:02,366
Surprising, huh?

1195
01:00:02,408 --> 01:00:04,118
Oh my God,
I had so many dolls.

1196
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,619
My dad would've killed me.

1197
01:00:05,661 --> 01:00:06,954
- Really?
- Yeah.

1198
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:08,497
My house was like
a free-for-all.

1199
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:10,082
My sister had all these
Barbies and Kens,

1200
01:00:10,165 --> 01:00:12,542
and my parents made me
play with them.

1201
01:00:12,584 --> 01:00:14,377
Your parents forced you
to play with dolls?

1202
01:00:14,419 --> 01:00:16,755
It was just so I could learn
the names of all the body parts.

1203
01:00:18,006 --> 01:00:20,007
Pick whichever doll you like.

1204
01:00:20,007 --> 01:00:24,136
It's your choice.
They're all beautiful.

1205
01:00:24,178 --> 01:00:26,430
Good. Now switch.

1206
01:00:32,227 --> 01:00:34,229
What do you call this?

1207
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:35,730
Vagina!

1208
01:00:35,772 --> 01:00:39,567
Yes, vagina.
Good, Rayna. Eli?

1209
01:00:40,651 --> 01:00:41,986
Vagina.

1210
01:00:42,028 --> 01:00:43,696
Vagina.

1211
01:00:43,779 --> 01:00:45,781
Now say it like you mean it.

1212
01:00:45,864 --> 01:00:47,491
Va-gi-na.

1213
01:00:47,533 --> 01:00:48,992
Vagina.

1214
01:00:49,034 --> 01:00:50,994
Yes, yes.

1215
01:00:52,162 --> 01:00:55,290
I always thought Ken was gay.

1216
01:00:55,331 --> 01:00:57,208
He was when I got through
with him.

1217
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:59,669
That's another story.

1218
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:03,964
You and Ken together
is strangely erotic.

1219
01:01:07,718 --> 01:01:10,971
We have been known to do private
shows, if you're interested.

1220
01:01:12,389 --> 01:01:14,349
Not today.

1221
01:01:15,475 --> 01:01:17,435
O-kay.

1222
01:01:19,478 --> 01:01:23,357
Hello there, Eli.
I'm Fuzzy Wuzzy the bear.

1223
01:01:29,738 --> 01:01:31,698
Jackie would love this bear.

1224
01:01:33,783 --> 01:01:37,370
Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear,
Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair

1225
01:01:37,411 --> 01:01:40,331
Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't
very fuzzy, was he?

1226
01:01:40,372 --> 01:01:42,916
Was he? Was he? Was he...

1227
01:01:42,958 --> 01:01:44,293
- was he, was he-
- Wuzzy.

1228
01:01:44,334 --> 01:01:46,545
Wuzzy! Wuzzy!

1229
01:01:48,255 --> 01:01:49,381
That's what I said.

1230
01:01:49,464 --> 01:01:52,800
No, you said, "was he."
It's Wuzzy.

1231
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:54,594
What's the difference?

1232
01:01:54,635 --> 01:01:56,095
You're kidding, right?

1233
01:01:56,137 --> 01:01:59,515
You just establish that
Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair.

1234
01:01:59,557 --> 01:02:01,141
Why would you
then ask "was he"?

1235
01:02:01,183 --> 01:02:04,061
Like a question, like you didn't
know if he was fuzzy or not.

1236
01:02:04,102 --> 01:02:07,314
It is a question. I am asking
if Fuzzy is or isn't fuzzy.

1237
01:02:07,355 --> 01:02:08,356
What is so wrong about that?

1238
01:02:08,398 --> 01:02:10,859
It is a rhetorical question.
There is no answer to it.

1239
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:11,901
It's supposed to be ironic.

1240
01:02:11,943 --> 01:02:14,946
Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't
very fuzzy... wuzzy?

1241
01:02:29,501 --> 01:02:31,044
I don't think it's that obvious

1242
01:02:31,085 --> 01:02:32,420
that Fuzzy Wuzzy was
or wasn't fuzzy.

1243
01:02:32,462 --> 01:02:35,089
It is the point
of the whole goddamn thing.

1244
01:02:35,131 --> 01:02:36,424
Why are you so uptight?

1245
01:02:36,465 --> 01:02:37,424
I'm not.

1246
01:02:37,466 --> 01:02:38,968
There always has to be
a right way with you

1247
01:02:39,009 --> 01:02:41,053
and a wrong way with you.

1248
01:02:41,095 --> 01:02:43,597
Is that why you like
being with me?

1249
01:02:43,638 --> 01:02:46,224
So you can feel like
you're right all the time?

1250
01:02:46,266 --> 01:02:48,351
What? No.

1251
01:02:48,393 --> 01:02:50,520
Is that what you think?

1252
01:02:50,561 --> 01:02:55,107
Alls I know is you have
this rigid idea of how I should be.

1253
01:02:56,817 --> 01:02:58,235
"Alls you know"?

1254
01:02:58,277 --> 01:03:00,237
All right, I can't.

1255
01:03:03,532 --> 01:03:05,283
Fuck!

1256
01:03:05,325 --> 01:03:07,285
This is mine mine mine!

1257
01:03:08,828 --> 01:03:10,496
I love this.

1258
01:03:10,538 --> 01:03:12,832
Enjoy it now,
because in a month or so,

1259
01:03:12,873 --> 01:03:14,917
you're going to be
ripping at the seams.

1260
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,711
( woman laughing )

1261
01:03:17,753 --> 01:03:18,462
I'm gonna kill you.

1262
01:03:18,504 --> 01:03:21,131
Rachel, could you shut
the fuck up?

1263
01:03:21,173 --> 01:03:23,300
You're cackling like an idiot.

1264
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:26,302
Liz, grab some bows and help us
with the rehearsal bouquet.

1265
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:28,680
Why do you want me to do it?

1266
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:31,182
'Cause you think it's the only
time I'll get to hold one?

1267
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:33,976
Liz, what time is therapy, hon'?
Do they make house calls?

1268
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:35,019
That's really sweet.

1269
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:36,645
Very supportive.
I'm taking my gift back.

1270
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:37,896
I'll make it, I'll make it.

1271
01:03:37,938 --> 01:03:39,731
- Thank you, nice person.
- Thank you, Tom.

1272
01:03:39,773 --> 01:03:40,732
( knocking )

1273
01:03:40,774 --> 01:03:43,151
Wait, the door!
Get the door!

1274
01:03:47,655 --> 01:03:49,407
Is Jackie here?

1275
01:03:49,449 --> 01:03:52,451
Woman: Jackie, did you forget
to pay some parking tickets?

1276
01:03:55,037 --> 01:03:57,080
- Are you Jackie Gold?
- I'll be Jackie Gold!

1277
01:03:57,122 --> 01:03:58,999
Jackie: I'm gonna
kill you guys.

1278
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:00,542
I can't believe you did this.

1279
01:04:00,625 --> 01:04:04,462
Jackie, you have been a bad,
bad, bad girl, haven't you?

1280
01:04:04,504 --> 01:04:06,464
- Oh baby!
- ( dance music playing )

1281
01:04:09,175 --> 01:04:11,093
Put that thing away.

1282
01:04:25,315 --> 01:04:27,525
Jackie: You work that booty!

1283
01:04:32,571 --> 01:04:34,573
This is it!

1284
01:04:35,741 --> 01:04:37,951
That is going to be amazing.

1285
01:04:38,034 --> 01:04:39,202
Enough with the pictures.

1286
01:04:39,286 --> 01:04:41,454
No, it's great!
Just one more!

1287
01:04:43,373 --> 01:04:44,374
- Ring!
- Okay.

1288
01:04:44,415 --> 01:04:46,667
Forget about it, can we talk
about our friend the cop?

1289
01:04:46,709 --> 01:04:48,836
Rachel: You mean your future
ex-husband?

1290
01:04:48,878 --> 01:04:51,046
Tom: So how long have you
been doing this?

1291
01:04:51,088 --> 01:04:53,048
- Too long.
- Yeah?

1292
01:04:58,762 --> 01:04:59,638
Woman #1 : Let me ask you this...

1293
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:01,681
how many of these gifts
can I take home with me?

1294
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:02,807
Woman #2: You're crazy.

1295
01:05:02,849 --> 01:05:05,059
Woman #1 : I wrap beautifully,
though.

1296
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:07,895
Woman #2: Don't you think we
should share?

1297
01:05:07,978 --> 01:05:09,980
You don't even like mine.
Can I take it back?

1298
01:05:10,064 --> 01:05:12,149
Excuse me one second.

1299
01:05:13,859 --> 01:05:16,778
So, you know, I've been
kind of bad myself.

1300
01:05:16,862 --> 01:05:17,821
You have?

1301
01:05:17,862 --> 01:05:19,823
( tires screeching )

1302
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:40,300
- Please forgive me
if I act a little strange -

1303
01:05:42,468 --> 01:05:45,554
- For I know not what I do... -

1304
01:05:46,931 --> 01:05:48,849
( doorbell ringing )

1305
01:05:48,891 --> 01:05:53,979
- Feels like lightning running
through my veins -

1306
01:05:56,398 --> 01:06:00,276
- Every time I look at you... -

1307
01:06:03,988 --> 01:06:04,947
Hey.

1308
01:06:04,989 --> 01:06:07,074
Hey.

1309
01:06:07,116 --> 01:06:08,575
How much do I owe you?

1310
01:06:08,617 --> 01:06:11,036
$9.22.

1311
01:06:11,078 --> 01:06:12,996
Why don't you keep that?

1312
01:06:13,038 --> 01:06:14,831
- Thanks a lot.
- Have a good night.

1313
01:06:14,915 --> 01:06:16,708
You too. Thanks.

1314
01:06:16,791 --> 01:06:20,253
- And there's so much
I want to say -

1315
01:06:24,048 --> 01:06:28,510
Wanna tell you
just how good it feels... -

1316
01:06:33,014 --> 01:06:35,016
- Hey.
- Hi.

1317
01:06:39,353 --> 01:06:41,147
Where did you find this?

1318
01:06:42,189 --> 01:06:43,482
Internet.

1319
01:06:46,694 --> 01:06:48,695
Thank you.

1320
01:06:50,155 --> 01:06:52,824
I took it out of the box
so you could play with it.

1321
01:06:52,866 --> 01:06:54,576
It came in a box?

1322
01:06:54,617 --> 01:06:55,994
- The original box?
- Mm-hmm.

1323
01:06:56,035 --> 01:06:56,995
Where is it?

1324
01:06:57,036 --> 01:06:59,038
I tossed it. Why?

1325
01:07:01,457 --> 01:07:02,625
Why?

1326
01:07:04,627 --> 01:07:05,878
Never mind.

1327
01:07:14,385 --> 01:07:16,804
Tom: And then it happened.

1328
01:07:16,846 --> 01:07:18,806
What?

1329
01:07:19,849 --> 01:07:23,519
We went where no two men should
ever go without a prescription.

1330
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,646
Trust me, you don't want
the details.

1331
01:07:25,729 --> 01:07:27,439
Are you nuts?

1332
01:07:27,481 --> 01:07:29,900
At my age, the details
are all I got.

1333
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:33,653
Take off your...

1334
01:07:33,695 --> 01:07:34,696
Ouch!

1335
01:07:35,822 --> 01:07:37,782
Sorry.

1336
01:07:39,742 --> 01:07:41,702
- Let's not...
- What?

1337
01:07:42,745 --> 01:07:45,164
- Let go of my leg.
- Sorry, sorry.

1338
01:07:45,205 --> 01:07:47,165
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1339
01:07:50,669 --> 01:07:52,629
Wait.

1340
01:07:54,255 --> 01:07:55,214
Don't you want to?

1341
01:07:55,256 --> 01:07:56,799
Do you have a thingy?

1342
01:07:56,883 --> 01:07:58,926
Shut up.

1343
01:07:59,009 --> 01:08:01,095
You know what I mean.
You know what I mean?

1344
01:08:01,178 --> 01:08:03,138
Yeah, yeah.

1345
01:08:11,646 --> 01:08:13,356
- Tom?
- Yeah?

1346
01:08:13,398 --> 01:08:14,482
Look at me.

1347
01:08:14,524 --> 01:08:17,443
I... love you.

1348
01:08:17,485 --> 01:08:18,069
Oh my God.

1349
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:20,487
I love you.

1350
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:22,489
Oh my God!

1351
01:08:47,554 --> 01:08:50,056
I'm hungry.

1352
01:08:50,139 --> 01:08:51,432
Yeah?

1353
01:08:51,474 --> 01:08:53,768
You like eggs? Why don't
I make some eggs?

1354
01:08:56,145 --> 01:08:59,940
I'm supposed to meet my parents
at the country club for brunch.

1355
01:08:59,982 --> 01:09:01,900
Do you want to come?

1356
01:09:11,409 --> 01:09:12,368
Hey.

1357
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:14,370
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetheart.

1358
01:09:17,206 --> 01:09:19,083
- Hey, Dad.
- Tom.

1359
01:09:19,124 --> 01:09:21,001
This is Eli.

1360
01:09:21,043 --> 01:09:22,461
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

1361
01:09:22,502 --> 01:09:23,503
- Hello, Eli.
- Hi.

1362
01:09:23,545 --> 01:09:26,047
Nice to meet you.

1363
01:09:26,089 --> 01:09:28,174
Why don't we all sit down?

1364
01:09:28,216 --> 01:09:30,176
Lydia and I can share a menu.

1365
01:09:31,677 --> 01:09:33,679
I'll get another setup.

1366
01:09:33,721 --> 01:09:35,472
You guys want coffee
orjuice or anything?

1367
01:09:35,514 --> 01:09:37,182
Yeah, coffee with milk.

1368
01:09:37,266 --> 01:09:41,144
Can I get a mimosa and a coffee?
And a water.

1369
01:09:41,186 --> 01:09:43,605
You'll fill up on liquids.
Save room for your meal.

1370
01:09:43,647 --> 01:09:45,440
- Leave him alone, Lydia.
- I wasn't criticizing.

1371
01:09:45,482 --> 01:09:48,151
He's obviously old enough
to please himself.

1372
01:09:50,528 --> 01:09:53,114
So... what have you guys
been up to?

1373
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:58,577
Not much, really. We got back
from Keenan on Friday...

1374
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:01,496
and then I took the girls
from my church group

1375
01:10:01,538 --> 01:10:03,164
to see "Phantom of the Opera."

1376
01:10:03,206 --> 01:10:04,416
Is that still running?

1377
01:10:04,457 --> 01:10:06,459
It was Friday night.

1378
01:10:06,501 --> 01:10:08,711
Right, I didn't know.

1379
01:10:08,795 --> 01:10:10,755
Father: $75 a shot.

1380
01:10:10,838 --> 01:10:12,798
It's absurd. It's like throwing
money in the trash.

1381
01:10:12,882 --> 01:10:15,217
- It's theater, Jim.
- It's trash, Lydia.

1382
01:10:15,259 --> 01:10:17,970
Tom: All right, all right.
How was it up at Keenan?

1383
01:10:22,223 --> 01:10:23,808
What? What's wrong?

1384
01:10:23,850 --> 01:10:25,685
Now's not the time, honey.

1385
01:10:25,727 --> 01:10:28,521
So there's a right time
to ask about Amy?

1386
01:10:31,398 --> 01:10:33,442
- Stupid.
- Excuse me?

1387
01:10:33,484 --> 01:10:34,651
You heard me, Lydia.

1388
01:10:34,693 --> 01:10:37,112
You talk to me like that,
you'll see what you get from me.

1389
01:10:37,154 --> 01:10:38,530
Is that a threat, Lydia?

1390
01:10:38,572 --> 01:10:41,157
- Dad, could you not-
- Shut up, Tom.

1391
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:43,201
Mother: That's rich.

1392
01:10:47,705 --> 01:10:49,165
Let's go.

1393
01:10:49,248 --> 01:10:51,292
Come on, let's go.

1394
01:10:51,333 --> 01:10:53,669
Let go of me,
don't do that.

1395
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:56,088
Don't do that,
get your hands off me.

1396
01:10:57,381 --> 01:11:00,550
- I told you do not...
- You always do this...

1397
01:11:11,018 --> 01:11:12,019
Let's go.

1398
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:16,523
Tom, the valet's that way.

1399
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:19,359
I'm not ready. If you want
to go, I'll take a cab.

1400
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:31,954
It's a nice club.

1401
01:11:33,205 --> 01:11:34,623
You think if
I were half Jewish,

1402
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:36,625
they'd let me halfway
in the pool?

1403
01:11:42,714 --> 01:11:44,131
I'm really sorry.

1404
01:11:47,134 --> 01:11:49,136
You didn't do anything.

1405
01:11:52,264 --> 01:11:53,223
Who's Amy?

1406
01:11:57,894 --> 01:12:00,104
She's my sister.

1407
01:12:00,146 --> 01:12:02,690
What? I didn't know
you had a sister.

1408
01:12:06,944 --> 01:12:08,612
I have a sister- Amy.

1409
01:12:08,654 --> 01:12:11,448
She lives up north
in a special needs facility.

1410
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:13,450
- Was she in an accident?
- No, no.

1411
01:12:13,492 --> 01:12:15,910
F.A.S. Do you know
what that is?

1412
01:12:15,952 --> 01:12:17,912
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.
Any other questions?

1413
01:12:17,954 --> 01:12:19,372
I'm on your side, remember?

1414
01:12:19,414 --> 01:12:22,917
I don't want anyone
on my side, remember?

1415
01:12:24,126 --> 01:12:27,963
You thinkjust because we
fucked, that makes us "we"?

1416
01:12:28,005 --> 01:12:30,591
I didn't ask for this,
for you. Sojust stop.

1417
01:12:30,632 --> 01:12:33,301
You called me, remember?
So make up your fucking mind.

1418
01:12:33,343 --> 01:12:37,138
How many ways do you need to be
told to leave me the fuck alone?

1419
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:40,057
You know what, asshole?
Just one.

1420
01:12:53,862 --> 01:12:56,322
Alls I know is-

1421
01:12:56,364 --> 01:13:00,326
all I know is if I wasn't
loaded half the time,

1422
01:13:00,368 --> 01:13:02,161
I probably wouldn't be
in this mess.

1423
01:13:02,203 --> 01:13:04,246
Don't you feel like
the older you get,

1424
01:13:04,288 --> 01:13:05,831
the less you really
know about anything?

1425
01:13:05,873 --> 01:13:08,333
Absolutely. I don't know shit.

1426
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:11,294
People thinkjust because
I managed to make it to 60

1427
01:13:11,336 --> 01:13:13,588
without getting
a Colombian necklace

1428
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:15,465
or getting run over
by a UPS truck,

1429
01:13:15,506 --> 01:13:17,884
that I have the answers
to life's questions.

1430
01:13:19,051 --> 01:13:22,138
Great, so there's
no hope.

1431
01:13:22,179 --> 01:13:23,430
Don't do that.

1432
01:13:23,472 --> 01:13:25,182
I'm not that Deepak Chopra

1433
01:13:25,224 --> 01:13:26,725
or whatever the hell
he calls himself.

1434
01:13:26,767 --> 01:13:28,310
He tells you, if you believe
in yourself,

1435
01:13:28,393 --> 01:13:30,937
you can do anything- pish!

1436
01:13:31,021 --> 01:13:34,983
Alls I know is, you keep your
two eyes on your own paper

1437
01:13:35,066 --> 01:13:37,068
and both hands on the wheel.

1438
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:39,070
And a multi-vitamin
can't hurt.

1439
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:43,657
So I guess the lesson's the same
with booze as it is with guys.

1440
01:13:43,699 --> 01:13:47,536
Wanting it and having it...
totally not the same thing.

1441
01:13:48,411 --> 01:13:50,664
I'll be right back.
The bathroom.

1442
01:14:02,132 --> 01:14:03,592
Hey.

1443
01:14:03,634 --> 01:14:07,846
Sometimes I think
you can want it and have it.

1444
01:14:10,098 --> 01:14:12,600
And now what happens now?

1445
01:14:12,642 --> 01:14:15,311
Now?

1446
01:14:15,353 --> 01:14:17,355
You mean about Eli
being at the wedding?

1447
01:14:17,438 --> 01:14:19,398
That's not what I meant.

1448
01:14:22,192 --> 01:14:24,695
Wait, wait, wait.

1449
01:14:24,736 --> 01:14:27,864
You made me wait too long.
Think too much about it.

1450
01:14:27,906 --> 01:14:29,783
Told you... negative.

1451
01:14:29,824 --> 01:14:30,992
Great.

1452
01:14:31,034 --> 01:14:33,286
I guess that's it.

1453
01:14:34,537 --> 01:14:36,497
It's nice meeting you.

1454
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:38,958
You'll be seeing a lot more
of me, you'll see.

1455
01:14:38,999 --> 01:14:41,543
Now that I'm off relationships
and just doing one night stands.

1456
01:14:41,585 --> 01:14:43,587
Yeah, sure.

1457
01:14:43,629 --> 01:14:46,173
Take a condom.

1458
01:14:46,214 --> 01:14:48,174
We used to put candy in this.

1459
01:14:48,216 --> 01:14:50,927
Anyway, sorry I talked
your ear off.

1460
01:14:50,969 --> 01:14:53,971
Please, it's better than
a fucking movie, sweetheart.

1461
01:14:55,556 --> 01:14:58,142
Don't you need
a parking validation?

1462
01:14:58,183 --> 01:15:00,853
Right, thank you.

1463
01:15:00,894 --> 01:15:03,772
- ( phone ringing )
- Wait a second.

1464
01:15:03,814 --> 01:15:05,857
Feedback Clinic,
this is Esther.

1465
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:10,403
Hi, honey, how you doing?

1466
01:15:10,486 --> 01:15:13,698
What? Go ahead, ask me.

1467
01:15:15,616 --> 01:15:18,869
I'm not a mind reader.

1468
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:21,705
You ever see me on the fucking
Psychic Friends Network channel?

1469
01:15:24,874 --> 01:15:26,543
Would... would you just
shut up for a minute?

1470
01:15:26,584 --> 01:15:28,544
So don't tell me.

1471
01:15:30,922 --> 01:15:33,507
Trust me, Esther-
one night stands.

1472
01:15:35,009 --> 01:15:37,302
It's all black and white
for you, isn't it?

1473
01:15:37,344 --> 01:15:38,137
What?

1474
01:15:38,178 --> 01:15:42,724
I have been married
to that putz for 42 years.

1475
01:15:42,808 --> 01:15:46,394
The strongest, healthiest man
all his life.

1476
01:15:46,478 --> 01:15:49,313
And all of a sudden,
he gets sick.

1477
01:15:49,355 --> 01:15:51,983
Lung cancer.

1478
01:15:52,024 --> 01:15:54,652
He never smoked a day
in his life.

1479
01:15:56,111 --> 01:15:58,989
Pretty fucking ironic, isn't it?

1480
01:15:59,031 --> 01:16:01,992
He's even got a someone taking
care of him in the afternoon.

1481
01:16:02,033 --> 01:16:03,993
Just like a little boy.

1482
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:11,625
But he's dying, and if I stop
hawking him and giving him shit,

1483
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:15,796
calling him asshole,
he'll know he's dying.

1484
01:16:15,879 --> 01:16:17,839
So I don't stop.

1485
01:16:19,049 --> 01:16:22,135
Plus, he is an asshole,
so that's a bonus.

1486
01:16:25,138 --> 01:16:28,891
So I've got my grandmother's
ring. That's old and borrowed.

1487
01:16:28,933 --> 01:16:30,810
And Rachel got me
that blue thong.

1488
01:16:30,851 --> 01:16:32,186
Hoochie floss.

1489
01:16:32,228 --> 01:16:34,605
You got something else
that's new and blue?

1490
01:16:34,646 --> 01:16:36,148
Actually, I do.

1491
01:16:37,524 --> 01:16:40,235
Holy shit, Tom!
What happened?

1492
01:16:40,277 --> 01:16:42,570
Bad date.

1493
01:16:42,612 --> 01:16:45,198
What did you do,
pick him up on the street?

1494
01:16:45,239 --> 01:16:46,866
Worse- AA.

1495
01:16:46,908 --> 01:16:49,535
Apparently he uses sex
to work through anger,

1496
01:16:49,577 --> 01:16:52,037
which is fine when you're
not quite that angry.

1497
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:55,916
What am I going to do with you?
Give me that.

1498
01:16:55,958 --> 01:16:58,335
I smell a lecture.

1499
01:16:58,376 --> 01:17:00,337
Fuck you, Tom.

1500
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:03,756
You blow off a great guy who,
by the way, doesn't hit

1501
01:17:03,798 --> 01:17:06,425
because he made the tragic
mistake offalling for you.

1502
01:17:06,467 --> 01:17:08,469
And instead you're doing
Ike and Tina Turner

1503
01:17:08,511 --> 01:17:10,638
with some asshole from AA.

1504
01:17:10,679 --> 01:17:12,848
At least he's not
at Williams Sonoma

1505
01:17:12,890 --> 01:17:15,350
registering for our
commitment ceremony.

1506
01:17:16,935 --> 01:17:19,604
You're right. You're right,
Eli is such a loser.

1507
01:17:20,647 --> 01:17:22,649
I'm going home.

1508
01:17:37,954 --> 01:17:39,914
Holy shit.

1509
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:44,919
- What's the matter?
- What? Nothing.

1510
01:17:44,961 --> 01:17:47,421
Bullshit. Why aren't you
getting dressed?

1511
01:17:47,463 --> 01:17:51,341
I'm nervous about seeing Tom
at the wedding, that's all.

1512
01:17:52,593 --> 01:17:56,554
Only you could turn my wedding day
into the Eli Wyckoff show.

1513
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:59,432
I'm sorry. Believe me, nobody
can hate me as much as I do.

1514
01:17:59,474 --> 01:18:03,352
Oh my God, you have
to change the fucking record.

1515
01:18:03,394 --> 01:18:05,396
You have to stop.

1516
01:18:05,438 --> 01:18:08,774
You cannot make this the be-all and
end-all of your entire life.

1517
01:18:08,816 --> 01:18:10,109
I'm not.

1518
01:18:10,150 --> 01:18:11,109
That's exactly
what you're doing.

1519
01:18:11,151 --> 01:18:12,277
Let me tell you something.

1520
01:18:12,319 --> 01:18:14,779
Love is going to come
up and whack you

1521
01:18:14,821 --> 01:18:17,574
- in the head before you know it.
- I don't believe that.

1522
01:18:17,615 --> 01:18:20,451
- That happened to me and Jackie.
- You were lucky.

1523
01:18:20,493 --> 01:18:22,119
You're unbelievable.

1524
01:18:22,161 --> 01:18:25,789
I was miserable before I met
her, and itjust happens.

1525
01:18:25,789 --> 01:18:27,958
You're a fucking amazing guy.

1526
01:18:28,042 --> 01:18:29,710
You don't have
to do this, don't-

1527
01:18:29,793 --> 01:18:31,461
Please shut up.
You're a great guy.

1528
01:18:31,503 --> 01:18:33,755
If I were into guys,

1529
01:18:33,797 --> 01:18:35,090
we'd be in China right now
picking out a baby.

1530
01:18:35,131 --> 01:18:37,050
Thank God I'm not, but...

1531
01:18:37,133 --> 01:18:38,801
Kidding. You know
I love the gays.

1532
01:18:38,843 --> 01:18:40,261
And we appreciate it.

1533
01:18:40,303 --> 01:18:43,222
- Guys?
- Mitch?

1534
01:18:43,264 --> 01:18:45,849
I don't know if it's just me,
but I love it.

1535
01:18:45,891 --> 01:18:47,434
You like the tux?

1536
01:18:47,518 --> 01:18:49,436
Loving it.

1537
01:18:49,478 --> 01:18:51,855
Mitch, remember when we
discussed the Ritalin situation?

1538
01:18:57,944 --> 01:18:59,862
Please put on your pants...

1539
01:18:59,904 --> 01:19:02,073
or get a tan.

1540
01:19:02,156 --> 01:19:04,575
Get doubles.
I want all of these.

1541
01:19:04,617 --> 01:19:05,659
When my sister got married,

1542
01:19:05,743 --> 01:19:07,828
the best pictures were
from the Instamatics.

1543
01:19:07,911 --> 01:19:10,247
Your sister got married?

1544
01:19:10,288 --> 01:19:10,997
Yes.

1545
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:13,625
Fuck, what is my problem?

1546
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:16,252
I'm like man poison.

1547
01:19:16,294 --> 01:19:18,129
Fucking penis Raid.

1548
01:19:18,171 --> 01:19:19,589
Whatever!

1549
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:22,133
Girls... how do I look?

1550
01:19:22,216 --> 01:19:26,345
Oh my God, you look
like a movie star.

1551
01:19:26,386 --> 01:19:27,346
Really?

1552
01:19:27,387 --> 01:19:28,805
- Yes.
- Totally.

1553
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:29,681
Seriously.

1554
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:31,725
In a million years,

1555
01:19:31,766 --> 01:19:34,310
I never thought I'd be
wearing white this soon.

1556
01:19:34,394 --> 01:19:36,646
You shouldn't be, unless
you want me to call the Pope

1557
01:19:36,729 --> 01:19:38,689
and tell him
it happened again.

1558
01:19:38,773 --> 01:19:40,566
I would've worn the cream one,

1559
01:19:40,608 --> 01:19:43,569
except it made me look like
a Jenny Craig "before" picture.

1560
01:19:43,652 --> 01:19:45,988
Are you crazy?

1561
01:19:46,029 --> 01:19:47,698
Where's Tom?

1562
01:19:47,739 --> 01:19:50,617
He's on the patio.
He is a man, after all.

1563
01:19:50,659 --> 01:19:53,661
Repellent. Gay or
straight, it doesn't matter.

1564
01:19:55,079 --> 01:19:58,082
Put that out. You're killing
my unborn child.

1565
01:19:58,124 --> 01:19:59,708
I was aiming a little higher.

1566
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:02,795
Nice. What are you
doing out here?

1567
01:20:07,507 --> 01:20:11,177
Oh my God,
Eli was stalking you?

1568
01:20:11,219 --> 01:20:13,721
That is so romantic.

1569
01:20:13,763 --> 01:20:15,765
Not to me.

1570
01:20:16,891 --> 01:20:19,393
That's right.
But if he tried to kill you,

1571
01:20:19,435 --> 01:20:21,979
then you'd be picking out
china patterns.

1572
01:20:22,021 --> 01:20:23,981
Are you all right?

1573
01:20:25,107 --> 01:20:27,692
Yeah.

1574
01:20:27,734 --> 01:20:31,070
You're getting married.
I'm having abandonment issues.

1575
01:20:31,112 --> 01:20:32,822
I'm just extending
the family, babe.

1576
01:20:32,864 --> 01:20:34,365
Woman: Jackie, let's go.

1577
01:20:34,449 --> 01:20:36,409
We'll be right there.

1578
01:20:42,915 --> 01:20:44,875
Tom, I owe you an apology.

1579
01:20:45,959 --> 01:20:47,252
For what?

1580
01:20:47,294 --> 01:20:50,421
The way I've been
pressuring you about Eli.

1581
01:20:50,463 --> 01:20:52,423
And I realize that
I've just been trying

1582
01:20:52,465 --> 01:20:55,384
to make you like everybody else
and you're not.

1583
01:20:55,426 --> 01:20:57,386
And that's one of things
I love about you.

1584
01:20:58,929 --> 01:21:00,347
You're the only guy I know

1585
01:21:00,389 --> 01:21:02,808
who will probably never find
that one person

1586
01:21:02,849 --> 01:21:05,018
to settle down with
and still be very happy.

1587
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:08,438
I envy that.

1588
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:11,691
Jackie, get your ass in here
or I'm wearing the veil.

1589
01:21:13,276 --> 01:21:16,112
We're coming.

1590
01:21:16,195 --> 01:21:18,864
But look at me. Shit!

1591
01:21:18,947 --> 01:21:21,908
I'm like one step away
from den mother, PTA,

1592
01:21:21,992 --> 01:21:24,202
and "Hi, Honey,
I'm home."

1593
01:21:24,244 --> 01:21:25,954
How the fuck
did that happen?

1594
01:21:25,996 --> 01:21:28,831
Guess you fell in love.

1595
01:21:28,873 --> 01:21:30,208
What?

1596
01:21:30,249 --> 01:21:32,752
No, I just got lipstick all over
every single one of my teeth.

1597
01:21:32,835 --> 01:21:34,795
How did I do that?

1598
01:21:40,342 --> 01:21:42,969
It's show time.

1599
01:21:43,011 --> 01:21:44,971
You may exchange the rings.

1600
01:21:46,556 --> 01:21:48,558
Wow, that's a nice one.

1601
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:59,109
Congratulations, I now pronounce
you man and wife.

1602
01:21:59,151 --> 01:22:00,193
You may kiss the bride.

1603
01:22:00,235 --> 01:22:02,154
( glass breaking )

1604
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,560
Eli.

1605
01:22:38,729 --> 01:22:40,689
- Eli.
- Yeah?

1606
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:45,902
How long are we going to have
to keep ignoring each other?

1607
01:22:46,944 --> 01:22:49,989
What? I'm not ignoring you.

1608
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:51,866
You ignoring me?

1609
01:22:51,907 --> 01:22:53,992
Come on, Eli.

1610
01:22:54,034 --> 01:22:56,203
You haven't returned
one of my phone calls.

1611
01:22:56,245 --> 01:22:59,247
And you've said maybe three
words to me the entire day,

1612
01:22:59,331 --> 01:23:00,749
two of which were
"seafood newburg."

1613
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:03,585
Which I have to say
was repulsive.

1614
01:23:06,045 --> 01:23:08,089
Can I get some more Champagne?
Champagne?

1615
01:23:08,130 --> 01:23:09,548
No, can I get a-

1616
01:23:09,548 --> 01:23:10,674
That's right, I'm sorry.

1617
01:23:10,758 --> 01:23:13,218
Absolut Martini, straight up,
two olives. Make it dirty.

1618
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:15,595
No, actually seltzer
with lime, please.

1619
01:23:18,515 --> 01:23:21,226
So now you're not drinking?

1620
01:23:25,062 --> 01:23:26,689
Wow.

1621
01:23:26,772 --> 01:23:28,858
Good for you.

1622
01:23:28,941 --> 01:23:30,901
Thanks.

1623
01:23:31,276 --> 01:23:34,196
I sorta had to-
I was slipping in the polls.

1624
01:23:37,407 --> 01:23:40,243
I, on the other hand,
need more Champagne.

1625
01:24:02,263 --> 01:24:05,641
- I'm sorry I didn't-
- Let's not do any of that,

1626
01:24:05,683 --> 01:24:09,144
"I'm sorry, it didn't work out"
post-mortem stuff, okay?

1627
01:24:10,437 --> 01:24:13,231
Okay.

1628
01:24:13,273 --> 01:24:15,859
Besides, it'll free up some time
to make fun of people.

1629
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:20,530
Like Mitch, the man of mystery,
teaching the rabbi the Macarena.

1630
01:24:20,571 --> 01:24:22,406
What is this, 1987?

1631
01:24:22,448 --> 01:24:25,117
Did you see Bret's mom?

1632
01:24:25,159 --> 01:24:27,411
I've never seen a woman
with more hair on her back.

1633
01:24:27,453 --> 01:24:29,288
I keep waiting
for the anti-fur activists

1634
01:24:29,329 --> 01:24:30,872
to storm in here
and throw paint on her.

1635
01:24:32,165 --> 01:24:34,668
Tom: Poor Brett and Jackie.

1636
01:24:34,751 --> 01:24:36,586
They have no idea what they've
gotten themselves into.

1637
01:24:36,628 --> 01:24:37,629
But they will, mark my words.

1638
01:24:37,712 --> 01:24:41,132
First they'll only
hang out with other couples.

1639
01:24:41,132 --> 01:24:43,134
Then they'll start doing
the "we" thing.

1640
01:24:43,217 --> 01:24:46,011
"We love this,
and we hate that."

1641
01:24:46,053 --> 01:24:47,638
And ordering
for each other,

1642
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:49,473
because that's what
"we" always have.

1643
01:24:49,473 --> 01:24:51,099
Before you know it,

1644
01:24:51,141 --> 01:24:53,185
she'll be shopping for lingerie
at Bloomingdales.

1645
01:24:53,226 --> 01:24:54,644
And Brett,
the poor loser,

1646
01:24:54,686 --> 01:24:55,770
will be outside
the dressing room

1647
01:24:55,854 --> 01:24:57,814
with her pocketbook
in his lap.

1648
01:25:00,316 --> 01:25:01,817
Oh my God.

1649
01:25:01,859 --> 01:25:04,403
You are so full of shit,
you know that?

1650
01:25:04,445 --> 01:25:07,656
You got this bullshit,
"I don't need anyone" thing.

1651
01:25:07,656 --> 01:25:08,907
And you use that,

1652
01:25:08,991 --> 01:25:10,909
thinking it's going to shield
you from the fact

1653
01:25:10,951 --> 01:25:13,578
that your parents were drunks,
had a lousy marriage,

1654
01:25:13,662 --> 01:25:15,413
and fucked up everyone
in their lives.

1655
01:25:15,455 --> 01:25:18,207
But it's your life now,
not theirs.

1656
01:25:18,249 --> 01:25:19,959
And what do you have
to show for it?

1657
01:25:20,001 --> 01:25:22,920
You're just another self-hating
recovering alcoholic

1658
01:25:22,962 --> 01:25:25,964
with nothing to live for
but a martini and a blowjob.

1659
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:34,597
Eli. Eli!

1660
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:35,682
Hey!

1661
01:25:35,723 --> 01:25:37,975
( dishes crashing )

1662
01:25:38,017 --> 01:25:41,103
Don't you dare sum me up.

1663
01:25:41,187 --> 01:25:43,022
You don't know the first thing
about me.

1664
01:25:43,063 --> 01:25:45,482
And that would be who's fault?

1665
01:25:45,524 --> 01:25:48,568
God, it's so easy
for you, Mr.,

1666
01:25:48,652 --> 01:25:51,029
love-is-a-many-splendored-thing.

1667
01:25:51,071 --> 01:25:53,865
But you know what?
I've seen it. I've seen it.

1668
01:25:53,865 --> 01:25:56,951
My parents loved one another.
Until death do us part.

1669
01:25:56,993 --> 01:25:58,661
And believe me,
it practically came to that.

1670
01:25:58,703 --> 01:26:01,372
Have you ever heard the sound

1671
01:26:01,372 --> 01:26:06,084
of two people suffocating
one another? Have you?

1672
01:26:06,126 --> 01:26:09,671
Or the sound of ice cubes
smashing against the wall?

1673
01:26:09,713 --> 01:26:13,091
Or a pot roast being
shoved down the disposal? No!

1674
01:26:13,132 --> 01:26:14,676
How could you possibly,

1675
01:26:14,717 --> 01:26:18,387
with your touchy-feely "I'm
okay, you're okay" parents.

1676
01:26:20,598 --> 01:26:23,600
I'm sorry I'm bursting
your little bubble.

1677
01:26:23,684 --> 01:26:25,644
But there are
a million guys out there

1678
01:26:25,686 --> 01:26:28,396
who can give you
what you want.

1679
01:26:28,396 --> 01:26:30,398
I'm just not one of them.

1680
01:26:32,233 --> 01:26:34,735
I'm sorry.

1681
01:26:34,735 --> 01:26:36,737
You do the math.

1682
01:26:38,906 --> 01:26:41,325
You know what?

1683
01:26:41,367 --> 01:26:44,077
Fuck you if that's the wrong use
of that expression.

1684
01:26:57,298 --> 01:27:02,469
- If could I bring you back -

1685
01:27:02,511 --> 01:27:06,681
- That'd be the sweetest thing -

1686
01:27:06,723 --> 01:27:10,476
- If I could bring you back -

1687
01:27:10,518 --> 01:27:15,106
- I would do anything -

1688
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:19,193
- If I could bring you back... -

1689
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:24,281
- To me. -

1690
01:27:50,513 --> 01:27:52,473
I just wanted to say,
before I go...

1691
01:27:54,642 --> 01:27:56,644
I'm sorry.

1692
01:27:58,979 --> 01:28:00,314
I don't want you
to leave here today

1693
01:28:00,314 --> 01:28:03,608
thinking that you can't
do this-

1694
01:28:04,901 --> 01:28:06,861
be in a...

1695
01:28:09,405 --> 01:28:11,365
Because you can.

1696
01:28:12,658 --> 01:28:14,410
Tom, you are going
to meet someone,

1697
01:28:16,995 --> 01:28:19,414
and you're going to be
so great at this.

1698
01:28:21,666 --> 01:28:23,668
It's not going to be
like your parents,

1699
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:28,089
and it's not going to be
like it was with me.

1700
01:28:33,219 --> 01:28:35,179
Anyway, uh...

1701
01:28:38,849 --> 01:28:40,850
I'll see you around.

1702
01:28:41,851 --> 01:28:43,436
Eli...

1703
01:28:43,478 --> 01:28:45,855
What?

1704
01:28:45,897 --> 01:28:47,857
What exactly do you want?

1705
01:28:51,861 --> 01:28:53,112
W-what do I...

1706
01:28:53,153 --> 01:28:56,531
Yeah... you.

1707
01:28:59,618 --> 01:29:03,955
I wanted this to stop
being so fucking hard.

1708
01:29:08,668 --> 01:29:10,586
I want to meet your sister.

1709
01:29:14,631 --> 01:29:16,174
I want to be over this part,

1710
01:29:16,216 --> 01:29:20,929
so I can call you an asshole
even when you're sick,

1711
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:24,390
and you'd still know
how much I love you.

1712
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:25,433
Eli.

1713
01:29:25,475 --> 01:29:27,101
I don't know
what you call that, Tom.

1714
01:29:27,143 --> 01:29:30,521
Pocketbook holding,
suffocating... maybe.

1715
01:29:32,481 --> 01:29:34,191
But if I could ever have
anything even close to that-

1716
01:29:34,233 --> 01:29:36,193
Eli!

1717
01:30:02,633 --> 01:30:04,594
I'm gonna go.

1718
01:30:06,262 --> 01:30:08,222
Valet's got my car.

1719
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:12,684
There you are!

1720
01:30:12,768 --> 01:30:14,227
- Eli, hey.
- Hey.

1721
01:30:14,269 --> 01:30:16,521
Should I? Or is this...
is everything okay?

1722
01:30:16,563 --> 01:30:19,440
Yeah, yeah.
What's up with the braid?

1723
01:30:19,482 --> 01:30:22,735
Brett did it.
It's a long story.

1724
01:30:22,777 --> 01:30:24,612
I need to take
a personal moment.

1725
01:30:24,612 --> 01:30:25,613
What's the matter?
You're not having fun?

1726
01:30:25,654 --> 01:30:27,573
I was until
about five minutes ago.

1727
01:30:27,615 --> 01:30:29,867
What happened?

1728
01:30:29,908 --> 01:30:31,785
I put my left foot in
I put my left foot out

1729
01:30:31,827 --> 01:30:34,079
I put my left foot in
and then I threw up.

1730
01:30:35,622 --> 01:30:36,623
The baby?

1731
01:30:36,664 --> 01:30:39,250
No. Bret's cousin Al
bumped his pokey into my hokey

1732
01:30:39,292 --> 01:30:40,877
and I borsched.

1733
01:30:40,918 --> 01:30:43,170
I think Brett is the only
normal person in that family.

1734
01:30:44,296 --> 01:30:45,798
Can we talk about
his brother Mitch?

01:30:45,881 --> 01:30:47,800
Hello, Freakie-McFreak.

1736
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,343
He wants tojoin
Cirque du Soleil.

1737
01:30:49,426 --> 01:30:51,303
He says he can swallow
his own leg.

1738
01:30:53,305 --> 01:30:54,806
What's up?

1739
01:30:54,806 --> 01:30:56,432
How you doing?

1740
01:30:56,474 --> 01:30:57,684
What am I missing?

1741
01:30:57,725 --> 01:30:59,310
Just a family resemblance.

1742
01:30:59,352 --> 01:31:00,520
And I love you for it.

1743
01:31:00,561 --> 01:31:02,980
Okay. I don't know
what that means.

1744
01:31:03,022 --> 01:31:04,356
I'm really smashed...

1745
01:31:04,398 --> 01:31:07,067
I think I just made out
with the rabbi.

1746
01:31:07,109 --> 01:31:08,068
He is hot.

1747
01:31:08,110 --> 01:31:09,069
Is there dancing?

1748
01:31:09,111 --> 01:31:10,112
Are we going to dance?

1749
01:31:10,153 --> 01:31:13,365
Because I promised the family
some hot man-on-man action.

1750
01:31:13,406 --> 01:31:15,325
- You and me?
- No...

1751
01:31:15,366 --> 01:31:17,327
I think he means me and you.

1752
01:31:17,327 --> 01:31:18,786
Come on guys, let's go.

1753
01:31:18,828 --> 01:31:19,996
It's going to be fun.

1754
01:31:20,037 --> 01:31:21,747
Come on, sweetheart.

1755
01:31:21,789 --> 01:31:23,582
Bret: Look at that ass!

1756
01:31:23,624 --> 01:31:25,084
A little something like that...

1757
01:31:33,008 --> 01:31:35,593
Eli: I just had my hip replaced.

1758
01:31:35,635 --> 01:31:37,553
How hot does this broad look?

1759
01:31:38,679 --> 01:31:41,640
Tom: I finally saw
"Gone With The Wind."

1760
01:31:41,682 --> 01:31:43,100
And?

1761
01:31:43,142 --> 01:31:44,643
And, I loved it.

1762
01:31:44,685 --> 01:31:46,228
Oh, thank God.

1763
01:31:46,270 --> 01:31:48,522
I think Scarlett realizes
in the end

1764
01:31:48,563 --> 01:31:50,815
that it was just fear
holding her back from the guy

1765
01:31:50,857 --> 01:31:53,193
that she wanted to...
you know.

1766
01:31:53,234 --> 01:31:54,235
Eli: Hold her pocket book?

1767
01:31:55,820 --> 01:31:57,446
Yeah.

1768
01:31:57,488 --> 01:31:58,864
And I think
about Rhett Butler.

1769
01:31:58,864 --> 01:32:00,366
Yeah?

1770
01:32:00,366 --> 01:32:03,160
He wasn't very fuzzy.
Was he?

1771
01:32:03,202 --> 01:32:06,955

- It's the least I can do -

1776
01:32:27,933 --> 01:32:31,895
- Just to make you my baby, -

1777
01:32:31,936 --> 01:32:35,982
- No words can describe -

1778
01:32:36,023 --> 01:32:39,902
- Ah, pinch me I'm dreamin' -

1779
01:32:39,944 --> 01:32:42,905
- Your hair's long and black -

1780
01:32:42,905 --> 01:32:47,826
- As it lays cross my pillow -

1781
01:32:47,867 --> 01:32:50,745
- When I stare in your eyes -

1782
01:32:50,787 --> 01:32:55,124
- I get lost in your glory -

1783
01:32:55,207 --> 01:32:58,711
- I'll never be -

1784
01:32:58,794 --> 01:33:01,088
- All you want me to -

1785
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:02,673
- But that's all right, -

1786
01:33:06,092 --> 01:33:10,013
- I'm gonna make you love me -

1787
01:33:10,054 --> 01:33:13,933
- I'm gonna dry your tears, -

1788
01:33:13,933 --> 01:33:16,519
- We're gonna stay together -

1789
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:17,770
- For a million... -

1790
01:33:17,811 --> 01:33:21,773
- I'm gonna make you love me -

1791
01:33:21,773 --> 01:33:25,694

1792
01:33:25,735 --> 01:33:28,238
- We're gonna stay together -

1793
01:33:28,279 --> 01:33:30,740
- For a million years. -

1794
01:33:48,673 --> 01:33:52,510
- If the silence
doesn't kill it, -

1795
01:33:52,551 --> 01:33:54,720
- Then illusion will -

1796
01:33:59,808 --> 01:34:02,435
- And you're staring
at the sky, -

1797
01:34:02,477 --> 01:34:05,605
- But the moon ain't
gonna pay our bills -

1798
01:34:10,443 --> 01:34:12,987
- And we're laughin'
'bout it loud, -

1799
01:34:13,028 --> 01:34:15,990
- When, oh, you know
it ain't nojoke -

1800
01:34:20,786 --> 01:34:24,497
- You see them kick the rose
with glitter, -

1801
01:34:24,497 --> 01:34:26,791
- Trade your dreams for smoke -

1802
01:34:32,046 --> 01:34:35,382
- Tear drops in the tree tops, -

1803
01:34:35,466 --> 01:34:38,218
- The wind is whistling
through the mountain's teeth -

1804
01:34:42,514 --> 01:34:48,686
- A soul for every wounded dove -

1805
01:34:54,900 --> 01:35:00,739
- We're out further
than the rainbow's edge -
