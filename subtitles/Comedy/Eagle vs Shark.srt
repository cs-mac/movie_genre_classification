00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,282
"Lily...

2
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:22,951
I brought you here today to ask you
a very special question".

3
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:26,250
"What is it?"

4
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:32,457
"Well, I've never felt this way
about anyone before".

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,829
"Same,
but it feels really natural".

6
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,233
"Yeah, same.

7
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,002
I feel that too".

8
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:44,605
<i>"Now, Lily...</i>

9
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,509
Will you be my girlfriend?"

10
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,175
"Yes.

11
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,384
Yes I will".

12
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:54,320
"Awesome".

13
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:59,251
"You have made me the happiest man
in the whole restaurant.

14
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,457
I love you".

15
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,230
"I love you too."

16
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,049
Hi.

17
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:34,678
Hello. Welcome to Meaty Boy.
I'm Lily. Can I take your order?

18
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:35,686
What?

19
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:39,020
Hello. I'm Lily. Welcome to Meaty Boy.
Can I take your order?

20
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,424
Ah, yeah.
Just a Mega-Meaty meal, please.

21
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:44,052
Sure. Could I interest you
in the crazy burger?

22
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,463
It's meat and then bread and then more
meat. It's like an inside-out burger.

23
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:51,961
- No, just the, the Meaty Meal.
- I'll just go get that for you.

24
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,269
Kaylee, can I've a Mega-Meaty meal.
- Okay, Lily.

25
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,865
- Takeaway.
- I'll just make it, okay?

26
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:57,967
Yep.

27
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,313
- Hi, Tony.
- Hi.

28
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,275
Hey, Jenny.

29
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,285
Thanks, Kaylee.

30
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:13,851
Okay.

31
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,956
Thanks very much for dining
at Meaty Boy.

32
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,793
Please, come back again. Bye.

33
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,168
What size are your...

34
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,410
Keep up the good work,
Meaty Girl.

35
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:41,419
Hi, I'm Jenny. Welcome to Meaty Boy.
Can I help?

36
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,919
Oh, no. You guys can't come over here,
because my till's broken.

37
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,188
Can you please, go over there?

38
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,709
Please, not me.
Please, not me. Please, not me.

39
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:46,411
Like I said, it's management.
They make these decisions.

40
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,246
Please, not me.
Please, not me.

41
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:56,754
Sorry, Lily.

42
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:59,556
It's okay.

43
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,632
Okay, guys.
Let's get back to work.

44
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,005
Sorry it's, it's unlucky.

45
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,610
- You can finish up the week.
- Yep.

46
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,791
<i>The shark is often</i>
<i>a solitary animal.</i>

47
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,157
<i>It's only social contact...</i>

48
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,788
Oh, no. No.

49
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,264
Look, you've eaten already.

50
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,369
Winston's trying to eat
my fish and chips.

51
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,204
Cute.

52
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,902
<i>Attracted from the considerable</i>
<i>distance by the distressed or wounded.</i>

53

00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,651

<i>We're different fruit</i>
<i>From the same tree</i>

56
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,859
That sounds really cool.

57
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,037
Here.

58
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,000
I got the idea when Winston
tried to eat my fish.

59
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,476
Thanks, Damon.
I like that a lot.

60
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,645
I'm really sorry
you lost your job.

61
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,684
They don't know
what they're missing.

62
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,116
And if Mum and Dad were alive,
they'd say the same thing as well.

63
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,821
Thanks, Damon.

64
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,020
Well, it's true.

65
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:38,123
Goodnight, Sis.

66
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,630
Goodnight.

67
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,460
Hello. I'm Lily McKinnon.
Welcome to Meaty Boy.

68
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:46,692
What would you like to eat today?
A Big Boy Burger Meal, I bet.

69
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,924
Yes. A Big Boy Burger Meal,
please.

70
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:50,968
Okay.

71
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,596
Do you want the big fries?

72
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,906
Ah, no.

73
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,408
It's free.
I'll give them to you.

74
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,571
The big size, free.
You'll save a dollar fifty. Free.

75
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:02,571
Okay.

76
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,980
Do you want cheese
on your burger?

77
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,576
- No, thanks.
- It, it's free too.

78
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,177
I'll give it to you.
You'll save sixty cents.

79
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,483
No, thanks. No.

80
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,183
Why?

81
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,252
It's free cheese.

82
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:15,889
Can't eat cheese.

83
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,294
Okay. No cheese.

84
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,564
Okay, I'll just go
and get that for you.

85
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:25,732
Okay, order up, Kaylee.
One Big Boy Burger Meal, please...

86
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,705
hold the cheese,
and one large fries.

87
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,968
Come on guys,
let's try and make this happen.

88
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,070
- You work at Screen Blasterz, eh?
- Yeah.

89
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,605
Yeah, I know that.

90
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:48,519
There you go.

91
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:49,993
Hey, do you know that chick,
Jenny?

92
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,531
Yeah, yeah. She's my best friend.

93
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:57,262
Would you be able to give her this?
It's an invitation to my party.

94
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,535
Oh, cool.

95
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:02,733
Yeah, it's gonna be pretty cool. You get
to dress as your favorite animal.

96
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,105
And there's gonna be games.

97
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,713
My friend has a helmet and he's gonna
let us chuck shoes at his head.

98
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,008
- Oh, cool.
- Yeah.

99
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:15,980
Yeah, so...

100
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:19,122
- Thanks for the fries.
- Bye.

101
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,032
Hi, Jenny.

102
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:32,099
A guy came in today with this invitation
to give to you.

103
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:35,368
- It's for a party, for an animal party.
- An animal party?

104
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,432
Yeah. You go dressed
as your favorite animal.

105
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,068
Think it's gonna be really cool.

106
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:42,412
Do you think there's any potential way
that I could come with you?

107
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,509
Oh, yeah. Cool.
That sounds really cool.

108
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,587
Dick.

109
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,293
Cool costumes.

110
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:13,402
- Thanks.
- I'm Duncan.

111
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,731
- Hi.
- Hi.

112
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:15,831
Can you guess what I am?

113
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,071
- Snake?
- Yes.

114
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:23,971
Hey, Jarrod.

115
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,411
This is Jarrod.
He's my flatmate.

116
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:27,710
- Hi.
- Hi.

117
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,315
- Who are you guys?
- I'm Lily.

118
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,414
- She gave you free fries.
- Damon.

119
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:33,590
Oh, yeah.

120
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,752
- I got some free fries.
- Cool.

121
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,352
Oh, yeah. I told you, eh?

122
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,994
Yeah, you told me.

123
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,558
Where's that chick, Jenny?
Why isn't she here?

124
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,305
She's a lesbian.
She went to a lesbian party.

125
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,864
- Typical.
- Awesome.

126
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,877
Oh, well.
It's getting too crowded here, anyway.

127
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:55,778
I like your costume.

128
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,245
Thanks.

129
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,375
It's pretty much
the second-best outfit here.

130
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,014
So, your favorite animal
is a shark?

131
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,647
- Yep.
- Pretty cool.

132
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,089
I almost came as a shark,
actually...

133
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,183
but then I realized that
an eagle is slightly better.

134
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,155
- What are you supposed to be?
- Tarantula.

135
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,691
- Seven o'clock, Jarrod.
- Okay, let's do this thing.

136
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:20,128
- What's happening?
- It's the Fight Man competition. Come on.

137
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,336
- Cool.
- It's neat.

138
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,243
It's a knockout tournament.
The finalist gets to fight Jarrod.

139
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:30,073
But you most probably won't win.
He's the undefeated champion.

140
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,173
You guys competing?

141
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:32,849
Um, yep.

142
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,816
- You?
- Oh, no. I'm just a spectator.

143
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,521
What's your combat name?

144
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:38,989
What?

145
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,786
You know, you're combat name
for when you're competing.

146
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,959
Jarrod, he's the Eagle Lord.
And I'm Blaze.

147
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:49,896
Mine's...

148
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,568
The Dangerous Person.

149
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,197
Okay.

150
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,203

00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,221
<i>Choose your destiny.</i>

163
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,495
<i>Who are you?</i>

164
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,570
<i>Fight.</i>

165
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,319
<i>Destroy her.</i>

166
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:24,689
<i>Outstanding.</i>

167
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,504
That girl sure knows
how to play her video games, bro.

168
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:38,966
She's alright.

169
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:42,345
<i>Victory.</i>

170
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,739
<i>That's it. Primo!</i>

171
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,842
<i>Fantastic. Flawless victory.</i>

172
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:47,851
Fuck.

173
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,121
- Good stuff, Lily.
- <i>You're good.</i>

174
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:55,126
Okay, so that's the end of the list.
And we're into the finals now.

175
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,294
And Dangerous Person
will take on last year's champion...

176
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,093
and the year before
that's champion...

177
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,154
Eagle Lord.

178
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,135
Gidday.

179
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,108
<i>Fight.</i>

180
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,346
Nice.

181
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:17,604
But no cigar.

182
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,440
<i>Kill her.</i>

183
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,607
<i>Victory.</i>

184
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,353
<i>You win.</i>

185
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,354
Yeah.

186
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,121
- Awesome.
- Great.

187
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:14,764
It's time for my game.

188
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:19,272
- Impressive fighting, Dangerous Person.
- Thanks.

189
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,642
Where'd you learn to play
like that?

190
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,738
I don't know.
I guess I just got into it.

191
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,641
Well, you had some pretty cool moves
for someone who'd never played before.

192
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,717
Takes more than cool moves
to defeat a champion.

193
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:31,917
Don't forget that.

194
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,080
This is a plane I made.

195
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,454
Cool.

196
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,782
Guitar, emery board, fret board.

197
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,321
Painted eggs.

198
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:13,930
Jewellery.

199
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:14,931
Watch wallet.

200
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:20,796
Wow.

201
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,642
This is the area
where I make my candles.

202
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,145
Flame within a flame.

203
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,181
Conceptual.

204
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:31,605
Giant pencil.

205
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,379
Ancient coin.

206
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,748
Probably sell these
to the Muslims.

207
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,282
Sell this one to the Yanks.
Make a mint.

208
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,290
Cool.

209
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,025
I guess I've gotta keep creating
or I'll just die.

210
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,389
Wow.

211
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,295
So who's that Tarantula guy.
Is that your boyfriend?

212
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,298
Oh, no. He's my brother.

213
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,278
He's a cartoonist. And he's
very good at accents and impressions.

214
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,011
My brother's dead.

215
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,644
Oh, I'm sorry.

216
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,451
My parents are dead too.

217
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:16,594
Yeah, well...

218
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,321
My mum's dead as well.

219
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,567
How did your parents die?

220
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:25,660
Heart attacks.

221
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,064
Were they too fat?

222
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,204
Oh, no.

223
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,138
My Dad died when he was 72...

224
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,542
and then my Mum died
because she really missed him.

225
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,403
Yeah well...

226
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,481
my Mum got kicked in the head
by a cow.

227
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,554
Can't go near cows now because of that,
because I think about her too much.

228
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:51,087
I'm so sorry about your mum.
And your brother.

229
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,159
It's cool.

230
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,057
You're pretty beautiful.

231
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:57,724
Same.

232
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,669
Oh, I mean, you are too...

233
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,199
sort of, more handsome.

234
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,171
- Do you wanna kiss?
- Yep.

235
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,743
On the lips, though.

236
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,744
Yep.

237
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,812
Okay.

238
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,782
- Do you wanna have a lie-down on my bed?
- Yep.

239
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:21,791
Okay.

240
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,199
Do you wanna have sex?

241
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:38,374
Yep.

242
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:57,694
Sorry.

243
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:05,459
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello, is Eric there, please?

244
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,691
- <i>Who's speaking?</i>
- The Police.

245
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,529
<i>Okay.</i>

246
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,334
<i>Hello?</i>

247
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,372
You're fuckin' dead,
you fuckin' Samoan... fuck.

248
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,566
<i>Ah, who is this? Stop...</i>

249
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:05,488
Oh, hi.

250
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:07,486
What are you doing here?

251
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,653
Um, I just had a sandwich and I was,
you know, nearby.

252
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,559
That was some pretty good sex
last night.

253
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,161
Okay, well.
I'm going back to work.

254
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:20,295
Okay, bye.

255
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:21,703
- See ya.
- See ya.

256
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:26,911
- Ah, what are you up to tonight?
- I don't know.

257
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,843
I might go to a movie.
You can come if you want.

258
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,405
It's the new Wolverine movie.
It's got Hugh Jackman in it.

259
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:32,780
Apparently I look like him.

260
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,111
Gets pretty tiresome.

261
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,086
"Hey Jarrod,
you look like Wolverine."

262
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:39,784
Sometimes I wish I did have knives
that came out of my fists.

263
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:43,160
Anyway, it's 7:30 at Cine-saurus Rex.
If you want to come...

264
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:44,991
- You can come, I don't care.
- Yep.

265
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,587
Do you?
Okay. Okay. See ya.

266
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:47,597
See ya.

267
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,525
- Jarrod?
- Yeah?

268
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,466
- Eagle, eh?
- What?

269
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,436
Your favorite animal? Eagle?

270
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,336
Yeah, or cobra.

271
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,567
But, yeah,
pretty much eagle rules.

272
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,536
- Okay. See ya.
- See ya.

273
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:13,912
- Hey.
- Hi.

274
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:17,011
Yeah, so I didn't end up going
to that movie. Did you?

275
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:18,385
Yep, oh, no.

276
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:20,413
I knew it.

277
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,686
How did you find out where I live?

278
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,754
I got my flatmate
to ring up your work.

279
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,422
Tell them it was an emergency.

280
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,395
You probably shouldn't go in there.
They think you're dead.

281
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,315
Yeah. I had to be alone.

282
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,508
I got depressed about something.

283
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,309
I suffer from depression.

284
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:53,591
Fifty.

285
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:54,624
Break.

286
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,290
Yeah,
that makes me pretty intense.

287
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:00,458
I just do stuff without thinking.

288
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,062
What's wrong?

289
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,297
I need to go home.
To my hometown.

290
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:08,566
Oh, that sounds cool.

291
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,868
No. It's not cool.

292
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,642
It's necessary.

293
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:13,976
Why?

294
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,111
Because of my mission.

295
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,508
It's time to put my training
into use.

296
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,981
What do you have to do?

297
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:21,378
Kill a man...

298
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:22,813
probably.

299
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:26,252
- Who?
- Eric Elisi.

300
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,482
He's Samoan.

301
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,054
Why? What did he do?

302
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:30,890
Nearly ruined my life,
that's all.

303
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,854
He's my high school Nemesis.

304
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:36,325
He's been living in Samoa,
but I just heard from my contact...

305
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:38,096
that he's gonna be coming home
soon.

306
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,304
When he gets back...

307
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:43,166
guess who's gonna be forming
the welcoming party?

308
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,474
- You?
- You got it, girl.

309
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,441
What exactly
are you gonna do to him?

310
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:51,948
I'm gonna kick his Samoan arse,
that's what.

311
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,812
It's time to pay the piper.

312
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:56,750
He's gonna reap what he sowed
and it sure ain't corn...

313
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,215
or wheat.

314
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,657
When are you going?

315
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,749
That's the fuckin' point.
I can't leave!

316
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,563
Sorry.

317
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,626
I told you, I just snap sometimes.
It's my depression.

318
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:10,759
Sorry.

319
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,600
- Why can't you leave?
- Because I don't have any wheels.

320
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,437
How the hell am I gonna get there
if I got no wheels?

321
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,778
- On a bus?
- I'm not gonna take a damn bus.

322
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:24,477
It'll take ages. I'll get there in,
like, two weeks or something.

323
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,981
- Why don't you hire a car?
- Okay. Sure.

324
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,986
Have you got, like,
a million dollars for me?

325
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,517
- What about Damon?
- Who?

326
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:35,850
My brother.

327
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,119
Oh, yeah, sorry.

328
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:39,129
He's got a car.
He's got a Ford Laser.

329
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:40,826
Shall I ask him?

330
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,226
Yeah.

331
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:47,963
Damon, would it be alright
if we borrowed your car...

332
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,098
to take Jarrod to his hometown?

333
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:51,904
Yes.

334
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,604
He said yes.

335
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:54,610
I heard.

336
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,438
Thanks, man.

337
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,547
You're cool.

338
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:50,866
Horse.

339
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,702
Damn.

340
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,732
I've got fourteen now,
you've only got eight.

341
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:55,898
You're too good.

342
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,569
How many have you got,
Jarrod?

343
00:27:58,576 --> 00:27:59,702
None.

344
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,808
- Horse.
- Damn.

345
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,743
Look, I don't even get it.

346
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:09,514
Just whenever you see a horse,
you say "horse".

347
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:12,420
And whoever in the end has
the most horses wins all the horses.

348
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,353
Well, no. Not so much really,
just like pretend.

349
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,759
Yeah well,
it's not even a real game.

350
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:23,193
I don't really want to play
this game anymore, Damon. It's dumb.

351
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,369
Hey, so.

352
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,960
What did the Samoan guy
do to you?

353
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,938
Damon,
that actually might be personal.

354
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,366
It's cool.

355
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:34,243
Him and some other guys from school
used to gang up on me.

356
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,674
I used to be a bit of a nerd.

357
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,242
Would've been okay one on one.
Even one on two...

358
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:45,016
me against two of them.
But, I'd usually have to fight, like...

359
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,816
eight of them.

360
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,623
That's awful.

361
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:52,624
Sometimes my brother would help out
and then we'd kick some serious ass.

362
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,728
But usually they'd find me
when I was alone...

363
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,633
and I'm like, " Oh okay,
now I have to fight eight of you.

364
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:01,729
Come on then, bring it on."
Anyway...

365
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,335
I don't really want to talk
about it.

366
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:10,813
Jarrod...

367
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,178
Get out of the car.

368
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,455
I need your clothes
and your boots and your motorcycle.

369
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,293
- Know who that is?
- Arnie.

370
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:27,357
- It's Arnie.
- He sounds just like him.

371
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:29,691
Hey, I bought some apples
for you guys.

372
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:30,835
Thanks.

373
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,502
I'll have one later.

374
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,807
Oh, yuk.

375
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:42,970
This is rotten.

376
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,877
Thanks very much
for trying to kill me, Damon.

377
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,733
So are you gonna introduce us?

378
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,173
- This is Nancy, my sister.
- Hi.

379
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:19,246
- This is Doug, her husband.
- Hi.

380
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:21,751
Ah, this is Dad. He's my Dad.

381
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,254
- This is my friend, Damon.
- Hello.

382
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,453
And this is Lily.

383
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:31,657
Lily's like, the best female
Fight Man player I have ever seen.

384
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:33,860
- And she's a dancer.
- Cool.

385
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:35,459
No, I'm not.

386
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,594
I thought you said that once.

387
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,200
I like your jackets and your pants.

388
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:46,602
Thanks. This is
our own label, "Awesome Apparel".

389
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:50,011
- It didn't really take off.
- Which actually makes these quite rare.

390
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:52,948
- Really?
- You wouldn't find these in any shops.

391
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:56,544
We've actually got some surplus stock
if you guys are keen... to buy anything.

392
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:57,755
Oh, yeah.

393
00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:59,516
- Are you keen?
- I am.

394
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:00,681
Yeah?

395
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,794
Dad.

396
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,995
I made you this.

397
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:20,042
Thanks, Jarrod.

398
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,345
So where are you guys going to sleep?
There's no room in the house.

399
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,675
- Oh, what about my room?
- Our surplus stock's in there.

400
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,911
- What about Gordon's room?
- Dad's in there.

401
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,886
- Well, who's in his room?
- Us.

402
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,916
- Who's in your room?
- Zane.

403
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,150
Yeah, Vinny's in here.

404
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,488
It's not fair.
Where am I supposed to sleep?

405
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,529
- Pitch the tent.
- I don't want to sleep in a damn tent.

406
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,164
This is typical.
No one ever thinks about me.

407
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,529
That's because you're a loser.

408
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,965
You're a loser. Bitch.

409
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:46,098
- Cock hole.
- Bitch.

410
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,194
- Cock hole.
- Bitch.

411
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:48,204
- Cock hole.
- Bitch.

412
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:50,798
- Cock hole.
- Stop calling me cock hole, bitch.

413
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:55,377
Cock hole.

414
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,411
You're a bitch.
And you're gonna die of diabetes.

415
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,685
I'm twenty-eight years old.

416
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,551
<i>Treat me like an adult, bitch.</i>

417
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,145
Hey wow. That's you.

418
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,278
What? Yes.

419
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,882
Wow.

420
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:34,848
That's so well done.

421
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,046
It's okay.
My brother did it.

422
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:41,821
- What's all that stuff?
- Stuff.

423
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:43,351
More candles?

424
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:46,425
Yes. Rejects.
Ones that aren't good enough.

425
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,129
Hey wow.

426
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,360
It's a hand.
And it's pointing up.

427
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:52,368
Give me that.

428
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,465
Who gave you permission
to touch that?

429
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:55,597
No-one. Sorry.

430
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:57,197
How would you like it
if I went over to your place...

431
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,004
and just started touching
everything?

432
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:02,012
Like your books and your oven,
or your computer.

433
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,446
How about I just started messing around
on your computer...

434
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:05,948
and changed all the settings.

435
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,144
Changed your bloody
desktop picture?

436
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,243
I said I was sorry.

437
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:16,689
This candle was supposed to be
for my Dad, but he thought it was dumb.

438
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,789
Well, I think it's cool.

439
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:20,189
It's a reject.

440
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,569
How did your brother die?

441
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:29,471
Sorry.

442
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,932
He was saving a kid
from a fire at the school.

443
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,338
Wow.

444
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,212
Well...

445
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,052
I'll be back in a week, right?

446
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:45,746
Yep.

447
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:47,988
You need anything you just...

448
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:50,326
- give me a call, okay?
- Yeah, okay. Yep.

449
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,928
Thanks, Damon.

450
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:55,432
Yep.

451
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,299
Oh, wait.

452
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,832
- Safety grass.
- Safety grass.

453
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,003
I'll be back.

454
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:08,704
See you later.

455
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,274
Cock hole.

456
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,076
See ya. Love ya.

457
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:53,389
Done.

458
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,864
I like your family.
Doug and Nancy are very nice.

459
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:04,297
They're idiots.
Except for my Dad and me.

460
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,538
- I like them.
- Yeah, well...

461
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,068
they're still idiots.

462
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,354
This is Mason Hutchinson.

463
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,419
He's the best computer hacker
I know.

464
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,122
Gidday, Mason.

465
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:35,290
This is Lily McKinnon.

466
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:37,857
She's the best female
Fight Man player I've ever seen.

467
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:39,664
Hi.

468
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:42,570
Down to business, Mason.
Any developments?

469
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:44,668
When's the bastard getting back?

470
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:18,337
Not today, but the next day.

471
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:21,142
Tomorrow?

472
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:23,280
Yeah.

473
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:27,208
Good work.
How did you find out this information?

474
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:30,045
I asked his mum.
She lives in his house.

475
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:31,153
Good.

476
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:32,880
I'm glad he'll have someone
to wipe his arse...

477
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:34,891
when I turn him into a vegetable.

478
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:45,395
You've got pornography
on your computer screen.

479
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,438
<i>Oh, Baby.</i>

480
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,003
<i>Oh, Baby.</i>

481
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,415
<i>Oh, Baby.</i>

482
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:00,875
<i>Oh, Baby.</i>

483
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,886
It's got a virus.

484
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:16,298
Lilies.

485
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:19,937
Go. Move.

486
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,510
Hi, Dad.

487
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,894
Hey, Zane.
You still playing guitar?

488
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,429
Yep, yep.

489
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,228
Me and Zane are in a band.

490
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:56,471
Wow.

491
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,371
He does the music and I dance.

492
00:37:58,709 --> 00:37:59,641
Cool.

493
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:03,177
Lily plays guitar too. She's really
good. She's good at finger picking.

494
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:04,612
- Really?
- No, not really.

495
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,309
Just, sort of, teaching myself.

496
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:09,751
- And she's got a degree.
- No, I don't.

497
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:12,580
Hey so,
what do you your parents do?

498
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,955
- They're dead unfortunately.
- They're dead.

499
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:17,750
Good one, Nancy.
They had heart attacks.

500
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,391
Sorry, Lily.

501
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,029
It doesn't matter.

502
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,893
She's an orphan.
Like Oliver Twist.

503
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,433
Well, I suppose
I should say a few words.

504
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,741
Why?

505
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,179
Now we're all here I'd just like to say
that I'm really happy...

506
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:40,684
that we're all together under the same
roof. It's always great to come home.

507
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,981
And I'd also like to say
that this Saturday...

508
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:46,785
I'll be having a scheduled fight
with Eric Elisi.

509
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:49,690
- He's Samoan.
- Oh, yeah. He used to beat you up.

510
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,751
- Yeah, and me.
- Yeah, and him.

511
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,161
He was the toughest guy
at our school.

512
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,929
He used to pick on quite a few people,
actually.

513
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,328
Anyway...

514
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:01,165
you're all invited to attend.
It'd be great to see you there.

515
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,495
Thank you.

516
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:05,407
Why are you fighting him, uncle?

517
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:10,244
Well, Zane... Basically, I'm gonna
restore honor to the family name...

518
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:11,747
to your family name.

519
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,841
My family name is Davis.
Eh, Dad?

520
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:16,512
Yep.
Dangerous Davis back in the day.

521
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:19,488
- Yeah, I'm a Davis too.
- Yeah, well it doesn't matter, does it?

522
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,021
We're family.

523
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:23,323
That's what matters.

524
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:32,798
Why didn't you tell me
you had a little girl?

525
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:34,763
I don't know.

526
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,274
- How often do you see her?
- Not very.

527
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,471
- How old is she?
- Nine.

528
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,146
- Were you married?
- No.

529
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,345
What is this Crimewatch?

530
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:50,043
We met at a party, we had sex,
then a baby came out.

531
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,645
End of story. Finito.

532
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,556
How many boyfriends have you had?

533
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,592
Three.

534
00:39:58,362 --> 00:39:59,294
Who?

535
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:03,094
Sam, Sam, another Sam,
and Raymond.

536
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,228
How many girlfriends
have you had?

537
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,168
About five.

538
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:12,434
Actually, eight.

539
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,738
I forgot some.

540
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:15,477
Who?

541
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,279
That's irrelevant.

542
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:35,093
- <i>Lily.</i>
- <i>Yep.</i>

543
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:38,826
<i>You can hold my hand if you want.</i>

544
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,266
<i>Okay.</i>

545
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,122
Good morning.

546
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,287
- Morning.
- Hi.

547
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,892
Hey.

548
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,387
Look at all this stuff.

549
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,654
How much do you reckon you'd pay...

550
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:11,061
for all this make-up?
A bag, like this?

551
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,460
Dunno. Maybe a hundred bucks?

552
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,301
No.
All this is only thirty dollars.

553
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:21,343
And,
it's dermatologically sweet as.

554
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,403
- Yep. But you can have it for twenty.
- Cool.

555
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,379
Five.

556
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,174
- Twenty-five dollars...
- Twenty-five.

557
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,444
Because you're a guest.

558
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,552
Combination.

559
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,790
Kick, punch, block,
spin, double kick.

560
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:38,091
Kick, spin...

561
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:39,823
kick, punch...

562
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,256
double kick.

563
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,395
Okay, ball.
Block.

564
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,229
Stick, block.
Block.

565
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:46,835
Hoop.

566
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:49,335
Through, yes!

567
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:51,606
Hi.

568
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:52,733
- Hey, Trace.
- Hi, Tracy.

569
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,141
Hey, Trace-meister.

570
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:55,470
Hey, let's take a break.

571
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:56,704
Good work everyone.

572
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:58,975
Who's that?

573
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:02,085
That's Tracy.
Their dead brother's fiancée,e.

574
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:04,177
- Hey, this is Lily.
- Gidday.

575
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:05,854
Hi.

576
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,847
She's good at sports.

577
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:10,417
Netball, darts...

578
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:13,156
- Here, Jonah, here's that tape.
- Oh, thank you, Trace.

579
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,290
Hey, Trace-meister.
I heard you made team captain.

580
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,528
Yeah, Naomi got run over
in the weekend. So, they...

581
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:20,069
- yeah...
- Oh, that's wonderful news.

582
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:22,264
- I'm so proud of you, Trace.
- Oh, thanks.

583
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:24,304
Hey, Lily.
Show them your hula hooping.

584
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,303
Oh, no.
I'm not really that good.

585
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,538
Yes, you are.
She is good.

586
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,614
Show them. Go on.

587
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:32,040
They want to see it.

588
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,214
Why'd you drop it?

589
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:43,418
Sorry.

590
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,035
Dad, what do you think
of my new girlfriend?

591
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:04,575
She's an artist and a musician.
Amongst other things.

592
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,147
She's pretty cool, eh?

593
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:07,409
I don't know.

594
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,178
Yeah.

595
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:22,556
- Hey, what's good to buy for girls?
- Socks.

596
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,932
- I don't know.
- Vitamins.

597
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:26,463
Flowers, eh?

598
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:29,166
- Chicks like flowers.
- Yes.

599
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:30,765
What kind?

600
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:32,635
I don't mind.

601
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:36,840
Doesn't matter.
Chicks, they just like flowers.

602
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,500
Chilly.

603
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:12,108
I have to dump you.

604
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:16,543
Okay.

605
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,853
My life's just too complicated.

606
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:23,025
I guess, what I'm saying is...

607
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,491
I gotta be alone right now.

608
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:26,687
Oh, yeah.

609
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:29,662
And I'm busy
with the revenge mission.

610
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:32,864
I'm sorry.

611
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,265
- I didn't know this would happen.
- Oh, it doesn't matter.

612
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,368
And we can still be friends,
right?

613
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,336
Yep.

614
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:48,943
Damn it.

615
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:51,784
I'm too complex.

616
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:09,464
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>This is Bond, James Bond.</i>

617
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,065
<i>I'm away on a mission</i>
<i>for Her Majesty's Secret Service.</i>

618
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:14,508
<i>Please, leave a message.</i>
<i>Shaken not stirred.</i>

619
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,237
Hi, Damon. It's Lily.

620
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:19,908
I might have to come back
a little bit early.

621
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:25,080
So do you mind giving me a call,
please, on 8153373?

622
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:26,144
Thanks, bye.

623
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,859
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>This is Bond, James Bond.</i>

624
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:40,665
<i>I'm away on a mission</i>

Hey, bitch.

626
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:58,146
<i>Hello. Who's this?</i>

627
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:00,618
Oh, sorry.
Hi, is Eric there please?

628
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:02,352
<i>No, he's not back</i>
<i>till later tonight.</i>

629
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:05,290
<i>We go to the airport.</i>
<i>We've got a mini-van. You wanna come?</i>

630
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:08,455
No, thanks. It's okay.

631
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:10,523
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>You wanna leave a message for him?</i>

632
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:13,260
Yes.

633
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:17,733
Could you tell him that
justice is waiting for him?

634
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:22,635
<i>Is waiting for you. Okay, Justin.</i>
<i>Thank you. Bye-bye.</i>

635
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:23,702
No, justice.

636
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:28,075
Justice.

637
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:40,357
- Hey, Tracy.
- Hi.

638
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:41,788
Can I come in?

639
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:43,533
Yeah.

640
00:46:57,748 --> 00:47:00,182
There's no buses today.
They only go on Sunday's.

641
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,981
That's like
three whole days away.

642
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:07,918
I heard you broke up with Jarrod.

643
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,353
No. He broke up with me.

644
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:11,559
Did he?

645
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:20,597
Would...
do you wanna go out with me?

646
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,000
No, thanks.

647
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:27,876
Yeah well, I wasn't even serious.

648
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:35,316
I was...
I was joking and you fell for it, so...

649
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:38,121
I was joking...

650
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:40,782
I was joking.

651
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:44,216
Just joking.

652
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:46,722
You fell for it.

653
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:52,928
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>This is Bond, James Bond.</i>

654
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:55,471
<i>I'm away on a mission</i>
<i>for Her Majesty's Secret Service.</i>

655
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:58,675
Fuck it.

656
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:16,724
Hi.

657
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:47,952
- I don't want to go up there.
- What?

658
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:50,255
I don't want to go up there.
Take me home, please.

659
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,954
Take me home, please.

660
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:56,697
I don't want to go up there.

661
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,034
That's where my Uncle Gordon died.

662
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:34,734
I thought he died in a fire.

663
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:35,794
Na.

664
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:43,906
I need to go to the toilet.

665
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,575
Come on then.

666
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:50,175
Come on.

667
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:13,633
There's my Dad.

668
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:26,480
Ouch.

669
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:32,314
Have you checked out
our local social scene yet?

670
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:34,641
Yeah, oh, not really.

671
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:38,648
Well, we're going to a party tomorrow
night. You can come if you want.

672
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:41,289
- Thanks, but I'm trying to go home.
- You sure?

673
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:42,290
Yeah.

674
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,404
Does anybody want to hear a joke?

675
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:56,904
Yeah.

676
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:03,437
What's the name
of the Emperor of Farts?

677
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:07,548
What?

678
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:09,678
Gaseous Maximus.

679
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:27,296
What's so funny?

680
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:30,706
- Oh, Lily just told a funny joke.
- Yeah. Where have you been?

681
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:32,835
Just hanging out with Tracy.

682
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,738
We've been pretty much laughing
the whole day.

683
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:37,006
Like this,
but about ten times more laughing.

684
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:39,078
Wow. That's heaps.

685
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:43,076
Excuse me.
Thank you for that very lovely dinner.

686
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:49,018
Excuse me. Thank you.

687
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:58,827
<i>Gordon. Gordon. Gordon. Gordon.</i>

688
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:14,109
<i>Get out of it.</i>

689
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:20,118
Dad, me and Tracy are going out.

690
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:23,582
I don't know how it happened,
but...

691
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:26,522
It's pretty serious.

692
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:35,003
Just thought you should know
the good news.

693
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:17,943
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. I'm asleep.

694
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,010
- Why don't you go sleep in the tent?
- Ah, I'm alright.

695
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:26,217
You go in the tent.
I'll sleep out here.

696
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:27,483
No, you go.

697
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:29,219
You go. You're the lady.

698
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:32,723
I can handle it.
I've got my sleeping bag. I'm good.

699
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:38,300
You don't complain about anything,
do you?

700
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:41,460
Well, there's some people in the world
who don't even have sleeping bags.

701
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,149
There's a weird smell down there.

702
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:56,779
I don't like it.

703
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:59,485
Think it's probably
a dead hedgehog or something.

704
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:01,551
Disgusting.

705
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:06,453
If you get cold,
you can come sleep in my tent.

706
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:09,293
But please, don't wake me up.

707
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:11,466
It's the last thing I need.

708
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,239
<i>You seem to be getting on</i>
<i>pretty well with my family.</i>

709
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:29,508
I told you, I like them.

710
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,678
<i>Yeah, well...</i>

711
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:34,223
<i>don't get too close.</i>
<i>They'll turn on you, that's for sure.</i>

712
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:41,288
<i>What was that joke</i>
<i>you told them?</i>

713
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:44,064
Just my favorite.

714
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:46,231
One of Damon's.

715
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,305
Can you tell it to me?

716
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:54,004
No.

717
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:14,159
- Oh, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

718
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:33,406
You sucker, you better watch out.
You fool.

719
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:36,583
Yeah, hey fool. Hey fool.

720
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:40,581
Sucker.
You foolish, foolish sucker.

721
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:43,617
- Better wa...
- <i>Hello.</i>

722
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:45,456
- Hello, is Eric there, please?
- <i>Speaking.</i>

723
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:47,024
Hey sucker.

724
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,197
<i>Who is this?</i>

725
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:51,867
This is the piper.
And I want to be pied.

726
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:54,199
Paid. Paid.

727
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:55,302
<i>Who's this?</i>

728
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:57,236
- It's Jarrod.
- <i>Who?</i>

729
00:57:57,373 --> 00:57:58,806
- Lough.
- <i>Who?</i>

730
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:00,843
Jarrod Lough.
We went to school together.

731
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,673
- <i>Did we?</i>
- Yes.

732
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:05,111
- I assume you got my letter.
- <i>No. What letter?</i>

733
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:06,512
Invitation.

734
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:07,982
- <i>To a party?</i>
- To a fight.

735
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:09,746
- <i>What fight?</i>
- Our fight.

736
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,080
<i>Hold on. Hold on.</i>

737
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:15,188
<i>Alison!</i>
<i>Is there any mail for me?</i>

738
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:19,986
<i>Oh, yeah. There's something here.</i>
<i>It's a letter. Should I open it?</i>

739
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:22,657
Yes. I'll call you back.
It's long.

740
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:37,435
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hi, it's Jarrod.

741
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,448
- <i>Oh, hey there, man.</i>
- Did you read it?

742
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:44,317
- <i>Yeah, look man. I'm sorry, you know...</i>
- You will be sorry. You will be.

743
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:48,323
Meet me, 3 pm at the school playground.
We're gonna have a fight.

744
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:50,757
- <i>Now look, I...</i>
- No you look and listen.

745
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:54,955
You better be on that playground
on Saturday.

746
00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:57,963
I'm gonna be there
ready to fight you.

747
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,730
And if you don't turn up,
everyone's gonna know you're a pussy.

748
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:03,601
- Because I'm gonna tell them, fool.
- <i>Alright. I'll be there.</i>

749
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:04,605
- Okay.
- <i>Yep.</i>

750
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:05,834
- Good.
- <i>Alright.</i>

751
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:08,605
That's all. See you later.

752
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:19,573
You're going too fast.

753
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:24,018
Jarrod!

754
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:28,691
Jarrod!
Are you alright?

755
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:30,225
Help me up.
Get this bike off me.

756
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:32,016
What happened?

757
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:35,464
I had an accident.
Some chick in a Trans Am.

758
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:36,725
Reckless bitch.

759
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:42,671
- What are you guys up to?
- Nothing. Walking.

760
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:43,728
Oh, yeah.

761
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:48,175
Dad, do you want to come with me?
We could hang out and train.

762
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:50,303
Lily and I are doing something.

763
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,275
Okay, cool.

764
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:00,015
Well,
I'll see you guys later then.

765
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:02,417
Have a good day.

766
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:10,460
Who does he think he is?

767
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:12,667
You were right to break up
with him.

768
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:15,804
No, I didn't break up with him.
He broke up with me.

769
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:18,807
Oh well, you would've.
Given time.

770
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,712
- Take me away from here.
- Where?

771
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:28,376
Anywhere.
Help me escape.

772
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:31,178
Okay.
Where shall we go?

773
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,878
Where do you wanna go?

774
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:36,990
Home.
I wanna go home.

775
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:40,026
Oh, home's horrible.
You must wanna go somewhere else.

776
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,094
Dunno. Be Australia.

777
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:48,103
Na, not there.
My ex-wife lives there.

778
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:50,995
What? Is she alive?

779
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,970
Who cares about her?
She's a lesbian.

780
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:30,510
Okay, don't put the blade out.

781
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:33,448
Wow!

782
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:35,741
- Wow.
- Stop the press.

783
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:37,809
- We've got a fashion model in the house.
- Yeah.

784
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:39,650
- Is that the makeup you got from us?
- Yep.

785
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:41,790
- And your skin's alright?
- Yep.

786
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:43,087
Why?

787
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:45,024
- We were just wondering.
- Oh, nothing.

788
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:49,055
I was wondering if perhaps I could
potentially still come to that party?

789
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:50,130
Sure.

790
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:51,298
Thank you.

791
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:54,260
Is this sort of appropriate?

792
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:56,264
I just don't really have
any sort of party gears.

793
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:19,318
- Lily!
- Lily!

794
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:20,719
- Lily!
- Lily!

795
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,223
- Lily!
- Lily!

796
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:23,622
- Lily!
- Lily!

797
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,126
- Lily!
- Lily!

798
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:26,525
- Lily!
- Lily!

799
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:28,029
- Lily!
- Lily!

800
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:29,462
- Lily!
- Lily!

801
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:30,999
- Lily!
- Lily!

802
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:32,364
- Lily!
- Lily!

803
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,077
- Lily!
- Lily!

804
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:50,345
- Lily!
- Lily!

805
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:52,785
- Lily!
- Lily!

806
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:55,085
- Lily!
- Lily!

807
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:57,557
- Lily!
- Lily!

808
01:04:57,627 --> 01:04:59,925
- Lily!
- Lily!

809
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:02,294
- Lily!
- Lily!

810
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,605
Did you have a nice time
fucking my friend Mason Hutchinson?

811
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:51,078
What?

812
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:53,945
Did you have a nice time
fucking my friend Mason Hutchinson?

813
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:55,916
Or did you do everyone
at the whole party?

814
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:57,282
I didn't do anyone.

815
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:01,185
Anyway what do you care?
You've got Tracy.

816
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:03,487
We're not even going out.
We haven't even kissed.

817
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:06,751
Could've if I wanted to,
but I've been too busy training.

818
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:09,497
Where did you sleep last night?

819
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:11,527
In the bushes.

820
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,763
Great. Meanwhile, I'm up all night
wondering where the hell you are.

821
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:17,533
I thought you were dead. You could've
left me a note or something.

822
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:20,507
It's easy, " Dear Jarrod,
don't wait up all night long.

823
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:22,669
I'll be sleeping in the bushes.
Thank you".

824
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:25,475
I didn't get any sleep last night
and you know it's my big day.

825
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:26,946
What am I going to tell
your brother?

826
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:29,849
"Oh, yeah. Hi, Damon,
your sister, Lily...

827
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:33,286
Na... Oh, she went to a party
and got killed.

828
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:37,088
Here's a bit of her leg,
that's all that's left.

829
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,227
You should be more careful
next time...

830
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:41,126
because I'm not gonna be there
to wait up for you.

831
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:44,132
Gotta go.

832
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,392
- Are you ready for your fight?
- Yes.

833
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:48,465
I'm gonna cut his damn head off.

834
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:51,104
Not that you'll be there.

835
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:53,801
You'll probably be off
having sex with heaps of people.

836
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:57,368
I'll think about it.

837
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:15,155
Can you remind my dad to come?
Because he might forget.

838
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,360
<i>Hi, this is Michael Jackson.</i>

839
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:24,065
- Damon, it's Lily.
- <i>Lily.</i>

840
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:25,402
I tried to call.

841
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:26,964
<i>How's it going down there?</i>

842
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,237
It's been pretty weird.

843
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:30,969
Do you want to come home?
I can come and get you if you like.

844
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,345
Oh, no, no. It's too far.
I'll just catch a bus.

845
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:35,846
You sure?
I can leave right now.

846
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:38,386
Yeah, no, no. It goes tomorrow.
I'll be home in time for tea.

847
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:40,415
I'll make your favorite...

848
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:42,281
Shepherd's Pie?

849
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:43,416
Oh, yum.

850
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:44,793
<i>You gonna be okay?</i>

851
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:47,124
Yeah. It's just really nice
to hear your voice.

852
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,425
Okay.
Well, I'm right here, okay?

853
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:51,329
- Yeah, I know.
- <i>Well...</i>

854
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:55,063
You have a shaggadelic day baby,
yeah!

855
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,638
- <i>Do behave.</i>
- Yeah. Bye.

856
01:07:57,706 --> 01:07:58,866
<i>Bye.</i>

857
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:18,523
Gordon jumped off that.

858
01:08:20,296 --> 01:08:23,788
Look at it, sticking up there
like a bloody tombstone.

859
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:30,237
It was so wonderful when he won.
I just wanted...

860
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:34,402
him to keep on doing better,
you know, to keep winning.

861
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:40,275
Maybe that's why he did it,
because of me.

862
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:43,575
I'll never know now.

863
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:48,653
My whole life
is a complete disaster.

864
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:52,818
You know...

865
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:54,889
life is...

866
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:57,893
full of hard bits, I think.
But...

867
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:00,762
in between the hard bits
are some...

868
01:09:00,836 --> 01:09:02,497
really lovely bits.

869
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:05,803
I mean, Jarrod's a lovely bit.

870
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,068
Jarrod?

871
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:09,434
Yep.

872
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:11,404
Jarrod?

873
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:12,569
Yeah.

874
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:15,640
- I just don't think you know him.
- Yes, I do. I know my family.

875
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:17,083
Better than you do.

876
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,218
Oh, what's Jarrod's
favorite animal then?

877
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:22,322
- A giraffe.
- No.

878
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,219
- An octopus.
- No.

879
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:29,355
- Well, a cheetah then.
- No.

880
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:31,790
It's an eagle.

881
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,502
Okay.

882
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:40,965
Or a cobra.

883
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:13,369
- Good luck, Eagle.
- What?

884
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:15,400
Eagle.

885
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:17,105
I know.

886
01:10:32,795 --> 01:10:33,727
There he is.

887
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:43,999
Kick his arse!

888
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:53,207
Is this a trick?

889
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:55,513
No, it's not a trick.

890
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:56,950
Mason?

891
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:00,484
Mason? Is it? Is he tricking?

892
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,827
- Can you move?
- Yeah.

893
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:10,226
- Your legs.
- No.

894
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:12,499
- Can you feel anything in them?
- No.

895
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,242
Fuck off.

896
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:22,239
- You felt it.
- No, I didn't.

897
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:23,969
- Well, did you feel it or what?
- No.

898
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:25,411
- You screamed.
- Of course I screamed.

899
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:27,142
You hit me with fuckin' nunchucks!

900
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:32,083
- You're a cripple.
- Yeah.

901
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:35,249
He's a cripple...

902
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:39,188
I don't fuckin' believe it.

903
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:41,994
Mason. Why didn't you tell me?

904
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:45,126
- I did, kind of.
- No, you didn't.

905
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:47,332
Yeah, on the phone,
before I came here.

906
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:50,270
You said, "when I'm finished with him
he won't be able to walk".

907
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:51,636
And then I laughed.

908
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,809
- Is that what you meant?
- Yeah.

909
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:03,215
But I've been training.

910
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:05,783
I was gonna kick your arse.

911
01:12:06,288 --> 01:12:08,347
- When did it happen?
- About a year ago.

912
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:10,286
- How?
- Accident.

913
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:12,016
What kind? Car accident?

914
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:14,257
- No.
- What kind? How did it happen?

915
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,924
- I was skiing in Aspen...
- Oh, shut up. I don't want to know.

916
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,899
- Listen...
- Shut up. I'm trying to think.

917
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:20,360
I'm sorry.

918
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:22,168
What?

919
01:12:22,538 --> 01:12:24,403
- What did you say?
- Sorry.

920
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:29,074
For all the things I did.
For picking on you at school.

921
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:31,610
For... Jesus.
It was such a long time ago.

922
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:36,017
- I'm sorry.
- You ruined my life.

923
01:13:36,278 --> 01:13:37,506
Jarrod!

924
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:40,475
I'll get you.

925
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:44,345
Jarrod! Cut it out.

926
01:13:51,193 --> 01:13:53,127
Come here.

927
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:09,704
Leave him. He's had enough.

928
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:06,859
Hello.

929
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:16,938
- How's it going?
- Fucking terrible.

930
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,582
Stop following me.

931
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:29,613
<i>Let's dance</i>

932
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:33,821
<i>Put on your red shoes</i>
<i>And do the blues</i>

933
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:35,462
<i>Let's dance</i>

934
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:39,092
<i>To the song playing on the radio</i>

935
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:40,926
<i>Let's dance</i>

936
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:44,336
<i>Put on your red shoes</i>
<i>And do the blues</i>

937
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:45,896
Dance the blues.

938
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:49,710
It's "dance the blues",
not "do the blues".

939
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:55,743
<i>Let's dance</i>

940
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:59,981
<i>Put on your red shoes</i>
<i>And do the blues</i>

941
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:34,152
You're still watching me,
aren't you?

942
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:36,281
Yep.

943
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:38,658
Why don't you go away?

944
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:42,161
I don't want to.

945
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:45,030
Why?

946
01:16:48,704 --> 01:16:49,966
I mean, what a loser.

947
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:52,564
Yep.

948
01:16:57,913 --> 01:17:00,473
Why are you hanging around me?
You loser.

949
01:17:04,987 --> 01:17:06,249
It's not worth it.

950
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:10,990
Yeah, it is.

951
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:44,284
Do you know
we've got the same mole?

952
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:48,818
What mole?

953
01:17:49,364 --> 01:17:50,331
This one.

954
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:52,657
See?

955
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:08,478
I'm a loser. Aren't I?

956
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:14,879
It doesn't matter.

957
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:44,818
I have two things to say.

958
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:48,121
One...

959
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:50,758
I'm leaving tomorrow on a bus.

960
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:52,984
Two...

961
01:18:54,196 --> 01:18:55,686
That could change.

962
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,186
Hey, Dangerous Person.

963
01:20:44,472 --> 01:20:46,337
- Lilies.
- Oh, yeah.

964
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:48,342
Wow.

965
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:26,412
