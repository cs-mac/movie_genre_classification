1
00:00:10,154 --> 00:00:12,084
Ja Hyeon.
<i>Episode 17</i>

2
00:00:13,394 --> 00:00:15,324
Mother.

3
00:00:46,854 --> 00:00:48,704
Who is it?

4
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:53,804
Look over here.

5
00:00:58,084 --> 00:01:00,884
Are you the people who have aided Ja Hyeon?

6
00:01:02,494 --> 00:01:04,483
I'm her older brother, Seong Deuk Shik.

7
00:01:04,484 --> 00:01:07,074
How should I repay this debt?

8
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:21,264
G-g-g-grand prince!

9
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:34,044
It might be better for the two of you
to move far away and live together.

10
00:01:35,024 --> 00:01:37,743
It's dangerous in Do Seong, head east.

11
00:01:37,744 --> 00:01:44,323
Mother. I want to make your
daughter an unquestionable bride.

12
00:01:44,324 --> 00:01:47,403
I can't make her live her
whole life being pursued.

13
00:01:47,404 --> 00:01:53,353
But you can't continue to live
your life this way at the temple.

14
00:01:53,354 --> 00:01:57,803
If we have love in our hearts, even if
we're apart, we are not truly apart.

15
00:01:57,804 --> 00:02:02,744
I found out through your daughter, that
not even death could pull us apart.

16
00:02:03,714 --> 00:02:07,653
Because I've made her go through so many difficulties,
I thought that maybe we shouldn't have met.

17
00:02:07,654 --> 00:02:13,154
I thought that I should let her
go, and regretted this all once.

18
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:16,873
But, bidding her farewell
was even more difficult.

19
00:02:16,874 --> 00:02:22,223
Born into privilege. The kind of hardship
you've been in is unseen and unheard of.

20
00:02:22,224 --> 00:02:27,923
Because I've gone through hardship, I've
come to realize what's really precious.

21
00:02:27,924 --> 00:02:32,663
Anger has helped me to think in more depth.

22
00:02:32,664 --> 00:02:36,974
One difficult situation can
cut right to the bone.

23
00:02:37,964 --> 00:02:41,733
If I had lived an uneventful life, I
wouldn't have known these things.

24
00:02:41,734 --> 00:02:46,073
How life is so precious.

25
00:02:46,074 --> 00:02:50,004
How much I love this person.

26
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:56,913
In my eyes, it's okay not
to realize these things.

27
00:02:56,914 --> 00:02:59,743
I want you to live with
my daughter happily.

28
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:04,253
I wanted you to live a
life full of laughter.

29
00:03:04,254 --> 00:03:12,074
Mother. I'm happy even now.

30
00:03:27,244 --> 00:03:28,623
This makes no sense.

31
00:03:28,624 --> 00:03:31,593
If he's going to die, why doesn't he die alone?
Why does he keep bringing Ja Hyeon into this?!

32
00:03:31,594 --> 00:03:36,053
Then. If she keeps living
here and dies old and alone.

33
00:03:36,054 --> 00:03:39,163
Is that good fate?

34
00:03:39,164 --> 00:03:41,743
That Ja Hyeon is nothing but trouble!

35
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:44,523
It would've been great if she had just peacefully become
a concubine last time when she went to the palace!

36
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,543
Ah, just be quiet!

37
00:03:46,544 --> 00:03:48,413
If they hear you it'll be bad news!

38
00:03:48,414 --> 00:03:52,543
Ah really. How can you not know
your sister? You live with her!

39
00:03:52,544 --> 00:03:55,523
Without the grand prince,
Ja Hyeon will die!

40
00:03:55,524 --> 00:03:59,864
She can't live with anyone else!
Ah, really.

41
00:04:04,174 --> 00:04:07,764
People give up on aspirations
as they live on.

42
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:12,833
Are there people who don't have a heart?
Are there people who don't like others?

43
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:17,264
Because of this and that reason, they just
give up knowing nothing will come of it.

44
00:04:18,434 --> 00:04:23,213
A fiery love that transcends death,

45
00:04:23,214 --> 00:04:25,913
How would you understand it?

46
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:27,943
Hey, I've been hurt more than you know.

47
00:04:27,944 --> 00:04:30,123
Yeah, you're hurt.

48
00:04:30,124 --> 00:04:33,374
Because you're hurt, you
can't summon up the courage.

49
00:04:35,414 --> 00:04:39,954
If I summon the courage,
would you even accept me?

50
00:04:42,094 --> 00:04:44,113
Does our blood lines disappear?

51
00:04:44,114 --> 00:04:49,884
I could be like Mother and Father. I could be a
great lover like Ja Hyeon and the Grand Prince too.

52
00:05:06,304 --> 00:05:10,653
Ah, it's scorched rice! It looks
so delicious. So delicious!

53
00:05:10,654 --> 00:05:13,103
Because we're at the temple, there's
nothing else I can give you.

54
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,743
Open up.

55
00:05:14,744 --> 00:05:17,363
It's really delicious.

56
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:19,394
Delicious.

57
00:05:26,524 --> 00:05:29,543
Our Roo Si Gae has really
improved her speaking skills.

58
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:34,474
But still has zero sense.
Right? Roo Si Gae.

59
00:05:43,264 --> 00:05:46,163
- Didn't the envoys from your country come here and go through some things?
- My homeland?

60
00:05:46,164 --> 00:05:53,273
Envoys were sent here from Jurchen,
but our king cut off their heads.

61
00:05:53,274 --> 00:05:55,463
Even if they're from Jurchen,

62
00:05:55,464 --> 00:05:58,833
is it okay to just kill
envoys from other countries?

63
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:00,923
It shouldn't. That's why it's a big mess.

64
00:06:00,924 --> 00:06:02,914
Oh my.

65
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:12,093
<i>Northern Pyunggwan (Jurchen Envoys' Stay)</i>

66
00:06:12,094 --> 00:06:14,274
We're here from Byeongbu.

67
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,304
Open the door!

68
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:39,323
Was it not enough to
kill the senior envoy?!

69
00:06:39,324 --> 00:06:42,764
How dare you enter the envoys' stay
and go through our possessions?!

70
00:06:44,374 --> 00:06:48,284
Would you like to lay
down your life as well?

71
00:06:55,034 --> 00:06:58,063
Make sure to collect everything
that appears to be a document!

72
00:06:58,064 --> 00:06:59,764
Yes!

73
00:07:01,814 --> 00:07:04,853
Are you in your right mind?
Even if they're foreigners.

74
00:07:04,854 --> 00:07:09,394
They're envoys we have officially
recognized. This shouldn't be happening!

75
00:07:10,754 --> 00:07:14,263
There as an instance when Goryeo's Ming
Nation's envoy Chae Bin was assassinated.

76
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:18,213
But that was ordered by those beneath
the king, not by the king himself!

77
00:07:18,214 --> 00:07:20,993
I granted your wish Mother.

78
00:07:20,994 --> 00:07:26,033
When you thought the missing Eun
Sung was thought to be dead.

79
00:07:26,034 --> 00:07:29,234
Didn't you say you would
most definitely get revenge?

80
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:35,853
Since I have killed the envoy, they will
now be aware of Joseon's fiery anger.

81
00:07:35,854 --> 00:07:39,173
If necessary, punishment
will also be given.

82
00:07:39,174 --> 00:07:44,513
Why are you doing this now? What is the reason for
your revenge after Eun Sung has been declared dead?

83
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:47,713
They think that superior Joseon is
merely the land of the brothers.

84
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:52,023
Because they dare to think my position
on Joseon's throne is laughable.

85
00:07:52,024 --> 00:07:55,823
Is that also the reason why
you overthrew your uncle?

86
00:07:55,824 --> 00:08:02,313
My uncle... Wasn't he also impatient and
tried to separate me from the others?

87
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:09,213
I asked him to be the Prime Minister because we were in a state of
emergency but royal relatives shouldn't hold official positions.

88
00:08:09,214 --> 00:08:10,763
I told him to lay low for now.

89
00:08:10,764 --> 00:08:14,323
Think before you act, and think once
more before you establish your commands.

90
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:18,133
State affairs must be taken care of
by cooperating with the royal court.

91
00:08:18,134 --> 00:08:23,853
With the subjects interfering, this nation's
affairs have never been able to run smoothly.

92
00:08:23,854 --> 00:08:29,194
I don't desire to make this the
subjects' nation, but a king's nation.

93
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:35,723
With strong authoritarian responsibility placed on the king in its
background, I want to strengthen the monarchy of this nation.

94
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,943
Do you understand how one person's
tyranny can ruin the people

95
00:08:38,944 --> 00:08:42,524
and turn history around??

96
00:08:43,684 --> 00:08:46,784
Please open your ears
and control your heart!

97
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:17,533
The Huli people don't seem to
have brought the document.

98
00:09:17,534 --> 00:09:21,263
We searched everywhere, but
couldn't find anything.

99
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:24,953
We never made a deal.

100
00:09:24,954 --> 00:09:28,323
Rumors can't be spread to the public.

101
00:09:28,324 --> 00:09:33,063
If the Jurchens reveal that
an envoy was killed...

102
00:09:33,064 --> 00:09:34,623
That's what I want.

103
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:39,294
Because if they provoke me, I can
crush them all the more clearly.

104
00:09:49,794 --> 00:09:55,213
Send an order to the north. Start
moving the soldiers to Pajeo River

105
00:09:55,214 --> 00:09:58,033
and have them be completely prepared just
in case there is a provocation attack.

106
00:09:58,034 --> 00:10:00,184
As you wish, Your Highness.

107
00:10:22,584 --> 00:10:24,753
We found the lady.

108
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:26,733
She was on the mountain
that she used to visit.

109
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:30,183
She was meeting her family, so
I could only confirm it today.

110
00:10:30,184 --> 00:10:33,773
Should we move her to a secret house? The conditions
aren't right for her to be moved to the palace...

111
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:35,513
Who took her?

112
00:10:35,514 --> 00:10:40,183
We left spies around, but we
don't know who the enemy is yet.

113
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:43,113
I withdrew quietly lest she
should run away again.

114
00:10:43,114 --> 00:10:45,644
Since we can't bring her here...

115
00:10:47,244 --> 00:10:49,684
I will go.

116
00:11:02,974 --> 00:11:04,333
Let us investigate the envoys.

117
00:11:04,334 --> 00:11:06,953
The Ministry of War has already
obtained information and left.

118
00:11:06,954 --> 00:11:10,324
We have few more things to
interrogate, so please open the gate.

119
00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:18,514
Open the gate.

120
00:11:25,774 --> 00:11:28,353
<i>We won't be fooled by
people of Josen anymore.</i>

121
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:32,673
<i>War is the only way. Go back!</i>

122
00:11:32,674 --> 00:11:34,504
He says "get lost."

123
00:11:36,454 --> 00:11:39,823
What do you gain by waging war?

124
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,703
If you run out of rations,

125
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:46,814
you will exchange the lives of
the soldiers for grain, right?

126
00:11:48,984 --> 00:11:50,423
Are you mocking us?

127
00:11:50,424 --> 00:11:53,813
I am giving you a chance.

128
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:58,143
You sided with Price Jin Yang
and created a war on purpose,

129
00:11:58,144 --> 00:12:01,334
and tried to kill me, the
prince of this country.

130
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:07,073
I nearly escaped death, yet I
am willing to forgive you.

131
00:12:07,074 --> 00:12:11,013
And I'm offering a chance
for us to become allies.

132
00:12:11,014 --> 00:12:14,923
I won't make false promises like Grand Prince Jin Yang when
he didn't stick what he said when he promised you territory.

133
00:12:14,924 --> 00:12:18,853
Instead, I will send Jeoson's technicians.

134
00:12:18,854 --> 00:12:22,883
And have them teach you agricultural
techniques to cultivate your barren land.

135
00:12:22,884 --> 00:12:26,593
We will resume your previously
blocked trade and through marriage,

136
00:12:26,594 --> 00:12:29,704
I will find a way for both nations to live.

137
00:12:31,774 --> 00:12:36,883
Make a choice. Will you return and
be investigated by your chief?

138
00:12:36,884 --> 00:12:42,774
Or will you choose these new negotiations and
have the opportunity to revive your hometown?

139
00:12:47,484 --> 00:12:49,673
You can trust Prince Eun Seong.

140
00:12:49,674 --> 00:12:53,564
He's someone who guarded me with his life
even though I am from an enemy clan.

141
00:12:57,294 --> 00:13:02,514
If you allow me to follow the envoy, I
will meet my father and get the documents.

142
00:13:30,764 --> 00:13:33,073
A present for you.

143
00:13:33,074 --> 00:13:34,904
He says it's a present for you.

144
00:13:35,894 --> 00:13:40,334
I wish to give you a
present before I leave.

145
00:13:43,954 --> 00:13:49,193
When we fight, we play the flute.

146
00:13:49,194 --> 00:13:53,483
Father has told him to play the flute,

147
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:58,644
if Prince Jin Yang doesn't
keep his promise.

148
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,823
<i>Letter of response from Grand Prince Jin Yang to Jurchen's Huligai Tribe,
Chieftain Li Man Zhu: Immediately, from the battlefield we will retreat to Joseon</i>

149
00:14:36,824 --> 00:14:42,384
<i>and Gen. Choe Yun Deok will return the four sovereign counties to you
in return for your support pertaining to my ascension to the throne.</i>

150
00:14:47,714 --> 00:14:52,544
With this, we can uncover Grand
Prince Jin Yang's crime.

151
00:15:18,944 --> 00:15:23,353
Your Highness, you have to eat a lot

152
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:26,024
and grow up quickly.

153
00:16:35,434 --> 00:16:37,444
Did we get caught?

154
00:17:02,514 --> 00:17:04,263
Your Highness. Your Highness!

155
00:17:04,264 --> 00:17:06,484
What's the matter?

156
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:12,464
My brother is coming. We must leave!

157
00:17:14,494 --> 00:17:17,123
Gi Teuk! Jin Yang is coming!
Jin Yang's coming!

158
00:17:17,124 --> 00:17:19,733
- Who is it?
- Hurry, get up! Hurry!

159
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:23,193
- We must run!
- There must be a fire!

160
00:17:23,194 --> 00:17:26,684
- How did he...?
- Hurry, hurry!

161
00:17:43,094 --> 00:17:46,673
Your Highness, how did Grand
Prince Jin Yang find out?

162
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:49,403
Take His Highness and the lady and leave.

163
00:17:49,404 --> 00:17:51,843
We will try to make time.

164
00:17:51,844 --> 00:17:55,223
We need to all leave. Since His
Highness is here, we can't fight here!

165
00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:57,923
The king probably is on his way because
he knows. We'll be pursued soon!

166
00:17:57,924 --> 00:18:01,143
I will meet Grand Prince Jin Yang.
Escape this place.

167
00:18:01,144 --> 00:18:04,223
I will not leave you to be in
front of my brother again.

168
00:18:04,224 --> 00:18:06,153
If there is a fight here, His
Highness will be in danger.

169
00:18:06,154 --> 00:18:07,883
Does that mean it's okay
if you're in danger?

170
00:18:07,884 --> 00:18:10,703
The person who tortured me is Na
Gyeom, not Grand Prince Jin Yang.

171
00:18:10,704 --> 00:18:13,383
I'm sure that we were caught because of
my family coming in and out of here.

172
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,943
If I take the lead, he won't be suspicious.

173
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:17,743
He doesn't know you're
alive, Your Highness.

174
00:18:17,744 --> 00:18:18,893
I can't leave you here.

175
00:18:18,894 --> 00:18:23,123
- Think about His Highness.
- I'll stay behind.

176
00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:25,873
Grand Prince Jin Yang
won't do anything to me.

177
00:18:25,874 --> 00:18:30,333
The queen sent me to the Jeongubwon.
The monks are here.

178
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:32,293
Hurry and go! We have no time.

179
00:18:32,294 --> 00:18:36,284
After I take the prince
somewhere safe, I'll come back.

180
00:19:16,094 --> 00:19:18,173
Did you know I would be coming?

181
00:19:18,174 --> 00:19:23,234
The monks told me that they
thought a guest had arrived.

182
00:19:29,364 --> 00:19:35,044
Your Majesty, that woman is the barbarian minion
that used to follow Grand Prince Eun Seong around.

183
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:40,743
She had nowhere to go, so
I am taking care of her.

184
00:19:40,744 --> 00:19:42,354
Leave her be.

185
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:46,314
Isn't she a woman?

186
00:19:52,574 --> 00:19:54,843
How are you feeling?

187
00:19:54,844 --> 00:20:00,003
Scars on the body get better with time.

188
00:20:00,004 --> 00:20:02,474
Will you give me some tea?

189
00:20:14,094 --> 00:20:16,224
Come this way.

190
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:28,163
Search around to see if any others left.

191
00:20:28,164 --> 00:20:29,794
Yes, sir!

192
00:20:47,904 --> 00:20:51,583
Why didn't you kill me?

193
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:57,033
From your point of view, I
committed high treason.

194
00:20:57,034 --> 00:20:59,874
You are being punished enough, aren't you?

195
00:21:02,374 --> 00:21:07,914
Living in a world without Hwi is
like living in hell, isn't it?

196
00:21:10,964 --> 00:21:16,884
Killing you is the same
as granting your wish.

197
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,334
If you die,

198
00:21:21,214 --> 00:21:27,124
the two of you will unite
again, and I'll be alone.

199
00:21:29,334 --> 00:21:35,414
I wish to keep you in this
world, even if you hate me.

200
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:39,523
How did you escape the Jeongubwon?

201
00:21:39,524 --> 00:21:44,043
He may be gone. But his
people still remain.

202
00:21:44,044 --> 00:21:46,743
They brought me here and left.

203
00:21:46,744 --> 00:21:49,133
They are the real traitors.

204
00:21:49,134 --> 00:21:53,794
To me, they are the saviors of my life.

205
00:22:01,284 --> 00:22:04,303
We are not safe yet. We have to go farther.

206
00:22:04,304 --> 00:22:06,544
Your Highness!

207
00:22:09,784 --> 00:22:14,433
- Don't look back. Go to the brothel right away. Let's meet there.
- Your Highness.

208
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:18,644
Take care of His Highness.
I'm trusting you.

209
00:22:21,064 --> 00:22:23,503
Uncle!

210
00:22:23,504 --> 00:22:25,214
Let's go.

211
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:33,443
Living in hiding like this,

212
00:22:33,444 --> 00:22:39,204
I realized that whether it's the Jeongubwon
or here, both are like a prison.

213
00:22:40,114 --> 00:22:43,233
Let me go back home.

214
00:22:43,234 --> 00:22:45,043
I want to be with my family.

215
00:22:45,044 --> 00:22:49,393
Sending you to the Jeongubwon
was the queen's order.

216
00:22:49,394 --> 00:22:51,943
Aren't you strong enough now?

217
00:22:51,944 --> 00:22:57,084
You don't need to worry about the
people above or inside of the court.

218
00:23:01,144 --> 00:23:06,693
Have you forgotten Eun Seong now?

219
00:23:06,694 --> 00:23:11,203
It'll be a lie if I say I have.

220
00:23:11,204 --> 00:23:15,123
But what is definite is that I am alive

221
00:23:15,124 --> 00:23:19,294
while he... is dead.

222
00:23:28,544 --> 00:23:30,333
What do you want?

223
00:23:30,334 --> 00:23:32,854
I don't want to be your concubine.

224
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:41,324
Then?
- I want to become your queen.

225
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:27,863
If my father returns safely from
Ming, dethrone the current queen,

226
00:24:27,864 --> 00:24:32,104
and give me that position.

227
00:24:34,754 --> 00:24:40,284
So that is what all women want ultimately.

228
00:24:44,424 --> 00:24:48,933
You are starting to resemble my queen.

229
00:24:48,934 --> 00:24:51,993
I don't want to be trampled on again.

230
00:24:51,994 --> 00:24:55,133
If you can't do that for me,
then you better forget me.

231
00:24:55,134 --> 00:25:00,283
She may be a King's woman. But a royal
concubine is still a concubine.

232
00:25:00,284 --> 00:25:04,183
Na Gyeom won't leave me alive.

233
00:25:04,184 --> 00:25:09,024
I won't enter the palace just to
be whipped and tortured again.

234
00:25:10,044 --> 00:25:14,293
If it's not everything, I'd
rather not have anything.

235
00:25:14,294 --> 00:25:17,693
I am the King of Joseon now.

236
00:25:17,694 --> 00:25:21,373
You should be grovelling at my feet.
What makes you so confident?

237
00:25:21,374 --> 00:25:26,834
Prince Eun Seong staked
his everything for me.

238
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:34,344
You too stake your everything.
Otherwise, you'll never move my heart.

239
00:25:38,424 --> 00:25:41,854
Didn't you hate me to death?

240
00:25:42,804 --> 00:25:49,243
Did your vengeance towards the queen...
outstrip that hatred?

241
00:25:49,244 --> 00:25:55,633
Didn't you come here in the
dead of the night to see me?

242
00:25:55,634 --> 00:26:00,243
To subdue the remnants of the rebellion that you are
suspicious of, you could have just sent soldiers.

243
00:26:00,244 --> 00:26:06,694
But you came here personally. Isn't it
because you wanted to see me even like this?

244
00:26:09,054 --> 00:26:14,064
That heart of yours might move me.

245
00:26:15,814 --> 00:26:18,553
Whether it's love or
obsession, you said that

246
00:26:18,554 --> 00:26:24,543
it hurts your heart just the same.
Show that heart to me.

247
00:26:24,544 --> 00:26:31,984
Then, even my frozen heart
may meltdown, who knows?

248
00:26:35,204 --> 00:26:41,303
If that day comes, I will call you
"My King" instead of "Grand Prince".

249
00:26:41,304 --> 00:26:49,304
You committed a deadly crime just by
calling me Grand Prince right now.

250
00:26:49,424 --> 00:26:56,034
Did you ever see me frightened of death?

251
00:27:29,034 --> 00:27:31,074
Mind your step.

252
00:27:46,544 --> 00:27:49,404
Stay here for the time being.

253
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,603
Won't anyone see us?

254
00:27:53,604 --> 00:27:57,293
I stopped accepting other
customers after I lost my eye.

255
00:27:57,294 --> 00:28:02,974
I also sent out all the servants, so
you'll be safe as long as you stay inside.

256
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:08,564
Since it turned out like this, let's
pretend to be servants of this place.

257
00:28:09,584 --> 00:28:13,244
That's a good idea.
- They'll have meat here, right?

258
00:28:14,604 --> 00:28:18,603
Your life is hanging by a thread,
and you can still think of meat?

259
00:28:18,604 --> 00:28:22,464
If you die with a full stomach, even
your ghost will look good, they say.

260
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:27,983
Please wait for a while. I will bring food.

261
00:28:27,984 --> 00:28:29,753
Thank you!

262
00:28:29,754 --> 00:28:32,363
I'm so grateful that I
don't know what to say.

263
00:28:32,364 --> 00:28:34,544
You're amazing.

264
00:29:36,754 --> 00:29:39,554
For now, let's say that you are not well.

265
00:29:40,924 --> 00:29:44,433
Since that was your only excuse
for leaving the Jeongubwon.

266
00:29:44,434 --> 00:29:45,394
Thank you.

267
00:29:45,395 --> 00:29:49,674
However, I will leave a guard behind.

268
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:54,464
I can't have you run away from me

269
00:29:55,984 --> 00:29:57,293
a second time.

270
00:29:57,294 --> 00:30:02,263
Since I have determined on something,
I won't live as an outlaw.

271
00:30:02,264 --> 00:30:07,383
I don't need a guard. But if
that's what you want, go ahead.

272
00:30:07,384 --> 00:30:09,003
Go inside.

273
00:30:09,004 --> 00:30:12,604
I'll be waiting to hear from you.

274
00:30:29,864 --> 00:30:33,354
<i>[Dragon Tiger Gate]</i>

275
00:30:49,844 --> 00:30:51,604
Are you okay?

276
00:30:54,284 --> 00:30:58,594
Do you think he is safe?

277
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:11,073
Do you think she was being sincere?

278
00:31:11,074 --> 00:31:14,464
How could I possibly know a lady's heart?

279
00:31:15,454 --> 00:31:20,383
But what is certain is that
Prince Eun Seong is dead,

280
00:31:20,384 --> 00:31:23,624
and you have become the king.

281
00:31:24,714 --> 00:31:27,813
Whether it's because the shock has
died down after time has passed...

282
00:31:27,814 --> 00:31:31,823
Now, you seem to have a
sharp mind once again.

283
00:31:31,824 --> 00:31:37,773
I thought she resembled Hwi. But
she has started resembling me.

284
00:31:37,774 --> 00:31:40,123
Do you not like that?

285
00:31:40,124 --> 00:31:45,404
I like it... and I don't like it.

286
00:32:06,204 --> 00:32:07,783
For now, sleep.

287
00:32:07,784 --> 00:32:11,293
Get some good sleep now and
think about it tomorrow.

288
00:32:11,294 --> 00:32:15,263
Since you're here at home, that's enough.

289
00:32:15,264 --> 00:32:20,834
Since I'll be able to feed you and clothe you
with my own hands... That's something big.

290
00:32:27,544 --> 00:32:29,954
Mother...

291
00:32:37,694 --> 00:32:39,924
It's good that you came.

292
00:32:40,654 --> 00:32:44,953
I would hope that you don't
have hardships anymore,

293
00:32:44,954 --> 00:32:49,134
but living doesn't go as we want it to.

294
00:32:57,074 --> 00:33:01,664
So, I got stronger too.

295
00:33:03,204 --> 00:33:05,283
There is no more of the Ja
Hyeon who grew within a flower

296
00:33:05,284 --> 00:33:10,844
in the shadows of you and Father.

297
00:33:12,764 --> 00:33:16,414
I'm not afraid now.

298
00:33:17,284 --> 00:33:21,344
As long as we live, there is hope...

299
00:33:22,124 --> 00:33:24,834
His Highness said this.

300
00:33:50,584 --> 00:33:52,254
Your Majesty.

301
00:33:53,294 --> 00:33:55,064
Your Majesty.

302
00:34:07,904 --> 00:34:10,143
Where did you go?

303
00:34:10,144 --> 00:34:13,123
Being only in the palace got
stuffy, so I went to get some air.

304
00:34:13,124 --> 00:34:16,243
The palace is so large,
but it feels stuffy?

305
00:34:16,244 --> 00:34:20,603
There are so many places within the
palace that I still have not visited.

306
00:34:20,604 --> 00:34:24,364
- What is the matter?
- I must tell you something.

307
00:34:30,224 --> 00:34:31,873
You're pregnant?

308
00:34:31,874 --> 00:34:36,103
Yes, Your Majesty. The
doctor felt my pulse.

309
00:34:36,104 --> 00:34:39,113
Having no sign of pregnancy
after three years of marriage

310
00:34:39,114 --> 00:34:41,683
caused me to be greatly worried.

311
00:34:41,684 --> 00:34:46,524
But, the baby must have waited
to be born in the palace.

312
00:34:49,094 --> 00:34:54,224
I will give birth to a grand prince who
will be a wonja (to-be crown prince).

313
00:34:55,614 --> 00:34:59,724
A son who will be like you, for sure.

314
00:35:10,264 --> 00:35:15,513
Your Majesty. How could you lie about that?

315
00:35:15,514 --> 00:35:17,353
How will you deal with it in the future?

316
00:35:17,354 --> 00:35:20,303
I will just make it become true.

317
00:35:20,304 --> 00:35:24,493
For now, I must have the king
not think about anything else.

318
00:35:24,494 --> 00:35:28,024
I need to solidify my spot as the queen.

319
00:36:35,204 --> 00:36:40,404
- I'm sorry.
- Wait a moment.

320
00:36:49,064 --> 00:36:52,734
You can open your eyes now.

321
00:37:02,794 --> 00:37:05,764
Please sit over h-here.

322
00:37:18,104 --> 00:37:22,243
What about the prince? Is he okay?

323
00:37:22,244 --> 00:37:25,123
- He should be.
- He should be?

324
00:37:25,124 --> 00:37:28,384
Didn't you bring the
prince all the way back?

325
00:37:29,564 --> 00:37:32,683
I couldn't just go because
I was worried about you.

326
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:35,763
I was following you, and when the person
keeping an eye on you fell asleep,

327
00:37:35,764 --> 00:37:38,033
I crossed over.

328
00:37:38,034 --> 00:37:40,303
The safety of the prince is more important!

329
00:37:40,304 --> 00:37:43,373
To me, you are as precious as the prince.

330
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:47,313
Next time, you can trust me.

331
00:37:47,314 --> 00:37:50,283
If I wasn't confident,

332
00:37:50,284 --> 00:37:53,184
I wouldn't have been stubborn
about staying behind by myself.

333
00:37:58,714 --> 00:38:00,983
What were you so confident about?

334
00:38:00,984 --> 00:38:06,213
Did you believe that since my brother
wants you, he wouldn't be dangerous?

335
00:38:06,214 --> 00:38:11,034
Did you think that you could
handle his intentions?

336
00:38:14,594 --> 00:38:20,843
As I was secretly following you and
my brother walking along a path...

337
00:38:20,844 --> 00:38:23,553
Were you miserable?

338
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:26,863
Were you jealous?

339
00:38:26,864 --> 00:38:28,383
I realized

340
00:38:28,384 --> 00:38:32,863
that I am just one man amongst many others.

341
00:38:32,864 --> 00:38:36,393
I realized that I am not as good
of a person as I thought I was.

342
00:38:36,394 --> 00:38:40,894
I, too, was jealous of Roo Si Gae.

343
00:38:42,254 --> 00:38:45,743
No, Roo Si Gae is not a woman,

344
00:38:45,744 --> 00:38:49,243
but someone like a younger sister.

345
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:54,703
I was envious of Eunuch Park who's
been with you since you were children.

346
00:38:54,704 --> 00:38:59,253
I was also envious of the prisoners who had
gone through such difficult times with you.

347
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:03,373
I was also envious of your first love,

348
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:06,533
the palace maid who had a deep
and genuine affection for you.

349
00:39:06,534 --> 00:39:11,663
Yeon Hee? Who did you hear that from?

350
00:39:11,664 --> 00:39:13,883
She wasn't my first love. She wasn't.

351
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:16,994
After meeting you, I realized this.

352
00:39:17,684 --> 00:39:22,653
To carry someone within your
heart can be like Hell all day,

353
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:26,904
but it can also feel like
Heaven in just a moment.

354
00:39:27,974 --> 00:39:31,383
That temporary happiness

355
00:39:31,384 --> 00:39:33,924
helps to get through the
remaining Hell-like times.

356
00:39:36,914 --> 00:39:39,503
Now, I lie, too.

357
00:39:39,504 --> 00:39:44,063
I say things that are ingenuine and act.

358
00:39:44,064 --> 00:39:49,084
I don't think I'm the Ja
Hyeon I was in the past.

359
00:39:58,424 --> 00:40:02,544
Everything has changed
and become different.

360
00:40:03,794 --> 00:40:07,773
But, my feelings for you are
the same, Your Highness.

361
00:40:07,774 --> 00:40:09,804
Me, too.

362
00:40:10,904 --> 00:40:15,263
Those exhausting days where I
couldn't even know the future...

363
00:40:15,264 --> 00:40:17,974
You were the only thing clear to me.

364
00:40:22,084 --> 00:40:25,723
♫ <i>If I just keep walking</i> ♫

365
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:28,963
♫ <i>like this endlessly</i> ♫

366
00:40:28,964 --> 00:40:30,953
Is it okay for you to return to home?

367
00:40:30,954 --> 00:40:33,603
I agreed to become a sick person.

368
00:40:33,604 --> 00:40:38,973
I told them that I left the
Jeongubwon as a result of an illness.

369
00:40:38,974 --> 00:40:44,284
What a relief that you can be at home now.

370
00:40:46,304 --> 00:40:51,993
I liked being with you more, Your Highness.

371
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:54,713
Me, too. I was happy.

372
00:40:54,714 --> 00:40:57,693
If I had known that the happiness
would end this quickly,

373
00:40:57,694 --> 00:41:00,434
I would have stuck with you more.

374
00:41:01,344 --> 00:41:07,154
We could've played with flowers
and drawn the scenery.

375
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:14,243
Next time, when we are together,

376
00:41:14,244 --> 00:41:17,633
We will be husband and wife,

377
00:41:17,634 --> 00:41:20,354
don't you think so?

378
00:41:21,914 --> 00:41:25,693
♫ <i>The places I want to go to,</i> ♫

379
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:29,453
♫ <i>The places I need to go to</i> ♫

380
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:36,543
♫ <i>Perhaps I don't want to know forever</i> ♫

381
00:41:36,544 --> 00:41:38,573
I will bring you my brother's clothes.

382
00:41:38,574 --> 00:41:40,773
Rather than going out in
these everyday clothes,

383
00:41:40,774 --> 00:41:44,773
leaving here as if you're a person from
this household would probably be best.

384
00:41:44,774 --> 00:41:52,774
♫ <i>When I get there, will
I call out only then?</i> ♫

385
00:41:53,954 --> 00:41:56,874
♫ <i>That it's you</i> ♫

386
00:42:02,174 --> 00:42:07,093
In the future, if you need to send a message, I
ask you to tell my brother and not Kkeut Dan.

387
00:42:07,094 --> 00:42:10,023
To make going in and out of
the streets not look strange,

388
00:42:10,024 --> 00:42:12,143
I think having a man do
that would be better.

389
00:42:12,144 --> 00:42:16,384
Since Roo Si Gae is also there,
messages could be exchanged.

390
00:42:18,404 --> 00:42:20,153
Please be careful.

391
00:42:20,154 --> 00:42:22,334
You, too.

392
00:43:12,304 --> 00:43:15,504
Is it true that you are pregnant?

393
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:20,233
Yes, Your Highness. I planned on
informing you later on, but...

394
00:43:20,234 --> 00:43:24,023
Let's call for the pharmacy
to start making a tonic.

395
00:43:24,024 --> 00:43:28,723
Royalty is precious, so you
should be especially careful.

396
00:43:28,724 --> 00:43:33,563
I am so happy that I will have a son,
especially right after coming into the palace.

397
00:43:33,564 --> 00:43:36,913
I feel like I have given great news to
a royal family that has mourned a lot,

398
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:39,434
so that makes me very happy.

399
00:43:42,354 --> 00:43:44,163
Congratulations, Your Highness.

400
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:47,813
It is a happy event for the royal
family in such a long time.

401
00:43:47,814 --> 00:43:50,554
You have worked hard, Your Majesty.

402
00:43:51,634 --> 00:43:55,843
But, Your Highness, how much longer
do I have to show my manners

403
00:43:55,844 --> 00:43:59,923
to this deposed woman?

404
00:43:59,924 --> 00:44:01,724
Your Majesty!

405
00:44:02,624 --> 00:44:04,914
It is fine, Your Highness.

406
00:44:05,614 --> 00:44:07,373
I didn't think it through.

407
00:44:07,374 --> 00:44:11,843
Even after being deposed, I am grateful
that I can still remain in the palace.

408
00:44:11,844 --> 00:44:14,764
The queen has shown her manners enough.

409
00:44:15,414 --> 00:44:17,493
Whatever the cause may be,

410
00:44:17,494 --> 00:44:20,953
The Queen was the wife of former
King and your older sister in law.

411
00:44:20,954 --> 00:44:25,533
No matter what the situation may be, she is
not someone to be thoughtlessly talked to.

412
00:44:25,534 --> 00:44:28,423
I didn't have any other meaning
behind it, Your Highness.

413
00:44:28,424 --> 00:44:35,114
I just was curious about the customs of the
royal family, since I must protect them.

414
00:44:44,774 --> 00:44:46,843
<i>Letter of response from Grand Prince Jin Yang to Jurchen's Huligai Tribe,
Chieftain Li Man Zhu: Immediately, from the battlefield we will retreat to Joseon</i>

415
00:44:46,844 --> 00:44:48,833
<i>and Gen. Choe Yun Deok will return the four sovereign counties to you
in return for your support pertaining to my ascension to the throne.</i>

416
00:44:48,834 --> 00:44:53,444
Is this saying that Grand Prince Jin Yang
is handing over Yongto land to the Juchens?

417
00:44:56,924 --> 00:45:00,123
What will you do about this now?

418
00:45:00,124 --> 00:45:03,163
Let's post it. Somewhere where
many people can see it.

419
00:45:03,164 --> 00:45:07,213
Are you stupid? It'd be immediately
taken down by the government.

420
00:45:07,214 --> 00:45:09,393
Roo Shi Gae has a good point.

421
00:45:09,394 --> 00:45:14,704
We can let the people know and move their
opinions. And that of the ministers as well.

422
00:45:17,104 --> 00:45:20,133
Even if Uncle lost his official position,

423
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:24,593
many of the ministers are his followers.

424
00:45:24,594 --> 00:45:28,193
When hyungnim's anger subsides,

425
00:45:28,194 --> 00:45:31,684
they must believe that Uncle will
return to the court ministers.

426
00:45:33,524 --> 00:45:39,773
Chief Scholar is not in the country to help us
convince the ministers, so it's not in our favor.

427
00:45:39,774 --> 00:45:44,053
Then... Do we have to wait
until Chief Scholar returns?

428
00:45:44,054 --> 00:45:49,013
We do not wait for time. We make it.

429
00:45:49,014 --> 00:45:51,893
The reason why my brother was
able to cast the prince aside

430
00:45:51,894 --> 00:45:55,963
was because he cut off the
guardians of the prince.

431
00:45:55,964 --> 00:45:59,174
Left Minister and Me.

432
00:46:04,634 --> 00:46:06,963
We will use this as a weapon and,

433
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:11,094
we must cut off the rotting
foot of my brother first.

434
00:46:25,384 --> 00:46:28,493
Why would His Highness talk all
about the important stuff?

435
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,293
They should secretly talk
about it amongst themselves.

436
00:46:30,294 --> 00:46:33,573
It's because we're important people, too.

437
00:46:33,574 --> 00:46:36,933
This is the first time I've been
treated like this in all of my life.

438
00:46:36,934 --> 00:46:40,603
I couldn't understand a
word of what was said.

439
00:46:40,604 --> 00:46:43,653
It's just best for me to
do what is ordered of me.

440
00:46:43,654 --> 00:46:45,494
Oh, look at this!

441
00:46:46,354 --> 00:46:48,013
Is Eunuch Park inside?

442
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:51,293
Why would a gisaeng ask such a thing?

443
00:46:51,294 --> 00:46:53,303
He's handsome.

444
00:46:53,304 --> 00:46:55,793
Will you live like that
based off of his looks?

445
00:46:55,794 --> 00:47:00,083
Also, Gi Teuk...

446
00:47:00,084 --> 00:47:03,663
Eunuchs get married, too.
They do everything.

447
00:47:03,664 --> 00:47:05,273
How do you know such a thing?

448
00:47:05,274 --> 00:47:07,243
There are many gisaengs (female entertainers)
who have gotten married to eunuchs.

449
00:47:07,244 --> 00:47:10,374
Those who have nothing are
better off than I am.

450
00:47:16,994 --> 00:47:21,403
Your Highness, I've brought some snacks.

451
00:47:21,404 --> 00:47:23,263
So.

452
00:47:23,264 --> 00:47:27,474
Being an eunuch or whatever... Do
you need to be handsome first?

453
00:47:29,874 --> 00:47:31,833
These dim-wits.

454
00:47:31,834 --> 00:47:34,904
I am not hanging around with you.

455
00:47:35,904 --> 00:47:38,704
Me too.

456
00:47:39,734 --> 00:47:42,023
Isn't that the case?

457
00:47:42,024 --> 00:47:46,163
We are trying to track Prince Seungpyung
after receiving the king's order.

458
00:47:46,164 --> 00:47:49,853
But, maybe Grand Prince Yang
Ahn is keeping hold of him.

459
00:47:49,854 --> 00:47:52,193
I am suspicious.

460
00:47:52,194 --> 00:47:57,703
If he has Prince Seungpyung, then he has a cause to
lead a restoration of the king whenever he wants.

461
00:47:57,704 --> 00:48:00,273
Right now, he doesn't have a good
relationship with the king, either.

462
00:48:00,274 --> 00:48:01,633
Be careful with your words.

463
00:48:01,634 --> 00:48:05,174
You seem to be slandering me in
order to escape my suspicions.

464
00:48:06,534 --> 00:48:10,964
Doesn't everyone know Grand Prince
Yang Ahn's true intentions?

465
00:48:12,354 --> 00:48:14,993
Right now, he is restricted
to his own home.

466
00:48:14,994 --> 00:48:19,874
The king considers him to
be a father-like figure.

467
00:48:21,074 --> 00:48:27,923
Grand Prince Yang Ahn truly is doing things
for His Majesty, and not for his own greed?

468
00:48:27,924 --> 00:48:30,393
Is that what you're trying to say?

469
00:48:30,394 --> 00:48:35,674
An ally within the lieges who
truly is loyal to His Majesty...

470
00:48:36,564 --> 00:48:39,834
There is no one else besides
you, Captain of Royal Guards.

471
00:48:40,564 --> 00:48:44,304
If you just look at the movements
of Grand Prince Yang Ahn,

472
00:48:44,974 --> 00:48:47,704
doesn't he have more of a
traitorous mind than a loyal one?

473
00:48:54,524 --> 00:48:59,133
So, have you thought about it?

474
00:48:59,134 --> 00:49:01,583
What is there to think about?

475
00:49:01,584 --> 00:49:06,323
A powerless, lowly person like
me does what is ordered of me.

476
00:49:06,324 --> 00:49:07,803
Good thinking.

477
00:49:07,804 --> 00:49:12,153
If you wait, then there will be a time
when you are called again in the future.

478
00:49:12,154 --> 00:49:16,603
I have given up the brothel and I'm
also settling things right now.

479
00:49:16,604 --> 00:49:20,464
But, I thought I'd need to give you
a farewell drink, Your Excellency.

480
00:49:21,424 --> 00:49:25,214
You must. Here, have a drink.

481
00:49:28,344 --> 00:49:34,044
By the way, did Grand Prince Yang
Ahn have a child late in his life?

482
00:49:35,244 --> 00:49:36,853
What are you saying?

483
00:49:36,854 --> 00:49:41,833
Even though he is in a position where he cannot do
anything as a grand prince... Thanks to his young son,

484
00:49:41,834 --> 00:49:45,964
they say that the crying never
stops within those walls.

485
00:49:52,804 --> 00:49:55,253
Based on the words of the soldiers who
keep an eye on the grand prince's palace,

486
00:49:55,254 --> 00:49:59,883
they say there is a young boy who is
around the age of Prince Seungpyung.

487
00:49:59,884 --> 00:50:05,643
I've tried to talk to the Minister of Palace Guards but
he was so defensive we couldn't pass it on to the King.

488
00:50:05,644 --> 00:50:07,973
That is the problem with the
Captain of the Royal Guards!

489
00:50:07,974 --> 00:50:12,533
He is unaware of the importance of this
matter. I'll report this to His Majesty.

490
00:50:12,534 --> 00:50:16,434
How about if you do the honor.

491
00:50:22,064 --> 00:50:26,974
The position of the prime
minister is still empty.

492
00:50:28,434 --> 00:50:33,293
When the Chief Scholar returns from
China, wouldn't he be demoted?

493
00:50:33,294 --> 00:50:35,463
What did Chief Scholar do?

494
00:50:35,464 --> 00:50:40,643
To be frank who contributed the most
in getting the King to the throne?

495
00:50:40,644 --> 00:50:42,884
That was you, Your Excellency.

496
00:50:47,274 --> 00:50:50,503
Rather than the household that almost
became the in-laws of a criminal,

497
00:50:50,504 --> 00:50:54,724
We have to have a powerful
minister from the Queen's family.

498
00:50:56,604 --> 00:51:01,263
If you find Prince Seungpyoung
in the atmosphere we are in,

499
00:51:01,264 --> 00:51:06,434
you will have done a huge deed that
will relieve the King's worry.

500
00:51:10,044 --> 00:51:12,593
I do not know what Prince
Seungpyung looks like.

501
00:51:12,594 --> 00:51:16,933
For now, you should go and see if the child
in that house is really Prince Seungpyung.

502
00:51:16,934 --> 00:51:19,043
Find that out first.

503
00:51:19,044 --> 00:51:22,523
That order of things probably works best.

504
00:51:22,524 --> 00:51:27,604
When that is confirmed, you
should inform the king.

505
00:51:34,034 --> 00:51:37,763
Queen's older brother has
fallen into our trap.

506
00:51:37,764 --> 00:51:41,463
He seems to have jumped forward due to
his greed to become a prime minister.

507
00:51:41,464 --> 00:51:43,233
Did you get the children?

508
00:51:43,234 --> 00:51:48,754
Yes, I found a few children
who are around the same age.

509
00:51:49,704 --> 00:51:52,763
The children cannot be hurt.

510
00:51:52,764 --> 00:51:56,283
Things will be managed as if they are
one of our own. They will be safe.

511
00:51:56,284 --> 00:52:01,874
We will take out Hyungnim's
dogs, one by one.

512
00:52:40,104 --> 00:52:44,033
Check things thoroughly. If
there's a young boy, capture him.

513
00:52:44,034 --> 00:52:45,774
Yes, sir!

514
00:53:03,124 --> 00:53:04,854
Your Excellency.

515
00:53:23,644 --> 00:53:24,574
What's the matter?

516
00:53:24,575 --> 00:53:26,763
We will search your house.

517
00:53:26,764 --> 00:53:29,523
Even though I was discharged,

518
00:53:29,524 --> 00:53:31,683
put under a house arrest,

519
00:53:31,684 --> 00:53:36,123
I'm still the elder as the King's uncle.
What do you think you are doing?

520
00:53:36,124 --> 00:53:39,773
We have information that you have a
suspicious young boy staying at your house.

521
00:53:39,774 --> 00:53:41,463
A young boy?

522
00:53:41,464 --> 00:53:45,774
Catch him! Catch him! Catch him!

523
00:53:52,934 --> 00:53:54,083
Where is it?

524
00:53:54,084 --> 00:53:56,004
Over there, sir.

525
00:54:08,504 --> 00:54:09,733
- Where?
- Over there!

526
00:54:09,734 --> 00:54:11,063
- Over here.
- Get out of my way.

527
00:54:11,064 --> 00:54:13,403
Move out of the way!

528
00:54:13,404 --> 00:54:15,534
There is nothing over there.

529
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:29,654
Go.

530
00:54:34,964 --> 00:54:36,733
Over there, there.

531
00:54:36,734 --> 00:54:38,813
You go that way and you go this way!

532
00:54:38,814 --> 00:54:40,363
Why is he so fast?

533
00:54:40,364 --> 00:54:42,184
One moment.

534
00:54:45,144 --> 00:54:47,274
Why are you doing this?

535
00:54:53,344 --> 00:54:56,303
Minister, Minister, I got him.

536
00:54:56,304 --> 00:54:59,334
I got him here.

537
00:55:08,664 --> 00:55:12,623
How dare you put a wedge
between me and the King.

538
00:55:12,624 --> 00:55:14,383
What are you conspiring?

539
00:55:14,384 --> 00:55:18,003
Conspire? Isn't this something
you started yourself?

540
00:55:18,004 --> 00:55:21,583
In whose name are you doing this?
For what reason?

541
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:25,513
Minister, I'm simply doing the
work of the Investigation Bureau.

542
00:55:25,514 --> 00:55:29,554
As the servant of this country, Joseon.

543
00:55:32,534 --> 00:55:34,524
This bastard.

544
00:56:24,544 --> 00:56:26,194
Minister!

545
00:56:30,344 --> 00:56:32,533
How can you do this?

546
00:56:32,534 --> 00:56:34,834
To Prince Seungpyung?

547
00:56:38,334 --> 00:56:40,094
Your Excellency!

548
00:56:47,914 --> 00:56:51,624
We found a strange document in your room.

549
00:56:54,784 --> 00:56:57,103
Do you know what this is?

550
00:56:57,104 --> 00:57:00,480
<i>Letter of response from Grand Prince Jin Yang to Jurchen's Huligai Tribe,
Chieftain Li Man Zhu: Immediately, from the battlefield we will retreat to Joseon</i>

551
00:57:00,504 --> 00:57:06,064
<i>and Gen. Choe Yun Deok will return the four sovereign counties to you
in return for your support pertaining to my ascension to the throne.</i>

552
00:57:06,544 --> 00:57:10,444
<i>Letter stamped with royal seal
of Grand Prince Jin Yang.</i>

553
00:57:14,454 --> 00:57:16,553
How dare you!

554
00:57:16,554 --> 00:57:18,494
You bastards.

555
00:57:19,654 --> 00:57:22,764
You... You...

556
00:57:24,264 --> 00:57:26,224
You...

557
00:57:31,354 --> 00:57:33,523
The one who kidnapped Prince Seungpyung was

558
00:57:33,524 --> 00:57:36,363
Grand Prince Yang An.

559
00:57:36,364 --> 00:57:38,103
He worked with the Jurchens and

560
00:57:38,104 --> 00:57:41,493
obtained the secret document
you told us to guard,

561
00:57:41,494 --> 00:57:43,523
and made it into a weapon
that is not a threat.

562
00:57:43,524 --> 00:57:45,543
Then took Prince Seungpyung
to raise him separately,

563
00:57:45,544 --> 00:57:49,584
with a goal to make him the next heir.

564
00:57:50,254 --> 00:57:54,593
So, did you find the young boy?

565
00:57:54,594 --> 00:57:57,323
We searched the premise but
we were one step too late.

566
00:57:57,324 --> 00:58:01,043
But it is certain that he has
been taken care of there.

567
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:03,833
I saw it myself.

568
00:58:03,834 --> 00:58:06,733
Go find him in haste.

569
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:08,964
Right now!

570
00:58:15,574 --> 00:58:19,343
What do you want to do
with Grand Prince Yang An?

571
00:58:19,344 --> 00:58:21,694
I will have to give him

572
00:58:23,104 --> 00:58:25,604
the last greeting.

573
00:58:33,074 --> 00:58:36,563
Your Majesty, all of this is,

574
00:58:36,564 --> 00:58:40,293
a entrapment by the enemies
to cause a misunderstanding.

575
00:58:40,294 --> 00:58:43,953
I will for sure reveal their plans.

576
00:58:43,954 --> 00:58:46,733
What were you going to do that young boy?

577
00:58:46,734 --> 00:58:48,913
This is unfair, Your Majesty.

578
00:58:48,914 --> 00:58:52,163
I have never even seen Prince Seungpyung.

579
00:58:52,164 --> 00:58:57,513
When and how did you get hold of
the document from the Jurchens?

580
00:58:57,514 --> 00:59:01,533
That also, I have never seen, Your Majesty.

581
00:59:01,534 --> 00:59:04,373
This is all a trap set by them.

582
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:07,414
Who are they exactly?

583
00:59:12,444 --> 00:59:15,563
Is dead Eun Seong sharpening
the knife from heaven?

584
00:59:15,564 --> 00:59:18,243
Did my late brother become a ghost,

585
00:59:18,244 --> 00:59:21,524
and is he looking after his little boy?

586
00:59:25,404 --> 00:59:27,413
At least give me some excuses.

587
00:59:27,414 --> 00:59:30,433
The monster nephew you raised
is not following your orders,

588
00:59:30,434 --> 00:59:33,464
so you needed a new puppet!

589
00:59:35,874 --> 00:59:38,134
Get yourself together
(speaking informally).

590
00:59:39,644 --> 00:59:43,423
I gave my whole life to you
and tortured the former king.

591
00:59:43,424 --> 00:59:46,513
I killed Eun Seong and
got rid of a competitor.

592
00:59:46,514 --> 00:59:49,333
And at last, I wanted to
get rid of the young one,

593
00:59:49,334 --> 00:59:52,233
so that your path will
be solid going forward.

594
00:59:52,234 --> 00:59:56,784
How can you attack your
own relative this way?

595
00:59:57,344 --> 01:00:01,224
If it wasn't me, you would never
have made it to where you are.

596
01:00:01,914 --> 01:00:04,093
You are a King I made.

597
01:00:04,094 --> 01:00:06,304
You're right.

598
01:00:07,094 --> 01:00:09,424
I am King.

599
01:00:10,304 --> 01:00:13,334
Do you know what that means?

600
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:16,984
I no longer,

601
01:00:17,944 --> 01:00:20,774
need you, Uncle.

602
01:00:24,244 --> 01:00:26,034
Your Majesty.

603
01:00:27,644 --> 01:00:30,324
Are you out there, Eo Eul Woon?

604
01:00:40,014 --> 01:00:42,493
Escort the uncle.

605
01:00:42,494 --> 01:00:44,973
Given all that he has done,

606
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:48,073
I can't let him die in prison.

607
01:00:48,074 --> 01:00:49,924
Your Majesty.

608
01:00:50,964 --> 01:00:52,993
Your Majesty, please don't do this.

609
01:00:52,994 --> 01:00:55,453
You can't do this to me.

610
01:00:55,454 --> 01:01:00,224
Your Majesty. Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

611
01:01:36,634 --> 01:01:39,333
Take it away.

612
01:01:39,334 --> 01:01:42,663
You bastards. Do you not know who I am?

613
01:01:42,664 --> 01:01:44,863
I am the uncle of the King.

614
01:01:44,864 --> 01:01:49,593
One who made the King into King.

615
01:01:49,594 --> 01:01:52,624
That's why a day like this has come.

616
01:02:05,904 --> 01:02:08,863
To the Grand Prince who shouldn't be king,

617
01:02:08,864 --> 01:02:11,823
you planted misdirected ambition into him.

618
01:02:11,824 --> 01:02:15,013
You misguided loyal servants,
killed a brother and a nephew,

619
01:02:15,014 --> 01:02:18,723
and made him be known as
an evil king in history.

620
01:02:18,724 --> 01:02:23,713
The time has come for you
to pay the price, Uncle.

621
01:02:23,714 --> 01:02:25,534
Eun Seong.

622
01:02:26,434 --> 01:02:31,444
Are you my grim reaper?

623
01:02:38,574 --> 01:02:41,113
Hyungnim ordered poison.

624
01:02:41,114 --> 01:02:45,863
Remember this clearly
until your last breath.

625
01:02:45,864 --> 01:02:47,784
You are,

626
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:53,423
dying at the hands of a nephew you raised.

627
01:02:53,424 --> 01:02:57,973
Eun Seong. You were alive.

628
01:02:57,974 --> 01:03:00,313
I had to die twice.

629
01:03:00,314 --> 01:03:03,973
All of it because of you.

630
01:03:03,974 --> 01:03:07,133
But, I did not die.

631
01:03:07,134 --> 01:03:12,144
I am alive like this and
return to punish a criminal.

632
01:03:12,734 --> 01:03:14,943
I had to die without a reason,

633
01:03:14,944 --> 01:03:19,544
but I am letting you know of your crimes.

634
01:03:26,604 --> 01:03:28,254
Eun Seong.

635
01:03:29,414 --> 01:03:31,324
Eun Seong!

636
01:03:37,794 --> 01:03:41,664
Will you take the poison Grand
Prince bestowed upon you?

637
01:03:42,654 --> 01:03:47,674
Or a sword given to you
by Do Yeon Soo's son?

638
01:03:51,524 --> 01:03:54,764
You bastards!

639
01:04:28,144 --> 01:04:30,443
<i>Grand Prince</i>

640
01:04:30,444 --> 01:04:34,263
<i>The remaining rebels are using
the name of Prince Seungpyung</i>

641
01:04:34,264 --> 01:04:37,663
<i>and stirring up the people's feelings.
Find that little boy!</i>

642
01:04:37,664 --> 01:04:40,843
<i>We cannot succeed in our rebellion
without the help of the elders.</i>

643
01:04:40,844 --> 01:04:43,853
<i>It's time to let them know that
the former King and I are alive.</i>

644
01:04:43,854 --> 01:04:47,053
<i>Looks like we will have at
least another bloody battle.</i>

645
01:04:47,054 --> 01:04:49,823
<i>If Hyungnim's kite arrives
and the door opens,</i>

646
01:04:49,824 --> 01:04:52,803
<i>before they come out, we
cover them with the arrows.</i>

647
01:04:52,804 --> 01:04:55,133
<i>If this work fails,</i>

648
01:04:55,134 --> 01:04:57,673
<i>I'm not afraid.</i>

649
01:04:57,674 --> 01:05:00,564
<i>Today, I am going to be your bride.</i>

650
01:05:12,064 --> 01:05:15,334
<i>Grand Prince.</i>
