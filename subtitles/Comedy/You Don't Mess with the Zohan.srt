1
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,132
You don't mess with the Zohan!

2
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,244
Come disco.

3
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,649
No, no, no.
I no disco, I make the fish.

4
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,483
Danny, come on, go disco.

5
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,820
Oh, okay. Disco!

6
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,457
Danny, that looks good. You're gonna
be a hit at your bar mitzvah.

7
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,598
So okay, Mr. Big Penachim, I no see you disco.

8
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,600
No, no, no. I making dagim.
I no disco.

9
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:54,740
A real man, he can disco and cooking dagim.

10
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,000
So let's go.

11
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,247
Go, go.

12
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,580
I get the hummus for you.

13
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,150
And for you.

14
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:12,955
Little for me, eh!

15
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,022
No.

16
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,296
No.

17
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,335
Kapara, what is going on!

18
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,804
Just some bullshit-uchen.

19
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:30,866
Let's go!

20
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,980
Hey, I'm on vacation here.
Can't you see this!

21
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:39,050
You promised me time off.
Get someone else to do it.

22
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,517
Are they gonna hurt him!

23
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,819
No one can hurt the Zohan.

24
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:54,497
- Bye, Zohan.
- Take care, man.

25
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,521
The terrorist known as Phantom...

26
00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:18,815
...was spotted yesterday at a
Hacky Sack tournament in Beirut.

27
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,927
He may be have been trying to
bait us by surfacing briefly.

28
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,501
We believe he's being kept in a safe
house on the Lebanon border.

29
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:33,000
How is we lose Phantom!

30
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:35,571
Didn't I capture Phantom three months ago!

31
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,765
What, you didn't hear about the trade!

32
00:04:37,942 --> 00:04:39,068
What trade!

33
00:04:41,913 --> 00:04:43,847
Zohan, we gave back the Phantom.

34
00:04:44,015 --> 00:04:46,415
No!

35
00:04:46,584 --> 00:04:48,950
What do you mean, we give back the Phantom!

36
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,553
Zohan, relax.

37
00:04:50,722 --> 00:04:53,953
It was a good trade.
We got back Etan and David.

38
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,889
That's all we got for a veteran terrorist!

39
00:04:57,061 --> 00:04:59,586
Come on, we got hosed here.

40
00:04:59,764 --> 00:05:01,891
They threw in a spy to be named later.

41
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:04,193
Come on, Zohan, you have to like that deal.

42
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:06,132
Maybe they're talking about Ze'ev.

43
00:05:06,304 --> 00:05:08,738
Ze'ev.
Come on, he's not even a good spy.

44
00:05:08,906 --> 00:05:12,034
He got caught, for God's sake.
He's a stupid.

45
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,408
Our plan is to enter the building from
the front with a team of eight men...

46
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:19,277
...with an additional 12 men at perimeter positions.

47
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,284
Unfortunately, there is a high
probability of collateral damage...

48
00:05:23,454 --> 00:05:27,049
...including property and loss of life, on both sides.

49
00:05:27,225 --> 00:05:28,783
Okay, here we go.

50
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,154
Excuse me!

51
00:05:30,328 --> 00:05:33,627
Come on, is it not safer to send one man into building...

52
00:05:33,798 --> 00:05:36,062
...with minimal coverage to take out the target...

53
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:38,429
...instead of blowing up half the neighborhood!

54
00:05:38,603 --> 00:05:39,968
Well, who would do that!

55
00:05:40,138 --> 00:05:41,503
Oh, "who would do that!"

56
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:43,971
You know you were going to ask the Zohan.

57
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:45,336
Zohan, why you say this!

58
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,673
I just laid out an entire plan which didn't rely on you.

59
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:51,007
Come on, Yaron, you're setting me up.

60
00:05:51,182 --> 00:05:54,948
All this talk of civilian casualties,
then of course I end up doing it.

61
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:58,247
- But I'm not even asking you to do it.
- All right, I'll do it.

62
00:05:58,423 --> 00:06:02,189
Give me Avi and Koby as watch,
I'll get it done without the mess.

63
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,988
Well, thank you. You didn't have to.

64
00:06:05,163 --> 00:06:07,529
Oh, I didn't have to, bullschlassah.

65
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:09,856
Have some Fizzy Bubblech.

66
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:14,303
"Kiwi watermelon"! Yeah, is good.

67
00:06:57,181 --> 00:06:59,709
"Avalon."

68
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:20,266
Chunky cuts.

69
00:07:21,672 --> 00:07:23,765
Zohan, what are you doing!
The girls are here.

70
00:07:23,941 --> 00:07:25,772
I know, I was watching television.

71
00:07:25,943 --> 00:07:28,741
Well, if you want to have fun with us,
we're right next door.

72
00:07:28,913 --> 00:07:31,609
- Good with the sticky, you should do it.
- No, no, no.

73
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:34,616
I am going to dinner with my parents.
Just leave me alone.

74
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:38,085
- All right, all right.
- It is all right!

75
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,085
You don't giggle at the Zohan.

76
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:44,023
You hear me!
No giggling at the Zohan.

77
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:46,595
You never giggle at the Zohan.

78
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:52,766
What's the matter, tatele?

79
00:07:52,937 --> 00:07:55,770
You haven't touched your baba ganoush.

80
00:07:56,582 --> 00:07:57,971
abba, amma.

81
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:00,973
What would you think if I tell you...

82
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:03,443
...I want to leaving the army, start a new life!

83
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:08,978
Why would you do that!
You are good at it. It's steady pay.

84
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:11,144
You can't leave, you're one of their best.

85
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:13,449
Besides, you are too old to take a risk.

86
00:08:13,624 --> 00:08:16,460
Stay in the army, play it safe.

87
00:08:16,828 --> 00:08:19,924
Amma, There's other things I can do besides war.

88
00:08:20,097 --> 00:08:21,564
You don't war.

89
00:08:21,732 --> 00:08:24,326
- I was in the real war.
- I know, I know the story.

90
00:08:24,502 --> 00:08:26,663
1967.

91
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:30,672
We were surrounded on all sides, outnumbered.

92
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:33,072
- And in six days, we...
- And in six days, we won.

93
00:08:33,244 --> 00:08:35,872
You won. You won.
I'm sorry, I don't have a big fancy war...

94
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:37,639
...that lasted all of six days...

95
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:42,946
Six days and five hours.
Your generation likes to forget that.

96
00:08:45,156 --> 00:08:48,717
Dad, I've done so much
for the country. When does it end!

97
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:52,329
They've been fighting for 2000 years.
It can't be much longer.

98
00:08:52,564 --> 00:08:57,122
You know, All of my friends served
the minimum three years.

99
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:59,826
Why can't I move on!
Do something else.

100
00:09:00,004 --> 00:09:02,370
Something more creative.

101
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,201
Creative, what!

102
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,208
You've caught so many terrorists, it's an art.

103
00:09:07,378 --> 00:09:09,812
You're like Rembrandt with a grenade.

104
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:11,039
What will you do!

105
00:09:12,783 --> 00:09:14,444
Maybe go to America.

106
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:17,486
What, and haggle over stereo equipment!

107
00:09:17,655 --> 00:09:19,452
Wait a minute, Ya'acov.

108
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:22,286
Uncle Levi will set you up at electronic store.

109
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,987
You make money, sow your creative oats, you come back.

110
00:09:26,163 --> 00:09:28,893
No, I don't want to do electronics store.

111
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:31,160
Then how will you make money!

112
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,169
I don't want to say.

113
00:09:34,338 --> 00:09:38,502
Zohan, if you can't tell your parents, who can you tell!

114
00:09:38,676 --> 00:09:40,974
Come, Zohanele.

115
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:47,916
I want to cut...

116
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:51,054
...and style hair.

117
00:09:58,162 --> 00:10:00,562
You... You fagala?

118
00:10:00,731 --> 00:10:02,858
He's fag... Faga...

119
00:10:06,337 --> 00:10:09,465
I like hair.
It's pleasant, it's peaceful, no one gets hurt.

120
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:14,270
Well, you're only digging that fagala hole
deeper and deeper.

121
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:19,845
Hello, down there!
Hello, in the fagala hole.

122
00:10:20,885 --> 00:10:22,546
Maybe he wants Vaseline.

123
00:10:24,388 --> 00:10:27,084
Yes, it's so funny.

124
00:10:55,152 --> 00:11:02,149
I just want to make people silky smooth.

125
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:14,900
You know the Phantom will try to run,
so be ready for this.

126
00:11:15,072 --> 00:11:16,733
- Zohan, now!
- So let's go.

127
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:36,086
The Zohan.

128
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,337
Freeze!

129
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:04,486
I get it, I get it, you guys don't like our country.

130
00:12:11,695 --> 00:12:12,957
So we are the bad ones.

131
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,293
I'd love to sit and discuss this
with you, but I'm short on time.

132
00:12:16,467 --> 00:12:18,560
I'm just saying.
It's not so cut-and-dry.

133
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:23,166
We settled here for hundreds of years!

134
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,500
Good point.

135
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:28,133
None of my ancestors ever stepped
foot in this land. No, you're right.

136
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:30,246
Hey, don't walk away!

137
00:12:31,348 --> 00:12:33,816
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

138
00:12:33,984 --> 00:12:35,918
Hello, jackass.

139
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:42,859
You think you can oppress my people, landgrabber!

140
00:12:43,427 --> 00:12:46,658
But I will never disappear.

141
00:12:46,831 --> 00:12:49,891
No one can catch Phantom!

142
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,107
So let's go.

143
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:16,791
Very good.

144
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:49,491
Sorry. It's for the cause.

145
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,240
Zohan.

146
00:14:08,946 --> 00:14:12,109
Zohan, bring it.

147
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:29,261
Why you do this! I feel no pain.

148
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:32,800
No, no, no. I feel no pain.

149
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,428
- I feel no pain. This is too much...
- No, no, no. I feel no pain.

150
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:38,165
I have told you in other fights.

151
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:40,833
No, no, no. I kill you right now.

152
00:14:46,183 --> 00:14:48,151
Look, look, look.

153
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:55,425
The piranha, it looks very painful for you.

154
00:14:55,593 --> 00:14:57,356
Is good, is good.

155
00:14:57,528 --> 00:14:59,621
Is very nice. Yes, yes.

156
00:14:59,797 --> 00:15:01,992
Fizzy Bubblech for me.

157
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,135
You like what you see!

158
00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:12,468
Time to die.

159
00:15:12,643 --> 00:15:14,167
So let's go.

160
00:15:24,021 --> 00:15:26,546
Okay, game over.

161
00:15:45,976 --> 00:15:47,409
Yeah!

162
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,770
I kill!

163
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:54,250
I kill the Zohan!

164
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:56,077
Zohan is dead.

165
00:15:59,923 --> 00:16:02,050
The Phantom!

166
00:16:33,857 --> 00:16:36,985
Cutting the hair, this makes something beautiful.

167
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:39,152
Instead of shooting it.

168
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,423
That's why I had to fake to die.

169
00:16:41,598 --> 00:16:45,227
I could have captured Phantom again,
but for what! They trade him.

170
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,469
I love my country, but the fighting, it never ends.

171
00:16:50,441 --> 00:16:52,909
It's like Mr. Scrappy, you bite Coco.

172
00:16:53,077 --> 00:16:54,476
Coco, you bite him back.

173
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:58,809
Soon you are both having worms,
eating your own poopech...

174
00:17:02,853 --> 00:17:04,047
I understand. The pills.

175
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:06,781
Your parents think they know what's best for you.

176
00:17:06,957 --> 00:17:08,618
Sleep.

177
00:17:15,899 --> 00:17:18,697
It's all about not getting recognized.

178
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,803
I know how great I looked in the beard...

179
00:17:20,971 --> 00:17:23,804
but I'll make this work for me, you'll see.

180
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:41,487
Rise and shine, guys.
Good morning.

181
00:17:42,126 --> 00:17:43,718
Is nice, huh!

182
00:17:43,894 --> 00:17:45,327
It's the Avalon.

183
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:49,660
It says I care about the way I look,
but I'm still approachable.

184
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:53,199
Oh, you like this!

185
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,464
Who wants to go next, guys!
Who wants to look silky smooth!

186
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,699
Yes. Yes.

187
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:06,039
Oh, where are my two little babies!
Oh, come on.

188
00:18:06,216 --> 00:18:09,344
Come on out, Scrappy, come on out.
Come to Mama, Mr. Coco.

189
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:14,049
Mr. Scrappy. Coco.
What happened!

190
00:18:14,224 --> 00:18:16,249
Who gave you permission to do this, huh!

191
00:18:16,427 --> 00:18:18,019
Who did! Answer me.

192
00:18:18,195 --> 00:18:20,254
Scrappy, was it you!
It was you, wasn't it!

193
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:22,160
You're always the instigator.

194
00:18:22,332 --> 00:18:27,201
Bad dog. You are a very bad dog.
Never again are you gonna travel.

195
00:18:34,077 --> 00:18:36,841
Take me to the Paul Mitchell hair salon.

196
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:39,781
- First time in New York!
- Yes, my friend.

197
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:41,708
So, what brings you here!

198
00:18:41,885 --> 00:18:43,352
I have a dream.

199
00:18:44,021 --> 00:18:45,420
I had a dream too.

200
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:46,920
What dream you have!

201
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,921
My dream was to come to America...

202
00:18:49,092 --> 00:18:52,118
...and make enough money
to send for me brothers and sisters...

203
00:18:52,296 --> 00:18:54,560
...so that we all could enjoy freedom together.

204
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:56,756
- This is good dream.
- Oh, yes, it is.

205
00:18:56,934 --> 00:18:59,129
- Is dream come true!
- No, man.

206
00:18:59,303 --> 00:19:01,737
Me brothers and sisters were hacked to death.

207
00:19:01,905 --> 00:19:05,466
But I love the Chinese food here.
It's incredible.

208
00:20:15,546 --> 00:20:19,107
- Hey, you forgot these.
- Those are for you, my friend.

209
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:31,788
Good morning for you.
I am here to meet Mr. Paul Mitchell.

210
00:20:31,962 --> 00:20:33,054
And who are you!

211
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:38,490
Scrappy Coco.
I am here to take a job from him.

212
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:40,068
He isn't in right now.

213
00:20:40,237 --> 00:20:41,966
That's good. So I will wait, then.

214
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:48,569
You know what! I'll take one Fizzy Bubblech, a raspberry.

215
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:51,948
You know, he actually doesn't come in too often.

216
00:20:52,115 --> 00:20:54,811
Yes, just tell him I am perfect for this, so let's go.

217
00:20:54,985 --> 00:20:57,112
- I am the best.
- The best at what!

218
00:20:57,287 --> 00:21:01,189
All of this. The cutting, the styling,
the making it silky smooth.

219
00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:03,019
I wanna know who cuts your hair.

220
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,891
Oh, you like this, eh!

221
00:21:05,062 --> 00:21:07,997
This is the Avalon, straight from the Paul Mitchell book.

222
00:21:08,165 --> 00:21:12,261
I haven't seen that style since Luke married Laura.

223
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,197
Sister, are you this Laura!

224
00:21:16,673 --> 00:21:22,509
You tell Paul Mitchell, Scrappy Coco was here to see him.

225
00:21:23,614 --> 00:21:26,708
If I find out he was here...

226
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:29,716
...or you are keeping him hidden from me...

227
00:21:29,886 --> 00:21:31,717
...I will destroy you.

228
00:21:31,888 --> 00:21:34,118
Believe me this.

229
00:22:29,644 --> 00:22:32,306
What the hell was this, champ!
I'm not paying for that!

230
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,778
This asshole cut me off, made me swerve into you!

231
00:22:34,949 --> 00:22:37,782
With all due respect, I was in the bicycle lane.

232
00:22:37,952 --> 00:22:40,352
You came like a madman.
Be glad nobody was hurt.

233
00:22:40,522 --> 00:22:43,821
I mean, somebody could've died.
I mean, you came...

234
00:22:45,093 --> 00:22:47,584
Okay, real mature, sir. Real mature.

235
00:22:47,762 --> 00:22:50,424
You do not want to be throwing bicycles.

236
00:22:50,598 --> 00:22:52,930
Look, stay out of my business, Mustafa.

237
00:22:53,101 --> 00:22:56,264
"Mustafa"! This is not my name.
Who tells you this is my name!

238
00:22:56,438 --> 00:22:58,565
Whatever.
Salami, bologna, apple sauce.

239
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,764
Apple who!

240
00:22:59,941 --> 00:23:02,375
My friend, if I were you, I would change the tone.

241
00:23:02,544 --> 00:23:03,670
Avoid the pain.

242
00:23:03,845 --> 00:23:07,178
Listen, go back to your goddamned pretzel stand.
We got it...

243
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,814
- Look what I've got. It's right here.
- Please!

244
00:23:10,985 --> 00:23:12,452
- I've got it.
- Please, let me go.

245
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,386
I never work at pretzel stand.
You like to insult people!

246
00:23:17,892 --> 00:23:20,190
Was that your feet!

247
00:23:20,361 --> 00:23:22,124
Yes, it's the feet. The feet uppercut.

248
00:23:23,565 --> 00:23:24,827
Here comes the double foot.

249
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,167
This is good.

250
00:23:27,335 --> 00:23:30,304
Smell it, smell it, smell it.
Now take it.

251
00:23:30,472 --> 00:23:32,531
- That's for you.
- All right, let me go!

252
00:23:32,707 --> 00:23:34,732
You said you wanted pretzel!

253
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:38,969
Okay, I'm good.

254
00:23:39,147 --> 00:23:40,580
Beautiful.

255
00:23:40,749 --> 00:23:42,216
You want some chickens!

256
00:23:42,383 --> 00:23:44,317
No, no, no. I fix for you.

257
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:51,922
It's all b'seder.

258
00:23:52,093 --> 00:23:54,186
What are you, bionic!

259
00:23:54,362 --> 00:23:57,195
No, no, no. I only like the girls.

260
00:23:58,366 --> 00:24:00,425
Thanks, anyways.

261
00:24:04,906 --> 00:24:07,500
This is ridiculous traffic.

262
00:24:07,675 --> 00:24:11,042
Anyway, George insisted we have the party.

263
00:24:11,212 --> 00:24:14,181
- I always get midnight shift.
- Excuse me! Could you keep it down, please!

264
00:24:14,349 --> 00:24:16,681
I no sleep, I no see World Series Poker.

265
00:24:16,851 --> 00:24:19,012
Are you even watching the road!

266
00:24:19,187 --> 00:24:23,089
Be nice. He could be a terrorist.

267
00:24:23,258 --> 00:24:27,752
- Why Hamdi no get no midnight!
- Could you at least change the station!

268
00:24:33,168 --> 00:24:35,363
- Hey, that was amazing.
- Oh, yes.

269
00:24:35,537 --> 00:24:37,129
Where are you from, anyway!

270
00:24:37,305 --> 00:24:39,466
Where am I from!

271
00:24:39,641 --> 00:24:40,801
Australia.

272
00:24:40,975 --> 00:24:43,034
Really!
Because you sound Middle Eastern.

273
00:24:43,211 --> 00:24:45,008
No, no, no. Similar accents.

274
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,910
- Kangaroo. You see!
- Sure.

275
00:24:49,984 --> 00:24:52,111
This is ridiculous. We're getting out.

276
00:24:52,287 --> 00:24:55,120
- Come on, dear.
- I've been working longer than Hamdi.

277
00:24:57,025 --> 00:24:59,357
- You want me to get you home!
- No, I'll grab a cab.

278
00:24:59,527 --> 00:25:01,461
You've done enough.
That was crazy.

279
00:25:01,629 --> 00:25:03,722
Whose lockzie do I have to schluck?

280
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,698
Oh, you know you're boning me.
I don't know that.

281
00:25:10,171 --> 00:25:11,229
It's you.

282
00:25:13,274 --> 00:25:15,265
- What is happening!
- What's happening!

283
00:25:15,443 --> 00:25:16,774
It's bullshaklaga.

284
00:25:16,945 --> 00:25:18,242
- We have to go.
- Go where!

285
00:25:18,413 --> 00:25:20,176
- I'll run you.
- What are you doing!

286
00:25:20,348 --> 00:25:22,441
This is legal!

287
00:25:26,688 --> 00:25:30,124
Scrappy, have another kneidlach.
Come on.

288
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:31,758
You're very nice, Mrs. Klayman.

289
00:25:31,926 --> 00:25:35,692
It reminds me of my mother's cooking in Australia.

290
00:25:35,864 --> 00:25:39,356
Really!
It's funny, you don't sound Australian.

291
00:25:39,534 --> 00:25:42,697
Yes, no, no, no.
This is because I am half Australian...

292
00:25:42,871 --> 00:25:45,362
...half Mount Everest.

293
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,838
So this is what you're hearing.

294
00:25:48,943 --> 00:25:52,071
Well, Australia, it must be really nice there...

295
00:25:52,247 --> 00:25:54,306
...since they got rid of the apartheid.

296
00:25:54,482 --> 00:25:56,507
Oh, yes, the weather is much cooler.

297
00:25:58,152 --> 00:26:01,383
So, Scrappy, I understand you cut hair.

298
00:26:02,156 --> 00:26:04,386
I will be working with Mr. Paul Mitchell...

299
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,027
...as soon as I find out where they are hiding him.

300
00:26:07,195 --> 00:26:10,028
Oh, Mom, Scrappy doesn't have a place to stay yet.

301
00:26:10,198 --> 00:26:11,256
- Really!
- Not yet.

302
00:26:11,432 --> 00:26:13,798
Well, actually, there's a nice one-bedroom...

303
00:26:13,968 --> 00:26:16,368
...that just opened up upstairs.

304
00:26:16,537 --> 00:26:19,131
Nice light, not huge.

305
00:26:19,307 --> 00:26:21,366
And they redid the kitchen very well.

306
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,576
- This could be good.
- Could be good.

307
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:27,878
Could be good.

308
00:26:37,492 --> 00:26:39,960
Hey, Mom, do you know where the detergent is!

309
00:26:40,128 --> 00:26:42,289
- That's very good.
- Oh, my God!

310
00:26:42,463 --> 00:26:43,725
What! What's the matter!

311
00:26:43,932 --> 00:26:46,127
What's the matter! That's my mom.

312
00:26:46,301 --> 00:26:48,394
- It's okay, Michael.
- I know it's your mother.

313
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:49,558
She's very beautiful.

314
00:26:49,737 --> 00:26:51,705
Michael, I haven't made sticky in two days.

315
00:26:51,873 --> 00:26:54,865
- What do you want from me!
- Couldn't you wait till I was asleep!

316
00:26:55,043 --> 00:26:56,806
- Or dead!
- No, Michael.

317
00:26:56,978 --> 00:26:58,673
You do... What's he doing now!

318
00:26:58,846 --> 00:27:01,314
Why'd that happen!
Why'd that happen!

319
00:27:01,482 --> 00:27:02,972
It's okay. Let me talk to him.

320
00:27:03,151 --> 00:27:04,812
Oh, I can't get up.

321
00:27:04,986 --> 00:27:07,682
No, no. You'll feel your legs again in two hours.

322
00:27:09,357 --> 00:27:10,654
Michael.

323
00:27:10,825 --> 00:27:13,658
Come on, this is nothing to feel bad about.

324
00:27:13,828 --> 00:27:15,921
Me sexing your mother.

325
00:27:16,097 --> 00:27:19,066
It's beautiful. It's natural.

326
00:27:19,233 --> 00:27:22,168
No, I didn't bring you home to do it with my mother.

327
00:27:22,337 --> 00:27:25,067
Why not, huh!
You don't want her to be happy!

328
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:27,639
Did you see her! Did you look at her!

329
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:30,141
I don't think I can ever look at her again.

330
00:27:30,311 --> 00:27:33,974
Michael, her face during the big bang-boom!

331
00:27:34,148 --> 00:27:35,308
You did not see!

332
00:27:35,483 --> 00:27:37,110
She was glowing.

333
00:27:37,285 --> 00:27:39,344
Patches. What are you...!

334
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,953
Michael, come on.

335
00:27:41,122 --> 00:27:43,113
They'll be plenty of time for you and me.

336
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:45,623
Tonight, I take you to disco, huh!
How's this!

337
00:27:45,793 --> 00:27:47,784
No, why would I wanna go to a disco tonight!

338
00:27:48,863 --> 00:27:51,024
Michael, you should go. It'd be fun!

339
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:53,030
You could use a little stank.

340
00:27:53,201 --> 00:27:56,261
Yes, you need your penachim to take a swim.

341
00:27:56,437 --> 00:27:59,133
Yeah, a little chicken of the sea.
It wouldn't hurt.

342
00:27:59,307 --> 00:28:02,572
Disco, disco.
Let's do this, Michael. Yes or no!

343
00:28:02,744 --> 00:28:04,041
Come on, you get to disco.

344
00:28:04,212 --> 00:28:06,544
- Okey, All right, fine, I'll go to the disco.
- Okay.

345
00:28:06,714 --> 00:28:09,410
I do your mother one more time, and then we go.

346
00:28:09,584 --> 00:28:11,518
- Wha...!
- Seconds already!

347
00:28:11,686 --> 00:28:13,381
Oh, yes.

348
00:28:18,826 --> 00:28:21,522
Hey. Look at this.

349
00:28:21,696 --> 00:28:24,893
This is what you need, man,
to let off a little steam, huh!

350
00:28:25,066 --> 00:28:28,763
How many times a day do you make sticky!
Two! Five! Twelve!

351
00:28:28,936 --> 00:28:32,167
How many times a day!
I've had sex once in my life.

352
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,036
It was at tennis camp.
It was awful.

353
00:28:35,209 --> 00:28:38,474
You're too picky, Michael.
Maybe that's the problem.

354
00:28:38,646 --> 00:28:41,774
Every weed in the desert is still a flower.

355
00:28:42,283 --> 00:28:45,081
Look at this. This a big one, eh!

356
00:28:45,253 --> 00:28:49,656
But look at the tits.
These will bounce nice for you.

357
00:28:49,824 --> 00:28:53,260
Your mother, she has huge poopeh.

358
00:28:53,428 --> 00:28:55,988
I mean, very wide.

359
00:28:56,164 --> 00:29:01,727
But what I see are two big, strong legs
wrapped around my head, squeezing.

360
00:29:01,903 --> 00:29:03,598
So who wants to get some poontachen?

361
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:09,203
- I wanna get some poontachen?
- Well, let's get some. Yes.

362
00:29:13,781 --> 00:29:15,715
It's good for you. Nice spinning.

363
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:21,283
This is what I'm talking about.
You play this.

364
00:29:21,456 --> 00:29:23,447
- I ain't playing this corny shit.
- No, no.

365
00:29:23,624 --> 00:29:25,785
I need to set the mood for my friend.

366
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,053
Get out, you Daisy Duke-wearing motherf...

367
00:29:38,606 --> 00:29:40,597
- Disco, disco.
- Good, good!

368
00:29:40,775 --> 00:29:42,470
- Disco, disco.
- Good, good!

369
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,480
Yes, hello. Hello.

370
00:29:57,658 --> 00:30:00,559
Hey, Zohan.

371
00:30:00,728 --> 00:30:02,252
Who you looking for!

372
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:05,228
It's okay, no one can hear me in disco, Zohan.

373
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:07,594
Can you believe the poontachat in this place!

374
00:30:07,768 --> 00:30:11,329
I'm not Zohan.
My name is Scrappy Coco, my friend.

375
00:30:11,506 --> 00:30:14,475
What!
Of course you are Zohan Dvir.

376
00:30:14,642 --> 00:30:18,043
They all think you dead in Israel.
I'm not going to tell.

377
00:30:18,212 --> 00:30:20,908
Tell what!
I don't know what you're talking about my freund.

378
00:30:21,082 --> 00:30:24,882
Zohan, it's okay.
Don't worry, I'm a huge fan.

379
00:30:25,052 --> 00:30:28,385
The way you took out Abdullah Meda in '94.

380
00:30:28,556 --> 00:30:33,289
And when you made Melami Benazir eat his own shit in '97.

381
00:30:33,461 --> 00:30:35,861
I can't believe I'm meeting you, man.

382
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,055
So, what the fachma are you doing here!

383
00:30:38,232 --> 00:30:39,631
Come with me.

384
00:30:40,668 --> 00:30:42,795
Look, I couldn't take all the fighting anymore.

385
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,370
- What's it all for!
- Are you crazy!

386
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,974
If I could blow a terrorist inside out like you...

387
00:30:48,142 --> 00:30:50,337
...this is all I would do. I'd never sleep.

388
00:30:50,511 --> 00:30:53,207
- This is exaggeration.
- No, it's not.

389
00:30:53,381 --> 00:30:57,647
You made Palami Habdallah's poodle sit on a live grenade.

390
00:30:57,818 --> 00:31:01,049
- You gotta show me how you did that.
- I don't remember. I was young.

391
00:31:01,222 --> 00:31:03,884
So tell me the truth.
Why are you in America!

392
00:31:05,092 --> 00:31:06,116
I no want to tell you.

393
00:31:06,594 --> 00:31:08,459
What! What! Come on.

394
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:13,396
You are the best, Zohan.
Whatever you say is good.

395
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:19,738
I want to be hairdresser.

396
00:31:20,608 --> 00:31:22,337
You a fagala?

397
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,000
I can't believe it.

398
00:31:24,178 --> 00:31:27,909
A great warrior, but also a fagala with the penachim.

399
00:31:28,082 --> 00:31:31,051
No, no, no. I like hair.

400
00:31:31,219 --> 00:31:33,813
Come on, man, I get you real job.

401
00:31:33,988 --> 00:31:36,718
You come by my shop tomorrow.

402
00:31:36,891 --> 00:31:39,086
Israeli electronics. Are you crazy!

403
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,991
- Everyone will recognize me.
- No, you don't look like same Zohan.

404
00:31:43,164 --> 00:31:44,461
You have silly haircut now.

405
00:31:44,632 --> 00:31:46,896
- I have what haircut!
- What!

406
00:31:47,068 --> 00:31:49,298
- You say I look silly!
- No, no. Who said this!

407
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,631
- You said this.
- No, no. Nobody say nothing.

408
00:31:53,374 --> 00:31:54,398
I don't need your job.

409
00:31:54,575 --> 00:31:58,807
I get my own job on my own at a big salon.
You will see.

410
00:32:01,082 --> 00:32:03,016
You ever cut a sister's hair before!

411
00:32:03,184 --> 00:32:07,086
Yes. Sister, brother, grandma, grandpa, the whole family.

412
00:32:07,255 --> 00:32:08,449
I'm good at this.

413
00:32:08,623 --> 00:32:10,682
Have you ever worked with dreads before!

414
00:32:14,996 --> 00:32:16,054
This is what you do.

415
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,494
No more. This creature slayed.

416
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:22,625
It's not a problem. Okay, he's got me.
He's got me. He's got me. Okay.

417
00:32:23,304 --> 00:32:25,829
Okay. So we blind him in the eyes.
We got you.

418
00:32:26,007 --> 00:32:28,032
And we finish him.

419
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:32,145
You back away, I take hold of him.
Go! Go! Go out! Go now!

420
00:32:32,313 --> 00:32:33,871
Go!

421
00:32:35,883 --> 00:32:39,341
This is hair. This is hair.

422
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,648
Oh, okay. The joke's on me, eh!

423
00:32:44,492 --> 00:32:48,053
A big part of our job here
is making this a fun experience.

424
00:32:48,229 --> 00:32:49,457
Of course, of course.

425
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:53,361
For a lot of kids, this is their first cut,
and it can be very frightening.

426
00:32:53,534 --> 00:32:56,697
- I can imagine.
- I don't want a haircut.

427
00:32:56,871 --> 00:32:58,463
Get away from me.

428
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:00,869
Let me go.

429
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:04,409
Young man, look what I found here.

430
00:33:04,578 --> 00:33:06,671
A nice balloon.

431
00:33:06,847 --> 00:33:09,077
Do you want it! It's right here.

432
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,442
You shouldn't jump around...

433
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:14,315
...when this nice woman's
holding a sharp pair of scissors.

434
00:33:14,822 --> 00:33:18,883
If you move, she could slip and
slice your jugular vein on accident.

435
00:33:19,393 --> 00:33:21,657
There's no way to stitch the jugular.

436
00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:24,821
All of your blood will be on the floor in four minutes.

437
00:33:25,266 --> 00:33:28,861
I've seen this. I've done this.
You don't want this.

438
00:33:39,914 --> 00:33:43,873
Well, then, at least it's a good time to shave his neck.
I would get him quick.

439
00:33:47,888 --> 00:33:50,652
When I was your age I already killed seven men.

440
00:33:50,825 --> 00:33:53,293
Maybe you should grow up.

441
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,784
I promise you you won't regret.

442
00:34:22,957 --> 00:34:25,187
And come back.

443
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,419
"Fujigawa"! I don't know that brand.
It really isn't...

444
00:34:28,596 --> 00:34:31,224
It's not really Fujigawa.
It's Sony guts.

445
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:35,335
- Wouldn't it be better with the Sony...
- Oh, no, no, no. This is what you want.

446
00:34:35,503 --> 00:34:38,597
- Four-hundred fifty.
- But the ad says "Sony," and "300."

447
00:34:38,773 --> 00:34:42,971
No, no, no. What you going to believe, me or the ad!
Four-fifty.

448
00:34:44,412 --> 00:34:47,313
Hello, Going Out of Business.
Can I help you!

449
00:34:47,481 --> 00:34:49,608
Sony, yes. Three hundred.

450
00:34:49,784 --> 00:34:51,752
Come in, yes. Very good, very good.

451
00:34:54,622 --> 00:34:57,056
Hi. I represent the new owner of this building.

452
00:34:57,224 --> 00:34:59,818
Good for you. Want a birthday cake!
What do you want!

453
00:34:59,994 --> 00:35:01,154
Yamaha is very good.

454
00:35:01,328 --> 00:35:03,489
Did you receive our letter regarding your rent!

455
00:35:03,664 --> 00:35:06,599
- This I don't know.
- It's being raised to 20,000 a month.

456
00:35:06,767 --> 00:35:08,098
No, no, no. This is too much.

457
00:35:08,269 --> 00:35:10,294
Eighty-five hundred is all we'll give you.

458
00:35:10,471 --> 00:35:13,531
- This isn't negotiable. We can get...
- Ten thousand, that's all.

459
00:35:13,707 --> 00:35:14,867
We both go home happy.

460
00:35:15,042 --> 00:35:17,738
- I'm sorry. We can't settle for less.
- Okay, no deal.

461
00:35:17,912 --> 00:35:19,709
You come back when you want to deal.

462
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,472
- Sir, you don't understand.
- Go.

463
00:35:21,649 --> 00:35:25,050
What you still here for! You like me!
I have girlfriend. Go.

464
00:35:25,219 --> 00:35:27,346
Thank you very much.

465
00:35:30,591 --> 00:35:34,049
Hey, look who's here.

466
00:35:34,228 --> 00:35:35,490
Come on, not so loud.

467
00:35:35,663 --> 00:35:39,190
Don't worry, Zohan.
I tell you, they don't recognize you.

468
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:43,268
Yosi. This is good man.
This Chocolaté Coco.

469
00:35:43,437 --> 00:35:46,133
- Scrappy Coco.
- Scrappy Coco.

470
00:35:46,307 --> 00:35:47,399
Cooking Who-co!

471
00:35:48,275 --> 00:35:49,537
Yes, yes.

472
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,234
So you're going out of business!

473
00:35:51,412 --> 00:35:54,575
No, no, no, no. Is just a sign.
Is good for business.

474
00:35:55,182 --> 00:35:59,312
Yeah, so you look me up, man.
That's cool.

475
00:35:59,487 --> 00:36:01,853
I come for job.

476
00:36:03,157 --> 00:36:06,422
Job. So you not big hairstyle!

477
00:36:07,995 --> 00:36:13,524
It's not really happening for me so far.

478
00:36:13,701 --> 00:36:16,534
So I am here. So let's go.

479
00:36:19,173 --> 00:36:21,437
No. No job.

480
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:23,702
What do you mean!
You tell me to come here.

481
00:36:23,878 --> 00:36:27,211
I can no let you do this.
You want to be hair homo.

482
00:36:27,381 --> 00:36:30,111
No, so I do this for now.
It's all yofi tofi.

483
00:36:30,284 --> 00:36:32,275
Is no now.

484
00:36:32,887 --> 00:36:38,621
Once you start in electronics store, you never get out.

485
00:36:40,261 --> 00:36:42,422
Look at Ephraim. You see!

486
00:36:42,596 --> 00:36:44,860
I don't see nothing wrong with that.
It's perfect.

487
00:36:45,032 --> 00:36:47,193
Ephraim came to America...

488
00:36:47,735 --> 00:36:51,136
...to be racing car driver.

489
00:36:51,972 --> 00:36:53,872
But he let slip away.

490
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:57,033
I can hear it. Look. Check your ear.

491
00:36:57,211 --> 00:37:02,376
Pinchas wanted to be the next Bill Cosby.

492
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:05,917
No. Is resistant, no proof.
You don't understand!

493
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:10,556
But the store kept pulling him back.

494
00:37:10,724 --> 00:37:12,316
Maybe you swimming with the watch.

495
00:37:12,493 --> 00:37:14,051
- I'm not swimming...
- Is resistant.

496
00:37:15,629 --> 00:37:20,396
Yosi wanted to be a hand model.

497
00:37:20,568 --> 00:37:23,503
What, you don't like this! Look at this.
This is most beautiful.

498
00:37:23,671 --> 00:37:25,298
But he got too comfortable here.

499
00:37:25,472 --> 00:37:28,498
Press this button, it's free HBO.

500
00:37:29,043 --> 00:37:33,878
The electronics store is a dream killer.

501
00:37:34,982 --> 00:37:39,646
And I won't let the Zohan kill his dream.

502
00:37:42,089 --> 00:37:46,025
<i>You are a real mensch, Oori.</i>

503
00:37:46,193 --> 00:37:49,560
<i>You the mensch.</i>

504
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:50,788
Come.

505
00:37:50,965 --> 00:37:52,023
What! What's this!

506
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:55,965
You may not go for this,
but this place cross the street...

507
00:37:56,136 --> 00:37:58,161
- Yes!
- They maybe take you.

508
00:37:58,772 --> 00:38:02,173
- Is good place!
- No, is dump, but they take you.

509
00:38:02,343 --> 00:38:04,470
Is on Palestinian side of street.

510
00:38:04,645 --> 00:38:05,942
Palestinian!

511
00:38:06,113 --> 00:38:09,446
No, no, no.
Look, nobody kill you there.

512
00:38:09,617 --> 00:38:10,879
Here nobody care.

513
00:38:11,051 --> 00:38:13,110
First off, no one kill me anywhere.

514
00:38:13,821 --> 00:38:16,085
But Palestinian, no.

515
00:38:16,256 --> 00:38:18,349
I've done enough to my parents already.

516
00:38:18,525 --> 00:38:20,823
I just want job for the Zohan.

517
00:38:20,995 --> 00:38:22,986
And it kills me the way Phantom bastard...

518
00:38:23,163 --> 00:38:26,030
...getting his buttochim kissed in Palestine now.

519
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,532
Buttochim kissed! What's this!

520
00:38:28,969 --> 00:38:30,231
He have business.

521
00:38:30,404 --> 00:38:32,304
He buy wives.

522
00:38:33,607 --> 00:38:34,972
Him!

523
00:38:35,142 --> 00:38:38,578
They say his ugly face everywhere.

524
00:38:39,146 --> 00:38:42,206
<i>Everyone is running To Phantom's Chewy Muchentuchen</i>

525
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:45,750
<i>For the food the heroes eat</i>

526
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,180
<i>Kubeh, sambouesk, Delicious muchentuchen</i>

527
00:38:49,356 --> 00:38:51,449
<i>You never know who you'll meet</i>

528
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:55,425
<i>You are going to get spoiled.</i>

529
00:39:01,535 --> 00:39:04,095
<i>Phantom Muchentuchen!</i>

530
00:39:04,271 --> 00:39:05,795
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

531
00:39:05,973 --> 00:39:08,066
<i>This month, order Muchentuchen Happy Lunch...</i>

532
00:39:08,242 --> 00:39:11,370
<i>... and get action figures from Phantom Presents:
Death to Zohan.</i>

533
00:39:15,015 --> 00:39:16,846
Unbelievable.

534
00:39:17,017 --> 00:39:22,045
This animal gets to live his dream.
But, me, l...

535
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:26,753
I can no work Palestinian, no.
It's like... I can't do this.

536
00:39:26,927 --> 00:39:28,292
Yes, you can.

537
00:39:28,462 --> 00:39:32,398
Is your dream to cut hair.
You want fight, or you want hair!

538
00:39:32,566 --> 00:39:35,797
I want hair. But I'm scared.

539
00:39:35,969 --> 00:39:38,767
Is America.
You can do anything here.

540
00:39:38,939 --> 00:39:42,534
You never done something people thought was impossible!

541
00:39:45,012 --> 00:39:47,947
So you don't want to talk, huh!
I'll make you talk.

542
00:40:07,735 --> 00:40:08,827
I can do this.

543
00:40:20,948 --> 00:40:22,438
<i>Disco, disco, good, good.</i>

544
00:40:22,616 --> 00:40:24,311
<i>Disco, disco, good, good.</i>

545
00:40:24,485 --> 00:40:26,214
<i>Disco, disco, good, good.</i>

546
00:40:26,386 --> 00:40:27,853
<i>Disco, disco, good, good.</i>

547
00:40:28,021 --> 00:40:29,784
<i>Disco, disco, good, good.</i>

548
00:40:31,658 --> 00:40:34,456
So you have never cut hair before.

549
00:40:34,628 --> 00:40:37,495
I have cut my own hair and several dogs.

550
00:40:38,165 --> 00:40:42,261
I have the Paul Mitchell book,
I have the stamina, the desire...

551
00:40:42,436 --> 00:40:44,802
But you have no training or experience.

552
00:40:44,972 --> 00:40:49,033
Would you hire someone with experience in something else!

553
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,534
In what!

554
00:40:50,911 --> 00:40:53,141
Can anyone here do this!

555
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,483
Okay. I have never seen that.

556
00:41:03,657 --> 00:41:06,455
That is very nice, but that is not going to help me.

557
00:41:06,627 --> 00:41:09,095
No hands.

558
00:41:09,263 --> 00:41:10,787
Besides, I have no openings.

559
00:41:10,964 --> 00:41:12,693
If anything, I need to scale back...

560
00:41:12,866 --> 00:41:15,357
...since they just raised my rent through the roof.

561
00:41:15,536 --> 00:41:20,098
Out of nowhere, some guy with a tie
comes in and tells me I need to pay.

562
00:41:20,274 --> 00:41:21,468
Stop it!

563
00:41:22,876 --> 00:41:25,743
I only wish to learn.

564
00:41:25,913 --> 00:41:28,245
I will do whatever it takes.

565
00:41:31,084 --> 00:41:34,645
Fine. You can sweep up hair a few shifts a week.

566
00:41:34,822 --> 00:41:36,813
- You won't be...
- No pay.

567
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:40,153
No, no, no.
But then, I will become stylist, yes!

568
00:41:40,761 --> 00:41:41,955
That could be a while.

569
00:41:42,129 --> 00:41:44,529
I will wait turn. You will see.

570
00:41:44,698 --> 00:41:47,929
I will get nighttime job for money.

571
00:41:48,101 --> 00:41:50,729
Soon the whole world will be silky smooth.

572
00:42:01,048 --> 00:42:02,072
Zohan.

573
00:42:02,249 --> 00:42:04,843
- Carmen Electra has the best tits now.
- Oh, please.

574
00:42:05,018 --> 00:42:08,044
Oh, my God.
I wonder how much she paid for them.

575
00:42:09,356 --> 00:42:11,586
They're so perky.

576
00:42:11,758 --> 00:42:14,727
You know, leave it to her to buy the best tits.

577
00:42:14,895 --> 00:42:17,329
It's always first class with that one.

578
00:42:17,497 --> 00:42:20,660
You know you don't have to catch
every piece of hair as it falls.

579
00:42:20,834 --> 00:42:25,203
Yes, I do. You deserve a perfect floor.
One single hair is unacceptable.

580
00:42:25,372 --> 00:42:26,396
As you were.

581
00:42:40,187 --> 00:42:41,950
Yes. I got this.

582
00:42:43,323 --> 00:42:45,689
"Did you see the new Kate Hudson movie!

583
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:48,919
I think she is even more vivacious than her mother."

584
00:42:49,096 --> 00:42:53,260
Scrappeleh, that's wonderful.
Now, let's practice on Michael.

585
00:42:53,433 --> 00:42:56,561
Michael!
Could you come in here, please!

586
00:42:57,337 --> 00:42:58,634
What! What is...!

587
00:42:58,805 --> 00:43:01,740
Oh, Scrappy needs to practice small-talking.

588
00:43:01,909 --> 00:43:05,276
Can we do this another time!
I have a shot at keeping my food down.

589
00:43:05,445 --> 00:43:07,003
Michael, I want to practice now.

590
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,115
I'm afraid I'm terrible at this.
Why won't you help me!

591
00:43:10,284 --> 00:43:15,278
Oh, honey.
You are good at everything you do.

592
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,375
- Got it.
- Thanks.

593
00:43:41,548 --> 00:43:43,743
So you're making her silky smooth, huh, Claude!

594
00:43:43,917 --> 00:43:47,148
- Framing her face!
- Yeah, Scrappy. I'm framing her face.

595
00:43:47,321 --> 00:43:48,481
This is smart.

596
00:43:48,655 --> 00:43:52,250
A nice layered style with the soft bangs...

597
00:43:52,426 --> 00:43:54,519
...is good for a bigger woman like this.

598
00:43:54,695 --> 00:43:56,890
- Coco.
- Takes the eyes off the moon face...

599
00:43:57,064 --> 00:43:58,827
...and brings it toward the titzim.

600
00:43:58,999 --> 00:44:00,830
Coco.

601
00:44:01,001 --> 00:44:02,195
I need to speak to you.

602
00:44:03,704 --> 00:44:04,966
In private.

603
00:44:06,106 --> 00:44:08,631
Private. A secret!

604
00:44:08,809 --> 00:44:11,209
They will never get it out of me, I promise you.

605
00:44:11,378 --> 00:44:14,575
Coco, Claude is trying to work.

606
00:44:14,748 --> 00:44:16,375
Yes. He's very good.

607
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:19,417
So I am ready to cut hair today.
So let's go, let's get it on.

608
00:44:19,586 --> 00:44:21,486
No. Let's not go.

609
00:44:21,655 --> 00:44:22,679
But I am the best.

610
00:44:22,856 --> 00:44:24,824
Don't tell me you're the best.

611
00:44:24,992 --> 00:44:27,756
- I have the desire, the stamina.
- You've been here two days.

612
00:44:27,928 --> 00:44:29,657
I run this place for five years.

613
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:32,594
I think I know when you are ready to cut hair.

614
00:44:32,766 --> 00:44:35,428
Okay, Jeez! Get a room, you two.

615
00:44:35,602 --> 00:44:37,627
No, no, no.

616
00:44:37,804 --> 00:44:40,739
I do not touch this with your penachim.

617
00:44:42,175 --> 00:44:43,870
Out of respect for the working.

618
00:44:44,211 --> 00:44:47,305
No, you don't eat where you shit.

619
00:44:47,481 --> 00:44:50,939
Or shit where you eat.
Whatever the...

620
00:44:51,118 --> 00:44:52,779
The smell is bad.

621
00:44:55,822 --> 00:44:57,084
This is called a comb.

622
00:44:59,092 --> 00:45:02,061
- With the fingers!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no.

623
00:45:03,597 --> 00:45:06,998
- Scrappy.
- I'm sorry. Here, I take your leg up.

624
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:08,862
I'm sorry about this. I'm sorry.

625
00:45:09,036 --> 00:45:11,095
- Okay. All right.
- I apologize.

626
00:45:11,271 --> 00:45:13,705
- Take him where he wants to go.
- Thank you. Okay.

627
00:45:13,874 --> 00:45:15,398
- Good luck.
- It will be fine.

628
00:45:15,575 --> 00:45:19,102
- Your limousine has arrived, sir.
- You're observant, Tyler.

629
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,677
Thank you, Big Mac.

630
00:45:21,848 --> 00:45:25,750
I am really late for a hotel opening downtown.
The Walbridge Hotel.

631
00:45:25,919 --> 00:45:29,082
I understand, sir.
I know the neighborhoods inside and backwards.

632
00:45:29,256 --> 00:45:31,588
- We will not let them stop us.
- What!

633
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:38,495
I'm not in much of a hurry.

634
00:45:42,102 --> 00:45:44,229
Oh, no.

635
00:45:47,507 --> 00:45:48,997
You want some coffee back there!

636
00:45:49,176 --> 00:45:50,575
No!

637
00:45:51,078 --> 00:45:52,272
I will lose them.

638
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,240
Nobody is following us.

639
00:46:01,988 --> 00:46:03,751
Oh, shit!

640
00:46:17,137 --> 00:46:19,002
Have a good time, sir.

641
00:46:23,043 --> 00:46:26,035
Debbie, you did a good job.

642
00:46:26,213 --> 00:46:29,580
You look very bangable, Mrs. Rosen.

643
00:46:30,417 --> 00:46:32,851
Mrs. Paulson, I must tell you...

644
00:46:33,019 --> 00:46:37,046
...when you first came in, you looked hideous.

645
00:46:37,224 --> 00:46:38,555
There was nothing attractive.

646
00:46:38,725 --> 00:46:43,753
<i>But now, I must say, my schtitzel, it's about to burst.</i>

647
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:46,626
- It could break these any...
- What are you doing!

648
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,564
We are talking shop.

649
00:46:49,736 --> 00:46:51,829
No. No.

650
00:46:52,572 --> 00:46:54,335
- Look, Coco...
- What!

651
00:46:54,508 --> 00:46:56,408
You need to calm down now, okay!

652
00:46:56,576 --> 00:46:59,374
I don't think these customers like the way you talk shop.

653
00:46:59,546 --> 00:47:00,672
Nobody say this.

654
00:47:00,847 --> 00:47:06,149
Coco, remember, respect for the workplace.

655
00:47:07,954 --> 00:47:09,888
I have betrayed my salon.

656
00:47:14,194 --> 00:47:15,491
He's trying to kill himself.

657
00:47:15,662 --> 00:47:16,993
- Scrappy.
- I deserve this.

658
00:47:17,164 --> 00:47:20,361
No, no. Just... Just...

659
00:47:20,934 --> 00:47:23,266
Easy on the ladies.

660
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:26,031
I didn't mind.

661
00:47:31,178 --> 00:47:33,043
Take care, Mrs. Paulson.

662
00:47:34,014 --> 00:47:36,039
She did not mind.

663
00:47:38,952 --> 00:47:42,080
Let me disinfect the scissors...

664
00:47:42,822 --> 00:47:47,521
...so someone else can make someone else silky smooth.

665
00:47:48,562 --> 00:47:50,393
I'll just clean up.

666
00:47:55,468 --> 00:47:57,527
Rafaela's Salon.

667
00:47:57,704 --> 00:47:59,638
What! No.

668
00:48:02,709 --> 00:48:03,937
Debbie, she quit.

669
00:48:04,711 --> 00:48:06,474
- What!
- Sorry.

670
00:48:06,947 --> 00:48:09,108
Claude, did you know about this!

671
00:48:09,282 --> 00:48:10,544
I should have told you.

672
00:48:10,717 --> 00:48:14,084
She's been looking for a new job
since those rent guys came around.

673
00:48:14,254 --> 00:48:16,620
Then why you no say nothing, little bitch!

674
00:48:18,525 --> 00:48:21,961
Don't worry, I'm not giving up on this place.

675
00:48:22,128 --> 00:48:25,393
<i>You're a good guy, habibi.
I just... I don't know what to do.</i>

676
00:48:30,537 --> 00:48:32,061
So let's go.

677
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:35,265
Scrappy, I have enough problems right now.

678
00:48:38,478 --> 00:48:40,844
I not the problem. I the solution. I fix.

679
00:48:41,014 --> 00:48:43,175
But if you screw up...

680
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:45,750
I can't afford a screw up right now.

681
00:48:45,919 --> 00:48:49,047
No, no, no. I no screw up.
I am the best for the job.

682
00:48:49,222 --> 00:48:51,986
Yeah, but you push and push.
"When is my turn"!

683
00:48:52,158 --> 00:48:53,750
I have to care about salon.

684
00:48:53,927 --> 00:48:55,258
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

685
00:48:55,428 --> 00:49:00,024
You care about you.
And don't fight in front of the customer.

686
00:49:02,769 --> 00:49:07,399
Mrs. Skitzer, I am afraid our stylist is out today.

687
00:49:07,574 --> 00:49:10,702
Would you care to wait for Claude!

688
00:49:12,112 --> 00:49:13,170
Does he do hair!

689
00:49:16,016 --> 00:49:19,315
He's not a regular.

690
00:49:19,486 --> 00:49:20,783
Well, that's fine.

691
00:49:23,156 --> 00:49:28,458
She say... I mean, only if it's okay with Dalia.

692
00:49:30,797 --> 00:49:32,059
Okay.

693
00:49:32,899 --> 00:49:38,030
You will not regret this decision.

694
00:49:41,541 --> 00:49:44,237
Mrs. Skitzer, let's cut your hair.

695
00:49:44,811 --> 00:49:48,406
Just lay back, Mrs. Skitzer.
I'll take care of everything.

696
00:49:48,882 --> 00:49:51,248
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

697
00:49:51,418 --> 00:49:54,216
Sexy woman like you deserves to be pampered.

698
00:49:54,387 --> 00:49:56,412
Me, sexy! Sure.

699
00:49:56,589 --> 00:49:57,613
Don't be humble.

700
00:49:57,791 --> 00:50:02,751
You've got the ass and tits
of a schoolgirl and you know it.

701
00:50:02,929 --> 00:50:06,126
And everyone else knows this too, believe me.

702
00:50:06,299 --> 00:50:07,857
Yes.

703
00:50:08,034 --> 00:50:09,934
Let me get your earring off.

704
00:51:59,379 --> 00:52:00,641
I love it.

705
00:52:00,814 --> 00:52:04,682
Of course you do.
I make you silky smooth. I tell you this.

706
00:52:05,251 --> 00:52:09,119
All right, Scrappy.
You can cut Debbie's clients today.

707
00:52:09,289 --> 00:52:11,883
If they want you.

708
00:52:16,563 --> 00:52:17,587
Thank you.

709
00:52:17,764 --> 00:52:21,325
I'll get to you all soon as I'm
all the way done with Mrs. Skitzer.

710
00:52:22,635 --> 00:52:24,125
That all you got, Mrs. Skitzer!

711
00:52:24,304 --> 00:52:28,468
Come on, baby. Go, baby. Yes. Yes.

712
00:52:47,861 --> 00:52:49,055
So who's next!

713
00:53:24,097 --> 00:53:26,588
Come on, Scrappy!

714
00:53:28,368 --> 00:53:30,802
Thank you, dear.

715
00:53:31,304 --> 00:53:35,331
- It's a lot of speakers.
- Yes. Yes.

716
00:53:39,012 --> 00:53:40,946
It's orgasmic.

717
00:53:41,114 --> 00:53:42,809
Oh, my God.

718
00:53:44,017 --> 00:53:45,985
Oh, yes!

719
00:54:00,433 --> 00:54:03,163
Grab it, Scrappy!

720
00:54:11,044 --> 00:54:13,638
For you. Yes.

721
00:54:18,851 --> 00:54:21,183
I give this to you.

722
00:54:29,028 --> 00:54:32,520
- No. I am sorry, Mr. Paul Mitchell.
- Hear me out, Scrappy, please.

723
00:54:32,699 --> 00:54:36,430
I'll give you stock options.
I'll name a shampoo after you.

724
00:54:36,603 --> 00:54:41,097
No, my loyalty is to here.
I will destroy you.

725
00:54:44,377 --> 00:54:47,642
I heard about this place from Joanne.

726
00:54:47,814 --> 00:54:50,146
You have to ask for Scrappy.

727
00:54:50,316 --> 00:54:53,308
Yes, is the primary cardholder present!

728
00:54:53,486 --> 00:54:54,510
Excuse me!

729
00:54:54,687 --> 00:54:57,417
Hello, I am calling from Spiegel catalogue.

730
00:54:57,590 --> 00:55:00,024
Are you between the ages of 18 and 39!

731
00:55:00,193 --> 00:55:01,990
We're trying to talk here.

732
00:55:02,161 --> 00:55:04,527
Have you ordered from catalogue in past six months!

733
00:55:04,697 --> 00:55:06,688
Could you get off the phone while you drive!

734
00:55:06,866 --> 00:55:09,664
Hey, what's the matter!
I trying to make a living, do my job.

735
00:55:09,836 --> 00:55:10,894
This is your job.

736
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:12,162
This is job also.

737
00:55:12,338 --> 00:55:13,362
This is not Iraq.

738
00:55:13,539 --> 00:55:15,769
I am Palestine, I'm not Iraq.

739
00:55:15,942 --> 00:55:17,273
And you're not getting a tip.

740
00:55:17,443 --> 00:55:19,172
And you are a stupid cow.

741
00:55:19,345 --> 00:55:20,369
Jeez.

742
00:55:20,546 --> 00:55:23,106
- And we're done. Okay, you, skedaddle.
- Thanks so much.

743
00:55:23,282 --> 00:55:25,682
- I'll see you later.
- All right.

744
00:55:26,285 --> 00:55:28,219
I like this, the red hair.

745
00:55:28,388 --> 00:55:31,653
I bet she has a pumpkin patch down below, yes!

746
00:55:31,824 --> 00:55:32,882
I don't know.

747
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:35,653
- Did you tap her tuchus?
- No.

748
00:55:35,828 --> 00:55:38,854
Why don't you go after the snatchacheem in this place!

749
00:55:39,032 --> 00:55:41,125
They all want you, believe me.

750
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,268
Scrappy, I wouldn't be so sure.

751
00:55:43,436 --> 00:55:45,768
I'm telling you, you're not picking up the signs.

752
00:55:46,439 --> 00:55:49,101
Come with me.
I'll show you a technique. It's beautiful.

753
00:55:49,275 --> 00:55:53,678
Hello, Mrs. Haynes. How are you!
You want the cut and color today!

754
00:55:53,846 --> 00:55:55,211
Yes, please. Thanks.

755
00:55:56,215 --> 00:55:57,239
Watch.

756
00:56:00,887 --> 00:56:03,947
You see! She's going with it.
It's good.

757
00:56:04,123 --> 00:56:05,283
Yep.

758
00:56:05,792 --> 00:56:08,590
- She has a free shoulder. Come join.
- I'm good.

759
00:56:09,762 --> 00:56:12,196
Mrs. Haynes, you're getting cold here.

760
00:56:12,365 --> 00:56:14,799
Claude, come. Keep her warm.

761
00:56:14,967 --> 00:56:16,628
Go ahead. Yes.

762
00:56:17,336 --> 00:56:21,932
And gently move.
Gently move the shoulder.

763
00:56:22,108 --> 00:56:24,906
All you want to do is let her know you're here for her.

764
00:56:25,462 --> 00:56:28,521
Now look away like you're not even doing it.

765
00:56:28,697 --> 00:56:30,631
We're not doing this.

766
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:32,097
- Same rhythm.
- Okay.

767
00:56:32,268 --> 00:56:34,633
Push. Push. Push.

768
00:56:36,439 --> 00:56:41,102
Oh, you're pushing harder.
It's starting to feel good on my end.

769
00:56:41,276 --> 00:56:44,940
I am trying to make money to start my own business, huh.

770
00:56:45,115 --> 00:56:47,674
Would you say you read Spiegel once a month, twice...

771
00:56:47,851 --> 00:56:49,715
Would you just get us to the hair salon!

772
00:56:49,885 --> 00:56:51,444
We're gonna miss our appointment.

773
00:56:51,621 --> 00:56:55,216
I curse you, and I curse your hair.

774
00:56:55,391 --> 00:56:58,758
What is big deal about this hair place anyway!

775
00:57:01,331 --> 00:57:02,855
They get worse every year.

776
00:57:09,873 --> 00:57:15,176
Okay, we'll take them to the truck.
We'll just talk to them. But we'll find a...

777
00:57:18,181 --> 00:57:21,811
Did you throw this shoe at me, my friend!

778
00:57:22,986 --> 00:57:24,317
No!

779
00:57:24,487 --> 00:57:27,047
Sure looks like it was you.

780
00:57:31,628 --> 00:57:33,893
Then who threw it!

781
00:57:37,233 --> 00:57:41,431
Okay. You're lucky I'm in good mood.
I'll let you off the hook.

782
00:57:42,907 --> 00:57:45,670
Nobody spits on me.

783
00:57:50,046 --> 00:57:52,948
Thank you for the goat, my friend.

784
00:57:53,117 --> 00:57:54,141
Yes.

785
00:57:55,152 --> 00:57:57,518
Goat!

786
00:57:57,688 --> 00:57:59,656
Goat.

787
00:57:59,823 --> 00:58:02,348
Goat!

788
00:58:02,526 --> 00:58:04,993
Goat!

789
00:58:05,829 --> 00:58:08,320
Goat.

790
00:58:08,499 --> 00:58:11,490
I said, "Can we have the receipt!"

791
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:15,230
Yes. Die in hell.

792
00:58:18,943 --> 00:58:20,171
Welcome.

793
00:58:23,781 --> 00:58:26,978
We'll color your hair Bling-Bling Blond.
This is what you need.

794
00:58:27,151 --> 00:58:29,142
You know what else they go for!

795
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:33,154
The... I don't know what you have,
but mine is the biggest.

796
00:58:33,324 --> 00:58:35,849
This...
It does not get bigger than this.

797
00:58:36,026 --> 00:58:39,258
It's enormous. Scary. I mean:

798
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:40,590
What!

799
00:58:41,032 --> 00:58:43,626
I have the biggest. It's the biggest.

800
00:58:43,801 --> 00:58:45,463
Take a look at this.

801
00:58:45,637 --> 00:58:47,628
Look.

802
00:58:50,374 --> 00:58:52,604
- It's not that big.
- It's not that...!

803
00:58:52,776 --> 00:58:53,937
No, no, no. The bush.

804
00:58:54,545 --> 00:58:56,207
The bush is the biggest.

805
00:58:56,381 --> 00:58:58,871
And the girls like this because it's cushion.

806
00:59:00,385 --> 00:59:04,719
<i>It is no bullshaklaga. He is the one.
I never forget a face.</i>

807
00:59:04,889 --> 00:59:06,550
So, what do you want I do!

808
00:59:07,092 --> 00:59:08,992
Wait. I conference you.

809
00:59:11,062 --> 00:59:12,085
Hello!

810
00:59:12,264 --> 00:59:15,290
Nasi, emergency meeting.
You're on with Hamdi as well.

811
00:59:15,467 --> 00:59:17,401
- Hello, Nasi.
- Hello, Hamdi.

812
00:59:17,569 --> 00:59:19,969
Can you believe how much they pay Delgado!

813
00:59:20,138 --> 00:59:23,369
Yes. Why Mets do this!

814
00:59:24,142 --> 00:59:27,168
This is serious. We meet!

815
00:59:27,345 --> 00:59:30,007
I explain why is emergency.

816
00:59:30,181 --> 00:59:32,979
This is not just man who take my goat.

817
00:59:35,388 --> 00:59:38,481
- Zohan Dvir.
- Yes.

818
00:59:38,657 --> 00:59:40,784
Everyone think Phantom kill him.

819
00:59:40,959 --> 00:59:42,324
Phantom not kill him.

820
00:59:42,494 --> 00:59:46,124
We will capture, then make trade with Israel.

821
00:59:46,298 --> 00:59:48,459
We will be heroes.

822
00:59:48,633 --> 00:59:52,331
But, Salim, we are not Jihadim.
We don't know for sure that this is him.

823
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:55,405
Let's call Hamas, Hezbollah.
Let them handle this.

824
00:59:55,573 --> 00:59:57,598
- Leave it to the pros.
- No.

825
00:59:57,776 --> 00:59:59,175
Hezbollah shmezbollah.

826
00:59:59,344 --> 01:00:03,213
Hezbollah will take all the credit.
This is our shot.

827
01:00:03,382 --> 01:00:05,316
Why not let Phantom capture him!

828
01:00:05,484 --> 01:00:08,681
Screw Phantom. He hero already.

829
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:12,554
Where's my chain of muchentuchen restaurants!

830
01:00:13,993 --> 01:00:16,722
Salim, don't make this about yourself.

831
01:00:16,895 --> 01:00:18,363
This is about me.

832
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:20,158
And about him.

833
01:00:20,333 --> 01:00:22,301
And about my goat!

834
01:00:23,034 --> 01:00:25,595
Come on, let's go!

835
01:00:25,771 --> 01:00:29,172
This is nice, the walking inside the outside.

836
01:00:29,341 --> 01:00:32,903
The park, the people, the horses, the kid.

837
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:34,910
Well, you're always downtown.

838
01:00:35,081 --> 01:00:37,174
You should see a little more of New York.

839
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:39,318
Yes, yes, this is good.

840
01:00:39,485 --> 01:00:41,043
The talking is good...

841
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,916
...to get to know each other before the bang-boom. I like.

842
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:47,958
Oh, no, no, no.
There will be no bang-booming.

843
01:00:48,127 --> 01:00:51,494
I just wanted to thank you for saving my business.

844
01:00:51,664 --> 01:00:54,656
- This isn't a date.
- No, no, no.

845
01:00:54,835 --> 01:00:58,031
I feel you have helped me so much...

846
01:00:58,204 --> 01:01:00,468
The right thing to do is to tap you so hard...

847
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:03,836
<i>...my schtitzel will come out your poopech.
That's what I think.</i>

848
01:01:04,009 --> 01:01:07,035
Look, why don't we just enjoy the park!

849
01:01:07,213 --> 01:01:09,375
No, no, no. This is what we do.

850
01:01:10,916 --> 01:01:13,350
Hey, look, softball.

851
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,455
- You like softball!
- Of course, I love softball.

852
01:01:16,622 --> 01:01:20,423
What is softball! Teach me how to.

853
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:23,187
I learned softball when I came to the States.

854
01:01:23,362 --> 01:01:25,922
When you're Arab, it helps to fit in.

855
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,032
Yeah, how long you move here ago!

856
01:01:28,201 --> 01:01:30,134
Just a few years ago.

857
01:01:30,303 --> 01:01:34,740
I couldn't take it there anymore.
All the hate, on both sides.

858
01:01:34,908 --> 01:01:36,967
Yes, especially yours.

859
01:01:37,144 --> 01:01:40,045
Why you say this! You don't know.

860
01:01:40,213 --> 01:01:42,443
No, no, I don't. I read this.

861
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:46,985
The Australian-Tibet media is very biased.

862
01:01:47,154 --> 01:01:50,715
Look, both sides crazy.

863
01:01:50,891 --> 01:01:52,256
My own family...

864
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,984
My brother...

865
01:01:55,162 --> 01:02:00,566
...if he knew I work cross street from Israelis,
he would lose it.

866
01:02:00,734 --> 01:02:04,329
- Really!
- You have the hardcores on both sides.

867
01:02:04,504 --> 01:02:06,938
They just want to fight and fight.

868
01:02:07,107 --> 01:02:10,305
Nobody will win this way.
It has to stop.

869
01:02:11,578 --> 01:02:14,843
When will it end, eh! Yes.

870
01:02:16,584 --> 01:02:20,417
Okay, so you must be thirsty, no!

871
01:02:20,922 --> 01:02:22,856
Here.

872
01:02:23,024 --> 01:02:25,015
Where you get this!

873
01:02:25,193 --> 01:02:27,627
This! From specialty shop on West Side.

874
01:02:27,794 --> 01:02:31,322
This Middle Eastern drink.
You know this! Fizzy Bubblech!

875
01:02:31,499 --> 01:02:34,661
No, no, no. It looks pretty good.

876
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:37,703
Oh, try, try. It's very good.
Try, have a sip.

877
01:02:41,943 --> 01:02:43,034
It's not for me.

878
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:45,110
No! Really!

879
01:02:48,716 --> 01:02:51,014
This is his shop.

880
01:02:51,185 --> 01:02:53,550
Here is photo for compare.

881
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:56,281
For how long this take!
I close the newsstand.

882
01:02:57,658 --> 01:03:01,219
Make sure you ask him if he ever hit by shoe.

883
01:03:01,395 --> 01:03:06,560
And about the prize goat
that can fetch a bowl of onion soup.

884
01:03:07,168 --> 01:03:11,002
Look in his eyes when you ask him this,
for they will be suffering.

885
01:03:11,172 --> 01:03:13,402
- You know, I just got haircut.
- Go.

886
01:03:14,843 --> 01:03:19,643
Look at this. I feel like Hugh Hefner with
all you little bunnies around here.

887
01:03:22,583 --> 01:03:26,679
Okay, okay, let's see who is going next.

888
01:03:27,923 --> 01:03:32,019
"Jorge Posada," where are you!

889
01:03:32,194 --> 01:03:33,353
That's me.

890
01:03:34,962 --> 01:03:37,760
Okay, good-looking guy, you take a seat there.
You're next.

891
01:03:38,433 --> 01:03:40,900
You know, you look like you already just got haircut.

892
01:03:41,936 --> 01:03:43,995
No, no.

893
01:03:44,172 --> 01:03:48,039
So I guessing you're looking for
something in the silky smooth area!

894
01:03:48,209 --> 01:03:51,509
- Well...
- Because I see you have nice curls.

895
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:54,273
You don't want to cut into those curls.

896
01:03:54,448 --> 01:03:56,382
We will talk about this over there.

897
01:03:56,551 --> 01:04:00,989
Okay, Scrappy, I wait.

898
01:04:01,156 --> 01:04:03,750
Is not like I have a shoe to throw.

899
01:04:05,026 --> 01:04:06,857
Sure. Yes. Beautiful. Whatever.

900
01:04:07,028 --> 01:04:11,192
I don't have time to go watch a goat fetch soap.

901
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,060
- What!
- What! I don't know.

902
01:04:15,237 --> 01:04:16,636
Listen, my friend...

903
01:04:16,805 --> 01:04:19,740
...you want to talk, it's good,
but you have to wait your turn.

904
01:04:19,908 --> 01:04:22,035
First I have to cut and bang Mrs. Greenhouse.

905
01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:24,235
- That's right.
- Okay.

906
01:04:28,784 --> 01:04:30,479
Well, I'm ready for it.

907
01:04:30,652 --> 01:04:32,847
Oh, dear.

908
01:04:34,324 --> 01:04:38,954
I am sorry, Mrs. Greenhouse.
I am not man enough for you today.

909
01:04:39,127 --> 01:04:41,891
Oh, Scrappy, it's fine.

910
01:04:42,064 --> 01:04:45,898
I don't know what the problem is.
I am going to lose business.

911
01:04:46,068 --> 01:04:49,970
Oh, no, dear. You're still adorable.

912
01:04:50,138 --> 01:04:52,902
The screwing was really just a bonus.

913
01:04:53,776 --> 01:04:57,267
You are an angel, Mrs. Greenhouse.

914
01:04:57,047 --> 01:05:00,141
An angel with a magic throat.

915
01:05:00,316 --> 01:05:02,182
Oh, Scrappy!

916
01:05:03,486 --> 01:05:06,921
No, that could work.
One more, please.

917
01:05:07,089 --> 01:05:08,682
Let's see what we got.

918
01:05:08,857 --> 01:05:11,018
And we're still nothing.

919
01:05:23,506 --> 01:05:24,530
Well!

920
01:05:24,708 --> 01:05:26,699
He was very cool.

921
01:05:26,876 --> 01:05:28,901
Idiot. What did he say!

922
01:05:29,546 --> 01:05:33,949
He think I have nice curls that go well with a full face.

923
01:05:34,117 --> 01:05:37,280
- But was it him!
- Well, it looked like him.

924
01:05:37,454 --> 01:05:38,921
But hard to know.

925
01:05:39,089 --> 01:05:43,788
I tell you this: he didn't seem to care
when I talk about goat fetching soap.

926
01:05:44,828 --> 01:05:49,562
Soup. The goat fetched soup.
You ruin everything.

927
01:05:49,733 --> 01:05:51,725
Soup! This makes no sense.

928
01:05:51,901 --> 01:05:54,802
Screw you. It's him. I know it's him.

929
01:05:54,971 --> 01:05:58,566
The goat fetched soup!
This is unbelievable.

930
01:05:58,742 --> 01:06:01,074
Go to hell.

931
01:06:01,745 --> 01:06:02,973
You said it was urgent!

932
01:06:03,146 --> 01:06:06,344
It's an emergency.
Please, take a look.

933
01:06:07,651 --> 01:06:08,676
Yes, yes.

934
01:06:09,586 --> 01:06:13,522
Well, that's not a real problem.
You can always shave it.

935
01:06:14,592 --> 01:06:16,617
No, not the bush.

936
01:06:16,794 --> 01:06:20,753
No, inside the bush.
Look deeper. Him.

937
01:06:20,931 --> 01:06:23,161
- I see.
- He lays in there all day long.

938
01:06:23,334 --> 01:06:27,395
Maybe it needs some more oxygen.
It looks like it's being strangled.

939
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,533
So the Palestinian says to the priest:

940
01:06:31,709 --> 01:06:34,973
"Okay, but let's skip the bath."

941
01:06:36,213 --> 01:06:38,044
Why, are they not clean!

942
01:06:38,215 --> 01:06:39,546
No, is good joke.

943
01:06:40,918 --> 01:06:44,046
Honey, are you all right!
You've been in there for over an hour.

944
01:06:44,221 --> 01:06:48,590
What is this stuff! I mean, I took one
sip and I repainted the whole toilet.

945
01:06:48,759 --> 01:06:51,319
Is Fizzy Bubblech.
You'll get used to it, relax.

946
01:06:51,495 --> 01:06:53,986
I don't wanna get used to it.
My car couldn't.

947
01:06:56,201 --> 01:06:59,533
- All right, that's it for me. I'm done.
- What! What!

948
01:06:59,704 --> 01:07:01,103
Is everything all right, scrappy?

949
01:07:01,272 --> 01:07:03,331
- Is it about the pee-pee!
- Stop it.

950
01:07:03,507 --> 01:07:06,169
<i>- The pee-pee!
- He can't do with his peepeechosetz.</i>

951
01:07:06,344 --> 01:07:09,836
Really!
He's usually as hard as trigonometry.

952
01:07:10,014 --> 01:07:12,380
- Mom. What...!
- When did this happen!

953
01:07:13,118 --> 01:07:14,641
The last few days.

954
01:07:14,819 --> 01:07:18,050
Of course. It's ever since you went out with that Dalia.

955
01:07:19,324 --> 01:07:24,023
Your hog is telling you something.
She must be the one.

956
01:07:24,196 --> 01:07:26,720
The one!

957
01:07:26,897 --> 01:07:28,229
Is this possible!

958
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,061
Of course it's possible, man.

959
01:07:31,235 --> 01:07:35,433
<i>All the beaverim in the world
and he falls for Palestinian muffich.</i>

960
01:07:36,074 --> 01:07:38,338
Why should Scrappy careif she's Palestinian!

961
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:41,774
He's from Australia and Tibet.
He's not Israeli.

962
01:07:41,946 --> 01:07:43,278
- No, no, no.
- Oh, no, no, no.

963
01:07:45,751 --> 01:07:47,048
Exactly.

964
01:07:47,219 --> 01:07:48,811
What was that, a motor boat!

965
01:07:48,987 --> 01:07:50,215
You know, Scrappy...

966
01:07:50,388 --> 01:07:55,520
...a special woman is special no matter where she's from.

967
01:07:55,694 --> 01:07:57,958
Listen to your hog.

968
01:07:58,730 --> 01:08:02,166
Someone special.

969
01:08:02,334 --> 01:08:03,460
Maybe is good.

970
01:08:03,635 --> 01:08:05,762
It's good! It's terrific!

971
01:08:06,605 --> 01:08:09,439
I mean, you know, you guys won't be together anymore...

972
01:08:09,609 --> 01:08:12,076
...but Scrappy is in love.
That's great, awesome.

973
01:08:12,811 --> 01:08:14,403
Thank you for your support, young man.

974
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:16,171
- Is a good boy.
- Good boy.

975
01:08:16,348 --> 01:08:19,044
This is fun. Let's celebrate.
Where's the cat!

976
01:08:19,217 --> 01:08:21,845
Let's cat-sack, huh! Throw it to me.

977
01:08:22,021 --> 01:08:24,716
- Got you.
- Let's play, man.

978
01:08:27,492 --> 01:08:29,119
Take it, Michael.

979
01:08:33,865 --> 01:08:34,992
Look at you.

980
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:40,869
I wanna try it.

981
01:08:48,247 --> 01:08:49,373
Is good.

982
01:08:51,818 --> 01:08:53,649
<i>Welcome to Hezbollah phone line.</i>

Great.

991
01:09:21,514 --> 01:09:23,880
Come on. Just think of a bomb.

992
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:28,350
They say you can make bomb from everyday's material.
You combine.

993
01:09:28,521 --> 01:09:31,547
Yes, okay.
But what we combination!

994
01:09:33,527 --> 01:09:35,050
Just think of chemicals.

995
01:09:35,229 --> 01:09:37,823
Chemicals, like in science class.

996
01:09:37,997 --> 01:09:39,898
Yes.

997
01:09:45,204 --> 01:09:48,231
Who remembers this stuff!

998
01:09:51,043 --> 01:09:52,102
Hello.

999
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:54,907
Well, can I help you fellas find anything!

1000
01:09:55,082 --> 01:09:58,540
Yes, do you have...

1001
01:10:00,554 --> 01:10:05,287
..."liquid nitrogen."

1002
01:10:06,492 --> 01:10:08,119
You need what!

1003
01:10:08,294 --> 01:10:12,959
Liquid nitrogen.

1004
01:10:14,634 --> 01:10:18,435
Yeah. Well, I suppose we have some of that.

1005
01:10:18,605 --> 01:10:19,867
Now, just a moment.

1006
01:10:26,246 --> 01:10:29,443
- This is it!
- Yes, and that's the large container.

1007
01:10:30,751 --> 01:10:32,309
This works!

1008
01:10:32,486 --> 01:10:34,147
Oh, it works quite well. Yes.

1009
01:10:35,455 --> 01:10:36,479
You use!

1010
01:10:36,657 --> 01:10:40,116
From time to time. Sure.

1011
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:46,667
We'll take 12.

1012
01:10:47,668 --> 01:10:50,604
Look, you can turn off the water...

1013
01:10:50,772 --> 01:10:53,569
...but we will find a way to keep on going.

1014
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:55,799
Oh, you like when I spray you, Mrs. Skitzer!

1015
01:10:55,976 --> 01:10:57,773
Where's the $ 14,000!

1016
01:10:58,345 --> 01:11:02,247
I have your rent right here.
There is no getting rid of me.

1017
01:11:02,416 --> 01:11:03,850
We don't wanna get rid of you.

1018
01:11:04,018 --> 01:11:08,454
Mr. Walbridge would actually like to
relocate your salon in our new mall.

1019
01:11:08,622 --> 01:11:11,854
You mean the one you want to destroy
this community to build!

1020
01:11:12,026 --> 01:11:14,494
It is not our intent to destroy this community.

1021
01:11:15,362 --> 01:11:19,766
I'll take the community, Pancake.

1022
01:11:19,934 --> 01:11:23,199
My name is Gray, and I'll be back.

1023
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:25,633
Nice to meet you, Pancake.

1024
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:30,434
Why Pancake!

1025
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:32,303
Just for fun.

1026
01:11:33,081 --> 01:11:35,049
You were amazing right there.

1027
01:11:38,186 --> 01:11:39,210
Oh, my God.

1028
01:11:39,387 --> 01:11:41,412
What!

1029
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:43,352
I have one.

1030
01:11:43,858 --> 01:11:44,951
What!

1031
01:11:45,126 --> 01:11:47,617
<i>I have zikpah.</i>

1032
01:11:47,795 --> 01:11:48,989
Look at it.

1033
01:11:50,298 --> 01:11:53,062
It is you.

1034
01:11:53,835 --> 01:11:57,896
Dalia, I don't know how to tell you this.
I cannot make sticky with anyone else.

1035
01:11:58,973 --> 01:12:01,875
You are the special one.

1036
01:12:02,044 --> 01:12:05,501
I will only be stiff for you.

1037
01:12:06,814 --> 01:12:08,339
Who is Steve!

1038
01:12:08,517 --> 01:12:10,916
Stiff, with an F.

1039
01:12:13,421 --> 01:12:16,049
- Stiff. Stiff.
- Yes.

1040
01:12:16,659 --> 01:12:18,250
Okay...

1041
01:12:18,427 --> 01:12:22,419
...I know you meant that in a good way...

1042
01:12:22,598 --> 01:12:23,825
The best of ways.

1043
01:12:23,998 --> 01:12:26,432
so thank you.

1044
01:12:26,601 --> 01:12:28,728
Thank you.

1045
01:12:30,072 --> 01:12:31,699
Is crazy.

1046
01:12:31,874 --> 01:12:35,173
This has never happened.

1047
01:12:35,344 --> 01:12:36,935
One woman...

1048
01:12:37,111 --> 01:12:39,307
<i>...one zikpah...</i>

1049
01:12:39,481 --> 01:12:41,175
...one life.

1050
01:13:04,541 --> 01:13:07,668
You see his face!
Scared Israeli son of bitch.

1051
01:13:07,843 --> 01:13:09,811
Salim, this is not bomb.

1052
01:13:09,978 --> 01:13:11,343
What you mean "not bomb"!

1053
01:13:11,513 --> 01:13:14,141
It's grade A liquid nitrogen.

1054
01:13:14,316 --> 01:13:16,011
Guys, I really need to go home.

1055
01:13:16,185 --> 01:13:18,346
Inaz have a soccer match in the morning.

1056
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:22,012
- I am hero.
- Salim, this not bomb. It just go:

1057
01:13:22,191 --> 01:13:23,989
Well, just go with it.

1058
01:13:26,129 --> 01:13:27,756
I scraped some off the window.

1059
01:13:28,430 --> 01:13:29,728
Maybe you know what is!

1060
01:13:35,537 --> 01:13:39,998
It's Neosporin, it's nothing.
I use it for cuts and genital sores.

1061
01:13:43,213 --> 01:13:45,908
We're beginning to think
maybe someone out to get the Zo...

1062
01:13:46,081 --> 01:13:47,912
The Scrappy.

1063
01:13:48,083 --> 01:13:51,679
You mean like a competing salon!
That's heavy.

1064
01:13:51,855 --> 01:13:54,756
Don't be afraid, honey.
Don't be afraid.

1065
01:13:54,924 --> 01:13:56,653
Well, I...

1066
01:13:58,161 --> 01:14:00,857
Yeah, lick this.
No, she likes the tongue in the ear.

1067
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:03,055
Oh, I like that bet... Oh, I like that.

1068
01:14:03,233 --> 01:14:05,326
<i>Close with the brenski.</i>

1069
01:14:07,737 --> 01:14:10,137
Come on, get some saliva on those bad boys.

1070
01:14:10,306 --> 01:14:12,467
- She likes it, huh!
- Of course she likes it.

1071
01:14:12,642 --> 01:14:13,973
Okay.

1072
01:14:14,144 --> 01:14:17,204
I could look for clues.
It's my shift for community night watch.

1073
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:19,109
The what!
The communism tight crotch!

1074
01:14:19,282 --> 01:14:21,250
Oh, it's the community night watch program.

1075
01:14:21,417 --> 01:14:25,285
You know, people in the neighborhood patrolling it,
keeping it safe.

1076
01:14:25,455 --> 01:14:27,218
We kick some ass.

1077
01:14:27,390 --> 01:14:30,326
Hey, why don't you let Scrappy Coco
take your shift tonight!

1078
01:14:30,494 --> 01:14:32,894
- I bet he'd be good at this.
- Oori.

1079
01:14:33,496 --> 01:14:35,464
What! For clues.

1080
01:14:35,632 --> 01:14:40,228
I know it sounds scary, Scrappy,
but you are gonna be just fine.

1081
01:14:41,105 --> 01:14:43,232
Maybe I can manage one night.

1082
01:14:43,407 --> 01:14:45,136
Maybe you can pretzel some people.

1083
01:14:45,309 --> 01:14:48,334
- Thank you for getting the hummus.
- The hummus.

1084
01:14:48,979 --> 01:14:50,468
Where's Patches!

1085
01:14:50,647 --> 01:14:52,410
Patches.

1086
01:14:55,986 --> 01:14:58,977
I'm terrified right now.
I'm totally terrified.

1087
01:14:59,155 --> 01:15:01,453
"Shitting my pants" doesn't come close.

1088
01:15:01,625 --> 01:15:03,718
I wish I was shitting my pants.

1089
01:15:03,894 --> 01:15:05,759
It's just a patrol.

1090
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:07,227
What if something goes down!

1091
01:15:07,397 --> 01:15:09,592
I don't know if I'd have the courage.

1092
01:15:09,766 --> 01:15:12,531
What if something goes down and someone got killed!

1093
01:15:12,703 --> 01:15:16,195
I would have to live with that.
I'd be happier shitting my pants.

1094
01:15:16,373 --> 01:15:17,670
Much happier.

1095
01:15:21,745 --> 01:15:23,906
- Let's go.
- We're supposed to call the police.

1096
01:15:24,081 --> 01:15:25,173
No. No time.

1097
01:15:25,349 --> 01:15:27,249
No, no. No. It's good.

1098
01:15:30,354 --> 01:15:31,378
Drop the paint.

1099
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:35,884
Get out of here, Ahab, or I'll cut your eyes out.

1100
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:38,528
- Maybe we should let him finish.
- No, no, no.

1101
01:15:38,696 --> 01:15:41,461
What you cut my eyes out with!
The Neosporin!

1102
01:15:44,468 --> 01:15:46,197
My blade, camel jockey.

1103
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:49,772
My friend, the beating I give you
if you stop the spraying...

1104
01:15:49,941 --> 01:15:53,432
...is much less than the beating
I give you if you try to cut me.

1105
01:15:57,748 --> 01:15:59,045
What are you laughing at!

1106
01:15:59,917 --> 01:16:02,614
That was just with everyone.

1107
01:16:13,431 --> 01:16:15,092
They had it coming to them, right!

1108
01:16:15,267 --> 01:16:17,497
Yeah. Yeah, it seemed like it. Yeah.

1109
01:16:17,669 --> 01:16:21,469
- Okay, you take it from here.
- I got it.

1110
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,004
Everything's gonna be okay.

1111
01:16:26,444 --> 01:16:28,674
What you gotta say about that, huh!

1112
01:16:32,951 --> 01:16:35,351
You're telling me our guys can't handle...

1113
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,751
...some neighborhood night-watching losers!

1114
01:16:38,924 --> 01:16:41,791
We can't even put a scare into these people!

1115
01:16:41,961 --> 01:16:43,689
The main guy who got in the way...

1116
01:16:43,862 --> 01:16:47,025
...is the same one who's bringing
old biddies into Rafaela Salon.

1117
01:16:47,198 --> 01:16:48,393
My aunt goes there.

1118
01:16:48,566 --> 01:16:51,967
She says besides the sex,
the guy gives a pretty good haircut.

1119
01:16:52,137 --> 01:16:54,264
Don't talk to me about that dump.

1120
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:58,934
I've got a huge, classy hotel standing there...

1121
01:16:59,111 --> 01:17:01,635
...and it's staring at that cheap garbage.

1122
01:17:01,813 --> 01:17:04,145
I want it staring at the Supercuts.

1123
01:17:04,316 --> 01:17:10,118
Now, has anyone made any headway
with any of these foreign people!

1124
01:17:10,288 --> 01:17:13,349
I spoke to the manager of Going
Out Of Business again yesterday.

1125
01:17:13,526 --> 01:17:16,154
I stated our price and the urgency of the matter...

1126
01:17:16,329 --> 01:17:19,320
...and he offered me two-thirds less
and a Toshiba DVD player.

1127
01:17:19,497 --> 01:17:22,058
The people at Everything Must Go were just as difficult.

1128
01:17:22,234 --> 01:17:25,532
They offered me a Blu-ray disc and a jar of hummus.

1129
01:17:26,038 --> 01:17:27,130
What's hummus!

1130
01:17:27,306 --> 01:17:29,206
It's a very tasty...

1131
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:30,842
...diarrhea-like substance.

1132
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:33,308
Grant Walbridge has a vision.

1133
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:37,779
A vision for Lower Manhattan
to have the first indoor mall...

1134
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:41,181
...with its own 300-foot roller coaster.

1135
01:17:41,354 --> 01:17:44,687
You know, you're lucky I have
a world-class superhot girlfriend...

1136
01:17:44,857 --> 01:17:48,691
...with a perfectly proportioned ass-to-breast ratio...

1137
01:17:48,861 --> 01:17:50,726
...or I'd be furious.

1138
01:17:50,896 --> 01:17:52,887
She is smoking, sir.

1139
01:17:53,066 --> 01:17:54,930
I'd pay to spend an hour with her, sir.

1140
01:17:55,102 --> 01:17:56,363
Let me in on that.

1141
01:17:56,535 --> 01:17:58,093
Well, thank you.

1142
01:17:58,270 --> 01:18:04,334
But if you bitches can't get those people out...

1143
01:18:04,510 --> 01:18:07,240
...I will find other people who will get the job done.

1144
01:18:07,413 --> 01:18:10,178
However, whenever.

1145
01:18:11,417 --> 01:18:16,754
Walbridge!

1146
01:18:24,096 --> 01:18:25,461
This is where I find them.

1147
01:18:25,631 --> 01:18:28,897
But I don't know if it's same people
who try to Neosporin salon.

1148
01:18:29,069 --> 01:18:32,937
But you caught them writing this crap,
so, what do you do!

1149
01:18:35,108 --> 01:18:37,941
- You don't mess with the Zohan.
- Check it.

1150
01:18:38,111 --> 01:18:39,100
- Disco.
- Disco.

1151
01:18:39,279 --> 01:18:40,268
- Good.
- Good.

1152
01:18:40,447 --> 01:18:42,937
Why did you do this to Naseef's store, huh!

1153
01:18:43,115 --> 01:18:44,583
Why you blame the Israelis!

1154
01:18:44,751 --> 01:18:46,651
We come to work, go out of business.

1155
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:49,687
No, no, no.
Is not Israeli who do this.

1156
01:18:49,856 --> 01:18:52,620
I do community watch.
Don't worry, it's all taken care of.

1157
01:18:52,793 --> 01:18:56,160
Not Israeli! Who else would write "Arab go home"!

1158
01:18:56,329 --> 01:18:59,856
Oh, I don't know, just maybe 99 percent of the world.

1159
01:19:00,734 --> 01:19:02,725
- You see what he says!
- That was joke.

1160
01:19:02,903 --> 01:19:06,566
Come on, come on.
You guys get along here, stop this.

1161
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:10,836
Yeah, here it's okay. It's just there,
the war is never going to end.

1162
01:19:11,511 --> 01:19:14,879
You know, we were so close to peace
before the asshole shot Rabin.

1163
01:19:16,016 --> 01:19:17,381
Bush, he see the big picture.

1164
01:19:17,551 --> 01:19:19,985
Bush no want peace, he set it all back.

1165
01:19:20,153 --> 01:19:23,590
What about Bush's wife!
This is a wife I would get sticky with.

1166
01:19:23,757 --> 01:19:25,884
I would do this. I would do this.

1167
01:19:26,059 --> 01:19:28,755
- Yes, yes.
- What about Clinton! I would do Hillary.

1168
01:19:30,664 --> 01:19:31,859
The big legs.

1169
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:34,967
Yeah, she look strict,
like she's going to teach me a lesson.

1170
01:19:35,135 --> 01:19:37,296
- Yes, discipline.
- You know what's funny!

1171
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:39,234
I like Chelsea.

1172
01:19:39,406 --> 01:19:40,998
You're crazy.

1173
01:19:42,343 --> 01:19:43,901
She has beautiful legs.

1174
01:19:44,879 --> 01:19:48,872
If I want legs, I'll take Obama's wife.
She has legs.

1175
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:51,109
This is what happens when they talk politics.

1176
01:19:51,285 --> 01:19:53,185
No, no, no, wife of McCain!

1177
01:19:53,354 --> 01:19:56,585
She has the ass, and you know she's not getting any.

1178
01:19:57,792 --> 01:20:02,195
I understand my assistant explained the job to you.

1179
01:20:02,362 --> 01:20:05,025
He told us.
You wanna get some people out your building...

1180
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:08,134
...so you can build some kind of roller coaster mall.

1181
01:20:08,302 --> 01:20:11,533
Sir, I just wanna thank you for this opportunity.

1182
01:20:11,706 --> 01:20:15,870
I mean, it's a gift to mess with the Jews
and the terrorists on the same night.

1183
01:20:16,043 --> 01:20:17,375
I mean, it's like...

1184
01:20:17,545 --> 01:20:20,446
- It's like...
- Christmas in July.

1185
01:20:20,615 --> 01:20:22,480
It's like Christmas in July.

1186
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:25,619
<i>Right now we are scheduled to sabotage...</i>

1187
01:20:25,787 --> 01:20:28,653
<i>...a black peoples' parade in Chicago...</i>

1188
01:20:28,823 --> 01:20:31,053
...but we can move that.

1189
01:20:31,225 --> 01:20:34,661
Well, I'm not really quite sure how you move a parade.

1190
01:20:34,829 --> 01:20:37,320
That's easy, it's just a phone call.

1191
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:41,332
Well, we'll be calling back to make the arrangements.

1192
01:20:41,502 --> 01:20:45,405
Can I just say that I don't like most rich people,
but you get it.

1193
01:20:45,573 --> 01:20:48,064
<i>We built this country on the right to bear arms.</i>

1194
01:20:48,242 --> 01:20:52,144
Now they're trying to tell me how many
bullets my gun can shoot per second.

1195
01:20:52,313 --> 01:20:56,045
They're trying to tell me
whether I can stockpile weapons...

1196
01:20:56,217 --> 01:20:57,913
...in the shed behind my house.

1197
01:20:58,086 --> 01:21:00,679
- Right, by God.
- Anyway, you're a rich guy that gets it.

1198
01:21:00,855 --> 01:21:03,119
You and Mel Gibson.

1199
01:21:05,561 --> 01:21:09,088
Mel Gibson. Not too shabby.

1200
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:13,591
<i>Welcome to Hezbollah customer service.</i>

1201
01:21:13,768 --> 01:21:15,202
<i>All lines are busy now.</i>

1202
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:20,637
<i>Your call will be received in... minutes.</i>

1203
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:23,640
Come on with this.
How we find Phantom!

1204
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:27,111
<i>Well, he probably hang at the muchentuchen restaurant.</i>

1205
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:29,807
Okay, but which!
He have, like, 200.

1206
01:21:29,985 --> 01:21:31,179
Probably in Amman.

1207
01:21:31,353 --> 01:21:33,548
<i>In downtown he get the hottest poochibaba.</i>

1208
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:42,492
What's the area code of Amman!

1209
01:22:23,506 --> 01:22:24,904
Hello. Phantom Muchentuchen.

1210

Idiot.

1213
01:22:31,814 --> 01:22:34,282
Want speak to Phantom.

1214
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:37,351
No, no, no. Phantom not here.

1216
01:22:41,057 --> 01:22:42,649
<i>But what about for poonibaba!</i>

1217
01:22:42,825 --> 01:22:46,226
<i>No, no, poonibaba at store on 3rd and Lachalta.</i>

1218
01:22:46,396 --> 01:22:48,956
Oh, okay. So you have number for store!

1219
01:22:49,132 --> 01:22:50,759
You call information.

1220
01:22:50,933 --> 01:22:53,367
You don't have number for other store!

1221
01:22:55,805 --> 01:22:57,204
It's somewhere. I don't know.

1222
01:22:57,373 --> 01:23:03,312
Come on, get number! I calling from America, fry bitch!

1223
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:05,311
Salim, the kids.

1224
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:08,609
When she is grown up she will understand!

1225
01:23:10,219 --> 01:23:11,914
Hello.

1226
01:23:14,023 --> 01:23:17,289
I find the Zohan.
You not kill the Zohan.

1227
01:23:17,461 --> 01:23:19,052
I kill the Zohan.

1228
01:23:19,228 --> 01:23:22,096
No, you did not.
I find him in America.

1229
01:23:22,266 --> 01:23:24,859

1230
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:27,264
Okay. Bring this.

1231
01:23:27,437 --> 01:23:28,632
I am bringing.

1232
01:23:35,045 --> 01:23:36,068
<i>You see?</i>

1233
01:23:36,246 --> 01:23:39,773
But the hairstyle, it is hideous.

1234
01:23:39,949 --> 01:23:41,042
This is same Zohan.

1235
01:23:41,218 --> 01:23:44,209
<i>What he thinking! He look like guy from Who's the Boss?</i>

1236
01:23:44,387 --> 01:23:46,652
Look, this is same Zohan.

1237
01:23:46,824 --> 01:23:51,124
Everybody think you big hero.
But I tell everyone you not big hero.

1238
01:23:51,295 --> 01:23:53,263
Okay, okay, okay!
What you want, huh!

1239
01:23:53,430 --> 01:23:55,955
<i>I want muchentuchen restaurant chain.</i>

1240
01:23:56,133 --> 01:23:57,293
No.

1241
01:23:57,468 --> 01:24:00,164
But if I tell, you no have chain anyway.

1242
01:24:00,337 --> 01:24:02,601
So you not give any incentive.

1243
01:24:03,974 --> 01:24:06,909
<i>Okay. I want 50 percent of muchentuchen chain.</i>

1244
01:24:07,077 --> 01:24:10,478
<i>- Phantom & Salim Muchentuchen.
- No.</i>

1245
01:24:10,647 --> 01:24:12,274
- Twenty-five percent.
- No.

1246
01:24:12,449 --> 01:24:15,441
I want yogurt shop attached to store, like food court.

1247
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:16,943

- Some profits.
- No.

1250
01:24:20,858 --> 01:24:22,827
I get free yogurt when I come to store.

1251
01:24:23,527 --> 01:24:25,290
Okay. Within reason.

1252
01:24:25,462 --> 01:24:26,987
And I want some of your wives.

1253
01:24:27,431 --> 01:24:28,763
<i>How many wives you want?</i>

1254
01:24:28,933 --> 01:24:30,263
- Twenty.

1255
01:24:30,434 --> 01:24:32,265
- I sleep with one wife.

Okay.

1258

My friends, look what I do.
I hook you all up with tickets.

1259
01:24:56,895 --> 01:24:59,658
This Walbridge guy's trying to kiss salon's ass...

1260
01:24:59,831 --> 01:25:02,527
...so he give me 20 tickets hackyside.

1261
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:06,659
Very nice. Hassan, you see this!

1262
01:25:07,672 --> 01:25:10,869
This is where you're going to be
when Israel kick your ass.

1263
01:25:11,042 --> 01:25:14,341
Yes! No, you're gonna give it up
like you give up Gaza Strip, huh!

1264
01:25:16,381 --> 01:25:18,349
Excuse us.

1265
01:25:20,185 --> 01:25:21,277
I have to show you this.

1266
01:25:21,453 --> 01:25:25,049
Listen to Fatima Zaad's gossip column on Page Nine.

1267
01:25:25,224 --> 01:25:28,317
"A hall of fame terrorist is visiting New York...

1268
01:25:28,493 --> 01:25:30,825
...and not for the muchentuchen."

1269
01:25:31,530 --> 01:25:34,259
- Phantom's coming to the City!
- There's more.

1270
01:25:34,432 --> 01:25:38,596
"He's coming to hacky sack a certain scrappy Israeli...

1271
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:43,002
...who says he cuts hair, but really cuts terrorist."

1272
01:25:44,643 --> 01:25:45,905
He's ruined everything.

1273
01:25:46,078 --> 01:25:48,376
Why you say! You the Zohan.

1274
01:25:48,547 --> 01:25:51,038
He come to hacky sack, you take him out.

1275
01:25:51,216 --> 01:25:53,741
No, I don't care.
I come here to start new life.

1276
01:25:53,918 --> 01:25:56,820
Get new woman to love and make the bang-boom.

1277
01:25:56,989 --> 01:25:59,219
Now my life's followed me here.

1278
01:26:08,067 --> 01:26:10,900
Maybe Phantom no care anymore.

1279
01:27:05,926 --> 01:27:08,451
You're an Israeli counterterrorist!

1280
01:27:08,628 --> 01:27:10,027
- I knew it.
- What!

1281
01:27:10,196 --> 01:27:13,494
Well, the Israeli part.
Because he's circumcised.

1282
01:27:14,467 --> 01:27:17,333
How is Dalia going to forgive me!

1283
01:27:17,503 --> 01:27:18,903
I'm liar.

1284
01:27:19,072 --> 01:27:22,007
She Palestinian, I'm no Australian.

1285
01:27:22,175 --> 01:27:25,110
You know, Scrappy... I mean, "Zohard."

1286
01:27:25,278 --> 01:27:28,304
if there's one thing I've learned from all my relationships...

1287
01:27:28,481 --> 01:27:32,611
...with Jewish men, Puerto Rican men, aborigines...

1288
01:27:34,287 --> 01:27:37,256
...you can't have secrets in a relationship.

1289
01:27:37,424 --> 01:27:42,225
You tell her the truth
and if she really is this special one...

1290
01:27:42,395 --> 01:27:45,058
...everything will work out just fine.

1291
01:27:45,799 --> 01:27:47,892
I like this.

1292
01:27:52,904 --> 01:27:56,965
I am sorry I not tell you the truth before
I make you fall head over tits for me.

1293
01:27:57,141 --> 01:28:01,168
But believe me, I am wanting you even more.

1294
01:28:02,181 --> 01:28:04,910
I know you're not from where you say.

1295
01:28:05,082 --> 01:28:07,175
I see how you look at the Fizzy Bubblech.

1296
01:28:07,351 --> 01:28:11,378
Then why you like this!
Is it because I Israel and you Palestine!

1297
01:28:11,556 --> 01:28:13,081
Come on, tell me in my face.

1298
01:28:13,258 --> 01:28:16,694
Zohan, you're not just Israel.

1299
01:28:16,862 --> 01:28:18,762
You Israel.

1300
01:28:18,931 --> 01:28:20,899
But you say hate is stupid.

1301
01:28:21,066 --> 01:28:24,866
That's why you run to America, to get
away from the hate and the fighting.

1302
01:28:25,470 --> 01:28:28,563
I was even thinking we let all this cool down...

1303
01:28:28,739 --> 01:28:30,707
...I go out and get us a house over there.

1304
01:28:30,875 --> 01:28:33,470
We move in together, we cut the hair...

1305
01:28:33,645 --> 01:28:36,409
make the children, cut the children's hair.

1306
01:28:36,582 --> 01:28:38,948
Zohan, I can't.

1307
01:28:39,818 --> 01:28:43,413
I have open mind, but you Israeli counterterrorist.

1308
01:28:43,589 --> 01:28:45,284
No, no, no. I no do this anymore.

1309
01:28:45,457 --> 01:28:48,187
You put the fork in the fat lady, it's over.

1310
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:50,521
She's had enough to eat.
This is a promise.

1311
01:28:50,696 --> 01:28:53,187
It doesn't matter.

1312
01:28:53,365 --> 01:28:55,458
You don't know my family.

1313
01:28:55,634 --> 01:28:58,102
Or maybe you do.

1314
01:28:58,271 --> 01:28:59,532
What does this mean!

1315
01:29:00,772 --> 01:29:02,536
Just leave.

1316
01:29:02,709 --> 01:29:04,643
Please, it can't be.

1317
01:29:09,082 --> 01:29:11,414
Maybe is for best.

1318
01:29:12,251 --> 01:29:15,380
You deserve a safe life.

1319
01:29:16,722 --> 01:29:18,883
But know...

1320
01:29:19,826 --> 01:29:23,056
you will always be my special one.

1321
01:29:34,674 --> 01:29:36,767
- Zohan.
- Dalia.

1322
01:29:39,412 --> 01:29:40,845
I got you a gift.

1323
01:29:41,014 --> 01:29:43,141
A gift.

1324
01:29:46,919 --> 01:29:49,410
They come out with new book!

1325
01:29:49,589 --> 01:29:54,424
Yes. They do it every 21 years, I think.

1326
01:29:54,593 --> 01:29:56,788
Just a slight update from yours.

1327
01:30:02,502 --> 01:30:04,493
No feathering!

1328
01:30:04,671 --> 01:30:05,968
Or scrunching!

1329
01:30:06,706 --> 01:30:08,003
Where's the style!

1330
01:30:09,042 --> 01:30:13,776
But I know this is nice gesture.
Thank you.

1331
01:30:15,048 --> 01:30:16,675
Goodbye, Zohan.

1332
01:30:16,849 --> 01:30:19,079
Goodbye.

1333
01:30:25,525 --> 01:30:27,618
Goodbye.

1334
01:30:52,685 --> 01:30:54,347
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

1335
01:30:54,521 --> 01:30:56,011
Me too.

1336
01:30:56,190 --> 01:30:57,451
You still go to Hacky Sack!

1337
01:30:57,624 --> 01:31:00,593
Yes, it's better I find him than he finds me, huh!

1338
01:31:00,761 --> 01:31:03,821
I got your back.
I get you best army guys in city.

1339
01:31:03,997 --> 01:31:06,966
No, no, no. I handle this alone.

1340
01:31:16,944 --> 01:31:18,741
Hello! Let's go.

1341
01:31:37,064 --> 01:31:39,533
Go. Go, go, go.

1342
01:32:04,626 --> 01:32:09,063
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, here are your Israeli Blue Stars...</i>

1343
01:32:09,230 --> 01:32:13,394
<i>... and your Lebanese Trees!</i>

1344
01:32:25,079 --> 01:32:27,309
Fizzy Bubblech.

1345
01:32:39,894 --> 01:32:42,386
What's with the cheers!
Wasn't that guy a terrorist!

1346
01:32:42,564 --> 01:32:45,055
Yeah, people used to boo you too, John, you remember!

1347
01:32:45,233 --> 01:32:46,757
I wasn't a terrorist.

1348
01:32:46,935 --> 01:32:49,199
You were pretty bad.

1349
01:32:51,206 --> 01:32:55,166
I brought this great event
to New York to tell the world...

1350
01:32:55,344 --> 01:32:57,312
that New York City...

1351
01:32:57,480 --> 01:33:01,712
loves its foreign immigrant-types from the Middle East.

1352
01:33:02,851 --> 01:33:07,585
My hot girlfriend and I know that we can all get along...

1353
01:33:07,756 --> 01:33:13,216
...whether you're white, or brown, or khaki,
whatever that color is.

1354
01:33:13,394 --> 01:33:17,729
And here to sing the American national anthem...

1355
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:20,368
a superstar we all love:

1356
01:33:20,536 --> 01:33:22,766
Mariah Carey!

1357
01:33:49,132 --> 01:33:50,655
<i>Goal!</i>

1358
01:33:50,833 --> 01:33:53,097
<i>And disco break!</i>

1359
01:34:08,285 --> 01:34:11,617
Disco, disco, good, good!
Disco, disco, good, good!

1360
01:34:11,787 --> 01:34:15,655
Disco, disco, good, good!
Disco, disco, good, good!

1361
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:19,657
Okay, Mariah. Couple more.

1362
01:34:19,828 --> 01:34:22,627
This one's from Sheik Fayalah of Lebanon.

1363
01:34:22,799 --> 01:34:25,290
He wants you to write "All I want for Ramadan is you."

1364
01:34:25,468 --> 01:34:26,627
Okay, this again!

1365
01:34:26,803 --> 01:34:27,962
- I know.
- All right.

1366
01:34:28,137 --> 01:34:30,162
MC, there's a Mr. Phantom here to see you.

1367
01:34:30,339 --> 01:34:32,466
Who's Phantom, a dude trying to be a rapper!

1368
01:34:32,641 --> 01:34:35,702
- Because I don't know who that is.
- He says he's a killing machine.

1369
01:34:36,446 --> 01:34:38,141
Whatever. Okay.

1370
01:34:40,450 --> 01:34:42,714
Miss Mariah Carey.

1371
01:34:44,054 --> 01:34:47,023
It is a pleasure to meet you.

1372
01:34:47,190 --> 01:34:50,751
Thank you. Nice to meet you.
Hi, how are you!

1373
01:34:50,927 --> 01:34:54,385
Miss Carey, your high notes are so beautiful...

1374
01:34:54,564 --> 01:34:58,967
...like a Scud missile soaring towards its target.

1375
01:34:59,669 --> 01:35:01,967
- Thank you. That's really nice.
- Thank you.

1376
01:35:02,138 --> 01:35:03,833
So you know I'm not dead.

1377
01:35:05,475 --> 01:35:07,705
Oh, I sorry I startle.

1378
01:35:07,877 --> 01:35:11,745
I was not startle. I saw a bee.

1379
01:35:11,915 --> 01:35:14,383
There's a bee! I'm allergic.
It's not even funny.

1380
01:35:14,551 --> 01:35:17,043
No, no, no. Look.
The bee is gone. He's gone.

1381
01:35:17,221 --> 01:35:19,485
Mariah, believe me, there's no bee.

1382
01:35:19,656 --> 01:35:21,522
I'm allergic. You know I'm allergic.

1383
01:35:21,692 --> 01:35:26,492
No, no, no. The bee... Forget the bee.
The bee is made up, it's fiction.

1384
01:35:26,663 --> 01:35:28,995
It was a black wasp.

1385
01:35:29,165 --> 01:35:31,156
promising me that there was no bee here.

1386
01:35:31,334 --> 01:35:33,029
There was no bee. He says the bee...

1387
01:35:33,203 --> 01:35:36,435
...so he can look more like a person
who would not scream like this.

1388
01:35:36,607 --> 01:35:38,905
- Are you sure!
- I promise you.

1389
01:35:39,075 --> 01:35:40,407
I beg your cleavage's pardon.

1390
01:35:40,578 --> 01:35:45,015
We will be out of your bouncy hair in a jiffy.
Is between us.

1391
01:35:45,182 --> 01:35:47,843
I was going to kill you tomorrow...

1392
01:35:48,018 --> 01:35:54,423
...but I guess jackass can't wait to die for real.

1393
01:35:54,592 --> 01:35:56,252
Do y'all want us to leave!
Because we can go.

1394
01:35:56,426 --> 01:35:58,088
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

1395
01:35:58,262 --> 01:36:00,958
- We are not even here.
- Almost done. Give it a few seconds.

1396
01:36:03,034 --> 01:36:05,502
I came here to the States to stop the fighting...

1397
01:36:05,670 --> 01:36:07,695
...but I guess this will never end, eh!

1398
01:36:08,806 --> 01:36:12,572
Oh, Zohan does not want to fight anymore.

1399
01:36:12,743 --> 01:36:14,233
Scared of bees, huh!

1400
01:36:14,412 --> 01:36:17,610
Now I'm afraid of the bees!
I'm afraid of the bees!

1401
01:36:17,782 --> 01:36:19,910
What! You're the one that brings up the bees.

1402
01:36:21,152 --> 01:36:23,677
Your hair. Your hair does not do you justice.

1403
01:36:23,855 --> 01:36:26,153
You don't like this hair!
I think you're alone on this one.

1404
01:36:26,324 --> 01:36:27,790
Everyone else going crazy for it.

1405
01:36:27,958 --> 01:36:30,450
I like the 'fro better.

1406
01:36:30,629 --> 01:36:31,925
Hang on, I'm getting a call.

1407
01:36:34,031 --> 01:36:35,123
Michael, what is!

1408
01:36:35,299 --> 01:36:37,460
<i>Zohan? We have a problem here.</i>

1409
01:36:37,635 --> 01:36:40,297
- Where you get that!
- This is a Sony Ericsson.

1410
01:36:40,471 --> 01:36:42,906
- It has Bluetooth!
- Of course it has Bluetooth.

1411
01:36:43,075 --> 01:36:45,407
I can never figure that Bluetooth shit out, though.

1412
01:36:45,577 --> 01:36:48,170
Oh, no, it's very simple.
You sync it to your PowerBook.

1413
01:36:48,345 --> 01:36:50,973
- Tell her. Phantom will tell you.
- Mac or PC!

1414
01:36:51,650 --> 01:36:53,811
- Mac.
- You have MySpace!

1415
01:36:53,985 --> 01:36:56,215
The record company does.
It's not really mine.

1416
01:36:56,388 --> 01:36:59,357
Please, add me as a friend.

1417
01:37:00,158 --> 01:37:01,181
Sure, yeah, yeah.

1418
01:37:01,358 --> 01:37:04,351
Sure, as Huge Boner.
We'll add you tomorrow.

1419
01:37:04,563 --> 01:37:05,655
Michael, what is!

1420
01:37:05,831 --> 01:37:11,997
There's a bunch of guys and they are
lighting fires and it's getting pretty bad.

1421
01:37:14,406 --> 01:37:16,397
No. Stay where you are.

1422
01:37:16,575 --> 01:37:18,064
<i>Yeah, we'll stay up here.</i>

1423
01:37:18,610 --> 01:37:20,874
- What! Where you go!
- I have bigger fish to swim.

1424
01:37:21,046 --> 01:37:23,810
- Mariah, I love the newest album.
- Thank you.

1425
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:50,165
The Zohan.

1426
01:37:53,612 --> 01:37:54,840
My pita shop.

1427
01:37:56,783 --> 01:37:58,011
They burned it down.

1428
01:38:11,397 --> 01:38:12,728
Why you do this!

1429
01:38:12,899 --> 01:38:15,527
We no do this.
We at Hacky Sack as much as the next guy.

1430
01:38:15,701 --> 01:38:19,467
And I wish that we should do this,
after you write that shit on my wall.

1431
01:38:21,474 --> 01:38:23,032
Across street!

1432
01:38:23,209 --> 01:38:25,734
- Waleed, Waleed. Look, Waleed!
- No. My store.

1433
01:38:25,912 --> 01:38:30,076
You people ruined my store.
You people ruined my store.

1434
01:38:35,288 --> 01:38:37,483
What I miss!
I was stuck on West Broadway.

1435
01:38:37,657 --> 01:38:40,285
The Israeli burned down my store!

1436
01:38:40,459 --> 01:38:41,756
No, no, no.

1437
01:38:41,929 --> 01:38:43,691
I save store.

1438
01:38:43,863 --> 01:38:46,457
Then I kill the Zohan.

1439
01:38:48,901 --> 01:38:51,426
Phantom, kick its ass.

1440
01:38:51,604 --> 01:38:52,935
Jab it to the right.

1441
01:38:53,105 --> 01:38:54,970
Stick and move, Phantom.
Stick and move.

1442
01:38:55,675 --> 01:38:58,166
He can't do this alone.

1443
01:39:01,614 --> 01:39:03,014
Don't back down. Kick its ass.

1444
01:39:26,406 --> 01:39:28,374
Phantom.

1445
01:39:32,145 --> 01:39:33,510
Why you help me!

1446
01:39:34,046 --> 01:39:37,244
Because I'm through with this.

1447
01:39:37,417 --> 01:39:38,714
I no more fight.

1448
01:39:40,219 --> 01:39:43,553
You do whatever you want, but I no fight back.

1449
01:39:44,391 --> 01:39:46,552
It's trick, huh!

1450
01:39:46,727 --> 01:39:47,853
No.

1451
01:39:50,597 --> 01:39:53,066
- Fight back.
- No.

1452
01:39:53,233 --> 01:39:56,225
- Fight back!
- No.

1453
01:39:57,838 --> 01:39:58,964
Fight back, Zohan.

1454
01:39:59,139 --> 01:40:01,370
Fight him back. What are you doing!
Fight back.

1455
01:40:03,511 --> 01:40:04,568
No.

1456
01:40:04,745 --> 01:40:08,011
This is not fun for anybody.

1457
01:40:08,181 --> 01:40:09,546
Why you not fight back!

1458
01:40:09,717 --> 01:40:13,379
Because he know better.
He show you he change.

1459
01:40:13,787 --> 01:40:14,811
Sister!

1460
01:40:14,988 --> 01:40:16,979
When you gonna grow up, Fatoush!

1461
01:40:17,157 --> 01:40:18,352
Fatoush!

1462
01:40:18,526 --> 01:40:21,187
No, no, no Fatoush.

1463
01:40:21,361 --> 01:40:24,889
Is Phantom now.
And is my business.

1464
01:40:25,066 --> 01:40:27,693
Is my man, Fatoush.

1465
01:40:27,868 --> 01:40:29,336
You're my woman!

1466
01:40:29,504 --> 01:40:31,028
You Phantom's sister!

1467
01:40:31,205 --> 01:40:33,105
You tapping the Zohan!

1468
01:40:33,641 --> 01:40:35,472
You settle for a pee-pee touch!

1469
01:40:35,643 --> 01:40:38,873
I wouldn't say "settle."
It was negotiation.

1470
01:40:39,047 --> 01:40:40,275
Fatoush is talking.

1471
01:40:41,783 --> 01:40:44,945
Yes. I am Phantom's sister.

1472
01:40:46,387 --> 01:40:50,221
And, no, Fatoush, I am not tapping the Zohan.

1473
01:40:50,391 --> 01:40:54,293
But I think I love him.

1474
01:40:56,764 --> 01:40:58,095
This is good.

1475
01:40:58,266 --> 01:41:00,928
Of course you love me.
I'm very good man.

1476
01:41:04,672 --> 01:41:08,073
Brother, here in America we're the same.

1477
01:41:08,242 --> 01:41:12,110
We just people trying to get jobs
cutting hair, driving cabs...

1478
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:14,271
...selling crappy stereo equipment.

1479
01:41:14,449 --> 01:41:16,542
- Hey. Is Sony guts.
- Whatever.

1480
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:21,746
The point is, we are thousands
of miles away from all this hate...

1481
01:41:21,923 --> 01:41:24,585
...and we live together just fine.

1482
01:41:24,759 --> 01:41:26,317
We do.

1483
01:41:27,929 --> 01:41:29,089
We do.

1484
01:41:29,264 --> 01:41:34,167
Come on, people.
Where is the hate! Anyone!

1485
01:41:34,669 --> 01:41:36,500
- I resent.
- Resent is good.

1486
01:41:36,671 --> 01:41:37,969
What! What do you resent!

1487
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:39,231
People don't like us.

1488
01:41:39,407 --> 01:41:42,502
Come on, is not easy for us.
People don't like us too.

1489
01:41:42,678 --> 01:41:46,307
- Why!
- Because they think we are you.

1490
01:41:47,782 --> 01:41:50,149
We do look alike.
You got to admit this. Come on.

1491
01:41:51,086 --> 01:41:53,679
Waleed looks Mexican, to be honest.

1492
01:41:54,890 --> 01:41:56,117
Yeah, he do.

1493
01:41:57,793 --> 01:41:59,852
You know, ever since the stupid terrorists...

1494
01:42:00,029 --> 01:42:01,792
...everyone think we are terrorists.

1495
01:42:01,964 --> 01:42:03,864
Look, Bashir, no offense...

1496
01:42:04,033 --> 01:42:07,264
...but if you sat next to me on a plane,
I might want to get off too.

1497
01:42:10,205 --> 01:42:11,433
He's right.

1498
01:42:11,607 --> 01:42:16,044
But how could I not hate when you stole my goat!

1499
01:42:16,879 --> 01:42:19,370
I am sorry about your goat.

1500
01:42:19,548 --> 01:42:23,382
He was a good goat.
I treat him like member of the family.

1501
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:27,388
- Really!
- Yes.

1502
01:42:27,556 --> 01:42:30,616
Did you rub his chin!

1503
01:42:30,793 --> 01:42:32,761
Like this!

1504
01:42:32,928 --> 01:42:36,887
Yes, sometimes for hours.
He would make face if I stop.

1505
01:42:37,066 --> 01:42:38,557
He make the face!

1506
01:42:38,735 --> 01:42:41,601
Oh, the face. The face.

1507
01:42:41,770 --> 01:42:44,295
That's it, that's it.
That looks just like him.

1508
01:42:44,473 --> 01:42:48,136
As long as he was happy.

1509
01:42:48,310 --> 01:42:49,902
Is good. Very happy.

1510
01:42:52,815 --> 01:42:54,680
Holy shichumetz.

1511
01:42:54,850 --> 01:42:56,477
I see what is.

1512
01:42:59,888 --> 01:43:01,583
Those are cool. Who make this!

1513
01:43:28,951 --> 01:43:32,079
You see this! Bastard landlord.

1514
01:43:32,254 --> 01:43:33,653
He tell us go to Hacky Sack...

1515
01:43:33,822 --> 01:43:36,484
so he can make it look like we burn each other's store.

1516
01:43:36,658 --> 01:43:38,853
To make us look like we enemies.

1517
01:43:39,028 --> 01:43:40,551
This the real enemy.

1518
01:43:41,663 --> 01:43:44,029
I thought the whole place was going down.

1519
01:43:44,199 --> 01:43:45,531
Oh, we're waiting on them, sir.

1520
01:43:45,701 --> 01:43:51,698
We're drawing them closer,
like a fat queer to a dick sandwich.

1521
01:43:53,375 --> 01:43:55,070
Aharon, get weapons from truck.

1522
01:43:55,244 --> 01:43:57,371
No, no, no.
I wanna minimize collateral damage.

1523
01:43:57,546 --> 01:43:59,411
- I do this alone.
- I do this alone.

1524
01:43:59,581 --> 01:44:01,481
- We do this together.
- I go myself.

1525
01:44:01,650 --> 01:44:05,643
No, no, no. Listen.
Come on, already, big guy.

1526
01:44:05,821 --> 01:44:07,982
Let it go.
We're on the same side, here.

1527
01:44:08,157 --> 01:44:10,022
Don't "big guy" me, big guy.

1528
01:44:10,192 --> 01:44:12,559
Look, you think I didn't want to run like you did!

1529
01:44:12,729 --> 01:44:14,856
- Is no pressure here.
- What!

1530
01:44:15,031 --> 01:44:20,127
Listen, all I ever wanted since high
school was to go to States and...

1531
01:44:20,302 --> 01:44:23,568
- What!
- This hard to say.

1532
01:44:23,740 --> 01:44:25,833
Tell me, what is!

1533
01:44:27,310 --> 01:44:29,141
And sell shoes.

1534
01:44:29,312 --> 01:44:31,006
I love shoes.

1535
01:44:31,180 --> 01:44:34,947
No. That's great. I love to cut hair.

1536
01:44:35,118 --> 01:44:36,779
There is nothing wrong with that.

1537
01:44:36,953 --> 01:44:38,284
- Tell my parents.
- I hear you.

1538
01:44:38,455 --> 01:44:41,356
- They don't understand.
- Parents, they never do, huh!

1539
01:44:41,524 --> 01:44:44,891
- Never do. They think they're clever...
- You guys going, or what!

1540
01:44:45,428 --> 01:44:47,259
- Yes. Okay, we go.
- Yes. We go.

1541
01:44:47,430 --> 01:44:48,761
Come on, let's go.

1542
01:44:48,932 --> 01:44:50,627
Soup's on, boys.

1543
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,631
Hell, yeah!

1544
01:44:57,540 --> 01:44:58,939
What kind of shoes you like!

1545
01:44:59,108 --> 01:45:01,804
You know, Rockport, Ferragamo, the classics.

1546
01:45:07,284 --> 01:45:10,309
You should maybe try Hugo Boss, huh!

1547
01:45:10,487 --> 01:45:12,614
No, no, no.
They always cover the toes.

1548
01:45:12,789 --> 01:45:14,814
You stylist, you buy some style shoes.

1549
01:45:14,991 --> 01:45:18,155
Oh, yes, but I'm looking for function too.

1550
01:45:18,328 --> 01:45:21,320
Try mine. It's Kenneth Cole.

1551
01:45:21,499 --> 01:45:23,432
Square toe.

1552
01:45:24,734 --> 01:45:25,861
It is nice.

1553
01:45:26,036 --> 01:45:28,266
This is a fashion but you can wear to work also.

1554
01:45:29,472 --> 01:45:31,633
Yes. Hey, to be honest, it's a little tight.

1555
01:45:31,808 --> 01:45:34,937
- Let me measure.
- If you could.

1556
01:45:35,112 --> 01:45:37,137
I'm ready for you.

1557
01:45:37,314 --> 01:45:39,509
Okay, checking the width.

1558
01:45:39,683 --> 01:45:41,617
Triple E.

1559
01:45:41,785 --> 01:45:43,218
This is a big foot, huh!

1560
01:45:43,387 --> 01:45:44,513
You win again.

1561
01:45:44,688 --> 01:45:46,815
Is not a competition.

1562
01:45:46,991 --> 01:45:48,982
I do need to cut my nails.

1563
01:45:49,159 --> 01:45:51,059
We don't know what set off this fight.

1564
01:45:51,228 --> 01:45:53,924
It's apparently between Middle-Eastern merchants.

1565
01:45:54,098 --> 01:45:57,556
- Let's get some insight.
- They is no Middle East. Is all fake.

1566
01:45:57,735 --> 01:46:00,533
Is the landlord, the Walbridge guy.
He pay...

1567
01:46:00,704 --> 01:46:03,195
Excuse me.
Grant Walbridge, the developer?

1568
01:46:03,375 --> 01:46:04,466
Damn it!

1569
01:46:04,642 --> 01:46:07,805
Mariah Carey, I love you. I love you.

1570
01:46:07,978 --> 01:46:11,311
I find you, Mariah.
I come to where you are.

1571
01:46:11,482 --> 01:46:14,883
I love you too, horny little man.
Buy my new album.

1572
01:46:19,823 --> 01:46:21,950
Zohan. He has a bomb.

1573
01:46:23,794 --> 01:46:26,126
- And puppies.
- No.

1574
01:46:26,298 --> 01:46:27,787
I'm gonna blow up this block.

1575
01:46:27,965 --> 01:46:31,231
I'm gonna blow you up, I'm gonna blow up these puppies...

1576
01:46:31,403 --> 01:46:34,804
...and we all going to hell together,
because I hate these puppies.

1577
01:46:34,973 --> 01:46:38,032
We have no time. We have to make the sonic power, quick.

1578
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:41,178
- You mean the sound!
- Yes.

1579
01:46:41,346 --> 01:46:45,646
But Arab and Jews have not made
sound for thousands of years.

1580
01:46:45,817 --> 01:46:48,683
- Now is time, my friend.
- Thirty seconds.

1581
01:46:48,852 --> 01:46:53,186
You can't do nothing about it, Rabbi Towelhead.

1582
01:46:58,163 --> 01:47:00,631
No, no, no. Let me take the melody, you go harmony.

1583
01:47:00,799 --> 01:47:02,664
- Yes. Okay, okay.
- Here we go.

1584
01:47:29,095 --> 01:47:32,063
Well, hello, stranger.

1585
01:47:32,230 --> 01:47:34,289
Care for some chips!

1586
01:47:36,401 --> 01:47:37,801
Puppies!

1587
01:47:37,970 --> 01:47:41,063
That dog is incredibly cute.
Did you bring that dog!

1588
01:47:41,239 --> 01:47:42,934
Barry Manilow used to have a beagle...

1589
01:47:48,047 --> 01:47:52,484
Listen, I'm Grant Walbridge.
This is all a mistake and...

1590
01:47:58,391 --> 01:48:00,255
Keep it together. Keep it together.

1591
01:48:04,797 --> 01:48:06,822
No!

1592
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:10,327
My life is ruined.

1593
01:48:10,502 --> 01:48:11,993
They were perfect.

1594
01:48:12,171 --> 01:48:13,798
The ratio.

1595
01:48:13,973 --> 01:48:15,235
Why!

1596
01:48:17,943 --> 01:48:19,604
No, no, no. Stop.

1597
01:48:22,982 --> 01:48:26,418
What the heck are you doing!
Why you do this!

1598
01:48:26,585 --> 01:48:29,952
Sorry. Sorry. I got excited.

1599
01:48:30,122 --> 01:48:33,216
Okay, we fix.
We make mall, but this...

1600
01:48:33,392 --> 01:48:36,850
It's fine. Yes, it's fine.
We'll be fine.

1601
01:48:37,029 --> 01:48:39,156
It's all b'seder.

1602
01:48:50,644 --> 01:48:53,874
Goat rides! Everybody, goat ride.

1603
01:48:54,046 --> 01:48:56,537
The most wonderful goat in the world.

1604
01:49:00,686 --> 01:49:03,656
You come. Come, come. Come on.
Come on, now. Give ride.

1605
01:49:10,063 --> 01:49:12,395
I'm almost done.

1606
01:49:12,566 --> 01:49:15,057
- I love it.
- Yes, of course you do.

1607
01:49:15,234 --> 01:49:17,135
I had fun shampooing your hair...

1608
01:49:17,303 --> 01:49:20,501
...but I'd rather be licking it off those melons.

1609
01:49:20,874 --> 01:49:22,398
I knew he had it in him.

1610
01:49:22,576 --> 01:49:25,704
Yeah, he sounds like his mother.

1611
01:49:25,878 --> 01:49:28,746
Maybe I'll bleach your nipples and slap you in your face.

1612
01:49:28,915 --> 01:49:32,078
- Oh, now he's gone too far.
- That was disturbing. Too much.

1613
01:49:32,252 --> 01:49:34,948
Zohan!
Can you help this woman, please.

1614
01:49:35,122 --> 01:49:37,784
Of course, motek.
You know, if I was not married to you...

1615
01:49:37,958 --> 01:49:41,394
this is the kind of bootachem
I would go all night long w...

1616
01:49:41,561 --> 01:49:43,188
Hello, Zohan.

1617
01:49:45,232 --> 01:49:48,224
So this is where you work!

1618
01:49:50,303 --> 01:49:52,271
Yes, Abba.

1619
01:49:52,439 --> 01:49:56,102
And this is your Palestinian wife!

1620
01:49:58,112 --> 01:49:59,601
Yes, Abba.

1621
01:50:01,448 --> 01:50:03,211
Does she know you're a fagala?

1622
01:50:05,385 --> 01:50:06,784
I see. This is because...

1623
01:50:06,953 --> 01:50:08,751
Congratulations.

1624
01:50:08,922 --> 01:50:10,618
Now, cut my hair.

1625
01:50:10,792 --> 01:50:13,056
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1626
01:50:13,226 --> 01:50:15,306
I love it.
Please.
