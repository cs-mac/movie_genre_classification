Extra! Read all about it!

2
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,841
Extra! Read all about it! Extra!

3

Read all about it! Extra!
Read all about it!

4
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:40,514
The death of Wally Brandford,

5
00:00:40,722 --> 00:00:43,600
famous comedian, killed
in an Alaskan plane crash,

6
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:45,811
has left Hollywood in a state of shock.

7
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:47,729
This reporter talked
with Wally Brandford's

8
00:00:47,938 --> 00:00:50,732
long-time friend and producer,
Mr Caryl Fergusson,

9
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:53,485
in his office suite atop
the Beverly Hilton Hotel.

10
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:58,031
<i>Mr Fergusson informed this reporter
that in the absence of living relatives,</i>

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,159
<i>funeral arrangements
are being made by his staff.</i>

12
00:01:02,494 --> 00:01:04,830
Where's that boy with the ice?
What's with the service?

13
00:01:05,038 --> 00:01:08,166
Well, I guess I'll just have to struggle
along without any.

14
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:12,295
Fergy, are you saying that Wally
didn't leave us anything?

15
00:01:12,504 --> 00:01:14,005
Right.

16
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:18,009
I gave a lot of years
to end up with nothing.

17
00:01:18,218 --> 00:01:20,846
Oh, I suppose you call
that little house in Malibu

18
00:01:21,054 --> 00:01:23,723
that Wally gave you "nothing".

19
00:01:24,057 --> 00:01:25,433
You know what I mean.

20
00:01:25,642 --> 00:01:27,561
Well, I don't know what you mean.

21
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:30,230
Wally did give you
that house in Malibu.

22
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:32,190
He gave Ellen a trip
to Europe every year,

23
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:35,193
he gave me that property
in Palm Springs.

24
00:01:35,402 --> 00:01:40,365
Why, everybody in this room
was well taken care of...

25
00:01:41,408 --> 00:01:43,368
...before he ever got on that plane.

26
00:01:44,077 --> 00:01:45,537
OK, OK.

27
00:01:45,745 --> 00:01:47,080
So, what do we do now?

28
00:01:47,288 --> 00:01:50,166
We do what we've always done,
except we do it for somebody else.

29
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,127
What else can we do?

30
00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:55,547
I'll probably wind up as
a public relations man for some

31
00:01:55,755 --> 00:01:58,216
up-and-coming rock 'n' roll singer.

32
00:01:58,424 --> 00:02:02,637
And I'll write jokes
for a hillbilly television show.

33
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:06,599
And I'll produce for somebody,

34
00:02:06,808 --> 00:02:11,104
and Ellen will write letters
for some other somebody.

35
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,649
All seems like such a terrible waste.

36
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:17,568
I don't know.

37
00:02:17,944 --> 00:02:20,988
I've been watching
this little scene here,

38
00:02:21,197 --> 00:02:22,657
and I can't help myself.

39
00:02:22,865 --> 00:02:26,244
To me, it has all the makings
of a real melodrama.

40
00:02:26,452 --> 00:02:30,957
A great man passes on,
leaves behind him his expert staff.

41
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:33,251
What's going to happen?

42
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:35,002
Are they going to split up?

43
00:02:35,211 --> 00:02:37,463
Each one goes his own little ways,

44
00:02:37,672 --> 00:02:41,676
looks for a new subject
for his respective talent,

45
00:02:41,884 --> 00:02:46,263
or are they going to stick together
and work and fight as a unit?

46
00:02:47,765 --> 00:02:49,934
Tune in next week.

47
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:52,812
You know, you sound like a man
with very good questions

48
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,731
but never any answers.

49
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:59,777
Morgan, it's next week. I'm tuned in.

50
00:02:59,985 --> 00:03:03,280
- On with the show.
- Give me a light.

51
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:07,701
Maybe I can help you
with another question.

52
00:03:08,911 --> 00:03:10,955
Suppose when you first met Wally,

53
00:03:11,163 --> 00:03:14,166
you would have died in a plane crash.
Then what would have happened?

54
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,919
I suppose he would have gotten
another writer

55
00:03:17,127 --> 00:03:18,462
and taught him all his tricks.

56
00:03:20,506 --> 00:03:22,216
Very good.

57
00:03:22,424 --> 00:03:24,093
What about Ellen?

58
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:26,136
Well, the same thing, I guess.

59
00:03:26,345 --> 00:03:28,847
You get a gold star.

60
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:31,183
It's true.

61
00:03:31,392 --> 00:03:33,268
Wally taught me his style
of handling people

62
00:03:33,477 --> 00:03:36,021
until I could do it
as well as he could.

63
00:03:36,271 --> 00:03:38,649
I guess he could have taught anyone
the same thing.

64
00:03:38,857 --> 00:03:41,735
You see?
I don't have to go any further.

65
00:03:41,944 --> 00:03:45,572
This is the position we are in,
each one of us, including me,

66
00:03:45,781 --> 00:03:48,075
except that Wally's gone
and we are here.

67
00:03:48,283 --> 00:03:50,327
What's the answer?

68
00:03:53,372 --> 00:03:54,915
You mean get somebody in his place?

69
00:03:55,123 --> 00:03:57,084
That's right.

70
00:03:57,376 --> 00:04:00,003
You mean get some nobody
and then...

71
00:04:00,212 --> 00:04:01,713
- Correct.
- Teach him everything we know?

72
00:04:01,922 --> 00:04:03,799
- Correct.
- No.

73
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:05,425
Not what we know.

74
00:04:05,634 --> 00:04:07,678
Teach him everything we've learned.

75
00:04:07,886 --> 00:04:13,892
After all, wasn't it Wally who taught
Chic, Ellen, Harry, myself,

76
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:16,019
most of what we know
about this business?

77
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:18,647
Yes. And even you, Morgan.

78
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:20,899
Although you directed successfully
on Broadway,

79
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:23,777
Wally taught you
the motion-picture business.

80
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,198
Of course!

81
00:04:28,698 --> 00:04:33,370
Teach somebody.
Why, it's the only thing we can do.

82
00:04:34,663 --> 00:04:36,081
But who?

83
00:04:36,915 --> 00:04:38,833
Wait a minute, Caryl.

84
00:04:39,876 --> 00:04:42,837
Let's have an understanding as to...

85
00:04:43,254 --> 00:04:45,507
...why we're going to do this.

86
00:04:45,715 --> 00:04:48,176
If it's at all feasible.

87
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:53,765
Are we going to do this
because we're spoiled...

88
00:04:54,099 --> 00:05:00,021
...and used to a comfortable,
well-oiled machine?

89
00:05:01,314 --> 00:05:03,816
Or is it simply because...

90
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:08,947
...we've been happy
working as a family...

91
00:05:09,781 --> 00:05:12,033
...and we hate the thought
of breaking up?

92
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:18,081
Ellen, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

93
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:21,709
But the big question still remains:

94
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:23,628
Who?

95
00:05:28,424 --> 00:05:30,051
Who?

96
00:05:30,718 --> 00:05:32,053
The bellboy.

97
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:33,596
I'm...

98
00:05:35,723 --> 00:05:39,435
The... Well, you said, "Who?"
I mean...

99
00:05:39,644 --> 00:05:43,940
See, when I... I had a...
All my clothes were wet,

100
00:05:44,148 --> 00:05:48,819
so I changed my clothes because
when I... That's why I was long.

101
00:05:50,863 --> 00:05:53,366
Should I... Or not?

102
00:05:53,616 --> 00:05:55,284
Just stand?

103
00:05:55,576 --> 00:05:57,787
I'll close the door.

104
00:06:00,456 --> 00:06:01,957
I'll...

105
00:06:04,877 --> 00:06:06,629
I'll...

106
00:06:06,837 --> 00:06:10,090
The key-ring was caught in the door,

107
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:13,177
but I'll get...
I can rinse all of these out.

108
00:06:13,385 --> 00:06:19,266
But this is not... They...
Very hard to hold because they...

109
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:24,939
This is a dirty...
See, they're hard to...

110
00:06:25,147 --> 00:06:29,818
Oh, good shot. Do you like...?
Would you like soda or ginger?

111
00:06:32,071 --> 00:06:33,447
This is a...

112
00:06:33,656 --> 00:06:35,908
Looks like a diamond, if I was...

113
00:06:36,408 --> 00:06:38,035
Get the dust off.

114
00:06:38,869 --> 00:06:40,496
If...

115
00:06:41,955 --> 00:06:44,333
Would you like me to...

116
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,918
...put...?

117
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,881
Shall I...?

118
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,092
Why don't I... I can...

119
00:07:00,182 --> 00:07:05,103
What did I do? I was only late
because... You see...

120
00:07:05,854 --> 00:07:08,023
...they called, and when I fell in the...
I had to...

121
00:07:08,231 --> 00:07:10,108
...change.

122
00:07:10,317 --> 00:07:13,945
But was it the door?
Because when I...

123
00:07:14,154 --> 00:07:17,574
The door is only my ring.

124
00:07:17,783 --> 00:07:20,243
I bent my ring.

125
00:07:20,452 --> 00:07:24,372
But the... Should I...
Would you like in the bar?

126
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:27,501
Or, here, this man could have it. None.

127
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:31,922
So far. It's not...
It's new ice and it's fresh.

128
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,465
What did I do?

129
00:07:33,673 --> 00:07:36,051
I mean, because it was long?
Is that why you...?

130
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:38,720
Don't hurt or nothing. I just...

131
00:07:38,929 --> 00:07:41,473
We could re-chill it.

132
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:46,019
What do you...? You seem
very strangely mad about my ice.

133
00:07:46,227 --> 00:07:48,772
I mean, I'll get you clean,
if you don't want a dirty pot,

134
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,315
but it's a clean...

135
00:07:50,523 --> 00:07:53,902
Hey, wait...
Hey, this is new... This is new ice!

136
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:46,430
Oh, right from
the diving board, and I...

137
00:09:46,638 --> 00:09:50,350
Up, because I had my rabbit's foot.
And I never thought it was lucky,

138
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,855
because I figured if this was so lucky,
how come the rabbit lost it?

139
00:09:55,063 --> 00:09:56,523
What...?

140
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:58,525
What is your name, son?

141
00:09:58,734 --> 00:10:00,569
Stanley. My friends call me that too.

142
00:10:00,777 --> 00:10:02,237
Well, I'm Caryl Fergusson.

143
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:04,364
- I'm very...
- This is Morgan Heywood.

144
00:10:04,573 --> 00:10:06,158
- I certainly...
- That's Bruce Arden.

145
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:08,702
- It's my...
- This is Chic Wymore,

146
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:10,537
- and that's Harry Silver.
- I'm very...

147
00:10:10,746 --> 00:10:12,873
- Now, Stanley, just come with me.
- I didn't shake...

148
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:14,875
But I didn't... I met...

149
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,294
Wait a second.
Is this on account of the ice?

150
00:10:17,502 --> 00:10:18,837
It's just cubes.

151
00:10:19,046 --> 00:10:23,300
I'll get... You can get fresh cu...
Because they weren't damp?

152
00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:26,386
Wait a minute. Why am I getting...?
There's no hitting or...

153
00:10:26,595 --> 00:10:31,224
Hey. What is it?
Did I do a bad thing?

154
00:10:32,642 --> 00:10:34,394
Now, let me ask you a few questions.

155
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:36,771
- Oh, oh, all right. Yeah.
- Tell me, do you work here?

156
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,357
- Do you like music?
- Have you got a favourite flower?

157
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:43,737
- What's your favourite dance?
- Do you enjoy what you're doing?

158
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:46,615
- Well, no, but I...
- How about...?

159
00:10:46,823 --> 00:10:52,078
Wait, fellas, please! Relax, will
you, please, and let me do the talking.

160
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,832
Yeah, let him relax
so I can talk... then.

161
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,834
Stanley.

162
00:10:58,043 --> 00:10:59,419
How much do you make a week?

163
00:10:59,627 --> 00:11:02,422
Here, now? Work...

164
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:05,300
Well, I get... I have the concession...

165
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:07,886
In the papers, I have the third,
fourth and fifth floor,

166
00:11:08,094 --> 00:11:10,180
but six and seven is Artie
and Philip and Maurie.

167
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:11,723
Then I have dogs, I walk dogs.

168
00:11:11,931 --> 00:11:13,933
And I have a special
after-late-hour snack I deliver,

169
00:11:14,142 --> 00:11:16,269
which is also in the pool
with the other bellboys.

170
00:11:16,477 --> 00:11:17,896
We split up at the end of the week.

171
00:11:18,104 --> 00:11:20,690
Then there's cars out to the track.
We used to have the Hertz cars,

172
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:22,525
but now, since they put them
in the driver's seat,

173
00:11:22,734 --> 00:11:24,611
we don't get the action.
That really hurts.

174
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:27,780
Then, of course, we pick up extra
dollars and we... Well, there's also tips.

175
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:30,575
Yeah. Now, we know
that you're very busy, Stanley.

176
00:11:30,783 --> 00:11:34,537
But I mean, in round figures,
how much is that a week?

177
00:11:34,746 --> 00:11:37,540
You mean everything all total?
It's 11 and a half dollars a week.

178
00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:40,209
And that's with golden hours,
time-and-a-half and I worked Saturday

179
00:11:40,418 --> 00:11:42,837
and nine days altogether last week.

180
00:11:43,463 --> 00:11:45,631
- Stanley, my boy.
- Yeah?

181
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:51,512
How would you like to make
150 dollars each and every week?

182
00:12:00,313 --> 00:12:02,815
- Caryl, Caryl.
- Quiet, Harry, quiet.

183
00:12:03,024 --> 00:12:05,568
I think he's trying to
tell us something.

184
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:20,541
All right. All right, 175, but that's it.

185
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:46,316
Calm down. Relax.

186
00:12:46,525 --> 00:12:48,068
Come on, relax.

187
00:12:48,277 --> 00:12:49,695
All that money!

188
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:51,613
Quiet.

189
00:12:51,822 --> 00:12:53,282
Now, listen.

190
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,661
Besides the 175 bucks each week,
there'll be lots of extras.

191
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,540
- Yeah?
- All the beautiful dames you'll be with.

192
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,709
Sharp cars.

193
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,628
Night spots. We pay all expenses.

194
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:10,173
Wine, women and song
all the way, kid.

195
00:13:10,382 --> 00:13:13,135
- Yeah!
- How does it sound?

196
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:18,890
Yes! But wait. Wait.

197
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:22,853
What do I have to...?
Could I ask...?

198
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:26,398
Do you...? Lady?

199
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:34,739
Do I just hang around or do...?

200
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:39,286
For all of that, could you just...?
I'd like someone to...

201
00:13:39,494 --> 00:13:42,664
What do I have...?
Is there anything I have to do especial?

202
00:13:42,873 --> 00:13:45,208
Is there anything I have...?
Is there...?

203
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,002
I would like for all of that...

204
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:52,340
Could you...? No one's... I just wanna
know if I'm gonna get anything...

205
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:57,095
Could...? Would you mention...?
Just tell me what I have to... No.

206
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:59,764
Oh, could you possibly...?

207
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,517
Now, listen. And listen carefully.

208
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:05,645
This kid can and will be
whatever we want him to be.

209
00:14:05,854 --> 00:14:08,481
Except if we tip our mitt too early,
we may blow it.

210
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,193
Could someone...?
I just would like to know.

211
00:14:12,402 --> 00:14:14,737
You know, why I'm to know.

212
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:18,366
Oh, and, Harry, remember,
keep him glued down.

213
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:19,993
Don't let him get out of your sight,

214
00:14:20,201 --> 00:14:23,162
except when he's working with Chic or
any of the people we get to train him.

215
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,292
Me? To train me?

216
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,378
I'm either gonna be a fighter or a dog.

217
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:33,006
And they can have both
if they make me a boxer.

218
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,259
Why don't you sit here, Stanley,
next to me.

219
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:40,972
Oh, well, thank you very much,
but, you know, we haven't met as yet.

220
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,058
- I'm Ellen Betz.
- Oh, I'm glad to know you, Miss Betz.

221
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:46,394
How do you...? I'm very...
Well, I'm Stanley.

222
00:14:46,602 --> 00:14:48,563
- Do you know what I'm gonna do?
- Yes, I do, Stanley.

223
00:14:48,771 --> 00:14:51,399
- Tell me because I'd like to...
- You mustn't be concerned, Stanley,

224
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:54,861
because they simply want to
make you a star.

225
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:57,280
Well, at least, you know,
now I have an answer.

226
00:14:57,488 --> 00:14:59,407
I'm not up in the air
with a mystery in my mind,

227
00:14:59,615 --> 00:15:01,117
because that at least
gives me an answer.

228
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:04,078
Any time anyone's giving you
more than $100...

229
00:15:04,287 --> 00:15:06,247
Make me a star?

230
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:08,749
Now, relax, Stanley. Stanley, please.

231
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,378
Relax. I'll just...
I'll just try and explain it all.

232
00:15:12,586 --> 00:15:14,714
Stanley, please.

233
00:15:14,922 --> 00:15:18,551
I stop... You said...
I'm some... I don't, from the money...

234
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:21,637
- Stanley.
- And I knew... I had a... I'm so...

235
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:23,180
- I'm just...
- All right, Stanley.

236
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,723
Oh, yes, sir.

237
00:15:24,932 --> 00:15:27,518
She told me I was gonna be a star,
and it scared...

238
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,687
- Now, look, Stanley.
- Yeah, whatever you should say.

239
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,856
- We know all we need to know.
- Yeah.

240
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,024
And all you need to find out

241
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,861
- is what we tell you.
- Oh, wait a minute, Mr Fenelson...

242
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:41,365
Fergusson. Just what you tell me?
If it's dishonest or bad, I break out.

243
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,158
I don't... There's no lying and cheating.

244
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:45,619
You get another person
if it's bad things.

245
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:48,122
Stanley...

246
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,749
Do we look dishonest?

247
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,636
Well...

248
00:16:08,725 --> 00:16:11,395
No, I guess you're all OK.

249
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,772
Yeah, because the...
I always say that the eyes

250
00:16:13,981 --> 00:16:17,067
are the windows of the soul,
and if shades are up, then...

251
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:20,070
So I'll do whatever you want
because I'm your boy.

252
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,614
What's the first assignment?
What do...? I'll make me a star.

253
00:16:22,823 --> 00:16:24,574
A do-it-yourself famous.

254
00:16:25,325 --> 00:16:27,536
Bruce Arden, valet to the stars.
How are you, baby?

255
00:16:27,744 --> 00:16:29,621
Long time, no see.
Where you been hiding?

256
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,498
Deliveries in the rear, kid.
Love you.

257
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:35,085
So, what do you need? We've got all
kinds of new imports, Italian, French...

258
00:16:35,377 --> 00:16:36,795
This is Stanley.

259
00:16:37,003 --> 00:16:40,424
He's a friend. Stanley,
this is Sy Devore, clothier to the stars.

260
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,759
Give me five, baby.
Sorry, any friend of Bruce's

261
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:45,303
- is a friend of mine.
- Sy, cool it. We got business.

262
00:16:45,512 --> 00:16:47,514
Go, baby, go.
Business is my business.

263
00:16:47,722 --> 00:16:51,101
I've been telling Stanley how you outfit
all the big names of Hollywood.

264
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:54,479
True. Tab, Rock, Rip.
Name them, we've got them.

265
00:16:54,688 --> 00:16:56,022
That's wonderful.

266
00:16:56,231 --> 00:16:58,608
- What can you do for Stanley?
- Could you help me be good?

267
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,944
What does he need?
Shirts? Shorts? What?

268
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:06,616
Sy, the works.
You're looking at a future star.

269
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,162
You're kidding.

270
00:17:11,371 --> 00:17:14,791
Regardless, I want the whole
shooting match. Suit, tux, everything.

271
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:16,334
Anything you say.

272
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,462
- Let's start with a style.
- Yeah.

273
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,673
Now, who's your favourite star, kid?

274
00:17:21,881 --> 00:17:23,424
I like Hayley Mills a lot.

275
00:17:25,927 --> 00:17:27,929
Good. We'll start with purple capris.

276
00:17:28,137 --> 00:17:31,849
Stanley. He means who's your favourite
male movie star?

277
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:34,143
I love George Raft.

278
00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:35,979
George Raft. Perfect.

279
00:17:36,187 --> 00:17:38,231
We've got him. Made his first suit.
Come on, baby.

280
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:41,484
Oh, then I'll go with them.

281
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:44,821
Here, try this on. It's identical to one
I made for George Raft.

282
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:46,739
Oh, yeah?

283
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:53,579
Now, that's you.

284
00:18:05,383 --> 00:18:09,679
Son of a gun. It makes me look ju...
That's terrific.

285
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:11,430
I look just like George Raft.

286
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:13,849
Nothing to it, kid.
Now I'll get you the rest of the outfit.

287
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:16,936
Wait a minute. You better not.
I think I'm going somewhere.

288
00:18:17,144 --> 00:18:18,562
No. No. No, I'm not.

289
00:18:18,771 --> 00:18:20,564
Oh, that's the real George Raft.
Did you see him?

290
00:18:20,773 --> 00:18:22,817
- That wasn't me in the mirror...
- OK. OK, kid.

291
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:25,236
- He comes in here all the time.
- Oh, I never saw it.

292
00:18:25,444 --> 00:18:27,238
- It's a real movie thing.
- Look, do you want me

293
00:18:27,446 --> 00:18:29,365
- to get you the rest of the outfit now?
- Yeah...

294
00:18:29,573 --> 00:18:32,243
Sy, forget the stock suit
and trying how it feels and all that.

295
00:18:32,451 --> 00:18:35,371
- Let's get right to the fitting.
- OK, baby. Follow me.

296
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:40,042
To the fitting. If I can look like George,
I'd like to look like any movie star.

297
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:45,256
Not one of them... I mean... Who else
comes in besides George Raft?

298
00:19:16,995 --> 00:19:20,499
The four weeks was worth it, kid.
This is you.

299
00:19:20,707 --> 00:19:22,626
What, do you expect another fella?

300
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:25,045
You look splendid, Stanley.
How does it feel?

301
00:19:25,254 --> 00:19:27,714
Tight. Very tight. It's good-looking
and all that, but it's a very tight...

302
00:19:27,923 --> 00:19:29,257
That's not important.

303
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:31,927
Now, the next major move is
to get you looking and feeling

304
00:19:32,135 --> 00:19:35,931
just like any other ordinary, everyday,
run-of-the-mill, famous, rich star.

305
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:38,308
- No, I just wanna feel...
- Now, leave it to me.

306
00:19:38,517 --> 00:19:40,560
When it comes to materials
and performing,

307
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:42,270
we'll leave that to your stage mothers.

308
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:46,399
But for proper attire and appearance,
Bruce will call the shots.

309
00:19:46,608 --> 00:19:50,445
- Come with me.
- I'm going to the barber shop. OK.

310
00:19:53,156 --> 00:19:54,950
Hugh, are we next?

311
00:19:55,158 --> 00:19:56,493
You're next, Mr Arden.

312
00:19:56,701 --> 00:19:59,537
Oh, wait. I can do it. Wait, I...

313
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:04,376
I'm fine.
I tell you, I can do it myself.

314
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:07,003
Oh, this is wonderful.

315
00:20:07,212 --> 00:20:09,214
You wait four weeks
for a tailor-made suit,

316
00:20:09,422 --> 00:20:11,049
and in the same store,
there's a heist,

317
00:20:11,257 --> 00:20:13,051
so you gotta now go
and get another suit made.

318
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:15,053
No wonder he's making
so much money in the store.

319
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:17,138
- You're next, Stanley.
- What, for another fitting?

320
00:20:17,347 --> 00:20:20,016
No, no. The barber's waiting.

321
00:20:20,225 --> 00:20:24,479
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

322
00:20:26,356 --> 00:20:27,774
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

323
00:20:27,982 --> 00:20:29,776
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

324
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:37,283
If you can just pull it...

325
00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:38,993
Thanks.

326
00:20:41,412 --> 00:20:42,914
Oh, thank you.

327
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:45,833
That's a little tight.

328
00:20:50,672 --> 00:20:53,466
I'm... I'm ticklish.

329
00:21:20,993 --> 00:21:24,163
No. No. No. No. No.
Just no.

330
00:21:24,372 --> 00:21:26,957
No, I just don't... I don't...

331
00:22:21,678 --> 00:22:23,388
That's my sock.

332
00:22:32,314 --> 00:22:34,191
That's the shoe.

333
00:22:34,608 --> 00:22:36,443
It's the mate...

334
00:22:39,154 --> 00:22:41,406
I feel like Cinderella.

335
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:54,419
Oh, thank you very much.

336
00:23:40,215 --> 00:23:44,093
Be careful, sir.
Your nails are still wet.

337
00:24:18,586 --> 00:24:20,213
Perfect. Perfect.

338
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:45,154
Maybe he could get it weaved.

339
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,087
This way, folks.

340
00:25:07,384 --> 00:25:10,971
Young man, would you mind,
please, closing those doors?

341
00:25:11,638 --> 00:25:13,599
- Oh, these.
- Close them together.

342
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:16,018
Oh, all right.

343
00:25:25,736 --> 00:25:27,988
- They scooted...
- Stanley!

344
00:25:28,197 --> 00:25:30,240
Please be careful.

345
00:25:30,574 --> 00:25:34,912
Young man, that vase
is worth $7,000.

346
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,334
If you had broken it, that's exactly the
amount you would have had to pay...

347
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:42,919
...plus your life.

348
00:25:45,714 --> 00:25:47,174
Stanley...

349
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:49,885
...this is Professor Mueller.

350
00:25:50,218 --> 00:25:52,179
I must tell you, Stanley,
that besides being

351
00:25:52,387 --> 00:25:54,639
one of the world's most
renowned voice teachers,

352
00:25:54,848 --> 00:25:59,019
Professor Mueller is also a collector
of priceless antiques.

353
00:25:59,227 --> 00:26:03,815
Gee, that's very good. I had antique
flies and a butter... Bugs and but...

354
00:26:04,024 --> 00:26:06,067
- I had one bird, was 100 and...
- Wonderful.

355
00:26:06,276 --> 00:26:08,945
Now, if you will sit down, we will
discuss your forthcoming lessons.

356
00:26:09,154 --> 00:26:11,740
Yeah, I would just like
to talk about...

357
00:26:11,948 --> 00:26:13,909
If you don't mind,
I won't be staying, Professor.

358
00:26:14,117 --> 00:26:15,452
I have several things to do.

359
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,537
Well, of course,
but if you can see your way clear,

360
00:26:17,746 --> 00:26:19,831
do come back when you are finished
and have some tea.

361
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,501
Thank you, Professor, we'll see.
And, oh, Professor,

362
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,004
please be patient with Stanley.

363
00:26:26,546 --> 00:26:28,339
He's really very shy.

364
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:31,009
Don't worry your pretty little head
about that, Ellen.

365
00:26:31,217 --> 00:26:34,345
Me and music
always relaxes everyone.

366
00:26:34,554 --> 00:26:37,015
Thank you. Goodbye, professor.

367
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,305
That's a chair.

368
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:18,508
I caught it when it almost...

369
00:29:18,717 --> 00:29:24,139
Mr Fergusson's instructions to me
were to teach you to sing.

370
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:28,101
Have you any idea why?

371
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,770
Oh, yeah. Next week,
I'm supposed to record a record.

372
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:32,313
Next week!

373
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:35,191
You expect me to teach you
to sing in one week?

374
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,279
Well, I already know a lot
from in the shower, see, I sing...

375
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:42,449
That's very interesting.
Have you got maybe a sample?

376
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:44,033
Oh, yeah, I can give you a...

377
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:46,369
- A sample.
- Yeah.

378
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:48,371
Louder.

379
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:52,417
You got maybe another one?

380
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:56,588
- Inside you is maybe one more.
- Oh, I can squeal.

381
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:59,048
Maybe possibly one little one more?

382
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:02,218
No, what you need is noise,
more diaphragmatic breathing.

383
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:05,054
With greater volume
from the chest, like this.

384
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:23,156
That was very good,
your singing.

385
00:30:23,364 --> 00:30:26,450
- Is that all? There's no more?
- Now, listen.

386
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:28,327
Try this.

387
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:58,023
That's a good note.

388
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,430
Hold it!

389
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:31,849
Hold it! Hold it!

390
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:36,145
Give me more of that...
More of that, then give me that.

391
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:40,190
Come on, Stanley.
Come on, Stanley.

392
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:45,487
Stanley, this is the A and R man
of Poverty Records, Mayo Sloan.

393
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:47,030
Oh, how do you do?

394
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,574
I said how do you do.

395
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,993
Speak up, son! My name's Sloan.
What's yours?

396
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,912
- Stanley.
- It's a pleasure, Handley.

397
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,831
No, it's Stanley.

398
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,792
No! It's Sloan, Manley!
Mayo Sloan!

399
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:00,335
He's a little hard of hearing.

400
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:02,629
Mayo is known as a "hit maker"!

401
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,840
He made a hit record
with The Four Rats called

402
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,384
<i>You Broke My Heart When
You Broke My Comb.</i>

403
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,344
Oh, then he must be very smart.

404
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,680
Art? I thought your name was Manley!

405
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,142
<i>He also made Rotten Romance
with The Six Slobs!</i>

406
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,477
Well, then he knows music
very good.

407
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,396
I got a natural ear for it.

408
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,273
Well, you're very grateful.

409
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,526
Go ahead, let's go out in the studio
and let's get started.

410
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,112
Hold it!

411
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,282
Hold it. Hold it.

412
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,034
All right, here's the tempo.

413
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:35,036
Let's try it once from the start.
Here we go.

414
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:36,705
- One. Two.
- Hold it!

415
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:40,083
Louie, the kid's coming out.
We'll do it with him.

416
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,420
- Are you Stanley?
- Well, after that, I'm not too sure.

417
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,046
Let's try it from the top, Stanley.

418
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,048
OK, boys, here's the tempo.

419
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:48,675
One, two.

420
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,712
Hold it! Hold it!

421
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,340
Louie, I need more voice from the trio.

422
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,425
One, two.

423
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:08,087
You think he'll be all right?

424
00:34:08,295 --> 00:34:10,047
- That's just what I was gonna ask.
- Just fine.

425
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:13,467
<i>All he has to do on this Teenage
Dance Time show is mouth his record.</i>

426
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,344
He just has to mouth the record.

427
00:34:15,552 --> 00:34:17,638
We had no choice anyway.
The record's been out one week,

428
00:34:17,846 --> 00:34:19,473
and already it's pushing
for number one spot.

429
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,850
- You sure that's the right channel?
- That's it, Caryl.

430
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:24,645
Don't you see the show is on already?
Can't you see the kids dancing?

431
00:34:24,853 --> 00:34:26,855
They're moving up and down, Caryl.

432
00:35:02,974 --> 00:35:04,893
Look kind of cute, don't they?

433
00:36:04,244 --> 00:36:07,038
I'm sorry.
They were playing our tune.

434
00:36:07,247 --> 00:36:09,540
Oh, Stanley, you're too much.

435
00:36:09,749 --> 00:36:12,377
Oh, yeah, I like to do that.

436
00:36:12,585 --> 00:36:14,671
You really like the simple things,
don't you?

437
00:36:14,879 --> 00:36:18,424
Oh, yeah, of course.
The hard ones always give me trouble.

438
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:20,426
- Stanley, I checked with the booth.
- Yeah.

439
00:36:20,635 --> 00:36:22,970
And they're going to play
this final dance number for the kids,

440
00:36:23,179 --> 00:36:26,474
- and then you're on.
- Oh, I'm glad.

441
00:36:27,642 --> 00:36:29,102
Ellen, did you ever think back...?

442
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,145
I mean, did you ever try
to go back in your memory

443
00:36:31,354 --> 00:36:34,440
and think back about something
that happened a long time ago?

444
00:36:34,649 --> 00:36:37,360
- Well, certainly, Stanley.
- Yeah.

445
00:36:37,568 --> 00:36:40,571
Especially the tender, nice things.

446
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,114
Yeah.

447
00:36:42,323 --> 00:36:45,201
The things we wish would still prevail.

448
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:50,456
But since they don't, we try
to bring them back by reminiscing.

449
00:36:51,123 --> 00:36:53,125
Yeah, I was gonna say that too.

450
00:36:53,334 --> 00:36:54,794
Yeah, well, I do that a lot.

451
00:36:55,002 --> 00:36:56,420
I always do that.

452
00:36:56,629 --> 00:36:59,465
But sometimes they're not nice,
what you're reminiscing.

453
00:36:59,673 --> 00:37:01,675
Then why do you try
to remember them?

454
00:37:01,884 --> 00:37:03,260
Oh, I don't try, the bad parts.

455
00:37:03,469 --> 00:37:04,970
I mean... I didn't mean...

456
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:09,600
I mean, I'm watching the kids dancing
and hugging, and it was nice to see.

457
00:37:09,809 --> 00:37:13,896
<i>And I couldn't help but think
about a night a long, long time ago</i>

458
00:37:14,104 --> 00:37:17,107
<i>and with a girl
that you remind me of.</i>

459
00:43:54,918 --> 00:43:58,338
<i>Well, maybe it wasn't
a good memory...</i>

460
00:43:58,881 --> 00:44:02,551
...but it felt good
talking about it anyhow.

461
00:44:02,759 --> 00:44:04,887
Of course it was good.

462
00:44:05,637 --> 00:44:08,515
The sweet things
and the good things

463
00:44:08,724 --> 00:44:11,518
aren't always the things
that make us better people.

464
00:44:12,978 --> 00:44:17,065
I think the heartaches,
the unpleasant things...

465
00:44:18,191 --> 00:44:21,445
...even the heavy burdens
we've had placed upon us

466
00:44:21,653 --> 00:44:24,239
make us stronger in the long run.

467
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:29,578
Oh, yes, it's nice to have
pretty memories.

468
00:44:29,786 --> 00:44:33,623
And our hearts are happier
when pain doesn't exist.

469
00:44:34,124 --> 00:44:37,169
But bad is a test.

470
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:41,965
If we can carry on
after a bad thing happens...

471
00:44:43,091 --> 00:44:44,426
...then we've grown up some.

472
00:44:46,595 --> 00:44:48,263
Don't you agree?

473
00:44:53,643 --> 00:44:55,603
You're a nice lady.

474
00:44:57,314 --> 00:44:58,773
I know that.

475
00:44:58,982 --> 00:45:01,985
All right, now it's time for that portion
of our programme that we set aside

476
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:03,820
for our guest performer.

477
00:45:04,028 --> 00:45:06,698
And today's guest is someone
I know you're all going to enjoy.

478
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,867
Here he is, in person,

479
00:45:09,075 --> 00:45:11,119
the young man with
the number one record in the country,

480
00:45:11,327 --> 00:45:14,122
<i>I Lost My Heart in a Drive-in Movie,
Stanley Belt!</i>

481
00:45:23,089 --> 00:45:25,341
<i>Welcome to Teenage Dance Time,
Stanley.</i>

482
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:27,635
I always will.

483
00:45:27,885 --> 00:45:31,306
Yes. How does it feel
having the number one...

484
00:45:31,514 --> 00:45:33,308
- Oh, good.
...hit record in the country?

485
00:45:33,516 --> 00:45:36,644
I mean, it's one...
I'm very glad. It's good.

486
00:45:36,853 --> 00:45:40,148
And I wanna thank everyone
that wants to hear it

487
00:45:40,356 --> 00:45:42,108
and everybody that wants to get it.

488
00:45:42,316 --> 00:45:45,778
Because if it wasn't for them,
then only we'd know about it.

489
00:45:53,286 --> 00:45:56,330
Who the devil told him to talk?

490
00:45:56,539 --> 00:46:00,167
Now, take it easy, Caryl.
He's gonna start mouthing in a minute.

491
00:46:00,376 --> 00:46:02,795
His mouth isn't doing too bad
right now.

492
00:46:03,045 --> 00:46:06,215
And I always say buying a record
is like owning a possession.

493
00:46:06,424 --> 00:46:08,509
If it's yours, you can lose it.

494
00:46:08,718 --> 00:46:10,094
Good.

495
00:46:11,053 --> 00:46:14,849
And now, kids, Stanley Belt
will now mouth his newest recording,

496
00:46:15,057 --> 00:46:18,102
<i>I Lost My Heart in a Drive-in Movie.</i>

497
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:43,836
<i>Picked her up at seven
On Friday night</i>

498
00:46:44,044 --> 00:46:47,548
<i>Kissed her till 11
And held her tight</i>

499
00:46:47,756 --> 00:46:51,176
<i>I lost my heart
In the drive-in</i>

500
00:46:51,635 --> 00:46:54,430
<i>Movie</i>

501
00:46:54,638 --> 00:46:57,766
<i>Say, up there on the big screen
A movie star</i>

502
00:46:57,975 --> 00:47:01,562
<i>While we played a love scene
In my car</i>

503
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:05,065
<i>I lost my heart
In a drive-in</i>

504
00:47:05,607 --> 00:47:08,402
<i>Movie</i>

505
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:13,240
<i>Say, I bought her a hamburger
A cheeseburger and tater chips</i>

506
00:47:13,448 --> 00:47:18,328
<i>I wasn't a bit hungry
I just wanted to taste her lips</i>

507
00:47:18,537 --> 00:47:21,373
<i>Gonna try to reach her
Each Friday night</i>

508
00:47:21,581 --> 00:47:25,252
<i>Any double feature
Will suit me right</i>

509
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:28,630
<i>I lost my heart
In the drive-in</i>

510
00:47:28,964 --> 00:47:32,092
<i>Love played a part
In a drive-in</i>

511
00:47:32,342 --> 00:47:36,179
<i>I lost my heart
In a drive-in</i>

512
00:47:36,805 --> 00:47:40,225
<i>Movie
Yeah, yeah</i>

513
00:47:40,433 --> 00:47:43,395
<i>Right in the movie</i>

514
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:45,313
<i>In my car</i>

515
00:49:07,061 --> 00:49:09,272
- Hi, Harry.
- Well, Stanley. How are you?

516
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,524
- All right. What's happening?
- You're just in time.

517
00:49:11,732 --> 00:49:14,110
We're gonna start a little game
called the "race for space".

518
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,153
And it concerns you, so sit down.

519
00:49:16,362 --> 00:49:18,114
Oh, yeah, you're gonna
shoot me up in something?

520
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:20,991
No, no, no. I'm talking about
space in a newspaper.

521
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,618
We gotta get your name
in the newspaper,

522
00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:24,245
- get people talking about you.
- Yeah.

523
00:49:24,453 --> 00:49:26,580
See, in the old days,
we'd have you bathing in champagne

524
00:49:26,789 --> 00:49:29,667
- or committing suicide.
- That sounds wonderful. I love that.

525
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:32,711
But today you do the same thing
and never have to leave the office.

526
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,588
- You see that red phone over there?
- Yeah.

527
00:49:34,797 --> 00:49:36,882
That is the hotline.

528
00:49:37,091 --> 00:49:38,551
You're calling Khrushchev about me?

529
00:49:38,759 --> 00:49:40,678
Somebody more important
than Khrushchev.

530
00:49:40,886 --> 00:49:42,221
- Who?
- Hedda.

531
00:49:42,429 --> 00:49:45,224
- "Who-dda"?
- Hedda. Hedda Hopper!

532
00:49:45,432 --> 00:49:48,769
But I don't call her, she will call me.

533
00:49:48,978 --> 00:49:51,730
You see, she has the most fantastic
nose for news in the world.

534
00:49:51,939 --> 00:49:54,900
If I were to call her and tell her what a
sensational new discovery I had here,

535
00:49:55,109 --> 00:49:57,695
she'd drop it in a little box
that said "press agents",

536
00:49:57,903 --> 00:50:00,781
and then they get thrown out with
the rest of the trash in the morning.

537
00:50:00,989 --> 00:50:05,411
Instead, I start a little story
around town about you.

538
00:50:05,619 --> 00:50:07,079
Yeah, yeah.

539
00:50:07,287 --> 00:50:09,206
And I let it nourish,

540
00:50:09,414 --> 00:50:11,291
and I let it grow.

541
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:15,212
And then we sit back and wait
for the red phone to beckon.

542
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,089
Hey, you got a buck?

543
00:50:17,297 --> 00:50:19,383
Yeah, that's all I have left
from rehearsal.

544
00:50:19,591 --> 00:50:21,468
Last time I tried this,

545
00:50:21,677 --> 00:50:23,303
Hedda called in four minutes
and 48 seconds.

546
00:50:23,512 --> 00:50:25,555
Well, I got a buck says
she calls in four minutes flat.

547
00:50:25,764 --> 00:50:27,224
- Bet?
- You got a bet.

548
00:50:27,474 --> 00:50:30,268
Now, Stanley,
just to start the ball rolling...

549
00:50:30,477 --> 00:50:33,438
...where would you go if you wanted
to hear some real hot gossip?

550
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:37,275
Where would I go if I wanted...?

551
00:50:38,652 --> 00:50:41,279
- Barber shop, beauty parlour?
- Perfect!

552
00:50:41,696 --> 00:50:43,949
Perfect. The centre of American
cultural exchange.

553
00:50:44,157 --> 00:50:45,951
- The beauty parlour.
- Start timing, Stanley.

554
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:48,203
All right. One.
If I win the buck, it'll be

555
00:50:48,411 --> 00:50:49,913
two, because he put one,
is two...

556
00:50:50,121 --> 00:50:52,457
Three, four, five seconds.
Six seconds.

557
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:54,334
Seven seconds. And if I lose...

558
00:50:54,626 --> 00:50:56,086
Hello, Harry, what's up?

559
00:50:56,294 --> 00:50:58,672
Listen, I wonder if you'd do me a favour.
We got a young kid here,

560
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,216
and some of the network boys
have been nosing around about him.

561
00:51:01,424 --> 00:51:03,385
They seem to think
he's gonna be a pretty hot item,

562
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:05,470
but they won't commit themselves,
you know.

563
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:08,306
I wonder if you could find out for me
what they got in mind for him.

564
00:51:08,515 --> 00:51:10,433
They have a funny kid under contract.

565
00:51:10,642 --> 00:51:13,895
One of the networks wants to build
a whole show around him.

566
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:17,649
Yeah. Barney, do me a favour,
will you?

567
00:51:17,857 --> 00:51:20,777
See what you can find out about him
and get back to me, will you, sweetie?

568
00:51:20,985 --> 00:51:22,654
Say, why don't we have any dope
on this new kid

569
00:51:22,862 --> 00:51:25,532
that Fergusson has under contract?
"What kid"?

570
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:29,327
Only the funniest new comic that's
come along in years, that's what kid.

571
00:51:29,536 --> 00:51:31,538
Listen, if Barney wants him,
I want him.

572
00:51:31,746 --> 00:51:34,207
The networks have already signed him.
He's supposed to be the greatest.

573
00:51:34,415 --> 00:51:36,167
I want that kid, Paul.

574
00:51:36,376 --> 00:51:39,879
I know talent when I see it, and
that kid's got it. Now, get him for me.

575
00:51:40,088 --> 00:51:41,422
OK.

576
00:51:51,349 --> 00:51:52,809
Hello?

577
00:51:53,017 --> 00:51:55,353
Yes, this is Harry Silver.

578
00:51:55,561 --> 00:51:59,690
Hedda, what a pleasant surprise. Yes.

579
00:51:59,899 --> 00:52:01,359
What, dear?

580
00:52:01,567 --> 00:52:03,110
A new young comic.

581
00:52:03,319 --> 00:52:07,323
Oh, yes, you must mean Stanley, yes.

582
00:52:07,532 --> 00:52:09,033
Well, he's...

583
00:52:09,242 --> 00:52:11,744
He's young. He's very funny.

584
00:52:11,953 --> 00:52:13,496
He's good-looking.

585
00:52:13,704 --> 00:52:15,039
Yes.

586
00:52:15,289 --> 00:52:16,999
No, really, Hedda.
I think that this kid's

587
00:52:17,208 --> 00:52:20,419
going to have a real big chance
in this crazy old town of ours.

588
00:52:20,628 --> 00:52:23,297
Yes. Well, you must meet him. Yes.

589
00:52:23,798 --> 00:52:26,842
Well, how does anyone
meet anyone, sweetie?

590
00:52:49,114 --> 00:52:51,867
Morgan, Chic, Ellen, I'm here.

591
00:52:52,076 --> 00:52:55,496
And we can let the good times roll.

592
00:52:57,539 --> 00:52:58,874
Well, well, well.

593
00:52:59,083 --> 00:53:01,293
- So glad you could come.
- Thank you.

594
00:53:01,502 --> 00:53:03,087
The guest of honour
has finally arrived.

595
00:53:03,295 --> 00:53:04,671
- Yes.
- Do you know that the party

596
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,341
is only supposed
to last for three hours?

597
00:53:07,549 --> 00:53:09,218
Only three hours.

598
00:53:09,426 --> 00:53:11,345
Oh, yeah, well, OK.
I know I'm late, I'm sorry.

599
00:53:11,553 --> 00:53:13,388
But instead of a lot of "Hello"s,

600
00:53:13,597 --> 00:53:15,641
I'll just throw a couple of
quick "Hi, sweetie"s around.

601
00:53:15,849 --> 00:53:17,476
Will that be all right?

602
00:53:17,893 --> 00:53:20,521
- Well, that would make it faster.
- I see you finally made it.

603
00:53:20,729 --> 00:53:22,439
- I finally made it.
- Now, these newspapermen

604
00:53:22,648 --> 00:53:24,399
- are very important to your career.
- Very important.

605
00:53:24,608 --> 00:53:26,276
- I want you to play it cool.
- I'll play it cool.

606
00:53:26,485 --> 00:53:28,987
I want you to show them how happy
and thrilled you are to meet them.

607
00:53:29,196 --> 00:53:31,239
And I want you to be
extra-specially sweet,

608
00:53:31,448 --> 00:53:32,908
humble and nice, you got it?

609
00:53:33,116 --> 00:53:35,410
Yeah. I'll be just as sweet and humble.

610
00:53:35,619 --> 00:53:38,789
- Well, not too sweet, Stanley.
- No, I wasn't...

611
00:53:38,997 --> 00:53:40,916
These people are used to
the soft sell

612
00:53:41,124 --> 00:53:43,293
and the phony approach
to getting names in the papers.

613
00:53:43,502 --> 00:53:45,045
So if I may suggest,

614
00:53:45,253 --> 00:53:48,423
just be yourself:
Honest and sincere.

615
00:53:48,632 --> 00:53:51,426
Honest and sincere.

616
00:53:51,635 --> 00:53:53,261
He answers everything everyone...

617
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:56,097
Ellen's right, Harry.
If this kid gets the cutes, we're dead.

618
00:53:56,306 --> 00:53:58,642
- Well, I won't get the cutes.
- Will you all stop worrying?

619
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:00,560
- Come on, Stanley.
- I won't get the cutes...

620
00:54:00,769 --> 00:54:03,772
Oh, hiya, fellas. Vern, Dick, Joe.

621
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,482
Stanley, this is Vern Scott.

622
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:08,151
- I'm very...
- Richard Gehman, this is Stanley Belt.

623
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,153
- I'm very...
- Joe Finnegan, Stanley.

624
00:54:10,362 --> 00:54:11,696
- Hi.
- Stanley,

625
00:54:11,905 --> 00:54:14,282
these gentlemen write for
all the newspapers and magazines

626
00:54:14,491 --> 00:54:16,534
- all over the world.
- Oh, yeah.

627
00:54:16,743 --> 00:54:18,536
Sweet. Humble.

628
00:54:18,745 --> 00:54:20,455
- Nice.
- Yeah, I remember.

629
00:54:20,663 --> 00:54:23,708
Oh, you're the Mr Scott
that writes in the...

630
00:54:23,917 --> 00:54:28,713
It's a wonderful, sweet paper,
the way you make your column.

631
00:54:28,922 --> 00:54:30,381
- Too sweet.
- Too swe...

632
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:33,176
You're Richard Gehman,
that very famous...

633
00:54:33,384 --> 00:54:36,638
And my heart is humble,
the way you write, lovely humble.

634
00:54:36,846 --> 00:54:38,181
- Not that humble.
- Not that...

635
00:54:38,389 --> 00:54:40,391
And Mr Finnegan,
I'd love to have golf.

636
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,185
Maybe one saccharine day
we could have lunch,

637
00:54:42,393 --> 00:54:43,728
you and I, sweetie.
What do you say?

638
00:54:43,937 --> 00:54:45,271
- Too nice.
- Too nice?

639
00:54:48,066 --> 00:54:50,610
Stanley, these are sharp people.

640
00:54:50,818 --> 00:54:52,653
- They know you're putting them on.
- Oh, no...

641
00:54:52,862 --> 00:54:54,364
Relax.

642
00:54:57,992 --> 00:54:59,535
There's Hedda.
She must have just come in.

643
00:55:08,252 --> 00:55:09,670
Stanley.

644
00:55:22,558 --> 00:55:24,226
Did you see that?

645
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,774
I thought it was so darn funny!

646
00:55:34,779 --> 00:55:36,405
Stanley.

647
00:55:41,952 --> 00:55:44,914
Don't worry, fellas, I'll get him.

648
00:55:49,502 --> 00:55:54,173
Stanley, could I see you
for a minute, please? Stanley.

649
00:55:54,632 --> 00:55:56,842
Well, gentlemen...

650
00:55:57,301 --> 00:55:59,720
...here goes the clean-up.

651
00:56:02,014 --> 00:56:03,599
Hey, Hedda, sweetie.

652
00:56:03,807 --> 00:56:05,434
I gotta tell you about this kid.

653
00:56:05,643 --> 00:56:08,187
No, Harry, I'll tell you.

654
00:56:08,395 --> 00:56:11,940
He's the first real funny thing
I've seen around here in ages.

655
00:56:12,149 --> 00:56:14,693
And he's right.
This thing is a horror.

656
00:56:14,902 --> 00:56:17,446
Well, if you say so, Hedda.
It is a pretty funny hat.

657
00:56:17,654 --> 00:56:19,448
You know, this kid had us
believing he was serious.

658
00:56:19,656 --> 00:56:22,117
- I told you he was funny.
- Now, wait a minute, Harry.

659
00:56:22,326 --> 00:56:24,912
And this goes for you too, Fergusson.

660
00:56:25,746 --> 00:56:30,209
You've come across somebody
who hasn't yet learned to be phony.

661
00:56:30,417 --> 00:56:33,086
He thought something and he said it,

662
00:56:33,295 --> 00:56:35,297
which was real and honest.

663
00:56:35,505 --> 00:56:38,091
And now, if you apply
that to his performance,

664
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,052
you've got a great success.

665
00:56:40,677 --> 00:56:42,304
Come on, fellas, lend a hand.

666
00:56:42,512 --> 00:56:47,559
I can't make it on my own
with this stupid umbrella hat.

667
00:56:50,145 --> 00:56:51,480
Was I right?
Was I right?

668
00:56:51,688 --> 00:56:53,982
Am I ever wrong? Isn't that right,
Sydney? Is the kid great?

669
00:56:54,191 --> 00:56:55,984
Is that kid funny? Is that...?

670
00:56:56,193 --> 00:56:58,487
You heard what she said, didn't you?
Don't take my word for it.

671
00:56:58,695 --> 00:57:00,030
Just listen to what Hedda said.

672
00:57:00,238 --> 00:57:02,866
Wonderful! Right.
You bet. Oh, you doll.

673
00:57:06,244 --> 00:57:09,706
Rhonda, darling, how are you,
and how's the picture going?

674
00:57:09,915 --> 00:57:11,875
Oh, fine, fine, thank you.

675
00:57:12,083 --> 00:57:13,918
- How are you?
- Wonderful, wonderful.

676
00:57:14,127 --> 00:57:16,755
Did I have a ball last night
at Cary Grant's.

677
00:57:16,963 --> 00:57:20,675
Stanley Belt was there,
and he's too much.

678
00:57:20,884 --> 00:57:23,428
Oh, yes. I know.

679
00:57:23,636 --> 00:57:25,263
He seems like a very nice guy.

680
00:57:25,472 --> 00:57:27,682
Have you seen him?

681
00:57:27,891 --> 00:57:29,642
Have I seen him?

682
00:57:29,851 --> 00:57:32,479
Sweetie, only his first night in town.

683
00:57:32,687 --> 00:57:34,022
I think it was the Friars CI...

684
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:35,648
Yes, yes, the Friars affair.

685
00:57:35,857 --> 00:57:37,567
Oh, he was simply hilarious.

686
00:57:39,319 --> 00:57:42,655
Hey, Mel, have you heard
about this new kid, Stanley Belt?

687
00:57:42,864 --> 00:57:44,699
Yeah. You know, I hear he's a gas.

688
00:57:44,908 --> 00:57:46,576
That's a funny thing,
the other night at Chasen's,

689
00:57:46,784 --> 00:57:48,244
everybody was wigging
about the guy.

690
00:57:48,453 --> 00:57:49,996
They say he cuts every comic around.

691
00:57:50,913 --> 00:57:52,290
Good morning, Mr Wynn.

692
00:57:52,498 --> 00:57:54,167
Oh, good morning, Alec.

693
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:57,253
Say, Mr Wynn, have you heard
anything about this new comedian,

694
00:57:57,462 --> 00:57:58,880
Stanley Belt?

695
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:03,718
That's all I've been hearing about
for the last four weeks,

696
00:58:03,926 --> 00:58:05,720
but where can anybody see him?

697
00:58:05,928 --> 00:58:07,930
Well, are they hiding him?
Where's he working?

698
00:58:08,139 --> 00:58:10,099
- Beats me.
- Well, I'll tell you what.

699
00:58:10,308 --> 00:58:12,643
If you find out anything,
will you let me know, Alec?

700
00:58:12,852 --> 00:58:14,395
Please do that because I...

701
00:58:14,604 --> 00:58:18,399
I would love to see what I've been
raving about, you know?

702
00:58:19,025 --> 00:58:22,361
- I mean, I wanna do...
- No, no, no, no!

703
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:23,905
Now, Stanley.

704
00:58:24,113 --> 00:58:25,823
Once more, listen to me.

705
00:58:29,535 --> 00:58:31,329
Please, Stanley, baby.

706
00:58:32,288 --> 00:58:33,664
Listen.

707
00:58:34,457 --> 00:58:35,916
Ladies and gentlemen,

708
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:38,627
I'd like to introduce myself,

709
00:58:38,836 --> 00:58:40,880
but I don't know me either.

710
00:58:42,923 --> 00:58:45,634
I'd like to introduce myself,
but I don't know you...

711
00:58:45,843 --> 00:58:47,261
No! No!

712
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:50,514
"Me"! It's "me", not "you"! It's "me"!

713
00:58:50,723 --> 00:58:52,475
That's right. "I don't know me". I don't...

714
00:58:52,683 --> 00:58:55,436
I'd like to introduce...
I say...

715
00:58:55,644 --> 00:58:57,062
Introduce. Introduce.

716
00:58:57,271 --> 00:58:59,690
I'd like to intro...
I'm going to intro... I'm...

717
00:58:59,899 --> 00:59:01,442
- Impossible.
- I'd like to be impossible.

718
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:03,152
No, not you. It's imposs...

719
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,237
- Don't just sit there, Harry.
- I don't like to...

720
00:59:05,446 --> 00:59:06,780
- I need help.
- I'd like to help.

721
00:59:06,989 --> 00:59:09,491
- I need help, do you hear me?
- He needs help.

722
00:59:10,326 --> 00:59:11,660
You're only gonna
get yourself upset.

723
00:59:11,869 --> 00:59:15,122
- You don't wanna upset that boy.
- Good evening, upset.

724
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:16,665
- Stanley.
- Yeah.

725
00:59:16,874 --> 00:59:18,208
- Stanley, why don't we go...
- Sorry.

726
00:59:18,417 --> 00:59:22,004
...way back down and do the joke
in the routine about the dog?

727
00:59:22,212 --> 00:59:23,964
Oh, you mean about the dog
that chases the cars.

728
00:59:24,173 --> 00:59:25,507
- Yeah!
- Hey! Hey!

729
00:59:25,716 --> 00:59:27,050
How about that!

730
00:59:27,259 --> 00:59:28,927
Oh, yeah, I got a car
that chases dogs.

731
00:59:29,136 --> 00:59:31,513
- No, no...
- Stanley.

732
00:59:31,722 --> 00:59:33,557
It's a dog that chases dogs!

733
00:59:33,765 --> 00:59:36,476
There. Now try it softly.
See how... Try it softly.

734
00:59:36,685 --> 00:59:39,646
- It's not me, it's you! You!
- Harry...

735
00:59:39,855 --> 00:59:41,189
Oh, I'm sorry.

736
00:59:41,398 --> 00:59:44,192
You can't get upset at a time like this.
Calm down.

737
00:59:44,401 --> 00:59:46,737
You should calm down
because I get upset if he's upset.

738
00:59:46,945 --> 00:59:48,322
- Will you relax?
- Yeah.

739
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:50,073
Stanley. Slower?

740
00:59:50,282 --> 00:59:51,742
- Slower?
- Slower. Yeah, all right.

741
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:53,910
I...

742
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:55,620
...got...

743
00:59:55,829 --> 00:59:57,289
...a dog...

744
00:59:57,497 --> 00:59:58,957
...that...

745
00:59:59,166 --> 01:00:00,750
...chases...

746
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,879
Stanley. Not that slow.

747
01:00:04,087 --> 01:00:06,173
Not that slow.
I got a fast car with a big dog.

748
01:00:06,381 --> 01:00:08,049
- No, Stanley.
- No.

749
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:10,260
You're in your living room
at home, right?

750
01:00:10,468 --> 01:00:13,513
- Yeah.
- And you sit down and you relax.

751
01:00:13,722 --> 01:00:15,056
Isn't that the way
you wrote it, Chic?

752
01:00:16,182 --> 01:00:18,351
Yeah, see. You relax.

753
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,020
You're talking to friends.

754
01:00:20,228 --> 01:00:21,813
And say it like I'm just talking...?

755
01:00:22,022 --> 01:00:23,982
Talking to your friends, that's right.

756
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:27,360
You know, we got these
new drapes and a new...

757
01:00:27,569 --> 01:00:30,030
I don't believe it!

758
01:00:30,697 --> 01:00:33,533
- I give up.
- You give up?

759
01:00:33,742 --> 01:00:35,076
Well, I give up!

760
01:00:35,285 --> 01:00:37,162
This thing ain't gonna work anyhow.

761
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:41,416
It's like making a sow's pig
out of a person's ear.

762
01:00:42,792 --> 01:00:45,712
A silk purse out of a sow's ear.

763
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,547
That's exactly right.

764
01:00:47,755 --> 01:00:49,757
And I didn't ask for this.
I had a good job.

765
01:00:49,966 --> 01:00:52,093
And I was very happy.
And you people come along

766
01:00:52,302 --> 01:00:54,846
and you try to make me
something out of what I'm not.

767
01:00:55,054 --> 01:00:57,056
And that's...
And I don't need it.

768
01:00:57,265 --> 01:00:59,976
And I'm not happy,
and everybody else is miserable.

769
01:01:00,184 --> 01:01:02,895
So I quit. And that's final.

770
01:01:03,104 --> 01:01:05,398
And it's over and the end.

771
01:01:05,606 --> 01:01:08,526
I don't want this heartache
and I don't... I'm just finished.

772
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:11,320
I quit... Want... I don't need...

773
01:01:11,529 --> 01:01:12,864
Hi, Stanley.

774
01:01:13,072 --> 01:01:16,742
Oh, hello, Ellen, you're just in time.
We gotta find us a new boy.

775
01:01:16,951 --> 01:01:18,494
Yeah. With Stanley quitting,

776
01:01:18,703 --> 01:01:21,664
looks like we're gonna have to
find somebody else.

777
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:23,833
Stanley?

778
01:01:24,584 --> 01:01:26,794
Oh, I might have been a little hasty.

779
01:01:27,003 --> 01:01:30,506
That's OK, Stanley.
Anybody can make a stupid mistake.

780
01:01:30,715 --> 01:01:33,634
All right, then, Stanley, come on, let's
get down here and take it from the top.

781
01:01:33,843 --> 01:01:35,177
- Yeah.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

782
01:01:35,386 --> 01:01:38,222
I would like to... Oh, listen, Ellen,
you'd better get lots of sandwiches.

783
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:40,599
We're gonna be here
into the wee small hours.

784
01:01:40,808 --> 01:01:43,644
Stanley opens his act
at the Copa in exactly four days.

785
01:01:43,853 --> 01:01:46,230
Let's go, Stanley.
Ladies and gentlemen,

786
01:01:46,439 --> 01:01:48,441
- I'd like to...
- Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna...

787
01:01:48,649 --> 01:01:52,945
About a car that I...
In four... Four... Four days!

788
01:01:53,154 --> 01:01:55,072
Stanley!

789
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:03,873
ONE NIGHT ONLY
STANLEY BELT

790
01:02:34,027 --> 01:02:36,113
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Rex Ozgood,

791
01:02:36,321 --> 01:02:38,532
- your master of ceremonies.
- Hooray.

792
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:40,117
Oh, yeah?

793
01:02:40,325 --> 01:02:43,829
I'd like to present the first in a series
of five theatrical extravaganzas

794
01:02:44,037 --> 01:02:47,082
presented each evening here
at the beautiful Copa Caf.

795
01:02:47,291 --> 01:02:51,044
The only nightclub in Bussman County
with tables for ladies.

796
01:02:52,212 --> 01:02:54,548
- Good luck to you.
- Oh, thank you very much.

797
01:02:54,756 --> 01:02:57,175
I'd like to present one of the
greatest dancers in show business,

798
01:02:57,384 --> 01:02:59,344
The Four Step Brothers.

799
01:04:51,622 --> 01:04:52,790
Boy, they're murder.

800
01:04:52,998 --> 01:04:54,333
Take me back to Boston.

801
01:04:54,542 --> 01:04:56,877
- They'll eat you alive.
- What a crowd.

802
01:04:58,337 --> 01:05:00,965
And now, folks, I'd like to present
a new find, a young comic

803
01:05:01,173 --> 01:05:03,801
who'll make every laugh you ever had
feel like a tear of sorrow.

804
01:05:04,927 --> 01:05:06,637
Yes, siree, folks. Here he is,

805
01:05:06,846 --> 01:05:10,015
for the first time
at the Copa Caf, Stanley Belt.

806
01:05:59,481 --> 01:06:02,526
Good evening...
Good evening, friendly folks

807
01:06:02,734 --> 01:06:05,320
and people.

808
01:06:06,863 --> 01:06:09,491
A funny thing
ought to happen now...

809
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:11,451
Should have... On the way here.

810
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:15,163
Like my dog chased the car a lot.

811
01:06:15,372 --> 01:06:17,791
Speaking of my uncle, he...

812
01:06:17,999 --> 01:06:20,502
He said I'm a psycho ceramic.

813
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:23,380
And I said, "Oh?

814
01:06:23,588 --> 01:06:26,299
"What's that?"
And he said, "A crackpot."

815
01:06:28,301 --> 01:06:30,136
My uncle said it.

816
01:06:32,973 --> 01:06:35,892
Then I have an aunt.

817
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,437
I mean, I have a...

818
01:06:39,646 --> 01:06:42,857
And she's very absent-minded.

819
01:06:43,066 --> 01:06:44,943
And one day...

820
01:06:46,611 --> 01:06:49,489
...she had an itch and she poured
syrup down her back

821
01:06:49,697 --> 01:06:51,866
and scratched her waffle.

822
01:06:57,789 --> 01:06:59,290
Don't give me that look, Caryl.

823
01:06:59,499 --> 01:07:02,085
This is not mine, none of it. Honest.

824
01:07:02,293 --> 01:07:04,712
This kid's been reading without me.

825
01:07:07,215 --> 01:07:08,716
Are there any requests?

826
01:07:08,925 --> 01:07:11,219
Yeah! Get off!

827
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:13,304
I appre... Thank you.

828
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:16,265
Then I could do a number.

829
01:07:16,474 --> 01:07:17,809
My hit record.

830
01:07:18,017 --> 01:07:20,144
Would anyone like to see that?

831
01:07:21,145 --> 01:07:22,480
Oh, wonderful.

832
01:07:22,688 --> 01:07:24,440
Then I'll do that.

833
01:07:30,196 --> 01:07:32,406
I have this...

834
01:07:36,369 --> 01:07:39,163
Who told him to do that?

835
01:07:48,923 --> 01:07:50,466
I could hum a part of it.

836
01:07:52,718 --> 01:07:54,762
Since you love jokes,

837
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:56,430
that'd be good, then.

838
01:08:00,184 --> 01:08:03,187
And since the phonograph...

839
01:08:03,395 --> 01:08:06,190
...wasn't good,
then maybe I could...

840
01:08:06,398 --> 01:08:08,108
...remember the song by heart.

841
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:11,820
It would be better
if I remembered it by mouth.

842
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:16,492
Well, it goes:

843
01:08:20,079 --> 01:08:22,581
<i>Picked her up at seven
On Friday night</i>

844
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:25,250
<i>Kissed her till 11
And I held on to her tight</i>

845
01:08:25,459 --> 01:08:30,172
<i>I lost my heart in my car
While I drove it</i>

846
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:39,139
And there's more like that.

847
01:08:40,057 --> 01:08:41,517
Of that song.

848
01:08:43,393 --> 01:08:45,020
<i>Picked her and I hugged her</i>

849
01:08:51,151 --> 01:08:53,779
Sounds like a bottle opening.

850
01:08:56,573 --> 01:08:58,700
I do noises.

851
01:09:00,619 --> 01:09:02,829
Do you wanna hear more of that song?

852
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:13,924
Ready.

853
01:09:14,883 --> 01:09:16,635
A blindfold, at least.

854
01:09:16,843 --> 01:09:18,762
Aim.

855
01:09:18,970 --> 01:09:20,722
Don't.

856
01:09:21,056 --> 01:09:22,390
I'll make you more noise.

857
01:09:22,599 --> 01:09:23,892
Fire.

858
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:29,189
Outside of a little stage fright,

859
01:09:29,397 --> 01:09:30,732
Stanley was great.

860
01:09:30,941 --> 01:09:33,068
Let's say he has possibilities.

861
01:09:33,276 --> 01:09:35,028
Let's say that.

862
01:09:35,236 --> 01:09:38,156
Stanley? Was it stage fright?

863
01:09:38,782 --> 01:09:40,367
Well...

864
01:09:40,575 --> 01:09:42,827
...if you would call...

865
01:09:43,036 --> 01:09:45,580
...a stage about to run
over you a fright... Yeah.

866
01:09:45,789 --> 01:09:48,708
It was a...
A frightened stage scared.

867
01:09:49,667 --> 01:09:52,253
Also amnesia, shock and frostbite.

868
01:09:52,462 --> 01:09:54,756
I could've had that too,
the way I felt.

869
01:09:54,964 --> 01:09:57,842
Look, Chic, the kid
is gonna be all right.

870
01:09:58,051 --> 01:10:00,512
We just found out
something in time, that's all.

871
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,847
Yeah, that we got the wrong guy.

872
01:10:03,056 --> 01:10:06,517
No. We just have to
work harder, that's all.

873
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,917
What do you think, Caryl?

874
01:11:13,709 --> 01:11:16,629
You mean about our boy wonder?

875
01:11:17,463 --> 01:11:19,089
Who else?

876
01:11:20,007 --> 01:11:21,342
Well...

877
01:11:22,051 --> 01:11:25,804
...just between you and me,
it looks pretty bleak.

878
01:11:27,056 --> 01:11:28,807
I know what you mean.

879
01:11:29,016 --> 01:11:31,769
We might have been
a little hasty, huh?

880
01:11:33,562 --> 01:11:36,482
Well, I think if we were smart...

881
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:39,693
...the best thing we could do would
be just to forget the whole thing.

882
01:11:39,902 --> 01:11:42,529
- I'm hip.
- Just the guys I wanna see.

883
01:11:42,738 --> 01:11:45,532
Paul, I've got no time
for Madison Avenue.

884
01:11:45,949 --> 01:11:49,161
Wait here.
Caryl, I want that kid.

885
01:11:49,912 --> 01:11:51,497
- What kid?
- Come on,

886
01:11:51,705 --> 01:11:53,665
you know who I'm talking about.
You're putting me on.

887
01:11:53,874 --> 01:11:56,418
- Paul, take it easy.
- Take it easy?

888
01:11:56,627 --> 01:11:58,378
Look, Caryl, we've been
friends for a long time.

889
01:11:58,587 --> 01:12:00,589
Personal friends.
I'm asking a personal favour.

890
01:12:00,797 --> 01:12:02,883
Well, I'm trying to do you
a personal favour.

891
01:12:03,091 --> 01:12:05,260
You never did
a personal favour for anybody.

892
01:12:05,469 --> 01:12:07,596
- Look, the kid is really not that great...
- Sure, yeah.

893
01:12:07,804 --> 01:12:09,598
- I know all...
- He's levelling with you, Paul.

894
01:12:09,806 --> 01:12:11,391
Never mind the truth bits.

895
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,268
Who made you the big offer,
Johnson's network?

896
01:12:13,477 --> 01:12:15,354
We had a break-in with this kid
in a small joint...

897
01:12:15,562 --> 01:12:18,231
I'm doubling Johnson's high bid,
is that fair? I'm asking, is that fair?

898
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,442
Look, you're too nice a guy,
I couldn't do it to you...

899
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:22,486
I'll triple it. Here,
here's a contract, read it.

900
01:12:22,694 --> 01:12:25,197
Triple is as far as I can go.
That's big loot!

901
01:12:25,405 --> 01:12:27,574
I'm tripling it. Triple
is as far as I can...

902
01:12:28,283 --> 01:12:32,704
Now, Stanley, you sit right down
at my desk, in my chair, and sign.

903
01:12:32,913 --> 01:12:35,457
Oh, it's a very good thrill,
thank you,

904
01:12:35,665 --> 01:12:39,002
to sit in your chair and...

905
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:41,046
Well, it looks so...

906
01:12:41,254 --> 01:12:43,715
There's a lot of fine writing here

907
01:12:43,923 --> 01:12:45,759
and a lot of things.
Shouldn't I read it?

908
01:12:45,967 --> 01:12:48,094
You know, just to know
what it says...

909
01:12:48,303 --> 01:12:50,096
No, no, no, that won't
be necessary, Stanley.

910
01:12:50,305 --> 01:12:53,099
I've read it all very carefully,
and it's all in order.

911
01:12:53,308 --> 01:12:56,728
Well, then, all right.
It looks very important.

912
01:12:57,145 --> 01:12:59,731
"Lmportant", he says.

913
01:13:04,486 --> 01:13:06,738
Yeah, I thought it was important.

914
01:13:06,946 --> 01:13:08,448
Stanley.

915
01:13:08,656 --> 01:13:10,992
- Yes.
- You know, I think I can safely say

916
01:13:11,201 --> 01:13:14,662
that with the signing of this contract,
we're on our way.

917
01:13:14,871 --> 01:13:17,665
- Our little plan is working.
- Yeah, really?

918
01:13:18,833 --> 01:13:22,629
<i>Stanley, you're gonna be
on The Ed Sullivan Show.</i>

919
01:13:22,837 --> 01:13:24,797
Oh, from the audience?

920
01:13:27,258 --> 01:13:28,593
"From the audience".

921
01:13:29,135 --> 01:13:31,137
Isn't that cute?

922
01:13:31,512 --> 01:13:35,683
No, Stanley, you're gonna
be a star, on the stage.

923
01:13:35,892 --> 01:13:37,226
I'll take a drink to that.

924
01:13:37,435 --> 01:13:39,812
You'd take a drink when
your laundry gets back.

925
01:13:40,021 --> 01:13:41,355
Oh, funny, Chic.

926
01:13:41,564 --> 01:13:44,025
Now, now. No, no.
Hold it, hold it.

927
01:13:44,233 --> 01:13:47,320
- I think a toast is perfectly in order.
- All right, boss. All right, boss.

928
01:13:47,528 --> 01:13:50,406
- How about some champagne?
- Yeah, great!

929
01:13:50,615 --> 01:13:52,867
Well, don't just stand there.
Get it.

930
01:13:53,075 --> 01:13:54,952
Yeah, I'm gonna serve it
because I'm a star,

931
01:13:55,161 --> 01:13:58,080
so I should go get it and everything.
It's in the refrigerator. Star, huh?

932
01:13:58,289 --> 01:13:59,832
Sure, from the audience.
I'm such a star.

933
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:01,959
Oh, this is a terrific system.

934
01:14:02,168 --> 01:14:04,170
I'm the star,
and I gotta wait on them.

935
01:14:04,378 --> 01:14:06,714
Oh, that's what they mean,
the star system.

936
01:14:07,298 --> 01:14:09,675
Instant waiter.
Do-it-yourself room service.

937
01:14:09,884 --> 01:14:11,427
Room service?
Send me up a room.

938
01:14:11,635 --> 01:14:14,096
Fine star. I gotta go serve...

939
01:14:16,515 --> 01:14:19,310
That's champagne, yes.

940
01:14:21,395 --> 01:14:22,980
Opener.

941
01:14:24,315 --> 01:14:26,192
Need an opener for...

942
01:14:28,736 --> 01:14:30,863
No champagne opener.

943
01:14:31,238 --> 01:14:33,407
Maybe they have an opener.

944
01:14:34,325 --> 01:14:36,452
Just enough glasses.
Beautiful glasses.

945
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:37,995
I have all of that, but...

946
01:14:38,203 --> 01:14:39,955
- Oh, well, look who's here...
- But I couldn't...

947
01:14:40,164 --> 01:14:42,624
I'm sorry, I couldn't find an opener.
I looked all over.

948
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:45,502
Stanley, you don't use a bottle
opener with champagne.

949
01:14:45,711 --> 01:14:47,337
- Open it.
- He said to open it...

950
01:14:47,546 --> 01:14:49,047
Oh, yeah.
Well, I don't know, because...

951
01:14:49,673 --> 01:14:53,385
Oh, that's a very exciting thing,
like a block party.

952
01:14:53,594 --> 01:14:56,263
If we had cold cuts, it would be good.

953
01:14:56,472 --> 01:15:00,142
Thank you. It must...
I meant, for taking it.

954
01:15:01,226 --> 01:15:02,561
Thank you very much.

955
01:15:02,769 --> 01:15:05,063
You don't use straws
with this, you...

956
01:15:05,397 --> 01:15:07,858
These are the kind of glasses
you throw in the fireplace and break

957
01:15:08,066 --> 01:15:11,778
<i>so when they run away, the lady
can cry, like Prince Valiant movies.</i>

958
01:15:12,613 --> 01:15:14,781
Well, here's to Stanley Belt.

959
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:18,660
The product of six great minds
working as one.

960
01:15:18,869 --> 01:15:21,496
Six great minds.
One, two, three, four, five, six.

961
01:15:21,705 --> 01:15:24,249
Six great... That...
You're out because...

962
01:15:24,458 --> 01:15:25,917
Oh, you're the... I'm not in.

963
01:15:26,126 --> 01:15:28,253
He's the sixth, I'm not.

964
01:15:28,462 --> 01:15:29,921
Well.

965
01:15:30,547 --> 01:15:33,425
It's cold.
Sure, because it's got ice in it.

966
01:15:37,387 --> 01:15:38,722
Now.

967
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:40,432
We need more breaking in.

968
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:43,018
So it's back to the Copa Caf.

969
01:15:43,768 --> 01:15:45,937
And I think we should set it up

970
01:15:46,146 --> 01:15:48,815
<i>for the night before
The Sullivan Show.</i>

971
01:15:49,024 --> 01:15:50,358
- How does that sound?
- Perfect.

972
01:15:50,567 --> 01:15:51,901
- Sounds good to me.
- Fine.

973
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:54,696
All right. We meet here tomorrow.

974
01:15:54,904 --> 01:15:56,239
Goodnight, all.

975
01:15:56,448 --> 01:15:57,782
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

976
01:15:57,991 --> 01:15:59,325
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

977
01:16:00,744 --> 01:16:02,287
Stanley...

978
01:16:02,662 --> 01:16:04,247
Stanley?

979
01:16:05,165 --> 01:16:06,958
Stanley?

980
01:16:15,175 --> 01:16:17,051
Stanley?

981
01:16:22,265 --> 01:16:23,641
Come on out of there.

982
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:27,145
I got scared
from the break-in again.

983
01:16:27,353 --> 01:16:30,815
Well, it's... It made me
frightened to go back there.

984
01:16:31,024 --> 01:16:32,567
Again, I have to go back.

985
01:16:32,775 --> 01:16:34,193
I'm very embarrassed.

986
01:16:34,402 --> 01:16:36,654
When I heard about
another break-in, I got...

987
01:16:36,863 --> 01:16:39,073
I hate to think...
That scared me.

988
01:16:39,282 --> 01:16:41,117
Oh, Stanley, you mustn't worry.

989
01:16:41,325 --> 01:16:42,827
Really, you mustn't.

990
01:16:52,587 --> 01:16:53,921
You've made it.

991
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:56,591
- You really did.
- Yeah, well.

992
01:16:56,799 --> 01:16:58,134
And now,

993
01:16:58,342 --> 01:17:01,596
are you gonna buy me dinner,
or do I have to call the bell captain

994
01:17:01,804 --> 01:17:04,932
and have him send up
some clumsy kid with ice cubes?

995
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:10,354
Yeah, you mean
like when I was first here.

996
01:17:10,563 --> 01:17:14,525
How clumsy. It's amazing
how time can change a person.

997
01:17:14,734 --> 01:17:16,652
Yeah. Dinner? Buy? Me?

998
01:17:16,861 --> 01:17:19,530
A date to go in at...
Oh, yeah.

999
01:17:19,738 --> 01:17:21,449
But I gotta get Fergusson.
I don't have enough.

1000
01:17:21,657 --> 01:17:24,368
I've got a token for a bus. I've gotta
get an advance. I'll be back.

1001
01:17:30,457 --> 01:17:32,501
- Sir.
- Good evening.

1002
01:18:02,114 --> 01:18:03,782
For you.

1003
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,910
"Garcon."

1004
01:18:07,744 --> 01:18:09,121
Belt, a table.

1005
01:18:09,329 --> 01:18:11,498
And a very pleasant
good evening to you, sir,

1006
01:18:11,707 --> 01:18:14,293
and to you, my lovely lady,

1007
01:18:14,501 --> 01:18:16,837
a good, good evening.

1008
01:18:17,045 --> 01:18:19,715
Hey, hey, hey.
What's with the kissing?

1009
01:18:19,923 --> 01:18:22,050
We're standing and kissing,
we came for eating and drinking,

1010
01:18:22,259 --> 01:18:23,593
and you're just kissing.

1011
01:18:23,802 --> 01:18:25,470
I have a reservation for a table.

1012
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:27,806
I'd like a table for the lady and me,
if you don't mind.

1013
01:18:28,014 --> 01:18:29,766
- Very well, sir.
- Thank you.

1014
01:18:29,975 --> 01:18:32,144
- Right this way, please.
- This way, a fine table for you.

1015
01:18:32,352 --> 01:18:34,354
Thank you. You're welcome.

1016
01:18:34,563 --> 01:18:36,356
Such kissing, I never saw...
They always kiss.

1017
01:18:36,565 --> 01:18:38,275
I hope the food is
as abundant as the kissing.

1018
01:18:38,483 --> 01:18:39,901
Madame?

1019
01:18:40,902 --> 01:18:42,612
Stay here.

1020
01:18:43,321 --> 01:18:45,282
I know how to duel.

1021
01:18:59,921 --> 01:19:02,507
I thought I was supposed... OK.

1022
01:19:03,049 --> 01:19:06,970
Oh, I'm sorry, I sat before you.
I didn't mean to...

1023
01:19:07,178 --> 01:19:08,680
Thank you very much.

1024
01:19:08,888 --> 01:19:11,933
Oh, we would like to order...

1025
01:19:12,142 --> 01:19:14,144
Oh, yes, thank you very much, sir.

1026
01:19:14,352 --> 01:19:16,646
- Thank you very much.
- Well, would you...?

1027
01:19:16,855 --> 01:19:18,189
That's quite all right.

1028
01:19:18,398 --> 01:19:20,066
And a very good evening
to you, madam and sir.

1029
01:19:20,275 --> 01:19:21,985
Would you like to order
a drink before dinner?

1030
01:19:22,193 --> 01:19:24,696
- Yes, we'd like two.
- Of what, sir?

1031
01:19:24,904 --> 01:19:26,614
That'll be fine.

1032
01:19:26,823 --> 01:19:28,491
- Champagne cocktail.
- Champagne.

1033
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:30,827
That's exactly what
I had in mind, champagne...

1034
01:19:31,035 --> 01:19:33,663
Champagne cocktail.
Thank you, sir.

1035
01:19:33,871 --> 01:19:35,748
No, she's... I'm sir.

1036
01:19:35,957 --> 01:19:37,500
Thank you very much, sir.
Right away, sir.

1037
01:19:37,709 --> 01:19:39,836
- You're very...
- Stanley, as far as tipping is concer...

1038
01:19:40,044 --> 01:19:41,379
Your menu, madam.

1039
01:19:41,587 --> 01:19:44,173
Oh, that's good, I'll order.

1040
01:19:45,049 --> 01:19:46,384
- Your menu, sir.
- Thank you.

1041
01:19:46,592 --> 01:19:48,136
And let me...
Here you are.

1042
01:19:48,344 --> 01:19:50,471
Here's some for you
because I appreciate it.

1043
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:52,723
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

1044
01:19:52,932 --> 01:19:54,392
- Your drinks are coming.
- I hope so.

1045
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,686
I'm gonna make a toast that is...

1046
01:19:56,894 --> 01:19:58,855
A drink for the lady.

1047
01:19:59,063 --> 01:20:00,523
A drink for the gentleman.

1048
01:20:00,731 --> 01:20:03,901
Thank you.
Here's to you for being very good.

1049
01:20:04,110 --> 01:20:05,444
- Thanks.
- Thank you very much.

1050
01:20:05,653 --> 01:20:08,322
Well, there's two, so...

1051
01:20:08,531 --> 01:20:10,741
- Why, that's very gracious of you...
- Well, let me...

1052
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:13,536
Because I like people
to enjoy also.

1053
01:20:13,744 --> 01:20:15,830
Well, you're very kind, I'm...

1054
01:20:17,581 --> 01:20:18,958
- You know...
- Yes, sir.

1055
01:20:19,166 --> 01:20:20,501
You give a little and...

1056
01:20:22,253 --> 01:20:23,921
I think that's all I'm gonna...

1057
01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:26,549
Maybe... OK.

1058
01:20:28,467 --> 01:20:30,553
A toast would be a good...

1059
01:20:32,805 --> 01:20:34,890
I think the butter
went on your purse then.

1060
01:20:35,099 --> 01:20:38,060
Here, but let me... Also, here,
because you were good.

1061
01:20:38,269 --> 01:20:39,645
- Thanks.
- Thank you, sir.

1062
01:20:39,853 --> 01:20:43,023
Stanley. You're really going to
have to slow down a bit.

1063
01:20:43,232 --> 01:20:46,902
Yes, but I still have 13...
Here's to...

1064
01:22:15,323 --> 01:22:18,910
<i>That's why I'm so happy to be
popular demand back at the Copa Caf.</i>

1065
01:22:19,119 --> 01:22:21,412
<i>And remember about my dog
always chasing cars?</i>

1066
01:22:21,621 --> 01:22:23,164
<i>Well, he finally caught one,
a Mustang,</i>

1067
01:22:23,373 --> 01:22:25,667
<i>and he buried it
in the backyard.</i>

1068
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,418
<i>That's a gag.</i>

1069
01:22:27,627 --> 01:22:29,045
<i>And I'll do a lot of other gags.</i>

1070
01:22:29,254 --> 01:22:31,214
<i>Tomorrow night you can...
I'm gonna be Ed Sullivan.</i>

1071
01:22:31,422 --> 01:22:34,842
<i>I mean, on Ed Sullivan.
I mean, I'll be on his show if...</i>

1072
01:23:13,089 --> 01:23:14,799
Sit down, kids.

1073
01:23:15,007 --> 01:23:16,717
What's up, Caryl?

1074
01:23:21,263 --> 01:23:22,723
Well, I...

1075
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,810
I realise that...

1076
01:23:27,728 --> 01:23:29,438
Well, I...

1077
01:23:29,647 --> 01:23:32,900
I mean, if you stop to...

1078
01:23:33,109 --> 01:23:34,443
...consider...

1079
01:23:34,652 --> 01:23:36,278
Just what are you trying to say?

1080
01:23:36,487 --> 01:23:39,073
He's not trying.
He's telling us that we blew it

1081
01:23:39,281 --> 01:23:41,742
and it was a bad idea
to begin with.

1082
01:23:41,951 --> 01:23:44,245
I gotta figure out some way
to handle the press. I don't...

1083
01:23:44,453 --> 01:23:46,330
Look, take my advice, don't even try.

1084
01:23:46,538 --> 01:23:50,042
I, for one, am leaving for the Springs
in about 15 minutes.

1085
01:23:50,251 --> 01:23:51,585
You what?

1086
01:23:51,794 --> 01:23:53,545
You heard me, I'm leaving.

1087
01:23:53,754 --> 01:23:56,465
Well, what about Stanley?
He goes on in an hour.

1088
01:23:56,674 --> 01:23:58,550
When they see how bad
our king of comedy is,

1089
01:23:58,759 --> 01:24:00,094
they'll eat us up alive.

1090
01:24:00,302 --> 01:24:02,262
We'd be out of our minds
to hang around, get it?

1091
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:04,765
You mean you're gonna let him
go through with that show

1092
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:07,851
and whatever happens
afterwards, all alone?

1093
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:09,394
Well, he has to.

1094
01:24:09,603 --> 01:24:11,605
He signed a contract, right?

1095
01:24:11,814 --> 01:24:14,316
Because he trusted us.

1096
01:24:14,525 --> 01:24:15,859
Ellen.

1097
01:24:16,068 --> 01:24:18,278
It won't be that bad.

1098
01:24:18,779 --> 01:24:22,282
He'll stumble through the Sullivan
caper like he did in that small club,

1099
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:24,785
and then he'll silently steal away.

1100
01:24:24,993 --> 01:24:27,329
And then he'll become a bellboy again.

1101
01:24:27,537 --> 01:24:29,915
- It's that simple?
- It's the only way, Ellen.

1102
01:24:30,123 --> 01:24:33,251
I did send him a letter
by messenger, explaining.

1103
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:35,921
You sent him a letter?
Well, how nice.

1104
01:24:36,129 --> 01:24:40,509
Yes. Matter of fact,
I've got a copy of it right here.

1105
01:24:40,717 --> 01:24:42,177
You made a copy.

1106
01:24:42,386 --> 01:24:44,471
Well, then, why don't you read it to me.

1107
01:24:44,888 --> 01:24:46,848
I was going to.

1108
01:24:47,766 --> 01:24:49,309
"Dear Stanley,

1109
01:24:49,518 --> 01:24:53,104
"sometimes what seems to be
a great idea can go so radically wrong

1110
01:24:53,313 --> 01:24:54,981
"that it's best to forget it

1111
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:57,817

1112
01:24:58,026 --> 01:25:00,111
"Unfortunately,

1113
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,447
"because of your
signature on a contract,

1114
01:25:02,656 --> 01:25:05,241

1115
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:11,039
"The results are so obvious to all of us
that we felt it best not to be there.

1116
01:25:11,873 --> 01:25:14,167
"We wish you luck

1117
01:25:14,376 --> 01:25:17,420
"and hope you get
your old job back at the hotel."

1118
01:25:18,671 --> 01:25:21,341
And it's signed Caryl,

and Ellen.

1122
01:25:27,013 --> 01:25:28,431
Ellen?

1123
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:31,017
What right did you have
to sign my name

1124
01:25:31,226 --> 01:25:33,895
to that disgraceful piece of paper?

1125
01:25:34,103 --> 01:25:37,941
Oh, you've got a lot of nerve
when it comes to writing letters.

1126
01:25:38,149 --> 01:25:41,444
It's too bad you don't have
enough to stick by him now.

1127
01:25:41,653 --> 01:25:44,948
Well, look, we know how you feel,
Ellen, but what can we do?

1128
01:25:45,156 --> 01:25:46,824
Well, I know what I can do.

1129
01:25:47,033 --> 01:25:50,953
I can try and get to that theatre
before that messenger does.

1130
01:25:51,162 --> 01:25:54,540
Ellen, what good would that do now?

1131
01:25:54,749 --> 01:25:56,584
What good?

1132
01:25:56,793 --> 01:25:58,461
I can let him know

1133
01:25:58,669 --> 01:26:01,672
that I'm going to stick through it
with him to the very end,

1134
01:26:01,881 --> 01:26:03,716
no matter how bad.

1135
01:26:03,925 --> 01:26:06,052
And I can also let him know

1136
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:07,720
that I love him.

1137
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:10,223
And that's good.

1138
01:26:13,935 --> 01:26:15,895
<i>Fifteen minutes to air.
That's fifteen minutes to air.</i>

1139
01:26:16,103 --> 01:26:18,230
<i>Orchestra on stage, please.</i>

1140
01:26:19,231 --> 01:26:21,484
Fifteen, did you sa...?

1141
01:26:21,692 --> 01:26:24,195
Fifteen...
Well, where's everybody?

1142
01:26:50,471 --> 01:26:52,765
Say, does anybody know...?
Oh, usher man.

1143
01:26:52,973 --> 01:26:54,308
Did you see any of my staff?

1144
01:26:54,516 --> 01:26:56,143
I mean, the...
The people that are work...

1145
01:26:56,352 --> 01:26:59,813
- Any of my... And Ellen, did you?
- No. I haven't seen anyone, Mr Belt.

1146
01:27:00,022 --> 01:27:02,358
- Well, could you look to see?
- I could look in the theatre if you'd like.

1147
01:27:02,566 --> 01:27:05,152
- Why don't you look in the theatre.
- Glad to, Mr Belt.

1148
01:27:05,361 --> 01:27:07,237
I'm so happy about it.

1149
01:27:16,246 --> 01:27:17,706
Where can they be?

1150
01:27:17,915 --> 01:27:19,625
It's not...

1151
01:27:20,501 --> 01:27:23,086
There you are.
Where you been? I'm waiting...

1152
01:27:23,295 --> 01:27:25,923
I'm sorry, Mr Belt, but I couldn't
find any of your staff.

1153
01:27:26,131 --> 01:27:28,133
Oh, I just picked up
this special delivery letter.

1154
01:27:28,342 --> 01:27:31,219
- It just arrived by special messenger.
- Thank you very much.

1155
01:27:31,428 --> 01:27:34,139
A spe... Thank you.

1156
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:38,352

01:27:59,623 --> 01:28:01,333

"The results are so obvious."

1163
01:28:05,503 --> 01:28:07,297
They are, huh?

1164
01:28:09,716 --> 01:28:12,218
I'll show them results.

1165
01:28:13,136 --> 01:28:14,971
I'll show them results.

1166

1169
01:28:46,586 --> 01:28:48,129
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1170
01:28:48,338 --> 01:28:52,842
Tonight we have
a really big show because,

1171
01:28:53,051 --> 01:28:56,596
once again, we have
an exciting TV first.

1172
01:28:56,804 --> 01:28:59,223
As you remember, here on this stage,
Richard Burton,

1173
01:28:59,432 --> 01:29:01,851
Audrey Hepburn,
the Beatles,

1174
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:04,103
Martin and Lewis,
all made their debuts.

1175
01:29:04,312 --> 01:29:07,398
And tonight, on this very stage here,

1176
01:29:07,607 --> 01:29:09,484
for the very first time,

1177
01:29:09,692 --> 01:29:11,736
here on this stage is the young man
you've heard about,

1178
01:29:11,944 --> 01:29:13,446
read about, talked about,

1179
01:29:13,654 --> 01:29:17,742
the young comedian who has
literally taken the country by storm.

1180
01:29:17,950 --> 01:29:20,828
And I won't keep you from him,
ladies and gentlemen, because

1181
01:29:21,037 --> 01:29:23,205
here he is on our stage here,

1182
01:29:23,414 --> 01:29:26,042
this here really
quite big stage tonight,

1183
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:29,629
for the first time here or anywhere,
tonight or any night,

1184
01:29:29,837 --> 01:29:31,964
the young man who has taken...

1185
01:29:32,173 --> 01:29:35,092
Here he is right now,
so without further ado,

1186
01:29:35,301 --> 01:29:36,719
Stanley Belt.

1187
01:29:36,927 --> 01:29:40,514
In "A Big Night In Hollywood".

1188
01:29:57,031 --> 01:29:59,116
Hello, movie thing.

1189
01:29:59,325 --> 01:30:02,661
Hey, cop? Officer,
could you get my autograph?

1190
01:30:08,083 --> 01:30:10,627
Oh, there's Claudette Calvin.

1191
01:30:11,628 --> 01:30:14,673
Fred MacM...
I know them all by heart.

1192
01:30:15,966 --> 01:30:18,010
Rock Raisin, Rex Boiman.

1193
01:30:18,218 --> 01:30:19,595
Oh, I don't know his name.

1194
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:26,101
Is Marlon Belvin gonna be here?

1195
01:30:27,186 --> 01:30:30,522
Gregory Purpin, what's his...?
Gregory, Rolman Peck.

1196
01:30:30,731 --> 01:30:32,900
Marlon Peck and Gregory White.

1197
01:30:33,108 --> 01:30:34,776
I never remember,
but I know their faces.

1198
01:30:34,985 --> 01:30:38,280
All right, folks, let's break it up.
Let's keep it moving.

1199
01:30:49,583 --> 01:30:50,917
Helen.

1200
01:30:51,126 --> 01:30:54,880
Helen! Helen! Helen!

1201
01:30:55,088 --> 01:30:56,506
Will you listen?

1202
01:30:56,715 --> 01:30:58,967
No, you listen.

1203
01:30:59,593 --> 01:31:04,181
To the sound of these
balcony tickets hitting the floor.

1204
01:31:04,389 --> 01:31:06,641
Helen!

1205
01:35:40,246 --> 01:35:42,373
Have any of you read
the trade papers this morning?

1206
01:35:42,623 --> 01:35:44,792
You don't have to look at the trades,
it's in every paper.

1207
01:35:45,001 --> 01:35:48,337
<i>He even made the front page
of the Times: "A star is born."</i>

1208
01:35:50,715 --> 01:35:53,634
Did you see him last night?
Did you?

1209
01:35:53,843 --> 01:35:56,971
Do you believe that kid?
Can you believe him?

1210
01:35:57,179 --> 01:36:00,141
I tell you, it was the greatest thing
I ever saw in my life,

1211
01:36:00,349 --> 01:36:02,560
and the people loved it.

1212
01:36:03,143 --> 01:36:04,645
You know what
the greatest thing was?

1213
01:36:04,854 --> 01:36:08,482
He didn't use one line
or one bit that we gave him.

1214
01:36:08,691 --> 01:36:11,110
- That I gave him.
- He just winged the whole thing,

1215
01:36:11,318 --> 01:36:12,820
and he was great.

1216
01:36:13,028 --> 01:36:17,616
Then why on earth did you ask us
all to come here and send us the wire?

1217
01:36:17,825 --> 01:36:19,368
None of us can work
with him anymore,

1218
01:36:19,576 --> 01:36:21,620
after the way we walked out on him.

1219
01:36:21,829 --> 01:36:24,790
Why did I ask you?
I didn't ask anybody.

1220
01:36:24,998 --> 01:36:27,543
I was in the Springs
when I got Harry's wire.

1221
01:36:27,751 --> 01:36:30,796
Harry's wire? The only wire
I got was from you.

1222
01:36:31,004 --> 01:36:33,340
Listen, if this is somebody's
idea of a joke,

1223
01:36:33,549 --> 01:36:35,926
I don't think it's very funny.

1224
01:36:36,135 --> 01:36:38,428
Ellen, did you have anything
to do with this?

1225
01:36:38,637 --> 01:36:39,972
Not a thing.

1226
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:42,724
The wire I received was signed
Caryl Fergusson,

1227
01:36:42,933 --> 01:36:44,476
and that's all I know.

1228
01:36:46,103 --> 01:36:49,189
Well, all I know is...

1229
01:36:54,861 --> 01:36:56,196
Excuse me.

1230
01:36:56,405 --> 01:36:59,366
I sent those telegrams.

1231
01:37:00,242 --> 01:37:02,411
Now, I...

1232
01:37:03,495 --> 01:37:05,789
I didn't mean to be deceitful,
it's just that...

1233
01:37:05,997 --> 01:37:08,542
Well, you know, I wanted to...

1234
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:11,878
...talk to all of you just once more.

1235
01:37:12,087 --> 01:37:14,589
I'm sorry, Stanley, I...

1236
01:37:15,131 --> 01:37:16,925
I don't know...

1237
01:37:17,133 --> 01:37:19,761
...what else we can say, except...?

1238
01:37:20,762 --> 01:37:22,097
Well, I...

1239
01:37:22,305 --> 01:37:25,976
I just guess we were all
a bunch of gutless wonders.

1240
01:37:26,893 --> 01:37:28,436
I feel the same way, kid.

1241
01:37:30,563 --> 01:37:32,357
My best wishes, Stan.

1242
01:37:32,774 --> 01:37:34,234
I like you, kid.

1243
01:37:34,776 --> 01:37:36,861
May I make it unanimous?

1244
01:37:37,070 --> 01:37:40,115
Sure. Well, thank you, I'm...

1245
01:37:40,323 --> 01:37:42,117
Hey, wait a minute.

1246
01:37:42,325 --> 01:37:43,952
Wait a minute. I...

1247
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:47,580
I think I have to clarify something here.
I mean, this isn't a wake, you know.

1248
01:37:47,789 --> 01:37:49,499
I sent the telegrams not because
this is a finish,

1249
01:37:49,707 --> 01:37:51,042
it's because it's the beginning.

1250
01:37:51,251 --> 01:37:52,585
There's a lot of things
I think we have to do.

1251
01:37:52,794 --> 01:37:54,754
I got a lot of confidence from
everything that's happened.

1252
01:37:54,963 --> 01:37:56,798
Chic, maybe we can do
some new jokes with the car

1253
01:37:57,006 --> 01:37:59,467
and the chasing dogs. We could
update it a little bit, you know?

1254
01:37:59,676 --> 01:38:01,094
Caryl, could you get
Las Vegas for me?

1255
01:38:01,302 --> 01:38:02,762
I mean, call Jack and set a deal.

1256
01:38:02,971 --> 01:38:04,305
Whatever you set, it'll be good.

1257
01:38:04,514 --> 01:38:07,100
Bruce, what about a new wardrobe,
like a whole Ronald Romance?

1258
01:38:07,308 --> 01:38:08,935
Handsome, I should look.
We've gotta do...

1259
01:38:09,143 --> 01:38:11,145
Oh, yeah, and I'm gonna need
a new secretary, Caryl.

1260
01:38:11,354 --> 01:38:14,107
Don't forget that, because
I'm gonna need a secretary.

1261
01:38:14,315 --> 01:38:17,026
You know, you gotta have a secretary,
with correspondence and all that.

1262
01:38:17,235 --> 01:38:18,569
Now, look here, Stanley.

1263
01:38:18,778 --> 01:38:20,488
Ellen had absolutely nothing
to do with this.

1264
01:38:20,696 --> 01:38:23,866
Of course not. I wrote that letter
and I signed all the names.

1265
01:38:24,075 --> 01:38:25,785
- Ellen didn't even...
- Fine. I still say

1266
01:38:25,993 --> 01:38:27,787
I need a new secretary.
I'm entitled, right?

1267
01:38:27,995 --> 01:38:30,289
And I want a new secretary.
And that's final.

1268
01:38:30,832 --> 01:38:34,835
Because no wife of mine is
going to be working late at night

1269
01:38:35,044 --> 01:38:36,754
and getting stuck in traffic jams.

1270
01:38:36,963 --> 01:38:39,924
She's staying home, taking care
of the children and the laundry.

1271
01:38:40,132 --> 01:38:42,802
Like any other... Well...

1272
01:38:43,010 --> 01:38:44,845
They must be glad about it.

1273
01:38:45,054 --> 01:38:49,308
When I say I have a wife that does,
she'll... And I'll also.

1274
01:38:49,517 --> 01:38:51,769
Well, don't get mad,
because I only was teasing.

1275
01:38:51,977 --> 01:38:54,313
No, don't get... I was...

1276
01:38:54,522 --> 01:38:56,440
What I meant,
I just wanted you should...

1277
01:38:56,649 --> 01:38:58,442
- I was fooling.
- So you're going to need

1278
01:38:58,651 --> 01:38:59,985
- a new secretary?
- Well...

1279
01:39:00,194 --> 01:39:02,321
- Really, Mr Belt.
- Well, no, I was only...

1280
01:39:02,530 --> 01:39:05,324
And I suppose that's because
I'll be too busy with your children,

1281
01:39:05,533 --> 01:39:07,868
- is that it?
- No, I ain't got none. I mean...

1282
01:39:08,077 --> 01:39:10,037
But if you'd like to gather
a few together, it...

1283
01:39:10,246 --> 01:39:12,331
You wanna put a few together
and we'll be a good...

1284
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:15,042
- No.
- I'd love to, Stanley.

1285
01:39:15,251 --> 01:39:17,711
- And I love you.
- Well, that's OK.

1286
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:19,255
I mean, you're right.

1287
01:39:19,463 --> 01:39:22,508
That is, you win.
Because I love you too.

1288
01:39:22,716 --> 01:39:24,593
But I should be the aggressor,
you shouldn't

1289
01:39:24,802 --> 01:39:27,096
be chasing, because...

1290
01:39:27,304 --> 01:39:28,764
Stanley!

1291
01:39:32,893 --> 01:39:36,605
Stanley. Stanley.

1292
01:39:36,814 --> 01:39:39,775
Aren't you overacting a little bit,
Miss Balman? Balin.

1293
01:39:39,983 --> 01:39:41,777
It's a movie, see. I'm fine.

1294
01:39:41,985 --> 01:39:44,029
The people in the theatre
know I ain't gonna die.

1295
01:39:44,238 --> 01:39:46,490
Here, it's a movie stage.
Here, look at this, see?

1296
01:39:46,698 --> 01:39:48,033
There's wires and lights.

1297
01:39:48,242 --> 01:39:50,077
And I'm gonna make more movies,
so I couldn't die.

1298
01:39:50,285 --> 01:39:52,454
It's like a make-believe...
It's a dumb city.

1299
01:39:52,663 --> 01:39:55,874
Mr Lewis, you are a complete nut.

1300
01:39:56,083 --> 01:39:58,377
Which reminds me, I'm having nuts
and whipped cream for lunch.

1301
01:39:58,585 --> 01:40:00,379
Would you join me, please?
Crew, that's lunch.

1302
01:40:00,587 --> 01:40:03,215
One hour for the actors
and seven days for the technicians.

1303
01:40:03,423 --> 01:40:07,427
It's a movie set breaking,
once and for all, to go to have lunch.
