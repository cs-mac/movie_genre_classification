1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:12,003
Based on the true story of
Scandinavia's first witch hunts.

2
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,888
DEVIL'S BRIDE

3
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,210
I hope our small island won't be -

4
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,090
too uncomfortable after Stockholm.

5
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,485
We have a lot to do.

6
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,164
I prepared these -

7
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,006
to brief you, Circuit Judge -

8
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,765
on our ways of doing things.
- Keep them.

9
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,888
I did not come here
to copy the past-

10
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,689
but to bring about changes.

11
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,603
Changes, Your Honour?

12
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,843
I fear our little Åland
has turned into -

13
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,604
a seething nest of witchcraft.

14
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,124
Rakel!

15
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,481
My water has broken.

16
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,487
<i>Tear open the breach</i>

17
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,767
<i>Let the jawbones stretch</i>

18
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,970
<i>Open up the doors
to the granary of flesh</i>

19
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,321
Old seer. Tell me
who stole my rye sheaves.

20
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,164
What is it?

21
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,083
Someone stole Ebba's rye sheaves.

22
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,650
Lisbet?

23
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,722
Johan? Anders?

24
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,206
Ingborg? Kirstin?

25
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,361
Rebecca? Mats?

26
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,611
It is a pity-

27
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,163
that I studied in Uppsala -

28
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,322
not in Tartu.

29
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,403
We might have met earlier.

30
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,050
MALLEUS MALEFICARUM

31
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,686
Your Honour.
- Has she no shame?

32
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,048
I am a poor wife,
I need my stolen sheaves.

33
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,690
Ulrica, you may go.

34
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,810
I'll look into it at
the winter assizes.

35
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,006
Winter?

36
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,243
I can't keep us alive
with my granary of flesh.

37
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,085
My family'll starve to death!
- Any witnesses to the crime?

38
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,324
No. So I asked the beggar woman
Karin to divine the thief.

39
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,971
To divine the thief? -Yes.

40
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,488
But she saw no one.

41
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,849
I even asked the Bailiff along
to be a witness.

42
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,084
I will talk to him.

43
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,567
He's a good man -

44
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,688
not a village pussy ward.

45
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,161
Seriously looking for
a bride of his own.

46
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,129
Your Honour.

47
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,211
What is this divining?

48
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,489
Just an old tradition,
a harmless custom.

49
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,404
Someone divines
a thief or a murderer.

50
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,370
She can be right,
or she can be wrong.

51
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,329
Without judicial evidence -

52
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,482
anyone can be deemed guilty.

53
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,848
That's why we need laws
and proper trials.

54
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,163
No more heathen practices
and random accusations.

55
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,847
This island will now
enter modern times.

56
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,840
What's the new judge like?

57
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,285
Haven't seen him.

58
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,046
Perhaps I'll ask him
if I can be his maid, too.

59
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,600
We could share the maid's bed.

60
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,842
Guess what.

61
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,290
In my dream, I saw a man -

62
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,931
glistening in the sun.
- A beautiful dream.

63
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,766
He came towards me.
Then right up to me.

64
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,084
And his stem...
- You mustn't...

65
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,845
...pressed against me.
- You mustn't...

66
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,366
Don't you ever feel the urge?

67
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,566
The Reverend preaches that
innocent lambs will drown...

68
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,564
If they won't live piously
and in the fear of the Lord.

69
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,130
But Lovisa, it was no ordinary dream.

70
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,682
It was a sign, a premonition.

71
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,080
Sheep cannot swim.

72
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,401
Anna, they will all drown!

73
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,809
Valborg, please.

74
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,087
This one time only.

75
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,527
I will meet a man.

76
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,171
He's gorgeous. like a mountain.

77
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,130
Like a rock he rises in front of me
when 1 least expect it.

78
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,806
What do I need to do?
- It's not that clear.

79
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,291
It is one thing to know -

80
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,125
quite another to let people
use the knowledge.

81
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,567
Teach me. Tell me what I need.

82
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,324
Find a lovage root.
- Lovage.

83
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,165
Put the dried root in his pocket.

84
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,006
Tie a knot with your hair,
and light as a feather -

85
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,845
touch his bare, sweaty skin with it.

86
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,367
Keep the knot with you always,
against your breast.

87
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,410
Tell me more!
- I am tired.

88
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,687
Rakel gave birth today.

89
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,402
But I was with her
this very morning.

90
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,323
A pretty little girl.

91
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,281
You could've learned a lot today.
- I know. I'm sorry.

92
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,487
So sweet.

93
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,162
Cute!

94
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,608
Valborg and I foretold
the future with tallow.

95
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,001
A golden, godlike man waits for me.

96
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,889
The image was so clear, so strong.

97
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,850
I can't hear to wait.

98
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,164
You'll get the best one
on this island.

99
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,483
You have a stain on your blouse.

100
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,044
A pretty face won't help you here.

101
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,407
Perhaps the Psilander family
needs help in the kitchen?

102
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,365
Who wouldn't want
to be the Judge's maid?

103
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,329
But I'd never have thought -

104
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,051
that the daughter of Valborg,
our all-knowing healer-

105
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,407
would leave her foster mother.

106
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,962
I've chosen my maids.

107
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,527
Who is this sweet girl...

108
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,364
Do you feel ill, Madam?

109
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,169
Lovisa! Pepper!

110
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,811
Feel any better, Madam?

111
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,567
And who is this -

112
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,768
sweet girl?

113
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,127
I am Anna Eriksdaughter.

114
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,726
I came to ask if you need
any help in the kitchen.

115
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,643
I told her we don't need any.

116
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,486
But Anna knew that pepper
can be used <i>as</i> medicine.

117
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,087
I know the herbal lore.
- Anna must go now.

118
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,611
I take her as my chamber maid.

119
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,163
Anna, don't!

120
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,642
Just a taste.

121
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,608
The boats are coming!

122
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,284
The men return!

123
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,080
Come! Let's go!

124
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,323
Let's go!

125
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,527
Begging your pardon.

126
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,764
Madam Elizabeth's maid.
- Anna Eriksdaughter, Your Honour.

127
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,684
It is he.

128
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,171
The man of my dreams I saw -

129
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,811
in the candle's shadow.
- Anna, no.

130
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,407
He rises like a mountain
when 1 least expect it.

131
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,926
Neither earth nor water
can hold him back.

132
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,325
He's Elias, you fool.

133
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,885
Lovisa!

134
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,845
Here is the neighbor
of your cousin Sven:

135
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,730
Mårten Sjöberg from Saltvik.

136
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,966
His wife passed away last winter.

137
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,646
But now Mårten's here to visit us.

138
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,368
My, how you have grown!

139
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,408
Have you lost your mind?

140
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,562
Anna, for heaven's sake.

141
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,281
It is written in the stars.
Valborg saw it, too.

142
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,091
Elias is Rakel's husband!

143
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,851
Have I told you smell like -

144
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,082
a young birch in spring?

145
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,322
Will you also say so
when the winter comes?

146
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,130
Will you be my bride?

147
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,408
Oh, Karl!

148
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,290
Nothing could make me happier.

149
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,928
I must go home.

150
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,327
I'll see you home.

151
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,765
No, not before I've told Father.

152
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,761
Dear child, we must talk.

153
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,210
Perhaps you should confess.

154
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,168
What are you doing?

155
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,282
What are you doing?

156
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,280
No! Stop!

157
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,408
Don't you want to receive
the love of our Lord?

158
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,320
Let us go.

159
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,407
Gertrud, pull yourself together.

160
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,961
Leaving already?

161
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,168
Valborg's little Anna.

162
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,447
Not so little any more.

163
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,126
I'm sixteen already.

164
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,807
I guess you fail to notice
time pass at sea.

165
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,522
I was going to thank you.

166
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,683
I hear you saved
our sheep from drowning.

167
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,689
I ran into the water...
- Into the water?

168
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,843
A true mermaid.

169
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,845
I think I ran on the waves.

170
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,925
It happened so fast
I didn't have time to drown.

171
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,282
Let's go for a swim.

172
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,810
I'm so afraid I will...
- Get pregnant.

173
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,930
Who was it?

174
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,687
You'd never believe me.

175
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,408
No one would.

176
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,003
Did he talk about God's grace?

177
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,251
How can you know?
- You're not the first one.

178
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,881
I've helped other fearful girls.

179
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,130
Good evening.

180
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,606
The light of the body is the eye:

181
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,447
if thine eye be single, thy
whole body shall be full of light.

182
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,320
But if your vision is poor-

183
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,570
your whole body
will be full of darkness.

184
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,322
Parishioners.

185
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,006
No one can serve two masters -

186
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,722
without a deceitful darkness
creeping into our souls.

187
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,529
In this village -

188
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,211
the forces of darkness...
- Mother?

189
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,931
...threaten to murder the light.

190
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,410
Mother!

191
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,244
Mother!

192
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,604
Someone has put the evil eye
on the old lady.

193
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,887
But they just got here!

194
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,081
<i>Spat out a spark</i>

195
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,960
<i>Through Earth, through the ground</i>

196
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,567
<i>Through the Virgin's maidenhead</i>

197
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,410
In the name of the Father-

198
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,007
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

199
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,246
How can it be so difficult
to find a doctor?

200
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,325
He is mostly in Stockholm.
with luck, on a nearby island.

201
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,210
It'll take days to get a doctor here.

202
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,644
How is my mother?
- That woman...

203
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,281
She spits, spins bread,
does strange tricks.

204
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,967
Last time, Madam's maid did the same.

205
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,722
She is asleep.

206
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,929
Where have you received
your schooling?

207
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,131
I am the village midwife and healer.

208
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,842
My lore is handed down
from one generation to another.

209
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,400
Who asked you here?

210
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,530
How is Madam?

211
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,841
I shouldn't have let that woman in -

212
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,241
but they just barged in.
- Who?

213
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,484
Valborg. -Valborg's powers
don't bode well for our village.

214
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,847
Fragile green sprigs of spring.

215
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,365
What would God think-

216
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,364
if those powers of nature
were destroyed?

217
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,841
We mustn't harm God's creation.

218
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,400
What right do you have then -

219
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,960
to destroy the innocent ones
God has created?

220
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,442
I will find witnesses if you
don't change your ways.

221
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,965
Valborg is lying.

222
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,281
These are not lies!
- It's not the first time!

223
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,283
I'm sure we can agree that -

224
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,931
our little Gertrud was the last one.

225
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,806
I thought she would die.

226
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,967
For Madam.

227
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,486
To wish her health.

228
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,409
Please. Take it.
- Thank you.

229
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,691
Anna.

230
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,081
For Madam Elizabeth.

231
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,002
He dropped something.

232
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,482
You dropped this.

233
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,564
My knife.

234
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,602
How careless of me.

235
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,490
Thank you, beautiful saviour.

236
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,166
You're finally awake.

237
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,410
When the Batholomew Fair is over-

238
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,441
come to the cave.

239
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,285
I'll wait for you there.

240
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,247
<i>...mouth of a wicked lad</i>

241
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,325
<i>Turning right cheap
like the broom of a fast lass</i>

242
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,325
<i>Dear girl, dear girl,
dear girl, listen here</i>

243
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,041
<i>Don't you forbid me
from hugging you again</i>

244
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,091
<i>one pond '5 deeper and the other...</i>

245
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,042
Do you feel ill?

246
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,609
I am fine.

247
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,370
For your good health.

248
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,728
Your mother's good health, Nils.

249
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,084
I hear Valborg visited your mother.

250
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,806
What sort of a healer is she?
- Just an ordinary midwife.

251
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,366
She uses herbs
for women's troubles.

252
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,091
There are no ordinary healers.

253
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,481
People believe in
harmless little tricks.

254
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,449
Have done so for centuries.

255
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,605
Butchering innocent souls
in their mother's womb.

256
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,044
Is that harmless?
- They're playing God.

257
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,851
There are no harmless tricks.

258
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,369
Witchcraft is always witchcraft.

259
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,002
Did you find out what
that woman, Karin, does?

260
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,287
She is just -

261
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,522
a poor old beggar woman.

262
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,763
Who uses devil's tricks
to divine thieves.

263
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,730
Understandably so.

264
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,646
These villagers live on
this godforsaken island.

265
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,964
Some of them starve to death.

266
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,249
The law forbids such witchery.

267
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,962
Are these women ignorant of it -

268
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,520
or don't they just not care?

269
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,521
Beggars divine thieves.

270
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,002
Healthy people fall suddenly
seriously ill.

271
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,408
What do you imply?

272
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,321
That Valborg has used -

273
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,529
evil forces?
-of course not.

274
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,203
But now that you say it...

275
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,124
Let's take Karin, for instance.

276
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,363
People claim, for good reason -

277
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,206
that she uses the evil eye.

278
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,251
And Valborg, the angel maker-

279
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,005
defies our God!

280
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,405
I must convene the assizes
because of these women.

281
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,160
Thank you for an excellent meal.

282
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,489
I found a plant in the garden...

283
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,643
I wanted to compare
it to the book's...

284
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,409
“Lovage, Levisticurn officinale,
is a perennial plant -

285
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,723
flowering from July to August
with pale yellow blooms.

286
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,681
The stem is smooth, hollow,
leafless and bluish -

287
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,321
with two or three...“
- I see Anna can read.

288
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,521
My stepmother taught me.

289
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,688
Anna seems to be eager
to learn things.

290
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,606
You haven't told anyone, have you?

291
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,728
Who hit you?

292
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,206
Karl?

293
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,362
Karl's not like that.

294
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,482
Now that we're engaged -

295
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,846
he came to my bedchamber.

296
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,124
He noticed it wasn't my first time.

297
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,849
That someone had already...

298
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,320
Karl left me.

299
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,321
My father wanted to know why.

300
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,882
He hit me, called me a whore
and abandoned me.

301
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,047
My father said
I've ruined his life.

302
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,130
You can always stay here with me.

303
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,804
Where did you get this?

304
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,008
Silk is dreadfully expensive.

305
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,287
In Stockholm.

306
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,691
Let's go to Stockholm together.
- You're sweet.

307
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,931
Only the best for my bride.

308
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,322
You're shirtless!

309
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,888
If I tell you something -

310
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,850
promise that you never, ever -

311
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,241
reveal it to a living soul?

312
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,849
I promise...

313
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,442
Elias is Rakel's husband!

314
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,444
Anna, it's a mortal sin!

315
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,688
What was it like?

316
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,404
Be careful!

317
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,769
Silly girl.

318
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,167
Get away, we must...
- We must dance!

319
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,847
<i>Once did a pretty girl kiss
the mouth of a wicked lad</i>

320
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,049
<i>Turning right cheap
like the broom of a fast lass</i>

321
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:06,364
<i>I'm not a great seer,
nor a great witch</i>

322
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,082
<i>when I see a pretty buy
his heart I will win!</i>

323
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,450
I came to take Valborg
to be interrogated.

324
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,889
She made a fire of nine
different types of wood -

325
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,443
and shoe soles, tinder,
liquor and garlic.

326
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,842
She read a rhyme for each cow.

327
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,721
<i>You will follow me like the devil
follows his false master...</i>

328
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,246
You remember the rhyme well,
thank you.

329
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,210
What do you know of
the visit the accused made -

330
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,762
to Madam Elizabeth Psilander
after she suffered a fit?

331
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:51,165
She did trick with a loaf,
and spells. -What kind?

332
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,242
<i>In the name of the Father,
of the Son and...</i>

333
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,322
That is from the Bible.

334
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,929
And Ulrica Johansdaughter
ought to know it.

335
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,005
And the accused?

336
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,446
I just lit a bonfire for the cows.

337
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:13,606
An old practice many villagers use.
It harms no one.

338
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,287
Madam Elizabeth Psilander
was seriously ill.

339
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,603
I did my best to keep her alive.

340
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,450
Your Honour.

341
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,285
There isn't a single family
in the village -

342
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,806
whose child Valborg hasn't
helped into this world.

343
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,168
This trial is about witchcraft,
not midwifery.

344
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,206
Valborg has used white magic.

345
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,367
I want to remind Your Honour-

346
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,081
that only black magic
is called witchcraft.

347
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,846
In King Christopher's Law...
- The Bailiff should know -

348
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,403
that the law is no more
recognized in our realm.

349
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,644
All magic is dangerous,
therefore punishable.

350
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,488
Jurors, please rise
to hear the verdict.

351
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,930
Widow Valborg Magnusdaughter
has been proven guilty -

352
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,686
of practising witchcraft to
damage people and cattle -

353
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,082
for the benefit of herself
and the devil.

354
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,883
Therefore, she will banished
from here for the rest of her life.

355
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,051
Leave Rakel's husband alone.

356
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,161
I love him.

357
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,844
You follow your lust.

358
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,888
It's not the same as love.

359
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,963
I hope nothing happened
on the laundry day -

360
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,725
that cannot be salvaged.

361
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,281
Valborg.

362
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,451
Where is she? My Valborg.

363
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,690
You made a terrible mistake.

364
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,084
Overturn the sentence.
You can do it.

365
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,889
I observed the law.

366
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:08,124
And the trial was properly held,
you must understand it.

367
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,969
You scoundrel!

368
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,283
You know how long it takes
to clean those boots?

369
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,650
This'll make them shine.

370
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,202
Well, always time for one game.

371
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,928
Shall we?

372
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,443
How do you use your skills?

373
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,961
Ebba asked me
to divine the thief and...

374
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,008
Speak Swedish!

375
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,126
Cripes! Never have I spoken before -

376
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:30,000
in front of such big, fine lords!

377
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,242
What should I invent?

378
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,722
Sometimes I see small black kittens.

379
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:40,931
Once I saw a big black dog,
tall as an urchin.

380
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,482
But the trip I did only once.

381
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,688
What trip?

382
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,125
The first time -

383
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,966
I was there all alone,
and the black man...

384
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,487
He was big in every way!

385
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,641
Where was this?

386
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,404
Oh! It felt good!

387
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,246
But the second time
there was food.

388
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:08,689
Got to eat my fill!
Meat and fish!

389
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,685
Then he carried me home
on his strong arms!

390
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,649
Where did you find all that food?

391
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,688
On the Blockula Mountain, of course.

392
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,886
The same old story.

393
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,724
Because she's been there,
on the Mountain!

394
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,290
Believe it if you will.

395
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,603
Don't believe me?
I'll show you.

396
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:33,565
The black man hit me,
tore at me, mauled me...

397
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,007
Enough!

398
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,690
The jurors will decide on the case.

399
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,727
Can I go now?

400
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,131
Whore!

401
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,571
Imbalance of bodily fluids.

402
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:21,010
It has caused melancholy.

403
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:28,644
Blood-letting prevents her
from sinking in deeper.

404
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,887
And ipecac helps vomiting.

405
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,688
A person often angry
and melancholic -

406
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,604
must take this regularly.

407
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,646
We will follow your instructions.

408
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,850
This really is not for Madam.

409
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,845
Everything will turn out right.

410
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,966
And you know what?

411
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,568
Karin told her old story about
the Mountain at the trial.

412
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,491
No...

413
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,363
Did you say no?

414
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,441
Yes...

415
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,410
You speak!

416
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,326
I must talk to you.

417
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,090
We have two small children now,
they need their father.

418
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:35,521
I ask you as a woman.
End your affair with Elias.

419
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,525
I'm not thinking of myself only.

420
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,408
I am sorry.

421
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,771
But the bond between Elias and me -

422
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,606
is so strong. Stronger than life.

423
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,287
This is not the first time.

424
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,045
That's not true.

425
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,681
He's easily attracted to young,
beautiful girls.

426
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,321
I am your friend.

427
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,609
You hate Elias.

428
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,048
You try to turn me against him
and lie about him.

429
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,851
I must serve Madam Elizabeth's tea.

430
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,561
If Valborg were here,
I'd talk to her.

431
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,927
How dare you to mention my Valborg!

432
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,130
You're just a selfish little girl.
- But not a bitter old hag.

433
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,962
I used to like you.

434
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,811
But look at yourself now!

435
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,088
My darling.

436
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,490
Anna darling. Give it to me.

437
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,766
Don't come any closer.

438
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,524
You'll never touch me again.

439
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,443
Give it to me.

440
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,448
Damn you!

441
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,487
You're bleeding!

442
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,082
It's just a scratch.

443
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,926
Promise you'll never leave me!

444
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,602
To tell the truth.

445
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,043
Karin knows what it means.

446
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:23,206
Who did you meet at the Mountain?

447
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,087
No one.

448
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,328
No one.

449
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:39,444
Let me remind you of hell.
Liars will burn in eternal flames.

450
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,609
In never-ending pain.

451
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,004
Telling the truth -

452
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,562
and the names of
all the other witches -

453
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,086
will cleanse your soul.

454
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:11,922
You cannot receive Holy Communion -

455
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,322
unless you confess all your sins.

456
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,282
We'll travel to Stockholm -

457
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,442
Elias and me.

458
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,565
Forget Elias.

459
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:40,161
I ought to congratulate you
on your engagement.

460
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,727
Did you try to protest to your
parents?

461
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,168
So you gave in blindly.

462
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,961
Why wouldn't I?

463
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,246
Mårten is a good man.

464
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,847
A decent merchant.

465
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,606
He's kind-

466
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,480
doesn't drink too much or
hit children without a reason.

467
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,926
I wonder how Rakel
keeps him to herself.

468
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,206
She binds Elias to herself so -

469
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,886
that he cannot even breathe.

470
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,684
Anna.

471
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:36,842
No one else knows about
you and Elias yet -

472
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,685
but you maybe discovered
at any time.

473
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,162
Imagine what will happen then!

474
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:47,165
Should I sell myself to
some old widower, too?

475
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,248
Anna.

476
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,969
I thought we were best friends.

477
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,485
Have you witnessed something
with your own eyes?

478
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:02,683
Rakel Larsdaughter has used herbs
to cast spells.

479
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,411
And she has managed to dye
woollen yard red.

480
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:09,565
How do you think that happened?
- Through black magic.

481
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,766
Karin Persdaughter -

482
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,242
a beggar woman without an abode
or work in this district -

483
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:32,086
has been proven to have
made a pact with the devil-

484
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:36,529
to gain profit by black magic and
to help the forces of darkness -

485
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:41,041
she has followed in her sinfulness.
- Good riddance to her.

486
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,647
Therefore she will be,
according to our laws -

487
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:49,967
sentenced to death by beheading
and burnt at the stake.

488
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,610
A death sentence!

489
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:59,766
“The voice of my beloved!
Behold, he cometh leaping -

490
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:03,561
upon the mountains,
skipping upon the hills.'

491
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,004
Rakel! Come and see how a head drops!

492
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,321
I think it's horrible and disgusting.

493
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,085
They say he's uglier
than the devil.

494
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,925
The executioner,
all the way from Turku!

495
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,802
Strong evidence shows -

496
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:26,568
that these evil deeds do not
spring from a mystic -

497
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,486
but from a natural
source: witchcraft.

498
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,131
Let us also be aware that -

499
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,125
even in our midst
there may be souls -

500
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,329
who have made a pact
with the devil.

501
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,087
In the name of the Father-

502
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,731
of the Son -

503
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,804
and of the Holy Ghost.

504
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,002
Communion! I want the Communion!

505
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,448
I want to cleanse my soul,
I don't want to go to hell!

506
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,887
I've seen you!

507
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:11,521
I've seen you hags
on the Blockula Mountain!

508
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,888
And the good Reverend knows
everyone's name!

509
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,770
As Karin has now made
an official confession -

510
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:21,925
she is ready to receive
the Lord's blessing.

511
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,801
The body of Christ.

512
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:32,368
The blood of Christ.

513
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,881
No!

514
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,530
No, no!

515
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:51,049
I don't want to die!

516
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,490
I'm an old wife and -

517
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,086
I don't think my fleshy cunt
will save me now.

518
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,286
Anders!

519
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:47,443
<i>Grandma Ebba is alleged to
have used rnagia divinaria</i> -

520
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:52,765
<i>to solve crimes, therefore being
guilty of a pact with the devil.</i>

521
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,841
<i>According to the testimony
of Persdaughter</i> -

522
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:00,970
<i>widow Lisbeta Skarp has turned
herself into an animal -</i>

523
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,522
<i>with black fur
to take part in the devil's feast.</i>

524
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,886
Mother!

525
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,530
Let me go!

526
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,843
Let go, you scoundrels!
Don't touch me!

527
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:42,880
Can all those guilty of witchcraft
be sentenced to death?

528
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:06,889
Rakel Larsdaughter is arrested
for practising witchcraft.

529
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,611
Rakel, come with us.

530
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,686
What about my children?

531
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,240
They're better off
with the neighbours -

532
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:27,369
than in a stinking dungeon.

533
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,843
Mother!

534
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,608
Mother!

535
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,288
Mother!

536
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,522
Johan, will you hold
your little sister-

537
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,843
while I warm up some
sugar water for her?

538
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,927
Darling!

539
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,526
Forgive me. I didn't know
what I was doing.

540
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,490
I didn't mean that Rakel...
- What are you saying?

541
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:45,643
It was wrong to give
Rakel's name to the Judge.

542
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:49,088
I thought they'd just banish
her like Valborg.

543
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,967
God damned bitch.

544
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,842
Elias.

545
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,010
I should've never trusted you.

546
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,722
I don't want to hear.

547
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:15,205
How did you get the Judge
to believe your lies?

548
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:34,681
I know how.

549
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:00,723
We have been forced to witness
individual tragedies.

550
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,609
But only a hardened soul-

551
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:08,241
does not confess its sins.

552
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:16,370
In the name of God, these souls
will burn eternally in hell.

553
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,006
I may not be -

554
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:25,210
as certain of what
I said about Rakel when...

555
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:29,285
when you denounced her.
- Yes.

556
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,771
I see.

557
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,930
Usually you are quite
certain about everything.

558
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,970
It was a mistake. I thought...

559
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,441
You can rest easy.

560
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:47,210
You can confidently leave
the matter to us jurists.

561
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,802
We have the methods and the tools -

562
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:55,043
to drag out the truth.

563
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,404
Ebba!

564
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,843
Lisbeta!

565
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,410
Gertrud!

566
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,447
Gertrud?

567
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,286
Reverend!

568
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,811
Everyone knows it!

569
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,362
Help me, please!

570
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,847
Tell them I'm innocent.

571
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,691
Karl!

572
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:01,205
My Karl.

573
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,601
You said once -

574
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:21,121
that I made all your
dreams come true.

575
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,169
Karl.

576
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,647
You slut.

577
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,371
I picked you -

578
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:38,810
from all the innocent virgins.

579
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:03,406
Witches' ointment.

580
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:08,450
It's just ordinary shoe...

581
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:23,729
Did you fly to the Mountain?

582
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,602
On a goat, or a cow?

583
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,801
Lisbeta's family-

584
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,282
may soon lose their home.

585
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:52,885
Your Excellency...

586
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,521
I am sure you understand-

587
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,171
that we need firewood.
- Firewood?

588
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:05,131
We need your cottage -

589
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:09,205
for firewood when we burn
witches at the stake.

590
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,601
<i>Stigma diaboli.</i>

591
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:32,325
Look for scars, deformities
and dark patches on skin.

592
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,321
No pain.

593
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:55,720
Have you not done
the needle test before, Bailiff?

594
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:59,600
If the suspect doesn't feel anything,
she's been marked by the devil.

595
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:02,251
Case closed.

596
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,607
I fell from a tree as a child.

597
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,051
Ebba Matsenkia.

598
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:11,327
Lisbeta Skarp.

599
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,880
Gertrud Bengtsdaughter.

600
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,202
Maria Nilsdaughter.

601
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,931
And Ingeborg Olofsdaughter.

602
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,528
According to the law, all will be
sentenced to death by beheading -

603
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,729
then burnt at the stake.

604
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,244
Anders...

605
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,847
Mother's little darlings.

606
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:40,569
It was no witches' ointment.
I wanted my shoes to shine!

607
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:44,328
Karl, help me!

608
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,845
Karl!

609
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:51,010
Rakel Larsdaughter.

610
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:54,880
Rakel Larsdaughter has not yet
completed her confession.

611
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,328
Interrogations will continue.

612
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:13,363
In the name of the Father-

613
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,727
of the Son -

614
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,610
and of the Holy Ghost.

615
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:52,600
Help me!

616
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,967
Help me!

617
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:52,684
Will you...
- I won't tell anyone.

618
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:55,288
Forgive me.

619
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,882
I said some bad things.
I was desperate.

620
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,290
You're my best and dearest friend.

621
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,881
And you mine.

622
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,170
Hi.

623
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:33,050
I brought you fresh bread.

624
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,602
I need to see Rakel Larsdotter.

625
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,250
Visits are forbidden.

626
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,402
Judge Psilander's order.

627
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:01,443
A nursling needs her mother.

628
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,001
You know?

629
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,368
Just this once.

630
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,688
Just this once.

631
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,571
Greetings from Johan.

632
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,371
Everything's fine at home.

633
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:45,407
Rakel, I am sorry. I was mad.

634
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:48,768
My little child.

635
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:53,846
My little unbaptized daughter
whose soul will be damned.

636
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:05,570
You couldn't even wait
for me to be churched.

637
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:09,361
I'll end up in hell.

638
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,128
What will be her name?

639
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:26,007
Iliana.

640
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,491
My little Iliana.

641
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,204
She will be baptized.

642
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:41,443
I promise you.
- Slut!

643
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,681
Go away.

644
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,762
Go.

645
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:18,847
Want your boots cleaned,
Mr District Judge?

646
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,526
And then some shoe polish.

647
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,170
Does anyone use -

648
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:52,131
these jars for any other purpose?

649
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,043
No.

650
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:25,525
You did that well, Madam.

651
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,968
Where's the ointment
you showed to the jurors?

652
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,520
I burnt it after the interrogations.

653
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,763
You burnt it?
- Witches' ointment.

654
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,286
I certainly didn't want to keep it.

655
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:46,731
Where did you find that?
From Rakel?

656
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,883
It is shoe polish, just like
Gertrud said in the court.

657
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:52,008
That slut is capable of
saying anything.

658
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,321
This time she told the truth.

659
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:57,242
Then the wisest thing -

660
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,846
is to leave this between us two.

661
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,241
This is a terrible mistake.

662
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:12,090
<i>Canon Episcopi?</i>

663
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,801
Is this about witchcraft?

664
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:41,684
That everything is just dreams?

665
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:48,083
Does your son know about this?
- Yes.

666
01:21:49,080 --> 01:22:01,573
We have argued about it many times.

667
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,925
<i>I have made a big mistake.</i>

668
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,727
<i>It is impossible to rectify.</i>

669
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,963
<i>I must ask for your permission
to leave this island.</i>

670
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:24,242
A big mistake.

671
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:17,162
What're you up to'!

672
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:21,050
I'm doing a good deed
to an innocent soul.

673
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:24,010
Rakel's little girl has
not been baptized.

674
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,247
It must be done.

675
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,802
In the name of the Father...

676
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,771
The Father, and the Son and...

677
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,447
The Father...

678
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,201
Forgive me.

679
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,567
Forgive me.

680
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,806
I christen you -

681
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,565
Iliana. -Anna.

682
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,968
Anna Iliana.

683
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:03,605
I christen you Anna Iliana.

684
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,851
In the name of the Father,
of the Son -

685
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:16,241
and of the Holy Ghost.

686
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:46,242
Imagine if they're
all just daydreams.

687
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:51,000
What do you say?

688
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,487
“Who is so stupid and foolish
as to think-

689
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:57,884
that all these things done in
the spirit are done in the body?

690
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:01,282
Whoever believes in such things
loses the Faith and is not of God -

691
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:05,684
but of him in whom he believes,
that is the devil.“ <i>Canon Episcopi</i>.

692
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:10,243
Written by an ignorant and aberrant
monk hundreds of years ago!

693
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,002
Rakel Larsdaughter has confessed -

694
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:17,084
and has been proven to be guilty
of the use of black magic -

695
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,401
for her own and the devil's benefit.

696
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:21,881
Therefore she will,
according to the Mosaic Law...

697
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:24,531
I want to confess.

698
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:40,684
I denounced Rakel Larsdaughter
on false grounds.

699
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:53,764
Do you confess this in all honesty?

700
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,684
Yes. I do.

701
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:08,568
Then the court must find out-

702
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:11,769
if the devil has led
this person to do so.

703
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,684
Anna Eriksdaughter
will be arrested -

704
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:17,604
for interrogation and investigation.

705
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:19,641
I will handle this myself.

706
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,810
Certainly.

707
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:43,326
Anna, you can still
change your confession -

708
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:46,290
concerning Rakel Larsdaughter.

709
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,488
Get up.

710
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:03,569
This is an official interrogation.
Get up!

711
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:08,886
You will now tell me -

712
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:11,281
all your secrets.

713
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:16,167
What's it like to
fly on those beasts?

714
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:18,242
Do you turn into an animal, too?

715
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,926
What does it feel like
to meet the devil?

716
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,607
When he lays with you?
You feel lust? Tell me!

717
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:26,489
Tell me!

718
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:29,245
I don't know you any more.

719
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:41,968
I am the District Judge,
a man of the law.

720
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:45,726
In front of God, our king
has assigned me the duty -

721
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:50,169
to uncover all devil's deeds
until my dying day.

722
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:03,246
Future generations will read
about it in the chronicles.

723
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,206
Chronicles never lie.

724
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,522
FLORA OF SWEDEN

725
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:03,604
Several witnesses have told -

726
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:08,004
that the accused has used the lore
received from her foster mother-

727
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:11,641
the witch Valborg,
banished from this island.

728
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:16,726
Anna has used black magic
in unnatural way -

729
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,646
to heal sicknesses and bring
good luck with cattle.

730
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:25,282
The accused has also been close
to the beggar woman Karin -

731
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:28,364
already proven to be a witch.

732
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:33,765
Finally, she has boasted
of being able to walk on water.

733
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:38,050
What does the accused
Anna Eriksdaughter have to say?

734
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,524
Your Honour.

735
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:56,686
The devil wouldn't be the devil
if he were easy to recognize.

736
01:31:57,240 --> 01:32:02,246
The devil blinds you with
his glamour, touches you -

737
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:05,085
fills you with magnificent strength.

738
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:13,001
Makes you howl like a bitch,
until you're ready to fly.

739
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:16,327
That is what the devil can do.

740
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:19,961
Isn't it so, Honoured Judge?

741
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:29,803
I am guilty of all the things
mentioned here.

742
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:36,366
And of an even worse sin.

743
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:40,047
I have borne false witness
against an innocent woman.

744
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:44,484
Rakel is innocent.
- She has confessed her sins.

745
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,689
Then it is the devil's handiwork.

746
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:54,726
I know it, for I did
all the evil deeds -

747
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,326
in the name of
Rakel Larsdaughter.

748
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:19,802
Jurors have decided that
Anna Eriksdaughter -

749
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:24,010
is guilty of practising witchcraft
in Rakel Larsdaughter's name -

750
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:26,924
thus endangering the whole village.

751
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,243
She is sentenced to death
according to God's Law:

752
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:34,769
Exodus 22:18.
Rakel Larsdaughter will be set free.

753
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:11,562
Murderer!

754
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:39,687
I will fetch her myself.

755
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:29,804
The body of Christ.

756
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:34,408
The blood of Christ.

757
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,683
My beloved -

758
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:01,366
esteemed parishioners.

759
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:10,127
A great day for Christianity!

760
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,042
Anna!

761
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,687
Anna!

762
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:48,881
Anna Iliana!

763
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:55,205
Mother, tell me again
what happened to Big Anna.

764
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:59,171
It was our Reverend!
He raped Gertrud -

765
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:02,244
and destroyed her life!
- You murder innocent women!

766
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:05,244
And of many others, including mine!

767
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:12,089
Water has turned into wine.

768
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,200
A miracle!

769
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:16,931
You dyed the water red -

770
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:21,130
fooled the Reverend and saved Anna!

771
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:22,645
Set her free!

772
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:26,964
Set her free!

773
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:33,567
She moved to Stockholm,
become rich and famous.

774
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:38,168
Everyone admired her as
the best healer ever, right?

775
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,526
To Anna Iliana.

776
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:54,369
“Lovage.

777
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:58,365
A perennial,
flowers in July-August -

778
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:00,966
with pale yellow...'

779
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:22,808
"...shiny with two or three umbels.

780
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:26,726
The stem is long.'

781
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,689
Come.

782
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:53,326
DEDICATED TO THE EXECUTED

783
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:06,720
Nils Psilander acted
as the Åland Circuit Judge -

784
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,404
until his death in 1682.

785
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,482
There were no more executions for
witchcraft during his term in office.

786
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:12,562
In continental Sweden, witch hunts
blazed up in Dalsland in 1668 -

787
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:14,642
spreading from there to Stockholm.
By 1676, approximately 400 people -

788
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,722
were sentenced to death
for witchcraft.
