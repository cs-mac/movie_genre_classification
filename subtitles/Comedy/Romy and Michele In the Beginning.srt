1
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:26,792
Puppet, sir.
Only 10 piastres.

2
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,996
They're crap, squirrel. They fall apart
before you're out of the door.

3
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:32,665
Five then, sir.
It's handmade!

4
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:34,642
Please.

5
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,305
My sister, she's very, very sick.

6
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:41,511
I know your sister.
She's peddling in the next bar over.

7
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:44,612
- Do you know my mother?
- No.

8
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:48,319
She's very, very sick.

9
00:04:48,394 --> 00:04:50,384
I'll give you two.

10
00:04:52,598 --> 00:04:54,930
That's a bad idea, you know.

11
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:58,459
Like feeding pigeons.

12
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,141
- Do I know you?
- My name is Semelier.

13
00:05:05,213 --> 00:05:07,704
I work for a private collector
of rare antiquities.

14
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:11,013
- I cabled you last week.
- Yes.

15
00:05:11,086 --> 00:05:13,019
And I didn't answer.

16
00:05:13,088 --> 00:05:16,525
There's been a discovery
in East Africa.

17
00:05:16,592 --> 00:05:19,187
A Christian church, circa 5 A.D.

18
00:05:19,262 --> 00:05:21,890
No, it's not possible.

19
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:24,526
The Byzantine Empire
had adopted Christianity at that time...

20
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:26,969
but they never got that far south.

21
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:29,835
Nevertheless, there it sits.

22
00:05:29,907 --> 00:05:32,809
The British have financed
a dig to uncover this church.

23
00:05:32,878 --> 00:05:35,040
We believe a rare object waits inside.

24
00:05:35,114 --> 00:05:38,311
We'd like you to find it
and bring it back to us.

25
00:05:38,384 --> 00:05:40,818
So you think I'm a thief?

26
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:47,726
Now you think I'm a thief
and a whore.

27
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:50,491
No. Simply a man
who's lost faith...

28
00:05:50,564 --> 00:05:52,692
in everything except himself.

29
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:55,736
Ah.
You know nothing about me.

30
00:05:55,804 --> 00:05:58,033
You're an Oxford-educated
archaeologist...

31
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,269
an expert in religious icons.

32
00:06:00,343 --> 00:06:04,177
You were a priest before the war.
So what happened?

33
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,783
This is a leather impression of
the artifact we're looking for...

34
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:19,763
a representation
of a mythical demon.

35
00:06:36,684 --> 00:06:41,146
It's Sumerian. What makes you
think it's in a church in Africa?

36
00:06:41,222 --> 00:06:43,919
A Major Granville in Nairobi
is in charge of the dig.

37
00:06:43,993 --> 00:06:46,895
He's been persuaded to let you join it.

38
00:06:46,964 --> 00:06:49,761
You're assuming that I will say yes.

39
00:06:49,832 --> 00:06:52,393
You already have.

40
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:56,998
March! Left.
Left, right, left. Left.

41
00:06:57,075 --> 00:06:59,772
Left. Left, right, left.

42
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:03,337
Left. Left. Left, right, left.

43
00:07:03,415 --> 00:07:05,316
Left.

44
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:08,752
Left, right, left.

45
00:07:08,822 --> 00:07:11,656
Left. Left. Left, right, left.

46
00:07:21,102 --> 00:07:23,799
Mr. Merrin, sir.
The major will see you now.

47
00:07:29,112 --> 00:07:31,274
Beautiful, aren't they?

48
00:07:31,348 --> 00:07:34,249
It's a hobby from school days.

49
00:07:34,318 --> 00:07:36,650
Works wonders for the nerves.

50
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,053
You should try it sometime.

51
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:43,056
What can you tell me about the dig?

52
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:48,195
The location is a remote area
of the Turkana district...

53
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:50,132
called Derati.

54
00:07:50,202 --> 00:07:53,832
It was discovered several months ago
by a detachment of my men...

55
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,841
on maneuvers there.

56
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:59,311
When the powers that be realized
its importance, they organized a dig.

57
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,908
What have they learned so far?

58
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:08,514
That it's a church
where no church should be.

59
00:08:08,591 --> 00:08:10,991
This is Father Francis.

60
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:13,690
He'll be accompanying you to Derati.

61
00:08:13,764 --> 00:08:16,756
It's a pleasure to finally meet you,
Father Merrin.

62
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:20,065
- I've read all your work at seminary.
- It's Mr. Merrin.

63
00:08:21,706 --> 00:08:24,539
I was especially impressed
with your treatise on the Roman rituals.

64
00:08:24,608 --> 00:08:29,547
I'm no longer a part of that. I'm sure you
didn't come here to discuss Catholic rituals.

65
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:33,073
I was actually headed to Kenya
to begin missionary work...

66
00:08:33,152 --> 00:08:35,143
when Rome learned of the discovery.

67
00:08:35,221 --> 00:08:39,522
They've asked me to make sure the site's
religious aspect have the proper consideration.

68
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:41,892
Hmm.

69
00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:44,955
How come you've opened
the site to the Vatican?

70
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:46,796
We haven't...

71
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:49,065
officially.

72
00:08:49,138 --> 00:08:51,971
You're both my guests.

73
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:55,410
Tell me, have you any theories
on who might have built this church?

74
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:57,640
Well, not until I've seen it.

75
00:08:57,714 --> 00:09:00,911
Surely the Vatican has
some record of its creation.

76
00:09:00,984 --> 00:09:04,113
I'm afraid not.

77
00:09:04,187 --> 00:09:06,622
We're as in the dark
about it as you are.

78
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,770
- How long have you been with the dig, Chuma?
- Since the beginning.

79
00:09:25,846 --> 00:09:29,179
The British hired me as an interpreter.

80
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,019
What happened here?

81
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:39,528
Plague. Ravaged the valley
50 years ago.

82
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:43,361
- How many died?
- All of them.

83
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,497
I'm Lancaster Merrin.

84
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,767
Major Granville should have contacted you
about my joining the dig.

85
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,333
He did.

86
00:10:52,814 --> 00:10:55,748
Is something bothering you, mate?

87
00:10:58,086 --> 00:11:00,577
No.

88
00:11:00,655 --> 00:11:04,183
- I'd like to see the dig site as soon as possible.
- You drink, Merrin?

89
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,558
I shouldn't...

90
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:09,120
but my will is weak.

91
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:13,064
Then you might just survive this place.

92
00:11:14,605 --> 00:11:17,335
I understand you've uncovered
the church dome...

93
00:11:17,408 --> 00:11:19,774
but that progress has slowed down.

94
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,813
You could say that.
Right, Doctor?

95
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:29,110
- I'm Sarah Novak. Very nice to meet you.
- Lancaster-- Lancaster Merrin.

96
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,984
You still haven't made it
by my room, Doctor.

97
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:38,556
I've been having this, uh,
swelling in the evening.

98
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:41,659
Thought you might have
something I could put on it.

99
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:43,670
How about a muzzle?

100
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:52,006
So how are the interior
excavations coming along?

101
00:11:52,082 --> 00:11:54,549
- They're not.
- No?

102
00:11:54,617 --> 00:11:56,779
Has the structure collapsed?

103
00:11:56,854 --> 00:11:58,981
No, the church is perfect...

104
00:11:59,057 --> 00:12:01,754
but none of the men will enter,
those we have left anyway.

105
00:12:01,826 --> 00:12:04,192
Why's that?

106
00:12:05,596 --> 00:12:09,795
I shall be leaving
for the dig in five minutes.

107
00:12:14,374 --> 00:12:19,038
Well... pleasant fellow.

108
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,513
What's wrong with his face?

109
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:24,813
Other than that it's
attached to his body?

110
00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:28,185
Could be an allergic reaction
or some kind oflocalized infection.

111
00:12:28,256 --> 00:12:32,192
Do you know why the men
won't enter the church?

112
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,253
- Evil spirits.
- Oh.

113
00:12:35,331 --> 00:12:38,459
- If you believe the Turkana.
- And do you?

114
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,396
No. I'm a doctor.

115
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:45,465
But as a priest,
surely you must believe in such things.

116
00:12:45,544 --> 00:12:47,568
I'm an archaeologist.
I'm not a priest.

117
00:12:47,646 --> 00:12:49,636
Now, that's funny.

118
00:12:49,715 --> 00:12:52,548
I met Father Francis outside,
and he told me you were.

119
00:12:52,618 --> 00:12:55,986
Did he?
Well, he is mistaken.

120
00:12:57,624 --> 00:12:59,889
Father Merrin.

121
00:13:02,964 --> 00:13:05,056
This is Emekwi.

122
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:08,728
He's donating the use of a room
in his hotel for the mission school.

123
00:13:08,804 --> 00:13:11,602
Father, we are so glad
that you are here.

124
00:13:11,673 --> 00:13:15,405
These are my sons,
James and Joseph.

125
00:13:15,478 --> 00:13:18,538
- Hello,James,Joseph.
- They are learning the Bible.

126
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:21,710
- We are, uh, Christians.
- Hmm.

127
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:24,584
- Emekwi, can you see to Mr. Merrin's bags?
- Oh, of course.

128
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:27,283
James.Joseph.

129
00:13:28,593 --> 00:13:30,754
Very nice meeting you, Doctor.

130
00:14:18,784 --> 00:14:21,277
There's your goddamn church.

131
00:14:30,197 --> 00:14:32,962
Is this your first assignment, Father?

132
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:36,366
Before this, I was studying
in the archives in the Holy Sea.

133
00:14:36,437 --> 00:14:38,837
The Vatican.
Impressive.

134
00:14:38,907 --> 00:14:41,899
But not really training
for missionary work, is it?

135
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,167
This is strange.

136
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,640
It's 1,500 years old.

137
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:12,006
It should be badly weathered.

138
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:16,139
It's almost as if it were buried
right after it was built.

139
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:19,209
Chuma.

140
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:22,484
Where's Jefferies?
I need to go into the church.

141
00:15:27,763 --> 00:15:29,391
Hyenas?

142
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:31,592
They've been here
ever since we started digging.

143
00:15:31,668 --> 00:15:34,661
Even at daytime?

144
00:15:37,274 --> 00:15:40,836
No! No! No!

145
00:15:43,315 --> 00:15:45,909
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know.

146
00:15:45,985 --> 00:15:49,079
The heat?

147
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,766
Joseph?

148
00:16:10,613 --> 00:16:14,072
Are you out here by yourself?
It's dangerous.

149
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,608
- I'm collecting rocks.
- I can see that.

150
00:16:17,687 --> 00:16:20,919
I think you're about
ready for this now.

151
00:16:23,161 --> 00:16:25,823
It's a tool for professional diggers.

152
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:28,160
Wow.

153
00:16:31,203 --> 00:16:33,137
His seizure's stopped.

154
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:36,199
I wanted to keep him at the hospital
for observation...

155
00:16:36,276 --> 00:16:39,268
but the Turkana have stopped
trusting my medicine.

156
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:43,641
Well, that must make
your job very hard.

157
00:16:43,717 --> 00:16:45,708
You have no idea.

158
00:16:48,056 --> 00:16:50,183
Thank you.

159
00:16:50,258 --> 00:16:53,160
So what is it you hope to find here?

160
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:57,963
The answer to why a church was built here
a thousand years before Christianity arrived.

161
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:03,338
- You were a priest once, weren't you?
- Yes, I was.

162
00:17:03,407 --> 00:17:06,002
Black bastards!
Bloody savages!

163
00:17:07,446 --> 00:17:10,643
Can't wipe their own ass
without instruction.

164
00:17:10,716 --> 00:17:13,684
- I have to get back to town.
- Wait.

165
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:17,348
I, uh-- I found this...

166
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:19,654
and, uh, I want you to have it.

167
00:17:19,726 --> 00:17:22,718
It's a St.Joseph, for luck.

168
00:17:24,564 --> 00:17:26,965
Please, for my behavior.

169
00:17:32,074 --> 00:17:35,841
- Thank you.
- Oi, oi! What the hell are you doing?

170
00:17:35,912 --> 00:17:39,143
- Get the fuck out of here, you little scab!
- Don't!

171
00:17:39,215 --> 00:17:41,911
- Joseph, wait.
- Don't do that.

172
00:17:44,253 --> 00:17:47,383
All right, Merrin.
I didn't know you was a fuzzy lover.

173
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,619
It's okay. Come.

174
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,185
These little buggers,
they get in everywhere.

175
00:17:52,263 --> 00:17:54,197
How soon can you have the doors
to the church uncovered?

176
00:17:54,265 --> 00:17:56,028
A few days.

177
00:17:56,102 --> 00:17:59,936
- And in the meantime, how do we get in?
- We don't.

178
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:02,440
Chuma'll take you in
through the roof.

179
00:19:14,224 --> 00:19:16,216
Following us, Father?

180
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:21,263
Is it safe to walk around?

181
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:23,324
Let's see.

182
00:19:42,756 --> 00:19:46,022
Lucifer.
The Lord's favorite angel.

183
00:19:46,094 --> 00:19:49,086
Cast out after the war in heaven.

184
00:19:49,164 --> 00:19:51,565
Can't even trust angels, can you?

185
00:20:03,515 --> 00:20:06,848
- You ever seen anything like it?
- Not this far from Rome.

186
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,814
It's odd.

187
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:18,893
Churches were built to exalt heaven...

188
00:20:18,966 --> 00:20:22,800
but this, the weapons
are pointing downward.

189
00:20:26,607 --> 00:20:28,541
Look behind you, Father.

190
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:47,058
Desecration of Christ.

191
00:20:53,705 --> 00:20:56,231
Who would do something like this?

192
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,945
The crucifix
was broken off from here.

193
00:21:02,014 --> 00:21:04,484
Chuma, is there an inventory
of what's been found here?

194
00:21:04,551 --> 00:21:06,451
I wouldn't know.

195
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,115
Who would know?
'Cause this place has been vandalized.

196
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,990
Probably the lead archaeologist,
Monsieur Bession.

197
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:16,793
So where can I find him?
I need to talk to him.

198
00:21:16,865 --> 00:21:19,663
- It's not possible.
- Why not?

199
00:21:19,735 --> 00:21:21,966
He's gone mad.

200
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:31,607
No one's been inside Bession's tent
since he fell ill?

201
00:21:31,683 --> 00:21:34,652
They are superstitious.

202
00:21:37,357 --> 00:21:42,090
- And you?
- Not superstitious. Smart.

203
00:22:41,496 --> 00:22:45,263
- Chuma.
- Yes?

204
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:49,396
- Where's Bession now?
- A sanitorium in Nairobi.

205
00:22:52,843 --> 00:22:56,837
- How long has he been gone?
- A few weeks.

206
00:22:56,915 --> 00:23:00,248
- And he can read and write Aramaic?
- Sorry?

207
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:02,912
The language spoken in Palestine
at the time of Christ.

208
00:23:02,988 --> 00:23:06,287
And what does it say?

209
00:23:06,358 --> 00:23:08,294
““The fallen shall rise...

210
00:23:08,361 --> 00:23:11,091
in a river of blood.''

211
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:49,406
Do you have a moment?

212
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:52,343
Of course.
Can I get you some tea?

213
00:23:52,412 --> 00:23:55,347
Or maybe something
more substantial?

214
00:23:55,415 --> 00:23:57,645
Yes, that would be very nice.

215
00:23:59,088 --> 00:24:01,452
You dabble in the occult?

216
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,589
I found them here when I arrived.

217
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:15,103
I wanted to ask you,
did you treat Bession?

218
00:24:17,407 --> 00:24:19,933
You should let me clean that
before it gets infected.

219
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:27,713
There was nothing I could do
for Monsieur Bession.

220
00:24:27,786 --> 00:24:30,255
He had no medical symptoms...

221
00:24:30,323 --> 00:24:34,987
nothing to suggest
any kind of disease or infection.

222
00:24:35,062 --> 00:24:38,294
His breakdown was purely mental
and extremely severe.

223
00:24:38,366 --> 00:24:41,198
That's why the Turkana fear
the church is cursed.

224
00:24:41,267 --> 00:24:43,635
That and the disappearances.

225
00:24:43,704 --> 00:24:46,537
In the past few weeks,
we've lost a dozen men.

226
00:24:46,607 --> 00:24:49,042
Runaways?

227
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,079
Or is it those evil spirits?

228
00:24:51,146 --> 00:24:53,138
Yeah.

229
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:07,922
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.
- Your curiosity's perfectly natural.

230
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:11,197
My father was a strong man.

231
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,898
When the Nazis started
rounding up theJews in our town...

232
00:25:13,973 --> 00:25:17,000
he didn't hesitate.

233
00:25:17,077 --> 00:25:19,204
He hid our neighbors
in the crawl space.

234
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,372
But someone turned us in...

235
00:25:21,448 --> 00:25:24,384
and we were all sent to
the concentration camps.

236
00:25:24,453 --> 00:25:26,181
I'm sorry.

237
00:25:26,254 --> 00:25:29,985
People can't really
understand, can they?

238
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:32,687
If they weren't there...

239
00:25:32,762 --> 00:25:35,127
if they didn't see.

240
00:25:35,198 --> 00:25:37,189
No.

241
00:25:39,803 --> 00:25:42,636
And my husband turned out
to be one of those people.

242
00:25:42,706 --> 00:25:47,872
I met him after the war,
and we came to Africa together, in love.

243
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:51,939
One night I realized
I-- I had to tell him the truth...

244
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:54,509
about... the Nazis...

245
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:57,579
and what they did to me.

246
00:25:57,658 --> 00:26:01,287
After that, he never touched me again.

247
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:04,661
So...

248
00:26:04,732 --> 00:26:07,758
what turns a man of the cloth
into an archaeologist?

249
00:26:09,271 --> 00:26:12,297
I don't know.
I suppose I--

250
00:26:12,374 --> 00:26:16,709
I wanted to work with something real,
something I could touch with my hands.

251
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:19,249
Do you miss it?
Being a priest.

252
00:26:19,316 --> 00:26:21,477
No.

253
00:26:21,551 --> 00:26:24,918
There's no point in that.

254
00:26:24,988 --> 00:26:28,186
Sometimes I think
the best view of God is from hell.

255
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:38,827
I should get to bed.

256
00:26:42,275 --> 00:26:45,677
I'm going to Nairobi tomorrow
to see Bession.

257
00:26:47,514 --> 00:26:50,279
- Talk to Father Gionetti.
- Gionetti?

258
00:26:50,352 --> 00:26:52,843
He runs the sanitarium.

259
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:55,719
Well, thank you...

260
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,555
for the medical care.

261
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,299
Deliver us from evil...

262
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:09,305
for thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory forever.

263
00:27:09,373 --> 00:27:11,638
Amen.

264
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,780
You, priest.
What is your name?

265
00:28:49,856 --> 00:28:52,257
I'm Father Merrin.

266
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:11,509
God is not here today, priest.

267
00:29:36,877 --> 00:29:39,472
Want some water?

268
00:29:46,287 --> 00:29:49,188
Hey, what's wrong?

269
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,591
It's late.

270
00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:01,899
You should go back to bed.

271
00:30:10,815 --> 00:30:13,250
Give it to me! It's mine!

272
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:16,049
- Oh, is it yours?
- Give it to me!

273
00:30:16,121 --> 00:30:19,091
- Mr. Merrin gave it to me.
- Here, take it.

274
00:30:19,158 --> 00:30:20,955
- Take it!
- Oh,just give it to me, you idiot!

275
00:30:21,026 --> 00:30:24,087
Who you calling idiot?
Take it! It's right here.

276
00:30:24,163 --> 00:30:25,893
Give it to me!
It's mine.

277
00:30:25,966 --> 00:30:28,697
- Shorty. Shorty. Shorty.
- Just give it to me!

278
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:31,260
All right. Okay, okay.

279
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:34,740
Go back to bed,
and I'll give you the stupid thing.

280
00:30:46,123 --> 00:30:49,092
Joseph, look out!

281
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:51,389
Joseph, get Papa!
Get Papa!

282
00:30:51,462 --> 00:30:54,227
Joseph, help me!

283
00:30:58,536 --> 00:31:01,563
Joseph, please, get Papa quickly.

284
00:31:18,994 --> 00:31:21,189
No! Help me!

285
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:46,058
Help! Help me!

286
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:48,184
Help me!

287
00:31:58,273 --> 00:32:01,038
Help me!
Help me! Please!

288
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:16,182
- What happened?
- Hyenas. They toreJames apart.

289
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:20,254
Did you see that, Lancaster?
The hyenas ignored Joseph.

290
00:32:20,331 --> 00:32:22,027
They were focused on his brother.

291
00:32:22,101 --> 00:32:27,437
That was a lot more than focused.
They acted as if he wasn't even there.

292
00:32:47,263 --> 00:32:49,754
Can you see?
Can you hear?

293
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:01,945
Come with me.

294
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,502
Monsieur Bession?

295
00:33:54,507 --> 00:33:56,634
Mr. Bession.

296
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,871
You worked on a dig in Derati.

297
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:06,751
You drew a picture of an idol.

298
00:34:06,821 --> 00:34:09,655
Where did you see it?
Was it in the church?

299
00:34:09,725 --> 00:34:12,489
Mr. Bession.

300
00:34:12,561 --> 00:34:16,361
- Father Merrin.
- How do you know my name?

301
00:34:16,432 --> 00:34:19,459
I said how do you know my name?

302
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,611
Are you hurt?

303
00:34:31,683 --> 00:34:33,675
No.

304
00:34:40,727 --> 00:34:42,718
I'm free.

305
00:34:47,736 --> 00:34:50,364
God is not here today, priest.

306
00:35:33,521 --> 00:35:35,614
I hope he finds peace.

307
00:35:37,191 --> 00:35:39,125
I'm Father Gionetti.

308
00:35:39,194 --> 00:35:41,754
I've been waiting for you.

309
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:44,560
How did he know my name?

310
00:35:44,633 --> 00:35:47,660
Have you drifted so far from God, Merrin,
that you can't see?

311
00:35:49,038 --> 00:35:51,370
Monsieur Bession
was touched by the devil.

312
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:54,240
Demonic possession?
Forgive me, Father.

313
00:35:54,311 --> 00:35:57,246
I never said he was possessed.
Only touched.

314
00:35:57,314 --> 00:36:01,251
So, "touched."
What does that mean?

315
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:05,449
In 1647, the Ursuline Convent
in Loudon, France...

316
00:36:05,525 --> 00:36:08,322
was plagued by possession.

317
00:36:08,394 --> 00:36:10,989
Thirty-four nuns had
been touched by the devil...

318
00:36:11,064 --> 00:36:13,055
committing unspeakable acts.

319
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:16,831
Having orgies including goats
doesn't make them possessed.

320
00:36:16,904 --> 00:36:21,238
Simply horny... and inventive.

321
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:26,146
Four priests were dispatched
to exorcise the demons.

322
00:36:26,216 --> 00:36:30,015
Three of them were possessed themselves
and subsequently died.

323
00:36:30,085 --> 00:36:33,545
The last one was driven insane
by his brush...

324
00:36:33,623 --> 00:36:36,114
with evil.

325
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:40,186
That is what happened
to Monsieur Bession.

326
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:42,960
And that evil remains in Derati.

327
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:46,198
You must be careful there.

328
00:36:46,272 --> 00:36:50,264
Remember, he is the father of lies.

329
00:36:50,343 --> 00:36:53,801
He will seek to poison your mind.

330
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:56,873
You will need this against him.

331
00:36:59,086 --> 00:37:02,784
The Roman Rituals.

332
00:37:02,857 --> 00:37:06,589
If you need somebody to perform
an exorcism, I'm not your man.

333
00:37:06,662 --> 00:37:08,653
I'm not a priest anymore.

334
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:11,359
You will always be a priest,
Father Merrin.

335
00:37:12,501 --> 00:37:14,662
Only your faith can save you.

336
00:37:14,738 --> 00:37:16,898
Well, then I'm doomed.

337
00:38:15,407 --> 00:38:17,898
Joseph?

338
00:38:38,535 --> 00:38:40,527
What do you have there?

339
00:38:44,508 --> 00:38:46,943
Can I see?

340
00:39:09,469 --> 00:39:11,405
You threw it away.

341
00:39:11,472 --> 00:39:16,342
- Jefferies, what the hell are you doing in here?
- It was in the dirt outside.

342
00:39:16,412 --> 00:39:19,382
- You threw it away.
- No, I didn't.

343
00:39:19,448 --> 00:39:22,418
- The clasp must have come loose--
- Liar!

344
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:28,224
Do I repulse you that much?

345
00:39:28,292 --> 00:39:31,352
Maybe if you could cure
my fucking face...

346
00:39:31,429 --> 00:39:34,729
I might look as good to you
as that archaeologist.

347
00:39:38,972 --> 00:39:42,908
- Joseph?
- He's coming for you.

348
00:39:42,977 --> 00:39:45,501
What?

349
00:39:45,578 --> 00:39:48,377
He's coming for you.

350
00:40:00,794 --> 00:40:04,789
- What happened?
- I had a bad dream.

351
00:40:04,866 --> 00:40:06,731
Ohh.

352
00:40:06,802 --> 00:40:08,770
Don't worry.

353
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:10,897
You'll be fine.

354
00:40:29,229 --> 00:40:31,823
Where is everybody?

355
00:40:31,898 --> 00:40:35,426
Sebituana's baby is coming,
so the village has gathered in welcome.

356
00:40:35,503 --> 00:40:37,232
Oh.

357
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:08,401
Joseph. Hey.

358
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,710
Joseph.

359
00:41:30,532 --> 00:41:32,397
You're back.

360
00:41:32,469 --> 00:41:36,405
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm just a little bit tired.

361
00:41:36,473 --> 00:41:40,501
These lesions--
they're not from the shock, are they?

362
00:41:40,577 --> 00:41:43,479
No.
They're completely asymptomatic.

363
00:41:43,547 --> 00:41:45,743
Itjust doesn't make sense.

364
00:41:45,817 --> 00:41:48,581
- He should have recovered by now.
- So what is it?

365
00:41:48,653 --> 00:41:51,121
In this part of the world...

366
00:41:51,189 --> 00:41:53,750
it could be a dozen things...

367
00:41:53,826 --> 00:41:56,556
but his symptoms don't
really match any of them.

368
00:41:56,629 --> 00:41:59,155
So all I can do
is just watch and wait.

369
00:42:02,336 --> 00:42:05,795
I have to do some work up at the dig.

370
00:42:05,874 --> 00:42:09,105
- Will you be all right?
- Hmm. Yes.

371
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,974
Come sit with me, Lancaster.

372
00:42:17,153 --> 00:42:19,554
I promise I won't bite.

373
00:42:27,899 --> 00:42:30,060
What is it?

374
00:42:30,134 --> 00:42:33,468
- How was Nairobi?
- Oh, fine.

375
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:36,770
- Did you see Monsieur Bession?
- He's dead.

376
00:42:39,845 --> 00:42:42,644
- How?
- I don't know.

377
00:42:42,715 --> 00:42:45,708
Some accident.

378
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:06,109
I just don't understand everything
that's happening here.

379
00:43:06,177 --> 00:43:08,974
It seems like I can't
help anyone anymore.

380
00:43:11,015 --> 00:43:13,245
Hey.

381
00:43:15,487 --> 00:43:17,682
Easy.

382
00:44:44,189 --> 00:44:46,215
Help me hold him.

383
00:52:27,492 --> 00:52:31,484
Emekwi. I'm doing
everything I can for him.

384
00:56:25,732 --> 00:56:27,723
Joseph?

385
00:58:36,049 --> 00:58:39,019
It's this place, Lancaster.
The Turkana are right.

386
00:58:39,086 --> 00:58:41,850
- It's cursed.
- Sarah.

387
00:58:41,923 --> 00:58:43,914
You don't understand.

388
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,923
What they did to me
in the camp. They--

389
00:58:50,767 --> 00:58:52,758
There's nothing left to bleed.

390
00:58:54,504 --> 00:58:57,599
There is something here,
something evil.

391
00:58:57,675 --> 00:59:01,202
Sarah, it's so much easier
to believe in evil as an entity...

392
00:59:01,278 --> 00:59:03,212
but it's not.

393
00:59:03,281 --> 00:59:07,013
It's a purely human condition
inside all of us.

394
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:11,785
Did Bession talk about
what he found under the church?

395
00:59:13,726 --> 00:59:16,388
There's an ancient temple below,
a pagan place...

396
00:59:16,463 --> 00:59:19,762
where they used to conduct sacrifices,
human sacrifices.

397
00:59:19,833 --> 00:59:23,200
Why would they build a church
on top of something like that?

398
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:25,899
Perhaps to purify the site.

399
00:59:25,975 --> 00:59:28,272
But then why bury it?

400
01:00:01,715 --> 01:00:04,013
No!

401
01:00:14,061 --> 01:00:16,087
Merrin!

402
01:00:16,163 --> 01:00:18,688
You better come with me.

403
01:00:18,767 --> 01:00:21,259
Jefferies didn't show up
for the dig this morning.

404
01:00:21,336 --> 01:00:25,467
He wasn't in his room,
so they came to the bar and they found--

405
01:01:11,994 --> 01:01:15,260
Chief Sebituana's baby
was stillborn last night.

406
01:01:15,332 --> 01:01:17,267
He blames the whites.

407
01:01:17,334 --> 01:01:19,360
You think the Turkana tookJefferies?

408
01:01:19,436 --> 01:01:22,531
I think this place
is on the verge of an uprising.

409
01:01:22,607 --> 01:01:24,508
I've contacted Major Granville.

410
01:01:24,577 --> 01:01:27,705
A detachment will be here
by this afternoon.

411
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:29,908
You disagree?

412
01:01:31,684 --> 01:01:35,382
In my experience, bringing soldiers
into a situation is always a bad idea.

413
01:02:04,222 --> 01:02:06,213
Who buried them?

414
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:13,491
Everybody died.

415
01:02:14,567 --> 01:02:16,502
Who buried them?

416
01:02:37,761 --> 01:02:41,289
All right! Halt!

417
01:02:41,365 --> 01:02:43,298
- Major Granville.
- Hello, Peter.

418
01:02:43,368 --> 01:02:46,201
Come on! Out you get!
Move it, Wilkins!

419
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:51,402
- Any answers on Jefferies?
- I'm afraid not.

420
01:02:51,477 --> 01:02:54,935
Well, you did the right thing
calling me, Father.

421
01:02:55,014 --> 01:02:58,108
I've been in these situations before...

422
01:02:58,185 --> 01:03:00,619
and you have to stay on top of--

423
01:03:05,393 --> 01:03:07,485
on top of these people.

424
01:03:07,561 --> 01:03:11,522
I'm not sure the Turkana are responsible
for what's happening here, Major.

425
01:03:14,871 --> 01:03:17,739
Major Granville?

426
01:03:19,309 --> 01:03:22,176
This dig is too important to jeopardize...

427
01:03:22,246 --> 01:03:25,307
and until I'm satisfied
that the excavation is secure...

428
01:03:25,383 --> 01:03:27,908
the British Army will
assume complete control.

429
01:03:27,986 --> 01:03:29,714
The Turkana won't like
the show of force.

430
01:03:29,786 --> 01:03:33,189
I'm not concerned with
what the Turkana like, Mr. Merrin!

431
01:03:33,259 --> 01:03:36,716
If they start any more trouble,
they will have to answer...

432
01:03:36,796 --> 01:03:40,390
to the might
of His Majesty King George.

433
01:03:46,273 --> 01:03:48,207
You cannot be here.

434
01:03:48,276 --> 01:03:51,212
Please tell Sebituana
I'm sorry for his loss.

435
01:03:51,279 --> 01:03:54,511
You are not welcome here.

436
01:03:54,583 --> 01:03:58,611
I want to know about the plague
that destroyed this village 50 years ago.

437
01:03:58,688 --> 01:04:00,713
It was not a plague.

438
01:04:03,259 --> 01:04:05,194
So, what was it?

439
01:04:05,261 --> 01:04:07,526
The evil in your church...

440
01:04:07,598 --> 01:04:10,431
it has taken Emekwi's youngest son...

441
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:12,526
and it is getting stronger.

442
01:04:12,603 --> 01:04:15,733
You must abandon your work...

443
01:04:15,807 --> 01:04:18,606
or we'll be forced to stop you.

444
01:04:18,678 --> 01:04:21,613
So you don't want to tell me?

445
01:04:28,655 --> 01:04:32,423
He says he doesn't have to tell you
because it's happening again...

446
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:34,723
right now.

447
01:05:02,161 --> 01:05:06,120
- You don't bury your dead. You cremate them.
- Yes.

448
01:05:06,199 --> 01:05:08,690
Then who's buried in that graveyard?

449
01:05:52,286 --> 01:05:54,220
I'm sorry.

450
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:23,286
What are you--

451
01:07:03,001 --> 01:07:05,469
- I'm sorry.
- Daddy.

452
01:08:42,617 --> 01:08:46,677
I will shoot 10, priest,
and you will choose.

453
01:08:46,754 --> 01:08:49,348
I can't do that.

454
01:08:56,131 --> 01:08:59,966
No! No!

455
01:09:00,037 --> 01:09:02,164
Now you choose...

456
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,229
or I will kill them all.

457
01:09:07,545 --> 01:09:10,479
Are you praying...

458
01:09:10,547 --> 01:09:12,038
to God?

459
01:09:13,118 --> 01:09:14,882
Shoot me.

460
01:09:22,896 --> 01:09:24,887
God is not here today, priest.

461
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:05,007
Papa!

462
01:10:42,254 --> 01:10:44,187
- They're empty!
- What?

463
01:10:44,255 --> 01:10:46,747
I dug up three graves.
They were all empty. What happened here?

464
01:10:46,824 --> 01:10:49,350
- I-I don't know.
- Oh, yes, you do.

465
01:10:49,428 --> 01:10:52,364
- You've been lying to me since we got here.
- Let go of me.

466
01:10:52,432 --> 01:10:54,696
Damn it!
There are crosses on the graves!

467
01:10:54,768 --> 01:10:56,702
There are crosses on the coffins!

468
01:10:56,770 --> 01:10:59,501
The church buried them, didn't they?

469
01:10:59,573 --> 01:11:01,438
Didn't they?

470
01:11:01,509 --> 01:11:03,501
Yes.

471
01:11:03,578 --> 01:11:05,512
Why?

472
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:08,014
What were they hiding?

473
01:11:08,084 --> 01:11:10,575
That this place is damned.

474
01:11:10,652 --> 01:11:13,919
No! You asked the question!
Now you're gonna listen to the answer!

475
01:11:14,924 --> 01:11:17,826
There was a massacre here...

476
01:11:17,895 --> 01:11:20,625
1,500 years ago.

477
01:11:20,697 --> 01:11:23,689
An army from the west,
led by two priests...

478
01:11:25,103 --> 01:11:27,594
searching for the origin
of a powerful evil.

479
01:11:27,673 --> 01:11:31,108
But when they got here
that evil consumed them...

480
01:11:31,176 --> 01:11:34,442
turning the soldiers
against each other in a bloodbath.

481
01:11:34,513 --> 01:11:36,981
Only a single priest survived.

482
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:39,985
When that priest made it back
to the EmperorJustinian...

483
01:11:40,053 --> 01:11:43,489
he ordered that a church
be built over the site and then buried...

484
01:11:43,559 --> 01:11:45,492
to seal the evil inside.

485
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:48,757
All mention of it was to be stricken
from the history texts forever.

486
01:11:48,831 --> 01:11:50,765
But it wasn't?

487
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:53,529
No.

488
01:11:53,602 --> 01:11:55,867
In 1893...

489
01:11:55,939 --> 01:11:59,967
a Vatican researcher
found an ancient letter in the archives.

490
01:12:00,043 --> 01:12:02,569
Four priests came
to examine the site...

491
01:12:02,646 --> 01:12:06,082
enlisting the help of the people
of this valley in their search...

492
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:08,846
and they all disappeared.

493
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:11,184
Where did they go?

494
01:12:11,256 --> 01:12:13,248
No one knows.

495
01:12:14,693 --> 01:12:17,493
The Vatican ordered a cover-up--

496
01:12:17,564 --> 01:12:19,997
the false graveyard...

497
01:12:20,067 --> 01:12:23,127
the tale of a plague to--

498
01:12:24,204 --> 01:12:26,105
to scare people away.

499
01:12:26,173 --> 01:12:28,437
And then the British
stumbled across it.

500
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:32,173
And I was sent here
to see if the legend was real.

501
01:12:32,247 --> 01:12:34,716
What legend?

502
01:12:34,782 --> 01:12:37,616
That after the war in heaven...

503
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:40,178
this is the spot where Lucifer fell.

504
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:54,204
God brought you here, Lancaster.

505
01:12:54,272 --> 01:12:56,400
Leave me alone.

506
01:12:56,474 --> 01:12:58,410
No.

507
01:12:58,478 --> 01:13:00,412
No.

508
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,345
The devil is here...

509
01:13:02,416 --> 01:13:04,349
inside that boy.

510
01:13:04,417 --> 01:13:06,351
The Turkana know it.

511
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:10,356
They came to drive the devil from him,
and he almost killed them.

512
01:13:10,424 --> 01:13:12,689
You can't run from this.

513
01:13:12,761 --> 01:13:15,094
You must help me.

514
01:13:16,298 --> 01:13:18,733
I can't.

515
01:13:18,802 --> 01:13:21,736
But you've seen what's going on here.

516
01:13:21,804 --> 01:13:24,296
You have to believe.

517
01:13:27,812 --> 01:13:29,745
I believe in nothing.

518
01:13:34,085 --> 01:13:35,781
Found Jefferies.

519
01:13:54,776 --> 01:13:56,471
- Over there!
- As you were!

520
01:13:56,545 --> 01:13:59,572
Major Granville!
Wait!

521
01:14:33,821 --> 01:14:35,812
Get him down.

522
01:14:38,827 --> 01:14:40,818
Get him down!

523
01:14:48,671 --> 01:14:50,663
You all right, Major?

524
01:14:52,443 --> 01:14:54,877
Savages.

525
01:15:03,589 --> 01:15:06,888
Major! Major!

526
01:15:16,537 --> 01:15:19,507
- Bloody savages.
- Why are you here?

527
01:15:19,574 --> 01:15:22,440
- Granville!
- You have no business to be here!

528
01:15:23,445 --> 01:15:25,379
- You must leave.
- Granville!

529
01:15:25,447 --> 01:15:27,813
- You people have plundered our ancestors.
- Granville!

530
01:15:27,883 --> 01:15:30,316
You must return Turkana to us now.

531
01:15:30,385 --> 01:15:32,479
- Let me through!
- It is time to go.

532
01:15:32,554 --> 01:15:34,489
You have already polluted our lives.

533
01:15:34,557 --> 01:15:38,857
You came here with your evil.
We knew peace before you came.

534
01:15:38,928 --> 01:15:40,658
Granville!

535
01:15:42,299 --> 01:15:45,735
No!

536
01:15:45,802 --> 01:15:49,569
No! No!

537
01:15:51,844 --> 01:15:54,540
No!

538
01:15:54,613 --> 01:15:58,276
They think it's insideJoseph!
They believe the evil is upon us!

539
01:15:58,350 --> 01:16:00,217
Chuma!

540
01:16:00,287 --> 01:16:02,016
Merrin.

541
01:16:03,623 --> 01:16:06,421
They believe it is inside Joseph.

542
01:16:06,494 --> 01:16:08,462
They are going to kill him.

543
01:16:08,529 --> 01:16:11,192
Now, please... go!

544
01:16:15,036 --> 01:16:17,369
You animals!

545
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:47,572
- Turn this way!
- I don't like it. Come on!

546
01:16:50,411 --> 01:16:53,813
Three boxes of ammunition!

547
01:16:55,785 --> 01:16:58,810
Sir. The Turkana
are preparing to attack.

548
01:17:00,823 --> 01:17:02,655
Leave me.

549
01:17:04,194 --> 01:17:06,185
Sir?

550
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:10,157
I said, leave me.

551
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:13,828
Yes, sir.

552
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:57,624
We must leave now.

553
01:18:57,691 --> 01:18:59,627
Why?

554
01:18:59,694 --> 01:19:02,128
- Where's Sarah?
- I don't know.

555
01:19:02,197 --> 01:19:04,461
Take the boy to Nairobi.

556
01:19:04,533 --> 01:19:06,660
Father Gionetti.

557
01:19:06,735 --> 01:19:08,897
Why?

558
01:19:08,972 --> 01:19:10,962
Turkana are coming to kill him.

559
01:19:21,051 --> 01:19:23,111
It's a sandstorm.

560
01:19:29,095 --> 01:19:31,120
It won't let us leave.

561
01:19:34,568 --> 01:19:37,628
We have to hide him.

562
01:19:37,704 --> 01:19:39,695
- The church.
- No!

563
01:19:39,774 --> 01:19:41,708
The Turkana won't go in there.

564
01:19:41,775 --> 01:19:43,744
It's his only chance.

565
01:19:45,747 --> 01:19:48,376
- Aren't you coming?
- I have to find Sarah.

566
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,145
We'll meet you.

567
01:19:50,218 --> 01:19:52,187
Francis!

568
01:19:58,561 --> 01:20:00,290
Now go.

569
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:13,242
Sarah?

570
01:21:55,163 --> 01:21:57,097
The Lord is coming for you.

571
01:22:27,866 --> 01:22:29,391
Sarah?

572
01:22:29,468 --> 01:22:31,060
Sarah!

573
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:39,569
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sanctu.

574
01:22:45,988 --> 01:22:48,752
- Steady now!
- Pick it up, mate!

575
01:23:09,916 --> 01:23:11,747
Sarah?

576
01:23:26,935 --> 01:23:28,562
Sarah!

577
01:24:29,574 --> 01:24:31,566
Oh, my God.

578
01:24:33,179 --> 01:24:35,170
Bession was Sarah's husband?

579
01:24:35,246 --> 01:24:36,839
Yes.

580
01:24:36,916 --> 01:24:40,682
She went into the church
with him, didn't she?

581
01:24:46,393 --> 01:24:49,557
It's notJoseph.
It's Sarah.

582
01:24:49,630 --> 01:24:51,564
Sancti Michael Archangel--

583
01:25:32,447 --> 01:25:34,381
Ready yourselves, men!

584
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:45,651
Fire!

585
01:26:01,714 --> 01:26:03,704
Chuma!

586
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:12,794
Francis?

587
01:28:12,864 --> 01:28:14,890
Francis.

588
01:28:33,824 --> 01:28:36,621
Francis.

589
01:29:03,859 --> 01:29:07,351
O Lord, forgive my disbelief.

590
01:29:07,429 --> 01:29:09,363
I need you.

591
01:29:09,431 --> 01:29:12,993
These people need you.
This valley needs you.

592
01:29:13,068 --> 01:29:15,697
Hear my cry.

593
01:29:15,772 --> 01:29:17,934
Do not abandon me now.

594
01:29:45,707 --> 01:29:47,571
Forgive my sins.

595
01:29:51,447 --> 01:29:54,007
Joseph.

596
01:29:59,389 --> 01:30:01,823
Come sit with us, Lancaster.

597
01:30:02,992 --> 01:30:05,188
I promise I won't bite!

598
01:30:05,263 --> 01:30:08,060
Joseph, run.

599
01:30:11,402 --> 01:30:13,428
- He's mine.
- Run!

600
01:30:20,946 --> 01:30:23,973
Leave him alone.
It's me you want.

601
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:32,457
I am a fallen priest.

602
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:40,867
Lord, have mercy on us.

603
01:30:40,935 --> 01:30:43,427
Christ, have mercy on us.

604
01:30:43,506 --> 01:30:45,906
Lord, have mercy on us.

605
01:30:45,975 --> 01:30:48,409
God, Father in heaven,
have mercy on us.

606
01:30:49,979 --> 01:30:53,074
God, the Son, redeemer of the world,
have mercy on us.

607
01:30:53,150 --> 01:30:56,451
God, the Holy Spirit,
have mercy on us.

608
01:30:56,522 --> 01:30:59,388
Christ, hear us.

609
01:31:01,125 --> 01:31:03,754
Holy Mary, pray for us.

610
01:31:03,829 --> 01:31:05,820
Christ, hear us.

611
01:31:07,366 --> 01:31:10,200
- Lord, have mercy on us.
- What's the matter, Merrin?

612
01:31:10,270 --> 01:31:12,261
Don't you want to
fuck me anymore?

613
01:31:16,644 --> 01:31:19,773
All ye holy angels and archangels...

614
01:31:19,848 --> 01:31:21,679
pray for us!

615
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:25,187
All ye holy orders of blessed spirits,
pray for us!

616
01:31:25,253 --> 01:31:29,214
Why would he listen to you?

617
01:31:29,293 --> 01:31:31,123
You.

618
01:31:31,194 --> 01:31:34,357
You believe in nothing.
You're all alone.

619
01:31:34,430 --> 01:31:36,331
Without hope.

620
01:31:42,106 --> 01:31:44,768
Almighty Lord...

621
01:31:44,843 --> 01:31:46,835
and father ofJesus Christ...

622
01:31:46,912 --> 01:31:49,882
grant me, your unworthy servant,
pardon for all my sins...

623
01:31:49,950 --> 01:31:52,474
and the power to fight this cruel--

624
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:12,229
Joseph, come on.
Don't be afraid.

625
01:32:12,308 --> 01:32:14,834
No! Father!

626
01:32:15,779 --> 01:32:17,713
Joseph!

627
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:21,183
Father, help me!

628
01:32:21,253 --> 01:32:24,017
- Help me! Help me!
- Joseph!

629
01:32:24,089 --> 01:32:27,286
Father Merrin!

630
01:32:27,359 --> 01:32:30,124
Merrin!

631
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:50,073
O Lord, by your name save me.

632
01:32:51,186 --> 01:32:53,086
By your strength
defend my cause.

633
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:25,621
No!

634
01:33:59,666 --> 01:34:01,531
- Father!
- Joseph?

635
01:34:12,247 --> 01:34:15,045
Joseph!Joseph!

636
01:34:15,117 --> 01:34:17,108
Wait!

637
01:34:18,755 --> 01:34:20,724
Joseph.

638
01:34:20,790 --> 01:34:22,621
Father!

639
01:34:22,692 --> 01:34:24,684
I'm coming.

640
01:34:49,156 --> 01:34:52,251
O God, hear my prayer.

641
01:34:52,326 --> 01:34:54,556
The ruthless seek my life.

642
01:34:54,629 --> 01:34:57,929
They do not keep God before them.

643
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,367
Turn back the evil upon my foes.

644
01:35:02,137 --> 01:35:05,108
In your faithfulness destroy them.

645
01:35:32,706 --> 01:35:34,367
Where's your God now, Merrin?

646
01:35:34,441 --> 01:35:37,104
Fucking his only son
while you call out his name?

647
01:35:37,177 --> 01:35:40,078
He doesn't care about this whore.

648
01:35:40,147 --> 01:35:41,843
But you do...

649
01:35:41,916 --> 01:35:45,044
because you want to
shove your rotten cock up her juicy ass.

650
01:35:54,297 --> 01:35:56,595
You can't have her, priest.
The whore is mine.

651
01:35:56,666 --> 01:35:59,761
And I'll kill her before
I let you take her from me.

652
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:06,736
From the souls made to
the image and likeness of God...

653
01:36:06,811 --> 01:36:08,643
I cast you out!

654
01:36:10,415 --> 01:36:12,406
You're a killer, Merrin.

655
01:36:12,485 --> 01:36:15,579
You looked them in the eye,
pointed your finger, and they died.

656
01:36:15,656 --> 01:36:19,523
God is not here today, priest.

657
01:36:22,329 --> 01:36:24,127
Oh, yes, he is.

658
01:36:42,085 --> 01:36:43,950
You're going to watch him die, Merrin.

659
01:36:44,022 --> 01:36:46,855
Fail him like you failed all the others.

660
01:36:46,925 --> 01:36:50,486
God, spare this child,
for he is innocent...

661
01:36:50,562 --> 01:36:52,462
and deserves your blessing.

662
01:36:52,531 --> 01:36:55,729
God, spare this child...

663
01:36:55,801 --> 01:36:57,564
for he is innocent...

664
01:36:57,636 --> 01:36:59,901
and deserves your blessing.

665
01:36:59,973 --> 01:37:03,875
God, spare this child, for he is innocent
and deserves your blessing.

666
01:37:09,617 --> 01:37:13,145
I command you to depart!
It's the power of Christ that compels you!

667
01:37:13,222 --> 01:37:15,884
It is God himself who commands you.

668
01:37:15,958 --> 01:37:18,223
It's the majestic Christ who commands you!

669
01:37:18,293 --> 01:37:20,592
God, the Father, commands you.
God, the Son, commands you.

670
01:37:20,663 --> 01:37:22,426
God, the Holy Spirit, commands you.

671
01:37:22,498 --> 01:37:24,263
The mystery of the cross commands you!

672
01:37:24,335 --> 01:37:26,860
Unclean spirit, I cast you out!

673
01:37:40,186 --> 01:37:42,678
- Lancaster.
- Sarah.

674
01:37:42,756 --> 01:37:45,021
Sarah.

675
01:37:45,093 --> 01:37:47,459
It's over now.

676
01:37:57,473 --> 01:37:59,532
Joseph.

677
01:37:59,608 --> 01:38:02,407
Joseph.

678
01:38:15,894 --> 01:38:18,488
Merrin!

679
01:38:18,563 --> 01:38:21,226
Father!

680
01:38:28,910 --> 01:38:31,343
Don't be afraid.

681
01:38:31,412 --> 01:38:33,346
I need your help,Joseph.

682
01:38:38,721 --> 01:38:43,317
Listen, whatever you hear,
whatever you see, it's just his lies.

683
01:38:43,392 --> 01:38:47,261
Don't listen. Don't watch.
You understand?

684
01:38:47,332 --> 01:38:49,799
Don't listen!

685
01:38:49,866 --> 01:38:53,928
It's just lies.
You have to be strong and concentrate.

686
01:38:54,005 --> 01:38:56,998
Can you read this?

687
01:38:57,075 --> 01:39:00,476
I will start there.
Then you will answer.

688
01:39:00,546 --> 01:39:02,674
That's me. That's you.
That's me, and that's you.

689
01:39:02,749 --> 01:39:04,613
You understand?

690
01:39:04,683 --> 01:39:06,482
Good.

691
01:39:08,688 --> 01:39:11,317
Let's start.

692
01:39:12,860 --> 01:39:14,793
O God...

693
01:39:14,862 --> 01:39:17,661
by your name save me.

694
01:39:17,733 --> 01:39:19,359
““Amen.''

695
01:39:19,434 --> 01:39:21,334
Save your servant.

696
01:39:21,403 --> 01:39:25,397
““Who places his trust in thee, my God.''

697
01:39:25,475 --> 01:39:28,410
Be unto her, O Lord, a fortified tower.

698
01:39:28,478 --> 01:39:30,208
““In the face of the enemy.''

699
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:33,010
O Lord, hear my prayer.

700
01:39:33,083 --> 01:39:35,847
““And let my cry come unto thee.''

701
01:39:35,919 --> 01:39:39,412
- The Lord be with you.
- ““And also with you.''

702
01:39:46,632 --> 01:39:48,931
Begone, evil spirit...

703
01:39:49,001 --> 01:39:53,565
in the name of the Father
and of the Son...

704
01:39:53,641 --> 01:39:56,075
and of the Holy Ghost!

705
01:39:59,281 --> 01:40:01,715
By the sign of this holy cross...

706
01:40:03,151 --> 01:40:05,280
by our Lord Jesus Christ...

707
01:40:07,190 --> 01:40:09,681
God, the Holy Ghost, commands you!

708
01:40:13,330 --> 01:40:15,924
The blood of the martyrs commands you!

709
01:40:19,837 --> 01:40:22,203
In God's name, demon...

710
01:40:23,442 --> 01:40:26,810
I cast you out!

711
01:40:42,397 --> 01:40:44,887
Sarah?

712
01:41:07,625 --> 01:41:09,616
Sarah.

713
01:41:24,410 --> 01:41:26,402
Okay?

714
01:41:45,368 --> 01:41:47,064
Thank you.

715
01:42:03,857 --> 01:42:05,791
Look, um--

716
01:42:05,859 --> 01:42:08,225
Sarah, what is it?

717
01:42:08,295 --> 01:42:10,730
What is it, Sarah?

718
01:42:10,798 --> 01:42:12,789
What is it, Sarah?

719
01:42:14,269 --> 01:42:17,260
Lancaster!

720
01:42:17,339 --> 01:42:19,604
- No!
- Help--

721
01:42:19,675 --> 01:42:21,507
Sarah.

722
01:42:21,578 --> 01:42:23,773
- No!
- Help--

723
01:42:25,416 --> 01:42:27,407
Sarah.

724
01:43:33,393 --> 01:43:34,952
Father?

725
01:43:40,468 --> 01:43:42,493
She's with God now.

726
01:43:45,207 --> 01:43:47,641
She's with God.

727
01:45:20,016 --> 01:45:22,781
I trust your mission was successful.

728
01:45:28,693 --> 01:45:32,254
I couldn't find
what you were looking for.

729
01:45:32,330 --> 01:45:34,925
But you found something.

730
01:45:35,001 --> 01:45:37,402
Didn't you?

731
01:45:43,911 --> 01:45:45,846
Good-bye, Mr. Semelier.

732
01:45:45,914 --> 01:45:48,109
Au revoir, Mr. Merrin.

733
01:45:48,183 --> 01:45:50,481
It's Father Merrin.
