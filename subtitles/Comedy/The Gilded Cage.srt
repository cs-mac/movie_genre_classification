1
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,520
And now, the great,
the wonderful Mercedes!

2
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,000
5,500 tonight.

3
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,640
What the hell is she doing?
I'll get her.

4
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,200
Go away!

5
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,760
She goes on in a few moments.
Mercedes just began.

6
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,440
You handle it.

7
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,400
I can't take any more.
I'm ready to kill her tonight.

8
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,480
A full house tonight, Mr. Baldi.

9
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,040
How much have we got?

10
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,640
1,250 more than yesterday.

11
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,400
Shall we do something
about the prince's tab?

12
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,000
-No discounts. How big is it?
-About 625.

13
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,800
-How many are they?
-Two.

14
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,120
Don't charge for the coffee.

15
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,000
Mr. Baldi,
I couldn't do a thing.

16
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,920
-Insist!
-It's no use.

17
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,400
OK, have Mercedes
stay on longer.

18
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,720
Oh, Mr. Baldi, I'll get my bag.

19
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,640
I'm sorry to bother you,
but she refuses to get up.

20
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,240
Were you having dinner?

21
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,200
She must be onstage
in 10 minutes...

22
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,680
and she hasn't made up.

23
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,120
Go away!

24
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,520
It's me, Zaza. The doctor.

25
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,400
I'm not here.

26
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,120
Show yourself, Zaza.

27
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,320
Be a good girl and uncover
yourself so I can see you.

28
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,200
But I'm a monster.
I'm horrible, Doctor!

29
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,160
Zaza, your fans are waiting,
and my dinner is getting cold.

30
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,480
Stop acting
like such a prima donna!

31
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,000
Doctor, I'm so unhappy,
so unhappy. If you only knew!

32
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,400
You're a little depressed.
It'll pass.

33
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,920
I want to die, Doctor.
I want to die!

34
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,680
Were you having dinner?
Can it be reheated?

35
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,600
Rabbit cacciatore.

36
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,080
That reheats well.

37
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,920
Here's what you do.
Put it in a double boiler.

38
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,120
But, attention, it has to be
a double boiler.

39
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,160
I always tell my friends,
the secret is the double boiler.

40
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,480
Are you dying or cooking?

41
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,160
Look who's talking!
It's your fault I'm like this.

42
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,160
Look what I have become.
A human larva. A dried up fig!

43
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,880
A dried up fig.

44
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,280
Before meeting you,
I had a firm, soft skin.

45
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,680
Look what a horror I am now.

46
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,720
Every night the same thing.
I taped it yesterday.

47
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,800
I suffer, and he plays.

48
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,560
Shall I play it back?

49
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,680
I'll give him a shot.

50
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,680
No, Doctor! No shots!

51
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,680
Ask his understudy
to replace him.

52
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,560
I'll behave.

53
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,360
Well...

54
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,080
Then, are we going to work?

55
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,920
Any tranquilizers left?

56
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,320
There are a few left in the box.

57
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,040
I'm sure.

58
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,800
As usual,
two pills after the show.

59
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,520
-I'm leaving.
-Good-bye, Doctor.

60
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,800
The season's just begun.

61
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,000
If he gets sick,
do I close the club?

62
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,880
It's nothing serious.
He's just overtired.

63
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,720
Be kind to him,
and everything will be fine.

64
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,560
-Good night, Mr. Baldi.
-Good night, and thanks again.

65
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,920
Do you know what time it is?

66
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,040
You want to ruin the business?

67
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,480
You're doing it on purpose.

68
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,160
Why do you put makeup
on your legs?

69
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,920
Nobody sees your legs on stage.

70
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,880
Indifference is
the most awful thing, Renato.

71
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,520
I've been dieting for two months
and you haven't even noticed...

72
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,440
that I've lost weight.

73
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,440
I've ruined my health for you...

74
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,560
with those diet pills
and diuretics.

75
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,280
And nothing from you...
not a word.

76
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,080
No support.

77
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,240
You don't notice me anymore.
You don't love me anymore.

78
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,120
Just the other day...

79
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,880
I bought a delightful outfit.

80
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,200
I put it on.
Just to please you.

81
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,400
Nothing.

82
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,080
I'll wind up in a nut house
if you continue.

83
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,680
Everything's possible.

84
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,600
You don't love me anymore.

85
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,120
After so many years, you think
of me as a bowl of minestrone...

86
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,160
not as the queen of the stage.

87
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,360
You're being unfaithful.

88
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,000
Here we go again!

89
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,560
There's a man in your life.

90
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,280
There aren't any men.

91
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,160
Just 250 people waiting
for the leading lady...

92
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,160
to make up her mind.

93
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,560
They pay a lot to see you...
to applaud you...

94
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,040
to applaud
the great Zaza Napoli!

95
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,440
And what do you do
while I'm onstage?

96
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,760
Where do you go while
I'm killing myself onstage?

97
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,360
Go ahead. Hit me.

98
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,480
Hit me.

99
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,200
Well, how is it?

100
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,880
It'll be fine. Don't worry,
darling. You can't even see it.

101
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,320
Did you hurt yourself
with your fists?

102
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,520
Darling, then you still love me?

103
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,240
Of course. Hurry up.

104
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,840
What's wrong?

105
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,720
-My fan.
-Jacob will bring it to you.

106
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,520
-I can't sing without my fan!
-Jacob, get Zaza's fan!

107
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,080
My fan!

108
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,600
Good evening, sweetheart.

109
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,080
Bravo, Mercedes. You've already
sung too much. Go, go.

110
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,520
Go on. Don't just stand here.

111
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,240
Announce Albin.

112
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,040
Enough of those chocolates.
Enough!

113
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,840
Renato, I've had enough
of your beautiful lady!

114
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,440
Don't shout
when a colleague is working.

115
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,680
-I could have finished myself.
-Go to hell!

116
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,760
What am I being paid for?

117
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,240
-To sing 4 songs or 8?
-To sing 16!

118
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,400
I can't depend on Madam's moods.

119
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,480
She only cares about
being in bed with you.

120
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,000
How dare you! As of tomorrow,
you dress like a man!

121
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,840
-Not like a man! Forgive me!
-What is said is said. Henry.

122
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,200
-So where's that stupid fan?
-Coming.

123
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,360
Jacob!

124
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,840
I told you not to prance
about the house naked.

125
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,160
You don't like it? Why don't
you let me dance? Look at me.

126
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,920
What do the others have
that I don't?

127
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,360
You have something more,
even if it's of no use to you.

128
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,240
Go get dressed.
And take the evening off.

129
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,720
That way,
I won't have you underfoot.

130
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,440
I don't believe this.

131
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,760
Can I talk to you for a moment?

132
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,280
It's late, Petunia,
and I have an appointment.

133
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,320
What's the matter?

134
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,360
What's the matter?

135
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,920
-What have you done this time?
-I'm expecting a baby.

136
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,320
I'm expecting a baby.

137
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,240
You got your wife pregnant?

138
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,440
But it's the seventh one.

139
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,560
How do you expect
to have a career?

140
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,400
Look at yourself in the mirror.

141
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,920
Procreation is wearing you out.
You're looking older day by day.

142
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,200
It's true.

143
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,160
OK, I'll have
the administration...

144
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,840
compensate you
for this misfortune.

145
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,760
That's fine. Go back to work.

146
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,000
I'll be forever grateful.

147
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,880
And give up this fixation.

148
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,240
Take that off your head, or I'll
tell Albin you wear his wigs.

149
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,440
And I'll tell him you have
romantic dinners while he works.

150
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,480
Get out of here, you idiot!

151
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,280
More handsome than ever.

152
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,480
How about a drink?

153
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,920
Is Zaza onstage?

154
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,040
For two more hours.
So we won't be disturbed.

155
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,120
I gave Jacob the night off.
We're all alone.

156
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,480
You look good.

157
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,200
I'm all bloated. Work.

158
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,320
I work too much,
I get upset, and I bloat.

159
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,320
-You think I look good?
-Dazzling!

160
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,040
You're really sweet.

161
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,120
Yes, my body is
still good, actually.

162
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,400
I have something to tell you.

163
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,080
This isn't easy.

164
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,760
I'm getting married.

165
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,960
I was going to write you,
but a letter...

166
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,840
She's a great girl.
You'll see.

167
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,440
You upset?

168
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,120
On the contrary,
I should be happy.

169
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,680
I always hoped you'd
fall in love with a girl...

170
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,240
so I should be happy.

171
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,400
No, everything's fine.

172
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,840
I raise a boy
for 20 years...my son.

173
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,240
Then a girl comes
and steals him.

174
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,160
A whore.

175
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,960
A whore. Yes, a whore.

176
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,640
Listen carefully.

177
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,320
If you marry her,
never set foot in here again.

178
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,520
I won't give you another cent.
Choose.

179
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,480
Good-bye, Dad.

180
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,600
You little idiot, come here.

181
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,320
Let's have a toast
for this catastrophe.

182
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,600
Did you think I'd fall for that?

183
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,560
No, but it was worth a try.

184
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,720
Come on. Let's toast.

185
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,600
You always toast a wedding.
To the bride and groom !

186
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,360
-What's the whore's name?
-Please, Dad.

187
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,880
Sorry. What's the girl's name?

188
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,840
So, you've been seeing a boy
in Paris for a year...

189
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,320
and we only find out now.

190
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,040
Answer.

191
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,200
Answer me!

192
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,440
You're scaring her, Simon.

193
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,520
She'll never talk
if you go on that way.

194
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,760
He's a nice boy, Father.
And very serious.

195
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,120
He was the one
to mention marriage.

196
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,480
What do his parents do?

197
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,960
What do his parents do?!

198
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,360
Hold on. It's for you.

199
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,280
I spoke to him. And you?

200
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,440
I spoke to mine, too.
He's happy.

201
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,920
Whore!

202
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,560
He opened champagne
to celebrate the news.

203
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,480
I've got the glass in my hand.

204
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,480
To our love, Andrea.

205
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,080
I'll put him on.

206
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,560
No.

207
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,800
Hello?

208
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,400
To your happiness,
Andrea.

209
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,120
Shit!

210
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,400
No, not you.
I just broke the glass.

211
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,880
My best wishes
for your happiness.

212
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,840
Here.

213
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
Whore.

214
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,800
Your father's nice.

215
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,680
Listen,
I'm with my parents.

216
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,760
Can I call you
tomorrow morning?

217
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,000
No, no, don't worry.

218
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,920
I do, too.
Until tomorrow.

219
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,440
Everything went fine...
thank goodness.

220
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,440
Did you hear how clear
their voices were?

221
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
Like they were
next door.

222
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,040
It was really clear.

223
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,080
Well, l...

224
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,840
It's late.
I'm going to bed.

225
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,040
Andrea, we asked you
what the young man's parents do.

226
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,840
His parents?

227
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,280
Nothing.

228
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,600
Well, they're vacationing
on the Cote d'Azur.

229
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,280
Yes...but they're not
on vacation all the time.

230
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,840
So what does his father do?

231
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,800
His father...

232
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,400
He's in the arts,
I think.

233
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,640
Cultural affairs,
in fact.

234
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,120
He's a Cultural Attaché.

235
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,280
That's it...
at the Italian Embassy.

236
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,080
Oh, good.
He's a diplomat.

237
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,720
Diplomats. Important people!

238
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,320
Why didn't you tell us
right away?

239
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,480
Does his mother work?

240
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,880
No, his mother takes care of
the children.

241
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,240
She has lots of them.

242
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,640
Good morning.
The little one's arrived.

243
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,560
-How about a nice roast?
-Fine. I'll pick it up later.

244
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,800
I want some pasta
and some Parmesan.

245
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,160
-The boy's home?
-Yes, and I've got to hurry.

246
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,680
Good morning.
The usual?

247
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,600
Yes, a cake with
the inscription...

248
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,400
"To my Lolo, from Auntie."

249
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,960
I've got to run.
He'll be waking up any minute.

250
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,560
Shall I deliver the cake?

251
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,160
No. Jacob'll pick it up.

252
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,120
I'm taking a chocolate.

253
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,800
Jacob!

254
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,480
Who did I see?

255
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,800
Who did I see there?
Who arrived?

256
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,240
The little white man.

257
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,280
This coffee really stinks.

258
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,160
You French make shitty coffee.

259
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,520
I've been called black,
I've been called queer...

260
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,760
but French, never!

261
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,640
My darlings...
I'm here!

262
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,120
The grocery lady's here.

263
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,680
-Had a good time last night?
-He took me dancing.

264
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,880
Put everything away.
Watch the eggs.

265
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,800
And don't forget
to pick up the cake at noon.

266
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,680
Oh, God, your beard's rough.

267
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,720
Is he asleep?

268
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,240
I peeked in on him before.
He's gorgeous.

269
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,120
Why didn't you tell me
that Laurent was coming?

270
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,040
I wouldn't have made a scene.

271
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,920
The truth is
that you hide him from me.

272
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,400
You can't stand sharing him.

273
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,520
You want him all to yourself,
so you try to get rid of me.

274
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,240
Oh, I'm so hungry!

275
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,840
You look awful.
What's wrong?

276
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,520
He's getting married.

277
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,120
What?

278
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,240
My son's getting married.

279
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,560
Don't be stupid.

280
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,080
I bought sole.

281
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,840
He loves sole.
I do, too.

282
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,560
I wanted lobster,
but it was too expensive...

283
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,840
so I bought sole.

284
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,120
You know, it's funny.

285
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,120
A few days ago, I dreamed
he was getting married.

286
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,800
We were at the church
and we were both crying.

287
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,000
You weren't serious?

288
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,200
Some girl he's known
for a year.

289
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,480
They went to the same school.

290
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,000
A girl.
Oh, how horrible.

291
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,840
Poor guy.
She caught him because he's...

292
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,560
he's so young,
so inexperienced.

293
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,320
He'll ruin his life.

294
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,560
I told him.
And how I told him !

295
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,640
He won't listen.

296
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,880
He says he'll be happy.
I hope he will be.

297
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,520
There's nothing I can do.

298
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,280
You know,
it hurts at first.

299
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,840
Such an unexpected blow.

300
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,720
You feel as if
you can't breathe.

301
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,440
Maybe it's my liver.
It'll go away.

302
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,120
What a bitch, that whore!

303
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,560
I see he knows.

304
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,240
Here's the little jerk.

305
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,240
Well, how about a kiss
for your Auntie?

306
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,160
He's being taken from us,
and we won't have any others.

307
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,800
Unless there's a miracle.

308
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,680
I've thought a lot
about this marriage.

309
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,080
In the president's speech...

310
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,280
replace the word "rascal"
with "scoundrel."

311
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,720
I can see Mrs. Simoneau's face
if we marry a diplomat's son.

312
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,880
No, correction.

313
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,800
Listen carefully.
Instead of "scoundrel"...

314
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,600
put "degenerate."

315
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,800
What with your background,
Simon, this is quite a marriage.

316
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,320
You, a policeman's son.

317
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,240
Enough! Don't start
with that again, Louise!

318
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,520
I'm tired of it!

319
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,880
Policeman here,
policeman there!

320
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,800
I'm fed up with it!

321
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,800
I almost ate it!

322
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,640
No, Andrea is too young.
The subject is closed.

323
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,920
Hello?

324
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,840
Speaking.

325
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,600
Oh, my God.

326
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,160
My god.

327
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,160
What's wrong, Simon?

328
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,920
President Berthier is dead.

329
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,040
In a woman's arms.

330
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,680
A prostitute.

331
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,280
A minor, no less.

332
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,960
A minor...and black!

333
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,960
A prostitute,
a minor and colored.

334
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,480
My career is ruined.

335
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,360
Don't say that, Simon.
You're not responsible.

336
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,720
Listen to me.

337
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,080
You're not responsible for
the president's private life!

338
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,400
I'm the Secretary General
of a party called...

339
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,960
"The Union for Moral Order."

340
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,840
Our president just died
in the arms of a prostitute.

341
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,200
Great meat for the press.

342
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,000
I could use
a little piece of chocolate.

343
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,080
Oh, no! He forgot
part of the inscription!

344
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,840
Aunt is not Auntie!

345
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,040
"To my Lolo from Auntie!"

346
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,400
I ordered the usual.
"Auntie," not "Aunt."

347
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,720
What a disaster!

348
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,440
Smells good.

349
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,000
Feeling better?

350
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,160
He'll come visit.

351
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,640
He'll come with that girl.

352
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,000
By the way, we'll have
to fix up his bedroom.

353
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,600
We'll get a double bed...

354
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,000
Well, we'll have grandchildren.

355
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,280
Oh, Renato, look at me.

356
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,920
I can just see you.

357
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,920
You, a grandfather...

358
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,480
pushing the carriage...
with all your pendants.

359
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,160
-Shall I beat the eggs?
-No, please.

360
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,720
I'm the boss
in the kitchen.

361
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,000
The kitchen's your kingdom?

362
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,560
Yes. Yours is the stage,
mine is here.

363
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,360
So be it.
I leave you to your concoctions.

364
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,920
Don't stop!

365
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,640
Mr. Charrier isn't here.
No, he won't be back!

366
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,000
It's been ringing all morning.

367
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,080
And your father's vanished.

368
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,760
I have something to tell you.

369
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,720
It's about Laurent's parents.

370
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,480
Don't worry.

371
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,280
We'll discuss it
with your father.

372
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,240
That's just what I don't want.

373
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,920
You'll be surprised.

374
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,320
What are you doing there?

375
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,560
Didn't you see
those vultures out there?

376
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,480
I had to use a ladder.

377
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,400
It's dangerous.
You could've fallen.

378
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,720
I did fall!

379
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,400
The hundredth! You can imagine
what my morning's been like.

380
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,920
I warn you. I'm leaving.
The reporters keep calling.

381
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,600
They chuckle.
I can't take anymore.

382
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,400
Not only the reporters.
Everyone is laughing...sneering.

383
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,440
Even on the street.

384
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,360
And who are they laughing at?

385
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,800
Who is the laughingstock? Me!

386
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,480
Thanks to President Berthier,
the moral order's become a joke!

387
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,880
Thanks, Mr. President,
thanks a lot.

388
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,800
Dirty pig!

389
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,200
There is a solution, Simon.

390
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,480
An elegant white wedding.

391
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,080
And as soon as possible...
to regain your dignity.

392
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,640
Morality, background, tradition!

393
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,200
Your daughter marries
a diplomat's son...

394
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,520
president, whore, forgotten.

395
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,800
Marry off Andrea...

396
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,640
with the Pope's blessing
if we have to.

397
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,000
No, listen, Louise,
I'm completely ruined.

398
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,440
If you keep on like this,
I'll crack.

399
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,320
We have to marry her off...
in great splendor.

400
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,200
You'll be the symbol of order
and tradition again.

401
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,120
Where do
the young man's parents live?

402
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,600
I don't rehearse
a million times.

403
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,880
I'm a professional.

404
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,480
Hire beginners...

405
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,600
but don't let them
bother the true artists.

406
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,480
Just watch Mr. Salome Von Liebig
while I sing!

407
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,560
You're only
demanding of me...

408
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,560
making me rehearse
at all hours.

409
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,400
All made up
and in costume...

410
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,440
while the others
could be in underwear!

411
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,080
Come here. I want Mr. Baldi
to show you the movements...

412
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,360
to the Queen of Broadway.

413
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,560
You dance it like a horse.

414
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,800
Dad, I have
to talk to you!

415
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,280
Being 20 and good-looking
doesn't make you talented.

416
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,440
You understand, my dear?

417
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,320
Dad, it's important.

418
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,960
Hold on.
Albin's rehearsing.

419
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,040
Did you see
what he did?

420
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,640
No, I was talking
to Laurent.

421
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,200
He's blowing bubbles!

422
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,880
He's blowing bubbles
while I sing.

423
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,840
I can't stand bubbles
while I sing!

424
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,760
Young man, what's this about
bubbles while madam sings?

425
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,280
She's right to be angry.

426
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,800
It may be
a transvestite show,

427
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,560
but you have to use
your head.

428
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,240
Concentrate
on your character...

429
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,560
the psychological
interpretation.

430
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,320
You're a handsome foreigner
strolling down Broadway...

431
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,920
with a manly gait.

432
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,280
Suddenly, you're in front
of this beautiful woman.

433
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,280
You look at each other,
fascinated.

434
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,400
You send forth a sexual call
with the pelvis...

435
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,360
like this...

436
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,160
Not bad for a psychological
interpretation.

437
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,760
What is it?

438
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,320
I'll be right back.
Go on.

439
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,520
Can I talk to you?

440
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,640
What is it?

441
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,560
Let's go upstairs.
Andrea's parents are coming.

442
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,080
They're coming to meet you.

443
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,000
You interrupt me
for that?

444
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,760
She told them you're
a cultural attaché...

445
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,360
and Albin, a housewife.

446
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,800
Then your fiancée
is stupid.

447
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,520
Remember my first day
of school?

448
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,840
I remember perfectly.

449
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,960
You told me to tell them
you were a merchant.

450
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,560
So? The girl's father...

451
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,240
surely is more liberal
than your teachers.

452
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,880
No, Dad,
just the opposite.

453
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,800
Charrier, the Deputy...

454
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,160
Moral Order...
does that ring a bell?

455
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,080
So when asked,
"What do his parents do?"

456
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,240
Andrea answered, "Cultural
Attaché" and "Housewife."

457
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,840
So what should I do now?

458
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,280
Enroll in
the Diplomatic Corps?

459
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,200
What about Albin? Snip!
He has an operation!

460
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,160
If her father finds out
she lied, it'll be tragic.

461
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,800
Try to help us,
I beg you.

462
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,600
How?

463
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,000
First, send Albin away
for a few days.

464
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,880
Albin? You try
and send Albin away.

465
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,160
And you could get rid
of some things here.

466
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,680
For example?

467
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,960
That, for example.

468
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,160
Over here.

469
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,080
And this, for sure!

470
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,680
The discus thrower? Why?

471
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,520
And that, too.

472
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,800
Is that all?

473
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,880
I don't know, Dad.

474
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,280
I'd make everything
more simple...

475
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,000
more...stark.

476
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,280
That's what I mean.

477
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,520
In short,
nothing's right here!

478
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,560
You want the dream house
that appears in magazines.

479
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,600
We don't change anything
here. Understand?

480
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,160
And you should make
a little effort, too.

481
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,920
An effort. What for?

482
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,320
You could change
a little...

483
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,040
make yourself
less conspicuous.

484
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,480
I'm conspicuous?

485
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,120
Laurent, it was just
painted a month ago.

486
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,080
Albin and Salome are fighting
over the chewing gum.

487
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,880
Yes, I use makeup, I live
with a man, and I'm an old fag.

488
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,440
But I know who I am.

489
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,480
It's taken me 20 years, and
that Deputy won't destroy it!

490
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,920
I don't give a damn
about him !

491
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,440
Not a damn!

492
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,000
Going on a trip?

493
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,640
Saint-Tropez.

494
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,200
What are you doing?

495
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,800
I don't want
to talk to them.

496
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,240
You'll go out the door
and face them.

497
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,320
No, let go.

498
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,760
We need to give them
the news.

499
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,640
You do it.
It's your idea.

500
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,560
Have the chauffeur
come around.

501
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,560
Going somewhere?

502
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,600
Going to your
President's funeral?

503
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,040
What's the future
of the Moral Order?

504
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,000
A big smile.

505
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,400
I have only one thing
to say.

506
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,320
I'm off to organize
an event...

507
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,200
which epitomizes
the spirit of my party.

508
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,400
The little white master's
in a bad mood.

509
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,120
He said I dress
like a whore.

510
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,080
He's right.

511
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,800
Tonight you'll wear
a butler's uniform...

512
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,560
and a black tie.

513
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,800
Take this to the cellar.
And that, too.

514
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,400
And get rid of
all these knickknacks...

515
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,480
and these pillows.

516
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,080
Hide everything.

517
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,880
Especially this...
to the cellar.

518
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,960
No need to now.

519
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,120
Thanks, Dad.

520
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,200
Laurent, don't bug me.

521
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,760
I have to talk
to poor Albin now.

522
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,480
What will I tell him?

523
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,560
"Get out, you're in the way.
Get out, fag."

524
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,640
You could find
a nicer way.

525
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,000
Everything OK?

526
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,960
Just fine.

527
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,000
You shouldn't be out
in the sun.

528
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,400
A suntan is becoming.

529
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,480
I know,
but in your condition...

530
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,800
the sun isn't good.

531
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,720
Why do you say that?

532
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,640
Did you look in
the mirror today?

533
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,160
-What's the matter with me?
-You're green.

534
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,640
Suntanned.

535
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,840
Yes, suntan green.

536
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,640
I'm a little worried.

537
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,400
I think you really
need a vacation.

538
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,000
But why should I take
a vacation? I feel great.

539
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,520
OK, forget
I mentioned it.

540
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,200
Renato, are you saying this
to scare me?

541
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,440
You know something.

542
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,560
The doctor told you
something.

543
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,520
No. The doctor
didn't tell me a thing.

544
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:48,080
No, I'm the one who thinks
that since you're so nervous...

545
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,520
and rundown...

546
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,760
a few days off wouldn't
do you any harm.

547
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:07,120
Listen, Renato, when you
begin to talk like this...

548
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,600
it's because you want
to tell me something.

549
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,400
Don't try to fool me.

550
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,240
I'm not 15 anymore.
I know certain tricks.

551
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,240
And this, Renato,
isn't nice.

552
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,320
It's not worthy of you.

553
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,640
You know what day it is?

554
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,880
June the 25th.

555
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,720
As you say.

556
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,440
Our anniversary.

557
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,480
20 years
of living together.

558
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,320
20 happy years.

559
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,720
And you choose today
to lie to me...

560
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,120
in the most despicable way.

561
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,240
And to try to deceive me.

562
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,920
Do you love Laurent?

563
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,160
Why do you ask me this?

564
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,080
If you love Laurent,
you'll go.

565
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,800
The little
white master called?

566
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,400
Cut it out and get rid
of the discus thrower.

567
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,720
Hurry.
There's not much time.

568
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,600
I'm being exiled,
rejected like a leper!

569
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,200
You're ashamed of me!

570
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,760
I've watched over
that boy.

571
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,360
I've sacrificed myself
for him.

572
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,920
I've been a mother to him
for 20 years.

573
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,480
Albin, listen.

574
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,560
No!
You listen to me, Renato!

575
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,760
Either I stay here
to receive the in-laws...

576
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,720
or I'll never set foot
in here again!

577
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,720
What's the matter?

578
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,720
Laurent, I told you
to wait a while.

579
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,400
It's nothing.
I've understood.

580
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,920
I'm being excluded.

581
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,040
I'm being thrown out
of my own house.

582
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,040
It doesn't matter.
I'm leaving.

583
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,400
I'll leave you.

584
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,560
The monster.
The monster is leaving.

585
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,160
Are you happy now?

586
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,400
Come in.

587
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,320
Come back in.

588
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,960
Come cry at home.

589
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,160
Albin,
stop acting like a fool!

590
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,080
I don't want to see you anymore.
You've ruined everything.

591
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,640
OK, you win.
You can stay.

592
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,920
I can't take any more.
My heart, Renato.

593
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,080
I'm not that young.

594
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,760
All these emotions...
it's too much.

595
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,320
Feel my pulse.
Oh, God, I'm collapsing.

596
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,520
Come, we'll go
to the bar.

597
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,280
It's the end.
The end.

598
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,720
You're weak. You haven't
eaten for hours.

599
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,320
No, no,
he's just overtired.

600
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,600
Do you want
to lie down?

601
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,880
That's OK.
The tea will do.

602
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,880
And some toast.

603
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,200
Well, what are we going to do
about tonight?

604
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,200
Quite a problem.

605
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,880
Two men like us...
what can we tell them?

606
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,080
Thank you, Darling.
It feels so good.

607
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:18,200
Well, maybe I could be...
I don't know...a relative.

608
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,200
His uncle, perhaps?

609
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,840
You could say
I'm his uncle.

610
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,400
All right,
I can't be his uncle.

611
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,840
In any case, you don't resemble
your character either.

612
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,720
Didn't Laurent say you were
a cultural attaché?

613
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,840
Cultural attaché,
like hell, Darling!

614
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,760
You don't know
what culture is!

615
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,160
Here it is,
tea and toast.

616
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,160
Feeling better?

617
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,520
I don't know.

618
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,760
Just look how
the great diplomat eats!

619
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,560
You're like
a steamroller.

620
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,200
Your pinky.

621
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,760
What's it doing up there?
Just look at it.

622
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,840
It does it by itself.

623
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,880
You'll say that for
the deputy tonight, huh?

624
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,720
Well, let's try to make
a man out of this uncle.

625
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,960
You have to learn
how to hold things.

626
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Hold the toast in
a manly way, like this.

627
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,240
Spread the butter
with force.

628
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,760
Drink the tea like
a laborer drinks wine.

629
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,160
First,
sit up like a man.

630
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,920
What do you want
from me?

631
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,240
Please, don't whine
every time I correct you.

632
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,240
I'm teaching you.

633
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,720
I want you to look
like a man tonight.

634
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,600
Good, now butter
your toast.

635
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,560
Butter it like a man.

636
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,440
Don't be afraid.
That's the way!

637
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,800
You're doing it
on purpose!

638
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,160
Take another one.

639
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,400
I'll never get it.
Never.

640
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,480
Don't whine, please,
don't whine!

641
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,560
Now hold this piece
firmly in your hand.

642
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:22,200
Like a man.
With a strong hand, understand?

643
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,760
Like a real man!

644
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,880
Now something
more difficult.

645
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,840
A little jam?

646
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,960
Yes, take the spoon.

647
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,720
The teaspoon?

648
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,160
Not like that!

649
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,960
It's not a paintbrush.
It's only a spoon.

650
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,360
Hold it firmly. Boldly.
Understand?

651
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,680
You have something
against me.

652
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,720
You want to kill me,
old bitch!

653
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,080
I'll never get it.
I broke the toast again.

654
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,320
It's broken. Too bad.

655
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,400
It's situations
like this...

656
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,960
that force you
to act like a man.

657
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,920
Do you understand?

658
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,160
I understand.
You're right.

659
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,400
You have to say
to yourself...

660
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,320
"Albin, so you
made a mistake.

661
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,040
"It isn't hopeless.
You can try again."

662
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,800
Force yourself.
Take another piece.

663
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,680
You're right.
In the end, it's not serious.

664
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,960
After all,
I still have other ones.

665
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,480
Your pinky...

666
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,360
It does it by itself.

667
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,720
Blow your nose.

668
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,440
Let's go home.

669
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,200
Wait.
I need to freshen up.

670
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,040
What have I done now?

671
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,240
What kind of walk
is that?

672
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,200
What's wrong with it?

673
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,080
Walk like that tonight
and we're ruined.

674
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,200
How should I do it?

675
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,800
Come here.

676
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,760
What do you want?

677
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,680
Try to walk
like John Wayne.

678
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,440
The cowboy?

679
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,240
John Wayne gets down
from the horse.

680
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,240
He goes toward the saloon.
He opens the doors, and zap!

681
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,200
-Try it.
-I have to be John Wayne?

682
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,920
There I go.

683
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,720
That's John Wayne's daughter!

684
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,760
Look at that fag!

685
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,680
Someone just
called me a fag.

686
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,120
Did you call
my friend a fag?

687
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,920
It's going down.
You can hardly see it.

688
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,400
Relax, darling.

689
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,240
You were wonderful,
marvelous.

690
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,800
I'm proud of you.

691
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,800
That human mountain
looked ridiculous...

692
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,320
when he sat on you and banged
your head on the floor.

693
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,400
I pitied him. A silly brute
who didn't know how to hit you.

694
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,280
No, leave it.
I'll get some ice.

695
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,720
It'll do him good.

696
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,880
Be right back, darling!

697
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,480
I have bad news for you.

698
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,000
I couldn't do it.
I told him to stay tonight.

699
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,120
Why?

700
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,080
What do you mean?

701
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,960
Because he nearly
died in my arms.

702
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,040
Because he's been
my companion for years.

703
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,920
And because he has
80% interest in the club.

704
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,560
How are you going
to introduce him?

705
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,440
As your uncle.

706
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,720
Then we're ruined.

707
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,040
Calm down. How stubborn you are.
What a temper!

708
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,720
We can talk it over.

709
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:04,120
Certainly, it would be ideal
if we had a woman here.

710
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,760
Strange, huh? We actually
need a woman here.

711
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,280
Why don't you
call your mother?

712
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,520
-No, never!
-Why?

713
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,640
She abandoned me 20 years ago,
and I won't ask her for a thing!

714
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,400
You're not helping
matters much.

715
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,240
OK,
I'll take care of it.

716
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,360
I'll take care of it
myself.

717
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,800
You can't be serious.

718
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,000
Go see that witch
after what she did?

719
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,520
-Are you crazy?
-Why?

720
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,920
Mrs. Deblon, please.

721
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,840
Ask the secretary
over there.

722
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,000
Come in.

723
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,920
I'd like to see
Mrs. Deblon.

724
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,080
You have an appointment?

725
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,640
No, but tell her
it's Renato Baldi.

726
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,680
I doubt she'll see you
without an appointment.

727
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,600
She's very busy.

728
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,000
At least try.
Tell her Renato Baldi is here.

729
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,520
Wait in the hall.

730
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,160
Madam President
will see you at once.

731
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,680
I'm coming with you.

732
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,240
I won't leave you alone
with that woman.

733
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,440
I know what
she's capable of.

734
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,480
Mrs. Deblon is waiting.

735
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,000
I'm coming.

736
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,440
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

737
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,520
Renato Baldi.

738
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,480
Dear Madam President.

739
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,000
I must say this is a surprise.

740
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,240
Have a seat.

741
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,480
I never drink in the morning,
but...for the occasion...

742
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,800
What made you come see me?

743
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,560
Laurent.

744
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,320
It's not serious, is it?

745
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,240
He wants to get married.

746
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,320
Already?
How old is he?

747
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,200
You don't even remember.

748
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,520
You haven't seen that boy
for nearly 20 years.

749
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,120
Yes, I know.
Did you come to reproach me?

750
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,760
My goodness, no.

751
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,680
It's just that for the first
time, Laurent needs you.

752
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,760
I can cancel my appointments.
I'll be with you tonight.

753
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,720
-Thank you.
-It's my pleasure.

754
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,560
I haven't done much
for that kid in 20 years.

755
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,280
-At times, I feel guilty.
-What can I say?

756
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,640
I'm not very maternal.

757
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,600
I am.

758
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,920
It's true.
He's been very lucky.

759
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,440
Well, then...
what time tonight?

760
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,320
At 8:00.
We'll do our little play...

761
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,960
they'll leave,
and everything will be fine.

762
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,840
Do you remember
the revue?

763
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,360
How could I forget?

764
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,520
How handsome you were!

765
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,880
I'd never seen
such a body.

766
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,440
Now don't embarrass me.

767
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,280
Remember how afraid you were?

768
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,040
I almost had
a heart attack.

769
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:03,840
I walk in my room
and find a woman in my bed!

770
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,600
I got in by giving
the doorman a tip.

771
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,240
$10 in those days!

772
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,600
I was completely drunk.

773
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,720
And when I saw you in bed nude,
I said to myself...

774
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,240
"Let's try it."

775
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,120
You have to try everything
in life, right?

776
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,240
So much had been
said about it...

777
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,960
that I gave in.

778
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,720
How long did
the two of us last?

779
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,800
I can tell you exactly.

780
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:32,520
From 2:30 to 3:45.
Two times.

781
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,920
It's hot in here.

782
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:50,920
You haven't changed much.

783
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,360
A few more pounds...

784
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,760
but it's becoming.

785
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,080
It makes you...
more manly.

786
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,840
What's all this hair? You
didn't have any when I met you.

787
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,760
I shaved it
for the stage.

788
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:12,400
He shaved it
so I never got to enjoy it.

789
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,040
Careful, Simone.
Careful.

790
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,640
It's a crepe shirt.

791
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,520
With those nails of yours,
you'll...look...

792
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,920
you pulled a thread.

793
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,480
What does that
red light mean?

794
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,760
That Madam President is not
to be disturbed for any reason.

795
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,480
Albin!

796
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:05,960
Thank you.

797
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,840
Do you have my glasses?

798
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,920
Where are my glasses?

799
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,000
Here it is.

800
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,800
"The death of
President Berthier."

801
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,000
There's nothing at all.

802
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,880
"Exemplary career..."

803
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,000
"Heart attack..."

804
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,880
Nothing here. Excellent.

805
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,480
Nothing here.
It's better this way.

806
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,440
It helps to have friends
who are newspaper editors.

807
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,560
I knew it! I was sure!

808
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,600
Those bastards! Two columns!

809
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:07,040
"The Happy Death
of President Berthier."

810
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,680
Relax, Simon.

811
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,280
Listen to this.

812
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,920
"The last sentence
uttered by Berthier...

813
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,040
"symbol of the Moral Order,
was, 'Remember my little gift."'

814
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,440
What rats! What rats!
May they die!

815
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:23,600
Forget this whole story, Simon!
Think of the goal of this trip.

816
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,720
The antique dealer
rented it to me.

817
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,360
He wants it back tomorrow.

818
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,360
I redecorated
the entire living room.

819
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,440
I hope your guests
appreciate it.

820
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,480
What's going on?

821
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,320
Thanks, Jacob.

822
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,840
I would've liked to have known
my grandchildren.

823
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,360
Don't go away!
Don't leave us!

824
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,120
Don't cry, Jacob.

825
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,640
What is this?
"Uncle Tom's Cabin?"

826
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,080
I know.

827
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:56,200
I know what you think.
People make fun of me.

828
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,760
Not just in the club...

829
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,480
but in the street as well.
Everywhere.

830
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:07,240
I'm aware that I'm ridiculous.

831
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,760
And there's only one place
where no one is ridiculous.

832
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,840
And I'm going there.

833
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,360
Good-bye, Renato.

834
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,000
Don't leave!

835
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:23,920
I'm leaving you my stereo,
my red boots, and my wigs.

836
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,040
But where are you going?

837
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,680
To Foissy!

838
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:31,520
Foissy? There's nothing
but a cemetery in Foissy.

839
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,280
That's why
I'm taking the minimum.

840
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,480
A toothbrush to the cemetery?

841
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,320
-It's over, Jacob.
-I'm praying.

842
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:31,560
You know,
my cemetery is in Lombardy.

843
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,040
It's the prettiest in the world.

844
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:37,200
There are trees.
The sky is blue.

845
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,360
There are birds.

846
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,040
Yours is for shit.

847
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:47,720
It's true. In Foissy,
they bury the dead in shit.

848
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:54,960
Forgive me for saying this,
but you've become an old hag.

849
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,440
It's true, you're worthless,
you're ridiculous.

850
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,760
You make people laugh.

851
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:07,000
But I'm with you.
Because you make me laugh.

852
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,920
So you know
what I'm going to do?

853
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:16,320
Leave everything behind and go
with you to the shit at Foissy.

854
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,880
To laugh.

855
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:23,880
Every time you're with her,
the same thing happens.

856
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,560
In 20 years,
it's just the second time!

857
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:30,120
Imagine having another child
at your age.

858
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:34,000
You'd take care of the tiny tot
by yourself, my dear.

859
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,480
I couldn't deal
with a second motherhood.

860
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,800
What's so funny?

861
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:44,040
I'm really ready
to strangle you.

862
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,640
I'd like to talk to you.

863
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,000
I know you're having problems.

864
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:22,240
I know the press is still
interested in us, and so--

865
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,600
I wanted to tell you that...

866
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,920
the people we're going to--

867
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,040
Wait!

868
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,960
This meat is not fresh.

869
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,320
I'll exchange it right away.

870
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:45,040
No, leave it. I don't want more
of the same junk.

871
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:49,320
It's shocking that a place like
this would serve rotten meat!

872
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:52,440
I'll take it back.
What else can I do?

873
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,040
I'll tell you what I'm going
to do. Write to Michelin.

874
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:59,200
You'll have fewer stars
in the next guidebook.

875
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,360
That's it.

876
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,080
Well done, Simon.

877
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,040
Now what about all the people
we're going to see?

878
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:11,160
Nothing.
It's nothing important.

879
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:25,240
Good, Jacob...very good.
A perfect butler.

880
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,440
Haven't you forgotten
something?

881
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:41,720
I can't wear shoes. I never
wear them. They make me fall!

882
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,800
Go on. Go put your shoes on.

883
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:47,120
And use your normal voice.
It's better.

884
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,880
The little white master wanted
the voice of a real black male.

885
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,440
Perfect, Dad.

886
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:55,400
You think so?

887
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,040
This suit reminds me
of my grandfather.

888
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,600
He always dressed like this.

889
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,000
He killed himself
when he was 30.

890
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,680
Remember, Dad.

891
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,560
As few gestures as possible.

892
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,480
And don't walk around,
and don't talk too much.

893
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,960
Just what's necessary.

894
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,800
The minimum.

895
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,200
What's wrong?

896
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,320
I'm dressed appropriately,
aren't l?

897
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,000
Nothing on my fingers.

898
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,720
Nothing on my eyes or lips.

899
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:24,680
And on your feet?

900
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:29,560
I thought a little hint of color
wouldn't be out of place.

901
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,520
Yes, you're right.

902
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:40,040
Dressed like this
I am even more ridiculous.

903
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:43,080
And I know
you're thinking that, too.

904
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,680
Well...

905
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,840
I'll leave.

906
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:51,920
I'll go.

907
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,520
I wanted so much to help you,
my little one.

908
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,440
It'll pass.

909
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,640
Who is it?

910
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,720
My mother.

911
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:01,960
Mr. Baldi's not here.

912
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:02,920
Who's speaking?

913
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,120
Is it you, Laurent?

914
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:13,000
Laurent, I can imagine
what you think of me.

915
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:16,560
After your father's visit, I
asked myself a lot of questions.

916
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:21,640
You may think
it's a little late, but...

917
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,560
Listen, Laurent,
your father's right.

918
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,000
It'll be better
with a woman there.

919
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:31,600
Since I'm already on the road...

920
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:34,800
if you still want me...
I'll come.

921
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,200
Come.

922
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,800
Come?!
Have you gone crazy, Laurent?

923
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:46,440
It'll be better if she's here.

924
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,600
Do you know what he will do if
your mother sets foot in here?

925
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,000
He said he wanted to help me.
He'll be good.

926
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:56,680
Come on, relax.
Everything will be fine.

927
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:59,080
Touch this. Squeeze it hard.

928
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,600
We rented you for only one day,
but if all goes well...

929
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:21,920
I'm willing to buy you...

930
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,360
and get rid of my charm.

931
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,160
In fact, I'll do it right now.

932
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,000
You have your shoes on?
Go on.

933
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,360
I'm honored. Please, come in.

934
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:06,920
My father.

935
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:14,920
My daughter.

936
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,200
Nice to meet you.

937
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,560
My husband.

938
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:20,800
It's a great honor.

939
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,120
My mother apologizes.
She'll be late.

940
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:28,520
She had to take my brothers
and sisters to my grandparents'.

941
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:33,880
Andrea told us that you have
a large family, Mr. Baldi.

942
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:34,960
Quite large.

943
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,440
How many brothers and sisters
does Laurent have?

944
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:42,520
-Six.
-Six.

945
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,360
People don't have children
anymore:

946
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:48,880
Our movement is very worried
about this drop in births.

947
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:53,520
I congratulate you. Your family
should be held up as an example.

948
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:58,280
Have a seat, please.
One, two, three.

949
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,640
This is Charrier's chauffeur.

950
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:22,200
Just a second.
Charrier's chauffeur.

951
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,920
The Charriers are
at "La Cage aux Folles."

952
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,120
Are you sure?

953
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:31,240
I'm sure. I just left them
at the owner's place.

954
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,080
Call Moreau in Toulon fast!

955
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,960
Charrier with fags!
What a story!

956
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,560
Did you have a good trip?

957
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:45,160
Great.
Beautiful weather, good roads.

958
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:48,280
We spent the night...

959
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,280
near Lyon,
at my friend Bouchard's.

960
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:54,080
He's someone
I met in the service.

961
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:58,840
I met him again a few years
later in the hotel business.

962
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:02,320
He had inherited...

963
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,480
a large property
from his father

964
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:08,520
and turned it
into a modern hotel.

965
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,360
Comfortable. Yes, comfortable.
Very nice.

966
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,120
Quite good. Quite good.

967
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,640
It was a pleasant...stay.

968
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:28,160
I like the severity
of this room.

969
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:33,360
Well, for my father...
this house...

970
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:36,800
is a place more for work
and concentration...

971
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,720
than a vacation house.

972
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,400
A monastery.

973
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,240
I captured the atmosphere
right away.

974
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:48,760
I can always tell right away
who I'm dealing with.

975
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:56,400
I'm pleased to say...
I feel good with a man like you.

976
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:58,760
You've seduced my husband,
Mr. Baldi.

977
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:02,760
I rarely hear him give
so many compliments.

978
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,120
In fact, I must admit...

979
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,080
that though
I'm a civil servant--

980
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:16,160
Champagne, or do you prefer
something else?

981
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:20,520
No, thank you.
Just some water, please.

982
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:24,920
I never drink either, but today,
I'll make an exception.

983
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,720
Watch what you're doing, idiot!

984
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,600
Nothing serious.
Champagne brings luck.

985
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:35,840
Go on, Jacob. We'll handle it.

986
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,040
Can I help you?

987
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:46,720
Jacob's a good fellow,
but he still has a lot to learn.

988
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:50,480
Help is really a problem
these days.

989
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:54,080
If I told you how many
chauffeurs I've had this year...

990
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:58,280
You must have even more trouble
since you travel so much.

991
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,120
Here I am.

992
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,800
I'm here! Here's Mother!

993
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:17,120
Please forgive me. I'm terribly
sorry, but the traffic--

994
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:20,880
Every day it gets worse.
It's becoming impossible.

995
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:23,240
Mr. Charrier,
thrilled to meet you!

996
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,400
I've been dying to meet the
father of that naughty girl...

997
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:31,840
who's stealing my baby.

998
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,240
The naughty thing!

999
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:42,480
Dear Madam, I'm just joking.
I already like the child.

1000
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:45,040
What a sweet thing!

1001
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:48,960
How about a kiss? How about
a kiss for your second mother?

1002
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:53,040
Come here, darling.
I already love her.

1003
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:55,000
She's adorable.

1004
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,800
She's frightened, poor dear.

1005
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:00,240
Come here.
Don't be afraid.

1006
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,880
She's adorable.

1007
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:08,880
Give me a cigarette.

1008
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:11,840
Go warn your mother not to come.

1009
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,160
Thanks.

1010
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,480
Excuse me for a moment.

1011
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,560
Where's the boy going?

1012
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,440
Dinner is served.

1013
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:31,400
-Jacob, what's come over you?
-Nothing. Nothing at all.

1014
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:36,640
-Servants are such a problem.
-We were just saying that.

1015
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:40,000
It's close to impossible
to get good help these days.

1016
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:45,360
You can't imagine how many maids
have passed through here.

1017
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:50,560
And one's as clumsy as the next.
Not mean, just inept.

1018
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:55,160
I could name a dozen--
Roger, Marcel, Luciano...

1019
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:58,040
Dinner.

1020
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,000
No need to be so nasty.

1021
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:05,080
Magnificent.
That Christ is splendid.

1022
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,840
-Yes. My father.
-Pardon me?

1023
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,720
My father, he restored it.

1024
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:12,560
My father loved antiques.

1025
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:16,800
Mr. Charrier on my right.
Renato on my left.

1026
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:20,960
Mrs. Charrier there,
and the girl across from mama.

1027
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,120
Please, sit down.

1028
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,560
These plates are very unusual.

1029
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:34,720
They're pictures of young men
playing together.

1030
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:38,440
We have so many plates, I can't
really say which ones those are.

1031
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,760
From the 16th century.

1032
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,200
I think they are Greek figures.

1033
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:47,040
Greeks on my plates?
How did they get there?

1034
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,640
Would you like to see it?

1035
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:52,120
I can't see without my glasses.

1036
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:55,440
They're two young men,
aren't they? Two young men.

1037
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:58,600
Young men? But there must be
some girls, too.

1038
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:01,200
Yes, I think I saw one.

1039
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:05,080
What a cute child.
She's right, of course.

1040
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:08,360
There, there's one.
There's a girl there.

1041
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,000
Isn't that a girl?

1042
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:12,680
Then I haven't seen one
in a long time.

1043
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:16,000
My goodness! It's two boys,
for sure. They're naked.

1044
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,720
Where are my glasses?

1045
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:24,200
I'll be back in a minute.

1046
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:33,960
Idiot! He uses the dishes
with the naked Greeks!

1047
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,360
I can never find my glasses.

1048
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:39,520
Let's see.

1049
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:44,840
Peasant soup Martinique style.
Jacob's specialty!

1050
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,440
Oh, I'm sorry, Madam.
Jacob, take over.

1051
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:54,480
Poor Mrs. Charrier is holding
our Lord in her arms.

1052
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:59,080
My apologies.
I am really sorry.

1053
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,880
This way, please.

1054
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,720
Bon appetit.

1055
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,440
There are only two entrances,
here and at the club.

1056
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:29,800
Morin and Chauvet,
wait at the club.

1057
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,160
Will you stay on the Coast
for long?

1058
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:51,840
No. I don't like to be away from
my constituency for too long.

1059
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,720
-From your...?
-From my work.

1060
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:58,760
And also the ambiance of
this area, the dissipation...

1061
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,360
the loose morals...

1062
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,720
make me sick.

1063
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:10,760
Doesn't that nightclub
downstairs bother you?

1064
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:14,640
A nightclub?

1065
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:17,920
Yes. And quite
an ill-reputed one.

1066
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:20,400
It's called
"La Cage aux Folles."

1067
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:23,600
Oh, yes, "La Cage aux Folles."

1068
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,680
You're right above it! You
share walls with those people!

1069
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:31,280
Just the walls.
Just the walls.

1070
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:35,120
We're not friendly with them.
That's another world.

1071
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:38,160
But...who owns the building?

1072
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,040
We do!

1073
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:45,360
You rent your cellar
to the owner of a nightclub?

1074
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,480
Yes, Yes!

1075
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:54,200
But we didn't know he was a...

1076
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:56,160
nightclub owner!

1077
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,840
Naturally...we didn't know it.

1078
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,280
He's a man...

1079
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:03,240
who doesn't say much.
He's so reserved.

1080
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,520
It's just, "Hello, good-bye."

1081
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:11,080
He's not one to say, "Hey,
I'm going...I'm going to put...

1082
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:14,920
"a nightclub in your cellar."

1083
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,120
Excuse me.

1084
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,040
We should talk
about the wedding.

1085
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:25,800
Laurent is not here, but...

1086
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,040
These are things
that parents should discuss.

1087
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:31,440
Though our kids
have already decided.

1088
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:34,920
What do you think
of the kids' decision?

1089
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:39,600
I must say that at first
I was a little against it.

1090
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:45,600
But when my daughter spoke
so highly of your family...

1091
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,880
of its respectability...

1092
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,880
When your daughter told you...
about our family?

1093
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:58,560
Yes, it...reassured me.

1094
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,680
I thought that Andrea was...

1095
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:04,600
too young to get married,
and your son, as well.

1096
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:08,560
But since they're in love...
and won't listen to reason...

1097
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:11,880
since they chose each other--

1098
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,520
Since they chose each other?

1099
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:24,000
Well, I must admit
that at first, we, too...

1100
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:29,280
were somewhat opposed to
this marriage. Especially me!

1101
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,480
It's always hard on a mother...

1102
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:35,480
when her son leaves her
for another woman.

1103
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,680
You'll say that's life.

1104
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:39,680
Sure, that's life.

1105
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:42,720
At some point, children leave.
It's a law, but...

1106
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:46,280
Excuse us. Come, honey.

1107
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:48,760
But we're discussing
important things.

1108
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,760
Excuse me.

1109
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:52,840
What's so urgent?

1110
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,160
What's the matter with you?

1111
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:59,080
Look at yourself in the mirror!

1112
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,520
All right, so it moved a little.

1113
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:05,440
-What were you thinking of?
-They believe it.

1114
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,720
All three were lovely to me.

1115
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,160
I made a big impression.

1116
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,960
Big impression? lf they
find out, everything's ruined.

1117
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,360
I'm not doing it for you,
but for Laurent.

1118
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,280
And it's working fine.

1119
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:21,400
On stage, perhaps. Makeup
and cream aren't enough here.

1120
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:24,040
The Deputy surely noticed
your hairy hands!

1121
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:29,600
A hostess doesn't leave
her guests. It isn't polite.

1122
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,120
Albin, stay here!

1123
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:37,560
My wig!

1124
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,440
Renato, give me back my wig!

1125
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,120
Give me back my wig!

1126
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:07,840
They're not expecting this.
It'll be a big surprise!

1127
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:16,560
Mr. Baldi is upstairs.

1128
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,080
I'm Laurent's mother.

1129
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:24,200
Follow me, Madam.

1130
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,320
Happy anniversary to you...

1131
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:41,320
How rude!
Leaving us alone like this!

1132
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,760
And the son disappearing
before dinner.

1133
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,760
Maybe he had an errand to run.

1134
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:50,080
And that woman is strange.
She has a way of speaking--

1135
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:52,960
When she comes out with that
"uh-uh-uh," I sense something.

1136
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,920
I think she's nice.

1137
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,480
Did someone knock?

1138
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:02,680
Well, where's that butler?

1139
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:05,920
Who's there?

1140
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:08,360
It's Laurent's mother,
Mr. Baldi.

1141
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,760
Laurent's mother?

1142
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:14,120
It's me, Renato. Open up.

1143
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,240
Her voice has changed.
Who's there?

1144
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:20,240
Laurent's mother.

1145
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:24,760
Mr. Baldi isn't here.
I haven't the key.

1146
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,960
The key's in the nook
by the door.

1147
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,200
In the nook. What nook?

1148
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:30,960
On the left!

1149
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:59,560
Mr. Charrier, I'm Simone Baldi.
Nice to meet you.

1150
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,600
You have an adorable daughter,
Madam. My compliments.

1151
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:14,440
She's gorgeous!
I knew my son had taste, but...

1152
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:29,200
Your son, Mr. Baldi...

1153
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:31,400
how many mothers has he got?

1154
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:34,680
Would you repeat
the question, please?

1155
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:40,720
I'm asking you how many mothers
your son has got.

1156
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,360
Just one. Albin.

1157
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,640
"La Cage aux Folles..."

1158
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:53,360
Dad...let me explain.

1159
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:57,000
What kind of story
did you tell me?!

1160
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:00,120
Cultural attaché?! Housewife!

1161
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,640
Stop it!

1162
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:07,280
I was afraid to tell you. I've
been afraid of you for 18 years.

1163
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:08,920
Simon!

1164
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:16,960
Let's go.

1165
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,080
Right away.
Come on. Let's get going!

1166
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:21,840
No, I'm staying.

1167
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:25,640
Then stay!
I no longer have a daughter!

1168
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,160
I no longer have a daughter.

1169
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,080
Reporters!

1170
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:38,760
Reporters.
That's the last straw.

1171
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,240
A nice white wedding, huh?

1172
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:45,480
In great splendor!
With the Pope's blessing!

1173
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:48,320
What good is that photo?
It's shit!

1174
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:51,880
What can you see?
A door with Charrier behind it?

1175
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,040
What good is that?

1176
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:19,080
I can see the headlines
in tomorrow's papers.

1177
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,960
"Sequel to President Berthier
and His Whore."

1178
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,880
"Deputy Charrier
Frolics With Transvestites."

1179
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:33,280
Mr. Deputy, take a look at
this door. There's no neon sign.

1180
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:34,440
You can leave.

1181
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:41,120
The bastards.
They've blocked the door.

1182
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:45,360
This way they are forcing you
to leave through the nightclub.

1183
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:47,560
Through the nightclub?

1184
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:49,200
They'll be waiting there.

1185
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:52,880
Through the nightclub...
with the transvestites...No.

1186
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:54,760
We'll call the police.

1187
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:03,200
A ladder. Do you have a ladder?

1188
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,680
Not again, Simon.

1189
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:10,440
I'm ruined...I'm ruined!

1190
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:16,400
Renato, the poor man
is really in a bind.

1191
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:19,320
And his wife, too.
She's in the shit with him.

1192
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:20,760
They're pitiful.

1193
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:25,280
Well, I'll have to save
the day...as usual.

1194
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,480
You want
to get out of here, right?

1195
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,640
No scandal, no publicity.

1196
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:41,120
It's the first time,
but you'll get used to it.

1197
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:45,800
Then you can do it yourself.
You're gorgeous.

1198
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:50,120
You look awful.

1199
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:52,880
White makes me look fat.
I wanted black!

1200
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:56,720
What are you saying?
He's a great girl!

1201
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:58,440
Hurry, and wiggle a little.

1202
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:28,520
Mercedes, dance with her
and move her towards the exit.

1203
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:31,920
Would you like to dance?

1204
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,600
Get going, you gutsy thing.

1205
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,960
To the hotel!
Hurry! To the hotel!

1206
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:25,080
-How much?
-How much? It's me, your boss!

1207
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,160
-Calm down, Madam.
-Madam?!

1208
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:30,600
Don't you recognize me?

1209
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:32,520
The idiot called me a whore!

1210
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:07,760
See that? She came.
I knew she would.

1211
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,680
I told you
I didn't want her here.

1212
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:13,200
She's my son's mother.
It's normal for her to be here.

1213
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:15,160
No, it's not normal!

1214
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,800
The model mother...
now, after so many years.

1215
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:23,880
Listen, if that witch goes
to the reception, I won't.

1216
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,200
-Please, Albin.
-I won't go!

1217
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:29,520
That's the only way.
That's really easy.

1218
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:32,600
-Please.
-Please like hell! I'm fed up.

1219
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:36,920
And you tell Laurent. He'll
understand because he loves me.

1220
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:41,480
He'll understand that the day
of his wedding I had to leave--
