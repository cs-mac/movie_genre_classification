1
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,626
He's over there!

2
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,339
He's this way!

3
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,417
This way! This way!

4
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,223
Hurry up!

5
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,517
Hello? It's Clark Stevens
from Farley University.

6
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,993
Hello? I'm looking
for Dr. Franks.

7
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,354
Excuse me, do you know where
I can find Dr. Franks?

8
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,904
It doesn't like it
when you say that!

9
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,573
- And it doesn't like you!
- Leave him alone.

10
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,945
Can't you tell he doesn't
like you touching him like that?

11
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,228
It doesn't like it
when you say that.

12
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:03,477
And it doesn't like you
either, Puddles!

13
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,951
It's too fucking bad!

14
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,456
That's enough, Puddles.
I'm Dr. Hendricks.

15
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:11,422
Clark Stevens.

16
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:12,625
Welcome to Cunningham Hall.

17
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,592
Thank you very much.

18
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,363
I hope you don't mind
I let myself in.

19
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:19,297
No, we've been expecting you.

20
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,600
Well, my train
ran a little late.

21
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:25,037
And it's hard to find a cab
to take you out here.

22
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:28,105
- Yet here you are.
- Yes, here I am.

23
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,443
We should probably begin with
a series of psychiatric tests...

24
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:34,747
to make sure we start with
a clean bill of mental health...

25
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:38,080
Followed by
a thorough physical.

26
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,553
- Betty.
- Mr. Franklin.

27
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:46,826
What did we talk about when we said
no more pretending we're a doctor?

28
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:49,894
- But, but I was...
- I know, Mr. Franklin.

29
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:54,634
Why don't you go back in the rec
room and make yourself at home?

30
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:58,070
Nurse Hendricks is going
to serve Pudding Pops.

31
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:00,868
- Won't that be nice?
- Very nice.

32
00:09:00,903 --> 00:09:03,632
- Good boy!
- It was nice to meet you.

33
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,013
- Hi. I'm Betty Donner.
- Clark Stevens.

34
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:09,313
I'm the Administration
Coordinator.

35
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:13,386
I'm sorry I missed you up front.
I just stepped away for a moment.

36
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:17,488
Don't worry about it.
I'm glad to finally meet you.

37
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:22,395
Same here. We are so excited about
your coming in to lend us a hand.

38
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,964
I'm excited about
getting to work.

39
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,761
Wonderful.
Wonderful.

40
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:33,005
Perfect. I'll have your badge
ready for you in a few days.

41
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,909
I need you
to fill out these forms...

42
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:38,609
so you get school credit.

43
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,636
Blue card on the bottom's
for emergency information.

44
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,516
Your keys to the kingdom.

45
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,086
- Thank you.
- And your walkie-talkie.

46
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:48,920
That's how
we communicate here.

47
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:52,857
You'll stay in a cottage on
the south side of the building.

48
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,562
Well, there's only
one thing left.

49
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:59,231
- What's that?
- To meet the big cheese.

50
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,730
Dr. Franks.

51
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:02,194
Very good.

52
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,345
Hello, Betty.

53
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,216
I take it this place has
been around for a while.

54
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:19,717
Since 1918.

55
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:24,156
You should have seen the shape it
was before we spruced it all up.

56
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:26,409
It took our patient
clean-up committee...

57
00:10:26,444 --> 00:10:28,628
a year and a half
to get it to this point.

58
00:10:28,663 --> 00:10:31,130
They've done
such a marvelous job.

59
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:33,731
Absolutely.
No, I'm sure.

60
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:38,803
It's just...
It seems a little rundown.

61
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:42,274
Not particularly conducive
to rehabilitation.

62
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:49,015
For some of the patients,
that will never happen.

63
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,548
- Get me out of here.
- Carl!

64
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,419
I shouldn't be here!
No one should.

65
00:10:53,454 --> 00:10:55,753
- Carl...
- It's okay.

66
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:59,325
They don't let you go home even
when they know you're better.

67
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,092
Why do you say that?

68
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,796
Because the people
running this place...

69
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:06,094
are really the crazy ones.

70
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:12,098
Guilty as charged.
Now run along. Go on, scoot!

71
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,809
Have a seat.

72
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:22,414
The doctor will be
with you momentarily.

73
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,153
- Good luck.
- Thank you very much, Betty.

74
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,168
"Einstein also believed...

75
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,769
some chronic
schizophrenics were...

76
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:22,706
misdiagnosed due to possible
psychokinetic conditions...

77
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:26,608
such as their ability to see
paranormal activities."

78
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:36,787
Not a pleasant way to receive
mental health treatment.

79
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,863
I received your records
from the university.

80
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:46,530
4.0 average. My, my.

81
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:51,203
You have the potential to follow
in your grandfather's footsteps.

82
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,603
Thank you.
I hope so.

83
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,276
My internship here is all
I need to get my degree.

84
00:12:57,311 --> 00:13:01,112
- Then what?
- Well...

85
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:04,316
to take residence in a mental
health facility as a counselor.

86
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:06,050
That goes without saying.

87
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:09,355
What's going on with these?
Put them in a cup, Polly.

88
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,422
Sorry, Dr. Franks.

89
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,492
My minor, sir,
is in administrations.

90
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,196
I'd love to work in a place
like Cunningham Hall.

91
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:19,997
Maybe design
an updated curriculum.

92
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:24,136
I researched the building
and its operating procedures.

93
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,569
I made notes.

94
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,174
Little changes
we might implement...

95
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:29,909
during my stay.

96
00:13:29,944 --> 00:13:31,575
Mr. Stevens...

97
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,137
I hope you understand what
you've gotten yourself into here.

98
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,916
- I'm sorry?
- This isn't a summer camp.

99
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:43,489
We have neither funding nor time for
anything but patient maintenance.

100
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:47,193
I absolutely understand that
has to be the priority, but...

101
00:13:47,228 --> 00:13:50,863
You want to empty bedpans
to make your grades better...

102
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:52,296
great.

103
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,398
But you're not in class...

104
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,802
reading about life
in a mental institute.

105
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,402
You've arrived.

106
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:01,240
I didn't mean any disrespect.
I just thought...

107
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:04,008
Let me be blunt.
You're not here to think.

108
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:08,747
If you want to be on my staff, I
want you to focus on the objective.

109
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:12,740
- That is?
- Maintenance of the mentally ill.

110
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:19,391
Make no mistake.
There are serious reasons why...

111
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:22,155
a person would be
locked up in here.

112
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:27,233
Where is this wonder boy
I have heard so much about?

113
00:14:27,268 --> 00:14:28,799
Dr. Morton, Dr. Douglas.

114
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,637
- Clark Stevens.
- Nice to meet you.

115
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:34,440
It is you.
I'd recognize you anywhere.

116
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:36,240
I met your grandfather...

117
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:40,746
at the Chicago Conference of
Mental Health Sciences in '75.

118
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:43,013
He and I
went on such a bender...

119
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:47,953
I was discussing our operating
procedures with Mr. Stevens.

120
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:50,114
We've come
to an understanding.

121
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:56,528
Introduce him to Sara, then she
can give him the grand tour.

122
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,863
I like to give my favorites
a little extra.

123
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,034
You never know when
you might need a little favor.

124
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,734
Noted.

125
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,604
So you survived
the Franks interview.

126
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,542
- Yes. Just barely.
- Some say it's the worst...

127
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,245
shock treatment
the hospital offers.

128
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,745
I can't argue with that.

129
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,652
He's kind of a shark, the
bottom line's if you work hard...

130
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:21,871
he'll hire you full-time.

131
00:15:21,906 --> 00:15:24,021
That's what he did with me.

132
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:27,293
I would just ideally love
to help change this place.

133
00:15:27,328 --> 00:15:29,284
Improve it a bit.

134
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,096
That's what we all say...

135
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,968
until the third time
you're stabbed with a pencil.

136
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:37,401
Point taken.

137
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,704
When did you
start working here?

138
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:39,737
Last year.

139
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,974
I served the same
internship you did.

140
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:44,306
So you graduated last year?

141
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,845
You're a year older than me.

142
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,917
Which means you have
to do everything I say.

143
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,020
Come on. I'll be your
tour guide today.

144
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,842
This is B ward.

145
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:21,095
Group therapy's in there.

146
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,314
Showers, med station.

147
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,251
We keep it locked
for obvious reasons.

148
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,078
Also we keep some low
security risk patients here.

149
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,023
Ladies' rooms.

150
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,832
Your duties will range
from monitoring patients...

151
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:42,167
sitting on
group therapy sessions...

152
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:44,328
to assisting staff.

153
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,774
Speaking of which, brace
yourself. Nurse Hendricks.

154
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:50,241
Sara.

155
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:55,080
- You must be Clark.
- Yes, indeed. Nice to meet you.

156
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:57,883
- He's the new intern.
- Of course he is.

157
00:16:57,918 --> 00:16:59,783
I'm Anabelle Hendricks,
head nurse.

158
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,971
- Pleasure.
- I wondered where you went to.

159
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:06,367
Seems to be a regular
occurrence lately.

160
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:09,693
I'm sorry, I haven't
been feeling well.

161
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:15,234
You'll assist Nurse Hendricks
as well as other staff.

162
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:17,067
- I look forward to it.
- So do I.

163
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,905
It will be nice to have
a little muscle here.

164
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,708
may I speak with
you in the office, please?

165
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:24,005
Sure.

166
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,057
He's been up there...

167
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,031
for months.

168
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,125
Who has?

169
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,343
- We need to change the prescription.
- I signed off on everything.

170
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:01,747
You need to be there
at precisely...

171
00:18:01,782 --> 00:18:03,647
Sara?
Do you understand?

172
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,349
- Ready for more?
- Sure.

173
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,789
- Enjoy your stay here, Clark.
- Thank you very much.

174
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,656
What a bitch. Come on.

175
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,926
That's Crystal.

176
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,361
She's our resident
nymphomaniac.

177
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,934
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

178
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,519
To the unpleasant part
of this job.

179
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,070
Where we keep
high-risk patients.

180
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,710
You won't often be asked
to come down here.

181
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:06,712
Trust me, it's a good thing.

182
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:08,236
What is it?

183
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:13,252
Housing for potential
murderers, lunatics...

184
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:16,187
Your everyday
garden-variety maniacs.

185
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:21,458
- That sounds interesting.
- Look...

186
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,690
this is where they tuck away
people everyone wants to forget.

187
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,858
The ones
you never hear about.

188
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:33,105
Unless they have the chance to
act on their natural instinct.

189
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,638
Which is?

190
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,039
To rip you limb from limb.

191
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,610
Welcome to the madhouse.

192
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,548
After you.

193
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,642
Wallace.

194
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,396
Hey, sugar. They been
asking for you all day.

195
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:17,115
This is Clark. He'll be
with us for a while.

196
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,531
My condolences.

197
00:20:18,566 --> 00:20:19,912
Here you go.

198
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,186
He's going to need
your belt.

199
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,559
Here's the drill. Stay behind
the yellow line at all times.

200
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,092
If you need help...

201
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,696
push the alarm
at the end of the hall.

202
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:32,196
I need your pen...

203
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,563
and any other sharp
objects on you.

204
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,299
They can't get out,
can they?

205
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,931
That's what they
keep telling me.

206
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,671
Nice to meet you.

207
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:51,615
- Ready for this?
- Sure.

208
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,983
I've volunteered in a
couple of hospitals before.

209
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,415
I can't believe they keep
patients down here.

210
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,758
Run into that on your
volunteer work?

211
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,453
Let me out.

212
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:40,558
I have something for you.

213
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:50,559
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

214
00:21:50,594 --> 00:21:54,246
You are not going to
leave me down here!

215
00:21:54,281 --> 00:21:57,841
Get back here
and hook a sister up!

216
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,181
Severe obsessive-compulsive
disorder.

217
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,379
She has to do everything
in sets of nine.

218
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,824
Including the doses
of strychnine...

219
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:07,985
she gave
her preschool class.

220
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,962
- Paranoid?
- Homicidal.

221
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:32,648
Sara! Sara!

222
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:37,255
- Sara, help!
- No, it's okay. It's okay.

223
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,206
Drake!
Royce is at it again.

224
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:41,122
Can you bring
his meds down?

225
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:47,290
Royce, calm down! It will be fine.
Drake's on his way with your meds.

226
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,102
God! Sara!

227
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,539
Let go! Let go!

228
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:55,938
Drake!

229
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,222
It's all right.
He didn't hurt me!

230
00:23:10,257 --> 00:23:11,883
Drake!

231
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,160
He didn't hurt us.

232
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,999
Let's hope he gets
it right next time.

233
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,700
Here, big guy.

234
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:35,169
Thanks, kid.
I owe you one.

235
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,544
Let's get out of here.

236
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:50,495
Betty, this is Wallace.
I'm heading home.

237
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,461
Drake is here.

238
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:55,500
Dottie's got a roast waiting
that has my name all over it.

239
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:59,504
That's a big 10-4, Wallace.
You have a nice evening. Over.

240
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,995
10-4, Betty. You, too.
Over and out.

241
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,441
Hello?

242
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,395
Hey, I saw you.

243
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,104
Why don't you come out
and introduce yourself?

244
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,349
Drake,
are you still here?

245
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:49,751
I could use help. I have
a situation in the rec room.

246
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,767
Once again, Alice...

247
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:08,807
are you going to do what your
caretaker is requesting of you?

248
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:09,840
You're hurting my arm!

249
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:13,612
I'm trying to make sure
you don't hurt yourself.

250
00:25:13,647 --> 00:25:15,947
Take your pills
if you want to get better.

251
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:18,014
Doesn't that make sense,
sweetheart?

252
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:21,384
I'm going to ask that
you take your medication...

253
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:25,116
or I'm afraid I'll have to
resort to disciplinary measures.

254
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,119
He'll watch
when you are sleeping.

255
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:34,998
Do we have an understanding?

256
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:39,004
Do you think I enjoy
hurting you like this?

257
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,872
That medicine
don't work on me!

258
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:42,072
Alice!

259
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,676
- Stop!
- Bite your tongue, Carl!

260
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:46,576
You're hurting her!

261
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,512
Get away from me,
you faggot!

262
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:55,610
- It's okay.
- Drake!

263
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,679
You get back!

264
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,843
It's late for you,
isn't it?

265
00:26:05,878 --> 00:26:08,758
It wants me
to go to sleep now.

266
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,866
Let's go.

267
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,248
Kid!

268
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,864
Unbelievable.

269
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,704
I saw you come down here.
Why don't you come out?

270
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,413
Hey, kid, come on.

271
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,658
This isn't a good place to be.
You could get...

272
00:27:39,693 --> 00:27:41,148
hurt.

273
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:57,140
Safety alarm
at the end of the hall.

274
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:52,090
- Jesus!
- There's no one in there.

275
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,071
Dr. Morton, how long
have you worked here?

276
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:03,139
I've worked here
for 27 years.

277
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,743
- That's a long time.
- You have no idea.

278
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:08,278
That were you doing
down there after hours?

279
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:11,950
I followed the little boy.
That kid running around.

280
00:29:11,985 --> 00:29:13,750
He broke into my room.

281
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,776
I chased him to see
who he was.

282
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:20,258
It's strange that he runs
around here at night.

283
00:29:20,293 --> 00:29:23,661
I guess the whole place
is a little strange

284
00:29:23,696 --> 00:29:26,789
- Occupational hazard.
- I guess so.

285
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:32,370
That noise I keep hearing,
what is that?

286
00:29:32,405 --> 00:29:35,673
It sounds like it comes
from the basement.

287
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:38,309
I figured it was
the water pipes?

288
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:39,708
Maybe.

289
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:44,948
Well, what is it?

290
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:48,553
It's an old building.
It can be a variety of things.

291
00:29:48,588 --> 00:29:50,820
- But...
- Buildings are like people.

292
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:54,492
They remember everything that
happened to them through time.

293
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:56,893
Sometimes...

294
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,714
they don't like
what they remember.

295
00:29:59,749 --> 00:30:03,060
- What do you mean?
- A while back...

296
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:06,336
we had a patient
down in Cell 44.

297
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:13,044
He was the saddest sickest
subject I've ever come across.

298
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,963
One night he...

299
00:30:14,998 --> 00:30:16,813
dug himself out...

300
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:20,852
but he got turned around
and couldn't find his way.

301
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:22,519
What happened?

302
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,490
He jumped out
a third-story window.

303
00:30:25,525 --> 00:30:26,980
Did he die?

304
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,692
Some say he died when
he hit the ground.

305
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:34,255
Some say they caught him and
locked him back up. But I...

306
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:39,259
I believe
he's still here...

307
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,667
trying to dig his
way out and go home.

308
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:47,836
You believe that?

309
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:52,075
Either that or he came back
to run this place.

310
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,218
Mr. Stevens...

311
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,620
I have a wet cleanup in
the TV room.

312
00:30:57,655 --> 00:31:01,826
If you're not too busy,
perhaps you could mop it up?

313
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:03,487
Sure.

314
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,433
Sneaking around...

315
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,068
leaving maximum
security open.

316
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:14,789
You've had quite
a first night, Mr. Stevens.

317
00:31:14,824 --> 00:31:17,440
- I wasn't sneaking around.
- Speak to me.

318
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:21,813
Nurse Hendricks called for help
over the radio and I came.

319
00:31:21,848 --> 00:31:23,813
And?

320
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:28,953
And I got to the rec room and
realized she didn't need help...

321
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:31,706
being that she was using
a taser on a patient.

322
00:31:31,741 --> 00:31:34,425
Some patients have
to be constantly reminded...

323
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,793
who has the upper hand.

324
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:41,933
Refusing to take medication
doesn't warrant an electrical burn.

325
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:43,766
- Stevens...
- This place is a mess.

326
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:46,803
It's dirty, it's unsafe,
it's understaffed.

327
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:50,975
Are you aware there are children
running around here at night?

328
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,977
No one gets in or out
without my authorization.

329
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:57,215
What about the patient that
escaped from the basement?

330
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,775
Dr. Morton told me about...

331
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,952
a patient who escaped.

332
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:07,825
Dr. Morton doesn't know
what he's talking about.

333
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,760
Look, let's start over again,
all right?

334
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:15,633
While it's no secret this
place could use fixing up...

335
00:32:15,668 --> 00:32:19,718
most of the patients
housed here are content.

336
00:32:19,753 --> 00:32:23,768
You know why? They have
no place else to go.

337
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,478
I'll make you a deal.

338
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,613
Stick to the rules,
mind your own business.

339
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:33,618
I'll consider some of the
suggestions you put together.

340
00:32:33,653 --> 00:32:35,677
Are we in agreement,
Mr. Stevens?

341
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:38,220
Fine.

342
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,593
Well, hello there, busy bee.

343
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,083
Good morning.

344
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:53,636
What are you trying
to pull here?

345
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,406
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

346
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:57,425
Albert, things
will change here...

347
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,410
or I'm placing
a call to the board.

348
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:01,605
I know what you are up to.

349
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:12,555
Hey, new guy!

350
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,326
Hey there.
What are you doing?

351
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:17,460
What are you doing?

352
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,362
I'm on my way back
to my room.

353
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:23,167
Do you want to sit in on an
obsessive-compulsive group...

354
00:33:23,202 --> 00:33:26,671
at 3:30.
It's my own little session.

355
00:33:26,706 --> 00:33:27,737
It sounds great, really...

356
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:31,435
But, I don't want to get into
any more hot water.

357
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:35,878
- Why, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

358
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:39,906
I was in Frank's office
and I saw something weird.

359
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:44,120
He has a lot
of weird books.

360
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:46,589
One, in particular
on his desk...

361
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:49,149
he put it away
when he realized I saw it.

362
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:55,865
Are you sure you're not a private
detective disguised as an intern?

363
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:59,767
- I'm a dork?
- You're a dork.

364
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:02,905
The guy reads weird books.

365
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,810
Maybe he's learning about
his bedside manner.

366
00:34:05,845 --> 00:34:09,268
Sara, to the nurses' station,
please.

367
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,615
Copy.

368
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,448
- Got to go.
- Good luck.

369
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,965
Good night,
Nurse Hendricks.

370
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:41,500
- Everyone in bed?
- All tucked in.

371
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:47,917
I'm almost done.

372
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,614
If you don't need anything
I'll go lay down.

373
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,122
I'll check it out.

374
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:07,129
Is there something
we can help you with?

375
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:25,616
It's bedtime!

376
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:40,459
I don't have time for foolishness!
Come out and show yourself.

377
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:45,272
I don't have time to waste
and I don't want to hurt you.

378
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,539
Who are you?

379
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:00,019
You are only
hurting yourself.

380
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,803
Well...

381
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,072
I suppose if you aren't
going to come out...

382
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:19,140
you'll have to make yourself
cozy until Drake arrives.

383
00:36:19,175 --> 00:36:22,173
He'll find a way to convince
you to go back to your room.

384
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,002
Stop!

385
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,373
Why are you doing this?

386
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:01,080
Stop!

387
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,730
I know you're all devastated
by what happened.

388
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:51,569
I want to know which patient did
this and I want to know by tonight.

389
00:37:51,604 --> 00:37:54,506
Betty will assign
each of you a section.

390
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:57,373
I want you to
interview the residents.

391
00:37:57,408 --> 00:38:01,010
They trust you. I want you
to use that trust.

392
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:06,033
Keep the authorities out, or the
patients will give you nothing.

393
00:38:06,068 --> 00:38:11,022
Then we will thoroughly review
the security and safety protocol.

394
00:38:11,057 --> 00:38:13,458
- Let's get going.
- Roger that.

395
00:38:13,493 --> 00:38:16,294
I can't believe
this happened.

396
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:19,096
I worked with her
for 25 years.

397
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:21,465
She was such a nice lady.

398
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,065
Dr. Morton?

399
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,836
Get Dr. Shores,
take the West Wing.

400
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:27,303
Everything's okay.

401
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:30,796
Dr. Douglas said she was
with you before it happened.

402
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:35,279
- Did you see anyone?
- We heard someone in the hall...

403
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:38,550
and she went
to check it out.

404
00:38:38,585 --> 00:38:41,303
Then I heard loud music
and I...

405
00:38:41,338 --> 00:38:43,986
They think
a patient did it?

406
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:46,888
Clark! You and Drake
are in the basement.

407
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,984
Don't be afraid, Clarkie.
I'll protect you.

408
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,495
All right.
I have to go.

409
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,296
Yeah, sure.

410
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:02,405
- We didn't see...
- Anything.

411
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,042
- We were sleeping.
- Our door is locked.

412
00:39:05,077 --> 00:39:08,994
Tight as a drum.
Are you dating Sara?

413
00:39:09,029 --> 00:39:12,912
If you remember anything,
let me know.

414
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:16,452
I'll kill you, you freak!

415
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,757
I'll make sure you rot there
the rest of your life!

416
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:21,123
What's wrong?

417
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:24,252
I'll teach this freak
to show respect.

418
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,363
Take a break.

419
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,889
I'm almost done here.
I'll be out in a minute.

420
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:36,069
Why don't you come inside and
I'll make us a Remy Martins?

421
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:39,825
It's the ones
who protest too much...

422
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,310
that end up wearing
their wives' panties!

423
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,114
Why won't you
talk to me?

424
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,827
It might help you
sort things out.

425
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,973
How does it feel to be
convinced something is there...

426
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,407
when logic tells you
it's not?

427
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:57,753
I thought
I was hearing things.

428
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,279
Now you know what
madness feels like.

429
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,761
That's a feeling
you'll never forget.

430
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:05,895
Why are you sitting
in the dark?

431
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,525
Illumination only reminds me
of what I've become.

432
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,701
What's your name?

433
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:15,170
That's a subjective question.

434
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,040
There was a problem here
last night.

435
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:20,943
So we're taking time
with each resident...

436
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:24,846
asking them if they heard
or saw anything unusual.

437
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,836
Funny you'd ask a madman...

438
00:41:28,871 --> 00:41:31,322
if he's seen
anything unusual.

439
00:41:31,357 --> 00:41:33,051
All right, thank you.

440
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,889
Pretty strange place,
this Cunningham Hall.

441
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:45,936
- How so?
- Bad things going down here.

442
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:48,037
But you know that.

443
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,839
What kind of bad things?

444
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:54,061
Take that sick individual
lurking around, for instance.

445
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:58,249
Someone who's comforted
by the warmth of fresh blood.

446
00:41:58,284 --> 00:41:59,849
Who do you think it is?

447
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:02,682
You're a smart boy,
you'll figure it out.

448
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,789
Is it you?

449
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:11,228
The top of the food chain would be
a good place to start looking.

450
00:42:11,263 --> 00:42:13,492
Are you speaking
of Dr. Franks?

451
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,212
They're cell numbers
on a prescription to me.

452
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:33,967
Go to Betty or Wallace to find
out who the hell they are.

453
00:42:34,002 --> 00:42:37,653
They wouldn't know their
own names if you asked them.

454
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:41,525
Can you tell me what the patient
in cell 44 was diagnosed with?

455
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,692
I just keep them doped up.

456
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,545
Do you know
what medication he's on?

457
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,329
You sure have
a lot of questions.

458
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:50,751
Risperdex. That's what
they're all on down there.

459
00:42:50,786 --> 00:42:54,138
- An antidepressant.
- Have you seen the place?

460
00:42:54,173 --> 00:42:55,867
Thank you, Grace.

461
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,809
You're breaking
rule number one...

462
00:42:58,844 --> 00:43:00,578
about working
in a place like this.

463
00:43:00,613 --> 00:43:01,877
What's that?

464
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,540
Taking what
the patients say seriously.

465
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:09,585
I'm not.
Believe me, I'm not.

466
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,389
I did hear Hendricks
and Franks arguing...

467
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:14,653
the night she got killed.

468
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:19,861
You have to understand these
patients are totally delusional.

469
00:43:19,896 --> 00:43:24,030
They'll tell you things they
actually believe to be true.

470
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:28,405
But hardcore schizophrenics in
particular can't be trusted.

471
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:33,310
Take what they say
with a grain of salt.

472
00:43:33,345 --> 00:43:34,777
I understand that.

473
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:40,579
It just seemed weird.
He was being cryptic.

474
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,352
They're paranoid.

475
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:48,592
They have it out for Franks because
he's keeping them locked in here.

476
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:52,162
You're reading too much
into this conversation.

477
00:43:52,197 --> 00:43:55,264
You can never trust
a schizo.

478
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,001
Why are all the patients
in the basement...

479
00:43:57,036 --> 00:43:58,567
on the same medication?

480
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:03,266
Because I'm sure they're keeping
them seriously tranquilized.

481
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:26,997
I used to love to play
outside this time of day.

482
00:44:27,032 --> 00:44:28,864
Me and my friends.

483
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:31,015
We played kick-the-can...

484
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:33,131
sometimes dodge ball.

485
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,706
I was good at that.

486
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:40,232
Too afraid of getting hit
by the ball, I guess.

487
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:46,550
Then one day
things started to go bad.

488
00:44:46,585 --> 00:44:47,683
How so?

489
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:49,686
I started seeing stuff.

490
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:52,719
Stuff before it happened.

491
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:57,193
One day my parents dropped me off
here to have some tests run.

492
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,331
And they never came back.

493
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,401
That's a rough thing
to carry with you.

494
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:10,931
You can try to steer your life
in the direction you want, but...

495
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:16,113
everything happens
as it's meant to be.

496
00:45:16,148 --> 00:45:17,580
Maybe so.

497
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:25,718
I think you're not meant
to be here anymore.

498
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,392
You're right.

499
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:34,844
But the day I leave here...

500
00:45:34,879 --> 00:45:37,192
will be the day
that I'm dead.

501
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:43,035
That's one of the bad things about
knowing stuff before it happens.

502
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:48,506
My little problem...

503
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,580
stems from the fact...

504
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:55,016
I was never allowed to get
in touch with my inner child.

505
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:58,454
I'm a vulnerable child...

506
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,105
trapped inside
an adult's body.

507
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,722
And wearing
an adult diaper.

508
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,831
- Up yours, Jimmy!
- Okay, calm down.

509
00:46:07,866 --> 00:46:10,901
Look, we're all
grieving right now.

510
00:46:10,936 --> 00:46:13,165
Some of us feel vulnerable...

511
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,323
or depressed.

512
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:18,340
Or scared.

513
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:22,246
That's right, Alice.
What makes you feel scared?

514
00:46:22,281 --> 00:46:25,272
It won't stop scaring me.

515
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:28,484
What won't?

516
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:32,089
I try to close my eyes,
make it go away.

517
00:46:32,124 --> 00:46:35,624
It's always right there,
watching me.

518
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:38,526
What is this 'it' that
you're referring to?

519
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:41,030
The ghost.

520
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,433
What ghost?

521
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:51,458
The one that runs through
the house at night.

522
00:46:51,493 --> 00:46:54,378
It's always watching me
through the windows.

523
00:46:54,413 --> 00:46:56,539
What does it want from you?

524
00:46:57,881 --> 00:47:01,817
To make sure that I never
forget what madness feels like.

525
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:54,837
It's Betty.
Did I awake you?

526
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,573
Not at all.
I was just getting up.

527
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:01,310
Great. I wanted you to know
your badge is ready.

528
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:04,581
Dr. Franks wants to know if
you had anything to report...

529
00:48:04,616 --> 00:48:06,315
from yesterday's interviews.

530
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:09,953
I've still got one more patient
I'd love to talk to down there...

531
00:48:09,988 --> 00:48:14,623
but it seems like they
were all in their cells.

532
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:18,662
Drake checked the locks and it
didn't appear they could get out.

533
00:48:18,697 --> 00:48:21,916
Just keep me posted.
I've got to type up...

534
00:48:21,951 --> 00:48:25,135
the findings and give
them to the investigator.

535
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:27,365
Okay. Fantastic.

536
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,173
So nice of you to come down.

537
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:34,878
We seldom get visitors down
here in our little pit of despair.

538
00:48:34,913 --> 00:48:37,781
Why did you stop talking to me
last time I was down here?

539
00:48:37,816 --> 00:48:39,874
I'd run out of things to say.

540
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:45,322
Why don't you come into
the light where I can see you?

541
00:48:45,357 --> 00:48:47,890
Come on,
we're friends by now.

542
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:52,963
Let's just say I suffered a
slight disfigurement as a child.

543
00:48:52,998 --> 00:48:56,233
Since then, I choose
to live in the shadows.

544
00:48:56,268 --> 00:48:57,825
All right, then.

545
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,730
Can you get out of this cell?

546
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:06,208
Only if someone lets me.

547
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:09,945
No more talking in circles.
Answer the question.

548
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,317
Are you wondering if that little
boy you keep seeing...

549
00:49:13,352 --> 00:49:16,987
is somehow getting
the keys and letting me out?

550
00:49:17,022 --> 00:49:18,887
What little boy?

551
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:21,891
Now who's talking in circles?

552
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:26,191
Clark, I've got Sara on
line one out here.

553
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:28,697
I'll be right up.

554
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:33,337
We'll continue
this conversation later?

555
00:49:33,372 --> 00:49:35,328
You can call me Ben.

556
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:49,052
We have
to stop meeting like this.

557
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:50,883
What will the patients say?

558
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:53,989
I think it's
a little late for that.

559
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:02,966
So, did you finish up
your interviews?

560
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:05,769
Basically.
What are you taking?

561
00:50:05,804 --> 00:50:08,070
Oh, I have a cold.

562
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:10,674
I interviewed all the patients
that I was assigned to.

563
00:50:10,709 --> 00:50:13,809
- Their stories were out there.
- Mine too.

564
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:18,448
Mrs. Idelson told me that the guy
from 'Wheel of Fortune' did it.

565
00:50:18,483 --> 00:50:20,245
That's possible.

566
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,187
I had one guy,
he's interesting...

567
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:26,321
but I don't think
he knows anything.

568
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:29,553
Sic Franks on him.
Let the cops do the rest.

569
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:32,490
Hang on, I forgot a fork.

570
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:48,137
What are you doing?

571
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,613
I'm sorry. They were
sticking out of your purse.

572
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:58,453
Some cold, huh?

573
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:00,956
Why you taking Risperdex?

574
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,792
Here goes.

575
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:12,601
When I was a little girl
I had problems focusing...

576
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:18,006
and I was later diagnosed with
really minor schizophrenia.

577
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:22,595
But I got put on Risperdex
and it leveled me out.

578
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:25,857
I haven't really had any
symptoms since I was a kid.

579
00:51:25,892 --> 00:51:29,084
Is that how you got
interested in mental health?

580
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:37,794
Still want to be my friend?

581
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:39,022
Sure.

582
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,648
Crazy chicks are wild.

583
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,967
- You jerk.
- I'm kidding.

584
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:50,040
You're all right now?

585
00:51:50,075 --> 00:51:52,541
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

586
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:56,307
- Look, don't tell anyone.
- I won't.

587
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:02,017
- Those pills are red.
- So?

588
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:05,078
The Risperdex Grace showed me,
the pills were blue.

589
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:10,885
I'm sure a bunch of psychos are
on a much stronger dose than I am.

590
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:24,339
This is the only way out, Sara!
Carl finally got to go home.

591
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:29,880
Please go to your rooms!

592
00:52:29,915 --> 00:52:30,879
Ghosts.

593
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:34,680
Would somebody get
Dr. Franks on the radio!

594
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:41,656
- What happened?
- I was bringing in the games.

595
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:45,729
We were going to play Chutes
'n' Ladders, then this.

596
00:52:45,764 --> 00:52:48,463
Maybe he hated
Chutes 'n' Ladders.

597
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,668
Did you see him talking
to anyone before he came in?

598
00:52:51,703 --> 00:52:54,269
He went out
to get his medication.

599
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:58,070
- What was he given?
- An antidepressant?

600
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:04,479
- Grace! Was Carl just here?
- Half hour ago.

601
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:07,083
- Did you see him talking to anybody?
- Other than himself? No.

602
00:53:07,118 --> 00:53:09,486
- What did you give him?
- What I always do.

603
00:53:09,521 --> 00:53:11,054
Are we starting with Q&A again?

604
00:53:11,089 --> 00:53:12,487
Because I don't have time.

605
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:15,441
Grace, I'm sorry,
what did you give him?

606
00:53:15,476 --> 00:53:18,361
I gave him his usual dose
of Happy Tabs.

607
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:19,385
Thank you.

608
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:32,340
- Ben!
- I haven't gone anywhere.

609
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:35,712
You said something about
the medication they gave you.

610
00:53:35,747 --> 00:53:39,082
- Does it help?
- I wouldn't know. I don't take it.

611
00:53:39,117 --> 00:53:41,985
But I do have
a nice mosaic on the wall...

612
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,421
I've done with
my unused pills.

613
00:53:44,456 --> 00:53:46,707
But, Ben,
why don't you take it?

614
00:53:46,742 --> 00:53:48,959
They wouldn't help me
if I did.

615
00:53:48,994 --> 00:53:50,258
Why not?

616
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:53,029
A hospital
is a place of business.

617
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:55,130
When people get better...

618
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:59,185
there are less bodies in bed.
Doesn't that make sense?

619
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:03,206
They give patients weak
medication to keep them sick?

620
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:04,606
Look around you.

621
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:06,836
The loonies here
only seem to get worse.

622
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:10,663
Take your friend Carl,
for instance.

623
00:54:10,698 --> 00:54:13,450
He took his meds,
like a good boy.

624
00:54:13,485 --> 00:54:15,035
And look what happened
to him.

625
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:16,551
How do you know about Carl?

626
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:19,953
Did I say something
happened to him?

627
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:28,496
I can't believe
you talked me into this.

628
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:32,991
I need to check out the med
station. I'll be out in 3 minutes.

629
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,329
Here they are!

630
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:11,273
Hurry.
Let's get out of here.

631
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,651
Why are we doing this?

632
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:26,122
I'll send the pills to a friend
who works at the university hospital.

633
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:29,853
I figured whoever's doing this
is on the wrong medication.

634
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:34,296
Look, Carl was ready
to go home.

635
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:37,133
According to Grace, he was on
a huge dose of tranquilizers.

636
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:39,069
He shouldn't have been
able to get out of bed...

637
00:55:39,104 --> 00:55:40,969
much less hang himself.

638
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:44,706
What?

639
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,974
You're cute
when you're sleuthing.

640
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:52,574
Good night.

641
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:56,115
Good night.

642
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,908
Sara?

643
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:58,778
There is no place like home.

644
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,623
If Franks finds out we're in
his office, we're screwed.

645
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:11,718
It was a little boy. I've been
seeing him since I got here.

646
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,432
At first I thought it was one
of the gardener's kids.

647
00:57:15,467 --> 00:57:18,060
- What? You're sure he isn't?
- No way.

648
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:20,527
Look...

649
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,873
I know this sounds strange.

650
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:28,061
But I think this place
actually might be haunted.

651
00:57:28,096 --> 00:57:30,906
I wouldn't believe it
if I hadn't seen it myself.

652
00:57:30,941 --> 00:57:33,716
But I think Alice saw
something, and Franks, too.

653
00:57:33,751 --> 00:57:37,447
Why else would
he have these books?

654
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:40,914
What?

655
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:47,831
It's just between your theories
on the medication, and Franks.

656
00:57:47,866 --> 00:57:49,531
Now you're seeing ghosts?

657
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,634
Maybe your surroundings
are affecting you.

658
00:57:51,669 --> 00:57:54,102
I'm not crazy, Sara.

659
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:58,540
He was right outside my window.
He looked right at me.

660
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,668
- Believe me.
- Okay, okay, I do.

661
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:09,953
Where do they keep
the patient records?

662
00:58:09,988 --> 00:58:11,887
The nurses' station.

663
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:16,292
- Come on.
- Get your hands off me!

664
00:58:16,327 --> 00:58:18,293
I didn't kill that bitch!

665
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,562
There's something you
ought to understand.

666
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:24,133
Nothing goes on here that
I don't know or hear about.

667
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:28,037
Then you know that
I'll be back for you.

668
00:58:28,072 --> 00:58:29,890
And you, snitch!

669
00:58:29,925 --> 00:58:31,673
You're next.

670
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,776
I'm going to skin you alive!

671
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:35,343
Nobody's safe here!

672
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:37,814
- Muzzle him.
- Nobody's safe!

673
00:58:37,849 --> 00:58:39,814
That poor, troubled boy.

674
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,317
I heard he was raised
in a carnival.

675
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,549
Now we know where
the narcotics disappeared to.

676
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:49,724
What happened?

677
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:52,829
They're questioning him regarding
Nurse Hendricks' death.

678
00:58:52,864 --> 00:58:55,063
Franks found her taser
in his things.

679
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:58,795
They also found out he had
relations with a patient.

680
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,486
Who are you?

681
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:10,471
<i>Clark, you're there?</i>

682
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:13,743
I'm sorry, yes, this is he.

683
01:00:13,778 --> 01:00:15,979
<i>This is Tom, from the lab.</i>

684
01:00:16,014 --> 01:00:17,312
Hi, Tom.

685
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:20,116
<i>There is no narcotics in
the drugs that you gave me.</i>

686
01:00:20,151 --> 01:00:22,949
<i>- What?
- Just placebos.</i>

687
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:29,392
All right. Thank you
for looking into that.

688
01:00:29,427 --> 01:00:31,257
You were right about
the medication.

689
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:36,065
The Risperdex they dispense
here is just a placebo.

690
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:39,686
Taking matters into our
own hands? Very aggressive.

691
01:00:39,721 --> 01:00:43,272
I'll call the board first
thing Monday morning.

692
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:45,273
One patient is going
into psychoses...

693
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:48,443
and acting out because
he's not getting his meds.

694
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:53,499
I wouldn't tell anyone about
our discovery until then.

695
01:00:53,534 --> 01:00:58,521
You wouldn't want Franks
to cover up their dirty work.

696
01:00:58,556 --> 01:01:00,352
They arrested Drake today...

697
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:03,355
and I don't think he did it.

698
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,598
I heard Hendricks arguing
with Franks the day she died.

699
01:01:08,633 --> 01:01:11,599
I think he's connected
and she knew about it.

700
01:01:11,634 --> 01:01:15,670
They say the obvious answer
usually is the answer.

701
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:20,267
It's in front of your eyes. You
have to be willing to see it.

702
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:26,049
How do you know about
everything going on here?

703
01:01:26,084 --> 01:01:28,116
I'm smart.

704
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:32,255
Be honest with me. Can you
get out of this cell?

705
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:34,989
Let me go out, too!

706
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,093
Why do you get out
and I don't?

707
01:01:37,128 --> 01:01:40,163
Only in my mind, Royce.

708
01:01:40,198 --> 01:01:42,154
Only in my mind.

709
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:46,636
Tell me about the ghost
of the little boy.

710
01:01:46,671 --> 01:01:49,539
He's showing up
everywhere now.

711
01:01:49,574 --> 01:01:51,973
He must be fond of you.

712
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:55,276
You've got work to do.

713
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:59,680
You'd better get back upstairs
before you miss any more action.

714
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:05,555
Admittance, diagnosis,
release dates.

715
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:07,924
Here's everything you need.

716
01:02:07,959 --> 01:02:09,585
This is amazing.

717
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:12,393
Great job.

718
01:02:12,428 --> 01:02:14,055
Check this out.

719
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:18,000
Here are patients that
were rehabbed and released...

720
01:02:18,035 --> 01:02:19,865
since Franks took over.

721
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:23,471
- How many?
- None.

722
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:26,669
None?
This is unbelievable.

723
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:32,941
This proves that he keeps patients
sick so they can't go home.

724
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:36,718
Ben London.

725
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:41,357
Cell 44, schizophrenic,
died in 1989?

726
01:02:41,392 --> 01:02:43,848
- So?
- So he's not dead.

727
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:47,595
I talked to him this morning.

728
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:50,031
You're losing me.

729
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:54,196
Dr. Morton told me about a patient
who escaped from cell 44 years ago.

730
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:58,207
Maybe Ben was
the one who escaped.

731
01:02:58,242 --> 01:03:01,077
And Franks tried
to cover it up by...

732
01:03:01,112 --> 01:03:03,011
saying he died.

733
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:08,247
When they got around to catching
and bringing him back...

734
01:03:08,282 --> 01:03:11,247
They never bothered to take
him off the deceased list.

735
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:13,652
Exactly.

736
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:23,030
What are you thinking?

737
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:26,298
I don't know.

738
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:30,862
You have to be thinking
about something.

739
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:35,040
You can tell me.
We're in this together.

740
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:30,450
Perfect.

741
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:37,190
Kitchen's closed!

742
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,671
Let me see...

743
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:50,278
peaches...

744
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:52,804
gravy, pudding...

745
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,484
meatloaf!

746
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:59,215
Just what the doctor ordered.

747
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:15,929
Pickles?

748
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:20,307
Pickles.

749
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:30,407
Ketchup.

750
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:36,459
Ketchup, ketchup, ketchup,
ketchup, ketchup.

751
01:06:36,494 --> 01:06:37,653
Got you!

752
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:07,520
- Who are you?
- It's Clark.

753
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:12,087
What did you do to me?

754
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:16,924
Where am I?

755
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:24,704
What's happening to me?

756
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:32,747
It's okay.
Sara, look at me.

757
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:35,649
I work with you at
the hospital. Do you remember?

758
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:43,956
Look, I think you forgot
to take your medication.

759
01:07:43,991 --> 01:07:47,157
Take a couple of these
and it will be better.

760
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:02,222
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

761
01:08:02,257 --> 01:08:04,869
I just can't figure out...

762
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:09,151
what's real
and what's a dream.

763
01:08:09,186 --> 01:08:10,311
Come on.

764
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:13,985
Come here.

765
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:17,589
All right.

766
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:23,798
...coming to the area
late today...

767
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:29,505
bringing along chances of
thunderstorm and low temperatures.

768
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:32,341
And now, for more informations
on our top story...

769
01:08:32,376 --> 01:08:35,576
lets go back to Peter Garcia.

770
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:40,249
Sheriff Johnson warns
that the escaped suspect...

771
01:08:40,284 --> 01:08:42,869
who was detained
on suspicion of murder...

772
01:08:42,904 --> 01:08:45,419
should be considered
armed and dangerous.

773
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:48,640
He's known to go by
the alias of Drake Anderson.

774
01:08:48,675 --> 01:08:51,669
Anderson is 5 foot 10,
has dark brown hair...

775
01:08:51,704 --> 01:08:54,301
and sports the tattoo
of a spider on his neck.

776
01:08:54,336 --> 01:08:56,864
Anyone with information
leading to his capture...

777
01:08:56,899 --> 01:09:00,027
should report it to
the Kirkside Sheriff's Department.

778
01:09:11,447 --> 01:09:13,315
- What happened?
- Thank God you're okay.

779
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:15,983
- Someone killed Dr. Morton.
- What?

780
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:18,782
I'm scared. I don't know
who to trust anymore.

781
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:22,356
- Drake got out.
- What?

782
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:26,122
I heard it on the radio.
He escaped last night.

783
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:30,831
If it was him, then
he's probably long gone.

784
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:34,324
They searched this whole place
with a fine-tooth comb.

785
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:38,607
That investigator wants to
ask us a few questions.

786
01:09:38,642 --> 01:09:41,057
Not now. I'm going
to talk to Franks.

787
01:09:41,092 --> 01:09:43,473
- What?
- I'm going to talk to Franks!

788
01:09:47,983 --> 01:09:50,651
Open the goddamn door!

789
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:53,849
Franks, I know you're
in there! Open the door!

790
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,639
Jesus!

791
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:14,708
- It isn't Drake.
- What are you talking about?

792
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:18,547
I asked the cops and they said
he was arrested 20 minutes ago.

793
01:10:18,582 --> 01:10:21,016
- He stole a car in Dallas.
- I'm leaving.

794
01:10:21,051 --> 01:10:21,982
Wait, wait.

795
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:24,178
I don't know
what's going on here.

796
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,122
Come with me if you want,
but I'm not staying.

797
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:31,225
Okay. Okay.
Wait, I'll go.

798
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,862
Come with me to the office
and I'll grab a few things.

799
01:10:33,897 --> 01:10:35,296
Come on.

800
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:37,498
I want to be
sure security...

801
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:39,066
can keep the patients
locked down.

802
01:10:39,101 --> 01:10:42,867
They won't be safe here.
Nobody will be safe here.

803
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:46,642
I'll tell Betty we're going.

804
01:10:46,677 --> 01:10:47,942
Fine.

805
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:52,380
But make it quick. I want to get
as far away as possible.

806
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:54,541
I will.

807
01:10:57,052 --> 01:10:58,986
We'll be okay.

808
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:02,422
Nothing will happen with all
those cops hanging outside.

809
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:12,826
Here.

810
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:24,211
What if it's not a person
doing all this?

811
01:11:24,246 --> 01:11:28,384
- What do you mean?
- What if it's like Morton said?

812
01:11:28,419 --> 01:11:31,020
What if something
happened in the building...

813
01:11:31,055 --> 01:11:33,455
and it's never forgotten?

814
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:35,456
Clark...

815
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:38,158
it was a person.

816
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:41,463
And if it was a patient,
they're all in lockdown.

817
01:11:41,498 --> 01:11:43,090
We're fine.

818
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:54,073
Now go back. I'll just
finish up around here.

819
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,892
<i>- It's right in front of your eyes.
- Clark, are you there?</i>

820
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:59,401
Right in front of your eyes.

821
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:05,312
I just can't figure out...

822
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:07,682
what's real
and what's a dream.

823
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:10,018
I was diagnosed
with schizophrenia.

824
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:11,418
Sara.

825
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:13,353
Thanks for your help,
Officer.

826
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:17,191
Also, I have
a list of patients.

827
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:20,320
I'll leave it in a red folder
in my outbox.

828
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:24,130
Not a problem.

829
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:28,329
You have my cell number.

830
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:32,732
Okay, all right, thank you.

831
01:13:57,833 --> 01:13:59,596
Why did you drug me?

832
01:14:00,702 --> 01:14:02,602
I just gave you a calmative.

833
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:05,574
You were acting
really strange.

834
01:14:05,609 --> 01:14:07,574
It was you.

835
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:11,409
I should've figured it out
the other night when you had...

836
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:13,813
your relapse.

837
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:16,617
You're wrong.

838
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:21,385
Ben told me the answer was
right in front of my eyes.

839
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:26,593
- Who?
- Cell 44. Ben London.

840
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:31,211
He must have seen you the night
you killed Nurse Hendricks.

841
01:14:31,246 --> 01:14:35,794
That's why he told me the answer
was right in front of my eyes.

842
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,408
There's no one in cell 44.

843
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:46,312
- Don't lie to me.
- It's used for storage.

844
01:14:48,717 --> 01:14:50,786
You were the one
who told me...

845
01:14:50,821 --> 01:14:53,653
never to trust a schizo.

846
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:57,454
I can prove he's there.

847
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:07,529
There you are. I've been
looking for you.

848
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:10,568
Is something wrong?

849
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:22,647
Ben!

850
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:26,687
Ben! Ben, what's going on?

851
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:29,213
Why didn't you
tell me it was Sara?

852
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:35,910
I'm going to let you
out of here.

853
01:15:35,945 --> 01:15:38,259
So you can get
some place safe.

854
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:42,550
But I want
to see your face.

855
01:15:42,585 --> 01:15:45,065
I suppose
it's time to go home.

856
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:02,623
That kid I keep seeing
running around the halls?

857
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:06,617
It's a little strange that
he runs around here at night.

858
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:13,235
Maybe your surroundings
are starting to affect you.

859
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:15,396
I'm not crazy, Sara.

860
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:19,774
Now you know what
madness feels like.

861
01:16:19,809 --> 01:16:22,377
That's a feeling
you'll never forget.

862
01:16:22,412 --> 01:16:23,708
Hey, good looking.

863
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:30,217
We've got work to do.

864
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:57,811
Boys are not toys, Les!

865
01:16:57,846 --> 01:17:03,685
He was the sickest patient
that I ever come across.

866
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:06,288
There you are. I've been
looking for you.

867
01:17:06,323 --> 01:17:08,950
You need to teach you
some respect!

868
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:16,231
What I'd love to do is change
this place for the better.

869
01:17:16,266 --> 01:17:18,222
That's really why
I came here.

870
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,062
Betty, go to one.

871
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:27,608
Have my car sent around.

872
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:30,045
Where are my keys
to the medication?

873
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,376
Never mind.

874
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:53,767
"This letter is in regards...

875
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:56,930
to the tuition fees for
Clark Stevens' internship.

01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:00,074
Since his unfortunate death...

877

we'd like to arrange
a refund of payment.

882

- Hi, Dr. Franks.
- You!

883
01:19:13,849 --> 01:19:16,585
Clark, have you
lost your mind?

884
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:17,882
It's Ben!

885
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:21,321
- It's Ben London!
- Ben London.

886
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:24,993
Do you remember me, Al?
That little boy?

887
01:19:25,028 --> 01:19:28,762
The one that you
and Hendricks...

888
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:32,400
and all the others
never once tried to help.

889
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:33,731
Ben London.

890
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:41,041
Listen, I can help you.

891
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:43,567
It's too late
for that now!

892
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:16,807
Help!

893
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:04,925
Hello?
I'm at Cunningham Hall.

894
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,361
I'm in the basement.
There are cops outside.

895
01:21:10,165 --> 01:21:11,564
Help me!

896
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:03,482
Come on, Sara.

897
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:06,419
You're as screwed up
as I am.

898
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:09,286
We belong together.

899
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:15,397
Come on, darling.
Get up out of the corner.

900
01:22:15,432 --> 01:22:17,456
You're making me crazy.

901
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:24,901
- I didn't do anything.
- I know. It's just that...

902
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:28,208
I came back to this place...

903
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:31,178
to get rid of memories
I had here.

904
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:36,251
Unfortunately,
you're now one of them.

905
01:22:36,286 --> 01:22:38,987
But I'm just like you.

906
01:22:39,022 --> 01:22:41,454
I'm so sorry...

907
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:44,059
but I can't leave
any loose ends.

908
01:22:44,094 --> 01:22:46,357
Ben, I can protect you.

909
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:51,229
I found your file.

910
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:55,068
I took it...

911
01:22:55,103 --> 01:22:57,571
and I'm keeping it
safe for you.

912
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:02,976
Where?

913
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:05,912
We can both go away.

914
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:15,221
They won't even know
you were here.

915
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:54,160
Clark.

916
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:56,220
Clark's not here,
anymore.

917
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:01,393
Clark doesn't even exist.
