<b> A 007 Production:
Zahid Bhatti Presents..

2
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:41,131
"A belief in a supernatural source
Evil is not necessary.

3
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:45,211
Men, by itself,
are quite capable of all evil ... "

4
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,771
My God ...

5
00:01:51,075 --> 00:01:53,300
How did we get to this point?

6
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,227
GIVE WOMEN THEIR RIGHTS
GIVE PROTECTION TO WOMEN

00:04:00,342 --> 00:04:03,342
Directed by ...

8
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,572
How do you feel, soft?

9
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:25,712
I'm fine.
It still hurts a bit the head.

10
00:05:27,522 --> 00:05:29,461
Nothing! Well you said.

11
00:05:30,652 --> 00:05:34,458
Sorry, Trixie.
It was supposed to run well.

12
00:06:20,322 --> 00:06:22,323
Do not get up, Mija on Shoes!

13
00:06:29,954 --> 00:06:32,049
They must be kidding me.

14
00:06:34,277 --> 00:06:36,323
I trusted you, Boom-Boom.

15
00:06:36,524 --> 00:06:39,385
- E betrayed me.
- Sorry.

16
00:06:39,885 --> 00:06:42,032
Are you feeling sad, honey?

17
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:43,970
Thankfully,
stabbed in the back!

18
00:06:43,977 --> 00:06:48,108
So much for subtle wit, Gage.
Know why we are here.

19
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,343
Who hell are you?

20
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:53,998
Besides a good chunk of vulva
I loved beating like a door.

21
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,583
Where, Gage?

22
00:06:55,825 --> 00:06:57,453
Well, honey ...

23
00:06:57,454 --> 00:07:00,502
... not sure
to what you're referring to.

24
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:04,988
And even though he knew, would have to ask you,
very politely, of course ...

25
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:06,947
for mo ... branches.

26
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,243
Whatever.

27
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:11,682
Here we go.

28
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,514
Are you still screwed me, Camero?

29
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:18,638
Obviously not.

30
00:07:19,842 --> 00:07:20,929
Yes ..

31
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,776
That's right.

32
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:27,475
That's right.

33
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:30,269
I knew you could not resist
Mr. Sticky much longer.

34
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,108
- You said you liked the area.
- That's right.

35
00:07:35,182 --> 00:07:39,125
- Where is the material?
- Chupa-mos, the dyke psychopath.

36
00:07:43,032 --> 00:07:46,500
If I tell you where they are buried,
'll kill me with it.

37
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:50,399
So why did you and the
your entourage of stuffed rats

38
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,777
not join and make me a tip?

39
00:07:56,468 --> 00:07:58,814
How about doings thou me one to me?

40
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,735
So are buried.

41
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,988
You are laughing at you for what?

42
00:08:12,989 --> 00:08:15,364
You.
I'm laughing at the thought of you.

43
00:08:15,365 --> 00:08:17,588
Always with his nose
briefs in the other.

44
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,586
I do what I want when I want.

45
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:21,909
Muff as you are
that will always be used.

46
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:27,560
I told you never to call me that.

47
00:08:28,627 --> 00:08:30,398
Lets you, please leave it.

48
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,245
Fuck you, loose!
It is because of you that he is here.

49
00:08:35,773 --> 00:08:37,995
4 HOURS BEFORE

50
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:48,567
- What happened?
- Open the bag!

51
00:08:52,963 --> 00:08:54,041
Let.

52
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:56,569
What the fuck!

53
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:00,023
What the hell is wrong with you?

54
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:03,479
How difficult was it to put a
single tablet in the cup?

55
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,682
- What are you doing?
- She is a brunette with blond pussy, Hel.

56
00:09:06,683 --> 00:09:09,732
- With the taste of dog with two dicks.
- Enough!

57
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:12,104
- Behave yourself.
- You promised me that she was capable.

58
00:09:12,105 --> 00:09:14,586
- What happened?
- I do not know. I did everything you said,

59
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,120
... the fault is not mine!
- The hell is that it is not!

60
00:09:17,365 --> 00:09:20,279
Everything is destroyed.
Now I'll never find them.

61
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,034
- 35.34.08.81 N. ..
- What?

62
00:09:23,194 --> 00:09:26,150
The Gage wrote it in a photograph.
A kind of desert, seen from space.

63
00:09:26,369 --> 00:09:29,951
- And that serves us so?
- Can be coordinated vector.

64
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:32,087
- Are you sure about the numbers?
- Yes.

65
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:34,582
I have photographic memory.
My mother used to say he wanted

66
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:36,450
I was born a dwarf ...
- Come on!

67
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,965
Tell us where to dig and the door rises.

68
00:09:53,517 --> 00:09:55,128
It's as simple as that.

69
00:09:59,955 --> 00:10:02,905
- What is happening to it?
- My heart ...

70
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:04,601
- Gage?
- No, Trixie, stop!

71
00:10:07,884 --> 00:10:09,626
Cow stupid shit.

72
00:10:09,827 --> 00:10:11,337
More stupid than a door.

73
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,695
Now ... take me away ...

74
00:10:14,896 --> 00:10:17,663
... or childbirth her neck.
- Party at home. Are we the shit.

75
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:18,684
What?

76
00:10:20,006 --> 00:10:22,279
Give me the keys and the gun ...

77
00:10:22,344 --> 00:10:24,791
... right now.
- Okay.

78
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,454
Do him no harm.

79
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,665
Okay ... now the pistol.

80
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:41,400
Holy shit.

81
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:44,037
I blew up with the tomatoes.

82
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:46,527
That's two you owe me,
Spit semen.

83
00:10:46,528 --> 00:10:48,623
- My God, you could have hit me!
- But do not hit.

84
00:10:48,724 --> 00:10:50,686
- You're crazy!
- No problem.

85
00:10:51,437 --> 00:10:54,901
He finished the game, Gage.
Next stop: village brown.

86
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:56,846
If I tell you ...

87
00:10:57,178 --> 00:11:00,388
The Pinky ... I will do things
not even imagine.

88
00:11:01,955 --> 00:11:03,085
Pinky?

89
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:05,265
What is the Pinky to do with it?

90
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:07,641
With that shit think
they are dealing?

91
00:11:08,153 --> 00:11:10,491
- You work for Pinky?
- Yes

92
00:11:10,592 --> 00:11:12,771
Now you are no longer
so smart, do you?

93
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:16,714
His goats stupid
Pinky when you know it ...

94
00:11:16,815 --> 00:11:18,450
... are all dead.

95
00:11:21,592 --> 00:11:23,827
What is he talking about?
Who is Pinky?

96
00:11:26,574 --> 00:11:28,061
If it helps us,

97
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,708
not only let you live, how you
take for a safe place.

98
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:33,675
What? No, it was not
part of the agreement.

99
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,464
I can not.

100
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:45,175
I was hoping you said that.

101
00:11:49,234 --> 00:11:51,825
Tell them and ready, Gage.
Please tell them.

102
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:54,075
Okay, okay.

103
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:57,215
Piece of shit.

104
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:02,798
Are there.

105
00:12:03,353 --> 00:12:05,887
The 15 steps east of the van.

106
00:12:07,585 --> 00:12:10,532
Trixie, get those blades
alongside the caravan.

107
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:13,847
Camero, is over time.
Covers her mouth and put it in the car.

108
00:12:13,848 --> 00:12:16,797
- What? Let's not even ...?
- Who knows if you are lying?

109
00:12:17,173 --> 00:12:19,179
If they come trouble,
we need something to negotiate.

110
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,670
- This is bullshit.
- Do it and go!

111
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:36,935
You receive orders rather than
a young boy in Bangkok.

112
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:39,121
Shut your fucking mouth.

113
00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:42,210
You can have an agreement with her,
but do not have one with me.

114
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:45,177
Who are they?

115
00:12:45,893 --> 00:12:48,355
Puppets
to get what I want.

116
00:12:49,498 --> 00:12:51,501
How do you know you can trust them?

117
00:12:52,092 --> 00:12:54,946
Especially that.
The fucking stripper.

118
00:12:55,298 --> 00:12:57,630
It is dangerous.
You put yourself to stick with it.

119
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,119
Will you stop moving.

120
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,362
Do not turn your back on this crazy!

121
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:10,764
She will betray you. As did
with others in the Glory Hole!

122
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:13,698
What is he talking about?

123
00:13:14,005 --> 00:13:15,521
They do not know, do you?

124
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:22,050
- You were the Glory Hole?
- Was, yes indeed.

125
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:24,485
It was a Camero that killed Liberty e. ..

126
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,222
Bye-bye, Dick Mole.

127
00:13:36,318 --> 00:13:38,826
4 HOURS 3 MINUTES BEFORE and

128
00:14:10,489 --> 00:14:12,156
CAN NOT SEE!
WHAT?

129
00:14:24,026 --> 00:14:25,670
I love Home Depot.

130
00:14:25,954 --> 00:14:28,409
Now, listen, your bitch.

131
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,422
I have a reputation
to be very persuasive.

132
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,505
And I know that thou art virtuous
with those neck muscles.

133
00:14:35,606 --> 00:14:37,430
So it's good you start to talk ...

134
00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:41,000
... or shove it up for your cousin above.

135
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,880
You passed up?
This was not part of the plan.

136
00:15:05,881 --> 00:15:08,809
- Perhaps not part of your plan.
- You told me that nobody would hurt.

137
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,149
- You promised me!
- I know, Trixie. I know.

138
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,156
We could not keep Gage alive.
He was dangerous.

139
00:15:13,157 --> 00:15:16,672
No! I said right at the outset:
we did not kill anyone!

140
00:15:16,673 --> 00:15:19,939
Now all we have is a corpse
leading to Pinky. And nothing in his hands.

141
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,083
- My God, will hold us forever.
- Shut up, Raw Machado.

142
00:15:23,084 --> 00:15:24,278
Shut up.

143
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:26,325
- What did you say?
- Back, Camero.

144
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:29,085
No, why not let the Cleavage of
Ravine defend itself?

145
00:15:29,086 --> 00:15:31,100
What did you mean with the Gage
"Also you will betray us"?

146
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:32,255
You are fucking up the court, Hel.

147
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:33,804
And why not say that
been in the Glory Hole?

148
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,187
And why did not you tell me
you knew the Gage?

149
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:36,808
Why not know.
He was lying.

150
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,300
Exactly.

151
00:15:38,628 --> 00:15:41,698
It was this same person-Drawn fucks
conspirator was trying to do.

152
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:43,347
What we turned in
against each other.

153
00:15:43,348 --> 00:15:45,892
He is a master manipulator, Hel.

154
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,374
Also,
told us where is the material.

155
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:51,625
Where is hope!
He could be trying to gain time.

156
00:15:51,946 --> 00:15:53,750
He trusted me ...

157
00:15:54,398 --> 00:15:56,013
... and now is dead.

158
00:15:57,367 --> 00:16:00,760
6 HOURS BEFORE

159
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,311
Yes, it's great.

160
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,380
That's right.
Shows what you have there.

161
00:16:20,016 --> 00:16:22,967
- You like that?
- Yes, Daddy likes.

162
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:25,241
Then try this.

163
00:16:29,469 --> 00:16:30,664
Goddamn.

164
00:16:30,765 --> 00:16:32,896
I call this movement
"Shock and Awe".

165
00:16:35,547 --> 00:16:38,705
Never felt so
for a girl.

166
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:43,325
You are so cute.

167
00:16:43,787 --> 00:16:45,766
And you are decent and pure,

168
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:47,558
and I love you.

169
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,693
Now, because
to put them together,

170
00:16:49,694 --> 00:16:52,869
we are beautiful somersaults,
and treat such clams your thirsty?

171
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,328
Drink to that.

172
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,996
Damn.

173
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:09,520
Have got to be strong and
you concentres, Trixie.

174
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:12,856
Remember why we are here.
All we need it.

175
00:17:13,635 --> 00:17:15,310
Especially you ...

176
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:18,669
What is this?

177
00:17:22,223 --> 00:17:23,902
Comes from Gage.

178
00:17:37,028 --> 00:17:39,163
Indicative of the Los Angeles area.

179
00:17:39,718 --> 00:17:41,969
I thought I told you
for you search the pockets.

180
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,124
- What is stress? Serves.
- Stress?

181
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,444
With the right equipment,
anyone finds this phone.

182
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:49,776
If this is the Pinky,
or some of the men Gage

183
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,687
they now know it and we
are even here.

184
00:17:52,688 --> 00:17:53,829
My God ...

185
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:57,280
See? This is what happens
when you do not do what you're told.

186
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:01,353
Fuck you, Hel! I reviewed it.
He had no phone when we left.

187
00:18:01,354 --> 00:18:03,984
- Obviously had.
- Are you calling me a liar?

188
00:18:03,985 --> 00:18:07,141
- I'm calling you careless.
- Stop! Both!

189
00:18:08,105 --> 00:18:09,746
What do we do now?

190
00:18:10,197 --> 00:18:11,695
I know what I'll do.

191
00:18:14,445 --> 00:18:17,387
Relax, Hel!
That call did not mean anything.

192
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:21,531
It was probably one of his whores
used to want to be leased for a while.

193
00:18:21,532 --> 00:18:23,099
We can not risk it.

194
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:26,728
We find that
come and get out of here. Fast!

195
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:30,460
For me, fine. Sooner
blow up with this hole, the better.

196
00:18:31,955 --> 00:18:33,650
And Gage?

197
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:35,978
Leave it for now.

198
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:38,349
Bury him when we're done.

199
00:18:41,677 --> 00:18:43,843
This was supposed to have been easy.

200
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,470
So ...

201
00:18:57,683 --> 00:18:59,771
... who is this Pinky?

202
00:19:02,495 --> 00:19:03,506
Guys?

203
00:19:04,122 --> 00:19:06,649
The Pinky is a personality
famous underworld.

204
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,173
It sells drugs, weapons,
smuggling industrial ...

205
00:19:10,587 --> 00:19:13,354
Organizes groups of killers
fleets of counterfeit material ...

206
00:19:13,355 --> 00:19:15,325
The rumor that has contracts
governmental murder

207
00:19:15,335 --> 00:19:17,120
and arms to terrorist cells.

208
00:19:17,121 --> 00:19:20,657
Nobody talks to Pinky directly.
And no one even knows how it is.

209
00:19:20,658 --> 00:19:22,696
Many believe
that Pinky is a ghost.

210
00:19:22,931 --> 00:19:25,638
Others think
who sold his soul to the devil.

211
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:27,722
I think he is the devil.

212
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,639
Come ...
They're just trying to scare me.

213
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,575
Listen there, Entesoada,

214
00:19:32,776 --> 00:19:37,511
've seen their victims hanging
hooks and open as lambs,

215
00:19:37,512 --> 00:19:40,498
holding his bowels in his hands
and plead for death.

216
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,772
A few years ago ...

217
00:19:43,773 --> 00:19:47,730
called a Russian oligarch
Vladimir 'The Butcher' Popmeov

218
00:19:47,731 --> 00:19:51,171
was behind with Pinky
50 of his best assassins.

219
00:19:52,103 --> 00:19:54,646
The Pinky come that
shit storm armed only

220
00:19:54,681 --> 00:19:56,518
with a sword old and dusty.

221
00:19:57,264 --> 00:19:58,457
When finished ...

222
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:01,715
... the only thing that remained was
a lot of 5 meters

223
00:20:01,716 --> 00:20:05,229
dismembered bodies
and the head of Popmeov

224
00:20:05,264 --> 00:20:09,120
stuck on top as the
shooting star of the Christmas tree.

225
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:13,300
No single fret on the street
I die not afraid of him.

226
00:20:13,401 --> 00:20:15,523
And now this guy walks behind us?

227
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:19,007
Crap.

228
00:20:20,538 --> 00:20:23,507
3 NIGHTS BEFORE

229
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:30,478
My God is so good!
Power, baby.

230
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,370
Get off me.
Gotta go.

231
00:20:49,397 --> 00:20:50,608
Where is the key, Black Ice?

232
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:52,987
Fuck you, Mamalhuda.
Not have.

233
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,526
Fuck up, bitch!
Give me the stick.

234
00:21:26,307 --> 00:21:29,065
Darling,
want to go to the back of your life?

235
00:22:23,152 --> 00:22:24,238
What?

236
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,535
Nothing.

237
00:22:32,757 --> 00:22:34,114
Fuck.

238
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:40,007
The Gage!

239
00:22:44,714 --> 00:22:47,957
Let's put him in the trunk.
Trixie, slap the blood.

240
00:22:51,865 --> 00:22:52,927
Come!

241
00:23:04,001 --> 00:23:05,363
This is crazy!

242
00:23:05,364 --> 00:23:07,249
Let's tell the truth
and end this!

243
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,140
Do not say a word!
No way I go back to prison.

244
00:23:10,141 --> 00:23:12,063
- If you have to do, kill him.
- No!

245
00:23:12,098 --> 00:23:14,456
Shut up and the two
let me be me talking.

246
00:23:42,376 --> 00:23:43,497
Ladies ...

247
00:23:44,163 --> 00:23:45,774
... it's all right here?

248
00:23:45,975 --> 00:23:48,372
We are so glad to see him ...

249
00:23:48,373 --> 00:23:50,753
I saw that the fence was down,
the highway.

250
00:23:50,754 --> 00:23:52,390
You should not be here.

251
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:54,562
The government used
here to test atomic bombs.

252
00:23:54,663 --> 00:23:56,975
If you stay too long
you grow a third eye.

253
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:05,436
Anyway, how
ladies get here?

254
00:24:06,246 --> 00:24:09,966
Well, Officer,
is quite a story.

255
00:24:11,778 --> 00:24:13,201
I have to my sisters

256
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:16,978
are part of the Choir of Virgins
Holy St. Ave, Arizona.

257
00:24:17,342 --> 00:24:20,222
Supposedly we
have come today to sing in Mojave.

258
00:24:20,678 --> 00:24:23,493
Since we were so far from home,
the director of the local parish suggested

259
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:26,183
who kindly slept here.

260
00:24:26,353 --> 00:24:31,429
Well, when we were all
aconchegadinhas our bed only.

261
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:34,103
We heard loud music and laughter
coming from outside.

262
00:24:34,204 --> 00:24:37,833
Look outside and saw
all members of the parish

263
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:40,311
dancing and laughing ...

264
00:24:40,489 --> 00:24:42,881
and smoking something
did not seem to be smoking.

265
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:45,035
They tried to caress our boobs.

266
00:24:45,174 --> 00:24:48,539
And yet convinced Bambi Lynn
Hosts of the fire inside ...

267
00:24:49,686 --> 00:24:53,112
Ahead. We went out there and fled to the
our car, but they chased us.

268
00:24:53,113 --> 00:24:55,722
Thank God that the Cheyenne
know how to drive and Bambi Lynn knows how to turn,

269
00:24:55,723 --> 00:24:57,460
because we lose them.

270
00:24:58,001 --> 00:25:00,410
But then
were three in the morning ...

271
00:25:00,784 --> 00:25:03,580
was dark ...
and we were scared.

272
00:25:03,718 --> 00:25:06,074
And someone is not very good
following statements.

273
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:09,606
And, well ...
we finally get here.

274
00:25:09,894 --> 00:25:12,307
And now
der to believe it ...

275
00:25:12,654 --> 00:25:14,492
... our car died.

276
00:25:20,403 --> 00:25:21,450
I see.

277
00:25:22,372 --> 00:25:24,439
We tried to put it to work but ...

278
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,513
... can not.

279
00:25:27,103 --> 00:25:30,581
That is why we
all dirty and desperate.

280
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:33,799
- You must think the worst of us.
- No.

281
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,712
Do not be silly.

282
00:25:36,094 --> 00:25:39,785
Already called the trailer
and are way, officer ...

283
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,271
... Fuchs.

284
00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:46,279
Fuchs. Is a ...

285
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:48,912
Fuchs, ma'am.

286
00:25:52,688 --> 00:25:54,435
You know, let me take a look.

287
00:25:54,455 --> 00:25:56,955
Sometimes, you just have to know
manage these old beauties.

288
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:58,550
This will not be necessary.

289
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,146
Why not?

290
00:26:00,968 --> 00:26:02,513
What happened to your hand?

291
00:26:07,349 --> 00:26:09,148
I cut myself on my crucifix.

292
00:26:10,112 --> 00:26:11,147
You know what?

293
00:26:11,348 --> 00:26:16,051
The company already in the trailer
charged $ 200 to come here.

294
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:17,727
They said they would arrive
around noon.

295
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,930
Maybe you can save that money.

296
00:26:32,433 --> 00:26:34,210
I no longer do so.

297
00:26:34,411 --> 00:26:37,357
Today it is only
computers and sensors ...

298
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,825
You have to work for
NASA just to change the oil.

299
00:26:55,605 --> 00:26:57,337
Well, can give the key?

300
00:27:06,905 --> 00:27:09,008
See? Nothing.

301
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:11,999
This is strange.
It should be a start.

302
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,403
You know what?

303
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,686
Sometimes, these old cars come with a
toolbox beyond the monkey.

304
00:27:40,846 --> 00:27:41,865
You can not!

305
00:27:43,601 --> 00:27:44,720
You can not!

306
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:47,695
Why not?

307
00:27:47,882 --> 00:27:51,491
- Because ...
- Because the lock is rusted.

308
00:27:51,492 --> 00:27:53,243
Not open for years.

309
00:27:58,948 --> 00:28:02,051
- She is right?
- It will be great.

310
00:28:02,352 --> 00:28:04,166
Still troubled
with last night.

311
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:06,826
That boys choir
tried to rape her.

312
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:08,984
Listen ...

313
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,642
... you have been so helpful and kind.

314
00:28:11,743 --> 00:28:14,604
The least I can do
is back and cook for you.

315
00:28:14,705 --> 00:28:16,967
Let ... dinner on Friday?

316
00:28:21,803 --> 00:28:24,348
It's a tempting offer but ...

317
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:26,272
... do so ...

318
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,767
... pass by here later
to make sure that the ladies

319
00:28:29,768 --> 00:28:31,266
departed safely.

320
00:28:32,847 --> 00:28:34,225
Have a nice day.

321
00:28:51,551 --> 00:28:53,629
I bet you are
Bury us now.

322
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:57,441
We should have told you.
It seemed like a nice guy.

323
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,912
He did not suspect a thing.

324
00:29:14,938 --> 00:29:17,352
5 NIGHTS BEFORE

325
00:29:18,087 --> 00:29:21,764
DEPARTMENT
Homeland Security

326
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,578
Who wants to enter the
my doors of Paradise?

327
00:30:13,974 --> 00:30:15,470
I! I want!

328
00:30:15,477 --> 00:30:16,913
I am a priest!

329
00:30:19,711 --> 00:30:20,833
Disappear.

330
00:31:02,553 --> 00:31:03,896
I am in Trixie.

331
00:31:03,997 --> 00:31:06,320
Your piece of Paradise.

332
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:10,754
I'm in love.

333
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:12,377
Good girl.

334
00:31:43,378 --> 00:31:45,825
- You know, I was thinking.
- Oh, dear.

335
00:31:45,926 --> 00:31:49,685
Is stealing from a criminal
is better than being a criminal?

336
00:31:51,104 --> 00:31:53,227
I have a better for you, Princess.

337
00:31:53,528 --> 00:31:56,906
What was the site most extravagant
where have you had sex?

338
00:31:57,591 --> 00:31:59,254
Why do you want to know?

339
00:31:59,355 --> 00:32:02,520
Curiosity only.
It says much for a woman.

340
00:32:04,253 --> 00:32:08,143
Or was sex in the stands at three
Shock agricultural fair,

341
00:32:08,144 --> 00:32:12,678
or on top of a horse-drawn wagon
Amish land with Stelf Jakey.

342
00:32:13,388 --> 00:32:14,462
Hel?

343
00:32:15,962 --> 00:32:18,743
How about less verbiage and more digging?

344
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:22,796
Let me start this
your secrets one day, Hel.

345
00:32:22,797 --> 00:32:24,548
I have no secrets.

346
00:32:26,977 --> 00:32:28,813
What about you, Camero?

347
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:32,680
My best fuck
was a contortionist,

348
00:32:32,681 --> 00:32:35,938
behind the tent show
aberrations at Circo Nudieus.

349
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:38,756
I could not straighten
for days.

350
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:41,004
I never asked her name.

351
00:32:50,521 --> 00:32:52,923
7 NIGHTS BEFORE

352
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:16,897
Good night, Hot Wire.

353
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,809
Did not see your filthy pillowcase
from the Glory Hole.

354
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,297
I was just following orders, Camero.

355
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:29,517
Without ofen ...

356
00:33:30,268 --> 00:33:33,264
Murf! Crap! Pino! Mijo!
... sa, okay?

357
00:33:33,453 --> 00:33:34,873
Where's Gage?

358
00:33:37,961 --> 00:33:39,157
I do not know.

359
00:33:42,971 --> 00:33:45,659
I have no time to be
Dry fucked tonight.

360
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,573
Honey, I'm undefeated here.

361
00:34:19,574 --> 00:34:20,736
Okay, okay.

362
00:34:20,837 --> 00:34:23,360
The Gage organized another
bash chicks hot babes.

363
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,536
This Friday. At midnight.

364
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:51,221
The temperature continues to rise.

365
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:53,510
No longer take it anymore!

366
00:35:10,031 --> 00:35:11,567
Do not waste all a. ..

367
00:35:12,603 --> 00:35:15,242
Grab me in the balls
and call me Sally.

368
00:35:17,637 --> 00:35:19,471
You might want to cover up.

369
00:35:20,942 --> 00:35:22,223
What?

370
00:35:23,323 --> 00:35:26,225
Do not tell me they do not want
rather than have to sell.

371
00:35:27,312 --> 00:35:29,874
I'll put up all wet.

372
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,871
Stop these games, Trixie.
I'm serious.

373
00:35:34,767 --> 00:35:35,809
Goat shit.

374
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,147
Not think about it.

375
00:36:05,338 --> 00:36:07,368
His goats are dead!

376
00:36:44,254 --> 00:36:47,031
10 DAYS BEFORE

377
00:36:59,189 --> 00:37:01,403
Satellite data
communications coincide.

378
00:37:04,281 --> 00:37:06,203
"Goats Voluptuous
American Graduate Feminist "

379
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:14,768
The Gage must
a sick sense of humor.

380
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:16,460
And a desire to die.

381
00:37:17,957 --> 00:37:20,543
- The girl suspected of something?
- No, Phoenix.

382
00:37:20,544 --> 00:37:23,394
Everything is going as planned.
Mobilize operating.

383
00:37:23,395 --> 00:37:24,966
Hence the five days went into action.

384
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:27,549
The nanoswarm is active
and there will be lots of victims ..

385
00:37:29,822 --> 00:37:31,853
Time to go.
We were located.

386
00:37:45,825 --> 00:37:46,920
You okay?

387
00:37:46,921 --> 00:37:48,714
Is something
to bite me rabiosque.

388
00:37:51,231 --> 00:37:52,350
What is this?

389
00:37:55,217 --> 00:37:56,340
Help me to dig.

390
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,722
I think it is.

391
00:38:08,729 --> 00:38:11,322
Hooray for us.
We are the greatest!

392
00:38:17,015 --> 00:38:18,043
God!

393
00:38:23,104 --> 00:38:25,273
It seems that is not here
long.

394
00:38:25,374 --> 00:38:26,994
Maybe a few weeks.

395
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:30,995
No one I know.
Poor fellow.

396
00:38:31,327 --> 00:38:32,906
Did not die quickly.

397
00:38:33,381 --> 00:38:35,579
Someone was
trying to get information.

398
00:38:36,043 --> 00:38:37,233
The Gage?

399
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:41,221
No. He was dark,
but not so dark.

400
00:38:41,954 --> 00:38:44,646
There is only one person
that would make this kind of thing.

401
00:38:58,344 --> 00:38:59,885
We are being observed?

402
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:03,349
This is crazy! Now I come!

403
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,531
- I want to go home!
- Calm down, Trix.

404
00:39:05,532 --> 00:39:09,853
Calm down? All I know say that, Hel,
but people continue to die!

405
00:39:09,854 --> 00:39:11,983
I can not end up like him.

406
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:19,430
- We are running out of time.
- Your friend is going on.

407
00:39:19,431 --> 00:39:21,877
- She will be fine.
- I'm not stuck because of it.

408
00:39:21,888 --> 00:39:23,590
I said that it will be fine.

409
00:39:24,365 --> 00:39:25,796
Scan the perimeter.

410
00:39:37,204 --> 00:39:38,950
Sorry, Hel.

411
00:39:39,676 --> 00:39:41,589
I thought I could do this.

412
00:39:42,366 --> 00:39:44,272
I thought I could be strong.

413
00:39:44,742 --> 00:39:48,099
No, Trixie ...
I disappoint you.

414
00:39:49,312 --> 00:39:51,843
I shouldn 't
have sought to do this.

415
00:39:53,969 --> 00:39:55,782
Do not force me.

416
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:58,544
I wanted to be here ...

417
00:39:59,143 --> 00:40:00,706
... with you.

418
00:40:09,725 --> 00:40:14,314
You're the first person in all
my life who believed in me.

419
00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:25,525
We should not.

420
00:40:27,562 --> 00:40:29,088
Not here.

421
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,187
Please ...

422
00:40:33,171 --> 00:40:34,918
... I need you.

423
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:38,981
I never felt this before ...

424
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,252
... for anyone.

425
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,155
So why do not you kiss me ...

426
00:40:48,662 --> 00:40:50,061
... now?

427
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,633
What the fuck!

428
00:43:00,893 --> 00:43:02,036
Camero ...

429
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:03,411
... I can explain.

430
00:43:04,421 --> 00:43:09,042
I'm out there to pull the leather and
you are here to give a loose to?

431
00:43:09,344 --> 00:43:12,249
And Gage was right.
I can not trust you.

432
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,957
- You can, yes.
- Lies!

433
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:15,709
What else are not telling me?

434
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:18,537
- They plan to get rid of me too?
- Do not be ridiculous.

435
00:43:18,538 --> 00:43:21,600
- Who is being ridiculous, Hel?
- It's my fault, Camero.

436
00:43:21,601 --> 00:43:23,232
Hel I asked not to tell.

437
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,459
Did you know you gonna come along and
make you even more uncontrollable.

438
00:43:27,381 --> 00:43:29,143
So I need to be controlled?

439
00:43:29,995 --> 00:43:32,546
- Is that what you think? It?
- No!

440
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:36,296
Why not I who is exploring
the depths of delicious sprout

441
00:43:36,316 --> 00:43:38,462
to pretend I'm something I'm not.

442
00:43:39,545 --> 00:43:41,271
I knew it davas trouble.

443
00:43:41,971 --> 00:43:43,442
Never should have left
Hel to bring up.

444
00:43:43,443 --> 00:43:46,239
We would not have found
this place without her, remember?

445
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,453
Truth.
So now we can kill it.

446
00:43:50,344 --> 00:43:52,546
Kill her and you must
I kill me too.

447
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:55,768
And then you will not have anyone to sell
the material or treat contacts.

448
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:57,363
That's what you want?

449
00:43:58,776 --> 00:44:00,507
Sorry, Camero.

450
00:44:01,517 --> 00:44:04,154
Should have told you
on us from the beginning.

451
00:44:04,255 --> 00:44:07,140
But I never thought
to betray you in this business.

452
00:44:07,558 --> 00:44:09,129
We're all in this ...

453
00:44:09,444 --> 00:44:10,918
... until the end.

454
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:13,634
Or won all,
or lose all ...

455
00:44:13,935 --> 00:44:17,273
... and now lose
has a price too high.

456
00:44:30,344 --> 00:44:33,015
Mind again and killed the two.

457
00:44:57,247 --> 00:44:59,869
Excuse
it was my fault.

458
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:02,330
I could not control.

459
00:45:02,431 --> 00:45:05,039
Never apologize parts
for being you own.

460
00:45:06,116 --> 00:45:08,198
It scares me, Hel.

461
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:10,812
Are you sure that she
will not try anything?

462
00:45:10,813 --> 00:45:14,066
With the Camero is not quite clear.
Help me up, okay?

463
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,343
It seems that the Gage
was prepared for war.

464
00:45:30,344 --> 00:45:33,153
Camero!
Come on, we have found something.

465
00:45:36,789 --> 00:45:39,143
K-14, a pirate with spool gun.

466
00:45:39,144 --> 00:45:42,835
Based carbon fiber,
system soundproof hellfire ...

467
00:45:43,036 --> 00:45:45,236
... a laser aiming zion.

468
00:45:45,614 --> 00:45:50,176
This is really a
powerful secret weapon.

469
00:45:52,153 --> 00:45:54,190
How do you know all this?

470
00:45:55,847 --> 00:45:59,562
My father was part of ghost
recognition of the CIA in the 80s.

471
00:46:01,663 --> 00:46:03,241
Camero, you hear me?

472
00:46:14,847 --> 00:46:16,525
Where was she?

473
00:46:17,264 --> 00:46:18,713
Camero!

474
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:21,117
Where are you?

475
00:46:33,444 --> 00:46:35,178
Trixie, enter the car, quick!

476
00:46:35,754 --> 00:46:37,821
'Okay, well, bitches!

477
00:46:50,835 --> 00:46:54,895
You're not kidding, Kinki.
Looks like a jam chicks.

478
00:46:55,444 --> 00:46:58,527
- Who the hell are you?
- Think of us as ...

479
00:47:02,261 --> 00:47:05,318
... debt collectors.
Rata, boat, perfect!

480
00:47:59,517 --> 00:48:01,931
Naughty ...

481
00:48:02,317 --> 00:48:04,300
Kinki slapping.

482
00:48:07,534 --> 00:48:09,568
Relax!
Relax. You okay.

483
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:19,459
It seems that this time we are
Would you have the tomatoes, Camero.

484
00:48:20,816 --> 00:48:22,220
You know these two?

485
00:48:22,221 --> 00:48:26,268
When she came in search of Gage
I quickly noticed that something was going to spend big.

486
00:48:26,269 --> 00:48:28,610
He bought me a long time,
cheater!

487
00:48:28,633 --> 00:48:30,358
We have been following you.

488
00:48:31,776 --> 00:48:32,787
So ...

489
00:48:34,722 --> 00:48:37,304
... the legendary treasure of the Gage
existent.

490
00:48:37,702 --> 00:48:39,076
Where is it?

491
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,514
- We do not know.
- Do not try to cheat.

492
00:48:41,549 --> 00:48:44,849
No way to say 2 times the Kinki ...
Should be allowed! Twinkie perfect!

493
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:46,500
... you get to face.

494
00:48:46,643 --> 00:48:49,917
The Gage lied to us.
It is buried where he said.

495
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,730
So it is better to continue to dig.

496
00:48:54,966 --> 00:48:58,814
That fuck. I will not dig
anything for you unless your grave.

497
00:49:00,169 --> 00:49:01,331
Enough!

498
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:04,396
Let's dig.
But let her alone.

499
00:49:07,836 --> 00:49:11,611
I like to leave you hit
seven shades of shit out of you two!

500
00:49:19,964 --> 00:49:22,083
You still ...
The lodge of my old Barney!

501
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,979
Camero ... the same as always.

502
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,720
Now start digging.

503
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:32,885
I want to ...

504
00:49:33,986 --> 00:49:35,764
Not you, honey.

505
00:49:36,364 --> 00:49:38,731
You stay here.

506
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:44,057
Do what he says.

507
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:55,799
The Kinki likes you.

508
00:49:56,823 --> 00:50:00,030
The Kinki want to play ...

509
00:50:06,441 --> 00:50:08,363
She wants to play what?

510
00:50:13,771 --> 00:50:16,345
7 WEEKS BEFORE

511
00:50:33,726 --> 00:50:35,833
I need help to get out of here.

512
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,466
I miss you, Camero.

513
00:50:40,567 --> 00:50:43,386
Certain animals
my stay in prison.

514
00:50:43,746 --> 00:50:46,707
Recluse 1138, get ready
for processing.

515
00:50:47,367 --> 00:50:49,880
It's safe. Open the cell 2187.

516
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:51,432
But ...

517
00:50:51,709 --> 00:50:52,963
I told you,

518
00:50:53,112 --> 00:50:54,835
I can still get you out.

519
00:50:54,936 --> 00:50:57,001
But you must give me something in return.

520
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:01,453
Eat your favorite food, Camero.

521
00:51:02,887 --> 00:51:04,124
Well, come on.

522
00:51:12,496 --> 00:51:13,796
Can I trust you?

523
00:51:14,384 --> 00:51:15,583
Of course.

524
00:51:15,584 --> 00:51:19,609
Take me out and divided
200 million in diamonds you.

525
00:51:30,197 --> 00:51:31,248
Arre!

526
00:51:31,449 --> 00:51:34,230
Dammit.
Come on, faster.

527
00:51:34,331 --> 00:51:37,199
You are my horse.
Come on, faster.

528
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,305
Ride him, Kinki!

529
00:51:42,913 --> 00:51:45,579
Dammit.
Come on, faster.

530
00:51:52,954 --> 00:51:55,408
This show is private.
Back to work!

531
00:52:01,467 --> 00:52:03,793
If I make a diversion
and run to the arms

532
00:52:04,078 --> 00:52:06,243
think you can get to Trixie?

533
00:52:11,848 --> 00:52:14,067
What, now not talking to me?

534
00:52:15,596 --> 00:52:18,824
- Come on, Camero, I need you.
- To save Mrs. Boca Magic?

535
00:52:18,825 --> 00:52:20,089
No way.

536
00:52:21,042 --> 00:52:22,392
You took something?

537
00:52:23,244 --> 00:52:25,202
I no longer know who you are!

538
00:52:25,203 --> 00:52:29,366
I never should have trusted you.
Certainly not me should have love.

539
00:52:45,739 --> 00:52:46,926
That's it.

540
00:52:48,205 --> 00:52:49,223
Get up.

541
00:52:50,704 --> 00:52:51,746
Get up.

542
00:52:58,332 --> 00:52:59,763
Forget it.

543
00:52:59,954 --> 00:53:03,004
We can do this.
It's just us now.

544
00:53:04,784 --> 00:53:07,599
No! No!
Stop! Help me!

545
00:53:10,213 --> 00:53:12,252
Found something!

546
00:53:13,942 --> 00:53:15,983
Garlic! Orgia solo!

547
00:53:19,088 --> 00:53:21,068
Move. Come on, Cu Raso.

548
00:53:24,345 --> 00:53:25,435
Clears it!

549
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,359
Clears it!

550
00:53:37,671 --> 00:53:38,711
Open it.

551
00:53:39,002 --> 00:53:40,333
I said to open!

552
00:53:40,334 --> 00:53:43,747
Knees, Mamas Floridas!
It is the only place where you are good!

553
00:53:49,796 --> 00:53:50,887
Open it!

554
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:02,361
Perhaps there is some kind of code.

555
00:54:02,362 --> 00:54:03,587
And who knows o. ..

556
00:54:04,409 --> 00:54:06,630
Plums when they are cooked!
... code?

557
00:54:07,929 --> 00:54:09,043
Who knows?

558
00:54:10,782 --> 00:54:11,861
Nobody?

559
00:54:17,107 --> 00:54:20,195
The Kinki is right. If no one speaks,
there is no reason to keep you alive.

560
00:54:20,396 --> 00:54:21,413
Wait!

561
00:54:21,949 --> 00:54:23,160
Let me try.

562
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,604
Let me try.

563
00:54:26,605 --> 00:54:28,050
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

564
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:30,266
- Hurry up! Hurry!
- Okay.
