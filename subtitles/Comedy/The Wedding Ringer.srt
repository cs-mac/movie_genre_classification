1
00:00:05,173 --> 00:00:06,591
Hello.
Hi. Seth?

2
00:00:06,675 --> 00:00:08,134
Yeah?
Hey, there, it's Doug.

3
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:09,260
Um, I'm sorry.
Doug who?

4
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:13,932
Doug Harris.
You know, Doug Harris.

5
00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:17,352
"Persian Rug Doug"?
"Chili Cheese Doug"?

6
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:19,145
"SPF 60"?

7
00:00:19,229 --> 00:00:21,022
Oh, of course, man.

8
00:00:21,106 --> 00:00:22,857
SPF 60,
how are you, brother?

9
00:00:22,941 --> 00:00:24,317
It's been a long time.

10
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:26,111
I, uh, know we haven't
spoken in a while

11
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:28,363
but I was actually
calling because

12
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:30,365
I've actually got
some really great news.

13
00:00:31,116 --> 00:00:34,411
I'm getting married, bud. Wow!
That's amazing. Congratulations.

14
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:37,288
We're very excited and, in
fact, I'm doubly excited

15
00:00:37,372 --> 00:00:39,207
because I'm calling
to see if maybe

16
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,918
you would want
to be my best man.

17
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:48,717
<i>Wow. Um, I mean,
this is</i> a <i>little bit awkward.</i>

18
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:51,594
I feel like
we're not at that level.

19
00:00:51,678 --> 00:00:53,998
It feels like we don't know
each other that well. You know?

20
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:57,767
No, I don't feel that way.
What about that...

21
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:00,395
Seth, what about that
weekend in Carlsbad Caverns?

22
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:02,397
<i>I mean, that was
the 9th grade field trip.</i>

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,606
The whole class went.

24
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,108
Can I give you the dates?

25
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:07,902
Maybe you just want to look into it.

26
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:09,026
Are you still there, Seth?

27
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:10,155
I don't know
what to say, Doug.

28
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:11,656
<i>I mean, I didn't
invite you to my wedding.</i>

29
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,492
That's okay. That's okay.

30
00:01:14,576 --> 00:01:17,036
Yeah, you can't invite
everyone that you want to.

31
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,539
Actually, we did invite
everyone we wanted to.

32
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:21,458
We had,
like, 400 guests.

33
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:24,294
Freshman year?
Your roommate?

34
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:26,880
<i>I heard you died.</i>

35
00:01:26,963 --> 00:01:30,967
No. No, that's Len Brophy.
I'm the other one.

36
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,762
Truth be told, uh, you're the
first person I thought of.

37
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:34,971
Is that a yes or a no?

38
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:36,347

I ain't lying.

93
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:52,859
Yeah. I've always been a bit
of a hopeless romantic myself.

94
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:55,153
If our true match
exists somewhere,

95
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,322
it's our goal in life
to find her.

96
00:03:57,655 --> 00:04:00,074
But, see, Andrew's a bit
more rational than me.

97
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:02,577
Andrew always believed
that "the one"

98
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,830
was a farce created
by musicians and Hollywood.

99
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:08,166
Until last December.

100
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,835
Andrew calls my cell phone
and he says,

101
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,128
"Remember all that
stuff I said about"

102
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,923
"there being no such
thing as 'the one'?"

103
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:17,717
He said, "Well, I was wrong.
Her name is Gina Baker."

104
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,093
"And she doesn't
know this yet,"

105
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:20,678
"but she's going
to be my wife."

106
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:21,804
Aw.

107
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:23,681
And I knew at that moment

108
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:25,224
that this Gina Baker

109
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:27,018
was the luckiest girl
in the world.

110
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,896
But after getting to know
you these past few days,

111
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:32,482
and as I look at
you tonight, Gina,

112
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:33,733
I know at this moment

113
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:37,737
that Andrew is the
luckiest guy in the world.

114
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,990
Because I know that you
both have found "the one."

115
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:42,367
Aw.

116
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:45,912
Ah. I said I'm not going to do it.

117
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:49,123
I want to propose a toast.

118
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,960
This is to the groom,

119
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:55,713
my best friend,

120
00:04:57,048 --> 00:04:59,050
and his beautiful
new bride.

121
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:00,927
This is to
"happily ever after."

122
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,637
- I love you both.
- Cheers!

123
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:08,142
- Congrats, man.
- Great speech.

124
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:09,978
So, are you still
the hopeless romantic?

125
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:11,854
Well, I wouldn't say
"hopeless."

126
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:17,110
Hey, can I speak to you for a minute?
Like, two seconds.

127
00:05:17,193 --> 00:05:19,320
Yeah. Uh, I'll be
fightback, babe.

128
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:23,574
I don't even
know what to say, man.

129
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:25,868
Did you see their faces?
They were smiling.

130
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:27,495
Hey, hey!

131
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:29,455
Man, did you see the beautiful
titties on that girl back there?

132
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,208
I'm trying to tag her ass before she
passes out, so if you could just...

133
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,420
Yeah, sure. Um, your
wig's a little askew.

134
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:38,006
That's fine. Thank you. Okay.
So, I guess that's it.

135
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:39,757
You know the rules.
I do. I just thought that...

136
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:42,260
Thought what? I thought we
maybe hit it off, right?

137
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,762
No. We definitely didn't.
Oh.

138

unfortunately, a deal is a deal.

140
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:49,559
I should have
charged you more.

141
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:51,352
I'm serious, man. You got
the real deal tonight.

142

I was in the zone, baby.

143
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:54,272
Yeah, great.
No, we don't do that.

144
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,940
Sure.
Thank you, man.

00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:37,106
enhanced in
a smoky-silver tone.

161
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,317
Does anyone else feel really
fucking gay right now?

162
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,569
Ed! Let's go with the Très Beau.

163
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:44,447
Trés Beau tussie-mussie
is fabulous.

164
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,658
Christ, somebody just shoot me.
I'll be outside.

165
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:50,062
All right, team, can
we all gather around, please?

166
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,331
Okay. I have everything
I need for the bridesmaids,

167
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:58,419
but I am still missing
the groomsmen's information.

168
00:06:58,503 --> 00:07:01,214
What? Honey, you told me you
spoke to all the groomsmen.

169
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:03,216
See,
I sent them an email,

170
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:04,967
but you know how guys are.

171
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:07,136
They just haven't
responded yet.

172
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,471
Babe, I know
you've been really busy,

173
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:10,348
but our wedding
is in 10 days.

174
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,474
I mean,
can't your best man

175
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:12,642
help you with
all of this?

176
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:17,063
Uh, but you see,
Bic's still in El Salvador.

177
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,732
Well, let's hope he's in LA next week.

178
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:21,359
Oh, he will be.
Mom.

179
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:23,611
He'll be there.

180
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:26,781
Okay, look, why don't I
just contact Mr. Rambis,

181
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:29,951
Mr. Garvey, Mr. Plunkett,
Mr. Carew,

182
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:33,538
Mr. Drysdale, Mr. Alzado,
Mr. Dickerson?

183
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,185
I can't breathe.
Mister, are you okay?

184
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:37,250
Honey.

185
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,376
Honey!

186
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:41,587
Unless you are
planning to run,

187
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:45,007
you are backing yourself
into a very tight corner.

188
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:46,801
I'm not sure I understand
what you're implying.

189
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:49,470
Three out of seven of your
groomsmen are Hall of Famers.

190
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:51,305
She'll leave me, I know. You're
not gonna tell her, are you?

191
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,683
She's going to find out soon enough.
Oh, God.

192
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:55,184
Why didn't you say
something to me before?

193
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:57,562
I've been on a bullet train
ever since I proposed.

194
00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:59,021
I haven't slept
in months.

195
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:02,358
I can't keep anything down. I
keep losing weight. I just...

196
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,068
I just want her
to be happy.

197
00:08:04,152 --> 00:08:06,195
The truth
is always the best.

198
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,072
What if the truth
isn't an option?

199
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,657
Well...

200
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:12,451
There is one other thing.

201
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:13,911

Don't worry about Lou.

213
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:45,026
He had half his brain
removed two years ago.

214
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:46,611
Fuck off.
Okay.

Hi. Yeah.

224
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:15,181
Yeah, um, I'm looking
for Jimmy Callahan.

225
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,891
Who sent you? The Goose?

226
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,060
No. Um, Edmundo.
Ah.

227
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,938

00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:48,506
So, Edmundo sent you
to come find the Oracle.

236
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:49,632
What can I do for you?

237
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:51,926
Hi. Yeah, I guess I do have
a few questions. Mmm-hmm.

238
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:54,845
Um, what exactly
do you do?

239
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:57,181
I provide best man
services for guys

240
00:09:57,265 --> 00:09:59,475
like yourself who
lack in such areas.

241
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:01,769
So, I'm not alone?

242
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,572
Alone? No. I run a very profitable
business because of guys like you.

243
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:05,898
Here's a fun fact for you.

244
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:07,400
A kid goes to
Cornell University.

245
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:09,110
He obviously has way too
much time on his hands.

246
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:10,611
He recently confirmed
the number

247
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:12,321
of real friends
the average American has.

248
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:13,572
That means we're
not talking about

249
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:14,907
the phony
Facebook friends here.

250
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:15,950
We're talking
about the friends

251
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,201
who know where
your porn stash is.

252
00:10:17,285 --> 00:10:19,829
That number has dropped from
three to two since 1985.

253
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,206
Really?
I don't have any.

254
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,126
How many weddings do you think
were in the US last year?

255
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:26,794
Four hundred and fifty...

256
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,130
2.4 million.
Four million.

257
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,215
That means there were
2.4 million grooms.

258
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:33,009
Do you think that each and
every single one of them

259
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:34,802
has somebody
to be their best man?

260
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,971
Wow. I never knew
people like you existed.

261
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,054
I'm like an angel.

262
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,390
I'm only there when you need me to be.

263
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:41,767
Excuse me. You got to
get going, Jimmy.

264
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:43,769
Beth Shalom, right?
Beth Yirmeyahu.

265
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:44,937
I don't understand
why they do these things

266
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:46,581
in the middle of traffic.
It's annoying.

267
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,357
So, what did you
tell your fiancée?

268
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,484
I, uh, told her that
I have a best man lined up.

269
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,945
You gave her the old Norton Winchell, huh?
I did what now?

270
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,905
The Norton Winchell. It's
the imaginary-friend covet

271
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:56,469
It's an amateur move,
but it's common.

272
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,010
What about your parents?
They in on it?

273
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,243
Oh, you don't have to
worry about them.

274
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:00,828
Why, they protesting
the marriage?

275
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,247
No, they passed away several years ago.
That's perfect.

276
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:05,082
Is this a large wedding
or a small wedding?

277
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,208
Large.

278
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:07,793
Social or family?
Social.

279
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:09,337
Hancock Park,
Bel Air, Palisades?

280
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,880
Downtown,
Millennium Biltmore.

281
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:12,506
All right. Let's go
over some of my packages.

282
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,550
If you're looking for
a basic Single Wing Ringman,

283
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:15,634
that's where
I'm your best man,

284
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:16,927
I attend your wedding
for the full day.

285
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:18,429
Okay. If you need something
a little more involved,

286
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,431
where I participate in all the
festivities for the weekend,

287
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,350
then you're talking
about a Bronze Bow Tie.

288
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:23,713
Now, if you've got
real problems,

289
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:25,061
what you need
is a Silver Cuff Link.

290
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:26,687
Now, that includes everything
in the Bronze Bow Tie

291
00:11:26,771 --> 00:11:27,855
plus an additional
three groomsmen

292
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,138
to balance out
the bridesmaids.

293
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:30,524
For an extra
thousand dollars,

294
00:11:30,608 --> 00:11:31,942
I'll throw you a bachelor
party to your liking.

295
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:33,903
How are you looking on groomsmen?
Not good at all.

296
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:35,988
Not good as in
you need one or two?

297
00:11:36,072 --> 00:11:37,406
I need seven.

298
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,534
You need seven groomsmen?
I do.

299
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:42,870
Do you have any idea
what you're asking for?

300
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,955
You're asking me to
pull off a Golden Tux.

301
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:46,874
Yeah. See, I don't see that
on this pamphlet here.

302
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,125
It's not on the pamphlet.

303
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:49,489
Because what you're
talking about

304
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:50,961
is what we joke
about around here.

305
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:53,881
That's a laugh. "Hey, we should
try to do a Golden Tux."

306
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,675
Too many moving parts.
Too many things can go wrong.

307
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:57,885
No. But there's a name for it.

308
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,637
There's also a name for a horse
with a horn on its head.

309
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,472
It's called a unicorn. It
doesn't mean I can get you one.

310
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,599
She will leave me.
I need your help.

311
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,559
You're talking about
unchartered territory.

312
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:07,853
No one's ever asked me
to pull off a Golden Tux.

313
00:12:07,937 --> 00:12:09,605
And in less
than two weeks?

314
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:12,650
Look, I have a nice job,
I have a real nice business.

315
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,026
I don't need this
kind of pressure, man.

316
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,779
I don't care how much it costs.
I need a Golden Tux!

317
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,701
Are you sure
she's worth it?

318
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,913
A guy like me doesn't
land a girl like her.

319
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,207
So, I lied about having
a bunch of friends.

320
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,084
I thought it would
make me look cool.

321
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,794
Never did I think
she would like me,

322
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,421
let alone agree
to marry me.

323
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,215
I am marrying a girl
who, all my life,

324
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,217
I never would have thought
would have looked at me twice.

325
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,885
And I am marrying her.

326
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,764
What's a little white lie
in the face of that?

327
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:48,811
Please help me. I don't
know what else to do.

328
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:52,440
I love this girl.

329
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,028
I'm late.
Come on, get in the car.

330
00:12:58,112 --> 00:12:59,196
Really?

331
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,990
Yeah.
Should I follow you...

332
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:02,116
No, get in my car.
Come on.

333
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,200
And you'll drop
me off back here...

334
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:04,785
Will you just get in the
damn car, please? Okay.

335
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:06,954
I'm late, man.
God damn it.

336
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,497
Fucking white people.

337
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,668
Now, at this time,
I would like to bring up

338
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:15,963
Stuart's best friend
to say a few words.

339
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:26,724
Just five short years ago,

340
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,767
when I spoke at
Stuart's wedding,

341
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,561
I never expected

342
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,438
to be speaking
at his funeral so soon.

343
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,524
As the only Ethiopian Jew

344
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:37,943
at A.J. Wilson High School,

345
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:39,695
I was bullied quite often.

346
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:42,531
I remember one time when
these kids took my lunch

347
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:43,949
and spilled it
all over my lap.

348
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:46,395
After they did it,
they started to

349
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:48,078
call me mean names.

350
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,581
Some of them even
called me Pupil Jew-Jew.

351
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,833
Because they said when they turned
the lights out in the hallway,

352
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,168
all they could see
was my eye pupils.

353
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,920
"Pupil Jew-Jew."

354
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:57,671
"Here comes Pupil Jew-Jew."

355
00:13:57,922 --> 00:13:59,131
Some of them
even did awful

356
00:13:59,215 --> 00:14:01,509
Sammy Davis Jr.
Impressions to my face.

357
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,845
"Sha boing boing,
you black Jew-Jew."

358
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,847
I was covered
in sloppy Joe

359
00:14:06,931 --> 00:14:08,599
and mashed potatoes
and vegetable medley.

360
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:11,101
And, uh, I look up,

361
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:15,272
and I see Stu.

362
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:18,943
He was standing there
with a handful of napkins.

363
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:21,028
And a smile on his face

364
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,280
as if to say, "Everything
was going to be okay."

365
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:26,283
Stuart may have gone to that
big Shabbat in the sky,

366
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,660
but he's still with us.

367
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,871
He's up there
making sad angels laugh

368
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:32,998
and he's giving
hopeless angels hope.

369
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:34,583
And he's giving
small, little, black,

370
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,835
Jewish angels with
a face full of corn

371
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:40,381
a handful of napkins
and a smile

372
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,633
that says everything
is going to be okay.

373
00:14:50,683 --> 00:14:52,226
I am so, so sorry.

374
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:53,978
I mean, I had no idea.

375
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:55,396
This could have
easily waited.

376
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,480
Man, don't worry
about it.

377
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:59,608
All those things that you said about
him, those incredible things.

378
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,819
He really sounds like a great guy.
Who, Reinsdorf?

379
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,279
Reinsdorf was
a piece of shit.

380
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:05,197
If I end up doing
a Golden Tux for you,

381
00:15:05,281 --> 00:15:07,361
I'll say nice
things at your funeral, too.

382
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,800
Shit, for another
100 bucks, I'll throw in

383
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,372
holiday cards,
birthday calls,

384
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,249
and if you croak within seven
years of said wedding...

385
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:16,417
You're serious?

386
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,543
Serious as paint.

387
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:18,877
If I do this,
you need to understand

388
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,421
this is strictly
a business relationship.

389
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:21,839
Right. You're not
buying a new friend.

390
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,340
You're hiring a best man.
Got it.

391
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:24,883
Clients sometimes
blur that line.

392
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:25,926
I'm not looking
for a friend.

393
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,130
I am looking for a best man.

394
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:28,846
50 grand.
Done.

395
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:29,972
Plus expenses.
You got it.

396
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:31,557
Who's officiating?
Father O'Brien.

397
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,350
I never heard of him.
Her family's priest.

398
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:35,477
What's my name?
Jimmy.

399
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,938
No, my name. I'm assuming you made
up a name for me. What is it?

400
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:39,189
Oh, I thought it was
a trick question.

401
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,816
It's Bic. Bic Mitchum.

402
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:43,277
Do I wear a fucking cape?
Bic Mitchum?

403
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,486
It was an act
of desperation.

404
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,946
Bic. Hey, ladies,
what's going on?

405
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,781
My name is Bic and I got the dick.

406
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:49,366
What's happening right now?
I'm Bic Mitchum.

407
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,743
Hey, you put that down

408
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,119
and if someone
asks you who said it,

409
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,621
you tell them
Bic Mitchum said it.

410
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:55,497
What do you mean that
there's no more candy?

411
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:57,541
I'm Bic Mitchum
and I love candy.

412
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,419
I'm Bic. Where's the pussy at?
What?

413
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,670
Fuck you!
Wait.

414
00:16:01,754 --> 00:16:03,839
Fuck you, man!
No, Bic can't have these...

415
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:06,300
Bic Mitchum can have
whatever the fuck he wants!

416
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:08,510
Bic, Bic, Bic.

417
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:10,429
All right. I like it.

418
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:12,056
Doug Harris,
congratulations.

419
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,390
Allow me
to introduce myself.

420
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:14,767
My name is Bic Mitchum.

421
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,976
I'm your new best man.

422
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,312
It's great to
finally meet you.

423
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,647
No, that's bullshit, Doug.

424
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,398
"It's great to
see you again, man."

425
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:24,568
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

426
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:25,819
Yo, what are you
doing, man?

427
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:28,113
Yo, what the fuck are you doing?
What are you doing?

428
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:30,449
I'm sorry.
I just got really excited.

429
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:32,159
God damn it, man.

430
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:33,494
What do we do now?

431
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:35,120
You go get some rest.

432
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:36,330
Take care of them bags
under your eyes.

433
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:37,623
Stop hugging strangers.

434
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,958
God created the world
in seven days.

435
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,922
I got to do a whole lot
more in a lot less time.

436
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:44,296
I got to go find you
some damn friends.

437
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,006
Just keep your eye on the
ball, you little fucker.

438
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,591
And you're sure I'll get laid?
Yes.

439
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:48,842
Because I haven't gotten
any since I got out.

440
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:51,261
You'll crush ass. Seven bridesmaids.
Biltmore.

441
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:54,181
Seven? I want seven vaginas up on my face.
Do you guarantee that?

442
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,767
I can't guarantee that, but I'm
quite sure that they will want you.

443
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,144
It's you!
Look at you. Come on.

444
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:00,521
My mom isn't
paying you to talk

445
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:01,772
to your loser friends.

446
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:02,898
Loser?

447
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,067
Oh!

448
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,318
Don't talk to
Jimmy like that.

449
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:07,778
Hey, what are you
doing, Fitz?

450
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,197
I'll murder your family!
Turn it off.

451
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:13,367
Brentwood? Biltmore.
Hal Lane Orchestra.

452
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:16,412
Oh, man. Hal Lane is the best.
I know.

453
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:18,539
Hurry up and finish the van.
I'm hungry.

454
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:19,665
Okay, I'll be right there.

455
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,542
Look, Jimmy,
I'd love to help you out,

456
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,293
but I promised Marci
I'd get out of the game.

457
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:24,586
Her old man hooked
me up with this job.

458
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,380
Job? What job?
Washing the damn van?

459
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,173
I'm an apprentice.
I just take care of the van

460
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:29,925
while I learn to plumb.

461
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:32,219
Stop. You look at me now and tell
me that you don't want back in.

462
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,179
Where the heck did
you put the salad dressing,

463
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:35,764
you fat idiot?

464
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:40,310
Yeah, arms up. All right,
turn around, girl.

465
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:42,646
Damn. You're trying
to smuggle

466
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,148
some extra ass on the
flight, aren't you?

467
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,232
Isn't that what
you're doing?

468
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:46,525
Go on, girl.
You're good.

469
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:47,943
Have a nice flight.
Ooh!

470
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,987
Come on, man. You're
better than this, Reggie.

471
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,447
Who's catering this gig?
Puck.

472
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:53,907
Wolfgang? No, Hockey Puck, idiot.
'Yes, Wolfgang.

473
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,659
The only thing they've got
in this place is Cinnabon.

474
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:57,911
I've been eating
Cinnabon for breakfast,

475
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:00,164
lunch, and dinner
for the past six months.

476
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,999
Reggie, I don't need...
Okay? Of course I'm in.

477
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,202
That's all I needed to know.

478
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,251
Come on. We've a lot
of work to do.

479
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:05,502
Now?
Yes, now.

480
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,838
Hey, I'm clocking out.
I'm back in the game, baby.

481
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,966
At least Edmundo
was able to reschedule

482
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,384
the new salad dressing
tasting to tomorrow.

483
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,261
There's only a week left

484
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:15,846
and we still have
so much to do.

485
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:18,098
Doug, what are you doing?

486
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:20,517
I thought maybe we'd have
a little ice cream

487
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,562
and then perhaps
some dessert.

488
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,856
Oh, that is so not fair.
You know I'm trying

489
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,733
to lose 4.2 pounds
before the wedding.

490
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,777
Well, I think you look beautiful
just the way you are.

491
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,111
And I got you something else.

492
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:32,321
What?

493
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:34,907
Ta-da.

494
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:35,991
Oh, my God.

495
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:37,993
I remember when we watched
Girl with a Pearl Earring,

496
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,328
and you said
how pretty you thought

497
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:40,621
the girl's pearl earring was.

498
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:41,984
So, I went out
and had it remade.

499
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,373
You know, as a pair.

500
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,375
Oh, my God.
You are so sweet.

501
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,169
That was so unnecessary.

502
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:50,255
Is that Boyz ll Men?

503
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:53,717
You know, I was thinking

504
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:56,094
of a way to alleviate

505
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,305
all that stress
you've been feeling.

506
00:18:58,472 --> 00:18:59,598
That is not fair.

507
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,225
Remember, we said no teasing
each other. Mmm-mmm.

508
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,477
I know we agreed to
the whole "no making love"

509
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,978
"for the last month" rule.

510
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:06,188
That's a lot of quotes.

511
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:08,482
Yeah, but maybe
I could request

512
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,442
a temporary stay of the ban.

513
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:13,529
No. Honey, look,
I would love to, okay?

514
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:15,656
But the article says
this will enhance

515
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,533
our emotional reunification.

516
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:20,369
I know. Maybe we could
take one night off.

517
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,663
Can we do that, maybe?

518
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:24,373
Just for one night.

519
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,999
To just have sex?

520
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,210
Honey, you know this is
difficult for me, too, okay?

521
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,838
But I am willing to make
the necessary sacrifice

522
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:33,632
to make sure that our
wedding night is perfect.

523
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:36,552
Doug and I met
at Camp Wampacheempi.

524
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:40,639
We were both 12, and we used
to sneak out together at night

525
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,724
and hunt bullfrogs and...

526
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,685
I'm sorry.
I dropped a line.

527
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:46,144
I know I keep
tripping over it.

528
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:47,348
You know what?
You nailed it.

529
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:49,064
What about the distractions?
Do you have any party tricks?

530
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:50,482
Party tricks. Yeah, okay.

531
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:52,276
Oh!

532
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:55,279
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.

533
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,031
So, that's kind of it.

534
00:19:58,115 --> 00:19:59,867
I just need a wall.
No, no, no!

535
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:01,994
No, don't, please.

536
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,706
I got it. There it goes.

537
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,791
Bronstein.

538
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:11,962
Um, I prepared
the scene from Titanic

539
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,463
where Jack
tries to save Rose...

540
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:16,800
Stop. We specifically asked for monologues.
We don't want any scenes.

541
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:18,176
Right, but I thought
that this would...

542
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,303
It said monologue.

543
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,069
This would showcase my talent.
Thank you.

544
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,098
I could read
the part of Rose.

545
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:26,518
My name is Kip Loyola.

546
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,520
I'm 6'4".

547
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:29,938
You don't have to...

548
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:31,148
6'3".

549
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:34,484
As you can see by my
résumé, I've done tons

550
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:37,404
of soap operas.

551
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:40,157
Well, uh, did you
prepare anything?

552
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,454
On! Shit, baby!

553
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:47,039
All right.
Did you, uh...

554
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:48,332
Is that, uh...

555
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,876
Do you have
a distraction

556
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,295
or a party trick
that ties in with this?

557
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:57,925
Uh...

558
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,343
Okay, I guess.

559
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:01,345
That's your...

560
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:02,721
Hey, this is bullshit, Jimmy.

561
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,556
You promised me
a spot on the team.

562
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,880
Hey, look, O,
it's not like this

563
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:07,225
is a Single Wing
Ringman thing.

564
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,268
I told you
I need you to drive.

565
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:09,770
I'm sick of driving.
I want in.

566
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,104
You can't have in
because you don't

567
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:12,439
have a party trick
distraction, do you?

568
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:14,274
I told you I've been working on
the talking backwards thing.

569
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:15,609
Well, no offense, O,
but you've been

570
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,027
saying the same thing
for three months.

571
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,278
Months three
for that saying been

572
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:20,530
you've but O
offense no well yeah.

573
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:21,854
That's pretty
fucking cool.

574
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:23,909
- Cool fucking pretty that's.
- Whoa!

575
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,285
How much wood
could a woodchuck chuck

576
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:26,609
if a woodchuck
could chuck wood?

577
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:27,704
No.

578
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,541
Wood chuck could
chuck wood a if chuck

579
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,418
chuck wood a could
wood much how.

580
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:34,711
Oh!

581
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:37,130
Okay, that'll do.

582
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:38,340
Do that'll okay.

583
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,133
Put a sock in it.
We're done.

584
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:41,385
Sock on put.

585
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:46,431
Try the Roquefort
Buttermilk.

586
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,227
Is it too tangy?

587
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,062
Uh, maybe a little.
A little?

588
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,481
Do you have something, maybe, a little
less harsh? 'Cause he's like...

589
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:57,025
I can offer you
the Algonquin Ranch.

590
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:58,235
Okay, give me one second.

591
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,904
Ray. A.R., ASAP.

592
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:04,449
Okay, honey, we're all set tomorrow.
Brunch at my parents' house.

593
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:07,744
Oh, yeah. Oh, sweetie,
I thought I told you that

594
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:11,039
I got to, uh, hit the office
tomorrow. I'm sorry.

595
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:13,626
Oh, no, no. Edmundo's bringing
some more appetizer samples.

596
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:15,919
You know I can't make
a decision without you.

597
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:19,798
Damn it. I was going to keep
this a surprise, but...

598
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:22,175
What? Bic is flying
in tomorrow morning.

599
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:23,510
Bic? The Bic?

600
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:24,803
Yeah. I have to go pick
him up from the airport.

601
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,138
You aren't kidding!
Oh, I'm so excited!

602
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:27,421
I wanted to keep
it a surprise.

603
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:29,433
This is so great.
Bring him to lunch with you.

604
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:32,477
No! No. No, I can't.
Why are you yelling?

605
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:34,604
I'm sorry. I just, uh...

606
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:36,273
I can't do that
because, um,

607
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:38,191
we have so much
catching up to do.

608
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:39,443
Oh, come on. Bring Bic.

609
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,486
I want him to help us decide
on all these fun things.

610
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,531
No, I don't know that that's...
He can't...

611
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:45,991
Listen to me.
He is your best man

612
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:47,325
and I have
never met him, okay?

613
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:49,119
You cannot tell me
he's flying in and not

614
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,246
bring him to lunch tomorrow.
Are you crazy?

615
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:52,581
Okay.

616
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:55,792
No! Take my hand.
I'll pull you in.

617
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:59,504
<i>Stay where you are.
I mean it. I'll let go.</i>

618
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:00,589
Oh.

619
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,723
♪ Near, far... ♪

620
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,559
Hey. Doug's on line one.
Something's wrong.

621
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:14,603
What's going on, Tonto?

622
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:16,938
Hey, there.
We've got a bit of a problem.

623
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:20,317
What the hell were you thinking?
She cornered me.

624
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,444
Doug, in the future, if
somebody asks you something

625
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:24,780
that boxes you in, you boomerang it.
"Boomerang"?

626
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:27,074
You respond with either a
compliment or a question.

627
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:28,950
Compliments are for women.
Questions are for men.

628
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:30,452
If I were to ask you
something about Bic

629
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:31,578
that you and I
haven't discussed,

630
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:32,661
what would you say, Doug?

631
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:36,166
You're, um, very handsome.
Thank you, Doug.

632
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:37,918
That's a compliment.

633
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,587
Compliments are for women,
questions are for men.

634
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,797
You throw out random words.

635
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,423
You're confusing me
a lot right now.

636
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:44,758
You use random words
that will distract them

637
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:45,926
from the original question.

638
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,052
Random words.

639
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:49,054
We have 18 hours to prepare for
this brunch with the Palmers.

640
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:51,598
Which means we have 18 hours
for a Shotgun Intro.

641
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:52,681
Let's get to work.

642
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:53,850
You want to start off
with the HW2's.

643
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:55,644
Right.
The how-where-whats.

644
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:56,853
These are the three
basic questions

645
00:23:56,937 --> 00:23:58,688
that everyone I encounter
as Bic are going to ask.

646
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:01,191
How did we meet? Where am I from?
What do I do?

647
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,819
If we know nothing else,
we can tread enough water

648
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:06,279
to fake a stomach cramp and run away.
How did we meet?

649
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:08,615
Uh, freshman year,
Stanford.

650
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:10,575
That means I'm smart.
Shit. Where am I from?

651
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:12,369
I never said.
North Dakota.

652
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,371
Why North Dakota? Do you know
anybody in North Dakota?

653
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,164
No.
Nobody does. What do I do?

654
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,416
You're in the military. That a boy.
See, now you're thinking.

655
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,918
No address, no phone number.

656
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,711
And chicks dig
the uniform shit.

657
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:23,296
It's going to be like
shooting fish in a barrel.

658
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,298
Actually, I, uh, don't
think you're going to be

659
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:27,134
shooting any fish
in this particular barrel.

660
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:28,417
An Army guy
that's the best man

661
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:29,668
not hitting on
the bridesmaids?

662
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:30,971
They'll think
I'm a homosexual.

663
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:32,222
Well, uh, actually...

664
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:34,432
Well, actually, what? You told
them I'm a homosexual, Doug?

665
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:36,476
No. No, not that,
per se.

666
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,186
What, per se, Doug?
Tell me.

667
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:41,106
Bic Mitchum is actually
Father Bic Mitchum.

668
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:42,774
You told them
I'm a fucking priest, Doug?

669
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:45,026
Well, actually, it was
Gretchen who said it.

670
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,695
You told Gretchen
I'm a fucking priest, Doug?

671
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:47,946
No. Gretchen said...

672
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,322
There was nothing else
that popped into your head?

673
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:50,991
At the time I thought it
was a really smart idea.

674
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:52,074
A fucking priest?

675
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:54,911
But now I can see it's going to upset you.
A fucking priest?

676
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:58,915
Fuck! Fuck, shit, bitch, dick, ass!
No. No, you can't.

677
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:00,625
Oh, well, I have to
get them all out now

678
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:02,169
because I'm a fucking
priest and I can't

679
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:03,920
cuss around
your family, Doug. Fuck!

680
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:06,006
Oh, come on.
That's the last one.

681
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:09,968
Jill Abromowitz,
freshman year.

682
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:12,053
Far-sighted or near-sighted'?
Far-sighted.

683
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,764
Okay. Wait, let me finish.
And near-sighted.

684
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:17,350
Do you supinate or pronate?
What?

685
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:19,603
Does your foot roll inward or outward?
Outward.

686
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:21,188
Okay, that explains
the weight gain.

687
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:24,232
Pepsi or Coke?
Sunset, full moon?

688
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:26,026
If you could pick your favorite
superhero, who would it be?

689
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:27,235
Is Pas-Man a superhero?

690
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,403
No, he's not, Doug.

691
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,864
Stairs or elevators?
Never mind. Forget it.

692
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:32,908
Okay, Doug, I'm almost happy right now.
What's my name?

693
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:34,711
That would be Bic Mitchum.
Where am I from?

694
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:35,869
You're from North Dakota.

695
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:37,037
Ask me why you're
from North Dakota.

696
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,330
Tell me why I'm
from North Dakota.

697
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:40,707
Because who the fuck knows
anybody from North Dakota?

698
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,292
I want to hear my name again.
What's my name?

699
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,502
Oh, you are motherfucking Bic Mitchum!
Rhythm.

700
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:45,962
Motherfucking
Bic Mitchum.

701
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:48,798
Motherfucking Bic Mitchum.
Motherfucking...

702
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,050
What are your phobias?

703
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,468
Uh, I fear raccoons.

704
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:52,636
Favorite sport, Doug?

705
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:55,347
Baseball. And I love
women's basketball.

706
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:58,892
Come on, we're getting
too tired. Up. Yes.

707
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:02,187
Oh, shit.

708
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:07,108
Doug! Doug!

709
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:09,637
Get up. Get your ass up. We're
going to be late for brunch.

710
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:10,695
Oh, shit!

711
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:12,516
When you get
backed into a corner,

712
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,530
remember your compliments,
boomerang, random words.

713
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:15,575
Use random words.

714
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,786
Specifically, which
random words should I use?

715
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:21,164
Any random words. Just be yourself, Doug.
You'll be all right.

716
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:22,749
What if they start
asking too many questions?

717
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:24,709
I mean, you hardly
even know me.

718
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:26,920
Except for the fact that you
prefer showers to baths,

719
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:28,380
Pas-Man's your favorite
superhero even though

720
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:29,798
Pas-Man's not
a superhero at all,

721
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:31,967
you're far-sighted and you're
near-sighted, you supinate,

722
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,594
you prefer full moons over sunsets,
you're afraid of raccoons,

723
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:36,554
you love women's basketball,
you iron your boxers,

724
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:37,639
finished third
on the bar exam,

725
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:38,723
eat American,
but prefer cheddar,

726
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:40,934
you're against the designated hitter,
believe in life after death,

727
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:42,727
and you played the violin
until you were 19 years old.

728
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:45,611
Which is the same year that you lost
your virginity to Jill Abromowitz.

729
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:46,773
Let's go, man.

730
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:47,857
That will work.

731
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:51,027
You follow my lead. You
talk as little as you can.

732
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:54,281
Short answers. You don't
initiate conversation. Wi-Wo.

733
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:56,366
"Wi-Wo"?
We're in, we're out.

734
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:57,826
Oh. Wi-WO.

735
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:59,661
Wait, wait, wait.
What?

736
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:01,746
I'm getting a little nauseous, man.
What?

737
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:03,748
I think I'm in over my head, Doug.
No, no.

738
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:05,709
This is a lot. You're talking
about a whole family.

739
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,043
I've never done
a goddamn whole family.

740
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:08,461
You're telling me
this now?

741
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:09,713
What's your last name?

742
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:10,922
Harris. Doug Harris.

743
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:12,465
Oh, shit!
I thought it was Angley.

744
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:14,134
What? Who's Angley?

745
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:16,219
I have to go, buddy.
No!

746
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:17,470
I'm fucking with you.

747
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:18,972
Don't do that.
All right, relax.

748
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,140
That was a really
shitty thing to do.

749
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:22,392
Ring the bell, rookie.
Come on.

750
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:24,144
You guys have to understand
that I come from

751
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:25,729
a very dark past.

752
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:27,314
And by dark,
of course I'm referring

753
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:29,399
to my drug use.
I was on everything.

754
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:32,068
At one point, the only good
vein I had was between my toes.

755
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:34,863
Crystal meth. I'm not sure if any
of you guys can relate to it.

756
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:36,281
Grandma,
I've seen your teeth.

757
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:37,574
Maybe you can, or can't.

758
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:41,036
But the Lord says, "Don't
judgeth upon what happens",

759
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,413
"but what happens upon
what can't be judged."

760
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:44,664
Which means, yes,

761
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:46,041
I may have been to a point

762
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:47,917
where I was sucking
dick for money.

763
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:51,338
But that day when I woke up
face down in that snowbank,

764
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:52,672
I didn't know where I was.

765
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:54,632
I didn't even know
who I was.

766
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,039
And I remember
squinting because

767
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:57,552
I was being blinded
by this bright light.

768
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:58,636
I couldn't see a thing.

769
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,098
And when I finally opened
my eyes, I saw Jesus.

770
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:03,475
You saw Jesus?

771
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:04,809
Oh, I saw Jesus.

772
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,146
He was in Mary's arms in the
nativity scene at St. Michael's.

773
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:11,649
And I wept. But they
weren't tears of pain.

774
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:12,901
These were tears of joy.

775
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:14,778
From having found
my path, of course.

776
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:16,154
So, Father...

777
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:17,655
Call me Bic, please.

778
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:20,367
What made you decide
to go into the military?

779
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,160
Mmm.
That's a great question.

780
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:24,537
Some people are called on
to serve God.

781
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:26,206
Others are called
to serve our country.

782
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:28,208
Those who are
chosen to serve both,

783
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,709
they're called
Army chaplains.

784
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:32,420
I got a two-way call
from the big fellow himself.

785
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,548
A priest in the military.
Yeah.

786
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:37,592
It's interesting.
Do they have a "don't ask",

787
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,886
"don't tell" policy
on child molesting?

788
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:41,096
Dad!

789
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:51,898
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

790
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:55,276
That's pretty good. I've never heard
that one. Now, that's a good one.

791
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:56,528
Well, I try.

792
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:58,071
Clever.
No, it wasn't.

793
00:28:58,154 --> 00:28:59,364
Somebody call the firemen

794
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:01,366
because this is hot,
hot, hot! Okay?

795
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:02,909
Do not touch.

796
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,329
So, listen,
if you opt against

797
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:07,997
the Russian
mushroom bisque,

798
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:10,917
we can always go into
a more rustic theme

799
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,710
with the Chilean chili.

800
00:29:13,044 --> 00:29:14,796
I'll be back
with the croutons.

801
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:18,633
So, Bic, uh, where are
you from originally?

802
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:20,343
Originally? North Dakota.

803
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:22,929
Oh, no kidding. What town?
Henderson.

804
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,639
I've never heard
of Henderson.

805
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:26,224
Oh, Henderson's
a very small town, Ed.

806
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:28,017
Oh, where is it
in relation to Bismarck?

807
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:30,937
Are you familiar
with North Dakota?

808
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,605
Ed's uncle has
a ranch up there.

809
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:34,983
Wow! That is something
to know, there.

810
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:37,277
Uh, no, it's actually on the
opposite side of Bismarck.

811
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,487
You have Bismarck here,
but once you go around...

812
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:41,114
You know the tunnel.
It's right there.

813
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:42,490
Bismarck's in the middle.

814
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:45,095
When you said "middle", all I saw
was Rita Hayworth.

815
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:47,121
I mean, there's a striking
resemblance, isn't it?

816
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:48,288
Oh, thank you, Father.

817
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:49,539
No, there isn't.

818
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:52,083
So, Doug,
when was the last time

819
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:54,169
that you and Bic
saw each other?

820
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:57,755
March.
March?

821
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:58,965
Well, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

822
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:01,288
Because, see, in March... April,
I was in the Middle East.

823
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:03,803
Muffin juice. After that
is when I was training.

824
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:04,929
Cottage cheese helmet.

825
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:06,931
And from there is
when I was traveling,

826
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:08,057
so you're talking
three, four...

827
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:10,059
Three, four, six, seven months ago.
...six, seven years ago.

828
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:11,144
Years ago.

829
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:13,188
Honey, I thought you saw Bic at
the Vatican a couple years ago.

830
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:14,272
Wait, what did you say?

831
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:16,274
When you were in Rome,
you and Bic.

832
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:18,943
Oh, boy, that's right.
Because you left in March.

833
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:20,612
Red-hot pussy seltzer.

834
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:22,697
Right? Right. Yeah.

835
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,781
That sounds right.

836
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:25,200
- What did you just say?
- Hmm?

837
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:27,535
I think you said,
"Red-hot pussy seltzer."

838
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:29,746
- Why would you say that?
- Red-hot pussy seltzer?

839
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:31,789
Honey?

840
00:30:32,415 --> 00:30:34,459
What's 34 times 12?
408.

841
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:36,669
Shit, I didn't expect
an answer that quick.

842
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:37,754
Breathe, Doug.

843
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:39,589
Baby, what is going on with you?

844
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:40,798
I, uh...

845
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:42,759
I, um...

846
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:45,678
I have to be
honest with you guys.

847
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:47,514
Oh, my God!

848
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:51,476
Honey?
Shit, that burns!

849
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:54,270
Guys, that was so hot. I'm sorry, Doug.
It burns!

850
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:55,605
Oh, God!

851
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,368
Sorry. I didn't know
it was that hot, guys.

852
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:58,858
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

853
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:00,860
- I'm on fire!
- Oh, my God!

854
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:03,905
Shit! No! She's on fire!

855
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:08,034
- It's an inferno!
- Holy shit!

856
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:12,121
- I need liquids!
- Get back!

857
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:14,707
- Oh, my God!
- Get something!

858
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,377
It's making it worse!

859
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:20,838
Give me the tablecloth!

860
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:22,090
What is wrong with you?

861
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:23,413
I'm going to get
something else!

862
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:26,135
She just caught fire
so fast.

863
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:30,181
Don't feel bad, Doug. She goes
through a can of Aqua Net a day.

864
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:33,101
Hey, what did they say? Is she okay?
Is she going to be all right?

865
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:36,229
Gretchen, how do you
like your grandma?

866
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:39,482
What? I love her. You know that.
What happened?

867
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:41,734
No, I mean, how do you like her?
Medium, well-done?

868
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:42,985
Oh, my God, Dad.

869
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:44,195
You can be
such an asshole.

870
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,738
She has some minor burns

871
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:47,574
to her head, chest,
back, neck, and breasts,

872
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:49,337
but the doctor says
she's going to be fine.

873
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:51,077
Oh, thank God. Come
on, let's go see her.

874
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:53,371
I, uh...
I feel just awful.

875
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:54,738
Well, shake it off.
If you knew

876
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:56,082
what the old lady says
behind your back,

877
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:57,542
you would have
done it on purpose.

878
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:00,211
But let me say, that was a hell
of a tackle for a tenderfoot.

879
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:04,090
Tenderfoot? Oh, Douglas was quite
the halfback back in college.

880
00:32:04,257 --> 00:32:06,426
You played football, Doug?
How come you never told me?

881
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:08,428
I thought you were
just a nerd fan.

882
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:13,183
Yeah. Yeah,
intramurals, scrimmage.

883
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:14,976
We scrimmaged, the boys.

884
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:18,354
And, you know, I made the all-campus
team a couple times in football.

885
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:19,981
I was an all-conference
nose tackle.

886
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:22,150
Half the team's
coming in for the wedding.

887
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:24,902
Why don't we have a friendly
game of two-hand touch?

888
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:26,946
You know, the old-timers
versus the groomsmen.

889
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,031
What do you say?

890
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:30,366
I think that's
quite the invitation, Ed,

891
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,118
but there's
so much going on.

892
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:34,829
I just feel like
there's not enough time.

893
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:36,623
Oh, what's
the matter, Bic?

894
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:39,042
Afraid of getting your asses
kicked by some old-timers?

895
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:45,214
I don't think so, Pops.

896
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:54,265
All things considered, not
that bad for a Shotgun Intro.

897
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:58,227
Not that bad? I just set
Gretchen's grandmother on fire.

898
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:01,022
Wrong. We sacrificed Grandma
for the sake of the mission.

899
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:02,148
I feel terrible.

900
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:04,275
Feelings are irrelevant
in the big con.

901
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,569
What's important is that
our cover wasn't blown.

902
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:09,238
Every test that we encounter
will be the same, pass or fail.

903
00:33:09,322 --> 00:33:11,199
As long as we pass, it
doesn't matter how we do it.

904
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:13,326
I still can't believe they
actually bought all that

905
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:15,620
People believe because they
have no reason not to.

906
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:16,829
We're going to have to
be on top of our game.

907
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:18,081
That family was sharp.

908
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:19,374
Come on,
we've got to go.

909
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:21,497
I've got some really important
people waiting on us.

910
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:24,577
Look who I have?
Dougie-Doug-Doug!

911
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:25,588
Dougie Fresh!

912
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:26,714
Doug, you look great, man.

913
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:27,840
You're losing weight,
fat ass.

914
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:29,164
Oh, he had to
lose weight.

915
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:31,761
Ow!

916
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:34,347
All right.
All right, stop.

917
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,058
Who are these people?
What, are you kidding?

918
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:38,518
You don't recognize these guys?
No.

919
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:40,561
You're looking at your groomsmen.
Come on, man.

920
00:33:40,645 --> 00:33:41,729
Hey, Doug.

921
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:46,233
How have you been, bro?

922
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:48,528
Good. Yeah, real good. You?

923
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:50,029
You know,
same old same old.

924
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:54,534
Stop it, man.
Stop it, man.

925
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:56,452
Every time. Every time.

926
00:33:56,536 --> 00:33:58,121
Jimmy, can I talk to you
for a second?

927
00:33:58,204 --> 00:33:59,956
These guys cannot
be my groomsmen.

928
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,124
What are you
talking about?

929
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:03,376
For one thing, it looks like
the entire cast of Goonies

930
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:04,539
grew up and became rapists.

931
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:05,753
This one in particular
looks like

932
00:34:05,837 --> 00:34:07,505
he just broke out of
a federal fucking prison.

933
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:09,588
What you need to do is keep
it down because he did.

934
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,800
And he raped
a lot of men in there. Yes.

935
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:13,052
Oh, my God. Oh, Jesus.

936
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:15,897
He's got a dark past, but when you
throw a tux on that son of a bitch,

937
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,056
you're not going to
find anybody better.

938
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,641
The Asian
has his dick out.

939
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:20,184
Endo, put it up.

940
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:22,019
No. You have to get
a new party trick.

941
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:24,856
People love it.
Is that a third testicle?

942
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:26,649
Does he have three testicles?
Yeah, I've got three.

943
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:28,818
How is that a party trick?
That's neither here nor there.

944
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:30,653
Oh, I'm dead. You didn't
give me a lot of time, man.

945
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:31,738
Oh, God.

946
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:33,531
You gave me seven names, I brought
you back seven groomsmen.

947
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:35,533
I should just call it off. No!
These guys are great, man.

948
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:38,077
You're looking at the best of the best.
Not the best of the best.

949
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:40,288
They're the best of
what I had to choose from.

950
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,415
I'm dead.

951
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,250
We've got Dickerson.
Yo.

952
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,294
Dickerson, you're a lounge
singer from Canada.

953
00:34:46,377 --> 00:34:48,796
You perform four nights a
week at the Walleye Nook.

954
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,090
You do a mean Tom Jones.
Now, that part's imperative.

955
00:34:51,174 --> 00:34:52,717
She won't buy it unless she
knows that you can sing.

956
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,885
Doug, I'm not
trying to be rude,

957
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:55,094
but nobody here
really gives a fuck.

958
00:34:55,178 --> 00:34:56,262
We're just
assigning roles.

959
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:58,139
We can get all the ancillary
particulars later on.

960
00:34:58,222 --> 00:34:59,307
Garvey,
you're a botanist.

961
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,143
You and Doug went to camp together
from 6th grade through 10th.

962
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:06,522
Rambis, you're a principal at Saint
Peter's Middle School in Provo, Utah.

963
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:10,193
And you're a regional racquetball champion.
Lefty, good serve.

964
00:35:10,526 --> 00:35:11,944
Plunkett, you're a lawyer.

965
00:35:12,028 --> 00:35:15,281
You specialize in environmental
law with a focus on forestry.

966
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:17,366
Carew, you're
a podiatrist in Knoxville.

967
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,868
Divorced, no kids.

968
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,912
I have to say, all these
guys seem a little off,

969
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:22,663
but you
at least look normal.

970
00:35:22,747 --> 00:35:24,791
Oh, thanks, Doug,
I appreciate that, man.

971
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:27,376
I'm just happy to
be here.

972
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:30,880
Drysdale,
you teach philosophy

973
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:32,465
at Bardonia
Community College.

974
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:33,591
You're a vegan.

975
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:36,803
You're also working on your first
book called The Way of Wonder.

976
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:38,721
What the fuck
does that even mean?

977
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:41,265
Thanks, Doug,
you fucking asshole.

978
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:43,309
Alzado, you're
a computer programmer.

979
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:44,352
You met Dougie
at a conference

980
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:45,478
in Baton Rouge.

981
00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:46,604
Do you want to trade?

982
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:48,022
Hell, yeah. I need to
eat some meat, man.

983
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:49,106
This vegan life
isn't for me.

984
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,900
Hey. There will be
no trading!

985
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:53,319
Anything else, Doug? Yeah. Plunkett's
got to be in a wheelchair.

986
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:54,737
He was hit by a car.
What?

987
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:56,447
Well, it's not funny.

988
00:35:56,531 --> 00:35:57,657
I'm supposed to crush ass.

989
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,033
I told him he was
going to crush ass.

990
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:00,159
- Argh!
- Listen up.

991
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:02,870
Double check your measurements
and perfect your PTD's, guys.

992
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:05,206
"PTD'S"? That's your Party
Trick Distractions.

993
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:07,208
If you get backed in a corner
and you don't know what to do,

994
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:08,334
pull out your PTD.

995
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:10,086
Can I do my Cockney accent?

996
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:12,713
You're a principal in Utah. Why the
fuck would you have a Cockney accent?

997
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:14,465
I could have
moved there, right?

998
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:17,802
Any more questions?

999
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:19,428
Yeah. When is
the bachelor party?

1000
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:21,013
I don't see nothing
in the package about it.

1001
00:36:21,097 --> 00:36:22,223
That's a good question.

1002
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:24,141
Oh, no, no. There's going
to be no bachelor party.

1003
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:26,644
Gretchen and I, we both decided
that it was better that we...

1004
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:30,064
Stop. There's no such thing as a mutual
decision until after you're married.

1005
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:32,316
Right now, the only "we..."

1006
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,235
ls me and my balls.

1007
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:35,403
Balls.

1008
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:37,738
All right, guys, listen up.

1009
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:42,451
You have one week to know
this information so well,

1010
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,954
it becomes a permanent
part of your memory.

1011
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:50,376
That means that we've got one
week to pull off the first ever

1012
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:53,004
Golden Tux.

1013
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:57,592
Understand something. This has
never been done, gentlemen.

1014
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:02,494

What are you doing?

1039
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:06,877
It's a trick
I learned in Vietnam.

1040
00:38:06,953 --> 00:38:08,663
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

1041
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:11,499
Just prepping for
a little bit of this.

1042
00:38:11,582 --> 00:38:12,792
Tahiti?

1043
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:13,875
Voted the number-one

1044
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:15,628
most romantic
honeymoon destination.

1045
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:16,796
That's amazing!

1046
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:17,999
It's going to be incredible.

1047
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:20,257
Oh, my gosh. Honey, that's...

1048
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:22,301
Hey, what has gotten
into you this week?

1049
00:38:22,385 --> 00:38:24,220
I've just never
seen you so frisky.

1050
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:26,013
I just feel really good
about everything.

1051
00:38:26,097 --> 00:38:27,417
We're getting married
on Saturday.

1052
00:38:27,473 --> 00:38:29,392
It's exciting. Your friends
are gonna be there.

1053
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:30,795
My friends are
all gonna be there.

1054
00:38:30,893 --> 00:38:32,061
I just hope
it all goes smoothly.

1055
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:33,479
I checked
the 10-day forecast.

1056
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:36,232
Sweetie, it's LA. It's not
like it's going to rain.

1057
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:37,984
What the fuck
did you just say?

1058
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:39,777
Whoa.
Are you kidding?

1059
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,860
What are you doing?

1060
00:38:40,903 --> 00:38:42,279
Why did you say
the fucking R-word?

1061
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:43,698
Shh.
Calm down. Calm down.

1062
00:38:43,823 --> 00:38:45,700
I didn't say it was going to rain.

1063
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:48,536
You just said it again. This
is twice now in two minutes.

1064
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:49,912
Are you fucking serious?

1065
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:50,997
Gretchen, calm down.

1066
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,208
I just don't understand why you
continue to say this stupid shit.

1067
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:56,419
Okay, you're right. But you know what?

1068
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:59,547
We climbed
the glaciers of what?

1069
00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:01,298
Uh...

1070
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:03,217
It was... It was, uh...

1071
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:05,344
It's Patagonia.
Padronia.

1072
00:39:05,428 --> 00:39:06,428
Patagonia.

1073
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,596
Political views?

1074
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,723
Staunch Republican.
Got it.

1075
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:11,392
Patagonia.
Pagon.

1076
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:13,853
I'm a doctor.
What type?

1077
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:16,147
Podiatrist.
Is that right?

1078
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,024
I think that's right.
That's what it says?

1079
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:19,358
Yeah. I'm a kid doctor.

1080
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:20,609
No.

1081
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:22,486
What are your views
on gluten?

1082
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,779
It's a myth.

1083
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:25,156
Pata...
Pata...

1084
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:26,240
...go...

1085
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:29,326
My name is Hobie Plunkett
and I collect...

1086
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,454
Playbills.
Cabbage Patch Kids?

1087
00:39:31,537 --> 00:39:34,206
No, man, it's exotic pets,
you dumb motherfucker.

1088
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,042
Dumb? You can't even say
"Patagonia," you idiot.

1089
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:37,209
Garvey's family
owns a "blank" farm.

1090
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:38,293
Chinchillas.

1091
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:39,670
Nice.

1092
00:39:39,754 --> 00:39:41,589
Hey, come on, we have to
hammer out this toast, man.

1093
00:39:41,672 --> 00:39:42,715
Right.

1094
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:44,592
They're going to want to
know why she's "the one."

1095
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:46,595
It's like a band playing
their most popular song.

1096
00:39:46,677 --> 00:39:47,887
The crowd is just
waiting to hear it.

1097
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,690
Let's start with
the first time you saw her.

1098
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:52,892
Oh, she was
wearing a dress.

1099
00:39:52,975 --> 00:39:56,645
And she was pretty.

1100
00:39:58,314 --> 00:40:02,068
That's it? Why are you marrying her?
Why are you in love with her?

1101
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:04,361
What makes her different than any
other girl that you ever met?

1102
00:40:04,445 --> 00:40:06,280
She talked to me.
She talked to you?

1103
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:08,824
What? Yeah, seriously. Her dad
was a client at the firm.

1104
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:10,409
I had seen her
a couple of times,

1105
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:11,973
but she never gave me
the time of day.

1106
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:15,247
And then one day I ran into
her, and it was just different.

1107
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:17,750
She knew my name, she asked
me to go get a sandwich.

1108
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:20,878
You're not helping me.
You have to dig deep.

1109
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:23,089
Like, "From across the
room, she looked at me"

1110
00:40:23,172 --> 00:40:24,612
"and I swear it was like
slow motion.

1111
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,469
"All the room stood still. I closed
my eyes and I reached out my hand,

1112
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:30,179
"and in return,
I got a soul."

1113
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:33,015
"And that's when I knew
that we were soul mates."

1114
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:34,600
That's what I need, Doug.

1115
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:36,102
But that's not real.

1116
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:41,982
All right, Tonto.
Do you want to see real?

1117
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:47,988
Yo!
Puta madre. I'm coming.

1118
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:53,035
Hi! Oh, my God!

1119
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:56,288
What a delightful surprise.

1120
00:40:56,372 --> 00:40:59,166
I wish you would have called before.
My place is a pig sty.

1121
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,584
Eddie. Hey,
Eddie, stop. Stop.

1122
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:02,169
No mas. He's one of us.

1123
00:41:02,253 --> 00:41:03,296
What the fuck, cabrón?

1124
00:41:03,379 --> 00:41:05,464
Yeah. What the hell
is going on here?

1125
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:07,716
I want to introduce you
to Dirty Eddie Sanchez.

1126
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:10,386
His family had
a wedding planning business

1127
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:12,304
that was one of
the biggest in the city.

1128
00:41:12,388 --> 00:41:15,391
But, after Father of the Bride
came out on DVD and Blu-ray,

1129
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:17,268
nobody wanted to take advice
from a Mexican kid

1130
00:41:17,351 --> 00:41:18,519
from Boyle Heights.

1131
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:20,846
So, what he decided to do
was flame it up a little bit.

1132
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,399
Hence, Edmundo.

1133
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:25,192
Da-da-da-da!

1134
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:26,610
Business skyrocketed.

1135
00:41:26,694 --> 00:41:29,280
This is so fucked up
on so many levels.

1136
00:41:29,697 --> 00:41:33,450
So, ese, why did you
bring him here?

1137
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:35,496
He's taking this wedding
thing way too seriously.

1138
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:38,747
All right, look, vato, weddings
are just overblown parties

1139
00:41:38,831 --> 00:41:41,208
direct from women's
unreasonable fantasies

1140
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:43,586
and preconceived notions
that originated in childhood.

1141
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:45,712
So, don't sweat the morality
of what you're doing.

1142
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:48,257
Just make sure the bride
and her mother are happy.

1143
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,050
We're in this together,
homie.

1144
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:51,260
Is that your girl?

1145
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:52,720
Fuck no.
That's my sister.

1146
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,722
That's my girl.

1147
00:41:55,014 --> 00:41:56,765
What's up?
Oh, fuck.

1148
00:41:56,849 --> 00:41:58,100
Do you want some nachos?

1149
00:41:58,184 --> 00:41:59,226
I'm actually okay.

1150
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,311
No, late before I came.

1151
00:42:00,394 --> 00:42:01,353
I'm sorry.
What did you just ask them?

1152
00:42:01,437 --> 00:42:02,438
I asked them if
they wanted nachos.

1153
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:03,522
Nachos?

1154
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:04,690
The guy's getting
married in a week

1155
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:05,900
and you're gonna
offer him nachos?

1156
00:42:05,983 --> 00:42:08,027
Look at him! What do you think
cheese is going to do to him?

1157
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,236
I thought
they wanted nachos.

1158
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,446
Use your fucking head.

1159
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:11,697
I'm going to take some.

1160
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,780
Sit down, Jimmy!

1161
00:42:12,823 --> 00:42:14,366
I tried.

1162
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:20,039
They've been together for some time now.
Nothing's going to happen.

1163
00:42:20,122 --> 00:42:21,540
What?
Nothing.

1164
00:42:21,624 --> 00:42:23,083
You guys make
a beautiful couple.

1165
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:24,210
Bitches, right?

1166
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:27,504
Do you want some weed?

1167
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:28,631
No, no, I'm good.

1168

1179
00:42:58,953 --> 00:43:00,037
Why are we here?

1180
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,956
It's called a dry run.
I do it with all my grooms.

1181
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:03,916
I hate this stuff.

1182
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:07,711
Hey, that's why we're here.
Groom desensitization, okay?

1183
00:43:07,795 --> 00:43:09,421
That's a rum and Coke.
That's your favorite, right?

1184
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:10,464
Yeah. How did you know that?

1185
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:12,174
I know everything, Doug.
Drink up.

1186
00:43:12,258 --> 00:43:14,009
All right, I want you to
keep reminding yourself that

1187
00:43:14,093 --> 00:43:15,173
weddings are for the women.

1188
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:17,304
You're not supposed
to enjoy yourself, Doug.

1189
00:43:17,388 --> 00:43:19,265
If you were, there would
be big-screen TVs,

1190
00:43:19,348 --> 00:43:20,391
there would be gambling.

1191
00:43:20,474 --> 00:43:21,600
There's none of that there.

1192
00:43:21,684 --> 00:43:23,894
Okay, NAS
and we won't get caught.

1193
00:43:23,978 --> 00:43:25,396
Wait, what?

1194
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:27,606
NAS, Doug.

1195
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,859
Nod and smile.
All right? Let's go.

1196
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:35,614
You all look good.

1197
00:43:36,865 --> 00:43:37,908
How are you, man?
Oh.

1198
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:42,705
And I said, well,
put the money in the bag.

1199
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:46,834
Hello.
Uh-oh. Showtime.

1200
00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:48,769
Now, is this guy also a pro?
Yeah!

1201
00:43:48,794 --> 00:43:50,212
No. This guy
is not a professional.

1202
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,382
Just kidding. I'm just kidding.

1203
00:43:54,008 --> 00:43:56,427
The moment Chris asked me
to be his best man,

1204
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:59,555
I sat down and I wrote
a pretty awesome speech.

1205
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:03,726
But I don't know. I think I'd
rather speak from the heart.

1206
00:44:05,144 --> 00:44:06,145
Oh, don't do that.

1207
00:44:06,228 --> 00:44:08,068
Don't you rip that paper up.
You never do that.

1208
00:44:09,857 --> 00:44:12,192
Uh, you know, when Chris...

1209
00:44:13,027 --> 00:44:15,529
When Chris and I
first met, we, um...

1210
00:44:17,406 --> 00:44:18,699
Uh, well...

1211
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:22,661
Chris and I have known
each other since, uh...

1212
00:44:26,332 --> 00:44:27,499
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

1213
00:44:29,543 --> 00:44:33,339
Chris and I, you know,
we did stuff together.

1214
00:44:37,468 --> 00:44:38,761
He's going to throw up
on the fucking bride.

1215
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:42,848
And, um, Chris has been
like a brother to me.

1216
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:46,101
Well, because
my real brother died.

1217
00:44:46,602 --> 00:44:49,021
No. Well, he didn't
die immediately.

1218
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:52,149
They revived him in the ambulance,
and then, he died later.

1219
00:44:52,566 --> 00:44:53,567
Is he serious?

1220
00:44:55,444 --> 00:44:56,779
Adolf Hitler
once said...

1221
00:44:56,862 --> 00:44:58,447
Holy fucking shit.

1222
00:44:59,073 --> 00:45:00,949
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh, God.

1223
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:02,201
I'm just going to...

1224
00:45:02,284 --> 00:45:05,788
There was this one thing
I wanted to reference.

1225
00:45:06,455 --> 00:45:09,458
You know what? Fuck it.
Wolverines, brother!

1226
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:11,543
I love you. Thank you.

1227
00:45:11,627 --> 00:45:13,128
That's not
even the right way.

1228
00:45:13,212 --> 00:45:14,963
It's not an exit.

1229
00:45:15,756 --> 00:45:17,841
Okay. One, two...

1230
00:45:19,218 --> 00:45:21,011
♪ Ain't no mountain
high enough ♪

1231
00:45:21,095 --> 00:45:22,971
Are you okay?
Yeah.

1232
00:45:23,305 --> 00:45:25,140
Let's go dance.
No, thanks.

1233
00:45:25,307 --> 00:45:27,393
Douglas, you can hide
a fat ass in baggy pants,

1234
00:45:27,476 --> 00:45:28,936
but you cannot
hide a bad dancer.

1235
00:45:29,019 --> 00:45:30,145
Come on,
I'll teach you some basics.

1236
00:45:30,229 --> 00:45:31,397
I'm not dancing.

1237
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,357
It is my job to make you look
good on your wedding day.

1238
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,525
Now, I need you
to get comfortable

1239
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:36,485
with being uncomfortable.
Come on.

1240
00:45:37,361 --> 00:45:39,238
Stop being a pussy.
Let's dance.

1241
00:45:44,493 --> 00:45:45,494
Come on, you lead.

1242
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:46,829
No, I don't want to lead.

1243
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:48,539
Okay, then, fine,
be the chick, Doug.

1244
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:51,291
On second thought, I will lead.
Whatever, Doug.

1245
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:52,855
Just follow me.
I really don't get it.

1246
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:03,220
Back.

1247
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:07,224
Nice rond de jambe.
Thanks.

1248
00:46:08,475 --> 00:46:09,768
Twelve years of
dance lessons.

1249
00:46:09,852 --> 00:46:11,979
My mom said, "One day,
they would come in handy."

1250
00:46:12,271 --> 00:46:13,939
I doubt this is
what she had in mind.

1251
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:16,762
You asked how
a gal like Gretchen

1252
00:46:16,817 --> 00:46:18,193
could fall for
a yutz like me.

1253
00:46:18,444 --> 00:46:19,653
I took her dancing.

1278
00:47:48,575 --> 00:47:49,826
Hey!

1279
00:47:53,205 --> 00:47:56,750
So, I get a call out of
nowhere, a guy I went to school with.

1280
00:47:56,917 --> 00:47:58,835
I barely even knew the kid.

1281
00:47:58,919 --> 00:48:02,422
He goes,
"I just got engaged."

1282
00:48:02,631 --> 00:48:05,801
Naturally, I go, "Great.
Congratulations."

1283
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:10,514
Then, he says,
"Can you be my best man?"

1284
00:48:10,597 --> 00:48:12,140
I barely knew the kid.

1285
00:48:12,224 --> 00:48:14,309
Wow, that is so weird.

1286
00:48:14,393 --> 00:48:16,687
So, I get to thinking, "What's
the worst that can happen?"

1287
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:19,648
The guy's wedding party
consisted of me,

1288
00:48:20,566 --> 00:48:22,150
the bride's brother,

1289
00:48:22,651 --> 00:48:25,153
and this Filipino
exchange student.

1290
00:48:25,612 --> 00:48:27,531
And it was so sad, Doug.

1291
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:30,075
Everybody is thinking,
"Why in the hell"

1292
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:32,327
"would this woman
marry this loser?"

1293
00:48:32,411 --> 00:48:35,914
So, I grab the microphone and
I just get to talking about

1294
00:48:35,998 --> 00:48:40,669
how we climbed the Himalayas,
how we fished for sharks,

1295
00:48:41,003 --> 00:48:43,839
how this guy saved me in
a barroom brawl one time.

1296
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:45,340
So much bullshit.

1297
00:48:45,674 --> 00:48:50,012
And I look over and I see the bride.
She's got his arm, Doug.

1298
00:48:50,095 --> 00:48:53,140
She's got his arm so tight
and she's glowing.

1299
00:48:53,515 --> 00:48:56,018
Because she's marrying
this amazing guy.

1300
00:48:56,101 --> 00:48:59,104
This man comes up
to me and goes, "Wow."

1301
00:49:00,022 --> 00:49:01,857
"I would pay money"

1302
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:05,027
"to have somebody talk like
that about me at my wedding."

1303
00:49:06,194 --> 00:49:07,362
Light bulb.

1304
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:11,491
That's the day that this
wedding hustle was born.

1305
00:49:11,575 --> 00:49:14,536
That's the day that I
became The Wedding Ringer.

1306
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:23,045
I, uh...

1307
00:49:23,128 --> 00:49:27,215
Now, I don't want you to think
that I'm some sort of schmuck

1308
00:49:27,299 --> 00:49:28,842
who doesn't have
any friends.

1309
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:29,926
No.

1310
00:49:30,052 --> 00:49:31,637
You know, my father,

1311
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,639
he was an international
tax attorney, right?

1312
00:49:33,722 --> 00:49:35,974
So, we moved around
all the time.

1313
00:49:37,351 --> 00:49:40,312
I went to 13 different
schools by the eighth grade.

1314
00:49:40,395 --> 00:49:42,064
I lived on four
different continents.

1315
00:49:42,189 --> 00:49:44,733
And after a while
I just figured,

1316
00:49:45,651 --> 00:49:47,277
"Why even make
friends anymore?"

1317
00:49:47,736 --> 00:49:50,364
"I'm just going to have to move, anyway.
What's the point?"

1318
00:49:50,864 --> 00:49:55,452
And then, when my dad died,
I took over the business.

1319
00:49:56,078 --> 00:49:59,081
I was just working so much.
I was working too much.

1320
00:50:00,499 --> 00:50:02,209
Am I a loser?

1321
00:50:04,169 --> 00:50:05,253
No.

1322
00:50:06,421 --> 00:50:08,061
This is what you have
to understand, Doug.

1323
00:50:10,258 --> 00:50:12,386
Some people are just loners.

1324
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:15,097
It's that simple, man.

1325
00:50:16,223 --> 00:50:17,933
Maybe I don't
want to be.

1326
00:50:18,183 --> 00:50:21,436
Maybe I just want someone
to grab a beer with,

1327
00:50:23,188 --> 00:50:26,566
to go on
a cool guy trip with.

1328
00:50:27,651 --> 00:50:29,444
You've never been
on a guy trip, Doug?

1329
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:34,741
Cabo, Cancun, spring break? You've
never done anything like that?

1330
00:50:35,075 --> 00:50:37,369
I never really had
anyone to go with.

1331
00:50:45,377 --> 00:50:46,795
Good night, Tonto.

1332
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:49,965
I gotta say,
it feels really good

1333
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:51,591
to have somebody
looking out for me.

1334
00:50:51,883 --> 00:50:53,135
I got your back, man.

1335
00:50:53,343 --> 00:50:56,805
I like that.
And I got your back, too.

1336
00:51:03,145 --> 00:51:04,479
Hey, Doug.

1337
00:51:04,855 --> 00:51:06,857
I like you, man.
I think you're a great guy.

1338
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:09,583
I just want you to remember that
this is a business relationship.

1339
00:51:09,776 --> 00:51:11,403
It doesn't mean that we're
going to be best friends.

1340
00:51:11,486 --> 00:51:12,904
That's not how
this story ends.

1341
00:51:13,488 --> 00:51:15,782
I'm just an employee with a job to do.
I get it.

1342
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:19,119
You're not my best friend.
You're just my best man.

1343
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:20,620
In one week,
Bic will be on a plane

1344
00:51:20,704 --> 00:51:22,080
headed back to
the Middle East.

1345
00:51:22,164 --> 00:51:24,666
Three months from now, he'll get
killed in a tragic: grenade accident

1346
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:27,669
while giving an impromptu
sermon on the back of a Humvee.

1347
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:32,132
It doesn't mean that we're not
going to have a good time, Doug.

1348
00:51:32,215 --> 00:51:33,925
I said I got it.

1349
00:51:34,134 --> 00:51:38,221
You're anybody's best friend for a
price, but nobody's when it counts.

1350
00:51:57,199 --> 00:51:59,039
Is everything okay?
What's the matter with you?

1351
00:52:00,243 --> 00:52:01,328
I don't know.

1352
00:52:02,537 --> 00:52:03,747
Well, now.

1353
00:52:04,498 --> 00:52:07,000
I never expected
the "Jimmy Callahan"

1354
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:09,544
to get all soft-eyed
over a client.

1355
00:52:09,628 --> 00:52:12,047
No, no, it's not like that.

1356
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:14,382
All I do is go
from job to job,

1357
00:52:14,466 --> 00:52:16,218
saving these losers
with no friends.

1358
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:17,385
Losers?

1359
00:52:18,428 --> 00:52:19,721
Come on, Jimmy.

1360
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:24,643
They're not losers.
They're just guys.

1361
00:52:26,228 --> 00:52:29,147
They don't share their private,
deep emotional feelings

1362
00:52:29,231 --> 00:52:30,565
with each other
like women do.

1363
00:52:31,274 --> 00:52:32,442
Women are nurturers.

1364
00:52:32,901 --> 00:52:35,570
We sit and listen to
each other's problems.

1365
00:52:36,238 --> 00:52:38,031
Which is why we're
always so miserable,

1366
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:40,242
from all that
goddamn listening.

1367
00:52:40,325 --> 00:52:42,953
You should
count your blessings.

1368
00:52:44,329 --> 00:52:45,914
I still think
they're losers.

1369
00:52:46,248 --> 00:52:49,501
Well, maybe you're right. But
let me ask you this, Jimmy.

1370
00:52:50,252 --> 00:52:53,129
If you ever found a woman
crazy enough to marry you,

1371
00:52:54,923 --> 00:52:57,008
who would be your best man?

1372
00:53:01,596 --> 00:53:06,142
See, this all started because you
wanted to make a guy feel good.

1373
00:53:07,811 --> 00:53:10,522
Do you remember how good you felt
the first time you did this?

1374
00:53:11,648 --> 00:53:13,316
Well, you've lost that.

1375
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:17,070
You've become jaded
with all your rules.

1376
00:53:17,279 --> 00:53:20,407
You forgot what got you into this
business in the first place.

1377
00:53:21,366 --> 00:53:23,702
Your ability to be a friend,

1378
00:53:24,828 --> 00:53:26,621
to change someone's life.

1379
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:33,587
Now, Jimmy,
we have less than a week

1380
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:36,131
to pull off
the first ever Golden Tux.

1381
00:53:36,715 --> 00:53:39,467
So, I'm going to need you to
stop crying like a little girl,

1382
00:53:39,551 --> 00:53:40,802
strap on a pair,

1383
00:53:40,886 --> 00:53:43,722
stop wasting time
feeling sorry for yourself,

1384
00:53:43,805 --> 00:53:45,807
and let's bring
this shit home.

1385
00:53:51,771 --> 00:53:53,565
Doug Harris, right?
Uh, yeah.

1386
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:54,928
Come here, you little shit.
Wait!

1387
00:53:54,941 --> 00:53:56,701
Have you ever been to the 'hood?
Here you go.

1388
00:53:57,444 --> 00:54:00,322
Somebody help me! I'm not Doug Harris!

1389
00:54:00,405 --> 00:54:01,698
Why did you kick me
in my balls?

1390
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:03,408
Help me! No!

1391
00:54:03,491 --> 00:54:04,868
Throw his ass in the truck!

1392
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:06,119
Get back there!

1393
00:54:06,244 --> 00:54:07,454
Go, go, go!

1394
00:54:10,415 --> 00:54:12,417
I'm not strapped in!

1395
00:54:13,668 --> 00:54:15,128
What was that?
Shit!

1396
00:54:17,339 --> 00:54:19,716
Oh, God, which way
is the sidewalk?

1397
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:21,509
Doug, don't move!

1398
00:54:29,351 --> 00:54:32,896
Someone help me!
Please, God! Please!

1399
00:54:33,355 --> 00:54:34,940
I'm begging you!

1400
00:54:37,651 --> 00:54:38,818
Help!

1401
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,238
Anybody!

1402
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:54,459
Take his pants off!

1403
00:54:56,419 --> 00:54:57,712
You pay for the Golden Tux,

1404
00:54:57,796 --> 00:54:59,556
you get a bachelor party,
you son of a bitch!

1405
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:05,553
To the house!
Don't pop that shit!

1406
00:55:13,895 --> 00:55:15,605
Hey. Hi.

1407
00:55:15,689 --> 00:55:16,940
Oh.
Nadia.

1408
00:55:17,399 --> 00:55:19,484
Hi. I'm Doug. Doug Harris.

1409
00:55:22,445 --> 00:55:23,780
Do you speak English?

1410
00:55:23,947 --> 00:55:25,240
Oh.

1411
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:26,825

Oh, this is happening.
Shh!

Okay, so,
here's the deal.

1415
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:34,165
I'm about to get married to

1416
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:36,584
Oh! Gee!

We got through this already.

1455
00:57:19,771 --> 00:57:21,773
You smell so sweet.

1456

Ohh!

1457
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:25,485

nutty butter!

Nadia, you don't
have to do this.

give me a fletcher.

1463
00:57:41,751 --> 00:57:43,545
Okay, this shit's gone far enough!

1464
00:57:46,506 --> 00:57:47,966
Oh, Nadia, no!

1465
00:57:48,758 --> 00:57:51,302
Oh, God, it feels so good,
but I don't want you to.

1466
00:57:51,386 --> 00:57:52,470
Talk me through it, Doug!

1467
00:57:52,554 --> 00:57:55,223
It feels so scruffy and wet.

1468
00:57:55,974 --> 00:57:58,726
Why are you
licking so rapidly?

1469
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:00,728
I love my fiancée,
I love my fiancée.

1470
00:58:00,812 --> 00:58:02,188
How does that feel?

1471
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:11,239
Oh, God! Okay! Okay!

1472
00:58:17,245 --> 00:58:18,329
Oh, shit!

1473
00:58:19,497 --> 00:58:20,874
When you pull, it hurts!

1474
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,585
Stick a finger in his ass!

1475
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:25,461
Not my ass,
the dog's ass!

1476
00:58:25,545 --> 00:58:27,172
- It's not working!
- Get it off!

1477
00:58:31,134 --> 00:58:33,178
What the fuck, Plunkett?
Oh, shit.

1478
00:58:33,261 --> 00:58:35,263
I didn't shoot him. I shot up.
That dog is dead.

1479
00:58:36,598 --> 00:58:37,758
I just
tried to scare him off.

1480
00:58:37,807 --> 00:58:39,127
Shit, the fucking dog
has lockjaw.

1481
00:58:39,142 --> 00:58:40,185
It must have had
a heart attack.

1482
00:58:40,268 --> 00:58:42,937
There's a
dead dog on my dick.

1483
00:58:43,313 --> 00:58:44,713
I've got to get
to a hospital, guys.

1484
00:58:44,772 --> 00:58:45,892
His dick is bleeding!

1485
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,025
The hospital's right
around the corner, okay?

1486
00:58:47,108 --> 00:58:48,109
You have to hold on.

1487
00:58:48,276 --> 00:58:49,277
Hurry up, Lou.

1488
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,279
Every time it moves,
it hurts!

1489
00:58:51,362 --> 00:58:53,156
Where's the alcohol?
Somebody give me the alcohol!

1490
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:54,282
Just breathe, Dougie!

1491
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:55,491
That just burns!

1492
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:57,493
Whoa, whoa!
Red light, red light!

1493
00:58:59,787 --> 00:59:01,789
- What the fuck was that?
- Was that a cop?

1494
00:59:01,873 --> 00:59:02,957
No, it was just a cab.

1495
00:59:05,001 --> 00:59:06,419
Shit! We have open
bottles in here.

1496
00:59:06,502 --> 00:59:09,380
I can't go back to jail!
I'm tired of fucking dudes!

1497
00:59:09,464 --> 00:59:11,424
You were the rapist?
Finish your bottles!

1498
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:13,551
Everybody, chill out!
Put the bottles down,

1499
00:59:13,635 --> 00:59:15,511
put your drugs away.
Do you hear me?

1500
00:59:15,637 --> 00:59:17,180
This is Marci's
father's van.

1501
00:59:17,263 --> 00:59:18,264
I'm only 15!

1502
00:59:19,432 --> 00:59:20,516
Pullover.

1503
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,352
Lou, you have to pull
the fucking car over.

1504
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:23,853
Pull the fucking car over.

1505
00:59:23,937 --> 00:59:25,730
Oh, God,
Marci's going to kill me.

1506
00:59:25,855 --> 00:59:27,023
You're going to
get through this, man.

1507
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:28,107
This isn't going to be long.

1508
00:59:28,191 --> 00:59:29,484
Get me
out of the car.

1509
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:31,194
They're going to think
I kidnapped this white girl.

1510
00:59:31,319 --> 00:59:33,112
Take it. Take the gun. I don't
want this motherfucker, man.

1511
00:59:33,196 --> 00:59:34,239
No! You take it back.

1512
00:59:34,322 --> 00:59:35,922
Shush! Shut up.
You talk too much.

1513
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:37,367
I don't want it.
Take it.

1514
00:59:37,825 --> 00:59:40,453
Put it in your titties. I'm
not going to jail for this.

1515
00:59:41,037 --> 00:59:42,705
I can still see it.

1516
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:46,542
Shut up! This is real!
Everybody look normal. Okay?

1517
00:59:55,718 --> 00:59:57,011
Have you guys been
drinking tonight?

1518
00:59:57,095 --> 00:59:58,513
No, sir.

1519
01:00:00,473 --> 01:00:01,599
Not even a little bit?

1520
01:00:01,683 --> 01:00:02,725
No.

1521
01:00:07,897 --> 01:00:09,774
Are you all right, sir?
Uh-huh.

1522
01:00:09,857 --> 01:00:10,900
Is that a dog?

1523
01:00:13,027 --> 01:00:14,946
Yeah. Why is his mouth
on your genitals?

1524
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,657
Oh, God.

1525
01:00:23,705 --> 01:00:25,373
Lou, what the
fuck are you doing?

1526
01:00:25,456 --> 01:00:27,709
What in the fuck, Lou?

1527
01:00:30,211 --> 01:00:31,838
Stop the car, you old dick!

1528
01:00:33,423 --> 01:00:34,924
Lou, watch the Buick
on your right!

1529
01:00:37,427 --> 01:00:40,596
Do you have to hit
every single meter, Lou?

1530
01:00:42,181 --> 01:00:45,226
- Come on, what are you doing, Lou?
- No guts, no glory!

1531
01:00:47,937 --> 01:00:48,938
It's a one-way street!

1532
01:00:49,022 --> 01:00:50,222
I know!
It's the way I'm going!

1533
01:00:50,315 --> 01:00:51,941
- Look out!
- Stop the car!

1534
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,360
I hate you, Lou!

1535
01:00:55,403 --> 01:00:56,446
Fuck, Lou, stop!

1536
01:01:00,033 --> 01:01:01,117
Lou, this is a closed road!

1537
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,440
You're going
the wrong way, Lou!

1538
01:01:02,452 --> 01:01:04,495
I don't have a
fucking seat belt on, Lou!

1539
01:01:05,705 --> 01:01:08,750
Holy shit!
There's a gap in the bridge!

1540
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:13,129
We're all
going to die!

1541
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:14,255
Oh, my God!

1542
01:01:14,756 --> 01:01:16,507
No!

1543
01:01:29,645 --> 01:01:31,022
Oh, my God!

1544
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:32,345
We made it!

1545
01:01:33,066 --> 01:01:35,693
Yeah!
Suck on this, copper.

1546
01:01:43,326 --> 01:01:44,410
Nadia.

1547
01:01:44,911 --> 01:01:47,914
Hey. You waited
all night for me?

1548
01:01:49,582 --> 01:01:50,917
You know, last night,

1549
01:01:52,502 --> 01:01:54,504
that was the greatest night
of my entire life.

1550
01:01:56,923 --> 01:02:00,468
I don't think I've ever felt a
connection to anybody like that before.

1551
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:04,305
I know you can't
understand any of this.

1552
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:08,684
But I...
Tonto.

1553
01:02:09,102 --> 01:02:10,102
How is it hanging?

1554
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:12,397
I'm kind of numb.

1555
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,898
What did they do?

1556
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:15,566
Oh, they put some stitches
in your penis head.

1557
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:16,984
The doctor said
you'll be okay, though.

1558
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:18,194
Come on,
kiss her goodbye.

1559
01:02:19,862 --> 01:02:23,282
I've gotta go. It was really
great getting to know you.

1560
01:02:36,295 --> 01:02:38,381
It was great
getting to know you, too.

1561
01:02:40,508 --> 01:02:42,427
Wait. You speak English?

1562
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:44,178
Thanks for having me
out again, Jimmy.

1563
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:46,931
Doug here
is a real keeper.

1564
01:02:48,474 --> 01:02:51,269
Call me sometime. Maybe we
can catch a Dodger game.

1565
01:02:55,314 --> 01:02:57,233
"Dodger game" is
code-word for fucking.

1566
01:03:00,695 --> 01:03:01,737
Fellows.

1567
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:03,448
Where's Lou?

1568
01:03:03,531 --> 01:03:05,116
Lou had to go away
for a while.

1569
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:07,368
He said it was
worth it, though.

1570
01:03:10,705 --> 01:03:11,789
Burn this.

1571
01:03:16,919 --> 01:03:21,340
I haven't felt this good,
this happy since...

1572
01:03:21,424 --> 01:03:22,508
Since ever.

1573
01:03:22,758 --> 01:03:24,385
Did you take one of those pills
Plunkett was handing out?

1574
01:03:24,427 --> 01:03:26,345
The ones that looked like Altoids?
Yes! Did you take one?

1575
01:03:26,429 --> 01:03:27,909
Yeah, I took one.
What did I tell you?

1576
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:29,432
You said don't take anything
that looks like drugs.

1577
01:03:29,557 --> 01:03:31,350
Then why did you take it? Because
it looked like an Altoid.

1578
01:03:31,434 --> 01:03:32,477
It wasn't an Altoid, Doug.

1579
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,686
Nah, I realized that
soon after.

1580
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:36,439
I said, "Stay your ass away from
Plunkett." Didn't I tell you that?

1581
01:03:37,523 --> 01:03:39,233
Now, I know
none of this is real,

1582
01:03:39,317 --> 01:03:41,569
but it's good to be
one of the guys.

1583
01:03:41,777 --> 01:03:43,196
It really is.

1584
01:03:50,244 --> 01:03:52,205
Come on. Let's go get
you cleaned up, man.

1585
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:58,836
So, uh, let's just go and
knock this thing out, man.

1586
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,422
We'll make you look great,
rock your wedding,

1587
01:04:01,923 --> 01:04:05,676
send you off to Tahiti so you
can blow Gretchen's back out.

1588
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,428
Knock her back loose.

1589
01:04:07,512 --> 01:04:10,473
And then, we ship Father Bic
off to his untimely death.

1590
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:19,315
I was thinking about what you asked
me the other day about Gretchen.

1591
01:04:19,398 --> 01:04:20,399
Mmm-hmm.

1592
01:04:20,483 --> 01:04:23,361
And on our third date,
she said something

1593
01:04:23,444 --> 01:04:24,684
about wanting to
start a family,

1594
01:04:24,737 --> 01:04:26,030
how she was
ready to have kids.

1595
01:04:26,489 --> 01:04:28,950
And I don't know, ever
since I lost my family,

1596
01:04:30,243 --> 01:04:31,843
I've always wanted
to make one of my own.

1597
01:04:34,956 --> 01:04:36,165
Hey, do me a favor.

1598
01:04:36,249 --> 01:04:38,376
Be very gentle with my car.
I've seen your car...

1599
01:04:38,459 --> 01:04:40,044
Ain't nobody gonna
mess up this shit.

1600
01:04:40,127 --> 01:04:41,128
Okay.

1601
01:04:41,212 --> 01:04:42,588
Why don't you go put
some ice on your dick?

1602
01:04:42,672 --> 01:04:44,715
Yeah. No kidding,
right? God.

1603
01:04:46,008 --> 01:04:47,385
Hello.
I got a problem.

1604
01:04:47,468 --> 01:04:48,588
I can't be there
on Saturday.

1605
01:04:48,636 --> 01:04:49,804
What are you
talking about, Garv?

1606
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:51,514
Marci's dad found a butt plug
in the glove compartment.

1607
01:04:51,597 --> 01:04:52,640
She knows I'm working
with you again.

1608
01:04:52,723 --> 01:04:54,976
I had to promise to fix the kitchen
cabinets to get her to calm down.

1609
01:04:55,059 --> 01:04:56,269
No. You're going to be there.
Do you hear me?

1610
01:04:56,352 --> 01:04:58,229
I'll call Marci myself. Is
that what you want me to do?

1611
01:04:58,312 --> 01:04:59,397
I'll tell her about Kokomo.

1612
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,232
Lurch,
where are you?

1613
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:02,608
Look, Jimmy, come on.
No, don't "Look, Jimmy" me.

1614
01:05:02,692 --> 01:05:03,734
I'm not playing the
"Look, Jimmy" game.

1615
01:05:03,818 --> 01:05:05,194
No, we all made a pact.

1616
01:05:05,278 --> 01:05:07,358
You said the kitchen cabinets
would be done by today.

1617
01:05:07,363 --> 01:05:09,282
Just tell Marci that you'll do
the kitchen cabinets on Sunday.

1618
01:05:09,365 --> 01:05:10,992
Jimmy, go die in a fire!
I hate you.

1619
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:13,619
I hope your dick
gets chopped off.

1620
01:05:13,703 --> 01:05:15,246
Roger Delta Niner.

1621
01:05:15,329 --> 01:05:17,915
And may God bless
whoever else is on this.

1622
01:05:19,709 --> 01:05:22,128
Hey.
Who is Jimmy?

1623
01:05:23,713 --> 01:05:26,340
Jimmy is actually a tag.

1624
01:05:26,507 --> 01:05:27,800
It's a tag name.
Military code.

1625
01:05:27,883 --> 01:05:29,176
Military code?

1626
01:05:29,552 --> 01:05:31,512
So, I suppose
I shouldn't pry into

1627
01:05:31,596 --> 01:05:34,098
the meaning of "kitchen
cabinets" then, either.

1628
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:37,727
For your safety, no. I would
kind of leave it alone.

1629
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:40,062
All right, I'll see
you at the rehearsal dinner.

1630
01:05:40,146 --> 01:05:41,522
See you then.

1631
01:05:42,148 --> 01:05:43,899
Father.
Okay.

1632
01:05:45,318 --> 01:05:46,819
Oh, God.

1633
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:52,033
Six violins,
two violas, two cellos,

1634
01:05:52,283 --> 01:05:53,701
one contrabass,
one electric bass,

1635
01:05:53,784 --> 01:05:56,287
two guitars, one drum set,
and I'll be singing.

1636
01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:58,748
And your first dance
will be to what song?

1637
01:05:58,914 --> 01:06:01,667
To our song,
You Are So Beautiful.

1638
01:06:04,253 --> 01:06:06,464
That's by Joe Cooker.
Thanks.

1639
01:06:08,257 --> 01:06:10,259
What?
That's not our song.

1640
01:06:10,593 --> 01:06:12,219
That's not our song.

1641
01:06:12,303 --> 01:06:14,138
Honey, of course it is.

1642
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:15,598
No, it's not.

1643
01:06:15,681 --> 01:06:17,433
Yeah. Babe,
don't you remember?

1644
01:06:17,558 --> 01:06:20,978
Your broken CD player repeated
it over and over and over

1645
01:06:21,062 --> 01:06:22,563
the first time
we made love.

1646
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:24,815
Oh.
It was so amazing.

1647
01:06:25,941 --> 01:06:27,818
That wasn't me.

1648
01:06:27,902 --> 01:06:30,529
That was your ex, Steve.

1649
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:32,031
And I know that
because you've told me

1650
01:06:32,114 --> 01:06:34,075
this story about five times.

1651
01:06:34,784 --> 01:06:36,369
So...
Oh.

1652
01:06:38,913 --> 01:06:41,540
Well, you know, honey, it's
still such a beautiful song.

1653
01:06:41,624 --> 01:06:44,126
I mean, when you
really listen to the words.

1654
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:46,962
Honey, it's my favorite.
Please.

1655
01:06:50,383 --> 01:06:51,384
Sure.

1656
01:06:52,259 --> 01:06:53,511
Yay.

1657
01:06:53,594 --> 01:06:55,096
I'm going to need a deposit.

1658
01:06:55,596 --> 01:06:57,848
Gentlemen,
in these wallets,

1659
01:06:57,932 --> 01:07:00,643
you have a license,
credit cards,

1660
01:07:00,726 --> 01:07:04,146
and $300 cash.

1661
01:07:04,438 --> 01:07:05,981
These bags here
contain your suits

1662
01:07:06,065 --> 01:07:08,275
for the rehearsal dinner
as well as the wedding.

1663
01:07:08,359 --> 01:07:12,488
You guys get some rest. We leave
for the high school at 0800.

1664
01:07:13,155 --> 01:07:15,449
What are we doing
at the high school?

1665
01:07:18,953 --> 01:07:20,204
Hey, Dad.

1666
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:21,580
Don't ever call me Dad.

1667
01:07:21,831 --> 01:07:24,417
So, we were thinking maybe the
field's a little too muddy today.

1668
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,501
You sound like my daughters.

1669
01:07:25,584 --> 01:07:27,086
It doesn't get any
better than this, boys.

1670
01:07:27,169 --> 01:07:28,337
Come on, you pussies.

1671
01:07:28,713 --> 01:07:30,513
Okay. Yeah, all right.
All right. Sounds good.

1672
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:32,408
We're playing
these old guys?

1673
01:07:32,425 --> 01:07:34,802
Listen. Let's just keep it
fun, fellows, all right?

1674
01:07:34,885 --> 01:07:36,554
Go out here,
amuse these old geezers.

1675
01:07:36,637 --> 01:07:37,930
There's no need
to rub it in their faces.

1676
01:07:38,013 --> 01:07:39,390
We wouldn't want
to see any coronaries.

1677
01:07:39,515 --> 01:07:41,142
You boys look
a little soft.

1678
01:07:41,225 --> 01:07:42,425
That dude
looks familiar.

1679
01:07:43,227 --> 01:07:45,104
Are you sure you can
handle going both ways?

1680
01:07:45,187 --> 01:07:47,481
I heard Doug enjoys that.
What?

1681
01:07:49,483 --> 01:07:51,193
Sit, pal! Pussies!

1682
01:07:53,487 --> 01:07:54,989
He's open!

1683
01:07:55,156 --> 01:07:56,824
Chop block!
That's a chop block!

1684
01:07:56,991 --> 01:07:59,201
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Touchdown. Seven-zip.

1685
01:07:59,368 --> 01:08:01,495
I just got punched. I thought
this was touch football.

1686
01:08:01,662 --> 01:08:04,039
You can't play football
without blocking, bitch.

1687
01:08:04,165 --> 01:08:05,645
That old motherfucker
is fast as shit.

1688
01:08:05,666 --> 01:08:06,625
They just caught us
off guard.

1689
01:08:06,709 --> 01:08:07,918
Can we discuss
the rules again?

1690
01:08:08,002 --> 01:08:09,503
Come on, Doug, get up.
Good D!

1691
01:08:10,212 --> 01:08:11,672
It's Webster!

1692
01:08:12,006 --> 01:08:14,049
Those old guys
are fast and crazy, man.

1693
01:08:14,133 --> 01:08:16,010
This is Sean John, bitch!

1694
01:08:16,177 --> 01:08:17,845
Back on your side, loser.

1695
01:08:19,013 --> 01:08:20,097
You have a really
nice arm, sir.

1696
01:08:20,181 --> 01:08:21,724
Blow me, kid.
Oh...

1697
01:08:22,183 --> 01:08:24,518
Hut! Let's go, Doug!

1698
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:29,190
I don't have the ball!

1699
01:08:30,024 --> 01:08:31,025
Take that, gimp!

1700
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:32,359
You're so mean!

1701
01:08:32,526 --> 01:08:33,486
What the fuck?
I'm in a wheelchair!

1702
01:08:33,569 --> 01:08:35,112
He's in a wheelchair!

1703
01:08:35,196 --> 01:08:37,114
Hey, fat ass, we're going
to do your sister!

1704
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:38,407
I don't have a sister.

1705
01:08:38,491 --> 01:08:39,700
In the ass!

1706
01:08:41,202 --> 01:08:43,078
Blue dog left, Omaha!

1707
01:08:47,124 --> 01:08:48,542
Yeah!
Yeah, brother!

1708
01:08:48,626 --> 01:08:49,627
Shit.

1709
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:51,212
Why?

1710
01:08:53,798 --> 01:08:54,882
You're such a fucking
embarrassment.

1711
01:08:54,965 --> 01:08:56,685
Your father-in-law is a dick.

1712
01:08:56,717 --> 01:08:58,761
- Oh, God, 72 just bit me!
- All right, that's it.

1713
01:09:01,555 --> 01:09:02,890
Look at us.

1714
01:09:04,266 --> 01:09:07,227
Where'd you go to defense
school, Munchkinland?

1715
01:09:08,395 --> 01:09:09,980
Good one!

1716
01:09:10,481 --> 01:09:13,067
Fuck this, fellows.
Shit just got real.

1717
01:09:14,568 --> 01:09:16,278
Get up, guys.
We're about to give these

1718
01:09:16,362 --> 01:09:18,781
old bitches a nice
little serving of youth.

1719
01:09:18,864 --> 01:09:20,032
All right, ready!

1720
01:09:20,115 --> 01:09:21,242
Set. Hike! Let's go!

1721
01:09:23,744 --> 01:09:25,746
Go, go,
Dickerson! Yeah!

1722
01:09:27,915 --> 01:09:29,124
Old bitch!

1723
01:09:29,917 --> 01:09:31,752
Hut!

1724
01:09:34,588 --> 01:09:35,881
How does it feel?

1725
01:09:37,091 --> 01:09:38,592
- Fuck!
- Hike! Let's go!

1726
01:09:38,717 --> 01:09:40,344
Oh, God!

1727
01:09:45,307 --> 01:09:46,642
Hut one.

1728
01:09:46,725 --> 01:09:47,977
Fumble!

1729
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:50,020
I've got the ball!
I've got the ball!

1730
01:09:50,104 --> 01:09:51,772
This way, Doug!

1731
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:53,691
This way!
I've got the ball!

1732
01:09:53,774 --> 01:09:54,775
Go, go, go!

1733
01:09:55,025 --> 01:09:56,694
Keep going!

1734
01:10:05,786 --> 01:10:07,288
- Fumble!
- Fumble!

1735
01:10:09,832 --> 01:10:11,292
Dog pile!

1736
01:10:11,792 --> 01:10:14,295
Our ball! Our ball!
Our ball!

1737
01:10:14,461 --> 01:10:16,672
Okay, listen, y'all.

1738
01:10:18,549 --> 01:10:20,092
I'll be the first to say
that we underestimated

1739
01:10:20,134 --> 01:10:21,552
these old sons of bitches.

1740
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:23,721
Listen! Right now,
we are back in the game.

1741
01:10:23,804 --> 01:10:25,681
The next touchdown wins, guys.

1742
01:10:25,973 --> 01:10:27,725
Now, Doug, I gotta be
honest with you, man.

1743
01:10:27,808 --> 01:10:29,351
You played a pretty
shitty game.

1744
01:10:29,476 --> 01:10:30,978
And the last thing
I want to do is put

1745
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:32,980
the ball in your hands,
but I do know this.

1746
01:10:33,147 --> 01:10:34,627
I know that you're
faster than Big Ed.

1747
01:10:34,648 --> 01:10:36,901
I know that I can
throw you the ball.

1748
01:10:36,984 --> 01:10:39,704
But what I need to know is if you're
going to catch the goddamn ball.

1749
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:41,697
Hey, look at me.

1750
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:43,490
Please don't
throw me the ball.

1751
01:10:43,574 --> 01:10:45,826
- Doug, get off of me.
- Man, your father-in-law hates you.

1752
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:48,329
Listen, I will throw it to you and
you're going to catch it. Okay?

1753
01:10:48,412 --> 01:10:49,413
Get some fucking
balls right now!

1754
01:10:49,496 --> 01:10:50,496
You need this, Doug.

1755
01:10:50,539 --> 01:10:52,333
- Be a man.
- This isn't a game anymore.

1756
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:54,793
- Your father-in-law has no respect for you.
- Show him you're a man.

1757
01:10:54,877 --> 01:10:55,920
Be a goddamn man!

1758
01:10:56,003 --> 01:10:57,671
One, two, three.
Break!

1759
01:11:07,222 --> 01:11:08,390
Hike!

1760
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:54,728
Yeah!

1761
01:12:04,905 --> 01:12:06,323
Oh, my God.

1762
01:12:14,081 --> 01:12:16,125
How did you like
them apples?

1763
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:18,627
You can't spell "Ed"
without "Bitch"!

1764
01:12:18,794 --> 01:12:20,963
Whoa. Easy there.
That's going to be your dad.

1765
01:12:24,591 --> 01:12:26,468
I'm so happy
for you, man.

1766
01:12:28,762 --> 01:12:30,097
You're not a bitch!

1767
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:36,562
I told you
guys to be careful.

1768
01:12:36,645 --> 01:12:38,105
I knew someone would get hurt.
Look at this.

1769
01:12:38,188 --> 01:12:39,690
Well, to be fair,
we were just having fun

1770
01:12:39,773 --> 01:12:40,933
until your dad
and his friends

1771
01:12:40,941 --> 01:12:42,693
decided to make it
an MMA blood sport.

1772
01:12:42,776 --> 01:12:44,987
- Don't pin this shit on me.
- Hey, hey, now.

1773
01:12:45,195 --> 01:12:46,447
Hey!

1774
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:48,574
Oh, my God. Who the
hell are those guys?

1775
01:12:48,657 --> 01:12:50,617
What are you talking about?
Those are my friends.

1776
01:12:50,701 --> 01:12:53,078
That's Principal
Mitchell Rambis from Utah.

1777
01:12:53,495 --> 01:12:55,622
In the wheelchair,
that's Plunkett.

1778
01:12:55,831 --> 01:12:58,792
And that's the brilliant
philosopher, Ira Drysdale.

1779
01:12:59,126 --> 01:13:00,419
No. No, no.

1780
01:13:00,502 --> 01:13:02,254
That's the strangest
looking group

1781
01:13:02,337 --> 01:13:04,006
of guys I've ever
seen in my life.

1782
01:13:04,089 --> 01:13:06,633
What do you mean? Those are my boys.
What's up, man?

1783
01:13:06,717 --> 01:13:08,010
How are you doing, Doug?

1784
01:13:08,093 --> 01:13:11,221
My, this has been a long
time coming, hasn't it?

1785
01:13:11,305 --> 01:13:12,473
Palmers,
it's an honor.

1786
01:13:12,556 --> 01:13:14,391
Mrs. Palmer, I see
where Gretchen gets her

1787
01:13:14,475 --> 01:13:15,976
good looks.

1788
01:13:16,685 --> 01:13:17,728
Thank you.

1789
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:19,396
Gretchen.
Yes.

1790
01:13:20,397 --> 01:13:21,732
Oh.

1791
01:13:22,483 --> 01:13:24,568
It's a pleasure finally meeting
the love of Doug's life.

1792
01:13:24,651 --> 01:13:26,987
Thank you. Hey, Grandma...
What the...

1793
01:13:27,071 --> 01:13:28,906
Oh, wait, Bic,
I meant to tell you,

1794
01:13:28,989 --> 01:13:30,109
Grandma made
a full recovery.

1795
01:13:30,115 --> 01:13:31,825
She's doing really well.
Doesn't she look good, guys?

1796
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,160
Yeah.

1797
01:13:33,827 --> 01:13:36,580
That's something else to look at there.
It's very pretty.

1798
01:13:41,668 --> 01:13:43,003
What are you doing?
Nothing.

1799
01:13:43,253 --> 01:13:45,506
What are you feeding him? Oh,
what are you talking about?

1800
01:13:47,674 --> 01:13:50,344
That. He wasn't like that
until you showed up.

1801
01:13:52,012 --> 01:13:53,092
That's the Doug
that I know.

1802
01:13:53,097 --> 01:13:54,556
I've never seen
that Doug before.

1803
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:58,227
Hi, everyone.
Hi. I'm Holly Munk.

1804
01:13:58,435 --> 01:13:59,937
I'm the head bridesmaid.

1805
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:01,480
Twenty bucks says
they wrote a song.

1806
01:14:01,605 --> 01:14:03,774
$40 says it's The Carpenters.
You're on.

1807
01:14:03,857 --> 01:14:04,900
You're on.

1808
01:14:04,983 --> 01:14:05,983
You're onner.

1809
01:14:06,026 --> 01:14:07,778
You're on first.
You're more on.

1810
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:10,280
You're on from God.

1811
01:14:10,364 --> 01:14:11,657
You're never going to
believe this, Gretch,

1812
01:14:11,782 --> 01:14:14,034
but we wrote you a little ditty.

1813
01:14:14,535 --> 01:14:17,621
Yes. And if everyone wants
to look under your seats,

1814
01:14:17,704 --> 01:14:18,914
you're going to
find the lyrics

1815
01:14:18,997 --> 01:14:20,917
so that everybody can sing along.

1816
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:24,044
And we're singing
to the tune of

1817
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:25,921
Lean on Me.

1818
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:27,297
Pay up, Father.

1819
01:14:27,381 --> 01:14:28,799
I don't have any cash.
I only have credit.

1820
01:14:28,882 --> 01:14:31,844
Do you take credit cards?
Oh, no, I only take cash.

1821
01:14:31,927 --> 01:14:33,595
Oh, excuse me, Ms. Maid of Honor.
What?

1822
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:34,888
Are you going to chat
all night or are you

1823
01:14:34,972 --> 01:14:36,515
going to come up
and sing with us?

1824
01:14:36,557 --> 01:14:38,976
Do you think you're too good?
No, this is your guys' thing.

1825
01:14:39,143 --> 01:14:40,144
What, do you
think you're too pretty?

1826
01:14:40,227 --> 01:14:41,353
God always wins.

1827
01:14:41,436 --> 01:14:43,689
That's why you're going up there.
God is a winner.

1828
01:14:43,939 --> 01:14:45,899
Let's go, bitch. Come on.

01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:30,861
we decided to put together
a little slide show

to toast our buddy.

1844

buddy.

He also taught us things

01:16:02,976 --> 01:16:04,478
Climbing the glaciers

1859
01:16:04,561 --> 01:16:05,771
of Patagonia.
Hmm.

1860
01:16:08,315 --> 01:16:11,151
Jumping out of a plane at 10,000 feet.

1861
01:16:14,821 --> 01:16:16,657
Help him out, guys.
You got it?

1862
01:16:18,575 --> 01:16:19,576
Yeah.

1863
01:16:19,993 --> 01:16:22,496
After I was hit
by a drunk driver

1864
01:16:22,579 --> 01:16:24,373
who was found innocent,

1865
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:28,418
it was Doug
who helped me pay

1866
01:16:28,502 --> 01:16:29,795
for my law school tuition.

1867
01:16:29,878 --> 01:16:30,879
Aw.

1868
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:32,673
That's so sweet.

1869
01:16:32,756 --> 01:16:33,840
It was you.

1870
01:16:38,929 --> 01:16:39,972
That's okay.

1871
01:16:40,055 --> 01:16:41,848
The only thing that
gets hard is my nipples.

1872
01:16:42,015 --> 01:16:43,225
Oh, dear.

1873
01:16:43,767 --> 01:16:45,352
Let's get him out of here.

1874
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:46,635
Way to keep it
together, buddy.

1875
01:16:46,728 --> 01:16:47,813
I wanted to quit
grad school

1876
01:16:47,896 --> 01:16:49,606
until Doug told me
the story of Plunkett.

1877
01:16:49,856 --> 01:16:51,316
Which inspired me to stay.

1878
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,440
- Aw.
- He inspired us all.

1879
01:16:52,484 --> 01:16:54,736
When he wasn't
hitting those books,

1880
01:16:54,861 --> 01:16:57,072
old Doug-town was teaching
us all how to have fun.

1881
01:16:57,155 --> 01:16:58,782
- Yeah, he was.
- Doug-man.

1882
01:17:00,242 --> 01:17:01,785
I think we saved
the best for last.

1883
01:17:01,868 --> 01:17:03,620
This last shot is
actually my favorite.

1884
01:17:04,538 --> 01:17:07,624
This was a historic guy trip
with my closest friend.

1885
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:09,459
As you can see
in this picture

1886
01:17:09,543 --> 01:17:10,711
and in all
the other pictures,

1887
01:17:11,086 --> 01:17:13,130
Doug is smiling,

1888
01:17:14,047 --> 01:17:15,924
but I think we can
all agree that in this shot,

1889
01:17:16,008 --> 01:17:17,759
that smile got
a whole lot brighter.

1890
01:17:19,219 --> 01:17:20,262
I love you, bud.

1891
01:17:27,894 --> 01:17:30,522
I was a bit surprised
when I met your groomsmen.

1892
01:17:30,605 --> 01:17:33,567
I mean, actually, terrified.
Like, "Wah! What is that?"

1893
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:35,819
But I've got to say,
they're really good guys.

1894
01:17:36,403 --> 01:17:37,821
I mean... Oops.

1895
01:17:41,491 --> 01:17:43,243
Honey, are you there?

1896
01:17:46,913 --> 01:17:49,113
I'm definitely going to
have Alison be my maid of honor.

1897
01:17:49,124 --> 01:17:50,667
I mean, no one
can fight over that.

1898
01:17:50,751 --> 01:17:53,253
But, babe, what about you? Who's
going to be your best man?

1899
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:54,504
Uh...

1900
01:17:56,048 --> 01:17:58,967
Mitchum. Bic Mitchum.

1901
01:17:59,426 --> 01:18:00,510
Who?

1902
01:18:00,594 --> 01:18:02,679
You know Bic. Bic Mitchum.

1903
01:18:02,929 --> 01:18:04,056
He's a buddy of mine
from Stanford.

1904
01:18:04,139 --> 01:18:06,058
No, I've never heard
of Bic Mitchum.

1905
01:18:06,433 --> 01:18:08,935
Didn't you meet Bic at that...
I met Bic?

1906
01:18:09,019 --> 01:18:11,579
You know, maybe on second thought,
you didn't meet Bio because...

1907
01:18:11,605 --> 01:18:13,815
Because why?
He's overseas,

1908
01:18:13,899 --> 01:18:16,443
uh, in the military.

1909
01:18:17,069 --> 01:18:20,072
Oh, you know what?
Now that you mention it...

1910
01:18:20,155 --> 01:18:22,282
I think you have said
something about him.

1911
01:18:22,366 --> 01:18:23,825
Isn't he a priest
or something?

1912
01:18:24,618 --> 01:18:27,871
Yeah. That's right.
Yeah, I knew it.

1913
01:18:27,954 --> 01:18:29,956
He's a priest overseas
in the military.

1914
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:33,251
But our
Wedding's in 10 days.

1915
01:18:33,335 --> 01:18:34,503
But Bic's still in...

1916
01:18:34,711 --> 01:18:37,381
Uh, El Salvador.

1917
01:18:37,464 --> 01:18:38,632
Bic is flying in
tomorrow morning.

1918
01:18:38,715 --> 01:18:40,384
In April I was in the Middle East.
Muffin juice.

1919
01:18:40,467 --> 01:18:42,010
Bring him to lunch with you. No!

1920
01:18:42,344 --> 01:18:43,970
I am...

1921
01:18:44,054 --> 01:18:45,097
Oh, my God!

1922
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:46,932
...dying to
finally meet this guy.

1923
01:18:49,267 --> 01:18:50,769
I'm dying to finally
meet all your friends.

1924
01:18:50,811 --> 01:18:52,854
Who the hell are those guys?
Those are my friends.

1925
01:18:52,979 --> 01:18:56,108
I am still missing the
groomsmen's information.

1926
01:18:56,525 --> 01:18:57,651
Those are
the strangest group of guys

1927
01:18:57,734 --> 01:18:58,985
I've ever seen in my life.

1928
01:18:59,528 --> 01:19:00,570
Your friends
are gonna be there.

1929
01:19:00,654 --> 01:19:01,974
My friends are
all gonna be there.

1930
01:19:06,535 --> 01:19:07,911
Sweetie.

1931
01:19:07,994 --> 01:19:09,413
Hey-Hon?

1932
01:19:11,832 --> 01:19:12,916
Gretchen, are you there?

1933
01:19:12,999 --> 01:19:14,000
Doug-

1934
01:19:14,167 --> 01:19:15,919
Don't you think
it's a bit strange

1935
01:19:16,002 --> 01:19:19,714
that you use Bic razors
and Mitchum deodorant,

1936
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,509
and your best man's
name is Bic Mitchum?

1937
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:28,223
Well, if your best friend
was named Jemima Colgate,

1938
01:19:28,306 --> 01:19:29,850
I bet you wouldn't
use Log Cabin syrup

1939
01:19:29,933 --> 01:19:31,435
or Aquafresh toothpaste,
would you?

1940
01:19:32,269 --> 01:19:33,854
It's called loyalty.

1941
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:36,440
Hey, sweetie, listen,
you're just overstressed.

1942
01:19:36,606 --> 01:19:38,150
Why don't you get some sleep?
I'll see you tomorrow

1943
01:19:38,233 --> 01:19:40,277
for our big day. Okay?

1944
01:19:41,695 --> 01:19:42,988
Okay, bye.

1945
01:19:43,071 --> 01:19:44,364
Bye, sweetie.

by her window

1948

"it's called loyalty."

1954
01:20:13,727 --> 01:20:15,145
I didn't teach you that.

1955
01:20:15,228 --> 01:20:17,397
No, that can't be taught.
You're born with that.

1956
01:20:17,481 --> 01:20:18,899
You look good, man.

1957
01:20:18,982 --> 01:20:20,822
Thank you. I wish I could
say the same for you.

1958
01:20:22,152 --> 01:20:24,738
So, you know,
as I'm getting dressed,

1959
01:20:24,905 --> 01:20:29,159
I'm thinking to myself how
insane what we're doing is.

1960
01:20:29,326 --> 01:20:31,328
You just started
thinking that?

1961
01:20:31,411 --> 01:20:33,914
Well, I mean,
she's going to be my wife.

1962
01:20:34,956 --> 01:20:36,750
Shouldn't I be able
to tell her the truth?

1963
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:38,293
I mean, the key
to relationships

1964
01:20:38,376 --> 01:20:39,544
is being honest, you know?

1965
01:20:39,753 --> 01:20:41,004
Up to a point.

1966
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:44,257
It's all about making
her happy, Doug. All right?

1967
01:20:44,466 --> 01:20:46,635
Come on.
Let's go get you married.

1968
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:48,011
Ah.

1969
01:20:48,178 --> 01:20:49,763
You look good, man.

1970
01:21:00,148 --> 01:21:04,944

1972
01:21:07,697 --> 01:21:08,782
Hey, fellows.

1973
01:21:09,616 --> 01:21:10,992
Gather around.

1974
01:21:11,493 --> 01:21:14,287
Hey, hey. Guys, guys.

1975
01:21:14,621 --> 01:21:15,705
This is one of
the few times that

1976
01:21:15,789 --> 01:21:17,332
you're actually going
to hear me be honest.

1977
01:21:17,457 --> 01:21:19,657
Nine days ago, I didn't think
a Golden Tux was possible.

1978
01:21:20,043 --> 01:21:21,378
But in less than an hour,
we're going to have

1979
01:21:21,461 --> 01:21:22,712
200 unsuspecting guests

1980
01:21:22,796 --> 01:21:24,965
filling those pews to celebrate
some holy matrimony.

1981
01:21:25,048 --> 01:21:28,260
Which means that from this moment
on, we are flawless, gentlemen.

1982
01:21:28,343 --> 01:21:29,427
Have each other's
backs out there.

1983
01:21:29,511 --> 01:21:30,637
Support each other.

1984
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,389
Remember your HW2's,
your boomerangs,

1985
01:21:32,472 --> 01:21:33,807
and your Party Trick
Distractions.

1986
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:35,642
Drysdale, set it off.
What time is it?

1987
01:21:35,725 --> 01:21:36,810
It's game time!

1988
01:21:36,893 --> 01:21:38,144
I said,
what time is it?

1989
01:21:38,228 --> 01:21:39,938
It's game time!

1990
01:21:40,814 --> 01:21:42,649
Guys, guys,
I'm down here. Guys.

1991
01:21:44,859 --> 01:21:46,987
Douglas! Hi!
Perfect timing.

1992
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:49,155
I was just telling
Papa Bear here

1993
01:21:49,239 --> 01:21:52,284
that we did have a little
bit of a "scandal"

1994
01:21:52,367 --> 01:21:53,827
with Father O'Brien.

1995
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:55,954
He will not be able to
officiate the wedding.

1996
01:21:56,288 --> 01:21:57,368
But it's okay.
Rest assured,

1997
01:21:57,414 --> 01:21:58,873
I have everything
under control

1998
01:21:58,957 --> 01:22:00,750
because Father McNulty here,

1999
01:22:00,834 --> 01:22:02,669
he has agreed to step

2000
01:22:02,752 --> 01:22:04,588
as a replacement
of the shoes

2001
01:22:04,671 --> 01:22:05,755
of Father O'Brien.

2002
01:22:05,839 --> 01:22:07,841
Hello, Doug.
Hi. Great to meet you.

2003
01:22:08,008 --> 01:22:10,218
Father McNulty is
a wonderful priest.

2004
01:22:10,385 --> 01:22:12,429
I'm just happy the big day's finally
here, to be honest with you.

2005
01:22:12,512 --> 01:22:13,805
I would love for you
to meet all my friends.

2006
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,181
This is my best man, Bic.

2007
01:22:16,182 --> 01:22:20,186
Uh, Bic must have
gone a different way.

2008
01:22:20,353 --> 01:22:21,938
Uh, would you guys mind
going to look for Bic?

2009
01:22:22,022 --> 01:22:24,107
I'd love for him to be
caught up on all this.

2010
01:22:24,274 --> 01:22:25,874
I'm going to go
see if he's praying.

2011
01:22:26,401 --> 01:22:27,444
What is going on?

2012
01:22:27,527 --> 01:22:28,653
What the hell is
Father McNulty doing here?

2013
01:22:28,737 --> 01:22:30,071
How do you know
Father McNulty?

2014
01:22:30,196 --> 01:22:31,781
Because he was my principal
at Benjamin Rush.

2015
01:22:31,865 --> 01:22:34,117
I spent half my damn middle school
years in his principal's office.

2016
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,453
Please, please tell me
that you are kidding me.

2017
01:22:36,536 --> 01:22:38,913
This cannot be happening right now.
I need you to fix this.

2018
01:22:38,997 --> 01:22:40,040
What you want me to do?
If I go out there,

2019
01:22:40,123 --> 01:22:41,458
he knows I'm not
Bic Mitchum.

2020
01:22:41,541 --> 01:22:45,045
Shh! Wait. Wait.
I think I have an idea.

2021
01:22:53,053 --> 01:22:54,888
Father McNulty?
Yes.

2022
01:22:56,306 --> 01:22:57,557
Go, go, go.

2023
01:23:01,561 --> 01:23:02,729
Oh, shit!

2024
01:23:02,896 --> 01:23:04,481
200 grand out the door,

2025
01:23:04,564 --> 01:23:06,900
I expect...
No, I demand perfection.

2026
01:23:06,983 --> 01:23:08,485
Yes, Mr. Palmer,
I assure you...

2027
01:23:08,568 --> 01:23:09,944
Listen, Menudo,
first you tell me

2028
01:23:10,028 --> 01:23:11,655
my family priest
is a goddamn pervert.

2029
01:23:11,738 --> 01:23:13,907
Now you tell me Father
McNulty has disappeared.

2030
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:15,825
Mr. Palmer,
I'll take care of this.

2031
01:23:15,909 --> 01:23:17,702
You better or I will
fuck you up.

2032
01:23:56,658 --> 01:23:57,992
Shall we do this?

2033
01:23:59,619 --> 01:24:02,372
Do you, Gretchen Palmer,

2034
01:24:02,622 --> 01:24:06,418
take Douglas Ephraim
Ben Lazar Menahem Harris

2035
01:24:06,626 --> 01:24:08,670
to be your lawfully
wedded husband,

2036
01:24:09,003 --> 01:24:11,339
to have and to hold,

2037
01:24:11,673 --> 01:24:14,050
through sickness
and health,

2038
01:24:14,134 --> 01:24:15,301
till death do you part?

2039
01:24:15,468 --> 01:24:16,469
I do.

2040
01:24:18,221 --> 01:24:23,059
Do you, Douglas Ephraim
Ben Lazar Menahem Harris,

2041
01:24:23,143 --> 01:24:24,728
take Gretchen Palmer

2042
01:24:24,811 --> 01:24:26,271
to be your lawfully
wedded wife,

2043
01:24:27,188 --> 01:24:29,858
to have and to hold,

2044
01:24:30,233 --> 01:24:33,486
through sickness and health,
till death do you part?

2045
01:24:35,238 --> 01:24:36,281
I do.

2046
01:24:43,163 --> 01:24:46,207
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

2047
01:24:46,624 --> 01:24:48,835
You
may now kiss the bride.

2048
01:24:50,336 --> 01:24:53,381
Aw. Ladies and
gentlemen, I present to you

2049
01:24:53,465 --> 01:24:55,341
Mr. and Mrs. Harris.

2050
01:24:59,554 --> 01:25:01,306
You are about to
blow that back out.

2051
01:25:01,389 --> 01:25:02,766
Don't do this here.
Don't do that.

2052
01:25:02,849 --> 01:25:04,184
What?
Nothing.

2053
01:25:11,024 --> 01:25:13,234
I'm a lounge singer myself
up there in Canada.

2054
01:25:13,318 --> 01:25:14,402
What kind of
stuff do you sing?

2055
01:25:14,486 --> 01:25:17,030
That's when I knew I was
born to work on feet.

2056
01:25:17,363 --> 01:25:19,741
You're a podiatrist?
I'm a podiatrist.

2057
01:25:24,662 --> 01:25:25,705
Big deal.

2058
01:25:25,789 --> 01:25:27,040
Where did you
go to school?

2059
01:25:27,207 --> 01:25:28,208
Uh...

2060
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,251
You don't remember?

2061
01:25:30,627 --> 01:25:32,170
Harvard.
I went to Harvard.

2062
01:25:32,253 --> 01:25:34,293
I'm really inspired by black,
American soul singers.

2063
01:25:34,297 --> 01:25:35,632
Nice.
Like Tom Jones.

2064
01:25:35,882 --> 01:25:37,522
You went to Harvard Podiatry School?
Yeah.

2065
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:39,219
What years?
20.

2066
01:25:39,302 --> 01:25:40,386
20?

2067
01:25:43,223 --> 01:25:45,475
Oh, wow.
You work out, huh?

2068
01:25:45,558 --> 01:25:46,810
Isn't Tom Jones white?

2069
01:25:46,893 --> 01:25:48,228
Yeah, isn't he
from Wales?

2070
01:25:51,231 --> 01:25:52,565
Mom!

2071
01:25:52,732 --> 01:25:54,234
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Oh, my God.

2072
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,736
- Well, do you want to see?
- Boom.

2073
01:25:56,903 --> 01:25:58,863
Yeah, three balls.
Count them.

2074
01:26:01,032 --> 01:26:02,659
I thought you said
you was a vegan.

2075
01:26:05,370 --> 01:26:06,871
Okay, that's cool.

2076
01:26:06,955 --> 01:26:08,623
I can do it, too.
Stop.

2077
01:26:09,916 --> 01:26:10,916
That's mine.

2078
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,002
I'm proud of you, Doug. I really am.
Well, thank you, sir.

2079
01:26:13,086 --> 01:26:14,712
I have to say,
I learned from the master.

2080
01:26:14,796 --> 01:26:16,631
Hey, well,
don't celebrate yet.

2081
01:26:16,714 --> 01:26:18,633
We still have
more work to do.

2082
01:26:18,716 --> 01:26:20,476
All right, I'm going
to wait for you outside.

2083
01:26:21,553 --> 01:26:23,513
Ugh. Can you believe this zipper
already broke? Okay, I'm coming.

2084
01:26:23,596 --> 01:26:26,116
Mrs. Harris, can I talk to you for
a second? I'll get the thing.

2085
01:26:26,266 --> 01:26:28,434
Uh, listen,
I may be partial here,

2086
01:26:28,518 --> 01:26:29,727
but I just want to say
that you have put on

2087
01:26:29,811 --> 01:26:31,020
the perfect wedding.
Really.

2088
01:26:31,104 --> 01:26:32,397
Perfect wedding?

2089
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:35,066
The zipper on my
$8,000 dress is broken,

2090
01:26:35,191 --> 01:26:36,943
the groomsmen are
accosting my bridesmaids,

2091
01:26:37,026 --> 01:26:39,821
my grandmother's burned from head
to toe, my dad's knee is shredded.

2092
01:26:39,904 --> 01:26:41,944
And don't even get me started
on the salad dressing.

2093
01:26:42,574 --> 01:26:45,285
But at least you have Doug.
True love conquers all.

2094
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:46,619
True love?

2095
01:26:46,703 --> 01:26:49,122
Please. I'm just sick
of dating assholes.

2096
01:26:49,205 --> 01:26:51,499
Doug is a good guy,
he's good family material.

2097
01:26:51,583 --> 01:26:52,625
What can I say?
I'm a girl

2098
01:26:52,709 --> 01:26:54,043
that's used to a certain
kind of lifestyle,

2099
01:26:54,127 --> 01:26:55,461
and Doug can give me
that kind of lifestyle.

2100
01:26:55,545 --> 01:26:57,463
So, I've gotta go.

2101
01:27:01,926 --> 01:27:04,262
Bud, are you waiting on me?
Yeah. Yes.

2102
01:27:05,805 --> 01:27:07,891
Let's, uh, get back out there, huh?
Yeah.

2103
01:27:07,974 --> 01:27:10,268
Time for the first dance.
Yes, it is.

I'm not sure I know

2114
01:28:00,276 --> 01:28:02,904
There has just been some

over the last
couple of days.

2116

Of course, she loves you.

Why would you even say that?

I overheard the two of you
talking, okay?

2135

You have to understand that.
It doesn't matter.

I don't love her, either.

2139

I love the idea that
a girl who looks that hot

could like me.

I couldn't believe it. But
she's not "the one," Jimmy.

2142
01:29:07,593 --> 01:29:08,928
She's not even
"the two"

2143
01:29:09,012 --> 01:29:10,304
or "the three,"
for that matter.

2144
01:29:10,555 --> 01:29:11,973
Doug, nine days ago,
you came to me

2145
01:29:12,056 --> 01:29:13,433
and you asked me
to pull off a miracle.

2146
01:29:13,516 --> 01:29:14,517
Right now,
we're 30 minutes away

2147
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:15,760
from pulling off
a Golden Tux.

2148
01:29:15,768 --> 01:29:17,353
I know. But then what?

2149
01:29:17,437 --> 01:29:19,022
Then I go back to
living what turns out

2150
01:29:19,105 --> 01:29:21,649
was a pretty lonely life. I
don't want that life anymore.

2151
01:29:22,108 --> 01:29:23,526
I don't want to be that guy.

2152
01:29:23,609 --> 01:29:24,944
Doug, you have to
calm down.

2153
01:29:25,028 --> 01:29:26,237
Everything is going
to be all right.

2154
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,865
I don't want it
to be all right.

2155
01:29:28,948 --> 01:29:30,616
I want it to be great.

2156
01:29:30,783 --> 01:29:32,744
I want my real life to be

2157
01:29:32,827 --> 01:29:34,370
as fun as the one I paid for.

2158
01:29:34,454 --> 01:29:36,539
No shit, Doug.

2159
01:29:36,622 --> 01:29:38,458
You don't think
I want that? Hmm?

2160
01:29:38,916 --> 01:29:41,044
You don't think I want to
be a Delta Air Line pilot

2161
01:29:41,127 --> 01:29:42,336
or the CFO of Lubriderm

2162
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:43,921
or whatever the hell
else I made up,

2163
01:29:44,005 --> 01:29:46,841
instead of being some guy that works
out of a renovated fucking closet?

2164
01:29:46,924 --> 01:29:48,009
You don't think
I would ask Alison

2165
01:29:48,092 --> 01:29:49,612
to come out and have
a burrito with me?

2166

Me? With Jimmy Callahan?

2167
01:29:51,387 --> 01:29:53,473
Or say, "Hey, Doug, come on,
let's go have a beer next week."

2168
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:54,807
"Maybe we can catch a game."

2169
01:29:54,891 --> 01:29:57,102
I want to do all of
that shit, but I can't.

2170
01:29:57,185 --> 01:29:59,065
Because I can't go out
there and tell the truth.

2171
01:29:59,145 --> 01:30:01,189
Because you need Bic.

2172
01:30:03,274 --> 01:30:04,734
Nobody needs Jimmy, man.

2173
01:30:04,817 --> 01:30:08,112
Okay? Not a single soul
needs Jimmy.

2174
01:30:08,613 --> 01:30:10,990
That's reality, Doug.

2175
01:30:11,324 --> 01:30:13,576
I'm going to go out here and
I'm going to make my toast,

2176
01:30:13,659 --> 01:30:15,244
and me and you,
we are done here.

2177
01:30:15,328 --> 01:30:17,288
We're done.

2178
01:30:17,371 --> 01:30:19,540
I suggest you get your
head back in the game.

2179
01:30:19,624 --> 01:30:21,000
It's showtime.

2180
01:30:27,673 --> 01:30:31,135
♪ If you believed in me ♪

2181
01:30:32,136 --> 01:30:34,806
Good evening. My name
is Bic Mitchum,

2182
01:30:34,889 --> 01:30:36,224
and, uh,
I just want to say

2183
01:30:36,307 --> 01:30:38,184
that it's an honor
to be here.

2184
01:30:38,643 --> 01:30:40,144
I've delivered many sermons,

2185
01:30:40,228 --> 01:30:41,813
but never
a best man's speech,

2186
01:30:41,896 --> 01:30:43,189
so, please bear with me.

2187
01:30:44,607 --> 01:30:46,234
Doug and I have been
through a lot together.

2188
01:30:46,317 --> 01:30:48,778
Happy times and sad.

2189
01:30:48,861 --> 01:30:50,113
When I was accepted
into the priesthood,

2190
01:30:50,196 --> 01:30:52,615
Doug was there waiting
for me with a huge hug

2191
01:30:52,698 --> 01:30:55,118
and a Bible that was
signed by Cardinal Enders.

2192
01:30:55,201 --> 01:30:56,953
And when his parents,
Merle and Irene,

2193
01:30:57,036 --> 01:30:58,704
passed,
God rest their souls,

2194
01:30:59,372 --> 01:31:00,581
I cried as if
they were my own.

2195
01:31:01,791 --> 01:31:03,459
You know, my grandmother
once told me

2196
01:31:03,543 --> 01:31:06,712
that the true measure
of friendship isn't...

2197
01:31:08,214 --> 01:31:10,550
Isn't how you feel
about someone else.

2198
01:31:12,718 --> 01:31:16,055
It's about how they make
you feel about yourself.

2199
01:31:18,349 --> 01:31:19,475
And, uh...

2200
01:31:20,685 --> 01:31:23,813
I can honestly say that
I've never had a friend

2201
01:31:23,896 --> 01:31:26,399
to make me feel the way
that you have, Doug.

2202
01:31:29,235 --> 01:31:30,903
Uh...

2203
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:37,660
Um...

2204
01:31:45,418 --> 01:31:47,044
I'm sorry. Uh...

2205
01:31:50,548 --> 01:31:54,093
When Doug called me and told
me that he wanted to propose,

2206
01:31:56,012 --> 01:31:59,849
I was nervous. I was probably
just as nervous as he was.

2207
01:32:01,017 --> 01:32:03,102
And I remember asking him,

2208
01:32:04,854 --> 01:32:06,939
"Are you sure
she's 'the one'?"

2209
01:32:12,737 --> 01:32:13,738
Damn it.

2210
01:32:16,115 --> 01:32:17,158
He told me he, uh...

2211
01:32:17,241 --> 01:32:18,242
Stop!

2212
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:23,080
What are you doing?
Just, uh, stop.

2213
01:32:25,291 --> 01:32:26,792
I don't know.

2214
01:32:27,376 --> 01:32:28,669
Doug.

2215
01:32:33,132 --> 01:32:34,425
What are you doing, Doug?

2216
01:32:34,508 --> 01:32:37,136
Are you sure that you want
to go through with this?

2217
01:32:37,303 --> 01:32:39,305
Thanks, Jimmy.
I've got it from here.

2218
01:32:41,349 --> 01:32:45,019
Hi. I've got
something to say.

2219
01:32:45,937 --> 01:32:48,147
None of this is real.

2220
01:32:48,356 --> 01:32:49,690
Ooh.
Uh-oh.

2221
01:32:50,608 --> 01:32:51,776
What?

2222
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:54,654
See, although
the flowers are beautiful

2223
01:32:54,737 --> 01:32:57,490
and the salad
dressing is great,

2224
01:32:57,823 --> 01:32:59,116
we're not married,

2225
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:00,826
Gretchen and I.

2226
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:02,160
We can't be

2227
01:33:02,203 --> 01:33:04,789
because my friend Bic
is not a priest.

2228
01:33:05,581 --> 01:33:06,916
Oh, shit, here we go.

2229
01:33:06,999 --> 01:33:08,918
Yeah. In fact, he's not
even in the Army.

2230
01:33:09,001 --> 01:33:10,503
His real name is Jimmy,

2231
01:33:10,586 --> 01:33:12,296
and I hired him
to be my best man

2232
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:14,257
because I had
no other options.

2233
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:15,800
Same with all my groomsmen.

2234
01:33:15,883 --> 01:33:18,261
I actually don't even know
their real last names.

2235
01:33:18,344 --> 01:33:19,929
Bronstein.
...is Japanese.

2236
01:33:20,096 --> 01:33:22,265
It's good to meet you guys.
So, please stay

2237
01:33:22,348 --> 01:33:23,933
and enjoy the cake.

2238
01:33:26,018 --> 01:33:27,103
What do we do now?

2239
01:33:27,186 --> 01:33:28,437
We need to get
the fuck out of here.

2240
01:33:28,521 --> 01:33:29,605
Yeah.
Great stuff tonight.

2241
01:33:29,689 --> 01:33:30,731
Thank you so much, bud.

2242
01:33:31,357 --> 01:33:33,401
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

2243
01:33:35,861 --> 01:33:37,280
Look, Gretch,
who were we kidding?

2244
01:33:37,363 --> 01:33:39,123
You didn't grow up
dreaming of a guy like me.

2245
01:33:39,198 --> 01:33:41,659
Your knight is out there somewhere.
Go find him.

2246
01:33:41,826 --> 01:33:43,577
I'm going to
tear your head off.

2247
01:33:43,828 --> 01:33:45,955
You goddamn motherfucking
pathetic piece of shit.

2248
01:33:46,038 --> 01:33:47,707
Señor, let's just relax. Get
out of my way, you fairy.

2249
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:49,030
Fairy?

2250
01:33:52,169 --> 01:33:54,171
- Love you, Dougie!
- Calm down.

2251
01:33:54,463 --> 01:33:56,173
You motherfuckers!

2252
01:33:56,257 --> 01:33:57,883
I swear to God...

2253
01:34:02,346 --> 01:34:03,472
What the fuck?

2254
01:34:03,556 --> 01:34:04,890
I will cut you!

2255
01:34:05,641 --> 01:34:06,726
Shit, man.

2256
01:34:07,351 --> 01:34:09,979
Good game, kid. That
was a hell of a catch.

2257
01:34:10,062 --> 01:34:11,063
Oh.

2258
01:34:11,188 --> 01:34:12,189
All right. Thanks.

2259
01:34:12,648 --> 01:34:14,775
Hey. No ass-touching
off the field, Joe.

2260
01:34:14,859 --> 01:34:16,485
I knew you were
full of shit

2261
01:34:16,569 --> 01:34:17,778
from the moment I met you.

2262
01:34:17,862 --> 01:34:19,864
I know this is gonna sound crazy,
but if you're ever in the mood,

2263
01:34:19,947 --> 01:34:21,282
I know a place that
has great burritos.

2264
01:34:21,365 --> 01:34:22,491
You just ruined
my sister's wedding

2265
01:34:22,575 --> 01:34:23,784
and you're asking me
out on a date?

2266
01:34:23,868 --> 01:34:25,244
Yes, I am.
Can I call you?

2267
01:34:26,912 --> 01:34:28,247
Yeah, you better.
I will.

2268
01:34:28,748 --> 01:34:29,749
Oh.

2269
01:34:35,629 --> 01:34:37,548
We were
this close, Doug.

2270
01:34:37,631 --> 01:34:39,175
Yeah, well,
maybe next time.

2271
01:34:39,342 --> 01:34:40,343
Yeah.

2272
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:41,761
Oh.

2273
01:34:42,053 --> 01:34:43,054
Here.

2274
01:34:44,847 --> 01:34:46,390
You saved me, Jimmy.

2275
01:34:46,474 --> 01:34:48,184
Yeah, well,
you saved me, too.

2276
01:34:48,434 --> 01:34:50,227
Did you mean what
you said back there?

2277
01:34:51,604 --> 01:34:52,646
Am I really your friend?

2278
01:34:53,314 --> 01:34:54,690
Yeah, of course I meant it.

2279
01:34:56,442 --> 01:34:58,319
Does that mean you
don't want my money?

2280
01:34:58,402 --> 01:35:00,654
Fuck yeah, I want this money.
I earned this money, man.

2281
01:35:00,738 --> 01:35:01,864
Damn it.

2282
01:35:01,947 --> 01:35:03,616
So, what the hell
do we do now?

2283
01:35:03,783 --> 01:35:05,868
You still have those two first-class
tickets for your honeymoon?

2284
01:35:05,951 --> 01:35:07,787
Yeah, why?
I've got an idea.

2285
01:35:08,287 --> 01:35:11,332
This is going to be the best
honeymoon ever!

2286
01:35:11,582 --> 01:35:13,626
Ever honeymoon best
the be to going is this!

2287
01:35:13,959 --> 01:35:15,002
Cheers, my friend.

2288
01:35:15,086 --> 01:35:16,087
To your first guy trip.

2289
01:35:16,295 --> 01:35:17,463
Mmm. I'll drink to that.

2290
01:35:18,798 --> 01:35:20,216
Everyone, please,

2291
01:35:20,299 --> 01:35:22,301
I need you to
take your seats.

2292
01:35:22,468 --> 01:35:24,303
Please fasten
your seat belts.

2293
01:35:24,929 --> 01:35:26,806
Can I unfasten
my pants belt?

2294
01:35:27,264 --> 01:35:28,391
Oh.

2295
01:35:30,184 --> 01:35:31,894
Oh, hello. Would you mind
holding this for a second?

2296
01:35:31,977 --> 01:35:33,729
Yes, Doug.
Thank you so much.

2297
01:35:33,813 --> 01:35:35,272
Oh, no. Okay.

2298
01:35:35,564 --> 01:35:36,565
Oh.

2299
01:35:40,653 --> 01:35:42,905
Oh! Hi, there!

2300
01:35:43,781 --> 01:35:45,825
You like that,
don't you?

2301
01:35:46,117 --> 01:35:48,077
Is that a dog? You can't
have a dog on the plane.

2302
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:49,286
This? No,
it's a service dog.

2303
01:35:49,370 --> 01:35:50,746
That's a service dog, man.

2304
01:35:50,830 --> 01:35:52,081
Let me show you what type
of service it can do.

2305
01:35:52,415 --> 01:35:53,582
Somebody send up
the peanut butter!

2306
01:35:53,666 --> 01:35:55,026
No! No peanut butter!
