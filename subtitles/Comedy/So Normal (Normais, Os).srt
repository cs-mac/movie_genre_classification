1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,609
You wanna see me?
Sorry there was rock on me.

2
00:00:02,729 --> 00:00:04,496
You were getting
a hot-oil massage.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,566
My imagination will not be held
prisoner to my lazy body. Bryan,

4
00:00:07,617 --> 00:00:09,534
what if I told you
the gardener found your puppy

5
00:00:09,569 --> 00:00:10,685
in the bottom of the pool?

6
00:00:10,703 --> 00:00:12,170
That he sank
like a Fluffy stone?

7
00:00:12,205 --> 00:00:13,354
Oh, my God, no!

8
00:00:13,372 --> 00:00:15,307
Just kidding.
The puppy's fine.

9
00:00:15,341 --> 00:00:17,025
Perspective, baby.
I wanted you to see

10
00:00:17,043 --> 00:00:21,012
to see how bad it <i>could</i> be
when you saw this.

11
00:00:21,047 --> 00:00:24,382
This is a rare wormley sofa
I bought at auction.

12
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:26,034
I outbid James Franco just so

13
00:00:26,052 --> 00:00:27,919
I could see his neck vein
throbbing in sexy frustration!

14
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,087
Who would do something
like this?

15
00:00:29,138 --> 00:00:31,306
I bet it was
that damn surrogate's kid.

16
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,391
See, this is why
my people spank.

17
00:00:33,426 --> 00:00:34,760
Is this what
having children means?

18
00:00:34,811 --> 00:00:37,679
That I have to give up all
the beautiful things in my life?

19
00:00:37,713 --> 00:00:39,047
I have OCD, you know.

20
00:00:39,065 --> 00:00:40,215
Obsessive Chic Disorder.

21
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:41,566
Bryan, maybe

22
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:43,401
it's a good thing
Goldie's pee test was negative.

23
00:00:43,436 --> 00:00:45,070
If you and David have a baby,

24
00:00:45,104 --> 00:00:46,738
this is gonna be your lives
for 18 years.

25
00:00:46,773 --> 00:00:49,241
Maybe you're not ready
for such a brutal change.

26
00:00:49,275 --> 00:00:51,409
Also, I need a raise.

27
00:00:51,444 --> 00:00:52,577
Hey, rocky.
Bryan, come on.

28
00:00:52,612 --> 00:00:54,029
We're going to be late
to meet Goldie.

29
00:00:54,063 --> 00:00:55,447
David, look at this.
Look at this!

30
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:57,699
Look what that miniature
Sally Jesse Raphael did!

31
00:00:57,733 --> 00:00:59,734
Is that you? He does
make that face.

32
00:00:59,752 --> 00:01:01,569
(Gasps) David: Come on.
Shania's a kid.

33
00:01:01,587 --> 00:01:03,071
Kids do stuff like this.

34
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:05,257
Obviously, if we're
going to have a baby,

35
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,958
our lives are going
to change a lot.

36
00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:09,261
Wait! I thought
rent-a-belly turned out

37
00:01:09,295 --> 00:01:11,746
not to be in the gay family way.

38
00:01:11,764 --> 00:01:14,049
Now, is she, or isn't she?

39
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:17,752
Why are you both looking at me like that?
'Cause you're a doctor.

40
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,254
The negative
we got could just be

41
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:21,223
'cause it was too early
for a urine test.

42
00:01:21,257 --> 00:01:25,277
But this blood test
detects the HCG hormone,

43
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:28,263
which is the one that we want,
a week after conception.

44
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:29,731
(Buzzer sounding)

45
00:01:29,765 --> 00:01:32,317
Bryan,

46
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:34,435
are you mad at me
'cause my pee test was negative?

47
00:01:34,453 --> 00:01:35,654
No, honey.

48
00:01:35,705 --> 00:01:37,572
Your daughter colored
on my fancy couch,

49
00:01:37,606 --> 00:01:39,241
and frankly,
I'm having a moment.

50
00:01:39,275 --> 00:01:41,293
She did what?! I'm so sorry.

51
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:44,412
I'll pay to have it cleaned. My couch
was an exquisite leather antique.

52
00:01:44,446 --> 00:01:47,332
Now we'll just think of it as
judi dench with a tramp-stamp.

53
00:01:47,383 --> 00:01:49,301
I'll knit you an Afghan to cover it up.
Please don't.

54
00:01:49,335 --> 00:01:50,836
Now, look,
we love watching Shania

55
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:52,804
while you get settled
into your new place.

56
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:55,290
She is very well behaved.
I'm sure there's an explanation.

57
00:01:55,308 --> 00:01:56,842
Yeah. I'll talk to her
when I get home.

58
00:01:56,893 --> 00:01:58,560
No. You know what?

59
00:01:58,594 --> 00:02:00,846
Why don't we have Bryan talk
to her?

60
00:02:00,897 --> 00:02:03,014
Ooh. It'll be good practice
for when he's a dad.

61
00:02:03,065 --> 00:02:05,016
I feel so bad about this.
Oh, please don't.

62
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:07,986
Don't. I'm used to living
with imperfection.

63
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,804
Do you see how this side of my
face is degrees more handsome

64
00:02:09,822 --> 00:02:10,638
than this side?

65
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:11,857
This side? This side?

66
00:02:11,908 --> 00:02:13,325
I don't see it.
I'm so sorry.

67
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:14,976
I know! Identically handsome!

68
00:02:14,994 --> 00:02:17,145
(Laughter)

69
00:02:17,163 --> 00:02:20,365
Do you think Shania's acting out
by drawing on your couch?

70
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,200
Am I a terrible mom? No. No.

71
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:25,120
No! You are
a terrific mom.

72
00:02:25,154 --> 00:02:27,372
Yeah. Okay? You're doing
all this for her.

73
00:02:27,423 --> 00:02:30,008
Don't play with the buzzer.

74
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:32,878
My God, miss pepper,
you look stunning today.

75
00:02:32,929 --> 00:02:34,796
Can you please get the
results of these samples

76
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,847
as soon as possible?

77
00:02:35,882 --> 00:02:37,015
(Laughs)

78
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:38,884
I wouldn't rush it
if I were you.

79
00:02:38,935 --> 00:02:42,137
Thing comes back
positive, jig's up.

80
00:02:42,171 --> 00:02:44,890
Your life won't belong to you anymore.
No, no, no.

81
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:46,107
See, that is the thing

82
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:48,310
that people do not understand
about parenting.

83
00:02:48,344 --> 00:02:50,228
It is all about setting limits.

84
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:52,814
You are in charge.

85
00:02:52,848 --> 00:02:55,400
Your life will only change
as much as you let it.

86
00:02:55,451 --> 00:02:56,868
(Women laughing hysterically)

87
00:02:56,903 --> 00:02:59,371
Yeah, that's good.

88
00:02:59,405 --> 00:03:02,407
You are hilarious.

89
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,075
Goldie:
That made me feel better.

90
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:07,009

91
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:09,197
I'm sorry to bother you,
sir, but when you're done,

92
00:03:09,215 --> 00:03:10,632
could you please
check the toilet?

93
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,717
It's stopped up.
But not, um, from me.

94
00:03:12,752 --> 00:03:14,886
I bet the hombre
that lived here before you

95
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:16,755
tried to flush his stash.

96
00:03:16,806 --> 00:03:18,256
Oh, not you, amigo.

97
00:03:18,307 --> 00:03:20,208
There's a bad bean
in every burrito.

98
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:21,593
Nana...

99
00:03:21,644 --> 00:03:23,211
I drove 2,200 miles

100
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:24,562
to get away from your opinions.

101
00:03:24,597 --> 00:03:26,547
Please, just go.

102
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:28,350
You are my granddaughter,

103
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,936
and I am not going anywhere
without you and the kid.

104
00:03:30,987 --> 00:03:33,688
I'll just stay in
the best Western.

105
00:03:33,722 --> 00:03:36,358
It's the cleanest place
in the whole filthy city.

106
00:03:36,392 --> 00:03:38,393
The entire state should be
wrapped in a condom.

107
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:41,529
(With accent): Grey gardens has
fallen into absolute disrepair.

108
00:03:41,563 --> 00:03:43,231
Don't be embarrassed,

109
00:03:43,249 --> 00:03:47,085
mother darling. Living in
squalor absolutely becomes you.

110
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,453
What's with the lunatic?

111
00:03:48,504 --> 00:03:51,072
Oh. She watched a documentary
called <i>grey gardens</i>

112
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,791
about a-a crazy
mother and daughter

113
00:03:52,842 --> 00:03:54,409
living in a crumbling house.

114
00:03:54,427 --> 00:03:55,927
And now she's pretending
to be one of them.

115
00:03:55,962 --> 00:03:58,913
Goldie, you have got
to get goggles home.

116
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:01,933
This <i>is</i> home now.
No, don't say that anymore.

117
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:03,802
Your daughter has no business

118
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:06,471
spending time
with those candy packers

119
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:09,057
in that sodom and gomorrah
fudge factory!

120
00:04:09,091 --> 00:04:11,059
Do you know that when
I went to pick her up

121
00:04:11,093 --> 00:04:13,445
earlier... because
I am the only one

122
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,113
in this family
that owns a car...

123
00:04:15,147 --> 00:04:17,615
I was blinded by gay.

124
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,451
<i>Those fruits are like</i>
<i>cannibals.</i>

125
00:04:19,485 --> 00:04:21,403
<i>All they eat is fruit.</i>

126
00:04:21,437 --> 00:04:23,905
<i>And you will never guess what</i>
<i>I found in the powder room.</i>

127
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:26,658
You mind? Are you sure you're even
supposed to be using this one?

128
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:28,276
If I could get up now,

129
00:04:28,294 --> 00:04:30,445
I would knock you
on your pterodactyl ass.

130
00:04:30,463 --> 00:04:32,063
<i>But those bugle blowers saved</i>

131
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:34,232
<i>the real kicker</i>
<i>for their bedroom.</i>

132
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:36,251
(Screaming echoing)

133
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:38,336
When I was a girl,
we studied presidents

134
00:04:38,387 --> 00:04:41,089
who <i>owned</i> people
like this president.

135
00:04:41,123 --> 00:04:43,458
There are plenty
of lovely people in the world.

136
00:04:43,476 --> 00:04:46,961
I just don't happen
to be related to any of them.

137
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:48,646
She's a freakin' nut job!

138
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:50,482
She can hear you!

139
00:04:50,516 --> 00:04:52,183
Please, just go!

140
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:55,186
Fine.

141
00:04:55,221 --> 00:04:57,138
Just let me know
if you're pregnant.

142
00:04:57,156 --> 00:04:59,974
I'd like to send a
congratulations card...

143
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:02,861
To Satan.

144
00:05:02,912 --> 00:05:04,362
(Phone plays tune)

145
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:07,198
It's been more than an hour,
so my pizza's free.

146
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:08,199
It's me.

147
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,284
Oh, Nana, thank God.

148
00:05:09,318 --> 00:05:10,285
Did you make Goldie
love me again?

149
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,453
Stop whining!

150
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:13,154
Grow a pair, put on pants,

151
00:05:13,172 --> 00:05:14,822
get on a plane,

152
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,459
and stop your lady
from screwing up her life.

153
00:05:17,493 --> 00:05:20,128
Yeah, what do I do
about my pizza?

154
00:05:20,162 --> 00:05:22,263
What is up?
Your sucky suck game sucks

155
00:05:22,298 --> 00:05:23,515
more than you usually suck.

156
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:25,383
Yeah? I'm a little distracted.

157
00:05:25,418 --> 00:05:28,553
Debating on whether to share
a little piece of life news.

158
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:30,805
Oh, so you do know how to share,
just not the ball.

159
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:33,007
Pass it, man! Aah!

160
00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:35,176
Can you bend it?
Could be a ligament.

161
00:05:35,194 --> 00:05:36,811
Could be a scaphoid fracture
along the carpus here.

162
00:05:36,845 --> 00:05:37,979
Let's go to my office
and get an X-ray.

163
00:05:38,013 --> 00:05:39,397
Guys!

164
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:42,067
Ryan and I may be having a baby.

165
00:05:42,118 --> 00:05:43,851
Oh.
No!

166
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:46,488
Homosexuality is the ultimate
form of birth control!

167
00:05:46,522 --> 00:05:47,906
How could you do
this to us, David?

168
00:05:47,957 --> 00:05:49,741
What? Do what?
What are you talking about?

169
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:51,159
Don't you know?!

170
00:05:51,193 --> 00:05:52,710
We live through you!

171
00:05:52,745 --> 00:05:53,694
When you watch hockey

172
00:05:53,712 --> 00:05:55,163
without multitasking

173
00:05:55,197 --> 00:05:56,714
a game of candyland...

174
00:05:56,749 --> 00:05:57,882
every single time,

175
00:05:57,917 --> 00:06:01,035
all of us...
we pretend to be you,

176
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:03,204
just without the guy-on-guy sex.

177
00:06:03,222 --> 00:06:04,372
That's funny.

178
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,591
I thought you guys
would be happy for us.

179
00:06:06,642 --> 00:06:08,059
Hearing about your life
without kids...

180
00:06:08,094 --> 00:06:09,227
that's what makes us happy!

181
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:11,062
And now
you've screwed it all up!

182
00:06:11,097 --> 00:06:13,264
You're gay! You could've avoided
this whole parenting mess!

183
00:06:13,315 --> 00:06:15,567
You could have gotten
out alive, man.

184
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:18,820
I have a three-year-old son
and six-month-old twin girls.

185
00:06:18,854 --> 00:06:21,606
Do you know the last time
I made love to my wife?

186
00:06:21,657 --> 00:06:24,359
Seriously. I'm asking you.

187
00:06:24,393 --> 00:06:26,727
Do you know?
Because I don't!

188
00:06:26,745 --> 00:06:29,497
They say you don't know real
love till you have children.

189
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:31,499
Yes, you do. It's called
spare cash, free time

190
00:06:31,534 --> 00:06:32,917
and daylight masturbation.

191
00:06:32,952 --> 00:06:34,786
I don't know anything
about the guy

192
00:06:34,837 --> 00:06:37,172
who invented sleep deprivation
as a torture technique.

193
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:40,091
The one thing I do know...
that dude's got kids.

194
00:06:40,126 --> 00:06:41,876
You guys are scaring me.

195
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,378
Couldn't have told me all this

196
00:06:43,412 --> 00:06:45,096
before I went
into that little room

197
00:06:45,131 --> 00:06:47,682
with the cup and
the Kevin bacon DVD?

198
00:06:47,716 --> 00:06:49,551
Breathe deep, man.

199
00:06:49,585 --> 00:06:52,554
These are your
last moments of freedom.

200
00:06:52,588 --> 00:06:54,772
I'm letting the couch thing go.

201
00:06:54,807 --> 00:06:56,141
I mean, it's just stuff.

202
00:06:56,192 --> 00:06:57,976
Right? It's not like
stuff can love you,

203
00:06:58,027 --> 00:06:59,978
or stuff can take care of you
in your old age.

204
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:01,896
Then again,
I don't really intend to age.

205
00:07:01,931 --> 00:07:03,448
It's just so expected, you know?

206
00:07:03,482 --> 00:07:05,783
What's wrong with you?
Looks like you just learned

207
00:07:05,818 --> 00:07:06,784
the green lantern is gay
all over again.

208
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:08,203
The guys are right.

209
00:07:08,237 --> 00:07:10,622
If Goldie's test is positive,
our lives are over.

210
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:13,158
Yes, David, it's just like
the schoolyard song.

211
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:15,710
(Reciting rhythmically): Bryan
and David, sittin' in a tree

212
00:07:15,744 --> 00:07:18,296
k-I-s-s-I-n-g.

213
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,747
First comes love,

214
00:07:19,781 --> 00:07:21,583
then comes
the inability to marry,

215
00:07:21,617 --> 00:07:24,335
then comes a stranger and
an invasive medical procedure,

216
00:07:24,386 --> 00:07:26,804
then comes the baby
in the baby carriage.

217
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:29,457
It's just,
I went from med school

218
00:07:29,475 --> 00:07:32,093
to my practice,
always so responsible.

219
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:36,297
I mean, when was the last time
we went to a bar and cut loose?

220
00:07:36,315 --> 00:07:38,149
I don't know.
The night we met?

221
00:07:38,184 --> 00:07:41,519
Excuse me?
Uh, is this seat taken?

222
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,687
It's for my date.

223
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:45,106
But I don't think he's coming.

224
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,658
I got stood up.

225
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:48,910
You dodged a bullet.

226
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:51,362
Anyone who'd stand you up
must be crazy.

227
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:52,664
Oh, my God, I
thought that, too,

228
00:07:52,698 --> 00:07:54,699
but I thought I
was the only one.

229
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,867
You want to sit?

230
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:58,203
Oh.

231
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:01,122
I was supposed
to meet Lance bass.

232
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:02,490
Oh, I don't know him.

233
00:08:02,508 --> 00:08:05,176
Closeted singer?
From n*sync? Got nothing?

234
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:08,496
Are you sure you're in the
right <i>type</i> of bar, sir?

235
00:08:08,514 --> 00:08:11,716
Oh, uh, you see those guys
over there in the corner?

236
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:14,219
Yeah. Those are my boys.

237
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,637
Well, aren't you
the piggy eater.

238
00:08:15,671 --> 00:08:17,188
Oh, no, they're not like me.

239
00:08:17,223 --> 00:08:19,724
Us. Uh, we just graduated
med school today.

240
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:21,025
That's a lot of reading.

241
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,193
Well, I was out all day

242
00:08:22,228 --> 00:08:23,228
celebrating
with their girlfriends,

243
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:25,146
so they wanted
to support me with my thing.

244
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,698
Oh.

245
00:08:26,732 --> 00:08:29,400
Actually, I've never been
to one of these places before.

246
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:31,018
Real smoky.

247
00:08:31,036 --> 00:08:33,854
Good God, no wonder you
keep those things sheathed.

248
00:08:33,872 --> 00:08:35,990
They're the color of
Picasso's most overrated period,

249
00:08:36,024 --> 00:08:39,160
or... or a box from Tiffany.

250
00:08:43,632 --> 00:08:46,134
Can I...?
(Clears throat)

251
00:08:46,168 --> 00:08:48,869
May I buy you another drink?

252
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:51,256
I'll leave right after,
I promise.

253
00:08:51,307 --> 00:08:54,709
It's just, my-my friends
are really rooting for me,

254
00:08:54,727 --> 00:08:56,261
and I don't want
to let them down.

255
00:08:56,312 --> 00:08:57,712
Come on. Let's dance.

256
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,231
Huh? I don't really do that.

257
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:02,717
You've never danced with
a boy before, have you?

258
00:09:02,735 --> 00:09:04,986
One that, you know, leads?

259
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,571
It's bananarama, sweetie.

260
00:09:06,605 --> 00:09:08,406
We all do.

261
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,991
Okay, so it's a plan.

262
00:09:10,025 --> 00:09:12,243
This week we are going out
just like we used to.

263
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:13,611
Or like we never did.

264
00:09:13,662 --> 00:09:15,947
Yes. Before we fully morph into
an old lesbian couple. Mm.

265
00:09:15,998 --> 00:09:18,316
Minus the frowns
and the gingerbread men bodies.

266
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:27,378
My first instinct was to never address
the couch issue.

267
00:09:27,498 --> 00:09:29,600
Just to use my energy to
wish you nothing but the worst.

268
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,064
No friends at recess,

269
00:09:31,098 --> 00:09:32,515
female pattern baldness

270
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:34,434
and a shampoo
without a single botanical.

271
00:09:34,485 --> 00:09:36,102
But David said, "no, be direct."

272
00:09:36,153 --> 00:09:37,837
So I decided to fire you.

273
00:09:37,872 --> 00:09:39,639
Except you don't work for me
in any official capacity.

274
00:09:39,673 --> 00:09:41,141
(With accent):
Do you know of any libra men?

275
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:42,375
I find them so reasonable.

276
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:44,577
In an attempt to practice
my parental skills,

277
00:09:44,612 --> 00:09:46,196
I've decided to
use words instead.

278
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,166
You colored on my expensive
couch, and I am very upset.

279
00:09:50,201 --> 00:09:52,335
What do you have to say for yourself?
I would never.

280
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:55,255
I have too much regard
for antiquities of all kinds.

281
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:57,123
Are you doing little Edie
from <i>grey gardens?</i>

282
00:09:57,174 --> 00:09:58,792
Oh, what a clever judge
of character!

283
00:09:58,843 --> 00:10:00,510
Obsessed with that documentary!

284
00:10:00,544 --> 00:10:02,212
I wanted to be little Edie
for Halloween,

285
00:10:02,246 --> 00:10:03,429
but my mother said I couldn't.

286
00:10:03,464 --> 00:10:05,632
She said I could go
as one of the feral cats.

287
00:10:05,683 --> 00:10:08,101
But joke's on my mom, though,
'cause boots was a lady cat.

288
00:10:08,135 --> 00:10:09,519
Wait. Are you trying
to distract me?

289
00:10:09,553 --> 00:10:11,354
'Cause you're still
in a lot of trouble, miss.

290
00:10:11,388 --> 00:10:12,806
If you can't get
a man to propose,

291
00:10:12,857 --> 00:10:14,390
then you might as well be dead.

292
00:10:14,424 --> 00:10:15,558
Oh, I got another one.
Do it again.

293
00:10:15,593 --> 00:10:16,726
If you can't get
a man to propose,

294
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,361
then you might as well be dead.

295
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:20,313
You just stay on the 405, and you
get off at sepulveda. Oh, okay.

296
00:10:20,364 --> 00:10:22,315
Oh, looks like you two
worked it out. Well.

297
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:24,100
Come on, baby. Nana said
I could only use the car

298
00:10:24,118 --> 00:10:25,285
until bill O'Reilly's done.

299
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:28,138
Time to go home.
No, I want to stay here.

300
00:10:28,172 --> 00:10:29,239
I like it here too, Shania.

301
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:30,290
They don't use old mail

302
00:10:30,324 --> 00:10:31,774
as coasters,
but it's not our home.

303
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:32,959
Let's go.

304
00:10:32,993 --> 00:10:34,794
You can come back
and swim tomorrow.

305
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:37,197
Ryan and I are going dancing.

306
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:38,548
Which is why David
is dressed like

307
00:10:38,582 --> 00:10:40,049
one of Madonna's boyfriends.

308
00:10:40,084 --> 00:10:41,501
What? What's the matter
with this?

309
00:10:41,552 --> 00:10:42,635
This is my young outfit.

310
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,220
Hmm. See ya.

311
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:46,556
Oh, mother darling, must we
go back to grey gardens?

312
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,141
I can't bear the stench

313
00:10:48,175 --> 00:10:49,642
of dying dreams.

314
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:52,011
Why is she dressed like
a hasidic grandma?

315
00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:54,063
(Dance music playing)

316
00:10:57,101 --> 00:10:59,652
(Sighs)

317
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:04,524
How funny is Shania's
little Edie impression?

318
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,075
Yeah, who is little Edie?

319
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,328
I hate it when you pretend
not to know gay stuff

320
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:09,662
so you seem less gay.

321
00:11:09,697 --> 00:11:11,080
But I don't know who that is.

322
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:12,832
See? That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

323
00:11:14,752 --> 00:11:16,085
Thank you.
Thank you.

324
00:11:19,823 --> 00:11:21,090
Feels late.

325
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,543
Ooh, 9:45.

326
00:11:23,594 --> 00:11:24,961
Did we tape
<i>say yes to the dress?</i>

327
00:11:24,995 --> 00:11:26,996
Season pass.
Love you.

328
00:11:30,134 --> 00:11:31,184
Bry...

329
00:11:31,218 --> 00:11:34,520
We're here to recapture our youth,

330
00:11:34,555 --> 00:11:36,890
but no matter how fast
we chase after it...

331
00:11:36,941 --> 00:11:38,441
We're never gonna catch it.

332
00:11:38,475 --> 00:11:41,394
So why don't we stop chasing
and admit defeat.

333
00:11:41,445 --> 00:11:43,947
Okay.

334
00:11:43,981 --> 00:11:45,565
We're getting older.

335
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:46,566
You are.

336
00:11:46,617 --> 00:11:47,817
And I've agreed to be

337
00:11:47,851 --> 00:11:50,403
your youthful companion
until you wither and die.

338
00:11:52,323 --> 00:11:54,123
You know what?

339
00:11:54,158 --> 00:11:55,992
I don't care if
my life changes.

340
00:11:56,026 --> 00:11:57,160
I want it to.

341
00:11:57,194 --> 00:11:59,412
I want this baby.
I want this family.

342
00:11:59,463 --> 00:12:00,413
I want it all.

343
00:12:00,464 --> 00:12:01,748
And you know what?

344
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,999
I want it with you.

345
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:09,339
Man:
Mmm. Hey... you guys?

346
00:12:09,373 --> 00:12:12,425
Young man, we are old
enough to be your fathers.

347
00:12:14,178 --> 00:12:16,512
Are we cougars?

348
00:12:16,546 --> 00:12:18,848
There's something else
I want, too.

349
00:12:18,882 --> 00:12:20,433
The good news is...

350
00:12:20,484 --> 00:12:22,151
Once we're tired
of using these as curtains,

351
00:12:22,186 --> 00:12:23,853
we can take naps in them.

352
00:12:26,357 --> 00:12:29,359
I know we've been going through
a lot of changes lately.

353
00:12:29,393 --> 00:12:30,994
You, uh...

354
00:12:31,028 --> 00:12:32,695
You want to talk
about what's going on?

355
00:12:32,729 --> 00:12:34,664
Oh, no, mother darling.

356
00:12:34,698 --> 00:12:37,917
All that oxygen to the teeth
promotes decay.

357
00:12:37,952 --> 00:12:39,285
Shania...

358
00:12:39,336 --> 00:12:41,404
Do you keep pretending
to be this "evie" person

359
00:12:41,422 --> 00:12:43,373
because you think
it's not okay to be you?

360
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:46,175
I don't know.

361
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,126
(Knocking on door)

362
00:12:47,177 --> 00:12:48,177
(Splutters)

363
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:53,933
Oh, hey.
Oh, hi.

364
00:12:53,968 --> 00:12:55,635
Did you guys
get blood test results?

365
00:12:55,686 --> 00:12:56,936
Is that why you're here?

366
00:12:56,971 --> 00:12:58,304
David:
No, no, no. Not yet.

367
00:12:58,355 --> 00:13:00,589
Sorry to just drop in.

368
00:13:00,607 --> 00:13:01,808
We'd say we were
in the neighborhood,

369
00:13:01,859 --> 00:13:03,426
but you'd know we were lying.

370
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:05,594
Hey, Shania,
who's your little friend?

371
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:07,563
This is my pet raccoon Buster.

372
00:13:07,597 --> 00:13:09,532
He thrives on pâté.

373
00:13:09,566 --> 00:13:10,700
Bryan:
Well, this place is like...

374
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:14,237
Shabby chic,
without all that pesky chic.

375
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:16,706
Mother's trying hard
to find a style.

376
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,107
It's truly astonishing
and abominable.

377
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,043
That's little Edie.
That's little Edie.

378
00:13:20,077 --> 00:13:21,744
I thought you guys
were going out dancing.

379
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:23,946
Oh, no, we actually
cut out early

380
00:13:23,964 --> 00:13:25,748
because we would like
to give you

381
00:13:25,782 --> 00:13:27,583
a little bit of
a housewarming gift.

382
00:13:27,617 --> 00:13:29,052
You guys didn't have to.

383
00:13:29,086 --> 00:13:31,504
You've already been
so good to us.

384
00:13:31,555 --> 00:13:33,556
Your housewarming gift is...

385
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,959
A new house!

386
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:40,563
They're in shock.

387
00:13:40,597 --> 00:13:41,848
I think they're in shock.

388
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:42,965
It's our guest house.

389
00:13:42,983 --> 00:13:45,018
It's got two bedrooms.

390
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:46,235
Full laundry.

391
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,904
With a cotton candy maker.

392
00:13:47,938 --> 00:13:49,188
Well, yeah, what are we animals?

393
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:50,806
Well, Nana says yes,
but I don't think so.

394
00:13:50,824 --> 00:13:51,807
Okay.

395
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:53,443
David:
Someone is always home

396
00:13:53,477 --> 00:13:55,978
so there's built-in
day care for Shania.

397
00:13:55,996 --> 00:13:56,979
Plus...

398
00:13:56,997 --> 00:13:59,615
It is rent-free.

399
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:01,918
So all of your money
will go to your dream

400
00:14:01,952 --> 00:14:03,252
of law school.

401
00:14:03,287 --> 00:14:04,871
It's the perfect solution.

402
00:14:04,922 --> 00:14:07,040
Rust-free fixtures.

403
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:09,125
With divine gay
bric-a-brac.

404
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:12,762
No, I... don't get it.

405
00:14:12,796 --> 00:14:14,430
What do you guys get out of it?

406
00:14:14,465 --> 00:14:16,999
We don't want you to feel like
you're out here all on your own.

407
00:14:17,017 --> 00:14:19,519
Can we stay, mom?
Please, can we?

408
00:14:27,979 --> 00:14:30,181
my two lead characters
so I can start a Twitter riot.

409
00:14:30,215 --> 00:14:32,283
You think your mom
will let you stay?

410
00:14:32,815 --> 00:14:33,848
(Normal voice):
Hope so.

411
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:37,068
Done. Millions
of teen tears.

412
00:14:37,102 --> 00:14:39,303
But what would little Edie
say? Wouldn't she say...

413
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:41,806
(With hepburn voice):
I hope the head on her shoulders

414
00:14:41,824 --> 00:14:44,308
is attached to the rest
of her body.

415
00:14:44,326 --> 00:14:45,309
She's not Kate Hepburn.

416
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:46,361
What's wrong with you?

417
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:47,862
Did something happen?

418
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:50,281
I started my new school
this week.

419
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:53,201
What's with the scarf?

420
00:14:53,252 --> 00:14:56,320
Going through chemo?
Or just Muslim?

421
00:14:56,338 --> 00:14:58,373
There's nothing worse than
dealing with a dogmatic female,

422
00:14:58,424 --> 00:14:59,824
I'm sure.

423
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,794
Those kids don't get me at all.

424
00:15:02,828 --> 00:15:05,046
I know. When I was a kid,
nobody got me, either.

425
00:15:05,097 --> 00:15:06,180
Guys, guys!

426
00:15:06,215 --> 00:15:07,999
I've painstakingly recreated

427
00:15:08,017 --> 00:15:10,167
the entire carrington
mansion from <i>dynasty</i>

428
00:15:10,185 --> 00:15:12,053
out of creamsicle sticks.
Check out the tiny

429
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:14,806
reflection pool, it's perfect
for vicious cat fights.

430
00:15:18,277 --> 00:15:19,644
This might be
hard to believe, Shania,

431
00:15:19,678 --> 00:15:21,679
but I didn't always fit in
like I do now.

432
00:15:21,697 --> 00:15:23,314
I always felt different.
Just like you.

433
00:15:23,348 --> 00:15:24,816
My Nana thinks I'm nuts,

434
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,784
and my mom thinks
I'm acting crazy

435
00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:28,653
'cause of all
the changes going on,

436
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:31,122
but this has always
just been me.

437
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:33,825
Bryan, I'm a weirdo
and I don't want to be.

438
00:15:33,859 --> 00:15:35,860
I just want to be normal.

439
00:15:35,878 --> 00:15:38,796
What a stupid,
shortsighted wish.

440
00:15:40,032 --> 00:15:42,300
You don't know this yet,
but the most unique

441
00:15:42,334 --> 00:15:45,303
parts of you are also the ones
that will lead you to greatness.

442
00:15:45,337 --> 00:15:48,256
And to a chalet in deer
valley with direct slope access.

443
00:15:48,307 --> 00:15:51,175
How come you get me
but my own mom doesn't?

444
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:53,177
Your mom may not
totally get you,

445
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:55,179
but she lets you be who you are

446
00:15:55,213 --> 00:15:56,314
and she loves you for it.

447
00:15:56,348 --> 00:15:58,349
Don't be afraid
to be who you are, Shania.

448
00:15:58,383 --> 00:16:00,652
'Cause you're spectacular.

449
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:04,055
Except when you lie.

450
00:16:04,073 --> 00:16:06,157
Now, I need you to finally cop

451
00:16:06,191 --> 00:16:09,744
to your act of
vandalism and apologize.

452
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:11,696
(With accent): I didn't want
to be a tattletale,

453
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,165
but us special people
got to stick together.

454
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:16,067
Oh, she's back.
I wasn't the one

455
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:18,369
who colored on your couch,
but I know who did.

456
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:24,926
Damn, she's good.

457
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,377
She wanted to turn me
against kids,

458
00:16:26,411 --> 00:16:27,411
so I'd get skittish
about this baby

459
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:28,713
and forget about
the whole thing.

460
00:16:28,747 --> 00:16:31,683
Well, like it or not,
your Nana is special, too.

461
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:33,685
I mean, what the hell
else is she capable of?

462
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:35,436
(With accent):
I mean, really.

463
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:38,640
That was close.
No.

464
00:16:46,315 --> 00:16:48,149
Clay, what are you doing here?

465
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,617
We need to talk.

466
00:16:49,652 --> 00:16:52,370
Goldie, you... you look hot.

467
00:16:52,404 --> 00:16:53,771
Oh...

468
00:16:53,789 --> 00:16:56,741
But not hot-sweaty.
Come on, you got it, right?

469
00:16:56,775 --> 00:16:58,275
Yeah.
No, don't.

470
00:16:58,293 --> 00:17:00,044
Don't come any closer.
Babe, please...

471
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,163
Come on, I miss you.

472
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:03,748
I want us to be a family again.

473
00:17:03,782 --> 00:17:05,917
It's all I want.
It's all I think about.

474
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:08,803
Say, "I want us
to be a family again."

475
00:17:08,837 --> 00:17:10,304
Say, "it's all I want."

476
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,789
Say, "it's all I think about."

477
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:13,007
The "I" is me, right?

478
00:17:13,058 --> 00:17:15,893
Say, "that being without you
has made me change."

479
00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:18,646
Say, "it's made me want to grow
up." Say...

480
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:21,298
Look, I know I messed up
real bad, but...

481
00:17:21,316 --> 00:17:22,900
I'll do anything.

482
00:17:22,935 --> 00:17:25,319
Everything to make it right.

483
00:17:25,354 --> 00:17:27,638
When you left, you took
a piece of my heart with you.

484
00:17:27,656 --> 00:17:28,940
See, when you left, you...

485
00:17:28,974 --> 00:17:31,642
You took a piece
of my heart with you, and...

486
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,779
I just, I can't
live without it.

487
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,752
But, um...

488
00:17:40,786 --> 00:17:43,838
All the lying
and the other girls...

489
00:17:43,872 --> 00:17:46,007
How am I ever supposed
to trust you again?

490
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,175
Jane:
<i>She's going to ask you</i>

491
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:48,292
about trust.

492
00:17:48,326 --> 00:17:49,711
Here's what you're gonna say.

493
00:17:49,762 --> 00:17:52,880
Say: "I'll do anything
to make you trust me.

494
00:17:52,931 --> 00:17:54,265
"I'm not myself.

495
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:55,883
I'm a shell of a man..."

496
00:17:55,934 --> 00:17:59,020
♪

497
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,776
You are the stupidest person
alive.

498
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,645
I don't know.
I can't remember that one.

499
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,781
(Gasps)

500
00:18:09,815 --> 00:18:12,016
I want a divorce.

501
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:14,869
You want...
You want to dump me?

502
00:18:14,903 --> 00:18:17,071
That's cool.

503
00:18:19,324 --> 00:18:21,909
You know, I'm not ditching
Shania here.

504
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,911
A girl needs a real man
in her life.

505
00:18:23,962 --> 00:18:26,164
Yeah, well, now she has two.

506
00:18:26,198 --> 00:18:29,083
Yeah, yeah.

507
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:36,512
Bryan:
Shania, we have to get you white heels.

508
00:18:36,525 --> 00:18:38,193
I cannot believe this.

509
00:18:38,227 --> 00:18:39,911
I can't believe
I haven't seen us before.

510
00:18:39,945 --> 00:18:41,579
Bryan:
This is the best part.

511
00:18:41,614 --> 00:18:42,914
Hey, you guys.

512
00:18:42,948 --> 00:18:43,448
David: Oh, hey, come,
come, come, come.

513
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:44,916
Uh, Shania,

514
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,284
I talked to your dad.
He's gonna spend

515
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:47,368
some time with you tomorrow.

516
00:18:47,402 --> 00:18:49,087
My dad's coming to L.A.?

517
00:18:49,121 --> 00:18:50,955
Yeah. Uh, but not here.

518
00:18:52,124 --> 00:18:53,424
To our place.

519
00:18:53,459 --> 00:18:56,211
So let's grab our stuff.
Let's go home.

520
00:18:56,245 --> 00:18:57,245
This is home.

521
00:18:57,263 --> 00:18:59,047
This is Bryan and David's home.

522
00:18:59,081 --> 00:19:00,849
This is the life they earned.

523
00:19:00,883 --> 00:19:02,083
Not us.

524
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:04,418
Yeah, but it would
really mean a lot to us

525
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:05,920
for you both to stay.

526
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:07,806
Um, I...

527
00:19:07,857 --> 00:19:09,140
We can't.

528
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:11,359
I'm scared of getting
too comfortable.

529
00:19:11,393 --> 00:19:12,861
But isn't that a good thing?

530
00:19:12,895 --> 00:19:14,946
It's the worst.

531
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,365
The boy I married
was four inches shorter

532
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:18,867
than the husband I left.

533
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:21,236
I mean, we both
weren't done growing yet.

534
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,537
We lived with my Nana,

535
00:19:22,571 --> 00:19:26,241
and we raised this
incredible daughter.

536
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:28,126
And that life felt safe,
even though it wasn't.

537
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,210
Maybe if I'd felt

538
00:19:29,245 --> 00:19:30,378
less comfortable,

539
00:19:30,412 --> 00:19:32,280
I wouldn't have wasted
so much time.

540
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:33,498
What about me?

541
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:34,999
What about what I need?

542
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,835
Come here, baby.

543
00:19:36,886 --> 00:19:39,504
You...

544
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:42,891
You are an old soul, Shania,

545
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:45,393
but you're still just
my baby girl.

546
00:19:45,427 --> 00:19:47,896
It's important you see me
as an independent woman,

547
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,598
so that, someday,
you can become one.

548
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,968
You're so lucky, Shania.

549
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,854
Your mom's one of
the special ones.

550
00:19:55,905 --> 00:19:58,406
Like you and me.

551
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,158
And me.

552
00:20:00,192 --> 00:20:02,827
Yes, like you.
Of course, like you.

553
00:20:02,862 --> 00:20:04,145
Yeah.

554
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:08,533
(Phone rings)

555
00:20:12,321 --> 00:20:13,588
Hello.

556
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:17,125
David:
Uh-huh.

557
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:19,961
Are you sure?

558
00:20:19,995 --> 00:20:22,330
You're sure.

559
00:20:22,348 --> 00:20:23,932
Okay.

560
00:20:23,966 --> 00:20:25,333
Thank you.

561
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,024
We are officially pregnant.

562
00:20:35,311 --> 00:20:36,444
You know what that means...

563
00:20:37,422 --> 00:20:39,113
Group hug!

564
00:20:39,148 --> 00:20:41,232
Come on.

565
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,234
Come here.

566
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:44,852
Oh!

567
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,959
