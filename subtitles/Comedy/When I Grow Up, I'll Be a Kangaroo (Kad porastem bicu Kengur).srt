1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,797
“When I grow up,
I'll be Kangaroo”

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,435
Afternoon. -God bless you.
Yes?

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,674
-Three dinar-and-a-half
candles.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,070
-Somi, what's your fucking problem?
Now you're saving?

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,678
-Don't swear in church.
-Forgive me God, I don't know

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,828
what I'm doing. -Sorry, please.
Give us three five-dinar ones.

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,799
-Madam, give us four of the
fifteen-dinar ones, and one for

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,793
Kangaroo's dead dad. I know you've
got sixty, give it here.

9
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:54,429
-Here you go. -Thanks

10
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,476
-Mate, god doesn't make
a distinction between candles.

11
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,236
-Clearly he does, or why would
there be ones for a dinar,

12
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,432
five, ten dinars... -OK.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,596
-God, look down on us poor
and pathetic today.

14
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,874
I know you're busy, but you only
need look on us today.

15
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,518
And be merciful to our mate
Kangaroo in the Eastwich goal.

16
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,835
Mate, God... Don't Somi...
-Sorry.

17
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,589
-If we get rich today, we won't
forget the church, the poor,

18
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,277
the invalids. If we have to we'll
go to London and tell

19
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,719
Kangaroo to give half his wages
to those who need it most...

20
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,912
-Come on, man. -That's it.

21
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,235
-Two hundred, and the change.
God you're miserable, mate.

22
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,871
You're meeting an amazing bird
with 200 dinars in your pocket.

23
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,318
You're the saddest of the sad
in the saddest country.

24
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,714
-Hello?

25
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,109
-Rada, you gave birth to Kangaroo!

26
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,396
-Oh, it's you mum.

27
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,757
He hasn't called, how can he
when there's a game?

28
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,390
-I bought Kangaroo his
first gloves! Me!

29
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,793
-Neighbour Rade! Lying,
drinking, stealing Rade!

30
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,116
-Braca, when they invent a tool
to measure misery it'll have

31
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,513
your name on it. - Hi Polanski!
-Sladjana!

32
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,269
-Sladjana is the commonest of all
common names. But Iris.

33
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,996
-So how's it going at home?
-Everyone's fine, thank god.

34
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,398
-Look, you're better off finding
a job than wasting time

35
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,957
in the bookies.
-True, true.

36
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,709
-One suggestion. I'll pray for your
Kangaroo if you two look

37
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,591
for work. How's that? -OK.
-Roma as well. -Sorry?

38
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,913
-Roma have to win as well.
-You little rascals. Go away.

39
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,914
-Iris, man how that sounds!
Best of all, Braca's going to

40
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,869
make love to that same Iris.
Make love to her hard, gentle.

41
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,915
-Yeah, that's not the same poor
bastard. This is the new Braca.

42
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,834
Handsome Braca, successful Brace,
super-successful,

43
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,357
super sex-symbol,
Braca - King of the women.

44
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,477
-Afternoon, two of the
seven dinar ones.

45
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:58,353
-Kid, get rid of the cigarette.
-Sorry. Here are you exactly.

46
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,797
-Fuck, Avaks, I always get it
further than you.

47
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,069
-Mate, the point isn't in the
length but in the piss.

48
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,676
-Fucking air-conditioning.

49
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,395
-Good afternoon Mrs Rada.
-Hi Misa. -Get lost kids!

50
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,917
-How are you?
-Not bad, love.

51
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,550
-Are we watching the match together?
-Well we agreed to.

52
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,195
-Good, good. -Has Kangaroo called,
just tell me he did?

53
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,318
-He called. He wants stuffed cabbage!
He's never eaten

54
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,796
stuffed cabbage!
How can I send it to him?

55
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,796
-Did he say he'd wear the cap today?
-He promised he would.

56
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,157
-I told you! I told you!

57
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,792
Please, tell me honestly,
did he ask about us two?

58
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,638
-He only asks about you!
Are you still smoking that dope?

59
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,317
-Oh come on Mrs Rada!
Get lost kids!

60
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,638
-Oh Misa, those English
don't even eat bread.

61
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,513
What do those people eat?
-Come on! Fish and chips, Mrs Rada.

62
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,552
-Mate, pissing is the most
satisfying thing in life.

63
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,555
I'd love to drink 100 crates
of beer and piss all week.

64
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,469
-Where's that idiot? I can't believe
he's going let me down.

65
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,072
-Braca! -Hey, chief! How you doing,
did you bring it?

66
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,632
What's that? -A shirt, mate.

67
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,708
-And the cash? Mate,
did you bring me the cash?

68
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,834
-This is for you, mate. Tonight
you're going out with a model,

69
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,275
and not with some local tart.

70
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,750
-Great, I need the cash,
what's wrong with you?

71
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,955
-Try it, it's Italian. Don't be a bum.
-Hey, what's up guys?

72
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,477
-Hi chief! Look at him, came here
as a refugee, started with

73
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,518
shish kebabs and
ended up with a Mercedes.

74
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,509
Look at this. Look at him.
Why's he better than me?

75
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,759
-Hi, Braca. -Hi, put this on the tab,
and give me five shish

76
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,715
in a bun. Today.

77
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:54,034
-Sumpor, mate, you didn't bring
me the cash? -No.

78
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,030
-Give me five minutes.

79
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,596
-Here you go. -What the hell's this?
What do I do with this?

80
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,871
-Well, first you go to the cinema,
then an empty flat.

81
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,709
It's enough. -It's not enough,
Sumpor. Do you know what this

82
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,634
bird's like? -I know mate.
-You know shit, mate.

83
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,950
She shines, man! -So take her into
the dark to shine for you.

84
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,955
-Fuck you. -Sorry,
hold on a second.

85
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,796
Banjaluka, look what I've got
for you. -What's that?

86
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,150
-A pressure cuff.
-What pressure?

87
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,359
-Blood, mate! Age, fat, stress.
Get it? What good's money

88
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,554
without your health? -I lost my
bloody country, I don't give a

89
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,480
fuck about pressure. Have you got
some pussy to ease my lower

90
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,550
pressure? -Don't be vulgar,
I'm a serious salesman.

91
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,792
-Fuck it, you've got the shirt,
you've got charm, she's yours.

92
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,870
-Alright lads!
-Hi Cile!

93
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,478
-Thanks. Look at this.
-Give me a burger and a coke.

94
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,230
-What's that? -A pressure cuff.
-What do I want with that?

95
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,990
-You wouldn't believe the porno
I saw with one of these!

96
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:44,715
Hey, ask her if she's been
with Brad Pitt. I read it somewhere.

97
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,435
-How you doing Ljubica,
my little peasant!

98
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,079
Give everyone a drink.
Mile, give me the remote.

99
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,715
Has Grimsby started?
-He put down Derby.

100
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,800
-On its own?
-No, with Turin.

101
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,470
-Guys! Do you want me
to tell you what's football?

102
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,599
-I can't watch one match in peace,
my whole life disturbed.

103
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,513
-Football is when Sunderland
are leading two nil against

104
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,879
Leeds till the eighty-seventh minute,
and Leeds get three.

105
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,153
That's football!
-What's bloody football?

106
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,275
-That...when Leeds get...
-Stop talking shit.

107
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,550
-Fuck you fucking Brondby!
A hundred years they can't score,

108
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,312
till now! -Didn't I tell you it
would be a draw at Brondby?

109
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,955
-Who did you tell?
-I told Ljuba, didn't I?

110
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,716
-So, why didn't you bet! -I'm not
stupid enough to bet on

111
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,109
Scandinavians.
-Denmark isn't Scandinavia.

112
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:56,079
-Then what the fuck is it?
-A Benelux country. BE-NE-LUX.

113
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,950
Belgium, the Netherlands,
that's Holland, and Lux is

114
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,031
Luxemburg. -Then where does
Denmark go, fucker?

115
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,355
-Hybrid? -Yes, mate.
-What day is it today?

116
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,353
-Sunday, mate.
-No way it's Sunday!

117
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,753
-Why, something you have to do?
-No, I was just tripping it was

118
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,512
Tuesday, Wednesday,
or something. -Sunday, mate.

119
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,234
-The one and only Iris
isn't even coming. Good job too.

120
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,509
What's she gonna do with a bum
with 350 dinars in his pocket.

121
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,279
Braca, king of the bums.
Bra-ca-b-um!

122
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,431
-Alright Braca, mate?
-Hi Nebojsa.

123
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:11,717
-Sone, mate. Nebojsa's a bit
queer. -Iris will see me with

124
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,390
this idiot. Run, Braca, Run
like the wind!

125
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,112
-I guess you're waiting
for some actress?

126
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,396
You directors go for actresses.
Everyone knows that.

127
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,991
-Mate, I study editing.
-So have you edited her?

128
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,436
I bet she squirts like
a fountain! That's their job.

129
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,872
You know who I'd shag? That little one,
what's her name?

130
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,830
She's in that film, the beginning
is the end, and the

131
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,759
end is the beginning,
and everything's mixed in.

132
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,790
-Sone, mate, sorry. -I get it mate,
“artistic obligations”.

133
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,559
-Where you going idiot!
Get out the way!

134
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,839
-Two nights ago at an exhibition.
You know that

135
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,191
feeling all's ok when someone's
standing next to you.

136
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,199
-Suck my dick, twat! Fuck off!
-First the cinema, then I guess

137
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,394
into town, I don't know. Speak soon.
-Donkey, drive that shit!

138
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,958
-You don't have to rush like that,
I'm not in a hurry.

139
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,436
-But I am, sorry.

140
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:20,834
Model? Yeah,
you're familiar.

141
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,912
You going to that stylist's
place perhaps?

142
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,118
I'm always driving him.
He never leaves a tip.

143
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,589
Tell me, those stylists,
what the hell do they do?

144
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,919
A town full of stylists.
I don't get it! You've got

145
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,795
no style, so you go to a stylist
and pick some up!

146
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,908
-Enough makeup! We're going to be
the most spontaneous,

147
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,719
most natural couple in
the world. Braca and I.

148
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,390
-You know who those
stylists are? Queers with jobs.

149
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,359
-I don't have any change.

150
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,794
Where you going?
-Please, my wife's giving birth!

151
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,476
-Fuck you and your wife.

152
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,438
-Man, she's so beautiful.

153
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,552
-Braca, pissed-off,
self-confident and vulnerable.

154
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,072
All at once. -I look like an idiot.
Now she'll tell

155
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,232
me to fuck off, and she'll
go back home.

156
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:44,119
-Man, he's radiant!
-A town full of crazies. -Hi.

157
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,995
-So that's the cult cinema “Vozdovac”?
-That's where I

158
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,951
first watched a film. -And that's why
the cinema is cult?

159
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,194
-Oh man, a witty model!

160
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,952
-What's going on? -Some football match.
A mate from the

161
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,828
neighbourhood is goalkeeper
for an English club.

162
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,358
-I knew it! He told everyone he's
bringing home a model.

163
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,311
-Nuts, nuts, salted, roasted.
Sport for your teeth...

164
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,836
-She thinks that because of her
I won't get any nuts.

165
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,394
Braca doesn't care for the taste
of the petty bourgeoisie.

166
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,718
Braca will get nuts!
Nuts of the world unite!

167
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,078
-Do you want nuts?
-No, I don't eat them.

168
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,309
-Three please,
and a diet coke.

169
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,794
-Man, she's fantastic!
God, she turns me on.

170
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,398
-Can't go in yet. -But it's
one minute to seven.

171
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,068
-Film starts at half past seven.

172
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,113
-In the paper it says seven.
-So watch it in the paper.

173
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,589
-Never mind, let's go for a drink?
-Yeah, we could if I

174
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,516
wasn't a bum.
How embarrassing!

175
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,352
-Braca, you old charmer,
actress huh? Kiss your hand.

176
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,796
Just a second, Braca, have
you fucked this? -Oh, Sone, please.

177
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,357
-Braca, see you mate.

178
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,432
-You're very popular here.

179
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,791
-Do you want me to show
you the sights of Vozdovac?

180
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,270
-At that time I was flogging
stuff around Florence and

181
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,388
screwing some older woman.
She owned a hairdresser's.

182
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,398
-For money? -No, honey, for marbles.
No freebies, even for

183
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,797
grannies. I had 100,000
lira per orgasm.

184
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,352
Once, I went downstairs to the
hairdresser's, flicking through

185
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,713
“Gazetta del Sportivo”, heard the door,
turned around...

186
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,756
Batistuta! -Gabriel?
-I swear!

187
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,951
The hairdresser asks him: “How d'you
want it? ” And he points

188
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,598
to me and says - “The same as
that guy”. -No shit!

189
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,431
-On my mother's life. God knows how we
got to know each other.

190
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,279
Me a word, him a word.

191
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,356
-People, I just drove some
serious pussy! Unbelievable!

192
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,198
Ljubica, give me an espresso!

193
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:29,996
-He doesn't follow fashion, hairstyles.

194
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,068
-And what does Batistuta drive?
-What do you think?

195
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:41,068
-Don't know. A Ferrari? -Yugo!
-No shit, he drives a Yugo?

196
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,918
-Ljubica, are you giving
birth to that espresso?

197
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,788
-A 65A black convertible,
I brought it personally from

198
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,829
Kragujevac. Modest lad, sends
all his money to his mum.

199
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,634
-Is it true you had his girlfriend?
-Cile, please.

200
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,071
-You did, admit it,
womaniser!

201
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,437
-I don't believe it. Do you know
how much this cost?

202
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,719
-Sorry. -You can see she's
distracted by Kangaroo.

203
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,796
-Does Kangaroo perhaps want to
buy my tracksuit? I don't give

204
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,313
a fuck, get lost, do you want
to read my tea leaves?

205
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,158
-Ljubica, did Kangaroo call today?
-Man, you're boring.

206
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,755
-When was Ljubica with Kangaroo?
-She left him,

207
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,035
for Gangula. Kangaroo didn't have
a contract. The lad wanted

208
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,872
to kill himself. And then the
next year, Gangula went behind

209
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,510
bars, and Kangaroo went
from Vozdovac to Eastwich.

210
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,838
Instead of a weekend in London,
Ljubica visits the prison.

211
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,870
-How love is blind!

212
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,750
-Hey, Ljubica, do they have
air-conditioning in prison?

213
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,676
-Like this. -Why?
-Why? Because of the parents.

214
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,271
So ourfingers don't
stink of fags. Get it?

215
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:14,793
Whole term we smoked like mad.
And this was our hideout.

216
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,711
-What wonderful, awfully
gnarled fingers he has.

217
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:27,072
-Besiktas leading! -Come on the Turks!
-Here you go, Zile.

218
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:34,198
-Wait, don't you dare spill it.
The Italians have started.

219
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,155
-Say hi to Gangula for me.
-Do it yourself!

220
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,151
-But in six months time.
-Cile, he's out forthe weekend!

221
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,352
-Aha, in solitary.

222
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,150
-Ljubica? -Afternoon.
-Hey man! -Hi Somi!

223
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,835
-How you doing, my boys!
My successors. Just to say hi.

224
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,278
Ljubica, juice forthe lady!
-No, No.

225
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,390
-Madam, please, this is
a special day for us.

226
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,752
-Burgija, mate, check out my
lucky charm, I'll give you it,

227
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,199
I reckon it's ok. Thank you,
you're a mate.

228
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,875
-And after smoking, we'd eat a
whole tube of toothpaste.

229
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,598
We were constantly
panicking we'd get caught.

230
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,351
We hid in the craziest places
and puffed till we fainted.

231
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,275
That tower block was
our main hideout.

232
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,796
We stood on the roof, watched
the stars, and smoked.

233
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:51,034
-And who's we?
-Avaks, Hybrid and me.

234
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:05,518
-Bye beer, mate.
-This is the last one.

235
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,548
-Banjaluka will give us
some on the tab.

236
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,759
-You don't mind going?
-Of course I mind.

237
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,632
-People, Kangaroo is going to wear
a cap just like this!

238
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:32,029
-Look, Doc, that Cile's school!
That, my boys - Belgrade!

239
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,639
Never and nowhere give up this
holy slice of Belgrade earth.

240
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,877
-Belgrade, Belgrade,
you live with us and in us!

241
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,479
-A great night out for 300 dinars!
You unbelievable star!

242
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,152
-Is that some kind of watch or...
-Pressure cuff.

243
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,315
-What's it for? -Well, you're
so good I could fall ill.

244
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,079
Look, when I get close to you...
Kiss her now Braca!

245
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,873
You can be the owner of
this exclusive, unique instrument

246
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,114
for an amazing 990 dinars!

247
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,669
-You thirsty? -No!
-I'm dying.

248
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,476
-And in a packed Mansfield Road,
David meets Goliath.

249
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,632
The great Manchester United...
-There he is, there's Kangaroo!

250
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,838
-...against Eastwich,
the second division novices.

251
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:52,638
The Manchesterteam,
Barthez, Neville, O'Shea...

252
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,436
-Kangarooooo... -That's it, boy!
With three fingers!

253
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,832
Fuck those Catholics. -Idiot,
the English aren't Catholics.

254
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,399
-What then? -Protestants,
Anglican provenance.

255
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,869
-All the same to me!

256
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,474
-A glorious atmosphere at
Mansfield Road. From thousands

257
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,833
of throats reverberates...
-Mate, take a seat. Chill out.

258
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,717
-Today our homegrown makes his
debut, the young, fearless

259
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,950
giant between the posts,
the unbeatable master of the

260
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,835
penalty area. It's underway!

261
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,794
-You haven't heard of
Todd Bannister? He's the greatest!

262
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,030
Those are the films that should
be made, cheap, fucked up.

263
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:46,399
A line of short cuts, like a video,
and then a long take.

264
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,512
-Hi, what can I get you?
-Have a heart, Iris, please.

265
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,916
-Just water. -For you? -Oh, why not
forget about my diet and

266
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:03,278
relax a little, huh? A Martini Bianco.
-No, Iris, No!

267
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,511
Er, nothing, later maybe.
In fact, a mineral water.

268
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,634
Actually no, sorry, a beer,
a small one...

269
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,711
You fucked me with the Martini.

270
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,112
-Eastwich are trying to muster an
attack but tiny Hughes wins

271
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:33,910
the ball. -Come on tiny!
Fucking come on.

272
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:44,393
I'd fuck them all, from the manager
to the goalie. Sorry.

273
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,869
-Boys, let me see that slip...

274
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,155
Millionaires from Dortmund, got it.
Spurs from London, got it.

275
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,274
-That's what I told them to play.
-What did you tell us?

276
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,592
-Look at him fucking around,
what did I tell you about

277
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,159
Tottenham? -You didn't tell us
anything, don't talk crap.

278
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:20,116
-Toma, come here! Doc!
-Hammers, got it...

279
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,193
-I've got money, come here.
-The boys got West Ham to win

280
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,630
at Liverpool. The old dame from Turin,
caught on the move!

281
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,080
Well done, boys. The wolf from Rome
leading. Boys, if Eastwich

282
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,953
take Manchester, you've got seven grand.
A family ticket!

283
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,950
-Excuse me, if Eastwich what?
-If Eastwich beat Manchester.

284
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,233
-It's about time Manchester
went down for once away.

285
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,558
-What? -I played Eastwich to win,
what's the problem?

286
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,190
-Eastwich to win, against Manchester?
The London paupers

287
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,598
to beat the Red Devils?
Kids, are you insane?

288
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,474
-Why couldn't they have them.
Manchester don't have a team.

289
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,435
-And you'd know whether
Manchester have a team!

290
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,793
What about the trusty
goalkeeper Barthez?

291
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,993
The ruthless Van Nistelrooy?
Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs?

292
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,794
The lynchpin Roy Keane, and the
great Sir Alex Ferguson!

293
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,192
-Home ground is home ground.
Plus, Kangaroo in goal.

294
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,030
-Kangaroo hasn't conceded
for 1,250 minutes.

295
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,911
-Yeah, but in Vozdovac.
This is England.

296
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,754
-Looks what's England, lads!
A full stadium!

297
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,270
-You know, unemployment's high overthere.
-What, and everyone

298
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,235
here works? Don't talk shit!
That's a great nation!

299
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,478
It's raining, and the stadium's full.
Here, the stands are

300
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,151
empty like there's the plague.
Boys, have you ever been to

301
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,718
London? I'll take you,
if you win some money today.

302
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,275
You don't know football till you
visit an English stadium!

303
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,634
-The English build a stadium,
parking spaces, toilets...

304
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,714
Not like here, 30,000 people
in one pissing spot.

305
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,232
Red Star against Barcelona, at
the Marakana, reeked of shit.

306
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,992
The referee wanted to stop the match.
He thought it was a

307
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,834
gas bomb. But it wasn't.

308
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,713
-I don't know, I don't
like American films.

309
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,398
-So what the hell do you like?
Romanian?

310
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,878
Why did I say that? Why am l
a bum with a complex?

311
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,788
-I don't know about Romanian,
but American films are so

312
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,440
predictable. -Yeah, I know what
you're saying. Todd Bannister

313
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,515
is far from predictable.
Actually, you have to

314
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,358
distinguish between Hollywood
and the New York film schools.

315
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,070
They're totally different things.

316
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,959
-Why am I talking about films
when I don't have a clue?

317
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,076
-I'm just going for some fags.

318
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,630
-I knew it. He's not coming back.
I should just shut up and

319
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,800
show my legs. Stupid model
and her stupid personality.

320
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,477
-Mile, get your money out.
-Hey, alright Braca!

321
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,112
-Hello Aunt Rada.
-Hello, Bratislav.

322
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,879
-Get out the way,
Bratislav.

323
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,912
-Somi, you got some cash?
-No, mate, it's all on Kangaroo.

324
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,238
-Fuck, I haven't got any
money to pay the bill.

325
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,708
-That's it Kangaroo, Tsar!
-How's Kangaroo doing?

326
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,436
-Good mate, thank God.
-Cile, can you lend us some money?

327
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,115
-What's up kiddo,
you got hooked too?

328
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,839
-No, mate, but there's this bird...
-Ah, if it was for

329
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,075
education I'd consider it,
but for birds, I can't.

330
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,075
Look at that intervention.
-Compatible.

331
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:35,549
-Here you go, now go fuck yourself,
you and your pussy

332
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,669
and your education, fuck off!!
Go on, get lost and don't jinx

333
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,995
us anymore. -Thanks Zile,
I won't forget it!

334
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,028
-I know, son. When you get to
make a film, you'll put me in

335
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,198
some porno, forthem to
fuck me in the arse!

336
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:58,353
-Dear football fans, you'll
need this fortoday.

337
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,070
-Piss off, you bastard.

338
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:13,190
-Avaks, look! -What?
-I've got some shit in my beer.

339
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,189
-You're drunk and tripping.
-No, a flea or something.

340
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:25,992
Floating up and down in the bottle.
-Mate, my uncle found a

341
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,869
mouse in his beer. -No shit. Did he
drink it? -He sued the

342
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:35,752
brewery for mental suffering.
Said they wrecked his health!

343
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,753
-And did he win? -Screwed them, mate,
for a million dollars!

344
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,715
-A million dollars! Bullshit.
-I swear. He's in Hawaii,

345
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:53,236
fanning his balls.
-What a guy!

346
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:14,908
-Let's go. Hey, countryman,
the change?

347
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,108
-What does the jury say?
Five-five, five-six, five-four...

348
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,518
Why do I think he's different
from the other morons?

349
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,554
-Hold on mate, how did he
get it in dollars?

350
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,952
-Because he was in America.
-Fuck it, here he'd get shit!

351
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,709
-Not true, with a good lawyer
you can do okay here.

352
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,919
-And where do I get the money
for a good lawyer?

353
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,998
-You don't have to give
him money. You give him a cut!

354
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,112
Sue them for a million dinars,
and give him five percent.

355
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,598
-Five percent! Fuck that.
Three percent, and see you later!

356
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,471
-Where to? -What d'you mean
where to, the cinema.

357
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:10,191
-Film's cancelled. -How come?
-Only sold two tickets.

358
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,516
-How many tickets have to be
sold for the film to go ahead?

359
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,954
-Seven.
-Give me five.

360
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,192
-Can we go in the balcony? -No.
-Why? -The balcony isn't open.

361
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,999
-Thanks, you're so kind.

362
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,595
It's not exactly crowded.
-What do the masses know about films?

363
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,952
-Hey, those aren't your seats.
-The cinema's empty, man.

364
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,355
-The seats are numbered. Man.
-And who are we bothering here?

365
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,392
-And what if we get a
group visit? Or the army?

366
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,274
-Surely not the front row?

367
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:31,474
-Where are you going?
-What's this? -No, hold it!

368
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,832
-Oh, what an ugly strip, kids.
-Where's his cap?

369
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,830
-Where's your cap? You betrayed
your neighbourhood.

370
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,430
You think you're some kind
of big shot if you're in London!

371
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,158
-Perhaps he forgot. -But he didn't
forget the 70,000 quid!

372
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:03,031
You little fuck! Sorry.
-Hey, mind the language.

373
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,556
-Hold on, how much
is he getting?

374
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,235
-Two and a half grand a week,
isn't it. -That's right.

375
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,910
-Of what? -Pounds, old man.
-What's that in fucking

376
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,710
Deutschmarks? -Seven grand,
mate, seven grand.

377
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,515
-He's on seven thousand marks a week?
-But it's hard earned.

378
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,589
No social, no hot meals.
Isn't that right Mrs Rada?

379
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:33,069
-People, for that money I'd let
the whole stadium fuck me!

380
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,435
-Burgija, fifty thousand people,
that's quite a few...

381
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,557
-I've got time!

382
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:54,477
-It's not bad here? Different,
more interesting angle.

383
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,995
Andy Warhol always watched
films from the front row.

384
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,719
-I bet he plans to take me to
an apartment after the film.

385
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,158
He can, but in another life.

386
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,191
-Zivac, is that your
navy-blue Citroen? -It is.

387
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,551
-With taxi plates?
-Yeah, what do you want?

388
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,918
-Nothing, it's being towed!
-You little...!

389
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,912
-Full left! -Wait, hold on!
I came just to get the paper,

390
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,632
what's wrong with you.
Hey, genius, this is my livelihood,

391
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:48,236
-And what do I live off?
-Ok, tell me how much? -Wait!

392
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:54,594
-Listen, I know myself but
I don't know you. -Goal!

393
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,837
-Hey, the money? -Fuck yourself!
-What did he say?

394
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:16,358
-He told you to fuck yourself!
-I can't hear anything. Hello?

395
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,990
-Goal, goal. -He put the hat on,
he put it on!

396
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:30,110
-That's it Kangaroo, that's it Serb!
Fuck them. Sorry.

397
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:40,032
-It was a mile offside.
-One nil to little Eastwich!

398
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,397
-Do you know what's good
about this cinema? -No.

399
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,834
-Here a guy doesn't have to rent
the whole cinema to be

400
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,196
with someone he li... I mean...

401
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:15,837
-Someone he what? -Someone he li'...
-Someone he li'?

402
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:25,110
-Li'. -zkes. -Yes, zkes.
Very much zkes.

403
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,353
-I zkes you too, and li' that
you're funny, and that we're

404
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,830
alone in the cinema,
I li' everything.

405
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,873
-Here's to the nuts!
Nuts of the world, unite!

406
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,351
Make love, not war!

407
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,437
-And do you knowwhat's good
about the front row?

408
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:05,273
You can't miss the flying saucers.
-Hey, I have to ask

409
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:12,358
you something, ok? Is it true Brad Pitt
came onto you?

410
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:18,075
-Well, we spoke at a reception,
we were photographed, the

411
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,152
newspaper published it,
and there you go.

412
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:30,831
-Man, she turned down Brad.
Braca the man, alpha male!

413
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,873
-Oh I knew it!
-Oh, I'm such a peasant.

414
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,115
-But, I haven't felt such a shiver
down my spine for ages.

415
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,110
-Peasant, alpha peasant!
Come on, start the film.

416
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,233
-The seats are numbered.
-Oh fuck, he's not actually

417
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:54,118
going to sit with us, please no.
-kiss your hand.

418
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,558
-Why, for god's sake?
Why are you doing this to me?

419
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,434
-I love this film. I've seen it
seven times. You're lovely.

420
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,320
When does it start?
Can't wait!

421
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,113
-And on the green baize of
Mansfield Road, Manchester

422
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:20,636
tighten the noose. The Red Devils
are attacking, Eastwich

423
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:25,518
can only defend as they know.
-Oh for fuck's sake Kangeroo.

424
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:33,836
Fuck you, you freak.
-The thrills are lining up!

425
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:44,877
-There's the village idiot for you.
Makes two good saves, and

426
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,237
lets one in through his legs.

427
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,516
-And there's the punishment.
-Shut up! -Ljubica!

428
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,836
-Don't Zile. -Get off.
-Ljubica!

429
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,797
-I don't give a fuck if his dad
worked on the national team

430
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,315
-Hi! -The linesman's waving his flag.
-It's not a goal?

431
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,709
-...and it stays one-nil to Eastwich...

432
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,912
-No-goal, no-goal...Somi, mate,
offside. -Offside?

433
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,036
-It's not a goal, Zile.
-Beckham protests, but in vain.

434
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,590
Yellow card! The pedantic teacher
from Luton, a renowned

435
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,275
dispenser of justice, and above all
a great sportsman.

436
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,476
-Let's not fuck around. -Send them
all off, the Manchester

437
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,749
bastards. -You can't do that
in the cradle of football.

438
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,952
-Give everyone red cards,
three-nil to Eastwich! Fuck!

439
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,518
-Perhaps it's a mouse embryo.

440
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,799
-You reckon? An aborted baby mouse?
-Anything's possible.

441
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,071
How much do you reckon
I'd get for suing them?

442
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:27,673
-Who can you sue, you're
a moral dwarf. -Me? Why not?

443
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,709
Who gives a fuck! This bottle
could change my life. -Huh?

444
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:37,993
-This. I'll keep it in a warm,
dry place. Until a big white

445
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,716
mouse grows inside.

446
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:49,630
-What should I do?
Ask her something, you prick.

447
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,399
What? Anything, just ask.

448
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:04,198
-Tell me, this modelling...
-What? -Is that long-term.

449
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,670
I mean, are there prospects?

450
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,157
Oh how original. Come on,
something more imaginative.

451
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,310
Not about modelling or ex-boyfriends.
Tell me, that guy

452
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,758
from the exhibition. -What about him?
-Is that your ex?

453
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:29,758
Did I really say that?
-It was nothing serious.

454
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:36,031
-Bravo Braca, a real genius!
-Sladjana!

455
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,235
-Right, enough. Hey fools,
start the film!

456
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,799
-What you shouting at?
Get out of that chair, idiot.

457
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,350
-Come on man, play the film.
-Come here and play it yourself

458
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,394
if you're so clever. The film operator
saw they'd only sold

459
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,792
three tickets and went home.
He's not a fool like me.

460
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:03,318
Sit there and wait.
-Now I'm going to fuck him.

461
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,355
Do you know how much he stinks, man?
-His ticket doesn't stink.

462
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,630
-Listen, mate, do you drink brandy?
-Brandy, no.

463
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,710
But Vinjak, by the gallon.
-Enough for some Vinjak?

464
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,718
Here, just start the film.
And turn out the lights.

465
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:35,590
And give us some other row.
-We'll sort something out.

466
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:49,671
-And love flew away, like a bird.
-And now Todd Bannister.

467
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,677
-Judgment day! Sladjana,
Sladjana! -What's going on?

468
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,479
-An earthquake.

469
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:12,030
-Interference, I don't know,
dear countrymen...

470
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,628
-Sladjana!

471
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,473
-Hey, get off my TV!

472
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,916
-Everything's ok. Iris likes me.
I'll marry her. We'll have

473
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,710
a ten-room flat in Manhatten.
I'll get an Oscar for editing.

474
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,718
-Manchester have occupied
the Eastwich penalty box.

475
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,752
-Where you going, idiot!

476
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,869
-And what's young Kangaroo up to?
He's off his line, dribbles

477
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,398
past one, two... and a savage assault
by Van Nistelrooy!

478
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,512
Kangaroo's on the ground.
Is there a card, Mr Smith?

479
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,675
-Fuck you, you fucker!
-Referee Smith calls Van Nistelrooy.

480
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,354
Come here, mate,
here's your yellow card.

481
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,198
A recovered Kangaroo takes
his place between the posts.

482
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,835
-That's it boy! For your old mum!
For Serbia!

483
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,716
Ljubica, my peasant,
drinks for the players.

484
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:40,039
-Hey Zile, why's Cile so nasty to Ljubica?
-Because she won't

485
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,277
give him any. -What?

486
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,829
-Come on Ljubica, this isn't
a funeral. -Get off!

487
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,832
That's bad luck.
What did I tell you?

488
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:04,075
-Have you got a watch Mr Smith?
And as if he heard me, the

489
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,478
referee looks at his watch and...
half-time.

490
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:15,190
-Mate, do you reckon more
people would die from an

491
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:20,236
earthquake, or a volcano?
-“..we're trying to reach the

492
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,515
city seismology institute...”
-Don't know mate, never thought

493
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,433
about it.
-“Hello, can you hear us...?”

494
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,839
I reckon an earthquake.
Although I wouldn't fuck with a

495
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,238
volcano. A volcano could wipe
you out in a second.

496
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,997
-It's ok, mate.
-What's ok?

497
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,438
-What's yourfucking problem?
Why are you jinxing us?

498
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,319
-Alright Duje, you
watching the game?

499
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:54,674
-Somi, want to come with me?
-Get some fags.

500
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,630
-Hold on, what about money?
-The shish kebabs have arrived

501
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,470
for our dear guest,
Kangaroo's mother.

502
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,917
-Fucking hell. Why've we got that
radio if it doesn't work?

503
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,833
-Past tense, it used to work,
present tense, it doesn't.

504
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:24,874
-Alright footballers, teams...
-Give me a drag to chill out.

505
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:31,479
My ticker's going to die.
-There isn't any, mate. It's a

506
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,713
worldwide crisis.
The Arabs are holding out.

507
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:42,353
-Lift that aerial,
and move this.

508
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,910
-Please, people, if I take the
cash tonight, I'll bring a

509
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,155
whole crop here. -Man, is this guy
stupid or crazy?

510
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,880
There isn't any, mate.
-Sit down, man, relax.

511
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:09,270
-Miroslav! Have you set up my aerial?
I'll miss the news.

512
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,718
-What d'you reckon, will they give us
some money if they win?

513
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,350
-Like fuck, mate. There's no such
thing as a free lunch.

514
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,194
-Afterthe film I'll take her
to my place. Straight to bed.

515
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,156
Pants! I can't believe I've left
my pants in the middle of

516
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,155
the room! Twat! No problem,
I'll kick them under the bed

517
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,312
and introduce Iris to a world
of sensitivity. Loosen her up

518
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,438
with Baileys. Like fuck!
Svetlana drank it all.

519
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,515
I can't believe I spent a year
with that stupid tart.

520
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,996
-Turn out the lights!
-So, forget the Baileys.

521
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:48,070
Straight to bed! Marvin Gaye in
the background. Cuddling to

522
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,797
some soft black tones.
Wham! Iris all wet, hurtling from

523
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,156
orgasm to orgasm, neighbours on
the balcony, chanting:

524
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,549
Give-it-to-her Braca!

525
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,839
-How could I think it's just
about sex for him?

526
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,073
Braca, my gallant knight!

527
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,957
-Let me see that slip.
Why did you bet on Eastwich?

528
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:22,111
-Good odds. -But Manchester
are Manchester.

529
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:29,511
-But Kangaroo's our mate.
-Did he call you today?

530
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,879
When was the last time he called?

531
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:45,519
He won't call you. You're not on
the same level. It's over.

532
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,913
Forget him, like he forgot us.
-Kangaroo's not like that.

533
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:59,069
-But life is. -What's that?
-Choose.

534
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,994
-So why did you buy the slip?
-I can't help it, I'm already

535
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:15,793
up today. Uncle Cile won't
always be there.

536
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,157
-Take your mate out
to dinner, a bird on your arm.

537
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,473
-I haven't got a bird.
-What about Ljubica?

538
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,317
Uncle Cile knows everything...

539
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,429
-Look how sweet they are.

540
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:43,958
-At least fifty years old and
holding hands. Isn't it lovely?

541
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:53,237
-Zivac, look, there's Braca.
-Look, they're waving to us.

542
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:59,913
-Hello! Say hi to them.
-Do you know them?

543
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,318
-Neighbours from our building.
-That looks like his new

544
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:11,195
girlfriend. Isn't she pretty?
Really pretty, like an angel.

545
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:18,519
Come on Zile, let's say hello.
-Ah, sit down.

546
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,990
-Sorry, I have to go to the toilet.

547
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,277
Where you going? -To say hello.

548
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,917
-Don't look at me. Look at the screen!
What you doing here.

549
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,430
Why aren't you at Mile's?
-To Mile's, then to watch the

550
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,191
football. And we haven't been to
the cinema in twenty years.

551
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,312
-Twenty years, and now you
decide to go to the cinema!

552
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,116
-Braca, are you ashamed of us?
-Oh come on, ma! Look at the

553
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,037
screen. This film isn't for you,
get it? -Is that right?

554
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,549
And why's that? -Because there are
scenes of explicit violence

555
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,151
and even more explicit sex.
That's why. Satisfied? Go home.

556
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,157
-Oh please, for us it's explicit
and for him it isn't.

557
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:13,678
-Slavka, did you turn off the hob?
-I think so.

558
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:22,237
-You did, or you think you did?
-I think I did. -So you didn't.

559
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,919
-Let me introduce myself.
I'm Slavka, Braca's mother.

560
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,438
-Pleased to meet you, I'm Iris.
-Aren't you pretty, Ines.

561
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,274
Like in that song. Braca didn't tell
me he had such a pretty

562
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:53,989
girlfriend. -I'm not his...
-He's very nice. So are you.

563
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:59,909
Just so you know, he recently
finished a long relationship.

564
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:05,194
I didn't think he'd be
so quick to find...

565
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,713
You're a lovely couple, Ines.
-Goodbye.

566
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,152
-Beautiful Iris gets up,
and passing down the left wing

567
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,675
walks out of my life.
-And they're your... -Yes.

568
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,470
-Well why didn't you tell me...
-Because I didn't!

569
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:29,471
-Don't be unkind. I've also just
finished a relationship.

570
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,115
-I don't believe it. And what else
did she bloody tell you?

571
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,357
Did she tell you how I used to piss
the bed till I was seven?

572
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,309
-You know, there's no reason
to get angry with your parents.

573
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,631
-Take them home if you like them.

574
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,760
-My mother wouldn't even have
said hello to you. -Excellent!

575
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,519
-Nor would my father.
-Do you want to swap parents?

576
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,712
-You'd soon change your mind.
They don't talk to anyone.

577
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:58,148
Not even to each other. And when
they do, it's better that

578
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:02,439
they didn't. -What's with the outbursts
of personal stuff?

579
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,470
What does this mean?

580
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,992
I can't believe my mum's pulled
me a bird! Cheers Slavka!

581
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,192
-Alright crazies!
-Alright you estate agent!

582
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:33,039
Hey shift that aerial there.
-Mate, I've got bio-energy.

583
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,439
-You got something to smoke?
-You know what, Avaks, I've

584
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,110
paid my fair share.
-You got some or not?

585
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:47,193
-No, no. This estate agency fucked me.
They pay me nothing.

586
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:04,312
Isn't life beautiful!
-I'll fucking kill you!

587
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:12,638
-Another thirty-eight,
thirty-nine minutes of anguish, hope,

588
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:19,116
suspense. Eastwich have very
little in reserve. Do these

589
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,035
London boys have the strength?

590
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,668
-Come on Eastwich. For Kangaroo,
for Serbia!

591
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,394
-Why have you gone quiet, mate?
Look, he's the bollocks!

592
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,958
-I haven't, mate, what's up?
-Kangaroo, Kangaroo!

593
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:37,789
-Giggs puts over a useful cross.
And, nothing! The young

594
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,313
Kangaroo leapt like a panther
and claimed the ball...

595
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:46,756
-A quick tipple, madam? -Why not.
-Whisky for Mrs Rada.

596
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,394
-This young man has recorded
the most beautiful moments of

597
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,034
his goalkeeping career...
-Give me one as well.

598
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,235
-So you're ditching me
for Gangula this weekend?

599
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,037
-If you think I'm ditching you,
then I'm ditching you.

600
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,676
-A million dinars, mate.

601
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,431
Tonight you drank my million dinars.
-Sorry, man. How was I

602
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:08,992
to know? -It's like you killed me,
tonight you killed me.

603
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:14,719
-Look what your brother
brought for you. -Fuck you.

604
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,677
-The referees, with Mr Smith
at the helm...

605
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,438
-Fuck, they haven't crossed the halfway
line for half an hour.

606
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:32,072
Attack, for fuck's sake! -Free kick to
Manchester, ten metres

607
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:36,439
outside the penalty area.
Just three players in the wall.

608
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,432
-This is going top right.
-If it goes top right, you're top

609
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,475
casualty. -You're mad.
-I'll show you who's bloody mad!

610
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,558
And ask yourself later if I'm
mad and what's my problem.

611
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,279
-Fantastic save by young
Kangaroo. It's his day,

612
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:52,111
the hero, this prince from
the Danube and the Sava.

613
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,875
-Excuse me, madam,
but I have to kiss you.

614
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:14,868
-What's young Kangaroo done now!
-Fuck you, Kangaroo.

615
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,989
-What a careless move,
the price of inexperience.

616
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,789
-Why, Kangaroo, Why?

617
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,599
-Young Kangaroo let himself be
provoked by old Keane, and

618
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,232
spat at him. -He'll get a red card.
-So he should, fucking

619
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:32,789
idiot. Did he learn that at home?
-Shut up!

620
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:38,556
-Mr Smith reaches for his
pocket and...yellow card!

621
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,116
-That's it Smithy,
I could kiss your dick!

622
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,356
-It's ok Kangaroo.
Come on.

623
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,799
-A yellow card forthat!
For spitting, a yellow card!

624
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:55,799
-Now I'm going to fuck him.
Get out! I'll fuck you bad.

625
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:03,318
-Mind the suit. -Ah, Baron,
freshly nicked, huh?

626
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,269
-No, honey,
I've got the label.

627
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,872
How you doing, you got some cash?
-Er, I don't know.

628
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,590
-Your size...
-We'll see, at the end.

629
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,914
-Honey, your size. It's an opportunity!

630
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:33,153
-Sorry, can I use your mobile?
To apologise to my mum.

631
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:45,668
-That would be fine, really.
-Mum, it's me. Sorry, please.

632
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:50,518
Bake me a pie... -Hold on,
why exactly didn't he want to

633
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,269
introduce me. -Thanks.

634
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:01,078
-I'm so stupid. -What now?
Why introduce me if he just

635
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,671
wants to sleep with me and dump me.
-She must be stiff from

636
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:08,675
sitting. -And I'm stiff.
Come on film!

637
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,480
-Oh come on!
-Sladjanaaaa!

638
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:35,712
-Sumpor? -Tell me mate.
-Move that foot, please.

639
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,429
-Why?
-It stinks, mate.

640
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,078
-You know why, because I'm
in my shoes all day, I work.

641
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,755
First I was in Zemun, then in Medak,
all day on the bus.

642
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:55,110
-Great, well done. Just move it,
I can't stand it. -Fuck you!

643
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:02,079
-Miroslav, you there? -He's here!
Your granddad's calling.

644
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,995
-Suck my dick. Ok, grandpa,
just fixing it now.

645
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,151
-Pass the joint!

646
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,868
Mate, why don't you fix
the aerial for your granddad?

647
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:24,511
Why you laughing? You too?
Why don't you two do something?

648
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,111
You're 26 years old, and you sit
there all day talking crap.

649
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,155
-Why can't you get it that I'm
at my most useful sitting here.

650
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:39,310
-Me too. -I've got no income,
and I've got no outgoings.

651
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:52,313
-Pass the joint. Right, let's call
some birds. -What birds?

652
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:56,238
-I don't know, some birds.
Let's call Branka.

653
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,676
-Branka got married, idiot.

654
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,156
-Ok, we won't call Branka.

655
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,200
-Sixty-first, sixty-second
minute of the game.

656
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,915
Manchester' attackers are lining up.

657
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,956
-Come on! Who's Zile?
-The greatest player...

658
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:28,675
-And? -The greatest lover -And?
-The greatest football expert.

659
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:36,316
-Hi Zivac. -What's up Mile?
190 over 100! You did well!

660
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,950
Next time I'll get you 300
over 200! Fucking Manchester.

661
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,796
-Roma-Atalanta finished.
-What did I tell you?

662
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:52,551
-And entering the game is
number 27 minutes! Sorry, my

663
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,076
mistake, 27 minutes to go.

664
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,675
-Mate, why you shitting yourself?
It'll be ok.

665
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:08,915
Attack, Eastwich, wherever
you play, we're there...

666
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:09,951
-Young Kangaroo brings down
the Flying Dutchman in the penalty

667
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,078
area! A careless challenge,
the price of inexperience! You

668
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:18,919
can't do that Kangaroo, not in Europe.
-He went for the ball.

669
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:24,435
-Europe's strict. And what's Mr Smith
given now? A penalty?

670
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:33,270
-Fuck you, and the electricity company.
-What's going on mate?

671
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:40,395
-Thank god, now the film.
It'll be fine. We'll hold hands.

672
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,438
She'll kiss me. She'll like the film.
It'll inspire to make

673
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:48,350
something similar. My life is
finally going somewhere.

674
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:59,192
-Come on, Mile, start it!
Why you stripping? -Fuck you!

675
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:31,311
-The harshest punishment, after all!
-Oh Kangaroo, I'll fuck

676
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,950
your species of kangaroo.
-Defend him, people!

677
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:39,196
-Defend my arse. -And the
ruthless Paul Scholes

678
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:44,794
approaches. Casually places the ball.
A hushed Mansfield Road.

679
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:50,151
Paul Scholes and Kangaroo,
head-to-head. Tensions rising.

680
01:01:54,640 --> 01:02:02,320
-The skies open, Kangaroo saves.
Holy father and mother!

681
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:13,469
-One-one! -How come one-one
when he saved it? How come?

682
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:20,716
-Alas father, alas mother,
Kangaroo carried the ball

683
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:29,590
across the line.
Oh, the price of inexperience.

684
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,678
-Did anyone ever tell you that
you gave birth to an idiot?

685
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:39,875
-Oh, fuck you, kiss my arse.
-What inexperience!

686
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:56,437
-The film is cancelled, power cut.
Follow me.

687
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,316
-Let's go.

688
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,917
-Fuck you, fuck you all.

689
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:22,709
The first time I take a girl
to yourfucking cinema!

690
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:25,514
And everything fucks up!

691
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:27,389
-Braca, what's wrong?

692
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,757
-What's wrong? Does it bother
you that I've fallen in love?

693
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:38,155
Does it bother you that you've
screwed up the most beautiful

694
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:44,629
day of my life!
-Help!

695
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:55,598
-Here's your numbered seat,
go fuck him.

696
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:08,753
-Now I'm going to fuck you.
Did I miss Kangaroo just for you,

697
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,236
you little bastard.

698
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:23,557
Ouch, my eyes, my eyes.
I can't see! -He's killing him!

699
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:33,709
-The shame! Braca King of Shame!
Let the electricity come

700
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,355
back so this tram can hit me!

701
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:43,351
-We'll go to his place, and we'll screw.
On the first date?

702
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,712
Of course! Sex at first sight!
Because to us it's not the most

703
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:53,639
important thing. Wait! Does it hurt?
-No, I'll do it.

704
01:04:56,360 --> 01:05:04,597
-I sprayed him with deodorant.
-I'm going to wash my face.

705
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,272
-You were a pussy at the cinema.
Come on, get the balls

706
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,875
to ask her to your place.
What did we say? Braca's got balls,

707
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:20,635
Braca's the man! I can't believe
what's happening to me.

708
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:38,238
I've got saggy breasts. No hair.
That's why I've got

709
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:43,630
moles. Thousands of bloody moles.
I can't sunbathe.

710
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:47,317
Haven't got any money for
the coast anyway. Nor will I have

711
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:48,914
anyone to go with when
beautiful Iris dumps me and

712
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,710
flies off with some beautiful
models. I've got a belly.

713
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:57,712
I'm 27. I don't work. I live with
my parents, and nothing

714
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:11,597
will change for 50 years.
Or maybe it will, for the worse.

715
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,390
-Where's your shirt?
-Pardon?

716
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:23,914
You know what, I don't care
about the shirt. I'm a useless

717
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:27,750
social parasite.
Fuck my shirt.

718
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:36,350
I'm a louse, heading into my own
lousy world, to live my own

719
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:41,874
lousy life, to die and be
buried in a lousy grave.

720
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:51,478
-You ok?
-No, I'm not ok.

721
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:05,992
-What a drama. -Mile, that stinks!
-What a tragedy.

722
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,559
-A Russian military generator!

723
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,436
-Hitchcock couldn't direct this.
Decline of the Gods!

724
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,716
-Five minutes left, plus injury time.
Remember when Leeds...

725
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:18,272
-Shut it, Burgija.
-Your brother's waiting outside.

726
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:22,917
-Watch my suit, please.
-Ljubica, pour me another.

727
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:28,832
-Manchester deserve more
than a draw. -Out for Eastwich...

728
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:39,318
-Fucking prick!
-Mate, don't worry, it's ok.

729
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,991
-What's ok, did you see it?
What a moron.

730
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,953
-Are you cold? -No.
-Why did I say I'm not cold?

731
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:54,111
-What a stupid question.
Of course he's cold. -Thousands of

732
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,670
plans. Thousands of beautiful plans,
and all ruined.

733
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,752
Fuck, I tried to pull Naomi Campbell.
I can't believe this.

734
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,754
The bum and Naomi. Good name
for a film. The bum and Naomi.

735
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,435
Scene One: 60-year-old Braca
lives with 100-year-old parents

736
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,519
Cut. They're eating through straws.
On the TV, Brad Pitt

737
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,279
getting on Oscar. Out runs crying Iris.
They kiss while I

738
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,797
break down. The Oscar in her hands.
Big. Cut to a chainsaw.

739
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,439
Cut. Braca advances on his
helpless parents with the

740
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:18,588
chainsaw. Music climaxes.
What am I saying? Thousands of

741
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,912
uncontrolled thoughts. Fuck,
I'm having a nervous breakdown.

742
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:25,829
-No more time, no more time for anything.
-Fuck me if I'm ever

743
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:33,550
going to a bookies again.
-It's futile. The midfield was

744
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,633
completely subdued, lacking in attack,
lacking in defence.

745
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,552
Fortune has turned her back.
Young Zoran Paunovic is the one

746
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:43,199
bright side.
-Hi Gangula!

747
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:49,158
-Hey people, what's up? Who's playing?
-Fuck off! -Ok, Zivac.

748
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,718
-...you can't do it like that
in the home of the ladybird,

749
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:57,470
underthe flag of Gordi Albion.
As the Brits say:

750
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:02,391
God Save Kangaroo, god save
the queen from this football.

751
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,637
-Hey shut the door, or I'll break
both your legs and arms.

752
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,958
-Dragan!
-Gangula, mate!

753
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:17,996
-How's it going, man?
-Good, Where's Cile?

754
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:22,399
-Don't know, mate, he was here.
-Where is he?

755
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:39,193
-Oh, come on Dragan.
-Where's Cile, my little ones?

756
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,755
-Mate, this is tight.

757
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:01,399
-Is anything ever going to happen?
-Go get some beer,

758
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:03,790
something might happen
to you on the way.

759
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,278
-Got any cash? -Banjaluka will
put it on the tab.

760
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:13,913
-Why me? He'll run a tab for
you too -Mate, I have to fix

761
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:18,751
the aerial. -“You're listening to B92...”
-Oh, yeah.

762
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:42,235
Hello? What's going on?
-This is seriously good weed.

763
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:46,309
-Let's get some beer,
this is making me thirsty.

764
01:10:56,360 --> 01:11:02,196
-Braca's bird, guys! -Silence.
-Thanks.

765
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:06,030
-Gangula, mate. -Give me a juice.
-Coming up.

766
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:19,553
-Gangula, champ. We're watching
Kangaroo, the match, Gangula.

767
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:26,311
One minute to go. -Shut up.
You can see there's a crisis in the

768
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:50,158
Middle East. -Fuck you.
I have to go.

769
01:11:54,480 --> 01:12:01,079
-Where are you going?
-To get some juice. -Not you.

770
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,278
Where's Cile? -I don't know,
Dragan, I swear.

771
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,831
-Gangula, please, just one minute.
-Are you nuts?

772
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:11,312
-Why don't you let us
watch the game. Do you hear me?

773
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:19,319
-Madam, leave the premises.
-Me leave the premises? No.

774
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,232
-Aunt Rada.
-Leave me alone.

775
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:30,359
-Gangula, mate, it's ok.
This is Kangaroo's mum.

776
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:40,798
-Somi, mate.
What is this?

777
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:48,034
-Come here. Don't make me
come after you, gypsy. Hear me?

778
01:12:48,400 --> 01:13:00,073
-Somi, mate, two-one!
-The skies have opened.

779
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:15,236
Belgrade has erupted. This is crazy!
-How you doing, Cikotic!

780
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:19,076
-Gangula, kill me, fuck me,
do what you want.

781
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:29,470
-The end! Mr Smith blows
the final whistle. Moments to

782
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:30,716
savour on the most beautiful
pages of footballing history.

783
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,032
-Come on Gangula, hit me!

784
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,670
-Rejoice young Zoran Paunovic Kangaroo,
the new star of the

785
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:42,590
footballing firmament,
the new god between the posts.

786
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:49,789
The homegrown Serbian son,
Prince of the Danube and Sava.

787
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:19,790
-There's only one Mrs Rada!

788
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:47,918
-Fuck, this is for my late father,
my mum, and Ljubica!

789
01:14:51,000 --> 01:15:01,035
-A lake and a crate, and a crate
and lake, and life is...

790
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,437
-So, it's eitherthe betting
slip orthe 500 euros.

791
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:49,918
And I took the cash.
-What have you done?

792
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,871
-A miracle. A miracle needs to
happen for me to pull her.

793
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,073
-Banjaluka doesn't work Sunday
evenings so we went to this guy

794
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:06,832
who never runs a tab.
-But he did tonight. What's up?

795
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:11,195
-I saw a flying saucer.
-Where is it? -It flew off.

796
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:20,158
-Cool. What a trip!
-Do you hear what I'm saying?

797
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:25,874
I saw a flying saucer!
-Is this weed working for you?

798
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:30,792
-Hey Avaks, how come you
always see everything? You saw when

799
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,470
Prasak was killed, when Mad Zeks
jumped out the window,

800
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:37,676
when Duje grabbed the
chemist teacher's arse, when

801
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,917
Banjaluka's Mercedes caught fire.
-When Mira gave Gangula a

802
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:45,229
blowjob in his car. -How come you
always see, and we don't?

803
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:49,196
-Mate, that's your problem.
-What did it look like?

804
01:16:55,400 --> 01:17:01,191
-It was blue, and when it
turned it disappeared.

805
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:04,314
-No shit?
-Fuck you.

806
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:07,399
-Mate, do you know how big
Belgrade is? And only you saw a

807
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,798
flying saucer. Does that tell
you anything? -Yeah. -What?

808
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,874
-That I've seen a fucking
flying saucer.

809
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:18,193
-Why are you lying?
-You're bloody blind.

810
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:23,758
-Old man, did you see it too?
-Of course! -What did you see?

811
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:28,158
-A secret, a military secret.

812
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:37,711
-Old man, you want a beer, mate?
-Sure, a quick one.

813
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:53,911
-It's ok. Let it go.
-You're really not angry?

814
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:58,438
-No mate, it's ok.

815
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:04,518
-Look mate,
there's 500 euros.

816
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:19,709
-Get lost, you fucker!

817
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:23,476
-Mate, I know Avaks sees
everything, but he did see it.

818
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,835
We weren't smoking, mate.
We've got another witness. You don't

819
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,430
think he was smoking?

820
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:33,550
-What do you reckon,
was there an alien inside? -No idea.

821
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,558
The Russians put dogs in
the first rockets. -No shit.

822
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,117
-I swear. -Why dogs?
-If something happens, better

823
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:43,479
to fry a dog than a man.
-Think there's some cosmic dog inside?

824
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:47,229
-Maybe.
-Imagine the trip!

825
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:52,792
-Avaks, one more minute and
we're rich. -What do you mean?

826
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:56,033
-You saw a flying saucer, man.
You'll be famous. And when

827
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:59,079
you're famous, you're rich. It
all comes together.

828
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,516
-A strange night in town.
An earthquake, a power-cut,

829
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:11,436
interference. And now witnesses
to an unusual event in the sky.

830
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:16,629
-Yes, that's it. There it is.
-Sreten Zujkic, pensioner.

831
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,549
-Listeners, live on our
programme is a fellow citizen

832
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,154
who witnessed an unusual event
in the sky. Tell us exactly

833
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:31,908
what you saw. -It was a bluish mass,
magma, moving, and

834
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:35,272
then suddenly disappeared.
-Where? -I think it went in the

835
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:40,919
direction of Grocka. -That's great.
Was it a flying saucer?

836
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:49,436
-What's with 500 million
unregistered Chinese, huh?

837
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:58,393
Nothing! 500 million! They're
digging tunnels, holes, to

838
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:03,960
Moscow, Paris, London,
Washington. World globalisation

839
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:08,712
is waging war against
the entire planet.

840
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,680
-He looks like he's on hard drugs.
-And who brought down

841
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:17,791
the Berlin wall? Who privatised Slovakia,
and where's the

842
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,437
hand of Jesus. I invite all of
advanced mankind to understand

843
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:29,593
there is no Third World War,
there wasn't even a Second.

844
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:37,077
Mankind is sleeping. -Hello, Sir?
-Oh for fuck's sake!

845
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:38,995
-What's wrong? -What's wrong?
You're supposed just to confirm

846
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,592
you saw a flying saucer. -I did see it.
-So why didn't you say?

847
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:48,838
-I thought I did.
-Fuck you, idiot.

848
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:54,037
-You know what, go fuck yourself!
You deserve

849
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:58,393
globalisation and the hole
in the ozone layer. Go to sleep!

850
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:04,198
-Hello? Well of course they
cut us off. You idiot!

851
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,032
-It's no good. I don't have the
nerves for this. I've lost

852
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:13,875
three tonnes of nerves today...
Why am I tripping?

853
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:17,240
She's next to me, she likes me.
Everything's ok. Now we're

854
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:19,471
going to stop a cab, go to my place,
put on Marvin Gaye, and

855
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:25,113
that's that. Where's my money?
No! I gave it to that bald

856
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:28,756
bloke for bloody brandy.
Baldy's ruined my life.

857
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:32,838
-Do you need money?
-No. I don't sell out for money!

858
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:37,991
I'm an artist, I don't give a fuck
about money. And I don't

859
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:41,830
give a fuck about your fucking
fashion, your stylists, lifting

860
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:45,352
and peeling. I don't give a shit
about your diets, your

861
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:49,076
books or your looks, back-stagers!
I'm sick of fashion

862
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:53,029
and your shit about fashion.
And I'm sick of the bloody TV

863
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:56,557
programmes, stupid presenters
talking shit about fashion and

864
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:01,955
some projects all day. I'm sick of
those projects. I don't care

865
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,038
where you've been and where
you'll have your next show, I

866
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,869
don't care about who takes care
of your look. I'm not going to

867
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,556
suck up to some idiot for money.
You models can fuck

868
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:18,430
yourselves. Fu-ck your-selves!
I can't believe what I said.

869
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:28,188
Sorry, I don't know what to say.
-You don't need to say

870
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:30,392
anything else to me.

871
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:54,196
-Hey, Tarzan, you getting in?
-No, he's not. -Sladjanaaa!

872
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:02,312
-Thanks for coming. -No problem
I came because of work.

873
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:08,232
-I know. You know that 50 euros
I owe you, I'll have it by the

874
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:13,237
end of the week, in principle,
definitely, in principle.

875
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:26,354
-You're fucking me! Not only
am I working overtime, I'm

876
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,719
working in the middle of nowhere.

877
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:39,394
-Excuse me, are you from the centre?
-Get lost, Bighead.

878
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:42,318
Let's do the sound check.

879
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,869
-What's your problem?
Just three sentences, mate. Just

880
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:48,798
what you saw. You'll be the first
Serb to see a flying

881
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:53,233
saucer. You'll be celebrated!
-Viewers, here we are in...

882
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,188
-I don't want to be famous.
-How come?

883
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:56,469
-Sumpor, give me that
bird's number, please.

884
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:58,114
-Fine, I will. Go away.
Everyone wants to be famous!

885
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:03,076
-I don't. -Ok, you don't want to be
famous. But you want the

886
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,311
cash! -Yeah. -Well there's no cash
without fame. They come

887
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:10,754
together. -What about Banjaluka.
-Yes, but he

888
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:13,230
squeezes minced meat all day
and stinks of charcoal. Do you

889
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,869
want to stink of charcoal?
-I don't want that either.

890
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:19,279
Viewers, we're in a Vozdovac
tower block...

891
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,433
Sasa, is it ready?
-Just a minute, Makili.

892
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,910
-Excuse me, how big is this?
-Hey, Makili, get rid of

893
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:29,477
this thickhead, I'm going to punch him.
-Lad, please don't.

894
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:36,232
-Alright, what's yourfucking problem?
-Understand mate, I

895
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,753
won't... -What won't you, what?
-Embarrass myself.

896
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:43,272
-What embarrassment, mate? To earn
some cash, become popular.

897
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:50,188
-We'll earn fuck all! Someone,
I don't know who or why,

898
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:53,234
doesn't want it to be known
that flying saucers exist.

899
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:57,150
They tell the stupid people
that they're all flashes,

900
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:02,158
weather balloons, or some shit.
But they can't lie to me, I

901
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,509
know what I saw.
-You're bloody crazy!

902
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:10,154
-Mate, do they pay your social?
-Shall we, mate?

903
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:12,876
-We shall!
Mate, come here.

904
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:15,998
-Mate, are you going to give
a statement? -About what?

905
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:18,874
-About my dick!
About the flying saucer, fool.

906
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:22,158
-And Avaks? -Yes or no?
-I didn't see anything!

907
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:42,431
-The heat's a killer, huh?
-Killer, mate.

908
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:52,315
-Hey, Braca, did you get laid?

909
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:06,154
-Did you win any money?
-Kind of, mate, yes and no.

910
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:18,790
-We're fucked, mate, fucked.
You know that feeling when...

911
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:31,554
I'm going home. Mum's made some pie.
-What you doing later?

912
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:38,234
-Dunno, maybe hanging myself.
-Come to the roof later.

913
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,035
-That bird's really fucked him.

914
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:50,756
-What I'd give to be
fucked up by some bird.

915
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:56,435
-Viewers, here we are in a
Vozdovac tower block, with a

916
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:59,952
magnificent view over a
sun-drenched Belgrade, of course,

917
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,197
when it's not night. With us is
our young fellow citizen

918
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:05,592
Aleksandar Kovacevic.
-Sumpor, mate, Sumpor.

919
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,629
-Sasa, what exactly did you see?

920
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:17,439
-It's still difficult for me to...
It really was amazing.

921
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,876
This is a great day for mankind.
The physicists,

922
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:23,477
astronomers and philosophers
are wrong. There is life beyond

923
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,310
earth. I saw a
flying saucer.

924
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:35,633
We were sitting here
smoking dope, err..Dunhill.

925
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:48,708
-Where exactly? -I was sitting here.
At one moment I glanced

926
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:56,232
at the sky and saw a bluish light,
like some magma. It

927
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:59,593
turned around like this,
and suddenly disappeared.

928
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,314
-Hey bighead, don't stand on
my cables. -What, you pussy! You

929
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:03,989
came here to show off in my
neighbourhood! -Don't mate.

930
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:13,718
-He thinks he's some big shot
if he works on TV. If you don't

931
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:14,870
like it here, why did you come?
To show off?

932
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:20,639
-Why you fucking me, mate?
-Well fuck you too, Sumpor!

933
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:30,311
They're insulting our neighbourhood,
and you're

934
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:31,198
talking shit, patronizing.
I'll shit on your flying saucers.

935
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,030
-You know what, you can't work
with peasants. -Shall we?

936
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:36,355
-We shall. So, that shining bluish object,
shining in the

937
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:39,478
sky, like some lunar-park in the sky,
and weird sounds, like

938
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:45,238
some heavenly symphony.
-So they're intelligent beings.

939
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:49,713
-They're well ahead of us.
They were trying to tell us

940
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:53,430
something with those audio-visual
vibrations. -What?

941
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:04,956
-That we're here, and they're there,
so why not offer the

942
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:11,914
hand of friendship.
-Pack up the equipment. -Why?

943
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,876
I mean, I saw it, really.

944
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,391
-We interrupt the music for a news
flash. We're getting calls

945
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:24,038
from listeners around Kosmaj.
They say that an unidentified

946
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,313
flying object has appeared above
Sopot, but we can't

947
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:30,110
contact our reporter...
-Don't say we're going to

948
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:35,117
Kosmaj now.
Give me that cable.

949
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:41,989
-Hey, Sumpor, you promised me
that girl's number.

950
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:48,199
-You know what, that...

951
01:29:54,360 --> 01:30:01,436
-Ciuvavaaaaaa
-Sladjanaaa

952
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:05,191
-Fuck me, is this Sladjana
ever going to respond?

953
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,473
-Get in touch Sladja!
-...the latest information.

954
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:13,192
The army has blocked the route
to Kosmaj. Our reporter Radovan

955
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:17,993
is at the scene, at the heart of
the Kosmaj mountain...

956
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,994
-I guess you didn't get
any money?

957
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:41,039
-We don't need much money.
All we need is beer and fags. To

958
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:45,115
take out a bird.
-You don't have a bird, fool.

959
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:48,678
-I don't have a bird, but my
blood pressure's normal.

960
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:54,797
120 over 80. I sit on the roof with
my mates and don't give a

961
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:58,789
fuck about anything!
-Cheers!

962
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,509
-Avaks saw a flying saucer.

963
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:14,192
-What did you see?
-A flying saucer.

964
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:21,159
-Are you shitting us? -No.
-When, mate, where?

965
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:26,358
-You guys actually pissed on
me today from up here.

966
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:38,030
-We got beer, but not fags.

967
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:57,834
-This is from my mum. Eat up,
what's wrong with you? Pie.

968
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:10,150
Fuck, I was thinking, mates from
the neighbourhood, we know

969
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:16,351
each other ourwhole lives, but what
do you know about me, huh?

970
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:29,834
-Chill out, mate. Have a beer.
-Sure, that'll do.

971
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:41,079
-Sladjanaaa! -There is no Sladjana!
So stop calling her!

972
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:43,317
-Did you escort yourfriends out?
-Fuck you!

973
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:46,990
-Did Makili say hi to me?
-Leave my pressure cuff alone!

974
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:59,430
What happened? Is it my fault?
Did I screw up?

975
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:06,035
-No, mate. I screwed up.
And it hurts.

976
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:19,273
-Hey, mate, Avaks saw a flying saucer.
-I mean, seriously.

977
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,837
-Sladjana!

978
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:32,872
-Iris!

979
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:51,158
-Try with this,
she'll hear you better.

980
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,439
-Hello.

981
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:10,392
How did you know it was me?

982
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:14,953
No, I'm not cold, I got dressed.
I wanted to ask, do

983
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,517
You want to go to the cinema
with me tonight? No, another...

984
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,751
-Good luck, mate.

985
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:43,240
-Branka!

986
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:53,794
-Ljubica!

987
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:05,070
-Marija!

988
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:17,795
-Tanja!

989
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:37,468
-Dusan!

990
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:40,918
-I knew you were queer?
-I'm not, why?

991
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:43,669
-Well, who's the Dusan guy?
-A friend from nursery.

01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:54,428
