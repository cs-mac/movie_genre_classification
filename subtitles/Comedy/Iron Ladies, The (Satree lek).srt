Siam Museum

2
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,770
Why do you like to take this kind of photos?

3
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,520
I like close-up photos because

4
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:01,140
They lead us to see something...
that we cannot see if we look widely

5
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,820
So When you shoot face close-up picture...

6
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,380
Where is your focal point?

7
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,760
They maybe eyes

8
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,940
Excuse me, my little baby is crying

9
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,130
So handsome

10
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,300
Too bad he's already had a baby

11
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,300
How are you my son? Why are you crying?

12
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,790
You must have been hungry

13
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,410
You look so angry

14
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,210
Haaeee Don't be mad at me

15
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,230
"All of us"

16
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:42,180
"have someone who is hidden in the bottom of the heart"

17
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,600
"When we think of him, we will feel like umm.."

18
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,580
"Always feel a little pain inside"

19
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,250
"But we still want to keep him"

20
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,750
"Even though I don't know where he is today.."

21
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,690
"What is he doing"

22
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,480
"But he is the one who makes me know this"

23
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,060
"A little thing called LOVE"

24
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,150
Mario Maurer

Pimchanok Luevisedpibool

26
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,780
I get it, why you ask us to visit this shop everyday is because of this

27
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,070
Because of what!!!
His motorbike is so strange

28
00:02:53,250 --> 00:03:01,070
Hey...Look at her, she is this beautiful

29
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,790
Look at her

30
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,400
He is super smart, it's not weird that you would crazy about him

31
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,990
Are you non-sense? I don't

32
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,190
Mom, Fried rice and breakfast at this table

33
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:57,180
Nam, after you serve that table go to the market for me?

34
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:57,490
Sure

35
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,970
Umm Cute

36
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,890
How are things at School?

37
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,870
Good, I'm still with Cheer Gie Nim

38
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,980
Aren't you bored with each other? You've been with them since Grade 1

39
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:18,650
She has no choice, The appearance like P'Nam and the gang,
No one would like to be with

40
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:27,560
Friends are friends not because of only appearance

41
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,280
But it should be the first thing to consider

42
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,650
I'm lucky that I look like mom

43
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,090
If I looked like dad like P'Nam....

44
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,800
I surely couldn't have boyfriend when I grow up

45
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,380
Hey.... Stop Stop

46
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,440
You have grown up, but still have a quarrel

47
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:56,590
Pang you too, Don't speak about dad like this
If he know, he will be sad

48
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,920
Go to where you want

49
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,470
Dad is in America, he cannot hear us

50
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,310
Mangoes?

51
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,860
You want mangoes?

52
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,380
New Grade 10 students are all smart

53

Yes, we studied at girl school since kindergarten, so boring

54
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,360
Have you calculated it?

55
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,530
Nim got 28

56
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:04,790

You'll be warmed So.. He should be

57
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,580
P'Tom, the leader of Buddhist club

58
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,170
Cheer's is 15

59

Umm who is he?

68
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,510
When it is an English class, you guys look saturnine huh?

69
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,990
Be cheerful like when you're in the lunch time

70
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,880
Don't smile Nam

71
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,470
You're good at English subject

72
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,090
but for other subjects

73
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,870

Pass the lyrics to your classmate

78
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:37,670
His name is Shone, a grade 10 freshman

79
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:41,570
But his past is so terrible, he's wicked

80
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,300
That's not true?

81
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:52,690
Students, for Inspiration you change A to E

82

Two girls had to resign from school because of him, a danger boy
(I don't believe)

84
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,100

103
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,940
Who did this?

104
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,830
"It's because of you that come to me"

105
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,900
"To stay in my heart every night and day"

106
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,390
"The world has pathway"
"This world has stairs"

107
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,000
"Has love and heart"
"That lead us to meet each other"

108
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,700
"In this world"

109
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,930
"Has two of us"

110
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,970
You're good
When will you register as a school forward player?

111
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,250
Playing like this everyday is fun enough

112
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,270
You're still scared? Let's continue to play then..

Hey, I'll be back

00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,980
Who is that girl?

Where?

118
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,310
What she's thinking she is, P'Shone has to go for her

119
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,000
It may be the girl whose P'shone used to...

120
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,680
No way!!!

121

Eh Pang, it's you

128
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,430
Haven't seen you in a long time, but your hair still has bad smell

129
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:18,950
Eh Nam, You've grown up a lot

130
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,450
Eh, Pim!!

131
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,540
You're asleep?

132
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,500
Yes, I still cannot adapt myself from the America flight

133
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,890
No

134
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,910
Is my dad fat like you?

135
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,930
He works as a chef assistant

136
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:44,350
He has to lift food tray, he has muscle

137
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,180
He also give you picture

138

00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,450
want to tell you that he will send money at the end of this month

142
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,490

143
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,030

145
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,210
Pim and daughters, be patient

146
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,960
Dad should come to visit us

147
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:33,260
(normal voice) Your dad told me that
If one of you get the 1st result in the exam

148
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,000
He will send a plane ticket from the US

149
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,480
but the ticket is expensive

150
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,840
Will he really send it to us?

151
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:48,960
because he know that this is very difficult for Pang and Nam

152
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,650
Let's see

153
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,910
I will get the 1st ranking

154
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,910
You will see, dad

155
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,530

Why did you do like this?

161
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,550
Sorry girl, I'm tired, I'm thirsty
Do you have problem?

162
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,160
We're the school team

163
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,890
Have you heard....

164

166
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,320
Aunt, 4 glasses of Pepsi for football players

167
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,430
Is Pepsi ok?

168
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,750
Yes

169
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,180
Damn it

170
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,200
Hey

171
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
You're spreading the dirt on me

172
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,450
Sorry
Understand?

173
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,220
Hey, let me do this

174
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,910
Nam Nam Nam

175
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,350
They're fighting at the back of the school

176
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,450
STOP STOP STOP

177
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:36,160
Nam, where're you going? The motorbike is faster

178
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,950
Hurry

179
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,250
I think you can do this

180
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:56,090
You want to be the province hero like your father?

181
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,000
You dad couldn't kick the penalty goal successfully

182
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,560
Hey you guys know what...

183
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,110
our province didn't get the national trophy

184
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,110
because of his Father!

185
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,030
We couldn't find the opportunity like this anymore

186
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,030
Damn his father

187
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,220
Unfortunately they're gone, I want to see P'ding get punched

188
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,400
Let's go back

189
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:50,460
Will you drink this pepsi that P'shone give you?
Why not throw away if you won't drink

190
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,810
(Don't Drink!!)

191
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,640
If that so, why put it in the refrigerator

192
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:41,670
Ok students, today I have two things to announce

193
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:46,640
Our school is so dirty because
students don't drop garbage in cans

194
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,280
From now on, you will have to pay fees

195
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,800
1 piece, 1 Baht

196
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,420
You think it's too expensive?

197
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,830
I give you a new promotion package

198
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,340
throw all day, throw anywhere, do it

199
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,130
Pay for all the pieces, 50 Baht

200
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,260
Throw it scatteringly, I will clean it up

201
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,450
After this morning standing

202
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,450
Students whose name are on this list

203
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,930
Go to the ruling administer room urgently

204
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,280
Jakkawan M.4/5

205
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,500
and Ashawin M.4/7

206
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,230
cross the arms!!

207
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,890
If you fight each other again

208
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,890
I will call your parents

209
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,960
Understand?

210
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,740
Especially you, Shone

211
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,070
You have some skill for taking pictures

212
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,010
Now, The province has pictures contest

213
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,630
You should go to register
Maybe you will make some reputation to school

214
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,420
It's better than a quarrel

215
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,270
Understand?

216
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,040
Yes

217
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,560
You can go now

218
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,560
Thank you teacher

219
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,880
The next queue!!

220
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,890
P'......I umm

221
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,890
Yesterday..

222
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,890
I'm sorry

223
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,210
It's ok

224
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,750
It's not because of you

225
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,280
Plaster...

226
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,670
Get well soon

227
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,490
Nam

228
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,530
Thank you

229
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:48,750
Hey, P'Shone know my name
He know my name

00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,620
He know my name

231
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,610
Hey look at this

232
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,460
This shop has this kind of book?

233
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,760
20 Methods
Get senior to be your 'boy friend'

234
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,450
There they go, white ribbon gang

235
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,410
I'll be back

236
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,410
Look at her

237
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,890
When does she be friends with that gang?

238
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,470
(Get to the 1st in exam)

239
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,030
Are you for real?

240
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,480
Yes

241
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,480
I miss my dad

242
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,350
Never seen him for 5 years

243
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,840
Earn

244
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,390
P'Kai has confessed love to me

245
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,900
Because of this book!

246
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,240
Is it true?

247
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,610
This book works?

248
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:42,900
Yes

249
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,820
before Pooh becomes P'Tor girlfriend

250
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,840
she also bought this book
"9 recipe of love (for students)"

251
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,240
It really worked for her

252
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,640
Aww, don't you go with that gang?

253
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,200
No

254
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,160
I walked with them
but they blamed me that I stole the scene

255
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:06,700
The 1st method

256
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,380
win his heart by The Greek's belief

257
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,890
Go to the place where you can see many stars on the sky

258
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,890
Then, use your finger draw the line connecting stars

259
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,550
as the abbreviation of your man

260
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,840
Get out of my way

261
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,820
Look at them, wow

262
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,820
I won't step there then, the area is full!!

263
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,280
Hey, Nam

264
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,790
Don't you want to draw with us?

265
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,810
No, I won't

266
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,850
I think, it looks non-sense

267
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,270
Um, they are clearly seen

268
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,510
I will go to draw it at my home

269
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,880
I'll go, Nam
See you

270
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,710
"The only star"

271
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,070
"that I always wait to see everyday"

272
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,780
"I want it to be the same star..."

273
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:16,530
"that you also keep an eye on"

274
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,430
"that only star"

275
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,410
Oh! You guys are diligent

276
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,840
Where are you going to compete?

277
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,970
compete around here

278
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,340
You catch it!

279
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,340
Hey, my hands are not free

280
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,820
I told you, my hands not free
kick for what(E-san's accent)

281
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,280
You are Chinese?

282
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,720
Uh, I'm sorry

283
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,720
When I'm angry, I think about my ancestors

284
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:45,990
Hey, look at this

285
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:50,220
Look at this
come on Shone

286
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:56,260
The poster for the 3rd photo contest that you asking for

287
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,150
Look at him

288
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:04,640
He always Play
Play can play all day

289
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,440
But he doesn't dare to play for the school

290
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,610
He plays for fun, he's not serious

291
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,520
If he's serious, He will not dare

292
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,290
If only I could score that penalty kick

293
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,230
Again, you blame yourself again

294
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,650
Our son may not afraid of taking penalty kick

295
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,210
even though, his friends tease him about it

296
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,550
Or, if he's really afraid

297
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,960
He will pass the fear one day

298
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,240
Look at the real person who missed the kick

299
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:37,920
He can pass that bad time till today

300
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,610
Why you look strange today?

301
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,130
This

302
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,750
My doctor suggested me

303
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,430
He want me to use this new dental brace

304
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,990
Beautiful right?

305
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,260
Eh You think it's beautiful?

306
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,250
It's not beautiful at all

307
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:01,010
Hey, look at it again

308
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,710
I don't see it's beautiful

309
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:08,090
Hey, you intend to do it with P'Ken

310
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:08,940
Yes

311
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,980
YOU HAVE TO EAT, EAT

312
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,300
EAT,EAT,EAT

313
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,400
Yeah, P'Ken has eaten the rice

314
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,980
You're crazy

315
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,440
It's because he's eating

316
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
How can you call it hypnotization

317
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,440
What are you two doing?

318
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,570
This, The 2nd method

319
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,900
It's the old method from Mayan

320
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,490
we have to concentrate our mind

321
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,280
Then, look at our beloved

322
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,280
Try to control his mind

323
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,010
Tell him to do things we want

324
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,850
If he follows our command

325
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,670
it means that he is our soul mate
(Turn this way, Turn this way)

326
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,410
(Turn, Turn)

327
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,910
Hey, P' has turned to me

328
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,830
Who? Who's turned? Nam?

329
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,590
No, It's nothing

330
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,680
Did you hypnotize P'Shone?

331
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,010
Hey No, are you crazy?
I didn't

332
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:07,840
So, why did you tell us
This book is non-sense?

333
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:14,540
because, it takes beliefs from
many countries, that island, this island

334
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,780
It surely cannot be trusted

335
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,520
Then, did you follow the methods?

336
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,210
Yes, I did

337
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:17,810
Eyy

338
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,320
You shouldn't disclose this little matter

339
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,320
I'm afraid that I will be teased

340
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,940
You don't have to worry about being tease

341
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,230
Because We...

342
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,230
Will definitely tease you

343
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,030
The 3rd method

344
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,200
This comes from Scotland

345
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,160
sneaking to bring things
that have the meaning of heart to him

346
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,380
and he must not know who gives the gifts

347
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,510
so the target will know that
there's somebody who interested in him

348
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,190
that's My jelly, be careful

349
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,330
How could you make it fall?

350
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,400
thank you very much teacher Pon

351
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,560
sated egg for you

352
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,130
Yes

353
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:04,160
It means that when you're traveling
you thought of me all the time

354
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,850
I will eat them till they're all gone

355
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,680
Thank you very much

356
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,680
thank

357
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,500
Teacher Pon's salted egg, Eh

358
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,050
Pon's egg, Salted teacher, Eh!!

359
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,050
Teacher Pon's salted egg, Eh!!

360
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,050
That right

361
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,890
Teacher Pon's gives me ka

362
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,940
Teacher's Pon's salted egg

363
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,430
You're not going to tell me that....

364
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,430
Yes, Teacher Pon bought these from the trip

365
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,450
How many of the boxes?

366
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,090
4 ka

367
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,510
4 boxes?

368
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,120
Damn it, Salted egg!!

369
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,930
Maybe, you cannot finish all of them, be careful then

370
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:03,770
We forgot one thing

371
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,410
our country is tropical

372
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,930
Mangoes?

373
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:14,560
Yes

374
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,900
Other people give flower or handkerchief
but you would give him mangoes?

375
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,770
How is it romantic?

376
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,530
Hey, Hey

377
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,530
That's him

378
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,500
Oh!! He's so handsome haha

379
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,500
Let's go, go, go

380
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,850
Mango cake ka

381
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,850
I did it myself

382
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:37,870
Thank you

383
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,550
It looks delicious

384
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:41,940
Are you ok?

385
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,670
I'm ok

386
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:45,320
It's The end

387
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,320
We totally lost

388
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,260
She only did a little

389
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,040
but it works

390
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,360
yes

391
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,790
She's cute

392
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,790
good future housewife

393
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,790
How can we compete with?

394
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,520
Change the one you love, then

395
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,020
Actually

396
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,110
I have another appointment

397
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,240
But teacher Pon invites me to your house for dinner

398
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,740
Importantly, It's the first time

399
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,390
Umm...................

400
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,110
If you are really not free, it's ok

401
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,410
We can meet next term

402
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,010
Ohhhh, wait wait ka

403
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,430
Actually, In is free Ka

404
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,910
I can go

405
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,540
Teacher Pon Ka

406
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,740
See you this evening

407
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,400
But, teacher Pon

408
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,790
This dinner is not for the two of us?

409
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,960
Oyy, please don't call it dinner

410
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,960
It's better to call it summer celebration party

411
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,410
Many teachers will come to the party

412
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,360
I guarantee it will be fun

413
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,360
Uhh, ok

414
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,450
Teacher Orn!!!

415
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,660
Teacher In....

416
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,780
I've never surrendered to whoever

417
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,000
This war..

418
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,180
is very important!!!

419
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,290
Teacher!! That's my answer sheet

420
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,060
Ouyy!

421
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,500
Higher, Higher

422
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,780
Teacher

423
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,780
Lift it more, more, Nam

424
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,690
I get an idea

425
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:24,060
P'Shone must ride Nam to home

426
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,360
Yes

427
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,660
Nam must have dreamed about it
for once in a lifetime

428
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,320
It is right?

429
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,050
When P'Shone ride Nam to home

430
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,700
When getting off the motorbike

431
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,460
When giving mangoes

432
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:40,730
So romantic

433
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,730
Eyyyyy!!!

434
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,130
Try to look like your motorbike is breaking down

435
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,610
How can it break?

436
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,480
When he try to start...

437
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,010
He will know it

438
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:53,750
Uh yes

439
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,750
How about losing the key?

440
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,710
How comes it will be missing?

441
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,820
It's here

442
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,730
Hey

443
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:03,800
It has lost

444
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:05,800
Hey

445
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,150
P' Shone

446
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,150
He's there

447
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,780
Oops

448
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:14,920
Oww, N' Mango cake

449
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,320
How is your leg?

450
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,850
I just stumbled on the ground maybe my leg is twist

451
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,850
Come on, I will ride for you

452
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,550
Never mind, I'm ok

453
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,780
Oops

454
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,740
Come on, you better come with me

455
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,000
How clumsy I am

456
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,010
Oh, This is so drama

457
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,740
Did she graduate from acting school?

458
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,740
Bye Bye M.1(Grade 7)
Good luck my friends

459
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,050
See you at M.2 class

460
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,110
Mom, Mom

461
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,730
Look at this mom

462
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,380
Pang, stop, Pang!!

463
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,040
Mommy, P'Nam has a boy friend

464
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:05,310
Nam

465
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,310
If that so, how can you go to see dad?

466
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,100
For this matter, I think you should grow up more before you can involve with it

467
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,560
For today

468
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,480
You should think about studying only

469
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,520
Owww

470
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,220
Cheer, you come here?

471
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:36,420
Pang called me that her sis is being heart-broken

472
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,420
Have been listening to music for a weak

473
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:42,050
I think you can forget about P'Shone

474
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,590
Ha Ha Ha

475
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,290
Lower the voice!

476
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,420
My mom will hear

477
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,350
Your mom's not home, she went to the market

478
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,270
Cheer, it's crowd

479
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:58,000
Nam, when will your mom broaden out the stairs?

480
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,350
Hey Nam, Let's look at another method?

481
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:03,580
Listen carefully

482
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,730
The 7th method

483
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,730
It's the Gypsy's method

484
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,120
The love must build up our self

485
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,870
Use the power of love to make us smarter

486
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,080
More beautiful

487
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,810
and be better in everything

488
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,030
He will look back at us finally

489
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,530
Ehh, What're you doing?

490
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,080
P'Shone is handsome

491
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,390
So Nam must be beautiful
Awww!!!

492
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:32,300
Umm, her skin is almost strip out

493
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,940
"Monday, I'm waiting"

494
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,940
"Tuesday, I'm still waiting to see"

495
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,610
"see..see...if you are fine"

496
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,630
"Wednesday, you're still not here"

497
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,630
"Neither in the morning, nor later"

498
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:49,160
"Thursday is also empty"

499
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,730
"Friday or Saturday or even Sunday"

500
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:56,520
"None of the day that I don't miss you"

501
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:01,240
"None of the day that you will come back"

502
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,640
"To be in our old days"

503
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:10,490
"How long it will be like this? I don't know"

504
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:14,500
"How many months or years?"

505
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,950
"How many billions of our past memory?"

506
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,900
-Eh what is it?

507
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,020
It's Kamin (wipe for brighter skin)

508
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,810
"I never don't miss you"

509
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:25,920
Heyyy

510
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,340
Hello, girls

511
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,860
Tell me if you want something

512
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,480
Take it easy

513
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,450
(Shock!! Pornchai made the team lose to the champion cup)

514
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,360
Nam

515
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,010
We cannot find

516
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:01,010
Maybe he's out

517
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,470
Maybe he's not home

518
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,010
I don't see his motorbike

519
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,120
Hey, girls

520
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,330
Have you found it?

521
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:08,760
Uhhh

522
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,190
found it

523
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,860
This

524
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,240
Aww, what do you come to buy?

525
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:27,620
You play table-tennis?

526
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,440
Why do you look yellow?

527
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,890
Do you have Jaundice?

528
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,870
P'Shone

529
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:44,130
Aww, N' Mango cake

530
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,030
What do you come to buy?

531
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,710
a dozen of table-tennis balls

532
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,460
Ok, follow me

533
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,370
Ayyyyyyy

534
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,420
Come over hear boys and girls

535
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,530
register to drama club with teacher In??

536
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,710
Drama club is here

537
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,250
We have many stories to play

538
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,680
you can be princess, prince

539
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,570
Hero, heroine, it's up to you my children

540
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,510
Mum, Teng, Nong used to be in my club

541
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,420
Come on ka

542
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,340
Are you interested?

543
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,850
Uh, Khun Panya Nirankun also used to be in our club

544
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:15,540
Is it true?

545
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,640
If you want to be famous, come to our club

546
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:17,730
Come on children

547
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:18,340
(Thai classical dance club)

548
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,330
It's the place to register, not walking pass

549
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,430
You should take of your glasses, Nam

550
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,570
I'm not used to..

551
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,360
I think

552
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,470
We are not suitable for this concept at all

553
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,040
White skin, Beautiful, Chinese-look alike

554
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,040
whatever quality of that classical dancers

555
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,870
Yes, it's true.

556
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:43,240
Every year, teacher Orn selects only
good and beautiful children

557
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,210
and when they're dancing
the whole school students come to see them

558
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,360
Umm, that's right

559
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,170
it's not like those drama club students

560
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,680
They are all ugly

561
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,380
Nobody wants to see them performing

562
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,610
Huyyy

563
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,610
but we should try it

564
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:58,180
The four of us may be

565
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,720
not white, not look Chinese

566
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,870
but beautiful, dark skin

567
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,240
pioneer generation

568
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,590
Heayyy, P'Shone

569
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,590
P'Shone

570
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,000
Which club do you want to register?

571
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,180
Photography

572
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:16,470
You can tell me, if you want a model for pictures

573
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:20,560
I like to take scenery pics, not people

574
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,010
Hey, are you kidding me?

575
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,630
Ok, I'm kidding then

576
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,330
Come on

577
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:29,700
I will take it

578
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,450
So, you already aren't yellow?

579
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,330
Do you get brighter?

580
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,300
May be a little..

581
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,230
I will wait for you guys

582
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:04,850
on the school festival day

583
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,250
You see? Nam

584
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,920
You got good feedback from P'Shone

585
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,590
that you're brighter
You have to be confident

586
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:25,550
If we can perform the dancing
We must be famous

587
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,180
Must be good and beautiful
Remember it

588
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:33,100
If not sure about the beautifulness
you can go to other clubs

589
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,780
Hey Faye, why did you speak like that?

590
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,230
No, I didn't
I spoke with Kwan

591
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,330
Did I? Kwan?

592
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,330
Liar

593
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,330
You criticize us!!

594
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,710
Hey, you must stop

595
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,980
The ones who make problems, Go out!

596
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,030
Wait

597
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,400
Faye and Kwan

598
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,500
Stay here

599
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,040
Nam

600
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,030
I'm sorry for that matter

601
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,170
I have to apologize you too.

602
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,890
I bought a surplus drink

603
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,400
You can take it
I give you

604
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,730
Wait!! Stop it

605
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,970
Let this girl drink first

606
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,300
Why don't you drink

607
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:52,570
You should leave

608
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,520
If you don't want to drink water with fish sauce

609
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,080
then, don't forget to pour it away

610
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,670
Look at that girl's behavior

611
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:11,130
You're here!!
I've been searching for long

612
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,530
Look at my face

613
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,930
Smile

614
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,220
be sullen

615
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,760
Laugh

616
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,490
It's perfect

617
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,390
See me at the auditorium tomorrow,then

618
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,290
OK

619
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,170
Teacher ka

620
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,170
Don't speak out loud

621
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,720
cause I offer limited students

622
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,280
Understand?

623
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,320
Teacher In

624
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:41,500
Teacher In

625
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,030
Ouyy, why do you stretch your mount like that?

626
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,170
Teacher In, Teacher In!! How are you?

627
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,790
You alright?

628

Teacher In, are you alright?

629
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,660
Teacher In

630
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,890
Do you need something? Head master

631
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,230
No, Nothing

632

Nooo!!

00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,750
It's suitable, I'm guarantee

641
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,880
Teacher

642
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,430
Oh, you come too late

643
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,910

652

00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,440
What are you doing here?

674
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,140
Paint color

675
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,650
Paint color 'inside' the box?

676
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,860
I bough interior painting color

677
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,280
Go paint other place

678
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,490
Wait Wait

679
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,470
You, go jot down tel number of all art students

680
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,760
Must not miss any

681
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,470
Teacher Pon ka

682
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,900
My students...

683
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,900
have a gift for acting

684
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,160
I'm guarantee that...

685
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,060
Uhh... Teacher In krab

686
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,060
Are you sick?

687
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,320
No....

688
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,050
I'm ok

689
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,280
Orhhhhhhhh

690
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:58,000
Teacher Pon may not used to my natural face

691
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,750
For the lipstick...

692
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,450
it's wasted to apply it

693
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:02,550
More importantly

694
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,490
I give an advantage to 'someone'

695
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,020
So

696
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,240
Teacher In give an advantage too much?

697
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,280
Oyyyy!!

698
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,930
better measure with work result

699
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,400
cause about the beautifulness
I think they are about the same

700
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,770
and now, I taught my students

701
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,360
wear make up in my style

702
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,140
When they grow up
they will be natural beautiful

703
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,230
And now!!!!

704
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,540
This is the natural beauty!!

705
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,540
suit their age

706
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,030
Are you sure that...

707
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,710
You've already taught them?

708
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,470
Is this stage drama or...

709
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,390
stage comedy Teacher In?

710
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:42,720
It may be Monkey drama then, Teacher Orn

711
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,360
This is children's creativity

712
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,070
(9 recipe of love book)

713
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:02,740
Aww, you're going home?

714
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,360

00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,480
Be careful

717
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,180
She walked normally when coming in

718
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:32,260
Why claudication when going back?

719
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,330
Teacher krab

720
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,010

728
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,210

729
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,210
clap the hands welcome her

730
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:18,390
I'm counting on you Pin

731
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,930
I think we should start

732
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:21,220

736
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,120

741
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:38,530
Snow white with dental braces

742
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:51,800

743
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,970
I don't want to wear dental braces anymore

744
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,510
Will get them out

745
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,480

746
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:03,420
OK, You're ready. Stand by Nam

747
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,280

Come on, rehearse instead of him

754

00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:22,030

00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:15,060
Beautiful girl

845
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,930
Hey girl!
What's your name?

846
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:18,520
It's you.. What's your name?

847
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,490
Hmm, embarrassed. You're shy

848
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:25,490
Oww, where're you going? going? Hey Hey

849
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,490
N' come to fight with me?

850
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:30,490
Maybe Teacher In projects it.

851
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,200
Already shown here all day?

852
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,480
Hey Hey Hey

853
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,650
That's N' Snow white that is in the TV

854
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:42,140
She's cute

855
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:43,780
Does she has boy friend?

856
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:45,780
Might not

857
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,490
but I think you shouldn't court her

858
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,490
Hey Why?

859
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,800
Is she too young?

860
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,170
I used to ask for Tel. number of grade 5 girl.

861
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:02,210
(End of M.2)
(Passing to M.3)

862
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:10,670
Shone krab

863
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:12,180
It's your turn krab

864
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,260
Again, every times that I play football...

865
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,080
You always give me to kick penalty

866
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,490
Kick it by yourself, then

867
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,350
You still don't recover from it?

868
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,160
Till now, your dad may have forgotten it

869
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,300
No, it's not that
it's because the kick is too easy

870
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,620
So I don't want to kick

871
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,380
Oh ho, Christiano Ronaldo

872
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:31,840
P' Top ka, Could we take pictures with you?

873
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:31,810
Krab

874
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,170
Me too?

875
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,520
So, who will take it for me?

876
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,160
You take picture for me first ok?

877
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,920
Uh.. I will take it for you two

878
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:38,590
No, I won't

879
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:40,590
Thank you ka

880
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,360
Stand close more

881
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:48,060
One... two

882
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,300
three

883
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:01,330
Oh, What!!

884
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:03,280
What!! Why you're doing like this?

885
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,280
You must apologize!

886
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:13,220
What's going on? STOP STOP

887
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,580
Stop

888
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:21,840
Hey, You could make something like this?

889
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:23,510
I don't know

890
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,220
I'm the referee, head master

891
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:43,170
How many days left for the region sport competition?

892
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:45,420
about 2 weeks ka

893
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:49,300
but athletes and cheer students have practiced so hard

894
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,300
Who will be the drum major, then?

895
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:55,750
Look like I have to consult with teacher Orn

896
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,750
Maybe she can help

897
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,400
Don't worry, head master

898
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,400
I will get it done

899
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,070
My mouth is hurt

900
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:31,030
Nam!!!

901
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:34,960
Since I was born till I am fully adult

902
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,520
I've never seen anyone who are perfect and excellent as much as you

903
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,520
You're good looking very much

904
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:46,050
Teacher In, you should speak straightly

905
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:48,190
Do you have something?

906
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,310
Umm......I....

907
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:55,390
I want you to be a drum major for our school
In the region sport day

908
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:56,270
Ha!!!

909
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:58,630
Don't need to Ha!! anymore
It's you

910
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:00,330
You're the most suitable girl

911
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:03,630
but, it's only 2 weeks

912
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:05,630
I don't think I could do

913
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:10,850
but I don't see anyone who could help
Except you, Nam

914
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:14,690
Ok, I promise

915
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:16,090
I will become a nun for your favor

916
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,570
Become a nun?

917
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,060
How about two years?

918
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,160
or all of my life?

919
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:25,920
I can do it, Nam

920
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,030
be perpendicular

921
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:37,400
Look up

922
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,220
Throw

923
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:40,420
Just after throwing, look at the spear

924
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,960
After that, when it's near ourselves

925
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,280
Grab it

926
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,120
Then continue to walk

927
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,190
Is it difficult?

928
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:48,190
It's not hard at all

929
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:50,520
Can you try?

930
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,670
I've already had my spear

931
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:55,060
You just have to do it, that's yours
This is mine

932
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:57,500
Ready? Aim at the target

933
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,500
If you're ready, throw!!!

934
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,240
One Two Three, Throw!

935
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:15,480
It's hard

936
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,480
Why doesn't she find other girls?

937
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:21,250
Hey, don't get discouraged

938
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:23,250
These are only a few days

939
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:26,600
Here, this method is important

940
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:29,240
In the 9 recipe of love book

941
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,240
The last method was written that..

942
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:34,900
If you want to do because of love
Do it all-out with your heart

943
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:38,110
Your beloved will come to you finally

944
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,890
Heayy, Nam

945
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:48,490
You've come this far
Fight with all your might

946
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:51,370
It's not only for school drum major

947
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:53,490
You will be the leading drum major for our province

948
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:55,490
Fight

949
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,850
"Far.. Far away"

950
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:19,870
"Too far left... Too far"

951
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,770
Top, pass to me
Top!

952
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:33,750
"Far...Too far"

953
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:34,150
Hey

954
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,700
Again, you glance at  girls again

955
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:38,680
Head master

956
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:43,930
I can guarantee that our marching band will be the most remarkable

957
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:45,250
How about drum major?

958
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:49,390
Oh don't worry at all
Beautiful, Tall, White skin

959
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:51,620
Overall, she's wonderful

960
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,980
Teachers, Be careful!!

961
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:06,970
I'm sorry

962
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:12,210
Don't tell me she is our leading drum major

963
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:15,720
Yes but she has been doing well in all the past-time

964
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,310
Today, it may be her first failure

965
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:20,310
Throwing like a boomerang like this?

966
01:00:20,310 --> 01:00:21,630
If she also fail in the real day, what're we going to do?

967
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:23,930
It may not happen

968
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:34,810
replace her

969
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:36,810
or else I will replace you!

970
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:41,210
but we only have 1 week left, head master

971
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:44,640
I am in trouble

972
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:50,840
The head master get hold of the spear?

973
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,100
Who will be the school drum major?

974
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:55,900
I don't know, serve Teacher In right

975
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:58,640
She didn't select beautiful and skillful like us

976
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,340
She insisted on that whoever girl

977
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:04,220
Each of Her students are so terrible

978
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:07,790
It's good we're not her students
If so, we would have low profile

979
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,190
How can you speak like this?

980
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,700
Because It's true

981
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:14,980
Bug face

982
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:24,540
I will make those girls see that
Teacher In students are not terrible

983
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:29,180
Use Broom?

984
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:32,140
Where did you get it from?

985
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:34,140
I borrowed from the janitor

986
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:37,440
Even though it's light, it's ok to use

987
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:46,560
I won't let anyone look down on us and Teacher In

988
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:57,350
Everyone

989
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:58,780
Today

990
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:00,780
Play at the utmost of your strength

991
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:08,360
That That

992
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:31,290
Will you do it?

993
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,460
My son is going to kick the penalty goal?

994
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,460
Let's get back

995
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,360
Wait Wait!

996
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:42,350
What a surprise, he's going to kick the penalty?

997
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:45,130
Uh, Am I deceptive?

998
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:01,440
It's ok
It's ok

999
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,440
Do you know?

1000
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:07,530
It's because of his dad, our province couldn't get the national trophy

1001
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:18,930
Hey, I will let you kick the penalty again
The previous kick was just a warm up

1002
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:21,890
Your aunt's house set this rule?

1003
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:24,060
Yes, it's from my aunt's house

1004
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:26,060
My uncle's house also has this rule

1005
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:27,660
My house too

1006
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:29,830
More importantly, I haven't blown the whistle

1007
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:41,140
He'll kick again

1008
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,380
You can play as a forward player for our school now

1009
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:26,690
Yes

1010
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:33,780
Shone is good!
Shone is good

1011
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:39,900
Hmm, sweet smile huh?

1012
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:42,890
I understand

1013
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:02,140
"Far It's too far"

1014
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:05,880
"Far It's too far"

1015
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:20,380
"Even though, It's too far from here"

1016
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:23,970
"I will reach there"

1017
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:29,300
It's perfect, my daughter

1018
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,740
Aha, OMG

1019
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:34,460
Umm, excuse me Teacher Orn

1020
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:38,610
I'd like to know that Did your dancers
use to throw headdress and catch it like her?

1021
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:42,510
Higher Higher

1022
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:44,510
Great

1023
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:25,840
How's your sister?
Is she beautiful like the mom?

1024
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,840
Alas! She's more beautiful than mom

1025
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:32,650
Very beautiful, Nam

1026
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,430
I don't want to move anywhere

1027
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:44,840
I see you speak like this every time

1028
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:01,450
Nam, your beautifulness is too much huh?

1029
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:05,020
On the last year Valentine, She still had dark face
haha

1030
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:08,070
It's from P'Kai, It will be mine

1031
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:09,850
Did Nam give you?

1032
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:10,680
I don't know

1033
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,720
Nam, I'll take this pink chocolate?

1034
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:16,440
Yes

1035
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,700
How is Nam?
She looks lonely

1036
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:23,800
She's waiting for the only one
And he haven't come

1037
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:26,900
Nam, Come on

1038
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,390
Hurry

1039
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:36,400
Go on

1040
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:47,060
Here

1041
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:56,720
It's from a friend of mine

1042
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,210
Nam

1043
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:52,770
See you tomorrow 4PM

1044
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:55,040
In front of 3rd floor stairs

1045
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,630
I have something to tell you

1046
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:25,000
Hey Shone
Going home with us?

1047
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:26,920
I'll go afterward

1048
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:40,570
Nam

1049
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:45,700
I'm certain that you would come

1050
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:52,080
Is this letter from P'Top?

1051
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:56,190
Yes, That's mine

1052
01:09:57,790 --> 01:10:00,200
Do you have something to tell?

1053
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:06,110
Will you be my girl friend?

1054
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:11,600
Uh, Did P'Shone has something to talk with me?

1055
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:15,090
Orhh I just wanted to ask..

1056
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:16,790
Why did you come up here

1057
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:20,770
Now, I know the reason

1058
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,450
What is the answer?

1059
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:34,720
If you don't answer
I will think you're ok with it?

1060
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:38,450
Ha!! P'Top?

1061
01:10:38,450 --> 01:10:40,450
How come?

1062
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:43,230
P'Shone only spoke like that?

1063
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:44,820
Yes

1064
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:47,650
How about you, Nam?
What did you tell him?

1065
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:49,650
I didn't answer

1066
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:53,530
What am I going to do now, Cheer?

1067
01:10:53,530 --> 01:10:56,110
You should wait and see

1068
01:10:56,110 --> 01:11:00,470
P'Top is P'Shone best friend
If you do something without considering

1069
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:02,470
P'Shone will surely be angry at you

1070
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,910
Are you free today?
Let's go to see football match

1071
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:13,460
Uh I'm not free today

1072
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:18,650
It's not long
Shone will play as a real player for the first time

1073
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,440
I can go

1074
01:11:28,210 --> 01:11:29,660
Nam

1075
01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:41,470
Water
- Thank you

1076
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:44,270
Hey, do you have some drink?

1077
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:45,810
No, I don't

1078
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:57,450
Plan B

1079
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:02,120
Run more

1080
01:12:30,150 --> 01:12:31,550
You know it, mr button?

1081
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:33,800
I want to sit behind P'Shone on his motorbike

1082
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:42,510
(The first semester has end)
(See you M.3)

1083
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:48,500
Cheer, which cake do you like to eat in your birthday?
Choose it by yourself

1084
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:51,680
Vanilla cake

1085
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:54,210
Nam likes it

1086
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:02,090
Hello, Nam?

1087
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:03,760
Where are you?

1088
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:06,290
We're choosing birthday cake for Cheer

1089
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:08,840
I come to a dam with P'Shone and friends

1090
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,430
I can't go on time

1091
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:13,340
I called Cheer this morning but no one hung up

1092
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:15,650
Happy birthday to Cheer for me then

1093
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:17,460
Yes, I'm sorry

1094
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:19,460
Ok Ok
I will tell Cheer

1095
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:24,030
P' Ka, This piece ka

1096
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:41,020
Squid

1097
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,050
I'll be back

1098
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:15,680
What are you doing here?

1099
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:21,910
Uh, I think this area is beautiful

1100
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,780
Do you want to eat Squid?

1101
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:35,770
Have you heard of the squid's story?

1102
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:38,440
No

1103
01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:42,860
I will tell you

1104
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:47,910
Once upon a time

1105
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:50,110
There were two squids

1106
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,240
They had traveled till they met each other

1107
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,350
Then, they fell in love

1108
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:59,470
They became a couple

1109
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:02,300
Finally

1110
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:04,300
They got married

1111
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:08,070
On the day of marriage

1112
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:13,720
Squid priest told them to hold hands

1113
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:15,890
So, they held each other hands

1114
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:19,160
held the hands

1115
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:20,940
held hands

1116
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,510
held hands

1117
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:24,870
held hands, held hands

1118
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:30,660
Ha, P'Shone

1119
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:32,010
Crazy

1120
01:15:34,290 --> 01:15:35,630
But cute

1121
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:37,390
The teller or the squids?

1122
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:38,320
The teller

1123
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,320
Eh the squids

1124
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,910
Umm, I'm confused

1125
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:45,660
I kinda don't want to eat them

1126
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:50,410
I've never eaten squids for so long
Since I heard this story

1127
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:56,910
So...

1128
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:00,510
Did you use to hold someone hand like the squids?

1129
01:16:02,210 --> 01:16:03,700
Once

1130
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,390
An awkward-face girl

1131
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:08,910
was falling down from the stage

1132
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,110
So, I held her hand

1133
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:12,350
Nam!

1134
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:17,010
Why don't you eat squids?

1135
01:16:17,010 --> 01:16:19,290
I prepared it myself, it looks delicious

1136
01:16:19,290 --> 01:16:20,750
No!!

1137
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:20,560
No!!

1138
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:24,590
Why? It's delicious

1139
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:26,840
I'm asking you straightly

1140
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,840
Do you like Nam

1141
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:31,950
Uh, You be with her
Why asking me?

1142
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:35,900
It's noting
kidding nah

1143
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:42,330
Are you alright?

1144
01:16:42,330 --> 01:16:44,640
I'm Ok, just a little hurt

1145
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:45,930
Let's stand up

1146
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:49,610
Come on, ride piggyback me

1147
01:16:58,780 --> 01:16:59,990
Mr Button

1148
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:02,430
Today, P'Shone carries the bag for me

1149
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:16,650
Nam??

1150
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:20,360
Cheer's not home
went with Gie and Nim

1151
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:22,560
Nam didn't go with them?

1152
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:24,480
No ka

1153
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,480
Try to call them

1154
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:41,560
I miss the old days

1155
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:45,180
When we're doing home work altogether

1156
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:48,260
An angel must be in heaven

1157
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:50,450
Who want to be in hell like us

1158
01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:52,730
Cheer calm down

1159
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:55,040
we still have birth day again in the next year

1160
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:58,470
Nim, I only have 3 friends

1161
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:00,750
If I were her, I wouldn't do like this

1162
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:13,130
Cheer, will you come to do home work at my house?

1163
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:14,860
Why don't you ask P'Shone and friends?

1164
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:39,520
Top has not come yet?

1165
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:45,950
He appoint me to teach a M.3 student

1166
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:47,730
He hasn't come

1167
01:18:47,730 --> 01:18:50,010
He go to borrow books to do project work

1168
01:18:50,010 --> 01:18:52,010
for a M.3 student

1169
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:57,560
that day

1170
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,560
My mom stayed in the hospital

1171
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:05,060
Which day?

1172
01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:08,520
The day that my dad missed the penalty kick

1173
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:11,430
I was born that day

1174
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,150
So, my dad gave a birth day gift to me

1175
01:19:16,150 --> 01:19:19,530
by quitting playing football  his entire life

1176
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,540
I'm the one who brings bad luck

1177
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:26,260
Look at it

1178
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:29,220
The province had never come that far till that day

1179
01:19:32,110 --> 01:19:33,940
Are you ok?

1180
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,910
For me being teased?

1181
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:38,910
I'm ok

1182
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:40,910
I'm used to it

1183
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:44,350
It becomes my surname

1184
01:19:44,350 --> 01:19:45,940
Shone

1185
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:48,800
whose dad couldn't score penalty kick

1186
01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:51,270
But it's ok

1187
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:53,440
I am a football player

1188
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:57,700
Do you want to become a footballer?

1189
01:19:58,470 --> 01:20:00,220
I don't know

1190
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:03,380
For now

1191
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,380
I need somebody

1192
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:13,840
Nam

1193
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:16,860
I couldn't find the books

1194
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:18,860
Help me find?

1195
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:28,280
Wait a bit, Shone

1196
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:40,700
Love you but you don't know
Only conceal it withing my heart

1197
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:46,740
P'Shone, I've heard that there will be a surprise for P' Ake birthday

1198
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:49,540
Let's wait and see

1199
01:20:50,690 --> 01:20:55,360
Want us to be together

1200
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,650
Love you but you don't know

1201
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:03,070
Love you, only if you know

1202
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:10,160
Love you but you don't know

1203
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:17,760
It's the time for our special show tonight

1204
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:23,890
It happened when we studied grade 5

1205
01:21:23,890 --> 01:21:26,390
That time, both of us

1206
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:28,030
secretly loved the same girl

1207
01:21:28,030 --> 01:21:30,370
Her name is Boe, a grade 4

1208
01:21:30,370 --> 01:21:32,700
We tried to compete each other by practicing dancing

1209
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:36,330
So one of us could dance with her in the school party

1210
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:38,280
But when the real day came

1211
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:43,990
Our P'Shone had chickenpox

1212
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:48,570
So the right to dance with her was mine

1213
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,740
But finally...

1214
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:52,740
Khun Top gave up his right

1215
01:21:53,190 --> 01:21:54,830
So, we both failed

1216
01:21:54,830 --> 01:21:58,950
Aww, That's because our P'Shone
Intimidated that he would break up with me

1217
01:21:59,890 --> 01:22:02,820
After that, we promised each other...

1218
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:04,910
We will not like the same girl

1219
01:22:04,910 --> 01:22:06,610
That's right

1220
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:08,120
Come on

1221
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:09,940
Islander's dance

1222
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:42,910
Happy birthday to you

1223
01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:02,770
Nam, tomorrow I will come here the same time

1224
01:23:02,770 --> 01:23:04,770
Let's watch P'Shone play football

1225
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:08,390
P'Top doesn't need to pick me up anymore

1226
01:23:09,490 --> 01:23:11,580
Why? You will not be free?

1227
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:14,980
No, I mean that....

1228
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:18,470
Don't involve with me anymore

1229
01:23:21,190 --> 01:23:24,400
You're angry at me that I kissed your cheek?

1230
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,640
But you're my girl friend?

1231
01:23:28,710 --> 01:23:30,060
P' Top ka

1232
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:32,750
I've never accepted that I'm your girl friend

1233
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:35,740
So, what's the meaning of all these time

1234
01:23:36,650 --> 01:23:38,210
I'm sorry

1235
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:42,720
I have the one I love

1236
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,970
Who?

1237
01:23:46,810 --> 01:23:48,460
Nam, who is he?

1238
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:50,460
Nam

1239
01:23:56,390 --> 01:23:58,730
Since I've been with girls

1240
01:23:59,490 --> 01:24:01,580
She is the most painful

1241
01:24:03,610 --> 01:24:06,000
I beg you one thing, Shone

1242
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:10,720
No matter what

1243
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:13,660
you won't hit on Nam?

1244
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:17,370
Do you think that the reason she broke up with you is me?

1245
01:24:17,370 --> 01:24:19,370
No

1246
01:24:19,370 --> 01:24:21,370
It's just unbearable

1247
01:24:21,370 --> 01:24:23,790
That my best friend

1248
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:26,710
be with the girl I love

1249
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:30,030
You said like this

1250
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:32,030
I cannot deny

1251
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:35,250
Are you ok with it?

1252
01:24:35,990 --> 01:24:37,250
Yes

1253
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:05,720
"I don't understand"

1254
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,060
Thank you mom

1255
01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:09,840
"Why it must be you.."

1256
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,670
"To be the one in my heart"

1257
01:25:12,670 --> 01:25:17,200
"I have met many people"

1258
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:21,700
"But It must be you eventually"

1259
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:24,400
"Who are in my heart"

1260
01:25:25,270 --> 01:25:26,400
"Love"

1261
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:31,230
"Is not a coincidence"

1262
01:25:31,290 --> 01:25:32,580
"Love"

1263
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:37,220
"Can connect you with me"

1264
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:39,720
"There's only the heart that knows"

1265
01:25:39,770 --> 01:25:42,790
"Who is the one in my dream"

1266
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:47,650
"You're the one that I've been waiting"

1267
01:25:47,790 --> 01:25:51,500
"Because the heart is begging"

1268
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:54,460
"Cause the heart is calling for"

1269
01:25:54,460 --> 01:26:00,040
"Born to be your forever"

1270
01:26:00,150 --> 01:26:03,000
"It's because my heart"

1271
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,940
"Never confused"

1272
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:11,270
"It's certain that you are the only one"

1273
01:26:13,130 --> 01:26:17,770
"There are not many reasons"

1274
01:26:17,770 --> 01:26:22,850
"It just because my heart chooses you"

1275
01:26:32,350 --> 01:26:35,870
Hey, I've called my friend who is the manager of Bangkok glass team

1276
01:26:35,870 --> 01:26:37,160
and?

1277
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:38,810
He told me that

1278
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:42,600
He would accept you to practice in Bangkok Glass club

1279
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:44,900
You cheated me to lose the ball?

1280
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:48,200
For this important matter, who are willing to lie

1281
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,200
You should prepare yourself

1282
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:53,030
Maybe after you have finished this year's exam

1283
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:55,800
You might have to go study in Bangkok

1284
01:26:57,310 --> 01:26:58,630
Dad!!

1285
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:00,630
Thank you krab

1286
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:18,290
Teacher Pon should tell me sooner

1287
01:27:18,290 --> 01:27:22,300
so I could get a scholarship to go with you

1288
01:27:22,910 --> 01:27:24,470
I'm sorry

1289
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:28,120
I was busy so I didn't tell you

1290
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:34,550
but there will be a new sport teacher

1291
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:36,830
Oh! At this point of time

1292
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:40,510
No one can replace you
I confirm

1293
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:42,900
Before you go

1294
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:45,610
I beg you one thing

1295
01:27:45,610 --> 01:27:47,610
What is it?

1296
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:49,950
This

1297
01:27:52,150 --> 01:27:53,850
It's shame

1298
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:02,280
Uh, I asked for the heart
But he gives a whistle

1299
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:06,320
Umm, there he is

1300
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,570
The new sport teacher

1301
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:15,410
Aho!!!!

1302
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:18,070
Um I think Teacher Pon.....

1303
01:28:18,070 --> 01:28:20,270
should go now
You may miss the flight

1304
01:28:20,270 --> 01:28:23,640
Uh, I'm feeling that I'm busy right now

1305
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:25,020
Hurry up

1306
01:28:33,310 --> 01:28:38,110
Oh Teacher Orn!!
Come fast, Claim fast?

1307
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:40,590
Sawadde ka
-Sawadde krab

1308
01:28:40,590 --> 01:28:42,590
Are you the new teacher?
-Yes

1309
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:44,680
What's your name?
- Boat krab

1310
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:47,070
I want to ride a boat

1311
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:50,390
(Bye Bye M.3)
(See you M.4)

1312
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:57,550
Cheer, why don't you continue to study M.4 here?

1313
01:28:57,550 --> 01:28:59,860
cause the vocational school that I admitted

1314
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:02,300
Has pink uniform

1315
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:03,790
Crazy

1316
01:29:03,790 --> 01:29:07,330
It's cute
The whole school is pink, very sweet huh?

1317
01:29:33,830 --> 01:29:36,830
Monday, I'm waiting

1318
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:39,790
Tuesday, I'm still waiting to see

1319
01:29:39,790 --> 01:29:44,050
see..see...if you are fine

1320
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:48,190
Wednesday, you're still not here

1321
01:29:48,190 --> 01:29:50,910
Neither in the morning, nor later

1322
01:29:50,910 --> 01:29:54,100
Thursday is also emply

1323
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:58,790
Friday, Saturday or Sunday

1324
01:29:58,790 --> 01:30:03,430
None of the day that I don't miss you

1325
01:30:03,430 --> 01:30:09,030
None of the day that you will come back

1326
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:13,020
to be in our old days

1327
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,830
The day that I met you

1328
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:19,410
The day that I was close to you

1329
01:30:19,470 --> 01:30:23,260
The day that we held hands

1330
01:30:24,050 --> 01:30:27,680
The day that I loved you

1331
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:30,040
The day that I spoke to you

1332
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:33,390
The day that you listened to me

1333
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:38,280
How long it will be like this? I don't know

1334
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:42,260
How many months or years?

1335
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:47,420
How many billions of our past memory?

1336
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:50,960
I never don't miss you

1337
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:53,520

Why you're crying?

1340
01:30:59,590 --> 01:31:02,580
Singing a song like this
As if we are acting in a soap opera

1341
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:04,990
Yes, why we are crying?

"None of the day that I don't miss you"

1346
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:21,610
"None of the day that you will come back"

1347
01:31:21,610 --> 01:31:25,530
"To be in our old days"

1348
01:31:28,090 --> 01:31:29,290
Nam!

1369
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:31,460

You bargain too much
Hand it back,then

1377

Pang's boy friend?

1380
01:33:04,410 --> 01:33:06,940
No, he's Bam's boy friend

1381
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:09,380

I'm a tom boy

1385
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:29,280
Pang is hungry

1386
01:33:30,410 --> 01:33:32,580
Wait a bit, my daughter

1387
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:36,510
I know that

1388

Don't be precocious too much

1389
01:33:38,510 --> 01:33:40,300
How about you?

1390

You're so endurable
Secretly in love with him since M.1 till now

I think, you don't have to tell him

1395
01:34:03,230 --> 01:34:05,310
The world will record that...

1396
01:34:05,310 --> 01:34:09,430
There is a crazy girl trying to be beautiful
for a boy for 3 years

Nam! From now on, you may not see him again in all of your life

1399
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:22,120
Won't you do anything?

01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:25,410
(You've been better, Fight! Nam)

1503
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:27,580
"Every time we meet"

1504
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:30,160
"Every time you turn to me"

1505
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:32,580
"That I pretend to be still"

1506
01:42:32,550 --> 01:42:37,410
"Do you know how much I have to force myself"

1507
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:39,960
"Can you hear that?"

1508
01:42:38,540 --> 01:42:41,860
(Love can win everything especially fear)

1509
01:42:40,130 --> 01:42:42,130
"My heart....."

1510
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:45,950
"Is telling you I love you"

1511
01:42:42,190 --> 01:42:45,790
(The first day)
(It was very difficult to grow)
(One worm)

1512
01:42:45,070 --> 01:42:47,080
It's from a friend of mine

1513
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:52,930
"But I cannot reveal my true feeling to anyone"

1514
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:56,960
"Can you hear that my heart.."

1515
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:59,380
(Today, I gave the rose to Nam)
(I said it was from my friend)
(It's because I am tight-lipped)

1516
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:04,290
"Is waiting there for you to open"

1517
01:43:04,290 --> 01:43:07,180
"Can only hope you will know it"

1518
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:13,270
"Some day"

1519
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:15,390
(Today, I saw Top confessed...)
(You know I'm hurt)
(Why our time never match?)

1520
01:43:24,910 --> 01:43:28,290
(Me too, wanted you to ride on my back)

1521
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:38,260
Nam

1522
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:41,330
Will you be my girl friend?

1523
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:43,810
"Can you hear that..?"

1524
01:43:43,810 --> 01:43:45,400
"my heart..."

1525
01:43:46,030 --> 01:43:48,940
"is telling you I love you"

1526
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:56,380
"But I cannot reveal my true feeling to anyone"

1527
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:58,380
"Can you hear that....?"

1528
01:43:58,380 --> 01:44:00,380
"My heart..."

1529
01:44:00,690 --> 01:44:10,140
"Is still waiting there for you to open"

1530
01:44:31,610 --> 01:44:33,370
I beg you one thing Shone

1531
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,220
You won't hit on Nam?

1532
01:44:38,580 --> 01:44:41,770
"Can only hope you will know it"

1533
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:45,670
"That I'm the one here to love you"

1534
01:44:45,670 --> 01:44:52,810
"I'm begging you please know it"

1535
01:44:52,810 --> 01:44:57,090
"Some day"

1536
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:42,320
9 years later

1537
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:52,340
This side has windows

1538
01:45:56,810 --> 01:45:59,340
Kai, take care of the customers for me?

1539
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:00,790
A moment

1540
01:46:07,740 --> 01:46:10,160
Hi, handsome boy

1541
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:15,680
Do you feel asleep?

1542
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:18,200
I'm sorry to bother your time, Shone

1543
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:19,410
Never mind

1544
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:21,410
Your son is like my son

1545
01:46:25,450 --> 01:46:27,400
You're a cry baby again

1546
01:46:27,870 --> 01:46:29,080
My hair is messing

1547
01:46:30,230 --> 01:46:31,470
Pin I have to go now

1548
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:35,120
See you boy

1549
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:39,590
If only his real father would love him like you do

1550
01:46:39,590 --> 01:46:40,690
Speak like this again

1551
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:43,470
Call me later?

1552
01:46:44,010 --> 01:46:45,940
Shone

1553
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:48,900
How about the TV show that called you?

1554
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:50,190
Will you go?

1555
01:46:52,030 --> 01:46:54,120
I don't know

1556
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:57,830
Bye Bye Shone

1557
01:46:58,020 --> 01:47:00,740
Bye Bye, you yawn

1558
01:47:03,450 --> 01:47:05,490
Hurry up

1559
01:47:05,870 --> 01:47:09,470
Continue to Break 2, are you ready?
-A min

1560
01:47:09,470 --> 01:47:10,370
Ok

1561
01:47:10,370 --> 01:47:14,470
Clothing staffs ready?
- Yes

1562
01:47:14,470 --> 01:47:17,400
No worry, It will be perfect

1563
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:22,650
I'm ready

1564
01:47:22,650 --> 01:47:28,110
Please be relax
our show isn't formal

1565
01:47:28,110 --> 01:47:28,610
Yes

1566
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:32,260
You're beautiful
-Thank you ka

1567
01:47:36,730 --> 01:47:39,540
It's good that P' Nam is fashionable

1568
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:42,890
If P'Nam is beautiful as mom like me....

1569
01:47:44,530 --> 01:47:45,820
Dare to speak

1570
01:47:49,690 --> 01:47:51,040
Teacher Boat

1571
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:53,070
Sawaddee krab

1572
01:47:53,070 --> 01:47:56,750
Since then, I've rode this boat all the time

1573
01:47:57,880 --> 01:47:59,610
I'm jealous

1574
01:47:59,610 --> 01:48:02,270
He likes to do sweet things

1575
01:48:05,790 --> 01:48:07,430
I'm jealous

1576
01:48:12,380 --> 01:48:15,070
He always surprises me

1577
01:48:19,130 --> 01:48:21,740
Surprise again

1578
01:48:28,300 --> 01:48:31,680
Uh.. That.. That is a rose

1579
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:34,700
I have to eat, if not he will sulk

1580
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:38,270
5..4..3..2..

1581
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,140
Now, we're here with Khun Nam

1582
01:48:47,140 --> 01:48:50,930
The designer of the beautiful clothes that we've just watched

1583
01:48:51,340 --> 01:48:52,740
Sawaddee ka

1584
01:48:52,740 --> 01:49:02,620
Our fans may know her well
cause she is the designer in only a few of Thais that are famous in New York

1585
01:49:02,620 --> 01:49:04,620
and this is the evidence

1586
01:49:21,190 --> 01:49:24,070
This is only a part of her work

1587
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:29,510
Khun Nam, do you know that...

1588
01:49:29,510 --> 01:49:33,870
In Thailand, you're also well-known

1589
01:49:33,870 --> 01:49:38,240
I still have to develop my skill

1590
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:42,930
So, what work will you do as you came back to Thailand?

1591
01:49:42,990 --> 01:49:47,930
There's a brand that would like to organize a fashion show

1592
01:49:48,150 --> 01:49:53,260
I think it's interesting, so I agree to do

1593
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:56,800
and because I want to come back

1594
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:58,970
I miss my mom

1595
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:02,370
Khun Nam used to tell reporters that....

1596
01:50:02,650 --> 01:50:05,170
When you were young
Umm... I'm sorry

1597
01:50:05,170 --> 01:50:08,940
You were so ugly (bug face) and had bad sense of fashion

1598
01:50:08,940 --> 01:50:11,410
That's totally different from now

1599
01:50:11,410 --> 01:50:16,240
What make you've changed yourself this much?

1600
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:19,970
Because, I fell in love some one

1601
01:50:19,970 --> 01:50:21,970
falling in love?

1602
01:50:21,970 --> 01:50:25,050
Could you tell the story?

1603
01:50:25,050 --> 01:50:28,840
Yes, He was my senior

1604
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:30,960
M.4 senior

1605
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:32,470
He was a football player

1606
01:50:32,470 --> 01:50:35,380
and very cute

1607
01:50:35,380 --> 01:50:37,790
At that time, I.........

1608
01:50:37,790 --> 01:50:40,240
Had bug face studying M.1

1609
01:50:41,140 --> 01:50:42,630
Developed myself a lot

1610
01:50:42,630 --> 01:50:47,460
If It could make me to be beautiful, to be better
I tried to do it

1611
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:51,770
and tried to study better so he might interest in me

1612
01:50:51,770 --> 01:50:56,820
Did he know it, in the end?

1613
01:50:56,820 --> 01:51:00,260
He knew but it didn't have a happy ending

1614
01:51:00,260 --> 01:51:06,320
I went to study in the US

1615
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,600
to stay with my dad

1616
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:11,540
It's bad

1617
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:15,710
but when I think about it
He is like....

1618
01:51:15,710 --> 01:51:17,710
my inspiration

1619
01:51:17,710 --> 01:51:21,230
He made me use the love in good way

1620
01:51:21,230 --> 01:51:22,960
He is like....

1621
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:26,420
The power that support me to be better and better

1622
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:28,950
Till I am today's Nam

1623
01:51:28,950 --> 01:51:35,020
Khun Nam, you remember this notebook?

1624
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:42,160
You may recall it?

1625
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:44,820
Yes, I remember

1626
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:50,720
If so, let's welcome the owner of this book

1627
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:56,110
Khun Shone, the former footballer of Bangkok glass

1628
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:12,880
Now, he's changed his career to be a pro-photographer

1629
01:52:15,490 --> 01:52:17,280
I want to give it to Nam krab

1630
01:52:19,250 --> 01:52:20,930
Nam???

1631
01:52:20,930 --> 01:52:22,930
It's Nam's

1632
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:38,800
Please sit

1633
01:52:43,110 --> 01:52:48,000
Khun Shone, after you've never met Khun Nam for 9 years.....

1634
01:52:48,030 --> 01:52:51,630
Do you have something to tell Khun Nam?

1635
01:52:51,630 --> 01:52:56,460
I want to tell you that......

1636
01:53:02,420 --> 01:53:04,610
This button

1637
01:53:04,610 --> 01:53:06,610
is not mine

1638
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:09,910
It may be Ding's

1639
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:25,150
How about you Khun Nam?
Do you have something to tell him?

1640
01:53:29,570 --> 01:53:34,490
I want to ask P' Shone that......

1641
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:38,960
Have you been married?

1642
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:45,170
Umm.........

1643
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:51,130
Um...I have

1644
01:54:04,450 --> 01:54:07,600
I have been waiting for some one to come back from the US

1645
01:54:08,350 --> 01:54:09,860
"Can you hear that?"

1646
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:11,860
"My heart.."

1647
01:54:11,860 --> 01:54:15,150
"Is telling you I love you"

1648
01:54:15,150 --> 01:54:22,130
"But I cannot reveal my true feeling to anyone"

1649
01:54:22,930 --> 01:54:24,820
"Can you hear that?"

1650
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:26,390
"My heart......"

1651
01:54:26,390 --> 01:54:33,630
"Is still waiting there for you to open"

1652
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:40,470
"And I can only hope you will know it"

1653
01:54:41,240 --> 01:54:44,750
"That I'm the one here to love you"

1654
01:54:44,750 --> 01:54:50,930
"I'm begging you please know it"

1655
01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:55,490
"Some day"
