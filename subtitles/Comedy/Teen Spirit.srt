<i>Behold.</i>

3
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:41,542
<i>Before you are the most
popular students</i>

4
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,544
<i>At ashley high school.</i>

5
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,463
<i>In a world governed by
the laws of teenage physics,</i>

6
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:49,216
<i>These girls are
the gravitational force</i>

7
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:52,177
<i>All else revolves-
around which</i>

8
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,346
<i>Royalty, if you will.</i>

9
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:58,183
<i>With an iron fashion sense.
And they rule their kingdom</i>

10
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,352
<i>But if you think the royal
treatment is all they seek,</i>

11
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,187
<i>Don't be fooled.</i>

12
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,190
<i>A queen isn't really a queen
until she gets...</i>

13
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,483
Her crown.

14
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,527
<i>It's prom. Prom.</i>

15
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,154
You need a date, or
it's a reflection on me.

16
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,198
Not just anybody.
A-list. A-list.

17
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,325
Two varsity letters are better. Two.

18
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,369
Okay, okay.

19
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,330
A-list, two letters.
Got it.

20
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,165
Good.

21
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,139
<i>And these poor dears</i>

22
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,600
<i>Are ashley high school's
least popular students.</i>

23
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,602
<i>Isolated from
the mainstream,</i>

24
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,271
<i>Our outcasts retreat
each afternoon</i>

25
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,231
<i>To a dank garage,</i>

26
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,233
<i>Making little piggy movies</i>

27
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,568
<i>That other outcasts
will watch</i>

28
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,486
<i>From their own dreary rooms.</i>

29
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,155
The pig still
looks tense.

30
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:54,406
It can't be tense
for this shot.

31
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,202
Relax, pig.

32
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,126
Clear.

33
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,174
Cut, cut, cut,.

34
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,467
I'm not feeling
the drama.

35
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:16,220
We gotta go bigger,
much bigger.

36
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:22,351
<i>Rarely do these two groups</i>

37
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,353
<i>And that's really
for the best.</i>

38
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,563
I don't want any ninth- or
tenth-grade votes screwing this up.

39
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,315
Absolutely.
We'll round them up.

40
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,525
Round them up.

41
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,276
You're going
to be prom queen.

42
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,444
God, amber,
what do you want?

43
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,363
Every vote
in the whole school?

44
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,368
Yes.

45
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:44,414
Remember that sad sickly
boy who died last year?

46
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,375
I want his vote.
Is anybody unclear?

47
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,168
Because I think
it's pretty simple.

48
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,294
So clear.
Like crystal.

49
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,462
Good.

50
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,422
oink, oink. Snore.

51
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,428
And go.

52
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,350
And music.

53
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:10,107
Crazy pig turns up
the volume.

54
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,405
Crazy pig goes overboard.

55
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,287
Pigs are exploding,
and I'm getting nothing.

56
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,372
It's just empty noise.

57
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,498
Maybe lisa should
speed it up a little bit.

58
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,333
I have an idea.

59
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,356
Yes! Finally!

60
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,526
Another artist to help carry the load.

61
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:55,569
Great, lisa.

62
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:57,321
Oh, good.
No one's in here.

63
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,322
Uh, excuse me.

64
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,532
Oh, forgive us-

65
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,577
Amber pollock
needs this room

66
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:04,578
<i>Important
strategy meeting.</i>

67
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,413
Now, get out.

68
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:09,291
Hey. You don't
own this school.

69
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,335
Watch out, girls.
The elf bites.

70
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,423
Yeah, she's right.
You can't do this.

71
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:19,218
It-it's not-

72
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:20,385
Well, it's just not-

73
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,471
What's the matter?
Piggy got your tongue?

74
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:25,349
No, carlita. More like
having no life got her tongue.

75
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:27,518
Go.

76
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,187
<i>As you can see,</i>

77
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,397
<i>When populars
and unpopulars collide,</i>

78
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,191
<i>It's not pretty.</i>

79
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,485
<i>Nevertheless,
it's sometimes inevitable-</i>

80
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:38,403
<i>Fate, as it were.</i>

81
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,364
<i>But I'm getting
ahead of myself.</i>

82
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,491
<i>Easy to do when
you're omniscient.</i>

83
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,368
<i>So, I'll just let
our tale unfold</i>

84
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,370
<i>And say no more.</i>

85
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,497
<i>Not another word.</i>

86
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,582
<i>Absolutely finished now.</i>

87
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:07,432
Mom?

88
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,434
Can you come up here?

89
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,270
Mom's on the phone.

90
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,439
Tell her I want her
to see my dress.

91
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,441
Mom, she wants you
to see her dress!

92
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:20,445
I'm working!
For god's sake.

93
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,575
I think you look
pretty, amber.

94
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,535
Whatever.

95
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,370
Look, we can't
represent these people

96
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:32,207
If they're just gonna
second-guess me

97
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,209
What is so important?

98
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,294
Do you like it?

99
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,628
What, the dress?
It's fine.

100
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:40,299
I was thinking maybe I could
wear your diamond hoops?

101
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,592
You know,
for good luck,

102
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,468
<i>Since you wore them
when you won prom queen.</i>

103
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,181
Amber, please don't tell me you're
relying on luck to win you a crown.

104
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:50,309
You have to reach out and
take the things you want.

105
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:54,146
I know. I just wanted
to show you my-

106
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,356
Oh, I had
another thought.

107
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,317
Yes. Right.

108
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,527
I think we should
delay...

109
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,453
It's just darling.
Ha ha ha!

110
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,371
Oh, no one will know
it was mine.

111
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,373
Yeah, it's been so long,
all the witnesses are dead.

112
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,375
Stop it.
Tonight can be fun

113
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,502
If you just let it be.

114
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,420
Are you gonna help me out
at all with this?

115
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:26,595
Honey, I know you're feeling
awkward going without a date,

116
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:29,598
But the school website said
there'll be lots of solo kids.

117
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,225
There's no stigma
to it.

118
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,477
No stigma at all.
Welcome, losers.

119
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,563
Hush. That is not the
attitude to walk in there with.

120
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,273
I said I'd go.
That's all you get.

121
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:45,364
Hey, you know what? I think
that's the dress I was wearing

122
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,407
When we made you.
Right, henry?

123
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,617
Stop.

124
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:51,537
Oh, he was such a tiger
back then.

125
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:53,330
Mom... Stop.

126
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:54,456
I know, I know.

127
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,386
"if accepted at juilliard...

128
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:09,513
I would be... "

129
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:14,268
So freakin' grateful
to have an actual life.

130
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,274
"if accepted...

131
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:24,444
"I would bring
my great enthusiasm

132
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,155
"for all musical forms...

133
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:32,411
Including voice
and composition. "

134
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,246
Hey!

135
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:37,249
I didn't think
I'd see you here! Ha!

136
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,458
Hey, nick,
how's it going?

137
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,544
What's up, man?
You ready for this?

138
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:45,465
Sure, nick.
I'd love to dance.

139
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:48,302
Just let me get rid of
my imaginary date first.

140
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,287
Here you go.

141
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,456
Heh. Seriously?

142
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,130
<i>Paisley, we're here. Great.</i>

143
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,216
Voting just ended.
Perfect timing.

144
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,470
What are you doing?

145
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,181
Dropping you off. There
aren't any close spots.

146
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:37,226
You don't really expect the queen
to walk in there alone, do you?

147
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,519
I need to make
an entrance.

148
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,145
Yeah, but I'm
not gonna-

149
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,396
Make a spot. Now.

150
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,362
oh, man.

151
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,613
Don't worry
about it, really.

152
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,204
Come on! Move it!

153
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,263
Hey, amber!

154
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,267
Hey, girl!

155
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,185
What's up, amber?

156
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,436
Hey, girl!

157
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,284
Yes, indeed.

158
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:39,204
Let's give it up
for mixmaster ashley eagle!

159
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,419
And, as our hard-working
vote committee

160
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,212
Is tallying up the results,

161
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:51,049
I'd like to welcome
all of the students tonight

162
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,385
Feel better, barry?

163
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,347
Awesome. Ah.

164
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,559
I've just been handed
an envelope.

165
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:03,228
I wonder what's inside.

166
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,606
What do you think,
mixmaster?

167
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,357
All right.

168
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:13,450
Now, this year's
ashley high school

169
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,328
Holy toledo! For the first time
in school history,

170
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,331
A unanimous decision...

171
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,632
Amber pollock!

172
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,260
Yes!

173
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,481
Amber, no!

174
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,483
It's too dangerous!
That crown is mine.

175
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,501
It's okay, it's okay.
I'm all right.

176
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:09,419
Stand back,
don't touch her.

177
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:12,172
People, hey...
I'm over here.

178
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:22,516
No, not moving at all.

179
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:24,309
Oh, yeah.

180
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,602
As a doornail.

181
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,232
No! I can't be dead!

182
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:31,608
This is so unfair!

183
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,318
I had it in my hands.

184
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,656
Are you kidding me?

185
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,290
I always knew heaven
wouldn't allow nasty cuticles.

186
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,666
Do you have
an appointment?

187
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,335
But no one's even here.

188
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,671
That's because they all
have their own place to wait.

189
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,175
Oh, so...

190
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,342
This isn't heaven?

191
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,261
Let's just say it's
kind of halfway-

192
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:01,263
Like limbo-
made just for you.

193
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,226
Ah. Amber pollock.

194
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:08,228
Date of death-
right now.

195
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,397
Can you believe how
speedy these gadgets are?

196
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,191
I really think
they're the future.

197
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,359
Oh. Oh, well...

198
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,320
Weren't you a nasty
piece of business.

199
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,487
What's that supposed
to mean?

200
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,531
Ashley high
consensus says...

201
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,283
"queen bitch".

202
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,286
Pretty hellish,
I'd say.

203
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,581
Hellish? That doesn't
mean I'm going to-

204
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:29,291
Not as yet.

205
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,168
Your life arc
was interrupted

206
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,544
Before reaching
its full formation,

207
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,297
So you're getting an
opportunity to raise your scores.

208
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,216
Putting it
in high school terms,

209
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,384
You're, like,
getting an extension.

210
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,387
Oh. So, I'm, like,
repeating a grade?

211
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,597
I have to go back?

212
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,432
Not in corporeal form.

213
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:47,226
You'll be more like
a spirit.

214
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:49,645
And you'll have a specific
task to accomplish.

215
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,272
If you succeed,
it's wings and a harp,

216
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:55,359
Never a bad hair day, and
you'll always be model-thin.

217
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,236
If you fail, well...

218
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:59,571
How do you look
in asbestos?

219
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,410
oh, lookie here.

220
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,579
The task they've given
you is rather ironic,

221
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,540
Since you were very nearly
crowned prom queen.

222
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,333
Oh, it was unanimous,
you know.

223
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,168
Lucky you.

224
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,462
You must take
the least popular student

225
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:19,135
And get this individual
elected queen

226
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,467
What?

227
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,469
And here she is-

228
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,221
The misshapen
lump of clay

229
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:25,556
That you must mold.

230
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:26,598
She doesn't go
to my school.

231
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,601
Lisa sommers.

232
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,353
Been in your class
for eight years.

233
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:34,189
She was your lab partner
in freshman biology.

234
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,525
No. I've never
seen her in my life.

235
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,610
Maybe this will help.

236
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:42,281
<i>That girl?
Prom queen?</i>

237
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:43,448
That's a joke.

238
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:46,660
Listen, sister,
you have one week.

239
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,183
Is best expressed
by those closest

240
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:10,475
To the one we have lost.

241
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,520
Thank you to those
who showed up today.

242
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:17,357
Well, this seems to be it,
so we might as well start.

243
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,484
Is this all for me?

244
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,320
So, I'd like to invite those
who were closest to amber

245
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,239
To come up and share
your love for her.

246
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,450
A memory, an anecdote,

247
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,328
A short story of what
she meant to you.

248
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,497
Let me just say thank you.

249
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,290
Thank you all.

250
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:42,341
Hello?

251
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:45,594
We have microphones on
either side of the stage,

252
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:50,349
So please take
as much time as needed

253
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:57,564
All right, then.

254
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,274
Hey.

255
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:02,194
Let's have a moment
of silence for amber.

256
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:06,198
Oh, honey.

257
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:08,534
On prom night, of all
nights, she's gotta die.

258
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:12,371
She promised me
- promised that when she got that crown,

259
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,331
She was finally
gonna let me do her.

260
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:17,125
I dented my car
because of her.

261
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:20,212
And what do I get?
Nothing.

262
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:21,505
This is worse than dying!

263
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:24,383
Where is my group?
Where are my girls?

264
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:36,270
That was beautiful.

265
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:39,356
I will now unveil
the memorial portrait

266
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:42,150
That will hang
on the wall

267
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:46,446
Where we
hang pictures

268
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:58,250
Oh! You like the photo I picked?

269
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,257
Stop laughing, all of you!

270
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,467
I demand you
to stop laughing now!

271
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,178
Amber?

272
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,264
Do you see
what I see?

273
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:14,099
I see justice.

274
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,601
Why, what do you see?

275
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,146
no! No!

276
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:20,439
Lisa?

277
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,567
Okie-dokie.
That was so moving.

278
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:26,195
Well, the Saturday
committees

279
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,113
For make-up prom

280
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,406
Will meet after lunch.

281
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:31,533
And let's make it a
safe one, okay, people?

282
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:34,453
Where are you all going?

283
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:37,122
This is so wrong.
You all love me.

284
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:39,166
Somebody say something now.
I'm popular!

285
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,501
<i>I'm tmost popular!</i>

286
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:45,130
You! You can see me.

287
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,216
Mm-mm. No.
No, I can't.

288
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:48,467
<i>You can see me,
and you can hear me.</i>

289
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:50,302
Mm-mm! Wait, come back!
I need to talk to you!

290
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,485
There you are.
Stay right there.

291
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,285
Whoa.

292
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,080
That was kind of cool.

293
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:21,416
Hey.

294
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,339
Oh. Hello.

295
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,550
That's 20 minutes of my
life I'm never getting back.

296
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,468
Hey, the girl died.

297
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,137
It's genuinely sad.
Show a little respect.

298
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,557
Aw, bless you,
nameless nerd boy.

299
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:46,191
And everyone wonders
why I never date.

300
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,193
Chicks are just crazy.

301
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:55,325
It's just stress, lisa.
That's all.

302
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:58,203
Music school applications,
senior anxiety.

303
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,455
It's a natural reaction.

304
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:03,125
You know, this whole
"you run, I chase" thing

305
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:05,210
Is getting
boring fast.

306
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,130
Why are you here?
What did I do?

307
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:09,548
Nothing,
from what I can tell.

308
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:12,217
<i>It's whi'm
gonna do for you.</i>

309
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,552
Get out of here. Now.

310
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:15,345
Hey,
it's a public bathroom.

311
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:18,223
Yes, of course.

312
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,058
Okay, I'll give you
five minutes.

313
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,310
Just not in here.

314
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,527
Prom queen-

315
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:32,487
Me?
Yep, by Saturday.

316
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,573
Okay. Joke's over.

317
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:37,117
Lisa sommers officially
looks like a fool.

318
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,368
Hooray to whoever's
doing this.

319
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,162
Do you really think I
could make all this up?

320
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:42,164
I have to admit,
you're not that smart.

321
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:43,165
Excuse me!

322
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:44,416
It just doesn't
make sense.

323
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,293
<i>Why would I
want to help you?</i>

324
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:49,254
Because... I'm the only
one that can help you.

325
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,590
Don't you see? I can make you popular.

326
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,300
I don't want
to be popular.

327
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:55,469
Oh. Poor thing.

328
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:57,346
Everyone wants
to be popular.

329
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,223
In five days
with me in charge,

330
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:00,432
You'll be the talk
of the school.

331
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:02,267
Everyone
will be wondering,

332
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,519
"what's liza wearing
today? What's liza thinking?

333
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,270
Where's liza going
tonight?"

334
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,231
It's lisa.

335
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:09,066
Well, if you're popular,
people would know that.

336
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,150
My friends
know my name.

337
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:11,401
All two of them?
Three!

338
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,278
Okay, mousy bits, if you
don't want to be popular,

339
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,113
What exactly
do you want?

340
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:20,285
I want to get
out of here.

341
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,120
I want to go
to music school.

342
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,372
I want to live in a world
where they don't judge you

343
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:26,291
By how many people want
to sit with you at lunch.

344
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,460
Instead...

345
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,295
They appreciate
the fact

346
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:33,131
That your playlist not only
has the newest gaga,

347
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,550
But all of
haydn's symphonies,

348
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,468
Charles ives'
concord sonata,

349
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,428
And the ella fitzgerald
songbooks,

350
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,305
Because they're
all magic works of genius,

351
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:42,182
And they transport me.

352
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,312
You done yet?

353
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,480
You're deader
than I am.

354
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,274
And you're
a vacuous shrew.

355
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:52,526
Come on! You have
to do this for me,

356
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:55,112
Otherwise they're sending me
to hell, and I don't want to go.

357
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,197
Why? There'll be so many
people just like you.

358
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,157
I can't believe you
don't want to help me.

359
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,450
You know what?

360
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,286
I don't think I'm gonna get
another chance to say this

361
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,537
And really
make it happen,

362
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:06,331
But, for all I care,
you can go to hell.

363
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:18,218
She's stubborn,
doesn't listen to reason,

364
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,013
And she only cares about
what she wants. I hate her!

365
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,223
Why? Too much
like yourself?

366
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:26,143
I offered her the greatest
gift of high school-

367
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:27,895
Complete popularity.

368
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,771
And she tells me
to go to hell.

369
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,106
Amber,
dear, sweet child,

370
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:33,066
Sometimes we can't
accomplish a task

371
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,818
Simply by browbeating
the weak.

372
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,904
Why not?
Often-

373
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:38,780
And I know this is a
radical notion for you-

374
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:41,825
We must actually think
of the other person.

375
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:48,040
But that sounds
really hard.

376
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,792
Very well, then. We won't put
you through any more of this.

377
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,839
hello, this is j-3
in arbitration.

378
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:57,799
I have
a miss amber pollock.

379
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,177
She's given up and is
ready for processing.

380
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:02,930
Uh-huh.

381
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,890
I'll ask.

382
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:07,893
Would you prefer being
slowly skinned by demons,

383
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:12,022
Or having your pretty nails
pulled out, one by one?

384
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:16,068
I know. Hard to imagine clawing
your way past the little people

385
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:20,906
Without ten little talons of
sinful ruby rouge number 17.

386
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:22,157
Tacky, by the way.

387
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:25,911
I guess I can give lisa
one more shot.

388
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:28,831
You'd do that for her?

389
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:30,040
How sweet.

390
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:31,792
Uhh!

391
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:33,877
You have ghostly powers.
Use them.

392
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,177
Lise, I've been
waiting for you.

393
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:43,887
I didn't want to
come up behind you

394
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:45,973
'cause I noticed
you were kind of jumpy.

395
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:47,182
What? Wha-wha-
what makes you say that?

396
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:50,018
The fact that you're...
Kind of jumpy.

397
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:53,021
Are you okay?

398
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:54,773
What happened
this morning?

399
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:55,941
Can I ask you
something?

400
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:57,818
But you have to promise
to keep it between us.

401
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,069
Come on,
we're best friends.

402
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:03,073
What if I told you amber
pollock visited me today?

403
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:05,951
You mean, like,
as a ghost,

404
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:07,786
Or some kind of spirit?

405
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:09,913
Ohh. Just hearing
the words out loud

406
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:11,165
Makes it seem
even more crazy.

407
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:12,791
Forget I said
anything.

408
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,002
Lise, you're
freaking me out.

409
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,879
Are you really
seeing amber?

410
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,797
I don't know, selena.

411
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,008
Maybe this is just some
kind of freakish dream.

412
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,927
Or maybe I'm actually unconscious
from a dangerously high fever

413
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:25,220
That's causing me
to hallucinate,

414
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,890
And hopefully sweat off that
donut I ate this morning.

415
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:30,934
Or maybe I'm just
going completely insane.

416
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:33,812
Okay, not true. A lot
of people see ghosts.

417
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:35,814
My aunt marielle
- she sees them all the time.

418
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:37,816
Of course,
there was that one week

419
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,067
When she only bathed
in ketchup.

420
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,944
But she's not insane.

421
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:42,863
And she says that ghosts
are nothing to mess with.

422
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:44,156
So, you better
be careful here.

423
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:47,993
You know what?
I don't even have time

424
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:49,244
To think about this
right now.

425
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:51,079
Whatever it was
is gone, thank god,

426
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:53,749
And I have to concentrate on
the real things in my life.

427
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,125
You mean you're gonna
go out to the field

428
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,252
And pretend to do your homework
while you stare at nick ramsey?

429
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:59,046
Okay, so, it's more
of a delusion,

430
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,923
But, uh, I'm
comfortable with it.

431
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:02,758
As long as you're sure
you're okay.

432
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,927
Yeah. Thanks.

433
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:10,766
Hey, nick!
This one's to you!

434
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:15,896
Oh. Nick ramsey.

435
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:17,940
Uhh. Please get out
of my life.

436
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:20,817
Whoo! Yay, nick!
Nice butt!

437
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:21,985
Good choice.

438
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:24,780
Choice? He doesn't
even know I'm alive.

439
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,114
I could get him
for you.

440
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:30,077
What if I told you

441
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:34,081
I could have you
in his arms like that?

442
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:35,874
Yeah, right.

443
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,210
Blue 42! Hut! Hike!

444
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:50,973
Heads up! Look out!

445
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:56,144
Are you okay?

446
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:00,732
Oh-

447
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:04,027
You're lisa sommers,
right?

448
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,071
You and your friends make
those clay pig movies?

449
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:08,824
I watch them online.
They're funny.

450
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,703
Lisa. I'm-
I'm lisa.

451
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:13,996
Nick! You done
over there, man?

452
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:16,915
I gotta go.

453
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:23,797
A lot more where
that came from.

454
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,883
He has strong hands.

455
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:28,010
And he's just
between girlfriends.

456
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,761
Perfect time
to make your move.

457
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:32,014
No, no, I can't.
I'm just-I'm not-

458
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:35,851
No, no, no.
I'm not. I'm not.

459
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:37,144
Well said.

460
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:44,067
We were almost friends
in the seventh grade.

461
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:45,194
A bunch of us
went over to his house

462
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:47,738
To watch him feed
his pet snake.

463
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:49,740
Then everything changed
over the summer.

464
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:52,201
Some girls got breasts. I
got braces and piano lessons.

465
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:54,828
And he got tall
and athletic.

466
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,830
And we all know
how that turned out.

467
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:58,123
I always wondered
what might've happened

468
00:24:58,165 --> 00:24:59,875
If I just had
the courage to say,

469
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:02,961
"hey, nick, cool snake,"
you know?

470
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:04,880
You're like a human
sleeping pill.

471
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,715
Please don't ever talk
like that on a date.

472
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:07,883
But he knows my name.

473
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:09,092
And he's seen
pig tales.

474
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:10,928
Maybe I should leave him
a cool little message

475
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:12,721
In the next movie.

476
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:13,972
Look, I only have
five days.

477
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:15,891
You don't have to like me,
but I know how to hook a boy.

478
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:17,976
Are you really willing to pass that up?

479
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:20,103
Okay, it all starts
with how you look.

480
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,731
I know, I know. It's what's
on the inside that counts-

481
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:24,942
Blah, blah-which only ugly
people say, by the way.

482
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:28,153
But we're talking about
hardball high school popularity,

483
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:30,113
Which is based on looks
by about...

484
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:32,950
Hmm, 170%.

485
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:35,202
And the good news is,
you're not ugly...

486
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:37,079
Exactly.

487
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,956
You just gotta work
on your presentation.

488
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:40,916
And that's what
my life is all about.

489
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:42,084
Was.

490
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,919
<i>Okay, fine. Was.</i>

491
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:45,796
That's why we're
doing this together.

492
00:25:45,838 --> 00:25:47,130
You're gonna help me
get into heaven,

493
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:49,925
And I'm gonna help
get nick into you.

494
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:51,760
Emotionally.

495
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:55,180
Wait.
That's my sister.

496
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:02,062
That's clementine.

497
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:04,940
God,
she looks so sad.

498
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:07,776
I wonder
what happened.

499
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:09,152
You died on Saturday.

500
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:10,946
Oh, yeah.

501
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:12,781
Hey, listen,
I gotta go.

502
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:13,949
I'll catch you
later.

503
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:15,826
In the meantime,
wax.

504
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:17,786
Everything.

505
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:33,969
Hey, mom.

506
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:36,138
Did you go to the office at all today?

507
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,807
Your sister got into
washington college.

508
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:40,184
I didn't even know
she applied.

509
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:42,019
Why didn't she tell me?

510
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,812
<i>I did tell you.
Sdid tell you.</i>

511
00:26:43,854 --> 00:26:45,063
But you said
I wasn't good enough

512
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:46,857
To get into the school
where you went.

513
00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:48,150
Now what do I do
with this?

514
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,943
I'm gonna
start dinner,

515
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:51,987
'cause people get
hungry, you know?

516
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:55,782
You did it, honey...

517
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:57,993
With no help from me.

518
00:26:57,993 --> 00:27:00,913
You went out and got it.

519
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,915
I'll be damned.

520
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:10,130
Hmm.

521
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:13,675
You-lisa sommers-

522
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:14,968
Actually spoke
to nick ramsey?

523
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,094
Mm-hmm. I did.

524
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:17,179
Clear.
Clear.

525
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:18,764
Perfecto.

526
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:21,183
Click me off
two frames, raj.

527
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:22,809
It's speaking to me,
people.

528
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:24,144
Let's pick it up.

529
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:26,021
Today you finally
talked to him

530
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:28,190
After five years
of slack-jawed gawking.

531
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,943
Mm-hmm. I don't know,
things just-

532
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:32,861
Things just happen.
It was weird.

533
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:35,030
No, they don't.
Not with you.

534
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:36,865
Clear.

535
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:39,117
Wait, wait, cut. I want to
shoot this next one from above.

536
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:41,036
Let's go outside
and grab the ladder.

537
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:44,081
Are you sure
you're okay?

538
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:46,792
Because earlier, things
got a little, well...

539
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:47,960
You know.

540
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:50,170
Of course.
I'm better than okay.

541
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:53,715
I'm thinking of running
for prom queen.

542
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:55,884
What?

543
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:57,052
Okay.

544
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:00,055
Who was the first boy
that ever tried to kiss me,

545
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:01,932
And when did it happen?

546
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:04,059
What are you-
just answer the question.

547
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:07,104
It was
your cousin leo...

548
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:08,814
At your grandma's house
when you were ten.

549
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:10,107
What the hell
is wrong with you?

550
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:12,693
I had to make sure
it was still you in there.

551
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:15,112
Seriously? Prom queen?

552
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:18,740
Who are you?

553
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:22,953
Prom queen.

554
00:28:22,995 --> 00:28:24,163
Hmm.

555
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:31,670
♪ no, I don't care ♪

556
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:34,798

557
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:37,634

everything to me... ♪

558
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:39,970

00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:43,891
♪ no, I don't care ♪

560
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:45,809

561
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:46,894
Excuse me.

562
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:48,729
Nice voice
in there, girl.

563
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:49,938
And the sweet tune
- is that something you wrote?

564
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,982
Have you ever heard
of a thing called privacy?

565
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:54,985
I knew I had my work
cut out for me, but this-

566
00:28:54,985 --> 00:28:56,987
Please! I mean, nothing
goes with anything.

567
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:59,615
The salvation army would
reject this entire closet.

568
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:00,824
You're not going
to school today.

569
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:02,576
What? Why?

570
00:29:02,618 --> 00:29:03,660
You're calling in
unattractive.

571
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:04,912
We're gonna go
to the mall

572
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:06,747
And get you some outfits
from this time period.

573
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,836
Are you all right?
Did you see your sister?

574
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:14,838
Yeah, I saw her.

575
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,590
Is she okay?

576
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:17,799
Let's just focus
on the job at hand,

577
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:19,009
Which is making you
look better.

578
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:20,719
I could use a little
of your help.

579
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:22,846
Lise, were you talking to somebody?

580
00:29:22,888 --> 00:29:24,723
No.

581
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:26,725
Not really.

582
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:28,977
Mom, I was thinking of
skipping school today

583
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:30,896
So maybe I could go
buy a new outfit

584
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:33,023
For Saturday's
make-up prom.

585
00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:34,691
Are you crazy?

586
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:35,859
You can't tell your mom you're cutting.

587
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:38,779
You want to buy
a new outfit?

588
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,948
Oh, honey!

589
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:43,033
That's wonderful!

590
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:46,078
Do you need money? I'll just take
some out of your dad's wallet.

591
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:52,960
So, do you always tell
your parents the truth?

592
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:55,879
I mean, like, what do
you do when you sneak out?

593
00:29:55,921 --> 00:29:57,047
I don't sneak out.

594
00:29:57,089 --> 00:30:00,676
Come on. Even amish
girls sneak out to...

595
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:02,678
Raise a barn
or something.

596
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:06,849
Did you have to
make it this hard?

597
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:11,061
Try on
that blue outfit.

598
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,078
How do you like it?

599
00:30:29,163 --> 00:30:31,790
This is not me.
That's the point.

600
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:33,750
<i>If they sold you here,
they'd go out of business.</i>

601
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,752
I cannot wear
something like this.

602
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:36,795
Why? Someone might
find out you're cute?

603
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:38,005
I am not cute.

604
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:39,840
I hate to be the one
to deliver the bad news,

605
00:30:39,882 --> 00:30:41,758
But you are.
You've got boobs,

606
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:44,052
Which you seem to be in
denial about, and actual legs,

607
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:45,137
Which you could
show off on occasion.

608
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:46,805
And...

609
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:47,973
A perfectly nice little
butt, I have to say.

610
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:49,850
Are you coming on to me?
Honey...

611
00:30:49,892 --> 00:30:51,018
I'm telling you
what guys like.

612
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:52,102
And it's not
that complicated.

613
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:53,187
Now, zip it down.

614
00:30:58,025 --> 00:30:59,693
Hike it up.

615
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:02,112
The dress.

616
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:07,117
Now do this.

617
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,913
No, I refuse.

618
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:11,997
Do it.
Think of nick.

619
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:16,960
You're not ready
for that.

620
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,754
Let's stick to the
clothes. Hold that one up.

621
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:23,884
No, you couldn't pull it off. Could.

622
00:31:23,926 --> 00:31:26,094
Oh, I would so kill
in that dress.

623
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:29,806
How'd you do that?

624
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:31,725
I don't know.

625
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:33,769
I thought I was gonna be stuck
in that prom dress forever.

626
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,103
Oh, my god.

627
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:38,815
I have fashion powers!
Ha ha!

628
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:27,781
You told her we're meeting
for lunch, right?

629
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:29,700
You were standing
right there, colin.

630
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:30,951
Then she must be
sick or something.

631
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:32,786
Well, she'd better not
be blowing us off.

632
00:32:32,828 --> 00:32:34,079
Who said we were
being blown off?

633
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:39,209
She-she wouldn't do that.

634
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:48,969
Hmm. How about a shorter
cut with some highlights?

635
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:50,762
No.

636
00:32:50,804 --> 00:32:52,931
Okay. What about
a swoop bang

637
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:54,766
And some lowlights?

638
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:56,018
I don't think so.

639
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:57,769
Maybe we should just
turn the lights off.

640
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:59,062
Hey.

641
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:01,064
We can dye it blond.

642
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:04,735
Bad idea.

643
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:06,737
I know what'll
fix this mess.

644
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:08,739
Let's add
some length.

645
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:14,703
Oh, that's nice.

646
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:27,090
Now, every girl needs
her signature scents

647
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:28,926
That their boy
can find in the dark.

648
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:31,094
Great. So, it's like
being sniffed out by a dog.

649
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:34,765
look at that.

650
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:37,142
What? Zac efron boy over there.

651
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:43,732
He's not
looking at me.

652
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:45,150
Well, he's sure not
looking at me.

653
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:47,736
This is perfect-
a starter boy.

654
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:48,946
Call him over.

655
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:50,906
I don't know his name.

656
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:54,159
Call him over.

657
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:07,005
Hi.

658
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:10,133
Um... I never know what
to say to a pretty girl.

659
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:12,135
Well, that's not
a bad start.

660
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:14,763
Say it. That's not a bad start.

661
00:34:14,805 --> 00:34:17,975
Damn cute, isn't he?

662
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:19,643
Just say hi.
Hi.

663
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:21,061
Hi, my name's aiden.

664
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:24,106
Now tell him your name.
Back off.

665
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:25,732
I'm sorry, I was just-

666
00:34:25,774 --> 00:34:27,150
No, no, no, no.
You're fine.

667
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,151
Oh.

668
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:30,779
I'm lisa.
And I have to go.

669
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:31,989
What?
Right now?

670
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,907
Yep. I was just here
buying things for my prom,

671
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,033
And now I'm done.

672
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:37,119
What are you doing?
He's great.

673
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:39,705
If I come by tomorrow,
will I see you?

674
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:41,790
I don't know.
Probably not.

675
00:34:41,832 --> 00:34:43,000
Bye.

676
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,960
You just discarded
a perfect good boy.

677
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:46,044
Congrats.

678
00:34:46,086 --> 00:34:47,796
What if it led
to something?

679
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:49,047
What if he
asked me out?

680
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:51,133
This is about nick, not
some cute guy in a store.

681
00:34:51,175 --> 00:34:52,926
These moral convictions
of yours

682
00:34:52,968 --> 00:34:54,178
Are only getting
in the way.

683
00:35:11,862 --> 00:35:13,655
Everybody's gonna
laugh at me.

684
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:15,699
They're gonna say, "who
are you trying to fool?"

685
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:18,035
I'm going home.
No, you're not.

686
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:19,828
Do you want to be
an unpopular nonentity

687
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,079
For the rest
of your life?

688
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:22,915
Yes. I'm good at it.

689
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:24,917
This is about confidence.

690
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,752
Nobody actually has it.

691
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:29,046
You just
have to project it.

692
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:32,716
I'm out.

693
00:35:32,758 --> 00:35:34,676
No, you're not.

694
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:41,892
That was so weird. What
the hell just happened?

695
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:43,936
I don't know.

696
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:46,188
But I love that
I can do that.

697
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:53,111
Would you stop fighting me?

698
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:55,072
What am I supposed to do?

699
00:35:55,072 --> 00:35:57,074
Nothing. Let me drive.

700
00:35:57,074 --> 00:36:00,869
No. Yes. No! Yes!

701
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:02,079
Go!

702
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:29,064
This is amazing.
Quiet!

703
00:36:29,106 --> 00:36:30,816
Morning, boys.

704
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:32,651
Could you do me
the hugest favor?

705
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:34,111
I need your signature for
my prom queen petition?

706
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:35,821
Would you mind?

707
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:38,657
<i>Thank you.
Thank you.</i>

708
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:40,784
Luke, that's a great shirt.
Looks so good on you.

709
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:42,953
Kyle, did you get
a haircut? 'cause it works.

710
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:45,956
This is fun.

711
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:47,916
What the hell
happened to her?

712
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:49,918
She's obviously
not sick.

713
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,962
She looks great-
like a different person.

714
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:54,131
Yeah, a person
crying for help.

715
00:36:57,718 --> 00:36:59,136
Oh, my god, what a rush!

716
00:36:59,136 --> 00:37:01,054
Is this what popularity
feels like?

717
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:03,640
Yes. And that's
just a taste.

718
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,893
You want to fly solo?

719
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:07,811
Can I?

720
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:14,902
Let's see it.

721
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,822
No, no, no.
Not them.

722
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:21,074
They have no heat. You
need to seek the heat.

723
00:37:23,994 --> 00:37:25,662
Yes. Nice.

724
00:37:25,704 --> 00:37:27,664
That's some heat.

725
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:28,790
Hi, adam.

726
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:30,083
Lisa, is that you?

727
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:34,004
Would you do me the
giant-est favor in the world?

728
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:36,048
Have you been
working out?

729
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:37,674
Like, at the gym
and stuff?

730
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:39,009
Yeah. See you.

731
00:37:42,804 --> 00:37:45,682
Well, look at you, all
talking to the boys.

732
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:48,060
I'm gonna walk down this
hallway for the rest of my life.

733
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:51,939
Hey, has anybody here not signed
carlita's prom queen petition?

734
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,107
carlita's running
against me?

735
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:55,818
I mean, against you?

736
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:57,861
Is that bad?
It's terrible.

737
00:37:57,903 --> 00:37:59,822
I taught her everything.
She'll annihilate us.

738
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:01,782
Come on.
You're amber pollock.

739
00:38:01,824 --> 00:38:03,700
What does she have
that we don't?

740
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:08,747
Nick.
Nick.

741
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:30,811
I thought you said he
was between girlfriends.

742
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:32,646
<i>That's not between.
That's on.</i>

743
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:33,939
Did you see
that kiss?

744
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:35,732
How could carlita
do this to me?

745
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:38,694
That crown was mine to
give, and I didn't pick her.

746
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:40,821
That wannabe is not
sending me to hell.

747
00:38:40,863 --> 00:38:43,866
He's never gonna put his big
strong hand on my butt again.

748
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:45,951
We can still
get him for you...

749
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:47,744
As soon as we stop
carlita.

750
00:38:47,786 --> 00:38:50,706
We just have to figure
out what her next move is.

751
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:51,999
How?

752
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,709
Gee, I don't know.

753
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:54,960
It's not like
one of us is invisible

754
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:56,879
And can walk through walls
or anything.

755
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:03,010
Here he comes.

756
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:05,596
Looks like he's
getting over amber.

757
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:07,723
So, how come you didn't
go for brandon?

758
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:09,725
And look like I'm
picking up amber's scraps?

759
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:11,685
No. That's a loser move.

760
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:13,979
I wanted somebody
on the way up-nick.

761
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,898
Smart move.

762
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:18,734
Way up. Nick.

763
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,069
She's in my seat.

764
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:22,905
All right, guys,
Friday night,

765
00:39:22,905 --> 00:39:24,615
Everybody who's cool...

766
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:25,657
Will be at my house.

767
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:27,034
Next day...

768
00:39:27,075 --> 00:39:28,911
Everybody's buzzing
about it,

769
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:31,038
Which carries right into the
prom voting Saturday night.

770
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,625
So, it has to be
a great party.

771
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:35,834
Uh... Mm.

772
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:37,794
Paisley, can you get
your stoner brother

773
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:39,838
To stop playing video games
long enough to buy us beer?

774
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,674
Good. And, dakota...
"dakota... "

775
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:44,801
Your friend's band-
panda house- get them.

776
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:46,762
But they don't do
parties anymore.

777
00:39:46,762 --> 00:39:48,847
Tell them you'll
sleep with them.

778
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:50,766
Okay.

779
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:53,644
All right, these are
all the important people.

780
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:57,105
Oh, um, why not invite
everybody to the party?

781
00:39:57,147 --> 00:39:59,691
Paisley, you still need
a ruling class

782
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:01,652
For the pathetic people
to look up to.

783
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:05,656
If I invite the masses, I
come off as... Approachable.

784
00:40:05,697 --> 00:40:07,825
And that's dead.

785
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:10,035
Not stupid
amber electrocution dead,

786
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:11,870
But pretty close.

787
00:40:14,915 --> 00:40:17,042
You... Look thirsty.

788
00:40:17,084 --> 00:40:18,794
Let's roll, girls.

789
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,925
Oh.

790
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:26,677
The world has people
for that.

791
00:40:26,718 --> 00:40:27,803
Heh.

792
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:30,973
Uhh!

793
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:35,060
Thanks, aunt marielle.

794
00:40:35,102 --> 00:40:36,854
You're the only one
who can help me.

795
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:37,980
Give me the photos.

796
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:39,731
Something is
definitely going on.

797
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:41,692
I don't if she's trying
to take over lisa's body,

798
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:44,027
Or steal her soul,
or god knows what.

799
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:46,905
But I'm not giving up my
best friend without a fight.

800
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:48,991
We must break her grip
and deliver this amber

801
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:50,159
To her ultimate
destination.

802
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,953
But how? We can't
even see her.

803
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:55,914
You don't see spirits
with your eyes.

804
00:40:55,956 --> 00:40:58,876
You see them with...
Inner vision.

805
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:02,129
Like eyes...
Inside your body.

806
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:05,883
And you wonder why people
think you're a whack-job?

807
00:41:05,924 --> 00:41:07,634
do you want
to see the ghost?

808
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:08,802
Yes.

809
00:41:08,844 --> 00:41:10,095
I will attempt
to conjure her

810
00:41:10,137 --> 00:41:12,014
From these photos.

811
00:41:18,854 --> 00:41:21,064
She was very powerful
in life, wasn't she?

812
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:24,693
Think medusa with blond
snakes and killer pumps.

813
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:28,822
Now, this amber-

814
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:31,950
Her soul is in peril, and
your friend is the key.

815
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:33,869
Does that mean
lisa's in danger?

816
00:41:33,911 --> 00:41:36,038
It does.
Their bond is strong.

817
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:37,998
There's only one way
to stop her.

818
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,124
Tell me.

819
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:40,918
What's the last thing
amber touched

820
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:42,753
Before she left
this plane?

821
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:44,922
I know.

822
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:47,841
And I'm gonna get it.

823
00:41:57,726 --> 00:42:00,729
I'm gonna get ya,
ghost bitch.

824
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:17,746
Carlita's
throwing a party?

825
00:42:17,788 --> 00:42:19,706
Yes, and that's why you're
gonna throw one, too.

826
00:42:19,748 --> 00:42:20,874
Won't hers be better?

827
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:22,960
Let's just say hers
is gonna run into...

828
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:24,711
A little trouble.

829
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:25,921
This one's
still logged on.

830
00:42:25,963 --> 00:42:28,090
Great. That way, they
can't trace it back to you.

831
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:29,925
This is so wrong.

832
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:31,844
What's your point?
Write the email?

833
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:33,762
Right.

834
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:37,683
Oh, wait. You got
carlita's address wrong.

835
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:38,934
<i>It's fairview place,
nlane.</i>

836
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:41,979
Come on.

837
00:42:46,024 --> 00:42:48,026
Ready to send?

838
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:50,779
I feel almost...
Criminal.

839
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:52,698
Do you want to feel
almost nick?

840
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:54,700
Sending.

841
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:56,034
Oh! It's out there.

842
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:57,786
Blackberries are jingling,
iphones are shaking,

843
00:42:57,828 --> 00:42:59,079
People are buzzing.

844
00:42:59,121 --> 00:43:02,749
I feel it, too.
Being bad is exciting.

845
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:04,042
Welcome to life.

846
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:05,711
Now let's go.

847
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:18,932
Party time!

848
00:43:18,974 --> 00:43:20,684
What are you doing here?

849
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:21,768
Party!
Party!

850
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:22,853
The party's tomorrow.

851
00:43:22,895 --> 00:43:24,938
The message.
What message?

852
00:43:26,148 --> 00:43:27,858
I didn't send that.

853
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,942
Say cheese!
No, don't!

854
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:30,736
What the hell is this?

855
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:33,739
Get in the car!
Come on, you punk!

856
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,115
I'm calling the police.

857
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:40,913
Hey, there's
another party!

858
00:44:06,772 --> 00:44:08,649
Lisa, when did you
plan this party?

859
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,818
You know, I just kind of
threw it together.

860
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:12,653
And my parents got
a free spa weekend,

861
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:13,779
So you could put
those drinks anywhere.

862
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:14,947
Lisa, the band's here.

863
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:16,824
Thank you for doing this
on such short notice.

864
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:19,660
No problem.
We're gonna go set up.

865
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:20,953
It was fantastic.

866
00:44:20,994 --> 00:44:22,788
Carlita never knew
what hit her.

867
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,666
Awesome party, lisa.
Have a nice time.

868
00:44:25,707 --> 00:44:27,668
People are really
showing up.

869
00:44:27,709 --> 00:44:28,877
Go ahead and mix. Don't
stay here in the corner,

870
00:44:28,919 --> 00:44:29,962
Talking
to yourself, girl.

871
00:44:30,003 --> 00:44:31,129
Right. That was
the old me.

872
00:44:31,171 --> 00:44:32,840
Actually, the old you
never went to parties.

873
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:34,091
Right again.

874
00:44:34,132 --> 00:44:35,843
I'd love to stay
and chat, but...

875
00:44:35,884 --> 00:44:36,927
I've got a party
to host.

876
00:44:42,891 --> 00:44:46,019
How do people leave the
house without my help?

877
00:44:46,061 --> 00:44:47,813
Ech.

878
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:54,153
I'm a little confused.

879
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:56,864
Why would carlita send us
to a party that isn't hers?

880
00:44:56,905 --> 00:44:59,658
We're checking up on the
competition. It's intelligence.

881
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,909
Oh, cool.

882
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:02,703
I love being
intelligence.

883
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:04,872
God, this is such a great
party. Totally great.

884
00:45:04,913 --> 00:45:06,790
It's like something
amber would've done.

885
00:45:06,832 --> 00:45:07,916
You think?

886
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,678
Nick is here. I don't know what to say.

887
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,807
You're not gonna
sanything.

888
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:26,852
I called carlita,
and she was crying,

889
00:45:26,894 --> 00:45:28,896
And she started
yelling.

890
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:30,022
I asked her
what happened,

891
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:31,648
But she just
hung up on me.

892
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:32,733
I'll tell you
what happened.

893
00:45:32,774 --> 00:45:33,859
Somebody
burned her good.

894
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:36,028
Huh. Should I
call her again?

895
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:37,779
No. She'll just
hang up.

896
00:45:37,821 --> 00:45:39,656
Best party
of the year.

897
00:45:39,698 --> 00:45:43,827
So, whose house
is this, anyway?

898
00:45:43,869 --> 00:45:45,078
Lisa sommers-
that music weirdo

899
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,997
Who suddenly turned,
like, red-hot in two days.

900
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:48,749
<i>So red-hot.</i>

901
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:50,876
Hmm.

902
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:52,002
Are you kidding me?

903
00:45:52,044 --> 00:45:53,754
I only do that
in the shower.

904
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:55,797
That's it, I'm coming in. You cannot-

905
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,674
You cannot make me.

906
00:45:57,716 --> 00:45:59,801
Stop it. Stop it!
Get out of me!

907
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:00,969
Get out of me!

908
00:46:13,732 --> 00:46:16,652
Can you guys do me the
hugest favor in the world?

909
00:46:19,822 --> 00:46:22,783
Just keep it simple
and follow me. Thanks.

That-
that was amazing.

948
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:05,612
The things I have to do
to get your attention.

949
00:49:05,654 --> 00:49:06,780
Nice.

950
00:49:06,822 --> 00:49:07,990
Thank you.

951
00:49:08,031 --> 00:49:09,908
<i>No, thank you.</i>

952
00:49:16,957 --> 00:49:19,626
You really surprised
people tonight.

953
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:21,879
Did I surprise you?

954
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,715
Yes, you did.

955
00:49:26,008 --> 00:49:28,886
You know, I've kind of
been going out with carlita,

956
00:49:28,927 --> 00:49:31,096
But it's not
really serious.

957
00:49:31,138 --> 00:49:32,973
It's just been
a few days.

958
00:49:37,728 --> 00:49:40,022
Do you remember back in
the seventh grade

959
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:41,815
When I had
a bunch of people over

960
00:49:41,857 --> 00:49:43,650
To watch me feed jimbo?

961
00:49:43,692 --> 00:49:45,068
You know, my pet snake.

962
00:49:46,862 --> 00:49:48,780
I was thinking about that the other day.

963
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:50,032
You were there,
right?

964
00:49:51,742 --> 00:49:53,744
Wow.

965
00:49:53,785 --> 00:49:55,829
Seventh grade-
um, maybe.

966
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:57,831
Who even remembers
that far back?

967
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:12,846
I'm gonna go tell carlita
things aren't working out.

968
00:50:12,846 --> 00:50:14,056
I would like that.

969
00:50:14,097 --> 00:50:15,724
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

970
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:36,078
Oh, my god.
She looks horrible.

971
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:37,329
So horrible.

972
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:39,373
I know. I got sent, like,
15 different pictures.

973
00:50:39,414 --> 00:50:41,291
It's just too awful.

974
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:42,960
So awful.

975
00:51:14,597 --> 00:51:15,723
Do you need me
for this?

976
00:51:15,723 --> 00:51:17,392
I've got it from here.

977
00:51:22,522 --> 00:51:24,357
So, lisa, what are
you doing for lunch?

978
00:51:32,574 --> 00:51:34,450
This is some strange...

979
00:51:51,718 --> 00:51:53,720
I know you're
in there, amber.

980
00:51:53,761 --> 00:51:55,430
Leave my friend alone.

981
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:56,764
You're messing
with the wrong girl.

982
00:51:56,764 --> 00:51:58,433
Selena, are you okay?

983
00:51:58,433 --> 00:52:00,602
<i>I wiget you.</i>

984
00:52:04,606 --> 00:52:06,357
Isn't it pathetic

985
00:52:06,399 --> 00:52:08,693
How some people can't handle
other people's success?

986
00:52:10,445 --> 00:52:12,572
Hey, lise, how was the big
party we weren't invited to?

987
00:52:12,614 --> 00:52:15,575
<i>As awesome as everyone
who was invited says?</i>

988
00:52:15,617 --> 00:52:17,452
Colin, come on.
She's still our friend.

989
00:52:17,452 --> 00:52:19,287
Is she, now?

990
00:52:19,287 --> 00:52:20,455
Excuse me, boys,

991
00:52:20,496 --> 00:52:22,540
But doesn't the virgin's
club meet during lunch

992
00:52:22,582 --> 00:52:23,625
To polish their
purity rings?

993
00:52:23,666 --> 00:52:27,462
Ohh, golly,
that is so rich.

994
00:52:27,462 --> 00:52:29,547
I'm gonna process that
and laugh at it later-

995
00:52:29,589 --> 00:52:32,383
You know, while you're out
getting your s. T.D. Shots.

996
00:52:32,425 --> 00:52:34,344
Guys, guys, guys.

997
00:52:34,385 --> 00:52:35,762
The party was
a last-minute thing.

998
00:52:35,803 --> 00:52:37,430
I meant to call.
I just-

999
00:52:37,472 --> 00:52:38,514
Only invited
the cool people.

1000
00:52:38,556 --> 00:52:40,433
'cause that's how
it works these days.

1001
00:52:40,475 --> 00:52:41,517
Colin, would you
give her a chance?

1002
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:43,686
Yeah, it was-

1003
00:52:43,728 --> 00:52:45,355
I was-

1004
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:47,565
It was a-
I just-

1005
00:52:47,607 --> 00:52:49,484
Got it. Thanks for
clearing that up.

1006
00:52:49,484 --> 00:52:51,486
So, listen, we've got to
finish this pig movie tonight.

1007
00:52:51,486 --> 00:52:52,779
So, are you there?

1008
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,781
Or is being cool your new
full-time gig these days?

1009
00:52:54,822 --> 00:52:56,532
Uh-

1010
00:53:00,536 --> 00:53:02,288
Sorry I missed
our lunch plans,

1011
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:04,499
But I was too busy
getting this.

1012
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,334
For me?

1013
00:53:06,376 --> 00:53:09,254
I had no other
creative way to, uh,

1014
00:53:09,295 --> 00:53:10,672
Ask you to prom
tomorrow night.

1015
00:53:10,672 --> 00:53:12,674
Ahem.

1016
00:53:12,715 --> 00:53:14,592
Oh. Yeah. Right.

1017
00:53:14,634 --> 00:53:17,387
Guys, uh...

1018
00:53:17,428 --> 00:53:19,389
Things have gotten really crazy
in the last couple of days,

1019
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:20,557
And I just-

1020
00:53:20,598 --> 00:53:21,724
I don't have time
for the movie right now.

1021
00:53:21,766 --> 00:53:24,394
Maybe on
the next one, okay?

1022
00:53:33,361 --> 00:53:34,696
I know that was
probably hard.

1023
00:53:34,696 --> 00:53:36,614
Skinny and runt boy liked
you when you were nothing.

1024
00:53:36,656 --> 00:53:38,616
And, believe me,
you were nothing.

1025
00:53:38,658 --> 00:53:40,618
But that was
a bold move.

1026
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,579
You know, I think you're
finally getting this.

1027
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,622
I'll make it up
to them after prom.

1028
00:53:44,664 --> 00:53:47,375
Maybe I'll to rub some of my
new popularity off on them,

1029
00:53:47,417 --> 00:53:48,585
And then they'll
understand.

1030
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:50,461
Lisa, hey.
Hey.

1031
00:53:50,503 --> 00:53:52,422
I know you got a lot of
new stuff going on,

1032
00:53:52,463 --> 00:53:53,590
And that's great.

1033
00:53:53,631 --> 00:53:56,301
And colin is-
is colin.

1034
00:53:56,342 --> 00:53:57,635
But we need you
on the movie.

1035
00:53:57,677 --> 00:53:59,721
We count on you.

1036
00:53:59,721 --> 00:54:01,639
I count on you.

1037
00:54:01,681 --> 00:54:04,392
I know, raj.

1038
00:54:04,434 --> 00:54:06,394
Maybe sometime
next week.

1039
00:54:06,394 --> 00:54:08,479
Mr. Kurkuri...

1040
00:54:08,521 --> 00:54:10,440
You were logged onto
computer terminal 14

1041
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:12,358
Yesterday after school,
right?

1042
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,693
You were also logged on
to that computer

1043
00:54:13,735 --> 00:54:15,278
Until this morning.

1044
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,529
I guess I forgot
to log off.

1045
00:54:16,571 --> 00:54:18,281
Oh, did you, now?

1046
00:54:18,323 --> 00:54:19,532
Did you know there
was a bogus email

1047
00:54:19,574 --> 00:54:21,492
Sent from that computer

1048
00:54:21,534 --> 00:54:24,287
About a social event held by
another student at this school?

1049
00:54:24,329 --> 00:54:26,372
That action is
a suspendable offense.

1050
00:54:26,414 --> 00:54:28,249
And it also
created damage

1051
00:54:28,291 --> 00:54:29,584
Which happened to
another student's house,

1052
00:54:29,584 --> 00:54:32,337
Which is something you'll have
to take up with the police.

1053
00:54:32,378 --> 00:54:34,297
But I was just
trying to buy a-

1054
00:54:34,339 --> 00:54:35,381
Do you know anything
about this?

1055
00:54:35,423 --> 00:54:36,507
No, nothing.

1056
00:54:37,759 --> 00:54:40,553
But I'm sure
it was just a goof.

1057
00:54:40,595 --> 00:54:43,264
A rather serious goof.

1058
00:54:43,306 --> 00:54:45,600
Come with me. We're gonna
talk to your parents.

1059
00:54:52,774 --> 00:54:54,776
Wow. Well...

1060
00:54:54,776 --> 00:54:56,778
That didn't work out
as I expected.

1061
00:54:58,488 --> 00:55:01,282
Uh, maybe we should try
to do something about it.

1062
00:55:03,368 --> 00:55:05,245
Raj will be fine.

1063
00:55:05,286 --> 00:55:08,289
I can't risk getting nailed for
this one day before the prom.

1064
00:55:08,289 --> 00:55:10,291
I'm doing this for
both of us, amber.

1065
00:55:10,333 --> 00:55:11,668
I need to be
elected queen,

1066
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:13,586
And you need to get
into heaven...

1067
00:55:13,628 --> 00:55:15,463
Which we wouldn't have to
worry about if you'd been nicer.

1068
00:55:15,505 --> 00:55:17,340
I can be nice.

1069
00:55:18,508 --> 00:55:20,426
Sometimes.

1070
00:55:20,468 --> 00:55:21,719
Maybe when
you were five,

1071
00:55:21,761 --> 00:55:23,638
But that girl's
long gone.

1072
00:55:23,638 --> 00:55:26,766
Ooh,
I like your jeans.

1073
00:55:48,538 --> 00:55:50,665
I was five.

1074
00:56:00,341 --> 00:56:01,718
I miss you.
I miss you.

1075
00:56:11,561 --> 00:56:13,563
Are you gonna
do this every day?

1076
00:56:13,605 --> 00:56:15,356
I don't know.

1077
00:56:15,398 --> 00:56:18,234
I need this form for
my science field trip.

1078
00:56:18,276 --> 00:56:19,527
You still haven't
signed it.

1079
00:56:19,527 --> 00:56:21,529
I didn't?
You didn't.

1080
00:56:24,532 --> 00:56:27,368
You're not looking
at her, mom.

1081
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:28,661
Look at her.

1082
00:56:28,703 --> 00:56:30,705
Mom, I'm trying to hold
this house together.

1083
00:56:30,705 --> 00:56:33,416
But I could use
a little help.

1084
00:56:34,542 --> 00:56:36,294
Do you even hear me?

1085
00:56:38,296 --> 00:56:39,631
Amber:
She's crying out for you.

1086
00:56:39,672 --> 00:56:42,550
This is it, mom.

1087
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:44,636
You want to
make it up to me,

1088
00:56:44,677 --> 00:56:46,638
Do something for her.

1089
00:56:48,431 --> 00:56:49,557
For clementine.

1090
00:56:54,312 --> 00:56:55,605
Mom!

1091
00:57:16,501 --> 00:57:19,462
I'm going to
be there for you.

1092
00:57:19,504 --> 00:57:21,422
I haven't been.

1093
00:57:23,466 --> 00:57:25,426
I'm gonna do better.

1094
00:57:28,721 --> 00:57:30,473
Better.

1095
00:57:32,392 --> 00:57:34,269
We'll all be bet-

1096
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:45,405
Mom? Clem?

1097
00:57:46,781 --> 00:57:48,449
What's going on?

1098
00:57:48,491 --> 00:57:50,743
We're-
we're putting an end

1099
00:57:50,785 --> 00:57:53,580
To all your evil ghost
plans, amber pollock.

1100
00:57:53,621 --> 00:57:55,415
Excuse me, do we
know each other?

1101
00:57:55,456 --> 00:57:57,709
We've only been in the
same class for nine years.

1102
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:01,379
Jeez. Really?

1103
00:58:01,421 --> 00:58:03,506
Did you change your
hair or something? No.

1104
00:58:03,548 --> 00:58:05,383
Listen, evil one...

1105
00:58:05,425 --> 00:58:08,469
We have you now, and you are never
gonna bother lisa sommers again.

1106
00:58:08,469 --> 00:58:09,596
You've totally
corrupted her!

1107
00:58:09,637 --> 00:58:11,598
I know, I know.

1108
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:13,516
Everything that was
bad about me-

1109
00:58:13,558 --> 00:58:15,435
The way I treated people
- it's her now,

1110
00:58:15,476 --> 00:58:17,270
And it's
all my fault.

1111
00:58:17,312 --> 00:58:19,314
What are you doing?

1112
00:58:19,314 --> 00:58:21,274
Is this a trick?

1113
00:58:22,609 --> 00:58:24,652
Please let me go.
I have to talk to lisa.

1114
00:58:24,694 --> 00:58:26,696
You think that after
what you've done,

1115
00:58:26,738 --> 00:58:29,449
We're just gonna
let you free to do more?

1116
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:31,326
Ha!
Selena...

1117
00:58:31,326 --> 00:58:32,577
I sense remorse.

1118
00:58:32,619 --> 00:58:36,497
And only a spirit can undo
what a spirit has done.

1119
00:58:36,497 --> 00:58:38,333
Thank you...

1120
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:40,501
Weird lady.

1121
00:58:40,501 --> 00:58:41,669
Well said.

1122
00:58:41,711 --> 00:58:44,255
Okay. Okay.

1123
00:58:44,297 --> 00:58:45,632
But you have to promise

1124
00:58:45,673 --> 00:58:48,259
To turn lisa back into the
nice girl she was before.

1125
00:58:48,301 --> 00:58:50,386
I really want to, but
it's not gonna be easy.

1126
00:58:50,428 --> 00:58:54,515
I mean, she's hot and
sexy and popular now,

1127
00:58:54,557 --> 00:58:57,310
And it's hard
to give up.

1128
00:58:57,352 --> 00:58:59,687
You wouldn't know.
Obviously.

1129
00:59:01,689 --> 00:59:03,691
Sorry. That slipped.

1130
00:59:06,277 --> 00:59:08,529
Oh, my gosh!
Of course!

1131
00:59:08,529 --> 00:59:10,240
You're that
mousy brainiac

1132
00:59:10,281 --> 00:59:12,367
Who skipped
a grade.

1133
00:59:12,367 --> 00:59:14,535
That's me. Smart...

1134
00:59:14,577 --> 00:59:16,412
And mousy.

1135
00:59:16,454 --> 00:59:18,706
Well, let me just say
you look a lot better now.

1136
00:59:18,706 --> 00:59:21,543
But that purple eye shadow
- not helping.

1137
00:59:21,543 --> 00:59:23,378
She's right about
the eye shadow.

1138
00:59:23,378 --> 00:59:26,464
Go! Save lisa.

1139
00:59:37,475 --> 00:59:40,228
Boy, it is great
in here.

1140
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:42,272
You've got the
candles over there.

1141
00:59:42,313 --> 00:59:44,649
We've got you and me
right here.

1142
00:59:44,691 --> 00:59:47,569
We've got my parents still
out of town till Sunday.

1143
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,281
Lisa, we need to talk.

1144
00:59:51,322 --> 00:59:52,407
Not now.
Okay.

1145
00:59:52,407 --> 00:59:54,617
No, no, you're fine.
Oh.

1146
00:59:54,659 --> 00:59:56,411
Seriously.

1147
00:59:56,411 --> 00:59:57,579
It's very important.

1148
00:59:57,579 --> 00:59:59,497
Now is not a time
for talking.

1149
00:59:59,539 --> 01:00:01,249
Oh, yeah.

1150
01:00:05,712 --> 01:00:08,256
Wow, that was nice.

1151
01:00:08,256 --> 01:00:10,300
I'm not leaving,
you know.

1152
01:00:14,721 --> 01:00:16,598
Is something wrong?

1153
01:00:16,598 --> 01:00:19,350
No, no, it's perfect.
You're perfect.

1154
01:00:19,392 --> 01:00:20,643
I can't stand what
I've done to you.

1155
01:00:20,685 --> 01:00:22,312
I've ruined
your life.

1156
01:00:22,353 --> 01:00:23,479
My life is fine,
thank you.

1157
01:00:23,521 --> 01:00:25,356
Mine, too.

1158
01:00:25,398 --> 01:00:27,567
You're self-centered
and shallow.

1159
01:00:27,609 --> 01:00:30,361
And it's all
because of me.

1160
01:00:30,403 --> 01:00:32,363
And you'll continue to keep
getting more self-centered

1161
01:00:32,405 --> 01:00:34,407
And more shallow
unless you stop right now.

1162
01:00:34,449 --> 01:00:36,618
I'm not stopping.
Me, neither.

1163
01:00:36,618 --> 01:00:39,287
You need to stop. I can't
let you become another me.

1164
01:00:39,329 --> 01:00:41,539
So, that's what this is?
You're jealous.

1165
01:00:41,581 --> 01:00:43,333
I've become a better you
than you were,

1166
01:00:43,374 --> 01:00:44,459
And you can't stand it.

1167
01:00:44,459 --> 01:00:45,585
Huh?
Not you.

1168
01:00:45,627 --> 01:00:47,462
You thought,
"let me work my magic

1169
01:00:47,503 --> 01:00:49,380
On the pathetic ugly duckling
and make her almost presentable. "

1170
01:00:49,422 --> 01:00:52,383
But I've surpassed you.
I'm better, hotter,

1171
01:00:52,425 --> 01:00:53,635
Smarter... Alive.

1172
01:00:56,596 --> 01:00:58,681
You know...

1173
01:00:58,723 --> 01:01:00,433
Lise...

1174
01:01:01,643 --> 01:01:03,561
You're acting
kind of crazy.

1175
01:01:06,314 --> 01:01:07,649
It's hot.

1176
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:09,359
Yeah.

1177
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,527
This is important.

1178
01:01:11,569 --> 01:01:13,321
If you become prom queen,

1179
01:01:13,363 --> 01:01:14,614
It will ruin you.

1180
01:01:14,656 --> 01:01:16,658
I need to be crazy
for just one more second.

1181
01:01:16,658 --> 01:01:18,284
Okay.

1182
01:01:19,619 --> 01:01:21,412
I'm going to become
prom queen,

1183
01:01:21,454 --> 01:01:22,664
And you're gonna go
to heaven.

1184
01:01:22,705 --> 01:01:24,499
It's a win-win.
Now get out of here.

1185
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:26,292
That's it.

1186
01:01:33,716 --> 01:01:35,510
Okay.

1187
01:01:35,552 --> 01:01:37,470
This is not hot
anymore.

1188
01:01:41,307 --> 01:01:42,475
Uh...

1189
01:01:48,356 --> 01:01:49,566
Don't worry about lisa.

1190
01:01:49,607 --> 01:01:51,484
I mean... I'm fine.

1191
01:01:51,526 --> 01:01:53,570
Nick, honey, we can't
have sex tonight.

1192
01:01:53,611 --> 01:01:55,321
Why don't you
just go home?

1193
01:01:56,573 --> 01:01:58,616
Whoa. Okay.

1194
01:01:58,658 --> 01:02:00,535
Um...

1195
01:02:00,535 --> 01:02:02,287
But can we do it
tomorrow night?

1196
01:02:02,328 --> 01:02:04,455
Sure. Whatever.
Right after prom.

1197
01:02:04,497 --> 01:02:05,665
Just go home.

1198
01:02:05,707 --> 01:02:07,333
Okay.

1199
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:08,626
But I'll be
warming up.

1200
01:02:08,668 --> 01:02:10,211
Mmm.

1201
01:02:10,253 --> 01:02:11,546
Okay.

1202
01:02:14,424 --> 01:02:17,218
I'm so sorry I did this
to you, lisa.

1203
01:02:35,528 --> 01:02:38,448
Where are we?
No place.

1204
01:02:38,489 --> 01:02:40,241
And too far
out of town

1205
01:02:40,283 --> 01:02:41,492
To get back
for the prom.

1206
01:02:41,534 --> 01:02:43,620
What? Why?

1207
01:02:43,661 --> 01:02:45,538
I'm doing this
for you, lisa.

1208
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:48,374
Wait, you're doing this
for you, too.

1209
01:02:48,416 --> 01:02:50,418
Don't you want
to go to heaven?

1210
01:02:51,669 --> 01:02:53,379
Not that much.

1211
01:02:59,761 --> 01:03:01,346
No! No! No!

1212
01:03:01,387 --> 01:03:03,223
Don't leave me here!

1213
01:03:15,276 --> 01:03:16,486
She's not stopping me.

1214
01:03:16,527 --> 01:03:18,488
I'm getting to that prom.

1215
01:03:18,529 --> 01:03:20,615
I have lots of friends.
I'm popular.

1216
01:03:20,657 --> 01:03:22,533
All I have to do
is call one of them,

1217
01:03:22,575 --> 01:03:25,453
And they'll be crawling all over
each other to come rescue me.

1218
01:04:01,406 --> 01:04:03,324
Does that phone work?

1219
01:04:04,659 --> 01:04:08,288
it does if you
got change.

1220
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:16,337
Nick, it's lisa.

1221
01:04:17,547 --> 01:04:20,300
Hey, crazy lady.
Hi, sweetie.

1222
01:04:20,341 --> 01:04:23,553
No time to explain, but I need you
to drive out oak springs, highway 7

1223
01:04:23,595 --> 01:04:24,637
<i>And pick me up.</i>

1224
01:04:24,679 --> 01:04:26,347
I'm surrounded
by dead things.

1225
01:04:26,389 --> 01:04:29,267
Oak springs. Damn,
that's a long way.

1226
01:04:29,309 --> 01:04:32,520
I know. And it's getting
late, so you have to start now.

1227
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:34,522
Oh, yeah, babe, jeez...

1228
01:04:34,564 --> 01:04:36,524
If only I could.

1229
01:04:36,524 --> 01:04:38,526
<i>But I don't want to die. Die?</i>

1230
01:04:38,526 --> 01:04:40,528
Yeah, I just entered
the nova star,

1231
01:04:40,528 --> 01:04:42,447
And if you quit
before you make overlord,

1232
01:04:42,488 --> 01:04:44,657
They cut off your head and you
have to start all over again.

1233
01:04:44,699 --> 01:04:46,326
What the hell
are you talking about?

1234
01:04:46,367 --> 01:04:50,246
The nova star.
Babe, this is big.

1235
01:04:50,288 --> 01:04:51,539
We have to be at prom
in six hours.

1236
01:04:51,581 --> 01:04:53,499
Okay, can we just
meet there?

1237
01:04:53,541 --> 01:04:55,460
You know what?
Never mind.

1238
01:04:55,501 --> 01:04:57,462
Wait, we're still having
sex afterwards, right?

1239
01:04:57,503 --> 01:04:58,671
Of course.

1240
01:05:00,381 --> 01:05:02,634
No! No, my head! Ohh!

1241
01:05:08,556 --> 01:05:11,309
Oh, thank god.
Paisley, it's lisa.

1242
01:05:11,351 --> 01:05:13,436
I need you to come
and get me in oak springs.

1243
01:05:13,478 --> 01:05:15,313
You're getting
your hair colored.

1244
01:05:15,355 --> 01:05:18,358
Of course.
Curls before girls.

1245
01:05:18,399 --> 01:05:19,567
Who doesn't live by that?

1246
01:05:19,609 --> 01:05:21,569
No, I'll just call dakota.

1247
01:05:21,611 --> 01:05:23,529
Oh, they're with you.

1248
01:05:23,571 --> 01:05:26,324
No, of course her curls
are important, too.

1249
01:05:28,409 --> 01:05:31,287
Far more important
than me being stranded

1250
01:05:31,329 --> 01:05:34,290
In the middle of nowhere.

1251
01:05:34,332 --> 01:05:37,335
Hi. It's lisa sommers.

1252
01:05:38,628 --> 01:05:41,589
Emily. It's lisa sommers.

1253
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:45,343
Listen, thank you for that invite
to go shopping and grab a latte.

1254
01:05:45,385 --> 01:05:47,470
But if you really
want to bond,

1255
01:05:47,512 --> 01:05:49,305
Don't you think spending four
or five hours in a car would be-

1256
01:05:49,347 --> 01:05:50,390
Hello?

1257
01:05:50,431 --> 01:05:52,267
Hola, isabelle.

1258
01:05:53,518 --> 01:05:55,436
Really?

1259
01:05:55,436 --> 01:05:57,438
Doesn't word
travel fast?

1260
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,440
Yeah, it's very funny.
Ha ha.

1261
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,443
Listen, I don't suppose
you'd be up for-

1262
01:06:02,485 --> 01:06:04,529
Please stop laughing.

1263
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:16,624
You're so damn slow.

1264
01:06:16,666 --> 01:06:19,544
Look, tarantino, we're a
little shorthanded today.

1265
01:06:19,586 --> 01:06:21,212
Give me a second.

1266
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:24,424
No personal
phone calls.

1267
01:06:24,465 --> 01:06:25,633
Bite me.

1268
01:06:25,675 --> 01:06:27,635
Hello?

1269
01:06:27,677 --> 01:06:29,596
Oh, thank god.
Lisa?

1270
01:06:29,637 --> 01:06:33,182
Okay, calm down.
It's okay.

1271
01:06:33,224 --> 01:06:34,642
We'll be there.

1272
01:06:34,642 --> 01:06:36,603
Oh!

1273
01:06:36,644 --> 01:06:40,315
Thank you guys so much
for coming to get me.

1274
01:06:40,315 --> 01:06:42,483
I thought I was popular,
but nobody would come.

1275
01:06:42,525 --> 01:06:44,277
They were all getting
their hair done.

1276
01:06:45,361 --> 01:06:46,529
I can't believe
how stupid I was.

1277
01:06:46,571 --> 01:06:48,323
I can't believe the way
I treated you guys.

1278
01:06:48,323 --> 01:06:50,491
I'm so sorry.
Especially you, raj.

1279
01:06:50,533 --> 01:06:52,493
You should be.
He got suspended,

1280
01:06:52,493 --> 01:06:54,329
And he has to perform
community service

1281
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:56,372
Fixing carlita's yard.

1282
01:06:56,414 --> 01:06:57,665
You're worse than amber.

1283
01:06:57,707 --> 01:06:59,626
You went from zero to
satan in, like, two days.

1284
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:03,546
That's what I've been telling
you. She was possessed.

1285
01:07:03,588 --> 01:07:07,342
Oh, right. The great
ghost bimbo from beyond.

1286
01:07:07,342 --> 01:07:09,510
I wasn't possessed.
This was all me.

1287
01:07:09,552 --> 01:07:11,262
See? No ghost.

1288
01:07:11,304 --> 01:07:13,181
No, there's a ghost.

1289
01:07:13,181 --> 01:07:15,642
There was. Or-
oh, my god. Amber.

1290
01:07:15,683 --> 01:07:17,393
I've got to save her.

1291
01:07:17,435 --> 01:07:18,645
You're about
a week late, remember?

1292
01:07:18,686 --> 01:07:21,231
"give me that crown!"
zzzzzt! "aaaah!"

1293
01:07:21,272 --> 01:07:24,651
Colin, I need you to get
me to the prom right now.

1294
01:07:27,362 --> 01:07:28,696
Come on!

1295
01:07:31,407 --> 01:07:35,662
Hello?

1296
01:07:35,703 --> 01:07:38,373
Mr. Purgatory man?

1297
01:07:38,414 --> 01:07:39,541
Miss pollock.

1298
01:07:41,584 --> 01:07:43,419
The prom isn't
till this evening.

1299
01:07:43,461 --> 01:07:45,547
We can't send you upstairs
until it's official.

1300
01:07:45,588 --> 01:07:48,550
I'm not gonna be
going upstairs.

1301
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:51,553
Really? I was getting
such positive reports.

1302
01:07:51,553 --> 01:07:53,680
It didn't work out.

1303
01:07:53,721 --> 01:07:55,473
I failed.

1304
01:07:55,515 --> 01:07:59,227
So, send me,
I guess... Down?

1305
01:07:59,269 --> 01:08:00,603
Are you sure
about this?

1306
01:08:00,645 --> 01:08:02,480
I think you could
pull this off.

1307
01:08:02,522 --> 01:08:05,316
I'm sure.

1308
01:08:06,568 --> 01:08:08,444
Okie-dokie.

1309
01:08:13,366 --> 01:08:15,285
Your ride is here.

1310
01:08:31,926 --> 01:08:34,220
I thought all the fun
people were going to hell.

1311
01:08:35,847 --> 01:08:37,932
A knife fight?
Two dead?

1312
01:08:37,974 --> 01:08:39,934
That's kindergarten
stuff.

1313
01:08:39,976 --> 01:08:42,937
I sold high-risk mortgages
to homeless people,

1314
01:08:42,979 --> 01:08:44,939
Only so I could repo
their new abodes

1315
01:08:44,939 --> 01:08:46,941
And make them
homeless again.

1316
01:08:46,983 --> 01:08:49,110
What did you do,
blondie?

1317
01:08:49,152 --> 01:08:50,904
I was...

1318
01:08:50,945 --> 01:08:52,113
Mean to everyone.

1319
01:08:52,155 --> 01:08:54,866
Hmm.

1320
01:08:54,908 --> 01:08:57,035
Rookie.

1321
01:09:16,971 --> 01:09:18,806
Exquisite. Fabulous.

1322
01:09:18,848 --> 01:09:21,100
No drinking.
Arrive alive.

1323
01:09:21,142 --> 01:09:24,187
Miss sommers... What
happened to your shoes?

1324
01:09:24,229 --> 01:09:27,106
Oh. Oh.

1325
01:09:27,148 --> 01:09:29,192
Nothing. It-
it's a thing I'm trying.

1326
01:09:29,234 --> 01:09:31,110
Well, you're certainly
cutting it close.

1327
01:09:31,152 --> 01:09:32,987
They're about to start
voting. Go check it.

1328
01:09:32,987 --> 01:09:35,156
Thank god. Wait,
I need to talk to you.

1329
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:37,992
Raj is innocent. I was the
one who sent out the emails

1330
01:09:38,034 --> 01:09:40,161
About carlita's party.
Okay, bye.

1331
01:09:40,161 --> 01:09:42,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
little missy.

1332
01:09:42,121 --> 01:09:44,958
If that's the case, you're
suspended immediately,

1333
01:09:44,999 --> 01:09:46,793
And ineligible
from prom queen.

1334
01:09:46,834 --> 01:09:48,169
No, you have
to let me run.

1335
01:09:48,211 --> 01:09:50,171
Please,
it's so important.

1336
01:09:50,213 --> 01:09:52,966
Hey, hey, hey.

1337
01:09:53,007 --> 01:09:55,009
No underwear showing!

1338
01:09:55,009 --> 01:09:56,844
Where'd she-

1339
01:09:56,886 --> 01:09:58,054
What's up?

1340
01:09:58,096 --> 01:10:00,014
Did you guys get dressed
in the dark?

1341
01:10:00,014 --> 01:10:01,891
Whatever happened
to tuxedos?

1342
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:07,146
<i>Woman over speaker:
Attention life losers-</i>

1343
01:10:07,188 --> 01:10:10,149
<i>Please keep your hands
and feet inside the shuttle</i>

1344
01:10:10,191 --> 01:10:12,193
<i>At all times.</i>

1345
01:10:12,193 --> 01:10:15,947
<i>In a moment, we'll be entering
the outer reaches of hell.</i>

1346
01:10:15,989 --> 01:10:17,949
<i>As the temperature rises,</i>

1347
01:10:17,991 --> 01:10:20,868
<i>Please refrain from
screaming and pleading.</i>

1348
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:22,203
<i>Trust us-</i>

1349
01:10:22,245 --> 01:10:25,123
<i>We've heard it all.</i>

1350
01:10:30,211 --> 01:10:32,046
Can I get your attention,
everybody?

1351
01:10:32,046 --> 01:10:33,339
Can I get your attention
real quick?

1352
01:10:35,216 --> 01:10:38,261
Hello. All right.

1353
01:10:38,303 --> 01:10:40,221
Let me just remind everyone

1354
01:10:40,221 --> 01:10:44,142
That lisa sommers is no longer
eligible as a candidate.

1355
01:10:44,183 --> 01:10:46,269
So, that leaves...

1356
01:10:46,311 --> 01:10:48,313
Well, just carlita cache.

1357
01:10:48,354 --> 01:10:51,900
All right, well, good luck...
Everybody!

1358
01:10:51,941 --> 01:10:54,068
I hate my life.

1359
01:10:58,907 --> 01:11:00,033
God, carlita...

1360
01:11:00,074 --> 01:11:01,159
Everyone is voting
for you.

1361
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,869
They sure are.

1362
01:11:08,041 --> 01:11:09,250
Thanks, girls.

1363
01:11:09,292 --> 01:11:11,127
Would you get me
some punch?

1364
01:11:11,169 --> 01:11:13,213
Yes.
No, me!

1365
01:11:16,299 --> 01:11:18,885
Everybody, could I-

1366
01:11:18,927 --> 01:11:21,888
Excuse me, everybody?
Can I-

1367
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:23,306
Can I get your
attention, please?

1368
01:11:28,228 --> 01:11:30,939
Please let me do this.

1369
01:11:33,107 --> 01:11:35,818
What is she doing? She
said she had an idea.

1370
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:38,238
Something that's going
to fix everything.

1371
01:11:41,950 --> 01:11:44,202
First of all...

1372
01:11:44,244 --> 01:11:46,871
I was the one who sabotaged
carlita's party.

1373
01:11:46,913 --> 01:11:49,123
I knew it.
Totally knew it.

1374
01:11:49,165 --> 01:11:51,960
I was the one who
sent those emails,

1375
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,294
Not my
good friend raj.

1376
01:11:53,336 --> 01:11:56,297
I was trying to
take carlita down.

1377
01:11:58,091 --> 01:12:00,301
You see...
I was so tired

1378
01:12:00,343 --> 01:12:03,846
Of not being seen,

1379
01:12:03,888 --> 01:12:05,181
That when I finally
got the chance,

1380
01:12:05,223 --> 01:12:07,976
I was willing to do
anything to be noticed,

1381
01:12:08,017 --> 01:12:09,811
To feel special.

1382
01:12:11,062 --> 01:12:13,106
I thought being popular
would make everything better,

1383
01:12:13,147 --> 01:12:14,899
But it didn't.

1384
01:12:14,941 --> 01:12:16,276
You know what else
I found out?

1385
01:12:16,317 --> 01:12:18,903
Being popular does not
mean everybody likes you.

1386
01:12:18,945 --> 01:12:20,238
This is dangerous.

1387
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,156
She's tampering with
the fundamental dynamics

1388
01:12:22,156 --> 01:12:24,033
Of the high school
universe.

1389
01:12:27,954 --> 01:12:29,998
Be honest.

1390
01:12:29,998 --> 01:12:33,167
How many of you have ever
felt the way I did?

1391
01:12:33,209 --> 01:12:35,295
How many of you walk
into this school every day

1392
01:12:35,336 --> 01:12:37,338
And wonder if anyone
really cares?

1393
01:12:39,215 --> 01:12:40,967
How many of you have worried

1394
01:12:41,009 --> 01:12:42,260
About whether your clothes
are cool enough,

1395
01:12:42,302 --> 01:12:44,220
Or if you're listening
to the right music?

1396
01:12:46,055 --> 01:12:47,849
Or how many of you
have been hurt

1397
01:12:47,849 --> 01:12:50,101
When you find out about a party
you were never invited to?

1398
01:12:52,312 --> 01:12:55,857
And how many of you have done
something really stupid and insensitive

1399
01:12:55,857 --> 01:12:57,859
Just to be part of
the cool crowd?

1400
01:13:02,113 --> 01:13:04,824
What about this?

1401
01:13:04,866 --> 01:13:07,869
What if the cool crowd
was all of us?

1402
01:13:07,869 --> 01:13:09,037
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1403
01:13:09,078 --> 01:13:11,873
What if going to school
wasn't a competition?

1404
01:13:11,915 --> 01:13:13,166
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1405
01:13:13,208 --> 01:13:16,169
What if we all just said,
"screw this!"

1406
01:13:18,046 --> 01:13:19,839
Screw having a contest

1407
01:13:19,881 --> 01:13:21,174
That draws attention
to someone

1408
01:13:21,216 --> 01:13:22,884
Who clearly
doesn't need it.

1409
01:13:22,926 --> 01:13:26,054
Screw the idea that
you can't look around

1410
01:13:26,095 --> 01:13:27,889
At everybody in this room

1411
01:13:27,931 --> 01:13:31,976
And believe that you couldn't
be friends with any of them.

1412
01:13:32,018 --> 01:13:34,270
This year, let's make
tonight mean something.

1413
01:13:36,856 --> 01:13:38,983
Let's shower that attention on
somebody who's just a good person,

1414
01:13:39,025 --> 01:13:41,236
Who's a real friend,

1415
01:13:41,277 --> 01:13:43,154
Somebody who believes
the best of everybody.

1416
01:13:43,196 --> 01:13:45,031
Yeah!

1417
01:13:47,075 --> 01:13:49,077
Let's vote for raj kurkuri.

1418
01:13:49,077 --> 01:13:51,204
who?!

1419
01:13:51,246 --> 01:13:52,914
Raj!

1420
01:13:52,956 --> 01:13:55,875
"who?" right.
Exactly my point.

1421
01:13:55,917 --> 01:13:57,252
After tonight,
let's make sure

1422
01:13:57,252 --> 01:13:59,087
We never ask that again.

1423
01:14:00,964 --> 01:14:02,131
Who is it?
Sure.

1424
01:14:04,175 --> 01:14:05,927
Raj! Raj!

1425
01:14:05,927 --> 01:14:08,930
Raj! Raj! Raj!

1426
01:14:08,972 --> 01:14:13,101
Raj! Raj! Raj!

1427
01:14:13,142 --> 01:14:14,811
Raj! Raj!

1428
01:14:14,852 --> 01:14:16,896
You know what?
Forget about counting ballots.

1429
01:14:16,938 --> 01:14:18,856
Let's vote right now.

1430
01:14:18,898 --> 01:14:20,984
Everybody who's for raj,
raise your hand.

1431
01:15:21,127 --> 01:15:24,172
<i>The white-hot plasma
outside the window</i>

1432
01:15:24,172 --> 01:15:27,008
<i>Indicates we are nearing
our final destination,</i>

1433
01:15:27,008 --> 01:15:29,844
<i>So please fasten
your seat belts.</i>

1434
01:15:29,844 --> 01:15:32,222
<i>Just joking.
You're already dead.</i>

1435
01:15:32,263 --> 01:15:36,017
<i>In order to make your arrival
even more unpleasant,</i>

1436
01:15:36,017 --> 01:15:39,187
<i>The man downstairs would like you
to please deposit your teeth and hair</i>

1437
01:15:39,187 --> 01:15:42,232
<i>Into the small bin
provided at the exit.</i>

1438
01:15:42,273 --> 01:15:44,317
<i>Then please move on
to the next line,</i>

1439
01:15:44,359 --> 01:15:46,194
Where a hot metal tube

1440
01:15:46,236 --> 01:15:49,322
<i>Will drop you into an
endless lake of molten lava.</i>

1441
01:15:55,245 --> 01:15:56,871
Amber, dear.

1442
01:15:56,871 --> 01:15:58,957
The oddest thing
just happened.

1443
01:15:58,998 --> 01:16:00,875
The least popular person
in your high school

1444
01:16:00,917 --> 01:16:03,169
Was just elected
prom king.

1445
01:16:03,211 --> 01:16:05,255
King?

1446
01:16:05,296 --> 01:16:07,882
What can I say?
It's a modern world.

1447
01:16:07,882 --> 01:16:09,175
You know
what this means?

1448
01:16:10,885 --> 01:16:13,137
Heaven?
Eventually.

1449
01:16:13,179 --> 01:16:17,267
But right now, scads
and scads more paperwork.

1450
01:16:17,308 --> 01:16:19,269
So, you're
coming with me.

1451
01:16:24,107 --> 01:16:26,067
And, to the rest
of you...

1452
01:16:26,109 --> 01:16:27,193
Bye-bye.

1453
01:16:38,204 --> 01:16:40,999
Hey!
Hey!

1454
01:16:46,129 --> 01:16:47,255
Just you in there?

1455
01:16:47,297 --> 01:16:49,257
Just me.

1456
01:16:49,299 --> 01:16:51,885
Hey, this is
great and all,

1457
01:16:51,926 --> 01:16:54,053
But we've got a lot of work to
do on the movie, starting tonight.

1458
01:16:57,223 --> 01:17:00,101
Or tomorrow.
Tomorrow's good.

1459
01:17:07,817 --> 01:17:09,235
Give me a sec.

1460
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:18,953
The sweet dweeb
got the crown.

1461
01:17:18,995 --> 01:17:20,205
Not bad.

1462
01:17:20,246 --> 01:17:22,165
I like your gown.

1463
01:17:25,126 --> 01:17:27,212
They told me
it comes with wings.

1464
01:17:27,253 --> 01:17:29,964
But I'm not ready
to accessorize.

1465
01:17:34,969 --> 01:17:38,890
So...

1466
01:17:40,934 --> 01:17:42,852
Hey, give me a minute,
would you?

1467
01:17:44,187 --> 01:17:45,939
Thank you.

1468
01:17:47,190 --> 01:17:49,192
Listen...

1469
01:17:49,234 --> 01:17:51,986
I think you're
a great person,

1470
01:17:51,986 --> 01:17:54,239
And I want you
to have a great life.

1471
01:17:56,157 --> 01:17:58,076
And I was telling you
the truth.

1472
01:17:58,117 --> 01:17:59,953
A little confidence
doesn't hurt.

1473
01:18:01,162 --> 01:18:05,208
Now, don't become an amber,
but, you know...

1474
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:06,960
Somewhere
in the middle.

1475
01:18:07,001 --> 01:18:09,003
Yeah.

1476
01:18:09,045 --> 01:18:11,172
Hey, you're gonna be
a huge hit in college.

1477
01:18:12,173 --> 01:18:14,008
I know it.

1478
01:18:14,008 --> 01:18:15,802
Actually, I peaked.

1479
01:18:18,096 --> 01:18:20,181
I'd hug you, but I'd
go right through-

1480
01:18:27,897 --> 01:18:30,316
Thank you... For her.

1481
01:18:38,032 --> 01:18:39,200
Oh, my god.

1482
01:18:39,242 --> 01:18:41,202
Come on, turn around.
Slowly.

1483
01:18:41,244 --> 01:18:44,122
Zac efron mall boy-
he found you.

1484
01:18:48,209 --> 01:18:51,212
Oh, my god.
What do I do?

1485
01:18:51,212 --> 01:18:52,964
You know what to do.

1486
01:18:54,215 --> 01:18:56,050
I do.

1487
01:18:58,219 --> 01:19:00,138
Now go.

1488
01:19:05,226 --> 01:19:07,061
I'll be looking
over you.

1489
01:19:18,907 --> 01:19:22,035
I have been to seven proms
tonight looking for you.

1490
01:19:22,076 --> 01:19:23,161
Heh.

1491
01:19:23,203 --> 01:19:25,246
Man, you are...

1492
01:19:25,246 --> 01:19:27,248
So much hotter
than what I remember.

1493
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:29,167
Oh, I'm sorry. Um...

1494
01:19:29,209 --> 01:19:30,877
I don't want to
scare you again.

1495
01:19:30,919 --> 01:19:33,963
That scared girl is...

1496
01:19:34,005 --> 01:19:35,089
Gone.

1497
01:19:36,257 --> 01:19:37,800
Since you came
all this way,

1498
01:19:37,842 --> 01:19:38,927
You want to dance
or something?

1499
01:19:38,968 --> 01:19:40,178
Oh, god, yes.

1500
01:19:48,102 --> 01:19:50,813
So, um... Should I
say anything

1501
01:19:50,855 --> 01:19:52,190
About the really hot
prom outfit you've got on,

1502
01:19:52,232 --> 01:19:53,942
Or do I just continue
to ignore it?

1503
01:19:53,942 --> 01:19:55,276
Ignore it.

1504
01:19:55,318 --> 01:19:57,946
you got it.

1505
01:19:57,987 --> 01:19:59,948
All right, ashley high,
let's kick it up!

1506
01:20:05,954 --> 01:20:08,122
<i>And so, for
one brief, shining moment,</i>

1507
01:20:08,164 --> 01:20:10,959
<i>The high school universe
was upended,</i>

1508
01:20:10,959 --> 01:20:14,003
<i>And the least of them
became the best of them.</i>

1509
01:20:14,045 --> 01:20:15,296
<i>And for the rest of
the evening,</i>

1510
01:20:15,338 --> 01:20:17,131
<i>The walls came down.</i>

1511
01:20:17,173 --> 01:20:18,216
Oh!

1512
01:20:19,884 --> 01:20:20,969
Whoa!

1513
01:20:28,977 --> 01:20:30,270
This is wrong!

1514
01:20:30,311 --> 01:20:31,980
This mixing-

1515
01:20:32,021 --> 01:20:33,982
It's completely wrong!

1516
01:20:34,023 --> 01:20:35,066
It's against nature!

1517
01:20:35,108 --> 01:20:37,026
Stop playing now!

1518
01:20:40,154 --> 01:20:43,116
Uhh! I'm shutting
this whole thing down!

1519
01:20:49,372 --> 01:20:51,332
<i>Oh, lucky me.</i>

1520
01:20:51,932 --> 01:20:53,809
Here we go again.

1521
01:20:53,834 --> 01:20:56,934
