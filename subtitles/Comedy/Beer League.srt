1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,697
And so DeVanzo stands in.

2
00:00:19,768 --> 00:00:21,897
Six foot first baseman
out of Pawtucket.

3
00:00:22,403 --> 00:00:23,839
fine form on this fellow.

4
00:00:24,873 --> 00:00:26,342
Shot down the line.

5
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:28,778
That's a frozen rope.

6
00:00:28,944 --> 00:00:30,504
Base hit in anybody's league.

7
00:00:33,716 --> 00:00:38,054
And here's Captain Jeter steps up
to the plate to his usual hip-hop music.

8
00:00:40,822 --> 00:00:43,056
And look at the triceps
on this youngster.

9
00:00:43,226 --> 00:00:46,130
Someone was busy in the Nautilus room
during the off-season.

10
00:00:46,195 --> 00:00:48,722
He'll give the fans a treat
and do a little flexing.

11
00:00:48,898 --> 00:00:51,198
That's right. There're a couple
of actresses on the front row...

12
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:53,760
that are going out of their minds
right about now.

13
00:00:55,104 --> 00:00:55,901
Yeah!

14
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:58,238
And sometimes he'll get in there
and just give the fans a treat...

15
00:00:58,307 --> 00:01:02,111
and show them
some of the finer points of hitting.

16
00:01:03,512 --> 00:01:04,445
Fuck!

17
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:07,077
Absolute pe_ect ten
on this fellow.

18
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,309
Quite a specimen.

19
00:01:08,585 --> 00:01:13,618
385 hitter, 23 ding-dongs.
He's driven in 162 runs.

20
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,389
He's 30 sit-ups away from the body
of a young Willie Mays!

21
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,362
And that's a single
up in the middle.

22
00:01:18,428 --> 00:01:20,955
Looked more like a double
play to me, you fat fuck.

23
00:01:21,231 --> 00:01:22,597
What the fuck did you say?

24
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,102
I said softball's
for girls and faggots...

25
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,762
and girl faggots like you.

26
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:27,861
You piece of shit!

27
00:01:29,372 --> 00:01:30,306
Mom!

28
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:33,312
the fat fuck new door
is chasing me again!

29
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,379
Anybody had seen my softball hat?

30
00:01:45,823 --> 00:01:47,086
- Michael?
- Yeah.

31
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:50,254
- Did you look at these cakes, yet?
- Yeah, yeah. I like that one.

32
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:53,095
Hey, Marie, Marie, get the hat!
Gina, get the hat!

33
00:01:53,163 --> 00:01:54,894
- You didn't even look?
- Marie, that's not funny!

34
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:57,128
Okay, you know what?
I'm not being a bitch here.

35
00:01:57,234 --> 00:01:59,033
You're missing
Marie's recital tonight...

36
00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:02,508
and I said we could wait for after the
softball season to go on our honeymoon.

37
00:02:02,573 --> 00:02:05,477
I even let you pick
your scumbag friend Artie as best man.

38
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:07,672
Sweetheart, listen,
it's the first game of the season.

39
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:09,179
I just don't want to be late,
alright?

40
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:11,274
I'm with you on the cake.
So I'll look at them later.

41
00:02:11,682 --> 00:02:13,276
You know,
I was gonna surprise you...

42
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:15,287
by making your little
plastic man on the cake...

43
00:02:15,353 --> 00:02:16,912
a Derek Jeter action figure.

44
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,580
But now, no.

45
00:02:18,656 --> 00:02:21,628
I'm making you one of those
Puerto Ricans from the fucking Mets.

46
00:02:22,627 --> 00:02:24,290
Don't even joke like that, Gina!

47
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:40,503
- I'm coming back tomorrow for tanning.
- You better.

48
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:49,687
Hey! Mark Vicki Galliotta
down as paid up for this month.

49
00:02:52,991 --> 00:02:55,656
And another dumb slut
gets herpes.

50
00:03:10,142 --> 00:03:14,014
Hey! I don't want any of you Italians
drinking out of my water bottle!

51
00:03:14,813 --> 00:03:15,838
Damn Wops.

52
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:20,686
- Come on, Maz, let's warm up already.
- Don't mess with my pre-game ritual.

53
00:03:20,953 --> 00:03:23,287
Putting on mascara
is not a pre-game ritual.

54
00:03:23,355 --> 00:03:25,450
- Let's go!
- Stop busting my chops, I'm coming.

55
00:03:26,492 --> 00:03:27,460
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

56
00:03:27,526 --> 00:03:28,790
What's up, brother?
Check it out.

57
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:31,393
- My new Italiano mitt.
- That's cool, Alfonse.

58
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:34,196
How much of a Guido
can you possibly be?

59
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:36,498
Fuck you, Johnny.
I'll see you out there.

60
00:03:36,736 --> 00:03:38,638
- What's up?
- Starting earlier this year?

61
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:41,232
Ready for the big day,
opening day, big game?

62
00:03:41,306 --> 00:03:43,574
Maz, we stink evey year.
This is not a big game.

63
00:03:43,643 --> 00:03:45,340
- Yes, it is.
- It's not a big game.

64
00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:47,939
Yes, it is. I blew off
my daughter's ballet recital for this.

65
00:03:48,014 --> 00:03:49,643
I've seen your daughter dance.
She sucks.

66
00:03:49,716 --> 00:03:50,911
- No, she doesn't.
- Yeah, she does.

67
00:03:50,983 --> 00:03:53,614
- Which one, ballet or tap?
- It all sucks.

68
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:56,054
- What's up, boys?
- What's up, Manganelli?

69
00:03:56,123 --> 00:03:57,853
So, Maz, how's the wedding coming?
Are you nervous?

70
00:03:57,923 --> 00:04:00,919
I'm doing okay.
Gina's freaking out a little, but...

71
00:04:00,993 --> 00:04:04,364
My cousin is a good kid,
but she can be a real ball-breaker.

72
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,490
What are you going to do?

73
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:07,759
All right, listen up.

74
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:11,866
Anybody who doesn't do a pre-game shout
with me right now is a fucking pussy.

75
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:13,498
Jerk off!

76
00:04:15,075 --> 00:04:17,307
Did this jerk off
just call me a jerk off?

77
00:04:17,377 --> 00:04:20,144
Come on, let's not ruin another game
with a big fight, all right?

78
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:21,374
Dave!

79
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:22,575
Arto.

80
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,073
Fellows.

81
00:04:24,951 --> 00:04:26,979
Dad, I'm thirsty.
Can I have some?

82
00:04:27,054 --> 00:04:29,719
No. Go steal that little kid's soda.

83
00:04:30,457 --> 00:04:33,828
Bro, look at yourself.
You're an unemployed drunk...

84
00:04:33,894 --> 00:04:37,334
you play softball in corduroy
and you still live with your mother.

85
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:40,335
You shave your body hair,
wear Speedos down the short...

86
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:42,234
and root for the Dallas Cowboys.

87
00:04:42,303 --> 00:04:44,170
Hey, that's America's team,
asshole.

88
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:46,070
Not in Jersey, asshole.

89
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,110
We grew up fifteen minutes
from Giant Stadium...

90
00:04:48,175 --> 00:04:49,838
you're a fucking Cowboys' fan?

91
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:50,935
You're iust iealous.

92
00:04:51,312 --> 00:04:54,045
My softball team won this league
for years in a row...

93
00:04:54,115 --> 00:04:55,549
going on five.

94
00:04:56,117 --> 00:04:58,519
This year you're not getting
that trophy.

95
00:04:58,586 --> 00:05:00,488
No?
Who's going to stop me, you?

96
00:05:02,256 --> 00:05:05,285
In high school,
I was the best baseball player.

97
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:06,588
You were second best.

98
00:05:06,861 --> 00:05:09,525
I was the best football player.
You were second best.

99
00:05:09,597 --> 00:05:11,294
And, bro, the chicks I got...

100
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:12,857
were way out of your league.

101
00:05:12,934 --> 00:05:14,870
I did fine.
You fucked skanks.

102
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:15,961
Skanks?

103
00:05:16,037 --> 00:05:18,439
You're looking at the first guy
to bang Jan Martucci.

104
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:19,998
Wow, definitely not a skank.

105
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:21,969
I'm sory.

106
00:05:22,644 --> 00:05:24,841
- Lisa Riccio.
- Monica Nelson.

107
00:05:24,913 --> 00:05:27,407
- Danielle Battaglia.
- Marisa Salvanto.

108
00:05:27,482 --> 00:05:29,315
- Karen Dever.
- Tina Gardner.

109
00:05:29,384 --> 00:05:31,581
- Karen Dever.
- Pinky Calabr...

110
00:05:31,653 --> 00:05:33,247
You iust said Karen Dever.

111
00:05:33,322 --> 00:05:34,847
Well, we did more than once.

112
00:05:34,923 --> 00:05:37,087
Okay, I guess
we're done here, bro.

113
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:40,131
Because you're out of names,
and I got like fifty more.

114
00:05:40,195 --> 00:05:42,028
I see you on the field, loser.

115
00:05:42,097 --> 00:05:44,693
Yeah, go ahead.
Run away, jerk off.

116
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:45,825
Run away!

117
00:05:49,171 --> 00:05:50,070
Bring it in!

118
00:05:50,973 --> 00:05:53,500
Now coming to bat
is Artie DeVanzo.

119
00:05:53,575 --> 00:05:56,308
Last season was a fine one
for DeVanzo, we alI know that.

120
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:59,214
- Come on, Artie.
- He batted. 420 with 45 RBls.

121
00:05:59,281 --> 00:06:01,183
- Come on, Artie.
- Batter up!

122
00:06:01,549 --> 00:06:03,042
He entgrs tDday's game...

123
00:06:03,118 --> 00:06:05,418
with a bl_ alcohol content
of.16.

124
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:08,949
If you kids are scoring at home, that's
an impressive mice the legal limit.

125
00:06:09,024 --> 00:06:10,926
- Let's get it go, buddy!
- The DeVanzo shift!

126
00:06:10,993 --> 00:06:12,291
What do you say, Art?

127
00:06:12,361 --> 00:06:15,094
- Let's go, Artie.
- Let's go, Arto. Let's go!

128
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:16,724
What's this shit, Manganelli?

129
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:18,530
It's my new defense strategy.

130
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:22,835
All right side is open for you, Artie.
Go for it, bro.

131
00:06:23,071 --> 00:06:24,769
All right, go the other way
with it, Artie.

132
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,605
He's tying to fool you,
don't be stupid. Come on!

133
00:06:26,676 --> 00:06:28,441
- Come on, Artie!
- Let's go, baby!

134
00:06:28,511 --> 00:06:29,444
Come on now!

135
00:06:31,147 --> 00:06:32,172
Shit!

136
00:06:32,248 --> 00:06:33,910
So, of course, he pulls it.

137
00:06:34,817 --> 00:06:36,947
Hey, the shift works good,
Manganelli.

138
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,718
- Run, Artie, run!
- Artie, run! Run, man!

139
00:06:39,788 --> 00:06:42,352
- Come on, Artie!
- Get it over there!

140
00:06:42,859 --> 00:06:43,792
Out!

141
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,521
Nice hustle, Artie.

142
00:06:46,095 --> 00:06:48,623
You're a fat fucking disgrace!

143
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,225
He's a fat guy.

144
00:06:53,102 --> 00:06:55,198
Come on, Dirt.
Start it off, kid. Come on now.

145
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:56,239
All right, Dirt.
Come on, Dirt.

146
00:06:56,305 --> 00:06:57,639
Lay it in there, baby.
Come on, Dirt. Let's go!

147
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,678
What do you say, Dirt?
You character.

148
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,470
All right, Dirt.
Come on now.

149
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:04,608
- Shit!
- Jesus Christ!

150
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:07,448
You disappoint me as much as my kids
for Christ's sake.

151
00:07:10,654 --> 00:07:12,020
Okay, here we go!

152
00:07:12,088 --> 00:07:13,523
Here we go, coming home.

153
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,853
Come on, get it in.
Get it in!

154
00:07:14,925 --> 00:07:16,360
Hit the cut-off man!

155
00:07:17,194 --> 00:07:18,127
Yeah!

156
00:07:18,628 --> 00:07:19,756
Cut-off man!

157
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,560
Cut-off man!

158
00:07:21,631 --> 00:07:22,657
Learn to love him.

159
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:26,070
- You're killing us!
- The hell are you doing?

160
00:07:26,136 --> 00:07:29,838
One second! I'm having a smoke.
What's up your ass?

161
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:33,443
- I got it!
- Shit.

162
00:07:33,844 --> 00:07:35,108
Cocky prick!

163
00:07:37,682 --> 00:07:38,672
He's tagging!

164
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:40,575
No, Dave, don't go!

165
00:07:40,685 --> 00:07:41,618
Hold on!

166
00:07:41,686 --> 00:07:42,654
Come on!

167
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:45,655
Nice play.

168
00:07:45,723 --> 00:07:46,656
- Good job.
- You're out.

169
00:07:46,724 --> 00:07:47,692
Good iob.

170
00:07:47,992 --> 00:07:50,189
Come on, let's see it, Dirt.
Let's see it, Dirt.

171
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,530
Fuck, no pitch.

172
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:55,194
Hey, Tim, I want to let you know...

173
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,330
I've done a lot of thinking about
that talk we had last year.

174
00:07:58,703 --> 00:08:00,035
I don't even know if you remember.

175
00:08:00,805 --> 00:08:03,538
I remember. When I overheard
you telling that joke at the bar, right?

176
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,701
Exactly.

177
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:05,937
You know,
if we weren't good friends...

178
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,536
I would've handled that
quite differently, right?

179
00:08:07,678 --> 00:08:10,845
Hey, look, just so you know,
I don't even use the ''N'' word anymore.

180
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:14,582
Like just now, instead of saying the
actual word, I just say the ''N'' word.

181
00:08:15,386 --> 00:08:17,550
I appreciate that, Artie.
That's a good start.

182
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,612
Good for you, man.

183
00:08:18,824 --> 00:08:20,520
That's okay, Dave.
Keep swinging.

184
00:08:20,592 --> 00:08:22,961
As a matter of fact,
listen how I tell this joke now.

185
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:25,089
A priest, a Rabin and a ''N'' word
walk into a bar...

186
00:08:25,163 --> 00:08:27,224
All right, hold up, hold up,
hold up!

187
00:08:28,934 --> 00:08:30,493
Strike three, you're out!

188
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:32,298
- That was...
- That's three.

189
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:35,073
Come on!
Let's get these guy!

190
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,611
Let's get these punk!
He's nothing!

191
00:08:37,676 --> 00:08:39,008
He's an asshole!

192
00:08:39,077 --> 00:08:41,640
A cocksucker!
He's a total piece of shit!

193
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,180
You shut up, fatso.

194
00:08:43,516 --> 00:08:47,422
- Hey, watch the name-calling!
- Come on, Dirt. Let's go now!

195
00:08:48,787 --> 00:08:49,720
Pop up!

196
00:08:49,888 --> 00:08:50,947
- You got it!
- You got it!

197
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,818
- Jesus Christ!
- Shit!

198
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:54,920
I'm not angy.
Just give me the ball.

199
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,996
You son of a bitch!

200
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:01,161
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

201
00:09:01,534 --> 00:09:03,197
We look like shit.
Come on.

202
00:09:04,803 --> 00:09:06,136
Hey, DeVanzo...

203
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:09,742
If you're going to ask if you can suck
my left nut the answer is ''maybe''.

204
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:12,640
Do you ever think
that if I didn't exist...

205
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:15,347
your life wouldn't suck so bad?

206
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:19,549
We grew up the same age,
in the same town, at the same school.

207
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:21,919
If I wasn't around,
maybe you could've had what I have.

208
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:23,148
Wait, I forgot.

209
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:27,228
If I didn't exist,
you'd still be a total fucking jadrool.

210
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,868
Come on! Get it in into second!
Come on! Force at second!

211
00:09:37,337 --> 00:09:38,305
Out!

212
00:09:39,739 --> 00:09:41,299
He tripped him, Ump!
He tripped him!

213
00:09:41,741 --> 00:09:42,800
I didn't see it.

214
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:44,979
- Nice! Way to be!
- Cocksucker!

215
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:47,037
- Way to be!
- No, no, no!

216
00:09:47,114 --> 00:09:49,084
- Get off of me!
- Come on!

217
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,885
Put his head over here.

218
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:56,880
Come on!

219
00:10:00,493 --> 00:10:02,761
Don't stretch the shirt.

220
00:10:08,535 --> 00:10:09,663
This guy's such a pussy.

221
00:10:09,737 --> 00:10:11,501
Yeah? I'll La Motta
your face, okay?

222
00:10:11,572 --> 00:10:13,667
Yeah, let's go.
Returning for round two.

223
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:15,334
Come on, who wants to dance
with me again?

224
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:17,505
Who's feeling lucky?
You feeling lucky?

225
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:19,274
You're lucky the cops
showed up, okay?

226
00:10:19,346 --> 00:10:20,975
I'm ready.
I'm not tired.

227
00:10:21,048 --> 00:10:22,483
Who's feeling lucky?

228
00:10:22,817 --> 00:10:24,844
Don't eyeball me,
tough guy.

229
00:10:25,686 --> 00:10:28,886
When I was in the joint,
I fucked guys bigger than you.

230
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:33,922
What the hell
are we waiting for?

231
00:10:33,994 --> 00:10:36,124
Hey, did Dirt just say
he used to fuck guys?

232
00:10:36,564 --> 00:10:37,554
Never mind that.

233
00:10:37,632 --> 00:10:40,229
We're waiting to find out how much
trouble you got us into this time.

234
00:10:40,301 --> 00:10:41,769
Me? He started it.

235
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,708
Alright. Listen up.
First thing's first.

236
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:52,303
- DeVanzo?
- Yeah?

237
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,507
You're an asshole.

238
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,315
Now, as far as the fighting goes
between you're two guys' teams...

239
00:10:58,787 --> 00:11:00,723
this bullshit will not continue.

240
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:02,285
It happens evey year...

241
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:04,792
and it's the first game of the season,
for Christ's sakes.

242
00:11:04,893 --> 00:11:06,361
So, new year...

243
00:11:06,427 --> 00:11:08,990
one of you guys' teams is gonna
have to play in a different league.

244
00:11:09,197 --> 00:11:10,165
What?

245
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:12,928
Wow, I wonder who you gonna
decide to ask to leave?

246
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:15,196
I'm not gonna decide, ierk-off.

247
00:11:15,437 --> 00:11:19,810
Dennis Manganelli here suggested
you jerk-offs decide it on the field.

248
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,244
Whichever team does better
stays in the league.

249
00:11:22,378 --> 00:11:24,610
The other team is gone new year.

250
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,406
That sucks?

251
00:11:27,349 --> 00:11:29,478
- You gotta be kidding.
- We are so fucked.

252
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:31,885
I think we could do it.
All we gotta do is practice.

253
00:11:31,954 --> 00:11:34,151
Practice is for fags.
Hey, are we done here?

254
00:11:34,223 --> 00:11:35,714
Because I'm losing my buzz.

255
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,853
In two fucking seconds,
I'm gonna Taser you.

256
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,522
Anybody here who's not an asshole
have a question?

257
00:11:40,996 --> 00:11:41,930
I do.

258
00:11:42,064 --> 00:11:43,966
How come I'm the only one
who's locked up?

259
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:45,994
Be right with you.

260
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:52,509
How are we gonna deal with that?

261
00:11:59,882 --> 00:12:01,145
Hey, Linda.

262
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:02,417
Hey, Artie.

263
00:12:03,018 --> 00:12:04,488
Hey, et me buy you a drink.

264
00:12:04,554 --> 00:12:07,424
No, I can't. I gotta meet my friends
over at Ducky's.

265
00:12:08,157 --> 00:12:09,421
What happened to you?

266
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:10,785
Oh, this?

267
00:12:11,126 --> 00:12:13,963
I saw three guys mugging
an old lady, so I got involved.

268
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:16,399
- Really?
- Yeah, she was a tough old broad...

269
00:12:16,466 --> 00:12:18,368
but in the end we got her purse.

270
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:23,899
Bye-bye.

271
00:12:24,607 --> 00:12:25,666
Good night, Ed.

272
00:12:26,743 --> 00:12:28,645
Hey, Ed.
Get some beers over here.

273
00:12:29,112 --> 00:12:30,603
Whisky.
Come on.

274
00:12:30,814 --> 00:12:31,782
Jesus!

275
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:34,452
You like you had
the shit kicked out of you.

276
00:12:34,517 --> 00:12:36,612
Yeah? Imagine how
the other guy looks.

277
00:12:36,854 --> 00:12:41,022
I imagine a guy completely unharmed
with badly bruised knuckles.

278
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,595
Don't you have livers to ruin?

279
00:12:44,127 --> 00:12:45,790
Totally fucked, this man.

280
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:49,258
Listen, now that the games
mean something, we'll be great.

281
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:51,165
This is just gonna help us
play better.

282
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:53,098
Hey, Maz, do you think you can use
the fight as a reason...

283
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:55,641
to disinvite Manganelli
from your wedding?

284
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:58,038
He's Gina's cousin.
He's gonna be there.

285
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:00,777
And you're my best man,
so, you're gonna be there.

286
00:13:00,844 --> 00:13:03,441
And I'll have no bullshit
from either of you. I fucking swear.

287
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,107
Hey, I'm not one to start trouble.

288
00:13:05,182 --> 00:13:07,119
Oh, my God, you fat fucking liar.

289
00:13:07,184 --> 00:13:09,485
An insane thing to say.
Hello.

290
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:10,914
Hey, Gina.

291
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:13,457
Tell her you're still single
for six weeks and hang up.

292
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:17,055
Yeah. Yeah. I've been thinking quite
a bit about he cakes. Yeah.

293
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:18,859
Man, is he whipped.

294
00:13:20,197 --> 00:13:22,031
All right.
Now, that Maz is gone...

295
00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:24,502
we can talk a little bit
about his bachelor party.

296
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:29,271
Now, I've lined up five cousin ''hoors''
for the event.

297
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,310
One of them is called
''The Pitching Machine''.

298
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,345
Now, you're never
in a million fucking years...

299
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:36,349
eVer 90nna 9UeSS
why she's called that. Go ahead, guess.

300
00:13:36,948 --> 00:13:39,419
She shoots ping pong balls
out of her snatch?

301
00:13:40,852 --> 00:13:42,446
The name gives it away.

302
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,748
Guys, let me ask you a question.

303
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,922
Why do so many diners
have a ''happy waitress'' special?

304
00:13:49,994 --> 00:13:51,463
None of these waitresses
ever seem happy.

305
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,463
It's true.

306
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,933
They should call it
a ''bitchy broad with three kids...

307
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:57,470
no husband and a shitty
apartment in Linden'' special.

308
00:13:57,936 --> 00:13:59,496
Parts of Linden are nice.

309
00:13:59,637 --> 00:14:01,733
Hey, Rhonda.
I didn't mean anything by it.

310
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:04,277
But not the part I live in.
What do you guys want?

311
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,438
Let me get a bacon,
egg and cheese on a hard roll...

312
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:08,743
with side order of fries,
cheese and gra_...

313
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:09,873
and a bowl of gra_ on the side.

314
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,976
I'll have the same thing
plus pancakes.

315
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,850
- Chocolate milk?
- You know it, honey.

316
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,887
Make it two.

317
00:14:15,253 --> 00:14:17,588
I'll have an egg white omelet
made with vey little oil...

318
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,523
dy wheat toast
and grapefruit juice.

319
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:22,152
Oh, my God.
That's the gayest order I ever heard.

320
00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:25,063
In Massachusetts, that order
could legally mary a dude.

321
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,063
Here it comes.

322
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,694
Just placing an order like that
gets you kicked out of the army.

323
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:32,036
If you put a construction helmet on that
order, it could join the Village People.

324
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,471
Would you guys knock it off
so I can do my job?

325
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,635
Thank you.

326
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,269
All right, Maz.
That's an egg white omelet...

327
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,247
dy wheat toast, grapefruit iuice?

328
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,407
That right.

329
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,675
You want a side order
of cock with that?

330
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,288
We got it in fresh.
It's delicious.

331
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,327
- That people from Linden, I tell you...
- Trust me.

332
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,693
- G_ point.
- Come on!

333
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,532
So, what should we do now?

334
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:01,690
It's getting late.

335
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,670
Anyone with a job
should go home.

336
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:07,032
- Good night, Maz.
- Vey funny, ball tugger.

337
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:08,541
Good night, Johnny.

338
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:12,169
- Hey, I got an idea.
- What?

339
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,805
- Manhattan!
- What?

340
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,280
- No way. Can't do it.
- Come on.

341
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,478
The bars in the city
are open for four more hours.

342
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:19,511
Holy shit, it's midnight?
I gotta get home.

343
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,888
That's right, I forgot.

344
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:23,254
If you're home after midnight,
Gina locks up the pussy.

345
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:26,728
That's not completely true, all right?
Shut up, I'll give you a lift.

346
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,054
Holy shit.

347
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,766
- I'm hungy.
- I'm starving.

348
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,096
Isn't that the chick from the bar?

349
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,194
Oh, yeah!
That's Linda Salvo.

350
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,004
And she looks wasted.

351
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,875
Give me a quarter
you fucking bitch.

352
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,041
- Here, whore.
- Fuck you.

353
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,512
I've seen her in this diner
twice before when she was trashed...

354
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:47,173
and I banged her both times.

355
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:50,079
Hey, I'm a little tapped.
You got a sawbuck on you?

356
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:51,983
I usually gotta buy her
a Danish or something.

357
00:15:52,053 --> 00:15:53,784
- All I got is four bucks.
- That'll do it.

358
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:56,348
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good luck.

359
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:57,356
Don't need it.

360
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:00,388
Hey, Linda!

361
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:02,295
Hi.

362
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:03,696
What are you broads up to?

363
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:23,574
Artie?

364
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,749
Artie, wake up.

365
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,722
Hey, good morning, Linda.

366
00:16:33,828 --> 00:16:35,798
Artie, I gotta tell you.

367
00:16:36,131 --> 00:16:39,035
That was the worst sex
I have ever had.

368
00:16:39,234 --> 00:16:42,935
I'm catching shit from eveybody lately.
What was wrong with the sex?

369
00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:46,809
You got all out of breath.
You're like a chubby panda.

370
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:50,645
And then you finish in twenty seconds
and fell asleep on top of me.

371
00:16:50,713 --> 00:16:52,045
It was fucking horrible!

372
00:16:52,247 --> 00:16:55,014
Jesus Christ, I am so pathetic.

373
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:59,649
I get drunk and then I wake up
new to God knows what.

374
00:16:59,722 --> 00:17:01,919
My shrink says that I do it
because I think...

375
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,653
it's the only way a guy
could like me.

376
00:17:03,726 --> 00:17:04,989
Be honest with me, Artie.

377
00:17:05,093 --> 00:17:07,462
The only reason you like me
is because I fuck you.

378
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,089
Not at all.

379
00:17:09,732 --> 00:17:11,292
I mean, it's awesome.

380
00:17:12,101 --> 00:17:15,096
Look, I really like you.

381
00:17:15,604 --> 00:17:18,440
What do you say, you wanna go out
on a regular date or something?

382
00:17:18,807 --> 00:17:20,333
What? Are you serious?

383
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:23,104
Yeah, we could go out,
grab dinner...

384
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:25,149
and we don't have
to fuck or nothing.

385
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:27,749
It's vey fucking romantic, Artie.
Are you fucking retard?

386
00:17:27,817 --> 00:17:29,479
Well, do you know what they say
about retards...

387
00:17:29,552 --> 00:17:31,785
they have huge cocks
and superhuman strength.

388
00:17:31,988 --> 00:17:34,926
Well, congratulations,
you're definitely not retarded.

389
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:40,263
Look, what I mean is, we could just hang
out and we don't even have to have sex.

390
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:42,424
Yeah, right.
You're gonna come to my house...

391
00:17:42,499 --> 00:17:46,633
in your nice date clothes and pick me up
with like flowers and candies?

392
00:17:46,703 --> 00:17:49,334
Flowers, maybe, but evey time
I buy a chick candy...

393
00:17:49,406 --> 00:17:51,672
somehow, it never makes
all the way to her house.

394
00:17:54,877 --> 00:17:56,745
Come on! What do you say?

395
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,251
All right, Romeo.

396
00:18:02,552 --> 00:18:03,713
It's a date.

397
00:18:04,488 --> 00:18:05,478
Great!

398
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:09,120
And since I'm guaranteed
no sex on the date...

399
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:11,857
what do you say we take one
for the team right now?

400
00:18:11,996 --> 00:18:13,760
Artie, I'm gonna be late for work!

401
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,026
Come on!

402
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:19,199
Come on! An e_ra twenty seconds
ain't gonna matter. Come on, baby.

403
00:18:19,436 --> 00:18:20,369
All right.

404
00:18:20,437 --> 00:18:23,672
But this time you either gotta put
a rubber on or pull out before you come.

405
00:18:23,741 --> 00:18:26,473
Good morning, Artie.
Ready for breaMast?

406
00:18:26,543 --> 00:18:27,910
Sure, mom.

407
00:18:28,112 --> 00:18:29,239
Hey, this is Linda.

408
00:18:29,913 --> 00:18:32,477
Hello, Linda.
Would you like some breaMast too?

409
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,348
No, thanks.
I'm not hungy.

410
00:18:35,185 --> 00:18:36,745
Can you hand me my jacket,
please?

411
00:18:38,722 --> 00:18:39,713
Thank you.

412
00:18:40,057 --> 00:18:41,924
- Bye.
- Goodbye, Linda.

413
00:18:41,992 --> 00:18:43,221
Take care, Lin.

414
00:18:44,728 --> 00:18:46,460
Hey, mom, sory
if you overheard anything.

415
00:18:46,531 --> 00:18:49,058
- Is that your new girlfriend?
- Why? Do you like her?

416
00:18:49,134 --> 00:18:52,436
I like any girl that likes my Artie.

417
00:18:52,637 --> 00:18:54,630
Although clearly
she's been around the block...

418
00:18:54,705 --> 00:18:56,972
so I would feel better
if you used protection.

419
00:18:57,542 --> 00:18:59,102
Thanks for the advice, mom.

420
00:19:00,145 --> 00:19:02,581
Hey, mom, could you make some
gobblegoo and eggs?

421
00:19:04,782 --> 00:19:05,944
- Come on!
- Hear that! Hear that!

422
00:19:06,017 --> 00:19:06,950
Safe!

423
00:19:07,085 --> 00:19:09,112
- Get them!
- Over there!

424
00:19:09,187 --> 00:19:10,485
Turn two!

425
00:19:10,555 --> 00:19:11,819
- Get them.
- Come on!

426
00:19:13,058 --> 00:19:14,618
- Safe!
- Shithead!

427
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,554
Come on!

428
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:18,995
Not today, asshole.

429
00:19:20,398 --> 00:19:21,331
Nice shot.

430
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:22,732
Come on! Come on!
Score!

431
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:23,962
Come on! Come on!

432
00:19:24,035 --> 00:19:25,196
Go! Go! Go!

433
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:27,206
Jeez, you're dogging the tying run!

434
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:29,139
No, I'm not,
I'm standing on the third.

435
00:19:30,942 --> 00:19:32,707
That pile of elephant shit.

436
00:19:34,012 --> 00:19:34,945
- Papa!
- Shit!

437
00:19:35,013 --> 00:19:35,946
Papa!

438
00:19:39,185 --> 00:19:40,210
You're a retard!

439
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:42,882
That means your mother
must love blowing retards.

440
00:19:42,954 --> 00:19:43,887
- Hey, fuck you!
- Hey, hey, hey!

441
00:19:44,256 --> 00:19:45,724
It's a friend league!
Man, whoa!

442
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,420
- Stop!
- Fat piece of shit.

443
00:19:47,492 --> 00:19:49,486
We're all friends here, Maz,
do something.

444
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:51,554
- Play the game.
- Get a sense of humor, pal.

445
00:19:56,035 --> 00:19:57,401
I'm impressed, Artie.

446
00:19:57,837 --> 00:19:59,932
This is a really nice place.

447
00:20:00,206 --> 00:20:01,139
Yeah.

448
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:03,644
That Zagat dude
really knows his shit.

449
00:20:05,411 --> 00:20:06,538
Backed Avedon.

450
00:20:06,946 --> 00:20:07,936
That's me.

451
00:20:08,814 --> 00:20:11,342
- And gnocchi.
- That's me too.

452
00:20:11,884 --> 00:20:13,444
- Thanks, man.
- Alright.

453
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:14,453
Enioy.

454
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,614
- Take care.
- Thanks.

455
00:20:17,557 --> 00:20:18,650
So where do you work?

456
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,423
At the A&P in Lyndhurst.

457
00:20:28,168 --> 00:20:29,761
This is so odd.

458
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,035
What is?

459
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:37,303
I mean, we've already slept together
three times, right?

460
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,746
But, I mean,
we barely know each other.

461
00:20:40,147 --> 00:20:41,115
I know.

462
00:20:41,915 --> 00:20:43,645
It's fucking hot, right?

463
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,443
No, it's not.

464
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,413
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

465
00:20:50,724 --> 00:20:52,454
You work down at the port, right?

466
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:57,033
I was a longshoreman for nine years,
and then I quit last year.

467
00:20:57,097 --> 00:20:58,794
Haven't had a iob in while.

468
00:20:58,865 --> 00:20:59,799
Why did you quit?

469
00:21:01,268 --> 00:21:03,067
Mainly, my dad.

470
00:21:03,537 --> 00:21:05,666
Why'd your dad want you to quit?

471
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,533
Well, it wasn't like that exactly.

472
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:10,636
You see, he died.

473
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:13,838
Oh my God, I'm so sory.

474
00:21:13,914 --> 00:21:15,213
Thanks. I mean...

475
00:21:15,283 --> 00:21:17,310
he had a heart attack on the iob.

476
00:21:17,384 --> 00:21:19,719
He installed cable TV for a living.

477
00:21:19,787 --> 00:21:23,488
I had to watch him spend evey
waking hour doing a job that he hated.

478
00:21:23,557 --> 00:21:25,527
I mean the only time he was happy
was when someone would tip him...

479
00:21:25,592 --> 00:21:28,827
an e_ra twenty bucks to hook up
Cinemax illegally or something.

480
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:33,132
You know, I can see
why you quit your job.

481
00:21:33,467 --> 00:21:35,767
See, you don't want to like
spend your life...

482
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:38,741
doing something that you hated,
just like your father.

483
00:21:39,941 --> 00:21:43,711
You now what? That sounds great, but the
truth is I'm probably just a lazy prick.

484
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:49,044
You know,
I think you're a cute lazy prick.

485
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:50,385
Thanks.

486
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,280
But I've been doing all the yapping.
What about you?

487
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,051
You got any stories
about your father?

488
00:21:57,425 --> 00:21:58,894
Yeah, I got one.

489
00:22:00,094 --> 00:22:01,996
Once, when I was five years old...

490
00:22:02,063 --> 00:22:04,864
my dad went out to get ice cream
and he never came back.

491
00:22:06,901 --> 00:22:08,200
You serious?

492
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:11,367
Wow, I'm really sory.

493
00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:13,940
Don't be, shit happens.

494
00:22:14,109 --> 00:22:17,047
I can't imagine the pain
you must have been in because of that.

495
00:22:17,912 --> 00:22:20,213
But I think I got a way
to make you feel better right now.

496
00:22:20,282 --> 00:22:21,215
Oh, yeah?

497
00:22:22,284 --> 00:22:23,252
Waiter!

498
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:26,353
Order ice cream for this woman.
Pronto!

499
00:22:26,421 --> 00:22:27,411
Oh, God!

500
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:29,253
You're a fucking idiot, Artie.

501
00:22:29,324 --> 00:22:32,387
You know, I'm gonna have some too.
Waiter, three orders of ice cream.

502
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,725
Come on! What's up?

503
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:35,965
Come on, Artie,
are you ever serious?

504
00:22:36,031 --> 00:22:37,591
- No, and I tell you why.
- Why?

505
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,035
The only people who get laid
less than funny fat guys...

506
00:22:40,102 --> 00:22:43,803
are serious fat guys.
I feel sory for those assholes.

507
00:22:49,177 --> 00:22:50,146
Artie!

508
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:51,641
Artie, wait.

509
00:22:52,481 --> 00:22:54,144
I thought we weren't gonna
have sex tonight.

510
00:22:54,284 --> 00:22:56,754
I know!
What are you tying to pull here?

511
00:22:57,553 --> 00:22:59,250
Come on, Artie.

512
00:22:59,422 --> 00:23:01,255
Come on, this is important to me.

513
00:23:01,324 --> 00:23:04,888
That's cool. Although for
medical reasons I'll need a hand job.

514
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,893
Artie!

515
00:23:06,096 --> 00:23:10,036
Come on, I'll be quick.
It'll really help me get to sleep.

516
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,127
I can't mess up this car.
It's a lease.

517
00:23:12,201 --> 00:23:14,263
Hey, I have great aim.
Just let me know where you want it...

518
00:23:14,337 --> 00:23:16,500
ash tray, floor mat, change cup.

519
00:23:19,175 --> 00:23:20,507
All right, listen...

520
00:23:21,745 --> 00:23:23,145
if you're really quick...

521
00:23:23,546 --> 00:23:24,913
I'll give you a blowiob.

522
00:23:25,148 --> 00:23:26,514
But you gotta be quick.

523
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:28,415
Are you kidding me?
I hear you.

524
00:23:28,484 --> 00:23:32,049
When blowjobs go on too long, it's like
you chicks forget guy's dicks get tired.

525
00:23:32,122 --> 00:23:34,525
Stop with the jokes. I gotta be up
for work early tomorrow...

526
00:23:34,591 --> 00:23:35,684
so concentrate, okay?

527
00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:37,761
I'll be Hugh Fucking Downs.

528
00:23:38,261 --> 00:23:40,960
- Who the fuck is that?
- He was the host of ''Concentration''.

529
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:41,999
Just blow me.

530
00:23:44,868 --> 00:23:47,305
I made tiramisu.
You kids want some?

531
00:23:47,371 --> 00:23:49,500
No, mom! Go back inside!

532
00:23:49,673 --> 00:23:51,438
It's in the fridge
if you changed your mind.

533
00:23:51,508 --> 00:23:52,942
Back inside!

534
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,078
Just go! Just...

535
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:57,108
I am so embarrassed right now.

536
00:23:57,181 --> 00:24:00,119
You're embarrassed?
I just got cock-blocked by my mom.

537
00:24:04,688 --> 00:24:05,713
DeVanzo...

538
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,019
landscaping is
a vey strenuous work.

539
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:11,395
Do you think you can handle it? Because
you're not in the best of your shape.

540
00:24:11,729 --> 00:24:15,099
I'll give it a shot. But you better
give me the name of your dietitian.

541
00:24:37,189 --> 00:24:38,122
DeVanzo?

542
00:24:39,257 --> 00:24:40,657
DeVanzo! Wake up!

543
00:24:41,493 --> 00:24:42,859
You got one house left.

544
00:24:44,062 --> 00:24:44,995
Cool!

545
00:24:45,063 --> 00:24:45,996
All right.

546
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:50,593
Don't tell me is this place.

547
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:08,487
Hey! DeVanzo?

548
00:25:08,987 --> 00:25:10,216
Hot enough for you?

549
00:25:10,523 --> 00:25:12,389
I think you missed a spot
over there.

550
00:25:12,925 --> 00:25:14,417
And another one over there.

551
00:25:38,617 --> 00:25:39,881
- Out!
- Fuck!

552
00:25:41,754 --> 00:25:42,916
Way to be! Way to be!

553
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,457
Dave, looking good up there.

554
00:25:46,993 --> 00:25:49,692
Hey, hey, hey! Don't ty to kill it
up there, all right?

555
00:25:49,763 --> 00:25:51,665
Just get a nice base hit,
we'll start a rally.

556
00:25:51,731 --> 00:25:54,201
Come on, Maz? A home run ties it.
I'm going for it.

557
00:25:54,267 --> 00:25:57,262
Don't be stupid. No one's hit one out
of here since Dave Della Ferra in 1989.

558
00:25:57,336 --> 00:25:58,965
Why don't you think
I can do one too?

559
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:02,569
Because he bench pressed 400 pounds
and you sweat when you eat.

560
00:26:02,642 --> 00:26:03,940
So did Babe Ruth.

561
00:26:05,244 --> 00:26:06,838
The DeVanzo shift, guys.

562
00:26:08,348 --> 00:26:09,714
Meet the ball, Artie.
Come on.

563
00:26:09,783 --> 00:26:12,755
Hey, Artie, you guys find
a new league to play in yet?

564
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:15,450
Because one more out, chubs,
and we're 5-O.

565
00:26:15,722 --> 00:26:17,191
You guys are O-5.

566
00:26:17,624 --> 00:26:19,287
Home run coming up.

567
00:26:19,793 --> 00:26:22,230
That would be impressive
after you spent all that energy...

568
00:26:22,296 --> 00:26:24,163
mowing my lawn this afternoon.

569
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,325
I'm actually rooting for you.

570
00:26:28,068 --> 00:26:29,331
Here it comes, Tubby.

571
00:26:29,736 --> 00:26:31,467
And here it goes, prick.

572
00:27:07,575 --> 00:27:08,634
Yes!

573
00:27:08,709 --> 00:27:10,235
- Damn!
-5-O!

574
00:27:10,678 --> 00:27:13,241
5- O, baby! Yeah!

575
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:18,620
DeVanzo, you shithead. Watching you hit
into that double play...

576
00:27:18,686 --> 00:27:20,953
makes me wish
I was 35 years younger.

577
00:27:21,022 --> 00:27:22,787
I know, so you could kick my ass.

578
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:25,351
No, because I could kick your ass
right now...

579
00:27:25,426 --> 00:27:29,868
but 35 years ago, I could have loaned
your parents the money for an abortion.

580
00:27:38,607 --> 00:27:40,975
I can't believe you can joke around
like this when you're about...

581
00:27:41,042 --> 00:27:42,909
to get us kicked out
of the softball league.

582
00:27:43,344 --> 00:27:44,779
Maybe I should take up bowling.

583
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,851
It would be great to play a sport when
there's always a bar three feet away.

584
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:50,814
So you can get even more drunk
than you do now for softball?

585
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:53,118
Will you two stop?
We're not out of it yet.

586
00:27:53,189 --> 00:27:55,716
Maz, will you face facts?
We're out of it.

587
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,590
we're not playing softball
in this league...

588
00:27:57,659 --> 00:27:59,356
and you daughter
is an atrocious dancer.

589
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,093
We're not done.
We can still make the playoffs.

590
00:28:02,164 --> 00:28:05,968
Look, I admit that technically
we can still make the playoffs.

591
00:28:06,035 --> 00:28:08,871
Now you admit that
your daughter's dancing is a disgrace.

592
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,406
Fuck you, Johnny.
I'm gonna kill you.

593
00:28:10,472 --> 00:28:11,405
Go for it.

594
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,840
Maybe growing up
with a father in jail...

595
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:16,437
will help her dance
with just a hint of passion.

596
00:28:19,048 --> 00:28:20,573
- My man.
- You got it.

597
00:28:22,384 --> 00:28:23,785
Man, that was a tough loss.

598
00:28:24,153 --> 00:28:26,647
Yeah, I hate losing
to those fucking Guidos.

599
00:28:26,723 --> 00:28:29,091
Tim, will you watch it
with that word?

600
00:28:29,324 --> 00:28:30,726
- What? Guidos?
- Yeah.

601
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:32,990
Man, you all call each other that
all the time.

602
00:28:33,062 --> 00:28:34,691
Yeah, I know, but it's okay
when we say it.

603
00:28:34,764 --> 00:28:36,666
When you say it, it's racist.

604
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,529
All right, Alfonse.
I respect that.

605
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:45,137
Wait a minute, I don't respect that.
Guidos aren't a race.

606
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:47,743
You're a bunch of wiggers
who dress like the Sopranos.

607
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,372
Thank you.

608
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:53,118
I appreciate you setting up
the bachelor party...

609
00:28:53,183 --> 00:28:56,553
it's just I know you, all right?
No crazy shit. Promise me?

610
00:28:57,287 --> 00:28:59,780
Absolutely not.
Come on, what are you, kidding me?

611
00:29:01,524 --> 00:29:02,753
Eight in the corner.

612
00:29:05,228 --> 00:29:07,699
Hey, Maz, I've been meaning
to ask you a question.

613
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:11,370
I've been seeing this girl Linda
now for a little while...

614
00:29:11,434 --> 00:29:14,463
and, I don't know,
she's sort of becoming my girlfriend...

615
00:29:14,538 --> 00:29:18,638
and, I tell you what,
I could see things getting serious.

616
00:29:18,942 --> 00:29:21,174
- That's good for you, Art.
- Yeah.

617
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:24,408
But I'm sort of having
this one problem.

618
00:29:24,482 --> 00:29:25,507
Let me guess...

619
00:29:25,582 --> 00:29:27,849
you're tying to figure out
how to tell her about the herpes.

620
00:29:27,918 --> 00:29:29,251
No, no, she's got it too.

621
00:29:29,386 --> 00:29:31,448
Congratulations,
you've found your soul mate.

622
00:29:31,888 --> 00:29:34,520
Thanks.
But the thing is this...

623
00:29:34,891 --> 00:29:37,420
She's what most guys would,
I don't know...

624
00:29:37,495 --> 00:29:39,829
charitably call ''used goods''.

625
00:29:39,896 --> 00:29:42,425
Not for nothing, Art,
but you're what most girls...

626
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,663
would charitably call
a ''stinking piece of shit''.

627
00:29:44,735 --> 00:29:45,760
No offense.

628
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:49,133
I was offended there for a second,
but then you said ''no offense''...

629
00:29:49,207 --> 00:29:50,436
so now eveything is cool.

630
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:52,302
Anmay...

631
00:29:52,643 --> 00:29:56,812
the other day I was talking to her
and I was tying to figure out a way...

632
00:29:56,881 --> 00:30:00,217
to ask her how many guys
she's slept with.

633
00:30:00,985 --> 00:30:02,614
Why would you want to know that?

634
00:30:02,687 --> 00:30:05,453
I don't know, why does any guy want
to know? I just want to know.

635
00:30:05,757 --> 00:30:09,663
What I do know is she's been having sex
since she was 15 years old...

636
00:30:09,728 --> 00:30:12,461
so that's 15 years in the league.

637
00:30:12,531 --> 00:30:16,231
Conservatively,
she had to put away 25 or 30...

638
00:30:16,301 --> 00:30:18,828
- For what you told me about this girl...
- I know, you're right.

639
00:30:18,903 --> 00:30:21,340
She's gotta be in triple digits.
Anything less, is a lie.

640
00:30:21,406 --> 00:30:23,342
Anything more and I'm gonna pull
my fucking hair out.

641
00:30:23,408 --> 00:30:25,844
It's all part of her past.
Why do you let it bother you?

642
00:30:26,845 --> 00:30:27,835
Will you listen to me?

643
00:30:28,347 --> 00:30:30,317
My suggestion
is just drop the whole thing.

644
00:30:31,516 --> 00:30:32,745
I don't think I can.

645
00:30:33,151 --> 00:30:34,381
All right, fine.

646
00:30:34,553 --> 00:30:36,079
If you're gonna ask her,
you gotta be prepared...

647
00:30:36,154 --> 00:30:39,321
to answer the question yourself.
So what's your number?

648
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:42,931
Let's see. I used to be better
at keeping track of this.

649
00:30:44,496 --> 00:30:45,726
Seventy three.

650
00:30:45,831 --> 00:30:47,356
Not counting whores.

651
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:48,532
Six.

652
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:51,230
You're right,
I'll drop the whole thing.

653
00:30:55,207 --> 00:30:57,370
So mowing the lawns
almost killed me...

654
00:30:57,442 --> 00:30:59,139
but I was making
through the day...

655
00:30:59,211 --> 00:31:02,412
and then the last house turned out
to be that prick Manganelli's.

656
00:31:02,481 --> 00:31:03,472
Oh, no.

657
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:08,182
And then to top it off, he gets me to
hit into a double play to end the game.

658
00:31:08,254 --> 00:31:09,984
It was iust so fucking humiliating.

659
00:31:10,122 --> 00:31:11,887
I'm so sory, honey.

660
00:31:12,525 --> 00:31:14,324
Let's not talk about that asshole.

661
00:31:16,195 --> 00:31:18,632
You know, to tell you the truth,
all the shit with Manganelli...

662
00:31:18,697 --> 00:31:21,864
and us probably getting kicked out
of the softball league...

663
00:31:22,735 --> 00:31:25,036
it's really not bothering that much.

664
00:31:26,172 --> 00:31:27,265
Why not?

665
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:31,006
I think it's because of you.

666
00:31:32,913 --> 00:31:33,903
Yeah?

667
00:31:36,883 --> 00:31:39,650
Plus right now this weed
is helping out quite a bit.

668
00:31:41,121 --> 00:31:45,027
You know, my shrink says
you're really good for my self-esteem.

669
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:50,631
And out of all the guys I dated,
you're the only one she said that about.

670
00:31:51,965 --> 00:31:53,331
Hey, let's fuck!

671
00:31:54,468 --> 00:31:56,370
Artie, I don't want to wake
your mom up.

672
00:31:56,437 --> 00:31:59,203
Come on, don't wory.
My mother went to sleep hours ago.

673
00:31:59,273 --> 00:32:00,798
Artie, I don't know.

674
00:32:00,874 --> 00:32:03,539
Come on! These walls
are completely sound proof.

675
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:05,101
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah! Of course!

676
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:07,979
- Would I lie to you? Come on!
- No, you wouldn't lie.

677
00:32:08,048 --> 00:32:10,076
You could play drums
in this fucking room.

678
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:13,155
You could do the solo from Tom Samer
in this fucking room.

679
00:32:14,021 --> 00:32:15,284
Who is Tom Samer?

680
00:32:15,722 --> 00:32:17,749
It's a Rush song.
It's not important.

681
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,063
All right, I'm almost there.
Almost there.

682
00:32:22,296 --> 00:32:24,459
Just about there.
Almost there. Okay.

683
00:32:24,531 --> 00:32:26,695
Not quite yet. Almost there.
Almost there.

684
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:27,929
Grab my balls!

685
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,365
Pinch my nipples!

686
00:32:31,105 --> 00:32:32,539
Pinch me in the back!

687
00:32:32,773 --> 00:32:34,971
Harder! Harder!

688
00:32:35,075 --> 00:32:37,103
- That was too hard.
- Like this?

689
00:32:37,178 --> 00:32:38,545
That's it! That's pe_ect.

690
00:32:38,613 --> 00:32:40,377
Artie, wait.
I think the rubber slipped off.

691
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,381
Sory!

692
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,218
Oh, no!

693
00:32:46,488 --> 00:32:47,456
Shit!

694
00:32:47,522 --> 00:32:50,118
Nice hit. Nice hit.

695
00:32:50,425 --> 00:32:51,484
Way to go, Alfonse!

696
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:52,892
Yes!

697
00:32:53,127 --> 00:32:54,118
Come on, Art!

698
00:32:54,529 --> 00:32:55,758
Drive me in and we win it, buddy!

699
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,301
Get a hit or I'm gonna shove
that bat up your ass.

700
00:33:00,868 --> 00:33:03,066
- Yeah!
- Vey good!

701
00:33:05,106 --> 00:33:06,268
That's a nice tattoo.

702
00:33:06,341 --> 00:33:08,777
I didn't realize it was
the Chinese word for Guido.

703
00:33:10,145 --> 00:33:12,981
Actually, this is the Chinese symbol
for ''fuck you''.

704
00:33:13,248 --> 00:33:15,616
You know, this was great tonight, man.
Getting the first win, huh?

705
00:33:15,684 --> 00:33:17,016
Yeah, was.

706
00:33:17,085 --> 00:33:19,317
Kind of reminds me how
I'm gonna miss playing for this team.

707
00:33:19,521 --> 00:33:21,286
Hey, look, I'm gonna play
with my brother's team out...

708
00:33:21,356 --> 00:33:24,089
in Parsippany new year. You want me
to see if they need an infielder?

709
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,687
No, get to Parsippany is a pain
in the ass twice a week.

710
00:33:26,762 --> 00:33:28,425
You get traffic, Route 46...

711
00:33:28,497 --> 00:33:31,332
Hey, guys,
it ain't over till it's over.

712
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:34,496
Artie, you know I'm not the one
who want to give up but...

713
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,733
we're 1-5. It's pretty over.

714
00:33:36,805 --> 00:33:37,864
Way over.

715
00:33:38,106 --> 00:33:40,270
Hello?
Okay, I tell him.

716
00:33:40,443 --> 00:33:42,879
Hey, Art. That was Yogi Berra.
He says it's over.

717
00:33:43,812 --> 00:33:44,905
Jerk-off.

718
00:33:45,414 --> 00:33:48,045
There's a way to beat
Manganelli's team. We have to...

719
00:33:48,117 --> 00:33:51,989
I know what you are going to say, Art.
We gotta blow out Manganelli's fitness.

720
00:33:55,024 --> 00:33:56,652
Dave, how are things at home?

721
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,555
Not good, man.

722
00:34:00,629 --> 00:34:04,296
I'm holding in a huge piss,
so could you get to the point, shithead?

723
00:34:04,366 --> 00:34:06,360
All right.
We gotta practice.

724
00:34:07,937 --> 00:34:10,066
Aren't you the one that said
practice is for fags?

725
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:11,471
Yeah, that's when
you wanted to practice.

726
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:15,412
Look, this is a beer league.
Nobody practices and that can help us.

727
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:17,414
I've been hitting softballs
evey day...

728
00:34:17,481 --> 00:34:20,419
and I didn't drink before the game
tonight the first time ever.

729
00:34:20,484 --> 00:34:22,282
I could do that
for the whole season.

730
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:24,150
Look, I'm not saying
it's gonna be easy...

731
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,387
Manganelli's team is gonna win
first place for the regular season.

732
00:34:27,457 --> 00:34:30,190
We're gonna have to scratch and claw
and get into second place...

733
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,024
and then beat them
in the championship game.

734
00:34:32,095 --> 00:34:34,828
But if we start practicing,
I think we gotta a shot.

735
00:34:35,965 --> 00:34:39,735
Fellows, I've been paying softball
for a long time.

736
00:34:39,903 --> 00:34:42,636
This is not the best team
I've ever played on.

737
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,836
But it ain't the worst, either.

738
00:34:45,308 --> 00:34:49,079
So, if we would actually
practice evey day...

739
00:34:49,914 --> 00:34:52,476
then, like shithead says,
in this league...

740
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:54,382
we gotta a shot to win at all.

741
00:34:54,518 --> 00:34:55,543
How about it?

742
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,383
Let's have a toast.

743
00:34:57,521 --> 00:34:58,922
To beat Manganelli!

744
00:34:58,989 --> 00:35:01,984
Toast, my ass! I gotta piss so badly
I could drown a horse.

745
00:35:02,492 --> 00:35:04,189
Talk so fucking much.

746
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:06,364
All right, that put a damper
on the toast.

747
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:08,229
What do you say
we just practice tomorrow?

748
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:09,388
Salud.

749
00:35:11,101 --> 00:35:14,232
Bounding ball to the grindaloon
at third. He's got it.

750
00:35:17,542 --> 00:35:20,012
All right. We haven't turned
a double play in like three years...

751
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:23,015
so let's get two.
Come on. Artie is here now.

752
00:35:23,214 --> 00:35:24,182
Let's get two.

753
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:33,756
Good effort! Good effort!
Way to go! Way to go!

754
00:35:33,824 --> 00:35:34,757
Damn!

755
00:35:35,326 --> 00:35:37,558
You assholes know
I'm being sarcastic, right?

756
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:39,830
Come on. Let's get two.

757
00:35:43,334 --> 00:35:45,031
- Damn!
- Ty not to spread your legs...

758
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:46,571
like a two buck hooker.

759
00:35:48,707 --> 00:35:50,700
Good, Maz!
When you wait it on like that...

760
00:35:50,742 --> 00:35:53,839
you don't have to lunge for the ball.
All right. Way to be.

761
00:35:54,012 --> 00:35:57,075
Now, Johnny, I noticed you've been
dropping your front shoulder.

762
00:35:57,148 --> 00:35:59,015
Wait a minute,
you're telling me how to hit?

763
00:35:59,184 --> 00:36:01,120
Please, I'm batting.687.

764
00:36:01,252 --> 00:36:03,051
It's like telling Ted Williams
how to hit.

765
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:06,826
Really? I always thought of you
as more like a Pete Rose type.

766
00:36:06,891 --> 00:36:09,021
You know, a shitty gambler
with bad hair.

767
00:36:10,161 --> 00:36:11,187
Hit it!

768
00:36:17,069 --> 00:36:20,769
Jesus Christ! It's like a bunch
of monkeys tying to screw a football.

769
00:36:23,042 --> 00:36:26,310
Nice hit, Tim.
Way to be. Beautiful.

770
00:36:29,348 --> 00:36:31,511
You know, Dave,
you might be a lefty.

771
00:36:32,551 --> 00:36:33,484
Yeah.

772
00:36:33,552 --> 00:36:35,078
Let's get two.
Come on!

773
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:40,919
What the fuck are you doing?

774
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,093
Jump!

775
00:36:45,598 --> 00:36:47,396
Second base is over there, moron!

776
00:36:47,634 --> 00:36:48,829
Sory, Johnny. I...

777
00:36:48,968 --> 00:36:50,562
Jesus Christ!

778
00:36:53,939 --> 00:36:55,773
That is iust amul.

779
00:36:56,442 --> 00:36:57,502
Really?

780
00:36:57,644 --> 00:37:00,046
- I thought I hit that pretty good.
- No, your hitting is fine.

781
00:37:00,112 --> 00:37:03,142
I'm talking about
that disgusting Guido pink shirt.

782
00:37:03,216 --> 00:37:04,184
Go home and change it.

783
00:37:04,251 --> 00:37:05,776
All right, technically,
this is fuchsia.

784
00:37:05,851 --> 00:37:07,515
Out of my sight! Go!

785
00:37:07,687 --> 00:37:08,950
I'm gonna throw up.

786
00:37:09,289 --> 00:37:12,125
- Jesus Christ!
- I'm going to see my brajool.

787
00:37:13,093 --> 00:37:14,561
- Let's get two.
- Come on, fellows.

788
00:37:15,095 --> 00:37:16,028
Come on!

789
00:37:20,233 --> 00:37:21,599
- Yeah!
- All right!

790
00:37:21,668 --> 00:37:24,538
That's what I'm talking about.
Come on now!

791
00:37:24,604 --> 00:37:26,905
Now do that again and prove
that was not just luck.

792
00:37:26,973 --> 00:37:27,964
Let's do this.

793
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:32,242
Great.
Get two now. Two.

794
00:37:32,312 --> 00:37:33,280
Come on now!

795
00:37:33,714 --> 00:37:36,207
- Yeah!
- That's what I'm talking about.

796
00:37:36,283 --> 00:37:39,050
- All right!
- Way to be!

797
00:37:41,655 --> 00:37:44,456
- That's the way to do it.
- Way to be! Way to be!

798
00:37:44,758 --> 00:37:46,021
Come on now, folks!

799
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,188
Come on, good, Guido.

800
00:37:50,831 --> 00:37:52,391
Eveybody hits.

801
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,331
- Run, Artie!
- Slow down, asshole.

802
00:37:57,538 --> 00:37:59,735
One hopper, DeVanzo.
he's got it.

803
00:38:03,377 --> 00:38:04,675
- Out!
- Yeah!

804
00:38:07,048 --> 00:38:08,311
Throw to first!

805
00:38:09,951 --> 00:38:11,853
- Out!
- Nice, Art. Way to pick it.

806
00:38:11,919 --> 00:38:13,890
How about it? How about it?

807
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,156
- Good play.
- Nice.

808
00:38:17,225 --> 00:38:20,026
- Way to be.
- Don't get cocky, fucknuts.

809
00:38:20,527 --> 00:38:22,361
All right, let's go.
No stick up here.

810
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:25,127
No stick? Hey, Crispino,
what's your batting average?

811
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:27,932
Fuck you, Johnny. Who keeps that
in slow pitch softball?

812
00:38:28,002 --> 00:38:30,336
I'm hitting.687.
Thank you.

813
00:38:31,706 --> 00:38:32,765
Nice shot!

814
00:38:33,908 --> 00:38:34,876
Strike three!

815
00:38:34,942 --> 00:38:37,881
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

816
00:38:40,182 --> 00:38:42,448
Nice catch!

817
00:38:42,517 --> 00:38:44,077
- Look at you!
- All right.

818
00:38:56,899 --> 00:38:59,301
What do you say now? Here we go.
Turn it now. Come on!

819
00:38:59,368 --> 00:39:00,393
I'm on it, Johnny.

820
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:01,836
Out!

821
00:39:01,904 --> 00:39:03,771
.463. Nice.

822
00:39:03,972 --> 00:39:08,073
No carbs. Lobster,
prime rib, those little clams.

823
00:39:08,143 --> 00:39:10,113
Whatever you want.
Want to drive?

824
00:39:10,212 --> 00:39:11,579
- Yeah!
- I don't think so.

825
00:39:14,249 --> 00:39:15,513
What the fuck!?

826
00:39:19,555 --> 00:39:21,491
DeVanzo, you motherfucker!

827
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:24,822
Way to hit it, man.
Nice shot!

828
00:39:25,661 --> 00:39:26,822
Yeah!

829
00:39:26,896 --> 00:39:28,159
- That's right!
- All right!

830
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:30,201
- Congratulations!
- Nice shot!

831
00:39:30,266 --> 00:39:32,862
Ten to five, baby!
Ten to five!

832
00:39:33,403 --> 00:39:34,598
Nice shot!

833
00:39:48,651 --> 00:39:53,286
Step right up and shoot the geek.
One hundred shots for five dollars.

834
00:39:53,356 --> 00:39:55,759
Oh, my God! Yeah!
This is getting ugly.

835
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,059
- All right.
- Artie, knock it off!

836
00:40:02,265 --> 00:40:03,529
- Get him in his balls.
- Okay.

837
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,590
Get his balls.

838
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:09,304
On theses wheels I bet on Mom
evey single time.

839
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:11,035
Because I love my mom, you know?

840
00:40:11,107 --> 00:40:12,838
- That's so cute.
- Thanks.

841
00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:14,408
All right.
Come on, ''Mom''!

842
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:16,414
- Come on, ''Mom''!
- Come on! ''Mom'', what do you say?

843
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,743
Come on, ''Mom''!

844
00:40:17,814 --> 00:40:19,784
One time with ''Mom''.
Just one time.

845
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,410
Come on, motherfucker ''Mom''!

846
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:24,389
Motherfucker! Hit ''Mom''!
Motherfucker! Come on, ''Mom''!

847
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:27,484
Fuck! Fuck! Shit!
Cock! Fuck!

848
00:40:27,557 --> 00:40:30,394
Mothe_ucker! Let's get away
from this crooked fucking game.

849
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:39,773
It's hard to say
because I totally believe in God...

850
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:42,271
but I have lots of problems
with the Church.

851
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,967
I don't think I want to be married
in a church...

852
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,069
because I would feel like
a total hypocrite.

853
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:52,414
I sort of feel the same way, you know.
I'm not religious at all...

854
00:40:52,484 --> 00:40:54,477
but my mother
went to Catholic school...

855
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:57,524
so, you know, she would really want me
to get married by a priest.

856
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,525
So I thought
of this great compromise.

857
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,025
If I ever get married...

858
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:04,896
it's going to be by a justice of
the peace who's also a child molester.

859
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,791
You're so going to hell for that.

860
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,027
What? Come on!

861
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:17,041
Five dollars, hotshot!
Where are you going? Knock it out.

862
00:41:17,242 --> 00:41:19,235
You know where you mother is?
She's waiting to pick me up.

863
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:21,281
Five dollars. Purple monkey.

864
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:24,716
What's up, slugger? Five bucks.
Yours, baby. Purple monkey.

865
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:27,151
- Purple monkey, man!
- All right, Artie, you can do it!

866
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:28,813
Purple monkey, man!

867
00:41:30,022 --> 00:41:31,547
All right, baby.
That's a good start.

868
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:33,525
Gotta have to settle
for a pink bear, man.

869
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,254
- Pink bear, man!
- Come on, baby.

870
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:38,322
You got nothing!

871
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:39,722
Nothing!

872
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:41,092
- All right.
- Dude!

873
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:42,700
I got the look.

874
00:41:42,768 --> 00:41:44,567
- This is going to be the one, right?
- Purple monkey!

875
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:46,367
Because he ain't going
to get it today.

876
00:41:46,439 --> 00:41:48,568
Loosing his hair,
down on his luck...

877
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,269
perhaps too fat for his age.

878
00:41:50,343 --> 00:41:53,907
He's with a hot chick
who is clearly out of his league.

879
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:56,473
Forget about it. I don't even want
one of those stupid purple monkeys.

880
00:41:56,549 --> 00:41:59,783
No, on this one, I'm getting you
a prize. I guarantee, all right?

881
00:41:59,852 --> 00:42:01,719
- Okay.
- Here, catch, douche!

882
00:42:33,219 --> 00:42:35,747
Marie, you're a beautiful dancer.

883
00:42:38,324 --> 00:42:39,657
Atrocious.

884
00:42:39,826 --> 00:42:41,819
- Johnny!
- Unwatchable.

885
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:43,227
- Stop it!
- It's amul.

886
00:42:43,397 --> 00:42:45,526
- Lovely.
- No, it's not lovely.

887
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,092
Someone's gotta tell her.
She stinks.

888
00:42:48,168 --> 00:42:50,536
Look, I don't know what Artie
has planned for this bachelor party...

889
00:42:50,604 --> 00:42:52,540
Honey, it's no big deal, all right?
Johnny, you ready?

890
00:42:52,606 --> 00:42:55,305
And I don't want to know,
it's just my father might stop by...

891
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:56,673
- for a little while.
- I know.

892
00:42:56,743 --> 00:42:58,679
And if he does,
would you please show some respect?

893
00:42:58,745 --> 00:42:59,678
Absolutely.

894
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:00,942
Don't wory about nothing.
I'll bring him back in one piece.

895
00:43:01,015 --> 00:43:02,142
- You see?
- Come on.

896
00:43:02,215 --> 00:43:03,445
All right, honey,
I'll see you later.

897
00:43:04,484 --> 00:43:05,509
Whatever.

898
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,213
All right, let's go.

899
00:43:09,823 --> 00:43:11,885
Gina, relax.

900
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:14,327
They alI have bachelor parties.
It's no big deal.

901
00:43:14,561 --> 00:43:19,230
Marie, stay away from the street,
sweetheart. Just dance on the lawn.

902
00:43:20,801 --> 00:43:23,067
Marilyn, it's not the bachelor party
that I'm worried about, you know...

903
00:43:23,137 --> 00:43:26,109
it's just I can't relax when I know
he's going out with fuckhead.

904
00:43:26,173 --> 00:43:27,300
You mean Artie?

905
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:29,368
Did you know that at
Carol Monteverdi's wedding...

906
00:43:29,444 --> 00:43:31,414
he got drunk and he punched
the deejay in the face...

907
00:43:31,479 --> 00:43:34,041
because the guy wouldn't play
''Rock Me, Amadeus''?

908
00:43:34,315 --> 00:43:37,047
Well, we aI know
he's kind of pathetic...

909
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:40,716
but I like Artie, and I don't think
he's quite so obnoxious any more.

910
00:43:41,656 --> 00:43:43,285
The 2-2 pitch to Birkenstock.

911
00:43:44,525 --> 00:43:45,959
Yeah!

912
00:43:46,027 --> 00:43:47,655
Down the line!
He may have it!

913
00:43:47,728 --> 00:43:49,095
It's got the foul pole!

914
00:43:49,164 --> 00:43:50,132
Home run!

915
00:43:50,364 --> 00:43:51,298
Nice shot.

916
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:15,783
Hey, no!

917
00:44:16,257 --> 00:44:17,817
Scavooch, what the fuck?

918
00:44:17,892 --> 00:44:20,831
And the crowd is going crazy
here at Bush Stadium.

919
00:44:22,764 --> 00:44:25,998
And DeVanzo is looking to lace
one back through the hole.

920
00:44:28,303 --> 00:44:29,795
A little chin music.

921
00:44:29,871 --> 00:44:31,568
And he may charge the round.

922
00:44:33,308 --> 00:44:36,042
That's okay, it's cool. If I have to,
I'll snort the fucking rag.

923
00:44:36,512 --> 00:44:39,882
- Tone that spitter, honey.
- Come on, let's take a look at that.

924
00:44:43,953 --> 00:44:44,943
You got to have that.

925
00:44:45,021 --> 00:44:46,923
Wait, you almost fucked us up
over here.

926
00:44:46,989 --> 00:44:49,482
- Dude, you got to catch that.
- I'm not catching that shit.

927
00:44:53,395 --> 00:44:55,764
- He's got his own stick.
- This is going to be a good one.

928
00:44:59,035 --> 00:45:00,230
Pete LeCock!

929
00:45:00,402 --> 00:45:01,769
Salud!

930
00:45:01,837 --> 00:45:03,329
- Salud.
- Drink this.

931
00:45:03,405 --> 00:45:05,136
- Salud!
- Salud more!

932
00:45:07,076 --> 00:45:09,343
- You're tying to kill me here.
- Come on, one more. I love you.

933
00:45:25,562 --> 00:45:27,054
- Fuck, cops.
- Shit!

934
00:45:29,699 --> 00:45:31,498
What the fuck is going on in here?

935
00:45:33,503 --> 00:45:35,132
Eveybody freeze.

936
00:45:38,575 --> 00:45:40,739
- Shit!
- Hey, you son of a bitch!

937
00:45:41,278 --> 00:45:43,510
Hey, look at him.
Hey, relax, guys.

938
00:45:44,281 --> 00:45:45,306
Hey.

939
00:45:45,882 --> 00:45:47,476
This is my cousin Mickey.

940
00:45:47,651 --> 00:45:49,119
He's a Boston cop.

941
00:45:51,188 --> 00:45:52,247
Funny.

942
00:45:55,325 --> 00:45:58,662
Scared the shit out of you all Derek
Jeter-loving motherfuckers, didn't l?

943
00:45:58,862 --> 00:46:01,333
Hey, man, have a drink.
Have some fun.

944
00:46:01,398 --> 00:46:02,890
- Sure, Maz.
- Thanks for coming.

945
00:46:02,966 --> 00:46:05,027
Hey, black man.
Hook me up with some coke, will you?

946
00:46:06,737 --> 00:46:08,400
Want a slice there,
Pitching Machine?

947
00:46:08,972 --> 00:46:10,874
No, I don't eat daiy.

948
00:46:11,075 --> 00:46:13,045
The Pitching Machine
doesn't eat daiy.

949
00:46:13,477 --> 00:46:14,877
A lot of rules.

950
00:46:15,046 --> 00:46:16,947
Fuck you, ho.
You ain't taking money out of my pocket.

951
00:46:17,014 --> 00:46:18,643
Fuck you, bitch.
I saw him first.

952
00:46:18,716 --> 00:46:20,549
You're the one taking money
out of my pocket.

953
00:46:20,618 --> 00:46:22,087
Come on, ladies.

954
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:24,547
Neither if you even have pockets.

955
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:31,059
Honey, your prices are outrageous.

956
00:46:31,595 --> 00:46:34,762
I remember when a man could get
his cock clean for five bucks.

957
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:38,604
I'll clean your cock for five bucks,
but a blowjob is still fifty.

958
00:46:39,237 --> 00:46:40,638
Let me call my wife.

959
00:46:41,906 --> 00:46:43,238
Hey, there he is.

960
00:46:44,776 --> 00:46:46,301
- Dennis.
- How do you feel?

961
00:46:46,711 --> 00:46:48,304
Did you come in a convertible?

962
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,948
Don't be iealous.

963
00:46:50,315 --> 00:46:51,783
- Get a drink.
- All right.

964
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,615
Have a good time.
It's your last chance.

965
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:57,120
Hey, Ed, what is
the ''Elect Zinna'' bullshit?

966
00:46:58,022 --> 00:46:59,491
Fucking bitch.

967
00:47:07,132 --> 00:47:08,293
What happened to you?

968
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,937
While I was getting a blowjob the other
whore punched my whore in the mouth.

969
00:47:13,338 --> 00:47:14,830
You better ice that shit, money.

970
00:47:18,778 --> 00:47:21,476
Hey, thanks so much
for putting this together.

971
00:47:21,546 --> 00:47:23,676
I'm having a fucking great time.

972
00:47:23,749 --> 00:47:25,411
Don't wory about it, brother.

973
00:47:26,084 --> 00:47:28,522
Hey, listen,
Manganelli just showed up.

974
00:47:28,587 --> 00:47:29,886
Yeah, I saw him.

975
00:47:29,955 --> 00:47:31,720
No fight, please.

976
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:33,184
I promise!

977
00:47:33,258 --> 00:47:35,821
Listen, Maz, I'm in a vey
different place right now.

978
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:38,731
- I really don't care about Manganelli.
- That's what I want to hear.

979
00:47:38,798 --> 00:47:39,925
- All right?
- That's great, Artie.

980
00:47:39,998 --> 00:47:45,705
Okay, now, all hoors front and center!
Time to rape the bachelor! Come on!

981
00:47:45,771 --> 00:47:48,538
I'm not doing it!
I'm not doing it!

982
00:47:48,607 --> 00:47:50,840
- I'm not doing it!
- Tough shit. You're doing it!

983
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:55,352
- Have at him, ladies.
- You're a liar, you motherfucker.

984
00:47:55,514 --> 00:47:57,007
No! Please!

985
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:59,246
Maz is getting his pipes cleaned.

986
00:47:59,319 --> 00:48:00,514
Hang in there, Maz.

987
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,351
Maz, you're down
for the count, bro.

988
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:04,916
Jesus Christ.
Artie? Artie? Artie?

989
00:48:04,991 --> 00:48:06,790
Hey, I'm a little busy right now.

990
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,955
I thought you said
you're not gonna do coke anymore.

991
00:48:09,028 --> 00:48:10,931
Bachelor parties don't count.

992
00:48:11,231 --> 00:48:12,894
Asshole, it's Gina's father.

993
00:48:13,499 --> 00:48:15,766
I would rather not be naked
in front of my friends right now.

994
00:48:15,836 --> 00:48:20,300
Shit. He looks pissed.
I was hoping he'd be cool.

995
00:48:20,373 --> 00:48:22,844
You know, like your father was
in your bachelor party.

996
00:48:22,909 --> 00:48:24,469
Yeah, he was the best.

997
00:48:24,544 --> 00:48:26,913
I can't believe I walked in on him
getting a hummer.

998
00:48:27,046 --> 00:48:28,015
What?

999
00:48:28,648 --> 00:48:29,582
Nothing.

1000
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:33,851
Hey, this dude looks like he's going
to freak out. I better go talk to him.

1001
00:48:34,455 --> 00:48:36,652
I'm supposed to go to confession
new week.

1002
00:48:42,129 --> 00:48:43,392
Cheap shit.

1003
00:48:45,332 --> 00:48:49,033
I don't know if you guys know this,
but I'm getting married vey soon.

1004
00:48:49,103 --> 00:48:50,298
Hello, sir.

1005
00:48:50,371 --> 00:48:53,502
No, please!
I have a child.

1006
00:48:53,573 --> 00:48:56,775
I have a five-year-old.
Wow!

1007
00:48:57,711 --> 00:48:59,305
Boy, Maz has a big cock.

1008
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:03,286
I'm going to kill you,
you motherfucker!

1009
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:04,944
He's got no respect for his elders.

1010
00:49:06,587 --> 00:49:07,817
Get off him!

1011
00:49:08,322 --> 00:49:10,919
What the fuck is the matter
with you? Get off him!

1012
00:49:15,129 --> 00:49:18,101
Hey, thanks for letting me
do bumps with you.

1013
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,934
You want that blowiob now?

1014
00:49:20,167 --> 00:49:21,431
No, I'm good.

1015
00:49:23,004 --> 00:49:24,131
That's a first.

1016
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,936
She must be pretty special.

1017
00:49:27,575 --> 00:49:29,066
Yeah, she is.

1018
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,137
Bye.

1019
00:49:31,212 --> 00:49:32,146
Take care.

1020
00:49:34,715 --> 00:49:38,281
Art, Maz is pissing all over himself
behind the bar.

1021
00:49:38,686 --> 00:49:42,023
Well, it's not a bachelor party
unless somebody pisses his pants.

1022
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:44,185
Actually, he managed
to get it out of his pants.

1023
00:49:45,994 --> 00:49:48,795
Look, Maz, I know I owe you
for that time you helped me out...

1024
00:49:48,864 --> 00:49:52,030
when I shit my pants on Mardi Gras,
but now we're even, man.

1025
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,833
Wow! How much did you drink,
motherfucker?

1026
00:49:54,903 --> 00:49:58,034
Jesus Christ, Maz!
Maz!

1027
00:49:59,608 --> 00:50:02,603
All right, it looks like the well
is running dy finally.

1028
00:50:02,678 --> 00:50:05,548
Now, if you could just get your dick
back to your pants on your own...

1029
00:50:05,614 --> 00:50:07,607
eveything will be fine,
all right, man?

1030
00:50:08,817 --> 00:50:09,978
Hey, DeVanzo.

1031
00:50:10,853 --> 00:50:13,916
I know why you're here,
but I'm not letting you blow Maz.

1032
00:50:13,989 --> 00:50:15,356
Of course not.

1033
00:50:15,524 --> 00:50:17,460
That's your job,
you son of a bitch.

1034
00:50:17,593 --> 00:50:20,997
In case you haven't notice,
the party is over. Get out.

1035
00:50:21,263 --> 00:50:24,634
All right, I'm going.
Say hi to Linda for me.

1036
00:50:25,201 --> 00:50:26,226
What?

1037
00:50:26,635 --> 00:50:29,835
Linda Salvo, your girlfriend.

1038
00:50:30,339 --> 00:50:32,707
She didn't tell you
she used to go to my gym?

1039
00:50:32,909 --> 00:50:33,842
No.

1040
00:50:33,943 --> 00:50:36,175
Yeah. Cute girl.

1041
00:50:36,746 --> 00:50:39,512
She earned quite a few free
membership months in my office...

1042
00:50:39,582 --> 00:50:40,710
if you know what I mean.

1043
00:50:41,851 --> 00:50:43,650
Anmay, say hi to her for me.

1044
00:51:32,169 --> 00:51:33,330
Hey, honey.

1045
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,972
You look like
you haven't slept a wink.

1046
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:41,570
I taped the Yankee game for you.

1047
00:51:41,812 --> 00:51:42,745
Thanks.

1048
00:51:44,649 --> 00:51:47,644
So, were you naughty
at the bachelor party?

1049
00:51:48,819 --> 00:51:50,288
Actually, I wasn't.

1050
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:55,860
Linda, I have something important
I want to ask you.

1051
00:51:56,194 --> 00:51:58,060
Really? What is it?

1052
00:51:58,229 --> 00:51:59,754
Did you fuck Manganelli?

1053
00:52:03,568 --> 00:52:04,866
Artie...

1054
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:07,404
Just answer the question, please.

1055
00:52:08,006 --> 00:52:09,804
Look, I don't want to talk
about this, okay?

1056
00:52:09,874 --> 00:52:12,675
I just... No matter what you think,
it's not important.

1057
00:52:12,743 --> 00:52:15,374
Could you just answer
the fucking question, please?

1058
00:52:16,848 --> 00:52:17,873
All right.

1059
00:52:18,249 --> 00:52:19,650
The answer is yes.

1060
00:52:19,818 --> 00:52:20,843
Fuck!

1061
00:52:21,052 --> 00:52:22,179
How could you?

1062
00:52:22,253 --> 00:52:24,348
Artie, it was over two years ago!

1063
00:52:24,422 --> 00:52:26,985
Right, and I had to hear about it from
him. Why couldn't you tell me yourself?

1064
00:52:27,058 --> 00:52:30,258
How could I? You're completely
consumed with this guy.

1065
00:52:30,328 --> 00:52:32,765
You're finally just starting
to get over it.

1066
00:52:33,164 --> 00:52:34,633
Look, I don't think
about this jerk...

1067
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,536
and I don't want you to think
about him either. All right?

1068
00:52:37,669 --> 00:52:40,003
I just want us to be happy
like we are.

1069
00:52:41,906 --> 00:52:43,170
Come on.

1070
00:52:43,842 --> 00:52:46,746
This is too fucked up.
I don't think I can handle it.

1071
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,380
What do you mean you don't think
you can handle it?

1072
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:53,447
What?
You want to break up over this?

1073
00:52:54,819 --> 00:52:56,312
You know what?
Yeah, I do.

1074
00:52:57,957 --> 00:52:59,789
Are you fucking kidding me?

1075
00:52:59,859 --> 00:53:02,591
Over something that happened
years before I met you?

1076
00:53:03,029 --> 00:53:06,433
You feel bad so now you want
to make me feel bad too, right?

1077
00:53:06,665 --> 00:53:07,633
God, you're iust...

1078
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,466
You're not a man!
You're a fucking little bitch.

1079
00:53:10,836 --> 00:53:13,034
God, you're fucking unbelievable!

1080
00:53:13,239 --> 00:53:14,936
I could fucking kill you!

1081
00:53:15,141 --> 00:53:17,578
Damn Yankees fuck ass!

1082
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:19,439
Nasty loser ass!

1083
00:53:19,979 --> 00:53:23,646
Take your stinking
loser jersey too!

1084
00:53:23,849 --> 00:53:26,082
Fat fuck! Fucking asshole!

1085
00:53:28,154 --> 00:53:30,215
Can I get some more fries here,
Rhonda?

1086
00:53:31,324 --> 00:53:34,353
You know, women who date fat guys
are often mentally unstable.

1087
00:53:35,162 --> 00:53:36,289
Yeah, it's true.

1088
00:53:36,696 --> 00:53:38,222
They call them ''chubby chasers''.

1089
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:41,395
- Rhonda, I'm still here.
- One order of fries coming up.

1090
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:50,579
Asshole! Asshole!

1091
00:53:50,777 --> 00:53:52,076
Asshole!

1092
00:53:54,214 --> 00:53:56,081
I'm telling you,
this chick is good for Artie.

1093
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,916
- I got my own problems.
- Thanks for the free bat, asshole.

1094
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:04,189
Hey, Art, you know what?
You can't hold this on this chick now.

1095
00:54:04,257 --> 00:54:06,056
I mean I know it's a pain in the ass
to deal with it...

1096
00:54:06,126 --> 00:54:07,925
I can't deal with it. It's over.

1097
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:10,192
This is the first chick
you've ever been serious about.

1098
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:12,929
Come on, you finally met a broad
who doesn't care about your drinking...

1099
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,995
or the fact you're 35 years old
and you still live with your mom.

1100
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:19,474
And she doesn't mind that a man with
your weight should be about 6'2''.

1101
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:21,373
Plus you factor
in the herpes thing and...

1102
00:54:21,442 --> 00:54:22,501
Asshole!

1103
00:54:22,743 --> 00:54:23,733
Enough!

1104
00:54:23,977 --> 00:54:25,173
Me and her are through.

1105
00:54:25,746 --> 00:54:28,115
So now who are you going to take
to my wedding...

1106
00:54:28,282 --> 00:54:29,375
if there is one?

1107
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:31,680
What do you mean
if there still is one?

1108
00:54:31,785 --> 00:54:35,384
You know, Art, I asked you not to let
things get crazy at the bachelor party.

1109
00:54:35,957 --> 00:54:37,289
Now I got to be worried,
you know?

1110
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:39,760
I'm afraid Gina's father is going
to tell her what went on there.

1111
00:54:40,228 --> 00:54:41,719
No, he's not.

1112
00:54:41,863 --> 00:54:42,796
Yeah, how do you know?

1113
00:54:42,864 --> 00:54:45,164
He's not going to break
the bachelor party code.

1114
00:54:45,233 --> 00:54:48,729
No man tells a woman what goes on
at a bachelor party.

1115
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:51,506
So what happened
at Michael's bachelor party?

1116
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:52,901
Nothing.

1117
00:54:53,107 --> 00:54:55,100
So what went on
at Maz's bachelor party?

1118
00:54:55,176 --> 00:54:56,109
Nothing.

1119
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:58,370
So what went on
at the bachelor party?

1120
00:54:58,445 --> 00:54:59,437
Nothing, baby.

1121
00:54:59,814 --> 00:55:03,344
We've been married for 43 years and
you still won't tell me what goes on...

1122
00:55:03,418 --> 00:55:05,479
at one bachelor party?

1123
00:55:06,688 --> 00:55:07,951
Fuck off.

1124
00:55:10,425 --> 00:55:11,825
No, I'm going to be honest
with Gina.

1125
00:55:11,893 --> 00:55:13,522
I'll feel better
if I just tell her what happened.

1126
00:55:13,595 --> 00:55:16,431
- Are you fucking insane?
- No, no, no, asshole!

1127
00:55:16,498 --> 00:55:19,231
Evey once in a while, some moronic
pussy does spill the beans...

1128
00:55:19,301 --> 00:55:20,428
and it's always a disaster.

1129
00:55:20,669 --> 00:55:22,970
Forgive me!
Please, don't go!

1130
00:55:23,038 --> 00:55:24,301
I'll die without you!

1131
00:55:24,373 --> 00:55:25,773
Get away from me,
you whore-lover.

1132
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,277
You said you watched porno so you
wouldn't have to do things like that.

1133
00:55:28,343 --> 00:55:29,743
Look, I wish I hadn't done it...

1134
00:55:29,811 --> 00:55:32,510
but I'm insecure and it feels like
it's going to fall off.

1135
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:35,918
If it doesn't, give me a call
and I'll come back and I'll cut it off!

1136
00:55:37,152 --> 00:55:38,484
Cut what off, mommy?

1137
00:55:39,454 --> 00:55:41,481
- I know. I know.
- Here he comes, here it goes.

1138
00:55:41,556 --> 00:55:44,084
It's a pe_ect day for softball
here at the stadium.

1139
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:46,995
55 thousand on hand
for Johnny Trinno.

1140
00:55:47,062 --> 00:55:50,000
Bobblehead Day here.
I mean it's a great day for the kids.

1141
00:55:50,065 --> 00:55:52,035
All fans 16 and under will get one.

1142
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,834
And can Johnny go
for the.700 batting average?

1143
00:55:54,904 --> 00:55:57,501
- Do you ever shut the fuck up?
- No, I don't.

1144
00:55:57,873 --> 00:55:58,932
.698.

1145
00:55:59,309 --> 00:56:01,643
- Nice one, baby!
- Go, Johnny!

1146
00:56:01,744 --> 00:56:03,179
- Come on, Artie.
- Big stick, Artie.

1147
00:56:03,246 --> 00:56:06,514
Would you look at Artie.
You know, he really thinks who he is.

1148
00:56:06,582 --> 00:56:09,418
Fucking best man at my wedding.
And he better behave.

1149
00:56:09,485 --> 00:56:11,478
Gina, you've got to stop.
Stop worying.

1150
00:56:11,554 --> 00:56:13,524
- Marilyn, stop worying?
- Yeah.

1151
00:56:13,589 --> 00:56:15,218
Did you know that
at Donna Delvecchio's wedding...

1152
00:56:15,291 --> 00:56:18,161
he pissed in the centerpieces
and got the priest high?

1153
00:56:19,896 --> 00:56:20,829
Okay.

1154
00:56:21,497 --> 00:56:23,399
Oscar Gamble stile, baby.

1155
00:56:26,002 --> 00:56:27,493
Way to go, fuckhead.

1156
00:56:29,505 --> 00:56:30,667
Yeah!

1157
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,507
Yes, Artie!

1158
00:56:32,576 --> 00:56:33,976
Way to go, Artie.
I knew you could do it, pal.

1159
00:56:34,043 --> 00:56:34,977
We did it!

1160
00:56:35,512 --> 00:56:37,413
So back during
college basketball season...

1161
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:39,610
my buddy Scheky tells me
he's got this system.

1162
00:56:39,683 --> 00:56:42,985
He says it's an absolute lock
when you have this combination, right?

1163
00:56:43,052 --> 00:56:45,616
Big East team on the road...

1164
00:56:45,689 --> 00:56:49,093
give them less than six points
with a white point guard, all right?

1165
00:56:49,158 --> 00:56:51,960
So I bet St. John's against Duke
and I lose big...

1166
00:56:52,028 --> 00:56:53,224
I mean, really big, right?

1167
00:56:53,297 --> 00:56:54,856
So I said to Scheky,
I go, ''Look, man...

1168
00:56:54,931 --> 00:56:57,164
the only time a white point guard
is a good thing...

1169
00:56:57,234 --> 00:56:59,704
is when your sister tells you
she's dating a point guard.''

1170
00:57:03,907 --> 00:57:05,969
Hey, Tim,
I didn't see you there, man.

1171
00:57:07,077 --> 00:57:08,603
That's a funny ioke, man.

1172
00:57:09,146 --> 00:57:10,341
You like that ioke?

1173
00:57:10,848 --> 00:57:12,248
Yeah, what's not to like about it?

1174
00:57:12,316 --> 00:57:13,979
It's about how you guys suck
at basketball...

1175
00:57:14,051 --> 00:57:15,542
and how good we fuck
your women.

1176
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,251
I never thought about it like that.

1177
00:57:21,292 --> 00:57:23,489
- We got a better lineup than they got.
- Totally.

1178
00:57:23,561 --> 00:57:25,622
That's why they slacked off
the second half.

1179
00:57:25,696 --> 00:57:28,065
He got the champagne...

1180
00:57:28,132 --> 00:57:29,465
- Hey, guys!
- Hey!

1181
00:57:29,534 --> 00:57:32,597
- What's up? How you doing?
- Hey, Art, listen to this.

1182
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:35,072
Carino Autobody lost to
Muchugrasso Overhead Doors...

1183
00:57:35,139 --> 00:57:36,972
so now we're tied for second
with Carino.

1184
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:39,604
- Hey, our last game is against Carino!
- That's right.

1185
00:57:39,677 --> 00:57:41,544
It's going to come down
to the last day here.

1186
00:57:41,612 --> 00:57:44,881
Does Ed's Bar and Swill win the right to
face Manganelli in the championship...

1187
00:57:44,949 --> 00:57:46,316
and save the team?

1188
00:57:46,384 --> 00:57:48,012
Or perhaps even more dramatic...

1189
00:57:48,086 --> 00:57:51,081
does Joking Johnny Trinno
bat.700?

1190
00:57:51,156 --> 00:57:54,720
Asshole, will you forget about
your batting average for one second?

1191
00:57:54,792 --> 00:57:56,728
We gotta beat
that prick Manganelli.

1192
00:57:56,862 --> 00:57:59,857
Artie, what exactly do you have
against my cousin?

1193
00:57:59,932 --> 00:58:02,528
Well, number one, he's a prick.
Number two, he's a cock.

1194
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,762
Number three, he's a dick.

1195
00:58:03,802 --> 00:58:06,774
Congratulations, you know
three different words for ''penis''.

1196
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:08,638
Four, now that
you taught me ''penis''.

1197
00:58:09,107 --> 00:58:11,270
All right, guys, relax, okay?
Does anybody need a drink?

1198
00:58:11,343 --> 00:58:13,576
- Eveybody be nice.
- All right, let's change the subject.

1199
00:58:13,645 --> 00:58:17,916
Artie, are you bringing Linda to the
wedding or are you guys still broken up?

1200
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,748
No, we're broken up for good.

1201
00:58:19,885 --> 00:58:22,550
You know, Gina actually offered
to set you up with one of her cousins.

1202
00:58:22,621 --> 00:58:25,752
Hey, great! I heard your cousin
Manganelli gives a mean blowjob.

1203
00:58:25,891 --> 00:58:28,522
You know what, Artie?
You sit on this and rotate.

1204
00:58:28,594 --> 00:58:31,430
Gina, your flirting is making eveyone
at the table uncomfortable.

1205
00:58:31,497 --> 00:58:34,367
Come on, Art, take it down a notch.
she's just tying to help you.

1206
00:58:34,433 --> 00:58:36,665
Hey, I'm not some loser
who can't get a...

1207
00:58:36,735 --> 00:58:39,001
Wait, you're not talking about
your cousin Tracy with the tits?

1208
00:58:39,072 --> 00:58:40,904
No, Tracy's married now,
thank you.

1209
00:58:40,974 --> 00:58:44,971
Hey, I'm not some loser who can't get
a date! I'm doing just fine on my own.

1210
00:58:45,945 --> 00:58:47,675
Hello, is Karen Denver there?

1211
00:58:48,147 --> 00:58:50,515
Karen? It's Artie DeVanzo!

1212
00:58:50,884 --> 00:58:53,252
Yeah, Artie, from Union High!

1213
00:58:53,685 --> 00:58:56,385
That's right, we haven't spoken
since I took you to the prom.

1214
00:58:58,024 --> 00:59:00,221
That's right, I did call you
from jail after.

1215
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:04,700
Well, listen, I was just sitting
in the office here...

1216
00:59:04,764 --> 00:59:07,634
and I was wondering...
Do you remember my friend Maz?

1217
00:59:08,535 --> 00:59:10,367
Yeah, well, he's getting married
this weekend...

1218
00:59:10,404 --> 00:59:12,270
and I was wondering
if you want_ tD go with me.

1219
00:59:12,939 --> 00:59:15,968
Yeah, I was remembering
all the fun times we used to have.

1220
00:59:17,344 --> 00:59:18,778
What do you mean ''what fun''?

1221
00:59:18,978 --> 00:59:21,381
By my count, we banged
at least 26 times. Hello?

1222
00:59:22,115 --> 00:59:25,919
No kidding, Gigi.
You're strictly into chicks now?

1223
00:59:26,253 --> 00:59:28,723
Hey, did I have something
to do with that?

1224
00:59:29,589 --> 00:59:30,614
I did?

1225
00:59:32,626 --> 00:59:34,893
So then you got divorced
from that guy too?

1226
00:59:34,962 --> 00:59:36,760
Boy, Brenda, you really know
how to pick them.

1227
00:59:37,697 --> 00:59:38,961
I'm iust teasing you.

1228
00:59:39,633 --> 00:59:42,696
Yeah, yeah, thanks.
It's really great to talk to you too.

1229
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:45,639
I'm so glad that nerd at the libray
taught me how to Google.

1230
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:47,536
Listen, let me tell you
why I'm calling...

1231
00:59:48,542 --> 00:59:50,136
You know already? Really?

1232
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:56,412
Right, I did tell you l'd pay you back
that 200 bucks I borrowed from you...

1233
00:59:56,484 --> 00:59:57,975
no matter how long it took.

1234
01:00:03,624 --> 01:00:04,649
Hi, this is Linda.

1235
01:00:04,725 --> 01:00:07,754
I can't come to the phone right now,
so, please, leave me a message.

1236
01:00:08,429 --> 01:00:10,194
Hey, it's Artie.

1237
01:00:10,264 --> 01:00:13,065
I know we haven't talked in awhile,
so this is kind of aw_ard...

1238
01:00:13,134 --> 01:00:14,227
but...

1239
01:00:14,702 --> 01:00:16,467
Look, eveything was my fault.

1240
01:00:16,537 --> 01:00:19,407
I know I get crazy sometimes
you know and...

1241
01:00:20,008 --> 01:00:20,976
well...

1242
01:00:21,709 --> 01:00:22,642
I don't know, listen...

1243
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:25,945
I'm going to stop talking into your
machine before this gets embarrassing.

1244
01:00:26,014 --> 01:00:27,414
Give me a call if you get a chance.

1245
01:00:27,482 --> 01:00:29,281
But I miss you.

1246
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:30,611
I miss you a lot.

1247
01:00:30,986 --> 01:00:31,919
Bye.

1248
01:00:33,521 --> 01:00:34,717
So, you're going to call him?

1249
01:00:36,825 --> 01:00:37,918
I don't know.

1250
01:00:38,126 --> 01:00:40,962
I mean I still really care about Artie,
but he really hurt me.

1251
01:00:43,031 --> 01:00:47,096
Either way, keep this quiet,
because it was a big mistake.

1252
01:00:47,168 --> 01:00:48,694
Why? Because I'm black?

1253
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:51,305
No, because
you're fucking married!

1254
01:00:52,341 --> 01:00:53,934
All right, my bad.

1255
01:00:56,811 --> 01:00:58,007
What do you say now, Dave?

1256
01:00:58,079 --> 01:00:59,571
Hang in there.

1257
01:00:59,648 --> 01:01:01,709
- Hang in there.
- Land her, baby.

1258
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:04,414
Nice and easy. Nice and easy.
Bring the ball. Come on, Dave.

1259
01:01:04,486 --> 01:01:06,115
Run him on now.
Come on!

1260
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:07,721
Strike three!

1261
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,782
Oh, my God! I can't wait
to go home and get high!

1262
01:01:09,858 --> 01:01:10,986
Holy shit.

1263
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:13,189
Some of the greats
strike out, Dave.

1264
01:01:13,262 --> 01:01:17,100
That's right, striking out in slow pitch
softball is nothing to be ashamed of.

1265
01:01:17,332 --> 01:01:19,030
All right, Johnny.
All right, Johnny!

1266
01:01:19,101 --> 01:01:20,694
It's all you, baby!
Bring me in.

1267
01:01:20,903 --> 01:01:24,137
Two outs here in the last inning,
with the winning run on second.

1268
01:01:24,206 --> 01:01:27,076
Who would you want up more
than Johnny Trinno?

1269
01:01:27,143 --> 01:01:28,976
It's been a magical year
for Johnny...

1270
01:01:29,045 --> 01:01:32,576
as he comes to the last game
with a.699 average.

1271
01:01:32,649 --> 01:01:34,174
All right, come on,
it's getting dark.

1272
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:37,154
Yet Trinno's star shines
as bright as ever.

1273
01:01:38,187 --> 01:01:39,520
Nice hit, Johnny!
That's it.

1274
01:01:39,589 --> 01:01:42,185
Come on, Maz, go!
Screw your slide!

1275
01:01:42,258 --> 01:01:44,525
Go, come on, slide, slide!

1276
01:01:44,594 --> 01:01:47,395
Your slide! Head for a slide!
Head for a slide!

1277
01:01:50,132 --> 01:01:51,065
Shit.

1278
01:01:51,133 --> 01:01:52,966
What did you slide for?
They didn't even throw the ball.

1279
01:01:55,705 --> 01:01:57,106
Why the helI did you tell me
to slide?

1280
01:01:57,174 --> 01:02:00,476
I was just fucking with you.
We're in the championship!

1281
01:02:09,652 --> 01:02:12,453
Listen, Johnny, I don't have a date
for the wedding yet.

1282
01:02:12,522 --> 01:02:15,723
What? I thought you took care ofthat.
The wedding is this afternoon.

1283
01:02:15,793 --> 01:02:18,993
I know, I struck out all over the place.
Hey, do you think Marilyn...

1284
01:02:19,062 --> 01:02:21,259
could get one of her friends
to go with me last minute?

1285
01:02:21,331 --> 01:02:26,798
Look, Art, Marilyn's female friends are
all lawyers, bankers and executives...

1286
01:02:27,938 --> 01:02:30,101
So what are you saying,
that they're too good for me?

1287
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,407
No, no, I was tying to let
the silence say it for me.

1288
01:02:33,544 --> 01:02:36,208
Artie, even if Marilyn could help you,
it's too late.

1289
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:39,343
Nobody cares if you have a date.
Just come by yourself.

1290
01:02:39,783 --> 01:02:43,085
I can't do that, Johnny.
That's all right, man.

1291
01:02:43,154 --> 01:02:45,147
I still got one chick left
I could call.

1292
01:02:59,003 --> 01:03:01,064
It's almost time to get it started.
Where the hell is Artie?

1293
01:03:01,139 --> 01:03:03,770
I just called the house. His mom said
some girl came and picked him up.

1294
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:05,742
What the...?
I don't believe this shit!

1295
01:03:09,413 --> 01:03:12,545
Look, Johnny, if this scumbag
isn't here in five minutes...

1296
01:03:12,617 --> 01:03:15,247
we start without him.
You step in as best man.

1297
01:03:15,319 --> 01:03:16,252
Yes, sir.

1298
01:03:20,992 --> 01:03:23,623
That's so sad that you
and your girlfriend broke up.

1299
01:03:23,695 --> 01:03:25,460
You're such a sweetie.

1300
01:03:25,664 --> 01:03:27,497
Here. You want a bump
to cheer you up?

1301
01:03:27,899 --> 01:03:29,562
No, that's all right.
Maybe later.

1302
01:03:29,801 --> 01:03:31,828
You know you just flew through
a stop sign, right?

1303
01:03:33,037 --> 01:03:36,772
Who are you to talk, silly?
You don't even have a driver's license.

1304
01:03:37,709 --> 01:03:39,576
Well, at least
we're making good time.

1305
01:03:39,644 --> 01:03:41,477
All right, the church is like
two minutes from here...

1306
01:03:41,546 --> 01:03:43,345
so, just go straight,
but slow down.

1307
01:03:43,682 --> 01:03:46,552
Slow down! Slow down!
Pitching Machine, look out!

1308
01:03:52,691 --> 01:03:54,024
I saved us!

1309
01:03:54,459 --> 01:03:55,928
Yeah, you're a real hero.

1310
01:03:56,295 --> 01:03:57,558
Come on, let's go.

1311
01:03:57,630 --> 01:03:59,121
Wait, let me powder my nose.

1312
01:04:02,768 --> 01:04:04,293
Fuck me.

1313
01:04:10,443 --> 01:04:13,347
Hey, DeVanzo, you're free to go.

1314
01:04:14,246 --> 01:04:15,510
Hey, what time is it?

1315
01:04:15,715 --> 01:04:16,705
Five a.m..

1316
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:18,779
Shit!

1317
01:04:22,288 --> 01:04:25,283
- Look, I know I messed up.
- Messed up...

1318
01:04:25,358 --> 01:04:26,986
All right, screwed up.
fucked up!

1319
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:30,089
- I really am sory.
- Stop, all right? Don't even...

1320
01:04:30,596 --> 01:04:33,899
We've been friends for 30 years.
You're my best man.

1321
01:04:33,967 --> 01:04:36,301
How could you miss my wedding?
What the hell is the matter with you?

1322
01:04:36,369 --> 01:04:37,895
Man, I'm sory.

1323
01:04:37,971 --> 01:04:40,032
Well, I'm not. At least the fucking
Pitching Machine...

1324
01:04:40,106 --> 01:04:41,131
didn't end up on my wedding.

1325
01:04:41,207 --> 01:04:43,234
Look, I don't know how many times
I have to say this...

1326
01:04:43,309 --> 01:04:44,744
but I really am sory!

1327
01:04:44,811 --> 01:04:46,610
You know, those words,
they have no meaning coming from you...

1328
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,616
all right?
They're shit.

1329
01:04:48,682 --> 01:04:51,016
I've had enough of your ''I'm sorys''
to last my lifetime.

1330
01:04:51,351 --> 01:04:52,478
''I'm sory I missed your wedding.''

1331
01:04:52,552 --> 01:04:54,249
I'm sory I started
that fight with Manganelli.

1332
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,951
I'm sory I got drunk and stole
your dad's ice cream truck.''

1333
01:04:57,023 --> 01:04:58,013
I mean I could go on...

1334
01:04:58,091 --> 01:05:00,460
Wait, the ice cream truck thing
I was 12 years old.

1335
01:05:00,527 --> 01:05:02,120
Yeah, and you haven't changed
a bit!

1336
01:05:02,963 --> 01:05:06,368
You selfish prick! You even manage
to make my wedding about you.

1337
01:05:06,433 --> 01:05:09,633
Obviously you don't want to be around me
and don't blame you.

1338
01:05:09,970 --> 01:05:11,303
I'm going to quit the team.

1339
01:05:11,372 --> 01:05:13,000
Team? What team?

1340
01:05:13,072 --> 01:05:15,510
We're going to lose the championship and
then the team's over because of you...

1341
01:05:15,575 --> 01:05:18,139
so don't go fucking talking to me
about the team, all right?

1342
01:05:18,212 --> 01:05:19,874
- What the fuck?
- What...

1343
01:05:20,247 --> 01:05:21,306
- Hey, it's Dirt!
- Dirt!

1344
01:05:21,382 --> 01:05:23,284
- Johnny.
- Man, hury up! Call an ambulance.

1345
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:24,682
Dirt? Dirt?

1346
01:05:24,751 --> 01:05:27,052
We need an ambulance
here at the Tamblin Field.

1347
01:05:27,121 --> 01:05:28,749
- Shit, Dirt.
- Hang on, we're getting help.

1348
01:05:35,229 --> 01:05:39,033
- I can't believe you really did it.
- He always said that's what he wanted.

1349
01:05:39,099 --> 01:05:41,002
I want to go out iust like that.

1350
01:05:44,038 --> 01:05:47,238
Gentlemen, later today
we're playing for the championship...

1351
01:05:47,308 --> 01:05:50,280
and for the survival of
Ed's Bar and Swill softball team.

1352
01:05:50,512 --> 01:05:52,379
But right now
I want to do a toast...

1353
01:05:52,447 --> 01:05:55,283
to a fallen friend
and a teammate, Dirt...

1354
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:57,752
the greatest softball pitcher
of all time.

1355
01:05:58,653 --> 01:05:59,586
To Dirt.

1356
01:05:59,921 --> 01:06:01,618
- Dirt.
- Dirt.

1357
01:06:04,759 --> 01:06:06,854
Hey, Ed, what do you say?
Set up some more.

1358
01:06:07,062 --> 01:06:08,826
To be honest,
if Dirt hasn't died...

1359
01:06:08,896 --> 01:06:11,892
I wouldn't even be talking
to you right now...

1360
01:06:11,967 --> 01:06:15,201
but I stilI don't want
our friendship to end, all right?

1361
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:16,636
Me neither, man.

1362
01:06:16,704 --> 01:06:18,264
Look, Maz,
this ain't a good excuse...

1363
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:19,900
but I just couldn't show up
to your wedding...

1364
01:06:19,975 --> 01:06:22,468
in front of fucking Manganelli
without a date.

1365
01:06:22,544 --> 01:06:25,209
It would have been too humiliating
after that thing with Linda.

1366
01:06:25,413 --> 01:06:28,476
Artie, don't let that prick get to you.
That's what fucks eveything up.

1367
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:30,845
That's when you become
the asshole.

1368
01:06:31,353 --> 01:06:34,622
I want to beat him in softball too.
And ends there.

1369
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:37,123
You can't let that guy ruin
your whole freaking life.

1370
01:06:37,826 --> 01:06:40,058
I know, I know.
You're right, man. You're right.

1371
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:41,829
I mean, you got to let it go.

1372
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:45,401
And if he doesn't, you should.

1373
01:06:46,167 --> 01:06:48,035
Fuck it.
I'm just going to let it go.

1374
01:06:48,103 --> 01:06:50,039
I'm done worying about
Dennis Manganelli.

1375
01:06:50,105 --> 01:06:51,038
All right.

1376
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:52,735
Thanks for talking to me
like this, man.

1377
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:54,641
You'd do the same thing for me,
you know?

1378
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:57,910
No, I would have went behind your back
telling eveyone what a dick you were.

1379
01:06:58,481 --> 01:06:59,676
Hey, lovebirds...

1380
01:06:59,748 --> 01:07:01,513
sory to interrupt your little date
over there...

1381
01:07:01,584 --> 01:07:03,781
but we're toasting Dirt.
Your shots are accumulating.

1382
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,378
All right, all right, we're coming.

1383
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:07,925
Not to much drinking. We got
a championship game in two hours.

1384
01:07:07,991 --> 01:07:10,052
I know.
Let's just drink one toast to Dirt.

1385
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:13,892
To the greatest rock and roll band
of all time...

1386
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:15,488
Molly Hatchett.

1387
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:17,258
Fucking all right.

1388
01:07:20,837 --> 01:07:21,770
Watch.

1389
01:07:22,005 --> 01:07:24,772
I'm going to place this pe_ectly.

1390
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:32,906
Asshole.

1391
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:34,948
Ed, another round of tequila.

1392
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:39,892
You guys finished all my tequila.
Dave drank the last bottle by himself.

1393
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:44,722
Last night I had a dream that I killed
evey single one of you guys.

1394
01:07:45,195 --> 01:07:46,595
Relax, Dave. Hey!

1395
01:07:47,031 --> 01:07:49,297
Easy, Dave. Come on!

1396
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,198
Hey, what time is it?

1397
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:53,496
Holy shit, its almost game time.
We got to go.

1398
01:07:53,637 --> 01:07:55,368
Eveybody got their bats and gloves
in their trunk, right?

1399
01:07:55,439 --> 01:07:56,372
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1400
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,773
Yeah, just got to go home
and get my uniform.

1401
01:07:57,841 --> 01:07:59,435
- Yeah, me too.
- We ain't got time.

1402
01:07:59,509 --> 01:08:02,481
If we're two seconds late, Manganelli's
going to call for a fo_eit.

1403
01:08:02,546 --> 01:08:04,448
We got to go straight to the field.

1404
01:08:04,514 --> 01:08:07,817
- One more drink and then we'll go.
- No, no, we got to leave right now.

1405
01:08:07,885 --> 01:08:09,410
Come on.
You riding with me, Art?

1406
01:08:09,486 --> 01:08:11,080
Thanks, man.
Let's go, eveybody!

1407
01:08:11,155 --> 01:08:12,088
Come on, let's go!

1408
01:08:13,491 --> 01:08:16,895
I can't let nine guys
drive out of here drunk.

1409
01:08:16,961 --> 01:08:19,558
Well, I'm riding with Maz,
so it's really just eight.

1410
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:22,192
- Come on, I'm fine.
- We do it evey weekend.

1411
01:08:22,267 --> 01:08:24,362
I can't let you guys
drive out of here all shimmed up.

1412
01:08:24,435 --> 01:08:25,630
Jeez.

1413
01:08:25,703 --> 01:08:27,502
Well, then you have to drive
all of us.

1414
01:08:28,673 --> 01:08:31,907
Open the door before I shove
that stupid fucking cooler up your ass.

1415
01:08:31,976 --> 01:08:33,912
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out!

1416
01:08:33,978 --> 01:08:36,415
What the fuck?
Let's move!

1417
01:08:36,814 --> 01:08:39,217
Man, both my legs are asleep.

1418
01:08:39,284 --> 01:08:40,981
Both my balls are asleep.

1419
01:08:41,052 --> 01:08:42,680
I don't want to hear
about your balls.

1420
01:08:42,753 --> 01:08:44,086
Hail May, full of grace...

1421
01:08:44,155 --> 01:08:46,854
Don't pray like that, all right?
God hates Guidos.

1422
01:08:46,925 --> 01:08:48,120
Shit!

1423
01:08:49,527 --> 01:08:52,465
It looks like the circus with all
the clowns coming out of the car.

1424
01:08:52,698 --> 01:08:53,688
Where's Dave?

1425
01:08:53,765 --> 01:08:54,892
Did we forget Dave?

1426
01:08:56,434 --> 01:08:59,099
Anybody bring any weed?
I left mine at the funeral home.

1427
01:09:01,339 --> 01:09:02,467
Play ball!

1428
01:09:03,775 --> 01:09:04,743
Oh, Christ.

1429
01:09:06,645 --> 01:09:08,136
I'm going to fucking die out here.

1430
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:09,878
I'm fucked up, bro.

1431
01:09:09,948 --> 01:09:11,007
Bourbon and tequila?

1432
01:09:11,249 --> 01:09:12,217
Come on, Art.

1433
01:09:12,584 --> 01:09:14,281
All right, let's look intelligent!

1434
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:15,913
Look alive.

1435
01:09:16,288 --> 01:09:17,813
Get ready to lose!

1436
01:09:17,889 --> 01:09:20,122
And here comes DeVanzo.

1437
01:09:20,392 --> 01:09:22,919
He's a sandy-haried,
slender-thighed...

1438
01:09:22,994 --> 01:09:25,727
long-legged,
big beautiful young man...

1439
01:09:25,797 --> 01:09:27,630
with excellent bone structure.

1440
01:09:28,034 --> 01:09:29,900
The pussy he must get on the road.

1441
01:09:30,102 --> 01:09:31,127
Hey, look.

1442
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:33,797
Drunk rookie pitcher on the mound.

1443
01:09:34,106 --> 01:09:35,734
We're going to destroy you.

1444
01:09:36,208 --> 01:09:37,871
You've never even pitched before.

1445
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:41,312
No, but ifyou would do it,
it can't be that hard, bro.

1446
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:42,405
Come on.

1447
01:09:42,749 --> 01:09:45,812
DeVanzo wheels, deals,
rocks, kicks the up ring.

1448
01:09:51,957 --> 01:09:53,723
What the fuck are we doing here?

1449
01:09:53,926 --> 01:09:56,591
- You have done that before, haven't you?
- Shut up!

1450
01:09:56,662 --> 01:09:58,131
I'm still going to strike you out.

1451
01:09:58,197 --> 01:10:00,258
A_! A_!
Don't let him get to you.

1452
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:01,895
Come on.

1453
01:10:03,135 --> 01:10:04,297
Well. Well.

1454
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:05,464
Beautiful.

1455
01:10:09,842 --> 01:10:11,778
Ball four.
Take you base.

1456
01:10:11,844 --> 01:10:14,111
Yeah, I got a feeling
he will be saying that a lot today.

1457
01:10:15,348 --> 01:10:16,281
Come on, Art.

1458
01:10:18,085 --> 01:10:20,317
Shit, it's going to be
a long game, bro.

1459
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:22,323
All right, don't wory, don't wory.
He'll settle in.

1460
01:10:23,023 --> 01:10:24,423
Hey, Art.
Come on, Art.

1461
01:10:24,690 --> 01:10:26,524
Come on, Artie, focus.
Come on.

1462
01:10:32,565 --> 01:10:33,555
Yeah! Double play!

1463
01:10:33,634 --> 01:10:35,432
Yeah! Come on, Johnny.
Get it! Get it!

1464
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:39,737
Shit! Shit!

1465
01:10:44,711 --> 01:10:46,807
This is the longest day
of your life, Artie.

1466
01:10:54,555 --> 01:10:55,955
Run! Run!

1467
01:11:01,695 --> 01:11:03,027
Home! Home!

1468
01:11:03,864 --> 01:11:05,163
Run, Dennis! Run!

1469
01:11:10,972 --> 01:11:12,338
Jeez!

1470
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,470
Oh, God.

1471
01:11:16,377 --> 01:11:17,402
I'm good.

1472
01:11:19,213 --> 01:11:21,046
Come on, Dennis.
Come on, Dennis.

1473
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:24,484
You're out!

1474
01:11:25,787 --> 01:11:27,346
And who's got a Percoset?

1475
01:11:28,857 --> 01:11:30,223
All right, here we go!

1476
01:11:30,291 --> 01:11:33,320
All right. That's me, right at!

1477
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:36,755
Fucking asshole.

1478
01:11:37,899 --> 01:11:39,060
You're out!

1479
01:11:39,133 --> 01:11:40,500
Ba_ly rules!

1480
01:11:41,636 --> 01:11:43,161
Come on, Bobby.
Place it.

1481
01:11:47,742 --> 01:11:48,835
Asshole.

1482
01:11:50,379 --> 01:11:52,872
God, I'm glad Dirt
ain't around to see this.

1483
01:11:53,515 --> 01:11:55,606
You're out!

1484
01:11:56,151 --> 01:11:57,176
You're out.

1485
01:12:01,256 --> 01:12:02,815
Thought the tank was empty.

1486
01:12:03,058 --> 01:12:04,526
- They keep doing this to themselves.
- I know. Here you go.

1487
01:12:04,592 --> 01:12:06,028
- Here you go, guys, coffee.
- Help yourselves.

1488
01:12:06,495 --> 01:12:08,590
Thanks a lot.
Jimmy needed this.

1489
01:12:08,663 --> 01:12:09,757
Yeah, coffee.

1490
01:12:10,265 --> 01:12:11,631
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

1491
01:12:12,735 --> 01:12:13,725
You smell like booze.

1492
01:12:13,802 --> 01:12:15,431
- It gets you hot, though.
- Actually, it does.

1493
01:12:15,504 --> 01:12:16,666
Thanks for the coffee, honey.

1494
01:12:16,739 --> 01:12:19,403
10-O. They're killing us.
Last at bat.

1495
01:12:19,474 --> 01:12:20,568
I'm sory.

1496
01:12:20,809 --> 01:12:22,301
- Hey, Gina.
- Hey, Artie.

1497
01:12:23,078 --> 01:12:25,139
I'm really sory about missing
your wedding.

1498
01:12:25,381 --> 01:12:26,815
Listen, don't wory about it.

1499
01:12:26,882 --> 01:12:29,376
You not showing up
was the best gift I got.

1500
01:12:29,452 --> 01:12:31,581
The only disaster
was Johnny's toast.

1501
01:12:31,887 --> 01:12:33,413
What?
He said it went great.

1502
01:12:33,689 --> 01:12:38,791
So to recap, throughout it all there's
been a lot of laughter and a few tears.

1503
01:12:38,861 --> 01:12:42,858
But in the end, the clouds parted,
the sun shined down...

1504
01:12:42,932 --> 01:12:46,235
and the good Lord himself
decided it was meant to be.

1505
01:12:46,469 --> 01:12:50,307
That's how I finished
the regular season batting.706.

1506
01:12:50,606 --> 01:12:51,574
Salud.

1507
01:12:52,275 --> 01:12:53,436
What do we say, Dennis?

1508
01:12:53,509 --> 01:12:54,978
Come on, Dennis.
We're right behind you.

1509
01:12:55,545 --> 01:12:56,478
Out.

1510
01:12:56,846 --> 01:12:59,579
Damn, now bourbon,
tequila and coffee.

1511
01:12:59,783 --> 01:13:00,876
Two away!

1512
01:13:01,985 --> 01:13:03,544
DeVanzo shift!

1513
01:13:05,789 --> 01:13:07,087
Well, you're down 10-O...

1514
01:13:07,156 --> 01:13:09,492
and you're going to make
your team's last out ever.

1515
01:13:09,726 --> 01:13:11,217
How's that feel, alcoholic?

1516
01:13:12,228 --> 01:13:15,724
Hury up and pitch, asshole.
I'm losing my buzz.

1517
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:19,399
What do you say, Artie?
What do you say?

1518
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:20,438
Hey, Artie?

1519
01:13:20,504 --> 01:13:21,437
What?

1520
01:13:23,039 --> 01:13:24,064
Come here.

1521
01:13:24,741 --> 01:13:26,608
Hey, Linda.

1522
01:13:27,744 --> 01:13:31,650
Hey, sweetie.
How's it going? What's up?

1523
01:13:32,015 --> 01:13:33,644
Artie, you're a fucking ierk.

1524
01:13:33,717 --> 01:13:34,650
I know.

1525
01:13:34,718 --> 01:13:37,451
Unfortunately, that seems to be
my go-to move.

1526
01:13:39,490 --> 01:13:41,016
But I really miss you.

1527
01:13:41,525 --> 01:13:42,926
I miss you too.

1528
01:13:44,028 --> 01:13:45,724
You want to talk after the game?

1529
01:13:45,797 --> 01:13:48,165
Let's talk now
and make this jerk-offs wait.

1530
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:49,232
Hey, Linda?

1531
01:13:49,533 --> 01:13:52,004
I'll meet you in my office
at the gym after the game.

1532
01:13:52,369 --> 01:13:54,202
Shut the fuck up, Needle Dick!

1533
01:13:54,271 --> 01:13:55,638
And thanks for the herpes!

1534
01:13:58,342 --> 01:14:00,905
- Ball bag.
- What an asshole.

1535
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:03,005
- Asshole.
- Jerk-off.

1536
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:05,711
This town is 980/o skanks.

1537
01:14:08,019 --> 01:14:09,283
That's my girl.

1538
01:14:10,254 --> 01:14:11,655
Let's go. Batter up!

1539
01:14:11,856 --> 01:14:13,826
- I'll see you after the game, all right?
- Okay.

1540
01:14:16,093 --> 01:14:17,187
Bye.

1541
01:14:17,262 --> 01:14:20,098
- Come on.
- Come on!

1542
01:14:20,165 --> 01:14:22,897
Get the fuck in, you lazy fuck.

1543
01:14:22,967 --> 01:14:24,527
Classy broad you got there, bro.

1544
01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:26,734
Thanks, Needle Dick.

1545
01:14:27,839 --> 01:14:30,140
Put it up there, Dennis.
He can't hit it.

1546
01:14:30,208 --> 01:14:32,804
- Come on.
- Here we go. Here we go.

1547
01:14:33,545 --> 01:14:34,478
No.

1548
01:14:37,215 --> 01:14:39,014
- Yeah. Get out.
- Come on!

1549
01:14:40,819 --> 01:14:41,787
- Yeah!
- What?

1550
01:14:41,854 --> 01:14:42,879
Fuck!

1551
01:14:44,056 --> 01:14:44,989
Yeah!

1552
01:14:45,223 --> 01:14:46,350
Yeah!

1553
01:14:48,259 --> 01:14:49,627
Hell of a shot, bro!

1554
01:14:49,995 --> 01:14:53,992
Son of a bitch, motherfucker,
bastard, asshole!

1555
01:14:54,533 --> 01:14:55,592
Nice shot, Artie.

1556
01:14:55,834 --> 01:14:58,066
Hey, you assholes
knock that off...

1557
01:14:58,136 --> 01:15:00,231
or I'm revoking
your gym memberships!

1558
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,008
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1559
01:15:05,878 --> 01:15:07,177
Yeah!

1560
01:15:08,447 --> 01:15:09,938
Yeah!

1561
01:15:12,185 --> 01:15:14,314
- Nice shot!
- That's right!

1562
01:15:14,553 --> 01:15:16,489
At least you got some revenge
on that prick Manganelli...

1563
01:15:16,555 --> 01:15:18,081
even if we're not going to win.

1564
01:15:18,157 --> 01:15:20,491
What the fuck are you talking about?
We're going to win.

1565
01:15:20,559 --> 01:15:22,860
Art, it's 10-1.
We're down to our last out.

1566
01:15:22,929 --> 01:15:23,862
I don't give a fuck.

1567
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:26,366
Anyone who thinks we're going to lose
can go home right now!

1568
01:15:26,532 --> 01:15:27,796
Hey, calm down, will you?

1569
01:15:27,867 --> 01:15:29,597
Would Dirt calm down
if he were here?

1570
01:15:29,669 --> 01:15:32,299
No. After my homer he would have
thrown a bat at my head...

1571
01:15:32,371 --> 01:15:34,307
for not running
around the bases harder.

1572
01:15:34,373 --> 01:15:38,336
Now this is the last inning. Let's get
some runs and take that fucking troll!

1573
01:15:38,411 --> 01:15:39,812
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1574
01:15:45,552 --> 01:15:46,520
Come on now!

1575
01:15:49,155 --> 01:15:51,148
Nice! Nice going, Maz!

1576
01:15:51,691 --> 01:15:53,854
Run, you motherfucker!
Nice! Nice!

1577
01:15:58,531 --> 01:15:59,465
All right.

1578
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,531
Come on, Dave.
What do you say?

1579
01:16:02,802 --> 01:16:05,672
Come on, Dave.
Let's go.

1580
01:16:05,739 --> 01:16:07,641
- Come on, bring it!
- Yeah, that's right.

1581
01:16:08,308 --> 01:16:09,742
Yeah! Yeah!

1582
01:16:09,809 --> 01:16:12,406
Holy shit, Dave got a hit.
Holy living Christ.

1583
01:16:18,285 --> 01:16:19,378
Lucky shot.

1584
01:16:19,754 --> 01:16:20,744
Come on, Albert.

1585
01:16:21,188 --> 01:16:22,349
Yeah!

1586
01:16:23,257 --> 01:16:24,156
Come on!

1587
01:16:24,224 --> 01:16:25,853
- Shit!
- Cocksucker!

1588
01:16:26,761 --> 01:16:27,694
Damn!

1589
01:16:27,795 --> 01:16:29,354
Now we're looking like a team!

1590
01:16:30,598 --> 01:16:31,463
Yeah!

1591
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:34,735
Stay on the bag, Dave.

1592
01:16:35,903 --> 01:16:38,374
Come on, guys. Keep it going.
Let's go! Come on!

1593
01:16:38,439 --> 01:16:39,532
Come on, Daryl.

1594
01:16:40,107 --> 01:16:41,269
Nice swing.

1595
01:16:42,443 --> 01:16:44,743
Run!
Run, Dave, come on!

1596
01:16:44,812 --> 01:16:46,941
It's a gapper!
It's a gapper, come on!

1597
01:16:50,651 --> 01:16:51,846
Shit!

1598
01:16:54,355 --> 01:16:55,414
Asshole!

1599
01:16:55,589 --> 01:16:57,925
Yes! Get me a beer, somebody,
come on!

1600
01:16:58,526 --> 01:16:59,927
You're up, you're up, you're up.

1601
01:17:00,261 --> 01:17:01,924
Yeah! Yeah!

1602
01:17:04,165 --> 01:17:05,155
What do you say, Dave?

1603
01:17:05,233 --> 01:17:08,171
Nice! Like a gazelle, buddy!
Like a gazelle running out there.

1604
01:17:08,236 --> 01:17:10,103
What do you say, Alfonse?
Come on, one time!

1605
01:17:10,171 --> 01:17:11,434
We need you, buddy!

1606
01:17:14,242 --> 01:17:15,734
Nice, Alphonse!
Run!

1607
01:17:15,811 --> 01:17:18,338
Run, you sweaty Guido!
Run! Come on!

1608
01:17:19,247 --> 01:17:20,237
Yeah!

1609
01:17:25,487 --> 01:17:27,251
Tim, get out there.
Come on, we need you, buddy.

1610
01:17:27,323 --> 01:17:29,316
Run, run!
Do this, you sweaty...

1611
01:17:29,924 --> 01:17:30,858
9Uy.

1612
01:17:32,494 --> 01:17:34,327
Sweet! Sweet! Run!

1613
01:17:34,396 --> 01:17:36,992
Run, you crazy motherfucker!
Run, come on!

1614
01:17:37,065 --> 01:17:39,730
There you go, man!

1615
01:17:40,402 --> 01:17:41,870
One time, Johnny.

1616
01:17:41,936 --> 01:17:44,067
Hey, Manganelli,
you're looking good, shitnuts.

1617
01:17:44,139 --> 01:17:46,508
We're rocking you,
you pansy ass.

1618
01:17:47,609 --> 01:17:48,873
It's so unfair.

1619
01:17:48,944 --> 01:17:50,847
It's like pitching
to a healthy Lou Gehrig.

1620
01:17:54,283 --> 01:17:55,216
Yeah!

1621
01:17:55,351 --> 01:17:56,284
Fuck!

1622
01:17:58,287 --> 01:18:00,450
Let's go! Get it in here!

1623
01:18:08,364 --> 01:18:09,833
DeVanzo shift.

1624
01:18:11,367 --> 01:18:13,634
We're one out away
from the championship.

1625
01:18:13,870 --> 01:18:15,499
Force at any base.

1626
01:18:16,539 --> 01:18:18,098
One more bum and they're done.

1627
01:18:18,173 --> 01:18:20,543
You pricks stay awake out there,
God damn it.

1628
01:18:20,777 --> 01:18:23,442
Don't wory about the shift, Art.
We're down 10-6.

1629
01:18:23,513 --> 01:18:25,506
Just put it over the wall,
we tie it up. Let's go!

1630
01:18:25,582 --> 01:18:27,609
Come on, Artie!
Give it a ride, brother. Come on!

1631
01:18:27,683 --> 01:18:29,677
Come on, big stick up there, Artie.
Let's go!

1632
01:18:29,752 --> 01:18:30,981
You can beat this guy.

1633
01:18:31,254 --> 01:18:32,222
He fucking blows.

1634
01:18:33,290 --> 01:18:34,781
Your attention, please.

1635
01:18:35,225 --> 01:18:36,625
Ladies and gentlemen...

1636
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:39,690
now pitching for Manganelli...

1637
01:18:39,762 --> 01:18:42,325
number one, Needle Dick.

1638
01:18:43,733 --> 01:18:45,761
- Number one.
- Yeah, all right.

1639
01:18:45,836 --> 01:18:46,997
Needle Dick.

1640
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:49,906
Shut the fuck up!
Your luck's run out, DeVanzo.

1641
01:18:49,973 --> 01:18:52,535
This is your last at bat
in this league forever!

1642
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:54,739
I'm going to have to remodel
the window of my gym...

1643
01:18:54,812 --> 01:18:57,374
to fit that fifth trophy,
but fuck it, right?

1644
01:18:57,447 --> 01:18:58,380
Let's go!

1645
01:18:58,448 --> 01:19:01,181
For the last time,
you're not getting that trophy.

1646
01:19:01,952 --> 01:19:03,922
Come on, hit it out, baby!

1647
01:19:04,154 --> 01:19:05,623
Come on, hit it out, fuckhead!

1648
01:19:06,222 --> 01:19:10,221
Prepare to continue you lifetime
losing streak, jerk-off.

1649
01:19:10,694 --> 01:19:11,821
Bring it on.

1650
01:19:11,895 --> 01:19:13,922
Stay cool, Artie.
Stay cool.

1651
01:19:14,165 --> 01:19:16,658
Let's go.
Let's go.

1652
01:19:16,733 --> 01:19:17,667
Come on, Dennis.

1653
01:19:18,269 --> 01:19:19,396
Let's go.

1654
01:19:20,804 --> 01:19:21,772
Yeah!

1655
01:19:22,306 --> 01:19:23,239
Yeah!

1656
01:19:24,608 --> 01:19:26,703
Come on, show what you can do.
Get the ball!

1657
01:19:26,777 --> 01:19:28,246
Hury. Come on!

1658
01:19:28,312 --> 01:19:29,575
Come on, run!

1659
01:19:29,713 --> 01:19:32,446
Hury! Let's go! Run!

1660
01:19:32,516 --> 01:19:34,247
Get the fucking ball!

1661
01:19:36,553 --> 01:19:37,487
Yeah!

1662
01:19:37,588 --> 01:19:39,182
Artie, run! Run!

1663
01:19:41,192 --> 01:19:42,923
Come on, throw it!

1664
01:19:43,895 --> 01:19:45,797
Home! Home!

1665
01:19:46,831 --> 01:19:47,799
Come on, Artie.

1666
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:50,233
Shit!

1667
01:19:50,301 --> 01:19:51,291
Get it!

1668
01:19:52,136 --> 01:19:53,969
Score, Artie, score!
You're going to score!

1669
01:19:54,071 --> 01:19:55,267
- Dive!
- Dive!

1670
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:56,501
- Dive!
- Dive!

1671
01:19:56,574 --> 01:19:58,100
- Dive!
- Dive!

1672
01:20:06,651 --> 01:20:07,641
You're out!

1673
01:20:09,121 --> 01:20:10,054
God!

1674
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:11,989
Shit!

1675
01:20:14,359 --> 01:20:16,556
Yeah, you're the one, baby!

1676
01:20:17,029 --> 01:20:17,928
Hey, you all right?

1677
01:20:19,431 --> 01:20:20,729
Yeah, I'm all right.

1678
01:20:21,166 --> 01:20:22,327
It was a hell of a game.

1679
01:20:22,567 --> 01:20:24,161
Good hustle.
Great shit.

1680
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:26,604
Hey, guys,
this can't be our last game.

1681
01:20:26,671 --> 01:20:28,231
Let's go play in Parsippany
new year.

1682
01:20:28,306 --> 01:20:29,240
- I'm in.
- Yeah!

1683
01:20:29,307 --> 01:20:31,437
- Me too, man.
- Let's do it.

1684
01:20:34,213 --> 01:20:35,442
You know what?
Fuck it. You're right.

1685
01:20:35,515 --> 01:20:37,985
We got to play again new year.
I'm in! I'm in!

1686
01:20:38,050 --> 01:20:39,143
Let's go get drunk.

1687
01:20:39,218 --> 01:20:42,019
That sounds great, but there's
one thing I gotta do first.

1688
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:44,182
Hey, Linda, pull the car around.

1689
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:45,418
Okay, Artie.

1690
01:20:49,462 --> 01:20:50,555
My dear Lord.

1691
01:20:52,698 --> 01:20:54,668
- We did it!
- We won!

1692
01:20:54,734 --> 01:20:56,829
- We're the best!
- Hurray!

1693
01:20:56,902 --> 01:20:58,804
Get a photographer over here!

1694
01:20:58,871 --> 01:21:00,340
Take a picture of the champs.

1695
01:21:00,406 --> 01:21:01,806
Yeah, let's get a photogra...

1696
01:21:03,944 --> 01:21:05,276
Get that fat fuck!

1697
01:21:05,344 --> 01:21:06,677
Artie, what the fuck are you doing?

1698
01:21:07,447 --> 01:21:09,280
DeVanzo, you're dead this time!

1699
01:21:09,348 --> 01:21:10,408
Let's go, Linda.

1700
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:13,086
I want that piece of shit killed.

1701
01:21:13,152 --> 01:21:15,954
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Go. See you at the gym, fellows!

1702
01:21:16,655 --> 01:21:18,421
Come back here,
you fucking loser.

1703
01:21:19,325 --> 01:21:21,454
That was the greatest
asshole move ever.

1704
01:21:21,527 --> 01:21:22,826
Absolutely.

1705
01:21:23,362 --> 01:21:25,834
God help DeVanzo
when I get my hands on him.

1706
01:21:26,466 --> 01:21:28,368
Hey! Hey, kid!

1707
01:21:30,003 --> 01:21:31,666
What the helI do you think
you're doing?

1708
01:21:31,905 --> 01:21:34,171
Just updating your photo,
Mayor Herpes.

1709
01:21:37,344 --> 01:21:39,507
- Shit!
- Come back here, you little brat!

1710
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:42,518
Help! This maniac
is tying to give me fucking herpes.

1711
01:21:42,583 --> 01:21:44,108
Come back here, you wise-ass.

1712
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:49,683
I told that prick
he wasn't get that trophy.

1713
01:21:49,756 --> 01:21:51,521
You're such a pisser, Artie.

1714
01:21:51,792 --> 01:21:53,728
What are you going to do
with that crazy thing?

1715
01:21:53,794 --> 01:21:55,890
You know what?
Drive over Manganelli's gym.

1716
01:21:55,963 --> 01:21:58,263
I'll put a note on the trophy
saying I'm sory...

1717
01:21:58,332 --> 01:22:00,529
and then I'll throw it
through his front fucking window.

1718
01:22:00,901 --> 01:22:03,099
God, Artie,
please, don't do that.

1719
01:22:03,670 --> 01:22:04,900
I was just kidding.

1720
01:22:05,172 --> 01:22:06,470
Hey, let's pawn it in Newa_...

1721
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:08,237
then go down the shore
and get cheese sticks.

1722
01:22:08,509 --> 01:22:10,479
- Count me in.
- All right.

1723
01:22:32,733 --> 01:22:34,795
Excuse me. Hi.
I'm sory.

1724
01:22:34,869 --> 01:22:36,133
Do you know what time it is?

1725
01:22:36,737 --> 01:22:38,071
Do you know what time it is?

1726
01:22:39,541 --> 01:22:40,941
- I guess I do.
- Yes.

1727
01:22:42,177 --> 01:22:43,167
Wow!

1728
01:22:43,545 --> 01:22:46,210
Those are really pretty
colo_ul shoes you got there.

1729
01:22:46,848 --> 01:22:48,910
And they show off
your colorful nails.

1730
01:22:49,351 --> 01:22:50,341
Thanks.

1731
01:22:51,419 --> 01:22:52,580
Hey, do you like music?

1732
01:22:53,989 --> 01:22:55,423
Who doesn't like music?

1733
01:22:56,058 --> 01:22:58,028
That's true.
Do you like rock music?

1734
01:22:58,560 --> 01:22:59,756
I could take it or leave it.

1735
01:23:00,328 --> 01:23:02,629
Because my friend band,
I know the guitar from this band...

1736
01:23:02,698 --> 01:23:04,098
and they're playing later.

1737
01:23:04,166 --> 01:23:05,965
I think I can get you
on the guest list.

1738
01:23:06,702 --> 01:23:08,034
And we could split
the other ticket or...

1739
01:23:08,103 --> 01:23:11,234
Hey, beat it, dirtbag.
Get lost.

1740
01:23:13,274 --> 01:23:14,265
Did you want to go?

1741
01:23:14,510 --> 01:23:16,776
What the fuck?
Get lost.

1742
01:23:17,779 --> 01:23:19,545
- Jesus.
- Jesus Christ.

1743
01:23:19,781 --> 01:23:22,345
I'm gone for like two minutes
and they're like vultures.

1744
01:23:22,418 --> 01:23:24,251
Two minutes?
You're gone for 20 minutes.

1745
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,654
The line on the cheese steak
was like an hour long.

1746
01:23:26,722 --> 01:23:28,248
I'm sory.
You want a bite?

1747
01:23:29,092 --> 01:23:30,617
- Have a bite. Come on.
- All right.

1748
01:23:33,963 --> 01:23:35,192
What do you say, batter?

1749
01:23:36,532 --> 01:23:38,764
Batter to DeVanzo at first.
He's got it. Up with it.

1750
01:23:40,436 --> 01:23:42,633
Here. Down here.
Here. Here.

1751
01:23:42,705 --> 01:23:44,504
Two. Deuce. One time.

1752
01:23:47,376 --> 01:23:48,936
That's nothing but fun there.

1753
01:23:49,445 --> 01:23:50,378
He's got it.

1754
01:23:54,984 --> 01:23:56,077
One time now.

1755
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,390
Established. Here.
Clear. Here.

1756
01:23:59,456 --> 01:24:00,822
Clear it. Two.

1757
01:24:07,931 --> 01:24:09,730
Fire it in there.
Fire it in!

1758
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:11,190
One time.

1759
01:24:12,068 --> 01:24:13,537
Look alive there. Two.

1760
01:24:14,104 --> 01:24:16,904
Establishment. Here.
Here.

1761
01:24:17,807 --> 01:24:18,775
Hey, now!

1762
01:24:27,284 --> 01:24:28,217
Bitch.

1763
01:24:28,752 --> 01:24:32,624
- Complete jerk-off.
- ''I want to be honest with it.

1764
01:24:32,689 --> 01:24:34,625
I want to be honest
with my wife.''

1765
01:24:34,692 --> 01:24:36,160
- Shut the fuck up.
- Asshole.

1766
01:24:36,226 --> 01:24:37,786
This Danish is stale.

1767
01:24:39,562 --> 01:24:43,162
The happiest day of my life is
gonna be when you finally have a kid.

1768
01:24:43,567 --> 01:24:45,366
God bless, that means
I got laid at least once.

1769
01:24:55,346 --> 01:24:59,149
Laying down a bunt is like
holding your dick and putting it in.

1770
01:24:59,217 --> 01:25:00,685
Okay? Softly.

1771
01:25:04,122 --> 01:25:06,354
Hey, mom,
do we have Fluffernutter?

1772
01:25:08,226 --> 01:25:10,822
- Mom!
- I'm looking!

1773
01:25:10,894 --> 01:25:15,269
Fluffernutter! See if we have any
Fluffernutter! She's losing her hearing.

1774
01:25:15,466 --> 01:25:17,026
I'm wory about her healthy.

1775
01:25:18,336 --> 01:25:20,773
You know, the happiest days...

1776
01:25:20,839 --> 01:25:22,034
''Happy Days''?
You were on ''Happy Days''?

1777
01:25:22,106 --> 01:25:23,632
- Yes, I was. I'm Chachi.
- Okay.

1778
01:25:23,942 --> 01:25:24,739
Line.

1779
01:25:24,810 --> 01:25:26,643
- A priest and a rabbi...
- No, no, no.

1780
01:25:28,313 --> 01:25:29,942
- A...
- No, no, no.

1781
01:25:31,482 --> 01:25:32,917
What are you doing?

1782
01:25:33,151 --> 01:25:35,314
- What's this line?
- Yep, yep, yep, yep.

1783
01:25:35,453 --> 01:25:36,421
Is that the line?

1784
01:25:36,488 --> 01:25:37,888
I have no idea.

1785
01:25:38,122 --> 01:25:39,990
That's the Jersey City salute?

1786
01:25:40,058 --> 01:25:43,725
That's the Jersey City salute
to Manganelli, sweetheart!

1787
01:25:43,795 --> 01:25:44,763
Your shitnuts!
