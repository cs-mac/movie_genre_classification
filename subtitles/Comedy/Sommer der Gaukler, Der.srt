Episode 2

4
00:00:16,813 --> 00:00:19,109
A body's postmortem...

5
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:23,400
does not in any way signify
violating a person's dignity.

6
00:00:23,535 --> 00:00:28,700
On the contrary, as such body
is bestowed upon the altar of noble learning,

7
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,150
the dead are vested with a most
honorable opportunity to achieve fame.

8
00:00:33,972 --> 00:00:36,130
Today,

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,760
we shall ascertain
the location of the internal organs.

10
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:45,723
<i>We shall cut down the
skin near the diaphragm.</i>

11
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:04,925
Man's body is sacred, even after
the soul leaves its physical form.

12
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:09,322
Violating the essence of man
in such a degrading way...

13
00:01:10,134 --> 00:01:13,551
feels like dishonoring
our own souls.

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,954
Hey. Hearing the scorn the Japanese
show for all the Joseon students...

15
00:01:17,081 --> 00:01:20,320
who refuse to participate in
autopsy classes is no better.

16
00:01:20,804 --> 00:01:24,447
Isn't one of the reasons why
we fell behind the Japanese...

17
00:01:24,482 --> 00:01:28,169
our refusal to learn
practical science such as that?

18
00:01:28,638 --> 00:01:30,758
Are you all right?

19
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,098
I don't know.

20
00:01:36,613 --> 00:01:40,569
I don't know if this is
truly the path I must take.

21
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,661
Are you saying you'll stop
studying medicine?

22
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:44,734
I don't know.

23
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,624
I need to go, see you around.

24
00:01:55,364 --> 00:01:57,953
I'm hearing strange rumors.

25
00:01:58,312 --> 00:02:00,980
They say there will be a demonstration
against Japanese occupation,

26
00:02:01,106 --> 00:02:04,022
looks like he's involved
in some way or form.

27
00:02:06,174 --> 00:02:10,028
<i>Our people appeal to Japan
and the world's powers for...</i>

28
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,599
the opportunity to manifest
our own self-determination.

29
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:20,300
Should we encounter any obstacle in
our freedom-seeking activities,

30
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,810
for the sake of our survival and freedom,
we shall seek independence by force.

31
00:02:33,864 --> 00:02:38,346
No matter what you think of us,
we are Joseon people, too.

32
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:41,166
Preparations for our
demonstration are going well.

33
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,850
You students of the
Gyeongseong Medical College will...

34
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,750
take care of writing our manifesto.

35
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:52,741
<i>- Independence for our people, Hurrah!
- Hurrah!</i>

- Hurrah!

42
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:27,040
Do you know what this
place is, to enter like that?

43
00:03:27,054 --> 00:03:30,508
I know all too well,
so don't waste my time.

44
00:03:31,606 --> 00:03:34,706
How have you been?

45
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:39,915
You little...
get out of here right now!

46
00:03:43,024 --> 00:03:44,985
What is all this commotion?

47
00:03:50,091 --> 00:03:52,037
What brings you here?

48
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:55,860
I came to show you
how grateful I am, Milady.

49
00:03:55,984 --> 00:04:00,586
Thanks to your sending me to prison,
I even learned Japanese,

50
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:03,943
and I found a career
for myself, didn't I?

51
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:06,248
You brought me success,

52
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,183
so I should at least
show you my gratitude.

53
00:04:08,323 --> 00:04:11,169
If that's what you're here for, I
don't need any gratitude, so leave.

54
00:04:11,993 --> 00:04:15,842
Have you heard the
news from Gyeongseong?

55
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:22,940
In Gyeongseong, this "independence
movement" or something took place.

56
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:25,359
Those students refuse
to fulfill their duties,

57
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:30,946
and started infesting the streets,
participating in this demonstration.

58
00:04:32,609 --> 00:04:36,867
They think a few fools on the
street will bring us independence.

59
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,372
They must have some
kind of death wish.

60
00:04:40,507 --> 00:04:42,285
<i>Ahhh... right!</i>

61
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:46,232
<i>I hear the Young Master is attending
a Medical College in Gyeongseong?</i>

62
00:04:47,142 --> 00:04:50,183
Then again, would a boy
from a rich and noble family...

63
00:04:50,461 --> 00:04:52,895
waste his life on something like that?

64
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:55,576
<i>Isn't that right, Milady?</i>

65
00:05:02,877 --> 00:05:06,870
So, until we meet again.

68
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,117
He's not the kind of boy to
engage in such imprudent acts.

69
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,799
Indeed.

70
00:05:24,514 --> 00:05:26,404

00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:22,423
Lee Kwon was caught,
so we're in danger as well.

85
00:07:22,544 --> 00:07:25,072
Let's part ways here,
and hide somewhere else.

86
00:07:26,616 --> 00:07:27,693
Be careful.

87
00:07:27,786 --> 00:07:31,250
Right.
You too!

88
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:37,070
- Here!
- Yes!

89
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:56,699
Where is he, your son?

90
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,973
In Gyeongseong.

91
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,653
I told you he
disappeared from Gyeongseong!

92
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:09,266
He came here, didn't he?

93
00:08:09,392 --> 00:08:12,293
He's in Gyeongseong,
for all I know.

94
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:34,650
Fomenting impure ideological
slant towards the Great Japanese Empire...

95
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,740
is tantamount to high treason.

96
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:41,342
<i>He's not here!</i>

97
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:57,250
Anyone sheltering
such treacherous elements,

98
00:08:57,251 --> 00:08:59,099
or even only helping them escape...

99
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:05,353
shall be convicted of
felony against the Empire.

100

- Yes!

101
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:13,869
We shall meet again, Milady.

102
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:19,741
That...
that motherless scum!

103
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,621
<i>How can you show
such behavior to her?</i>

104
00:09:23,017 --> 00:09:24,728
<i>You still think of me as a servant?</i>

105
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,467
If I can only capture
one of those fools,

106
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,858
then our days will be filled
with riches and fame.

107
00:09:31,123 --> 00:09:34,368
I'll catch him,
and achieve success.

my benefit any time.

I brought him to a safe place.

before they find him there.

120
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,882
He must cross the border.

121
00:10:18,256 --> 00:10:22,550
Surveillance is so tight,
can he even make it safely?

122

Even if he does go, if they
find him crossing the border...

Forgive my brother
for his despicable acts.

130
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,671
I have no desire
to hear you say that.

131
00:11:12,795 --> 00:11:15,384
You must help him escape!

132
00:11:15,493 --> 00:11:17,620
My brother is not
going to stop at this.

133

Help him escape...

How are you going to help escape

00:12:06,288 --> 00:12:07,659
No.

142
00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:10,811
Let's go.
You must run away.

143
00:12:10,953 --> 00:12:13,463
We heard surveillance is
limited in the upper Amnok.

144
00:12:13,572 --> 00:12:17,599
Cross the river, go to China and
then head for wherever you wish to go.

Did you lure me
here to help them?

Our father died because
of those damned Japanese!

151
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:18,842
How can you work for them?

152
00:13:19,843 --> 00:13:22,931
Surviving made me like this!

153
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:26,830
I couldn't live, nor
die like a decent person,

00:13:26,942 --> 00:13:29,374
so here I am!

155

I will catch him at all costs!

00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:09,231
<i>Hurry up.</i>

159
00:14:12,681 --> 00:14:14,753
I am sorry.

160
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:22,854
Whenever I think of you,
I just feel sorry about everything.

161
00:14:23,115 --> 00:14:26,289
I will ask you just this much.

162
00:14:27,922 --> 00:14:31,062
What...

163
00:14:31,165 --> 00:14:34,567
do I mean to you?

164
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:40,619
Whatever I mean to you,

165
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,350
just remember this.

166
00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:52,756
That I will always be here for you.

167
00:14:57,843 --> 00:14:59,643
Just that...

168
00:15:01,387 --> 00:15:05,018
Never forget it.

169
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:24,162
Where did you hide him?

170
00:15:24,254 --> 00:15:25,518
What are you talking about?

171
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:29,841
Where did you send your spouse?!

172
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:32,962
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

173
00:15:36,032 --> 00:15:37,860
Get moving!

174
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:43,974
I caught him while
he tried to run away.

175
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,839
Speak.
Where is he?

176
00:16:05,113 --> 00:16:06,310
Mi Reuk.

177
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,743
You are no coward.

178
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:13,799
You did lose you courage once,

179
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,328
but you still kept
walking your path.

180
00:16:17,794 --> 00:16:20,447
I trust you.

181
00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:25,545
Indeed! The Mi Reuk
I know is not a coward.

182
00:16:25,663 --> 00:16:28,634
You will cross the river
and go past the border,

183
00:16:28,747 --> 00:16:31,182
and you finally will reach Europe.

184
00:16:31,301 --> 00:16:34,408
But, if I go...

185
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:37,373
What... what
will happen to you?

186
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:40,077
You needn't worry about me.

187
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:44,536
I will quietly wait
for your safe return.

188
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:46,683
Doesn't time fly?

189
00:16:46,808 --> 00:16:47,682
Mother!

190
00:16:47,795 --> 00:16:54,284
Should you not be able
to ever make it back here,

191
00:16:54,406 --> 00:16:57,480
you shan't fall into despair.

192
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,695
Raising you as
my child all this time,

193
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,542
I have been blessed with happiness.

194
00:17:06,948 --> 00:17:10,944
You gave me the kind of joy...

195
00:17:11,085 --> 00:17:15,481
nothing else in the world
would be able to.

196
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:22,735
Now, walk on your path.
Don't think of your mother.

197
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:27,591
You must walk that path alone.

198
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:54,526
Hurry up!

199
00:19:03,324 --> 00:19:05,992

It's a good book for learning German.
It's written with simplicity and candor.

220
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:13,476
You're too quiet.

221
00:21:13,598 --> 00:21:16,083
You must be spending

<i>In Asia, silence
is considered a virtue,</i>

223

but it's different in the west.

224
00:21:21,383 --> 00:21:24,334
They consider it
antisocial and haughty.

225

Try to spend time and socialize

Mi Reuk!

00:22:45,328 --> 00:22:47,125
Come in.

00:22:50,926 --> 00:22:54,177
Brother,
I beg you pardon.

236
00:22:57,045 --> 00:23:00,447
I don't understand this passage.

237
00:23:02,611 --> 00:23:04,111
Is anything wrong?

238
00:23:05,373 --> 00:23:08,445
I don't know what's
wrong with me either.

239
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:11,598
First I felt a strange
sensation in my chest,

240
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,333
and now even my stomach hurts.

241
00:23:17,634 --> 00:23:20,852
Your hands are cold.

242
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,034
Do you feel nauseous?

243
00:23:23,145 --> 00:23:25,950
Yes, it's been this way all morning.

244
00:23:26,264 --> 00:23:28,475
May I help you out?

245
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:55,077
It will only be a slight sting,
you needn't worry.

246
00:24:06,811 --> 00:24:08,182
I feel a little better.

247
00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:14,753
Oriental medicine is
based on the five elements theory.

248
00:24:15,443 --> 00:24:21,052
That is, wood, fire,
earth, metal and water.

249
00:24:22,024 --> 00:24:31,913
These five elements regulate
all the organs' activity in the human body.

250
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:34,412
Fascinating.

251
00:24:34,911 --> 00:24:38,510
You're well versed
in Oriental medicine,

252
00:24:38,618 --> 00:24:42,677
and even studied western
medicine in your motherland.

253
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:49,086
I think studying medicine here
in Germany would suit you perfectly.

254
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:53,298
You will become a very
esteemed and talented doctor.

255
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:20,339
Do you wash your hands
that way at home, too?

256
00:25:22,306 --> 00:25:23,023
Why?

257
00:25:23,118 --> 00:25:24,895
Your face and
body as well, I suppose.

258
00:25:24,989 --> 00:25:26,488
Yes. And?

259
00:25:26,689 --> 00:25:30,032
So why is your skin still so dirty?

260
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,793
Hey, I brought someone
from your hometown.

261
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,741
From my hometown?!

262
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,334
Are you a compatriot of mine?

263
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,334
{\a6}"C'est mon compatriote?"*

264
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,578
Why don't you talk to him?

265
00:26:00,683 --> 00:26:03,958
Speak your mother tongue, that is.

266
00:26:05,506 --> 00:26:10,978
Sadly, people from my hometown
and I speak a different dialect,

267
00:26:11,149 --> 00:26:19,277
just like you can't easily understand
what professors from other regions say.

268
00:26:20,856 --> 00:26:22,584
Isn't it?

269
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,310
<i>Elizabeth!
Don't run!</i>

270
00:26:30,092 --> 00:26:31,843
Are you all right?

271
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,876
Nothing to be afraid of.

272
00:26:36,001 --> 00:26:40,638
Because I come from another land,
the color of my skin is different.

273
00:26:41,118 --> 00:26:42,789
Do you understand?

274
00:26:44,147 --> 00:26:45,297
Thank you.

275
00:26:45,582 --> 00:26:49,875
Do all men from your hometown
have the same skin?

276
00:26:50,164 --> 00:26:51,322
Yes.

277
00:26:52,163 --> 00:26:55,282
Is it because they
don't drink enough milk?

278
00:26:57,185 --> 00:27:03,116
This land I come from
is a little country from the far east.

279
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:08,201
The people living there all
have dark hair and yellow skin.

280
00:27:08,297 --> 00:27:10,588
Ahhh... it must be the sun
that makes your skin yellow.

281
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:14,939
It takes a such a long time to
reach us it doesn't have enough power,

282
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:20,431
so we're all white.

283
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,784
Yes, probably.

284
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:26,627
I'm Elizabeth.

285
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:28,903
And my name is Mirok.

286
00:27:28,997 --> 00:27:30,464
Mirok?!

287
00:27:30,712 --> 00:27:37,838
Mirok means being
foolish but of good heart!

288
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,820
When I was
this little just like you,

289
00:27:43,103 --> 00:27:47,355
I must have looked like a fool,
but at least I looked kind,

290
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:52,285
so that's probably
why they called me that.

291
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:53,611
Uh?

292
00:27:54,535 --> 00:27:56,185
Fool!

293
00:28:01,135 --> 00:28:03,318
You can't pay the rent again?

294
00:28:03,423 --> 00:28:05,358
I apologize,

295
00:28:05,468 --> 00:28:07,760
I will pay as soon as I can.

296
00:28:07,874 --> 00:28:11,597
You haven't paid for two months,
this can't go on anymore.

297
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:14,005
<i>I'll only wait until
the end of this month,</i>

298
00:28:14,095 --> 00:28:16,029

00:28:25,534 --> 00:28:28,528
<i>Have you been well?</i>

301
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:33,448
<i>I'm wondering if the rest of
the family is healthy as well.</i>

302
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,720
<i>I'm doing fine.</i>

303
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:39,909
<i>We'll start practicing at the
hospital, beginning this month.</i>

304
00:28:40,015 --> 00:28:43,722
<i>They're all very kind to me,</i>

305
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:48,563
<i>and the owner of this
boarding house dotes on me like a mother.</i>

306
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,711
Throw everything out!

307
00:28:55,837 --> 00:28:59,752
From now on, this place will
be used by the Imperial Police.

308
00:29:00,658 --> 00:29:04,621
Erase any trace of the
traitors' shadows as well.

309
00:29:08,418 --> 00:29:11,298
<i>I'm glad you're doing well.</i>

310
00:29:11,424 --> 00:29:14,903
<i>We're doing fine.</i>

311
00:29:15,054 --> 00:29:21,372
<i>Our only concern is you,
living alone in such a far away land.</i>

312
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,891
<i>We recently moved.</i>

313
00:29:25,016 --> 00:29:28,323
<i>Our house started
languishing in its old age,</i>

314
00:29:28,444 --> 00:29:32,121
<i>so everything feels
fresh in this new house.</i>

315
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,303
<i>It's full of rooms and
with a very large yard,</i>

316
00:29:35,437 --> 00:29:38,017
<i>it makes you feel elated.</i>

317
00:29:38,408 --> 00:29:41,578
<i>So, you needn't worry about us,</i>

318
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:45,100
<i>and I wish you good health
and luck in your studies.</i>

319
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:59,110
This is not worth much,

320
00:29:59,235 --> 00:30:03,443
but that watch over
there would certainly be better.

321
00:30:03,444 --> 00:30:05,724
<i>Care to give me that?</i>

322
00:30:10,223 --> 00:30:15,225
<i>Looks like it's the same
for Oriental philosophers,</i>

323
00:30:14,284 --> 00:30:20,976
worrying about the
time even for promenades.

324
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:30,306
That's what Immanuel Kant did,
every single day.

325
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:34,112
He took a walk at the
same exact time every day,

326
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,708
so people said he was
trying to match his clock.

327
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,536
Can I introduce myself?

328
00:30:44,148 --> 00:30:45,783
My name is Rosa.

329
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:48,184
Mirok.

330
00:30:49,673 --> 00:30:51,085
Mirok Li.

331
00:30:51,211 --> 00:30:54,145
What does your name mean?

332
00:30:54,726 --> 00:31:02,462
{\A6}[*Mireuk = Maitreya]

333
00:30:54,726 --> 00:31:02,462
Mirok* in Buddhism is a future Buddha
who's come to save all men,

334
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:07,392
creating a peaceful world to live in.

335
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:14,018
That's the kind of peaceful
world you'll make, one day.

336
00:31:19,729 --> 00:31:23,183
You think I'm going to die?

337
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:24,785
Elizabeth!

338
00:31:24,818 --> 00:31:30,272
That's what the doctor
told me, Aunt Rosa.

339
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,244
No.

340
00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:33,459
That's not what I think.

341
00:31:34,818 --> 00:31:40,258
Whatever happens to me,
will you stay by my side?

342
00:31:40,355 --> 00:31:43,117
Of course I will.

343
00:31:44,562 --> 00:31:46,096
I'm not going anywhere.

344
00:31:46,203 --> 00:31:49,213
But you probably
will not be able to.

345
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,178
Why wouldn't I?

346
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:56,248
Because she likes
you more than I do.

347
00:31:59,507 --> 00:32:01,742
Elizabeth.

348
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:05,269
I really care about you.

349
00:32:47,453 --> 00:32:49,637
Stop!

350
00:33:04,177 --> 00:33:09,649
A friend of mine was shot
to death by Japanese troops.

351
00:33:11,069 --> 00:33:17,281
Another was arrested.
Before they could get me, I ran away,

352
00:33:17,624 --> 00:33:20,089
and came all the
way here to Germany.

353
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:28,680
Without even realizing it,
everything came back to mind.

354
00:33:36,605 --> 00:33:41,882
No one will harm you
here, it's a safe place.

355
00:34:19,826 --> 00:34:21,097
<i>Mother!</i>

356
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:23,143
Mother!

357
00:34:23,831 --> 00:34:25,890
Mother!
Are you all right?

358
00:34:25,995 --> 00:34:27,326
Mother!

359
00:34:53,637 --> 00:34:54,813
Please.

360
00:34:54,935 --> 00:34:56,217
You must save her.

361
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,852
The patient is already dead.

362
00:34:57,968 --> 00:35:00,583
But her hands are still warm!

363
00:35:00,692 --> 00:35:02,082
The machines don't lie.

364
00:35:02,191 --> 00:35:05,465
She's still alive,
her hands are warm!

365
00:35:05,574 --> 00:35:09,113
You're not suited to be a doctor.

366
00:35:09,226 --> 00:35:12,015
People who can't be
objective with their patients...

367
00:35:12,141 --> 00:35:14,637
are not qualified for this job.

368
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:09,454
Mother!

369
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:12,481
<i>Mother!</i>

370
00:36:12,623 --> 00:36:15,775
- Mother!
- <I>Mister Li!

371
00:36:31,794 --> 00:36:34,735
You're all burning.

372
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,595
I received a letter from home.

373
00:36:40,935 --> 00:36:43,512
My mother passed away.

374
00:37:56,268 --> 00:38:00,515
So you're leaving the hospital?

375
00:38:03,387 --> 00:38:08,545
<i>The human body is like
a small universe in itself,</i>

376
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,716
<i>a vessel embodying a man's soul,</i>

377
00:38:11,674 --> 00:38:15,784
<i>but nobody seems
interested about that here.</i>

378
00:38:18,456 --> 00:38:22,309
I think the path I'm walking
could lead me elsewhere.

379
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:27,411
Spiritual enlightenment is
much more important to me.

380
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:33,958
That's a relief.

381
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:39,184
{\a6}[*Munchen = Munich]

382
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:39,184
I'm leaving for Munchen*,
to study literature.

383
00:38:39,795 --> 00:38:41,972
See those gates?

384
00:38:42,096 --> 00:38:52,301
{\a6}[*Frederick V = King of Bohemia and
Elector Palatine of the Holy Roman Empire, 1596~1632*]

385
00:38:42,096 --> 00:38:43,481
It was commissioned
by Friedrich the Fifth*,

386
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:52,301
and built in a single night, to
make his consort Elizabeth happy.

387
00:38:54,607 --> 00:38:58,819
They say when lovers
pass through these gates,

388
00:39:00,201 --> 00:39:03,780
their love will
last a hundred years.

389
00:39:08,061 --> 00:39:11,851
Mirok, should we
pass through as well?

390
00:39:14,154 --> 00:39:16,698
Or maybe not.

391
00:39:16,823 --> 00:39:22,407
If we go through, we could
be a hundred years together.

392
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:27,010
But if we don't...

393
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:30,321
it could be forever.

394
00:39:36,734 --> 00:39:38,364
Mirok.

395
00:39:39,172 --> 00:39:42,981
Will you come to Munchen with me?

396
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:49,905
There, you can find the inspiration
to live life as you wish,

397
00:39:50,415 --> 00:39:54,066
to walk your own path.

398
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,000
Mi Reuk!

399
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:18,752
Jae Won.

400
00:40:18,782 --> 00:40:21,449
The applications for
publication end this month,

401
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:23,414
but I already
mentioned them your name.

402
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:25,601
Thank you,
but I'll have to decline.

403
00:40:25,712 --> 00:40:28,878
- Look.
- It's just that I wouldn't make it.

404
00:40:29,938 --> 00:40:32,078
I was writing something,
but haven't finished yet.

405
00:40:32,187 --> 00:40:36,536
Ahh... really, aren't you about
to be kicked out of that place?

406
00:40:42,338 --> 00:40:44,351
What are you writing?

407
00:40:46,787 --> 00:40:50,361
I'm trying to write
my first short story.

408
00:40:53,023 --> 00:40:54,413
What is it about?

409
00:40:56,751 --> 00:40:59,246
It's about a messenger from heaven.

410
00:41:00,471 --> 00:41:02,381
Do you mean angels?

411
00:41:21,164 --> 00:41:24,534
<i>Two poets were walking
the streets of Seoul one night,</i>

412
00:41:24,644 --> 00:41:28,876

voice coming from over the fence.</i>

{\a6}[*nyang = old Joseon monetary unit*]

414
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:32,786

415
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,592
<i>who had been

{\a6}[*10 don = 1 nyang*]

417
00:41:37,848 --> 00:41:41,021
<i>The older poet only had 7 don,*</i>

418
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,964
<i>so he threw what
he had over the fence.</i>

419
00:41:44,349 --> 00:41:47,258
<i>A few days later, the younger
poet passed there once again,</i>

420
00:41:47,362 --> 00:41:49,709
<i>and he heard that woman again.</i>

421
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:55,000
<i>She was still praying to the gods,
asking for just another 3 don.</i>

422
00:41:57,845 --> 00:42:02,804
<i>The young poet threw the 1
nyang he had over the fence.</i>

423
00:42:02,931 --> 00:42:06,612
<i>He was waiting to get
the difference back,</i>

424
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,389
<i>but all he heard was this woman,
still praying to the gods,</i>

425
00:42:10,685 --> 00:42:13,274
<i>saying she'd use the remaining
money to feed her son for a few days,</i>

426
00:42:13,381 --> 00:42:16,815
<i>after all that time starving.</i>

427
00:42:18,419 --> 00:42:22,445
<i>The young poet just
went home, smiling.</i>

428
00:42:24,269 --> 00:42:26,515
I love it.

429
00:42:30,174 --> 00:42:32,896
That messenger of heaven,

430
00:42:33,086 --> 00:42:36,046
I wish you had one by your side.

431
00:42:37,685 --> 00:42:41,336
Will other people like it?

432
00:42:42,707 --> 00:42:51,291
Will German people understand
and enjoy a story from the far east?

433
00:42:51,899 --> 00:42:57,308
I love you.

434
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,835
See? I understood.

435
00:43:03,354 --> 00:43:09,015
Just express your feelings,
with honesty and simplicity.

436
00:43:11,324 --> 00:43:17,225
Then, other people will understand
and interpret your feelings.

437
00:43:17,335 --> 00:43:19,186
Thank you, Rosa.

438
00:43:19,966 --> 00:43:21,871
Of course.

439
00:43:21,996 --> 00:43:26,382
You can love me, if you want.

440
00:43:26,487 --> 00:43:29,690
Your Korean has
gotten a lot better?!

441
00:43:31,948 --> 00:43:34,400
If I want to understand
what beats inside there,

442
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,339
I must do that.

443
00:44:01,522 --> 00:44:07,246
I thought there was no path
past this labyrinth of mountains and rivers.

444
00:44:07,365 --> 00:44:15,478
But I found a village of bright
flowers and the willows's shade.

445
00:44:18,317 --> 00:44:23,751
It's a poem about finding hope in
a village where flowers bloom,

446
00:44:25,578 --> 00:44:32,319
after enduring the despair
of losing one's path.

447

I am grateful
for your inviting me here.

How long has it been since
you've left your homeland?

454
00:45:10,571 --> 00:45:12,058
Over ten years.

455
00:45:15,018 --> 00:45:18,494
You must be really missing
your friends and family.

456
00:45:18,628 --> 00:45:21,664
Don't you feel lonely?

A pupil of the Oriental
philosoper Confucius...

465
00:46:20,104 --> 00:46:28,389
worried that, while everyone
had brethren, he was alone.

466
00:46:29,136 --> 00:46:32,459
<i>Confucius then said that,</i>

<i>all the world is your brethren.</i>

So why are you losing yourself in anxiety,
saying you have no brethren?

You and I,
