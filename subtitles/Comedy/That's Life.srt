00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,820
[Episode 15]

2
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,640
Do you like it?

3
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,480
But... it looks expensive.

4
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,920
It was expensive.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,200
I was surprised.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,410
About our wedding...

7
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,550
Would you like to have it...

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,720
...when you get better
after the surgery?

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,030
I don't mind to skipping the wedding.

10
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,040
You should.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,630
A wedding is also a way
to say thank you...

12
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,570
to your parents for raising you well.

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,400
Somewhere nice...

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,870
...with all our parents,
friends and relatives...

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,200
...I want to make you the prettiest
and happiest bride ever.

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,950
So if you want a fabulous wedding,
you should get better soon.

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,410
But then...

18
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,900
...our parents would have
to change their minds about us.

19
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,980
Take this as well.

20
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,980
She might get out of breath,
feel dizzy, collapse...

21
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,310
or in the worst case,
loose consciousness.

22
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,450
You should never be flustered.

23
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,960
It's important to keep her stable.

24
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,390
Is there any sort of program...

25
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,250
which I can learn
about her condition?

26
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,890
There's a seminar
about organ transplant patients.

27
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,900
I'll find out more and let
you know tomorrow.

28
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,900
Okay.

29
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,680
If you continue to stay here
at the hospital...

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,500
...I'll sleep over at
your place sometimes.

31
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,400
Thank you.

32
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,370
What is he doing that's taking so long?

33
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,450
It hasn't been that long.

34
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,690
Where did you go?

35
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,090
Oh.

36
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,330
I needed to look for some information.

37
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,430
Why don't you go home tonight
and get some rest?

38
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,060
Mom.

39
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,660
That's not what I meant.

40
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,870
I think you should take care...

41
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,380
of your children and work.

42
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,810
You haven't even had a chance to rest.

43
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,870
I'll stay here tonight.

44
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,270
Go home and get some rest.

45
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,070
Please don't go.

46
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,330
Grandmother came over for dinner?

47
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,500
Yes.
She even promised to visit often.

48
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,950
Ha!

49
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,440
What's going on with her?

50
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,740
I know.

51
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,130
I really liked her visiting, though.

52
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,720
Ba Da was unfamiliar
with her at first...

53
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,880
but they quickly became close
on the way to the hospital.

54
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,780
- Give this to *Unni.
- [Unni: Older sister or older female]

55
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,080
Ba Da and I made it...

56
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,300
because we can't take real flowers
to her because of the pollen.

57
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,520
I'll deliver it to her safely.

58
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,130
How is she sick?

59
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,970
It isn't a stomachache, right?

60
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,170
Does she have to stay in the hospital
for a long time?

61
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,180
I think so.

62
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,220
Dad wants to be with her to protect her
while she is.

63
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,120
What?

64
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,190
Of course you have to.

65
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,350
My dad is great.

66
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,700
You're the greatest in the world!

67
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,320
I want to marry a man like you.

68
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,940
I'm surprised you'd give me
such a compliment.

69
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,660
Protect her well, dad.

70
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,750
Keep my friend safe, okay?

71
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,060
Good morning.

72
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,680
My Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom!

73
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,910
Unni.

74
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,710
You didn't go to work?

75
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,860
Mr. CEO gave me the day off...

76
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,580
...because he's going
to look for something.

77
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,770
He asked me to spend time with you.

78
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,080
Ah, that's right.

79
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,950
He kept asking me
to take good care of you.

80
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,950
He's so sweet.

81
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,990
What is this?

82
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,470
Who made it?
It's so cute.

83
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,940
Look how adorable it is.

84
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,060
- Unni.
- Yeah?

85
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,240
I have a favor to ask you.

86
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,720
Yes, yes.
What is it?

87
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,760
- Tell me.
- Can you bring me the laptop over there?

88
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,080
Sure, sure, sure!

89
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,700
Where is it?
Where is it?

90
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,920
Here.

91
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,090
It's so small I thought it was a book.

92
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,960
Here.

93
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,350
I'll lift up your bed.

94
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,790
I'll lift you up.

95
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,240
What?

96
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,210
What do you want my help with?

97
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,110
You see...

98
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,010
I found something on the internet.

99
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,860
This.

100
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,390
Really?

101
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,350
How is your patient's
operation prognosis?

102
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,910
Her condition improved, so she's
been discharged from the hospital...

103
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,760
...and she has regular checkups.

104
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,120
Before the operation,
she could barely walk...

105
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,530
...but now she can have a normal life.

106
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,970
I heard that the patient is quite old.

107
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:23,970
Yes.

108
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,180
Her health was in such
critical condition...

109
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,490
it was difficult for her to undergo
the operation.

110
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,180
Abroad, there was a patient...

111
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,150
who lasted seven years
with the same mechanical heart.

112
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,810
I heard it was the longest success
of all these cases.

113
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,640
She's okay.

114
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,320
Hey, daughter.

115
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,380
I told you that your condition
hasn't worsened.

116
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,850
That means you're getting better.

117
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:16,850
Okay?

118
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,700
Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom Yi!

119
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,200
Hey!

120
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,470
Do you know how much work
I've done for you today?

121
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,840
I reserved...

122
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,550
an awesome place just for you...

123
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,180
What's wrong with you?

124
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,420
Hey.

125
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,750
You're back in the office
right after surgery.

126
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,990
Yes, I needed to review some materials.

127
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,600
How's Bom Yi?

128
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,470
She's just hanging in there.

129
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,430
I need to figure out something quickly.

130
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,030
- *Hyung keeps hurrying me.
- [Hyung: Older brother or older male]

131
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,670
Eat this first, then work.

132
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,850
What are you doing?

133
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,610
What?

134
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,390
Have a seat so we can share it.

135
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,290
You know that I hate eating alone.

136
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,270
Is this a joke or a favor?

137
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,270
It's a favor.

138
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,810
Then ask me politely.

139
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,830
Would you like to have a seat?

140
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,340
Let's enjoy it together.

141
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,810
The reminds me of old times.

142
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,350
Want me to spoon-feed you
like old times then?

143
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,620
I need to tell you something.

144
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,620
Huh?

145
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,970
Let's do it later.

146
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,720
A little later.

147
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,040
This is your favorite.

148
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:02,930
Open your mouth.

149
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,730
Don't do this.

150
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,790
Please?

151
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,740
Ah!

152
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,420
Oh...

153
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,770
I'll be back later.

154
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,530
Please come in.

155
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,780
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

156
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,880
What is all that?

157
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,350
They're research and materials...

158
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:39,090
There's so much I can't understand
that I wanted to review it with you.

159
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,620
This is the critical moment.

160
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,250
Hey.

161
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,410
Why are you here?

162
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,460
What?
I don't have much to do after work...

163
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,790
so I'm on standby for you 24/7.

164
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,860
Have you gotten any sleep?

165
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,320
You look so tired...

166
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,990
...you look more lousy than before.

167
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,850
Hurry and go in.

168
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,390
Is Bom Yi in bad mood?

169
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,520
No.

170
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,740
She's just been waiting for you
for a while.

171
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,740
Is that right?

172
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,900
Bom Yi.

173
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,000
Don't do this now.

174
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,610
I want to give you a proper wedding.

175
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,840
When?

176
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,050
When you get better.

177
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,470
Then I'll just be a patient to you...

178
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,250
until then, Dong Ha.

179
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,080
I want to be your wife, not a patient...

180
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,300
...even if I only live
for another minute.

181
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,510
I'm sorry.

182
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,100
I know that you want to make me...

183
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,820
the happiest and
prettiest bride ever...

184
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,530
...but I'm so happy now...

185
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,270
...please forgive me even
if I'm not pretty.

186
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,740
You are pretty.

187
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,530
Even if...

188
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,970
I become your wife now...

189
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,820
...I won't be able
to do anything for you.

190
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,610
I can't make a delicious
meal for you...

191
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,820
find your missing socks...

192
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,330
...and I can't do anything...

193
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,430
for your children.

194
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,160
Only thing I can do now is...

195
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,640
...tell you how I feel about you.

196
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,900
I'm sorry.

197
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,090
I, Lee Bom Yi, take you, Kang Dong Ha...

198
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,430
the sweetest and nicest
man in the world...

199
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,710
to be my husband.

200
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,230
I promise to be true to you
in good times and in bad...

201
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,470
in sickness...

202
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,510
and in health.

203
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,110
Even though I can't
live for a long time...

204
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,400
whether...

205
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,360
...I live a day or eternity...

206
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:57,400
I'll love you and honor you...

207
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,050
all the days of my life.

208
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,940
It's your turn, my groom.

209
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,720
I promise too.

210
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,000
Then...

211
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,050
...you may kiss the bride.

212
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,450
How do you feel now?

213
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,310
Today must have been tiring.

214
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,070
But I was very happy.

215
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,840
I'm sorry.

216
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,050
Are you sorry for marrying me?

217
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,730
Do you want to cancel it?

218
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,500
I can't do that.

219
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,550
I hope that I get better soon.

220
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,190
I don't mind having a simple wedding...

221
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,340
but I'm looking forward
to the honeymoon.

222
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,240
Let's go then.

223
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,020
Is there somewhere you want to go?

224
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,610
The windy hills...

225
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,990
...of Udo Island.

226
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,880
What?

227
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,390
No way.

228
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,630
Never.

229
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,850
What are you talking about?

230
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,300
I think it'd be good
for her to visit there.

231
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,290
She's very depressed...

232
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,330
...because of the results
from her last checkup.

233
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,980
Still, it's too dangerous.

234
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,530
It is dangerous.

235
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,710
It could make things worse.

236
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,130
You heard him, right?

237
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,720
But I think I can find a way.

238
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,520
What kind of a way?

239
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,680
Don't talk so carelessly.
She's not your daughter.

240
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,680
What way?

241
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,170
I know a lot about the hospital
on the island.

242
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,230
One of my friends
is a thoracic surgeon there.

243
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,260
Fine, but...

244
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,490
she can't take a
flight in her condition.

245
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,300
It's on an island,
so there'd be a ferry ride.

246
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,550
She can't do that either.

247
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,210
What about a helicopter?

248
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,170
Here.

249
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,620
Hello!

250
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,370
Hold on.

251
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,900
What are you doing?

252
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,890
Don't move.
It makes it harder.

253
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,610
I didn't even have breakfast.

254
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,250
I'm embarrassed.

255
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:22,870
God.

256
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,930
My back hurts.

257
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,920
Hey, did you clean up the house?

258
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,160
Yes, I did.

259
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,490
Did you do it well?

260
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,890
Or did you just go around
and sweep the dirt under the rugs?

261
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,580
I said I did a good job.

262
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,350
I'll check under the rugs later.

263
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,370
Hello?

264
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,820
<i>Did you clean up the house?</i>

265
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,630
I did.

266
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,970
I told you I did!

267
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:57,770
Groceries!

268
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,600
Ask him if he did the grocery shopping.

269
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,210
That's right.
Did you get groceries too?

270
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,310
Did you buy everything we told you?

271
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:05,930
Yes.

272
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,450
Oh!
That's right.

273
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,410
The edges...

274
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,020
Did you cover the edges
of all the furniture?

275
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,360
Also, you need to boil...

276
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,900
the spoons, chopsticks
and dishcloths.

277
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,520
- Blankets!
- Of, the blankets!

278
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,710
The blankets and bedding...
You need to wash those too.

279
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,500
Yes.
Don't be mad at me.

280
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,550
We should have followed them.

281
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:31,230
It's their honeymoon.
We shouldn't have followed them.

282
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,110
That's right.
It's their honeymoon.

283
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:36,040
<i>Do you want to have a wedding
and go on a honeymoon too?</i>

284
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:39,270
They must be crazy.

285
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,190
They always talk to each other
when they call me.

286
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,190
What?

287
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,130
Huh?

288
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,940
Their honeymoon suite?

289
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,160
Don't worry about it.

290
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,120
I decorated the room...

291
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,500
..for a really sexy, hot mood.

292
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,680
Okay.

293
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:05,900
Oh, I'd like to call my parents.

294
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,710
That's right.
That's right.

295
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,130
It's mine.

296
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,250
Hello?

297
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,300
Yes.

298
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,480
Did you get there safely?

299
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,530
Is Bom Yi okay?

300
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,880
Let me talk to her.

301
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,340
Wait a moment.

302
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,840
My wife wants to talk to Bom Yi.

303
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,730
Hello?

304
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,730
Bom Yi?

305
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,430
Was she on the phone?

306
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,470
Hello?

307
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,150
<i>Mom.</i>

308
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,690
Are you alright?

309
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,120
Yes, mom.

310
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,960
<i>There's a doctor here too...</i>

311
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,430
<i>so don't worry, okay?</i>

312
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,360
Okay.

313
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,790
Give me the phone.

314
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,010
Give me your hand.

315
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,780
I want to call your mother too.

316
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,850
Huh?

317
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,060
I can't just call my parents.

318
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,620
It's okay.

319
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,640
She doesn't even know we're married.

320
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,750
We didn't have a
proper wedding either.

321
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,860
She'll be mad at me.

322
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,470
I'll tell her about our wedding
when I get back...

323
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,970
...but I still want to call her now.

324
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,740
Hello?

325
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,740
Hi, Miss Lee Bom Yi.

326
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,580
Yes, it's me... mother.

327
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,690
How are you?

328
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,800
I'm fine.

329
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:05,100
I'm sorry to worry you.

330
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,350
Don't be sorry.

331
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,730
<i>Mr. CEO is staying with me...</i>

332
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,000
but it's making you
uncomfortable, isn't it?

333
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,990
He's doing it because he likes it.

334
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:18,270
Don't be sorry to me.
Use him as much as you need.

335
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:25,560
I have to tell you something...

336
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,390
...so I'll visit you soon.

Bom Yi.

503
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,260
Come on, I'm here.

504
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,750
Don't be scared.

505
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,770
Slowly...

506
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,010
Breathe slowly.

507
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,170
Slowly...

508
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,610
Slowly...

509
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,760
That's right.

510
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,110
How are you?

511
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,550
You're okay, right?

512
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,470
You have such a nice husband.

513
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:39,320
He took very good care of you.

514
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,770
You should go back to Seoul
in the morning.

515
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,290
You can't take care
of her properly here.

516
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:47,400
What I did is only
a temporary expedient, so...

517
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,780
What about the windy hills?

518
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,660
No way.

519
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,170
Don't even think about it.

520
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,700
Okay?

521
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:57,700
Okay?

522
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,360
Thank you.

523
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,950
I'm sorry...

524
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,320
for surprising you.

525
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,080
I wasn't surprised at all.

526
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,760
I don't think that we can go.

527
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:27,410
Right?

528
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,940
Can I get some fresh air?

529
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,400
It's stuffy in here.

530
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:54,690
Thank you for bringing me here.

531
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,030
If you want anything...

532
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,710
...tell me anytime.

533
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,590
I'm sorry.

534
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,500
Why do you keep apologizing?

535
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,390
I'm so happy right now.

536
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,170
Maybe...

537
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,700
we weren't allowed
to love each other...

538
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:25,410
...which is why we pushed
each other away...

539
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,470
and we tried to leave each other.

540
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,810
But now we're here...

541
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,390
as a married couple.

542
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,600
At first we sat here...

543
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,060
and talked about old stories.

544
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:56,210
Then we sat here...

545
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,940
and talked about the future...

546
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,720
so for now...

547
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,120
let's just talk about the present.

548
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:08,080
What if...

549
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,700
...by some chance...

550
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,160
...I don't wake up tomorrow?

551
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,790
That won't happen.

552
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,820
I didn't say it to hurt you...

553
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,470
and it's not because I'm
getting weak either.

554
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,470
I'm just worried that...

555
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,720
...I may not have a chance
to say goodbye to you.

556
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:04,740
Would you like to say goodbye
to me in advance?

557
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:20,090
Do it now.

558
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,600
I'll remember it.

559
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:39,770
Don't...

560
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:42,380
...come here again.

561
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,360
I won't...

562
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:50,060
become a star...

563
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:53,660
so don't come here...

564
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:56,400
to watch the night sky.

565
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,580
Don't come here and drink alone...

566
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,420
...cry alone...

567
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:12,540
...or sleep alone.

568
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,180
I don't want you to suffer alone...

569
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:23,050
...in a dream where I'm not there.

570
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:30,410
It makes you too attractive.

571
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:33,840
I'm worried you'll find
another woman that way.

572
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:39,000
Then don't leave.

573
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,150
Stay here with me like this...

574
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,940
...forever.

575
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:57,270
If there's a chance...

576
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,370
that I'll be reborn...

577
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:05,870
...I'll make sure I'm healthy
in the next life.

578
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:09,570
Then I'll love you much more...

579
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,980
and much longer than
I did in this life.

580
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:29,020
Then I'll be the one to protect you.

581
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:42,900
Now...

582
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,950
...the soup is ready and...

583
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,570
Here.

584
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:19,230
<i>Are you ready to go to the windy hill?</i>

585
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,000
I'm not really confident
I can do this.

586
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:55,620
It's not as high as you think.

587
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:59,730
You keep thinking you're sick,
so it looks father than it is.

588
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:01,360
That's why you're scared of it.

589
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:04,710
You just need to take one step forward
every ten minutes.

590
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:06,410
We have plenty of time.

591
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,020
I don't think that I can do it.

592
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:32,950
I don't think...

593
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,810
that I can do it.

594
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,540
I'll help you.

595
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,510
I'll help you...

596
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:46,940
...so don't give up.

597
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:31,580
<i>- What are you doing over there?
- Oh my God!</i>

598
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:34,050
<i>You're not planning on falling
and drowning, right?</i>

599
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:35,470
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

600
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:36,760
<i>Why would I want to die?</i>

601
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,000
<i>I can't die young.</i>

602
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,750
<i>I have to live a long, healthy life...</i>

603
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:43,330
<i>- ...and live each day to the fullest.
- What is she talking about?</i>

604
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:57,010
<i>Soo Jeong!</i>

605
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:58,010
<i>Soo Jeong!</i>

606
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,250
<i>Soo Jeong!</i>

607
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:01,020
<i>Open your eyes, honey!</i>

608
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:03,420
<i>- Soo Jeong!
- Hey, wake up!</i>

609
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:04,970
<i>She isn't your wife.</i>

610
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:08,080
<i>I...</i>

611
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,320
<i>...prayed every day...</i>

612
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,530
<i>...for...</i>

613
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:18,340
<i>...someone else to die instead of me.</i>

614
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,500
<i>Then...</i>

615
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,670
<i>...it actually happened.</i>

616
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,460
Are you alright?

617
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:33,460
<i>That's right.</i>

618
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,280
<i>Soo Jeong's heart...</i>

619
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,680
<i>...is Bom Yi's now.</i>

620
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:42,440
<i>I thought...</i>

621
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:45,520
<i>...I liked her...</i>

622
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:48,820
<i>...because of your heart...</i>

623
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,440
<i>...but now...</i>

624
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:56,070
<i>...I don't think
that's true anymore.</i>

625
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,940
<i>I'm sorry that it isn't true.</i>

626
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:05,170
<i>I'm sorry, Poo Reum.</i>

627
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:09,070
<i>I'm sorry, Ba Da.</i>

628
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:13,840
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

629
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,290
<i>This heart...</i>

630
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,760
<i>...isn't hers anymore.</i>

631
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:25,240
<i>It's yours now, Bom Yi.</i>

632
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:42,660
<i>After I told you to leave me...</i>

633
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:45,270
<i>...I was so afraid...</i>

634
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:48,330
<i>...that you'd already left me.</i>

635
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:53,130
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

636
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,170
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

637
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,210
<i>Don't come here again.</i>

638
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,560
<i>I won't become a star...</i>

639
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:10,400
<i>so don't come here...</i>

640
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:13,050
<i>to watch the night sky.</i>

641
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:18,280

<i>I don't want you to suffer alone...</i>

00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:32,450
<i>...in a dream where I'm not there.</i>

646
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,660
<i>Then don't leave.</i>

647
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:44,870
<i>Stay here with me like this...</i>

648
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:48,690
<i>...forever.</i>

649
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:01,830
<i>If there's a chance...</i>

650
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:05,340
<i>that I'll be reborn...</i>

<i>Then I'll be the one to protect you.</i>

655
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,340
Are you okay?

656
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:00,220
Bom Yi.

657
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,380
Look.

658
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:05,010
You can do it.

659
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,250
You're almost there.

660
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:08,430
Just a few more steps.

661
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,130
Bom Yi.

662
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:14,910
Bom Yi!

663
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,200
Look at me.

664
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:18,370
Don't look anywhere else.

665
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:20,630
Bom Yi.

666
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:23,540
Now...

667
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:25,250
