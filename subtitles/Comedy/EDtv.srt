1
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,653
Since its debut,
True TV has brought you...

2
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:06,960
the finest in documentary
and informational programming.

3
00:01:07,032 --> 00:01:09,557
You've counted on us,
and we've taken you there.

4
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:12,536
From the edge of the world
to the edge of your seat,

5
00:01:12,604 --> 00:01:15,266
from the streets of L.A.
To the Serengeti Plain,

6
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,808
from inner peace to outer space,

7
00:01:17,876 --> 00:01:20,936
your funniest moments
and most tragic times.

8
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:24,608
You've laughed, you've cried,
you've almost died.

9
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:27,345
But now we'll take you
where you've never been before.

10
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:31,253
No script, no actors, no editing.

11
00:01:31,323 --> 00:01:33,848
All day, all night, all true.

12
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:37,157
Every second is true on True TV...

13
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,493
this spring.

14
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:44,761
So, any questions?

15
00:01:45,971 --> 00:01:47,632
Yes?

16
00:01:47,706 --> 00:01:50,641
I think we get that it's true,
but what is it?

17
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:53,303
Cynthia, why don't you come up here?
This is your moment.

18
00:01:53,378 --> 00:01:56,745
Folks, this is Cynthia Topping.
She's the program director at True TV.

19
00:01:56,815 --> 00:02:01,149
She's the one that's gonna be strapped
to a Scud missile if this doesn't work.

20
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,658
Thank you, Mr. Whitaker.
I've always wanted to travel.

21
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:11,685
- Yes?
- Isn't this show similar to
a show P.B.S. Had in the '70s?

22
00:02:11,763 --> 00:02:15,199
- The Loud Family?
- No, no, this is completely different.

23
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:18,202
We are gonna...
We're gonna pick one person,

24
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,797
one, one normal person,

25
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:24,138
not like you folks.

26
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:29,909
And we're gonna put that person's life
on television all day long, live.

27
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:32,382
It's not P.B.S.,
it's not Real World.

28
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:34,783
We're not gonna film it
and then edit it later.

29
00:02:34,853 --> 00:02:37,686
Is that how I sound?
I don't sound like that, do I?

30
00:02:37,756 --> 00:02:39,724
- More or less.
- On a good day.

31
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,656
You never said anything?

32
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:45,060
- I don't mean to be negative here.
- Ooh!

33
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,462
Hey!

34
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:51,902
I know this was your idea, but doesn't
this have a great chance of being...

35
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,336
A big, smelly bomb?
Oh, you betcha! Yeah.

36
00:02:54,406 --> 00:02:58,240
And wouldn't that be,
you know, a bad thing?

37
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,973
Keith, we're getting our butts kicked
by the Gardening Channel.

38
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:03,981
People would rather watch soil.

39
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:09,009
We are this close to having
chalk outlines around our careers.

40
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:11,920
I love that we're doing this,
and I love that it's risky.

41
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,925
All anyone every does
in this business is follow the pack.

42
00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:19,657
Hell, if people tune into this twice
a day for five minutes, we're a hit.

43
00:03:19,731 --> 00:03:22,029
You know what finally
convinced me that this could work?

44
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,227
Half a dozen wine coolers?

45
00:03:24,303 --> 00:03:27,170
When I realized that
the person we pick,

46
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,640
the guy that's on TV
all day long, doesn't have to be good.

47
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:35,009
- If he's good, great,
but if he's bad, even better.
- Bad is better?

48
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,914
People can't turn away from an accident.
You drive by and say,

49
00:03:38,984 --> 00:03:41,782
"Ooh, I hope there's not
a head in the road. That would be..."

50
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:44,151
But then you look.
You don't wanna miss it.

51
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:47,248
So we put a guy on TV,
and we sit and wait and see...

52
00:03:47,326 --> 00:03:50,261
if that head starts rollin'
down the highway.

53
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:52,388
Now that's fun
for the whole family.

54
00:03:52,464 --> 00:03:58,300
- So, what's our next step?
- We find ourselves
a big, fat rolling head.

55
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:03,031
Are you seeing this?
Are you looking around you?

56
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:06,236
God, you know what this is?

57
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:09,747
This is a horror show.

58
00:04:09,815 --> 00:04:12,215
- What are you going off
about now, John Boy?
- This doesn't bug you?

59
00:04:12,284 --> 00:04:15,082
All our friends and
everybody getting married,

60
00:04:15,153 --> 00:04:17,451
and are having kids
and their careers.

61
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:21,390
- Their kids are having careers.
It's a mess.
- Why would that bug me?

62
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,293
Look at us, right?
We are doin' fine.

63
00:04:24,363 --> 00:04:28,493
Oh. Okay.
You have a beer around your neck.

64
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:31,331
- Okay?
- That's my point!

65
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:33,462
- Your brother's here.
- Hey, go long, man.

66
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,604
I'm gonna go say hi to Kim.

67
00:04:37,676 --> 00:04:42,238
Yeah. Listen, that was great
tonight. I loved it. Oh, man!

68
00:04:42,314 --> 00:04:44,282
- Insane, Ray.
- What's goin' on?

69
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:46,442
I'm tellin' ya, it's weird.

70
00:04:46,518 --> 00:04:50,750
We meet, we go out and bing-bang-boom,
she's got me meetin' her parents.

71
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:52,983
What do you mean,
bing-bang-boom, buddy?

72
00:04:53,058 --> 00:04:56,084
You've been goin' out with her
for six months.

73
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:58,026
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

74
00:04:58,096 --> 00:05:00,997
I suddenly feel like
the walls are closing in on me.

75
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:06,197
You know? The father is sittin' there
askin' me about my career prospects.

76
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:08,205
- What was I saying?
- Can you believe that?

77
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:10,673
Oh, at dinner,

78
00:05:10,742 --> 00:05:13,472
the dog is sniffing my balls.

79
00:05:13,545 --> 00:05:15,843
At least I hope it was the dog,

80
00:05:15,914 --> 00:05:19,008
because her mother
disappeared for a while.

81
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:26,448
- What's goin' on over there?
- They're doin' audition tapes
for that True TV thing.

82
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:28,959
People are sendin' 'em in
from all over the place.

83
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:32,394
- Oh, yeah? That's cool!
- What's cool?

84
00:05:32,464 --> 00:05:36,127
- To be that guy,
that guy they watch all day.
- Get outta here.

85
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:39,898
Mark my words.
That guy is gonna be famous.

86
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:43,532
He'll be able to get
whatever he wants, whoever he wants.

87
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:45,701
Hey, trust me.
This is my business.

88
00:05:45,777 --> 00:05:48,473
- What is?
- Show business.

89
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:52,074
- You in show business now?
- Yeah, I service video equipment.

90
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:57,918
That's like saying
those people stitchin' Nikes
in Panama are in the N.B.A.

91
00:05:57,989 --> 00:06:00,617
Hello?

92
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:02,557
- Bed-wetter.
- Thumb-sucker.

93
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:05,564
- You know what?
I'm gonna go make a tape.
- You know what?

94
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:06,724
- You know what?
I'm gonna go make a tape.
- You know what?

95
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:07,566
I'm excited.

96
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:09,227
I'm excited.

97
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:12,327
I know that I can do this.

98
00:06:12,404 --> 00:06:14,338
It's my turn.
I'm next, I'm next.

99
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:18,365
- Buzz, can I get one more?
- You got it.

100
00:06:18,443 --> 00:06:20,877
Hello there.

101
00:06:20,946 --> 00:06:23,107
So Ray met the family, huh?

102
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:25,672
Oh, yeah.

103
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:27,844
I heard the dog really liked him.

104
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,184
Yeah. The whole family loved him.

105
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:34,987
But of course, my whole family really
loved the last guy I went out with,

106
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,688
and he strung me along
for a year and then dumped me.

107
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:39,822
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

108
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:47,531
And, you know, every guy
I ever broke up with,

109
00:06:47,606 --> 00:06:50,734
the minute it's over,
I could tell you what went wrong.

110
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:54,905
How it went wrong.
Why it had to go wrong.

111
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,073
But when I'm in it,

112
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:59,344
lost.

113
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:02,079
I'm like a love coroner!

114
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:05,555
Bring me the corpse,
I'll tell you what killed it.

115
00:07:05,624 --> 00:07:08,491
But how to prevent it? Lost.

116
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:14,895
Hi! I'm Ray Pekurny!

117
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:20,836
I'm from here in San Francisco,
the greatest city in the world.

118
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:23,340
- Are you with me?
- Yeah!

119
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:26,741
Go, Niners!

120
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:28,473
How are things goin'?

121
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:31,675
Okay, I want to introduce you
to my girlfriend.

122
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,447
She's really cute, she's really cool,

123
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,580
and she's... really strong.

124
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:41,922
She's a U.P.S. Person.
She lifts packages. Not beefy.

125
00:07:41,993 --> 00:07:46,692
She told me this joke. What do you get
when you cross U.P.S. With Fed Ex?

126
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:50,201
Fed up! It's her joke.

127
00:07:50,268 --> 00:07:53,465
Oh, my brother, my brother.
Ed, yeah, come on.

128
00:07:56,274 --> 00:07:59,835
- Say somethin', Ed.
- Asshole!

129
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:03,574
- Come on, man. Say somethin'.
- All right.

130
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:07,482
I don't know about this whole 24-hour
TV thing y'all got goin',

131
00:08:07,552 --> 00:08:11,545
- but if you are gonna go forward
with it, this is your man.
- Smart guy.

132
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:13,921
The Ray-man here.
This guy's got stories.

133
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:16,893
- This guy has lived.
- I've got stories. I've lived!

134
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:19,658
- Tell 'em about that dog grooming
business you started.
- No, not that story.

135
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:23,292
- You gotta tell 'em about that.
- No, I don't really wanna...

136
00:08:23,368 --> 00:08:25,302
I'm telling. Here we go.

137
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,531
- This guy?
- Yeah, take a look at this kid.

138
00:08:27,606 --> 00:08:29,836
He was gonna start up a mobile
dog groomin' business.

139
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:33,071
- He's cute. Yes!
- Really?

140
00:08:33,144 --> 00:08:35,408
- He doesn't wanna be
like everybody else.
- No.

141
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,541
He doesn't start it in a van or a pickup
truck or something like that.

142
00:08:39,618 --> 00:08:44,954
- The Ray-man, he starts it in a Camry!
- Camry!

143
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:48,925
- Camry! Two door.
- Camry.

144
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:50,928
So he gets a tub,
and he puts it in the trunk.

145
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:53,521
He throws the dogs in the tub, slams
the trunk and starts drivin' around.

146
00:08:53,598 --> 00:08:58,501
Speeds up, stops real quick,
turns left, turns right
to get the dogs all sudded up.

147
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:03,234
Pretty smart, right? Now, guess
how he dries 'em off. Guess.

148
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:04,875
With the exhaust!

149
00:09:06,376 --> 00:09:10,244
What do you say? We bring him in,
can't hurt. Just talk to him?

150
00:09:10,313 --> 00:09:14,682
Well, I'm from east Texas. Yep.

151
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,515
And when I was like 13,

152
00:09:17,587 --> 00:09:22,217
my mom got remarried to my stepfather
who was a traveling salesman.

153
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:26,922
He got transferred up here to
San Francisco, so we all came along.

154
00:09:26,997 --> 00:09:31,229
- Here we are, here I am.
- Mm-hmm. Terrific.

155
00:09:31,301 --> 00:09:34,293
- Did you go to college or...
- I had a year of junior college.

156
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:37,602
Home of the Bear Cats.

157
00:09:37,674 --> 00:09:41,474
Oh, scary. What did you study?

158
00:09:41,544 --> 00:09:46,982
Studyin'? Geez, that'd have been
a big help. Where were you then?

159
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,314
That's cute.

160
00:09:49,386 --> 00:09:52,617
- Straight ahead.
- What? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

161
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:56,557
And as you see, I can get rid
of the Texas accent whenever I want.

162
00:09:56,626 --> 00:10:00,118
Or I can just slide...

163
00:10:00,196 --> 00:10:03,597
real deep on into it like this.

164
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:06,727
How do you decide?

165
00:10:06,803 --> 00:10:11,263
To tell you the truth,
I find this accent here...

166
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:14,071
don't do me no harm
with the ladies.

167
00:10:16,313 --> 00:10:18,975
Know what I mean, darlin'?

168
00:10:21,818 --> 00:10:24,082
Yeah.

169
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:26,554
No, never been married.

170
00:10:26,623 --> 00:10:28,318
Um,

171
00:10:29,426 --> 00:10:31,792
I've been burned
a couple times, though.

172
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:34,762
My father?

173
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:41,426
Um, well, let's see. When I was 12,
my mom got a hysterectomy.

174
00:10:41,504 --> 00:10:45,031
He ran off with her nurse,
and I haven't seen him since.

175
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:49,909
That's my dad, Hank Pekurny.

176
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,039
Next question?

177
00:10:52,115 --> 00:10:56,347
Like one time I was playin'
pee-wee football back in Texas, right?

178
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:58,353
And I dislocated my finger.

179
00:10:58,421 --> 00:11:00,446
My mom comes rollin' out of
the bleachers now...

180
00:11:00,523 --> 00:11:02,491
and busts through this little
group of kids, grabs my finger.

181
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,686
Whack!
Pops it back into place.

182
00:11:04,761 --> 00:11:09,130
Runs up, slaps the coach upside the head
and says, "Let's get the game on!"

183
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:11,292
That's Mom.

184
00:11:12,902 --> 00:11:16,770
Well, I still can't really
bend this finger, though.

185
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,774
Well.

186
00:11:19,943 --> 00:11:21,808
Oh.

187
00:11:21,878 --> 00:11:25,177
Uh, a dream?
Oh, yeah, man, I got a dream.

188
00:11:25,248 --> 00:11:29,207
I, uh, just don't know
what it is yet, you know?

189
00:11:47,804 --> 00:11:51,740
Did you test him?
Did you do any research?

190
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:53,742
Research?

191
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,335
We don't even have money in
our budget for coffee filters.

192
00:11:56,413 --> 00:11:58,347
We're using a yarmulke.

193
00:11:59,582 --> 00:12:01,516
But this is who you want?

194
00:12:03,753 --> 00:12:07,416
I'm going based on something you once
said at a broadcaster's dinner.

195
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,583
I love it. I love it!

196
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:11,593
You see what she does?

197
00:12:11,661 --> 00:12:15,620
See what she does?
She attaches me to her choice.

198
00:12:15,698 --> 00:12:17,757
Thereby fueling my massive ego...

199
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:19,768
and forcing me to like it.

200
00:12:19,836 --> 00:12:22,634
You're great!
How come you never doodle my name?

201
00:12:22,705 --> 00:12:25,367
- I-I do.
- I'm joking.

202
00:12:25,442 --> 00:12:27,376
I'm joking.

203
00:12:27,444 --> 00:12:29,708
Once again.

204
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:32,213
This is the guy
you want to go with?

205
00:12:37,487 --> 00:12:39,421
Yes.

206
00:12:42,358 --> 00:12:46,089
What happens when you go to
the bathroom? Do they go in with ya?

207
00:12:46,162 --> 00:12:49,063
No, Al!
I mean, the bathroom's out of bounds.

208
00:12:49,132 --> 00:12:50,895
Dinner's gettin' cold!

209
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:53,936
My life is not so great
that I want it shown on television.

210
00:12:54,003 --> 00:12:55,937
And neither is yours, Ed.

211
00:12:56,005 --> 00:12:59,907
- That's the whole point.
This could change all that.
- How?

212
00:12:59,976 --> 00:13:05,004
- Huh. Ha. I'm glad you asked.
I want to open a gym.
- A gymnasium?

213
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:09,575
No. A gymnasium is an old, white guy
shootin' free throws like this.

214
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:11,677
I'm talkin' a modern-day
fitness center.

215
00:13:11,754 --> 00:13:13,483
What does this have
to do with Ed?

216
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:17,117
If Ed is on TV for a month,
he gets a balloon payment.

217
00:13:17,193 --> 00:13:18,820
That's big money.

218
00:13:18,895 --> 00:13:22,262
I'd borrow against that right now
at the bank, I'd buy the gym,

219
00:13:22,332 --> 00:13:24,323
I make Ed a silent partner,

220
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,995
and I cut all you in for a slice
because you signed the releases.

221
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:31,768
- This is gonna cost us.
- It's not gonna... Hey, look.

222
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:35,038
Open your eyes instead of your mouth
for once. This is a no-brainer.

223
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:39,548
The whole time I'm gonna
be promoting the gym on TV.

224
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:41,550
It's free advertising.

225
00:13:41,618 --> 00:13:44,280
I mean...
Does anyone else see this?

226
00:13:44,354 --> 00:13:46,822
How 'bout sex?

227
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,594
Sorry, Al, but
I'm gonna have to pass.

228
00:13:51,661 --> 00:13:54,653
And it's not an age thing,
'cause you are still a handsome man.

229
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:58,497
No! Do they show you having sex?

230
00:13:58,568 --> 00:14:02,436
No, Al.
Look, kissin' and huggin'.

231
00:14:02,505 --> 00:14:04,700
- Nudity?
- Ed, you're not gonna be nude.

232
00:14:04,774 --> 00:14:08,801
- Why would I be nude, Ma?
- What kind of a show is this?
It's a filthy show!

233
00:14:08,878 --> 00:14:12,143
- It is not a filthy show.
- Have you even read the whole contract?

234
00:14:12,215 --> 00:14:15,412
- Do you even know what's in it?
- Miss Cautious all of a sudden.

235
00:14:15,485 --> 00:14:18,010
She meets a guy in a bar,
she's married an hour later.

236
00:14:18,087 --> 00:14:22,547
- We didn't get married, we
just thought we were married.
- Marcia, calm down, honey.

237
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,651
He's pickin' on me, and he's
bringin' up all kinds of issues.

238
00:14:25,728 --> 00:14:29,892
- Married is married is married.
- Maybe this isn't a good idea.

239
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:31,831
What isn't?

240
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:36,065
The whole thing. Maybe I'll just
get out now before it gets complicated.

241
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:40,542
- No harm, no foul.
- Great. They had to pick you.
They couldn't pick me.

242
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,703
If he doesn't want to do it...

243
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:47,716
If he doesn't want to do it? He's 31
years old, he's a video store clerk!

244
00:14:47,784 --> 00:14:49,945
What is his grand master plan here?

245
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:52,419
What, is he gonna spend
the rest of his life...

246
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:54,456
rearranging Ernest movies?

247
00:14:54,524 --> 00:14:57,618
Everyone who works there
is 12 years old.

248
00:14:57,694 --> 00:15:01,152
They go through college, they graduate,
and then they stop working there.

249
00:15:01,231 --> 00:15:05,224
Except for him! He stays to welcome
the next batch of 12-year-olds.

250
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:07,701
It's a job for retards!

251
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,931
Ray, stop that!

252
00:15:10,006 --> 00:15:12,566
- Was I being insultin'?
- Uh-huh.

253
00:15:12,642 --> 00:15:15,805
- Tch!
- Yeah, kinda.

254
00:15:15,878 --> 00:15:18,904
- As usual.
- A fella can't...

255
00:15:18,982 --> 00:15:22,110
All right, look, look. Hey.

256
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,484
- You don't have to be scared.
- I'm not scared.

257
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:30,652
- Don't be scared. You're scared, man.
- I'm not scared.

258
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:35,187
- I am not scared, Ray.
- I know you got that
doe-in-the-headlights look.

259
00:15:35,265 --> 00:15:38,462
You're mixing your proteins
and starches, and you can't...

260
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:43,062
I'll tell you what. You don't
have to worry about anything.
You know why? Huh?

261
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:47,098
- No, why?
- Because big brother's riding shotgun.

262
00:15:47,176 --> 00:15:49,804
I've got your back.

263
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:53,406
Did anything ever happen to you when you
were a kid? Anyone ever bother you?

264
00:15:53,483 --> 00:15:57,180
- Just you.
- Just... Just me.

265
00:15:57,253 --> 00:15:59,721
You bring those cameras over
to big brother, and I promise you...

266
00:15:59,789 --> 00:16:02,758
I will make something happen
for both of us, for all of us!

267
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,362
You know, how many chances
do guys like you and I get?

268
00:16:18,941 --> 00:16:21,603
- I don't know.
- Yeah, that's right, you don't know.

269
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:35,981
Guys, when am I gonna get my on-air
feed? All I'm gettin' are color bars.

270
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:39,859
Mike, loosen up a little bit.
Stand by to lose laser. Yeah, good.

271
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:41,863
T.L.C., we're ready to feed.

272
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:44,491
Carlos, show me where
you're gonna be when we go live.

273
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:49,129
There you go, right there. Go back up
a little bit. Okay, right there.

274
00:17:00,683 --> 00:17:04,346
Guys, we're gonna go in ten, nine...

275
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,354
- Hold on, I'm coming.
- Has it started?

276
00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:08,890
- Good morning.
- Sorry.

277
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:13,418
Four, three, two,

278
00:17:13,496 --> 00:17:15,691
and ready one, take one.

279
00:17:15,765 --> 00:17:17,426
Shh.

280
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,060
There he is!

281
00:17:21,904 --> 00:17:24,168
Not the best angle.

282
00:17:35,785 --> 00:17:37,912
This is exciting.

283
00:17:37,987 --> 00:17:40,751
Oh, my God,
is that what I think it is?

284
00:17:40,823 --> 00:17:43,451
- I think so.
- A little morning chubby.

285
00:17:43,526 --> 00:17:45,858
Damn.

286
00:17:52,001 --> 00:17:54,526
Oh, no.

287
00:18:04,714 --> 00:18:06,648
Oh, honey.

288
00:18:06,716 --> 00:18:10,208
- Don't do that.
- Pull it out, pull it out.

289
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:16,621
Well, that's embarrassing.

290
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:18,556
Morning.

291
00:18:23,065 --> 00:18:27,661
- Microphone.
- Mm. Microphone.

292
00:18:30,306 --> 00:18:32,797
Turn on the TV.

293
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:39,680
Morning.

294
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:41,683
I'm Ed.

295
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:43,685
There's that smile!

296
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,094
- Ow, ow, ow! Hot!
- Whoa, an action sequence.

297
00:19:03,205 --> 00:19:05,196
I kind of pieced this stereo
together, a homemade job.

298
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:09,210
This is my wall of chrome.

299
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:12,543
I've been collecting those
since, like, 1973.

300
00:19:21,123 --> 00:19:23,216
Oh, wow.

301
00:19:25,361 --> 00:19:29,457
- What'd I miss?
- He's checking out his own ass.

302
00:19:29,532 --> 00:19:32,501
You gotta see this.
Oh, my...

303
00:19:32,568 --> 00:19:35,833
Oh, my God!

304
00:19:35,905 --> 00:19:38,169
Ohh!

305
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:52,348
Yeah

306
00:19:54,156 --> 00:19:55,885
Hey!

307
00:19:58,394 --> 00:20:00,555
All right

308
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:06,900
Come on, man, hop in.

309
00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:09,529
Let's go!

310
00:20:09,605 --> 00:20:14,269
I need a little time
to believe what's true

311
00:20:14,343 --> 00:20:17,073
I don't know what's going on

312
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,210
Some days I'm stayin'

313
00:20:20,282 --> 00:20:22,546
Some days I'm like a rollin' stone

314
00:20:22,618 --> 00:20:25,178
The mast is down.

315
00:20:25,254 --> 00:20:27,745
Let's go, Sam, let's go!

316
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:35,720
I can't take it

317
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:40,462
I'm thinkin' back so many places

318
00:20:40,536 --> 00:20:43,972
- My heart, my love...
- Hey, Ed! Ed, up here!

319
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:47,270
Guys, film me. Yeah, hi!
Ed, up here!

320
00:20:47,343 --> 00:20:49,811
Yeah!

321
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:51,870
Hey! Hey!

322
00:20:51,947 --> 00:20:54,973
Act like everything is normal.

323
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,779
Go, go!

324
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,555
What's up, Ed?

325
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:12,928
- Guys.
- Welcome to work, Ed.

326
00:21:14,837 --> 00:21:18,773
It's good to be at work... Lou.

327
00:21:18,908 --> 00:21:21,035
I've got just what you need, boys.

328
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:25,945
The best tape in the whole damn store.
Smokey and the Bandit. Huh?

329
00:21:26,015 --> 00:21:28,506
- Who's in that?
- Who?

330
00:21:28,584 --> 00:21:32,179
Burton Leon Reynolds, Jr.,
is in that, boys.

331
00:21:32,254 --> 00:21:35,417
- Who?
- Burton Leon Reynolds, Jr.

332
00:21:35,491 --> 00:21:37,220
Get out.

333
00:21:37,293 --> 00:21:39,693
You can't have this tape.
G-Go home!

334
00:21:39,762 --> 00:21:42,253
Get your raggedy little
Steven Segal-lovin' asses outta here.

335
00:21:42,331 --> 00:21:44,822
"Who is this?"
It's Burt Reynolds!

336
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:52,368
Burt. Burt rules.

337
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:54,602
Alice, why are we watching this?

338
00:21:54,677 --> 00:21:56,645
No reason,
I just wanna see what happens.

339
00:21:56,712 --> 00:22:01,274
Let me spare you the suspense. Nothing's
gonna happen. Trust me on this.

340
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:05,946
Which one of these albums
would you recommend?

341
00:22:06,021 --> 00:22:08,990
I gotta go with that. Yeah.

342
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:11,458
That's a good choice.
That's their first album.

343
00:22:11,527 --> 00:22:14,587
- I think he's cute.
- Can't go wrong with the first album.

344
00:22:14,663 --> 00:22:18,224
It's like before they learned how to.

345
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,495
No, no, no.

346
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:23,697
You look at your husband, okay?
I'm gonna make you say
my name tonight, woman.

347
00:22:23,772 --> 00:22:26,342
Most people like to hurry
through a toenail clippin' session.

348
00:22:26,342 --> 00:22:27,468
Most people like to hurry
through a toenail clippin' session.

349
00:22:27,543 --> 00:22:29,738
Just clip and git.

350
00:22:29,812 --> 00:22:31,871
Not me.

351
00:22:31,947 --> 00:22:35,314
I like to take my time.

352
00:22:36,685 --> 00:22:39,483
I'm meticulous, you know?

353
00:22:39,555 --> 00:22:41,523
I like to do it.

354
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,524
Yeah.

355
00:22:43,592 --> 00:22:46,584
If this guy collects
his toe cheese, I'm outta here.

356
00:22:46,662 --> 00:22:50,428
Some guys start here, then down
to the little toe. That ain't me.

357
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:54,833
I save the big one...

358
00:22:54,904 --> 00:22:56,997
for last.

359
00:22:57,072 --> 00:23:01,441
'Cause it's bigger. You gotta do
some work, you gotta be an artiste.

360
00:23:02,444 --> 00:23:04,571
Look at that.

361
00:23:05,915 --> 00:23:08,042
Oh!

362
00:23:08,117 --> 00:23:11,553
No. No, I haven't seen
the spot ratings.

363
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,249
You know how you're watching the big
game and you gotta do your business?

364
00:23:15,324 --> 00:23:17,349
Right?
The worst time to do it.

365
00:23:17,426 --> 00:23:22,728
Yeah. That's a number that, hopefully,
we can obvi... we'll build from.

366
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:27,064
I don't have to anymore.
Check that out. I designed this.

367
00:23:27,136 --> 00:23:32,005
No, I disagree. I don't think
it's time to pull the plug.

368
00:23:32,074 --> 00:23:34,872
Yes, Mr. Whitaker,
I know they shoot horses.

369
00:23:34,944 --> 00:23:37,469
What do you see?
What is that?

370
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:40,572
That is the TV.
And where am I?

371
00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:44,415
I am on the can.
At the same time I am on the can,

372
00:23:44,486 --> 00:23:46,420
but yet I am still a fan.

373
00:23:46,488 --> 00:23:48,854
You know, it's been one day.

374
00:23:48,924 --> 00:23:53,657
Can you give me a week with this guy,
and then you fly up my nose? Hello?

375
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:58,462
Somebody smart said,
"Practicality wins out."

376
00:23:58,534 --> 00:24:02,630
So, in this bathroom
I'm a... winner.

377
00:24:03,973 --> 00:24:06,100
Yeah.

378
00:24:06,241 --> 00:24:08,732
Five.

379
00:24:08,811 --> 00:24:13,077
Six. Seven.

380
00:24:13,148 --> 00:24:16,640
Eight. Nine!

381
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:19,779
Come on, Ray, she's not that heavy.

382
00:24:22,758 --> 00:24:24,817
Yeah, yeah!

383
00:24:25,894 --> 00:24:28,158
You shifted your weight.

384
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,892
I'm not hurt, I'm not hurt.
I'm okay.

385
00:24:30,966 --> 00:24:34,424
Ray's Gym!
Now accepting applications!

386
00:24:34,503 --> 00:24:38,371
- We want your body! Ray's!
- Look what he did for me. Huh? Huh?

387
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,204
All right! Oh, God!

388
00:24:41,276 --> 00:24:43,437
Hey, John Boy!

389
00:24:43,512 --> 00:24:47,039
What do you like about it?
I don't understand.

390
00:24:47,116 --> 00:24:52,053
I don't know. It's just that...
Well... Just let me watch.

391
00:24:52,121 --> 00:24:54,487
You're gonna love this.
This is a great story.

392
00:24:54,556 --> 00:24:58,720
I got a great story. You remember
Marcia? Of course, she's our sister.

393
00:24:58,794 --> 00:25:02,594
She's goin' out with this new guy.

394
00:25:02,664 --> 00:25:06,293
- They're livin' together.
- You want to save this till later?

395
00:25:06,368 --> 00:25:08,536
No, no, now's the perfect time.

396
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:12,867
He's a singer in a piano bar.
Sings, plays the piano.
And that's how they met.

397
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:16,398
- He sang to her and they fell in love.
- Not even, Buzz.

398
00:25:16,477 --> 00:25:21,039
No. Get this. Some drunk hit him
in the head with a snifter.

399
00:25:21,115 --> 00:25:23,276
One of those things
you keep on the bar for tips?

400
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,511
You don't know, Buzz,
'cause you never get tips.

401
00:25:25,586 --> 00:25:28,680
He hit him over the head 'cause he's
terrible, he's wretched, he's awful.

402
00:25:28,756 --> 00:25:31,884
He's dreadful, he sucks,
I'm tellin' ya, right?

403
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:36,055
That's what happened. She's pullin'
a chunk of glass out of his skull,

404
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:39,122
and he bleeds on her,
and that's all she needs!

405
00:25:39,199 --> 00:25:41,360
Bing! It's amore, right?

406
00:25:41,435 --> 00:25:44,199
The question I'm askin' is:

407
00:25:44,271 --> 00:25:48,833
What's she doin' in a bar?
She's an alcoholic for Christ's sakes!

408
00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:52,208
No, Ray, buddy, not here.

409
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:55,373
I gotta pee, I gotta pee.

410
00:25:57,885 --> 00:26:00,877
Hey, what, are you hidin'
from the police or somethin'?

411
00:26:00,955 --> 00:26:04,584
Come on, show yourself.
Look, is she beautiful?

412
00:26:04,658 --> 00:26:07,092
She's beautiful, right?
That's my girl.

413
00:26:07,161 --> 00:26:10,756
While I'm gone, Edward, tell
'em about that time we lied to Mom...

414
00:26:10,831 --> 00:26:13,129
and then went to Tijuana
to find the donkey show.

415
00:26:15,803 --> 00:26:18,601
I got her, I got her.

416
00:26:20,841 --> 00:26:24,971
- You are, though.
- What?

417
00:26:25,045 --> 00:26:27,809
Beautiful.

418
00:26:33,287 --> 00:26:36,484
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Yeah, bud?

419
00:26:36,557 --> 00:26:41,893
I'm taking a poll on whether or not
I should shave my head.

420
00:26:41,962 --> 00:26:44,522
I've had about 19 beers,
so take that into account.

421
00:26:44,598 --> 00:26:47,328
- Barry, did you see that?
- What?

422
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:50,529
- The girl. The look.
- Yeah.

423
00:26:50,604 --> 00:26:54,062
She likes the Ed guy better
than she likes the brother.

424
00:26:54,141 --> 00:26:56,666
I don't think I like it.
I don't think it's nice.

425
00:26:56,744 --> 00:26:58,837
It's a good set of hair
you got on your head now.

426
00:26:58,912 --> 00:27:02,075
I've had about enough of this.
Give me the remote.

427
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:04,947
Just a few more minutes.
Read your book.

428
00:27:20,968 --> 00:27:24,836
I wanna tell you a story

429
00:27:24,905 --> 00:27:27,965
I wanna tell you about my town

430
00:27:28,042 --> 00:27:31,978
I wanna tell you a story about people

431
00:27:37,618 --> 00:27:39,882
Not this morning. Uh-uh.

432
00:27:39,953 --> 00:27:43,184
Let's change topics. Does anybody
have an opinion, a viewpoint...

433
00:27:43,257 --> 00:27:46,158
on something going on now
called Ed TV?

434
00:27:46,226 --> 00:27:50,390
Oh! This is a new low point
in American culture.

435
00:27:50,464 --> 00:27:53,228
You're being kind.
You're being way too kind.

436
00:28:08,882 --> 00:28:11,510
Brushin' my teeth.

437
00:28:11,585 --> 00:28:14,850
They never bothered
to pick a guy with any talent.

438
00:28:14,922 --> 00:28:16,981
Or even anything to say.

439
00:28:17,057 --> 00:28:20,254
They seem to celebrate
the fact that the guy's a boob.

440
00:28:20,327 --> 00:28:23,592
Sort of a joyous celebration
of boobery. That's what it is.

441
00:28:23,664 --> 00:28:26,656
Take it easy.

442
00:28:28,502 --> 00:28:33,132
- Hey, Ed, your show stinks.
- What a loser!

443
00:28:33,207 --> 00:28:35,937
Hey, Ed, you want my autograph?

444
00:28:36,643 --> 00:28:38,770
Okeydokey.

445
00:28:46,453 --> 00:28:48,444
Ten dollars?

446
00:28:48,522 --> 00:28:52,322
You're telling me now
you want $10 to walk my dog?

447
00:28:52,392 --> 00:28:56,089
Listen, we had a deal,
you little eight-year-old bastard.

448
00:28:56,163 --> 00:28:59,724
I'll tell you what.
Keep the dog.

449
00:29:01,335 --> 00:29:03,735
Who is it?

450
00:29:03,804 --> 00:29:06,500
- Who is it?
- It's me, Ed, buddy.

451
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:10,031
Ed? Just kiddin'. How you doin'?

452
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,101
Good. You ready to watch the game?

453
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:16,775
Actually, no. I'm a little bit sleepy.
I'm tired, exhausted...

454
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,318
What are you talkin' about being
sleepy? Five minutes to tip-off.

455
00:29:19,386 --> 00:29:21,684
It's time for Rocket ball!

456
00:29:21,755 --> 00:29:23,848
Ray, where do you keep
the glasses?

457
00:29:23,924 --> 00:29:29,487
Oh, Shari's here.
Why didn't you just say so, huh?

458
00:29:29,563 --> 00:29:32,589
- Hi, Shari.
- Who's Shari?

459
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:34,600
Who's that?

460
00:29:37,905 --> 00:29:39,839
Okay. Oh, God, oh, God.

461
00:29:39,907 --> 00:29:42,740
- Want me to get that?
- No, I got it. Ed, don't go, l...

462
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:45,973
Whoa, whoa! Look at that!
Get in on that!

463
00:29:46,046 --> 00:29:48,014
Oh, man!

464
00:29:48,081 --> 00:29:50,879
I'm being misled by
a manipulating medium called television.

465
00:29:50,951 --> 00:29:55,388
- Let's get out.
- No, she's a homeless girl.
Ed, don't leave.

466
00:29:55,455 --> 00:29:57,446
She was out on the street, so l...

467
00:29:57,524 --> 00:30:02,359
She didn't have any clothes
or a place to stay, and l...
Honey? Oh, shit! Ed?

468
00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:05,557
What do you mean homeless?
My place is better than this dump.

469
00:30:05,632 --> 00:30:07,395
Dump?

470
00:30:07,467 --> 00:30:10,959
- What?
- That was Shari on the phone.
She saw the whole thing on TV.

471
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:15,031
- I gotta tell ya, she's pissed.
- No shit, Ray. Who's the girl?

472
00:30:15,108 --> 00:30:18,976
The... Come here a second.

473
00:30:19,046 --> 00:30:21,981
She's the receptionist at the place
where I buy that gym equipment.

474
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:25,951
And she's a real knockout and a redhead
to boot, which I've never had.

475
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:27,987
And she's never given me
the time of day.

476
00:30:28,055 --> 00:30:31,923
Suddenly, today she's all, "Hey,
I saw you on TV, and you were great."

477
00:30:31,992 --> 00:30:36,520
And I'm all, "You know, I just made some
gingerroot gazpacho, come on over."

478
00:30:36,597 --> 00:30:38,531
The next thing you know,
ba-da-bing!

479
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:41,796
- I mean, I'm human.
- What do you mean? Why didn't you stop?

480
00:30:41,869 --> 00:30:43,359
Stop?

481
00:30:43,437 --> 00:30:47,305
- Why didn't you stop?
- I'm the guy. I don't stop!

482
00:30:47,374 --> 00:30:50,275
That's the woman's job.
We're the gas, they're the brakes.

483
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:58,217
- Go talk to Shari.
Honey, let him come talk to you.
- Why? Why me?

484
00:30:58,285 --> 00:31:02,085
- Because you brought the cameras here.
- You brought the girl.

485
00:31:02,155 --> 00:31:07,787
Is that the way it is? You can't do me
that one little, simple favor? Great.

486
00:31:07,861 --> 00:31:10,193
Okay, I don't need
any favors from you!

487
00:31:10,264 --> 00:31:13,028
Matter of fact,
P.S., go to hell!

488
00:31:16,203 --> 00:31:18,171
Friggin' out of his gourd.

489
00:31:18,238 --> 00:31:21,765
Ed, man, come on, you know
I really need this. I need this!

490
00:31:21,842 --> 00:31:24,003
If I go over there,
you know they're coming with me.

491
00:31:24,077 --> 00:31:28,173
If I go over, she's gonna put
my balls in a blender.
You know you would, honey.

492
00:31:28,248 --> 00:31:32,275
All I'm askin' is just go talk to her
and beg her. Beg her if you have...

493
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:37,949
Actually, honey, just let him
come beg you. And you owe me.

494
00:31:38,025 --> 00:31:39,959
- I owe you?
- You know you owe me.

495
00:31:40,027 --> 00:31:42,188
- I owe you. I owe you?
- You owe me.

496
00:31:42,262 --> 00:31:45,197
Yes, go!

497
00:31:45,265 --> 00:31:49,395
I can't go on about this.
"I owe you, you owe me."

498
00:31:49,469 --> 00:31:54,406
Look, I have a guest. I'm bein' rude,
all right? I'll talk to you.

499
00:31:54,474 --> 00:31:56,237
Thanks, honey. Okay.

500
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:05,376
Yeah, yeah, Phil,
are you watchin' this?

501
00:32:05,452 --> 00:32:08,421
- Friggin' out of his gourd.
- You might wanna take a look.

502
00:32:08,488 --> 00:32:11,252
- Jack, let's go. We're gonna be late.
- Shush.

503
00:32:11,325 --> 00:32:14,488
- Don't shush me. Oh, shush.
- Shush! Shush!

504
00:32:18,865 --> 00:32:21,197
Hi!

505
00:32:21,268 --> 00:32:23,964
Hi, I'm Rita.
I'm Shari's roommate.

506
00:32:24,037 --> 00:32:25,971
Hey, Rita, I'm Ed.

507
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:29,600
- Shari knew you were
coming over because she saw.
- The cameras, yeah.

508
00:32:29,676 --> 00:32:32,577
She really doesn't want you
and the cameras up here now.

509
00:32:32,646 --> 00:32:37,345
Right. Ah, well, at least...
How is she doin'?

510
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:39,977
I...

511
00:32:40,053 --> 00:32:42,385
I gave her a drink.
I thought...

512
00:32:42,456 --> 00:32:45,220
But she's not much of a drinker,
so it's made her a little...

513
00:32:45,292 --> 00:32:47,954
- What do you want?
- Belligerent.

514
00:32:48,028 --> 00:32:49,859
Hey, Shari.

515
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:52,592
Listen, I'm real sorry about all this.

516
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:55,000
Can I come up?

517
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:57,328
Come on, Shari.

518
00:32:57,402 --> 00:33:02,499
I know it's real awkward with the
cameras, but let me come say two words.

519
00:33:02,574 --> 00:33:04,974
Shari, come on, would ya?

520
00:33:05,043 --> 00:33:07,534
I'm gettin' really wet down here.
Can I come up?

521
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,077
All right, here we go, Carlos.

522
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,744
Just stay with him.
Stay with him.

523
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:16,753
Hang on, Mike.

524
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:19,551
- Ken, am I set?
- You're hard-wired, Mike.

525
00:33:24,229 --> 00:33:26,220
- Hi.
- Hey.

526
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:28,322
- Thanks for lettin' me up.
- Sure.

527
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:32,192
Hey, Shari.

528
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,728
- I'm gonna go to bed. Good night.
- Did I miss anything?

529
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:37,968
Good night.

530
00:33:38,043 --> 00:33:40,409
Hi, Mom.

531
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:47,580
Ray feels...

532
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:50,883
Don't defend
that horse's ass to me!

533
00:33:50,955 --> 00:33:54,652
I'm not. I'm not
defending him, Shari.

534
00:33:54,726 --> 00:33:58,492
I'm just sayin',
maybe this is a good thing.

535
00:33:58,563 --> 00:34:01,088
He got it out of his system, right?

536
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,191
He knows it's not worth it.

537
00:34:03,268 --> 00:34:07,500
- So one day if you two
decide to get married...
- Ha!

538
00:34:07,572 --> 00:34:10,507
I've got news for you.

539
00:34:10,575 --> 00:34:14,875
I never intended to marry him.

540
00:34:14,946 --> 00:34:17,107
Why?

541
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:19,844
Well, for one thing...

542
00:34:21,453 --> 00:34:23,421
he's a bad lay.

543
00:34:28,426 --> 00:34:30,951
I mean bad!

544
00:34:32,931 --> 00:34:34,421
Oh!

545
00:34:34,499 --> 00:34:36,899
You tell him!

546
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,631
Ah, you know that's terrible.

547
00:34:40,705 --> 00:34:43,003
Oh, shit.

548
00:34:43,975 --> 00:34:46,205
Hey, Shari...

549
00:34:46,277 --> 00:34:48,211
You happy now, Ray?

550
00:34:48,279 --> 00:34:51,305
Listen, I think you're pissed-off
at him, and you're hurt.

551
00:34:51,382 --> 00:34:53,816
And you're trying
to get back at Ray.

552
00:34:53,885 --> 00:34:55,910
Don't you think?

553
00:34:57,255 --> 00:35:00,554
Yep, you're right. It's me.

554
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:03,492
It's me! It's always me!

555
00:35:04,996 --> 00:35:09,296
I... I go out with
all different kinds of guys,

556
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:12,530
and the same thing
keeps happening!

557
00:35:12,604 --> 00:35:14,595
Look. You know what?
See these magazines?

558
00:35:14,672 --> 00:35:18,506
I take these quizzes.
"How Are You At Relationships?"

559
00:35:21,813 --> 00:35:26,307
I cheat, okay?
I look in the back for the answers.

560
00:35:26,384 --> 00:35:29,581
Rita says men suck
and they should all die.

561
00:35:29,654 --> 00:35:34,250
Then she eats a pound cake.
She's crazy, but she's not confused.

562
00:35:37,729 --> 00:35:40,960
Me, I examine every little thing.

563
00:35:41,032 --> 00:35:43,500
I'm just like this.

564
00:35:45,904 --> 00:35:48,134
- Shari.
- What?

565
00:35:48,206 --> 00:35:53,041
You're way too terrific of a person
to be doin' this to yourself. You are.

566
00:35:56,748 --> 00:35:59,478
I mean, hey, I've told Ray
a couple of times...

567
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:03,681
I think you are one
of the best and smartest...

568
00:36:03,755 --> 00:36:06,815
and most attractive women
that I have ever met.

569
00:36:06,891 --> 00:36:08,882
I mean that.

570
00:36:14,432 --> 00:36:16,832
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

571
00:36:16,901 --> 00:36:19,028
Really.

572
00:36:19,103 --> 00:36:22,834
There is nothin' wrong with you.

573
00:36:22,907 --> 00:36:25,876
Uh-oh.

574
00:36:35,153 --> 00:36:37,212
Kiss him. Kiss him!

575
00:36:37,288 --> 00:36:39,347
Don't do it, Ed.

576
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:43,817
Don't you kiss her.
Don't you kiss her.

577
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,232
God!

578
00:36:51,836 --> 00:36:54,566
I'm nuts, huh?
Hah! I told him.

579
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:56,334
Yes! Yes, I win!

580
00:36:56,407 --> 00:37:00,707
Oh, Whitaker, you schmuck,
I am the golden goddess of television!

581
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,754
Oh, my God.

582
00:37:16,494 --> 00:37:19,691
Yes, yes, you're on television.
You're on television!

583
00:37:19,764 --> 00:37:22,756
Oh, my God.

584
00:37:22,834 --> 00:37:25,632
Oh, God!

585
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:28,729
Oh, wow.

586
00:37:28,806 --> 00:37:31,570
Listen, Shari?
It's okay.

587
00:37:31,643 --> 00:37:35,545
I just kissed my boyfriend's brother
on television! How is that okay?

588
00:37:35,613 --> 00:37:37,911
When you put it that way,
no, it's not ideal.

589
00:37:37,982 --> 00:37:39,813
- Please go. Go!
- Let's talk.

590
00:37:39,884 --> 00:37:43,217
All right. We're outta here, guys.
Come on, she's right.

591
00:37:43,288 --> 00:37:46,451
Son of a bitch.
What the hell just happened?

592
00:37:46,524 --> 00:37:48,458
Hey, hey!

593
00:37:48,526 --> 00:37:52,656
- Ed, you can't do this to me!
- We're locked out!

594
00:37:59,904 --> 00:38:03,772
No, Carlos, you're killing me!
Just shoot the door.
I got Mike up on the roof.

595
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:05,672
I'm comin'.

596
00:38:08,246 --> 00:38:10,646
What are we doing?

597
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:16,450
- I've got to tell you something.
- What?

598
00:38:16,521 --> 00:38:20,321
- I've had a big thing for you
for months.
- Really?

599
00:38:20,391 --> 00:38:24,623
Yeah. I've been seeing you going out
with Ray and you bein' his girlfriend,

600
00:38:24,696 --> 00:38:27,597
and the whole time I was wishing
you were my girlfriend.

601
00:38:27,665 --> 00:38:29,826
See, me, too!

602
00:38:29,901 --> 00:38:35,635
I am going out with Ray,
and all I can think about is you.

603
00:38:44,048 --> 00:38:46,448
I treated you like a princess!

604
00:38:46,517 --> 00:38:49,611
- This is so weird.
- Yeah, it is weird.

605
00:38:54,325 --> 00:38:56,259
Oh, I gotta go.

606
00:39:14,245 --> 00:39:16,372
¿Uno mas?

607
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:37,998
Ray? Oh, hey, Al.
You seen Ray?

608
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:40,663
- Is he around?
- I'm on television!

609
00:39:40,738 --> 00:39:44,230
Ray was here, but he left when
he saw you were comin' over.

610
00:39:44,308 --> 00:39:47,038
- Shit.
- That was some night last night, huh?

611
00:39:47,111 --> 00:39:49,944
Yeah, it damn sure was, Al.

612
00:39:50,014 --> 00:39:52,039
All right, how about Mom?
Is she around?

613
00:39:52,116 --> 00:39:56,382
She's here in the bedroom.
I'd yell for her, but I'd die.

614
00:39:56,454 --> 00:39:58,922
Don't do that. Mom!

615
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:04,553
I'm here, darlin'. No need to shout.
That's not how you were brought up.

616
00:40:04,629 --> 00:40:07,359
Mom, what are you doin'.

617
00:40:07,432 --> 00:40:10,799
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to my home.

618
00:40:10,868 --> 00:40:13,098
- Blanche DuBois lives.
- Mom, Mom.

619
00:40:13,171 --> 00:40:16,971
I'm looking for Ray. I've been calling
him. He won't call me back.

620
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:19,601
How could you do something like that?
Your own brother's girlfriend.

621
00:40:19,677 --> 00:40:21,907
It's not all my fault.
He cheated on her.

622
00:40:21,979 --> 00:40:26,473
- It was a mistake.
- Yes, it was a mistake.
Do you know where he is?

623
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:29,384
No. Maybe he's watching.

624
00:40:29,454 --> 00:40:32,548
Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you
will stay away from that girl.

625
00:40:32,623 --> 00:40:35,592
No, Ma! And that girl
has a name, okay?

626
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:39,187
What, do you love her
or something?

627
00:40:39,263 --> 00:40:41,629
- Come on, Al.
- Look at that red face.

628
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:43,792
I had a car that color.
A Buick!

629
00:40:43,868 --> 00:40:45,802
Aren't you excited?

630
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:48,771
- He practically said
he loved you on television!
- I know.

631
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,139
Hi, girls. Hi.

632
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:01,017
Take my picture.
Here, take my picture.

633
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:05,488
I gotta go to work.
You understand that?

634
00:41:07,658 --> 00:41:10,650
I am really gonna
get hurt this time.

635
00:41:10,728 --> 00:41:14,494
Here we go, girls.
I'm goin' to work. Bye.

636
00:41:14,565 --> 00:41:17,557
Yeah, Doc,
I stopped payment on the plugs.

637
00:41:17,635 --> 00:41:20,103
You gave me doll hair!

638
00:41:20,171 --> 00:41:22,141
I'll hold.

639
00:41:26,078 --> 00:41:28,911
- Okay, now I'll tell you something else.
- Yeah.

640
00:41:28,981 --> 00:41:33,213
- The old guy in the wheelchair,
the stepfather?
- Yeah.

641
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:35,879
They're gonna have him die.

642
00:41:37,189 --> 00:41:40,181
That was Whitaker on the phone.

643
00:41:40,259 --> 00:41:44,992
I'm gonna have to scrub my ass
because he's on his way over to kiss it.

644
00:41:46,598 --> 00:41:49,158
Hey, bring it on in, buddy.

645
00:41:49,234 --> 00:41:52,226
That's right, come on.

646
00:41:53,572 --> 00:41:56,939
A little further. Come on.
All right, perfect, man.

647
00:41:58,343 --> 00:42:01,540
- I got my own parking spot now?
- It's all for you, Ed.

648
00:42:01,613 --> 00:42:04,639
- How's it going, man?
- Good, Mark, how are you?

649
00:42:04,716 --> 00:42:07,844
- Thanks, man.
- Ed, you're the best, man.

650
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,945
- Hi, Mom.
- Saw you last night. Lookin' good, man.

651
00:42:10,022 --> 00:42:12,320
Hi, Ed.

652
00:42:12,391 --> 00:42:14,985
Ray! Man, I've been
lookin' all over for you.

653
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,927
Listen, I know I got
some explaining to do.

654
00:42:17,996 --> 00:42:20,556
Just let me do
what I came here to do.

655
00:42:20,632 --> 00:42:22,600
What, do you want to fight?

656
00:42:24,636 --> 00:42:27,434
Cassie. Cassie, come on.

657
00:42:27,506 --> 00:42:29,940
- This is really hard.
- You promised.

658
00:42:30,008 --> 00:42:34,342
- What are you doing, Ray?
- Go ahead.

659
00:42:34,413 --> 00:42:38,713
I went out with Ray
a few years ago...

660
00:42:38,784 --> 00:42:40,843
for a couple of months,

661
00:42:40,919 --> 00:42:43,513
and we were intimate.

662
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:50,189
And... he's really not as bad
as that girl said he was.

663
00:42:50,262 --> 00:42:53,595
- I mean, I've definitely had worse.
- That's enough.

664
00:42:53,665 --> 00:42:56,634
I think we did what we came here for.

665
00:42:56,702 --> 00:43:00,103
- Good-bye, brother.
- No, no, come on, Ray!

666
00:43:00,172 --> 00:43:01,571
Vindicated!

667
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,269
Ray, what are you...

668
00:43:05,344 --> 00:43:07,312
I'm in the bathroom. Go ahead.

669
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:09,438
Sorry we're calling so late.

670
00:43:09,514 --> 00:43:13,575
- It's this is the only time we
get to talk to you off camera.
- It's cool, Cynthia, I was up.

671
00:43:13,652 --> 00:43:15,984
Ed, why didn't you go
see Shari today, man?

672
00:43:16,054 --> 00:43:19,990
- That's what everybody
was hoping you'd do.
- I wanted to, but...

673
00:43:20,058 --> 00:43:24,461
Is it about Ray? Because Ray is
not a problem. He cheated on Shari.

674
00:43:24,529 --> 00:43:28,158
That's right, Ed. Viewers don't like
Ray. The research says females...

675
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:31,794
No, hey, guys,
it's not Ray. Okay?

676
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:35,362
- Cynthia?
- Yes, Ed?

677
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,568
You got a second?
Can I talk to you alone for a second?

678
00:43:38,644 --> 00:43:42,876
Absolutely, yeah. Why don't you guys
take off? I'll see you in the morning.

679
00:43:42,948 --> 00:43:45,940
- Okay, see you later.
- All right, I'll see you later.

680
00:43:46,018 --> 00:43:48,953
Good-bye. All right.
See you later.

681
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:52,413
Ed, how's it goin'?

682
00:43:52,491 --> 00:43:57,428
I'm good, you know? I'm, I'm good.
Everything's... Everything's cool.

683
00:43:57,496 --> 00:44:00,329
Did you decide you don't
really like Shari that much?

684
00:44:00,399 --> 00:44:03,926
No! N-N-N-No!
Listen, that's not it at all.

685
00:44:04,002 --> 00:44:07,665
I like Shari plenty.
Shari is... Oh, man.

686
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:10,970
- Shari's great.
- Yeah?

687
00:44:13,545 --> 00:44:16,105
Look, Cynthia,
how's this gonna work?

688
00:44:16,181 --> 00:44:20,481
What, are we gonna date on TV?
She's not gonna like that.

689
00:44:20,552 --> 00:44:24,352
- If you don't call her, you're
not really giving her a choice.
- Okay.

690
00:44:24,423 --> 00:44:26,653
- Ed?
- What?

691
00:44:26,725 --> 00:44:31,253
- Can I give you some advice
about women?
- Sure.

692
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:34,697
Women want to be pursued.

693
00:44:34,766 --> 00:44:36,859
Yes, but...

694
00:44:36,935 --> 00:44:39,028
- Ed?
- Huh?

695
00:44:39,104 --> 00:44:41,504
What would Burt do?

696
00:44:55,721 --> 00:45:00,021
This is so exciting.
A real celebrity delivering my figs.

697
00:45:00,092 --> 00:45:02,890
Yeah. Okay, if you would
just sign right here, please.

698
00:45:02,961 --> 00:45:07,227
Ray's a pig. That Ed is a doll.
Latch onto him, honey.

699
00:45:07,299 --> 00:45:09,767
Okay. Just sign right there
in the black area, please.

700
00:45:09,835 --> 00:45:14,465
It wouldn't kill you to use more makeup
on television. You look washed out.

701
00:45:14,539 --> 00:45:17,599
- What would I actually have to do
do get you to sign this?
- Uh-huh.

702
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:21,476
On television a minute,
and already you got an attitude.

703
00:45:22,547 --> 00:45:24,572
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

704
00:45:27,552 --> 00:45:29,247
Hi.

705
00:45:29,321 --> 00:45:33,690
- What are you doing?
- I missed you.

706
00:45:33,759 --> 00:45:36,091
Really?

707
00:45:36,161 --> 00:45:38,288
I...

708
00:45:44,269 --> 00:45:46,965
Wow. I've never seen you
in uniform before.

709
00:45:47,038 --> 00:45:48,972
Yeah, well...

710
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,737
It's really quite a turnoff.

711
00:45:52,811 --> 00:45:54,540
Thank you.

712
00:45:54,613 --> 00:45:58,481
Listen, Sunday night
at the Sharks game,

713
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,541
I'm gonna be driving the Zamboni.

714
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:03,281
- The what?
- That big machine that cleans
the ice, you know?

715
00:46:03,355 --> 00:46:08,292
It's quite an honor.
Will you go with me?

716
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:18,234
Say, look, I know
this is weird, Shari,

717
00:46:18,303 --> 00:46:22,034
but I don't want to wait.

718
00:46:22,107 --> 00:46:24,041
I don't.

719
00:46:24,109 --> 00:46:27,101
I really think we might
have something here.

720
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,114
Don't you?

721
00:46:36,555 --> 00:46:39,615
- Oh, these are for you.
- Thank you.

722
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,985
So will you be my Zamboni date?

723
00:46:44,062 --> 00:46:46,326
Huh?

724
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:49,599
- Yes.
- All right.

725
00:46:55,140 --> 00:47:00,043
- Cynthia, this is great.
This is exploitable!
- It's perfect.

726
00:47:00,111 --> 00:47:02,011
Yeah, well.

727
00:47:04,883 --> 00:47:09,115
Ladies and gentlemen, Ed Pekurny!

728
00:47:09,187 --> 00:47:11,178
Whoo!

729
00:47:11,256 --> 00:47:13,349
Whoo!

730
00:47:16,061 --> 00:47:19,656
Where's my girl? Where's my girl?
There she is!

731
00:47:19,731 --> 00:47:21,824
Shari!

732
00:47:23,869 --> 00:47:27,532
Let's go, Ed!
Let's go, Ed!

733
00:47:38,683 --> 00:47:40,617
There are girls

734
00:47:40,685 --> 00:47:42,915
Just ripe for some kissin'

735
00:47:42,988 --> 00:47:44,922
And I mean

736
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:47,550
To kiss me a few

737
00:47:47,626 --> 00:47:52,029
Man, those chicks don't know
what they're missing

738
00:47:52,097 --> 00:47:54,588
- Ow! Don't kick me in the shin.
- Don't make fun of him!

739
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:56,759
Living to do

740
00:47:56,835 --> 00:48:00,066
Sizzlin' steaks all ready

741
00:48:00,138 --> 00:48:02,003
For tastin'

742
00:48:02,073 --> 00:48:06,669
And those Cadillacs
all shiny and new

743
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,874
Oh, my God, Ed, look!

744
00:48:13,285 --> 00:48:14,920
Got a lot of living to do

745
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:15,579
Got a lot of living to do

746
00:48:17,756 --> 00:48:19,690
Hey, it's Ed!

747
00:48:22,225 --> 00:48:24,750
Good evening, Ken.
How's it goin'?

748
00:48:24,828 --> 00:48:29,697
How's it goin'? The girl I'm seeing
is dancing with that guy right there.

749
00:48:29,766 --> 00:48:31,734
Good night.

750
00:48:31,801 --> 00:48:34,531
Oh, my God, it's Ed!

751
00:48:34,604 --> 00:48:37,072
- Eddie!
- You're the man, Ed!

752
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:39,631
My man Ed! Ed!

753
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:41,677
Look at this.
How cool is this?

754
00:48:41,744 --> 00:48:45,680
He's a Beatle. Well, he's not
a Beatle, but he's a Spice Girl,

755
00:48:45,748 --> 00:48:47,648
or a Beanie Baby.

756
00:48:47,717 --> 00:48:50,618
He's Menudo!

757
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:53,986
Hey, Shari, lucky lady!
I want to be on TV with you.

758
00:48:54,057 --> 00:48:56,617
Look over there at that monitor.

759
00:48:56,693 --> 00:48:58,786
- Stop it!
- Who do you think you are?
Just take a picture.

760
00:49:01,831 --> 00:49:04,664
Shari!

761
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:07,567
Move, move, get out of the goddamn way!
Come here! Come here!

762
00:49:07,637 --> 00:49:10,504
Shari!

763
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:13,167
Hold on, I got you. Back off!

764
00:49:13,243 --> 00:49:17,441
I got you. Back, back!

765
00:49:17,514 --> 00:49:19,448
You okay, baby?

766
00:49:21,718 --> 00:49:22,952
Okay, we're gonna take a break now.
Just take five.

767
00:49:22,952 --> 00:49:25,546
Okay, we're gonna take a break now.
Just take five.

768
00:49:29,526 --> 00:49:32,017
Are you okay?

769
00:49:32,095 --> 00:49:34,461
Oh, wow. You went down.

770
00:49:34,531 --> 00:49:36,931
I lost an earring.

771
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,628
You think you can go out
and get it?

772
00:49:39,702 --> 00:49:44,036
- Yeah, I'll get it.
- No, I'm just kidding.

773
00:49:44,107 --> 00:49:47,668
- You're kiddin'?
- Just kidding. Would you really do that?

774
00:49:47,744 --> 00:49:51,578
Yeah, I'd do that.
I mean, if you wanted... your earring.

775
00:49:51,648 --> 00:49:56,915
I didn't wanna make a scene

776
00:49:58,655 --> 00:50:02,056
But you were there

777
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:05,686
I saw you slip away

778
00:50:05,762 --> 00:50:09,163
You were everything good to me

779
00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:15,699
I saw you slip away

780
00:50:15,772 --> 00:50:19,833
You were everything good to me

781
00:50:19,909 --> 00:50:23,140
Oh, wow, that's
the new camera truck, huh?

782
00:50:23,213 --> 00:50:25,875
Look at my enormous head.

783
00:50:25,949 --> 00:50:29,009
Anyway, Cynthia,
last night, that was scary.

784
00:50:29,118 --> 00:50:32,679
Don't worry about that.
That won't happen again.
We're getting you security.

785
00:50:32,755 --> 00:50:35,519
- Good.
- I have some news for you.

786
00:50:35,592 --> 00:50:40,859
- What's that?
- We're picking up Ed TV
for another month.

787
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:42,830
Say that again.

788
00:50:42,899 --> 00:50:44,730
We're picking you up
for another month.

789
00:50:44,801 --> 00:50:47,929
That means a balloon payment
and a big raise next month.

790
00:50:48,004 --> 00:50:50,598
Are you tellin' me
that the balloon payment,

791
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:52,834
- I'm gonna get that?
- Yeah.

792
00:50:52,909 --> 00:50:54,843
Oh!

793
00:50:56,279 --> 00:50:58,213
Here we go.

794
00:51:00,116 --> 00:51:02,846
Thank you! Oh, man,
this is incredible.

795
00:51:02,919 --> 00:51:04,978
This is amazing!

796
00:51:05,054 --> 00:51:08,182
Yes! Another month
and a balloon payment!

797
00:51:08,258 --> 00:51:10,226
Ray, if you're watching...

798
00:51:10,293 --> 00:51:12,591
- Who the hell'd be watching this.
- Did you hear this?

799
00:51:12,729 --> 00:51:16,688
I got the payment, buddy. This money's
for you! To pay back that loan!

800
00:51:16,766 --> 00:51:19,200
It's for you, brother! Come on.

801
00:51:19,269 --> 00:51:23,467
What do we do when we're happy?
Chicken dance, baby.

802
00:51:25,174 --> 00:51:27,870
Come on, I know you're doin' it
wherever you are.

803
00:51:27,944 --> 00:51:30,071
If I was doin' it,
I wouldn't do it like that.

804
00:51:30,146 --> 00:51:32,876
I'm on for another month

805
00:51:36,653 --> 00:51:39,087
Faster

806
00:51:40,323 --> 00:51:42,985
Fingers start shakin'

807
00:51:46,095 --> 00:51:48,723
Everybody back up, please.

808
00:51:52,502 --> 00:51:54,834
Please, clear a path to the car.

809
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:56,633
Get off, man.

810
00:52:04,147 --> 00:52:07,674
Four weeks ago, no one in America
had ever heard of Ed Pekurny.

811
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,241
Today this 31-year-old
video store clerk...

812
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:14,916
has become something of an American
icon, a national obsession.

813
00:52:14,991 --> 00:52:17,323
Honestly?

814
00:52:17,393 --> 00:52:20,851
I try not to go to the bathroom
until Ed goes to the bathroom...

815
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,091
so I don't miss anything.

816
00:52:23,166 --> 00:52:28,297
- The idea just came to me.
- Sure, it came to you
because I brought it to you.

817
00:52:28,371 --> 00:52:32,330
I'm not a... I'm not a guy who works
by committee. I'm a one-man show.

818
00:52:32,408 --> 00:52:34,535
What do you guys
think about Shari?

819
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,544
She's needy!
I don't like her.

820
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:39,172
She's too tall.
It's, like, abnormal.

821
00:52:39,248 --> 00:52:43,184
Yeah. She creeps me out.
She's always, "Get away!"

822
00:52:43,252 --> 00:52:45,186
I mean,
who does she think she is?

823
00:52:45,254 --> 00:52:47,381
I know!
And she's so bony!

824
00:52:47,457 --> 00:52:50,722
Like to me, this Shari's
like nothing, right?

825
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:53,921
She's not even hot.
I mean, Ed's a celebrity.

826
00:52:53,996 --> 00:52:56,487
If that was me,
I'd be dating the goods.

827
00:52:56,566 --> 00:52:59,899
There's like something wrong with her.
She's definitely not hot.

828
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:02,062
Not hot, not hot. No way.

829
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:04,072
She is a heat-free being.

830
00:53:06,142 --> 00:53:08,440
Hello? Hi, here you go.

831
00:53:08,511 --> 00:53:09,978
Oh, hi, yeah. I've been
waiting for this. Thank you.

832
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:13,111
- Y'all watching Ed TV, right?
- Sign right here, please.

833
00:53:13,182 --> 00:53:17,551
What's up with Shari? Ed's girlfriend,
Shari? What is up with that bitch?

834
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:20,111
Ed, honey, look,

835
00:53:20,189 --> 00:53:23,920
when you get tired
of that skanky ho,

836
00:53:23,993 --> 00:53:26,052
come see me, baby.

837
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,667
Check out the moves!

838
00:53:39,742 --> 00:53:41,505
Watch this one.

839
00:53:41,577 --> 00:53:44,444
Oh, she's down.

840
00:53:44,514 --> 00:53:46,448
Get outta here.

841
00:53:46,516 --> 00:53:47,744
Shari!

842
00:53:47,817 --> 00:53:49,751
Whoo!

843
00:53:49,819 --> 00:53:51,582
Hi.

844
00:53:51,654 --> 00:53:55,181
Come pile on!
Set down the groceries.

845
00:53:57,693 --> 00:53:59,627
Come here!

846
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:02,095
Where're you goin', baby?

847
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,969
No, we're not gonna
do it today, Shari.

848
00:54:07,036 --> 00:54:11,837
- I'm gonna go get ready.
- Baby! Hey, is everything all right?

849
00:54:11,908 --> 00:54:15,139
My truck broke down,
and I got stuck in the rain.

850
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:18,703
I called the company,
and no one came to get me.

851
00:54:18,781 --> 00:54:20,715
- Rita!
- Just a second.

852
00:54:20,783 --> 00:54:26,119
- Don't they give you a hat?
- Some dorky kid stole it as a souvenir.

853
00:54:26,189 --> 00:54:28,521
That sucks.

854
00:54:28,591 --> 00:54:33,051
I'm kinda glad that he did,
'cause, goddamn, you look sexy.

855
00:54:35,665 --> 00:54:38,600
Ed, I don't wanna be
on television anymore.

856
00:54:41,771 --> 00:54:43,636
Shari, how's that gonna work?

857
00:54:43,706 --> 00:54:45,867
I have been trying, okay?

858
00:54:50,146 --> 00:54:53,582
But maybe we should just
hold off on seeing each other...

859
00:54:53,649 --> 00:54:58,586
until you are done
with all of this.

860
00:55:02,191 --> 00:55:04,523
You're outta there, baby!
All right? Yeah!

861
00:55:04,594 --> 00:55:06,789
I knew it was gonna happen!
I told you!

862
00:55:06,863 --> 00:55:09,855
- That's a little extreme, isn't it?
- I can't take it anymore.

863
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:14,096
- I have no privacy.
- Oh, boo-hoo.

864
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:17,606
Even now I'm crying, and I can't stop,
and they won't leave.

865
00:55:17,673 --> 00:55:19,800
And now it's gonna be
another month!

866
00:55:19,876 --> 00:55:23,334
- Everybody hates me.
- Nobody hates you. Why are you...

867
00:55:23,412 --> 00:55:25,710
- Who hates you?
- A poll, Ed!

868
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:29,046
U.S.A. Today:
"Is Shari Good Enough For Ed?"

869
00:55:29,118 --> 00:55:31,951
Seventy-one percent
of the people said no.

870
00:55:32,021 --> 00:55:34,649
Who cares about what they say?
I don't care.

871
00:55:34,724 --> 00:55:38,421
No, I do care. You know what?
Shame on everybody!

872
00:55:38,494 --> 00:55:41,486
She's cryin' over here,
and it's all your fault.

873
00:55:41,564 --> 00:55:45,125
At least the 71% of you.
The other...

874
00:55:45,201 --> 00:55:49,297
- Twenty-nine.
- Twenty-nine percent.

875
00:55:49,372 --> 00:55:52,933
You're smart!
Isn't she smart?

876
00:55:53,009 --> 00:55:55,671
God, she's sexy with
the wet hair and everything.

877
00:55:55,745 --> 00:55:57,679
And she's funny.

878
00:55:57,747 --> 00:56:02,150
She's really funny, too.
She really is!

879
00:56:02,218 --> 00:56:07,485
Oh! Shari, do that, that Love Coroner
skit you did at the pool hall.

880
00:56:07,557 --> 00:56:11,725
It's so fucking great. It's great.
Okay. Okay, baby? Set?

881
00:56:11,858 --> 00:56:13,792
Back up, get a wide shot
of this, okay.

882
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:15,885
All right, baby, remember...
Whoo-whoo-whoo.

883
00:56:15,962 --> 00:56:18,897
That's the punch line, all right?
You got a whole runway.

884
00:56:18,965 --> 00:56:22,264
Are you set to pop?
Ones and twos and... Look right here.

885
00:56:27,407 --> 00:56:31,343
What... are you doing?

886
00:56:31,411 --> 00:56:33,709
Do the thing.
Do the skit, you know.

887
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:37,079
You want me to entertain
your audience?

888
00:56:39,786 --> 00:56:42,380
What is this, Ed?
An audition to be your girlfriend...

889
00:56:42,455 --> 00:56:45,686
because I'm not good enough for you?

890
00:56:45,759 --> 00:56:49,786
No! Shari, that's not it!
Come on, Shari!

891
00:56:49,863 --> 00:56:54,391
- Psycho chick.
- Damaged goods, bro. Do not accept, man.

892
00:56:54,467 --> 00:56:57,698
Man, this is stupid.
"Is Shari Good Enough For Ed?"

893
00:56:57,771 --> 00:57:00,968
Who the hell am I, huh?
Who do you think I should be dating?

894
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,940
There's a list!

895
00:57:04,344 --> 00:57:06,278
Really?

896
00:57:16,923 --> 00:57:18,857
Ed?

897
00:57:22,195 --> 00:57:24,129
Goddamn.

898
00:57:24,197 --> 00:57:26,165
The whole Shari thing,
is that over?

899
00:57:26,232 --> 00:57:28,962
You gonna be showing up on the History
Channel? What's happening?

900
00:57:29,035 --> 00:57:32,801
- Well, no, we're on hold.
- On hold?

901
00:57:32,872 --> 00:57:35,636
Is she a phone call?
Is she listening to Yanni music?

902
00:57:35,708 --> 00:57:38,700
You're gonna get back to her?
Who puts a woman on hold?

903
00:57:38,778 --> 00:57:42,270
We're gonna wait till this is over,
and then we're gonna pick it back up.

904
00:57:44,284 --> 00:57:46,218
I guess this is the famous Carlos...

905
00:57:46,286 --> 00:57:48,220
who follows you everywhere?

906
00:57:54,561 --> 00:57:56,495
Aiyee!

907
00:57:56,563 --> 00:58:00,124
What I want to ask you,
what is this chicken dance?

908
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,225
Y'all know the chicken dance?

909
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:06,165
Okay, so let's do it!

910
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:09,174
Have I got it?
Is this how you do it?

911
00:58:09,242 --> 00:58:13,235
- No, you gotta get your foot out.
- This is a lot of fun.

912
00:58:13,313 --> 00:58:17,079
Ed Pekurny! We'll be
right back after this.

913
00:58:21,454 --> 00:58:23,388
Hey, can I have another hat
for my dad?

914
00:58:23,456 --> 00:58:25,390
- I've got your car ready right here.
- Cool.

915
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:28,621
- Can you get us sodas for
the ride to the airport?
- Yeah. Coke or Pepsi?

916
00:58:28,695 --> 00:58:31,755
- Uh, Pepsi.
- Can I talk to you for a second, man?

917
00:58:31,831 --> 00:58:34,322
- Yeah. What's up?
- My name is Shane.

918
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,369
- How you doin'? What's this, man?
- This is a tape of my band.

919
00:58:37,437 --> 00:58:41,533
I thought maybe
you could play it on your show.

920
00:58:41,608 --> 00:58:45,442
- Oh, man, come on.
- One of the guys is blind.

921
00:58:46,946 --> 00:58:50,279
All right, I'll give it a listen.

922
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:52,784
The name of the band is
"Not All Of Us Can See."

923
00:58:52,852 --> 00:58:54,786
- Terrific name.
- "Not All Of Us Can See."

924
00:58:54,854 --> 00:58:58,312
"Not All Of You Can See."
What the hell is that?

925
00:58:58,391 --> 00:59:00,325
For the love of sweet...

926
00:59:00,393 --> 00:59:04,159
- Jesus Christ!
- Really.

927
00:59:10,236 --> 00:59:12,170
- Hi.
- Hi.

928
00:59:12,238 --> 00:59:15,298
Um, I wanted to say
I really love your show.

929
00:59:15,375 --> 00:59:17,343
- I think you're great.
- Wow. Thank you.

930
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:20,140
That's a really cool thing
to say. I'm Ed.

931
00:59:20,213 --> 00:59:22,704
And you must be... John?

932
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:26,910
I... I'm trying to remember.

933
00:59:26,986 --> 00:59:31,855
- Oh, yes.
- I'm Jill. I'm from San Francisco too.

934
00:59:31,925 --> 00:59:36,259
Right. The Bay Area.
I can tell by the accent.

935
00:59:39,465 --> 00:59:42,559
Ta, ta, ta, ta.
Ya, ya, ya.

936
00:59:42,635 --> 00:59:45,832
- Ya, ya, ya.
- Uh, what should I ask?

937
00:59:45,905 --> 00:59:47,896
So, wh... what are you
doing here?

938
00:59:47,974 --> 00:59:51,410
I just flew down
to audition for a skit.

939
00:59:51,477 --> 00:59:54,071
All right.

940
00:59:54,147 --> 00:59:58,049
I'm a model and
sort of an actress, so, um...

941
00:59:58,117 --> 01:00:02,679
Um, oh... So really,
it was nice meeting you.

942
01:00:02,755 --> 01:00:05,883
Oh, yeah.
No, you too. Um...

943
01:00:05,959 --> 01:00:11,022
They were supposed to send a car
to take me to the airport, but, um...

944
01:00:11,097 --> 01:00:13,622
I'll tell you what. We gotta...

945
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:16,260
We're going to the airport right now.
Got a limo outside.

946
01:00:16,336 --> 01:00:18,270
Why don't you ride with us?

947
01:00:18,338 --> 01:00:20,704
Oh. Yeah. That'd be great.

948
01:00:20,773 --> 01:00:23,071
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

949
01:00:23,142 --> 01:00:25,906
All right.

950
01:00:28,781 --> 01:00:30,646
But that's life

951
01:00:34,053 --> 01:00:35,987
What the people say

952
01:00:36,055 --> 01:00:39,491
Excuse me.
Comin' through.

953
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:42,551
- We're ridin' high in April
- Take all you want. It's free.

954
01:00:42,628 --> 01:00:44,858
Shot down in May

955
01:00:44,931 --> 01:00:47,161
Tawny.

956
01:00:47,233 --> 01:00:50,259
Huh. Hey, Carlos.

957
01:00:50,336 --> 01:00:53,100
These go in the nude picture pile.

958
01:00:53,172 --> 01:00:55,163
What do we got here?

959
01:00:57,477 --> 01:00:59,502
Oh, this is cute.

960
01:00:59,579 --> 01:01:02,013
This goes in
the psychopath file.

961
01:01:02,081 --> 01:01:04,481
Oh.

962
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:07,451
Hope it's not this guy.

963
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,147
Be right there!

964
01:01:09,222 --> 01:01:12,316
Hello. Hey, Moe,
what's goin' on?

965
01:01:12,392 --> 01:01:15,691
Ed, this guy says he knows you.

966
01:01:15,762 --> 01:01:18,595
- Hey. How you doin'?
- Hey.

967
01:01:24,504 --> 01:01:26,768
You don't recognize me?

968
01:01:26,839 --> 01:01:29,205
Dad?

969
01:01:29,275 --> 01:01:31,835
Yeah. Yeah.

970
01:01:34,781 --> 01:01:38,342
- Did you do this? Did you
find him and tell him...
- No, no way.

971
01:01:38,418 --> 01:01:41,114
Come on... Come on in.

972
01:01:41,187 --> 01:01:43,280
Yeah, okay.

973
01:01:43,356 --> 01:01:45,017
Goddamn!

974
01:01:45,091 --> 01:01:48,822
- Everybody, this is Hank, my dad.
- This just keeps getting better.

975
01:01:48,895 --> 01:01:51,796
What you're sayin', Ma, is that
everything he told me yesterday...

976
01:01:51,864 --> 01:01:55,322
- was a lie.
- Yes... practically.

977
01:01:58,171 --> 01:02:00,230
What do you mean,
"practically"?

978
01:02:00,306 --> 01:02:03,241
Either you threw him out
or he ran away. Which one is it?

979
01:02:03,309 --> 01:02:05,243
I need to replace the coil.

980
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:07,802
He ran away after I threw him out.

981
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:10,678
- How much is one of those new coils?
- A hundred fifty bucks.

982
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:12,718
- He was telling the truth.
- Should I go ahead?

983
01:02:12,785 --> 01:02:16,050
- Yes.
- Yes to me, or yes to the coil?

984
01:02:16,122 --> 01:02:19,216
- Both.
- Oh, shit.

985
01:02:19,292 --> 01:02:23,661
- Look, he had girlfriends.
- He told me he had this one girl.

986
01:02:23,729 --> 01:02:28,029
I really do not need to relive this on
national television. I am your mother.

987
01:02:28,101 --> 01:02:30,535
- Yes, you are my mother.
- Do not humiliate me like this!

988
01:02:30,603 --> 01:02:33,731
- I'm not trying to humiliate you.
- I don't need this! Go away!

989
01:02:33,806 --> 01:02:35,774
Eddie?

990
01:02:35,842 --> 01:02:40,973
Make this out to Dr. Rumpley.
Maybe the son of a bitch won't
keep me waiting for an hour.

991
01:02:41,047 --> 01:02:43,538
Damn neurologists think
they run the world.

992
01:02:43,616 --> 01:02:46,551
She does this every time.

993
01:02:46,619 --> 01:02:49,782
- All right, do you want
to know the truth?
- Yeah.

994
01:02:49,856 --> 01:02:54,418
I took you, Ray and Marcia to my
sister's on the train for the weekend.

995
01:02:54,494 --> 01:02:59,397
You all came down with chicken pox,
so I took you home a day early.

996
01:02:59,465 --> 01:03:02,025
And I walked in,
and there was your father...

997
01:03:02,101 --> 01:03:05,036
with another women
in our bed, okay.

998
01:03:05,104 --> 01:03:08,665
Chicken pox.
I was six when I had chicken pox,

999
01:03:08,741 --> 01:03:13,075
- and Dad didn't leave until I was 12.
- Well, he apologized.

1000
01:03:13,146 --> 01:03:16,172
- What do you mean, he apologized?
- He begged me.

1001
01:03:16,249 --> 01:03:18,444
He got down on his knees
and he begged me.

1002
01:03:18,518 --> 01:03:21,146
But, Mom, you told me
that you had a hysterectomy,

1003
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:23,984
and that he ran off
with your nurse.

1004
01:03:25,158 --> 01:03:27,149
She could've been a nurse.

1005
01:03:27,226 --> 01:03:30,423
- What do you mean,
could've been a nurse?
- She had white shoes.

1006
01:03:30,496 --> 01:03:33,954
So does Grandma!
So does Shaquille O'Neal!

1007
01:03:35,134 --> 01:03:37,125
- That's good.
- What's the difference?

1008
01:03:37,203 --> 01:03:40,138
The difference is that for 20 years
I've been thinking one thing,

1009
01:03:40,206 --> 01:03:43,972
- and now it's turned out
to be a whole different thing!
- Eddie.

1010
01:03:44,043 --> 01:03:48,446
He was no good to me.
Don't you remember the way it was?

1011
01:03:48,514 --> 01:03:51,779
Don't you remember the way
he used to scream at me?

1012
01:03:51,851 --> 01:03:54,513
And then no job was ever
good enough for him.

1013
01:03:54,587 --> 01:03:58,489
"Small potatoes."
You remember, Al?

1014
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:03,829
Al?

1015
01:04:09,501 --> 01:04:11,435
Mom,

1016
01:04:11,503 --> 01:04:15,599
you told me you didn't know Al
until after Dad left.

1017
01:04:19,044 --> 01:04:21,205
Holy shit.

1018
01:04:23,849 --> 01:04:25,976
You and Al were...

1019
01:04:27,252 --> 01:04:31,154
And that's why you threw Dad out.
There it is!

1020
01:04:31,223 --> 01:04:34,454
Finally the truth
after 20 goddamn years, Mom?

1021
01:04:34,526 --> 01:04:37,154
He had another woman
in my bed, Eddie!

1022
01:04:37,229 --> 01:04:42,189
And how dare you call him "dad"
in front of Al. Al is your father.

1023
01:04:42,267 --> 01:04:45,566
This is the one who was there for you
when you really needed someone.

1024
01:04:45,637 --> 01:04:48,697
Ow! You're hurting me.

1025
01:04:48,773 --> 01:04:51,003
Oh, Jeanette.

1026
01:04:51,076 --> 01:04:53,010
Oh, Mom.

1027
01:04:55,213 --> 01:04:59,479
Don't blame your mother.
I was irresistible.

1028
01:05:10,028 --> 01:05:11,962
Well, come on in.

1029
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:14,260
How are you doin'?

1030
01:05:14,332 --> 01:05:17,460
- All right.
- All right. Well...

1031
01:05:17,535 --> 01:05:21,369
- You?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm, I'm fine.

1032
01:05:23,275 --> 01:05:25,937
I guess you came up here
to check on your inheritance.

1033
01:05:26,011 --> 01:05:28,172
Did ya?

1034
01:05:29,714 --> 01:05:33,150
Come right over here.
You sit right down there.

1035
01:05:33,218 --> 01:05:35,186
There you go.

1036
01:05:35,253 --> 01:05:38,279
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1037
01:05:38,356 --> 01:05:43,851
This is, uh,
quite a shithole, ain't it?

1038
01:05:43,929 --> 01:05:46,693
Well, it could be...
if you fixed it up.

1039
01:05:48,934 --> 01:05:51,903
- Jeanette, you better
take a look at this.
- Okay.

1040
01:05:51,970 --> 01:05:55,303
- Oh, boy.
- You know, it is really nice of you...

1041
01:05:55,373 --> 01:05:58,137
to come up here.

1042
01:05:58,209 --> 01:06:02,111
A million times I wanted
to see you kids, but, uh, well...

1043
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:06,241
I mean, your mom,
she told me to stay away.

1044
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:09,378
And I had to respect
her wishes.

1045
01:06:11,556 --> 01:06:14,855
- Can I ask you somethin'?
- Anything.

1046
01:06:19,264 --> 01:06:23,792
What happened, Pop?
I mean, how'd you end up...

1047
01:06:23,868 --> 01:06:27,998
- like this?
- You know, life is funny. That's all.

1048
01:06:28,073 --> 01:06:30,871
I can't tell you
how many times if...

1049
01:06:30,942 --> 01:06:33,911
just one little thing
that I needed would've happened,

1050
01:06:33,979 --> 01:06:36,948
why, everything would've changed,
I'll tell you that.

1051
01:06:37,015 --> 01:06:38,949
But I don't make excuses.

1052
01:06:39,017 --> 01:06:41,417
And I don't hold grudges.

1053
01:06:41,486 --> 01:06:44,785
You and me, we had some good times
together, didn't we? Huh?

1054
01:06:47,926 --> 01:06:51,453
Remember the time we drove
down to Houston for the weekend,

1055
01:06:51,529 --> 01:06:54,191
and we saw the Astros
and the Dodgers play?

1056
01:06:54,265 --> 01:06:57,632
We stayed in a motel.
It was just you and me.

1057
01:06:57,702 --> 01:07:00,933
You hopped from bed to bed.

1058
01:07:01,006 --> 01:07:04,237
I remember that
just like it was yesterday.

1059
01:07:04,309 --> 01:07:08,302
I remember everything you said
and everything you did.

1060
01:07:09,781 --> 01:07:12,306
- That was Ray, Pop.
- Hmm?

1061
01:07:12,384 --> 01:07:15,148
You took Ray to Houston.

1062
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:19,213
It wasn't me. I had to stay home...
with Mom and Marcia.

1063
01:07:22,827 --> 01:07:24,988
That's right. Ray.

1064
01:07:25,063 --> 01:07:27,463
Ray was the older one.

1065
01:07:27,532 --> 01:07:29,557
Still is.

1066
01:07:31,936 --> 01:07:33,870
Yeah.

1067
01:07:33,938 --> 01:07:37,237
Well,

1068
01:07:37,308 --> 01:07:39,776
isn't that something?

1069
01:07:39,844 --> 01:07:42,176
Damn the mind!

1070
01:07:42,247 --> 01:07:44,181
I gotta go, Pop.

1071
01:07:44,249 --> 01:07:48,185
- I got a thing across town
I gotta get to.
- Sure, son, sure.

1072
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:54,854
You know what?

1073
01:07:54,926 --> 01:07:57,588
Listen up.
This is my pop. All right?

1074
01:07:57,662 --> 01:08:00,096
If there's anybody out there
that can help him out...

1075
01:08:00,165 --> 01:08:04,192
- Get him a job or something...
- I drove a limo for a while.

1076
01:08:04,269 --> 01:08:06,863
I'll help you out.
I'll mention your business on the air...

1077
01:08:06,938 --> 01:08:08,872
I don't have a valid license.

1078
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:12,239
We'll figure something out,
all right?

1079
01:08:14,112 --> 01:08:16,046
- All right.
- Ed.

1080
01:08:17,415 --> 01:08:20,111
Yeah.

1081
01:08:20,185 --> 01:08:22,676
I am truly sorry.

1082
01:08:30,261 --> 01:08:33,560
That's good, Pop.
Sorry's good.

1083
01:09:21,513 --> 01:09:26,075
As soon as we're perpendicular to
the Earth, I'll start the engines again.

1084
01:09:26,151 --> 01:09:28,244
What about the disk?

1085
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:39,025
Oh, God. Boy, oh, boy.

1086
01:09:46,538 --> 01:09:49,632
Hi.

1087
01:09:49,707 --> 01:09:51,641
Hey.

1088
01:09:53,011 --> 01:09:56,276
- They're not here.
- How's that?

1089
01:09:56,347 --> 01:09:59,111
I snuck out.

1090
01:10:02,921 --> 01:10:05,116
You wanna take a drive?

1091
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:07,715
- Sure.
- Okay.

1092
01:10:07,859 --> 01:10:10,589
Now Pop's hustling me for a job.

1093
01:10:10,662 --> 01:10:14,996
It's like my entire family, Shari.
It's like they're from
their own little galaxy.

1094
01:10:15,066 --> 01:10:17,830
Every family's crazy.

1095
01:10:17,902 --> 01:10:20,632
- Yeah, but my...
- No, I mean,

1096
01:10:20,705 --> 01:10:24,801
if it was my family on TV,

1097
01:10:24,876 --> 01:10:28,368
oh, my God, I'd have
to kill myself!

1098
01:10:41,459 --> 01:10:46,328
How about us?
We're doing all right, aren't we?

1099
01:10:48,433 --> 01:10:53,564
I saw that girl come on to you
at The Tonight Show.

1100
01:10:53,638 --> 01:10:56,038
- Wh... What girl?
- That model.

1101
01:10:59,177 --> 01:11:01,737
Oh, wait a minute.
Shari, that was nothin'.

1102
01:11:01,813 --> 01:11:04,941
I was leaving, she needed
a ride to the airport,

1103
01:11:05,016 --> 01:11:08,816
so I offered her a ride.

1104
01:11:08,886 --> 01:11:11,480
Wait a minute. Hey, hey.

1105
01:11:16,561 --> 01:11:20,622
I want you... Shari.

1106
01:11:20,698 --> 01:11:23,724
I don't want anybody else.

1107
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:27,604
Really?

1108
01:11:27,672 --> 01:11:30,436
Yeah.

1109
01:11:30,508 --> 01:11:32,442
It's you I want.

1110
01:11:40,818 --> 01:11:43,343
If you call

1111
01:11:43,421 --> 01:11:46,083
I will answer

1112
01:11:46,157 --> 01:11:48,216
If you call

1113
01:11:52,163 --> 01:11:54,097
If you court

1114
01:11:54,165 --> 01:11:57,623
This disaster

1115
01:12:10,515 --> 01:12:14,144
Dude! Breasts!

1116
01:12:14,218 --> 01:12:16,277
Huh? Where?

1117
01:12:16,354 --> 01:12:19,118
Ed, help!

1118
01:12:19,190 --> 01:12:21,920
Come on, guys.
Don't, don't, don't.

1119
01:12:21,993 --> 01:12:24,329
Come on!

1120
01:12:25,363 --> 01:12:27,297
She left?

1121
01:12:27,365 --> 01:12:32,200
Yeah. She asked for a transfer
to another city, and she left.

1122
01:12:32,270 --> 01:12:35,296
I mean, someone put her breasts
on the Internet.

1123
01:12:35,373 --> 01:12:37,705
- Oh, Christ!
- She couldn't take it anymore.

1124
01:12:37,775 --> 01:12:42,974
We have people living in our hallway,
going through our trash, reporters.

1125
01:12:43,047 --> 01:12:47,381
So, she...
Not even good-bye. Nothin'.

1126
01:12:47,452 --> 01:12:49,784
Boy, you know,

1127
01:12:49,854 --> 01:12:53,881
when it starts to go wrong,
there's nothing you can do to stop it.

1128
01:12:53,958 --> 01:12:58,861
Because I don't think
I could've tried any harder.

1129
01:12:58,930 --> 01:13:01,421
I don't.

1130
01:13:01,499 --> 01:13:03,524
Do you?

1131
01:13:08,906 --> 01:13:10,840
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1132
01:13:10,908 --> 01:13:13,570
Uh-huh. Huh?
You see? You see?

1133
01:13:13,644 --> 01:13:16,238
See that?

1134
01:13:20,752 --> 01:13:22,982
- Oh, honey, hi.
- What are you doin'?

1135
01:13:23,054 --> 01:13:26,023
- I know this might seem unusual.
- How'd you get in my apartment?

1136
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:28,615
I had to be stealthy
about the whole thing.

1137
01:13:28,693 --> 01:13:32,094
- What is she holding?
- Ed's underwear.

1138
01:13:32,163 --> 01:13:34,495
- Get out of my house.
- I can explain everything.

1139
01:13:34,565 --> 01:13:37,398
Just get!
That's my underwear!

1140
01:13:37,468 --> 01:13:41,063
I love you, and I want
to marry you, Ed.

1141
01:13:41,139 --> 01:13:44,905
Watch his face. See?
Now, that's television. Huh?

1142
01:13:44,976 --> 01:13:47,069
All right.

1143
01:13:47,145 --> 01:13:50,376
Now, where do we go from here?
Didn't we order lunch an hour ago?

1144
01:13:50,448 --> 01:13:52,416
- Yes, Chinese.
- Good, good.

1145
01:13:52,483 --> 01:13:55,418
What do we have Ed do next?
Springboards, ideas.

1146
01:13:55,486 --> 01:13:58,284
- Notions! Cynthia?
- We could help him find Shari.

1147
01:13:58,356 --> 01:14:02,087
No, no, no. Enough of her.
I hate her, audiences hate her.

1148
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:05,254
Let's bury her and move on.
Tell him I'll call him back.

1149
01:14:05,329 --> 01:14:09,390
Excuse me. Do you know, the audience is
requesting a lot of that girl Jill...

1150
01:14:09,467 --> 01:14:11,935
that he met on The Tonight Show;
she really scored.

1151
01:14:12,003 --> 01:14:14,767
Let's get her, let's make this happen.
What are we cocking around here for?

1152
01:14:14,839 --> 01:14:16,773
Cynthia, do something.
Get on the phone.

1153
01:14:16,841 --> 01:14:19,435
Is lunch literally coming from China?
I don't understand it.

1154
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:24,743
Remember when you were interviewin' me
and asked me if I had a dream?

1155
01:14:24,816 --> 01:14:28,377
And I said, "Sure, I've got a dream.
I just don't know what it is yet."

1156
01:14:28,453 --> 01:14:32,981
Yeah. Yeah, great line.
Try to work that into the show.

1157
01:14:34,325 --> 01:14:36,987
Wh... What if Shari's the dream?

1158
01:14:37,061 --> 01:14:41,657
Come on, Ed. You're beating yourself up
for nothing. You knew her history.

1159
01:14:41,732 --> 01:14:45,964
When the going gets tough,
Shari gets going...

1160
01:14:46,037 --> 01:14:48,597
as far away as possible.

1161
01:14:48,673 --> 01:14:51,938
She's one of those "I'll dump you
before you dump me" chicks.

1162
01:14:52,009 --> 01:14:55,536
Yeah. But what if we could get U.P.S.
To tell us where they sent her?

1163
01:14:55,613 --> 01:15:00,516
Then I could go visit her, and we could
even move the show there for a while.

1164
01:15:00,585 --> 01:15:03,315
If you want this thing
to work with her,

1165
01:15:03,387 --> 01:15:08,154
the best thing you can do right now
is to give her some space.

1166
01:15:08,226 --> 01:15:11,457
Maybe even, uh, see other people.

1167
01:15:11,529 --> 01:15:14,862
Whoa! What do you mean?
Like right away? No.

1168
01:15:14,932 --> 01:15:18,265
- No, no, l...
- Ed, you're a star.

1169
01:15:18,336 --> 01:15:21,499
But celebrities like you...

1170
01:15:21,572 --> 01:15:24,268
or Tom Cruise or whoever,
you have a responsibility.

1171
01:15:24,342 --> 01:15:29,507
I don't think your fans are gonna be too
thrilled sitting around watching you...

1172
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:31,571
have a major case
of the "mopeys."

1173
01:15:31,649 --> 01:15:33,879
They've got 200 channels
to choose from.

1174
01:15:33,951 --> 01:15:37,717
Ed, it's not like
you're giving up Shari.

1175
01:15:37,788 --> 01:15:40,279
My sister was going
with a guy.

1176
01:15:40,358 --> 01:15:44,385
They hit a little rough spot,
started seeing other people,
they got back together.

1177
01:15:44,462 --> 01:15:49,126
Last month they had their third child,
for what it's worth.

1178
01:15:52,203 --> 01:15:54,535
Twenty-two!
Thirty-two!

1179
01:15:54,605 --> 01:15:58,439
Two, stay with the quarterback.
One, you got the iso on Ed.

1180
01:15:59,911 --> 01:16:04,871
He breaks to the inside. Oh, gosh!
I think he's got a step on him!

1181
01:16:04,949 --> 01:16:07,247
Shecky, have you lost the feed?

1182
01:16:07,318 --> 01:16:11,152
- Ed! Hey, Ed!
- Get up! You lost the feed!

1183
01:16:13,624 --> 01:16:17,151
- Hey, Jill. Ow!
- Ooh!

1184
01:16:17,228 --> 01:16:19,492
What are you doin' to me?
Look alive!

1185
01:16:19,564 --> 01:16:22,362
You guys go ahead.
I'll be back... sometime.

1186
01:16:22,433 --> 01:16:24,765
Ed, where you goin'?
Let's get the game goin'!

1187
01:16:24,835 --> 01:16:27,099
- No, it's not.
- It's a setup.

1188
01:16:27,171 --> 01:16:29,105
I'm gonna ask Cynthia.

1189
01:16:29,173 --> 01:16:31,971
Come on! It's such a setup.

1190
01:16:32,043 --> 01:16:35,604
- Did you arrange this?
- Whose dog is that?

1191
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:38,171
- Out for a walk.
- Walkin' your dog?

1192
01:16:38,249 --> 01:16:40,376
- That's your dog.
- What's your dog's name?

1193
01:16:40,451 --> 01:16:43,614
Um, Ginger.

1194
01:16:43,688 --> 01:16:46,384
- Nielsen looks pretty good on TV, huh?
- Yeah.

1195
01:16:46,457 --> 01:16:48,391
Hey, man!
Way to go, Ed!

1196
01:16:48,459 --> 01:16:51,360
- Picture's worth a thousand bucks.
- Oh, yeah!

1197
01:16:51,429 --> 01:16:54,159
Way to... baboom!

1198
01:16:54,231 --> 01:16:56,893
Ooh, that's delicious.

1199
01:17:04,041 --> 01:17:06,441
Smile, baby!

1200
01:17:08,446 --> 01:17:11,779
- Do you think she likes him?
- She doesn't give a crap about him.

1201
01:17:18,689 --> 01:17:21,123
You want us to kiss? Ed.

1202
01:17:24,462 --> 01:17:27,090
He should be a model or something.

1203
01:17:27,164 --> 01:17:29,098
He's gorgeous.

1204
01:17:38,409 --> 01:17:41,537
Hey, listen, should we, um...

1205
01:17:46,117 --> 01:17:48,677
Ooh.

1206
01:17:48,753 --> 01:17:53,156
Oh, geez, it's, uh...

1207
01:17:53,224 --> 01:17:56,159
Listen, Jill, it's gettin'
kinda late, you know?

1208
01:17:56,227 --> 01:17:58,161
- I mean...
- Is he kidding?

1209
01:17:58,229 --> 01:18:00,561
What are you doing tomorrow night?

1210
01:18:00,631 --> 01:18:03,794
Mm, tomorrow night.
I, um, I got a...

1211
01:18:03,868 --> 01:18:07,565
I got a thing I gotta...
No, that's not tomorrow night.

1212
01:18:09,507 --> 01:18:14,638
Well, listen. Why don't you
come around here, and, um...

1213
01:18:14,712 --> 01:18:18,512
I can make you dinner, and maybe you
could bring a video, and, um...

1214
01:18:18,582 --> 01:18:22,450
Well, you know,
we can make a night of it. Hmm?

1215
01:18:33,064 --> 01:18:33,731
Stay behind the barricade, folks.

1216
01:18:33,731 --> 01:18:35,323
Stay behind the barricade, folks.

1217
01:18:35,399 --> 01:18:37,390
Go, go, go
Go, go, go

1218
01:18:37,468 --> 01:18:39,436
Stay behind the barricade.

1219
01:18:39,503 --> 01:18:41,528
Go, go, go
Go, go, go

1220
01:18:41,605 --> 01:18:45,041
- Go, go, go, go, go, go
- Holy shit!

1221
01:18:54,585 --> 01:18:57,577
I'm startin' to feel
a little pressure.

1222
01:18:57,655 --> 01:18:59,919
- Think he's gonna do it?
- Hell, yeah.

1223
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:04,222
- The guy hasn't had sex in six weeks.
- What, like we have?

1224
01:19:04,295 --> 01:19:06,263
- Here we go. Yeah.
- Smile! Smile!

1225
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:09,493
- Great. Let me try them on.
- Sure, sure, sure.

1226
01:19:17,274 --> 01:19:20,243
We'll park your car for you, Ed.
Save your strength.

1227
01:19:24,148 --> 01:19:27,709
Go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go,

1228
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:45,435
Get out of the way.
Clear the way.

1229
01:19:59,216 --> 01:20:02,151
Ed! Ed! Ed! Ed!

1230
01:20:03,652 --> 01:20:06,382
- Hi.
- Hi.

1231
01:20:09,791 --> 01:20:12,419
Jill! Jill! Jill!

1232
01:20:13,495 --> 01:20:16,487
- Come on in.
- Oh, wow.

1233
01:20:16,565 --> 01:20:19,830
- Look at you!
- Oh, thanks.

1234
01:20:19,902 --> 01:20:21,836
Those boobs are so fake.

1235
01:20:21,904 --> 01:20:24,566
- She's such a slut.
- Total slut.

1236
01:20:33,215 --> 01:20:35,775
Big, big crowd tonight.

1237
01:20:35,851 --> 01:20:38,319
I know.
They've been there for hours.

1238
01:20:44,259 --> 01:20:46,955
- Ed? Do you want to come
and have a little nibble?
- Yeah?

1239
01:20:47,029 --> 01:20:50,021
Wha...

1240
01:20:50,098 --> 01:20:52,089
Oh.

1241
01:20:52,167 --> 01:20:54,658
Yeah. Sure.

1242
01:20:54,736 --> 01:20:56,704
Hey.

1243
01:20:56,772 --> 01:20:59,639
Here, baby.

1244
01:20:59,708 --> 01:21:02,336
- Thought you had a dog.
- Huh?

1245
01:21:02,411 --> 01:21:05,437
Oh, no, that was a friend's.
I've just got lovely Isabella.

1246
01:21:05,514 --> 01:21:09,678
Hey, baby. Yes, good girl.
Down you go.

1247
01:21:09,751 --> 01:21:11,878
Good girl.

1248
01:21:11,954 --> 01:21:14,320
A deeper shade of red

1249
01:21:14,389 --> 01:21:16,721
On your lips

1250
01:21:16,792 --> 01:21:20,193
Tryin' to find a way to be loved

1251
01:21:20,262 --> 01:21:25,598
Without ever givin' in

1252
01:21:30,105 --> 01:21:32,665
- Wow!
- Oh-ho!

1253
01:21:38,046 --> 01:21:41,038
- Good?
- Mmm.

1254
01:21:41,116 --> 01:21:43,050
Mm-hmm.

1255
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:48,619
Careful what you wish for

1256
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:51,352
It just might come true

1257
01:21:51,426 --> 01:21:54,361
Might come true

1258
01:21:54,429 --> 01:21:56,693
Uh, Mr. President?

1259
01:22:00,269 --> 01:22:04,797
- Isn't this what you always wanted
- I love her!

1260
01:22:04,873 --> 01:22:07,535
- Get out of the way!
- I love her! I love her!

1261
01:23:04,533 --> 01:23:06,933
Wow!

1262
01:23:11,506 --> 01:23:15,237
Hot damn!
We are go for sex, people.

1263
01:23:29,057 --> 01:23:32,754
I love this show, bro.

1264
01:23:32,828 --> 01:23:36,320
- Is this okay, Cynthia?
- Don't leave yet.
This is cable. Stay with him.

1265
01:23:36,431 --> 01:23:39,594
Cynthia, Cynthia!
Will you get over there!

1266
01:23:49,711 --> 01:23:51,770
Oh, my.

1267
01:24:05,861 --> 01:24:07,795
Ahh!

1268
01:24:07,863 --> 01:24:09,660
Oh! What's he doing?

1269
01:24:11,266 --> 01:24:14,030
Ed, you okay?

1270
01:24:14,102 --> 01:24:17,003
Ohh, something broke my fall.

1271
01:24:17,072 --> 01:24:19,540
Ooh!

1272
01:24:19,608 --> 01:24:22,543
Ooh!

1273
01:24:24,946 --> 01:24:27,437
Please, let me through.

1274
01:24:27,516 --> 01:24:30,314
Is it bad?
Is it bad?

1275
01:24:30,385 --> 01:24:32,376
I think she just broke her leg.

1276
01:24:34,723 --> 01:24:38,124
- Excuse me.
- My back's a little sore.
I didn't break it.

1277
01:24:38,193 --> 01:24:41,185
- I can walk.
- We're just taking you in for an X ray.

1278
01:24:41,263 --> 01:24:45,393
The thing got the highest ratings.
Higher than the Super Bowl.

1279
01:24:45,467 --> 01:24:50,769
It's kind of the same thing.
A big buildup, and then one team
just can't perform.

1280
01:24:50,839 --> 01:24:54,741
All that boy did was hurt
that little girl's pussy.

1281
01:24:54,810 --> 01:24:59,076
- Ooh!
- I'm talkin' about her cat.

1282
01:24:59,147 --> 01:25:04,608
If that had been a start, if he had
given a terrific performance that night,

1283
01:25:04,686 --> 01:25:07,484
the American people
would have loved him, but he failed us.

1284
01:25:07,556 --> 01:25:10,548
- No, I don't agree.
- He failed us as a man.

1285
01:25:10,625 --> 01:25:13,890
Look at this.

1286
01:25:13,962 --> 01:25:18,797
She did not...
She did not break my heart.

1287
01:25:18,867 --> 01:25:23,270
Look, I understand that I'm
fair game, but just tell it like it is.

1288
01:25:23,338 --> 01:25:27,104
She was a hot-lookin' chick.
I get that. I knew the score.

1289
01:25:27,175 --> 01:25:30,338
"Broke my heart."
No, you know what Jill did?

1290
01:25:30,412 --> 01:25:34,280
Jill went out to L.A. And got one of
those scandal agents that handle...

1291
01:25:34,349 --> 01:25:39,810
like Joey Buttafuoco,
Kato Kaelin and Gennifer Flowers...

1292
01:25:49,331 --> 01:25:52,732
Oh, my God, he wrote a book.

1293
01:25:58,607 --> 01:26:01,508
I mean, he never even
read a book, man.

1294
01:26:01,576 --> 01:26:06,445
What's your feeling about the meaning,
if any, of Ed TV?

1295
01:26:06,515 --> 01:26:10,474
Well, Harry, I-I feel that
Ed is the apotheosis...

1296
01:26:10,552 --> 01:26:12,816
of a prevailing
American syndrome.

1297
01:26:12,888 --> 01:26:15,880
It used to be that people
were famous for being special.

1298
01:26:15,957 --> 01:26:19,290
Now they're considered special,
uh, merely for being famous.

1299
01:26:19,361 --> 01:26:22,353
Fame has become a moral good...

1300
01:26:22,430 --> 01:26:25,524
in this country:
It's its own virtue.

1301
01:26:31,172 --> 01:26:35,973
We thought since we had
Ray Pekurny on the panel today,
we'd talk about his book.

1302
01:26:36,044 --> 01:26:39,104
It is called
"My Brother Pissed On Me."

1303
01:26:41,216 --> 01:26:44,845
Is that a metaphorical title, or did
your brother actually piss on you?

1304
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:47,684
I put... I put everything in the book.

1305
01:26:47,756 --> 01:26:51,123
Everything.
All this is in the book.

1306
01:26:51,192 --> 01:26:55,288
I'll be honest, I have not read
the book because it looks stupid.

1307
01:26:57,933 --> 01:27:00,663
What?

1308
01:27:00,735 --> 01:27:05,365
I'm just saying maybe we
should start thinking about when
we want to take him off the air.

1309
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:08,637
Why? What are you talking
about, take him off the air?
He just got out of the hospital.

1310
01:27:08,710 --> 01:27:10,644
He's fine. The cat's fine.

1311
01:27:10,712 --> 01:27:13,272
- The ratings are higher than ever.
- Well, you know,

1312
01:27:13,348 --> 01:27:15,680
it's like when you're chewing
gum and blowing a bubble.

1313
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:17,308
- Good, a metaphor.
- Right.

1314
01:27:17,385 --> 01:27:21,116
And the bubble keeps getting bigger
and bigger and you've got to decide.

1315
01:27:21,189 --> 01:27:26,388
When do you suck it in?
Or if you don't, it explodes
and then you've got gum face.

1316
01:27:27,862 --> 01:27:31,354
Cynthia, I started out
as an associate producer...

1317
01:27:31,433 --> 01:27:33,697
on Good Morning Fresno.

1318
01:27:33,768 --> 01:27:38,535
And I didn't get from there to here by
worrying about getting gum in my face.

1319
01:27:40,675 --> 01:27:43,109
All I'm saying is,
I think we've peaked.

1320
01:27:43,178 --> 01:27:47,012
And all I'm saying is, you don't know
your ass from a toboggan.

1321
01:27:47,082 --> 01:27:49,846
We're gonna stay with
the boy for another month.

1322
01:27:49,918 --> 01:27:52,113
- You know how I know I'm right?
- Mm.

1323
01:27:52,187 --> 01:27:56,790
Because I'm driving the big car,
and you're driving the little car.

1324
01:28:03,763 --> 01:28:07,392
Look, Ed, you put anybody
on television 16 hours a day,

1325
01:28:07,467 --> 01:28:11,335
at some point they're going to wind up
rolling off a table and squashing a cat.

1326
01:28:11,404 --> 01:28:14,373
- Oh, man, that's not my point.
- All right, look.

1327
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:17,932
With no privacy, there is no dignity.
Capisce?

1328
01:28:18,011 --> 01:28:20,878
Oh, yeah, nice.

1329
01:28:20,947 --> 01:28:26,408
- Hello. Hello, Mom?
- Eddie, it's Mom.

1330
01:28:26,486 --> 01:28:29,216
Eddie, I'm in the hospital.

1331
01:28:29,289 --> 01:28:31,587
Mom, Mom, what happened?

1332
01:28:31,658 --> 01:28:34,320
Eddie, it's Dad.

1333
01:28:34,394 --> 01:28:36,919
He's dead.
He had a heart attack.

1334
01:28:41,134 --> 01:28:45,070
Did I tell ya he was gonna die?
Did I say? Huh? Come on.

1335
01:28:49,275 --> 01:28:53,268
Excuse me. I'm looking for my mother.
My name's Ed Pekurny.

1336
01:28:53,346 --> 01:28:57,282
- Mr. Pekurny, I'm Dr. Geller.
- Hi.

1337
01:28:57,350 --> 01:29:01,081
Your mother's lying down for a minute.
We gave her something to calm her down.

1338
01:29:01,154 --> 01:29:03,281
Thank you.
Can I see her?

1339
01:29:03,356 --> 01:29:06,223
Uh, why don't you just give her
a minute? She'll be right out.

1340
01:29:06,292 --> 01:29:09,420
Why don't you sit over here
for a second?

1341
01:29:09,495 --> 01:29:13,454
What happened to him?
Did he...

1342
01:29:13,533 --> 01:29:15,967
Did he suffer any,
or was it quick?

1343
01:29:16,035 --> 01:29:18,003
Yeah, it was very quick.

1344
01:29:18,071 --> 01:29:20,596
Between you and me,
it's not a bad way to go.

1345
01:29:20,673 --> 01:29:24,006
- How's that?
- Making love to your wife.

1346
01:29:24,077 --> 01:29:26,671
It's very sweet.

1347
01:29:26,746 --> 01:29:30,682
- They were making love
when he had a heart attack?
- According to your mother.

1348
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:34,379
Eddie, thank God you're here.

1349
01:29:34,454 --> 01:29:36,820
- How's your mother?
- Al!

1350
01:29:36,890 --> 01:29:40,451
- What's going on? Thought he was dead.
- How'd you get here?

1351
01:29:40,526 --> 01:29:43,222
The neighbors drove me over.
The worst goddamn driver...

1352
01:29:43,296 --> 01:29:45,230
What are you doing here?

1353
01:29:45,298 --> 01:29:48,062
- Where's Jeanette?
- I thought you said he was dead?

1354
01:29:48,134 --> 01:29:50,068
- Who?
- Al!

1355
01:29:50,136 --> 01:29:53,663
No, no.
The deceased is Henry Pekurny.

1356
01:29:55,408 --> 01:29:57,569
Good twist.

1357
01:29:57,644 --> 01:29:59,771
- This is beautiful. I love this!
- What?

1358
01:29:59,846 --> 01:30:03,009
Don't you get it? The mother was
shtupping the ex-husband.

1359
01:30:04,984 --> 01:30:07,214
You thought it was me?

1360
01:30:07,287 --> 01:30:09,221
Yeah, Al.

1361
01:30:09,289 --> 01:30:11,519
It was your father, Hank.

1362
01:30:11,591 --> 01:30:17,257
Your mother went to see him, and he
suddenly dropped dead of a heart attack.

1363
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:20,128
Dr. Geller, Dr. Stack
wants to see you.

1364
01:30:20,199 --> 01:30:23,191
Oh, excuse me.

1365
01:30:26,739 --> 01:30:30,038
Could I have your autograph?
It's for my niece.

1366
01:30:32,812 --> 01:30:35,576
Al. How did you, uh...

1367
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:37,582
The Burkharts drove me over.

1368
01:30:39,819 --> 01:30:43,880
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine, l...

1369
01:30:43,957 --> 01:30:46,482
Good. I gotta pee.

1370
01:30:46,559 --> 01:30:49,255
Wish me luck.

1371
01:30:49,329 --> 01:30:53,766
Hey. Hey, uh... Oh...

1372
01:30:53,833 --> 01:30:56,131
Mom.

1373
01:31:02,475 --> 01:31:05,774
Geez. What happened, Mom?

1374
01:31:05,845 --> 01:31:07,779
Eddie, it was horrible.

1375
01:31:07,847 --> 01:31:09,781
- He called me up.
- Who?

1376
01:31:09,849 --> 01:31:15,253
Hank. He said he wanted to talk to me.
He wanted to apologize for everything.

1377
01:31:15,321 --> 01:31:18,984
I went over to this horrible place
where he was staying, and l...

1378
01:31:19,058 --> 01:31:21,253
I just felt so sorry for him.

1379
01:31:21,327 --> 01:31:25,821
- So you had sex with him?
- What?

1380
01:31:25,898 --> 01:31:29,834
The doctor told me you were
having sex. He told me.

1381
01:31:29,902 --> 01:31:32,166
- To you in front of them?
- Yeah, Mom.

1382
01:31:32,238 --> 01:31:35,833
He assumed Hank was your husband.
You know, common sense.

1383
01:31:35,908 --> 01:31:39,105
- My God! On TV!
- Mom, why? How?

1384
01:31:39,178 --> 01:31:42,147
One thing led to another.

1385
01:31:42,215 --> 01:31:44,911
- He was my husband once.
- But Al is your husband now.

1386
01:31:44,984 --> 01:31:47,578
You think it's been easy
for me all these years?

1387
01:31:47,653 --> 01:31:49,587
Al can't have sex!

1388
01:31:49,655 --> 01:31:53,819
Apparently neither can Hank, Mom.

1389
01:31:53,893 --> 01:31:57,727
Let's recap this whole thing.
The mother's too good at it, right?

1390
01:31:57,797 --> 01:31:59,890
Both brothers stink at it.

1391
01:31:59,966 --> 01:32:03,424
The stepfather can't do it at all. And
the father did it, but it killed him.

1392
01:32:03,503 --> 01:32:05,994
How the hell did
this family reproduce?

1393
01:32:06,072 --> 01:32:09,303
How did they even get here?

1394
01:32:09,375 --> 01:32:13,004
This is worse than all the daily
tabloid television that exists.

1395
01:32:13,079 --> 01:32:15,877
Isn't the appeal of this show now...

1396
01:32:15,948 --> 01:32:18,382
that everybody's
got a skeleton in their closet?

1397
01:32:18,451 --> 01:32:20,385
But how many skeletons
can one family have?

1398
01:32:20,453 --> 01:32:22,785
No, I think our country's saying
we've had enough of this.

1399
01:32:22,855 --> 01:32:26,313
Let's get back to the way
TV used to be.

1400
01:32:48,414 --> 01:32:50,348
We are gathered today...

1401
01:33:00,293 --> 01:33:02,227
How ya doin', boy?

1402
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:09,401
- How was the service?
- It was all right.

1403
01:33:09,469 --> 01:33:12,836
His parole officer said
some lovely words,

1404
01:33:12,905 --> 01:33:15,874
and once again I was reminded
the end is near.

1405
01:33:15,942 --> 01:33:19,105
Sorry you couldn't
come in, kiddo,

1406
01:33:19,178 --> 01:33:24,707
but for some reason, the family feels
they're not comin' off so well on TV.

1407
01:33:27,253 --> 01:33:32,122
Well... you and Mom are gonna
work things out, aren't ya?

1408
01:33:32,191 --> 01:33:35,285
I'm movin' out.

1409
01:33:35,361 --> 01:33:38,797
- No, Al. What do you mean,
you're moving out?
- I'm gonna live with my brother.

1410
01:33:38,865 --> 01:33:43,734
He's not in such good shape as me,
but I'm looking forward
to the pillow fights.

1411
01:33:44,804 --> 01:33:47,705
Hank.

1412
01:33:47,773 --> 01:33:50,207
Hank was always good
with the ladies.

1413
01:33:50,276 --> 01:33:52,403
Always good-lookin'.

1414
01:33:52,478 --> 01:33:55,970
Hell, he's been dead for two days,
he still looks better than me.

1415
01:33:56,048 --> 01:34:01,076
I wanna tell you something, Al.

1416
01:34:01,154 --> 01:34:03,884
You know, Hank, he...

1417
01:34:09,996 --> 01:34:13,124
You're my father, Al.

1418
01:34:39,058 --> 01:34:41,891
Take care of yourself, huh?

1419
01:34:41,961 --> 01:34:44,327
You know I will.

1420
01:34:52,872 --> 01:34:57,935
I guess it's when...
you know the head, it's, uh,

1421
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:59,944
different.

1422
01:35:03,182 --> 01:35:06,618
You have done it!
I've had it!

1423
01:35:06,686 --> 01:35:09,052
Hey, Crockett.
Ease up, man.

1424
01:35:09,121 --> 01:35:12,113
Ease up? He just devoured
my entire Buddy Holly collection!

1425
01:35:12,191 --> 01:35:14,250
What is it with you?

1426
01:35:14,327 --> 01:35:17,888
How would you like it if somebody
chewed up your personal belongings?

1427
01:35:17,964 --> 01:35:20,899
See this blanket?
You see this?

1428
01:35:20,967 --> 01:35:23,527
Elvis loves this blanket. It's
his most favorite thing in the whole...

1429
01:35:28,941 --> 01:35:31,967
- Three more months?
- Yeah, absolutely.

1430
01:35:32,044 --> 01:35:36,242
Ed TV's more popular than ever. The
resurgence in interest is astounding.

1431
01:35:36,315 --> 01:35:39,182
Of course, this means
another big bonus payment for you.

1432
01:35:39,252 --> 01:35:41,652
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1433
01:35:41,721 --> 01:35:45,919
Ed, have you thought about
moving in with your mother?

1434
01:35:45,992 --> 01:35:50,520
I mean, she's all alone now.
I'm sure she could use your support.

1435
01:35:57,470 --> 01:36:01,741
We're not as dumb
as you people think we are.

1436
01:36:09,949 --> 01:36:14,648
I'm takin' what little dignity
there is left,

1437
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:16,950
and I quit.

1438
01:36:19,024 --> 01:36:22,516
Yeah. Can somebody
validate my parking?

1439
01:36:22,595 --> 01:36:25,189
I'm afraid that
that's not possible.

1440
01:36:25,264 --> 01:36:27,858
- Okay, Mr. Big Network.
I'll pay for it myself.
- No.

1441
01:36:27,933 --> 01:36:29,958
I mean, you can't quit.

1442
01:36:30,035 --> 01:36:33,732
The hell I can't.
Look, I just did.

1443
01:36:33,806 --> 01:36:36,969
I know, Ed. But, you see,

1444
01:36:37,042 --> 01:36:40,205
you agreed to stay on the air
as long as we asked you to.

1445
01:36:40,279 --> 01:36:43,373
The station entered into this
with that understanding.

1446
01:36:43,449 --> 01:36:47,180
Now, if you had refused
up front,

1447
01:36:47,253 --> 01:36:50,051
well, we would have done this
with somebody else.

1448
01:36:50,122 --> 01:36:54,422
You can't just change the rules
in the middle of the game, son.

1449
01:36:54,493 --> 01:36:56,427
It's just not fair.

1450
01:36:56,495 --> 01:36:59,658
Listen, if you don't
let me out of this now,

1451
01:36:59,732 --> 01:37:03,429
I-I-I'm gonna go home,
stick my thumb up my butt,

1452
01:37:03,502 --> 01:37:05,834
sit on my ass
and not do a damn thing.

1453
01:37:05,905 --> 01:37:08,373
I won't go anywhere.

1454
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:11,466
- What kind of show
does that sound like?
- Uh, not too good.

1455
01:37:11,544 --> 01:37:16,413
- No, not too good.
- That's why it states very
specifically in your contract...

1456
01:37:16,482 --> 01:37:20,179
that if you don't continue
to live a normal life,

1457
01:37:20,252 --> 01:37:24,279
well, then,
you're in breach, see?

1458
01:37:24,356 --> 01:37:30,261
And you're liable for all the station's
financial losses.

1459
01:38:02,294 --> 01:38:04,353
I'll get this.

1460
01:38:18,143 --> 01:38:20,077
Autograph, please?

1461
01:38:55,414 --> 01:38:57,712
Ed, come on out!

1462
01:39:06,458 --> 01:39:08,392
Shari.

1463
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:11,190
Oh, my God.
Move! Excuse me!

1464
01:39:11,263 --> 01:39:11,931
Whoa, whoa!
Shari! Shari!

1465
01:39:11,931 --> 01:39:15,298
Whoa, whoa!
Shari! Shari!

1466
01:39:16,702 --> 01:39:19,034
Watch it. Watch it!

1467
01:39:19,104 --> 01:39:21,732
Who's got the shot?
Who's got the shot?

1468
01:39:21,807 --> 01:39:24,469
Just give it to me.
Come on, come on.

1469
01:39:24,543 --> 01:39:27,034
- Come on, he's on the move!
- Go, go, go!

1470
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:36,654
We got him! We got him!

1471
01:39:36,722 --> 01:39:38,622
Fire it up.
We're rolling.

1472
01:39:47,399 --> 01:39:49,731
Keep the microwave high, Shecky.

1473
01:39:55,007 --> 01:39:57,237
- Ahh!
- Come on, Carlos!

1474
01:39:57,309 --> 01:40:01,245
- Get up! Get up!
- Come on, he's getting away.

1475
01:40:19,098 --> 01:40:21,032
Hi. One, please.

1476
01:40:27,506 --> 01:40:29,599
Excuse me.

1477
01:40:29,675 --> 01:40:31,939
Hey! Give me one.

1478
01:40:33,178 --> 01:40:36,045
- I'm looking for a girl, tall...
- Bad wig?

1479
01:40:36,115 --> 01:40:39,050
- Yeah.
- Theater three. Your ticket.

1480
01:40:44,523 --> 01:40:47,458
- Ohh!
- Watch it! Watch it!

1481
01:40:49,561 --> 01:40:52,189
Ohh!

1482
01:40:52,264 --> 01:40:54,789
Shari, are you okay?
I'm sorry. Let me see.

1483
01:40:54,867 --> 01:40:56,698
You okay?

1484
01:40:56,769 --> 01:40:58,828
Shari!

1485
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:10,605
Shari?

1486
01:41:11,984 --> 01:41:14,680
- Shari. It sounds like you.
- It's not me.

1487
01:41:15,054 --> 01:41:18,046
- Well, it's not. Now, go away.
- I thought you moved.

1488
01:41:18,123 --> 01:41:21,024
I just came
for my brother's birthday.

1489
01:41:21,093 --> 01:41:25,393
- In a disguise?
- I wanted to see you, but I
didn't want you to see me.

1490
01:41:25,464 --> 01:41:29,560
Listen to me.
I know why you left.

1491
01:41:29,635 --> 01:41:31,762
Everyone knows why, Ed.
I told you why.

1492
01:41:31,837 --> 01:41:36,001
No, you said it was because
of the TV, but I don't believe that.

1493
01:41:36,075 --> 01:41:41,945
Look at us. We've been with people
before, and it didn't work out.

1494
01:41:42,014 --> 01:41:45,177
And none of it
was on TV, Shari.

1495
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:47,184
None of it.

1496
01:41:49,088 --> 01:41:52,114
You and me,

1497
01:41:52,191 --> 01:41:54,318
we've been burned.

1498
01:41:54,393 --> 01:41:57,362
And we're scared.

1499
01:41:59,231 --> 01:42:02,132
That's why you left.

1500
01:42:02,201 --> 01:42:05,637
And that's why...

1501
01:42:07,139 --> 01:42:10,802
I didn't do a damn thing
to stop ya.

1502
01:42:16,448 --> 01:42:18,382
Shari?

1503
01:42:27,159 --> 01:42:29,127
All right.

1504
01:43:02,995 --> 01:43:06,021
- Ooh! Ooh!
- I'm sorry.

1505
01:43:29,388 --> 01:43:31,447
- Oh, wow.
- Mm.

1506
01:43:33,358 --> 01:43:36,452
All right, listen.
You stay here.

1507
01:43:36,528 --> 01:43:38,792
I'm leaving.
These guys are coming with me.

1508
01:43:38,864 --> 01:43:41,765
I don't know what I'm gonna do,
but I'm gonna figure something out
so we can be together.

1509
01:43:41,833 --> 01:43:44,233
- Okay?
- Okay.

1510
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:57,049
Let's go, guys.

1511
01:43:57,182 --> 01:43:59,548
No, Mike. Follow Shari.

1512
01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:03,053
Mike, Shecky, come on.

1513
01:44:04,723 --> 01:44:08,887
Mike, Shecky, I'm leaving.
You're supposed to follow me. Let's go.

1514
01:44:19,738 --> 01:44:22,730
Give him room, people.
Give him room.

1515
01:44:24,443 --> 01:44:28,072
- Hi, Ed.
- Why the hell are they
still followin' Shari?

1516
01:44:28,146 --> 01:44:30,774
It's their new concept.
Since...

1517
01:44:30,849 --> 01:44:33,340
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1518
01:44:33,418 --> 01:44:36,353
What's going on?
Why is my family on TV?

1519
01:44:36,421 --> 01:44:39,015
Like I was saying,
it's a new concept.

1520
01:44:39,091 --> 01:44:41,958
Since Shari and your family
all signed releases,

1521
01:44:42,027 --> 01:44:44,757
we're allowed to follow them on camera
even though you're not with them.

1522
01:44:44,830 --> 01:44:49,699
So we go with whoever's the most
exciting. And right now, look.

1523
01:44:49,768 --> 01:44:54,398
See, it's you and...
Oh, me.

1524
01:44:54,473 --> 01:44:57,271
- You can't do this.
- I'm not a lawyer.

1525
01:44:57,342 --> 01:44:59,810
I'm just a guy who eats
three meals a day in this truck.

1526
01:44:59,878 --> 01:45:02,506
We gotta get them off the air.
This is not part of the deal.

1527
01:45:02,581 --> 01:45:05,846
I don't give a goddamn.
Make the call, man.

1528
01:45:05,917 --> 01:45:11,321
- Make the call. Get 'em off.
- Look, Ed, this is...

1529
01:45:14,126 --> 01:45:17,926
- Ed! Ed, come on!
- Ed, if you break the truck...

1530
01:45:17,996 --> 01:45:22,399
If you break the truck, they'll
charge you for it. They'll have
a new one here in 15 minutes.

1531
01:45:22,467 --> 01:45:25,334
Ten.

1532
01:45:25,403 --> 01:45:28,167
Come on, Ed.
This is crazy.

1533
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:32,574
Hey, hey.
They got ya, man.

1534
01:45:32,644 --> 01:45:34,908
Just... go home.

1535
01:45:34,980 --> 01:45:37,448
Go home, Gomer!

1536
01:45:39,084 --> 01:45:41,348
Ed, this is crazy.
Come on.

1537
01:45:52,430 --> 01:45:54,364
You know what?

1538
01:45:59,404 --> 01:46:01,338
They're right.

1539
01:46:03,208 --> 01:46:05,142
This is a great idea.

1540
01:46:05,210 --> 01:46:07,974
My family is interesting.

1541
01:46:08,046 --> 01:46:09,980
Hell, look at 'em.

1542
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:15,186
But everybody's interesting, right?

1543
01:46:15,253 --> 01:46:20,247
I bet you that wacky little group
that owns this network...

1544
01:46:20,325 --> 01:46:22,259
that I had the meeting with,

1545
01:46:22,327 --> 01:46:25,558
I bet they're pretty goddamn interesting
too, don't you think?

1546
01:46:25,630 --> 01:46:29,327
Huh? I'll bet they are.

1547
01:46:29,401 --> 01:46:34,236
Yeah. I'll bet you
$10,000 they are.

1548
01:46:36,107 --> 01:46:41,511
Yeah. I oughta loosen up
a little bit, shouldn't I?

1549
01:46:41,580 --> 01:46:44,743
Let's have a little fun
with this thing.

1550
01:46:44,816 --> 01:46:49,810
Let's really blow it out. Let's, let's
have... Let's have a contest.

1551
01:46:49,888 --> 01:46:52,322
Who can dig up...

1552
01:46:52,390 --> 01:46:55,416
the most embarrassing and humiliating
information on any of the executives...

1553
01:46:55,493 --> 01:46:59,930
of the Northwest Broadcast Company,
which owns this station, True TV.

1554
01:46:59,998 --> 01:47:02,660
After all, why should anyone...

1555
01:47:02,734 --> 01:47:04,725
have any privacy, right?

1556
01:47:04,803 --> 01:47:07,101
So I want anything...

1557
01:47:07,172 --> 01:47:10,039
from their past, their present,
business, personal, you name it.

1558
01:47:10,108 --> 01:47:12,042
If it's dirty and true,
we want it.

1559
01:47:12,110 --> 01:47:15,079
Whoever brings the sleaziest
and most degrading...

1560
01:47:15,146 --> 01:47:19,048
material to me,
I'm gonna pay you...

1561
01:47:19,117 --> 01:47:21,711
$10,000.

1562
01:47:21,786 --> 01:47:24,414
Yeah, Eddie!
I love this guy!

1563
01:47:24,489 --> 01:47:26,889
And tonight at 9:00,
I'll announce...

1564
01:47:26,958 --> 01:47:29,051
the big winner, all right?

1565
01:47:29,127 --> 01:47:31,960
Now, you're gonna need
my home number.

1566
01:47:32,030 --> 01:47:34,521
Call me anytime.

1567
01:47:34,599 --> 01:47:37,466
And if you get in right now,
I'm gonna throw in a bonus.

1568
01:47:37,535 --> 01:47:40,003
You're gonna get a free book
by author Ray Pekurny...

1569
01:47:40,071 --> 01:47:43,234
titled "My Brother
Pissed on Me."

1570
01:47:43,308 --> 01:47:45,970
All right, America.
Come on, baby. Let's start diggin'.

1571
01:47:46,044 --> 01:47:49,377
- This is ridiculous.
- How can this be legal?

1572
01:47:49,447 --> 01:47:52,439
- It's defamation. It's slander.
- Not technically,

1573
01:47:52,517 --> 01:47:55,452
because he is not showing
reckless disregard for the truth.

1574
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,750
- Oh, come on!
- What are you saying?

1575
01:47:57,822 --> 01:48:00,848
- At 9:00 he can say
whatever he wants about us?
- That is ridiculous.

1576
01:48:00,925 --> 01:48:03,553
There has got to be some way
we can shut this hillbilly up.

1577
01:48:03,628 --> 01:48:06,290
- Hey, I've got a idea.
- What?

1578
01:48:06,364 --> 01:48:08,491
Let's not shut him up.

1579
01:48:08,566 --> 01:48:11,592
Let's get him to push it to Sunday
when the audience is bigger,

1580
01:48:11,670 --> 01:48:15,606
promote it for the next
five days, really hype it
because it's a rating's grabber,

1581
01:48:15,674 --> 01:48:18,336
which is all that counts,
so run with it.

1582
01:48:18,410 --> 01:48:21,004
You were right, I was wrong.

1583
01:48:21,079 --> 01:48:23,639
See, Ed TV is going
to be bigger than ever.

1584
01:48:23,715 --> 01:48:26,912
Cynthia, another word
and you may consider yourself fired.

1585
01:48:26,985 --> 01:48:29,681
Uh-oh.
Can you give me a hint?

1586
01:48:29,754 --> 01:48:32,245
What word?
Um, "asshole"?

1587
01:48:33,858 --> 01:48:37,521
"Shithead"? I bet that...
Is that one word or two?

1588
01:48:37,595 --> 01:48:40,189
I never can remember that.

1589
01:48:40,265 --> 01:48:42,199
"Shithead." Anyway, listen.

1590
01:48:42,267 --> 01:48:46,795
It has been a real pleasure
workin' for ya. I have loved it.

1591
01:48:46,871 --> 01:48:49,806
Loved it, loved it,
loved it, loved it, loved it.

1592
01:48:49,874 --> 01:48:51,364
Loved it!

1593
01:48:51,443 --> 01:48:55,709
He didn't tip people?
Maybe you're not hot.

1594
01:48:55,780 --> 01:48:58,010
Yeah. Uh...

1595
01:48:58,083 --> 01:49:00,813
I gotta go.
My brother's here.

1596
01:49:09,961 --> 01:49:14,989
Look, we gotta settle this.

1597
01:49:18,403 --> 01:49:21,736
Well, all right, man.

1598
01:49:23,942 --> 01:49:28,879
- They're gonna fight.
- Maybe they'll kill each other.
That's at least an ending.

1599
01:49:38,289 --> 01:49:40,689
Okay, settled.

1600
01:49:40,759 --> 01:49:42,886
Yeah, great.

1601
01:49:42,961 --> 01:49:45,930
- Oh, that's it?
- What was that?

1602
01:49:45,997 --> 01:49:50,764
Some kind of brotherly...
Southern brotherly thing.

1603
01:49:50,835 --> 01:49:53,770
Here you go. You weren't gonna swing,
were ya? Were you ready to swing?

1604
01:49:53,838 --> 01:49:55,772
I was ready to throw there.

1605
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:58,673
You know, good thing I was here.

1606
01:49:58,743 --> 01:50:01,007
You got all kinds of calls.

1607
01:50:05,083 --> 01:50:08,348
This is not good.
This is not a good thing.

1608
01:50:08,420 --> 01:50:11,082
Would 40 of these kill me?

1609
01:50:13,992 --> 01:50:17,257
What if we compromised?
Asked him to stay on two more weeks,

1610
01:50:17,328 --> 01:50:20,229
and then kick him off.

1611
01:50:20,298 --> 01:50:22,391
Ah, phone.

1612
01:50:22,467 --> 01:50:26,267
Here we go. Hello.

1613
01:50:26,337 --> 01:50:28,862
- Is this Ed?
- Yes, it is. Who's this?

1614
01:50:28,940 --> 01:50:32,273
I've got some information for you.
Better than anything you've got.

1615
01:50:32,343 --> 01:50:33,901
Okay, I'm here.

1616
01:50:33,978 --> 01:50:38,574
I got this from one of the secretaries
that works at the network.

1617
01:50:38,650 --> 01:50:41,448
Got a little blitzed
at the Christmas party.

1618
01:50:41,519 --> 01:50:45,353
Listen carefully.
I'm only gonna say this once...

1619
01:50:45,423 --> 01:50:48,483
'cause talking this way
is really hurting my throat.

1620
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:51,825
Can anyone see
what he's writing?

1621
01:50:51,896 --> 01:50:57,334
"Duck"? Did anybody do anything
with a duck?

1622
01:50:57,402 --> 01:51:00,929
Jesus! I'd hate to be stuck
in a foxhole with this group.

1623
01:51:01,005 --> 01:51:04,441
- There's not a full-grown
pair of testicles among you.
- Uh, sir, l...

1624
01:51:04,509 --> 01:51:08,138
Whatever little embarrassments
he comes up with, we'll spin it.

1625
01:51:08,213 --> 01:51:12,240
This guy is gonna stay on TV
until he dies.

1626
01:51:12,317 --> 01:51:15,081
Relax!

1627
01:51:17,388 --> 01:51:21,586
Okay. Yes, I got it.
Thank you

1628
01:51:23,595 --> 01:51:26,792
- Well?
- I think we've got a winner.

1629
01:51:26,865 --> 01:51:28,833
- Uh, Rayford?
- Ho!

1630
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:31,630
- Well, 9:00 yet?
- 9:01.

1631
01:51:31,703 --> 01:51:34,536
9:01. Got it. Okay.

1632
01:51:34,606 --> 01:51:38,098
I don't know how many of you out there
are paying attention right now,

1633
01:51:38,176 --> 01:51:41,304
but for those of you who are,
I think we just got the winner.

1634
01:51:41,379 --> 01:51:44,715
Whoo!

1635
01:51:48,285 --> 01:51:50,753
How many of you know...

1636
01:51:50,821 --> 01:51:53,585
what a penile implant is?

1637
01:52:01,031 --> 01:52:04,728
As it's explained to me, what happens
is you got two cylinders: One, two.

1638
01:52:04,801 --> 01:52:08,760
And they are inserted
into the shaft.

1639
01:52:08,839 --> 01:52:11,034
Oh!

1640
01:52:11,108 --> 01:52:14,600
Now, to get an erection,
what this man does is...

1641
01:52:14,678 --> 01:52:17,977
he squeezes his pump,
and it forces a fluid...

1642
01:52:18,048 --> 01:52:20,710
that goes in the cylinders
into the shaft.

1643
01:52:23,386 --> 01:52:25,411
Voila, you've got your stiffie.

1644
01:52:26,790 --> 01:52:30,317
You're good to go.
So, who's this lucky guy?

1645
01:52:30,393 --> 01:52:34,386
I mean, who is this true
TV executive who can now get
his Johnson to head north...

1646
01:52:34,464 --> 01:52:36,227
anytime he wants?

1647
01:52:36,299 --> 01:52:38,324
I'm gonna tell you
who the lucky man is right now.

1648
01:52:38,401 --> 01:52:40,266
- Tell us, brother!
- All right.

1649
01:52:41,338 --> 01:52:43,135
Here we go.

1650
01:52:43,206 --> 01:52:45,436
The man of the hour is Mr...

1651
01:52:47,310 --> 01:52:49,676
Whoo!

1652
01:52:49,746 --> 01:52:50,814
True TV regrets to inform
our audience that...

1653
01:52:50,814 --> 01:52:52,805
True TV regrets to inform
our audience that...

1654
01:52:52,883 --> 01:52:57,445
due to circumstances beyond our control,
Ed TV will no longer be presented.

1655
01:52:57,521 --> 01:52:59,682
Whoo!

1656
01:53:02,159 --> 01:53:04,525
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1657
01:53:04,594 --> 01:53:08,826
- Who's the guy with the phony...
- What do they expect us to do now?

1658
01:53:13,303 --> 01:53:16,534
Look, I don't know who
he was talkin' about.

1659
01:53:16,606 --> 01:53:19,336
I don't even know
whether or not it was true.

1660
01:53:19,409 --> 01:53:23,607
But he was about to name
one of you, and I'll be damned...

1661
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:26,911
if I'll have one of my people
humiliated on public...

1662
01:53:26,983 --> 01:53:31,147
I mean, not that there's anything to be
embarrassed about, if it's true.

1663
01:53:31,221 --> 01:53:36,716
The point is, it's a normal
medical... What the hell are you
lookin' at, you redheaded putz?

1664
01:53:40,030 --> 01:53:43,363
Pack it up and go on home now.
Leave me in peace.

1665
01:53:45,602 --> 01:53:46,864
Don't come back now, you hear?

1666
01:53:46,937 --> 01:53:49,599
Well...

1667
01:53:49,673 --> 01:53:53,040
back to infomercials.

1668
01:53:53,109 --> 01:53:56,374
- Hey, I'm on TV! Look at me!
- Hi, Mom!

1669
01:54:04,788 --> 01:54:08,656
So Ed is no longer on TV.
Sam, how did he make out?

1670
01:54:08,725 --> 01:54:12,559
Ed made out like a bandit.
A spokesperson for True TV...

1671
01:54:12,629 --> 01:54:15,325
announced that Ed received a check
covering his four months on the air,

1672
01:54:15,398 --> 01:54:19,266
his balloon payment,
and an additional bonus...

1673
01:54:19,336 --> 01:54:23,238
to show the network's
appreciation for all his, quote,

1674
01:54:23,306 --> 01:54:27,003
"hard work and loyalty," unquote.

1675
01:54:27,077 --> 01:54:30,774
When asked exactly what happened,
a True TV spokesperson said,

1676
01:54:30,847 --> 01:54:35,216
they had no official comment,
but that things had been worked out.

1677
01:54:55,205 --> 01:55:00,575
Okay, let's do a final, uh...
Perhaps say good-bye here to Ed TV.

1678
01:55:00,644 --> 01:55:03,943
- Have we seen the last of Ed,
do you think?
- I would think so.

1679
01:55:04,014 --> 01:55:05,982
Five years, no one
will remember who he is.

1680
01:55:06,049 --> 01:55:10,486
- Five years? Six months.
He's a macarena.
- It's Ed Free TV now.

1681
01:55:15,486 --> 01:55:45,486
