1
00:00:09,821 --> 00:00:14,400
A friend of mine became a big-shot Hollywood director.

2
00:00:15,785 --> 00:00:19,320
He put himself in his own movies.

3
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:24,245
Big mistake.

4
00:00:27,756 --> 00:00:32,832
My oldest friend Jack teaches acting in the Valley
to people in refrigerator boxes.

5
00:00:34,512 --> 00:00:39,470
He said the idea came to him when he was
locked in a public bathroom for a night.

6
00:00:40,893 --> 00:00:46,184
Me, I own a laundromat.
My best friend has four legs and cataract.

7
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,184
We had gone out to Los Angeles to change the world.

8
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:56,521
And then we got hit, smack in the face
by something we hadn't seen coming: Fame.

9
00:00:58,703 --> 00:01:02,237
You 're fired!

10
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:29,802
It had been all over the news for the last few days.

11
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:33,510
my director friend, Pete Smalls, had taken the big swim.

12
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:37,304
No surprise, really, the way he'd been living.

13
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:41,942
I didn't really know how to feel about it
but I didn't have much time to think.

14
00:03:42,029 --> 00:03:45,065
I had some pressing problems of my own.

15
00:03:45,157 --> 00:03:50,115
<i>OK, I have the time and the place.
Seven-thirty, King's Tavern.</i>

16
00:03:50,203 --> 00:03:57,581
<i>You bring all the money. Ten thousand,
not five, not five and a half, you bring ten thousand dollars, you hear me?</i>

17
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:04,336
<i>And KC, do yourself a favour,
cause I'm known to do bad things to people.</i>

18
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:13,928
<i>... you piece of shit! How about I take your dog?</i>

19
00:04:15,895 --> 00:04:20,522
I owed ten thousand to a guy named Nimmo.
Ten thousand wasn't much, but

20
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:24,309
in the laundry business it was a lot of dirty sheets.

21
00:04:24,403 --> 00:04:28,531
<i>Hollywood headline has attained new information regarding
the drowning of world-renowned director, Pete Smalls.</i>

22
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:32,945
<i>Known best for the slapper trilogy,
"Blood Bucket 1, 2 and 3".</i>

23
00:04:33,037 --> 00:04:35,954
<i>Mr. Smalls was survived by his wife, Julia Smalls</i>

24
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,740
<i>whose only comment to the press was:
"my lawyers will deal with my pain".</i>

25
00:04:39,835 --> 00:04:42,836
Hollywood had loved Pete Smalls with all its heart.

26
00:04:42,922 --> 00:04:48,426
But behind the Hollywood sign it's written that all the
heart in tinsel town could fit in the navel of a fruit fly

27
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,555
and still have room for three caraway seeds.

28
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,182
We had drifted apart. I hardly knew Pete anymore.

29
00:04:57,269 --> 00:05:00,472
We lost what we once had.

30
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:04,983
We all lost something.

31
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:09,196
But that was then and I had to pay up now, or else.

32
00:05:38,017 --> 00:05:43,853
I can't say I don't see it coming,
but still, it came pretty hard.

33
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:49,065
You 'll get your almost-blind dog back
when you come up with the ten thousand!

34
00:05:52,156 --> 00:05:56,024
Oh, come on! Leave my dog alone!

35
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,491
Come on ...

36
00:06:00,581 --> 00:06:03,997
<i>weight gain and weight loss
that's a hard one for all of us -</i>

37
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:08,996
<i>but in extreme cases people have gained
large amounts of weight and lost it at the same time.</i>

38
00:06:26,273 --> 00:06:31,729
<i>KC, it's Jack. Pick up the god-damn phone,
Pete Smalls is dead.</i>

39
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:38,190
<i>Yeah, I heard, it's all over the news.
- So you're coming with me?</i>

40
00:06:38,285 --> 00:06:43,825
<i>I... I can't.
- What? Why not?</i>

41
00:06:47,043 --> 00:06:49,961
Uh, Nimmo beat me up and took my dog.

42
00:06:50,046 --> 00:06:52,917
<i>Yeah well, who's Nimmo?</i>
- A loan shark.</i>

43
00:06:53,008 --> 00:06:56,341
<i>He took your dog? Buddha? That can't stand, man.</i>

44
00:06:56,428 --> 00:07:00,128
You got ten thousand dollars?

45
00:07:00,223 --> 00:07:02,631
<i>yeah, I do.</i>
- Uh huh, yeah.</i>

46
00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:07,683
<i>I do, I do. I didn't before, but you come to the funeral -</i>

47
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:11,900
<i>you help me bury Pete, I'll get you your money.</i>

48
00:07:11,985 --> 00:07:17,359
<i>Yeah. OK. You know what, Jack, why don't you just send it to me?
- Ah, no way, no way.</i>

49
00:07:17,448 --> 00:07:25,194
<i>You... Look. You come out to LA,
you put Pete in the ground -</i>

50
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:28,954
<i>I get you your money. That's the deal.</i>

51
00:07:31,837 --> 00:07:36,416
I guess I had no choice but to take Jack up
on his deal and head out to LA.

52
00:07:49,812 --> 00:07:52,813
Come on, you big ape.

53
00:07:58,321 --> 00:08:05,451
I've been here for two hours.
What, are you walking here? Hello!

54
00:08:08,504 --> 00:08:10,822
Move! Damn! I missed it.

55
00:08:18,716 --> 00:08:22,464
Damn. I hate this airport.

56
00:08:22,553 --> 00:08:26,503
You're two hours late.
- Security stopped me.

57
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:31,675
And you pick me up in a... in a scooter. God-damn scooter.

58
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,815
My car is broken. This is a loaner. Come on!

59
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:40,276
Oh, we gotta go now.
- All right, Jack.

60
00:08:40,362 --> 00:08:46,945
If you had to pick my greatest flaw, what would it be?
- You're a liar, Jack.

61
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:49,953
Yeah, yeah, we're leaving.

62
00:09:00,186 --> 00:09:04,713
When am I gonna get my money, Jack?
- After the funeral, that was our deal.

63
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:08,713
All right. Well, I can't face
this Hollywood crap without a drink.

64
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:13,136
There'll be booze there.
- What if there isn't?

65
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:23,729
How long do you think Buddha is gonna live for?
- What do you mean?

66
00:09:23,821 --> 00:09:28,567
I mean, there's a difference,
if he's got 1 or 2 or if he's got, like, 7 or 8.

67
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:31,862
He's got a lot of life left in him, Jack.

68
00:09:31,954 --> 00:09:36,912
Did you get the change?
- No, there's no change. It's 10 bucks, come on.

69
00:09:39,628 --> 00:09:44,255
How's Julia handling all this?
- Oh, Julia's a fraud, man.

70
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:47,793
Pete and Julia's marriage was a fraud.

71
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:52,098
How's your blood pressure Jack?
- Why do you bring that up? I'm perfectly healthy.

72
00:09:52,182 --> 00:09:58,636
California-healthy.
You wanna wrestle? I will wrestle the shit out of you.

73
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:04,401
It's not too good uphills, is it Jack?
- I love the hills, man. Keep me in shape.

74
00:10:05,696 --> 00:10:08,697
Just enjoy the view.

75
00:10:11,034 --> 00:10:15,910
We're gonna be rolling in Bellevue, man.
- Oh yeah? - Yeah, rollin'

76
00:10:32,013 --> 00:10:36,841
It looked like Julia had taken the opportunity
to turn Pete's death into her own art show.

77
00:10:36,935 --> 00:10:39,936
She was always looking for some way to express herself.

78
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:44,647
Julia...
- Look what the cat dragged in.

79
00:10:44,734 --> 00:10:48,566
You wanna say hello?
- No, no.  That prick next to her, that's Hal Lazar,

80
00:10:48,654 --> 00:10:51,988
Pete's producer. They're fucking.

81
00:10:52,075 --> 00:10:55,609
I'm going to comfort her.
- No, comfort me.

82
00:10:57,121 --> 00:11:02,910
Brought the world's biggest leech with him.
- They'll be gone soon.

83
00:11:06,922 --> 00:11:12,462
We'll see whose ass is tight now.
- Come on, we're here for Pete.

84
00:11:12,553 --> 00:11:15,423
For Pete...

85
00:11:15,514 --> 00:11:20,057
Here man, I brought you some M&Ms.
I know that you like the blue ones.

86
00:11:20,144 --> 00:11:22,386
I like the orange.

87
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:26,429
Jesus Christ, it says "no touching". Can't they read?

88
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:31,436
What did they do to him?
- Yeah. Looks like old Pete's made of marzipan.

89
00:11:33,282 --> 00:11:37,149
Weird. Gimme a hit of that.

90
00:11:37,244 --> 00:11:42,036
Oh, shit!
- Get them off Pete, Hal.

91
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,088
It's a fake, man. It's a fake!

92
00:11:49,172 --> 00:11:51,976
I came to bury a friend, not a toy.

93
00:11:51,976 --> 00:11:52,981
Get away from him Jack!

94
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,807
Where is my friend Pete?
- Oh, my God! Oh no!

95
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:04,019
OK, everyone, settle down, this is a family matter.
- I'm calling the police!

96
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:06,262
Go ahead!

97
00:12:16,032 --> 00:12:19,401
It was really nice work, Julia.

98
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:26,455
You know, you smoked all your friends to the bone
and now you're back in town. Why?

99
00:12:29,045 --> 00:12:36,127
Jack really loved Pete, you  know?
- Jack is fucking crazy!

100
00:12:42,391 --> 00:12:48,061
This town has no love for you, KC.
If I was you, I'd stay away.

101
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:52,190
Well. I'm just passing through. I'm gonna get my dog back.

102
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:55,608
That same dog?

103
00:12:56,696 --> 00:13:00,740
I always thought that dog was the best thing about you, KC.

104
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:14,671
Julia said you can see Pete. And she made the head.

105
00:13:15,923 --> 00:13:19,624
I knew it, didn't look a thing like him.

106
00:13:19,718 --> 00:13:24,629
Can I get my money now?

107
00:13:24,723 --> 00:13:30,726
Why you gotta ask me that all the time?
Yeah, after we see Pete.

108
00:13:45,952 --> 00:13:49,997
Is he gonna get hysterical?
- No, he'll be fine.

109
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:09,755
Fucking traitor!
- What are you doing? Come on, stop!

110
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:13,054
You're not fighting back now, huh?

111
00:14:17,442 --> 00:14:20,478
What?
- Shh, quiet!

112
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:40,751
I have glow sticks.
- We're not fucking camping Jack!

113
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,209
It's not an expedition.
- All right, all right.

114
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:51,549
You know, KC, Pete stole your screenplay, man.

115
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:56,304
I know, it sounds really nuts,
and I should have told you before

116
00:14:56,397 --> 00:15:00,145
but I had to get you out of the laundromat
so that you could see what

117
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:04,018
this fat slub of whale blubber
really was making a mess of out here...

118
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:08,157
I never wrote a god-damn Kung-Fu script, Jack.

119
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:13,034
That chop suey shit, that was all Hal-schmucko's idea.

120
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:20,787
You get me out here with your "I'm gonna get you
your money" shit. You're lying to me.

121
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:47,772
The minute he showed up at the airport on that tinker toy,
I should have known I was in trouble.

122
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:52,822
Jack was the prince of all tomorrows,
but I needed my dog back today.

123
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,703
You're lying to me.
- What, was I supposed to tell you the truth?

124
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:04,746
You would have never come here. You'd still be waiting
for Buddha's paw to come to you in the mail, man.

125
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,131
Look at this.

126
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:17,049
Look, look at the back. Look at it!

127
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,725
<i>REMEMBER ME</i>

128
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:25,391
This came a week before Pete took a swim.

129
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:34,197
He stole your script, word for god-damn word.
He drank himself fat over it, he drank himself sick over it.

130
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,795
Why would Pete do that, Jack?
- Because he was scared.

131
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:54,632
You saw his last two films.
- No.

132
00:16:54,721 --> 00:17:02,729
Well, don't. It's not right this fucker Hal Lazar
should head off with your script.

133
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:07,474
Look at this. Come around. Look at that shit.

134
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:10,402
Look! Can you see it?

135
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:14,983
Yeah. You know what? People fuck people
in Hollywood all the time, so what?

136
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:24,747
I've got a lawyer. Says he's got a financier partner.

137
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:29,163
He'll buy Pete's film for something over cost.

138
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:32,588
I mean, we've got Hal Lazar over a barrel.

139
00:17:32,675 --> 00:17:36,375
You know, this may be a chance for you
to get back on your feet.

140
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:41,595
Ten years? Don't you think that
that is maybe just long enough?

141
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:49,356
I mean, the way you walk around with, like,
bad luck is your only friend?

142
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:52,063
She would have never wanted that.

143
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:03,947
So when are you meeting these big-shot Hollywood guys?

144
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:06,611
Tomorrow.

145
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:13,792
I need to prove that it's my script.
- Is Pete's editor proof enough?

146
00:18:16,383 --> 00:18:20,761
There is one thing.
- What?

147
00:18:20,846 --> 00:18:23,717
She's French.

148
00:18:40,949 --> 00:18:45,528
You have a boo-boo?
- Yeah, boo-boo. Wait, what?

149
00:18:45,621 --> 00:18:49,321
Come.
- Where are you going?

150
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,203
First I must take care of him.

151
00:18:52,294 --> 00:18:55,248
Are you gonna show KC some film?

152
00:19:03,596 --> 00:19:07,012
Do you like it?
- It's nice.

153
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:10,883
You keep it.
- No.

154
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:13,980
Please, keep it.

155
00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:17,897
Sorry. Now let me see.

156
00:19:34,043 --> 00:19:36,914
Your script is beautiful.

157
00:19:37,004 --> 00:19:42,425
Is it my script?
- Yes, of course.

158
00:19:45,054 --> 00:19:49,716
It was torn to pieces, for what he did.

159
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:55,644
He loved you, KC Munk. More than
a man should love another man.

160
00:19:56,941 --> 00:20:03,821
So what did happen to Pete that night?
- On the set he was a wild, wild man.

161
00:20:03,906 --> 00:20:08,733
He was to play the Kung-Fu Master Suey.

162
00:20:08,827 --> 00:20:14,332
He was filled with disdain and the crew laugh at him.

163
00:20:15,542 --> 00:20:17,700
And he makes them fired.

164
00:20:17,794 --> 00:20:21,958
<i>Are you all right in there?
- Jack, please, shut your mouth when you speak!</i>

165
00:20:22,048 --> 00:20:27,802
I'm not supposed to have persons in here.
If I'm caught with you, I'm in trouble. Bad!

166
00:20:27,888 --> 00:20:31,885
You know, get him done. What's up?

167
00:20:31,975 --> 00:20:36,388
The last I saw him, He wandered down the beach.

168
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,979
I think to swim.
- Do you think so?

169
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:42,771
I think. To swim.

170
00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:54,744
I should have never left him alone.

171
00:20:54,831 --> 00:20:58,994
What the fucker, Jack!
- Who the fuck is Jack, sugar-tits?

172
00:20:59,085 --> 00:21:02,121
Just a minute, Monsieur Bob!
- Are you fucking someone in here, in the other room?

173
00:21:02,213 --> 00:21:05,712
If I'm found with you, I'm thrown out on the street.
Totally empty, without my clothes.

174
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:12,763
<i>I'm going to cut the shit out of this shit.</i>

175
00:21:12,848 --> 00:21:17,510
<i>Go!
- I'm ... Oh, here you are.</i>

176
00:21:17,603 --> 00:21:23,558
<i>I was just going home, Monsieur Lazar.
- My editor's home, is the editing room.</i>

177
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:31,279
Please, please. Come on. It's all right.

178
00:21:33,744 --> 00:21:38,287
I want you to cut everything with the fat priest in it.

179
00:21:38,373 --> 00:21:40,580
You can't be serious.

180
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:45,662
I have an 18 million dollar movie that nobody wants to buy.

181
00:21:45,756 --> 00:21:49,338
So, yes, I'm serious.

182
00:21:57,934 --> 00:22:02,726
<i>If Jack and Saskia were right and Pete
had stolen my script and shot a movie from it</i>

183
00:22:02,814 --> 00:22:07,108
<i>then it had to be worth enough to get Buddha back.</i>

184
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,781
That woman is really something.

185
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:18,327
Don't get too worked up. She's in love with Pete.

186
00:22:18,413 --> 00:22:22,410
Pete is dead. What, is she gonna
mourn him for the rest of her life?

187
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,660
Usually it takes more than a week to get over
the death of someone you loved, Jack.

188
00:22:27,755 --> 00:22:31,456
Wait, hold up. Let me get that card again.

189
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:37,920
I think there's potential. I know there's
something between us, you know, underneath.

190
00:22:42,937 --> 00:22:45,688
Do you want the card?

191
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:59,733
Xan?

192
00:23:01,622 --> 00:23:04,955
What are you doing here?
- I hate mum, dad.

193
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:07,615
And what the hell are you inhaling there?

194
00:23:11,547 --> 00:23:14,963
Remember KC? Yeah?

195
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:48,617
I can't be at mom's.

196
00:23:48,709 --> 00:23:53,121
Dad, I'm in love with Aram. We're gonna live together.

197
00:23:55,465 --> 00:23:58,585
Who's Aram? I don't know who Aram is.

198
00:23:58,677 --> 00:24:04,715
Last year, you gave out Valentine's Day
cards to like, fifty different guys.

199
00:24:04,808 --> 00:24:07,643
Father, I've had my period.

200
00:24:20,198 --> 00:24:25,192
Is that the big lover guy over there hiding behind the tree?

201
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:31,415
Is he that Armenian kid?
- Yeah.

202
00:24:31,501 --> 00:24:35,961
Let me tell you something about Armenians.
You know, their country is right next to Greece.

203
00:24:36,047 --> 00:24:41,172
If you know anything about real homosexuality ...
- Oh dad, believe me, Aram is not ...

204
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,510
Hey, hey!

205
00:24:44,597 --> 00:24:50,801
God! It's like yesterday I bought
you a beautiful princess dress.

206
00:24:50,895 --> 00:24:53,682
Now, you just want to take it off.

207
00:24:53,772 --> 00:24:57,307
You're still my little baby girl, right?

208
00:24:57,401 --> 00:25:00,936
Even if you're gonna get married now.

209
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:05,988
Aram and I are not getting married.
- No? - No.

210
00:25:16,586 --> 00:25:19,671
Fuck! Oh, shit!

211
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:53,620
You know, I was thinking, KC ... Maybe
that loan shark of yours will take less.

212
00:25:53,706 --> 00:25:59,293
Maybe take, like, four, four and a half grand
or something like that.

213
00:26:00,379 --> 00:26:05,421
I don't pay rent, I can get that together really easy.

214
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:11,630
Jack, your producer guy and his lawyer
have their own money, right?

215
00:26:11,724 --> 00:26:16,552
Man, oodles. Oodles, piles... tons.

216
00:26:17,772 --> 00:26:23,192
They capitalize. That's the word around town, anyway.

217
00:26:28,824 --> 00:26:32,193
You know, I'm really glad you're here.

218
00:26:41,211 --> 00:26:44,248
Did you ever fool around with Julia?
- What?

219
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:47,459
Did you ever fool around with Julia?

220
00:26:51,763 --> 00:26:54,468
Once or twice.

221
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,644
I can't believe that!

222
00:27:00,855 --> 00:27:05,517
I don't think I could ever be that mad at my dick.

223
00:27:07,487 --> 00:27:10,274
Go to sleep, Jack.

224
00:27:14,786 --> 00:27:17,407
Good night.
- Nighty-night.

225
00:27:31,344 --> 00:27:35,721
<i>You have a boo-boo? Do you have a boo-boo?</i>

226
00:27:37,224 --> 00:27:39,846
<i>You have a boo-boo.</i>

227
00:27:51,572 --> 00:27:54,442
<i>Pete has a boo-boo.</i>

228
00:27:57,828 --> 00:27:59,737
<i>Doggy has a boo-boo.</i>

229
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:07,170
<i>Doggy has a boo-boo.</i>

230
00:28:09,464 --> 00:28:12,964
<i>Pete has a boo-boo.</i>

231
00:28:59,221 --> 00:29:02,008
What was that?
- Nothing.

232
00:29:02,098 --> 00:29:04,850
Your worst nightmare.

233
00:29:08,396 --> 00:29:11,765
<i>You have to  kiss a lot of frogs to find your Prince.</i>

234
00:29:11,858 --> 00:29:15,025
<i>So Jack and I went frog-kissing.</i>

235
00:29:37,508 --> 00:29:42,300
Why don't you guys have something to eat?
They have an avocado salad here that will give you an erection.

236
00:29:42,388 --> 00:29:48,343
Maybe I'll take one home, for emergencies.
KC, what about you, do you want an erection?

237
00:29:49,395 --> 00:29:52,182
I think I'm gonna wait outside.

238
00:29:52,273 --> 00:29:56,484
Should have asked if they had
one of them kiddy-chairs for you.

239
00:29:59,071 --> 00:30:01,396
You want us to ask?

240
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:06,733
Wait till the medication kicks in.
- Bernie, how about an avocado salad?

241
00:30:06,829 --> 00:30:09,402
You know I don't eat that greasy crap.

242
00:30:09,498 --> 00:30:13,116
Lenny owns an avocado farm.
That's why he's always pushing them.

243
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:18,038
I'm gonna get some air.
- Anyway, it is terrific to meet you.

244
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:22,461
I'm a huge fan. Shannah, say hello.

245
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:26,336
This is my assistant, Shannah.
- Most people have two names, Bernie.

246
00:30:26,431 --> 00:30:32,018
Most people aren't like you, Shannah.
You gotta ask my wife about that.

247
00:30:32,103 --> 00:30:35,223
I'm gonna get some air, Jack.

248
00:30:36,942 --> 00:30:41,568
Is there a problem?
Lenny, did you say something off-colour, or something?

249
00:30:41,654 --> 00:30:45,782
What the fuck? Not a word. What are you talking about?
- He can be a little uncouth sometimes.

250
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:50,410
But, listen. Between us, we have produced over 48 pictures.

251
00:30:50,496 --> 00:30:54,115
Do you want the titles?
- I'm going to step out now.

252
00:30:56,794 --> 00:30:59,712
All right, whatever. Hey, I'm a fan!

253
00:30:59,797 --> 00:31:06,630
I get it. But the bottom line is Pete Smalls is a genius.

254
00:31:06,721 --> 00:31:09,971
I want this film.

255
00:31:10,057 --> 00:31:15,644
And I will pay whatever it is. Up to 20 million.
- I told you.

256
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,971
Bernie is in love.

257
00:31:18,065 --> 00:31:22,608
Listen. We're gonna move the money from an offshore account.

258
00:31:22,695 --> 00:31:27,522
This has got to be for domestic and worldwide rights, capisce?

259
00:31:27,616 --> 00:31:31,828
No problem.
- All right. Shannah, go outside...

260
00:31:31,912 --> 00:31:34,913
I want you to ask me nicely.

261
00:31:34,998 --> 00:31:40,419
Please go outside and inform Mr. Smalls,
that we are finished with the bullshit business

262
00:31:40,504 --> 00:31:44,336
and we can get back to some serious fucking around.
- Bernie, wait a minute.

263
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:47,674
That's not Smalls out there, breathing in the parking lot.

264
00:31:47,761 --> 00:31:52,886
That's Jack's partner, Munk.
- KC Munk, you know?

265
00:31:52,974 --> 00:31:58,051
What the fuck, you told me I was meeting with Pete Smalls!
- Don't blame me for this fuck-up, asshole.

266
00:31:58,146 --> 00:32:03,520
See, this is what I get for hiring a pair of tits.
- You know what? Fuck your job.

267
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:07,358
Write with your hand, then try fucking your wife.

268
00:32:10,408 --> 00:32:14,157
Hey! That was rude!

269
00:32:17,749 --> 00:32:21,746
I think there's been a misunderstanding.
- No, no, don't worry about her.

270
00:32:21,836 --> 00:32:25,964
She's just another fucked-up kid,
who wants everything right away.

271
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:32,253
You guys understand, Pete Smalls is dead, right?

272
00:32:35,016 --> 00:32:39,476
I didn't know that.
- What do you mean dead?

273
00:32:39,562 --> 00:32:45,185
You mean, unfinanceable?
- He's dead. Like, funeral-dead.

274
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:51,568
Why am I sitting here,
if Pete Smalls is washed-up, dead corpse?

275
00:32:51,657 --> 00:32:58,454
Hold on. I'll tell you why you're sitting here. You're sitting here
because "dead" and "dead" are two different things. You follow?

276
00:33:00,749 --> 00:33:04,877
You'd better start making some sense, lawyer-brains
because if Pete Smalls' name is not on this film, I don't want it.

277
00:33:04,962 --> 00:33:08,378
From the grave, to your living room.

278
00:33:08,465 --> 00:33:12,961
Pete Smalls speaks from the beyond.

279
00:33:16,348 --> 00:33:19,551
That's good.
- OK.

280
00:33:19,643 --> 00:33:23,723
Let's say I like Pete Smalls being dead. Let's say I get it.

281
00:33:23,814 --> 00:33:28,106
That's gonna knock off a few million. Right? Is that fair?

282
00:33:28,192 --> 00:33:31,976
It's good. Whatever you guys think.
- We'll do an ad campaign.

283
00:33:32,071 --> 00:33:37,860
All right? Get this, watch: "Pete Smalls,
the director from behind. "

284
00:33:37,951 --> 00:33:41,071
Beyond.
- OK, let me finish.

285
00:33:41,163 --> 00:33:44,413
"The director who refused to die."

286
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:50,620
It'll be like an Elvis thing.
- That's good, Elvis. Whatever you guys think.

287
00:33:50,714 --> 00:33:56,752
"Pete Smalls Is Dead?
I do not think so. I saw him at Ralph's last week."

288
00:33:56,845 --> 00:33:59,301
You did?

289
00:34:03,643 --> 00:34:07,511
You said they have money, Jack.
- I said they have access to money.

290
00:34:07,606 --> 00:34:12,066
Oh yeah? Who paid for the coffee?
- Bernie is hot on the idea that Pete's dead.

291
00:34:13,403 --> 00:34:19,192
I can get these guys to buy that film from Lazar.
And then we finish it.

292
00:34:19,284 --> 00:34:24,907
You know what? If I go to Lazar and ask him
politely as I can for the 20.000 dollars, that's it.

293
00:34:24,998 --> 00:34:29,743
20.000 shit-ass dollars?
- Half of which is yours. 10.000 dollars.

294
00:34:29,836 --> 00:34:34,296
But me? I'm gonna go home, I'm gonna get my dog.

295
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:39,594
Where are you walking to?

296
00:34:44,475 --> 00:34:47,096
Later!

297
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:18,124
I'm gonna get you your money.
You just got to promise me one thing.

298
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:22,760
That you stick around and see this
through to the end, god fuck it.

299
00:35:22,846 --> 00:35:28,600
Where are you are going to get me my money now, Jack?
- Look. Pete hooked me up with his uncle Saco.

300
00:35:28,685 --> 00:35:34,474
He's got a garage, he let me teach there for nothing.
This guy, he is loaded.

301
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:38,610
He doesn't just fix mufflers. And he loves dogs.

302
00:35:38,695 --> 00:35:42,360
If this doesn't work, we go to Lazar.

303
00:35:42,449 --> 00:35:46,031
Now, get on. Come on.

304
00:35:50,331 --> 00:35:52,953
Come on, get on.

305
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:06,878
<i>Jack took me to a garage on the corner of Argyle and Vine
where someone had stuck a fig tree in the ground-</i>

306
00:36:06,973 --> 00:36:12,429
<i>and named the ten square blocks east of the 101
"Little Armenia".</i>

307
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,993
For you. They fly to Mexico.

308
00:36:36,085 --> 00:36:41,838
Monsieur Monk... Pretty, non?
- What are you doing here?

309
00:36:41,924 --> 00:36:47,262
I live over there, and my engine is stinking
on my piece-of-shit auto. And you?

310
00:36:48,764 --> 00:36:53,509
Jack's up there to get me some money,
so I can get my dog back.

311
00:36:53,602 --> 00:36:58,560
Sounds like this dog is a very important doggy.
- Yeah.

312
00:36:58,648 --> 00:37:02,978
Come, come.
- What are you going to do?

313
00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:06,403
About what?
- About the rape of your work.

314
00:37:06,489 --> 00:37:11,151
I don't know yet.
- When you know, give it to me.

315
00:37:20,295 --> 00:37:23,913
They took his dog.
- Jack, please. Don't explain anymore.

316
00:37:25,925 --> 00:37:31,132
Jack, I beg you. Too many words can tear your heart.

317
00:37:31,222 --> 00:37:34,673
Sorry. Could you just give him the money?

318
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,140
Do you want your dog back?

319
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:45,518
Yeah.

320
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:49,443
I'll get your dog.
- How?

321
00:37:49,532 --> 00:37:52,901
Why are you talking to me like an animal?

322
00:37:52,993 --> 00:37:57,287
Maybe you don't believe me.
- My dog is sick.

323
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:04,457
I said I get your dog, I get your dog.
Do you understand me, KC Munk? Man to man?

324
00:38:04,546 --> 00:38:07,464
I understand.
- OK.

325
00:38:08,967 --> 00:38:12,586
Look. Now we talk more seriously.

326
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:17,222
What do you know about women?
- They have teeth.

327
00:38:17,309 --> 00:38:21,009
They have teeth, yeah, they have teeth that bite you.

328
00:38:21,104 --> 00:38:25,731
And they bite you everywhere,
and you like that bite. Bitey-bitey!

329
00:38:25,817 --> 00:38:30,728
I like it, you're a film maker.
And I talk to you like a film maker.

330
00:38:30,822 --> 00:38:34,736
I'm not a film maker. I was.
- No "was", is!

331
00:38:36,076 --> 00:38:40,288
You make me a love film, I get your dog, I promise.

332
00:38:40,372 --> 00:38:44,156
What kind of film?
- A love film.

333
00:38:45,544 --> 00:38:51,463
What kind of film is that?
- Love that burns your brain.

334
00:38:52,676 --> 00:38:56,626
And the more you look at it, the more it burns.

335
00:38:56,722 --> 00:39:00,137
And the more it burns, the more you want.

336
00:39:00,225 --> 00:39:06,512
Not that you forget your beauty dog.

337
00:39:06,606 --> 00:39:09,180
But close.

338
00:39:11,903 --> 00:39:14,275
Now ...

339
00:39:30,046 --> 00:39:32,916
Why are you dancing?
- Because I want to.

340
00:39:33,007 --> 00:39:38,214
He's talking about a porno film, Jack.
- He said "love".

341
00:39:38,304 --> 00:39:42,551
Pornography.
- He said "love"!

342
00:39:42,642 --> 00:39:46,058
You are such a nay-sayer!
- We're going to Lazar's.

343
00:39:46,145 --> 00:39:49,063
<i>With Jack's heart as our GPS, we were lost.</i>

344
00:39:53,152 --> 00:39:57,315
<i>Being lost with him was ok,
but if I let him know I felt that way</i>

345
00:39:57,406 --> 00:40:01,653
<i>I was afraid he'd take me in that scooter
and head straight for the moon.</i>

346
00:40:07,416 --> 00:40:10,203
20.000...

347
00:40:12,087 --> 00:40:17,461
Are you threatening me?
- Pete never owned the rights to the script.

348
00:40:17,551 --> 00:40:22,177
So that amounts to stolen property, right?
- Shut up, Jack.

349
00:40:22,264 --> 00:40:26,131
KC, I would never start a movie -

350
00:40:26,226 --> 00:40:32,845
with an overweight, strung-out, washed up,
ignorant director without rights.

351
00:40:32,941 --> 00:40:37,402
You're bluffing.
- All I want is the 20 grand and...

352
00:40:37,487 --> 00:40:41,567
Blah, blah, blah...

353
00:40:41,658 --> 00:40:44,825
Knock if off, KC.

354
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:55,462
You gave Pete your screenplay at Odessa Restaurant.
- The hell I did.

355
00:40:55,547 --> 00:41:04,088
You did. He paid 150 dollars for your rent
so, you gave him your screenplay.

356
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:09,056
Oh and as I recall, you also kissed him for it.

357
00:41:09,143 --> 00:41:13,604
What is it, Julia? That's a bunch of shit.

358
00:41:13,689 --> 00:41:18,897
150 dollars was a lot back then. Wasn't it?

359
00:41:48,891 --> 00:41:53,517
Man, I've got, like, 1800 bucks.

360
00:41:53,603 --> 00:41:58,016
That's for Xan's college.
- That's not gonna do it.

361
00:41:58,108 --> 00:42:02,651
<i>Jack was a human mood ring
and I think he was about to turn purple.</i>

362
00:42:02,737 --> 00:42:07,234
<i>He had everything riding on this and it had been
pulled out from under him by a greasy napkin</i>

363
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:11,868
<i>signed at the Odessa restaurant 15 years ago.</i>

364
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:20,201
<i>I just wanted my dog, but Jack had wanted a lot more.</i>

365
00:42:22,257 --> 00:42:26,385
<i>I was thinking about  Buddha,
but I was also thinking about Saskia.</i>

366
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,890
<i>I couldn't see what she saw in Pete.
I know movies were like religion to the French,</i>

367
00:42:31,974 --> 00:42:34,548
<i>and to them, Jerry Lewis was a god.</i>

368
00:42:34,644 --> 00:42:37,728
<i>But still, to work so hard for Pete</i>

369
00:42:37,814 --> 00:42:42,226
<i>he'd gone soft long ago.
Maybe she knew something I didn't know.</i>

370
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:46,695
<i>This is Nimmo's answer machine. Right now I'm out
walking the dog. I'll call you back when the fucker...</i>

371
00:42:46,781 --> 00:42:50,944
I'm sorry about your dog KC.
I'm sure everything will work out ok.

372
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:53,905
Do you think so?
- Sure.

373
00:42:56,123 --> 00:42:59,243
What is he doing?

374
00:43:00,586 --> 00:43:04,286
So, why are men like diapers, KC?
- I don't know. Why?

375
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:08,379
Cause they're always on my ass and full of shit.

376
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:12,418
One of these is yours. Sure looks like someone needs help.

377
00:43:12,514 --> 00:43:15,800
Porno is addictive, dad.

378
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:19,807
I thought you were in the shower.
- Don't worry about it dad. Aram and I have seen these already.

379
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:22,601
Twice.

380
00:43:25,193 --> 00:43:29,321
She's a good kid.
- There's a bond of trust between us.

381
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:32,490
It's the trustworthy ones you've got to look out for.

382
00:43:33,869 --> 00:43:36,573
What's this?

383
00:43:38,873 --> 00:43:42,918
You got one too? Why didn't you tell me?

384
00:43:43,003 --> 00:43:47,913
I didn't know what they meant.
- It meant that Pete was in deep shit and needed our help.

385
00:43:48,006 --> 00:43:51,921
I don't think Pete sent them.
- Then who did?

386
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:56,471
Of course, I did. I did every job for Pete.
Look at this shit.

387
00:43:56,556 --> 00:44:01,017
Now I destroy this film.
- You sent both these cards.

388
00:44:01,103 --> 00:44:05,183
He gave me three cards, I sent them.

389
00:44:05,273 --> 00:44:08,808
What three?
- These and Joey-something.

390
00:44:08,902 --> 00:44:14,738
Joey Sausa! Joey Sausa? Sausa?

391
00:44:14,824 --> 00:44:20,448
<i>Joey Sausa. Fat-Joey we called him.
The four of us used to kick around in New York,</i>

392
00:44:20,538 --> 00:44:24,618
<i>before we chipped in to get him
an airplane ticket to come to LA.</i>

393
00:44:24,709 --> 00:44:29,252
<i>LA hadn't treated him so good.
He ended up in a motel watching TV</i>

394
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:33,383
<i>and getting Jack to drive him
to the methadone clinic once a week.</i>

395
00:44:33,468 --> 00:44:36,552
Joey! I worry about Pete.

396
00:44:37,764 --> 00:44:41,512
<i>Pizza delivery.
- Fuck it, get in here!</i>

397
00:44:41,601 --> 00:44:46,939
Panda pizza.
- Joey, look. The problem is that KC signed...

398
00:44:47,023 --> 00:44:51,316
That's up in the drawer, yellow envelope!

399
00:44:57,158 --> 00:45:04,288
KC, come here! We've got Lazar now.

400
00:45:04,373 --> 00:45:10,494
It says, Pete says it was your original screenplay.
Right there, notarized.

401
00:45:10,587 --> 00:45:12,913
We've got the fucker!

402
00:45:13,006 --> 00:45:19,127
Where did you get this paper, Joey?
- Pete was your friend, KC.

403
00:45:19,221 --> 00:45:23,266
And when he comes by, all fucked up like he was

404
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:28,475
and he gives me an envelope, I don't say nothing.

405
00:45:28,563 --> 00:45:33,309
<i>So the director from beyond reached
out of the grave and gave us life again.</i>

406
00:45:33,402 --> 00:45:38,313
<i>He had turned the rights back over to me
and threw that wrinkled napkin in the trash.</i>

407
00:45:58,009 --> 00:46:02,007
Can I help you?
- Health department.

408
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:20,853
Are you ready?

409
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:25,780
Your play.

410
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:30,366
For the boss.

411
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:34,875
He didn't order soup.

412
00:46:34,962 --> 00:46:38,497
My god, I am a big fan of yours.
- Jack, what do you want?

413
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:42,802
You know, maybe you want to take a look at this.

414
00:46:42,886 --> 00:46:45,757
I teach a class on Tuesday nights in the valley...

415
00:46:45,848 --> 00:46:49,596
You know, maybe you want to stop by,
cause after that movie...

416
00:46:49,685 --> 00:46:53,385
Jack, come here.
- Wait a minute.

417
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:59,981
The name is Games, Jack Games.

418
00:47:12,582 --> 00:47:16,995
I should be dancing on your
fucking entrails right now. Guys?

419
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:20,586
That sounds like you want to negotiate.
That's a good choice.

420
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,971
That's my negotiation.

421
00:47:33,061 --> 00:47:38,351
Word is Pete Smalls' picture is a mess.
Jack is a guy that's gonna cover the cost of the negative.

422
00:47:38,441 --> 00:47:42,106
These guys are for real.

423
00:47:44,655 --> 00:47:47,989
Uncomfortable?
- A little.

424
00:47:48,075 --> 00:47:55,157
You come to me, and you bring 16 million dollars
personally, and we'll have something to talk about.

425
00:47:55,249 --> 00:47:58,250
That's good.
- Okay, good.

426
00:48:08,721 --> 00:48:12,006
That's sorted out.

427
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:16,808
As a rule I don't like looking down at people,
I like eye to eye -

428
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:23,514
so, bearing that in mind, I either got to get down on my knees in front of you
or I'll have to have Alfie here to get you up on me.

429
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:27,193
No, I can do that. In the future I can do that.

430
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,981
I don't get on my knees for...

431
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:40,582
Bob, give Mr. Munk here 10.000 dollars.

432
00:48:40,669 --> 00:48:43,919
For his dog.

433
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,505
Right now? I don't...

434
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:54,592
It's what you want, isn't it?

435
00:48:54,681 --> 00:49:01,680
I have 500. How about I give you 500
and I'll do the rest in a check?

436
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:05,057
Is that cool?

437
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,320
Go get another dog.

438
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:20,119
Remember, cream rises to the top.

439
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:33,500
You are a waste, Munk.

440
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:40,224
How is it?
- I think I can put it back together.

441
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:44,806
I meant the finger.
- What? Oh, that will mend.

442
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:52,811
What were you doing in there?
- He offered me money.

443
00:49:52,905 --> 00:49:57,152
I'll see you later.
- Thank you so much, baby.

444
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:04,285
And what did you do?

445
00:50:08,003 --> 00:50:11,668
I punched his fist with my stomach.

446
00:50:13,133 --> 00:50:16,798
Ow!
- The price for doing business.

447
00:50:16,887 --> 00:50:21,264
Did you hear him say 16 mil?
- I heard your finger snap.

448
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:25,299
<i>I had just turned down the 10 grand
that would get Buddha back.</i>

449
00:50:25,395 --> 00:50:30,734
<i>Was I stupid? Was I back to my old ways
of saying no to people who I didn't like?</i>

450
00:50:34,196 --> 00:50:38,489
Let me do the talking, I get the personal connection.

451
00:50:38,575 --> 00:50:43,818
Yeah, yeah, what?
- We got the Pete Smalls deal.

452
00:50:43,914 --> 00:50:50,995
Len, it's Chico and his chihuahua, here with some deal.
- What the fuck, I don't want to hear any more bullshit.

453
00:50:51,087 --> 00:50:53,792
Come on in guys.
- Chico and his chihuahua?

454
00:50:53,882 --> 00:50:58,508
That's the way friends joke around. Forget it.

455
00:51:01,097 --> 00:51:05,177
<i>So we are back to kissing frogs.</i>

456
00:51:05,268 --> 00:51:08,886
Fuck you!
- Have a seat.

457
00:51:13,734 --> 00:51:18,443
So, look. Smalls' picture is a "go".
My foreign guys like it. - That's great.

458
00:51:18,531 --> 00:51:22,742
<i>Paging doctor Fine.
- What's this?</i>

459
00:51:22,827 --> 00:51:29,031
That's a contract that says that KC owns
the screenplay that Hal Lazar never purchased.

460
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:33,418
Who's Lazar?
- Hell fucked-up Lazar, he owns Smalls' picture.

461
00:51:33,504 --> 00:51:38,332
Well... word is, it needs a little tinkering.

462
00:51:38,425 --> 00:51:44,049
Maybe it needs a little work but this says
he does not own the picture, free and clear.

463
00:51:44,139 --> 00:51:50,593
<i>Doctor Fine, paging doctor Fine...</i>
- Well good then, he'll sell it to us real cheap.</i>

464
00:51:50,687 --> 00:51:54,934
Listen, I got to go back and make a call,
so I'm gonna apologize in advance.

465
00:51:55,025 --> 00:52:00,861
<i>Surgery, doctor Fine!</i>
- Lenny here is gonna take care of all the details, right?</i>

466
00:52:00,947 --> 00:52:04,530
You gotta forgive him, he's got a weakness for clam.

467
00:52:04,618 --> 00:52:07,784
It drains him, he's unable to concentrate.

468
00:52:07,871 --> 00:52:11,156
It's my opinion that sex with women is for fairies.

469
00:52:12,959 --> 00:52:18,416
So, when do we get our financing?
- Fuck you!

470
00:52:20,258 --> 00:52:23,592
I say that with all the love in the world.

471
00:52:23,678 --> 00:52:28,387
What you guys got to know is that
the money is good and we're financing pictures.

472
00:52:28,474 --> 00:52:32,223
Ask around if you don't trust us.
- I hate you!

473
00:52:32,312 --> 00:52:36,356
Is that the best you can do, sweetheart?

474
00:52:36,441 --> 00:52:40,652
Wait, where are you going?
- Don't worry, she'll be back.

475
00:52:42,113 --> 00:52:48,116
It's this twisted little game they play.
They call it "that hoof".

476
00:52:48,202 --> 00:52:54,454
It's some kind of sick, fucked-up torture routine
that keeps them hot for each other.

477
00:52:54,542 --> 00:53:00,331
Really? What about our deal?
- It's Buddha!

478
00:53:00,422 --> 00:53:07,255
Buddha? What, is he on acid?
- Where are you going? Thanks.

479
00:53:10,724 --> 00:53:14,259
Buddha! Boo-boo!

480
00:53:22,194 --> 00:53:28,943
Munk! We're this close, and then you go fucking bananas!

481
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:40,702
Hey, Buddha! Hey, open up!

482
00:53:40,795 --> 00:53:43,333
Saco!

483
00:53:45,759 --> 00:53:50,006
Come on, I'm not fucking around, man. Come on!

484
00:54:04,693 --> 00:54:08,773
Something stinks, KC.
- You live across the street from Saco.

485
00:54:08,864 --> 00:54:13,822
Everyone has to live somewhere.
- He said he would help me get my dog.

486
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:17,575
I just saw my dog.
- So what?

487
00:54:17,664 --> 00:54:23,500
<i>Par hazard, it's not about that. It's not
about your doggy, or your postcards. Merde!</i>

488
00:54:34,681 --> 00:54:39,058
<i>I needed answers, but I couldn't
understand a word of what she was saying.</i>

489
00:54:39,143 --> 00:54:44,600
<i>Her eyes were telling me something,
something I hadn't heard in a long time.</i>

490
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:48,688
<i>Something I probably should listen to.</i>

491
00:54:51,822 --> 00:54:54,195
What do you think?

492
00:54:55,701 --> 00:55:00,992
About what?
- That I'm canned, fucked beyond words!

493
00:55:01,082 --> 00:55:06,242
I refused to let that sadist pig

494
00:55:06,337 --> 00:55:10,548
use Pete's name to make this "love movie".

495
00:55:10,633 --> 00:55:13,337
So I'm thrown out.
- What did he call it?

496
00:55:13,427 --> 00:55:16,132
"Love movie".

497
00:55:16,221 --> 00:55:21,132
Lazar knows nothing about love.

498
00:55:21,226 --> 00:55:27,940
He called it a "love movie"?
- We have something in common, you and I.

499
00:55:30,485 --> 00:55:33,901
We have nothing to lose.

500
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:45,405
<i>Was Lazar connected to Saco?</i>

501
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,620
<i>If he was, who had Buddha?</i>

502
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:54,797
<i>Eskimos have 500 words for snow,
the French have 500 kinds of cheese.</i>

503
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:58,882
<i>And all I have is 500 kinds of questions.</i>

504
00:55:58,972 --> 00:56:04,595
<i>I had to find my partner. I'd left him kissing a frog.</i>

505
00:56:04,686 --> 00:56:07,852
Jack!

506
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:16,151
Jack, are you okay?
- Take it easy.

507
00:56:17,782 --> 00:56:22,491
Say that again.
- Quoi? Are you okay?

508
00:56:23,996 --> 00:56:28,705
Let's fall in love.
- Let's get sober.

509
00:56:43,766 --> 00:56:48,890
Careful, Jack.
- What round is it?

510
00:56:48,979 --> 00:56:53,024
Fight's over, Jacko. You won.

511
00:56:57,029 --> 00:57:01,276
Who is the woman?
- Only you, baby.

512
00:57:04,494 --> 00:57:09,073
In the photo. With you and Pete and KC.

513
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:14,207
It's Jill.
- She is beautiful.

514
00:57:14,296 --> 00:57:20,915
Yeah, she was, she could have any man.
Lucky shrimp, she chose him.

515
00:57:24,556 --> 00:57:27,473
KC was a lot of fun back then.

516
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:32,137
The two of them together, they could light up a room.

517
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:35,017
They were a light you could steer by.

518
00:57:35,108 --> 00:57:39,271
What happened to KC's fun?

519
00:57:39,362 --> 00:57:44,071
She got sick and she died.

520
00:57:45,284 --> 00:57:50,824
It was slow and it was mean.
Took the skip right out of his step.

521
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:58,503
When was this?
- It's been ten years since I saw the man smile.

522
00:57:58,589 --> 00:58:02,456
All he's got left from her, is the dog.

523
00:58:10,059 --> 00:58:15,053
OK, here's the plan: We take the only
thing they care about. The movie.

524
00:58:15,147 --> 00:58:20,354
Oooh, the man has a plan. Welcome back, baby.

525
00:58:20,444 --> 00:58:25,272
<i>Does your pass key still work?
- Voilà.</i>

526
00:58:27,326 --> 00:58:33,660
<i>We needed a car to transport the negative
and we needed a way to get in the lab.</i>

527
00:58:33,749 --> 00:58:38,790
<i>Aram's day job would provide both. Everybody loves pizza.</i>

528
00:58:38,879 --> 00:58:42,330
<i>And Aram said Panda Pizza was the best.</i>

529
00:58:42,424 --> 00:58:46,504
Back off!

530
00:58:46,595 --> 00:58:50,378
We only have ten minutes.

531
00:58:54,811 --> 00:58:58,939
Panda Pizza, huh?

532
00:58:59,023 --> 00:59:01,810
Hello!
- Hello again, how are you?

533
00:59:01,901 --> 00:59:06,693
Just make it fast!
- I'm in the deep shit side.

534
00:59:06,781 --> 00:59:12,818
I need the big help.
- You're looking at the best big help there is in Hollywood.

535
00:59:24,964 --> 00:59:30,125
Slow down. It's good to see you.

536
00:59:31,387 --> 00:59:34,554
You're pretty in black. And a fun hat.

537
00:59:36,309 --> 00:59:40,307
No cameras. Get the negative and get out of here.

538
00:59:43,816 --> 00:59:47,896
What are we looking for KC?
- Something with Pete Smalls' name on it. And hurry up!

539
00:59:56,537 --> 01:00:01,282
What's going on between you and Saskia?
- Nothing.

540
01:00:01,375 --> 01:00:05,788
It doesn't look like nothing to me.
- Jack, you're my best friend.

541
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:09,249
Don't you think you'd know
if I was nibbling on Saskia's ear?

542
01:00:11,427 --> 01:00:14,214
Would you tell me if you nibbled on her ear?

543
01:00:14,305 --> 01:00:19,643
No. I said I'm not, okay?

544
01:00:23,021 --> 01:00:25,394
Shh, quiet!

545
01:00:30,153 --> 01:00:33,320
Wait!

546
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:38,484
I'm gonna help you in any way I can, sweetheart.
You just tell me what to do and poppa's gonna help.

547
01:00:38,578 --> 01:00:44,866
You didn't do anything wrong.
You just deleted a couple of credits.

548
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,464
Why did you say you were nibbling on her ear?

549
01:00:50,548 --> 01:00:55,175
For fuck's sake Jack.
Maybe I did say it, but I didn't do it.

550
01:00:55,261 --> 01:01:01,430
And if I were you, I'd be more concerned
about why Xan and Aram are being so quiet.

551
01:01:01,518 --> 01:01:03,973
Huh? Shit!

552
01:01:04,062 --> 01:01:07,478
Aram!

553
01:01:07,565 --> 01:01:10,732
What?
- Got ya, daddy!

554
01:01:10,818 --> 01:01:14,733
Credit screw-ups, they happen all the time.
- Do they?

555
01:01:14,822 --> 01:01:18,357
Well, not all the time, but daddy's gonna fix everything.

556
01:01:18,451 --> 01:01:24,785
As soon as Bob gets back from his break, we're gonna go
get some mango margaritas. My treat. Margaritas fix everything.

557
01:01:27,501 --> 01:01:33,705
Ever since this disaster my heart is jumping in my breast.

558
01:01:33,799 --> 01:01:38,675
In my bosom! Like I can't breathe.

559
01:01:40,973 --> 01:01:43,974
Can you feel it?
- Yeah, I can.

560
01:01:44,059 --> 01:01:50,477
Oh Sly, I feel so safe with you.
- Mango margarita!

561
01:01:50,566 --> 01:01:55,856
How do you say margarita in French?
- I must go.

562
01:02:11,336 --> 01:02:14,954
I like these suits! Look at him!

563
01:02:15,048 --> 01:02:19,674
You must leave that here.
- She's right dad. The first place they're gonna look is your apartment.

564
01:02:19,761 --> 01:02:23,711
Yeah Jack, let's go back to your place and wait it out.

565
01:02:23,807 --> 01:02:28,884
<i>Now that we had Pete's negatives Saskia
was happy, but Jack was freaked out of his mind.</i>

566
01:02:37,111 --> 01:02:41,061
What's taking them so long to find out?

567
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:53,120
What's your rush? I didn't think you'd be
itching to deal with fucker Lazar again.

568
01:03:04,388 --> 01:03:10,391
I want Jack Games' balls in my mouth!

569
01:03:11,937 --> 01:03:16,184
I gotta hide these fucking tapes.

570
01:03:17,985 --> 01:03:23,062
They're here! Give me that!

571
01:03:23,157 --> 01:03:25,992
Hey guys.

572
01:03:29,037 --> 01:03:32,122
I gotta hide those tapes.
- Any news?

573
01:03:32,207 --> 01:03:36,371
All it says is something about an insurance claim.
- They're not here!

574
01:03:36,461 --> 01:03:40,162
The tapes, they're gone! They've been here!
I knew they'd be here!

575
01:03:40,257 --> 01:03:44,634
Aram borrowed them, dad. You'll get them back.

576
01:03:46,429 --> 01:03:51,850
Oh my god, fucking Lazar is claiming lab negligence.

577
01:03:51,935 --> 01:03:55,932
And now the bond company is gonna
cover the cost of the negative.

578
01:03:57,607 --> 01:04:02,068
Don't do that. Where are you going? Hey! Wait up!

579
01:04:02,153 --> 01:04:06,365
I have something you want.
- She gotta be eighteen,

580
01:04:06,449 --> 01:04:10,826
...slightly boyish and willing.
- We've got the Smalls negative.

581
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:20,623
I wouldn't say that too loud if I were you. Somebody making
an outrageous claim like that might get a lot of attention.

582
01:04:20,712 --> 01:04:26,051
In a town where people have been known
to say anything for attention.

583
01:04:26,134 --> 01:04:29,752
Want some? It's really good.
- No thanks, I know how they make it.

584
01:04:29,846 --> 01:04:35,386
I want my dog.
- Your pooch still missing, is it?

585
01:04:35,477 --> 01:04:40,637
It seems hardly... fair.

586
01:04:40,732 --> 01:04:45,974
That I'll get my insurance money
and you're still without your dog.

587
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:49,439
Too bad he can't collect on a dog, like you can on a film.

588
01:04:49,532 --> 01:04:52,782
Shut up, you little twit. They can't get away with that.

589
01:04:52,869 --> 01:04:56,913
High-strung nacko succumbs to the pressure and

590
01:04:56,998 --> 01:05:01,494
edits in a big-money picture.

591
01:05:01,585 --> 01:05:05,453
We can her ass, she runs around
destroying everything in her path.

592
01:05:05,548 --> 01:05:09,545
That's the lab story and it just sounds right to me.

593
01:05:09,635 --> 01:05:13,467
Every time I think about that chick,
I gotta fucking take a walk around the block.

594
01:05:13,556 --> 01:05:17,505
You're going to blame Saskia
and collect on the insurance money.

595
01:05:17,601 --> 01:05:21,385
You better find that hot-headed Armenian chick
before the cops do.

596
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:24,766
I thought she was French.
- French, French-Armenian.

597
01:05:24,858 --> 01:05:28,310
<i>She was gone. Someone had
picked her place clean to the bone.</i>

598
01:05:28,403 --> 01:05:34,524
She had nice teeth for a dirty French girl,
you know what I mean? - Sure.

599
01:05:34,618 --> 01:05:38,912
She paid the rent on time,
which is unusual in this building.

600
01:05:38,997 --> 01:05:42,662
I have to eat too, right?
- Yeah, we all gotta eat.

601
01:05:42,751 --> 01:05:47,792
I wouldn't worry about me. I got a
dead husband, plenty of money.

602
01:05:49,424 --> 01:05:55,178
Some people find that attractive. Men and women.

603
01:05:55,263 --> 01:05:58,347
I have a lot of friends.

604
01:06:00,143 --> 01:06:05,647
She probably took off in the middle of the night.
Nobody heard so much as a peep.

605
01:06:05,732 --> 01:06:09,266
Must have had relations with hundreds of men.

606
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:15,363
You know. French, young, good teeth. You fill in the blanks.

607
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:19,150
What are you looking for in there?
I went through there already.

608
01:06:21,706 --> 01:06:27,292
I have a deposit check, but since you boys are relations

609
01:06:27,378 --> 01:06:30,913
you'll make account for the utilities?

610
01:06:31,007 --> 01:06:33,960
<i>Saco had packed up his operation and licked town.</i>

611
01:06:34,051 --> 01:06:37,550
<i>He had Buddha, maybe the film and Saskia too.</i>

612
01:06:37,638 --> 01:06:41,303
That is illegal, for your information.

613
01:06:41,392 --> 01:06:47,762
I like your suit, big guy. You know what I mean?
So, anyway, where do I send the bill?

614
01:06:47,856 --> 01:06:51,688
Someone scared the girl.
- Yeah. And you.

615
01:06:51,777 --> 01:06:54,944
Where did you first meet her?

616
01:06:55,030 --> 01:07:02,741
Saskia? Saco's garage.
Fat Joey. What was his name, before he became Fat Joey?

617
01:07:02,829 --> 01:07:07,787
Joey Saroyan. Before he became Fat Joey.

618
01:07:07,876 --> 01:07:10,414
Fat Armenian Joey?

619
01:07:10,504 --> 01:07:14,371
Right? Armenian?
- I don't know.

620
01:07:17,302 --> 01:07:23,257
<i>Fat Armenian Joey, who never left his room, gone.</i>

621
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:25,472
Damn.

622
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:34,148
Are you saying Pete got in trouble
with some Armenian secret society?

623
01:07:35,737 --> 01:07:37,979
Whatever that is.

624
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:53,545
They could be after us.
- Who's left?

625
01:07:57,091 --> 01:08:00,045
What are we gonna do?

626
01:08:04,765 --> 01:08:07,090
They fly to Mexico.

627
01:08:12,773 --> 01:08:15,525
Follow the butterflies.

628
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:28,989
Remember, I've got eyes on the back of my head.
- You must fall down a lot, dad.

629
01:08:29,081 --> 01:08:35,368
Aram, told you not to call me that.
How about a little land of separation here?

630
01:08:35,462 --> 01:08:40,005
What?
- Looks like the deal fell through.

631
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:45,008
Who said financing films is supposed to be easy?

632
01:08:49,809 --> 01:08:52,135
Come on! Let's go!

633
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:55,847
<i>Too bad about Len and Bernie. They were
the only people I knew who got arrested</i>

634
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:59,060
<i>attempting to break into Mexico.</i>

635
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:05,069
Where are you going?
- Suarez.

636
01:09:07,952 --> 01:09:10,324
Thank you.

637
01:09:41,192 --> 01:09:43,897
How long that kid's gotta know my daughter

638
01:09:43,987 --> 01:09:47,652
before he can watch her pee and I can't?

639
01:09:51,411 --> 01:09:54,495
Long enough to call you daddy.

640
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:59,538
Maybe if I get them some food,
they'll stop chewing on each other's faces.

641
01:09:59,627 --> 01:10:03,162
You'd better make it spicy.

642
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:09,253
<i>Muy picante. Gracias.</i>

643
01:10:09,345 --> 01:10:13,757
OK, there's only one real road south,
but I can't find Suarez anywhere.

644
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,514
Just keep looking.

645
01:10:32,534 --> 01:10:37,030
Do you like Mexican, Aram?
- I love it, Dad.

646
01:10:38,332 --> 01:10:42,080
What's this guy want?
- He says he knows where Suarez is.

647
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,636
I'm on fire.
- This guy smells.

648
01:11:47,149 --> 01:11:49,391
Wake him up.

649
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:10,958
<i>Jack still wanted to find the film,
but I'd long given up on that.</i>

650
01:12:11,048 --> 01:12:15,875
<i>I just wanted answers
and I hoped she was there to give them to me.</i>

651
01:12:25,937 --> 01:12:29,935
What do you think?
- We're somewhere.

652
01:12:30,025 --> 01:12:34,402
Maybe we should go and see
if they've got any rooms for tonight.

653
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:51,870
Do you speak English?
- Claro, sometimes.

654
01:12:51,963 --> 01:12:54,833
Do you know this place?

655
01:13:00,638 --> 01:13:03,555
Very well.

656
01:13:07,311 --> 01:13:10,561
Does this mean anything to you?
- Claro.

657
01:13:21,575 --> 01:13:26,818
You're Mr. Munk? I have rooms for you and your friends.

658
01:13:28,165 --> 01:13:32,993
Do they have cold beer?
- Are you Mr. Jack?

659
01:13:33,086 --> 01:13:37,131
And you Mr. Munk, I have someone for you to meet.

660
01:13:37,215 --> 01:13:40,419
Come, come.

661
01:13:47,267 --> 01:13:49,972
Hey, look!

662
01:13:53,815 --> 01:13:58,311
Buddha!
- Buddha, some name.

663
01:13:59,446 --> 01:14:02,446
Hey, hey...

664
01:14:06,578 --> 01:14:10,955
How did he get here?
- This man Saco, he bring him here.

665
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:16,580
And he paid me a lot of money,
and he say Mr. Munk will come for him.

666
01:14:16,671 --> 01:14:20,834
Saco, is he here?
- No.

667
01:14:20,925 --> 01:14:24,543
Is there a girl?
- No. No girl.

668
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:41,858
You eat, you drink, you sleep.
Tomorrow you wake up and you swim in the sea.

669
01:14:41,945 --> 01:14:45,314
And you feel fantastic.

670
01:14:47,659 --> 01:14:51,526
<i>Saco had got me my dog back and I was grateful.</i>

671
01:14:51,621 --> 01:14:56,283
<i>But why Mexico? To make a love movie?</i>

672
01:14:59,045 --> 01:15:04,585
Every man should know the love of a good dog
and the love of good tequila, mi amigo.

673
01:15:07,887 --> 01:15:10,045
<i>Salud!</i>

674
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:27,277
What's he saying?

675
01:15:27,364 --> 01:15:32,192
He say, this bad man made love to the dead man's wife.

676
01:15:32,286 --> 01:15:37,790
And he made the dead undead, maybe.
- That's tough.

677
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:40,745
Not for him.

678
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:58,014
<i>The minute that door opened and I smelled
that familiar cheap cologne, it all made sense.</i>

679
01:15:58,103 --> 01:16:03,856
<i>Pete called it his lucky scent.
It had always given me a headache.</i>

680
01:16:06,319 --> 01:16:12,238
I can't believe I made love to that woman for... what?

681
01:16:14,911 --> 01:16:17,912
Fourteen years!

682
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:30,044
So you're happy to see me alive then, are you?

683
01:16:31,093 --> 01:16:34,545
Your guys slapped me pretty good
over some money, skinny boy.

684
01:16:34,639 --> 01:16:39,715
Maybe you needed the slap to get you
out of the dirty laundry business.

685
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:47,141
See, I did the dysentery diet and I lost, what, 35 pounds.
It almost killed me, but man look at me now, I'm thin and beautiful.

686
01:16:47,234 --> 01:16:52,525
And I had to quit that fucking movie, I mean, it was...

687
01:16:52,615 --> 01:16:56,659
I should never have stolen that from you in the first place.

688
01:16:56,744 --> 01:17:03,197
God, I ruined it. I don't even know what it was called.

689
01:17:03,292 --> 01:17:05,865
What was it about again?
- Friendship.

690
01:17:05,961 --> 01:17:10,290
Fuck me, I knew it...

691
01:17:10,382 --> 01:17:15,091
I knew it. Friendship!

692
01:17:17,472 --> 01:17:20,224
Cheers, man. Friendship.

693
01:17:22,143 --> 01:17:27,730
That's what I need you for.
To remind me of all the shit I do.

694
01:17:27,816 --> 01:17:32,228
You have a gift, and it's not folding
other people's dirty fucking laundry.

695
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:37,694
You cooked this up so I could remind you of who you are?

696
01:17:37,784 --> 01:17:42,825
No, uncle Saco did the cooking
-most of the cooking. But yeah.

697
01:17:42,914 --> 01:17:48,999
In a nutshell, yeah.
- What about Jack?

698
01:17:49,087 --> 01:17:55,836
You should never have left him alone
in the Valley like that. He's delicate.

699
01:17:55,927 --> 01:18:01,466
He's not like you, he's not like me.
He's not. He's delicate.

700
01:18:01,557 --> 01:18:07,311
He's not going to make it out there on his own.
You know? All alone.

701
01:18:08,814 --> 01:18:11,021
- You saw him?

702
01:18:11,108 --> 01:18:13,860
Yeah, he kissed me.

703
01:18:16,655 --> 01:18:20,155
He's happy to be one of the three Stooges.

704
01:18:20,242 --> 01:18:26,327
He knows he's never gonna be fucking Moe or Curly.

705
01:18:26,415 --> 01:18:31,836
But he's just happy being Shemp.

706
01:18:33,589 --> 01:18:37,171
What about Saskia?
- She doesn't matter.

707
01:18:37,259 --> 01:18:43,878
I couldn't have done it without her, man. Fuck me, Saskia.

708
01:18:43,974 --> 01:18:46,547
No, fucking right. I couldn't have done it without her.

709
01:18:46,643 --> 01:18:51,352
What are you gonna do? 300-pound John Doe
rolls up on the fucking beach.

710
01:18:51,439 --> 01:18:56,232
I needed her to plant a suicide story.

711
01:18:56,319 --> 01:19:01,314
I had to kill that fucking movie. I mean, my God...

712
01:19:01,408 --> 01:19:06,034
She doesn't matter. You matter. It's me and you that matter.

713
01:19:06,121 --> 01:19:08,694
Forget about her.

714
01:19:13,753 --> 01:19:16,624
Surprise!

715
01:19:19,342 --> 01:19:22,047
I did everything for you!

716
01:19:23,554 --> 01:19:27,089
We are all together again, just like old times.

717
01:20:01,674 --> 01:20:04,960
Have you got my keys?

718
01:20:06,429 --> 01:20:09,963
Do you like it? Do you think it's too much?

719
01:20:11,183 --> 01:20:15,726
I think it might be a little tacky.

720
01:20:20,526 --> 01:20:23,776
I think someone stole my keys.

721
01:20:27,241 --> 01:20:29,696
Wait a minute.

722
01:20:32,871 --> 01:20:37,083
<i>So Pete had cooked this whole thing up
to destroy a film that embarrassed him</i>

723
01:20:37,167 --> 01:20:40,287
<i>and gotten Saskia and Joey to cover for him.</i>

724
01:20:40,379 --> 01:20:44,079
<i>I wonder how many other jams his
uncle Saco had gotten him out of...</i>

725
01:20:59,064 --> 01:21:03,061
KC, come on in the pool!

726
01:21:03,151 --> 01:21:08,062
Not now, Joey.
- You're not still sore at me, are you?

727
01:21:08,156 --> 01:21:11,489
No, I'm not sore.

728
01:21:13,745 --> 01:21:16,070
You saw Pete?
- Yeah.

729
01:21:16,164 --> 01:21:21,289
She wants to talk to you.
- We've got nothing to talk about.

730
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:24,995
Don't talk like that. I think you'll like her.

731
01:21:25,089 --> 01:21:29,965
Why would you think that?
- Because you're a stubborn fuck who doesn't know what's good for him.

732
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:34,719
Hello, ladies.
- Hey, Jack. Let's dance.

733
01:21:36,017 --> 01:21:39,468
Hey, you! You passed my stuff off to the news?

734
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:43,227
Don't be mad at him, dad.
- I'll get to you in a minute.

735
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:46,980
Did you? Good boy, son.

736
01:21:48,946 --> 01:21:54,652
<i>Pete always liked to make a big noise.
And this time, he'd outdone himself.</i>

737
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:59,037
<i>There was one person, other than myself,
who wasn't very impressed.</i>

738
01:21:59,123 --> 01:22:01,993
You mind if I sit?

739
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:04,409
As you like.

740
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:15,629
Why the sad face? Pete got what he wanted.

741
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:18,723
You should be celebrating.

742
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:26,185
Please KC, don't talk like this to me.

743
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:32,270
Pete was not my man. He never was.

744
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:36,527
See? You haven't forgotten how to lie to me.

745
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:41,612
Don't call me a liar.
- What should I call you?

746
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:46,659
Fuck you! Shut up!

747
01:23:08,524 --> 01:23:13,863
She threw a drink at you, yeah?
- Thanks for my dog.

748
01:23:16,824 --> 01:23:20,109
We are men, so we keep our word.

749
01:23:20,202 --> 01:23:26,620
Here's to you, Saco.
- Big deal. Here's to you, Munk.

750
01:23:30,337 --> 01:23:35,676
Now we make a love movie? Mine, yours?

751
01:23:37,010 --> 01:23:42,135
Why don't you make it with Pete?
- Pete's Basmanian.

752
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:49,093
We Basmanian men, we don't pick a man till we go maddened.

753
01:23:49,189 --> 01:23:54,349
It is the only way for us.
He's not mad. But I'm crazy. And I'm mad.

754
01:23:54,444 --> 01:23:58,857
And you have a madness in you too. Let me see.

755
01:23:58,949 --> 01:24:01,949
That's it! That's a good madness.

756
01:24:02,035 --> 01:24:06,198
<i>I guess being crazy made me Armenian in Saco's eyes.</i>

757
01:24:08,082 --> 01:24:12,127
<i>That night I drank like one, anyway.</i>

758
01:25:17,566 --> 01:25:21,813
So that's it? You're taking the cans of film?
- Go on, go on, go on!

759
01:25:21,904 --> 01:25:24,905
It's unbelievable, they want me back, KC.

760
01:25:24,990 --> 01:25:30,660
Fucking, the film is fucking up.
There's such a buzz about it now.

761
01:25:30,746 --> 01:25:36,202
With the dead film, and the dead person in there, you know?
- You know, you're still supposed to be dead.

762
01:25:36,293 --> 01:25:43,292
Yeah, I'm the director who never died.
I'm Elvis, but I've been sighted.

763
01:25:44,635 --> 01:25:50,637
What happened to that whole "script was a piece of shit"?

764
01:25:50,724 --> 01:25:54,508
Oh, yeah. No, because...

765
01:25:56,062 --> 01:26:00,226
We don't want the film to fall down. It's our baby.

766
01:26:05,363 --> 01:26:09,942
Learn fucking... Learn French, alright?

767
01:26:10,034 --> 01:26:14,613
Because...

768
01:26:14,706 --> 01:26:20,411
It's your words she fell in love with, right? Not mine!

769
01:26:26,926 --> 01:26:34,637
I mean, she's wrong, you know? She's French.

770
01:26:34,725 --> 01:26:40,146
<i>Pete looked propped up, holding on to his words.
Like, if he let the silence fall, it would never end.</i>

771
01:26:41,190 --> 01:26:46,433
<i>He looked lonely out there.
I think Pete loved us in his way.</i>

772
01:26:47,571 --> 01:26:52,648
<i>Despite all he had done, I loved him back.</i>

773
01:27:01,418 --> 01:27:03,790
Bye, Jacko!

774
01:27:12,012 --> 01:27:16,888
<i>Au revoir, mate!
- See you later, Pete!</i>

775
01:27:16,975 --> 01:27:20,973
<i>Auf Wiedersehen! Bye! French!</i>

776
01:27:22,105 --> 01:27:27,941
The man was never any good without you, KC.
- He has the negatives.

777
01:27:28,028 --> 01:27:34,232
Really? There ain't no film in them cans.
- What?

778
01:27:34,326 --> 01:27:40,578
You know, the funny thing about donkey shit and film,
it weighs just about exactly the same.

779
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:48,705
I heard him talking to some agent
last night in the lobby phone!

780
01:27:53,594 --> 01:27:56,679
He should have never called me Shemp.

781
01:27:56,764 --> 01:28:01,307
What's the matter with Shemp?
Shemp did some pretty good work.

782
01:28:03,229 --> 01:28:05,435
I guess.

783
01:28:07,316 --> 01:28:13,022
<i>You got the cans but you ain't got negatives in the cans</i>

784
01:28:17,952 --> 01:28:21,321
I found this at the bar.

785
01:28:25,584 --> 01:28:28,870
It's pretty, you should keep track of it.

786
01:28:28,962 --> 01:28:33,256
Saco, light them up! Watch this, baby!

787
01:34:17,136 --> 01:34:23,554
Smalls is dead.
- Dead. Deader than a dodo.
