SEVEN CHANCES

2
00:00:59,655 --> 00:01:03,755
One beautiful summer day,
when fragrant flowers were in bloom,

3
00:01:03,788 --> 00:01:07,453
Jimmie Shannon met Mary Jones,

4
00:01:07,454 --> 00:01:10,853
and he wanted to tell her
he loved her.

5
00:01:38,043 --> 00:01:42,943
When Autumn had cast its golden glow
and the flowers had faded and Died,

6
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:46,943
He still wanted to tell her
he loved her.

7
00:02:06,636 --> 00:02:10,936
When winter came and the leaves
had fallen one by one ...

8
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:14,034
... And the snow had covered the hills and valleys...

9
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:16,934
... He still wanted to tell her
he loved her.

10
00:02:37,928 --> 00:02:41,693
However... when nature had changed again,

11
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:45,726
Bringing forth spring-time with its
beautiful buds and blossoms...

12
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:50,725
... He still wanted to tell her
he loved her.

13
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:17,017
Jimmie was the junior partner of the
firm of "Meekin & Shannon",

14
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,715
Brokers, that had been tricked into a
financial deal that meant disgrace...

15
00:03:20,716 --> 00:03:24,516
... And possibly prison...

16
00:03:24,548 --> 00:03:27,713
Unless they raised money quickly.

17
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,310
A lawyer, unknown to the firm,
with good news for Jimmie.

18
00:03:46,807 --> 00:03:50,207
7-- And to my grandson, James Shannon,

19
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:53,205
I hereby bequeath the balance of
my estate amounting to...

20
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:10,501
"This man has some kind of
a legal paper with him !"

21
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:15,799
"Maybe it's a summons !"

22
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,096
"He's not in."

23
00:05:07,664 --> 00:05:10,884
"Let's go out to the
Country Club."

24
00:06:56,252 --> 00:07:01,652
And to my grandson, James Shannon, I hereby
bequeath the balance of my estate amounting to...

25
00:07:52,036 --> 00:07:56,036
"Your grandfather has left
you the sum of..."

26
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,828
"Seven million dollars."

27
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:31,125
"Providing..."

28
00:08:37,423 --> 00:08:44,023
"...you are married by seven o'clock on the
evening of your twenty seventh birthday."

29
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,220
"When is your twenty-seventh birthday ?"

30
00:08:56,218 --> 00:08:58,018
"Today !"

31
00:09:06,215 --> 00:09:09,280
"There's plenty of time..."

32
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,915
"You've got until seven o'clock
tonight to get married."

33
00:09:16,313 --> 00:09:19,213
"Maybe Mary might marry me."

34
00:10:23,593 --> 00:10:27,193
"Mary, you're the only
girl I have ever loved."

35
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:35,289
"Will you marry me ?"

36
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:11,379
"I must hurry back to the country club and..."

37
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,377
"...tell Billy it's all fixed..."

38
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:16,576
"...and we'll be married today."

39
00:11:19,376 --> 00:11:20,976
"Why today ?"

40
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:25,540
"My grandfather left me a lot of money..."

41
00:11:25,574 --> 00:11:28,734
"...providing I marry some girl today."

42
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:43,670
"I don't mean some girl... I can marry any girl !"

43
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:49,868
"I... I mean, it don't matter who I marry, but
I must wed someone !"

44
00:12:33,554 --> 00:12:37,554
"He said he must wed someone, and
it might as well be me !"

45
00:13:18,141 --> 00:13:24,341
"...and so you see, dear, how much better
it is to give him a chance to explain."

46
00:13:39,036 --> 00:13:43,136
"Then, Mr. Shannon, you've got
to marry some other girl."

47
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,733
"I couldn't marry any other girl."

48
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,030
"But, you'll lose this fortune."

49
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:08,528
"I don't want the money..."

50
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:12,527
"... it has already cost me
the only girl I ever loved."

51
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:33,121
