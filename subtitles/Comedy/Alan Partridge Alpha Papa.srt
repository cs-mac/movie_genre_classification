Do you want to know what this is all about?

3
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,540
You can say it's about drugs, or guns

4
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:11,438
disaffected youth or....

5
00:03:11,475 --> 00:03:13,294
Whatever you like...

6
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:16,221
But this whole thing is about parenting.

7
00:03:16,222 --> 00:03:18,465
It is about taking care of your children.

8
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:22,363
You take care of yours, I take care of mine.

9
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:25,227
I'm sorry I don't understand
What does that mean?

10
00:03:25,228 --> 00:03:29,126
That's all I have to say about that subject.
Next question?

11
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:32,867
Your son was a drug dealer?

12
00:03:32,868 --> 00:03:36,766
Drug dealer? No.
Did he sell a little weed? Yeah.

13
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:41,634
A little weed? He was a major supplier
in the San Gabriel valley.

14
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:43,627
I don't know anything about that.

15
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:47,497
What about the D. A. 's assertion that
your son got his marijuana from you...

16
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:49,577
and that you have tied to organized crime?

17
00:03:49,578 --> 00:03:52,276
What is this amateur night bullshit?

18
00:03:52,277 --> 00:03:55,234
That isn't an interrogation.  Alright?

19
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,257
I am a taxpayer and I'm a citizen.

20
00:03:58,258 --> 00:04:01,274
And you are a jerk-off.
Did I tell you that?

21
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:08,922
Come on Johnny, why don't I feed you behind

22
00:04:08,923 --> 00:04:12,010
if you're busting hard work I'm fucking your
Mom and your sister....

23
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:13,733
ahh Shit! What's that Tiko?
What did you say?

24
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:17,632
I heard you say you want to suck my cock right?

25
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:19,715
Primero would have to grow.

26
00:04:19,716 --> 00:04:22,544
Shit, mines got so big it's got a name

27
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:24,462
5 foot, 3 hung like a flea.

28
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:27,551
It's hot out there

29
00:04:27,552 --> 00:04:31,450
-What you doing, Elvis? Is it dark outside?
-What?

30
00:04:32,298 --> 00:04:34,195
I'm paying you for a full day right?

31
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:40,036
I've been here since 10 o'clock this morning.

32
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:42,181
I hate that shit.
I asked you a question.

33
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,197
D'you see the fucking moon, Elvis?

34
00:04:44,198 --> 00:04:48,095
-It's definitely daylight.
-Hey! I'll show you my moon.

35
00:04:48,098 --> 00:04:50,764
Johnny, I did everything that you say.

36
00:04:50,765 --> 00:04:54,663
The house is clean. I went to the store.
There is food and beer in the fridge.

37
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:58,596
The wash is done. Adolf's fed.
The grass is cut.  It is all done, man.

38
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:02,563
Well, I guess you shouldn't finish so fast huh?.

39
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:04,581
Shut the fuck up!

40
00:05:04,582 --> 00:05:06,565
-Hey, never mind that!
-Never mind that!

41
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:08,482
Get back to fucking work!

42
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:12,380
You want something to do. .
Go wash the floors, scrub out the toilets. .

43
00:05:12,384 --> 00:05:16,156
or better yet pick up all the dog shit
that's in the back yard.

44
00:05:16,157 --> 00:05:18,269
And if you finish too fast...

45
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,999
-dump it out and...
-Pick it back up again

46
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,088
-Shut the fuck up, bitch!

47
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:27,891
-Get you a pooper-scooper
-Touchy

48
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:30,688
-It's messed up, man.
-What?

49
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:34,586
When am I going to get my money, Elvis?
When?

50
00:05:34,622 --> 00:05:36,670
I get my cheque on Thursday

51
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:38,491
Well, how much is the cheque?

52
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:40,441
I don't know. It depends on the hours.

53
00:05:40,442 --> 00:05:42,457
Well, how many hours did you work, bitch?

54
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,441
I can't remember.

55
00:05:44,442 --> 00:05:45,545
Fucking dead beat, man.

56
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:48,276
Go on! Get the fuck outta here!

57
00:05:48,277 --> 00:05:51,366
The walk of shame...
The walk of shame, man.

58
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:53,381
-Robby?
-Hold up, bitch!

59
00:06:01,022 --> 00:06:02,841
$8, 500

60
00:06:02,842 --> 00:06:05,052
All of this, huh?

61
00:06:05,053 --> 00:06:08,951
Surprise! Surprise!

62
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,001
-Yeah
-Okay

63
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,669
So?

64
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,651
So. . I've got this guy

65
00:06:15,652 --> 00:06:19,549
He wants 5, plus my regular 2.

66
00:06:20,561 --> 00:06:24,364
So, I figure I'm gonna need 7.

67
00:06:24,365 --> 00:06:26,348
I don't know.

68
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:28,395
I don't like having that much shit out

69
00:06:28,396 --> 00:06:32,294
I'll see my guy Monday and
I'll clear you right out, man.

70
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,538
He's good for it, Johnny

71
00:06:37,142 --> 00:06:38,800
You don't need to tell him
I'm good for it, man.

72
00:06:40,403 --> 00:06:43,361
I'm not looking for any fucking favours, JT

73
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:46,189
If it makes sense. Do it!

74
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,087
If no, fuck it.

75
00:06:55,034 --> 00:06:56,983
Alright

76
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:59,910
We'll try it.

77
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:02,525
-Where you going, Ray?
-That's what I'm talking about

78
00:07:05,795 --> 00:07:08,622
But come Friday....

79
00:07:08,623 --> 00:07:10,520
I don't want to hear any fucking stories.

80
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,880
You won't.

81
00:07:16,006 --> 00:07:17,857
Be ready, be ready.

82
00:07:28,588 --> 00:07:32,485
Nice. Nice.
Its big league stuff right there, baby.

83
00:07:32,554 --> 00:07:36,452
I will throw you a couple.

84
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,306
-Hey!
-Hey.

85
00:07:41,707 --> 00:07:44,298
-What you say, Tarzan?
-I need 7.

86
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,191
-7? 7 to who?
-Bobby 911.

87
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:52,117
-That could be put together.
and when you're picked off.
-Alright

88
00:07:54,109 --> 00:07:58,007
-Knows where he's been?
-Yeah... I know. . it feels good.

89
00:08:02,855 --> 00:08:04,674
Alright.  It's on you anyway, right?

90
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:08,511
Always is, pop.

91
00:08:08,512 --> 00:08:11,410
Look at this kid, how handsome he is.
Look at this!

92
00:08:11,414 --> 00:08:13,565
You must be knocking them dead.
Are you knowing them dead?

93
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:15,681
No. Let go!

94
00:08:15,682 --> 00:08:18,574
What you doing tonight?
Chasing tail?

95
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:20,623
No. I'm just chilling.

96
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:22,639
On Friday. night?

97
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,531
-Sonny?
-I know.

98
00:08:25,532 --> 00:08:29,430
You make me wonder about you, kid.
You sound like half a fucking fag.

99
00:08:29,434 --> 00:08:31,553
-I always had my suspicions.
-Just make the fucking call!

100
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,700
Wait a minute, ok?
Remember what I told you...

101
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:38,498
Men are not supposed to be 'monopulous'
It's in our nature to spread the seed.

102
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:41,396
Yeah, very poetic. Come on

103
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:46,107
Angela is a nice girl but you
gotta plough some fucking fields.

-I like your hair, Jakie.
-Thank you.

110
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:57,678
-You look handsome with a little hair
-Thank you.

111
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,384
-How is going on with the job?
-I had a lot of sales.

112
00:11:01,385 --> 00:11:05,253
Busy, everything's going really... great

113
00:11:05,254 --> 00:11:06,456
How is your mother?

114
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,252
Wonderful. Thank you.

115
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,170
-Tell her I said hello
-And Wanda?

116
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:14,023
She's fine and err...
could I talk to you for a second. . ?

117
00:11:15,982 --> 00:11:19,104
Yeah.  Sure.

118
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:21,001
Excuse us.

119
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,276
I need to borrow money.

120
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:39,079
-I thought we'd talked about this.
-Yeah.

121
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,030
You haven't paid me back for the last time.

122
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:42,300
I know.  I'm sorry.

123
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,772
It's not the money,
you know that don't you, son?

124
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:49,446
I just can't keep bailing you
out all the time.

125
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:51,656
I know. Do you...

126
00:11:51,657 --> 00:11:55,554
You think I would fucking be here is
this wasn't the last stop on earth?

127
00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:02,133
How much?

128
00:12:02,134 --> 00:12:06,032
$800.

129
00:12:07,953 --> 00:12:10,131
-What is going on?
-Dec wants to borrow money.

130
00:12:10,132 --> 00:12:12,894
How many times are we going to do this, Bud
The kid comes in here, stoned out of his mind

131
00:12:12,895 --> 00:12:16,120
and you keep throwing money at him because
you don't want to deal with it.

132
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:19,269
I'm working.

133
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,065
I have a job
I'll pay you back.

134
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:24,992
No. No, I can't do it, son.

135
00:12:24,993 --> 00:12:27,500
Right. Sorry. Go back to
your perfect little family.

136
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:32,314
-That that's not fair.
-Don't touch me

137
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:45,938
Hey. Can I come with you?

138
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:49,837
No, kid.  Not tonight.
I've got some shit to do.

139
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:55,627
Are you ok?
Are you alright?

140
00:12:55,628 --> 00:12:57,545
Yeah.

141
00:12:57,546 --> 00:12:58,380
Okay. Well, page me later.

142
00:12:58,814 --> 00:13:01,740
-Yeah. Yeah
-OK

143
00:13:01,741 --> 00:13:05,638
-I love you.
-Yeah.

144
00:13:13,128 --> 00:13:14,025
Punk ass bitches

145
00:13:21,972 --> 00:13:24,116
Look at those fucking stupid fucks

146
00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:27,855
With their fucking guns and
their fucking gold chains.

147
00:13:27,856 --> 00:13:30,911
-They're nothing-Worthless
-Shit

148
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:35,590
The only thing those mother fuckers
are shooting are music videos, dog.

149
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:37,641
-That's what I am saying
-The same thing

150
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:41,540
-That's what I am saying, dog
-That's what I am talking about

151
00:13:43,527 --> 00:13:47,424
-Now I am feeling it.
-Now you're feeling it?

152
00:13:48,338 --> 00:13:52,235
-Now I am feeling it.
-No Shit!

153
00:13:53,117 --> 00:13:57,015
-Don't want that shit. No

154
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:01,901
Dance! Dance!

155
00:14:10,457 --> 00:14:13,382
You wanna call me out?!
You wanna call me out?!

156
00:14:13,383 --> 00:14:15,364
-OK. I'll call you out
-Shit

Come on, Elvis. Come here.

163
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,674
You can't dance, bitch!

164
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:46,572
Come here.

165
00:14:58,248 --> 00:15:02,018
Give me a fucking beer.

166
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:04,066
Will ya get a beer?

167
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:06,212

168
00:15:06,213 --> 00:15:08,200
Don't worry, Angie.
I got it. I got it.

169
00:15:08,954 --> 00:15:10,124

170
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,855
-Run, bitch!
-I'm thirsty

171
00:15:12,856 --> 00:15:16,753
<i>Look at that slave-ass mother-fucker
"I got it, Johnny"</i>

172
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,740
He's like a spook, man.

173
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:20,755
<i>You loves Johnny</i>

174
00:15:20,756 --> 00:15:23,713
He does.  Don't you, Elvis?

175
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,730
Mother-fucker!

176
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:29,628
Johnny, yeah I loves him a lot.

177
00:15:31,485 --> 00:15:33,565
I owe him a lot.

178
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,352
I do.

179
00:15:35,353 --> 00:15:37,433
No, no, no, no.
I don't mean like that.

180
00:15:37,434 --> 00:15:41,140
<i>I mean you fucking looooove him.</i>

181
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,375
-You'd fucking do anything for him.

182
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:46,590
If he asked you to sucks his cock,
you probably would.

183
00:15:48,544 --> 00:15:49,713
Shut the fuck up.

184
00:15:49,714 --> 00:15:52,541
No, no, no.
Tell the truth, Elvis!

185
00:15:52,542 --> 00:15:57,375
Tell me you wouldn't drop to your fucking
knees and suck Johnny's cock in two
seconds if he asked?

186
00:15:57,484 --> 00:16:01,222
You give it a kiss on the tip....

187
00:16:01,223 --> 00:16:04,083
-No, I wouldn't.
-You wouldn't?

188
00:16:04,084 --> 00:16:05,285
-Johnny? Come on.
-Ahh, you see that?

189
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:12,015
Full on, dick in the mouth, balls across
the nose, dildo up the ass...

190
00:16:12,016 --> 00:16:13,024
You're a faggot!

191
00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:15,916
100 percent

192
00:16:15,917 --> 00:16:19,841
Don't talk to me anymore, ok?
I fuck bitches.  You're a homo.

193
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:21,768
Don't!.  That's it.

194
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:24,695
Shut the fuck up!

195
00:16:24,696 --> 00:16:26,613
-Suck my fucking cock!

196
00:16:26,614 --> 00:16:29,474
I'm dead serious.

197
00:16:29,475 --> 00:16:31,588
Suck it, bitch.

198
00:16:31,996 --> 00:16:33,113
-Suck my fucking cock!
-The fucking door!

199
00:16:33,507 --> 00:16:34,456
I got it.

200
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:35,906
Come on do it!

201
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:39,355
-I got it, alright?
-Suck my cock!

202
00:16:40,314 --> 00:16:42,394
Pretty soon it is gonna come out, Elvis.

203
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:46,293
-You're gonna come out, Elvis.
-That you're fucking gay.

204
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,181
What's up, Jake?

205
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:51,041
Try calling a mother-fucker before
you just show up, ok?

206
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:53,091
You Jews just don't have no respect.

207
00:16:53,092 --> 00:16:56,017
Can I speak to you for a minute?

208
00:16:56,018 --> 00:16:58,812
Yes, it is Friday.
Let's go in here.

209
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:00,748
So, what's going on homie?

210
00:17:01,364 --> 00:17:04,354
You know that thing I told you I was going
to take care of for you down in San Diego?

211
00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:07,214
-Yeah
-It's a wash out

212
00:17:07,215 --> 00:17:09,066
Really? What Happened?

213
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:11,214
Well.  I go down there and put the screws on him
and tell him something bad is gonna happen to him unless

214
00:17:11,215 --> 00:17:15,205
he comes up with your money
and like . .  FAST...

215
00:17:15,961 --> 00:17:18,074
Which he doesn't because he is fucking tacked.

216
00:17:18,075 --> 00:17:21,972
But he is scared so he rings round his neighbour and
I'm walking the guy for a hundred and fifty bubs

217
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,746
So?

218
00:17:25,747 --> 00:17:28,867
So, the bubs are no good
The X was fucking punk.

219
00:17:28,868 --> 00:17:32,792
And I had a line to take it all, man. We would
have made so much money on that shit.

220
00:17:33,615 --> 00:17:37,512
But you said that you would take care of it.
You said it was your debt.

221
00:17:37,548 --> 00:17:39,467
-Are ya coming here trying to nigger talk me?
-Now, what could I do.

222
00:17:39,468 --> 00:17:42,458
I couldn't exactly go back to the guy I
ripped off and say 'you're shit was no good'.

223
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:44,472
Okay, but I still gotta get paid.

224
00:17:44,473 --> 00:17:49,085
No.  Come the fuck down.
I got $800 here and I thought...

225
00:17:50,131 --> 00:17:52,990
-that we could split it
-You thought we could split it?

226
00:17:52,991 --> 00:17:56,113
Fuck that. You pay me!
All of it.

227
00:17:56,113 --> 00:17:57,152
-I'm trying.
-How?

228
00:17:57,153 --> 00:17:59,851

00:17:59,852 --> 00:18:01,965
-Be careful Johnny. I'm not fucking Elvis.

00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:05,832
Watch you're fucking mouth ya little fucking bitch

232
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:50,633
Get this fucking bitch off.

Shut up!

252
00:19:59,688 --> 00:20:01,586
What's going on?

253
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,434
-Who's there?
-It's Zack.

254
00:20:08,435 --> 00:20:12,332
-Who? It's fucking midnight.
-It's me, Zack.

255
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,520

256
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:19,419

00:20:26,056 --> 00:20:27,953
Heil, sir.

259
00:20:35,873 --> 00:20:39,771
-Do you want a drink?
-Yeah.

260
00:20:42,603 --> 00:20:46,501
...and she is always telling
me what to do

261
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:50,373
...like, what clothes to wear and what girls
she thinks are pretty...

262
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,518
Like, I couldn't fucking figure
it out for myself.

263
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:55,218
That's you're Mom.
It's Olivia.

264
00:20:55,219 --> 00:20:58,241
Come on.  She loves you
You're her baby.

265
00:20:58,242 --> 00:21:00,255
Yeah. I know.

266
00:21:00,256 --> 00:21:03,247
It's embarrassing

267
00:21:03,248 --> 00:21:06,141
Do you know that we have
"home work parties"?

268
00:21:06,142 --> 00:21:10,040
-What?
-Homework parties with little hats.

269
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:12,503

...for birthdays

270
00:21:14,454 --> 00:21:16,373
Yeah.

271
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:18,111
Another thing...

272
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,200
I was sleeping, right...

273
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:25,911
...and she'll wake me up
by looking at me.

274
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,999
Like, I open my eyes and she'll be right there
looking at me, like...

275
00:21:32,504 --> 00:21:34,356
Fucking 'A'

276
00:21:34,357 --> 00:21:38,255
It's god damn creepy you know.
Like she is in love with me
and breathing on me

277
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:39,273
You're lucky, you know that?

278
00:21:40,274 --> 00:21:43,171
I mean, my Ma she never...

279
00:21:47,037 --> 00:21:49,084
...boohoo of me.

280
00:21:49,085 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah, I know.

281
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:51,999
But...

282
00:21:52,954 --> 00:21:54,878
I would trade you.

283
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:56,869
I gotta get out.

284
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:02,768
I gotta smoke.

285
00:22:03,552 --> 00:22:05,534
Well...

286
00:22:05,535 --> 00:22:08,494
...look at the boy Zackie, all grown up.

287
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:12,392
Is that one header or stress weed?

288
00:22:13,371 --> 00:22:17,269
Shut up.

289
00:22:26,017 --> 00:22:29,915
Take a drink!

290
00:22:31,903 --> 00:22:35,800
Like a pro.

291
00:22:57,163 --> 00:23:00,219
One minute.

292
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,079
-It is Olivia.
-No, no fucking...

293
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,977
Alright...

294
00:23:13,906 --> 00:23:17,775
Yeah he's here.

295
00:23:17,776 --> 00:23:19,570
No, we're talking.

296
00:23:20,571 --> 00:23:21,489
I said we are talking.

297
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,387
Don't get you're panties all in a waddle
I'll drive him home later.

298
00:23:27,334 --> 00:23:31,232
Yes, I do know what time it is.
Thank you.

299
00:23:31,233 --> 00:23:31,233

300
00:23:33,218 --> 00:23:35,396
Yeah, okay

301
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:38,289
Okay.  Alright!

302
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:42,187
You've gotta get home.

303
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,855
-No.
-Wait, stop.

304
00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:49,600
Tonight, we ride.

305
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:53,567
Shit.

306
00:23:55,489 --> 00:23:56,000
Let's go.

307
00:23:56,994 --> 00:23:58,880
Jake... hey, Jake.

308
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:01,805
-Am I fine?
-Yes sir

309
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:03,983
-Am I fine?
-You're the best.

310
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,706
-Yeah?
-hmmm.

311
00:24:05,707 --> 00:24:07,592
No, you're the best.

312
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:15,493
You wanted him.
You got him.

313
00:24:15,494 --> 00:24:17,443
Bye.

314
00:24:17,444 --> 00:24:21,342
You're a real son of a bitch, you know that?

315
00:24:22,386 --> 00:24:26,283
Let's go.

316
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,858
I was fucking my dog, and...

317
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:43,875
No, no, listen.

318
00:24:44,876 --> 00:24:46,400
Look at the ass of that one

319
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,450
I could crack it open like a peach.

320
00:24:51,205 --> 00:24:52,090
You fucking kidding me?

321
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,613
You are a fucking dinosaur , Cosmos.

322
00:24:55,614 --> 00:24:59,512
Come on! You're dead.
You can't do anything.

323
00:25:00,394 --> 00:25:02,539
Ya balls are all wrinkled up.

324
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,230
What?

325
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,441
What? You deaf fucker
I said you're old.

326
00:25:06,442 --> 00:25:09,334
I'd knocked the bottom outta her.

327
00:25:09,335 --> 00:25:13,231
You don't even know where the bottom is.
You don't know what to do.

328
00:25:14,017 --> 00:25:15,219
Hey, waitress.

329
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,117
-What can I do for you?
-What have you got in mind?

330
00:25:21,006 --> 00:25:22,826
Just get another round of drinks.

331
00:25:22,827 --> 00:25:25,654
-You haven't finished the last one.
-I didn't ask you that.

332
00:25:25,655 --> 00:25:28,645
-Just get us some more fucking drinks.
-Get us some drinks, bitch

333
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,407
I pay. Hey, I got it.

334
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:38,464
-You got it hey?
-Yeah

335
00:25:38,465 --> 00:25:42,362
It's a special occasion

336
00:25:45,227 --> 00:25:49,095
-Come on, Cosmos, let's go.
-Come on!

337
00:25:49,096 --> 00:25:52,994
Johnny, watch yourself.

338
00:25:53,973 --> 00:25:57,870
-Say Jake that we stopped by.
-Oh! I will.

339
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:09,509
When I told Jake what happened he fucking
flipped out and I had to calm him down.

340
00:26:09,643 --> 00:26:12,665
He's gonna kill Johnny. Jake's like that.
He is a very passionate person.

341
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:17,477
But I told him: if you're gonna do something
you've gotta fucking hit him where it hurts.

342
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:21,216
Johnny had a class storm
I mean two of the quantities

343
00:26:21,217 --> 00:26:23,322
...he was trying to collect on
the insurance money...

344
00:26:25,248 --> 00:26:28,109
Jake comes in. Salts the whole fucking deal.

345
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:31,133
Sharon's company catches wind of it

346
00:26:31,134 --> 00:26:33,050
They don't pay out.

347
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:35,943
Cost Johnny 30, 000 dollars.

348
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:38,870
'cause Johnny had to retaliate...
It's fucking business.

349
00:26:38,871 --> 00:26:41,706
Mr. Johansson wants to see you.

350
00:26:42,707 --> 00:26:44,730
Want to see me?

351
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:47,628
Sit down!

352
00:26:53,533 --> 00:26:55,418
What's up Pete?

353
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:57,336
You're probation officer called.

354
00:26:57,337 --> 00:27:00,393
Mr. Lampington?
It thought he was out of town.

355
00:27:00,394 --> 00:27:03,319
Yeah, well I talked to him.

356
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,048
He said you've been getting
into trouble again.

357
00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:08,975
Breaking into houses. .
Using drugs... speed mainly.

358
00:27:08,976 --> 00:27:09,113
It's not true.

359
00:27:09,114 --> 00:27:11,563
-Yeah, it is.
-No, it's not.

360
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:13,860
Pete, I swear to God.

361
00:27:14,861 --> 00:27:18,901
Dude. Dude!
It's.... .

362
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,450
I feel you.
I'm right here...

363
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:25,089
Don't look at me that way.
I'm telling you the fucking truth.

364
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,169
I'm totally fucking straight, man.

365
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:29,056
I mean I'm a litt...
Mr. Lampingtons' so full of shit...

366
00:27:29,057 --> 00:27:32,954
He's outta fucking town
How would he know what I am doing?

367
00:27:34,972 --> 00:27:36,891
You disappoint me.

368
00:27:36,892 --> 00:27:40,789
Pete.

369
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,774
-Pete, I swear to fucking God
-Need you to take a drugs test.

370
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,522
Pete, come on...

371
00:27:47,523 --> 00:27:49,504
I need the job.

372
00:27:49,505 --> 00:27:52,301
-I really need this job.
-Fill it up.

373
00:27:52,302 --> 00:27:55,324
I need this fucking job.

374
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:56,429
Fuck you!

375
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:59,389
-Fuck off!
-No.

376
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:02,152
Get the fuck outta here.

377
00:28:02,153 --> 00:28:05,923
You're fired
Get out!

378
00:28:05,924 --> 00:28:08,069
Don't come back in here.

379
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,987
Get the fuck outta here.

380
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:13,791
I will take a gun to your fucking head.

381
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:16,689
I will take you to hell with me.

382
00:28:26,028 --> 00:28:28,075
Do you want to play some (?), Truelove?

383
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:31,974
Let's play some fucking games.

384
00:28:41,601 --> 00:28:45,625
You called my PO (probation officer)
You called Mr. Lampington?

385
00:28:48,636 --> 00:28:52,534
Mother-fucker!

00:29:00,308 --> 00:29:04,205

388
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,967
-Check the bathroom.

389
00:29:11,882 --> 00:29:12,999
Jake.

390
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:16,982
Truelove.

391
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,868
-Shit, look at his fucking TV.
-Fuck the TV

392

<i>The neighbourhood is safe again</i>

00:30:36,672 --> 00:30:37,873
Ohh. What the fuck, dude?

-Moving?
-God damn right!

404
00:30:42,556 --> 00:30:45,050
Too many assholes know where I live.

Did ya see this?

406

Holy Shit.

407
00:30:52,622 --> 00:30:55,515
Johnny, what happened, man?

408
00:30:55,516 --> 00:30:59,414
Came home last night...
My windows busted and my TV's missing

409
00:30:59,698 --> 00:31:01,679
-Fuck, right?

00:31:03,663 --> 00:31:03,663
Crac

Fucking crack head Mazursky took a

427
00:31:51,455 --> 00:31:54,348

There aren't even any fucking lights on.

00:33:12,246 --> 00:33:16,143
How can the lights be on?
It's the middle of the fucking day

447
00:33:19,008 --> 00:33:20,146
What the fuck are we doing?

448

449
00:33:35,654 --> 00:33:37,669
-What are you doing?
-I'm kidding.

450
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,594
Well stop fucking around.

Manny Ramirez, mother-fucker

456
00:33:57,852 --> 00:34:00,000
You guys are fucking idiots.

457

Ooh, Jesus! Make more noise!

458
00:34:12,305 --> 00:34:15,067
He's 15. Remember when you were 15?

459
00:34:15,068 --> 00:34:18,025
For once in your life,
your tennis match will wait.

460
00:34:18,026 --> 00:34:21,924
Why do you have to be such a fucking
pussy? What are you thinking?

461
00:34:21,928 --> 00:34:24,722
-What are you getting crazy about?
-I am not crazy...

462
00:34:24,723 --> 00:34:26,746
If you were ever here, you
might notice that.

463
00:34:26,747 --> 00:34:29,770
Great! Let's just let him turn
out like the other...

464
00:34:29,771 --> 00:34:33,770
Like what, Olivia.  Like Who?
Say it! Like Jake?

465
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:37,512
Hey.  What's going on?

466
00:34:41,016 --> 00:34:44,902
Come here.

467
00:34:51,746 --> 00:34:54,508
Your Mother found this in your room.

468
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:54,998
It's a pipe

469
00:34:54,999 --> 00:34:57,047
I know what it is. It's a bone.
Want to tell me about it?

470
00:34:57,048 --> 00:34:58,770
-No
-You smoking pot?

471
00:34:58,771 --> 00:35:00,753
-No
-Now look at me, we have to talk.

472
00:35:00,754 --> 00:35:02,898
-I don't want to fucking talk.
-We that's too bad.  Sit down!

473
00:35:02,899 --> 00:35:05,630
Dad! I just fucking woke up.

474
00:35:05,631 --> 00:35:08,621
God Damn! Wait 'till I put
some fucking clothes on.

475
00:35:08,622 --> 00:35:11,677
God! Fucking dick!

476
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:26,340
Yes, we should punish him.
Do something for God's sake.

477
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:29,981
You never do anything.

478
00:35:29,982 --> 00:35:32,159
Zack come down here!

479
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,458
Zack.

480
00:35:58,934 --> 00:36:01,540
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-What?
-That's his brother.

481
00:36:01,557 --> 00:36:02,613
Pull over!

482
00:36:04,614 --> 00:36:07,376
Hey, what's up?
Come here!

483
00:36:07,377 --> 00:36:09,359
Come here, fuck-face.

484
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,183
What the fuck are you running for?

485
00:36:16,285 --> 00:36:18,049
Come on, let's go.

486
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:22,169
What the fuck you want?
I didn't do anything.

487
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:26,067
Shut the fuck up and get in, Bitch.

488
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:44,355
Fucking idiot.

489
00:36:49,252 --> 00:36:51,364
Just take him to your place.

490
00:36:51,365 --> 00:36:54,258
I can't take him to my place.
My Dad's there.

491
00:36:54,259 --> 00:36:56,208
I thought you said he was cool?

492
00:36:56,209 --> 00:36:59,167
Bitch, he is cool, but you didn't
tell me we would be bringing
along a fucking hostage.

493
00:36:59,168 --> 00:37:01,832
He is not a hostage, alright?

494
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:04,076
I told you I don't know what I
am doing right now, alright?

495
00:37:04,077 --> 00:37:06,974
-I'm thinking.
-Well, think!

496
00:37:08,889 --> 00:37:11,787
Hey, we've got to take him some place.

497
00:37:14,773 --> 00:37:17,666
Alright.  I know somewhere we can go.

498
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:19,584
But you have got to be fucking cool.

499
00:37:31,213 --> 00:37:33,033
What is there?

500
00:37:33,034 --> 00:37:36,025
-Hey, what's up, man?
-Chucky

501
00:37:36,026 --> 00:37:38,820
-A lot of dudes, bro.
-I know that.

502
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:42,719
Bring 'em in.

503
00:37:42,854 --> 00:37:44,770
Hey, Chuck.  This is Truelove;
the guy I was telling you about.

504
00:37:44,771 --> 00:37:46,300
Hey, what's up, man?

505
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:48,880
Do you have a room we can use?

506
00:37:48,881 --> 00:37:50,700
-A room?
-Yeah

507
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:53,756
Yeah, I've got one down to the left.

508
00:37:53,757 --> 00:37:56,655
Thanks

509
00:38:05,331 --> 00:38:07,346
So, what's up, man?

510
00:38:07,347 --> 00:38:09,231
We're just chilling, man.

511
00:38:09,232 --> 00:38:13,130
-Getting high, getting ready to go to fiesta.
-Smoking weed.

512
00:38:13,134 --> 00:38:14,600
Thanks, man.

513
00:38:18,043 --> 00:38:19,500
So, how you been?

514
00:38:19,661 --> 00:38:23,558
Been good. Chilling, ripping
waves, hanging out.

515
00:38:27,594 --> 00:38:29,550
What the fuck is going on back there?

516
00:38:30,024 --> 00:38:31,032
Do you want me to go check it out?

517
00:38:31,162 --> 00:38:35,060
Yeah, I mean, 4 dudes I have never
met are in my fucking bedroom.

518
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,596
Give me the tape!

519
00:38:45,597 --> 00:38:47,630
What the fuck are you doing, man?

520
00:38:50,572 --> 00:38:54,440
Are you nuts, you can't do that.
You guys are out of your fucking mind.

521
00:38:54,441 --> 00:38:55,991
-What the hell is this?
Who the fuck are you?
-Shut up

522
00:38:55,992 --> 00:38:58,136
Hey Chucky, they got a kid tied
up in your room.

523
00:38:58,137 --> 00:39:00,021
-Calm down
-He's a kid

524
00:39:00,022 --> 00:39:02,981
-Johnny is just a little crazy right now.
-A little crazy right now?

525
00:39:02,982 --> 00:39:05,939
We stole this kid...

526
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,857
I thought I told you to shut your mouth?

527
00:39:07,858 --> 00:39:09,840
And you: Mind your fucking business.

528
00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:12,669
Mind my business?
This is my fucking house.

529
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:16,567
Frankie, you better put your boy in check.
Tell him what fucking time it is.

530
00:39:16,636 --> 00:39:19,464
-Like that huh?
-Just like that, bitch.

531
00:39:19,465 --> 00:39:22,357
I get it. Hey, Lump...
Let's get out of here.

532
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:24,340
I'm going to fucking fiesta...

533
00:39:24,341 --> 00:39:28,239
when I get back, none of you
Mother-fucker better be here.

534
00:39:29,153 --> 00:39:32,013
-Let's get out of here girls.
-Let's go!

535
00:39:32,014 --> 00:39:33,911
Fucking shit-head.

536
00:39:36,858 --> 00:39:39,756
Chucky, man... I'm really sorry
about all this, bro.

537
00:39:52,593 --> 00:39:55,519
What's going on?
Why aren't you guys ready.

538
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,535
What are we going to do with the kid, man?

539
00:39:57,536 --> 00:39:59,257
Who cares.

540
00:39:59,258 --> 00:40:03,316
Leave him in the fucking closet.
Pick him up then. I don't give a fuck.

541
00:40:05,273 --> 00:40:08,166
Johnny, I have a date back in the valley.

542
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:11,027
I have to get back, man.

543
00:40:11,028 --> 00:40:12,197
Me too.

544
00:40:12,198 --> 00:40:14,896
You've just remembered now, huh?

545
00:40:14,897 --> 00:40:16,098
-Yeah
-Yeah, man.

546
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:18,960
My girl gets mad if I don't fuck her.

547
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:22,858
You pussies wanna go home?
Fine! Take the fucking van.

548
00:40:23,641 --> 00:40:25,722
Listen! You don't have to do that.

549
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:28,615
You can put me in a fucking closet.
I'm not going to run anyway.

550
00:40:28,616 --> 00:40:32,386
Do me a favour: Shut up, before I
shut you the fuck up.

551
00:40:32,387 --> 00:40:36,285
Why is this mother-fucker talking anyway?
I thought we taped him up?

552
00:40:36,354 --> 00:40:40,252
He couldn't breathe.

553
00:40:41,998 --> 00:40:44,956
Just drop me off on the strip.
I'm going to fucking fiesta.

554
00:40:44,957 --> 00:40:47,100
I'm not going to let this little
mother-fucker spoil my weekend.

555
00:40:48,494 --> 00:40:51,418
-What about me?
-No

556
00:40:51,419 --> 00:40:53,466
-No, what?
-He stays with you.

557
00:40:53,467 --> 00:40:56,458
-What?
-I said fucking queer as a deaf mother-fucker

558
00:40:56,459 --> 00:40:58,474
-Why me, dude?
-Because I fucking said so.

559
00:40:58,475 --> 00:41:00,424
Don't fuck around man.

560
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:03,123
I can't fucking take him to my
Dad's house like that.

561
00:41:03,124 --> 00:41:06,016
Well then, untie him, genius!
You heard the kid...

562
00:41:06,017 --> 00:41:07,251
-You aren't running are you?
-What?

563
00:41:07,252 --> 00:41:09,071
No.

564
00:41:09,072 --> 00:41:14,320
Go home, tell Juergen that he's your new little
butt buddy and he is spending the night.

565
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:16,100
Meanwhile, I'll talk to Mazursky.

566
00:41:19,264 --> 00:41:21,561
He must be going crazy, right now.

567
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,106
Hey, what's going on?

568
00:41:28,107 --> 00:41:31,064
It's a mad house.

569
00:41:31,065 --> 00:41:33,000
Your brother is scaring the shit
out of all of us.

570
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:34,546
Did they call the friends?

571
00:41:34,547 --> 00:41:37,244
Maybe he has a girl?

572
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:41,143
We tried everything. Friends,
cops, hospitals... nothing. .

573
00:41:41,244 --> 00:41:44,234
Don't you think the kid is out
just fucking around?

574
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:47,192
I mean you can't keep the kid
locked in the house forever

575
00:41:47,193 --> 00:41:50,184
Maybe, I don't know.

576
00:41:51,085 --> 00:41:53,034
We did have an argument this morning.

577
00:41:53,035 --> 00:41:55,050
OK, well that's what it is then, right?

578
00:41:55,234 --> 00:41:56,371
I hope so.

579
00:41:56,372 --> 00:41:59,135
-Well, what do you think?
-I don't know.

580
00:41:59,135 --> 00:42:01,247
But...

581
00:42:01,248 --> 00:42:05,146
We can't rule anything out.

582
00:42:07,068 --> 00:42:10,966
I'll have to ask you a few questions, ok?

583
00:42:13,733 --> 00:42:15,650
Do you know anyone who
would want to hurt Zack?

584
00:42:15,651 --> 00:42:18,739
-No.
-You?

585
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:22,509
-Me what?
-You've a beef with anyone
I oughta know about?

586
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,600
That person you owe money to?

587
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,861
You owe somebody money?

588
00:42:25,862 --> 00:42:29,759
Jesus! Just tell me how much and
I will write the cheque.

589
00:42:29,861 --> 00:42:32,753
-It is not really like that, Olivia.
-Really? What's it like?

590
00:42:32,754 --> 00:42:36,652
Tell me what it's like, god damn you!

591
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:39,483
Fuck. Bring him back.
Please relax.

592
00:42:39,484 --> 00:42:43,382
Bring him back!

593
00:42:43,483 --> 00:42:47,380
Back here!

594
00:42:47,416 --> 00:42:50,439
I am going to find him.
I promise you.

595
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,308
I promise.

596
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:58,207
I will find him.

597
00:42:59,154 --> 00:43:00,650
Where are you going?

598
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:08,950
Where's Johnny?

599
00:43:09,202 --> 00:43:11,185
Don't know Dog, is he here?

600
00:43:11,186 --> 00:43:14,273
<i>-That is what I am asking you dog
-Excuse me. We were talking.</i>

601
00:43:14,274 --> 00:43:17,980
Klemash, where the fucking kid?
I ain't seen him, dude.

602
00:43:17,981 --> 00:43:20,500
What the fuck is that?. . Behind your back
when you turn away from me?

603
00:43:20,774 --> 00:43:22,725
-What's the problem here?
-Shut your big ass

604
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:23,894
Don't touch her!

605
00:43:23,895 --> 00:43:27,793
Asshole!

606
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:58,809
If anybody sees...
Johnny Truelove...

607
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:03,828
Tell him that Jake Mazursky
is looking for him.

608
00:44:05,718 --> 00:44:07,615
Thank you.

609
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,791
Back the fuck off me, man?
I am informing you.

610
00:44:30,792 --> 00:44:33,690
-I want a beer. Do you want one?
-Yeah, sure.

611
00:45:00,228 --> 00:45:03,097
Here you go.

612
00:45:04,098 --> 00:45:06,210
-Cigarette?
-No. I don't smoke.

613
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:10,109
Fuck that! It's good for you.

614
00:45:25,653 --> 00:45:28,708
Hey, man...

615
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:31,634
...what if I said; you could walk
over there right now...

616
00:45:31,635 --> 00:45:35,437
...jump on a bus, catch a ride home...

617
00:45:35,438 --> 00:45:38,461
I turned my back and tell Truelove...

618
00:45:38,462 --> 00:45:41,355
...you fucking ran away or something...

619
00:45:41,355 --> 00:45:45,252
What do you think about that?

620
00:45:51,221 --> 00:45:53,138
I don't know, Frankie.  I mean...

621
00:45:53,139 --> 00:45:56,195
I don't wan to cause any problems
for my brother, you know?

622
00:45:56,196 --> 00:46:00,093
So I think; I'm just going to ride it out.
See what happens

623
00:46:00,974 --> 00:46:03,836
Alright?

624
00:46:03,837 --> 00:46:04,940
Alright.

625
00:46:04,941 --> 00:46:08,839
Right.

626
00:46:26,843 --> 00:46:27,741
Dad.

627
00:46:30,605 --> 00:46:34,503
Frankie?

628
00:46:35,514 --> 00:46:37,464
Good to see you, boy...

629
00:46:37,465 --> 00:46:40,163
-My little son loves his dad.
-Don't.

630
00:46:45,462 --> 00:46:49,360
Let's go to bed.

631
00:46:50,177 --> 00:46:54,074
I love you.

632
00:47:08,506 --> 00:47:11,496
-I want you to meet...
-Alright

633
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:14,292
-Hi.
-Hi.

634
00:47:14,293 --> 00:47:17,153
Give the kid a kiss
Dad!

635
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:24,014
Dad, No...
Leave me be.

636
00:47:24,015 --> 00:47:26,094
Come on, smoke with your old man.

637
00:47:26,095 --> 00:47:27,817
-Have a drink?
-No

638
00:47:27,818 --> 00:47:29,768
Something?
No. Come on.

639
00:47:29,769 --> 00:47:32,726
Who is your little friend?
Are you babysitting?

640
00:47:32,727 --> 00:47:33,595
Fuck you.

641
00:47:36,596 --> 00:47:38,643
Use the sofa.

642
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,543
Wake up.

643
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,500
Come on you've got chores to do.
Let us go!

644
00:48:11,992 --> 00:48:14,085
-Hello
-I fucking hear you

645
00:48:14,473 --> 00:48:17,464
There's coffee but Bessy got up late so
I need you to straighten up the house.

646
00:48:17,465 --> 00:48:19,480
I'm supposed to clean up after your party?

647
00:48:19,481 --> 00:48:22,503
I know I moan like a bitch.
Don't argue with me. I am in no mood.

648
00:48:22,504 --> 00:48:26,177
Look, I came home yesterday and
your shit is all over the house.

649
00:48:26,178 --> 00:48:29,233
We had a deal remember?
Get a job, pay rent...

650
00:48:29,234 --> 00:48:31,281
Alright! Fuck!
Get out of my room!

651
00:48:31,282 --> 00:48:33,617
Nice fucking mouth.

652
00:48:35,118 --> 00:48:37,880
Fucking dick.

653
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:41,779
Hey. Don't worry about it.
I'll help you with the work.

654
00:48:41,978 --> 00:48:45,716
Juergen is botanical. He grows
everything we eat right here.

655
00:48:45,717 --> 00:48:48,675
Tomato, cucumbers, corn.

656
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:51,503
Fucking spices and shit.

657
00:48:51,504 --> 00:48:54,526
Fucker is a full blown alcoholic,
smokes like a chimney...

658
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:58,425
...but, Goddamn, if we don't eat healthy.

659
00:48:59,502 --> 00:49:01,483
Look at this shit right here.

660
00:49:01,484 --> 00:49:04,183
Daddy's pride and joy.

661
00:49:04,184 --> 00:49:08,081
Cause the greedy bastard will smoke 'em
all but it's Frankie's job to take care of them.

662
00:49:08,247 --> 00:49:12,051
Water them, throw some egg shells
on them every now and then.

663
00:49:12,052 --> 00:49:13,156
Well fuck it

664
00:49:13,157 --> 00:49:17,054
Let's get to work.

665
00:49:29,059 --> 00:49:31,957
Shit. I'll be right back.

666
00:49:38,065 --> 00:49:40,828
-Hey Girl!
-What's going on?
-Nothing. Working.

667
00:49:40,829 --> 00:49:42,844
Are you guys coming over?
You got that shit?

668
00:49:42,845 --> 00:49:44,762
You know I do.

669
00:49:44,763 --> 00:49:45,867
Mom.  I'm going to Frankie's.

670
00:49:45,868 --> 00:49:48,631
-Did you talk to him?
-It's all good.

671
00:49:48,632 --> 00:49:52,402
-When will you be home?
-I don't know. Late probably.

672
00:49:52,403 --> 00:49:56,494
Darling, can you stay with Julie
and Sabrina tonight? It's your father
and my anniversary

673
00:49:57,344 --> 00:49:59,294
Anniversary!

674
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:02,156
-You gonna have a little sex or some...?
-That's disgusting.

675
00:50:02,157 --> 00:50:04,106
Whatever! I'm interested.

676
00:50:04,107 --> 00:50:07,259
I mean, really, are you going to go down on him?

677
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:10,023
-Give him a little tube stick boogie?
-No!

678
00:50:10,024 --> 00:50:12,169
Oh come on! Live a little.

679
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:14,899
You guys have been married what. .
...500 years?

680
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,005
Keith Straten! I will knock the
shit out of you, you little skunk!

681
00:50:18,867 --> 00:50:20,817
OK We're leaving.

682
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:24,716
Get your keys? Lets go get
Sabrina and Julie.

683
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,070
Yo! Youngblood.  Come here, man.

684
00:50:48,225 --> 00:50:50,142
Ladies...

685
00:50:50,143 --> 00:50:52,937
Dick Wad, Fuckweed

686
00:50:52,938 --> 00:50:53,946
Susan.
Hi.

687
00:50:53,947 --> 00:50:56,710
Sabrina, Julie,

688
00:50:56,711 --> 00:50:59,700
Dick Wad

689
00:50:59,701 --> 00:51:01,781
OK.  OK, let's go smoke some
fucking weed, man!

690
00:51:01,782 --> 00:51:04,512
But, hey, listen.
No-one messes up my shit, alright?

691
00:51:04,513 --> 00:51:08,410
This house ain't never been
so fucking clean

692
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:16,313
You fucking blow this game.

693
00:51:16,314 --> 00:51:18,427
I don't fucking blow. You just died, man.

694
00:51:18,428 --> 00:51:22,325
-I thought I was the other guy.
-That's me.

695
00:51:24,117 --> 00:51:26,099
I thought I was playing the other dude.

696
00:51:39,723 --> 00:51:43,526
-Suck my balls!
-Fuck you. Suck my balls, man

697
00:51:43,527 --> 00:51:45,425
You suck it bitch.

698
00:51:47,526 --> 00:51:49,410
So, how old are you?

699
00:51:49,411 --> 00:51:51,096
How old do I look?

700
00:51:51,697 --> 00:51:52,979
About 12.

701
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,178
Well, I am 17, but I do look really young.

702
00:51:57,214 --> 00:52:01,111
I am going to kill your ass, kill your ass.

703
00:52:01,115 --> 00:52:03,400
-Stop the game.
-No! Go answer your phone.

704
00:52:03,872 --> 00:52:05,756
Suck it!
Suck it!

705
00:52:05,757 --> 00:52:07,641
Fuck you

706
00:52:07,642 --> 00:52:09,626
Yo Johnny! What's up?
Did you talk to anybody?

707
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:11,445
<i>-Not yet, why?</i>

708
00:52:11,446 --> 00:52:13,461
Look, man, I can't keep the
kid here much longer.

709
00:52:13,462 --> 00:52:16,356
<i>-Why? What up?
-Nothing, just having some people over.</i>

710
00:52:16,357 --> 00:52:18,370
<i>-Who?
-Nobody. Shut up</i>

711
00:52:18,371 --> 00:52:20,321
Nobody, just some people.

712
00:52:20,322 --> 00:52:23,246
Chill Out, dog!

713
00:52:23,247 --> 00:52:26,076
<i>-Get them the fuck out of there. </i>

714
00:52:26,077 --> 00:52:27,974
Alright, alright, I'll clear it up.

715
00:52:31,083 --> 00:52:32,610
I need you to do a favour for me, bro.

716
00:52:33,345 --> 00:52:37,241
Johnny is coming and I need the house.
Will you watch the kid for me for a little while?

717
00:52:37,311 --> 00:52:39,098
Watch him?
Keep an eye on him, no phones...

718
00:52:39,099 --> 00:52:40,998
...and no leaving him alone.

719
00:52:41,225 --> 00:52:43,304
No phones?

720
00:52:43,505 --> 00:52:45,586
I don't get it.

721
00:52:46,537 --> 00:52:50,434
Alright, look, if I tell you something
can you keep your fucking mouth shut?

722
00:52:51,185 --> 00:52:54,176
Yeah, 'course, man.
Yeah.

723
00:52:54,177 --> 00:52:57,199
The kids brother owes Truelove money...

724
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,098
...and Johnny's holding him like a
marker or something until he gets paid

725
00:53:05,399 --> 00:53:06,500
That's fucked up.

726
00:53:07,054 --> 00:53:08,685
No, no, Bitch. It's not like that.

727
00:53:09,032 --> 00:53:11,372
The kid knows what's happening
and he's cool with it.

728
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:15,185
I mean, look at the mother-fucker.
He ain't going no where.

729
00:53:15,967 --> 00:53:20,024
Just take him some place, hang out,
bring him back in a couple of hours.

730
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,917
Can you do that for me?

731
00:53:22,917 --> 00:53:26,850
I don't know, man. I'm...

732
00:53:26,852 --> 00:53:29,917
Sounds pretty fucking dubious.

733
00:53:29,917 --> 00:53:30,899
Keith...

734
00:53:31,433 --> 00:53:34,401
...who the fuck are you talking to, man?

735
00:53:34,401 --> 00:53:38,397
If I tell you something is good
then that's what it is.

736
00:53:38,435 --> 00:53:42,431
Are you going to take care of this for me?
Or not?

737
00:53:42,502 --> 00:53:44,500
Susan, I swear to God,
It's cool. Trust me.

738
00:53:44,502 --> 00:53:46,368
-Hey fuck you. Let go of me
-Calm down!

739
00:53:46,368 --> 00:53:48,300
You're not supposed to know any of this.

740
00:53:48,302 --> 00:53:50,370
Jesus, don't say anything.
You are going to get me
in a lot of fucking trouble.

741
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:53,568
From who, Keith?
From your little gangster friends?

742
00:53:53,568 --> 00:53:55,625
-Oh! I'm really scared.
-You fucking should be.

743
00:53:56,034 --> 00:53:58,102
You are a little fucking faggot,
you know that?

744
00:53:58,102 --> 00:53:59,580
Whoa guys. What's going on?

745
00:53:59,802 --> 00:54:01,935
-This kid has been kidnapped
-No, he hasn't.

746
00:54:01,935 --> 00:54:05,931
You mean like 'abducted' kidnapped?
Fucking stolen! Ask him.

747
00:54:07,735 --> 00:54:11,733
Yeah, yeah they took me but...
It's ok.

748
00:54:11,935 --> 00:54:15,933
-They took you why?
-His scumbag brother owes
Johnny Truelove money

749
00:54:16,304 --> 00:54:18,469
-Shut up!
-Wooah! Fucking hot.

750
00:54:18,471 --> 00:54:21,203
Dude, so you're ransom or something.

751
00:54:21,203 --> 00:54:22,070
Yeah.

752
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:25,070
Stolen boy.

753
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:29,366
-You don't look stolen.
-Yeah.

754
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:33,211
Dude, I want you to know that you
can do anything you want, ok?

755
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:34,125
I don't play that shit
Shit!

756
00:54:34,336 --> 00:54:37,336
-If you wan to fucking leave, go for it.
-Shut the fuck up, you fucking bitch!

757
00:54:40,304 --> 00:54:42,336
Hey guys! Whoah!

758
00:54:42,338 --> 00:54:43,370
-Fuck
-Susan

759
00:54:43,371 --> 00:54:45,370
Hey! Hey!

760
00:54:45,371 --> 00:54:48,270
-I'm gonna knock you fucking face off
-Hey fucking chill out!

761
00:54:48,272 --> 00:54:50,338
My God. . My brother...

762
00:54:50,338 --> 00:54:54,171
-My brother is going to pay the money, ok?
-See!

763
00:54:54,171 --> 00:54:57,171
So, like, in the mean time your on vacation?

764
00:54:57,171 --> 00:54:58,760
-Yeah, yeah why not...
-Fucking awesome!

765
00:54:59,221 --> 00:55:01,399
...like another story to tell my grandkids

766
00:55:01,788 --> 00:55:03,054
That's so fucking cool.

767
00:55:03,056 --> 00:55:06,822
Dude, this shirt is fucking cool,
Bob Marley is cool...

768
00:55:06,822 --> 00:55:08,887
You guys think that kidnapping is cool?

769
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:12,981
Yes, Susan, it is fucking exciting!
I think it is romantic that he is
doing this for his brother.

770
00:55:13,889 --> 00:55:16,923
-Are you insane?
-Susan, chill out!

771
00:55:16,923 --> 00:55:19,022
This is fucking wrong.

772
00:55:19,022 --> 00:55:19,022
Crac

773
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:21,479
Doesn't anyone else think
this is fucking wrong?

774
00:55:22,689 --> 00:55:25,756
-No
-Susan, take a fucking valium!

775
00:55:25,757 --> 00:55:28,788
-OK? It isn't any of your business.
-He is in my house!

776
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:29,889
Oh Jesus!

777
00:55:29,889 --> 00:55:31,870
Calm the fuck down.

778
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:36,413
I am going to roll us the biggest
fucking joint anyone has ever seen.
You guys ok with that?

779
00:55:37,223 --> 00:55:38,719
-Absolutely

780
00:56:01,002 --> 00:56:02,929
Hey! What's up you black-dick faggot?

781
00:56:03,802 --> 00:56:05,901
You're looking short, bitch.

782
00:56:05,901 --> 00:56:08,080
Make yourself busy, baby.
Gotta talk some business.

783
00:56:09,901 --> 00:56:11,800
-Can I get you guys a drink?
-Pina colada?

784
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:15,252
This ain't a bar, baby.
There's no fucking pina colada.

785
00:56:15,253 --> 00:56:19,247
-Not even in little cans?
-No, but I have got wine I can
make you a spritzer

786
00:56:24,987 --> 00:56:26,985
Sit down!

787
00:56:26,985 --> 00:56:29,084
What's the fucking deal?

788
00:56:29,086 --> 00:56:30,985
I don't know what to do.

789
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:34,018
-What do you mean?
-About the kid.

790
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,151
We could be in a lot of trouble.

791
00:56:36,153 --> 00:56:38,052
-Trouble?
-Yeah.

792
00:56:38,054 --> 00:56:40,253
Big ass, serious as shit, trouble

793
00:56:40,254 --> 00:56:44,187
I mean, you can't just take a
kid and have no one notice.
boy without being noticed.

794
00:56:44,187 --> 00:56:46,860
That's what I told you?
Didn't I say that?

795
00:56:47,221 --> 00:56:48,165
-You did, alright...
-Fuck

796
00:56:48,721 --> 00:56:50,552
-But still...

797
00:56:50,554 --> 00:56:53,852
...We are were we are.
Right here, you know?

798
00:56:53,854 --> 00:56:57,850
It's a big problem and we have to fix it.

799
00:56:58,822 --> 00:57:01,788
So, what do we do?
I don't know.

800
00:57:01,788 --> 00:57:05,784
There is an answer, a solution, to this
but I am just not seeing it.

801
00:57:06,921 --> 00:57:09,921
I don't know, maybe we are fucked.

802
00:57:09,921 --> 00:57:11,955
We are not fucked.

803
00:57:11,955 --> 00:57:14,780
-What do you mean 'fucked'?
-Jail 'fucked', mother fucker.

804
00:57:15,538 --> 00:57:18,671
If we let the kid go, he runs back to
Mummy and Daddy and rats us out.

805
00:57:18,671 --> 00:57:20,871
Not to mention 'Tattoee'.  Who knows what
that crazy mother-fucker is going to do...

806
00:57:20,872 --> 00:57:20,872
Crac

807
00:57:20,872 --> 00:57:24,867
We are going to be looking
over our fucking shoulders.

808
00:57:24,937 --> 00:57:27,723
I don't think the kid will spill.
I really don't.

809
00:57:28,306 --> 00:57:29,802
Yeah, but what if he does?

810
00:57:33,205 --> 00:57:36,010
-Fuck that shit.
-See what I am saying?

811
00:57:36,427 --> 00:57:38,147
I am not fucking going to prison!

812
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:39,149
I just wont!

813
00:57:39,606 --> 00:57:41,471
Me neither, bitch, what the fuck do
you think I am talking....

814
00:57:41,506 --> 00:57:42,871
I'm not fucking kidding, John.

815
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,330
This is really fucking bad.

816
00:57:44,824 --> 00:57:49,463
The best for us to do is get a hold of 'Tattoee' and
straighten him and this shit out once and for all.

817
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:50,669
Well,  where is that mother fucker?

818
00:57:50,957 --> 00:57:54,723
Who the fuck knows!?! I don't know,
he is probably laying low looking to
shot me in the fucking head. .

819
00:57:54,725 --> 00:57:56,856
Think about it! That's what I would be doing.

820
00:57:56,856 --> 00:58:00,854
Stop! Already, alright.
You know how I get with this anxiety shit.

821
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,298
I swear to God, man,
I am hyperventilating.

822
00:58:23,201 --> 00:58:24,253
I want to ask you something...

823
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:27,534
What? Fuck!

824
00:58:27,536 --> 00:58:29,435
Hypothetically, alright?
This isn't real right?

825
00:58:29,435 --> 00:58:32,534
We are just talking here....

826
00:58:32,536 --> 00:58:33,500
But...

827
00:58:35,502 --> 00:58:39,594
...what would say if I offered you
$2, 500 dollars just to kill the kid?

828
00:58:42,536 --> 00:58:43,602
Kill him?

829
00:58:43,602 --> 00:58:46,098
Yeah, fucking wax him.

830
00:58:50,137 --> 00:58:53,070
Are you fucking insane?

831
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:55,925
I am not going to fucking kill the kid.
That's a fucking joke right?

832
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:59,199
Of course it's a fucking joke, man.
You're so fucking stupid

833
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:02,163
-You're an asshole, man.
-Okay, man, I was just playing.

834
00:59:02,165 --> 00:59:03,336
Well, stop fucking around.

835
00:59:03,667 --> 00:59:07,661
Look man, can't we just grease the kid?

836
00:59:07,699 --> 00:59:10,933
Tell him he can hang out anytime.
That he's our boy.

837
00:59:10,933 --> 00:59:13,832
Throw a fucking arm around him or something.

838
00:59:13,834 --> 00:59:16,731
Give him a few bucks?
Right!

839
00:59:16,733 --> 00:59:20,729
Tell him to say, when Mummy and Daddy ask,
that he ran away with some girl or something.

840
00:59:22,701 --> 00:59:25,800
-Yeah, Maybe, yeah
-We have to get the story straight, but
we can make it work, man.

841
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:29,667
We just grease the kid
and then it's taken care of.

842
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:32,663
Then we are not running around here
like a bunch of fucking chinamen

843
00:59:33,834 --> 00:59:35,701
Done.

844
00:59:35,703 --> 00:59:37,733
See, that's what I love about you, man...

845
00:59:37,734 --> 00:59:39,699
...you're smarter than me.

846
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Whoa.  Let me see that?
Come here!

847
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
-Does it hurt?
-No

848
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:50,701
I can talk to you alone for a minute?

849
01:01:05,268 --> 01:01:09,266
I just wanted to say sorry
about all this shit.

850
01:01:09,302 --> 01:01:13,669
I know it's a big pain in the ass. This
whole thing is really fucking ridiculous.

851
01:01:14,734 --> 01:01:15,429
Yeah.

852
01:01:16,102 --> 01:01:18,034
Are you ok?

853
01:01:18,034 --> 01:01:22,002
Is everyone treating you alright?
You got enough to eat?

854
01:01:22,003 --> 01:01:23,068
-Yeah
-Yeah?

855
01:01:23,068 --> 01:01:25,405
Need anything?
Need some dough?

856
01:01:26,302 --> 01:01:27,534
No, I am good.

857
01:01:27,534 --> 01:01:31,403
-Are you sure...?
-No, I'm really good.  Really.

858
01:01:31,403 --> 01:01:34,334
I know that is hard but...

859
01:01:34,336 --> 01:01:37,435
...it's all going to get squared away soon.
I promise.

860
01:01:37,435 --> 01:01:39,433
Okay, cool.

861
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:43,469
Alright.

862
01:01:43,471 --> 01:01:47,467
I gotta jet but I...

863
01:01:48,338 --> 01:01:51,534
...you know something...?
you're....

864
01:01:52,386 --> 01:01:53,649
You're a pretty stand up guy.

865
01:01:54,687 --> 01:01:56,886
-Thanks.
-Your brother's a dickhead

866
01:01:56,887 --> 01:02:00,753
He's my boy, and I love him but
he's just...

867
01:02:00,754 --> 01:02:03,687
...you know, he's acting a
mother fuck right now, you know?

868
01:02:03,687 --> 01:02:04,820
Yeah, I know.

869
01:02:06,822 --> 01:02:09,687
Yeah, well.... .

870
01:02:09,687 --> 01:02:13,620
...anyway's... tomorrow...

871
01:02:13,621 --> 01:02:15,616
This will all be over by tomorrow.

872
01:02:50,621 --> 01:02:53,855
Hi baby, what's up? I thought you
were spending the night out?

873
01:02:53,856 --> 01:02:56,588
Yeah, I was.  I just...

874
01:02:56,590 --> 01:02:58,656
I really needed to talk.

875
01:02:58,657 --> 01:03:00,122
Talk?

876
01:03:00,723 --> 01:03:02,157
What now?

877
01:03:02,758 --> 01:03:03,250
Kind of.

878
01:03:04,207 --> 01:03:07,340
One night.  I ask for one night out of
the whole fucking year to make love...

879
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:09,407
...to your father and you won't
even give that to me.

880
01:03:09,407 --> 01:03:12,288
I'm 'X'ing right now. I can't understand
anything you're saying.

881
01:03:12,308 --> 01:03:13,574
-Sorry! Mom?
-Fuck

882
01:03:16,407 --> 01:03:20,308
He was wearing a brown shirt, a blue
sweatshirt, brown tennis shoes

883
01:03:20,308 --> 01:03:23,042
...and his grandfather ring with a red stone.

884
01:03:24,141 --> 01:03:26,141
You got a phone call.

885
01:03:26,141 --> 01:03:27,899
I'll take it upstairs.

886
01:03:29,441 --> 01:03:30,939
Excuse me.

887
01:03:43,342 --> 01:03:45,475
<i>Yo! It's me. </i>

888
01:03:45,475 --> 01:03:46,250
<i>"Midget"</i>

889
01:03:48,143 --> 01:03:51,241
You go some set of balls calling me here.

890
01:03:51,242 --> 01:03:53,031
<i>What's the matter? You don't answer
a mother fucking page?</i>

891
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:55,909
<i>-We got nothing to talk about?
-Oh, I think we do, don't you?</i>

892
01:03:56,644 --> 01:03:58,572
<i>Straighten out all this shit, once and for all. </i>

893
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:00,975
There is nothing to straighten out,
mother-fucker, I know it was you.

894
01:04:00,976 --> 01:04:02,875
<i>I don't know what you're talking about. </i>

895
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:05,042
Johnny, I know.

896
01:04:05,044 --> 01:04:07,943
I know!

897
01:04:07,943 --> 01:04:09,342
And you're dead.

898
01:04:09,343 --> 01:04:12,074
<i>-Don't threaten me. 
-Fuck that, it's a promise.</i>

899
01:04:12,076 --> 01:04:17,008
No matter where you go,
No matter what you do,
I am going to hunt you down.

900
01:04:17,110 --> 01:04:19,510
I am going to hunt you down
then I am going to slit your throat.

901
01:04:20,078 --> 01:04:24,074
Then I am going to cut you open, then
I am going to eat your mother fucking heart.

902
01:04:24,112 --> 01:04:27,439
You better pray, Johnny,
you better fucking pray...

903
01:04:27,441 --> 01:04:30,241
...that the cops find you before I do.

904
01:04:30,378 --> 01:04:34,435
Get on your cock sucking knees and pray!

905
01:04:46,379 --> 01:04:48,344
...Johnny Truelove on 2

906
01:04:50,346 --> 01:04:52,477
Hey "cock and balls" what can I do for you?

907
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:53,370
Question for you:

908
01:04:54,012 --> 01:04:58,008
Let's say that someone I know owes
someone money and won't pay.

909
01:04:58,012 --> 01:05:00,245
So, that someone I know...

910
01:05:00,246 --> 01:05:04,143
... has his boys snatch the dead-beats kid
brother until he does pay...

911
01:05:04,145 --> 01:05:05,943
<i>What kind of problems is he looking at?</i>

912
01:05:05,945 --> 01:05:06,542
Big Ones.

913
01:05:07,014 --> 01:05:10,014
<i>If he has an arrest he is looking at life. </i>

914
01:05:13,014 --> 01:05:15,014
<i>Are you there cock?</i>

915
01:05:16,015 --> 01:05:20,010
<i>-Life?
Life, yeah</i>

916
01:05:20,147 --> 01:05:22,179
So what does he do?

917
01:05:22,179 --> 01:05:23,820
<i>I don't know</i>

918
01:05:25,281 --> 01:05:27,346
<i>He probably digs a deep hole...</i>

919
01:05:27,347 --> 01:05:29,842
<i>Why? What's the matter?
Who's in trouble?</i>

920
01:05:32,347 --> 01:05:33,854
What the hell is he still doing here?

921
01:05:34,082 --> 01:05:35,568
You have to chill the fuck out, Susan.

922
01:05:36,031 --> 01:05:40,028
The way you keep running your fucking mouth,
Truelove could go to jail and we could wind up dead.

923
01:05:40,066 --> 01:05:43,997
Fuck you, you don't know.
The mother fucker's crazy.

924
01:05:43,999 --> 01:05:48,159
Yesterday he offered me $2, 500
to kill the kid.

925
01:05:50,167 --> 01:05:52,097
What?
Yeah, right.

926
01:05:52,098 --> 01:05:53,465
Kill him.

927
01:05:54,165 --> 01:05:56,098
Oh Jesus

928
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:58,230
First you give me fucking mouth and
now you give me fucking tears?

929
01:05:58,231 --> 01:06:02,032
Do me a favour Susan,
have a period or something.

930
01:06:02,032 --> 01:06:04,165
Of course I am not going to do it...

931
01:06:04,167 --> 01:06:07,098
I told him.  I am just saying that
is how spun he is.

932
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:10,665
I got it under control.

933
01:06:10,665 --> 01:06:14,532
I got it under control. Alright?

934
01:06:14,534 --> 01:06:15,731
Say it!

935
01:06:15,733 --> 01:06:18,159
Say 'you, Frankie, have it under control'

936
01:06:18,697 --> 01:06:20,729
Say it!

937
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:23,695
You, Frankie, have it under control

938
01:06:23,697 --> 01:06:24,895
Right. Now say...

939
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:27,961
"I, Susan, am a whiney fucking bitch..."

940
01:06:27,963 --> 01:06:30,959
...and 'you, Frankie, have it under control'.

941
01:06:33,514 --> 01:06:37,511
I, Susan, am a whiney fucking bitch and
you, Frankie, have it under control.

942
01:06:38,213 --> 01:06:41,911
Right. Worse comes to worse I tell
everybody to go fuck themselves.

943
01:06:42,014 --> 01:06:45,911
Put $50 in the kids pocket
and stick him on a bus.

944
01:06:46,515 --> 01:06:47,881
You promise?

945
01:06:48,814 --> 01:06:50,181
I swear.

946
01:06:51,882 --> 01:06:53,048
See, bitch. Johnny.

947
01:06:53,048 --> 01:06:55,814
Hey.  What's the word?

948
01:06:55,814 --> 01:06:57,882
Great! What time?

949
01:06:57,883 --> 01:06:58,580
<i>Between 8 and 8:30. </i>

950
01:06:59,814 --> 01:07:01,653
Listen, man, I am going to have
to take him to a hotel or something.

951
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:02,848
<i>Who's there?</i>

952
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:05,814
My Dads bitch girlfriend up my
ass with a fucking broom.

953
01:07:05,814 --> 01:07:08,613
<i>-Let me know when you get there. 
-Alright</i>

954
01:07:08,614 --> 01:07:09,750
<i>-Okay?
-Alright, man.</i>

955
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:11,745
I will call you when I get straight.

956
01:07:13,883 --> 01:07:15,280
The kids going home.

957
01:07:32,584 --> 01:07:35,750
-What's up buttheads?
-Buddy, buddy, buddy

958
01:07:38,816 --> 01:07:40,370
We needed to borrow your Mum's car.

959
01:07:41,284 --> 01:07:42,417
Moving?

960
01:07:42,417 --> 01:07:44,413
Yeah, moving.

961
01:07:48,350 --> 01:07:50,417
Hold it right there.

962
01:07:50,419 --> 01:07:53,417
Yeah, let's go, yeah!

963
01:07:57,385 --> 01:07:59,217
You kids have a good time.

964
01:08:08,218 --> 01:08:09,350
What up?

965
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:11,385
When the fuck am I getting paid?

966
01:08:11,386 --> 01:08:13,286
Get in there!

967
01:08:13,286 --> 01:08:15,217
-You like this shit, yeah?
-Oh yeah.

968
01:08:15,872 --> 01:08:18,217
-Everybody out!
-Get the fuck out of here!

969
01:08:18,218 --> 01:08:20,384
Don't you see me on the toilet?

970
01:08:20,386 --> 01:08:24,383
-When I say get the fuck out...
-Let go of me!

971
01:08:24,419 --> 01:08:26,384
What the fuck you doing?

972
01:08:28,386 --> 01:08:30,418
Jesus!

973
01:08:30,419 --> 01:08:32,700
Listen to me, Ziggy, I say you
pays me today.

974
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:34,799
Oh? You don't have it?

975
01:08:35,302 --> 01:08:39,301
Listen!, Let me tell you something.  If you
see me, you don't want to fucking see me.

976
01:08:39,702 --> 01:08:41,735
Yeah, it is like that bitch.

977
01:08:41,737 --> 01:08:43,770
-Fuck you!
-I'm getting off

978
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:45,837
-Is that guy giving you a problem?
-Yeah, why?

979
01:08:46,838 --> 01:08:48,376
Let's kick his ass.

980
01:08:49,403 --> 01:08:51,569
All of a sudden you're a tough guy?

981
01:08:51,571 --> 01:08:54,471
I can fight him. I am fucking
black belt in Tae-Kwan-Do.

982
01:08:56,471 --> 01:08:57,637
You're ass?

983
01:08:57,637 --> 01:08:59,604
I am.

984
01:08:59,604 --> 01:09:02,338
-Looks like a picked the wrong man
-No shit.

985
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:04,604
Shit! Come here you little fucker.

986
01:09:04,604 --> 01:09:06,471
Let's go bitch!
How's that feel?

987
01:09:07,471 --> 01:09:09,503
Zack, you're hurting him

988
01:09:09,504 --> 01:09:10,571
Give him a little kiss.

989
01:09:12,572 --> 01:09:14,257
Fucking dumped it everywhere.

990
01:09:24,471 --> 01:09:25,200
The hell no, bitch

991
01:09:26,906 --> 01:09:29,004
The hell no.  You size me up?

992
01:09:38,839 --> 01:09:41,072
That was fucking awesome!

993
01:09:41,072 --> 01:09:45,069
Awesome!
This little bitch can fight.

994
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:47,871
Amazing

995
01:09:47,874 --> 01:09:49,004
Open the door!

996
01:09:49,006 --> 01:09:51,873
We are fighting.
There is no room for bitches.

997
01:09:51,874 --> 01:09:54,806
-or fucking queers
-or fucking queers

998
01:09:57,007 --> 01:10:00,974
-Let that sack of monkey shit in.
-Don't call me a sack of monkey shit.

999
01:10:00,975 --> 01:10:03,240
Jesus, what happened to your shit man.

1000
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:06,206
-I don't know, but we are out of booze.
-Already?

1001
01:10:06,208 --> 01:10:11,004
Tell your little freeloader friends to slow the
fuck down then dude. I'm not made of money.

1002
01:10:11,108 --> 01:10:13,241
I need a cigarette.

1003
01:10:13,241 --> 01:10:13,799
Alright!

1004
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:17,838
Everybody, keep everything under control.

1005
01:10:32,125 --> 01:10:33,192
This is him...

1006
01:10:33,193 --> 01:10:36,326
Zack, this is Elmer

1007
01:10:36,326 --> 01:10:40,322
Watch how fast I can down this shit.

1008
01:10:55,094 --> 01:10:59,089
Holy.... mother...

1009
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:01,826
Nice.

1010
01:11:01,826 --> 01:11:05,823
You should see me with a beer bottle

1011
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:09,857
Quit staring at me. You try!

1012
01:11:11,727 --> 01:11:13,758
Okay. Ready?

1013
01:11:13,959 --> 01:11:14,557
Go!

1014
01:11:35,495 --> 01:11:38,628
-So you're really stolen?
-Yeah, really am.

1015
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:41,328
He's cute.

1016
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:45,426
-You got a girlfriend, stolen boy?
-No

1017
01:11:47,596 --> 01:11:50,100
-How old are you?
-17.

1018
01:11:50,298 --> 01:11:53,293
-17?
This mother fucker is 15 years old.

1019
01:11:55,362 --> 01:11:57,762
Dude, what's your fucking problem.

1020
01:11:58,264 --> 01:12:00,496
I'm sorry
Jesus

1021
01:12:00,498 --> 01:12:03,492
They don't care anyway, man.

1022
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:08,226
Ever been laid, stolen boy?

1023
01:12:08,931 --> 01:12:11,397
-It's my birthday.
-Happy birthday, girl

1024
01:12:11,398 --> 01:12:13,330
-You guys give us a second?
-Why?

1025
01:12:13,331 --> 01:12:16,326
-I need to talk to Elvis, something private.
-Hurry

1026
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:26,197
So?

1027
01:12:26,998 --> 01:12:27,930
So what?

1028
01:12:28,631 --> 01:12:29,897
What do you think?

1029
01:12:31,197 --> 01:12:33,564
-What do I 'think'?
-Yeah, what do you think?

1030
01:12:33,564 --> 01:12:35,031
What do you mean 'what do I think'?

1031
01:12:35,132 --> 01:12:37,129
I mean about this whole thing.

1032
01:12:45,399 --> 01:12:49,395
I think no more music videos.
That's what I think.

1033
01:12:50,799 --> 01:12:51,831
Right.

1034
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:54,828
Fuck it.

1035
01:12:57,866 --> 01:13:00,862
-Do you need anything? Money?
-No

1036
01:13:04,016 --> 01:13:05,016
Got gas?

1037
01:13:06,516 --> 01:13:08,012
I got gas.

1038
01:13:11,116 --> 01:13:13,112
Okay then.

1039
01:13:19,318 --> 01:13:20,583
Truelove.

1040
01:13:21,283 --> 01:13:24,315
Are you ready to drink?
On my birthday.

1041
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:27,314
Where is he going?

1042
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:30,943
I hate it that you have to work so late.

1043
01:13:31,551 --> 01:13:35,048
Happy birthday, Angie.
Eat a piece of cake for me.

1044
01:13:56,318 --> 01:14:00,314
What are you doing?
This is the middle of the night, get in

1045
01:14:45,721 --> 01:14:46,450
Turn around.

1046
01:14:46,588 --> 01:14:50,584
-I don't get it?
-Just turn around.

1047
01:15:05,873 --> 01:15:07,971
Start counting

1048
01:15:08,972 --> 01:15:11,004
1... 2...

1049
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:15,001
...3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...10,
ready or not here I come.

1050
01:15:16,974 --> 01:15:20,969
-Marco?
-Polo.

1051
01:16:31,309 --> 01:16:32,572
You don't know every wish.

1052
01:16:34,161 --> 01:16:37,426
-What?
-I want to suck your cock.

1053
01:16:37,427 --> 01:16:41,596
Oh shit.

1054
01:16:42,432 --> 01:16:45,769
Wait, the wish is coming true.
The wish is coming true, oh Lordy.

1055
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:48,689
My wish is coming true.

1056
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,899
-Wait. I have to go make a call.
-No, you don't.

1057
01:16:56,092 --> 01:17:00,229
No, no,  why?

1058
01:17:00,229 --> 01:17:01,444
Bad.

1059
01:17:01,445 --> 01:17:03,676
-He's bad.
-Open the gifts.

1060
01:17:15,105 --> 01:17:17,016
What's happening, Zack?

1061
01:17:17,019 --> 01:17:19,368
I'm kinda busy.

1062
01:17:19,798 --> 01:17:21,987
<i>-Johnny?
-I am on my way</i>

1063
01:17:21,987 --> 01:17:26,156
<i>-Great. How long?
-Half an hour. Get everyone out, alright?</i>

1064
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:28,326
Yeah, you got it. You got it.

1065
01:17:31,493 --> 01:17:35,660
Hey, Hey. Zack's going home, party over.
All you mother fuckers got to go.

1066
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:41,952
Bye Zack,
I am glad you got home.

1067
01:17:42,269 --> 01:17:43,435
Thanks.

1068
01:17:43,435 --> 01:17:47,432
Now you got something to tell.

1069
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:51,153
-Call me sometime.
-I will.

1070
01:17:51,604 --> 01:17:52,636
You'd better.

1071
01:17:52,637 --> 01:17:54,602
Good-bye, stud.

1072
01:17:54,604 --> 01:17:58,600
And wipe that smile of your face,
you're a dead fucking give away.

1073
01:18:01,772 --> 01:18:04,669
Don't fucking move.

1074
01:18:05,669 --> 01:18:07,735
What?

1075
01:18:07,737 --> 01:18:09,669
Hey dude, just hang out with us.

1076
01:18:09,671 --> 01:18:12,835
-Man I was going to catch a ride home.
-He has love weed.

1077
01:18:12,836 --> 01:18:13,873
-Fuck
-Love it

1078
01:18:14,137 --> 01:18:18,038
-Whoop you, ladies.
-See you guys later.

1079
01:18:18,039 --> 01:18:21,172
Drive really fast with your eyes closed.

1080
01:18:21,173 --> 01:18:23,203
You're an asshole.

1081
01:18:23,205 --> 01:18:25,971
Roll up!

1082
01:18:25,971 --> 01:18:28,070
Bye, gorgeous.

1083
01:18:28,072 --> 01:18:30,203
Took his virginity, baby.
We did it. We did it.

1084
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:32,538
We love you a lot of Zack.

1085
01:18:40,105 --> 01:18:42,205
-Sonny?
-Hey, Elaine, how you doing?

1086
01:18:42,206 --> 01:18:46,137
-Is my boy here, I am looking for him.
-No, they went out for Angela's birthday.

1087
01:18:46,139 --> 01:18:50,136
Something's come up. Do you mind if we wait?

1088
01:18:51,972 --> 01:18:53,939
What are you doing here?

1089
01:18:53,939 --> 01:18:54,935
Outside.

1090
01:19:00,174 --> 01:19:04,169
What's the deal, Elvis?
Are you driving the kid home or what?

1091
01:19:04,206 --> 01:19:06,072
-What
-What?
-That's right.

1092
01:19:06,073 --> 01:19:10,068
What the fuck are you talking about?

1093
01:19:10,072 --> 01:19:12,068
-What the fuck?
-The kid ain't going home.

1094
01:19:12,157 --> 01:19:15,189
-But I thought that Johnny was...
-You thought wrong.

1095
01:19:15,190 --> 01:19:17,224
Fuck that, Johnny didn't tell me shit.

1096
01:19:17,225 --> 01:19:18,552
The decision's been made.

1097
01:19:19,690 --> 01:19:20,991
Fuck you!

1098
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:24,757
Fuck me?
Fuck you!

1099
01:19:24,758 --> 01:19:28,657
Johnny sent me here to take care of something
and I am going to fucking do it...

1100
01:19:28,657 --> 01:19:32,655
... with you or through you.

1101
01:19:34,725 --> 01:19:36,653
Who is sucking who's cock now, Frankie?

1102
01:19:37,024 --> 01:19:40,024
-Fuck that, I'm not...
-Fuck that. You're fucking in.

1103
01:19:40,024 --> 01:19:43,024
I'm up here cleaning up your mess and
you are going to fucking help me. .

1104
01:19:43,024 --> 01:19:45,158
...or the whole world is going to
come down on your head.

1105
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,156
Alright! Fucking let go of me.

1106
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:53,855
What the fuck do you want me to do?

1107
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:11,056
We needed some tape.

1108
01:20:15,456 --> 01:20:17,423
-Fuck that
-Dig?

1109
01:20:17,423 --> 01:20:18,656
Dig this bitch!

1110
01:20:18,657 --> 01:20:22,653
-What you going to do. . ?
-Fuck that. No fucking way.

1111
01:20:22,657 --> 01:20:25,657
No fucking way, Elvis.
I am not digging.

1112
01:20:25,657 --> 01:20:28,456
Fuck you. I did my shit.

1113
01:20:28,458 --> 01:20:32,583
This is the line, mother-fucker. Everybody's
got one and mine is a fucking grave, alright?

1114
01:20:32,692 --> 01:20:37,647
You want to shoot me? Shoot me right
fucking here. I don't give a fuck.

1115
01:20:37,648 --> 01:20:47,648
Hey... excuse me.

1116
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:08,689
Where's Frankie?
I need a ride home.

1117
01:21:27,226 --> 01:21:31,224
-What's going on, man?
-Come on! I need your help.

1118
01:21:32,557 --> 01:21:35,052
What the fuck do you need
duck tape for, dude?

1119
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:41,403
Where is everybody?

1120
01:21:42,171 --> 01:21:46,168
Keith said he needed a ride home
so that guy gave him one.

1121
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:51,338
What are you watching?

1122
01:21:51,338 --> 01:21:55,334
-Austin Powers.
-Alright.

1123
01:21:57,172 --> 01:22:00,272
Shit. So funny.

1124
01:22:00,273 --> 01:22:04,267
This shit has been going on for like...
2 minutes.

1125
01:22:13,507 --> 01:22:16,139
Do you want to run to the store for me?
Get me some cigarettes.

1126
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:19,136
Dude, I am too young and they
wont sell to me.

1127
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,306
Let's take a drive, go somewhere.
You wanna?

1128
01:22:33,306 --> 01:22:35,304
No.  I am cool.  I just want to watch a movie.

1129
01:22:51,274 --> 01:22:55,040
-Angela,  what did you do?
-Nothing

1130
01:22:55,041 --> 01:22:56,208
-Are you alright?
-She's fine.

1131
01:22:56,209 --> 01:23:00,040
-We are going in the other room...
-Fuck that. It is my birthday

1132
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:02,007
-We are going, right now.
-Party's over...

1133
01:23:02,008 --> 01:23:03,241
. . wait a second.

1134
01:23:03,241 --> 01:23:05,222
-Fuck
-Don't you talk to your mother like that
We are trying to help you.

1135
01:23:05,459 --> 01:23:07,559
-Where's the kid?
-Who?

1136
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,559
-Where is Mazursky?
-I don't know what you're talking about.

1137
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:13,323
Dad, I swear.
Fucking get off me.

1138
01:23:13,325 --> 01:23:16,325
Stupid.  Stupid, John.

1139
01:23:16,326 --> 01:23:20,451
Don't you fucking get it, you moron?
There's missing person poster
on every street corner....

1140
01:23:20,525 --> 01:23:23,653
You're in deep shit, Johnny.  If the cops
pick you up, you're doing 25 to life.

1141
01:23:23,693 --> 01:23:26,660
-Don't you think I know that?
-You've fucked your life up so bad.

1142
01:23:26,661 --> 01:23:30,625
The only way to un-fuck it is for you to come
clean now, John. You come clean!

1143
01:23:30,626 --> 01:23:32,758
-Right now.
-Calm down.

1144
01:23:32,759 --> 01:23:36,757
Let me talk to him, alright?

1145
01:23:37,592 --> 01:23:39,660
Look, everybody is getting excited here.

1146
01:23:39,661 --> 01:23:42,052
What your Father is trying to say...
is that we have a plan.

1147
01:23:42,257 --> 01:23:45,156
You bring the kid home.
We have a sit down.

1148
01:23:45,157 --> 01:23:47,256
Me, you, the mother the father, everybody

1149
01:23:47,257 --> 01:23:50,190
Sonny brings his cheque book and
we settle it right there.

1150
01:23:50,192 --> 01:23:52,290
-It will never work.
-I'm not saying it will.

1151
01:23:52,290 --> 01:23:54,257
You are probably looking at some jail time.

1152
01:23:54,258 --> 01:23:59,020
But if that is the only option then I'll walk you
right through custody.  We will do it the right way.

1153
01:23:59,125 --> 01:24:00,270
I guarantee you do minimum sentence.

1154
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,507
Be smart, kid.

1155
01:24:02,508 --> 01:24:05,540
-Let the spooks do the hard time.
-Fuck that! No jail.

1156
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:09,374
2 years? Piece of cake.
Winter, summer, winter, summer, done.

1157
01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:10,508
No

1158
01:24:10,508 --> 01:24:12,153
Then tell us your plan, Einstein

1159
01:24:13,641 --> 01:24:15,653
You tell us how this all turns out.

1160
01:24:18,708 --> 01:24:20,775
-Hey Keith, what's up.
-I fell.

1161
01:24:20,777 --> 01:24:22,907
You fell?

1162
01:24:23,908 --> 01:24:26,774
Don't fucking touch me.

1163
01:24:27,775 --> 01:24:28,153
What's up?

1164
01:24:29,076 --> 01:24:31,072
What's up, buddy?

1165
01:24:35,177 --> 01:24:36,209
You're Zack, right?

1166
01:24:36,609 --> 01:24:38,008
Yeah

1167
01:24:38,009 --> 01:24:41,043
Well, I'm Elvis and I'm going
to take you home, man.

1168
01:24:52,044 --> 01:24:52,903
You coming?

1169
01:24:53,911 --> 01:24:56,008
You gotta do this, man.

1170
01:24:56,009 --> 01:24:57,452
It has got to be unanimous.

1171
01:24:59,944 --> 01:25:04,000
If the kid goes home,
everybody is looking at life.

1172
01:25:04,943 --> 01:25:08,940
-Life?
-Life.

1173
01:25:09,012 --> 01:25:11,911
We talked to a lawyer, man...

1174
01:25:11,911 --> 01:25:15,907
and there is no way around it.

1175
01:25:17,078 --> 01:25:19,145
Life, for what?

1176
01:25:19,145 --> 01:25:21,977
For taking care of the kid?

1177
01:25:21,979 --> 01:25:22,952
For letting him sleep at my fucking house?

1178
01:25:23,629 --> 01:25:28,492
You were there from square one. You sat on him the
whole fucking time, you think you're gonna walk?

1179
01:25:29,195 --> 01:25:29,903
God damn!

1180
01:25:31,531 --> 01:25:32,528
Life?

1181
01:25:33,530 --> 01:25:34,926
There it is.

1182
01:25:38,528 --> 01:25:41,527
I mean, I like the kid.

1183
01:25:42,663 --> 01:25:44,661
Who's not to like?

1184
01:25:45,663 --> 01:25:46,602
He's 15.

1185
01:25:48,631 --> 01:25:51,126
He's just too much of a liability.

1186
01:25:52,164 --> 01:25:56,221
Think about it. We sent the kid home,
you've got Jake looking for you.

1187
01:25:56,330 --> 01:26:00,326
You don't want that. You don't go along,
Johnny don't trust you and he's coming after you. .

1188
01:26:00,330 --> 01:26:04,327
and you sure as shit don't want Sonny
Truelove knocking at your door.

1189
01:26:05,498 --> 01:26:07,142
We don't have a choice man.

1190
01:26:22,064 --> 01:26:25,996
My parents are going to fucking kill me.

1191
01:26:25,998 --> 01:26:29,931
I can just see my Mom...
She's just fucking...

1192
01:26:30,932 --> 01:26:32,996
Oh God.

1193
01:26:34,998 --> 01:26:36,998
Hey? Guys?

1194
01:26:36,999 --> 01:26:40,615
Listen, I would never rat you guys out.

1195
01:26:40,798 --> 01:26:44,407
You guys and me are like... like this.

1196
01:26:45,198 --> 01:26:47,052
Frankie, you know that right?

1197
01:26:47,733 --> 01:26:49,931
Yeah, we know that man.

1198
01:26:50,432 --> 01:26:50,932
Good.

1199
01:26:54,766 --> 01:26:57,665
I'm probably just going to say that...

1200
01:26:57,666 --> 01:27:00,866
I ran away or something to like...

1201
01:27:00,866 --> 01:27:04,798
...Bakersfield or Fresno, or some place.

1202
01:27:04,799 --> 01:27:05,753
Fuck it, you know?

1203
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:11,096
Hey. Does anyone know where Bakersfield is?

1204
01:27:11,168 --> 01:27:13,266
Say you were with a girl.

1205
01:27:13,866 --> 01:27:14,852
They would believe that.

1206
01:27:17,201 --> 01:27:19,052
Yeah, like Julie.

1207
01:27:34,169 --> 01:27:35,253
You know, when I get back...

1208
01:27:35,368 --> 01:27:37,602
...I am going to start fresh, you know?

1209
01:27:38,634 --> 01:27:42,631
I just want to start completely fresh.
D'you ever feel like that, Frankie?

1210
01:27:42,969 --> 01:27:44,967
-What's that?
-Like...

1211
01:27:45,568 --> 01:27:47,847
I don't know, like, go to Europe or something.

1212
01:27:48,001 --> 01:27:49,862
Or take a class or something like that.

1213
01:27:49,863 --> 01:27:52,500
or learn to play and instrument...
like guitar.

1214
01:27:53,501 --> 01:27:57,500
It sounds really fucking hard
to play guitar, but...

1215
01:27:57,637 --> 01:27:59,772
... it bugs me that I don't know
how to do anything.

1216
01:27:59,937 --> 01:28:01,852
I'm pretty sure I could, I'm...

1217
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:13,080
Johnny, call it off

1218
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:16,983
Nothing is going to happen. These guys are such
fuck ups the kid is probably loose right now.

1219
01:28:17,687 --> 01:28:18,352
Get in the fucking car!

1220
01:28:23,953 --> 01:28:25,552
What are we doing?

1221
01:28:25,554 --> 01:28:27,653
Meeting somebody who is
going to take you home.

1222
01:28:28,653 --> 01:28:29,923
Oh. Cool

1223
01:28:52,621 --> 01:28:55,653
You know? I think I am going to
start being nicer to my Mom

1224
01:28:56,972 --> 01:28:59,237
It's kinda gay, but...

1225
01:28:59,238 --> 01:29:06,072
... if you think about it. . she is the shit,
she is like my best friend, you know?

1226
01:29:23,690 --> 01:29:27,589
Fuck it. I can't do this man.
I gotta fucking go home.

1227
01:29:41,758 --> 01:29:43,753
Dude, what's going on?
You're crying.

1228
01:29:53,725 --> 01:29:55,052
Get away from me.

1229
01:30:00,059 --> 01:30:03,057
What's the matter with him?

1230
01:30:03,559 --> 01:30:05,254
Him?

1231
01:30:10,027 --> 01:30:11,423
Frankie, what's going on?

1232
01:30:25,727 --> 01:30:27,423
Frank?

1233
01:30:29,394 --> 01:30:30,953
Frankie?

1234
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:33,323
Dude?

1235
01:30:38,961 --> 01:30:41,052
-Oh, man.
-Ready? Let's do this.

1236
01:30:41,894 --> 01:30:44,826
-Man, please.
-Move!. Shut the fuck up!

1237
01:30:44,828 --> 01:30:46,995
-Please, I pray to God
-Relax.

1238
01:30:46,995 --> 01:30:49,993
-Frankie?
-Relax, Okay.  It's not what you think.

1239
01:30:49,995 --> 01:30:53,894
Yes it is. , Frankie.
Please. I thought we were boys.

1240
01:30:54,094 --> 01:30:57,092
-We ARE boys.
-Frankie, there is nobody up there.
Nobody's picking me up.

1241
01:30:57,094 --> 01:30:59,227
Yes, there is, ok?
Just stop freaking out.

1242
01:30:59,229 --> 01:30:59,932
-You promise?
-I promise.

1243
01:31:00,496 --> 01:31:04,653
Zack, everything cool. On my life.
Okay? I swear to God.

1244
01:31:05,256 --> 01:31:06,052
Come on.

1245
01:31:06,854 --> 01:31:08,822
I swear to God.

1246
01:31:08,822 --> 01:31:10,754
-Alright, man.
-Come on, man.

1247
01:31:10,756 --> 01:31:12,754
-Just walk.
-Alright.

1248
01:31:12,754 --> 01:31:14,003
We are just going to take a walk.
Come on, man.

1249
01:31:19,641 --> 01:31:22,671
Frankie, oh please?
I won't tell anybody, I swear to God

1250
01:31:22,671 --> 01:31:25,540
We are not going to do this, right?
I mean, we are not really going to do this. .

1251
01:31:25,540 --> 01:31:27,538
-Shut the fuck up.
-You ain't going to do it.

1252
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:29,671
-Shut your fucking mouth.
-He's crazy.

1253
01:31:29,673 --> 01:31:32,705
-This is stupid, man.
-God damn, it you got a conscience?

1254
01:31:32,706 --> 01:31:35,540
I won't tell my Mom about anything.

1255
01:31:35,540 --> 01:31:37,738
Shut his fucking mouth or
I'll fucking shoot him.

1256
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:38,706
-Alright, alright
-I'll Shoot him

1257
01:31:38,807 --> 01:31:41,741
-I'll never see you again, I swear
-Hey!

1258
01:31:41,741 --> 01:31:44,905
Look little man, you gotta calm down, alright?

1259
01:31:44,905 --> 01:31:48,903
-Everybody is nervous, right?
-I don't want to die, Frankie

1260
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:54,939
Everything is ok.

1261
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:57,841
-Alright?
-Frankie!

1262
01:31:57,842 --> 01:32:00,836
So what's the tape for, Frankie?

1263
01:32:03,875 --> 01:32:04,953
I would never hurt you Zackie, alright?

1264
01:32:07,442 --> 01:32:11,439
-Okay
-But I'll have to tape you up. .
So give me your hands

1265
01:32:12,543 --> 01:32:16,538
-Okay
-Everything is going to be alright.

1266
01:32:16,541 --> 01:32:19,342
-Hey, hey... I am your boy.
-I know.

1267
01:32:19,342 --> 01:32:21,407
-Okay
-Alright?

1268
01:32:21,408 --> 01:32:23,475
Everything is okay.

1269
01:32:23,477 --> 01:32:24,453
Everything is okay.

1270
01:32:28,777 --> 01:32:31,576
I don't want to die, Frankie.

1271
01:32:31,576 --> 01:32:32,852
I don't want to die

1272
01:32:37,576 --> 01:32:40,475
Now, I am going to have to
tape your mouth up, ok?

1273
01:32:43,876 --> 01:32:44,852
Alright. Okay

1274
01:32:46,092 --> 01:32:47,326
You're my boy.

1275
01:32:47,326 --> 01:32:51,322
I wouldn't hurt you

1276
01:32:53,227 --> 01:32:57,224
-Everything is okay.
-Alright.  I know

1277
01:32:59,044 --> 01:33:03,041
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

1278
01:33:13,594 --> 01:33:14,852
What the fuck are you doing?

1279
01:33:33,828 --> 01:33:34,903
Oh fuck.

1280
01:33:37,496 --> 01:33:38,753
Jesus fucking Christ

1281
01:33:50,762 --> 01:33:52,653
It was 6 o'clock in the morning...

1282
01:33:55,629 --> 01:33:59,530
Several... black cars pulled up and ....

1283
01:33:59,532 --> 01:34:01,729
There were men in suits....

1284
01:34:01,730 --> 01:34:04,953
And the... door bell was just ringing.

1285
01:34:08,730 --> 01:34:12,727
'We found your son'... they said

1286
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:17,830
'We found your son'....

1287
01:34:17,831 --> 01:34:21,826
'... and it's.... '

1288
01:34:22,466 --> 01:34:24,463
...bad news. '

1289
01:34:24,464 --> 01:34:28,461
They said.

1290
01:34:31,065 --> 01:34:32,043
What about the funeral...

1291
01:34:34,698 --> 01:34:38,695
-Jake didn't show?
-No.

1292
01:34:38,766 --> 01:34:42,762
He said it was out of respect for me.

1293
01:34:42,831 --> 01:34:44,798
That's a crock.

1294
01:34:44,798 --> 01:34:47,631
He just didn't want top get hit.

1295
01:34:47,633 --> 01:34:48,766
Sorry, I don't understand.

1296
01:34:48,766 --> 01:34:52,762
Shot, killed, murdered.

1297
01:34:53,733 --> 01:34:58,722
I happen to know he owes
$50, 000 to one drug dealer.

1298
01:34:58,866 --> 01:35:02,863
They have their own rules in the drug world.

1299
01:35:03,467 --> 01:35:06,599
They killed my son
for 1200 dollars.

1300
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:10,692
>I am so sorry for your loss.
>I mean I cant even imagine

1301
01:35:13,633 --> 01:35:17,631
When my son died,
I died.

1302
01:35:19,735 --> 01:35:25,666
I always loved him.
Every single day of my life...

1303
01:35:26,703 --> 01:35:30,697
and I wasn't afraid to show him.

1304
01:35:31,735 --> 01:35:35,701
What made you try to kill yourself?

1305
01:35:35,703 --> 01:35:39,698
You know....

1306
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:45,592
It seemed like a long time to my natural death.

1307
01:35:46,685 --> 01:35:48,717
I don't know

1308
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:50,818
You know, all three times...

1309
01:35:50,820 --> 01:35:54,815
...I tried to commit suicide
there was alcohol involved.

1310
01:35:56,437 --> 01:36:01,459
When I tried to kill me myself
in the hospital... I did wrong.

1311
01:36:02,469 --> 01:36:06,467
You know, your supposed to ...
do it like this.

1312
01:36:12,669 --> 01:36:16,666
Maybe it was the pills.

1313
01:36:17,437 --> 01:36:21,435
It's all bullshit anyway.

1314
01:36:21,439 --> 01:36:24,873
They say...

1315
01:36:25,471 --> 01:36:29,467
. . there is a reason for everything.

1316
01:36:32,504 --> 01:36:35,437
Well, if that God has got a purpose for me...

1317
01:36:36,822 --> 01:36:39,112
...he better get the fuck down
here and tell me what it is.

1318
01:36:42,905 --> 01:36:46,900
Because I don't see it.

1319
01:37:23,874 --> 01:37:27,868
I think that might be enough for today.
Okay?

1320
01:37:29,657 --> 01:37:30,953
Thanks

1321
01:37:34,056 --> 01:37:36,091
-Was that okay?
-Yes.

1322
01:37:36,092 --> 01:37:37,953
Okay
Sorry.

1323
01:37:51,258 --> 01:37:55,254
Jo!.  What's up?

1324
01:37:56,493 --> 01:37:57,956
Zack's dead

1325
01:37:58,358 --> 01:38:00,258
How'd you know that?

1326
01:38:10,258 --> 01:38:12,392
I had nothing to do with this.

1327
01:38:12,794 --> 01:38:14,692
I never laid a finger on him.

1328
01:38:15,693 --> 01:38:16,858
I didn't know this happened, Susan

1329
01:38:17,860 --> 01:38:19,592
I can't believe it happened.

1330
01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:22,391
-What the fuck is going on, Frankie?
-I don't know.

1331
01:38:22,392 --> 01:38:24,027
-Tell me the truth!
-I don't know. I think I am getting set up.

1332
01:38:24,126 --> 01:38:27,158
-Did you fucking take him home?
-Yes, I dropped him off in Pomona.

1333
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:29,225
Where? What street?
At his father's fucking house?

1334
01:38:29,227 --> 01:38:33,222
I don't know, okay?
I dropped him off in Pomona.

1335
01:38:33,794 --> 01:38:36,290
You'd better get yourself a good lawyer.

1336
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:39,956
Fuck you.

1337
01:38:43,294 --> 01:38:45,926
Can't come in here, man.
I'm serious, man. Get the fuck out of here.

1338
01:38:46,527 --> 01:38:47,552
I'm in trouble, Pick.

1339
01:38:47,554 --> 01:38:48,745
No shit.  With my Mom's car, man

1340
01:38:49,078 --> 01:38:51,078
-Why'd you do it, huh?
-Sorry

1341
01:38:51,078 --> 01:38:54,277
Mother fucker! Do you know how
much shit I've been through with this?

1342
01:38:54,278 --> 01:38:58,177
I'm fucked, Pick. You got to help me.
Can you just give me your car?

1343
01:38:58,179 --> 01:39:00,052
No, man.  Fuck that.

1344
01:39:00,479 --> 01:39:02,644
-Can you give me a ride out of town.
-Get the fuck out of here, man

1345
01:39:02,645 --> 01:39:06,443
-Where the fuck do you want me to go?
-It's your fucking problem.

1346
01:39:06,445 --> 01:39:09,610
Man, you got to let me use your phone.
I got to call Johnny.  Please?

1347
01:39:09,612 --> 01:39:10,443
Please?

1348
01:39:10,445 --> 01:39:12,352
Look, man... I love you
but your on your own.

1349
01:39:28,347 --> 01:39:31,245
Keep your hand in the air or I'll
blow your fucking head off.

1350
01:39:31,245 --> 01:39:35,243
Get down! I'm not fucking
with you asshole. Get down!

1351
01:39:35,381 --> 01:39:37,479
Down, on your knees now!

1352
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:41,211
I can't believe it.  They got Tiko too?
Tiko, Elvis, 911. They got everybody.

1353
01:39:41,213 --> 01:39:42,479
For what?

1354
01:39:42,479 --> 01:39:46,477
What the fuck do you think, baby?
That kid turned up dead.

1355
01:39:47,181 --> 01:39:48,472
Hey the captain and Tennille

1356
01:39:48,647 --> 01:39:52,642
-What can I do for you guys?
-Hey.  I 'd like to trade that for that.

1357
01:39:52,713 --> 01:39:55,612
-You want to trade this car for that car?
-Yeah.

1358
01:39:55,613 --> 01:39:57,780
Alright.  Let's go get you a loan out.

1359
01:39:57,780 --> 01:39:59,578
Wait, we don't have to do that.

1360
01:40:34,274 --> 01:40:35,653
You wanna fuck?

1361
01:40:41,306 --> 01:40:42,304
Alright

1362
01:41:22,775 --> 01:41:23,953
-Something wrong?
-No

1363
01:41:25,108 --> 01:41:28,075
No?
Your dicks not even hard.

1364
01:41:28,076 --> 01:41:30,076
-It's getting there.
-Getting there?

1365
01:41:30,076 --> 01:41:32,174
-Yes it's getting there.
-It's like a piece of bubble gum.

1366
01:41:32,176 --> 01:41:33,943
Then do something about it, bitch.

1367
01:43:45,930 --> 01:43:49,757
Unbelievable.
I hadn't seen Johnny since junior high.

1368
01:43:51,396 --> 01:43:53,720
I mean what a coincidence.
I look up and he is right there.

1369
01:43:55,297 --> 01:43:55,950
>Did he tell you want happened?

1370
01:43:59,103 --> 01:44:04,103
He told me some friends of his had
done some bad shit and he
was going down for it.

1371
01:44:04,104 --> 01:44:08,099
He said he was in big trouble and
needed help to get out of the country.

1372
01:44:08,203 --> 01:44:09,600
>And you agreed to drive him, just like that?

1373
01:44:10,770 --> 01:44:14,036
Yeah.
He's my boy.

1374
01:44:14,037 --> 01:44:16,270
He was stuck.

1375
01:44:16,271 --> 01:44:20,268
>Alright.  Go on.

1376
01:44:20,272 --> 01:44:24,700
Alright.  So we go up by 25, right. . ?

1377
01:44:25,431 --> 01:44:27,310
...and this guy is acting fucking weird, dude.

1378
01:44:27,715 --> 01:44:31,712
Talking about God and forgiveness.
All kinds of crazy shit.

1379
01:44:31,748 --> 01:44:34,547
So, we get to the border crossing...

1380
01:44:34,548 --> 01:44:34,947
And he starts flipping out...

1381
01:44:34,948 --> 01:44:36,982
...going crazy and I'm like
'dude, fucking calm down, bro'

1382
01:44:36,983 --> 01:44:40,748
'...we stop, we pull over, you get
in the trunk, it's all good...'

1383
01:44:40,749 --> 01:44:43,882
and he is like 'no, no, they know, they know'

1384
01:44:43,883 --> 01:44:47,879
You should have seen it.
He was going out of his mind.

1385
01:44:48,682 --> 01:44:50,949
So, we turn around, We turn around again.

1386
01:44:50,950 --> 01:44:53,849
Now he wants to go to Mexico.

1387
01:44:53,850 --> 01:44:56,400
So, we go all the way back down, drive
all the way back down and get to Cheyenne...

1388
01:44:57,103 --> 01:44:59,169
...and he changes his mind again.

1389
01:44:59,170 --> 01:45:03,166
I'm like: 'All right, dude.  That's it'.
'I can't do this forever. '

1390
01:45:03,270 --> 01:45:07,266
'Where the fuck do you want to go?'

1391
01:45:28,201 --> 01:45:29,250
I'll be right back.

1392
01:45:35,235 --> 01:45:37,167
I mean it, right?

1393
01:45:37,168 --> 01:45:39,101
5 minutes.

1394
01:45:39,102 --> 01:45:43,098
Alright, I wait for you.

1395
01:46:46,089 --> 01:46:50,121
It's been 4 years since your sons escape and,
you know what, I think you helped him.

1396
01:46:50,122 --> 01:46:51,500
I think you know exactly where he is?

1397
01:46:52,789 --> 01:46:55,665
There it is: the million dollar question.

1398
01:46:55,889 --> 01:46:58,988
What you, the cops, the feds, the
DA wants to know, right?

1399
01:46:58,989 --> 01:47:02,773
Somebody had to help him get out of the country.
Somebody has to be sending him money.

1400
01:47:03,008 --> 01:47:05,075
I do not know where my son is.

1401
01:47:05,076 --> 01:47:08,175
And if I knew, do you think I would
tell you and this fucking camera?

1402
01:47:08,176 --> 01:47:10,208
I think he is lost.

1403
01:47:10,209 --> 01:47:12,042
What?

1404
01:47:12,043 --> 01:47:16,204
The day he was dropped off at my house,
I reached into the fridge to get a sandwich...

1405
01:47:17,009 --> 01:47:18,450
I turned around and he was gone.

1406
01:47:18,610 --> 01:47:21,644
-Come on!.
-I am telling you, he's lost.

1407
01:47:21,645 --> 01:47:23,710
I think he is right

1408
01:47:23,711 --> 01:47:26,443
I mean, I ain't seen him.

1409
01:47:26,444 --> 01:47:28,509
He ain't here.

1410
01:47:28,510 --> 01:47:31,543
Must be lost.

1411
01:47:31,544 --> 01:47:35,540
Now, get the fuck outta my house!

1412
01:47:35,541 --> 01:47:45,541
