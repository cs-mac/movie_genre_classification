1
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:31,525
<i>Welcome, everybody,
to the hottest ski week in the world.</i>

2
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:34,590
<i>It's the annual spring ski pageant
and ski school director,</i>

3
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:36,328
<i>Reid Janssen, kicks things off</i>

4
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,894
<i>with an exhibition of skiing
that we've come to expect from him.</i>

5
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:41,406
<i>Yes, Reid has made this pageant his own.</i>

6
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:46,468
<i>Five grueling days for whom
Reid Janssen calls "serious skiers only. "</i>

7
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,652
<i>For Reid Janssen,
winning isn't everything,</i>

8
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,524
<i>it's the only thing,
and the competition here is fierce.</i>

9
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:04,028
<i>Each instructor is determined to prove</i>

10
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,361
<i>that he and his ski school section
are the best,</i>

11
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:10,267
<i>and Reid himself appears more determined
than ever to let no one dethrone him.</i>

12
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:12,327
Come on, let's go!
Bend your knees, bend your knees!

13
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,332
<i>I'm sure the last skier to beat Reid,
Dave Marshak,</i>

14
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,401
<i>head instructor for Section 8,
is preparing to do just that,</i>

15
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,848
<i>although he's curiously missing
from Reid's pre-pageant ski exhibition.</i>

16
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,510
<i>Slalom, downhill and freestyle.</i>

17
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:52,943
<i>Skiing is what it's all about</i>

18
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,503
<i>and this week promises
to be a memorable one.</i>

19
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:58,415
<i>The instructors will soon have
their ski school recruits before them,</i>

20
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,851
<i>so they are no doubt busy
trying to figure out a way</i>

21
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,980
<i>to defeat king of the mountain
Reid Janssen.</i>

22
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,580
- We are leaving, now.
- Cool out, Reid.

23
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,550
- How.
- Hi, Dave.

24
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,757
Hi, Reid.

25
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,161
Shut up.

26
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,195
I say this is your last year.
And there's nothing you can do about it.

27
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,295
You're too late, Reid.

28
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:55,170
I've already put into motion
an elaborate plan,

29
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,468
a series of events diabolically designed

30
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:01,002
to rid this mountain of you
and your satanic presence forever.

31
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,440
Before you think
about getting me off this mountain,

32
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,508
you're gonna have to win first.

33
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,681
- Okay.
- Okay.

34
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,248
Have you seen your recruits yet?

35
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,554
- Recruits?
- Recruits?

36
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:19,823
Who are you people?

37
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,195
I'm Ed.

38
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:26,669
Wow. We're gonna need all the help
we can get.

39
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,265
Sorry. Excuse me.

40
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,239
It's okay.

41
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,369
Come on, Lori.

42
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,581
He's cute, but look,
there's First Section.

43
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,016
Oh, yeah.

44
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,156
- What's your name?
- Paige.

45
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,319
Next.

46
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,887
I'm here to register.

47
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,060
Name?

48
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:30,894
Roland.

49
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:37,199
Roland. First name, John. Montana.

50
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:41,172
That's a long way, Roland comma John.

51
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:42,872
Where do you ski?

52
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,749
This little place in Montana.
You probably never heard of it.

53
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:50,352
Did you ever ski Sun Valley? Jackson?

54
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:53,716
No.

55
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,352
Who do you ski with?

56
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,254
Mostly myself.

57
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,731
Yourself.

58
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,771
And I suppose
you think you can ski with us.

59
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,266
Well, you guys are supposedly the best,
aren't you?

60
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,843
No, we are the best.
We're talking about you.

61
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,013
Maybe this'll help.

62
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,788
A letter of recommendation!

63
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:32,058
- How sweet.
- Look, I came here to ski, all right?

64
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:36,693
Yeah, well, you paid your money,
so you'll ski.

65
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,434
But not with us.

66
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,404
Well, then who do I ski with?

67
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,133
- Roland. That would be...
- Section 8, wouldn't it be, Derek?

68
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,875
Right, Reid. Section 8.

69
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:54,311
You go out the door, take two rights,
it's behind us.

70
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:05,486
"O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!

71
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:09,695
"Is it not monstrous that this player here,

72
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,135
"But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,

73
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,436
"Could force his soul so
to his own conceit...

74
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,641
"For what?

75
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,409
"For Hecuba!

76
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,778
"What is Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,

77
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,373
"That he should weep for her?

78
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,976
"He would drown the stage with tears

79
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,386

"Wherein I'll catch
the conscience of the King. "

83
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,260
Let's go skiing.

84
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,631
Hit some slopes or what?
- Yeah, right.

85
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,562
God. See that?

86
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,399
- Well, it wasn't bad.
- He really...

87
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,565
- Did you see that?
- We saw that, but it was...

88
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,834
He was... He was all right.

89
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,603
- I saw that.
- It was passable.

90
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,338
- Are you erect?
- Can we do that?

91
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,506
<i>Warm-ups are over
and it's time</i>

92
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:06,143
<i>for the All Star Ski School individual
and team competitions to begin.</i>

93
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,988
<i>The first event will be the slalom.</i>

94
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:14,459
<i>And stepping into gate number one
for Section 8 is Fitz Fitzgerald.</i>

95
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:18,159
<i>And in gate number two,
it's Erich Blor wearing the red uniform</i>

96
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,028
<i>of First Section.</i>

97
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,500
Come on, push it, push it! Come on!

98
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,539
<i>Skiers are competing for spots
in Sunday's final competition</i>

99
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:31,099
<i>where all times are applied towards
determination of the team cup winner.</i>

100
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,671
<i>Next up is Derek Stevens of First Section.</i>

101
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,778
<i>And opposite him is Ed Young
from Section 8.</i>

102
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,286
<i>Erich and Derek give First Section
a strong two-three punch</i>

103
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,758
<i>behind leader, Reid Janssen.</i>

104
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:54,124
<i>Stepping in now is the chief instructor
of Section 8</i>

105
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,431
<i>and former individual champion,
Dave Marshak.</i>

106
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,466
<i>While Marshak is always one
to ski well,</i>

107
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,269
<i>particularly in the freestyle event,</i>

108
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:05,333
<i>the team cup has always eluded him.</i>

109
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,574
<i>Next up is
director of the All Star Ski School</i>

110
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,312
<i>and the man who sets the standard
for others to follow,</i>

111
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,980
<i>number one, Reid Janssen.</i>

112
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:25,790
<i>Reid crosses the finish line
with a time of 29.55 seconds,</i>

113
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,561
<i>the only skier under 30 seconds so far.</i>

114
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:29,893
That's him!

115
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,368
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

116
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,098
<i>The final skier of the day
is a late arrival, John Roland,</i>

117
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,164
<i>skiing for Section 8.</i>

118
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,942
- Go, go, go!
- Go, John, go!

119
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:48,919
<i>Well, this newcomer could be
a welcome addition for Dave Marshak.</i>

120
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:53,289
<i>But it's too soon to tell
if Roland is only a one-day wonder</i>

121
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:56,886
<i>or if he'll fit in with the rigors
of the competition.</i>

122
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:06,570
<i>29.898 seconds
is John Roland's finishing time,</i>

<i>putting him in second place.</i>

124
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,408
Here you go.

125
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,579
- Great!
- Stick with us, kid, you'll go far.

126
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,025
Push, push, push, push!

127
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:31,425
How could you let one of those idiots
even contend with us?

128
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:34,489
That guy was pretty good.
How come he's not skiing with us?

129
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,535
Shut up, you pussy.

130
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,092
How do you expect to impress anybody

131
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,866
with the way you looked
on the hill today, huh?

132
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,610
Ken, you wanna get over there
and do sets with Derek?

133
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,441
You ladies look nice today.

134
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,251
Level eight?

135
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,618
What is this, lawn bowling, huh?
Move it to 12, come on!

136
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,249
Eight?

137
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,188
And you, come on,
move your knees, let's go! Move it!

138
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,295
Help. Help. Guys?

139
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,629
Guys, help!

140
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,459
Help!

141
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,869
Here, I'll help you with those.
They look really heavy.

142
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,462
- Thanks.
- Hey,

143
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,374
did you know you have really big muscles?

144
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,702
- You do.
- Thanks. Yeah, thanks.

145
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,213
- I'll get up now.
- Okay, thanks.

146
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,680
I did not mean to do that. No.

147
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,181
Guys.

148
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,525
- I'm... I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

149
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,924
Go away, I'm busy. I did not...

150
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,455
Howdy, boys!

151
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,126
- What are you doing here?
- I'm an ambassador of goodwill.

152
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,259
And who might you be?

153
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,065
Trying to cop a cheap feel
at the expense of my lady?

154
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:49,699
I'm simply helping
a damsel in aerobic distress.

155
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:55,941
What kind of men are you
who leave a struggling young lady

156
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,176
without anyone to spot her?

157
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:00,309
Shut up.

158
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,879
Wait, wait, I know who you are.

159
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,354
Throw his ass out.

160
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,983
Go ahead. Do with me what you will.

161
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,926
Beat me savagely
and leave me in the gutter to die.

162
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:15,358
Someday we will run naked
under a full moon!

163
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,295
Scum.

164
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:23,200
Don't worry, Paulette,
it'll never happen again.

165
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:32,810
Okay.

166
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,285
I hope I don't have to be
the one to tell you this,

167
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:41,224
but ski school is not
about learning how to ski.

168
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,652
You must be Ed.

169
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,924
Okay, party at the lodge at 7:00,

170
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,296
courtesy of
our esteemed ski school director.

171
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,800
Hot tubs at 11:30, contents TBA.

172
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,068
Let the games begin!

173
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,770
Okay, how many for chocolate hot tubs?

174
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,103
Duh!

175
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:05,116
What are we gonna fill the hot tubs with?

176
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:06,406
Women?

177
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,917
Good, good. Glad to have you with us.

178
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,584
Now, I don't know why you all came here,

179
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:14,990
but I suspect
a couple of you wanna sleep with me.

180
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,687
And, frankly, that scares me.

181
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,924
Entertain no fears.
We'll have you hooked up in no time

182
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,832
with what, to what, I'm not exactly sure.

183
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,237
Anybody have
anything else to add? Johnny?

184
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,405
- Let's win the race tomorrow.
- Of course, absolutely, win the race.

185
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,570
Any ideas on how we are going to win
this race?

186
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,738
Partying.

187
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,772
Party.

188
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:42,410
Party.

189
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,921
Party!

190
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,060
- This is not a party.
- It's a still life.

191
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,068
Everyone still has their clothing on.

192
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:06,236
Oh, my God. I think I've heard
this song at my dentist's office.

193
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,870
I don't know if I can do this, Dave.

194
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,006
This is totally and emphatically
against my principles.

195
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,346
No one said it was gonna be easy.

196
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,285
Now look closely, my friends,
because what you are seeing

197
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,481
is the beginning of the end.

198
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,754
And it's up to us to do something about it.
Who's with me? Me.

199
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,089
- Me.
- Me.

200
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:24,519
Welcome to my kingdom.

201
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:27,293
I will bed you all
before the night is through.

202
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,840
Pardon me.

203
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,779
Just a minute, that's my wine.

204
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,952
I'll be right back.

205
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,785
Paulette, I'm looking forward to it.

206
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,062
Do you have the time?

207
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,964
Time? Of course.

208
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,107
I'm... I'm sorry.

209
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,439
- No, it's okay, no, no.
- I'm...

210
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:16,640
I'm just gonna run upstairs
and change, okay? It's okay.

211
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,644
Change? What a good idea.

212
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,122
Definite possibilities.

213
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,991
And the only thing holding us back
is gravity.

214
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,037
She's not interested.

215
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,935
You are. Here, have a carrot.

216
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,921
You're registered
with the ski school, right?

217
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,719
Yeah.

218
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:11,430
Maybe I could give you
some personal instruction.

219
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,272
I could, too.

220
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,040
No, thanks. I think I can manage.

221
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,143
Hey, we're First Section.

222
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,005
Hey.

223
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,642
What does that mean, "First Section"?

224
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:30,149
You know, First Section.

225
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,753
Johnny.

226
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,704
Thanks, but no thanks.

227
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,142
Damn it, who's messing with the lights?

228
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,187
Where did he go?

229
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,492
Hello? Oh, it's you.

230
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,032
Well, Reid was telling some of his friends
that he was gonna sleep with me tonight.

231
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,838
I don't know.
I haven't made up my mind, you know?

232
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,971
I don't think
it's worth playing games with him.

233
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,074
Well, of course there's someone else.

234
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:36,747
He's... He's really cute
and I think his name is Fritz or Fitz.

235
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,221
I'm in love.

236
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,281
- I'm all shook up.
- I know he doesn't have any money,

237
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:44,193
but I don't know, there's just...
There's something about him.

238
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:48,290
Listen, I'm gonna get dressed
and I'll call you downstairs. Bye.

239
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,365
Paulette, you're killing me.

240
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,239
You're killing me.

241
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,408
Not now, Dave. Not... Not now.

242
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:33,338
Someone's trying to make me look bad.

243
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,169
A couple of up-tempo songs like this...

244
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,799
This party could get out of control.

245
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,971
Let's check it out.

246
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,096
Hey, buddy, looks like you're out of here.
Come on!

247
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,366
Yeah, you heard what he said.

248
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,873
- Come on, let's go...
- Guys, I'm telling you,

249
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,933
this isn't good for your karma!

250
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,110
Dick wad.

251
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,781
Play with these, fag.

252
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,455
Obviously not music lovers.

253
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,695
Perhaps the end
is closer than I thought.

254
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,531
They leave us with no alternative.

255
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,594
Well, you know what this means.

256
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,241
- Payback. Yes, I think so.
- Payback. Yes, I think so.

257
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,177
Should we be doing this?

258
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,985
I don't know. We'll find out.

259
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,391
Oh, look, champagne.

260
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,720
Looks expensive.

261
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,095
I don't think anyone will mind.

262
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,467
Here's a way to keep you warm tonight.

263
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,364
What?

264
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:47,977
Oh, right.

265
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,613
Why are you looking at me like that?

266
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:58,616
Sorry.

267
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,484
It's all right.

268
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,288
I think I hear someone.

269
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,923
- Really?
- Yeah.

270
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,136
I don't hear anyone.

271
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,702
Security!

272
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,371
- Who's the chick?
- Kid learns fast.

273
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,967
Nice semi-formal evening wear, I say.

274
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,910
All right, guys, what's going on here?

275
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,208
Anything is possible.

276
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,510
I like your attitude.

277
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:28,314
Now, as the authority figure in your life,
here's what I want you to do.

278
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:33,453
- Johnny's got potential, don't you think?
- I think so, yes.

279
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:36,685
How's the family?

280
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:39,094
Oh, Mom's okay, Dad's got tonsillitis.
Thanks for asking.

281
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,756
- Oh, darn.
- Yeah.

282
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,659
Johnny, my sister asked about you.

283
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,536
- How is Brenda?
- She's fine.

284
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,666
And tell little Curtis I said hi.

285
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,068
Right.

286
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,621
Hey, babe.

287
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,449
- I've had my eyes on you.
- Yeah?

288
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,121
Yeah.

289
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,796
I want you.

290
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:18,000
There's this little thing
that really turns me on.

291
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:22,168
I like to tell you what to do.

292
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,934
Just say the words.
I'll do anything you want.

293
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,542
Do you want to be with me, right now?

294
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:33,949
- Okay!
- No.

295
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,850
I want you to answer the questions
with the words that I use.

296
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,191
That's what really turns me on.

297
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:48,425
So do you want to be with me right now?

298
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,694
I really want to do it with you right now.

299
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,064
Can you wait for that to happen?

300
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,607
I can't wait for that to happen.

301
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,702
- Really?
- Really!

302
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,977
Give me five minutes

303
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:07,417
and I'll go upstairs and slip into something
a little more comfortable.

304
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:11,850
Now, when you come inside,
don't turn on the lights

305
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:15,222
and don't say a word.

306
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:20,653
Take off your clothes
and then slide into bed

307
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,060
right next to me.

308
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:28,270
This word thing has got me totally hot.

309
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,741
Derek, I've never met anyone
who has a way with words like you.

310
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:38,446
Remember, room 220.

311
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:44,246
Room 220. Where I'm gonna do you.

312
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,359
LORl: Hey, Erich, great party.

313
00:23:58,537 --> 00:23:59,629
Yeah.

314
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,870
Can I ask you something?

315
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,514
Your wish is my command.

316
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,747
Do you wanna have sex with me?

317
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:19,289
<i>I wanna have
outrageous sex with you.</i>

318
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:20,346
It's very interesting.

319
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,256
<i>Do you wanna run your fingers...
- Let me see the manual.</i>

320
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,419
<i>...all over my body?</i>

321
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,430
<i>I wanna run my fingers
all over your body.</i>

322
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:29,467
<i>Do you wanna tickle me
till I'm breathless?</i>

323
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,801
Here you go.

324
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:33,835
Make it happen.

325
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:48,352
I want you to see this film
so you know what makes me tick.

326
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:54,089
Don't you have another dress
to change into?

327
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:58,524
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
May I have your attention for a minute?

328
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:01,964
There's something very important
I'd like to share with you.

329
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:07,503
I've been fortunate enough
to have the vision to know what I want,

330
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,736
and the courage to go after it.

331
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:15,609
That's what this film is about.

332
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,912
If you understand this film,

333
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,309
then you understand what I'm about,

334
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:28,557
and what my All Star Ski School
can make you about.

335
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:34,489
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

336
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:45,265
<i>Do you remember what it was like
the first time you put on skis?</i>

337
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:49,341
<i>For Reid Janssen,
it was like nothing he'd ever experienced.</i>

338
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:53,783
<i>Skiing became the dawn of possibility,
the commencement of life.</i>

339
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:57,121
<i>For Reid Janssen, it became crystal clear
what to do</i>

340
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:59,679
<i>with the gifts bestowed upon him.</i>

341
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:04,161
<i>He created the All Star Ski School,
his mission of a lifetime.</i>

342
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,504
Hi, baby.

343
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:25,079
Just close your eyes and fantasize.

344
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:30,947
<i>Now, when I come into the room,
I don't want you peeking.</i>

345
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,457
<i>It might take me out of the mood.</i>

346
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:39,662
Chicks dig me!

347
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,495
Frighteningly easy.

348
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,448
God, I'm good.

349
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,994
- Reid?
- Yeah, babe.

350
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,703
You're not paying any attention to me.

351
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,841
God, I love it when I do that.

352
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,040
I think you'd rather make it
with Erich or Derek.

353
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:03,770
Yeah.

354
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:16,190
<i>I wanna run my fingers all over your body.</i>

355
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:20,325
<i>Just say the words.
I'll do anything you want.</i>

356
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,329
<i>I want to have...</i>

357
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,869
What the hell's going on?

358
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:28,132
<i>...outrageous sex with you.</i>

359
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,640
<i>I can't wait for that to happen.</i>

360
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:39,009
This is some kind of joke.
Somebody set this up.

361
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,109
<i>Your wish is my command.</i>

362
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,548
- This is the good part. Yeah, yeah.
- I like the next part.

363
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,719
This is not my film.
My men are not homosexuals.

364
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:55,091
This is a fraud, can't you see?
They're not even in the same room.

365
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:11,274
- You did a good job.
- Thank you.

366
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:12,373
Excellent work there.

367
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,652
- Hey, come on, let's go.
Reid, Reid, Reid!

368
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,623
Hey. Don't come back here again.

369
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:23,457
Marshak, crawl back
in your hole and die.

370
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:26,696
We came, we partied, we conquered.

371
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,258
Yes!

372
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:31,461
The mountain is ours. Let's dance.

373
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:54,949
Hi.

374
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:57,920
Hey.

375
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,667
There's no more champagne.

376
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,143
Johnny?

377
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:21,240
Yeah?

378
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,746
What's happening here?

379
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,615
I don't know.

380
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:31,020
I do.

381
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:50,540
What is happening here?

382
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:55,775
Don't worry, it's okay. No strings.

383
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:08,057
So, Derek, don't worry about last night.

384
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:11,124
I've already scammed
on three babes today.

385
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,330
- The master.
- Yeah. I'm giving one to you.

386
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:17,303
Way to make that homo stuff work for us.

387
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,173
You got it, Big D. Catch you later, huh?

388
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,871
Don't do that.

389
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,483
My client would like to inspect
the property,

390
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,250
but she feels the price is not too far off.

391
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:35,451
<i>Yes, I think it's an excellent price
when you consider the upside potential.</i>

392
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:39,221
Did you see those projections
I left for you?

393
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:41,688
Yes, I'll hold.

394
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:47,432
Reid, these people are worth millions

395
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,370
and they're depending on me
and I've gotta depend on you,

396
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,500
but you are fucking me up.

397
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:57,009
You see, they're buying the mountain.

398
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:02,442
When they do,
I'm going to end up owning a major share.

399
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,148
Now, if I own a major share,

400
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,122
you're going to own
a little piece of that pie yourself,

401
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,885
do you understand?

402
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:11,023
So I'm gonna tell you one last time.

403
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:15,225
You and your clones have to start
taking care of business now.

404
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,997
Then why don't we just throw
the scum out now?

405
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:21,163
Because Dave Marshak is
some kind of goddamn folk hero

406
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,365
to a lot of people around here.

407
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,532
In order to toss him out,

408
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:27,066
I've gotta have one hell of a good reason.
You got it?

409
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,437
Yeah, I got it.

410
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,215
Looks like you didn't get much sleep
last night, Reid.

411
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,454
I think the caffeine and the crack
is really hurting you.

412
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,162
Pay attention, Marshak.

413
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:50,189
You're in deeper than you think
and we're gonna bring you down.

414
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:55,639
In fact, if I were you, I wouldn't
even bother showing up on the slopes.

415
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:59,939
You and your merry pranksters
don't belong on this mountain.

416
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,639
Not anymore.

417
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:07,340
You know, you may all think
you're just having a great time,

418
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:11,115
but by the end of this week,
you're all going home losers.

419
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,721
Shit's going down
and you're gonna be gone.

420
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,692
You guys are way too serious.

421
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,360
And don't fuck with us.

422
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,831
Oh, no, I think it's Erich
that wants to fuck with you, Derek.

423
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,234
Real funny, huh?

424
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,067
Call it a warning.

425
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,152
Did... Did we win?

426
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,114
Oh, hi, guys. Did we win?

427
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,199
<i>Day two is underway
here on the south course</i>

428
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:59,031
<i>for the second round of slalom qualifying.</i>

429
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:00,695
<i>The First Section's far out in front.</i>

430
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,240
<i>The remaining sections are struggling
to keep pace.</i>

431
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:06,071
<i>And with the way things are looking,
it's going to be more of the same</i>

432
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:10,308
<i>as First Section continues
to put its mark on the entire mountain.</i>

433
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,124
Wow! All right!

434
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:31,493
Dave, you will never get me
because I have perfect hair.

435
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:35,301
Yes, we will
because we are wacky, offbeat types.

436
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:36,772
Oh, my God!

437
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:39,276
It's Godzilla!

438
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,814
Fitz, how could we let this happen?

439
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:53,319
Godzilla! He just came and...

440
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:57,691
No, I'm talking about the mountain.
It's in desperate trouble.

441
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,528
Do you have any ideas?

442
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:07,368
Subliminal hypnosis.

443
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:14,175
Suggestions to their subconscious mind
as they doze.

444
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,887
If you wanna be the best,
you must lose your mind.

445
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:31,325
If you want to be the best,
you must lose your mind.

446
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,190
Johnny,

447
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:38,895
<i>if you want to be the best,
you must lose your mind.</i>

448
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,568
<i>It's time
for the freestyle competition</i>

449
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,336
<i>and first up is Section 8's John Roland.</i>

450
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:04,059
Yes! Yes! Yes!

451
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,607
<i>Most impressive is Section 8,
moving way up to fourth place</i>

452
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,910
<i>in the competition for the team cup.</i>

453
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,040
<i>I don't know what it was they did,</i>

454
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:02,017
<i>but they should do more of it
as they look towards tomorrow.</i>

455
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:06,384
Ed, you have sex with too many women.

456
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:11,056
You will stop having sex
from this moment on.

457
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:15,463
If you understand, nod your head.

458
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,804
If I'm not mistaken...
And you rarely are.

459
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:34,078
...those are some of Reid's women
from the party.

460
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:37,678
Swimming semi-naked.
They leave us no alternative.

461
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,347
- Chocolate pudding!
- No, not so fast.

462
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,254
We don't wanna peak too early.

463
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,420
Look, guys, I'd love to stay,
but I have to get back to a dream.

464
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,391
I'll see you guys later.

465
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,230
- Hi.
- You're cute.

466
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,301
He is a phenomenon.

467
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,574
Back to the matter at hand.

468
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:07,013
Not so fast. I have a plan.

469
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,252
What is that?

470
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:12,083
It's not that I don't want to.

471
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:14,954
I mean, it's not that I'm not able
because I am.

472
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:17,085
It's just that I can't.

473
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,965
Not physically.
I mean, I'm not called Mr. Ed for nothing,

474
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,432
but it's just something in my head.

475
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:26,561
It's like this dream
that keeps reoccurring that...

476
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,332
You're not buying this.
I know you're not buying this

477
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,430
but it's true, I mean...

478
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:33,568
- Wait a minute!
- What are you guys doing here?

479
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,134
- Hello.
- Hi.

480
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:37,180
I know what you're thinking,
but worry not, my children,

481
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:38,806
because we are employed by...
What's his name?

482
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,214
- Master race.
- Master Reid.

483
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:41,478
- Master Reid?
- Master Reid.

484
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:42,576
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

485
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,850
And he asked us to stop by
and make sure you were prepared

486
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,151
for tomorrow's activities.

487
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:48,748
And in order to be completely ready,

488
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:52,159
he made us promise him to teach you
how to lambada.

489
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:53,992
- The forbidden dance.
- The forbidden dance.

490
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:57,967
And how appropriate it is
that we find you here in a sauna.

491
00:38:58,035 --> 00:38:59,627
No questions from you just yet.

492
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:00,864
Fitz here is going to brief you

493
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:03,304
on the historical perspective
of the lambada.

494
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:04,841
- Take it away, Fitz.
- Thank you, Dave.

495
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,240
You're welcome, Fitz.

496
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,608
Lambada.

497
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:13,943
<i>The movements have been around
before time itself.</i>

498
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,007
<i>Criminy, that's a long time.</i>

499
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:20,319
<i>It started centuries ago with
the South Americans, who discovered fire.</i>

500
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:23,592
<i>Fire? That's hot.
- Hot, hot, hot.</i>

501
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,762
- Lambada.
- Lambada.

502
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:36,964
- Lambada.
- Lambada.

503
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,733
- Lambada.
- Lambada.

504
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:43,645
And that's how the lambada came to be.

505
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,841
Don't forget, ladies,
Reid wants a full demonstration,

506
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:47,076
bright and early in the morning.

507
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,119
Otherwise, why would we be here?

508
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,278
Ain't no reason.

509
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:54,017
Now, let's lambada, shall we?

510
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:55,558
Okay, grab your partners.

511
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:57,719
Everybody, come on, get up,
find a partner.

512
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:59,990
- You guys, get up, get a partner.
- Hello.

513
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,998
Come on now, let's get into it.

514
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,624
Now we're gonna lambada!

515
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:06,363
Now grab your partner
by the waist. Ready?

516
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:11,908
Gyrate, gyrate, gyrate motion.

517
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:20,981
Like a sack full of ax handles.

518
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:23,544
Right.

519
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:25,919
I could dance with you
till the cows come home.

520
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:29,357
Better still, I could dance with the cows
till you come home.

521
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:32,221
- Oh, Christ, I've come.
- Oh, Dave!

522
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,024
Fitz, Reid will be so pleased.

523
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,600
And how. Wink, wink.

524
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:40,398
<i>Kumbaya, my Lord</i>

525
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,666
<i>Kumbaya</i>

526
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,402
Reid, I don't understand
why Paulette came here

527
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,272
if she doesn't like to ski.

528
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:53,142
Don't you get it, Derek?
Because of who we are.

529
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:57,078
I mean, that's why people wanna
be around us. We're the best.

530
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:59,520
That's what makes us attractive.

531
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:10,266
It's not like I could have sex at any time.

532
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,106
Beer pump, magic foam...

533
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:18,906
Good book?

534
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,170
Anyone have a problem with that?

535
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:25,237
- No!
- No!

536
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,341
Not me, man.
- Well, I got a problem with that.

537
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:33,788
What the hell is this mountain coming to?

538
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:37,555
Half-naked girls walking around
at 9:30 in the morning?

539
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,661
Last year, they were completely naked
at 9:30 in the morning.

540
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:46,191
Do you think she's gonna walk around
like that all day?

541
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,662
Or will she be back

542
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:52,141
for a 5:30 hot tub?

543
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:54,575
I don't wanna have sex with her either.

544
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:58,874
I mean, it's not like I'm Dave.

545
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,910
Pumpkin?

546
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:05,945
She loves me.

547
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:09,321
These women, man,
they just don't understand, you know.

548
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:11,623
Sometimes I just wanna cuddle.

549
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:44,052
<i>Well, ladies and gentlemen,
day four is over,</i>

550
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:47,029
<i>and it's First Section continuing to lead
the team cup race</i>

551
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:49,292
<i>behind its leader, Reid Janssen,</i>

552
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:52,358
<i>who remains in first place
in the individual competition.</i>

553
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:54,700
<i>Up to second place
in the individual standings, however,</i>

554
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:58,674
<i>is John Roland who proves
that his fast performance was no fluke.</i>

555
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,972
That's Johnny Roland.

556
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:04,541
- Nice going, Johnny.
- Hey, we can do better.

557
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:15,318
Who is she?

558
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:18,452
- Where did she come from?
- Do you really care?

559
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,591
Oh, my fucking God.

560
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:33,136
This is shit. Let's get out of here.

561
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:05,664
Two nights ago, I was having
an out-of-body experience.

562
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:09,035
I was an Indian chief

563
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:13,550
and I was in the banquet room
of the lodge and your evil twin was there.

564
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:17,446
We were completely naked
and we were on top of the podium

565
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,586
and she was really getting
into my headdress.

566
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:29,295
And I was doing an obscure,
yet all-too-familiar rain dance,

567
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:35,502
and my feathers were having
a very, very ticklish effect on you.

568
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:40,304
She was saying something... What was it?

569
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:44,403
Was it something about your wigwam?

570
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,810
Yes. Yes, my wigwam.

571
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:53,479
And there was an adjective used
to describe my wigwam.

572
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:55,716
That's not important now.

573
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:57,522
Reid, what a surprise!

574
00:44:57,594 --> 00:45:00,085
We were just talking
about Paulette's twin sister.

575
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:02,155
- What?
- Paulette. She has a twin.

576
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:03,824
Didn't you know?

577
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,404
What's he talking about?

578
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:08,961
My other half.

579
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:12,234
Your other half? Well, I'd love to meet her.

580
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:16,268
I bet you would. A rare pleasure.
She was here a couple nights ago.

581
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:19,076
Reid, good skiing on the mountain today.

582
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:23,679
Indeed. Your boys really seem
to be holding their own.

583
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:30,849
That is so witty. He kills me.

584
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,723
Dave, Dave, Dave.

585
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:35,793
When are you going to grow up, huh?

586
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:37,356
When you admit that you love me

587
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:40,699
and can't live another day
without me by your side.

588
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:45,202
Paulette, would you care to join me
at another table?

589
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:50,144
I'd love to hear about your twin sister.
It sounds so distinct.

590
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:54,145
Well, she's not at all like me.

591
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:57,346
So she's boring, stupid, and ugly.

592
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,184
Reid, you animal!

593
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:04,459
Shut up, Dave. I'd hate to have to make
an example out of you.

594
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:11,160
<i>Will the director of ski school
please report to Sector 7?</i>

595
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,800
<i>Director of ski school, report to Sector 7.</i>

596
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,702
Excuse me, that's me.

597
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:22,338
- Fitz, have you met Paulette?
- No! As a matter of fact I haven't, Dave.

598
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:24,505
- Well, do what you will.
- Hi, I'm Fitz.

599
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,811
- I'm Paulette.
- Paulette.

600
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:29,145
Can I just tell you that that dress

601
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:32,916
you were wearing the other night
looked very attractive?

602
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:38,518
- Thank you.
- No. No. No. No. Thank you.

603
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:43,725
Snowballs, get your snowballs.

604
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,133
Good, there, take a snowball.
Have a snowball!

605
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:49,764
Here you go. Good. Take two,
one for the little lady. Snowballs!

606
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:07,585
Hi, may I?

607
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:09,651
Sure.

608
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:14,625
- How did you do that?
- How did I do what?

609
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:17,928
Second place already.
I've been watching you ski.

610
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:20,767
- You're really good.
- Thanks.

611
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:24,200
- Do I know you?
- I'm Victoria.

612
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:26,336
- Johnny.
- I know.

613
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:33,482
Isn't that Johnny?
- Johnny? Yeah.

614
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:36,108
Man, she is totally hitting on him.

615
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:39,617
Hey, it's no big deal. I don't own him.

616
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,824
What am I gonna do with you, Johnny?

617
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:50,124
I don't know. What do you wanna do?

618
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:54,293
Here, this will explain everything.

619
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,140
- See you.
- Bye.

620
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:09,012
Fitz, that boy is definitely one of us.

621
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:12,021
Do you know
that wolves are monogamous

622
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:13,920
and are believed to mate for life?

623
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:16,255
Snowballs! Red-hot snowballs.

624
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:17,816
- Get your snowballs. Here you go, sir.
- Thank you.

625
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,159
Take one for the lady. Good. Good. Good.

626
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,755
Pretty lady like you
deserves two snowballs.

627
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:24,130
You little twerp, what the...

628
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:25,862
We didn't even make out.

629
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,864
Family fun. Fun for the whole family.

630
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:42,108
And now for another game of
"Who's underwear is it?"

631
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:44,747
with your host, it's Fitz!

632
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:48,176
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

633
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:53,883
Let's have a nice, warm hello,
for today's guest underwear.

634
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:57,686
- Whose underwear is it?
- Whose underwear is that?

635
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:00,889
These underwear were worn
two weeks ago Saturday,

636
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:04,965
and the owner's name begins
with a consonant.

637
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:06,697
- Kim.
- Donna.

638
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:07,794
"D"! Good!

639
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:09,099
- "D".
- "D".

640
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,776
- Denika.
- Denika.

641
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:19,312
If you'll notice the lacing,
the pretty trim, and the bow... Derek's.

642
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:20,607
- Derek!
- Derek!

643
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,652
- I knew that!
- "D"...

644
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:32,088
Guys, where are all the babes?

645
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:35,859
Ed, don't you think you talk about babes
a little too much?

646
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:37,991
No.

647
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,538
Well, well, well.

648
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:52,278
Anybody got a beer?

649
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:56,752
- Mr. Bryce, nice jacket.
- Shut up!

650
00:50:57,187 --> 00:51:00,156
This time, Marshak,
you've gone way too far.

651
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,784
And I'm giving the board of directors
a full report of your conduct.

652
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,761
The skiing naked. The snowballs.

653
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,966
And you, your unspeakable behavior also.

654
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:12,058
You're all a bunch of animals.

655
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:14,862
And you're as good as out of here,

656
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:18,965
because it's just a simple matter
of filing the proper paperwork.

657
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:22,705
So put that in your pipe
and smoke it, mister.

658
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:27,575
- You got a problem, young man?
- No.

659
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:30,551
Fine. Have a nice night.

660
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:38,688
"Put that in your pipe
and smoke it, mister"?

661
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,992
Hey, wait a second, guys.
Maybe he's right.

662
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:43,032
Maybe we have gone too far.

663
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,263
Ed, it's not how far you go,
it's how go you far.

664
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:48,428
- We party here.
- We party big.

665
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,268
- We party now!
- Office party.

666
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,535
Ed, you get beer. Fitz, you get beer.

667
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:56,101
Johnny, you get laid.
Let me see Victoria's address again.

668
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:01,143
Guys.

669
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:07,550
Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny!
- Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny!

670
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,251
Lose your mind! Lose your mind!

671
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:14,562
Have a look around. I'll be right with you.

672
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:15,823
Okay.

673
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:21,370
Looks just like my place.

674
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:28,936
Hi.

675
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:31,471
Hi.

676
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,546
So what exactly do you do?

677
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,846
Oh, I like to spend money.

678
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,916
Sounds like fun.

679
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,258
You're very perceptive.

680
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:49,858
Hey, some friends of mine
are having a party.

681
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:52,060
Do you wanna go to it?

682
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,162
Sure.

683
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:58,568
What shall I wear?

684
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:15,354
Okay, who's smoking?

685
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:20,222
Fitz! Pass 'em out, Fitz!

686
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:35,802
Yes.

687
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,369
Lights out!

688
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:08,443
- See anything?
- Yeah, I see lots of things.

689
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:24,854
- Johnny.
- Yeah.

690
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:31,725
Can't you find something?

691
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:54,850
God, you're cute.

692
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:09,132
What time did you say
the party starts?

693
00:55:57,087 --> 00:56:00,079
If I was any closer,
I'd be in the other room.

694
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,351
Yes! Yes!

695
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:09,956
Reid will be so pleased.

696
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:22,244
Hi! Hello. Hello.

697
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:24,778
What the hell? Yeah, come on in.

698
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:27,913
Let's go.

699
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,889
Watch out!

700
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:40,724
Yes, I'd like to make
a long-distance phone call to Guam please.

701
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:43,291
Guam.

702
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:49,466
Now, there's something you can
do for me.

703
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:20,102
They're dead.

704
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:54,765
Three, two, one, go!

705
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:09,450
Come on. Come on.

706
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:15,987
Three, two, one, go!

707
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,547
Three, two, one, go!

708
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:00,765
Get off me, you pervert!

709
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:05,431
Come on, Dave!

710
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,809
Hey, Reid...

711
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:19,685
Three, two, one, go!

712
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:30,528
<i>Reid, second to the pole!</i>

713
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:37,064
Oh, my... Reid, let me tell you
about my sister.

714
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:42,811
Oh, God damn... Not feeling good.

715
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:52,311
Hi, Reid.

716
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,319
Oh, God.

717
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:01,824
Hi.
Hey, Karen, how's it going?

718
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:05,061
Hey, look, guys,
it's little Dave and his wienies.

719
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:07,326
Some nice skiing
on the mountain today, guys.

720
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:10,861
What, a one out of 15
in the qualifying round?

721
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:13,704
I got a better return on my savings bank.

722
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:15,173
Lori?

723
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:18,543
What happened to you?

724
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,978
I don't really know.
Can we talk for a minute?

725
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:25,847
Yeah, I guess so.

726
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:29,187
What's going on?
What happened yesterday?

727
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:31,119
What?

728
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:35,422
Hi, I'm having a party
after the competition.

729
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:38,062
I expect you all to be there.

730
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,763
Look, I gotta go.

731
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:44,437
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I don't understand.

732
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:48,705
- First you say no strings, then...
- Yeah, I said no strings. So what?

733
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:51,474
Well, which is it? I didn't say anything.

734
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:55,779
That's right, Johnny,
you didn't say anything.

735
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,417
I guess I'll see you.

736
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:05,424
Tough day.

737
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:07,560
Tough day.

738
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:11,057
Johnny may be the only one doing good
in the singles competition,

739
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:13,329
but we still have a chance
for the team cup.

740
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:14,563
Right.

741
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:18,230
Hey, you guys, maybe we should go
to bed earlier tonight, man.

742
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:20,867
We haven't even partied yet.

743
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:23,070
- Maybe partying will help.
- No, no.

744
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:26,604
Ed's right.
It's time to pull back and take it easy.

745
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:31,383
Now, I know a quiet little restaurant
where we can get a nice piece of fish.

746
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:32,887
Just relax.

747
01:02:15,698 --> 01:02:17,757
You know, Johnny's becoming
a pretty good dancer.

748
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:22,669
I know. The plan is working perfectly.
There's just one more thing I must do.

749
01:02:22,872 --> 01:02:23,930
Johnny loves you.

750
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:26,899
You love Johnny.

751
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:29,809
Johnny loves you. You love Johnny.

752
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:36,246
Show Johnny that you still love him
even though he's losing his mind.

753
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:43,691
Show Johnny that you still love him
even though he's losing his mind.

754
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:06,314
What are you doing?

755
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:07,940
Left foot red.

756
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:13,984
I'll do anything for you now.

757
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:11,069
What the hey?

758
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,712
"Instructor and students of Section 8."

759
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:15,216
"You are called to appear before

760
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:18,481
"the general manager
of Sky High Properties Inc.

761
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:21,322
"for the purpose of disciplinary review. "

762
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:25,087
"The hearing will commence at 7:30 a. m.,
Saturday, March 12,

763
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:28,155
"in the office of the general manager. "

764
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:30,597
That's now!

765
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:38,335
As of this morning,

766
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:42,303
according to the determination
of the board of directors,

767
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:46,612
Dave Marshak is hereby placed
on disciplinary suspension,

768
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:53,750
and all of the students enrolled
in Section 8 are expelled.

769
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:55,253
Expelled?

770
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:57,787
This is ski school.

771
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:00,351
Well, shall we say disqualified, then?

772
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:03,956
- You guys are way too serious.
- You can't disqualify us.

773
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,098
Does this mean we can't ski
in the final competition?

774
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:08,636
Hold it, man.

775
01:05:09,005 --> 01:05:10,870
These kids paid good money to come here

776
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,374
and buy me expensive, imported beers

777
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:15,239
just so they could go home knowing

778
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:17,711
that they have done something good
for their fellow man.

779
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:21,511
I am not going to send these kids back
to the great towns they came from

780
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,678
with the feeling that their rights
to be together, have a good time,

781
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:28,087
and yeah, do a little skiing,
have been usurped.

782
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:32,617
So put that in your pipe and smoke it,
Mr. Anton Bryce.

783
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:35,596
And Dave's a great instructor, bud.

784
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:41,302
Then why don't you tell me exactly
what it is you've all learned here then?

785
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:46,066
Well, Dave's taught me, like,
a lot of really neat moves.

786
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:48,301
What about you?

787
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:51,312
Well, I'm not exactly sure
what I've learned.

788
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:55,007
But how many of you
have seen Paulette buck-naked?

789
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:57,579
- I have, it's great.
- I know you have.

790
01:05:57,653 --> 01:06:00,281
- Wow! Wow! Wow!
- Enough is...

791
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:02,521
Is enough. We don't have to take this.

792
01:06:02,591 --> 01:06:04,616
I think it's Derek who's been taking it.

793
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:05,956
Shut up!

794
01:06:06,028 --> 01:06:08,792
Marshak, you do have to take it.

795
01:06:09,765 --> 01:06:13,565
You're not skiing in the final competition.
And that's final.

796
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:18,137
Okay, when you say final, do you mean
you are finally finished speaking?

797
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:20,471
Okay. Finals.
No one told me about a test.

798
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:23,444
Test? Does that mean
we have to cram, Derek?

799
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:29,316
Wait a minute. You have made
a mockery out of me and my mountain.

800
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:32,548
And I'm not going to have the future
of this facility go down in flames

801
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:35,556
because of you
and your juvenile hall antics.

802
01:06:35,624 --> 01:06:37,956
There's a lot of important people
here today.

803
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:41,622
It kind of breaks my heart to know
that you won't be around to meet them.

804
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:43,289
Class dismissed.

805
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:48,261
Okay, you may be able to disqualify us

806
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:51,830
but you cannot stop us
from doing the lambada.

807
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:56,870
That's the forbidden dance.

808
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:01,382
- I think it's time we leave.
- I think it is time we leave.

809
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:03,350
It's getting really hot in here.

810
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:05,979
Boy. We must discuss the Paulette scene.

811
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:08,387
Now, was she wearing socks
when you saw her body?

812
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:31,776
You guys gotta quit your bellyaching,
you know what I mean?

813
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:33,838
"I can't ski... "

814
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:37,278
Guys, we gotta do something.

815
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:41,920
Maybe partying isn't the answer.

816
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:49,321
No.

817
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,728
You guys know
what I'm talking about, huh?

818
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:57,068
Skiing is partying. Partying is skiing.

819
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:04,806
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

820
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:12,881
They can't stop us from partying,
so they can't stop us from skiing.

821
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:16,724
Johnny's right. And thank you, Fitz.

822
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:20,958
Wait a second.
I've lost, like, far too many brain cells

823
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:22,588
to understand that one.

824
01:08:22,665 --> 01:08:25,725
What the boys are saying is, if you can't
bring the mountain to the party,

825
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:27,530
you bring the party to the mountain.

826
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:30,401
- Right!
- We crash the competition.

827
01:08:37,146 --> 01:08:38,636
He's learning.

828
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:40,212
Lambada.

829
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:49,589
<i>Qualifying rounds are over</i>

830
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:53,025
<i>and it's time for the annual
Spring Ski-fest Competition to begin.</i>

831
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:56,890
<i>The top ten qualifying skiers will compete
in the slalom,</i>

832
01:08:57,032 --> 01:08:59,967
<i>giant slalom, freestyle and the downhill.</i>

833
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:02,634
Mr. Bryce.

834
01:09:03,005 --> 01:09:04,233
<i>Seedings are completed.</i>

835
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:07,639
<i>Defending champion Reid Janssen
is top seed in every event.</i>

836
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:10,941
<i>Newcomer John Roland, who impressed
everybody with a second-place seeding,</i>

837
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:14,915
<i>has been disqualified
along with the entire Section 8 squad.</i>

838
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:19,383
Well, Reid, looks like I'm gonna get
my piece of action after all.

839
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:22,784
You're gonna get yours too.

840
01:09:33,035 --> 01:09:34,832
What the hell's that?

841
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:42,870
What the fuck is this?

842
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:53,285
Yeah!

843
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:31,089
Reid, just what the hell is going on?

844
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:43,132
Gentlemen, may I present to you
Section 8.

845
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:46,034
- Hi.
- What the hell do you think you're doing?

846
01:10:46,108 --> 01:10:48,576
Well, we came here to ski.

847
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:51,538
- I came here to ski.
- You gotta be kidding, Marshak.

848
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:54,139
Your group is bottom of the barrel.

849
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:56,842
Even if they let you race, you...

850
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,386
What do you say?

851
01:10:58,454 --> 01:11:01,480
Let them ski! Let them ski!
Let them ski!

852
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:03,957
Let them ski! Let them ski! Let them ski!

853
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:05,152
Yeah!

854
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:08,592
Ski! Ski! Ski! Ski! Ski! Ski! Ski!

855
01:11:08,831 --> 01:11:10,298
Let them ski!

856
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:14,970
Reid, hold on a minute.

857
01:11:15,371 --> 01:11:18,772
There are other things to consider here,
you know what I mean?

858
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:23,535
Marshak, why don't we say this?

859
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:27,472
You agree to calm down your antics,

860
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:29,312
we'll let you participate
in the competition.

861
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:31,012
It's a done deal.

862
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:34,450
- "Calm down our antics"?
- "Calm down our antics"?

863
01:11:34,523 --> 01:11:36,957
- We're gonna embarrass you.
- Really?

864
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:52,398
<i>Section 8
is back in the competition</i>

865
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:53,941
<i>and they're making the most of it,</i>

866
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:56,000
<i>quickly moving up to fourth place.</i>

867
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:24,431
They're a bunch of pussies.

868
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:26,731
<i>Section 8 is making
a run for the team cup,</i>

869
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:29,300
<i>but the downhill is
First Section's strongest event</i>

870
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:31,141
<i>and that's up next.</i>

871
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:34,407
Man, this is bullshit.

872
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:37,748
We own this event.
Let's blow these geeks off the hill.

873
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,285
No kidding.

874
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:43,487
- Honorary dance for the girls?
- Definitely.

875
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:47,222
Millie. Millie. Millie. Millie. Millie.
Hi, Millie.

876
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:53,096
We own this race.
You don't stand a chance.

877
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:55,901
Helicopter.

878
01:12:57,606 --> 01:13:00,097
Helicopter, yeah!

879
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:08,275
Well, all righty. Hi, how are you?

880
01:13:10,352 --> 01:13:14,049
Yes! Helmet. Yellow, not my color.

881
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:20,623
In order to be the best,
you must lose your mind.

882
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:25,366
Get out of here, you slimes.

883
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:30,068
You've learned much, young Dave,
but you are not a skier yet.

884
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:35,440
<i>Section 8 is still far behind,</i>

885
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:38,002
<i>so they're going to have to come up
with something really special</i>

886
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,412
<i>if they truly want to win.</i>

887
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:35,599
Hey, are you all right?

888
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:11,102
<i>Section 8's chance
has come down to John Roland.</i>

889
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,538
<i>He needs to beat the time
of two minutes, 22 seconds</i>

890
01:15:13,709 --> 01:15:15,939
<i>for Section 8 to win the team competition.</i>

891
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:21,279
<i>The course record,
shown on the lower clock, is 2:24,</i>

892
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:23,443
<i>so it doesn't look good.</i>

893
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:47,837
Come on!

894
01:15:55,584 --> 01:15:57,176
Come on, Johnny!

895
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:17,795
<i>2.2, a new course record,</i>

896
01:16:18,173 --> 01:16:20,471
<i>but it's not enough for Section 8 to win.</i>

897
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:24,603
<i>It's a tie. Dave's section
and Reid's section are tied.</i>

898
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:27,911
Johnny boy! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny!

899
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:32,278
- All right! All right!
- He's the man! That was really something!

900
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:39,193
Hey, Marshak.

901
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:41,157
You call what you did "skiing"?

902
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:43,663
Actually I call what we did
"kicking your ass. "

903
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:47,099
- Yeah, well, it's not over. You didn't win.
- Okay.

904
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:50,602
- Let's settle this once and for all.
- Right.

905
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:52,864
The best against the best.
What do you say?

906
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:54,101
Sure.

907
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:57,269
Only... Shall we make this
a little more interesting?

908
01:16:57,346 --> 01:16:59,746
Say loser walks off the mountain
and never looks back?

909
01:16:59,815 --> 01:17:02,750
Sure, and we ski the Dome.

910
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:04,578
Dave!

911
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:06,584
- The Dome?
- Of course.

912
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:11,053
Agreed.

913
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,894
Though I must say I'm a little surprised.

914
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:16,829
You and me on the Dome. That's great.

915
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:19,731
Oh, the decision was easy.
Johnny's gonna ski.

916
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:21,291
All right, Johnny.
Way to go, Johnny!

917
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:23,838
All right, John!
Way to go!

918
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:27,341
Yeah. Remember? Loser walks. No tears.

919
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:32,040
Sending the lamb
to the slaughter, Marshak.

920
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:35,508
First-timer on the Dome. Can't wait.

921
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:39,287
- I'll see you up there.
- You'll see the back of me.

922
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:46,461
Okay, Johnny, the only thing you
have to remember about skiing the Dome

923
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:49,691
is when you get to the Bald Rock there...

924
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:52,233
There, do not take the slope to the right.

925
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,393
It ends in a cliff.
It's a totally impossible jump.

926
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:57,063
No one has ever made it, so just...
You forget about it.

927
01:17:57,139 --> 01:17:59,869
Take the slope to the left at Bald Rock.
Left at Bald Rock.

928
01:17:59,941 --> 01:18:01,602
- You got it?
- Left at Bald Rock. Got it.

929
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:02,666
Left.

930
01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:04,177
- Exactly.
- Right.

931
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:10,675
Hope he's okay.

932
01:18:14,322 --> 01:18:16,313
<i>The skiers will be dropped
at the summit.</i>

933
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:19,224
<i>Then it's a free-for-all to the bottom.</i>

934
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:22,516
Where are they?

935
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:42,035
<i>The first one past Bald Rock
will have the clear advantage.</i>

936
01:20:42,103 --> 01:20:44,435
<i>- So whoever appears first should win.
- Come on, Johnny.</i>

937
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:45,768
Come on!

938
01:21:07,128 --> 01:21:10,222
- It's Reid. Where's Johnny?
- I don't know.

939
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:11,424
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

940
01:21:11,499 --> 01:21:14,627
<i>I don't believe it.
Roland's going towards the cliff.</i>

941
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:16,034
<i>He must be out of his mind.</i>

942
01:21:19,941 --> 01:21:21,135
Oh, no!

943
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:27,605
Check this out.

944
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:39,818
Come on, Johnny!

945
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:43,693
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

946
01:21:49,537 --> 01:21:52,131
Gentlemen, the mountain is ours!

947
01:21:56,878 --> 01:21:58,175
<i>He did it!</i>

948
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:00,146
<i>John Roland is the winner.</i>

949
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:02,945
<i>Section 8 wins the team competition.</i>

950
01:22:06,154 --> 01:22:08,554
Yeah! Victory!

951
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:13,621
Yeah!

952
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:20,424
I think you're about to be crushed.

953
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:28,568
Hey, I don't care, Reid.
They're still a bunch of dickheads.

954
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:29,972
Shut up.

955
01:22:31,646 --> 01:22:33,546
Way to be, Johnny!

956
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:42,186
I wouldn't get too carried away
with your celebrating, Marshak.

957
01:22:42,257 --> 01:22:45,556
You see, right now,
there's a new party in control.

958
01:22:45,894 --> 01:22:47,885
I know. I know.

959
01:22:48,363 --> 01:22:51,389
<i>- Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny!
Hold on a minute.</i>

960
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:56,062
<i>The mountain has been sold.
I repeat, the mountain has been sold.</i>

961
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:57,502
<i>According to this press release,</i>

962
01:22:57,572 --> 01:23:00,939
<i>the new management
promises radical restructuring.</i>

963
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:04,441
"Radical restructuring"?
I didn't write that.

964
01:23:11,886 --> 01:23:15,413
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you radical restructuring.

965
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:17,115
How about the beers?

966
01:23:19,294 --> 01:23:21,194
May I present your new owner.

967
01:23:21,262 --> 01:23:23,321
The mountain is ours!

968
01:23:23,398 --> 01:23:26,697
Yeah, okay, yeah!
- All right! Yeah, okay!

969
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:31,134
Yeah, all right, okay.
Okay. Okay. Okay.

970
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,035
Anybody got a problem with that?

971
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:35,599
No! No! No!
- No! No! No!

972
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:37,474
Then let's get naked.

973
01:23:37,545 --> 01:23:39,376
Oh, yeah!
Yeah.

974
01:23:50,925 --> 01:23:54,053
This is radical restructuring!

975
01:23:56,498 --> 01:24:00,958
It's simple. If you wanna be the best,
you've got to party with the best.

976
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:11,376
Know it, live it, love it.

977
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:32,292
Are you ready for a hot tub?

978
01:24:38,606 --> 01:24:40,335
I love my life.

979
01:25:00,895 --> 01:25:03,022
Welcome to my kingdom.
