288
00:25:29,746 --> 00:25:36,185
I asked hlm to come because... it appears
you have... a rather rare blood dlsorder.

- What´s golng on?

295
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:04,696
Burt, you have a dlsease
known as... autotoxla haematosa.

296
00:26:04,786 --> 00:26:07,664
The common name is wexler´s curtaln.

297
00:26:07,746 --> 00:26:10,624
It´s a progresslve blood dlsorder.

298
00:26:10,706 --> 00:26:15,905
The lymphatlc system attacks the red
blood cells, mlstaklng them for a vlrus.

299
00:26:15,986 --> 00:26:18,944
- It´s very rare.
- Yeah?

300
00:26:19,026 --> 00:26:23,099
As the dlsease progresses,
the ilnlng of the cells weakens...

301
00:26:23,186 --> 00:26:28,977
...and can no longer oxygenate the body.
Thls, of course, includes the braln.

Well...

303
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:34,178
- of course.
- As the deprlvatlon becomes...

304
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:36,222
...more pronounced...

305
00:26:36,306 --> 00:26:39,901

306

...llterally suffocatlng
from the lack of oxygen.

307
00:26:43,946 --> 00:26:48,781
The entlre process takes about...
two and a half weeks.

308

Termlnal?

312
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:05,335
I often don´t tell patlents, because there´s
nothlng they can do. But in your case...

313
00:27:05,426 --> 00:27:09,942
...the progresslon is so rapld,
i thought you mlght need a chance...

314
00:27:10,026 --> 00:27:12,256
...to get your affalrs in order.

I hate to have to tell you thls, burt.

324

And when dougle was belng born, i made
the nurse let me stand in the doorway...

623
00:53:27,226 --> 00:53:31,378
...so i could hear that you were all rlght.

624

And... when you were taklng
those drawlng classes...

625
00:53:39,026 --> 00:53:42,985
...and you´d come home and throw away
some of your plctures?

626
00:53:43,266 --> 00:53:47,703
I plcked those plctures out of
the garbage... and i put ´em in a drawer.

627
00:53:51,866 --> 00:53:54,699

...or why he made you call hlm peter

You know, you just take
