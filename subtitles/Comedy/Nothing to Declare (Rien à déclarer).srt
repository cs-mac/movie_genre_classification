1
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:42,301
"Sing no more ditties,"

2
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,197
More!

3
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:48,436
"Sing no more,

4
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:56,046
Of dumps so dull and heavy,

5
00:01:58,983 --> 00:02:03,921
The fraud of men was ever so,

6
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,625
Since summer. . .

7
00:02:09,694 --> 00:02:13,152
first was leafy.

8
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,592
Then sigh not so,

9
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:20,669
But let them go,

10
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:25,300
And be you blithe. . .

11
00:02:25,377 --> 00:02:27,812
and bonny,

12
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,881
Converting all . . .

13
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,045
your sounds of woe,

14
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,746
Into Hey. . .

15
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,289
nonny, nonny !''

16
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,935
My lord.

17
00:02:58,877 --> 00:03:01,745
I learn in this letter. . .

18
00:03:01,812 --> 00:03:04,610
that Don Pedro of Aragon. . .

19
00:03:04,682 --> 00:03:07,682
comes this night to Messina !

20
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,187
He is very near by this.

21
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,693
He was not three leagues off
when l left him.

22
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,762
How many gentlemen
have you lost in this action ?

23
00:03:17,895 --> 00:03:19,895
But few of any sort, and none of name.

24
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:25,163
I find here that Don Pedro
hath bestowed much honor. . .

25
00:03:25,236 --> 00:03:27,967
on a young Florentine
called Claudio.

26
00:03:30,842 --> 00:03:31,842
He hath borne himself. . .

27
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,579
beyond the promise of his age,

28
00:03:34,145 --> 00:03:36,145
doing in the figure of a lamb,
the feats of a lion !

29
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:42,378
Is Signior Mountanto
returned from the wars or no ?

30
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:43,455
I know not that name, lady.

31
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:47,021
My cousin means
Signior Benedick of Padua.

32
00:03:47,758 --> 00:03:49,758
O, he's returned;
and as pleasant as ever he was.

33
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,430
I pray you, how many hath he
killed and eaten in these wars ?

34
00:03:54,532 --> 00:03:55,532
But how many hath he killed ?

35
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:59,502
For indeed l promised to eat
all of his killing.

36
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,006
He hath done good service.
And a good soldier too, lady.

37
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,137
And a good soldier to a lady.

38
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,336
But what is he to a lord ?

39
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:12,413
A lord to a lord, a man to a man;
stuffed with all honorable virtues.

40
00:04:12,883 --> 00:04:15,012
It is so, indeed:

41
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:17,086
he is no less than a stuffed man.

42
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,290
You must not, sir,
mistake my niece.

43
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:24,627
There is a kind of merry war
betwixt Signior Benedick and her:

44
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:28,163
they never meet but there's a skirmish
of wit between them.

45
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:30,634
Who is his companion now ?

46
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,170
He hath every month
a new sworn brother.

47
00:04:34,406 --> 00:04:36,606
He is most in the company
of the right noble Claudio.

48
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,504
Oh, Lord !

49
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,579
He will hang upon him like a disease.

50
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:46,615
He is sooner caught than the pestilence,
and the taker runs presently mad !

51
00:04:46,951 --> 00:04:49,951
God help the noble Claudio !
If he have caught the Benedick,

52
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,857
it will cost him a thousand pounds
ere a' be cured.

53
00:04:54,326 --> 00:04:57,326
I will keep friends with you, lady.

54
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,629
Do, good friend.

55
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,032
You will never run mad, niece.

56
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,098
No, not till a hot January.

57
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,406
Don Pedro is approaching !

58
00:09:23,961 --> 00:09:27,961
Good Signior Leonato,
are you come to meet your trouble ?

59
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:31,134
The fashion of the world
is to avoid cost, and you encounter it.

60
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:35,504
Never came trouble to my house
in the likeness of Your Grace.

61
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,350
My lord.

62
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,118
I think this is your daughter.

63
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:56,192
Her mother hath many times
told me so.

64
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,463
Were you in doubt, sir,
that you asked her ?

65
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:02,062
Signior Benedick, no !

66
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:06,735
If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not
have his head on her shoulders. . .

67
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,839
for all Messina,
as like him as she is.

68
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:13,139
I wonder that you will still
be talking, Signior Benedick. Nobody marks you.

69
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,510
What, my dear Lady Disdain !

70
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,240
Are you yet living ?

71
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,817
Is it possible Disdain should die. . .

72
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:23,317
while she hath such meet food
to feed it as Signior Benedick ?

73
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,309
Courtesy itself must convert to Disdain
if you come in her presence.

74
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,692
Then is Courtesy a turncoat.

75
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,260
But it is certain l am loved of all ladies,
only you excepted;

76
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,730
and l would l could find in my heart that l had not
a hard heart; for truly, l love none.

77
00:10:37,034 --> 00:10:41,034
A dear happiness to women: they would 
else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor.

78
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,840
I thank God and my cold blood,
l am of your humour for that.

79
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,375
I had rather hear my dog
bark at a crow. . .

80
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,913
than a man swear he loves me.

81
00:10:49,346 --> 00:10:51,346
God keep your ladyship in that mind . . .

82
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,484
so some gentlemen or other shall 'scape
a pre-destinate scratched face.

83
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,157
Scratching could not make it worse
an 't such a face as yours were.

84
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,695
Well, you are a rare parrot teacher.

85
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,964
A bird of my tongue
is better than a beast of yours.

86
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:09,231
I would my horse had the speed
of your tongue ! But. . .

87
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:13,067
keep you away, i' God 's name.
I have done.

88
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,673
You always end with a jade's trick.

89
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,971
I know you of old.

90
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,046
Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick,

91
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:25,447
my dear friend Leonato
hath invited you all.

92
00:11:25,582 --> 00:11:28,082
I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month.

93
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,161
Let me bid you welcome, my lord:

94
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:46,701
being reconciled to the prince
your brother,

95
00:11:47,404 --> 00:11:49,168
I owe you all duty.

96
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,966
I thank you.

97
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:58,043
I am not of many words,
but l thank you.

98
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,356
Please it Your Grace lead on ?

99
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,725
Your hand, Leonato;
we will go together.

100
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,206
Benedick,

101
00:12:24,274 --> 00:12:26,612
didst thou note the daughter
of Signior Leonato ?

102
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,912
I noted her not,
but l looked on her.

103
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,480
Is she not a modest young lady ?

104
00:12:31,716 --> 00:12:34,716
Do you question me for my simple,
true judgment ?

105
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,820
Or would you have me speak after
my custom, as a tyrant to their sex ?

106
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,591
No; I pray thee, speak
in sober judgment.

107
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,427
Why, i' faith, methinks
she's too low for a high praise,

108
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:47,596
too brown for a fair praise,
and too little for a great praise.

109
00:12:47,932 --> 00:12:49,232
Only this commendation
l can afford her,

110
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,419
That were she other than she is,
she were unhandsome;

111
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,371
and being no other than as she is,
l do not like her.

112
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:59,407
Thou thinkest l am in sport.
I pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her.

113
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,778
Would you buy her
that you inquire after her ?

114
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,114
Can the world buy such a jewel ?

115
00:13:04,548 --> 00:13:07,346
Yea, and a case to put it into.

116
00:13:07,418 --> 00:13:09,418
But speak you this
with a sad brow ?

117
00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:17,793
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady
that ever l looked on.

118
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,532
I can see yet without spectacles
and l see no such matter.

119
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,869
There's her cousin,

120
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:28,937
and she were not possessed
with a Fury, exceeds her. . .

121
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:31,775
as much in beauty as the first of May
doth the last of December.

122
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:36,677
But l hope you have no intent
to turn husband, have you ?

123
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:39,099
I would scarce trust myself,

124
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,350
though l had sworn the contrary,

125
00:13:43,254 --> 00:13:45,554
if Hero would be my wife.

126
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:51,325
Is't come to this ? Shall l never see
a bachelor of threescore again ?

127
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:52,596
Gentlemen,

128
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,066
what secret hath held you here
that you followed not to Leonato's ?

129
00:13:58,135 --> 00:14:00,128
He is "in love".

130
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,240
'With who ?'
That is Your Grace's part.

131
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:08,009
With Hero, Leonato's short daughter.

132
00:14:08,178 --> 00:14:10,878
Amen if you love her;
for the lady is very well worthy.

133
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:12,649
You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.

134
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:14,301
By my troth,
l speak my thought.

135
00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:16,236
And in faith, my lord,
l spoke mine.

136
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,522
And, by my two faiths and troths,
my lord, l spoke mine.

137
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,125
- That l love her, l feel.
 - That she is worthy, l know.

138
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,528
That l neither feel how she should be loved
nor know how she should be worthy,

139
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,764
is the opinion that fire cannot melt
out of me.

140
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,067
I will die in it at the stake.

141
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:33,033
Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic
in the despite of beauty.

142
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:36,538
That a woman conceived me,
l thank her;

143
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:40,442
that she brought me up,
l likewise give her most humble thanks.

144
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:45,278
But that l will hang my bugle
in an invisible baldric,

145
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,218
all women shall pardon me.

146
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,884
I will live a bachelor.

147
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,955
I shall see thee, ere l die,
look pale with love.

148
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:58,158
With anger, with sickness or with hunger,
my lord. Not with love.

149
00:14:58,428 --> 00:15:00,428
Well, as time shall try !

150
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,633
"In time the savage bull
doth bear the yoke."

151
00:15:04,668 --> 00:15:07,168
The savage bull may;
but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it,

152
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:09,538
pluck off the bull's horns
and set them in my forehead !

153
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,875
And let me be vilely painted
and in such great letters as they write !

154
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:14,399
''Here is good horse to hire."

155
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:19,251
Let them signify under my sign "here you may
see Benedick the married man.''

156
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:23,951
Benedick, repair to Leonato's:

157
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:28,221
tell him l will not fail him at supper;
for indeed he hath made great preparation.

158
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,894
Examine your conscience.
And so l leave you.

159
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,267
Hath Leonato any son, my lord ?

160
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:40,769
No child but Hero,
she's his only heir.

161
00:15:42,105 --> 00:15:45,105
Dost thou affect her, Claudio ?

162
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,413
 O, my lord, when you went onward
on this ended action,

163
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,250
I looked upon her with a soldier's eye,
that liked,

164
00:15:54,985 --> 00:15:58,985
but had a rougher task in hand than to drive
liking to the name of love.

165
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:02,316
But now. . .

166
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,821
I am returned and that war thoughts
have left their places vacant,

167
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,899
in their rooms come thronging soft. . .

168
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:13,201
and delicate desires,

169
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,272
all prompting me
how fair young Hero is.

170
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:17,975
Saying. . .

171
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,714
I liked her ere l went to wars.

172
00:16:25,115 --> 00:16:30,115
Thou wilt be like a lover presently and
tire the hearer with a book of words.

173
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,322
If thou dost love fair Hero,
cherish it,

174
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:36,591
and I will break with her and with
her father and thou shalt have her.

175
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:39,495
I know we shall have revelling tonight.

176
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:44,731
I will assume thy part in some disguise
and tell fair Hero l am Claudio,

177
00:16:45,135 --> 00:16:48,135
and in her bosom
l 'll unclasp my heart. . .

178
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:53,407
and take her hearing prisoner with the
force and strong encounter of my amorous tale;

179
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,279
then after to her father
will l break;

180
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,449
and the conclusion is,

181
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,880
she shall be thine !

182
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:07,057
In practise let us put it presently.

183
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,566
What the good year, my lord ?

184
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:20,434
Why are you thus out of measure sad ?

185
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,240
There is no measure
in the occasion that breeds;

186
00:17:27,144 --> 00:17:30,144
therefore the sadness is without limit.

187
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:32,444
You should hear reason.

188
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,219
And when I have heard it,

189
00:17:37,288 --> 00:17:39,414
what blessing brings it ?

190
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,595
I cannot hide what l am.

191
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:47,862
I must be sad when l have cause
and smile at no man's jests;

192
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,200
eat when l have stomach
and wait for no man's leisure;

193
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:57,605
sleep when l am drowsy
and tend on no man's business;

194
00:17:57,741 --> 00:18:00,741
Iaugh when l am merry. . .

195
00:18:01,211 --> 00:18:03,211
and claw no man in his humor.

196
00:18:06,616 --> 00:18:09,672
Yea, but you must not
make the full show of this. . .

197
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,922
till you may do so
without controlment.

198
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,058
You have of late stood out
against your brother,

199
00:18:15,358 --> 00:18:17,358
and he hath ta'en you newly
into his grace,

200
00:18:17,828 --> 00:18:20,228
where it is impossible
you should take true root. . .

201
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,899
but by the fair weather
that you make yourself.

202
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,535
I had rather be a canker
in a hedge. . .

203
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,438
than a rose in his grace.

204
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:32,807
In this, though l cannot be said
to be a flattering honest man,

205
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,510
it must not be denied
but l am a plain-dealing villain !

206
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,949
If l had my mouth,

207
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,512
I would bite;

208
00:18:41,586 --> 00:18:45,586
if l had my liberty,
l would do my liking.

209
00:18:46,057 --> 00:18:50,057
In the meantime
let me be that l am . . .

210
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,662
and seek not to alter me.

211
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:58,932
Borachio, what news ?

212
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:03,605
I can give you intelligence
of an intended marriage.

213
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,057
Will it serve for any model
to build mischief on ?

214
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,310
Marry, it is
your brother's right hand.

215
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:13,582
The most exquisite Claudio ?

216
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:16,001
- Even he.
- How came you to this ?

217
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,413
I heard it agreed upon. . .

218
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,840
that the prince
should woo Hero for himself,

219
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,990
and having obtained her,

220
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:25,050
give her to Count Claudio.

221
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:27,663
Come, come, let us thither.

222
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:29,932
This may prove food to my displeasure.

223
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:34,701
That young start-up
hath all the glory of my overthrow.

224
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:37,038
If l can cross him any way,

225
00:19:37,674 --> 00:19:40,674
I bless myself every way.

226
00:19:40,778 --> 00:19:43,478
You are both sure,
and will assist me ?

227
00:19:44,714 --> 00:19:46,014
To the death, my lord.

228
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,850
Shall we go prove
what's to be done ?

229
00:19:49,252 --> 00:19:51,117
We'll wait upon your lordship.

230
00:20:16,346 --> 00:20:19,346
- Was not Count John here at supper ?
- I saw him not.

231
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:24,317
How tartly that gentleman looks ! I never can see 
him but l am heart-burned an hour after.

232
00:20:24,588 --> 00:20:26,288
He is of a very melancholy disposition.

233
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,940
He were an excellent man. . .

234
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,040
that were made just in the midway
between him and Benedick.

235
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,510
The one is too like an image
and says nothing,

236
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:54,681
and the other too like my lady's
eldest son, evermore tattling.

237
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,320
Then half Signior Benedick's tongue. . .

238
00:20:57,855 --> 00:20:59,255
in Count John's mouth,

239
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:04,691
and half Count John's melancholy
in Signior Benedick's face.

240
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:07,193
With a good leg. . .

241
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:09,663
and a good foot, Uncle,

242
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:11,733
and money enough in his purse,

243
00:21:12,403 --> 00:21:17,141
such a man would win any woman in the
world if he could get her goodwill.

244
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:21,761
By my troth, niece,
thou wilt never get thee a husband,

245
00:21:22,011 --> 00:21:24,011
if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.

246
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:33,053
Lord, l could not endure a husband with
a beard on his face. I had rather lie in the woollen.

247
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,691
You may light on a husband
that hath no beard.

248
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,461
What should l do with him ?

249
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,729
Dress him in my apparel
and make him my waiting-gentlewoman ?

250
00:21:41,731 --> 00:21:44,731
He that hath a beard
is more than a youth,

251
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,970
and he that hath no beard
is less than a man.

252
00:21:47,404 --> 00:21:49,404
And he that is more than a youth
is not for me,

253
00:21:49,606 --> 00:21:51,106
and he that is less than a man,

254
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,666
I am not for him.

255
00:21:53,743 --> 00:21:55,743
In faith, she's too curst.

256
00:21:56,012 --> 00:21:57,741
Well, then, go you into hell ?

257
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,510
No, but to the gate;

258
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,585
and there will the devil meet me
like an old cuckold . . .

259
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:05,304
with horns on his head,
and saying. . .

260
00:22:05,588 --> 00:22:08,088
''Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to heaven;

261
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,393
here's no place for you maids.''

262
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,595
So, away to Saint Peter for the heavens;

263
00:22:13,897 --> 00:22:17,897
he shows me where the bachelors sit,

264
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:22,569
and there live we
as merry as the day is long.

265
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:27,076
Well, niece. l hope you will
be ruled by your father.

266
00:22:27,243 --> 00:22:30,493
Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty
to make curtsy and say,

267
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,780
''Father, as it please you,''
but yet for all that, cousin,

268
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,086
Iet him be a handsome fellow.

269
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:40,555
Or else make another curtsy and say,
''Father, as it please me.''

270
00:22:46,096 --> 00:22:50,096
Daughter, remember what l told you:

271
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,436
if the prince do solicit you
in that kind,

272
00:22:55,673 --> 00:22:56,973
you know your answer.

273
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:06,564
Well, niece. l hope to see you
one day fitted with a husband.

274
00:23:06,817 --> 00:23:08,817
Not till God make men. . .

275
00:23:09,185 --> 00:23:11,335
of some other metal than earth.

276
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:13,823
Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.

277
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:18,092
I have a good eye, Uncle;
I can see a church by daylight.

278
00:23:21,865 --> 00:23:23,767
The revellers are entering !

279
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:38,979
Lady, will you walk about
with your friend ?

280
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,941
I know you well enough;
you are Signior Antonio.

281
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:07,930
At a word, l am not.

282
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,180
I know you by the waggling
of your head.

283
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:14,317
- At a word, l am not !
- Come, come,

284
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:18,586
do you think l do not know you
by your excellent wit ?

285
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,824
Can virtue hide itself ?

286
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,092
Go to, mum, you are he:

287
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:26,462
graces will appear,
and there's an end.

288
00:24:31,501 --> 00:24:34,551
...Well, l would you did like me.

289
00:24:34,838 --> 00:24:36,888
So would not l,
for l have many ill qualities.

290
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,542
- Which is one ?
- I say my prayers aloud.

291
00:24:44,615 --> 00:24:46,315
Will you not tell me who told you so ?

292
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,085
No, you shall pardon me.

293
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:51,519
- Nor will you not tell me who you are ?
- Not now.

294
00:24:52,423 --> 00:24:53,823
That l was disdainful,

295
00:24:54,424 --> 00:24:59,424
and that l had my good wit
out of the ''Hundred Merry Tales''

296
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,326
well, this was Signior Benedick that said so.

297
00:25:01,432 --> 00:25:03,401
What's he ?

298
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,200
I 'm sure you know him well enough.

299
00:25:05,502 --> 00:25:07,802
Not l, believe me.

300
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,523
- Did he never make you laugh ?
- I pray you. . .

301
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:12,970
what is he ?

302
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:16,912
Why, he is the prince's jester.

303
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,675
A very dull fool.

304
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:22,250
His only gift is in devising
impossible slanders.

305
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:27,054
None but libertines delight in him;
for he both pleases men and angers them,

306
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:30,392
and then they laugh at him
and beat him.

307
00:25:32,262 --> 00:25:34,698
I am sure he is in the fleet.

308
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,766
I would he had boarded me.

309
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,350
When l know the gentleman,
l 'll tell him what you say.

310
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,435
Do,

311
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:47,709
Do.

312
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:51,679
- We must follow the leaders.
- In every good thing.

313
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,980
Are not you Signior Benedick ?

314
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:27,584
You know me well, I am he.

315
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,919
Signior, you are very near my brother
in his love:

316
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,823
he is enamored on Hero.

317
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:37,391
I pray you dissuade him from her:
she is no equal for his birth.

318
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:40,791
How know you he loves her ?

319
00:26:40,897 --> 00:26:42,865
I heard him swear his affection.

320
00:26:42,932 --> 00:26:45,932
So did l too; and he swore
he would marry her tonight.

321
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,571
Come, let us to the banquet.

322
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,784
Thus answer l in the name of Benedick,

323
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:06,487
but hear these ill news
with the ears of Claudio.

324
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,490
'Tis certain so:

325
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,999
the prince woos for himself !

326
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:22,501
Friendship is constant
in all other things. . .

327
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,739
save in the office and affairs
of love.

328
00:27:29,512 --> 00:27:31,512
This is an accident of hourly proof,

329
00:27:32,182 --> 00:27:34,182
which l mistrusted not.

330
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,152
Farewell, therefore, Hero !

331
00:27:43,993 --> 00:27:44,825
Count Claudio ?

332
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,546
- Yea, the same.
- Come, will you go with me ?

333
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:48,798
- Whither ?
- About your own business.

334
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,667
The prince hath got your Hero !

335
00:27:51,934 --> 00:27:53,596
I wish him joy of her !

336
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,672
Did you think that the prince
would have served you thus ?

337
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,039
I pray you, leave me !

338
00:27:58,041 --> 00:28:00,603
Alas, poor hurt fowl.

339
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:07,314
But that my Lady Beatrice
should know me, and not know me !

340
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:10,848
The prince's fool ! Ha ?

341
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:13,220
I am not so reputed.

342
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:15,889
It is the base, though bitter, disposition
of Beatrice. . .

343
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:20,161
that puts the world into her person,
and so gives me out.

344
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:24,699
Well, l 'll be revenged as l may.

345
00:28:26,202 --> 00:28:28,802
- Now, signior, where's the count ?
- Troth, my lord, l found him here. . .

346
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,074
as melancholy as a lodge in a warren.

347
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:33,192
I told him,
and l think l told him true,

348
00:28:33,443 --> 00:28:37,443
that Your Grace had got the good will
of this young lady.

349
00:28:37,647 --> 00:28:39,647
The Lady Beatrice
hath a quarrel to you.

350
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:44,550
The gentleman that danced with her
told her she is much wronged by you.

351
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:48,689
O, she misused me
past the endurance of a block !

352
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,027
She told me,
not thinking l had been myself,

353
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,596
that l was the prince's jester,

354
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:56,632
that l was duller than a great thaw,

355
00:28:56,968 --> 00:29:00,068
huddling jest upon jest with such
impossible conveyance upon me. . .

356
00:29:00,336 --> 00:29:04,336
that l stood like a man at a mark,
with a whole army shooting at me.

357
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,567
She speaks poniards,

358
00:29:07,644 --> 00:29:10,045
and every word stabs.

359
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,765
If her breath were as terrible as her
terminations, there were no living near her;

360
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:15,049
she would infect to the North Star !

361
00:29:15,586 --> 00:29:17,487
So, indeed, all disquiet,

362
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:20,555
horror, and perturbation follows her.

363
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:22,492
Look, here she comes.

364
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:27,861
Will Your Grace command me
any service to the world 's end ?

365
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,018
I will go on the slightest errand . . .

366
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,461
now to the Antipodes. . .

367
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:34,237
that you can devise to send me on.

368
00:29:34,538 --> 00:29:38,738
I will fetch you a hair
off the Great Cham's beard,

369
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:42,009
do you any embassage to the Pigmies,

370
00:29:42,578 --> 00:29:47,278
rather than hold three words' conference
with this harpy.

371
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,220
You have no employment for me ?

372
00:29:51,454 --> 00:29:54,454
None, but to desire your good company !

373
00:29:55,692 --> 00:29:57,892
O, God, sir,
here's a dish l love not.

374
00:29:58,194 --> 00:30:01,094
I cannot endure my Lady Tongue !

375
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:07,318
Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart
of Signior Benedick.

376
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:09,005
Indeed, my lord,

377
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,342
he lent it me a while,

378
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,046
and l gave him use for it,

379
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:18,673
a double heart for his single one.

380
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:24,416
Marry, once before he won it of me,
with false dice,

381
00:30:24,855 --> 00:30:27,355
therefore Your Grace may well say
l have lost it.

382
00:30:27,857 --> 00:30:30,357
You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.

383
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:33,815
So l would not he should do me,
my lord,

384
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:36,065
Iest l should prove the mother of fools.

385
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:41,367
I have brought Count Claudio,
whom you sent me to seek.

386
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:46,242
Why, how now, Count,
wherefore are you sad ?

387
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:49,009
- Not sad, my lord.
- How then ? Sick ?

388
00:30:49,346 --> 00:30:53,346
- Neither, my lord.
- The count is neither sad, nor sick,

389
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,250
nor merry, nor well,

390
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,855
but civil count,

391
00:30:59,722 --> 00:31:02,644
civil as an orange,
and something of that jealous complexion.

392
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,744
In faith, lady, l think your blazon
to be true,

393
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,997
though l 'll be sworn, if he be so,
his conceit is false.

394
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:12,130
Here, Claudio,

395
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:13,201
I have wooed in thy name,

396
00:31:15,471 --> 00:31:18,634
and fair Hero is won.

397
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,710
I have broke with her father
and his goodwill obtained.

398
00:31:22,346 --> 00:31:26,346
Name the day of marriage,
and God give thee joy.

399
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,719
Count, take of me my daughter,

400
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,688
and with her my fortunes.

401
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,191
His Grace hath made the match,

402
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,860
and all grace say Amen to it.

403
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:49,932
Speak, Count, 'tis your cue.

404
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,909
Silence is the perfectest herald of joy.

405
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:59,546
I were but little happy
if l could say how much.

406
00:31:59,682 --> 00:32:02,084
Lady,

407
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,153
as you are mine,

408
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:07,114
I am yours.

409
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:11,693
Speak, cousin !

410
00:32:12,762 --> 00:32:14,195
Or, if you cannot,

411
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,165
stop his mouth with a kiss,
and let not him speak, neither.

412
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:36,718
In faith, lady,
you have a merry heart.

413
00:32:37,153 --> 00:32:38,653
Yea, my lord, I thank it.

414
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:42,190
Poor fool, it keeps
on the windy side of care.

415
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:47,061
My cousin tells him in his ear
that he is in her heart.

416
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,332
And so she doth, cousin.

417
00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:57,338
Good lord, for alliance !

418
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,163
Thus goes everyone to the world
but l,

419
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,413
and l am sunburnt.

420
00:33:05,414 --> 00:33:08,914
I may sit in a corner
and cry "Heigh-ho for a husband."

421
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,421
Lady Beatrice,
l will get you one.

422
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,890
I would rather have one
of your father's getting.

423
00:33:15,692 --> 00:33:18,692
Hath Your Grace ne'er a brother
like you ?

424
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:22,663
Your father got excellent husbands,
if a maid could come by them.

425
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,967
Will you have me, lady ?

426
00:33:27,837 --> 00:33:29,337
No, my lord,

427
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:35,442
unless l might have another
for working days.

428
00:33:35,644 --> 00:33:37,644
Your Grace is too costly
to wear every day.

429
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:45,051
But I beseech Your Grace, pardon me. I was born
to speak all mirth and no matter.

430
00:33:49,058 --> 00:33:51,058
Your silence most offends me,

431
00:33:51,894 --> 00:33:53,644
and to be merry best becomes you;

432
00:33:53,896 --> 00:33:56,346
for out o' question,
you were born in a merry hour.

433
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:59,601
No, sure, my lord,

434
00:34:00,636 --> 00:34:01,636
my mother cried.

435
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:08,076
But then there was a star danced,

436
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,780
and under that was l born.

437
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,317
Cousins,

438
00:34:16,152 --> 00:34:18,782
God give you joy !

439
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:26,995
By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.

440
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:32,634
There's little of the melancholy element
in her, my lord.

441
00:34:33,003 --> 00:34:36,503
She is never sad but when she sleeps,
and not ever then;

442
00:34:36,773 --> 00:34:40,123
for l have heard my daughter say
she hath often dreamt of unhappiness. . .

443
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,411
and waked herself with laughing.

444
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,498
She cannot endure to hear tell
of a husband.

445
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,284
Oh, by no means.

446
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,120
She were an excellent wife
for Benedick.

447
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,758
If they were but a week married,
they would talk themselves mad.

448
00:34:58,228 --> 00:34:59,978
County Claudio,
when mean you to go to church ?

449
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:03,531
- Tomorrow, my lord.
- Not till Monday, my dear son,

450
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,800
which is hence a just seven-night,

451
00:35:06,536 --> 00:35:09,136
and a time too brief, too,
to have all things answer my mind.

452
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:12,707
I warrant thee, Claudio,
the time shall not go dully by us.

453
00:35:13,143 --> 00:35:16,343
I will in the interim
undertake one of Hercules' labors,

454
00:35:16,646 --> 00:35:19,246
which is to bring Signior Benedick
and the Lady Beatrice. . .

455
00:35:19,516 --> 00:35:23,016
into a mountain of affection
the one with the other.

456
00:35:23,987 --> 00:35:26,987
I would fain have it a match,
and l doubt not but to fashion it,

457
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,941
if you will but minister such assistance
as l shall give you direction.

458
00:35:30,193 --> 00:35:34,293
My lord, l am for you, though it cost me
ten nights' watchings.

459
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:37,115
- And l, my lord.
- And you too, gentle Hero ?

460
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:40,867
I will do any modest office, my lord,
to help my cousin to a good husband.

461
00:35:41,338 --> 00:35:45,438
If we can do this,
Cupid is no longer an archer;

462
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,710
his glory shall be ours,

463
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:50,112
for we are the only love-gods.

464
00:35:50,447 --> 00:35:52,247
Go with me,
and I will tell you my drift.

465
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,677
I do much wonder that one man,

466
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,980
seeing how much another man
is a fool . . .

467
00:36:25,282 --> 00:36:27,582
when he dedicates his behaviors
to love,

468
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,919
will, after he hath laughed
at such shallow follies in others,

469
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:36,190
become the argument of his own scorn
by falling in love.

470
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,463
And such a man is Claudio.

471
00:36:42,132 --> 00:36:47,132
I have known when there was no music
with him but the drum and the fife,

472
00:36:47,304 --> 00:36:50,304
and now had he rather hear
the tabor and the pipe.

473
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:53,641
I have known when he would have walked
ten mile afoot to see a good armor,

474
00:36:54,244 --> 00:36:59,244
and now will he lie ten nights awake
carving the fashion of a new doublet.

475
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:04,150
He was wont to speak plain and to
the purpose, like an honest man and a soldier,

476
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:08,056
and now is he turned orthography.

477
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:11,125
His words are
a very fantastical banquet,

478
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:13,127
just so many strange dishes.

479
00:37:14,931 --> 00:37:17,131
Well, may l be so converted,
and see with these eyes ?

480
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,400
I cannot tell.
I think not.

481
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:25,204
I will not be sworn but love
may transform me to an oyster,

482
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:28,426
but l 'll take my oath on it,
till he have made an oyster of me,

483
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,879
he shall never make me such a fool.

484
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:35,282
One woman is fair, yet l am well.
Another is wise, yet l am well.

485
00:37:35,385 --> 00:37:37,385
Another virtuous, yet l am well.

486
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:40,422
But till all graces be in one woman,

487
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:43,391
one woman shall not come in my grace.

488
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:49,364
Rich she shall be,
that's certain. Hmm.

489
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,067
Wise, or l 'll none.

490
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:54,068
Virtuous,
or l 'll never cheapen her.

491
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:57,572
Fair, or l 'll never look on her.

492
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:01,775
Mild, or come not near me.

493
00:38:01,911 --> 00:38:04,539
Of good discourse,

494
00:38:04,614 --> 00:38:06,614
an excellent musician.

495
00:38:07,717 --> 00:38:11,813
And her hair shall be. . .

496
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,856
of what colour it please God.

497
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,460
Ha ! The prince and Monsieur Love.

498
00:38:20,864 --> 00:38:21,864
I will hide me.

499
00:38:34,744 --> 00:38:37,744
See you where Benedick hath hid himself ?

500
00:38:37,947 --> 00:38:39,347
Very well, my lord.

501
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,155
Come, Balthasar,
we will hear that song again.

502
00:38:54,097 --> 00:38:57,097
Hmm, now divine air !

503
00:38:57,934 --> 00:39:00,164
Now is his soul ravished !

504
00:39:01,237 --> 00:39:03,587
Is it not strange
that sheep's guts. . .

505
00:39:03,873 --> 00:39:06,873
should hail souls out of men's bodies ?

506
00:39:09,813 --> 00:39:12,313
Sigh no more, ladies,

507
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,750
Sigh no more

508
00:39:15,885 --> 00:39:20,186
Men were deceivers ever,

509
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:23,657
One foot in sea,

510
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,820
And one on shore,

511
00:39:25,929 --> 00:39:28,556
To one thing,

512
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:31,157
Constant never.

513
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:33,268
Then sigh not so,

514
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:36,931
But let them go,

515
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:39,804
And be you blithe

516
00:39:39,876 --> 00:39:42,436
And bonny,

517
00:39:42,512 --> 00:39:45,208
Converting all

518
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:49,239
Your sounds of woe

519
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:53,179
Into Hey

520
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:57,717
Nonny, nonny.

521
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:02,795
Sing no more ditties,
Sing no more,

522
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:07,567
Of dumps so dull and heavy;

523
00:40:08,438 --> 00:40:11,438
The fraud of men

524
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,005
Was ever so,

525
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:16,077
Since summer

526
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,610
First was leafy,

527
00:40:19,681 --> 00:40:22,617
Then sigh not so,

528
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:25,280
But let them go,

529
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:28,188
And be you blithe

530
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,818
And bonny,

531
00:40:30,927 --> 00:40:33,862
Converting all

532
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:38,367
Your sounds of woe

533
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:41,697
Into Hey

534
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:47,141
Nonny, nonny.

535
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,880
By my troth, a good song.

536
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:53,539
And an ill singer, my lord.

537
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,585
No, no, faith; thou singest well enough.

538
00:40:56,652 --> 00:41:00,152
And he had been a dog that should have
howled thus, they would have hanged him !

539
00:41:05,161 --> 00:41:06,461
Come hither, Leonato.

540
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:09,097
What was it you told me of today,

541
00:41:09,364 --> 00:41:12,964
that your niece Beatrice
was in love with Signior Benedick ?

542
00:41:14,304 --> 00:41:16,904
I did never think that lady
would have loved any man.

543
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,809
No, nor l neither.

544
00:41:19,876 --> 00:41:23,226
But most wonderful that she
should so dote on Signior Benedick,

545
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:27,514
whom she hath in all outward
behaviors seemed ever to abhor.

546
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:29,876
Is it possible ?

547
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:32,820
Maybe she doth but counterfeit ?

548
00:41:32,889 --> 00:41:34,949
Faith, like enough.

549
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:39,358
O God ! Counterfeit ?

550
00:41:39,429 --> 00:41:41,429
There was never
counterfeit of passion. . .

551
00:41:41,797 --> 00:41:43,797
came so near the life of passion. . .

552
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,728
as she discovers it.

553
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,362
Why,

554
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:52,874
what effects of passion shows she ?

555
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,477
Bait the hook well.
This fish will bite.

556
00:41:56,012 --> 00:41:57,445
What effects, my lord ? 

557
00:42:05,021 --> 00:42:07,021
- You heard my daughter tell you how.
- She did, indeed.

558
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,652
How, l pray you ?

559
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:17,633
You amaze me.

560
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,670
I should think this a trick,

561
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,040
but that the gray-bearded fellow
speaks it.

562
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:26,992
Hath she made her
affection known to Benedick ?

563
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:29,394
No, and swears she never will.

564
00:42:29,646 --> 00:42:31,246
That's her torment.

565
00:42:31,648 --> 00:42:33,648
She'll be up twenty times a night,

566
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:37,318
and there will she sit in her smock
till she have writ a sheet of paper.

567
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:40,021
Then down upon her knees she falls,

568
00:42:40,523 --> 00:42:43,523
weeps, sobs, beats her heart,

569
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,461
tears her hair, curses,

570
00:42:45,728 --> 00:42:48,128
''Oh, sweet Benedick,

571
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:51,231
God give me patience.''

572
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,902
She doth indeed,
my daughter says so.

573
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:56,338
My daughter is sometime afeared . . .

574
00:42:56,806 --> 00:42:59,806
she will do
a desperate outrage to herself.

575
00:43:01,844 --> 00:43:03,436
It is very true.

576
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:05,514
It were good that Benedick knew of it.

577
00:43:05,815 --> 00:43:08,815
To what end ? He would make but a sport of it
and torment the poor lady worse.

578
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:11,119
I am sorry for her.

579
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:14,638
I pray you tell Benedick of it,
and hear what he will say.

580
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,925
- Were it good, think you ?
- Hero thinks surely she will die,

581
00:43:18,393 --> 00:43:20,943
for she says she will die
if he love her not,

582
00:43:21,264 --> 00:43:23,264
and she will die
ere she make her love known,

583
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,601
and she will die if he woo her.

584
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,621
If she should
make tender of her love,

585
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:31,931
'tis very possible he'll scorn it,

586
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:35,309
for the man, as you know all,
hath a contemptible spirit.

587
00:43:51,628 --> 00:43:55,628
I love Benedick well,
and l could wish he would . . .

588
00:43:55,797 --> 00:43:59,797
modestly examine himself, to see
how much he is unworthy. . . 

589
00:43:59,902 --> 00:44:02,166
so good a lady.

590
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:05,273
My lord, will you walk ?
Dinner is ready.

591
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,980
If he do not dote on her upon this,
l will never trust my expectation.

592
00:44:14,217 --> 00:44:18,217
Let there be the same net spread for her, and that
must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry.

593
00:44:18,621 --> 00:44:21,621
Let us send Beatrice
to call him in to dinner.

594
00:44:31,367 --> 00:44:34,201
This can be no trick.

595
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:36,271
The conference was sadly borne.

596
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:39,974
They have the truth
of this from Hero.

597
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:47,380
Love me ?

598
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:51,751
Why ? It must be requited.

599
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,987
I hear how l am censured.

600
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:58,759
They say l will bear myself proudly
if l perceive the love come from her.

601
00:44:59,027 --> 00:45:01,527
They say too
that she will rather die. . .

602
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:05,226
than give any sign of affection.

603
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:07,826
I did never think. . .

604
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:09,905
to marry.

605
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:11,607
I must not seem proud.

606
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:15,309
Happy are they that hear their
detractions and can put them to mending.

607
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:17,779
They say the lady is fair.
'Tis a truth, I can bear them witness.

608
00:45:18,047 --> 00:45:20,397
And virtuous, 'tis so,
I cannot reprove it.

609
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,150
And wise,
but for loving me.

610
00:45:23,686 --> 00:45:26,086
By my troth, it is
no addition to her wit,

611
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:29,723
nor no great argument
of her folly,

612
00:45:29,992 --> 00:45:32,791
for l will be. . .

613
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:36,023
horribly in love with her.

614
00:45:38,034 --> 00:45:41,384
I may chance have some odd quirks. . .

615
00:45:41,704 --> 00:45:43,704
and remnants of wit broken on me. . .

616
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:48,974
because l have railed so long
against marriage;

617
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:52,405
but doth not the appetite alter ?

618
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:56,083
A man loves the meat in his youth
that he cannot endure in his age.

619
00:45:56,518 --> 00:46:01,018
Shall these quips and sentences
and paper bullets of the brain. . .

620
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:04,458
awe a man from the career
of his humor ?

621
00:46:06,027 --> 00:46:06,688
No.

622
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,097
The world must be peopled.

623
00:46:14,737 --> 00:46:17,237
When l said l would die a bachelor,

624
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:19,708
I did not think l should live. . .

625
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:21,744
till l were married.

626
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:24,947
Here comes Beatrice !

627
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:30,579
By this day, she's a fair lady !

628
00:46:32,588 --> 00:46:34,588
I do spy some. . .

629
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:38,192
marks of love in her.

630
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,639
Against my will l am sent
to bid you come in to dinner.

631
00:46:53,342 --> 00:46:54,775
Fair Beatrice,

632
00:46:54,844 --> 00:46:57,972
I thank you for your pains.

633
00:47:03,518 --> 00:47:07,668
I took no more pains for those thanks
than you take pains to thank me.

634
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:10,158
If it had been painful
l would not have come.

635
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:13,427
You take pleasure, then,
in the message ?

636
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:18,831
Yea, just so much as you may take
upon a knife's point.

637
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:25,306
You have no stomach, signior ?
Fare you well.

638
00:47:40,389 --> 00:47:43,589
''Against my will l am sent. . .

639
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:46,494
to bid you come in to dinner.''

640
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:51,666
There's a double meaning in that.

641
00:47:54,804 --> 00:47:59,304
But are you sure that Benedick
loves Beatrice so entirely ?

642
00:48:03,646 --> 00:48:07,646
So says the prince
and my new trothed lord.

643
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:10,135
And did they bid you
tell her of it, madam ?

644
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,670
They did entreat me
to acquaint her of it,

645
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,290
but l persuaded them,
if they loved Benedick,

646
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:18,512
to wish him wrestle with affection
and never to let Beatrice know of it.

647
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:20,612
Why did you so ?
Doth not the gentleman. . .

648
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:23,464
deserve as full as fortunate a bed
as ever Beatrice shall couch upon ?

649
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,900
O God of love !
I know he doth deserve. . .

650
00:48:27,036 --> 00:48:29,036
as much as may be yielded to a man.

651
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:33,373
But Nature never framed a woman's heart
of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice.

652
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:38,577
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
misprising what they look on,

653
00:48:38,748 --> 00:48:41,248
and her wit values itself so highly. . .

654
00:48:41,617 --> 00:48:43,617
that to her all matter else
seems weak.

655
00:48:44,253 --> 00:48:47,253
- She cannot love.
- Sure, l think so.

656
00:48:47,623 --> 00:48:49,373
Yet tell her of it, hear what she will say.

657
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:50,026
No.

658
00:48:50,793 --> 00:48:54,748
Rather l will go to Benedick and counsel
him to fight against his passion.

659
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,998
Do not do your cousin such a wrong.

660
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,967
She cannot be so much
without true judgement,

661
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:03,237
having so swift and excellent a wit
as she is prized to have,

662
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:05,939
as to refuse so rare a gentleman
as Signior Benedick.

663
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:10,208
He is the only man of ltaly,
always excepted my dear Claudio.

664
00:49:10,313 --> 00:49:11,563
When are you married, madam ?

665
00:49:11,847 --> 00:49:13,782
Why, every day. . .

666
00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:14,849
tomorrow !

667
00:49:22,858 --> 00:49:24,858
She's limed, l warrant you.

668
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:27,362
We have caught her, madam.

669
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:30,364
If it prove so,
then loving goes by haps.

670
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:32,666
Some Cupid kills with arrows,
some with traps.

671
00:49:37,606 --> 00:49:41,606
What fire is in mine ears ?

672
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:43,672
Can this be true ?

673
00:49:43,746 --> 00:49:47,746
Stand l condemned
for pride and scorn so much ?

674
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:50,452
Contempt, farewell;

675
00:49:50,619 --> 00:49:52,619
and maiden pride, adieu.

676
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:56,090
No glory lives
behind the back of such.

677
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,396
And, Benedick,

678
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,465
Iove on.

679
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:06,195
I will requite thee,

680
00:50:06,302 --> 00:50:09,302
taming my wild heart
to thy loving hand.

681
00:50:09,739 --> 00:50:13,439
If thou dost love,
my kindness shall incite thee. . .

682
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:16,710
to bind our loves up
in a holy band.

683
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:20,114
For others say thou dost deserve,

684
00:50:20,416 --> 00:50:23,416
and l believe it. . .

685
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:25,954
better than reportingly.

686
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,280
Are you good men and true ?

687
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:02,617
Fight, fight, yea !

688
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:06,387
Being chosen for the prince's Watch.

689
00:52:07,422 --> 00:52:09,358
This is your charge:

690
00:52:11,193 --> 00:52:14,243
You are to bid any man stand,
in the prince's name.

691
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:16,193
How if he will not stand ?

692
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:20,952
Then, take no note of him
but let him go.

693
00:52:21,237 --> 00:52:25,237
If he will not stand when he is bidden,
he is none of the prince's subjects.

694
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:30,809
True ! And they are to meddle
with none but the prince's subjects.

695
00:52:41,056 --> 00:52:43,056
You shall also make no noise
in the streets.

696
00:52:44,827 --> 00:52:46,827
We will rather sleep than talk.

697
00:52:47,329 --> 00:52:51,329
You speak like an ancient. . .

698
00:52:51,467 --> 00:52:53,467
and a most quiet watchman,

699
00:52:53,702 --> 00:52:55,702
for l cannot see
how sleeping should offend.

700
00:53:00,309 --> 00:53:02,309
If you meet a thief. . .

701
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:05,612
you may suspect him,
by virtue of your office,

702
00:53:06,715 --> 00:53:07,715
to be no true man;

703
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:14,188
and for such kind of men,

704
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:17,224
the less you meddle or make with them, why the more is. . .

705
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:21,494
for your honesty.

706
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:25,132
You have been always called
a merciful man, partner.

707
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:30,333
Truly, l would not
hang a dog by my will,

708
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:33,467
much more a man
who hath any honesty in him.

709
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,476
'Tis very true.

710
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:47,456
Well, masters,

711
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:50,722
good night.

712
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:54,126
And if there be any matter
of weight chances,

713
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:56,164
call up me.

714
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:01,436
Come, neighbour.

715
00:54:03,505 --> 00:54:06,905
We hear our charge. Let us go sit here
upon the bench till two,

716
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:09,210
and then all to bed.

717
00:54:11,981 --> 00:54:13,681
One word more, honest neighbours.

718
00:54:13,983 --> 00:54:16,983
I pray you, watch about
Signior Leonato's door,

719
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,320
for the wedding being there tomorrow,
there is a great coil tonight.

720
00:54:23,492 --> 00:54:25,483
Adieu.

721
00:54:25,594 --> 00:54:28,791
Be vigitant, l beseech you.

722
00:55:04,867 --> 00:55:06,927
It is so:

723
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:09,703
the Count Claudio shall marry
the daughter of Leonato.

724
00:55:09,972 --> 00:55:11,972
Yea, my lord,
but l can cross it.

725
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:14,742
Any bar, any cross,
any impediment. . .

726
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:16,510
will be medicinable to me.

727
00:55:17,012 --> 00:55:18,712
I am sick in displeasure to him,

728
00:55:19,014 --> 00:55:22,364
and whatsoever comes athwart
his affection ranges evenly with mine.

729
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,152
How canst thou cross this marriage ?

730
00:55:24,652 --> 00:55:26,152
Not honestly, my lord,

731
00:55:26,655 --> 00:55:29,655
but so covertly that no dishonesty
shall appear in me.

732
00:55:29,925 --> 00:55:32,445
- Show me briefly how !
- I think l told your lordship a year since. . .

733
00:55:32,695 --> 00:55:37,045
how much l am in the favour of Margaret,
the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.

734
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,950
- I remember.
- I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night. . .

735
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:43,754
appoint her to look out
at her lady's chamber window.

736
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:46,224
What life is in that
to be the death of this marriage ?

737
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:49,076
The poison of that
lies in you to temper.

738
00:56:20,175 --> 00:56:21,175
Gallants. . .

739
00:56:21,844 --> 00:56:24,844
I am not as l have been.
