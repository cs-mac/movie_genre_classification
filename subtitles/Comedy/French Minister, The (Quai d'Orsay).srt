<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Ministry Team @ Viki</i>

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,000
Aw! My head.

4
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,010
Can't we get married for real?

5
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,610
Marry for real

6
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,940
Minister, marry me for real please?

7
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,760
What a weird dream. Pssh.

8
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,350
What kind of dream was that?

9
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,900
Pssh.

10
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,000
Where am I?

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,670
Jang-Soo method #12. Ha!

12
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,210
One. Ha!

13
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,750
Two. Ha!

14
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,990
One. Ha!

15
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,690
Two. Ha!

16
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,250
One. Ha!

17
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,640
Two. Ha!

18
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,950
One. Ha!

19
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,910
Two. Ha!

20
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,590
Look at your stance!

21
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,490
Stand like a mountain and move like the wind. Forgot it already?

22
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,320
No, we didn't!

23
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,740
Since I became the Prime Minister,

24
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,080
you have to be models to other childrens in Korea.

25
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,400
You children are

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,770
your dad's

27
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,410
face.

28
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,980
In that regards,

29
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,240
smartphone?

30
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,320
No way!

31
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,220
Studying English?

32
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,590
Don't even dream of it.

33
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,210
You want to stop kindergarten?

34
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,400
It's a stupid childish thing to say!

35
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,700
Kwon ManSae. Stop crying.

36
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,660
Wei-Soo method. Sang-Soo method. Shim-Sang method.

37
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,920
Practice it 10 times before you come back in.

38
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,490
That's all.

39
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,980
Chief Kang was going to be here. What brings you here?

40
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,610
It's your first day. Of course I should be here.

41
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,950
You'll have to wait a bit.

42
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,280
I have to get rid of some trash.

43
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,720
Trash?

44
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,940
Whoa!

45
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:53,150
The smell is not going away.

46
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:00,580
Whoa. How did I get here?

47
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,710
Aww. I can't remember a thing!

48
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,620
Now, I have just got to get out of here in a hurry.

49
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,660
Are you sober now?

50
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,860
Why am I here?

51
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,290
About yesterday. You don't remember?

52
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,460
Nothing at all?

53
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,980
You begged

54
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:54,070
me to marry you but don't remember that either?

55
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,000
Wasn't that in a dream?

56
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,730
Giving me the duck feet? (means pretending not to know)

57
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,680
Even if I did that, how can you bring me here?

58
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,620
I can't believe this.

59
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,540
You really don't remember?

60
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:14,530
"When we are together alone"

61
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,400
<i>Us two...</i>

62
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,970
Get a hold of yourself, Nam Da Jeong. <br>We're almost there.

63
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,450
Here. This is your house, right?

64
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,670
No, it isn't.

65
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,900
I've moved!

66
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,600
Really! This woman

67
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,750
If you moved, you should have told me.

68
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,770
So, where did you move to?

69
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,440
House? My house?

70
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,060
The house I lived with Dad?

71
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,150
Hey. Nam Da Jeong.

72
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,020
Minister. Please marry me. Please?

73
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,760
Please! Minister. Please.

74
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,770
Get her on your back.

75
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,720
Uhh. Should I?

76
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,480
Get her on your back!

77
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,670
Me. Uh. I can't because I got the bag.

78
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,060
How can I? It's your girlfriend.

79
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,460
It's my woman so I'll allow it.

80
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,840
Hurry and put her on your back!

81
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,910
Go to the Government office immediately.

82
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,630
At the police station

83
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:31,880
I bailed you out. On top of that you caused a ruckus like that and you ask

84
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,120
why did I bring you here?

85
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,500
You think I brought you here because I wanted to?

86
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,330
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:46,290
Ah really! I don't normally drink that much...

88
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,210
Exactly,

89
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,870
what is the reason in drinking like that?

90
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,130
More importantly,

91
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:57,630
why did you ask me to marry you?

92
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,150
<i>It's brain cancer.</i>

93
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,850
<i>Walking you into your wedding hall, <br>holding your hand, is my wish.</i>

94
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,770
<i>At the most, 6 months.</i>

95
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,110
I'm sorry, Prime Minister.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,290
I must have spilled my wanting to get married after I got drunk.

97
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,250
Please just forget it, as if it never happened. <br> Then...

98
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,540
Where are you going?

99
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,920
Nam Da Jeong slept here last night?

100
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,120
I think she was worried that the Minister wouldn't marry her so she had a few drinks.

101
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,620
She threw up and hung on him asking him to marry her.

102
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,130
It was chaos.

103
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:43,500
That woman asked to be married? She asked it of the Prime Minister?

104
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,040
What do I do about that woman?

105
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,450
Finally, is it really a first day starting as Prime Minister's staff?

106
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:05,370
Anyway, I wonder how reporter Nam Da Jeong is doing.

107
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,970
Cheif Kang, let me say something.

108
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,450
Nam Da Jeong isn't the woman you think she is.

109
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,880
Ahh! That's a real bad habit-not thanking people.

110
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,200
Look here.

111
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,380
I know you don't like her but you should be thanking her.

112
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:29,750
Also, no matter what anyone says, <br>I believe Nam Da Jeong to be a good person.

113
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,070
Let's go.

114
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:41,680
<i>I told ajumma everything, leave after the children leave.</i>

115
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,690
How long do I have to stay here?

116
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,440
Man Se!

117
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,970
<i>Man Se! Man Se!</i>

118
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,040
Aigoo! This rascal, skipping Kindergarten.

119
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,670
If the Prime Minister finds out, <br>there'll be big trouble! Man Se!

120
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:17,950
Man Se?! Man Se!

121
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:21,550
Hey, kid. You have to go to kindergarten! You can't miss school.

122
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,220
The car's already left.

123
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,740
But, what are you doing here?

124
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,980
Cleaning.

125
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,190
Cleaning?

126
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,160
Anyway, I have to go. Have fun.

127
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,030
Fine, go.

128
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,120
I'm fine, even if I'm alone and bored.

129
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,770
I always was.

130
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:51,160
So just go. You can go.

131
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,220
Man Se...

132
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,100
I guess I spilled my wanting to get married soon after I got drunk.

133
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,430
Did she really wanted to get married?

134
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,130
Today, as a man of your stature, you'll be facing a tough situations

135
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,910
So, Prime Minister must be ready.

136
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,000
What do you mean?

137
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,960
In other words, your training will begin.

138
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:29,750
With endless official greetings to wear you out.

139
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,780
Endless appearances and meetings.

140
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,680
You have to meet him. Please hurry.

141
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,550
This way. Let's go.

142
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,830
Prime Minister!

143
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,180
With their flattery and compliments, trying to get thier way.

144
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,670
You really are great.

145
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,430
Your popularity has reached the sky!

146
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:07,410
You are considered the best Prime Minister ever!

147
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,470
Stay as Prime Minister forever!

148
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,800
I thought the position was going to be some great thing.

149
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,400
Chief, Kang. I think you underestimated me.

150
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,600
Sorry?

151
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,100
Stop talking nonsense and get out of the car.

152
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,850
We have an urgent meeting scheduled with the Department managers regarding operations.

153
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,400
Cancel that.

154
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,160
What?

155
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,030
We'll start with the Office's budget.

156
00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:00,220
Please prepare a report of this years' expense and planned expense.

157
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,150
The Office's operating is a must. And a report of each departments' itemized expense and their budget.

158
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,840
Please make sure you miss nothing.

159
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,250
If 10 cents is missing or misallocated, then the managing person

160
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:18,560
may receive probation, suspension or dismissal.

161
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,030
You understand, right?

162
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:25,020
Then, see you at the meeting.

163
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,300
But, this seems to be the Prime Minister's room. <br>Can you do this here?

164
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,400
This is the safest place.

165
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:47,770
Because my dad is the King of Prick, if we came in without permission, we're dead.

166
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:52,300
He is rather prickly.

167
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,500
Tada!

168
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:00,230
You know the method, right? <br>Now you have a go.

169
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:34,400
It is triangular underwear.

170
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,700
I think I can start to understand his taste.

171
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:51,600
<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Ministry Team @Viki</i>

172
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,220
What's wrong?

173
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,410
Huh?

174
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,740
It's nothing.

175
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,960
Wow, you folded it well!

176
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,340
Ahjumma, do you know how to fold a turtle?

177
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,330
A turtle?

178
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,120
A turtle... of course I can!

179
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,200
I'll show you.

180
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,980
Man Se, why are you sucking your thumb?

181
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,590
Because I'm hungry.

182
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,290
You didn't eat breakfast earlier?

183
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,510
I did. Twice.

184
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,800
But you're still hungry?

185
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,250
I'm so hungry, I could die.

186
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,740
Ajumma, do you have any bread?

187
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,380
Bread?

188
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,870
Man Se,

189
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,200
you're not really hungry.

190
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,300
I'm not lying. I'm really hungry.

191
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,470
I'm hungry!

192
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,660
Come here.

193
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,700
Quickly!

194
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,750
Man Se,

195
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,450
you're bored and hungry, right?

196
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,020
I was like that too, when I was young.

197
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:12,470
But whenever that happened,<br> my dad hugged me,

198
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,220
and I completely forgot I was hungry.

199
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,860
How is it? You're not hungry, right?

200
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,200
No, I'm still hungry.

201
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,090
That can't be.

202
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,490
That can't be!

203
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,420
Man Se,

204
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,530
so you were here?

205
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,940
You still haven't left?

206
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,100
I'm going now.

207
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,900
Man Se, I'm going. Take care.

208
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,680
What about the turtle?

209
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,860
Man Se!

210
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,180
Where are you going?

211
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,700
Aigoo! Aigoo!

212
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:04,700
Looks like a sly fox. That's why the Minister fell for her.

213
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,900
ManSe, did that person.. Okay. Okay.

214
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:14,910
Ohh. You're a good kid, ManSe. Okay. Okay.

215
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,390
Wait!

216
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,680
I came to change the light bulb, but I'm finished now.

217
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,400
She met Man Se?

218
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,270
Kwon Man Se,

219
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,600
don't mess around with my phone.

220
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,290
The rest of the kids?

221
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,780
Woo Ri and Na Ra went to school so I didn't see them.

222
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,700
I don't know what she did to him but MansSe got fooled by her.

223
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:28,600
She was folding origami with him in your bedroom.

224
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,600
Wait, she went into my bedroom?

225
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,300
Yes.

226
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,020
This woman, really!

227
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:39,360
Dad, don't be surprised and listen.

228
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,950
I'm actually...

229
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,490
not dating the Prime Minister.

230
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:49,500
This isn't right.

231
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,300
I'm going crazy. What do I say to Dad?

232
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:07,000
<i>Tomorrow, come to my house.<br> If you don't, you're dead.</i>

233
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,300
Why is he calling me?

234
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,180
Why the heck?

235
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:16,510
Nam Da Jeong, you dared to enter my bedroom?

236
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,500
And your nerve extends to climbing onto my bed?

237
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,580
What on earth do you want?

238
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:31,400
With this kind of stunt, you intend to wear me down to marry you?

239
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,180
No, Prime Minister! <br>I really have no desire to marry you!

240
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,670
-That was just drunken nonsense-<br>-Forget it!

241
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:43,130
There's only one way to make a shameless<br> woman come to her senses.

242
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,500
--Arrest her!<br>--Yes!

243
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,850
Prime Minister! I was wrong!

244
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,100
I was wrong, forgive me! Prime Minister!

245
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,800
Prime Minister!

246
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,200
Forgive me!

247
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:08,400
No. If he was going to arrest me, he would have just called the police.

248
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,460
Why on earth is he calling me?

249
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,380
Who called you?

250
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,720
You sent me a text.

251
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,870
When did I?

252
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,530
Psshh

253
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,100
Look.

254
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,300
Here.

255
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,070
You sent it.

256
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,600
<i>Come to my house tomorrow.<br> If you don't, you're dead.</i>

257
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,700
Are you for real? Who is this?

258
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,130
It's your number! Look!

259
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,500
No...

260
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,300
<i>Come to my house tomorrow.<br> If you don't, you're dead.</i>

261
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,730
How did this happen?

262
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,160
Kwon Man Se?

263
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,100
Man Se this rascal.

264
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,910
Why hasn't ahjumma come?

265
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,000
Did she not see my text?

266
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,190
Man Se!

267
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,870
Aigoo. What are you doing here?

268
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,380
The Prime Minister is in an uproar.

269
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,520
Did you make trouble?

270
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,190
Let's go.

271
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:18,330
Wait, I'll just go in for a little bit! Just one hour!

272
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,340
No, my Noona is in there!

273
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,720
Ah! Ah...

274
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,120
Editor-in-Chief, they say we can't go in without an invitation. What do we do?

275
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,250
Ah, should I contact Da Jeong?

276
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,110
If she had any intention to take us, she wouldn't have left alone in the first place.

277
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:35,320
Ah! Reporter Nam, that awful girl.

278
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,510
She doesn't have the spirit of mutual dependence!

279
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:41,200
Ah, seriously. Here are the dung flies again.

280
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,760
Hey, Scandal News.

281
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,960
If it's possible, let's not see each other in places like this.

282
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,570
You third-rate, low-quality, paparazzi specializing media.

283
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:55,650
What would you have to cover at the Prime Minister's place?

284
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,300
Ah, you're working hard.

285
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,720
I'm from Korea's main newspaper, Goryeo Ilbo. Byun Woo Chul.

286
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,950
Today is a private banquet.<br>-Huh?

287
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,370
I said, media coverage is forbidden.

288
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,030
Ah...

289
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,960
Aigoo!

290
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,680
Whether it's Goryeo Ilbo or Guryeo (stinky) Ilbo...

291
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,020
Stinky dung-smelling newspapers are sure different!

292
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,320
Ah, you're right. Why would dung flies show up?

293
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,240
They show up because they smell stinky poop.

294
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,040
Gosh.

295
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,570
What you said was right.

296
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,900
They say it was Man Se who sent it.

297
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,730
Really?

298
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,990
Well, you don't have to be sorry. I can just leave.

299
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,950
In any case, you don't have any business with me. Right?

300
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,770
There, there is a Prime Minister's inauguration banquet.

301
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,970
Yes, before people see me,

302
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,480
I will hurry and disappear. Then.

303
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,440
Aigoo.

304
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,460
I didn't know you were here.

305
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,880
We were going to change your light bulb. Should we come back later?

306
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,970
Oh? Really.

307
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,960
You guys replaced it yesterday, but it went out again.

308
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,090
What do you mean we replaced it?

309
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:10,810
The electrician was on vacation yesterday.

310
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,550
Right?

311
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,810
Yes.

312
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,860
No...

313
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,680
<i>I came to change the light bulb. It's done now.</i>

314
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,910
Yesterday, I definitely saw a man leaving after changing the bulb.

315
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,050
I saw it.

316
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:30,150
<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Ministry Team @ Viki</i>

317
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,010
Son.

318
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:41,160
You must be hungry. Go eat something.

319
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:48,050
So do you think Prime Minister Kwon invited that woman?

320
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,950
I'm talking about his girlfriend.

321
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,300
Is Kwon Yul someone to do that?

322
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,560
Chief Seo, it's been a while.

323
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,370
Thank you for attending. Then.

324
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,330
That Chief Seo. She must have spent a lot of money at the dermatologist.

325
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:22,820
Indeed. Considering her age,

326
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,730
that kind of skin isn't natural.

327
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,830
Please stop saying such shallow things.

328
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,210
I'm afraid someone will hear it.

329
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,070
Madame Na!

330
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:33,770
Madame Na!

331
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,460
You came?

332
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,590
Oh, you look so lovely today.

333
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,190
How can you be so beautiful?

334
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,670
I searched around your official residence,

335
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,100
but I didn't find any bugging devices or cameras.

336
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,990
Nothing's missing, too.

337
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,000
Ok, I got it.

338
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,450
I'm sorry, Nam Da Jeong...

339
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,310
But today, you'll have to help me one more time.

340
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,470
The only outsiders who entered the residence yesterday

341
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:02,200
were the employees from the catering company who came to prepare for the banquet.

342
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,430
Since he failed yesterday,

343
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,010
he might try again today.

344
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,170
I need you to attend the banquet

345
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:11,520
and confirm who the spy is.

346
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,110
Yes.

347
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,050
But...well, I'm fine with it...

348
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,880
Will it be all right with this outfit?

349
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,330
I contacted Chief Seo, so do something about it.

350
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,500
And do something about your hair.

351
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,820
Like this?

352
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,240
No...like this.

353
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,780
Like this? This?

354
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,580
No...I mean, tuck it behind your ear like this.

355
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,540
Ah! I'll do this! This!

356
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,050
Come here!

357
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,370
How?

358
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,680
Towards the back.

359
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,850
Ah, towards the back.

360
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:53,750
So it looks natural.

361
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,080
Ah...towards the back like this, this. Ok, AHHH!

362
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,560
AH! It hurts! Prime Minister!

363
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,170
Ah, what do I do?

364
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,850
Stay still. Wait, what's with this?

365
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,570
Ah, Prime Minister! It hurts!

366
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,220
I said move your hand.

367
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,050
Stay still! Stay still!

368
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,000
Prime Minister!

369
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,100
<i>It's alright, it's alright.</i>

370
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,440
<i>Ah, it hurts, Prime Minister!</i>

371
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,810
<i>Just stay still!</i>

372
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:26,200
Y-You can't go in now.

373
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,160
It's...hot right now.

374
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,070
What are you talking about?<i><br>-Ahhh!</i>

375
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,640
<i>Prime Minister!<br></i>-No, you can't.

376
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,470
Chief...

377
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,530
Seo...

378
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,020
It hurts! Ahh!

379
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,250
What do I do? Ahhh!

380
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,100
You're here?

381
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,930
Chief Seo.

382
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:51,400
Try to do something about her.

383
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,480
Chief S...

384
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,660
I'm sorry.

385
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,020
You're truly doing all kinds of things.

386
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,660
I heard you came to the residence yesterday, too. And you came again today.

387
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:17,450
If you keep this up, when will we announce the break-up?

388
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:21,120
I didn't come here because I wanted to.

389
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,600
There's really no answer to this.

390
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,000
We can't let you show up looking like this.

391
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,100
But we can't go buy clothes now.

392
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,970
You really became the Prime Minister.

393
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,920
You became a Prime Minister, overcoming that enormous scandal. It's amazing.

394
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,920
Let's just say I was lucky.

395
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,050
I thought you wouldn't come. Thanks for coming.

396
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,210
No need for thanks.

397
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,460
As an underlying, of course I should come greet you.

398
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,350
We'll see each other often at the government complex.

399
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,350
That's good.

400
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,690
As a matter of fact,

401
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:56,420
it seems like you've gained sudden interest in my personal affairs lately.

402
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,300
From now on, you're curious about something,

403
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,210
ask me directly.

404
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,240
Don't go through such trouble for nothing.

405
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:08,070
I don't know what you're talking about, but I'll keep that in mind.

406
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,820
Do you think it was really Minister Park?

407
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,750
I don't know.

408
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,380
Ms. Nam Da Jeong needs to find out.

409
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,610
But when did Reporter Nam see that man?

410
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:31,130
In any case, why isn't Ms. Nam Da Jeong showing up?

411
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,930
Are you celebrating by yourself?

412
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,170
You and Kwon Yul are really something.

413
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,880
You guys know how to make a ridiculous dating scandal.

414
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,800
But the main character wasn't passable.

415
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,500
If it was you, Seo Hye Ju, I would have believed about a half of it.

416
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,250
You must be quite distressed.

417
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,800
You tried so hard to knock down the Prime Minister.

418
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,210
But you failed.

419
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,140
By chance, just because he became Prime Minister,

420
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,700
you don't think he won, do you?

421
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,340
The real fight will start from now on.

422
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,030
Just stop already.

423
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,090
Aren't you tired of it?

424
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:00,720
That's what I want to ask you.

425
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,670
For 20 years, you're by Kwon Yul, only looking at him.

426
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,880
The 15-year-old juvenile delinquent who was

427
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,510
saved by a college oppa. Isn't this too much to be just a pure love towards him?

428
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:13,930
I don't want to hear any more. Excuse me.

429
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,700
Minister Park Joon Gi.

430
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,920
In college, your nickname was 'Kwon Yul's bodyguard', right?

431
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,210
When you were immature, being Kwon Yul's bodyguard was at least cute. Now it's a bit hideous.

432
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:27,200
It seems like you're clinging to him because you have nowhere else to go.

433
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,550
For 20 years, you haven't been able to confess to him properly. You just remained as a college hoobae,

434
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,730
as his aide, and as the Chief of his Secretary's Office.

435
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:37,920
I can't understand why you're living like this.

436
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,490
Don't try to understand.

437
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:42,580
I don't want to be understood by you.

438
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,610
And...as long as people like you are around the Prime Minister,

439
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:50,550
I think the Prime Minister will still need his bodyguard.

440
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,790
<i>45th Prime Minister Kwon Yul's Inauguration Banquet<br></i>What's with your clothes? There was nothing else?

441
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,670
Why? Is it weird?

442
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,950
Of course it's weird. What's with the dress? It's too short.

443
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,680
This is the most decent among Yu Ri

444
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,820
Yu Ri? What is that?

445
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,840
Yu Ri... there

446
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,050
She is the most popular idol these days.

447
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,560
I borrowed this outfit from her.

448
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,100
Wait a minute.

449
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,370
Na Ra said her favorite idol is Yu Ri

450
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,220
That's her?

451
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,290
Liking such loser?

452
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:33,180
Na Ra, I should ban her from watching TV.

453
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,460
Oh.. Prime minister.. you are so petty

454
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,870
You act that way with kids, they will outcast you.

455
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,650
Petty?

456
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,730
This is none of business.

457
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:45,180
You make sure you catch that guy.

458
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,990
Understand?

459
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:50,010
Sorry but let go of my arm.

460
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,940
Separate.

461
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,700
Man Se

462
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,650
So,

463
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:14,710
you called me out to make this?

464
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,920
Man Se

465
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,810
you can't use your dad's phone to call me, ok?

466
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,180
Alright.

467
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,680
Then, I can call you through home phone, right?

468
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:26,960
Ehhh...

469
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,950
If you fold loosely, it will not hold at battle

470
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,640
Chief Kang.

471
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,290
Shall I make it for you? I used to be a champion.

472
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,110
That's ok.

473
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:48,650
Reporter Nam, you look so different with that outfit.

474
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,590
Over exceeed Yu Ri!!

475
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,100
You flatter me.

476
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,490
I might mistake that for real.

477
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,770
It is real.

478
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:59,170
Pretty, really.

479
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,170
Didn't think we will meet again,

480
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,840
but seeing you now, I am glad.

481
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,170
Me too.

482
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,080
That's the guy.

483
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,710
That guy.

484
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,430
Height 185cm with slim built

485
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,650
disguised as a waiter.

486
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,590
One more thing, he has pierced left ear.

487
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:34,420
Please be discreet and find him at once.

488
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,840
Yes.

489
00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:00,740
This is chief of education's wife Lee Dal Jang

490
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,920
And this is Chief Administor's wife

491
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,970
Na Yoon Hee.

492
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:09,450
Ahhh. She is the youngest daughter of Myung Shim group?

493
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:12,490
Yes, you are right. That's her.

494
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,290
I'm not even a celebrity,

495
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,050
so how do you know me?

496
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:19,870
Why? Your famous!

497
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:23,470
When was it? Has it been 15 years?

498
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:27,960
You got your picture taken with KanHwaDong boogying and that was a big new then.

499
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,990
At that time, MyungShin Group was going to destroy the newspaper company but

500
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,620
That photographer was just fired and it was done.

501
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,790
That fired photographer is the <br>editor-in-chief of our Scandal News.

502
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,090
That's why I know you a little.

503
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,670
Hey, get out the way.

504
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,160
Its bad enough seeing you at school.

505
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,150
I'll overlook it today even if you don't call me Hyung.

506
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:00,220
Your stepmother is over there.

507
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,280
Unbelievable. That woman came here?

508
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,430
Shouldn't her son and daughter<br> go over there and help her?

509
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:12,930
Can't you tell the mood? It looks<br> like she's getting walked over by my mom.

510
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:15,170
If she step over her, I'll be thankful.

511
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,960
You mother talks sweet and gets them.

512
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,400
I wish she'd show her skill here.

513
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:27,820
She's a really strange woman.

514
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,750
What's the reason in bringing that up now?

515
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,490
Are you trying to humiliate our madame?

516
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,050
No, it's not that...

517
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:40,140
I'm sorry. I thoughtlessly...

518
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,480
Well, it doesn't matter.

519
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,940
It's all the past.

520
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,490
By the way, I thought our Prime Minister's

521
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:51,950
taste was refined and composed,

522
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,930
but it totally isn't.

523
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,320
Drops in class.

524
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,330
<i>Aren't all men like that?</i>

525
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:00,600
If the woman is you and pretty, they don't care about class.

526
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,550
Even so, that shouldn't be.

527
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,830
<i>Look at these women.</i>

528
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,060
You're probably curious as to <br>why the Prime Minister is dating me.

529
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,580
Yes. The Prime Minister is a man too.

530
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,180
So I guess you could say that my young and fresh charm

531
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,850
caused him to fall head over heels.

532
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:24,150
So you, with your young and fresh charm, overcame the Prime Minister?

533
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,010
That's what you're saying, right?

534
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,740
But then again,

535
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,420
The Prime Minister, too, must have been<br> so lonely for the last seven years,

536
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,930
It must have been hard for him.

537
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:39,030
It seems you don't like me.

538
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,840
Even so, don't talk of the Prime Minister like that.

539
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,910
You should've been an actress instead of a reporter.

540
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,540
You act like a real girlfriend.

541
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,370
The Prime Minister and I are really dating.

542
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,850
Is that so?

543
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,960
Then you'll get married too, huh?

544
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,740
Why can't you answer?

545
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,730
Seeing as she can't answer, they won't.

546
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,200
All that noise about him dating.

547
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:10,460
Isn't this like conning the people?

548
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,350
We will get married.

549
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,250
The Prime Minister and I will get married.

550
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,370
So put your worries aside.

551
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,730
Prime Minister...

552
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,410
Are you in your right mind?

553
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,610
How could you say that in front of those people?

554
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:52,500
With what thought did you spout such ridiculous nonsense?

555
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,350
That...

556
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:57,940
Those women were cursing you! I unknowingly...

557
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,840
Whether they curse me or not, <br>what has that got to do with you?

558
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,640
Have you become my real girlfriend?

559
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,450
I'm sorry.

560
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,380
Saying sorry is useless.<br>What are you going to do now?

561
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,510
Now a rumour of our marriage is a matter of time.

562
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:13,080
What are you going to do about it?

563
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,620
How are you going to fix it?

564
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,070
How did it go?

565
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,240
<i>We caught him.</i>

566
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,500
If there's no evidence, there's not much we can do.

567
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,310
Let him go.

568
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,620
Forget it. Go back.

569
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,120
How can I just go?

570
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,670
I caused trouble...

571
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,080
Then,

572
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,720
do you have a good solution?

573
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:02,480
Last time you saved me by saying we're dating.

574
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,360
What is it this time?

575
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,750
Ah, that's right.

576
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:14,700
This time, we can just announce our marriage.

577
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,500
I didn't even think of that.

578
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,880
What do you think?

579
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,940
Isn't it good?

580
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:29,400
Then can we really not do that?

581
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,280
What?

582
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,420
Announce our wedding.

583
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,820
Can't we really do that?

584
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,330
Nam Da Jeong,

585
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,760
are you being serious?

586
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,670
I asked you if you're serious.

587
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,900
Yes.

588
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,660
What?

589
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:59,330
So what I'm saying is, not to really marry,

590
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:03,120
but do a contract marriage.

591
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:09,100
Contract marriage?

592
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,770
Yes.

593
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,510
For six months only.<br> It doesn't need to be any longer.

594
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:18,310
Just six months is enough.

595
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:22,210
There's your perspective too, so

596
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,780
until you say otherwise.

597
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,400
What do you think, Prime Minister?

598
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,550
So,

599
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:36,970
are you saying that you really want to maary me?

600
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,870
Yes.

601
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:51,180
<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Ministry Team @ VIKI</i>

602
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,510
Fine. Let's get married.

603
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:13,130
Be that as it may, this incident's number 1 contributor<br>is also reporter Nam, isn't it?

604
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:17,840
If it weren't for reporter Nam, we could have moved <br>passed it without realizing anything was amiss.

605
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,150
Chief Kwan.

606
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:25,220
I wasn't going quite mention this, but have you any idea<br>how Nam Da Jeong that woman spotted the spy?

607
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:30,710
The day before yesterday, she slept in the official residence<br>drunk. That's how she came to spot him.

608
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,230
What did you say?

609
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:39,880
Do you think that's all? She even hung onto Prime<br>Minister begging him to marry her.

610
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,590
Do you still think Nam Da Jeong is a nice woman?

611
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:57,310
Mr. Prime Minister.

612
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:02,000
Rea-lly... Are you really going to marry me?

613
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,550
That's right. I will marry you.

614
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,670
Let's get married.

615
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:11,590
Thank you. Thank you, Prime Minister!

616
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,710
Except, I...

617
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,900
don't do things like contract marriage.

618
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,600
Wh-a-t?

619
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,720
What do you mean?

620
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,710
It's not like we're playing at child's game. A contract marriage?

621
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,980
Why would I do stuff like that?

622
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:38,030
If I do, it'll be a regular marriage. A <i>regular marriage</i>!

623
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:40,560
You do understand what that means, eh?

624
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,160
Using one bed,

625
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:55,370
and on top of that bed...

626
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:58,180
you know what comes after even without the explanation, don't you?

627
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,370
Mr. Prime Minister, why are you... acting like this suddenly?

628
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:07,270
What do you mean suddenly?

629
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:11,540
Why? Do you want to play coy by pretending you don't <br>understand what I mean?

630
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:15,430
We-ll, th-a-t's not what I mean. It's just that...

631
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:16,160
I just...

632
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,060
I wonder why you'd suddenly ask me to marry you.

633
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:24,880
You played a part of my girlfriend,

634
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,900
now have you come to desire the post of Prime Minister's wife?

635
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:34,580
Are you saying that as long as you can become the Prime Minister's wife, the fact that he has three children means naught?

636
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:41,000
Ms. Nam Do Jeong,

637
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:46,590
listen carefully to what I'm about to say carefully and correctly.

638
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,330
I won't ever do things like "marriage".

639
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:54,360
Even if I get crazed and get married,

640
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:59,360
it won't ever be to a person like you, Nam Da Jeong.

641
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,250
Got that?

642
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,420
Take your leave.

00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:53,340
You must be on your way out now?

646
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,650
Yes, I should go now.

647
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:58,390
Ah, I heard you caught the spy?

648
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:02,010
We caught him, thanks to you, reporter Nam.

649
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:04,390
Don't mention it.

650
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:11,720
By the way, why is your face seem so solemn?

651
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,400
Because I heard about even scarier womn

652
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,330
than a spy.

653
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:21,630
Approached [the PM] with premeditation using the excuse<br> of acting as his girlfriend,

654
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:25,050
then got drunk and begged him to get married,

That scary woman... Is that woman the very person<br> who is standing in front of me?

657
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,660
Chief Kang,

658
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,100
what really happened was that...

659
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:43,270
I don't think that was your fault, since the one that <br>encouraged you was me.

660
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:47,090
However, this is as far as it goes.

661
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:54,160
I had no idea that you were such an opportunist,<br>and thought you a nice, fun, and cute woman.

662
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:59,290
I don't ever want to see you put on an innocent face.

663
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,210
That's right. I am an opportunist.

664
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:06,890
Whether you call me an opportunist or a scary woman,

665
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:09,050
it doesn't matter to me.

666
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,440
As it is true that I did want to get married

667
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,320
to Prime Minister.

668
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,980
I am sorry.

669
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:25,020
All is well if I apologize like this, right?

670
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,690
That woman really bragged that she'd really

671
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:43,060
get married to the Prime Minister.

672
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:46,750
Minister, they're saying that the special delivery is not<br>transferring well.

673
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,990
I am sorry.

674
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,740
Idiots.

675
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,370
A special delivery? What special delivery?

676
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:56,330
Never mind about that. Go on.

677
00:45:56,330 --> 00:46:00,300
Honey. Do something.

678
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:04,140
I really can't attend to some chit like that as the Prime Minister's wife.

679
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,960
Don't go overboard.

680
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,450
They will declare separation soon enough.

681
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:14,890
She's quite the preposterous one. She dares to brag<br>about getting married?

682
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:23,380
<i>Are you saying that as long as you can become the Prime Minister's wife, the fact that his three children mean naught?</i>

683
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:29,730
<i>I had no idea that you were such an opportunist,<br>and thought you a nice, fun, and cute woman.</i>

684
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:34,040
I guess I deserved hearing that I'm an opportunist.

685
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,830
I have nothing to say in my defense even when I hear<br>that sort of reference.

686
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:48,600
So then what do I do about my dad?

687
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,750
<i>Would it be okay to announce the wedding</i>

688
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,780
<i>in reality?</i>

689
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,190
It didn't seem like she was just throwing it out there.

690
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,680
<i>Just for 6 months.</i>

691
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:13,880
<i>I don't need it for longer than that. All I need is for 6 months.</i>

692
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:24,220
It's not something I should concern myself over.<br>I should have them release a separation declaration.

693
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,430
Kwon Man Se!

694
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:41,590
- This guy is Nancho (a card game suit).<br><i> My real honey.</i>

695
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:53,150
My real honey? And who is this guy?

696
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:57,090
Hey, Da Jeong. What didn't you go back sooner?

697
00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:02,230
Oh, okay. I should get going. I'll go.

698
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:07,390
Meju... (a card suit).

699
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:11,420
This, this rascal right here is Gongsan (a card suit).

700
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:13,250
Dad.

701
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,350
I have something to tell you.

702
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,100
I feel really bad for you, but the Prime Minister and I...

703
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,230
I know. I know everything.

704
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:32,520
You want to say that if you get married,

705
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:36,020
you won't be able to come see me often.

706
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,540
Ah, Dad, that's not what I meant...

707
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:42,530
Ah, never mind.

708
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:47,330
Once I take you down the aisle,

709
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:50,370
I'd consider my duties completed.

710
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:54,310
I won't have anything to regret,

711
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:56,870
even if I die on the very same day.

712
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:09,170
Hey you're out of water. I'll fetch some, Dad.

713
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,660
Why do you keep calling this woman, huh?

714
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:38,320
I told you not to do it clearly, no?

715
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:42,200
Kwon Man Se, stop! Stop your crying!

716
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,170
From now on, don't ever do this again.

717
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:48,430
This is an order!

718
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:07,400
Nam Da Jung, that woman.

719
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:10,620
Just what did she do to a child?

720
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:18,700
<i>Scandal News Reporter Nam Da Jung <i></i></i>

721
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,940
Don't worry about it. Man Se called you.

722
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:31,330
Son-in-Law! Your my son-in-Law right?

723
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:35,260
I'm Da Jung's father.

728
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,990
Six months.

729
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,660
Why does it have to be six months?

730
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:18,260
Here's Da Jung's fathers report.

731
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:22,290
The Prime Minister asked for it right?

732
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:23,790
Why did you bring it?

733
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:26,920
Prime Minister. I just have one thing to say.

734
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,170
That woman asked you to marry her.

735
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,700
I know everything.

736
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:37,020
That woman, this was her intention from the beginning.

737
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:40,640
But why are you giving a woman like that attention?

738
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,210
Do you by chance have any intention to marry her?

739
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:46,310
That won't happen.

740
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:49,230
So, don't worry about it.

741
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:51,450
That's a relief.

742
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:55,970
Then, I'll be preparing statement supporting that.

Prime Minister. You have to go see Man Se.

750

<i>The Ahjumma is really good at folding frogs. <i></i></i>

775
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:26,500
What are you doing here?

776
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,350
Can't you see? I came here to make the kids kimchi.

777
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:32,370
From now, i'm going to change my image from a dating girl to an angel.

778
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,600
Pretty good concept, huh?

779
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,390
Here, your clothes. I wore them well.

780
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:40,350
You could have just kept them.

781
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,450
Ah. I threw away your clothes.

782
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:45,360
Why would you throw away others perfectly good clothes?

783
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,700
That's why I called you!

784
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:51,280
I waited for Scandal News and didn't call anyone else.

785
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,160
You have to take pretty pictures.

786
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,140
Oh. It's cold.

787
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,430
Why isn't there any reporters here?

788
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:11,980
They said that if we called Roo Re here, there would be reporters following everywhere.

789
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:16,150
There's no one here. <br>But if that woman really becomes the Prime Minister's wife,

790
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:20,000
will she represent us wives?

791
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,910
Say things that make sense.

792
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:26,550
According to my husband, the Prime Minister will never remarry.

793
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:31,730
I should have stepped on that bitch so she couldn't utter another word.

794
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:40,650
But why does she hate that woman so much?

795
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:42,710
Kang Ho Dong. Kang Ho Dong!

796
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:43,870
Kang Ho Dong?

797
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:46,020
The thing she hates the most is

798
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:49,320
when someone talks of her past. A bit too much though.

799
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,500
That's right.

800
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,100
What are you doing not coming?

801
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:55,200
Yes.

802
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:03,500
Why are those people here?

803
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:07,400
They came to make kimchi That Baek Ha or

804
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,500
a group of politicians wives.

805
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,470
I was invited here.

806
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:13,480
I don't think I can do this Roo Re.

807
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:16,580
I'll help you out some other time. Sorry.

808
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:19,950
Unni, where are you going? Unni!

809
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,970
Bulleye!

810
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:31,500
Wow. Who is this?

811
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:36,230
You said that you would be the Prime Ministers wife. So, did you come here to practice community service?

812
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:38,420
No, I came for an interview.

813
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:42,770
Oh, so the reporter that Roo Re called,

814
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:44,690
was you.

815
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:48,060
Anyways, I wanted to see you.

816
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,830
This is good.

817
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:52,250
Why?

818
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:55,950
You. Say it truthfully.

819
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:59,000
You aren't going to marry the Prime Minister.

820
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,900
I heard some things too so you should tell the truth.

821
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:10,950
You, your not going to marry. Right?

822
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:13,870
Why can't you say anthing?

823
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:18,950
That,s right. Back then, you responded very well.

824
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:22,750
Yes, that's right.

825
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:25,400
I'm not marrying the Prime Minister.

826
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,660
Back then, I was just in the moment.

827
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,310
I'm sorry.

828
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:34,080
Of course.

829
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,580
You, your a lot to handle even though your young.

830
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:41,000
Saying something about being young and fresh.

831
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,690
Do you want to go around like this throwing yourself around and fix yourself?

832
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:47,810
Madam. <br>Do your parents know that you go around like this?

833
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:51,000
Or, were they happy selling their daughter off?

834
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,750
Is it like that? <br>Your wording is harsh madam.

835
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:57,370
I don't mind being cursed at.

836
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:59,300
But, don't talk about my parents like that.

837
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:03,940
But, you don't like us cursing your parents.

838
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:06,270
Wow. You guys are too much.

839
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:09,790
On the outside, you guys seems so elegant and royally but how can you say things like that?

840
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:13,400
Are you not embarrassed as wives of politicians?

841
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,910
What? What are you saying?

842
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:17,940
A you as the wife of the Minister for Administration and Planning.

843
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:19,840
I will live my life.

844
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:24,730
Don't interfere into other's lives and only say good things thinking of the society.

845
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:27,550
Do you understand? <br>What in the what?

846
00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:28,830
You.

847
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:31,230
Stop it.

848
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:35,740
Prime Minister.

849
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,200
No matter how angry you are, this isn't right.

850
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:45,600
Embarrassing.

851
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,580
You have no shame in fighting.

852
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:52,000
Is this how a future Prime Minister's wife acts?

853
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,360
Yes?

854
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:59,670
I heard you came to make kimchi.

855
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:02,850
I can't do nothing for such a good act.

856
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:07,090
I will donate one thousand more cabbages.

857
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:09,960
Then, good luck.

858
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,010
One thousand?

859
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:22,490
Why are you here?

860
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:25,350
And, why are you saying things like that?

861
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:28,030
What things? <br> A Prime Minister's wife.

862
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:30,480
What kind of nonsense is that.

863
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,750
I know you did that to help me but there was no need to do that.

864
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:37,730
Why would I help you. I only said the truth.

865
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:40,120
What?

866
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,950
You still don't understand?

867
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,330
Wait.

868
01:00:48,330 --> 01:00:52,150
So, your saying that...

869
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:57,310
Yes. I am saying that I will marry you.

870
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:01,930
Nam Da Jung,

871
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:05,020
You will have to marry me.

872
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:23,500
<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Ministry Team @ Viki</i>

873
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:57,700
<i>We use one room, one bed. <i></i></i>

874
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:00,400
<i>Are you thinking farther than that? <i></i></i>

875
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,260
<i>I don't know if this marriage is right. <i></i></i>

876
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:04,060
<i>A contract?<i></i></i>

877
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:06,380
<i>Since this is a contract marriage, it definitely needs a contract. <i></i></i>

878
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:10,640
<i>I heard your marrying my dad. Just because of that do you think i'm going to call you mom. <i></i></i>

879
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,290
In other words, you better be ready.

885
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:25,070

886
