1
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:50,642
ah...

2
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:37,249
oh, no!
I don't believe it!

3
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:01,273
Oh, my God, Monica.

4
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:02,074
It's Frank Crawford.

5
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:05,210
The man's got maybe 30
square feet of lawn, right?

6
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:06,878
He's on a lawn tractor!

7
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,046
I believe you.

8
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,214
Lawn tractor.

9
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,449
Come back to bed.

10
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:11,984
I can't sleep!

11
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:13,051
The noise!

12
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,253
I mean, listen
to that thing!

13
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:17,456
It sounds like
a 20-ton jackhammer!

14
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:20,993
Well, then go downstairs

15
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:22,294
and tell him to stop.

16
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,329
That's the neighbor
from hell.

17
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:27,165
He was in the marines
for 15 years.

18
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,433
You saw the movie Rambo.

19
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:31,270
We gotta consider
the Rambo factor here.

20
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:35,941
Arlo, why don't you
go downstairs and talk to him

21
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,443
or, better yet,
come back to bed.

22
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,444
You shouldn't
just stand there

23
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,113
getting yourself
all worked up.

24
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:44,416
You know what happens.
Your nose starts bleeding.

25
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,918
My nose bled once.

26
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,953
Once!

27
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,188
For 5 days.

28
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,028
Shit!

29
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,274
Arlo: They're called
rocket launchers.

30
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:11,410
Mm-hmm.
How many you want?

31
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:13,612
Oh, I want
a dozen of 'em.

32
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:14,246
Boy: Ok.

33
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:16,014
I knew I could
count on you.

34
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:18,984
Monica: Marshall?
Yes?

35
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,186
It's your turn
to feed flipper.

36
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,421
Come on.

37
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:25,090
Ok.

38
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:33,632
Wait a minute.
There's Whitney Houston!

39
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,233
Daddy, please.

40
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,368
Well, I didn't believe it.

41
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,303
It was Whitney Houston.

42
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:39,204
Hi, mom.

43
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,305
Hi, sweetheart.

44
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:41,540
I can have
the car today, right?

45
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,508
Wrong.
You may not.

46
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,344
You know, I really would
like to know what the use

47
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,946
of having a license is
if I can't drive.

48
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:50,415
Girlfriend,
I need my car today.

49
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,250
Ok? I have my art class,

50
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:54,319
and then I have
choir rehearsal.

51
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:55,721
Dad, how about you?

52
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:56,588
Can I borrow
your car

53
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,223
and you take
the bus to work?

54
00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,624
Um, let me get this right.

55
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,994
You take my $24,000
brand-new saab,

56
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:05,197
and I take the bus.
Is that your plan?

57
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,498
Yeah. Can I?

58
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,035
Mmm. I have to
mull that over.

59
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:12,270
I think not.

60
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:14,339
Daddy.

61
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,476
You know, Natalie townsend
has her own car.

62
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:18,610
Then your problem's solved.

63
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,512
You ride to school
with Natalie townsend.

64
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,649
That's not funny.

65
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,651
You know, you're
treating me like a child.

66
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,587
Well, I wonder why.

67
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:32,023
Ok. Just wait till
I'm 18, and I'm gone.

68
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,692
You're gonna be
out of my pocket?

69
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:36,228
Great!

70
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,263
I'm going. Mmm.

71
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,030
See you guys!

72
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,899
Boys: Bye.
Bye, sweetie.

73
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:48,106
Good morning,
Mr. pear.

74
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,308
Good morning, Victor.

75
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,780
Take care
of my baby.

76
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:56,314
You bet.

77
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:09,261
I'll help you
with that, ma'am.

78
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,328
Oh, why, thank you.

79
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,696
You hold this
for me.

80
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,498
Yes.

81
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,933
Thanks.

82
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:16,868
Hunh!

83
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,841
Excuse me.

84
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,178
You work out?

85
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,346
No. I used to.

86
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,282
Well, you gotta
keep at it.

87
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,917
No pain, no gain.

88
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,285
Oh, really?

89
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:36,087
I have
a different motto.

90
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,322
No pain...

91
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:38,890
Sounds good to me.

92
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:42,861
Well,
this is me.

93
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,696
Me, too.

94
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,398
Oh.

95
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,866
You work here?

96
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,701
Starting today.

97
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,136
Huh. Welcome aboard.

98
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:51,937
Arlo pear.

99
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,171
Oh, Helen fredericks.

100
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,272
Listen, why don't
you just leave that

101
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:57,275
with the receptionist,
and I'll pick it up later.

102
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:58,977
Ok. I'll do that.

103
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:00,745
Arlo: I do all
our mass transit stuff,

104
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:03,348
you know, bus lines,
subway, stuff like that?

105
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,984
It's a battle to the death--
me versus gridlock.

106
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,886
Helen:
Sounds very exciting.

107
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:09,421
Oh, it is.
Good morning.

108
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:11,289
How ya doin'?
Morning, John.

109
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:11,890
John: Hi.

110
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:14,826
You're gonna like it here.
Everybody's real nice.

111
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,895
Well, this is where I live.

112
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,797
Feel free
to stop by anytime.

113
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:22,100
Woman: Poor guy.
He doesn't know yet.

114
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,068
Helen: Oh...

115
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,803
Arlo, arlo, relax.

116
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:27,072
Now, this isn't easy
for me, either.

117
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,707
Who's the woman?

118
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,276
Name's Helen.
Helen fredericks.

119
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:34,079
She, uh, works
with Jansen.

120
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:36,848
So, the merger
went through.

121
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:38,950
Yeah, the merger
went through.

122
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,219
We signed the deal
Friday night.

123
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,220
Congratulations!

124
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:44,990
You got a bulb
burnt out here, Roy.

125
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,026
Arlo, listen...

126
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,094
With a merger
like this,

127
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51,563
there are
always certain...

128
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:52,330
Changes.

129
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,164
Don't bullshit me.

130
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,268
Roy, if you're gonna
let me go, just tell me.

131
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,403
Arlo, I'm sorry.

132
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,405
So, that's it?

133
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,807
After 15 years?

134
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:07,078
Arlo, listen,
this is, uh--

135
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,047
this is
my home number, huh?

136
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,116
Why don't you call me
if you need a little--

137
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:13,852
any assistance,
anything.

138
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,523
Fuck you, Roy!

139
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:21,059
After 15 years!

140
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,994
Fuck you!

141
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,196
The wrong finger.

142
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,432
I gave the man
the wrong finger!

143
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,234
Sweetheart,
it's all right!

144
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,902
No, it's not.
I stood in his face

145
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,103
for 10 minutes
arguing

146
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,839
and held up
my index finger.

147
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:35,807
The wrong finger!

148
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:36,808
Arlo, sit down.

149
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,211
Listen to me.
Don't torture yourself.

150
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:40,979
Ok? We'll be fine.

151
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:43,515
You are a terrific
transportation engineer,

152
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:45,116
one of the best
in the country.

153
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,351
Now, tomorrow morning,

154
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,053
we'll put a new résumé
together,

155
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:48,954
and by the end of the week,

156
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,922
you'll have your choice
of jobs. You'll see.

157
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,892
I gave him
the wrong finger!

158
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,234
I said on the porch!

159
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,069
Is this a porch?

160
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:07,138
Huh? Does it look
like a porch to you?

161
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,975
It looks like
a shrub to me!

162
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:12,277
Now pay attention!

163
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,578
Shrub!

164
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,314
Green, leafy!

165
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,416
Shrub!

166
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,552
Porch!

167
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:22,988
Flat, concrete,

168
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,557
hard, brick!

169
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,092
Porch!

170
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,095
Shrub!

171
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:31,563
Porch!

172
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:33,932
You got it now,
soldier?! Huh?

173
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:37,302
Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.

174
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,436
Hey!

175
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:40,038
What are you
starin' at?

176
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,272
Get in
the house, boys.

177
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:43,308
Come on. Don't make
eye contact.

178
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,477
Is your old man still
lookin' for a job?

179
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:48,613
Tell him we could use
a good paperboy around here!

180
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:51,416
This kid ain't cuttin' it!

181
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:05,964
I'm calling
about the ginsu knives.

182
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,634
Arlo pear.

183
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:15,473
P...E...A...R.

184
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,377
He won't remember me.

185
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,111
Sure he will.

186
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:22,313
He danced with you
3 times that night.

187
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,582
But, Natalie,
he's different.

188
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:26,317
I mean, look at him.

189
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,585
Will you shut up
and get in there?

190
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:29,120
Come on, move your feet.
Left, right.

191
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,322
That's it.
It's called walking.

192
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:34,359
No problem.
You got it.

193
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,362
Hi. Can I help you?

194
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,997
I'm just looking.

195
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:41,132
Hey, we met
at the party.

196
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,267
Party?

197
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,102
Right. At Duane's house.
I'm Kevin.

198
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,970
Oh, yeah, right.

199
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,640
I thought I'd never
find you again.

200
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:50,442
Really?

201
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:51,309
I wanted to call you,

202
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:52,610
but I didn't know
your number.

203
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,345
Well, it's
in the book.

204
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,081
I didn't know
your name.

205
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,348
Well, that's
in the book, too.

206
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,051
How about puttin' it
in this book?

207
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,319
Ok.

208
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,993
Ok. Bye.

209
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,495
Bye.

210
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,199
- So, what happened?
- Come on.

211
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,201
We're going
out Friday night!

212
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:17,168
Oh, Casey,
that's great!

213
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,104
I know, and he has
his own apartment.

214
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,071
Oh, that's
even better.

215
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,173
Yes, and he goes
to fairleigh Dickinson,

216
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:24,075
and he's majoring
in pharmacy.

217
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,176
Oh, right, right,
sure.

218
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:29,047
I can just see you
living on a farm.

219
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,291
Man, on megaphone:
Arlo pear.

220
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:44,496
Stand away from that car.

221
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:47,532
Yeah. You, move it!

222
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,348
Man: Ha ha ha!
I fooled you, didn't I?

223
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,450
And now we go in
for the kill!

224
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,385
You're not going
anywhere, pear.

225
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:11,289
I got you right
where I want you!

226
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,323
Cut it out, Frank!

227
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,325
It's just you
and me now, sport.

228
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,227
What's your problem,
Frank?!

229
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,363
I'll tell you
what my problem is.

230
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,297
I have a brain tumor.

231
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,299
I'll tell you
what my problem is.

232
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,901
I have a brain tumor!

233
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,416
cut the shit, Frank!

234
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,660
Arlo?

235
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,695
Honey, telephone.

236
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,968
Ohh!

237
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,539
Mayday, mayday.
We've been hit. We're going in.

238
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,273
Mayday, mayday.

239
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:05,310
Honey, I'm going.
See ya later.

240
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,177
Who is it?

241
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,447
Yes, this is arlo pear.
What do you want?

242
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,816
What?

243
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:13,751
Yes, I'd be interested.

244
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:19,190
Well, that was
very nice of him.

245
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,726
Yes, I know where that is.

246
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:25,730
Yes, an hour? I could
be there in an hour.

247
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,566
I'll see you then.

248
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:31,102
Thank you very much.

249
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,240
Whoo! Ho ho ho!

250
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:36,507

00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:39,477
Yoww! Hey! Ohh!

Good luck.

253
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,187
Thank you, Judy.

254
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:51,155
Arlo pear.
Yes, sir.

255
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:52,357
Hi. Simon eberhard.

256
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,458
Gee, I'm glad
you could make it.

257
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,426
I've wanted
to meet you for years.

258
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,127
Have a seat.

259
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:57,428
Can I get you
anything? Coffee?

260
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,464
No, Mr. eberhard.
Thank you very much.

261
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:00,665
Please, call me Simon.

262
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:03,735
We're gonna be working
together every day.

263
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,536
Excuse me.

264
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,140
Would you find Gary?

265
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,442
Tell him arlo pear's here.

266
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:14,145
That's Gary Marcus,
chairman of the board.

267
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:17,348
Canceled a flight today
so he could meet you.

268
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,685
Now, let's see,
you're the man who does--

269
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,055
where is he?

270
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,190
Hi. Gary Marcus.

271
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,526
Heard nothing but
great things about you.

272
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:29,460
Welcome to g.T.I.

273
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,296
Have you been
filling in our friend?

274
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:32,430
Well, yeah,
I was just about to.

275
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,732
Um, here, arlo.
Take a look at this.

276
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:37,602
We call it
the phase one shuttle.

277
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,604
It's a fully automated
monorail commuter train,

278
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,373
the fastest, most advanced
train in the world.

279
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,642
180 Miles an hour.

280
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:47,211
Who's gonna drive
this thing, my wife?

281
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,685
Arlo,
we want you to head

282
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:55,787
our research and
development division.

283
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,155
You'll have
complete autonomy.

284
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:58,289
You can set your own staff,

285
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,625
set your own schedule,
whatever you want.

286
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:01,859
Let's be
perfectly Frank, arlo.

287
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:02,827
I'm sure there
are a number

288
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,363
of other offers
that you're considering.

289
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:05,730
Mmm...

290
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:08,666
Arlo, we know what you
were getting at Metro,

291
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,935
and this job pays
20,000 more.

292
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,470
We'll treat you
like a king.

293
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,938
Full staff,
secretaries.

294
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,440
Stock options,
profit sharing.

295
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,675
Expense accounts,
state-of-the-art equipment.

296
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:20,812
Arlo, whatever you want,
you got it.

297
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,647
I personally
guarantee it.

298
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,915
How's that sound?

299
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,783
Terrific. Well,

300
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:27,385
I guess the first thing
on the agenda

301
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,619
is we gotta
get him out there

302
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,288
as soon as possible.

303
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,157
Out there?

304
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,595
Didn't someone
talk about this?

305
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,631
Well, no, I...

306
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,003
Well, it was probably
just an oversight.

307
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:49,240
Arlo, the job
is in Boise.

308
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,477
Boise.

309
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,511
Great.

310
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,214
Idaho.

311
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:57,882
Idaho.

312
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:58,649
Great.

313
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,918
That's where
we're headquartered.

314
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,220
That's where the prototype

315
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,188
for the shuttle is.

316
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,825
Simon: Oh, we'll do
everything that we can.

317
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,227
Your wife
is gonna love it.

318
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:11,295
We'll fly both of you
out there next week,

319
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:12,730
help you find a home, huh?

320
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,832
Arlo, I lived
in Idaho all my life.

321
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,635
It's beautiful country.
Great fishing.

322
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:18,936
Do you like
the outdoors?

323
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:22,306
Is it outdoors?

324
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,275
Well...

325
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,676
This is a big decision.

326
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,712
Maybe you wanna go home
and talk it over

327
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,781
with the wife and family.

328
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,983
Monica: Come on, case.

329
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:33,451
I already bought you
a ticket.

330
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,853
No, mom, I'm sorry.
I can't come hear you sing.

331
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:36,954
I've made other plans.

332
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,356
Marshall: Other plans
with Kevin?

333
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:41,726
We saw what you and Kevin
were doing last night.

334
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,928
Both:

335
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:46,998
Casey: Shut up.
Shut up!

336
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,435
Dad, will you please
tell them to shut up?

337
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,539
Well, why don't you
invite Kevin?

338
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,441
Oh, right, mom.
That's a fun date,

339
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:59,977
to bring my boyfriend
to hear my mother sing soprano?

340
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:02,180
I don't think so.

341
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,517
Darling...

342
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,687
These potatoes
are delicious.

343
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,956
Thank you, sweetie.

344
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,858
Um, do you have enough?

345
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,862
You know...

346
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:19,797
Kevin just might
enjoy it.

347
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,833
No, mom.

348
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:26,437
Are these Idaho potatoes?

349
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:28,806
I don't know, arlo.

350
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:32,944
I bet they are. I bet
these are Idaho potatoes.

351
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:35,613
I know.

352
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,747
Why don't you tape it,

353
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,516
and I'll listen to it later.

354
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,952
It's the country's
leading producer

355
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,653
of silver, you know.

356
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:43,421
Monica: What is?

357
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:47,325
I'm sorry. I thought we
were talking about Idaho.

358
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:52,830
Dad, are you all right?

359
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:53,798
Yeah, I'm fine.

360
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,567
But I read an article
this afternoon,

361
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:57,435
about Idaho,

362
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,537
our 43rd state,
the gem state.

363
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:04,108
Which, by the way, is where
Whitney Houston was born.

364
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,477
No, she wasn't.
She was born right here,

365
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,879
in New Jersey.

366
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,048
Well, she sang so good,

367
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,318
you'd think she was
born in Idaho.

368
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:17,455
What's going on here?

369
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,826
Arlo...

370
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,661
You got a job!

371
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:24,929
Maybe.

372
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,065
With who, the Idaho
tourist bureau?

373
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:31,068
No. I'd be honored
if it were, but, ahem...

374
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,871
It's this company
called g.T.I. Transit.

375
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:37,141
It's a new opportunity,
a big raise.

376
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:39,110
Well, there's more.
What is it?

377
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:41,712
Well, I didn't
tell them yes.

378
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,314
Well, what is it?

379
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:48,152
I didn't tell them yes.

380
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:49,720
Well, what?

381
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,556
It's
in Boise, Idaho.

382
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:54,892
Bois--did you say
Boise, Idaho?

383
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:56,494
No way!
Boise!

384
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,601
Arlo, come on, now.
That's not fair!

385
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:04,869
You promised me!

386
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,238
No way. There's no way.

387
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:07,972
No way I'm moving.

388
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:10,975
The phone hasn't been
ringing off the hook,

389
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,143
ladies and gentlemen.

390
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:13,077
You can commute.

391
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:16,080
To Idaho?
Baby, it's 2,000 Miles.

392
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:16,981
It's not fair.

393
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:18,716
This is my last year
of school.

394
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,118
I have Kevin here
and all my friends.

395
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,153
I know, baby,

396
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:23,854
but it's not that easy.

397
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,957
Well, there's no way
I'm moving.

398
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,024
No fucking way!

399
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:27,692
Wait a minute!

400
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,728
That's a quarter in
the swear jar, young lady.

401
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,029
Fine.

402
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:36,968
25 cents in the swear jar?

403
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:37,702
Here's $1.00, dad.

404
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,604
Because there's no goddamn way
I'm goddamn movin'

405
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41,138
to any son-of-a-bitch,
shit-eating,

406
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:45,409
goddamn-Ida,
goddamn, shitty-ho!

407
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,147
That's...

408
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:04,962
Leave the room.

409
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:08,499
Arlo: Well, you guys,
don't you want dessert?

410
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:10,601
Both: Oh, yeah!

411
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,236
Now!

412
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:15,706
Wait a minute. I helped
you guys last week.

413
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,475
Cowards!

414
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,610
I love this house.

415
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:20,811
Arlo: So do I.

416
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:23,014
I love this town.

417
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:25,182
I love our friends.

418
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:26,484
I don't wanna move.

419
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:29,487
I don't wanna move,
either, baby,

420
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:30,855
but things change.

421
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:33,791
You could always work
for my father.

422
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,460
I'm sure that offer's
still good.

423
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:38,729
Making mustard.

424
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:41,265
But you wouldn't be
making mustard.

425
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,868
You'd be
supervising people.

426
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,704
Who are making mustard.

427
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:50,608
I am a transportation
engineer.

428
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,910
That's what I do.

429
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:55,446
That's what I do.

430
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:59,583
This job offer out there...

431
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:01,519
It's a good job, huh?

432
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:06,057
Once in a lifetime.

433
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:12,430
I can't believe
I'm moving again.

434
00:22:16,102 --> 00:22:17,768
No, not this time.

435
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,237
I'm gonna take care
of everything.

436
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,874
If they kiss,
we're dead.

437
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,210
You swear?

438
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,654
That's it.

439
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:39,123
We're moving.

440
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:44,128
Arlo: All right, ladies
and gentlemen, listen up.

441
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,296
We're gonna take
it from the top,

442
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:48,866
and this time, I want
some feeling in it, ok?

443
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,502
Operation Idaho.

444
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:55,106
5 weeks to go,
and what's the plan?

445
00:22:55,108 --> 00:22:58,075
All: We sell the house
for as much as we can.

446
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:01,212
And what do we do
with 4 weeks to go?

447
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,681
Buy a new house in Idaho.

448
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:05,883
3 weeks to go,
what do you say?

449
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,786
Clean up the attic
and throw stuff away.

450
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:12,390
2 weeks to go,
and the big yard sale...

451
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:15,693
Arrange with the mailman
to forward the mail!

452
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:18,329
One week to go,
and what's the job?

453
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:21,065
Hire somebody
to drive the saab!

454
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,934
Moving day, and we're
out of Jersey!

455
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:28,239
We're gonna start a new life
in a town called Boise!

456
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,107
Great! That was excellent!

457
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:33,244
Hey, case. Fries
or onion rings?

458
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:34,678
Fries.

459
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,380
Have you told him yet?

460
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:37,782
No!

461
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:38,682
Why not?

462
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,885
Because I'm not moving.

463
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:42,253
What do you mean?

464
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:44,789
I mean I'm not moving.

465
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:48,225
Even if I have to
kill someone.

466
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,406
Where did you
get him, coach?

467
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:05,242
It ain't over
till it's over.

468
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:19,290
Come on, Freddy, go!

469
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:20,324
One more lap!

470
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:22,092
Come on,
let's go, Randy!

471
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:23,861
One more lap, baby!

472
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:24,428
You can do it!

473
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,931
You've done it before!
Let's go!

474
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:02,700
I can't believe
you're leaving me!

475
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:04,335
Woman: As you can see,

476
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:05,736
the entire house
is very sunny.

477
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,738
It's wonderful
for plants.

478
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,106
Philip, wouldn't
our brown couch

479
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:09,874
look good in here?

480
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:12,443
Uh-huh, and, honey,
look at the paneling.

481
00:25:12,445 --> 00:25:16,213
And here are the 2
downstairs bedrooms.

482
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:17,281
Sounds like
they like it.

483
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:18,983
If they make an offer,
let me do the talking.

484
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:22,186
Don't even nod your head.
I'll handle everything.

485
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,888
Ok.

486
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:28,125
Aah! Oh, my God! Aah!

487
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:32,229
Oh, my God!

488
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:37,301
What the hell?

489
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:57,321
Where's Casey?

490
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:02,793
Ohh, stop...

491
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:04,395
Stop what?

492
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:06,263
Stop me.

493
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:11,769
What's this?

494
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:16,040
Oh, I was just doing
some work around the house.

495
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,475
Monica: You'll love
the kitchen.

496
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:22,179
It has all the
top-of-the-line appliances.

497
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:23,047
Oh, this is our stove.

498
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:26,317
It has the grill and a fan
with a downdraft.

499
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:27,017
It's great.

500
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:31,922
And over here, this operates
the garbage disposal.

501
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,223
Arlo: What--

502
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:58,248
Ohh!

503
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,785
Casey!
Casey!

504
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,126
Here they are!

505
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:15,065
Is that
a working fireplace?

506
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:17,468
Yes, it is.
We use it all winter.

507
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,902
Very nice, very nice.

508
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:20,404
This would
be perfect for us.

509
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:21,839
Well, I'm glad
you like it.

510
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:23,040
Why don't you
come outside here?

511
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,041
I'll show you
the barbecue--

512
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:26,343
um, uh, where
does this go?

513
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:27,244
Oh, it's
just a basement.

514
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:28,579
You've seen one,
you've seen 'em all.

515
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:30,114
Well, could we
have a look at it?

516
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:31,949
Look at that? Jesus!

517
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:34,585
It's just a--just
a storage area now,

518
00:27:34,587 --> 00:27:36,553
you know,
washing machine, dryer.

519
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:38,622
Well, we'd still
like to see it.

520
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,924
Oh, but, no!

521
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:42,226
You see,
it's a mess.

522
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:43,327
It's--damn watch!

523
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,295
Is there a problem
with the basement?

524
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:46,430
No, there's
no problem

525
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:47,197
with the basement,

526
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:49,633
except to be honest
with you, uh,

527
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:50,901
the door is stuck.

528
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:52,569
It's been stuck
for 6 months.

529
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:54,038
I've tried
to open it.

530
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,638
You can't open it.

531
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,573
Well, let--
but you can't.

532
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:57,875
Well, I'll just
give it a try.

533
00:27:57,877 --> 00:27:59,176
I know you'll
give it a try--

534
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,210
here, I'll just--

535
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:02,112
well, I'll just--

536
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:03,247
wow!

537
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:04,581
That's--honey!

538
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:05,182
Well, uh,

539
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,951
we should've had you
here 6 months ago.

540
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:09,386
At least.

541
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:11,455
Well,
we're going.

542
00:28:11,457 --> 00:28:13,424
Yeah, let's
have a look.

543
00:28:13,426 --> 00:28:17,361
Well, this is
the garage door.

544
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:20,130
And the basement
is really dry...

545
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:21,432
Oh, my God.
Who's that?

546
00:28:21,434 --> 00:28:23,000
Oh, that's
our daughter Casey.

547
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:24,468
Hi, honey.
These are the seegers.

548
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,570
We'll be taking the washer
and dryer with us.

549
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:29,573
What are you doing
to this child?!

550
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:31,542
Oh...

551
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:32,576
She's a student.

552
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:34,511
It's
a class project.

553
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:35,279
Class project?

554
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:38,148
Yeah. She's studying
sensory deprivation.

555
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,717
She's doing
a damn good job.

556
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,118
She's gonna get
an "a."

557
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:41,952
Aren't you, dear?

558
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:42,686
We'll be
out of your way

559
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:44,221
in just a minute,
sweetheart.

560
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:46,123
Yeah. Uh-huh.

561
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:46,690
Come on this way.

562
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:49,359
This here
is the storage room.

563
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,399
Well, Mr. pear,

564
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,600
now, uh...

565
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:58,235
About your asking price.

566
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:01,271
Yes, um,

567
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:03,974
how firm is it?

568
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:04,541
Ahem.

569
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:06,610
Well, we have had
other interest.

570
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:09,279
Heh heh. But we'd be
willing to consider

571
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:13,050
anything,
say, within 5%.

572
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:17,554
My God.

573
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:20,724
Uh, of course,
that is negotiable.

574
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:21,291
Arlo?

575
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:24,561
Frank, what in the hell
are you doing here?

576
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:26,029
Hey, neighbor.

577
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:28,098
I saw the car
parked out front.

578
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,700
Somebody looking
at the house?

579
00:29:29,702 --> 00:29:30,601
Yes, they are. Uh...

580
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:33,036
Can you come back
in 10 minutes, please?

581
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:34,138
Just thought
I'd say hi.

582
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,672
That's the kind
of guy I am.

583
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:37,608
They're showing
a snuff film

584
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,342
on cable, Frank.

585
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:40,110
Why don't you
check it out?

586
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:42,579
Frank, don't go
in the house.

587
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:44,448
Frank. Frank.

588
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:48,685
Mrs. pear.

589
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:50,888
Hi. I-I'm Frank Crawford.

590
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,523
Hi. I live right next-door.

591
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:54,725
Larry seeger.
This is my wife Cleo.

592
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:56,093
Hi.
Cleo.

593
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:58,796
Oh, what
a beautiful name.

594
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:00,430
You know, one of
the, uh, women

595
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:02,432
that I work with
at the teen center

596
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:03,333
is named Cleo.

597
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:05,269
Get him out of here!

598
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:05,769
Ok.

599
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:07,137
Cleo: Really?
Frank: Mm-hmm.

600
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,739
Frank has to
be going now.

601
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:10,073
Do you play golf,
Larry?

602
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:12,476
Larry: Well, I try.

603
00:30:12,545 --> 00:30:14,144
Well, you know,
there's a new course

604
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,113
that just opened up
down the road.

605
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:17,114
And maybe you and me,

606
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:19,183
we could break it in
together sometime.

607
00:30:19,185 --> 00:30:20,217
Oh...

608
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:21,185
It's a deal.

609
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:22,286
Oh, I almost forgot.

610
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:23,620
It's--heh--
a little welcome

611
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:25,255
to the neighborhood
gift.

612
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:26,223
Aren't you sweet.

613
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:27,791
It's a bundt cake.

614
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:28,692
Mmm...

615
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:29,560
It's, uh...

616
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:31,728
My mother's recipe.

617
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,230
Cleo: Thank you.

618
00:30:33,232 --> 00:30:34,264
Larry: Say, arlo,

619
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:37,301
how much did you pay
this guy to come over?

620
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:38,769
Ha ha ha.

621
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:39,403
Frank?

622
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:40,804
Oh, I couldn't
pay him enough,

623
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:41,772
could I, Frank?

624
00:30:41,774 --> 00:30:44,174
Money? No, thanks.

625
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,610
Uh, listen, Frank,
could I talk to you?

626
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:47,711
Certainly, neighbor.

627
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:49,346
I'm at your disposal.

628
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,814
So, if you'll
excuse us.

629
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:51,548
Uh-huh.

630
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,150
Very nice meeting you--

631
00:30:53,152 --> 00:30:55,619
oh, heh--
meeting you both.

632
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:56,653
And, um...

633
00:30:56,655 --> 00:31:00,324
Real pleasure.
You go ahead.

634
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:01,391
Nice to meet you.

635
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:02,226
Nice meeting you, too.

636
00:31:02,228 --> 00:31:04,061
I'm gonna do
a little refurbishing

637
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:05,429
on the house, so, uh,

638
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:07,097
I hope it won't
disturb you.

639
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:07,631
Oh, come on.

640
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:08,665
Don't forget
it's a date.

641
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:11,335
Oh, yeah, we--
right there.

642
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,440
Mrs. pear.

643
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:21,078
Frank! Come here!

644
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,480
Jesus Christ!
What are you doing?!

645
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:25,649
I'd say I'm selling
your house.

646
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:26,283
Why?!

647
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:28,452
Because you people
bore me.

648
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:29,653
I want you out!

649
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:32,456
I crave new blood.

650
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,658
Ain't you gonna
peel that?

651
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,759
I know what's in it.

652
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:37,661
Jesus,
that's disgusting.

653
00:31:37,663 --> 00:31:38,795
- Mr. pear.
- Hi.

654
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:41,498
Arlo, we've
talked it over,

655
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,700
and we'd like to
make you an offer.

656
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,370
Oh, that's great.

657
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:47,704
Great!

658
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:51,541
Mom, we're coming back
as soon as we find a house.

659
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:53,176
We're not gonna
go stay this time.

660
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:54,311
Randy: May we have
our own bedroom?

661
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:55,312
Marshall:
Can we buy this one?

662
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:56,713
We're gonna do
the best we can

663
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:57,648
to get you
your own room,

664
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,383
but I need the book.
We gotta go.

665
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:00,717
Come on, guys. Unh.

666
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:02,352
Oh! Pull!

667
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:02,853
There you go.

668
00:32:02,855 --> 00:32:04,621
Hey, take care
of your sister, ok?

669
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:05,622
She's not
feeling well.

670
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:07,157
Ok.
I'll see you guys.

671
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:07,624
Ok, bye.

672
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:08,859
Oh, mother,
thank you.

673
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:10,494
We really
appreciate this.

674
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,194
Come on, dear.

675
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:12,763
We gotta get going.
We're gonna be late.

676
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:13,897
See you, dad.

677
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:16,233
Take care, ok?

678
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:21,038
I don't even know
where Idaho is.

679
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:32,215
Monica: Sounds perfect.

680
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:34,318
It's "4 bedrooms,
sunken living room,

681
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,322
with fireplace,
needs some work."

682
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:51,868
And this, naturally,
is the living room.

683
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:55,605
Probably your dream house,
isn't it, dear?

684
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:57,708
Of course,
you'd probably

685
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,843
decorate it
differently.

686
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:03,547
Oh, yes. We'd get
bigger penises.

687
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:04,948
Oh, arlo, this is great.

688
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:08,285
And they have 4 bedrooms.
Can you believe it?

689
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:09,286
You know how much

690
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:12,556
this place would cost
back in Jersey?

691
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:14,291
Oh, God.

692
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:15,859
Look at these windows.

693
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:18,228
My plants
are gonna love it here.

694
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:18,829
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

695
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:20,864
We're taking
all the windows with us.

696
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,335
Oh, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

697
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,270
I'm a joker.
I'm a nut.

698
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:31,842
Come on in the kitchen.
I'll show you the kitchen.

699
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:36,380
Yeah, I built
these cabinets myself.

700
00:33:36,382 --> 00:33:38,281
They're beautiful.

701
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:39,750
And tiles. Look.

702
00:33:39,752 --> 00:33:40,450
And 2 sinks.

703
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:42,953
Yeah, unfortunately,
we're takin' 'em with us.

704
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:45,555
No, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

705
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:47,657
Oh, he's irrepressible.

706
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:48,425
I like your jokes,

707
00:33:48,427 --> 00:33:49,726
but the listing
said something

708
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:50,927
about a new
heating system?

709
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:52,462
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That's right.

710
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:53,563
New furnace. Gas.

711
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:55,265
Forced hot air.
Very efficient.

712
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:57,601
Come on out
in the backyard.

713
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:01,938
Do you like
these doors?

714
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,773
I love 'em.
Sorry.

715
00:34:02,775 --> 00:34:04,608
We're taking
all the doors with us.

716
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:09,479
His material sucks,
but I like his delivery.

717
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:13,250
I don't care, arlo.
I want this house.

718
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:17,721
Arlo: It's beautiful!

719
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:19,790
You know, I have lived
in 14 different houses

720
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:21,658
and I've never had
my own pool.

721
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,826
And I've
always wanted one

722
00:34:22,828 --> 00:34:24,394
ever since
I was a little girl.

723
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:27,364
Well, sister, I've got
some bad news for you.

724
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:30,400
All:
We're taking it with us!

725
00:34:31,804 --> 00:34:33,336
I really like
to joke, Roger,

726
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:37,941
but I'd like to talk to you
about financing this house.

727
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:38,742
Terrific, terrific.

728
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,010
Why don't we leave
the little ladies here,

729
00:34:40,012 --> 00:34:42,512
you and I will go inside
and talk about it.

730
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:45,048
God, this is great,
Alice, great.

731
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,316
Thank you.
Well, we love it.

732
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:48,018
So you found
your dream house,

733
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,519
and right now
you're asking

734
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:51,021
first Boise
savings and loan

735
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:52,923
to give you a mortgage.

736
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:53,657
As you can see,

737
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,826
I've had the same job
for 15 years.

738
00:34:55,828 --> 00:34:58,128
Well, that's very nice,
but it's not enough.

739
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,430
I mean, Al Capone
had the same job

740
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:01,832
for 30 years.

741
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,367
But we've never had
any problem with credit.

742
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:05,035
Oh, don't get me wrong.

743
00:35:05,037 --> 00:35:07,104
I trust you.
We trust all our customers.

744
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:09,739
Why, this bank
was built on trust.

745
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:11,541
Here. Sign here.

746
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:14,911
You gotta get closer.
This pen is chained down.

747
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:17,514
Woman: Mr. Hanks,

748
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:19,483
Mr. Wilson wants to
see you right away,

749
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:21,685
and he wants you to
bring all your records

750
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:23,420
for the last 5 years.

751
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:26,590
I'll be there
as soon as I can.

752
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:28,625
Whoo, I see you got twins.

753
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:29,893
Hey, I'm one of twins.

754
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:31,595
I'll tell you, though,
my twin brother,

755
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:32,562
he's not too smart.

756
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:35,132
I mean, last year,
he forgot my birthday.

757
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:39,402
Woman:
Mr. Wilson is waiting!

758
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:40,871
Is something wrong?

759
00:35:40,873 --> 00:35:42,739
Oh, no, everything is ok.

760
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,474
Your application is fine.

761
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,844
But right now
I can't give you any money.

762
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:49,412
When can you
give us the money?

763
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:52,549
Mr. pear, are you
a gambling man?

764
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:54,050
No, I'm not.

765
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:55,552
Well, you are now.

766
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:57,587
Look, I'm gonna level
with you people.

767
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:58,889
I just spent
a big chunk

768
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:00,524
of the bank's money
on Hannah blue

769
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:02,492
in the seventh
at hallmark downs.

770
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:03,093
That's embezzlement.

771
00:36:03,095 --> 00:36:04,828
That's right,
and that's exactly

772
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,763
what I've been doing here
for 22 years.

773
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:09,032
But I'll tell you,
this horse can't lose.

774
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:11,468
You'll get your money
for the house.

775
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,068
I did my homework.

776
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,671
This horse has never lost
on a wet track.

777
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:15,805
Announcer:
I can't remember

778
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:18,608
when I've ever seen
a track this dry.

779
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:20,076
And they're off!

780
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:21,912
Lady Paris
gets the early lead,

781
00:36:21,914 --> 00:36:24,514
with Hannah blue second
along the inside...

782
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,016
Hannah blue, baby, come on.

783
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:27,484
Come on, Hannah blue.

784
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:28,618
Move it, move it, move it.

785
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,452
Pass 'em, pass 'em.

786
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:30,487
Go ahead,
Hannah blue, baby, go.

787
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:33,790
Hannah blue, come on, baby.
Oh, God, please, Hannah blue.

788
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:35,992
I'll do anything.
I'll go back to my wife.

789
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:37,827
You heard him, God!
Hannah blue!

790
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:39,829
He said he'd be true
to his wife!

791
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:40,964
Take it easy, will you?

792
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:44,134
I said I'll go back
to my wife.

793
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,047
This application's approved!

794
00:37:04,122 --> 00:37:05,522
Hello.

795
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:07,891
Mr. pear?

796
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:08,792
Yes.

797
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:10,460
How's it hangin'?

798
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:12,195
How's what hangin'?

799
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:13,463
Your dick.

800
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:15,732
Huh? Oh, uh,

801
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,534
it's hangin' to the left.

802
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:20,170
I'm Edwards,
and this is Perry.

803
00:37:20,172 --> 00:37:21,605
We're here
to give you an estimate

804
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:26,810
for the Cortez brothers
moving and storage company.

805
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:29,913
You got anything I can
write with around here?

806
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:30,914
By the phone.

807
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:31,681
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

808
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:33,283
Well, yeah, well,
like I was saying, well,

809
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:35,552
we generally start
upstairs, you know?

810
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:38,555
Upstairs. Ok. Um...

811
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:41,858
Ahem.

812
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,760
Ok, we got here
the bedroom, huh?

813
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:46,730
Master bedroom, bed,
2 tables--

814
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:47,864
antique tables?

815
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:48,465
Uh, yeah.

816
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:49,599
That's
an antique clock, too.

817
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:50,934
Probably worth
a lot of money, huh?

818
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:52,636
Yeah, I suppose so.

819
00:37:52,638 --> 00:37:55,538
A chest of drawers,
antique lamp.

820
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,707
Hey, this is
a nice suit.

821
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,876
What?
Give me my suit.

822
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:01,511
This doesn't
even fit you.

823
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:02,912
Give me my suit!

824
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:04,014
Jesus!

825
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:08,652
And we got here the, uh,
wardrobe closet, huh?

826
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:10,553
Hey.

827
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:11,721
What?

828
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:13,189
This your wife's underwear?

829
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:14,190
Put that down!

830
00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:15,792
This is going,
too, right?

831
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:16,660
Back up!

832
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:18,261
Give me this!

833
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:19,663
Now...

834
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:21,131
I don't care
what you say.

835
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,332
I want you
out of here right now.

836
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:24,768
I've seen enough
of this shit, ok?

837
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:25,935
Let's go!

838
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:26,803
We got a deal for you.

839
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,038
We come here
to make a deal with you,

840
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,172
and we're gonna
make this deal.

841
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:32,142
Now, we figured
25 cartons.

842
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:34,944
We'll make
the whole move for you

843
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:36,680
from door-to-door,
coast-to-coast.

844
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:38,281
That's loading everything
on the truck

845
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:43,953
and taking it off
for $1,930.

846
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,722
We have your estimate,

847
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:48,458
and I thank you
gentlemen for coming by.

848
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,728
And I'll
show you out now.

849
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:54,264
This is the door.
You remember the door.

850
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:55,298
It works both ways.

851
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,934
Good.
You'll be going out.

852
00:38:57,936 --> 00:39:00,236
What are you doing
in my purse?!

853
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:02,972
Arlo!
He was in my purse!

854
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:03,907
She's lying.
She's crazy.

855
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:05,942
I don't know what's
the matter with your wife.

856
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:06,609
She's lying.

857
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:07,977
What?! Well,
get out of the house!

858
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:08,812
That's it!

859
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:10,780
Edwards: Hey, brother,
why don't you chill out?

860
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:11,781
You know how
this thing goes.

861
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:13,316
We help you out,
and you help us out.

862
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:15,251
Here. There's out.
I helped you.

863
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:16,586
Now get out of my house.

864
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:19,055
Hey, man, I'll smack you
in the mouth.

865
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:20,256
What? You--

866
00:39:20,258 --> 00:39:23,159
and stay out!

867
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:24,894
The shark
son of a bitch.

868
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:27,197
No!

869
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,099
Woman: Uh, Mr. pear?

870
00:39:30,736 --> 00:39:33,703
Oh, hello.
I'm Carol Davenport.

871
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,106
I'm with the hummingbird
moving company.

872
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:38,108
I believe I spoke
with you on the phone.

873
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:41,211
Oh, yeah, uh,
come in, please.

874
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:41,911
Oh, good.

875
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:44,080
Honey,
this is Mrs. Davenport.

876
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:46,082
She's from
hummingbird movers.

877
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:49,018
It's a completely
different company.

878
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,121
She's a professional.

879
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:55,325
Carol: It comes to $2,430.

880
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:58,361
Now, this figure includes
all transportation,

881
00:39:58,363 --> 00:40:00,330
mileage, tolls,
and insurance.

882
00:40:00,332 --> 00:40:04,067
We've just a small fee
for packing and unpacking.

883
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:05,301
Sold.

884
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:06,069
Um, for that fee,

885
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:09,172
will you reassemble all the beds
once we get to Idaho?

886
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:10,340
Absolutely.

887
00:40:10,342 --> 00:40:11,775
We will do everything.

888
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:16,679
You two have enough
to worry about, am I right?

889
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:22,018
Thank you.
Thanks.

890
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,752
Enjoy 'em.

891
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:23,920
How much
for everything?

892
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,021
Wrap it all up.

893
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:28,024
Will that cash
or charge, sir?

894
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:30,293
Come on, arlo.
Give me the tour.

895
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:31,795
Ok, come on, Arnie.

896
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:33,029
Monica:
Well, you can see

897
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:34,664
we never
throw anything out.

898
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:35,331
You look around here,

899
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:38,001
you can tell this is
the sale of the century.

900
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:40,970
Well, at least
the sale of the decade.

901
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:43,239
285, 286...

902
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:46,676
Monica: Believe me, ma'am.
They're all there.

903
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:49,646
It says 1,000 pieces.

904
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:52,382
Well, I'm sure
they're all there.

905
00:40:52,384 --> 00:40:55,151
287, 288...

906
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:56,986
Uh, how much for this?

907
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:57,887
This? Oh, this?

908
00:40:57,889 --> 00:41:00,223
I'll pay you
to take this.

909
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:03,927
Excuse me.
Does your dog bite?

910
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:08,932
Madam, that dog hasn't
farted since march of '78.

911
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:14,237
Here's some comic books,
mostly D.C.,

912
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:15,338
and here's
some video games.

913
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:19,976
And here's some pictures
of my sister...Naked.

914
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,780
I'll give you 140 for it.

915
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:26,916
Frank:
I'll give you 150.

916
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:28,885
170.

917
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:31,187
200.

918
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:34,257
Sorry. That's
too steep for me.

919
00:41:37,896 --> 00:41:41,231
Nah.
I changed my mind.

920
00:41:53,812 --> 00:41:56,112
There you go, kid,
a nice, short fuse for you.

921
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:59,782
All right, boys,
more bang for the buck.

922
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:00,283
Here we go.

923
00:42:00,285 --> 00:42:02,952
Randy, Marshall,
put those m-80s down.

924
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:05,488
Get back
to your own yard, ok?

925
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,490
Wipe your feet.

926
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:10,159
Having a mustard sale,
Frank?

927
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:13,897
I hear you folks
are moving out west.

928
00:42:13,899 --> 00:42:15,999
I got a brother
lives out that way.

929
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:18,034
I never visit him,
though.

930
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,135
God-awful country.

931
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:20,470
I'm sorry to hear that,
Frank.

932
00:42:20,472 --> 00:42:22,071
We're gonna miss you.

933
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:22,805
The wife and I,

934
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:24,040
maybe we could send you
a plane ticket.

935
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:27,010
You could come out and
visit us at Christmas.

936
00:42:27,812 --> 00:42:30,146
Could, but I won't.

937
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:35,318
Well, I'd be happy
to drive your car

938
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,519
to Idaho for you,
Mr. pear.

939
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:38,254
In fact,
when I saw your ad

940
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:39,856
up on the bulletin board
at school,

941
00:42:39,858 --> 00:42:40,990
I couldn't believe it.

942
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:42,926
My family lives
right outside of Boise.

943
00:42:42,928 --> 00:42:43,993
I'd be going that way
anyway.

944
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:46,896
Have you ever driven
a turbo saab?

945
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:47,430
Oh, yes, sir.

946
00:42:47,432 --> 00:42:49,165
In fact, coincidentally,
my Uncle owns

947
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,500
a saab dealership
in Illinois.

948
00:42:50,502 --> 00:42:51,968
I used to work there
in the summertime.

949
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:55,338
Well, what did you do
for this Uncle of yours

950
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,906
in the summertime?

951
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,341
Did you sell them?

952
00:42:58,343 --> 00:43:00,043
Oh, no, sir,
I repaired them.

953
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:02,412
I have some references
if you'd like to see them.

954
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:04,414
Ref--you know, I don't
need to see this.

955
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:06,149
Why don't you come on
in the house?

956
00:43:06,151 --> 00:43:07,317
We'll talk about the trip.

957
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:09,185
Hey, I'll fix you
a beer.

958
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:10,253
Oh, I don't drink, sir.

959
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:11,821
Some lemonade
would be fine,

960
00:43:11,823 --> 00:43:13,990
if it's not
too much trouble.

961
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,238
Uhh! Ooh!

962
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:42,819
Ok, well, if you do
hear from him,

963
00:43:42,821 --> 00:43:44,253
tell him to call me.

964
00:43:45,323 --> 00:43:47,857
Ok. I know. Bye.

965
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:54,030
Mrs. arlo pear?

966
00:43:54,032 --> 00:43:54,464
Yes.

967
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:57,166
I'm with
hummingbird movers.

968
00:43:57,168 --> 00:43:58,301
Uh-huh.

969
00:43:58,303 --> 00:43:59,569
I'm the packer.

970
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:11,180
Uh, you know,
you don't have to wrap

971
00:44:11,182 --> 00:44:13,850
each one of those
individually.

972
00:44:13,852 --> 00:44:16,219
Oh, it's no problem.

973
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:18,287
Arlo...

974
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,627
Aah!

975
00:44:24,629 --> 00:44:25,228
Whoa!

976
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:29,766
If daddy doesn't come home,
do we still have to move?

977
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:32,535
Why did you say that?

978
00:44:32,537 --> 00:44:38,007
Casey, have you done
something to your father?

979
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,042
No!

980
00:44:39,044 --> 00:44:39,909
Come on, baby, tell me.

981
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:42,078
Honey, I'm not gonna be
angry with you.

982
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,680
I'm not gonna put you
on punishment.

983
00:44:43,682 --> 00:44:44,914
I just want to know
the truth.

984
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:47,517
Have you done something
to your father?

985
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:48,484
You're serious.

986
00:44:48,486 --> 00:44:50,920
I'm not gonna stand here
and listen to this.

987
00:44:50,922 --> 00:44:54,323
Why don't you ask
the man on the roof?

988
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:56,392
What man?

989
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:57,627
The man on your roof

990
00:44:57,629 --> 00:45:00,129
that's screamin'
and wavin' his hands.

991
00:45:00,131 --> 00:45:02,465
Maybe he's
seen your husband.

992
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:18,247
That's one.

993
00:45:25,724 --> 00:45:27,590
I'm just taking
a educated guess,

994
00:45:27,592 --> 00:45:31,394
but you're being paid
by the hour, are you?

995
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:32,495
You got it.

996
00:45:37,635 --> 00:45:38,367
Hello?

997
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:40,236
Hi, arlo.
This is crystal.

998
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:40,703
Hi, crystal.

999
00:45:40,705 --> 00:45:44,107
I hate to shock you,
but Casey's getting married.

1000
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:45,408
It--what?!

1001
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,276
We're at the Sullivan
wedding chapel.

1002
00:45:47,278 --> 00:45:48,244
Casey?!

1003
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,145
Yes, arlo!

1004
00:45:49,147 --> 00:45:50,179
Are you serious?!

1005
00:45:50,181 --> 00:45:51,013
I'm afraid so.

1006
00:45:51,015 --> 00:45:53,716
Listen, I appreciate
you calling.

1007
00:45:53,718 --> 00:45:56,052
We'll be right there!

1008
00:45:56,054 --> 00:45:57,019
Ok?

1009
00:45:57,021 --> 00:45:57,987
Ok. Please hurry.

1010
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:01,491
Monica! Our daughter's
getting married.

1011
00:46:01,493 --> 00:46:02,725
You want to come?

1012
00:46:02,727 --> 00:46:04,293
Crystal: Now,
hold still, dear.

1013
00:46:04,295 --> 00:46:08,364
Arlo: Casey,
what is going on?

1014
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:09,999
I'm getting married,

1015
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:12,635
as soon as the justice
of the peace gets here.

1016
00:46:12,637 --> 00:46:13,636
You can stay
if you want.

1017
00:46:13,638 --> 00:46:15,171
Honey, now listen
to me, ok, case?

1018
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:17,140
Now, I know that if
Kevin really loves you,

1019
00:46:17,142 --> 00:46:18,441
he'll wait until
you're old enough--

1020
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:19,642
mom, I'm not marrying Kevin.

1021
00:46:19,644 --> 00:46:22,512
I asked him,
but he said no.

1022
00:46:23,715 --> 00:46:26,115
I'm marrying him.

1023
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:31,988
His name is Rudy something,
and I love him very much.

1024
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,990
Your daughter's
about to become

1025
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:35,324
a very wealthy
young woman.

1026
00:46:35,326 --> 00:46:37,326
Arnie: Casey called
us and asked us

1027
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:38,528
to act as witnesses.

1028
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:39,762
She said you knew
about it.

1029
00:46:39,764 --> 00:46:40,997
I didn't think
it was right,

1030
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:42,598
so I thought
I should call.

1031
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,367
I don't think
I have to tell you

1032
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:47,570
how very special
Casey is.

1033
00:46:48,773 --> 00:46:51,374
Casey, where'd
you find this man?

1034
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:53,476
Is there a asshole
convention in town?

1035
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:56,212
No. I met him at the mall
this afternoon.

1036
00:46:56,214 --> 00:46:58,414
But I feel like I've
known her all my life.

1037
00:46:58,416 --> 00:47:01,517
I'll supervise
her career myself,

1038
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:05,721
see that she's
photographed...Properly,

1039
00:47:05,723 --> 00:47:08,057
sensuously...

1040
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:09,659
Tastefully.

1041
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:13,262
Monica: Casey, honey,
you can't be serious.

1042
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:15,131
Oh, yeah?

1043
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:17,200
Sure, we'll have
our problems,

1044
00:47:17,202 --> 00:47:18,734
like most young couples.

1045
00:47:18,736 --> 00:47:20,736
You're gonna have
a problem walking straight

1046
00:47:20,738 --> 00:47:23,639
if you don't take your hands
off my daughter.

1047
00:47:23,641 --> 00:47:27,143
Dad, you wouldn't
listen to me.

1048
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:28,711
I cannot leave now.

1049
00:47:28,713 --> 00:47:31,180
It's my last year
of school.

1050
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:36,118
Casey, we didn't know
how serious you were.

1051
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:36,686
Excuse me, Monica,

1052
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:39,322
we have an extra room
in the house.

1053
00:47:39,324 --> 00:47:42,291
We were planning
on renting it out.

1054
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:43,559
It's not very big.

1055
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:44,293
That's all right.

1056
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:48,397
Crystal: We already
think of you as family.

1057
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:52,668
Please,
just till I graduate?

1058
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:56,138
Sure.

1059
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,381
We're going.

1060
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:09,685
Arlo: Here. Marry these!

1061
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:15,791
Monica: Second thoughts?

1062
00:48:15,793 --> 00:48:17,226
Hmm?

1063
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:21,197
I couldn't sleep, either.

1064
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:23,699
I was just thinking,

1065
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:28,604
wondering if the kids
will remember this house.

1066
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,706
I think so.

1067
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:34,176
A lot of happy memories.

1068
00:48:35,914 --> 00:48:38,881
Do you remember Marshall
took his first steps

1069
00:48:38,883 --> 00:48:40,683
right over there?

1070
00:48:40,685 --> 00:48:41,751
Yeah.

1071
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:45,554
And Randy didn't walk
until 6 months later.

1072
00:48:46,224 --> 00:48:49,325
Now look which one's
the track star.

1073
00:48:57,135 --> 00:49:01,871
Oh, arlo, I hope we're
doing the right thing.

1074
00:49:01,873 --> 00:49:05,474
It doesn't really matter
where we live

1075
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:07,877
as long as we're together.

1076
00:49:07,879 --> 00:49:10,179
We hired
the right movers.

1077
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:10,913
Don't worry, honey.

1078
00:49:10,915 --> 00:49:13,616
Everything's gonna be ok.

1079
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,285
Mrs. pear?

1080
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,754
Yes, Mr. pear?

1081
00:49:18,756 --> 00:49:21,691
Would you have
one last dance with me

1082
00:49:21,693 --> 00:49:23,592
in New Jersey?

1083
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:26,495
Yes.

1084
00:49:26,497 --> 00:49:28,364
Yes.

1085
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:53,883
Arlo: No!

1086
00:50:53,885 --> 00:50:55,418
Hey, Mr. p,
sorry we're late.

1087
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,486
Late?! You're not
supposed to be here!

1088
00:50:57,488 --> 00:50:58,654
Hide your underwear,
dear!

1089
00:50:58,656 --> 00:50:59,588
Yeah,
I know, I know.

1090
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,257
You're expecting
another mover, huh?

1091
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:01,891
Hummingbird movers?

1092
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:04,593
We work for them now,
as of yesterday.

1093
00:51:04,595 --> 00:51:05,494
It's fate.

1094
00:51:05,496 --> 00:51:06,395
Fuckin' kismet.

1095
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:07,029
Fuckin' kismet? Fate?

1096
00:51:07,031 --> 00:51:08,731
I don't give a damn
about that.

1097
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:10,299
I don't want
you gentlemen

1098
00:51:10,301 --> 00:51:11,500
in my house,

1099
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:13,936
touching anything that
belongs to my family,

1100
00:51:13,938 --> 00:51:14,503
damn it!

1101
00:51:14,505 --> 00:51:19,442
Gorgo, this man don't
want to pay us for the day.

1102
00:51:19,444 --> 00:51:20,342
Gorgo-schworgo!

1103
00:51:20,344 --> 00:51:21,777
I don't want you
in my--

1104
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:25,347
Hey. Hey, you--
look.

1105
00:51:27,819 --> 00:51:30,386
Aah!

1106
00:51:30,388 --> 00:51:31,921
Gorgo! You're gorgo?

1107
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:35,491
You're gorgo--you can move
anything you like.

1108
00:51:35,493 --> 00:51:37,393
I was just kidding
with the--

1109
00:51:37,395 --> 00:51:38,394
move my car if you'd like.

1110
00:51:38,396 --> 00:51:41,931
Just pick it up
and put it on the lawn, ok?

1111
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:55,644
Darling?
They're here!

1112
00:51:58,483 --> 00:52:02,017
Hey! What are you doing,
dragging that around?

1113
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:02,818
I have a key inside

1114
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,487
that you can unlock
that with, ok?

1115
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:07,089
That won't be
necessary, Mr. pear.

1116
00:52:08,326 --> 00:52:10,893
Jesus!
What are you doing?!

1117
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:33,616
Hey, hey, nothin'
like a nice, cold drink.

1118
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:48,364
Honey, I found
this container

1119
00:52:48,366 --> 00:52:49,932
for our sandwiches
and things,

1120
00:52:49,934 --> 00:52:51,534
and I'll put it in--

1121
00:52:51,536 --> 00:52:53,002
you guys
enjoying yourself?

1122
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:54,069
Yeah,
this is great.

1123
00:52:54,071 --> 00:52:54,870
Perry:
I love it.

1124
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:58,240
So where you folks
movin' to?

1125
00:53:00,912 --> 00:53:02,611
Boise, Idaho.
Remember?

1126
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:05,814
Sure you don't want
to move to new Orleans?

1127
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:07,750
I beg pardon?

1128
00:53:07,752 --> 00:53:08,450
New Orleans.

1129
00:53:08,452 --> 00:53:10,052
You know,
new Orleans, Louisiana?

1130
00:53:10,054 --> 00:53:11,120
It's mardi gras time.

1131
00:53:11,122 --> 00:53:14,557
Maybe you'd rather
move there.

1132
00:53:15,593 --> 00:53:18,260
We bought a home
in Boise, Idaho,

1133
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:21,697
and we're moving
to Boise, Idaho.

1134
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:24,767
Suit yourself.

1135
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:26,435
Heh heh heh heh!

1136
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:28,437
Oh, shoot.

1137
00:53:29,774 --> 00:53:31,674
Hey, man, the leg
just jumped off.

1138
00:53:31,676 --> 00:53:33,943
Bullshit! This leg
didn't jump off.

1139
00:53:33,945 --> 00:53:35,911
This is--oh, my God!

1140
00:53:35,913 --> 00:53:38,147
My grandfather made
this table

1141
00:53:38,149 --> 00:53:39,949
with his own hands!

1142
00:53:39,951 --> 00:53:42,952
It's irreplaceable!

1143
00:53:48,526 --> 00:53:49,792
I'm sorry I'm late, sir.

1144
00:53:49,794 --> 00:53:50,659
You're not late.

1145
00:53:50,661 --> 00:53:53,829
Mr. pear,
I'm 30 seconds late.

1146
00:53:56,434 --> 00:53:56,966
Here's the key.

1147
00:53:56,968 --> 00:54:00,736
I want you to park it
sideways when you park it,

1148
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:03,505
'cause I don't want
any scratches on her.

1149
00:54:03,507 --> 00:54:04,573
Yes, sir.
I understand.

1150
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,642
Don't worry
about a thing, sir.

1151
00:54:06,644 --> 00:54:07,810
I'm not worried.

1152
00:54:07,812 --> 00:54:09,511
Take good care
of my baby, now.

1153
00:54:09,513 --> 00:54:11,347
Yes, sir, I will.

1154
00:54:12,149 --> 00:54:14,049
55, stay alive.

1155
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:15,050
Well, take care.

1156
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,753
Good-bye, Mr. pear.

1157
00:54:27,732 --> 00:54:28,964
Hi, Frank.

1158
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:32,234
I know this may be
an oversight on your part,

1159
00:54:32,236 --> 00:54:33,068
but...

1160
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:33,969
But a couple of years ago,

1161
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:36,005
you borrowed
my weed whacker, remember?

1162
00:54:36,007 --> 00:54:38,140
Well, we're moving,
as you can see,

1163
00:54:38,142 --> 00:54:40,943
and, uh, I'd like to get
that weed whacker back

1164
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:43,946
and take it with us,
so can I have it?

1165
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:45,681
Mmm...

1166
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:49,051
No.

1167
00:54:49,053 --> 00:54:51,220
It's our weed whacker,
Frank.

1168
00:54:51,222 --> 00:54:52,588
I mean,
the whole family

1169
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,857
went down to sears
together.

1170
00:54:55,826 --> 00:54:57,559
We went to sears.

1171
00:54:59,096 --> 00:55:02,097
And, uh, it was on sale
for $18.

1172
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:06,135
The whole family likes it,
so I come over to ask you

1173
00:55:06,137 --> 00:55:07,936
to give it back to me.

1174
00:55:07,938 --> 00:55:09,271
No.

1175
00:55:09,273 --> 00:55:11,940
Frank, I knew you was gonna
do something like this.

1176
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:14,610
I loaned you
the weed whacker 2 years ago

1177
00:55:14,612 --> 00:55:15,177
to cut your grass.

1178
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:17,780
You haven't cut shit
with the weed whacker.

1179
00:55:17,782 --> 00:55:19,048
What did you
do with it?

1180
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,749
Keep the weed whacker,
Frank. Ok?

1181
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:22,785
That's the kind of guy
I am! Ok?

1182
00:55:22,787 --> 00:55:23,786
You love
the weed whacker?

1183
00:55:23,788 --> 00:55:25,120
Be happy
with the weed whacker,

1184
00:55:25,122 --> 00:55:27,089
'cause you have
no friends, Frank.

1185
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:28,657
Nobody wants
to talk to you.

1186
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,659
Edwards: Frank!
I don't believe it!

1187
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:33,062
Perry: Hey, Frank!
Frank Crawford!

1188
00:55:33,064 --> 00:55:33,929
How the hell are you?

1189
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:37,966
Edwards! Perry!
Well, choke my chicken!

1190
00:55:37,968 --> 00:55:40,302
When did you guys
get out?!

1191
00:55:40,304 --> 00:55:41,737
A few months ago, man!

1192
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:46,942
Hey, man,
is this your base?

1193
00:55:46,944 --> 00:55:47,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1194
00:55:47,712 --> 00:55:48,944
Man, this is great!
I love it!

1195
00:55:48,946 --> 00:55:50,112
Come on in
and have a brew.

1196
00:55:50,114 --> 00:55:51,146
We're gonna take
a break.

1197
00:55:55,886 --> 00:55:57,019
Frank: Come on in!

1198
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:58,721
Edwards:
Whoa! Yeah, man!

1199
00:56:09,767 --> 00:56:11,266
I'm gonna miss you,
baby.

1200
00:56:11,268 --> 00:56:13,068
Ohh!

1201
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:15,003
Crystal, I want you
to take this, ok?

1202
00:56:15,005 --> 00:56:17,339
I won't hear of it.
Now come on.

1203
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:18,807
Give me a hug.

1204
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:20,008
Crystal.

1205
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,114
Arlo, we're really
gonna miss you.

1206
00:56:25,116 --> 00:56:26,048
Gonna miss you, too,
man.

1207
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,816
Want you to take care
of my little girl, now.

1208
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:28,217
We will.

1209
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:32,921
You know, you're
a handful, little girl.

1210
00:56:32,923 --> 00:56:34,857
I know, but you love me.

1211
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:37,025
Yes, I do.

1212
00:56:38,796 --> 00:56:41,363
Randy, Marshall,
check the dog.

1213
00:56:41,365 --> 00:56:43,031
Ok.
Ok.

1214
00:56:47,138 --> 00:56:48,837
She's alive, dad.

1215
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:51,740
Then we're taking her
with us.

1216
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:08,123
Monica: Bye.

1217
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:09,191
Bye, sweetie.
You be good.

1218
00:57:09,193 --> 00:57:11,693
Randy:
Take it easy, case!

1219
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:12,828
Casey: Be good.

1220
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:13,295
We won't.

1221
00:57:13,297 --> 00:57:15,564
Marshall:
We'll miss you!

1222
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,771
Everybody say good-bye
to Frank.

1223
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:23,872
Good-bye, Frank

1224
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:24,840
good-bye, Frank!

1225
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:26,775
Marshall and Randy:
Good-bye, Frank!

1226
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:27,676
Arlo: Bye, Frank!

1227
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:29,711
Swing on this,
Frank!

1228
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,750
Boom! Boom! Boom!

1229
00:57:34,752 --> 00:57:36,819
Ah ha ha ha ha!

1230
00:57:43,694 --> 00:57:45,260
Dad, I have to use
the rest room.

1231
00:57:45,262 --> 00:57:46,228
And I'm hungry.

1232
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,464
There's a restaurant
over there.

1233
00:57:56,173 --> 00:57:59,007
You like that? Good.

1234
00:58:00,744 --> 00:58:02,411
Uh, that corner table, ok?

1235
00:58:02,413 --> 00:58:03,412
And your mouth is shut.

1236
00:58:03,414 --> 00:58:06,148
Your mother and I
will order food.

1237
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,316
May I help you?

1238
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:09,318
Uh, yes,
2 cheeseburgers,

1239
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,920
order of fires,

1240
00:58:11,922 --> 00:58:13,755
and 2 milks,

1241
00:58:13,757 --> 00:58:15,090
and one
plain burger.

1242
00:58:15,092 --> 00:58:19,761
Dad, it's this famous guy
driving our car.

1243
00:58:19,763 --> 00:58:20,829
That's right.

1244
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,731
No, the saab.

1245
00:58:25,302 --> 00:58:29,438
Monica: "The amazing 8
personalities of Brad Williams.

1246
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,340

"Williams'
schizophrenic tendencies

1252
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:54,396
oh, they never
put a vanity mirror

1253
00:58:54,398 --> 00:58:56,999
where a girl can use one.

1254
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:02,738
Damn nostril hair.

1255
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,844
Giddy-up, Mr. car.

1256
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:18,053
Hey, stud,
you wanna ride me?

1257
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,790
Do you like my car?

1258
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:24,826
It's got
a real big engine.

1259
00:59:24,828 --> 00:59:26,795
Do you?

1260
00:59:28,999 --> 00:59:32,868
Have it your way,
Mr. perfect.

1261
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:44,913
I hope
she's a good driver.

1262
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:47,015
You're listening to Boise's

number one
rock 'n' roll station: J-105.

I'm Carl--

1265
00:59:53,023 --> 00:59:55,190
Well, it's almost 3:30,

1266
00:59:55,192 --> 00:59:58,093
and the movers
should be there by now.

1267
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,495
Boys, we're almost there.

1268
01:00:00,497 --> 01:00:02,898
Arlo: I got the key,

1269
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,600
and I want everybody--

1270
01:00:04,602 --> 01:00:05,901
close your eyes!

1271
01:00:05,903 --> 01:00:08,203
Come on, kids.
Close your eyes.

1272
01:00:08,205 --> 01:00:09,171
This is gonna be--
you, too!

1273
01:00:09,173 --> 01:00:11,006
This is
gonna be a surprise.

1274
01:00:11,008 --> 01:00:12,975
All right,
close your eyes!

1275
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:14,843
We're--

1276
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:22,050
can we open
our eyes now?

1277
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:25,754
No.

1278
01:00:34,531 --> 01:00:36,765
Where are the doors?

1279
01:00:48,379 --> 01:00:50,912
Oh! Ooh!

1280
01:00:50,914 --> 01:00:52,214
Ooooh!

1281
01:00:52,216 --> 01:00:54,316
Ooooh!

1282
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:12,000
Aaaaah!

1283
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:13,301
Kitchen!

1284
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:14,269
The kitc--

1285
01:01:14,271 --> 01:01:15,303
the kitchen!

1286
01:01:15,305 --> 01:01:17,205
Where's the kitchen?

1287
01:01:17,207 --> 01:01:20,442
They took
the goddamn kitchen!

1288
01:01:20,444 --> 01:01:22,544
There's no kitchen!

1289
01:01:37,895 --> 01:01:38,460
Hello?!

1290
01:01:38,462 --> 01:01:40,295
Hey, how's it hangin', man?

1291
01:01:40,297 --> 01:01:41,463
Arlo: How's it hangin'?

1292
01:01:41,465 --> 01:01:42,364
Where are you guys?

1293
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:44,299
You're supposed
to be here now!

1294
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:46,101
Uh, well, we got lost.

1295
01:01:46,103 --> 01:01:48,303
I think I took
a wrong turn somewhere.

1296
01:01:48,305 --> 01:01:49,671
Uh, do you think,
by chance,

1297
01:01:49,673 --> 01:01:51,707
you may have
made a wrong turn

1298
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:52,574
to new Orleans?!

1299
01:01:52,576 --> 01:01:54,109
Yep,
we're in new Orleans,

1300
01:01:54,111 --> 01:01:56,044
and, uh,
it's mardi gras time.

1301
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:56,745
Mardi gras time, huh?

1302
01:01:56,747 --> 01:01:59,414
Listen, asshole,
I want my furniture here

1303
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:00,482
in Boise, Idaho,

1304
01:02:00,484 --> 01:02:01,249
and I want it now!

1305
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:05,554
Hey, all right, all right,
we're on our way, pal.

1306
01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:06,521
Hello?

1307
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:07,556
Helloooo!

1308
01:02:13,497 --> 01:02:17,199
Randy: I thought
you said we had a pool!

1309
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:20,001
Aaaaaah!

1310
01:02:20,003 --> 01:02:23,071
Cadell, when I bought
this house from you

1311
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,606
it had doors...

1312
01:02:24,608 --> 01:02:28,143
Stairs,
and a swimming pool!

1313
01:02:28,145 --> 01:02:29,377
Now where's the shit now?

1314
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:31,213
Now, hold on, pear.
I distinctly told you

1315
01:02:31,215 --> 01:02:33,749
I was taking the pool
and the doors with us.

1316
01:02:33,751 --> 01:02:34,683
You said you were joking.

1317
01:02:34,685 --> 01:02:36,685
You were
just kidding about that.

1318
01:02:36,687 --> 01:02:37,719
No, sir. No, sir.

1319
01:02:37,721 --> 01:02:38,987
I recorded
the entire conversation.

1320
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:40,455
I got
the transcript right here.

1321
01:02:40,457 --> 01:02:41,289
I said just kidding

1322
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:42,591
about the windows
and the kitchen sink,

1323
01:02:42,593 --> 01:02:43,425
so I never actually said

1324
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:45,494
just kidding
about the doors and the pool.

1325
01:02:45,496 --> 01:02:46,495
Now, listen, cadell!

1326
01:02:46,497 --> 01:02:48,130
You're a bullshitter, ok?!

1327
01:02:48,132 --> 01:02:49,598
Now, if you don't have
workmen here in 2 days

1328
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,199
putting my stuff
back in order,

1329
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:53,301
I'm gonna
kick your ass!

1330
01:02:56,306 --> 01:02:58,273
Man on TV: Well,
Mr. Maverick's in.

1331
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:01,176
How 'bout you,
Mr. Maverick?

1332
01:03:03,714 --> 01:03:06,214
Gentleman friend
still not home?

1333
01:03:06,216 --> 01:03:09,050
No, and I don't
understand it.

1334
01:03:09,052 --> 01:03:10,418
He told me to call him.

1335
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:12,988
I'm sure
he'll be back soon.

1336
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:13,622
Meanwhile,

1337
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:16,291
come here and watch
Maverick with us.

1338
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:17,058
Sit here.

1339
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:21,463
Maverick: I'll see it
and raise you $200.

1340
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:22,597
Man on TV:
That ain't money.

1341
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:24,032
Oh, it's the same thing.

1342
01:03:24,034 --> 01:03:26,635
Here's my draft
for $10,000.

1343
01:03:26,637 --> 01:03:27,435
Still ain't money.

1344
01:03:27,437 --> 01:03:28,537
We're not playin'
table stakes.

1345
01:03:28,539 --> 01:03:32,440
Ya see,
that's James garner.

1346
01:03:32,442 --> 01:03:36,178
He plays
Bret Maverick.

1347
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:39,714
And that's
his brother Bart Maverick.

1348
01:03:39,716 --> 01:03:43,752
They're gamblers
on the Mississippi.

1349
01:03:45,823 --> 01:03:48,390
I don't know
who he is.

1350
01:03:48,392 --> 01:03:51,760
I think
he's a desperado.

1351
01:03:58,535 --> 01:03:59,801
Arlo: Honey?

1352
01:03:59,803 --> 01:04:00,635
Monica: Hmm?

1353
01:04:00,637 --> 01:04:02,671
You awake?
Mm-hmm.

1354
01:04:02,673 --> 01:04:04,239
Well...

1355
01:04:04,241 --> 01:04:07,209
The boys register
for school today.

1356
01:04:07,211 --> 01:04:08,109
Mm-hmm.

1357
01:04:08,111 --> 01:04:08,610
By noon today,

1358
01:04:08,612 --> 01:04:11,613
the movers should be
here with our stuff.

1359
01:04:11,615 --> 01:04:12,447
Mm-hmm.

1360
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:15,083
I'm gonna get
the furnace fixed.

1361
01:04:15,085 --> 01:04:16,751
Mm-hmm.

1362
01:04:16,753 --> 01:04:17,519
And by tonight,

1363
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:20,589
everything should
be back to normal.

1364
01:04:38,442 --> 01:04:41,309
God, no.

1365
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:54,489
Your name wouldn't
be Crawford, would it?

1366
01:04:54,491 --> 01:04:56,258
Yeah, that's right.

1367
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:57,592
Cornell Crawford.

1368
01:04:57,594 --> 01:04:58,727
What's it to ya?

1369
01:04:58,729 --> 01:05:01,463
Do you have a brother?

1370
01:05:01,465 --> 01:05:05,533
Well, choke my chicken.

1371
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:08,303
Your name's pear, right?

1372
01:05:08,305 --> 01:05:10,605
You lived right
next-door to Frank.

1373
01:05:10,607 --> 01:05:12,207
Am I right?

1374
01:05:12,209 --> 01:05:13,208
Yeah.

1375
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:17,779
It's a small world,
isn't it?

1376
01:05:17,781 --> 01:05:19,281
Too small.

1377
01:05:19,283 --> 01:05:22,550
Yeah, Frank says
you're a real asshole,

1378
01:05:22,552 --> 01:05:24,819
and if you fuck with me,
I'll kill ya.

1379
01:05:24,821 --> 01:05:26,187
Ya understand?

1380
01:05:26,189 --> 01:05:28,156
Oh, yeah, I--

1381
01:05:28,158 --> 01:05:28,790
good.

1382
01:05:36,934 --> 01:05:40,602
Uh, Randy
and Marshall pear?

1383
01:05:44,675 --> 01:05:47,409
Oh, I thought
there'd be 2 of you.

1384
01:05:47,411 --> 01:05:47,809
2 of me?

1385
01:05:47,811 --> 01:05:50,545
Yes, don't you have
a brother named Marshall?

1386
01:05:50,547 --> 01:05:53,315
No, ma'am.
Marshall's my middle name.

1387
01:05:53,317 --> 01:05:54,783
Oh, I see.

1388
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:55,750
You know,
these computers

1389
01:05:55,752 --> 01:05:58,286
are gonna
be the death of us all.

1390
01:05:58,288 --> 01:05:58,753
Yes, ma'am.

1391
01:05:58,755 --> 01:06:00,588
They made the same mistake
at my other school.

1392
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:01,489
Mm-mm-mm.

1393
01:06:01,491 --> 01:06:02,891
Well, Randy Marshall,

1394
01:06:02,893 --> 01:06:05,660
I guess you'll only
be needing one of these,

1395
01:06:05,662 --> 01:06:07,662
and your
locker number's 54,

1396
01:06:07,664 --> 01:06:10,298
and that's straight
down this hall

1397
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,234
and to your right.

1398
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:25,246
Marshall, is that you?

1399
01:06:28,185 --> 01:06:28,950
How'd it go?

1400
01:06:28,952 --> 01:06:30,285
I pulled it off.

1401
01:06:30,287 --> 01:06:31,853
Ahh, great.

1402
01:06:32,756 --> 01:06:34,356
Do you think
they'll catch on?

1403
01:06:34,358 --> 01:06:36,725
No one has yet.

1404
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:47,569
I never thought
I'd say this, but...

1405
01:06:47,571 --> 01:06:48,370
I'm getting tired

1406
01:06:48,372 --> 01:06:50,005
of cheeseburgers
and fries.

1407
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:01,383
Is it the movers?

1408
01:07:01,385 --> 01:07:03,885
Arlo: The movers! Hooray!

1409
01:07:03,887 --> 01:07:06,254
It's the movers.

1410
01:07:11,962 --> 01:07:14,396
Sons of bitches!

1411
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:19,634
Wait! Don't--no!

1412
01:07:19,636 --> 01:07:20,969
Please, back up.

1413
01:07:20,971 --> 01:07:22,470
Hello!

1414
01:07:22,472 --> 01:07:24,672
Mr. and Mrs. pear.

1415
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:27,742
We're from the welcome
wagon committee.

1416
01:07:27,744 --> 01:07:29,644
I'm Zelda messina.

1417
01:07:29,646 --> 01:07:30,945
Woman: Hi!

1418
01:07:30,947 --> 01:07:33,415
I'm
Elizabeth Griffin.

1419
01:07:33,417 --> 01:07:35,283
Welcome to Boise.
Hello.

1420
01:07:35,285 --> 01:07:37,786
Oh, these
are some brochures.

1421
01:07:37,788 --> 01:07:38,720
It's a free gift

1422
01:07:38,722 --> 01:07:40,388
from our
local merchants,

1423
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:40,855
Mrs. pear.

1424
01:07:40,857 --> 01:07:42,524
Now, we can only come in
for just a minute.

1425
01:07:42,526 --> 01:07:45,293
Oh, uh, well,
we're not really fixed up yet.

1426
01:07:45,295 --> 01:07:47,729
Oh, I'm sure
it's just lovely.

1427
01:07:47,731 --> 01:07:48,630
Oh, no,
well, see--

1428
01:07:48,632 --> 01:07:51,866
could you move the car?
Ladies? Uh, um--

1429
01:07:51,868 --> 01:07:54,903
ah, I'll go around.

1430
01:08:08,385 --> 01:08:10,018
Brad: Oh, man, that is--

1431
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:11,853
that is a great car, man.

1432
01:08:11,855 --> 01:08:14,055
Fuck, it handles
great, man.

1433
01:08:14,057 --> 01:08:15,490
Left, right.
It's great.

1434
01:08:15,492 --> 01:08:17,926
Brakes stop
on a fuckin' dime.

1435
01:08:17,928 --> 01:08:18,660
Jesus Christ,

1436
01:08:18,662 --> 01:08:20,695
you got power
in this thing, man.

1437
01:08:20,697 --> 01:08:21,996
The thing'll
take a hairpin turn

1438
01:08:21,998 --> 01:08:24,933
at 120,
no fuckin' problem.

1439
01:08:24,935 --> 01:08:25,867
You floor it,

1440
01:08:25,869 --> 01:08:26,734
it just says gimme more.

1441
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:28,570
The car says
gimme more, man.

1442
01:08:28,572 --> 01:08:29,904
Keys, dude?

1443
01:08:29,906 --> 01:08:31,506
A cop tried
to pull me over.

1444
01:08:31,508 --> 01:08:32,407
I said
eat this, man.

1445
01:08:32,409 --> 01:08:33,975
I put it in fifth.
Forget about it.

1446
01:08:33,977 --> 01:08:34,742
The only thing was

1447
01:08:34,744 --> 01:08:35,977
I couldn't
get it in reverse,

1448
01:08:35,979 --> 01:08:37,011
but then
I was pissed,

1449
01:08:37,013 --> 01:08:37,946
and then
I said fuck,

1450
01:08:37,948 --> 01:08:38,880
I don't
need reverse.

1451
01:08:38,882 --> 01:08:39,981
What do I need
reverse for?

1452
01:08:39,983 --> 01:08:41,850
I don't wanna go
back in life, man.

1453
01:08:41,852 --> 01:08:42,917
I wanna go forward.

1454
01:08:42,919 --> 01:08:44,686
So the cop tries
to pull me over,

1455
01:08:44,688 --> 01:08:46,621
I say fuck it.
Ha ha.

1456
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:48,323
Where...Is my car?

1457
01:08:48,325 --> 01:08:50,158
Oh, I was supposed
to deliver this car

1458
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,594
to, uh,

1459
01:08:52,596 --> 01:08:53,828
To a guy named arlo.

1460
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:55,663
Is that you?

1461
01:08:55,665 --> 01:08:56,931
Is your name arlo, man?

1462
01:08:56,933 --> 01:08:59,834
That's a fuckin'
funny name. Arlo. Ha ha.

1463
01:08:59,836 --> 01:09:03,872
Oh, man, you must laugh
all the time, huh?

1464
01:09:03,874 --> 01:09:05,773
You come here
through a war zone?

1465
01:09:05,775 --> 01:09:07,475
Soda Springs, man.
Back off, dude.

1466
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:09,077
I'm just delivering
this car as a favor

1467
01:09:09,079 --> 01:09:10,645
for a friend
of mine, man.

1468
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:12,046
Brad Williams.
Do you know him?

1469
01:09:12,048 --> 01:09:13,681
He's really
fuckin' straight.

1470
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:16,784
I mean,
he's about my heighth.

1471
01:09:16,786 --> 01:09:18,453
Could I...

1472
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:22,390
Speak to Brad...Please?

1473
01:09:29,566 --> 01:09:31,566
No, man,
you can't talk to Brad.

1474
01:09:31,568 --> 01:09:32,934
I can't talk to Brad.

1475
01:09:32,936 --> 01:09:35,570
No one knows
who Brad is, man.

1476
01:09:35,572 --> 01:09:37,472
I love him.

1477
01:09:37,474 --> 01:09:38,773
He's beautiful!

1478
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:41,109
I can't
get close to him.

1479
01:09:41,111 --> 01:09:42,544
Shit, man,
Nixon knew, man.

1480
01:09:42,546 --> 01:09:44,779
I don't even know
my political affil--

1481
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:46,481
huh?

1482
01:09:46,483 --> 01:09:46,981
Huh?

1483
01:09:46,983 --> 01:09:49,851
Teddy?
Ted--Teddy?

1484
01:09:51,021 --> 01:09:52,820
Teddy.

1485
01:09:52,822 --> 01:09:54,489
What...

1486
01:09:54,491 --> 01:09:55,690
Happened to my car?

1487
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:58,459
Brad probably loaned
the car to the pope.

1488
01:09:58,461 --> 01:09:59,093
Don't let--

1489
01:09:59,095 --> 01:10:00,428
don't let
the hat fool ya, man.

1490
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:01,996
The pope's
a crazy fucker.

1491
01:10:01,998 --> 01:10:03,131
He probably
blessed the car,

1492
01:10:03,133 --> 01:10:04,899
got wasted,
and just drove it

1493
01:10:04,901 --> 01:10:05,700
off a fuckin' cliff.

1494
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:07,402
Monica: Uh,
come back next week...

1495
01:10:07,404 --> 01:10:08,570
Who are the chicks?

1496
01:10:08,572 --> 01:10:11,539
Well, we hardly ever
get into this neighborhood.

1497
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:13,007
Hardly ever. Really.

1498
01:10:13,009 --> 01:10:14,876
Afternoon, ladies!

1499
01:10:15,812 --> 01:10:17,946
Oh...Zelda?

1500
01:10:21,418 --> 01:10:23,518
I'm gonna kill you.

1501
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,153
Do you hear me?

1502
01:10:25,155 --> 01:10:25,887
Mm-hmm.

1503
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:29,023
So you got about
an hour to get outta town

1504
01:10:29,025 --> 01:10:30,858
before I find a gun

1505
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,293
and I load it
with 8 bullets

1506
01:10:32,295 --> 01:10:35,697
and I kill all crazy 8
of you son of a bitches.

1507
01:10:35,699 --> 01:10:38,833
Now, please go.
I don't wanna go to jail.

1508
01:10:38,835 --> 01:10:40,602
Please.

1509
01:10:41,171 --> 01:10:42,937
You're squishin'
Teddy, man.

1510
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:46,774
I'm gonna kill him, too.

1511
01:11:11,701 --> 01:11:12,767
How was the move?

1512
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:13,835
Uneventful.

1513
01:11:13,837 --> 01:11:14,936
Terrific.

1514
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:16,771
Good morning,
Mr. pear.

1515
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:17,705
Good morning.

1516
01:11:17,707 --> 01:11:20,141
It is a pleasure
to meet you.

1517
01:11:20,143 --> 01:11:22,610
Bob Delaney,

1518
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:22,944

01:11:26,182 --> 01:11:28,249

1521
01:11:28,251 --> 01:11:30,118

1522
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,586
Hey, at last.

1523
01:11:31,588 --> 01:11:32,520
Welcome.

1524
01:11:32,522 --> 01:11:32,954
Thank you.

1525
01:11:32,956 --> 01:11:34,022
I want to show you
some drawings

1526
01:11:34,024 --> 01:11:35,757
as soon
as you're settled.

1527
01:11:35,759 --> 01:11:36,591
Ok.

1528
01:11:36,593 --> 01:11:37,492
Come on, arlo.

1529
01:11:37,494 --> 01:11:39,694
Let me show you
your office.

1530
01:11:39,696 --> 01:11:41,596
Isn't this
place great?

1531
01:11:41,598 --> 01:11:43,197
Everybody's
so nice here.

1532
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:44,032
Yeah.

1533
01:11:44,034 --> 01:11:45,833
Oh, arlo, this
is Nina Franklin.

1534
01:11:45,835 --> 01:11:47,235
She'll be your
receptionist.

1535
01:11:47,237 --> 01:11:49,904
Hi. Welcome
to g.T.I.

1536
01:11:49,906 --> 01:11:51,572
Would you
like some coffee?

1537
01:11:51,574 --> 01:11:54,042
Oh, no. I have an
organizational meeting,

1538
01:11:54,044 --> 01:11:56,110
and it may
keep me awake.

1539
01:11:57,747 --> 01:11:59,614
Come on, arlo.

1540
01:11:59,616 --> 01:12:01,649
Oh.

1541
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,123
Well...
Boy.

1542
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:10,992
Here we are,
home sweet home.

1543
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:12,260
Do you like?
I love it.

1544
01:12:12,262 --> 01:12:13,928
Ha ha.
Well, I'm sure

1545
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:15,129
you wanna
get settled in,

1546
01:12:15,131 --> 01:12:15,930
so I'm gonna run,

1547
01:12:15,932 --> 01:12:17,165
but if you
need anything,

1548
01:12:17,167 --> 01:12:17,999
anything at all,

1549
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:18,966
don't
hesitate to ask.

1550
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:19,934
As far as
I'm concerned,

1551
01:12:19,936 --> 01:12:21,202
you're
the king of Idaho!

1552
01:12:21,204 --> 01:12:23,671
Thank you very much.

1553
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:26,074
Damn.

1554
01:12:34,884 --> 01:12:37,118
Oh, they bought it.

1555
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,820
I got the job.

1556
01:12:38,822 --> 01:12:42,590
I'm the king of Idaho.

1557
01:12:43,059 --> 01:12:44,859
Shh shh. Yeah.

1558
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:45,893
Sharpen pencil.

1559
01:12:47,297 --> 01:12:49,197
Why not?

1560
01:12:50,734 --> 01:12:53,134
A little drumroll.

1561
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:56,804
Back beat, please.

1562
01:12:56,806 --> 01:13:00,808
Woman: Come on,
let's set up over here.

1563
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:02,844
Reporter: Sir,
would you care to comment

1564
01:13:02,846 --> 01:13:05,713
on the decision to scrap
the phase one shuttle project?

1565
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:08,883
You better talk
to Mr. barnett.

1566
01:13:10,653 --> 01:13:11,819
Mr. barnett,
would you care to comment

1567
01:13:11,821 --> 01:13:14,856
on the decision to scrap
the phase one shuttle project?

1568
01:13:14,858 --> 01:13:15,857
About what?

1569
01:13:15,859 --> 01:13:18,626
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1570
01:13:18,628 --> 01:13:21,129
Ask Mr. pear.

1571
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:24,899
Reporter: Thank you.

1572
01:13:31,241 --> 01:13:32,039
Reporter: Mr. pear,

1573
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:34,709
how do you explain
the $15-million cost overrun

1574
01:13:34,711 --> 01:13:36,611
on the phase one shuttle?

1575
01:13:36,613 --> 01:13:37,211
$15 million?

1576
01:13:37,213 --> 01:13:38,813
Where did
the $15 million go,

1577
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:39,881
Mr. pear?

1578
01:13:39,883 --> 01:13:40,415
I don't know.

1579
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:41,716
What do you think
of the decision

1580
01:13:41,718 --> 01:13:42,750
to scrap
the whole project?

1581
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:43,384
Scrap the whole project?

1582
01:13:43,386 --> 01:13:44,919
Have you thought about
legal representation?

1583
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:46,821
Now that your job
has been eliminated, sir,

1584
01:13:46,823 --> 01:13:48,189
what are
your personal plans?

1585
01:13:48,191 --> 01:13:51,893
I just
sharpened my pencil.

1586
01:13:51,895 --> 01:13:54,095
Newscaster on TV:
We'll have more on this story

1587
01:13:54,097 --> 01:13:57,131
on the 6:00 news. Chuck?

1588
01:13:57,133 --> 01:13:57,999
In another top story,

1589
01:13:58,001 --> 01:14:01,169
the g.T.I. Scandal
continues to unfold.

1590
01:14:01,171 --> 01:14:03,271
The shutdown
came as a shock

1591
01:14:03,273 --> 01:14:04,906
to local
area residents,

1592
01:14:04,908 --> 01:14:06,240
hundreds of whom
work for g.T.I.

1593
01:14:06,242 --> 01:14:08,209
And whose jobs
are in question.

1594
01:14:08,211 --> 01:14:10,344
Hey, they're
talkin' about me!

1595
01:14:10,346 --> 01:14:11,779
Chuck: The project
coordinator offered

1596
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:13,181
very little new information.

1597
01:14:13,183 --> 01:14:15,416
Reporter: Now that your job
has been eliminated, sir,

1598
01:14:15,418 --> 01:14:16,884
what are
your personal plans?

1599
01:14:16,886 --> 01:14:19,120
I just sharpened
my pencil!

1600
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:19,854
Pussy!

1601
01:14:19,856 --> 01:14:21,923
Here, found
some more for you.

1602
01:14:21,925 --> 01:14:22,723
Thanks.

1603
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:26,427
Stop.

1604
01:14:26,496 --> 01:14:28,863
...whose latest book
is entitled go for it.

1605
01:14:28,865 --> 01:14:33,801
Dr. ames, exactly
what do you mean by...

1606
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:34,268
Go for it?

1607
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:37,071
Well, Chuck, the book
is about change.

1608
01:14:37,073 --> 01:14:39,907
I think it's about time
that people realize

1609
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:41,809
a little bit of change

1610
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:43,177
is a good thing.

1611
01:14:43,179 --> 01:14:43,811
Ha!

1612
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:45,079
Dr. ames:
For example, Chuck,

1613
01:14:45,081 --> 01:14:48,883
moving to a new town,
starting a new job,

1614
01:14:48,885 --> 01:14:50,284
well, for most people,

1615
01:14:50,286 --> 01:14:54,088
this is a high-stress
situation...But,

1616
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:56,390
well, I think
we should embrace it.

1617
01:14:56,392 --> 01:14:58,960
I think it's
the spice of life.

1618
01:14:58,962 --> 01:14:59,460
After all,

1619
01:14:59,462 --> 01:15:02,430
what's the worst thing
that could happen?

1620
01:15:02,432 --> 01:15:03,030
Ha ha.

1621
01:15:03,032 --> 01:15:06,033
Dr. ames: Don't be afraid
to shake things up.

1622
01:15:06,035 --> 01:15:09,270
I gotta meet that lady.

1623
01:15:09,272 --> 01:15:13,841
I gotta ask that lady,
where's my furniture?

1624
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:17,078
Lady, where's my door?

1625
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,045
What is it
with you, fella?

1626
01:15:18,047 --> 01:15:20,114
You think life
is one big joke?

1627
01:15:20,116 --> 01:15:22,049
No, no, no,

1628
01:15:22,051 --> 01:15:25,152
life is not
a big joke.

1629
01:15:25,154 --> 01:15:26,120
It's a series

1630
01:15:26,122 --> 01:15:29,257
of 8,000 or 9,000
little jokes,

1631
01:15:29,259 --> 01:15:33,327
you know,
all lined up in a row.

1632
01:15:33,329 --> 01:15:34,395
There they are,

1633
01:15:34,397 --> 01:15:37,098
and they slap you down.

1634
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,199
Slap. Slap. Slap.

1635
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:41,903
And the only way
you can survive that

1636
01:15:41,905 --> 01:15:45,172
is keep your head down!

1637
01:15:45,174 --> 01:15:47,308
Make the mustard!

1638
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:50,278
Huh? Stay in New Jersey,

1639
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:55,116
and you make
the goddamn mustard!

1640
01:15:55,118 --> 01:15:58,920
After you're happy
where ya are,

1641
01:15:58,922 --> 01:16:01,055
don't move!

1642
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:02,056
Stay where ya are!

1643
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:05,026
Keep your head down,
and don't move,

1644
01:16:05,028 --> 01:16:07,328
and you won't get hurt!

1645
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,933
Hank, what'd
you do that for?

1646
01:16:11,935 --> 01:16:13,167
I thought he was
holdin' the place up.

1647
01:16:13,169 --> 01:16:15,536
Bartender: Nah, the guy
was just spouting off.

1648
01:16:15,538 --> 01:16:16,470
Help him up.

1649
01:16:17,974 --> 01:16:19,807
I'm awful sorry.

1650
01:16:19,809 --> 01:16:20,775
That's ok.

1651
01:16:20,777 --> 01:16:23,010
High point of my day.

1652
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:26,847
Come on! Come on,
put some movement in it!

1653
01:16:26,849 --> 01:16:29,183
Listen, you wanna
get your little old ass--

1654
01:16:29,185 --> 01:16:30,952
excuse me...

1655
01:16:30,954 --> 01:16:33,421
People to kill.

1656
01:17:27,443 --> 01:17:28,042
Yo, man.

1657
01:17:28,044 --> 01:17:30,111
There's some crazy mother
in a saab following us.

1658
01:17:30,113 --> 01:17:31,512
Who is it, man?

1659
01:17:35,485 --> 01:17:37,051
I want my furniture!

1660
01:17:37,053 --> 01:17:38,519
Oh, shit.
It's arlo pear.

1661
01:17:38,521 --> 01:17:41,122
Oh, man.
Forget about him.

1662
01:17:52,635 --> 01:17:55,302
Hey, man! Watch the road!
Look out!

1663
01:18:00,309 --> 01:18:02,076
Ha ha ha!

1664
01:18:14,624 --> 01:18:17,892
Arlo, I think you're taking this
much too seriously.

1665
01:18:17,894 --> 01:18:18,492
It's just business.

1666
01:18:18,494 --> 01:18:21,429
Get your ass
in the car, Marcus.

1667
01:18:22,098 --> 01:18:24,632
Tell them I'll be
about 10 minutes late.

1668
01:18:24,634 --> 01:18:27,068
Yes, Mr. Marcus.

1669
01:18:27,070 --> 01:18:29,203
Buckle your seat belt.

1670
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:36,377
Marcus,
we can do it.

1671
01:18:36,379 --> 01:18:37,545
We can make up
the money.

1672
01:18:37,547 --> 01:18:39,480
Look, I know
you're disappointed, arlo,

1673
01:18:39,482 --> 01:18:41,682
but I--I just
don't think that--

1674
01:18:41,684 --> 01:18:43,384
excuse me!

1675
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:46,954
It's just a question

1676
01:18:46,956 --> 01:18:48,155
of accelerating
the schedule.

1677
01:18:48,157 --> 01:18:51,392
All we need is 3 teams
working on the train itself.

1678
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:54,195
Yes. Arlo!

1679
01:18:58,301 --> 01:19:00,968
Arlo, I like
what you're saying,

1680
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:02,636
but who would
coordinate it all?

1681
01:19:02,638 --> 01:19:04,171
You're looking at him.

1682
01:19:04,173 --> 01:19:05,773
Well,
I don't know, arlo.

1683
01:19:05,775 --> 01:19:08,476
I--I'm not sure.
I--I'm--

1684
01:19:08,478 --> 01:19:10,144
well, think about it.

1685
01:19:10,146 --> 01:19:11,679
And while you're
thinking about it,

1686
01:19:11,681 --> 01:19:14,215
take this goddamn wheel.

1687
01:19:14,217 --> 01:19:15,116
What?

1688
01:19:15,118 --> 01:19:15,950
Take the wheel.

1689
01:19:15,952 --> 01:19:17,151
Aah! Where
are you going?!

1690
01:19:17,153 --> 01:19:20,321
I--I can't drive
from the passenger seat!

1691
01:19:23,559 --> 01:19:26,327
Hey! Come on!

1692
01:19:26,329 --> 01:19:28,529
We don't need problems,
mister.

1693
01:19:28,531 --> 01:19:29,730
I don't want your money.

1694
01:19:29,732 --> 01:19:32,233
I want those assholes.

1695
01:19:33,369 --> 01:19:35,736
All: Oh, those assholes.

1696
01:19:35,738 --> 01:19:38,305
Arlo: Let's
get those assholes.

1697
01:19:39,609 --> 01:19:41,642
Man: Get 'em, buddy.

1698
01:19:41,644 --> 01:19:43,043
That's arlo pear, man.

1699
01:19:43,045 --> 01:19:44,311
He's coming back for us.

1700
01:19:44,313 --> 01:19:46,547
Give him a hand.

1701
01:19:54,357 --> 01:19:56,023
Look it! This guy's
fuckin' crazy, man!

1702
01:19:56,025 --> 01:19:57,024
What are you
talkin' about?!

1703
01:19:57,026 --> 01:19:58,459
He's climbing
onto the truck.

1704
01:19:58,461 --> 01:19:59,660
Move!

1705
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:03,531
All right. Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.

1706
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:18,646
Yo, I don't see him
anymore, man.

1707
01:20:18,648 --> 01:20:20,915
I think he fell off.
Good.

1708
01:20:37,433 --> 01:20:40,234
Hyah!

1709
01:20:40,236 --> 01:20:43,470
He's on the roof, man!

1710
01:20:43,472 --> 01:20:44,839
Hey, what--

1711
01:20:44,841 --> 01:20:48,943
how's it hanging?

1712
01:20:51,247 --> 01:20:54,181
I can't see the road!

1713
01:21:05,795 --> 01:21:08,596
Ooh ooh!

1714
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:13,601
Whoo!

1715
01:21:15,438 --> 01:21:16,837
Yo, man, he looks crazy.

1716
01:21:16,839 --> 01:21:18,539
That's right, fuckhead.
I'm crazy!

1717
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:20,641
Come on.
I'll take care of you, man.

1718
01:21:21,878 --> 01:21:25,212
Ooh! Ha!

1719
01:21:32,088 --> 01:21:33,354
Yaah!

1720
01:21:33,856 --> 01:21:35,189
Now, look here,
Mr. pear.

1721
01:21:35,191 --> 01:21:37,591
If you got any complaints
about our service,

1722
01:21:37,593 --> 01:21:39,159
you better call
the head office.

1723
01:21:39,161 --> 01:21:41,729
Shut the hell up.
No more talk!

1724
01:21:41,731 --> 01:21:43,530
I want my furniture!

1725
01:21:43,532 --> 01:21:44,598
Who you think
you're talkin' to?

1726
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:48,636
I'll stomp a mud hole
in your ass, poop-butt.

1727
01:21:54,143 --> 01:21:58,345
Aah!

1728
01:22:42,692 --> 01:22:43,857
Shit.

1729
01:22:43,859 --> 01:22:45,326
Yaah!

1730
01:22:45,328 --> 01:22:47,328
Ooh!

1731
01:23:21,797 --> 01:23:25,265
Honey, I'm home.

1732
01:23:29,705 --> 01:23:31,505
Look what I found.

1733
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:33,273
I found our shit.

1734
01:23:33,275 --> 01:23:34,908
I brought our shit home.

1735
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:37,478
This is our shit.

1736
01:23:48,824 --> 01:23:51,925
Like I said,
they key to a successful move

1737
01:23:51,927 --> 01:23:52,793
is proper preparation.

1738
01:23:52,795 --> 01:23:55,562
Well, I've got a surprise
for you, too.

1739
01:23:55,564 --> 01:23:57,931
Well, whup it on me.

1740
01:23:57,933 --> 01:24:00,300
Casey!

1741
01:24:00,302 --> 01:24:02,936
Get out of here!

1742
01:24:02,938 --> 01:24:03,971
Hello.

1743
01:24:03,973 --> 01:24:06,440
Daddy,
what happened to you?

1744
01:24:06,442 --> 01:24:08,442
Nothing. I'm fine.

1745
01:24:08,444 --> 01:24:10,177
I'm the king of Idaho.

1746
01:24:11,013 --> 01:24:14,648
Come on, you guys!
Let's move it!

1747
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:16,316
Move it!

1748
01:24:16,318 --> 01:24:18,352
Excuse me, Mrs. pear.

1749
01:24:18,354 --> 01:24:20,187
Where would you
like this?

1750
01:24:21,490 --> 01:24:22,489
Down the hall
by the door.

1751
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:25,659
I think that's the perfect
placement for it,

1752
01:24:25,661 --> 01:24:27,928
if you don't mind
my saying so.

1753
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:44,545
Arlo.

1754
01:24:44,547 --> 01:24:45,512
I've been thinking

1755
01:24:45,514 --> 01:24:47,648
about what you were
talking about,

1756
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:49,116
and you can
build the train,

1757
01:24:49,118 --> 01:24:51,785
but you can't
drive the train.

1758
01:24:51,787 --> 01:24:53,353
All right!

1759
01:24:53,355 --> 01:24:55,456
Thank you.

1760
01:24:55,458 --> 01:24:56,723
Congratulations.

1761
01:24:56,725 --> 01:24:57,858
I'll see you
at work.

1762
01:24:57,860 --> 01:24:58,959
I'll give you a ride home.

1763
01:24:58,961 --> 01:25:02,396
Oh, no. No, thanks.
I'll walk.

1764
01:25:02,398 --> 01:25:06,567
After all,
it's a beautiful day.

1765
01:25:06,569 --> 01:25:09,369
Yes, it sure is.

1766
01:25:13,509 --> 01:25:14,508
Excuse me, kids.

1767
01:25:35,865 --> 01:25:37,664
What the fuck
are you doing?!

1768
01:25:37,666 --> 01:25:40,767
I want you to take
this big red motherfucker

1769
01:25:40,769 --> 01:25:42,469
and put it back
in your garage.

1770
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:44,004
Do you understand,
you son of a bitch?!

1771
01:25:44,006 --> 01:25:48,475
And go to the store and buy
you a human-sized mower!

1772
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:50,811
Yeah?

1773
01:25:53,949 --> 01:25:56,650
And who's
gonna make me?

1774
01:25:56,652 --> 01:25:57,751
You?

1775
01:26:03,626 --> 01:26:05,125
Flipper!

1776
01:26:05,127 --> 01:26:07,861
I don't want any trouble.

1777
01:26:07,863 --> 01:26:11,031
Come on, flipper.
Let's go home.

1778
01:26:11,033 --> 01:26:13,967
Boy, let's go!
Come on, flipper.

1779
01:26:22,611 --> 01:26:25,679
Cornell: You're all right,
neighbor.

1780
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:31,385
We're gonna get along
just fine.
