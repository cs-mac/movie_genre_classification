Honey, I'm so proud

You're such a star.
Isn't he a star?

25
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,747
He is a superstar.

26

Now, that is how
you announce your engagement!

27
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:01,984
That was genius.

28
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,387
You're the talk of the town!
- Hey, RJ.

29

Could you imagine this
five years ago, bro?

30
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,617
With a girl like that?
Hell, no.

31
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:12,597
Hit show, big mansion on the
block. Now I'm international.

32
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:13,927
You look great,
by the way.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,492
Shit, man, that's all this
tofu Bianca got me eating.

34
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,471
Besides the hunger pains,
being a vegan is the shit.

35
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,572
Cheers.
Honey! Telephone.

36
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:28,307
Get going.

37
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:31,544
That sounds
wonderful. I can't wait.

38
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,545
Great.

39
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,584
Well, it's nice speaking
to you. Okay, hold on.

40
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,492
It's your mom. Hurry up.
Talk. We still have guests.

41
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:42,960
Hi!
- Hi there!

42
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,862
You made it. Oh, my God.
You look amazing!

43
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,393
Hey, Mama.

44
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,403
Well, hello, stranger.

45
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,668
We're just beginning to think
you just forgot all about us.

46
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:58,177
No, Mama. I can't forget
my number one girl.

47
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,478
<i>And I didn't forget
your anniversary, either.</i>

48
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:05,644
I sent y'all
a 50" plasma TV.

49
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,720
One inch for every year.

50
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:12,385
That's sweet, baby. But
we'd much rather meet Blanca.

51
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,449
She sounds so nice.

52
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,825
<i>Bianca, Mama.
Not Blanca.</i>

53
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:21,225
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought it was Blanca.</i>

54
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,963
<i>Well, baby, you know
it's our 50th anniversary.</i>

55
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,939
Mama, I don't think we're
gonna be able to make it.

56
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,307
Jamaal, you know, he's
got this big soccer game.

57
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,175
<i>The boy loves himself
some soccer, Mama.</i>

58
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,977
<i>I know. He talks to
Papa all the time.</i>

59
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,642
Jamaal and Daddy
have been talking?

60
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,982
And writing letters.

61
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:45,684
<i>Lord... You know, we haven't seen
that child since he was a baby.</i>

62
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:48,124
<i>You've just got to come.
Everybody's coming.</i>

63
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,424
<i>We got Ellie
and Cleavon,</i>

64
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,293
Clyde and Lucinda and...

65
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,992
<i>Lucinda?
Oh, yes.</i>

66
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,193
Lucinda and Clyde?

67
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,428
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

68
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,493
<i>They're coming together?
I forgot to tell you.</i>

69
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,697
But I... I thought...

70
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,399
<i>That's a lot
of questions, boy.</i>

71
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,199
Hey, Daddy.

72
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:08,043
Especially from someone who has shown
very little interest in his family.

73
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,103
Yes, sir, but I...

74
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:13,278
If you can find the time to
explore "The Mind Of A Stripper"

75
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:17,049
or "Sisters Gone Wild"
with your so-called "family,"

76
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:20,854
then you can find the time to
spend with your actual family.

77
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,258
So you've been watching!

78
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:25,195
Boy, don't disappoint
your mother.

79
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,651
Go, Jamaal!

80
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:49,949
There you go,
there you go!

81
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,115
Boy, that
kid's good.

82
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,215
Right. Move.
Push it!

83
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,284
Come on, get it, get it,
get it, get it! Right there!

84
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,022
Let it go, Jamaal!

85
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,926
That's a winner, Jamaal!

86
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,973
Hey, RJ, I'll see you later, man. Okay,
take care. You tell Jamaal I said bye.

87
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:14,512
Jamaal, way to go. Way to
go. That's how you do that.

88
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,241
Good going, guys!
Yeah!

89
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,782
That's my boy.
That's my boy.

90
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:27,684
That's a lot of running for one
goal. But, hey, at least you hit it.

91
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,988
Dad, you should
come more often.

92
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,122
Hey, I'm here.

93
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:36,527
Dad, why don't you want to go
to Dry Springs?

94
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,765
Come on.
Not you, too.

95
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,399
Papa Jenkins says
Dry Springs is awesome.

96
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,273
He said all my cousins'll be
there and I'd have a lot of fun.

97
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,473
Oh, really? What else
do y'all talk about?

98
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:53,781
I don't know. School, my
friends, soccer, global warming.

99
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,343
Global warming?

100
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:59,585
We talk about a lot of stuff.
He's really cool.

101
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,524
Can't we please go?

102
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,491
I'll think about it, Jamaal.

103
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,594
Oh. Talk it over
with the boss, first.

104
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,097
Boss?

105
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,173
Son, men run things
in a relationship.

106
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,150
And between us men, never let a woman
tell you what to do, and how to do it.

107
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,552
Your dad's
in complete control.

108
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:32,749
Who's in control?

109
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,884
Tell me.
Who's in control?

110
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,019
I don't know!

111
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,153
Take me higher,
you can do it!

112
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,288
Oh, no.

113
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:41,356
Come on. Take me. Harder!

114
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,368
Come on, lover!
Mama!

115
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,131
<i>Yes!
Oh, shit!</i>

116
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,262

Yes!</i>

118
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,074
Oh.

119
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,415
Speaking in tongues.
That's a first.

120
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,718
I'm so proud of you.

121
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,450
I want to look hot

122
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,864
So now...
Time for my seven miles.

123
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,394
Can you untie me first?

124
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:23,600
Babe?

125
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,337

126
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,976

I booked the tickets.

127

Honey? I'm hearing a tinge
of doubt in your voice.

128
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:43,758
I'm cool. You know, it's... It'll be
four days, then we get back to our lives.

129
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,229
Exactly.

130
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,592
This will solidify
our union to the world.

131
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:54,071
We'll tape your parents' banquet, you
make a heartfelt speech, and the ratings?

132
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,732
Oh, my God!

133
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,336
Yeah.

in these bags, anyway?

158
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,571
You went 39 days on a desert island
with... With a toothpick and a thong.

159
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,104
I need options.

160
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,376
Damn the options.
I need room.

161
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,719
I'd be happy
to check that for you.

162
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,119
Hell, no!

163
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,292
I had some bad experiences.

164
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,655
I'll just slip it
in the captain's closet.

165
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,999
It's the safest place
it could be.

166
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,852
Let's get
this party started.

167
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,083
Uh-uh-uh.

168
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:26,988
I got you beet juice.

169
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,549
Come on, baby,
I want to live a little.

170
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,959
Precisely.

171
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,724
It's an excellent
source of antioxidants.

172
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,788
Your drink, sir.
Drink up.

173
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,389
Enjoy.

174
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,301
<i>Once we have reached
a comfortable...</i>

175
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,669
Hey, Dad?

176
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,832
Yeah, son?

177
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,374
This is gonna be
great. Thanks.

178
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:45,774
Anything for you,
my man.

179
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:56,549
<i>And now we ask you to please relax,
sit back and enjoy the flight.</i>

180
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,989
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Georgia.</i>

181
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,757
How does his bag get lost
in a captain's closet?

182
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,661
Explain that to me.
Yes, ma'am.

183
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:07,721
Where's your father?

184
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,233
He won't come out
of the bathroom.

185
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:12,065
<i>The white zone is for immediate
loading and unloading only.</i>

186
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,265
Honey, how do
the pants fit?

187
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:19,510
<i>Flight 514 from Atlanta, your
luggage will be at Carousel 2.</i>

188
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,657
You mean to tell me

189
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,291
this is the only pair of pants you
could find in this country-ass airport?

190
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,666
I like it. Colors
look fabulous on you.

191
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:49,203
Babe, I look
like a clown.

192
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,341
Look... Look at how tight
these are. Look!

193
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,775
I see that, tiger.

194
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,908
Come. Let's get the car.

195
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,824
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, for
your own safety and protection,</i>

196
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,361
<i>please do not leave
your bags unattended.</i>

197
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,966
Wow, the whole weekend is planned.

198
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,872
There's a barbecue today,
a softball game tomorrow,

199
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,705
a fish fry on Saturday.

200
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,143
Oh, look! An obstacle course race!

201
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,909
And the anniversary
banquet's Sunday night.

202
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,244
Cool!

203
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,918
Nice ears, Dad.

204
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,520
Oh, man.
Nice picture, Dad.

205
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,619
Oh, man.

206
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,596
Hey, now!

207
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:58,803
How terribly quaint.
As if time stood still.

208
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,808
It has. I told you, don't
nothing ever happen around here.

209
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,740
What the hell?

210
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,678
That shit was
tight, right?

211
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,689
Oh, damn!

212
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,860
Oh, my God, baby, you
get me so freaking hot!

213
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,758
Do you know them?

214
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,459
I don't know her, but
that's my cousin Reggie.

215
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,964
You got your jewelry?
You got your purse?

216
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,527
All right? 'Cause the
boy could con Jesus.

217
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,269
Oh, no. Oh, no,
that's him.

218
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,002
Oh, that's him!
Who?

219
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,270
Here he comes,
here he comes.

220
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:36,804
My nigga Roscoe Steven Jenkins!
Hollywood did came to town!

221
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,877
What's up?
What's up, dawg?

222
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,177
What up, cuz?
What up, cuz?

223
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,188
How you doing?
How you do...

224
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:45,920
Come on, man,
give it up!

225
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,720
Man, what's happening?
All right.

226
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,488
Oh, man,
look at what you...

227
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,792
Look, you got them
picnic tablecloth pants on.

228
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:55,231
"Hey, Boo-Boo, let me get
another picnic basket. "

229
00:13:55,301 --> 00:14:00,466
I guess Outkast's about to name
their third member. Li'I Roscoe 1000.

230
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,007
Yeah, but don't be mad 'cause
you ain't up on the style.

231
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,100
Ain't that right, baby?
Roscoe?

232
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,345
Why do you
call him Roscoe?

233
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,540
That's his government name.

234
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:14,246
Oh, not into full
disclosure. I see.

235
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,151
Okay. Welcome to the family.

236
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,348
Thank you.

237
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,653
Lookie here,
lookie here.

238
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:23,456
<i>First it was Survivor, now
it's America's Next Top Model.</i>

239
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,224
Oh, stop it.
Really?

240
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,958
Oh, hell, yeah, really!

241
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,325
My God, I'll drink your dishwater,
bathwater, all types of waters.

242
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:32,893
I'll drink
all your waters.

243
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,439
Boy, you do your thing.
Get... Get off me.

244
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,406
Look at you doing your thing,
boy! Hey, will you stop that?

245
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:37,806
Thing, boy! You do
your thing. Get off me!

246
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,936
Do your thing, boy. You do
your thing. Hey, get off.

247
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,377
Hey, why'd you keep
checking my pockets, Reggie?

248
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,415
Oh, you do your thing. Man, you
need to get me out there to LA.

249
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:44,540
Would you lookie here?
Look.

250
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:45,879
Hi!
Hi!

251
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,350
I'm Amy.

252
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:50,217
Yeah, me and Amy are friends,
man. You know what I'm saying?

253
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,258
She's been a real inspiration to
me, putting my new hip-hop album out.

254
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,383
You know what
I'm saying?

255
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,485
And my dad's company
is financing it.

256
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,429
It's Pimp Nasty
Records! Word!

257
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,557
Pimp Nasty?
- Like that.

258
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:05,032
So everything is... Hey, boy,
what the... What you doing?

259
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,765
Get back! Get back!

260
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,898
Water rat! That's a
water rat, right there.

261
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,134
Get back.
Get back.

262
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,540
Reg, come on.

263
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,975
It's okay, Fifi.

264
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,945
Reggie, man.
She's a dog, man.

265
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,174
It's Fiona.

266
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,216
<i>Yo quiero Taco Bell. I
ain't know what it was, man.</i>

267
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,479
I thought it was a little fur
coat with some feet, or something,

268
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,679
that damn walked
over here, boy.

269
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:27,050
Man, Mama J sent us down
here to get some ice.

270
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,115
And?

271
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,626
We're probably
gonna need about 300.

272
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,026
$300?
Yeah.

273
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,859
For some ice?
For some ice.

274
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,490
You must think
I'm a damn fool.

275
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:35,828
No, I know you
ain't no damn fool.

276
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,869
You standing there with that
beautiful lady, right there.

277
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,802
Look like
you a lucky fool.

278
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,437
What? It's just $300,
baby. Go on.

279
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,504
You're not cheap, baby.
Yes, he is.

280
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,448
You don't know him like
we... He's tight. Yeah, he is.

281
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:53,542
It's only $300,
baby.

282
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,450
That's it, $300.
For your family?

283
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,322
Please?

284
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,482
Go on, baby.

285
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,328
For the family.

286
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,637
All right,
good to see you.

287
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,837
Papa?
Huh?

288
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:20,411
They made it!

289
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,506
Told you. Well, come on.

290
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,019
Come on, baby.

291
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,086
Oh, my baby's home!

292
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,422
Hey, Mama.
How you doing?

293
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,789
Well, well.
Look who showed up.

294
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:42,197
My grandson's father,
Dr. RJ Stevens.

295
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,159
It's been a long time, Dr. Stevens.

296
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,364
Dad, that's just
a stage name.

297
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,929
Yeah, I know.

298
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,166
Jamaal, welcome back.

299
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,710
Thanks,
Papa Jenkins.

300
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:57,078
Oh, and this is Blanca!
Pretty girl, Roscoe.

301
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,846
You must got some Indian in
you, all that long, pretty hair.

302
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:05,350
Roscoe, you been eating?
You all skin and bone!

303
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,688
Don't look like
I never nourished you.

304
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,455
I know! Doesn't he look fabulous?

305
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,792
Yeah, he looks
fabulous, all right.

306
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,890
Downright metrosexual, with
them young-ass pants on.

307
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:18,767
Oh, no. You should have seen his
ensemble before his little accident.

308
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,270
It was exquisite.

309
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,830
Are you kidding?
Better than this?

310
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,970
What? I didn't say "outfit. "

311
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,435
Got you!
Pounced on you.

312
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:29,606
Get... Get off.
Get off me!

313
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:30,875
Let me see
how strong you are.

314
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:32,041
Otis!
Yeah.

315
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,209
Get off me.
Come on.

316
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,650
Just like old times again.

317
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,779
Lord, Otis. Do it, do
it! Get out of it, then.

318
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,186
Mama! Mama.
Otis! Otis!

319
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,349
Come on, boy, let's
see what you got.

320
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,414
Let go of me, O.

321
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:44,588
Yeah, go ahead, do it. I want you
to. Boy, introduce me. That's rude.

322
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:53,000
Bianca, this is my country,
neckbone-eating brother, Otis.

323
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:54,765
The sheriff.

324
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,638
Southern hospitality
at your service.

325
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,142
Get up off that!

326
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,472
This here is Ruthie.
Hi.

327
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:02,844
And that's my baby
she's carrying.

328
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,009
Wow, Ruthie, you look
like you're about to pop.

329
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,053
No, I'm just six months.

330
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,884
But I bet y'all be
loading up soon, huh?

331
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:14,454
Oh, God, no! Nothing's
wrecking this figure.

332
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,184
Hmm.

333
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:20,095
At least not right now.
Jamaal, say hello.

334
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,332
Are you really the sheriff?

335
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,390
Mmm-hmm.

336
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:26,700
"To serve and protect. "
And occasionally whoop ass.

337
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,138
Meet your cousins.
Junior! Callie!

338
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,976
Oh, damn!
What are they on?

339
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,912
All steroids
and no carbs?

340
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,576
Them some
thick-ass kids!

341
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:42,119
No, I'm serious. Mama, them
is thick-ass. No, I'm serious.

342
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:45,088
Like, they be 12.
Them some thick-ass...

343
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,488
Respect...

344
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,630
This here's your cousin Jamaal.

345
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,065
Get him a bat, and get
him some batting practice.

346
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,069
And, Callie,
go easy on him.

347
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,233
You got it, Daddy.

348
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:06,001
Come on, son. You and
Granddad'll take them on together.

349
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:08,978
You play baseball,
don't you?

350
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,674
All right,
I guess.

351
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,513
Well, Blanca, you want to come
in the house and freshen up?

352
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:16,520
And, Roscoe, you get the bags and
just take them up to your room.

353
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:17,577
Okay.

354
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,021
And, baby,

355
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:24,791
please find some clothes that fit. You
got all your business in the street.

356
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,732
Oh, God. It's good to see you, man.

357
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,171
Little help
with the bags, O?

358
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:40,610
Man, I ain't no bellhop. Plus,
I ain't had my steroids today.

359
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,604
Got you!

360
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,878
Southern hospitality!
Yeah, right.

361
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,017
And next time
you grabbing on people,

362
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:52,716
wear some deodorant,
you little fake-ass Conan!

363
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,351
Oh, shit!
Mama! Mama!

364
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,989
Come here, boy! I'm an all-State
linebacker! Look at that speed!

365
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,465
Mama! I said leave me
alone, O! Leave me alone!

366
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,903
I haven't had so many people in
the kitchen since I don't know when.

367
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,501
No, you use this one.

368
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,605
You a bad bitch!

369
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,479
Oh! Oh!

370
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,281
Wait a minute, girl. I'm
serious. I'm serious. You bad!

371
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,220
<i>You are the baddest
bitch Survivor ever had.</i>

372
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,758
Soon to be my sister-in-law,
up in my kitchen, girl.

373
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,191
I'm honored!

374
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,285
Thank you.

375
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,953
All right, now, now, now,
tell me the truth, okay?

376
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,658
Tell me the truth, 'cause
it's you and me. We relating.

377
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,134
Can that hook-head handle you?
'Cause, see, we a lot alike, Binaca.

378
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:41,866
'Cause we too much woman
for one man! You feel me?

379
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,001
Betty, let
the child breathe.

380
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,202
Now, is the tea ready?

381
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,335
It's right here, Mama.

382
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,742
Binaca, you got to
try my tea, girl.

383
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:51,806
I'm telling you right now, this tea
right here ain't no joke, Balolo.

384
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:53,009
Best in the county.

385
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,645
It's Bianca.
That's what I said.

386
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,746
And I'd love to. Cheers!

387
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,461
God, that's liquid
diabetes! You drink that?

388
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,657
No, no. No, no, wait
a minute now, baby.

389
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,326
Don't get
all uppity, okay?

390
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,666
'Cause I'm gonna let you know
the brothers down at the pen,

391
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:16,265
they rave about my sweet tea
every Sunday at my Bible reading.

392
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:19,606
It ain't the sweet tea. It's
them short skirts you be wearing.

393
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:23,444
I'm just doing my part,
trying to be a good Christian.

394
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:26,712
And if them brothers need
to get a peek at this thong

395
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,345
to get them through
them long lonely nights,

396
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:34,984
then, Father God and all the heavens
up above and the Episcopals, so be it!

397
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,391
Girl, don't make me sick.
You know I'm pregnant.

398
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,863
Thank you. Betty, your thong
is an image I do not need.

399
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,092
Ditto.

400
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,025
Wait a minute.

401
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:48,129
Now, see, we trying to bond with
you and everything, welcome you in,

402
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,868
but you getting it twisted.
You getting me twisted.

403
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,035
But don't get it twisted.

404
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:57,741
This kitchen here is my domain.
My domain. This ain't no kennel.

405
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:03,754
And then this lab rat got to go. Got to go.
Do you hear me? Am I clear? I bites dogs.

406
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,957
Know who I am, okay?

407
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,583
Now ditto that!

408
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:12,161
<i>Yes, sir. Can I help you?
Yes, sir. Yeah, hello.</i>

409
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,164
<i>Yeah. What is your name?
Patricia.</i>

410
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,563
<i>Luqueesha?
I can barely hear you.</i>

411
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,067
Look here,
Luqueesha, somebody...

412
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:18,830
<i>Sir, could you
please hold?</i>

413
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,428
Yeah, I'll hold.

414
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,566
Bucky?

415
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:58,538
You done messed around
and got old, huh, Bucky?

416
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,202
You still alive?

417
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,775
Yeah, you used to terrorize me
when I was little.

418
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:10,185
I don't play that now, man. I'm a grown
man. Look at me when I'm talking to you.

419
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:13,283
I should kick you in
your ass right now, Bucky.

420
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:15,519
Yeah. Yeah, when you
bit my ankle, I should...

421
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:16,754
<i>Hello, Dr. Stevens?</i>

422
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,420
Yeah, excuse me.

423
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:19,555
<i>We found your bag.</i>

424
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:20,996
Well, all right.
Well, that's more like it.

425
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,795
<i>We just need an address.</i>

426
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,265
Get off me, you crazy dog!

427
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,365
What the hell?

428
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,013
You gonna stay inside
all day, Dr. Stevens?

429
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,347
No, sir.

430
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,822
Daddy, you don't
have to call me that.

431
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,653
I just don't want to
offend the star.

432
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:47,919
Offend me?

433
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:52,555
Hey, hey, Daddy, how come
you never opened this plasma?

434
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,565
I don't need
a skinny TV.

435
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,966
That console's been there
since 1977. Good picture.

436
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:03,072
Daddy, this is
a Hi-Def flat screen!

437
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:07,111
Football on Sundays, them
hits'll be like, "Boom!"

438
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,908
Make you feel like
you really there.

439
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,005
I am really gonna be there.

440
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,016
Your cousin Clyde
gave me season tickets.

441
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:18,746
See that picture?
That's his third dealership.

442
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:22,719
Man, that Clyde
is something special.

443
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,328
Yeah, Clyde's special.

444
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:33,070
I gotta get outside. I'm grooming
the next Jackie Robinson. My grandson.

445
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,242
Reg.
Huh?

446
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,289
That don't look
like $300 worth of ice.

447
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:54,985
It's hot down here, man. Half of
it melted before you even got down.

448
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,857
I'm telling you,
the bag was...

449
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,328
It's hot down... Ask anybody
about the heat, 'Scoe.

450
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:00,625
I ain't gonna lie
about none of that, man.

451
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,291
Whatever.

452
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:03,834
Hey, O.
Yo.

453
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:07,167
How old is crazy-ass Bucky?
Shouldn't he be dead by now?

454
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,400
Bucky's at least 25 now.

455
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,169
Yeah. Yeah, that dog is old, boy.

456
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,574
Are you serious?

457
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:15,272
That's 175 people years!

458
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,440
And he's still a little
player, I'm telling you.

459
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,746
You better watch
little Fiona around here.

460
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:24,016
He gonna hit her in the one that
stink and not the one that wink.

461
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,920
He good at scooping up behind you.

462
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:31,858
So, did I hear Clyde
was coming with Lucinda?

463
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:35,890
Mmm-hmm.

464
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,764
Should be here
any minute now.

465
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,198
I thought
she was engaged.

466
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,261
Uh-uh.

467
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,772
That ended a while ago, baby bro.

468
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,900
Yeah, that... Man, no,
she moved to Atlanta, man,

469
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:48,468
and that smooth nigga Clyde supposed
to be hollering at her again.

470
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:52,039
What you mean, "again"? He
ain't never been with her. Never!

471
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,816
Lookie here.
Little Hollywood man.

472
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,319
"He's never been
with her. Never!"

473
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,412
"Never!"

474
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:01,050
What, you look like you trying
to throw your hat in the ring.

475
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:04,493
No, I'm just setting the
record straight, bubblehead.

476
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,393
Set the record
straight on this. Now.

477
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:10,991
Good God Almighty,
I smell them funky ribs!

478
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,833
Yeah, baby, they're
good, too. Here, baby bro.

479
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:18,137
Now, I need your discriminate tongue
to let me know if I'm still on track.

480
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,234
You know how
I gets down.

481
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,612
Give him some bread
and a Pepsi, right now!

482
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,381
No, no, I'm cool. I'm
gonna wait on the chicken.

483
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:31,611
Skinless.

484
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,289
Why? You Muslim now?
Yeah, what the hell?

485
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,485
You a Five Percenter?

486
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,584
Nah.

487
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:40,620
I just adopted a low-fat,
high-fiber diet. Bianca and I...

488
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,994
"Bianca and I... "
I know what it is.

489
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,866
The black Paris Hilton done
sissified you off the pig.

490
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,598
That's what's up.
It ain't like that, O.

491
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:50,505
Bullshit! You on that
Hollywood shit. Nigga, please.

492
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:55,512
Give me... Let me see this. You see
this swine is fine, divine, sublime

493
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,514
and right on time.
Right on time!

494
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,378
Man! Look at that.

495
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,612
Want some of this
dipping sauce, baby?

496
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:03,779
Yeah, go on. Get... Go on,
taste a little piece of that.

497
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:06,050
Don't be scared. You got
on the Kwanzaa outfit now.

498
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,649
Go on, get down, like you live.
Go ahead and taste a piece of that.

499
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,024
Bite that.
Go on, man.

500
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,393
How about a piece,
Nelson Mandela?

501
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,761
Stop being so scary, man.

502
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:16,265
Farrakhan ain't
nowhere around here.

503
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:17,596
Man!
What's up, man?

504
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:21,605
<i>Come on! The Last King
from Scotland. Look.</i>

505
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,334
With the Forest Whitaker eye.

506
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,737
Wait, look. Put a little
barbecue sauce on the dead eye.

507
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,574
Might jump up out of there.

508
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,475
Boy, you crazy.

509
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:37,645
Yes, indeed, that's gonna be
good! Stir that up for me, Bilante.

510
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,485
Now, in episode 11, did you
have to pull your titties out?

511
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,425
I had to have
that chocolate cake.

512
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,056
But you threw it up.
On purpose.

513
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:51,296
<i>Whether on Survivor or in life,
I believe in winning at all costs.</i>

514
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,505
That's why RJ and I
are perfectly matched.

515
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,970
Girl, you tripping.

516
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,444
You better mind out, Betty.

517
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,810
Come on now, Mama.

518
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,543
Roscoe and winning don't
even go in the same sentence.

519
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:08,108
Only Clyde gets that distinction.

520
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,619
Who's Clyde?

521
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,746
Oh.

522
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,255
I'm glad you asked.

523
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:15,850
Clyde is our cousin. He came to live
with us once his folks went on to glory.

524
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:18,953
They became famous and
left their child behind?

525
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,691
Bitch, are you crazy?

526
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:23,996
They was in a car accident.
They dead. Goddamn!

527
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:28,699
Anyway, now Roscoe and Clyde
was fierce rivals, though "rival"

528
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:33,176
is not quite accurate, 'cause Clyde used
to whoop Roscoe's tail in everything.

529
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,337
I don't know about
"everything," now, Betty.

530
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,381
Everything, Mama!

531
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,408
<i>Basketball.</i>

532
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:41,679
Game!

533
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,317
<i>Checkers.</i>

534
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:46,646
King me.

535
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,851
<i>Chess.</i>

536
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,722
Checkmate.

537
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:51,284
<i>Arm wrestling.</i>

538
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:55,790
Oops.

539
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,027
That was me.

540
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,002
You're telling me
RJ never won?

541
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,162
Never.

542
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,639
That is, of course, until
the obstacle course in 1985.

543
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,201
Obstacle course?

544
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,403
<i>Yep. It's a
Jenkins family tradition.</i>

545
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,468
Have fun, now!

546
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:09,638
Yeah!

547
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:13,650
Clyde, Roscoe,
we got our eyes on you!

548
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:15,618
<i>Clyde and Roscoe
made a bet</i>

549
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:20,283
<i>that the winner would get to ask
Lucinda Allen to the Spring Formal.</i>

550
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,622
And who is Lucinda Allen?

551
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:26,391
<i>Only the most popular Southern belle
to ever come out of these parts.</i>

552
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,625
<i>The Spring Formal Queen
that year.</i>

553
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,792
<i>So what happened?</i>

554
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:33,360
Girl, your man took off
like a house on fire!

555
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:37,802
Come on!

556
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:41,474
He moved through that obstacle
course faster than a runaway slave.

557
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:42,808
Doing it!

558
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:53,646
<i>Now, see, Clyde was right there with
his skinny ass, baby, neck and neck.</i>

559
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:56,592
<i>He was trying to hold on
until the end.</i>

560
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:57,787
<i>But old Roscoe...
Come on!</i>

561
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:00,353
<i>Old Roscoe broke
that tape, baby.</i>

562
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:03,832
<i>He smiled so hard, I thought
his cheeks would burst.</i>

563
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,130
Yes!

564
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,700
Yes! I won!

565
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,606
<i>I ain't never seen Mama and
Daddy so proud as that day.</i>

566
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,002
Aw.

567
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:17,275
Now all Roscoe had to do
was claim the real prize.

568
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,042
Lucinda?
Hey.

569
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:24,751
Will you go to the
Spring Formal with me?

570
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:29,951
Oh, Roscoe, how sweet,
but Clyde just asked me.

571
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,159
Come on, Lucinda,
let's get a strawberry soda.

572
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,133
My treat.
- Okay.

573
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,035
Bye, Roscoe.
Great race.

574
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:42,771
Bye.

575
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,468
<i>I felt bad for the boy.</i>

576
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:50,208
Now, nobody knew about the bet, so
Clyde just beat him to the punch.

577
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:57,486
<i>Clyde and Lucinda danced all night
long, looking like eternal lovers.</i>

578
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,220
<i>And Roscoe looked
like a hot mess.</i>

579
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:05,759
<i>And his date
wasn't much better.</i>

580
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,264
<i>Lord Jesus!</i>

581
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:15,873
But in typical Roscoe
fashion, he snitched.

582
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:17,202
But that
mess backfired.

583
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:22,474
Lucinda is a young lady,
not some trophy you can win!

584
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:25,149
I'm very disappointed
in you.

585
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,706
But what about Clyde?

586
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:29,184
Clyde will be dealt with.

587
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:33,355
Now drop your britches
and bend over.

588
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:42,490
Yipe!

589
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:46,298
<i>But that Clyde...
Girl, he is a smooth operator.</i>

590
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:49,499
All right, what have you
got to say for yourself?

591
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,201
I let Roscoe win.

592
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:55,005
It meant more
to him to beat me,

593
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,242
and it meant more to me
to go out with Lucinda.

594
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,780
She's so beautiful.

595
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,382
I know you're disappointed,

596
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:08,291
and if my parents were alive,
they'd be disappointed, too.

597
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,623
But you're the only
parent I got, Papa Jenkins.

598
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:13,960
So you do what you think
is right. I'll understand.

599
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:23,300
Don't you ever let something
like this ever happen again.

600
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:24,705
What?

601
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,300
You understand?

602
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:31,245
Yes, sir.

603
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,386
<i>He went upstairs
and cried like a baby.</i>

604
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,722
Now, how you know
Roscoe was crying?

605
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:49,525
<i>Because all his hollering
woke me up from a sound sleep.</i>

606
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,902
So, are they
still an item?

607
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:59,342
They dated awhile, but you know, the
Queen is too pure for the likes of Clyde.

608
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,002
He needs a real woman.

609
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,171
Betty, y'all are cousins.

610
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:03,304
Whatever!

611
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:09,276
Now, the point is, Roscoe ain't been
the same since Clyde stole Miss Lucinda.

612
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,950
I think they call
that "evolution. "

613
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:17,819
RJ's clearly over
any childhood crush.

614
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,629
Really?
Really.

615
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:23,826
Well, where do you think that
"Team of Me" mess started?

616
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,764
All right, Betty,
that is enough.

617
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,034
Okay, Mama,
but I'm just saying...

618
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,736
Come on in this house
before I pop you.

619
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,334
Now, somebody
help that white girl.

620
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:37,347
She getting eggshells in
the tater salad. Help her.

621
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:40,179
Always running your
mouth! You talk too much.

622
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,446
Don't nobody want
no crunchy-ass potato salad.

623
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,289
And you put vinegar on these? Yeah.

624
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,381
You gotta
market these, O.

625
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,128
RJ!
Huh?

626
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,996
What the hell
are you eating?

627
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:59,794
I'm not eating, baby,
I'm tasting. These soy ribs.

628
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,270
You want some?

629
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,499
Forget it, carnivore!

630
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:05,303
Why don't you tell me
about Lucinda Allen?

631
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,400
Oh. Oh, shit.

632
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:07,842
Lucinda Allen? That was
a bad one, right there.

633
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:11,073
Well, see, I... Baby,
she's just, you know...

634
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:15,245
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Hey, Clyde's here now!

635
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,384
Let me introduce you.

636
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,215
What's up, family?

637
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:54,184
Hi! Hey there, baby.
What's up, baby?

638
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,192
You looking sharp. Look at
you. Girl, Betty, you too much.

639
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,751
Clyde! What's up, O?
What's up, Big Law?

640
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,889
I see you ain't getting no
bigger. Look at you, boy.

641
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:01,954
Look at you, boy!

642
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,364
Lucinda,
what's up, baby?

643
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,129
Oh, my God, hi!

644
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:06,397
Good seeing you, baby.

645
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:08,803
Hey, look at you, boy. Look.
You sure you our relative?

646
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,837
Little Mexican!

647
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:12,671
I got a little something
for everybody!

648
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:15,735
I stopped to pick up some red
velvet cakes for the picnic.

649
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:19,280
From Cooter's Bakery
in Tuscaloosa?

650
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,681
Yeah.

651
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:23,811
Well, you only get one
golden anniversary, Mama J.

652
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,913
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, yeah.

653
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:29,821
Hey! Hey, now!

654
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:33,352
There he is! What's up,
Papa J? How you doing, man?

655
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:35,126
Is the fountain of youth
around here somewhere,

656
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,291
or you been
taking that Viagra?

657
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,164
You better watch it.

658
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,834
See, 'Cinda?
Lucinda!

659
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,428
I'm so glad to see you.
Welcome home.

660
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:42,598
Oh. Oh.

661
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:48,839
Now that's nostalgia for you, right
there. Family spirit award goes to Roscoe!

662
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:51,507
Cross Colour Jones!
Look at you, boy!

663
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:53,675
Still wearing Otis'
hand-me-downs. Come here, man.

664
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:55,218
They're in the bag.

665
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,316
Well, the airlines
lost my bag, so...

666
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:00,017
What's your excuse?

667
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,855
Man... Hey, man,
this that Tiger Hoods, man.

668
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,487
You know me.
I get my nine holes in.

669
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:08,130
Roscoe Jenkins.

670
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:10,422
Oh.

671
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,331
Oh, it's been ages.

672
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,634
Wow, it's been so long!

673
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:21,203
Clyde, Lucinda,
this is my fiancee...

674
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,211
My fiancee...
Bianca.

675
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,909
Bianca Kittles. How
you doing? Bianca!

676
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:29,111
Sweeter than Skittles.
Girl, you prettier in person.

677
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,518
Is that so?

678
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,719
You find somebody that say different,
see if I don't slap them to sleep.

679
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,282
And I don't even
get violent.

680
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,260
It's my pleasure, Bianca.

681
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:42,028
Wow, congratulations, you two.
The pleasure's mine.

682
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:46,968
What's up
with that?

683
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:51,299
<i>And, Lord, we thank you
for the pork ribs,</i>

684
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,105
<i>as well as, yes,
the coleslaw, and...</i>

685
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,738
I hear what you're saying,
but look, I gotta go.

686
00:36:56,814 --> 00:37:00,045
<i>Thank You! And we thank You
for the sweet potato pie,</i>

687
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:04,781
<i>and, yes, for the scrumptious
red velvet cakes from Cooter's!</i>

688
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,289
<i>We thank You, Lord!
And they all did say,</i>

689
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,258
Amen!

690
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,762
We thank you for that
beautiful benediction.

691
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,422
You mean long.
- Otis!

692
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:17,592
Mama and I are just filled with joy

693
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:22,629
that so many friends and family have
joined us on this very special occasion.

694
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:25,708
This woman has put up
with me for five decades,

695
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:29,268
and I love her now more
than ever. Thank you, baby.

696
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,472
All right, Papa J.
Hear, hear, now.

697
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:37,110
Clyde, you try some
of this corn, baby?

698
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:40,214
And don't you forget these rolls,
'cause I made them with you in mind.

699
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,259
You butter the biscuits?
You know I did.

700
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:43,657
Hey, Betty? Betty.

701
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:44,820
What?

702
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:48,023
He's your cousin,
not a potential tip.

703
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,067
You know what, Otis?
Okay? Shut up.

704
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:54,332
Now, I'm just glad to see him, that's
all. And, and... Okay, you, too, queenie.

705
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,567
Thank you, Betty.

706
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,843
So, Lucinda, I hear you two
were high school sweethearts.

707
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,938
Oh, well, that was
a long time ago.

708
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,177
Yeah. But you never
forget your first love.

709
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:10,618
Ain't that right,
'Cinda?

710
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,315
Yeah,
I guess not.

711
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:16,250
Look at her. Just
as beautiful as ever.

712
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:18,295
You know, I'm gonna leave
some of these hood-rats alone

713
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:21,388
and get real serious about
making this girl Mrs. Stubbs.

714
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,626
You know, matter of fact,
Otis, get me a broom right now.

715
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:26,966
I'm gonna jump!
Mazel tov!

716
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:29,203
You know what I'm
talking about, Otis?

717
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:30,501
Don't believe
this one, okay?

718
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:33,873
He's more interested in jumping
bones than jumping brooms.

719
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,070
Ooh.

720
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,274
Well, best of luck to the both
of you. You make a great couple.

721
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,078
Bullshit!

722
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,209
Betty!

723
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:46,618
Excuse me, y'all, I had a piece
of celery stuck in my throat.

724
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:49,751
Well, you know, I admit
it. I like to play.

725
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:52,995
But, after I get me a
couple of more dealerships,

726
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:56,761
I will be King of the South,
who will need his Queen.

727
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,165
Well, my king
has a surprise.

728
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:08,742
RJ's having a professional camera
crew film the anniversary banquet!

729
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,108
Tell them, honey!
Go ahead!

730
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:18,181
Like my baby said, it was
supposed to be a surprise.

731
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:24,524
A gift, really. You know, no big deal.
Just a little something special for y'all.

732
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,187
That's so sweet.

733
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:28,993
Wait a minute. Hold up. Nigga,
you got some cameras hidden around?

734
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,465
You done brought some
cameras? Reggie...

735
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:34,163
You got that shit hidden around
here? Oh, y'all seen his show.

736
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:36,729
Roscoe be jumping out of
bushes on little midgets.

737
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:38,206
Midgets?

738
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:42,268
Neglected albino children.
Al-Qaeda leaders.

739
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:47,278
Rice, chicken kebab,
chicken falafel...

740
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:51,151
Boy, you crazy.
I'm telling you,

741
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,417
<i>they be scattering
like roaches, like Cops.</i>

742
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:56,289
You gonna win a Emmy,
and I'm voting for you.

743
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:01,593
Remember, son, this is a family
celebration, not some Hollywood production.

744
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:03,866
Yes, sir.

745
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:06,232
Oh, hell, it'll be
all right, Papa J.

746
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:09,301
I'm sure old Roscoe
gonna do the right thing.

747
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:13,139
I'm just glad to see your baby boy
back gracing us with his presence.

748
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,336
You done good, 'Scoe.

749
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:19,816
You got a outstanding career,
beautiful fiancee, great son.

750
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,449
You finally winning, man.

751
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,751
Don't even matter that you
could never beat me at nothing.

752
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,782
Oh, shit!
That's the button.

753
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,724
What you trying
to do, Clyde?

754
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:34,427
I'm trying my best
to be a better man

755
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:37,558
and you trying to drag me
into a penis-swinging contest?

756
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,603
Oh, my goodness. That
definitely ain't no contest.

757
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:47,706
You a sad man, Clyde. Your
competitive edge imprisons you.

758
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:52,877
Feel good for what you've
done, not for what you haven't.

759
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:57,715
The one loss you suffered at my
hands is still a burden to you.

760
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,416
Get over it. I have.

761
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:03,422
That's the "Team of Me. "

762
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:09,828
That's right, baby.

763
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,889
Oh.

764
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:16,496
And just for the record, I'll
beat you again. And worse.

765
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:19,172
Is that right?

766
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:22,041
Care to make it interesting?
Little wager, perhaps?

767
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:26,412
For what? You'd just find a
way to renege again, renigga.

768
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,610
Oh, shit.

769
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:29,209
I ain't never
reneged on no bet.

770
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:30,378
You a damn liar!

771
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,786
Oh, this is getting hot!

772
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,825
You know damn well what
the hell I'm talking about.

773
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:39,090
You're a sore loser,
and you stole what was mine.

774
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:53,168
Lemonade is
good, Mama.

775
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:58,945
There it is. That bitch
done made you tough, Roscoe.

776
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:03,544
You hungry as shit, but that
bitch done made you tough!

777
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:07,918
What is
wrong with you?

778
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:11,120
I can't believe you're still
pining after the prom queen.

779
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,186
We only said three
words to each other!

780
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:14,492
Forty words.

781
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:17,893
And that Clyde, he's
a smug son of a bitch.

782
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:21,631
No wonder he's a car salesman.
He's slick and unethical.

783
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,875
Why the hell did you tell
everybody about the camera crew?

784
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:27,240
They were gonna
see them anyway.

785
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:30,644
And besides, we were losing
ground. I had to make a move.

786
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,148
<i>Bianca, this is
not Survivor!</i>

787
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:35,751
Oh, yes, it is.

788
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:39,755
Look, baby, baby,
baby. Listen. Listen.

789
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:44,623
Let's not fight, okay? I'm sorry.

790
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:47,994
Lucinda was just a
crush, but I moved on.

791
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,565
So you're over her?

792
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:53,796
How can I not be,
with you as my lady?

793
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:04,139
Yeah, that's what I'm
talking about. Yeah!

794
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:09,681
Oh, baby. All the time I spent here,
I never got a little piece of nothing.

795
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:14,451
No way. These walls
are way too thin.

796
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:16,925
And plus,
your family listens.

797
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,723
That's ridiculous!

798
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:21,961
Look, now, I want
to speak in tongues.

799
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:25,498
Nope. Forget it.

800
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:27,726
Damn!

801
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:36,603
Think you so damn special.

802
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,083
I sent a plasma, you
bought cake. Negro, please!

803
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:43,881
Hey, Roscoe, I didn't
know you were still up.

804
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,353
Hey, Lucinda,
how you doing?

805
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:46,821
I'm great.

806
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,152
Who you talking to?

807
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:49,283
Nobody.

808
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:55,060
Well, actually, myself. I do that.
You know, just practicing for the show.

809
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,396
You know, keep it fresh, you know?

810
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,437
Okay, I see. Can you take a break?

811
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:08,671
Damn!

812
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,838
This cake is scrumptious.

813
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:13,041
I knew
you'd like it.

814
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:15,415
So, you said your
publicist introduced you?

815
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,922
Yeah. Well, yeah.

816
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:22,550
We... We had her on
the show after she won.

817
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:26,555
And... We just sort
of connected, you know?

818
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,461
So how does she
and Jamaal get along?

819
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:29,590
Real good.

820
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,158
You know, she got him eating right.

821
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,228
Maternal stuff.

822
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:35,464
He's a great kid.

823
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:37,062
Oh, thank you.

824
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,371
So, you and Clyde?

825
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:46,340
No. He was a familiar face
when I moved to Atlanta.

826
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:49,147
He's sweet, but your
cousin's a player.

827
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,746
What happened to your
engagement? Wasn't there some guy?

828
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:55,121
Are you keeping tabs
on me, Roscoe Jenkins?

829
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:58,628
Well, no, no, I heard things.
You know... Look at my ears.

830
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,426
You know, I heard... I heard
it. You know I heard it.

831
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:02,988
You stupid.

832
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:06,596
What did you hear? Huh?

833
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:09,503
That I went to school
to find a husband, right?

834
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:12,872
See? Yeah, I did.
I got engaged early.

835
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:17,076
I had the vision of having
a two-income household,

836
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:21,514
three kids before 30, Sunday
brunch with my homegirls...

837
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,384
Sounds good to me.

838
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:24,614
Don't it, though?

839
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:31,057
But the student loans never go away,
you're still broke after grad school,

840
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:34,257
and he didn't want kids.

841
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:37,092
Ever.

842
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,294
So... Dream deferred.

843
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,437
I feel you.

844
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:47,105
Me and Jamaal's mom
was a disaster.

845
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:52,848
I wasn't ready to be a parent,
either. But he's my son.

846
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:56,649
Spoken like a true Jenkins man.

847
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:06,961
You need to
finish that cake.

848
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:08,395
Shit.

849
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:10,831
'Cause if I don't watch
this figure, who will?

850
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:12,960
I could think of
some takers.

851
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:17,370
Me, too! Sign me up
for that booty duty!

852
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,501
Hey, Reggie. We were
just saying good night.

853
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:22,909
Hell, no, don't let me
interrupt. Don't let me interrupt.

854
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,504
Don't let him interrupt.

855
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,776
Oh, no, no,
no. It's okay.

856
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:31,116
I need to go home and see my parents,
and I'll talk to you guys tomorrow. Okay?

857
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,987
Good night.
Good night.

858
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:46,460
Tell the truth. You
got a woody, don't you?

859
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:49,195
Fool, if I had a woody,
I'd flip this table over.

860
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,967
We was just catching up.

861
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:55,571
Your daddy don't want that plasma you
bought. I'll just tell you that right now.

862
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:59,138
And it's a damn shame that it's
just going to waste like that.

863
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:03,248
Just a TV, just sitting there,
ain't gonna do nothing, man, is...

864
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,311
There's so many poor people
down here that need...

865
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:07,584
Would you like that...
That plasma, Reggie?

866
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,683
I... Boy, I ain't lying.
I could use it.

867
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,057
Well, would you
like to have it?

868
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:14,427
Yeah! I'm gonna get it and freak
it. I'm gonna have it right.

869
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,193
Not gonna happen.

870
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:18,291
Just tight. That's just...

871
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:23,065
Hey, Lone Ranger,
it's time to saddle up.

872
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:24,963
Uh-oh.

873
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,304
Gotta go.

874
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:29,903
Hi-yo, Silver!
Off to the ATM machine!

875
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,850
Giddy-up! Yes.

876
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,385
Giddy-up!

877
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:43,019
It's gonna be a long weekend.

878
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,564
Excuse me.

879
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:33,901
Excuse.

880
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,941
Baby, my Downward Dog is fine.

881
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:40,278
Your alignment's off.

882
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:42,450
Watch me.

883
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:51,487
Damn, you are flexible!

884
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,085
Good morning, Reggie.

885
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:54,596
Good morning to you!

886
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:55,859
What's up, 'Scoe?

887
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,400
Fuck you looking at, Reggie?

888
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:00,027
You wanna glue your eyes
back into your head, now?

889
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:03,698
Oh, my fault. I didn't mean to look, but
I was just checking out the pose, man.

890
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,140
Hey! That is nice. That's
hot. That is so hot.

891
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:08,302
Can I help you with
something, Reggie?

892
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:09,367
Oh, your bag is here.

893
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,471
You couldn't just say
that from Jump Street.

894
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:13,743
I was distracted, 'cause it looked
like somebody hit you in the face

895
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:15,182
with a sack of nickels.

896
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:17,777
Well, maybe a foot in your
ass'll help you focus, huh?

897
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:21,119
Maybe a slice of red velvet
cake'll help you focus.

898
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:30,293
Man, get your look
and move on. One look.

899
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,664
and down.

900
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:36,228
That's it. One. One!

901
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,773
One more, one more, one time.

902
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:39,832
That's it. Move on!

903
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,935
Oh, my God.
Damn, 'Scoe!

904
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:43,240
<i>Namaste.</i>

905
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:45,714
Oh! Hey.

906
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,545
Reggie's got a Frank
Aaron jersey, too, baby.

907
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:51,951
That's Hank, baby. And
mine is a limited edition.

908
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:54,320
Reggie wouldn't even know
where to look for one.

909
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:55,722
Oh, it's your
world, player.

910
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:59,353
I'm just a squirrel trying to get
a nut, if you know what I mean.

911
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:01,521
Mmm.

912
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:05,591
Man, you need to get her pregnant
soon. Come on, Bucky, let's go.

913
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,369
My God.
Did you see that?

914
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:19,509
Yeah.

915
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,178
That's my jersey,
ain't it?

916
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,318
Come on, Jamaal.

917
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,482
I don't think I'm
cut out for softball.

918
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:29,320
Don't be such a girl about it.

919
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:33,590
Jamaal, forget all that.
You a natural.

920
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:36,962
Plus, this was your
dad's sport. All right?

921
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:41,368
The main thing is to relax and
keep cool. Just like your dad.

922
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:44,473
Come on, we got them, we got them!
We got them, come on, we got them!

923
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,667
We got them!

924
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:47,972
You out, sucka!
Damn it!

925
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,103
Good throw, Betty!

926
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:51,613
How could this fool
steal everything but third?

927
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:55,981
'Cause I got a cannon in this arm,
boy! A-Rod ain't stealing on me.

928
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,078
Damn, I'm a thief. I don't
never get caught stealing.

929
00:50:58,155 --> 00:51:00,316
Can't steal third,
brother, not around here.

930
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,857
My shirt!
Go home, man.

931
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:04,860
Yeah, my fault. This
ain't authentic, is it?

932
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:09,599
Where does that child think she is?

933
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:10,690
I don't know.

934
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:14,225
But I bet that come with
paint remover. Good God!

935
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:17,001
Jamaal! Widen
your stance, son.

936
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,304
Keep your eye on the ball.
Choke up on the bat.

937
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:20,842
Focus.
Okay.

938
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,003
Do what your father told you, okay?

939
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,015
Now, don't be scared of
Callie. I know she's big.

940
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:29,116
We all big. That's
why you in question.

941
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:30,517
Jamaal! Focus.

942
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,446
All right, it's 0 and
2. Come on, Jamaal.

943
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:36,249
Strike three!

944
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:37,520
That's all right,
baby.

945
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:40,429
That's a good try.
God, this kid's pathetic!

946
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:42,021
You're making
Grandma proud.

947
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,327
Good try, Jamaal.

948
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,867
No, no,
it wasn't, Daddy.

949
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:47,528
Now, what is he, Roscoe?
One of them meatless people?

950
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,435
Is he one of them vegans
or vogans, whatever?

951
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:52,202
You need to feed that child,
Roscoe, that's what's wrong with him!

952
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:55,733
You ain't giving
him enough...

953
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:56,972
Good one, Callie!

954
00:51:57,047 --> 00:52:00,039
Can't understand nothing.
He's dumb in the brain.

955
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,316
Come on, Roscoe!
Hit one for Mama!

956
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,118
All I need you to
do is make contact.

957
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:09,249
I got this.

958
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:11,817
You got a strikeout a-coming
if you ain't careful.

959
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:15,456
"Youse got a strikeout coming
if you ain't careful.

960
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:17,261
"Boy, youse gonna... "

961
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:20,727
Y'all don't take the smile for
a weakness all the time, okay?

962
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:21,862
I've never
thought that.

963
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:22,962
Y'all think I'm weak or something.

964
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:24,131
No, I don't
think you weak.

965
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:27,005
Okay. Don't. Okay.
I thought you was Uncle Ben.

966
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:28,733
Hey.

967
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:31,340
Take a seat. Let me
get this, right here.

968
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:35,507
All right. That's what I'm talking 'bout,
now! Let the games begin! Come on, baby!

969
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:38,718
What the hell you
think you doing, Clyde?

970
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:40,915
I'm about to strike
you out, player!

971
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,551
I've got a narrow strike zone, boy.

972
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:44,821
Oh, that's all right, Papa J.

973
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:47,864
Anything wider than Roscoe
head would be unfair.

974
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:51,096
Everybody sit down.
Have a seat.

975
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,467
Take a load off. Get
comfortable. Don't worry about it.

976
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:57,735
Bring the La-Z-Boys out here
or something. Come on, boy.

977
00:52:57,807 --> 00:52:59,707
I got this, right here.

978
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,240
What's up, 'Scoe?
You ready?

979
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:05,679
You want to be in the big
time? Here we go, yeah.

980
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:07,512
Right here, baby!

981
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:09,407
Strike!

982
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:14,348
That's better than air
conditioning right there, boy.

983
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:17,689
Feel that breeze?

984
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:19,820
Come on, Roscoe!

985
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:24,194
They just talking smack,
baby. You can do it, baby!

986
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:26,667
Focus, RJ!
Come on. Get a hit!

987
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,631
"Focus, RJ!"

988
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:36,078
All right, everybody good? Betty,
all right, give me a little something.

989
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:37,571
Okay.

990
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:46,184
Okay, I got you. Good to go.
All right, cool, cool, cool.

991
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:49,349
Right here.

992
00:53:57,434 --> 00:53:59,095
Crush it! Kill it!

993
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,666
You hit my mama!
Mama!

994
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,141
Oh, my God!
- Oh, no, no!

995
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:08,438
Mama J!

996
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:09,603
Oh, Jesus.

997
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:13,882
That done knocked the wig
off and everything. Damn!

998
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,010
Hey, get off me
about it right now.

999
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,852
Oh, really? Get off you about it?
- That's right.

1000
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,324
Yeah, okay? Stop
sweating me about it.

1001
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:25,054
But I was trying to tell you
to wait on the flutterball.

1002
00:54:25,128 --> 00:54:27,289
<i>You up there swinging like
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,</i>

1003
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:29,889
now my mama got a
red titty on her head!

1004
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:31,126
She's my mama, too, O.

1005
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:33,499
We don't know that.
You could be adopted.

1006
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:37,173
Look, I gotta get the fish. Meet
me at Monty's. Can you do that?

1007
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:44,603
Mama, I'm sorry.
Really sorry, Mama.

1008
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:47,650
I know, baby.
Mama'll be all right.

1009
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:50,845
Heck, Mama, I was trying to hit it out the
park. I didn't know it was going that way.

1010
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,115
I'm getting my headache,
baby. Be quiet.

1011
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:55,316
Daddy...

1012
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:57,553
Son, we all make mistakes.

1013
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:59,861
We just have
to learn from them.

1014
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:05,360
Though I don't know what you learn
by giving your mama a concussion.

1015
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,605
Hey, Big O!

1016
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,673
I don't know how you
take it down here, O.

1017
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:17,504
Man, you was the best
linebacker in the state.

1018
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:20,048
If it wasn't for your
knee injury, shoot!

1019
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:24,951
Man, you'd be in the NFL, living
in a mansion, driving a Benz.

1020
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:28,347
Yeah, that's good, man. But, you
know, it wasn't in God's plans for me.

1021
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:31,655
God's plan is cool,
but you needed the "Me" plan.

1022
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:36,028
Oh, man, stop talking that bullshit.
I ain't no failure. I'm a king.

1023
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:37,396
I got a great family,

1024
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:40,925
I live in a great community that
I love and that loves me back.

1025
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:41,993
You the failure.

1026
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:43,539
How do you
figure that?

1027
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,031
I made it.

1028
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:47,872
Oh, why? 'Cause you got
some money? 'Cause you on TV?

1029
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:49,377
What else you got
to show for it?

1030
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:51,380
Everything I ain't
have growing up.

1031
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:54,212
What you ain't have
that was that important?

1032
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:57,119
Hey, why don't Jamaal know
how to play baseball?

1033
00:55:57,487 --> 00:56:00,149
You used to love to play,
and you was halfway decent.

1034
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:04,626
Man, I ain't got time for all that.
Besides, Jamaal only loves soccer.

1035
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:08,757
I think Jamaal would love whatever
sport his father showed interest in.

1036
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:11,460
Oh, so you a parenting
expert, now?

1037
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:16,866
Man, all I'm saying is don't
let money raise your kids.

1038
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,738
Well, don't let cornbread
and chitlins raise yours.

1039
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,503
What you looking
at me like that for, O?

1040
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:26,509
Yeah, I said it.
Why you approaching me?

1041
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,013
I just didn't hear you.

1042
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:29,449
I said what you looking
at me like that for?

1043
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:30,781
Ain't nobody
scared of you.

1044
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:32,287
What'd you say before that?

1045
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:33,548
Don't let what?

1046
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:36,285
Don't let chitlins,
cornbread, ham hocks,

1047
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:39,122
cheese sticks or none
of that raise your kids.

1048
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:43,461
That's what I said. What, you got
hostility? What, what... What's happening?

1049
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:46,525
This ain't your little brother
no more, O. I'm a grown man.

1050
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:48,627
You know, I don't get ass
whoopings, I give 'em out.

1051
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:49,729
Mmm-hmm?

1052
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:52,434
You a officer
here in Mayberry.

1053
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:55,410
Come on... What you carry?
A flashlight and a baton?

1054
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:58,003
A'ight. Tell you what. Maybe...

1055
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:01,945
If you a good old boy,
I hire you as my security.

1056
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:03,918
Yeah, I got the pull. I can do it.

1057
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:05,815
Big-ass...

1058
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:15,461
Now you and Mama got matching
titties. Maybe y'all are related.

1059
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:42,054
You know, you should do a show
about scrawny little brothers

1060
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:46,528
that constantly get bitched.
Look at your head!

1061
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:51,225
Yeah, but... Thank you. But my
next show gonna be about prison hoes

1062
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:55,804
who mask conjugal visits
as Bible readings.

1063
00:57:55,872 --> 00:58:00,866
Yeah, it's gonna be called
"Bible Thumpers or Bible Humpers?"

1064
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:02,434
You available?

1065
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,948
You got time?

1066
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:10,877
What you feeling?

1067
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:15,714
Oh. Oh, okay. You better get your
Butterfinger-eating ass back in the car.

1068
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:18,090
I may not hit a woman,
but I'll beat a bitch's ass.

1069
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,423
Oh, is that what
you gonna do? Yeah.

1070
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:20,554
That's what you gonna do?
What?

1071
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,097
You gonna beat a bitch's ass?
Oh... Oh...

1072
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,757
What bitch you gonna beat, 'Scoe?

1073
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,926
What bitch you gonna beat, huh,
'Scoe? That's what it's like?

1074
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,026
Is that what it's like?
Hold up.

1075
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:28,434
What bitch you
gonna beat, 'Scoe?

1076
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:32,140
You snapped my neck, little... Look
out! You didn't know. Golden glove.

1077
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:34,802
Watch. I'm gonna give you a
dirty, South-ass whipping, boy!

1078
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:38,075
Come on, come on! Bring it back! Bring
it back, punk! Come on, bring it on back!

1079
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:40,710
Oh!

1080
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:43,684
Roscoe, get your damn...
Get off of me, 'Scoe!

1081
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:48,157
That ain't weave, fool!
You gonna be sorry!

1082
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:55,420
Wait a minute! You done pulled out
my damn tracks! What you gonna do, RJ?

1083
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:59,559
I'm sick of you! I'm sick! Say you
sorry. Say uncle. Say uncle! Say uncle!

1084
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:03,595
Say it! Talk your shit
now, you fake-ass Bruce Lee!

1085
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:05,270
You wanna get up?
You wanna get up?

1086
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:09,107
Come on, come on. I done
told you about your mouth!

1087
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:11,878
I am not a ho!

1088
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:15,178
I am doing God's work!
Say, "Praise the Lord!"

1089
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:22,748
Now I'm gonna tell you something. You'd
better be glad I'm a good Christian,

1090
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:26,123
'cause the next time
I might not be so merciful.

1091
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:29,255
You done made me lose
my protection from the Lord.

1092
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:32,631
Father God, forgive him,
for he know not what he do.

1093
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:35,734
I'm gonna pray for you, Roscoe.

1094
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:39,071
Thank you, I...

1095
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:02,030
Hey, Lucinda.

1096
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:04,532
Oh, my God!
Roscoe, are you okay?

1097
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:06,992
What do you mean?

1098
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:10,039
Well, your face looks like
you got run over by a tractor.

1099
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,666
Really? I feel fine.

1100
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:15,142
Well, it looks
terrible. Here, sit.

1101
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,982
Oh, my God.

1102
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:24,578
Here.

1103
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:28,848
That feels good.

1104
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:32,060
Good, good.

1105
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:36,765
Hey, it might be a good idea
to stop teasing everybody.

1106
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:39,993
This is nothing.

1107
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:42,064
Why you trying
to front?

1108
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,298
I'm not fronting.

1109
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:48,608
See? See? You know you're hurting.

1110
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:53,844
The Roscoe Jenkins I knew
would've owned up to it.

1111
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:57,883
Well, this is RJ Stevens
you're tending to now, girl.

1112
01:00:57,954 --> 01:01:01,617
Yeah, the new and
improved Roscoe 7.0.

1113
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:08,029
I think Roscoe 1.0
was just fine.

1114
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:16,603
Oh!

1115
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:17,731
I didn't know you were back.

1116
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:20,207
We weren't doing nothing!

1117
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:24,010
Nothing much, that is.

1118
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:31,013
Well, good. Why don't you
give me a hand, Roscoe?

1119
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:33,285
Papa J, I thought
you wanted me to help.

1120
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,950
No, that's all right.
Roscoe's got this.

1121
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:38,721
Yeah, I got this.

1122
01:01:56,713 --> 01:02:00,581
Son, you are ready to
get married, aren't you?

1123
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:06,819
Of course! Yeah.
Why do you ask?

1124
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:10,324
Well, if I didn't know any better,

1125
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:13,453
I'd think there's something
going on between you and Lucinda.

1126
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:16,965
Oh, no! I'm just, you know...

1127
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,734
We're just catching up.

1128
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:23,530
Daddy, the wedding
is gonna be hot.

1129
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:27,299
Got the caterer,
R. Kelly's singing...

1130
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:30,771
Beyonce is gonna choreograph
the Electric Slide.

1131
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,078
Roscoe, I think you
know what I'm saying.

1132
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:38,813
The marriage isn't
about the wedding day.

1133
01:02:38,888 --> 01:02:42,085
Your mama and I got married
right out there in the front yard.

1134
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:46,492
I know, but... Well, Bianca wants
a big wedding with all the trimmings.

1135
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,695
Is that what you want?

1136
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,868
Yeah, I... I think.

1137
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,766
I do. I do.

1138
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:02,408
How does Jamaal
feel about that?

1139
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:05,808
Jamaal, he... Jamaal's cool, Daddy.

1140
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:10,542
Be mindful of that boy.
He never sees his own mother.

1141
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:15,379
From what he tells me, he
doesn't see much of you, either.

1142
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:19,986
I'm trying, Daddy. All right?
But the show keeps me so busy...

1143
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:26,398
<i>The show. Team of Me.
I never quite understood that.</i>

1144
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:32,767
Well, it's... It's just a saying, you
know? Protect yourself. Be your own man.

1145
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:35,271
Well, that's fine, son, but...

1146
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:39,246
There are times you gotta depend
on others, family and friends.

1147
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:42,349
I mean, you never learned
anything like that around here.

1148
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:45,785
And that's certainly not
something you teach a child.

1149
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:52,455
Some kids learn it
on their own, Daddy.

1150
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:22,615
Honey! I've been busy with a
personal project all morning

1151
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:26,628
and I'm exhausted, so... Be
a dear and walk Fifi for me?

1152
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:31,524
Come on, baby. Let Feef
run around and enjoy nature.

1153
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:34,192
I was hoping
to get a little nap.

1154
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:35,396
Aw.

1155
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:38,368
My little man is tired.

1156
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:45,910
Well, I promise I'll do any little thing
you want if you do this little thing for me.

1157
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,785
Plus, I want to show you
my little project.

1158
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:56,725
What project?

1159
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:00,589
Damn!

1160
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,394
Are those my initials?

1161
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:07,095
Mmm-hmm.

1162
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,561
I told you it was yours.

1163
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,840
You're a hell
of an artist, baby.

1164
01:05:15,878 --> 01:05:17,368
Come on, Feef!

1165
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:23,749
Come on, Feef, go pee.

1166
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:30,455
Oh, shit! Snake!
Feef! Come on, Feef!

1167
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:34,425
Run, Fifi! Run!
Come on!

1168
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,756
Come on! Hey! Lucinda...
Hey, what's the matter?

1169
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:41,030
Don't go down there. Fifi's cornered
by this big-ass poisonous snake.

1170
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,331
And you left her?

1171
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:44,305
No! Lucinda!
Save yourself!

1172
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:51,406
You see? I'm sorry, Fifi!

1173
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:54,510
I ain't sucking out no...
No poison!

1174
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:59,045
You okay, girl? Yeah? You
just got a little scare, huh?

1175
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:01,780
Fifi...

1176
01:06:01,857 --> 01:06:03,188
It's okay.
It's all right.

1177
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:05,123
She all right?
Yeah.

1178
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:07,525
Here you go. See? It was
just a little milk snake.

1179
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:14,094
Now, that wasn't the snake I saw.
It was an anaconda or a python.

1180
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:16,468
Well, we don't
have those down here.

1181
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:17,767
For real?
Uh-huh.

1182
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:20,565
There you go.

1183
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:25,180
You want to take a walk?

1184
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:27,407
Sure.

1185
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:30,416
You out here running off
that red velvet cake, huh?

1186
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:31,544
I deserve some cake.

1187
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:33,087
Yeah, no...

1188
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:38,683
Oh, come on, you heard the stories.
Hell, you witnessed a bunch.

1189
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:43,323
Everybody did everything better than
me. So, I found something I'm good at.

1190
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:46,729
I get in front of that
audience and they feel me.

1191
01:06:47,803 --> 01:06:49,771
More than anyone
here ever did.

1192
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,706
Please, Roscoe. What family
doesn't mess with one another?

1193
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:55,971
I mean, I got teased to no
end about my skinny legs.

1194
01:06:56,045 --> 01:06:57,307
Yeah, well, you do
have some slim-jims.

1195
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:58,472
Oh, shut up!

1196
01:06:58,547 --> 01:06:59,741
You could pick your
teeth with those legs.

1197
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:02,181
Shut up.

1198
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:07,416
See? You can dish it out, boy.
Especially when it comes to Clyde.

1199
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:09,481
Clyde.

1200
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:12,789
Clyde's big-headed ass needs to be
knocked off his high horse sometimes.

1201
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:15,295
Why are you two always
digging at each other?

1202
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:19,824
Because Clyde is dirty, and will
use any underhanded trick to win.

1203
01:07:19,902 --> 01:07:21,529
Aren't you exaggerating
just a little?

1204
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:22,798
No.

1205
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:27,065
And what was all that "you
stole what was mine" business?

1206
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:29,543
At the picnic.
What did he steal?

1207
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:36,814
A great opportunity.

1208
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:45,625
Well, if it was that great, why
can't you create another one?

1209
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:50,698
Maybe I will.

1210
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:54,429
Maybe you should.

1211
01:07:56,105 --> 01:08:00,201
Well, well, well.
Here y'all are again!

1212
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:07,840
Caught you, didn't I?
Mamma gonna get ya...

1213
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,885
This raises
some eyebrows.

1214
01:08:09,952 --> 01:08:13,149
Well, sing like a canary,
Reggie. Whistle.

1215
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:19,192
All that with the birds. Harmonize with
'em. But you're not getting the plasma.

1216
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:21,956
I was walking the dog.

1217
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:24,556
How's that?
Bucky's with us.

1218
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:28,597
I'm talking about Fiona.
Where is Feef?

1219
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:31,503
Oh, I think she's
down by the gully.

1220
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:32,666
Where's Bucky?

1221
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:34,402
Down by the gully.

1222
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:39,147
He's gonna tear it up.

1223
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:43,908
Bucky, get your ass off!

1224
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:46,712
Oh, my God.

1225
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:51,755
She is so working him.

1226
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:59,463
Don't be surprised if he
starts barking in tongues.

1227
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:09,175
Bucky done
turned the bitch out.

1228
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:26,225
Reg, not a word.

1229
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:27,660
I got you.

1230
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:30,130
Is that plasma TV
under warranty?

1231
01:09:32,034 --> 01:09:33,365
Mmm.

1232
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:36,996
I'm a steel trap, player.
That dog gonna need counseling.

1233
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:43,306
You gonna be all right?

1234
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:44,744
Maybe she won't notice.

1235
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:53,781
Oh, baby, me and Fifi
had so much fun out there,

1236
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:56,216
we completely
lost track of time.

1237
01:09:56,292 --> 01:10:00,490
Yeah, Daddy loves himself some
Fifi. Isn't that right, Fifi?

1238
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:05,931
Daddy loves his little Fifi! Yeah! Oh,
we was running all over the place, baby.

1239
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:11,029
Yeah, she may need a bath.
She got dirty. Real dirty.

1240
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:13,765
Now see here, buster.

1241
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:17,300
Your alliance is with me,
not the prom queen.

1242
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:21,543
Oh, come on, baby. There's
no other alliance. All right?

1243
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:26,010
Now how about you show me
that little project?

1244
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:28,347
I shaved off
my little project.

1245
01:10:28,424 --> 01:10:29,618
Why'd you do that?

1246
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:34,361
If I discover there's a mutiny afoot,
I'm gonna shave off your little project.

1247
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:35,795
Understand?

1248
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:40,560
Damn!

1249
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:43,136
Damn!
Damn!

1250
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:45,871
<i>One timer! Kaberle.</i>

1251
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:47,135
Goal!

1252
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:52,280
Dang, you got game,
nephew. It's all right.

1253
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:54,544
Hey, Dad!

1254
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,814
Roscoe Malley!
What's up, man?

1255
01:10:58,387 --> 01:11:02,619
So I heard you been running around
with my girl again. Come on, man.

1256
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:05,550
Let's play the game. Me and
Junior take on you and Jamaal.

1257
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:06,652
Yeah.

1258
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:08,219
I don't play
children's games.

1259
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:12,694
Oh, is that right? Then
what's your poison, brother?

1260
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:17,363
Ya hear that, though.
You like that, eh?

1261
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:20,704
Yeah, I've been dying to play
a little click-clack.

1262
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:23,976
Sure you want to
take it there, Clyde?

1263
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,441
'Cause I don't play for fun.

1264
01:11:26,515 --> 01:11:28,506
Ain't no fun losing money.

1265
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:31,613
Then you're about
to have a bad time.

1266
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:36,424
Seven! Oh, that's gonna
be all day right there!

1267
01:11:36,492 --> 01:11:38,255
Can you handle it?
Money maker! Money maker!

1268
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:40,488
Daddy needs
a new pair of gators.

1269
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:41,688
Watch this right there.

1270
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:43,959
Talking about shake 'em up,
shake 'em up, wake 'em.

1271
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:45,057
Oh!

1272
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,328
Yeah, Dad!

1273
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:47,960
Daddy, yes!

1274
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:49,868
You know what, man?
I admire you.

1275
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:51,735
Yeah?
I admire you, Roscoe.

1276
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:58,610
I mean, you still keep trying. You
know, 'cause even when I lose, I win.

1277
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:00,041
Ooh.
Ooh.

1278
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:02,345
Well, then this must feel like
the championship,

1279
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:05,444
'cause you're losing
the grip. Bitch!

1280
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:11,490
Right there.
Come on, baby, eat for Mama.

1281
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:14,421
Binata?

1282
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:18,330
You're not listening. Now, I told you
to take that dog out of my kitchen.

1283
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,960
It just ain't sanitary!
What's wrong with people?

1284
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:24,904
Bringing damn dogs up in folks'
kitchen? Don't make no damn sense.

1285
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:31,135
That ain't nothing, you ain't even
slick with yours, so that's the problem.

1286
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:35,172
Everybody see what you're
doing, man. But she mine, bro.

1287
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:39,744
Yeah? Well, you might want to tell her
that, 'cause she's feeling a brother.

1288
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:41,756
Seven again!

1289
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:43,848
All right, grease is
hot, I need that fish.

1290
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:44,950
Here you go, baby.

1291
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,052
Thank you.

1292
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:48,619
Mmm.

1293
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:50,426
It's a little sweet,
but it's delicious.

1294
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:54,263
Yes! And that wine of yours,
baby, set it right off!

1295
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:56,595
The '67 Margaux?
Yeah!

1296
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:58,367
That's a $600 bottle!

1297
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,067
And worth every penny!

1298
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:01,870
Oh!

1299
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:04,969
Seven again!

1300
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,776
Oh!

1301
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:09,511
Somebody stop it!

1302
01:13:11,253 --> 01:13:12,550
Come on, roll the dice, man.

1303
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:14,316
Oh, I get it. That's
mine, that's mine.

1304
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,516
Pass on that ass.

1305
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:17,320
Oh!
- Oh!

1306
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:18,621
Could it be?

1307
01:13:18,694 --> 01:13:19,786
No, no, no, no.

1308
01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:21,329
I call gator
on that right there.

1309
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:22,958
Nigga, this ain't Monopoly.

1310
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:25,591
Hey, hey, man!
Roll again, bro.

1311
01:13:27,436 --> 01:13:30,530
Clyde, you better un-ass me before
you find yourself a pinky short.

1312
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:34,201
You better roll again before you
find yourself an artery short.

1313
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:39,610
You brought it on yourself! You
brought it on yourself, Clyde!

1314
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:41,706
Let's go get some fish.
Okay. Come on, Jamaal.

1315
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:45,379
Is this what you wanted,
Clyde? That's what you want.

1316
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:48,685
That's right! That's right! That's
Junior Varsity right there, bro!

1317
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:53,083
Feel that?

1318
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:55,062
Oh, that's your
ass right there!

1319
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:00,098
Wait, wait, stop!

1320
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:02,262
Y'all better stop all that
running through my kitchen!

1321
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:04,404
Got you! Yeah!

1322
01:14:04,506 --> 01:14:07,566
You broke Daddy's table!
We worked hard on this!

1323
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:11,638
That's 'cause you fixed it!

1324
01:14:20,055 --> 01:14:22,421
I said, why are you drinking
when you're pregnant?

1325
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:24,186
Well, they said I could
have a glass of wine.

1326
01:14:24,259 --> 01:14:25,317
Really?

1327
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:27,760
They didn't say how many times
you could refill it, though, baby.

1328
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,263
I want to be pregnant!

1329
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:30,355
How about another one?

1330
01:14:30,432 --> 01:14:31,729
Let's do it, Balolo.

1331
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,127
Clyde-o-mania, baby!

1332
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:41,004
You ended up with a big dog now, boy.
You ought to check my dental records.

1333
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:46,371
Lord, these fools
been playing dice.

1334
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:48,572
Hey, knock it off!

1335
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:51,551
Ladies, get the tartar sauce
and the hot sauce,

1336
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:54,020
'cause the Jenkins family is
about to throw down!

1337
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:01,856
Man,
what are y'all doing?

1338
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:03,591
Stop that...

1339
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:08,802
RJ, no!

1340
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:09,963
It's hot! It's hot!

1341
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:15,737
Oh, hell no!

1342
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:16,971
Oh, my God.

1343
01:15:18,213 --> 01:15:19,680
Are you okay?

1344
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:25,510
Oh, my God.

1345
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:27,555
He started it.
He started it.

1346
01:15:27,623 --> 01:15:30,888
<i>What they heading for now
What they heading for now...</i>

1347
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:33,928
Damn! Poor Mama.

1348
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:39,093
You should have had more
prenatal care. Look at your kids.

1349
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:42,167
I'm sorry.

1350
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:47,132
Baby, I'm sorry.

1351
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:49,601
It was an accident.

1352
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:51,168
Silence,
shower, strategy.

1353
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:52,338
That's all
I need right now.

1354
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:57,946
Boy, the shower is all yours.

1355
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:02,484
You used all my shit!

1356
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:03,684
Yeah, what?

1357
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:04,851
And you're wearing my robe?

1358
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:06,360
What...
Now, you little...

1359
01:16:06,428 --> 01:16:10,558
Bianca, how's Fiona doing? She
still spooked by that snake?

1360
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:12,660
What snake?

1361
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:14,861
The snake Lucinda
saved Fifi from.

1362
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:20,338
I mean, she seems pretty
relaxed. That's probably 'cause...

1363
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,070
Satellite!
Huh, 'Scoe?

1364
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:25,739
Satellite, pay-per-view, premium
channels, sports channels,

1365
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:27,839
platinum titty channels...
All that, man.

1366
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:29,042
<i>Playboy channels?</i>

1367
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:31,745
Yeah, butt-naked channels.
You like butt-naked?

1368
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,082
Oh, I got to have it.

1369
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:36,454
You like when they
butt-naked, showing all ass?

1370
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:38,692
You know it.
Gospel channels?

1371
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,625
Yeah, you...
Gospel, all that!

1372
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:42,492
Telemundo?
You like Telemundo?

1373
01:16:42,564 --> 01:16:44,088
I like... I like Spanish.

1374
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:45,690
All that!

1375
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:46,791
All the...

1376
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:51,195
My man. Peace.

1377
01:16:57,446 --> 01:17:00,779
I don't know who you are
anymore, Roscoe Jenkins.

1378
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:03,074
Baby, it's me.

1379
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:05,680
It's RJ.

1380
01:17:05,754 --> 01:17:10,885
Are you really willing to put your career,
your future, in jeopardy over a crush?

1381
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:14,224
Career? Baby,
we're getting married.

1382
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:19,062
Get your priorities in order and
decide what and who you really want.

1383
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:23,136
Let that simmer while you
sleep on the couch tonight.

1384
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:25,639
We're going to
take a shower.

1385
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,365
Reggie!
Hell, no!

1386
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:54,993
Get your nasty ass outta here!

1387
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:57,197
I didn't know that was you.
You knew I was in here!

1388
01:17:57,305 --> 01:17:59,500
You is a nasty common freak!

1389
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:02,304
There is a naked linebacker
in our shower right now.

1390
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:04,345
Now, you done brought that
little white gal up in here,

1391
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:06,176
now you trying to sneak around
and see some black meat?

1392
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:08,648
Girl, ain't no... I didn't try
to come here and look at you!

1393
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:10,207
Well, then hand me
my feminine wash!

1394
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:13,083
I can see why you
can't keep a man, now.

1395
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:16,352
You got to lay off them Milky Ways
and Doritos and tortillo chips.

1396
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:18,325
And your mother shouldn't have
did them goddamn drugs

1397
01:18:18,393 --> 01:18:21,191
when she was pregnant with you! That's
what's wrong with your black ass!

1398
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:23,197
God, your titties
are huge, Betty.

1399
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:24,425
Look, I'm gonna
tell Daddy.

1400
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:28,026
I'm gonna tell my daddy that you are
in here trying to see my treats, Reggie.

1401
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:30,367
Wait, you're gonna be lying
if you tell him that!

1402
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:31,497
Then what was you
doing in here?

1403
01:18:31,573 --> 01:18:32,699
I thought that...

1404
01:18:32,774 --> 01:18:35,004
Can I just give you this
bubblegum and get on out of here?

1405
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:36,840
What? You wanted Chick-fil-A,
that's what you got.

1406
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:39,073
I'm Burger King.
I'm a Double Whopper.

1407
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:43,516
You want to see this dark meat? I don't
play that foolishness. You're sick.

1408
01:18:43,585 --> 01:18:49,285
I do want to see the black meat, but
I don't want to see a bundle of it.

1409
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:52,255
Get out of here,
you sick nasty bastard!

1410
01:18:54,996 --> 01:18:57,157
She gonna put me
out of my room.

1411
01:18:57,232 --> 01:19:01,134
She's a survivor... I'm a
survivor! Kiribati, my ass!

1412
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:05,402
Good night, vegan!

1413
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:10,806
Finally, peace at last.

1414
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:19,186
Bucky!

1415
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:30,126
You stinky dog! Bucky!

1416
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:31,722
Oh, hell no!

1417
01:19:36,738 --> 01:19:38,797
He done pissed in my eyes!

1418
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,403
It stinks! My eyes! It burns!

1419
01:19:42,477 --> 01:19:44,945
Oh, Lord! Oh! Oh...

1420
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:55,554
It stink. It stink. My eyes
are burning. It got in my mouth!

1421
01:19:56,224 --> 01:19:57,714
They're burning!

1422
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,693
Where did I go wrong with that boy?

1423
01:20:01,897 --> 01:20:06,231
Mama! Mama! Mama!

1424
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:07,632
Lord have mercy.

1425
01:20:07,702 --> 01:20:09,169
Mama!

1426
01:20:15,443 --> 01:20:17,206
I don't know
what that is.

1427
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:18,405
Hell, no, that ain't me.

1428
01:20:18,914 --> 01:20:20,279
What the...

1429
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:30,185
Come on, baby brother, ease up,
man. You got my eyes tearing.

1430
01:20:30,258 --> 01:20:33,250
My skin is all itchy.
Don't do that, man!

1431
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:36,494
Smells like garbage
truck juice out here.

1432
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:37,691
Today

1433
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:43,462
you all continue the Dry Springs
obstacle course tradition.

1434
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:49,839
So get out there and display that
Jenkins family athletic prowess!

1435
01:20:50,745 --> 01:20:54,237
And, no matter what, have fun!

1436
01:21:01,656 --> 01:21:03,351
Good luck, young man.
Make me proud.

1437
01:21:03,425 --> 01:21:05,188
Win something.
Go on, have a good time.

1438
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:06,522
Have fun.

1439
01:21:07,762 --> 01:21:11,289
Jamaal, nobody remembers
who came in second, okay?

1440
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:14,792
So you gotta get
pumped, right? Loosen up.

1441
01:21:16,404 --> 01:21:19,168
Loosen up your muscles. Come
on, loosen up! Come on, come on!

1442
01:21:19,241 --> 01:21:21,004
Win! Win! We're
winners. We're winners.

1443
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:23,476
Ease up now, Kiribati.

1444
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:26,412
Jamaal, go. This ain't none
of your business, Clyde.

1445
01:21:26,481 --> 01:21:28,847
Look, come on, man.
This is just kids having fun.

1446
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:31,317
Well, it ain't no fun getting beat.
You should know that, Cadillac man.

1447
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:35,186
Hey, that was one time! Even a
blind squirrel can find a nut.

1448
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:36,622
Who are you
calling a squirrel?

1449
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:38,420
"Who are you
calling a squirrel?"

1450
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:42,395
Roscoe, that's who!
A blind, stink-ass squirrel.

1451
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:45,499
And you the nut. Koo-koo!

1452
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:49,333
Hey, leave my lady out of this. I know
you're not calling my victory a fluke.

1453
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:51,462
Oh, fluke, luck, one
in a million shot, yeah.

1454
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:55,441
Well, bring it on, Clyde. We can
do this right here, right now.

1455
01:21:56,711 --> 01:21:59,441
He's always been a loser.
He's always gonna be a loser.

1456
01:22:01,283 --> 01:22:05,344
Hey, Daddy! Daddy, you hear these
fools? I'm gonna arrest them!

1457
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:12,458
You two been at this
for 20 years.

1458
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:16,054
Go ahead. Knock yourselves
out. Starting line, 10 minutes!

1459
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:18,429
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, Daddy! Yeah!

1460
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:21,060
Starting line, 10 minutes,
Clyde! Ten minutes. Ten minutes.

1461
01:22:21,136 --> 01:22:22,330
Ten minutes, Clyde!

1462
01:22:22,404 --> 01:22:23,530
Get him!

1463
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:25,505
Ten minutes to countdown,
baby! Come on, Clyde.

1464
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:27,803
Gunfight at the O.K. Corral!

1465
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:30,600
Oh, shoot,
it's the Negro Olympics!

1466
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:50,461
Dad, are you
sure about this?

1467
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:53,262
Focus, son.
Concentrate.

1468
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:58,435
Cut me in or cut it out!
Clyde is favored to do the job!

1469
01:22:58,606 --> 01:23:01,336
Good luck, 'Scoe. That's
right. Who gonna bet?

1470
01:23:01,409 --> 01:23:05,140
Y'all better strap yourselves in,
'cause this here's gonna be funny!

1471
01:23:05,213 --> 01:23:06,840
Hey, Reggie, let me
get some of that action!

1472
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:10,180
I got a pulled hamstring for
Clyde and a back spasm for Roscoe.

1473
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:14,387
RJ's in top shape.
Your man? No shape.

1474
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:17,090
Clyde is not my man.
We are just...

1475
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:18,352
Just friends.

1476
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,886
Yeah. Like you and RJ?

1477
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:23,387
What are you talking about?

1478
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:25,092
I've been watching you.

1479
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:28,624
Trying to win favor with Jamaal.
Realizing what you missed out on.

1480
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:31,399
It's pathetic.
And you're too late.

1481
01:23:31,473 --> 01:23:35,000
'Cause there are no second
chances for washed-up prom queens.

1482
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:36,805
Sorry. Sorry.

1483
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:38,539
Now, that was painful.
You a bad bitch.

1484
01:23:38,613 --> 01:23:39,637
You bad.

1485
01:23:39,714 --> 01:23:41,511
A bad bitch, Betty?
Please, okay?

1486
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:44,345
She is a fake celebrity,
all right?

1487
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:47,746
Her only claim to fame is trading
her panties for peanut butter.

1488
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:50,052
That's some nasty shit there.

1489
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:54,695
News flash, honey. Those
panties went for 20 grand online.

1490
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:56,560
Wait a minute. Twenty
grand for your panties?

1491
01:23:56,631 --> 01:23:57,655
Yes.

1492
01:23:57,732 --> 01:23:59,097
Well, wait, I got
some panties, okay?

1493
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:01,931
I got the good panties,
I got the thong panties,

1494
01:24:02,003 --> 01:24:03,971
I got the period panties.
They might...

1495
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:06,633
Betty, I got
a news flash for you.

1496
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:09,135
Bucky boned Fifi.

1497
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:10,438
Oh, Lord!

1498
01:24:10,512 --> 01:24:11,501
Well?

1499
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:12,807
Did he kill her?

1500
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,178
She was on top.

1501
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:15,580
The Pomegramian?

1502
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:17,844
Now that is a bad bitch.
- Oh, my God.

1503
01:24:17,919 --> 01:24:18,977
Fifi!

1504
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:20,146
Your dog's a whore!

1505
01:24:20,422 --> 01:24:22,947
All right.
On your mark!

1506
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:26,054
Get set!

1507
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:31,723
Run, baby!

1508
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:35,998
Get out the way!

1509
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:38,039
What is wrong
with them?

1510
01:24:47,949 --> 01:24:49,041
Go!

1511
01:24:49,117 --> 01:24:51,381
Oh, get back!
Don't want nothing...

1512
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:53,944
Hey, get back, sucka.
Watch out! Hey! Get off me!

1513
01:24:54,022 --> 01:24:55,387
I got him!
I'm going!

1514
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:00,055
Oh, no!
Share that!

1515
01:25:00,128 --> 01:25:01,493
Share that.

1516
01:25:01,563 --> 01:25:02,655
I'm gone!

1517
01:25:12,073 --> 01:25:14,268
Redemption!
Redemption!

1518
01:25:14,342 --> 01:25:15,969
Oh, no! No!

1519
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:17,272
Forget it!

1520
01:25:17,345 --> 01:25:19,245
You gotta go,
Rasta boy!

1521
01:25:21,483 --> 01:25:22,711
No!
Hey!

1522
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,525
Cannonball!

1523
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:37,019
Oh, shit!

1524
01:25:43,271 --> 01:25:45,501
Hit the floor, baby!
G.I. Joe!

1525
01:25:46,774 --> 01:25:49,334
Navy SEAL!
Navy SEAL!

1526
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:51,241
Slip and slide, Clyde!

1527
01:25:54,749 --> 01:25:58,116
Try the South Beach Diet,
fat-ass! Yeah!

1528
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:05,686
Come on, baby!

1529
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,751
No, you don't!

1530
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:11,328
Oh, hell no! No!

1531
01:26:18,706 --> 01:26:21,004
Man, I felt that
in my stomach.

1532
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:26,311
Come on, baby!
Let's go!

1533
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:28,542
No! No! Hold on!

1534
01:26:31,953 --> 01:26:33,511
Son, no! Wait!

1535
01:26:34,989 --> 01:26:36,479
Sorry, Dad!

1536
01:26:36,558 --> 01:26:38,958
You! You wait! You...

1537
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:43,327
Hold on, baby!
Hold on!

1538
01:26:43,398 --> 01:26:44,524
Go, Clyde, go!

1539
01:26:46,801 --> 01:26:47,893
Oh!

1540
01:26:50,605 --> 01:26:52,038
That's all right, baby!

1541
01:26:52,106 --> 01:26:53,505
Look at them
stretch marks!

1542
01:26:53,575 --> 01:26:55,406
Let's go, Jamaal! You can do it!
- Go! Go!

1543
01:26:55,476 --> 01:26:57,535
Whoo! Yeah!

1544
01:26:59,847 --> 01:27:01,872
It's your ass!
Come on...

1545
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:07,181
Oh, I got you now. See you
at the finish line, boy.

1546
01:27:07,755 --> 01:27:09,552
Get up, baby! Get up!

1547
01:27:12,627 --> 01:27:13,821
Yeah!
Yeah...

1548
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:15,590
You see that?
Upper body strength.

1549
01:27:15,663 --> 01:27:17,392
That's what being in
the gym will do for you!

1550
01:27:17,465 --> 01:27:21,458
Well, I'm a power runner. True
warrior! Man! I ain't never scared!

1551
01:27:21,536 --> 01:27:23,401
Yeah, me, neither!

1552
01:27:27,942 --> 01:27:30,206
I'm going down!
I'm going down!

1553
01:27:31,045 --> 01:27:32,478
Mama...

1554
01:27:33,381 --> 01:27:34,871
I'm gonna die!

1555
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:42,483
Go, Clyde, go!

1556
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:48,087
Go, RJ! Get him!

1557
01:27:55,336 --> 01:27:57,361
Help me, Dad!
Hey, come on!

1558
01:27:57,438 --> 01:27:59,065
Dad!
Dig in, come on!

1559
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:00,471
I can't!
Help! Dad!

1560
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:02,338
Come on, son!

1561
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:04,940
Come on, Clyde,
you can do it.

1562
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:12,249
Come on. Come on.
Come on, son! Go!

1563
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:14,920
I'm trying!
Dig in, son!

1564
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:19,188
Hurry up! Dig in! Go!

1565
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:23,694
Leave him, baby, leave him! Don't
let Clyde beat you! Don't let him win!

1566
01:28:24,565 --> 01:28:25,691
Win, RJ, win!

1567
01:28:25,767 --> 01:28:26,825
What?
What?

1568
01:28:26,901 --> 01:28:28,266
Go, go, go!

1569
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:32,572
Don't give up, son!
Don't give up!

1570
01:28:33,574 --> 01:28:35,041
Go, baby, go!

1571
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:38,806
Come on, baby! Go!

1572
01:28:42,884 --> 01:28:44,442
Watch out!

1573
01:28:45,553 --> 01:28:47,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa, baby.

1574
01:28:47,088 --> 01:28:48,885
No...
No, that's all right.

1575
01:28:48,956 --> 01:28:50,389
This is just a mess.

1576
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:52,285
Oh, yeah, sucker!

1577
01:28:54,028 --> 01:28:56,792
Oh, no! Hell, no!
Hell, no!

1578
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:05,237
Oh, no, you don't!
No, you don't!

1579
01:29:17,552 --> 01:29:20,612
Yeah! Yes! Yeah!

1580
01:29:21,122 --> 01:29:23,215
Welcome
to the top, winner!

1581
01:29:23,658 --> 01:29:25,489
Oh! Yeah!

1582
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:29,223
Give it up, Clyde.
I still got it.

1583
01:29:29,297 --> 01:29:32,824
This is gonna haunt your dreams
for the next 20 years! Yeah!

1584
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:35,161
Loser!
Callie!

1585
01:29:36,404 --> 01:29:38,463
Built for comfort,
not for speed.

1586
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:42,908
Hey, good save, Steroid
Stan! Good save, boy.

1587
01:29:42,977 --> 01:29:45,810
But you know what? Too bad
this ain't a team competition.

1588
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,110
You know why?
'Cause I'm the leader!

1589
01:29:48,182 --> 01:29:51,242
Yes! Captain
of the Team of Me!

1590
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:55,016
Just me! Just me, baby! Just me!

1591
01:29:55,757 --> 01:29:57,281
Yeah!

1592
01:30:01,362 --> 01:30:02,226
Come here, son.

1593
01:30:03,164 --> 01:30:04,392
No, thanks.

1594
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:07,462
Jamaal! Jamaal!

1595
01:30:10,338 --> 01:30:11,737
Jamaal! Jamaal!

1596
01:30:11,806 --> 01:30:14,172
What in God's name
is wrong with you?

1597
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:18,110
What? He challenged me, Daddy.
So I stepped to the plate.

1598
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:20,176
What was I supposed
to do, back down?

1599
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:23,877
Hey, don't use that tone with
me! Show some damn respect!

1600
01:30:23,951 --> 01:30:26,647
Where's my respect,
Daddy? Damn!

1601
01:30:26,721 --> 01:30:28,985
You've never given me
credit for nothing I done!

1602
01:30:29,056 --> 01:30:33,857
Credit for what? Winning a
child's race? Buying some fancy TV?

1603
01:30:34,662 --> 01:30:36,789
Or that bullshit
show of yours?

1604
01:30:36,864 --> 01:30:42,393
Yes! Yes, Daddy! Yes! Give me some
credit! Show me some damn credit!

1605
01:30:43,137 --> 01:30:46,300
Then I feel
very sorry for you.

1606
01:30:46,374 --> 01:30:48,274
So, Clyde gets off
easy again.

1607
01:30:50,845 --> 01:30:53,336
It wasn't just me
out there, Daddy.

1608
01:30:55,683 --> 01:30:59,517
I know he lost his father, but
why did I have to lose mine, too?

1609
01:30:59,587 --> 01:31:00,952
Why, Daddy?

1610
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:13,157
Well, now I see why you
stayed away for nine years.

1611
01:31:33,221 --> 01:31:36,884
Hey. Hey, Roscoe.
Look, man...

1612
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:40,186
I never tried
to take your place.

1613
01:31:40,261 --> 01:31:41,853
I was just trying
to fit in.

1614
01:31:42,430 --> 01:31:46,025
'Cause even though we're
cousins, you're my brother, man.

1615
01:31:56,577 --> 01:31:59,102
Oh, now you're Mr.
Innocent? Please!

1616
01:31:59,614 --> 01:32:01,980
Don't fall for it, honey. He's
just trying to suck you in.

1617
01:32:02,049 --> 01:32:04,916
Oh, look, heifer, your narrow
ass about to get sucked in

1618
01:32:04,986 --> 01:32:06,681
if something... Hey, don't
do this. You got a case.

1619
01:32:06,754 --> 01:32:08,278
I will cut you.

1620
01:32:08,489 --> 01:32:09,786
You got
a case pending.

1621
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:11,256
You know what?
We're going.

1622
01:32:11,325 --> 01:32:12,815
We're going.
I'm not afraid of her.

1623
01:32:12,894 --> 01:32:15,260
<i>You need to be afraid of her.
You don't watch Wild Kingdom?</i>

1624
01:32:15,329 --> 01:32:18,025
You ain't never seen
a lion attack a gazelle?

1625
01:32:18,099 --> 01:32:20,465
She about to smack the
CoverGirl off your face.

1626
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:21,763
You better
get up out of here.

1627
01:32:21,836 --> 01:32:24,236
'Scoe. 'Scoe.
Hey, look, man...

1628
01:32:24,305 --> 01:32:26,364
Let him go.
Let him go.

1629
01:32:27,141 --> 01:32:28,335
Get off of me,
Reggie!

1630
01:32:28,409 --> 01:32:29,433
Come on, baby.

1631
01:32:29,510 --> 01:32:32,308
I can see your spine.
Look at that snake!

1632
01:32:33,414 --> 01:32:36,872
It was so good
to see you, Jamaal.

1633
01:32:36,951 --> 01:32:37,975
Yeah.

1634
01:32:38,052 --> 01:32:39,280
Don't you forget
to stay in touch

1635
01:32:39,353 --> 01:32:41,787
with your grandma
and grandpa, you hear?

1636
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:44,450
I will.
Thanks, Mama Jenkins.

1637
01:32:46,527 --> 01:32:49,223
Well, here's something
for the road.

1638
01:32:49,297 --> 01:32:50,730
Meatloaf,
your favorite.

1639
01:32:50,798 --> 01:32:52,129
Thanks, Mama.

1640
01:32:52,199 --> 01:32:56,568
Oh, I just hate to see
you go. But I understand.

1641
01:32:56,637 --> 01:32:59,003
Lord have mercy,
I understand.

1642
01:33:01,075 --> 01:33:04,272
Just don't let it be
another nine years, okay?

1643
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:07,641
Promise?
Yeah.

1644
01:33:14,655 --> 01:33:16,054
We love you.

1645
01:33:18,859 --> 01:33:20,986
I love you, too, Mama.

1646
01:33:37,878 --> 01:33:41,507
Honey, don't be sad. I'm
sorry things didn't work out.

1647
01:33:42,817 --> 01:33:45,251
I promise
we'll fix this together.

1648
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:47,815
I hope so, baby.

1649
01:33:47,888 --> 01:33:49,287
We'll come up
with a new plan.

1650
01:33:50,391 --> 01:33:52,916
Yeah, we have more time
to work on the speech.

1651
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:57,690
We'll film the banquet in LA,
hire actors. It'll look better.

1652
01:33:58,699 --> 01:34:01,190
Hire actors?
To play my family?

1653
01:34:01,268 --> 01:34:02,792
Honey...

1654
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:06,772
We're getting married
and forming a powerful merger.

1655
01:34:07,975 --> 01:34:10,739
Where does your
family fit into that?

1656
01:34:10,811 --> 01:34:12,438
I guess they don't.

1657
01:34:12,513 --> 01:34:13,571
Dad, are you serious?

1658
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:14,740
Jamaal!

1659
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:19,419
Haven't you realized by now
who your father's become?

1660
01:34:19,487 --> 01:34:22,149
It's all about
the Team of Me.

1661
01:34:22,223 --> 01:34:24,987
This is Team Stevens,
and you need to get on board.

1662
01:34:25,059 --> 01:34:26,549
I'm a Jenkins.

1663
01:34:27,595 --> 01:34:29,825
RJ, please talk
to your son.

1664
01:34:36,103 --> 01:34:40,267
She's right, Jamaal. We
gotta move forward, all right?

1665
01:34:40,508 --> 01:34:42,908
You think just because
you bonded with everybody

1666
01:34:42,977 --> 01:34:45,912
I'm gonna send you down here
for summers and Christmases...

1667
01:34:47,114 --> 01:34:49,674
so you can be influenced by
these people? But... But, Dad!

1668
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:51,342
No buts, Jamaal.

1669
01:34:51,419 --> 01:34:54,047
In fact, you know, let's not
even invite them to the wedding.

1670
01:34:54,121 --> 01:34:58,785
Oh, my God!
I'm so glad you said that!

1671
01:34:58,859 --> 01:35:01,419
I've been thinking that
ever since I met Betty.

1672
01:35:01,896 --> 01:35:04,888
I don't blame you.
Bitch ain't got no class.

1673
01:35:04,965 --> 01:35:06,694
You can say that again.

1674
01:35:10,905 --> 01:35:12,270
No class.

1675
01:35:12,339 --> 01:35:15,900
We can say that about a
few people in your family.

1676
01:35:15,976 --> 01:35:17,534
Right, baby?

1677
01:35:17,611 --> 01:35:18,805
Right?

1678
01:35:23,517 --> 01:35:25,576
Honey, you are so
doing the right thing.

1679
01:35:26,454 --> 01:35:29,912
And making me
so hot in the process.

1680
01:35:30,124 --> 01:35:31,250
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

1681
01:35:31,325 --> 01:35:34,419
Well, prepare to cool off,
'cause I'm done with you.

1682
01:35:34,495 --> 01:35:39,660
You crazy-ass bitch! You
know what? Thank you, Bianca.

1683
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:41,162
Thank you so much

1684
01:35:41,235 --> 01:35:45,501
for letting me finally see you
for the arrogant, sex-crazed,

1685
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:49,532
pretentious, fake-ass
celebrity wannabe that you are.

1686
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:51,703
Thank you, Bianca.
Thank you.

1687
01:35:51,779 --> 01:35:56,239
Oh, well,
you're so welcome, Roscoe!

1688
01:35:56,317 --> 01:35:58,615
I knew it.
You can't handle me.

1689
01:35:58,686 --> 01:36:01,780
You're not man enough.
You don't have the balls!

1690
01:36:03,057 --> 01:36:05,753
King Kong don't have
the balls! Bounce!

1691
01:36:07,161 --> 01:36:09,925
You just signed your
career death certificate.

1692
01:36:09,997 --> 01:36:12,363
Our alliance
is officially over!

1693
01:36:12,433 --> 01:36:13,991
And so are you.
Come on, Fiona.

1694
01:36:16,237 --> 01:36:18,102
Come on, Fifi.
Come to Mommy.

1695
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:21,735
It looks like
your alliance is over,

1696
01:36:21,809 --> 01:36:24,141
and you've been
voted off the island.

1697
01:36:24,211 --> 01:36:27,647
Bianca, the tribe
has spoken. Bounce!

1698
01:36:32,987 --> 01:36:34,477
Dad, you're the man!

1699
01:36:34,555 --> 01:36:36,250
I told you
who the boss was.

1700
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:39,721
Let's go.

1701
01:36:40,795 --> 01:36:42,285
Wait, my bags!

1702
01:36:53,274 --> 01:36:55,606
I love you, son.
I love you, too, Dad.

1703
01:36:55,843 --> 01:36:56,969
Let's go home.

1704
01:37:01,348 --> 01:37:03,373
<i>Mama said,</i>

1705
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:04,917
<i>"Girl, it ain't right</i>

1706
01:37:04,985 --> 01:37:08,284
<i>"to throw hot grits on a man
when you have a disagreement. "</i>

1707
01:37:09,056 --> 01:37:12,492
<i>Sound advice. Real good
advice, but did I listen?</i>

1708
01:37:13,294 --> 01:37:15,524
<i>No. Old Betty
had to do it her way.</i>

1709
01:37:15,596 --> 01:37:17,723
<i>And that was
my second husband.</i>

1710
01:37:17,898 --> 01:37:19,263
<i>God knows I didn't
mean to burn him.</i>

1711
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:21,301
<i>But my third husband,
Buck, baby...</i>

1712
01:37:21,368 --> 01:37:22,767
<i>Buck was good to me!</i>

1713
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:24,429
<i>And any time
you get somebody</i>

1714
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:26,268
<i>that's good to you
like that, you love 'em.</i>

1715
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:29,468
Big black Buck had the
keloid hanging from the ear.

1716
01:37:30,611 --> 01:37:32,579
Looked like he had a
leather hearing aid. Stop!

1717
01:37:32,646 --> 01:37:34,170
<i>Daddy, I know you
didn't like Buck a lot,</i>

1718
01:37:34,248 --> 01:37:36,808
<i>but Buck was a good man
when he got out of jail.</i>

1719
01:37:36,884 --> 01:37:39,614
<i>I'm gonna tell you something. He did
everything he said he was gonna do.</i>

1720
01:37:39,687 --> 01:37:41,917
<i>And do you know,
Buck was the only man,</i>

1721
01:37:41,989 --> 01:37:44,787
<i>the only man
that could pick me up?</i>

1722
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:46,850
<i>Baby, y'all don't
know what it's like</i>

1723
01:37:46,927 --> 01:37:48,690
<i>for a man to scoop
you up like that.</i>

1724
01:37:48,762 --> 01:37:50,389
<i>Betty. Betty... I'm
trying to tell 'em!</i>

1725
01:37:50,464 --> 01:37:51,931
<i>Scoop you like...
Betty.</i>

1726
01:37:51,999 --> 01:37:54,399
<i>Get off of me! I'm
not finished. Betty.</i>

1727
01:37:54,535 --> 01:37:56,230
<i>You a hater!
I ain't no hater.</i>

1728
01:37:56,303 --> 01:37:57,793
We only got
five hours to be here.

1729
01:37:57,872 --> 01:37:59,134
<i>Shut up!</i>

1730
01:38:00,741 --> 01:38:03,608
Thank you, Betty!
Thank you! Yeah!

1731
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:09,907
<i>And now for our next testimonial.
It'll come from Clyde.</i>

1732
01:38:15,956 --> 01:38:19,119
<i>All right, how's everybody
doing? Ain't God good?</i>

1733
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:21,027
All the time.

1734
01:38:21,195 --> 01:38:23,789
<i>It is a pleasure and
a privilege to be here</i>

1735
01:38:23,864 --> 01:38:27,732
<i>for Papa J and Mama
J's 50th anniversary.</i>

1736
01:38:27,801 --> 01:38:30,668
<i>Lord, growing up in this Jenkins
household was something else.</i>

1737
01:38:30,771 --> 01:38:34,298
<i>And Papa J is a strong man. I
mean, well, this the kind of person,</i>

1738
01:38:34,375 --> 01:38:35,933
<i>when he say he'll
slap the black off you,</i>

1739
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:38,035
<i>I mean the black
really will come off.</i>

1740
01:38:38,145 --> 01:38:40,807
<i>I woke up light-skinned at
least three times in my life.</i>

1741
01:38:42,683 --> 01:38:44,651
<i>Yeah, I got it all back.</i>

1742
01:38:44,718 --> 01:38:46,913
You all right?
You barely ate.

1743
01:38:47,788 --> 01:38:50,256
<i>But you know, working
in his hardware store...</i>

1744
01:38:50,658 --> 01:38:53,183
I just wish
Roscoe were here.

1745
01:38:53,694 --> 01:38:56,891
Roscoe
made his choice.

1746
01:38:56,964 --> 01:38:58,625
You didn't give him
much of one.

1747
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:03,829
What was I supposed to do? Be
disrespected in my own home?

1748
01:39:04,972 --> 01:39:06,462
Be his father.

1749
01:39:08,542 --> 01:39:11,534
Giving him your name
doesn't make him you, Roscoe.

1750
01:39:13,047 --> 01:39:16,813
It doesn't make him Betty
or Otis or even Clyde.

1751
01:39:17,451 --> 01:39:21,012
He's Roscoe Junior. RJ.

1752
01:39:21,689 --> 01:39:25,216
And for a boy who didn't feel
the support of his family,

1753
01:39:26,493 --> 01:39:28,927
he's doing quite well
for himself.

1754
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:31,327
<i>...sleeping in
the bottom bunk bed,</i>

1755
01:39:31,398 --> 01:39:33,491
<i>you know,
under RJ, and then</i>

1756
01:39:33,567 --> 01:39:35,831
<i>I was nervous 'cause
he would pee in the bed.</i>

1757
01:39:35,903 --> 01:39:37,928
<i>And that would, you
know, that would...</i>

1758
01:39:38,005 --> 01:39:39,996
<i>I would have
some scary nights sometime.</i>

1759
01:39:40,074 --> 01:39:43,271
<i>You know, it's hard sleeping
with a raincoat on, you know.</i>

1760
01:39:43,344 --> 01:39:45,904
<i>And, you know, and...</i>

1761
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:48,380
<i>And I tried to explain
to them that, you know,</i>

1762
01:39:48,449 --> 01:39:51,714
<i>that's Roscoe the one that's
peeing in the bed, not me.</i>

1763
01:39:51,785 --> 01:39:53,776
<i>And, he...</i>

1764
01:39:59,226 --> 01:40:03,128
<i>You know, just the way they
took me in was so gracious.</i>

1765
01:40:03,197 --> 01:40:05,995
<i>They didn't have to
do that. I thank you.</i>

1766
01:40:06,433 --> 01:40:07,957
<i>I thank y'all and...</i>

1767
01:40:08,035 --> 01:40:10,970
<i>Because I don't know where
I would be right now if...</i>

1768
01:40:13,107 --> 01:40:15,337
Nigga, what is you crying for?

1769
01:40:15,676 --> 01:40:19,442
Big old Sugar Bear-looking-ass
boy. Sitting up there crying.

1770
01:40:19,513 --> 01:40:21,606
He's still wearing the
pajamas with the feet in 'em.

1771
01:40:23,817 --> 01:40:26,581
<i>Wow, I've never seen
Clyde cry before.</i>

1772
01:40:29,623 --> 01:40:33,491
<i>Ain't nobody crying.
I'm just cleansing.</i>

1773
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:37,627
<i>No, those some real
tears right there. I know.</i>

1774
01:40:38,966 --> 01:40:43,403
<i>I've cried more than a newborn
baby getting his ass popped.</i>

1775
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:46,032
Hey, guys.

1776
01:40:46,106 --> 01:40:48,438
<i>I've been beat up...
Hey, Jamaal!</i>

1777
01:40:48,509 --> 01:40:51,239
<i>...insulted,
laughed at...</i>

1778
01:40:52,613 --> 01:40:53,602
<i>A lot.</i>

1779
01:40:56,083 --> 01:40:58,278
<i>Hey, you're laughing already.</i>

1780
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:02,382
<i>I lost more games
and competitions</i>

1781
01:41:02,456 --> 01:41:03,753
<i>to Clyde
than I can remember.</i>

1782
01:41:04,658 --> 01:41:08,355
<i>Oh, 3,459 and counting.</i>

1783
01:41:10,998 --> 01:41:13,262
<i>Thank you, Clyde.</i>

1784
01:41:15,569 --> 01:41:17,560
<i>I thought I was a loser.</i>

1785
01:41:18,038 --> 01:41:20,097
<i>So I went away</i>

1786
01:41:20,174 --> 01:41:22,938
<i>and transformed myself into
what I thought was a winner.</i>

1787
01:41:25,746 --> 01:41:30,445
<i>But being around y'all is a 24/7</i>

1788
01:41:32,019 --> 01:41:33,213
<i>reality check.</i>

1789
01:41:33,821 --> 01:41:35,812
<i>Y'all rough on a brother.</i>

1790
01:41:36,957 --> 01:41:41,621
<i>The clothes,
the car, the Survivor...</i>

1791
01:41:45,265 --> 01:41:46,493
<i>Y'all pull no punches.</i>

1792
01:41:46,567 --> 01:41:48,330
You know that's right!

1793
01:41:49,403 --> 01:41:52,167
<i>Betty, you got
a hell of a right hand.</i>

1794
01:41:53,006 --> 01:41:56,373
<i>That's no joke. And O, you
got a hell of a left hand.</i>

1795
01:41:57,678 --> 01:41:59,145
<i>That's right.</i>

1796
01:41:59,213 --> 01:42:01,374
<i>But look, I...</i>

1797
01:42:01,448 --> 01:42:05,407
<i>I want to thank you,
all of you, my family.</i>

1798
01:42:08,188 --> 01:42:10,816
<i>Thank you for making
me a better man.</i>

1799
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:14,860
<i>For giving me strength to...</i>

1800
01:42:14,928 --> 01:42:17,988
<i>To withstand anything
this world throws at me.</i>

1801
01:42:19,867 --> 01:42:21,767
<i>For unconditional love,</i>

1802
01:42:23,570 --> 01:42:25,561
<i>and a place to call home.</i>

1803
01:42:27,641 --> 01:42:30,337
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna cry.

1804
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:37,140
<i>Happy Anniversary,
Mommy, Daddy. I love you.</i>

1805
01:42:49,329 --> 01:42:52,423
I'm so proud of you.

1806
01:42:52,499 --> 01:42:55,764
I know. We all need love.

1807
01:42:57,104 --> 01:42:58,969
Yeah, come on, Clyde.
We gonna let them

1808
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:01,064
have this moment, all
right? I just want a hug, O.

1809
01:43:01,141 --> 01:43:02,438
I know, baby.
Come over here and let's...

1810
01:43:02,509 --> 01:43:04,204
Son,

1811
01:43:04,278 --> 01:43:08,374
if I ever drove you away, if
I ever made you feel unworthy,

1812
01:43:09,316 --> 01:43:14,015
I'm sorry. I love you.
Glad to have you back.

1813
01:43:14,288 --> 01:43:17,382
And those words you just
said, that's the best gift

1814
01:43:17,457 --> 01:43:19,982
I've ever received,
RJ Stevens.

1815
01:43:20,928 --> 01:43:24,557
Well, it's from the heart,
Daddy. And the name is Jenkins.

1816
01:43:26,533 --> 01:43:31,061
Roscoe Steven Jenkins.
Just like my daddy.

1817
01:43:33,774 --> 01:43:34,763
Aw.

1818
01:43:37,945 --> 01:43:39,936
Reggie, come here. What the
hell is wrong with you, nigga?

1819
01:43:40,013 --> 01:43:43,449
What the hell has gotten
into you? Man, he needs help.

1820
01:43:54,628 --> 01:43:56,220
Go get her, son.

1821
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:15,143
Lucinda?
Yes?

1822
01:44:16,149 --> 01:44:19,243
I waited 20 years
to create this opportunity.

1823
01:44:21,255 --> 01:44:23,223
Would you dance with me?

1824
01:44:25,192 --> 01:44:26,625
I'd love to.

1825
01:44:32,432 --> 01:44:34,525
Lucinda, I'm happy for you.

1826
01:44:35,535 --> 01:44:39,130
Hey! Betty, come on, let's get
out here and cut a rug, girl.

1827
01:44:39,206 --> 01:44:41,401
Negro, we're cousins.
That's nasty!

1828
01:44:41,475 --> 01:44:44,410
So desperate.
That's a damn shame.

1829
01:44:44,478 --> 01:44:47,936
You gonna play me for him?
He got on an ankle bracelet!

1830
01:45:10,137 --> 01:45:11,968
Thank you.

1831
01:45:18,345 --> 01:45:20,336
Did you see
the bedroom?

1832
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:42,234
Look at Roscoe
trying to be in love.

1833
01:45:42,302 --> 01:45:44,167
I heard that.

1834
01:45:44,237 --> 01:45:45,795
Now,
that's a good picture.

1835
01:45:45,939 --> 01:45:48,669
Oh, look at that. Yeah,
this should be good.

1836
01:45:49,476 --> 01:45:51,376
There's Sugar Bear Clyde.

1837
01:45:51,445 --> 01:45:54,209
Look at that.

1838
01:45:55,982 --> 01:45:57,973
That looks good, Reggie.
That's a blue bonnet, baby.

1839
01:45:59,252 --> 01:46:01,550
Pow! That boy crazy
right there, isn't he?

1840
01:46:02,556 --> 01:46:04,547
We do have
one hell of a family.

1841
01:46:04,624 --> 01:46:06,182
We sure do, Daddy.

1842
01:46:06,393 --> 01:46:08,554
Where are
those two anyway?

1843
01:46:08,628 --> 01:46:10,255
Oh, Ma, you know
where they are.

1844
01:46:10,330 --> 01:46:11,957
That's nice.

1845
01:46:24,945 --> 01:46:26,242
Uh-uh.

1846
01:46:41,895 --> 01:46:45,387
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
your host, Roscoe Jenkins!</i>

1847
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:49,701
All right. Thank you, thank you.

1848
01:46:50,504 --> 01:46:55,271
You all looking good. Looking
good. What's good, family?

1849
01:46:55,976 --> 01:46:58,877
Today's show
is about family.

1850
01:46:58,979 --> 01:47:02,244
And what better way to kick it
off than with the doctor's own?

1851
01:47:03,016 --> 01:47:05,985
Say hello
to the Jenkins clan.

1852
01:47:06,052 --> 01:47:08,043
Hey, y'all!
Hey, everybody!

1853
01:47:08,121 --> 01:47:10,919
Ow! Pump, pump, pump, pump, pump,
pump, pa-pump! Pump, pump, pump, pump!

1854
01:47:10,991 --> 01:47:12,083
Betty. Betty. Yes!

1855
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:13,490
Mind your
own business, Otis.

1856
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:15,152
We'll be right back. We just
trying to have a good time

1857
01:47:15,228 --> 01:47:17,662
here on 'Scoe's show. You
always gotta say something.

1858
01:47:17,731 --> 01:47:20,598
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

1859
01:47:21,168 --> 01:47:22,897
Let's get started.

1860
01:47:24,838 --> 01:47:27,932
You're a doctor,
so tell me this.

1861
01:47:28,008 --> 01:47:31,500
Why am I having trouble
reaching an orgasm?

1862
01:47:32,245 --> 01:47:33,405
So you've never
been able to?

1863
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:35,914
Now, I know how to get
myself to the destination,

1864
01:47:35,982 --> 01:47:38,382
I just need a captain
to navigate the waters.

1865
01:47:38,452 --> 01:47:40,181
Now, 'Scoe, you
got to help me here.

1866
01:47:40,253 --> 01:47:43,222
Is that thing physical
or is that thing mental?

1867
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:44,917
Or is it emotional, 'Scoe?

1868
01:47:44,991 --> 01:47:46,788
Like, where do
you go to find...

1869
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:48,521
Can we cut?
I'm... I'm uncomfortable.

1870
01:47:48,595 --> 01:47:50,028
Wait a minute, 'Scoe. I'm
just trying to figure out

1871
01:47:50,096 --> 01:47:51,893
how I'm supposed
to get mine, okay?

1872
01:47:51,965 --> 01:47:54,092
So you think it's okay
to spank your kids.

1873
01:47:54,167 --> 01:47:57,534
Yeah, I spank my kids.
I get in their...

1874
01:47:57,604 --> 01:47:59,902
They... up,
I start... them up.

1875
01:47:59,973 --> 01:48:00,997
Tag team.

1876
01:48:01,074 --> 01:48:03,474
Oh, cuss words.

1877
01:48:03,543 --> 01:48:05,511
Oh, gee, I'm sorry.

1878
01:48:05,579 --> 01:48:08,309
...that!
You know me, man.

1879
01:48:08,381 --> 01:48:12,215
Hustling is my job. I mean, I
ain't never really paid no rent.

1880
01:48:12,285 --> 01:48:15,186
You know what I'm saying? I
ain't never really paid no bills.

1881
01:48:15,255 --> 01:48:17,223
You know what I'm
saying? So... But I...

1882
01:48:17,290 --> 01:48:20,589
For some reason, I've
always got cash in my pocket!

1883
01:48:21,261 --> 01:48:23,627
I guess it's 'cause
I got a honest face.

1884
01:48:26,066 --> 01:48:27,055
I mean,
I don't know,

1885
01:48:27,133 --> 01:48:28,964
you might have a problem
with that since, when we was

1886
01:48:29,035 --> 01:48:32,004
little I would always beat
you. You know what I'm saying?

1887
01:48:32,072 --> 01:48:34,870
You pull out the cards, you one,
two, three, you draw four, I'm like...

1888
01:48:35,208 --> 01:48:39,042
Uno. You know what I'm saying?
You make a move, I'm C-4, C-2...

1889
01:48:39,813 --> 01:48:42,441
I sunk your battleship. You
remember that, don't you?

1890
01:48:42,516 --> 01:48:44,643
And then he be finished.
I'm like, "Damn!

1891
01:48:44,718 --> 01:48:46,777
"Is something wrong
with my... My cakes?"

1892
01:48:46,953 --> 01:48:48,580
You know what I'm
saying? I don't know if

1893
01:48:48,655 --> 01:48:50,020
something wrong with
my tastycakes, 'Scoe.

1894
01:48:50,090 --> 01:48:51,853
You actually
tase your kids?

1895
01:48:51,925 --> 01:48:53,654
Hell, yeah,
I tase my... kids.

1896
01:48:53,727 --> 01:48:55,592
You shock 'em,
they be like...

1897
01:48:55,662 --> 01:48:58,756
I say, "You gonna take out
that trash now?" He just...

1898
01:48:58,832 --> 01:49:00,231
For not taking
out the trash?

1899
01:49:02,969 --> 01:49:07,463
45,000 volts right through
his big... "Yes... Dad... "

1900
01:49:08,775 --> 01:49:09,764
Yeah.

1901
01:49:09,843 --> 01:49:13,609
Hold it, hold up.
Who is this? Yeah, what it is?

1902
01:49:14,981 --> 01:49:17,950
Man, I'm on the show. You ain't
watching? I'm on the show right now!

1903
01:49:18,084 --> 01:49:21,520
I ain't gotta... No, I'm on
the show. Look at me. Look.

1904
01:49:22,856 --> 01:49:26,314
We could do it right now,
bro. You put your hands up...

1905
01:49:26,526 --> 01:49:28,619
Or rock-paper-scissors.

1906
01:49:28,695 --> 01:49:31,163
We could do it right here. I mean,
you know, what you scratching for?

1907
01:49:31,231 --> 01:49:34,291
You know, you want to scratch?
You want to have a scratch battle?

1908
01:49:34,367 --> 01:49:37,200
'Cause we can scratch out. We
can... We could DJ scratch...

1909
01:49:38,204 --> 01:49:41,662
I'll make me a bubble bath,
light me some little candles,

1910
01:49:41,841 --> 01:49:46,073
and then I gets down in that
water, 'Scoe, and I be...

1911
01:49:46,179 --> 01:49:48,511
I'm thinking about it right
now. Let me get myself together.

1912
01:49:48,582 --> 01:49:50,243
Cut! Cut!
God forgive me.

1913
01:49:50,317 --> 01:49:54,151
Take the $150, go buy you a
eight ball. Flip the eight ball,

1914
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:57,986
you gonna make 300 off that.
Take the 300, get you a quarter.

1915
01:49:58,058 --> 01:50:01,084
Take the quarter ounce, flip
that. Stay over at Aunt Lea's...

1916
01:50:01,161 --> 01:50:03,288
Like if you... If there
wasn't an audience out there,

1917
01:50:03,363 --> 01:50:05,593
I would race you up and
down the audience steps.

1918
01:50:05,665 --> 01:50:07,860
We can go. You know we can go, too.

1919
01:50:07,934 --> 01:50:10,835
Take the half ounce money,
flip the half ounce money.

1920
01:50:10,971 --> 01:50:14,202
Now you ready for a ounce.
You got a quarter ki now!

1921
01:50:14,274 --> 01:50:15,935
Now everybody
in the neighborhood

1922
01:50:16,009 --> 01:50:18,273
got on new sneakers
and walkie-talkies.

1923
01:50:18,345 --> 01:50:19,744
Everybody
is working for you,

1924
01:50:19,813 --> 01:50:22,304
you doing your thing
and everything.

1925
01:50:26,319 --> 01:50:29,846
I hope the feds ain't watching
this. I'll call you back.

1926
01:50:31,891 --> 01:50:36,123
I am. I am afraid, okay? I'm...
I'm... I'm afraid of being hurt,

1927
01:50:36,196 --> 01:50:37,857
and I don't
want to be hurt.

1928
01:50:37,931 --> 01:50:39,489
You pursue
unattainable men.

1929
01:50:40,967 --> 01:50:43,595
What? You want men you can't have.

1930
01:50:43,670 --> 01:50:46,264
Men I can't have?

1931
01:50:46,339 --> 01:50:49,365
Listen here... okay? I can
have any man I want, okay?

1932
01:50:49,442 --> 01:50:50,966
Don't get me
twisted, 'Scoe.

1933
01:50:51,044 --> 01:50:54,172
I am pretty in the face
and thick around the waist.

1934
01:50:54,247 --> 01:50:56,647
You better ask somebody.
I got sugar walls!

1935
01:50:56,716 --> 01:50:58,081
This right here
is sweet tea.

1936
01:50:58,184 --> 01:50:59,947
Ain't that
right, baby?

1937
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:01,044
Yo, ma.

1938
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:06,092
Yeah. I'm saying, Doc,
the booty is illmatic!

1939
01:51:07,060 --> 01:51:11,087
Well, that wasn't quite
what a brother had in mind.

1940
01:51:11,231 --> 01:51:12,960
But that's the thing
about family.

1941
01:51:13,033 --> 01:51:15,365
Unpredictable,
but entertaining.

1942
01:51:15,869 --> 01:51:18,007
And we love 'em.
Peace.
