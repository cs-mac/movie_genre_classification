{3180}{3258}You guys know the drill.|I got to get ready for the game.
{3260}{3320}- Damn.|-Mr. Jeffiries. Mr.Jeffiries.
{3322}{3392}Can I please have|your autograph?
{3394}{3462}Yeah. Sure, kid. Ricky.
{3564}{3601}A stamp?
{3602}{3693}You're welcome, kid.|Stay in school. Be like Jamal.
{4122}{4212}Another monster dunk|by Jam-all. The kid is on fire tonight.
{4214}{4260}Kenny, that's what|I'm talking about.
{4262}{4333}That six-game suspension|did him some good. His mind is right.
{4438}{4513}-Ooh! Ooh!
{4514}{4561}Ooh!
{4562}{4654}- Come and get some of this, boy.|- What you got, smurf?
{4655}{4710}What you got,|big smurf? Huh? Huh?
{4712}{4765}Bam! Somebody catch me.
{4932}{4986}Did I come down on you?
{4988}{5070}If you had a little bit more game,|maybe you wouldn't be crying.
{5072}{5137}If you were just a little taller.|A little bit taller.
{5139}{5181}Here we go again.
{5338}{5384}- What's up with that, man?|- I'm supposed to let you through?
{5386}{5422}- Is that five?|- Yep.
{5424}{5517}Here's the problem. That's five fouls|on Jam-all. One more, he's done.
{5518}{5565}That'd set a team record|for disqualifications.
{5566}{5649}- Hearn, get in there for Jeffries.|- Ref, I was going for the ball.
{5650}{5710}You need to watch the game.|You're missing a good one.
{5711}{5769}- Jamal, you out, man. I got you.|- I ain't going nowhere.
{5770}{5817}- Go tap somebody else.|- Time out!
{5818}{5873}- Time out!
{5875}{5972}I was born with it, baby.|Don't be jealous. Don't be jealous.
{5974}{6041}- Jamal, you're out.|- What do you mean I'm out?
{6043}{6113}I'm out? I'm out of what, Coach?|What you gonna do, fire me?
{6114}{6161}I'm the head coach.|I call the shots.
{6162}{6245}Wait. Hold on. You may call the shots,|but I'm making all the shots.
{6247}{6300}Coach, you see that?|Look at that scoreboard.
{6302}{6397}That's me, bro. All me. You may be coach|of this damn team, but I am the team.
{6399}{6469}There isn't a team in this league that|wouldn't kill to have a player like me.
{6470}{6545}- They can have you.|- Yeah? And you can have this...
{6547}{6584}Coach.
{6706}{6781}Yeah, boo you.|You want something to boo about?
{6782}{6833}Huh? How about this?
{6860}{6913}- Yeah, boo you too.|- Boo!
{6914}{6989}Yeah, yeah, boo you.|Yeah, boo you.
{6991}{7110}This is the most disgusting display|of unsportsmanlike conduct|I have ever seen.
{7111}{7169}How about this?
{7214}{7305}- Oh, Lord.|- Change that to second most.
{7306}{7366}- Ha!|- Oh, my God.
{7474}{7556}You like it. You like it,|don't you, ladies?
{7558}{7625}How you like me now?
{7626}{7682}Last night|Beat guard Jamal Jeffries...
{7684}{7734}gave the fans much more|than they bargained for...
{7736}{7845}when he decided to get ready|for the showers a little early|at the Charlotte Coliseum.
{7847}{7921}Say hello|to my little friend.
{7923}{7978}How you like me now?
{7980}{8067}I don't know what the big deal is.|We are all born naked.
{8069}{8130}I like being naked.|Don't you like being naked?
{8132}{8205}J.J., he sort of lost it tonight,|but, hey, it happens.
{8206}{8300}I think we as professional athletes|got to be role models to the kids...
{8302}{8353}because they look up|to us in the community.
{8354}{8401}Yo, Rasheed, you suck.
{8402}{8462}Well, say it|to my face then, chump.
{8463}{8529}Whatever the league|decides to do in this case...
{8530}{8577}they won't get|an argument from us.
{8579}{8647}The commissioner of basketball will|be having a press conference later...
{8648}{8709}to announce what penalties|the league will be imposing.
{8710}{8770}We were able to get|the reaction of Jamal's agent.
{8771}{8828}I spoke with Jamal|earlier today...
{8830}{8897}and, naturally,|he's feeling quite remorseful...
{8899}{8961}regarding|his losing control.
{8963}{9020}I happen to know, in fact,|that at this very moment...
{9022}{9112}he's quietly reflecting on|his inappropriate behavior.
{9114}{9220}Mmmmmmmmmm....|Ow!
{9222}{9268}Give it to me.|Give it to me.
{9359}{9394}Whoo!
{9395}{9462}I love this game, baby!
{9464}{9566}What's up? What's up in here? Having a|good time? Everybody having a good time?
{9568}{9655}- I ain't groovin'|unless I got three booties.
{9657}{9710}- Throw your hands up.|Throw your hands up.|- Mm-mm-mm.
{9712}{9796}Look at that, out there|with the three skankateers.
{9798}{9864}Girl, I don't know|how you put up with that.
{9866}{9914}Honey, all these|tricks is dogs.
{9916}{10005}But if you have to sleep in a doghouse,|it might as well look like this one.
{10006}{10041}True.
{10067}{10114}- Work it! Work it!
{10115}{10196}Hey, hey, hey!|I know you hear the phone!
{10198}{10277}You see me talkin' business.|Get the phone. Go get the phone!
{10278}{10330}I ain't deaf.
{10332}{10412}I got to rethink|cloning. Uhh!
{10526}{10571}Yeah!
{10573}{10642}- Phone call.|- What do you want me to do? I'm busy.
{10644}{10690}Tell 'em I'm not here.
{10692}{10777}- Sorry, Aunt Ruby, but Jamal|can't come to the phone--|- Aunt Ruby?
{10816}{10862}Out.
{10864}{10918}Y'all heard me. Out.
{10920}{11005}Boy, what in the world is the matter|with you? Have you lost your mind?
{11006}{11054}Have you plum|lost your mind?
{11056}{11141}- I was ready to call you--|- Don't interrupt me|when I'm talking to you.
{11143}{11205}- I know, but I'm--|- I said don't interrupt me.
{11206}{11246}Yes, ma'am.
{11248}{11308}I'm sitting here last night,|watching the game with my girlfriends...
{11310}{11404}and the next thing I know|I'm looking at your naked butt cheeks.
{11406}{11474}I read the TV guide, Jamal,|and nowhere did it say...
{11476}{11602}that I would see my nephew Jamal's|scrawny ass on channel 1 8 at 8:00.
{11604}{11653}I know, Aunt Ruby, but--
{11655}{11774}You think you can carry on|any ol' way, any ol' how|just 'cause you feel like it?
{11810}{11866}Answer me when|I'm talking to you, boy!
{11868}{11938}- But you just told me not to interrupt.|- I don't care what I said.
{11940}{12025}- |- Wait a minute. Is that music|I hear over there?
{12026}{12113}- You having a party?|- No. That stupid girl got her TV up.
{12115}{12189}Are you-- You know what? I'm not|gonna raise my blood pressure...
{12190}{12237}and get upset|over this nonsense.
{12238}{12269}Calm down.
{12270}{12345}- Yeah, take a deep breath.|- Oh, Lord.
{12346}{12422}They talking about you|on television, J.J..
{12424}{12522}- They talking about me on TV?|- Is there an echo on this phone? Yeah!
{12524}{12588}- Turn it on! I got to go!|- Hello?
{12590}{12642}The league has had enough.
{12644}{12701}Professional basketball|can no longer sit idly by...
{12702}{12780}and watch its players undermine|the integrity of this game.
{12782}{12897}As of today, Jamal Jeffiries|is suspended, indefinitely.
{12898}{12958}No more questions, please.
{12960}{13055}Hey, don't worry|about all that, y'all.
{13057}{13103}This is all gonna blow over.|You know how it is.
{13105}{13173}It's just the man trying to hold|a brother down. You know how they do it.
{13174}{13285}Pro basketball needs Jamal Jeffries.|This is gonna blow over.
{13287}{13346}Blow over. Trust me.
{13348}{13355}No, Friday's|no good for me.
{13355}{13400}No, Friday's|no good for me.
{13402}{13476}You know what?|I'm gonna have to call you back.
{13504}{13570}My client from Chippendale's|just showed up.
{13572}{13661}Yeah, all right. Bye-bye.|Hey, Jamal.
{13663}{13712}What's up, baby?|Shoot me straight.
{13714}{13809}I talked to the Beat about an hour ago|and they've dropped your contract.
{13811}{13874}Well, too bad for the Beat.|They can drop all they want.
{13876}{13952}My stuff is guaranteed.|Jamal's contract's guaranteed.
{13954}{14000}Was guaranteed.
{14002}{14076}Yeah. There's a little thing|in the contract called a morals clause...
{14078}{14146}and since, well,|you don't seem to have any...
{14147}{14218}the contract becomes null|and his trusty sidekick void.
{14219}{14329}So you the sidekick, right? Then|earn your money and get on the horn.
{14330}{14418}Shop me around to other teams.|Come on, Tonto. Let's go.
{14420}{14488}That's pretty much|how I spent my entire day.
{14490}{14555}Talked to every team,|every single team.
{14557}{14621}Nobody wants you.|You know why? You're a head case.
{14622}{14696}Well, then bump 'em.|Bump 'em all. Jamal don't need them.
{14698}{14770}Send me to Europe.|I like foreign women.
{14772}{14827}And you know,|not a bad idea.
{14829}{14881}Unfortunately, though,|it turns out...
{14883}{14969}they call it|the "worldwide web'' for a reason.
{14971}{15045}- That's your ass.|- Forget that.
{15046}{15109}What about the CBA?|What about the Globetrotters?
{15110}{15182}- I mean, something.|- Globetrotters. That'd be fun.
{15184}{15258}No. Nobody wants you,|not even the Clippers.
{15260}{15370}- I thought you were my friend, Lorne.|- See, now, that's a problem.
{15372}{15456}I'm not your friend.|I'm your agent.
{15490}{15569}I was your agent.|That also is null and void.
{15571}{15618}Wait.|What are you saying?
{15619}{15666}Now you're not|gonna be my agent?
{15667}{15775}Yeah, it's over.|I can't be your agent. That's silly.
{15777}{15830}But I certainly|wish you luck. I do.
{15832}{15917}And here's hoping you|invested your money wisely...
{15918}{16008}- 'cause I don't see any fresh|cash coming in any time soon.|-Ahh.
{16010}{16061}Don't even need|to hear it. Bling.
{16063}{16128}Jamal Jeffries's|got plenty cash.
{16130}{16242}So don't you worry about me.|Okay? Jamal Jeffries is set, baby. Set.
{16607}{16676}Broke? What the hell|do you mean I'm broke?
{16678}{16749}You ain't got|no more money, dog. Chapter 1 1 .
{16750}{16801}Chapter 1 1 ? What happened|to the first ten chapters?
{16803}{16889}- Are you stupid? No money, man.|- Tell me, Mr. Business Manager...
{16890}{16963}- what you been doing with all my money?|- You spent it all.
{16965}{17040}- I spent it all?|- That's right. You spent it all.
{17042}{17088}- I did?|- Maybe you got too many furs.
{17090}{17156}- Why didn't you try to stop me?|- Tried to do that, bro.
{17158}{17208}- You did?|- I sure did.
{17235}{17292}Yo, Tina!
{17294}{17369}Yo, baby, everything|gonna be all right.
{17371}{17409}It sho' is.
{17446}{17493}You still got a little|modeling left in you.
{17494}{17581}It'll be chump change compared|to what I used to bring in...
{17582}{17685}but it'll get us by until the|commissioner comes to his senses.
{17687}{17737}Come on, baby.|Where you at?
{17739}{17793}I'm in the bedroom.|I'll be out in a minute.
{17795}{17878}Yeah, well, come on.|Ain't that much makeup in the world.
{17879}{17926}You know I had|a rough couple of days.
{17927}{17979}You ought to be rubbing|a brother down.
{18043}{18084}The Banshees.
{18086}{18169}- Losing all control.|-And they're back.
{18171}{18240}I'm prepare to rumble.|Are you?
{18242}{18310}- Get your tickets today.|- I'll rumble with you.
{18312}{18390}I'll rumble with you|all night long.
{18392}{18488}- Women's basketball. What a joke.|-Jamal, I'm leaving.
{18490}{18580}Okay. While you're out, why don't you|pick a brother up something to eat.
{18582}{18628}I'm--
{18660}{18736}Baby, what you doing?|That's the good luggage.
{18738}{18808}Don't make it easy on 'em.|Put this--
{18810}{18870}- What is that?|- My stuff. I'm leaving you.
{18872}{18922}What do you mean|you leaving?
{18924}{19019}The only reason why I stayed|with your lyin', cheatin' ass...
{19021}{19068}is because you were|rich and famous.
{19070}{19153}- But now you're neither,|so what's the point?|- What are you talking about?
{19154}{19229}What about all the good lovin'|you was getting up in here?
{19230}{19321}I packed it. The batteries too.|Good-bye, Jamal.
{19322}{19420}Go ahead. Go ahead.|Yeah, you try to come back...
{19422}{19468}you're gonna have to start|at the bottom of the list.
{19470}{19524}Yeah,yeah,yeah.|That's why I'm leaving your broke ass.
{19526}{19577}Yeah, plus your feet stink!
{19579}{19647}All right, listen to me. You wanna|win this thing, it's real simple.
{19648}{19727}You go inside and you act|like an adult. That's all.
{19729}{19790}If you forget what that is, just look|around the room at everybody else.
{19792}{19870}Hold on here.|I am calm, Loren. I am cool.
{19872}{19972}And I am ready to collect my checks.|Damn, I look good.
{19974}{20090}Mr. Jeffries, you have clearly|embarrassed the league, your team...
{20092}{20169}and I certainly hope you've|embarrassed yourself.
{20171}{20233}What is it you're here|to say to me today?
{20265}{20325}Uh, I'm here|to say that--
{20380}{20468}I'm here to say that--
{20470}{20552}that what I did|was wrong, and, uh...
{20554}{20606}I sincerely, uh--
{20608}{20710}I am--|I'm sincerely--
{20712}{20790}He apologizes, sir.|He is very apologetic.
{20792}{20857}This is not your arbitration|hearing, Mr. Daniels.
{20859}{20906}May I remind you|it's your client's.
{20908}{20981}He is the one|with the oversized ego...
{20982}{21069}that may be eclipsing|his talent at this point.
{21070}{21193}- Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-hold,|Colonel Sanders. Hold on.|- Mm!
{21194}{21290}Excuse me. "Oversized ego|eclipsing his talent?''
{21292}{21352}Perhaps you haven't seen|my game in a while, Pops.
{21354}{21428}Maybe you need to trim|some of them mother-- |bushes off your--  head.
{21430}{21497}You'd be able to see|my mother-- game.|Don't try to give me no shit.
{21662}{21758}- Take that. What you got, baby?|- I'm gonna show you what I got.
{21760}{21825}I'm gonna show you|what I got right now.
{21826}{21872}You still|ain't saying nothing.
{21908}{21974}- Ooh!
{21976}{22032}Jamal, you|holding up the game.
{22059}{22122}- Here.|- Esther.
{22124}{22189}Uh, Esther,|it's on you.
{22191}{22289}- Come on, You old biddy.|play your card.|- This bra is killing me.
{22290}{22376}You's a fine-lookin'|young man.
{22378}{22402}Ooh!
{22516}{22546}Damn!
{22642}{22721}Okay, that's it. I've--|I've had enough of the bridge club.
{22722}{22769}You ain't playing no more?
{22770}{22842}No, no. Oh. I need to go|outside for some air.
{22843}{22878}Why, J.J.?
{22879}{22955}There's a CNN report|that says...
{22957}{23033}too much inside air|is-is deadly.
{23035}{23097}While you're going outside...
{23098}{23169}make yourself useful and pick up|some groceries for the morning.
{23170}{23222}I ain't gonna fetch|no groceries.
{23224}{23272}I don't do that|no more, Aunt Ruby.
{23274}{23350}I'm a professional|ballplayer. I'm a star.
{23352}{23404}You a what?
{23455}{23498}You heard me. I'm a star.
{23500}{23564}Okay, okay, okay, okay.
{23566}{23625}Hurry back with|them groceries, star.
{23627}{23681}Gonna talk back to me|in my own house.
{23682}{23735}Your house? I was the one|bought you the house.
{23737}{23821}You better get|out of here. Crazy ass.
{24191}{24238}- Man, what happened?|- What you doing?
{24239}{24278}Can't pass.
{24280}{24344}Hey, y'all,|it's Jamal Jeffries.
{24391}{24505}- Can I have your autograph?|- Yeah. Sure, kid.
{24507}{24578}- Where's your stupid stamp?|- Ooh!
{24579}{24620}- What?|- You heard me.
{24622}{24684}Thought you were hot stuff,|didn't you? But look at you now.
{24686}{24734}Look where your nasty|attitude's gotten you.
{24736}{24777}- Girl, I'll take this--|- Whatever.
{24778}{24870}Why don't you just go ahead and pass me|the ball, if you still know how.
{24872}{24921}Ooh! Ooh!
{24922}{24970}- Yeah.|- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

{27599}{27712}Um, I'm, um, trying on|your clothes, Aunt Ruby.
{27714}{27788}Yeah, I gather that,|but what are you doing?
{27790}{27893}I know this look freaky, Aunt Ruby,|but it's not what you think.
{27894}{27993}Well, it can't get much better|than what I think.
{28134}{28191}Jamal, there's no way|I'm helping you do this.
{28193}{28266}- Aunt Ruby-- Aunt Ruby, please.|- Mm-mmm.
{28268}{28333}Boy, get up off your knees|in my pants.
{28335}{28382}Aunt Ruby!
{28383}{28446}Jamal, when you were|in the sixth grade...
{28448}{28534}who was there for you when you|traded your little baby cousin...
{28536}{28606}- for a new pair ofbasketball shoes?|- You were there, Aunt Ruby.
{28607}{28654}You were there for me,|but I need you.
{28655}{28721}I was there, helped you through it,|didn't ask no questions...
{28722}{28777}didn't pass|no judgments, but this--
{28779}{28831}Boy, don't you give me|them puppy dog eyes.
{28833}{28913}- Aunt Ruby, you have to help me.|You got to help me.|- Uh-uh. Jamal, no!
{29069}{29125}Are you watching?|Are you watching?
{29242}{29335}Good shot. Good shot. That's what I'm|talking about. Way to break it down.
{29337}{29444}Lorne, practice is almost over. I think|your blind date just stood you up.
{29446}{29527}Looks that way, Jennifer.|Coach. Sorry.
{29529}{29659}Listen. It's all my fault. I trusted|somebody. I should've known better--
{29781}{29840}- I'm here!|- Hold up.
{29881}{29938}Uh, Latisha.
{29965}{30005}Guard her.

{30096}{30137}Girl, I chase chickens|quicker than you.

{30200}{30253}- Just keep your eyes on me.|- Come on with it.
{30273}{30327}There you go.
{30329}{30373}Boom!

{30498}{30545}And... boom!

{30754}{30801}Too easy.
{30844}{30890}- Yeah.|- Where did you find her?
{30892}{30938}I heard about her|from a friend.
{30975}{31025}- Ball!|- I got her!
{31088}{31133}Damn.
{31134}{31197}You made me miss.|That's blocking.
{31199}{31264}What? Oh, please.|You got to be kidding me.
{31266}{31336}She made me miss it.|Blocking.
{31338}{31443}Ladies, that's it. Nicejob.|We'll see you tomorrow.
{31445}{31501}Uh, so, why don't|you call me in the morning...
{31503}{31563}and maybe we can|work something out.
{31565}{31622}Yeah. Thanks, Coach.

{31708}{31770}- I don't know myself. What is it?|- Let's get pizza. You wanna?
{31772}{31824}- Ju-- Juwanna.|- Juwanna?
{31826}{31896}- Yes. Juwanna, man.|- Juwanna Mann, Coach Rivers.
{31898}{31983}- It's great to meet you.|- Nice to meet you, Coach.
{31985}{32025}- You all right?|- Yo, I'm straight.
{32026}{32099}- No, you not.|- And you must be Lorne.|- That's right.
{32101}{32147}- Jamal's told me so much about you.|- Really?
{32149}{32201}Didn't tell me|you were so cute though.
{32262}{32313}Juwanna!
{32314}{32390}How's my favorite girl?|Come on in. Sit down.
{32392}{32498}- Oh, why, thank you, Mr. Daniels.|- Please, call me Lorne.
{32499}{32589}You should be on a first-name basis with|the man who's about to change your life.
{32591}{32646}- Oh, really? Gonna change my life?|-Absolutely.
{32648}{32742}I don't know how I did it.|Well, that's not completely true.
{32744}{32821}This here is a one-year contract|for you with the Charlotte Banshees.
{32822}{32879}- Oh, my Lord, are you kidding me?|- No.
{32881}{32961}- Oh, my Lord!|- Mm-hmm.
{32962}{33017}- Am I dreaming?|- No, you're not dreaming.
{33019}{33066}Go ahead.|Pinch yourself. I'll wait.
{33067}{33122}This is the first time in my life|I've ever been speechless.
{33124}{33170}That is the beauty|of signing a contract.
{33172}{33279}There's no speech really required.|So just go ahead and sign there.
{33281}{33349}Don't I need to get a lawyer to take|a look at this thing before I sign it?
{33350}{33449}Of course not. These contracts are|completely standard at this point.
{33451}{33525}All the hard work's been done by me.|Just go ahead and sign.
{33578}{33626}I guess it's better|than playing in the parks.
{33628}{33679}- It certainly is. Right here.|- Right here?
{33681}{33726}And here. And here.
{33728}{33831}Juwanna. Juwanna. Juwanna.
{33833}{33906}That's a lovely signature.|Congratulations, Juwanna.
{33908}{33993}You are about to become|the newest member...
{33995}{34061}of the Charlotte Banshees.
{34063}{34145}- Whee-ee.
{34146}{34197}I am so excited.
{34199}{34261}All in one day I'm|starting a whole new life...
{34263}{34310}and I have my very own|big-time agent.
{34311}{34397}Oh, I don't want you|to just think of me as your agent.
{34398}{34445}I'm also your friend.
{34446}{34531}Oh, that is so sweet, Lorne.
{34569}{34635}And I don't want you to only think|of me as just your client...
{34637}{34722}because I am also|your ex-client, biatch.
{34724}{34792}- Got you, didn't I?|- Oh, shit.
{34794}{34842}Give me the fax.|Give it to me.
{34844}{34935}- Give it to me. Give it to me. Come on.|- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
{34937}{34993}Mr. Daniels. Mr.--
{34994}{35111}- Give it to me.|- Mr. Daniels. Mr. Daniels.
{35113}{35181}- Your wife is on line three.|- Tell her I'm with a client, will you?
{35182}{35242}Okey-dokey.
{35243}{35329}- God, this is great!|- Uh-huh.
{35330}{35394}- Got your ass. Got your ass.|- Betty. Betty. Betty!
{35396}{35510}I want you to get Coach Rivers on|the line immediately, as in right now.
{35512}{35565}All right, okay.
{35566}{35637}When Coach Rivers gets on the phone,|tell her the whole truth.
{35638}{35717}Okay. I will. I'll tell her.|I'll say, "Coach Rivers, yeah--
{35718}{35799}"The only way Lorne could make money|offi me was to dress me up like this...
{35801}{35865}and trick you|into signing me.''
{35866}{35926}That's not at all the truth.|I had nothing to do with this.
{35927}{35975}What do you mean you had|nothing to do with it?
{35977}{36066}All I did was tell you|about a phenomenal basketball|player, and what did you do?
{36068}{36159}You set up the tryouts,|you negotiated the contract,|you brokered the deal, baby.
{36161}{36237}You kind of created me.|You're Frankenstein.
{36238}{36293}Oh, God.
{36294}{36377}No, no, no.|No, this is crazy.
{36378}{36437}- No one's gonna believe you're a woman.|- You did.
{36521}{36638}- This is blackmail.|- No, it's not. This is black fe-male.
{36640}{36714}- That's not funny.|- What do you expect me to do?
{36716}{36773}Basketball is the only thing|I really know how to do.
{36774}{36822}And I have to make a living.
{36824}{36880}So until you figure out how|to get me back with my team...
{36882}{36949}you can just look for me|in the women's locker room, baby.
{36950}{37031}The women's locker room,|checking out booties.
{37033}{37086}Checking out booties.
{37088}{37147}- Basketball booties.|- Jamal.
{37187}{37265}I thought|we were friends.
{37267}{37317}Oh. Now, see,|there's a problem.
{37352}{37430}You're not my friend, Lorne.|Remember?
{37432}{37478}You're my agent.
{37480}{37571}Thanks to you, Lorne,|I'm gonna be a Charlotte Banshee.
{37573}{37649}You're better|than Jerry Maguire.
{37687}{37743}Somebody kill me!
{37746}{37817}- Y'all ready for this?
{37818}{37890}- Who's ready to play?|Who's ready to win?|- Banshees!
{37892}{37914}- Ban--|- Shees!
{37916}{37962}- Ban--|- Shees!
{38145}{38205}Banshees.
{38263}{38333}It's the opening game|of the WUBA season.
{38334}{38389}Hi. Welcome inside|the Charlotte Coliseum.
{38391}{38453}Along with Jeanne Zelasko,|I'm Chris Myers.
{38455}{38502}We have a terrific matchup|for you today.
{38503}{38600}The Charlotte Banshees hosting|the two-time defending champion,|Houston Gallop.
{38602}{38679}With all-stars in the lineup like|Michelle Langford and Natalie Kemper...
{38681}{38783}you have to believe the Banshees have|a great shot at beating the Gallop.
{38868}{38914}Jamal.
{39016}{39125}- Jamal.
{39126}{39188}- Juwanna.|- Lorne.
{39190}{39239}Ladies and gentlemen, please rise...
{39241}{39297}for the singing|of our national anthem.
{39298}{39405}Singing for us today is multi-platinum|recording artist, Romeo.
{39407}{39479} Oh, say 
{39481}{39593} Can you see 
{39621}{39704} By the dawn's 
{39731}{39781} Early light 
{39783}{39837}You don't understand how excited I am.|My very first game.
{39839}{39901}I saw television cameras. Did you know|this game is being televised?
{39903}{39953}I sure did, and I'm still trying|to figure out what's my best side.
{39955}{40002}- Here or my ass.|- I think--
{40044}{40128} At the twilight's 
{40130}{40201} Last gleaming 
{40202}{40283}- Promise me you'll try to fit in.|- I will try to fit in.
{40285}{40373}All right.|There is no dunking in this league.
{40374}{40434}I won't dunk.|I promise. Relax.
{40435}{40493}It's not like I need to anyway.|I got to go. Now, keep your head up.
{40494}{40541}Yeah. Keep your boobs up.
{40542}{40601}For you.
{40602}{40642}- For my baby.|- How sweet.
{40644}{40718}- See you after the game?|- No doubt, baby.
{40720}{40801}That boy drop more shit|than the bunny rabbit on Ex-Lax.
{40802}{40915}But she's so blind she can't see past|his great, big ol' walking stick.
{40917}{40977}Ain't that right, girl?
{40979}{41026}- What's up, player?|- What's up, player player?
{41027}{41074}Give me some, player.|What's the deal, baby?
{41075}{41130}I'm just a squirrel in your world.|I see you're doing your thing.
{41132}{41247}- You're looking at something.|- Man, hot dogs and hamburgers, man.
{41249}{41320}She's all that and a baseball bat|and a hot wheel track.
{41322}{41385}I'm telling you,|brown sugar like D'Angelo.
{41386}{41455} Brown Sugar |That's what he was|talking about-- right there.
{41500}{41575}Oh! She gonna|block me out, huh?
{41577}{41635}-She with it though.|- I know she with it.
{41637}{41689}Yeah, baby.
{41691}{41738}Drop it like it's hot.
{41888}{41922}All right! Yeah!
{42398}{42477}That's all right, girl.|We get it next time, Natalie.
{42478}{42509}Hit. Two shots.
{42511}{42635}Yeah, that's a nice girl there.|She a little naive though.
{42637}{42713}Foreigner.|Here on a visa from Oklahoma.
{42715}{42771}She gonna be|a city girl before long.
{42773}{42829}She rooming with Sanchez.
{42830}{42899}That little hot tamale|over there.
{42901}{42945}That girl get around.
{42947}{42995}Really?
{43038}{43089}How awful. Awful.
{43091}{43148}Block out, Magda.
{43150}{43211}With that big-ass head,|she could block out the sun.
{43213}{43289}I said block out,|you Serbian knucklehead!
{43331}{43422}- Way to go!|- So, what's your story?
{43424}{43493}Me? I like|to keep it simple.
{43495}{43572}You give me a good book|and a good bitch, I'm straight.
{43574}{43620}I like you.
{43622}{43690}Yes, Natalie. Way to get in there.
{43797}{43850}Time out!
{43963}{44041}- Come on, Natalie!|- All right, Natalie!
{44115}{44154}All right, hotshot.
{44156}{44266}- Let's see what you got.|- All right, Coach. Now you're coaching.
{44268}{44343}There has been a substitution,|and the new player is number 22.
{44345}{44396}Chris, that is Juwanna Mann.
{44470}{44537}- Yo, you see that?|- That deserves a "wow.''
{44538}{44598}Wrong. Na-na-na-na.
{44600}{44654}Beer and a popcorn.
{44656}{44734}It's all right. Okay.
{44736}{44802}The ball is stolen away.|What a move.
{44804}{44840}No! No! No!
{44842}{44881}Pass the ball!
{44883}{44918}Don't dunk!
{45033}{45130}The 360.|Another amazing shot.
{45132}{45191}Ain't nothing sexier|than a woman with ball control.
{45258}{45294}All right! Yes!
{45295}{45361}Pass the ball!|Pass the ball!
{45362}{45419}- Here I go. Here I go. You ready?|- Ball! Ball!
{45421}{45468}It's mine! Mine!
{45470}{45518}22, Offense.
{45520}{45571}22, hit.
{45598}{45637}Technical right here.
{45690}{45750}If y'all hadn't been playing|like a bunch of little girls.
{45826}{45913}Coach, that girl has got to go. You|know she's the reason we lost the game.
{45915}{46026}- She wouldn't even let|the ground touch the ball.|- I understand your frustration.
{46028}{46091}The woman has|definitely got problems.
{46093}{46197}You got that right. Her number-one|problem is I'm not playing with her.
{46199}{46262}You're gonna have to.|We just got Natalie's MRI back.
{46264}{46314}She tore her ACL.|She's out for the rest of the season.
{46316}{46397}And I'm making Juwanna|her replacement.
{46398}{46478}What? But she's nothing|but a ball hog, Coach.
{46480}{46555}You're gonna talk to me about ball hog,|"Miss I Got Game, I'm All That''?
{46557}{46640}- I wasn't as bad as her.|- Michelle, you need to step up.
{46642}{46750}You're captain of this team,|and I'm expecting you to help me|turn this woman around.
{46854}{46962}I'm in a messy situation. I'm stuck,|and, basically, we have no choice.
{47265}{47314}That was quite a performance|you had out there today.
{47316}{47371}What, 1 5 points|in the second half alone.
{47373}{47468}It was, but it would've been 1 6 if y'all|would have just picked up the pace.
{47470}{47538}Listen to me. I know I'm not|the captain of this team yet.
{47540}{47619}But you guys wanna win, you're gonna|have to find a way to get me the ball.
{47621}{47701}- What?|- I can't pass the thing to myself.
{47702}{47767}I probably could if I worked at it,|but we're supposed to be a team.
{47769}{47845}- Teamwork. Just what|we need to talk about.|- That's right.
{47934}{47981}Forget it.
{48155}{48262}Look. You know, I'd love to work with|you on your game, if you're up to it.
{48263}{48321}Go over the playbook|with you...
{48323}{48377}make sure you understand|how the Banshees--
{48379}{48482}How you gonna work with me on my game|when my game doesn't need any work?
{48484}{48537}Didn't you see it?
{48538}{48593}But I'll be more than happy to help you|with a few pointers on your game.
{48594}{48669}I'll be really happy to do that--|Oh, my God. Lord, what are you doing?
{48671}{48726}Taking a shower, Einstein.|Aren't you?
{48728}{48817}Hell, yes, I'll take a shower with--|shower soon as I get home.
{48819}{48914}I got to do it as soon as I get home.|I really can't take showers in public.
{48916}{48977}Things crawl up in you|and you never find them.
{48979}{49027}Whatever.
{49194}{49246}Boy, I love this league.
{49309}{49375}What part of"don't draw attention|to yourself' did you not understand?
{49377}{49475}Lorne, I'm sorry. They were screaming|and cheering for a brother-- a sister.
{49477}{49527}What was I supposed to do?|Play like a bitch?
{49529}{49589}Yes, play like a woman.|That was your plan.
{49591}{49651}- Calm down. Chill out, man.|- You're right. I got to calm down.
{49653}{49699}I'm overreacting.|Absolutely.
{49701}{49803}I'm not used to going to a game|and praying that my client's|boobs don't fall out!
{49805}{49891}You keep this up, I'm gonna be|booking clowns at birthday parties.
{49893}{49981}That's your problem. My problem is I|need a shower. I sweat more as a woman.
{50068}{50106}Jamal, please.
{50108}{50167}I'm fairly certain|I can get you an arbitration hearing.
{50169}{50257}But until then, I need you to keep|a low profile. That's all.
{50258}{50305}- Okay.|- Can you do that?
{50306}{50353}I can do that, Lorne.|I'll keep a low profile. I promise.
{50354}{50401}Damn, you're gonna have a heart attack|if you keep that shit up.
{50402}{50495}- Yeah.|- I'm telling you. Bye-bye, Lorne.
{50556}{50634}What a snake. I knew it.
{50798}{50849}- Holler at ya.|- I'll holler at you too.
{50998}{51046}- Hold up, little girl.|Let me tell you something.|- Ooh!
{51048}{51094}You are one tall|glass of water...
{51096}{51197}and I'm telling you|"scraight'' up, I'm thirsty.
{51199}{51246}- What in the hell are you?|- You don't know who I am, do you?
{51248}{51365}- No, I don't. Who are you?|- I am Puff Smokey Smoke.
{51366}{51413}You wanna kiss it,|don't you?
{51414}{51505}That's right. Uh-huh.|Rap extraordinaire.
{51507}{51566}I also sang background|on Romeo's last album...
{51568}{51617}"Where There's Smoke|There's Firestone.''
{51619}{51655} Watch|the Firestone tires 
{51657}{51738}Oh, really? Well, you can sing|backup for me right now.
{51740}{51818}Just back right on up. Thank you very|much, Mr. Puffer, but I have to go.
{51820}{51869}Drive careful now, baby...
{51871}{51925}'cause you are|definitely precious cargo.
{52062}{52099}You ready? You ready?
{52169}{52261}Pass the ball. Juwanna!
{52263}{52383}Juwanna. What the hell are you doing?
{52385}{52434}Well, I'm sweating.|I'm breaking down the defense.
{52436}{52490}I'm wearing these chumps out,|making all the shots. Take your pick.
{52623}{52751}You know what? Practice is over.|Michelle, don't leave. Stick around.
{52753}{52824}This is about you|and Juwanna.
{52925}{52971}Listen, missy.
{52973}{53086}I want you to take a look up here|and tell me what you see.
{53088}{53165}What I see are a bunch of empty bleaches|that I'm about to help you fill.
{53166}{53273}- That's what I see.|- Very funny. You're a funny lady.
{53275}{53343}I see a sign that says|the Charlotte Banshees.
{53345}{53394}My eyes are fine, Coach.
{53396}{53466}Because it says|the Charlotte Banshees...
{53468}{53545}and not|the Charlotte Ju-wanna.
{53546}{53651}And if the Charlotte Banshees are gonna|have any chance of winning this season...
{53653}{53719}I have to get my two strongest|players here to try and work together.
{53721}{53789}Otherwise, we're screwed.
{53823}{53885}So, you're gonna play|with Michelle here...
{53886}{53922}one-on-one...
{53924}{54002}and one-on-one|and one-on-one and one-on-one.
{54004}{54099}Hey, how about one-on-one?
{54101}{54181}Until you start to get|with the program. You got it?
{54287}{54341}Yeah, I got it, Coach.
{54419}{54466}Mm!
{54467}{54528}- You ready for this?|- What you got? Come on.
{54593}{54671}- You're gonna need a pen and paper.|- That's all right. Come on.
{54673}{54719}- Are you ready?|- What you got?
{54721}{54860}Ooh! Boom!|Sorry about that. Oh!
{54862}{54917}Now, that's what|I call an ass-ist.
{54919}{54959}Ha ha.
{54961}{55034}Ooh! Boom!
{55036}{55088}That's game.
{55090}{55169}You really think|you're something, don't you?
{55171}{55221}Well, I got it going on.|What can I say? Born with it.
{55223}{55281}Here we go. The jokes.|Look, Juwanna...
{55282}{55346}this might be a joke to you,|but it's not to me.
{55377}{55451}You got some big balls,|don't you, girl?
{55453}{55533}Yeah, yeah, but all your arrogance|and all of that showboatin'...
{55534}{55601}that doesn't scare me,|'cause I know it's just a cover.
{55602}{55685}Because underneath, you don't trust|anybody but yourself, girl.
{55687}{55735}And that's exactly where you|gonna end up, by yourself...
{55737}{55814}if you don't start|to trust your team.
{55816}{55878}And we'll be right back|with more of Oprah. Are you done?
{55880}{55917}No.
{55919}{56002}Don't get me wrong.|You got mad skills. You're good.
{56003}{56065}But one player can't|win games by themselves.
{56067}{56114}We need teamwork.
{56232}{56308}- So you think I got skills?|- Yeah.
{56310}{56365}I'd like to be able to do some|of them moves I saw you do.
{56366}{56442}- Wrap around.|- I'd sure like to show you|some of them moves.
{56444}{56522}- What?|- I sure could show you|some of those moves.
{56524}{56598}- It's real easy.|- Good. See, now we talking.
{56600}{56610}I have never seen anybody pick up|some moves quicker than you.
{56610}{56677}I have never seen anybody pick up|some moves quicker than you.
{56679}{56744}- You were stormin'.|- Well, you know. You know.
{56746}{56812}- Romeo! Hey!|- What's up, girl?
{56814}{56850}What you doing?
{56852}{56910}I couldn't roll through Atlanta|without my baby.
{56912}{56984}- Juwanna, I got a ride.|- All right. Bye-bye.
{56986}{57021}Bye.
{57023}{57069}You have some trouble there,|little lady?
{57071}{57140}My door's just stuck.|You go right ahead. I can handle this.
{57142}{57224}- I don't want you to strain yourself.|- That's what you get.
{57226}{57273}I guess you don't need|no man's help after all.
{57274}{57325}- No, I don't need a man, but thank you.|- It's like that. All right.
{57326}{57395}Hey, Juwanna, You wanna hang out|tomorrow before our trip to New York?
{57397}{57446}- Oh, I'd love to.|- Cool.
{57448}{57497}-Just you and me, right?|- Yeah.
{57499}{57553}- It's a date.|- All right.
{57555}{57609}What's up, baby?
{57701}{57758}- See you later.|- Bye.
{57796}{57874}I can't stand him. Bam!
{57876}{57951}- I got a little surprise for you.|- What is it? I love surprises.
{57953}{58069}You do? Good. Because I have booked us|for an entire day of beauty at the spa.
{58070}{58117}Spa?
{58150}{58196}So relaxing.
{58234}{58318}- I'm looking forward to this.|- Mm-hmm.
{58320}{58403}I'm looking forward to it too.|I'm feeling relaxed already.
{58405}{58445}Hi.
{58446}{58494}Oh, yes.
{58495}{58582}Where did you|leave your wings, you angel you?
{58619}{58723}Oh, my God.|Lord. Who are you?
{58755}{58804}Slow it down now. Oh!

{59642}{59688}Yes. Bye, Susie.
{59690}{59725}So, how you feeling?
{59727}{59811}Oh, Lord, girl, if I was any number,|I think I'd be dead.
{59813}{59899}Get a good night's sleep.|We got that 7:00 a.m. flight|in the morning to New York.
{59901}{59980}Don't worry about me.|My alarm's set, sweetie, right here.
{59982}{60045}- Right here.|- Good.

{61813}{61912}Well, see, actually, Officer,|my speedometer is broken on this car.
{61914}{62015}And I was looking at it, but--|How fast was I going?
{62017}{62078}- I clocked you at 50.|- Is that a little too fast?
{62080}{62145}- I'm gonna have to see your license.|- Oh, Lord.
{62147}{62197}You really think|we need to go that far?
{62199}{62289}I'm not even sure if it's in this car.|I might have left it in my other car.|It's a Benz.
{62291}{62353}Well, you better have it or I'm|gonna have to impound this car...
{62354}{62445}- and you and I are going|for a little ride.|- Where we going?

{63624}{63659}Come on. Spin around.
{63705}{63761}- All right. How about this?|- All the way.
{63943}{64031}You look fabulous.|I'm having it done too.

{64103}{64153}Well, whoever it was,|they did a great job.
{64155}{64217}I got my post-op outfit all ready|and waiting, hanging in my closet.
{64218}{64280}- It's got little ruffles on top.|- Excuse me. Thank you very much.
{64282}{64353}Officer, trust me. I believe you're|gonna look great when you get it done.

{66721}{66765}Less than one minute old 
{66766}{66818}Great shot. Great shot.
{66820}{66861}I never thought 
{66862}{66921} Through love we'd be 
{66923}{67006}Making one|as lovely as she

{67282}{67328}Squeeze.
{67330}{67404}A little breakdown,|go right...
{67406}{67457}and squeeze.
{67458}{67507}Let's win this thing.|On three.
{67509}{67555}One, two, three!
{67599}{67695}Isn't she lovely 
{67697}{67727}Made from love

{67886}{67963} Truly the angel's best 
{67965}{68016}- Whoo!|-I can't believe 
{68018}{68088} What God has done 
{68125}{68214}Ladies, listen up.|I got a couple of things to say here.
{68216}{68250}First of all, uh...
{68290}{68343}you guys played|one hell of a game tonight.
{68375}{68471}I hope there's plenty more|where that came from.
{68473}{68525}For those of you who are new to the|Banshees, we have a little tradition.
{68526}{68587}- After every victory--
{68589}{68625}That's right--
{68627}{68713}we give away a game ball, and tonight it|should come as no surprise...
{68714}{68808}that the ball goes to...|Juwanna Mann.
{68810}{68893}Yeah. Good game,|Juwanna.
{68895}{68982}- Hey, Juwanna, kick it out. I'm open.
{68984}{69073}Thank you, guys.|I really do appreciate it.
{69074}{69134}Oh, look at her getting|all misty up in here.
{69136}{69194}I really do. I mean it.
{69196}{69256}But I think that since Magda|actually made the winning shot...
{69258}{69311}I think I should|share this with her.
{69338}{69393}You share ball with me?
{69395}{69492}Oh, thank you, Juwanna.|Thank you.
{69494}{69592}- Oh, no, you don't have to--|- Thank you. Thank you.
{69594}{69709}Precious time. Let's shower up|and get the hell out of here.
{69710}{69757}Good job, ladies.
{69758}{69805}Nice work there.
{70106}{70185}It's just superstition.|Never take it off after a win.
{70187}{70233}Never take it off.
{70391}{70493}You was really getting|your game on tonight, Juwanna.
{70494}{70578}I have a feeling that we're gonna have|a really good season this year.
{70580}{70664}Oh, yes, we are.|Whoa! Look at you.
{70666}{70732}Isn't this cute?|I got it at Victoria's Secret.
{70734}{70780}Mm-hmm.
{70782}{70858}Whew. Well,|the secret's out.
{70860}{70925}It's just perfect|for the road,you know?
{70926}{70997}You can just keep it|comfy and simple.
{70998}{71067}Mm-hmm.|Comfy and simple.
{71150}{71220}Damn. I am so sore tonight.
{71222}{71320}- Really?|- Would you mind rubbing|a bit of this on my shoulders?
{71322}{71393}Oh! Mm-hmm.
{71394}{71485}- I'll be more than happy to. Yeah.|- Thank you, girl.
{71487}{71598}- Yes. All right.|We can do that for each other.|- Thank you.
{71600}{71657}We was really|balling tonight, huh?
{71659}{71729}- Mm-hmm.|- Such teamwork.
{71731}{71781}Mm-hmm.
{71783}{71871}Ooh. That feels good.
{71873}{71931}Yes, that was one...
{71933}{71997}velvety smooth game.
{71998}{72089}I just get so stiff sometimes|after the game. Do you?
{72091}{72157}- I'm starting to.|- Hmm?
{72159}{72210}I'm starting to get stiff|right here. Right there.
{72212}{72258}- It's catching up with you?|- Mm-hmm.
{72288}{72337}- Thanks, girl. I appreciate it.|- My pleasure.
{72339}{72405}- You want me to put|a little bit on you?|- Where? No.
{72406}{72517}I'm fine. I'm just cool.|I'll just sit here and hit the old hay.
{72569}{72657}Good night, Mr. Romeo.
{72719}{72756}You just so fine.
{72758}{72829}- Don't leave home without him, huh?|- You got that right.
{72831}{72880}He goes wherever I go.
{72882}{72964}You think Romeo takes your picture|when he goes on the road?
{72966}{73041}Hell, I'm sure of it. I glued it|to the inside of his suitcase.
{73082}{73162}I'm just saying, uh,|I know Romeo's a man...
{73164}{73227}and I do know men,|if you know what I mean.
{73229}{73317}All I'm saying is, girl,|I trust my man.
{73318}{73373}Do you love him?
{73448}{73537}Look, Juwanna, I've never|not had someone, and...
{73538}{73638}even with the doubts, which I'm|not gonna lie, there are some...
{73640}{73715}it's better than being alone.
{73717}{73793}I'm not so sure|about that, Michelle.
{74027}{74073}Oh, wow.
{74075}{74123}Look at these tomatoes.|They're looking good, Aunt Ruby.
{74125}{74184}Uh-huh.|Hey, baby, how did it go?
{74186}{74269}It went great, Aunt Ruby. The game|was off the hook. I was off the hook.
{74270}{74333}They gave me the game ball.|And, Aunt Ruby...
{74334}{74437}I really think Michelle and I--|we're getting tight.
{74439}{74499}Oh! You like her,|do you?
{74501}{74573}Yeah, yeah.|Yeah, I think I do.
{74575}{74647}- And she likes you?|- Well, she will.

{74874}{74967}- What?|- You a man posing as a woman.
{74969}{75069}She don't want you.|She wants a girlfriend.
{75070}{75171}The second she find out you got a extra|piece of equipment between your legs...
{75173}{75219}what you think|she gonna do?
{75597}{75669}Juwanna, I have been looking|all over for you.
{75671}{75738}We've got a table|right over there.
{75740}{75812}What's the matter?|You don't like my outfit, huh?
{75814}{75860}I told my girl|this Pebbles do--

{76241}{76316}Oh. I'm sorry, girl.|Same to you. You looking good, girl.
{76318}{76373}- That's what I thought.|- Puff gonna love you in that dress.
{76374}{76441}- What? "Puff'? I don't smoke.|- Puff. You remember.
{76443}{76511}Over there.|Romeo's friend?
{76513}{76593}- You remember him. Look.|- Oh, my Lord.
{76594}{76661}You did not just set me on a date|with that Carolina river cricket.
{76663}{76728}- I thought I was doing you a favor.|- You call that a favor?
{76730}{76811}- He really likes you, girl.|- He can start liking somebody else.
{76813}{76917}- I'm up out of here.|- Juwanna, please don't leave.
{76919}{76973}I promised to Romeo|that I'd hook you guys up...
{76975}{77047}and it would really mean|a lot to me if you would stay.
{77074}{77130}Please. For me?
{77198}{77245}- Be nice. I found her.|- I'm gonna try my best.

{77585}{77659}- Thank you.|- Let me "ax'' you something.
{77661}{77715}- What do you wanna "ax'' me?|- Did it hurt?
{77717}{77829}- Did what hurt?|- When you... fell from heaven.
{77878}{77952}Hallelujah!|It's called the bird. Watch the wings.
{78030}{78133}Let's have a seat.|Let's have a good evening, huh?
{78135}{78193}I got the chair.|Sit on--
{78259}{78324}Good evening, folks.|Would you like to hear the specials?
{78326}{78407}Don't wanna hear any specials. Just|get me a Cosmos, heavy on the vodka...
{78409}{78471}and just keep pouring 'em and|pouring 'em till your arms get tired.
{78473}{78580}- I'll have a glass of champagne, sir.|- Hold up. Hold up.

{78654}{78749}Yeah,yeah, bet that.|And some "scrawberries'|and some "scrimp'cocktail.
{78750}{78816}Have we decided on dinner|or do you need some more time?
{78818}{78905}- Don't need any more time.|- Ah, ah, ah. Stymie that.
{78907}{78956}That's when you|going country.
{78958}{79025} Country got you crazy 
{79077}{79123}O-7-3-5-7!
{79149}{79208}The young lady wants|a fil-let mig-non.
{79210}{79265}You know, little hunk of meat,|little pink on the inside.
{79290}{79340} Fil-let mig-non 
{79342}{79396} How do you like it|How do you like it 
{79398}{79459}- I'll have the, uh--

{80047}{80090}No, no, no.
{80092}{80149}- Well, the restroom's right back there.|- I can do this.
{82245}{82300}You know, that could|be us out there, right?
{82347}{82405}- Hey, hey, hey!
{82612}{82658}Back your ass up.
{82708}{82768}Yo, Puff, let me holler|at you for a second.

{83637}{83706}- You mind if I got something to drink?|- I ran out.
{83708}{83785}- How about if I use your bathroom?|- It's broken.
{83787}{83843}I'm mighty tired.|You mind if I crash on the couch?
{83845}{83879}Don't have one.
{83881}{83970}- You mind if I use the phone?|- Listen to me. My line's dead.
{83972}{84029}Just cut the crap.|You're not getting into my house.
{84031}{84093}You don't need to come into my house.|You don't need to use the bathroom.
{84095}{84179}You can't sleep on my couch. I don't|need you to checking for any burglars.
{84181}{84232}And I don't have any aspirins|for your fake headache.
{84234}{84325}I'll tell you what. You're not|getting inside of me or my house.
{84327}{84406}So you and little Puffy can just|get to steppin'. Get to steppin'.
{84408}{84485}- How about a little kiss?|- I ain't giving you no little-- Eew!
{84486}{84544}Giving you no little kiss.
{84546}{84649}All right, then, good night. But you|know I could use a little sugar. I--
{84650}{84737}That's what you can use.|That's exactly what you can use.
{84832}{84902}Well, I guess no means no.
{85734}{85815}You're just a big ol' man.|Now give me a big ol' hug.
{85817}{85879}Go right on over there.|Now, what is your name?
{85881}{86019}Jerry, you're gonna get one|"To My Friend Jerry.'' There you are.
{86021}{86067}Juwanna Mann.|What's up?
{86184}{86244}Oh, my God.
{86246}{86292}Aren't you getting dizzy?
{86858}{86920} We rock|the house tonight 
{86922}{86966} The Banshees 
{86968}{87014} We'll have a good ol' time 
{87016}{87069} The Banshees 
{87071}{87128} It feels right|The Banshees 
{87445}{87528}We ain't been here six hours and already|you got some meat sending you flowers.
{87529}{87619}You move that fast on the court,|you'd be league MVP about now.
{87621}{87689}Are you two done?|'Cause they're not even for me.
{87690}{87758}They're for Miss Juwanna.
{87760}{87820}Ooh.
{87822}{87869}Give 'em here|before you wilt 'em.
{87870}{87917}Let's just see|who they from.
{87918}{87965}Can I read|my own card, Lizard?
{87966}{88043}Let's see now.|"Roses are red, violets are not...
{88045}{88104}"I can't wait to see|what you've got.
{88105}{88170}Love, Puff Smokey Smoke.''
{88258}{88338} He your baby's daddy|He your baby's daddy 
{88340}{88386}He's your mother's sister.
{88388}{88426}Oh, Juwanna.
{88428}{88488}Oh, please. Trust me.|Puffy's not my type.
{88490}{88572}Anybody who sends me roses|is definitely my type.
{88574}{88643}Hell, bitch, someone|passes you the salt, he's your type.
{88645}{88706}Lizard, that's cold.
{88708}{88798}I'm gonna tell you ladies|what my type is.
{88800}{88872}Somebody who sends you flowers|for no reason at all. You know?
{88874}{88972}Just because|it's Wednesday or whatever.
{88973}{89059}And that's special.|Yeah.
{89061}{89128}- That's the kind of guy you hold on to.|- Well,you know what I like?
{89130}{89188}I like it|when a man tells you...
{89189}{89245}you're the most|beautiful girl in the world.
{89246}{89336}-Aw, girl.|- Oh, Lord.
{89338}{89403}I hate to burst|your bubble, Mother Teresa...
{89405}{89469}but a man would tell you|anything to tap that ass.
{89470}{89514}You got that right.
{89516}{89576}I'm gonna let you guys in|on a little secret.
{89578}{89624}It's not that I'm easy|or anything.
{89626}{89676}It's just you got|to trust me on this.
{89678}{89739}The key to men is breaking through|that little code they have...
{89741}{89783}that little double-talk.
{89785}{89840}And what about when they take|a baby girl out to dinner...
{89842}{89913}talk about you can eat|whatever you want, money's no object?
{89914}{90017}All that means is, if I'm spending|this kind of money on your gut...
{90019}{90136}when I get home, I want some|of baby girl's-- That's all that is.
{90138}{90215}And y'all all know|the Mack Daddy line of them all.
{90217}{90296}Now, say it with me.|"I promise, baby...
{90298}{90352}I will call you tomorrow.''
{90354}{90417}- Amen, girl!|- Hallelujah!
{90418}{90523}And what about when some men like|to brag about the size of their manhood?
{90525}{90628}When we know it ain't the size of the|boat, baby, but the motion of the ocean.
{90629}{90685}Can I get a "hallelujah''?
{90749}{90785}Can't get a "hallelujah''?
{90858}{90938}What you talking about, Juwanna?|The size of the boat don't matter.
{90981}{91063}- I want the Titanic.|- You got that right!
{91251}{91321}All right, ladies, listen up.|No practice today.
{91322}{91376}Cool! All right!
{91377}{91424}The team has|a new insurance policy...
{91425}{91479}so each one of you needs|to take a new physical.
{91481}{91568}Come on, y'all.|Let's go knock this out real quick.
{91621}{91670}Juwanna Mann?
{91713}{91760}When was your last period?
{91762}{91811}My last period.|Okay, I had a game three days ago...
{91813}{91859}and I played|the whole game.
{91861}{91949}- So two periods.|- Oh, no, no. You crack me up.
{91950}{92040}No, be serious.|Your menstrual period.
{92041}{92091}Oh. Oh. Um-- Um--
{92093}{92148}Menstruation period.|Let's see here.
{92150}{92221}Last Thursday. Yes, I think|I unplugged last Thursday.
{92296}{92396}And any signs of gonorrhea,|syphilis or chlamydia?
{92397}{92479}- Don't have any sisters.|Am I done yet, Doc?|- No, no, no.
{92481}{92588}I need for you to disrobe,|and I'll step right outside...
{92590}{92637}and I'll be back|in just a few minutes.
{92638}{92698}Excuse me. You want me|to take off everything?
{92700}{92750}Every little stitch.
{92993}{93039}Miss Mann.
{93041}{93100}- Everything all right in there?|- I'll be right there, Doc.
{93153}{93204}Miss Mann.
{93323}{93383}I'm coming in, Miss Mann.
{93385}{93431}Bam! I must be|in the wrong locker room.
{93585}{93674}You can't go in there.|Mr. Daniels is a very busy man.
{93676}{93748}Who do you|think you are?
{93791}{93848}Oh. Betty, it's okay.|It's fine. Thank you.
{93849}{93934}Thank you very much, Betty.|Thank you, Betty.
{93936}{94018}Wow. A third career.|Where the hell do you find the time?
{94020}{94067}I'm telling you right now.
{94069}{94133}I'm through.|I'm finished with this. I'm out.
{94135}{94195}- I'm getting out.|- Okay, all right.
{94197}{94249}Have you checked|with Juwanna on that?
{94250}{94309}I don't need to ask Juwanna.|I am Juwanna.
{94311}{94389}I just left a doctor who|was about five minutes away...
{94391}{94440}from a handful|of Juwanna's nuts.
{94442}{94502}All right. I just thought you|might wanna run it by her...
{94504}{94580}because, well, considering all|the offiers I've been flooded with.
{94581}{94640}I don't think you're hearing me.|What do you mean, "offers''?
{94641}{94723}Reebok, Coca-Cola,|Sports Illustrated for Women.
{94725}{94781}Yeah, it turns out|that Juwanna...
{94782}{94850}is every advertiser's|dream come true.
{94852}{94900}She's easy|to get along with...
{94901}{94954}considerate of others,|a real team player...
{94956}{95002}pretty much|everything you're not.
{95004}{95087}So, really, all you have|to do is jump on board...
{95089}{95148}with any one|of these advertisers...
{95149}{95264}you'll be making more money as Juwanna|than you ever dreamed of as Jamal.
{95265}{95327}You're not getting it.|You're just not getting it.
{95329}{95375}I don't care|about all that anymore.
{95377}{95469}Listen. I did this for one reason,|and I did it for one reason only.
{95471}{95546}I did it so Jamal Jeffries|can get back into pro ball, man.
{95548}{95627}I wanna be back with my team,|and that was it. That's it.
{95629}{95714}Then I'll tell you that the network|is pressuring the commissioner...
{95716}{95762}and you're probably|gonna get another hearing.
{95764}{95848}In the meantime, you might consider|taking advantage of the Juwanna train...
{95850}{95908}while the railroad|is still in business.
{95909}{96019}You might wanna stop worrying|about Juwanna so much...
{96021}{96101}and worry about Lorne, 'cause this|is about saving your career too.
{96285}{96335}Romeo.
{96398}{96445}My baby sleeping.
{96446}{96521}- Romeo?
{96523}{96596}- That's my name, baby. That's my name.|- Romeo?
{96598}{96645}Hold on, baby.|I'm almost finished.
{96646}{96708}Romeo!
{96710}{96794}Who are you in my bed?|What are you doing in my house?
{96817}{96869}Baby, hold up.
{96871}{96929}It ain't me. Groupies.
{97091}{97144}Hel--
{97146}{97226}- Hello.|- Juwanna, it's Michelle.
{97228}{97311}- I need to talk to you.|- Girl, why are you crying?
{97472}{97567}I knew you wanted me. I knew it was just|a matter of time, baby. What you want?
{97728}{97813}Six, five, four...
{97815}{97888}three, two, one.
{97890}{97928}Happy New Year!
{97929}{98024}You see that, Michelle? Being alone|doesn't mean you have to be lonely.
{98092}{98188}Juwanna, how come I couldn't see|what Romeo was doing behind my back?
{98189}{98284}It was probably the glare|off Puff Smokey's teeth.
{98317}{98363}I know. I know.
{98365}{98435}- It hurts like crazy now, sweetheart.|- Bad.
{98437}{98546}But you trust me.|You are so much better off.
{98548}{98607}I just hate being wrong.
{98609}{98687}Don't you go blaming yourself|for this. No, you don't.
{98689}{98778}You don't blame yourself|for that low-down dirty snake.
{98780}{98886}Sweetheart, some men just don't realize|what they've got till it's gone.
{98888}{98953}Now, you trust me.
{98955}{99001}One day he's gonna know.
{99033}{99080}Thanks.
{99152}{99208}Juwanna, you are|such a good friend.
{99253}{99333}That's why I like you,|'cause you just keep it real.
{99335}{99408}You know?|No perpetrating with you.
{99409}{99469}You're just you.
{99471}{99532}- Actually, Michelle,|there's something--|- And you know what else?
{99534}{99638}I'm gonna quit all|of this crying and trippin'...
{99640}{99686}and I'm just gonna move on.
{99688}{99767}- That's it. Move right on.|- Yeah. Let's have some more wine.
{99769}{99849}Michelle, I really need|to tell you something.
{99850}{99939}I'm really hoping the playoffs|can take my mind offi of things...
{99941}{100022}'cause you and the team are all|that I plan on focusing on right now.
{100024}{100151}'Cause we got a really good chance|of winning the championship this year.
{100153}{100234}Especially now,|since we got you, dog.
{100472}{100520}Jamal.|Okay, it's all set.
{100521}{100590}Between the network, the players' union|and my shameless groveling...
{100592}{100638}we got you a meeting|with the commissioner.
{100640}{100746}- That's great. What do I have to do?|- Just show up, be polite, smile.
{100748}{100806}Let me do all the talking,|pretty much like I'm doing now...
{100808}{100880}- and you're back in the league.|- Sounds good to me. When is it?
{100881}{100958}- Tomorrow, 3:00.|- Wait a minute, Lorne.
{100960}{101032}You know I can't make that. The Banshees|start the playoffs tomorrow.
{101072}{101158}Well, you know what? How about|if my office tapes the game for you?
{101160}{101208}Yeah, but they're|expecting Juwanna to play.
{101209}{101271}And I'm expecting|Juwanna to disappear.
{101273}{101366}We got a deal here.|What am I busting my ass for?
{101368}{101418}Come on now.|Understand, will you?
{101420}{101488}There's a lot|of people involved.
{101489}{101554}Yeah, Lorne,|including Juwanna.
{101556}{101617}There are a lot of people|counting on Juwanna too.
{101619}{101665}Jamal.
{101667}{101721}You're scaring me now|with this.
{101765}{101814}I just need|a minute, Lorne.
{102104}{102161}The fans are filing in|with great anticipation...
{102163}{102224}as the Charlotte Banshees|prepare to host game one...
{102225}{102308}of their WUBA playoff series|against the Houston Gallop.
{102341}{102411}Yo, has anybody|seen Juwanna?
{102561}{102622}Jeanne, this should really be|an exciting playoff series.
{102624}{102687}You're right, Chris. Even though these|two teams are pretty evenly matched...
{102689}{102748}most people expect the Banshees|to win the series.
{102749}{102809}But in order to do that, they're|gonna need a huge performance...
{102811}{102860}by their star player,|Juwanna Mann.
{102861}{102956}And we're gonna find out for real|when they tip it off|in just about 30 minutes.
{103034}{103094}- Hello.|- Hey, look.
{103096}{103142}It's me.
{103144}{103209}Can we, uh--|Can we reschedule the meeting?
{103210}{103276}No, we don't.|We're not rescheduling the meeting.
{103277}{103324}Let me make this|real clear for you.
{103325}{103393}You're not here in five minutes, you're|not gonna play in the league ever again.
{103394}{103473}This is it.|You understand me? Oh, really?
{103474}{103521}Yeah, I understand.
{103588}{103664}That was him.|He's on his way.
{103665}{103734}Nothing to worry about,|Mr. Commissioner.
{103886}{103933}What's it gonna be, boy?
{104026}{104073}You got to go somewhere.
{104128}{104211}And now introducing|the starting lineup...
{104213}{104278}for your Charlotte Banshees.
{104397}{104460}- I tried calling her.|- I don't believe this.
{104461}{104500}- Where she at?|- I don't know.
{104502}{104585}You know what it is|I'm thinking? Traffic.
{104587}{104630}Yeah, it's, uh--
{104632}{104716}It's always--|Down, you know, here it's bad.
{104718}{104780}Number 22...
{104781}{104899}Juwanna Mann.
{105349}{105409}Hey. Where you been?
{105411}{105475}I had a friend|that had some problems.
{105477}{105536}- Now let's kick some butt.|- All right. Let's do this. Come on.
{105537}{105584}Let's get in here.|Huddle up.
{105585}{105650}I guess some things|never change.
{105823}{105869}No, you're wrong about that.
{105871}{105928}The moment we've been waiting|for is finally here.
{105929}{105958}We are underway.
{106133}{106180}Ball.
{106246}{106293}Go, girls! Yeah!
{106319}{106368}I've lost my mind!
{106405}{106461}- Way to go, Michelle.|- Good pass, baby. Good pass.
{106493}{106545}- Right here, baby. Right here.|- Move! Move! Move!
{106666}{106772}Things remain tight here.|The Gallop and the Banshees|are playing equally so far.
{106773}{106895}They've been trading basket for|basket,yet the Gallop holding|a slim lead for the moment.
{106897}{106954}It's been that kind of game,|but we should have a wild finish.
{107192}{107225}Juwanna Mann!|Juwanna Mann!
{107226}{107336}With just nine seconds left,|the Banshees are down by one.
{107338}{107424}There's the steal. The ball|is stolen by Juwanna Mann.
{107425}{107469}Look at Juwanna Mann go.
{107470}{107542}Could Juwanna Mann|possibly slam-dunk this ball?
{108016}{108100}Yes! Yes!
{108101}{108170}Whoo-hoo-hoo.|Whoo-hoo.
{108172}{108218}Yes!
{108220}{108253}Yes.
{108416}{108470}I can't believe what I'm seeing here.
{108472}{108512}It's Jamal Jeffries.
{108513}{108605}And that's|your play of the day.
{108773}{108848}It don't make me|no difference.
{108849}{108926}I still love you,|Juwanna Mann.
{108928}{108986}I love you,|Juwanna Mann!
{108988}{109036}Juwanna Mann.
{109069}{109142}I love you,|even though I guess--
{109144}{109221}You're still a man.|I'm-- Does that make me a man?
{109223}{109257}Juwanna!
{109258}{109317}Juwanna.
{109373}{109407}The hell|is happening to me?
{109500}{109599}Hold on, Michelle. I can explain,|all right? Just give me a minute.
{109601}{109646}Michelle.
{109648}{109712}Michelle.
{109764}{109810}Damn.
{110240}{110321}In perhaps the most|bizarre sports story ever...
{110322}{110380}women's pro basketball star,|Juwanna Mann...
{110381}{110488}has turned out to be exactly|what her name implies-- a man.
{110490}{110540}He a sicko.|Straight-up sicko.
{110542}{110604}No comment. Excuse me.|No comment. Excuse me.
{110606}{110688}In my country, penis okay.
{110689}{110746}My mother have penis.
{110748}{110772}The WUBA's Charlotte Banshees have fired|Jamal Jeffiries for posing as a woman.
{110772}{110888}The WUBA's Charlotte Banshees have fired|Jamal Jeffiries for posing as a woman.
{110889}{110965}The odd thing is, Jeffiries is known|for being a big playboy.
{110967}{111044}The team said they became suspicious|when they caught him hitting on himself.
{111045}{111121}In fact--|In fact, he could--
{111406}{111509}Since the opening tip, the Charlotte|Banshees really have been struggling.
{111510}{111566}They have not looked|very smooth offiensively here.
{111568}{111628}Jamal, Jamal, Jamal.
{111715}{111770}I see you|moping around.
{111772}{111832}I see you|down in the dumps.
{111865}{111952}I also see you ain't been|using no plates in this room.
{112221}{112272}You got yourself|quite a mess here.
{112310}{112359}I'll clean it up.
{112361}{112456}I'm not talking about this mess.|I'm talking about that mess.
{112497}{112545}Sit up.
{112546}{112593}Scoot over.
{112747}{112841}It's no sense in crying|over spilt milk
{112843}{112925}Best thing to do is start|looking for a paper towel.
{112964}{113010}You hear me?
{113089}{113135}Huh?
{113296}{113348}- Next.|- Damn.
{113349}{113421}It appears the Banshee fans|are just as disheartened as the players.
{113422}{113493}Well, Chris, I would|absolutely have to agree with you.
{113494}{113592}And unlike the Gallop, this Phoenix Web|team, they have a lot of game.
{113593}{113646}The Banshees need|to turn this around now.
{113648}{113740}Otherwise, they are gonna get blown out|and they will not advance to the finals.
{113741}{113794}Brought my A-game today.
{113868}{113914}Let's pick it up, guys.
{113916}{113992}Can you handle that? Second half.|That's what I wanna see.
{113993}{114082}What's the matter|with you guys? Huh?
{114084}{114198}Coach, face it. We're never gonna get|to the championship without Jamal.
{114200}{114255}That's not true.
{114290}{114370}What you doing here?|This is the ladies' locker room, perv.
{114372}{114432}I just wanna talk|to you guys, all right?
{114433}{114499}- Oh, please.|- You ain't got nothing to say.
{114501}{114554}All right, ladies, hold up.
{114556}{114672}I think we're letting Mr. Jeffiries offi|a little easy by throwing him out.
{114701}{114748}Let's listen|to what he has to say.
{114749}{114812}I think we all|wanna hear this.
{114861}{114926}Guys, look, uh...
{114928}{114988}I messed up, all right?
{115025}{115111}What I did it was--
{115113}{115194}it was wrong,|it was selfish...
{115196}{115255}and I'm--
{115289}{115355}I'm truly sorry.
{115395}{115454}When I first got here,|I got to tell you...
{115456}{115525}I thought women's basketball|was a big joke.
{115568}{115648}Hell, I thought anything that wasn't|about Jamal Jeffiries was a big joke.
{115705}{115754}Turns out|the joke was on me.
{115835}{115937}That's because I thought that the most|important thing about basketball...
{115938}{115985}was being a star.
{116056}{116160}That's until you guys taught me|the only way to truly shine...
{116213}{116278}was to be a part of a team.
{116326}{116373}So if you guys|wanna hate me...
{116374}{116439}and Lord knows|I understand you if you do.
{116482}{116560}But you're gonna have|to hate me after the game...
{116561}{116651}because you guys never|needed me to win this...
{116653}{116722}and you don't need me now.
{116809}{116844}I needed you.
{116931}{117001}So come on. Go win it.
{117256}{117323}And, Latisha.
{117325}{117384}Your game is on.
{117422}{117523}Keep an eye out for Magda.|She's getting open in the post.
{118154}{118213}I don't know what happened|in that locker room at halftime...
{118215}{118281}but the Banshee team is playing|with tremendous emotion.
{118282}{118344}-Somehow they've been rejuvenated.|- Well, Chris,you're right.
{118346}{118438}This is like a completely diffierent|team. What an amazing turnaround.
{118440}{118527}Don't look now, but the Banshees|might actually get to the big show.
{118796}{118842}We're winners!
{119177}{119223}Dear Michelle--
{119274}{119336}Just 'cause it's Wednesday.
{119558}{119640}The fans deserve to have|a true basketball star...
{119641}{119752}and a future role model|finish his career on top.
{119754}{119837}Please believe me when I tell you|that Mr. Jeffiries is a changed man.
{119873}{119954}And I say that,|not only as his agent...
{119989}{120046}but as his friend too.
{120080}{120157}Mr. Jeffiries, after hearing|the very sincere...
{120159}{120228}and impassioned plea|from your representative...
{120229}{120323}I must say that|I am still left rather unimpressed.
{120325}{120388}You have not only disgraced|our men's pro league...
{120389}{120464}but the women's|pro league as well.
{120466}{120513}This is|a closed hearing.
{120514}{120614}With all due respect, sir, and on|behalf of the Charlotte Banshees...
{120616}{120709}we in no way feel that Jamal Jeffries|has disgraced our league.
{120710}{120780}Without a doubt,|he may have disgraced himself...
{120812}{120867}and he is certainly|paying the price for that.
{120869}{120960}- But we forgive him.|- No doubt, no doubt.
{120961}{121023}We feel|that you should too.
{121061}{121132}We want you|to have this, Jamal.
{121457}{121535}I'm convinced. I think|they've made their point.
{121597}{121644}We out of here, y'all.
{122068}{122185}And now, returning|for his second year at starting guard...
{122186}{122257}the only man who has played|in both the men's...
{122259}{122340}and women's professional|basketball leagues...
{122341}{122388}North Carolina's own...
{122389}{122453}Jamal Jeffiries.
{122889}{122942}- Hey, you, you!|- What, man?
{122944}{123019}That's not a keg. You know|how much this stupid thing costs?
{123021}{123087}What does it matter to you?|The bank owns it now anyway.
{123089}{123136}The bank?|The bank owns this?
{123137}{123192}- Yeah.|- Oh, really?
{123193}{123298}The bank's got a dustpan in the kitchen.|Maybe you need to get that too.
{123300}{123416}What's up, baby? Yeah.|You look like an angel in this light.
{123460}{123524}- Give it to me.|- Mark.
{123573}{123664}Yo, man, what's up?|I just saw you on the television, man.
{123665}{123745}That movie was the flyest.|You did like this.
{123746}{123817}You do it like this. Oh, yeah.|You went like this. I was like--
{123881}{123956}- Oh, you don't have to--|- Thank you. Thank you.
{123958}{124035}Okay, Magda.
