00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,332
[Skip To My Lou]

2
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:21,386
Hello, Lady.

3
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,988
Edith? You okay in there?

4
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:26,580
Yes, dear, I'm fine.

5
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:27,926
Do you need anything
from the store?

6
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:28,727
Hurry up, guys.

7
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,957
Clara! You're going
to be late for school!

8
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,464
Orange juice, perhaps.

9
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:34,896
Does Lady need food?

10
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,034
I don't know.

11
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,802
Okay, well,
I'm closing the door now, Edith.

12
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:39,037
It's not safe to leave it open.

13
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,139
'Cause I live in a firetrap.

14
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,840
Come on.

15
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,943
It's not a firetrap.
That's a treasure trove.

16
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:48,246
If stacks of stuff dated from the
'50s count as a treasure trove.

17
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:49,881
They do.

18
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,484
Avery, you're gonna have to
move the car today, remember?

19
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,151
Right.

20
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,786
You sit in it with Lucas
and hold our spot...

21
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,549
-and I'll walk Clara over.
-Right.

22
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:05,662
Okay!

23
00:06:06,764 --> 00:06:09,200
Come on, sweetie.

24
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,304
Careful, guys.

25
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,466
Careful, guys.

26
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:22,141
Didn't I just clean this out
last week?

27
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,418
Hey, check it out.
Look at those books!

28
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,587
Think we can get them
before mom notices?

29
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:29,788
No, Avery, please.

30
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,791
Put your family's best interest first.
Think of the common good.

31
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,626
That's exactly what I'm doing.

32
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:37,652
That's exactly what I'm doing.

33
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,832
Okay, in the car we go.

34
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,163
Can I have some?

35
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:52,936
Bonjour.

36
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:55,540
I wish I was French, too.

37
00:06:56,548 --> 00:06:59,084
It's my birthday tomorrow.
I'm gonna be 6!

38
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,486
And I'm having my party
up there tonight!

39
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:04,222
Really?
In your apartment.

40
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:08,393
For my 6th birthday,
we had a private marionette show.

41
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,729
I'm gonna have 10 friends!

42
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,297
My 7th was at the Swedish Cottage.

43
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:15,166
First, my mom said I could
only have 6 friends

44
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:16,668
because I'm gonna be 6.

45
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:20,705
Then, Serendipity 3
delivered frozen hot chocolate.

46
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,708
But then, my dad talked her
into letting me have 10.

47
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,277
Afterwards, my friends and I
got carriage rides

48
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,279
in Central Park at sunset.

49
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,716
I'm gonna have a triple layer cake,
with purple frosting.

50
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:35,153
And I'm gonna have
really cool goodie bags,

51
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:37,722
right, Mom?

52
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,224
Not the goodie bags again.

53
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,426
Eliza, you are brave.

54
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:43,662
Really? How so?

55
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,363
Just to live as you do, you know?

56
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:49,100
The stairs, the children,
the car, the dog.

57
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,436
It's a bit exhausting, no?

58
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:54,005
Is that your definition of "brave"?

59
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:57,776
Eliza, could you give me a hand
with this buckle?

60
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,011
Mom, you forgot my backpack,

61
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,981
and I definitely need it
before choice time.

62
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,948
Okay.

63
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:05,116
Eliza, are you--?

64
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,949
Are you wearing your nightgown?

65
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,642
Has it really come to this?

66
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,410
That I, Eliza K. Welch,

67
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,846
find myself humiliated
in my nightgown

68
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,981
in front of my neighbor's
townhouse?

69
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:40,118
My husband has run Clara
around the corner to P.S. 3,

70
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,687
and I have exactly
9 minutes to write.

71
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,589
How can a mother
articulate her ideas

72
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,258
with anything approaching
wit or conviction

73
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:50,455
in such ridiculously
tiny wedges of time?

74
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:06,778
It's ZachsMommy again.

75
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:09,147
"Quit complaining, SanctaMommy!

76
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,516
No one has any time.

77
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:15,520
Save your quest for self-expression
until the kids go off to college. "

78
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,958
Must a woman's soul
wither and die

79
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,393
simply because she opted
to become a mother?

80
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:25,330
I want to finish the laundry
and a complex sentence,

81
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,098
to think tantalizingly
deep thoughts

82
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:30,001
and throw a magical birthday party
for my daughter.

83
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:34,632
Is that truly too much to ask?

84
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,086
Tomorrow, Clara turns 6.

85
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,855
She's more than half way
to double digits.

86
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:54,526
She'll be going to college
in 12 years.

87
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:58,496
That used to seem
like a long time.

88
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:02,228
Now I can blink,
and it'd be over.

89
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,349
"Speak your mind and become
our resident Mom-ologist

90
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,218
with your very own column,

91
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,620
worth up to 3,000 dollars a month!

92
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:24,455
Runners-up receive
either 1,000 dollars

93
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:27,592
or an all-expense paid trip
to this year's Mamapalooza,

94
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:30,428
the festival for moms who rock. "

95
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,030
You've gotta be kidding me.

96
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:36,763
"Just send us 500 words telling us
what motherhood means to you. "

97
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,104
My God!

98
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:41,299
It's perfect!

99
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,567
No.

100
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,053
Folks, coming up,

101
00:10:55,054 --> 00:11:00,692
we're going to see the historic former
home of Edna St. Vincent Millay.

102
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,327
But first,
get those cameras ready....

103
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:02,994
Excuse me.

104
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,463
This is a neighborhood, people,
not a theme park.

105
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:06,264
"Get her picture! Get her--!

106
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:09,334
"Here's the corner we all know
and love from Friends."

107
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,502
Though, whenever you see
an inside shot,

108
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:15,073
that was actually filmed
on a soundstage in Los Angeles.

109
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:18,065
Hurry, kids! Hurry! Come on!

110
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,748
Hey! Sheila! Sheila!

111
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,618
Hi! What's shakin', babe?

112
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,519
Do I have
Joan Crawford eyebrows?

113
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,489
I applied pencil like it was
magic marker, and I didn't check.

114
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,024
Tell me the truth.

115
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,159
No, they look good.
They're, 'ya know, zesty.

116
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,928
Zesty?

117
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:39,364
I have to have this in Clara's
classroom by choice time,

118
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,632
or it's sudden death
for Bad Mommy.

119
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,794
-Will you walk with me?
-Sure.

120
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:45,436
Hey, do you want me

121
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:47,138
to pick up Clara
and bring her with us?

122
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,606
'Cause I know Trixie
would love it.

123
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,132
But I thought Joel
had the kids on Fridays.

124
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,608
He's in Santa Fe.

125
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:54,512
Chasing another
new wild potter?

126
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,482
I don't know. Maybe.
Who cares?

127
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,350
I've really gotta go for this, right?

128
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:03,888
I mean, there's something validating
about having a real job, you know?

129
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,156
It's been awhile.

130
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:08,960
Yeah, there's definitely something
validating about having a real job.

131
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,462
I mean, especially one
that actually pays you more

132
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:13,498
than the childcare
required to do it.

133
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,633
And it has been awhile.

134
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:16,834
You sure you're ready to move

135
00:12:16,835 --> 00:12:18,503
beyond entourages
of organic snacks?

136
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,605
Completely!

137
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,674
I mean, it gives me a chance
to explore what it really means

138
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:26,411
to become a mother,
and nobody talks about this stuff.

139
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,413
The sleep deprivation,

140
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:32,951
the funks, the non-stop cleaning,
the death of lust.

141
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:36,454
I can see Lunchbox magazine
flying off the stands.

142
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,589
Here's my first headline:

143
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:42,760
"To thine own self be true:
Don't Breed."

144
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,285
Too late.

145
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:05,009
Hi, Trixie!

146
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,721
Shit!

147
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,957
-What?
-Avery forgot to walk Coupon!

148
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:13,891
Shit is right.

149
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:19,193
You better get home, or you're
gonna find a deposit on your rug.

150
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,208
Avery?

151
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,643
Avery.

152
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:35,246
Avery.

153
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:38,341
This stuff is incredible, really.

154
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,285
Avery, did you forget
something this morning?

155
00:13:41,286 --> 00:13:42,253
What?

156
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,655
I don't know, it was essentially
our firstborn, you know?

157
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:46,457
The one
with the incontinence issues?

158
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,792
Oops, sorry.

159
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,128
Single most abused word
in the English language.

160
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,295
"Oops" or "sorry"?

161
00:13:51,296 --> 00:13:54,198
All right, so I'll stay with Lucas,
and you go get Coupon.

162
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:55,833
No... You can't do that.

163
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,002
I got an editorial meeting at 9:30.

164
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,237
If I don't leave now,
I'm never gonna make it.

165
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,738
No, no, no, no!
You never told me that!

166
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:03,574
Yes, I did. I told you this morning
while you were combing Clara's hair.

167
00:14:03,575 --> 00:14:04,942
Don't worry, I'll be back by 1:00.

168
00:14:04,943 --> 00:14:06,310
No, but 1:00 is too late!

169
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:08,112
I don't think Coupon
can hold it till then,

170
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,514
and he can't walk himself

171
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,215
because he can't make it
down the stairs anymore.

172
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:11,816
Holy Moly!

173
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,351
Did you go to the
cash machine at least?

174
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,988
Eliza, I wish you would stop
talking to me like I'm impaired.

175
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,856
Yes, I did.

176
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,425
I.... No-- I'm sorry, okay?

177
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,794
There's just something I want
to do today. It's incredible.

178
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,930
It's this writing thing, which
could be just perfect for me and--

179
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:31,502
I guess I'll just figure out
how to get it all done by myself.

180
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,403
-Bye!
-Bye!

181
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,330
Come on.

182
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,093
I got ya!

183
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:04,969
Orange juice.

184
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,738
Edith?
I forgot your orange juice.

185
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:10,174
I'm sorry,
I'll bring you some more later?

186
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:15,780
Orange juice?
I don't need any orange juice, dear.

187
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:19,648
I'm closing the door now, Edith.
It's not safe to leave it open.

188
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,720
Okay.

189
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,835
Hurry up, Coupon, let's go.

190
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:41,601
Street sweeper!

191
00:15:42,606 --> 00:15:45,009
God. Coupon! Get busy.

192
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:45,843
Get busy.

193
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,079
Get a Prius, New Jersey!

194
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,571
Go home, scumbag!

195
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:56,113
Good job, Coupon!
Good boy!

196
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,660
So, you just gonna leave it there?

197
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:05,630
No, I just, I gotta get my kid
in the car,

198
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,623
so I can move the car, so the street
sweeper can clean the street.

199
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,670
I'll pick it up later.

200
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:15,106
What if someone
steps in it before then?

201
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,608
I'll call 311 and make a complaint.

202
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:21,179
Well, I haven't found that
very effective, but be my guest.

203
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,977
Here, honey.

204
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,554
And you're not even
going to strap him in?

205
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:30,855
Give me a break.

206
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,347
Okay....

207
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:37,857
No!

208
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,935
Come on, lady, move it!

209
00:16:55,113 --> 00:16:57,706
Now where the hell is this guy?

210
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,717
What's going on?

211
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,453
Every Tuesday and Friday
you gotta move your car

212
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,088
so they can clean the street.

213
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:07,558
Except this one here.
They're from Jersey.

214
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,393
They leave it,
and then pay the ticket.

215
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:11,028
It's cheaper than a garage.

216
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:14,123
And then the street sweeper
can't get around!

217
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:16,133
Hey, move it, Volvo lady!

218
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:17,568
Move that freakin' car!

219
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,571
I can't, I'll lose my spot!

220
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,640
Why doesn't everybody just back up?

221
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,508
Come on! Move your car!

222
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:25,943
Come around!

223
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,571
We can't move, 'ya cunt!

224
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,351
Motherfucker!

225
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,552
What is that woman doing?

226
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,020
She's nuts.

227
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:38,819
Look, that's her dog shit.
She just left it there.

228
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:39,857
Give him hell!

229
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,492
Did you just say
what I think you said?

230
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:42,526
Yeah, that's right, you heard me.

231
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:45,896
You just used the C-word in front
of a child, in front of a school!

232
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:47,798
Your mother must be
very proud of you.

233
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:48,599
Hey, you leave my mother
out of this!

234
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,267
No, no, no.

235
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,936
She must be very, very proud
that her son grew up to be....

236
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,404
What do you do? Roofing!

237
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,139
That her son's a roofer.

238
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,274
-Shut up, lady.
-Impressive.

239
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,643
Do they give you a degree in that?
Advanced shingling?

240
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,212
Hey, I said, shut up!

241
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:07,818
All right, I'm sorry
that I insulted your profession.

242
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:09,687
Well, somebody's gotta fix roofs.

243
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:11,856
Right. Agreed.

244
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,557
I mean, I'm one to talk.

245
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:16,861
I'm just trying to raise 2 kids
in this godforsaken city

246
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,863
that's a shadow of its former self.

247
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,065
Do you ever think about maybe
moving out to the suburbs?

248
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,200
Like we could afford the taxes!

249
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:25,369
Yeah, I hear you on that.
I hear you on that.

250
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,372
He's escaping!
Somebody call the police!

251
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,067
Hey, you better get up there!

252
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,533
No!

253
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,845
Move the car!
This isn't a parking lot!

254
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:35,980
What are you doing?

255
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:40,484
Sweetie! Sweetie! No, no, no!
I'm so sorry. Back you go.

256
00:18:40,485 --> 00:18:41,852
Report her to social services!

257
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:43,721
Hey, cut the lady some slack.

258
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,290
Can't you see
she's having a hard day?

259
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,382
Thank you.

260
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,168
Watch out!

261
00:19:00,505 --> 00:19:01,630
Look.

262
00:19:06,978 --> 00:19:11,148
Lucas, sweetie, I am so sorry
I left you all alone like that.

263
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:13,718
And mommy's sorry
she was smoking, too.

264
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,820
And yelling.

265
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,756
Smoking and yelling are 2 things
that Lunchbox Magazine

266
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,349
would tell you to avoid.

267
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,796
I'm sorry.

268
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:30,201
Mommy's just gonna, just race
around the block as fast as she can.

269
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,635
As quick as a wink!

270
00:19:31,636 --> 00:19:32,864
A wink!

271
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,268
I'm gonna lose my spot!

272
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:38,307
No.

273
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,133
Don't!

274
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:45,649
No...!
Hey! No, no, no!

275
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,559
All right, one sec.

276
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,550
Don't, don't, don't.

277
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,702
Excuse me!

278
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,706
Look, I'm sorry to bother you!

279
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:13,544
I know you're not napping because
I saw you just pull into my spot.

280
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,279
It's not your spot.

281
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,347
But I live here.

282
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,582
You live in the West Village, so you
can afford to park someplace else.

283
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,018
No, you can say that,
but you'd be wrong, okay?

284
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:24,655
My apartment is right there,
rather I should say, our apartments.

285
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,924
You've got more
than one apartment?

286
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,527
They're rent stabilized,
and one is a studio.

287
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,263
Look, I'm throwing a birthday party
for my daughter tonight,

288
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:35,299
and I need to park here
so I can stash stuff in the car.

289
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,168
That is, if I can fit anything,

290
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:40,671
considering my husband has filled
the back of the car with old books.

291
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,306
You see, he has this fantasy

292
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:46,177
of starting an online rare book
business to enrich our lifestyle.

293
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,778
How about that?

294
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:51,009
Anyway, we live in a walk-up.

295
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,189
Come on!

296
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,413
"My, what a wonderful house
this would be.

297
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:26,817
I will live in it until the people
who own it come for it.

298
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:29,086
And then, the little old man--"

299
00:21:29,587 --> 00:21:32,389
That's us. Okay.
Come on, sweetie.

300
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,555
Okay, here we go.

301
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:43,261
Come, sweetie, here we go.

302
00:21:45,136 --> 00:21:48,230
Yeah....

303
00:22:17,068 --> 00:22:19,203
Good sharing, Courtney!

304
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:23,868
I am very proud of you
for your excellent sharing.

305
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:26,944
No, no, drop it.

306
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,810
That's made in China.

307
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,016
Hey! Watch it.

308
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,051
He's a whole lot smaller than you.

309
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:36,086
Excuse me,
did you just say something?

310
00:22:36,087 --> 00:22:37,421
Did she say something to you, Jordan?

311
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:41,125
Look, I'm sorry, but your son
nearly crushed my kid.

312
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,560
He's a whole lot bigger.

313
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,061
Are you saying my son's overweight?

314
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:47,464
I said big. Actually,
what I said was "bigger."

315
00:22:47,465 --> 00:22:50,067
Don't you dare
ever speak to him again.

316
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,899
It's glandular!

317
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:58,943
No, Trish.
Trish, you cook pot roast at 375.

318
00:22:58,944 --> 00:22:59,944
Yeah.

319
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:05,115
And don't forget to mail
the Con-Ed bill, please.

320
00:23:05,116 --> 00:23:07,985
My wife.

321
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:11,956
Yeah, okay, bye.

322
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,657
Jodie Foster alert.

323
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:14,792
Excuse me?

324
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:18,529
I swear to God, it's Jodie!
She's coming in right now.

325
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:22,099
Jodie, Jodie! Over here, Jodie!
Who's the father?

326
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,835
Last week, I had
a Sarah Jessica Parker sighting.

327
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:29,173
I've seen Julianne Moore,
Kate Winslet, and James Gandolfini.

328
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,308
I swear, it's like a movie star
playground.

329
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:34,178
I come in all the way from Scarsdale
because, you know, you never know,

330
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:37,881
I could sell it to Us, right?

331
00:23:37,882 --> 00:23:39,416
Who's your baby-daddy, Jodie?

332
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:42,953
You should work in a soup kitchen,
you fucking parasites.

333
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:45,856
Here you go, honey.
Got your jacket?

334
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,858
Should a mother really
have to choose

335
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:50,561
between simply getting
her kid some fresh air

336
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,121
and being stalked
by the mamarazzi?

337
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,367
Hey, Eliza.

338
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,669
Hey, Lily! Hey, Bodhi!

339
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,703
-Say hi.
-Hi.

340
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,671
What's with the HAZMAT suit?

341
00:24:01,772 --> 00:24:04,074
This? It's a UV-protection robe.

342
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:07,411
I got it for Bodhi off this website.
They make them in Australia.

343
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:08,912
Because of the warming.

344
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:14,752
I hate to say this, but he kinda
looks like a little baby Klansman.

345
00:24:16,153 --> 00:24:19,590
Well, it cuts out 99% of harmful rays.

346
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:22,726
I can send you the link if you want.
I got Indy a poncho off it.

347
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:25,062
Maybe Clara would want one.

348
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:26,897
It's okay.

349
00:24:27,498 --> 00:24:30,100
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

350
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:34,171
No, no, no. I'm just...
entering this contest.

351
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:37,908
Really? What's the contest?

352
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:41,845
Just write 500 words about
what motherhood means to me.

353
00:24:41,846 --> 00:24:43,047
What are you gonna say?

354
00:24:46,548 --> 00:24:49,553
Stuff, I guess. I don't know.

355
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:52,322
How motherhood is all about
rainbows and unicorns

356
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:55,526
and sunny days and....

357
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,194
I've got something up my sleeve.

358
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:58,662
Okay.

359
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,130
Hey, do you want to borrow some?

360
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,599
It's cruelty and chemical free.
They make it in Oregon.

361
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,068
No, thanks.

362
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:41,271
Lily? Lily, what are you doing?

363
00:25:41,772 --> 00:25:44,206
Haven't you read
The Crying and the Raging?

364
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,846
It's the most amazing book.

365
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:51,815
This pediatrician in Norway
came up with the theory

366
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:55,052
that if you really connect
with your child in his moment of pain,

367
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,154
it calms them down.

368
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,289
It's really made a difference
for me and Bodhi.

369
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,125
Lily, will you excuse me
for a second?

370
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,527
Sure.

371
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,763
Are you feeling better?

372
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:09,133
Do you have the hiccups?

373
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:12,035
Let's look around
and see what we see.

374
00:26:12,036 --> 00:26:18,065
I think I see a little chipmunk.
That's not a chipmunk.

375
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,645
I don't have the faintest notion

376
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,447
what motherhood means to me,
you know what I mean?

377
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:26,650
Since when does a stroller
have to cost as much as a car?

378
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,819
Okay, a used car.

379
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,854
Since the world has started
breeding more.

380
00:26:31,755 --> 00:26:32,923
What?

381
00:26:33,524 --> 00:26:35,292
-I can't believe....
-What?

382
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:37,427
They towed my goddamn car!

383
00:26:37,428 --> 00:26:38,862
Shit.

384
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:40,664
<i>Please leave your message at the beep.</i>

385
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:42,757
Avery, where are you?

386
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:46,837
I'm freaking out, okay?
They're shooting on our block again.

387
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:49,840
They moved the cars.
Call me as soon as you get this.

388
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:50,674
I gotta go. Bye.

389
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:52,676
Where is my car?

390
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:53,911
We have a resident here.

391
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:54,778
<i>She can pick up her car anytime.</i>

392
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,479
Copy that.

393
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,680
Who moved it?

394
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:59,917
Well, there's signs on all the posts.
Check them. No parking today.

395
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:03,086
There were no signs
when I left it here an hour ago.

396
00:27:03,087 --> 00:27:04,755
-Right there!
-Ma'am, look--

397
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:05,722
Don't "ma'am" me!

398
00:27:05,723 --> 00:27:07,791
I may technically be old enough
to be your mother,

399
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:08,992
but I am not a "ma'am."

400
00:27:08,993 --> 00:27:10,093
The car's been moved

401
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:11,562
to a secure location
on Barrow Street,

402
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:13,297
all the way west.

403
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,400
Film crews are supposed
to give 24-hour notice.

404
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,001
I can give you the number
to the mayor's office

405
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:19,870
if you'd like to call
and file a complaint.

406
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,305
Very helpful. Great.

407
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:25,642
You're telling me that you towed
my car, and I have to bite it, right?

408
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,544
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you
to cross the street.

409
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:28,879
We're setting up here.

410
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,614
Hester, can you believe this?

411
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:33,717
I'm gonna piss in a pot
and dump it on 'em later.

412
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:35,652
Out the window, splat.

413
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,984
Right on!

414
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:44,090
Danny, go to 2.

415
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:48,465
Why is it that once you pass
35 and have a kid in tow,

416
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:51,268
you automatically
become a "ma'am"?

417
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:55,339
"Ma'am" means support hose,
a girdle, a bad perm.

418
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,408
I'll wear hot pants and platforms
when I'm on a walker

419
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:04,040
if only to avoid
being called "ma'am. "

420
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,496
Avery, Avery, Avery!
Answer your phone for once, Avery!

421
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:21,031
<i>You've reached Avery.
Please leave your message--</i>

422
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:34,811
I used to be fluid, I used to be,
I don't know, graceful.

423
00:28:34,812 --> 00:28:38,782
Now my words come out,
and they just sound like bad ad copy.

424
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:42,586
Well, maybe your brain's
worn out from over-sharing.

425
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:46,189
Sheila, just blog-slam me
when I'm down!

426
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,594
Avery lost his cell phone,
by the way,

427
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,296
the ultimate passive-aggressive act.

428
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,932
Avery would lose his scrotum
if it wasn't attached.

429
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,900
Well, it's either that,
or he silenced it,

430
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,637
which is the most effective way
of silencing me.

431
00:29:01,538 --> 00:29:06,276
No longer my problem,
being silenced.

432
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:08,378
I mean,
God forbid I ever raised a topic

433
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:12,449
from Joel's top 10 list
of "musts to avoid."

434
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,218
Like, why you can't balance
his checkbook.

435
00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:18,922
Or vacuum. Or remember
the substitute teacher's name.

436
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,758
Or tolerate a single comment
about September 11

437
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:23,260
at the dinner table.

438
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,829
God, maybe that's gonna show up
in the divorce papers.

439
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,498
"Refused to stop referencing
traumatic event

440
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:30,600
more than 6 years
after the fact."

441
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:35,572
"By the way,
'Why can't you just get over it?"'

442
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:37,474
I'll tell you why.

443
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:41,945
'Cause you're always thinking,
you're always wondering, "What if?"

444
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,748
I mean, have I done everything
I could possibly do

445
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:48,151
to stave off disaster?

446
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:51,388
Did I tell Clara how much I loved her
this morning before school,

447
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,023
just in case
she never makes it home again.

448
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:55,392
Liz, you gotta stop.

449
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:58,362
I can't stop.

450
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,931
Well, as a fearless leader
once said,

451
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:05,869
"When you can't stop,
you must shop."

452
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,685
You know, the grand irony
of the whole thing

453
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:26,490
is that the first time around,
all I wanted...

454
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,891
Thank you.

455
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:31,061
Was for Joel to leave me alone
and not touch me.

456
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:32,562
Well, that was because
your joints ached.

457
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:34,598
And I had to pee every 5 seconds.

458
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,900
Which is better than peeing
all over yourself,

459
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:39,603
which is what you do
after you give birth.

460
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,972
Yeah, the cruel twist of fate
is that at this time,

461
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:44,141
all the women do is shag.

462
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,143
And there is nobody to shag me.

463
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:48,412
She got pregnant
through sympathy sex.

464
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,747
Her husband felt guilty
after he ran off,

465
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:53,316
so he sent the kids out with a sitter,
got a bottle of wine,

466
00:30:53,317 --> 00:30:54,751
and jumped on her.

467
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,119
Shagged me madly.

468
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,587
Got her pregnant--

469
00:30:57,588 --> 00:30:58,722
And then he left her.

470
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,090
Pig!

471
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,752
Yeah.

472
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:05,328
Hey, you guys....

473
00:31:05,329 --> 00:31:07,697
-That's nice.
-It's pretty, yeah.

474
00:31:07,698 --> 00:31:09,533
For a 6-year-old.

475
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,101
I gotta tell you something.

476
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,437
It does not leave this room.

477
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:17,707
Okay, so last night,
I got the kids to bed about 9:00,

478
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:18,909
and I ran a bath,

479
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,143
which would have been
really lovely

480
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,512
except I only had that
Strawberry Shortcake bubble bath.

481
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:27,551
-So I'm lying there, in the bath--
-Yeah....

482
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,386
naked--

483
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,887
What? What?

484
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:31,822
Good!

485
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:37,027
You know the little,
motorized submarine bath toys....

486
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,529
-The little, "Chiggachiggachigga...."
-Yeah.

487
00:31:41,732 --> 00:31:43,300
What?

488
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,598
You know, they look
a bit like dildos.

489
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,005
You're dirty!

490
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:53,143
It was lovely.
And it was amazing.

491
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:57,347
It was lovely and amazing.
I got very lucky with the submarine.

492
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:02,018
Okay, all right, look,
the moment of reckoning.

493
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:05,856
Lay it on me.
Where would I wear this?

494
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,517
Parent-teacher conference.

495
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,760
Okay.

496
00:32:10,761 --> 00:32:11,955
What about...

497
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:14,698
this one?

498
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:18,034
Well, that's for the date that's
never gonna happen, isn't it?

499
00:32:18,035 --> 00:32:23,404
Or in case you ever feel like enticing
the spousal unit to do 'ya.

500
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,475
Hey, how about this one?

501
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:28,945
Well, that's nice.
That's for keeping cozy at your desk.

502
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:31,381
Cozy at my desk doing what?

503
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,049
I don't know. I'm just here
for the fashion advice.

504
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:36,720
I can't solve your life crisis.

505
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:41,282
I'm gonna go check out the size 29.

506
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:43,793
What does it say about the world

507
00:32:43,794 --> 00:32:46,897
when a perfectly attractive woman
like my best friend Sheila

508
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:52,636
has to resort to wanking off
with her son's bath toy?

509
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:57,307
Even if she is seriously pregnant
at this point,

510
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:01,710
it somehow seems unjust.

511
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:13,390
Motherhood is not knowing
what's going to hit you next.

512
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:18,419
Motherhood is a day in May,
a hot air balloon...

513
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:27,729
God's gift to womankind.

514
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:01,071
What about when
your child's hand is still so small

515
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:05,475
that he or she puts that hand
in yours with absolute trust?

516
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:08,278
Their incredibly soft cheeks
when you kiss them.

517
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:10,614
The way their foreheads sweat
when they're sleeping,

518
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,148
and the hair sticks to it.

519
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:16,886
The hilariously weird things they
say when they're learning to talk.

520
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:19,756
The way you save their lost teeth
after they fall out,

521
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,858
and you've done
your tooth fairy routine,

522
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,760
like some demented Nazi,

523
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:27,063
because you can't stand
to give up any part of them,

524
00:34:27,064 --> 00:34:29,766
no matter how tiny.

525
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:32,302
Sorry I'm late.

526
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:36,473
Morris needed the final edit
on the Albanian manuscript.

527
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:39,376
Jesus, you know, I had to pile
through a bunch of extras

528
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:43,013
with really bad moustaches
just to get to the front door.

529
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,881
Did you notice
that our car got towed?

530
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:47,183
Yes, I did.
I've been trying to call you.

531
00:34:47,184 --> 00:34:48,918
-Hi!
-Hi.

532
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:50,288
Really?

533
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,523
Yeah. Look at that.
8 missed calls.

534
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:54,956
Ringer must have been off.

535
00:34:55,192 --> 00:34:58,028
So, did you have something
you needed to tell me?

536
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,963
Nothing that I couldn't
figure out on my own.

537
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:01,364
You have no idea
how lucky you are

538
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,500
to be married
to a consummate multitasker.

539
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,434
But I do know.

540
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,275
Hey, can you please
take him across the hall?

541
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,544
I need to put in
another half an hour. I just--

542
00:35:14,845 --> 00:35:16,179
I'm just beginning
to get somewhere.

543
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:16,880
-Really?
-Yep.

544
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,279
Good.

545
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:36,299
Is that Paul?
I think that's Paul.

546
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,462
Do you see him?

547
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:41,705
-Did I miss her?
-No, no.

548
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:45,733
Hi, sweetie! Hi!

549
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,611
See your sister, yeah?

550
00:35:48,612 --> 00:35:50,010
Where is she?

551
00:35:51,748 --> 00:35:53,483
-There she is.
-Hi!

552
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,919
Hi, Mom! Hi!

553
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,288
Hi, Clara!

554
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:00,490
God!

555
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,991
Clara!

556
00:36:01,992 --> 00:36:03,860
Line up, please!

557
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,729
Clara?

558
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,464
Clara?

559
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:19,331
It's her last day of being 5.

560
00:36:24,647 --> 00:36:26,149
Avery, Avery, Avery,
Lucas is here.

561
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,283
Didn't you notice?

562
00:36:27,284 --> 00:36:30,387
I put him in front of the Teletubbies.
He'll be paralyzed for an hour.

563
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,756
No, no, no....
I'd love to, but I can't. No!

564
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:35,024
I have a deadline
and a party to throw, remember?

565
00:36:35,025 --> 00:36:36,626
Yeah.

566
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:44,234
Av? Can I borrow your bike?

567
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:45,001
Sure.

568
00:36:45,602 --> 00:36:48,405
Can you read my draft?

569
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:49,939
Can you explain to me
what it is again?

570
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,608
Yes.

571
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:54,511
I'm submitting a piece
to a parenting magazine.

572
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:57,280
It's a contest.
I mean, it's kind of a real gig.

573
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:58,915
But I can't get into that right now.

574
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:01,985
It's only 500 words.
It's a first draft.

575
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:04,854
But, no, I feel like it's solid,
you know?

576
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:07,891
Something I could put my name to
and feel good about it.

577
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,392
I left a copy on my desk.

578
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,693
Sure.

579
00:37:10,694 --> 00:37:11,761
And, Avery?

580
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,299
Nothing. It's just--

581
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,201
Be honest.

582
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:20,033
Bye.

583
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:23,873
Bye!

584
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:27,366
-Bye.
-Bye.

585
00:37:48,732 --> 00:37:50,995
[The Go-Between's
Streets of Your Town]

586
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,095
Shit!

587
00:38:54,164 --> 00:38:56,933
Mama, I want the big Spider-Man,

588
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:59,402
not the little Spider-Man.

589
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:02,105
No, I told you....
It's 39 dollars.

590
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,474
I want the big one!

591
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:07,773
It's too much money, now, come on!

592
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:11,147
I told you,
you can't have this, Jorge!

593
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,549
Stop it, that's enough.

594
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,150
Come on. Laura?

595
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:16,380
Laura, get back over here!

596
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,579
Jorge, come on.

597
00:39:24,828 --> 00:39:29,162
Laura? Laura,
get back over here.

598
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,142
Yeah, Sheila, got the backpack.

599
00:40:13,143 --> 00:40:15,044
I'm doing my Sherpa routine.

600
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:16,679
Do you think our children
have any idea

601
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,714
how we suffer on their behalf?

602
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:18,781
Absolutely not.

603
00:40:18,782 --> 00:40:20,383
Hey, you can't cut the line.

604
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:21,217
Wait your turn!

605
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:22,251
Look, I gotta get out of here.

606
00:40:22,252 --> 00:40:24,887
I just waited 20 minutes
for some moron to blow up balloons.

607
00:40:24,888 --> 00:40:26,189
Well, you can't cut the line.

608
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,992
I've gotta go pick up my twins
from preschool in 10 minutes.

609
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:31,594
They fine you if you're late.

610
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,362
What the hell is going on?

611
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:35,031
Crazy, crazy,
now showing everywhere.

612
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:36,265
Hang on,
I'm just going to get my tea.

613
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:39,669
Hi, yes.
This is Allison Hopper.

614
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,538
Sorry, I'm just gonna be
a weensy bit late

615
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:45,608
picking up Sky and Banjo
this afternoon.

616
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,210
Sorry about that.

617
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:53,082
So, Sheila, I'm feeling, why do I
even care if I win this contest?

618
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:56,252
I mean, I'm addressing such
a narrow sector of the population.

619
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:57,620
Move up, the line moved.

620
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,722
Not as narrow as the one
you're addressing there.

621
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:00,890
Where are you?

622
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,492
Getting goody bag stuff.

623
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,794
So much for sticking
to your principles.

624
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,820
"So much for sticking
to your principles."

625
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:12,368
Some freakazoid is bothering me.

626
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:14,837
"Freakazoid!"

627
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:16,409
What the hell is your problem?

628
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,807
What the hell is your problem?

629
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,977
Sheila, I'm gonna call you back, okay?

630
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,445
No, no, no!

631
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:26,683
Listen, I wasn't speaking very loudly
in the first place, okay?

632
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:28,217
I believe in cell phone etiquette.

633
00:41:28,218 --> 00:41:31,187
You introduced your conversation
into my personal space,

634
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:33,990
thus violating any commonly held
definition of "etiquette."

635

Move it! Move up!

637

Did you know that 90%
of cell phone users

638
00:41:38,962 --> 00:41:39,896
believe they're courteous

639
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,731
while 85% of those same users

640
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:44,167
complain about being annoyed
by others' conversations?

641
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,669
Now, those numbers
really don't add up, do they?

642
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,404
Why don't we have
this conversation in 20 years,

643
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:50,506
when you've learned a thing or 2
about the real world?

644
00:41:50,807 --> 00:41:51,574
You mean when I'm old?

Even you, my friend,

You know what?

00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:03,553
You urban moms are like
a case study in liberal hypocrisy.

648
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:06,255
You think the rules apply
to other people, but never to you.

You blab your precious banalities
into cell phones,

yet have no comprehension
of your carbon footprint!

I'd like to shove my carbon footprint
right up your ass.

Come on, you're up, you're up!

Can you believe this dickhead?

655
00:42:23,006 --> 00:42:23,906
I'm sorry.

But that's not her name.

659
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:20,797
Yes, it is.

660
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:23,166
Says it right here on the order form:
"Clarra."

661
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:25,701
Her name is "Clara."

662
00:43:25,702 --> 00:43:26,903
Look, see?

663
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:30,006
"Clara."
Not, "Clar-ra."

664
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:33,142
Well, our froster
is on a cigarette break, so--

665
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:35,011
Well, can't someone else fix it?

666
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:38,014
All you have to do is just
scrape off the "ra", right?

667
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,683
And rewrite it in matching icing
so it doesn't look like an accident.

668
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:42,385
Only the froster can do that.

Look, I have to go home.
I mean, I have to set up.

We're open till midnight.

I can't come back.
The party is at 5:00.

You have to admit
it's your own fault.

673
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,765
If you had named her
"Sophie" or "Ella,"

674
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:59,168
you wouldn't be having this problem,
but you gave her an "Edna" name.

675
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:01,637
-A what?
-You know, an "Edna" name?

676
00:44:01,638 --> 00:44:04,473
Like "Mabel" or "Agnes" or "Velma."

677
00:44:04,474 --> 00:44:06,475
Yeah, like lesbian librarian names.

Don't you read the
"Crankypants Post"?

679
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:11,747
She did a whole thing last week
about names, it was genius.

Well, yes, I mean I do read her,

What about "The Bjorn Identity"?

That woman is so-- I don't know.

684
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:24,327
I think she's a feminist.

685
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,028
Well, what could be worse than that?

686
00:44:26,529 --> 00:44:30,366
Anyway, "Clara" is not an
"Edna" name, right?

687
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:33,703
Let me guess, you named her after
your favorite grandmother?

-Plays. Well, sort of.

Yeah, I tried to find a job

that would occupy
the least amount of mental space

720
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:06,789
and be so opposite
my true aesthetic intentions

721
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,991
that it wouldn't get in the way,
you know?

722
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,426
Does that work for you?

This was really nice of you.

Do you....?

756
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:05,040
Well, you must be thirsty.

757
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:07,031
Do you want a glass of water?

758
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:08,844
Yeah.

759
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:10,246
Okay.

No. I was--

765
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,061
The view across your rooftop
is so poetical.

766
00:49:26,062 --> 00:49:27,730
You should see where I live.

767
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:30,833
Bushwick, man.
It's a little grim.

768
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:33,437
Well, you're, you're, what, you're...

771
00:49:37,773 --> 00:49:40,543
You can deal with Bushwick, then.

772
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:43,842
When you get to be my age....

773

774
00:49:46,382 --> 00:49:47,913
Well, you look fantastic.

775
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:52,021
Actually, I'm not quite 44.
I'm....

776
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:53,122
I just lied.

777
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:56,251
I think I was hoping
that you just might say that.

778
00:49:57,894 --> 00:50:00,262
The point is,
when you get to be my age,

779
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:02,164
the view becomes less poetical

780
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:07,236
in relationship to other aspects
of living here.

781

kind of artistic statement?

This is one of Avery's
renovation projects.

784

Look closely, and you'll find
similar statements elsewhere.

785
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:22,151
Like his perennially disorganized
personal library.

He seems interesting,
your husband.

00:50:25,507 --> 00:50:26,716
He is.

788
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:28,757
He's....

789
00:50:28,758 --> 00:50:31,761
He's eccentric, and I....

790
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:37,058
I fell in love with those
eccentricities, you know?

791
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:39,835
But then you have kids

792
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:43,105
and try to lead
what's called a grown-up life,

793
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:47,576
and those sort of things become
obstacles to a sane existence.

794
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,840
So you used to be a writer, too?

795
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:54,176
Well, this is you, no?

796
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:57,224
Yes....

797
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:01,190
Or a version of me.
I'd really appreciate it if you--

taste of blood in her mouth.

-Please stop.

Yeah, that was my thing.
That kind of fiercely lyrical fiction.

805
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:23,646
I got scholarships for it.

806
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:27,283
I was considered to be
kind of an up-and-comer.

807
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:29,618
I loved writing.

808
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:31,387
I still do.

809
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:39,595
It's just, you know,

810
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,865
I still write. Sort of.

811
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:46,335
On more, everyday topics.

812
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:48,827
It's just--

813
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:54,977
How come you're being
so nice to me?

814
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:57,379
I saw you go
to that woman next door.

815
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,815
I saw you give her that juice,
very easily.

816
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:01,917
Very selflessly.

817
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:04,586
Why can't I be nice, too?

818
00:52:04,587 --> 00:52:07,356
Besides, you're very pretty.

819

-Tell me something else.
-About what?

820
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:14,263
About being a writer.

821
00:52:14,964 --> 00:52:16,231
Well....

822
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:21,270
I used to write record reviews
when I was first in college

823
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:26,375
and after I graduated, for these
little downtown newspapers,

00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:31,747
none of which really exist anymore,
to get free albums.

Yeah.

Now I'm really dating myself.

828
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,861
I mean, Avie was really into music.

829
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:47,229
He turned me on to lots of bands.

830
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:51,100
I mean, some you've heard of
and probably some you never have.

831
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:51,867

832
00:52:53,268 --> 00:52:54,470
I don't know.

835
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,511
Yeah.

836
00:53:04,312 --> 00:53:05,512
Okay.

837
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:19,026
-You wanna hear something great?
-Yeah.

No, no, no.

842
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:52,161
My downstairs neighbors
have this hideous tool,

843
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:53,762
and they'll just start
banging on the pipes.

844

Who cares?

845
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:26,855
Fantastic!

846
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:29,124
Yeah.

847
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,525
It's great.

848
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:36,595
Well....

849
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,737
Look, I gotta get things
finished up around here

850

851

Absolutely.

854

Well, I'd love to read

Do you have anything more recent?

00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:02,724
No, not at the present moment.

857
00:56:02,725 --> 00:56:10,597
No, at the present moment,
my life is... extremely reality-based.

858
00:56:11,734 --> 00:56:15,637
But I do plan to get back to it
at some point.

859
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:17,773
No, I mean, I will.

860
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:21,476
As my favorite grad school
professor used to say,

861
00:56:21,477 --> 00:56:30,612
"There is no 'try,'
there is only 'do' and 'do not."'

862
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:43,127
Well, Mikesh, it's been

Hold on, I'm coming down!

875
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:01,410
No, don't come down!
Don't fucking bother!

876
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:03,779

just to make yourself
seem more clever and insightful?

881
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:14,356
Christ!
Sheila, I didn't mean to!

882
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:16,992
Yeah, but you did!
It doesn't matter, Eliza!

883
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:19,561
God, I thought
other single moms would relate!

884
00:58:20,262 --> 00:58:23,131
So wait....
Now I'm your token single mom?

885
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:25,367
No, no, no.
Other moms, too, okay?

886
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:27,669
Married moms.
I mean, they can be sympathetic!

887
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:29,838
They can feel sorry for me, too.
Well, that's great.

888
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,707
So everybody
can feel sorry for me!

889
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,475
I don't want anyone
to feel sorry for me!

890
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:34,342
I'm a grown-up!

891
00:58:34,343 --> 00:58:36,078
I made a grown-up choice!

892
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,481
And by the way, married women don't
have a whole lot of sex either...

gotta arrange with Avery and--

899
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:59,701
Of course I'm still bringing Clara.
What do you think?

00:59:00,302 --> 00:59:01,436
God.

You think I'm gonna punish a child

just don't judge me, okay?

01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:07,575
<i>That's why, Avery!</i>

956
01:04:07,576 --> 01:04:10,045
Maybe I should just give it all up
and wear mom jeans.

957
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:12,013
What the hell are mom jeans?

958
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:14,778
It's not like you'd notice, anyway.

959
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:17,485
You wanna know
one of the few benefits of 9/11?

960
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:19,754
Excellent cell phone reception
in the tunnels.

961
01:04:19,755 --> 01:04:21,289
<i>Okay, Eliza?</i>

962
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,725
Just stop, okay?
And listen to me.

963
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:25,026
This isn't funny, really.

964
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:28,630
What is Clara gonna say when
she gets home and you're not there?

965
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:29,731
<i>What does she care?</i>

966
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:32,367
She's got her goody bags
full of plastic crap

967
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:34,269
I bought against my better judgment.

968
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:36,237
<i>She's got her cake
with the misspelled name...</i>

969
01:04:36,238 --> 01:04:38,073
which I corrected myself.

970
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:41,242
She's got her purple cups
and plastic forks.

971
01:04:41,243 --> 01:04:42,877
What does she need me for?

972
01:04:42,878 --> 01:04:44,279
Are you serious?

973
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:48,049
I'm not only serious, I'm in Jersey.

974
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,250
You're in wh--?

975
01:04:49,251 --> 01:04:51,219
Hold on, wait.

976
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:52,120
What?

977
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:53,488
-My God!
-What?

978
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:55,256
I think he swallowed something.

979
01:04:55,257 --> 01:04:56,424
-Hey, hey!
-Swallowed what?

980
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:58,660
Avery! Avery, what did he swallow?

981
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:00,061
I think he's choking!

982
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,463
Avery, don't push your finger
in his throat!

983
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:03,098
You can stick it down further!

984
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:04,566
Yeah, right! Well, what do I do?

985
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,768
Yeah, well, we took that class
together, don't you remember?

986
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:08,536
No, no, I don't remember.
What do I--?

987
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:11,072
You have to stay calm.
Avery, please, please, just--

988
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:12,373
<i>Put him over your knee.</i>

989
01:05:12,374 --> 01:05:13,741
I can't get him out of the stroller.

990
01:05:13,742 --> 01:05:16,077
Put him over your knee and
hit him 3 times on his back!

991
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:17,412
What do I do now?
I got him on my knee.

992
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:20,615
Hit him firmly on the back
3 times!

993
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:21,282
Okay, hold on.

994
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:23,918
God! Come on!
Just spit it out, all right?

995
01:05:23,919 --> 01:05:25,253
Avery! I can't hear you!

996
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:27,822
Come on! Come on, Lucas!
Spit it out, spit it out!

997
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:28,957
<i>Avery?
What are you doing?</i>

998
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:30,725
Avery?

999
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:34,127
Shit! Shit...!

1000
01:05:37,966 --> 01:05:39,934
Lucas! Lucas, I'm coming!

1001
01:05:40,235 --> 01:05:43,138
My God! Lucas!
My God!

1002
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:43,805
I'm coming!

1003
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:45,773
Yeah, it's fine. It came out.

1004
01:05:45,774 --> 01:05:48,176
<i>It's fine, it was just a lollipop in--</i>

1005
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:49,210
<i>It's all right.</i>

1006
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:03,324
What could possibly possess you

1007
01:06:03,325 --> 01:06:06,628
to give a toddler
a known choking hazard?

1008
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:10,732
Don't lecture me, Eliza.
I could just as easily lecture you.

1009
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:14,169
Really? For what?
For doing all the idiotic errands?

1010
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:17,105
For listening to mothers in the park
who need to be medicated?

1011
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:19,974
While you get to go to work
with real adults

1012
01:06:19,975 --> 01:06:22,500
and have normal
adult conversation.

1013
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:24,512
Yeah, like having Morris
ream me out

1014
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:26,681
because I had to leave work
to take care of Lucas?

1015
01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:29,946
You mean those kind of normal,
adult conversations?

1016
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:34,522
You got an envelope at home today,
by the way.

1017
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:36,854
Some messenger guy delivered it.

1018
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:40,655
Yeah, right.

1019
01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:44,732
He--

1020
01:06:44,733 --> 01:06:47,569
He helped me
carry my bags upstairs,

1021
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:49,971
and so I let him
come in for a while.

1022
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:50,872
You what?

1023
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:54,240
I let him come in,
and he blew up balloons.

1024
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:59,080
You let a messenger
come into our apartment

1025
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:02,049
and decorate
for our daughter's birthday?

1026
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:06,819
His name was Mikesh,
and he was just being nice.

1027
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:12,260
He looked at me
like I was a person

1028
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:16,629
who might still have something
worthwhile to say.

1029
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:20,435
I always tell you that you have
something worthwhile to say.

1030
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:21,636
You--

1031
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:24,672
You need a stranger
to tell you that?

1032
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:28,233
Was he good-looking or....?

1033
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:36,808
He looked at me like I might still
be somebody worth looking at.

1034
01:07:39,054 --> 01:07:44,423
How could you not know
that you're worth looking at?

1035
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:54,200
Were you attracted to him?

1036
01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:58,373
Were you?

1037
01:07:58,374 --> 01:08:04,437
It's just that you never look
at me that way anymore, Avery.

1038
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:09,441
Do you look at me that way?

1039
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:13,778
No, not really. Not enough.

1040
01:08:19,928 --> 01:08:24,999
But I still love you, Avery.
I really love you, but--

1041
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,262
But what?

1042
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:31,770
It's just that

1043
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:38,946
every day from the second I wake up
till the second I pass out cold,

1044
01:08:38,947 --> 01:08:41,883
my day, like the day of almost
every other mother I know,

1045
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:48,414
is made up of a series of concrete,
specific actions.

1046
01:08:48,724 --> 01:08:51,459
And they're actions that kind of

1047
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:54,656
wear away at passion,
if you know what I mean.

1048
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:58,833
The actions
are petty and small like....

1049
01:08:58,834 --> 01:09:04,405
Like refilling coffee cups
or folding underwear.

1050
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:09,911
But they accumulate
in this really debilitating way

1051
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:14,473
that diminishes my ability to focus
on almost anything else.

1052
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:19,954
Bigger things like, you know,
ideas or...

1053
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:27,128
...politics or dreams
of a better life.

1054
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:29,358
Well, what would be a better life?

1055
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:35,937
It wasn't always my ambition

1056
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:42,009
to supervise a team
of fatuous liberal arts graduates

1057
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:44,712
and edit their copy about traveling

1058
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:48,182
to places that we can't afford
to visit.

1059
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:50,885
When we had Clara,

1060
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:57,425
I got a job with healthcare
and a little bit of flexibility.

1061
01:09:57,426 --> 01:10:02,295
It was a decision that we made.
We made the decision together.

1062
01:10:02,564 --> 01:10:05,566
So I got a job that I can tolerate.

1063
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:10,094
No more, no less.

1064
01:10:12,207 --> 01:10:17,111
You're not the only one
who's made sacrifices, Eliza.

1065
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:20,448
Well, that still doesn't explain
why you can't pick up your socks.

1066
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:22,483
What do my socks
have to do with it?

1067
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:25,086
Your socks have everything
to do with it!

1068
01:10:29,124 --> 01:10:35,563
Eliza, all I wanted you
to do in that piece

1069
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:43,664
was to stop hiding behind irony
because it comes so easily to you.

1070
01:10:45,707 --> 01:10:50,511
I want to know
what you really think.

1071
01:10:50,512 --> 01:10:53,071
I want to know
what you really feel.

1072
01:10:54,550 --> 01:11:01,389
What makes you want to live
a life with passion,

1073
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:06,054
no matter how many socks
you have to pick up.

1074
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:11,265
What about that?

1075
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:19,035
[Elizabeth Mitchell's Jubilee]

1076
01:11:39,328 --> 01:11:40,595
Come on, Coupon.

1077
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:43,097
Come on, get out.

1078
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:46,367
Does Coupon have to be out here?

1079
01:11:47,568 --> 01:11:50,872
No, but Bodhi
just tripped over him.

1080
01:11:51,973 --> 01:11:53,307
Is that Bodhi crying?

1081
01:11:53,308 --> 01:11:54,809
Yeah, it is.

1082
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:56,844
Is Lily crying back in his face?

1083
01:11:56,845 --> 01:11:59,745
Unfortunately, yes.

1084
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:04,185
Did Sheila come back?

1085
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:05,846
Not yet.

1086
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:09,346
Don't worry.

1087
01:12:11,159 --> 01:12:12,393
You were right, you know?

1088
01:12:12,394 --> 01:12:13,961
Unbelievable.

1089
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:15,429
About what?

1090
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:18,089
About this.

1091
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:20,167
But I think I figured it out.

1092
01:12:20,168 --> 01:12:21,435
I just need a little more time to--

1093
01:12:21,436 --> 01:12:23,836
A couple more minutes,
and I'll be done.

1094
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:29,066
Everything's under control in here.

1095
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:40,386
Okay, and....

1096
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:43,457
Mom, everybody wants cake now.

1097
01:12:43,458 --> 01:12:44,892
And there has to be 6 purple candles

1098
01:12:44,893 --> 01:12:46,794
and one number 6 candle.

1099
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:49,764
Okay.

1100
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:50,788
Come here.

1101
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:53,200
What are you writing?

1102
01:12:56,204 --> 01:12:58,139
Just this thing.

1103
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:01,409
It has to be done by midnight.
It's kind of important.

1104
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:04,278
It means mommy
might get a real job.

1105
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:06,881
But I don't want you
to get a real job.

1106
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:10,318
Why not?
It's good when mommies work.

1107
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:11,919
It keeps mommies happy.

1108
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,856
It keeps them from being mean,
nasty, yelling mommies.

1109
01:13:15,857 --> 01:13:19,327
What about daddies?
Should daddies not work, too?

1110
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:21,529
Why moms and not dads?

1111
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:23,698
Enlighten me.

1112
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:28,336
'Cause moms do everything.
Dads only do some things.

1113
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:29,537
It's different.

1114
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:32,400
Hi, Lady.

1115
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:39,046
Mom, for my 7th birthday,
can I get a cat?

1116
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:41,949
Mom, can I?

1117
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:46,187
Lady? Lady, where are you?

1118
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:47,121
Mom?

1119
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:51,892
"Maybe" is the best I can do, okay?

1120
01:13:51,893 --> 01:13:56,056
No peeking!

1121
01:13:57,332 --> 01:13:59,700
Here it comes!

1122
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:32,333
Are ya 1?

1123
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:33,601
Are ya 2?

01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:35,136
Are ya 3?

Are ya 4?

1126
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:38,506
Are ya 5?

1127
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:40,708
No!

1128
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:42,543
You're 6!

1129
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:44,345
You're 6!

[Georgie Porgie]

1131
01:15:03,532 --> 01:15:05,693
Squeeze her again!

1132
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:14,141
Come on, you moron!
It's not even 7:00!

1133
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:17,278
It's a little girl's birthday party!

1134
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:22,375
Clara, Clara,
can you turn it down just a little?

1135
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:26,587
The parties we used to have
in this building, dear.

1136
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:28,556
I can't tell you.

1137
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:34,261
Everyone would drink gin
and smoke reefer

1138
01:15:34,262 --> 01:15:40,000
and dance and talk until dawn.

1139
01:15:40,001 --> 01:15:42,069
We used to argue a lot, too.

1140
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,538
This was a very political crowd,

1141
01:15:44,539 --> 01:15:49,477
very serious about their positions,
don't you know.

1142
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:53,778
No one would have dreamed
of complaining then.

1143
01:15:57,686 --> 01:15:59,887
Clara, crank it up!

1144
01:16:00,655 --> 01:16:02,289
Come on, everybody, let's jump!

1145
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:05,159
Jump as hard as you can!
Jump up and down!

1146
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,894
Jump, jump, jump!

1147
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:11,223
Come on, everybody, let's go!

1148
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:23,437
So your party's a big success.

1149
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:30,379
Well, until someone starts bleeding,
I'd have to agree.

1150
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:35,521
Sheila, I just--

1151
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:40,986
I am so incredibly sorry
I hurt you.

1152
01:16:42,397 --> 01:16:45,666
Look, I do remember
uttering the distinct phrase,

1153
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:47,657
"This does not leave this room."

1154
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:52,999
And by that I meant, "Do not use
this episode for your own ends."

1155
01:16:57,045 --> 01:16:58,779
Be that as it may,

1156
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:00,347
we always promised
that we'd tell each other

1157
01:17:00,348 --> 01:17:04,443
the minute we got pissed off,
and that's just what I did.

1158
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:08,923
All right, steady on, steady on.
Hair on the lip gloss.

1159
01:17:08,924 --> 01:17:10,991
I was just telling you
when I was pissed off

1160
01:17:10,992 --> 01:17:13,194
when it actually happened.

1161
01:17:13,195 --> 01:17:15,262
I know.

1162
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:19,266
You were just so funny about it,
you know?

1163
01:17:19,267 --> 01:17:21,535
I just....

1164
01:17:21,536 --> 01:17:23,103
I didn't think.

1165
01:17:24,404 --> 01:17:27,608
But you always
have to think, Eliza.

1166
01:17:28,109 --> 01:17:30,444
Bloody hell.

1167
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:32,613
My midwife told me
if I carry on eating sugar

1168
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:33,881
all through my third trimester,

1169
01:17:33,882 --> 01:17:37,484
I'm gonna give birth
to a 10-pound behemoth, maybe 12.

1170
01:17:37,485 --> 01:17:40,754
That would be extremely
uncomfortable to push out vaginally.

1171
01:17:40,755 --> 01:17:42,389
Don't say "vaginally."

1172
01:17:54,836 --> 01:18:00,641
You did a stupendous job
pulling everything together today.

1173
01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:03,736
I did, didn't I?

1174
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:06,347
I hope you don't mind,

1175
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:10,050
'cause I know how you feel
about these things, but--

1176
01:18:10,051 --> 01:18:15,155
I did get Clara the purple
iPod shuffle that she wanted.

1177
01:18:15,156 --> 01:18:17,424
You did?

1178
01:18:17,425 --> 01:18:20,661
That's kind of an expensive
present for a 6-year-old.

1179
01:18:20,662 --> 01:18:24,698
I mean, it's not really
in our economy, is it?

1180
01:18:24,699 --> 01:18:26,860
It's in our economy today.

1181
01:18:28,503 --> 01:18:31,305
The envelope,
came with the messenger.

1182
01:18:31,306 --> 01:18:34,741
Your friend, Mikesh?

1183
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:37,868
You didn't open it, did you?

1184
01:18:38,446 --> 01:18:41,244
It was addressed to you.

1185
01:18:56,798 --> 01:19:00,631
This is a check
for 24,000 dollars, Avery.

1186
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:06,604
What did you do?

1187
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:11,504
You know those books
that were being thrown out today?

1188
01:19:13,048 --> 01:19:17,751
One of them happened to be
a copy of Emerson's essays.

1189
01:19:17,752 --> 01:19:23,123
A first edition, which as you know,
is incredibly rare.

1190
01:19:23,124 --> 01:19:27,661
And this first edition also happened
to be inscribed,

1191
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:29,997
which significantly upped the value,

1192
01:19:29,998 --> 01:19:35,492
so I took it to Odyssey,
and I sold it.

1193
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:39,473
But you love Emerson.

1194
01:19:39,474 --> 01:19:41,999
You love that book!

1195
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:44,511
You didn't want to keep it?

1196
01:19:44,512 --> 01:19:47,981
Yeah, of course I wanted to keep it.

1197
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:51,685
I even had a messenger
over the check.

1198
01:19:51,686 --> 01:19:55,280
Seemed kinda classy.

1199
01:19:57,425 --> 01:20:02,963
I figured it's probably enough
to pay for Lucas' preschool

1200
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:04,658
for a couple of years.

1201
01:20:06,101 --> 01:20:09,399
And maybe even a dishwasher.

1202
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:15,275
Because I want you
to take some time and write.

1203
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:22,383
Your "mom-oir," whatever the hell
you call it, or something else.

1204
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:32,088
This is....
This is for you, because you--

1205
01:20:37,832 --> 01:20:39,199
Avery!

1206
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:11,465
Wait, put this somewhere safe.

1207
01:21:11,466 --> 01:21:14,696
I'll do it.

1208
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:30,484
Motherhood is about accepting
the limitations of time and energy,

1209
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:32,186
which stretch beyond you,

1210
01:21:32,187 --> 01:21:35,656
even if sometimes it feels
they could consume you.

1211
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:39,860
Search for and hold on
to your own true self.

1212
01:21:39,861 --> 01:21:43,421
If you lose that,
what kind of mother can you be?

1213
01:21:43,932 --> 01:21:45,466
Things are always changing,

1214
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:50,170
no matter how much we might
want things to stay the same.

1215
01:21:50,171 --> 01:21:52,539
You could take a picture
of your kids every single day,

1216
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:57,909
and every single day,
they'd just be getting older.

1217
01:21:58,213 --> 01:21:59,880
That's a fact.

1218
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:02,549
A heartbreaking fact.

1219
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:04,551
But still a fact.

1220
01:22:04,552 --> 01:22:08,422
So seize your days
and dwell in them fully.

1221
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:09,623
Look to your children

1222
01:22:09,624 --> 01:22:12,359
because they know how to inhabit
brief periods of time

1223
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,895
with extreme passion.

1224
01:22:14,896 --> 01:22:19,299
And for nothing more, really,
than the sake of those moments.

1225
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:25,500
They can help you remember that,
if you only slow down and let them.

1226
01:22:30,145 --> 01:22:37,016
Feel fortunate because chances
are good you actually might be.

Here, sweetie, come on.

Sound speed!

1241
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:31,271
Speeding.

1242
01:23:31,272 --> 01:23:33,399
And, action!

1243
01:23:35,376 --> 01:23:36,810
Come here!

1244
01:23:39,948 --> 01:23:41,582
Look at the movie down there!

1245
