1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:03,692
<i>Previously on</i> Political Animals:

2
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:06,201
Chinese got a downed sub
near our shore.

3
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:07,567
Holy son of a bitch.

4
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:10,571
So a hundred men are trapped
at the bottom of the ocean...

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,370
...getting slowly cooked
by nuclear radiation?

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,945
I am running against you...

7
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:18,412
...and I will resign
after we have saved those men.

8
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:20,210
This is how it works, Douglas.

9
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:23,288
You help me by giving me
everything I need to know...

10
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:26,789
...about your mother's plan. You
came to me, Douglas, remember?

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,623
There is a tsunami of bullshit that
comes with being in my family.

12
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,525
We're gonna turn Sean Reeves.

13
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:36,099
- Your tactics disgust me.
- You're already involved.

14
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:39,533
Congressman Reeves is having an
affair with your son Thomas.

15
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:43,267
You have a serious problem, and you
just keep adding fuel to the fire.

16
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,377
Sam, call an ambulance.

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,880
<i>The winches are lowered now...</i>

18
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,212
<i>...and we believe the salvage teams
are about to arrive at depth.</i>

19
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:56,321
<i>These divers are from the Navy's
elite Mobile Unit One out of Hawaii.</i>

20
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,322
<i>Tonight they risk their lives
for 100 Chinese strangers...</i>

21
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,426
<i>...stuck in 600 feet of water...</i>

22
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,925
<i>...13 miles off the
coast of San Diego.</i>

23
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,722
<i>The waiting's almost over now.</i>

24
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:10,198
<i>It's not just the lives of our
Navy divers and the Chinese crew.</i>

25
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,600
<i>I think we all know
what's at stake here.</i>

26
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,069
<i>Approaching with Cable Number 1.</i>

27
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,337
<i>Ten meters and closing.</i>

28
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,913
<i>Five meters.</i>

29
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,116
<i>Four...</i>

30
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,088
<i>...three...</i>

31
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,860
<i>...two...</i>

32
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,458
<i>...one.</i>

33
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:44,629
They wanted to keep him sedated until
all the cocaine is out of his system.

34
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,238
- I think they gave him too much.
- Mother.

35
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:50,308
Like I don't have enough anxiety
just for the overdose.

36
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:54,038
Dad, Mom,
can I talk to you for a second?

37
00:01:56,749 --> 00:02:00,082
So between the security at the
club and the three EMTs...

38
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,983
...there's a total of six
witnesses that we know of.

39
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,750
I spoke to Gary at the press
office. He's getting calls.

40
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:08,485
- We cannot cover this up.
- I'll call Bobby Cartwright.

41
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:12,256
- Now, he'll know what to do.
- We are not hiring a fixer.

42
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:16,459
Between phone videos and pictures
or some hospital flunky wanting...

43
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,230
...to release his medical
records. - Call Susan Berg.

44
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,965
- Mom, that is...
- Tell her we want to meet.

45
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,340
I don't have time to argue
with you about this. Just do it.

46
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,777
He's my twin brother.
I'd like to be here.

47
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:31,280
And I would give anything
to do the same thing.

48
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,612
But you and I have to help him
in other ways.

49
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:36,846
I'll stay with him.
Now, you do what you gotta do.

50
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,786
I'm gonna be right
here by his side.

51
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,464
They're gonna release him
in a day or so.

52
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,396
I want him to move in with us.

53
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:52,597
Would you and Anne set up the guest
room for him and get the house ready?

54
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:56,105
- We'll make his room perfect.
- She meant dump the booze.

55
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:59,837
I mean get his room ready, and yes,
get rid of whatever substances.

56
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,277
Just like last
January after rehab.

57
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,848
Yeah, a lot of good that did.

58
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,849
Little shit's never gonna learn.

59
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,397
- An allergic reaction?
- Yes.

60
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,471
To an antibiotic
that they prescribed for T.J.

61
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,200
And he went into
anaphylactic shock.

62
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,866
So they rushed him to the ER...

63
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,879
...and got some fluids in him,
some epinephrine.

64
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,382
- Thankfully, he's doing much better now.
- Okay.

65
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,948
- Are the hospital records available?
- Those are confidential.

66
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:48,718
- You two don't expect me to believe this.
- It's not important that you believe it.

67
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,058
What's important is that you
write down what I'm telling you.

68
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:56,191
I don't transcribe press releases.
It's my job to discern the truth.

69
00:03:56,369 --> 00:04:00,669
- What you said doesn't have a whiff of it.
- Susan, I would like you to write it anyway.

70
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,435
I won't use my reputation
or that of my paper...

71
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:08,513
...to quell the speculation surrounding
T.J. I just... I won't do it.

72
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:13,179
And if I were willing
to breach National Security...

73
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,786
Mom.

74
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,752
- And give you a story
in exchange for this?

75
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,059
I'm listening.

76
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:24,253
I want you to know
that as secretary of state...

77
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,230
...I would never do anything
to deceive the American public.

78
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,398
But as a mother...

79
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,562
...I would do anything
to help my son.

80
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,644
There is a Chinese submarine lying
on the floor of the Pacific Ocean...

81
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,438
...off the coast of San Diego.

82
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:45,474
The Chinese are pretending it's not there,
that they weren't caught spying on us...

83
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,086
...and they're willing
to let their own men die.

84
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:53,320
President Garcetti is doing
everything he can to rescue them.

85
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,250
Douglas is headed out there now.

86
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:59,421
There's room on the plane, and you would
be the only press person on the ground...

87
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,829
...with unlimited access
to the rescue operation.

88
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,729
Oh.

89
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,395
Oh. Didn't know you
were all here.

90
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,303
Annie. Babe, hi. You, um...

91
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,172
You remember Susan Berg, right?

92
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,473
- We've met.
- Nice to see you again.

93
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,740
- Hi, Annie.
- Hi.

94
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:20,044
- Hey, what are these? Ahem.
- Oh, stuff for T.J.'s room.

95
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,117
- I feel like I'm interrupting.
- You're not interrupting.

96
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,158
Douglas and Susan were just getting
ready to fly to San Diego.

97
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,262
Isn't that right?

98
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,690
- Cool.
- Heh.

99
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,834
Hi, Alice.

100
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,870
Well, did he say when or where?

101
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:46,068
Okay. Yeah. No, I'll tell her.
Ahem.

102
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:52,016
Uh, DCM Han. He wants to meet with you
immediately. He's on his way over.

103
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,557
I asked you not to get involved,
Madam Secretary.

104
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:01,989
And you do the opposite.

105
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:04,561
You said you could not
get involved, Li Bao.

106
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:08,360
- We are saving your men.
- You're making a mistake.

107
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,230
Your government must cease
all rescue operations.

108
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:12,894
The hardware is too valuable.

109
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,836
We cannot have the CIA poking
around our technology.

110
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:18,909
You hardware is your
priority, Li Bao?

111
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,739
The truth is, Elaine...

112
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:23,074
...orders have
been communicated.

113
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,707
If you try to rescue them, the crew
will be forced to scuttle the ship.

114
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:32,153
You mean releasing the nuclear
material off of California?

115
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,885
Twenty-two million people live
along that coastline.

116
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,894
- Are you insane?
- There is nothing I can do.

117
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,862
You can get Tong on the line.
Now.

118
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:45,402
You are not setting off an underwater
dirty bomb along our coast.

119
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,869
This is above Tong.

120
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,769
Who is above your president?

121
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,436
Navy intelligence.

122
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,569
The only way to avoid
catastrophe...

123
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,942
...is for the United
States to stand down.

124
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,291
You had a productive morning.

125
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,523
Got my piece? It's
amazing, isn't it?

126
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,263
Uh, yeah, the sub story is...
It's amazing.

127
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:53,462
A nuclear-powered Chinese warship
marooned off the California coast.

128
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,800
Lives hanging in the balance.

129
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,342
This is gonna be everywhere,
and, you know, we had it first.

130
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:02,140
It's such big news that no one
will notice the story...

131
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:06,149
...about Thomas Hammond's
adverse reaction to antibiotics?

132
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,947
I'm your editor, though.
It's my job to notice.

133
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,282
- Spit it out. I'm in a hurry.
- Right.

134
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,857
Hopping on a State
Department jet with Douglas.

135
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:16,961
I have access. I have a vantage
point on a huge incident...

136
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,391
...no other reporter has.

137
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,492
Never thought I would accuse you of being
in the back pocket of the Hammond family.

138
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,727
Then don't.

139
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:28,670
You're saying these stories have
nothing to do with one another?

140
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,833
Don't overthink it, Alex.
You bitch about losing eyeballs.

141
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,741
I just brought a few more back
to our dear old <i>Globe.</i>

142
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:38,350
And I'll bring back even more when I
report the submarine being raised.

143
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,045
So just keep your
eye on the inbox.

144
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,486
"President Hammond is a dog..."

145
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:52,893
...and only a fool would fault a
dog for rooting in the trash.

146
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:56,694
But a first lady wielding an
intellect, drive and individuality...

147
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,064
...unlike any before her
ought to know better.

148
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,001
What sort of example
does she set...

149
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:04,768
...standing by her dog husband
with a sculpted smile...

150
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:08,004
...responding to the parade
of finger-pointing bimbos...

151
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,674
"...with her craven trill of 'no
comment' after 'no comment'?"

152
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:16,379
This is not opinion.
It's judgment.

153
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:20,048
The first family
is phony good-old-boy-ism...

154
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,921
...and empty
women-first chatter.

155
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,927
This is very clever.

156
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:28,430
It is also very mean.
You're better than this.

157
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:32,628
Because it isn't worthy? Or because a
female opinion gets different scrutiny?

158
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:35,136
- Bullshit.
- There are eight opinion columnists...

159
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,400
...at this paper, all men.

160
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,045
You'll have to excuse me now.

161
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,387
A long-term damage
to the maritime industry...

162
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,586
...could reach easily into the
tens of billions of dollars.

163
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,061
For the population
along the western seaboard...

164
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:04,362
...health effects are hard to
predict but nevertheless certain.

165
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,404
That's a hell of a thank-you
for trying to rescue their men.

166
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:10,736
Mr. President. We agree
that the threat is a bluff.

167
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,538
Even if they meant to bluff,
they've said it now.

168
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,045
The Chinese have to follow
through to save face.

169
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,945
Can we agree that the rescue
attempt is off the table?

170
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,815
Chinese naval intelligence is not
in charge of the Chinese military.

171
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:27,926
I get the sense that President Tong needs
to reassert control over these admirals.

172
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:31,427
- You get the sense?
- They were caught spying off our shores.

173
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:35,158
We're attempting to do the humane
thing by rescuing their crew...

174
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,427
...and now we're expected
to stand down...

175
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,936
...because this bunch of thugs
who are not even in charge...

176
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,904
...are threatening us?

177
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,133
GARCETTl:
Elaine.

178
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,110
We didn't pick this fight.
The Chinese did.

179
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,478
I'm sure they don't wanna let their admirals
start a third world warjust to save face.

180
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,587
No, Elaine's right.
We tell them now...

181
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,451
...and in no uncertain terms
that this will not stand.

182
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,114
- Mr. President...
GARCETTl: Fred.

183
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,520
I appreciate your opinion.

184
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:05,755
But this is exactly the type of
decision people elected me to make.

185
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,801
- You keep the rescue ships in place.
- Yes, sir.

186
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,437
GARCETTl: Barry, schedule an
address from the Oval Office.

187
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,402
Yes, sir.

188
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,501
Elaine.

189
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,405
- I'd like you to help me write the speech.
- Yes, sir.

190
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,721
You're sure fond
of that bathroom.

191
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,023
What's that mean?

192
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,333
Oh, nothing.

193
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,992
Regularity's the first thing
that goes when you age.

194
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,638
So enjoy it while you can.

195
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:51,803
Okay, you do the extreme room makeover
and I'll case the place for drugs.

196
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:55,242
You think T.J. Keeps drugs inside
the secretary of state's house?

197
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,541
Well, of course he does.
He's an addict.

198
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,744
I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere
in here he hasn't hidden a go-go boy.

199
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,647
- Oh, let me help you with that.
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.

200
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,888
Grass-fed filet?

201
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,660
The spaghetti alla
panna's better.

202
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,227
Your whole life has been
like this, hasn't it?

203
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,703
First-class, chauffeurs
and private chefs.

204
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:25,369
Bodyguards and
bomb-sniffing dogs.

205
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,707
- Paparazzi at my junior prom.
- Heh. Okay. I get it.

206
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,782
Yeah? Did someone film you dancing
to the Backstreet Boys...

207
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:35,545
...before you were old enough to
realize tuxedo shorts weren't cool?

208
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,689
I remember that video.

209
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,788
<i>Saturday Night Live
</i> did a great spoof.

210
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,294
What was it like?

211
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,264
Growing up in the White House?

212
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,725
Thank you.

213
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,763
This is starting to sound
a little reporter-y.

214
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,908
No, I'm just
curious, personally.

215
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,270
I mean, l...

216
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:02,437
We... Every reporter in D.C. Spent those
eight years peering into your family...

217
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,379
...trying to figure out
what made your parents tick.

218
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,416
What makes your parents tick?

219
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,818
- L...
- Exactly.

220
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:14,391
When you're a kid, they're all you know.
So who knows? I can tell you this much.

221
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,724
All the stuff that people
obsessed about over them...

222
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,958
...all the good things people
wrote, all the nasty shit...

223
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:26,070
...all the movies, the insider
tell-alls, none of it captured them.

224
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,036
You least of all.

225
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,924
Lesterjust called.
I think you know what he said.

226
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,993
You questioned my integrity.
I wanted a second opinion.

227
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,930
I thought that you wanted
to be ajournalist...

228
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,293
...not a noisemaker.

229
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:59,301
He's a pig, Hal. And she's
his willing accomplice.

230
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,099
All the men are afraid
to write the truth about her...

231
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,936
...because they don't want
to be labeled antifeminist.

232
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,010
They won't be afraid
to write anymore.

233
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,046
Let the Elaine Hammond
pile-on begin.

234
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:14,619
Your piece runs tomorrow,
first page of the op-ed.

235
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,649
Lester's running it?

236
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:22,182
Congratulations, Susan.
You got what you wanted.

237
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,590
I hope you're ready for it.

238
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:45,213
I have no idea
where these hands came from.

239
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,381
They're not my hands.

240
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,018
Mine are paws.

241
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,657
But they're not your
mother's either.

242
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,363
I'm not sure who they belong to.

243
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:06,600
I remember that first year
in the White House...

244
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:09,673
...was the worst
year of my life.

245
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,233
Everything...

246
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,209
...I always dreamed of...

247
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,782
...the job I'd coveted ever since I
was a young man, I finally had it.

248
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:23,650
And I was miserable as hell.

249
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:29,627
A fourth of my term had passed, and I
hadn't accomplished a single thing...

250
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,956
...that I'd set out to do.

251
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,564
I used to walk the
halls at night...

252
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:38,191
...stare up at the faces
of my predecessors...

253
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,270
...and think to myself:

254
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:44,068
"Every one of them
is a better man than me."

255
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,939
And then one night...

256
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,177
...out of the East Room...

257
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:56,284
...I hear this most
glorious sound.

258
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,913
I poke my head in,
and there you are...

259
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,923
...8 years old...

260
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:06,258
...playing some kind of classical
piece so effortlessly.

261
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,593
You turned around
when you heard me.

262
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:13,898
You let out a crazy laugh, and you
went skipping off down the hallway.

263
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,742
And after that...

264
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,109
...I used to hide around the
corner from the East Room...

265
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,272
...just to listen to you play.

266
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,147
It was something so simple...

267
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,254
...but it brought
me so much peace.

268
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,326
And I don't know
why I never told you that.

269
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,938
These hands.

270
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,135
They're not my hands, T.J.

271
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,004
They're yours.

272
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,552
GARCETTl: "You do not come
spying in our backyard..."

273
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,387
...and make threats."

274
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:14,056
It's tempting to soft-pedal...

275
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,201
...but speeches don't
come bolder than this.

276
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,395
And your words should
match it, sir.

277
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,510
History will judge me by this.

278
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:30,137
If this goes south, my entire
presidency just melts away.

279
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:33,341
If it goes well,
you'll be a hero.

280
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,079
And you'll be unbeatable.

281
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:39,519
Either way, it's the right
thing to do, Mr. President.

282
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:45,196
You know, Elaine... Thank you.

283
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:50,028
- This moment, this is why I asked you
to run with me in the first place.

284
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,692
You wouldn't have been elected.

285
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,931
You needed the conservative votes in
our party, which Collier brought.

286
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,502
- Good luck, Mr. President.
- Thank you.

287
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,614
Ten seconds, sir.

288
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:14,686
In five, four, three.

289
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,587
My fellow Americans.

290
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,130
As many of you know...

291
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,960
...a Chinese nuclear
submarine...

292
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:26,468
...lies 13 miles off the coast
of Southern California.

293
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:31,133
As of last night, on my orders, a
Navy salvage group is headed there...

294
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:34,471
...to rescue the 100
Chinese sailors aboard.

295
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,745
However, we have
since learned...

296
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,908
...that the crew were given
orders to destroy their own ship.

297
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:45,580
The released radiation would wreak havoc
upon the entire western seaboard.

298
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,387
Let me be clear.

299
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,323
We would consider
it nothing less...

300
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,431
...than an act of war
against the United States.

301
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,126
You do not come spying in our
backyard and make threats.

302
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,908
When I was your age, I was
the original Girl Gone Wild.

303
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:07,603
Dancing on tabletops
and clubs all over town.

304
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,110
Why did you settle down?

305
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,412
Oh, it was my second husband.

306
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:15,417
He was Elaine's
stepfather, Dale Barrish.

307
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:19,250
He treated me like a queen,
but he was just boring as shit.

308
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,125
- You didn't love him?
- Well, there's all kinds of love, isn't there?

309
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,923
I mean, I loved his kindness...

310
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:29,365
...and I loved what
he did for Elaine.

311
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:34,973
He taught her the preamble to the
Constitution before she was 5.

312
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,132
He just saw abilities in her...

313
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,778
...that I just wasn't
capable of seeing.

314
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,607
But it just wasn't...

315
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:47,218
...the head-over-heels-love
kind of thing, you know?

316
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,487
That cushion you're sitting on,
I bet there's a zipper on it.

317
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,423
Oh.

318
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,022
Yep. It sure does.

319
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:08,003
That little shit.

320
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,968
Oh, my God. That filet, it
could turn vegetarians.

321
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,705
You're leaving all that?

322
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,211
Knock yourself out.

323
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,372
Maybe just a little.

324
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,517
- Mm-hm. Really good.
- Ha, ha.

325
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,991
- What's so funny?
- Watching you down my food.

326
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,558
Annie loves to eat too.

327
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,218
It's just, well, you know,
she's gotta worry about...

328
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,661
- What? Squeezing into a wedding dress?
- Yeah.

329
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,700
- Not really on my radar.
- So you and your boyfriend...?

330
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:41,862
Split up. He's back to being
just my editor now.

331
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,400
So tell me more about Anne.

332
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,371
Like what?

333
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,209
Well, your fiancée
is about to become a Hammond.

334
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:55,683
What do you think after having been under
that magnifying glass your whole life?

335
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,118
It must be tough
to be ajournalist sometimes.

336
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,282
Acting like you're someone's
friend one minute, and the next...

337
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,792
...you've got them over a barrel. - Oh.
You put yourself over that barrel.

338
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,194
- You ever stop playing people?
- You're talking to me about playing?

339
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,029
Your mother lied, said she
wasn't running for president.

340
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,900
Don't take it so personally. You've had
it out for her for the last 15 years.

341
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:18,406
You've made a career out of trying
to drive her name into the ground.

342
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,135
Now you're riding her coattails.

343
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:23,975
When I became ajournalist, I was taught
my job was to keep politicians honest.

344
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,140
And who was keeping you honest?

345
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,550
It's best, if we want to make it
to San Diego...

346
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:34,556
...without some double-homicide situation,
to declare your mother off-limits.

347
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,561
Sure I can't interest you two
in a glass of wine?

348
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,221
- Sure.
- Me too.

349
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,663
Here, cocaine. Dump it.

350
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:52,308
These look like they have
little designs on them.

351
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,774
Are those bunnies?

352
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,106
Uh, I think they're unicorns.

353
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,647
Oh. Dump them.

354
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:07,191
Now, this, I can think of a more
interesting way to get rid of.

355
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,284
- You're joking.
- Some of my friends in California...

356
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:11,952
...get this from their doctors.

357
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,360
I mean, it can be therapeutic.

358
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,864
Okay, I haven't
smoked since college.

359
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,435
I'm not doing it now
with my fiancé's grandmother.

360
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,367
You know, sometimes
after the show...

361
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:24,167
...somebody would give us a tip
of a couple of reefers.

362
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:29,110
Us girls would stay up all night drinking,
smoking, sexually experimenting.

363
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,875
- This is a terrible idea.
- Anne, sweetheart.

364
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:36,111
You could stand a couple
of terrible ideas.

365
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,182
- More wine, sir?
- No, thank you.

366
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,295
I think we're all good here.

367
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:48,459
I have enough trouble holding
my tongue when I'm sober.

368
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,533
We're off the record.

369
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,828
Say whatever you want.

370
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:55,461
Listen, the way that I came at
you before, way out of line.

371
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,902
Oh, it's only fair.

372
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:00,909
I should be able to take character
impeachment as easily as I give it, right?

373
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:04,879
Honestly, though, there was a part of
me that loved some of what you wrote.

374
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,385
The stuff about my dad?

375
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:11,488
How it used to drive
him bat-shit crazy.

376
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,147
I campaigned for him in college,
you know?

377
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,317
Drove four hours
to see him speak.

378
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:20,397
It was one of the most
inspirational moments of my life.

379
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,055
And you know what
the best part was?

380
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,258
- Hmm?
- Your mom.

381
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:27,496
It opened my eyes that a woman could
be that strong and independent...

382
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:32,166
...and still be,
I don't know, a wife and mother.

383
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,835
What was yours like?
Your mother.

384
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:38,346
She died a few years ago.

385
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,451
Breast cancer.

386
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:42,412
Why?

387
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:46,580
You may know more about my mother than I
do, and I don't know anything about yours.

388
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,555
It just doesn't seem right.

389
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:53,061
She didn't care for my columns about your
mom. I thought I was being principled.

390
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:57,429
She thought I was just doing it to
set myself apart from the world.

391
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,899
She may have been right.

392
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,597
I thought I was being principled when
I told you about my mother's run.

393
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,875
We all make mistakes.

394
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,808
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Hammond.</i>

395
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,813
<i>We need to make a stop in Dallas
to wait out some thunderstorms.</i>

396
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:15,942
<i>But we promise to get you back in the
air to San Diego as soon as possible.</i>

397
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,248
Bright side.

398
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:20,388
We can finish this bottle.

399
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,924
Mm.

400
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,456
Thank you.

401
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:33,962
Heh. I know it's a shoebox,
but there's lots of glass.

402
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,336
And I'm the youngest staffer
with four walls.

403
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:41,445
Like Virginia Woolf said, all a
writer needs is a room of one's own.

404
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:42,910
Right?

405
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,948
Well, I'm happy for
you, sweetheart.

406
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:48,780
Are you?

407
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:52,754
Well, I came here to celebrate
your new office, so l...

408
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,123
Let's not do this.

409
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:58,623
Mom, please just say whatever
the hell you're thinking...

410
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:02,289
...so I don't have to spend all
of lunch trying to decipher it.

411
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,970
I'm proud of you. You've
accomplished a great deal.

412
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:07,798
But?

413
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:12,137
I just don't think that Elaine Hammond
is the ogre that you present.

414
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:16,205
No, and it seems naive that someone
in their 20s, not yet married...

415
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:20,784
...uses the infidelities of someone's
marriage as a lightning rod.

416
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:25,116
Yeah, I think once you've learned how
much work it takes, you'll be less...

417
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:32,222
I am the only woman with an
op-ed column at this paper.

418
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:35,332
You'd never know it by the way
you shred Elaine Hammond.

419
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,800
And do you really hate her that much, or
is she just an easy mark to get this?

420
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:44,332
What a spiteful thing to say.

421
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:45,840
This is resentment.

422
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:49,811
You cut your career short, so how
dare I become successful in mine?

423
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,972
No, I left medicine
to have a family.

424
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,677
And if I hadn't done that, I think it's
fairly unlikely you would be here.

425
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:03,721
I'm sorry. I didn't come
into town for this.

426
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:08,322
I came to see you
and to have a nice lunch.

427
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,230
So let's go, please.

428
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,028
I'm supposed to meet Liz at 2.

429
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,903
You scheduled a half hour
for us to eat?

430
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,410
She's painting the townhouse. She
asked me to come by and take a look.

431
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,913
Second-year residents
can't make their schedule.

432
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:31,849
Go eat with Liz. Talk shop.

433
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:35,083
- Oh, Suze.
- No, really.

434
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,562
Okay.

435
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,870
I wish my mother were here.

436
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,771
She at least would have had the
sense to smuggle in a flask.

437
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,913
Heh. Come on, you've done
everything you could, sugar.

438
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:59,608
Now it's up to God
and the doctors.

439
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:03,117
And the Chinese. All of whom, let's
face it, work in mysterious ways.

440
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,655
I don't think I ever fully
realized until today...

441
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:08,792
...how much pressure
you were under.

442
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,656
Well, after spending
the last 12 hours...

443
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,661
...watching over T.J., I could
say the same thing to you.

444
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:18,963
He wouldn't be lying here if we'd given
the same devotion and passion...

445
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,004
...to his well-being that we
gave to our political careers.

446
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,800
Apples and oranges, sugar.

447
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,910
As soon as he started to go
downhill in high school...

448
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,978
...I should've packed
up and left D.C.

449
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,639
- We've been through this.
- We made a choice, Bud.

450
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,012
We put our goals for
this country...

451
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,984
...ahead of the
well-being of our child.

452
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:42,923
And that is a decision we have to
live with for the rest of our lives.

453
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:49,991
Hey, that congressman.

454
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,499
Sean Reeves.

455
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,605
You got pretty upset when his
name came up last night.

456
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:58,869
Is he the one that changed his
vote on the Child Protection Act?

457
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,705
Right around Christmas
as I recall.

458
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,540
- He and T.J. Were having an affair.
- What?

459
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:07,481
Sean ended up going back to his
wife, and it broke T.J.'s heart.

460
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:11,114
Someone found out
they were seeing each other...

461
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:14,622
...and threatened to out Sean
if he didn't change his vote.

462
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,488
So he did.

463
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:19,152
- Who was it?
- A Democrat.

464
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,299
One of our own, if you
can believe that.

465
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,230
Tell me who it was, sugar.

466
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:28,531
Just so if I see him
at a cocktail party...

467
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,335
...I can spill a glass
of wine on him.

468
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,843
Ha, ha. Okay. Hold on a minute.

469
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:40,576
You actually have
a Backstreet Boys playlist.

470
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:45,382
Oh. I don't know
if anybody told you, but, um...

471
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:49,322
<i>Backstreet's back, all right</i>

472
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,758
- I still got those dance moves.
- Ha-ha-ha.

473
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:53,760
I might even have my
tuxedo shorts somewhere.

474
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:56,490
Ha-ha-ha. You should wear
them to your wedding.

475
00:28:56,668 --> 00:29:00,661
Yeah, uh, I don't know if Annie
would like that so much.

476
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,238
She's a designer...

477
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,774
...so God forbid that I clash
with the table settings.

478
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:12,606
Um... I showed you mine,
now you show me yours.

479
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:16,587
- Hey...
- Yeah, no, no, no.

480
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,418
- Let's see. Deadline playlist.
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.

481
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:24,790
- Treadmill playlist. Insomnia playlist.
- Yes, sorry. That is my life.

482
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:29,057
Who is Alex, and why does he get
his own playlist?

483
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,635
Your ex. I'm sorry.

484
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:38,469
We were living together,
and he had an affair...

485
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:41,271
...with a woman we
both work with...

486
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,811
...so I moved out.

487
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:46,544
Can I tell you a secret?

488
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:49,710
I think that you're a little
drunk, so watch yourself.

489
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,253
Drunk secrets are the best.

490
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:58,028
I had sex on this plane
the last time I was on it.

491
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,422
- With my dad?
- Jesus, no.

492
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:05,264
- With anotherjournalist.
- Oh.

493
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:09,270
I was trying to get over my ex, but
of course, it made things worse.

494
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,912
I know she doesn't like me.

495
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,243
- Oh.
- She's never liked me.

496
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:24,354
She doesn't think that I am good enough
for her precious prince-of-the-world son.

497
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,984
You know what she talked about
the first time we met?

498
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,423
- Hmm?
- Douglas' ex-girlfriend.

499
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:32,859
The Lauren bitch.

500
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:37,360
Lauren's a Rhodes Scholar.

501
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:41,471
Heh. No wonder she loved her.
She was a carbon copy of her.

502
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:44,665
You know, I like this Anne.
She's my kind of gal.

503
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,107
- You ought to let her out more often.
- Oh.

504
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,006
Mm. And the phone calls.

505
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,117
She calls him at 3:00 in
the morning just to chat.

506
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:55,616
They don't think it's weird.

507
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:59,655
I mean, I don't care where
they work. That's weird.

508
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:00,950
Don't get carried away.

509
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,457
That's my grandson
you're talking about.

510
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:07,826
She will always be number one
on his speed dial.

511
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:11,833
- I'll have to live with being number two.
- No. Absolutely not.

512
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,563
You can't settle for that.
Are you kidding me?

513
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:18,800
You gotta say to him, "I am
number one." Now say that.

514
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,508
- I'm number one.
- No. Louder.

515
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,806
And stick your boobs out
when you say it.

516
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:26,473
I am number one.

517
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,253
- I am number one.
- There you go.

518
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,252
There's hope for you yet.

519
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:36,252
Now, will you please stop
bogarting that thing?

520
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:42,657
Ah.

521
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,559
Nice to see you've redecorated.

522
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:50,198
President Turner was one
tasteless son of a bitch.

523
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,400
Plus, he tore out
my bowling alley.

524
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:56,035
Never trust anyone
who doesn't enjoy bowling.

525
00:31:56,214 --> 00:32:00,275
- How are you, Mr. President?
- Mr. President. Welcome home.

526
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,282
- Thank you.
GARCETTl: Have a seat, please.

527
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:05,513
Thanks for setting this up,
Fred, on such short notice.

528
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:06,918
Sure.

529
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,855
Bud, I should probably tell you
before you get started.

530
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,895
Whatever information you have
into our current situation...

531
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:14,544
...it's not likely
to change my mind.

532
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,792
- About the Chinese sub?
GARCETTl: Hmm.

533
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,698
Rescue it. It's what I'd do
if I were still in the chair.

534
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:24,808
- You said you had intel.
- I do, Fred, and it's important.

535
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,466
You'll see.

536
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:29,476
Generally speaking, Paul,
and with all due respect...

537
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:33,549
...I think you're slick,
uncommitted and opportunistic.

538
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:36,380
You lack the backbone
to be a great leader.

539
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:38,886
But you're not without
your principles.

540
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:41,617
I guess this is where I say,
"Thank you, Bud."

541
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,226
Fred here, on the other hand.

542
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:46,659
Well, I'll be damned
if I know what makes him tick.

543
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:49,664
Then again, having run the CIA
as long as you did...

544
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:54,328
...I guess any sort of principles,
any kind of human compunction...

545
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,473
...would just get in the way.

546
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:00,270
You have any idea what I was doing
while you were dodging the draft?

547
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:05,306
I served this country with honor
for over three decades.

548
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,815
You wouldn't know honor
if it sucked your cock...

549
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,478
...and stroked your balls, Fred.
- That's a beautiful metaphor.

550
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,590
Bud, why don't you tell me
what's on your mind?

551
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,953
The Child Protection Act.

552
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:21,631
Last December, when you were
teaching your boy to ski...

553
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,529
...he turned
Congressman Sean Reeves...

554
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:28,263
...by threatening to disclose
the man's sexual orientation...

555
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,339
...which is not as
publicly advertised.

556
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,210
It just fell in our laps.

557
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:38,839
Would you swear that on oath before
a House Oversight committee?

558
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,542
He used your name, Mr.
President.

559
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,516
He told folks that the scheme
was your redheaded stepchild.

560
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:49,392
He's just pissed because
his queer son...

561
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,460
...was having an
affair with Reeves.

562
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:54,860
Or were you gonnajust leave
that part out, Mr. President?

563
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,661
- No, I was getting there.
- Yeah.

564
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:59,393
But I wanted to do this first.

565
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:05,064
You son of a bitch!
I'd kick your...

566
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:08,837
Fred! Bud. Jesus! Guys.

567
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:11,709
- Bitch!
- That's it. That's enough. That's enough!

568
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,510
Bud.

569
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,913
You harm my family again...

570
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,853
...and I swear to
ever-loving God...

571
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:23,823
...I will wipe your existence
from the face of this Earth.

572
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,201
Probably ought to get
some ice on that.

573
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,807
Drunk secret. I, uh...

574
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:43,911
...proposed to Anne
while we were on Ecstasy.

575
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,518
Okay. That beats
joining the mile-high club.

576
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:52,179
And we've been planning our
wedding for two years...

577
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:56,053
...because I'm not really sure
either one of us is ready to commit.

578
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,618
Do you love her?

579
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,423
Yeah. Totally.

580
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,732
- But?
- But...

581
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,461
It's like...

582
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:14,805
It's like you put on this
expensive tailored suit.

583
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:18,415
All right? And everybody tells
you how great you look in it.

584
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:22,542
But it doesn't really
fit quite right...

585
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:25,088
...unless you stand
perfectly still.

586
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:30,420
Love has never fit
quite right for me.

587
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,826
I was always certain about
my job, maybe too certain...

588
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:37,058
...but not with love.
- You've never settled.

589
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:38,896
You know? That takes courage.

590
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,265
You have never compromised
in your writing...

591
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:44,340
...so why should you compromise
in your personal life?

592
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:47,410
- There's a flip side no one tells you about.
- Oh.

593
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:50,638
You wake up one day, heh...

594
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,306
...and realize while you
were busy being brazen...

595
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:57,818
...making a name for yourself,
everyone made a life.

596
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:02,688
And then you're not uncompromising,
you're just sad. Heh.

597
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,293
Bullshit.

598
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,660
You...

599
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:09,900
...are gorgeous.

600
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,197
You're smart. You are...

601
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:16,271
A bitch who makes a living ripping other
people's lives to shreds in public.

602
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,202
Yes.

603
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,173
And...

604
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:23,944
...sexy.

605
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:30,053
- I wish that I had some of your courage.
- Heh.

606
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,451
Look at you, Douglas.

607
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:35,517
You're the youngest chief
of staff in State...

608
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,701
Wait.

609
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,898
Mom?

610
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,630
Oh, sweetie.

611
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:01,134
Where...? Where am I?

612
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,576
Oh, you're in the hospital.

613
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,910
Oh, my God.

614
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:09,314
Oh, I'm so sorry.

615
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,047
I didn't mean for this to happen.
I wasn't trying to hurt myself.

616
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:16,990
Don't worry about any of that.
Shh. Go back to sleep.

617
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,755
It's all gonna be okay.

618
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,531
How is he?

619
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,501
- What happened to you?
- Oh, nothing.

620
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,477
- He just woke up for a second.
- All right.

621
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:41,245
I'll stay with him. You need to
get back to the Situation Room.

622
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:43,580
It won't be long
before they contact that sub.

623
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:45,483
You know, it's freezing in here.

624
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,187
They need to bring him another
blanket or turn up the temperature.

625
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,658
- All right.
- Ask the nurses to have something...

626
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,353
...for him to eat when wakes up.

627
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:55,623
- Yeah.
- He needs to get some food in him.

628
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,964
That's all right. Just leave
him with me. Now go. Go on.

629
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:40,366
You know, most people, when they
get high, they get the munchies.

630
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:44,139
I get the drunkies. No, no. I didn't
mean to say that. No, that's wrong.

631
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:45,873
I get the drinkies.

632
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,258
Okay, what exactly is this?
It's delicious.

633
00:39:56,427 --> 00:40:00,329
It's Turkish delight. The Turkish
ambassador sent it over.

634
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:02,489
He's got a crush on Elaine.

635
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,725
It's a little on the
nose, if you ask me.

636
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,439
Don't do it, honey.

637
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:14,844
Don't do it to yourself anymore.

638
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:19,238
- I'm just using the bathroom.
- Hey, who are you talking to, huh?

639
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,442
I was a showgirl.
You think I don't know...

640
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:24,917
...what some of the girls had
to do to fit into our costumes?

641
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:28,388
Think I don't notice you getting
up halfway through every meal...

642
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:33,690
...and coming back from the ladies' room
light-headed and reeking of breath mints?

643
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:37,425
There's a lot of looking the
other way in this family, babe.

644
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:38,693
But not by me.

645
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:43,535
I think there's been
some kind of misunderstanding.

646
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:47,541
Okay. You don't have
to come clean to me.

647
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:52,375
But you gotta talk to Dougie about it.
You know, let him get you some help.

648
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:03,421
<i>The waiting's almost over now.</i>

649
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:07,121
<i>It's not just the lives of our
Navy divers and the Chinese crew.</i>

650
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,289
<i>I think we all know
what's at stake here.</i>

651
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:13,960
<i>Unit One, you are
clear for attach.</i>

652
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,833
<i>Repeat. Clear for attach.</i>

653
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:19,833
<i>Approaching with Cable Number 1.</i>

654
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,478
<i>Ten meters and closing.</i>

655
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:26,105
<i>Five meters.</i>

656
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,012
<i>Four.</i>

657
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,344
<i>Three.</i>

658
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:32,748
<i>Two.</i>

659
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:35,651
<i>One.</i>

660
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,293
<i>Cable 1 attached, Topside.</i>

661
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,159
<i>Cable 2 attached.</i>

662
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,666
<i>Command, this is Topside.</i>

663
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,737
<i>We're getting a message from the
sub, but it makes no sense.</i>

664
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:50,940
Send it through, Topside.

665
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:57,008
X-I-E-X-l-E? What is it, code?

666
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,672
It's alphabetized Chinese.

667
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:04,887
It means <i>xièxie.</i> "Thank you."

668
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:08,224
<i>Cable 4 attached. All
points secure, Topside.</i>

669
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:10,189
<i>Pull her up.</i>
