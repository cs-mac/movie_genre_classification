1
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,280
- We're kicking today.
- Yeah.

2
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,080
Wanna go?

3
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,520
- It's freezing outside.
- We've been inside all day!

4
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,240
- Let's get high.
- We've been getting high all day!

5
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,196
- We'll get high. When?
- Now!

6
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,960
I hate people who
get stoned and yap,

7
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,715
who talk shit and then regret it!

8
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,829
You're like that!

9
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,200
- I didn't say a word all night!
- Crapoid.

10
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,200
You've got a lit cig in your mouth,

11
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,031
one in your hand
and one in the ashtray.

12
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,398
You're gonna wake Vincenzoni!

13
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,351
Pentothal!

14
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,754
Be right down.

15
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,600
The moment has come.

16
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,558
Now I'll go downstairs
and she'll say it.

17
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,317
I wonder how she put
up with me for so long.

18
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,554
No matter what she says,
I have to forget it before noon.

19
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,272
Don't think about it.

20
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,400
In three years I've learned this,

21
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,640
while waiting in line at
the cafeteria, you can read, talk

22
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,517
do whatever you want,
but don't think!

23
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,630
You're in worse shape than I
thought... But the end is near.

24
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,719
"The end is near..." Their
commitment takes them so concise.

25
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,754
I'm dumping you,
it sounds pretty stupid.

26
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
My reasons are your total
lack of information,

27
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,311
your laziness and lack of dignity.

28
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,720
This is just what I needed.

29
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,075
You live past glories, but which?

30
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,676
Actually, you live
sitting down on yourself, you...

31
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,392
What do you do?

32
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,231
Night watch, comrades!
Everything fine?

33
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,392
All is well, thanks.

34
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,400
What does "I'm dumping you" mean?
That we won't make love anymore?

35
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,840
That we won't see each other?
That we won't say hello anymore?

36
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,320
None of this or maybe all of this.

37
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,120
It's the concept that counts:
I am dumping you.

38
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,880
I don't care about the mechanics.

39
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,552
Fascists!

40
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,640
- Run home, I'll...
- You'll what?

41
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,790
Bastards!

42
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,591
Get that asshole!

43
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,320
Did you do it?

44
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,389
No, it was...

45
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,149
Where is...?

46
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,993
- What are you doing?
- Getting something to drink.

47
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,153
Can you get me a glass of water
and turn up the heat?

48
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,633
Gross!

49
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,749
There's never a fucking clean glass!

50
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,836
Galileo!

51
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,156
Little pest!

52
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,391
Because coldness, the
real kind, can sit here,

53
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,956
in the pit of this dude's heart.

54
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,028
I'm a wolf, don't call me Fido.

55
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,237
You're beautiful, Robby!

56
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,954
- How do you do it?
- The gym.

57
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,276
It's late mom,
I have to go to school.

58
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,393
It's the spark plug.

59
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,839
Sergio!

60
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,280
Your egg sandwich!

61
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,477
Why didn't you take it?

62
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,040
Drive slowly!

63
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,632
Go to hell!

64
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,353
- Poor thing...
- Insane!

65
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,080
Here she is.

66
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,992
- Hello Ma'am!
- Good morning Ma'am.

67
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,678
I'm speechless.
Forgive them, they're vandals.

68
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,473
1968 was a...

69
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,752
I was saying that 1968
was an amazing period,

70
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,000
I got a bad deal though,

71
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,231
I fell in love
with a girl from Trieste and...

72
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,149
Kids!

73
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,320
Please!

74
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,639
Petrilli!

75
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,629
Zanardi.

76
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,995
Tomorrow I'll give you
a history test,

77
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,274
on the Second War
of Independence, okay?

78
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,674
- Sure.
- You do want to finish high school?

79
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,119
- Yes or no?
- Sure.

80
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,280
I assume you want
to go to college too,

81
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,875
or get a job,
so you'll need this piece of paper.

82
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,230
- Sure.
- See you tomorrow.

83
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,560
I have your homework.

84
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,438
Besides for Infante's,
they all stink.

85
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,194
Infante gets a B, rather an A.
Is that okay?

86
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,078
All the others literally stink.

87
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,028
Infante, come here.

88
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,440
I'm going out with Mirella today.

89
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,670
Some monster tits!

90
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,829
I'll ask...

91
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,229
Infante.

92
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,280
Good morning professor.

93
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,068
Zanardi, Colasanti and Petrilli
to the principal's office.

94
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,799
Thanks, excuse me.

95
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,160
Excuse the intrusion,

96
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,760
Colasanti, Zanardi
and Petrilli are here.

97
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,239
Come in.

98
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,120
No, stand up!

99
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,190
This man has a few things
to say to you!

100
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,320
I'm from police headquarters,
she has filed a report against you.

101
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,600
The accusation?

102
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,200
Trespassing in her yard,

103
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,920
torturing and killing her cat.

104
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,600
Don't be so concise!

105
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,480
These pigs crucified
a poor helpless creature,

106
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,960
mine or not, doesn't matter!

107
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,632
Actually it does.

108
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,749
- I'd like to say a word.
- Say it, Zanardi.

109
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,839
Say this word,

110
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,240
but before you spew out
your usual hogwash,

111
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,437
look what I found in my yard.

112
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,760
Your phone book.

113
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,440
You're finished,

114
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,840
I'll hound you until
you're behind bars!

115
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,638
Impossible, it was
in my pocket this morning!

116
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,077
This is a dirty fucking trap!

117
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,480
You stole it from my coat?

118
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,278
No, it wasn't me.

119
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,360
Do what you want. If you're
done, we'll go back to class.

120
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,720
You make me sick Zanardi,

121
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,600
you're pompous and arrogant,

122
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,240
you're a sadist!

123
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,240
Get out of here, you infect!
You too, worms!

124
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,673
Yes Ma'am!

125
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,790
Comrades, colleagues, cohabitants,

126
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,840
is there any coffee?

127
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,280
You're always the last to wake up.

128
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,191
Noodle soup, who wants some?

129
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,995
Fuck this...

130
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,759
Space.

131
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,232
I'm dumping you,
it's the concept that counts.

132
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,351
I'm dumping you,
I don't care about the mechanics.

133
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,549
I don't care about the mechanics...

134
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,515
Stop fucking slurping!

135
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,480
Ringo, didn't you notice
he's not doing well?

136
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,800
No.

137
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,199
Enrico!

138
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,759
The coffee is there.

139
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,274
- What's the weather like?
- I don't know.

140
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,880
Is there sugar in it?
Did you stir it?

141
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,915
Stir it yourself.

142
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,673
Anna?

143
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,880
Should I go take the exam?

144
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,871
I don't know, all I know
is that I'm late!

145
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,673
I don't know a damn thing!

146
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,440
Do you hear me?

147
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,715
See you tonight.

148
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,992
Wait, you didn't even give me
a kiss.

149
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:44,080
You wouldn't happen to have
five bills to lend me?

150
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,240
Yes, but don't get stoned
before the exam.

151
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,516
Are you crazy?
Not before or after, never!

152
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,669
Five?

153
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,474
Here.

154
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,240
I'll pay you back.
Five plus ten from last time...

155
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,958
I'll repay it all
at the end of the month.

156
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,952
Give me another kiss.

157
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,432
- Five plus ten...
- Yes, we'll add it up tonight.

158
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,189
- You're always rushing.
- I have to go to work!

159
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,160
I'm freaking out,
should I take the exam or not?

160
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,550
- What are your feelings?
- I feel I'm going to be late!

161
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,918
Get dressed, you'll get cold.

162
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,314
Five bills...

163
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,840
That's it,

164
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,240
I refuse to stay
in that shitty apartment!

165
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,280
Goodbye Bologna, I'll go to Naples!

166
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,317
Or Paris or Champagnol

167
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,080
or Morocco.

168
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,914
By now all departments
have been taken over...

169
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,034
I'm totally out of the loop.

170
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,760
Breakfast, morning breakfast...

171
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,479
Butter and jam in abundance!

172
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,596
"The index opposes
all other signs..."

173
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,028
Damn, I've only got
half a joint here!

174
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,388
"...as a differential class

175
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,640
in the same category

176
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,040
and not as a differential class."

177
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:16,040
Signs are deciphered,
appearances are not.

178
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,359
Signs are deciphered,

179
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,560
appearances must not be deciphered.

180
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:28,240
No way can appearances
be deciphered!

181
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,232
A tiny joint and the exam is done!

182
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,800
What's this smoke?

183
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,190
Smoking's bad, what the hell will I
tell your mom while I'm banging her?

184
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,911
Out!

185
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,471
- Jerking off makes you go blind.
- Go to class!

186
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,432
Get your ass to class.

187
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,840
- You wouldn't throw Materazzo out.
- No.

188
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,400
He's not the kind of guy
who let's himself get thrown out.

189
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,310
Out!

190
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,440
- See what the raw deal is?
- How many raw deals are there?

191
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,720
I left some stuff under the
lining of my phone book.

192
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,880
- Zanna, you're dead.
- We're dead.

193
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,720
Good, Colas... We've got
to get the phone book back.

194
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,075
Grab the cards,
let's see who has to do it.

195
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,438
Let's grab 'em...

196
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,120
- Queen.
- Seven of hearts.

197
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,559
Son of a bitch,
I'm supposed to meet Mirella!

198
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,080
Let things reach pure appearance,

199
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,959
let them deplete into
pure appearance,

200
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,755
let them sparkle.

201
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:37,520
Signs are deciphered,
appearances are not...

202
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,557
Signs aren't appearances
and appearances aren't signs.

203
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,800
You can decipher signs
as much as you fucking want,

204
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,028
but never appearances.

205
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,914
Got the student ID...

206
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,039
I've got everything.

207
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,108
But...

208
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,588
Fuck, the keys!

209
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,200
Well, Anna will be home
this afternoon anyway.

210
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,680
Let things reach pure appearance,

211
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,910
let them sparkle...

212
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,833
Fuck, the basin!

213
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,629
Well, it won't flood the house
too badly in half a day.

214
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,439
Signs are deciphered,
appearances are not.

215
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,029
No, not this!

216
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,199
Vincenzoni old and bony,
open up!

217
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,800
Vincenzoni Attilio, age 73.
Who are you?

218
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,960
Enrico Fiabeschi,
Anna's boyfriend. Move!

219
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,000
Where are you going?
This isn't the end, I'll tell Anna!

220
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,672
Careful, it's dangerous!

221
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,632
Alright!

222
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,160
I pester you?

223
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,800
Just tell me to go away
and you won't see me anymore!

224
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,000
- Go away.
- But you have to tell me.

225
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,480
I am telling you.

226
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,800
Yes, but now it doesn't count,

227
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,080
you were supposed to tell me
before!

228
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,911
She's telling you...

229
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,915
He's stuck.

230
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,071
Ternana - Ascoli game...

231
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,679
Luciano, I need to make a call.

232
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,231
Son, one shouldn't go outside
in pajamas!

233
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,434
Mariella, I don't have much
change, let me talk to mom.

234
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,320
Hello... Hi, Michele.

235
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,753
Can I talk to mom?

236
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,600
Hello, mom... Dad, it's you.

237
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,794
What?

238
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,672
Let me talk to mom,
I don't have much change!

239
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,758
Mariella, you again?

240
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,240
I don't know!

241
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,120
Let me talk to mom!

242
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,874
Mom, finally! I wanted...

243
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,518
Now I'm getting pissed off.

244
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:56,240
Signs are deciphered,
appearances are not...

245
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,597
Signs yes, appearances never.

246
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,360
We were different from you,

247
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,160
we protested to defend our ideas.

248
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,200
We wanted to get to know
each other...

249
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,720
Sex was carefree,
we'd go to someone's house...

250
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,597
Bullshit!

251
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,960
When you're young it's hard
to believe in a cruel destiny...

252
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,000
You know Mirella, right?

253
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,274
Class 2H.

254
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,320
...but then you realize
that destiny is assisted

255
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,680
by what we've assembled

256
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,920
and it is this that decides for us!

257
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,310
Go get her, and come to the club.
Colas will be there too.

258
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,310
Mirella alone with Zanna and Colas!

259
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,238
Don't want to think about it.

260
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,192
Uncertain weather, low visibility.

261
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,239
You're not coming?

262
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,356
None of my shit's clean,

263
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,548
I'm borrowing a shirt and stuff.

264
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,072
You know about today's meeting?

265
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,760
It seems the cops
found out about Luisa's deal.

266
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,877
But we won't let it happen.

267
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,950
Lucilla dumped me.

268
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,516
Lucilla dumped me.

269
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,834
You can handle that...

270
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,358
I'm taking your boots too.

271
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,392
Are you always...

272
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,399
...so stagnant?

273
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,878
What's my fucking problem?

274
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,756
Why does my life suck?

275
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,240
My uncle's right,

276
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,118
hash rots your brains.

277
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,308
Luisa,

278
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,148
Matteo,

279
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,196
Gianna, the cops,

280
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,514
Lucilla...

281
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,552
This white sky!

282
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,400
Don't ask me anything,
don't make me talk.

283
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,719
I wouldn't dare.

284
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,309
I love you,
I have so many things to tell you.

285
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,158
Your nose is dirty.

286
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,640
- I'm burnt out.
- Why, honey?

287
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,471
Life burns me out.

288
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,993
I feel clumsy.

289
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,240
- I feel alone.
- Come to mama.

290
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,674
Honey, be careful.

291
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:53,595
Bone up... Bone up...
Bone up...

292
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,352
Bone up, fuck!

293
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,435
Bone up.

294
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,630
Please, bone up!

295
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,551
Bone up, up!

296
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,390
Well, at this time of the day.

297
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,879
It's too easy...

298
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,880
When you don't know what to do

299
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,714
it's too easy to take refuge
in copulation.

300
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,600
If someone would think
from reading this crap

301
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,720
that I've got nothing left to say,

302
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,800
I'd say that in each board
there's enough material

303
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,360
to construct a few stories

304
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,670
that I won't narrate because
I have nothing left to tell you.

305
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,360
He's the best!

306
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,911
Better than the best,
practically a rock star!

307
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,360
What happened?

308
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,080
Will you ask me a few questions?

309
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:25,400
Youngsters do nothing,
yet they expect things to happen!

310
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,119
We were both here... What happened?

311
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,040
We know the "whys"
let's discover the "hows"!

312
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,920
Our comrade
from the research group

313
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,480
will give us a detailed
explanation of the situation.

314
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,720
Comrades, the only way
to get ourselves out of this shit

315
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,360
is to step up the fighting!

316
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,989
It's not just the group's
problem, but all of ours!

317
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,240
The initiative has to be ours!

318
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,160
Sit-in!

319
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,994
Sit-in!

320
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,760
11,000 uninhabited houses in Bologna
and thousands of homeless students.

321
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,560
Enough with these
scheming feminists.

322
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,596
Show your face!

323
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,960
Shut up for a second!

324
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,997
There was a problem
with the truth pamphlets.

325
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,830
Do we still have a propaganda group?

326
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,520
You think you're superior...

327
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,795
Coefficient bullshit at the max.

328
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,750
I said, bullshit at the max!

329
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,440
I can't work with all this ruckus.

330
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,880
This is my house too,
go somewhere else,

331
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,560
anywhere you want.

332
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,393
I don't oppose, but what the fuck!

333
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,196
You're an artist,
and you don't give a shit

334
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,155
but we give a shit about you.

335
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:34,800
You're an artist so you think
you're the shit.

336
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,760
You spend the night at school
and call it a sit-in,

337
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,560
you slap up two posters and
your conscience is at peace!

338
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,480
You read the "Espresso"
every other week

339
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,520
and "Linus" when you feel like it

340
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,760
and you think you're informed!

341
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,600
In practice buddy,

342
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:58,080
you either become productive
for the movement,

343
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,640
or go fuck yourself!

344
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,600
The Pentothal who doesn't
give a shit, you made him up!

345
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,240
It's a non existant myth!

346
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,800
It's not you who doesn't give a shit,

347
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,553
it's the others
who've emarginated you!

348
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,479
You think you're the shit
cuz you're an artist!

349
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,956
Of course I work...
at the consortium.

350
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,880
What do you mean, which?

351
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,713
You think you're the shit
cuz you're an artist!

352
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,437
At the drainage consortium.
In Latina.

353
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,480
What do I want?
I'm here for the exam.

354
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,034
Did I read anything? No.

355
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,840
I work, how can I?

356
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,120
As if I have time to read
Kripke and Chomsky...

357
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,120
Who'll take care of my kids, you?

358
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,960
Plus I don't know them...
What do you mean, what?

359
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,155
I don't know any of this shit.

360
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,351
Why do I want to take this exam?

361
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,800
All I need to graduate is "Modal
Philosophy" and "Model Theory",

362
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,552
and you think I'd just
give up like that?

363
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,796
This is "Semiotics"?

364
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,638
This is "DAMS"?

365
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,755
What's that?

366
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,400
Oh, this isn't Philosophy?

367
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,958
Now you tell me?

368
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,478
Next, Fiabeschi Enrico.

369
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,791
Hey there, that's me.

370
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,240
Good morning. Topic?

371
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,878
"Apocalypse Now".

372
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,999
Take off the sunglasses please.

373
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,880
Well I studied all night,
so my eyes are...

374
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,279
Take them off anyway.

375
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,036
Tell me about "Apocalypse Now".

376
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,640
"Apocalypse Now", is directed
by Francis Ford Coppola,

377
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,868
with music by the Doors.

378
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,673
The film starts off
with a burning forest,

379
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:50,280
choppers fly overhead
and underneath,

380
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,271
is music by the Doors.

381
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,600
A beautiful scene.

382
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,160
- How much did the film cost?
- A load of money!

383
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,640
They probably spent a million
dollars just on the helicopters,

384
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,120
then Storaro...

385
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,032
- Did you read about the film?
- Of course.

386
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,440
The main actor is Marlon Brando.

387
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,640
Marlon Brando is Kurtz,
the film's main character.

388
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,393
Kurtz is all like...

389
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,715
What's the name of the real
main actor?

390
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,273
The real main actor.

391
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,440
What's the name?

392
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,240
There are many actors in the film,

393
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,753
but Coppola...

394
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,760
...Marlon Brando
used as a pretext...

395
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,594
Marlon Brando is really...

396
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,200
...for Coppola it was a pretext...

397
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,952
...a pretext for...

398
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,511
Maybe I should ask you
something else.

399
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,440
The film depicts a battle,
what kind?

400
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,520
A battle between man and nature.

401
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,910
- And then?
- And then, what?

402
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,000
There's the battle against
the productive system,

403
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,360
against repression
of the imaginary,

404
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,000
Vietnam,
the process of Vietnamesization,

405
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,320
individual and collective.

406
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:20,680
Exactly, individual and collective,
battle between man and nature...

407
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,840
That's what I said before,
but if you want to be picky...

408
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,320
That was the answer.

409
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:31,156
- Let's talk about Conrad.
- Who?

410
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,720
"Heart of Darkness."

411
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,680
What does the river symbolize
for Conrad-Coppola?

412
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,955
Oh, "Cornad" Coppola...

413
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,988
The river symbolizes...

414
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,200
- The journey.
- Exactly that!

415
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,000
The journey of this river

416
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,200
which descends into the valley

417
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,520
and gets covered up by branches...

418
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,080
The journey of the snake!

419
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,800
"A mighty big river which resembled
an immense snake

420
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,280
with its head in the sea
and its body at rest

421
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,200
curving afar over a vast country

422
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,794
and its tail lost in the depths
of the land.

423
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,600
It fascinated me

424
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,990
as a snake would a bird."

425
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,278
Enough with this farce.

426
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,600
I wasn't able to study,

427
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:46,036
just let me pass, or else
I'll have to join the army.

428
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,869
- Why not?
- Because you didn't study.

429
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,280
You're punishing me
with a year of army life

430
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,880
cuz I don't know "Apocalypse Now",
I couldn't give a shit about it!

431
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,000
I mean, I wasn't able to...

432
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,480
I flunked six people today

433
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,360
who had actually tried
more than you.

434
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,240
But this isn't
a meritocratic society!

435
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,840
Everyone becomes someone
thanks to someone else,

436
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,520
I'm the only one
who has to follow the rules!

437
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:16,560
- Listen, the proletarian...
- You're a bitch!

438
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:20,680
This is a dumb-ass exam
and you're a fucking Fascist!

439
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,560
Thirsty for power like Hitler!

440
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:25,791
You didn't even ask me the difference
between sign and appearance!

441
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:31,440
You asked about the snake!
Know where you can stick it?

442
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,510
Up your dirty Fascist ass!

443
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,520
Out.

444
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,511
Go get your pussy proletarianized!

445
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,320
- And close the door when you leave!
- Fuck you!

446
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,912
Fuck you!

447
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:13,040
I think of my sister,
brother, mother,

448
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,830
father, grandfather
who is no longer around...

449
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,113
Moon,

450
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,713
you're so beautiful,

451
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,758
I look at you and get
knots in my stomach...

452
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,520
What a shitty day!

453
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,080
I think about how at my house

454
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,435
we'd laugh...

455
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,192
- It's them.
- Zanardi's wearing the scarf?

456
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,233
Yes, the other one's Colas.

457
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:21,120
Zanardi is just like I imagined him.
But now I'm sort of...

458
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,200
You should hear the stories
they tell about them.

459
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,839
Don't tell me, or I'll get scared.

460
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,989
- Relax, come on.
- Alright.

461
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,395
Hi, I'm Mirella.

462
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,959
I've heard wonders about you.

463
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,120
Just think, you'll see me naked soon.

464
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,997
The power's out.

465
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,753
Do you like music?

466
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,838
I'll turn the heater on.

467
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,400
Well?

468
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,595
The Mirella I met in the gym,

469
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,959
who I picked up.

470
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,480
I'll carry your bag.

471
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,119
Who I kept making dates with...

472
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,920
Who I told all about me...

473
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,275
Today I did 60 push ups
and 40 sit ups!

474
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:36,320
I do it for internal evolution,

475
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,600
for spiritual growth.

476
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,400
...I may be noble, but who cares.

477
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:43,678
Combining these two worlds,
nobility and gym, is difficult...

478
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,120
You find yourself at a reception
with a tie and salad fork...

479
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,800
What do you mean nobility?

480
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,518
My grandmother was a princess!

481
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,714
Do you take the 13?

482
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,480
We should hang out.

483
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,320
We can go out with friends
if you want.

484
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,278
It's cool, whenever you want.

485
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:19,030
The onl y thing left of her is the
memory of all the lies I told.

486
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,597
Not a kiss,
not a "Billo" caress...

487
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,440
- We're getting bored without you.
- Come on out!

488
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,040
Being shy?

489
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:36,591
Out! Out!

490
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,275
Awesome!

491
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,273
You're so beautiful Colas,
how do you do it?

492
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,955
The gym.

493
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,037
Here's the other.

494
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,760
Guy's dicks are all the same,
don't you think?

495
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,718
That's like saying
all pussies are the same.

496
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,157
Come here.

497
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,280
Mirella,

498
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,475
do they look alike?

499
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,272
No, actually.

500
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:46,560
- Colas' is longer.
- When it's limp.

501
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,073
Get the ruler.

502
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,512
What's the point of going on?

503
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,516
I think I can jet now.

504
00:56:58,760 --> 00:56:59,875
Fuck!

505
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,833
Hear that shout?

506
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,360
I know only one set of tonsils
capable of that,

507
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:02,672
Gino Nardella's,
man of culture and beggar!

508
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,840
I've practiced waiting in line
for years,

509
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,600
now I let out a shout every
15 minutes, automatically,

510
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,352
I'm as precise as a stop watch.

511
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:36,200
Every day I spend three hours in line

512
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,997
and I still don't know anyone,

513
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,117
the head of the guy in front of me
and the breath of the one in back.

514
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,512
Deranged lunatics!

515
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:56,315
Fuck, it's 2:15!

516
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,435
Here, the Greek table,

517
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,798
the Calabrian kids...

518
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,676
Guys from Messina, Enna,

519
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,078
Sardinian feminists,

520
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,751
the gay posse from Pescara.

521
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,510
Alone. I'm alone.

522
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,592
This is not possible!

523
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,600
What?

524
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:38,600
This is the sickest soup
I have ever tasted, try it.

525
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,560
I believe you.

526
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:43,200
It made my mouth all shitty.

527
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,040
- I said I believe you.
- You have to taste it.

528
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,280
I believe you!

529
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,040
- You have to taste it.
- Tell them!

530
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,000
I've never tasted anything
so gross!

531
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,558
- I understand.
- Taste!

532
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,119
- Taste!
- Fuck off!

533
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:06,000
Panic transversalism,
schizophrenic nomadism

534
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
dictatorship of meaning,

535
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,160
proletariat in precarization,

536
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,440
time freed from work,

537
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,680
subtractive proletarian transience,

538
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:19,760
generalized social misappropriation,

539
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:24,515
non violent demonstration
defended by small weapons,

540
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:28,760
hysteric creativity, Mao-Dadaism,

541
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,160
ironic sensual poetics,

542
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:36,240
deterritorialization,
reterritorialization,

543
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:41,160
hysteric subjectivism,
generalized femininization,

544
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:45,680
creative subversion,
repression of subject.

545
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:50,708
Happiness is subversive
when its collectivized.

546
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,189
Permanent marker, erasers,

547
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:31,111
exacto, stapler,

548
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,508
scissors,

549
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:37,240
butts, filters, paste, glue stick,

550
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:40,516
scraps, pencils, pastels,

551
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,395
color chart, brushes,

552
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:48,720
ink, rapidograph, chalk,

553
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,917
plates, glasses, ash tray, lighter,

554
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:56,600
masks, pencil shavings,

555
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,880
crumbs, glasses,

556
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,429
rulers, squares, compass...

557
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,032
...and Lucilla's purse.

558
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,634
Why did she leave it here?

559
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,953
I love you.

560
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:54,356
First kiss.

561
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,917
I don't care about the mechanics.

562
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,878
Now you say I'm weak, but
you didn't think so on Thursday.

563
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,433
I ask myself what I'm looking for.

564
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,834
What am I looking for?

565
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,393
I ask myself what do you want.

566
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,319
What do I want?

567
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,997
Why did Lucilla
leave her purse here?

568
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:25,232
I don't care
about the mechanics...

569
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,472
Do I care about the mechanics?

570
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,037
No, I don't care
about the mechanics.

571
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,440
Should I put it on automatic pilot?

572
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,557
No, so long as it goes.

573
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:50,829
Go!

574
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,633
We've got a flat, pass me the joint.

575
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,238
This really is a desert.

576
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:31,516
But I'm a multitude,
so be thankful I'm here.

577
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,920
It's like a morgue.

578
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,593
All flat...

579
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,268
We've been going around for 3 months
and haven't run into anyone.

580
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,951
There's nothing, not even basil...

581
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:50,720
After this last pleasant observation,

582
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,233
want to go?

583
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:17,519
Lucilla, I finally found you!

584
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,079
It is you, right?

585
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,758
Good, I'm happy.

586
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,548
You're beautiful,

587
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,913
you always were.

588
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:30,920
I love you.

589
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:33,388
Now that I found you again,
I won't leave you!

590
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,991
You'll never leave, right?

591
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:40,992
We'll always be together and I won't
have those horrible dreams anymore.

592
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:04,875
Open up!

593
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,393
Why did you lock yourselves in?

594
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,153
What the fuck are you doing?

595
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,350
You took forever!

596
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,880
No phone book.

597
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,313
Did you look really well?

598
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,792
I'm starving now!

599
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,711
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

600
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,638
- Mirella, wanna come to the cafe?
- Yes.

601
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,791
What a loser!

602
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,954
Here.

603
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,240
I didn't know you knew
Zanardi and Colasanti.

604
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:01,800
I knew of them, Elena let me get
better acquainted with them today.

605
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,028
That bitch!

606
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:07,069
- You went to the club?
- Yes, but they were waiting for you.

607
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:10,831
I bet you had fun.

608
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,113
Somewhat...

609
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,080
- What's that face about?
- I know why!

610
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,520
What did you do?

611
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:23,880
I could say mind your own
business, but I'll answer you.

612
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,189
We got naked and touched each other.

613
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,560
Zanardi... God, I hate you!

614
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:35,080
"Bea Guidicini, Blake's Hotel,

615
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:38,197
18 Hampton Road, W1 London."

616
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:45,197
Bea, think of me now...

617
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:50,155
Wherever you are, turn around.

618
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:55,551
Turn around now,
it's me, your Z anna.

619
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:03,432
That'll do, end of broadcast.

620
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,793
I haven't read your letter yet, so
I don't know that you've dumped me.

621
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,033
Hey, do you have a joint?

622
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,674
Do you have a joint?

623
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:21,032
Do you have a joint?

624
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,795
Is anybody here?

625
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,269
Is there anyone here?

626
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:14,630
I am, I'm chewing
and meditating in the dark.

627
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:39,069
Do you have a joint?

628
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,753
Chew, chew...

629
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,396
I've been wandering for 3 hours,

630
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,196
do you have a joint?

631
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:57,271
No, but it's warm down here
and I'm soft and clean.

632
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,038
I'll smoke later.

633
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:11,511
FORBIDDEN TO FORBID

634
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:48,191
TOMORROW SOCIALISM BEGINS
BE PUNCTUAL

635
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,589
THE NEW '68 WILL BE CALIBER 38

636
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,600
As the sky changes hues...

637
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,400
Changes hues my foot!

638
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:18,200
- Sirio appears under the moon...
- The moon...

639
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:21,431
The whole city sets itself
for the long night.

640
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:26,710
Noise is captured
in the thick clouds of smog...

641
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,916
...a rug of bright embers...

642
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:35,152
Lovely, is it yours?

643
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,960
- No, it's my friend Pompeo's.
- You still hang out with him?

644
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:44,160
- What am I doing here?
- You already said that.

645
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,440
- Get with it.
- Leave me alone!

646
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:50,956
Get with it, people will get bored
and tired!

647
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:29,110
Love me!

648
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:42,156
Love me!

649
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,509
The exam?

650
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,920
- It went badly?
- She's a bitch!

651
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:04,392
Honey, no one understands you.

652
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,880
Want to hang out tonight?

653
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,189
No, I'm going out with Diana.

654
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,320
Are you always with her?

655
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,436
She always stares.

656
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,438
- I feel lonely.
- But I'll be home early.

657
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,640
Wait for me at home.

658
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,471
Come on...

659
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,840
When will you be back?

660
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,600
She said early!

661
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,880
What the fuck do you want?

662
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:38,080
- Leave her alone.
- She's always eavesdropping!

663
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:41,436
Take the car keys,

664
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:44,037
go home and wait for me.

665
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:51,789
Sorry.

666
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:54,589
She's always there...

667
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:58,400
- Can you lend me five bills?
- Again?

668
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,516
- I need it.
- For what?

669
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,718
To buy you some flowers.

670
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,751
Some flowers...

671
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,348
Here.

672
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:16,240
Diana, why don't you do this
once in a while?

673
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,151
At least your hair will be...

674
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,638
Up yours!

675
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,280
You're higher than a kite...

676
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:39,508
Wanna get high?

677
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:45,951
Okay guys, no problem!

678
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,080
To the train station I went,

679
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:13,400
for eptadone to get spent,

680
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:16,517
took off in the van I was lent!

681
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:24,320
The housewives get in line
to hear me crank and rhyme

682
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:28,757
and they have a hell of a time!

683
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:55,558
Look at all the people!
Massimo's even there.

684
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,194
Wonder what he's up to?

685
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,398
I can stop to see a friend, right?

686
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:05,280
Massimo a.k.a. Mighty Max,

687
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:08,960
resident of Bologna,
do you have a joint?

688
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,520
I'm waiting for Mezzasega,
he's bringing some herb.

689
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:16,800
Seeing that it's not too late,
it's my duty to stay and wait.

690
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,520
- Go park.
- Where?

691
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:24,120
- Pull the brake and leave it here.
- It's Anna's car.

692
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:27,396
- Whose?
- Never mind. I'll park there.

693
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,440
Do you have the weed?

694
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:34,000
- It's him.
- Yes.

695
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,320
The one with the mustache
and long hair.

696
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:38,960
Cute!

697
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:42,280
I got it, but let's go smoke
somewhere else.

698
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:45,317
- Where?
- At one of their houses.

699
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:50,960
Chicks?

700
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:54,430
So long as it's a joint
with friends, it's cool,

701
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:58,240
but you never know what
to expect with chicks...

702
01:17:58,240 --> 01:17:59,840
I'm out of here.

703
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,840
What, you're leaving?

704
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:05,840
We need your car
plus this is some killer weed.

705
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:08,513
Enrico, you don't know
what you're missing.

706
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:40,876
I live on the edge,
I'm touched by the slums,

707
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,432
I chat with wanted criminals,

708
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:44,994
I'm in full swing,

709
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,392
I earn and burn millions.

710
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,869
I take risks, I waste away,

711
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,512
I humiliate myself, then I give up...

712
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,434
I give up.

713
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:08,232
Then I get high and it's all
perfect, better than before.

714
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:13,073
The alternative is a pub, a job,

715
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:17,599
savings, the regular
crumbling of the body,

716
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,800
the nice guy, the annoying girl,
the natural dork,

717
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,870
two times two is four,
wake up at eight!

718
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,752
That's even more of
a pain in the ass!

719
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:33,678
Nothing like resurrection,
resurrection...

720
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,157
I'm glad you called me.

721
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,917
Really glad!

722
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:15,400
I'm glad you called,
so unexpectedly...

723
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:18,039
- Don't turn on the lights.
- Right, it's better.

724
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,069
Get naked.

725
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:22,710
Huh?

726
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:43,278
What's wrong with smoking up
with some chicks?

727
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:47,071
They exist, I can't hide from them.

728
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,995
It could happen
that we smoke up together.

729
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,320
"On the peak

730
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,040
of the ancient tower,

731
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:04,112
solitary thrush..."

732
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:10,720
Nice Infante, that's the way
I like you. It came out well.

733
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:12,880
I wonder if it'll get blurry
if we make a poster of it?

734
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:16,793
As your brain may have realized,
in exchange for this

735
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:19,352
you have to do us a favor.

736
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,634
Wanna come with me to Mexico?

737
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:27,600
Would you want to?

738
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:32,913
I wouldn't even go
around the corner with you.

739
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:39,311
You're the famous Fiabeschi...

740
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,798
- I've heard about you.
- It's me.

741
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,080
- What's your name?
- Marilisa.

742
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:48,240
Pretty name!

743
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:51,312
How would you feel about
going over there?

744
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,000
We can lie down, kiss a bit,

745
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,320
have sex, but just for fun.

746
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:00,680
Okay, but let's use my
parents' bed cuz it's bigger.

747
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:03,399
Of course, your parents' bed...

748
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:05,473
...cuz it's bigger.

749
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:12,320
If it's not in the office she
must have brought it home.

750
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:16,480
It's not hard to get in, enter
the bedroom from the back yard,

751
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,799
she won't be home.

752
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:22,440
Look in the drawers and search
through her purse if you see it,

753
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:23,714
but don't make a mess.

754
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,472
Remember, she's
going to her sister's

755
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:33,240
so take your time
and find the phone book.

756
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,200
You have plenty of time.

757
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:39,591
We're going to a club
so we can have a solid alibi.

758
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,670
Colas, you're the best.

759
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:49,437
Yes, the best...

760
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:02,989
Who were you with?

761
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:08,114
Menozzi. Says he
wants to marry me.

762
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:14,077
Now, let's get noticed.

763
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:18,911
What the fuck should I do?

764
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,957
He's tall, you're not,
not your fault.

765
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:27,116
His hair is like silk, yours isn't,
can't help it.

766
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,758
He has curls, you don't,
not a big deal.

767
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:35,519
He's thin and you're plump,
it happens.

768
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:40,069
He dances well and
you don't, at all.

769
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:43,990
He's rich and you're not,
he's cool and you're not,

770
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:45,710
he's...

771
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:49,956
He's fucking your girl on
the couch and you're not.

772
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:53,120
He's him and you're not.

773
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,160
So?

774
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:55,991
Go outside and torch his car.

775
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,111
Ma'am, it's me!

776
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,030
Let me explain.

777
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,469
It's me.

778
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:07,520
Don't call the police!

779
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:10,592
Please have pity!

780
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:12,749
Pity!

781
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:17,392
Let go of my hand!

782
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:19,878
My mother will die!

783
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:32,351
I'm the valedictorian
of the class.

784
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:35,676
The valedictorian!

785
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,112
The valedictorian!

786
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,392
Fuck, the keys!

787
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,033
Gross!

788
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,797
Wake up!

789
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:28,553
Wake up, the keys!

790
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,240
The car keys!

791
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,913
- Danny took them.
- Who?

792
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:37,680
Who the fuck is Danny?

793
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:41,160
- The girl I was talking to.
- Where'd she go?

794
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:43,840
Home, or her parents
would've killed her.

795
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,796
Where does she live?

796
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,640
No!

797
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:53,080
She's not even 18, no driver's
license... Son of a bitch!

798
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:55,640
You have to go, my parents
are on their way home.

799
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,160
Listen... What's your
fucking name?

800
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:02,440
Bitch, it's 2:00

801
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:05,480
and that fucking ugly-ass
friend of yours

802
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:07,072
took my car.

803
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,040
Now you tell me where she lives

804
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:13,952
and if she has
a fucking phone number!

805
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,393
Calm down,

806
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,876
at this rate you'll die before 40.

807
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,040
I know her.

808
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:27,320
- Where does she fucking live?
- Near my house, I'll bring you.

809
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:29,595
- How'll we get there?
- We'll walk.

810
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:35,198
- It's on the other side of town!
- We'll take a little stroll.

811
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,959
He really did it!

812
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,472
What a bitch!

813
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:43,640
She even left you the keys,
what more do you want?

814
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:44,800
And if it had been stolen?

815
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,234
I'm going.

816
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:53,190
Well, I'll go with you.

817
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:58,352
We'll smoke one more joint,
just for the hell of it.

818
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:01,196
You've got another joint?

819
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:03,559
A crappy one.

820
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:09,313
She's gonna kick me out this time,
I can feel it.

821
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:11,713
It's over.

822
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:58,029
Poor woman!

823
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,640
Was she strangled?
Probably by a manic.

824
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:03,596
No one is safe anymore,
not even here.

825
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:07,152
Not bad, Infante!

826
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:23,871
Dear Zanardi,

827
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:27,757
rules exist that forbid us
from believing in miracles.

828
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:32,640
It's crazy to believe that you
can suddenly become cultured

829
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:34,640
if you've never read a book,

830
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:38,872
or become respected if you've
always behaved unjustly.

831
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:43,120
These are miracles
that can't happen.

832
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:45,880
Just like the outcome of
yellow and blue is green,

833
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:48,314
not pink or brown.

834
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:52,431
Green is mathematical.

835
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:55,793
Remember it.

836
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:05,994
We should celebrate,

837
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,112
let's go get fucked up.

838
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:10,200
Wanna get high?

839
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,120
Where will we get the stuff?

840
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:16,079
You thought I was stupid enough
to leave it in the phone book?

841
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:22,040
Enough paranoia!

842
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:25,200
If she dumps me, it's the end,

843
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,640
no more car or house.

844
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:30,120
All I'll have is this jacket,
these pants

845
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:32,634
and I'll be a bum in the streets.

846
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:37,718
Fuck, be careful!
Why did I have to run into you?

847
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:42,720
Damn me and the moment
I ran into you!

848
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:44,358
Damn it!

849
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:54,310
Are you going to pass me
the fucking joint?

850
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:00,000
Yes or no?

851
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,150
I only took one hit.

852
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,240
Pass it to me!

853
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:19,117
Wait!

854
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:18,913
You gonna kill it or I will?

855
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,033
I will.

856
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:21,913
NEVER GO BACK NOT EVEN
TO GET A RUNNING START

857
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:37,554
It's four.

858
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:43,269
Ringo's sleeping,
Gianna's sleeping,

859
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:45,513
so is Matteo,

860
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:48,070
I'm not.

861
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:51,198
Totally stoned,

862
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:54,556
but alert as a killer.

863
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:00,511
I'm not relaxed at all.

864
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:06,592
Actually, all the opposite, I'm
like a hundred meter sprinter.

865
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:11,912
I have to relax.

866
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:16,596
I'll get up and make myself
a triple dose of chamomile.

867
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:20,114
I'll get up now.

868
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:22,872
I'll get up on three...

869
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:28,719
I'll get up now.

870
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:33,719
What if I smoke a joint instead?

871
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:38,077
Smoke a joint and jerk off,
that way I'll get up.

872
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:42,592
Okay, I won't get up anymore.

873
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,396
I need to stay lying down,

874
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:48,438
and live this deadlock.
