2
00:01:00,158 --> 00:01:03,526
And now, the last finalist,

3
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:09,059
three-time champion
Charlyne Phuc.

4
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:16,573
Excuse me.

5
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,310
Ah!

6
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:23,148
First word: Logorrhea.

7
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:29,716
Logorrhea, um...

8
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,992
L- o-g-o-r-r...

9
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:37,196
w- wait...

10
00:01:39,706 --> 00:01:41,197
Logorrhea...

11
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:44,803
like diarrhea, but different.

12
00:01:44,845 --> 00:01:49,715
I mean, they're both
kind of like a spray,

13
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:53,119
but logorrhea,
that's a spray of words

14
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:54,681
from the mouth, you know?

15
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:58,422
And, like, diarrhea,
which is also a spray,

16
00:01:58,462 --> 00:02:02,297
but it comes
from a different orifice.

17
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,427
What in the world?

18
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,664
Ugh.

19
00:02:09,943 --> 00:02:12,537
Fuck, am I, like, way off?

20
00:02:14,015 --> 00:02:15,642
There is breaking news tonight

21
00:02:15,683 --> 00:02:17,810
from the State Spelling Bee
Championship

22
00:02:17,852 --> 00:02:20,287
as Morgan High's own
Charlyne Phuc has been arrested

23
00:02:20,322 --> 00:02:21,653
for drug possession.

24
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,522
Phuc has admitted
using marijuana

25
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,120
during her three-time
championship run

26
00:02:26,162 --> 00:02:29,064
in order to assist her mortal mind

27
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,260
in accessing
the dictionary inscribed

28
00:02:31,302 --> 00:02:33,237
in the fabric of the cosmos...

29
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:35,205
And that no one would have noticed

30
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,233
if she hadrt been so buttstonked.

31
00:02:40,913 --> 00:02:43,906
Shh.

32
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:48,082
Shut up, Dave.

33
00:02:48,122 --> 00:02:49,987
Sh... shut up, Dave.

34
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:57,797
# The wind blows cool
across my face... #

35
00:02:57,834 --> 00:02:59,665
Dave, take my weed.

36
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,334
# I can smell the taste,
a trace of lace #

37
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:09,643
# There's something
sinister in place... #

38
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:13,379
- Hold his feet.
- I am, Dave.

39
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:15,911
- Dave, roll that shit.
- I am, Dave.

40
00:03:17,524 --> 00:03:20,517
- Holy...
- Fuck.

41
00:03:20,562 --> 00:03:22,962
Hey, Mom? I got some
MIT scholarship stuff that I filled out.

42
00:03:22,998 --> 00:03:24,488
If you could drop it in the mail,
I'd appreciate it.

43
00:03:24,532 --> 00:03:26,592
Honey,
I clogged the toilet again.

44
00:03:26,636 --> 00:03:28,661
The plunger should be
under the sink.

45
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:29,899
- Where?
- The back.

46
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,966
- Oh, I... I got it.
- All right, thanks.

47
00:03:34,812 --> 00:03:37,508
- I love you.
- # My mind slips further #

48
00:03:37,548 --> 00:03:39,073
# From what's real #

49
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,550
# Take my hands away
from the steering wheel... #

50
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:51,125
# I'm crashing,
coming down in waves #

51
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:54,829
# And wipe the sweat
from upon my face #

52
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,831
# And it's a perfect day
to leave this place... #

53
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:03,175
- Ooh.
- # It's a perfect day #

54
00:04:03,213 --> 00:04:05,647
# To hide down
in my own home... #

55
00:04:05,683 --> 00:04:07,173
What the fuck?!

56
00:04:07,217 --> 00:04:09,709
Watch where
the fuck you step, Henry!

57
00:04:09,754 --> 00:04:12,087
Watch where the fuck you step!

58
00:04:15,227 --> 00:04:17,662
# It's a perfect day #

59
00:04:17,698 --> 00:04:19,632
# To waste away... #

60
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,602
# Your perfect part to play... #

61
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:27,598
# Just another perfect day,
but before you know, it's gone... #

62
00:04:29,745 --> 00:04:32,647
# It's a perfect day to waste away #

63
00:04:32,682 --> 00:04:35,344
- # Your perfect part to play... #
- Shit.

64
00:04:35,385 --> 00:04:40,757
# Just another perfect day,
but before you know, it's gone. #

65
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:50,096
Oh!

66
00:04:52,573 --> 00:04:54,097
Bravo, fuckers.

67
00:04:54,141 --> 00:04:55,734
"I swallow."

68
00:04:57,512 --> 00:04:59,412
Shut up.

69
00:04:59,447 --> 00:05:02,315
D- Dad. No...

70
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:04,411
- It won't happen again. I promise.
- I expect you to pay

71
00:05:04,454 --> 00:05:06,786
every last penny
of my deductible.

72
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:10,089
In the meantime, you can spend
this afternoon in detention.

73
00:05:10,128 --> 00:05:11,959
Yes, sir.

74
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:16,767
- Come along, Martin.
- Yes, Daddy.

75
00:05:22,442 --> 00:05:23,967
Hey.

76
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:26,707
Hey, Breaux.
I hit Dr. Gordon because of you.

77
00:05:27,715 --> 00:05:29,445
I shouldn't have to pay
for his car, man.

78
00:05:29,484 --> 00:05:30,974
All right, well, tough shit.
I mean, you're the one who crashed

79
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:32,817
- into that butthole Gordon.
- To avoid hitting you!

80
00:05:32,855 --> 00:05:34,914
News flash: Wearing headphones
while driving is against the law.

81
00:05:34,957 --> 00:05:38,325
You know, I don't think I should take
behavior advice from a burner flunky.

82
00:05:38,362 --> 00:05:40,262
- Ouch, dude!
- Yeah, well, why don't you take

83
00:05:40,297 --> 00:05:42,163
your science-fair,
national-scholar status

84
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,599
and cram it up your asshole?

85
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,398
You know, Breaux...

86
00:05:45,437 --> 00:05:47,668
Yeah, thank you.

87
00:05:48,707 --> 00:05:50,504
Way to be a hambro.

88
00:05:50,543 --> 00:05:53,445
It wasrt like I made him crash into
that man-whore's piece-of-shit car.

89
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,107
That's what that scrotum

90
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:56,878
skin tag Gordon gets
for teaching his fat little clone

91
00:05:56,918 --> 00:05:58,249
how to give a hand job.

92
00:05:58,286 --> 00:06:00,720
Rollir on 12s, son.

93
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:05,550
Aw, come on.

94
00:06:05,594 --> 00:06:07,859
He's behind you!

95
00:06:07,897 --> 00:06:10,799
What?

96
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:12,403
What?

97
00:06:13,871 --> 00:06:15,464
You know what
the problem is here, Brandon?

98
00:06:15,507 --> 00:06:18,499
Why our average GPA has dropped

99
00:06:18,543 --> 00:06:20,842
three times in as many years?

100
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,508
Uh, the Internet?

101
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,144
The sticky green.

102
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:28,882
The cannabis sativa.
The sinsemilla.

103
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,914
Marijuana?

104
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:36,591
Which is serious stuff.

105
00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:39,158
Dangerous stuff, so I hear.
It's a gateway drug.

106
00:06:39,202 --> 00:06:42,069
Hop-heads like Travis Breaux
have been a thorn on my side

107
00:06:42,105 --> 00:06:44,165
ever since they came here.

108
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,405
That little prick has caused me
more pain than you know.

109
00:06:48,914 --> 00:06:52,543
- My cat...
- Yeah?

110
00:06:53,586 --> 00:06:55,952
...developed an abscess on her face.

111
00:06:55,989 --> 00:06:58,288
I rushed her to the vet
emergency room,

112
00:06:58,325 --> 00:07:02,056
but their nitrous oxide tank
had been stolen.

113
00:07:02,096 --> 00:07:04,793
They later tracked the culprits down

114
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:09,362
to the home of one Travis Breaux.

115
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:12,603
Without anesthesia,
I had to pin Dolly down.

116
00:07:12,643 --> 00:07:15,373
She scratched my face, my hand.

117
00:07:15,412 --> 00:07:17,506
I developed a terrible infection.

118
00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:19,483
It's called "cat scratch fever."

119
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:21,075
My stool became

120
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,610
incredibly painful to pass.

121
00:07:22,655 --> 00:07:24,646
I lost weight, but gained body fat.

122
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,282
I was a mess.

123
00:07:26,325 --> 00:07:30,922
Then I heard my wife telling
her friends that I looked lousy.

124
00:07:36,071 --> 00:07:39,507
My attorney advised me against
taking any sort of action.

125
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:43,444
No evidence to press charges
against Travis Breaux,

126
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:47,439
but I knew... I knew
he was responsible,

127
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:50,477
breathing in that laughing gas filth.

128
00:07:52,257 --> 00:07:55,523
They call it "space surfing."

129
00:07:57,396 --> 00:08:00,594
Where do they come up
with all these clever names

130
00:08:00,634 --> 00:08:02,727
for recreational drug use?

131
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:08,536
Roasting a bone,
candy flipping,

132
00:08:08,576 --> 00:08:10,738
banging down a stiff loosey.

133
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:13,509
A stiff loosey...

134
00:08:14,651 --> 00:08:17,313
I haven't heard that one.

135
00:08:17,354 --> 00:08:21,052
When a woman from
a sordid underworld social circle

136
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:24,893
inales powdered cocaine
off of some loser's erect penis

137
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,560
and then doses acid
off of his testicles...

138
00:08:30,737 --> 00:08:32,933
I think it has something
to do with the Beatles.

139
00:08:35,643 --> 00:08:38,704
Now, they ruined our nation...

140
00:08:38,747 --> 00:08:41,011
drugs, fornicating,

141
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:44,315
a grown man singing
about his feelings.

142
00:08:44,353 --> 00:08:47,050
It's time we win this war,

143
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,888
expunge this school
of all dope fiends.

144
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,769
Henry: So I've created
a hybrid compound

145
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,036
with a resistance two times that
of regular silicon.

146
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,043
Used as the basis material
for electronics,

147
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,567
it would provide
increased protection

148
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:07,877
against power surges,
magnetic waves.

149
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:10,008
This is an electromagnetic
pulse generator.

150
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:12,612
Actually, could everyone
take a step back?

151
00:09:13,789 --> 00:09:17,317
It's a localized pulse, but it will fry
your laptops, your hard drives.

152
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,195
It'll kill your cell phones
if you're too close.

153
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:27,498
Tick, tick, tick.

154
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:32,776
So as you can see,
the motherboard

155
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:36,010
manufactured by my compound
is the undamaged one.

156
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:05,174
Shit.

157
00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:08,714
Bitter aftertaste of reality?

158
00:10:09,757 --> 00:10:12,591
You come to see
how the other half lives?

159
00:10:16,164 --> 00:10:19,532
- Boy: Mr. Thompson here?
- He went lookir for you.

160
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:24,567
Hey, fool, that's my shirt
you got on.

161
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:26,804
I gave it to Goodwill last year.

162
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,316
Fuckir hobo.

163
00:10:33,352 --> 00:10:34,842
Don't trip, Rubin.

164
00:10:34,887 --> 00:10:37,482
I'm sure he washed
your dad's cum off of it.

165
00:10:37,524 --> 00:10:39,355
What the fuck you just say to me?

166
00:10:39,392 --> 00:10:41,987
I said I'm sure he washed
your dad's cum off of it.

167
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:45,557
Or did some dry up in your ears?
You should clean them fuckers out.

168
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,124
Try an ear candle, yo.

169
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:51,698
Rubin?
Why aren't you in your seat?

170
00:10:51,741 --> 00:10:54,539
You know, we could have
a little Abu Ghraib action here,

171
00:10:54,577 --> 00:10:57,103
or we could watch our video.

172
00:10:57,147 --> 00:10:58,910
It's your call.

173
00:11:02,754 --> 00:11:05,121
I'm just gonna go ahead
and sit down.

174
00:11:05,157 --> 00:11:07,352
Good choice.

175
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,465
It's all ready. Just hit play.

176
00:11:16,904 --> 00:11:19,999
Everybody, pay attention.

177
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:21,600
And no talking.

178
00:11:21,643 --> 00:11:24,135
Narrator on TV: With his parents
out of town for the weekend,

179
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,277
Bob bends to the pressure
of his peers to be somebody

180
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:30,412
and smokes a joint.

181
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:33,390
That's street talk
for a marijuana cigarette.

182
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:36,519
Bob lights up and takes a drag.

183
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:40,396
What he doesn't realize is that
this seemingly harmless act

184
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,597
will bring the walls
of his reality crashing down.

185
00:11:55,985 --> 00:11:59,080
Narrator: Is this your idea
of getting jiggy with it?

186
00:12:06,732 --> 00:12:10,532
Narrator:
Applesauce 10 times a day.

187
00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:11,696
Man on TV:
How are you feeling?

188
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:14,332
- Boy: This video eats my balls.
- Boy #2: Word.

189
00:12:14,374 --> 00:12:17,469
Woman on TV: Dr. Gibson,
you're wanted in lobotomy room 7.

190
00:12:17,511 --> 00:12:20,572
Dr. Gibson to lobotomy room 7.

191
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,752
Narrator:
It will also help fund terrorism.

192
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,887
I only really want to blow things up
when I'm high.

193
00:12:35,266 --> 00:12:37,598
Think about it.

194
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,167
Man over radio:
Engage. Smoke 'em.

195
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:50,444
Henry.
Henry, hey, hey.

196
00:12:50,484 --> 00:12:53,078
Look, I'm sorry.
I drive like shit when I'm high.

197
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,089
You were high at 8:00
in the morning?

198
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:56,988
Yeah, of course.
I'll help you pay for it, all right?

199
00:12:57,025 --> 00:12:58,516
I'll float you some casheesh.

200
00:12:58,561 --> 00:13:01,894
Well, thanks, man.

201
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:05,800
I'm sorry about
the whole burner, flunky thing.

202
00:13:05,836 --> 00:13:06,860
Oh, no.
It's all good, you know.

203
00:13:06,904 --> 00:13:09,032
- I get worse from my dad, so...
- Right.

204
00:13:09,074 --> 00:13:11,634
- Yeah.
- How's he doir?

205
00:13:12,845 --> 00:13:13,937
Who's he doir?

206
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,175
He's probably balls deep
in some Jell-O mold as we speak.

207
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:19,947
Right.
So, um, this is me.

208
00:13:19,987 --> 00:13:21,579
Obviously.

209
00:13:23,825 --> 00:13:25,759
Hey, you remember
how I caught you jerking off

210
00:13:25,793 --> 00:13:27,591
with BENGAY
when you were, like, 12?

211
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:30,029
- Yeah.
- Aw, yo, that shit must have burned!

212
00:13:30,065 --> 00:13:31,363
- Yeah, that's funny.
- I told everybody, and you ran off

213
00:13:31,401 --> 00:13:33,164
in the woods like some
fuckir cracked-out Hobbit.

214
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:35,103
- Yeah, no, no. I remember.
- Yo, there were helicopters

215
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:37,266
- looking for you and shit.
- I remember the helicopters.

216
00:13:37,308 --> 00:13:38,832
I was always wondering what the fuck
they were saying to each other.

217
00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:39,865
- Think about it.
- Really?

218
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,208
"Uh, looking for the kid

219
00:13:41,246 --> 00:13:42,474
who just jerked off. Over."

220
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:44,209
"Did he just come? Over."

221
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:47,515
"Negativo, Ghost Rider.
Looking for a case of blue balls. Over."

222
00:13:47,553 --> 00:13:49,953
It was like a scene from "The Fugitive,"
but with a naked kid.

223
00:13:49,989 --> 00:13:52,550
Yeah, that's not really proper
pilot speak, but I guess...

224
00:13:52,593 --> 00:13:54,754
I'm just saying we had
some good times.

225
00:13:54,795 --> 00:13:57,230
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

226
00:13:57,265 --> 00:13:59,256
The hell happened, do you think?

227
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,901
High school.

228
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:07,202
Yeah, no doubt.

229
00:14:09,112 --> 00:14:11,877
Hey, look, you know, I was driving
by the old 'hood yesterday.

230
00:14:13,151 --> 00:14:15,382
You remember that tree house,
that lockbox we built?

231
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,984
Yeah, sure. Still there?

232
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:22,757
Wanna go find out?

233
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,827
- Awesome.
- Oh, my God.

234
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,532
What?

235
00:14:31,573 --> 00:14:34,975
Oh, man, all this shit was
so important back in the day, man.

236
00:14:35,011 --> 00:14:36,535
- Henry: Look at these.
- What?

237
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:38,571
- You look like a fat Billy Ray Cyrus.
- Yo, wait, man.

238
00:14:38,615 --> 00:14:41,379
We should be fuckir high for this.

239
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:46,348
This is pharmaceutical-grade
Hindu Kush.

240
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:48,121
What? Do you have
a prescription for weed?

241
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,325
- You don't?
- What? What does that...

242
00:14:52,365 --> 00:14:54,094
You haven't gotten
high before, have you?

243
00:14:55,402 --> 00:14:57,928
You're afraid you're gonna end up
ripping down big loads

244
00:14:57,972 --> 00:15:00,406
in a cave
with the Shoe Bomber?

245
00:15:04,913 --> 00:15:08,645
Getting high, it's... it's like freedom.

246
00:15:09,652 --> 00:15:13,589
Smells, tastes, feelings...

247
00:15:13,624 --> 00:15:18,824
they all become, like,
four-dimensional.

248
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:20,492
When everyting irie,

249
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:22,660
everyting go twing twing.

250
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:27,068
Yeah, let me...

251
00:15:27,107 --> 00:15:30,771
- Fuck it.
- Be somebody.

252
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,315
So it begins.

253
00:15:48,566 --> 00:15:51,161
Can't wait to have an ex-wife, man.

254
00:15:51,203 --> 00:15:53,171
Can't wait for that shit.

255
00:15:53,205 --> 00:15:54,571
Whers the good part kick in?

256
00:15:54,607 --> 00:15:56,802
Like the... like
the fourth-dimensional stuff.

257
00:15:56,843 --> 00:15:58,835
I want the freedom.
Whers the freedom kick in, Breaux?

258
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:01,143
L... I want the freedom.

259
00:16:02,616 --> 00:16:04,244
Should we even be here right now?

260
00:16:04,286 --> 00:16:06,083
I mean, won't people
get suspicious?

261
00:16:06,121 --> 00:16:08,522
I mean, they'll call the cops,
send helicopters.

262
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:10,753
I hate fucking helicopters.

263
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:12,989
No, nobody's gonna
do anything, man.

264
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,054
We're trespassing.

265
00:16:14,097 --> 00:16:15,826
I mean, do you feel this?

266
00:16:15,866 --> 00:16:18,335
'Cause, holy shit, I mean,
I don't even think this is...

267
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:23,472
Oh, God.

268
00:16:25,411 --> 00:16:26,400
- You okay?
- The freedom hasn't

269
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:28,073
kicked in yet, asshole!

270
00:16:28,114 --> 00:16:32,415
Hey, what we need to do
right now is just relax.

271
00:16:35,323 --> 00:16:37,383
Fuck, God damn it!

272
00:16:37,426 --> 00:16:39,826
Where are you?!

273
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:42,353
Where the fuck are you?!

274
00:16:42,398 --> 00:16:45,128
Helicopters everywhere!

275
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:46,932
Everywhere!

276
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:49,303
Breaux over radio: Uh, looking
for the kid who just jerked off. Over.

277
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,036
Did he just come? Over.

278
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:54,603
Negativo, Ghost Rider.
Looking for a case of blue balls. Over.

279
00:17:06,427 --> 00:17:09,989
There were helicopters.
They were hunting me down.

280
00:17:15,972 --> 00:17:18,634
- It's your phone.
- Shit.

281
00:17:18,675 --> 00:17:20,166
What time is it?

282
00:17:21,612 --> 00:17:23,740
Party time.

283
00:17:23,782 --> 00:17:24,908
- Hey.
- Girl: Henry, where are you?

284
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,939
- I'm so sorry.
- We're all here waiting for you.

285
00:17:25,984 --> 00:17:27,679
- Yeah, I'll be there in 20. Fuck!
- What's going on?

286
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:30,154
I'm borrowing this. I gotta go
to the annual bake sale prep.

287
00:17:30,189 --> 00:17:31,679
- Can you drive?
- You wanna go now?

288
00:17:31,724 --> 00:17:33,659
Yeah. Yeah, I wanna go now.

289
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:36,561
All right, man.
Well, I want some road-head, then.

290
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,463
I hope you're good
at swallowing, bro.

291
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,161
It's how I like it.

292
00:17:46,676 --> 00:17:49,043
- Ahh.
- We need some more green.

293
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:53,312
- Boy: She's got ass for days.
- Boner.

294
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,520
Hey, Sharky. What's crackir?
What's crack-a-lackir?

295
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,358
Girl:
Good job. Good, good.

296
00:18:03,396 --> 00:18:05,227
Hey, Sharky. What's crackir?

297
00:18:05,265 --> 00:18:07,427
- What's crack-a-lackir?
- What up, tough guy?

298
00:18:07,468 --> 00:18:08,526
- Hey, Sharky...
- Oh!

299
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:10,503
I got it.

300
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:11,733
Fuck!

301
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:17,074
Oh, I just got my eyebrow
pierced yesterday!

302
00:18:24,355 --> 00:18:26,381
- About freakir time.
- Hey, guys. Sorry.

303
00:18:26,424 --> 00:18:29,484
- You're such a fucking asshole.
- What?

304
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:31,086
Sharky Ovante
just gave you an opening!

305
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,099
Microscopic, but still.
You blew it.

306
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:35,829
Yeah.

307
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:38,633
We grew up next door
to each other.

308
00:18:38,672 --> 00:18:40,800
We used to play together

309
00:18:40,842 --> 00:18:42,469
till she grew breasts.

310
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,035
And that was that.

311
00:18:47,182 --> 00:18:49,708
I ran the numbers.

312
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,017
Assuming we both ace our finals,

313
00:18:52,055 --> 00:18:54,718
it seems to me
you have valedictorian

314
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,250
by 3/100ths of a percentage.

315
00:18:57,294 --> 00:18:59,627
Salutatorian is a pretty big deal,
too, Sebastian, so...

316
00:18:59,664 --> 00:19:01,791
- Still second place, though.
- Well, I suppose

317
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,826
the hinge upon which fate swings
is a capricious one.

318
00:19:04,871 --> 00:19:07,807
- Why are your eyes all red?
- Excuse me, everyone.

319
00:19:07,841 --> 00:19:09,206
Can I please have your attention?

320
00:19:09,243 --> 00:19:12,441
Very impressive, spirit team.
Can you please put her down?

321
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,913
Uh, hey, listen.

322
00:19:13,948 --> 00:19:16,974
We're doing a live
television interview outside,

323
00:19:17,018 --> 00:19:20,216
so if you could all just, you know,
stop throwing each other up in the air

324
00:19:20,256 --> 00:19:21,848
and keep the volume level down,
that'd be great.

325
00:19:21,891 --> 00:19:23,484
- Okay? Thank you.
- Sorry.

326
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:28,493
And now we'll go live
to Julia Louise Hugo

327
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:32,470
- at Morgan High School. Julia?
- In five, four, three, two...

328
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,438
I understand that you have
a statement regarding

329
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,669
your student, Charlyne Phuc,
who was recently arrested...

330
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:40,475
Miss Phuc is no longer
a student of this institution,

331
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,914
and I have requested
that her standing

332
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,578
as three-time
State Spelling Bee Champion

333
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,020
be officially revoked.

334
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,892
Morgan is one of the finest
high schools in this state.

335
00:19:54,931 --> 00:19:58,265
We demand excellence,
not inebriation.

336
00:19:58,302 --> 00:20:01,704
And to reassure our students,

337
00:20:01,739 --> 00:20:04,675
parents, faculty,
and board of regents

338
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,268
of this high standard,

339
00:20:06,312 --> 00:20:11,250
we are conducting
a controlled-substance screening

340
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:13,479
on campus tomorrow.

341
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,082
All students are required
to participate,

342
00:20:17,124 --> 00:20:20,652
and any student who does not
pass the screening

343
00:20:20,696 --> 00:20:22,994
will be immediately expelled.

344
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:29,401
Cheese and crackers.
No, no, no, no.

345
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,377
I was trying for genial
and it came off wimpy.

346
00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:36,346
I'd like to be stronger.
Could we try this again?

347
00:20:36,381 --> 00:20:38,441
We're live.

348
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:41,351
What?

349
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:43,379
No, no, no, it's great.
Keep shooting. Looks great.

350
00:20:43,423 --> 00:20:45,288
We gotta be clear
by tomorrow morning.

351
00:20:45,325 --> 00:20:47,088
- What drug?
- Shrooms.

352
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:48,959
- Yeah, we split an eighth.
- How long ago did you take them?

353
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,522
- Hmm. About an hour ago?
- What strain?

354
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:55,003
Hold on. Hey.
You know what strain we ate?

355
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:56,767
Dinosaur bones.

356
00:20:56,806 --> 00:20:59,240
- Are your parents home?
- I think.

357
00:20:59,276 --> 00:21:01,643
- Have you been drinking?
- Look at your face.

358
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,579
Did you smoke marijuana
with these mushrooms?

359
00:21:03,614 --> 00:21:05,343
It's all stroked out.

360
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:06,612
- Sorry.
- What?

361
00:21:06,652 --> 00:21:08,711
So it might be that shit
we ate on prom night.

362
00:21:08,754 --> 00:21:10,221
- I'm looking for Breaux.
- Gordors been pulling

363
00:21:10,255 --> 00:21:11,883
- this Nazi shit forever.
- Did you call the police?

364
00:21:11,925 --> 00:21:14,450
My dad's gonna cancel
the Spice Channel if I get expelled,

365
00:21:14,494 --> 00:21:17,191
beat me up
with my own severed cock.

366
00:21:17,231 --> 00:21:19,028
Let... yo, let me call you right back.

367
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:20,762
- What?
- You did this to me.

368
00:21:20,802 --> 00:21:22,963
Do you have any idea
how screwed I am right now?

369
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,906
Look, chill, man.
You're causing a scene.

370
00:21:26,943 --> 00:21:28,103
I'm causing a scene?

371
00:21:28,144 --> 00:21:31,911
Causing a scene? What?!

372
00:21:36,854 --> 00:21:38,754
What?

373
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,351
Look, there are other people

374
00:21:41,393 --> 00:21:43,224
trippir balls
pretty hard core right now.

375
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:44,594
Dude, I'm not like other people.

376
00:21:44,631 --> 00:21:46,121
Okay? I don't trip on balls.

377
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:49,659
Okay? If I'm busted, I can kiss
my MIT scholarship good-bye.

378
00:21:49,704 --> 00:21:51,968
My entire life
is on the line right now.

379
00:21:55,978 --> 00:21:58,447
Yeah, all right. Hey, you guys,
the pumpkins are trying to kill us.

380
00:21:58,481 --> 00:22:01,746
You gotta go talk to 'em.
Come on, seriously, go.

381
00:22:01,784 --> 00:22:03,810
- What's with them?
- Come on.

382
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,985
This is my cleansing box.
It's for emergency situations.

383
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:14,431
We've got goldenseal,
but I think they test for that now.

384
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:17,266
Tea regimen, but it takes
something like two to three days.

385
00:22:17,304 --> 00:22:19,363
There's always urine masks,
but sometimes your piss

386
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:20,532
can come out a little too clean.

387
00:22:20,574 --> 00:22:23,237
Like it's not even urine anymore.
It's Aquafina.

388
00:22:23,277 --> 00:22:25,245
Okay, so what else
do we have, man? Is that it?

389
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:26,507
There's the piss pump.

390
00:22:26,547 --> 00:22:28,914
It's classic, but if they frisk you,
they're gonna find it.

391
00:22:28,951 --> 00:22:30,646
- Right.
- The bottom line is anything you use

392
00:22:30,686 --> 00:22:33,520
will buy you a 40% chance
of passing.

393
00:22:35,825 --> 00:22:39,262
That's an F.
That's an F, Breaux.

394
00:22:39,296 --> 00:22:41,458
You know, this is what
they warn you about in that video.

395
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,832
It starts out fun until you start
clawing your eyes out

396
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:45,234
in a padded cell with al-Qaeda.

397
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,466
One hit could really ruin your life.

398
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,803
I mean, you could always
go around to high schools.

399
00:22:51,845 --> 00:22:55,213
You know, like,
"Don't be like me. I blew it.

400
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,583
Threw my life down
the garbage disposal...

401
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,317
for weed."

402
00:23:02,825 --> 00:23:04,349
Come on!

403
00:23:04,393 --> 00:23:07,295
- Hey, I'm playing, man.
- This is a big deal, Breaux.

404
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,195
I need your... this is a big deal!

405
00:23:09,232 --> 00:23:11,895
Yeah, I know, man.

406
00:23:22,882 --> 00:23:26,410
# Have you ever
watched the sun go down #

407
00:23:26,454 --> 00:23:29,720
# And you're thinking
'bout the world spinnir round? #

408
00:23:29,758 --> 00:23:32,852
# Have you ever
been high as fuck? #

409
00:23:36,532 --> 00:23:40,196
# You're in the bathroom mirror
talking to yourself #

410
00:23:40,237 --> 00:23:43,435
# And your dog's lookir at you
like you need help #

411
00:23:43,475 --> 00:23:47,241
# Have you ever been
high as fuck? #

412
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,425
Oh.

413
00:23:58,459 --> 00:24:00,689
Have you been throwing
cold cuts at my window?

414
00:24:00,728 --> 00:24:02,390
Yo, have you been crying?

415
00:24:05,768 --> 00:24:07,828
Yo, meet me
at the tree house, gangster.

416
00:24:07,871 --> 00:24:10,806
Yo, who the fuck touched my whip?

417
00:24:11,842 --> 00:24:13,002
Got you!

418
00:24:13,043 --> 00:24:14,670
"Sodium aluminum sul..."

419
00:24:14,712 --> 00:24:17,375
There's aluminum in this?
What the fuck?

420
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:24,215
Look, uh, what if we
walked in tomorrow,

421
00:24:24,257 --> 00:24:27,125
failed the drug test,
and no one even noticed?

422
00:24:27,161 --> 00:24:29,823
What if you could fail and still be
valedictorian and still go to MIT?

423
00:24:29,863 --> 00:24:32,332
- Jesus Christ, you're high again.
- Yeah, I'm always high...

424
00:24:32,367 --> 00:24:34,028
Dude, that's a stoner fantasy, man.

425
00:24:34,068 --> 00:24:35,661
How could I fail the drug test
and no one care?

426
00:24:35,704 --> 00:24:37,763
- If everyone fails.
- Of course.

427
00:24:37,807 --> 00:24:39,867
If we can't pass the test, fine.

428
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,434
Fuck it.
Let's get the whole school high.

429
00:24:41,478 --> 00:24:43,036
Oh, my God.
Please tell me you're kidding.

430
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,775
Tomorrow is the bake sale, right?

431
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:48,775
We swap in bud brownies,
everyone gets blazed, everyone fails.

432
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,482
They'll have to throw
the test results away.

433
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,217
We won't even use a lot.
All right?

434
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:55,785
Just enough to muddy the waters.
They'll barely test positive.

435
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:58,424
Most people won't even notice.
They'll just be a little slow.

436
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:01,665
- A little slow.
- At times like this,

437
00:25:01,702 --> 00:25:03,568
you need to think like a stoner.

438
00:25:10,213 --> 00:25:13,150
Where are we gonna get
that much weed?

439
00:25:27,601 --> 00:25:30,263
- What?
- What?

440
00:25:30,303 --> 00:25:32,499
What? What?

441
00:25:35,476 --> 00:25:37,001
You're right.

442
00:25:39,848 --> 00:25:42,784
I harvested the crop
a few hours too early.

443
00:25:50,261 --> 00:25:52,696
Ah! I'm so stupid.

444
00:25:52,731 --> 00:25:55,826
Fuckir... so fuckir stupid!

445
00:25:58,704 --> 00:26:00,639
Stupid!

446
00:26:04,444 --> 00:26:07,073
- What?
- What?

447
00:26:07,115 --> 00:26:09,880
What? What?

448
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,819
I'm sorry.

449
00:26:11,854 --> 00:26:14,049
I hate for you to see me this way.

450
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:17,388
What?

451
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:22,094
There's this guy... Psycho Ed.

452
00:26:22,133 --> 00:26:24,967
He was like a child prodigy.

453
00:26:25,003 --> 00:26:27,494
Graduated from high school at 15.

454
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:30,907
Passed the bar exam
before he was old enough to drink.

455
00:26:30,944 --> 00:26:33,743
But then he went
to a foam party in Baja,

456
00:26:33,781 --> 00:26:37,842
smoked a dust blunt
supposedly laced with PCP,

457
00:26:37,886 --> 00:26:40,047
burned something out
in his fuckir brain.

458
00:26:40,088 --> 00:26:41,749
Dropped out the legit world
and became...

459
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,691
Let me guess... a drug dealer.

460
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:46,490
Yeah, but he's got this shit...
it's better than weed.

461
00:26:46,529 --> 00:26:49,465
It's called kief,
and it's really hard to make

462
00:26:49,499 --> 00:26:52,094
because you need a massive crop
of some crypto-dank herb

463
00:26:52,136 --> 00:26:55,697
on a 32-part-per-million
flowering solution cycle.

464
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,402
Psycho Ed:
Calculated to harvest each bud

465
00:26:57,443 --> 00:27:01,574
when its psychoactive component
is at its absolute apex.

466
00:27:01,614 --> 00:27:05,345
Then I process the buds
to extract the excess THC,

467
00:27:05,385 --> 00:27:07,581
the fruit of an entire harvest.

468
00:27:07,621 --> 00:27:11,718
One misstep
and the crystals are history.

469
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,558
This is kief.

470
00:27:14,596 --> 00:27:17,498
This will seriously

471
00:27:17,533 --> 00:27:20,765
fuck you up.

472
00:27:24,441 --> 00:27:26,808
Hold on, m-man.
You... you want to steal

473
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:29,211
a psycho drug dealer's
personal kief?

474
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,273
Precisely.

475
00:27:32,952 --> 00:27:35,717
Look, the Daves scored a dime bag
from him this afternoon,

476
00:27:35,756 --> 00:27:37,621
took a look at the place,
told me the whole setup,

477
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:39,683
- where the keys are.
- Man, this is insane!

478
00:27:39,727 --> 00:27:43,754
- I can't do this!
- You can. It's not.

479
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:45,426
Look, I know what you're thinking.

480
00:27:45,467 --> 00:27:48,231
- You know, he's got a gun...
- No.

481
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,432
Breaux, I was not thinking that.

482
00:27:50,473 --> 00:27:53,739
Look, at times like this, we can't think
about the things that could go wrong.

483
00:27:53,778 --> 00:27:55,803
We just gotta grab the balls
and go for it.

484
00:27:55,846 --> 00:27:59,078
- The balls. I'm grabbing the balls.
- Exactly.

485
00:27:59,117 --> 00:28:00,709
Whose balls? Stop, Breaux.

486
00:28:00,752 --> 00:28:03,745
- No, I can't do this, man.
- It's easy, okay?

487
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,883
Just hop the back fence,
wait for my signal,

488
00:28:05,925 --> 00:28:07,893
and then bing, bang,
boom, and we dip.

489
00:28:07,928 --> 00:28:09,520
What kind of plan is that?

490
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:12,191
Breaux. Fuck.

491
00:28:16,771 --> 00:28:18,865
"Beware of my fucking dog."

492
00:28:29,954 --> 00:28:31,546
- Fuck!
- Hey.

493
00:28:31,589 --> 00:28:34,855
What the fuck are you doing out here?
Come on, get in here. Come on.

494
00:28:34,893 --> 00:28:36,555
- Come on! Get in here!
- Okay, okay.

495
00:28:36,596 --> 00:28:39,565
- Have you been crying again?
- Fuck off.

496
00:28:40,934 --> 00:28:42,527
Okay.

497
00:28:43,604 --> 00:28:47,200
It's really dicey in here,
so give me exactly one minute

498
00:28:47,242 --> 00:28:49,403
and then get the key from the door
and head to the back.

499
00:28:49,444 --> 00:28:51,845
He keeps the kief
in a freezer in the grow room.

500
00:28:51,881 --> 00:28:54,315
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, I'm serious.

501
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,945
Fuck. Fuck.

502
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:58,477
Oh, my God.

503
00:28:58,522 --> 00:29:01,924
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Okay. Okay.

504
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,360
All right.

505
00:29:04,395 --> 00:29:06,956
Okay, okay.

506
00:29:16,911 --> 00:29:20,040
Ain't a strip club, you fuck.

507
00:29:50,752 --> 00:29:53,085
Thanks, brother man.

508
00:29:53,122 --> 00:29:55,386
Everybody says your weed
is the dank shit.

509
00:29:58,461 --> 00:30:01,055
Yeah, well, everyone's right.

510
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:03,556
Time for you
to get the fuck out.

511
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:07,060
Well, what about, you know,
weed etiquette?

512
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,470
What?

513
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:10,975
You know, now I'm supposed
to smoke you out with your own shit.

514
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,171
It's like weed tax.

515
00:30:15,582 --> 00:30:18,575
Do I look like I need you
to get me stoned?

516
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:22,222
My God,

517
00:30:22,257 --> 00:30:25,158
looks like somebody poured
snake blood in your eyeballs.

518
00:30:25,193 --> 00:30:26,957
Thanks.

519
00:30:28,764 --> 00:30:31,029
Maybe you could
give me some advice?

520
00:30:31,068 --> 00:30:32,558
What?

521
00:30:32,603 --> 00:30:34,902
I bought some seeds online...

522
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:36,372
- Oh!
- Moron!

523
00:30:36,407 --> 00:30:38,432
Never buy anything online.

524
00:30:47,954 --> 00:30:49,980
This botanist in Portland

525
00:30:50,024 --> 00:30:51,286
knows how to make
the most of what you got.

526
00:30:51,325 --> 00:30:52,314
And where to grow.

527
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,693
Yo, could you print this out
for me, bromeslice?

528
00:31:01,404 --> 00:31:04,897
That's Paranoid.

529
00:31:04,942 --> 00:31:08,379
- Yo, why do they call you Paranoid?
- What? Why you wanna know, man?

530
00:31:21,295 --> 00:31:23,890
Yo, is that, like... is that like
an alarm or something?

531
00:31:30,339 --> 00:31:32,331
Timer.

532
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:37,637
I'm fully automated.

533
00:31:50,063 --> 00:31:52,362
Oh, shit.

534
00:32:07,451 --> 00:32:09,476
Now piss off.

535
00:32:15,627 --> 00:32:17,754
Shh...

536
00:32:19,466 --> 00:32:21,661
- What the hell is that?
- That's the alarm.

537
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:22,690
Ah.

538
00:32:28,008 --> 00:32:29,408
He's got the deep beef.

539
00:32:29,444 --> 00:32:31,435
You better not be fuckir with me.

540
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,278
I told you not to fuck with me.

541
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,992
Hey, who the fuck are you, man?

542
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:48,694
- What, does ganja affect your hearing?
- What?

543
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:51,032
I've been knocking for,
like, five minutes.

544
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,868
I'll punch you in the head, man.

545
00:32:52,906 --> 00:32:54,874
Who the fuck is this guy, bro?

546
00:32:54,908 --> 00:32:56,933
- You told him your name?
- What?

547
00:32:56,978 --> 00:32:59,538
- Huh?
- He's my... he's my ride, my ride.

548
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,275
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm his ride.

549
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:03,580
Come on, man,
we gotta get the car back

550
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:05,280
before my dad gets back.

551
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,915
He's a renegade cop
with a power mullet.

552
00:33:07,957 --> 00:33:09,618
Works the late shift,

553
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:12,254
likes to shoot things.

554
00:33:12,296 --> 00:33:13,786
- Hey.
- What?

555
00:33:16,968 --> 00:33:18,492
Hmm?

556
00:33:20,105 --> 00:33:22,370
- Yo.
- What?

557
00:33:24,444 --> 00:33:26,140
- What?
- What?

558
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,080
What? What?

559
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:34,154
Yo, you woke my frog, cunt.

560
00:33:35,391 --> 00:33:37,450
Frogs sleep?

561
00:33:38,461 --> 00:33:39,952
- What?
- What?

562
00:33:39,996 --> 00:33:41,190
- What?
- What?

563
00:33:41,231 --> 00:33:42,664
What?

564
00:33:44,201 --> 00:33:47,467
Adios, muchacho.
Muchísimas gracias.

565
00:33:47,505 --> 00:33:50,669
Hey, next time,
leave Chong at home.

566
00:33:51,743 --> 00:33:54,178
Okay.

567
00:33:54,214 --> 00:33:55,704
- What?
- What?

568
00:33:55,748 --> 00:33:57,943
- What? What?
- Jesus fucking Christ.

569
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:01,519
Yo! G-G-Go!

570
00:34:01,555 --> 00:34:02,886
Go, go, go, go, go.

571
00:34:02,923 --> 00:34:04,653
- Who sent you?!
- Holy shit!

572
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:11,227
973 kids at least,
two two-inch brownies apiece.

573
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:13,395
We're gonna need 42 boxes
of brownie mix, 15 dozen eggs...

574
00:34:13,437 --> 00:34:15,064
- Oh, shit!
- 11 bottles of canola oil, and...

575
00:34:15,105 --> 00:34:17,198
- Hector, clean-up on aisle two.
- Fuck.

576
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:18,903
- Hey, these are on sale.
- So what, man?

577
00:34:18,943 --> 00:34:21,173
These are the ones that taste good.

578
00:34:21,212 --> 00:34:22,407
Wait, wait, wait.
This is white cake.

579
00:34:22,448 --> 00:34:23,881
It's for me.

580
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:28,377
# Stained roads #

581
00:34:28,421 --> 00:34:31,185
# Opposite direction #

582
00:34:31,224 --> 00:34:34,092
# Hearts are feeling cold #

583
00:34:34,128 --> 00:34:37,292
# Minds are dejected #

584
00:34:37,332 --> 00:34:40,233
# We want the same things #

585
00:34:40,269 --> 00:34:43,535
# Not just for ourselves #

586
00:34:43,573 --> 00:34:46,543
# Created for me #

587
00:34:46,577 --> 00:34:49,375
# A personal hell... #

588
00:35:02,162 --> 00:35:04,255
# Take this #

589
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,128
# Take this with you #

590
00:35:08,169 --> 00:35:10,661
# The two do not exist #

591
00:35:10,706 --> 00:35:12,799
# In conjunction... #

592
00:35:12,841 --> 00:35:15,470
Dr. Gordon,
the board members are here to see you.

593
00:35:15,512 --> 00:35:19,381
This is the most important day
of your life.

594
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:28,959
# Hold on to #

595
00:35:28,995 --> 00:35:32,158
# These ebbs and flows #

596
00:35:32,198 --> 00:35:35,657
# Please, please, please,
don't let me... #

597
00:35:35,703 --> 00:35:37,534
Move. Dump them out, man.
We gotta go, quick.

598
00:35:37,571 --> 00:35:39,369
No shit.

599
00:35:42,043 --> 00:35:43,102
Let's go.
Come on, we gotta move.

600
00:35:43,145 --> 00:35:45,511
- Shut up.
- Quicker, quicker, quicker. Let's go.

601
00:35:45,548 --> 00:35:47,072
- Okay.
- Come on.

602
00:35:47,116 --> 00:35:50,280
- # Don't cut me, cut me out #
- There's a car here.

603
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,449
A shepherd must be held
accountable for his sheep.

604
00:35:53,491 --> 00:35:55,652
That is why I welcome
the board's review

605
00:35:55,693 --> 00:35:59,494
of our new zero-tolerance policy
on controlled substances.

606
00:35:59,531 --> 00:36:01,830
Today, Morgan High
is conducting

607
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:05,065
its first ever student screening.

608
00:36:05,105 --> 00:36:08,098
No drug tests! No drug tests!

609
00:36:13,682 --> 00:36:15,172
Greetings, fellow Patriots.

610
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:17,812
This is your assistant dean,
Brandon.

611
00:36:17,854 --> 00:36:20,049
Just a reminder that today

612
00:36:20,089 --> 00:36:23,890
is the annual end-of-the-year
PTA bake sale

613
00:36:23,927 --> 00:36:25,793
with benefits going toward

614
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:30,062
the band and track team
to get new uniforms.

615
00:36:30,101 --> 00:36:34,061
So don't count calories
or carbs today.

616
00:36:34,106 --> 00:36:35,870
You know I'm not.

617
00:36:35,909 --> 00:36:39,310
# Necessity... #

618
00:36:40,581 --> 00:36:42,947
Today is the dawning
of a new era here at Morgan.

619
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:47,748
And I, Dr. Leslie Gordon,

620
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,884
give you my personal assurance

621
00:36:49,926 --> 00:36:51,621
that you will never, ever

622
00:36:51,661 --> 00:36:53,891
hear of another student
from Morgan High

623
00:36:53,931 --> 00:36:57,560
being under the influence
of any illicit drug

624
00:36:58,569 --> 00:37:00,561
ever again.

625
00:37:07,046 --> 00:37:08,139
Punch?

626
00:37:09,149 --> 00:37:12,243
These are fuckir good.

627
00:37:19,428 --> 00:37:21,487
All right, kids, we're only gonna
get a few more chances

628
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,466
to do this this year,
so here we go.

629
00:37:24,501 --> 00:37:27,699
10, nine, eight...

630
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:29,570
I really don't like doing this...

631
00:37:29,607 --> 00:37:31,768
seven, six...

632
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,539
this is not a test...

633
00:37:33,579 --> 00:37:35,979
five, four...

634
00:37:36,014 --> 00:37:39,507
get to class.

635
00:37:44,725 --> 00:37:46,819
But... but was it...

636
00:37:48,663 --> 00:37:50,928
Chicken quesadilla?

637
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,636
What?

638
00:38:12,492 --> 00:38:14,153
Shit.

639
00:38:14,194 --> 00:38:16,288
What's the matter, man?

640
00:38:18,332 --> 00:38:20,494
I could fix you another one.

641
00:38:22,938 --> 00:38:24,873
Yo, Edwin, you all right, man?

642
00:38:24,908 --> 00:38:26,842
Chad, please take the roll sheet

643
00:38:26,876 --> 00:38:29,004
to the administration office.

644
00:38:29,046 --> 00:38:31,037
- Chad!
- What?

645
00:38:31,081 --> 00:38:32,981
What? What?

646
00:38:33,017 --> 00:38:35,782
The roll sheet to the office.

647
00:38:35,821 --> 00:38:38,347
Oh, shit.

648
00:38:44,965 --> 00:38:47,559
Just go.

649
00:38:47,601 --> 00:38:50,435
Dana, Jeffrey, please read
today's announcements.

650
00:38:56,946 --> 00:38:58,437
Wha... what?

651
00:38:58,481 --> 00:39:01,678
I got webbed hands.
L... I've never noticed that.

652
00:39:21,643 --> 00:39:23,304
What?

653
00:39:23,345 --> 00:39:25,746
Name?

654
00:39:26,749 --> 00:39:28,239
Name!

655
00:39:31,288 --> 00:39:33,882
Uh...

656
00:39:33,924 --> 00:39:36,689
I have a nickname.

657
00:39:36,728 --> 00:39:40,859
Finger.
Oh, and, um, Acorn Dick.

658
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,528
It's un... it's unfortunate.

659
00:39:43,569 --> 00:39:45,629
So which one do you want first?

660
00:39:46,806 --> 00:39:49,867
Hands up.
Got any sharp objects? Needles?

661
00:39:49,911 --> 00:39:52,345
Porta-Potty to your left.
Here is the plastic...

662
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,440
I like your... your tats.

663
00:39:54,483 --> 00:39:58,078
You're not on the Suicide Girls
website, are you?

664
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,318
Does this nurse look
totally insectoid to you?

665
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,758
Thought I saw you on there.

666
00:40:03,794 --> 00:40:05,261
I'll text you.

667
00:40:05,296 --> 00:40:08,323
What the fuck, man?
People are losing their shit right now.

668
00:40:08,366 --> 00:40:10,357
According to... according to
"Stoner of the Year,"

669
00:40:10,402 --> 00:40:13,395
bud brownies are the most dangerous
and terrifying inebriate.

670
00:40:13,439 --> 00:40:15,407
The thing about them is you keep
getting higher and higher.

671
00:40:15,441 --> 00:40:18,411
It does not stop.
How much kief did you use, man?

672
00:40:18,445 --> 00:40:22,883
Uh, you know, a smidge, a shake,
a Martha Stewart steeze.

673
00:40:24,852 --> 00:40:27,822
Okay, I spilled it, all right?
A shit-load.

674
00:40:27,856 --> 00:40:28,880
- All right...
- Sebastian: Did you hear?

675
00:40:28,924 --> 00:40:31,620
Someone locked the PTA moms
in the weight room.

676
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:35,688
Looks like Dean Gordon installed
that new surveillance system

677
00:40:35,732 --> 00:40:37,564
just in time.

678
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,602
Oh, right, you wouldn't know.

679
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:44,233
I mean, I only know
because, of course,

680
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:47,371
you know, I tutor his son Mark
and I overheard it.

681
00:40:47,413 --> 00:40:50,576
Cameras everywhere.

682
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:54,075
It's an Orwellian wet dream.

683
00:41:01,998 --> 00:41:03,488
- Henry, slow down.
- We're going to jail.

684
00:41:03,532 --> 00:41:05,160
- Gordon caught us on camera.
- We don't know that.

685
00:41:05,202 --> 00:41:07,670
- And even if he did, we can fix this.
- Yeah? How?

686
00:41:07,704 --> 00:41:09,604
I don't know, the footage...
we don't even know if they watched it.

687
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:11,904
- We'll just fuckir find it.
- Dr. Gordors son.

688
00:41:11,943 --> 00:41:13,570
Let's go have a chat
with that veining dildo.

689
00:41:13,611 --> 00:41:15,079
Wait, no, no, no. I can't.
I'm late for my first final.

690
00:41:15,114 --> 00:41:16,206
Forget your final.
This is important.

691
00:41:16,248 --> 00:41:18,216
You don't get it, man. If I screw up
my final, I'm just as fucked.

692
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,741
Okay, I'll find that pimply dipshit
and then I'll text you.

693
00:41:19,786 --> 00:41:21,488
All right.
Thanks, man.

694
00:41:22,889 --> 00:41:24,551
I'ma tell you what hurts...

695
00:41:24,592 --> 00:41:26,253
having a daddy with glaucoma.

696
00:41:26,293 --> 00:41:28,261
Old man couldn't see shit.

697
00:41:28,295 --> 00:41:31,493
So I tried to score him, you know,
an ounce of Chocolate Thai...

698
00:41:35,638 --> 00:41:37,799
Uh...

699
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:59,833
This is cra... this is crazy.

700
00:41:59,867 --> 00:42:03,133
We are proud to have awarded
an academic scholarship

701
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:07,007
to one of only three living
human beings to have beaten

702
00:42:07,043 --> 00:42:10,774
the Carnegie Mellon Red One
Supercomputer at chess:

703
00:42:10,814 --> 00:42:12,305
Edwin Hunter.

704
00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:16,878
Elo rated as the third best
chess player on the planet Earth.

705
00:42:19,124 --> 00:42:22,925
It looks like Edwin
will have the first move

706
00:42:22,962 --> 00:42:24,953
because he's white.

707
00:42:26,533 --> 00:42:31,562
I mean... the white pieces.

708
00:42:31,606 --> 00:42:34,131
White always goes first.

709
00:42:34,175 --> 00:42:36,474
I mean, that is...

710
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:39,481
the person with the white...
oh, look.

711
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:44,211
This pawn looks like
my Uncle Neville's

712
00:42:44,254 --> 00:42:46,450
elongated nipple.

713
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:52,326
- Rest in peace, you slut.
- Music! Ahem.

714
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:54,799
Would you all like to listen
to some music?

715
00:43:04,346 --> 00:43:05,540
Dude, the white judge...

716
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:09,312
the white judge knocked me
to the joint for 25 to life

717
00:43:09,352 --> 00:43:12,014
for some fuckir sinsemilla, man.

718
00:43:12,054 --> 00:43:14,114
We already heard
that one, too, asshole.

719
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:15,819
Well, the world need to hear it,

720
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:19,125
and they will in my book,

721
00:43:19,164 --> 00:43:21,826
"Alcatrizaz."

722
00:43:21,866 --> 00:43:23,391
Shit.

723
00:43:32,813 --> 00:43:35,281
That sounded like a wet fart.

724
00:43:35,316 --> 00:43:39,219
Well, you'd know, incontinent slank.

725
00:43:39,254 --> 00:43:41,883
What the hell is going on
around this place?

726
00:43:41,925 --> 00:43:43,859
Is someone trying
to sabotage me?

727
00:43:43,893 --> 00:43:48,228
- Are you trying to bring me down?
- Jesus, no. I've been paging you.

728
00:43:48,265 --> 00:43:52,100
No drug tests! No drug tests!

729
00:43:52,137 --> 00:43:54,435
Hmm.
Batteries must have died.

730
00:43:54,472 --> 00:43:57,408
Sir, we've had
an unusual number

731
00:43:57,443 --> 00:44:01,904
of students and faculty
complaining of...

732
00:44:01,949 --> 00:44:06,114
confusion and... and dizziness.

733
00:44:06,154 --> 00:44:08,622
I haven't been feeling
so sweet myself,

734
00:44:08,656 --> 00:44:11,524
so I was thinking that maybe
it was a gas leak,

735
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,425
so I called in

736
00:44:13,462 --> 00:44:17,695
an emergency...
work... thingy.

737
00:44:17,734 --> 00:44:21,034
I want answers. Brainstorm this thing.

738
00:44:21,072 --> 00:44:23,097
There he is!

739
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,701
What about our childrers
right to privacy?

740
00:44:25,744 --> 00:44:29,203
- No unlawful search and seizure.
- Yeah, fuck you!

741
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:32,616
- Fuck you!
- Man: Who do you think you are?!

742
00:44:32,652 --> 00:44:35,713
Oh, fuck, man.

743
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,290
Ah, shit.

744
00:44:41,329 --> 00:44:43,161
- Hey.
- What?

745
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:45,167
You made me drop
my ice cream.

746
00:44:45,201 --> 00:44:47,898
Why the fuck would you be eating it
like that on a day like today?

747
00:44:47,938 --> 00:44:51,840
Because it tastes ambrosian
when I'm buttstonked,

748
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:54,902
but don't tell the cops that
when they arrive.

749
00:44:54,946 --> 00:44:57,575
I'm on probation for a misdemeanor
possession charge.

750
00:44:57,616 --> 00:44:59,550
- What?
- Shit.

751
00:44:59,585 --> 00:45:02,521
You didn't think about gettir
no fuckir Slurpee, kid?

752
00:45:02,555 --> 00:45:03,920
You like Slurpees, don't you?

753
00:45:03,957 --> 00:45:06,255
- Who me?
- No, the...

754
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:11,925
Man:
Oh, man.

755
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:15,970
- Fuck.
- What?

756
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:18,166
- What?
- Shit.

757
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:21,336
- Fuck.
- What?

758
00:45:21,378 --> 00:45:24,176
- Fuck.
- Paranoid and Charlyne: What?

759
00:45:24,214 --> 00:45:26,342
- What?
- Fuck.

760
00:45:26,384 --> 00:45:28,181
What?!

761
00:45:32,124 --> 00:45:34,149
Get the fuck out of here.

762
00:45:46,742 --> 00:45:50,179
- I'm melting!
- Martin.

763
00:45:50,213 --> 00:45:53,410
How many brownies did you eat?

764
00:45:57,054 --> 00:46:00,650
- 14?
- Jesus H. Christ.

765
00:46:02,928 --> 00:46:04,726
Martin, look at me.

766
00:46:04,764 --> 00:46:07,426
You are really stoned right now, man.

767
00:46:07,467 --> 00:46:10,028
You look like you're about
to summit Mt. Zion.

768
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:11,799
We'll tell your daddy.

769
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,469
You could get expelled, little man.

770
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:18,309
Where do they record
the security footage?

771
00:46:18,347 --> 00:46:20,941
Huh? Huh?

772
00:46:20,983 --> 00:46:22,781
- Come on, man.
- Give the fuckir milk.

773
00:46:22,819 --> 00:46:24,719
Tell us, Martin,
and you get the milk.

774
00:46:24,755 --> 00:46:26,723
In the library,
in... in the back room.

775
00:46:26,757 --> 00:46:29,591
- My daddy has the keys.
- Okay, okay, okay.

776
00:46:29,627 --> 00:46:31,788
If you speak a word of this
to anyone and I'll make sure

777
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:33,559
what you're feeling right now
is permanent.

778
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,033
I'm the pope of dope.
I can make that happen.

779
00:46:36,068 --> 00:46:38,435
Maybe I just dosed the milk
you just downed

780
00:46:38,471 --> 00:46:41,167
with high-grade liquid acid.

781
00:46:41,207 --> 00:46:43,335
Keep your mouth shut, homes.

782
00:46:45,513 --> 00:46:47,277
Well, did you?!

783
00:46:53,089 --> 00:46:55,614
Die, Leonard! Die!

784
00:46:55,658 --> 00:46:57,991
I'm gonna murder you!

785
00:46:58,028 --> 00:46:59,859
Perhaps you'd like some lunch?

786
00:46:59,897 --> 00:47:01,490
This is great, man.

787
00:47:01,533 --> 00:47:02,966
How are we supposed to get
the keys from him?

788
00:47:03,001 --> 00:47:04,866
Are you joking?
I wanna see what it looks like

789
00:47:04,903 --> 00:47:06,064
when someone is murdered.

790
00:47:06,105 --> 00:47:07,333
Ah!

791
00:47:07,373 --> 00:47:09,068
What if we could unlock
the surveillance room

792
00:47:09,108 --> 00:47:10,508
without even going near
Dr. Gordon?

793
00:47:10,544 --> 00:47:12,671
How, man? How?

794
00:47:23,492 --> 00:47:28,123
# Watch out,
here we go again #

795
00:47:28,164 --> 00:47:33,193
# Just say my name
and I will bend #

796
00:47:33,237 --> 00:47:36,674
# I'll kill you with my words #

797
00:47:36,708 --> 00:47:39,735
# And I'll kill you with mine... #

798
00:47:44,485 --> 00:47:45,975
Gordors a psycho.

799
00:47:46,019 --> 00:47:47,509
He canceled his wife's
gym membership

800
00:47:47,554 --> 00:47:49,182
because he thought
she was fucking her trainer,

801
00:47:49,224 --> 00:47:51,749
but gave her a spare set of keys
so she could work out here.

802
00:47:51,793 --> 00:47:54,285
Must keep in shape
with all the sport fucking she does.

803
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,821
- Wait, what?
- She's a cougar, dipshit.

804
00:47:56,866 --> 00:47:58,459
A fucking coug.

805
00:47:58,502 --> 00:48:00,800
What school have you been going to?
Everybody's fucked her, man.

806
00:48:00,837 --> 00:48:02,738
- I-I haven't.
- Well, everyone but you.

807
00:48:02,773 --> 00:48:04,673
- You haven't.
- Everyone but us.

808
00:48:04,709 --> 00:48:06,472
- The Daves?
- Shut the fuck up, all right!

809
00:48:06,511 --> 00:48:08,844
It's a breeze.
I go out there, I distract her...

810
00:48:08,881 --> 00:48:09,870
Wait, let me guess,
let me guess.

811
00:48:09,915 --> 00:48:12,942
While... while I commit another felony,
sneak into the mers locker room,

812
00:48:12,986 --> 00:48:14,681
and then bing, bang,
boom, and we dip.

813
00:48:14,721 --> 00:48:15,710
- Exactly.
- Right.

814
00:48:15,755 --> 00:48:18,156
You grab the keys from her purse
while we're having sex.

815
00:48:18,192 --> 00:48:19,682
What?

816
00:48:19,727 --> 00:48:24,131
# Just say my name
and I will bend #

817
00:48:24,165 --> 00:48:26,157
# With mine. #

818
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:35,712
Mind if I turn up the heat?

819
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:40,776
Wha... what do you...
what do you think you're doing?

820
00:48:40,819 --> 00:48:42,946
Having a hell of a day.

821
00:48:42,988 --> 00:48:44,854
Thought I'd chill
the fuck out in the pool.

822
00:48:44,891 --> 00:48:46,688
You know, get out of here.

823
00:48:46,726 --> 00:48:48,216
Get out of here
before you get yourself

824
00:48:48,261 --> 00:48:50,628
into some serious trouble,
young man. Okay?

825
00:48:53,334 --> 00:48:55,769
I won't tell if you won't.

826
00:49:00,076 --> 00:49:03,443
Look, how the hell
did you get in here?

827
00:49:03,479 --> 00:49:06,745
- Hmm?
- I'm... I'm into you.

828
00:49:06,784 --> 00:49:08,412
Seriously, I'm down.

829
00:49:10,388 --> 00:49:11,616
I'm calling the police.

830
00:49:11,656 --> 00:49:13,716
You shut your blood clat, Mommy.

831
00:49:13,759 --> 00:49:15,659
What do you tink
I came in here for?

832
00:49:15,695 --> 00:49:17,253
What did you just say?

833
00:49:17,296 --> 00:49:19,322
Let me peep them Babylons,
you ras-clat.

834
00:49:19,366 --> 00:49:20,697
All right, listen, you little bastard.

835
00:49:20,734 --> 00:49:23,295
I'm gonna have you arrested so fast
that your head will spin.

836
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:26,774
- Do you understand me?
- I ain't scared of no 5-0.

837
00:49:27,776 --> 00:49:29,437
- Why are you talking like that?
- What?

838
00:49:31,347 --> 00:49:33,339
Oh, yeah.

839
00:49:44,296 --> 00:49:46,424
- What is that?
- What?

840
00:49:46,466 --> 00:49:48,934
Oh, I hear it.

841
00:49:48,968 --> 00:49:52,370
How weird.
Is someone here?

842
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,067
Hello?

843
00:49:54,108 --> 00:49:56,304
Let's stop this.

844
00:49:56,344 --> 00:49:58,642
Amanda?

845
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,170
Hello?

846
00:50:00,215 --> 00:50:02,207
"Jizz coming out
of my Johnson..."

847
00:50:02,251 --> 00:50:04,811
- That's just creepy.
- I definitely hear somebody.

848
00:50:06,323 --> 00:50:09,224
"Hog in your mud..."

849
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:11,455
Administration office?

850
00:50:11,496 --> 00:50:13,760
- Pass the towel.
- No.

851
00:50:21,274 --> 00:50:24,403
- Huh, that was weird.
- Yeah.

852
00:50:24,445 --> 00:50:26,037
I can drive tonight if you want.

853
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,308
Fuck, yeah!

854
00:50:27,348 --> 00:50:29,579
You were like the star of your own
ninja porno back there...

855
00:50:29,618 --> 00:50:31,483
"Enter the Cougar."

856
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,355
- Watch this, biatch.
- There's the old sense of humor.

857
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,882
He's holding out on us, man.
I know it.

858
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,462
Fucking notebook?

859
00:50:45,904 --> 00:50:47,531
Español.

860
00:50:50,042 --> 00:50:52,067
What the hell is this shit?

861
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:05,527
Need to freshen up a bit.

862
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:15,795
This is gonna get ugly.

863
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,174
A case can be made that things
have already gotten pretty ugly, Edward.

864
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:23,378
You read my mind, man.

865
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:25,611
How you be doing
that fuckir shit?

866
00:51:27,254 --> 00:51:29,745
You guys better wait here.

867
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:32,351
- Gladly.
- Fuckir weirdos.

868
00:51:32,393 --> 00:51:34,384
Paranoid: Don't... don't...
don't make no eye contact.

869
00:51:34,429 --> 00:51:36,955
They've got laser blades.
They can reset your brain.

870
00:51:37,967 --> 00:51:39,457
Thanks for the warning.

871
00:51:40,537 --> 00:51:42,471
Flies in the web.
Yeah, we got 'em. Reel 'em.

872
00:51:51,216 --> 00:51:52,979
Okay, where's my piss pump?

873
00:51:53,018 --> 00:51:55,783
We have to rig that shit up
before we get chi-chi faced.

874
00:51:55,822 --> 00:51:57,187
Here.

875
00:52:00,261 --> 00:52:02,957
This one has a black
prosthetic dick, asshole.

876
00:52:02,997 --> 00:52:07,196
- What if they take a look, man?
- Maybe you just have a tan cock.

877
00:52:10,306 --> 00:52:11,933
Give me your cock.

878
00:52:11,974 --> 00:52:14,034
Looks Latino.

879
00:52:14,077 --> 00:52:15,874
Fine, take that cock.

880
00:52:15,913 --> 00:52:19,680
I'll wear your
black shriveled dick.

881
00:52:23,489 --> 00:52:24,979
Wait.

882
00:52:25,024 --> 00:52:29,121
Let's make sure there are
no motherfuckers in here listening.

883
00:53:13,415 --> 00:53:16,249
I'm a surveillance room key.
What do I look like?

884
00:53:16,286 --> 00:53:19,255
Move Neville's nipple
or suck on it already, biatch.

885
00:53:21,158 --> 00:53:23,626
- Try them again.
- I did, man, all of them. Twice.

886
00:53:23,661 --> 00:53:26,062
This must be the door.
So where's the fuckir key?

887
00:53:26,098 --> 00:53:27,827
What's poppir off, gentlemen?

888
00:53:27,866 --> 00:53:31,268
- Care for a bite, Henry?
- Uh, no, thanks.

889
00:53:31,304 --> 00:53:33,670
- I'm, uh, fasting.
- Oh, well, that's a shame.

890
00:53:33,706 --> 00:53:35,197
I've heard they're delicious.

891
00:53:35,242 --> 00:53:38,940
Too bad chocolate reminds me
of human feces.

892
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:41,448
- Weird day, isn't it?
- It's high school.

893
00:53:41,483 --> 00:53:45,614
Everyday is weird.
See you, Sebastian.

894
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:48,853
I found a dumpster full of brownies.

895
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:55,362
I ask you,

896
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,801
why would someone
wanna throw away

897
00:53:57,836 --> 00:54:00,202
so many perfectly good brownies?

898
00:54:02,007 --> 00:54:04,704
You should have a brownie.

899
00:54:04,744 --> 00:54:08,408
- Pure THC kills nausea.
- Henry: Fuck off, Doctor.

900
00:54:08,449 --> 00:54:12,716
- # I am the walrus! #
- Boy: Coo coo ca choo.

901
00:54:14,289 --> 00:54:16,223
We should get this whole school
high more often.

902
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:19,228
- More often?
- Yeah, on a scale

903
00:54:19,262 --> 00:54:22,096
between a prostate exam
and a reggae festival,

904
00:54:22,132 --> 00:54:24,430
it's somewhere around giving
your mother multiple orgasms.

905
00:54:24,468 --> 00:54:25,959
What kind of scale is that?

906
00:54:26,004 --> 00:54:28,837
You know, you find this
really fuckir funny, don't you?

907
00:54:28,873 --> 00:54:31,274
This could really tarnish
your .65 GPA.

908
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,438
I mean, your bright future is totally
hanging in the balance, Breaux.

909
00:54:37,284 --> 00:54:40,311
Yeah, I... I do have plans,
for your information.

910
00:54:40,355 --> 00:54:43,347
The Daves and I,
we wanna travel,

911
00:54:43,391 --> 00:54:46,850
learn to play the sitar, and then
eventually settle somewhere else.

912
00:54:46,895 --> 00:54:48,886
Maybe Nicaragua.

913
00:54:48,931 --> 00:54:52,095
You know, and I... I know buying land
out there can be pretty sketchy

914
00:54:52,135 --> 00:54:53,625
because the government
can pretty much jack it

915
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:56,435
whenever they want,
but fuck it, right?

916
00:54:56,474 --> 00:54:58,374
Wow, man.

917
00:54:58,409 --> 00:55:00,605
It's a hell of a plan, really.

918
00:55:00,645 --> 00:55:02,135
Oh, shit.

919
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:04,012
- What?
- Hi.

920
00:55:05,685 --> 00:55:06,811
Where is it?

921
00:55:06,853 --> 00:55:10,381
It's, uh... it's gone.
It's gone, man.

922
00:55:10,424 --> 00:55:12,585
What?

923
00:55:12,626 --> 00:55:14,993
That's impossible.

924
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:16,554
Where is it?

925
00:55:18,367 --> 00:55:23,101
There was enough kief to get
this whole fucking school high.

926
00:55:58,549 --> 00:56:02,042
You sick, twisted fucks.

927
00:56:04,055 --> 00:56:06,524
You did get the whole school high.

928
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:12,197
Now... now, that's just the most
mental thing I've ever seen.

929
00:56:18,739 --> 00:56:20,765
But you pinched
the wrong mars load.

930
00:56:20,809 --> 00:56:23,175
Okay, okay, we'll pay you back.
We'll pay it back, okay?

931
00:56:23,212 --> 00:56:26,478
- You don't have enough.
- There's cameras, there's cameras.

932
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:28,814
There's cameras?!

933
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:30,753
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- There's cameras?

934
00:56:30,788 --> 00:56:35,718
Where's the camera?
Where's the camera?

935
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,852
Huh? Huh?
Where's the camera?

936
00:56:36,895 --> 00:56:38,796
Where's the camera?
Is that a camera?

937
00:56:38,831 --> 00:56:40,162
- No, no. No, no, no. Okay.
- Oh, shit.

938
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:41,632
You think I give a fuck
about cameras?

939
00:56:41,667 --> 00:56:44,068
The bake sale...
they're raising money.

940
00:56:44,104 --> 00:56:45,594
- How much?
- I don't know! I don't know!

941
00:56:45,639 --> 00:56:47,903
I don't know.
We'll pay it back, we'll pay it back.

942
00:56:47,941 --> 00:56:49,773
- We'll find it.
- I want it in an hour.

943
00:56:49,811 --> 00:56:51,108
- Two hours.
- What the fuck?

944
00:56:51,146 --> 00:56:52,842
Two hours.
Please, please.

945
00:56:52,882 --> 00:56:54,645
That'll get you
till the end of the day.

946
00:56:55,885 --> 00:56:59,219
And then we're gonna
have a very

947
00:56:59,256 --> 00:57:02,658
serious talk.

948
00:57:02,693 --> 00:57:06,129
- Huh?
- Okay, okay, okay.

949
00:57:06,164 --> 00:57:09,623
Does this happen to you a lot?

950
00:57:09,668 --> 00:57:12,002
What the fuck are we gonna do
about that freak Sebastian

951
00:57:12,038 --> 00:57:13,528
and Dr. Gordors
surveillance footage?

952
00:57:13,573 --> 00:57:14,835
Fuck that. Let's worry about

953
00:57:14,874 --> 00:57:16,604
staying out of the morgue first,
then jail.

954
00:57:16,644 --> 00:57:18,305
- What?
- We find the bake sale cash box

955
00:57:18,345 --> 00:57:19,505
and we pay off Psycho Ed.

956
00:57:19,547 --> 00:57:20,536
And we have a whole two hours.

957
00:57:20,581 --> 00:57:21,810
- Right.
- "Thank you, Breaux."

958
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:24,478
Right, which gives us
till about 10 after 12.

959
00:57:24,519 --> 00:57:26,818
Fuck! No, I can't.
I've got my computer skills final.

960
00:57:26,856 --> 00:57:29,051
All right, I'll fuckir deal.
Go be a superstar.

961
00:57:29,091 --> 00:57:30,821
There's tape on the keys.

962
00:57:30,861 --> 00:57:33,193
- How am I supposed to type?
- Dana: It's a final, you 'tard.

963
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:35,323
You're not supposed
to see the keys.

964
00:57:37,068 --> 00:57:39,400
I think.

965
00:57:39,437 --> 00:57:41,099
Miss Unger?

966
00:57:42,141 --> 00:57:43,631
Hello?

967
00:57:44,945 --> 00:57:49,507
Hello. I was just drawing
a picture of my cat Bryan.

968
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:52,075
I named him after Bryan Adams.

969
00:57:52,119 --> 00:57:54,953
All right, let's take a test.

970
00:57:56,291 --> 00:58:01,423
Boy, he's a very sexy singer.

971
00:58:01,464 --> 00:58:05,128
I used to pretend
that my glass dildo

972
00:58:05,169 --> 00:58:09,971
was, in fact, Mr. Adams' erect

973
00:58:10,008 --> 00:58:14,378
glass-encased member...

974
00:58:14,413 --> 00:58:17,644
Because the forest wizard
had turned him to glass, of course.

975
00:58:17,683 --> 00:58:22,348
So only the moistened walls
of the village witch

976
00:58:22,389 --> 00:58:24,449
could return him to human form.

977
00:58:32,469 --> 00:58:35,097
Was that out loud
or did I just think that?

978
00:58:39,577 --> 00:58:41,511
Isn't this the administration office?

979
00:58:41,545 --> 00:58:44,777
No, it isn't.
It is my classroom.

980
00:58:45,851 --> 00:58:48,480
- I think.
- Are you fucking with me?

981
00:58:48,521 --> 00:58:52,549
Excuse me, is that the attendance list
I gave you this morning?

982
00:59:08,512 --> 00:59:11,311
You're positive Sharky
left the cash box in Gordors office?

983
00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:14,512
- Yeah. Look, the money's in there.
- Cool, cool.

984
00:59:14,552 --> 00:59:16,487
- So where's Sharky now?
- No, no, come on!

985
00:59:16,522 --> 00:59:19,924
Horny man, I need your magical,
geek power brain to be focused for this.

986
00:59:19,959 --> 00:59:21,620
No, man. Fuck that.

987
00:59:21,661 --> 00:59:23,288
I got the keys out of the womers
locker room, man.

988
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:24,821
- This one's yours.
- That was simple.

989
00:59:24,865 --> 00:59:27,959
I had to tame a cougar.
This is the administration office.

990
00:59:28,002 --> 00:59:29,368
Yeah, you're the career criminal, man.

991
00:59:29,404 --> 00:59:31,338
- This should be, like, easy for you.
- Right. You're right.

992
00:59:31,373 --> 00:59:34,070
L... I'm, you know, suspicious.

993
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:36,874
And you, you're the straight-arrow,
tight-ass geek.

994
00:59:36,913 --> 00:59:38,141
Oh, so maybe I should
smoke weed all day

995
00:59:38,181 --> 00:59:39,843
and I wouldn't have to do
any hard work.

996
00:59:39,883 --> 00:59:41,214
Yeah, well, maybe I should
get some straight As

997
00:59:41,251 --> 00:59:43,082
and hang out with some flip-flop
floobie-doos who eat glue.

998
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,180
Yeah, there's a minimum
IQ requirement to be in the auto club.

999
00:59:45,223 --> 00:59:49,251
Is there a minimum vagina
requirement to be in the IQ club?

1000
00:59:49,295 --> 00:59:51,627
No.

1001
00:59:56,403 --> 00:59:58,770
All right, we're gonna
have to clear the office.

1002
00:59:58,806 --> 01:00:01,604
Oh, fuck!

1003
01:00:01,642 --> 01:00:04,840
This is intense.

1004
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,438
Shit.

1005
01:00:06,482 --> 01:00:08,144
- There you are.
- Mom?

1006
01:00:08,184 --> 01:00:11,347
Oh, my God.
Dude, how blazed are you two?

1007
01:00:11,388 --> 01:00:14,381
You tried to hold out
on us, you fuck.

1008
01:00:15,393 --> 01:00:17,828
Oh, shit.

1009
01:00:20,132 --> 01:00:23,125
- Just tell my mom I love her, man.
- You tell her yourself.

1010
01:00:23,169 --> 01:00:25,763
- No, man.
- Pull it together.

1011
01:00:25,805 --> 01:00:28,639
Little Dave, you know that stunt
you've been yammering about?

1012
01:00:28,675 --> 01:00:30,906
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, now would be perfect.

1013
01:00:30,945 --> 01:00:32,412
Why now?

1014
01:00:34,582 --> 01:00:38,144
We dosed the whole school.
We need a distraction.

1015
01:00:39,755 --> 01:00:41,917
- That sounded weird.
- What?

1016
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:43,858
What?

1017
01:00:43,894 --> 01:00:46,261
Oh!

1018
01:00:56,643 --> 01:00:59,077
May I have your attention, please?

1019
01:00:59,112 --> 01:01:02,344
Witness the death-defying stunt

1020
01:01:02,383 --> 01:01:04,284
never before attempted.

1021
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:08,984
Little Dave Klein is gonna jump off
the library balcony

1022
01:01:09,025 --> 01:01:13,861
on his motherfuckir skateboard!

1023
01:01:13,897 --> 01:01:15,421
Yeah!

1024
01:01:18,336 --> 01:01:19,667
The balcony.

1025
01:01:22,373 --> 01:01:24,808
- Go for it, Dave.
- It's suicide!

1026
01:01:24,844 --> 01:01:26,334
- Let's check it out!
- Let's roll this shit.

1027
01:01:33,421 --> 01:01:36,185
Whoo!

1028
01:01:36,224 --> 01:01:37,692
Yeah!

1029
01:01:37,726 --> 01:01:39,785
Whoa! Oh!

1030
01:01:39,828 --> 01:01:42,354
Whoa! Yes!

1031
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,735
That was some
"Faces of Death" shit, homes.

1032
01:01:47,771 --> 01:01:50,899
- I can feel skin flapping.
- What?

1033
01:01:50,941 --> 01:01:53,570
Seriously, I think
I've ripped my sack, man.

1034
01:01:55,313 --> 01:01:57,248
I should have tenured at Stanford.

1035
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,708
Tameka?

1036
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:26,842
- Tameka!
- I'm sorry. There was an incident.

1037
01:02:26,885 --> 01:02:28,819
Here's your coffee.

1038
01:02:31,858 --> 01:02:34,623
- I'm so sorry?
- Thank you.

1039
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:37,261
Is there anything else, sir?

1040
01:02:37,298 --> 01:02:39,426
- The gas man is waiting...
- No, I'm finished.

1041
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:44,904
Actually, there is

1042
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:50,141
one small thing I'd like you
to take care of, Tameka.

1043
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:52,114
Oh, yes.

1044
01:02:52,149 --> 01:02:54,482
Yes, there is.

1045
01:03:00,259 --> 01:03:02,318
- The cops are coming.
- What?

1046
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:03,886
- They're on their way.
- The police?

1047
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:05,124
- Yes!
- No, t-tell them

1048
01:03:05,165 --> 01:03:06,996
- that's everything's under control.
- That's not gonna work.

1049
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:09,798
Oh, God damn it!
I'll be right there.

1050
01:03:16,946 --> 01:03:19,380
- Yeah!
- Live the moment! Live it!

1051
01:03:22,386 --> 01:03:24,616
Fuck.

1052
01:03:24,655 --> 01:03:27,318
I lost count.
Fuckir singles.

1053
01:03:29,861 --> 01:03:34,026
$2,403.

1054
01:03:34,066 --> 01:03:36,558
- That's a start.
- Wait, a start?

1055
01:03:36,603 --> 01:03:39,003
- You said if we got you the money...
- I said that it will buy you

1056
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:40,803
till the end of the day.

1057
01:03:42,176 --> 01:03:44,838
This shit ain't even remotely close
to the street value.

1058
01:03:44,879 --> 01:03:46,871
How much?

1059
01:03:51,588 --> 01:03:53,988
- 50.
- Thousand?

1060
01:03:54,024 --> 01:03:58,462
No, cents, stupid.
50 fucking thousand.

1061
01:03:58,496 --> 01:03:59,987
US.

1062
01:04:01,099 --> 01:04:04,797
Let's call it 49,
since I like you guys, huh?

1063
01:04:04,837 --> 01:04:08,000
You're both fuckir nuts. Huh?

1064
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:10,943
- I'll be waiting in the parking lot.
- So you're just leaving, then?

1065
01:04:10,978 --> 01:04:12,468
You don't see
what's going on here?

1066
01:04:12,513 --> 01:04:13,913
You don't see
what we're up against?

1067
01:04:13,948 --> 01:04:16,212
We could use a psychoism fiend
with a lot of green

1068
01:04:16,251 --> 01:04:17,741
and you're turning your back on us.

1069
01:04:17,786 --> 01:04:21,018
Go take care of yourself, Ed.

1070
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:22,354
Guess it's what you're best at.

1071
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:25,156
I'm not fucking around!

1072
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:27,425
The money or you're
both marked, man.

1073
01:04:31,002 --> 01:04:32,937
Weed legends or not.

1074
01:04:39,579 --> 01:04:41,740
We're live at the prestigious
Morgan High School

1075
01:04:41,781 --> 01:04:45,486
where a group of angry parents
are protesting the school's decision

1076
01:04:45,521 --> 01:04:47,478
- to drug test...
- Who are you?

1077
01:04:47,522 --> 01:04:50,514
- We're with Channel 5 News.
- That thing's on?

1078
01:04:52,028 --> 01:04:53,120
Yes, we're live right now.

1079
01:04:53,162 --> 01:04:55,426
What would you like to say
to Headmaster Gordon?

1080
01:04:55,465 --> 01:04:58,765
- Is he watching?
- If he were watching.

1081
01:04:59,837 --> 01:05:03,171
What do you mean "were"?
W- Was he watching?

1082
01:05:03,208 --> 01:05:05,734
- Is this the past?
- Cut the feed.

1083
01:05:05,778 --> 01:05:07,769
Is that that same school?

1084
01:05:07,813 --> 01:05:10,247
The gas company dude
says that it's not a gas leak.

1085
01:05:10,282 --> 01:05:12,843
We're checking the cafeteria
for salmonella.

1086
01:05:12,886 --> 01:05:16,050
I mean, what else could it be, huh?

1087
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:18,581
- Asbestos?
- Those are the wrong symptoms, okay?

1088
01:05:18,626 --> 01:05:20,857
This is... this is more psychological.

1089
01:05:20,896 --> 01:05:24,731
It's kind of like
God's eye watching itself.

1090
01:05:24,768 --> 01:05:25,962
Jesus!

1091
01:05:26,002 --> 01:05:28,971
Why is everyone acting
like a bunch of baboons?

1092
01:05:29,005 --> 01:05:31,304
Yeah, I don't know.

1093
01:05:31,342 --> 01:05:34,403
It's... it's nuts, but we're having

1094
01:05:34,446 --> 01:05:36,744
a choice brainstorming session
just like you asked.

1095
01:05:36,782 --> 01:05:40,014
No one leaves this place
until we identify this problem.

1096
01:05:40,052 --> 01:05:42,782
Think, people!
This thing is out of control!

1097
01:05:42,822 --> 01:05:45,257
We have to shut it down!

1098
01:05:46,894 --> 01:05:49,159
What? Hey.

1099
01:05:53,769 --> 01:05:55,669
Just think, you did that.

1100
01:05:55,704 --> 01:05:57,535
How's that for an accomplishment?

1101
01:05:57,573 --> 01:05:59,235
Right?

1102
01:05:59,276 --> 01:06:00,766
Oh, come on.

1103
01:06:00,811 --> 01:06:02,780
Look, it's not like he's
irreparably damaged or anything.

1104
01:06:02,814 --> 01:06:03,838
- Leave me alone, Breaux.
- He's gonna be fine.

1105
01:06:03,881 --> 01:06:05,849
I am sick of your
pathological optimism.

1106
01:06:05,883 --> 01:06:08,409
My life is in the shit-house
because of you.

1107
01:06:08,453 --> 01:06:09,943
I didn't put a gat to your dome.

1108
01:06:09,988 --> 01:06:13,152
You smoked that fatty.
You puffed down. You got high.

1109
01:06:13,193 --> 01:06:15,821
You got you into this,
you judgmental hypocrite.

1110
01:06:15,862 --> 01:06:18,058
And to think I did all this bullshit
to try and help you.

1111
01:06:18,098 --> 01:06:20,066
I never had a single thing
to lose, dumbass.

1112
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:21,591
Yeah, man, you don't need to tell me
you didn't have anything to lose.

1113
01:06:21,636 --> 01:06:23,399
Everybody knows that.

1114
01:06:26,909 --> 01:06:28,467
You know why we stopped
being homies, Henry?

1115
01:06:28,511 --> 01:06:30,946
Come on, man.

1116
01:06:30,981 --> 01:06:33,142
It's when your dad left your mom.

1117
01:06:33,183 --> 01:06:35,583
And that puts you
in the same place as me.

1118
01:06:35,619 --> 01:06:36,917
And having that thought
in your skull

1119
01:06:36,955 --> 01:06:38,923
scared the shit
out of you, didn't it?

1120
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:42,283
That suddenly your life
could be anything like mine.

1121
01:06:42,328 --> 01:06:45,058
- That's not true, man.
- Fuck you.

1122
01:06:46,066 --> 01:06:48,159
You don't believe that truth,
then fuck you.

1123
01:06:49,336 --> 01:06:52,363
Go ahead, give up,
because I'm not done yet.

1124
01:06:52,406 --> 01:06:54,705
But I am sick and tired
of your candy-ass whining

1125
01:06:54,743 --> 01:06:57,109
when fuckir one door
separates us from that footage.

1126
01:06:57,145 --> 01:06:59,136
- And you can't...
- Man, even if we could get in there...

1127
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:00,672
I mean, even if we could
destroy the footage...

1128
01:07:00,717 --> 01:07:02,184
I mean,
what about Psycho Ed?

1129
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:04,049
Man, where are we
gonna get $50,000?

1130
01:07:04,088 --> 01:07:07,854
Who is Psycho Ed?

1131
01:07:07,892 --> 01:07:10,885
Suck my wispy left nut, Sebastian.
You don't know shit.

1132
01:07:10,929 --> 01:07:12,658
Uh uh uh.

1133
01:07:12,697 --> 01:07:16,395
I know that you two
got the student body

1134
01:07:16,435 --> 01:07:20,133
and the faculty high
on marijuana brownies,

1135
01:07:20,173 --> 01:07:23,803
all because you didn't wanna risk
screwing up your finals

1136
01:07:23,845 --> 01:07:26,939
and losing valedictorian to me.

1137
01:07:26,981 --> 01:07:29,280
And I know that
five minutes from now,

1138
01:07:29,318 --> 01:07:30,945
Dr. Gordon will know
as much himself.

1139
01:07:30,986 --> 01:07:31,975
If you say a word to anybody,

1140
01:07:32,021 --> 01:07:33,455
there's gonna be an 18-7
up in this bitch.

1141
01:07:33,490 --> 01:07:34,479
You feel me?

1142
01:07:34,524 --> 01:07:36,583
- Ah! Okay, okay. Ow!
- What do you want, Sebastian?

1143
01:07:36,626 --> 01:07:39,391
- Ow. Okay, okay. Fuck!
- What should have been mine.

1144
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:42,025
And once you're exposed,

1145
01:07:42,067 --> 01:07:44,399
- I'll have it.
- Okay. Ow! Ow!

1146
01:07:44,436 --> 01:07:46,427
Sebastian, I'll throw
my English final.

1147
01:07:48,074 --> 01:07:50,668
If I fail it, you're valedictorian.

1148
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:52,906
When you're expelled,

1149
01:07:52,947 --> 01:07:55,677
I'm valedictorian anyway, asshole.

1150
01:07:55,716 --> 01:07:58,379
By default.

1151
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:01,447
But if I fail, you win
by beating my GPA,

1152
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:03,685
by earning it in the eyes
of everyone else.

1153
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:08,321
Fine.

1154
01:08:08,365 --> 01:08:11,995
If you fail, Henry,
my lips are sealed.

1155
01:08:15,374 --> 01:08:17,672
Yes!

1156
01:08:20,747 --> 01:08:23,443
Do you people even realize

1157
01:08:23,483 --> 01:08:26,510
the significance
of the Boston Tea Party?

1158
01:08:26,554 --> 01:08:28,715
I mean, think about it...
it was tea.

1159
01:08:30,192 --> 01:08:32,422
A mere beverage.

1160
01:08:32,461 --> 01:08:36,057
It's like the beverage
gave the oppressed people...

1161
01:08:38,501 --> 01:08:40,470
leverage.

1162
01:08:40,504 --> 01:08:41,869
Beverage.

1163
01:08:41,905 --> 01:08:45,933
- Say it with me, come on. Beverage.
- Class: Beverage.

1164
01:08:45,977 --> 01:08:49,812
Be-ver-age, you know...

1165
01:08:49,849 --> 01:08:52,647
Lick it real slowly, like...

1166
01:08:52,685 --> 01:08:54,916
like it was the nipple,

1167
01:08:54,955 --> 01:08:56,855
- the teat of your own mother.
- Beverage.

1168
01:08:56,890 --> 01:08:58,381
Beverage.

1169
01:08:58,426 --> 01:09:00,792
Ooh!

1170
01:09:00,828 --> 01:09:04,890
A sort of lurid chill goes
up and down my spine.

1171
01:09:04,933 --> 01:09:07,128
Don't stop!
Please, don't stop!

1172
01:09:07,169 --> 01:09:14,600
Beverage. Beverage.

1173
01:09:14,645 --> 01:09:16,738
Beverage.

1174
01:09:16,782 --> 01:09:20,741
Excuse me.
Is there a Mr. Henry Burke?

1175
01:09:23,723 --> 01:09:26,284
You haven't visited us yet,
Mr. Burke.

1176
01:09:26,326 --> 01:09:29,420
Can I borrow him
for five minutes, please?

1177
01:09:29,463 --> 01:09:31,455
Say beverage.

1178
01:09:31,499 --> 01:09:35,162
Nice and slow.

1179
01:09:35,203 --> 01:09:37,604
- Beverage.
- What the shit?

1180
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:40,474
- Beverage.
- Beverage, that's it.

1181
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:44,105
Beverage. Beverage.

1182
01:09:45,115 --> 01:09:46,845
Thanks.

1183
01:09:54,727 --> 01:09:56,718
All right, turn around.
Arms up.

1184
01:09:59,934 --> 01:10:01,959
Any needles?
Sharp objects?

1185
01:10:02,002 --> 01:10:03,970
- All right.
- What's this right here?

1186
01:10:04,004 --> 01:10:06,974
Oh, it's your penis.

1187
01:10:07,008 --> 01:10:08,839
Sorry about that.

1188
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:18,188
Where have I felt this before?

1189
01:10:18,222 --> 01:10:21,454
Campus Stadium,
best Dead concert ever.

1190
01:10:21,493 --> 01:10:24,759
I toasted one just before
they opened with "US Blues."

1191
01:10:24,797 --> 01:10:26,287
You were there, too?

1192
01:10:26,332 --> 01:10:28,460
You remember when we heard
that it was gonna rain?

1193
01:10:28,502 --> 01:10:32,063
And everybody joined hands,
young and old,

1194
01:10:32,105 --> 01:10:35,803
- and we sang that rain away.
- We just sang it away.

1195
01:10:37,412 --> 01:10:39,312
Fuck me.

1196
01:10:39,348 --> 01:10:41,077
Whoa.

1197
01:10:41,116 --> 01:10:45,850
We are all buttstonked.

1198
01:10:45,889 --> 01:10:47,790
Nuh-uh.

1199
01:10:47,825 --> 01:10:50,658
The sticky green.

1200
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:55,661
The cannabis sativa.

1201
01:10:56,903 --> 01:11:00,498
The sinsemilla!

1202
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:04,807
But how does someone
get the entire school roasted?

1203
01:11:06,214 --> 01:11:09,012
Oh, I... I got it, I got it.

1204
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:11,042
I got it.

1205
01:11:12,388 --> 01:11:15,050
No, I lost it.
I lost it.

1206
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:18,424
I lost it.

1207
01:11:18,461 --> 01:11:20,453
I had it.

1208
01:11:20,498 --> 01:11:22,591
You're useless.

1209
01:11:29,274 --> 01:11:32,767
Wait, wait. Welcome back.

1210
01:11:32,812 --> 01:11:36,681
- Woman: Oh, heart.
- Holy shit, that scared me.

1211
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:40,717
Tameka, it's Brandon!

1212
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:42,586
Quarantine the brownies

1213
01:11:42,624 --> 01:11:45,287
and send one away
to get tested, okay?

1214
01:11:45,328 --> 01:11:49,288
Okay. Oh, and bring me
a box of Cheez-lts.

1215
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:51,096
All right, thanks.

1216
01:11:52,302 --> 01:11:56,034
Hey, Brandon,
how does a brownie take a test?

1217
01:12:10,157 --> 01:12:12,786
Attention.

1218
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:15,194
Can you hear me?

1219
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:18,928
Hello, this is Brandon.

1220
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:22,700
Um, all uneaten brownies
need to be brought

1221
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:24,298
to the administration offices.

1222
01:12:25,309 --> 01:12:26,800
Oh, no.

1223
01:12:26,845 --> 01:12:27,937
They have been contaminated,

1224
01:12:27,979 --> 01:12:30,140
so, please, don't eat them.

1225
01:12:30,181 --> 01:12:32,343
Please?

1226
01:12:32,385 --> 01:12:34,046
Don't... don't.

1227
01:12:34,086 --> 01:12:37,716
There is no need to panic.

1228
01:12:37,758 --> 01:12:41,160
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1229
01:12:41,195 --> 01:12:43,129
Okay?

1230
01:12:44,866 --> 01:12:47,597
Everything is rad.

1231
01:13:10,798 --> 01:13:13,562
Mr. Burke, first time late,

1232
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,535
ever.

1233
01:13:20,242 --> 01:13:24,179
Ah, well, it appears
you've all had a pleasant lunch.

1234
01:13:24,214 --> 01:13:27,274
- The salmon was boss.
- And the brownies were to die for.

1235
01:13:27,317 --> 01:13:30,253
So moist, so delicious.

1236
01:13:30,288 --> 01:13:32,518
Oh, my.

1237
01:13:32,557 --> 01:13:34,150
Shit.

1238
01:13:34,193 --> 01:13:36,821
This is a private meeting room.

1239
01:13:36,862 --> 01:13:40,128
You're fuckir with me.
Arert you?

1240
01:13:41,134 --> 01:13:42,625
I'm...

1241
01:13:47,442 --> 01:13:50,502
I just... I didn't
expect it to be so sad.

1242
01:13:53,883 --> 01:13:56,876
All those books,
all that fire, I...

1243
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:59,411
- Are you done with that?
- Oh, yeah, go for it.

1244
01:14:02,827 --> 01:14:05,796
- Clean yourself up, Miss Tombs.
- Fuck you.

1245
01:14:05,831 --> 01:14:07,765
Oh, my God.

1246
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,234
Dr. Gordon?

1247
01:14:10,269 --> 01:14:12,864
Brandon wanted me to tell you
that all the marijuana brownies

1248
01:14:12,906 --> 01:14:14,703
have been quarantined.

1249
01:14:15,710 --> 01:14:18,270
Um, what does she mean?

1250
01:14:22,151 --> 01:14:25,553
Um, there's been an incident,

1251
01:14:25,588 --> 01:14:27,180
but everything's
under control, I assure...

1252
01:14:27,223 --> 01:14:28,918
The brownies we just ate?

1253
01:14:28,958 --> 01:14:33,794
They were more than likely,

1254
01:14:33,831 --> 01:14:38,496
uh, tainted with, ahem,

1255
01:14:38,537 --> 01:14:40,335
marijuana.

1256
01:14:44,478 --> 01:14:48,039
Yes, I... I think you're right.
Do you all feel that?

1257
01:14:48,081 --> 01:14:50,175
It's kind of like my soul

1258
01:14:50,218 --> 01:14:52,584
were swimming
within my own flesh.

1259
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:54,851
It's rousing.

1260
01:14:56,192 --> 01:14:58,991
I think I just came.

1261
01:14:59,029 --> 01:15:01,896
Next up... Mr. Burke.

1262
01:15:25,527 --> 01:15:29,396
Um, "To be or not to be"...

1263
01:15:29,432 --> 01:15:31,958
Shakespeare's great question
to his character Hamlet,

1264
01:15:32,002 --> 01:15:35,335
his great challenge
to his audience in 1600

1265
01:15:35,372 --> 01:15:38,638
and today,
over 400 years later.

1266
01:15:44,783 --> 01:15:47,252
Hamlet, huh?

1267
01:15:47,287 --> 01:15:49,312
What a fuckir pussy.

1268
01:15:49,356 --> 01:15:50,881
I mean, I didn't even read it.

1269
01:15:50,925 --> 01:15:54,292
I just Netflixed the DVD with
that "Mad Max" douche-bag in it,

1270
01:15:54,328 --> 01:15:57,765
but his uncle
iced his father, right?

1271
01:15:57,799 --> 01:16:00,735
Popped an 18-7 up in that motherfucker
and he's talking to ghosts and shit?

1272
01:16:00,770 --> 01:16:02,965
All like, "Daddy, Daddy,
what am I gonna do?

1273
01:16:03,006 --> 01:16:04,030
What am I gonna do?"

1274
01:16:04,073 --> 01:16:06,736
I mean, bitch, grow a pair
of clackers and snap out of it.

1275
01:16:06,777 --> 01:16:08,711
I mean, clearly this dude
needs some help.

1276
01:16:10,949 --> 01:16:13,713
Sad thing is

1277
01:16:13,752 --> 01:16:17,120
every time I think about Hamlet,
I think about myself...

1278
01:16:18,926 --> 01:16:24,763
too... too cautious, too deliberate,
planned perfection.

1279
01:16:24,799 --> 01:16:26,733
I'm reaching
for the unreachable,

1280
01:16:26,768 --> 01:16:29,704
something that, quite honestly,
I don't think is there.

1281
01:16:29,738 --> 01:16:32,298
And I get caught up in the bullshit
of trying to be perfect.

1282
01:16:32,341 --> 01:16:35,641
I forget about
what's right in front of me,

1283
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:39,343
like the... like the other
aspects of my life.

1284
01:16:41,619 --> 01:16:45,784
My mom's gonna love me
whether or not I go to MIT.

1285
01:16:45,824 --> 01:16:48,350
And, you know,
being valedictorian

1286
01:16:48,394 --> 01:16:49,884
is not that big a deal, really.

1287
01:16:49,929 --> 01:16:51,693
I mean, it may seem
important now,

1288
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:53,529
but in 10 years, you know,
that's just gonna be shit

1289
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:55,535
that made me miss
the other moments,

1290
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:59,472
the stuff I wanted to do

1291
01:16:59,507 --> 01:17:02,705
but I talked myself out of,

1292
01:17:02,745 --> 01:17:06,477
stuff my heart wants
but logic would trip over

1293
01:17:06,516 --> 01:17:11,648
like grabbing life by the balls

1294
01:17:11,689 --> 01:17:14,317
and going after the girl
I always thought was hot.

1295
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:20,863
She's too hot for me.

1296
01:17:23,169 --> 01:17:25,161
So what's the point?

1297
01:17:27,108 --> 01:17:31,102
When you want
so hard for it to be

1298
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:33,944
and it's just not to be,

1299
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:35,974
there's nothing
you can do about it.

1300
01:17:43,661 --> 01:17:46,426
Uh, so anyway...

1301
01:17:48,934 --> 01:17:52,597
Hamlet's a punk-ass bitch
and Shakespeare's massively overrated.

1302
01:17:58,413 --> 01:18:00,108
Oh, shit.

1303
01:18:10,427 --> 01:18:11,655
Oh, fuck.

1304
01:18:19,337 --> 01:18:21,532
Yo, Henry.

1305
01:18:27,448 --> 01:18:29,916
I'll go out with you, dude.

1306
01:18:32,353 --> 01:18:33,843
Yeah.

1307
01:18:35,557 --> 01:18:38,721
Okay. Well, that's all
I wanted to say.

1308
01:18:38,761 --> 01:18:41,925
# There's a lot of lies #

1309
01:18:41,965 --> 01:18:46,596
# I'd like to get out of my head... #

1310
01:18:48,773 --> 01:18:50,537
Jesus.

1311
01:18:51,844 --> 01:18:54,278
You're not sayir that because
you're high as fuck right now, right?

1312
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:56,942
High as fuck right now?

1313
01:18:56,983 --> 01:18:58,917
# Out of my head... #

1314
01:18:58,952 --> 01:19:02,582
- We all are.
- # Out of my head... #

1315
01:19:09,465 --> 01:19:11,865
# Out of my head. #

1316
01:19:11,901 --> 01:19:15,633
Hey, I thought we had a deal.

1317
01:19:18,041 --> 01:19:19,475
You know what?

1318
01:19:19,511 --> 01:19:22,309
You can go fuck yourself,
you warped piece of shit.

1319
01:19:25,217 --> 01:19:27,378
Bravo, Henry.

1320
01:19:34,529 --> 01:19:37,396
Salutatoriars
a pretty big deal, too.

1321
01:19:41,103 --> 01:19:42,799
Tameka, have Brandon pull up

1322
01:19:42,839 --> 01:19:45,388
the surveillance footage
from the gym this morning

1323
01:19:45,423 --> 01:19:47,938
and summon Travis Breaux
and Henry Burke to my office.

1324
01:19:47,978 --> 01:19:50,469
Oh, and put on a fresh pot of coffee.

1325
01:19:58,925 --> 01:20:01,827
- Ahh.
- Right away, Dr. Gordon, but...

1326
01:20:01,862 --> 01:20:03,853
No buts, Tameka.

1327
01:20:03,897 --> 01:20:08,392
Except yours
in my face, you fuckir...

1328
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:15,434
It's just that Travis Breaux
is already here to see you, sir.

1329
01:20:35,236 --> 01:20:37,796
# I know you're livir life
in a hurry #

1330
01:20:37,838 --> 01:20:41,400
# So afraid to take it slow,
'cause reality is scary... #

1331
01:20:41,443 --> 01:20:42,705
Henry Burke,

1332
01:20:42,744 --> 01:20:44,906
please report
to the administration office.

1333
01:20:46,649 --> 01:20:50,108
Henry Burke, please report
to the administration office.

1334
01:20:50,153 --> 01:20:52,451
Shit!

1335
01:20:52,489 --> 01:20:55,220
Where the fuck
is the administration office, man?

1336
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:59,698
# Ooh, oh, how the hell
did shit get so real? #

1337
01:20:59,732 --> 01:21:02,633
# It's hard for me to deal #

1338
01:21:02,668 --> 01:21:07,436
# Sometimes I just sit and think,
I thought it would be... #

1339
01:21:07,474 --> 01:21:11,502
I've never felt so good in my life!
It feels so good!

1340
01:21:13,181 --> 01:21:15,308
It feels so good

1341
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:17,683
to be alive

1342
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:20,951
and an assistant dean!

1343
01:21:20,990 --> 01:21:23,926
# I swear I never felt so alive... #

1344
01:21:23,961 --> 01:21:28,160
Sunshine! Oh!

1345
01:21:31,169 --> 01:21:33,263
- Talk to me, Goose.
- Goose?

1346
01:21:33,306 --> 01:21:36,105
- It's me. I've got the video up.
- Bitchir.

1347
01:21:36,143 --> 01:21:37,906
So I'm just gonna burn a copy
and bring it up

1348
01:21:37,945 --> 01:21:39,276
to Dr. Gordors office, then.

1349
01:21:39,313 --> 01:21:42,249
No, wait... no.
No, no, no.

1350
01:21:42,283 --> 01:21:44,274
Make a copy, don't burn it.

1351
01:21:44,319 --> 01:21:46,880
Make a copy and then bring it
to Dr. Gordors office.

1352
01:21:46,922 --> 01:21:49,948
Don't burn it. Idiot.

1353
01:21:49,992 --> 01:21:52,393
Henry Burke, please report

1354
01:21:52,429 --> 01:21:53,919
to the administration office
immediately.

1355
01:21:53,964 --> 01:21:57,093
- Aw, shit!
- Busted.

1356
01:21:57,134 --> 01:21:59,625
- What do we do?
- Hide the rest of the evidence.

1357
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:01,195
Where did we leave it?

1358
01:22:09,717 --> 01:22:13,209
Tameka: "Tameka.
Oh, Tameka, I need my coffee.

1359
01:22:13,253 --> 01:22:14,482
Black, extra sugar."

1360
01:22:14,522 --> 01:22:16,888
Choke on it, motherfucker.

1361
01:22:37,316 --> 01:22:39,717
Just set it down.

1362
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:52,592
My lord,
that's fucking good coffee.

1363
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:59,402
Big day for you,
Mr. Breaux? Yes?

1364
01:23:00,811 --> 01:23:02,871
Yes.

1365
01:23:05,884 --> 01:23:07,648
Fuck!

1366
01:23:14,027 --> 01:23:16,258
Girls: Whoa! Hey!

1367
01:23:19,567 --> 01:23:21,934
Just so you know,
I have surveillance footage

1368
01:23:21,970 --> 01:23:24,302
being brought over here right now,

1369
01:23:24,339 --> 01:23:28,003
footage that caught you and all
your demonic acts in plain view...

1370
01:23:28,044 --> 01:23:31,208
you and our valedictorian,
Mr. Burke.

1371
01:23:33,084 --> 01:23:35,144
Henry has nothing to do with this.

1372
01:23:35,187 --> 01:23:38,281
So, you admit that you did?

1373
01:23:44,331 --> 01:23:47,164
Normally, discipline
is a passive exercise for me.

1374
01:23:47,201 --> 01:23:49,830
On rare occasion
I do relish it.

1375
01:23:49,871 --> 01:23:53,433
I must admit that
when you go down, and...

1376
01:23:55,010 --> 01:23:57,672
Believe me, you will
go down hard for this,

1377
01:23:57,713 --> 01:23:59,978
I will consider it
one of the highlights

1378
01:24:00,016 --> 01:24:04,511
of my career... nay, my life.

1379
01:24:11,864 --> 01:24:14,333
Oh, no, helicopters.

1380
01:24:24,846 --> 01:24:26,712
What? What is he doing?

1381
01:24:26,749 --> 01:24:28,216
What's wrong with that kid?

1382
01:24:28,251 --> 01:24:30,515
I'll admit I'm no gem
of a student,

1383
01:24:30,553 --> 01:24:33,182
and for whatever stress I've put
my teachers through over the years,

1384
01:24:33,223 --> 01:24:36,421
I'm genuinely sorry,
but there's something worse

1385
01:24:36,461 --> 01:24:39,521
than a kid who breaks the rules,
fucks around, tokes down

1386
01:24:39,564 --> 01:24:43,763
on a bit of hakeem marijuolajuwon
now and again.

1387
01:24:43,802 --> 01:24:47,000
A middle-aged pimp
who pretends to be the judge

1388
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,167
of all that is right
and good in the world.

1389
01:24:49,209 --> 01:24:51,075
What happened to you?

1390
01:24:51,112 --> 01:24:53,205
Did you fail miserably
somewhere along the lines

1391
01:24:53,247 --> 01:24:55,580
as a husband?
A parent?

1392
01:24:55,617 --> 01:24:57,141
You think that if you purify

1393
01:24:57,186 --> 01:24:59,849
your Morgan High
Kingdom of Nastiness,

1394
01:24:59,889 --> 01:25:01,186
you somehow purify yourself?

1395
01:25:01,224 --> 01:25:02,748
Is that it?

1396
01:25:06,130 --> 01:25:08,291
Well, the answer is...

1397
01:25:10,468 --> 01:25:11,958
no.

1398
01:25:19,813 --> 01:25:22,441
What the shit?!
What are you doing?

1399
01:25:22,482 --> 01:25:24,246
Get... get out of the van!

1400
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:27,482
- What?
- Get out of my fuckir van!

1401
01:25:27,522 --> 01:25:29,548
You broke the law,

1402
01:25:29,592 --> 01:25:31,992
you dosed the entire faculty
and student body

1403
01:25:32,027 --> 01:25:34,019
with hazardous amounts of THC,

1404
01:25:34,064 --> 01:25:38,297
and you are going
to jail, Breaux,

1405
01:25:38,336 --> 01:25:40,600
where you belong.

1406
01:25:40,638 --> 01:25:42,766
Oh, hell...

1407
01:25:42,808 --> 01:25:45,675
What the shit?
You get the fuck out of my van!

1408
01:25:50,383 --> 01:25:52,147
Whoa! Fuck!

1409
01:25:52,186 --> 01:25:54,347
Oh, fuck! Oh!

1410
01:26:01,964 --> 01:26:04,762
Oh, piss is on me!

1411
01:26:10,507 --> 01:26:13,477
My God, he is good.

1412
01:26:14,946 --> 01:26:17,541
Checkmate, Navaline.

1413
01:26:17,583 --> 01:26:20,074
Checkmate.

1414
01:26:21,288 --> 01:26:24,223
You should see
your face right now.

1415
01:26:24,257 --> 01:26:27,455
You look like my cat,

1416
01:26:27,495 --> 01:26:30,397
Dolly,

1417
01:26:30,432 --> 01:26:36,167
just as we pierced her abscess
sans nitrous oxide.

1418
01:26:36,205 --> 01:26:38,639
You prick.

1419
01:26:51,624 --> 01:26:53,559
Tick, tick, tick.

1420
01:27:13,284 --> 01:27:15,343
Are the police here,
God damn it?

1421
01:27:15,386 --> 01:27:17,378
They're on their way.

1422
01:27:20,859 --> 01:27:23,693
Time seems to be moving
very slowly.

1423
01:27:25,932 --> 01:27:28,299
Jesus fucking Christ.

1424
01:27:31,573 --> 01:27:35,031
Aw, hell, no.

1425
01:27:35,076 --> 01:27:37,272
- What?
- What?

1426
01:27:37,313 --> 01:27:41,878
- What?
- What?

1427
01:27:46,991 --> 01:27:48,219
Dr. Gordon:
Wha...

1428
01:28:14,391 --> 01:28:16,951
Tameka, have any more
of that coffee?

1429
01:28:16,994 --> 01:28:19,520
Oh, yeah, I should score
some of that.

1430
01:28:19,564 --> 01:28:21,555
You already drank
all the coffee, sir.

1431
01:28:21,599 --> 01:28:23,260
Damn!

1432
01:28:23,301 --> 01:28:26,703
- Going to a Huey Lewis concert?
- Why? Is he on tour again?

1433
01:28:26,739 --> 01:28:28,206
Entrez-vous.

1434
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:30,209
Sorry about the delay.

1435
01:28:30,243 --> 01:28:32,643
Something weird happened
to the ray drive.

1436
01:28:32,679 --> 01:28:34,978
Luckily, though, I was able
to make a back-up

1437
01:28:35,016 --> 01:28:36,643
before everything crashed.

1438
01:28:36,684 --> 01:28:39,848
Perfect.
Go on, show it to us.

1439
01:28:39,888 --> 01:28:42,356
If a picture is won'th 1,000 words,

1440
01:28:42,391 --> 01:28:46,829
then this footage should be
won'th 1,000 pictures,

1441
01:28:46,863 --> 01:28:51,665
which would equal
a million... words.

1442
01:28:53,572 --> 01:28:57,373
Uh, Tameka,
bring the Johnson file.

1443
01:28:57,410 --> 01:29:00,675
- Wait, this isn't...
- Dr. Gordon on TV: Shut the door.

1444
01:29:10,058 --> 01:29:13,153
- Where would you like it?
- The filing cabinet, please.

1445
01:29:13,195 --> 01:29:16,757
- Malcolm, what's going on around here?
- I'll show you where I'd like it.

1446
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,633
- What is... what... stop it!
- Sweetie, it's all right.

1447
01:29:19,669 --> 01:29:22,833
Dr. Gordon, get off!
That's my underwear, Dr. Gordon.

1448
01:29:22,874 --> 01:29:25,537
- What are you doing?
- Stupid elastic. God damn it.

1449
01:29:25,577 --> 01:29:27,670
- Get... get off of me!
- Daddy wants some chocolate!

1450
01:29:27,713 --> 01:29:29,909
Motherfucker,
this ain't "Monster's Ball!"

1451
01:29:29,949 --> 01:29:32,850
- Dr. Gordon, get off! Get off!
- Talk to me, baby!

1452
01:29:32,886 --> 01:29:35,981
I don't understand the... I...

1453
01:29:36,023 --> 01:29:38,617
- This is preposterous!
- Back up!

1454
01:29:38,659 --> 01:29:40,719
You want your nuts stapled together?
Is that what you want?

1455
01:29:40,762 --> 01:29:42,525
- No, no.
- What is wrong with you? What the fuck?

1456
01:29:42,564 --> 01:29:45,090
- I'm... I'm...
- Motherfucker, you ain't Billy Bob

1457
01:29:45,134 --> 01:29:46,601
- just 'cause you have a porn stash.
- What?

1458
01:29:46,636 --> 01:29:49,663
- Never do that... never do that again.
- I promise I won't, Tameka.

1459
01:29:49,706 --> 01:29:51,799
You don't understand.
My wife has crabs.

1460
01:29:51,842 --> 01:29:53,572
- Ooh.
- I can't help it. I'm...

1461
01:29:53,611 --> 01:29:55,738
You two, you can go now.

1462
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:58,078
Wait! I've still got your piss.

1463
01:29:58,116 --> 01:30:00,312
I've got your pissss.

1464
01:30:00,352 --> 01:30:03,049
If there's so much
as an errant molecule,

1465
01:30:03,089 --> 01:30:06,456
you will have to spend
the rest of your lives

1466
01:30:06,493 --> 01:30:09,554
sans a high school diploma.

1467
01:30:09,597 --> 01:30:13,034
That's assuming
inculpatory facts not in evidence.

1468
01:30:13,068 --> 01:30:15,332
Reveal your identity, sir.

1469
01:30:15,370 --> 01:30:17,601
- Shit, it's a trap.
- What?

1470
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:19,608
The police put a transmitter
in my teeth.

1471
01:30:19,642 --> 01:30:22,305
I'm Edward Esquire,
cheese-dick.

1472
01:30:22,346 --> 01:30:26,248
And it violates
"Katz v United States," 1964,

1473
01:30:26,283 --> 01:30:27,876
when the Supreme Court
set the standards

1474
01:30:27,919 --> 01:30:29,648
for reasonable
expectations of privacy.

1475
01:30:29,688 --> 01:30:34,888
Certainly, one could argue
that piss is highly private.

1476
01:30:36,396 --> 01:30:38,557
Furthermore,
any statements by you

1477
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:40,624
regarding these
two little assholes

1478
01:30:40,667 --> 01:30:43,228
won't stand up
in court because

1479
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:47,072
you're blind off your gourd on
really high-caliber mari-hoo-hoo, bro.

1480
01:30:48,978 --> 01:30:50,947
Drug test his ass, man.

1481
01:30:50,981 --> 01:30:53,006
Would you agree to submit
to a drug test, sir?

1482
01:30:53,049 --> 01:30:54,539
- L...
- For the record,

1483
01:30:54,584 --> 01:30:56,815
he made it very clear
he didn't have any of the brownies.

1484
01:30:56,854 --> 01:30:59,448
Wha... honey-pie.

1485
01:30:59,490 --> 01:31:02,756
Would you agree
to kiss my hairy sack?

1486
01:31:02,794 --> 01:31:05,821
If you wanna sue this prick
for workplace sexual harassment

1487
01:31:05,865 --> 01:31:08,891
or, uh, score a chronic
sack of doobies,

1488
01:31:08,935 --> 01:31:11,564
just, you know, page me.

1489
01:31:11,605 --> 01:31:15,337
Uh, Mr. Esquire?
Can I have a card?

1490
01:31:17,412 --> 01:31:19,040
Did he molest you, too?

1491
01:31:19,081 --> 01:31:21,845
- In my mind.
- That's nasty, dude.

1492
01:31:25,489 --> 01:31:27,013
Thanks.

1493
01:31:41,508 --> 01:31:43,670
Dr. Gordon, what do you have
to say to the parents outside?

1494
01:31:43,711 --> 01:31:46,839
My... my balls feel all tingly.

1495
01:31:46,881 --> 01:31:50,079
Hi, son.

1496
01:31:50,118 --> 01:31:52,417
- Hi.
- Fuck you.

1497
01:31:52,455 --> 01:31:54,389
Oh, how pleasant.

1498
01:31:54,424 --> 01:31:56,358
10-4. Principal is in custody,
transporting back to station.

1499
01:32:08,808 --> 01:32:10,742
Take it easy!

1500
01:32:10,776 --> 01:32:12,472
Oh, I don't like that.

1501
01:32:12,512 --> 01:32:16,643
My colon.
Oh, my spastic colon!

1502
01:32:18,753 --> 01:32:21,154
Hey, you bastards!

1503
01:33:06,611 --> 01:33:11,015
We should, uh, you know,
kick it again sometime.

1504
01:33:11,049 --> 01:33:13,746
Come on, man.

1505
01:33:13,787 --> 01:33:15,448
- Be somebody.
- Oh.

1506
01:33:19,326 --> 01:33:20,759
Be somebody.

1507
01:33:20,795 --> 01:33:22,286
- Yeah, that's what I said.
- No, no.

1508
01:33:22,330 --> 01:33:23,854
- Be somebody.
- Be somebody.

1509
01:33:23,899 --> 01:33:25,992
- Be somebody.
- Got to... got to be somebody.

1510
01:33:26,034 --> 01:33:27,400
Twing, twing.

1511
01:33:27,436 --> 01:33:28,767
Weed done finally kicked in, man.

1512
01:33:28,805 --> 01:33:30,898
Yo, that's some
four-dimensional shit.

1513
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:34,172
Where the fuck
is the administration office?

1514
01:33:34,211 --> 01:33:36,510
Are you fucking with me?

1515
01:33:36,548 --> 01:33:38,449
- What?
- What?

1516
01:39:13,222 --> 01:39:16,419
Beverage, beverage.

1517
01:39:16,458 --> 01:39:20,293
Beverage, beverage.

1518
01:39:23,167 --> 01:39:25,829
Class dismissed.

1519
01:39:29,307 --> 01:39:32,903
Cut.
