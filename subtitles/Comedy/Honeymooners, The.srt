Taxi!


15
00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:30,293
Can I give you a ride?

16
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:32,047
The way you drive?

17
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:16,005
So how you doing?

18
00:03:17,454 --> 00:03:18,967
You sure got a lot of confidence.

19
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:23,247
Ralph. Ralph Kramden.

20
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,531
Operator of this machine...

21
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,853
...and this machine.

22
00:03:30,734 --> 00:03:33,043
Alice. Alice Gibson.

23
00:03:33,294 --> 00:03:35,171
What's up, Alice Gibson?

24
00:03:37,854 --> 00:03:40,084
So, Ralph Kramden, are you
taking me to Brooklyn or what?

25
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:44,247
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go.
Crown Heights, Red Hook, Bushwick.

26
00:03:44,494 --> 00:03:47,008
I'll take you to the moon, Alice.
Come on.

27
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:54,450
I hope you're not gonna lose
your job over this.

28
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:55,609
So what if I do?

29
00:03:55,854 --> 00:03:58,687
I mean, this right here, this whole
bus-driver thing, this is temporary.

30
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:01,528
I'm an entrepreneur,

31
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,083
and this is gonna make me
a millionaire.

32
00:04:07,854 --> 00:04:11,563
Yeah. And when Y2K hit,
you gonna need all that stuff in there.

33
00:04:11,814 --> 00:04:14,772
- You think Y2K is gonna be that bad?
- You ain't been watching CNN?

34
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:19,088
When every computer in the world
shuts down on New Year's Eve,

35
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:22,246
that kit, plus a check
or money order for 29.99,

36
00:04:22,494 --> 00:04:23,529
plus shipping and handling,

37
00:04:23,774 --> 00:04:26,686
is the only thing that's gonna protect
you against total chaos.

38
00:04:27,374 --> 00:04:30,969
- Wow, total chaos?
- Yeah. I mean, you know, if I'm lucky.

39
00:04:31,214 --> 00:04:33,774
I guess my dream's
a little bit more practical.

40
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,365
Oh, yeah? Like what?

41
00:04:36,614 --> 00:04:38,047
My own home.

42
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:41,445
You know, nothing fancy.
Just a little place all my own.

43
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:42,769
You know?

44
00:04:43,014 --> 00:04:47,212
No landlord or haggling with the super
to fix the pipes or rent increases.

45
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,773
Just...

46
00:04:49,094 --> 00:04:52,404
...my name on a deed and, well,
some lawn chairs on the front porch

47
00:04:52,654 --> 00:04:54,849
so I can watch my kids
play ball in the street.

48
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,447
You got kids?

49
00:04:58,694 --> 00:05:00,173
I'm playing.

50
00:05:01,694 --> 00:05:03,685
Can't you feel it, Alice?

51
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:06,050
We're on the verge
of a new millennium.

52
00:05:06,294 --> 00:05:09,172
You need to stick with your boy,
because I'm about to blow up.

53
00:05:09,414 --> 00:05:11,803
I mean, you'll see, this job,

54
00:05:12,054 --> 00:05:14,727
these empty pockets,
this waistline, gone.

55
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:17,809
Yeah. One day,

56
00:05:18,054 --> 00:05:20,284
I'm gonna own this town!

57
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:23,253
Is that what you think?

58
00:05:23,494 --> 00:05:24,529
I own this town?

59
00:05:24,774 --> 00:05:27,083
I just asked you to talk to the super
about the pipes, Ralph.

60
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:28,687
- That's all.
- Today?

61
00:05:28,934 --> 00:05:31,687
The Mets are in the seventh game of
the World Series, and you know this,

62
00:05:31,934 --> 00:05:34,050
and you want me
to think about plumbing?

63
00:05:37,414 --> 00:05:39,882
Okay, so it makes a little noise,
but so do you,

64
00:05:40,134 --> 00:05:41,852
and I've learned to live with that.

65
00:05:42,094 --> 00:05:43,527
Ralph.

66
00:05:44,734 --> 00:05:47,294
Fine. But I'm not dragging
the super into this.

67
00:05:47,534 --> 00:05:49,286
I'm calling my boy Norton.
He works in the sewers.

68
00:05:49,534 --> 00:05:50,728
He knows pipes.

69
00:05:52,574 --> 00:05:54,371
Yo, Norton!

70
00:05:56,214 --> 00:05:57,363
What's up with the Mets?

71
00:05:57,614 --> 00:05:59,445
- Today's the day, baby!
- Yeah, buddy.

72
00:06:02,774 --> 00:06:04,492
Oh, my God!
What did you do to my baby?

73
00:06:05,894 --> 00:06:07,213
I didn't do anything!

74
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:10,412
Never mind them, Ralphie.
I got a new riddle for you.

75
00:06:10,654 --> 00:06:13,214
- A man was born in 1955. What...?
- Not now.

76
00:06:13,454 --> 00:06:16,127
Alice wants you to get down here
and take a look at these pipes.

77
00:06:16,374 --> 00:06:17,966
- She's driving me crazy.
- All right.

78
00:06:21,854 --> 00:06:23,890
Don't come down that...
That thing is gonna kill you.

79
00:06:24,494 --> 00:06:26,052
He's coming down the fire escape.

80
00:06:28,094 --> 00:06:29,243
- Hey, Alice.
- Hey, Ed.

81
00:06:29,494 --> 00:06:32,406
Come on, Ralph.
A man was born in 1955.

82
00:06:32,654 --> 00:06:34,292
Today's his 18th birthday.

83
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:35,853
How's that possible, huh?

84
00:06:37,654 --> 00:06:40,168
1955 is not the year he was born.

85
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,294
It's the number of the hospital room
he was born in.

86
00:06:43,534 --> 00:06:45,126
Damn, you smart.

87
00:06:46,174 --> 00:06:47,493
What seems to be
the problem, Alice?

88
00:06:47,734 --> 00:06:48,723
Listen, Ed.

89
00:06:53,974 --> 00:06:55,089
I'm on it.

90
00:06:55,934 --> 00:06:57,526
- He's on it.
- Why does he gotta be on it?

91
00:06:57,774 --> 00:06:59,924
- What happened to you?
- Knock, knock.

92
00:07:00,174 --> 00:07:02,005
- Morning, Kramdens.
- Oh, hey, Trix.

93
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:04,210
- What you got there, Trixie?
- I made French toast.

94
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:06,490
Alice, I tried this
new powdered sugar,

95
00:07:06,734 --> 00:07:08,611
TastyMeds, it's the one
they give to the diabetics

96
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:11,368
right when they wake up
from the coma. Ninety-nine cents.

97
00:07:11,614 --> 00:07:13,969
A slight little aftertaste,
but it's still good. Right, Ralph?

98
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:17,773
See?
Trixie makes Ed French toast.

99
00:07:18,014 --> 00:07:20,608
- That's because Ed's not on TrimSpa.
- Oh, you got jokes.

100
00:07:20,854 --> 00:07:22,810
You just a regular
UPN sitcom, huh, Alice?

101
00:07:23,054 --> 00:07:25,522
- I gotta get to these pipes.
- Look, just fix it, okay?

102
00:07:25,774 --> 00:07:28,846
Lt'll be good to have some peace
and quiet around here.

103
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:32,773
- Yo! Yo!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

104
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:34,447
Ed, what'd you do now?

105
00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:35,843
They wanted me to fix their pipes.

106
00:07:36,094 --> 00:07:38,733
- Not knock a big hole in the wall!
- That's where the pipes are, Ralph.

107
00:07:38,974 --> 00:07:41,886
If you'd just talked to the landlord
like I asked you to in the first place...

108
00:07:42,134 --> 00:07:43,249
That's a much better idea,

109
00:07:43,494 --> 00:07:45,086
because I do my best work
down below.

110
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:47,768
- Now, that is true.
- I mean, I'm a professional.

111
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:51,131
People always call me and
want me to work on their plumbing.

112
00:07:51,374 --> 00:07:53,842
- All over the country...
- Get out!

113
00:07:54,094 --> 00:07:56,562
It's all right. It's okay.

114
00:07:57,694 --> 00:07:59,730
Take the wife,
leave the French toast.

115
00:07:59,974 --> 00:08:01,009
Oh, man.

116
00:08:01,254 --> 00:08:03,324
- See you at the diner, Alice.
- Later, Trix.

117
00:08:03,574 --> 00:08:04,529
Hey, Ralph. After work,

118
00:08:04,774 --> 00:08:06,730
- we gonna watch that game...
- Out!

119
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:08,967
Go Mets.

120
00:08:09,374 --> 00:08:11,444
You are certifiable, you know that?

121
00:08:11,694 --> 00:08:13,047
You ought to have
your head examined.

122
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:15,649
I'll have my head examined
anywhere in the United States.

123
00:08:15,894 --> 00:08:18,692
And you know what they're gonna find
when they look in there? Nothing!

124
00:08:21,454 --> 00:08:23,649
You know, I asked you to do one thing.
One thing.

125
00:08:23,894 --> 00:08:26,124
- You never appreciate anything I do.
- You always go on and on.

126
00:08:26,374 --> 00:08:28,205
- I can't take it anymore!
- I can't take it anymore!

127
00:08:28,454 --> 00:08:30,763
- You gotta go. Here's your lunch.
- I am late.

128
00:08:31,374 --> 00:08:33,490
- Hey, Tastykakes.
- Yeah. Be careful.

129
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:35,531
I always am.

130
00:08:40,974 --> 00:08:42,692
Stay out of the bus lane!

131
00:08:43,254 --> 00:08:46,007
- Hey!
- Vivek, my man.

132
00:08:46,254 --> 00:08:47,733
The Mets are going
all the way, Ralph.

133
00:08:48,454 --> 00:08:51,127
- You'll do very well.
- Oh, yeah. You know that.

134
00:08:51,374 --> 00:08:54,207
Do you have a wager
on the game tonight, Ralph?

135
00:08:54,454 --> 00:08:55,728
Well, no, not exactly.

136
00:08:55,974 --> 00:08:58,886
Let's just say I'm taking advantage
of certain economic opportunities.

137
00:08:59,134 --> 00:09:01,773
Or as my investment guru,
Bart Roberts, says,

138
00:09:03,254 --> 00:09:06,405
"Kick open the door,
and opportunity don't have to knock."

139
00:09:07,534 --> 00:09:08,762
Yeah, Bart Roberts.

140
00:09:12,014 --> 00:09:13,367
Order up.

141
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:17,852
Girls, come over here.
Come over here.

142
00:09:18,094 --> 00:09:20,050
I have something to show you.

143
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:22,683
This is your new uniform.

144
00:09:22,934 --> 00:09:25,607
- Oh, no. No.
- You don't like it?

145
00:09:25,854 --> 00:09:27,128
I like the neckline, the V...

146
00:09:27,374 --> 00:09:29,524
The health inspector
is coming soon.

147
00:09:29,774 --> 00:09:31,366
We got to keep everything clean.

148
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:32,933
Now, I'm gonna
show you something.

149
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:34,607
You see this?

150
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:37,167
And then...

151
00:09:38,014 --> 00:09:40,005
- See, spotless.
- Voilà.

152
00:09:40,254 --> 00:09:42,609
- Yes.
- Excuse me!

153
00:0900:09:42,894 --> 00:09:45,089
I'd like to order.

154
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:49,973
Alice, please take him because
I can tell he's gonna get on my nerves.

155
00:09:50,694 --> 00:09:52,844
- Hi, how can I help you today?
- Yes,

156
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:55,767
Alice, I would like
an egg-white omelette,

157
00:09:56,014 --> 00:09:57,845
and if I could get
a clean glass of water.

158
00:09:58,094 --> 00:10:00,005
Well, precious,
we don't separate our eggs here,

159
00:10:00,254 --> 00:10:02,370
and that's about as clean
as it's gonna get.

160
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,772
Well, what do you have that's similar
to an egg-white omelette?

161
00:10:06,014 --> 00:10:07,129
Eggs.

162
00:10:07,894 --> 00:10:11,204
By all means, why don't you just bring
me whatever's convenient for you.

163
00:10:12,214 --> 00:10:15,445
- Do I need to take off my heels?
- No, no. Not yet.

164
00:10:16,134 --> 00:10:18,284
I've angered you. I'm sorry.
It happens a lot.

165
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,968
- Alice, hello.
- Oh, hi, Miss Benvenuti.

166
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:22,488
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

167
00:10:22,734 --> 00:10:25,407
- Hi, Trixie.
- Miss Benvenuti, what a pleasure.

168
00:10:25,614 --> 00:10:26,569
Please.

169
00:10:26,814 --> 00:10:30,284
If you just buy my house,
that will be pleasure enough.

170
00:10:30,534 --> 00:10:33,606
Miss Benvenuti, you're selling that
cute little duplex over on Hart Street?

171
00:10:33,854 --> 00:10:36,527
Yes. I can't take
the winters anymore.

172
00:10:37,294 --> 00:10:41,446
Mr. Davis here and his company
are thinking of buying the house.

173
00:10:41,694 --> 00:10:43,366
Yes, we are.

174
00:10:43,614 --> 00:10:46,048
So if you girls could just go
and cook something...

175
00:10:46,414 --> 00:10:48,644
- Ignoring you.
- I wish we would've known.

176
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:50,486
We've been looking to buy
a duplex for years.

177
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,611
I'm sorry, but my company's
already buying this one.

178
00:10:52,854 --> 00:10:56,210
Yes, we're not a company or anything,
but we would like a nice place

179
00:10:56,454 --> 00:10:59,890
to move into with our husbands,
have a few little babies, a little Trixie.

180
00:11:00,134 --> 00:11:02,090
- Everything's so expensive nowadays.
- Yes, it is.

181
00:11:02,334 --> 00:11:04,609
Kind of wishing you hadn't
dropped out of high school, huh?

182
00:11:04,854 --> 00:11:06,207
Still ignoring you.

183
00:11:06,454 --> 00:11:09,571
So, Miss Benvenuti, how much
are you asking for the duplex?

184
00:11:13,374 --> 00:11:14,853
Alice?

185
00:11:18,894 --> 00:11:20,452
Cool.

186
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:29,362
- Yo, Norton!
- Yeah?

187
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:30,603
Let's go, Mets!

188
00:11:30,854 --> 00:11:33,732
- <i>Bottom of the ninth inning, two outs...</i>
- This is killing me right here, man.

189
00:11:33,974 --> 00:11:35,692
I'm telling you, the Mets
is gonna do their thing.

190
00:11:35,934 --> 00:11:38,528
- Don't worry.
- Cameron can't strike out this time.

191
00:11:38,774 --> 00:11:39,843
I mean, what is he doing?

192
00:11:40,094 --> 00:11:42,654
- Yeah, right. I know.
- The guy hits good, you know?

193
00:11:43,254 --> 00:11:45,722
Ed, the most amazing thing
happened today.

194
00:11:45,974 --> 00:11:47,293
- You have to listen...
- Come on, baby.

195
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:50,253
We don't bother you when you're
watching your stories. Let us watch.

196
00:11:50,494 --> 00:11:53,611
- We got great news, though.
- Not now, baby. This is the last inning.

197
00:11:53,854 --> 00:11:55,287
- You have money on this game?
- No.

198
00:11:55,534 --> 00:11:57,729
I'm a businessman, okay,
Not a gambler.

199
00:11:57,974 --> 00:12:00,442
- Come on, Mets!
- You remember Miss Benvenuti?

200
00:12:00,694 --> 00:12:03,162
- Well, she's selling her duplex.
- It's a huge duplex.

201
00:12:03,414 --> 00:12:06,087
All we have to do is come up
with $20,000 for the down payment.

202
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:08,928
- But she's only giving us two weeks.
- <i>Cameron grounds it foul.</i>

203
00:12:09,174 --> 00:12:10,812
- Swing the bat!
- Wait, wait, you guys, listen.

204
00:12:11,054 --> 00:12:12,328
Just listen, just listen.

205
00:12:12,574 --> 00:12:14,804
Yeah, between the four of us,
we already have half of it.

206
00:12:15,054 --> 00:12:16,692
They've got 5,000 saved.
We got 5,300, right?

207
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:18,162
Something like that, give or take.

208
00:12:18,414 --> 00:12:21,724
- He's got a full count, man.
- What are they trying to do, kill me?

209
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,692
What do you mean, "give or take"?

210
00:12:24,054 --> 00:12:27,330
Ralph, you didn't take any money
out of our savings account, did you?

211
00:12:27,574 --> 00:12:29,166
- I don't know what she's talking about.
- You know.

212
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:32,611
Maybe I went into our accounts,
And maybe I took some money.

213
00:12:32,854 --> 00:12:35,766
But then again, maybe someone
has a birthday coming up,

214
00:12:36,014 --> 00:12:37,845
and I'm just trying to surprise her.

215
00:12:38,094 --> 00:12:40,005
My birthday's in eight months,
Ralph.

216
00:12:40,254 --> 00:12:42,848
Okay, maybe I got
The dates mixed up.

217
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:44,288
She knows who the boss is.

218
00:12:47,094 --> 00:12:49,528
- I know who the boss, baby.
- Here they go. Here they go, man.

219
00:12:49,774 --> 00:12:53,005
Make me some money, baby. Get
this hit right here. It's for the marbles.

220
00:12:53,254 --> 00:12:54,607
<i>Three-two pitch. Cameron swings</i>

221
00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:57,322
- <i>and sends it deep to left!</i>
- Oh, he got a hold of it.

222
00:12:57,574 --> 00:12:59,690
- It's going deep!
- <i>it’s out of here! </i>

223
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:03,649
Yeah!

224
00:13:03,894 --> 00:13:05,850
Yeah, Mets! That's what I thought!

225
00:13:08,494 --> 00:13:10,962
My baby! You know
we don't have no insurance.

226
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:12,852
- Norton, gets up! The Mets!
- Mets!

227
00:13:13,094 --> 00:13:15,130
Yes, baby! We won!

228
00:13:15,374 --> 00:13:17,729
What did I tell you? The Mets.

229
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:20,927
What did I tell you? I'm goanna
show you what's in these boxes.

230
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:23,290
- I wanna see.
- There's money in these boxes, baby.

231
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:25,365
Money, money, money.
Money for anything you want.

232
00:13:25,614 --> 00:13:27,889
Money for the house.
Money for anything.

233
00:13:28,134 --> 00:13:30,125
You gotta be fast on your feet
to make it in this world.

234
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:32,888
When I'm the first one to hit
the streets with this stuff,

235
00:13:33,134 --> 00:13:34,169
I'm gonna make a fortune.

236
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,245
- What stuff, Ed?
- Mets stuff.

237
00:13:36,494 --> 00:13:37,643
Official  merchandise.

238
00:13:37,894 --> 00:13:40,124
Ralph met a guy on the bus
Who gave him a <i>Godfather</i> deal.

239
00:13:40,374 --> 00:13:42,649
Yeah, that's right. <i>Godfather</i> deal.

240
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:50,405
Never seen a Met fan
wearing one of those.

241
00:13:50,654 --> 00:13:51,609
No, that's a throwback.

242
00:13:51,854 --> 00:13:54,129
It's gotta be in the other box.
This is the wrong one.

243
00:13:54,374 --> 00:13:55,602
You know we don't play.

244
00:13:56,974 --> 00:13:59,283
- It's this box right here.
- They just made a mistake.

245
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:01,729
- Yeah.
- It's all good.

246
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:05,250
- Get ready, ladies.
- Yeah. That's it. Cash-ola.

247
00:14:05,494 --> 00:14:07,450
This is it. Here we go.

248
00:14:07,694 --> 00:14:08,809
There it is.

249
00:14:14,294 --> 00:14:16,808
Ralph, why?
You know, you had to know better.

250
00:14:17,054 --> 00:14:18,851
This would've been
big money, baby.

251
00:14:19,094 --> 00:14:20,527
I mean...

252
00:14:20,774 --> 00:14:22,287
I was investing in your future.

253
00:14:22,534 --> 00:14:26,527
Really? Like the time you invested
$900 to market the...?

254
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,729
- The pet cactus.
- Hey.

255
00:14:29,974 --> 00:14:31,327
Couple of kids get poked in the eye,

256
00:14:31,574 --> 00:14:33,769
get cornea colitis
and ruin it for everybody?

257
00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:37,211
- That's not my fault.
- Oh, my personal favourite,

258
00:14:37,454 --> 00:14:39,172
the velour fanny pack.

259
00:14:39,414 --> 00:14:40,563
That's a man-purse.

260
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:42,691
And I was this close
to getting Al Roker

261
00:14:42,934 --> 00:14:44,333
to wear one on the <i>Today</i> show,
wasn't I?

262
00:14:44,574 --> 00:14:46,565
He sure was. He was this close.

263
00:14:46,814 --> 00:14:48,293
- I was with him...
- You're not helping, Ed.

264
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:51,571
Listen, Alice, we'll get the money
for the house somehow.

265
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:54,165
No, we won't.

266
00:14:54,414 --> 00:14:55,893
It's always gonna be like this, Trix.

267
00:14:56,774 --> 00:14:58,685
Living paycheck to paycheck,
hand-to-mouth,

268
00:14:58,934 --> 00:15:00,731
never having anything
to call our own.

269
00:15:00,974 --> 00:15:03,044
But, no, you know what?
Hey, it's cool, right?

270
00:15:03,294 --> 00:15:06,127
Because most people in the world
live like this, right?

271
00:15:07,014 --> 00:15:09,403
I just didn't think it'd be so hard.

272
00:15:09,654 --> 00:15:12,009
Alice. Alice, come on.

273
00:15:18,774 --> 00:15:20,765
I know, from the outside looking in,

274
00:15:21,014 --> 00:15:23,528
it seems as though
I have a perfect relationship,

275
00:15:23,774 --> 00:15:27,528
but the truth of the matter is that
Alice and I don't always get along.

276
00:15:27,854 --> 00:15:30,368
Wow, I never noticed that!

277
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:33,164
Look, man, she's mad,
but she'll get over it.

278
00:15:33,414 --> 00:15:34,483
She wasn't mad.

279
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,725
Mad, you do get over.
Mad, I can handle.

280
00:15:36,974 --> 00:15:38,965
I know how to deal with mad.

281
00:15:39,214 --> 00:15:41,603
But the look she had
on her face, it was like

282
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:44,812
she was disappointed in me.
Like she didn't believe in me anymore.

283
00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:48,524
And I don't know, if that's the case,
then how do you come back from that?

284
00:15:48,774 --> 00:15:50,605
Show her that you're sorry.
Buy her ass something.

285
00:15:50,854 --> 00:15:52,970
With what? I'm broke!

286
00:15:53,214 --> 00:15:56,763
Look, check this out. I know a dude
right now selling Cadillac wheels.

287
00:15:57,014 --> 00:15:58,652
I'm talking about the spinners,
the gold ones.

288
00:15:58,894 --> 00:16:00,122
We ain't got no damn car.

289
00:16:00,374 --> 00:16:03,172
- I also know a dude that sell earrings...
- Norton.

290
00:16:03,934 --> 00:16:06,289
Look, it's getting crazy out here.
Okay, come on.

291
00:16:06,534 --> 00:16:07,762
Let's go shoot some pool.

292
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:10,050
That's why I never like
to brainstorm around you.

293
00:16:10,294 --> 00:16:11,693
You're very critical.

294
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,610
Wait, now. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

295
00:16:16,854 --> 00:16:18,890
- Why do you get to break?
- I'll tell you why.

296
00:16:19,134 --> 00:16:20,806
Because you broke last time.

297
00:16:21,054 --> 00:16:22,612
No, no. You broke last time.

298
00:16:22,854 --> 00:16:25,732
Know what? Fine. We'll flip for it.

299
00:16:25,974 --> 00:16:27,202
Here, you call.

300
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:30,647
- I wanna flip.
- Okay, flip.

301
00:16:30,894 --> 00:16:33,203
- Okay, I'm gonna flip it.
- Flip it.

302
00:16:33,454 --> 00:16:35,251
- Heads.
- No, I wanted heads.

303
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,769
- Well, tails, then!
- I wanted tails too.

304
00:16:38,014 --> 00:16:39,686
I got a big appetite for tails too.

305
00:16:39,934 --> 00:16:41,686
- Just break!
- I'm gonna do it!

306
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,289
You are the most ridiculous man
I've ever met.

307
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:47,207
Maybe so, but I'm breaking.

308
00:17:24,094 --> 00:17:25,163
Would you just shoot!

309
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:32,807
- That's on you, Ralph.
- Oh, no, you don't, Norton.

310
00:17:33,054 --> 00:17:35,329
- Hey.
- Oh, it's on, baby.

311
00:17:35,574 --> 00:17:37,405
- Ralphie!
- Norton!

312
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:43,446
Where's my other hand?
I can't find my hand!

313
00:17:43,694 --> 00:17:45,605
It's right there. It's there.

314
00:17:46,694 --> 00:17:47,729
Hold up.

315
00:17:47,974 --> 00:17:50,488
No, no. I'm gonna go back in there.
Don't hold me back.

316
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:52,213
How you gonna throw
Ralph Kramden out?

317
00:17:52,454 --> 00:17:54,763
- Ralph?
- I'm gonna go back.

318
00:17:55,414 --> 00:17:57,325
What are you doing?
I was about to go back in there.

319
00:17:57,574 --> 00:17:59,132
No time to play.

320
00:17:59,374 --> 00:18:01,330
We got a major backup
in the sewer system.

321
00:18:01,574 --> 00:18:03,212
How come every time a toilet clogs,
they call you?

322
00:18:03,454 --> 00:18:04,887
I'm a specialist.

323
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:07,125
It's like being a brain surgeon
or Spider-Man.

324
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:10,764
Spider-Man wouldn't have got us beat
down and thrown out of no pool hall.

325
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:16,250
Come in, Trix.

326
00:18:25,134 --> 00:18:28,046
- What do you have on?
- You don't recognise my Ralph gear?

327
00:18:28,294 --> 00:18:31,127
I got my loud-ass lime-green T-shirt
that should've made us millionaires.

328
00:18:31,374 --> 00:18:34,013
My 1987 leopard-print fanny pack,

329
00:18:34,254 --> 00:18:36,051
complete inside
with a baby pet cactus,

330
00:18:36,294 --> 00:18:37,886
In case a brother wanna
Get rowdy on the train,

331
00:18:38,134 --> 00:18:39,613
Because you know
how they can act up.

332
00:18:40,414 --> 00:18:43,133
And to top it off:

333
00:18:44,654 --> 00:18:45,973
The Rainbrella Kangol.

334
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:50,092
And you know I'll wear it 24/7
because rain isn’t got no schedule.

335
00:18:50,334 --> 00:18:51,813
It's kind of sexy.

336
00:18:52,054 --> 00:18:54,488
Come on, Alice, you gotta admit,
Your man is trying.

337
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,248
Yeah. Yeah.

338
00:19:22,734 --> 00:19:25,373
This is what I do, huh?

339
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:29,370
Right, right. Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, yeah.

340
00:19:29,614 --> 00:19:32,333
Yeah, baby, man! Come on, Ralph.

341
00:19:32,574 --> 00:19:35,725
I know I smell a little stinky, but come
on and give your man some love.

342
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:39,325
I'm cool on the love. Thank you.

343
00:19:39,654 --> 00:19:41,531
- Can we go?
- It's this way.

344
00:19:44,534 --> 00:19:46,490
Come on, Ralph.
I got something to show you.

345
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:47,883
This the scenic route.

346
00:19:48,134 --> 00:19:52,013
- We're lost, aren't we?
- Ralph, if you lay it out end to end,

347
00:19:52,254 --> 00:19:57,374
The New York City sewer system
Will stretch about 6,600 miles.

348
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,286
A city beneath the city.

349
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:01,889
And I got it all right here.

350
00:20:05,094 --> 00:20:07,289
It's just around here, Ralph.

351
00:20:07,534 --> 00:20:08,933
Check this out.
It's gonna be worth it.

352
00:20:24,214 --> 00:20:27,012
City beneath the city.

353
00:20:28,814 --> 00:20:32,727
Damn! Mahogany panelling,
velvet curtains. This is bad.

354
00:20:32,974 --> 00:20:35,932
What I tell you? We find these
down here from time to time.

355
00:20:36,174 --> 00:20:39,211
Owned by some rich white dude
before flying got popular, Ralph.

356
00:20:39,454 --> 00:20:41,649
- Solid brass.
- Imagine that.

357
00:20:41,894 --> 00:20:45,330
- Rich enough to own your own train.
- Well, someone's going to.

358
00:20:45,574 --> 00:20:48,088
The city's auctioning it off.
I don't know what for, though.

359
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:51,451
Who would want to own
their own train car?

360
00:20:57,934 --> 00:21:00,004
Norton!

361
00:21:00,254 --> 00:21:02,006
- What is it, Ralph?
- This is it.

362
00:21:02,254 --> 00:21:05,326
- What's it?
- We buy the train.

363
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:08,566
We put an engine on it. Slap some
wheels on it. Maybe a new paint job.

364
00:21:08,814 --> 00:21:12,170
I can get Alice to decorate.
And we'll give tours of New York City.

365
00:21:12,414 --> 00:21:15,451
"I'm Ralph Kramden, and welcome
to New York and all the five boroughs."

366
00:21:15,694 --> 00:21:18,970
You know what, Ralph? Those tours
make a lot of money too, man.

367
00:21:19,214 --> 00:21:20,727
- This is why you need me.
- Yeah.

368
00:21:20,974 --> 00:21:23,010
Sometimes you gotta take
the long view.

369
00:21:23,254 --> 00:21:24,289
- Yeah.
- Okay.

370
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:28,766
So we won't be able to get
the girls some little duplex now.

371
00:21:29,014 --> 00:21:30,732
- All right.
- But soon...

372
00:21:30,974 --> 00:21:33,693
- Yeah?
- We can buy them a palace.

373
00:21:36,614 --> 00:21:38,411
Yeah, man, this is it.

374
00:21:45,454 --> 00:21:48,890
Oh, yeah. This is the place
where it's gonna go down.

375
00:21:49,134 --> 00:21:51,409
Hey, I got another riddle
for you, Ralph.

376
00:21:51,654 --> 00:21:53,610
Norton, not now, okay?
I'm assessing the room.

377
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,129
Look, look.
Twelve o'clock, right there.

378
00:21:56,374 --> 00:21:58,968
It's a fellow entrepreneur.
I know one when I see him.

379
00:21:59,214 --> 00:22:00,772
He's looking at our train.

380
00:22:01,014 --> 00:22:02,891
We don't have the cash
to get into a bidding war.

381
00:22:03,134 --> 00:22:05,329
- We really don't.
- According to my investment guru,

382
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,771
Bart Roberts,
"If you know you can't compete,

383
00:22:09,014 --> 00:22:10,891
you may have to practice deceit."

384
00:22:24,974 --> 00:22:28,887
Now, that there is a very fine train.

385
00:22:29,134 --> 00:22:32,809
- Ralph Kramden.
- Hitako Kawakami.

386
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:36,804
Well, thank you,
Mr. "Hikato Kamakwami."

387
00:22:37,454 --> 00:22:40,969
There we go. This is me right here.

388
00:22:44,734 --> 00:22:46,008
Well, for now.

389
00:22:46,254 --> 00:22:49,007
But we are expanding
to a more global approach.

390
00:22:52,054 --> 00:22:54,807
Man, they must have dug
in the archives for this old picture.

391
00:22:55,054 --> 00:22:56,123
- What do you mean?
- Well,

392
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,604
this doesn't look anything
like the train they're selling.

393
00:22:59,214 --> 00:23:00,363
No.

394
00:23:01,134 --> 00:23:03,284
- You've seen it?
- Have I seen...?

395
00:23:03,534 --> 00:23:05,889
Of course I've seen it.
It's right out the door.

396
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,489
Come with me,
and I'll show you the train.

397
00:23:12,814 --> 00:23:16,124
Sold! Two-thirty,
lucky lady in the back.

398
00:23:16,454 --> 00:23:18,524
- Next up, an off-site item.
- It's back and to the left.

399
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:21,686
- A Pullman train car.
- Train car?

400
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:23,765
We'll start the bidding at $1,000.

401
00:23:24,014 --> 00:23:26,687
- One thousand dollars.
- I want to bid!

402
00:23:26,934 --> 00:23:28,652
- Do I hear two?
- Two thousand!

403
00:23:28,854 --> 00:23:29,809
Ralph!

404
00:23:30,054 --> 00:23:32,614
Two thousand. Two thousand
from the guy over by the door.

405
00:23:32,854 --> 00:23:34,845
- Norton, stop!
- Do I hear 2,500?

406
00:23:35,094 --> 00:23:37,927
Twenty-five hundred for my friend
who's going in the right direction.

407
00:23:38,174 --> 00:23:39,653
- Three thousand dollars!
- Three thousand.

408
00:23:39,894 --> 00:23:41,452
- Get him out!
- Thirty-five hundred!

409
00:23:42,094 --> 00:23:44,085
- No.
- Thirty-five hundred, going once.

410
00:23:44,334 --> 00:23:46,165
I'm bidding over here.

411
00:23:46,414 --> 00:23:48,132
Once, twice, three times!
The train is mine!

412
00:23:48,374 --> 00:23:50,410
- Sold!
- Thank you.

413
00:23:55,454 --> 00:23:57,172
I wish you would. I'm a purple belt.

414
00:24:01,014 --> 00:24:06,042
<i>America, America</i>

415
00:24:06,294 --> 00:24:07,886
You're so good.
Why didn't you become a singer?

416
00:24:08,134 --> 00:24:10,011
I know I should've,
but I have acid reflux.

417
00:24:10,254 --> 00:24:12,643
- You know that.
- It's the competition.

418
00:24:13,094 --> 00:24:14,732
Hi, Alice. Hi, Alice's friend.

419
00:24:14,974 --> 00:24:16,885
My name is Trixie,
and I don't like you.

420
00:24:17,134 --> 00:24:20,365
Oh, stop, please.
We got off to a bad start.

421
00:24:20,614 --> 00:24:23,174
- I'd like to make amends.
- It's about time somebody does.

422
00:24:23,414 --> 00:24:25,405
You wanna live in the Benvenuti
place, and I wanna own it.

423
00:24:25,654 --> 00:24:26,928
We can all get what we want.

424
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,289
- Should I cut him?
- Let's go.

425
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:32,413
No, listen. I'm developing
15 affordable units on that property.

426
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:36,567
I'll save a big, fat, sunny corner unit
for each of you. I'm a fun landlord.

427
00:24:36,814 --> 00:24:39,692
Fifteen units on that little lot?
That doesn't make a lot of sense.

428
00:24:40,774 --> 00:24:44,562
I'm developing the whole block, but
I need her property to close the deal.

429
00:24:44,814 --> 00:24:47,612
- I think he's crazy, Alice. Look at him.
- Forget it.

430
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:49,526
We don't do crazy.

431
00:24:54,454 --> 00:24:56,285
How's it looking, Lenny?

432
00:24:56,814 --> 00:24:58,088
It's not bad.

433
00:24:59,054 --> 00:25:02,126
I have four or five old engines
back at the bus yard.

434
00:25:02,374 --> 00:25:04,330
Drive shaft. Wheels.

435
00:25:04,574 --> 00:25:06,690
I can turn this into
a first-rate tour bus.

436
00:25:06,934 --> 00:25:09,892
What'd I tell you? Lenny,
the best mechanic in the whole MTA.

437
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,284
He said it.
How much, Lenny? How much?

438
00:25:12,534 --> 00:25:13,853
For Ralph,
whatever it costs for parts.

439
00:25:14,094 --> 00:25:16,733
And I get most of them for free,
if you know what I mean.

440
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,249
We gonna be rich!
We gonna be rich!

441
00:25:19,494 --> 00:25:20,893
- What'd I tell you?
- You said it.

442
00:25:21,134 --> 00:25:23,329
You gonna be rich! Hey, Lenny,
I'm gonna let you in on it too.

443
00:25:23,574 --> 00:25:24,848
I'm gonna give him something.

444
00:25:25,094 --> 00:25:27,927
Hey, Ralph,
I got one question for you.

445
00:25:28,414 --> 00:25:29,847
How you gonna get this thing
out of here?

446
00:25:30,094 --> 00:25:33,370
Lenny, it's a train, okay?
We're just gonna roll it out.

447
00:25:33,614 --> 00:25:35,286
We're gonna roll it out.

448
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,173
How you gonna do that
when all you have is...

449
00:25:39,094 --> 00:25:40,925
...20 feet of track?

450
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:49,642
You don't need...

451
00:25:49,894 --> 00:25:52,044
You don't need track
to roll a train out, do you?

452
00:25:53,854 --> 00:25:56,163
It's 60 feet below street level.

453
00:25:56,414 --> 00:25:58,803
It's gonna cost you a fortune
to move that train.

454
00:25:59,054 --> 00:26:01,204
Well, Ralph...

455
00:26:01,454 --> 00:26:03,729
...look like you...

456
00:26:03,974 --> 00:26:06,044
...Gladys Knight without the Pips.

457
00:26:11,454 --> 00:26:14,173
What are you doing out so late,
Miss Celestine?

458
00:26:14,414 --> 00:26:16,086
I could ask you
the same question.

459
00:26:16,854 --> 00:26:19,971
It looks like I'm gonna be doing
a lot of double shifts from now on.

460
00:26:20,214 --> 00:26:22,205
Oh, really?

461
00:26:22,454 --> 00:26:23,523
What's your poison?

462
00:26:23,774 --> 00:26:24,763
Gambling?

463
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:27,204
Drink? Ho's?

464
00:26:27,454 --> 00:26:30,014
Oh, no. No, no. None of that.

465
00:26:30,254 --> 00:26:33,485
Just worked myself into a jam,
trying to get along a little better.

466
00:26:34,014 --> 00:26:35,527
Aren't we all?

467
00:26:52,574 --> 00:26:54,610
Man, I worked
four double shifts this week.

468
00:26:54,854 --> 00:26:57,243
Damn, Ralph, we need
to pimp some midgets.

469
00:26:57,494 --> 00:26:58,643
Yeah, tell me about it.

470
00:26:58,894 --> 00:27:01,283
- What was that?
- I don't know.

471
00:27:01,534 --> 00:27:04,332
Sounded like a big rat or something.
Come on, let's go.

472
00:27:04,574 --> 00:27:06,769
What are you do...? Norton,
what are you doing, man?

473
00:27:07,014 --> 00:27:09,403
- Get away from the Dumpster.
- It's a dog. Oh, man.

474
00:27:09,654 --> 00:27:10,973
Why would somebody
do this to a dog?

475
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:12,408
- Ralph, give me some help.
- What?

476
00:27:12,654 --> 00:27:15,964
- I'm not coming near no Dumpster.
- Ralph, give me some help, man.

477
00:27:17,294 --> 00:27:18,249
- Come on.
- Pull him out.

478
00:27:29,934 --> 00:27:31,049
Look at him, Ralph.

479
00:27:31,534 --> 00:27:34,492
I'm gonna clean him up,
put him a nice little collar on him,

480
00:27:34,734 --> 00:27:36,725
some rhinestones.

481
00:27:36,974 --> 00:27:39,283
- Call him lggy.
- Iggy?

482
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:41,525
Lggy's a perfect name
for a dog in the 'hood.

483
00:27:41,774 --> 00:27:44,413
Come on, don't get so excited,
all right? We're not keeping the dog.

484
00:27:44,654 --> 00:27:46,724
The super would never let us
have him in the building.

485
00:27:46,974 --> 00:27:48,930
I ain't got time for a dog
anyway, Ralph.

486
00:27:49,174 --> 00:27:51,563
The dog is not coming with us.
Let's go.

487
00:27:53,934 --> 00:27:57,643
Don't worry about it, lggy.
You're coming home with us, baby.

488
00:28:04,894 --> 00:28:06,532
Oh, boy.

489
00:28:07,374 --> 00:28:10,491
- There's some leftovers in the kitchen.
- Oh, it's okay, baby.

490
00:28:10,734 --> 00:28:12,372
I ate already with Norton.

491
00:28:12,614 --> 00:28:14,411
- I'm sorry to wake you.
- You didn't wake me.

492
00:28:14,654 --> 00:28:16,724
I couldn't sleep.
I keep hearing barking.

493
00:28:16,974 --> 00:28:20,091
I think somebody snuck a dog
in the building or something.

494
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:23,326
I'm sure you're just imagining things.

495
00:28:25,894 --> 00:28:28,124
These double shifts are killing me.

496
00:28:30,534 --> 00:28:32,445
- Baby?
- Yeah.

497
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:36,127
That house means the world to me.
I'm not gonna lose it without a fight.

498
00:28:36,374 --> 00:28:37,773
If we can't get the money
by next Monday,

499
00:28:38,014 --> 00:28:41,529
Mrs. B's gonna be forced to sell it
to that idiot developer William Davis.

500
00:28:41,774 --> 00:28:44,925
And, well...

501
00:28:45,494 --> 00:28:46,722
I'm gonna ask my mama
for the money.

502
00:28:47,214 --> 00:28:48,932
What? Your mama don't have
that kind of money.

503
00:28:49,174 --> 00:28:51,642
It's $10,000.
That's all we need, right?

504
00:28:51,854 --> 00:28:52,809
Well, sure.

505
00:28:53,054 --> 00:28:55,204
That's if I hadn't spent the rest
of it on the train.

506
00:28:55,774 --> 00:28:58,811
No, I was just kind of adding it
up in my brain.

507
00:28:59,374 --> 00:29:00,807
And...

508
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:04,893
Baby, you really should go by
and see the house.

509
00:29:05,134 --> 00:29:06,692
I mean, Norton's already seen it.

510
00:29:06,934 --> 00:29:10,051
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna get by there.
- Yeah?

511
00:29:10,294 --> 00:29:12,649
Yeah. Yeah.

512
00:29:13,494 --> 00:29:15,212
Thank you.

513
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,369
I talked to some guys about getting
the train out of the sewer.

514
00:29:24,614 --> 00:29:26,445
- How much?
- You don't wanna know.

515
00:29:26,694 --> 00:29:29,413
We gotta get ahold
of some cash, today.

516
00:29:29,654 --> 00:29:31,531
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

517
00:29:32,414 --> 00:29:33,893
Yeah, look at that, man.

518
00:29:34,174 --> 00:29:36,085
Break money. Break money.

519
00:29:36,334 --> 00:29:39,212
Come on, put some money in here.
This is how we make a living.

520
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,766
Sorry to disturb you
at this time, ma'am.

521
00:30:10,014 --> 00:30:11,527
- My name is Ed.
- And I'm Ralph.

522
00:30:11,774 --> 00:30:13,287
And what a lovely home you have.

523
00:30:13,934 --> 00:30:17,085
Help us. We can't see a thing.

524
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:19,689
Billy. What's up?
It's Ralph Kramden.

525
00:30:19,934 --> 00:30:21,367
How you doing? Vacation...

526
00:30:21,614 --> 00:30:23,127
Oh, it's William now.

527
00:30:23,374 --> 00:30:26,366
Remember I had loaned you $6?
You got that?

528
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,092
The Brooklyn Youth Program
is a program to keep

529
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,292
young little brothers like ourselves
off the street, from stealing hubcaps

530
00:30:39,534 --> 00:30:41,923
and breaking in your house
while you're not at home.

531
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:52,329
Jeannie Lincoln.
Remember we went on a date,

532
00:30:52,574 --> 00:30:54,804
and it was supposed to be Dutch,
but I paid?

533
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:57,522
- Two blind men and a dog.
- That's a nice little sweater there.

534
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:59,924
- Hey.
- Hey.

535
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:14,211
Yeah, man.

536
00:31:14,454 --> 00:31:16,410
Throw a dog a bone.
Throw a dog...

537
00:31:16,654 --> 00:31:18,451
Wait a minute, motherf...
Now, I want some money.

538
00:31:18,694 --> 00:31:20,127
Now, wait a minute.
Give me $5, man.

539
00:31:27,854 --> 00:31:30,129
- Hey, come here!
- Hey, what are you doing?

540
00:31:37,574 --> 00:31:39,087
Get off of...!

541
00:31:39,334 --> 00:31:41,450
Ed, you've gotta do something
about this dog.

542
00:31:41,694 --> 00:31:43,525
I told you I'm watching him
for a friend.

543
00:31:44,094 --> 00:31:45,607
Here, boy. Go get it!

544
00:31:46,934 --> 00:31:50,449
When things go right with this house,
we can get a dog for the yard.

545
00:31:51,054 --> 00:31:53,614
- And name him Patches?
- Or lggy.

546
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:55,972
Iggy?

547
00:31:57,734 --> 00:32:00,407
I mean, man,
have you seen the house?

548
00:32:00,654 --> 00:32:02,690
It's got a back yard for lggy
and everything.

549
00:32:03,174 --> 00:32:06,803
Yeah, man. So Alice invited
her mother over for dinner.

550
00:32:07,054 --> 00:32:08,533
Her mama's coming?
I better come over there

551
00:32:08,774 --> 00:32:10,412
with my referee T-shirt on, then.

552
00:32:10,654 --> 00:32:13,122
She plans on asking her
for the money for the house.

553
00:32:13,374 --> 00:32:15,649
Wait a minute. You done told
Alice about the train money?

554
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:17,327
Oh, no.

555
00:32:17,574 --> 00:32:19,485
It's been my experience
that too much honesty

556
00:32:19,734 --> 00:32:22,248
- can ruin a good relationship.
- Yeah.

557
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,087
Look at them over there.

558
00:32:24,774 --> 00:32:26,253
What do you think
they're talking about?

559
00:32:26,494 --> 00:32:30,009
Us, bad weaves,
fake Louis Vuitton purses.

560
00:32:30,254 --> 00:32:32,210
I mean, what do they
always talk about?

561
00:32:32,454 --> 00:32:33,682
Let's say the conforming
interest rate

562
00:32:33,934 --> 00:32:35,731
is 6.5 percent
at one and a half points.

563
00:32:35,974 --> 00:32:37,532
Does that leave us room
for a two-one buydown?

564
00:32:37,774 --> 00:32:39,844
I don't think you'd wanna do that
in the first three years,

565
00:32:40,094 --> 00:32:41,766
but we could always
run the numbers.

566
00:32:43,214 --> 00:32:44,806
- Look at them over there.
- No, no, no, Ed.

567
00:32:45,334 --> 00:32:46,687
What do you think
they're talking about?

568
00:32:46,894 --> 00:32:47,849
You know how men are.

569
00:32:48,094 --> 00:32:50,085
They'd like us to believe
they're talking about religion

570
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:52,723
or politics or economic injustice.

571
00:32:52,974 --> 00:32:54,692
But you know all they really care
about is...

572
00:32:54,934 --> 00:32:56,606
Beyoncé is more peach-shaped.

573
00:32:56,854 --> 00:32:59,163
Like the way Chaka Khan
used to be back in the day.

574
00:32:59,414 --> 00:33:02,804
Chaka Khan used to be built
like a bleach bottle back in the day.

575
00:33:06,614 --> 00:33:07,603
Yeah.

576
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:09,967
Hey, lggy.

577
00:33:11,374 --> 00:33:12,853
Go!

578
00:33:14,014 --> 00:33:15,447
Damn, that dog can run!

579
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:16,968
Oh, yeah.
You better believe it.

580
00:33:18,854 --> 00:33:20,207
Norton, that's it!

581
00:33:20,454 --> 00:33:22,126
We race lggy!

582
00:33:27,374 --> 00:33:29,888
How many years did you guys say
you've been racing greyhounds?

583
00:33:30,134 --> 00:33:31,613
- Eleven.
- Six.

584
00:33:31,854 --> 00:33:35,130
Eleven years,
but six times over dog years.

585
00:33:35,374 --> 00:33:38,491
- Right. 5 or 10  years.
- Of course. Give or take.

586
00:33:38,734 --> 00:33:40,884
- He got in it first.
- Actually, I brought him

587
00:33:41,134 --> 00:33:42,169
- Into the business.
- Right.

588
00:33:42,414 --> 00:33:44,530
- See, actually, we are brothers.
- Cousins.

589
00:33:44,734 --> 00:33:45,689
- Different moms.
- Yeah.

590
00:33:45,934 --> 00:33:47,526
My father used to train
neglected Chihuahuas.

591
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:48,689
- Gentlemen.
- And then...

592
00:33:48,934 --> 00:33:49,889
It really doesn't matter.

593
00:33:50,134 --> 00:33:52,284
What I do wanna know is
how it is you've been racing

594
00:33:52,534 --> 00:33:55,970
greyhound champions
for six to 11 years

595
00:33:56,214 --> 00:33:57,249
and I never heard of you.

596
00:33:58,134 --> 00:34:01,206
Well, actually, I can explain that.
You know, actually, we've...

597
00:34:01,454 --> 00:34:05,049
The past few years, we've been
racing exclusively in Argentina.

598
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:07,285
Yeah, you might've seen us
on Telemundo before.

599
00:34:07,534 --> 00:34:10,048
No, I didn't. I didn't know
they raced dogs in Argentina.

600
00:34:10,294 --> 00:34:12,091
Yeah, ever since
the shah took over, you know.

601
00:34:12,334 --> 00:34:14,723
The shah of Argentina?

602
00:34:14,974 --> 00:34:18,171
Look, Mr. Kirby, we got a dog here
who's itching to run.

603
00:34:18,414 --> 00:34:19,813
How about this weekend?

604
00:34:20,054 --> 00:34:22,773
This weekend is the track's
anniversary derby.

605
00:34:23,014 --> 00:34:24,242
Well, good. Sign us up.

606
00:34:24,494 --> 00:34:26,530
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

607
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:28,605
That's a $20,000 stakes race.

608
00:34:28,854 --> 00:34:30,526
Twenty thousand dollars,
American dollars?

609
00:34:30,774 --> 00:34:34,528
What he is saying is that we don't
normally race for such low stakes.

610
00:34:34,774 --> 00:34:36,810
- No, we don't.
- But we'll make an exception.

611
00:34:37,054 --> 00:34:38,931
Oh, hell, yeah.
We will make an exception.

612
00:34:40,374 --> 00:34:41,489
Stop. No, no, no.

613
00:34:41,734 --> 00:34:44,851
Well, kennel sickness has hit us
pretty hard this week.

614
00:34:45,214 --> 00:34:47,125
It's a very extensive
screening process.

615
00:34:47,374 --> 00:34:49,126
- Who's his sire?
- What's a sire?

616
00:34:49,374 --> 00:34:51,330
- His dam?
- His damn what?

617
00:34:51,774 --> 00:34:52,763
His lineage?

618
00:34:53,014 --> 00:34:54,208
Are you talking about his tailor?

619
00:34:54,414 --> 00:34:55,369
No, he don't wear clothes.

620
00:34:55,614 --> 00:34:57,411
He's got a 10-inch inseam.

621
00:34:58,174 --> 00:35:01,211
Mr. Kirby, look. We got a dog.
He's ready to run.

622
00:35:01,454 --> 00:35:02,967
You've had some scratches.

623
00:35:03,214 --> 00:35:05,125
- All we want is a chance.
- That's it.

624
00:35:07,294 --> 00:35:10,172
All right, I'm gonna give him
a time trial tomorrow.

625
00:35:10,414 --> 00:35:12,086
If he qualifies, he runs.

626
00:35:12,334 --> 00:35:14,006
- That's what I'm saying!
- All right.

627
00:35:14,254 --> 00:35:16,245
- Who's his trainer?
- He don't need no trainer, no.

628
00:35:16,494 --> 00:35:18,212
He don't need no trainer.
He's housebroken.

629
00:35:19,894 --> 00:35:22,203
He needs a trainer.

630
00:35:24,534 --> 00:35:27,002
Get Dodge. He's the guy for you.

631
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,567
You Dodge?

632
00:34:14,814 --> 00:34:17,044
Hell, no. You got the wrong sucker.

633
00:34:17,294 --> 00:34:19,171
Why, why? Who's asking?

634
00:34:19,414 --> 00:34:21,370
We're looking for a trainer.

635
00:34:22,174 --> 00:34:23,527
Why didn't you say so, man?

636
00:34:23,774 --> 00:34:25,605
What are you, socially retarded?

637
00:34:25,854 --> 00:34:27,003
What's up? The name is Dodge.

638
00:34:27,254 --> 00:34:29,529
Hey, what's up? Okay.

639
00:34:29,774 --> 00:34:31,526
- Who, Mr. Kirby sent you?
- Yeah.

640
00:34:31,774 --> 00:34:33,526
That's cool, man,
because I'm a canine behaviourist.

641
00:34:33,774 --> 00:34:35,253
I train, board and breed greyhounds.

642
02:00:35,494 --> 00:36:04,247
I specialise in temperamentally
unsound, psychologically unstable

643
00:36:04,494 --> 00:36:07,133
genetical throwbacks.
I do not pick up excreta.

644
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,649
And I run my facilities
right out of this place.

645
00:36:11,174 --> 00:36:13,893
It says here you sell time-shares
in the Poconos.

646
00:36:14,134 --> 00:36:16,250
What? Let me see that.

647
00:36:16,494 --> 00:36:18,724
Oh, yeah, my bad.
Wrong card, man.

648
00:36:18,974 --> 00:36:20,885
"Lmportifications.
Underage mail-order brides.

649
00:36:21,134 --> 00:36:22,613
S & M fashion consultant."

650
00:36:22,854 --> 00:36:24,253
You know what?
We don't need cards, man.

651
00:36:24,494 --> 00:36:25,813
We don't need cards.
We're dog people.

652
00:36:26,054 --> 00:36:27,692
We got a bond, a fellowship.

653
00:36:27,934 --> 00:36:29,492
Hey, look at the dog. Look at him.

654
00:36:29,734 --> 00:36:31,929
He seems really bright. Alert.

655
00:36:32,174 --> 00:36:33,812
- What's his name?
- That's lggy.

656
00:36:34,054 --> 00:36:37,524
- I'm Ralph and this is Ed.
- Hey, Ralph, Ed.

657
00:36:37,774 --> 00:36:39,173
You carry your dog around
on a rope?

658
00:36:39,414 --> 00:36:41,723
You siphon gas out of a car.
What's your point, man?

659
00:36:41,974 --> 00:36:44,249
What? What, you...? That?

660
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:46,246
- Yeah.
- You think I'm stealing?

661
00:36:46,494 --> 00:36:48,052
Man, that's my friend's car.

662
00:36:48,294 --> 00:36:50,330
Come on. We prank each other
all the time, you know.

663
00:36:50,574 --> 00:36:53,452
I siphon gas out of his car,
he siphons out of my car.

664
00:36:53,694 --> 00:36:54,843
Yadda-yadda, blasé-blasé.

665
00:36:55,094 --> 00:36:56,891
Hey. Tell you what I'm gonna do.

666
00:36:57,134 --> 00:37:00,092
I'm gonna train your dog
for $500. Cash.

667
00:37:01,614 --> 00:37:02,967
- I don't know.
- You know what?

668
00:37:03,214 --> 00:37:05,091
I'll let you think about it.
Give you a moment.

669
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:06,926
- Don't worry. No pressure.
- I don't know, Ed.

670
00:37:07,174 --> 00:37:08,846
Does this guy look
like a dog trainer?

671
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:11,085
What does a dog trainer
look like? I don't know.

672
00:37:11,334 --> 00:37:12,972
- But Kirby said Dodge.
- Yeah. That's what...

673
00:37:13,214 --> 00:37:14,567
- He said Dodge.
- That's what Kirby said.

674
00:37:14,814 --> 00:37:16,088
Okay. All right. Okay, we'll do it.

675
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,245
- We'll do it.
- All right. Good decision, man.

676
00:37:18,494 --> 00:37:20,007
Five hundred, cash.

677
00:37:20,254 --> 00:37:22,290
That's it, baby. Let me check.

678
00:37:22,934 --> 00:37:25,607
Hey! Hey, nice man-purse.

679
00:37:25,934 --> 00:37:27,128
You mean this fanny-pack thing?

680
00:37:27,374 --> 00:37:29,410
I got this off a homeless guy
in the park for a quarter.

681
00:37:29,654 --> 00:37:31,292
Some sucker made
like a thousand of these.

682
00:37:31,534 --> 00:37:33,126
Look, what are we gonna do
about the training?

683
00:37:33,374 --> 00:37:35,126
It's like this. Let me break it down
for you, okay?

684
00:37:35,374 --> 00:37:37,205
We're a partnership now,
a ménage à trois, all right?

685
00:37:37,454 --> 00:37:38,933
You put in capital,
I put in the experience.

686
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,324
At the end, you get the experience,
I keep the capital.

687
00:37:41,574 --> 00:37:44,042
Is that cool? Great. Great.

688
00:37:44,294 --> 00:37:46,250
The thing is, I like to work at night,
if you don't mind.

689
00:37:46,494 --> 00:37:48,246
During the day, it's just too crowded,
you know.

690
00:37:48,494 --> 00:37:49,927
Too many people, too many dogs.

691
00:37:50,174 --> 00:37:52,404
So let's say we meet out back
over there about 9 sharp?

692
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:54,485
- Okay, 9. Nine o'clock.
- All right.

693
00:37:54,734 --> 00:37:57,328
Remember, there are no bad dogs,
only bad owners.

694
00:37:57,574 --> 00:38:00,213
All right? Remember that.
I gotta bounce.

695
00:38:08,414 --> 00:38:09,369
Hi, Mom.

696
00:38:09,614 --> 00:38:12,333
Somewhere around the third flight
of stairs, I think I caught TB.

697
00:38:13,134 --> 00:38:15,125
- Here.
- Oh, a pie.

698
00:38:15,374 --> 00:38:18,491
Oh, and a box of wine.
That is so nice.

699
00:38:18,734 --> 00:38:21,726
Don't get too excited.
I'm taking back what we don't drink.

700
00:38:21,974 --> 00:38:25,011
Just have a seat on the couch and
relax, and I'll just pop a hole in the top

701
00:38:25,254 --> 00:38:26,653
- and bring you a glass.
- Table setting for three?

702
00:38:28,814 --> 00:38:30,213
- Does that mean he's gonna be here?
- He lives here.

703
00:38:30,454 --> 00:38:32,365
Not for long, if Jesus
would quit making movies

704
00:38:32,614 --> 00:38:34,206
and answer the prayers
of a righteous woman.

705
00:38:55,254 --> 00:38:57,210
Hey, sweet face.

706
00:38:59,494 --> 00:39:01,928
Hell, no! No, no.

707
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:05,371
- What happened?
- You married a damn pervert!

708
00:39:05,614 --> 00:39:06,683
That's what happened!

709
00:39:06,934 --> 00:39:08,731
Look, baby, it was just
a big misunderstanding.

710
00:39:08,974 --> 00:39:10,885
Next you'll probably say
you thought I was Alice.

711
00:39:11,134 --> 00:39:12,852
Of course I thought you were Alice!

712
00:39:14,294 --> 00:39:17,013
That's exactly
what a pervert would say.

713
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:19,290
Woman, one day
you are gonna push me too far.

714
00:39:19,534 --> 00:39:22,253
The only thing that could push you
is a bulldozer.

715
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:24,883
Mom, Mom, how about
you go wash up for dinner,

716
00:39:25,134 --> 00:39:26,931
because everything is
under control here.

717
00:39:27,174 --> 00:39:30,166
And I'll just deal
with my little pervert here.

718
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:38,289
What is she doing here?

719
00:39:38,534 --> 00:39:40,490
I'm asking my mother for the money
for the house tonight.

720
00:39:40,694 --> 00:39:41,649
- Tonight?
- Yes.

721
00:39:41,894 --> 00:39:42,849
No, no, no. Not tonight.

722
00:39:43,094 --> 00:39:45,927
Tonight you can't, because...

723
00:39:46,174 --> 00:39:48,847
...Norton and I have to go
to the lodge.

724
00:39:49,094 --> 00:39:51,289
The lodge? What are you,
Fred Flintstone all of a sudden?

725
00:39:51,534 --> 00:39:53,490
- The lodge?
- Look, l... Woman, l...

726
00:39:53,734 --> 00:39:55,133
I got somewhere to be.

727
00:39:55,374 --> 00:39:59,572
That's all you need to know,
and that's it.

728
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,088
I refuse to lose this house

729
00:40:01,334 --> 00:40:03,484
over another one of your
half-assed schemes, Ralph Kramden.

730
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,087
Half-assed scheme?

731
00:40:05,334 --> 00:40:06,562
Let me tell you something.

732
00:40:06,814 --> 00:40:09,487
This country was built
on half-assed schemes.

733
00:40:09,734 --> 00:40:11,964
I'm talking about
real inventive stuff here.

734
00:40:12,214 --> 00:40:14,011
Like the guy who came up
with the thong, okay?

735
00:40:14,254 --> 00:40:17,371
He was short on material
and he used what he had.

736
00:40:19,374 --> 00:40:21,330
I'm asking my mother for the money
for the house tonight,

737
00:40:21,574 --> 00:40:24,134
and I expect you, Ralph,
to be on your very best behaviour.

738
00:40:24,374 --> 00:40:26,524
Ralph Kramden.

739
00:40:26,774 --> 00:40:30,369
Your very best behaviour.

740
00:40:41,094 --> 00:40:44,086
Well, so far everything's edible.

741
00:40:50,974 --> 00:40:54,603
- How about I get the entrées?
- "Entrées."

742
00:40:54,854 --> 00:40:57,414
You going to France for those?

743
00:41:02,054 --> 00:41:03,851
Just one good swing.

744
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,925
What are you doing?

745
00:41:06,174 --> 00:41:08,324
Trixie's coming home.
I couldn't let her see lggy.

746
00:41:08,574 --> 00:41:10,610
You can't leave him here.
Alice's mama is over for dinner.

747
00:41:10,854 --> 00:41:12,526
She's in there right now
asking for house money.

748
00:41:13,014 --> 00:41:15,164
So if Alice gets the check,
and she tries to deposit...

749
00:41:15,414 --> 00:41:17,530
Yes, I know. She's gonna know
the account is empty.

750
00:41:17,774 --> 00:41:19,366
That's why this meal can't go well.

751
00:41:19,614 --> 00:41:20,763
How you gonna do that?

752
00:41:21,014 --> 00:41:23,050
I know you're probably in there
eating all our dinners.

753
00:41:23,294 --> 00:41:25,603
Just don't make the same mistake
you made last time.

754
00:41:25,854 --> 00:41:28,812
When you hit plate, stop.

755
00:41:42,454 --> 00:41:44,524
Oh, you're going straight
to hell for this one.

756
00:41:46,494 --> 00:41:49,167
Mother Gibson,
that's free-range chicken.

757
00:41:49,414 --> 00:41:52,486
What a chicken does on his free time
is no nevermind to me.

758
00:41:52,734 --> 00:41:54,690
This is way too much food for me.
I'm on a diet.

759
00:41:54,934 --> 00:41:56,686
Oh, here, take my plate.
I don't have that much.

760
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:58,526
- Thank you, baby.
- No, I wanted your mother

761
00:41:58,774 --> 00:42:01,652
- to have the white meat.
- I'm perfectly happy with the dark.

762
00:42:02,254 --> 00:42:03,926
- Give me the white meat, then.
- No, it's fine.

763
00:42:04,174 --> 00:42:05,163
- No. Give it.
- Ralph.

764
00:42:05,414 --> 00:42:06,847
No, give me the white meat.

765
00:42:07,094 --> 00:42:08,732
Give me the plate, woman!

766
00:42:08,974 --> 00:42:10,293
Mama?

767
00:42:13,654 --> 00:42:15,690
The chicken is delicious.

768
00:42:16,654 --> 00:42:17,803
Ralph.

769
00:42:18,294 --> 00:42:19,443
- Eat.
- Yeah.

770
00:42:19,694 --> 00:42:22,333
I've never seen you
turn down food before.

771
00:42:27,574 --> 00:42:29,565
So, what do you want, Alice?

772
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:32,772
You know what, I thought we'd wait till
after dinner to talk about that, Mama.

773
00:42:33,014 --> 00:42:35,972
And I thought you'd marry a lawyer.
Apparently, we both thought wrong.

774
00:42:37,814 --> 00:42:39,930
Oh, let me guess.
Do you need money?

775
00:42:40,774 --> 00:42:42,685
We wanna buy a house...
It's a duplex, actually.

776
00:42:42,934 --> 00:42:43,923
- With Ed and Trixie.

777
00:42:44,174 --> 00:42:47,962
Well, you know, truth be told,
buying a house is a big investment.

778
00:42:48,214 --> 00:42:49,932
Yeah, that is the truth.
That is the truth.

779
00:42:50,174 --> 00:42:52,404
- And it hurts, you know?
- I can see that.

780
00:42:52,854 --> 00:42:54,924
Never seen you so torn up
about money before.

781
00:42:55,174 --> 00:42:57,734
We are putting in all of our savings,
but we're still a little short.

782
00:42:57,974 --> 00:43:01,125
- About $10,000.
- Ten thousand dollars?

783
00:43:01,374 --> 00:43:03,171
Who do you think I am,
Weezy Jefferson?

784
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,291
God rest her soul.

785
00:43:05,534 --> 00:43:08,446
But it's a beautiful duplex, Mama,
with a back yard and everything.

786
00:43:08,934 --> 00:43:10,925
Right near the diner, even.

787
00:43:11,454 --> 00:43:12,443
So, what do you think?

788
00:43:12,694 --> 00:43:15,606
You should've married Larry Filmore.
He's taking over the funeral parlour.

789
00:43:18,454 --> 00:43:21,014
Just give me some time
to marinate on it.

790
00:43:21,254 --> 00:43:22,289
That's fair enough.

791
00:43:22,534 --> 00:43:24,445
Is something wrong with you?

792
00:43:24,694 --> 00:43:26,571
You know, it's just
that we've been so worried

793
00:43:26,814 --> 00:43:28,884
about asking you for the money
for the house,

794
00:43:29,134 --> 00:43:32,843
and, you know, sharing a meal over it
is just a beautiful thing.

795
00:43:33,094 --> 00:43:35,483
- I'm ready for dessert. Anybody?
- Yeah. Mama brought a pie.

796
00:43:35,734 --> 00:43:37,008
And Mama's gonna go get it.

797
00:43:37,254 --> 00:43:39,324
Mama's coming to the kitchen?

798
00:43:39,574 --> 00:43:42,566
- Your mama's going to the kitchen!
- Tell the truth,

799
00:43:42,814 --> 00:43:44,611
you're on the pipe, aren't you, boy?

800
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:51,373
There it is,
my famous apple crumble crisp pie.

801
00:43:57,414 --> 00:43:58,403
I don't even wanna know.

802
00:43:58,654 --> 00:43:59,973
Where do you keep
the paper towels?

803
00:44:00,214 --> 00:44:01,533
Oh, right up under the...

804
00:44:03,294 --> 00:44:06,411
We don't have any. We...
You know, I don't believe in that,

805
00:44:06,654 --> 00:44:08,212
with the rain forests and everything.

806
00:44:08,454 --> 00:44:11,252
You know, there's something
really, really wrong with you.

807
00:44:16,694 --> 00:44:18,685
- Where's the dog?
- He's right there.

808
00:44:22,974 --> 00:44:24,407
Look, we gotta go right now.

809
00:44:24,654 --> 00:44:26,929
They said if we don't get there by 9,
we can't even race.

810
00:44:27,174 --> 00:44:28,926
Well, they're not gonna
let me leave right now.

811
00:44:29,174 --> 00:44:31,369
Ralph, what are you doing?
Come join us for dessert.

812
00:44:31,614 --> 00:44:33,252
Okay, babe. I'll be in there
in just a second.

813
00:44:33,494 --> 00:44:35,485
The pilot light went out.

814
00:44:35,814 --> 00:44:38,806
He's fixing the pilot. He's handy.

815
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:40,169
How do we get out of here?

816
00:44:40,814 --> 00:44:42,566
Fire escape.

817
00:44:43,454 --> 00:44:44,443
Oh, hell, no.

818
00:44:44,694 --> 00:44:47,208
Boy, you coming in here or not?
My pie's getting stale.

819
00:44:47,734 --> 00:44:48,689
Damn.

820
00:44:49,734 --> 00:44:52,248
I got another riddle for you.
What's lighter than a feather,

821
00:44:52,494 --> 00:44:55,327
but yet the strongest man
can't hold it very long?

822
00:44:55,574 --> 00:44:58,088
Not now, Norton, okay? I'm trying
not to break my neck up here.

823
00:44:58,614 --> 00:45:00,286
Come on, Ralph. What's lighter
than a feather...?

824
00:45:00,534 --> 00:45:03,332
- Your breath.
- Wow, you a genius.

825
00:45:03,574 --> 00:45:05,405
- Ralph?
- Almost got it, babe.

826
00:45:05,654 --> 00:45:07,292
I'll be right there.

827
00:45:07,534 --> 00:45:09,172
Are you sure
this thing can hold us?

828
00:45:09,414 --> 00:45:12,406
We come down this
all the time, Ralph.

829
00:45:14,214 --> 00:45:15,169
Oh, man.

830
00:45:16,454 --> 00:45:18,445
Norton, you know I hate heights.

831
00:45:18,694 --> 00:45:20,286
Come on, Ralph. You can do it.

832
00:45:20,534 --> 00:45:22,365
Just chill, man. I'll help you.

833
00:45:23,214 --> 00:45:25,330
I can't, man. I ain't gonna be able
to do this, man.

834
00:45:25,574 --> 00:45:27,212
Ralph, you're gonna get us busted.

835
00:45:28,574 --> 00:45:30,132
Go slow.

836
00:45:31,054 --> 00:45:33,010
Hold on, Ralph. Come on, Ralph.

837
00:45:33,254 --> 00:45:34,323
What's the noise, man?

838
00:45:34,574 --> 00:45:36,326
Come on. Come on.

839
00:45:36,574 --> 00:45:38,326
I'm cool, right? I'm good.

840
00:45:38,574 --> 00:45:41,042
See, Ralph? It ain't that bad.

841
00:45:43,054 --> 00:45:44,089
Oh, Jesus.

842
00:45:50,854 --> 00:45:52,446
- You see anything?
- No.

843
00:45:52,694 --> 00:45:54,844
Now, where'd that crazy husband
of yours run off to?

844
00:45:55,094 --> 00:45:56,812
You know, I think he said
something about a meeting

845
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:58,089
at the lodge tonight.

846
00:46:00,654 --> 00:46:02,485
Oh, well, that's more dessert for us.

847
00:46:05,134 --> 00:46:09,047
Ralph, I gotta confess
something to you.

848
00:46:09,294 --> 00:46:10,852
- Just... Man, just hold on.
- We gonna die.

849
00:46:11,094 --> 00:46:13,403
I gotta get my life right with the Lord.

850
00:46:13,654 --> 00:46:16,168
One day, I was coming down there
to get some milk from y'all

851
00:46:16,414 --> 00:46:19,372
on the fire escape,
and I seen Alice naked.

852
00:46:20,494 --> 00:46:21,768
I ain't lying.

853
00:46:22,214 --> 00:46:25,012
And sometimes I think about it.

854
00:46:25,974 --> 00:46:27,089
You...!

855
00:46:40,774 --> 00:46:42,093
I forgot my keys.

856
00:46:42,334 --> 00:46:43,369
Yeah, right.

857
00:46:43,614 --> 00:46:45,332
Hey, I'm not gonna lie to you, man.

858
00:46:45,574 --> 00:46:47,804
I'm having problems, okay?
My wife left me.

859
00:46:48,054 --> 00:46:50,363
All right, technically, she's not my wife.
She's somebody else's.

860
00:46:50,614 --> 00:46:53,174
But the pain lingers all the same,
you know what I mean?

861
00:46:53,414 --> 00:46:55,006
Duck, duck!

862
00:46:55,254 --> 00:46:57,006
What you mean, "duck"?
What's going on?

863
00:46:58,494 --> 00:47:00,450
It's okay. It's all right.
No problem. He didn't see us.

864
00:47:00,694 --> 00:47:02,525
- Are we breaking in here?
- We're not breaking in.

865
00:47:02,774 --> 00:47:05,083
Why you profiling me, baby?
Why you profiling me?

866
00:47:05,334 --> 00:47:08,326
It's a competitive business. I don't
want other trainers to steal my secrets.

867
00:47:11,014 --> 00:47:11,969
Okay, fellas.

868
00:47:12,214 --> 00:47:15,650
Dog racing is about show business,
and the show counts.

869
00:47:15,894 --> 00:47:18,533
And it starts the minute
you walk your dog onto the battlefield.

870
00:47:18,774 --> 00:47:20,173
And this is the walk.

871
00:47:23,294 --> 00:47:25,012
Brisk. Brisk. Brisk.

872
00:47:25,254 --> 00:47:26,448
Arms down, arms down.

873
00:47:26,694 --> 00:47:28,730
Confidence. Don't be arrogant.
Don't be arrogant.

874
00:47:28,974 --> 00:47:31,852
It's not a tug of war.
It's not a tug of war.

875
00:47:32,094 --> 00:47:34,608
Watch out! Get the dog!
Get the dog! Get the dog!

876
00:47:36,254 --> 00:47:37,892
There you go. Good boy.

877
00:47:38,134 --> 00:47:40,170
He's great, man, great.
Sixty-five pounds.

878
00:47:40,414 --> 00:47:42,484
Less than 4 percent body fat.

879
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:44,247
All muscles. Yeah.

880
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:46,769
You know, I had a French aerobics
teacher. Leslie was her name.

881
00:47:47,014 --> 00:47:49,687
Just like that, really flexible,
except not enough soft places,

882
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:51,686
you know what I'm saying? Right?

883
00:47:54,094 --> 00:47:57,848
Okay, for lggy to be competitive,
he's gotta run at least a 32.30.

884
00:47:58,094 --> 00:47:59,322
This is the moment of truth, fellas.

885
00:47:59,574 --> 00:48:01,724
Ralph, Eddie, you ready?

886
00:48:01,974 --> 00:48:03,453
Three, two, one.

887
00:48:07,334 --> 00:48:08,847
All right, fellas.

888
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,732
We run into a couple problems.
Nothing minor.

889
00:48:11,254 --> 00:48:12,653
I gotta train his mind.

890
00:48:13,174 --> 00:48:14,926
That's it, lggy. Relax. Relax.

891
00:48:15,174 --> 00:48:16,129
That's it. Good boy.

892
00:48:16,374 --> 00:48:18,012
Breathe.

893
00:48:19,254 --> 00:48:21,404
Breathe. That's it.

894
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,968
You know, my parents find it
really difficult to explain to people

895
00:48:35,214 --> 00:48:37,125
what I do for a living.

896
00:48:37,574 --> 00:48:40,771
Iggy, you are one of
the most ancient canine breeds.

897
00:48:41,014 --> 00:48:44,086
The Pharaoh's favourite.
The Greek king's son.

898
00:48:44,334 --> 00:48:46,211
You're a born winner.
A born winner, boy.

899
00:48:46,454 --> 00:48:47,409
Live up to it.

900
00:48:54,534 --> 00:48:55,649
I don't know. I don't know.

901
00:48:57,694 --> 00:49:00,288
Listen to me, pooch.
Okay? I'm talking to you.

902
00:49:00,534 --> 00:49:02,252
Nobody quits on Tony Montana,
you hear me?

903
00:49:02,494 --> 00:49:06,043
You're a dog. It's a racetrack.

904
00:49:06,294 --> 00:49:07,932
You can win this thing.

905
00:49:08,174 --> 00:49:10,563
Iggy, baby, you listen to me.
I'm not who you think I am.

906
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:12,167
I'm not the best trainer in the world.

907
00:49:12,414 --> 00:49:14,609
I started out with nothing
and I still got most of it left.

908
00:49:14,854 --> 00:49:17,004
They wanted me to get you
pregnant by a pit bull.

909
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:19,893
Iggy, look at me
when I'm talking to you!

910
00:49:20,134 --> 00:49:22,170
Your dogs would've had
little bodies with big heads,

911
00:49:22,414 --> 00:49:24,405
just walking down the street
like this.

912
00:49:24,654 --> 00:49:28,124
You could have been a contender,
but instead you're a bum!

913
00:49:28,374 --> 00:49:32,287
You win the race, you get the power,
and then you get the bitches.

914
00:49:32,894 --> 00:49:34,486
Oh, yes, so many bitches.

915
00:49:40,934 --> 00:49:42,925
All right, fellas,
the dog's a straight-up dud.

916
00:49:43,174 --> 00:49:44,971
What? A dud?
Who you calling a dud?

917
00:49:45,214 --> 00:49:47,125
You're a trainer. Train the dog.

918
00:49:47,374 --> 00:49:49,524
- I've seen this dog move.
- I've seen him move too.

919
00:49:49,774 --> 00:49:51,651
You a dud. Iggy.

920
00:49:51,894 --> 00:49:53,885
Were you drinking at the time,
when you saw him move?

921
00:49:54,134 --> 00:49:56,409
Lggy, it's not that hard.

922
00:49:56,654 --> 00:49:58,406
Watch this.

923
00:49:59,934 --> 00:50:02,573
Let me think about it.
Let me just think, let me think.

924
00:50:04,054 --> 00:50:05,009
I got it. I got it.

925
00:50:05,254 --> 00:50:07,245
Why don't we Nancy Kerrigan
the other dogs.

926
00:50:07,494 --> 00:50:08,813
You mean hit the dogs
in the knee?

927
00:50:09,054 --> 00:50:10,487
No, just the back, the hind legs.

928
00:50:10,694 --> 00:50:11,649
- No.
- All right.

929
00:50:11,894 --> 00:50:13,486
Too aggressive for you?
Don't worry about it.

930
00:50:13,734 --> 00:50:15,486
- Vitamins?
- A little stronger than that.

931
00:50:15,734 --> 00:50:17,372
It works for me.
Nobody needs to know.

932
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:19,286
- They don't screen dogs.
- They don't?

933
00:50:19,534 --> 00:50:20,603
- No, no.
- Nobody needs to know.

934
00:50:20,854 --> 00:50:22,082
It's just between you and me.

935
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,452
- What'd you get?
- That was fast.

936
00:50:24,694 --> 00:50:26,605
Hey, nice lap, Norton.

937
00:50:27,094 --> 00:50:29,050
Eddie. Eddie, what do you think?

938
00:50:29,294 --> 00:50:32,172
I don't know how we gonna
get this dog to run.

939
00:50:50,574 --> 00:50:52,166
Check it out.

940
00:50:54,814 --> 00:50:57,009
Hey, boss. Check that out.

941
00:50:57,934 --> 00:50:59,526
You're impressed at it, ain't you?

942
00:51:00,254 --> 00:51:02,893
- He's in.
- Yeah!

943
00:51:03,414 --> 00:51:05,723
Assuming you have
all the proper paperwork.

944
00:51:05,974 --> 00:51:08,408
You bring it to the owners' party
here tomorrow night.

945
00:51:08,654 --> 00:51:10,849
Not a problem, Mr. Kirby.
We'll have that paperwork for you.

946
00:51:11,094 --> 00:51:13,164
We will definitely have
the paperwork tomorrow.

947
00:51:13,414 --> 00:51:15,245
- What paperwork?
- It's the dog's paperwork

948
00:51:15,494 --> 00:51:18,850
documenting authenticity of line,
license to race, proof of insurance,

949
00:51:19,094 --> 00:51:21,892
membership in the
Greyhound Association of Amer...

950
00:51:22,134 --> 00:51:23,249
All the things you ain't got.

951
00:51:23,494 --> 00:51:24,893
- We can get it.
- No, you can't.

952
00:51:25,134 --> 00:51:26,852
There's a three-week hold
on the license alone.

953
00:51:27,094 --> 00:51:28,049
- Damn.
- But you know what?

954
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:30,854
Because you're my friends,
I'll expedite it for $600,

955
00:51:31,094 --> 00:51:33,244
- and I'll get it to you by tomorrow.
- $600? No, no, no.

956
00:51:33,494 --> 00:51:37,282
You already charged us for the kennel,
the dog leash, $60 for Puppy Chow!

957
00:51:37,534 --> 00:51:39,490
That was Pedigree
Puppy Chow, man.

958
00:51:39,734 --> 00:51:42,373
- Come on.
- I got overhead. All right, $300.

959
00:51:46,374 --> 00:51:47,773
Excuse me.

960
00:51:48,014 --> 00:51:49,129
Are you the health inspector?

961
00:51:49,494 --> 00:51:50,893
Look, nice and clean. Spotless.

962
00:51:51,134 --> 00:51:53,170
No, no, no. I need to speak
to Alice Kramden, please.

963
00:51:53,414 --> 00:51:55,006
Oh, Alice is busy.

964
00:51:55,254 --> 00:51:56,448
Excuse me?

965
00:51:56,694 --> 00:51:58,013
Do you know who I am?

966
00:51:58,254 --> 00:52:00,688
No. No. You know who I am?

967
00:52:00,934 --> 00:52:03,323
I was born in a one-bedroom
farmhouse

968
00:52:03,574 --> 00:52:05,212
with five brothers, who I raised.

969
00:52:05,454 --> 00:52:08,685
I was born in China 88 years ago
in a Chinese rice field.

970
00:52:08,934 --> 00:52:09,969
I served my country in Vietnam,

971
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:13,126
where I was a Golden Gloves
champion three years running.

972
00:52:13,374 --> 00:52:15,126
Before when I come,
my English not good-looking,

973
00:52:15,374 --> 00:52:16,648
but now I speak perfect.

974
00:52:16,894 --> 00:52:19,328
I raised six kids.
Buried two husbands.

975
00:52:19,574 --> 00:52:21,724
And am on the lookout
for number three.

976
00:52:22,174 --> 00:52:23,368
Can I call you next week?

977
00:52:23,614 --> 00:52:24,569
What?

978
00:52:25,574 --> 00:52:28,134
- Mama, what are you doing here?
- Oh, hi, baby.

979
00:52:28,374 --> 00:52:32,447
I just thought
I'd drop this off in person.

980
00:52:33,494 --> 00:52:36,167
Thank you! Thank you!

981
00:52:36,414 --> 00:52:37,893
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

982
00:52:38,294 --> 00:52:40,808
Trix, we got the money
for the house!

983
00:52:41,054 --> 00:52:43,090
- I don't believe it.
- I didn't think you would do it.

984
00:52:43,334 --> 00:52:44,767
Well, I was sceptical.

985
00:52:45,014 --> 00:52:46,766
But Ralph seemed
so genuinely worried about it,

986
00:52:47,014 --> 00:52:49,323
I figured maybe he's
just coming around.

987
00:52:49,574 --> 00:52:51,690
- Yeah, maybe he is.
- Thank you, Mama!

988
00:52:51,934 --> 00:52:53,367
Oh, you're welcome.

989
00:53:01,174 --> 00:53:02,812
Once this is levelled,
it will make a nice entry

990
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:04,169
to the underground parking.

991
00:53:05,014 --> 00:53:06,129
Excuse me a moment.

992
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,333
Here to reconsider my offer?

993
00:53:09,574 --> 00:53:11,883
I'm actually here to give
Mrs. B some news.

994
00:53:12,134 --> 00:53:15,285
- Some really good news.
- Well, she's not here.

995
00:53:15,534 --> 00:53:17,843
- Please share it with me.
- I'd love to.

996
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:19,129
We're gonna own this place.

997
00:53:20,214 --> 00:53:24,173
Yeah. Ed and Trixie upstairs,
and me and Ralph down.

998
00:53:24,854 --> 00:53:28,051
- Ralph?
- Ralph, my husband.

999
00:53:28,894 --> 00:53:30,612
- What? What's so funny?
- I'm sorry.

1000
00:53:30,854 --> 00:53:34,210
It's just, you know, come Monday,
you'll be trespassing.

1001
00:53:37,574 --> 00:53:39,292
<i>Tell me this.</i>
<i>If there's no money in her account,</i>

1002
00:53:39,534 --> 00:53:41,843
then why is this waitress
hanging around my property?

1003
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:45,131
<i>Sir, I told you. I checked.</i>
<i>They have nothing.</i>

1004
00:53:45,374 --> 00:53:49,253
No, they've got something, Chip.
They've got something somewhere.

1005
00:53:49,494 --> 00:53:53,692
Find out what the husband is up to.
Ralph Kramden.

1006
00:53:56,054 --> 00:53:57,533
That woman I was telling you about?

1007
00:53:57,774 --> 00:54:01,892
Her name is Marlena.
She's Puerto Rican.

1008
00:54:02,134 --> 00:54:06,685
My God. I've tried to talk to her,
but words won't come.

1009
00:54:06,934 --> 00:54:08,492
I can tell you a thing or two
about women.

1010
00:54:08,734 --> 00:54:10,133
That's if you're ready to hear it.

1011
00:54:10,374 --> 00:54:12,934
It all begins with
letting her know who's boss.

1012
00:54:13,174 --> 00:54:14,926
Very important.

1013
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:19,524
Alice. What are you doing here?

1014
00:54:19,894 --> 00:54:21,088
I just came from the bank.

1015
00:54:21,334 --> 00:54:22,733
It's a funny story.
You wanna hear it?

1016
00:54:22,974 --> 00:54:24,612
Let her know who's boss, Ralph.

1017
00:54:25,334 --> 00:54:29,566
- Look, I can explain.
- Oh, can you? Can you, now?

1018
00:54:29,814 --> 00:54:31,770
I tell the bank
I wanna withdraw $4,000,

1019
00:54:32,014 --> 00:54:34,448
and they tell me
not only is our account empty,

1020
00:54:34,694 --> 00:54:38,573
but here's the punch line,
we're overdrawn by $223.60.

1021
00:54:38,814 --> 00:54:40,327
The bank said that?

1022
00:54:40,574 --> 00:54:42,371
No, no, there's gotta be
a mistake, baby.

1023
00:54:42,614 --> 00:54:45,082
Because I don't know nothing
about no 60 cents.

1024
00:54:45,534 --> 00:54:47,047
Where's the money, Ralph?

1025
00:54:47,894 --> 00:54:50,886
I can explain, all right?
But, you know,

1026
00:54:51,134 --> 00:54:53,523
taken out of context,
it might sound a little crazy.

1027
00:54:53,974 --> 00:54:54,929
Try me.

1028
00:54:58,014 --> 00:55:00,209
Norton and I found a train
in the sewer, see...

1029
00:55:00,454 --> 00:55:02,570
I want you out
of the apartment, Ralph.

1030
00:55:03,414 --> 00:55:05,052
Hold on. Babe, wait a minute.

1031
00:55:05,294 --> 00:55:07,649
Listen. Listen. And then we got
this dog out of the Dumpster...

1032
00:55:07,894 --> 00:55:09,566
I don't want to hear it!
I don't want to hear it.

1033
00:55:09,814 --> 00:55:11,008
- I'm done.
- Come on, baby.

1034
00:55:11,254 --> 00:55:12,607
Just 24 more hours, okay?

1035
00:55:12,854 --> 00:55:13,923
Twenty-four more hours,

1036
00:55:14,174 --> 00:55:16,688
and then we can get on
to the life we both dreamed of.

1037
00:55:16,934 --> 00:55:18,970
And what life is that, Ralph?

1038
00:55:19,574 --> 00:55:21,326
You've always been so obsessed
with your own dreams

1039
00:55:21,574 --> 00:55:24,407
- that you never bothered with mine.
- How can you say that?

1040
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,326
I want the house
just as much as you do.

1041
00:55:26,734 --> 00:55:28,770
Then why haven't you
been by to see it?

1042
00:55:29,654 --> 00:55:31,212
Because...

1043
00:55:32,694 --> 00:55:34,013
I mean...

1044
00:55:35,134 --> 00:55:37,011
Because you're selfish,
Ralph Kramden.

1045
00:55:37,974 --> 00:55:39,373
And I'm done playing the fool.

1046
00:55:46,534 --> 00:55:48,126
Come on, move it, all right?

1047
00:55:48,374 --> 00:55:50,205
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.

1048
00:55:50,454 --> 00:55:54,163
- Go ahead. Be my guest.
- The trouble is yours!

1049
00:56:20,654 --> 00:56:23,532
Luckily for me, man, I'm nearsighted,
so I can date just about anybody.

1050
00:56:23,774 --> 00:56:24,889
I understand what you're saying.

1051
00:56:25,134 --> 00:56:27,773
Like, I'm dating this lady right now,
she's about 40, 40-plus, whatever.

1052
00:56:28,014 --> 00:56:29,288
I don't wanna marry her
for her money,

1053
00:56:29,534 --> 00:56:32,571
but I don't know how else to get it,
you know what I'm saying?

1054
00:56:33,134 --> 00:56:35,011
You know, someday
I'm gonna find somebody special

1055
00:56:35,254 --> 00:56:37,324
who's not gonna press charges.
I'm telling you.

1056
00:56:37,614 --> 00:56:39,286
There he is. Finally.

1057
00:56:42,414 --> 00:56:43,483
Hey, keep it close.

1058
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,532
- Ralphie boy.
- Ralph, what are you wearing?

1059
00:56:46,734 --> 00:56:47,689
This is a A-list party.

1060
00:56:47,934 --> 00:56:50,243
You got D-list all over you, man.
Look at me.

1061
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:52,883
I'm wearing new underwear, even.
Well, they're new to me, anyway.

1062
00:56:53,134 --> 00:56:55,125
Look, I couldn't change.
Alice kicked me out the house.

1063
00:56:55,374 --> 00:56:57,683
- Again?
- She found out about the money.

1064
00:56:57,934 --> 00:57:00,129
And madder than a mug
about the house.

1065
00:57:00,374 --> 00:57:02,046
- It's serious.
- Don't worry about it, Ralph.

1066
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:04,125
Tomorrow, when lggy's
in that winner's circle,

1067
00:57:04,374 --> 00:57:07,446
we gonna get paid, and the money
will buy the girls the house.

1068
00:57:07,694 --> 00:57:10,845
Yeah, maybe you're right.
You got the paperwork for Kirby?

1069
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,085
I never disappoint, because
I'm always on point, baby.

1070
00:57:13,334 --> 00:57:14,403
Then let's do this, man.

1071
00:57:14,774 --> 00:57:17,766
Ralph, they're not gonna let you in
dressed like a thug.

1072
00:57:18,014 --> 00:57:19,493
What thug drives a bus?

1073
00:57:19,734 --> 00:57:21,486
Besides, where am I gonna
find a suit at this hour?

1074
00:57:27,014 --> 00:57:30,006
Man, Ralph, you're looking
real Temptation-like in that suit.

1075
00:57:30,254 --> 00:57:33,291
I know you ain't trying to jone,
looking like the last Blues Brother.

1076
00:57:33,534 --> 00:57:35,252
Man, you look great,
like a plucked sunflower.

1077
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:36,483
Girls love flowers, man.

1078
00:57:36,734 --> 00:57:38,565
You know, I love all your stuff.

1079
00:57:38,814 --> 00:57:40,008
I really, really do.

1080
00:57:40,254 --> 00:57:41,926
What stuff is she
talking about, Ralph?

1081
00:57:42,174 --> 00:57:43,129
I have no idea.

1082
00:57:43,374 --> 00:57:44,602
You guys are great.

1083
00:57:44,854 --> 00:57:45,969
Looking forward to it.

1084
00:57:46,214 --> 00:57:48,523
- What is going on here, man?
- They must know we own lggy.

1085
00:57:48,774 --> 00:57:50,730
I'm telling you,
that dog's a winner, Ralph.

1086
00:57:50,974 --> 00:57:52,930
- Whatever. Let's find Kirby.
- Right, right, right.

1087
00:57:54,694 --> 00:57:56,446
You kill me.

1088
00:57:56,694 --> 00:57:58,047
Hey, Mr. Kirby. How are you?

1089
00:57:58,294 --> 00:57:59,647
Well...

1090
00:57:59,894 --> 00:58:03,011
I'm fine. I'm fine. Mr. Kramden,

1091
00:58:03,254 --> 00:58:04,687
that is quite a suit.

1092
00:58:04,934 --> 00:58:05,923
You dig that suit, huh?

1093
00:58:06,174 --> 00:58:08,972
It would suit you, but unfortunately
I'm out of the banana. I got pumpkin.

1094
00:58:09,334 --> 00:58:11,006
Pumpkin? You didn't say nothing
about no pumpkin.

1095
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:13,722
Mr. Kirby, I got the paperwork
for lggy to be in the race tomorrow.

1096
00:58:13,974 --> 00:58:16,613
Iggy won't be in the race tomorrow.
He's been scratched.

1097
00:58:16,854 --> 00:58:19,004
- Scratched? What do you mean?
- Scratched? Man, what the...?

1098
00:58:19,254 --> 00:58:21,404
I bribed the top people.
I was in procedure

1099
00:58:21,654 --> 00:58:23,007
to get this through. Come on.

1100
00:58:23,254 --> 00:58:24,812
I'll be perfectly honest with you.

1101
00:58:25,054 --> 00:58:28,763
You see, my new friend over there
has just paid a good amount of cash

1102
00:58:29,014 --> 00:58:30,606
to keep your dog out of the race.

1103
00:58:30,854 --> 00:58:32,128
Here we go.

1104
00:58:32,374 --> 00:58:33,568
Wait a minute. Who is this guy?

1105
00:58:33,814 --> 00:58:36,533
William Davis.
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

1106
00:58:36,774 --> 00:58:37,968
No, we haven't had the pleasure,

1107
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:41,809
because if we had been pleasured,
I think we'd have knowed about it.

1108
00:58:43,694 --> 00:58:46,049
- Better if you don't talk, man.
- Davis.

1109
00:58:47,334 --> 00:58:49,723
- "Davis Properties" Davis?
- That's right.

1110
00:58:49,974 --> 00:58:51,407
That's the one
Trixie was talking about.

1111
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:53,804
And you are...?

1112
00:58:55,294 --> 00:58:57,125
Ralph Kramden.

1113
00:58:57,374 --> 00:58:58,648
Oh, yes.

1114
00:58:58,894 --> 00:59:00,691
Well, it's just business.

1115
00:59:00,934 --> 00:59:02,731
Nothing personal .

1116
00:59:05,134 --> 00:59:07,011
How's it just pers...?
It's just business?

1117
00:59:07,254 --> 00:59:11,645
And since our business is over,
why don't you stay, enjoy the buffet

1118
00:59:11,894 --> 00:59:13,612
- and buy yourselves some drinks.
- You wrong, man.

1119
00:59:13,854 --> 00:59:16,607
- Come on, Mr. Kirby. We got...
- Boss, it's me. Boss, talk to me, baby.

1120
00:59:17,214 --> 00:59:18,727
That was a police move, man.

1121
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:19,969
Let it go. Let it go.

1122
00:59:20,214 --> 00:59:21,852
- What do you mean?
- Just let it go.

1123
00:59:22,094 --> 00:59:24,654
I'm sitting here like a rubber ducky,
and you talking about, "Let it go."

1124
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,567
Come on, let's have a little
free punch. It's on me.

1125
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,805
Lighten things up a little bit,
because I've been thinking

1126
00:59:30,054 --> 00:59:31,328
and thinking and...

1127
00:59:31,574 --> 00:59:33,963
- And it doesn't look good.
- And it doesn't smell good.

1128
00:59:34,214 --> 00:59:37,126
Them shrimps got me
with the bubble-guts.

1129
00:59:37,374 --> 00:59:38,329
Look, Ralph. Ralph.

1130
00:59:38,574 --> 00:59:40,132
You can't be hating on Kirby, man.
You can't.

1131
00:59:40,374 --> 00:59:43,093
He's a self-made businessman,
just like you and me, you know?

1132
00:59:43,334 --> 00:59:46,132
He started out with $5,000, and now
he's 2 or $3 million in debt.

1133
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:48,046
You gotta admire that.
Now, I ain't got no taste,

1134
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:49,522
but I gotta admire that, you know?

1135
00:59:49,774 --> 00:59:51,127
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Ralph,

1136
00:59:51,374 --> 00:59:52,773
but sometimes the world
is cold like that.

1137
00:59:53,014 --> 00:59:54,049
It is about money sometimes.

1138
00:59:54,294 --> 00:59:56,364
Yeah. It's about money.

1139
00:59:56,894 --> 00:59:58,532
Look at Kirby.
If he thought for one second

1140
00:59:58,774 --> 01:00:02,449
he can get paid with lggy,
we wouldn't even be in this situation.

1141
01:00:02,694 --> 01:00:04,650
I have been looking
everywhere for you two.

1142
01:00:04,894 --> 01:00:06,247
- Come on.
- What's going on?

1143
01:00:06,494 --> 01:00:08,212
- We're late. Come on.
- Late for what?

1144
01:00:08,454 --> 01:00:10,126
- Who do you think we are?
- Come on, Chang.

1145
01:00:10,374 --> 01:00:11,648
Everyone knows your yellow suit.

1146
01:00:11,894 --> 01:00:13,850
- Chang?
- I'm excited to finally meet you.

1147
01:00:14,094 --> 01:00:16,403
How many times I told you
not to call this number, huh?

1148
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,007
Yeah. Why?
Why you gonna call the cops?

1149
01:00:18,254 --> 01:00:19,653
Why call the cops?
I was gonna be there.

1150
01:00:19,894 --> 01:00:22,408
I'll give you the money
on Friday, right? Mom. Mom.

1151
01:00:22,654 --> 01:00:24,804
You were supposed to start
five minutes ago.

1152
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:26,692
Get up there.

1153
01:00:26,934 --> 01:00:27,969
- What the...?
- Now, remember.

1154
01:00:28,214 --> 01:00:29,613
You're getting paid per set.

1155
01:00:29,854 --> 01:00:32,004
Okay. Go on.

1156
01:00:32,574 --> 01:00:34,405
Well, she said we was getting paid.

1157
01:00:34,654 --> 01:00:35,643
Go on ahead.

1158
01:00:44,694 --> 01:00:46,047
Hey.

1159
01:00:46,774 --> 01:00:48,571
- I have an idea.
- What kind of idea?

1160
01:00:48,814 --> 01:00:50,611
Just follow my lead.

1161
01:00:50,854 --> 01:00:52,207
It's gonna be great.

1162
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:53,889
Test. Testing.

1163
01:00:54,254 --> 01:00:55,687
Oh, yeah. This is great.
This is great.

1164
01:00:55,934 --> 01:00:58,050
One, two, three. Oh, yeah.

1165
01:00:58,294 --> 01:00:59,283
Everybody follow me.

1166
01:00:59,534 --> 01:01:00,887
How are you, my man?
Good seeing you.

1167
01:01:01,134 --> 01:01:02,806
This is some party, don't you think?

1168
01:01:03,054 --> 01:01:05,329
Beautiful people here this evening.

1169
01:01:05,574 --> 01:01:06,609
Hey. Listen.

1170
01:01:07,094 --> 01:01:09,403
How many dreamers,
by a show of hands, do we have?

1171
01:01:09,814 --> 01:01:11,725
Where are the dreamers?
All the dreamers?

1172
01:01:12,694 --> 01:01:14,412
All around there, there's dreamers.

1173
01:01:14,654 --> 01:01:15,609
I'm a dreamer.

1174
01:01:16,054 --> 01:01:17,089
Hey. The dog.

1175
01:01:18,814 --> 01:01:20,452
Get the dog.

1176
01:01:23,734 --> 01:01:25,690
- Right. I got it. I got it, baby.
- Yes. The dog.

1177
01:01:25,934 --> 01:01:29,244
I got this one. Yeah, l...
You almost got me.

1178
01:01:29,494 --> 01:01:31,405
Well, I, too, am a dreamer.

1179
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:33,884
And I had a dream
that my dog would race

1180
01:01:34,134 --> 01:01:35,965
on this beautiful track
tomorrow afternoon.

1181
01:01:36,214 --> 01:01:37,533
But that dream just won't happen,

1182
01:01:37,774 --> 01:01:41,244
because our dog has been scratched
due to financial technicalities.

1183
01:02:02,174 --> 01:02:04,608
Eddie "Left Hands" Norton,
everybody. Wow.

1184
01:02:07,214 --> 01:02:08,932
What a surprise that is.

1185
01:02:09,174 --> 01:02:10,493
And you don't know the half of it.

1186
01:02:10,934 --> 01:02:13,448
But Eddie's beautiful music
only underscores the fact

1187
01:02:13,694 --> 01:02:15,844
that my dog has been scratched.

1188
01:02:16,294 --> 01:02:18,125
Scratched on paper,

1189
01:02:18,374 --> 01:02:19,773
but not scratched in spirit.

1190
01:02:19,974 --> 01:02:20,929
Yeah.

1191
01:02:21,174 --> 01:02:23,005
And then...
And this man, Dodge.

1192
01:02:23,254 --> 01:02:25,722
This is Dodge, our trainer, and...
Come on.

1193
01:02:25,974 --> 01:02:28,932
This is Dodge and our dog, lggy.

1194
01:02:29,174 --> 01:02:32,450
And I know to look at him,
sure, he looks a little mangy

1195
01:02:32,694 --> 01:02:34,730
and sickly looking
and in need of a bath,

1196
01:02:34,974 --> 01:02:38,364
but I tell you, lggy's a special dog.

1197
01:02:38,614 --> 01:02:41,174
You know, we found lggy
in a Dumpster.

1198
01:02:41,414 --> 01:02:42,688
Damn near dead.

1199
01:02:42,934 --> 01:02:45,767
Hadn't eaten in days,
but like most underdogs,

1200
01:02:46,014 --> 01:02:47,333
lggy's a survivor.

1201
01:02:47,574 --> 01:02:50,532
Like Seabiscuit, Rocky,
Destiny's Child.

1202
01:02:50,774 --> 01:02:51,843
All survivors.

1203
01:02:52,094 --> 01:02:53,891
You know, I guess
I'm just saying this to say that,

1204
01:02:54,134 --> 01:02:56,648
Mr. Kirby, I don't know why
you're not letting our dog

1205
01:02:56,894 --> 01:03:00,091
race tomorrow, but he's
already a winner in my book.

1206
01:03:00,334 --> 01:03:03,849
And I'll put money on my
Dumpster dog any day of the week.

1207
01:03:04,094 --> 01:03:05,812
- Yeah!
- Any day, Ralph.

1208
01:03:06,054 --> 01:03:08,249
- So would I!
- Me too.

1209
01:03:10,374 --> 01:03:12,126
You're not buying
any of this crap, are you?

1210
01:03:12,374 --> 01:03:14,763
A homeless Dumpster dog,
you're kidding.

1211
01:03:15,014 --> 01:03:18,086
People are gonna be falling
all over themselves betting on him.

1212
01:03:18,334 --> 01:03:19,483
Mr. Davis, I'm sorry.

1213
01:03:19,734 --> 01:03:22,931
- If that dog wins, I'm screwed.
- That dog will never win.

1214
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:24,846
You'll see for yourself.

1215
01:03:25,094 --> 01:03:26,891
Mr. Kramden.

1216
01:03:27,134 --> 01:03:29,250
Iggy, he's in!

1217
01:03:29,534 --> 01:03:30,762
- Yes!
- He's in!

1218
01:03:31,014 --> 01:03:32,652
Bet on lggy.

1219
01:03:34,454 --> 01:03:36,604
Bet on lggy. Iggy.

1220
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:39,322
Excuse me. Excuse me.
What's going on here?

1221
01:03:39,574 --> 01:03:42,008
Who are they? It's my piano.

1222
01:03:42,254 --> 01:03:46,372
<i>Iggy! Lggy! Lggy!</i>

1223
01:03:55,174 --> 01:03:57,165
Ralph Kramden, if you think
you can just waltz in here

1224
01:03:57,414 --> 01:03:59,723
and everything's gonna be fine,
you have another...

1225
01:04:01,014 --> 01:04:03,164
It's you guys. And that dog.

1226
01:04:04,654 --> 01:04:05,769
What's going on?

1227
01:04:06,014 --> 01:04:07,333
Ed's got quite a story.

1228
01:04:07,574 --> 01:04:09,485
He wants you to hear it.

1229
01:04:29,414 --> 01:04:31,882
- Hey, he won't be up there.
- Who?

1230
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:33,726
Dodge. That's who
you're looking for, right?

1231
01:04:33,974 --> 01:04:35,692
Oh, sure, exactly. Dodge, yeah.

1232
01:04:35,934 --> 01:04:37,606
Oh, there he is.
Hey, Dodge!

1233
01:04:37,854 --> 01:04:38,889
Dodge.

1234
01:04:39,134 --> 01:04:41,694
Hey. Hey, guys.
What's up? How you doing?

1235
01:04:41,934 --> 01:04:43,765
You probably thought I was
stealing his wallet, right?

1236
01:04:44,014 --> 01:04:45,891
Well, no. We're friends.
We do it all the time.

1237
01:04:46,134 --> 01:04:48,773
Yeah. Lonnie. Lonnie.
Hey, tag. You're it, man.

1238
01:04:49,014 --> 01:04:50,606
See you at the barbecue
next weekend.

1239
01:04:50,854 --> 01:04:52,810
Damn. Look at you fellas, man.

1240
01:04:53,054 --> 01:04:55,443
You look macking, packing,
black-a-doscious.

1241
01:04:55,654 --> 01:04:56,609
Your first race.

1242
01:04:56,854 --> 01:04:58,492
You know, if lggy wins
that first heat, man,

1243
01:04:58,734 --> 01:05:00,565
we're gonna go for the real money
in the second race.

1244
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:02,042
Now, go up. I'm gonna take lggy.

1245
01:05:02,294 --> 01:05:04,012
I want you to go
to the owners' booth, all right?

1246
01:05:04,254 --> 01:05:06,484
Go up into the box up there.
Enjoy yourselves. Don't be nervous.

1247
01:05:06,734 --> 01:05:08,452
Get your popcorn.

1248
01:05:08,694 --> 01:05:10,844
Get your popcorn here.

1249
01:05:11,094 --> 01:05:12,447
Hey, popcorn.

1250
01:05:12,694 --> 01:05:14,491
- What are you looking for?
- I'm just...

1251
01:05:14,734 --> 01:05:17,123
Where is that popcorn man?

1252
01:05:18,254 --> 01:05:20,210
She's not coming, Norton.

1253
01:05:20,454 --> 01:05:21,807
I know you tried.

1254
01:05:22,054 --> 01:05:23,806
- You my boy.
- Yeah.

1255
01:05:24,054 --> 01:05:25,487
Yeah, man. It's okay.

1256
01:05:26,854 --> 01:05:29,687
- Should we go down there?
- No. No, Trix, I'm not ready yet.

1257
01:05:29,934 --> 01:05:32,164
- Are you waiting to see if he wins?
- No.

1258
01:05:32,414 --> 01:05:34,405
I'm waiting to see if he loses.

1259
01:05:34,734 --> 01:05:35,689
I know it'll kill him.

1260
01:05:35,934 --> 01:05:39,483
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, it's post time</i>

- Yes!

1269
01:06:23,614 --> 01:06:25,605
- <i>With a time of 31.5.</i>
- We gonna get that money.

1270
01:06:25,854 --> 01:06:27,367
We on our way, baby.

1271
01:06:27,894 --> 01:06:30,044
- That dog is unbeatable.
- Don't worry about it.

1272
01:06:30,294 --> 01:06:31,647
That was just the first heat.

1273
01:06:31,894 --> 01:06:34,567
The final is a whole different
ball game.

1274
01:06:34,814 --> 01:06:36,133
That puts him in the race
for the money?

1275
01:06:36,374 --> 01:06:38,410
Yeah. Yeah. Only Ralph.

1276
01:06:38,654 --> 01:06:41,293
Our future depends on a dog race.

1277
01:06:42,134 --> 01:06:43,613
I didn't... I didn't sleep with her.

1278
01:06:43,854 --> 01:06:45,492
I just loaned her 10K
for plastic surgery.

1279
01:06:45,734 --> 01:06:48,453
Now I don't even know what she
looks like, all right? All right. Peace.

1280
01:06:48,694 --> 01:06:51,367
Yo, fellas. He's as ready
as he's ever gonna be now.

1281
01:06:51,614 --> 01:06:53,730
Come on, lg. We gotta review
our strategy, baby.

1282
01:06:54,134 --> 01:06:55,613
Norton, it's a dog.

1283
01:06:55,814 --> 01:06:56,769
Ralph, stop hating.

1284
01:06:57,014 --> 01:06:59,005
I'm trying to get lggy
to visualise his success.

1285
01:06:59,254 --> 01:07:01,814
Well, you get him to visualise
going back to that Dumpster.

1286
01:07:02,054 --> 01:07:04,363
That'll give him something
to think about.

1287
01:07:08,694 --> 01:07:10,650
I'm sorry, guys. Nerves.

1288
01:07:10,894 --> 01:07:12,327
Iggy's got this one
in the bag, Ralph.

1289
01:07:12,574 --> 01:07:14,132
I don't know, fellas.
I don't know, man.

1290
01:07:14,374 --> 01:07:16,171
This race is a lot tougher
than you guys think.

1291
01:07:16,414 --> 01:07:17,893
Oh, man. There you go, hating.

1292

Iggy is gonna...
Them other dogs ain't... Damn.

1293
01:07:23,334 --> 01:07:25,325
That ain't a damn dog.
That's a horse.

1294
01:07:25,574 --> 01:07:27,724
Welcome to the big time, fellas.
Welcome to the big time.

1295
01:07:27,974 --> 01:07:31,683
Come on, lggy.
If you win that race, you get this.

1296
01:07:35,654 --> 01:07:36,609
What do you think?

1297
01:07:36,854 --> 01:07:38,685
Let's not jinx him.
Let's just see him after the race.

1298
01:07:38,934 --> 01:07:41,494
- After they win the money?
- Let's hope.

What were you thinking,
distracting him like that?

1321
01:09:21,134 --> 01:09:22,613
I was just trying
to encourage him, Ralph.

1322
01:09:22,854 --> 01:09:24,048
You encouraged him, all right.

1323

I thought we were boys, man.

No, no. We're not boys.
We're not friends.

off your hands.

...the price has gone up
considerably.

postage, handling.

- What is your price?

- Twenty-five thousand.
- Twenty-five thousand?

1356
01:12:18,054 --> 01:12:21,330
Okay. That was too much.
Okay, 20,000.

1357
01:12:22,934 --> 01:12:24,208
Twenty thousand will be fine.

1358
01:12:27,094 --> 01:12:28,652
I'm gonna need a check right now.

- Ralph Kramden. What's going on?

1360
01:12:45,534 --> 01:12:47,013
- What, are you in trouble?
- Look.

1361

Man, I gotta get to Q's Diner
by 9 a.m.

1362
01:12:49,334 --> 01:12:51,165
- You go that way, right?
- Not by 9 a.m.

1363
01:12:51,414 --> 01:12:54,406
I mean, look at it.
It's, like, total gridlock.

1364
01:12:56,854 --> 01:12:57,809
Hello, hello, hello?

1365
01:12:58,054 --> 01:12:59,885
Hey, Q, it's Ralph Kramden.

1366
01:13:00,134 --> 01:13:02,250
- <i>Alice's husband. Is she</i>...<i>?</i>
- Oh, no. She's not here.

1367
01:13:02,494 --> 01:13:04,246
No. I got the check for the house.
I'm trying...

1368
01:13:04,494 --> 01:13:06,962
- Please, the health inspector here.
- <i>Health inspector?</i>

1369
01:13:07,214 --> 01:13:08,886
Don't hang up, you...

1370
01:13:09,294 --> 01:13:11,046
I gotta get over there.

1371
01:13:11,654 --> 01:13:15,169
Welcome to your new positions
in the New York City sewer system.

1372
01:13:15,414 --> 01:13:17,609
Today, you will join an elite group
of dedicated

1373
01:13:17,854 --> 01:13:19,367
and dependable professionals.

1374
01:13:19,614 --> 01:13:22,970
You lucky few have survived
a rigorous application process,

1375
01:13:23,214 --> 01:13:25,409
interviews
and psychological profiles.

1376
01:13:25,654 --> 01:13:28,612
Actually, Ed, these are all convicted
felons of violent crimes

1377
01:13:28,854 --> 01:13:31,687
taking part in
a work-release program.

1378
01:13:33,014 --> 01:13:35,448
And since there are no questions...

1379
01:13:35,694 --> 01:13:37,764
I got one for you.

1380
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:41,409
Two men are born five blocks apart.

1381
01:13:41,654 --> 01:13:43,645
They've been best friends
for 30 years,

1382
01:13:43,894 --> 01:13:48,285
until one of them says some
really stupid things he didn't mean.

1383
01:13:48,534 --> 01:13:50,490
How does he get the other guy
to forgive him?

1384
01:13:50,734 --> 01:13:52,929
I'm not the one who's good
at riddles, remember, Ralph?

1385
01:13:53,654 --> 01:13:54,723
Neither am I.

1386
01:13:54,974 --> 01:13:56,202
What are you talking about?

1387
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:01,404
You know that book of riddles
you keep on your coffee table?

1388
01:14:03,014 --> 01:14:06,609
I found it, got me a copy
and memorised it.

1389
01:14:06,854 --> 01:14:08,765
You mean to tell me...?

1390
01:14:10,134 --> 01:14:12,807
Look, Norton.

1391
01:14:13,694 --> 01:14:14,649
Norton.

1392
01:14:15,094 --> 01:14:17,483
- Come on. Norton.
- What, Ralph? What? What?

1393
01:14:17,814 --> 01:14:20,612
You always thought
I was the smart one.

1394
01:14:21,014 --> 01:14:22,333
And if you ever
stopped thinking that,

1395
01:14:22,574 --> 01:14:25,805
then I don't know
what I would be anymore.

1396
01:14:29,334 --> 01:14:30,847
You really mean that, Ralph?

1397
01:14:32,374 --> 01:14:33,363
Yeah.

1398
01:14:33,614 --> 01:14:34,729
I'm sorry.

1399
01:14:37,574 --> 01:14:40,168
Hey, come on, Ed.
Don't start, man. When you...

1400
01:14:40,414 --> 01:14:41,972
Why you come down here
and make me cry

1401
01:14:42,214 --> 01:14:43,613
in front of all these convicts
like this?

1402
01:14:43,814 --> 01:14:44,769
Stop it, man.

1403
01:14:45,014 --> 01:14:48,086
I'm trying to just say
what I gotta say.

1404
01:14:48,294 --> 01:14:49,249
- Look, hey.
- Yeah.

1405
01:14:49,494 --> 01:14:50,688
- Look, man.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1406
01:14:50,934 --> 01:14:52,925
- You know what I'm saying?
- Do I have a tear in my eye?

1407
01:14:53,174 --> 01:14:54,493
No. You okay.

1408
01:14:54,734 --> 01:14:56,008
Look, this doesn't change
everything.

1409
01:14:56,254 --> 01:14:58,051
We still have issues
between each other.

1410
01:14:58,294 --> 01:14:59,966
Look. Okay. I understand that.

1411
01:15:00,214 --> 01:15:02,125
- But I got the money for the house.
- You did?

1412
01:15:02,374 --> 01:15:04,330
But I gotta get the check
to the diner before 9 a.m.,

1413
01:15:04,574 --> 01:15:06,007
and it's total gridlock up there.

1414
01:15:06,254 --> 01:15:08,893
I need someone who knows
the city beneath the city.

1415
01:15:09,134 --> 01:15:10,692
I need a specialist.

1416
01:15:10,934 --> 01:15:12,049
I need you, Ed.

1417
01:15:14,934 --> 01:15:16,208
I got you.

1418
01:15:16,814 --> 01:15:18,452
But I have conditions.

1419
01:15:18,694 --> 01:15:21,367
Condition number one,
you gotta start letting me pick stuff.

1420
01:15:21,614 --> 01:15:22,569
What are you talking about?

1421
01:15:22,814 --> 01:15:24,213
You always get to pick
the restaurants.

1422
01:15:24,454 --> 01:15:25,569
You always get to pick
the movies.

1423
01:15:25,814 --> 01:15:27,486
That's because
if we let you pick stuff,

1424
01:15:27,734 --> 01:15:30,089
nothing would ever get decided.

1425
01:15:36,134 --> 01:15:37,886
Fine! You can pick stuff.

1426
01:15:40,174 --> 01:15:42,130
Second up,
when we get around new people,

1427
01:15:42,374 --> 01:15:44,649
you have to start
referring to me as "Edward."

1428
01:15:47,334 --> 01:15:49,325
Only you would pick
a shortcut like this.

1429
01:15:49,574 --> 01:15:52,452
That's another one.
You gotta stop making fun of me.

1430
01:15:52,774 --> 01:15:56,483
I'll admit, the way I do things
is a little unorthodox, but that's me.

1431
01:15:56,734 --> 01:15:58,531
The way you do things
is ridiculous.

1432
01:15:58,774 --> 01:16:00,730
Oh, I'm the one
who looks ridiculous?

1433
01:16:00,974 --> 01:16:02,123
Yeah.

1434
01:16:06,734 --> 01:16:08,770
- That ain't even funny.
- Oh, yes, it is.

1435
01:16:09,014 --> 01:16:10,732
We gotta go. Come on, let's ride.

1436
01:16:13,294 --> 01:16:16,172
Okay, Ralph.
This is the big one.

1437
01:16:16,414 --> 01:16:18,245
You gotta promise to me
that you will never yell at me

1438
01:16:18,494 --> 01:16:20,883
or get mad at me
ever, ever again.

1439
01:16:21,134 --> 01:16:23,090
- Done.
- Put it on your family jewels.

1440
01:16:23,334 --> 01:16:24,528
Put it on my family...?

1441
01:16:24,774 --> 01:16:28,653
Fine. I put it on my family jewels
that I will never get mad

1442
01:16:28,894 --> 01:16:30,771
or holler at you again.

1443
01:16:31,014 --> 01:16:32,572
Good, because we're lost.

1444
01:16:32,814 --> 01:16:33,929
You...!

1445
01:16:35,734 --> 01:16:36,962
Family jewels.

1446
01:16:37,214 --> 01:16:38,567
So...

1447
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:40,407
...Edward.

1448
01:16:40,654 --> 01:16:42,884
How do you suggest
we proceed from here?

1449
01:16:43,134 --> 01:16:44,362
Well, there's two ways
we can go.

1450
01:16:44,614 --> 01:16:46,684
Either that way or that way.

1451
01:16:47,374 --> 01:16:48,932
Why don't we let you pick.

1452
01:16:49,334 --> 01:16:51,768
Let me pick? That's my man.
That's what I'm talking about.

1453
01:16:52,854 --> 01:16:53,809
Which way?

1454
01:16:54,614 --> 01:16:56,093
That way.

1455
01:16:59,814 --> 01:17:01,691
It's this way, Ralph.

1456
01:17:04,574 --> 01:17:06,644
- This should be it. Straight up.
- Let's hope.

1457
01:17:13,174 --> 01:17:15,449
Hey, Norton, this is it!
You my man, dog.

1458
01:17:29,814 --> 01:17:31,452
Ralph, what are you waiting for?

1459
01:17:32,374 --> 01:17:34,046
There's an SUV
on the manhole cover.

1460
01:17:34,574 --> 01:17:36,246
You yelling, Ralph.

1461
01:17:36,494 --> 01:17:38,450
This way is blocked,
and it's Davis.

1462
01:17:38,694 --> 01:17:40,605
Okay. Another manhole
two blocks down.

1463
01:17:41,814 --> 01:17:43,691
- Watch it.
- You think we're too late?

1464
01:17:43,934 --> 01:17:46,084
Not if she hasn't signed yet.

1465
01:17:48,534 --> 01:17:49,489
You don't have to read it.

1466
01:17:52,214 --> 01:17:53,613
Oh, glad you two made up.

1467
01:17:53,854 --> 01:17:57,244
But Alice isn't here, Ralph. She didn't
wanna stick around and watch that.

1468
01:17:58,334 --> 01:17:59,369
Ma'am, don't sign that!

1469
01:18:01,574 --> 01:18:03,485
- That's no good.
- That's good.

1470
01:18:04,014 --> 01:18:05,766
- Miss Benvenuti.
- Oh, no. Don't put that down.

1471
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:07,606
You can't stop once you've started.

1472
01:18:07,854 --> 01:18:09,606
It's... It's unethical.

1473
01:18:09,854 --> 01:18:11,207
I'm Ralph Kramden,
Alice's husband.

1474
01:18:11,414 --> 01:18:12,369
- And...
- Please.

1475
01:18:12,614 --> 01:18:13,763
Well, this is...

1476
01:18:14,014 --> 01:18:15,413
- Mr. Q?
- It's a little wet.

1477
01:18:15,654 --> 01:18:18,691
It's dirty. But maybe we can
blow-dry it off and do whatever.

1478
01:18:18,934 --> 01:18:20,606
But, well, it's for you.

1479
01:18:20,974 --> 01:18:22,692
I'll take the check as is.

1480
01:18:23,054 --> 01:18:25,773
- Okay, great.
- Okay. Everyone just...

1481
01:18:26,094 --> 01:18:28,688
Look. I'll give you
even more, all right?

1482
01:18:29,174 --> 01:18:30,607
- Thank you.
- You got it.

1483
01:18:30,854 --> 01:18:32,765
But I don't think so.

1484
01:18:33,014 --> 01:18:35,289
I'd rather have my house
remain a home.

1485
01:18:35,534 --> 01:18:38,094
Yeah. Thank you, Miss Benvenuti.
Thank you.

1486
01:18:38,334 --> 01:18:41,326
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. Kramden.

1487
01:18:41,574 --> 01:18:43,292
It's a pleasure doing
business with you.

1488
01:18:43,534 --> 01:18:45,331
- Oh, no. Thank you.
- You can't do this to me.

1489
01:18:45,814 --> 01:18:47,293
Nobody's doing anything to you.

1490
01:18:47,894 --> 01:18:49,691
This is business. It's not personal.

1491
01:18:55,254 --> 01:18:57,370
Miss Benvenuti, we'll be calling you.

1492
01:18:57,614 --> 01:18:58,888
All right.

1493
01:19:51,134 --> 01:19:54,444
- Ralph.
- Just give me a second, okay?

1494
01:19:57,614 --> 01:19:59,172
Alice,

1495
01:19:59,494 --> 01:20:01,132
I've wasted so much time.

1496
01:20:01,854 --> 01:20:04,414
Made so many bad choices.

1497
01:20:05,974 --> 01:20:08,647
But there's only one thing
I've ever done right,

1498
01:20:08,934 --> 01:20:10,413
and that's love you.

1499
01:20:13,974 --> 01:20:15,123
Baby, let's go home.

1500
01:20:18,494 --> 01:20:20,803
You mean the one we just bought?

1501
01:20:22,854 --> 01:20:26,403
- How did...? How did you do it?
- Well, Norton helped out a little bit,

1502
01:20:26,654 --> 01:20:28,690
but no one deserves this
more than you, Alice.

1503
01:20:30,654 --> 01:20:33,088
Baby, you're the greatest.

1504
01:20:48,094 --> 01:20:50,210
All right, guys. Come on.
Quit your pissing and moaning.

1505
01:20:50,454 --> 01:20:53,571
The doghouse is not that heavy.
And it goes in the back, facing east,

1506
01:20:53,814 --> 01:20:55,167
so it gets feng shui, you got it?

1507
01:20:55,414 --> 01:20:57,132
And, Mama Gibson,
please don't drop another box.

1508
01:20:57,374 --> 01:20:58,568
I don't got insurance, okay?

1509
01:20:58,814 --> 01:21:00,611
You don't have no manners
either, Mr. Eazy Dodge.

1510
01:21:00,854 --> 01:21:02,287
You gonna get into it with me?
All right.

1511
01:21:02,534 --> 01:21:03,967
Ladies. Ladies, please hurry up.

1512
01:21:04,214 --> 01:21:05,966
We're gonna have a lunch break.

1513
01:21:06,214 --> 01:21:08,774
- And make this house a home. Amen.

01:21:47,574 --> 01:21:48,643
Solid brass?

1532
01:21:48,894 --> 01:21:50,930
Ralph, you said you weren't
gonna get mad at me no more.

1533
01:21:51,174 --> 01:21:53,290
No, Norton. I'm not gonna get mad.

1534
01:21:53,534 --> 01:21:55,331

01:21:59,294 --> 01:22:01,410
Ralph, I know

1538

1542
01:22:22,534 --> 01:22:23,683
When he win that money.

1544
01:22:26,454 --> 01:22:29,526

01:22:46,254 --> 01:22:48,484
Stop rubbing on his balls.
Get out the chair, lggy.

1547
01:22:48,734 --> 01:22:51,328
Is that his balls? Oh, man.
Why didn't you tell me?

1548
01:22:51,574 --> 01:22:53,724
Well, my father used to train
neglected Chihuahuas

1549
01:22:53,974 --> 01:22:56,363
with Down syndrome, and then...

1550
01:22:57,734 --> 01:22:59,804
It's not that he has any kind
of mental problem.

1551
01:23:00,054 --> 01:23:02,249
He just likes to slobber.

1552
01:23:02,494 --> 01:23:03,688
What do you mean, "Let it go"?

1553
01:23:03,934 --> 01:23:06,289
I'm here looking like a birthday balloon.
You want me to let it go.

1554
01:23:06,534 --> 01:23:08,047
I'm looking like a bottle of
dishwashing liquid.

1555
01:23:08,294 --> 01:23:09,727
Kumquat. Summer squash.
A stick of butter.

1556

Let it go? I'm looking like
somebody's cracked teeth.

1557
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:16,163
You look more like
a piece of flan. Let's go.

1558
01:23:16,414 --> 01:23:18,325
- F**k you. Come here.

1559
01:23:18,574 --> 01:23:20,530
What's up? What's up?

1560
01:25:44,774 --> 01:25:46,492
