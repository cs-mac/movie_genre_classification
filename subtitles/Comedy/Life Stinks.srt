1
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,380
...down twenty-four points
in light trading...

2
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,219
sixty-two million shares.

3
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,623
declines outnumber advances
three to two.

4
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:32,254
new claims for unemployment
benefits rose 45,000...

5
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,856
in the fourth week of April
to 455,000.

6
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:37,937
The number of persons
collecting benefits rose 39,000.

7
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,370
They still are running
at about 3.5 million.

8
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:41,864
The weekly jobless claims
figures...

9
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:44,808
are the earliest indication
of how the economy is doing...

10
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,776
and will give
any early signal...

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,280
when the economy begins
to come out of recession.

12
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:54,752
Gold--up $1 .20 at the afternoon
fixing in London at 356.85.

13
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,920
-Jeez!
-Oh, shit.

14
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,292
lnternational communications
is the most active issue.

15
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,597
lt's down a dollar,
at forty-seven.

16
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:14,400
U.S. Amalgamated is down a half,
at twenty-nine.

17
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:17,271
The biggest move of the day--
Bolt enterprises.

18
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,574
The stock is up $6.00, at 82,
sparked by reports...

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,877
that Goddard Bolt intends
to purchase a prime section...

20
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,417
of downtown Los Angeles
real estate.

21
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,254
Morning, Mr. Bolt.

22
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:33,791
Morning.

23
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:13,521
Gentlemen, let's go to work.

24
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:17,426
Pritchard, how are we doing
with our development in Brazil?

25
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,464
Mr. Bolt, we just learned...

26
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:23,468
that in order to build Club Bolt
the way you envision it...

27
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,004
we'd be forced to cut down
six thousand acres...

28
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:28,433
of natural Brazilian
rain forest.

29
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,974
So?

30
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:34,339
Well, sir, the last four hundred
remaining lpi lndians...

31
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,510
left in the world
are still living there.

32
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,843
So?

33
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,783
Sir, if we cut down
their forest...

34
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,293
we'd have to displace them,
and they could cause trouble.

35
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,890
Well, they're not gonna want
to live there anymore anyway.

36
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,467
-Why not?
-no shade.

37
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,801
How are we doing with
our new development in Florida?

38
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:05,708
Sir, we are having a slight
problem in Fort Lauderdale.

39
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,973
ln order to make room
for the magnificent...

40
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,375
largest-in-the-world
Bolt shopping mall...

41
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:13,975
we're going to have to tear down
a nursing home for the aged.

42
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,481
So?

43
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:19,854
Well, at present, there are 1 80
very old people living there...

44
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,859
and we understand that
most of them are invalids...

45
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,191
who are bedridden and dying.

46
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,730
So?

47
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,994
lt wouldn't look good
in the papers.

48
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,830
Ah, l get your point.

49
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,733
do it late at night.

50
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,471
Excellent!

51
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:46,348
Gentlemen,
l have a little surprise.

52
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,513
Follow me.

53
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,750
-What is this?
-Looks like a slum area.

54
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,756
You are looking
at 2.5 square miles...

55
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,018
of the most derelict,
dilapidated section...

56
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,761
of Los Angeles.

57
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,023
Right now,
l own half of this property.

58
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,233
The city owns the other half,
but by noon tomorrow...

59
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,325
it will all be mine.

60
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,635
Ow! What is that?

61
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:09,196
One of those little bums
that live down there.

62
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:12,968
l suppose you're wondering
why Goddard Bolt...

63
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,840
is prepared to pay
up to $4 billion...

64
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,473
to own this worthless
pile of refuse. Am l right?

65
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:22,179
Well, we would never presume
to question your genius...

66
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:26,224
for financial wizardry, sir,
but why?

67
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,352
Wait.

68
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:45,300
Gentlemen, the ultimate
achievement of my life--

69
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:46,844
Bolt Center.

70
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,379
lt's absolutely visionary.

71
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,642
-Fantastic!
-lncredible!

72
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,775
Gentlemen, you'll never know...

73
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,683
how much this project
excites me.

74
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,284
Mr. Bolt, you have
a surprise visitor.

75
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,420
-Who is it?
-Vance Crasswell, sir.

76
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,623
Crasswell? damn it!

77
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,604
Thank you. Let's go.

78
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,675
Excuse me.

79
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,710
Am l interrupting?

80
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,746
l'm interrupting.
l'm interrupting.

81
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,476
l should leave. Should l leave?
l'm gonna leave.

82
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,850
Can l come in?

83
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,286
Hello, Vance.
You know my attorneys--

84
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,652
Pritchard, Knowles, Stevens.

85
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:35,956
The three wise men.
Hiya, fellas. What's going on?

86
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,753
Oh, my God!

87
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:41,595
Oh, my God! Someone else's idea
of what to do...

88
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,931
with the downtown slum district.

89
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,503
Would you bel--

90
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,866
Why didn't they tell me Goddard
Bolt owned the other half?

91
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,706
l never would have bought it.
no one beats Goddard Bolt...

92
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,280
when it comes to financial
wheeling and dealing.

93
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,714
now, look,
l'm in way over my head here.

94
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:02,651
l'm sorry to have
wasted your time, gentlemen.

95
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,858
Mr. Bolt...

96
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,824
Can l ask you a question?

97
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,759
Let me buy your half
of the property.

98
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,558
l'll give you $2 billion...

99
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,758
4°/° of the profit
for the next twenty years.

100
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,596
-no.
-5°/°.

101
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,795
-no.
-Six.

102
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,271
-Stop.
-Stopped.

103
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,540
Vance, why don't you
let me buy you out?

104
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,271
Look at us.

105
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,646
An office
is no place to do business.

106
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,711
l have a much better idea.

107
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,445
now, isn't this better?

108
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,649
At least we can see
what we're dealing with.

109
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,727
OK, final offer.

110
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:49,265
l want this property.
l want it.

111
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,892
lt just so happens...

112
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:55,702
l grew up five blocks
from where we're standing.

113
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,332
l'm all right.

114
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:02,176
Right in the middle
of this godforsaken slum.

115
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:07,480
lt's been my lifelong dream
to come back and rebuild it.

116
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,281
lt's OK. You can laugh.

117
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,356
l don't expect you
to understand my feelings.

118
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,687
After all,
you're a rich man's son.

119
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,226
You were born into money.

120
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,455
What, are you kidding?
My father left me five million.

121
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:18,621
lt's nothing.

122
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:21,256
no, no, no. nothing is nothing!

123
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,193
These people down here
have nothing. Zero!

124
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,431
Look, l don't want
to hurt your feelings.

125
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,236
You couldn't survive
ten minutes down here.

126
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,676
don't be ridiculous.
l would survive anywhere.

127
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:37,340
Right. Without your money
and your credit cards?

128
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:38,916
Yes.

129
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,584
Without identifying yourself
to anyone as Goddard Bolt?

130
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,313
Yes.

131
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,356
For a modest period of time--

132
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,291
l don't know, let's say,
thirty days?

133
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,794
Absolutely.

134
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,331
lt's a bet.

135
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,526
Bet?
What are you talking about?

136
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,799
Well, what you just said--that
you could survive down here...

137
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,500
without using any
of your resources for 30 days.

138
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,473
lf you do it, you get
my half of the property.

139
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:08,604
You don't do it,
l'm gonna get yours.

140
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,274
l'm sorry.
Wasn't that the bet?

141
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:20,386
You conniving son of a bitch.

142
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,393
Yes!

143
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,330
lt's a bet.

144
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:31,927
You've underestimated me, Vance.
l can do it.

145
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:35,173
You can't do it!
You'll never make it!

146
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:38,539
This is insane. This is crazy.
You'll never survive.

147
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:42,307
Pritchard, be quiet.
Fergueson, go on.

148
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,940
Thank you. lf you leave
the prescribed slum area...

149
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,776
or try to remove this
ankle alarm, it will go off...

150
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,820
and if we receive
a sustained alarm signal...

151
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,517
for more than thirty seconds,
you'll forfeit the bet.

152
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,356
After thirty days, the alarm
will automatically deactivate.

153
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,487
Are these conditions understood?

154
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,963
Understood.

155
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:04,225
-And we have your word on that?
-Yes. You have my word on it.

156
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,828
Pritchard, l'm giving
you and your partners...

157
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,463
my power of attorney.

158
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:11,008
l'm trusting you to look
after all my legal affairs...

159
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,245
for the next thirty days.

160
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:20,284
Take it. Take it all.
l won't need anything.

161
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:23,480
And you won't need this either.

162
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:27,958
What are you doing?

163
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,024
l have to make sure
no one recognizes you.

164
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,027
That was stitched in.

165
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,435
Give me a comb.

166
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:45,367
l don't think you realize
what you're getting into.

167
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,778
You've never slept
in the street before.

168
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,312
You've never eaten
out of garbage cans.

169
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,779
You're used
to a hearty breakfast.

170
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:52,350
This is ludicrous. Look at you
without your toupee.

171
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,784
You look like somebody
who only makes $50,000 a year.

172
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,618
Mr. Bolt, please don't do this.

173
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,919
Let me suggest
you wait twenty-four hours.

174
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:04,519
-At least sleep on it.
-l've given my word.

175
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,791
do you want me
to go back on my word?

176
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:12,303
-Would you go back on your word?
-Certainly. We're lawyers.

177
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,305
Give me that contract.

178
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:28,811
OK, Goddard, here we are.

179
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,387
Come on.

180
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:37,826
now, in thirty days,
at the exact moment of sunset...

181
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,763
all of this property
is gonna be yours or mine.

182
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,926
Either way, l think we should
have a big party at my house.

183
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,699
-Let's make it at my house.
-OK, your house.

184
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,307
For the look.

185
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,684
-Thanks.
-Let's get out of here.

186
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,454
''Ooms.''

187
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,776
Excuse me.

188
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,643
Two fifty a night.
Checkout--eleven a.m.

189
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,649
You pay in advance.

190
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,252
May l see the room first?

191
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,446
Right behind me, through
those curtains. Take a look.

192
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,930
lt's rather crowded, isn't it?

193
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:27,631
Yeah.
We get good word of mouth.

194
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,905
do you have a single room?

195
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,380
With or without a jacuzzi?

196
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,576
Look, l got one bed left.

197
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,619
You want it or not?
Make up your mind.

198
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:43,881
l'll take it.

199
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,422
OK. Sign the register.

200
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:55,959
-What was that? A roach?
-no. A mouse. Just a baby.

201
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:59,265
Look, it's two-fifty in advance.

202
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:02,431
Two-fifty.

203
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,738
Could we have a private
conversation just entre nous?

204
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:10,910
All right. Listen,
l'm not really a derelict.

205
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,211
l'm down here on a wager.
l happen to be...

206
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:17,584
one of the richest men in
the country, if not the richest.

207
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,317
The richest?

208
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,484
Yes, and if you give me
a bed tonight...

209
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:27,328
at the end of this month,
l will give you $10,000.

210
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:32,632
All right, l'll up the ante.

211
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,729
$20,000.

212
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,275
now you're talking.
20,000.

213
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,711
Look, l'll give you a break.

214
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:46,683
l don't need
the whole 20,000 tonight...

215
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:51,222
but if you give me $2.50
as a down payment...

216
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,813
the bed is yours.

217
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,758
Otherwise,
get the hell out of here.

218
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,757
Who is it?

219
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:04,420
Please let me in.
l need shelter.

220
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:09,490
l'm sorry.
We're closed, my son.

221
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:14,971
But l haven't eaten all day.
l need food.

222
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,904
We'll be open
in the morning, my son.

223
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,640
You don't understand.

224
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:27,742
l don't have a place to sleep.
l'm tired--very tired. Very.

225
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:31,253
Please, please let me in.

226
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,621
now listen!
You're waking everybody up!

227
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,889
now you get out of here,
or l'll call the police!

228
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,759
My son.

229
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,654
Oh, my God.

230
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,168
God.

231
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:45,356
-Hey!
-Jeez! You scared me!

232
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,527
l didn't know
anybody was under there.

233
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,601
l always go here.

234
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,464
l thought l saw someone...

235
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,368
but then l thought it was
a frigment of my imagination.

236
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,270
Why don't you look first?

237
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,344
Yeah, you're right.
You're right. Sorry.

238
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,772
You almost hit me.
That's disgusting.

239
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,781
lt is?

240
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,681
Yes, it is! Why don't you
use a handkerchief?

241
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,811
Handkerchief?
l ain't got a handkerchief.

242
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,820
l don't think
l ever had a handkerchief.

243
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,623
Here, take this.

244
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,854
Gee, thanks. nobody down here
ever gives you nothing.

245
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,897
You're all right.

246
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,862
What are you doing?

247
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:29,930
-''P-e-p-t-o. Pepto.''
-What?

248
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,337
lt's hard to read backwards,
but that's what it says.

249
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,312
You must have slept
on a Pepto-Bismol box.

250
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,179
See?

251
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:43,186
-Yeah.
-don't rub it off. lt's nice.

252
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,189
lt's a nice name, Pepto.
l'm Sailor.

253
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,226
Everybody calls me Sailor
'cause l was nearly in the navy.

254
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,353
That's nice.

255
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,988
They wouldn't take me 'cause
they said l had pleurilsy.

256
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,200
Very nice meeting you.

257
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,237
-Good-bye.
-Bye-bye. nice to see you.

258
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:06,370
-l just gave you a handkerchief.
-Yeah, but it's got initials.

259
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,503
You can't blow snot in initials.

260
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,447
-See you.
-Yeah. See you.

261
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,220
Excuse me. l wonder...

262
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,299
could you tell me where
l could get something to eat?

263
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,858
don't ask me. l don't know where
my next meal's coming from.

264
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:50,813
Get the hell out of here!
l told all you goddamn bums!

265
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,719
l don't want you
hanging around here!

266
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,486
You gonna make it look
like a low-class place!

267
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,330
Give to a poor blind man.

268
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:23,249
Man, don't even think about it.

269
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,321
Good morning, sir.

270
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,288
Get away from my car!
What are you doing?

271
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,756
Just cleaning
your windshield, sir.

272
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,260
Cleaning my windshield?
You made it worse.

273
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:09,424
-There. That better?
-Oh, wonderful.

274
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:12,901
-Can l have a dollar, please?
-Get away! The light is green.

275
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:17,874
My hand! Wait! Wait! l'm caught!

276
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:22,310
Wait! Stop! Forget the dollar!

277
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,808
A penny.

278
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,765
-Excuse me.
-What do you want?

279
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:54,236
-l want to get past.
-You want to get past?

280
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,773
He wants to get past.

281
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,706
Get past.

282
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,373
Come on, get past, get past.

283
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,183
Hurry! Get his shoes!

284
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:18,353
-Hey! What the--
-Get his shoes.

285
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:20,355
He's kicking. Choke him.

286
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:23,563
Help! Help! Help!

287
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,350
You no-good scumbags!

288
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,717
You stay away from here!

289
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,788
Those dirty bastards!

290
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,422
Thank you.

291
00:23:54,533 --> 00:24:00,267
l didn't do that for you.
Those pigs invaded my territory.

292
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,797
l'm very territorial.

293
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,638
Yeah, l noticed that.

294
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:10,181
Gee, they would have killed me
just for my shoes.

295
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,477
They're animals!

296
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,552
They tried that on me
when l first came down here.

297
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:17,416
They jumped me.

298
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,956
Ha! Big mistake.

299
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:22,624
nobody messes with Molly.

300
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:25,719
l grabbed that big guy,
Mean Victor, by the apricots...

301
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:30,825
and l twisted, and l twisted,
and l twisted.

302
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:35,236
-Know what l mean?
-l do. l know what you mean.

303
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,207
Good. This is my place.

304
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,335
l live alone.

305
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:59,229
-You still here?
-l don't have any shoes.

306
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,562
Who are you? What are you doin'
down here anyway?

307
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,829
lt's complicated.

308
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:09,202
don't tell me.
l don't want to know.

309
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,873
-What are you, about a 9 1 /2 d?
-Yes, exactly.

310
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:19,678
Yes! l'm never wrong.
Come here. Come here.

311
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,723
Stop looking over my shoulder.
Sit down!

312
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,553
not--are you stupid?
That's the bedroom.

313
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,321
Sit in the den.

314
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:35,195
The den.

315
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,600
Excuse me.
Just where would the den be?

316
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,229
You're in it. Sit.

317
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,472
Good.

318
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,485
Tens. Close enough.

319
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,451
Here we go.

320
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:02,486
-Brown.
-What?

321
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:06,621
Oh, nothing, nothing.
They're fine. They're just fine.

322
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,255
Thank you. Thank you.

323
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:12,769
now, look, l got work to do.
disappear.

324
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:21,337
Excuse me, would there be
a place around here...

325
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:23,778
that l could get
something to eat?

326
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:27,409
Yeah. Going through the garbage
or going to the mission.

327
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:32,319
Where would l find the mission?

328
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,349
Hey, what do l look like,
a tour guide?

329
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,457
l'll find it myself.

330
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:49,202
You're never gonna find it.

331
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:51,537
You're going
in the wrong direction.

332
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,201
He's hopeless.

333
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,905
Wait. Let me cover my cans.

334
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,216
l'm going there myself.
l'll show you.

335
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:04,411
l saved your life.
l saved your feet.

336
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,490
This is your last help.

337
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:24,675
This means a lot to us.
God bless you.

338
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,844
Could l have a little more?

339
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,923
Just one more.

340
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:41,419
Thank you.

341
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,464
Hey, Pepto!

342
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,903
-Pepto?
-Yeah, that's me.

343
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,405
Come sit with us. Over here.

344
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,238
Come on. There are
two empty seats over there.

345
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:03,712
Hey, Pepto, l see you met Molly.
Hi, Molly. How you doing?

346
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,581
-You two know each other?
-Oh, yeah. We're old pals.

347
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,212
l relieved myself on him
this morning...by mistake.

348
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,325
See? Still unused.

349
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:22,699
Pepto, l'd like you
to say hello to my friend Fumes.

350
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,292
Howdy.

351
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:37,475
Man, oh, man! Stewed stew.

352
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:40,449
-You get it?
-l get it.

353
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:45,415
l'm gonna get some bread.
Anybody want anything?

354
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:48,321
-Yeah. Get me some whole wheat.
-All right, baby.

355
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,290
Excuse me.
l hate to be so impulsive...

356
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,567
but you have a little bit
of corn right on your cheek.

357
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:02,367
Oh, thanks. ls it gone?

358
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:06,274
no, you've moved it up
to your cheekbone.

359
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,704
ls it gone?

360
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,615
lt's right in the bridge
of your nose now.

361
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,851
did l get it?

362
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:26,162
Yeah, you got it.

363
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:33,295
Here you go, Molly. All right.

364
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,798
Hey, man.

365
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,774
You got a piece of corn
on your face.

366
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,223
Anybody finished here?

367
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,792
-l am.
-Thank you.

368
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,417
Thanks, Pops.

369
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,525
Pops ain't gonna be around long.

370
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,999
-His elevens are up.
-What?

371
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,760
His elevens.
Look at the back of his neck.

372
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:12,537
See them two cords sticking out?
They make like an eleven.

373
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:16,512
Once they're up, that's it.
He's a goner.

374
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:18,980
Oh, boy.

375
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,219
Maybe he'll come back in
the world as something better.

376
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:28,451
Personally, when l die,
l'd like to come back as a bird.

377
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,221
Why?

378
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:34,389
Because, man,
l could fly free and easy...

379
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:37,460
and if l saw someone
l really didn't care for...

380
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:40,333
l'd drop a hot one on 'em.

381
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:45,274
When l die,
l want to be excremated...

382
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:49,369
and l want my ashes sprinkled
in the old Briny.

383
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,780
At least l'd be part of the sea
forever and ever.

384
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:56,944
Oh, that's beautiful, man.
Beautiful.

385
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,989
When l die, l want to go
just like my daddy--boom...

386
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:01,718
peaceful, in his sleep.

387
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:04,351
They told me my grandmother died
peacefully in her sleep.

388
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:05,353
lt's a good way to go.

389
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:08,261
nobody dies peacefully
in their sleep.

390
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,597
That's what they tell people
to make them feel good.

391
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,501
You want to know how people
really die in their sleep?

392
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,902
First, they go to bed.

393
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,509
Then about 2:00 in the morning
they go...

394
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:46,235
Get a doctor.

395
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,379
l ain't never
goin' to sleep again.

396
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:02,514
l have to make some money.

397
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,781
How can l make some money
down here?

398
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,982
Why don't you do
what they all do?

399
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,658
-What?
-Beg.

400
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:16,394
Beg. l tried that, but l'm not
really proficient in that yet.

401
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:31,280
Bye-bye, children. l love you.
Have a safe trip.

402
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:36,819
And remember, this is
a new start. no drinking!

403
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,392
And no drugs!

404
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:45,894
And above all, no infidelity!

405
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:57,340
Shut up!
l didn't say that much.

406
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,467
Take it easy.

407
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:02,842
Can you believe that in
the middle of all this filth...

408
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:06,405
two lost souls could find
some small shred of happiness?

409
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:09,952
Happiness? What a crock.

410
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:11,882
See you after the honeymoon.

411
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,756
Lady! You got a job,
you keep it!

412
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,953
don't make my mistake.

413
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,265
You had a job?

414
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,426
A job?

415
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:26,867
l had a career.

416
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:31,704
l was a dancer,
and a good one...

417
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:35,245
before l gave it up
when l got married!

418
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,214
You were married?

419
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,286
Oh, you bet l was married.

420
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:47,687
l was married to Tom--
Tom Terrific.

421
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:50,260
Sure, Tom.
Anything you want, Tom.

422
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,990
You want it now, Tom?

423
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:57,757
Oh, sure, Tom. Go ahead, Tom.

424
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:02,306
What?
Finished already, Tom?

425
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:05,934
no, l don't mind, Tom.

426
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,871
Where you going, Tom?

427
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:12,382
You wash up, Tom.
l'll finish by myself, Tom!

428
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,454
Where did you go, Tom?

429
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:23,258
You didn't leave a note, Tom.

430
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,795
l'm all alone here, Tom.

431
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,297
You left me all the bills, Tom.

432
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,959
They're taking away the house.

433
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,898
Tom, l don't have a job, Tom!

434
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:37,440
l'm in a lot of trouble.

435
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:46,346
So, after Tom ran out...

436
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:50,011
l realized l had to adjust
my entire lifestyle.

437
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:52,846
l created this whole
new mental attitude.

438
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:57,326
lt's called a nervous breakdown.
l cried a lot. l screamed a lot.

439
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,555
l was hysterical
morning, noon, and night.

440
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,256
l was like this--

441
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,959
Help me! Somebody help me!

442
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,374
Get the picture?

443
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:14,536
l got it. Yes, l got it.
l think the whole block got it.

444
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:18,240
So, l've been in this
nervous breakdown...

445
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,317
for about eight years.

446
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,316
And you know something?
l like it.

447
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,388
l walk when l want,
l sit down when l want...

448
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,581
l cry when l want,
l laugh when l want.

449
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:29,352
l pick my own hours.

450
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,325
Sounds a little...

451
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:33,628
Crazy? There's nothing wrong
with crazy.

452
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,824
Crazy's good.
Crazy keeps them away.

453
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:42,564
So what's your story?
You ever been married?

454
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:46,905
Yes, l tried it once.
didn't work out.

455
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:49,878
She said l spent all my time
making money.

456
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,875
That was time well spent.

457
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:01,951
Wet it down. All over. All over.

458
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:03,922
So it burns up nice.

459
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:10,264
Oh, this is gonna burn big!
Big stuff here, Victor!

460
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:14,331
Yeah, get it. That's it.
l wish l had some marshmallows!

461
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:15,432
-Light it.
-What?

462
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,802
-Light it!
-Light it!

463
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:20,275
Light it. Oh, Victor,
this is going to be so good.

464
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:24,643
Oh, yeah. Yeah! Just look at it.

465
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:27,274
Burn, burn. Yes, yes!

466
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:31,320
Yeah! Look at it!
Look at it! l love fire!

467
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:35,624
-She won't fool with us no more.
-We should go now, Victor.

468
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,270
What was that all about?

469
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:49,739
Hey, it's my place!

470
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,975
My stuff!

471
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,345
Shall l call
the fire department?

472
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:03,817
no.
lt's just a bunch of junk.

473
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,369
l'm gonna get those bastards.

474
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,467
Come over here. l want you
to get Mean Victor and Yo...

475
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:30,638
and get them to chase you down
here to this Chinese restaurant.

476
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,308
-Me?
-Yes.

477
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:36,913
Then l want you
to run through this door...

478
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:38,483
and lock it behind you.

479
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:42,719
now, if you lock it,
you're safe.

480
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,260
We'll do the rest.

481
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:47,457
Can you do this?

482
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,658
May l propose an alternative?

483
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,565
-What?
-Why don't we sue?

484
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:58,900
You may be
the weak link in this.

485
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,877
You know what to do
when you get to the kitchen.

486
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:34,768
Weak link.

487
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:41,876
l'm addressing
the two degenerates...

488
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:43,953
who call themselves
Victor and Yo.

489
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:47,349
You rob and exploit the helpless
for your own profit and gain...

490
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,323
and use the spoils
of your activities...

491
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,991
to buy and sell
illegal narcotics.

492
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:56,859
Therefore, l am making
a citizen's arrest.

493
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:01,236
Citizen's arrest.

494
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,299
And you won't
be needing this anymore.

495
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:09,273
Get him! Get him!

496
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:16,279
You have the right
to remain silent.

497
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,718
Anything you say
can and will be used...

498
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:20,814
against you in a court of law.

499
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,771
God damn it!

500
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:02,856
Thank God!

501
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:04,628
Wait a minute.

502
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:07,533
don't pour! Wait till
they're right under us.

503
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:09,697
All right. l admit it.
l have a very weak case.

504
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,537
You'll be happy to know
l'm dropping the charges.

505
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,218
Oh, shit!

506
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:26,653
l'm out of bounds.

507
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,885
-What's that noise?
-l don't know.

508
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,295
lt stopped.

509
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:45,399
What's he doing?
He's coming back again?

510
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:49,608
He's the bravest man
l've ever seen.

511
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:52,273
l'm not mad. l just want
to put my foot up here.

512
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,783
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

513
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,346
Pepto, get out of the way!

514
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,185
now!

515
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,198
Oh, it's hot!

516
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,207
They won't come around here
anymore.

517
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,371
l hope so.

518
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,382
Jeez,
they really did a job on you.

519
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:29,384
Man, you throw a mean face.

520
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,785
Well, according to this,
his ankle alarm went off...

521
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:37,861
at 3:35 for 28 1 /2 seconds.

522
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,362
Well, let's just say 30 seconds.
Then we'd win.

523
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:44,233
But his lawyers get a copy
of the same readout, sir.

524
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,597
does anybody know why he stepped
out of bounds...

525
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:51,266
for 28 1 /2 seconds?

526
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,639
Well, our surveillance tell us
that he was attacked...

527
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,473
by some vicious
derelicts, sir...

528
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,740
and, l might add,
was severely beaten.

529
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,215
-He almost, uh--
-He almost what?

530
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,252
died.

531
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:06,788
My God! died?

532
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:15,356
l don't want to be responsible
for his death.

533
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:18,291
You think there's any chance
that could happen?

534
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:20,396
Well, it is possible.

535
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:23,234
He is living in the streets,
and there's so much danger...

536
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,501
down there, you never know
what could happen.

537
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:27,634
We'll keep you posted,
Mr. Crasswell.

538
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:30,942
Yes, thank you.

539
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,285
die.

540
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,948
l never thought
he could actually die.

541
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:46,455
That would be so tragic.

542
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,466
There. This will help.

543
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,845
What is that?

544
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:04,847
lt's some stuff Fumes drinks.

545
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,849
lt'll kill anything
except Fumes.

546
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:08,781
He's germ-proof.
Germs wouldn't live in him.

547
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:12,184
l'm being invaded by one.

548
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,386
dead germ.

549
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:20,224
Looks like it's going to rain.
l don't like the rain.

550
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:23,323
We can sleep in this box.
do you got a place to sleep?

551
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,595
no. As a matter of fact,
we don't.

552
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:28,467
There's boxes over there.
Come on, let's get 'em one.

553
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:34,470
Here's a good one.

554
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:49,392
now, this is my side,
this is your side...

555
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:53,626
and this is a World War ll
army-navy surplus store bayonet.

556
00:43:57,368 --> 00:44:00,235
This will remind us
of our boundaries, OK?

557
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:04,740
l assure you l have no intention
of coming near you...

558
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:09,245
or touching you or in any way
violating your person.

559
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:13,248
Oh, please. l've heard
those same fancy words...

560
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:16,319
from other guys
just before they jump you.

561
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:20,355
Good night.

562
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:28,824
Look, l don't mean to be harsh.
lt's just that you're a man...

563
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:31,696
and men are no good.

564
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:41,336
-l can do it.
-do what?

565
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:44,213
Oh, nothing. nothing.
Good night. Good night.

566
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:12,605
lt's raining.

567
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,201
l love the rain.

568
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:18,179
lt washes all the filth
out of the city.

569
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:19,442
Speaking of filth...

570
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,986
where would Goddard Bolt go
on a night like this?

571
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:26,620
Well, if it were very bad,
he'd go to the mission...

572
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,315
with the other derelicts.

573
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,749
lt's a shame--
it's a rotten shame--

574
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:32,658
that these people
have to live like this...

575
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:35,288
always on the edge
of uncertainty.

576
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,698
Any chance of getting
that mission closed tonight?

577
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:42,499
-Very good idea, sir.
-Thank you.

578
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:48,210
lt's coming down harder.

579
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:16,168
What the heck's going on?

580
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:22,170
We're getting flooded out.
Come on. Come on, let's go.

581
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,259
Oh, man!

582
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:38,293
Look out, Sailor.

583
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:40,295
Well, there goes
the neighborhood.

584
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:42,388
Oh, this is bad.

585
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:47,294
The rain always
kicks up my cough.

586
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:50,805
We'd better get to the mission.

587
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:52,341
Look out.

588
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,263
Open the door.

589
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:16,832
Open up in there!
We're getting wet!

590
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:19,266
lt's locked. lt's locked!

591
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:22,638
lt's locked.

592
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:26,539
Why would they lock the mission
on a night like this?

593
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:04,514
Hey, Fumes. l really feel lousy.

594
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:08,312
Tell me the truth. Take a look.
Are my elevens up?

595
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:11,353
no, man, no. God damn it,
let me go to sleep.

596
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:16,188
Oh, that's good. That's good.
l'm gonna go down to the clinic.

597
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:18,488
Maybe they can
give me something.

598
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:21,291
See ya.

599
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:44,786
Hey, Sailor?

600
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:09,177
Hey, y'all. Hey, hey.
Wake up. Wake up.

601
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,679
-Have you seen Sailor?
-no.

602
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:17,721
He looked like shit last night.
Maybe l oughta go look for him.

603
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:20,813
OK. Look, we'll all go
look for him. Come on.

604
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,553
You go up there.
You go down there.

605
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:28,324
-Go up there?
-Yeah. Go on, go on.

606
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:59,586
That guy is dead.
He's blocking my place.

607
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:01,220
You know him,
get him out of here.

608
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:06,764
All right, OK. All right.
The show is over, all right?

609
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,304
Come on, you're blocking
the place here.

610
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:11,271
What's the matter?
You never seen a stiff before?

611
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,809
Go on. Beat it, all right?

612
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,288
-What do you got?
-He's gone.

613
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:28,358
-He's been dead a long time.
-Better call the coroner.

614
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,323
nah. They got too many
d.O.A.s already.

615
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:31,792
Let's just take him
to the morgue.

616
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:16,429
You call this an ocean?

617
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,566
Well, sooner or later,
it all goes to the ocean.

618
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:23,308
Why are we doing this?

619
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,280
We're doing this because
Sailor wanted his ashes...

620
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:28,817
sprinkled in the old Briny.

621
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:30,977
He's so light.

622
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:35,315
-How much did he weigh?
-1 30, maybe 1 40 pounds.

623
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,484
Must have been mostly moisture.

624
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,358
ls that the best you could do?
A shoe box?

625
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,830
We're lucky to get it.
Let's face it--

626
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,730
they put the rich in an urn,

627
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:47,929
and they put the poor in
a cardboard box, like takeout.

628
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:53,970
Well, go ahead.

629
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,443
Oh, man, here. You do it.
You talk the best.

630
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:08,220
Sailor, wherever you are...

631
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:12,191
He's in there.

632
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,263
l know.

633
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:17,697
Sailor, you were a little man...

634
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,894
often covered
with dirt and filth...

635
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:22,597
and the last thing
that you ate....

636
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:25,698
but your heart
was always good and clean...

637
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,674
and l hope you get
your final wish...

638
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:32,271
and your ashes make it
out to sea.

639
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:37,886
Good luck.

640
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:45,350
So long, Sailor.
Bye, Sailor.

641
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:46,759
All the best.

642
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:49,331
-Bye, Sailor.
-God bless you, Sailor.

643
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:50,797
Rest in peace, Sailor.

644
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:09,214
Excuse me.

645
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,684
l'm sorry. Am l interrupting?

646
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:14,688
l'm interrupting, aren't l?
Yeah, l should go.

647
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:17,282
l should go,
because this is wrong.

648
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:18,725
lt's stupid. lt's wrong.

649
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,659
lt's morally
and ethically wrong...

650
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:23,392
for me to even be here,
isn't it?

651
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,661
Because we all know
that your client...

652
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,669
only has two days to go
to win the bet.

653
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:30,399
Looks like he's going to win it.
Therefore, l have no business...

654
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:32,839
even being here, do l?

655
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:37,707
l'm just gonna put it simply,
gentlemen.

656
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:40,715
Would you consider...

657
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:44,752
betraying the man for whom
you've worked ten years...

658
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:50,952
in exchange for--
how do you say this--

659
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,689
just a shitload of money?

660
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:10,641
l made it.

661
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:14,308
l can't believe it. l made it.

662
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:17,344
My last day.

663
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:21,690
no more filthy clothes,
no more eating garbage...

664
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:24,316
no more sleeping in the cold.

665
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,225
Thank you. Thank you, God.

666
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:32,726
l'm sorry l didn't believe
in you when l was rich.

667
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:38,266
l did it! l did it!

668
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:42,277
Where did he do it?
not around here, l hope.

669
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:47,282
Molly! Molly! Molly!
Champagne! Champagne!

670
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:48,941
-l stole it.
-What?

671
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:51,777
lt's OK. l left
an l.O.U. for $1 ,000.

672
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:56,017
Here. Here. Help me celebrate.

673
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,954
Celebrate what?

674
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,586
-l won the bet.
-What bet?

675
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:02,289
The bet! The bet!

676
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,594
When you find out about it
it's going to make you...

677
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:07,932
the happiest person
in the world. Here.

678
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:11,640
-Here's to happy.
-no, no. l don't like happy.

679
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:14,369
Happy's no good.
Happy doesn't last.

680
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:19,380
l like depressed. depressed
stays with you for a while.

681
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:23,316
OK. Here's to depressed.

682
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:25,254
OK. l'll drink to that.

683
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,261
This is good.

684
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,929
lt's raining!
Come on. Let's get inside.

685
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:40,867
Run inside. Go in that door.

686
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:43,837
Watch the step.
l've got to dump my stuff.

687
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:51,406
Careful. Let me get the lights.

688
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,687
-Good. lt's empty.
-Here.

689
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:03,918
Hey! What are you trying to do,
get me drunk?

690
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,662
Yeah. How am l doing?

691
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:08,287
doing good.

692
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:15,203
l love that song.
That's my favorite song.

693
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:23,605
-dance with me. Come on.
-no.

694
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,613
Come on.
You said you were a dancer.

695
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:29,378
l don't dance.
That was a long time ago.

696
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:31,453
This is the greatest night
of my life.

697
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:34,455
Help me celebrate.
l won the bet!

698
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,752
The bet! The bet!

699
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,526
Please.

700
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:52,299
Well...OK. All right,
let me lighten up.

701
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:39,900
Oh, please.

702
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:45,279
Hurry, hurry.

703
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:46,647
l am.

704
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,219
l want you. l want you.

705
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,218
Where are you?

706
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:58,757
-Faster, faster.
-l'm going as fast as l can.

707
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:05,797
You're beautiful.

708
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:11,269
My God! Two buses to get here!
Used up all my change.

709
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:13,706
This is crazy.
We're gonna get busted.

710
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:16,301
don't worry.
Everything is all right.

711
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:19,677
That's my house.
Everything in it is mine.

712
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:22,012
You hear that music?
You hear that laughter?

713
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:25,253
lt's a celebration in my honor.
l won the bet.

714
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:27,288
Again with this bet!

715
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:29,254
Listen, just come in with me...

716
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:33,318
and everything will be
wonderfully clear. Come on!

717
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:35,420
All right.
l'm gonna go with you...

718
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:37,829
but if anything happens,
we're gonna grab what we can...

719
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,663
and run for our lives!

720
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:45,666
Run for our lives! Come on!

721
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:48,869
Oh, you are something!

722
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:51,378
Wait till you see it.
Wait till you see it.

723
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:54,875
don't worry. This is my house!

724
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:58,681
There it is--home.

725
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:05,959
-Come on!
-no! Pepto, no!

726
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:08,322
Come on! lt's all right!

727
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:18,536
Well, l did it.

728
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:22,705
Goddard?

729
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,716
Oh, my God.
lt's such a relief to see you.

730
01:01:29,585 --> 01:01:32,019
What happened to you?
You look like a vagrant.

731
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:35,951
Of course l look like a vagrant.
That was our bet.

732
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:38,493
Bet...

733
01:01:41,497 --> 01:01:44,523
-What bet?
-What bet?

734
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:47,569
Anybody here know
what he's talking about?

735
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,698
does anybody know anything
about this bet?

736
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:55,369
You...

737
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:56,968
Pritchard.

738
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,243
Knowles, Stevens.
What the hell's going on?

739
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:02,750
Show him the contract.
Show him the bet.

740
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:10,925
What's going on here?
Why are you letting this happen?

741
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:18,300
You're all in on it.

742
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:24,433
Ten years.
You've been with me ten years.

743
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:27,236
How could you turn on me?

744
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:31,279
Where's your sense of loyalty,
honesty, decency?

745
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,712
Mr. Bolt, we're lawyers.

746
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:43,255
Wait a minute.
This is still my house!

747
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:46,021
l want everybody out!
do you hear me? Out!

748
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:49,822
Yeah! Yeah, you heard him!
Get out of here!

749
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:55,302
Please. Stay where you are.
Thank you.

750
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:59,534
l'm sorry. You got it all wrong.
This isn't your house anymore.

751
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:03,408
l'm afraid you've been declared
non compos mentis.

752
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:07,847
You see,
when you lost your mind...

753
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:09,451
you lost everything.

754
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:11,849
When you gave us
power of attorney...

755
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:15,321
we did what was best
for everyone.

756
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:17,324
l bought this house
at a public auction.

757
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:20,190
l just couldn't stand
the thought...

758
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:23,265
of strangers living here.

759
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:30,569
l've been living in garbage...

760
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:33,267
with rats...

761
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:35,310
for a month...

762
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:38,209
and now l have nothing?

763
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:43,942
nothing?!
not even my house?!

764
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:58,699
Well, you're not getting these!
no. They're by Cellini.

765
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:01,668
l bought them. l bought them
from the Vatican.

766
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:03,898
l got a good price.

767
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:05,701
My Van Gogh!

768
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:15,548
Come on, dr. Gachet.
We're leaving!

769
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,721
My wine! Hey!

770
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:27,261
Chateau Lafite!

771
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:33,599
Rodin!

772
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,608
My tapestry!

773
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:45,272
l'm not leaving without
my ''Rape of the Sabine Women.''

774
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:49,249
All right, now, Goddard, stop.
Please, stop. This is pathetic.

775
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:52,513
-Get out of my way.
-Fine, fine.

776
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:59,820
Yeah! And we'll be back
for the rest later!

777
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:02,663
Hey, hey! Let go!

778
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:04,323
l've got her!

779
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:06,394
no! My Van Gogh!

780
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,939
This is pathetic, isn't it?

781
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:17,474
Very.

782
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:23,250
Pepto.

783
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:29,256
l'm not Pepto!

784
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:40,329
First thing l gotta do is make
a list of everything l had--

785
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:44,865
cash, stocks,
bonds, investments...

786
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:47,772
real estate, foreign holdings.

787
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,978
l can get it back.
l can get it all back.

788
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:54,580
l gotta make some calls,
reestablish my line of credit.

789
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:56,446
That's all l have to do.
They'll take my calls.

790
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:59,383
Why shouldn't they
take my calls? l'm Goddard Bolt.

791
01:05:59,488 --> 01:06:02,821
l was the richest man
in the world! The richest!

792
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:04,324
Shut up!

793
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:06,486
-Shut up!
-Who are you?

794
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:09,359
l'm J. Paul Getty! l was
the richest man in the world!

795
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,797
You don't see me ranting
and raving about it, do you?

796
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:15,302
-no! l took my losses!
-What losses?

797
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:18,832
during the crash,
the clash, the smash!

798
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:22,342
Listen to me.
You're not J. Paul Getty.

799
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:26,506
You are a pathetic,
broken-minded little bum.

800
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:29,277
ln your mind, you think you're
J. Paul Getty, but you're not.

801
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:32,581
Whilst l, on the other hand,
am Goddard Bolt...

802
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:36,249
a genuine financial giant.

803
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:37,485
So am l.

804
01:06:37,593 --> 01:06:40,687
-You're not.
-l am.

805
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:43,788
-Wait. Come with me.
-Where are we going?

806
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:46,299
Over here. Let's talk.

807
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:49,796
now, look. Let's be reasonable.

808
01:06:49,905 --> 01:06:52,339
There's an enormous difference
between us.

809
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:54,674
Even though in your twisted mind
you think you're rich...

810
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:56,335
you're really not.

811
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:59,509
On the other hand, because of
my serious understanding...

812
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:05,349
of the world of finance,
l have amassed $6.4 billion!

813
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:07,479
And l have amassed 6.5.

814
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:09,523
-You didn't.
-l did.

815
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:15,297
Wait!

816
01:07:19,635 --> 01:07:20,761
Look.

817
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:24,270
Wait a minute.
Let me show you something.

818
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:25,567
-What?
-This.

819
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,681
-Look, l don't want to hurt you.
-You don't?

820
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:38,220
no. lt's just that
it's important to me...

821
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,311
that you understand.

822
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:44,654
l guess it doesn't make
any difference who's richer.

823
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,660
Well, forget about it.

824
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:48,662
Oh, God, thanks...

825
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:51,892
'cause l'm really richer,
but l don't--

826
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:06,239
What's the matter with you?
You're gonna kill this man!

827
01:08:06,348 --> 01:08:08,407
l'm sorry. l'm very sorry.

828
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:12,954
lt was a temporary loss
of sanity. l'm fine now.

829
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:15,281
Please forgive me.
l don't know why l did that.

830
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:18,952
l'm so sorry. Please.
l meant no harm. lt was just--

831
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:22,664
Let me apologize. l apologize.

832
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,858
Sorry. l'm sorry.
Good day. Good day.

833
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:27,265
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

834
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:30,366
But whatever you do, don't ever
argue money with that man.

835
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:32,168
Why did he attack you?

836
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:36,404
l don't know.
Maybe it's because l'm richer.

837
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:46,314
l don't want to hurt you!

838
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:52,987
l'll get him! l'll kill him!

839
01:08:53,262 --> 01:08:56,459
-You OK?
-l'm OK now that he's gone.

840
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:00,196
He's coming back!

841
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:19,753
l'm richer. l'm richer.
l'm richer!

842
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:24,156
That man is crazy!

843
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:26,319
Why do they allow these people
to walk the streets?

844
01:09:26,428 --> 01:09:28,589
They ought to help these people!

845
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:38,172
l made a bet.
l just made a bet.

846
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:40,333
We were just betting.
Just a little bet.

847
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:42,842
l mean, just 'cause
you make a bet...

848
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:45,539
doesn't mean that you have
to lose all your money!

849
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:52,585
l can get it all back.
l was a financial genius.

850
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:55,680
One and one is two.
Two and two is four.

851
01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:59,225
Four and four is three.
l still got it!

852
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:00,295
White!

853
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:03,729
Everybody's wearing white.
We must be at a wedding.

854
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:06,323
We're at a wedding.
We didn't bring anything.

855
01:10:06,435 --> 01:10:08,665
We have to bring something.

856
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:12,298
My car was white.
l had a white Rolls-Royce.

857
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:14,740
Pull over. Let's get
something to eat, huh?

858
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:17,678
Capacity!

859
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:20,874
What do you mean? l've gotta
get this man into emergency.

860
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:25,249
This ward is full!
We have reached capacity!

861
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:28,618
Oh, my God.
We've reached capacity.

862
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:31,249
Sell.
Get me out of the market.

863
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,692
-dump my pork bellies!
-Put him over here!

864
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:35,957
lt's all going bad.
lt's no good.

865
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:39,861
l don't have my money.

866
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:42,233
l don't want to live
without my money!

867
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:45,330
l don't want to live!

868
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:47,708
Life stinks.

869
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:53,271
Yeah, he's right.

870
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:54,815
Life stinks!

871
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:00,618
What is going on here?

872
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:02,553
Life stinks!

873
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:05,320
Give this man 500 milligrams
of dorazine immediately!

874
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:07,827
-Five hundred?
-Yes. He needs it.

875
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,864
Life stinks.

876
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:40,461
Hey, that's my wheelchair.

877
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:42,427
l need this for my patient.

878
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:45,398
Yo, buddy, help me get this guy
out of this chair.

879
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:06,846
-doc.
-Yes?

880
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:11,490
This man is delirious. Give him
500 milligrams of dorazine.

881
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:13,527
-Five hundred?
-He needs it.

882
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:27,669
dr. Kahahn,
this man has the dTs.

883
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:29,505
He'll be fine.

884
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:32,307
But just in case, give him
500 milligrams of dorazine.

885
01:12:32,414 --> 01:12:34,314
-Five hundred, doctor?
-He needs it.

886
01:12:34,249 --> 01:12:36,809
Yes, doctor.

887
01:12:40,322 --> 01:12:44,383
Well, here's a new one.
What do we have here?

888
01:12:44,326 --> 01:12:47,261
Have l given this patient
any penicillin or antibiotics?

889
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:48,455
no, doctor.

890
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:50,759
Then give him five hundred
milligrams of dorazine.

891
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:52,800
-Five hundred?
-Yes. l'm a doctor.

892
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:54,493
-l know what l'm doing.
-dr. Kahahn.

893
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:57,037
l'm coming! Am l the only doctor
in this hospital?

894
01:12:57,306 --> 01:13:00,833
dr. Kahahn, funeral chapel,
line three one four.

895
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:22,320
dr. Kahahn! This patient
is cyanotic. He's turning blue.

896
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:26,325
This man's been overmedicated.
Take him to l.C.U. immediately.

897
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:28,634
Yes, doctor.
Give me a hand, please.

898
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:32,867
How does a thing
like this happen?

899
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:01,395
Pepto.

900
01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:08,170
l know you want to give up,
but you're wrong.

901
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:12,805
Even without money,
life is good.

902
01:14:15,384 --> 01:14:21,880
no? What about when
you didn't eat for two days...

903
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:26,461
and then you had your
first big meal at the mission?

904
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:28,291
Wasn't that good?

905
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:35,469
Remember the other night...

906
01:14:35,571 --> 01:14:41,908
when we drank champagne
and danced...

907
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:44,001
and rolled around in rags?

908
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:52,381
l know they're only moments...

909
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:55,490
but that's all life is...

910
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:58,218
just a bunch of moments.

911
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:02,355
Most of them are lousy...

912
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:05,797
but once in a while,
you steal a good one.

913
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:22,274
Come on.

914
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:26,376
Come on back to me.

915
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:31,482
don't be such a selfish bastard.

916
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:35,222
You're the only person
l can stand.

917
01:15:38,634 --> 01:15:40,568
don't leave me.

918
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:46,469
l love you.

919
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:50,341
Please, don't leave me.

920
01:16:04,593 --> 01:16:06,652
Molly.

921
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:11,855
You're crying.

922
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:16,333
What happened?

923
01:16:16,438 --> 01:16:18,906
Somebody die?

924
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:25,905
Somebody lived.

925
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:37,822
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
the greatest day of my life.

926
01:16:40,395 --> 01:16:42,625
This is the moment l dreamed of
ever since l grew up...

927
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:47,600
on these poverty-ridden streets
as a poor, hungry child.

928
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:51,832
l'm all right.

929
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:57,871
Where else but in America...

930
01:16:57,980 --> 01:17:01,575
could a poor, deprived boy from
this very same neighborhood...

931
01:17:01,683 --> 01:17:05,278
return one day to destroy it?

932
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,190
lt's good to be alive!

933
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:19,427
There are so many things
you can't do when you're dead.

934
01:17:19,534 --> 01:17:23,368
-Remember what you said?
-What?

935
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:27,238
What you said in the hospital.

936
01:17:27,342 --> 01:17:30,175
What?

937
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:32,212
That you love me.

938
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:41,721
lt's words, just words.
''Love'' is just another word.

939
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:43,950
You meant it.

940
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:48,286
Let the demolition begin.

941
01:17:50,032 --> 01:17:52,432
-nunzio!
-Yo!

942
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:04,335
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
to celebrate and cut the dust...

943
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:08,246
l salute you with the finest
champagne money can buy.

944
01:18:22,631 --> 01:18:24,292
What's that?

945
01:18:33,742 --> 01:18:36,438
Oh, man!
You should see them over there.

946
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:39,309
The big shots are having
a party in our neighborhood...

947
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:42,212
and we ain't invited.
l feel slighted.

948
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:44,875
l mean, they got all types
of food and champagne.

949
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:47,284
lt's so big,
they're putting it on TV.

950
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:48,947
Come on, Pepto. Hurry up.

951
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:52,920
We gotta find a new place
before the good ones are taken.

952
01:18:53,028 --> 01:18:55,462
no! no more running!

953
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,429
They forced me
to live in the crap...

954
01:18:57,532 --> 01:19:01,366
and now they want
to take the crap away? no!

955
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:03,233
What do you mean, ''no''?

956
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:05,272
Here's what l mean.

957
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:11,809
Stop!

958
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:18,284
Wait! Stop!
don't go! don't give up!

959
01:19:18,386 --> 01:19:19,785
This is America!

960
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:23,221
Every person has a right
to have a place to live!

961
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:24,952
Come! Join me!

962
01:19:25,227 --> 01:19:28,526
Let's fight for our rights!
Let's take our homes back!

963
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:30,928
Follow me!

964
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:42,442
Wait! There's a party
back there.

965
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:46,207
-Free food for everyone!
-And booze.

966
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:48,646
Stop! Wait! Listen to me!

967
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,945
Wait! Stop!

968
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:54,416
lf we run now,
we'll always be running.

969
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:58,254
lt's got to stop somewhere.

970
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,419
They've got TV news cameras
down there.

971
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:03,293
Let's show the world
what they're doing to us.

972
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:07,632
Come on!

973
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:45,765
The nicest neighborhood.

974
01:20:45,874 --> 01:20:47,501
Shall we dance?

975
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:52,906
-do you come here often?
-Oh, my God!

976
01:20:54,282 --> 01:20:56,614
l've never seen anything
like this before.

977
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:58,412
Hey! Just a minute!

978
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:03,389
How dare you break in like this!

979
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:05,925
Who do you people think you are?

980
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:07,392
Get out of here!

981
01:21:07,495 --> 01:21:09,224
l'm talking to you.

982
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:10,730
Turn around, you idiot!

983
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:12,299
do you hear me?

984
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:13,667
Are you crazy?

985
01:21:13,768 --> 01:21:15,360
do you know who l am?

986
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:17,870
do you have any idea
who you're dealing with?

987
01:21:17,973 --> 01:21:20,339
You are in serious trouble,
my friend.

988
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:22,266
You are trespassing
on private property.

989
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:24,345
l can throw you in jail!
l can have you arrested!

990
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:26,437
You will lose
your voting privilege!

991
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:29,210
Have you ever been in jail?

992
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:34,977
-Mmm! Chicken!
-How dare you!

993
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:46,291
Oh, boy!

994
01:21:59,681 --> 01:22:03,879
When my husband divorced me,
l thought my life was over.

995
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:06,214
lt's just beginning.

996
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:21,299
Hey, Willy, listen.

997
01:22:24,906 --> 01:22:27,272
Gotcha.

998
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:29,400
...ceremony has erupted
into pandemonium.

999
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:32,241
As of yet, l'm not exactly sure
what's happening.

1000
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:34,315
This is Fumes
reporting from downtown...

1001
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:36,247
and l'll tell you
what's happening.

1002
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:38,579
The rich and famous are having
a party in our neighborhood...

1003
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:41,247
and we fucked it up.
Back to you.

1004
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:45,917
ls this going out live?
Are we live? Oh, jeez!

1005
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:53,301
My legs!
You've cut off my legs!

1006
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:54,663
Oh, my God!

1007
01:22:55,937 --> 01:22:58,701
Oh, my God! Look what l've done!

1008
01:23:00,608 --> 01:23:03,577
Get me a doctor!
Get me an ambulance!

1009
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:11,817
Look what you've done!
Look at my legs!

1010
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,911
Stay right here!
l'll be right back.

1011
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:22,554
This party has disintegrated
into utter chaos.

1012
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:24,859
There are bums eating
pate de foie gras.

1013
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:32,205
My God!
That's Goddard Bolt!

1014
01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:39,508
He's not the only one who can
run one of those damn machines.

1015
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:41,206
no comment.

1016
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:49,215
Look!

1017
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:14,604
We had a bet, remember?

1018
01:25:16,511 --> 01:25:18,979
Maybe this
will jar your memory!

1019
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:26,886
Jarred! Jarred!
Yes, my memory is jarred!

1020
01:25:26,988 --> 01:25:30,355
Yes! Yes! l can remember.
lt's all coming back to me now.

1021
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:32,452
You won the bet.

1022
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:38,262
lt's all coming back to me.

1023
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:41,335
You won the bet,
and l lost the bet...

1024
01:25:41,436 --> 01:25:43,802
and this is all yours
because l don't want this.

1025
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:45,797
l'll be fine when l get down.

1026
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:49,398
l'll be a gentleman.
Just let me down.

1027
01:25:49,477 --> 01:25:51,001
That was two weeks ago.

1028
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:53,008
Today,
in an extraordinary decision...

1029
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:55,215
Judge Reynolds
ruled from the bench...

1030
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:57,375
in the Bolt vs. Crasswell
lawsuit...

1031
01:25:57,519 --> 01:26:00,886
and it was a day of
total victory for Goddard Bolt.

1032
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:03,623
Bolt has announced
he intends to clean up...

1033
01:26:03,725 --> 01:26:06,694
the slum area he now owns
and allow it to remain...

1034
01:26:06,794 --> 01:26:08,523
for the homeless who live there.

1035
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:12,225
He plans to build a large park,
no-cost housing...

1036
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:14,824
and a new free medical
and counseling clinic...

1037
01:26:14,936 --> 01:26:17,302
for the destitute of the area.

1038
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:20,298
And, believe it or not,
at this very moment...

1039
01:26:20,408 --> 01:26:23,309
Goddard Bolt is actually
marrying the bag lady...

1040
01:26:23,411 --> 01:26:25,402
he met while living
on the streets.

1041
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:28,243
We don't know where
the wedding is taking place...

1042
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:31,250
but with Goddard Bolt's
reputation for extravagance...

1043
01:26:31,386 --> 01:26:35,880
it must be at a very chic,
elegant, and exclusive location.

1044
01:26:50,772 --> 01:26:53,332
Too fast, you jackass!

1045
01:26:54,509 --> 01:26:57,342
-Thanks for standing up for me.
-l'll miss you, buddy.

1046
01:27:09,257 --> 01:27:13,159
Good-bye, everybody.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1047
01:27:13,261 --> 01:27:14,353
Stop!

1048
01:27:24,806 --> 01:27:26,865
Bye! Good luck, God bless!

1049
01:27:26,975 --> 01:27:29,944
Bye, children, and may the Lord
bless your union.

1050
01:27:30,211 --> 01:27:31,974
And have a wonderful honeymoon.

1051
01:27:45,893 --> 01:27:47,656
Hey, stop that!

1052
01:27:54,736 --> 01:27:56,397
What are you doing?

1053
01:27:56,504 --> 01:27:59,837
You may not know this, but these
cans are worth a lot of money.

1054
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:03,507
Get in that car.

1055
01:28:19,694 --> 01:28:22,219
What do you think you're doing?
That's my car!

1056
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:24,264
l paid good money for that car!

1057
01:28:24,365 --> 01:28:25,889
l must've left the keys
in there!

1058
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,763
Hey, wait a minute! Stop!

1059
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:30,838
What kind of a neighborhood
is this? There's no cop around!

1060
01:28:30,938 --> 01:28:33,202
Somebody call 91 1 !

1061
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:35,173
Quick! Hold it!

1062
01:28:35,276 --> 01:28:37,676
Hold it! Somebody stop him!

1063
01:28:37,779 --> 01:28:40,714
Where's a cop?
Where's my--

1064
01:28:42,283 --> 01:28:45,446
-Will you leave me alone?!
-lt's him!

1065
01:28:45,586 --> 01:28:47,178
Get out of my life!

1066
01:28:51,592 --> 01:28:52,957
l'll kill you!

1067
01:28:53,227 --> 01:28:55,695
He's crazy! That guy's crazy!

1068
01:28:55,797 --> 01:28:56,786
l'll get you!

1069
01:30:55,797 --> 01:31:56,786
Ripped by Pendalf.
