{2703}{2785}Damn!The chicken is gone!|Get her,mister!
{3424}{3518}If the picture is good|I will work in a newspaper.
{3570}{3662}You are playing with your life|for a photrograph?
{3674}{3753}Do you think that i am in the mood|to see the fucking gang?
{3802}{3857}The chicken bro!
{3951}{4021}The chicken i told you,asshole!
{4068}{4109}Get the chicken!
{4578}{4632}If Ze gets you,|you're dead.
{4666}{4716}He has to find me first.
{4948}{5006}Hey,kid!Get the chicken!
{5099}{5171}-The cops!|-Don't run!
{5289}{5355}Butthead! Mothefucker!
{5387}{5448}A photo might|have changed my life. . .
{5455}{5521}but in the City of God,|if you run you're dead. . .
{5540}{5582}...if you stay,|you're dead again.
{5628}{5703}It has always been like that|since i was a kid.
{5787}{5852}IN THE 60's
{6018}{6114}-You are so useless.|-Fetch the ball.
{6200}{6272}Hey, kid! Fetch the ball .
{6378}{6417}you are not giving it to me?
{6440}{6524}Fuck you.|What's your name?
{6547}{6608}Sorry,I forgot to introduce myself.
{6608}{6643}My name is Rocket.
{6649}{6755}Do not give the ball|to the kid,he stinks.
{6816}{6849}This is Hairy.
{6857}{6953}The story of the City of God|starts with him.
{7048}{7159}However, Hairy's story|is connected to Mortes Trio story.
{7176}{7289}The truck is comming.|Why are you fooling around?
{7389}{7471}TRIO MORTES STORY
{7610}{7699}Trio Mortes|the legend of the City of God!
{7703}{7728}Hairy.
{7750}{7785}Snatcher.
{7809}{7840}And Naive.
{7889}{8012}With them,Kid and|Benny,Hairy's brother .
{8062}{8145}I did not have enough courage|to go with my brother.
{8350}{8393}Come Naive!
{8418}{8447}Let's go!
{8917}{8978}Stop or I'll shoot,|fucking asshole.
{8990}{9031}Get out!
{9097}{9184}Quickly,asshole.|Give me the money!
{9238}{9282}Who wants gass?
{9472}{9553}Oh!You wanna die for money|that is not yours?
{9567}{9610}Lots of money here!
{9728}{9786}Damn!The cops!
{10044}{10122}Quickly!|They are everywhere!
{10826}{10891}Then, i thought that|Trio Mortes. . .
{10898}{10960}was the toughest gang |in Rio.
{11071}{11131}But they were just amateurs.
{11217}{11276}Even my bro|Naive.
{11283}{11410}Give these to dad|but do not tell him it's from me.
{11488}{11562}Hairy, come and see what I've got!
{11993}{12093}We came to the City of God|to find paradise.
{12110}{12183}Lot of people were homeless|due to the floods...
{12189}{12285}and the fire|they set on ghetto.
{12311}{12363}They are going to bring electricity!
{12368}{12486}The big bosses however|didn't like the homeless.
{12498}{12596}Without electricity,without|roads,without busses.
{12604}{12694}The rich people...|They don't give a damn about us
{12700}{12805}It has nothing to do|with the Rio De Janeiro you see in postcards.
{13219}{13283}Do you think i am going to be|a lifeguard when i grow up?
{13290}{13315}I don't know.
{13336}{13402}It is better to be a|lifeguard than a fisherman.
{13411}{13465}I don't want to be a fisherman,|I will stink.
{13485}{13539}-Are you insulting your father?|-No.
{13575}{13624}-What do you want to become?
{13641}{13739}I sure don't want to be a gangster|or a cop.
{13775}{13809}I do not want to get killed.
{13939}{13981}Drop it,Kid.
{14010}{14085}Are you pointing a gun at me?
{14095}{14142}The kid is with me.
{14171}{14231}I am a gangster too.
{14249}{14355}-Not many bottles in it.|-We rob trucks every day.
{14405}{14519}We have to hit a rich|house to get out of here.
{14529}{14615}No, you have to|follow my plan .
{14645}{14715}Look who's talking!
{14889}{14969}He is so stoned, he|doesn't know what he is talking about!
{14988}{15082}You are both not as|worthy as the kid.
{15145}{15215}What are you thinking,Kid?
{15219}{15332}The gun doesn't make you a robber.|You need ideas.
{15405}{15440}The kid had ideas.
{15514}{15556}Is this the Motel?
{15567}{15666}We get the money and leave.|No killings!
{15672}{15758}-Give it to me.|-Leave me alone!
{15827}{15882}Don't you give this|shit to me!
{15892}{15941}You're acting like a baby.
{15941}{16021}-Here's yours.|-Awesome!
{16099}{16239}Do not be hasty.You're staying here|to look out.
{16248}{16312}If you see cops,|shoot that window.
{16320}{16363}Why doesn't he stay in the look-out?
{16373}{16468}This was my plan.|He is good for nothing!
{16493}{16587}Ok,you had the idea.|But you're just a kid!
{16623}{16665}Cover us.
{16713}{16814}Your turn is going to come.|Don't be so hasty.
{16844}{16875}Stay here.
{16992}{17042}This is a hold up, bitch .
{17158}{17268}You should be at school|or at work.
{17370}{17414}You do not look like robbers.
{17421}{17466}Shut up,bitch!
{17479}{17522}Ok,Snatcher?
{17586}{17613}Are we going in?
{17748}{17863}-I did not order anything.|-It's on the house!Your money!
{17916}{17978}Take it easy.All I want is your money.
{18303}{18392}Hey, pal!|What is this mess?
{18464}{18518}Are you a church boy?
{18604}{18632}Give it to me!
{18726}{18784}You are old,and ugly.
{18798}{18847}Do you want to fuck her?
{19039}{19100}Police!Let's beat it!
{19217}{19298}Take the car.|I'm gonna bring the kid.
{19562}{19644}-It went wrong.The kid is missing!|-They are shooting,let's go!
{20307}{20413}-You said you could drive.|-I can,cool down.
{20479}{20529}Turn!Watch it!
{20825}{20918}-You asshole!|-I didn't do it on purpose.
{20977}{21052}Noone saw a thing.|Don't say a word,ok?
{21145}{21190}I twisted my leg!
{21216}{21279}-Naive is hit!|-It hurts!
{21292}{21378}Take him to the woods.|I will try to distract the cops.
{21409}{21435}God help us.
{21577}{21614}Get the phone.
{21640}{21772}Shortie.Infamous in the City.|I will talk about him later.

{23395}{23463}Pitch black.|How do they see?
{23467}{23531}They stole a fortune|from the motel...
{23549}{23660}-What if we took the money?|-Are you out of your mind?
{23682}{23781}I do not want any trouble.|I just want to eliminate them.
{23793}{23914}Since when is it a crime|to steal from niggers and robbers?
{23927}{24006}I know a snitch in the City.
{24689}{24787}Did you hear the shootings?|If I find one of them,i will shoot him!
{25110}{25189}Maracana!|Open the door!

{27953}{28019}He must not have| been a gangster.
{28038}{28111}He is a worker.
{28286}{28377}snatcher was|in God's hands.
{28427}{28527}Hairy was caught|in the net of Bernice.
{28566}{28643}and Naive was|in my father's hands.
{28658}{28790}Why are you doing this?|You will be wotking with me!

{58938}{59028}That night,Kid|satisfied his thirst for blood.
{59036}{59099}knowing that Hairy|would never forgive him.
{59259}{59359}To save himself|he left the City of God.
{59390}{59445}He worked all day for nickels.
{59596}{59657}Kid and Benny|really made it..
{59704}{59761}they had the gift of the killer.
{59777}{59827}-You have more.|-i had the idea.

{60150}{60207}It is our money,Benny.

{63478}{63566}-Especialy coke.|-Needs capital though.
{63572}{63648}We will kill them|and take over.
{63668}{63734}-When do we start|-Now.
{63958}{64054}The light of Satan|brought you here!
{64065}{64233}Why do you live in the City of God|that God has forgotten?

{65447}{65527}this way Kid became Ze|and started the killings.
{65558}{65634}One morning|he took over Andriani's gang..
{65744}{65855}till the night,he ruled|all the ghetto gangs.
{65865}{65974}He did not harm Redhead|since he was Bennie's friens.
{65984}{66077}Only the hideout was left.|but it was an easy job.
{66180}{66208}Who is it?
{66424}{66515}Fuck off kid.Why are you|rushing into my hideout?

{68449}{68538}Pot is wrapped.
{68563}{68715}coke is packed in 10s or 100s.
{68755}{68833}You can be a |carrierist drug dealer.
{68842}{68927}The kids start as messengers.
{68936}{69024}Then they do lookouts.
{69042}{69162}If the cops come|they all vanish.
{69215}{69300}Then you become a dealer.
{69312}{69421}In hard times|the dealer vanishes.
{69423}{69475}Growing up,|you become captain.
{69489}{69580}And if you are good in|math,you become a manager.
{69587}{69642}Bosses right hand.
{69715}{69793}The cops get their cut|and stay out of it.
{69852}{69979}Whan ze came,|all the rivals stopped in the City.
{69992}{70035}You could go there.
{70044}{70142}Bohemian people bought|their dope safely.
{70161}{70264}Lots of people became addicts|and Ze became rich.
{70453}{70540}-Which one should I wear?|-This is cool.
{70556}{70649}If drug dealing was legal|Ze would be given an Oscar.
{70738}{70821}I thought that all these|are very dangerous.
{70836}{70906}However he was everywhere.
{70919}{71026}If i needed pot|I had to visit Redhead .

{80463}{80530}Wanted to become the big ghetto boss.
{80539}{80604}He was looking for the opportunity|to take over Redhead's gang.
