1
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,568
<i>Good morning.
Dynamic Progressive Systems.</i>

2
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,727
<i>Please hold.</i>

3
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,121
It's not a small thing.
5% is a lot.

4
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,442
If you've managed a household with
kids and stuff... 5% is a lot.

5
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,130
You know what, Dan?
Just walk with me.

6
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,964
No. I don't care
if everyone hears us.

7
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,724
You really wanna
do this here? You do?

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,961
I don't wanna be
doing it at all, Chuck.

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,964
It's just that we had terms, and now
you're changing those terms again.

10
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,009
We are restructuring
the department salaries.

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,810
That's just the bottom line.
That's the way it is.

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,803
I know it's not
what you want to hear.

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,566
Dan, just walk with me.

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,688
A little annoying.
What?

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,046
It's just a little annoying.

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,009
"Walk with me."
You say that a lot.

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,810
It's stuff like
that you say, you know.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,240
That's why Brian Peters
wrote "You're an asshole"

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,481
on your parking curb thing.

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,481
What the fuck, Dan?

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,321
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,164
Do you really wanna challenge
me in public, Dan?

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,084
This was my best year.

24
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,129
I am an asshole, Dan,
because I have to make

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,043
decisions to keep
the company strong.

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,967
You make a living
from this company.

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,326
You're replaceable, frankly.

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,081
If you were to leave,
Dynamic would continue.

29
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,010
So, don't minimize
my company's interests.

30
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,845
Now, if you would please, as
I said before, walk with me.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,286
We can discuss
this in my office.

32
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,090
Chuck, just because
you caught me...

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,521
which is, granted,
a pretty big feat...

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,284
in a trust fall
at the company retreat...

35
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,520
which you make us all go to...

36
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,120
and that I don't like, by the way,
that nobody here really likes.

37
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,281
Nobody does.
Right, Russell?

38
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,361
I like them.
Russell is a team player.

39
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,204
Russell is
a beaten-down dog.

40
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,407
You're Mr. Negative.

41
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,286
Are you making less?

42
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,528
I'm a sales manager, Dan.

43
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,449
You want a bigger slice of the
pie, start your own company.

44
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,641
Oh, I've been
thinking about it.

45
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,921
Everybody thinks about it...

46
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,371
but don't bitch when the
people who actually do it...

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,607
pay themselves
what they deserve.

48
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,128
I have been in airports for two
days, preparing a deal for you.

49
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,487
I came in here
just to get a bagel,

50
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,722
because I haven't had
a meal since Tuesday.

51
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,770
And then, you tell me I'm gonna
have to take 5% less this year?

52
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,410
I don't want new terms, Chuck.

53
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,244
I want to be able to see
my kids sometimes.

54
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,640
The old "kid" card.

55
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,801
Strong.

56
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,243
I'm gonna do it.

57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,565
Really?

58
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,087
You're gonna go up against
me and Dynamic?

59
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,086
Yeah. I will see you in the field.
You should look for me.

60
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,600
Because I'll be the guy
in first who's happy.

61
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,880
I think you're better off for
me than against me, Dan.

62
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,926
Well, I actually have my own
ideas on how to do this job.

63
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,402
It doesn't involve any of
that "trust fall" shit.

64
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,807
Okay. Game on.

65
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,844
Game on.

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,480
By the way,
anyone here wanna join me?

67
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,284
There's a lot of
great people here.

68
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,481
How about it? Come on.

69
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,449
Any of you guys wanna build
a total starship with me?

70
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,284
"Starship"?

71
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah, I'm just riffing, here.

72
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,765
I wasn't planning on founding
my own company here today...

73
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,331
but if anyone wants
to play a key role...

74
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,609
in a new mineral sales company
that does it the right way...

75
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,841
then walk through
that door with me,

76
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,291
because there is
a place for you.

77
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,205
Guys!

78
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,681
Men!

79
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,166
We're doing this.

80
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,287
Doing what?

81
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,400
Boarding the starship. Starting
this new adventure together.

82
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,881
Uh, I'm just walking to my car.

83
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,361
Because I just got let go...

84
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,965
because of some
mandatory age limit.

85
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,687
Oh.

86
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,051
Do you still wanna work?

87
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,362
Well, I'm just 67. Yeah!

88
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,806
I'm not the Crypt Keeper.

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,321
All right, great!
Come work with me.

90
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,164
We'll drop these guys.
Yeah!

91
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,887
Let's drop these pussies!

92
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,441
Right!

93
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,647
Look at us.
We're standing here.

94
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,846
We're synergizing already.

95
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,002
I'm excited.
Thank you.

96
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,165
How about you, young buck, huh?

97
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,322
Are you starshipping with us?
Yeah.

98
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,045
What did you do at Dynamic?

99
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,487
Uh... Um... No.
I don't work there.

100
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,801
You just walked out of there.

101
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,689
Well, I interviewed.

102
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,410
But you got a box
with office belongings.

103
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,485
Yeah. I brought it to the
interview to show confidence.

104
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,525
Do you have any
sales experience?

105
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,205
Yes, I do.

106
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,930
Great.
Foot Locker.

107
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,651
And reasons for leaving?

108
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,165
I don't like feet.

109
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,685
But I do like people.

110
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,201
I'm good with people.
It's for real, it's true.

111
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,609
Do you work hard?
Yeah.

112
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,721
Like, what's "hard"?

113
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,371
The hardest.

114
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,204
Don't just say it because you
think I want to hear it.

115
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,727
No, it's true.
Whatever you need.

116
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,886
All right.

117
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,164
If you're willing to try,
I'll turn you into an animal.

118
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,561
Hop in. Come on, young
buck, we're doing it.

119
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,688
I'm willing!
Let's go.

120
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,001
All right.

121
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,561
Let's hit Dunkin' Donuts,
and we'll launch this thing.

122
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,921
Good.

123
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,964
<i>I know we've had
a little dry spell...</i>

124
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,964
but I'm proud to announce
that we got this deal.

125
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,640
Bill said, "Fly up,
let's shake hands."

126
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,000
Fuck, yes!

127
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,647
Oh, excuse me.

128
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,485
I'm sorry about
the "fuck."

129
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,926
I get to go on a trip?

130
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,047
Yeah.

131
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,964
Overnight?

132
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,281
Is this your first
business trip, Mike?

133
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,441
Yeah.

134
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,921
You didn't have any
Foot Locker business trips?

135
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,770
No. They would
all just come to me.

136
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,810
Yeah. All right,
we're going on a trip.

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,163
Will things happen?

138
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,163
Like, explers?

139
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,444
"Explers"?
Yeah.

140
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,443
Can you use it in a sentence?

141
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,969
"We're gonna go on a business
trip and have explers."

142
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,327
"Exploits"?

143
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,925
Exploits.

144
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,650
No, there won't be any exploits.
Just up and back.

145
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,484
I got too much stuff at home.

146
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,483
You can have them,
after we close the deal.

147
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,124
Is it just us going up there, or
are they bringing up a fluffer?

148
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,130
Just us, free and clear.
What's a "fluffer"?

149
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,768
When a company wants
to do a sweetheart deal

150
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,604
with a friend or something...

151
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,525
they generally
pretend to negotiate

152
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,120
with another company,
right to the end.

153
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,486
Just to make it look legit.

154
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,971
Well, this one's all ours.

155
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,201
Come on.

156
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,125
Tomorrow, we are going
on a business trip.

157
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,320
Let's go close this thing.

158
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,521
Go get them, Dan.

159
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,206
I feel good about this one.
You got a strong number set.

160
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,646
I appreciate that, Don.

161
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,450
You've been here
since the beginning.

162
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,760
After we close this, we're
gonna get an actual office.

163
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,009
Hey, Paul we need to talk.

164
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,526
I'm headed off to Portland.

165
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,247
Oh, I'm sorry.

166
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,164
I didn't mean to surprise you.
Everything all right?

167
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,408
I'm doing stuff.
That's cool.

168
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,369
Lookit, "doing stuff"
is natural.

169
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,409
Dad...
I used to "do stuff."

170
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,484
I used to "do stuff" 3 times a day.
And I still "do stuff."

171
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,722
Dad. I don't "do
stuff" as much as I used to...

172
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,083
because now I'm tired
from doing other stuff.

173
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,651
But there's no crime, here.

174
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,002
There's not gonna be a trial.
Nothing happened.

175
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,920
I don't even know
what we were talking about.

176
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,001
When I was your age...

177
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,208
we used to get these
magazines for my sisters...

178
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,885
that would be like
a lingerie or swimsuit...

179
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,007
No, that's not...

180
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,686
But now you go online, you
see a clown fuck an alpaca.

181
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,887
I don't watch that, Dad.

182
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,247
It's not a big deal.
It's just an easy thing.

183
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,327
I want you to get back
to doing it,

184
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,487
but you should do it
in the bathroom...

185
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,840
because you can't lock
this door.

186
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,450
And your sister could walk in
and it's no good.

187
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,090
So, just do it
somewhere else, okay?

188
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,044
Yeah.
Just keep a lid on it.

189
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,562
Like a gentleman does. A
gentleman celebrates his body.

190
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,927
You know that Walt Whitman
poem, "Song of Myself"?

191
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,640
We don't need to
talk about it anymore.

192
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,887
It's a song. Walt Whitman,
he celebrates his body.

193
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,730
You're celebrating your body.

194
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,450
So, I don't think
it's a big deal.

195
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,241
Okay.

196
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,402
I'm gonna be back tomorrow. I'm
just going up for the handshake.

197
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,925
And when I come home...

198
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,923
you are gonna come out of
this room for a little bit...

199
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,560
and me and you, just me and
you, we're gonna hang out.

200
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,205
Okay, you're hugging me.

201
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,361
I don't know what's
going on with your hands.

202
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,726
Get back to the computer.

203
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,644
Bye, Dad.
Bye.

204
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,642
Can we deal with the whole
private school thing today?

205
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,161
Do you mean,
like the pros and cons?

206
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,288
No, we did the pros and cons.
It was all pros.

207
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,283
I meant paying for it.

208
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,681
You know I'm leaving, right?
Portland, for the handshake.

209
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,290
I have 20 minutes to pack.

210
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,807
Yeah. Remember we were gonna
talk to Paul today, though...

211
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,088
about why he's been
so withdrawn.

212
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,366
Can we FaceTime that?

213
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,641
Can it be today?

214
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,290
Yeah. This is the big one.

215
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,925
When are you back?
Tomorrow, before dinner.

216
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,809
We just gotta go there and shake hands.
It's all done.

217
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,121
What do you got going today?

218
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,481
I was probably
going to go to work,

219
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,130
and then maybe
raise our children.

220
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,810
Sounds good.
Wait, eat!

221
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,008
I have to put these reports
in my power spread.

222
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,931
Men over 40 can suffer from fainting
spells if they skip meals...

223
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,168
and have high stress levels,
and poor muscle tone.

224
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,121
I have to pack.

225
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,328
Hey, Dad.
Hey.

226
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,130
Are you going on a trip?

227
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,486
I am, yeah.

228
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,801
You wanna help me out, here?

229
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,644
I'll show you what
I always bring with me.

230
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,650
Space for my running gear here.
Book goes here.

231
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,167
That's all you do
on your business trips?

232
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,890
Read and run?
Yep.

233
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,007
And do business.

234
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,441
Grab some running gear out of
the closet and help me pack.

235
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,005
Okay.
Love you.

236
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,808
Can I ask you a question
before you go?

237
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,121
Honey, my plane's gonna...

238
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,646
Is it a little question?

239
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,366
Kind of.

240
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,689
Okay, yeah.
What is your little question?

241
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,208
When I go to school, I don't
like to go to school at all.

242
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,650
It makes my stomach hurt.
The jokes hurt my feelings.

243
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,041
I cry in the bathroom,
and pretend to poop for...

244
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,850
I don't know, two hours.

245
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,490
That's not even...

246
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,880
Is that a question?

247
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,844
Okay. I know that school
can be hard, honey.

248
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,002
But you gotta go,
or you'll be a moron.

249
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,009
Did you do my
daddy homework thing?

250
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,764
Yes, I have not.

251
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,285
But I'm tweaking it in my mind,

252
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,124
and I will figure
it out on my trip.

253
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,001
<i>Okay, I have 2 seconds, here.
"Your daddy."</i>

254
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,400
<i>Why is this so hard?</i>

255
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,085
<i>"Your daddy is..."</i>

256
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,282
<i>I pretty much
just work these days, sorry.</i>

257
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,401
<i>Selling swarf.</i>

258
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,685
<i>That's metal residue left over after
the construction of large objects...</i>

259
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,205
<i>like the Golden Gate...</i>

260
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,724
<i>Never mind,
it's fucking boring.</i>

261
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,685
<i>Anyway, Daddy's been working to
get the starship off the ground.</i>

262
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,880
<i>That's from a team-building thing.
Our version.</i>

263
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,246
<i>We went to the batting cages.</i>

264
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,401
<i>I thought it was
a good place...</i>

265
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,120
<i>to teach the guys about being
aggressive and taking what's yours.</i>

266
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,528
<i>Crowding the plate,
in a business sense.</i>

267
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,722
<i>But we nailed a big deal,
and we're travelling today...</i>

268
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,600
<i>in the time-honored ritual
of the handshake.</i>

269
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,641
<i>Which is good, because it's
been a down year, swarf-wise.</i>

270
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,881
<i>I really need this deal.</i>

271
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,963
<i>I'm stalling like a freak on
this private school thing...</i>

272
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,646
<i>because I can't afford it
without this handshake.</i>

273
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,450
<i>And I don't want
your mom to know.</i>

274
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,410
<i>But she's gonna catch me soon
because she's smarter than I am.</i>

275
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,607
<i>Probably, that's not what
you're looking for.</i>

276
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,240
Why do males go
on a business trip?

277
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,483
To bring home the kill,
and dig the night.

278
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,802
Going to Portland,
Timothy, not Vegas.

279
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,604
And aren't you 72?

280
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,605
I'm 67.

281
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,121
What do you mean,
"bring home the kill"?

282
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,282
Traditionally, even way back...

283
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,967
guys would leave their caves with
a pointy stick or something.

284
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,283
Go out, get it done,
bring it home.

285
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,846
And the, "dig the night" part?

286
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,651
Well, then they'd stay on a little
longer than they needed to...

287
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,167
and fuck around a little bit.

288
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,281
Traditionally.

289
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,602
Holy shit.
"Trunkman, Daniel."

290
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,683
I'm next on
the upgrade list, boys.

291
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,650
I've flown 31 times this last
year making this goddamn deal.

292
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,121
Never once have they ever
said, "Daniel Trunkman."

293
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,011
Say "Daniel Trunkman."
Come on.

294
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,525
Say it.

295
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,161
Danielle Trunkman.

296
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,051
Yes!
Hi.

297
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,009
It's "Daniel,"
not "Danielle."

298
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,081
Thank you very much.

299
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,248
I'm gonna go
obviously to the front.

300
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,441
You guys go around the back.

301
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,720
Please.
Thank you, sir.

302
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,325
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, welcome on board</i>

303
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,528
<i>US Midland
Airlines Flight 3257...</i>

304
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,330
<i>with service
to Portland, Maine.</i>

305
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,806
<i>In preparation for takeoff...</i>

306
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,280
<i>all carry-on items should be
placed in the overhead bins...</i>

307
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,731
<i>or under the seat
in front of you.</i>

308
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,211
I've never been upgraded.

309
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,164
That's all right.

310
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,121
In 12 years.

311
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,526
That's cool.

312
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,365
Ordinarily, I'd like to give you
my seat, like this guy did.

313
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,080
But I, uh...

314
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,210
I can't honor you on this
flight, because I have to...

315
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,045
finish some important
presentation prep...

316
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,682
on some cap-down brokerage recaps
that just need some tweaking.

317
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,686
But I appreciate you.

318
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,403
Thank you. It is an honor
to sit in front of you.

319
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,925
So much.

320
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,245
Okay, please.

321
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,885
I'd like you to have the seat.

322
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,368
Mike, can I say
something to you?

323
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,241
Can you not say your whole
name today, sorry, um...

324
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,562
when we meet
the Benjaminson Group?

325
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,960
Why?

326
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,291
Because, um...

327
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,930
I'm just going to
be honest with you.

328
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,366
I think that when you
say your whole name,

329
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,761
it causes people
to lose focus on...

330
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,410
pertinent business stuff.

331
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,927
Why would my name
cause people to

332
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,446
lose focus on
pertinent business stuff?

333
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,650
Say it.

334
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,040
Mike Pancake.

335
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,561
I just forget.

336
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,803
So, uh, yeah. That's all.

337
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,567
You can say, "Mike." Just
don't say the breakfast part.

338
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,291
FaceTime time.

339
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,405
Hey, Dad. Hey, buddy.
Hey, Trunkmans.

340
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,608
<i>Where have you been, Dan? I've
been trying you for two hours.</i>

341
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,802
Well, I was just in the sky,
I just turned my...

342
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,645
Paul was arrested.
There's a police report.

343
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,404
They said he was shoplifting.

344
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,250
<i>What?</i>
I sent you an email.

345
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,528
<i>Okay. I have it open
right here.</i>

346
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,170
"Suspect Paul William Trunkman"

347
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,969
"was detained
by store security..."

348
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,330
"who found on his person
a five-shade palette of..."

349
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,608
"Show-Stopping Eye Shadows."

350
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,121
Eye shadows?

351
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,010
"The shades in question are Blue Belgian
Frost, Straight-Up Teal, Celeste."

352
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,680
I don't understand. Are
you doing monster makeup?

353
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,046
Movies with the guys?

354
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,329
<i>You mean my friends that I don't
have because I'm a huge goon?</i>

355
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,686
<i>Those guys?</i>

356
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,322
<i>I wanted to put it
on my eyes...</i>

357
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,323
<i>to hang out with the kids
that don't fit in.</i>

358
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,331
<i>The goth kids.</i>

359
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,527
They laughed at me...

360
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,722
because they use dark
colors around their eyes...

361
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,008
and I didn't know you were
supposed to do that...

362
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,366
and I used teal.

363
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,524
<i>I can't even fit in
with the kids...</i>

364
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,367
<i>that don't fit in.</i>

365
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,365
Tough FaceTime.

366
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,443
Dan, we need to talk about pulling
the trigger on private school.

367
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,248
I think he's really isolated
where he is.

368
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,051
And the tuition at
Primmler Day Academy...

369
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,361
is $19,000.

370
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,646
19 thou...

371
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,881
Dan?

372
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,287
Do my homework!

373
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,081
Sweetie, we lost the connection.
Dad's face froze.

374
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,131
We're going to
try him later, okay?

375
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,282
Okay.
Dan?

376
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,283
<i>Who's your daddy?</i>

377
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,882
<i>Your daddy is a man who is
worried about your brother...</i>

378
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,963
<i>because he stands out,
physically.</i>

379
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,610
Hello, welcome to Portland.

380
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,121
<i>That's not easy
at that age...</i>

381
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,405
<i>so Dad's worried about him.</i>

382
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,564
<i>But Dad has to focus on this
important meeting right now.</i>

383
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,246
<i>So, he wants to go on a run
to clear his mind.</i>

384
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,451
<i>But you packed
Mommy's running stuff.</i>

385
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,011
<i>Sports bra.</i>

386
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,242
<i>Scoop Me Up Tank.</i>

387
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,521
<i>Maybe, instead of running...</i>

388
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,166
<i>I'll have a junior wine
from the junior suite fridge.</i>

389
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,243
<i>Smell the roses, you know?</i>

390
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,401
<i>Deal's done.</i>

391
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,767
<i>Just going to
smell one rose, here.</i>

392
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,171
<i>A moment for Dan.</i>

393
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,321
Hey, Dan.

394
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,924
Hey, Chuck.

395
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,601
Ooh.

396
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,205
I've got to go talk
to Benjaminson.

397
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,930
But I will catch you later.

398
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,531
Cheers.

399
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,770
Yeah.

400
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,209
<i>Bill, hey. Dan Trunkman.</i>

401
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,964
I'm sorry,
I'm just a little thrown.

402
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,647
I saw Chuck Portnoy from
Dynamic Progressive Systems...

403
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,767
and she mentioned...

404
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,241
that she's gonna
see you, Bill, also.

405
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,490
Urn, it was my understanding
that we were done, really...

406
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,927
that we were just going to do a
walkthrough for you and shake hands.

407
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,606
Maid service.
Come in.

408
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,766
Anyway, Bill, can you give me a
holler back about this? Thanks.

409
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,771
Good afternoon.

410
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,088
Good afternoon to you.

411
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,890
I'll be out of here
in 15 minutes.

412
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,530
Oh, you live a busy lifestyle?

413
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,048
I'm sorry.
Well, listen.

414
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,726
Sit back, relax,
grab a drink...

415
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,201
and enjoy me cleaning.

416
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,048
And touch yourself
with your hands.

417
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,691
Can you say some things,
while you're tidying, to me?

418
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,890
I've never done this before.

419
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,567
You know, I'm not
seeing enough titty from you.

420
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,169
Make sure that, periodically,
you turn to face me...

421
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,051
so I can see some more
titty from you.

422
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,329
I don't understand.
Are you saying...

423
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,482
to privately touch...

424
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,721
my Denis?

425
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,564
Certainly.

426
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,883
I'd like to try being
someone else for a while.

427
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,761
So, maybe you could
call me "Tony Stark"...

428
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,491
and talk about my iron cock?

429
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,723
Tim. Timothy?
Yeah?

430
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,248
This woman right here
is an actual maid.

431
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,040
The sex maid you hired
is in with me.

432
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,609
You're doing a great job.

433
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,091
Okay, Okay,

434
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,480
Okay-
Okay-

435
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,721
Okay.

436
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,044
Now, let's stop
drinking champagne.

437
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,282
Let's stop buying women.

438
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,965
And let's focus.

439
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,485
This deal may not be done...

440
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,921
and, man, it is imperative
that we shake hands...

441
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,320
Wait.

442
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,601
Sorry.

443
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,444
I don't know what that means.

444
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,081
What what means?

445
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,210
Impera-... The "E" word.

446
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,131
I didn't say an "E" word.

447
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,443
Em-... Empera-...

448
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,364
Emperlat-... Emperlaten?

449
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,931
"Emperlaten"?

450
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,731
Just stay here and don't
do any more weird shit.

451
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,406
I'm gonna go for a run.
I need to clear my head.

452
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,050
Chuck's here.

453
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,565
I really need to run
and focus right now.

454
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,449
Our meeting's in an hour.

455
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,691
I have to go.
It's "emperlaten."

456
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,570
<i>I'm waking up, up on
the floor, still looking perfect</i>

457
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,729
<i>I'm walking out, out through
the door, into the circus</i>

458
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,725
<i>On a roll again</i>

459
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,963
<i>Rock n roll again</i>

460
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,969
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

461
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,560
Dan.

462
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,481
Dan Trunkman.
Hello, mate.

463
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,085
Bill. How are you?

464
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,163
Dan Trunkman
from Apex Select...

465
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,129
Chuck Portnoy from
Dynamic Systems...

466
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,805
who I think you know,
don't you?

467
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,325
I do. Yeah.
We are competitors.

468
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,845
We are?
Direct.

469
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,162
I guess. I hadn't really
noticed, but, okay.

470
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,163
Hmm. And this is Jim Spinch.

471
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,606
Jim.
Hey, Dan.

472
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,000
How are you?
Good, you?

473
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,650
Sorry.
Sure.

474
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,006
Jim's my boss.

475
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,684
Who makes your gear?
What kind of...?

476
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,922
What's the get-up?

477
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,605
Uh, Danish top. Okay.

478
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,368
And the sweats are a riff on, I
think, South American field slacks.

479
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,011
Um...

480
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,442
"Machos," they're called.
Or "Machetes."

481
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,444
My wife has "Machos." Or
"Machetes," I don't know.

482
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,886
I just call them
"Nancy's pants."

483
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,681
Chuck just showed us...

484
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,848
your redbook rates only make
sense if we're doing buybacks.

485
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,731
I'm not doing buyback deals until it's
out the door and we refactor market.

486
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,689
I just wanna be clear
that those are the terms now.

487
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,046
So, Jim, you're opening
the deal back up?

488
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,884
Well, it wasn't
closed quite, Dan.

489
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,691
So, I just wanted to hear you
both under these new terms today.

490
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,080
Just you and Chuck, that's all.

491
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,161
Those pants are so tight,

492
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,571
you'd think I could see
your balls or your dick.

493
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,721
But I don't.

494
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,565
Maybe I shouldn't have
said that, but it's weird.

495
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,961
So, are we going back to our
original brokerage sets?

496
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,201
In fact, is that a crease?

497
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,805
No. I don't have a crease,
thank you.

498
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,246
A slit?
No.

499
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,243
There's space.
There is no space.

500
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,561
There's actually space.
It's alarming.

501
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,920
There's clearly no space.

502
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,088
I'm trying to determine the...

503
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,881
Jim. Are we going to start at
our first rate presentation?

504
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,566
I'm giving you both a clean start.
That's it, yeah.

505
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,082
And you guys know each other?
You and Chuck?

506
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,006
Yeah, we've done
a couple of deals.

507
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,844
And you came together today?

508
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,921
Almost.

509
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,650
I came, then
Jim came on my face.

510
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,051
But thanks for asking, Dan.

511
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,081
Wow.

512
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,931
How wonderfully brassy.
Are you guys coming inside?

513
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,880
I already came inside of Jim,
but thank you for asking.

514
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,451
Jeez, guy.

515
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,760
We're going to eat in here.

516
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,281
Wow.

517
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,529
Chuck, what are you doing?

518
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,127
Here? Now? Chuck?

519
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,691
Well, did you guys
shake hands already...

520
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,803
or was I misled about
the deal being done?

521
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,930
I am here to shake hands.

522
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,001
Oh.

523
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,646
So am I.

524
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,803
I hope it's clear that while there
are higher upfront costs...

525
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,644
than possibly you are
used to or prefer...

526
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,600
these are one-offs
and, over time...

527
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,766
Fuck!

528
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,921
Whoa. You all right?

529
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,606
No. I'm good, I'm good.
I just...

530
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,570
I just had
a stressful afternoon...

531
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,449
and no granola.

532
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,090
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

533
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,960
What was the last thing I said?

534
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,041
Uh, "Fuck."

535
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,681
No. Right before.

536
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,000
Oh, you were talking about having
extremely high upfront costs built in.

537
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,964
I said "extremely"?
You said "extremely."

538
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,326
I'm going to have to
call you out on that, Jim.

539
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,842
I didn't say "extremely" because
I wouldn't characterize our...

540
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,527
My legs feel a little
bit like, uh, Slinkys.

541
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,641
Fuck.

542
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,767
I said that again.

543
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,365
I'm going to sit down.
Sit down.

544
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,204
Yeah. Okay.

545
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,282
Mike, finish.

546
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,201
Sorry.

547
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,441
Hello.

548
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,048
Um, I'm Mineral Deposits Sales
Director at Apex Select, Mike Pancake.

549
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,161
What was your last name?

550
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,487
Pancake.

551
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,801
Like, breakfast?

552
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,721
It's Greek, so...

553
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,961
It's delicious.

554
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,360
Yum.

555
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,531
Are you Steve Toast?

556
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,488
I know this deal is getting close
to the finish line for you...

557
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,324
but when the mineral market
bottomed out in Greece,

558
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,481
it took us all by surprise.

559
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,244
We gotta go back and look at
our whole fourth quarter.

560
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,402
And Chuck and Dynamic, they brought
up some interesting points...

561
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,200
about how they could
help us fourth quarter.

562
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,803
We weren't, you and us,
quite at the handshake stage.

563
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,049
Well, we'll just have to
disagree on that.

564
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,846
Maybe we didn't totally shake.

565
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,241
We definitely grasped
one another's hands.

566
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,289
Now, maybe we didn't
do that small

567
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,249
pump-up-and-down thing
to finish it off.

568
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,447
No, we didn't.

569
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,927
I'm here. Let's pump, Jim.

570
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,001
All right. Hold on, Dan.

571
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,001
What are you talking...?
It's been a year, Jim.

572
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,280
All right, Dan, look. Here's
what we're going to do.

573
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,522
Chuck's presenting
to Dirk Austerlitz in Berlin.

574
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,446
So are we.

575
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,840
Jim said it wasn't necessary,

576
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,046
but I insisted.

577
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,730
So, gear up.

578
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,609
We have to go
right there tomorrow.

579
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,444
I thought we were done.

580
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,080
Yeah.

581
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,088
I've never made
love to a woman.

582
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,366
I made love to my wife,
but I don't love her.

583
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,765
She's cruel.

584
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,564
Didn't you just
order a sex maid?

585
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,042
Oh, yes, but I don't cheat.
I just observe.

586
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,243
But, no,
my wife's the only one.

587
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,442
So, I want to get a divorce.

588
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,321
But I wanna leave her with some money.
A sufficient...

589
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,801
Uh...

590
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,201
And I was hoping that my
commission on this deal

591
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,328
would allow me to do that.

592
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,643
So I could make love just once.

593
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,606
Wheelbarrow position.

594
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,847
It is the one that I
would like to explore.

595
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,322
That position wouldn't...
My wife...

596
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,843
She looks like
a vending machine.

597
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,001
Over there.

598
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,844
She looks just like that.

599
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,806
Your wife's square?

600
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,610
Rectangular, yes.

601
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,286
But vending machines
are square.

602
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,681
That's square?

603
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,964
Kind of square.

604
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,205
That shape there?

605
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,966
Mike, did you go to college?

606
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,602
I did not.

607
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,207
On your resume, it said that
you went to Ithaca College.

608
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,726
No.

609
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,962
I didn't.

610
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,884
I went to a special school.

611
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,523
And I live in
one of those homes

612
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,170
with a lot of other guys...

613
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,970
where they teach you
how to iron

614
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,280
your clothes and stuff.

615
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,051
I'm kind of like
a counselor there.

616
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,724
I'm gonna go get a Pepsi, okay?

617
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,527
I'm losing confidence
in the team.

618
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,570
<i>Your daddy is a man who is
still away to shake hands...</i>

619
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,206
<i>but he has to fly his hand
to Germany now.</i>

620
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,008
<i>I checked Paul's Facebook page.</i>

621
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,003
<i>I walked into
his room yesterday.</i>

622
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,686
<i>He didn't want me
to see something.</i>

623
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,047
<i>I know why now.</i>

624
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,243
"Danke" is "thank you"?

625
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,441
Yeah.

626
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,761
"Danke" is "thank you."

627
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,402
Danke for talking to me.

628
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,925
You're very welcome.

629
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,206
Yeah.

630
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,771
<i>We're down
to the minute, here, Mike.</i>

631
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,366
<i>We have to get to Hamburg
and back in 2 hours.</i>

632
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,367
Why is the GPS in German?

633
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,522
Because I asked
for it in German.

634
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,125
Because we're in Germany.

635
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,601
That's not...
It doesn't work like that.

636
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,043
But don't you need it to have
the German information in it?

637
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,328
Like the German bridges

638
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,970
and the German streets
and such.

639
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,966
The English would have the German
streets in it, and bridges.

640
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,929
They would just
tell you to turn right

641
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,809
and left and shit in English...

642
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,486
so you could understand it.
God damn it, Mike!

643
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,961
I can tell you
what I think it means.

644
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,566
Yeah? You?
Do you speak German?

645
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,326
Well, no.
But I have a feeling.

646
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,561
Ah, great.

647
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,246
Tell me your flugelschlagen
feeling, Mike.

648
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,969
I think it means...

649
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,726
"Hey, man,
you're doing great."

650
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,322
Flugelschlagen.
Yeah, it's like, um...

651
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,608
"Slow down
and enjoy the moment,"

652
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,324
"because everything's
gonna be okay."

653
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,164
Sounds good.

654
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,243
We have to be to Hamburg
and back by 2:00.

655
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,687
So I can't
<i>flugelschlagen</i> right <i>now.</i>

656
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,841
Why Hamburg?

657
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,526
Helen Harlmann. If I can talk her
off her hard lease numbers...

658
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,967
we can drop our margin in
the deal and beat Chuck.

659
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,360
She knows her stuff.

660
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,000
What the fuck does that mean?

661
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,286
See, Pancake?

662
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,488
I don't know...

663
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,971
Let's just get on the Autobahn.

664
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,611
Thank you.

665
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,800
I don't understand you.
I'm sure it wasn't supportive.

666
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,961
It's really hard to concentrate

667
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,805
on revising my number set here, Mike.

668
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,724
Thank you. I'm a guest here
in your land. But thanks.

669
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,362
<i>Flugelschlagen.
Dan? Flugelschlagen.</i>

670
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,564
You should probably not
say any shit to me now.

671
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,721
For now.

672
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,281
Guten Morgen.

673
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,722
Hi, this is Dan Trunkman
from Apex Select.

674
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,120
I was trying to reach
Helen Harlmann.

675
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,846
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.
She's taking a personal day.</i>

676
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,006
Any chance you might be
able to tell me where she is?

677
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,363
Absolutely, we offer
traditional shvitz.

678
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,521
"Steaming."

679
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,481
We're kind of in a hurry, but I think
I have a friend who's shvitzing.

680
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,564
Go on in, if necessary.

681
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,006
Our friend is a woman.

682
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,082
I was hoping maybe
you could go grab her.

683
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,010
It's a unisex shvitz.

684
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,527
Go on in.

685
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,767
Boob. Boobs.

686
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,120
Big boobies, coming right here.

687
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,366
Mike...

688
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,760
It's a pleasure to meet you.

689
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,160
Let me just go find
Helen, take my shot...

690
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,930
and I'll meet you in the lobby
in a few minutes, okay?

691
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,087
Uh, wait.

692
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,603
Maybe we should stay.

693
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,201
To, uh, support you.

694
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,569
And maybe see some vaginas.

695
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,841
This is crunch time, Mike.

696
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,082
We can't go rolling up on
her, three dudes in a suit...

697
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,241
in a steambath.

698
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,329
It's intimidating.
She'll be overwhelmed.

699
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,522
Just for the record,
I'd like to go with you

700
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,965
and support you.

701
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,443
And also see nude women.

702
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,884
But I understand.

703
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,690
But I want to.

704
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,250
Oh, okay.
Just go ahead.

705
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,365
Thank you.
Okay.

706
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,481
Butt cracks!
Look, two butt cracks!

707
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,441
Helen?

708
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,601
Yes?

709
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,290
Dan Trunkman, Apex Select.

710
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,601
<i>You're in my shvitz.</i>

711
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,886
I apologize for that.

712
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,769
I have some numbers

713
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,330
that I think would
make sense for both of us.

714
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,766
It's a bit time-sensitive.

715
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,128
I hope it's worth
the intrusion.

716
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,681
I can tell you're clearly not
in a business frame of mind...

717
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,365
so I'll keep this very simple.

718
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,120
We have to sweeten the package.

719
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,320
We're gonna see Geiger today.

720
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,811
So, if you drop
our lease fees this year,

721
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,121
we'll double your
process fees next year.

722
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,481
Liar.

723
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,440
I mean what I say,
the numbers are...

724
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,767
You intruded my <i>shvitz</i>
to give me numbers...

725
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,810
and deceive and insult me.

726
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,201
I did not mean to insult you.

727
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,169
You're in our place
of openness...

728
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,642
and to hide
your body... Liar.

729
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,489
It's very American.

730
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,524
Are you a shameful pilgrim?

731
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,202
I might be part pilgrim.

732
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,089
You can bring
your numbers here...

733
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,245
but please don't bring
your American prudishness.

734
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,883
It makes me uncomfortable.

735
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,566
Let's get comfortable, Helen.

736
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,843
I dig Europe.

737
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,001
In a big way.

738
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,206
What's not to dig?

739
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,725
The Renaissance.

740
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,966
Sonnets.

741
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,448
Frescoes.

742
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,921
Oil paintings,
paintings of women.

743
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,127
Gorgeous.

744
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,882
Paintings of big women.
Fantastic.

745
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,728
Why did they ever
stop making those?

746
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,327
I'd paint paintings of big
women, if I could paint.

747
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,728
I know you'll be comfortable
with my numbers.

748
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,840
And maybe now you're a
little more comfortable

749
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,445
with this old pilgrim.

750
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,171
Dan Trunkman. Apex Select.

751
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,483
I like what I heard.

752
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,806
I see you brought
more pilgrims.

753
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,323
You guys are supposed
to be in the lobby.

754
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,928
We just came to check
if you were okay.

755
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,090
I can see
your ball sack.

756
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,010
I'm doing business here, Mike.

757
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,407
Oh. Carry on.

758
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,965
It seems we have
an excited pilgrim.

759
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,726
I'm sorry.
Are boners not allowed?

760
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,283
Hopefully,
this is a closed deal.

761
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,041
Deal.

762
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,608
Fuck, yeah!
One, two, three!

763
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,761
Apex Select!

764
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,127
Hell, yes!
That's who we are!

765
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,441
Let's seal this deal.

766
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,844
<i>Hello?
Dan, hey.</i>

767
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,001
Hey, honey!

768
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,167
<i>What's up?</i>

769
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,244
Just on the Autobahn,
hauling ass.

770
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,765
<i>I miss you.</i>

771
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,331
Oh, I miss you too, babe.

772
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,403
<i>I miss you like...</i>

773
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,121
<i>I'm holding the phone with my
left hand, because I'm a rightie.</i>

774
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,285
And my right hand's
making little Dan circles...

775
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,489
Speakerphone is
what you're on right now.

776
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,324
<i>No.
In my business car.</i>

777
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,005
Hi, Susan.
Hi.

778
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,286
Is that Tim?

779
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,602
Yeah. We're all...
Um, Mike's here.

780
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,921
Hello, Susan.

781
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,447
We're all here, hon.
So you can just, uh...

782
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,967
go ahead and hold the phone
with your right hand.

783
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,044
<i>We are headed to the meeting. Okay.
Well, good luck, guys.</i>

784
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,201
All right. Thank you, honey.

785
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,049
I'll call you in a bit.
I love you.

786
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,290
I like to make circles, too.

787
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,169
On my bike.

788
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,041
What the fuck?

789
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,121
The fuck is that?

790
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,167
Is that a fucking reindeer?

791
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,241
Go right at it.
It's gonna dart.

792
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,200
I can't stop. I'm going
a hundred miles an hour.

793
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,561
It's gonna dart
and then you're...

794
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,920
Right at it?
Right at it.

795
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,127
It's gonna dart. Dart.

796
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,281
Fuck!

797
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,010
Have you seen, Mike...

798
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,768
lots of reindeer
darting to and fro...

799
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,566
in St. Louis?

800
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,763
No, I'm sorry.

801
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,527
I just imagined that
I was a reindeer...

802
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,770
and I thought about what I
would do in that situation...

803
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,764
as a reindeer-man.

804
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,326
<i>Once we get there, we got
18 minutes to make our meeting.</i>

805
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,443
Seriously, good work, guys.

806
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,841
Did you narrow this to 17...?
Is that 17%?

807
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,727
Did you get us $1000
of bulk order down?

808
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,770
Yeah, I started working vendors yesterday.
How many did you get down?

809
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,604
39.
Yeah.

810
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,569
What'd you do here?
This is much better.

811
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,762
I figured out a way
to fudge our asset charts.

812
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,611
Not fucked up.
Just fudged.

813
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,450
I really Keeblered it.

814
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,451
We're gonna have
to haul ass, here.

815
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,846
So when that door opens,
it's like

816
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,046
the chute opening
at the Kentucky Derby...

817
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,486
and we're Seabiscuit.

818
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,647
Wait.

819
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,803
But we can't all be Seabiscuit.

820
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,361
All right.
I'm Seabiscuit.

821
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,443
I'll be Northern Dancer.

822
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,284
I like to dance.

823
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,250
Okay, and I'll be Fastee.

824
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,164
All right.
That is not a horse...

825
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,049
<i>But okay, be whoever.
Just run.</i>

826
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,331
How is it a wheelbarrow again?

827
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,647
It's because one person's
legs is being held up.

828
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,926
Like wheelbarrow sticks.

829
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,321
Like the handles
on a wheelbarrow.

830
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,521
Hang on.

831
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,170
Hello?
Hey.

832
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,408
Hey, what's up?
Is everything...?

833
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,050
<i>Yes. Sorry.</i>

834
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,642
There was a bullying
incident at school.

835
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,211
I sent you an email
with a link.

836
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,361
<i>Bess.</i>

837
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,130
Fuck. I'm in the waiting room.

838
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,326
Is she okay?

839
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,527
<i>Yes.</i>

840
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,250
Can you talk to her, please?

841
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,681
Hey, Dad.

842
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,041
<i>Hey, Bess.</i>

843
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,440
Hey, I'm in Germany,

844
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,330
where I am for work still,
a little longer.

845
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,528
<i>I gotta go to this meeting
in just a second...</i>

846
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,290
<i>but, honey, I want you to know</i>

847
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,885
<i>that I'd like to be
with you now.</i>

848
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,604
I bet you're feeling blue.

849
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,921
Yeah.

850
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,003
<i>Yeah, bullies are the worst.</i>

851
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,403
Their parents
are assholes mostly, too.

852
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,403
Honestly.

853
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,005
Don't tell your mom
that I said that.

854
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,050
<i>But they grow up
to have lives, Bess...</i>

855
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,322
<i>without anybody
being able to love them.</i>

856
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,401
<i>It's true.</i>

857
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,120
I love you, honey.

858
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,045
Love you, too, Dad.

859
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,983
<i>All right, I'll try you
guys in a little bit.</i>

860
00:38:40,009 --> 00:38:40,705
<i>Can you tell Mom?</i>

861
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,205
Okay.

862
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,407
Bye.

863
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,765
Nice touch.

864
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,609
Thanks, man.

865
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,249
<i>Wait, what'd you say?</i>

866
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,209
<i>I have a friend
named Ethan.</i>

867
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,249
<i>And you're acting like...</i>

868
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,281
<i>Whoa! Bess is beating
a bully!</i>

869
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,484
<i>Get Off!</i>

870
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,441
<i>Ow!</i>

871
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,241
<i>Stop hitting me!</i>

872
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,284
We gotta get home, man.

873
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,090
Don't say your last name.

874
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,921
Apex Select?

875
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,809
Hi. Yeah.
It's Dan Trunkman.

876
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,564
Yes. Timothy McWinters.

877
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,330
Hey, Mike Pan... ther.

878
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,845
Mike Panther.

879
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,241
Hi.

880
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,289
I was just trying
to reach you. I'm sorry.

881
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,641
We have to push,
Mr. Trunkman,

882
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,085
Mr. McWinters, Mr. Panther.

883
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,287
Push?

884
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,641
Yes, we have to push
your meeting,

885
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,326
if you please,
until Friday, 11:30.

886
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,926
I don't please.

887
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,684
I'm very sorry.

888
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,961
There are no rooms left
in the whole city.

889
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,681
It says that
it's the G8 this week.

890
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,003
Oktoberfest, too.
Folsom Europe.

891
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,322
And the Berlin Marathon.
This week.

892
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,807
What's Folsom Europe?

893
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:31,524
"Largest gay fetish street event in Europe.
25,000 people." Whoa.

894
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,841
Orbitz.

895
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,047
Okay. Yeah.

896
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,561
A room just opened up
at this hotel.

897
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,722
Oh, yeah. It looks
kind of fancy, too.

898
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,611
It's the Dandlin
Annex and the rooms

899
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,842
are "habitable works
of art," it says.

900
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,088
Yeah, cool. Okay.

901
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,567
Okay.

902
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,520
Timothy, we are gonna
share a room, it looks like.

903
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,246
It's the only one
in our budget range.

904
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,210
It's the
Industriepalast Hostel.

905
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,886
A youth hostel?
Uh...

906
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,485
Yes.

907
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,242
Uh, sorry, Dan, but how is
it a wheelbarrow again?

908
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,129
Just the legs are held up.

909
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,362
Like wheelbarrow
handles, man. Fuck!

910
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,761
All right. Sorry.

911
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,566
You guys wanna go over our
numbers one last time tonight?

912
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,129
Yeah, sure.

913
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,567
I met someone on the plane...

914
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,246
and she was gonna show me
around her neighborhood today.

915
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,368
But let's do this.

916
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,805
It's important.

917
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,087
Go.

918
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,242
No, Dan, really, it's not a big deal.
Mike, go.

919
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,084
You did a good job
with your reports.

920
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,242
Yeah?
They're done.

921
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,481
Go.

922
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,926
Yeah.

923
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,889
Go dig the night, Pancake.

924
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,600
"Panther." Nice on that.

925
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,285
Thanks, Dan.

926
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,447
Jungle animal.

927
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,922
Yeah, that's kind
of how I feel here.

928
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,805
Alive and hunting.

929
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,124
Circling for the kill.

930
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,600
Just don't say
that anymore, though.

931
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,682
See you, Dan.

932
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,805
Hey, Dan.

933
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,291
What's up?

934
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,489
Dan...

935
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,165
are you the kind of guy that...

936
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,522
when his girlfriend is trying to
blow him off, doesn't get it?

937
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,284
And still does her
Spanish homework...

938
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,602
while other guys are
getting the good stuff?

939
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,241
What are you talking about?

940
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,330
The deal-makers
are here in Berlin.

941
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,369
They want Chuck
to come to Berlin.

942
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,649
They say it isn't fucking
necessary for us to go to Berlin.

943
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,002
Dan, we're the fucking fluffer.

944
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,004
Wrong.
Not with our numbers.

945
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,286
They just blew us off!

946
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,601
They haven't seen
our numbers, yet.

947
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,926
I've been working
on this deal for a year.

948
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,161
I'm not the fucking fluffer.

949
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,685
This is not my
first business trip!

950
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,200
We're broke, Dan.

951
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,441
What are you talking about?

952
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,527
It's worse than you think.

953
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,968
Two companies that owed us...

954
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,804
they went bankrupt.

955
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,691
We didn't have
any income in June, July.

956
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,571
I should have told you, but I
thought this deal was gonna work.

957
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,169
We're gonna get this deal.
I told you, God damn it.

958
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,801
We're good business for them.

959
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,441
I'm gonna make sure
they understand that.

960
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,242
Well, I've done some weird
stuff on this trip.

961
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,724
I ordered a sex maid, which you
should reimburse me for...

962
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,924
because you got all the
good stuff from that.

963
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,765
But I like you, Dan.

964
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,484
And I'm sorry
I raised my voice...

965
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,560
but I really need the
benefits of this deal now.

966
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,886
My marriage is a mess.

967
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,682
I just...

968
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,921
I just want a future
that has some joy in it.

969
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,049
<i>Like Fifty Shades of Grey.</i>

970
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,561
Or, fuck it, I'd settle
for one shade of grey.

971
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,609
Listen, you work for me now.

972
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,081
I'm gonna make sure
that your hard work counts.

973
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,603
We are gonna get this one, Tim.

974
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,081
I'm ready for it.
Good.

975
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,520
Okay.

976
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,281
Tim?

977
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,807
Tim?

978
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,282
There's no reimbursement
for the maid.

979
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,601
Can you please
initial here?

980
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,046
To say you acknowledge
that you are

981
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,248
staying in
a habitable work of art.

982
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,361
Great.

983
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,448
I'll enjoy it. It's been
a long couple days.

984
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,170
You're too old
to sleep in a room.

985
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,085
Okay. Uh...

986
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,960
Where can I sleep?

987
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,650
You can sleep in the stairwell,

988
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,081
in the hallway,
or in the Business Centre.

989
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,164
Okay.
The Business Centre.

990
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,123
Hey, it's Dad.

991
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,961
<i>So, I've been
trying to reach you.</i>

992
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,446
Where are you?

993
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,921
Berlin. I'm still
on business. Hey, Paul...

994
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,368
I don't like the way that you're
talking about yourself at all.

995
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,002
And that sounds like...

996
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,328
something you heard
someone else say about you.

997
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,962
<i>That's not something that you
should call yourself, ever.</i>

998
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,527
<i>You know, I say it
all the time, but...</i>

999
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,284
<i>I'm your biggest confidant.</i>

1000
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,365
<i>You can tell me stuff that
no one else needs to know.</i>

1001
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,204
<i>I think you're being teased,</i>

1002
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,169
<i>and I want you to know
you're not alone.</i>

1003
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,850
Who are those people?

1004
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,927
<i>What people?</i>

1005
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,001
Behind you.

1006
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,481
What is this shit?

1007
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,328
What the fuck
are you do... Hello?

1008
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,646
This is creepy.

1009
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,404
I'm trying to
have a call, here.

1010
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,164
What the fuck is this shit?

1011
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,883
Can I have curtains?
No.

1012
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,168
Well, I'd really like them.
Curtains.

1013
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,520
You don't have a private room.

1014
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,890
You have an installation room.

1015
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,720
Can I have another room?
No.

1016
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,642
We are a museum, not a hotel.

1017
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,564
Can you call another hotel? No.

1018
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,644
It's October, in Berlin.
There are no other rooms.

1019
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,970
Don't worry about curtains.

1020
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,401
You are art.

1021
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,166
I'm not!
I'm here on business.

1022
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,651
I just wanna tweak
my PowerPoints

1023
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,880
and do my stomach crunches...

1024
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,081
and sleep.

1025
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,161
It's not art.

1026
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,410
Well, who can say?

1027
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,324
I can. It's my life.

1028
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,481
Don't look.

1029
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,723
It's up to them to choose
what they look at.

1030
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,003
Just be yourself.

1031
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,208
Okay. I'll be myself.

1032
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,927
But I'm gonna Yelp you guys.

1033
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,128
Probably not gonna be good.

1034
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,481
<i>Try to tell you
all about it</i>

1035
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,040
<i>Thought you might've,
Lord, I doubt it</i>

1036
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,765
<i>Every day's a waste, I know
And every day's a funeral</i>

1037
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,691
<i>And it's days like this
that burn me</i>

1038
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,764
<i>Turn me inside out and learn me</i>

1039
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,167
<i>Not to tell you anything</i>

1040
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,730
<i>I think I know</i>

1041
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,650
<i>Well, I think I'll tell
you all that I know</i>

1042
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,961
We don't have one summer
vacation in our colleges.

1043
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,566
We have many.

1044
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,441
A few.
Three is "a few"?

1045
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,564
Yeah. Three is a few.
That's right.

1046
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:02,889
<i>At the bottom
of the big blue sea</i>

1047
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,131
Uh...

1048
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,411
Does that feel good?

1049
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,891
For you?

1050
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,121
No.

1051
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,322
Maybe we should just
try to do it normal.

1052
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:17,280
Because I have no idea
how to do a wheelbarrow.

1053
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,410
And my balls hurt a little.

1054
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,481
So, maybe put me down
when you get a chance.

1055
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,926
Yeah, okay. Sorry.

1056
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,164
Okay. Okay.

1057
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,248
<i>And it's days like this
that burn me</i>

1058
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,891
<i>Turn me inside out and learn me</i>

1059
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,247
<i>And it's days like this
that burn me</i>

1060
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,685
<i>Turn me inside out and learn me</i>

1061
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,561
<i>And not to tell you anything</i>

1062
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,485
<i>I think I know</i>

1063
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,447
I'm looking right at monthly
expenses, and the planned expenses...

1064
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,602
Thank you.

1065
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,003
<i>Businessman 42!
Can I get a picture?</i>

1066
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,569
42!

1067
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,966
So, today
we have this down day.

1068
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,122
Or, as we call it, a push day.

1069
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,124
These are the days that
you really have to focus.

1070
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,361
A down day, man.

1071
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,329
There's no dogs to walk...

1072
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,369
no kids to school.

1073
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,000
So, you can't start
drinking at 10 a.m.

1074
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,286
on a day like this.

1075
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,561
But you wanna
own your down day.

1076
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,643
You do not want
your down day to own you.

1077
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,370
Stay fresh.

1078
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,403
Check in with the family.

1079
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,050
So, I'm gonna go for a run.

1080
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,006
Finish my daughter's little
fucking homework assignment...

1081
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,128
which is driving me crazy.

1082
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,881
I'm sorry.

1083
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,526
"No curtains," that's
what they said to me.

1084
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,411
So, I'm being
no curtains with you.

1085
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,484
<i>Your daddy is...</i>

1086
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,929
<i>Your daddy, honey, is a man who
is concerned about you now...</i>

1087
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,004
<i>in addition to your brother.</i>

1088
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,686
<i>Because you beat the shit
out of a small Indian kid.</i>

1089
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,120
<i>Maybe you're acting out because</i>

1090
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,168
<i>Daddy hasn't been
home a lot this year.</i>

1091
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,163
<i>But don't turn
into a mean kid...</i>

1092
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,401
<i>or grow sad,</i>

1093
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,084
<i>like I think your brother has.</i>

1094
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,084
<i>I don't want him to turn
into some unhappy behemoth.</i>

1095
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,686
<i>And it's my job to teach
him the coping skills...</i>

1096
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,446
<i>that can help him handle
that shit he's dealing with.</i>

1097
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,161
<i>But I'm here in Kugelfargen fucking
Park instead, wasting time...</i>

1098
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,681
<i>wondering if we're the
fluffer company on this one.</i>

1099
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,001
<i>Don't Google that.</i>

1100
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,770
<i>But I think I'm almost home.</i>

1101
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,888
<i>We can close this deal if
we can just get in the room</i>

1102
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,769
<i>before Chuck closes it first.</i>

1103
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,331
<i>I called
motherfucking little round</i>

1104
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,686
<i>English motherfucker Whilmsley.</i>

1105
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,763
<i>But he's not returning
Daddy's calls.</i>

1106
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,689
No more down day.

1107
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,763
Were you here earlier
when I was explaining that?

1108
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,200
No.

1109
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,361
It used to be a down day,

1110
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,441
but now it's
a "find Bill Whilmsley" day.

1111
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,807
I left two messages at his
office, but he's not in.

1112
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,564
Yeah, I saw that part.

1113
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,125
It was boring.

1114
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,089
I'm sorry, man,
but I have to find him.

1115
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,720
I have to have him see
our hard numbers today...

1116
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,370
and tell us that
we're not better.

1117
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,562
Chuck is closing,
it feels like that.

1118
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,601
This motherfucker Whilmsley
will not respond.

1119
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,922
I built this deal
with him for a year.

1120
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,560
Look, I put Whilmsley's
name in instagram...

1121
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,087
and we can find him,
maybe, through the pics.

1122
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,443
And then, we could fake bump
into him and be like...

1123
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:07,241
"Hey, Bill, what a coincidence.
It's Mike Pancake."

1124
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,691
Like that.
Good idea.

1125
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,445
Don't say the last part. Tell
me if he posts something.

1126
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,171
Mr. McWinters? Hey.

1127
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,004
It's me, Kelf.
From the hostel.

1128
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,321
Oh, hi!

1129
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,641
Hi, how are you?

1130
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,520
I got your ecstasy, right here.

1131
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,281
Oh, thank you.

1132
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,480
Enjoy it.
Have a nice trip.

1133
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,121
They said, "Take one of
these, and go dancing."

1134
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,601
And, "it doesn't change
you, it reveals you."

1135
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,330
And I like that.

1136
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,685
He posted. Look, Bill posted.
Check it out.

1137
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,205
Where is he?

1138
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,521
He's with dudes.

1139
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,009
He's encircled by men.

1140
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,406
Whoa.

1141
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,801
This guy went really
gay on his down day.

1142
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,411
"Pampelmuse."

1143
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,483
It looks like
he's in the middle

1144
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,483
of that Folsom Festival.

1145
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,767
<i>Bill Whilmsley?
Do you have a PA system?</i>

1146
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,685
Is it possible to say his name,
so everyone can hear it?

1147
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,604
Bill Whilmsley?
Bill Whilmsley?

1148
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,961
We're not detectives, we're
just looking for our friend.

1149
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,844
Bill Whilmsley. He looks
like kind of a grizzly bear.

1150
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,650
This is my first time
at a gay bar.

1151
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,801
No way. Yeah?
Yeah.

1152
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,405
Are you not gay?
No.

1153
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,562
But you guys
are having so much fun.

1154
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,964
MAN 13 Hello?

1155
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,521
Fuck.

1156
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,330
Hello?

1157
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,246
I don't speak German. Shit.

1158
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,802
I was just asking,
still raining?

1159
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,762
No, stopped, uh...

1160
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:51,085
I don't know, 40 minutes ago.
It was good seeing you.

1161
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,129
Hold on.
Where's the fire?

1162
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,601
I know where I am
and I know what this is...

1163
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,524
but I didn't know
when I came in here.

1164
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,045
I came in here
looking for someone.

1165
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,521
I didn't come in here looking
for, you know, dicks.

1166
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,762
Maybe I can convince
you to stay for a little bit?

1167
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,127
No, I was just...

1168
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,201
Hi, by the way.

1169
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,482
Again, I did not come in
here to be with you guys.

1170
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,404
I was looking for someone
who was in the bar earlier.

1171
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,130
Why don't you just
green eggs and ham?

1172
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,281
What?

1173
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,044
"You don't like them,
so you say",

1174
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,282
"'Try them. And you may."

1175
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,885
Yeah, I liked
that book as a kid.

1176
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,361
I don't remember the "sucking guys'
dicks through a wall" part...

1177
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,441
but good book.

1178
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,010
My name
is Ambrose, by the way.

1179
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,121
I'm Nils.

1180
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,486
Whoa.

1181
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,682
Hey, Mike?
This is Ambrose and Nils.

1182
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,207
What's up?
Put her there.

1183
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,600
It's nice to meet you.

1184
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,841
Whoa!

1185
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,482
Houston, we have contact.

1186
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,168
It got hard
in my hand a little.

1187
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,281
Okay, I was just
kidding, but thanks!

1188
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,449
So, this guy
you are looking for...

1189
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,523
English accent. He was
here 40 minutes ago.

1190
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,322
God! Fuck!

1191
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,245
I am so sorry.
Did I startle you?

1192
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,448
You kind of poked me
in my ass with your dick.

1193
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,000
So, yeah,
little startled there, bud.

1194
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,168
Sorry. My bad.

1195
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,607
It has an eye, but it cannot see.

1196
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,201
Bill?

1197
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,686
Bill Whilmsley?

1198
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,761
Do I know you?

1199
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,447
Dan Trunkman, Apex Select.

1200
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:11,687
Hey, Dan!

1201
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,441
What's up?
Not much.

1202
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,450
Just got our numbers where we want
them, thought we'd grab a beer.

1203
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,284
Just wandered in.

1204
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,050
Hey, Bill?
Yeah?

1205
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,725
I don't wanna
cock-block anybody,

1206
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,290
but love to show
you those numbers.

1207
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,610
As you can imagine,
it's not really...

1208
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,729
what I had
planned for tonight.

1209
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,921
What is your margin number?

1210
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:30,961
17%.

1211
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,081
Well, yes.

1212
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,969
You certainly have
my attention now.

1213
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,650
And you have my
attention as well.

1214
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,051
All right. Will you just give
me a second to sort myself out?

1215
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,167
And I will meet you out back.

1216
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,321
Great.

1217
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,205
Thanks, Bill.
You got a real big one.

1218
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,569
Oh, well, thank you.

1219
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,090
<i>Bye, Ambrose.
Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

1220
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,202
Enjoy your stay
in Berlin.

1221
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,681
I didn't get a chance
to meet you.

1222
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,810
Whoa, hey!

1223
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,922
The penis touched my face.

1224
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,570
Wow.

1225
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,561
These are sweet.

1226
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,410
Maarten Daaervk
is a top-sheet guy.

1227
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,845
He is gonna love these numbers.

1228
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,041
Who is that?

1229
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,531
He owns us.

1230
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,125
He owns Geiger, all of it.

1231
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,406
He's in town for the G8.

1232
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,324
Hey, American Businessman 42!

1233
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,641
Hey, guys!

1234
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,087
I'm going viral here a little bit.
I'll explain it later.

1235
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,766
So, where does this leave us?

1236
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:36,720
This leaves you
kicking Chuck's arse.

1237
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,847
So, we gonna get it?

1238
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,490
Let's fucking celebrate, Apex!

1239
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,851
To APEX!
Apex!

1240
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,411
I'm gonna get that divorce!

1241
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:54,841
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

1242
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,571
This is our second night
at the youth hostel.

1243
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,926
<i>Flugelschlagen!</i>

1244
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,126
This from Korea!

1245
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,284
This one from Russia.

1246
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,769
This is from America.

1247
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,127
"Let's get fucked up!"

1248
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,609
<i>Out to! The sun up</i>

1249
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,484
<i>Twisted and burn up</i>

1250
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,449
<i>Can't nobody stop us?</i>

1251
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,125
<i>We gone delirious</i>

1252
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,804
Come on in!

1253
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,970
<i>Twisted and burn up</i>

1254
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,008
<i>Can't nobody stop us?</i>

1255
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,725
<i>We gone delirious</i>

1256
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,131
La-Ia-Ia-Ia-Ia-Ia

1257
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,201
Come on!

1258
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,325
<i>Come and take a ride</i>

1259
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,488
<i>Stay up all night, okay</i>

1260
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,761
You go.

1261
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,441
That is Tequila Slaps.

1262
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,886
It's fun, right?

1263
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,644
Come on in!

1264
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,605
Come on in, keep going.

1265
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:09,841
Oh!

1266
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,608
I didn't mean to go that hard.

1267
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,523
You're smiling,
but your eyes are mean.

1268
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,566
Oh!

1269
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,610
That's enough, I think.

1270
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,889
Every time!
You're the best!

1271
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,041
Pull!

1272
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,530
What happened?

1273
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,440
Just throw it! The waiting
is the worst part.

1274
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,762
Apex Select!

1275
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,721
<i>Flugelschlagen!</i>

1276
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,251
<i>Oh, no thick walls</i>

1277
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,331
<i>Are gonna block the waves</i>

1278
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,890
<i>No, not quite space enough</i>

1279
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,883
<i>Between that'd ever
kill the bass</i>

1280
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,446
<i>Ooh, ah</i>

1281
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,682
<i>That shaking,
rattling, cracking</i>

1282
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,410
<i>You can't take it
'cause you know</i>

1283
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,801
<i>It rubs you wrong</i>

1284
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,046
<i>But does it rub you wrong?</i>

1285
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,730
<i>Ooh, you can fight it
if you want</i>

1286
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,290
<i>If you want</i>

1287
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,450
<i>Ooh, you can fight it
if you want</i>

1288
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,280
Oh, man!

1289
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,446
Thanks so much for looking at
our numbers tonight, Bill.

1290
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,171
Listen, I want you to know...

1291
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,966
that it's not my scene,
glory-holing.

1292
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,370
But...

1293
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,490
it's the only scenario
where I can get any anymore.

1294
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:02,890
I am a pear-shaped,
middle-aged man, Dan.

1295
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,566
I've really let
myself go to pot.

1296
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,563
And it's work!

1297
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,688
You just pack it on.

1298
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,047
I started training
to run a marathon

1299
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,963
to stay on top of it.

1300
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,690
And I told...

1301
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,251
Do you wanna hear this?
Yes.

1302
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,686
Do you wanna hear it?
Yes.

1303
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,808
I told my whole family...

1304
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,089
"I'm running the St. Louis
Marathon this year!"

1305
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:28,643
And I got up to 15 miles
straight in July.

1306
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,804
But, man,
with all the travelling

1307
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,729
you and I did for this deal...

1308
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,321
I started not doing it anymore.

1309
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,001
At all.

1310
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:42,006
And that is the problem.

1311
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,891
You take your eye off the ball,

1312
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,042
even just for a week...

1313
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,406
the next thing you know,

1314
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,330
you are sticking
your cock through a wall.

1315
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,569
I used to run.
I used to play rugby.

1316
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,724
I used to be all
kinds of ripped.

1317
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,049
I've been to Folsom
the last two nights,

1318
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,288
and it's like I'm a ghost.

1319
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,044
No one sees me.

1320
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,965
I didn't even get
as much as a kiss.

1321
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:11,761
Not one kiss.

1322
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,531
That's their loss.
It is their loss.

1323
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,809
I'm so unhappy at work.

1324
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,450
It's like I'm not heard.

1325
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,407
You got a pretty big dick.
That's something.

1326
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,442
Yeah. I can't
even suck that anymore.

1327
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,405
These are the presentation...

1328
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,803
If a loose swarf goes around in
an apex, then what happens in a...

1329
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,085
Hey, Chuck.

1330
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,571
How you doing?

1331
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,400
Are you seriously
staying here, Dan?

1332
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,241
You know, I'm glad
that you're here...

1333
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,323
because it gives me
the chance to tell you...

1334
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:08,165
that we are coming in
strong this morning.

1335
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,084
So, nothing personal...

1336
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,010
but we crushed you.

1337
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,287
When I compete
against someone like you...

1338
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,966
like now...

1339
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:20,841
I often invent dehumanizing
nicknames for them...

1340
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,764
in my mind.

1341
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,204
You're "The Flower Girl."

1342
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,290
I'm not gonna ask you why,

1343
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,124
because that's what
you want me to do.

1344
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,841
You're "The Flower Girl"
because you're at the party.

1345
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,486
You're dressed up.

1346
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,608
Everyone's glad
that you're there.

1347
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,364
You do your little thing,
then you sit down,

1348
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,885
and you let
the grownups get to it.

1349
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,804
Flower girl.

1350
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,450
You're a bizarre woman.

1351
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,365
If the three of us
could shake hands,

1352
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,124
you, me and Benjaminson,
I would.

1353
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,891
I would.

1354
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,042
But we can't.

1355
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,567
Because people don't
shake hands that way.

1356
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,121
So, good luck.

1357
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,165
We don't need it.

1358
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,328
We're prepared.
We're Apex.

1359
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:10,961
Fuck me.

1360
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,731
Are you just allowed
to come into my room?

1361
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,325
There's an issue.
I'm sorry.

1362
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,882
We tried to process your
credit card for today's stay.

1363
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,691
I'm afraid it's not working.

1364
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,848
You can't throw me out.
I'm art.

1365
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,162
You leaving
will be art as well.

1366
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,250
So, quick, quick.

1367
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,041
What are you doing?

1368
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,890
Oh, you're gonna get it!

1369
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,526
Makes me a little uncomfortable

1370
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:55,840
how much you want it, but...

1371
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,364
You're intense!

1372
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,281
Shit.

1373
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,769
6 minutes.

1374
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,126
I gotta go. I gotta go!

1375
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,360
<i>I saw, I came, I
conquered Or should I say</i>

1376
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,410
You're good at this.
Have you done this before?

1377
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,241
Coming through!

1378
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,850
<i>Now big bang boogie Get
that kitty little noogie</i>

1379
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,649
<i>In a nice, nice little shade</i>

1380
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:21,721
<i>I gave Suzie a little
pat up on the booty</i>

1381
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,411
<i>Walk this way</i>

1382
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,290
You told him to meet us here?
Yeah.

1383
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,647
Last night, right?
Yeah.

1384
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:34,927
Where the fuck is he?

1385
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:39,483
Maybe he's already there.
I mean, he's a go-getter.

1386
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,563
I'm serious. I'm concerned for him.
You should be, too.

1387
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,006
I am.

1388
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:47,931
What the fuck is that?

1389
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,571
<i>Fireball</i>

1390
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:56,966
Let's do this thing.

1391
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,128
Mike, the next time you
wanna run around Berlin...

1392
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:03,602
playing grab-ass with a Japanese
businessman in a hamster ball...

1393
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,240
you gotta let either me or
your older companion know.

1394
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,841
How are you?
I'm good. How are you?

1395
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,287
Good, Jim. We are excited
to be here at Geiger...

1396
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,967
to present a long-term purchase
and a lend-share cost-buy.

1397
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:27,282
We are ready to meet
your high expectations.

1398
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,886
Terrific. Why don't
you all have a seat?

1399
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:31,280
And we'll get started.

1400
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:36,647
Aren't we gonna pitch Geiger
today, your parent department?

1401
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,609
Austerlitz was
gonna sit in, possibly,

1402
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,205
but he's not gonna be
able to make it today.

1403
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:42,681
I thought Dirk Austerlitz
was our principal.

1404
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,487
I thought that we flew here
to see Dirk Austerlitz, Jim.

1405
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,201
Dirk and I are working
on this together.

1406
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,129
Dirk had to fly to
St. Louis today, so...

1407
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:52,483
Do you, Jim, know...

1408
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,722
that we all live
in St. Louis?

1409
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,491
Oh, wow.
Yeah.

1410
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,166
We left there to fly here
to see the guy

1411
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,481
that is in St. Louis, Jim.

1412
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,687
No shit?

1413
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,651
That's no good.

1414
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,730
Well, let's get started.

1415
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,487
Where's Bill?

1416
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,690
We covered a lot of this
ground last night with Bill.

1417
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,685
We pretty much shook on it.

1418
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,365
You can shake hands
with Bill all day long...

1419
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,244
but he doesn't
make our decisions.

1420
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,366
Where is Bill?

1421
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,205
Bill's getting my lunch.

1422
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,841
You wanna get started?

1423
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,401
Okay.

1424
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:42,521
Let me gear up my media, and I'll
walk you through our aftermarket.

1425
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,964
Great.

1426
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,887
So, what was
your meeting about?

1427
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,361
Wholesale swarf residue
bargain cost-buys.

1428
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,443
"Swarf," is that a real thing?
Yeah, it's a real thing.

1429
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:58,926
What do you think,
we're like Dr. Seuss?

1430
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,367
We're just making up something,
like shit out of thin air?

1431
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,721
No. It's real.

1432
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,609
But it's just not interesting.

1433
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,091
Well, why do you do it?

1434
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,091
Well...

1435
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,404
I'm gonna send my
son to private school.

1436
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,324
Maybe it's worth it,
I'm thinking.

1437
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,130
If there's one less kid
in the class...

1438
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,721
then maybe there's one less kid

1439
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,962
to make fun of him
24 hours a day.

1440
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,722
Teasing sucks.
Yeah.

1441
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,723
Have any of you
guys been teased?

1442
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,451
Yeah. I've been teased.

1443
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,568
I lived in America for a year.

1444
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:34,564
In Connecticut, and they
made fun of my name.

1445
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,000
What's your name?

1446
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,241
Karen.

1447
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,200
Yeah, well, in Sweden
it's like "John,"

1448
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,083
but in Connecticut,
it's like...

1449
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:44,810
"Stacy."
Yeah, I can see that.

1450
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,167
You know the worst
part with teasing?

1451
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,527
My dad would say,

1452
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:53,251
"Just forget about it
and ignore it, son."

1453
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,125
But he doesn't understand
because in his day...

1454
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,562
kids would get teased
at school all day,

1455
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,290
but then they could go home.

1456
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,408
And nowadays, you come home,

1457
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,801
and there's Facebook
and instagram...

1458
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,328
and the bullies can get at you
through all of that stuff.

1459
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,642
And it never really stops.

1460
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,286
It never stops.

1461
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,807
When I was a kid, people
could only ridicule me...

1462
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,725
every day until
3:10 in the afternoon.

1463
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,564
Okay, Snoop Lion,

1464
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:28,291
I think it's probably
time to pass that now.

1465
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,482
Oh, me? Yes.

1466
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,126
Go ahead, Karen.

1467
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,884
Pardon me.

1468
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,404
<i>Hello?
Dan, it's Jim.</i>

1469
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,085
Hey, Jim!

1470
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,890
<i>Okay, Dan,
your numbers are good...</i>

1471
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,644
<i>but, the thing</i> is...

1472
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,923
<i>numbers are just part of what
we have to take into account.</i>

1473
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,045
<i>Are you wearing
eye shadow?</i>

1474
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,683
<i>Yeah, I just
wanted to show Paul</i>

1475
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,524
<i>that I understand how he feels.</i>

1476
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,886
You're cool, Dan.

1477
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:39,686
How are you doing?

1478
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,882
<i>Your bra's on
outside your shirt.</i>

1479
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,280
<i>Did you know that?</i>

1480
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,761
Yes. I do know that.

1481
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,083
I was having a boob
conversation with Bess...

1482
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,881
<i>and she was worried that her
boobs were gonna come out.</i>

1483
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,486
<i>So I showed her how to
trap them with a bra.</i>

1484
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,402
<i>I just realized I went to
Coffee Bean like this.</i>

1485
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:03,483
I'm sure you made an impression.
Can I talk to her?

1486
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,641
<i>Bess!</i>

1487
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,201
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

1488
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,044
Did you finish my homework?

1489
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,090
I have not yet, no.

1490
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,526
Honey, uh,

1491
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,728
why did you beat
the shit out of another kid?

1492
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,528
They were making fun of Paul.

1493
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,082
They were calling
Paul fat names.

1494
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,125
<i>"Double Stuf."</i>

1495
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:26,083
<i>The fat Oreos.</i>

1496
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,446
Good job...

1497
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,445
my little can
of whoop-ass.

1498
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,802
I should probably
add to that...

1499
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,889
that I'll take care of Paul.

1500
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,610
That's my job.

1501
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:40,048
You be a kid.
That's your job. Okay?

1502
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:42,607
Can I talk to him?

1503
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,728
<i>Sure. Paul?</i>

1504
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,281
Hey-

1505
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:47,727
Hey-

1506
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:49,721
<i>Are you wearing eye shadow?</i>

1507
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,769
Yeah. "Straight-Up Teal."

1508
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,763
<i>Why?</i> That's the one
that you picked.

1509
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:57,009
Yeah, when they bagged on me.

1510
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,965
<i>Goth dicks!</i>

1511
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,168
Goth is lame.
Goth isn't outlaw.

1512
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,129
I mean, this is the
look right here, man.

1513
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,964
<i>Any guy can wear dark.</i>

1514
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,565
<i>But rocking teal...</i>

1515
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,485
<i>See, teal is very outlaw.</i>

1516
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,321
It's like, the goth kids,
really...

1517
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,244
they're joiners,
when you think about it.

1518
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,243
The teal kids,
they really stand alone.

1519
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:18,011
And whenever I have
to pick a color,

1520
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,481
obviously,
I pick teal every time.

1521
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:21,766
For sure.

1522
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,968
Because, you know...

1523
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:25,851
no one else does it.

1524
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,970
And because you
have to be bold.

1525
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,844
Because you have
to be teal tough.

1526
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,324
Give me a break, Dad.
Come on!

1527
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,528
<i>We could probably
start a gang, me and you.</i>

1528
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:36,806
<i>Just for real men, though.</i>

1529
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,480
Yeah, I guess we could.

1530
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,846
Like "The Teal Boys."

1531
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,400
How many kids
are in your class?

1532
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,326
42.

1533
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:46,811
And how many of those
kids pick on you?

1534
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:47,961
41.

1535
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:51,441
<i>Hey, I gotta go.</i>

1536
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,640
Just listen for one second.
Stay here.

1537
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,440
Stay here and just
listen to me for a second.

1538
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:58,850
Now, Paul, you're gonna
switch schools.

1539
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,005
But that's not really gonna
change anything much, honestly.

1540
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,969
You're just gonna
have to stay tough.

1541
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,329
I know that you are feeling like
that you're sticking out...

1542
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,321
and that you're going
through a lot of stuff...

1543
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:14,047
<i>but we're gonna
get through this.</i>

1544
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:16,481
<i>Me and you. Teal tough.</i>

1545
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,086
When are you coming home?

1546
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:20,881
Tomorrow.

1547
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:22,921
Did you get the handshake?

1548
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:28,364
Dad froze again!

1549
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,883
I heard from Jim Spinch.

1550
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,401
<i>Your daddy
just counted up</i>

1551
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,403
<i>who he's responsible for.</i>

1552
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,722
<i>One boy. One girl.</i>

1553
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:57,531
<i>One woman. One old guy.</i>

1554
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,682
<i>One kind of,</i> uh...

1555
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,490
<i>How do you describe Mike?</i>

1556
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:04,246
<i>Good. Sweet.</i>

1557
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,050
<i>And I let him down.</i>

1558
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,931
<i>I'm going to have to
let him go next week.</i>

1559
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:10,206
<i>Timothy, too.</i>

1560
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:15,090
<i>Your daddy's a man who
didn't get the handshake.</i>

1561
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,766
American Businessman 42!

1562
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,924
<i>He's the fluffer,
seems like.</i>

1563
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,924
<i>He's also someone that will try
and forget this feeling...</i>

1564
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,044
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

1565
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,966
Hey, um, sorry.

1566
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,884
I don't mean to bother you...

1567
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,804
but you're so pretty.

1568
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,928
Kind of like a painting.

1569
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,124
I'm sorry.

1570
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:05,286
It's so obvious now.

1571
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,130
<i>Flugelschlagen.</i>

1572
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,322
<i>Sometimes,
when troubles come</i>

1573
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,641
<i>all of a sudden too much...</i>

1574
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,484
<i>when we FaceTime...</i>

1575
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:40,843
<i>Dad freezes and pretends
Face Time's broken.</i>

1576
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,970
<i>So he doesn't have to deal
with things right then.</i>

1577
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,490
<i>I'm not gonna freeze today.</i>

1578
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:17,285
<i>Sometimes in life,
you have to take inventory.</i>

1579
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,448
<i>This is one of those times.</i>

1580
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:23,122
<i>Not landing where you thought
you would, hoped to...</i>

1581
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:26,170
<i>and asking the questions, "What
could I have done differently?"</i>

1582
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,560
<i>"Could I have led better?"</i>

1583
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,521
<i>The only thing you can do
when things go against you...</i>

1584
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:33,160
<i>is pick yourself up
and push back.</i>

1585
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,121
Hey.

1586
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,766
Hey, sir!
Come out of the race!

1587
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,441
<i>My hopes for this trip,
for this handshake...</i>

1588
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,967
<i>for it to be the end of a
pretty good losing streak.</i>

1589
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,929
American Businessman 42!

1590
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,242
This is American
Businessman 42, everyone!

1591
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,845
Go, go!
You can do it!

1592
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,490
I don't believe it! Run!

1593
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,524
<i>I'm not going
to freeze today.</i>

1594
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,808
<i>I've chased this thing
all the way to Germany.</i>

1595
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,883
<i>I'm going to find the man
behind the</i> man...

1596
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,804
<i>even though we
might get humiliated.</i>

1597
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,041
<i>But we're ready.</i>

1598
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,611
<i>The old guy's
got life left.</i> ..

1599
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,364
<i>And the young guy's
an animal now.</i>

1600
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,851
<i>So I'm telling the boys...</i>

1601
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,367
<i>"Suits back on,
get on the starship,"</i>

1602
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,681
<i>"and let's go get
this goddamn handshake."</i>

1603
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,604
Hello? Dan?

1604
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,205
Yeah. You at the Aldon
with Daaervk?

1605
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,441
<i>Yes.</i>

1606
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,125
We'll be there in 10 minutes.

1607
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,123
<i>Awful. Why?</i>

1608
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,486
Get me in to see him.

1609
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:45,127
<i>I'm gonna see him for
3 minutes, just for a team photo.</i>

1610
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:46,645
I want to show him my sheet.

1611
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,121
<i>It's impossible!
I cannot go around Jim.</i>

1612
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,361
We're coming.

1613
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,800
You got a big dick, Bill.

1614
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,200
Act like it.

1615
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,164
<i>Dan? It's madness!</i>

1616
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,688
How the hell are we
gonna get over there?

1617
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:42,287
How you doing?

1618
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,523
I'm here for a meeting.
They're expecting me.

1619
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,682
I understand, sir.

1620
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,205
Clearly, I'm not rioting.

1621
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:50,010
Whoa! Easy, buddy!

1622
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:51,764
We're just three guys
on business!

1623
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,365
Hey! Get your fucking
hands off of me!

1624
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:56,481
Leave him alone!

1625
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:57,721
Calm down, Tim!

1626
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,046
Son of a bitch!

1627
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,007
Dan!

1628
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,771
They are very important people.

1629
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:19,081
I need them in with me right now.
Right now!

1630
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,281
Are you okay, Dan?

1631
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:24,728
I'm not crying. That's
just poison in my eyes.

1632
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,769
Let's go. Get your
top sheet, all right?

1633
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:29,048
2 seconds.
Just one of you.

1634
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:30,406
Mike, go.

1635
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:32,606
I'm just kidding.

1636
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:34,926
I got it.

1637
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:36,926
Jim is gonna kill me.

1638
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,081
We're better, Bill.

1639
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,924
He'll throw a coffee
in my face.

1640
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,241
We're better.

1641
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,041
Just wait here a sec.

1642
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:58,929
Mr. Daaervk.

1643
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:01,209
This is Dan Trunkman.

1644
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:02,526
And this is Apex Select's

1645
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,284
long-purchase
cost share sheet.

1646
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:16,761
Sit down.

1647
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,840
Are you okay?

1648
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,128
Yeah. I just got
tear-gassed.

1649
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,611
A whole canister.

1650
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:36,163
I got caught in the crowd
and in the horses.

1651
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,084
I just got shot, all over.

1652
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:41,926
I'm just explaining
why I look so effed-up.

1653
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,651
"Effed up"?

1654
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,485
Um...

1655
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:47,681
"Fucked."

1656
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:51,209
Oh, "fucked."
Yes, you do.

1657
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:56,649
Can I see your
dollar exchange ratio?

1658
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,889
We feel very strong
about our numbers.

1659
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,168
It is fudged a little, hmm?

1660
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,004
You converted it twice.

1661
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:13,161
It is.

1662
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:15,209
It's fudged a little, yeah.

1663
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,681
"Keeblered," as we say.

1664
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,164
You know that?
Yeah, we know that.

1665
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:21,281
It's an old trick.

1666
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:22,526
The guy's old who...

1667
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:23,966
Fire him.

1668
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:27,646
Uh...

1669
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,047
No.

1670
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,890
He worked extremely hard
on this sheet.

1671
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:35,684
I stand by what he did.

1672
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,202
I'm just kidding.

1673
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:41,361
Jeez.

1674
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,925
We think we would be
a complement to you...

1675
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:49,687
not only on this job,
but in the future.

1676
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,922
And being able to
look ahead to the things...

1677
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,686
that are gonna be
in front of you.

1678
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,161
So, how many people
do you employ?

1679
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:00,370
Two. Three of us,
altogether.

1680
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,721
How many do you?

1681
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:03,401
Oh...

1682
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,489
200,000-something.

1683
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,324
Fuck.

1684
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:09,846
Yeah.

1685
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,402
But three is tough, too.

1686
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:15,890
In a different way.

1687
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,162
I started with four.

1688
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,729
Like a family, when you
know everyone's name.

1689
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,841
But that can wear on you, too.

1690
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,407
Uh...

1691
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,401
So, this is slightly better.

1692
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:31,686
Bottom line.

1693
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:34,368
So, okay. Yeah.

1694
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:38,201
Are you going to shake my hand?

1695
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,520
I have some other shit to do.

1696
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:43,045
Yeah.

1697
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,090
Yes.
Okay.

1698
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,444
Who's your daddy, baby?

1699
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,967
Who's your fucking daddy?

1700
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:07,041
We got it.

1701
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:15,885
Oh, my goodness.

1702
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,088
Did something just happen? Did
we just come from a meeting?

1703
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,288
Did things just get
exciting around here?

1704
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:22,721
Oh, yeah, here it comes.

1705
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:23,881
Boom.

1706
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,804
There it is.
Very nice.

1707
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,041
I got you!

1708
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:33,402
I know it's been
a long trip, but rest up.

1709
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:34,811
Monday, we're back at it.

1710
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:37,891
Hey! I'm divorced.

1711
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,286
Just like that?

1712
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:40,601
There's an app.

1713
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:43,807
Hey, Jim!

1714
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,120
Did you have to fly to St.
Louis to talk to your boss?

1715
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,730
Yeah, that's right.

1716
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,251
Hey, Dan,
can I get your address?

1717
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,321
Sure.

1718
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,323
Because usually when someone fucks
me, I like to send them flowers.

1719
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,164
I like carnations.

1720
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,288
And if you make out a card,
include all three of us...

1721
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:57,646
because it was a three-way.

1722
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,484
You were my third fuck!

1723
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:03,125
Mike!

1724
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:04,801
Guys!

1725
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,010
Oh, man!
Oh, you guys!

1726
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:11,130
I missed you!
I missed you!

1727
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:14,005
Oh, wait. Guys, these
are my roommates.

1728
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:18,363
Tobey and Sebastian and Tobey.

1729
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:21,649
Sebastian, Tobeys,
I don't have to tell you...

1730
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,450
you've got
one hell of a friend here.

1731
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,364
And it is emperlaten

1732
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,363
that you ask Mike
about his trip.

1733
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,364
Because this cat had some
pretty major explers.

1734
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:35,124
Yeah. I lost
my virginity! Twice!

1735
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,050
Good stuff, Pancake.

1736
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:41,043
See you Monday, pal.
Yeah.

1737
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,281
See you Monday, Mike.

1738
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:43,646
BYE, guys.

1739
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,122
How are you
getting home?

1740
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:50,409
I'm leaving with a friend.

1741
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,043
Is that the, uh,
actual maid from...?

1742
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,248
We kept in touch.

1743
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,846
Why is she wearing
her maid outfit?

1744
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,162
I asked her nicely, Dan.

1745
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:03,560
Silver fox.

1746
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,403
Boom! I like that.

1747
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:08,521
You remember Dan?

1748
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:09,641
Hello.
Hi. Pleasure.

1749
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:10,926
Nice to meet you.

1750
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,082
We should go.
Okay.

1751
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:14,241
Great.

1752
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,407
Thanks.

1753
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,731
Thank you, Tim.

1754
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:22,120
Why are you standing here?

1755
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,760
Don't you have a wheelbarrow you're
supposed to be jumping into?

1756
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:35,447
Daddy!
Hey!

1757
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:36,931
Ohh

1758
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,201
Come on!

1759
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,249
How are you, sweetheart?
I'm good.

1760
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,368
Let's go.
What do you say?

1761
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:43,760
You doing good?
Yeah!

1762
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,285
All right.

1763
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:46,805
Hey, what's going on
with this guy, here?

1764
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,370
You don't get out
of the car anymore?

1765
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,568
What are you, too old?
Hey, Dad.

1766
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:51,926
How are you?
All right.

1767
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,605
Come on, let's get going here.

1768
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,603
Good to see you guys. Jump on
in, I'll be in in a minute.

1769
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,564
Hi, beautiful. How are you? Hi!

1770
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,410
Good to see you!

1771
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,408
So glad you're back.

1772
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,807
It's been a tough week.

1773
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:07,928
How about I drive?
Yes, please.

1774
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,486
<i>Flugelschlagen.</i>

1775
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:12,042
What? Something I
learned on my trip.

1776
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:15,124
It means, "You have
to fight like hell..."

1777
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:18,051
"but don't forget to catch
your breath now and then..."

1778
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,240
"and realize that everything's
gonna be all right."

1779
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:24,810
Or it means "turn left," probably.

1780
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:42,485
Hey, you have your assignment, yes?
Yes.

1781
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:43,961
Because it's due today.

1782
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,491
The "Dad" one?
Yeah.

1783
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:47,842
Shit. I was still working...

1784
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:50,526
I wrote it. I did it.

1785
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:51,681
You finished it?

1786
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:52,761
Mmm-hmm.

1787
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:54,605
It's good.

1788
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,170
She wrote it in,
like, 2 seconds.

1789
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:14,170
Can you feel?

1790
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:19,686
<i>Can you feel it?</i>

1791
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:21,724
<i>Now it's coming back</i>

1792
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,211
<i>We can steal it</i>

1793
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,284
<i>If we bridge this gap</i>

1794
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,771
<i>I can see you</i>

1795
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:29,810
<i>Through the curtains
of the waterfall</i>

1796
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,604
<i>When I lost it</i>

1797
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:35,250
<i>Yeah, you held my hand</i>

1798
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:36,925
<i>But I tossed it</i>

1799
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,729
<i>Didn't understand</i>

1800
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,211
<i>You were waiting</i>

1801
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:43,364
<i>As I dove into the waterfall</i>

1802
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:47,642
<i>So say Geronimo!</i>

1803
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:50,883
<i>Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!</i>

1804
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:57,691
<i>Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!</i>

1805
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,889
<i>Can you feel...</i>

1806
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:06,286
my <i>love?</i>

1807
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:09,728
<i>Bombs away Bombs away</i>

1808
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,325
<i>Bombs away</i>

1809
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,686
<i>Say Geronimo!</i>

1810
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:14,285
<i>Well, we rushed it</i>

1811
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:15,925
<i>Moving way too fast</i>

1812
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,240
<i>That we crushed it</i>

1813
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:19,244
<i>But it's in the past</i>

1814
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:21,089
<i>We can make this leap</i>

1815
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:23,606
<i>Through the curtains
of the waterfall</i>

1816
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,287
<i>So say Geronimo!</i>

1817
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:33,360
<i>Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!</i>

1818
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,603
<i>Can you feel...</i>

1819
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,486
my love?

1820
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:50,251
<i>Bombs away Bombs away</i>

1821
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:51,810
<i>Bombs away</i>

1822
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:54,922
<i>Well, I'm just a boy</i>

1823
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,445
<i>With a broken toy</i>

1824
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,170
<i>All lost and coy</i>

1825
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:59,765
<i>At the curtains
of the waterfall</i>

1826
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,524
<i>So it's here I stand</i>

1827
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,204
<i>As a broken man</i>

1828
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:04,964
<i>But I've found my friend</i>

1829
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,883
<i>At the curtains
of the waterfall</i>

1830
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,200
<i>Now I'm falling down</i>

1831
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,930
<i>Through the crashing sound</i>

1832
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:11,724
<i>And you've come around</i>

1833
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,404
<i>At the curtains
of the waterfall</i>

1834
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:14,891
<i>And you rushed to me</i>

1835
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,729
<i>And it sets us free</i>

1836
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,404
<i>So I fall to my knees</i>

1837
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:21,321
<i>At the curtains
of the waterfall</i>

1838
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:33,842
<i>When the world is turning
in the wrong direction</i>

1839
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:37,483
<i>And every wave seems to
be crashing at your feet</i>

1840
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:41,846
<i>Running circles doesn't
lead to inspiration</i>

1841
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:43,965
<i>When you're at the end</i>

1842
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:46,088
<i>You're at the start again</i>

1843
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:50,208
<i>Time's moving too slow</i>

1844
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:54,686
<i>One foot out the door</i>

1845
01:27:54,800 --> 01:28:00,648
<i>Binds you flat but know
that you're not alone</i>

1846
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:06,083
<i>Take a hand from me</i>

1847
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:10,846
<i>You know what we'll be,
you'll see</i>

1848
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:12,410
<i>If we fall and if we break</i>

1849
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,687
<i>There will be
another chance today</i>

1850
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:19,329
<i>Take a hand from me</i>

1851
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:29,802
<i>I believe that we can
find our destination</i>

1852
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:31,845
<i>The journey's just begun</i>

1853
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:34,567
<i>Two is more than one</i>

1854
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:38,567
<i>Time's moving too slow</i>

1855
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:42,680
<i>One foot out the door</i>

1856
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:48,882
<i>Binds you flat but know
that you're not alone</i>

1857
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:54,083
<i>Take a hand from me</i>

1858
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:58,601
<i>You know what we'll be,
you'll see</i>

1859
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,649
<i>If we fall and if we break</i>

1860
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:02,842
<i>There will be
another chance today</i>

1861
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:07,050
<i>Take a hand from me</i>

1862
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:10,642
<i>Whoa-oh-oh-oh</i>

1863
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:15,364
<i>Take a hand from me</i>
