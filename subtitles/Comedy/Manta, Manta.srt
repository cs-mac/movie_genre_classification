1
00:00:00,478 --> 00:00:02,139
And I'm in trouble.

2
00:00:03,148 --> 00:00:04,479
The rascal has a pistol!

3
00:00:05,483 --> 00:00:07,474
God knows what other
trouble you'll drag me into!

4
00:00:20,498 --> 00:00:21,897
Quiet...

5
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:32,908
Go away...

6
00:00:35,513 --> 00:00:36,980
Go...

7
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:51,122
- Finding them is tough.
- Let's go back. - Yes.

8
00:00:57,469 --> 00:00:59,460
''See, there was no need to scream.''

9
00:01:05,477 --> 00:01:06,944
What...?

10
00:01:14,486 --> 00:01:15,976
Where is it?

11
00:01:16,488 --> 00:01:17,978
Scared of a cockroach!

12
00:01:22,494 --> 00:01:23,893
Now...?

13
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,163
''I'll hold this cap up
and move it, they'll shoot''

14
00:01:32,504 --> 00:01:35,496
- And I'll die.
- Why? Don't die.

15
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,502
''I'll pretend. Then you stand
and scream, he's dead! ''

16
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:42,446
''The moment they come close to
catch you, I'll grab their gun.''

17
00:01:44,449 --> 00:01:47,441
Let me know when they
are about 20 feet away.

18
00:02:07,205 --> 00:02:09,139
He's dead!

19
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:11,874
Is that right? Dead!

20
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,472
He's dead! Very good Stay dead.

21
00:02:23,488 --> 00:02:25,888
40 feet.

22
00:02:28,493 --> 00:02:30,757
30 feet. Get ready.

23
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:36,492
''20 feet. Raghu, are you listening? ''

24
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:39,936
10 feet! Get up.

25
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:44,908
Get up!!

26
00:02:48,446 --> 00:02:50,437
''Raghu, get up! ''

27
00:02:56,454 --> 00:02:59,446
''- Enough, get up.
- Catch her.''

28
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,450
Don't touch me!

29
00:03:07,132 --> 00:03:09,123
- Get up!
- He's dead.

30
00:03:13,471 --> 00:03:16,463
Coward! Scaredy cat!

31
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,140
Hot air balloon!

32
00:04:41,993 --> 00:04:43,984
Excuse me...

33
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,662
you...? All alone over here?

34
00:04:53,004 --> 00:04:55,666
I left her with the aunt.
She was to have a baby.

35
00:04:56,007 --> 00:04:58,407
- What did you have?
- A girl - Great.

36
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,001
- Congratulations
- Congratulations

37
00:05:02,013 --> 00:05:05,005
- Have you seen her?
- Just now.

38
00:05:06,017 --> 00:05:08,008
- Some thugs carried her away.
- Thugs?

39
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:10,017
I'll show you.

40
00:05:15,026 --> 00:05:17,017
Advance!

41
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:20,020
Advance forward not back!

42
00:05:24,035 --> 00:05:26,970
''I said, I won't
call Daddy! Never! ''

43
00:05:31,976 --> 00:05:35,377
''Look, don't scream.''

44
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,709
We're not bad characters.

45
00:05:38,983 --> 00:05:41,975
You're hurt because you're kidnapped

46
00:05:42,387 --> 00:05:44,378
But we don't touch strange girls.

47
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:46,716
Don't touch girls! My foot!

48
00:05:47,992 --> 00:05:51,450
You are scoundrels!
Rascals! Swindlers!

49
00:05:53,998 --> 00:05:55,727
Quiet!

50
00:05:56,334 --> 00:05:57,733
Why do you scream so loud?

51
00:06:01,005 --> 00:06:07,001
If a rich father loses his child
he has to pay a lakh or two.

52
00:06:08,012 --> 00:06:10,742
That is why tell us
your father's phone number!

53
00:06:12,016 --> 00:06:15,008
So we're not in trouble.

54
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,514
- Tell us...
- You want the number?

55
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:20,422
Come close. I'll tell you.

56
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:55,390
Hit!

57
00:07:15,012 --> 00:07:16,411
There...

58
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:48,707
Hit him some more!

59
00:08:04,495 --> 00:08:06,395
Now where will you escape?

60
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,951
Lower! Down!!

61
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:08,982
No...

62
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:16,489
Duffer! No!

63
00:09:27,945 --> 00:09:30,607
Now where will you escape?

64
00:09:30,948 --> 00:09:34,281
- You thrashed us a lot.
- Bravo!

65
00:09:34,619 --> 00:09:36,280
What's in my hand?

66
00:09:39,957 --> 00:09:41,948
I'll blow you to smithereens.

67
00:10:20,998 --> 00:10:22,989
Save me!

68
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:32,933
''Let go, you egg head! ''

69
00:10:35,613 --> 00:10:38,946
- Let's go. - what?
- My cap!

70
00:10:39,951 --> 00:10:42,943
- No! Are you nuts?
- Let go!

71
00:11:17,388 --> 00:11:20,983
My heart is yours

72
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:23,984
Cupid struck me

73
00:11:26,931 --> 00:11:30,423
My heart is yours

74
00:11:31,936 --> 00:11:34,598
Cupid struck me

75
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,932
''You are my heart, my life''

76
00:11:39,944 --> 00:11:43,937
Only you

77
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,681
My heart belongs to you

78
00:11:50,354 --> 00:11:51,946
Cupid struck us

79
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,951
''My heart, my breath,
my life, my love''

80
00:11:58,963 --> 00:12:02,956
Only you

81
00:12:33,197 --> 00:12:36,928
''My heart is desirous
since I set eyes on you''

82
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:41,427
''My heart is desirous
since I set eyes on you''

83
00:12:42,673 --> 00:12:46,336
''You have no idea of
how much I love you''

84
00:12:46,944 --> 00:12:50,937
''You have no idea of
how much I love you''

85
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:55,542
''I can relate the
story of love to you''

86
00:12:56,353 --> 00:12:59,447
I can tell you what's in my heart

87
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,450
I can tell you what's in my heart

88
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:59,471
''You wouldn't know
what's in my heart''

89
00:14:05,422 --> 00:14:09,017
''I'm not to be blamed
if I fall for you''

90
00:14:14,031 --> 00:14:17,523
''You're a traveller and
I am your destination''

91
00:14:19,036 --> 00:14:22,528
''You are a song and
I am the gathering''

92
00:15:18,028 --> 00:15:19,757
Car... gone!

93
00:15:30,975 --> 00:15:33,375
What fun! How we fooled them!

94
00:15:33,978 --> 00:15:36,378
You're wonderful.
Risked your life for me.

95
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,980
- What if you'd died...?
- If I hadn't risked my life.

96
00:15:39,316 --> 00:15:40,647
You'd have died.

97
00:15:52,997 --> 00:15:55,329
- What's this?
- I don't know.

98
00:16:14,018 --> 00:16:16,486
Have you no shame calling
another's father your Dad?

99
00:16:23,027 --> 00:16:28,465
''Get this clear, you maybe
a big actor on big posters''

100
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,359
Or if stupid girls chase you...

101
00:16:31,969 --> 00:16:35,302
I have always hated you.

102
00:16:35,472 --> 00:16:36,632
And I always will hate you.

103
00:16:36,974 --> 00:16:38,965
You've told me this a hundred times.

104
00:16:39,376 --> 00:16:40,968
I'll say it all my life.
Sit down!

105
00:16:43,314 --> 00:16:46,374
I don't give a damn
about what you say.

106
00:16:46,984 --> 00:16:49,452
Pooja loves me and
wants to marry me.

107
00:16:49,987 --> 00:16:51,648
You can't stop us.

108
00:16:52,323 --> 00:16:55,315
''Mr. Actor, these dialogues
won't affect me one bit.''

109
00:16:55,993 --> 00:17:00,396
Pooja has left you.
You've failed to get her back.

110
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,998
I haven't slept a wink
I'm missing my daughter.

111
00:17:05,402 --> 00:17:06,994
Tell me where she is.
I want to see her!

112
00:17:10,674 --> 00:17:12,665
I give up. That's
why I've called you here.

113
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,342
2 dozen reporters are
waiting in my office.

114
00:17:16,013 --> 00:17:18,004
Tell them I accept
your marriage to Pooja.

115
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:20,010
Get Pooja from wherever she is!

116
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,011
There he comes.

117
00:17:29,226 --> 00:17:31,387
Mr. Dharamchand wants
to say something to you.

118
00:17:32,296 --> 00:17:34,958
I want to tell you that...

119
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:39,629
Deepak and I have decided to make up.

120
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,460
Photo.

121
00:18:01,992 --> 00:18:04,256
Look here... the dynamo broke.

122
00:18:05,996 --> 00:18:07,657
It will have to be welded.

123
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:12,999
- Where will I get the cash?
- You'll pay me later for repairs.

124
00:18:14,004 --> 00:18:17,997
Pay for the welding too.
I'll go get it done.

125
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,001
- How long will it take?
- I'll be back soon.

126
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,951
Great number. Turn it loud.

127
00:18:49,973 --> 00:18:52,965
''I'm a traveller on the
path of love, don't stop me''

128
00:18:55,979 --> 00:18:59,972
''I'm a traveller on the
path of love, don't stop me''

129
00:19:05,322 --> 00:19:08,985
''I belong to those
who meet me with love''

130
00:19:27,945 --> 00:19:31,938
I accept pain and succor

131
00:19:34,952 --> 00:19:38,945
I accept pain and succor

132
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:42,948
''I weave every kind
of flower into a garland''

133
00:19:45,963 --> 00:19:50,457
''I weave every kind
of flower into a garland''

134
00:20:13,323 --> 00:20:17,453
''Sunlight was in my fate
that's how I lived my life''

135
00:20:19,997 --> 00:20:23,990
''Sunlight was in my fate
that's how I lived my life''

136
00:20:24,401 --> 00:20:25,993
Madam! Your picture
is in the paper!

137
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:30,606
See what this says. Deepak
and Dharamchand have made up.

138
00:20:30,941 --> 00:20:33,603
''Dear, come back home.
I accept your marriage.''

139
00:20:33,944 --> 00:20:35,343
Look...

140
00:20:37,281 --> 00:20:39,681
I knew you were not ordinary.

141
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:43,351
''Madam, are you getting married? ''

142
00:20:43,554 --> 00:20:44,953
My wishes.

143
00:20:50,627 --> 00:20:51,958
Hurry up.

144
00:21:06,977 --> 00:21:08,569
- Come on.
- Found a room?

145
00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:11,573
- Agreed with great difficulty.
- Spoke about the money?

146
00:21:12,382 --> 00:21:16,648
I told him we'll stay a week.
We'll see what to say in the morning

147
00:21:16,987 --> 00:21:20,980
- You're great.
- Okay but I don't understand...

148
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:23,322
Why are you insisting
on staying the night?

149
00:21:23,594 --> 00:21:25,585
''Lf we leave now, we'll
be in Bangalore in 3 hours.''

150
00:21:25,996 --> 00:21:27,930
Till yesterday you were
in a rush to reach Bangalore.

151
00:21:31,335 --> 00:21:34,668
Whom will we meet at 3 AM?
Everyone will be sleeping.

152
00:21:37,941 --> 00:21:39,932
All right. Come on.

153
00:21:44,948 --> 00:21:47,610
Gave the room again
without taking advance!

154
00:21:48,218 --> 00:21:51,210
''I told you a hundred
times, don't trust anyone! ''

155
00:21:51,622 --> 00:21:54,955
''The boy is decent,
married owns a car.''

156
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:58,291
Such decent people
cheat and run away!

157
00:22:07,971 --> 00:22:09,461
Last stage.

158
00:22:11,975 --> 00:22:13,966
Tomorrow you'll reach home.

159
00:22:15,979 --> 00:22:17,970
Into your husband's arms.

160
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,447
And you'll write for the paper.

161
00:22:26,256 --> 00:22:27,655
Strange story.

162
00:22:40,937 --> 00:22:42,666
Will you come to see me?

163
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,931
- No.
- Why?

164
00:22:47,277 --> 00:22:49,939
I don't meet married women.

165
00:22:52,949 --> 00:22:54,940
You can come to ask about me.

166
00:22:55,952 --> 00:22:57,442
No way.

167
00:22:58,955 --> 00:23:02,948
Does this mean we'll
never meet again?

168
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,690
What's the need to meet me?
Your job has been done!

169
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,698
You had to reach
Deepak and you did!

170
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:13,959
That's all you wanted
from me! Talks nonsense!

171
00:23:14,371 --> 00:23:15,963
What is wrong with you?

172
00:23:58,014 --> 00:24:03,008
I am afflicted by love

173
00:24:04,421 --> 00:24:08,357
I am afflicted by love

174
00:24:11,027 --> 00:24:14,019
There's no hope for me

175
00:24:27,978 --> 00:24:32,381
People have started telling me

176
00:24:33,984 --> 00:24:37,977
People have started telling me

177
00:24:40,323 --> 00:24:43,724
There's no way I'll survive

178
00:25:34,311 --> 00:25:38,975
''Love burnt everything
and made me forget all''

179
00:25:40,317 --> 00:25:44,981
''Look at the state
love has reduced me to''

180
00:25:46,323 --> 00:25:48,655
I have lost myself

181
00:25:49,993 --> 00:25:51,984
A fire engulfs me

182
00:25:52,996 --> 00:25:57,399
''The world seems different
since I fell in love''

183
00:25:58,001 --> 00:26:02,404
My heart is not in control

184
00:26:05,008 --> 00:26:09,001
It doesn't hark my advice

185
00:27:11,408 --> 00:27:16,345
''Love made me;
love destroyed me''

186
00:27:17,514 --> 00:27:22,281
''Love made me, you and
the world come to its' knees''

187
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,011
Die for love

188
00:27:26,957 --> 00:27:28,686
Let's do something drastic

189
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,363
''Let's spread the
fragrance of love all around''

190
00:27:34,965 --> 00:27:39,425
''For your love, my love... ''

191
00:27:41,638 --> 00:27:45,233
I have given up the world

192
00:28:54,978 --> 00:28:56,969
It's only now that
I fully realise it.

193
00:28:57,981 --> 00:29:02,645
Don't ever leave me
I can't live without you.

194
00:29:04,654 --> 00:29:06,315
I know what you're thinking.

195
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,651
Don't think.

196
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,721
Let's elope!

197
00:29:11,995 --> 00:29:13,394
Everything will be fine.

198
00:29:13,997 --> 00:29:15,487
Everything will be fine.

199
00:29:26,276 --> 00:29:28,938
Don't be mad! Go to sleep!

200
00:29:35,351 --> 00:29:36,943
Go!

201
00:30:36,946 --> 00:30:41,940
Everything you said outside...
do you really...?

202
00:30:44,621 --> 00:30:45,952
Will you marry me?

203
00:30:59,435 --> 00:31:01,960
I'm going to Bangalore.
I'll be back by morning.

204
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:05,369
Have to arrange
money to get married.

205
00:31:07,977 --> 00:31:11,310
I too love you and want to marry you

206
00:31:11,981 --> 00:31:15,644
Wait for me. I'll be back
real soon with the cash.

207
00:31:17,987 --> 00:31:19,386
''Yours, Raghu.''

208
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,602
I don't have money.
You may keep my bag.

209
00:31:39,943 --> 00:31:42,935
How will the bag help?
I too have a bag.

210
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,271
- Know the price of fuel?
- Keep the spare wheel too.

211
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,282
When I return I'll give
you an extra 50 bucks.

212
00:31:50,954 --> 00:31:52,353
What?

213
00:31:52,956 --> 00:31:54,617
I don't have a cap.

214
00:32:00,697 --> 00:32:02,961
- Now fill her up.
- Right away.

215
00:32:24,988 --> 00:32:27,582
- You!
- Sir.

216
00:32:29,926 --> 00:32:32,417
You! Here!!

217
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,921
I don't want to see your face!

218
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:39,197
- Listen to me...
- Anybody there?

219
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,598
Get him out of here
and take me somewhere!

220
00:32:42,939 --> 00:32:44,930
Calm down my dear Sharma.

221
00:32:45,942 --> 00:32:47,933
I'm not dear!

222
00:32:48,945 --> 00:32:50,936
Don't take away my
freedom of speech.

223
00:32:51,948 --> 00:32:54,940
- Speak on.
- I respect you.

224
00:32:56,953 --> 00:32:58,352
This city has many papers.

225
00:32:58,955 --> 00:33:01,947
I come straight here
with any exclusive news.

226
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:06,952
To you. And now for
this year's greatest scoop...

227
00:33:07,363 --> 00:33:08,955
...is in my hands

228
00:33:09,966 --> 00:33:11,456
Shouldn't I come here to you?

229
00:33:12,235 --> 00:33:17,468
- Look into my eyes.
- Pooja is marrying Deepak.

230
00:33:17,974 --> 00:33:19,965
I know it.

231
00:33:22,645 --> 00:33:26,638
That's where you err
in knowing Raghu's genius.

232
00:33:27,984 --> 00:33:29,383
Meaning?

233
00:33:30,987 --> 00:33:35,981
Meaning if I throw a bombshell
that Pooja isn't marrying Deepak...

234
00:33:36,993 --> 00:33:39,723
Everything is settled
and she isn't marrying...

235
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,991
She's marrying another.

236
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:44,662
Are you drunk? Yes?

237
00:33:45,001 --> 00:33:49,665
Tell me news that Pooja is
marrying another not Deepak

238
00:33:50,473 --> 00:33:52,668
Is it exciting or not?

239
00:33:53,009 --> 00:33:54,738
''Yes, it is. So...? ''

240
00:33:55,345 --> 00:33:58,007
Give me 10000 and
the news is yours.

241
00:33:59,615 --> 00:34:03,016
''You're a cheat, vagabond.''

242
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,009
I don't trust you.

243
00:34:05,621 --> 00:34:09,022
If this news is false...
I'm dead meat.

244
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,020
Use your brains.

245
00:34:11,627 --> 00:34:15,427
''Lf I give false news,
will I survive in this line? ''

246
00:34:16,032 --> 00:34:17,294
Who will give me a job?

247
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:20,366
''They could sue me,
send me to prison.''

248
00:34:21,037 --> 00:34:23,437
And I'll be the first
to send you to jail.

249
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,031
All right. I accept.

250
00:34:26,476 --> 00:34:27,966
Whom is she marrying?

251
00:34:28,378 --> 00:34:31,438
''- Firs the cash.
- First the news, then the cash! ''

252
00:34:31,981 --> 00:34:33,312
Who is she marrying?

253
00:34:35,985 --> 00:34:37,384
Me.

254
00:34:42,992 --> 00:34:45,324
Get the car out.
I'm going home.

255
00:34:45,995 --> 00:34:47,485
It's true...

256
00:34:48,998 --> 00:34:50,989
Climb down from the
editor's seat for a minute.

257
00:34:51,334 --> 00:34:52,995
Look into my eyes.

258
00:34:53,336 --> 00:34:54,667
Am I lying to you?

259
00:35:04,013 --> 00:35:06,004
I met Pooja in a bus.

260
00:35:08,017 --> 00:35:11,748
We were together all the time
I fell in love with her.

261
00:35:14,023 --> 00:35:17,481
I love her
And she loves me.

262
00:35:19,028 --> 00:35:21,758
Right now I'm in a rush.
She must be waiting for me.

263
00:35:22,365 --> 00:35:25,027
She doesn't know I've
come to give you this news.

264
00:35:26,035 --> 00:35:28,970
Every minute is valuable.
And I have not a penny.

265
00:35:29,972 --> 00:35:33,373
''Under these circumstances, how
can I tell her I want to marry her? ''

266
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,972
''Yes, there is a story.''

267
00:35:41,984 --> 00:35:43,645
The story has essence.

268
00:35:44,987 --> 00:35:48,980
''Pooja, the daughter of the city's
richest man Dharamchand leaves... ''

269
00:35:49,992 --> 00:35:52,460
...home in a huff to meet her lover.

270
00:35:52,995 --> 00:35:55,987
En route she meets a
roadside Romeo.

271
00:35:56,399 --> 00:35:58,993
She falls in love with him.

272
00:36:00,002 --> 00:36:02,994
Yes! The story spins!

273
00:36:04,006 --> 00:36:05,997
Where is the story?

274
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:19,010
Get up! Finally
what I said came true!

275
00:36:19,422 --> 00:36:22,016
The boy ran away in the
car without paying up!

276
00:36:23,025 --> 00:36:25,016
- I didn't know...
- How will you?

277
00:36:25,528 --> 00:36:26,961
- You're always sleeping!
- Funny...

278
00:36:27,964 --> 00:36:30,626
Let's go and see
what's the condition.

279
00:36:30,967 --> 00:36:32,298
Hope he hasn't
taken away the fans.

280
00:36:41,477 --> 00:36:42,967
What...? What's the matter?

281
00:36:43,312 --> 00:36:44,973
Where's the husband you came with?

282
00:36:45,982 --> 00:36:48,974
The one in whose car you came.

283
00:36:49,986 --> 00:36:52,648
''- Must be here...
- Taken the bag, luggage... ''

284
00:36:52,989 --> 00:36:54,718
- There's nothing here.
- What?

285
00:36:55,324 --> 00:36:56,985
Who will pay the rent for the room?

286
00:36:57,326 --> 00:37:00,989
She'll pay! She gets clients
to do business! Why won't she pay?

287
00:37:01,397 --> 00:37:03,388
What nonsense! What are you saying?

288
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,661
Pay the room rent.

289
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:10,003
- I don't have money.
- Then get out of here!

290
00:37:12,008 --> 00:37:13,999
Get out!

291
00:37:15,011 --> 00:37:17,002
- Out
- But where will I go?

292
00:37:17,413 --> 00:37:19,472
None of our concern.
Go to hell!

293
00:37:20,016 --> 00:37:23,008
Drown yourself in a river
but get out of here!

294
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,955
Get out! Did you have to come to
this hotel for soliciting clients?

295
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:32,951
Don't touch the telephone!
Nor show your face again!

296
00:37:33,963 --> 00:37:36,955
This hotel is for
decent people. Get out!

297
00:38:11,334 --> 00:38:14,497
What's the news?
What's wrong with your voice?

298
00:38:16,005 --> 00:38:18,599
Where are you my dear?
Why are you crying?

299
00:38:19,008 --> 00:38:21,499
Tell me where you are.
I'll come to take you!

300
00:38:24,013 --> 00:38:25,742
Stay there. I'm coming.

301
00:38:29,952 --> 00:38:32,546
- You've made my life.
- Don't mention it.

302
00:38:32,955 --> 00:38:35,287
Your pen has the power.

303
00:38:35,958 --> 00:38:37,687
What a picture you paint!

304
00:38:39,629 --> 00:38:43,963
You are somewhat greedy
but no writer like you.

305
00:38:51,974 --> 00:38:54,966
Where the heck are you?
No! That story won't be printed.

306
00:38:55,378 --> 00:38:59,747
This one will be. I want
a pretty picture of Pooja.

307
00:39:00,983 --> 00:39:03,474
Where's the cartoon?
Sent the cartoonist here.

308
00:39:03,986 --> 00:39:07,979
I want a cartoon of Deepak
standing near the wedding hall.

309
00:39:08,457 --> 00:39:11,449
And Pooja waves bye to him
and leaves with another.

310
00:39:12,995 --> 00:39:14,485
''Good, isn't it? ''

311
00:39:15,998 --> 00:39:20,992
Send somebody and compose this.
That story won't be printed.

312
00:39:22,004 --> 00:39:23,995
Just a minute...

313
00:39:25,408 --> 00:39:26,932
Don't disturb me. I'm busy.

314
00:39:28,944 --> 00:39:31,606
- I don't want to hear it.
- Pooja spoke to Dharamchand.

315
00:39:32,948 --> 00:39:34,939
Pooja spoke to Dharamchand.

316
00:39:35,284 --> 00:39:36,683
She's come back home.

317
00:39:37,353 --> 00:39:38,945
What...?

318
00:39:40,956 --> 00:39:43,948
He fleeced me for 10000.

319
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,953
I won't spare you!
Call the cops! Arrest him!

320
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:34,671
''You'll be the bride
and I'll be the groom''

321
00:40:36,212 --> 00:40:40,273
''You'll be the bride
and I'll be the groom''

322
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:46,353
''Wait for me, I'll come
for you in a procession''

323
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:26,257
''Drums, music, horses and
elephants will accompany us''

324
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:34,267
''Drums, music, horses and
elephants will accompany us''

325
00:41:35,337 --> 00:41:39,933
I'll envelop you in my arms

326
00:41:41,944 --> 00:41:45,937
When the night of union approaches...

327
00:41:47,283 --> 00:41:51,276
''With talks of
romance on my lips... ''

328
00:41:51,954 --> 00:41:56,948
I'll keep you awake all night

329
00:42:06,969 --> 00:42:10,962
''I'll be the bride
and you'll be my groom''

330
00:42:12,308 --> 00:42:16,972
''I'll be the bride
and you'll be my groom''

331
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:21,973
I will die with love for you

332
00:42:56,952 --> 00:43:02,948
''Since you stepped into
my heart, my life partner... ''

333
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:16,961
''You've brought the love
of a lifetime with you''

334
00:43:18,374 --> 00:43:22,970
Since I first saw you...

335
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:28,313
I asked God for you

336
00:43:29,985 --> 00:43:33,477
I can't live without you

337
00:44:44,994 --> 00:44:47,485
''Did you hear, Pooja
went back to her father? ''

338
00:44:47,997 --> 00:44:50,659
Deepak is swinging.
What a crazy girl!

339
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:02,671
Give this money to Sharma.

340
00:45:04,013 --> 00:45:06,345
''And tell him, I was joking.''

341
00:45:07,016 --> 00:45:08,506
There was no such news.

342
00:45:12,688 --> 00:45:14,019
The flush doesn't work.

343
00:45:14,423 --> 00:45:17,415
Everyone cheats me of
my money. Money...?

344
00:45:18,027 --> 00:45:20,427
- Raghu returned it.
- Why?

345
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:23,021
He said that was a lie.

346
00:45:24,033 --> 00:45:25,523
Where is he?

347
00:45:36,378 --> 00:45:38,972
What is this?

348
00:45:41,383 --> 00:45:43,374
Thought I'd pull your leg.

349
00:45:45,988 --> 00:45:47,649
But the story was good?

350
00:45:49,992 --> 00:45:52,392
It happens. This happens in life.

351
00:45:52,995 --> 00:45:55,395
Man plans something but
something else happens.

352
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,731
Keep this. Get back when
you're in the mood. We'll talk.

353
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,299
I knocked but you...

354
00:46:40,976 --> 00:46:42,466
I was thinking.

355
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:49,314
Everything is arranged.
Your marriage is being talked.

356
00:46:50,986 --> 00:46:55,480
I hear Deepak will come in
a chopper for the wedding.

357
00:46:55,991 --> 00:46:57,390
I too heard that.

358
00:46:58,994 --> 00:47:02,395
It's madness according
to me but it's all right.

359
00:47:02,998 --> 00:47:04,989
He can do what he thinks is right.

360
00:47:17,012 --> 00:47:19,480
''Dear, what's wrong? ''

361
00:47:20,415 --> 00:47:22,406
- What is wrong?
- Nothing.

362
00:47:24,419 --> 00:47:27,946
You seem upset since you came.

363
00:47:28,957 --> 00:47:30,618
I'm worried abut you.

364
00:47:32,294 --> 00:47:34,956
Are the marriage preparations fine?

365
00:47:36,965 --> 00:47:38,626
Have Deepak and you...?

366
00:47:39,301 --> 00:47:44,967
- No. - If there's
something... it's not too late.

367
00:47:45,374 --> 00:47:47,968
Do you know my real
feelings about Deepak?

368
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,413
My child...

369
00:47:55,984 --> 00:47:57,975
I want you to be happy.

370
00:47:59,388 --> 00:48:02,380
I want to give you
the world's happiness.

371
00:48:03,992 --> 00:48:05,459
What is the matter?

372
00:48:07,996 --> 00:48:09,395
My baby...

373
00:48:20,008 --> 00:48:22,738
Are you in love with another?

374
00:48:34,957 --> 00:48:36,948
Love! You love somebody else!

375
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:38,951
Not Deepak? Fantastic!

376
00:48:39,962 --> 00:48:42,624
- Where did you meet him?
- In the bus.

377
00:48:43,365 --> 00:48:46,357
Bus...? Is he a bus conductor?

378
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:50,962
- No.
- Who is he?

379
00:48:51,974 --> 00:48:56,707
I don't know much about him
but I like him.

380
00:48:57,479 --> 00:48:59,970
You like the bus or him?

381
00:49:00,983 --> 00:49:03,975
- Him.
- Then why are you serious?

382
00:49:04,987 --> 00:49:06,477
No use.

383
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:08,650
He hates me!

384
00:49:10,392 --> 00:49:13,657
- Hates...? - He thinks I'm the
spoilt child of a rich father.

385
00:49:14,997 --> 00:49:16,988
Spoilt child of a rich man?

386
00:49:17,332 --> 00:49:18,663
He thinks something
similar about you too.

387
00:49:20,002 --> 00:49:21,993
He says you're
responsible for spoiling me.

388
00:49:22,337 --> 00:49:23,998
You didn't raise me well.

389
00:49:24,506 --> 00:49:25,996
Where is he?
I want to meet him.

390
00:49:26,341 --> 00:49:27,672
- I want to meet him.
- Don't know.

391
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:31,611
I must meet him. It's urgent!
This wedding has to be stopped.

392
00:49:31,947 --> 00:49:33,938
Stop it. Stop!!

393
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:36,941
- This marriage is wrong.
- Daddy...

394
00:49:37,953 --> 00:49:39,944
Send the groom back!

395
00:49:41,957 --> 00:49:43,948
I want the boy!

396
00:49:53,368 --> 00:49:54,960
I don't want to trouble you more.

397
00:49:56,371 --> 00:50:00,239
The boy was right. I kept
running around without thinking.

398
00:50:00,976 --> 00:50:02,466
What did I want?

399
00:50:02,978 --> 00:50:04,969
Now I must stop somewhere.

400
00:50:05,981 --> 00:50:07,573
I must hold somebody's hand.

401
00:50:10,986 --> 00:50:12,476
You've changed.

402
00:50:13,989 --> 00:50:15,650
You were a kid when
you bolted from the ship.

403
00:50:17,392 --> 00:50:19,986
But you've returned as a woman.

404
00:50:20,996 --> 00:50:22,987
This boy must have a hand in this.

405
00:50:23,498 --> 00:50:26,331
- The boy! I want the boy!
- You won't find Raghu now.

406
00:50:26,935 --> 00:50:28,926
Who won't be found?

407
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:32,671
What's his full name?

408
00:50:43,285 --> 00:50:44,616
What is this?

409
00:50:44,953 --> 00:50:46,944
Nothing... no...

410
00:50:54,963 --> 00:50:59,559
''Mr. Dharamchand, I want to
talk to you about money.''

411
00:50:59,968 --> 00:51:01,959
Concerning your daughter.

412
00:51:06,975 --> 00:51:09,705
- Will you see him?
- I'll have to.

413
00:51:10,312 --> 00:51:13,440
He found you so I must reward him.

414
00:51:19,254 --> 00:51:22,246
Do meet him and don't
forget to reward him.

415
00:51:22,991 --> 00:51:24,982
He was good company
during the journey.

416
00:51:25,994 --> 00:51:27,655
And do tip him.

417
00:51:39,608 --> 00:51:40,939
Pooja...!

418
00:51:53,455 --> 00:51:55,446
- Where's Pooja?
- Upstairs.

419
00:52:04,299 --> 00:52:05,698
I've come to take you.

420
00:52:06,968 --> 00:52:09,630
Get dressed. We're
going to a grand party.

421
00:52:10,972 --> 00:52:12,963
''- You'll come, won't you?
- Yes.''

422
00:52:26,922 --> 00:52:29,390
What's wrong with you?
Why are you standing morose?

423
00:52:30,926 --> 00:52:33,326
Every year you're the life
of the party. What's it now?

424
00:52:33,528 --> 00:52:34,927
I'm not in the mood.

425
00:52:35,931 --> 00:52:39,389
''Forget it. At this age,
girls come and go.''

426
00:52:39,935 --> 00:52:42,335
''Lf one girl leaves, will
you mope all your life? ''

427
00:52:45,941 --> 00:52:49,934
Stand near the door and
receive all the guests.

428
00:53:44,499 --> 00:53:47,991
You are the love of one man

429
00:53:49,004 --> 00:53:52,997
But another man loves you

430
00:53:54,342 --> 00:53:57,436
You are the love of one man

431
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:02,016
But another man loves you

432
00:54:03,351 --> 00:54:06,445
One man likes you

433
00:54:08,023 --> 00:54:11,459
One man likes you

434
00:54:12,427 --> 00:54:16,022
But somebody else wants you

435
00:54:44,993 --> 00:54:48,258
''What is ours and
what belongs to others''

436
00:54:49,397 --> 00:54:52,798
What is fact and what is fiction?

437
00:54:54,002 --> 00:54:56,994
''What is ours and
what belongs to others''

438
00:54:58,607 --> 00:55:02,270
What is fact and what is fiction?

439
00:55:03,011 --> 00:55:07,004
Who in the world knows?

440
00:55:08,016 --> 00:55:11,008
Who in the world knows?

441
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:16,015
You are in one man's vision

442
00:55:17,025 --> 00:55:21,018
But another steals glances

443
00:56:18,019 --> 00:56:21,011
This often happens in love

444
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:25,748
''One laughs while
another sheds tears''

445
00:56:26,628 --> 00:56:29,961
This often happens in love

446
00:56:31,366 --> 00:56:34,733
''One laughs while
another sheds tears''

447
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:39,371
One wins while another loses

448
00:56:39,974 --> 00:56:44,570
One wins while another loses

449
00:56:45,413 --> 00:56:48,974
You are the life of one

450
00:56:49,984 --> 00:56:53,715
''But somebody else
understands you''

451
00:57:49,644 --> 00:57:53,444
I wonder how I can keep mum

452
00:57:53,982 --> 00:57:57,975
''How can I bear the
pain in my heart? ''

453
00:57:58,987 --> 00:58:02,479
I wonder how I can keep mum

454
00:58:03,324 --> 00:58:06,987
''How can I bear the
pain in my heart? ''

455
00:58:07,996 --> 00:58:11,989
''How can I say
I'm facing a dilemma? ''

456
00:58:13,001 --> 00:58:16,334
''How can I say
I'm facing a dilemma? ''

457
00:58:17,405 --> 00:58:21,000
You are my only companion

458
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:26,003
None other walks beside me

459
00:59:40,955 --> 00:59:42,354
''Yes, this is Raghu Jaitly''

460
00:59:44,959 --> 00:59:46,449
''No, I won't come home.''

461
00:59:47,962 --> 00:59:49,429
I want to meet you in the office.

462
00:59:50,965 --> 00:59:54,628
L; m going to Bombay in 2 days
Then I might go to America.

463
00:59:55,303 --> 00:59:58,295
''Before I leave, I want
to clear your account.''

464
00:59:58,973 --> 01:00:03,307
But I don't want to come
in the midst of the wedding.

465
01:00:03,978 --> 01:00:07,971
That's none of your concern.
Come straight to my personal room.

466
01:00:10,652 --> 01:00:11,983
All right.

467
01:00:12,987 --> 01:00:17,981
I want to see your son-in-law
comes for marriage or a circus.

468
01:00:19,994 --> 01:00:21,985
- I hear he'll come in a chopper
- Yes.

469
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:25,993
Let's see this spectacle
What's the victory of love?

470
01:00:32,941 --> 01:00:34,408
Who is it?

471
01:00:36,945 --> 01:00:38,276
Yes.

472
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:51,425
I got your letter.

473
01:00:52,961 --> 01:00:55,953
Pooja told me about you.

474
01:00:57,966 --> 01:01:00,958
She never told me how you
helped her in the journey.

475
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:05,462
Your daughter is good
at forgetting favours.

476
01:01:07,976 --> 01:01:11,969
Don't mistake me. I meant
she didn't tell me till lately.

477
01:01:12,981 --> 01:01:16,417
''According to her,
you should get your dues.''

478
01:01:17,986 --> 01:01:19,977
Really? Full dues?

479
01:01:20,989 --> 01:01:22,456
That's good news.

480
01:01:23,992 --> 01:01:26,256
How should it be
according to you?

481
01:01:26,928 --> 01:01:32,696
I don't know. Must see what
right you have over the cash.

482
01:01:34,602 --> 01:01:36,934
I wouldn't come here
if I had no right.

483
01:01:39,941 --> 01:01:42,933
''Here, it's the complete account.''

484
01:01:44,946 --> 01:01:47,346
- Is it in English?
- You're holding it upside down.

485
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,612
Sorry once again.

486
01:02:15,977 --> 01:02:19,970
''Hotel rent Rs. 45, iron Rs. 2,
toothpaste 9.30 I mean 9.50.''

487
01:02:20,381 --> 01:02:22,975
''Tooth brush 3.25,
repairing car Rs. 75.''

488
01:02:23,384 --> 01:02:26,251
''1 cap Rs. 35, 1 shirt 45,
2 pants Rs. 235''

489
01:02:26,587 --> 01:02:28,145
''1 bag 135, 1 shirt 135.''

490
01:02:28,322 --> 01:02:29,914
1 girl er... lungi 37.

491
01:02:30,591 --> 01:02:31,922
Total Rs. 699.55.

492
01:02:32,927 --> 01:02:34,417
699.55?

493
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:38,262
I even had to sell
my socks and shaving kit.

494
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:39,930
I haven't charged for that.

495
01:02:40,334 --> 01:02:43,326
- That's fine but...
- What's it? This is less.

496
01:02:43,938 --> 01:02:46,406
One generally spends
a couple of 1000 on such trips.

497
01:02:46,941 --> 01:02:49,933
Just a minute. First
explain this to me...

498
01:02:50,344 --> 01:02:53,939
You want Rs. 699.55
apart from Rs. 100000?

499
01:02:54,949 --> 01:02:56,348
What lakh?

500
01:02:57,952 --> 01:03:00,944
- The reward.
- I didn't speak of that.

501
01:03:02,557 --> 01:03:06,220
I'm confused. Have you
come for the reward?

502
01:03:06,461 --> 01:03:09,430
I've only come for 699.55

503
01:03:09,964 --> 01:03:12,228
Pay up fast. I'm
getting suffocated here.

504
01:03:13,968 --> 01:03:15,560
You're quite a man.

505
01:03:16,971 --> 01:03:21,465
- We'll discuss it another day.
- Another man would come for a lakh.

506
01:03:21,976 --> 01:03:24,968
It's about principles.
You won't understand it.

507
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:30,383
When somebody makes a fool of me
and I have to pay the price...

508
01:03:30,985 --> 01:03:32,247
I don't accept that.

509
01:03:32,386 --> 01:03:33,978
Fool...?

510
01:03:35,389 --> 01:03:36,981
I was made a good fool.

511
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:41,992
- Will you pay or must I leave?
- Just a minute.

512
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,399
Rs. 700

513
01:03:50,004 --> 01:03:51,665
- What's this?
- 45 paise.

514
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:57,477
One moment.

515
01:03:58,746 --> 01:04:00,407
May I ask you one question?

516
01:04:01,015 --> 01:04:02,505
Yes.

517
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:07,510
Do you love my daughter?

518
01:04:12,026 --> 01:04:17,020
Any man who loves your daughter
should get his head examined.

519
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:21,031
That's not the answer.

520
01:04:22,036 --> 01:04:24,527
Your daughter has found
herself a good match.

521
01:04:26,574 --> 01:04:28,974
A strange specimen of today's times.

522
01:04:30,711 --> 01:04:34,977
Your daughter needs a man
who'll thrash her day and night.

523
01:04:36,717 --> 01:04:39,447
''Lf you had any sense, you'd
have done this a lot earlier.''

524
01:04:41,989 --> 01:04:43,479
Do you love my daughter?

525
01:04:44,992 --> 01:04:48,723
No simple man can live
with her and not turn mad.

526
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:50,991
I want nothing to do with her.

527
01:04:51,332 --> 01:04:52,731
Do you love her?

528
01:04:53,401 --> 01:04:56,996
Yes but I can't be blamed.

529
01:04:59,006 --> 01:05:00,337
I too am crazy.

530
01:05:19,026 --> 01:05:21,017
- Hope you've got the money.
- Right.

531
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:25,430
- Congratulations.
- To you too.

532
01:05:26,033 --> 01:05:27,398
Won't you stay for the wedding?

533
01:05:27,969 --> 01:05:31,769
It will be fun. You probably
would never have seen it.

534
01:05:35,243 --> 01:05:37,370
I don't like watching dramas.

535
01:05:42,984 --> 01:05:45,316
- I spoke to Raghu.
- I don't want to hear a word.

536
01:05:45,987 --> 01:05:49,650
- Listen...
- I don't want to hear a word.

537
01:05:52,994 --> 01:05:54,461
But...

538
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:37,699
''Come, my dear.''

539
01:06:54,989 --> 01:06:59,323
You're making a big
mistake marrying this man.

540
01:07:03,998 --> 01:07:05,659
Raghu is a good boy.

541
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,994
He didn't come for the reward.

542
01:07:10,004 --> 01:07:12,336
He wanted the money he spent on you.

543
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:20,005
Leave this marriage and run away.

544
01:07:21,415 --> 01:07:26,284
I'm probably the first father
to advise his child to elope.

545
01:07:28,956 --> 01:07:31,948
Before Raghu runs
away from your life...

546
01:07:32,693 --> 01:07:35,355
Sit in the car I've
parked behind and go away.

547
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:38,689
Your father's honour is at stake.

548
01:07:46,974 --> 01:07:50,740
How can you marry such an ass?

549
01:09:05,986 --> 01:09:10,980
My heart won't pay heed

550
01:09:22,002 --> 01:09:28,407
Why am I feeling anxious?

551
01:09:29,677 --> 01:09:32,942
The heart is unaware

552
01:09:41,956 --> 01:09:45,414
- What's wrong?
- How can I marry an ass like you?

553
01:09:46,627 --> 01:09:47,958
What are you doing?

554
01:09:51,966 --> 01:09:54,958
''Run away, dear! ''

555
01:10:03,978 --> 01:10:07,641
''Stop, where are you going?
What is wrong with you? ''

556
01:10:08,983 --> 01:10:10,974
Run away!

557
01:10:19,493 --> 01:10:20,983
What's going on?
Where has Pooja gone?

558
01:10:21,996 --> 01:10:25,397
She's always running away
so she ran away again!

559
01:10:40,948 --> 01:10:42,438
I want to go to Bombay.

560
01:10:42,683 --> 01:10:44,344
Will you please help me?

561
01:10:55,296 --> 01:10:59,960
God always gives generously.

562
01:11:05,973 --> 01:11:10,967
I love you

563
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:16,643
That's all I know

564
01:11:20,988 --> 01:11:27,325
I couldn't have lived alone

565
01:11:28,662 --> 01:11:31,927
Had I not found you...

566
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:42,209
''Distressed eyes,
anxious breath... ''

567
01:11:43,944 --> 01:11:46,936
repeatedly say...

568
01:11:50,951 --> 01:11:54,944
My heart does not understand

569
01:11:57,958 --> 01:12:02,452
My heart knows no reason
