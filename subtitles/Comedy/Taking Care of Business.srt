1
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:25,684
I live for the World Series, right?

2
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:28,275
I grew up in California,
so I follow the Angels.

3
00:02:28,405 --> 00:02:31,026
But I was born in Chicago, right?
So I don't know who to root for!

4
00:02:31,158 --> 00:02:32,438
The Angels or the Cubs.

5
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:36,525
If I say Angels, my dad'll kill me.
If I say Cubs, my friends'll kill me.

6
00:02:36,663 --> 00:02:40,162
I just can't wait!
So I've got seats behind home plate.

7
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:44,289
...closed at 23 and MKR Industries
closed up at 48.

8
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,706
It's a warmer 53 October degrees
in Chicago this morning.

9
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,043
We have early morning low clouds
which should be clearing midday,

10
00:02:51,176 --> 00:02:53,549
and we should see a high of 65.

11
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:56,929
But for now, let's return
to early morning classics.

12
00:03:06,274 --> 00:03:09,310
You're like a case study
in obsessive behaviour.

13
00:03:09,444 --> 00:03:11,483
I'm shaving.

14
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:16,400
And I'm messing up
your shaving schedule.

15
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,447
Just tell me you are not going
to do any work this weekend.

16
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,622
I promise, no work.

17
00:03:27,377 --> 00:03:31,920
Last weekend was an emergency.
This weekend it's you and me

18
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:36,377
and Lake Winnebago,
and I can't wait.

19
00:03:36,511 --> 00:03:39,262
Do you realise how long it's been?

20
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:42,010
Let's see.

21
00:03:43,809 --> 00:03:45,138
Spencer!

22
00:03:47,313 --> 00:03:51,180
As I recall...
it was very good.

23
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:01,945
Elizabeth!

24
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,159
Yes!

25
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:11,953
- Oh, my God!
- Yes!

26
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:13,795
- Oh, my God!
- Yes!

27
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,626
- Oh, my God!
- Yes!

28
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,465
Promise me one more thing.

29
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,965
I won't bring my Filofax. I promise.

30
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,929
The hometown fans need to
rally behind our Angels.

31
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,553
I'll be down there to greet them
and I urge you to join me

32
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,896
in welcoming them home
tomorrow morning at LAX.

33
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,184
For one fan I have an added incentive.

34
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,477
Cream of shit, seven days a week.

35
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:44,693
...correctly, two tickets to game 6
Sunday in Anaheim will be yours.

36
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:49,403
So, in honor of the Cubs, it's "What
two Cubs pitched no-hitters in 1972?"

37
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:50,997
milt Pappas. Burt Hooton.

38
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:52,866
Surprise!

39
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:57,000
Oh, man, guys!

40
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:04,047
Whatcha going to do when you get out?

41
00:05:04,177 --> 00:05:05,968
Get arrested!

42
00:05:06,095 --> 00:05:08,420
I wouldn't leave you guys
alone here, would I?

43
00:05:08,556 --> 00:05:10,465
Come on, speech!

44
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:23,314
Here's to the cubs
winning the World series.

45
00:05:25,655 --> 00:05:27,814
And to big tits!

46
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:34,701
Hey, Warden!

47
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:36,159
How you doing?

48
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:40,537
Gentlemen, this is
an unauthorized festivity.

49
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:45,130
These guys are just throwing
a going-away party, nothing big, special.

50
00:05:46,008 --> 00:05:48,712
Well, it's over.

51
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:51,711
Pull that banner down.

52
00:05:57,811 --> 00:06:01,559
Mr Dworksi, this is a prison.

53
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:04,180
Not a discotheque.

54
00:06:04,317 --> 00:06:08,445
You're my responsibility until
your release time Sunday night at 6:00.

55
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:11,904
That's 60 hours.
Understood?

56
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:15,276
Yes, sir.

57
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:16,655
Thank you.

58
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:20,951
Before he gets out of here,
I'll burn that troublemaker.

59
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,458
Don't worry about it, Jimmy!

60
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:25,122
We're still looking for a winner
for those tickets to game 6.

61
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:27,411
Now, this morning's question again,

62
00:06:27,547 --> 00:06:31,461
"What two Cubs pitched
no-hitters in 1972?"

63
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:35,092
The number to call, 555-7720.

64
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:37,925
They're giving tickets away
to the World series.

65
00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:40,180
Yeah, so?

66
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:45,765
So... 555-7720! 555-7720.

67
00:06:52,362 --> 00:06:55,279
Breathe, breathe. That's great!

68
00:06:59,702 --> 00:07:02,027
Don't forget my frozen yogurt, baby.

69
00:07:02,163 --> 00:07:03,871
Can I use the phone?

70
00:07:03,998 --> 00:07:05,457
- Goodbye, Yolanda.
- Bye, honey.

71
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,038
- Sure thing.
- Bye, Yolanda. Thank you.

72
00:07:29,397 --> 00:07:31,271
- You're on the air.
- On the air?

73
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,806
- What's your name?
- Jimmy Dworski.

74
00:07:33,943 --> 00:07:38,023
- Where are you calling from?
- I'm calling from... my car.

75
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:40,907
All right! now go for the tickets.
What do you think?

76
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:44,865
Yes, for the tickets.
Milt Pappas, Burt Hooton.

77
00:07:44,995 --> 00:07:49,039
Hooton and Pappas.
You got a winner! That's what you got!

78
00:07:49,165 --> 00:07:53,377
Yes, sir. Meet me at Los Angeles Airport
tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.

79
00:07:53,503 --> 00:07:57,037
I won! I won! I won!
I'm gonna see the cubs!

80
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:05,844
He hopes the sale of the fifth
will be easier

81
00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:09,389
now that they've been widely advertised.

82
00:08:09,518 --> 00:08:10,517
Walter.

83
00:08:10,644 --> 00:08:12,720
This is such a shock.

84
00:08:12,854 --> 00:08:14,728
Ah, that's part of business, Spencer.

85
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:20,731
Listen, what do you know
about the high quality foods account?

86
00:08:21,654 --> 00:08:24,988
I read this morning that
Sakamoto's Japanese syndicate

87
00:08:25,116 --> 00:08:27,868
bought high quality
and 86'd the GpG Agency.

88
00:08:27,994 --> 00:08:30,994
That's a huge account. huge account!

89
00:08:31,122 --> 00:08:32,948
Spencer, I want it.

90
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:36,621
I need you to take my place this weekend.

91
00:08:36,752 --> 00:08:38,744
- This weekend?
- You're going to L.A.

92
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,663
You're going to pitch our ideas
for their new national campaign.

93
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,334
Something dynamic.
Something with pretty girls.

94
00:08:47,846 --> 00:08:49,091
Something wrong?

95
00:08:49,222 --> 00:08:52,139
Elizabeth and I were going to Wisconsin...

96
00:08:52,267 --> 00:08:55,600
Sakamoto is flying out
just to see our campaign.

97
00:08:56,896 --> 00:09:00,395
They'll work through the weekend.
You'll meet him at the Malibu Tennis club.

98
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:03,194
Sort of a "Get to know you" kind of game.

99
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:06,687
It'll be a strategy review meeting
with the president.

100
00:09:06,822 --> 00:09:07,937
Diane Connors.

101
00:09:08,073 --> 00:09:09,781
She's a nightmare.

102
00:09:09,908 --> 00:09:13,988
But you compliment her left and right,
you be very nice to her.

103
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:15,745
You kiss her ass.

104
00:09:15,872 --> 00:09:20,285
- My wife and I were going to Wisconsin...
- If you pull this thing off...

105
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:25,370
you're looking at a senior vice-presidency.

106
00:09:25,506 --> 00:09:27,997
I'll cancel it.

107
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,758
- Good one!
- Very good.

108
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:41,303
Warden, this is the first time in my life
that I've ever had good luck.

109
00:09:41,438 --> 00:09:42,980
I only got two days left.

110
00:09:43,106 --> 00:09:45,597
Jimmy, please.

111
00:09:46,735 --> 00:09:49,938
Besides, if I let you go,
I'd have to let everybody go.

112
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:54,365
If I let everybody go,
this isn't a prison, it's a country club.

113
00:09:54,492 --> 00:09:58,240
I understand.
That's a good point, but you know

114
00:09:58,371 --> 00:10:01,371
it's the cubs in the World series.
It's a dream of mine, sir.

115
00:10:01,498 --> 00:10:02,957
I know, I know.

116
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:07,033
All right, I'm not gonna stand
in the way of anybody's dream, Jimmy.

117
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,957
- I'll tell you what...
- What?

118
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,091
If I sink this putt, you can go.

119
00:10:13,218 --> 00:10:16,752
- What do you think of that?
- Keep your head down,

120
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:20,008
arms straight, drop your shoulder,
concentrate, focus.

121
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:22,430
Think of the hole,
get the ball in the hole.

122
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,059
Smell the hot dogs, the crack of the bat,
the roar of the crowd.

123
00:10:26,188 --> 00:10:28,975
You can order your tickets now.

124
00:10:33,487 --> 00:10:36,653
Oh, shit! shit, shit, shit!

125
00:10:36,782 --> 00:10:40,233
Look, I'm sorry,
I know I deserve those 36 months.

126
00:10:40,368 --> 00:10:43,453
But I've been good, I haven't hurt anybody,
I've been good in here.

127
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,821
Mostly, a lot.

128
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:50,375
37 counts of Grand Theft Auto.

129
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:54,963
I like cars. You like cars.
People like cars.

130
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:57,249
You've been in and out of here
for 10 years.

131
00:10:57,384 --> 00:11:01,299
A half a day. I'll make it up when
I come back. I'll give you two weeks.

132
00:11:02,264 --> 00:11:04,470
Ok, I'll give you two weeks solitary.

133
00:11:05,684 --> 00:11:07,143
No can do.

134
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:10,638
Lighten up, will ya?
This game is so important to me.

135
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:14,900
This is just a minimum security prison,
for Christ's sake.

136
00:11:15,026 --> 00:11:18,691
I mean, a maximum minimum security
prison. It's a tough prison.

137
00:11:18,821 --> 00:11:20,648
Take away his TV privileges.

138
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:24,731
You can't take away my TV.
I gotta watch the game!

139
00:11:24,869 --> 00:11:26,446
Please don't be an asshole, all right?

140
00:11:27,705 --> 00:11:29,531
Did you call me an asshole?

141
00:11:29,665 --> 00:11:33,413
- I didn't call him an asshole, did I?
- Yep.

142
00:11:33,544 --> 00:11:37,623
Take away everyone's TV privileges
and let them know whose fault it is.

143
00:11:37,756 --> 00:11:39,962
No one is gonna watch the game.

144
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:41,467
No, you can't...

145
00:11:42,427 --> 00:11:45,344
- No one watches the game!
- I didn't mean to call you an asshole.

146
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,176
That's not what I meant.
I meant asswipe!

147
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,383
And you, you look like an asshole!

148
00:11:50,518 --> 00:11:52,391
You look like another asshole!

149
00:11:54,563 --> 00:11:57,350
Mr. Bentley's address is at the top
of the yellow page.

150
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:01,101
The key to his Malibu beach house
and instructions for the alarm system

151
00:12:01,236 --> 00:12:05,364
are in these clear pouches. business notes
and itinerary in the blue section.

152
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,064
High quality foods sales information
in the red section.

153
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:10,573
You'll keep the ad art
in your suitcase.

154
00:12:10,704 --> 00:12:13,823
I have you on a 5:00 a.m. flight.
Sleep on the plane.

155
00:12:13,957 --> 00:12:16,079
Limo will pick you up at 8:45.

156
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:18,332
Tennis meeting at 11:15.

157
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:20,703
Drinks with Diane Connors at 6:30.

158
00:12:20,838 --> 00:12:25,132
You'll spend all day Sunday
at high quality.

159
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:28,793
Your Filofax is all set,
so it should be smooth sailing.

160
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:30,209
Thanks, Brenda.

161
00:12:32,683 --> 00:12:34,841
I canceled your vacation.

162
00:12:34,976 --> 00:12:36,720
Elizabeth is gonna kill me.

163
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:39,391
Shall I send flowers again?

164
00:12:39,522 --> 00:12:41,266
Candy?

165
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,478
Balloons!

166
00:12:43,484 --> 00:12:44,895
Lots of balloons.

167
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:49,025
Elizabeth, no, don't!
You love balloons!

168
00:12:49,156 --> 00:12:52,110
I have no choice.
What would you have said? no?

169
00:12:52,243 --> 00:12:57,035
Maybe you would have said no, but this
could mean a senior vice-presidency.

170
00:12:57,164 --> 00:13:00,912
He's been dangling that
senior vice-presidency at you for years.

171
00:13:01,043 --> 00:13:03,415
- This is different.
- Again?

172
00:13:03,545 --> 00:13:04,660
Don't you see?

173
00:13:04,796 --> 00:13:09,837
He could have chosen clay or Chris
or Richard, but he chose me.

174
00:13:09,968 --> 00:13:13,419
Where are you going?
I've worked hard to work this hard.

175
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:18,512
I'll go to LA, get this account, and the
day I get back we'll leave for Hawaii.

176
00:13:18,643 --> 00:13:21,133
I'll ask Walter for a whole week off!

177
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,595
I promise.

178
00:13:23,731 --> 00:13:25,889
Elizabeth... All right.

179
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,899
- Where will you be?
- A hotel.

180
00:13:30,028 --> 00:13:31,985
What hotel?

181
00:13:35,784 --> 00:13:37,741
All right!

182
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,199
I hate that son of a bitch.

183
00:13:46,335 --> 00:13:50,333
That warden's a son of a bitch.
And I hate him!

184
00:13:51,882 --> 00:13:54,124
Jimmy, man, out of sight!

185
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:56,667
I can't believe
he isn't letting us watch the game.

186
00:13:56,803 --> 00:14:00,053
Did he do that golfing shit with you?

187
00:14:00,182 --> 00:14:02,803
- Yeah.
- I hate that shit!

188
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:04,642
We can't let him push us around.

189
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:06,845
There's hundreds of us,
ain't but one of him.

190
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,387
Yeah... Let's kill him.

191
00:14:10,775 --> 00:14:14,475
J.B., you are such an eloquent spokesman
for the minimum security system.

192
00:14:14,612 --> 00:14:16,651
Shut the fuck up, Hamilton!

193
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:21,071
We don't need violence.
What we need is organization.

194
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:22,909
A work stoppage maybe?

195
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,239
Out of here!

196
00:14:31,294 --> 00:14:34,129
- Oh, Jimmy, man, beautiful!
- Nice one, James!

197
00:14:41,387 --> 00:14:43,629
- Hamilton's right.
- What?

198
00:14:43,764 --> 00:14:47,465
I'm going to the World series!
I'm going to the World series!

199
00:14:47,601 --> 00:14:50,602
You break out,
you'll get 16 months mid-security.

200
00:14:50,729 --> 00:14:52,638
I'm going to the World series,

201
00:14:52,773 --> 00:14:56,817
where the Chicago cubs are gonna beat
the California Angels.

202
00:14:56,943 --> 00:15:01,570
They'll search your ass down, man.
You won't even get to the game.

203
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:04,782
Not if they don't know I'm gone.
Not if we strike!

204
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:06,368
You guys wanna help me out?

205
00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:11,279
You guys wanna watch the game,
party all weekend or what?

206
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,992
The cubs are gonna win the World series!

207
00:15:15,586 --> 00:15:17,246
And I'll be there!

208
00:15:23,093 --> 00:15:25,501
You're down the aisle and to the left.

209
00:15:32,393 --> 00:15:34,018
Nice Filofax.

210
00:15:34,562 --> 00:15:36,638
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

211
00:15:36,773 --> 00:15:38,516
Spencer Barnes?

212
00:15:40,484 --> 00:15:42,276
Spencer Barnes?

213
00:15:43,946 --> 00:15:45,226
Debbie Lipton!

214
00:15:45,364 --> 00:15:47,689
Ashcroft high!

215
00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:48,824
Oh...

216
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:51,109
- How are you?
- Oh, God.

217
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:55,787
Oh, my God!
It's good to see you. You look good.

218
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,873
You used to cheat off me in history.

219
00:15:58,001 --> 00:15:59,000
That's right!

220
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:02,496
You got me into
Chicago community college.

221
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,745
You did, thank you.

222
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:05,874
So, are you two together?

223
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:08,416
No? because my seat's over there.

224
00:16:08,553 --> 00:16:11,043
Why don't we switch
so Spencer and I can reminisce?

225
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,552
- Great!
- Ok.

226
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:16,387
- I've got a lot of work.
- It's Ok, I'll help you!

227
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:18,890
- This is an event.
- No problem.

228
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:21,309
- I'm happy to.
- You mind? I don't mind!

229
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,681
You never know when
you'll bump into people.

230
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,771
No. It's amazing.

231
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,777
Great! I love the window!

232
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,147
- So, how are you?
- Oh, I'm...

233
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,527
You know I'm in makeup?

234
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,149
I was in Chicago
for a moisturizer convention.

235
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:39,615
So, what have you been up to
for the last 25 years? What?

236
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,871
- They've barricaded themselves inside.
- What the hell do they want?

237
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,747
To watch the World series.

238
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,878
They've taken Jimmy Dworski hostage,
and won't let him go till after the game.

239
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:54,544
- They love Dworski!
- Not since you took away their TV.

240
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:55,960
Ah, shit!

241
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,223
To watch the game, huh?
All right...

242
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:02,558
This is the warden!

243
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:05,230
This is the warden!

244
00:17:05,356 --> 00:17:07,147
Cool it, it's the warden!

245
00:17:09,944 --> 00:17:11,402
What the hell's going on?

246
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:13,984
Warden! Is that you?

247
00:17:14,114 --> 00:17:15,229
This is me.

248
00:17:15,365 --> 00:17:19,695
This is J.B.
We got a list of demands for you.

249
00:17:20,495 --> 00:17:24,244
First, we want a
refrigerator in every cell.

250
00:17:29,712 --> 00:17:34,173
And oatmeal cookies
every Tuesday and Thursday.

251
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:43,755
We want a laptop computer for Hamilton.

252
00:17:48,105 --> 00:17:49,104
Safe!

253
00:17:49,231 --> 00:17:52,066
And we're gonna watch
the World series game!

254
00:17:52,192 --> 00:17:56,439
And if you come in here,
we're gonna kill Dworski.

255
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,532
Help me, man. help me.

256
00:18:04,662 --> 00:18:07,746
They've got me tied up, man.
They're gonna kill me.

257
00:18:07,873 --> 00:18:10,447
I don't want to die!

258
00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:12,707
I'm scared! help!

259
00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:15,040
Hear that?

260
00:18:15,923 --> 00:18:20,964
We're not gonna surrender, Warden,
until after the game.

261
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:35,146
Take me out to the ball game

262
00:18:35,274 --> 00:18:38,690
Take me out to the crowd

263
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:47,823
Then I got divorced again last year,
but everyone saw that one coming.

264
00:18:47,953 --> 00:18:51,535
Alan worked for NASA,
but he was no rocket scientist.

265
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:55,164
Now I'm on the prowl.
It's hard to find a good man.

266
00:19:06,804 --> 00:19:08,713
Yeah... Yeah!

267
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:13,804
I gotta shop here more often.

268
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
Hey!

269
00:19:25,363 --> 00:19:27,901
Do you have a favourite designer?

270
00:19:28,032 --> 00:19:31,732
You should. mine's Carl Lagerfeld.
I think he's great.

271
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:34,579
It's the Angels.

272
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,622
Oh, my God!

273
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:42,253
I love baseball players.
They're so big.

274
00:19:45,257 --> 00:19:49,254
Here you go, Jimmy.
Congratulations. Enjoy the game.

275
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:52,256
Any words to the Angel fans
out here, Jimmy?

276
00:19:53,514 --> 00:19:54,712
Yeah, Stu.

277
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:58,633
Cubs are gonna kick butt! Yeah!

278
00:20:07,694 --> 00:20:09,817
Where is he?

279
00:20:11,365 --> 00:20:13,986
- Need a ride, Spencer?
- No, thanks. I'm being met.

280
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:19,865
There's a reason
we were on that flight together.

281
00:20:19,998 --> 00:20:22,074
We were both going to LA.

282
00:20:24,127 --> 00:20:26,748
I'm talking about karma, Spencer.

283
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:29,714
About infinite possibility.

284
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,003
About us.

285
00:20:32,426 --> 00:20:35,178
I understand about this Natalie person.

286
00:20:35,304 --> 00:20:36,303
Elizabeth.

287
00:20:36,388 --> 00:20:39,555
All I'm saying is,
I think you're on the rebound.

288
00:20:39,683 --> 00:20:42,553
No, I'm happily married, honestly.

289
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:44,927
All I'm saying is...

290
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:51,317
I'm your friend in LA.
I want you to have my number.

291
00:20:52,945 --> 00:20:55,567
- Thanks.
- Don't be afraid to call me.

292
00:20:55,698 --> 00:20:57,737
Thanks a lot.

293
00:20:57,867 --> 00:20:59,943
Ok.

294
00:21:00,077 --> 00:21:02,034
- I appreciate it.
- Call me.

295
00:21:02,162 --> 00:21:04,238
Goodbye.

296
00:21:07,251 --> 00:21:09,243
Ah, no...

297
00:21:12,547 --> 00:21:16,960
The white zone is for loading and
unloading of passengers only.

298
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:18,718
No parking.

299
00:21:31,649 --> 00:21:35,349
You've reached the Barnes' residence.
Please leave a message.

300
00:21:35,485 --> 00:21:39,483
Elizabeth, I just want to say
I love you.

301
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:42,532
I miss you already
and I'm really sorry.

302
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:46,526
I'm in the terminal
and I love you very much.

303
00:21:46,663 --> 00:21:48,287
I'll try to be better.

304
00:21:48,414 --> 00:21:51,498
I love you very much.
Talk to you soon.

305
00:22:00,301 --> 00:22:03,088
- Hello?
- Brenda, listen, my luggage is lost.

306
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,340
The car's not here.
I can't be late for these meetings.

307
00:22:06,473 --> 00:22:09,806
You're lucky you caught me.
I'm on my way out.

308
00:22:09,935 --> 00:22:12,425
Hold on, I have to get the limo number.

309
00:22:12,562 --> 00:22:14,555
I see him! I'll talk to you later.

310
00:22:15,857 --> 00:22:17,896
Driver! chauffeur driver!

311
00:22:18,026 --> 00:22:19,520
Barnes!

312
00:22:29,745 --> 00:22:31,784
Yeah, baby, yeah.

313
00:22:32,498 --> 00:22:35,617
No, I swear I wasn't cheating on you.

314
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:38,540
No, it was just a friend.

315
00:22:52,016 --> 00:22:54,933
O1,000 reward?

316
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,341
1,000 bucks!

317
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:02,190
What the hell's wrong with you?

318
00:23:02,317 --> 00:23:04,725
We're not getting any younger!

319
00:23:05,362 --> 00:23:07,568
This is a mess.

320
00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:13,117
- Hello.
- Spencer.

321
00:23:13,244 --> 00:23:14,619
How are you feeling?

322
00:23:14,746 --> 00:23:18,873
Rotten. When you play tennis
with Sakamoto, lose.

323
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,791
He's really competitive.

324
00:23:20,918 --> 00:23:23,124
Your losing will show respect.

325
00:23:23,254 --> 00:23:24,664
Absolutely.

326
00:23:25,422 --> 00:23:31,295
That's great because I'm going
to be tested... for a bypass.

327
00:23:31,428 --> 00:23:33,670
Oh, Walter, a bypass?

328
00:23:33,805 --> 00:23:36,723
Now don't worry, Spencer.

329
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,135
You get the account and I'll live.

330
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,598
Consider it done.

331
00:23:42,397 --> 00:23:44,555
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

332
00:23:54,408 --> 00:23:56,484
- Have you seen my Filofax?
- Nope.

333
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:58,741
Oh, my God! my life is in there.

334
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:07,079
Meet me at the terminal!

335
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:10,129
I can't. I've got
an important pickup in 45 minutes.

336
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:33,850
Wow!

337
00:24:33,987 --> 00:24:36,774
This guy's loaded!

338
00:24:36,906 --> 00:24:37,906
Man.

339
00:24:38,032 --> 00:24:39,147
Thanks.

340
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:44,493
- Have a nice day!
- If the cubs win, it'll be a great day.

341
00:25:04,391 --> 00:25:07,226
The Flintstones must live here.

342
00:25:07,352 --> 00:25:09,428
Big lake!

343
00:25:16,235 --> 00:25:17,943
Yes, sir!

344
00:25:19,071 --> 00:25:20,530
Surf's up!

345
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,423
Ok, thank you.

346
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,924
Membership has its privileges.

347
00:25:43,052 --> 00:25:45,804
They Ok'd your credit
even without your card.

348
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:46,929
Great!

349
00:25:49,975 --> 00:25:51,932
- Today's not your day.
- Why?

350
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:56,521
It's the World series weekend
and we're all out of cars.

351
00:25:56,648 --> 00:25:59,056
No, I must have a car!

352
00:25:59,192 --> 00:26:02,395
In 20 minutes, I have
the most important business meeting.

353
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:05,814
I must have a car. Anything, please!

354
00:26:05,949 --> 00:26:08,902
- Well, there is one.
- I'll take it!

355
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:13,032
- But it's due for body work.
- That's all right. Let me have it.

356
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,885
"Spencer Barnes."

357
00:26:33,016 --> 00:26:35,886
credit cards.

358
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:37,678
More credit cards.

359
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,140
Lots of credit cards.

360
00:26:41,607 --> 00:26:43,564
Phone numbers.

361
00:26:46,362 --> 00:26:47,986
Power words.

362
00:26:48,113 --> 00:26:49,857
First-rate.

363
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,318
Phenomenal.

364
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,407
Superlative.

365
00:26:54,411 --> 00:26:56,119
Benevolent.

366
00:26:56,246 --> 00:26:57,823
Bullshit.

367
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:04,251
Alarm instructions?

368
00:27:11,135 --> 00:27:12,380
All right.

369
00:27:17,891 --> 00:27:20,133
Yeah! sweet.

370
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:31,188
Wow!

371
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,150
I'm on fucking dynasty.

372
00:27:38,035 --> 00:27:42,780
Yeah! All right!

373
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:20,157
Cute.

374
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,536
That's a weird couch.

375
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,007
I bet the chicks dig this place.

376
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:54,222
...at the Milton K. Prochik
Correctional Facility for a live update

377
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,100
on the World series strike.

378
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,310
No violence has yet been reported.

379
00:28:58,444 --> 00:29:01,529
Still, this minimum security prison
World series strike

380
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:05,736
could be the most unique
human interest story of the year.

381
00:29:05,868 --> 00:29:09,367
To get a better assessment,
let's talk with the warden,

382
00:29:09,496 --> 00:29:13,364
Mr. Frank Toolman, at the Milton K.
Prochik Correctional Facility.

383
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,786
Let me get your appraisal
of what's going on here.

384
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,170
This is not a serious situation.
It does not call for violence.

385
00:29:20,298 --> 00:29:23,797
They're men of good will
and we're currently talking.

386
00:29:23,927 --> 00:29:26,299
So, there's no reason for violence.

387
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,554
This is relaxing.

388
00:29:29,682 --> 00:29:34,308
Not at all. It's indicative
of a slight miscommunication.

389
00:29:38,607 --> 00:29:43,150
We're currently in negotiations.
The situation will be under control soon.

390
00:29:43,362 --> 00:29:45,769
I don't think so!

391
00:29:45,906 --> 00:29:49,321
A small demand. small concession.

392
00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:54,035
You're certain the situation
can be handled without violence?

393
00:29:54,164 --> 00:29:55,163
Don't move.

394
00:30:00,253 --> 00:30:02,874
- Yeah?
- Airline, I got your luggage.

395
00:30:03,005 --> 00:30:04,416
My luggage?

396
00:30:04,548 --> 00:30:05,924
You Spencer Barnes?

397
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,212
That's me.

398
00:30:07,343 --> 00:30:09,584
Great. nice place.

399
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,918
No shit.

400
00:30:35,286 --> 00:30:36,531
Excuse me?

401
00:30:36,662 --> 00:30:38,536
Pardon me!

402
00:30:38,664 --> 00:30:40,288
Excuse me?

403
00:30:40,415 --> 00:30:43,915
Could you direct me
to the San Diego freeway?

404
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:51,999
Yeah... Go two blocks down
and take a right.

405
00:30:52,135 --> 00:30:54,341
Two blocks down and take a right?

406
00:30:55,596 --> 00:30:57,090
Thanks a lot.

407
00:30:57,223 --> 00:30:59,429
I appreciate it. Thanks a lot.

408
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:06,266
- No money?
- I lost my Filofax. I lost all my money.

409
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:07,773
He's clean, man.

410
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,014
- No money?
- No money.

411
00:31:13,363 --> 00:31:15,237
What? no!

412
00:31:16,324 --> 00:31:18,897
No!

413
00:31:30,129 --> 00:31:33,249
Man, I need to get one of these in my cell.

414
00:31:33,382 --> 00:31:35,920
Sometimes he's the most loving guy,

415
00:31:36,051 --> 00:31:39,087
and sometimes he's inconsiderate
of my feelings.

416
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:40,845
Talk to him.

417
00:31:40,972 --> 00:31:44,175
But tell him that you
really would like to have

418
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:50,513
a straightforward talk
and see what the results would be.

419
00:31:50,648 --> 00:31:53,020
I tried, I really tried.

420
00:31:53,151 --> 00:31:55,476
He's a very hard person to talk to.

421
00:31:55,611 --> 00:31:57,900
I really love him...

422
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,188
Ditch him. find a better guy.

423
00:32:00,324 --> 00:32:02,400
Confront him in an honest way.

424
00:32:02,534 --> 00:32:05,072
Be straightforward and talk.

425
00:32:05,204 --> 00:32:07,529
By ignoring your situation,

426
00:32:07,664 --> 00:32:10,369
you are lying to yourself.

427
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,707
If this really matters to you,

428
00:32:12,836 --> 00:32:17,414
get it clear in your head
what you want to say.

429
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:20,419
Then tell him.
Don't play games.

430
00:32:20,551 --> 00:32:21,631
Not bad.

431
00:32:21,761 --> 00:32:26,304
I think you're right.
Maybe I just haven't been honest.

432
00:32:26,432 --> 00:32:28,923
This guy is worth it.

433
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:31,052
Spencer Barnes, where are you?

434
00:32:48,745 --> 00:32:50,821
- Spencer Barnes.
- Hi, Ned Bradford.

435
00:32:50,955 --> 00:32:54,240
Junior VP, high quality foods.

436
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:57,791
Mike Stewart, assistant to the president.
It's a pleasure.

437
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,419
- So, you ready for the big game?
- Yeah, I won two tickets!

438
00:33:04,134 --> 00:33:06,672
Walter wanted to get these
to you as soon as possible.

439
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:15,846
I think there's a high quality girl
in there.

440
00:33:15,979 --> 00:33:19,430
These are high quality girls, all right.
Check this one out.

441
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:20,763
Nice, huh?

442
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,272
Sakamoto wants
to choose the girl himself.

443
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:26,818
But I'm sure he's curious to hear you
dimensionalize once you meet them.

444
00:33:26,947 --> 00:33:30,233
Me? I get to meet these girls?

445
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:31,992
You get to meet all of them.

446
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:34,610
I got a great fucking job, don't I?

447
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,869
Listen, we ought to get going.

448
00:33:36,998 --> 00:33:39,750
You know how important punctuality
is to Mr Sakamoto.

449
00:33:39,876 --> 00:33:42,581
You really should put on your togs.

450
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:45,421
Togs?

451
00:33:47,216 --> 00:33:48,876
This is gonna be fun, guys.

452
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,338
Don't go away.

453
00:33:51,554 --> 00:33:54,923
Togs? What the hell are togs?

454
00:33:55,057 --> 00:33:57,133
Togs!

455
00:33:58,435 --> 00:34:00,511
Where the hell are my togs?

456
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:29,254
Oh, my God.

457
00:34:35,971 --> 00:34:37,678
We're happy with the new plan.

458
00:34:37,806 --> 00:34:42,514
With expanded exposure, we're confident
we can increase our net-net by 30%%.

459
00:34:42,644 --> 00:34:43,643
Whatever.

460
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:48,478
- What about the new slogans?
- First-rate, phenomenal.

461
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:52,226
Superlative. Diane is very anxious
to hear them. so is big Sak.

462
00:34:52,361 --> 00:34:54,235
- Big mac?
- No, Mr. Sakamoto.

463
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:03,734
- What's up?
- Glad to meet you, Mr. Barnes.

464
00:35:03,872 --> 00:35:05,615
Yes.

465
00:35:09,502 --> 00:35:11,495
Where are the girls?

466
00:35:14,006 --> 00:35:16,924
I thought we could meet the girls now
and play ball later.

467
00:35:17,051 --> 00:35:19,293
Tennis now. business later.

468
00:35:21,013 --> 00:35:23,682
I haven't checked out tennis in a while.

469
00:35:24,391 --> 00:35:27,842
Modesty. An admirable quality.

470
00:35:30,272 --> 00:35:31,932
I can't play worth a shit.

471
00:35:32,065 --> 00:35:35,185
That's good.
Remember, this is client tennis.

472
00:35:35,318 --> 00:35:37,607
You ready for a little action?

473
00:35:37,737 --> 00:35:40,193
You bet your ass I am.

474
00:35:43,284 --> 00:35:44,743
Spencer, we're on this side.

475
00:35:46,871 --> 00:35:49,326
Tennis relaxes the nerves.

476
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:52,667
Prepares us for better business.

477
00:35:52,793 --> 00:35:54,371
May the best man win.

478
00:36:23,947 --> 00:36:25,358
Good catch!

479
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,862
Slippery handle!

480
00:36:31,705 --> 00:36:32,985
Nice catch.

481
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:37,331
I got it, just give me a second.

482
00:36:38,878 --> 00:36:40,586
I'm up to bat.

483
00:36:40,713 --> 00:36:42,373
You need any talc?

484
00:36:44,675 --> 00:36:45,675
Ok.

485
00:36:45,718 --> 00:36:46,963
Ok, shoot!

486
00:36:54,476 --> 00:36:56,054
Defective shot!

487
00:36:56,937 --> 00:36:59,807
All right. Let's play ball!

488
00:37:00,649 --> 00:37:03,898
This is a disaster.
Everything was in my Filofax.

489
00:37:04,027 --> 00:37:05,984
My schedule, my sales charts.

490
00:37:06,112 --> 00:37:09,232
I don't even have Walter's number.
He's unlisted.

491
00:37:09,365 --> 00:37:11,073
My money, my credit cards.

492
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,241
I knew you'd call. I got home,
looked at the phone and said, "ring."

493
00:37:16,372 --> 00:37:20,239
It did. When the operator said,
"Collect call from Spencer Barnes,"

494
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:21,490
my face lit up.

495
00:37:21,627 --> 00:37:24,248
If Walter hears how I screwed up,

496
00:37:24,379 --> 00:37:27,250
he'll have another heart attack.
Then imagine the guilt!

497
00:37:27,382 --> 00:37:31,166
California's so romantic.
Wanna go for a walk on the beach?

498
00:37:31,302 --> 00:37:32,927
I've got a meeting to go to.

499
00:37:33,054 --> 00:37:36,838
I've gotta face these people empty-handed.
I can't even remember the slogans.

500
00:37:36,974 --> 00:37:41,435
Spencer, I used to have a crush on you.

501
00:37:46,275 --> 00:37:48,314
Sorry!

502
00:37:48,444 --> 00:37:50,519
Learn how to drive. sorry.

503
00:37:52,614 --> 00:37:56,825
I don't know. sometimes,
I lose control of myself.

504
00:37:58,745 --> 00:38:02,659
I've been going through
a rough period lately, Spencer.

505
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,747
My dog Maybelline died recently.

506
00:38:04,876 --> 00:38:09,870
She was so outgoing... and intelligent.

507
00:38:10,881 --> 00:38:14,131
She was... here, I've got this picture.

508
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,169
She was a Capricorn.

509
00:38:16,887 --> 00:38:18,346
Isn't she sweet?

510
00:38:18,472 --> 00:38:23,928
- She doesn't even look sick.
- That's an old picture.

511
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,809
Let me cook dinner for you.
It'll be a blast.

512
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:30,264
Come on... please!

513
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,775
This is not a good time.

514
00:38:31,901 --> 00:38:34,439
- Why?
- Do you know how to get to Malibu?

515
00:38:36,322 --> 00:38:38,813
Maybe.

516
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:48,541
I got it!

517
00:38:56,716 --> 00:39:00,500
- I'm bad. I'm really bad.
- Don't you think we ought to lose?

518
00:39:00,637 --> 00:39:02,878
- Lose? Why?
- Because Sakamoto wants to win.

519
00:39:03,014 --> 00:39:04,556
So do I, mike.

520
00:39:05,266 --> 00:39:06,843
Come on, I'm bad.

521
00:39:12,356 --> 00:39:14,230
Triple set point.

522
00:39:34,835 --> 00:39:37,161
- What happened?
- We won.

523
00:39:37,296 --> 00:39:38,375
We won?

524
00:39:40,049 --> 00:39:41,211
We won!

525
00:39:41,342 --> 00:39:42,373
Well played, sir.

526
00:39:45,429 --> 00:39:47,635
- Good match, Mr. Barnes.
- Thank you.

527
00:39:47,764 --> 00:39:50,220
Until this afternoon.

528
00:39:54,938 --> 00:39:56,480
What's with Mr. Attitude?

529
00:39:56,606 --> 00:40:00,853
- Has he never lost before?
- Not to an employee.

530
00:40:00,985 --> 00:40:02,313
Mr. Spencer Barnes!

531
00:40:02,445 --> 00:40:04,236
- Me!
- Telephone.

532
00:40:04,363 --> 00:40:06,107
Phone, yes.

533
00:40:06,991 --> 00:40:08,900
- Telephone, huh?
- For you, sir.

534
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:10,694
I wonder who it could be.

535
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:18,542
- Yeah, what's up?
- Thank god I found you.

536
00:40:18,668 --> 00:40:21,455
Walter's under anesthetic.
We have an emergency.

537
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:24,505
Honey nut Bakery needs
their new slogan immediately.

538
00:40:24,632 --> 00:40:28,796
I know Walter had something in mind,
but I can't remember what.

539
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:31,805
Check out those buns!

540
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:33,758
Great. Thanks.

541
00:40:36,477 --> 00:40:37,757
Hello?

542
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:41,522
Careful!

543
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,985
Thanks a lot.

544
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,946
- You're not free for dinner?
- I'm sure.

545
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:50,780
- Thanks a lot.
- Have fun.

546
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,742
- Sorry!
- Watch it.

547
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,330
I almost lost this baby.

548
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,991
We have children in this house.

549
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,328
- Broken glass is...
- Excuse me.

550
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,494
Could you help me?

551
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:09,841
Oh, of course I can.

552
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,292
Here's a dollar.

553
00:41:12,427 --> 00:41:14,669
Might be some leftovers
behind the restaurant.

554
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,180
Leftovers?

555
00:41:16,306 --> 00:41:18,133
No, I was mugged.

556
00:41:18,266 --> 00:41:22,050
I'm Spencer Barnes with Bentley
Advertising. I'm here for a tennis date.

557
00:41:22,187 --> 00:41:23,729
Your party just left.

558
00:41:23,855 --> 00:41:25,397
Damn!

559
00:41:25,523 --> 00:41:26,982
- Is there a problem?
- Yes.

560
00:41:27,108 --> 00:41:30,274
- I'm Spencer Barnes.
- Really? You're Spencer Barnes?

561
00:41:30,403 --> 00:41:35,195
Some very important materials in a
suitcase were sent to Mr. Bentley's house.

562
00:41:35,324 --> 00:41:39,108
- I must have his address.
- I'm not authorized...

563
00:41:39,244 --> 00:41:42,364
- This is urgent!
- Search the Rolodex, I'll break your arms.

564
00:41:42,497 --> 00:41:45,582
- You'll break my arms?
- That's right.

565
00:41:45,709 --> 00:41:49,409
For your information, Spencer Barnes
was here and he just left.

566
00:41:49,546 --> 00:41:54,006
For your information, he's still here
'cause I'm Spencer Barnes.

567
00:41:54,133 --> 00:41:56,126
- Is that right?
- That's right.

568
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,719
That's right!

569
00:41:57,845 --> 00:41:59,505
Take it outside!

570
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:02,842
Anyway, I get home
and Harold is sitting in his chair.

571
00:42:02,975 --> 00:42:04,350
Not saying a word.

572
00:42:04,476 --> 00:42:06,765
He's watching TV,
sitting like a turtle.

573
00:42:06,895 --> 00:42:11,189
I say to him, "Hello, Harold!"

574
00:42:12,067 --> 00:42:13,347
he didn't answer.

575
00:42:13,485 --> 00:42:16,604
Finally I say to him, look, Harold,
it's been this way for a month.

576
00:42:16,738 --> 00:42:19,027
He says to me finally, "Tuna fish."

577
00:42:19,157 --> 00:42:23,071
Tuna fish, he's talking
about my damn tuna fish.

578
00:42:36,965 --> 00:42:39,088
Holy shit!

579
00:42:55,483 --> 00:42:56,858
Hi.

580
00:42:56,984 --> 00:42:57,984
Hi.

581
00:43:00,196 --> 00:43:01,654
You must be Spencer.

582
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,987
Spencer? That's what they call me.

583
00:43:04,116 --> 00:43:07,070
Hi, I'm Jewel. I'm Walter's daughter.

584
00:43:07,202 --> 00:43:10,322
I just got off the phone with my father.
He's looking for you.

585
00:43:10,455 --> 00:43:11,455
Me?

586
00:43:12,582 --> 00:43:15,155
Well, I'm here.

587
00:43:17,378 --> 00:43:19,003
Yeah, there you are.

588
00:43:21,591 --> 00:43:25,802
I'm just gonna swim a little bit,
so don't mind me.

589
00:43:25,928 --> 00:43:27,719
No, I don't mind you.

590
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:33,387
Thank you, God!

591
00:43:39,566 --> 00:43:42,271
Wow, this feels great!

592
00:43:43,486 --> 00:43:45,728
Water, you know.

593
00:43:45,864 --> 00:43:48,189
- Wanna join me?
- Me?

594
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:51,906
Sure! Yeah!

595
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:04,125
- Hi.
- Hi, can I help you?

596
00:44:04,256 --> 00:44:08,384
I've never seen this office.
I just wanted to say hello. Walter Bentley.

597
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:11,131
Ira Breen. club accountant.

598
00:44:11,262 --> 00:44:13,006
Pleasure to meet you.

599
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:17,177
So, you're the one who sends me the bills?

600
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:19,018
That's me.

601
00:44:20,688 --> 00:44:22,099
That's a beauty.

602
00:44:22,231 --> 00:44:25,481
Yeah, this is the NEC Powermate Two.

603
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:28,693
286 CPU, two 8-bit full-size slots.

604
00:44:29,571 --> 00:44:33,818
40 Mb internal tape drive back-up,
40 Mb hard drive?

605
00:44:33,951 --> 00:44:35,326
80!

606
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,908
Wow! You really know your stuff!

607
00:44:39,914 --> 00:44:42,073
Do you mind? can I just take a look?

608
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:43,667
Not at all.

609
00:44:44,669 --> 00:44:48,797
- This is a real treat.
- It's a real treat for me.

610
00:44:48,923 --> 00:44:51,046
No one ever comes in here.

611
00:44:56,388 --> 00:44:59,058
Boy, we got a lot of members!

612
00:44:59,183 --> 00:45:00,641
There I am!

613
00:45:00,767 --> 00:45:02,226
Excuse me.

614
00:45:02,352 --> 00:45:04,677
Ira Breen. club accountant.

615
00:45:05,981 --> 00:45:07,439
Yes...

616
00:45:09,943 --> 00:45:11,686
can I ask you something?

617
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,859
- Honestly.
- Sure.

618
00:45:13,988 --> 00:45:16,906
What do you think about my father?

619
00:45:17,033 --> 00:45:20,448
I don't know.
I never really think of him.

620
00:45:27,334 --> 00:45:30,086
This heart attack thing
has really made me think.

621
00:45:30,212 --> 00:45:34,459
Just about the big picture,
about how superficial our relationship is.

622
00:45:36,176 --> 00:45:38,583
He's so involved in his work.

623
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:43,300
It's like he doesn't even know who I am.

624
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:48,186
And if I ever sound unhappy,
he sends me a check.

625
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:50,388
- A check?
- Well...

626
00:45:54,693 --> 00:45:58,477
- Why don't you try talking to him?
- No one talks to my father.

627
00:45:59,906 --> 00:46:01,864
You know that.

628
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:04,364
He sits and does all the talking.

629
00:46:11,251 --> 00:46:13,706
Try confronting him in a honest way.

630
00:46:13,836 --> 00:46:17,964
Be straightforward and true.

631
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,173
With Walter Bentley?

632
00:46:22,511 --> 00:46:26,461
By ignoring your own situation,
you're only lying to yourself.

633
00:46:27,432 --> 00:46:30,054
If it really matters to you,

634
00:46:30,185 --> 00:46:33,269
get it clear in your head
what you want to say and say it.

635
00:46:33,396 --> 00:46:34,476
Don't play games.

636
00:46:43,781 --> 00:46:45,240
You think?

637
00:46:48,702 --> 00:46:51,407
There is something
very different about you.

638
00:46:52,122 --> 00:46:53,782
Yeah, there is.

639
00:46:58,045 --> 00:46:59,290
I don't know what it is,

640
00:46:59,421 --> 00:47:03,833
but you're not the typical anal
yuppie I guess I was expecting.

641
00:47:04,175 --> 00:47:06,880
Definitely not.
I've never been one of the those.

642
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:12,963
- What are you doing for dinner?
- Dinner?

643
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:16,765
- You've got plans.
- For dinner? plans? no way.

644
00:47:16,896 --> 00:47:19,102
I don't even have one plan.

645
00:47:19,231 --> 00:47:21,900
I'm available.

646
00:47:29,783 --> 00:47:32,986
Great. so... pick me up at 8:00?

647
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:36,696
8:00 would be great!

648
00:47:43,462 --> 00:47:45,336
Yeah!

649
00:47:45,464 --> 00:47:47,006
Hello?

650
00:47:47,132 --> 00:47:48,959
Hi. ls Spencer there?

651
00:47:49,093 --> 00:47:52,876
Sure. hang on a second.
Spencer? Spencer!

652
00:47:53,013 --> 00:47:54,673
I'm busy.

653
00:47:56,391 --> 00:47:58,929
He's in a Jacuzzi.
Can he call you back?

654
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:02,809
What's he doing... Listen,
would you tell him it's Elizabeth

655
00:48:02,939 --> 00:48:06,806
and I'm returning his call
and I'd like to speak to him now?

656
00:48:06,943 --> 00:48:08,982
Hang on.

657
00:48:09,112 --> 00:48:12,527
Spencer, it's Elizabeth.

658
00:48:12,657 --> 00:48:15,776
Tell her I'll call her back.

659
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:19,362
He's gonna have to call you back.

660
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:22,663
Tell him not to bother.

661
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:30,088
You have no idea how grateful I am.
Thank you very much.

662
00:48:30,215 --> 00:48:33,465
I was just leaving the house,
about to close the door...

663
00:48:33,593 --> 00:48:34,921
and I thought of you.

664
00:48:35,053 --> 00:48:36,796
Just then, the phone rang.

665
00:48:36,929 --> 00:48:39,088
I'm telling you, it's karma.

666
00:48:39,223 --> 00:48:44,679
This is an unbelievable offer,
an unbelievable offer of quality

667
00:48:44,812 --> 00:48:47,267
and craftsmanship for you
and your family.

668
00:48:47,439 --> 00:48:52,646
Are you ready?
Just o999.00.

669
00:48:52,778 --> 00:48:56,146
Grab the credit cards. o999.00.

670
00:48:56,281 --> 00:48:58,072
Can you believe what I just said?

671
00:48:58,199 --> 00:49:01,983
If you've got a credit card,
you'd be crazy not to call now.

672
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:06,781
For a limited time, we'll call it
our World series special.

673
00:49:06,916 --> 00:49:11,791
We'll deliver almost anywhere
in just 24 hours.

674
00:49:12,546 --> 00:49:13,546
Yes, hello.

675
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:18,091
I'd like to buy that big screen TV.

676
00:49:20,012 --> 00:49:21,292
Can that be delivered?

677
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:23,967
Yes, California county Jail.

678
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:26,387
Care of Lebradford brown, please.

679
00:49:26,518 --> 00:49:28,594
American Express.

680
00:49:28,728 --> 00:49:30,471
3712...

681
00:49:30,605 --> 00:49:32,847
3456...

682
00:49:32,982 --> 00:49:37,478
7895006

683
00:49:37,612 --> 00:49:39,604
Thank you.

684
00:49:39,739 --> 00:49:41,778
Lebradford'll love this.

685
00:49:43,117 --> 00:49:44,777
Holy shit.

686
00:50:02,427 --> 00:50:04,336
God, I love running on sand.

687
00:50:05,888 --> 00:50:08,296
How you doing?

688
00:50:08,432 --> 00:50:10,306
- How's it going, man?
- Great.

689
00:50:10,434 --> 00:50:13,139
Boy, you guys look benevolent.

690
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:15,013
- Thanks.
- Is that yours?

691
00:50:15,147 --> 00:50:16,475
That's beautiful.

692
00:50:16,607 --> 00:50:17,805
Let's go for a beer.

693
00:50:17,941 --> 00:50:20,147
We can't, really.
We don't have time.

694
00:50:20,277 --> 00:50:21,475
Shall we?

695
00:50:21,611 --> 00:50:22,726
Shall we what?

696
00:50:22,862 --> 00:50:25,899
- We've got a meeting.
- This is getting complicated.

697
00:50:26,032 --> 00:50:30,610
You ought to put your suit on.
Diane's pretty compulsive about her time.

698
00:50:34,373 --> 00:50:37,457
I'd love to go, guys,
but I've got a hot date.

699
00:50:37,585 --> 00:50:39,826
- A date?
- With a chick.

700
00:50:39,962 --> 00:50:43,295
We understand you do things
a little differently.

701
00:50:43,424 --> 00:50:47,338
Ted and I like it, but if you miss
this meeting, it's business suicide.

702
00:50:47,469 --> 00:50:49,011
I'll be in deep shit?

703
00:50:49,137 --> 00:50:50,466
Precisely.

704
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:54,600
- I get to ride in that?
- Yeah.

705
00:50:54,726 --> 00:50:56,635
Homies, I'll be back in a sec.

706
00:50:58,062 --> 00:50:59,307
Homies?

707
00:51:01,732 --> 00:51:05,600
Yes, sir. uh-huh.

708
00:51:05,736 --> 00:51:11,525
Hmm... no. hmm... no.
No.

709
00:51:18,498 --> 00:51:21,701
No, no, no, no... yes.

710
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:36,133
Spencer Barnes... You look first-rate.

711
00:51:36,265 --> 00:51:38,222
Phenomenal.

712
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:39,844
Superlative.

713
00:51:39,977 --> 00:51:42,016
And benevolent.

714
00:51:44,523 --> 00:51:46,266
Fucking A, man.

715
00:51:56,326 --> 00:51:58,401
...five four.

716
00:52:03,749 --> 00:52:04,780
Ok.

717
00:52:07,294 --> 00:52:09,002
Thanks a lot, Debbie.

718
00:52:09,129 --> 00:52:12,332
- Sure you're not free for din-din?
- No, I really am.

719
00:52:12,466 --> 00:52:13,960
Next time, I promise.

720
00:52:14,092 --> 00:52:19,679
If you change your mind, I work
at the cosmetic counter at I Magnin.

721
00:52:19,806 --> 00:52:21,964
- I take lunch between 1:00 and 2:00.
- Goodbye!

722
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,176
Ask for Susan.
Susan will come get me.

723
00:52:28,105 --> 00:52:30,264
Wait! I'm here!

724
00:52:30,399 --> 00:52:32,937
Come back! I'm here!

725
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:01,757
Oh, no!

726
00:54:24,924 --> 00:54:26,797
I'll kill him!

727
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:45,393
- Hello?
- Spencer!

728
00:54:45,527 --> 00:54:49,654
- Walter!
- I told you to lose to Sakamoto.

729
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:53,989
I heard you beat him
in three straight sets.

730
00:54:54,118 --> 00:54:55,826
That wasn't me!

731
00:54:55,953 --> 00:54:58,526
What do you mean?
Take responsibility.

732
00:54:58,664 --> 00:55:00,703
It was somebody else.

733
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:06,456
Yes, and he's been screwing up.
I'm getting chest pains.

734
00:55:07,422 --> 00:55:12,084
Go out and get that account, damn it!

735
00:55:12,218 --> 00:55:14,211
Walter, let me explain...

736
00:55:17,265 --> 00:55:19,008
freeze!

737
00:55:20,643 --> 00:55:22,351
Man, I don't know.

738
00:55:22,478 --> 00:55:25,016
- What's the matter? You nervous?
- Kind of.

739
00:55:25,147 --> 00:55:28,314
Don't worry about Diane.
Relax.

740
00:55:28,442 --> 00:55:30,684
- Be yourself.
- Like us.

741
00:55:30,819 --> 00:55:34,022
Diane. ls Philip there, please?

742
00:55:36,616 --> 00:55:38,609
I'll be with you in a minute.

743
00:55:38,743 --> 00:55:39,743
This one?

744
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:42,656
I don't want excuses,
I want results.

745
00:55:42,789 --> 00:55:46,573
- I want you to finish that report...
- can I get you a drink?

746
00:55:46,709 --> 00:55:50,292
- I'll have a gimlet.
- Same.

747
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:53,621
Do you have that tequila
with the worms in it?

748
00:55:53,758 --> 00:55:57,589
- No.
- Then I'll have a gimlet.

749
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,585
Very good, sir.

750
00:55:58,721 --> 00:56:00,760
Be in touch.

751
00:56:00,889 --> 00:56:02,597
I told you to proof-read this.

752
00:56:02,724 --> 00:56:05,298
There are two spelling errors,
the columns are off,

753
00:56:05,435 --> 00:56:08,140
and the staple is vertical not horizontal.

754
00:56:08,271 --> 00:56:12,434
Spencer Barnes, Diane Connors.

755
00:56:12,567 --> 00:56:15,437
- I've heard good things.
- Right.

756
00:56:18,573 --> 00:56:21,822
I like your strategy.

757
00:56:21,951 --> 00:56:26,826
Beating the owner of the company
in tennis. smart way to get attention.

758
00:56:26,955 --> 00:56:29,790
I was just trying to win.

759
00:56:29,917 --> 00:56:33,250
Exactly.
We're all trying to win.

760
00:56:34,171 --> 00:56:39,212
When I heard you beat Sakamoto,
I knew I was gonna like you.

761
00:56:42,553 --> 00:56:45,091
Mr Sakamoto.

762
00:56:46,015 --> 00:56:47,557
Good Evening, ms Connors.

763
00:56:49,018 --> 00:56:52,351
Hey, big Sak!
What's up, man?

764
00:56:53,856 --> 00:56:56,607
I've never had such
a competitive opponent.

765
00:56:56,733 --> 00:56:59,403
You play an unusual game of tennis.

766
00:56:59,528 --> 00:57:01,983
Unusual, but effective.

767
00:57:02,114 --> 00:57:04,189
You're not so bad yourself.

768
00:57:04,324 --> 00:57:06,696
You gotta choke up on that racket.

769
00:57:06,826 --> 00:57:09,151
Let's get down to business, shall we?

770
00:57:10,997 --> 00:57:16,239
Now Bentley is in first place
to take over our national ad campaign.

771
00:57:16,377 --> 00:57:19,627
Now, here's the deal, Spencer.

772
00:57:19,755 --> 00:57:23,753
Friday's close was at 56.
One of the most active stocks traded.

773
00:57:23,884 --> 00:57:24,883
Smoke?

774
00:57:27,387 --> 00:57:30,092
I don't smoke,
but a couple of my friends do.

775
00:57:30,223 --> 00:57:32,797
Mind if I take some?

776
00:57:32,934 --> 00:57:34,512
Thank you.

777
00:57:34,644 --> 00:57:36,720
My point is this:

778
00:57:36,855 --> 00:57:40,603
As well as we're doing,
we want to do better.

779
00:57:40,733 --> 00:57:44,102
The bottom line after all is... money.

780
00:57:46,072 --> 00:57:47,649
I'd like to propose a toast.

781
00:57:50,075 --> 00:57:54,784
To international business, good
commercial relations between all countries,

782
00:57:54,913 --> 00:57:58,080
and to the healthy future
of high quality foods

783
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:02,419
thanks to Sakamoto Enterprises and
to Bentley Advertising!

784
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:03,577
Hear, hear!

785
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:09,257
A toast to competitiveness,
good management,

786
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:11,710
profit and honesty.

787
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:16,846
- Spencer, do a toast.
- Sure.

788
00:58:18,185 --> 00:58:20,059
A toast...

789
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:25,515
To the cubs winning the World series
and big tits.

790
00:58:34,409 --> 00:58:38,193
I'm sure you're familiar
with our last campaign.

791
00:58:39,455 --> 00:58:40,486
Yes...

792
00:58:41,123 --> 00:58:43,081
high quality Foods
The best there is

793
00:58:43,209 --> 00:58:45,201
I watch TV all the time.

794
00:58:45,336 --> 00:58:49,464
We've been using that for years.
We are looking for a new image.

795
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:53,006
And we love what Bentley did
for Kerry's cookies.

796
00:58:53,135 --> 00:58:55,423
Honesty is the key to success.

797
00:58:55,554 --> 00:58:58,389
I want an honest campaign.

798
00:58:58,515 --> 00:59:00,638
Honesty? That's good.

799
00:59:01,476 --> 00:59:04,346
Are you familiar
with high quality's products?

800
00:59:04,479 --> 00:59:06,222
I eat the stuff every day.

801
00:59:06,356 --> 00:59:08,562
- What is your opinion?
- Honestly?

802
00:59:10,234 --> 00:59:12,690
I think your oatmeal sucks.
Nobody likes it.

803
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:15,856
It tastes like dirt.
Chewy dirt.

804
00:59:16,699 --> 00:59:18,987
Your bologna tastes like rubber.

805
00:59:19,118 --> 00:59:21,436
You have to smother it with mustard,
so you don't taste it.

806
00:59:21,537 --> 00:59:26,079
But not your mustard
'cause your mustard tastes like shit.

807
00:59:26,208 --> 00:59:30,205
Your frosted flakes have half the sugar
that Tony the Tiger's does.

808
00:59:30,337 --> 00:59:31,914
And your bread just rips apart.

809
00:59:32,046 --> 00:59:34,964
Just try spreading peanut butter
on it... right in your hands.

810
00:59:35,091 --> 00:59:37,214
Not your peanut butter 'cause it sucks.

811
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:40,297
I don't think this is a good idea.

812
00:59:40,429 --> 00:59:42,137
- He asked me.
- Ms Connors...

813
00:59:42,264 --> 00:59:44,423
what do you think about what he's saying?

814
00:59:44,558 --> 00:59:49,101
It's outrageous. If this is your idea
of a joke, I don't find it funny.

815
00:59:49,229 --> 00:59:51,269
No, I'm just being honest.

816
00:59:51,398 --> 00:59:55,561
- You've been honest enough.
- No, please. Go on.

817
00:59:55,694 --> 00:59:58,979
Is there anything
about high quality foods you like?

818
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,818
Your potato chips are pretty good,
but then again I like greasy food.

819
01:00:06,162 --> 01:00:08,238
It's not bad that you sell cheap stuff.

820
01:00:08,372 --> 01:00:11,326
Not everybody can afford
a o3.00 box of fruit Loops.

821
01:00:11,459 --> 01:00:14,329
But you shouldn't call it
high quality foods, 'cause it isn't.

822
01:00:14,461 --> 01:00:19,123
Big Sak, if you want to be honest,
you should call it Low quality foods.

823
01:00:19,258 --> 01:00:21,546
But you don't want to do that...

824
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:26,305
Why don't you try calling it
something like Affordable foods.

825
01:00:26,431 --> 01:00:29,385
Or change the "best there is" thing to,

826
01:00:29,517 --> 01:00:33,266
"high quality food
because you can afford it."

827
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:36,812
Or make your food really great,
then you can say,

828
01:00:36,941 --> 01:00:41,235
"Eat this because everybody
deserves high quality foods."

829
01:00:41,362 --> 01:00:44,777
how dare you insult our product.

830
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:49,153
Mr. Sakamoto, I am so sorry.
This is ridiculous.

831
01:00:49,286 --> 01:00:51,777
I've never seen anything
so unprofessional.

832
01:00:51,913 --> 01:00:56,575
Well, maybe I'm just not good
at these kinds of meetings.

833
01:00:56,710 --> 01:00:58,453
All right?

834
01:00:59,837 --> 01:01:02,245
I got a hot date.
I'm out of here.

835
01:01:03,216 --> 01:01:04,461
Nice tits.

836
01:01:07,595 --> 01:01:10,714
I'm out of here also.
Nice chi-chi.

837
01:01:11,765 --> 01:01:13,888
I've got the nurses' station.

838
01:01:14,017 --> 01:01:17,102
Get me Walter Bentley on the phone now!

839
01:01:37,665 --> 01:01:39,040
BMW.

840
01:01:40,459 --> 01:01:41,834
Mercedes.

841
01:01:43,378 --> 01:01:44,541
Jaguar.

842
01:01:46,465 --> 01:01:48,125
Hey, Chico!

843
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:50,960
Take care of her.

844
01:01:56,141 --> 01:01:59,058
Yeah.
I'll take care of her.

845
01:01:59,185 --> 01:02:02,102
I haven't robbed anyone.
I've been robbed.

846
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:04,436
Look at me.
Do you think I dress this way?

847
01:02:04,565 --> 01:02:06,688
- I'm an executive.
- 383.

848
01:02:06,817 --> 01:02:10,268
I'd sue for false arrest, but I'd
probably end up in the electric chair.

849
01:02:10,404 --> 01:02:11,863
One comb.

850
01:02:11,989 --> 01:02:14,693
- Listen, I need a ride.
- Shoelaces.

851
01:02:14,825 --> 01:02:18,407
Hello. Earth to Little Abner.
I need a ride.

852
01:02:18,537 --> 01:02:21,703
- We're not a taxi service.
- One piece of paper.

853
01:02:25,251 --> 01:02:27,374
Oh, God.

854
01:02:27,503 --> 01:02:30,504
God, Debbie, I'm so sorry.

855
01:02:30,631 --> 01:02:33,466
Don't be silly.
It was good to hear your voice again.

856
01:02:33,592 --> 01:02:37,210
I got to cancel my credit cards,
I got to call high quality foods.

857
01:02:37,346 --> 01:02:41,260
I got to call Elizabeth.
I need to go back to Walter's in Malibu.

858
01:02:41,391 --> 01:02:44,013
- Please take me there.
- First, I'm making us dinner.

859
01:02:44,144 --> 01:02:46,350
No! I have to get back there right now.

860
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,271
Spencer!

861
01:02:51,818 --> 01:02:55,436
I am not moving until you say yes.

862
01:03:00,034 --> 01:03:01,991
Yes!

863
01:03:07,082 --> 01:03:11,411
So, then... Mitch tells me he's married.

864
01:03:15,465 --> 01:03:18,170
Obviously, he was not the man for me.

865
01:03:18,301 --> 01:03:20,092
No way.

866
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:23,304
He thought he could control me.

867
01:03:23,431 --> 01:03:26,764
I felt like...
like I was in prison.

868
01:03:28,144 --> 01:03:30,979
- Man, I know that feeling.
- Yeah?

869
01:03:31,105 --> 01:03:33,856
Trapped, lonely.

870
01:03:33,983 --> 01:03:36,308
Frustrated. You're stuck inside.

871
01:03:36,443 --> 01:03:40,026
You don't know how you got there,
but you're there.

872
01:03:40,155 --> 01:03:41,483
Yeah.

873
01:03:41,615 --> 01:03:44,651
I was in a relationship like that recently.

874
01:03:44,784 --> 01:03:47,454
It lasted about three years.

875
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:51,493
Controlled by one person,
who could be so cruel.

876
01:03:51,624 --> 01:03:53,202
Exactly!

877
01:03:53,334 --> 01:03:57,035
All you want to do is experience
the things you can't reach.

878
01:03:57,171 --> 01:04:01,999
Like a baseball game or a...
a dinner with a pretty girl.

879
01:04:08,557 --> 01:04:11,890
I'm... shy.

880
01:04:12,894 --> 01:04:16,512
- You wouldn't know it.
- Somehow, l...

881
01:04:16,648 --> 01:04:18,724
I feel free.

882
01:04:18,858 --> 01:04:22,441
I feel... open.

883
01:04:24,989 --> 01:04:26,483
I feel sexy.

884
01:04:27,325 --> 01:04:29,780
Check!

885
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:31,535
Check, please.

886
01:04:31,662 --> 01:04:35,660
As we await the sixth and
possibly final game of the World series,

887
01:04:35,791 --> 01:04:39,623
unless authorities decide
to forcibly remove the inmates

888
01:04:39,753 --> 01:04:41,496
from their barricaded prison cells,

889
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:44,963
tomorrow while you're sitting at home
watching the game...

890
01:04:45,091 --> 01:04:48,175
These pants fit before
my cauliflower and radish diet.

891
01:04:48,303 --> 01:04:50,972
- Thanks a lot.
- I was a fashion disaster.

892
01:04:51,097 --> 01:04:54,929
I'd lost 70 pounds.
Gained back 20, lost 10.

893
01:04:55,059 --> 01:04:58,973
I used to be on an avocado diet
before I found out they were fattening.

894
01:04:59,105 --> 01:05:03,813
Did you know that?
You see them in health food stores.

895
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:08,937
You never think of them as bad for you,
but they're very fattening.

896
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:12,275
Then I started working
as a beauty consultant.

897
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:19,453
You're so tense.
Take a deep breath.

898
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,907
Come on, take a real deep breath.

899
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:25,577
Isn't that good? feel better?

900
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:28,583
It's amazing what a little bit
of make-up can do.

901
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:31,716
It can make anybody look beautiful.

902
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:34,335
Guess I'm a people person.

903
01:05:34,471 --> 01:05:35,799
It's the oven.

904
01:05:38,266 --> 01:05:40,058
Stay.

905
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:48,523
Damn it, Elizabeth.
Where are you?

906
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:22,383
I hope you don't feel uncomfortable,
my being Walter's daughter.

907
01:06:22,516 --> 01:06:27,807
No... no. no.

908
01:06:32,985 --> 01:06:34,479
Good.

909
01:07:23,782 --> 01:07:25,158
What?

910
01:07:28,871 --> 01:07:30,910
Well...

911
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:36,579
You're the first man I've gone out with
that hasn't tried to jump on me.

912
01:07:36,711 --> 01:07:38,668
I am?

913
01:07:57,689 --> 01:07:59,646
Where is everybody?

914
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:07,312
A little burned but edible, I think.

915
01:08:11,244 --> 01:08:14,778
We can't put the phone down
for a minute, can we?

916
01:08:21,629 --> 01:08:23,586
- What?
- You should get that.

917
01:08:23,714 --> 01:08:25,588
It could be my father.

918
01:08:25,716 --> 01:08:28,752
- Your father! Where?
- No, the phone.

919
01:08:31,096 --> 01:08:33,800
The phone.

920
01:08:33,932 --> 01:08:34,931
Hello?

921
01:08:35,058 --> 01:08:36,801
Hello, who's this?

922
01:08:36,935 --> 01:08:40,101
- Who do you want to speak to?
- Spencer.

923
01:08:41,481 --> 01:08:43,307
- This is Spencer.
- Spencer who?

924
01:08:43,441 --> 01:08:44,639
Who am I speaking to?

925
01:08:46,068 --> 01:08:47,562
He's there.

926
01:08:47,695 --> 01:08:49,937
I need you to drive me to Walter's.

927
01:08:50,072 --> 01:08:53,488
- You'll feel better after you've eaten.
- He's there!

928
01:08:53,617 --> 01:08:58,078
But we were just starting
to get funky.

929
01:08:58,205 --> 01:09:01,241
- I need you to drive me right away.
- How about after dinner?

930
01:09:01,374 --> 01:09:05,324
- No, I've got to go immediately.
- Oh, Spencer!

931
01:09:05,462 --> 01:09:09,245
You know, all you've done
since I met you is complain.

932
01:09:09,382 --> 01:09:12,798
I can't take it anymore.

933
01:09:12,927 --> 01:09:16,711
I've been your chauffeur and your cook.

934
01:09:16,847 --> 01:09:19,136
- And your shrink!
- Debbie, really...

935
01:09:19,266 --> 01:09:22,101
I don't know what's happened to you
since high school,

936
01:09:22,227 --> 01:09:26,141
but you've become
this selfish, materialistic creep.

937
01:09:26,273 --> 01:09:28,515
- I need a ride.
- Get out!

938
01:09:28,650 --> 01:09:31,105
- What?
- Get out!

939
01:09:31,236 --> 01:09:35,103
I never want to see you again! Get out!

940
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:39,486
And after you've dry cleaned those pants,
I want them back!

941
01:09:39,619 --> 01:09:41,611
Perma-press!

942
01:09:41,746 --> 01:09:43,952
Oh, my God.

943
01:09:50,754 --> 01:09:53,292
- It's raining.
- Yeah.

944
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:56,877
Well...

945
01:09:57,010 --> 01:10:00,177
- I guess...
- I had a fabulous time.

946
01:10:00,305 --> 01:10:03,140
Best safe sex I've ever had.

947
01:10:03,266 --> 01:10:06,717
I had a fabulous time too.
I haven't had that much fun...

948
01:10:06,853 --> 01:10:11,598
in two years, eleven months,
three weeks and five days.

949
01:10:15,069 --> 01:10:18,853
I would stay but I feel uncomfortable
sleeping in my dad's bed.

950
01:10:18,989 --> 01:10:20,697
I don't.

951
01:10:22,993 --> 01:10:25,863
He's got so many pillows.

952
01:10:25,996 --> 01:10:29,827
- Are you sure I can take your rolls?
- Yeah, it's just a loaner.

953
01:10:31,292 --> 01:10:33,962
I guess I better...

954
01:10:44,763 --> 01:10:46,388
Wait!

955
01:10:49,476 --> 01:10:54,019
You think you'd like to go to the
World series with me tomorrow, maybe?

956
01:10:54,147 --> 01:10:56,519
I'd love to!

957
01:10:56,650 --> 01:10:59,567
- You want to go?
- I'd love to go.

958
01:10:59,694 --> 01:11:01,603
That's great.

959
01:11:01,738 --> 01:11:04,026
I think...

960
01:11:04,157 --> 01:11:06,861
I think I'm getting wet.

961
01:11:06,993 --> 01:11:11,286
- You better go inside.
- I'll meet you here about 12:00?

962
01:11:11,414 --> 01:11:14,201
12:00. park it around here, all right?

963
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:17,417
- You come here.
- Ok.

964
01:11:25,635 --> 01:11:27,295
Yeah!

965
01:12:01,169 --> 01:12:02,627
Spencer?

966
01:12:05,548 --> 01:12:06,923
Spencer!

967
01:12:07,049 --> 01:12:10,963
I'll kill you!

968
01:12:12,137 --> 01:12:15,969
What the hell's the matter with you?
I was doing you a favour.

969
01:12:16,099 --> 01:12:18,175
I busted my ass for you.

970
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:20,931
- All because of this little thing.
- Give me that!

971
01:12:21,062 --> 01:12:24,063
Take it. Just give me my reward
and I'm out of here.

972
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:28,140
Reward? Are you crazy? I should
sue you for everything you've got!

973
01:12:28,278 --> 01:12:30,685
I'd like to see that.
I got nothing.

974
01:12:30,822 --> 01:12:32,102
Excuse me.

975
01:12:33,074 --> 01:12:37,320
- Hello?
- Hello, Spencer? It's me, Ted.

976
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:40,537
It's for you.

977
01:12:40,664 --> 01:12:42,491
- Hello?
- Spencer?

978
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:44,700
- Yes?
- It's Ted.

979
01:12:44,835 --> 01:12:46,377
Hi, Ted.

980
01:12:46,503 --> 01:12:51,129
I'm sure it's no surprise to you but Diane's
officially turned down your agency.

981
01:12:51,258 --> 01:12:54,258
- What?
- Mike and I are sorry it didn't work out.

982
01:12:54,386 --> 01:12:57,386
- We really liked you.
- Get me Diane!

983
01:12:57,513 --> 01:13:00,965
Well, after that meeting
she won't take your calls, ever.

984
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:02,428
Damn it!

985
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,683
You said you were me.

986
01:13:05,396 --> 01:13:08,231
You beat Sakamoto at tennis.

987
01:13:08,357 --> 01:13:11,144
You blew it with Diane Connors!

988
01:13:11,276 --> 01:13:15,226
- That chick's a witch.
- I'll kill you!

989
01:13:17,866 --> 01:13:20,072
You look like shit.

990
01:13:20,201 --> 01:13:21,482
That hurt.

991
01:13:21,619 --> 01:13:25,284
- I didn't lose your Filofax, you did.
- I'll kill you!

992
01:13:28,626 --> 01:13:31,164
Now just calm down.

993
01:13:33,089 --> 01:13:36,374
- You ruined my life.
- I've been looking after you.

994
01:13:36,509 --> 01:13:38,916
And you keep yelling at me.

995
01:13:39,053 --> 01:13:42,836
Just give me my World series tickets
back and I'm out of here.

996
01:13:42,973 --> 01:13:44,515
World series tickets?

997
01:13:44,641 --> 01:13:47,262
Yeah, they're in your book.

998
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:50,928
Give me my tickets, man.

999
01:13:51,064 --> 01:13:53,815
- These are the tickets?
- Yes.

1000
01:13:53,942 --> 01:13:56,183
- You must be a big baseball fan.
- I am.

1001
01:13:56,319 --> 01:13:59,770
Can't wait to go to the World series.
Listen to me.

1002
01:13:59,906 --> 01:14:03,274
You're coming with me and telling
everyone who you are and who I am.

1003
01:14:03,409 --> 01:14:05,318
I'd really like to help you out.

1004
01:14:05,452 --> 01:14:09,284
I've got a date with this beautiful girl
I'm taking to the World series.

1005
01:14:09,415 --> 01:14:12,285
I don't think so!

1006
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:16,294
Don't bite the seat number.

1007
01:14:18,506 --> 01:14:22,374
Follow me.
I can taste the excitement.

1008
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:25,001
Stop biting my tickets, all right?

1009
01:14:25,138 --> 01:14:27,177
All right.

1010
01:14:27,306 --> 01:14:31,174
This is a Lotus.
You know what this thing does?

1011
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:34,928
This thing goes 160 miles an hour.
Over that.

1012
01:14:35,064 --> 01:14:37,140
This is a nice set of wheels.

1013
01:14:37,274 --> 01:14:39,646
Great, no keys.

1014
01:14:39,776 --> 01:14:41,935
Who needs keys?

1015
01:14:54,707 --> 01:14:58,787
Where can I get a pair of pants like that?
They come in different colours?

1016
01:14:58,919 --> 01:15:02,122
Hope this doesn't take long.
Can't miss the national anthem.

1017
01:15:02,256 --> 01:15:03,667
Shut up.

1018
01:15:04,174 --> 01:15:05,585
Second floor.

1019
01:15:05,718 --> 01:15:10,842
- Who are you, anyway?
- Fourth floor, fifth floor.

1020
01:15:10,972 --> 01:15:13,510
- I'm a car thief.
- Very funny.

1021
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:16,179
No, really. I'm an escaped convict.

1022
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:21,767
I broke out of prison to see the cubs
in the World series.

1023
01:15:21,899 --> 01:15:24,569
- I'm serious.
- Shut up.

1024
01:15:24,694 --> 01:15:26,733
Lovely.

1025
01:15:26,862 --> 01:15:30,527
Sakamoto will be here any moment.
No unsolicited comments...

1026
01:15:30,658 --> 01:15:32,864
- Diane Connors?
- That's her.

1027
01:15:32,993 --> 01:15:35,116
- What are you doing here?
- Watch it, she bites.

1028
01:15:35,245 --> 01:15:37,736
What the hell's going on?
Didn't you get the message

1029
01:15:37,873 --> 01:15:40,624
that we are not interested
in you or your agency?

1030
01:15:40,751 --> 01:15:43,123
Tell her who you are.

1031
01:15:43,253 --> 01:15:45,459
I'm Jimmy.

1032
01:15:45,588 --> 01:15:47,960
Walter Bentley's on teleconference.

1033
01:15:48,091 --> 01:15:52,587
Put him through.
I'm curious to hear what he has to say.

1034
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:55,674
Good. I can explain everything.

1035
01:15:57,975 --> 01:16:00,466
Hello, Diane. You're looking good.

1036
01:16:00,603 --> 01:16:04,102
Look, I want to apologise for...
Spencer!

1037
01:16:04,231 --> 01:16:06,140
Walter, thank God.

1038
01:16:06,275 --> 01:16:09,857
What the hell are you doing there?
You look awful.

1039
01:16:09,986 --> 01:16:13,569
Like a bum at a costume party.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1040
01:16:13,698 --> 01:16:15,027
Like he looks great.

1041
01:16:15,158 --> 01:16:18,823
How the hell could you come up
with this honey nut bakery slogan?

1042
01:16:18,953 --> 01:16:23,414
They've already printed the billboards.
"Check out those buns."

1043
01:16:23,541 --> 01:16:25,118
What buns?

1044
01:16:25,251 --> 01:16:28,168
- These buns!
- I like that.

1045
01:16:28,295 --> 01:16:31,996
I don't think your corporate and
personal problems are our concern.

1046
01:16:32,132 --> 01:16:35,667
You have screwed up
in every possible way.

1047
01:16:35,802 --> 01:16:38,472
Walter, it wasn't me.

1048
01:16:38,597 --> 01:16:40,470
That's not Spencer, Walter.

1049
01:16:40,599 --> 01:16:42,887
I'm disappointed in you.

1050
01:16:43,018 --> 01:16:44,262
What's happening?

1051
01:16:44,394 --> 01:16:45,971
Beats the hell out of me.

1052
01:16:46,104 --> 01:16:49,686
If you think that you are getting
that promotion, forget it.

1053
01:16:49,816 --> 01:16:53,516
You failed... totally!

1054
01:16:53,653 --> 01:16:59,821
Hey, all he did was lose his book.
I'm the one that screwed up.

1055
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:01,777
- Who's this guy?
- I'm Jimmy.

1056
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:06,572
It's true. All you do is talk.
Push people around.

1057
01:17:06,706 --> 01:17:09,162
You know what? It really pisses us off.

1058
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:13,705
Spencer, I want you back here in 12 hours.

1059
01:17:13,838 --> 01:17:16,709
- This is a mistake.
- Listen to me.

1060
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:19,296
You're the mistake.

1061
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:23,178
I'm the mistake.

1062
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:26,556
In the last two days,
I've been mugged.

1063
01:17:26,684 --> 01:17:32,638
I've been thrown into garbage,
I've been put in jail, my wife has left me.

1064
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:36,355
All because of this account.
I've been obsessed.

1065
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:41,312
The same way I've been obsessed
with every account I've gotten for you.

1066
01:17:41,448 --> 01:17:45,527
- All I do is work.
- Work! Weekends, holidays.

1067
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:48,863
When I'm not working...

1068
01:17:48,996 --> 01:17:54,536
I don't know who I am.
I don't know what to do or think.

1069
01:17:56,629 --> 01:18:01,041
- I hate my life.
- Lt stinks.

1070
01:18:01,174 --> 01:18:05,219
I've made my wife miserable,
I've made myself miserable.

1071
01:18:06,346 --> 01:18:11,173
I don't want to end up like you.
I really...

1072
01:18:11,309 --> 01:18:14,429
I can't do this anymore.

1073
01:18:14,562 --> 01:18:17,895
The hell with all of it. I quit.

1074
01:18:20,943 --> 01:18:24,857
Yeah... me, too.

1075
01:18:24,989 --> 01:18:28,357
I quit. I'll see you later sometime.

1076
01:18:28,492 --> 01:18:31,825
Big Sak. Work on your game.

1077
01:18:31,953 --> 01:18:34,444
Don't lose that broom, witch.

1078
01:18:35,916 --> 01:18:37,575
I want to apologise...

1079
01:18:37,709 --> 01:18:40,496
Your firm has exhibited
gross incompetency.

1080
01:18:40,628 --> 01:18:44,293
I am taking you out of my Filofax.

1081
01:18:44,424 --> 01:18:45,668
Don't!

1082
01:18:47,802 --> 01:18:51,882
Mr. Sakamoto.
Bentley isn't the only agency.

1083
01:18:52,014 --> 01:18:55,181
I never had a good feeling
about them anyway.

1084
01:18:55,309 --> 01:18:58,642
- Get me the Bellflower August agency.
- No need.

1085
01:18:58,770 --> 01:19:01,095
Unless you're looking for a job.

1086
01:19:01,231 --> 01:19:04,018
I'm not looking...
What?

1087
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:09,489
I came to the united states not just
to approve a new ad campaign,

1088
01:19:09,614 --> 01:19:12,817
but to see you in action.
I've had complaints.

1089
01:19:14,368 --> 01:19:16,278
What exactly are you saying?

1090
01:19:16,412 --> 01:19:21,287
What I'm saying exactly, ms Connors,
is that you are unprofessional,

1091
01:19:21,417 --> 01:19:25,995
rude, and clearly incapable
of running my company.

1092
01:19:26,129 --> 01:19:30,079
And what I am saying
is that you are terminated.

1093
01:19:30,217 --> 01:19:32,505
Yay!

1094
01:19:35,096 --> 01:19:39,509
Spencer, game time.

1095
01:19:41,853 --> 01:19:43,513
Spencer?

1096
01:19:53,405 --> 01:19:54,780
Yo, Spencer.

1097
01:19:57,492 --> 01:20:00,695
Spencer, you forgot this.

1098
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:05,040
- You were great back there.
- Great! I have nothing.

1099
01:20:05,583 --> 01:20:07,540
You have your book.

1100
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:10,124
Shut up, leave me alone.

1101
01:20:10,254 --> 01:20:12,461
Ah, baby, baby, baby,
with the shut up.

1102
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:16,124
If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't
realise your life was so rotten.

1103
01:20:21,265 --> 01:20:24,301
- You want to go to the game?
- No.

1104
01:20:24,434 --> 01:20:27,139
Come on, what are you going to do?

1105
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:29,844
You don't have to be at work tomorrow.

1106
01:20:33,651 --> 01:20:35,478
That's true.

1107
01:20:36,404 --> 01:20:38,443
Wait, don't move.

1108
01:20:40,658 --> 01:20:44,702
Hey, come on. Let's kick some butt.

1109
01:20:44,829 --> 01:20:48,197
- You can use a little fun.
- Fun?

1110
01:20:48,332 --> 01:20:52,709
- My life is over.
- No, it's not. It's just beginning.

1111
01:20:52,836 --> 01:20:54,164
Cubbies.

1112
01:20:54,296 --> 01:20:58,128
It's the Chicago cubs. Did you know
you and I are both from Chicago?

1113
01:20:58,258 --> 01:21:00,963
- Now that's exciting.
- Lt is exciting.

1114
01:21:01,094 --> 01:21:04,297
It's a statistic. It's a coincidence.

1115
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:07,550
It's a divine right that
you and I should be here together,

1116
01:21:07,683 --> 01:21:09,427
while the cubs are in the World series.

1117
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:14,352
We have to be at the cubs.
They need us.

1118
01:21:16,984 --> 01:21:20,768
One leg over the other.
Come on and there we go!

1119
01:21:20,904 --> 01:21:23,395
That easy. come on, let's go.

1120
01:21:26,326 --> 01:21:28,817
You really are an escaped convict.

1121
01:21:28,954 --> 01:21:32,287
Yes, sir. 37 counts of Grand Theft Auto.

1122
01:21:33,082 --> 01:21:36,665
And you really did break out of prison
to go to the World series.

1123
01:21:36,794 --> 01:21:39,285
Yeah.

1124
01:21:39,422 --> 01:21:44,760
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

1125
01:21:45,886 --> 01:21:47,879
You want to hear dumb?

1126
01:21:48,013 --> 01:21:51,713
I'm about to break a date with the most
beautiful girl I've seen in 5 years.

1127
01:21:52,559 --> 01:21:54,598
That's dumb, Spencer Barnes.

1128
01:21:54,728 --> 01:21:57,978
It's all because of you 'cause
we're going to the cubs game.

1129
01:21:58,106 --> 01:22:03,266
In the car. hot dogs, hamburgers,
cokes, popcorn.

1130
01:22:03,403 --> 01:22:04,565
Cotton candy.

1131
01:22:04,696 --> 01:22:09,737
Get in there. All right.
Spence, you tight ass.

1132
01:22:09,867 --> 01:22:11,491
Way to go.

1133
01:22:18,584 --> 01:22:21,335
- Hello.
- Jewel, it's me.

1134
01:22:21,461 --> 01:22:24,083
Spencer! Where are you? Are you okay?

1135
01:22:24,214 --> 01:22:28,081
Listen, I'm really sorry,
but I have to cancel our date.

1136
01:22:28,218 --> 01:22:31,254
I need to spend some time with a friend.

1137
01:22:31,387 --> 01:22:35,930
God, Spencer.
You're so sensitive.

1138
01:22:36,058 --> 01:22:38,728
What are you doing tonight?
Are you busy?

1139
01:22:38,853 --> 01:22:43,016
I got some plans for tonight,
but I'm free tomorrow.

1140
01:22:43,148 --> 01:22:44,726
Tomorrow's fine.

1141
01:22:59,706 --> 01:23:01,200
Is Spencer Barnes here?

1142
01:23:01,332 --> 01:23:04,867
No, I'm afraid he's not here right now.
Can I help you?

1143
01:23:05,002 --> 01:23:07,042
I'm not sure.

1144
01:23:08,339 --> 01:23:09,501
You are?

1145
01:23:09,632 --> 01:23:11,209
I'm his wife.

1146
01:23:11,342 --> 01:23:13,133
His what?

1147
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:16,960
O'er the ramparts we watched

1148
01:23:17,097 --> 01:23:20,762
Were so gallantly streaming

1149
01:23:20,892 --> 01:23:25,139
And the rockets red glare

1150
01:23:25,271 --> 01:23:28,806
The bombs bursting in air

1151
01:23:28,942 --> 01:23:32,642
gave proof through the night

1152
01:23:32,778 --> 01:23:37,156
That our flag was still there

1153
01:23:37,283 --> 01:23:42,490
Oh, say does that star-spangled

1154
01:23:42,621 --> 01:23:49,157
Banner yet wave

1155
01:23:49,294 --> 01:23:56,257
O'er the land of the free

1156
01:23:56,384 --> 01:24:04,130
And the home of the brave

1157
01:24:06,477 --> 01:24:09,146
Go cubs! kick some ass!

1158
01:24:09,271 --> 01:24:12,722
Let's go. here's your hat. Let's go!

1159
01:24:18,446 --> 01:24:19,857
Play ball!

1160
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:21,816
All right! play ball.

1161
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:25,034
Then he took me downtown.
We went to a blues club...

1162
01:24:25,161 --> 01:24:27,367
- blues club?
- Then we came back here...

1163
01:24:27,497 --> 01:24:29,406
Spencer hates blues.

1164
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:33,324
What do you mean? We had...

1165
01:24:33,461 --> 01:24:37,588
The guy you're describing sounds like
a totally different person.

1166
01:24:39,425 --> 01:24:41,547
To be honest,
you don't look like

1167
01:24:41,677 --> 01:24:44,464
the kind of woman that would be married
to a man with a tattoo.

1168
01:24:44,596 --> 01:24:46,423
A what?

1169
01:24:51,061 --> 01:24:52,175
Hello.

1170
01:24:52,312 --> 01:24:53,889
Hello, is Spencer there?

1171
01:24:54,022 --> 01:24:56,857
No, Spencer's not here.
Who is this?

1172
01:24:56,983 --> 01:24:57,982
It's Debbie.

1173
01:24:58,067 --> 01:25:01,732
Let me have it. Who's Debbie? Debbie?

1174
01:25:01,862 --> 01:25:03,143
What do you want?

1175
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:09,733
Tell Spencer I'm sorry about last night
and I shouldn't have kicked him out.

1176
01:25:09,870 --> 01:25:11,661
Tell him he can keep the pants.

1177
01:25:11,788 --> 01:25:13,911
- What?
- What?

1178
01:25:14,958 --> 01:25:18,742
Come on, get your World series
souvenirs here.

1179
01:25:23,883 --> 01:25:27,169
Here, got you a coke and a dog.

1180
01:25:27,303 --> 01:25:31,514
- Thanks.
- Man, I love this game.

1181
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:34,214
What's wrong with you?

1182
01:25:34,351 --> 01:25:39,690
Nothing. I screwed up with everything.
I never got what I wanted.

1183
01:25:40,774 --> 01:25:42,980
What did you want?

1184
01:25:45,529 --> 01:25:47,687
I don't know.
You know what you want?

1185
01:25:49,491 --> 01:25:52,942
I want the cubs to win the World series!

1186
01:25:53,077 --> 01:25:54,192
Nice hit.

1187
01:25:54,328 --> 01:25:57,946
You better leave now.
You don't want to get stuck in traffic.

1188
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:05,210
What happened with your wife?

1189
01:26:05,339 --> 01:26:07,960
You get caught cheating?
You banging the babysitter?

1190
01:26:08,091 --> 01:26:10,926
- We don't even have any kids.
- How come?

1191
01:26:12,888 --> 01:26:16,837
I never thought there'd be enough time
to raise them right.

1192
01:26:16,975 --> 01:26:19,644
You got plenty of time now.

1193
01:26:24,690 --> 01:26:28,059
Call her. Give me that.

1194
01:26:28,194 --> 01:26:31,645
Go ahead, call her.
She probably misses you.

1195
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:35,445
My wife thinks I'm a single-minded,
obsessive jerk.

1196
01:26:35,576 --> 01:26:37,901
You are a single-minded, obsessive jerk.

1197
01:26:38,036 --> 01:26:42,164
- You don't have to be if you don't want to.
- You sure?

1198
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:44,532
No, I'm not sure.

1199
01:26:44,668 --> 01:26:48,535
- That's my dad's phone.
- He's a scout. he's calling the bullpen.

1200
01:27:22,036 --> 01:27:23,035
What a play!

1201
01:27:23,079 --> 01:27:24,787
Did you see that?

1202
01:27:32,087 --> 01:27:34,756
- Let's get that guy for an interview.
- Ok.

1203
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:39,336
I got it! Did you see that?

1204
01:27:39,469 --> 01:27:42,553
I just reached out, I snagged it.
The home run ball.

1205
01:27:42,681 --> 01:27:44,803
Mark Grace and the cubs
in the World series.

1206
01:27:44,933 --> 01:27:48,467
Did you see that spectacular catch?

1207
01:27:48,603 --> 01:27:51,769
You didn't see it? Why?

1208
01:27:51,898 --> 01:27:54,305
- I was on the phone.
- You should've seen it.

1209
01:27:54,442 --> 01:27:58,190
I was reaching out there and grabbed it.
It was the catch of the day.

1210
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:02,400
- You told me to call home.
- You could have waited, put them on hold.

1211
01:28:02,533 --> 01:28:05,450
- It was a great catch!
- Elizabeth wasn't there.

1212
01:28:05,577 --> 01:28:10,155
She wasn't there?
She didn't see it either.

1213
01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:13,493
Elizabeth is your wife?
She called for you yesterday.

1214
01:28:13,626 --> 01:28:15,251
She called yesterday?

1215
01:28:15,378 --> 01:28:19,292
- Did she say anything?
- She apologized for kicking him out.

1216
01:28:19,423 --> 01:28:23,291
For kicking him out last night?
I was with him. That can't be right.

1217
01:28:23,427 --> 01:28:26,463
- What's she talking about?
- This isn't getting easier.

1218
01:28:26,597 --> 01:28:29,681
My God! Look, it's Spencer.

1219
01:28:29,808 --> 01:28:32,844
- That's not Spencer.
- Of course it's Spencer.

1220
01:28:32,978 --> 01:28:35,385
What's he doing on television?

1221
01:28:35,522 --> 01:28:38,772
That's not Spencer. That's Spencer.

1222
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:41,936
That? That's not Spencer.

1223
01:28:42,070 --> 01:28:44,442
- Where did he get that shirt?
- What?

1224
01:28:44,572 --> 01:28:47,941
My Elizabeth called yesterday?
What did she say?

1225
01:28:50,995 --> 01:28:53,700
- They must have seen me on TV.
- What did she say?

1226
01:28:55,791 --> 01:28:57,997
I gotta go. It was fun being you.

1227
01:28:58,127 --> 01:29:00,499
What did she say? Wait a minute!

1228
01:29:00,629 --> 01:29:02,456
Excuse me.

1229
01:29:04,257 --> 01:29:06,001
Wait a minute!

1230
01:29:13,349 --> 01:29:17,050
What's happening?
Why are we doing this?

1231
01:29:17,186 --> 01:29:20,389
The cops.
They must have seen me on TV.

1232
01:29:20,523 --> 01:29:24,354
- When were you on TV?
- When I made that catch you missed.

1233
01:29:26,153 --> 01:29:29,356
- The cops wouldn't shoot us, would they?
- I don't think so.

1234
01:29:29,489 --> 01:29:33,357
You don't think so?
What did Elizabeth say?

1235
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:35,984
- I'm missing the game!
- What did she say?

1236
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:39,324
- What?
- Shit! What are you following me for?

1237
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:42,292
If we get busted,
you'll get in trouble. Leave!

1238
01:29:42,418 --> 01:29:45,372
I can't get arrested running
with an escaped con, can I?

1239
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:47,580
Maybe.

1240
01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:50,713
He's not down there.
He's probably up the ramp.

1241
01:29:50,843 --> 01:29:54,461
Did Elizabeth say
to tell me anything?

1242
01:29:54,596 --> 01:29:57,633
- Where did she call from?
- I didn't talk to her.

1243
01:29:57,766 --> 01:30:00,850
- You didn't talk to her?
- Don't pitch to him, walk him!

1244
01:30:00,977 --> 01:30:02,887
He got a hit.
The Angels are going to score.

1245
01:30:03,021 --> 01:30:05,393
- Who talked to her?
- Jewel talked to her.

1246
01:30:05,523 --> 01:30:07,350
Walter's Jewel?

1247
01:30:07,484 --> 01:30:10,188
She's one hot lady.
Last night we did it.

1248
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,695
Come on.

1249
01:30:11,821 --> 01:30:15,237
You mean I slept with Walter's daughter?

1250
01:30:15,366 --> 01:30:18,486
How was I?

1251
01:30:18,619 --> 01:30:21,240
You were great!

1252
01:30:21,372 --> 01:30:23,945
I knew I could be great in bed.

1253
01:30:25,167 --> 01:30:26,246
That's him!

1254
01:30:26,376 --> 01:30:29,211
- Let's get out of here.
- Guys, stop!

1255
01:30:29,337 --> 01:30:31,626
Come back, damn it!

1256
01:30:35,176 --> 01:30:37,963
You got a credit card?
Give it to me.

1257
01:30:42,225 --> 01:30:44,016
Sweet.

1258
01:30:58,115 --> 01:31:00,605
Damn it.

1259
01:31:00,742 --> 01:31:02,201
Shit!

1260
01:31:02,952 --> 01:31:06,617
I can't... I can't believe it.

1261
01:31:07,790 --> 01:31:11,870
I can escape out of jail, but I can't
escape out of a damn ballpark.

1262
01:31:13,588 --> 01:31:16,672
I guess I'll just go back
to jail, that's all.

1263
01:31:16,799 --> 01:31:19,087
I'll just go back.

1264
01:31:28,101 --> 01:31:30,972
- We know you're in there!
- Come on, unlock this door!

1265
01:31:31,104 --> 01:31:33,773
Come here and hold onto me
before I change my mind.

1266
01:31:33,898 --> 01:31:36,520
Go ahead, change your mind.

1267
01:31:36,651 --> 01:31:38,774
Come on!

1268
01:31:38,903 --> 01:31:40,646
I'm coming!

1269
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:45,073
I always got A's in gym,
but this could be ridiculous.

1270
01:31:45,201 --> 01:31:48,486
- This is a mistake!
- Yes, it is!

1271
01:31:55,377 --> 01:31:56,705
Yeah!

1272
01:31:59,130 --> 01:32:01,372
That was different, Spencer.

1273
01:32:04,469 --> 01:32:07,838
- Are you all right?
- That was batman.

1274
01:32:09,682 --> 01:32:13,466
We can still hear the game on the radio.
Let's get in the car.

1275
01:32:15,145 --> 01:32:17,767
And it's strike three
and the Cubs have won it!

1276
01:32:17,898 --> 01:32:21,314
The 1990 World Champions
are the Chicago Cubs.

1277
01:32:21,443 --> 01:32:23,649
- They did it!
- They won!

1278
01:32:23,779 --> 01:32:28,072
All I can say is holy cow, Joe.
You're witness to history.

1279
01:32:28,199 --> 01:32:31,864
For the first time since 1908,
the Cubs have won the World series.

1280
01:32:31,995 --> 01:32:34,949
I repeat, the Cubs have won the World...

1281
01:32:35,081 --> 01:32:37,323
Why are you turning it off?

1282
01:32:37,458 --> 01:32:39,285
They won.

1283
01:32:39,418 --> 01:32:41,292
It's over.

1284
01:32:43,005 --> 01:32:45,922
The weekend's over.

1285
01:32:48,969 --> 01:32:50,926
Was it so bad being me?

1286
01:32:51,054 --> 01:32:53,462
No.

1287
01:32:53,598 --> 01:32:55,638
No, I liked it.

1288
01:32:55,767 --> 01:32:58,638
Everybody listened to me.
They took me seriously.

1289
01:33:00,063 --> 01:33:03,229
Jewel, too. she took me seriously.
I like her.

1290
01:33:04,025 --> 01:33:07,773
She was nice.
Yeah, I dug her.

1291
01:33:09,405 --> 01:33:12,406
I just wonder if she'll like me
as Jimmy Dworski.

1292
01:33:17,538 --> 01:33:21,867
If the cubs can win the World series,
anything's possible, right?

1293
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,950
All right. now I got to think
how to break back into prison.

1294
01:33:26,087 --> 01:33:28,163
Why would you want to do that?

1295
01:33:28,298 --> 01:33:32,710
I got to. I escaped, now I got to
break back in so I can be released.

1296
01:33:33,344 --> 01:33:36,962
I found it. It was in my Filofax.

1297
01:33:37,098 --> 01:33:39,849
They should be in their car by now.

1298
01:33:42,561 --> 01:33:45,681
Let me ask you something.
How will you get back in prison

1299
01:33:45,814 --> 01:33:48,352
with the photographers
and reporters there?

1300
01:33:48,483 --> 01:33:51,568
I can't believe I never thought of that.

1301
01:33:51,695 --> 01:33:53,652
Why didn't I think of that?

1302
01:33:55,782 --> 01:33:56,564
Hello?

1303
01:33:56,699 --> 01:34:00,364
All right. Jewel and I want to know
what the hell is going on.

1304
01:34:00,495 --> 01:34:01,823
Where are you?

1305
01:34:01,954 --> 01:34:03,864
- I'm at Walter's.
- Where?

1306
01:34:03,998 --> 01:34:06,287
Answer me. What is going on?

1307
01:34:06,417 --> 01:34:08,908
I lost my Filofax.

1308
01:34:09,044 --> 01:34:10,076
You what?

1309
01:34:10,212 --> 01:34:11,457
And I quit my job.

1310
01:34:11,589 --> 01:34:13,628
- Are you serious?
- What?

1311
01:34:13,757 --> 01:34:17,755
Elizabeth, I miss you so much.

1312
01:34:17,886 --> 01:34:21,966
I have so many things to tell you.
The most important thing is...

1313
01:34:22,098 --> 01:34:24,850
I love you.

1314
01:34:27,270 --> 01:34:28,729
I love you, too.

1315
01:34:30,481 --> 01:34:34,431
Will you ask my Spencer
if we're still on for tomorrow?

1316
01:34:34,568 --> 01:34:38,518
Jewel wants to know if she
and the Spencer who caught the ball

1317
01:34:38,656 --> 01:34:40,399
are still on for tomorrow.

1318
01:34:40,532 --> 01:34:44,482
Are you and Jewel on for tomorrow?

1319
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:46,992
I don't know.

1320
01:34:47,122 --> 01:34:50,242
How am I going to break back into prison?

1321
01:34:50,375 --> 01:34:52,451
Wait a minute.

1322
01:34:52,585 --> 01:34:56,168
Oh, my God. Yes!
Yes, they are on for tomorrow.

1323
01:34:56,297 --> 01:34:59,748
- Yes, you're on.
- We are? Great!

1324
01:34:59,884 --> 01:35:01,793
How about we go to Hawaii?

1325
01:35:01,928 --> 01:35:04,501
We leave tonight.

1326
01:35:04,638 --> 01:35:05,638
We will.

1327
01:35:05,765 --> 01:35:08,849
Why, for the first time,
do I really believe you?

1328
01:35:08,976 --> 01:35:12,179
Because like my pal here says,
I got a lot of free time.

1329
01:35:12,312 --> 01:35:15,479
My calendar is blank.
In fact, I don't even have a calendar.

1330
01:35:15,607 --> 01:35:19,106
We leave tonight. but first,
there's something I have to do.

1331
01:35:23,031 --> 01:35:25,107
Debbie...

1332
01:35:26,701 --> 01:35:27,816
I'm sorry.

1333
01:35:27,952 --> 01:35:30,158
Spencer...

1334
01:35:31,914 --> 01:35:36,327
Oh, Spencer.

1335
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:38,785
Hi, there.

1336
01:35:42,716 --> 01:35:44,673
Thank you.

1337
01:35:50,098 --> 01:35:52,007
The warden's expecting us.

1338
01:35:52,142 --> 01:35:56,435
Just pull over there in front of
that guard. I'll call the warden.

1339
01:36:03,277 --> 01:36:05,234
Father Barnes.

1340
01:36:07,948 --> 01:36:10,735
That's quite a car.

1341
01:36:10,868 --> 01:36:14,236
It was a very kind donation to the parish.

1342
01:36:14,371 --> 01:36:16,494
A red Lotus.

1343
01:36:17,123 --> 01:36:19,163
Do you pray, my son?

1344
01:36:19,292 --> 01:36:22,957
- Not as much as I should, father.
- I can see it in your face.

1345
01:36:23,838 --> 01:36:25,546
What is your given name?

1346
01:36:25,673 --> 01:36:28,674
Captain Toolman.
I hope you can help us.

1347
01:36:28,801 --> 01:36:31,636
- Well, I'm not alone.
- I understand.

1348
01:36:31,762 --> 01:36:34,965
No, I mean I brought someone with me.

1349
01:36:35,099 --> 01:36:37,305
Jimmy Dworski's mother.

1350
01:36:43,106 --> 01:36:46,273
Mrs. Dworski, captain Toolman.

1351
01:36:47,652 --> 01:36:52,480
I hope you can help me.
I'm so worried about my poor Jimmy.

1352
01:36:52,615 --> 01:36:55,984
What are you going to do?

1353
01:36:56,118 --> 01:36:59,238
We'll send for somebody.

1354
01:37:04,376 --> 01:37:09,168
Where in the hell is Jimmy at?
Can't keep this up all night.

1355
01:37:09,298 --> 01:37:12,417
Gentlemen, listen up.
This is the warden.

1356
01:37:12,551 --> 01:37:16,002
We have a professional mediator
who'd like to talk to you.

1357
01:37:16,137 --> 01:37:17,216
Mediator?

1358
01:37:17,347 --> 01:37:19,553
- He's with jimmy's mother.
- Jimmy's mother?

1359
01:37:19,682 --> 01:37:20,797
Bad news.

1360
01:37:20,934 --> 01:37:24,516
All right, father. she's all yours.

1361
01:37:25,104 --> 01:37:27,512
Hello, prisoners.

1362
01:37:27,648 --> 01:37:28,977
It's Father Barnes.

1363
01:37:29,108 --> 01:37:31,515
I'm here with jimmy's mother.

1364
01:37:31,652 --> 01:37:34,107
Mrs. Dworski.

1365
01:37:34,238 --> 01:37:38,105
This must end.
We want to come in and talk to you.

1366
01:37:38,241 --> 01:37:42,820
No way. We're not letting anyone in.

1367
01:37:42,954 --> 01:37:45,908
Especially a mother.

1368
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:51,497
If you let us in, the warden
will promise complete forgiveness.

1369
01:37:51,629 --> 01:37:53,918
- No punishment.
- What?

1370
01:37:57,259 --> 01:37:59,929
- Better food.
- Better food.

1371
01:38:00,054 --> 01:38:01,085
Better what?

1372
01:38:01,221 --> 01:38:07,390
"Cast ye loaves across the water,
and they will return to the shore."

1373
01:38:07,519 --> 01:38:09,927
And I promise you better food.

1374
01:38:15,693 --> 01:38:18,896
What the hell.
Maybe we should let them in.

1375
01:38:19,030 --> 01:38:21,651
- What about Jimmy?
- We can't give up.

1376
01:38:21,782 --> 01:38:23,822
Jimmy's a homie.

1377
01:38:25,703 --> 01:38:30,246
Forget it. yall try to come in here,
we'll kill him dead.

1378
01:38:33,293 --> 01:38:35,500
Help me!

1379
01:38:35,629 --> 01:38:37,787
I don't want to die.

1380
01:38:43,386 --> 01:38:47,715
Help me, man! I'm scared!

1381
01:38:47,849 --> 01:38:50,849
I say we use the tear gas
and flush them out of there.

1382
01:38:55,272 --> 01:38:58,475
They say they have a color TV
for Lebradford brown.

1383
01:38:58,609 --> 01:39:01,016
Is that part of the strategy?

1384
01:39:01,153 --> 01:39:04,735
Home shopping club.
I used your credit card.

1385
01:39:04,865 --> 01:39:07,616
Yes, we did. We ordered that.

1386
01:39:07,742 --> 01:39:10,198
- What now?
- The governor's mediators are here.

1387
01:39:10,328 --> 01:39:14,575
How many mediators
do they think we need?

1388
01:39:14,707 --> 01:39:15,822
Shit!

1389
01:39:22,173 --> 01:39:24,664
You have no idea...

1390
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:28,584
how much I understand
what you're going through.

1391
01:39:28,721 --> 01:39:30,630
Look at her, man.

1392
01:39:30,764 --> 01:39:33,635
- She look like the missing link.
- I think she's kind of cute.

1393
01:39:33,767 --> 01:39:36,970
- Yeah, you would.
- Forget it! no one's coming in.

1394
01:39:37,103 --> 01:39:39,345
Warden Toolman,
we're from the governor's office.

1395
01:39:39,481 --> 01:39:41,023
- Gentlemen.
- Agent Jackson.

1396
01:39:41,149 --> 01:39:43,141
Pay attention, boys.

1397
01:39:43,276 --> 01:39:47,024
You were specifically instructed not
to make any promises to the inmates.

1398
01:39:47,155 --> 01:39:50,072
We're interrupting the proceedings
and taking over.

1399
01:39:50,199 --> 01:39:53,449
Let me in, goddamn it!

1400
01:39:53,577 --> 01:39:55,700
What the hell is she doing?

1401
01:39:55,829 --> 01:39:58,367
She's signaling.

1402
01:39:58,499 --> 01:40:02,662
How does she know our signal?
She ain't no homie!

1403
01:40:02,794 --> 01:40:06,661
- "Steal home?"
- "Intentional walk?"

1404
01:40:06,798 --> 01:40:08,078
"Go home?"

1405
01:40:08,216 --> 01:40:09,710
Let me in!

1406
01:40:09,843 --> 01:40:12,084
That ain't no missing link.

1407
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:14,129
That's Jimmy.

1408
01:40:17,767 --> 01:40:19,724
Father, what is she doing?

1409
01:40:21,395 --> 01:40:26,436
She is doing a special prayer
that I taught her. Excuse me.

1410
01:40:26,567 --> 01:40:28,974
- We're going to go in.
- No, look.

1411
01:40:35,659 --> 01:40:40,404
Ok. They can come in,
but only the mother and the father.

1412
01:40:43,916 --> 01:40:45,327
Close it!

1413
01:40:45,459 --> 01:40:48,211
Where's my Jimmy?

1414
01:40:50,214 --> 01:40:53,713
Right this way, Mrs. Dworski.

1415
01:40:53,842 --> 01:40:57,045
Did you see that catch I made?

1416
01:41:03,059 --> 01:41:05,930
These heels are killing me.

1417
01:41:06,062 --> 01:41:07,889
Damn it, what took you so long?

1418
01:41:08,022 --> 01:41:10,692
I was at the hairdresser
or I'd been here earlier.

1419
01:41:10,817 --> 01:41:14,399
- No hair jokes.
- This is for you, heavy G.

1420
01:41:14,529 --> 01:41:18,573
Get me out of these clothes.
It's so hard to be a woman.

1421
01:41:19,867 --> 01:41:23,117
All right, shut up!

1422
01:41:24,621 --> 01:41:27,029
I'm going to keep the nails.

1423
01:41:29,376 --> 01:41:34,453
Spencer, come here.
Guys, this is Spencer Barnes, my friend.

1424
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:39,669
Good work, you got us in.
That Debbie's a talented girl.

1425
01:41:39,802 --> 01:41:44,429
She gave me her number.
She wanted to make sure you had it.

1426
01:41:44,557 --> 01:41:47,130
- She's a nice lady.
- She's good, isn't she?

1427
01:41:47,268 --> 01:41:50,601
You take care of yourself
and try to stay out of trouble.

1428
01:41:50,729 --> 01:41:54,596
- Really, man. And thanks.
- Look me up when you get out.

1429
01:41:54,733 --> 01:41:57,603
Ok. I get out in about 20 minutes.

1430
01:41:57,736 --> 01:42:00,405
In that case, forget it.

1431
01:42:02,282 --> 01:42:04,570
All right. here, like this.

1432
01:42:08,037 --> 01:42:11,240
There you go, Spencer Barnes.
Have a good trip.

1433
01:42:15,252 --> 01:42:18,004
I'm free!

1434
01:42:18,130 --> 01:42:21,001
Warden, I never thought I'd get out.

1435
01:42:21,133 --> 01:42:23,968
I didn't know I'd get out
of that horrible place.

1436
01:42:24,094 --> 01:42:27,926
- I thought I'd be there forever.
- You're wearing lipstick.

1437
01:42:28,056 --> 01:42:31,756
- My mom gave me a big kiss.
- Where is your mom?

1438
01:42:31,893 --> 01:42:34,810
- I smell perfume.
- Don't be stupid, the press is watching.

1439
01:42:34,938 --> 01:42:37,144
- Thank you, everybody.
- You're welcome.

1440
01:42:37,273 --> 01:42:39,681
He's the greatest warden
a guy could have.

1441
01:42:39,817 --> 01:42:41,644
Just my job, Jim.

1442
01:42:41,777 --> 01:42:44,648
Will I still be released today?

1443
01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:47,449
- Will I?
- Of course you'll be released today.

1444
01:42:47,575 --> 01:42:49,900
Thank you!

1445
01:42:50,994 --> 01:42:52,453
You're the best!

1446
01:42:52,579 --> 01:42:56,446
All right. Don't do that again, please.

1447
01:42:57,751 --> 01:43:00,835
- Get out of here, man.
- Hope I never see you again.

1448
01:43:00,962 --> 01:43:03,002
Take it easy.

1449
01:43:08,886 --> 01:43:12,884
- What are you doing here?
- Figured you'd need a ride.

1450
01:43:17,436 --> 01:43:19,594
Thanks a lot, man.

1451
01:43:22,190 --> 01:43:25,025
And I needed someone to start the car.

1452
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:29,112
Now that I can do.

1453
01:43:38,831 --> 01:43:40,989
- Hello?
- Spencer Barnes, please.

1454
01:43:41,125 --> 01:43:43,201
- Mr. Sakamoto.
- Glad I found you.

1455
01:43:43,335 --> 01:43:46,834
- Nice to hear your voice, too.
- Is the other Spencer there?

1456
01:43:46,964 --> 01:43:50,498
- Yes, he is here.
- Good. You two impress me.

1457
01:43:50,634 --> 01:43:52,757
We enjoyed meeting you as well.

1458
01:43:52,886 --> 01:43:55,377
I want you both to come work for me.

1459
01:43:55,514 --> 01:43:59,297
- You want to hire us both?
- You make a good team.

1460
01:43:59,434 --> 01:44:02,185
How much did you have in mind?

1461
01:44:02,312 --> 01:44:05,147
I was thinking 25 a month.

1462
01:44:05,273 --> 01:44:06,850
Thousand?

1463
01:44:06,983 --> 01:44:09,770
You'd head my American
advertising operation.

1464
01:44:09,902 --> 01:44:12,607
- A month?
- Of course we're flattered.

1465
01:44:12,738 --> 01:44:15,525
We'll need a little time
to think that over.

1466
01:44:15,657 --> 01:44:19,157
- No time. I know. Take it.
- We'll get back to you shortly.

1467
01:44:19,286 --> 01:44:23,615
- Take your time. You need a vacation.
- Thank you. bye.

1468
01:44:24,499 --> 01:44:25,662
What, are you nuts?

1469
01:44:25,792 --> 01:44:29,042
Business lesson number one.
Never take your first offer.

1470
01:44:31,589 --> 01:44:36,167
Yeah, right. That's just like baseball.
Don't swing at your first pitch.

1471
01:44:36,302 --> 01:44:38,627
Wait a second.

1472
01:44:38,763 --> 01:44:42,427
Just one quick second.

1473
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:56,479
I don't know where the TV came from...

1474
01:45:04,495 --> 01:45:06,903
Ok, partner. Let's go.
