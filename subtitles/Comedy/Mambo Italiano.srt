1
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:55,552
- Mr. Barberini.
- Concettina!

2
00:01:55,723 --> 00:01:57,190
- Maria!
- Eduardo.

3
00:01:57,358 --> 00:01:59,292
Gino.

4
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:34,492
- Maria. Gino.
- Giorgio, Rosetta, <i>come state</i>?

5
00:02:34,662 --> 00:02:37,927
<i>Bene, bene</i>. How come your Angelo
never called back my Teresa?

6
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,964
He didn't have fun
when they went out?

7
00:02:40,134 --> 00:02:44,434
Of course he had fun. He just didn't
have time to call her. My apologies.

8
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:49,508
No, no, no, it's only because Teresa,
she worry he wasn't feeling well.

9
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:51,645
She said he looked pale.

10
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,877
- Angelo? He's fine.
- Never been better.

11
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,745
I am so fucked.

12
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:05,018
- This is Gay Line. How can I help?
- I am so fucked.

13
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,520
- How so?
- Where do I start?

14
00:03:13,835 --> 00:03:16,326
- Hello?
- Start with the beginning.

15
00:03:16,504 --> 00:03:17,732
<i>The beginning?</i>

16
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:20,436
Yes.

17
00:03:20,842 --> 00:03:23,675
When did it all start?

18
00:03:23,845 --> 00:03:27,781
The day I invited my parents to come
see my new apartment, I guess.

19
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:30,645
No, Ma, don't touch anything
till the cops get here!

20
00:03:30,818 --> 00:03:34,777
- Want them to think you live like a pig?
- Why did this have to happen to us?

21
00:03:34,956 --> 00:03:38,187
No, that's not right.
In reality, it all started...

22
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:42,159
<i>... when my parents left Italy to come</i>
<i>to America and settled in Canada.</i>

23
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,096
<i>Destination, Montreal.</i>
<i>And my father has yet to get over it.</i>

24
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,531
Nobody told us there was
two America:

25
00:03:48,703 --> 00:03:52,195
The real one, United State,
and the fake one, Canada.

26
00:03:52,373 --> 00:03:56,537
Then, to make matter even worse,
there's two Canada:

27
00:03:56,711 --> 00:04:01,444
The real one, Ontario,
and the fake one, Quebec.

28
00:04:03,184 --> 00:04:05,880
<i>My parents tried desperately</i>
<i>to start a family...</i>

29
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:09,489
<i>... but after many</i>
<i>unsuccessful attempts...</i>

30
00:04:09,657 --> 00:04:12,217
<i>... they pretty much</i>
<i>gave up on the idea.</i>

31
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:13,955
Get off of me.

32
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,323
<i>Then, after what my mother</i>
<i>refers to as...</i>

33
00:04:16,497 --> 00:04:18,897
What your father did to me
while I was sleeping.

34
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:23,730
<i>... my sister Anna was born.</i>
<i>Followed by me, Angelo Barberini.</i>

35
00:04:24,505 --> 00:04:28,805
<i>I grew up in a quiet, peaceful</i>
<i>neighborhood. But from the inside...</i>

36
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,143
- No, you can't play in the park.
- You'll get kidnapped.

37
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,508
- No, you can't go swimming.
- You'll drown.

38
00:04:34,682 --> 00:04:36,980
No, you can't go eat
at the Bouchards' house.

39
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,642
- They're not Italian.
- Their food will kill you.

40
00:04:45,226 --> 00:04:48,389
<i>Then there was my Aunt Yolanda.</i>
<i>Always trying to inject life...</i>

41
00:04:48,563 --> 00:04:52,431
<i>... into an otherwise</i>
<i>death-at-your-doorstep existence.</i>

42
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:57,302
Hey, Yo. Can you shut it, that music?

43
00:04:57,772 --> 00:05:00,104
What she has to be happy about,
I don't know.

44
00:05:00,274 --> 00:05:03,243
<i>My sister Anna had her own</i>
<i>special way of calming herself.</i>

45
00:05:03,411 --> 00:05:05,743
<i>A tasty little treat called Icesuckle.</i>

46
00:05:06,414 --> 00:05:09,645
<i>To this day she denies that she</i>
<i>has an addictive personality.</i>

47
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,982
<i>My best friend Nino</i>
<i>was always up to something.</i>

48
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:28,230
<i>Nino and I were inseparable.</i>

49
00:05:30,238 --> 00:05:33,366
<i>I enjoyed school. I looked forward</i>
<i>to going every day, until:</i>

50
00:05:35,142 --> 00:05:37,702
<i>St. Pius X Comprehensive</i>
<i>High School.</i>

51
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,076
<i>Fifteen hundred students,</i>
<i>99.9% Italian...</i>

52
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:43,717
<i>... all looking for someone to pick on.</i>

53
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,453
<i>And when I got there,</i>
<i>their quest was over.</i>

54
00:05:51,826 --> 00:05:55,318
<i>I could take the humiliation</i>
<i>of being human graffiti...</i>

55
00:05:56,197 --> 00:05:59,792
<i>... but when Nino started being</i>
<i>ashamed to be seen with me...</i>

56
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:12,542
<i>He'd talk to me only on Saturday.</i>
<i>On weekends it was like old times.</i>

57
00:06:12,713 --> 00:06:16,376
<i>Eventually, Nino stopped</i>
<i>coming over even on Saturdays.</i>

58
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,747
<i>I guess word got around</i>
<i>that he was hanging out with me.</i>

59
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,523
<i>That's when my Aunt Yolanda</i>
<i>became my best friend.</i>

60
00:06:35,136 --> 00:06:36,831
<i>She was something, my aunt.</i>

61
00:06:37,004 --> 00:06:40,462
<i>She wanted to become</i>
<i>an actress, a movie star.</i>

62
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:43,633
<i>But the</i> famiglia
<i>had other plans for her:</i>

63
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:49,043
<i>And shortly after</i>
<i>they married her off...</i>

64
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:57,224
Don't cry, <i>figlio mio</i>.
Yolanda is in heaven now.

65
00:06:57,391 --> 00:07:01,054
<i>After she died, the only thing</i>
<i>that brought me joy was television.</i>

66
00:07:02,496 --> 00:07:04,726
<i>I'd tape my favorite shows,</i>
<i>watch them...</i>

67
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:07,527
<i>... and write down</i>
<i>every word of the script.</i>

68
00:07:10,137 --> 00:07:14,073
<i>A couple of hours a day I would forget</i>
<i>that I was nothing but a piece of shit.</i>

69
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,510
<i>Unlike me, my sister</i>
<i>was quite popular in high school.</i>

70
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:25,411
<i>Who knew all those Icesuckles</i>
<i>would pay off one day.</i>

71
00:07:28,422 --> 00:07:31,255
<i>I made it through high school</i>
<i>and decided it was time...</i>

72
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:34,189
<i>... I tell the world a secret</i>
<i>that was buried inside me.</i>

73
00:07:34,362 --> 00:07:36,023
I'm gonna be a television writer.

74
00:07:36,197 --> 00:07:37,960
<i>My mother still refers to this as:</i>

75
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:40,600
The day you took 10 years off my life.

76
00:07:40,768 --> 00:07:43,362
<i>So I went to university to study law.</i>

77
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:46,335
<i>But I quit after three months</i>
<i>of mind-numbing boredom...</i>

78
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:50,603
<i>... and found a job in the</i>
<i>glamorous world of corporate travel.</i>

79
00:07:50,778 --> 00:07:53,872
<i>A perfect occupation for a</i>
<i>go-getter thirsting to be abused...</i>

80
00:07:54,048 --> 00:07:56,710
<i>... by rich business people</i>
<i>and/or their assistants...</i>

81
00:07:56,884 --> 00:07:58,875
<i>... and/or their assistant's assistants.</i>

82
00:07:59,053 --> 00:08:01,783
I am so sorry, sir.
I take full responsibility.

83
00:08:01,956 --> 00:08:05,619
When you said "Paris," it was stupid
to assume you were going to France.

84
00:08:05,793 --> 00:08:09,490
Of course, I should have guessed that
you had a branch office in Ontario.

85
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:12,860
Oh, everyone spoke French?
Oh, that must've been horrible.

86
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,865
Yes, sir, it's completely my fault.

87
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:19,166
Though I am surprised that the
layover in Brussels didn't tip you off.

88
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,705
Common mistake, sir.

89
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,538
Brussels is considered by many
to be the Minneapolis of Europe.

90
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,543
<i>I hate my job.</i>

91
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,875
<i>Thank God for my exciting social life.</i>

92
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,450
- Ma, it's my first glass.
- It's your second.

93
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:34,383
If your mother say it's your second,
it's your second.

94
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,649
Like your side of the family.
Always with a glass in her hand.

95
00:08:37,992 --> 00:08:41,018
Your Uncle Dominic died
because of his heavy drinking.

96
00:08:41,195 --> 00:08:44,255
For you information, my brother
Dominic die of lung cancer.

97
00:08:44,432 --> 00:08:47,458
It was your Aunt Yolanda
who drowned in a barrel of whiskey.

98
00:08:47,635 --> 00:08:50,160
If we're gonna have a argument
about who died...

99
00:08:50,337 --> 00:08:54,137
...I'm leaving the table.
- Nobody leave until you finish supper.

100
00:08:54,308 --> 00:08:56,572
Yeah? What happens
if I leave the table?

101
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,302
That's what happen.

102
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:01,004
There is nothing like
a relaxing evening at home.

103
00:09:01,182 --> 00:09:04,083
<i>I should know.</i>
<i>I didn't move out until I was 27.</i>

104
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:05,980
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

105
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:07,677
<i>I have this neighbor, Massimo.</i>

106
00:09:07,855 --> 00:09:11,382
<i>Sixty-nine years old, never married</i>
<i>and still living at home.</i>

107
00:09:12,626 --> 00:09:15,117
<i>It's a cultural thing.</i>
<i>Italians leave the house...</i>

108
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:17,355
<i>... either two ways: Married or dead.</i>

109
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:20,861
<i>And knowing for sure</i>
<i>that I would never get married...</i>

110
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:23,094
<i>... I knew I had to do</i>
<i>something drastic.</i>

111
00:09:26,373 --> 00:09:28,102
Why?!

112
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:32,370
Why?! Why?!

113
00:09:33,314 --> 00:09:36,841
Just go. And don't look back.

114
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:50,894
<i>Leaving was easy. Bringing them to</i>
<i>my new apartment was the hard part.</i>

115
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:53,560
This building gotta be
a hundred year old.

116
00:09:53,734 --> 00:09:56,897
- That's part of its charm.
- What's charming about it being old?

117
00:09:57,071 --> 00:09:59,801
- We're old.
- We're not charming.

118
00:10:00,341 --> 00:10:02,775
No, Ma, don't touch anything
till the cops get here.

119
00:10:02,943 --> 00:10:06,811
- Want them to think you live like a pig?
- Why did this have to happen to us?

120
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,677
Me, Pa, it happened to me.
I'm the one who got robbed.

121
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,445
No rob! This is act of terrorism
against Italian people.

122
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:16,954
- I want you to move back home.
- No, Ma, I am not moving back home!

123
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:18,921
Come in at your own risk.

124
00:10:19,593 --> 00:10:22,118
Oh, officer, thank God you're here.

125
00:10:22,296 --> 00:10:25,060
Tell my son that this is not
a safe neighborhood.

126
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:28,929
- These things happen all over the city.
- Paventi.

127
00:10:29,103 --> 00:10:31,094
- Nino?
- That's right. How are you?

128
00:10:31,272 --> 00:10:34,833
Nino! Gino, this is Nino.

129
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,000
Lina's son!

130
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:41,114
- Nino! Angelo, you remember?
- Actually, that's why I took the call.

131
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:45,350
I wanted to see what my old bud
was up to.

132
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,816
Being attacked by thugs.

133
00:10:47,321 --> 00:10:49,812
Not much has changed
since we last saw each other.

134
00:10:51,592 --> 00:10:54,925
<i>And then it was like old times.</i>

135
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:03,660
- You're not enjoying this, are you?
- You kidding? I am so enjoying this.

136
00:11:03,837 --> 00:11:07,000
- We could always go back.
- And get out of this wonderful...

137
00:11:07,174 --> 00:11:10,405
...woody wilderness?
No, I am loving this. Really.

138
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:20,286
- What's that?
- A Grand Horned Canadian Owl.

139
00:11:21,522 --> 00:11:23,615
Cool.

140
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:27,558
And that is the cry of a frog.

141
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:31,323
No, that is the sound
of a northern Quebec bullfrog.

142
00:11:33,801 --> 00:11:35,291
That is a cell phone.

143
00:11:35,469 --> 00:11:38,961
No, that is the cry of an Italian
mother who's worried about her son.

144
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:41,505
I should've recognized that cry.

145
00:11:42,476 --> 00:11:44,068
- <i>Nino.</i>
- Hi, Mom.

146
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,339
- Bello<i>, why did you take so long to</i>...<i>?</i>
- Everything's fine, Ma.

147
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:49,641
<i>And Marco, how is he?</i>

148
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:51,978
Marco's doing good.

149
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:56,583
Marco, my mom says "Hi."

150
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,453
Hello, Nino's mother.

151
00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:02,187
Marco says "Hi" back.

152
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:06,094
My mom wants to know if your mom
is still having problems with digestion.

153
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:10,033
No, there is no one in North America
who digests better than my mother.

154
00:12:10,204 --> 00:12:12,536
- She' s fine, Ma.
- She can digest anything.

155
00:12:12,706 --> 00:12:15,766
- Getting it out is the problem.
- <i>Are you in a bear-free zone?</i>

156
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:20,277
- Have a good night, Ma.
- <i>How can I have a good night</i>...<i>?</i>

157
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,609
Marco?

158
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:26,617
He's the guy I work with.
You know, I just...

159
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:31,349
Don't be embarrassed. I'm presently
at a convention in Seattle.

160
00:12:32,026 --> 00:12:33,254
Good one.

161
00:12:47,007 --> 00:12:52,411
- Just like old times, huh?
- Yup. Spending Saturday together.

162
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:55,880
- You gonna ignore me on Monday?
- I'm so sorry about that.

163
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,781
- Hey, I was just joking.
- No, listen...

164
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:03,411
...I wanna say something about that.
Dropping you the way I did...

165
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:08,050
- Forget about it.
- It was shitty of me. I apologize.

166
00:13:08,228 --> 00:13:10,788
- Apology accepted.
- That quick?

167
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:12,932
What can I say? I'm easy.

168
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:20,268
<i>Oh, boy, did we reunite that night.</i>

169
00:13:41,428 --> 00:13:45,159
So you get there a couple
hours later, does it really matter?

170
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,828
It matters that much, huh?

171
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,641
Shit.

172
00:14:03,484 --> 00:14:08,547
There. Now all that's left for you to do
is tell your mother you're moving in.

173
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,950
Do I have to?

174
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:16,753
Come on, Mama. I'll come
see you every day, I promise. I'Il...

175
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:22,927
<i>It's a miracle Lina</i>
<i>didn't have a stroke.</i>

176
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:25,697
What is wrong with living here
until you get married?

177
00:14:25,873 --> 00:14:28,535
Both your father and me did it,
and we're not dead.

178
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:31,109
- We still here.
- Yeah. After we got married...

179
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:32,870
...we had our mothers with us.

180
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:35,571
And your crazy Aunt Yolanda
until she got married!

181
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,910
My sister Yolanda was not crazy!

182
00:14:38,352 --> 00:14:40,479
Let me ask you a question, okay?

183
00:14:40,654 --> 00:14:43,214
How come you prefer
to live with Nino...

184
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,484
...instead of with me and your mama
and your sister. Why?!

185
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,118
Let me ask you a question. Why is
Nino a better roommate than us?

186
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,161
- Because.
- Because why?

187
00:14:52,332 --> 00:14:54,596
Because Nino's my lover.

188
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:57,259
- <i>lf only I could say that out loud.</i>
- You didn't?

189
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,874
- No. Every time I try to, I freeze.
- Why is that?

190
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:05,478
Because being gay and Italian
is a fate worse than...

191
00:15:05,646 --> 00:15:08,672
Actually, there is no fate
worse than being gay and Italian.

192
00:15:08,849 --> 00:15:13,513
To top things off, my mother keeps on
setting me up with nice Italian girls.

193
00:15:18,192 --> 00:15:20,285
<i>And like an idiot, I go out with them.</i>

194
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,555
<i>And then I feel like a louse</i>
<i>for not calling them back.</i>

195
00:15:25,566 --> 00:15:27,557
All this lying. It's sapping my energy.

196
00:15:27,734 --> 00:15:31,295
Nino and I made a deal. No one can
know about the two of us except us.

197
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:35,668
<i>Only, my poor sister Anna knows.</i>
<i>She found out by accident.</i>

198
00:15:35,843 --> 00:15:37,071
<i>That is so like her.</i>

199
00:15:37,244 --> 00:15:39,906
- You okay?
- I will be once the Valium kicks in.

200
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,605
- It's not what you think.
- Who's thinking? I'm not.

201
00:15:42,783 --> 00:15:45,013
- I am so sorry.
- Why sorry? I'm thrilled.

202
00:15:45,185 --> 00:15:46,618
You two are a couple.

203
00:15:46,787 --> 00:15:51,087
I reacted the way I did because
I saw my brother naked. I gotta go.

204
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,986
- Hey, you just got here.
- Did I?

205
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,095
Time flies when you're mortified.

206
00:15:57,197 --> 00:16:01,566
- You make a beautiful couple.
- Did you hear that?

207
00:16:01,735 --> 00:16:03,965
- Mortified.
- She'll get over it.

208
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:06,037
Yeah, but will I?

209
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:08,834
Understand that Nino has an image
he has to uphold.

210
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:11,302
- Macho cop?
- No, respected cop.

211
00:16:11,478 --> 00:16:14,675
All right, just relax, sir,
and everything's gonna be fine.

212
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,612
- Everything will be all right.
- I think this bastard...

213
00:16:17,784 --> 00:16:19,513
...needs a lesson in etiquette.

214
00:16:19,686 --> 00:16:22,519
- Your mother's a whore.
- Hey. Cool it, Marco.

215
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:25,749
- No one calls my mother a whore.
- Your father calls her that.

216
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:27,561
- But he's family.
- Nino is by far the best thing...

217
00:16:27,561 --> 00:16:28,459
- But he's family.
- Nino is by far the best thing...

218
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:32,963
...that ever happened to me.
Not only is he loving, he is supportive.

219
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:37,194
<i>He's the first one who didn't laugh</i>
<i>when I said I wanted to write for TV.</i>

220
00:16:41,742 --> 00:16:44,802
When you said "mile-high club,"
I thought you meant a sandwich.

221
00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:47,071
- Sure you did.
- My husband's on the plane.

222
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:51,741
Don't worry about your husband.
He's in the bathroom with my copilot.

223
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,855
- Then who's flying the plane?
- Who cares?

224
00:16:56,023 --> 00:16:57,718
<i>Wow.</i>

225
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:01,987
- Wow?
- Oh, yeah. This is fucking brilliant.

226
00:17:02,162 --> 00:17:03,390
- Really?
- Yeah.

227
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,828
The characters, the story, it's all there.

228
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:09,994
- You're not just saying that because...
- No, Angelo, it's amazing.

229
00:17:11,538 --> 00:17:15,531
- I am so proud of you.
- <i>Nino is by far my biggest fan.</i>

230
00:17:26,186 --> 00:17:27,983
<i>My only fan.</i>

231
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,782
- What's that for?
- To celebrate.

232
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,726
Celebrate what? That everyone
in the free world rejected my work?

233
00:17:36,897 --> 00:17:39,024
To celebrate that you
finished a script...

234
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:41,827
...and had the balls
to send it off to these idiots.

235
00:17:42,002 --> 00:17:43,367
Face it, Nino, I'm no good.

236
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:46,904
Even the receptionist advised me
to give up writing.

237
00:17:47,074 --> 00:17:49,406
Just wait till they read your next script.

238
00:17:49,576 --> 00:17:51,203
<i>How can I risk losing that?</i>

239
00:17:51,878 --> 00:17:53,846
But I'm sick and tired of pretending.

240
00:17:54,014 --> 00:17:56,414
<i>So, what are you saying?</i>

241
00:17:58,485 --> 00:18:03,218
I feel that with every day that goes by
I lose bits and pieces of myself.

242
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:08,851
And I'm afraid that if this goes on
I'll lose myself altogether.

243
00:18:10,364 --> 00:18:11,854
So...

244
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:16,495
So?

245
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:22,665
It's all become crystal clear.
I know what I have to do now.

246
00:18:22,843 --> 00:18:24,572
No more nice Italian girls for me.

247
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:30,045
Thank you, whoever you are...

248
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:33,880
...and have a good day. Okay.

249
00:18:35,055 --> 00:18:38,183
Goodnight. Bye. Sorry. See you.

250
00:18:44,064 --> 00:18:48,000
Did you ever wonder what it would
be like to come out of the closet?

251
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:51,899
No, it's nice and comfy in here,
Angelo.

252
00:18:52,072 --> 00:18:54,233
Didn't you ever feel
like telling anyone?

253
00:18:54,408 --> 00:18:57,741
Your sister Anna knows, and that's
more than enough, thank you.

254
00:18:58,578 --> 00:19:01,138
- Don't tell me you wanna come out.
- No way.

255
00:19:01,548 --> 00:19:05,006
Although I think my parents
might suspect.

256
00:19:05,552 --> 00:19:07,918
What's to suspect?

257
00:19:08,088 --> 00:19:10,522
We each have our own bedrooms...

258
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:14,650
...you date nice Italian girls
on a regular basis...

259
00:19:14,828 --> 00:19:17,228
...and we're macho studs, huh?

260
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:19,993
Fuck yeah.

261
00:19:26,973 --> 00:19:29,942
- Did you bring the Valium?
- Yeah. What's the big crisis?

262
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,237
Our parents. Ever since Pa retired...

263
00:19:32,412 --> 00:19:35,279
...they're at each other's throats.
Me, I can't take it.

264
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:38,179
- Move out.
- Move out? Easy for you to say. I can't.

265
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:40,376
They need me
now that you abandoned them.

266
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,546
- You are so fucked up.
- Tell me something I don't know.

267
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,954
- Besides, so are you.
- I am not.

268
00:19:46,126 --> 00:19:48,026
No? How's Nino, your roommate?

269
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:50,322
That's not fucked up.
That's in the closet.

270
00:19:50,497 --> 00:19:54,126
Oh, yeah? Well, being in the closet
is being fucked up.

271
00:19:58,305 --> 00:20:00,705
It'll do you good.

272
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,880
- Anna?
- What?

273
00:20:12,052 --> 00:20:14,612
How would our parents react
if I tell them I'm...?

274
00:20:14,788 --> 00:20:17,552
- A what? A fag?
- Hey.

275
00:20:17,724 --> 00:20:19,954
Are you retarded?
No way you're gonna tell.

276
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:21,890
- But...
- No, I live with our parents.

277
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:25,496
I'm the one who's gonna have to
deal with their melodramatics 24<i>l</i>7.

278
00:20:25,665 --> 00:20:28,429
Besides, Ma hasn't recovered
from Aunt Yolanda's death.

279
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,968
- She died 20 years ago.
- Yeah.

280
00:20:31,138 --> 00:20:35,234
- So you think this is gonna kill them?
- Yeah, this is gonna kill them.

281
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,176
Tell them.

282
00:20:40,714 --> 00:20:44,309
I want you to go see the doctor.

283
00:20:45,051 --> 00:20:47,315
How come I never have
good luck in my life?

284
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,785
You had luck. You never
took advantage of it.

285
00:20:49,956 --> 00:20:51,856
Don't start with me, okay, Maria?

286
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:55,517
My son told me he's <i>omosessuale.</i>
I gotta start with somebody, Gino.

287
00:20:55,695 --> 00:20:57,424
Everything will be okay.

288
00:20:57,597 --> 00:21:00,589
From this day on,
nothing will be okay.

289
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:03,361
- Go to your room.
- You turned my room into a den.

290
00:21:03,537 --> 00:21:06,631
- I told you to leave that room alone.
- It's all you fault.

291
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,468
My fault?

292
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,940
I wanted him to join
the hockey team.

293
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:14,638
- He don't like sports.
- Hockey would make him normal.

294
00:21:15,749 --> 00:21:19,947
Oh, why I had to live to hear this,
I don't know.

295
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,317
You see what you do?
You know the best thing you could do?

296
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,424
Leave the house
and go to the Village.

297
00:21:25,592 --> 00:21:27,890
I don't live in the Village.

298
00:21:28,795 --> 00:21:31,787
- What village?
- The homosexual Village.

299
00:21:31,965 --> 00:21:33,660
There's an <i>omosessuale</i> village?

300
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,667
On Sainte-Catherine Street
between Beaudry and Papineau.

301
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,237
How come you know
so much about this village?

302
00:21:39,406 --> 00:21:43,570
- I know a lot more than you think.
- Yes, but a <i>omosessuale</i> village?

303
00:21:43,743 --> 00:21:45,836
What? You gonna call me
homosexual now?

304
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:47,707
He's gotta get it from somebody!

305
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:50,812
Hey, guys. Look, this is not
the end of the world.

306
00:21:50,984 --> 00:21:55,648
- Nino and I, we love each other.
- I don't wanna hear it, okay?

307
00:21:55,822 --> 00:21:58,017
- But Pa...
- No, you listen to me.

308
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,159
That's what happen
when you move out.

309
00:22:00,327 --> 00:22:03,262
You fall in with the wrong crowd
and they brainwash you.

310
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,990
- Nobody brainwashed me!
- Yes, they did.

311
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,828
Because no son of mine
is a homosexual.

312
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:13,229
Now, the best thing you can do,
please leave the house and leave.

313
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,655
- Who else you gonna tell?
- No one.

314
00:22:37,831 --> 00:22:40,299
- These things spread.
- It's not gonna spread.

315
00:22:40,467 --> 00:22:44,369
What? You think my parents want
everyone to know their son is a fag?

316
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:49,632
- Did your mother tell my mother?
- No, and she's not gonna.

317
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:53,768
Look, my folks,
they took it relatively well.

318
00:22:53,947 --> 00:22:55,676
- Sure.
- Yeah.

319
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:59,080
Just don't eat anything
my mother offers you.

320
00:23:00,453 --> 00:23:03,547
- They threatened to kill me?
- No, but they are Italian.

321
00:23:03,957 --> 00:23:08,223
- Stop shitting on Italians.
- I don't shit on Italians.

322
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:12,227
- You're the classic self-hating Italian.
- I am not.

323
00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:15,027
Italians have greatly contributed
to civilization.

324
00:23:15,201 --> 00:23:18,170
We've given the world
Michelangelo, Fellini, the pizza.

325
00:23:18,338 --> 00:23:22,741
- Mussolini, the Mafia, garlic breath?
- Self-hating Italian.

326
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:36,821
- Maria, Gino, <i>come state</i>?
- <i>Benissimo</i>. Great.

327
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,925
- How is Angelo?
- What kind of question is that?

328
00:23:43,263 --> 00:23:44,787
Hey.

329
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,263
When I walk down the street,
everyone knows.

330
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:50,335
- Why couldn't I keep my mouth shut?
- I don't know if I can forgive him.

331
00:23:50,503 --> 00:23:53,939
- Seeing Nino so miserable kills me.
- A new gay world is your oyster.

332
00:23:54,107 --> 00:23:56,871
You even have a village.
Do I have a village? No.

333
00:23:57,043 --> 00:24:00,604
What am I gonna do with a village?
I have nothing in common with gays.

334
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,181
When no one knew, it didn't
seem real. Now it's official. I'm gay.

335
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:14,183
- Hey.
- Gino, my heart stops...

336
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:18,661
...every time I see you. How are you?

337
00:24:21,401 --> 00:24:26,202
Maria, what's the matter?
Are you not sleeping?

338
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:32,039
- What can I get for you?
- My husband's been dead 18 years...

339
00:24:32,212 --> 00:24:35,648
...what I need you can't offer
because you're married.

340
00:24:36,082 --> 00:24:39,711
We make a special arrangement.
What do you say? We help a friend.

341
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:45,916
- You're better off with your memories.
- Hey.

342
00:24:46,092 --> 00:24:52,031
So, what's wrong? What's the urgent
matter you had to see me about?

343
00:24:52,198 --> 00:24:53,825
What about our sons, huh?

344
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:07,838
- My son is a what?
- A homo.

345
00:25:08,415 --> 00:25:11,748
- And he turned our Angelo into one.
- Don't blame her son.

346
00:25:11,918 --> 00:25:14,853
- Who's to say it's not our son?
- I'm to say it's not.

347
00:25:15,021 --> 00:25:21,187
Are you saying that my Nino
is banging your Angelo?

348
00:25:21,361 --> 00:25:25,127
- I'm saying it's the other way around.
- What does it matter?

349
00:25:25,298 --> 00:25:27,596
Excuse me, sir, but if anybody...

350
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:31,464
...is not getting banged
around here, it's my Nino.

351
00:25:31,638 --> 00:25:34,300
And what make you think
it's Nino doing the banging?

352
00:25:34,474 --> 00:25:37,534
Because Nino is a banger.

353
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,644
- And Angelo is not?
- No.

354
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:44,110
Mrs. Paventi, I have to ask you
to leave the house!

355
00:25:44,284 --> 00:25:46,718
Gladly.

356
00:25:46,886 --> 00:25:49,912
Wait. We haven't discussed anything
of importance here.

357
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,254
What's to discuss? You invite me
over here to tell me a sick lie...

358
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:58,329
...so <i>finita la discussione.</i>

359
00:25:58,498 --> 00:26:01,865
- Oh, hi, Mrs. Paventi, how are you...?
- Fuck off!

360
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:10,776
My mom just told your mom.
Head for the hills.

361
00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:15,540
- Going somewhere?
- How'd you get in here?

362
00:26:15,715 --> 00:26:18,013
The door was locked,
the alarm system was on...

363
00:26:18,184 --> 00:26:20,948
Nino, I'm Sicilian.

364
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,119
- So you talked to...?
- <i>Si.</i>

365
00:26:30,296 --> 00:26:33,959
- Then you know...
- I know. I know everything.

366
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:37,297
- You're not angry?
- How can I be angry with you?

367
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,803
You're the only kid I got. I love you.

368
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,807
I forgive everything.

369
00:26:44,344 --> 00:26:46,244
- You do?
- It's your life.

370
00:26:46,412 --> 00:26:49,506
If you want to flush it down the toilet,
who am I to stop you?

371
00:26:49,682 --> 00:26:52,310
- Mama...
- lf you don't care about growing old...

372
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:57,149
...without a wife, without children
to look after you, what can I do?

373
00:26:57,323 --> 00:26:59,154
Mama...

374
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,489
...I'm so sorry.

375
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,857
There's nothing to be sorry about...

376
00:27:05,031 --> 00:27:08,330
...but if you want, we can just
forget this ever happened.

377
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:11,470
We can pack your bags
and get the hell out of here.

378
00:27:11,638 --> 00:27:15,540
Nino, I made a big batch of cannelloni.

379
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:19,838
How about it?
Come back home, <i>bello</i>.

380
00:27:22,115 --> 00:27:25,551
I am home, Mama. Angelo and...

381
00:27:26,286 --> 00:27:28,151
I'm gonna go now.

382
00:27:28,321 --> 00:27:30,789
You want some cannelloni,
you come with me.

383
00:27:30,957 --> 00:27:36,623
You want some disgusting,
mortal sin activity, you stay here.

384
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:41,993
Well, if it isn't the wife.

385
00:27:44,671 --> 00:27:48,437
- How are you, <i>Signora</i> Paventi?
- Oh, Nino...

386
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:53,409
...Iook at this beautiful face. Nice.

387
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,174
Now think of his big, fat mother...

388
00:27:56,349 --> 00:27:59,978
...because that's the face
you're going to end up with.

389
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:15,163
Oh, don't worry, Nino,
she'll come around.

390
00:28:17,804 --> 00:28:20,238
Hey, you'll never guess
what I did today.

391
00:28:20,406 --> 00:28:22,931
I went to the Gay Village.

392
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:30,349
I just went to see what it was like,
and I hated it. I hated it.

393
00:28:30,516 --> 00:28:34,213
But... Here, look what I found.

394
00:28:38,157 --> 00:28:41,615
There's a gay cop association
in Montreal. Isn't that great?

395
00:28:41,794 --> 00:28:44,592
- I don't want to be a gay anything.
- Are you kidding?

396
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,426
I would be a cop just to be
part of this association.

397
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,330
I know you mean well,
but please stop trying to help.

398
00:28:51,004 --> 00:28:52,938
Okay.

399
00:28:57,477 --> 00:29:01,345
It's been a rough day.
I'm going to bed.

400
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,244
Hey.

401
00:29:23,536 --> 00:29:27,666
My life basically consists of a series
of horror movies strung together.

402
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,809
And since my brother came out
everything is more horrific.

403
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,468
- And why is that?
- Because we're Italian.

404
00:29:34,047 --> 00:29:36,311
And can you believe that...

405
00:29:39,552 --> 00:29:43,010
- What?
...I'm the sane one in the family?

406
00:29:46,426 --> 00:29:48,291
I'm afraid our time is up.

407
00:29:50,763 --> 00:29:53,425
Let's discuss this
some more next week.

408
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:55,692
There's not gonna be a next week.

409
00:29:55,868 --> 00:29:58,530
- Why not?
- I never see a psychiatrist twice.

410
00:29:58,705 --> 00:30:00,900
- Never, <i>bella</i>?
- No, never.

411
00:30:01,074 --> 00:30:04,874
What? You know too much about me.
It's embarrassing.

412
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,822
- I did go to Pius X high school. Yes.
- Dino.

413
00:30:23,996 --> 00:30:25,020
- Nino.
- Mastronomo.

414
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:28,827
- Paventi.
- Of course, Nino Paventi. I'm stupid.

415
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:32,061
You were homecoming king
with my friend Gina Della Rovere.

416
00:30:32,238 --> 00:30:36,299
Gina. My God, it's been years.
How is Gina?

417
00:30:36,476 --> 00:30:38,603
Married.

418
00:30:38,778 --> 00:30:40,871
Two kids.

419
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:42,909
Two kids.

420
00:30:43,082 --> 00:30:47,610
- What's wrong?
- Me, I thought I would be married too.

421
00:30:49,822 --> 00:30:52,052
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.

422
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:56,189
Pina. Pina Lunetti.

423
00:30:56,662 --> 00:30:58,755
It's nice to meet you, Pina.

424
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,561
Oh, shit.

425
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:07,103
Lunetti.

426
00:31:07,273 --> 00:31:09,867
What to do you mean,
Moretti didn't show up?

427
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:14,138
Listen, the contract says today,
and I want them today...

428
00:31:14,313 --> 00:31:19,478
...so if Moretti doesn't show up with
his doors, it's his ass along with yours.

429
00:31:19,652 --> 00:31:22,450
Good. Shit.

430
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,349
Come, I was about to leave too.

431
00:31:25,525 --> 00:31:29,393
When my father had his heart attack
he was forced to retire, so I took over.

432
00:31:29,562 --> 00:31:31,689
- You run this company by yourself?
- Yep.

433
00:31:31,864 --> 00:31:34,389
- You, you're not married?
- Me? No, no.

434
00:31:34,967 --> 00:31:37,595
How come?
All the girls said...

435
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,500
...you'd be the first to marry
because you're a hunk.

436
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,873
- Thanks.
- So...

437
00:31:44,043 --> 00:31:45,738
...what do you do?
- I'm a cop.

438
00:31:51,517 --> 00:31:53,314
So...

439
00:31:53,853 --> 00:31:56,014
...aren't you gonna invite me over?

440
00:31:56,189 --> 00:31:58,749
We could talk some more.

441
00:32:01,561 --> 00:32:03,961
I'm gonna have to pass.

442
00:32:05,731 --> 00:32:07,460
Look...

443
00:32:08,901 --> 00:32:12,268
...my numbers are on the card.
Call me sometime, okay?

444
00:32:12,638 --> 00:32:14,333
Okay.

445
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,942
Anna.

446
00:32:26,185 --> 00:32:29,643
Anna! Get some <i>camomilla</i>
for your father.

447
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,287
Okay.

448
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:34,856
Again with your stomach?

449
00:32:35,294 --> 00:32:38,354
I feel like somebody lit a match
and then put it up in here.

450
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:41,056
Oh, I don't know how much
more I can take, Mari.

451
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:47,166
- You just need to keep calm.
- Calm? How can I keep calm?

452
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,036
My life is one big disappointment
after another.

453
00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:53,906
That's all you know how to do, feel
sorry about how your life turned out.

454
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,947
You think I'm having
such a great time here?

455
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,550
Mari.

456
00:33:01,988 --> 00:33:05,185
Angelo, we still love him?

457
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,258
Of course we still love him.

458
00:33:07,693 --> 00:33:10,287
He's still our beautiful Angelo.

459
00:33:10,463 --> 00:33:13,626
If Angelo
is still our beautiful Angelo...

460
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,227
...will you tell me...

461
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:20,870
...why is so hard to pick up the phone
and call him up?

462
00:33:21,908 --> 00:33:23,637
I don't know, Gi.

463
00:33:24,343 --> 00:33:25,833
Mari...

464
00:33:26,012 --> 00:33:29,812
I don't know, Gi. I just don't know.

465
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:59,601
Why, Ruta Lee, I do declare.

466
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:02,976
I have never seen you
looking so peaked in your entire life.

467
00:34:03,149 --> 00:34:06,710
Your engagement to Brent
isn't agreeing with you at all, is it?

468
00:34:06,886 --> 00:34:10,913
Jolene, I don't know what you're
babbling. Brent and I are crazy in love.

469
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,558
Then why am I carrying his child?

470
00:34:13,726 --> 00:34:16,126
Why, that is the sickest lie
I ever did hear.

471
00:34:16,295 --> 00:34:18,763
Now, I think you owe me an apology!

472
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,832
I know my mom and your mom
go back a long way, but your script...

473
00:34:25,004 --> 00:34:28,098
...what can I say? Worst piece of shit
I ever read in my life.

474
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,868
And believe me, I know shit.
I produce plenty of it.

475
00:34:31,043 --> 00:34:33,637
The Civil War? What the fuck
do you know about that?

476
00:34:33,813 --> 00:34:36,008
Were you a fucking slave
in a previous life?

477
00:34:36,182 --> 00:34:38,377
Or perhaps you were
Abraham-fucking-Lincoln?

478
00:34:38,551 --> 00:34:40,485
Or maybe you were
a Southern belle...

479
00:34:40,653 --> 00:34:43,087
...with the big hoop skirt
and weird accent!

480
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:47,919
If I was you, I'd quit while I was ahead
and forget about writing altogether.

481
00:34:48,094 --> 00:34:50,858
So how's your ma?

482
00:34:51,864 --> 00:34:54,424
- Good.
- Good.

483
00:35:21,894 --> 00:35:23,862
Lina.

484
00:35:35,574 --> 00:35:38,668
- Your husband's looking good.
- Thanks.

485
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,809
- So have you spoken to...?
- No. You?

486
00:35:44,984 --> 00:35:46,246
Me neither.

487
00:35:46,419 --> 00:35:49,752
Listen, Maria, what the kids
are going through, it's just a phase!

488
00:35:49,922 --> 00:35:52,982
I hear a lot of guys go through that
when they're teenagers.

489
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:56,219
- Lina, they're grown men.
- They're late, that's all.

490
00:35:56,962 --> 00:35:59,954
I'm thinking we should have
a dinner party at your place.

491
00:36:00,132 --> 00:36:03,397
You provide the food, I'll bring
this nice Italian girl I know.

492
00:36:03,569 --> 00:36:06,197
- What for?
- For Angelo!

493
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:09,273
- Anna, is she seeing anyone?
- No.

494
00:36:09,442 --> 00:36:11,910
Good. She's perfect for Nino.

495
00:36:12,078 --> 00:36:15,775
Well, if he could fall for the brother,
he could fall for the sister, no?

496
00:36:15,948 --> 00:36:19,042
- No offense, but this sounds crazy.
- No offense taken.

497
00:36:19,418 --> 00:36:21,249
Is a week from Saturday
good for you?

498
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,583
- Yes.
- Good. A week from Saturday it is.

499
00:36:24,757 --> 00:36:28,591
Oh, I'm so happy
we're friends again!

500
00:36:32,832 --> 00:36:35,096
I've been meaning
to tell you something.

501
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:38,532
- What?
- Your friend, the guy you live with?

502
00:36:38,704 --> 00:36:40,365
- Angelo?
- Yeah, him.

503
00:36:40,539 --> 00:36:43,997
You know me, I don't listen to gossip,
but my girlfriend's sister...

504
00:36:44,176 --> 00:36:49,910
...has a cousin who works with him,
and let me tell you, everyone's talking.

505
00:36:50,382 --> 00:36:52,816
- About what?
- About...

506
00:36:52,985 --> 00:36:57,081
Don't get me wrong, I don't have
anything against those people.

507
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:00,955
- Travel agents?
- No, you know.

508
00:37:01,127 --> 00:37:03,027
Fags.

509
00:37:05,865 --> 00:37:07,765
Angelo isn't a fag.

510
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:13,261
Even if he was,
I don't see how it concerns you.

511
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,532
I'll tell you how it concerns me.

512
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:19,303
You live with the guy and you spend
the rest of your time with me.

513
00:37:19,478 --> 00:37:23,676
If they start talking queer
about you, me?

514
00:37:23,983 --> 00:37:26,417
I'm changing partners.

515
00:37:36,962 --> 00:37:38,623
- Hey.
- Hey.

516
00:37:38,998 --> 00:37:41,694
- I didn't think you were gonna call me.
- Why not?

517
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:46,370
Because of the stupid way I acted last
time, bawling my eyes out like an idiot.

518
00:37:46,539 --> 00:37:49,007
I don't think you acted stupid.

519
00:38:16,702 --> 00:38:19,671
Hey. How did your meeting
with Christofaro go?

520
00:38:20,272 --> 00:38:21,967
Don't ask.

521
00:38:22,141 --> 00:38:24,041
That good?

522
00:38:45,965 --> 00:38:47,227
It's funny, you know?

523
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:50,197
No matter how much I blame
my parents for my neuroses...

524
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:53,031
...all my happiest memories
are with them.

525
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,968
Family vacations...

526
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,166
...weddings, Sunday get-togethers...

527
00:39:07,686 --> 00:39:09,745
<i>What chaos!</i>

528
00:39:09,955 --> 00:39:13,447
<i>What beautiful, serene chaos.</i>

529
00:39:13,993 --> 00:39:16,985
I think the problem
with us Italians is that...

530
00:39:17,162 --> 00:39:20,359
...when we leave our world
to go into the real world...

531
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:24,366
...there's nothing serene
about the chaos we encounter.

532
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,936
When people scream at you...

533
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,639
...they're really screaming at you!

534
00:39:30,009 --> 00:39:31,636
Why you so sad?

535
00:39:32,211 --> 00:39:34,042
Because...

536
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,608
...the other night there was
a little reunion supper at my house.

537
00:39:40,552 --> 00:39:42,986
There was plenty of chaos.

538
00:39:43,455 --> 00:39:46,754
For the first time, there was
nothing serene about it.

539
00:39:57,236 --> 00:40:00,899
So, Nino, do you think the Canadiens
have a chance this year?

540
00:40:01,473 --> 00:40:02,735
I have no idea, really.

541
00:40:03,175 --> 00:40:06,167
- He's not interested in hockey.
- Oh, I'm very interested.

542
00:40:06,345 --> 00:40:08,176
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

543
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,974
Nino played right through university.
He was always the star player.

544
00:40:14,086 --> 00:40:16,884
So I guess hockey
is not the answer, Gino?

545
00:40:19,258 --> 00:40:23,024
So are we gonna have the big
discussion before or after supper?

546
00:40:23,195 --> 00:40:26,687
- Discuss? What's to discuss?
- We'll have a pleasant evening.

547
00:40:26,865 --> 00:40:31,598
Oh, yes. A pleasant evening. If we
don't talk about it, it doesn't exist.

548
00:40:32,004 --> 00:40:34,097
- Angelo.
- I'll get it!

549
00:40:37,943 --> 00:40:39,911
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

550
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,674
- How's it going?
- Good, good.

551
00:40:45,184 --> 00:40:47,175
- Gino.
- Lina.

552
00:40:47,419 --> 00:40:50,411
<i>Buona sera</i>, everybody, <i>buona</i>...

553
00:40:50,589 --> 00:40:53,956
Anna! <i>Sempre cosi bella</i>.

554
00:40:54,126 --> 00:40:56,924
Always so gorgeous.

555
00:40:57,096 --> 00:40:58,495
Look at you.

556
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:04,000
Look at her, Nino,
so young, so beautiful!

557
00:41:06,872 --> 00:41:08,601
Angelo.

558
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:13,978
Well. What a handsome young man
you turned out to be.

559
00:41:16,148 --> 00:41:18,708
Are you sure he's not adopted?

560
00:41:23,589 --> 00:41:26,956
So, Nino, why you don't call?

561
00:41:27,126 --> 00:41:30,653
How come you never call
your <i>povera</i> old mama?

562
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:33,491
- Because I'm scared.
- Oh, you joker.

563
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:36,395
- Where's your friend?
- She's parking the car.

564
00:41:36,568 --> 00:41:40,561
Everybody, I hope you don't mind
I brought a friend along.

565
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:44,436
All by herself
on a Saturday night.

566
00:41:49,148 --> 00:41:50,445
Come on in, doll.

567
00:41:52,217 --> 00:41:53,707
- <i>Buona sera.</i>
- <i>Buona sera.</i>

568
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,787
- Everyone, this is...
- Nino?

569
00:41:57,689 --> 00:41:59,884
- Pina.
- You two know each other?

570
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,321
Yeah, Nino and me...

571
00:42:01,493 --> 00:42:04,087
- We went to the same high school.
- Same high school.

572
00:42:04,263 --> 00:42:06,754
- That's not too far from here.
- Good old Pius X.

573
00:42:06,932 --> 00:42:09,298
- You went to Pius too?
- Unfortunately.

574
00:42:09,468 --> 00:42:10,901
Thank you.

575
00:42:11,103 --> 00:42:13,663
What...? Then I should know you.
Don't tell me.

576
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,171
Angelo. Angelo Barberini.

577
00:42:20,145 --> 00:42:21,874
The fag?

578
00:42:24,183 --> 00:42:27,175
My past has come back
to haunt me.

579
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,284
Who knew it had such big hair.

580
00:42:29,455 --> 00:42:32,219
This is the nice man
you wanted me to meet? The fag?

581
00:42:32,391 --> 00:42:34,484
- Meet?
- Pina, honey, I didn't know.

582
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,128
- All of Pius knew.
- What's going on here?

583
00:42:37,296 --> 00:42:40,993
- Yeah, what is going on?
- We'll have a pleasant evening.

584
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:43,157
- I'm going home.
- No, you stay here.

585
00:42:43,335 --> 00:42:44,768
The roast is almost ready.

586
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,201
- Come on, Nino, let's go.
- Hold on. Go where?

587
00:42:47,372 --> 00:42:49,738
- None of your business.
- Nino is my business.

588
00:42:49,908 --> 00:42:51,273
What does he mean by that?

589
00:42:51,543 --> 00:42:54,535
- The roast is ready.
- Come on, <i>mangiamo</i>. Let's go.

590
00:42:54,713 --> 00:42:57,238
Nino, tell her what I mean by that.

591
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,477
- We'll discuss this some other time.
- Why? What happened in the car...

592
00:43:01,653 --> 00:43:03,416
...that was all pretend?
- Pina.

593
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:05,557
- What happened in the car?
- What car?

594
00:43:05,724 --> 00:43:06,713
- His car.
- Our car?

595
00:43:06,892 --> 00:43:10,225
- Your car?
- Your car, his car, who cares?

596
00:43:10,395 --> 00:43:14,422
- What did you do in the damn car?
- We made love!

597
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,635
Yes!

598
00:43:23,742 --> 00:43:27,508
Yes! Yes! Yes!

599
00:43:34,052 --> 00:43:36,043
- You're a fucking liar!
- Oh, yeah?

600
00:43:36,555 --> 00:43:37,817
Tell him, Nino.

601
00:43:38,357 --> 00:43:40,052
Nino?

602
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,259
You brought this on yourself.

603
00:43:45,564 --> 00:43:47,589
- What?
- Yeah. You and your coming out!

604
00:43:47,766 --> 00:43:49,927
- Coming out from where?
- A phase.

605
00:43:50,102 --> 00:43:52,502
Again with this "phase."
Your son is gay.

606
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,138
Angelo!

607
00:43:55,207 --> 00:43:57,334
I don't want this anymore.

608
00:43:57,643 --> 00:44:01,101
Okay? You're just gonna
have to deal with that.

609
00:44:02,047 --> 00:44:06,074
- Don't you want me? Us? What?
- Oh, God, I think I'm gonna be sick.

610
00:44:08,453 --> 00:44:09,977
Let's just go home, okay?

611
00:44:11,623 --> 00:44:15,184
Nino, let's just go... Come on,
let's just go home, it'll be fine!

612
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,157
Back off!

613
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,425
I don't want this.

614
00:44:19,898 --> 00:44:22,025
What is going on here?

615
00:44:22,501 --> 00:44:25,402
- My God! What is going on here?
- Leave him be, Angelo.

616
00:44:25,571 --> 00:44:28,597
This is not some kid who doesn't
wanna play with me anymore.

617
00:44:28,774 --> 00:44:31,334
- This is my love...
- <i>Basta</i>!

618
00:44:33,378 --> 00:44:37,178
I don't want this anymore, Angelo.
Understood?

619
00:44:42,087 --> 00:44:44,180
Were you in on this?

620
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:46,685
Were you all in on this?

621
00:44:47,793 --> 00:44:50,227
You're welcome
to move back with us anytime.

622
00:44:50,395 --> 00:44:53,455
You could come even tonight,
if you wanted.

623
00:44:53,966 --> 00:44:56,457
What a comfort.

624
00:44:56,935 --> 00:45:00,132
No, I've done my time.
So you can forget about it.

625
00:45:00,372 --> 00:45:02,135
- Time?
- What time?

626
00:45:02,307 --> 00:45:04,832
I spent almost 30 years
in this prison.

627
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:09,640
This prison of guilt and fear and lies
and I'm not about to come back.

628
00:45:10,315 --> 00:45:13,250
- Angelo, I think that's enough.
- That's right.

629
00:45:13,418 --> 00:45:14,749
Pa is rubbing his stomach.

630
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:18,818
I wouldn't wanna trigger
one of his psychosomatic attacks.

631
00:45:18,991 --> 00:45:20,788
You think this...

632
00:45:20,959 --> 00:45:23,154
I wouldn't wish this pain
on my worst enemy.

633
00:45:23,328 --> 00:45:26,695
Are you paying close attention,
Nino? Are you?

634
00:45:26,865 --> 00:45:29,197
Because this is gonna be your life
in 20 years.

635
00:45:29,368 --> 00:45:31,700
- Enough, Angelo.
- What's wrong with our lives?

636
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:34,361
Where would you like me to start?

637
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:37,997
The only worthwhile thing you did
was leave that spit of a village...

638
00:45:38,176 --> 00:45:40,235
...of yours in Italy to come here.

639
00:45:40,412 --> 00:45:42,346
But you never really left, did you?

640
00:45:42,514 --> 00:45:45,039
When you came,
you brought that village with you...

641
00:45:45,217 --> 00:45:47,913
...and dropped it on your houses
like a ton of bricks.

642
00:45:48,687 --> 00:45:52,418
And then, even after coming all this
way, you spent 30, 40 years...

643
00:45:52,591 --> 00:45:56,857
...reminiscing about your stupid lives
in that spit of a village!

644
00:45:57,029 --> 00:45:58,462
Oh, that's it.

645
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,693
Cry, Ma.

646
00:46:01,366 --> 00:46:02,731
Cry.

647
00:46:02,901 --> 00:46:07,463
Because unlike Pa, I want to
inflict my pain on all of you.

648
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,903
It's stronger than my guilt right now.

649
00:46:10,409 --> 00:46:12,138
So cry.

650
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:16,008
Cry over your ingrate son,
over your dead sister...

651
00:46:16,181 --> 00:46:18,149
...or your stupid, worthless life.

652
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:20,247
Angelo, that's enough!

653
00:46:28,493 --> 00:46:30,290
And there we have it.

654
00:46:31,863 --> 00:46:33,626
The slap.

655
00:46:34,399 --> 00:46:38,130
The end to the quintessential
Italian melodrama.

656
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:44,199
It's been a lovely evening,
but I really must go.

657
00:46:44,376 --> 00:46:48,642
I hope you all enjoy your lives
in your respective cocoons.

658
00:46:49,448 --> 00:46:53,976
If any of you would like to get in touch
with me, I'll be living in the real world.

659
00:46:57,322 --> 00:47:00,985
Oh, but first,
there's one thing that I must do.

660
00:47:03,628 --> 00:47:05,186
God help us.

661
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,161
It's real.

662
00:47:12,437 --> 00:47:14,997
I always wanted big hair like hers.

663
00:47:18,009 --> 00:47:19,874
Nino.

664
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:22,444
Pina's on the phone.

665
00:47:22,781 --> 00:47:25,272
Nino, she's called about
a million times.

666
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:27,179
When are you going to talk to her?

667
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:33,520
You should see this chick,
she's freaking gorgeous.

668
00:47:33,692 --> 00:47:36,525
She's hot, but more than that,
she's a classy broad.

669
00:47:36,695 --> 00:47:38,595
Where you gonna find
a classy broad?

670
00:47:38,764 --> 00:47:43,463
She dresses good, knows how to
handle herself in public. Smart too.

671
00:47:57,149 --> 00:48:00,346
Dear Father, I've been coming here
every Saturday afternoon...

672
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:02,919
...for the last 30 years.
- <i>Si, si, si</i>.

673
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:06,922
At 2:45 p.m., after you finish
the vacuuming...

674
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,219
...and while the tomato sauce
is simmering.

675
00:48:10,862 --> 00:48:13,695
But today I came here
to ask for a miracle.

676
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:17,595
You see, Father, I agreed to put
a stupid scheme in motion...

677
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:20,260
...and now my entire family
is torn apart.

678
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:23,139
What did you do now, Maria?

679
00:48:23,308 --> 00:48:25,742
I tried to set my son
up with some <i>puttana</i>.

680
00:48:26,344 --> 00:48:27,936
Pardon my language.

681
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:31,076
- Go on, my child.
- And I don't know if I could ever...

682
00:48:31,249 --> 00:48:34,309
...forgive my son for all the things
he said to me.

683
00:48:34,486 --> 00:48:36,078
But I want him to be cured.

684
00:48:36,388 --> 00:48:40,722
I need this miracle,
so in return I must forgive him.

685
00:48:40,892 --> 00:48:45,556
- Is your son gravely ill?
- No. He's gravely gay.

686
00:48:46,698 --> 00:48:49,394
<i>Dear Nino,</i>
<i>this is the only way I can think of...</i>

687
00:48:49,568 --> 00:48:52,765
<i>... that I might be able to reach you.</i>
<i>So I ask you...</i>

688
00:48:52,938 --> 00:48:55,338
<i>... read this through</i>
<i>before closing your mind.</i>

689
00:48:55,507 --> 00:48:57,737
<i>Before shutting me out forever.</i>

690
00:49:10,355 --> 00:49:14,587
<i>Keeping my love for you a secret</i>
<i>seemed like a betrayal of that love.</i>

691
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:17,995
<i>I was so drunk and delirious</i>
<i>on the hope you brought me...</i>

692
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:21,428
<i>... I lost sight of its source</i>
<i>and I betrayed you instead.</i>

693
00:49:24,302 --> 00:49:27,237
<i>Now I know that I don't need</i>
<i>anyone else to know about us.</i>

694
00:49:27,405 --> 00:49:30,431
<i>We are enough. And even if a closet</i>
<i>must protect our love...</i>

695
00:49:30,609 --> 00:49:31,940
<i>... it won't contain it.</i>

696
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:36,079
Nino. <i>Bello</i>!

697
00:49:36,248 --> 00:49:38,682
Guess who called today?

698
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:11,549
<i>I would do anything</i>
<i>to make things right again.</i>

699
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:14,617
<i>There is no one</i>
<i>if there isn't you, Nino.</i>

700
00:50:14,953 --> 00:50:18,081
<i>When you left, everything</i>
<i>stopped making sense.</i>

701
00:50:19,024 --> 00:50:22,516
<i>I love you, Nino,</i>
<i>and I can't bear to be without you.</i>

702
00:50:23,328 --> 00:50:25,228
<i>Your Angelo.</i>

703
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:35,672
Hey, it's me.

704
00:50:36,841 --> 00:50:39,435
I know I should have called you
before, but...

705
00:50:39,945 --> 00:50:41,344
...can we meet?

706
00:51:50,215 --> 00:51:51,739
So how's your writing going?

707
00:51:54,019 --> 00:51:55,486
Never better.

708
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:57,053
I gave up.

709
00:52:05,096 --> 00:52:07,462
- How are you, Angelo?
- Good.

710
00:52:07,632 --> 00:52:10,533
No, Angelo, how are you really feeling,
you know?

711
00:52:10,702 --> 00:52:12,533
What's the matter with you?

712
00:52:12,704 --> 00:52:15,639
Nothing! What? A sister
can't try to help out her brother?

713
00:52:15,807 --> 00:52:18,105
Since when do we
help each other out?

714
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:24,573
Okay, we're going out.

715
00:52:24,749 --> 00:52:26,512
- Going out?
- It makes perfect sense.

716
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:30,382
You need to meet some new people
to replace the ones you lost.

717
00:52:30,555 --> 00:52:32,887
- Let's go dancing.
- Anna, you know I hate bars.

718
00:52:33,058 --> 00:52:35,993
- Because you've never been with me.
- Forget about it!

719
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:39,460
Okay. We won't go to a bar.
We're gonna go to...

720
00:52:39,631 --> 00:52:41,895
We're gonna go to...

721
00:52:43,001 --> 00:52:47,267
There's gotta be one gay place in this
city filled with boring people like you!

722
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:51,669
Hi, my name is Steve and I wanna
volunteer at Gay Helpline...

723
00:52:51,843 --> 00:52:53,708
...because I'm from a small town...

724
00:52:53,878 --> 00:52:58,577
...and there was no one for me
to call when I was a teenager.

725
00:52:58,883 --> 00:53:02,046
And I wanna thank Gay Helpline
for giving me the opportunity...

726
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:06,680
...to be that someone
that teenagers can call.

727
00:53:06,858 --> 00:53:08,553
Thank you.

728
00:53:10,528 --> 00:53:12,223
That's great, man.

729
00:53:14,365 --> 00:53:16,333
Yeah, I'm Alicia...

730
00:53:16,501 --> 00:53:20,130
...and I wanna join Gay Helpline...

731
00:53:20,305 --> 00:53:24,264
...because if I could prevent
just one gay teen...

732
00:53:24,442 --> 00:53:27,104
...from putting a bullet
through his head...

733
00:53:27,378 --> 00:53:31,610
...and make him stand up and shout,
"I'm gay. Gay!

734
00:53:31,783 --> 00:53:35,048
And if you don't like it,
you can all go fuck yourselves...

735
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,211
...you twisted motherfuckers!"...

736
00:53:39,691 --> 00:53:40,953
...then I'll be happy.

737
00:53:49,134 --> 00:53:50,761
Hi.

738
00:53:51,136 --> 00:53:52,797
My name is Angelo...

739
00:53:52,971 --> 00:53:54,529
...and...

740
00:53:54,706 --> 00:53:57,539
...I'm Italian.

741
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:00,904
And why do I wanna
volunteer here?

742
00:54:01,146 --> 00:54:03,614
Good question. Let's see.

743
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,776
I've been going through
a very hard time...

744
00:54:08,953 --> 00:54:11,114
...and I've been in the closet
all my life.

745
00:54:11,656 --> 00:54:14,784
So I wanna meet other gay people...

746
00:54:14,959 --> 00:54:18,918
...but not the ones who hang out
in the bars or in the Village.

747
00:54:19,397 --> 00:54:22,059
I called here once and the guy
sounded really cool...

748
00:54:22,233 --> 00:54:25,794
...so I thought this might be
a good place to make gay friends.

749
00:54:26,938 --> 00:54:29,031
So long as they're not effeminate.

750
00:54:29,207 --> 00:54:31,175
Keep those away from me.

751
00:54:35,213 --> 00:54:38,740
And I wanna help
stop gay teen suicide.

752
00:54:40,518 --> 00:54:43,885
You know, something tells me I didn't
make a good first impression.

753
00:54:44,055 --> 00:54:46,353
Forget about it. Just try to relax.

754
00:54:46,524 --> 00:54:49,652
Now, do you prefer headsets
or a regular phone?

755
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:52,854
- Well, I'm quite good with these.
- Okay.

756
00:54:54,365 --> 00:54:56,925
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

757
00:54:57,101 --> 00:55:00,127
- It's normal to be nervous the first time.
- Nervous? No, no.

758
00:55:00,305 --> 00:55:04,036
This isn't nervous, this is petrified.

759
00:55:04,209 --> 00:55:05,471
You'll do fine.

760
00:55:07,545 --> 00:55:10,776
Remember, the callers need
to feel that what they're saying...

761
00:55:10,949 --> 00:55:13,850
...is not falling on deaf ears. Okay?
- Okay.

762
00:55:14,018 --> 00:55:16,282
We're not here to give advice
or to judge.

763
00:55:16,454 --> 00:55:18,046
No judging.

764
00:55:18,223 --> 00:55:20,123
Then what's the point?

765
00:55:23,828 --> 00:55:26,763
So do you do this often?

766
00:55:26,931 --> 00:55:28,922
Every Saturday afternoon
like clockwork.

767
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,295
You enjoy listening
to people's problems?

768
00:55:31,469 --> 00:55:35,462
Well, it gets me out of my head
and it's a great way to relax.

769
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:39,736
Actually, I started doing it because,
like you, I don't like bars...

770
00:55:39,911 --> 00:55:42,505
...and I wanted to meet
interesting people.

771
00:55:43,081 --> 00:55:46,915
- Have you met any?
- Not until today.

772
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:50,885
- You ready?
- No.

773
00:55:51,055 --> 00:55:52,579
Yes, you are. Go.

774
00:55:53,091 --> 00:55:55,116
Hello. Gay Helpline,
how may I help you?

775
00:55:55,293 --> 00:55:58,888
My parents will kill me if I say
I'm a fag. I can't go on this way!

776
00:55:59,063 --> 00:56:01,054
- Don't tell them.
- But it's killing me.

777
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:02,893
- Then tell them.
- They'll kill me.

778
00:56:03,067 --> 00:56:06,662
Then you've got nothing to lose,
because either way you're dead, right?

779
00:56:07,372 --> 00:56:08,930
Hello?

780
00:56:09,107 --> 00:56:10,836
Hello?

781
00:56:14,012 --> 00:56:16,640
I guess humor is out of the question.

782
00:56:17,982 --> 00:56:21,509
- Just listen and try and feel their pain.
- Feel their pain.

783
00:56:21,686 --> 00:56:25,554
Yes. If someone calls and says,
"Things are really bad right now"...

784
00:56:25,723 --> 00:56:29,625
...you answer, full of compassion,
"Things are really bad right now, huh?"

785
00:56:30,128 --> 00:56:32,255
- Okay?
- Got it.

786
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,330
<i>Gay Helpline, how may I help you?</i>

787
00:56:34,499 --> 00:56:36,933
I never should've taken
those illegal hormones.

788
00:56:37,101 --> 00:56:40,127
You never should have taken
those illegal hormones, huh?

789
00:56:40,305 --> 00:56:42,933
- I'm really depressed.
- You're really depressed, huh?

790
00:56:43,107 --> 00:56:46,804
I don't want the sex change. I'm stuck
with small breasts, a low voice...

791
00:56:46,978 --> 00:56:49,208
...and I can't get an erection.

792
00:56:50,515 --> 00:56:53,450
You're stuck with small breasts
and a low voice...

793
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:57,816
...and you can't get an erection, huh?

794
00:56:57,989 --> 00:57:00,617
- I ruined my life.
- No kidding!

795
00:57:01,059 --> 00:57:02,754
I mean...

796
00:57:04,028 --> 00:57:06,622
...you ruined your life, huh?
- What's so funny?

797
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,323
Nothing. Nothing.

798
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:12,702
You're gonna be fine.
Don't worry about the breasts.

799
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:14,997
Don't worry about the small...

800
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,202
...erection.

801
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:18,637
Things are fine, right?

802
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,745
You just gotta play around
a little bit with it all. Okay?

803
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:28,380
I can't do this.

804
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,884
I sent three letters, no response.

805
00:57:31,055 --> 00:57:33,546
But I can tell she's
madly in love with me too.

806
00:57:33,725 --> 00:57:36,319
You've written her three love letters...

807
00:57:36,561 --> 00:57:38,654
...and she...

808
00:57:40,231 --> 00:57:43,064
Look, lady, I'm really sorry,
but I can't help you.

809
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:45,564
<i>Okay? I thought I could, but I can't.</i>

810
00:57:45,737 --> 00:57:48,570
So I suggest you hang up
and call back when someone...

811
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,935
...much more competent
than me can help you.

812
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:53,907
Is this the Gay Help Center?
Do I have the wrong number?

813
00:57:54,078 --> 00:57:56,842
- This is Gay Helpline.
- Why aren't you gay helping me?

814
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,678
- Because I told you, I'm no good.
- You're great! I feel better already!

815
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,183
- No, you don't.
- <i>Yes, I do.</i>

816
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:07,222
- You've got a calming kind of voice.
- I don't have a calming anything.

817
00:58:07,392 --> 00:58:10,088
So I suggest you hang up
and call back later, okay?

818
00:58:10,261 --> 00:58:12,923
No, I'm gonna stay on for
a lot longer.

819
00:58:13,097 --> 00:58:15,429
- No! I want you to hang up.
- I'm not gonna.

820
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,760
- Hang up.
- No!

821
00:58:16,934 --> 00:58:18,162
- Hang up!
- You first!

822
00:58:18,336 --> 00:58:20,031
Fine.

823
00:58:20,204 --> 00:58:21,637
Hello?

824
00:58:21,806 --> 00:58:23,364
Hello?

825
00:58:23,808 --> 00:58:25,241
Gay Helpline?

826
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:29,437
- I guess I'm not helpline material.
- Active listening is not for everyone.

827
00:58:29,614 --> 00:58:31,548
Well, I've got years
of non-experience.

828
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:35,117
Talking and not listening
is an Italian tradition.

829
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,545
Let me ask you something.

830
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:42,056
Do you think you're helping those
callers by going so easy on them?

831
00:58:42,226 --> 00:58:45,491
- What do you mean?
- Well, take me, for example.

832
00:58:45,663 --> 00:58:49,292
Now, I came out of the closet knowing
that my boyfriend didn't want to.

833
00:58:49,467 --> 00:58:53,130
Do I need to hear,
"Oh, your boyfriend left you?"

834
00:58:53,304 --> 00:58:59,573
No. I need someone to tell me, "Next
time, think twice before you fuck up."

835
00:59:00,111 --> 00:59:03,080
Angelo, if you can't have compassion
for yourself...

836
00:59:03,247 --> 00:59:05,875
...how you gonna have it for others?

837
00:59:07,351 --> 00:59:09,046
Right.

838
00:59:09,787 --> 00:59:11,982
- I gotta go.
- Hey, listen. Do you wanna...

839
00:59:12,156 --> 00:59:14,420
...go for a beer or something?
- What for?

840
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:17,322
To lecture you more about the benefits
of compassion.

841
00:59:17,495 --> 00:59:19,019
- You wanna convert me?
- Maybe.

842
00:59:19,197 --> 00:59:21,427
- I'm a hopeless case.
- I know you are.

843
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,227
But I love a good challenge.

844
00:59:24,502 --> 00:59:26,231
You do?

845
00:59:28,506 --> 00:59:30,906
That's the best offer
I've had in a long time...

846
00:59:31,075 --> 00:59:34,943
...but after all that active non-listening,
I'm really drained...

847
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:37,604
...so I'm gonna have to pass.
- Okay.

848
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:40,114
But if you change your mind...

849
00:59:40,284 --> 00:59:42,013
...you know where to find me.

850
00:59:42,186 --> 00:59:44,381
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.

851
00:59:59,937 --> 01:00:01,905
Gino.

852
01:00:02,373 --> 01:00:04,000
Gino.

853
01:00:04,175 --> 01:00:07,167
- Gino!
- I wasn't asleep.

854
01:00:07,345 --> 01:00:09,870
Must you fall asleep
every time we visit my sister?

855
01:00:10,047 --> 01:00:11,981
What does she care?
She's dead already.

856
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,913
Don't be rude!

857
01:00:21,559 --> 01:00:23,686
Angelo and Yolanda...

858
01:00:23,861 --> 01:00:25,726
...one of a kind.

859
01:00:25,897 --> 01:00:27,558
How do you mean?

860
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:31,267
She wanted to be different too.

861
01:00:31,435 --> 01:00:34,131
But we were so afraid for her.

862
01:00:34,772 --> 01:00:37,434
Scared if she chased her dream
of being an actress...

863
01:00:37,608 --> 01:00:39,974
...she would end up in a bad way.

864
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:43,480
And look where she ended up at 33.

865
01:00:43,781 --> 01:00:45,612
Bunch of idiots we were!

866
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:50,987
Kept on feeding her pills to calm
her down instead of letting her fly.

867
01:00:51,155 --> 01:00:54,716
Then one day she flew
straight into the river.

868
01:00:54,892 --> 01:00:57,486
What a way of giving us all the finger.

869
01:00:57,662 --> 01:01:00,187
Mari, that was accident.

870
01:01:00,364 --> 01:01:03,492
No, it was no accident, Gi.
No accident.

871
01:01:03,668 --> 01:01:07,331
And now I realize all the mistakes
I made with my baby sister...

872
01:01:07,505 --> 01:01:10,099
...I repeated them with my son.
- No, no, no.

873
01:01:10,274 --> 01:01:13,710
- It was all my fault, Gi.
- No, no, no, no.

874
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:17,279
The only thing is your fault,
you make me happy man.

875
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:26,053
Take care, Yolanda.

876
01:01:34,031 --> 01:01:36,659
Let's go home? Come on.

877
01:01:43,474 --> 01:01:47,103
Yes, I apologize, but...
I know your client is in the U. K...

878
01:01:47,278 --> 01:01:50,736
...but you didn't say "Glasgow,"
you insisted on New Glasgow.

879
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:53,281
That's north of Montreal.
So I chartered a bus.

880
01:01:53,451 --> 01:01:55,851
<i>I say New Glasgow.</i>
<i>You misunderstood.</i>

881
01:01:56,020 --> 01:02:00,582
I don't mean to be confrontational, but
there is no New Glasgow in Scotland.

882
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:03,727
Well, no, they don't need a new one,
they have the old one.

883
01:02:03,894 --> 01:02:06,658
It's actually quite simple.
You see, many years ago...

884
01:02:06,831 --> 01:02:10,426
...people from Glasgow,
Glasconians, left the old Glasgow...

885
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:13,365
...and they came here.
And they built a new Glasgow.

886
01:02:13,537 --> 01:02:16,404
And they called it New Glasgow
because it was new.

887
01:02:16,574 --> 01:02:20,374
According to theoretical physics,
eventually we'll be able to fold space...

888
01:02:20,544 --> 01:02:23,479
...so that the new Glasgow
will overlap the old Glasgow...

889
01:02:23,648 --> 01:02:27,778
...enabling us to travel between the
two without moving in time or space.

890
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:31,683
But until then, let me assure you
that they are quite different places.

891
01:02:32,023 --> 01:02:35,686
Did I mention that New Glasgow
just got waterslides? Those are fun.

892
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:41,223
- <i>everybody. I'm taking you to</i>
<i>court. Understand? You there? Hey!</i>

893
01:02:58,349 --> 01:03:02,183
What are you all dressed up for?
You're not going anywhere.

894
01:03:08,092 --> 01:03:11,926
Listen, Johnny, I really wanna work
in TV. Any job would do.

895
01:03:12,096 --> 01:03:15,429
Fuck, I can't hire you to clean
the fucking toilets around here.

896
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:18,261
I had to lay off about a million people
yesterday.

897
01:03:18,436 --> 01:03:19,733
Things are bad, Angelo.

898
01:03:20,404 --> 01:03:22,929
Between you and me?
My last series didn't fly.

899
01:03:23,107 --> 01:03:26,668
I could be on the street soon.
Imagine, a fucking bag man!

900
01:03:28,879 --> 01:03:30,141
What about you?

901
01:03:30,314 --> 01:03:33,010
- You gave up writing?
- Yeah.

902
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,742
That's too bad.

903
01:03:34,919 --> 01:03:39,447
But listen, if you ever come up with
an idea for a series, give me a call.

904
01:03:39,623 --> 01:03:41,750
So long as it's not about
the Civil War.

905
01:03:42,126 --> 01:03:45,823
Write about stuff you know. You're
young. Write about young people.

906
01:03:45,996 --> 01:03:49,329
You know, good-Iooking, bikinis,
tans, abs, boobs, everything!

907
01:03:49,734 --> 01:03:53,101
That's what the networks want.
Young.

908
01:03:54,171 --> 01:03:56,298
- How's your mother?
- Good.

909
01:03:56,674 --> 01:03:58,403
Good.

910
01:03:58,709 --> 01:03:58,809
<i>Disgraziata</i>!
That woman's a <i>disgraziata</i>!

911
01:03:58,809 --> 01:04:02,802
<i>Disgraziata</i>!
That woman's a <i>disgraziata</i>!

912
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:05,414
- What now?
- Listen to this, Gino.

913
01:04:05,583 --> 01:04:08,313
"<i>La Signora</i> Lina Paventi
wants to invite you...

914
01:04:08,486 --> 01:04:11,649
...to the wedding of her son, Nino."
Do I need to go on?

915
01:04:11,822 --> 01:04:13,517
Nino getting married?

916
01:04:13,691 --> 01:04:17,024
To Pina, <i>la puttana.</i>

917
01:04:17,194 --> 01:04:21,028
And look at this:
She even includes a handwritten note.

918
01:04:21,198 --> 01:04:24,133
"Dear Maria and Gino,
I'm sorry for what happened.

919
01:04:24,301 --> 01:04:26,997
Please see this invite
as a peace offering.

920
01:04:27,171 --> 01:04:30,140
I pray San Giuseppe
you can make it. Love, Lina."

921
01:04:31,208 --> 01:04:33,142
What's wrong with that?

922
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:35,835
You gotta read between the lines.

923
01:04:36,013 --> 01:04:40,245
What this really says is,
"Dear Maria and Gino.

924
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:43,751
I'm sorry your son
is still an <i>omosessuale</i>.

925
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:47,789
Please see this invite as proof
that mine is not.

926
01:04:47,958 --> 01:04:52,918
I pray San Giuseppe you can make it
so you can watch me gloat.

927
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:55,224
Love, Lina."

928
01:04:55,666 --> 01:04:57,896
<i>Disgraziata</i>!
Let me tear up the invitation!

929
01:04:58,068 --> 01:05:00,161
No! No! No!

930
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:01,905
I'm gonna send it back.

931
01:05:02,072 --> 01:05:08,341
R.S.V.P., " <i>Vaffanculo</i>! Love, Maria and
Gino!" And we're not sending a gift.

932
01:05:08,612 --> 01:05:10,239
- No gift.
- <i>Ma sei matto</i>?

933
01:05:10,548 --> 01:05:13,381
We gotta get them a gift.
Lina will think we're cheap.

934
01:05:13,551 --> 01:05:15,678
Nobody think I'm cheap.

935
01:05:16,253 --> 01:05:19,780
We make a check for $200
and then we don't show up!

936
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,885
We can't not show up.

937
01:05:24,061 --> 01:05:26,427
She's gonna tell everyone
that we're jealous.

938
01:05:26,597 --> 01:05:28,690
Jealous? Jealous of what?

939
01:05:30,334 --> 01:05:31,767
We go!

940
01:05:31,936 --> 01:05:33,836
But I don't buy a new suit.

941
01:05:35,172 --> 01:05:36,867
You wanna look like a bum?

942
01:05:37,107 --> 01:05:38,972
We go shopping tomorrow!

943
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:42,943
The best suit, the most beautiful
dress and the biggest gift.

944
01:05:43,113 --> 01:05:46,378
- That'll show her.
- Yeah! We'll go.

945
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:48,177
But we'll have a lousy time.

946
01:05:48,352 --> 01:05:51,617
We look our watch all night
and we yawn.

947
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:56,182
We can't have a lousy time.
Then she's gonna think we're bitter.

948
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:59,386
We dance until dawn.
That'll spite her!

949
01:05:59,563 --> 01:06:01,326
We can't dance until dawn.

950
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:04,900
Then she's gonna think
we're putting up a good front!

951
01:06:05,402 --> 01:06:06,960
We...

952
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:12,400
Maria, this make me tired.

953
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:15,469
<i>Are you sure about this, Pina?</i>

954
01:06:15,646 --> 01:06:17,944
Sure. With cannelloni,
you can never go wrong.

955
01:06:18,115 --> 01:06:23,883
No, you and Nino.
Marrying a bisexual.

956
01:06:24,054 --> 01:06:27,854
I am not marrying a bisexual.
Jesus-fucking-Christ.

957
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:29,925
Why didn't I keep my mouth shut?

958
01:06:30,094 --> 01:06:34,656
I'm marrying Nino. He was in love
with Angelo, now he's in love with me.

959
01:06:34,832 --> 01:06:36,732
- Okay.
- And you know what that means?

960
01:06:37,301 --> 01:06:40,236
It means that I am sexy enough
to convert him.

961
01:06:40,404 --> 01:06:42,065
Me, I can convert anybody.

962
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:45,299
Give me an hour in the Village
and there's not gonna be one.

963
01:06:45,476 --> 01:06:47,706
<i>Capito</i>? So can we
change the subject?

964
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:50,813
Sure. But if he ever ask you
to strap on a dildo...

965
01:06:50,981 --> 01:06:53,950
- Stop it!
...call me, I have quite the collection.

966
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:55,313
Stop it!

967
01:07:16,106 --> 01:07:19,234
- <i>I have an announcement to make.</i>
- <i>What now?</i>

968
01:07:19,677 --> 01:07:22,305
- I'm quitting my job to become a writer.
- A writer?

969
01:07:22,479 --> 01:07:25,414
- Cool!
- Who's gonna read what you write?

970
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,915
- That should be a hobby.
- Where's the security?

971
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:31,486
- Where's the pension plan?
- Don't listen to them. Ignore them.

972
01:07:31,655 --> 01:07:33,850
Look, this is what I wanna
do with my life.

973
01:07:34,024 --> 01:07:36,458
And you know what?
I'm gonna be a big success.

974
01:07:36,627 --> 01:07:38,891
Did we ever do what we
wanted to in our life?

975
01:07:39,063 --> 01:07:40,928
- Never.
- Does anybody hate his job...

976
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:43,225
...like I hate my job?
- No one!

977
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,426
Yet you see me go to work every day,
and look me now!

978
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:48,435
- And what do you got?
- Security.

979
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:50,574
And a pension plan.

980
01:08:31,048 --> 01:08:35,109
Gino. Maria.
What are you two doing here?

981
01:08:35,285 --> 01:08:37,219
We live here.
<i>Come sta</i>, Lina?

982
01:08:37,388 --> 01:08:39,982
<i>Bene</i>. I got your R.S.V.P.

983
01:08:40,157 --> 01:08:43,786
I can't tell you how happy I am
you're going to come to the wedding.

984
01:08:44,128 --> 01:08:48,121
Oh, Maria. Wait till you see
Pina's wedding dress.

985
01:08:48,298 --> 01:08:51,665
The first time she put it on,
I cried like a baby.

986
01:08:52,202 --> 01:08:54,227
She looks just like the Madonna.

987
01:08:54,405 --> 01:08:56,396
I'm sure the Madonna's real happy.

988
01:08:57,141 --> 01:08:59,302
Let me just take a minute
to tell you...

989
01:08:59,476 --> 01:09:02,741
...how sorry I am about what
happened at your house that night.

990
01:09:02,913 --> 01:09:05,905
- Nothing to be sorry about.
- The way Angelo spoke to you...

991
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:08,517
...it was disgusting.
- He was upset.

992
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:10,085
Yeah, he was upset.

993
01:09:10,254 --> 01:09:13,246
Now he's alone like a dog,
and that's what he deserves.

994
01:09:13,424 --> 01:09:15,585
- Who says he's alone like a dog?
- Who says?

995
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:18,660
Why? Are you talking to him?
I just assumed...

996
01:09:18,829 --> 01:09:21,923
- Always a mistake to assume.
- Big mistake to assume.

997
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:25,095
- He's moved back in?
- Why would he wanna do that?

998
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:27,737
- He's an adult.
- Adults should live on their own!

999
01:09:27,938 --> 01:09:33,672
Well, whatever you say. I just hope
he finds himself a nice Italian girl.

1000
01:09:33,844 --> 01:09:36,813
He won't find himself
a nice Italian girl. He's gay!

1001
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:38,504
Nobody is gayer than my son!

1002
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:42,883
- Yes. And he's got a new boyfriend.
- A gorgeous man!

1003
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:44,315
Loves Angelo to death!

1004
01:09:44,488 --> 01:09:47,286
I should love my wife
the way he love Angelo!

1005
01:10:06,176 --> 01:10:08,508
I never gave you
back my set of keys.

1006
01:10:11,515 --> 01:10:15,451
I know I should have called,
but it was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

1007
01:10:17,488 --> 01:10:20,582
- Okay, I'm gonna...
- You don't have to leave right away.

1008
01:10:28,932 --> 01:10:30,695
How you been, Angelo?

1009
01:10:34,004 --> 01:10:36,905
- How do you think?
- Hey, listen. What happened...

1010
01:10:37,074 --> 01:10:39,975
...it's for the best.
- It was?

1011
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:43,973
Listen, this marriage thing,
it's really cool.

1012
01:10:45,215 --> 01:10:48,616
Nino, what are you talking about?

1013
01:10:48,919 --> 01:10:51,513
I'm just saying,
you might want to give it a try.

1014
01:10:51,688 --> 01:10:53,952
- I know you're seeing a new guy...
- A new guy?

1015
01:10:54,124 --> 01:10:56,752
Yeah. Your mom told
my mom the other day.

1016
01:10:57,060 --> 01:11:00,257
She said that your parents acted
as though being gay was normal.

1017
01:11:01,765 --> 01:11:05,098
My mother said that
I was seeing a man?

1018
01:11:05,269 --> 01:11:06,827
Yeah.

1019
01:11:07,004 --> 01:11:11,839
Nino, is this why you came here?
To check up on me?

1020
01:11:14,178 --> 01:11:16,169
I just wanna make sure you're okay.

1021
01:11:17,915 --> 01:11:19,280
I'm okay.

1022
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:28,955
I never meant to hurt you.

1023
01:11:34,164 --> 01:11:37,429
- Did you ever love me?
- Come on, Angelo. That's not fair.

1024
01:11:37,601 --> 01:11:39,068
Did you?

1025
01:11:42,272 --> 01:11:46,868
We had a thing together
and it was fun. But it's over.

1026
01:11:47,578 --> 01:11:49,045
Everything's gonna be okay.

1027
01:11:52,716 --> 01:11:54,911
Tell me you're gonna be okay.

1028
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:00,846
Are you gonna be okay?

1029
01:12:21,144 --> 01:12:23,044
It's all my parents' fault.

1030
01:12:23,981 --> 01:12:27,280
What am I saying?
It's not my parents' fault. It's mine.

1031
01:12:27,451 --> 01:12:29,578
I did this to myself.

1032
01:12:29,753 --> 01:12:35,419
I single-handedly fucked up every
aspect of my life. I guess it's a talent.

1033
01:12:36,393 --> 01:12:39,055
You're not thinking very highly
of yourself, are you?

1034
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:40,594
No.

1035
01:12:41,999 --> 01:12:45,059
They told Nino's mother
I had a new boyfriend.

1036
01:12:46,603 --> 01:12:50,630
- How does that make you feel?
- I don't know.

1037
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:54,472
I'd like to call them,
but I wouldn't know what to say.

1038
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:01,345
That's understandable.
What are you feeling right now?

1039
01:13:03,587 --> 01:13:07,182
I'm sorry. I can't. This is stupid.

1040
01:13:07,357 --> 01:13:10,622
Fine! I should chop my head off
before I try to help you again.

1041
01:13:10,794 --> 01:13:15,356
- Oh, no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Lf you took me seriously...

1042
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,936
...I could really help you.
- All right, all right. Let's continue.

1043
01:13:20,103 --> 01:13:24,233
- Trust that I know what I'm doing.
- I trust. I trust.

1044
01:13:24,408 --> 01:13:25,705
Okay.

1045
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:33,439
Okay. Now I'm ready.

1046
01:13:34,851 --> 01:13:39,311
If you had Ma and Pa in front of you,
what would you tell them?

1047
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:41,914
- I don't know.
- Think about it.

1048
01:13:42,092 --> 01:13:43,787
- I am.
- Think about it more.

1049
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:46,589
- I am.
- You're not thinking hard enough!

1050
01:13:46,763 --> 01:13:49,960
Who are you to tell me I'm
not thinking about it hard enough?

1051
01:13:50,133 --> 01:13:53,591
Forget it! You think you can
figure this out by yourself? Go ahead!

1052
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:55,237
You figure!

1053
01:13:56,473 --> 01:13:59,442
I would tell them that the
last thing I wanted to do...

1054
01:13:59,609 --> 01:14:01,042
...was to hurt them.

1055
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:07,408
Go on.

1056
01:14:07,584 --> 01:14:10,849
I told them I was gay
because I wanted them to know...

1057
01:14:13,323 --> 01:14:15,723
I told them because I didn't
want them to die...

1058
01:14:15,892 --> 01:14:17,655
...without knowing who I really am.

1059
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:25,301
They deserve to know
who their son is.

1060
01:14:25,469 --> 01:14:28,836
Not an illusion or a delusion
of who I am, but who I am for real.

1061
01:14:32,642 --> 01:14:35,110
I did it all wrong, but...

1062
01:14:42,085 --> 01:14:43,814
Damn, I'm good!

1063
01:15:03,306 --> 01:15:05,934
<i>Perdonami, Padre</i>, for I have sinned.

1064
01:15:09,579 --> 01:15:12,275
<i>Perdonami, Padre</i>, for I have sinned.

1065
01:15:17,387 --> 01:15:19,218
Is anyone in there?

1066
01:15:20,190 --> 01:15:21,487
Yes?

1067
01:15:22,392 --> 01:15:25,293
Twice I have taken
the name of the Lord in vain.

1068
01:15:25,462 --> 01:15:27,987
- Ma, it's me.
- Angelo!

1069
01:15:28,165 --> 01:15:30,156
Are you crazy?
What are you doing there?

1070
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:32,392
- We have to talk, Ma.
- At confession?

1071
01:15:33,036 --> 01:15:35,470
- Forgive me, Mother, for I have sinned.
- Shut up.

1072
01:15:35,639 --> 01:15:39,075
I called you and your life worthless.
For that I am truly sorry.

1073
01:15:39,242 --> 01:15:43,110
- Oh, yeah? Why now?
- What do you mean, "Why now?"

1074
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,510
Why did you wait all this time
to be sorry?

1075
01:15:46,183 --> 01:15:49,482
Do you have any idea of the pain
you've put me through?

1076
01:15:49,653 --> 01:15:51,416
- Cut him some slack.
- Who's that?

1077
01:15:51,588 --> 01:15:54,580
- The Holy Spirit, Ma.
- Anna, where are you?

1078
01:15:55,992 --> 01:15:57,459
Here, Ma. In the next booth.

1079
01:15:57,627 --> 01:15:58,958
What did you do to Father?

1080
01:15:59,129 --> 01:16:01,927
- We bribed him.
- With wine and a carton of cigarettes.

1081
01:16:02,566 --> 01:16:04,534
Mari, why are you
taking you so long?

1082
01:16:04,701 --> 01:16:07,329
Will you get out?
I'm trying to confess myself.

1083
01:16:07,504 --> 01:16:11,304
<i>Padre</i>, she no let me touch her
anymore. Isn't that a mortal sin?

1084
01:16:11,475 --> 01:16:13,807
Will you stop? Angelo's in there.

1085
01:16:13,977 --> 01:16:16,343
- Our Angelo?
- How are you, Pa?

1086
01:16:16,513 --> 01:16:19,607
Angelo! You become a priest?

1087
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:22,348
Worse.
He bribed Father Carmignani.

1088
01:16:22,552 --> 01:16:25,487
A bottle of wine and cigarettes.
Can you believe that?

1089
01:16:25,655 --> 01:16:27,885
No. He usually settle
for a bottle of wine.

1090
01:16:28,058 --> 01:16:30,959
- You got screwed, Angelo.
- You guys bribed him already?

1091
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:32,755
- Who's that?
- Your daughter.

1092
01:16:32,929 --> 01:16:36,490
Anna, have you seen
my <i>Forza Italia</i> hat?

1093
01:16:36,867 --> 01:16:39,893
- Your mother lost it on me again.
- Would you please!

1094
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:42,231
Our son is trying to apologize to us.

1095
01:16:43,106 --> 01:16:46,633
You know, guys, I realize
that what I said to you was awful...

1096
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:50,177
...but what you did, trying to set me up
with Pina, that was low.

1097
01:16:50,347 --> 01:16:53,510
- I told her was a stupid idea.
- Shut up.

1098
01:16:53,683 --> 01:16:57,585
I know we're not the perfect parents,
but we did do some things right.

1099
01:16:57,754 --> 01:17:01,588
- Yeah, some things.
- And we are not worthless! <i>Hai capito</i>?

1100
01:17:01,758 --> 01:17:05,854
- Hey, I apologized for that already.
- Let me tell you, you haven't finished.

1101
01:17:06,029 --> 01:17:09,123
- What about the apology you owe me?
- Come to supper tonight...

1102
01:17:09,299 --> 01:17:11,961
...if you're willing
to step back in that prison.

1103
01:17:12,702 --> 01:17:14,761
- I'm sorry about that too.
- All right.

1104
01:17:14,938 --> 01:17:18,840
- How we gonna get out of here?
- Anyone sees us together, they'll talk.

1105
01:17:19,042 --> 01:17:21,636
Probably already talking
about your fag son, right?

1106
01:17:21,811 --> 01:17:24,439
Please, they've been talking
since my sister died.

1107
01:17:24,614 --> 01:17:27,879
All right. I say we all go out
at one time.

1108
01:17:28,718 --> 01:17:31,346
With our heads high up in the sky.

1109
01:17:31,521 --> 01:17:33,955
With all of Little Italy as our witness.

1110
01:17:34,124 --> 01:17:37,582
All right. One, two and a three.

1111
01:17:44,668 --> 01:17:47,193
Do we need to pass by
the grocery store?

1112
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:49,895
- We're out of cheese.
- I'll get some cigarettes.

1113
01:17:50,073 --> 01:17:52,337
Angelo. Angelo. Angelo.

1114
01:17:53,977 --> 01:17:55,535
What is it, Papa?

1115
01:18:01,685 --> 01:18:06,816
Hey, boss, thanks a lot
for giving me back my <i>famiglia</i>.

1116
01:18:09,192 --> 01:18:10,989
Come on. Come on.

1117
01:18:56,039 --> 01:18:59,736
- Gino, what if she can read lips?
- Then there is a God.

1118
01:19:44,621 --> 01:19:47,590
Today is a very special day.

1119
01:19:48,291 --> 01:19:52,057
I have known the groom, Nino,
all his life.

1120
01:19:52,228 --> 01:19:53,490
I baptize him...

1121
01:19:54,097 --> 01:19:57,089
...I gave him his First Communion...

1122
01:19:57,267 --> 01:19:59,258
...and when he hit puberty...

1123
01:19:59,602 --> 01:20:03,197
...and was having certain problems
due to his...

1124
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:06,600
How do you say...? Sudden growth.

1125
01:20:07,377 --> 01:20:10,608
I'm the one who suggested
he get circumcised.

1126
01:20:20,557 --> 01:20:26,257
If anyone here sees any just cause
why these two should not be married...

1127
01:20:26,429 --> 01:20:28,727
...speak now or forever
hold your peace.

1128
01:20:28,898 --> 01:20:30,798
Where do I start?

1129
01:20:42,545 --> 01:20:44,206
Nino Paventi...

1130
01:20:59,329 --> 01:21:02,298
I know this is difficult,
but I'm here for you.

1131
01:21:06,736 --> 01:21:09,398
I was wondering if your offer
was still valid.

1132
01:21:14,010 --> 01:21:17,343
- Absolutely.
- Good.

1133
01:21:17,781 --> 01:21:23,686
Hello? Gay Line? Hello?

1134
01:21:23,887 --> 01:21:26,287
My life has become
even more of a nightmare.

1135
01:21:26,456 --> 01:21:29,152
My brother wrote this TV show
based on our family.

1136
01:21:29,359 --> 01:21:32,385
I'm portrayed as this pathetic,
pill-popping, woman-child...

1137
01:21:32,562 --> 01:21:34,894
...stuck in a vicious circle of self-pity.

1138
01:21:35,064 --> 01:21:38,397
One more argument about why Angelo
left and I'm leaving the table.

1139
01:21:38,568 --> 01:21:40,832
No one is leaving until supper is done.

1140
01:21:41,004 --> 01:21:43,734
Who are you to tell her
when she can leave this table?

1141
01:21:43,907 --> 01:21:46,967
- Yeah, who are you?
- Hey, he's your father, that's who!

1142
01:21:47,143 --> 01:21:49,509
Where she learn to talk back,
I don't know.

1143
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:51,340
- She learn from you!
- From me?

1144
01:21:51,514 --> 01:21:54,813
- Yeah, from you!
- This is really, really good, Mama.

1145
01:21:56,686 --> 01:22:00,383
What inspired you to write this
show about the Italian community?

1146
01:22:01,691 --> 01:22:03,352
I don't know,
the Greek community?

1147
01:22:05,528 --> 01:22:07,291
He can't ******* help himself.

1148
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:10,490
I'm telling you,
this mother****** is a ******* genius.

1149
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,298
It's safe to say that
my family inspired me.

1150
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:16,197
When I was little,
I had this Aunt Yolanda.

1151
01:22:16,372 --> 01:22:18,499
She was the coolest of my relatives.

1152
01:22:18,675 --> 01:22:21,610
She wanted to be different.
She tried to teach everyone...

1153
01:22:21,778 --> 01:22:25,680
...how to do the mambo, but they
were stuck doing the tarantella.

1154
01:22:26,883 --> 01:22:28,373
I wish she were here.

1155
01:22:29,352 --> 01:22:31,980
This is a tribute to her
and to my family.

1156
01:22:33,022 --> 01:22:35,217
This little mother******
gets me every time.

1157
01:22:35,391 --> 01:22:39,987
- A tribute to his family.
- Please, like we need a tribute.

1158
01:22:40,163 --> 01:22:41,858
My brother is so delusional.

1159
01:22:42,232 --> 01:22:45,326
<i>Being gay and Italian, I wouldn't</i>
<i>wish that on my worst enemy.</i>

1160
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:48,869
<i>I mean, the hatred.</i>
<i>You know, the prejudice.</i>

1161
01:22:54,077 --> 01:22:57,979
I think living in denial
is an Italian tradition.

1162
01:22:58,214 --> 01:23:00,910
- Oh, my God!
- <i>She's gonna make a lousy mother.</i>

1163
01:23:01,117 --> 01:23:04,917
God, why am I such a bitch?
They're happy, so what?

1164
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:07,215
Why should that affect me in any way?

1165
01:23:08,057 --> 01:23:10,855
Just because I don't have
a wonderful husband like Nino.

1166
01:23:11,227 --> 01:23:13,286
Nino the heroic cop.

1167
01:23:13,763 --> 01:23:17,062
Nino the perfect son
and husband. Nino...

1168
01:23:17,233 --> 01:23:19,758
...the perfect camping buddy.

1169
01:23:25,575 --> 01:23:28,669
I'm afraid our time is up.
See you next week?

1170
01:23:28,845 --> 01:23:32,975
Oh, no. Don't take it personal, I never
see the same psychiatrist twice.

1171
01:23:33,149 --> 01:23:35,743
I know. We saw each other already.

1172
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:39,078
We did!

1173
01:23:40,089 --> 01:23:44,253
- I can't believe I didn't recognize you.
- So next Tuesday night. Is that okay?

1174
01:23:45,628 --> 01:23:48,756
Okay, next Tuesday night.

1175
01:23:48,932 --> 01:23:51,457
But it'll be the last time
you see my face.

1176
01:24:18,995 --> 01:24:21,555
What is this world coming to?

1177
01:24:21,731 --> 01:24:23,995
At least Angelo
could have had the decency...

1178
01:24:24,167 --> 01:24:27,102
...of finding himself a nice Italian boy!

1179
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:46,615
I always told him,
"You ever stop writing...

1180
01:24:46,789 --> 01:24:49,724
...I'm gonna come to your house
and kick your ******* ass.

1181
01:24:49,892 --> 01:24:51,951
Don't give up."
He's a genius.

1182
01:24:52,128 --> 01:24:54,653
He said that.
I stopped once and he did.

1183
01:24:54,831 --> 01:24:57,891
- I kicked your ass a bit. It wasn't bad.
- Just a little whup.

1184
01:24:58,067 --> 01:25:01,503
I threatened to throw him out
the ******* window, but it was a joke.

1185
01:25:01,671 --> 01:25:04,071
That was just a little tease.
I'm used to it.
