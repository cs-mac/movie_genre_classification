Jack, why don't you take Grandpa

All right.

Now l'll just have to show you
a few things.

322
00:24:02,373 --> 00:24:04,705
That was just a practice shot.
Give me another one of those.

-What do you mean ''not really''?

340

-Does she?
-Yeah.

Yeah, l can use them.

364
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:52,672
l can use them to beat you at golf,
that's how well l can use them.

-You like making fun of me, don't you?
-Yeah, you're funny.

So, what are your plans?

Well, l thought that l would stay
a day or two or so,

another time.

Well, maybe l can just spend time
with Jack?

446
00:31:36,994 --> 00:31:38,256
-You doing okay at home?
-Fine.

447
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,695
-You sure?
-Yeah.

448
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,230
Are you sure?

449
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:46,561
l didn't realize there was
so much to do around the house.

450
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:49,036
Mom would have loved
to hear you say that.

451
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,068
Yeah.

452
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,977
What was all that at dinner last night
with the chili sauce?

453
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,311
Jeff just doesn't let Jack
get his own way all the time, that's all.

454
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,612
They always fight.

455
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,051
l checked the train times.
There's one in a few hours.

456
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,422
l just gotta drop by the office first.

457
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,155
-Advertising?
-Advertising agency, yeah.

458
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:14,653
-Your agency?
-Part mine.

459
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,437
Amy. Wait, wait, wait.

460
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:34,213
To your left a little.
To your left, to your left.

461
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:37,050
-Okay.
-One more. lt's okay.

462
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:38,984
Just hold on.

463
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:41,685
-A little to your left. Left, left, left.
-l'm so sorry.

464
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,057
That's it.

465
00:32:44,528 --> 00:32:46,723
-l got it. Yeah.
-You got it?

466
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:49,825
STEPH: Yeah, no, that's a fish.
lt looks great.

467
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:50,891
TOM: lt looks good.

468
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:52,800
-l think it works perfectly...
-So remind me of the market.

469
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:56,136
TOM: Yep. lt's home owners,
blue collar to middle class.

470
00:32:56,173 --> 00:32:59,370
-Like my dad.
-Um, l guess, yeah. Sure.

471
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,640
STEPH: l guess.
TOM: Just like your dad. Sure.

472
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,145
So, pitch it to him.
Let's see what he thinks.

473
00:33:04,181 --> 00:33:06,012
Hey, Dad. Come over here.

474
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,143
-TOM: Right now? Sure.
-Yeah.

475
00:33:08,185 --> 00:33:10,653
-Hey. Tom.
-Tom? Hi, Tom. Frank.

476
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:12,952
-Frank, l'm Steph.
-Steph?

477
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,720
-Hi, Dad. ''Dad'' 'cause of...
-Hi. Frank.

478
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,820
We got a TV commercial.
They're gonna pitch it to you. Okay?

479
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:20,726
-Um, To...
-Sit down.

480
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:22,360
-Sit here?
-Yeah.

481
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,364
-ln your chair?
-Yeah.

482
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:28,034
-Now you're in charge.
-Nice chair.

483
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:31,803
Okay, so it's an ad for TV,
for a financial organization...

484
00:33:31,842 --> 00:33:34,709
-Yeah, don't tell him. Just pitch it.
-l'm so sorry.

485
00:33:34,745 --> 00:33:38,374
Okay. So there's a guy by the lake,
and he is fishing just like this.

486
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:41,380
STEPH: Pine forests.
Snow-covered mountains.

487
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:45,048
And he's wearing a quilted jacket
'cause, you know... lt's, like, really cold.

488
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:46,886
What do you do when it gets cold?
Put a quilted jacket on.

489
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:49,188
-He's a little nippy.
-A couple layers.

490
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,222
Okay, here we go.
Big fish jumps out of the water.

491
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:54,857
l'm talking a big mother
with big beady eyes.

492
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,595
-Kind of looks like... Right?
-Just like that.

493
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,830
Looks at the guy, right in the eyes,
and he says,

494
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:04,330
''Hey, brother, you looking for me?''
Voice over.

495
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:07,309
''Ever wonder why life wasn't this easy?

496
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:11,372
''At Crest and Landing, transferring
multiple loans to one company

497
00:34:11,415 --> 00:34:13,610
-''can be this easy.''
-TOM: Okay.

498
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,881
We cut to a shot right here of this guy
by a campfire.

499
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,117
We see that big fish right above
some coals, right? Close-up of the fish.

500
00:34:19,156 --> 00:34:21,386
Boom, right there! As he says,

501
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:25,484
''Hey, buddy, l'm done on this side.
Wanna turn me over?''

502
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:27,829
(LAUGHlNG ) That's...

503
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:30,129
-You like it?
-Yeah, it's funny.

504
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:31,828
lt's funny.
The fish talking, it makes me laugh.

505
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:33,029
Yeah, it's funny. lt's very funny.

506
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,197
Fish usually don't talk. That's why it's...

507
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:39,198
The fish with the face and the voice.
lt looks like a fish. You look like a fish.

508
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,679
Oh, my God, l just said that to him
yesterday. That he looked like...

509
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:44,578
His mom looks like a flounder.

510
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:47,880
-What was it for?
-What, the fish?

511
00:34:48,285 --> 00:34:51,015
-No, the spot. What was it selling?
-Yeah, the loans.

512
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,183
(STAMMERlNG ) That...

513
00:34:54,024 --> 00:34:56,822
lt's... Transferring the loans
to another company,

514
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,658
it's as easy as getting
the fish out of the water.

515
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:01,221
Good. So, does the client like it?

516
00:35:01,465 --> 00:35:04,025
-Likes it, but doesn't wanna go with it.
-AMY: Why not?

517
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:08,596
They feel uncomfortable about saying
that it's easy to transfer your debt.

518
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,164
-Because...
-Because it's not.

519
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:13,199
-lt's actually a nightmare.
-lt's, like, really hard.

520
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,075
-lt's like an impossible dream.
-STEPH: lt's like sudoku.

521
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:17,808
Okay, but he's not paying us
to advertise the fact

522
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:19,247
that he has
a perfectly average product.

523
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,148
He's paying us to be economical
with the truth.

524
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:24,018
So tell him from me
he's gotta go with the talking fish.

525
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:29,351
By the way,
your daughter is really good at her job.

526
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:33,489
-l know. That's the way she is.
-And she has great hair!

527
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,798
-TOM: lt's healthy.
-Okay.

528
00:35:44,608 --> 00:35:48,009
l know. Yeah, but you know what?
lt was fine.

529
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:51,173
But it would be really awesome,
l would... No.

530
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,614
AMY: There was a line. Sorry.

531
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,212
FRANK: My watch is off by an hour.
Should l change it?

532
00:35:57,421 --> 00:36:01,118
AMY: Uh, you came from New York, so,
yeah, you need to go back an hour.

533
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:02,591
Use Central Time.

534
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:07,257
You were laughing on the phone.
That was nice to see.

535
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,458
-l was?
-Yeah.

536
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,400
-lt was just work.
-lt was nice.

537
00:36:12,636 --> 00:36:15,104
-Was it the fish?
-The what?

538
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:18,472
-The fish?
-Yeah, the client went with the fish.

539
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,370
They said they should give it a name.
l said we should call it Frank.

540
00:36:22,646 --> 00:36:24,546
-Because of me?
-Of course 'cause of you!

541
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,176
-No, not because of me. Really?
-Yeah. For real.

542
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:29,243
-Frank the fish?
-Frank the fish.

543
00:36:29,286 --> 00:36:30,776
-No?
-What?

544
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,516
-Hi.
-Hey.

545
00:36:32,556 --> 00:36:35,184
Hey, you should be at your desk,
shouldn't you?

546
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:37,558
Dad, this is Tom,
one of our creative directors.

547
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:41,087
-Tom, this is my dad, Frank.
-Hi, sir. Nice to meet you.

548
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:43,998
-Tom.
-So, what are you up to?

549
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,297
l was supposed to be heading
out of town to meet a client,

550
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:47,770
but the train got delayed.

551
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,003
-Hey, why don't you sit down?
-No, no, no, l'd be interrupting you.

552
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:52,838
-No, it's fine. lt's fine.
-Really?

553
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,710
-Yeah. Sit down.
-TOM: Well, thank you.

554
00:36:56,814 --> 00:37:00,181
So, do you live here
or are you just visiting?

555
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,385
No, no, l'm just staying the one night.

556
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,693
-Here, this is for you.
-What is it?

557
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,355
-You'll see.
-Well, tell me.

558
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,456
No, you'll see. You'll see.
l didn't wanna send it in the mail.

559
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,899
-You'll see.
-Okay.

560
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,061
You know what l'm trying to do?

561
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,570
l'm trying to get us
all around the same table.

562
00:37:20,604 --> 00:37:23,402
The same table.
Yeah, like we used to at Christmas.

563
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:26,940
Are you happy?

564
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,773
-What do you mean?
-Are you happy?

A happy one. First one on my list.

568

lsn't it terrible about Alice?

569
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,381
-Alice?
-The storm sweeping up the coast.

Hmm.

571

-lt's Greek, l think, Alice.
-ls it Greek? Oh.
