1
00:00:07,776 --> 00:00:10,961
<i>Well, before telling the story
of that Christmas,</i>

2
00:00:11,116 --> 00:00:15,860
<i>I wanted to introduce you to the prettiest
town in the world, my grandparent' town,</i>

3
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:17,761
<i>where my parents were born,</i>

4
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:21,470
<i>and where each year we came
to spend the Christmas holidays.</i>

5
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:25,575
<i>This is Garibaldi street, with Naples Gate,</i>

6
00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:30,265
<i>so named because, they told me,
going always sflaight you get ta Naples.</i>

7
00:00:30,425 --> 00:00:35,385
<i>And the street, instead, is so named since
Garibaldi crossed it to go to Caprera.</i>

8
00:00:39,787 --> 00:00:42,893
Dearest Relatives,
Poisonous Relations

9
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:47,709
<i>In this building mum went to school,</i>

10
00:00:47,807 --> 00:00:50,207
<i>but now there is the City Hall.</i>

11
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:02,841
<i>This is the church of the Pilgrim Mother,</i>

12
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,247
<i>and the Madonna herself had it built,
once she had descended into town and said:</i>

13
00:01:08,537 --> 00:01:12,382
<i>"Here I've descended, and
here I want that you build my church. "</i>

14
00:01:34,763 --> 00:01:38,904
<i>The gentleman who's buying a
newspaper is lawyer Colacioppo.</i>

15
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:43,778
<i>Dad says he's famous because he treats
lawsuits aka in the cities of the North.</i>

16
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,537
Is it right that we poor workers
must work even on Christmas eve?

17
00:01:47,538 --> 00:01:49,062
Eh, ifs gotta end!

18
00:01:52,054 --> 00:01:56,248
It's gotta end? Christmas, Easter,
you gotta work, proletarians!

19
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:59,013
The Wall came down!
Who'll defend you now?

20
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,901
Let's not talk about it.

21
00:02:08,365 --> 00:02:12,620
<i>That lady, everyone knows her in town.
Her name is Assunta.</i>

22
00:02:12,918 --> 00:02:14,670
What're you doing tonight?

23
00:02:14,698 --> 00:02:17,360
You can't leave us alone on Christmas Eve!

24
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:19,186
What's your name, Miss?

25
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:21,569
Just call me Suzy, boys.

26
00:02:22,855 --> 00:02:25,050
<i>Dad says that she's important</i>

27
00:02:25,193 --> 00:02:28,833
<i>because she helps make the lives
of the soldiers less harsh.</i>

28
00:02:30,293 --> 00:02:33,273
<i>The owner of that boutique
is named Osvaldo.</i>

29
00:02:35,432 --> 00:02:38,435
Then we'll meet tonight,
at the "Sixth Sense".

30
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:42,437
<i>But I don't know why,
everyone calls him "The saleslady".</i>

31
00:02:42,438 --> 00:02:47,876
The Casta Diva walked by!
She's depriving us of the flower of youth!

32
00:02:51,884 --> 00:02:54,671
<i>This lady is one of Mum's schoolmates.</i>

33
00:02:54,678 --> 00:02:59,456
<i>Having a defect of sigh; since childhood
she wanted ta sell eyeglasses.</i>

34
00:02:59,463 --> 00:03:01,397
Here, try these eyeglasses.

35
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:08,641
How chic! As if Christian made them just
for you. Look in the mirror. Wondrous!

36
00:03:45,096 --> 00:03:49,533
<i>And this 11s the monument to the
most famous character: Ovidius Naso.</i>

37
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:53,592
Behind him, there's the nicest bar:
the "Grand Cafe".

38
00:04:00,893 --> 00:04:04,431
Anto'! Always lively like a cricket, eh?
- Again!

39
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:11,599
Cumpa', he still scores, sometimes!
- You fresh head!

40
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,821
Those with the skirt make my blood boil!

41
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:20,578
Shall we take a nougat?
- And that basket.

42
00:04:20,587 --> 00:04:24,546
Man is like the egg: the more it boils, the harder it gets.
- Idiots!

43
00:04:24,953 --> 00:04:29,356
<i>Here was born my mother,
and here still live my grandparents.</i>

44
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,658
<i>The one looking out,
is precisely Grandma Trieste.</i>

45
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:36,400
<i>But maybe it's best to know
me and my family first.</i>

46
00:04:43,293 --> 00:04:44,829
<i>This one is me.</i>

47
00:04:47,938 --> 00:04:53,103
<i>He 13 my father. He? A surveyor at the
technical office of our town, Teramo.</i>

48
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:57,129
<i>He's a fin of Pescara team, and
belongs to the Christian Demoaala.</i>

49
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,963
<i>But he always says that
he never voted for them.</i>

50
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:04,623
<i>My mum, instead, is a teacher,
and works in the town library.</i>

51
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:08,852
<i>She suffers from colitis with a
nervous dianhea, thanks to, says she:</i>

52
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:11,822
<i>the library manager,
my father, and me too.</i>

53
00:05:11,823 --> 00:05:15,122
This one decided that
what I cook isn't good for him.

54
00:05:15,534 --> 00:05:19,584
He prefers to fall sick and
make me die from fright. I'll say!

55
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:21,378
What did he do now?

56
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:26,054
I don't want to upset you on Christmas Eve.
Let bygones be bygones.

57
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:34,032
This one eats fried chips!
I found out that, after school,

58
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,571
he goes with Niuolino to gobble
fried chips at Paflnurger!

59
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:41,569
Michele, tell him that he's
ruining his stomach. His liver!

60
00:05:41,697 --> 00:05:43,540
Tell him how he'll end up!

61
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,113
You know how it ends?

62
00:05:45,152 --> 00:05:49,227
You'll carry for all your life a plastic
bag attached for your physical needs!

63
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:50,365
That's how!

64
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:54,479
Did you hear your mother, that you must no longer eat fries?
- Never!

65
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,640
Never ever!

66
00:05:56,434 --> 00:05:58,527
- Never!
- And hamburgers too!

67
00:05:58,546 --> 00:06:03,301
They can put inside whatever they want,
don't you get it? There's ice, go slowly.

68
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,359
Jesus, how much snow!
Just now that they're coming!

69
00:06:17,952 --> 00:06:19,067
Save'?

70
00:06:19,501 --> 00:06:23,828
Have you pulled the chain?
- Pull what? I didn't do anything!

71
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:28,220
Check better! You know they're
picky to find everything clean.

72
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,132
As if we're receiving
the Princes of Torlonia!

73
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:38,866
When Trieste tells you something,
you gotta do it, and shut up.

74
00:06:39,456 --> 00:06:43,062
Do as I said. Meanwhile,
bring the TV in the other room.

75
00:06:44,675 --> 00:06:45,721
Be calm.

76
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:50,618
<i>Grandpa is from Cistema,
and was a corporal of the Carabinieri,</i>

77
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:54,889
<i>first at Lanciano and then at Chieti Scalo,
where he was a sergeant.</i>

78
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:58,844
<i>Since a couple ofyearzs
he's begun to suffer a bit from memory,</i>

79
00:06:58,845 --> 00:07:01,097
<i>maybe because, throughout the day,</i>

80
00:07:01,115 --> 00:07:04,960
<i>he does nothing but wander around
the house and watch television.</i>

81
00:07:25,824 --> 00:07:27,530
It's cold!

82
00:07:28,111 --> 00:07:32,764
Come on, come on! - Mauro, open the trunk.
- Help me, it's freezing out here!

83
00:07:33,113 --> 00:07:34,853
Come on, Mauro, come on!

84
00:07:36,571 --> 00:07:41,042
Ooh, here we are! Grandpa!
Always on the ball, huh?

85
00:07:41,134 --> 00:07:43,785
I haven't voided my bowels for four days!

86
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:48,891
How are you, ma?
- Thank God, between straight and crooked!

87
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:52,517
Grandma!
- I haven't voided since four days.

88
00:07:52,518 --> 00:07:54,941
Lucky you! Me, two or three times a day.

89
00:07:54,954 --> 00:07:58,921
Still for that damn colitis?
- Mum, believe me, I no longer know what to eat!

90
00:07:58,922 --> 00:08:04,121
Pasta hurts me, meat hurts me, fish
hurts me, vegetables, not even the smell!

91
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:05,810
Can I go on like this?

92
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:08,370
Damned belly! I was worried.

93
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,102
<i>With this snow, the cars slip...</i>

94
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,737
<i>Luckily it just started to fall.
After the town of Popoli</i>

95
00:08:25,198 --> 00:08:27,814
<i>This is my grandparents' bedroom,</i>

96
00:08:27,902 --> 00:08:30,587
<i>where I've always slept since a child.</i>

97
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:34,083
<i>At first in the large bed,
and now in the folding bed.</i>

98
00:08:39,404 --> 00:08:42,988
<i>This was the room of uncle Alfredo
and uncle Alessandro.</i>

99
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:49,777
<i>And here instead were sleeping
mum when young, and her skter,</i>

100
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:51,882
<i>which would be my aunt Milena.</i>

101
00:08:59,676 --> 00:09:01,564
<i>This is the dining room.</i>

102
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:07,724
<i>The paintings are part of
grandpa's private collection.</i>

103
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:13,236
<i>They were all painted by
his Carabinieri mates.</i>

104
00:09:18,068 --> 00:09:22,528
<i>The one I like the most is this, where
they're having luncheon on the grass.</i>

105
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:28,210
I see that you have much good taste!

106
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:31,148
This one is a true masterpiece!

107
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,635
It was painted by first marshal
Giuseppe Miscia. It's also written.

108
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:42,372
Think that, all those in possession of his
paintings, are just waiting for his death.

109
00:09:43,497 --> 00:09:44,577
Why?

110
00:09:46,094 --> 00:09:47,891
I don't know that myself.

111
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,976
Mauro!
It's no use putting your stuff there.

112
00:09:50,977 --> 00:09:54,839
We talked about it. Stop sleeping with
your grandparents, you're big. Go!

113
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,842
And that's the coldest room!
You'll get sick for sure!

114
00:09:57,843 --> 00:10:01,222
Grandpa, may I sleep with you?
- You've always done it!

115
00:10:01,361 --> 00:10:05,559
How, cold? It's that you're used to
sleeping at a high temperature!

116
00:10:05,612 --> 00:10:07,102
So he falls ill!

117
00:10:07,554 --> 00:10:12,036
And then, my little grandson must sleep with us, that's it!
- He's grown!

118
00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:15,493
What grown?
Look at him, a tiny little creature!

119
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:22,490
<i>That's Alessandro.- Usually, soon after u;
came from Modena uncle A/essandm,</i>

120
00:10:22,491 --> 00:10:25,555
<i>mum's brother, with aunt Gina
and my cousin Monica.</i>

121
00:10:25,556 --> 00:10:27,387
You're fine? I'm glad.

122
00:10:29,304 --> 00:10:31,181
You're fine? I'm glad.

123
00:10:31,207 --> 00:10:36,232
<i>Uncle Alessandro loves nature, and is part
of a group called "Friends of the Earth".</i>

124
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:38,030
Hi, you're fine? I'm glad.

125
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:41,912
<i>But dad always says that he should thank
him and the Christian Democrats;</i>

126
00:10:41,913 --> 00:10:43,869
<i>if he's now a postal clerk.</i>

127
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:47,165
<i>Mum, however; says that
my uncle has a simple soul.</i>

128
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,824
<i>And that's why he married aunt Gina,</i>

129
00:10:49,837 --> 00:10:52,954
<i>who was, and still is,
up to all sort of houbles.</i>

130
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:57,767
<i>Monica seems always bigger.
She entered a contest far teenagers,</i>

131
00:10:57,836 --> 00:11:00,316
<i>and I think this went to her head,</i>

132
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:03,601
<i>because she says she wants
to be a dancer in TVshows.</i>

133
00:11:03,946 --> 00:11:07,052
Do we go up the attic to get
the Christmas baubles?

134
00:11:07,054 --> 00:11:09,466
Ugh! You still care about such things?

135
00:11:12,851 --> 00:11:15,718
<i>And also her chest seems
to have grown bigger.</i>

136
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:19,857
Eh, Alessa'...
The Berlin Wall has fallen.

137
00:11:19,858 --> 00:11:22,565
And so fell Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia,

138
00:11:22,634 --> 00:11:26,170
Bulgaria, Hungary, Albania...
Yugoslavia!

139
00:11:26,171 --> 00:11:31,417
And according to you, the hammer and
sickle still must remain under the oak?

140
00:11:31,418 --> 00:11:35,127
It is for keeping, in the Party's symbol,
a certain "continuum".

141
00:11:35,212 --> 00:11:37,146
- A what?
- A "continuum".

142
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:42,250
Me, yoga relaxes me a lot,
both the physique and the mind, y'know?

143
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:47,026
It's a bit like finding your balance
between your inner and your outer, here is.

144
00:11:47,027 --> 00:11:49,882
The ligaments, then, it loosens them all.

145
00:11:49,971 --> 00:11:53,402
Each day, then, I do at least
an hour of meditation.

146
00:11:53,403 --> 00:11:58,375
Oh, look, I advise it. If in the area there
is a yoga school, run there immediately.

147
00:11:58,461 --> 00:12:00,258
I'll find out about it.

148
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,911
- If there is, I'll run.
- Do run.

149
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,783
Who is it?

150
00:12:04,836 --> 00:12:08,886
<i>From Rome arrived uncle Hlippo
and aunt Milena, mum's other sister.</i>

151
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,533
- It's Milena.
- Mama!

152
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:16,400
<i>Uncle Filippo is a marshal of the
air force, and works upon a tower,</i>

153
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,140
<i>yet almost every day he comes
home with some wild chicory.</i>

154
00:12:20,252 --> 00:12:23,050
<i>Aunt Milena is very good,
and she's famous</i>

155
00:12:23,051 --> 00:12:27,659
<i>because many years ago she took part
in a radio program called 'The prawn...</i>

156
00:12:27,859 --> 00:12:31,282
<i>And maybe that's why she loves
quizzes and Mike Bongiorno.</i>

157
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:34,457
<i>However, her greatest grief
is not having children.</i>

158
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,990
How are you, are you fine?
- Fine. - I'm glad.

159
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,084
He's in great shape!

160
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:44,047
Hi, Michele. How are you?
- Hello. Everything fine? - Yes.

161
00:12:44,105 --> 00:12:46,642
You look great!
- Hello, Filippo!

162
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:50,898
You know what's my greatest flaw?
It's that I'm too good.

163
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:56,228
I give people all I have. Everything.
And you know what I get in return?

164
00:12:56,634 --> 00:13:01,310
A nice kick you-know-where, that's what.
- Being good always ends up that way.

165
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:04,755
<i>This is the last family member,
uncle Alfredo.</i>

166
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:08,801
<i>He? A bachelor, and teachm
Italian at a girls'sohool.</i>

167
00:13:08,802 --> 00:13:10,611
- That's for you.
- Thanks.

168
00:13:10,637 --> 00:13:15,722
Alfredo! - Beauties! Milena, Lina and Gina!
- You remember them all.

169
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,938
How are you?
- Fine, fine. And yourselves?

170
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:21,539
You're fine? I'm glad!

171
00:13:22,642 --> 00:13:25,850
Papa!
- Hey, professor, come here!

172
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:30,902
Lucky man! Lucky you,
always amidst those young girls, eh?

173
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:34,634
When will we read in the papers
"A professor involved... "?

174
00:13:34,635 --> 00:13:37,468
Come on, who do you take me for?
- Oh, alright!

175
00:13:37,472 --> 00:13:40,873
Young kid!
Are you offended? Young kid!

176
00:14:05,824 --> 00:14:09,612
How beautiful! What do you say? Where shall we put it?
- Dunno!

177
00:14:09,912 --> 00:14:12,779
Don't you like decorating
the Christmas tree?

178
00:14:20,982 --> 00:14:23,519
What are you doing? It's for the tree!

179
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:29,720
You look good. Slimmed down.
- I should think so. A month on white rice.

180
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:32,745
Still for that colitis?
- Ah, don't ask me!

181
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:37,176
By now I've grown old on it!
Rather, what about you, for that polyp?

182
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,577
There's mum.
Did you get a check-up?

183
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:42,867
I'll tell you later.
Monica's developed a lot, eh?

184
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:47,590
She's so dear, God bless her!
- Sure hers is a critical age.

185
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:52,320
How's school going?
- Poor thing! She slogs on books, she applies herself.

186
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:56,567
A genius she's not, so, whatever
she manages to do, so much the better.

187
00:14:56,635 --> 00:15:00,811
What are you eating?! Do you know
how many calories are in that stuff?

188
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:03,428
You're really hard-headed!
- Leave her alone!

189
00:15:03,442 --> 00:15:06,696
I can't! She's growing an ass
as large as a county!

190
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:08,792
Then she wants to be a dancer!

191
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:11,818
Eh, alright, in a few years
she'll understand!

192
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:14,823
Let's hope in God!
- Beautiful, this sweater!

193
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:16,680
Neither heavy nor light.

194
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:19,808
Oh, but it's cashmere!

195
00:15:20,164 --> 00:15:23,407
I prefer to buy just one, but good.
- Eh, yeah!

196
00:15:23,408 --> 00:15:27,327
It's no use buying a lot of stuff,
if you end up throwing it away.

197
00:15:27,328 --> 00:15:29,353
- Of course!
- Am I right?

198
00:15:30,234 --> 00:15:35,251
Look, did you go to Antonella's wedding?
- Lina, they're fresh from the oven. - N000!

199
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:40,238
At least you, Milena. The 'taralli' that
I used to make when you were children.

200
00:15:40,627 --> 00:15:42,811
Er... Exactly for that, mum.

201
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:47,254
I don't feel like, it takes me
as a lump at the stomach, thanks.

202
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:51,029
But it's water and wine.
Even children can digest this!

203
00:15:51,195 --> 00:15:54,608
Eh... Well, mum don't insist.
She said no!

204
00:15:55,745 --> 00:16:00,751
Well, here they are. If you want them...
- I'd have one willingly! - Oh, good!

205
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:03,889
But, grandma, you forgot?

206
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:07,323
Don't talk about children
to aunt Milena. She gets sad.

207
00:16:07,324 --> 00:16:09,485
Alright! But all the times!

208
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:14,264
What's that, a little tarallo?

209
00:16:14,646 --> 00:16:18,230
I was saying, I want to ask you:
How was the wedding?

210
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:23,730
Well... First of all, that day,
I got a fever here on my lip.

211
00:16:23,923 --> 00:16:28,417
This thing comes out each time there's
something important. Let's gloss over.

212
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:31,698
Wouldn't the battery go dead
just that morning?

213
00:16:31,836 --> 00:16:36,447
Now, had they held the wedding in a
church downtown I'd have taken a taxi.

214
00:16:36,448 --> 00:16:40,242
But no! They had to to get
married in the countryside!

215
00:16:40,243 --> 00:16:42,541
As if it were Caroline of Monaco!

216
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:45,903
But I say! - How presumptuous!
- Too ambitious.

217
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,976
Excuse me, honey,
did you remember my anxiolytic?

218
00:16:49,044 --> 00:16:51,080
Me?! What a nerve!

219
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:53,747
I should even remember your anxiolytic?

220
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:58,245
How am I going to sleep, now?
Damn... the devil!

221
00:16:58,337 --> 00:17:03,127
But you know when you close a home?
The shutters, the light, the gas...

222
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,068
Defrosting the fridge! He does nothing!
And I should even remember his anxiolytic?

223
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,833
I don't even have the prescription with me.

224
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:15,118
If you want, I can give you some of my Valium.
- But it's not the same!

225
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,277
God, it's starting! He won't collaborate!
- I'm going to get the eel.

226
00:17:19,278 --> 00:17:22,395
Why don't you learn from Alfredo,
who does it all?

227
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:25,843
We're to the point that at times
he gets home before me.

228
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:30,956
But I'll say, at least set the table!
Do something! Raise for once your ass!

229
00:17:30,957 --> 00:17:35,729
But no! I must even think of
his anxiolytic. What the heck!

230
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,290
What're you doing? That's mine!
- Damn!

231
00:17:38,836 --> 00:17:40,645
But she, how was she?

232
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:44,458
She says it was a Valentino bridal gown.

233
00:17:44,471 --> 00:17:49,704
Who knows how much it cost then.
- I don't think so! I think she got it at a wholesale.

234
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,638
<i>Usually, after the weddings,</i>

235
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:56,380
<i>mum and the aunts would start to talk
about the illnesses of their acquaintances.</i>

236
00:17:56,635 --> 00:17:58,933
Do you know Rosalba, my colleague?

237
00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:02,552
Who? The one I met last summer at the beach?
- Right her.

238
00:18:02,553 --> 00:18:07,005
She was taking a shower, at some point
she noticed something hard at her breast.

239
00:18:07,006 --> 00:18:09,895
Like a chickpea, here.
- Don't touch yourself!

240
00:18:09,902 --> 00:18:14,851
At the office she confides to me. I say,
Love, drop everything and go see a doctor.

241
00:18:14,942 --> 00:18:18,506
The doctor, soon as he saw her,
realized immediately.

242
00:18:18,507 --> 00:18:23,655
He made a smear test, and told her:
Dear lady, we must operate immediately!

243
00:18:23,656 --> 00:18:24,771
Oh my God!

244
00:18:24,816 --> 00:18:28,741
Just excised the...
- Chickpea! - Chickpea...

245
00:18:29,073 --> 00:18:30,791
He had it analyzed.

246
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:33,982
Malignant!

247
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:40,480
<i>Once alone, mum and aunt Milena
would start to speak badly of aunt Gina.</i>

248
00:18:40,714 --> 00:18:45,344
Did you hear? Now she's doing yoga.
She says she must relax.

249
00:18:45,512 --> 00:18:48,994
But from what?
If I were Alessandro, a cure of slaps!

250
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:52,681
And the cashmere? The fur?
Where does she get all that money?

251
00:18:52,743 --> 00:18:56,361
Oh, my Milena, let me tell you!
How naive you are!

252
00:18:56,628 --> 00:18:59,426
You don't say!
I can't believe it!

253
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:03,361
You heard what a disaster?
- What happened? - The earthquake!

254
00:19:03,362 --> 00:19:07,822
You didn't hear the TV? - Where?
- Eh, hundreds and hundreds of dead people.

255
00:19:07,906 --> 00:19:11,550
But where?
- I didn't get it well, somewhere in China.

256
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:15,620
Eh, okay! They're almost a billion people,
accustomed to catastrophes,

257
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,691
hunger, epidemics, famines. .!

258
00:19:17,709 --> 00:19:21,805
I, then, I can't really watch
certain scenes on TV. They hurt me.

259
00:19:21,806 --> 00:19:24,422
I'm too sensitive.
- Yes, I know!

260
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:27,908
My God, my God, have mercy on us!

261
00:19:28,211 --> 00:19:30,793
Life lasts like a look out the window!

262
00:19:31,151 --> 00:19:36,509
Listen. But you think that she's still
with that one, or she changed partner?

263
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,832
One only?
They saw her going to the movies alone.

264
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:42,181
- Going in, alone.
- Ehm...

265
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,417
Er. . So the refreshment wasn't that much.

266
00:19:45,691 --> 00:19:48,273
Standing!
They wanted something modern.

267
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:50,970
I, then, with high heels!
- Imagine!

268
00:19:54,306 --> 00:19:58,037
You saw how she looked at us?
- She's got a guilty conscience.

269
00:19:58,109 --> 00:19:59,189
Well!

270
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,252
Mum and dad are fine, aren't they?

271
00:20:03,947 --> 00:20:06,518
Dad too. I found him better this time.

272
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,189
Yes, true, I too noticed an improvement.

273
00:20:09,192 --> 00:20:11,615
He's more aware.
- Really better.

274
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:13,516
"Thank you."

275
00:20:13,991 --> 00:20:16,858
"Very good. How are you?"

276
00:20:23,229 --> 00:20:25,197
What have you got to look?

277
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:27,165
Nothing!

278
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,634
"Very good!"

279
00:20:32,422 --> 00:20:34,424
Mad! All mad!

00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,542
Oh, the eel. Look at that eel!

293
00:21:41,404 --> 00:21:44,544
Hey, what're you doing?
- What's he doing?

294
00:21:45,336 --> 00:21:48,635
What's he going to do now?
- Get it! - Where is it?

295
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:50,543
What. .?

296
00:21:55,168 --> 00:21:57,113
- But...
- And now?

297
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:05,765
I always tell Trieste to shut the doors,
that animals may come in. Not a chance!

298
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:10,538
<i>Rizzitelli hit by an elbow.</i>

299
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:13,596
<i>Side kick for Italy.
From Baldini to Werchowod.</i>

300
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,775
<i>The ball is now to Kulikov,
then Shalimov...</i>

301
00:22:23,469 --> 00:22:24,527
Damn. .!

302
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,462
Ah, our goalie made a great save!
- But he kicked to the stars!

303
00:22:31,585 --> 00:22:34,395
At any rate, Zenga's
the best goalie in the world!

304
00:22:34,523 --> 00:22:36,411
Yes, a real purebred!

305
00:22:36,434 --> 00:22:37,753
Look at that body!

306
00:22:37,788 --> 00:22:41,610
Did you see that cock stroke?
If he jumps on you, he'll chew you up.

307
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,078
A cheetah!

308
00:22:43,191 --> 00:22:45,864
See what he's done at the 45th minute?

309
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:49,471
In what club does he play?
- Inter! What else? - Ah, yes.

310
00:22:51,031 --> 00:22:54,490
Luckily the eel fell on the balcony below.

311
00:22:54,491 --> 00:22:58,746
Imagine if it fell on someone's head!
- Ersilia just couldn't believe it.

312
00:22:59,937 --> 00:23:03,091
What's with that brazier?
- I'm taking it to our room.

313
00:23:03,092 --> 00:23:07,573
Mum, how should we tell you that a brazier
in the bedroom is very dangerous?

314
00:23:07,574 --> 00:23:09,576
It burns off the oxygen.

315
00:23:09,602 --> 00:23:12,703
Just an hour!
We'll take it out before sleeping.

316
00:23:12,704 --> 00:23:15,161
I wanna see when you'll buy a stove!

317
00:23:15,172 --> 00:23:18,801
We've been using it for fifty years,
and we're still alive!

318
00:23:18,975 --> 00:23:22,342
Sure that mum too, sometimes,
is hard-headed!

319
00:23:56,843 --> 00:23:58,322
Turn off the light.

320
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,151
<i>This bell is named "the call".</i>

321
00:24:08,168 --> 00:24:11,828
<i>771ey ring it during a procession
on the evening of Christmas Eve.</i>

322
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:14,536
<i>Grandma says it's a very ancient tradition.</i>

323
00:24:19,614 --> 00:24:21,582
Mum, where's the cinammon?

324
00:24:27,765 --> 00:24:29,198
It started.

325
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:04,700
<i>While the bell rings every thing in town
stops, and everyone must stay home,</i>

326
00:25:04,745 --> 00:25:09,068
<i>because the tradition goes that
children must kiss their parents' hand.!</i>

327
00:25:47,115 --> 00:25:49,731
Can you see well, like this? Can you see?

328
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:51,520
You see well?

329
00:25:51,729 --> 00:25:55,799
No, I can't see. More on the right.
- Like that? - That's perfect.

330
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,488
No, now I can't see anything, sorry!
- Wait a sec, Alfredo.

331
00:25:59,489 --> 00:26:03,607
Well, sorry, but now I can't see, though!
- That's good, well done.

332
00:26:03,749 --> 00:26:06,354
Here come the spaghetti with tuna!

333
00:26:11,589 --> 00:26:13,090
Children first!

334
00:26:14,151 --> 00:26:17,821
To Monica.
- A little more, grandma!

335
00:26:17,822 --> 00:26:21,053
How much are you taking?
- It's Christmas, come on!

336
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,864
Eat, eat! This way you'll win for sure
the dancer's contest on TV!

337
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,925
Good things in life are either
illegal or immoral, or make you fat.

338
00:26:29,926 --> 00:26:33,635
So said Bernard Shaw.
- Oh, cute! Who said that?

339
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,996
A friend of mine, someone I know.

340
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:39,875
For me just a little,
I have to keep myself light.

341
00:26:40,091 --> 00:26:42,753
And just why must you keep yourself light?

342
00:26:43,256 --> 00:26:45,065
As if you didn't know!

343
00:26:45,992 --> 00:26:48,278
Well, I forgot! Why?

344
00:26:49,332 --> 00:26:50,811
Because tomorrow...

345
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,374
I'm on dUtY!

346
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:58,429
Saverio! You... it's twenty years
that you've been discharged.

347
00:27:00,692 --> 00:27:01,784
Guys!

348
00:27:02,436 --> 00:27:04,131
I regret saying this...

349
00:27:04,306 --> 00:27:06,957
but since some time your mother...

350
00:27:07,537 --> 00:27:09,789
is somewhat off her head.

351
00:27:10,507 --> 00:27:14,500
We must take measures,
before it's too late.

352
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:17,060
Trieste! You must get treated!

353
00:27:18,206 --> 00:27:19,969
That's the last straw...

354
00:27:19,994 --> 00:27:24,137
Come on, ma, it's Christmas!
Long live! Bon appefit!

355
00:27:24,138 --> 00:27:26,197
Best wishes!

356
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,843
<i>Wishing you a Merry Christmas...</i>

357
00:27:31,864 --> 00:27:36,454
Hey, look at her! I remember her
exactly the same since I was little.

358
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:41,631
<i>Ah, the Gambineri!- ... We'll have
external connections with special guests.</i>

359
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,366
Ma! They're too good!

360
00:27:45,512 --> 00:27:47,230
Don't stuff yourself!

361
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,661
Oh, go to...

362
00:27:50,984 --> 00:27:52,360
Always refined!

363
00:27:52,792 --> 00:27:55,204
Sure that, look how much grace of God.

364
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:59,516
And in Italy there's still someone who
complains. Here we have everything.

365
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:02,134
Food aplenty, democracy, freedom.

366
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:04,805
A paradise! And to think that...

367
00:28:05,692 --> 00:28:10,846
certain Italians have had to wait for
the end of Communism, to realize it.

368
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,577
Try as you might, our revolutionaries!
I, right now...

369
00:28:15,072 --> 00:28:19,054
I'd send them all to Russia.
Albania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia...

370
00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:23,967
Uh, what a ball breaker!
- Poor people! They're suffering from hunger and cold.

371
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:28,234
I just can't think about it.
It breaks my heart!

372
00:28:33,707 --> 00:28:36,938
It's good! What is it?
- Nebbiolo. A DOC class wine.

373
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,168
There, see, I can't stand her.

374
00:28:50,424 --> 00:28:54,692
I wonder how the heck an athlete like
Borg could mate with someone like her.

375
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:57,605
I wouldn't touch her
with a three yards stick!

376
00:28:58,124 --> 00:29:01,616
Forget it, Alfredo.
Me, some good stroke of stick...

377
00:29:02,716 --> 00:29:06,254
You're always ready,
when it comes to sticks, right?

378
00:29:06,873 --> 00:29:08,955
If I were 70 years old...

379
00:29:09,535 --> 00:29:11,264
I'd show you all!

380
00:29:12,706 --> 00:29:14,242
Shut up, and eat!

381
00:29:24,199 --> 00:29:26,804
Fresh fish! Here you go.

382
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:32,015
What are these things?

383
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:36,763
They're cauliflowers fried in batter.
- Oh, good! - They're delicious.

384
00:29:37,211 --> 00:29:40,823
There you go, a small fish, Gina?
- Just one? Another!

385
00:29:40,824 --> 00:29:44,863
No, that's all, don't overdo.
You're greedy, I gotta watch out.

386
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:48,146
For just a small fish?
- OK, I'll eat them myself.

387
00:29:48,147 --> 00:29:50,900
I want to know why you eat like a dumpster.

388
00:29:52,314 --> 00:29:54,384
I don't eat like a dumpster.

389
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:56,827
- Then how?
- I eat normally.

390
00:29:56,933 --> 00:30:00,384
Don't you get it?
This way you don't savor what you eat.

391
00:30:00,385 --> 00:30:02,068
I savor, I savor!

392
00:30:02,265 --> 00:30:06,247
People! I break my back in the kitchen!
Every day!

393
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:10,312
He comes... gulps everything.
He doesn't even notice what he's eating!

394
00:30:10,313 --> 00:30:13,416
I notice, stop it!
- I stop when I please, okay?

395
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:16,557
But it's Christmas!
- It's Christmas!

396
00:30:18,712 --> 00:30:22,635
<i>This is the singer who holds
the record for album sales,</i>

397
00:30:22,636 --> 00:30:24,945
<i>for the song "White Christmas",</i>

398
00:30:24,962 --> 00:30:26,839
<i>ie, "Bianca Natale-T.</i>

399
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:32,293
<i>In your opinion, this singer that you
see, is Pat Boone?- No, no, not-No.</i>

400
00:30:32,294 --> 00:30:36,492
<i>No, it's not Pat Boone. Indeed, this is Bing Crosby.
- Bravo'.!</i>

401
00:30:36,686 --> 00:30:38,165
Bravo!

402
00:30:39,413 --> 00:30:41,574
You know everything, eh?

403
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:44,556
I can't. Ever since I was little.

404
00:30:46,205 --> 00:30:47,866
Ah, these fishbones!

405
00:30:51,046 --> 00:30:53,890
Once in a while I recall
when you were children.

406
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:57,624
And I have to take it off my mind quickly.
- Why?

407
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:01,313
Because I get a lump in my throat.
- Mama!

408
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,522
I wanted that you'd grow up happy!

409
00:31:04,941 --> 00:31:06,852
But we are all happy!

410
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:10,116
Eh, but I always tell Jesus:

411
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:13,849
Make mesuffer, and don't make them suffer.

412
00:31:13,851 --> 00:31:17,878
Mum! Why you do that?
We're all here, happy.

413
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,100
Huh? True?

414
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,333
It's true.

415
00:31:22,107 --> 00:31:25,179
We've been lucky to have had children.

416
00:31:27,606 --> 00:31:32,817
But when I think of those poor people
who don't have any... How sad!

417
00:31:48,787 --> 00:31:51,301
- Why you do that?
- Oh, sorry.

418
00:31:51,728 --> 00:31:55,858
Sorry.
- You don't need to be sorry. We're your family.

419
00:31:56,198 --> 00:31:58,758
It's you who shouldn't take it this way.

420
00:31:58,881 --> 00:32:00,223
It hurts you.

421
00:32:01,114 --> 00:32:03,776
God wished that you hadn't any, that's it.

422
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:07,046
Believe me, children are
not everything in life...

423
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:09,841
Jeez, when mum starts with her speeches...

424
00:32:12,983 --> 00:32:16,214
Dear, don't worry,
nothing happened to your aunt.

425
00:32:17,077 --> 00:32:20,080
Come on, go.
Go, we'll come right away.

426
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:22,655
But, I wanted some Coca Cola.

427
00:32:22,945 --> 00:32:24,833
Look at that impudence!

428
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:28,672
What comes to your mind? Coca Cola?!
Coca Cola with cod!

429
00:32:29,002 --> 00:32:33,029
Crazy things! You see it?
They're only good to poison your blood!

430
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:35,855
But at least you have a reason to live for.

431
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:40,870
Fact is that I'm stressed. You don't know
how bad a nervous breakdown can be!

432
00:32:40,871 --> 00:32:43,556
I know, I know!
- No, you don't know!

433
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,272
Only he who really suffers knows.
You don't know, no, you don't!

434
00:32:47,273 --> 00:32:49,525
Then what can I say? I don't know!

435
00:32:49,543 --> 00:32:54,884
You wake up in the morning, and you feel
useless. You understand? Desperate!

436
00:32:54,885 --> 00:32:56,580
But why?

437
00:32:56,609 --> 00:33:01,876
Because I'm alone! Alone, Madonna.
Completely alone!

438
00:33:02,461 --> 00:33:06,548
To whom I'll give this love I have inside?
To whom, to whom, to whom?

439
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:09,268
To me, darling, to me!
- To Filippo, see?

440
00:33:15,882 --> 00:33:19,302
You know who we met last summer
at the Tremiti islands?

441
00:33:19,303 --> 00:33:21,533
- Clelia.
- What Clelia!

442
00:33:21,756 --> 00:33:26,253
None other than, brace yourselves,
Ornella Muti.

443
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,738
Come on, it can't be. At the Tremiti?
Wasn't she at Porto Ercole?

444
00:33:29,739 --> 00:33:33,948
I'm telling you she was at Tremiti
with her Facchinetti and her children.

445
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:37,378
I couldn't believe it myself.
I thought, "imagine"

446
00:33:37,379 --> 00:33:40,484
if a star like that comes
to live here. "Instead..."

447
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:44,455
Instead, early one morning we met her,

448
00:33:44,832 --> 00:33:48,893
normal, while she was going to
the beach with all her tribe.

449
00:33:49,002 --> 00:33:50,526
What is she like?

450
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,846
- Who?
- Ornella Muti.

451
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:56,001
How should she be? A hot piece!

452
00:33:56,198 --> 00:33:59,110
Well, look, she's not all that beauty!

453
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,952
She's petite...

454
00:34:01,147 --> 00:34:04,059
And then has pointed ears.
A bit like Lina.

455
00:34:04,065 --> 00:34:06,985
I? I have pointed ears?
I have pointed ears?

456
00:34:06,986 --> 00:34:10,860
I don't think. - A little.
- Pay no heed! She's a beautiful mare!

457
00:34:10,861 --> 00:34:13,375
She's well proportioned, I must admit.

458
00:34:13,482 --> 00:34:15,814
A cute face, so natural...

459
00:34:21,338 --> 00:34:24,080
And this one too.
Still alive and kicking?

460
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:28,075
- Sandrocchia.
- Hottie!

461
00:34:31,656 --> 00:34:35,922
You see, you reminded me of Alfredo,
when he was little, he...

462
00:34:37,249 --> 00:34:40,889
he'd stand before the mirror,
and imitate whatshername...

463
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:43,450
Sandra Milo e the Kessler twins!

464
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:46,282
Mum, please, you know
I hate these memories!

465
00:34:46,327 --> 00:34:49,945
What's so wrong? We're in the family!
- What a laugh!

466
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:54,298
♪ The night is small, for us,
too small...

467
00:34:54,299 --> 00:34:57,826
Go on, Alfredo!
- Come on, Alfredo, you do us a piece?

468
00:35:03,983 --> 00:35:05,792
I'm not in shape, guys.

469
00:35:07,018 --> 00:35:08,713
Alright, I'll do it.

470
00:35:08,819 --> 00:35:11,049
An applause for encouragement!

471
00:35:11,822 --> 00:35:13,995
But just a short piece, though.

472
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,239
Perform the "Dadaumpa".

473
00:35:17,072 --> 00:35:19,825
Give us a show, come on!

474
00:35:19,987 --> 00:35:23,548
Turn off the light,
for a little atmosphere. And the TV.

475
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:27,825
Turn it off. - Dad, the TV.
- Come on, he's got to concentrate.

476
00:36:22,621 --> 00:36:26,370
They'll hire you as a dancer on TV, not my daughter!
- Thanks, mum.

477
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:27,770
You're welcome!

478
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:31,608
Alfredo, you have to promise
something to your mum.

479
00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:34,840
What?
- Eh, I want to see you set up,

480
00:36:34,919 --> 00:36:39,060
with a beautiful wife, and you too
must give me a little grandchild.

481
00:36:41,202 --> 00:36:42,555
But I'm single.

482
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:44,028
Who is he?

483
00:36:44,609 --> 00:36:47,578
Is called that way
one who wants to live alone.

484
00:36:47,734 --> 00:36:50,032
Mum, Alfredo must do what he wants.

485
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:54,787
Okay, now that you're young, Alfredo.
But when you'll be old?

486
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:57,119
Who will take care of you?

487
00:36:57,471 --> 00:37:00,941
Were it not for you,
what would our life be?

488
00:37:00,942 --> 00:37:04,924
Mum, Alfredo is right.
Finding a good girl is difficult nowadays.

489
00:37:05,273 --> 00:37:07,912
Don't believe that people are all like us!

490
00:37:07,921 --> 00:37:12,116
They're ignorant, hypocritical, false.
They only care for their petty own!

491
00:37:12,117 --> 00:37:14,574
Because was lost the sense of the family!

492
00:37:14,585 --> 00:37:18,169
That's why the youth grow up adrift,
without ideals.

493
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:22,509
But do we want to put in our mind
that we are only replicators?

494
00:37:22,819 --> 00:37:27,995
So then, our task is that of
finding a wife, a home, a job...

495
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:30,453
to bring children into the world...

496
00:37:31,906 --> 00:37:33,146
And then...

497
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:38,139
try to be as united as possible,
and hold hands.

498
00:37:38,693 --> 00:37:39,796
It's true!

499
00:37:40,568 --> 00:37:42,024
Holding hands...

500
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:45,415
and give much, much, much love!

501
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:47,646
- But the eel?
- Here it is!

502
00:37:50,191 --> 00:37:54,890
Luckily it fell on the balcony of
the Cardellini! Cesira caught it.

503
00:37:54,947 --> 00:37:57,029
What have you got to look?

504
00:37:59,807 --> 00:38:03,083
Sure that this Christmas
came with all the trappings.

505
00:38:03,487 --> 00:38:05,250
Watch how it's falling!

506
00:38:10,764 --> 00:38:14,666
It's all so beautiful!
So intimate!

507
00:38:15,644 --> 00:38:19,250
There's an atmosphere
so evocative, so special!

508
00:38:19,909 --> 00:38:22,116
Full of significance!

509
00:38:25,078 --> 00:38:29,617
Also in your region you use to eat the eel?
- No, we're not used.

510
00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:32,103
It's so good, my big eel!

511
00:38:32,641 --> 00:38:36,327
You don't know what you're missing.
- She knows, she knows...

512
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:41,429
Remember when we were kids,
and we all went down to play in the snow?

513
00:38:41,581 --> 00:38:44,885
And you'd fall on your back
to see the imprint you'd leave!

514
00:38:44,886 --> 00:38:48,156
And when Milena banged against
the wall with the sled, remember?

515
00:38:48,157 --> 00:38:52,403
Well, there's nothing to laugh about!
3 cracked ribs, because of these idiots.

516
00:38:52,404 --> 00:38:55,735
And the poor Cesira below,
who didn't come at the window

517
00:38:55,736 --> 00:38:58,296
fearing the snowballs from Alessandro!

518
00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:04,250
How good was the snow in a glass,
with a drop of marsala.

519
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:07,668
Come on, pull! Go! Pull harder!

520
00:39:17,336 --> 00:39:20,373
Feel how this nectar
on the snow warms you up!

521
00:39:20,378 --> 00:39:23,108
There you go! I told you you'd get hurt!

522
00:39:24,451 --> 00:39:26,590
We're okay, don't worry!

523
00:39:26,605 --> 00:39:29,824
Put some more, come on!
- You like it, eh?

524
00:39:34,043 --> 00:39:37,581
That's it. No, It's not convincing.
The last touch. Watch.

525
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,925
That's it. Wait. There you go.

526
00:39:42,294 --> 00:39:45,586
- Alfredo!
- It's nothing, ma, come on! It's a game.

527
00:39:45,587 --> 00:39:49,808
<i>Now you gotta pull me, eh?
- Okay, Lina. Come on, sit.</i>

528
00:39:55,173 --> 00:39:56,697
<i>The wine hurts!</i>

529
00:39:57,218 --> 00:39:58,662
How rude!

530
00:39:58,703 --> 00:40:00,546
Again? Let's defend ourselves!

531
00:40:00,574 --> 00:40:02,110
Watch behind you!

532
00:40:03,503 --> 00:40:05,277
Who's that, Cardellini?

533
00:40:07,145 --> 00:40:10,753
771row you <i>too, come</i> on!
- Let's go, Saverio, they're crazy!

534
00:40:10,754 --> 00:40:13,405
Mad, mad! They're all mad!

535
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,652
- Shoot them!
- Go, Gina, go!

536
00:40:17,145 --> 00:40:18,988
Let's bombard them!

537
00:40:19,531 --> 00:40:21,533
Ah, we're under fire, huh?

538
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:26,640
Back in the cage!

539
00:40:27,139 --> 00:40:29,209
- Not this, eh?
- Take this!

540
00:40:29,711 --> 00:40:31,190
Go, Lina, go!

541
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,435
Ah, women too, now?

542
00:40:40,884 --> 00:40:42,067
Get this!

543
00:40:42,394 --> 00:40:45,283
You want war? And war will be!

544
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,580
My God. My head froze!

545
00:41:06,748 --> 00:41:08,534
<i>White flag!</i>

546
00:41:10,237 --> 00:41:13,502
<i>Victory! Lf/cto/y! ViClv/V/</i>

547
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:20,057
<i>After dinner; the Carde//ini
family would come to visit.</i>

548
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:24,880
<i>At home they always said that Mr Carde/lini
had spent all his money in Rome</i>

549
00:41:24,963 --> 00:41:26,567
<i>on women and cards,</i>

550
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:31,218
<i>and that for this his wife Ersilia
had clung onto the gas pipe seven times.</i>

551
00:41:33,385 --> 00:41:36,252
<i>Cesira, their only daughter,
is unmarried,</i>

552
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,395
<i>and teaches catechism
in St Lucy's oratory.</i>

553
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:43,867
<i>But everyone said that she's always
been in love with uncle Alfredo.</i>

554
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:46,245
Come, Cesira, come, come.

555
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:52,329
- I open with 1,000.
- I fold.

556
00:41:53,877 --> 00:41:57,847
Good to know, lawyer Colacioppo!
He too belongs to the "parish".

557
00:41:57,948 --> 00:41:59,745
With a wife and children.

558
00:42:01,122 --> 00:42:04,910
That's why he often travels to the north.
Call them inquiries!

559
00:42:04,991 --> 00:42:08,708
And in fact he does his "inquiries".
In the stations' restrooms.

560
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:10,609
- I fold.
- Are you sure?

561
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:15,194
Then ask Alfredo,
who saw him with his own eyes

562
00:42:15,513 --> 00:42:18,961
in the restrooms of Milan station.
What's there to say more?

563
00:42:18,962 --> 00:42:22,147
And yet his wife is a nice mare!
Eight thousand.

564
00:42:22,742 --> 00:42:26,986
Buddy, when you love the cob,
you can even have Sophia Loren close by,

565
00:42:26,987 --> 00:42:29,171
you can figure it out. Call.

566
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,432
A nice shuffle... Attention!

567
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:35,868
I'm opening with number... 79!

568
00:42:35,966 --> 00:42:37,092
What?

569
00:42:37,921 --> 00:42:40,742
What came out?
- 7-9. Here is the number.

570
00:42:40,974 --> 00:42:45,911
<i>Grandma Letizia is the mother of Camiilo.
95 years oid, and an iron heart.</i>

571
00:42:46,224 --> 00:42:50,763
<i>Locked up in a rest home for 20 years,
she's let out only for the holidays.</i>

572
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:55,343
Attention! Here it is.
- listen, the 51 came out? The 51?

573
00:42:55,344 --> 00:42:57,858
6-4, sixty four!

574
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,163
Attention!

575
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:06,874
I cannot live in that home.
It's so ugly!

576
00:43:07,089 --> 00:43:09,000
What nuisance am I at home?

577
00:43:09,022 --> 00:43:11,684
Put in a good word for me, you too!

578
00:43:13,661 --> 00:43:16,494
Here it is! - So then?
- I'm not telling.

579
00:43:16,779 --> 00:43:19,316
Thirty seven, 3-7!

580
00:43:19,524 --> 00:43:22,038
Three numbers win!
- What win, dad!

581
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:26,416
Alfredo, check it out:
2, 26, 37.

582
00:43:26,417 --> 00:43:27,839
Good, they're out.

583
00:43:27,876 --> 00:43:31,539
Of course, dad! I already had
5 winners earlier! Come on!

584
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,941
OK, look, let's make him happy.

585
00:43:35,177 --> 00:43:38,715
Did you see? - Bravo!
- Let's go on for the four numbers win.

586
00:43:40,175 --> 00:43:43,872
No further bets!
Ask, call, the number will come out!

587
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,538
Hop! Uh-oh!

588
00:43:48,614 --> 00:43:50,855
- What is it?
- The age of Cesira.

589
00:43:51,789 --> 00:43:53,268
18!

590
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:57,269
- 18?
- Attention!

591
00:43:58,875 --> 00:44:02,676
Four winners! - How can that be? What? Oh, no!
- Come on, dad!

592
00:44:02,677 --> 00:44:06,036
<i>Women, get ready!
It is almost midnight!</i>

593
00:44:06,037 --> 00:44:08,948
What do we do?
- Well, leave everything as is.

594
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:14,057
No, split the money! - No. We'll play after Mass. I'll keep it
- Mum, let's get ready.

595
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:35,931
How does it fit?

596
00:44:37,421 --> 00:44:40,037
I think the other fits you better.
- Yes?

597
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:42,143
- Right, mum?
- Yes

598
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:46,044
Let me see!

599
00:44:47,731 --> 00:44:48,914
Look!

600
00:44:49,526 --> 00:44:53,028
The smell of when I was little!
- Let me try it on, I beg you!

601
00:44:53,029 --> 00:44:56,406
Now you too must a apply a bit of this.
- The lipstick?

602
00:44:56,407 --> 00:45:00,519
No, no! - Or else you won't come out with us tonight!
- No, God forbid!

603
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:04,843
I never liked this stuff. Are you mad?
You wanna make people laugh?

604
00:45:04,943 --> 00:45:08,885
Good heavens, no! Forget it!
I've never done these things!

605
00:45:08,886 --> 00:45:13,353
Mum? Can you put me the bow tie?
- Let go... - Mum has to put on lipstick.

606
00:45:13,354 --> 00:45:17,859
I'll do it, I'll do it.
- Good, Alfredo! You take care of it. - Come here!

607
00:45:18,145 --> 00:45:21,160
But what are we doing?
- Hold still, quiet!

608
00:45:21,162 --> 00:45:23,141
Do like that! That's it.

609
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:26,698
Hold still!
The lipstick suits you just fine.

610
00:45:27,842 --> 00:45:31,733
<i>What-t going on? Are you ready or not?</i>
- Look <i>how mum looks good!</i>

611
00:45:31,957 --> 00:45:34,255
How pretty is mummy!

612
00:45:34,361 --> 00:45:36,147
Give me a peck, mummy!

613
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,954
You're so beautiful!
- She left you a mark. - Let me

614
00:45:41,054 --> 00:45:43,352
Milena, can you put me the bow tie?

615
00:45:44,424 --> 00:45:45,789
Well fight, eh?

616
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:48,830
Are you girls ready?

617
00:45:51,785 --> 00:45:54,959
Just a moment.
Alfredo, pass me the jacket, please?

618
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,523
<i>Here we are! We are ready!</i>

619
00:46:03,697 --> 00:46:05,642
But... What did you wear?

620
00:46:07,433 --> 00:46:10,823
If I don't wear it on Christmas,
when will I wear it?

621
00:46:11,261 --> 00:46:12,831
But is it Carnival?

622
00:46:13,002 --> 00:46:16,220
Oh, merciful God!
Go take that off immediately.

623
00:46:16,221 --> 00:46:18,223
Alright, let him be, come on!

624
00:46:18,547 --> 00:46:21,835
Shall we make people laugh
right on Christmas night?

625
00:46:23,792 --> 00:46:24,861
Why?

626
00:46:26,944 --> 00:46:30,414
"Used to obey in silence!"

627
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:35,097
This is our motto!

628
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,639
<i>Merry Christmas!
- Best wishes, doctor!</i>

629
00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:44,334
<i>And of course, at the midnight mass,
there were all the town's families.</i>

630
00:46:44,386 --> 00:46:48,490
<i>Cipolloni, Maranga,
Marciani, Colacioppo,</i>

631
00:46:48,491 --> 00:46:50,561
<i>Pozzolini and Mazzocconi.</i>

632
00:46:52,901 --> 00:46:55,813
Look at that!
So big, and is with that shorty.

633
00:46:56,852 --> 00:47:00,219
Low bottom, deeper hole,
they say in Milan!

634
00:47:02,847 --> 00:47:07,227
<i>Isn't he ashamed? 20 years in college
and he hasn't graduated yet!</i>

635
00:47:07,383 --> 00:47:10,282
<i>A wife, two twins,
and parents supporting them.</i>

636
00:47:10,283 --> 00:47:12,763
<i>Happy Holidays!
- Also to your wife.</i>

637
00:47:12,889 --> 00:47:16,833
<i>You saw how beautiful is the daughter of Barbieri?
- For God's sake!</i>

638
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,155
<i>Shek fuii of silicone like her mother!</i>

639
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,033
<i>Beautiful woman,</i>

640
00:47:21,069 --> 00:47:24,755
<i>the wife of lawyer Colacioppi.
- Lucky him who can savor her.</i>

641
00:47:25,448 --> 00:47:30,340
<i>Sooner done than said, Mrs Trozi
managed to get her son a jab at the county!</i>

642
00:47:30,409 --> 00:47:33,014
<i>Through the union?
- No, the Minister.</i>

643
00:47:33,021 --> 00:47:36,297
<i>Merry Christmas! - Same to you.
- Best wishes, Sir!</i>

644
00:47:36,481 --> 00:47:39,803
<i>Dear lady!
- You see the commissioner of public works?</i>

645
00:47:39,867 --> 00:47:43,432
<i>He was so much a Communist,
but after his wife cuckolded him,</i>

646
00:47:43,433 --> 00:47:45,094
<i>he became Socialist.</i>

647
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,372
<i>Merry Christmas, Sir.
- Tomorrow.</i>

648
00:47:47,648 --> 00:47:50,788
<i>Look who's back! Rosa Giannetta.</i>

649
00:47:51,043 --> 00:47:54,297
She arrived up to Saudi Arabia
to do the hooker.

650
00:47:54,589 --> 00:47:57,137
At least she has traveled the world.

651
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:00,978
<i>Yeah, she mews khe 'ms and outs'.
- Greetings, lawyer.</i>

652
00:49:06,847 --> 00:49:11,409
<i>In the name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i>

653
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:15,146
<i>The</i> Lord be <i>with you.</i>
- <i>And Mb'! Your spirit.</i>

654
00:49:18,976 --> 00:49:20,523
Save', sit down.

655
00:49:23,946 --> 00:49:27,018
I confess to God Father the almighty,

656
00:49:27,424 --> 00:49:31,508
and to the blessed Mary ever virgin,
that I have sinned greatly,

657
00:49:31,728 --> 00:49:35,334
in my thought,
in my words, in my deeds,

658
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:41,886
through my fault, through my fault,
through my most grievous fault.

659
00:49:46,863 --> 00:49:48,273
Dad! Sit down.

660
00:49:50,394 --> 00:49:54,694
Word of <i>the</i> Lord.
<i>- Praised be Jesus Christ:</i>

661
00:50:00,666 --> 00:50:04,204
In watching television,
and reading newspapers,

662
00:50:05,167 --> 00:50:08,239
we learn about the many
bad things of this world.

663
00:50:08,627 --> 00:50:12,420
Wars, famine, pestilence,
murder, disease, destruction,

664
00:50:12,421 --> 00:50:14,844
devastation, fires, homicides!..

665
00:50:16,342 --> 00:50:21,097
Disasters, extortion, racketeering, kidnapping,
prostitution, corruption and lust.

666
00:50:22,479 --> 00:50:26,313
But today, we find out
that God truly loves us,

667
00:50:26,897 --> 00:50:29,434
and doesn't leave us alone
at the mercy of evil.

668
00:50:29,445 --> 00:50:33,370
Next to us, in addition to the
Holy Father, he sends us Jesus.

669
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:37,969
And Jesus is not afraid to be born in this
world with so many unpleasant aspects.

670
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:42,930
Indeed, as every year,
he comes back, to make it better.

671
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:49,940
He is born in a humble hut.
Next to him there are only Mary and Joseph.

672
00:50:49,997 --> 00:50:53,370
He is welcomed and visited
by poor people, shepherds,

673
00:50:53,371 --> 00:50:55,874
people by the simple heart and helpful.

674
00:50:56,227 --> 00:50:57,364
And so, ..

675
00:50:57,871 --> 00:51:02,370
To prepare for Christmas, you don't need
to turn on many lights along the roads,

676
00:51:02,371 --> 00:51:04,316
or buy gifts and new things!

677
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:16,871
And now that we've looked
deep in our heart,

678
00:51:17,717 --> 00:51:20,174
let us look in the back of the church,

679
00:51:20,357 --> 00:51:23,872
where is starting to take shape
the mystery of God.

680
00:51:25,294 --> 00:51:28,718
The mystery of love,
of God that comes to us.

681
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,619
He will be the hope of our hope;

682
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:36,279
the life of our life.

683
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,533
Behold!

684
00:51:42,304 --> 00:51:43,384
Here is...

685
00:51:43,699 --> 00:51:46,884
From the depths of humankind,
He advances.

686
00:51:47,584 --> 00:51:49,973
Listen to the echo of his footsteps!

687
00:51:49,992 --> 00:51:51,675
By day and by night,

688
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:55,271
from age to age, at any time,

689
00:51:56,023 --> 00:51:57,479
He advances...

690
00:51:58,254 --> 00:51:59,755
He advances...

691
00:52:00,788 --> 00:52:02,392
He advances...

692
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:46,116
<i>Turn on the lights to feast!</i>

693
00:52:46,473 --> 00:52:48,498
<i>The Lord is born for us!</i>

694
00:52:49,227 --> 00:52:51,878
And now, all of us, lined up,

695
00:52:52,428 --> 00:52:55,306
we will give Him a token of our affection.

696
00:53:18,591 --> 00:53:19,797
Save', move!

697
00:53:22,414 --> 00:53:27,590
<i>And as always, during the night, everyone
went to lay their gifb under the tree.</i>

698
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:31,352
<i>In short,
as if Santa Claus had actually come.</i>

699
00:53:32,517 --> 00:53:34,565
Alfredo, what's your gift?

700
00:53:34,592 --> 00:53:38,039
It's a secret. You'll see tomorrow.
- Eh, Alfredo! - Hello mum.

701
00:53:38,861 --> 00:53:41,864
Ah, you too? Lina, come.

702
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:45,168
You put your gift?
- I'm going to take that of Monica.

703
00:53:48,631 --> 00:53:51,099
Don't make noise!
- It didn't break.

704
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:53,726
Milena, careful! You'll wake up the kids!

705
00:53:57,122 --> 00:53:58,965
Gimme a kiss!

706
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:05,182
You saw how many beautiful gifts, Trieste?

707
00:54:05,186 --> 00:54:07,802
Fantastic, fantastic, oh mother!

708
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:41,651
If you knew how much snow fell!

709
00:54:41,669 --> 00:54:45,161
Stay under, stay covered, nice and warm.
Don't move.

710
00:54:45,521 --> 00:54:48,570
Now grandma will bring
you breakfast in bed.

711
00:55:00,885 --> 00:55:05,299
Hey! Merry Christmas, my darling.
- Holy Mother, how cold!

712
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:09,536
When will you buy a gas stove?
Just one. Huh?

713
00:55:09,697 --> 00:55:12,963
You can carry it around the house,
as with the brazier.

714
00:55:12,964 --> 00:55:16,593
Shall we make another expense?
- Michele thinks the same!

715
00:55:16,738 --> 00:55:19,810
Look, go wash up,
or else you'll have to queue.

716
00:55:20,572 --> 00:55:23,188
That icy water!
- Merry Christmas, Lina.

717
00:55:23,288 --> 00:55:25,051
Same to you. How cold!

718
00:55:26,184 --> 00:55:27,446
Merry Christmas, mum.

719
00:55:27,485 --> 00:55:30,329
Merry Christmas to you too, Alessandro.

720
00:55:30,336 --> 00:55:32,748
You could have stayed in bed a while.

721
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,470
- It's Christmas!
- With flakes!

722
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:47,496
- Good morning.
- Morning.

723
00:55:47,532 --> 00:55:49,921
Good morning, dear.
- Hi, Milena.

724
00:55:51,435 --> 00:55:54,370
Merry Christmas, mama.
- Merry Christmas to you too.

725
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:04,868
You know who I dreamed of last night?
- Who?

726
00:56:05,802 --> 00:56:08,145
Sometimes dreams are just crazy.

727
00:56:09,143 --> 00:56:14,274
I dreamed of grandma Annina, who was
lying in the midst of a wheat field,

728
00:56:14,521 --> 00:56:17,046
and I got close and asked her:

729
00:56:17,354 --> 00:56:20,255
"Granny, what are you
doing here all alone?"

730
00:56:20,725 --> 00:56:23,114
And she, holding my hand, told me:

731
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:27,651
"Milena, help me! I fell!"

732
00:56:28,348 --> 00:56:34,730
And I: "How did you fall?"
And she: "I fell from an elephant!"

733
00:56:35,045 --> 00:56:36,842
And why from an elephant?

734
00:56:37,054 --> 00:56:38,703
Mum, I don't know.

735
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:43,194
Dreams are like that.
I don't know why from an elephant.

736
00:56:43,524 --> 00:56:46,960
Good morning! - Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas, mum.

737
00:56:46,999 --> 00:56:48,682
- Hi.
- Alfredino!

738
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,594
What a cold, guys!

739
00:56:54,237 --> 00:56:56,888
Mum, for me only a little barley.

740
00:56:56,896 --> 00:56:59,922
I'll put in a drop of coffee,
so it picks you up.

741
00:56:59,928 --> 00:57:03,773
Just a drop.
- Mum, would you give me a cup to bring it to Gina?

742
00:57:04,567 --> 00:57:07,195
She's used to have breakfast in bed.

743
00:57:07,449 --> 00:57:11,067
Lucky her,
who found someone who brings it to her!

744
00:57:12,943 --> 00:57:16,731
Mum, can I have some tea, please?
- I'll fix it right away.

745
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:20,408
- It's for Gina?
- Yes.

746
00:57:22,173 --> 00:57:23,208
Thanks!

747
00:57:23,413 --> 00:57:27,253
Dad is already up?
- No! The later he gets up, the better it is.

748
00:57:27,254 --> 00:57:28,334
<i>Grandpa!</i>

749
00:57:29,065 --> 00:57:30,225
Ah! He's up!

750
00:57:30,267 --> 00:57:33,998
Grandpa! - Come on, dad! Open up!
- Grandpa, will you open it?

751
00:57:34,436 --> 00:57:37,200
Grandpa, open up!
- Come on, dad, come out!

752
00:57:37,656 --> 00:57:40,250
Saverio, come out!
It's an order!

753
00:57:46,792 --> 00:57:49,226
One must respect one's own turn.

754
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:52,257
So says the regulation of the Corps.

755
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:24,903
You too like Mina?
- Of course! How couldn't I?

756
00:58:24,978 --> 00:58:29,688
To me, she's unique. Well, I also like
Battisti, De Gregori, Dalla... But she...

757
00:58:30,284 --> 00:58:34,926
Maybe because she helped me to overcome
some difficult times of my life.

758
00:58:35,103 --> 00:58:36,593
Think that once...

759
00:58:37,087 --> 00:58:40,496
I was with someone, and I didn't
know whether to end everything.

760
00:58:40,497 --> 00:58:43,474
You know, when a story takes a bad turn...
- Eh!

761
00:58:43,475 --> 00:58:47,400
Well, I went to buy her latest LP,
I'd never heard it.

762
00:58:47,585 --> 00:58:52,150
I played it, and as if on purpose,
there was a song titled "More, more".

763
00:58:52,151 --> 00:58:54,381
It seemed written specially for me!

764
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,291
Hearing her say "More, more,
I still love you"

765
00:58:58,449 --> 00:59:01,881
suddenly I realized I still
loved this person, that was it.

766
00:59:01,882 --> 00:59:06,833
Thank God they all went out! When they're
at home, you can't get anything done!

767
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:11,487
For goodness sake! As time passes they
become ever more boring, and useless.

768
00:59:11,505 --> 00:59:15,863
Quite right that guy on TV who says you
should change partners every 3. 5 years.

769
00:59:15,864 --> 00:59:16,819
Who?

770
00:59:16,865 --> 00:59:21,757
That nice guy who's always in the "Maurizio
Consianzo Show", what's his name...

771
00:59:21,906 --> 00:59:26,616
Sgarbi. He says that after 3 and a half
years you become like brother and sister.

772
00:59:26,673 --> 00:59:28,345
I think he's right.

773
00:59:28,987 --> 00:59:32,190
True, once in a while
you need a new boost of life!

774
00:59:32,191 --> 00:59:37,811
Eh, what should I say then, who for over 60
years I've been with that pain in the neck!

775
00:59:37,886 --> 00:59:41,754
Mum, you should've thought of it earlier.
- True! I was idiot!

776
00:59:49,347 --> 00:59:53,943
Mama? Where is the maraschino? - There isn't.
- What do you mean, there isn't?

777
00:59:54,436 --> 00:59:56,609
Alfredo, I forgot to buy it.

778
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:59,224
How can I make maraschino cream
without maraschino?

779
00:59:59,237 --> 01:00:02,092
A tangerine liqueur isn't the same thing?

780
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:06,750
A tangerine liqueur? You heard? I should
make maraschino cream with tangerine?

781
01:00:06,751 --> 01:00:08,844
So? It'll taste like tangerine!

782
01:00:09,279 --> 01:00:12,589
And where is it?
- In the cabinet of the living room.

783
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:43,760
<i>And as every year, on Christmas
morning, Dad forced us to go</i>

784
01:00:43,761 --> 01:00:45,979
<i>looking for some poor bird.</i>

785
01:00:53,072 --> 01:00:57,475
Come with daddy, come. This year
there must have been the repopulation.

786
01:00:59,362 --> 01:01:02,294
<i>Before Christmas lunch,
there was a gifls exchange.</i>

787
01:01:02,295 --> 01:01:06,413
Mama! This is on the part of all of us.
- It's nice, isn't it?

788
01:01:06,658 --> 01:01:08,137
You shouldn't have!

789
01:01:09,438 --> 01:01:12,009
Grandpa, there's for you too.
Mauro.

790
01:01:14,334 --> 01:01:17,087
<i>Thank you. That was very nice.</i>

791
01:01:19,068 --> 01:01:20,933
<i>Watch Saverio, he's so...</i>

792
01:01:21,115 --> 01:01:24,255
<i>Best wishes, Dad!
- Merry Christmas!</i>

793
01:01:26,127 --> 01:01:28,641
<i>Now we can even go skiing!</i>

794
01:01:28,867 --> 01:01:30,789
<i>Look how elastic they are!</i>

795
01:01:30,817 --> 01:01:33,058
God, how beautiful!

796
01:01:33,232 --> 01:01:37,987
For years I've looked for a gown in this
color, and I've never managed to find it!

797
01:01:38,272 --> 01:01:42,049
And now you come, and... Thank you!
- Don't mention it!

798
01:01:42,356 --> 01:01:44,529
- It's splendid!
- Best wishes.

799
01:01:44,797 --> 01:01:47,880
Milena, here, this is for you.
- Thanks.

800
01:01:48,399 --> 01:01:51,755
Wait, I'll give you mine.
Wait, let me look for it...

801
01:01:53,886 --> 01:01:57,105
So you can buy what you want.
- Thank you, grandma.

802
01:01:57,598 --> 01:01:59,577
Here it is! Best wishes.

803
01:02:06,533 --> 01:02:07,898
N000!

804
01:02:12,759 --> 01:02:13,896
Best wishes!

805
01:02:13,945 --> 01:02:15,230
Thank you!

806
01:02:20,523 --> 01:02:24,402
This way I can make a matching set!
What a nice idea!

807
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:28,415
I already got one!
- What is it? - When you speak, it moves.

808
01:02:29,141 --> 01:02:30,824
Hello! You like it?

809
01:02:31,933 --> 01:02:34,584
It's yours if you want it.
- Thank you.

810
01:02:37,738 --> 01:02:38,818
Coke!

811
01:02:40,685 --> 01:02:44,200
<i>Goodbye. - 771$ k branded, it takes black shoes
- Lina!</i>

812
01:02:44,397 --> 01:02:45,591
Best wishes!

813
01:02:47,084 --> 01:02:48,517
It's a corkscrew.

814
01:02:49,441 --> 01:02:52,365
It's a refined object for classy people.

815
01:02:53,491 --> 01:02:54,788
You like it?

816
01:02:56,545 --> 01:02:58,433
You have fulfilled a dream.

817
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:02,589
You can't understand how this
pen can be useful to me. Yup!

818
01:03:02,978 --> 01:03:06,491
<i>Now let's clear out quickly,
it's almost time for lunch.</i>

819
01:03:06,492 --> 01:03:08,392
Yes! Wait a second!

820
01:03:14,069 --> 01:03:15,707
Group photo!

821
01:03:15,982 --> 01:03:19,861
Everybody ready,
for the rite of the photograph!

822
01:03:20,347 --> 01:03:21,803
- Ready?
- Wait!

823
01:03:21,843 --> 01:03:24,846
Here we go, we're ready.
But let's put me too.

824
01:03:24,979 --> 01:03:28,885
Are we all?
- No, not all, I'm missing! Here, focusing. . Ready!

825
01:03:28,886 --> 01:03:31,662
Self-timer... Go!

826
01:03:32,388 --> 01:03:34,652
Move over, move over... Smile!

827
01:03:35,628 --> 01:03:38,210
But where... - Hurry up!
- One moment!

828
01:03:40,248 --> 01:03:42,853
You took me just as I turned!
- No, I...

829
01:03:44,048 --> 01:03:48,917
Dear Romans, Italians...
A happy and holy Christmas to you...

830
01:03:49,336 --> 01:03:52,885
May the peace of Christ the Savior
reign in your hearts...

831
01:03:55,282 --> 01:03:57,034
and in your families...

832
01:04:04,556 --> 01:04:08,208
Seen that today is
such a beautiful day,

833
01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:11,434
I also want to tell you
something important.

834
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:16,350
Since some time I wanted to tell you.
But then, today passes, and tomorrow too...

835
01:04:17,399 --> 01:04:18,935
But today I decided.

836
01:04:19,324 --> 01:04:24,023
And if Trieste makes a decision,
that's that! A true Abruzzese, stubborn!

837
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:26,616
What's there to say that's so important?

838
01:04:26,634 --> 01:04:31,026
We thought that we want to spend
the few days that we still have to live

839
01:04:31,027 --> 01:04:32,722
closer to you.

840
01:04:32,878 --> 01:04:35,813
- I like this.
- Good idea!

841
01:04:36,031 --> 01:04:40,701
We have always moved away from here,
and you know it, very little.

842
01:04:40,702 --> 01:04:44,445
Eh, yes, we know.
- However, enough now.

843
01:04:44,565 --> 01:04:47,670
Enough with living alone.
- Oh, finally!

844
01:04:47,671 --> 01:04:51,628
I'll say! For 15 years that I've
been married you came to our house

845
01:04:51,629 --> 01:04:53,677
a couple of times at the most.

846
01:04:53,814 --> 01:04:58,299
For how many years I've been telling you?
Go out, what the heck!

847
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:01,747
But that's all we wanted! True, Gina?
- Sure!

848
01:05:01,943 --> 01:05:05,902
How beautiful!
What a wondrous Christmas!

849
01:05:06,095 --> 01:05:10,193
Did you hear, Save'?
And I who thought you wouldn't want us.

850
01:05:10,194 --> 01:05:13,459
But what came on your mind?
- You must be joking!

851
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:17,187
What a great consolation
to have children like you!

852
01:05:17,188 --> 01:05:20,521
We want you, Mum! But how
can you think such things?!

853
01:05:20,596 --> 01:05:22,848
Did you hear? "We don't want you"!

854
01:05:22,866 --> 01:05:26,927
As soon as you decide, tell us,
our home is at your complete disposal.

855
01:05:27,155 --> 01:05:29,157
Now I'm ashamed of myself.

856
01:05:29,326 --> 01:05:33,786
But I'll tell you anyway, because with
you I want to be sincere all the way.

857
01:05:37,038 --> 01:05:39,336
Do you know...
- Come on, tell us!

858
01:05:39,765 --> 01:05:42,928
Do you know that I had
even considered a rest home?

859
01:05:52,928 --> 01:05:56,955
But... A rest home?
What has to do the rest home?

860
01:05:57,322 --> 01:06:01,304
But when I went there,
and I've smelled that odor of old,

861
01:06:01,774 --> 01:06:05,699
I've felt like a block here,
in the pit of the stomach.

862
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:10,910
Also because I, alone,
the responsibility to care for her,

863
01:06:11,562 --> 01:06:13,610
I can not take it!

864
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:19,175
Mind you, not that I don't want to take it.
I just cannot take it.

865
01:06:19,297 --> 01:06:22,787
Because I have my work.
I have to study English.

866
01:06:22,788 --> 01:06:26,929
Soon they will open the frontiers.
So, I will not have time.

867
01:06:28,595 --> 01:06:31,940
And indeed another reason
is precisely him.

868
01:06:32,675 --> 01:06:36,350
Something may happen to us
at any moment.

869
01:06:36,594 --> 01:06:40,337
And here, living alone,
who will see us, who will hear us?

870
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:42,190
But what may ever happen?

871
01:06:42,216 --> 01:06:45,333
And now the question arises
with who go to live.

872
01:06:47,082 --> 01:06:50,973
But I'll tell you right now that
being shuttled among my children

873
01:06:51,067 --> 01:06:55,583
like a parcel, God forbid! It makes
me laugh. Going here, then there...

874
01:06:55,901 --> 01:06:58,222
But can you picture the two of us?..

875
01:06:58,607 --> 01:07:00,347
Rome, Como, Modena...

876
01:07:00,619 --> 01:07:02,223
For God's sake!

877
01:07:03,271 --> 01:07:06,035
So I thought that
ifs up to you to decide.

878
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:08,860
Of course I wasn't born yesterday,

879
01:07:09,294 --> 01:07:12,411
and I know that we will give
a bit of nuisance.

880
01:07:13,267 --> 01:07:17,465
Therefore I decided that, besides
to half the pension that we will give

881
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:20,996
to who takes us with him,
we'll give him also the house.

882
01:07:21,127 --> 01:07:23,698
It's not a great capital, however...

883
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:26,353
that's all we own.

884
01:07:27,281 --> 01:07:28,555
Isn't it so?

885
01:07:29,383 --> 01:07:32,967
Now you think it over, talk about it,
do your calculations...

886
01:07:33,337 --> 01:07:36,204
and when you take a decision,
you'll tell us.

887
01:07:36,935 --> 01:07:39,904
Calmly. No one is chasing us.

888
01:07:41,435 --> 01:07:45,223
On the other hand,
we can't move now with the cold.

889
01:07:45,379 --> 01:07:46,630
<i>Of course not.</i>

890
01:07:46,759 --> 01:07:50,934
In spring, God willing.
When the weather warms up.

891
01:07:51,531 --> 01:07:53,408
Apr", May...

892
01:07:53,905 --> 01:07:56,794
- May, June...
- If God will!

893
01:07:59,198 --> 01:08:01,246
<i>We“, bun appefit, eh?</i>

894
01:08:01,733 --> 01:08:03,906
<i>Ban appetit...</i>

895
01:08:13,748 --> 01:08:15,545
Why Alfredo didn't come?

896
01:08:15,737 --> 01:08:18,968
He said he'd come later,
was helping mum to tidy up.

897
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:22,477
Why don't you go play with the machines?
- Mum, I don't like them.

898
01:08:22,478 --> 01:08:25,276
Then go make a snowman,
later we'll come to see it.

899
01:08:25,284 --> 01:08:27,605
Love, go and play with Mauro you too.

900
01:08:27,623 --> 01:08:29,124
I don't want to go.

901
01:08:29,163 --> 01:08:33,213
Then go get a chocolate zuocotto,
they make them delicious here.

902
01:08:33,473 --> 01:08:34,588
Good girl!

903
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:44,022
Guys, let's be clear.

904
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:48,805
The only one who can really take care
of our loved ones, is precisely Alfredo.

905
01:08:48,908 --> 01:08:50,785
I regret he's not here...

906
01:08:52,249 --> 01:08:53,341
Alfredo?!

907
01:08:53,387 --> 01:08:57,118
Excuse me, but how can you
entrust two elders to a single man?

908
01:08:57,157 --> 01:08:58,272
Look, Gina,

909
01:08:58,387 --> 01:09:02,168
if you allow, it's up to us of the family
to decide what we can or can't do.

910
01:09:02,169 --> 01:09:06,139
Indeed, Lina is perfectly right.
Of course! Who better than him?

911
01:09:06,287 --> 01:09:09,256
He's single, with no wife,
no children, free...

912
01:09:09,324 --> 01:09:13,861
Mum can fix him meals, so he'll find a
hot plate when he returns from work...

913
01:09:13,862 --> 01:09:15,329
- Antonio!
- Yes?

914
01:09:15,364 --> 01:09:19,147
For me no coffee, better a Sambuca.
Therefore, just one coffee.

915
01:09:19,148 --> 01:09:21,525
- Decaffeinated!
- And a grappa..

916
01:09:21,777 --> 01:09:26,077
And for the pension, even if only half,
ifs still a nice nest egg, right?

917
01:09:26,119 --> 01:09:29,691
You may not be aware, but
the Corps got some good increases.

918
01:09:30,039 --> 01:09:34,464
And what about the house?
That too is a nice capital. Nowadays...

919
01:09:34,808 --> 01:09:38,653
Certainly, whatever the two of them
decide, God forbid. However,

920
01:09:38,751 --> 01:09:41,868
also the house?
To me it seems a little excessive...

921
01:09:42,385 --> 01:09:44,762
- Don't you think?
- Sure, sure...

922
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:49,353
You're right, Lina. And then,
it's not even for the capital, but ifs...

923
01:09:49,509 --> 01:09:52,910
it's for a sentimental fact,
of affection, let's say.

924
01:09:54,043 --> 01:09:58,161
Having a hearth, a point of reference
for the family, ifs important.

925
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:02,084
Michele, this is up to us to say.
We were born and raised there.

926
01:10:02,382 --> 01:10:07,319
But I'm sure that Alfredo will understand.
Mum said so just to say, for sensitivity.

927
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:09,724
Alfredo will never accept the house!

928
01:10:09,916 --> 01:10:12,872
After all, we're offering him
a good opportunity.

929
01:10:12,873 --> 01:10:17,253
Didn't he always say that he can't bear
to stay away from Mum and Dad? So?

930
01:10:18,536 --> 01:10:23,917
Say what you will, however,
not seeing mum and dad into our house...

931
01:10:24,305 --> 01:10:25,954
it shatters my heart!

932
01:10:26,203 --> 01:10:27,795
Don't do that, honey.

933
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:31,712
After all, they'll stay with your brother,
not with a stranger, right?

934
01:10:32,043 --> 01:10:37,242
But it will all end, you see? Christmas
will end, the joy of these days will end!

935
01:10:37,561 --> 01:10:39,609
We've always been so united.

936
01:10:39,826 --> 01:10:45,082
Now mum and dad need our help,
and they come to ask us. My God!

937
01:10:48,172 --> 01:10:51,915
Filippo! Let go of my hand,
I can't stir the cappuccino.

938
01:10:53,247 --> 01:10:55,499
They even considered a rest home.

939
01:10:56,621 --> 01:10:58,304
I can't believe it!

940
01:10:59,434 --> 01:11:00,958
She even checked one!

941
01:11:00,996 --> 01:11:04,864
Lina, please, don't say such things!
You know they hurt me!

942
01:11:06,176 --> 01:11:11,625
In pondering, I've come up with a trifle.
As for the house, we'll see what to do.

943
01:11:12,062 --> 01:11:14,155
But the stuff that's in there?

944
01:11:14,835 --> 01:11:19,989
But the donation of the house doesn't also
include what's inside. Eh, it would be nice!

945
01:11:20,747 --> 01:11:24,331
Because inside there are some
little things not bad at all.

946
01:11:24,493 --> 01:11:25,983
The TV set, is new.

947
01:11:26,223 --> 01:11:29,181
And the washer that
we gave them last year?

948
01:11:29,341 --> 01:11:32,105
It's new.
Then it has that program for delicate...

949
01:11:32,115 --> 01:11:36,202
Then sorry, but I'd like to anticipate
something, since we're on topic.

950
01:11:36,203 --> 01:11:40,185
Because in that house there's one thing
that really makes me die for!

951
01:11:40,521 --> 01:11:41,636
Which one?

952
01:11:42,726 --> 01:11:43,897
The dresser.

953
01:11:44,512 --> 01:11:46,195
The one in the hallway?

954
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:48,668
Yes.
- The one of Grandma Lisetta?

955
01:11:48,845 --> 01:11:52,444
Yes. - Oh, the one all inlaid,
with a mantle stone on it?

956
01:11:52,445 --> 01:11:56,244
Lina, there's but one dresser,
I really mink she wants that one.

957
01:11:56,245 --> 01:11:59,100
God! How sorry I am, darling!

958
01:11:59,377 --> 01:12:03,154
Fact is, grandma Lisetta gave it
exactly to me prior to her death.

959
01:12:03,898 --> 01:12:08,358
Since, when I was little, I was always
mere in front watching those inlays,

960
01:12:08,672 --> 01:12:11,835
one day she said:
"When you grow up, this will be yours."

961
01:12:12,106 --> 01:12:15,792
Of course, as long as it's used
by mum and dad, God forbid...

962
01:12:16,256 --> 01:12:17,496
But after...

963
01:12:17,779 --> 01:12:21,465
Sorry, Lina, but when grandma died,
weren't you one year old?

964
01:12:22,377 --> 01:12:23,469
Yes.

965
01:12:23,806 --> 01:12:25,546
So how can you remember?

966
01:12:26,656 --> 01:12:29,602
It's the first memory I have.
Indeed, if you ask me

967
01:12:29,609 --> 01:12:33,670
"What is your first memory?", I answer you "This one".
- Fancy that!

968
01:12:34,073 --> 01:12:38,533
I'm rather thinking of Alfredo's face
when we'll give him the good news.

969
01:12:42,099 --> 01:12:43,635
But you're kidding?!

970
01:12:44,491 --> 01:12:46,391
What? You're not happy?

971
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:49,079
Happy?!

972
01:12:50,755 --> 01:12:54,532
But then you're serious! I say,
are you crazy? But what have I to do?

973
01:12:54,633 --> 01:12:58,421
On purpose I didn't come to the bar.
But what came into your mind?

974
01:12:58,554 --> 01:13:01,091
I, a man alone, caring for two old people?

975
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:05,067
Darling, apart that mummy
and daddy are two people

976
01:13:05,181 --> 01:13:08,708
quite easy to manage, and not old,
as you improperly said,

977
01:13:08,904 --> 01:13:12,408
then, if we thought of you,
it's also to do you a favor.

978
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:13,734
A favor?!

979
01:13:13,777 --> 01:13:18,885
Of course. Since they're two people who
not only will make you feel less lonely,

980
01:13:19,038 --> 01:13:22,360
but they'll help you also
from an economic standpoint.

981
01:13:23,247 --> 01:13:25,135
Excuse us if it isn't much.

982
01:13:25,551 --> 01:13:29,294
So, you think I should give up
my life, my independence,

983
01:13:29,509 --> 01:13:33,430
10 years of autogenic training, for these
four walls and a little extra money?

984
01:13:33,431 --> 01:13:37,595
Alfredo, the fact is that you're the
only person without responsibility,

985
01:13:37,811 --> 01:13:39,199
without family.

986
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:41,671
The only one living alone.

987
01:13:41,939 --> 01:13:43,622
But I don't live alone.

988
01:13:44,619 --> 01:13:46,632
- You don't live alone?
- No.

989
01:13:47,315 --> 01:13:49,237
I cohabit since ten years.

990
01:13:49,873 --> 01:13:52,330
But then there are secrets between us!

991
01:13:52,349 --> 01:13:55,307
You're with a woman for 10 years
and you don't tell us?

992
01:13:55,309 --> 01:13:58,051
But, who's she, what does she do,
what's her name?

993
01:13:58,148 --> 01:14:01,197
His name is Mario,
and he's a security guard.

994
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:03,266
Oh God!

995
01:14:04,259 --> 01:14:07,581
Mauro and Monica,
go play in the kitchen please!

996
01:14:08,212 --> 01:14:09,861
The monster is here!

997
01:14:11,892 --> 01:14:16,966
And... and, in all these years, you never
confided with your sisters, your brother?

998
01:14:17,547 --> 01:14:22,348
But how did it happen, Alfredino, eh?
How did it come out, this your diversity?

999
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:26,620
What do you want me to say?
At some point I realized that I liked cock!

1000
01:14:27,326 --> 01:14:29,794
Alfredo, please!
- But why, sorry?

1001
01:14:30,019 --> 01:14:32,897
What did you expect from a child
with a submissive father

1002
01:14:32,902 --> 01:14:36,041
and an overprotective mother, eh?
What did you expect?

1003
01:14:36,042 --> 01:14:39,330
Alfredo, please, mum and dad
may be back any moment!

1004
01:14:39,582 --> 01:14:43,769
Good! So finally they too will know
what they've been able to do!

1005
01:14:43,945 --> 01:14:48,766
Why, sorry? I'm not a half-woman,
and weren't we born of the same parents?

1006
01:14:48,767 --> 01:14:51,793
Alessandro, please!
You might not be a faggot...

1007
01:14:53,285 --> 01:14:55,333
however, you'd better shut up.

1008
01:14:57,388 --> 01:15:00,937
Now I understand why you met
with lawyer Colacioppo...

1009
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,199
in the loos of the station.

1010
01:15:04,317 --> 01:15:05,409
So what?

1011
01:15:07,267 --> 01:15:09,940
Have you seen?
What had I told you?

1012
01:15:10,625 --> 01:15:14,559
In my opinion, there's only one person
who can take care of them, just one.

1013
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,892
And in my opinion that person is you.

1014
01:15:17,215 --> 01:15:18,432
Mel?

1015
01:15:18,477 --> 01:15:20,001
Yes, dearie, yes!

1016
01:15:20,173 --> 01:15:23,535
You're the one who's always been
closer to them, you know them more.

1017
01:15:23,536 --> 01:15:25,970
And then, you're the one living closer.

1018
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:29,824
The moving would be less shocking:
same region, same language...

1019
01:15:30,423 --> 01:15:33,332
Can you imagine those two
poor old people in Modena?

1020
01:15:33,333 --> 01:15:36,279
They wouldn't even dare to go out...
for the trauma.

1021
01:15:36,507 --> 01:15:38,759
Yeah! The Lombard League has come!

1022
01:15:39,374 --> 01:15:42,935
But... But, I for one don't know
where to put my hands!

1023
01:15:43,482 --> 01:15:45,814
Alone in the house with two men...

1024
01:15:46,156 --> 01:15:50,957
I'm out from morning till evening, and
when I'm home, God only knows what I find!

1025
01:15:51,003 --> 01:15:53,858
Without the collaboration of anyone...

1026
01:15:54,284 --> 01:15:57,765
With a nervous breakdown
that's up to the tip of my hair,

1027
01:15:57,842 --> 01:16:01,589
a spastic colitis, and you tell me
to take care of these two poor people?

1028
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,410
But how could you think of it?!

1029
01:16:03,437 --> 01:16:06,643
But you must admit they're
much more attached to you.

1030
01:16:06,644 --> 01:16:08,703
You've always been more present...

1031
01:16:08,725 --> 01:16:12,809
Now you're in it, too? Of course
I was more present, I live closer!

1032
01:16:12,862 --> 01:16:16,928
Then, if you put on this level,
I must tell you that, exactly for this,

1033
01:16:16,929 --> 01:16:19,998
you've always put it in my rear,
with all due respect.

1034
01:16:19,999 --> 01:16:24,572
When dad had a bladder surgery, who did
the nights in the hospital? I, alone!

1035
01:16:24,638 --> 01:16:26,629
Not a dog to replace me!

1036
01:16:26,653 --> 01:16:29,950
But Lina, don't you remember I'd phone
every day to ask if you wanted me

1037
01:16:29,951 --> 01:16:34,051
to come to relieve you? You always said no.
Now, if you want to play the victim..

1038
01:16:34,052 --> 01:16:37,514
I said no because you're a man.
It was your wife who had to come.

1039
01:16:37,515 --> 01:16:39,380
At least she knows how to make a coffee.

1040
01:16:39,405 --> 01:16:43,759
And she had to figure this out,
since she says she has some sensitivity!

1041
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:47,939
But as her sensitivity is only in one
spot... Okay, never mind, ifs better.

1042
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:50,090
Then this speech concerns me too!

1043
01:16:50,109 --> 01:16:51,497
But of course!

1044
01:16:51,704 --> 01:16:54,776
"Poor Milena!", said mum,
"She always calls!"

1045
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:58,213
But the bedpan under dad's ass,
I put myself... my dear!

1046
01:16:58,245 --> 01:17:01,840
For 20 years I've put up with them!
Enough now!

1047
01:17:01,901 --> 01:17:04,472
<i>Now you take them over'.
- You did wrong!</i>

1048
01:17:04,487 --> 01:17:06,671
You shouldn't have clone it.
- Even?

1049
01:17:06,772 --> 01:17:07,875
Certainly!

1050
01:17:08,099 --> 01:17:12,718
Because, by doing so, you've spoiled them,
and now all of us must bear the brunt.

1051
01:17:12,873 --> 01:17:17,446
If they'd been accustomed to living alone,
to rely on their own resources,

1052
01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:20,050
now we wouldn't be talking about it,
don't you mink?

1053
01:17:20,057 --> 01:17:22,059
Filippo is quite right, dear.

1054
01:17:22,077 --> 01:17:25,717
Jesus! Now I should even feel guilty
for having aided them?!

1055
01:17:25,801 --> 01:17:30,012
Well, sadly it's the truth. All of us
have had to adapt to your behavior,

1056
01:17:30,013 --> 01:17:32,675
not to play, us,
the part of the ungrateful.

1057
01:17:32,783 --> 01:17:37,311
It's true! You've acted so
to suck up to mummy and daddy.

1058
01:17:37,424 --> 01:17:39,221
That's why you did it.

1059
01:17:40,981 --> 01:17:42,573
What are you saying?

1060
01:17:45,736 --> 01:17:49,934
What are you saying?
You, who don't even have a family!

1061
01:17:51,103 --> 01:17:53,913
<i>Milena. Alessandro.</i>
- <i>The TV, the</i> TV!

1062
01:17:54,007 --> 01:17:57,647
<i>- Here we are!
- Dollar: 204, 505.</i>

1063
01:17:57,821 --> 01:18:00,845
<i>Ecu: 1535, 450.</i>

1064
01:18:00,846 --> 01:18:02,438
You did well...

1065
01:18:03,253 --> 01:18:06,461
in closing the door.
This way the room stays warm.

1066
01:18:06,715 --> 01:18:08,478
Outside it's freezing cold.

1067
01:18:08,511 --> 01:18:11,514
But how can you, I say,
go out in this cold?

1068
01:18:11,517 --> 01:18:15,738
Ah, even if outside is - 40 °,
I must take my walk!

1069
01:18:15,853 --> 01:18:19,789
Take some air, and work off your thighs!
- Can we come in now?

1070
01:18:21,317 --> 01:18:23,205
Why did you send them away?

1071
01:18:24,012 --> 01:18:27,236
<i>And from that afternoon,
whenever the grandparent went out,</i>

1072
01:18:27,237 --> 01:18:30,513
<i>they shut themselves up in a room
and sent us away.</i>

1073
01:18:31,754 --> 01:18:34,888
And so, when it suits you,
I'm part of the family,

1074
01:18:34,889 --> 01:18:37,710
but when it doesn't,
I'm no longer part, eh?

1075
01:18:38,410 --> 01:18:42,961
Look, cutie, my mother in law, 3 months
after I married, came to stay with me,

1076
01:18:43,072 --> 01:18:46,420
because my husband wanted it so,
and I had to keep quiet.

1077
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:49,390
She kicked the bucket,
or else she'd still be there.

1078
01:18:49,715 --> 01:18:52,650
Anyway, for me, my husband
can do what he wants.

1079
01:18:52,758 --> 01:18:56,035
Just him to know that, no sooner
his parents set foot in my house,

1080
01:18:56,036 --> 01:18:57,890
I'll pack up and leave.

1081
01:19:00,758 --> 01:19:04,683
Again!? But where shall I put them,
if I've no place?

1082
01:19:04,775 --> 01:19:07,426
What no place!
Put Mauro to sleep in the studio!

1083
01:19:07,433 --> 01:19:12,530
And you, with a house of 2,000 sq ft? Not
to mention the terrace. And no children!

1084
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:16,552
You shouldn't have said that!

1085
01:19:18,767 --> 01:19:24,372
<i>Judas! Like the time you found me smoking
with Rosamaria and you ran to tell dad!</i>

1086
01:19:24,373 --> 01:19:27,137
<i>What could I know?
At age five I couldn't!</i>

1087
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:30,770
<i>You knew, you knew! To your advantage,
you always knew everything!</i>

1088
01:19:30,771 --> 01:19:34,559
<i>The truth is that you were jealous of me!
- I, jealous of you!?</i>

1089
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:39,653
<i>Yes! Because I'm tall, slender,
and I've got class!</i>

1090
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:44,601
<i>Nice gratitude! You of ail,
who've always been mum's favorite!</i>

1091
01:19:44,681 --> 01:19:48,117
<i>And if it was not for dad,
you'd have never won the contest!</i>

1092
01:19:48,241 --> 01:19:51,637
<i>Look who's talking,
the communist, the revolutionary...</i>

1093
01:19:51,638 --> 01:19:57,361
<i>But if it was not for my husband and
the D. C., you would be cleaning loos now!</i>

1094
01:19:58,122 --> 01:20:03,018
Oh, so I'd be a whore! Love!
You heard what your sister says?

1095
01:20:03,019 --> 01:20:07,277
Huh? She said I'm a whore! And you?
Christ, you don't reply, you don't react?

1096
01:20:07,278 --> 01:20:11,341
How should he react? Don't you see what you turned him into?
- Calm, Lina.

1097
01:20:11,342 --> 01:20:13,640
At this point, let's tell it all.

1098
01:20:13,825 --> 01:20:17,079
That our brother married a whore,
no doubt about it.

1099
01:20:17,515 --> 01:20:22,430
But, shall we also tell that then someone
took advantage and poked his biscuit?

1100
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:27,363
I don't get it.
- Oh, you don't? Michele, you tell her!

1101
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:30,276
I'm good and quiet, however...
- They're gone!

1102
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:35,158
Michele! Huh?
To what biscuit my sister is refering?

1103
01:20:35,856 --> 01:20:37,972
- I don't grasp!
- Neither do I!

1104
01:20:38,082 --> 01:20:40,915
Look, Michele, you can't deny.
We've got proof!

1105
01:20:40,924 --> 01:20:42,460
You had me followed!

1106
01:20:42,892 --> 01:20:45,611
Filippo, show him! Come on.

1107
01:21:09,015 --> 01:21:10,960
<i>Here it is. Paste restanta.</i>

1108
01:21:11,112 --> 01:21:14,491
<i>I hope you won't deny the evidence?
Everything concurs:</i>

1109
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:17,711
The watch... the necklace...

1110
01:21:18,539 --> 01:21:21,030
Even your birthmark on the arm, Michele!

1111
01:21:21,258 --> 01:21:25,194
If we want to also check the mole
you have on the left buttock...

1112
01:21:25,306 --> 01:21:26,830
at your discretion.

1113
01:21:38,351 --> 01:21:40,945
You bitch!

1114
01:21:41,882 --> 01:21:45,568
You've destroyed the peace of my home!
- Calm down, Lina!

1115
01:21:54,642 --> 01:21:57,429
Show me too!
- It's not stuff for you, go!

1116
01:22:05,867 --> 01:22:08,131
<i>Lina! Alfredo!</i>

1117
01:22:09,182 --> 01:22:10,570
<i>Where are you?</i>

1118
01:22:11,313 --> 01:22:12,803
<i>Look who's here!</i>

1119
01:22:16,911 --> 01:22:18,924
What are you all doing here?

1120
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:21,287
Look who came to say hello.

1121
01:22:21,357 --> 01:22:23,837
Aunt Clementina!
- Aunt Clementina!

1122
01:22:28,969 --> 01:22:32,757
Oh God, how nice to see
you all gathered here!

1123
01:22:55,548 --> 01:22:56,663
What is it?

1124
01:22:57,181 --> 01:22:58,307
May I?

1125
01:22:59,643 --> 01:23:01,588
Look, I've thought about it.

1126
01:23:01,612 --> 01:23:04,524
It's pointless to get upset
with each other...

1127
01:23:10,097 --> 01:23:11,428
Come, come come!

1128
01:23:11,832 --> 01:23:14,812
Come! - What's up?
- You did well in coming.

1129
01:23:14,953 --> 01:23:17,660
I was saying that the situation is serious.

1130
01:23:17,891 --> 01:23:20,712
It's no use to be at each other's throats,
it leads nowhere.

1131
01:23:20,716 --> 01:23:22,013
That's what I say.

1132
01:23:22,052 --> 01:23:23,849
Look, go call Alessandro.

1133
01:23:24,099 --> 01:23:26,420
We'll talk about it, calmly.

1134
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:28,704
Alone!

1135
01:23:29,701 --> 01:23:32,670
If you want to talk in private...
- No... I'll go out.

1136
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:35,996
Where are you going?
Here the solution must be shared!

1137
01:23:44,782 --> 01:23:46,135
I meant to say...

1138
01:23:46,172 --> 01:23:49,696
There are rest homes of various kind.
They're not all alike.

1139
01:23:49,697 --> 01:23:52,211
Let's start by not calling them like that.

1140
01:23:52,222 --> 01:23:55,692
Rest homes, eh! Hotel!

1141
01:23:56,219 --> 01:24:01,083
<i>Hotel</i> homesl-There are some that drive
you crazy, beautiful, with bees, plants...

1142
01:24:01,084 --> 01:24:04,081
At worst, if there's to pay more,
we sell the house...

1143
01:24:04,082 --> 01:24:08,223
But you didn't understand mum!
What do we tell her? We don't want you?

1144
01:24:08,246 --> 01:24:11,613
And people? Haven't you thought
of what people would say?

1145
01:24:11,686 --> 01:24:13,916
Four children who resort to a rest home!

1146
01:24:13,930 --> 01:24:17,093
No, ifs a solution we can't consider,
come on.

1147
01:24:17,884 --> 01:24:20,114
<i>- Let us cast lots!
- Cast lots!?</i>

1148
01:24:20,498 --> 01:24:22,511
No, no, count me out, okay?

1149
01:24:23,108 --> 01:24:24,826
Should it fall to me?

1150
01:24:24,856 --> 01:24:28,997
Now that I've finally found my balance
with Mario? Heavens no, please!

1151
01:24:29,085 --> 01:24:32,202
Or else we can do the opposite:
We will come here.

1152
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:36,435
Four children... three months each.

1153
01:24:36,452 --> 01:24:39,569
Do you realize what you're saying?
And the job?

1154
01:24:39,695 --> 01:24:43,392
You think they'll move the control
tower here? Don't talk nonsense!

1155
01:24:46,293 --> 01:24:47,840
Let's go to the parish.

1156
01:24:47,871 --> 01:24:48,997
The parish?!

1157
01:24:49,054 --> 01:24:52,660
We'll seek a woman for companionship.
We ask Don Tanino.

1158
01:24:52,728 --> 01:24:57,530
A Filipino, an Albanian, a Pole...
You saw on TV? They're good people...

1159
01:24:57,531 --> 01:25:01,467
Sorry, then it doesn't get into your head.
Haven't you understood yet?

1160
01:25:02,426 --> 01:25:05,270
They want to be with us.
They want our love.

1161
01:25:05,593 --> 01:25:08,175
They don't want to die alone,
and abandoned.

1162
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:11,591
All useless chatter!
As if they'd live to the age of Noah!

1163
01:25:11,764 --> 01:25:14,663
How long you think they'll live,
those two poor things?

1164
01:25:14,664 --> 01:25:19,508
Did you see? Mum must be around 80, daddy
something less, but look at his state!

1165
01:25:19,509 --> 01:25:24,085
Forget it, the mean age has lengthened.
And usually who's always ill lives longer.

1166
01:25:24,086 --> 01:25:28,102
He who's always well, instead,
a heart attack, a stroke, and done.

1167
01:25:28,567 --> 01:25:32,082
And these are the luckiest cases.
But let's assume a paralysis:

1168
01:25:32,192 --> 01:25:36,743
they're immobilized the rest of life,
what do you do? You call Christ to help?

1169
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:49,426
Mauro!

1170
01:25:52,974 --> 01:25:54,987
I'll deal with you at home!

1171
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:56,932
What have I done, now?

1172
01:25:57,055 --> 01:26:00,934
Don't you see you're drenched?
Go finish your homework, rather!

1173
01:26:01,107 --> 01:26:05,200
But there's only left the essay on
Christmas holidays! They're not over yet!

1174
01:26:05,201 --> 01:26:07,249
Sure, always on the last day!

1175
01:26:07,589 --> 01:26:10,001
Look, in the snow! Imagine the germs!

1176
01:26:10,495 --> 01:26:11,553
Phew!

1177
01:26:12,966 --> 01:26:17,050
So, who cares if the one out there
gets sick? There's the dumbo here!

1178
01:26:18,262 --> 01:26:19,786
And then, buddy...

1179
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:23,096
it's in their genes.
They've a constitution...

1180
01:26:23,098 --> 01:26:24,372
You're telling me?

1181
01:26:24,407 --> 01:26:28,237
Yesterday I strolled at the cemetery
for the fun of watching the tombstones.

1182
01:26:28,238 --> 01:26:30,183
I even jotted it down, look.

1183
01:26:31,376 --> 01:26:34,691
The youngest is this:
Grandpa Tanino, died at 85 years.

1184
01:26:34,692 --> 01:26:37,650
Under bombardment. - Even!
- Otherwise...

1185
01:26:37,905 --> 01:26:39,497
Hey, you!

1186
01:26:39,645 --> 01:26:43,991
When your mother says something,
you must execute it at once! And silence!

1187
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:48,404
And then, <i>mommy</i> and daddy,
by hook or by crook,

1188
01:26:48,405 --> 01:26:52,000
have even been through two
world wars. They're toughened!

1189
01:26:53,599 --> 01:26:56,102
I feel it's as if I did a coercion.

1190
01:26:56,624 --> 01:27:01,300
What's that? Keep calm.
- No, but... Try to enjoy your aperitif!

1191
01:27:02,308 --> 01:27:04,094
Here comes the czarina.

1192
01:27:09,435 --> 01:27:12,859
Phew! Among these shops,
you only get bored!

1193
01:27:17,009 --> 01:27:21,628
My darling, what will you have?
- A dry Martini, thank you, love. - And you?

1194
01:27:21,739 --> 01:27:23,604
A chocolate zuocotto.

1195
01:27:23,626 --> 01:27:26,626
What? A chocolate zuccotto!

1196
01:27:26,627 --> 01:27:30,631
See if they have a nice low-fat yogurt,
it'll serve also as lunch!

1197
01:27:32,395 --> 01:27:34,636
<i>Happy New Year from Wdeoesse</i>

1198
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:39,403
<i>For New Year's Eve, we're awaiting you
at the Restaurant Palomba,</i>

1199
01:27:39,404 --> 01:27:42,009
<i>where you eat, you drink,
and you dance!</i>

1200
01:27:42,015 --> 01:27:46,156
<i>With a show by: Rudy de Cesaris!</i>

1201
01:27:47,487 --> 01:27:52,470
But... us, for New Year's Eve,
we don't organize anything?

1202
01:27:53,359 --> 01:27:56,468
With the troubles we have,
we worry about dancing?

1203
01:27:56,469 --> 01:27:58,903
I was saying so, just to say.

1204
01:28:00,219 --> 01:28:04,772
<i>Unfortunately, the news of serenity
is Uoubled by another news,</i>

1205
01:28:04,773 --> 01:28:08,889
<i>of a dead person and three wounded
as a result of the explosion that,</i>

1206
01:28:08,890 --> 01:28:12,907
<i>last night, has destroyed an
apartment on the outskirts of Milan.</i>

1207
01:28:12,908 --> 01:28:16,705
<i>At the origin of the disaster,
the leakage of gas from a cylinder</i>

1208
01:28:16,706 --> 01:28:18,799
<i>inside an old stove.</i>

1209
01:28:19,168 --> 01:28:22,509
<i>This brings to 185,
from the beginning of the year,</i>

1210
01:28:22,510 --> 01:28:25,547
<i>the victims of accidents
caused by gas leaks.</i>

1211
01:28:26,871 --> 01:28:29,374
<i>In this regard, for greater safety,</i>

1212
01:28:29,381 --> 01:28:34,227
<i>we invite you to periodically check the
condition and efficiency of the equipments,</i>

1213
01:28:34,330 --> 01:28:38,303
<i>in a particular way those fueled
with liquid gas cylinders.</i>

1214
01:28:38,304 --> 01:28:40,966
<i>The calls for prudence are never too many.</i>

1215
01:28:42,001 --> 01:28:43,275
"What is this?"

1216
01:28:44,670 --> 01:28:47,582
What? - What is this?
- Now I give you a slap!

1217
01:28:49,405 --> 01:28:51,259
<i>A 800..</i>

1218
01:28:52,325 --> 01:28:54,247
<i>Boo.-. boo.-.</i>

1219
01:28:55,098 --> 01:28:59,239
Boo. . Boo. . Peekaboo!
- But what "peekaboo", grandpa!

1220
01:28:59,396 --> 01:29:02,536
'This is book". Book. "Ubro".

1221
01:29:02,994 --> 01:29:04,962
<i>Oh, but this is English!</i>

1222
01:29:17,511 --> 01:29:19,047
Mama!

1223
01:29:19,417 --> 01:29:20,520
What's Up?

1224
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:25,115
Oh God!
What have you done? Another present?

1225
01:29:25,116 --> 01:29:29,109
So finally you can trash that brazier.
- It'd be about time, right?

1226
01:29:29,388 --> 01:29:30,980
One was for Christmas,

1227
01:29:31,012 --> 01:29:33,697
and this is for New Year.
- But you shouldn't!

1228
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:37,344
It's just a space heater!
We have contributed a bit each one.

1229
01:29:37,345 --> 01:29:40,610
Yes. . A bit each one.
- This, you put it in your room.

1230
01:29:40,689 --> 01:29:42,702
It is simple and functional.

1231
01:29:43,154 --> 01:29:45,907
What a nice thought!
- So you like it...

1232
01:29:46,065 --> 01:29:48,886
Watch how easily it moves. Right, Alfredo?

1233
01:29:49,723 --> 01:29:53,944
We wrapped it, Alfredo and I, we've put this nice bow...
- Michele,

1234
01:29:54,172 --> 01:29:59,311
what can I say? I thank you, I thank you with all my heart!
- Monica...

1235
01:29:59,312 --> 01:30:02,476
did you see the nice present
we gave to the grandparents?

1236
01:30:02,477 --> 01:30:05,845
<i>Moreover, a heater was needed.
- When you put it in your room</i>

1237
01:30:05,846 --> 01:30:08,955
<i>and you turn it on,
it stays warm as long as you want.</i>

1238
01:30:08,956 --> 01:30:13,529
<i>It's not like the brazier, that stinks
and burns out the oxygen, right?</i>

1239
01:30:46,567 --> 01:30:49,475
<i>And so, through the intercession
of a friend of dad,</i>

1240
01:30:49,476 --> 01:30:52,115
<i>we too managed to find
a place at the Palomba,</i>

1241
01:30:52,128 --> 01:30:56,736
<i>where mum and the aunts said there
were all the foremost families in town:</i>

1242
01:30:56,962 --> 01:30:59,897
<i>The Cipolloni, Moroni, Maranga...</i>

1243
01:31:00,090 --> 01:31:04,572
<i>Barbafl} Pozo/inl} Content}
Mazaccani and Co/adoppa.</i>

1244
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:31,449
Lina, try the lentils, they're very good.

1245
01:31:31,459 --> 01:31:34,064
I would, but with colitis, the lentils...

1246
01:31:34,078 --> 01:31:37,047
Who eats lentils on New Year,
makes money all year long.

1247
01:31:37,048 --> 01:31:40,199
It's the tradition,
you have to eat at least a little.

1248
01:32:55,882 --> 01:32:59,085
Excuse me, but the one
who's dancing with Monica,

1249
01:32:59,086 --> 01:33:01,953
isn't the son of Mazzoccone
of the egg pasta?

1250
01:33:02,032 --> 01:33:05,308
It would seem just so.
- Well placed people, huh?

1251
01:33:31,341 --> 01:33:34,868
Come on, get up!
Let's throw ourselves into the fray.

1252
01:34:33,086 --> 01:34:34,269
The lights!

1253
01:34:37,163 --> 01:34:40,922
Midnight is impending!
Have you filled your goblets?

1254
01:34:40,923 --> 01:34:42,595
<i>Yes!</i>

1255
01:34:42,631 --> 01:34:45,327
Have you filled them with champagne?

1256
01:34:45,338 --> 01:34:46,805
<i>Yes!</i>

1257
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:48,342
Drum roll!

1258
01:34:49,153 --> 01:34:53,658
Minus ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

1259
01:34:53,813 --> 01:34:59,206
five, four, three, two, one, zero!

1260
01:35:01,187 --> 01:35:02,768
Happy New Year!

1261
01:35:50,387 --> 01:35:54,729
<i>My holidays have begun well,
however they ended badly,</i>

1262
01:35:54,730 --> 01:35:57,210
<i>because both my grandparents died.!</i>

1263
01:35:57,537 --> 01:35:59,402
Really? I'm sorry.

1264
01:35:59,429 --> 01:36:01,795
They died from an explosion of gas,

1265
01:36:01,806 --> 01:36:07,130
and it was very important, because it came
on newspapers and it was also shown on TV.

1266
01:36:07,766 --> 01:36:11,196
However I don't understand why
mum, dad and the uncles

1267
01:36:11,197 --> 01:36:15,725
said that the fault was of the stove,
which was too old.

1268
01:36:15,884 --> 01:36:19,215
Instead the stove was new,
because they gave it to them

1269
01:36:19,216 --> 01:36:22,288
that very day,
for the New Year holiday.
