1
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,600
Mr. Gustafson!

2
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,700
I have to talk to you!

3
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,200
Mr. Gustafson, will you answer
the door, please?!

4
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,800
I know you're in there!

5
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,700
<i>It's</i> no use pretending this <i>isn't</i>
happening, Mr. Gustafson!

6
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,800
I <i>can't</i> keep coming...

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,900
...back here every couple of days!

8
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,600
You have to talk to me!

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,900
Mr. Gustafson, <i>I'm</i> just trying
to help you!

10
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,200
Come on and open the door!

11
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,400
I'll just keep knocking!

12
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,600
I'll come back, so you might
as well answer the door!

13
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,400
I know you're in there!

14
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,800
Think of the neighbors,
Mr. Gustafson!

15
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,300
<i>There's</i> a letter for you,
Mr. Gustafson!

16
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,300
I suggest you read it!

17
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,400
- Morning, dickhead.
- Hello, moron.

18
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,100
What are you?

19
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,700
Never mind. Just forget it.

20
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,300
<i>Who's</i> the guy yakking?

21
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,900
Mind your own business.

22
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,900
Mind your own business. Tie your shoe.
You'll fall on your stupid head.

23
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,400
Shut up!

24
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,000
We're having a heat wave.

25
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,600
<i>''W e're having a heat wave
A tropical heat <i>wave''</i>

26
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,200
Somebody moving into
the old Clickner place.

27
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,200
- You picked up on that, Sherlock.
- Excuse me!

28
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,500
I wonder if you could tell me...

29
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,200
...where I could find Mr. Gustafson?

30
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,200
Gustafson? Sorry.

31
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,100
- Mr. John Gustafson?
- <i>That's</i> right.

32
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,800
You mean the low-life, ass-wipe,
egg-sucker John Gustafson?

33
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,700
Have you seen him?

34
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,200
That <i>man's</i> crazy. Loco.

35
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,700
Always hanging around
those kinky strip bars...

36
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,600
...where men take their clothes off.

37
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,900
If <i>he's</i> taken his medication.

38
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,600
Medication?

39
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,900
Without it, he could be anywhere.
Wandering around talking to trees.

40
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,700
Believe me, <i>he's</i> a menace.
Always drinking, fighting. Am I right?

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,300
But have you seen him?

42
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,300
Sorry.

43
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,700
I think, perhaps...

44
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,700
If you see him...

45
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,400
...give him this and
tell him to contact...

46
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
...Mr. Snyder immediately.

47
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,400
Schneider?

48
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,700
Snyder.

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
<i>That's</i> me.

50
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,500
<i>It's</i> important.

51
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,000
Important? We'll tell him...

52
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,800
...when we see him.

53
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,400
Watch out for that ice.

54
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,800
Very slippery.

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,100
Right.

56
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,600
Holy moly!

57
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,000
Jesus!

58
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,000
A <i>men's</i> strip joint?

59
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,800
Idiot.

60
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,500
Thirty days.

61
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,300
This is great.

62
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,700
You should have seen Mrs. <i>Carlson's</i>
face when he said ''lt's a <i>keeper.''</i>

63
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,300
Oh, cold enough for you?

64
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,800
Shut up, fat-ass!

65
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,100
<i>It's</i> not yet Thanksgiving and we're
enjoying our lovely fall weather.

66
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,500
Six inches of snow...

67
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,900
...with <i>travelers'</i> advisories
in our area tonight.

68
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,900
<i>You'd</i> be advised to stay inside
and have yourself a warm...

69
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,000
...home-cooked meal.

70
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,200
<i>Here's what's</i> coming up this week.

71
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,200
<i>It's</i> snow, snow, and more snow.

72
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,600
We've got snow coming into
our area all week long.

73
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,000
Sunday afternoon, another cold front...

74
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,600
...will move into our area,
and you know what that means.

75
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,600
What the hell?!

76
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,800
Holy... moly!

77
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,400
Oh, my God!

78
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,900
You're still using that beat-up
piece of firewood?

79
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,800
The Green <i>Hornet's</i> caught more fish
than you've lied about, Gustafson.

80
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,400
You see her?

81
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,200
Drives pretty fast on that snowmobile.

82
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,600
Pretty damn fast.

83
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Did you hear about Eddie Hicks?

84
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,700
<i>Hypothermia's</i> a bitch.

85
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
Not quick like a stroke.

86
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
A stroke is no good.
You could end up like a vegetable.

87
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,400
Give me a cardiac any day.

88
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,200
You know what Jacob said?

89
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,700
Jacob said that Billy Hinshel
was killed in a car crash.

90
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,200
Head-on collision with a truck.

91
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,100
Cleared his car straight over the bridge
into the Mississippi.

92
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,600
Lucky bastard.

93
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,300
You bet.

94
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,500
How is he anyway?

95
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
<i>He's</i> dead!

96
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,200
Died on impact!

97
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,400
Jacob...

98
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,700
...moron. Jacob!

99
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,700
Oh, <i>he's</i> fine.

100
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,900
Doing real good. Busy.

101
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,000
He promised to come for Thanksgiving.

102
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,600
Is he really running for mayor?

103
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Make a damn fine mayor, too.

104
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,600
<i>It's</i> good he looks like his mother
or <i>he'd</i> never get on the ballot.

105
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,800
Eat my shorts.

106
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,600
Hello, Mrs. Truax.

107
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,100
Holy moly!

108
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,900
Jesus Quincy Adams.

109
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,200
I hit the cans again.

110
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,800
I heard.

111
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,600
How is the Grinch today?

112
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,500
<i>Ain't</i> got a pot to piss in
or a window to throw it out of.

113
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,800
Can I get you something?

114
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,300
A six-pack of Schmidt and some bait.

115
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,600
Shiners or wax worms?

116
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,200
I <i>can't</i> afford shiners, get me worms.

117
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,800
The worms are 75 cents.

118
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
75 cents? Crime-in-Italy!

119
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,600
Chuck, we're talking about
worms not caviar.

120
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,200
You go through that every time.

121
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,000
Where are you going to get worms this
time of year? <i>It's</i> supply and demand.

122
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,100
You could retire from selling me worms.
Throw the beef jerky in too.

123
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,800
Five dollars for the beer
and the worms.

124
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,400
Your old gut <i>can't</i> handle jerky.

125
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,300
Goddamn!

126
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,800
Is Pop out there at the shanty?

127
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,700
Always.

128
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,500
And the moron?

129
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,900
Lots of ice out there, Gustafson.

130
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,200
Should be room enough for both of you.

131
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,000
Lots of ice out there, Gustafson.

132
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,900
Hi, Dad!

133
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Any luck today?

134
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,900
How the hell should I know?
I just got here.

135
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,800
Mel, she came by the other day and...

136
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,100
...said <i>you'd</i> been snapping.

137
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,800
Like a catfish.

138
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,300
I've had a lot on my mind lately.

139
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,000
I'll tell you <i>what's</i> on my mind.

140
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,400
<i>It's</i> butt-cold out here
and <i>I'm</i> fresh out of beer.

141
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,800
Someone moved into the Clickner place.
A woman.

142
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,200
A woman?

143
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,400
Did you mount her?

144
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
Oh, Dad!

145
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,200
Does she have big thighs?

146
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,700
Then <i>what's</i> the problem?

147
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,900
If I was a young fellow like you,
<i>I'd</i> be mounting...

148
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,900
...every woman in Wabasha.

149
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,500
Keep the change.

150
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,500
Hi, Punky.

151
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,000
Hi, John!

152
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,200
The Green Hornet strikes again!

153
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,900
Caught my limit!

154
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,800
You only snagged one.

155
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,200
Two fish are on there, you bonehead.

156
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,000
I throw back what <i>I'm</i> not going to eat.

157
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,800
Yeah, like that 40-pound muskie
you're always yakking about.

158
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,600
<i>It's</i> a shame nobody ever sees you
with these monsters.

159
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,600
You'll love it, Goldman.

160
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,200
Go to work.

161
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,900
What is it?

162
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,200
Oh, my God, they've come for me.

163
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,200
Oh, my God! I...

164
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,800
You see, I was...

165
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,000
Excuse me, but I saw your light on
and I was wondering...

166
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,600
...if I might use your bathroom.

167
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,800
What?

168
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,200
Your toilet is broken?

169
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,700
No, thank goodness.

170
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,300
I <i>don't</i> know, the house seemed so empty
tonight. I do so love bathrooms.

171
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,500
You can tell a lot about a person
from his bathroom.

172
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,100
I <i>didn't</i> know that.

173
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,800
There it is. I <i>can't</i> wait
to see <i>what's</i> in there.

174
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,400
- Wait a minute.
- Much better than palm-reading.

175
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,500
Give me 30 seconds
in a <i>person's</i> bathroom...

176
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,800
...and I'll give you a complete
and accurate profile.

177
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,800
<i>There's</i> a guest bathroom.

178
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,300
Only be a minute.

179
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
So?

180
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,600
Fascinating.

181
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,600
<i>Shouldn't</i> you introduce yourself?

182
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,200
John Gustafson, right?

183
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,200
I took some of your mail yesterday
to find out who you were.

184
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,600
But you <i>don't</i> get much and...

185
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,500
...it <i>doesn't</i> paint a picture.

186
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,400
Taking mail is a federal offense.

187
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,800
I know.

188
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,700
Sometimes you must go a long distance
out of the way in order to...

189
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,600
...return a short distance correctly.

190
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,700
<i>Don't</i> you find that?

191
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,400
I love that line.

192
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,600
<i>It's</i> not mine. <i>It's</i> from
<i>''T he Zoo Story''</i> by Edward Albee.

193
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,000
I teach American literature at
Winona State University.

194
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,300
I started yesterday.

195
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,700
Oh, I love the classics, <i>don't</i> you?

196
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,200
Well, I also read ''Field and <i>Stream.''</i>

197
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Indeed?

198
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,300
You have a whole library
up there from what I saw.

199
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,200
<i>There's</i> something really rugged
and virile about the outdoors.

200
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,200
My manners! <i>I'm</i> sorry.

201
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,800
<i>I'm</i> Ariel Truax.

202
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,300
How do you do? <i>I'm</i> John Gustafson.

203
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,000
Yes, I know.

204
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,300
When did you move into the Clickner's?

205
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,200
<i>I'm</i> sure you know that.

206
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,700
Since I got here you and Max Goldman...

207
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,600
...have been against the windows
watching me like two Garfield cats.

208
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,300
Like people stick to their car windows.

209
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,000
The little suction cups they have...

210
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,400
Squirrels.

211
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,400
Been watching squirrels. <i>One's</i> been
making a nest under your eaves.

212
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,800
Sure, John.

213
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,200
<i>Here's</i> your mail.

214
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,000
<i>There's</i> nothing addressed
to a Mrs. Gustafson.

215
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,900
By the state of your bathroom
I presume you're a bachelor.

216
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,400
Gay or straight?

217
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,800
Heterosexual or homosexual?

218
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,500
Jeez Louise...

219
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,400
<i>It's</i> a legitimate question.

220
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Maybe in California
but not here in Minnesota.

221
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,400
Have I upset you?

222
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,200
<i>It's</i> the middle of the night
and I <i>don't</i> know what...

223
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,100
Do you want me to leave?

224
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,000
No... yes.

225
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,400
It was very nice meeting you,
John Gustafson.

226
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,500
And now that we know each other,
<i>don't</i> be a stranger.

227
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,000
Oh, and John...

228
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,700
<i>...king's</i> rook to <i>queen's</i> bishop three.

229
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,400
<i>Don't</i> ring that up yet.

230
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,400
I need something for my lumbago.
<i>It's</i> killing me.

231
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,600
<i>It's</i> killing you my ass. He <i>wouldn't</i>
know the meaning of the word ''pain.''

232
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,600
I got a pinched sciatica make
your lumbago look like eyestrain.

233
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,300
Pain. He wants to talk about pain.

234
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,800
I had a gallstone big as a baseball.

235
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,000
Gallstones are for pussies.

236
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,200
When I had shingles did you see me
complain to Phil?

237
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,600
- Did you?
- Shingles schmingles.

238
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,100
When I had my ulcers...

239
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,500
...I was...

240
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,300
...farting razor blades.

241
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,500
Oh, you must be Max Goldman.

242
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,000
<i>I'm</i> your new neighbor.

243
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,400
Pleasure.

244
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,800
<i>Isn't</i> it a peach of a day?

245
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,200
<i>Here's</i> something for you.

246
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,600
It was left at my house by accident.

247
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,600
Some of your mail.

248
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,600
Sorry.

249
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,000
Have my herbal therapy oils arrived yet?

250
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,400
This morning.

251
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,200
Special delivery from...

252
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,600
...California.

253
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,400
Wonderful!

254
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,700
Ah, yes, <i>there's</i> nothing
like the scent of...

255
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,700
...fresh tea tree...

256
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,500
...just soaking into your pores.

257
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,200
<i>Don't</i> you agree?

258
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,600
Uh, lovely.

259
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,500
It was a pleasure meeting you
and <i>I'm</i> sure we'II...

260
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,900
...be seeing a lot of one another.
Good-bye, gentlemen.

261
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,700
Holy moly!

262
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,100
Now wait. You got all
four wheels on the track?

263
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,200
All right. Careful, fellas.

264
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,900
Be careful. <i>That's</i> over 100 years old.

265
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,300
Thing might collapse.

266
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,300
Hi, sweetheart.

267
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,700
How are you?

268
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,000
- <i>Granddaddy's</i> little girl.
- <i>What's</i> going on?

269
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,800
<i>I'm</i> getting rid of that.
<i>It's</i> just firewood.

270
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,700
Why?

271
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,200
I <i>don't</i> know. I <i>don't</i> play it much.
It sits around collecting dust.

272
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,500
You love that piano.

273
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,800
<i>Granddaddy's</i> got a surprise
for you in the house, pumpkin.

274
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,500
A little C-A-N-D-Y. It <i>won't</i> kill her.

275
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,100
Which one?

276
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,300
Which hand? This one?

277
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,700
<i>That's</i> the one.

278
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,600
There you are, sweetpea.

279
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,400
- How 'bout that? Here.
- Dad.

280
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,700
Is something wrong?

281
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,200
No, no. <i>Nothing's</i> wrong at all.

282
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,200
With me, uh...

283
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,500
How do I?

284
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,000
- People are asking about you.
- I know.

285
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,000
Yeah, I keep telling them
that you and Mike are...

286
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,500
...doing just fine.
<i>It's</i> just a lot of gum-flapping.

287
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,400
Mike and I <i>aren't</i> fine.

288
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,600
<i>That's</i> what I thought.

289
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,700
We're separating for a while.

290
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,800
Honey, marriage <i>isn't</i> easy.
You have to work at it.

291
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,900
<i>It's</i> hard to work at it
when <i>he's</i> never there.

292
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,800
Sounds familiar. Mother wondered
where I was for 20 years.

293
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,900
You really think I wanted two jobs?
I <i>didn't</i> do that for me. I was...

294
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,900
...doing it for you, Brian and Mother.

295
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,000
Dad, this <i>isn't</i> about you.
<i>It's</i> about me and Mike.

296
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,200
<i>I'm</i> sorry. I keep...

297
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,100
<i>I'm</i> sorry. I love you so much.

298
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,300
Well, whatever you
and Mike decide is...

299
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,400
I never liked him anyway.

300
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,300
Who is that?

301
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,200
I <i>don't</i> know.

302
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,000
She seems to know you.

303
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,400
Well...

304
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,400
Does she always do that?

305
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
I <i>don't</i> know.

306
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,200
This is great!

307
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,600
We hope you enjoyed
our feature presentation.

308
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,000
Now stay tuned for <i>tonight's</i>
$6.4 million...

309
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,600
...jackpot on Powerball.

310
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,100
Followed by local news.

311
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,400
Out of the way.

312
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,900
Come on, baby.
I've got to win a million bucks.

313
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,700
Jacob, you got my vote! <i>That's</i> great.

314
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,500
Come on in. Have a little TV dinner.
<i>Lasagna's</i> heating up now.

315
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,200
No time. I had to give you this
for the yard.

316
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,600
I have to deliver a lot.

317
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,000
Just have one drink.

318
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,200
I can't. Sorry. I'll call you.

319
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
No, close the door. Come in.

320
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,600
Wait a minute. Give me a minute.

321
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,600
$6.4 million is our estimated jackpot.

322
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,200
You could be a millionaire.

323
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,300
To win the jackpot, correctly match
five white balls and the red powerball.

324
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,400
Our first number is a...

325
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,400
<i>What's</i> going on?

326
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,000
Number four. Remember, to win
the jackpot, match five white balls...

327
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,600
...and the red powerball.

328
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,000
Come on!

329
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,300
Schmuck <i>doesn't</i> know anything.

330
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
A... 25...

331
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,000
<i>There's</i> just one more white ball
and here it is...

332
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,300
Jesus Christ!

333
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,600
Goldman. <i>It's</i> Goldman.

334
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,600
You're a child.

335
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
<i>Don't</i> tell me. It <i>isn't</i> me.

336
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,700
Oh, it never is.

337
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,000
John started every fight since 1940.

338
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,100
<i>'Thirty-Eight.

339
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,200
<i>It's</i> ridiculous.

340
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,800
Come here and apologize.

341
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,800
- Come here!
- <i>I'm</i> not apologizing to anybody!

342
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,700
You're letting the cold air in.

343
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,200
Take that, you criminal.

344
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,400
I <i>don't</i> believe it.

345
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,600
That old trick?

346
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,400
This is between me and your father.
<i>There's</i> no need for you to get involved.

347
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,200
I <i>don't</i> say anything on one condition.

348
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,200
Put one of these in your yard.

349
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,700
<i>I'd</i> be proud to.

350
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,700
Hey, not one word
to your old man, remember?

351
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,500
Have fun, Johnny.

352
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Hey, dickhead, you win the Lottery?

353
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,700
Enjoy your shower, smart ass?

354
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,200
Got to use hot water, you schmuck.

355
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,000
You'll never get me.

356
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,600
See you later.

357
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
Up yours, Gustafson!

358
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,400
What the hell is that smell?

359
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,400
Watch it, bonehead.

360
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,000
Mrs. Cusack said she came in here
yesterday to buy some...

361
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,800
...candles and incense.

362
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,600
<i>She's</i> probably a member
of one of them religious cults.

363
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,200
You say <i>she's</i> all alone?

364
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,400
What I heard. <i>She's</i> available...

365
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,800
...and hot to trot.

366
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,400
Moron.

367
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,500
Putz.

368
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,100
We were talking about
your new neighbor.

369
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:04,800
What?

370
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,800
My new neighbor? Oh, yes, new neighbor.
She came over to see me last night.

371
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,700
What?

372
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,200
About 1:30 in the morning.

373
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,000
Why would a woman come over
at 1:30 to see you?

374
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,100
Why do you think?
I'll have a six-pack.

375
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,600
Women...

376
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,900
...and fish, you <i>can't</i> catch
either one of them, Gustafson.

377
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,000
I've laid more pipe in this town
than Wabasha Plumbing.

378
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,600
You're going to go after her?

379
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,000
Oh, jeez. God no. <i>She's</i> too...
<i>she's</i> too disturbed for me.

380
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,300
- For you, maybe.
- I <i>won't</i> have anything to do with her.

381
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,800
Women fall too hard for me.

382
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
They get obsessed with me.

383
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,900
<i>It's</i> like one of them
<i>''Fatal Attraction''</i> things...

384
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,900
...that they show on
the Donahue Show, you know.

385
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,200
You guys are the biggest
bullshitters in this...

386
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,000
...entire frozen nation!

387
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,700
You're just plain chicken.

388
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,600
Both of you.

389
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,900
A beautiful woman just sitting there...

390
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,100
...20 feet from your front yards,
and you're trying...

391
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,600
...to tell me <i>you'd</i> rather park...

392
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,100
...your wrinkly butts...

393
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,000
...on a frozen piece of ice, kissing up
to buckets of fish bait! Ha!

394
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,600
Gee, listen to Casanova.

395
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,200
Yeah, <i>he's</i> a regular Don Juan.

396
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,500
No wonder women ''don <i>juan''</i>
anything to do with you.

397
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,500
- <i>That's</i> it.
- That did it. 'Bye.

398
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,500
<i>I'm</i> out. I am out.

399
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,900
Hey, Max, say hello to Jake for me.

400
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,700
Why <i>don't</i> you come over
and have some turkey with us?

401
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,500
<i>There's</i> always plenty of bird
with just Jacob and me.

402
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,100
You can spend next week
in bed with ptomaine.

403
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,800
Come over to my place,
Melanie cooks up a feast.

404
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,700
Thanks.

405
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,300
But you know those old boys at the
V.F.W. Expect me every Thanksgiving.

406
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,800
Forget it. 'Bye, Chuck.

407
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,900
Moron.

408
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,200
Putz.

409
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,000
Tell me something.

410
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,300
Do I stink?

411
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,300
Not you, smart ass.

412
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,600
<i>Didn't</i> ask you!

413
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,600
I could smell it in the car.

414
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,200
This stink!

415
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
Is it me?

416
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,700
Damn!

417
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,200
What the hell is that?

418
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,700
For <i>Christ's</i> sake.

419
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,100
Gustafson.

420
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,900
You schmuck!

421
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,800
Disgrace the way they coach that team.

422
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,100
Stay there.

423
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,100
Stay there, you bastard.

424
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,300
- How are you, Punky?
- Hey, buttercup.

425
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,600
Give me two packs of Camels and a cup
of your special coffee, love-muffin.

426
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,000
You should smoke filter cigarettes.

427
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,600
Yeah, well, <i>I'm</i> 94 years old.

428
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,900
What the hell do I care?

429
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,000
Thank you, dear.

430
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,500
Max is here.

431
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
Come on, love-muffin.

432
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,700
Thanks.

433
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,200
You're always there to save me.

434
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,300
Yeah, right.

435
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,800
When Billy Gerber locked me
in the tree house...

436
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,500
...you were my knight in shining armor.

437
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,800
And I got a black eye for my effort.

438
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
There you go.

439
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,500
I always knew, you know.

440
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,700
Knew what?

441
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,600
That you liked me since sixth grade.

442
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,400
You watched me with
your <i>dad's</i> binoculars.

443
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,800
What?

444
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,000
You never wondered why my curtains
were open just enough?

445
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,900
I thought I was lucky.

446
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,100
I just did it to torture you.

447
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,300
Well you succeeded wonderfully.

448
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,900
How come you never asked me out?

449
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,700
Hey, Mel! Hi, Jakie!

450
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,100
Mel, is the turkey supposed
to be smoking?

451
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,400
Oh, I better run.

452
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,200
Happy Thanksgiving!

453
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,800
How are you?

454
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,800
Good.

455
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,700
They're getting a divorce.

456
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,400
Mel and Mike are divorcing. They
call it a separation but <i>it's</i> a divorce.

457
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,500
<i>I'm</i> sorry to hear that.

458
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,200
So, are you seeing anyone special?

459
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,200
No, I guess not. Nobody serious.

460
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,500
What do you know?

461
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,400
We got a new neighbor, you hear?

462
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,900
Everyone in town is talking about her.

463
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,300
She <i>hasn't</i> been out since 11:20.

464
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,800
What, are you clocking her?

465
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,700
She keeps odd hours.

466
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,000
Very interesting woman.

467
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,400
Sounds like a wacko to me.

468
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,600
I <i>haven't</i> had sex for 15 years.

469
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,100
Could I have some?

470
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,300
That was plenty.

471
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,900
Give Jakie some leftovers to take home.

472
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,100
He'll have his own.

473
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,000
That pre-cooked stuff his old man gets?
That tastes like cardboard.

474
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,800
Why <i>don't</i> you go and talk to her?

475
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,400
Talk to who?

476
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,800
You spent half the meal
staring out the window.

477
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,900
Squirrels.

478
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,900
The squirrels on her roof.
<i>That's</i> what I was staring at.

479
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:09,800
You're a handsome guy with a nice house,
a good pension. You got a lot to offer.

480
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,100
Well, I got something to offer her.

481
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
I got zip to offer her.

482
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,300
I <i>can't</i> tell if this is done!

483
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,700
Do you know how many minutes
this needs to cook?

484
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,500
Getting hungry.

485
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,200
Sure be nice to have some turkey.

486
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,200
Remember the turkey
your mother used to make?

487
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,500
Damn, she was a good cook.

488
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,600
You remember the stuffing?

489
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,900
The best.

490
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,800
How about those potato latkes?

491
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,700
You said Chuck was at the V.F.W.

492
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,800
He is.

493
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,100
I <i>don't</i> think so.

494
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,500
What are you talking about?

495
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,800
Looks like <i>he's</i> making a house call.

496
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,200
What?

497
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,500
What the...

498
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,300
Hell is he doing there?

499
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,400
<i>He's</i> going to do it.

500
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,200
So?

501
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,300
What?

502
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,200
What is he doing in that crazy...

503
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,800
- Son of a...
- Jealous?

504
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,200
<i>He's</i> in.

505
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,200
<i>He's</i> in. <i>He's</i> in.

506
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,900
Looks like <i>Chuck's</i> taking old one-eye
to the optometrist.

507
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,900
Oh, Jeez, Dad. What?

508
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,000
Chuck, where are you?

509
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,300
Hello, fellas.

510
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,400
Some game last night! Double overtime.

511
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,900
- Blackhawks were killers, <i>weren't</i> they?
- Did you catch the game?

512
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Oh, sure. You were with
the guys at the V.F.W.

513
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,800
Yeah, how was the turkey at the V.F.W.
This year, Chuckie?

514
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,400
The turkey this year...

515
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
...was delicious.

516
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Come on!

517
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,400
We saw you!

518
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,500
<i>What'd</i> you do?

519
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,800
- <i>What's</i> it like in there?
- <i>What'd</i> she say?

520
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,600
Fellas!

521
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,400
Some experiences in life are too rich...

522
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,100
...and too beautiful to put into words.

523
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,000
What does that mean exactly?

524
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,900
Could have been either of you
if you just had the guts to ask.

525
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,400
- You and she?
- <i>I'm</i> not talking about sex, dummies.

526
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,000
Of course not.

527
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,000
Oh, I get it.

528
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,400
Your old pal failed you, Chuck?

529
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,100
<i>Couldn't</i> rise to the occasion?

530
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,600
Yes, the spirit was willing...

531
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,000
But the flesh was...

532
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,200
Weak.

533
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,400
If it <i>wasn't</i> sex, what was it?

534
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,100
It was an awakening.

535
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,700
Ariel reminded me that I was alive.

536
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,100
That I was a man full of energy,
love and passion.

537
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,800
It was like being young again.

538
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,100
If only for a moment.

539
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,200
<i>Couldn't</i> get it up, huh?

540
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,400
Get out of here, both of you.

541
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,200
Yeah, I'll see you.

542
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,900
So long.

543
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,400
Hey, boys.

544
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,200
<i>That's</i> not just a woman
living across your street.

545
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,600
<i>She's</i> an angel.

546
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,500
Angel, right.

547
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,900
Take it easy.

548
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,800
See you.

549
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,100
Holy moly!

550
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,200
Look at all the crap you...

551
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,200
Excuse me. The stuff you got here.

552
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,800
Well, <i>it's</i> my inspiration.

553
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,800
You did?

554
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,200
You're an artist?

555
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,000
I try.

556
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,500
I used to teach courses
in Expressionism at Berkeley.

557
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,600
But now <i>I'm</i> back to
the classics of literature.

558
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,200
Berkeley, that explains it.

559
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,800
Oh, my God!

560
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,500
What?!

561
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Your TV. <i>It's</i> got no guts.

562
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,800
I took them out.

563
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,200
How could you do that
to a '54 Super Zenith?

564
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,400
This TV is a classic.

565
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,700
I could fix it for you
if you wanted me to.

566
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,700
<i>That's</i> what I used to do.
I was a TV repairman.

567
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,500
<i>That's</i> so sweet, Max, but...

568
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,200
...I think it works quite well...

569
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,000
...just the way it is.

570
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,400
How the hell does she see any shows?

571
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,600
Holy moly!

572
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,400
You met Ernest.

573
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,600
Who?

574
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,600
The model was my husband.

575
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,900
He sure <i>wasn't</i> pleased about
modeling in the nude.

576
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:49,000
Took quite a bit of prompting.
I must say.

577
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,400
He's?

578
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,400
Passed on.

579
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,000
Five years ago.

580
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,000
Would you like some coffee?

581
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,400
Cream and sugar?

582
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,900
You moved around a lot
the last few years.

583
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:22,500
Yes, I think <i>it's</i> exciting
to experience new things...

584
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,500
...new places, and meet new people.

585
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,800
Like you.

586
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,900
Do you paint?

587
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,400
Paint? Me?

588
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:35,600
Sure do.

589
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,000
I paint the shed every spring.

590
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,800
- You get it?
- I get it.

591
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,400
I mean, you know...

592
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,200
...pictures, paintings.

593
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,200
What for?

594
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,800
Everyone needs some form of...

595
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,900
...release.

596
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,700
I fish.

597
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,500
Fish?

598
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,600
Fish?

599
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,900
Oh. Yeah. Fish.
I can see the beauty in that.

600
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,200
You can?

601
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,600
Miss Truax...

602
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:16,400
...would you honor me by accompanying
me to my ice shanty tomorrow?

603
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,500
<i>I'd</i> be honored.

604
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,600
See you tomorrow.

605
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,900
Yeah, <i>I'm</i> looking forward to it.

606
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,200
Be careful!

607
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,600
<i>''W e're having a heat wave
A tropical heat wave

608
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,000
<i>''W e're having a heat wave''</i>

609
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,400
- I <i>can't</i> hold it!
- Reel him in!

610
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,000
- I <i>can't</i> hold him, Max.
- Work him!

611
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,600
- I am trying! I <i>can't</i> hold it!
- Reel it in!

612
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,300
- <i>I'm</i> trying but I can't!
- Okay, give me the pole.

613
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,900
Hold on! Not on your life!

614
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:08,000
Pull it! You got to pull it!
No, <i>don't</i> pull too hard! <i>That's</i> it.

615
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,600
Morning, John.

616
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,800
Morning, Punky.

617
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,900
I almost lost him.

618
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,600
Oh, Max, <i>he's</i> just magnificent.

619
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,000
<i>He's</i> a record breaker!
About three feet!

620
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:28,000
I can see the beauty in this now.

621
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,300
- Can you see it?
- Yes, the lure. No, the fight.

622
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,100
Wait till I show the guys.

623
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,300
The catch!

624
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,300
And then the release.

625
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,100
What? <i>There's</i> no release.

626
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,800
Ah, yes, <i>it's</i> beautiful.

627
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,200
No, <i>what's</i> beautiful is this monster
on my wall stuffed!

628
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,400
There can be no stuffing.

629
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,200
This is a live creature.

630
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,100
Full of courage and life.

631
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,300
Nobody'll believe me. I need a camera.

632
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,400
- I hear the water calling it back.
- Where is it?

633
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,500
- Here we go!
- Wait!

634
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,800
Calling!

635
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,400
Here! Hold it!

636
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,000
Hey! Just finishing breakfast.

637
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,900
So I see.

638
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,800
Colder than a <i>witch's</i> titty out there.

639
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,600
Where did you get this?

640
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,600
I snagged it about an hour ago.

641
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,800
The only damn thing I caught all day.

642
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,700
Chuck, guess what Pop found?!

643
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,500
Chuck, you forgot to unlock
the back door, you dummy.

644
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,400
<i>Isn't</i> it wonderful to have
a little adventure every day?

645
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,700
You're one hell of a fisherman, Ariel.

646
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,200
I learned from the best.

647
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,700
Hope you <i>didn't</i> mind putting them back.

648
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,600
<i>That's</i> okay.
Gustafson does the same thing.

649
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,400
He just keeps the ones he eats.
<i>That's</i> what he says.

650
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,800
I think he never catches them.

651
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,100
I think we're going to be great friends.

652
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,200
Oh, friends. Friends is good.

653
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,400
<i>That's</i> good, <i>isn't</i> it?

654
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,200
How about some supper tonight?
After your class, I mean.

655
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,600
Oh, thank you so much, but I already
have made plans. <i>I'm</i> sorry.

656
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,800
I'll take a rain check.

657
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:57,800
<i>That's</i> a deal.

658
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Until we meet again, my dear Ariel.

659
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,200
Good-bye.

660
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,900
Watch out! <i>Don't</i> slip!

661
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,300
Well, Gustafson, looks like
the best man won.

662
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,400
Yeah, you always were a lousy loser.

663
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,000
<i>He's</i> dead.

664
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,800
What? Who?

665
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,700
Chuck!

666
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,200
Chuck? How?

667
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,200
Last night in his sleep.

668
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,100
His sleep.

669
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,800
Lucky bastard.

670
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,100
You might have known if you <i>hadn't</i>
been out with that minx.

671
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,600
Hey, it <i>ain't</i> my fault.
Chuck was my friend too!

672
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,500
You call yourself a friend, bastard!

673
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,800
Watch your mouth, you dumb Swede.

674
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,400
<i>Don't</i> tell me what to do!

675
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,200
Big man with the axe in your hand.

676
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,100
Axe? You want to clock me?
You think you can take me?

677
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,000
Come on!

678
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,800
All right. 1937 at Todd Field...

679
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,600
...I kicked your ass after football
practice when you stole my liniment.

680
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,100
- I kicked your ass and I'll do it again!
- Bullshit!

681
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,200
Give it your best shot, shrimp.

682
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,200
<i>It's</i> not worth it.

683
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,300
Get out of there!

684
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,200
Damn!

685
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,300
He has the intelligence quotient
of a newt.

686
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,600
Shrimp thinks he can get funny with me.

687
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,200
Left hook...

688
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,500
...right cross...

689
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,200
...and dump him.

690
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,800
<i>I'm</i> going to kill him.

691
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Goddamn you, Goldman, you...

692
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,800
<i>I'm</i> Elliot Snyder of the I.R.S.

693
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,400
<i>I'm</i> asking you to come to my office.

694
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,600
I was wondering where you were.

695
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,400
I was... I had a little business.

696
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,300
I hope it went all right.

697
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,700
What are you doing?!

698
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,600
Cooking.

699
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,500
Wait, I <i>can't</i> have anything spicy.

700
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,000
If <i>it's</i> too exciting, <i>I'm</i> up all night.

701
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,600
Good.

702
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,800
<i>I'm</i> making Szechuan.

703
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:26,800
From the moment I saw you, I could feel
that we had the same kind of aura.

704
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,600
That we shared something special.

705
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:29,600
Teaching.

706
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,900
Thirty-nine years, I taught
American History at Wabasha High.

707
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,400
History, <i>it's</i> so romantic.

708
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,200
Great dental plan.

709
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,500
The ideas you gave those young minds.

710
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,000
Kids think they know it all, right?

711
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,000
Once in a while you reach one.
You touch them somehow.

712
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,300
I did that once.

713
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,300
Really?

714
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:58,100
It was my New Deal lecture. I touched
a kid on his head while he was snoring.

715
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,700
You're so bad.

716
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,600
You know...

717
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,100
...Chuck, he...

718
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:12,800
I know.

719
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:18,800
We can be thankful that we had
the privilege of knowing him...

720
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,400
...while he was here.

721
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,700
To Chuck.

722
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,000
Yes, to Chuck.

723
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,100
Thank you, John.

724
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,500
It was a wonderful evening.

725
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,200
Thank you, Ariel.

726
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:05,200
Pop?

727
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,100
- What?
- You think I should call her?

728
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,200
- What?
- The woman.

729
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,300
Well, let me tell you something, John.

730
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,200
The first 90 years, or so...

731
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,000
...go by pretty fast.

732
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,400
What?

733
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,600
The first 90 years go by fast.

734
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,000
How would you know?

735
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,600
You're just a damn kid.

736
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,600
I <i>didn't</i> say it, you did.

737
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,400
Well, they do. They do go fast.

738
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,600
Then one day you wake up.

739
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,400
And you realize...

740
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,300
...that you're not 81 anymore.

741
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,200
You begin to count the minutes
rather than the days...

742
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:43,000
...and you realize that pretty soon
you'll be gone.

743
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,500
And that all you have, see,
is the experiences.

744
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,000
<i>That's</i> all there is.

745
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,700
Everything! The experiences!

746
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,000
You mount the woman, son.

747
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,700
Or else...

748
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,100
...send her out to me.

749
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,800
I happened to come by these two tickets
for the Gopher game and...

750
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,600
Ever play much ice hockey?

751
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,800
We had an appointment!

752
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,400
There she is. Wabasha.

753
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,800
It is just beautiful.

754
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,300
Yeah, from up here... I used to
camp up here when I was a kid.

755
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:26,800
What are you thinking?

756
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,100
Oh, <i>I'm</i> sorry.

757
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,300
The snow...

758
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:35,900
...reminds me of the last Christmas
with my husband.

759
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,000
Are you all right?

760
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,200
Yes, an angel.

761
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,000
What?

762
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:46,600
<i>I'm</i> making a snow angel.

763
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,500
I remember.

764
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,100
Do you believe in angels?

765
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,200
They're all around us.

766
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,700
You've got to look hard, but...

767
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,100
...they're there...

768
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,900
...whenever anything good
happens to us.

769
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,500
I think I see one.

770
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,800
I'll have you mated in three moves.

771
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,400
<i>Shouldn't</i> we get to know each other
a little better first?

772
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:29,300
You have a wonderful smile.
You should wear it more often.

773
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,500
I bring it out on special occasions.

774
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,100
Tell me <i>who's</i> this?

775
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,100
- What?
- Over here.

776
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,200
<i>That's</i> my dad. <i>That's</i> Pop.

777
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,300
This handsome guy, you know him, right?

778
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,800
My daughter Melanie and her mother,
and Melanie and her husband, Mike.

779
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,200
<i>She's</i> beautiful.

780
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,100
Who are these people here?

781
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,300
Ah, that little girl is Alexandra,
my granddaughter.

782
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,500
And my son, Brian.

783
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,300
<i>He's</i> so handsome.

784
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,900
Lost him in Vietnam.

785
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:03,700
- <i>I'm</i> so sorry.
- <i>It's</i> all right. <i>It's</i> okay.

786
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,700
These little guys.

787
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,000
<i>That's</i> me and the moron.

788
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,000
Of course <i>it's</i> Max. <i>He's</i> ugly <i>isn't</i> he?

789
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,100
You mean you were friends?

790
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,200
I was 10, and <i>didn't</i> know any better.

791
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,800
What makes two men spend
most of their lives fighting?

792
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,100
Guess.

793
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,400
A woman.

794
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,800
How romantic.

795
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,500
No, it <i>wasn't</i> romantic at all.

796
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,600
Well...

797
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,200
What did I know? I was just a kid.

798
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,200
Which I am not anymore.

799
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,700
I think <i>it's</i> kind of late.

800
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,000
<i>It's</i> time for bed.

801
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,900
God, you are dumb, dumb, dumb.

802
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,200
Ariel, <i>I'm</i> sorry that...

803
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,700
I thought you said...

804
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I said <i>it's</i> time for bed.

805
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,200
Well, wait, what about...

806
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,900
- What?
- Well, you've been seeing...

807
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,100
Max?

808
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,100
<i>He's</i> just my friend.

809
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,800
The last man I slept with
was my husband.

810
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:39,700
Wait a minute!

811
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,400
Wait a minute!

812
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,000
<i>I'm</i> not prepared.

813
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:51,600
These days they say
you have to do safe sex.

814
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,200
When was the last time you made love?

815
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,700
October... fourth...

816
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,000
...1978.

817
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,700
Oh, I think we're safe.

818
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,500
Good morning.

819
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,300
Are those for me?

820
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:47,700
Oh, they're just beautiful. Thank you.

821
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,800
They're for you. I got them for you.

822
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,300
Thank you. How sweet!

823
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:55,000
That's...

824
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,100
Got them for you.

825
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,900
Snake in the grass!

826
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,700
Burn, baby, burn.

827
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,800
Holy shit! Max!

828
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,300
Stop the car, you idiot!

829
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,300
Look out!

830
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:39,400
Look out!

831
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,800
Max, you've really lost it!

832
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,200
Dirty little bastard!

833
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,900
He belongs in a rubber room.

834
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:25,000
I fixed your fishing pole!

835
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,500
Who cares about a damn fishing pole?

836
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:29,600
You can shove that pole!

837
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:33,000
You think a lousy old pole
is going to replace her?

838
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,700
Are you crazy?

839
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,400
<i>Don't</i> egg him on!

840
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:42,800
Leave him alone.

841
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
We'll settle this thing.

842
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,700
Cut it out!

843
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,100
Shrimp, you're not going anywhere!

844
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:57,400
Come on!

845
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,600
You broke my nose, schmuck.

846
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,900
I did not.

847
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,900
Look at that! What the hell
has gotten into you?

848
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,900
You stole her!

849
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:17,800
What?

850
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:18,800
<i>She's</i> mine.

851
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,000
- Says who?
- Says me.

852
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,800
She came to me!

853
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,900
You're stealing her away, just like May.

854
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:29,200
Could I remind you, Einstein,
May was no prize.

855
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,600
She was to me.

856
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:33,000
I was married to the woman 20 years.
She was no prize!

857
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,700
She was to me!

858
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:35,800
Moron!

859
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,600
If <i>you'd</i> ended up with May, you <i>wouldn't</i>
have had Amy, who was a good woman.

860
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,800
- She was the best.
- And more loyal than May ever was!

861
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:43,600
So!

862
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,200
So what?

863
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,600
Well, did you?

864
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:03,400
You know!

865
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,600
<i>That's</i> a private matter.

866
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:07,600
Private, my foot. Did you?

867
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,600
- I <i>can't</i> say.
- Tell me.

868
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,400
Okay, we did the horizontal mambo!
We danced it.

869
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,200
It was the greatest sex I ever had
in my life. Are you happy?

870
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:17,600
I'll kill you!

871
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Dirty rat!

872
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,000
Drop that fish!

873
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,000
<i>Don't</i> make me have
to separate you two again!

874
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,800
Now go to your shanties, all of you!

875
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,400
You're scaring the fish away!

876
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,400
Damn kids!

877
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:52,700
Kids! You <i>can't</i> live with them,
<i>can't</i> shoot them. Now go on!

878
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:57,200
How you going to take care
of her, Gustafson?

879
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:01,100
How are you going to support her...

880
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:03,000
...when the I.R.S. Takes your house?

881
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:10,500
I <i>can't</i> wait around for another Amy.
I <i>ain't</i> got time.

882
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,400
This time you win.

883
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:31,100
If you <i>won't</i> keep our date,
I'll bring the date to you.

884
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:36,100
You promised to come over and
give me the New Deal lecture...

885
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:38,400
- So like a good student...
- <i>What's</i> that?

886
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,300
A gift.

887
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,300
You inspired it.

888
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,200
I <i>can't</i> accept it.

889
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:54,900
Why not?

890
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:03,700
It might be a good idea if
we <i>didn't</i> see each other.

891
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,800
For a while. And, well, give each of us
a chance to be alone and...

892
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,700
But I thought...

893
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:16,200
Goddamn it. In the first place,
<i>I'm</i> too old for you. Okay?

894
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:18,000
I <i>don't</i> like...

895
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:20,100
...you coming over here.

896
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:23,400
I <i>don't</i> like you hanging around
here all day long!

897
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,000
<i>I'm</i> not afraid to be alone like you.

898
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:30,900
I am not afraid to be alone!
I just prefer...

899
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:32,400
...to experience things...

900
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:35,900
...and not watch them on television
or out the windows like you do.

901
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,600
<i>Don't</i> you understand?
I like being alone!

902
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,400
I understand.

903
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,100
I understand completely.

904
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,600
You know nothing about me.

905
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,600
I do too!

906
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:50,400
I know the only things in life that
you regret are the risks you <i>don't</i> take.

907
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,600
But you <i>wouldn't</i> understand that.

908
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,700
Because you're too pig-headed.

909
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:50,300
Merry Christmas.

910
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,000
Congratulations on the election.

911
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,800
<i>That's</i> old news. Where've you been?

912
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I had all this stuff that
I had to get taken care of.

913
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:02,300
Melanie said <i>she's</i> going
to come by tonight.

914
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,000
For Christmas Eve. Around 9:00.

915
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,600
Why <i>don't</i> you drop over?

916
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,300
I'll do that.

917
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,400
This neighborhood will be a lot safer
without that snowmobile around.

918
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,600
- Hi, Jacob.
- Hello, putz.

919
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,200
Merry Christmas, John.

920
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,800
Your cat crapped on my steps again.

921
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,700
Who says you <i>can't</i> train a cat?

922
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:47,900
<i>It's</i> a warning. If it happens again
I'll punch you in the nose.

923
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,600
He started it.

924
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,200
<i>Where's Santa's</i> favorite little girl?

925
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:12,700
Merry Christmas, Dad.

926
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,700
What, no twinkle lights?

927
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,600
I forgot about them this year.

928
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:27,700
Be polite.

929
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:32,000
Merry Christmas.

930
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,400
Can I put Allie in your bed?

931
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:37,700
Sure.

932
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:41,200
Come on, bedtime.
Say good night to grandpa.

933
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,400
How've you been?

934
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:49,300
Lousy. Thought you two
were getting a divorce.

935
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,000
Actually, <i>it's</i> only a separation.

936
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:58,400
I had to work some things out
for myself before we could work on us.

937
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:01,000
Did you get it worked out?

938
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,900
As far as I can tell.

939
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,800
<i>That's</i> great, Mike.

940
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Maybe the rest of us should put
our lives on hold for the next...

941
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:20,800
...two weeks while you fill up with
enough booze to make up your mind.

942
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,400
You know...

943
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:30,700
...I need a beer.

944
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,300
Grab a beer. <i>It's</i> in the fridge.

945
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:38,100
- <i>What's</i> wrong?
- I <i>don't</i> know.

946
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:40,100
Grab me one too!

947
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:42,400
Dad, try and understand...

948
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:45,200
...he says <i>he's</i> all straightened out.

949
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:50,100
What do I know? <i>I'm</i> 68 years old!
I got no house, no wife, no pension!

950
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:51,400
What are you saying?

951
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,500
I <i>don't</i> know one damn thing,
but I know this:

952
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:59,300
The only thing in this life that you
regret are the risks you <i>didn't</i> take.

953
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,400
If you see a chance to be happy...

954
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,600
...grab it with both hands and
to hell with the consequences.

955
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,800
I <i>can't</i> find a bottle opener.

956
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,500
Sweetheart, <i>I'm</i> going to walk down
to Slippery's.

957
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:25,000
What?

958
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,000
Hey, Jakey. Merry Christmas.

959
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,600
Merry Christmas.

960
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,600
Is this a bad time?

961
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:42,500
<i>I'm</i> sorry. I <i>don't</i> know <i>what's</i> wrong
with him. He just exploded.

962
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:44,400
You want me to go after him?

963
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,600
He'll cool off down at Slippery's.
Come on in.

964
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:51,800
<i>What's</i> that?

965
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,500
This is broccoli.

966
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,200
Pop <i>didn't</i> have mistletoe.

967
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,300
Hey, Mike. You're next big guy.

968
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,100
Hi, stinky.

969
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:12,400
I just came by to wish you all
a Merry Christmas.

970
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,400
That was sweet, Jacob.
<i>Wasn't</i> that sweet, Mike?

971
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Sweet... and short.

972
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:26,900
Good to see you, Mike!

973
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,700
Could I ask you a favor?

974
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:33,800
Sure.

975
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,200
Could you have a word with your dad?

976
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,600
See if they <i>can't</i> make up for Christmas.

977
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:43,400
Sure. Absolutely.

978
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,900
That would be great.

979
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,600
Merry Christmas.

980
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,000
Merry Christmas.

981
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:59,600
Over to Gustafson's?

982
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,700
Melanie there?

983
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,400
She look good?

984
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:13,300
Very. She also looks
to still be married.

985
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:14,200
What?

986
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,600
<i>Mike's</i> back?!

987
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,100
Looks that way.

988
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,500
Melanie said that John...

989
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:21,900
...just exploded and walked out.

990
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
So?

991
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:25,800
So <i>what's</i> going on?

992
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,600
Nothing that <i>shouldn't</i>
have happened years ago.

993
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:38,200
He tried to steal her
away from me, but I won.

994
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,200
Could you at least talk to him?

995
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:47,400
My door is open.
He knows where to find me.

996
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,700
He started it.

997
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,800
I <i>don't</i> care who started it,
you're going to end it.

998
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:57,200
I <i>don't</i> like him! I never liked him!

999
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:59,200
<i>It's</i> Christmas, Pop.

1000
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:02,700
You could go down to <i>Slippery's</i>
and make peace with the man.

1001
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:06,700
<i>I'd</i> rather kiss a dead <i>moose's</i> butt.

1002
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:14,200
This 1500-pound moose
is the real thing, folks.

1003
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:18,400
Reared by local volunteer firefighter,
Peter Carlson, of Wabasha.

1004
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:21,800
He found it injured while hunting,
brought it home...

1005
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,900
...and raised it in his home.

1006
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,500
Merry Christmas.

1007
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:44,600
Moron.

1008
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,100
Putz.

1009
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,800
Jacob says Mike and Melanie
are getting back together.

1010
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:59,800
He <i>doesn't</i> know his ass from a hole
in the ground. They're divorcing.

1011
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,900
I got some things I wanted to tell you.

1012
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:10,200
The reason I came down here tonight is...

1013
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:11,900
I wanted to tell...

1014
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Hurry! I <i>haven't</i> got all night.

1015
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,700
- <i>Don't</i> shout!
- <i>I'm</i> not.

1016
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:20,600
Bust my tuchus to come here and
thank you and all you do is shout at me.

1017
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,400
To thank me?

1018
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:26,800
All right, I take it back.
I <i>don't</i> thank you.

1019
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,500
Jesus, <i>it's</i> impossible!

1020
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:38,300
Look, Goldman...

1021
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:42,000
I want to ask you something.

1022
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:46,900
Well, what? I <i>ain't</i> got all night
either. <i>I'm</i> just as busy as you are.

1023
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:49,200
Do you love her?

1024
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:52,200
Do I love her? What does that
have to do with anything?

1025
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:54,900
It would make the whole thing
worthwhile.

1026
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:59,900
You know something, I think you've
lost whatever marbles you ever had.

1027
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:03,200
Do you think you walked
on coals for me?

1028
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:06,500
Gave me back my fishing pole
and I said, ''T hank <i>you.''</i>

1029
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,000
Fishing pole?

1030
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,900
Pisses me off you broke it
but, schmuck that you are...

1031
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:14,900
...I got to be realistic.

1032
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:19,200
- <i>What's</i> so funny?
- You think this is about that pole?

1033
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,500
- <i>What's</i> it about?
- Forget it.

1034
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,700
What do you mean forget it?

1035
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:24,700
I want to know.

1036
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:26,200
You really want to know?

1037
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:37,200
What about her?

1038
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,200
You made me feel sorry for you.

1039
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:44,900
She chose me!

1040
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,900
She did!

1041
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:50,000
And if anyone says otherwise
they're a damn liar!

1042
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:52,800
<i>What's</i> the difference?
You got her anyway.

1043
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,000
What are you looking at?

1044
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,100
Stupid moron!

1045
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,800
Stupid idiot!

1046
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,200
It makes a difference, damn it!

1047
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:12,000
Dirty rat. Little turd.

1048
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:21,800
Oh, my God!

1049
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:28,400
Are you dead?

1050
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:34,800
Not yet. But I <i>don't</i> want to die
looking at your ugly face.

1051
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:36,700
Stay there!

1052
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:37,800
Stay there!

1053
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:41,300
Wait a minute. I'll be right back!

1054
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,600
Help!

1055
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:48,900
We need a...

1056
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,200
<i>It's</i> an emergency!

1057
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:54,400
Emergency! We need an ambulance!
Somebody dial ''911.''

1058
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,800
Could you tell me...

1059
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,000
Oh, nurse... nurse.

1060
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:10,000
Nurse, could you tell me where
Mr. John Gustafson is?

1061
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:11,700
Are you friend or family?

1062
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:13,800
What?

1063
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,100
Are you friend or family, sir?

1064
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:27,700
Friend.

1065
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:02,900
Merry Christmas, John.

1066
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:08,800
You putz.

1067
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:29,300
Well, <i>you'd</i> better have a good reason
for standing me up this morning.

1068
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:33,800
<i>What's</i> wrong?

1069
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,600
Can I come in?

1070
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:40,000
Sure.

1071
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:58,000
I know you wanted to get rid of me,
but <i>isn't</i> this a little drastic?

1072
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:09,000
My husband passed away at Easter.

1073
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:14,200
If you leave me at Christmas, I <i>won't</i>
have any holidays to look forward to.

1074
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:15,900
Except maybe...

1075
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:17,600
...Thanksgiving, and...

1076
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:19,000
...I really...

1077
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,200
<i>...I'm</i> not crazy about turkey.

1078
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,400
So, what do you say?

1079
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:27,900
<i>Let's</i> go.

1080
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:29,300
All right.

1081
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,100
Okay, I can wait.

1082
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:50,900
He could be dead tomorrow!

1083
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:53,400
<i>I'm</i> sorry your friend is sick...

1084
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:56,800
...but the court order is in
and my hands are tied.

1085
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:59,300
Check the bedroom. File the paperwork.

1086
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:03,900
<i>He's</i> straight as a <i>grizzly's</i> dick!
<i>He'd</i> never cheat on his taxes!

1087
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,800
<i>It's</i> not a matter of cheating!

1088
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,200
<i>It's</i> a matter of miscalculation.

1089
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:13,200
He got health benefits for 20 years
while claiming as a married man.

1090
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:16,500
However, he omitted to inform us that...

1091
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:20,000
...his ex-wife had a part-time job
for 11 of those 20 years.

1092
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,400
Had he done so,
<i>we'd</i> have informed him...

1093
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,800
...that, because of her income...

1094
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,400
...a larger portion of those benefits
were subject to federal taxes.

1095
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,500
About $13,000.

1096
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:34,400
He can raise that.

1097
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:35,700
However...

1098
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:39,100
...that amount when combined with...

1099
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:44,300
...11 years worth of interest,
late charges, and penalties...

1100
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:49,700
...comes out at about $57,000.
Ballpark.

1101
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:54,100
<i>He'd</i> never find that.

1102
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,400
He will when we sell his house.

1103
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,800
The furniture goes to the auction house.

1104
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:30,000
Any paperwork,
put in the back of my car, okay?

1105
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:32,300
Beautiful day.

1106
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:38,600
Do the world a favor and pull your lip
over your head and swallow.

1107
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:43,700
Asshole!

1108
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,200
Bloodsuckers!

1109
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,200
Max <i>what's</i> going on?

1110
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:53,500
Anyone looking?

1111
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:55,400
No, why?

1112
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:03,500
We got a problem.

1113
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,700
- What is it?
- <i>Somebody's</i> barricaded the doors.

1114
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:08,900
Wait a minute.

1115
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:10,900
What?

1116
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:13,000
Break in the door!

1117
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,600
Watch this.

1118
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,500
We'll see about this.

1119
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:25,500
This <i>isn't</i> going to stop me,
Mr. Goldman.

1120
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,300
I got him right where I want him.

1121
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:41,800
Got it, just like you said.

1122
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:43,400
You <i>don't</i> understand.

1123
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:44,800
I can handle it.

1124
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:48,400
<i>I'm</i> Jacob Goldman, mayor of Wabasha.

01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,300
You look great.

1128
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,900
Thanks, so do you.

1129
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:04,100
I mean it. People always try to be nice
by saying you look great but...

1130
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:05,700
...you really do look great.

1131
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:07,400
I feel good.

1132
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:09,000
How are you?

1133
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:11,100
<i>I'm</i> good, Jacob.

1134
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,700
Listen, <i>I'm</i> sorry about the...

1135
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:17,800
Divorce. Thanks.

1136
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:20,700
<i>I'm</i> just glad <i>it's</i> over and done with.

1137
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,700
You must be.

1138
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:27,900
Ready for this?

1139
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,500
No, not really.

1140
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:36,000
Listen, if you need someone
to talk to tonight...

1141
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:37,800
<i>...I'm</i> staying at Pop's.

1142
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:40,200
Thanks, Jacob.

1143
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:41,700
<i>I'd</i> like that.

1144
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:43,300
Hey, you two!

1145
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,900
Get your asses in here!

1146
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:49,400
I guess <i>it's</i> time.

1147
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,200
Where have you been?

1148
01:30:58,300 --> 01:30:59,800
Relax. You nervous?

1149
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,500
The groom is nervous.

1150
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:04,400
- <i>I'm</i> not nervous, schmuck.
- <i>Don't</i> call me schmuck, putz.

1151
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:06,100
You're in a church!

1152
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:46,500
Wait!

1153
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:49,300
<i>Ain't</i> you forgetting something?!

1154
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:54,500
That'll do it.

1155
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:58,100
That'll do it, Dad!
I think that'll do it!

1156
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:59,600
Okay, here we go!

1157
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,700
You're the greatest.

1158
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:10,900
- I love you.
- Good-bye, pumpkin.

1159
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,100
<i>Here's</i> the house.

1160
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:19,200
Jacob paid the penalties and interest.
I paid the 13 grand.

1161
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,500
Wipe the smile off your face,
<i>it's</i> just a loan.

1162
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:29,100
I'll lay eight-to-five you <i>can't</i>
get it up the entire honeymoon.

1163
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:31,300
You're on.

1164
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:33,000
A sure winner.

1165
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,300
You smell something?

1166
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,100
What is that?

1167
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,200
That dirty son of a...

1168
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:12,800
What a putz!

1169
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:21,800
What do you feel like tonight,
Leno or Letterman?

1170
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:24,300
Tell me about it in the morning.

1171
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:25,900
Where are you going?

1172
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:31,200
The Daughters of the American Revolution
are having a dance at the V.F.W.

1173
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:33,200
Maybe I'll get lucky.

1174
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:34,800
<i>Don't</i> wait up for me.

1175
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:39,200
What have you got there?

1176
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:40,400
Broccoli.

1177
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:42,400
Holy moly!

1178
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,900
<i>He's</i> in. <i>He's</i> in!

1179
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:55,900
Looks like <i>he's</i> going to enter
the holy of holies.

1180
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:58,600
Coitus uninterruptus.

1181
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:03,200
I throw back what <i>I'm</i> not going to eat.

1182
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:06,500
Like that 40-pound muskie
you're always yakking about?

1183
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,700
<i>It's</i> a shame that...

1184
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:13,400
...that your uncle has a fish market
on 23rd Street and 14th Avenue.

1185
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:14,700
Twenty-sixth.

1186
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:16,800
Twenty-sixth Street, you dummy!

1187
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,200
You schmuck!

1188
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:23,700
Yeah. It looks like <i>Chuck's</i>
slipping her the old salami.

1189
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:25,600
Oh, Jesus, Dad!

1190
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:34,800
<i>I'm</i> Ronald Reagan. I used to be
President of the United States.

1191
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,600
- I live across the street.
- Yes, come in.

1192
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:41,700
I was also in the movies.
I was a lousy actor.

1193
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:47,200
Looks like <i>Chuck's</i> going to put
the hot dog in the bun.

1194
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:49,600
Oh, jeez, Dad!

1195
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:52,100
<i>That's</i> why I came down.

1196
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:54,500
- Spit it out!
- <i>Don't</i> shout at me!

1197
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:55,800
<i>I'm</i> not!

1198
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,400
Bust my tuchus to get
here on New <i>Year's</i> Eve...

1199
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:01,600
...or on Christmas, or whatever the...

1200
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,200
Looks like Chuck's...

1201
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,300
...a tomcat on the prowl.

1202
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:13,900
My pinched sciatica would make
your lumbago look like eyestrain.

1203
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:18,700
Is it? Does he? Would he? Is he...

1204
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:20,300
Yes, he is.

1205
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:25,000
Looks like Chuck is taking
the old log to the beaver.

1206
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:28,800
Looks like <i>Chuck's</i>
going to bury his boner.

1207
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
<i>That's</i> right, you're a moron!

1208
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:32,600
If you <i>hadn't</i> had Amy...

1209
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:47,400
It looks like Chuck is taking
the skin boat to tuna town.

1210
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:52,900
Looks like Chuck is taking the ride
on the wild baloney pony.

1211
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,400
Who left?

1212
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:02,900
If I knew there was a nude scene,
<i>I'd</i> have asked for another million.
