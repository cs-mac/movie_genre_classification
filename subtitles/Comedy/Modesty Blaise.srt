1
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,600
Mmm.

2
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,600
Thank you.

3
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,300
Read this to me, please.

4
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,600
"Scorpio... not like you
to be lazy...

5
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,600
"but today it is an effort
to exert yourself.

6
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,300
"Best to turn your attention
to anything new...

7
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,300
"as this will be a stimulant.

8
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,100
Don't take a partner
for granted. "

9
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,565
Ah.

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,600
Here's what I want packed.

11
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:11,700
The list of my...

12
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,700
accessories.

13
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,600
Oh!

14
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,000
Idiot!
That one's at the cleaners.

15
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,900
Oh!

16
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,800
# Modesty #

17
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,500
# Modesty #

18
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,100
# She is the shadow
on your bedroom wall #

19
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,700
# She is the dream
you never found #

20
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,700
# But then you find
no time to dream at all #

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,800
# Whenever
Modesty's around #

22
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,550
# Modesty #

23
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:19,165
# Modesty #

24
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,100
# She'll strike you dumb
with just a single glance #

25
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,700
# Or just a single
glancing blow #

26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,300
# Exactly why she slays
so many men #

27
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,600
# No man alive
will ever know #

28
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,000
# Modesty #

29
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:40,265
# Modesty #

30
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,965
# She'll turn your head #

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,700
# Though she might use
a judo hold #

32
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,700
# And on her shoulders #

33
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,700
# A chip made of solid gold #

34
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,400
# If you're a master
of the underworld #

35
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,000
# You'll be accepted
in her queue #

36
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,700
# She is the perfect mistress
of her art #

37
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,200
# She is the perfect
mistress too #

38
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,000
# Modesty #

39
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,000
# Modesty #

40
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,100
Modesty Blaise?

41
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,600
Why on earth
do we need Modesty Blaise?

42
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,600
We have our very best man
on the job.

43
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,300
Oh, dear me.
That's bad luck.

44
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,900
No use crying
over spilt milk.

45
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,100
The diamonds must be got
through to the sheik.

46
00:05:31,135 --> 00:05:32,800
Hear! Hear!

47
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,800
Hear! Hear!

48
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,800
We've no alternative.
We must have Modesty Blaise.

49
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,000
With your permission, sir...

50
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,900
a massive military maneuver
to impress the enemy.

51
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,900
Hear! Hear!

52
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,600
Hear! Hear!

53
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,700
Fine. You don't even know
who the enemy is.

54
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
And if the wrong people
heard about it...

55
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,600
the sheik would
lose his head.

56
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,300
We'll lose the oil concession.

57
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,700
Tarrant, who was that
young person...

58
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,700
that you suggested?

59
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,800
The young lady's name,
Minister...

60
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,800
is Modesty Blaise.

61
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,900
Ha ha! Use a thief
to catch a thief.

62
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You won't be able
to persuade her, Tarrant.

63
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,100
She's retired,
with a large fortune...

64
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,800
and planning to get married.

65
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,100
David will never
forgive me for this.

66
00:06:38,135 --> 00:06:40,065
You're fond of him?

67
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,300
He's the sort of man
I could marry.

68
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,700
Modesty Blaise somebody's
private property?

69
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,200
Never.

70
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,600
You appreciate, Miss Blez...

71
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,900
Blaise, sir.

72
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,900
Blaise... that what you
are seeing is top-secret.

73
00:07:00,935 --> 00:07:03,300
That is the kingdom
of Casara...

74
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,500
Masara, sir.

75
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,500
Masara... scarcely large enough
to be on the map.

76
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,800
About the size
of England and Wales.

77
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,200
We turned everything
over to the natives 10...

78
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,565
15.

79
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,065
15 years ago.

80
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,600
Since then, of course...

81
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,800
the place has gone to seed.

82
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,700
- The revolution, led by
the sheik's first cousin...

83
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,900
Second cousin.

84
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,900
Second cousin...
a man who claims...

85
00:07:36,935 --> 00:07:38,500
to be a trade unionist.

86
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Right-wing, of course.

87
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,600
Ah, that's the sheik himself.

88
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,900
Retired cutthroat
called Abu Tahir.

89
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,900
I know him well.

90
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,800
Do you?

91
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,600
What do you want me to do?

92
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,500
For practical purposes...

93
00:08:02,535 --> 00:08:04,100
Abu Tahir is a democrat...

94
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,700
and we support him.

95
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,200
In exchange for a small
oil concession...

96
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,200
we are sending him
a small contribution.

97
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,900
You have very pretty ears.

98
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,800
What sort of contribution?

99
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,000
£50,000 in diamonds.

100
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,400
Millions, Minister.

101
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:22,700
Millions, millions.

102
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,500
Who's trying
to stop the shipment?

103
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,600
That is what we want
you to find out.

104
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,400
It should be easy for you...

105
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,700
with your connections
in the world of crime.

106
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,900
Adventure, surely.

107
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,200
Adventure.

108
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,400
If I help you,
you will trust me completely.

109
00:08:41,435 --> 00:08:43,700
You'll give me
all the information.

110
00:08:43,735 --> 00:08:45,700
Every bit, of course.

111
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:51,000
If you deceive me,
I may take your diamonds.

112
00:08:51,035 --> 00:08:53,000
Ha ha!

113
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,800
I take my fee
in Swiss francs in advance...

114
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,600
and I want Willie Garvin.

115
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,100
Who's Willie Garvin?

116
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,465
No, Modesty.

117
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,800
Who's Willie Garvin?

118
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,500
I won't do it without Willie.

119
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,500
We've already
checked on your Willie.

120
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,800
If you're prepared to transport
yourself to South America...

121
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:25,800
cross two rivers
full of alligators...

122
00:09:25,835 --> 00:09:27,800
hack your way
through a jungle...

123
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,400
and then seduce
a military governor...

124
00:09:31,435 --> 00:09:34,100
well, uh, perhaps.

125
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,065
Hello.

126
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,400
Hello, Willie.

127
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,000
Princess.
Don't go away, love.

128
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,100
I am talking to a man who says
you are in South America.

129
00:10:00,135 --> 00:10:02,000
For you,
I've just come back.

130
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,600
Doing anything, Willie?

131
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,000
Nah. Near nothing
as makes no difference.

132
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,800
Oy! Let go.

133
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,100
Where is the fire, princess?

134
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,600
Are you free?

135
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,300
As a bird.
What makes you think different?

136
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,300
I thought you spoke
to someone.

137
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,900
Nah! Only to you.

138
00:10:20,935 --> 00:10:22,400
Can you come now?

139
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,400
Now, yesterday, tomorrow...

140
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,900
You name it.

141
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Now, Willie.
I want you to come now.

142
00:10:30,035 --> 00:10:31,800
'Course.
I'm chuffed, princess.

143
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,600
I hate laying about,
don't I?

144
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,700
Now? Why not?

145
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,200
Bye!

146
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,500
Ha ha ha ha ha!

147
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,600
I don't know how much
you know about Arab etiquette...

148
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,100
but the one thing to avoid
above all is familiarity.

149
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,600
Ah! These chaps are
as proud as Lucifer...

150
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,200
and a woman
amongst Muslims...

151
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,900
has to be
particularly careful.

152
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,800
- Bam!
- Wham!

153
00:11:23,835 --> 00:11:25,400
Thank you, ma'am!

154
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,400
Ha ha ha!

155
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,200
Sir George.

156
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,665
Uh, Sir Gerald.

157
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,800
It is the Muslims who must be
careful with Modesty Blaise.

158
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,300
Entrez-vous, Sir Gerald.

159
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,600
He is here...

160
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,100
My son Modesty...

161
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,400
who is also my daughter.

162
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,700
I might have known you two
would know each other.

163
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,700
Know each other?
She is my son.

164
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,000
There must have been
a technical problem or two.

165
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,500
Faith, Sir Gerald,
can move mountains.

166
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,600
These are the sons
of my body.

167
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,600
Sir Gerald.

168
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,400
Once upon a time...

169
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,400
a little girl comes to Masara...

170
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,365
all bones and eyes...

171
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,600
fierce and proud, like a...

172
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,100
like a...

173
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,800
eaglet.

174
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,800
With claws like so...

175
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,800
too fierce to be
a daughter.

176
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,500
He made me his son
and taught me how to fight.

177
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
After our country
got independence...

178
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,300
a couple of idiot
relatives of mine...

179
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,300
decided to move in
and take over things.

180
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,900
Naturally,
I sent for Modesty.

181
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,100
She came like a shot
with Willie Garvin.

182
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,300
What a character!

183
00:13:11,335 --> 00:13:13,400
Terrific guy!

184
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,200
We must take you
grouse shooting this autumn.

185
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,600
A little present for you,
my son.

186
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,900
For me?

187
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,400
It will help you
in your work.

188
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,400
Ahh!

189
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,400
The most beautiful thing
I've ever seen!

190
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,200
It's not functional,
of course?

191
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,900
No, no, no, no!
Don't, please!

192
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,300
It's pointing directly
at Buckingham Palace!

193
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,400
Come, Modesty.
We'll try the other window.

194
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,600
There's a better view
from there.

195
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,700
Ha ha ha!

196
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
Ha ha ha!

197
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,900
We're alone.

198
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,800
Modesty, who is the enemy?

199
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,400
I don't know yet.

200
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,800
There's only one man who would
dare to steal from Abu Tahir.

201
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,400
But Gabriel is dead.

202
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,000
He's home, Mr. McWhirter.

203
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,600
Aye.
On time, as usual.

204
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,700
McWhirter speaking.
McWhirter speaking.

205
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,300
He is home.

206
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,900
He is home.

207
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,300
Dear Clara Fothergill.

208
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:24,700
Three and four.

209
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,800
One and two...

210
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,300
and three and four.

211
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,700
One and two...

212
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,400
and three and four!

213
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,700
You may rest.

214
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,700
It's your own fault, Basilio.

215
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,300
You eat too much.

216
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,600
Weakling!

217
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,000
Ugh!

218
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,500
Glad to have you back,
Mr. Gabriel. How was the trip?

219
00:17:54,535 --> 00:17:55,600
Tedious.

220
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,100
London was lucrative...

221
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,800
but Scotland
remains the bastion...

222
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,200
of bonny-bred
bluebell boredom.

223
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,900
We were nine for dinner.

224
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,500
A criminologist...

225
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,900
rather overeager...

226
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,200
with a floral tie
and dandruff.

227
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,300
We talked about Gabriel.

228
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,900
He said that Gabriel had
the only true criminal mind.

229
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
His only motive was malice.

230
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:57,600
Rather unkind.

231
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,200
Mamma was most amused...

232
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,400
and very condescending
to me, as usual.

233
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,700
You know, McWhirter,
one of these days...

234
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,700
I shall have to
tell her who I am.

235
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,100
We've got the clown
who tried to betray us.

236
00:19:11,135 --> 00:19:13,500
Betray? We use
overdramatic language.

237
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,750
"Gave us away"
is quite enough.

238
00:19:15,785 --> 00:19:17,900
Who do you mean...
Crevier?

239
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,200
Aye. He arrived air freight
from Amsterdam.

240
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,900
C.O.D.

241
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,900
Poor Crevier.

242
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,900
He suffers quite
frightfully from cramp.

243
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,600
How delightful!

244
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,950
Ah! Enter Mrs. Fothergill.

245
00:19:37,985 --> 00:19:40,800
Well, it's about time.

246
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,800
How are your tiny ones?

247
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,200
Mmm, not in shape, I fear.

248
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,600
Basilio manufactures
carbohydrates!

249
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,600
Gabriel, you promised me Crevier.

250
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,300
That clown!

251
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,600
You promised!

252
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,300
You practically promised.

253
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,600
Si tu veux, cherie,
mais va doucement.

254
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,965
Pas devant
mes domestiques.

255
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,100
Now, you know I don't
understand a word of your French.

256
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,000
Mrs. Fothergill
has been restless...

257
00:20:14,035 --> 00:20:15,465
in your absence, sir.

258
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,100
In the full moon,
I fear for me life.

259
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,600
Quite without reason,
McWhirter.

260
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,000
She wouldn't waste
her energies on you.

261
00:20:22,035 --> 00:20:24,300
Have you worked out
the latest figures?

262
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,700
Aye.

263
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,900
The books look just fine
at the moment.

264
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,500
Then I should allow a separate
contingency of £50,000.

265
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,000
What for?

266
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,500
Modesty Blaise.

267
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
Is she with us?

268
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,700
No, alas.

269
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,200
Against us once again.

270
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,700
The totals for the month
are rather below average.

271
00:20:50,735 --> 00:20:53,800
On the other hand,
the accounts for your trip...

272
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,165
are rather disquieting.

273
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,165
For example,
sex in June... £30,000.

274
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,400
You've no sense of the true
value of money, McWhirter.

275
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,500
Nevertheless, it all affects
the final balance sheet.

276
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,800
I'm happy to say,
on the other hand...

277
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,300
that the total for death...

278
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,600
is only £2,
17 and sixpence...

279
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,000
Crevier not included.

280
00:21:13,035 --> 00:21:14,700
Yet.

281
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,500
You're not concentrating,
McWhirter.

282
00:21:30,535 --> 00:21:33,500
Come sit here in this chair.

283
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,300
How did you explain
Crevier to the friar?

284
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,300
I told him he was
an atomic scientist...

285
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:45,200
caught selling secrets
in the public loo...

286
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,200
in the Piazza di Spagna.

287
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,765
Did he believe you?

288
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,700
He said he wasn't
born yesterday.

289
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,000
If I may quote
Merritt and Sykes...

290
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,500
Must you?

291
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,400
"Faulty financial analysis...

292
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,600
is a very common occurrence. "

293
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,300
"Where the financial
implications of a project...

294
00:22:09,335 --> 00:22:12,017
"have not been
fully thought out...

295
00:22:12,052 --> 00:22:14,700
some items
in the investment...

296
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,100
"or some of
the cash advantages...

297
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,000
may have been omitted. "

298
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,600
Carry on, McWhirter.

299
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,100
"Or the financial analysis...

300
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,500
"may have been
performed in a way...

301
00:22:27,535 --> 00:22:29,800
"that arbitrarily
presents projects...

302
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,800
"in an unjustifiably attractive...

303
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,700
or unattractive way. "

304
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,200
"This is inevitably the consequence...

305
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,500
"of using crude methods...

306
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,100
such as the payback. "

307
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,800
If you knock down
the value of the diamonds...

308
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,000
by another million or two
in disposal...

309
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,050
it will leave
your property only...

310
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:34,000
We're not in this
for the money.

311
00:23:34,035 --> 00:23:36,000
Then what, may I ask, are...

312
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,700
Dear Clara.

313
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,900
Have you ever wondered
about Mr. Fothergill?

314
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,300
I am Mr. Fothergill.

315
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,600
This is the tallest
building in Amsterdam.

316
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,200
I hope you enjoy your visit.

317
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,900
I'm looking forward to meeting
this Modesty Blaise.

318
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,900
You warned immigration,
of course.

319
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,800
Yes. She's not very
popular with them.

320
00:25:08,835 --> 00:25:11,100
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

321
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,300
Danke.

322
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,300
What on earth
is Modesty Blaise...

323
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,800
doing in Rotterdam, Tarrant?

324
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,300
Amsterdam, Minister.

325
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,965
Amster... Rotter...

326
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,600
She's a decoy, Minister...

327
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,100
a decoy.

328
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,800
Honolulu.

329
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,400
The Maharajah's snuffbox.

330
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,800
Dublin. Ah.

331
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,700
Murder.

332
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,300
Well, Tarrant.
Now, what on earth is Modesty Blaise...

333
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,200
doing on a canal boat?

334
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,900
Our new man
is making contact...

335
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,200
through a mysterious
third party, Minister.

336
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,200
Does she know
that the diamonds...

337
00:27:18,235 --> 00:27:20,400
are really on
the Tyboria, Tarrant?

338
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,500
Oh, no, Minister.

339
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,400
We don't trust her.
We merely use her.

340
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,765
"If you deceive me...

341
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,300
I may take your diamonds. "

342
00:27:32,335 --> 00:27:34,165
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha!

343
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,300
In front of you,
you'll see ships...

344
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,600
from all over the world.

345
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,900
Tyboria, port of London...

346
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,600
Lisbon, Catania, Beirut.

347
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,300
A gauche, vieil Tyboria...

348
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,600
un cargo de Londres...

349
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,700
Lisbonne, Catania,
Beyrouth...

350
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,600
Sorry about the explosion.

351
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,100
It doesn't happen every day.

352
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,600
I don't come every day.

353
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,200
Perhaps you will recommend us
to your friends.

354
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,500
Maybe.

355
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,300
74 Haarlemmstraat,
apartment C.

356
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,800
Tarrant,
did you warn Miss Blaise...

357
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,800
about pushing doorbells
in Amsterdam?

358
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,800
Good heavens!

359
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,300
# Da-da da-da-da-da-da-da #

360
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,200
# Da-da da-da-da-da-da-da... #

361
00:32:53,235 --> 00:32:54,500
Pacco.

362
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,965
No.

363
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,200
Willie Garvin?

364
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,000
# Da-da-da-da-da-da #

365
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,800
# Da-da-da da-da-da-da-da... #

366
00:33:09,835 --> 00:33:10,800
Danke.

367
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,800
Thank you.

368
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,500
Danke.

369
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,300
# Da-da-da #

370
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,400
# Da-da da-da-da-da-da-da #

371
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,900
What on earth...

372
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,700
is Willie Garvin doing,
Tarrant?

373
00:33:25,735 --> 00:33:27,300
Collecting canaries.

374
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,800
Canaries?

375
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,400
Criminal slang, Minister.

376
00:33:31,435 --> 00:33:33,900
Canaries are birds that sing.

377
00:33:33,935 --> 00:33:35,365
Birds are...

378
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,900
Oh, never mind.
Never mind!

379
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,950
Mesdames et messieurs,
bonsoir.

380
00:33:41,985 --> 00:33:44,300
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

381
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,865
Signore e signori,
buona sera.

382
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,000
Introduciamos
lo spettacolo di magica...

383
00:33:50,035 --> 00:33:53,300
con la bella Melina.

384
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,100
And now,
ladies and gentlemen...

385
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,450
I would like to introduce...

386
00:34:03,485 --> 00:34:05,700
the charming,
the beautiful...

387
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,300
Nicole!

388
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,900
Ladies and gentlemen...

389
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,100
now I'm going to
introduce to you...

390
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,800
the best trick
of the 20th century.

391
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,700
Mesdames, mademoiselles,
et messieurs...

392
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,750
maintenant, quand on va montrer
les oeufs...

393
00:35:12,785 --> 00:35:15,700
voulez-vous, s'il vous plait,
regarder I'oeuf...

394
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,065
et le signore
avec un crayon noir?

395
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,200
Ca c'est le meilleur trick
du vingtieme siecle.

396
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,900
How's it going, love?

397
00:35:28,935 --> 00:35:30,000
Willie.

398
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,500
Come and tell me later.

399
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,900
I'm at 6 Bummstraat.

400
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,300
Ow!

401
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,600
Ahh!

402
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,900
Ow!

403
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,600
Mais, c'est mon cher Paul,
dis-donc!

404
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,300
Jacquelyn?

405
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,400
That's not bloody funny.
What are you doing here?

406
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,200
Oh, no.

407
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,700
It's Modesty Blaise.

408
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,600
Jacquelyn, you're not
Modesty Blaise?

409
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,400
I thought you'd be pleased.

410
00:37:30,435 --> 00:37:32,365
After Paris?

411
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,300
We weren't on
the same side then.

412
00:37:35,335 --> 00:37:36,900
Are we now?

413
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,800
Paris was a long time ago.

414
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,500
Only three years.

415
00:37:41,535 --> 00:37:42,700
Only?

416
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,400
Three years, two months...

417
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,300
4 days, and 25 minutes.

418
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,400
You two-faced,
cold-blooded, calculating...

419
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:57,100
Not cold blood, please.

420
00:37:57,135 --> 00:37:59,665
Well, who cares?

421
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,100
O.K., then, Modesty Blaise.

422
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,100
What the hell did you
do to the lights?

423
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,100
Nothing. I thought...

424
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,600
Even in our world...

425
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,400
fuses have been known
to blow from natural causes.

426
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,000
Jacquelyn.

427
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,500
Modesty.

428
00:38:32,535 --> 00:38:33,865
Mmm.

429
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,600
Were you deceiving me
all the time in Paris?

430
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,900
Do you think I can
control my heartbeats?

431
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,900
Quite probably.

432
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,600
I ought to strangle you.

433
00:38:55,635 --> 00:38:56,900
Try.

434
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,400
Oh!

435
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,800
How do you get it off?

436
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,200
So is this bird
about to talk?

437
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,600
Canary about
to sing, Minister.

438
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:29,400
Well, Garvin is working
on that assumption.

439
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,400
I hope it is not
her swan song.

440
00:39:32,435 --> 00:39:33,765
Heh!

441
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,500
Very sinister, Minister.

442
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,500
Now, how did you
get it on?

443
00:39:42,535 --> 00:39:43,800
Mmm.

444
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,300
Hmm?

445
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,500
How are you sending
the diamonds?

446
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,000
By RAF aircraft
from Schiphol...

447
00:39:54,035 --> 00:39:55,500
at 10:00 tomorrow night.

448
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,500
Mmm.

449
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,800
Sounds like a very good plan.

450
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,400
Oh, I'm glad you approve.

451
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,100
Mmm.

452
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,400
Modesty.

453
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,900
Hmm?

454
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,950
Where did you go
that last day in Paris...

455
00:40:09,985 --> 00:40:12,900
when you said you were
going to Balenciaga?

456
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,400
Christian Dior.

457
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,600
Where did you go
that day in Rome...

458
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:23,700
when you told me
you were going to Rio?

459
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,700
Huh?

460
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,400
Eh?

461
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,700
Oh, uh, Buenos Aires.

462
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,200
You're so cruel.

463
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,500
Who does Pacco take
his orders from?

464
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,100
I don't know.

465
00:40:36,135 --> 00:40:38,065
A bird.

466
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,300
You're so cruel.

467
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,400
Cruel?
I haven't touched you yet.

468
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,700
No.

469
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,500
Fothergill speaking.
Fothergill speaking.

470
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,400
Fothergill speaking.
Fothergill speaking.

471
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,100
Tell Gabriel
to get out of bed.

472
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,000
Modesty's in bed
with Englishman.

473
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,000
Willie is in bed
with Nicole.

474
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,200
What makes you think so?

475
00:41:16,235 --> 00:41:18,165
Gabriel's dead.

476
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,700
Did you see the body?

477
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,100
If you say it's Gabriel,
then it's Gabriel.

478
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,600
Woman's intuition.

479
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,065
Salaud!

480
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,100
All I said was
"woman's intuition. "

481
00:41:30,135 --> 00:41:32,500
What's the matter with that?

482
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,200
Salaud!

483
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,300
Now, stop acting like
a bloody-minded female!

484
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,600
Aah!

485
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,400
O.K., it was Gabriel!
It was Gabriel!

486
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,000
It was Gabriel!
It was Gabriel!

487
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,200
It was Gabriel!

488
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,965
Ahh.

489
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Now... I'm hungry.

490
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,600
You peasant.

491
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,600
All right.
I'll see what I can find.

492
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,600
Aah!

493
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,600
# Ba-da-da-dee-doo... #

494
00:42:46,635 --> 00:42:48,100
Modesty Blaise?

495
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,100
Pacco here.

496
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,365
Yes.

497
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,900
We have got Modesty Blaise.

498
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,400
Ah! Well done.

499
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,700
Five minutes late, Pacco.

500
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,200
You want Garvin?

501
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,800
Are you still underbudget?

502
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,800
If you haven't
got them both...

503
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,300
you haven't got either.

504
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,200
You're a fool, Pacco.

505
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,400
Come on.

506
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,500
Ha ha ha ha!

507
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,700
So you'll ask him over?

508
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,000
You're giving the party.

509
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,865
Ha ha!

510
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,265
We catch them...

511
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,000
and that Fothergill woman...

512
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,700
catch the fun.

513
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,900
She knows.
She always knows.

514
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,100
She's got an instinct for it.

515
00:43:48,135 --> 00:43:49,500
Hello, princess.

516
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,865
I need you here, Willie.

517
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,700
She needs me here.
Where are you?

518
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,900
Haarlemmstraat, 74.

519
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,100
Apartment C.

520
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,700
Apartment C.
It can't wait...

521
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,800
about 15 minutes, can it?

522
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,200
No. Now.

523
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,500
Hey, will you stop that?

524
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,600
Listen, what about tomorrow?

525
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,100
Not here.

526
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,600
Where?

527
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:36,200
Uh... I don't know.
Anywhere.

528
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,900
The old market.

529
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,700
Doll's House.

530
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,465
Now, listen.
Get Pacco talking, O.K.?

531
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,100
Twist him around
them little pins of yours...

532
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,900
and keep him spinning.

533
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,400
Uh... just like you do with me.

534
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,765
Oh!

535
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,400
Don't let it get cold.

536
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,265
Hello, Garvin.

537
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,050
Are you buying or selling?

538
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,800
I'm giving it away, actually.

539
00:45:56,835 --> 00:45:58,265
Like you'd have to.

540
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,800
Garvin, that car's
been over there...

541
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,300
for 10 minutes
with its engine running.

542
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,800
Garvin.

543
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,400
Good morning.

544
00:47:11,435 --> 00:47:13,500
Good morning.

545
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,800
Ha ha ha!

546
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,700
Mmm.

547
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,100
I say, Garvin, that was
a bloody close shave.

548
00:47:29,135 --> 00:47:30,400
If you'd been late...

549
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,100
Somebody had to
take a chance...

550
00:47:32,135 --> 00:47:33,565
and I'm chicken.

551
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,200
Well, that's
well-known, isn't it?

552
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,400
Oh!

553
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,900
Mmm. Mmm.

554
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,400
Mmm. Mmm.

555
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,700
Mmm.

556
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,800
Ahh!

557
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,700
Faith, hope, and charity.

558
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,200
The wages of sin.

559
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,700
At least we're
keeping her busy.

560
00:48:35,735 --> 00:48:37,600
But you must decide
what to do...

561
00:48:37,635 --> 00:48:38,965
about Pacco's girl Nicole.

562
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,750
What have I done
to deserve this?

563
00:48:40,785 --> 00:48:42,500
Everyone in my organization...

564
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,900
behaves as if she was
Mata Hari or something.

565
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,900
He asks for instructions.

566
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,100
It's too expensive.

567
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,100
Is he making
the decisions now?

568
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,500
No, Clara.

569
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,800
No.

570
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,365
You know, McWhirter...

571
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,200
that woman has no sense
of the value of human life.

572
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,700
Buon giorno, Fidello.

573
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,000
Good morning.

574
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,400
Arrivederci.

575
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,300
McWhirter...

576
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,300
take a letter to Pacco.

577
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,600
My dear Pacco...

578
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:43,200
the few of us
who are responsible...

579
00:49:43,235 --> 00:49:46,000
for the lives of so many...

580
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,100
bear a very heavy burden.

581
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,500
No. Carry a great weight.

582
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,665
A good general weeps...

583
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:59,200
when he is forced to send
his troops into action...

584
00:49:59,235 --> 00:50:03,500
and the tears
of the widows...

585
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,665
Widows and orphans.

586
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:09,200
And the tears
of the widows and orphans...

587
00:50:09,235 --> 00:50:11,500
are his tears too.

588
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,200
Ohh.

589
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,700
Lost the thread.

590
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,700
- Nicole.
- Oh, yeah.

591
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,700
Send a cable.
Dear Pacco...

592
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,400
if the girl is alive
tomorrow night, you won't be.

593
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,000
That's better,
and cheaper too.

594
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,400
A bit crude.

595
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,900
Let's start again.

596
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,700
Pacco will understand.

597
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,200
Hmm. I suppose so.

598
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,900
He reads the comic strips.

599
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,300
No!

600
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,200
Aah!

601
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,700
Let me see.

602
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,200
It hurts.

603
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,200
Tell Willie...

604
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,800
Gabriel.

605
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,200
Oh.

606
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,665
Ah!

607
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,400
Willie... it's Gabriel.

608
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,665
So far, so good.

609
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,665
But no sign of Modesty.

610
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,965
I told her it would be 10:00.

611
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,900
She's not the sort
who can resist temptation.

612
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,200
You should know.

613
00:56:07,235 --> 00:56:08,700
Hmm.

614
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:15,300
Are you afraid she'd
steal those empty boxes?

615
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,800
Heh heh heh!

616
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,100
Do you ski?

617
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,700
No.

618
00:56:57,735 --> 00:56:59,467
Do you?

619
00:56:59,502 --> 00:57:01,200
No.

620
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,200
G- control.
Bravo Fox Trot.

621
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,200
G- control.
Bravo Fox Trot.

622
00:57:10,235 --> 00:57:13,000
G- control
receiving you.

623
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,700
We are now
in jet-stream conditions...

624
00:57:15,735 --> 00:57:17,465
at 50,000 feet.

625
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,100
Estimate Beirut
in 21/2 hours' time.

626
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,150
The pilot's got
a charming voice.

627
00:57:27,185 --> 00:57:29,700
About 35, I should say,
wouldn't you?

628
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,000
Any dependents?

629
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,600
Just a wee minute.

630
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,400
Oh, here we are.

631
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,400
Squadron leader Latham
of Woking, Surrey.

632
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:44,565
Hmm!

633
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,600
I very much fear
he is married...

634
00:57:46,635 --> 00:57:48,200
with two bairns,
6 and 9.

635
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,700
I was afraid of that.

636
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,900
Strauss!

637
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,100
- Yes, sir.
- Is rocket base Ladino ready?

638
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,200
- Standing by, sir.
- Good.

639
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,700
Yes?

640
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,265
Rocket base Ladino...

641
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,600
estimates 2 minutes, 23 seconds.

642
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,600
Thank you.

643
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,600
Oh, McWhirter...

644
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:22,600
the moment I always dread
in these cases...

645
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,800
To light the fuse...

646
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,200
to push the button...

647
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
to squeeze the trigger.

648
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,700
Such exquisite torture.

649
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,700
We're all relying on you, sir.

650
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,200
Yes, torture.

651
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,800
Strauss!

652
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,365
Sir.

653
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,800
Tell Ladino rocket base...

654
00:58:48,835 --> 00:58:50,100
go!

655
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,800
Jawohl, sir.

656
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:54,300
Ha ha ha!

657
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,700
Rocket base Ladino,
all systems go.

658
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,100
Do you skate?

659
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,300
Skate?

660
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,900
When I was a child...

661
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
my parents took me
tobogganing.

662
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,400
Oh!

663
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:23,900
Ah.

664
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,100
Hello?

665
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,600
Hello?

666
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,400
Do you hear me?

667
00:59:28,435 --> 00:59:29,700
Hello?

668
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,000
Dulce et decorum
est pro patria mori.

669
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,900
A father of two children...

670
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,400
probably with a split-level
house in Woking...

671
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,700
and a rubber plant
in the lounge.

672
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:57,900
No.

673
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,500
Why can't they be bachelors?

674
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,200
I'll get that bloody friar
for playing scales...

675
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:05,165
in the middle of the night.

676
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,200
Sets my Presbyterian
teeth on edge.

677
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,700
Religious intolerance,
McWhirter.

678
01:00:10,735 --> 01:00:12,665
Shouldn't we mourn them...

679
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:15,300
regardless of race
or color or creed?

680
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,700
Rocket base Ladino reports
seeing four parachutes open.

681
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,200
How marvelous! Wonderful!

682
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,100
Why four?

683
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,000
Those planes carry four.

684
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:31,600
Well, I didn't know that.

685
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,300
Tell the friar
to play a te deum.

686
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,600
For what shall
he give thanks for?

687
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,000
For me, of course!

688
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,800
Tyboria.

689
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:54,800
Lisbon, Catania, Beirut.

690
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,200
Well, I couldn't help it.

691
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,200
Tell me...

692
01:01:03,235 --> 01:01:04,665
Hmm?

693
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,165
When did you discover...

694
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,700
that the, uh,
plane was a blind?

695
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:10,467
Did it work?

696
01:01:10,502 --> 01:01:12,165
Yes, it did.

697
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,000
They swallowed the bait...

698
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,600
and shot down the plane.

699
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:28,000
I'm afraid
it's just a little warm.

700
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:58,400
I've been watching you,
so I trust you.

701
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,000
Where are you going?

702
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:39,500
Bed.

703
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:56,400
Modesty, I...

704
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,100
I don't...

705
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,900
I mean...

706
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,600
I can't.

707
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,800
Thank you, Weng.
How is everything?

708
01:03:30,835 --> 01:03:32,400
All circuits are go-go.

709
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,000
Very well, miss, thank you.

710
01:03:34,035 --> 01:03:35,500
Sweet. Sweet, isn't he?

711
01:03:35,535 --> 01:03:36,800
Yeah.

712
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,800
"Sorry, darling. "

713
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,000
Modesty.

714
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:08,600
"Sorry, darling,"
it says here.

715
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,900
"You broke your part
of the bargain.

716
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,200
"I now consider
myself a free agent.

717
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:14,500
Modesty. "

718
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,800
She, uh...
she knows, sir.

719
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:29,500
She knows the diamonds
are on the Tyboria.

720
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,100
Well, we fooled Gabriel...

721
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,900
and now we're lumbered
with Modesty Blaise.

722
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,500
Heaven protect my pension.

723
01:04:36,535 --> 01:04:38,000
Hello.

724
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:54,500
- Hey.
- Ah.

725
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,800
We wasted a million
on that wretched rocket.

726
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:14,000
One has to do
what is expected of one.

727
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,265
Now we have
the advantage of surprise.

728
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:19,300
They think we're searching
the Alps for wreckage...

729
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,800
but the diamonds are here...

730
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,300
in the strongroom...

731
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,100
concealed in a crate
of porcelain...

732
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,400
Crown Derby to be exact.

733
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,400
Sir, from the Tyboria.

734
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,600
From the Tyboria?

735
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,365
Tyboria, Tyboria.

736
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:37,400
"Tyboria departed
1520 hours Lisbon. Stop.

737
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,800
"Modesty Blaise
and Willie Garvin...

738
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:44,500
overflew 1600 hours
approx. Stop. "

739
01:05:44,535 --> 01:05:46,100
Silly dilettante.

740
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:55,100
I figure it this way, princess.

741
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,400
Gabriel's got it figured...

742
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:03,300
so I figure all we got to do...

743
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,500
is, uh, stay close to Gabriel.

744
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,200
Leave the figuring to me,
Willie.

745
01:06:08,235 --> 01:06:10,000
You might hurt yourself.

746
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:32,690
Ah.

747
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:43,290
Oleg.

748
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:48,390
Can it be that this egg
is fertilized?

749
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:53,755
I thought so.

750
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:55,090
Take it away, Enrico.

751
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:56,590
You have it, McWhirter.

752
01:06:56,690 --> 01:06:59,690
I'm sure you'd hate
to see it wasted.

753
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:11,690
Fothergill calling.
Fothergill calling.

754
01:07:11,725 --> 01:07:13,455
Ugh.

755
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:17,390
Fothergill calling.
Fothergill calling.

756
01:07:17,425 --> 01:07:19,655
What is that woman
up to now?

757
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:21,890
The diving tests
for Basilio and Borg.

758
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:23,490
Yes, Mrs. Fothergill?

759
01:07:23,525 --> 01:07:24,690
Basilio's back.

760
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:27,890
He is carrying on
like a baby, but he's back.

761
01:07:27,925 --> 01:07:29,390
And Borg?

762
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:32,690
He is down now.

763
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:36,990
Ah.

764
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:38,190
Hmm.

765
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:39,990
That one.

766
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:41,890
No, no. That one.

767
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:45,590
Oh, decisions, decisions.

768
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:46,890
Both!

769
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:52,990
Borg has a weak heart...

770
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:56,255
Shh! I can't bear
to hear them screaming.

771
01:07:56,290 --> 01:07:59,790
It's a proved fact that
lobsters feel no pain.

772
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:01,790
It's just wind escaping.

773
01:08:01,825 --> 01:08:03,690
Don't be revolting.

774
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:31,690
Mmm.

775
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:44,890
Fothergill calling.

776
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:47,090
Yes, Mrs. Fothergill?

777
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:49,390
Borg has failed.

778
01:08:52,690 --> 01:08:54,290
Ahem.

779
01:08:56,290 --> 01:08:58,990
How can I eat lobster...

780
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:02,290
when the lobsters
are eating Borg?

781
01:09:02,325 --> 01:09:04,790
I shall never forgive myself.

782
01:09:04,825 --> 01:09:06,790
Take it away, Enrico.

783
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:16,790
We can't do it without Borg.

784
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:18,790
Well, uh, there are...

785
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:21,290
two other men
that I would trust...

786
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:23,290
to crack that strongroom.

787
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:25,590
Yourself, of course.

788
01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:27,090
Myself...

789
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:31,090
and Willie Garvin.

790
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:47,690
Here. We now have
been through...

791
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:49,990
some scrapes together,
have we?

792
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:52,590
Funny how we always
survived, isn't it?

793
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:54,740
Survived... each other?

794
01:09:54,775 --> 01:09:56,790
Well, we shared the fights.

795
01:09:56,890 --> 01:09:58,790
But never shared the nights.

796
01:09:58,825 --> 01:10:00,690
Perhaps we should have.

797
01:10:00,725 --> 01:10:02,190
We could have.

798
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:06,390
# At Covent Garden,
il trovatore #

799
01:10:06,490 --> 01:10:08,690
# We were shot at
in the stalls #

800
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:11,290
# They all believed
it was in the story #

801
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:13,290
# And we took nine
curtain calls #

802
01:10:13,390 --> 01:10:15,290
Perhaps eight would
have been enough.

803
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:16,790
# We've shared the thrills #

804
01:10:16,890 --> 01:10:18,690
# We've even
shared the kills #

805
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:20,490
# But such a perfect pair #

806
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:22,290
# Should surely
share a bedroom #

807
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:23,990
You know,
it's cheaper too.

808
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:25,190
It ain't.

809
01:10:25,290 --> 01:10:27,990
# The other summer in Arizona #

810
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:29,790
# I was sentenced to the chair #

811
01:10:29,890 --> 01:10:32,490
# But they didn't realize
I knew the owner #

812
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:34,890
# Of the power station there #

813
01:10:34,990 --> 01:10:40,390
# We've bombed and mined
but never intertwined #

814
01:10:40,425 --> 01:10:41,790
# We were crazy #

815
01:10:41,890 --> 01:10:43,055
You know.

816
01:10:43,090 --> 01:10:44,690
# I was lazy #

817
01:10:44,725 --> 01:10:45,855
I know.

818
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:49,190
# Yes, we should've,
and we could've #

819
01:10:49,290 --> 01:10:51,290
# Perhaps we can #

820
01:10:54,190 --> 01:10:56,390
If Gabriel doesn't
attack us soon...

821
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:58,455
we'll have to have lunch.

822
01:10:58,490 --> 01:11:01,090
That's what you
really want, isn't it?

823
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:03,890
Always the grubstakes.

824
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:05,290
Hello.

825
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:41,590
Here! That constitutes
very flash behavior.

826
01:11:41,625 --> 01:11:42,990
Mm-hmm.

827
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:44,690
Should we have a laugh?

828
01:11:44,725 --> 01:11:46,290
We're laughing.

829
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:48,790
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

830
01:12:23,290 --> 01:12:25,540
Need a smoke, any rate.

831
01:12:25,575 --> 01:12:27,790
They're set for 10 minutes.

832
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:29,290
Mmm.

833
01:12:31,690 --> 01:12:33,490
Oh, no. Not you!

834
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:53,955
Mmm.

835
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:57,590
How the devil did you
get a passport, Garvin?

836
01:12:57,690 --> 01:12:59,190
Just because
I'm working-class?

837
01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:00,890
Lower-class
you mean, surely.

838
01:13:00,925 --> 01:13:02,490
Where are you taking us?

839
01:13:02,525 --> 01:13:03,590
London.

840
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:05,090
Paul, darling.

841
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:06,655
Jacquelyn, darling.

842
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:09,690
Let us go, and we'll
lead you to Gabriel.

843
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:11,290
We've played
the truth game.

844
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:13,090
Now we're going to
play consequences.

845
01:13:13,190 --> 01:13:14,490
Come along.

846
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:02,790
Willie, we've
got to be more conspicuous.

847
01:14:02,890 --> 01:14:04,790
Do you mean really flash?

848
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:09,490
Gabriel!

849
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:11,490
Gabriel!

850
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:14,590
Gabriel!

851
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:17,090
Gabriel!

852
01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:20,690
Gabriel!

853
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:23,490
Gabriel.

854
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:25,790
Gabriel!

855
01:14:25,825 --> 01:14:27,990
Gabriel.

856
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:31,790
Gabriel.

857
01:14:31,825 --> 01:14:32,890
Gabriel.

858
01:14:37,690 --> 01:14:38,990
Gabriel.

859
01:14:40,290 --> 01:14:43,390
I'm beginning to think
he doesn't want us.

860
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:49,790
Shall we give up?

861
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:53,290
Home to bed?
Why not?

862
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:55,290
Why not?

863
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:57,090
Why not?

864
01:14:57,190 --> 01:14:58,490
Why not?

865
01:14:58,590 --> 01:14:59,855
# Why not? #

866
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:01,190
Why not?

867
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:02,490
Why not?

868
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:04,390
# Why not? #

869
01:15:13,290 --> 01:15:16,390
Miss Blaise,
I prefer you blond...

870
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:18,190
as you are now.

871
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:20,290
Ha ha ha ha!

872
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:22,190
Who is it?

873
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:25,255
An admirer.

874
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:27,890
Weren't you
expecting me to call?

875
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:31,755
Ha.

876
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:34,290
You've taken your time.

877
01:15:34,325 --> 01:15:35,755
Where are you?

878
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:40,090
On the pretty little
white boat below your window.

879
01:15:40,125 --> 01:15:42,290
Ha ha ha ha!

880
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:45,890
It's not mine,
of course. Mamma's.

881
01:15:54,290 --> 01:15:56,690
Much better.

882
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:59,790
I offer you a flag of truce...

883
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:01,790
and a delicious breakfast.

884
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:02,990
Hmm.

885
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:05,790
If you have
a good champagne.

886
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:07,190
Excellent.

887
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:09,790
I suppose you'll
want to change.

888
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:12,790
I'll send my launch for you
in half an hour.

889
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:14,290
An hour.

890
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:16,390
An hour?

891
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:19,390
An hour.

892
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:46,590
Eggs?

893
01:17:46,690 --> 01:17:48,090
Not Dutch.

894
01:17:50,890 --> 01:17:52,290
Everything.

895
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:13,090
To Modesty Blaise.

896
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:14,590
Gabriel.

897
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:21,190
You know,
it's been a long time.

898
01:18:26,190 --> 01:18:29,590
1958.

899
01:18:29,690 --> 01:18:31,090
Mmm.

900
01:18:31,190 --> 01:18:34,090
Very well, Oleg.
You can leave us.

901
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:42,390
You know...

902
01:18:42,490 --> 01:18:44,490
I think I prefer you...

903
01:18:44,525 --> 01:18:46,090
dark.

904
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:50,190
As you like.

905
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:51,790
Ha.

906
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:55,890
The royal box at Ascot...

907
01:18:55,990 --> 01:18:57,590
picking pockets.

908
01:18:57,690 --> 01:19:00,590
One has to start
somewhere, you know.

909
01:19:00,690 --> 01:19:02,090
Mmm.

910
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:04,190
Your first mistake.

911
01:19:04,225 --> 01:19:05,490
My last.

912
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:08,690
You really are very beautiful.

913
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:11,990
I haven't been dead
for two years.

914
01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:14,490
Very good for one's image.

915
01:19:14,525 --> 01:19:15,890
Mmm.

916
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:18,990
The payroll of
the Turkish fleet...

917
01:19:19,025 --> 01:19:20,590
Ah... marvelous.

918
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:23,290
Your Brussels job...
superb.

919
01:19:23,390 --> 01:19:26,090
Two Botticellis
and one Grandma Moses.

920
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:28,190
One Botticelli...

921
01:19:28,290 --> 01:19:30,990
two Grandma Moses.

922
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:33,190
We really should be
partners, you know.

923
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:35,890
Ah. If I gave the orders.

924
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:38,190
Suffragette.

925
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:40,090
Psychopath.

926
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:43,490
We are under a flag of truce,
remember?

927
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:48,190
Now, then,
about the diamonds.

928
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:50,990
Oh. About breakfast.

929
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:57,690
I have a plan.

930
01:19:57,790 --> 01:19:59,890
I have Willie Garvin.

931
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:03,190
And you're also working
for Her Majesty's government.

932
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:05,290
Tck tck tck tck.

933
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:07,490
Your second mistake.

934
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:10,190
Ha.

935
01:20:10,290 --> 01:20:12,790
I get my information
my own way.

936
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:14,890
Naturally.

937
01:20:16,790 --> 01:20:19,190
Which is why
we should be partners.

938
01:20:20,590 --> 01:20:24,390
And, as partners,
you can trust me.

939
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:32,490
Not so hard, Mrs. Fothergill,
not so hard.

940
01:21:07,390 --> 01:21:09,490
Lady. Lady.

941
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:39,990
Ah, Miss Blaise.

942
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:43,290
How are you feeling?

943
01:21:45,690 --> 01:21:47,190
Do sit down.

944
01:21:47,225 --> 01:21:48,690
Headache?

945
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:51,790
I'm so sorry.

946
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:01,790
May I present Miss World.

947
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:06,940
I'm sorry, princess.

948
01:22:06,975 --> 01:22:08,732
I was on the job.

949
01:22:08,767 --> 01:22:10,490
Working overtime.

950
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:15,690
Where are you taking me?

951
01:22:15,790 --> 01:22:17,690
You're on board the Andronicus...

952
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:19,790
bound from Bizerte
to Dubrovnik...

953
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:23,490
with a cargo of fruit
and nuts.

954
01:22:23,525 --> 01:22:24,890
He's a fruit merchant, see.

955
01:22:24,925 --> 01:22:26,155
He is a nut.

956
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:28,490
That's enough of that.

957
01:22:28,590 --> 01:22:31,590
Your Mr. Garvin
is going to help us.

958
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:33,090
Otherwise...

959
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:34,590
I really can't say it.

960
01:22:34,690 --> 01:22:36,090
It's just pure melodrama.

961
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:38,590
I'm not fussy.
I will say it for you.

962
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:40,090
Oh, please, no.

963
01:22:40,190 --> 01:22:43,090
If he doesn't,
you will be killed.

964
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:45,990
Who's the bird
with the beady eyes?

965
01:22:54,590 --> 01:22:58,190
You've got three hours
to master the job.

966
01:22:58,225 --> 01:23:00,690
Rehearsals start in five minutes.

967
01:23:00,725 --> 01:23:02,590
Search her thoroughly.

968
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:17,890
Your clothes have been searched.
Give me your watch.

969
01:23:19,790 --> 01:23:21,690
All right.
Take that off.

970
01:23:25,190 --> 01:23:26,590
There's your belt back...

971
01:23:26,690 --> 01:23:28,590
Pretty but harmless.

972
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:51,090
That's all very well...

973
01:23:51,190 --> 01:23:53,590
but woolen knickers
to the knees...

974
01:23:53,690 --> 01:23:55,990
are better for your health.

975
01:24:04,890 --> 01:24:06,790
Ah.

976
01:24:08,190 --> 01:24:10,540
Scorpio.

977
01:24:10,575 --> 01:24:12,855
Mm-hmm.

978
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:15,690
There is a sting in my tail.

979
01:24:28,490 --> 01:24:30,490
Enrico, have those vetted.

980
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:34,590
Hey, love. Thanks.

981
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:41,590
We'll keep her little arsenal.

982
01:24:41,690 --> 01:24:43,590
She can have those back.

983
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:56,890
Ha ha ha ha!

984
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:02,690
Oh, no!

985
01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:07,090
Yes! Everything's
delightfully normal...

986
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:09,190
The rattle of coffee cups...

987
01:25:09,225 --> 01:25:11,190
the tinkle of music.

988
01:25:14,690 --> 01:25:16,155
No sign of Modesty.

989
01:25:16,190 --> 01:25:17,690
Then she's somewhere below.

990
01:25:17,725 --> 01:25:19,457
Found that registration?

991
01:25:19,492 --> 01:25:21,155
The owner is a Greek.

992
01:25:21,190 --> 01:25:22,690
Inevitably.
What's his name?

993
01:25:22,725 --> 01:25:24,155
Callimanedis.

994
01:25:24,190 --> 01:25:26,090
And flying
the Panamanian flag...

995
01:25:26,190 --> 01:25:27,890
so that we can't board her.

996
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:29,890
Uh, take a look at that chap...

997
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:32,090
with the bald head,
pouring out the coffee.

998
01:25:33,490 --> 01:25:34,955
Gabriel?

999
01:25:34,990 --> 01:25:36,590
Most probably.

1000
01:25:36,690 --> 01:25:38,590
Hello.

1001
01:25:38,690 --> 01:25:40,090
Ah!

1002
01:25:40,190 --> 01:25:41,590
The Tyboria.

1003
01:25:41,690 --> 01:25:43,090
Right on time.

1004
01:25:43,190 --> 01:25:44,590
The plot thickens.

1005
01:25:44,690 --> 01:25:46,590
Cigarette?

1006
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:48,290
We better get cracking.

1007
01:26:10,190 --> 01:26:11,655
Gabriel's design?

1008
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:13,690
He's building another one
for outer space...

1009
01:26:13,725 --> 01:26:15,590
- Just in case.
- Ready?

1010
01:26:15,690 --> 01:26:16,990
Ready!

1011
01:26:21,190 --> 01:26:22,490
Go!

1012
01:26:58,890 --> 01:27:02,655
Full many a gem
of purest ray serene...

1013
01:27:02,690 --> 01:27:07,390
the dark, unfathomed caves
of an ocean bear.

1014
01:27:32,690 --> 01:27:34,090
Your antisonic device?

1015
01:27:34,190 --> 01:27:35,390
Japowski.

1016
01:27:35,490 --> 01:27:36,890
The best.

1017
01:27:36,990 --> 01:27:38,390
Your guidance system?

1018
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:39,590
Burroughs...

1019
01:27:39,690 --> 01:27:41,590
concealed in a crate of jade.

1020
01:27:41,690 --> 01:27:43,090
Shipped by you.

1021
01:27:43,190 --> 01:27:45,290
Now transmitting
to the submarine capsule.

1022
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:49,690
They should be in touch with
the Tyboria just about now.

1023
01:28:00,590 --> 01:28:03,390
They should be
dropping the pilot.

1024
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:07,990
Our first contact is magnetic.

1025
01:28:08,090 --> 01:28:09,490
Not strong enough.

1026
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:11,990
It will hold them till
they drop the pilot.

1027
01:28:12,090 --> 01:28:13,490
The pilot boat.

1028
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:14,990
The pilot boat.

1029
01:28:32,790 --> 01:28:34,790
The Jacob's Ladder is down.

1030
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:40,090
In my opinion...

1031
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:41,990
you cut this possibly too fine.

1032
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:43,907
I've given them the tools.

1033
01:28:43,942 --> 01:28:45,790
They must finish the job.

1034
01:29:05,690 --> 01:29:07,190
Their screw's turning.

1035
01:29:09,190 --> 01:29:10,690
How's your drink?

1036
01:29:10,725 --> 01:29:12,190
How's Willie?

1037
01:29:36,590 --> 01:29:38,055
Ah.

1038
01:29:38,090 --> 01:29:39,890
I'm in, darling.

1039
01:29:41,590 --> 01:29:44,390
I just hope
it's the right ship.

1040
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:48,090
He's in the alleyway
between the water tanks.

1041
01:29:48,125 --> 01:29:49,590
How is the timing?

1042
01:29:49,690 --> 01:29:50,890
Exact!

1043
01:30:05,090 --> 01:30:06,590
Remember your promise.

1044
01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:08,090
When we get home.

1045
01:30:08,190 --> 01:30:10,590
No. Now, you said, at sea...

1046
01:30:10,690 --> 01:30:12,590
a death on the ocean wave.

1047
01:30:12,690 --> 01:30:14,590
C'est plus amusante
comme ca, non?

1048
01:30:14,690 --> 01:30:16,790
You must learn to
sip your pleasures...

1049
01:30:16,825 --> 01:30:18,255
Mrs. Fothergill.

1050
01:30:18,290 --> 01:30:21,290
Don't gulp them
all down at one go!

1051
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:29,590
Pronto!

1052
01:30:32,090 --> 01:30:33,990
Hello, Captain.

1053
01:30:34,090 --> 01:30:35,990
There's a small cargo ship...
the Andronicus...

1054
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:38,655
flying an Iberian flag.

1055
01:30:38,690 --> 01:30:41,190
She's been standing off a mile
from us on a parallel course.

1056
01:30:41,225 --> 01:30:42,657
Andronicus?

1057
01:30:42,692 --> 01:30:44,055
Andronicus?

1058
01:30:44,090 --> 01:30:47,055
Captain, get the covers
off the guns...

1059
01:30:47,090 --> 01:30:50,290
and, Captain, check on
that strongroom again.

1060
01:31:33,090 --> 01:31:34,590
"Fragile.

1061
01:31:34,625 --> 01:31:36,357
Porcelain. "

1062
01:31:36,392 --> 01:31:38,055
Ah, yes.

1063
01:31:38,090 --> 01:31:40,090
All present and correct, intact.

1064
01:31:41,590 --> 01:31:43,090
What's that?

1065
01:31:47,590 --> 01:31:49,090
Looks like a fish.

1066
01:31:57,090 --> 01:31:58,555
I'm an idiot!

1067
01:31:58,590 --> 01:32:00,555
They're not on that yacht.

1068
01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:03,090
They're on that
bloody cargo boat.

1069
01:33:27,090 --> 01:33:29,890
I'm not a desiccated
calculating machine...

1070
01:33:29,925 --> 01:33:31,990
like you, McWhirter.

1071
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:36,290
Nor yet a roaring psychopath...

1072
01:33:36,325 --> 01:33:38,490
like you, dear lady.

1073
01:33:41,790 --> 01:33:44,390
I am the villain
of the piece...

1074
01:33:44,490 --> 01:33:47,390
and I have to
condemn you to death.

1075
01:33:47,490 --> 01:33:49,490
But I am the heroine.

1076
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:51,490
Don't I get away?

1077
01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:53,090
Perhaps.

1078
01:33:57,890 --> 01:33:59,790
Convey Mr. Garvin
to the tower.

1079
01:34:01,390 --> 01:34:03,290
And take Modesty
to the cell...

1080
01:34:03,390 --> 01:34:05,290
which I have prepared for her.

1081
01:36:08,590 --> 01:36:10,090
Yes...

1082
01:36:12,090 --> 01:36:14,590
this is the way out.

1083
01:36:17,090 --> 01:36:18,555
Hmm.

1084
01:36:18,590 --> 01:36:20,090
On what terms?

1085
01:36:20,125 --> 01:36:22,055
Mine.

1086
01:36:22,090 --> 01:36:23,690
My island...

1087
01:36:23,790 --> 01:36:25,190
my kingdom.

1088
01:36:26,890 --> 01:36:28,290
Join me, Modesty.

1089
01:36:28,390 --> 01:36:30,290
We're a match for each other.

1090
01:36:30,390 --> 01:36:33,390
To destroy you would be
like destroying myself...

1091
01:36:33,425 --> 01:36:36,990
but together,
we could inherit the earth.

1092
01:36:38,890 --> 01:36:41,155
The terms.

1093
01:36:41,190 --> 01:36:43,090
We share the diamonds...

1094
01:36:43,125 --> 01:36:44,990
and you eliminate Garvin.

1095
01:36:48,990 --> 01:36:51,990
I'll eliminate Mrs. Fothergill.

1096
01:36:55,290 --> 01:36:56,490
No.

1097
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:03,690
McWhirter,
tell Mrs. Fothergill...

1098
01:37:03,790 --> 01:37:06,690
to meet me on the Angel Terrace
in one hour's time.

1099
01:37:06,790 --> 01:37:09,590
You come too,
and bring your ledgers.

1100
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:38,990
Aah!

1101
01:37:49,790 --> 01:37:51,190
You're nice.

1102
01:37:52,790 --> 01:37:55,190
I'm sorry we had to stop.

1103
01:39:40,890 --> 01:39:42,090
Aah!

1104
01:40:07,490 --> 01:40:10,590
Mmm.

1105
01:43:55,790 --> 01:43:58,090
Ha ha ha ha!

1106
01:44:22,290 --> 01:44:23,890
Ha ha ha!

1107
01:44:23,925 --> 01:44:25,490
Splat!

1108
01:45:12,090 --> 01:45:14,190
Ha ha ha ha!

1109
01:46:57,990 --> 01:47:00,190
Princess!

1110
01:47:00,290 --> 01:47:02,290
Kick the bucket!

1111
01:47:06,490 --> 01:47:08,290
Aah!

1112
01:48:00,690 --> 01:48:02,590
Chilean pesos
are no use in Calcutta.

1113
01:48:02,690 --> 01:48:05,190
We shall have to use
Vladivostok.

1114
01:48:05,290 --> 01:48:08,790
It would mean a loss
of three mil...

1115
01:48:08,825 --> 01:48:11,190
Three million...

1116
01:48:11,290 --> 01:48:13,190
which would be
quite unnecessary.

1117
01:48:13,290 --> 01:48:15,890
I entirely agree.

1118
01:48:24,190 --> 01:48:25,790
Callimanedis sent us a bill...

1119
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:27,690
for dilapidations to his yacht.

1120
01:48:27,790 --> 01:48:29,190
Ignore it.

1121
01:48:29,290 --> 01:48:31,690
What does he expect
for $10,000?

1122
01:48:31,790 --> 01:48:34,190
What is that woman up to?

1123
01:48:47,290 --> 01:48:48,590
Ha ha ha!

1124
01:48:48,690 --> 01:48:51,190
Basilio, Oleg, Strauss!

1125
01:48:51,290 --> 01:48:53,190
Garvin and Blaise have escaped!

1126
01:48:55,790 --> 01:48:58,090
The diamonds.

1127
01:49:03,790 --> 01:49:05,190
Come on, you idiot!

1128
01:49:05,290 --> 01:49:07,090
After you, sir.

1129
01:50:23,290 --> 01:50:24,490
We've had it, princess!

1130
01:50:24,590 --> 01:50:26,190
The moment of truth!

1131
01:50:28,090 --> 01:50:30,190
Yeah! This is it.

1132
01:50:30,290 --> 01:50:32,690
Been nice working
with you, pea.

1133
01:50:32,790 --> 01:50:35,690
You know, Willie,
we should have.

1134
01:50:35,790 --> 01:50:37,690
Yeah, I suppose we should.

1135
01:50:37,790 --> 01:50:39,690
I don't know, though.

1136
01:50:39,790 --> 01:50:41,390
What?

1137
01:50:43,790 --> 01:50:46,190
Well, I mean...

1138
01:50:46,290 --> 01:50:49,690
it's sort of less common
this way, isn't it?

1139
01:50:49,790 --> 01:50:52,690
Here. Give us a kiss,
princess.

1140
01:50:53,990 --> 01:50:57,290
Modesty Blaise!

1141
01:50:57,325 --> 01:51:00,590
Look, Willie!

1142
01:51:03,490 --> 01:51:07,990
Modesty Blaise!

1143
01:51:16,890 --> 01:51:20,090
Here comes the sheik now.
His banner's flying.

1144
01:51:20,190 --> 01:51:24,155
We've got Gabriel
on the run.

1145
01:51:24,190 --> 01:51:27,990
# We will be lovebirds
and give up spying #

1146
01:51:28,090 --> 01:51:31,590
# When this battle
has been won #

1147
01:51:31,690 --> 01:51:33,990
Modesty Blaise!

1148
01:51:38,190 --> 01:51:40,855
# Just you and me #

1149
01:51:40,890 --> 01:51:44,490
# A cottage by the sea #

1150
01:51:44,590 --> 01:51:48,090
# With roses around the door #

1151
01:51:48,125 --> 01:51:51,590
# And babies
on the floor, dear #

1152
01:51:58,090 --> 01:52:00,690
# We'll take a dream boat #

1153
01:52:00,790 --> 01:52:02,990
# And sail away now #

1154
01:52:03,090 --> 01:52:06,990
# To the land
of sweet romance #

1155
01:52:07,090 --> 01:52:11,490
# Just me and you,
a quiet place #

1156
01:52:11,590 --> 01:52:16,690
Modesty Blaise!

1157
01:52:22,490 --> 01:52:26,590
# We'll have
a donkey in the stable #

1158
01:52:26,690 --> 01:52:30,490
# For peaceful donkey rides #

1159
01:52:30,590 --> 01:52:34,190
# I light the candles
on the table #

1160
01:52:34,290 --> 01:52:37,690
# By a cozy fireside #

1161
01:52:37,790 --> 01:52:41,490
# Just you and I... #

1162
01:52:45,390 --> 01:52:47,690
Stop wasting it!

1163
01:52:50,790 --> 01:52:52,690
Get down there.
Go on.

1164
01:53:06,290 --> 01:53:09,755
# And on the sand #

1165
01:53:09,790 --> 01:53:13,690
# We'll wander hand in hand #

1166
01:53:22,890 --> 01:53:24,190
# We will get married #

1167
01:53:24,290 --> 01:53:25,355
Mm-hmm.

1168
01:53:25,390 --> 01:53:26,690
# In the chapel #

1169
01:53:26,790 --> 01:53:30,490
# You'll give me
a wedding ring #

1170
01:53:39,490 --> 01:53:45,390
# At eventide,
we'll wander side by side #

1171
01:53:48,590 --> 01:53:52,190
# All alone now #

1172
01:53:52,290 --> 01:53:57,155
# On our own now #

1173
01:53:57,190 --> 01:54:01,890
# Yes, we should do,
and we could do #

1174
01:54:01,990 --> 01:54:04,590
# Now we can #

1175
01:54:22,790 --> 01:54:24,190
Put it down.

1176
01:54:24,290 --> 01:54:25,690
Don't point.

1177
01:54:25,790 --> 01:54:27,290
It's rude.

1178
01:55:06,290 --> 01:55:07,790
Tarrant speaking.

1179
01:55:07,825 --> 01:55:09,255
Tarrant?

1180
01:55:09,290 --> 01:55:11,690
Minister?
Minister, we've done it.

1181
01:55:11,790 --> 01:55:13,690
Mission accomplished.

1182
01:55:13,790 --> 01:55:17,390
- Well done.
- Thank you, sir.

1183
01:55:29,290 --> 01:55:31,190
Hmm.

1184
01:55:33,790 --> 01:55:35,190
Sir.

1185
01:56:49,190 --> 01:56:51,090
# Gimme water #

1186
01:56:51,190 --> 01:56:52,590
# I want ice #

# Gimme water #

# Ice, man #

1189
01:56:55,690 --> 01:56:57,090
# Ice is nice #

1190
01:56:57,190 --> 01:56:58,590
Your third mistake.

1191
01:56:58,690 --> 01:57:00,890
# Ice is nice #

1192
01:57:00,990 --> 01:57:04,590
# Ice is nice #

1193
01:57:04,690 --> 01:57:08,490

1200
01:57:39,690 --> 01:57:41,090
Champagne.

Champagne.

1204
01:57:54,190 --> 01:57:56,790
No! No! No! No!

1205
01:57:58,690 --> 01:58:03,590
McWhirter, my God,
I thought you were mother.

1206
01:58:14,590 --> 01:58:16,055
Ahh.

1207
01:58:16,090 --> 01:58:19,090
What can I do for you,
my son?

1208
01:58:19,125 --> 01:58:21,357
Mmm. Nothing. Nothing.

1209
01:58:21,392 --> 01:58:23,590
You can ask for anything.

1210
01:58:23,690 --> 01:58:25,090
Anything?

1211
01:58:25,190 --> 01:58:26,590
Anything.

1212
01:58:29,690 --> 01:58:31,190
The diamonds.

1213
01:58:33,190 --> 01:58:34,590
Hmm?

1214
01:58:34,690 --> 01:58:36,590
Ha ha ha ha!
