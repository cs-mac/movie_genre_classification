1
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,930
Turn him over.

2
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,270
Oh, no!

3
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,180
"Do not drink wine nor strong drink...

4
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,480
"...thou nor thy sons with thee...

5
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,820
"...least ye shall die.

6
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,220
"Look not thou upon
the wine when it is red...

7
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,830
"...and when it bringeth his color
in the cup when it moveth itself aright.

8
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,730
"...at the last it biteth
like a serpent...

9
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,840
"...and stingeth like an adder."

10
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,170
Now, folks...

11
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,250
...that's from the Good Book...

12
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,010
...but in this town...

13
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,680
...it's five cents a glass.

14
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,420
Five cents a glass.

15
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,190
Does anyone really think
that is the price of a drink?!

16
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,600
The price of a drink let him decide...

17
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,430
...who has lost his courage and pride...

18
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,200
...who lies a grovelling
heap of clay not far removed...

19
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,660
All's quiet, sir.

20
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,830
Let's fall in.

21
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,440
Follow me.

22
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,860
I beg your pardon.

23
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,030
- I'm so sorry.
- Allow me, ma'am.

24
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,290
Thank you.

25
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,630
May I?

26
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,130
Thank you.

27
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,540
Hey, Thornton, wake up! Soldiers!

28
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,710
Look.

29
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,660
I don't care what you meant to do...

30
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,660
...I don't like what you did.

31
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,500
You inconvenienced this lady,
and made a fool of yourself...

32
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,570
...and this railroad.

33
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,850
Now, I want you to apologize to this...

34
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,840
Yes, may I help you?

35
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,920
If they move, kill them.

36
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,090
Is he with them?

37
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,100
He's there.

38
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,860
Hold your fire! Get down!

39
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,530
Wait till they come out.

40
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,030
I can nail him.

41
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,700
I said, wait!

42
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,210
What if they go out the back?

43
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,050
It's covered. You two-bit
redneck peckerwood.

44
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,380
Abe.

45
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,230
I solemnly promise...

46
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,410
...God helping me...

47
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,910
I solemnly promise, God helping me...

48
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,970
...to abstain from all
fermented malt liquors...

49
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,910
...including wine, beer and cider.

50
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,990
...to abstain from liquor,
wine, cider and beer.

51
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,780
People marching down the street.
They'll pass by the horses.

52
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,180
We'll join them.

53
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,680
The Temperance Union?!

54
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,690
They should have been told.

55
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:23,960
Told what?

56
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,190
How long can anybody in this
manure pile keep his mouth shut?

57
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:40,050
"Yes we gather at the river

58
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,480
"The beautiful, beautiful river.

59
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,820
"Gather with the saints at the river."

60
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,050
Rifles.

61
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,390
One...

62
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,500
...no, three!

63
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,670
Maybe more, there, on the roof.

64
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,170
Get down.

65
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,910
Son-of-a-bitch!

66
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,170
Bounty hunters?

67
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,240
Hell, I wouldn't know.

68
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,850
Buck with Abe.

69
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,580
I kill them now?

70
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,690
Hold them here as long as you can.

71
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,360
I'll hold them till hell freezes over
or you say different.

72
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,710
When I kick him out, blast him.

73
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,280
We'll run for it.

74
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,780
Give me that gun.

75
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,610
"Oh the beautiful river.

76
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,390
"Gather with the saints at the river

77
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,450
"That flows by the throne of God."

78
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,450
Set?

79
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,880
Let's go!

80
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,060
Good luck, boys!

81
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,590
They're blowing this town to hell!

82
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,940
You trash!

83
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,970
Now you just hush now.

84
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,920
Hey, they was playing
"Gather at the River."

85
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,260
You know that one?

86
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:19,590
Sing it!

87
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,760
"Shall we gather at the river

88
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,670
"Where bright angel feet have trod."

89
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:52,960
Hurry!

90
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,960
"River that flows by the throne of God."

91
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,930
Come on, you lazy bastard!

92
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,190
I'm coming!

93
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,770
They've cleared out, for chrissake!

94
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,370
Let's go, T.C.!

95
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,960
Let's go!

96
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,490
Take him!

97
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,090
He's mine!

98
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,930
He's mine!

99
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,680
He's mine!

100
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,670
I shot this one!
Look at the size of that hole!

101
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,780
You just dig out that bullet
and see if it ain't my.06!

102
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,280
You know I shot him.

103
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,360
You'd claim the whole thing,
wouldn't you?!

104
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,680
Daddy! Daddy!

105
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,460
Damn!

106
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,860
Damn, I can't get his money belt off!

107
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,030
You stupid damn fools!

108
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,470
Why did you shoot this employee
and let the others get away?

109
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,370
I didn't! My first shot
killed this man right here!

110
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,810
Liar!

111
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:00,980
He shot that employee while I dropped
this bandit and them others too.

112
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,310
I must've killed all three of them.

113
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,980
What were we doing up on that roof?!

114
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,380
Liar!

115
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,220
Black liar!

116
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,380
Don't talk like that to me.

117
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,550
I'm sorry.

118
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,230
Come on, T.C., help me get his boots.

119
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,900
I think this will do pretty good.

120
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,740
Next time, plan the massacre carefully,
or I'll start with you.

121
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:34,250
Why didn't you kill Pike
when you had the chance?

122
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,090
Hey, stop!

123
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,250
Stop!

124
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,860
Feathers flew like a turkey!

125
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,530
They shouldn't have run.
They shouldn't have run.

126
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,760
Say!

127
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:08,210
Well, how'd you like to kiss
my sister's black cat's ass?

128
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,230
It's better than a hog-killing!

129
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,060
Get them out of here!

130
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:38,410
We're holding you and your railroad
responsible for this carnage!

131
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,980
Innocent people are dead!

132
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,810
Women dying and hurt because
you used our town as a battlefield!

133
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,420
The railroad is going to pay
for our loss of blood!

134
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,920
We were trying to catch outlaws!

135
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,750
You lured them in here!

136
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:56,660
The railroad has been blabbing
about a big payload for weeks!

137
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,560
We represent the law!

138
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,120
Pike, is that you?

139
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,460
I can ride.

140
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,190
I can ride.

141
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,540
I can't see, but I can ride.

142
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,800
No!

143
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,530
I can't ride.

144
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,800
Finish it.

145
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,850
You boys want to move on,
or stay and give him a...

146
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,670
...decent burial?

147
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,070
He was a good man.

148
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,010
We should bury him.

149
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,520
He's dead!

150
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,010
With a lot of men to keep him company!

151
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,760
Too damn many!

152
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,930
I think the boys are right.

153
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,420
I'd like to say a few words
for the dear dead departed.

154
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,930
Maybe a few hymns'd be in order!

155
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,270
Followed by a church supper...

156
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,770
...with a choir!

157
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,110
You crazy bastards, both of you!

158
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,680
Bishop, Engstrom...

159
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,620
...the Gorch brothers!

160
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:07,700
Amounts to a total of $4,500
and you let them ride out on you!

161
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,130
When the money value
of the men you killed...

162
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:15,070
...less my commission adds up to $500!

163
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:19,310
Any one of those pelts would have
not only cleared you with the company...

164
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,410
...but have given you money
to raise hell with!

165
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,640
We'll do better next time!

166
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,470
We'll do anything you say, but we'd
appreciate liquor money tonight.

167
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:32,310
There won't be any tonight!
You go after them in ten minutes!

168
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,480
Get them! Get Pike and you'll be rich!

169
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,920
And if any one of you
tries to quit on me...

170
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,920
...I'll pay a bonus of $1,000...

171
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,490
...to the man that kills him!

172
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,500
Let's pack it up then!

173
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,950
- Why should I let you go with them?
- We've been over that.

174
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,020
You might join them again.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

175
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:15,630
What I like and what I need
are two different things. Listen.

176
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:19,530
I don't want to go back
to prison, never again.

177
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,670
But it's got to be my way!
But I need some good men!

178
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,570
You saw what happened
out there this morning!

179
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,340
You use what you have and see to it
that it doesn't happen again...

180
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,770
...or I'll see to it that you spend
the rest of your life behind bars.

181
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,770
Try to run, I'll be after you.

182
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,970
I gave my word.

183
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,980
We'll see what it's worth!

184
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,280
Six minutes.

185
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,480
Tell me...

186
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,280
...how's it feel...

187
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,150
...getting paid for it?

188
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:48,060
Getting paid to sit back and hire your
killings with the law's arms around you?

189
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,990
How's it feel to be so goddamn right?

190
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:51,890
Good.

191
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,400
You dirty son-of-a-bitch!

192
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,740
You've got 30 days to get Pike
or 30 days to get back to Yuma.

193
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,810
You're my Judas goat, Mr. Thornton.

194
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,310
I want all of them back here,
head down over a saddle.

195
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,250
Thirty days to get Pike
or 30 days back to Yuma.

196
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,440
I don't see nothing so
lindo about it.

197
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:38,270
Just looks like more of Texas to me.

198
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,940
You have no eyes.

199
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,810
Got a half hour of light. Let's go.

200
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,820
Hello, little fella.

201
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,540
- Them other fellas...
- They're not coming!

202
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,800
None of them?

203
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:21,210
- But I got horses and saddles for them.
- We'll need them, they won't.

204
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,980
About the sharing up.

205
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,990
It will be the same as always.

206
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:05,930
Me and Tector don't think that
he ought to get the same amount.

207
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,360
He's just starting out, and this is
our opening for a new territory.

208
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,560
That's right.

209
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:16,700
I figure a share to that old goat for
watching the horses is a share too much.

210
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,610
So, we decided...

211
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,500
...it ain't fair.

212
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:30,720
If you two don't like equal shares, why
the hell don't you just take all of it?

213
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,720
Why don't you answer me,
you damned yellow trash?!

214
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,450
Now, Pike, you know...

215
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:44,120
I don't know a damned thing except
I either lead this bunch or end it now.

216
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,140
We divide it up like you say.

217
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:00,040
Chick, chick, chick, chick,
chick, chick, chick.

218
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,330
Silver rings.

219
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,560
Silver rings, your butt!
Them's washers! Damn!

220
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,770
Bastards!

221
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,430
Washers!

222
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:36,850
We shot our way out of that town
for a dollar's worth of steel holes!

223
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,180
They set it up!

224
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:42,290
They? Who in the hell is "they"?!

225
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,520
"They"?!

226
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,960
"They" is just plain and fancy "they."

227
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,540
That's who "they" is.

228
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:59,700
Caught you, didn't they?
Tied a tin can to your tail!

229
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,700
Led you in and waltzed you out again!

230
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,610
Oh, my, what a bunch!

231
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,540
Big tough ones!

232
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:14,320
Here you are with a handful
of holes, a thumb up your ass...

233
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:18,060
...and a big grin to pass
the time of day with.

234
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,060
"They"!

235
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,390
Who the hell is "they"?

236
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,630
Railroad men.

237
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,000
Bounty hunters.

238
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,740
Deke Thornton.

239
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,010
Deke Thornton?

240
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,640
He was one of them?

241
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,250
How come you didn't know that?

242
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,350
Hey, gringo.

243
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,250
You can have my silver.

244
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,520
Come on, don't kill me.

245
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,040
You can have the silver.

246
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,100
But don't kill me.

247
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,270
Please.

248
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,180
Go on...

249
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,170
...go for it.

250
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,620
Fall apart.

251
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,390
Walk softly, boys.

252
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,320
What's our next move?

253
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,480
I figure Agua Verde is the closest.

254
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,730
Three days, maybe.

255
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,490
We'll get news and go to the border.

256
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,590
Maybe a payroll or bank.

257
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,930
Maybe that damn railroad!

258
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,940
That damn railroad you're talking
about sure isn't getting no easier.

259
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,730
And you boys ain't getting any younger.

260
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,240
We must start thinking beyond our guns.

261
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,680
Those days are closing fast.

262
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,960
All your planning and talking
damn near got us shot...

263
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,960
...over a few lousy bags of washers.

264
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:39,860
This was going to be
me and Tector's last job!

265
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,970
We spent all our time and
money getting ready for this!

266
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:48,140
You spent time and money running whores
while I spent my stake setting it up!

267
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:01,490
I should have been running whores
instead of stealing army horses!

268
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:04,220
While you did the planning...

269
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:07,560
...me and Tector was getting
our bell rope pulled by two...

270
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,160
...two mind you, Hondo whores!

271
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,060
And Pike was dreaming of washers!

272
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,300
He was.

273
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,570
You were matching whores...

274
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,080
...in tandem!

275
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,010
What's that?

276
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,010
One behind the other.

277
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,090
That's right!
That's what we was doing!

278
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,600
Mr. Thornton.

279
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,950
You rode with Pike.

280
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,620
What kind of man we up against?

281
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,120
The best.

282
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,960
He never got caught.

283
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,980
This was going to be my last.

284
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,820
Ain't getting around any better.

285
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:03,180
I'd like to make one
good score and back off.

286
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,680
Back off to what?

287
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,530
Have you got anything lined up?

288
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:29,200
Pershing's got troops spread out
all along the border.

289
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,440
Every one of those garrisons
will get a payroll.

290
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,380
That kind of information
is kind of hard to come by.

291
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:41,310
I didn't say it's going to be easy,
but it can be done.

292
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,650
He'll be waiting for us.

293
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,720
I wouldn't have it any other way.

294
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,970
Come on Pike, let's go.

295
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,910
You sound like you're all caught up.

296
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,740
Enough to know we've overstayed
our welcome.

297
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,740
What's wrong with you?

298
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,350
We've got plenty of money to spend,
and no worries.

299
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:20,420
They're not going to look for us
in their own backyard.

300
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,850
How can you be so damn sure?

301
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,420
Being sure is my business.

302
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,990
Being sure is my business.

303
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:31,930
Hold it!

304
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,500
Relax.

305
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,860
It's just some champagne we ordered.

306
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,500
Relax, it's just some champagne.

307
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,270
Being sure is my business.

308
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,380
Did you get him?

309
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,220
No, he got away.

310
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:02,230
You sure must have hurt that railroad.

311
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,790
They spent a lot of money
setting up that ambush.

312
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,030
I caught up with them.

313
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,460
Two or three times.

314
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,470
There was a man named Harrigan.

315
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,470
He used to have a way of doing things.

316
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,910
I made him change his ways.

317
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,740
And a hell of a lot of people...

318
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,750
...just can't stand to be wrong.

319
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,910
Pride.

320
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,480
And they can't forget it.

321
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,420
That pride, being wrong, or learn by it.

322
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,490
How about us?

323
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,270
You reckon we learned...

324
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,930
...being wrong today?

325
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,010
I sure hope to God we did.

326
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,790
Them's hot.

327
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,100
Hot damn!

328
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:22,310
Where in hell did you find him?

329
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,470
He ran with Thornton and me.

330
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,380
Did his share of killing, and more.

331
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,980
Around Langtry.

332
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:34,620
Only now he does his killing
with a coffee cup.

333
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,360
I wouldn't have it any other way either.

334
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,770
Watch out, boys!

335
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,880
Take it easy!

336
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,950
Keep his head up!
What's wrong with you?!

337
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,790
Watch him, Tector!

338
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,470
Goddamn! Son-of-a-bitch!

339
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:04,300
Get the horses up!

340
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,410
What the hell is going...

341
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,470
- Damned clumsy old bastard!
- Get up!

342
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:14,150
Get up now! Get up there, goddamn it!

343
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:19,820
Help!

344
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,930
Get over here! Help!

345
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:26,600
What's the matter with you, old man?!

346
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,330
Leave him alone!

347
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:33,000
He'll get us all killed!
I'm going to get rid of him.

348
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,230
You better not! We're sticking
together, like it used to be.

349
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:41,610
When you side with a man, you stay with
him. If you can't, you're an animal!

350
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,440
You're finished!

351
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,950
We're finished! All of us!

352
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,950
Mount up.

353
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,410
Appears Brother Pike needs help.

354
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,080
That Brother Pike
and the old man Sykes...

355
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,190
...makes me wonder if it ain't time...

356
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,720
...to pick up my chips
and find another game.

357
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:36,600
How can you side anybody
when you can't get on your horse?

358
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:13,090
That was a fine talk you gave the boys
about sticking together.

359
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,770
That Gorch came near killing me.

360
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,030
Or me him.

361
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,370
Damned old fool like me's
not worth taking along!

362
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:28,110
- We start together, we'll end together.
- That's how I see it.

363
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,380
That's the way it's always been with me.

364
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:34,110
Sorry about Deke.

365
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:36,050
I never figured him that way.

366
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,550
Say...

367
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,220
...back there in Starbuck...

368
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,060
...how did my boy do?

369
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,060
Your boy?

370
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:46,460
Crazy Lee?

371
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,900
Yes, C.L. Clarence Lee.

372
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:52,060
My daughter's boy.
Not too bright, but a good boy.

373
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,400
I kill'em now? I kill'em now?

374
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,410
No, you just hold them here.

375
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,910
Why didn't you say
he was your grandson?

376
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,580
You had enough things on your mind.

377
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:10,420
Besides, he must pull his own weight
like the rest of us.

378
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:16,260
I just wanted to make sure he didn't
let you down when things got hot.

379
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,430
He did fine.

380
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,330
Just fine.

381
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,130
All clear!

382
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,310
From here on it's Mexico, Mr. Thornton.

383
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,550
What's the closest town of any size?

384
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:13,980
Agua Verde.

385
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,220
What's in Agua Verde?

386
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:19,480
Mexicans, what else?

387
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,500
A headquarters for regulars
fighting against Villa.

388
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,400
Mapache territory.

389
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,340
Don't we follow?

390
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:35,040
No, we go back and wait.

391
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,500
We're supposed...

392
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,170
Shut up!

393
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:44,680
Why won't you tell your folks
to feed them dogs?

394
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:48,690
Won't find very much around here.
That damn Huerta's scraped it clean.

395
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,090
I have invited you to my village.

396
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:55,030
Any disrespect to my family
or to my people...

397
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,690
...I will kill you.

398
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,030
Ashamed of having us meet your people?

399
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:02,940
Yes. They don't know about
my life when I leave the village.

400
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,440
You got a sister?

401
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:07,210
I'd be proud to make her acquaintance...

402
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,540
...and that of your mama too.

403
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,940
That goes for your grandma too, sonny.

404
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,460
How bad was it?

405
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,960
Seven of the villagers were killed.
Two of them hung.

406
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:41,470
Our horses, cattle and corn, stolen.

407
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:44,580
What about the federal troops?
Didn't they protect you?

408
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,910
They were federal troops...

409
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,640
...commissioned by the traitor Huerta.

410
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:52,240
And the soldier who shot my father?

411
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,750
What was his name?

412
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:57,590
- What does it matter?
- Your father died like a man.

413
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:00,250
The names are not important.

414
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,330
How was he called?

415
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:04,820
Mapache.

416
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,160
That is name enough.

417
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,600
In Mexico...

418
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:13,760
...these are the years of sadness.

419
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,510
But if we had...

420
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:17,440
...rifles like these...

421
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:20,770
And Teresa? Did they molest her?

422
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,680
She went with them
because she wished to.

423
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,450
She became the woman of Mapache...

424
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:33,780
...and the others.
She went with them, laughing.

425
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,960
Drunk with wine and love.

426
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,790
To him, Teresa was a goddess,
to be worshipped from afar.

427
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:45,810
I tell you, she was a mango...

428
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:47,460
...ripe and waiting.

429
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,040
Angel dreams of love and
Mapache eats the mango.

430
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:55,380
That's a good trick.

431
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:10,820
Now I find that hard to believe.

432
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,560
Not so hard.

433
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,900
We all dream of being a child again.

434
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:20,240
Even the worst of us.

435
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,580
Perhaps the worst most of all.

436
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:30,080
You know what we are?

437
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,750
Yes, just so, the both of you!

438
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:35,080
And you!

439
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,420
Where is Mapache?!

440
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:54,610
All right, Pike? All right?

441
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,710
Hey, Tector, let's swap!

442
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,710
Come on, let's swap!

443
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:21,120
You must tell me. Where is Mapache?

444
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:23,970
Why do you wish to know?

445
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,970
For your father?

446
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,970
Or the whore?

447
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,080
Either you learn to live with it...

448
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,320
...or we'll leave you here.

449
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:45,480
I go with you.

450
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:18,850
You know what I'm going to do?
Steal his girl.

451
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:20,630
You are?

452
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:22,790
Here I go.

453
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:27,620
Dutch, I'm cutting in.

454
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,630
Come on, lady!

455
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:53,510
No gringos.

456
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,240
Only federales.

457
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,750
All soldiers...

458
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,590
...no bounty hunters in sight.

459
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:32,370
Now, what the hell is that?

460
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:47,950
Atención!

461
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,640
I saw one just like it in Waco.

462
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:06,640
Run on steam?

463
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:08,580
No, on alcohol or gasoline.

464
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,080
You know what I heard?

465
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:14,150
I heard they got one of those things
up north that can fly.

466
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,760
That was a balloon, you damned old fool.

467
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:21,590
No, the old man's right. They've got
motors and wings, go 60 miles an hour.

468
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:24,490
Going to use them in the war.

469
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:27,260
Let's talk to the General...

470
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,670
...about his automobile
and our extra horses.

471
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:32,260
Nice and easy.

472
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:41,340
Probably talking about us
behind our backs.

473
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:46,840
I'm down to about twenty in silver.

474
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:50,850
Since the Generalissimo cleaned out
this area, he ought to have a lot.

475
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,580
Generalissimo, hell.

476
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:56,850
He's just another bandit
grabbing all he can for himself.

477
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,020
Like some others I could mention.

478
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,860
Not so as you'd know it.

479
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:07,760
But we ain't nothing like him.
We don't hang nobody.

480
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:14,940
I hope someday these people kick
the scum like him into their graves.

481
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:17,040
We will.

482
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,040
If it takes forever!

483
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:28,610
General!

484
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:02,420
Lookie here.

485
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,990
Good looking old pony, ain't he?

486
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,430
Boy, do you know those beauties?

487
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,680
Come on.

488
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:08,520
She was my woman.

489
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:09,850
I know.

490
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:33,210
Sure ain't your woman no more.

491
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,110
Just look at her licking
inside that General's ear.

492
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,150
Why did he try to kill His Excellency?

493
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:19,580
He didn't try to kill His Excellency.
He was after the girl.

494
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:27,830
He went a little crazy
when he saw her with you.

495
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,010
Are you with the American Army?

496
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,620
No, we're not associated with anybody.

497
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:54,620
I see.

498
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,960
I was curious about the equipment
which you are carrying. That pistol...

499
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:02,620
...is strictly for the use
of army personnel.

500
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:05,700
It can't be purchased or even owned...

501
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:06,860
...legally.

502
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:08,360
Is that so?

503
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,310
Weapons are my specialty.

504
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,140
I am Commander Frederick Mohr
of the Imperial German Army.

505
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:19,890
It would be very useful for us
if we knew of some Americans...

506
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:23,890
...who did not share their
government's naive sentiments.

507
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:27,390
We share very few sentiments
with our government.

508
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:35,500
He's inviting us for a drink.

509
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:41,010
Good.

510
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:43,070
Good.

511
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,350
Shoot him.

512
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:08,760
Bang.

513
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:17,200
I gave it to him, T.C.

514
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,310
Here?

515
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,570
No, no, not there!

516
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:04,410
Wait, what are you going to do?

517
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:08,420
We got to show a little class here.

518
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,450
Right here!

519
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:33,610
It must be that garrison rail spur.

520
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:37,950
It's the easiest to hit, but I must find
a way to get it out of there.

521
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,450
What do you think?

522
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:43,790
Getting close to home.

523
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,460
Look at them gathered around the table.

524
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,700
Here we sit like kitchen help.

525
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:54,540
Why do you want us to hit that train?

526
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:57,540
Can't the General take over
the whole thing?

527
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:02,040
General Huerta is anxious
to better relations with the U. S...

528
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,820
...not to cross the border
and destroy them.

529
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,380
Usually these arms shipments
are kept pretty secret.

530
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,150
How'd you find out about this?

531
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:16,230
Mapache has a superb intelligence force
organized by my commanding officer.

532
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,820
Now, gentlemen...

533
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:19,730
...we are well organized.

534
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,060
And we'll able to pay 10,000...

535
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:24,740
...in gold.

536
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:29,400
If you're not able to do the work,
we'll find someone else.

537
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:32,510
We can do it. But we're
going to need equipment.

538
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:34,680
Do not worry.

539
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,670
Our accountant will take care of it.

540
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:42,520
My General...

541
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:46,580
...soon you will be the best
equipped general in Mexico.

542
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:49,690
Look here...

543
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:52,090
...ain't he the one.

544
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:55,690
To the host!

545
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:08,270
With your permission...

546
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:10,040
...I need a bath.

547
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:13,780
With my permission,
I think you all need a bath.

548
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,290
I don't!

549
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:21,060
What me and Tector need
is them women you're hogging.

550
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,290
Can you fix that up for us?

551
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:30,060
Gentlemen...

552
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,730
...you will excuse me.

553
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:33,900
I'm sure.

554
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:39,470
Herrera.

555
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:41,310
Let's get Angel.

556
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:56,420
I need him.

557
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,260
I'll give you someone
much better than that.

558
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:02,420
If you don't mind,
I'll make my own choice.

559
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,950
All right.

560
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:22,120
He is not important to me.

561
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:23,350
Take him.

562
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,630
I think we'll get the wagon now.

563
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,630
Hey, here come our sweeties.

564
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:48,880
Ain't them pretty?

565
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:52,540
I don't know about yours,
Lyle, but I think...

566
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,480
...I got more than I can handle.

567
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:07,170
Hey, get out of them...

568
01:04:07,330 --> 01:04:10,170
Hey, you know what they told me?

569
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:14,570
The dons of Spain built this
over 300 years ago.

570
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:16,170
Is that right?

571
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:17,500
That's right.

572
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:21,240
I tell you Lyle, I'm all for them dons.

573
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:25,680
Let's have a little target.

574
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,510
She won't get away. Turn her loose.

575
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,200
Why not!

576
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,720
Tector, look at them beauties!

577
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,760
How in the hell
can you stand it that hot?

578
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:41,990
I'm going to build me one of these
some day and live in it.

579
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,590
Hell, Lyle, look here.

580
01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:58,840
Come on, sweetheart,
let me see your teatsies.

581
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,670
I don't know why the hell
I didn't let them kill you.

582
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:09,790
I'm not going to steal guns for that
devil to rob and kill my people again.

583
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:12,180
Noble, noble. Very noble.

584
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:16,620
I didn't see no tears on your cheeks
when you rode in from Starbuck.

585
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:19,200
They were not my people.

586
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:22,120
I care about my people, my village.

587
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:27,470
Listen, boy, you ride with us,
your village don't count.

588
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,700
If it does, you don't go along.

589
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:32,140
Then I don't go along.

590
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,470
Angel, one load of guns ain't going
to stop them raiding villages.

591
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:40,210
Think about all the money you'll have.

592
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:42,980
Buy them a ranch.
Move them 1,000 miles.

593
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,880
- Buy them two or three ranches.
- One.

594
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:48,390
A very small one.

595
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:51,320
Don't you see? This is their land.

596
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:54,000
And no one will drive them away.

597
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:56,390
I'll drink to that sentiment.

598
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:58,060
And to love.

599
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:02,330
But most of all, I'll drink to gold!

600
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:21,920
You're a pain in the ass.

601
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:25,920
Would you give guns
to someone to kill your father...

602
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,930
...or mother or brother?

603
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:31,860
Ten thousand cuts
an awful lot of family ties.

604
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:34,770
My people have no guns.

605
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:38,200
But with guns...

606
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:40,380
...my people could fight.

607
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:44,110
If I could take guns...

608
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:46,540
...I would come with you.

609
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:51,550
How many cases of rifles did
Zamora say was in the shipment?

610
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,060
Sixteen.

611
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,290
Give him one.

612
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:10,900
All right.

613
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:16,140
One case and one case of ammo.
But you give up your share of the gold.

614
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:18,140
I will.

615
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:20,750
We know you will.

616
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,410
We've got that settled.

617
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:25,420
Why, you reprobate!

618
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:43,340
Boys...

619
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,840
...I want you to meet my fiancée.

620
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:52,840
They just got engaged.

621
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:54,510
I'm a son-of-a-bitch!

622
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:57,120
Trot them right in, fellas.

623
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:01,860
I'm hell on packing mules,
but I'm a delight with a pretty girl.

624
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:11,800
You want to gamble everything on
this one shipment being attacked?

625
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:14,530
If they're in Agua Verde,
they'll try for it.

626
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:17,800
- Lf? What about Juárez?
- We would have heard about it.

627
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:21,040
If they are in Agua Verde,
they will have seen Mapache.

628
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:22,880
And who in hell is Mapache?

629
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:25,810
A killer for Huerta who
calls himself a general.

630
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:27,820
He's been fighting Villa and losing.

631
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:31,390
But with enough guns, he can become
a power in northern Mexico.

632
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,720
Pike will try to get them for him.

633
01:09:33,890 --> 01:09:35,990
The train will be guarded with troops.

634
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:39,720
Not regular troops.
Green recruits, not worth a damn.

635
01:09:40,230 --> 01:09:42,900
I need 20 trained men, not recruits.

636
01:09:43,070 --> 01:09:44,400
And not this...

637
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:46,900
...gutter trash you've given me.

638
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:50,740
What you've got is 24 more days.

639
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:07,250
Never told me how you got
all tore up like that.

640
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:09,920
I met a woman I wanted to marry.

641
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:28,710
Your husband coming back?

642
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:30,110
No.

643
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:32,280
He's never coming back.

644
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,550
But you are late.

645
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:40,560
Two days late.

646
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:41,950
She had a husband.

647
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:44,900
If I had any sense, I'd have killed him.

648
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:49,230
He wasn't around.

649
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,230
I got careless.

650
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,900
One night, he walked in on us.

651
01:10:54,070 --> 01:10:58,070
Caught her with the first shot,
and got me here on the second.

652
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,470
Then the coward turned and ran.

653
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:23,330
Ever catch him?

654
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:28,010
No, but there isn't an hour that
passes that I don't think about it.

655
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:31,670
Come on! We've got a long way!

656
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:35,180
This is our last go around, Dutch.

657
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:37,780
This time, we do it right.

658
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:29,730
Just do your work.

659
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:25,960
Let's go!

660
01:17:57,670 --> 01:17:59,600
They're coming!

661
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:13,940
They're coming!

662
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:16,440
Faster!

663
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:33,970
Get over!

664
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:00,890
Help them! Get that ramp up!

665
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,890
Get that horse out of here!

666
01:20:03,230 --> 01:20:05,720
Bring them out! Get them out!

667
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:07,450
Get over there!

668
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:11,070
Get some order there!
Get those horses!

669
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:47,430
Hurry!

670
01:20:47,670 --> 01:20:49,100
Your horse kicked me.

671
01:20:49,270 --> 01:20:50,830
Run them up along here!

672
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:52,930
Where is my horse?

673
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:02,180
Hey, we got grenades!

674
01:21:02,350 --> 01:21:04,680
- Hurry! We must go!
- Be careful!

675
01:21:05,290 --> 01:21:07,120
Let's go on this.

676
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:13,460
Here we go.

677
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:18,690
Line up in two columns!

678
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,530
Corporal, give us a hand here!

679
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:27,200
We're all ready!

680
01:22:15,190 --> 01:22:16,520
Let's go!

681
01:22:18,190 --> 01:22:19,420
Let's go!

682
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:27,090
Get after that horse!

683
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:29,420
That was my horse!

684
01:23:29,670 --> 01:23:30,830
Get after him!

685
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:33,490
Get out!

686
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:38,270
Get that damn horse off my butt!

687
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:40,840
Get the horse out! The train's coming!

688
01:23:41,010 --> 01:23:42,340
- Train?
- The train's coming!

689
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:43,170
Where?

690
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:44,440
What train?

691
01:23:44,610 --> 01:23:46,100
I don't see any tr...

692
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,610
Get the goddamn horse off my foot!

693
01:24:22,650 --> 01:24:25,880
Corporal! Ride back
to the telegraph at Todos Malos...

694
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:28,820
...and tell them the railroad deputies
robbed the train...

695
01:24:28,990 --> 01:24:30,220
...and we're in pursuit!

696
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:31,890
Yes, sir!

697
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:38,660
Come on!

698
01:25:58,650 --> 01:26:00,080
Damn son-of-a...!

699
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:03,310
Come on! It's lit!

700
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:15,490
Get them horses going!

701
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:37,340
Don't shoot! It's the army!

702
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:48,350
Come on!

703
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:53,350
Let's go!

704
01:27:58,030 --> 01:27:59,860
Come on, you lazy bastard!

705
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:02,200
I'm coming, damn it!

706
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:20,390
Is it all right?

707
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:23,620
Where will they meet us?

708
01:28:24,130 --> 01:28:25,960
Agua Verde or before.

709
01:28:26,130 --> 01:28:30,060
But when we do meet them,
don't expect any open arms.

710
01:28:30,230 --> 01:28:32,720
Least we won't have to worry about Deke.

711
01:28:33,970 --> 01:28:37,300
Not after riding a half a case
of dynamite into the river.

712
01:28:37,570 --> 01:28:41,910
Don't expect him to stay there.
He'll be along and you know it.

713
01:30:58,210 --> 01:31:01,270
I would like to get hold of that
fool horse of mine.

714
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:04,620
Some Mex kid's probably
riding him home right now.

715
01:31:04,790 --> 01:31:07,720
I don't see how I could've
lost both my boots.

716
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:10,290
They were hard to get on.

717
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:12,050
The river sucked them off.

718
01:31:12,230 --> 01:31:14,290
That dynamite helped some.

719
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:18,400
Maybe the same kid riding
T.C.'s horse is wearing your boots.

720
01:31:19,630 --> 01:31:21,070
You stupid bastards!

721
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:23,900
Why did you fire at the soldiers?

722
01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:26,130
Huey started firing at them.

723
01:31:26,470 --> 01:31:27,810
I tried to stop him.

724
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:29,310
One of the bandits...

725
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:30,740
Don't blame me!

726
01:31:30,910 --> 01:31:31,640
Liar!

727
01:31:32,150 --> 01:31:33,740
Shut your mouths!

728
01:31:34,650 --> 01:31:35,810
Are we following?

729
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:38,250
Yes, or you'll face a firing squad.

730
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:43,150
Come on, T.C.!

731
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:47,090
My hair's wet!

732
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:26,700
Impossible! We have
no arms or ammunition.

733
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:34,030
They assaulted the train!

734
01:33:34,370 --> 01:33:35,770
They got the guns.

735
01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:40,610
We must go!

736
01:33:42,210 --> 01:33:45,370
Take the necessary people and
take the road to Agua Verde.

737
01:33:45,550 --> 01:33:48,880
Convince them to give you the guns.
I wait at the village.

738
01:35:15,370 --> 01:35:17,200
He's still heading east.

739
01:35:20,310 --> 01:35:22,800
Are they bluffing, or did they miss it?

740
01:35:27,450 --> 01:35:29,280
I'd say they missed it.

741
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:30,840
Take a look.

742
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:35,620
There's only five left.

743
01:35:43,970 --> 01:35:45,360
Hell, we lost them.

744
01:35:45,530 --> 01:35:46,690
I don't see how.

745
01:35:46,870 --> 01:35:50,030
Unless it was in the big valley
where the ground was hard.

746
01:35:50,210 --> 01:35:54,700
There was but one way they could take
a wagon out of there, and this is it.

747
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,470
They didn't take it out.

748
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:59,640
We haven't lost them.
I could point to them right now.

749
01:36:00,150 --> 01:36:01,810
Sit still, damn it!

750
01:36:02,150 --> 01:36:04,480
You think they aren't watching us?

751
01:36:04,990 --> 01:36:07,650
They know what this is about.
What do I have?

752
01:36:07,990 --> 01:36:10,980
Nothing but you
chicken-stealing gutter trash...

753
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:13,220
...with not even 60 rounds between you.

754
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,220
We're after men.

755
01:36:15,730 --> 01:36:17,990
And I wish to God I was with them.

756
01:36:18,570 --> 01:36:22,330
The next time you make a mistake,
I'll ride off and let you die.

757
01:36:24,410 --> 01:36:25,170
Come on.

758
01:36:33,690 --> 01:36:36,680
I never figured they'd
come down here after us.

759
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:39,460
How much you reckon
we could be worth?

760
01:36:39,530 --> 01:36:42,120
Depends on how hungry they are.

761
01:36:45,700 --> 01:36:48,530
You better stay here
and look out for big hats.

762
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:51,190
I'll go and start rigging the fireworks.

763
01:36:51,370 --> 01:36:52,530
All right.

764
01:36:57,480 --> 01:37:00,470
Get that case of explosives
off the back there!

765
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,980
Hand me down those blasting caps.

766
01:37:12,490 --> 01:37:14,550
What you doing with the dynamite?

767
01:37:16,230 --> 01:37:20,060
I figure Mapache will try to take
this load without paying for it...

768
01:37:20,230 --> 01:37:21,830
...and shoot us as well.

769
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:27,170
The thing to change his mind
is something happening to the guns.

770
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:29,570
I'm making sure something could happen.

771
01:37:29,740 --> 01:37:32,230
Hey, Pike, take a look at this.

772
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:34,510
Can you handle that?

773
01:37:36,850 --> 01:37:39,910
What I don't know,
I sure as hell am going to learn.

774
01:38:49,660 --> 01:38:51,820
My people are here for their guns.

775
01:38:57,260 --> 01:38:59,490
You were supposed to be guarding us.

776
01:38:59,670 --> 01:39:01,500
I never heard them,
didn't even see them.

777
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:20,280
They apologize and ask you
to forgive them for their lack of trust.

778
01:39:20,850 --> 01:39:23,520
But only by caution
do they remain alive.

779
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:31,190
Tell them not to break that fuse.

780
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,700
These people from your village?

781
01:39:35,870 --> 01:39:38,630
They are part of the village,
but not from it.

782
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:43,200
They are puro Indio and
these mountains belong to them.

783
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,060
I'd say those fellows know
how to handle themselves.

784
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:11,070
They've fought Apaches
for a 1,000 years.

785
01:40:11,170 --> 01:40:12,660
That's a sure way to learn.

786
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:17,180
If they ever get armed, this whole
country will go up in smoke.

787
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:19,830
That it will, son. That it will.

788
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:23,340
They made damn fools out of us.

789
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:30,020
A man can't sleep with both eyes closed
for fear of getting his throat cut.

790
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:31,090
Where were you?

791
01:40:31,590 --> 01:40:33,250
You listen to me.

792
01:40:33,430 --> 01:40:38,360
If you get up and help once in a while,
I wouldn't got caught so easy.

793
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:57,040
With the new guns and ammunition,
this couldn't have happened.

794
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:25,810
Swing your leaders wide, old man!

795
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:28,140
- Bring them on!
- Come on!

796
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:43,920
Come on, horse!

797
01:41:57,780 --> 01:41:58,840
Hold up!

798
01:41:59,010 --> 01:42:00,340
Whoa there!

799
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:03,770
Mapache's?

800
01:42:04,450 --> 01:42:06,110
Let's hope they aren't Villa's.

801
01:42:20,030 --> 01:42:21,690
We are friends.

802
01:42:21,970 --> 01:42:24,030
We are from el General Mapache.

803
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:26,370
Tell the one in front to come here.

804
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:27,800
Alone.

805
01:42:33,550 --> 01:42:35,040
I am coming.

806
01:42:35,380 --> 01:42:37,210
I am your friend, remember?

807
01:42:40,550 --> 01:42:41,990
We are friends.

808
01:42:42,150 --> 01:42:43,490
All of us.

809
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:47,380
I bring you love and affection
from el General.

810
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:54,060
You bring the guns with you?

811
01:42:56,670 --> 01:42:58,730
What bravery you have done!

812
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:02,230
I am to escort you to the General.

813
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:05,670
Tell him to come closer.

814
01:43:05,850 --> 01:43:06,830
I hear.

815
01:43:07,910 --> 01:43:10,010
I am coming, my friend.

816
01:43:13,850 --> 01:43:14,910
Recognize this?

817
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:27,360
Any trouble, no guns for the General.

818
01:43:33,940 --> 01:43:35,430
Very smart!

819
01:43:35,610 --> 01:43:38,870
That's very smart for you
damn gringos.

820
01:43:39,050 --> 01:43:40,880
So nobody can rob the guns.

821
01:43:41,610 --> 01:43:42,770
Nobody.

822
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:44,710
I am not afraid.

823
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:46,550
They are not afraid.

824
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:48,780
You blow up the wagon, you die.

825
01:43:48,950 --> 01:43:50,550
Or we kill you pretty soon.

826
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:53,050
But we are amigos.

827
01:43:53,390 --> 01:43:54,720
Show them, boys.

828
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:09,400
Start the ball, Tector.

829
01:44:18,820 --> 01:44:21,150
Please cut the fuse.

830
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:27,650
Please.

831
01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:05,790
El General waits
in Agua Verde to meet with you.

832
01:45:05,970 --> 01:45:09,460
Tell the General one of us
will be there to trade tomorrow.

833
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:11,690
Any trouble...

834
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:13,030
...no guns.

835
01:45:27,990 --> 01:45:29,650
Damn gringos!

836
01:46:05,020 --> 01:46:07,580
Get them up there! Get them over!

837
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:18,030
Get up there! Get up!

838
01:46:43,630 --> 01:46:44,890
You bring the guns?

839
01:46:45,630 --> 01:46:47,620
Don't worry, we've got them.

840
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:49,460
Hidden.

841
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:54,970
When I get my share of the gold,
2,500 dollars' worth...

842
01:46:55,140 --> 01:46:57,470
...I'll tell you where four cases are.

843
01:46:58,810 --> 01:47:01,470
The others are waiting
for me at the wagon.

844
01:47:01,810 --> 01:47:04,580
If I don't show up pretty
quick, they'll blow it.

845
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:08,750
You fix it goddamn good, no?
You fool me.

846
01:47:09,490 --> 01:47:12,420
Our accountant will pay you immediately.

847
01:47:14,590 --> 01:47:16,250
When do we get our guns?

848
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:19,760
The quicker I get back,
the quicker you get the next load.

849
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:25,160
Open it up.

850
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,680
Up the arroyo, about two miles...

851
01:47:39,850 --> 01:47:42,290
...you'll find three cases of rifles...

852
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:45,290
...and one case of ammunition
hidden in the bush.

853
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:55,460
I understand you have a machine gun.

854
01:47:58,040 --> 01:48:01,030
Our contract called for
16 cases of rifles...

855
01:48:01,210 --> 01:48:03,640
...and ammunition for $10,000.

856
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:05,470
Not a machine gun.

857
01:48:08,980 --> 01:48:11,210
That's our present to the General.

858
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:16,310
Gringo, you fight with Mapache.

859
01:48:20,730 --> 01:48:22,160
I'll think about it.

860
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:26,500
In case he don't find them...

861
01:48:26,730 --> 01:48:27,990
Go.

862
01:48:28,330 --> 01:48:30,000
I trust him.

863
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:57,190
Why don't you stir up some grub?

864
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:59,260
Why don't you go to hell?

865
01:49:12,610 --> 01:49:13,770
Shit!

866
01:49:16,120 --> 01:49:17,280
Damn it!

867
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:22,450
Damn it, Pike must've found you
under a rock.

868
01:49:22,620 --> 01:49:23,780
You whip me?

869
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:25,610
Nope.

870
01:49:25,790 --> 01:49:28,620
But you better hope
I don't get riled enough...

871
01:49:28,790 --> 01:49:31,230
...to dog you when this is over.

872
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:34,590
You're not going to get a chance
to dry gulch me, old man.

873
01:49:35,230 --> 01:49:36,960
We'll see.

874
01:49:37,740 --> 01:49:39,170
We'll see.

875
01:49:40,410 --> 01:49:41,960
Pike's coming!

876
01:49:47,750 --> 01:49:50,150
He's got it. Carrying gold.

877
01:49:52,150 --> 01:49:53,580
Any trouble?

878
01:49:53,750 --> 01:49:55,740
Just from carrying this weight.

879
01:49:57,820 --> 01:50:00,090
Pike, I want to go next.

880
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:03,320
You and Lyle take the next load,
with the machine gun.

881
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:07,830
Then Angel and Dutch. Freddie,
you follow and get the pack horses.

882
01:50:15,110 --> 01:50:18,770
It must be mounted on a tripod!

883
01:50:19,610 --> 01:50:22,270
It must be mounted on a tripod.

884
01:50:46,870 --> 01:50:48,700
They're crazy bastards!

885
01:52:06,620 --> 01:52:08,610
Put it on the tripod!

886
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:34,080
We brought the last of it, General.

887
01:52:54,430 --> 01:52:56,260
At the arroyo, in the wagon.

888
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:07,110
Keep the wagon, we'll keep the horses.

889
01:53:09,850 --> 01:53:12,510
How many cases did you take
from the train?

890
01:53:13,290 --> 01:53:16,850
Sixteen cases of rifles.
We lost one on the trail.

891
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:18,520
He stole it.

892
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:22,190
The mother of the girl
he killed told me so.

893
01:54:21,790 --> 01:54:23,780
I'm wasting time here.

894
01:54:33,630 --> 01:54:35,730
He's a thief. You take care of him.

895
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:34,790
Well, he had guts.

896
01:55:35,530 --> 01:55:37,190
We're lucky he didn't talk.

897
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:40,460
He played his string right to the end.

898
01:55:48,310 --> 01:55:52,040
Her own mama turned him in
like some kind of Judas.

899
01:55:52,310 --> 01:55:54,210
Sykes says we should go after him.

900
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:58,210
How will we do that?
They got guns and 200 men.

901
01:55:58,820 --> 01:56:00,150
No way.

902
01:56:00,820 --> 01:56:02,550
No way at all.

903
01:56:03,490 --> 01:56:04,980
Is that Sykes?

904
01:56:31,250 --> 01:56:32,510
Mapache!

905
01:56:36,090 --> 01:56:37,080
Thornton.

906
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:43,090
I got him.

907
01:56:46,930 --> 01:56:47,920
They got Freddie.

908
01:56:50,100 --> 01:56:51,530
He looks hit pretty bad.

909
01:56:51,870 --> 01:56:54,030
Damn that Deke Thornton to hell!

910
01:56:54,610 --> 01:56:57,270
What would you do? He gave his word.

911
01:56:57,540 --> 01:56:59,700
Gave his word to a railroad.

912
01:56:59,880 --> 01:57:00,710
It's his word!

913
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:04,280
That ain't what counts!
It's who you give it to!

914
01:57:11,120 --> 01:57:14,720
We can stay up here and
kick hell out of them!

915
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:20,560
No, we're running out of water.

916
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:23,560
Run for the border?

917
01:57:25,470 --> 01:57:28,410
They'd follow us every step of the way.
I know Thornton.

918
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:31,230
I'm tired of being hunted.

919
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:36,070
Let's go to Agua Verde.
Let the General take care of those boys.

920
01:57:37,420 --> 01:57:38,250
You're crazy.

921
01:57:40,590 --> 01:57:43,150
He would just as soon
kill us as break wind.

922
01:57:43,420 --> 01:57:48,150
He's so tickled with the guns, he'll be
celebrating and happy to do us a favor.

923
01:57:48,490 --> 01:57:50,830
Thornton won't follow us in there.

924
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,160
While they're picking over Freddie...

925
01:57:54,330 --> 01:57:57,320
...we'll find a back trail
and head for town.

926
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:02,500
What about our gold?

927
01:58:09,950 --> 01:58:12,440
We'll take one sack to pay our way.

928
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:14,270
Bury the rest.

929
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:19,280
Together.

930
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:39,870
Look out, Jess!

931
01:58:47,390 --> 01:58:50,380
Lots of blood, then it stops.
No tracks.

932
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:52,380
Ten dollars says he's dead by now.

933
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:54,990
Take us a day to find him if he is.

934
01:58:55,390 --> 01:58:57,660
If not, he has a gun on us right now.

935
01:59:02,730 --> 01:59:04,170
Let's find the others.

936
01:59:04,340 --> 01:59:07,000
Just leave him here? He's worth money.

937
01:59:07,740 --> 01:59:11,730
Ride out tomorrow, if you can stay
on your horse, and watch the buzzards.

938
01:59:11,910 --> 01:59:13,400
They'll show you.

939
01:59:13,750 --> 01:59:15,180
What if he ain't dead?

940
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:17,070
That's your problem.

941
01:59:17,580 --> 01:59:18,910
Let's go!

942
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:52,430
I hate to see that.

943
02:00:52,780 --> 02:00:54,270
No more than I do.

944
02:01:17,640 --> 02:01:20,470
Welcome amigos!
You come for your friend, no?

945
02:01:30,820 --> 02:01:32,480
I want to buy him back.

946
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:40,150
I don't think he looks worth too much.

947
02:01:47,070 --> 02:01:49,000
I don't think he'll live long.

948
02:01:49,330 --> 02:01:51,170
I'll give half my share.

949
02:01:51,340 --> 02:01:54,830
I need no gold.
And I don't sell this one.

950
02:01:55,010 --> 02:01:56,740
You've had your fun with him.

951
02:01:56,910 --> 02:01:59,170
El General is happy with the guns.

952
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:02,010
Why don't you go get a drink?

953
02:02:02,180 --> 02:02:04,910
Enjoy yourself.
There are women everywhere.

954
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:11,580
Don't be foolish and change his mood.

955
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:56,390
Son-of-a-bitch!

956
02:03:08,580 --> 02:03:09,980
Why not?

957
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:26,320
There ain't nobody here!

958
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:30,090
There's wagon tracks
and somebody was here!

959
02:03:30,270 --> 02:03:31,670
They ain't here now!

960
02:03:38,010 --> 02:03:39,840
Army patrol!

961
02:03:40,350 --> 02:03:41,680
Coming this way!

962
02:06:16,600 --> 02:06:18,430
You said dos for two!

963
02:06:18,600 --> 02:06:20,830
Here's your dos
and one to grow on.

964
02:06:21,010 --> 02:06:23,440
That's all you'll get out of me.

965
02:06:55,640 --> 02:06:57,200
Let's go.

966
02:07:08,390 --> 02:07:09,880
Why not?

967
02:10:54,550 --> 02:10:55,710
What do you want?

968
02:11:01,050 --> 02:11:02,380
We want Angel.

969
02:11:04,120 --> 02:11:06,060
You want Angel, no?

970
02:11:06,220 --> 02:11:07,380
All right.

971
02:11:07,560 --> 02:11:09,550
I'm going to give him to you.

972
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:12,760
Bitch!

973
02:15:37,460 --> 02:15:39,290
Come on, you lazy bastard!

974
02:16:15,230 --> 02:16:17,330
Give them hell, Pike!

975
02:16:23,740 --> 02:16:25,330
No, Pike!

976
02:17:20,400 --> 02:17:21,800
Look at them.

977
02:17:22,570 --> 02:17:23,900
Come on.

978
02:17:24,070 --> 02:17:27,230
- Come on, T.C.! This is fine!
- Wait for me!

979
02:17:27,400 --> 02:17:29,800
Come on, let's get all the guns.

980
02:17:30,640 --> 02:17:33,130
This is just like a big old picnic!

981
02:17:33,410 --> 02:17:35,310
Here's a rifle for you.

982
02:18:04,510 --> 02:18:06,000
He's got a gun.

983
02:18:10,450 --> 02:18:12,010
It's them!

984
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:14,610
It's the Gorches!

985
02:18:14,790 --> 02:18:17,280
Come on, get up there, Coffer.
Come on.

986
02:18:17,620 --> 02:18:19,110
Mr. Thornton...

987
02:18:19,290 --> 02:18:20,780
...it's them.

988
02:18:20,960 --> 02:18:22,450
It is them.

989
02:18:25,960 --> 02:18:29,130
This boy's got gold in his teeth.
Let me see your knife.

990
02:18:29,300 --> 02:18:31,460
- Here.
- Let me see your knife!

991
02:18:35,370 --> 02:18:36,460
Should we load up?

992
02:18:37,810 --> 02:18:39,970
Do we wait for Jess or meet him?

993
02:18:40,140 --> 02:18:44,710
If he's waiting for buzzards to lead
him to Sykes, he's got a long wait.

994
02:18:44,880 --> 02:18:46,320
Look! We got them all.

995
02:18:47,320 --> 02:18:49,220
There he is.

996
02:18:49,490 --> 02:18:50,890
There's Pike.

997
02:18:51,050 --> 02:18:54,320
There, you ain't so damned
much now, are you, Mr. Pike?

998
02:19:01,900 --> 02:19:03,390
You ain't coming?

999
02:19:10,070 --> 02:19:12,060
Maybe we should wait for Jess.

1000
02:19:13,680 --> 02:19:15,910
No, we pick him up on the way.

1001
02:19:16,080 --> 02:19:18,010
I want to get out of this damn place.

1002
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:21,140
Anyway these boys'll
start going ripe by tomorrow.

1003
02:19:21,250 --> 02:19:22,740
We got to move.

1004
02:19:26,020 --> 02:19:29,020
"I went to the river and
I couldn't get across.

1005
02:19:29,190 --> 02:19:32,090
"Singing polly wolly doodle all the day,

1006
02:19:32,260 --> 02:19:35,360
"I jumped on a buzzard 'cause
I thought he was a horse,

1007
02:19:35,530 --> 02:19:38,190
"Singing polly wolly doodle all the day.

1008
02:19:38,370 --> 02:19:39,930
"Fare thee well..."

1009
02:21:11,860 --> 02:21:14,800
- Didn't expect to find you here.
- Why not?

1010
02:21:15,470 --> 02:21:17,020
I sent them back.

1011
02:21:17,700 --> 02:21:19,290
That's all I said I'd do.

1012
02:21:19,800 --> 02:21:21,290
They didn't get far.

1013
02:21:22,210 --> 02:21:23,190
I figured.

1014
02:21:26,710 --> 02:21:28,540
What are your plans?

1015
02:21:29,810 --> 02:21:31,470
Drift around down here.

1016
02:21:31,650 --> 02:21:32,980
Try to stay out of jail.

1017
02:21:34,380 --> 02:21:37,550
Well, me and the boys here...

1018
02:21:37,990 --> 02:21:39,150
...got work to do.

1019
02:21:43,890 --> 02:21:45,050
Want to come?

1020
02:21:47,330 --> 02:21:49,730
Ain't like it used to be, but...

1021
02:21:50,230 --> 02:21:51,500
...it'll do.
