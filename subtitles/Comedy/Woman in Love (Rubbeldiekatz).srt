1
00:01:46,637 --> 00:01:50,469
Hey, Gonzales!
Surprise-surprise.

2
00:02:15,124 --> 00:02:18,410
Hey, Bunny.
What a surprise!

3
00:02:20,045 --> 00:02:21,076
Bunny.

4
00:02:23,716 --> 00:02:25,590
You've got this all wrong.

5
00:02:32,558 --> 00:02:34,467
Why didn't the dog bark?

6
00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:01,418
Ms Voss, we've arrived.

7
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,380
I know.

8
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:42,164
Sarah Voss!

9
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,425
You say nothing about the split-up.
-Right.

10
00:03:49,802 --> 00:03:52,008
Why don't you try my hormone pills?

11
00:03:52,179 --> 00:03:55,963
They kill the libido dead.
It's so liberating.

12
00:03:57,977 --> 00:04:00,848
Pills meant for sex offenders
aren't my thing.

13
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:04,355
If they hit the spot for those perverts,
they must be good.

14
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:07,775
We should stop chasing
the family dream.

15
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,979
It's just media propaganda.

16
00:04:10,155 --> 00:04:11,614
Like Christmas,

17
00:04:11,782 --> 00:04:16,610
saving schemes, happiness and Africa.
-So why did you marry twice, then?

18
00:04:16,787 --> 00:04:19,907
That was the 80s.
We all took coke, were romantic...

19
00:04:20,082 --> 00:04:21,410
and unrealistic.

20
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:24,252
At least you had friends.
I just get the run-around.

21
00:04:25,045 --> 00:04:27,370
Friends, baby-girl, friends?

22
00:04:27,631 --> 00:04:30,715
You're thin and rich,
what woman would be friends with you?

23
00:04:30,884 --> 00:04:34,467
Personal relationships
are for losers with time to kill.

24
00:04:34,638 --> 00:04:37,259
Maybe not being single
is a personal need.

25
00:04:37,474 --> 00:04:39,301
Smile, baby-girl!

26
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:05,580
How about a beer?
-No, I've got to go.

27
00:05:05,753 --> 00:05:08,291
This is the fifth time I've seen you,

28
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:10,582
and you're better each time.

29
00:05:10,758 --> 00:05:12,466
I'm delighted.
Thank you.

30
00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:14,922
Could you sign here?

31
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,296
Yes...
-It's for my husband.

32
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:19,589
Yes.
-He was at the premiere,

33
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:21,309
then he had a fall,

34
00:05:21,644 --> 00:05:24,217
and now he's in hospital.

35
00:05:24,563 --> 00:05:26,888
I'm so sorry.
For your sake, he'll recover.

36
00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:30,316
All right...
-Audition time!

37
00:05:30,527 --> 00:05:34,026
I'm coming.
That's my brother hurrying me along.

38
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,898
Bye, then. And thanks.
-Bye.

39
00:05:41,246 --> 00:05:43,488
It's so touching
when they enjoy it.

40
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,501
And the compliments I got!
-I get that, but...

41
00:05:47,336 --> 00:05:49,079
You're playing to the oldies.

42
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,788
You have to keep developing.
-What?

43
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:54,540
You don't have a clue.

44
00:05:54,718 --> 00:05:59,629
The majority of German viewers are
over 60, and the percentage is growing.

45
00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:03,765
So you see,
old age is Germany's future.

46
00:06:03,936 --> 00:06:07,637
And I'm building up a fan base.
-What an attitude to have!

47
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:10,900
Get some perspective.

48
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:13,978
Listen,
the audition tonight

49
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:17,357
is being held
by a hip young crowd.

50
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,574
They're young and exciting.

51
00:06:19,743 --> 00:06:21,534
You have that in common.

52
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:24,902
Do you have a problem
with getting naked?

53
00:06:25,082 --> 00:06:27,205
What, now?.
-In the film.

54
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:33,079
Do you mind nudity around people
or animals, particularly apes?

55
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:37,594
That's just a suit.
We haven't cast the part yet.

56
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:42,464
Do you mind dancing naked with an ape?
With plenty of physical contact.

57
00:06:42,975 --> 00:06:44,932
Sex, too, maybe.
Love scenes.

58
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:49,767
ENTER YOUR PIN

59
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,142
So you dance with a monkey!

60
00:06:52,443 --> 00:06:55,112
What's the big deal?
Why is he always like this?

61
00:07:01,577 --> 00:07:03,119
How much?
-150.

62
00:07:03,412 --> 00:07:04,871
The tickets alone are 80.

63
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:07,453
I'm lending you nothing.
-Ask the refusenik here.

64
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:10,577
Goal!

65
00:07:11,962 --> 00:07:16,007
I'm not a bad actor, am I?
-I can't really judge.

66
00:07:16,508 --> 00:07:19,628
I know about cars:
whether they run or not.

67
00:07:22,014 --> 00:07:23,425
I'm not bad.

68
00:07:25,142 --> 00:07:27,099
It's showbiz I can't handle.

69
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:28,426
Rubbeldiekatz...

70
00:07:29,104 --> 00:07:31,476
A good homepage would help matters.

71
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:38,689
Are you stupid or what?
The homepage is great.

72
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:42,732
I do it for you for free
and you just whinge.

73
00:07:45,287 --> 00:07:46,283
Yes!

74
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:52,000
Hey, sausages!
-Not for you!

75
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:55,503
You'll be too fat.
-That's my business.

76
00:07:56,465 --> 00:07:58,505
No.
You have an audition tomorrow.

77
00:07:58,676 --> 00:08:00,419
I've had it with your auditions.

78
00:08:01,095 --> 00:08:05,009
That's too bad.
This time it's... Hollywood! Not apes!

79
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:07,468
You're kidding?
-Not at all.

80
00:08:07,768 --> 00:08:10,140
The Yanks are here, doing a Nazi film,

81
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,052
and you're being auditioned...

82
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,931
So who's the moron-manager now?.
Hollywood!

83
00:08:25,703 --> 00:08:28,408
This is a woman's part.
-Rubbish.

84
00:08:28,914 --> 00:08:32,117
It says Maria Schneider.
-But they checked your site...

85
00:08:33,127 --> 00:08:35,084
Uh-oh!
-What do you mean, uh-oh?

86
00:08:35,504 --> 00:08:38,920
I changed a few things.
The font...

87
00:08:39,091 --> 00:08:42,840
And there are fewer photos.
-That's me as a woman!

88
00:08:43,262 --> 00:08:46,880
You don't understand web design.
Check the font! It's sick!

89
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:51,513
Sick? It's pink!
It's as kitsch as cuddly kittens!

90
00:08:51,854 --> 00:08:53,562
It's shit!
Shit. Look at it!

91
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:56,935
You're useless.
-Jan's a good web designer.

92
00:08:57,693 --> 00:08:59,733
The Seidl Dance School's homepage

93
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,563
is beautiful.
-Thanks.

94
00:09:02,197 --> 00:09:06,277
Sounds wicked: Maria Schneider
head of the League of German Maidens,

95
00:09:06,452 --> 00:09:09,619
wife of an Obersturmführer,
falls in love with a Jewess,

96
00:09:09,788 --> 00:09:12,030
Rahel,
who's hiding in the League.

97
00:09:12,207 --> 00:09:13,998
You're going to go there in drag?

98
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:17,087
Why do Hollywood guys
only do films about Nazis here?

99
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:19,712
They're Germany's greatest hit.

100
00:09:19,882 --> 00:09:25,671
It's them or health-insurance companies.
-The public ones are the baddies and...

101
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:28,549
No... Wait...
-You know what?

102
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:32,556
I'll do it! It's a great role
for a young, talented actress.

103
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,769
But you aren't one.
You're a big, ugly dude.

104
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,645
I've played women
thousands of times on stage.

105
00:09:39,818 --> 00:09:42,309
I can do two days as a Nazi boss.

106
00:09:42,821 --> 00:09:44,648
Right?
I am not a bad actor.

107
00:09:45,824 --> 00:09:47,532
Jürgen, say something.

108
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,733
And stop stroking that cat!
-It calms me down.

109
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,414
But you're the manager.
-I think Alex has a point.

110
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:59,370
You've got your wigs.
And clothes from the theatre.

111
00:10:01,465 --> 00:10:03,043
Two days. For this:

112
00:10:13,185 --> 00:10:14,181
SOCIAL SECURITY

113
00:10:17,606 --> 00:10:19,100
Alexandra Honk.

114
00:10:20,776 --> 00:10:22,187
What a forest!

115
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:24,398
It's got caught up.

116
00:10:24,613 --> 00:10:28,029
Stop...
-Skip into these tights, you'll be fine.

117
00:10:29,076 --> 00:10:30,072
God!

118
00:10:30,577 --> 00:10:31,692
My God!

119
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:34,369
They're as big as I am.

120
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,706
God, you look like a naked mole!

121
00:10:39,128 --> 00:10:40,670
Now the crucial bit.

122
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:42,168
Up!
-Okay?

123
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:43,714
Fine. Down.

124
00:10:44,008 --> 00:10:45,799
What would you prefer,
silicon or lentils?

125
00:10:45,968 --> 00:10:48,293
Lentils?
-It's better for the environment.

126
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,964
These ones.
-All right.

127
00:10:53,142 --> 00:10:54,138
Nice!

128
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,604
You need freshening up.
We'll contour the lips,

129
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:01,974
add highlights,
make the eyes smoky.

130
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:04,767
They're a woman's weapon.

131
00:11:40,856 --> 00:11:44,190
Hi, I'm Alex.
-Feeling nervous?

132
00:11:46,195 --> 00:11:47,226
A little.

133
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:49,566
Really?

134
00:11:51,742 --> 00:11:52,773
I'm not.

135
00:11:56,497 --> 00:11:59,415
Honk. Alexandra Honk.
Could you come here?

136
00:12:00,084 --> 00:12:01,364
Yes. Er...

137
00:12:02,962 --> 00:12:04,670
So...

138
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:07,580
Bye.
-Feel free to hurry up.

139
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:35,076
Okay, we start with the weeping scene.
Start when you're ready.

140
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:37,203
Now.

141
00:12:37,913 --> 00:12:39,324
I start when I'm ready, right?

142
00:12:39,498 --> 00:12:41,455
That's what I said, yes.

143
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:48,464
Very German face.

144
00:12:49,216 --> 00:12:52,170
My fatherland.
Hitler's land.

145
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:57,136
I was such a believer.
We were all seduced by that little man.

146
00:12:57,558 --> 00:12:59,218
He led us to the abyss.

147
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:12,112
But...
Should I do it again?

148
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:15,653
Okay, this time...

149
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,493
My fatherland.

150
00:13:21,206 --> 00:13:22,451
Hitler's land.

151
00:13:49,193 --> 00:13:50,308
Little German maiden.

152
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,565
Congratulations, you're cast.

153
00:13:54,531 --> 00:13:56,274
Hollywood.

154
00:13:57,785 --> 00:13:59,493
Hollywood.

155
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,010
You see, I'm not a bad actor.

156
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,476
Right?
I put breasts on and I made it.

157
00:15:12,818 --> 00:15:15,689
I made it.
-To Maria Schneider.

158
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:17,980
To women.
-To the Nazi film.

159
00:15:18,574 --> 00:15:19,949
To Adolf Hitler.

160
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:24,493
Are you nuts?
-What?

161
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:28,534
Without that idiot
we wouldn't have a film industry.

162
00:15:30,836 --> 00:15:32,579
Let's drink to the women, then.

163
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:35,163
To beautiful women.
-Hollywood.

164
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:48,222
What strength's that?
-70 or 80.

165
00:15:50,022 --> 00:15:52,098
I like it.
-Excuse me.

166
00:15:56,111 --> 00:15:57,689
Nice stride.

167
00:16:08,123 --> 00:16:11,492
Wedding preparations
mean more than my birthday.

168
00:16:11,794 --> 00:16:13,870
It's so full of people here.

169
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,755
I'm out on the balcony.

170
00:16:17,341 --> 00:16:19,499
What?
Oh, him.

171
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:22,512
Yes... no.
We're not a couple anymore.

172
00:16:23,222 --> 00:16:26,425
No, I've no idea who he's screwing now.
And you...

173
00:16:27,393 --> 00:16:31,142
are marrying Ralph,
my dear little sister.

174
00:16:32,022 --> 00:16:33,397
So it's all perfect.

175
00:16:35,609 --> 00:16:38,776
I have to check up on the guests.
I'll call you back.

176
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,784
Hi!
-Hi.

177
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:50,497
I'm Alex.

178
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,366
I'm Sarah.
Do you always eavesdrop?

179
00:16:54,211 --> 00:16:56,453
No, I just happened to be passing.

180
00:17:00,843 --> 00:17:02,006
Is the dog yours?

181
00:17:07,474 --> 00:17:10,475
What if he is?
-I'd put him on his lead...

182
00:17:11,478 --> 00:17:13,352
It's not a lead.
It's a chain.

183
00:17:13,605 --> 00:17:15,894
People wear them like this.
-Say...

184
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:18,391
don't I know you?
-Not at all.

185
00:17:23,824 --> 00:17:26,742
Can I get to know you?
-If so, then how about now?.

186
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:33,332
I'm actually here
with my brothers and a mate.

187
00:17:34,209 --> 00:17:35,407
We're having a barbeque.

188
00:17:38,005 --> 00:17:40,626
It's like this:
I'm going that way,

189
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:45,297
and you can come along,
or you can go back to your barbeque

190
00:17:45,638 --> 00:17:46,753
and your brothers.

191
00:18:20,673 --> 00:18:22,251
What's wrong?

192
00:18:28,764 --> 00:18:30,258
I'll be back in a moment.

193
00:18:38,857 --> 00:18:40,684
Oh, God!

194
00:18:41,735 --> 00:18:43,360
Fuck... fuck!

195
00:18:44,822 --> 00:18:45,818
No, shit!

196
00:18:52,913 --> 00:18:53,992
Oh dear.

197
00:18:54,748 --> 00:18:56,123
Fuck, fuck.

198
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,496
Damn.

199
00:19:15,394 --> 00:19:16,722
Hey. Well...

200
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,917
You're not wearing underwear.

201
00:19:41,086 --> 00:19:43,873
I never do.
-Nor do I.

202
00:19:50,512 --> 00:19:53,798
This won't be a senseless affair, right?
-It's just the start!

203
00:19:53,932 --> 00:19:56,553
I couldn't take it
-Come off it.

204
00:20:01,357 --> 00:20:03,848
Alex!

205
00:20:05,361 --> 00:20:06,903
Alex!

206
00:20:08,072 --> 00:20:09,946
I've had it. I want to go home.

207
00:20:10,783 --> 00:20:12,325
He'll have fallen asleep.

208
00:20:13,577 --> 00:20:15,071
Had an adrenalin rush,

209
00:20:15,245 --> 00:20:16,905
then the alcohol did him in.

210
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,283
He'll have frozen to death.
-Really?

211
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:22,535
Rubbish, it's thawing.
-He might have.

212
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:24,122
Look, there's a guy there.

213
00:20:24,296 --> 00:20:25,874
I'll ask him, okay.

214
00:20:28,676 --> 00:20:30,716
Hello? Hello.

215
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:34,931
Excuse me, do you know where Alex is?

216
00:20:35,891 --> 00:20:38,726
You're looking for Alex.
-Yes, where is he?

217
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:44,643
He'll be right back.
-Where was he? We looked everywhere.

218
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:50,817
He'll be ready in a moment.
-Were you partying with him all along?

219
00:20:51,323 --> 00:20:53,896
We looked everywhere for him.

220
00:20:55,411 --> 00:20:57,902
Here he is, our Alex.
-Hello!

221
00:20:58,247 --> 00:21:00,405
Well, what would you like, you three?

222
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:04,747
But... you're straight.

223
00:21:06,463 --> 00:21:09,499
Actually yes,
but we're looking for our brother.

224
00:22:58,033 --> 00:23:01,900
You know what? An orgasm
has the same dramatic arc as a sneeze.

225
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:13,668
What's wrong?

226
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:17,629
Nothing.

227
00:23:19,555 --> 00:23:21,512
Just aftershocks.

228
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:25,142
Basti?

229
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,061
Jürgen?

230
00:23:28,814 --> 00:23:30,273
Basti?

231
00:23:31,483 --> 00:23:32,598
Jürgen?

232
00:23:51,337 --> 00:23:52,535
One hour.

233
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:05,089
Yes?

234
00:24:07,686 --> 00:24:10,640
Morning. You ordered breakfast.
-Yes?

235
00:24:13,984 --> 00:24:15,099
So...

236
00:24:18,072 --> 00:24:20,361
Where would you care to eat breakfast?

237
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,825
Here, at the piano.

238
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:30,579
Yes...

239
00:24:42,221 --> 00:24:44,130
It was a crazy night!

240
00:24:45,683 --> 00:24:48,767
Yes...
Large scrambled eggs with salmon twice.

241
00:24:49,144 --> 00:24:51,931
Crimean caviar, large,
eggs Benedict,

242
00:24:52,564 --> 00:24:55,850
dessert,
cheese platter, orange juice, champagne.

243
00:24:56,026 --> 00:24:57,141
That's everything.

244
00:24:57,736 --> 00:25:00,274
If you'd be so kind as to sign this.

245
00:25:07,663 --> 00:25:09,074
Thanks.

246
00:25:12,084 --> 00:25:14,540
Yes. Well I've got no cash on me.

247
00:25:14,753 --> 00:25:18,122
Yes. Well thank you very much,
enjoy your meal.

248
00:25:18,507 --> 00:25:19,705
Thanks.

249
00:25:31,145 --> 00:25:33,019
Hello.
-Hey there.

250
00:25:33,564 --> 00:25:34,727
What a night, eh?

251
00:25:35,899 --> 00:25:37,062
Yes, it was... cosy.

252
00:25:37,651 --> 00:25:39,193
Come along, it was pretty...

253
00:25:39,903 --> 00:25:41,860
It was comfort sex.

254
00:25:43,407 --> 00:25:45,234
Not too bad.

255
00:25:46,035 --> 00:25:47,494
Crap! Hi.

256
00:25:47,995 --> 00:25:49,703
I'm in a taxi.

257
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:52,079
I'll be there in a moment. Yes...

258
00:25:57,921 --> 00:25:59,119
Comfort sex.

259
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:03,924
Mobile, purse...

260
00:26:04,511 --> 00:26:05,791
script.

261
00:26:09,308 --> 00:26:11,716
Wow! We ordered a lot to eat.

262
00:26:13,312 --> 00:26:15,388
Enjoy your meal.
-Will we meet again?

263
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:19,024
Hope so.
-When, then?

264
00:26:20,569 --> 00:26:21,980
Who's to say?

265
00:26:30,746 --> 00:26:33,367
Shit... shit.
Yes?

266
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:36,239
Where are you?
We looked everywhere.

267
00:26:39,421 --> 00:26:40,999
It's the reading rehearsal.

268
00:26:41,298 --> 00:26:43,006
What?
Christ alive.

269
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:47,794
Come home. You can't go as a man.
You have to turn into a woman.

270
00:26:48,889 --> 00:26:51,261
I'll be right there, okay.
-Yes.

271
00:26:54,687 --> 00:26:55,766
Shit.

272
00:26:56,605 --> 00:26:57,933
Hi.
-Morning.

273
00:26:58,107 --> 00:27:00,313
Can I exit here?
-How did you enter?

274
00:27:01,026 --> 00:27:02,401
I was visiting.

275
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:17,202
Thanks.

276
00:27:26,176 --> 00:27:27,374
Where did you end up?

277
00:27:29,805 --> 00:27:31,347
You... were with us.

278
00:27:39,523 --> 00:27:41,314
Hey... hey!

279
00:27:41,483 --> 00:27:43,025
Maike!
Are you nuts?

280
00:27:43,193 --> 00:27:45,150
I have to talk to you.
-Maike, listen.

281
00:27:45,404 --> 00:27:49,105
You want to talk but I've no time. Okay?
-No. We never talk.

282
00:27:49,325 --> 00:27:53,952
We say we'll talk but never do.
I'm sick of talking about talking.

283
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:56,529
No time.
I'll call you tomorrow,

284
00:27:57,166 --> 00:28:00,617
I don't believe you.
It's the last thing you'll do.

285
00:28:00,836 --> 00:28:04,371
Why talk about relationships?
We don't even have one.

286
00:28:05,341 --> 00:28:07,168
That's the point.
-The point of what?

287
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:10,130
Okay...

288
00:28:10,304 --> 00:28:13,340
Tell me to my face, here and now,

289
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,684
you don't love me anymore,
you've got a new girl.

290
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,762
What do you mean, a new girl?

291
00:28:21,273 --> 00:28:22,553
You don't own me.

292
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:24,441
We're not guinea pigs.

293
00:28:25,361 --> 00:28:28,315
Why do you always argue with me?

294
00:28:28,781 --> 00:28:31,237
Cause you always avoid conversation.

295
00:28:31,367 --> 00:28:33,656
See?
You argue, argue, and argue.

296
00:28:33,827 --> 00:28:35,535
It goes round in circles.

297
00:28:35,871 --> 00:28:37,911
You can't enjoy it, either.
-Right.

298
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:40,573
But what can you do?
-Okay, Maike, listen.

299
00:28:40,751 --> 00:28:44,452
Let's stop this. I'm running late.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

300
00:28:44,964 --> 00:28:46,458
Hello Maike.

301
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:47,879
Okay.

302
00:28:55,683 --> 00:28:57,094
I'll be in touch.

303
00:28:57,768 --> 00:29:00,176
You call me.
-I'll call you.

304
00:29:09,571 --> 00:29:14,114
Hello. This is Alexandra Honk.
I'm her manager. Where can we park?

305
00:29:15,327 --> 00:29:17,533
That's not for us. We're the cast.

306
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,505
Shit...

307
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:31,167
Come on, we're late.
-Help me. It's not easy.

308
00:29:37,433 --> 00:29:39,342
Is that the Waffen SS? Look!

309
00:29:39,518 --> 00:29:42,187
Anyone for a latte macchiato?
-Great...

310
00:29:44,148 --> 00:29:46,022
Excuse me,
do you have a light?

311
00:29:49,403 --> 00:29:51,360
No. I'm sorry. No.

312
00:29:53,699 --> 00:29:55,656
It's an addiction. You know?.

313
00:29:59,705 --> 00:30:02,161
Hey.
The Führer just chatted me up!

314
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:07,079
That's Thomas Henning.
He was in Broken Brain part one.

315
00:30:07,963 --> 00:30:09,208
Mr Henning!

316
00:30:09,381 --> 00:30:11,338
Imagine me meeting you! Mad!

317
00:30:11,467 --> 00:30:13,507
I'm a huge fan of yours.

318
00:30:13,761 --> 00:30:15,754
I even had a haircut like yours.

319
00:30:16,221 --> 00:30:18,178
Alex, come here.
This is Mr Henning.

320
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:22,678
This is my client, Alexandra Honk.
She plays your wife, Maria Schneider.

321
00:30:23,729 --> 00:30:25,354
Hi...

322
00:30:26,065 --> 00:30:28,936
Lovely...
I'm Thomas,

323
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:31,018
I play Obersturmführer Helmut,

324
00:30:32,863 --> 00:30:34,143
You can't imagine

325
00:30:34,323 --> 00:30:38,700
how your performance as that mad cripple
in Broken Brain affected me.

326
00:30:38,911 --> 00:30:40,619
It was mad.
-Yes.

327
00:30:41,455 --> 00:30:44,124
I spent seven months
in a prison psychiatric ward

328
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:45,869
to get into character.

329
00:30:47,544 --> 00:30:51,672
That was no piece of cake.
I have some pen friends there, still.

330
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:54,378
When I got the Oscar,

331
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:58,175
I dedicated it to the boys in there.
-Mad. Your voice is like on screen.

332
00:30:59,473 --> 00:31:01,133
Should you need a manager,

333
00:31:01,308 --> 00:31:05,306
our agency
happens to have spare capacity...

334
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:07,851
This would be
for the German market alone

335
00:31:08,691 --> 00:31:11,478
International Management.
I represent him.

336
00:31:12,444 --> 00:31:14,318
Her!
-Her.

337
00:31:16,281 --> 00:31:18,238
I have to go in there.

338
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,449
To get into the mood.
-Right.

339
00:31:21,203 --> 00:31:22,531
See you at the warm-up.

340
00:31:23,956 --> 00:31:26,661
Great.
No expense spared.

341
00:31:33,882 --> 00:31:36,966
Alexandra.
Will you sit down with the others?

342
00:31:43,267 --> 00:31:48,427
Welcome to the read-through.
I'm Anne, the director's assistant.

343
00:31:48,564 --> 00:31:51,482
You know John, our director,
from auditions.

344
00:31:51,859 --> 00:31:53,686
So, we'll start in a moment.

345
00:31:53,861 --> 00:31:58,155
Our great star, Ms Voss,
has told us she's running late.

346
00:31:59,783 --> 00:32:02,950
Excuse me. A round of applause, please,
for Thomas Henning.

347
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:10,453
We'll be speaking English on set,
so remember:

348
00:32:12,588 --> 00:32:16,835
Your opinions are welcome,
so if anyone has anything to say,

349
00:32:17,092 --> 00:32:19,500
go ahead and say it.

350
00:32:20,346 --> 00:32:21,377
Alex?

351
00:32:22,765 --> 00:32:24,805
Oh, hello Ms Voss!

352
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:27,434
Excuse me. Hello.

353
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,845
Hello. Welcome. How lovely.
-Sorry...

354
00:32:31,273 --> 00:32:32,732
No problem...

355
00:32:33,442 --> 00:32:36,645
I know her. I know her.
-Everyone does.

356
00:32:41,075 --> 00:32:43,827
So Alex...
You wanted to...

357
00:32:50,459 --> 00:32:52,416
Anyone got a pen, a biro?

358
00:33:28,872 --> 00:33:30,366
The scene in which I speak...

359
00:33:35,921 --> 00:33:37,664
Oh, exactly. John.

360
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,338
It's a minor...

361
00:33:51,895 --> 00:33:54,647
Despite her background and her faith,

362
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:58,266
a Jewess falls in love
with a Nazi league leader, Maria.

363
00:33:58,652 --> 00:33:59,731
And vice versa.

364
00:34:05,492 --> 00:34:06,951
That's exciting.

365
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:17,451
You get me?
There's no way that the leading actress

366
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:20,294
does only one love scene,
then bang!

367
00:34:20,633 --> 00:34:23,669
I get shot, the Nazis all arrive...
It's old hat!

368
00:34:29,058 --> 00:34:30,967
The point is:

369
00:34:58,253 --> 00:35:00,495
Your social security card
will take a moment.

370
00:35:00,673 --> 00:35:02,048
Okay.

371
00:35:02,216 --> 00:35:03,959
Alexandra, would you come here?

372
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:08,555
I'm waiting for my social security card.
-Don't worry about that.

373
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:12,011
I need it or I won't get work elsewhere.

374
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:15,056
Yes, yes. Come along.
And hurry up about it.

375
00:35:16,105 --> 00:35:17,101
March!

376
00:35:34,748 --> 00:35:38,497
I think you made some very good points.
So Arthur back there

377
00:35:38,794 --> 00:35:40,751
will do a re-write
and you'll stay.

378
00:35:41,547 --> 00:35:42,958
Really?

379
00:36:09,825 --> 00:36:11,070
But I just said that...

380
00:36:37,603 --> 00:36:39,596
Tip-top!
Here's the contract.

381
00:36:40,397 --> 00:36:42,888
Well, what do you say?
Want a regular coffee?

382
00:36:43,108 --> 00:36:44,187
What, how?.

383
00:36:44,943 --> 00:36:46,022
The Yanks are crazy!

384
00:36:46,153 --> 00:36:49,107
They take me for the goddess of love.
But so what? I'm in!

385
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:54,740
I've got the low-down.
You're shooting for 20 days.

386
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,118
It's too much. Are you nuts?
-You'll like it.

387
00:36:57,581 --> 00:36:59,372
You are not a bad actor.

388
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:02,033
You and Sarah Voss
are the leading roles.

389
00:37:02,211 --> 00:37:04,880
Forget Thomas Henning!
-I can do 2 days, not 20!

390
00:37:05,172 --> 00:37:08,956
Those Yanks wanted to give me
a set price but I said no way.

391
00:37:09,301 --> 00:37:12,421
Every single day must be paid for!

392
00:37:13,347 --> 00:37:15,470
That's management!
-It's impossible.

393
00:37:16,308 --> 00:37:18,929
Take it easy.
-I slept with the lead actress!

394
00:37:19,478 --> 00:37:20,853
I slept with the lead actress!

395
00:37:21,146 --> 00:37:24,847
Just now?. Is that what goes on in there?
-No. Yesterday.

396
00:37:24,984 --> 00:37:28,982
I'd never heard of Sarah Voss.
-Or George Clooney, the pope or Coke.

397
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:33,109
Alexandra, come for your
make up and your costume.

398
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:38,824
One moment. I... yes.
Fuck. What do I do now?.

399
00:37:39,373 --> 00:37:43,323
Break your contract, pay the 50 million.
-Shit. Is that the fine?

400
00:37:43,627 --> 00:37:45,667
What did you think?
A slap on the wrist?

401
00:37:46,005 --> 00:37:48,247
Alexander, make up, costume!

402
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:55,136
And, as you're leading cast,
you're invited to the Gala tonight.

403
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:56,884
Okay?
-Thanks but...

404
00:37:57,016 --> 00:38:01,014
Sure thing. We'd be glad to come.
It's an important event.

405
00:38:01,645 --> 00:38:03,970
We want four tickets.
-I've got one.

406
00:38:04,398 --> 00:38:06,141
We're coming.
Thanks.

407
00:38:07,026 --> 00:38:08,935
I'll see what I can do.

408
00:38:10,487 --> 00:38:12,729
I don't want to go there.
I don't want to.

409
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:14,616
Listen up, Bro.

410
00:38:14,783 --> 00:38:16,941
You just do what they tell you.

411
00:38:17,202 --> 00:38:20,322
Think of our bank account.
These are the Yanks!

412
00:38:20,497 --> 00:38:23,664
They don't hang about.
They started a war in Iraq.

413
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:27,957
Off with the clothes, love.
-What do I take off?

414
00:38:28,088 --> 00:38:29,666
The lot?
-Yes, the lot.

415
00:38:30,507 --> 00:38:33,212
Now?.
-Rubbeldiekatz! We'll turn our backs.

416
00:38:34,887 --> 00:38:37,093
Have you got a cabin?
I'm ticklish.

417
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:41,674
Thank you.
-That will do.

418
00:38:42,728 --> 00:38:44,270
My God!

419
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:47,516
She's cute.

420
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:50,396
It felt great.

421
00:38:55,449 --> 00:38:59,613
Well?
-Holy moley! More corns than a corn dog!

422
00:39:01,747 --> 00:39:03,621
Football...
-Come here.

423
00:39:03,999 --> 00:39:06,455
Go! Lord, did you take
a potato-peeler to them...

424
00:39:06,794 --> 00:39:08,870
or what?
Oh, anyway...

425
00:39:13,509 --> 00:39:17,637
Well... great. A little sexy, but...

426
00:39:18,305 --> 00:39:19,965
ladylike, too. Wow.

427
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,176
Yes. The Nazis were good
at haircuts and knitwear.

428
00:39:23,352 --> 00:39:25,641
The tailoring was emancipated...

429
00:39:26,146 --> 00:39:27,724
Sugar!

430
00:39:28,357 --> 00:39:31,228
Come, come!
This is for you this evening.

431
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:33,278
That's your colour.

432
00:39:33,445 --> 00:39:34,820
Nude.
-What?

433
00:39:35,114 --> 00:39:38,364
Nude: skin.
All right. This is for you.

434
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,652
These are fit for the red carpet.

435
00:39:41,745 --> 00:39:47,415
Nipples. You'll drive the men crazy.
20 percent more attention guaranteed.

436
00:39:47,751 --> 00:39:49,293
Look. It's this way up.

437
00:39:49,503 --> 00:39:51,959
Upwards 23, downwards 53
years old.

438
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:53,999
23, 53. Get it?

439
00:39:54,633 --> 00:39:57,919
So... that's the one.
All right.

440
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:12,693
Park it, son.
-We don't do that.

441
00:40:13,152 --> 00:40:14,943
Then it's staying there.

442
00:40:15,362 --> 00:40:16,904
What's that tent you're wearing?

443
00:40:17,197 --> 00:40:18,608
It's no tent.

444
00:40:18,782 --> 00:40:22,862
This dress is by Guido-Maria-Kretschmer.
Most women would kill for it.

445
00:40:23,037 --> 00:40:25,991
What's with the colour?
Skin-colour or what?

446
00:40:26,165 --> 00:40:29,748
It's nude you idiot.
It's in nowadays.

447
00:40:30,085 --> 00:40:32,541
You wear something skin-like
over your skin?

448
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,754
That's fashion.
What?

449
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,130
They're squinting.
-What? Oh God!

450
00:40:37,259 --> 00:40:38,539
Fix them.
-No.

451
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,795
Fix them for me.
-I'm not touching you there!

452
00:40:41,055 --> 00:40:43,012
Do it!
-All right, all right!

453
00:40:43,182 --> 00:40:45,471
Good girl.
Don't let anyone see.

454
00:40:48,395 --> 00:40:50,435
Got it.
-About time!

455
00:41:03,202 --> 00:41:05,278
We're expected.

456
00:41:24,473 --> 00:41:25,967
Well, fuck it.

457
00:41:34,984 --> 00:41:36,264
Wicked, prawns!

458
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:39,528
Where's the booze?
Oh, excuse me.

459
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,033
Oh, sweet.

460
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,329
It'll last longer...
Thanks.

461
00:41:53,669 --> 00:41:55,792
Germany... the unemployed.

462
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,755
It's just too real.

463
00:41:57,923 --> 00:41:59,666
Opposite my house in Hollywood

464
00:42:00,009 --> 00:42:02,963
there's this bum with the best breasts

465
00:42:03,137 --> 00:42:04,596
I have ever seen.

466
00:42:06,265 --> 00:42:08,008
The American dream. Great!

467
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,515
Hey, Alex.
This here is David,

468
00:42:12,938 --> 00:42:14,053
a friend of mine from New York.

469
00:42:20,112 --> 00:42:22,520
David is doing a reading
in the Jewish community.

470
00:42:22,823 --> 00:42:24,021
Yes.

471
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:27,200
So you play the head of the League?
-Yes.

472
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:30,454
I'm from Berlin, too.

473
00:42:30,664 --> 00:42:32,242
My parents are from New York.

474
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,874
My grandparents didn't make it.

475
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:38,080
I'm so sorry.

476
00:42:40,299 --> 00:42:42,007
Say, you got a boyfriend?

477
00:42:42,968 --> 00:42:47,215
What?
-Hey, maybe we can go eat together.

478
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:51,724
Maybe you'll come
to my reading next week.

479
00:42:53,062 --> 00:42:55,268
Sure thing...

480
00:42:59,026 --> 00:43:00,354
I know, they squint.

481
00:43:01,654 --> 00:43:03,196
So what?

482
00:43:03,364 --> 00:43:06,448
Just look at her!
What a cheap slag!

483
00:43:07,409 --> 00:43:09,698
Look at that Alex, and you know...

484
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:13,204
Excuse me.
I have to compliment you.

485
00:43:13,707 --> 00:43:17,123
May I introduce myself?
Honk International Management.

486
00:43:18,045 --> 00:43:19,705
Should you be interested.

487
00:43:20,005 --> 00:43:23,374
Honk:
He's One Notorious Knave.

488
00:43:25,344 --> 00:43:26,507
Thanks, anyway.

489
00:43:26,887 --> 00:43:29,805
Who is this Alex, anyway?
-No one knows.

490
00:43:30,224 --> 00:43:32,845
Why not?
-Hey...

491
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,516
We can't accept visitors...

492
00:43:35,854 --> 00:43:38,725
They took that troll instead of me!
-Yanks!

493
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,227
She may be a bit austere,

494
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,943
but, unlike you, she can act.

495
00:43:44,697 --> 00:43:47,615
And she's no empty, heartless blonde.

496
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:49,907
You take that back right now.

497
00:43:50,536 --> 00:43:54,119
I'll do nothing of the sort, you twit.
I'm giving it to you straight.

498
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:06,373
Jürgen!
-You okay?

499
00:44:06,927 --> 00:44:09,252
Who's that?
-My brothers.

500
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:10,793
Hey!
-Them?

501
00:44:11,598 --> 00:44:15,049
All right! You're tough,
when you're in a group, huh?

502
00:44:15,227 --> 00:44:16,935
Come and get a load of this.

503
00:44:17,271 --> 00:44:19,062
Here we go.

504
00:44:27,573 --> 00:44:29,198
That was not the time and place.

505
00:44:29,616 --> 00:44:31,276
Thanks, Brother Judas!

506
00:44:31,577 --> 00:44:34,115
She's a good woman.
-A devil-woman.

507
00:44:35,122 --> 00:44:35,952
How is she in bed?

508
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:39,708
Does she scream Oh, God
when she comes?

509
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:41,872
Mind your business.

510
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:44,206
What? Just cause she's famous or what?

511
00:44:45,007 --> 00:44:48,921
Why did a woman of her class
demean herself by having sex with you?

512
00:44:49,094 --> 00:44:52,130
She was rated 17th sexiest woman alive
last year.

513
00:44:52,348 --> 00:44:55,053
They offered her about a million
for a nude shoot.

514
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:57,930
And you had it all for free.
-An hour long.

515
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:05,562
I jerk off to 1 to 35 all year long,

516
00:45:06,195 --> 00:45:08,900
when there's a new poll,
I start all over.

517
00:45:09,448 --> 00:45:12,449
What, you jerked off over Sarah?
-Yes.

518
00:45:12,785 --> 00:45:15,358
You stop that.
-You can't make me.

519
00:45:15,663 --> 00:45:17,074
Please.
-A whole hour?

520
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:20,367
If she got her tits done,
she'd get two million

521
00:45:20,542 --> 00:45:22,416
and come in at number ten.

522
00:45:22,711 --> 00:45:24,620
Well, twelve...
-That's enough.

523
00:45:25,464 --> 00:45:29,248
I introduce this nice girl to you,
and you just think smutty thoughts!

524
00:45:29,677 --> 00:45:32,250
Who's the smutty one, huh?
You did all the stuff.

525
00:45:32,471 --> 00:45:36,551
We're just talking. Like always.
-Right. We always speak openly.

526
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:40,677
Honestly,
if she ever did a nude shoot,

527
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:42,813
then, as a man,
I'd be bound to...

528
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,645
rejoice.
-Rejoice.

529
00:45:45,985 --> 00:45:48,393
You're reducing a woman to a body.
Right?

530
00:45:49,571 --> 00:45:51,279
Right.
-Right.

531
00:45:51,865 --> 00:45:55,199
Did you not notice she has a brain
and other qualities?

532
00:45:57,621 --> 00:45:59,032
That's not the issue.

533
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:04,325
An hour! Like hell.

534
00:46:14,555 --> 00:46:17,639
My ideal in this world,
its hero so bold

535
00:46:17,891 --> 00:46:19,516
is a man both great and blond

536
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:24,348
He comes from a fairy-tale land,
gives me his strong hand

537
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,890
that can break me
like snapping a twig...

538
00:46:32,865 --> 00:46:36,815
No great idea will ever perish

539
00:46:37,036 --> 00:46:40,072
due to a couple of snow flakes.

540
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:43,203
In your hearts

541
00:46:43,542 --> 00:46:46,115
the passion and fervour

542
00:46:46,295 --> 00:46:49,545
of the German fairy-tale glow hot.

543
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:55,961
Breeding in keeping with type

544
00:46:58,515 --> 00:46:59,630
has the advantage

545
00:46:59,933 --> 00:47:03,551
of preventing the intermingling
of characteristics...

546
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:09,062
The Aryan woman will always remain

547
00:47:09,234 --> 00:47:11,025
the ideal!

548
00:47:13,572 --> 00:47:14,947
But...

549
00:47:16,742 --> 00:47:20,822
But...
A German woman

550
00:47:21,163 --> 00:47:25,030
is not to be judged
by her racial qualities alone.

551
00:47:26,835 --> 00:47:28,578
Empty, heartless blondes

552
00:47:28,837 --> 00:47:32,787
are of no value to us.

553
00:47:57,866 --> 00:47:59,942
Are we ready for the next shoot or what?

554
00:48:00,411 --> 00:48:02,071
No retouches here.

555
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:03,991
Hurry up.

556
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,198
His name's Waldemar,

557
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:10,336
He is not a star
His home is in Berlin

558
00:48:10,629 --> 00:48:12,420
And I'm in love with him

559
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:15,460
The boy's the very contrary
of my ideal

560
00:48:15,843 --> 00:48:18,879
I do not know what I'm about
and I accept the deal

561
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:21,090
Make her pregnant.

562
00:48:21,807 --> 00:48:23,005
I can't do it up.
-Here.

563
00:48:23,642 --> 00:48:25,469
Twins are too much.
Leave it to me.

564
00:48:33,694 --> 00:48:37,277
Sugar,
go and get Hannah changed over there.

565
00:48:37,448 --> 00:48:39,488
We need a bit of privacy.
All of you!

566
00:48:39,867 --> 00:48:42,619
A bit of privacy, if you please!

567
00:48:43,996 --> 00:48:45,574
Have you had the operation?

568
00:48:45,998 --> 00:48:47,409
Take more hormones.

569
00:48:48,208 --> 00:48:51,743
You're wonderful, love.
I'm not easily shocked, you know?.

570
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,704
Come here.
Are the operations over?

571
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:57,461
What? Not yet.

572
00:48:58,177 --> 00:49:00,750
I am a man.
I need the work.

573
00:49:02,056 --> 00:49:04,725
I need the work.
-We all have our secrets.

574
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:06,636
I'm as silent as the grave.

575
00:49:08,187 --> 00:49:09,978
So on we go, Fräulein!

576
00:49:23,494 --> 00:49:26,828
Children, that's enough.
There's a war on!

577
00:49:33,712 --> 00:49:35,503
Once more
and I'll break your arms.

578
00:49:36,215 --> 00:49:37,495
All right.

579
00:49:38,092 --> 00:49:39,966
Ready.

580
00:49:41,971 --> 00:49:44,343
Thomas, can we...

581
00:49:44,598 --> 00:49:46,507
Can we run through our lines?

582
00:49:53,816 --> 00:49:57,102
His name is Waldemar, his hair is dark

583
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:59,733
He's neither proud nor brave
but I'm in love with him

584
00:50:00,614 --> 00:50:03,781
Waldemar, he's a barbarian...

585
00:50:03,951 --> 00:50:06,407
WITH THE FÜHRER TO VICTORY!

586
00:50:06,578 --> 00:50:09,828
... MEET YOU... THURSDAY...
I YEARN FOR YOU... RAHEL

587
00:50:16,922 --> 00:50:19,460
You smell good.
It reminds me of something.

588
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:34,057
Alex...

589
00:50:34,523 --> 00:50:37,275
Alex, your face is too red.

590
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:40,645
It's not good on screen.
John wants you to stop with it.

591
00:50:45,784 --> 00:50:47,029
Mind if I French you?

592
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:49,954
Sorry?
-French kiss.

593
00:50:51,206 --> 00:50:52,237
Well...

594
00:50:59,757 --> 00:51:01,085
Are you insane? Stop!

595
00:51:09,586 --> 00:51:11,911
Just to the waist.
-I won't do it.

596
00:51:12,089 --> 00:51:13,998
No way.
-Alex, stop the dramatics.

597
00:51:17,677 --> 00:51:18,875
Your contract doesn't say that.

598
00:51:19,304 --> 00:51:21,213
Alexandra, you're holding us up.

599
00:51:21,556 --> 00:51:23,264
Pipe down.
This is about art,

600
00:51:23,558 --> 00:51:26,429
and you're only
the assistant director. Okay,

601
00:51:26,978 --> 00:51:30,014
I'll do it. Anne, thank you.
We'll reverse the roles.

602
00:51:30,482 --> 00:51:32,688
Okay, then
we'll reverse the roles.

603
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:40,065
Relax.
Imagine a beautiful male chest.

604
00:51:51,294 --> 00:51:53,666
Hey, are you still wearing the tits?

605
00:51:53,922 --> 00:51:56,627
Yes, why?
-Don't you find that weird?

606
00:51:56,967 --> 00:51:59,043
No. Why?
-What's that in your hair?

607
00:51:59,344 --> 00:52:01,301
A hair band.
Sarah gave it to me.

608
00:52:01,763 --> 00:52:04,966
Wonderful, but take it and the tits off.

609
00:52:05,142 --> 00:52:07,598
You have to separate acting
from family life.

610
00:52:07,769 --> 00:52:10,723
It's unprofessional.
-No. I'm getting into character.

611
00:52:11,231 --> 00:52:14,102
Method acting.
This is cinema, not TV.

612
00:52:14,526 --> 00:52:16,020
Seriously, now.

613
00:52:16,194 --> 00:52:18,732
It bothers me, too.
Those things down there

614
00:52:19,072 --> 00:52:22,322
and your ugly face up there.
-I really like the feel of it.

615
00:52:23,243 --> 00:52:24,523
He likes the feel of it.

616
00:52:24,745 --> 00:52:26,405
You've no idea about women.

617
00:52:27,164 --> 00:52:29,240
I've plenty.
-All right, then:

618
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,493
Where is the G-spot?
You don't know.

619
00:52:31,668 --> 00:52:33,328
I do.
-Where, then? -Up top.

620
00:52:33,712 --> 00:52:35,455
Where?
-In the...

621
00:52:35,797 --> 00:52:38,335
Here.
What's it called?

622
00:52:38,467 --> 00:52:40,258
The finger.
-The what?

623
00:52:40,594 --> 00:52:43,797
Women have three sensitive zones.
The G-spot is just number two.

624
00:52:44,556 --> 00:52:46,964
Are you counting the breasts
individually?

625
00:52:47,267 --> 00:52:50,185
No!
-So where is the G-spot, then?

626
00:52:50,896 --> 00:52:55,190
Listen up. It's about five centimetres
from the entrance,

627
00:52:55,525 --> 00:52:57,601
on the abdominal wall side,
behind the pubis.

628
00:52:57,778 --> 00:53:00,150
Can you stop with the women's stuff.

629
00:53:00,322 --> 00:53:03,027
I'm getting confused here.

630
00:53:04,576 --> 00:53:05,821
It's like a gearbox.

631
00:53:10,874 --> 00:53:12,748
Here. As promised.

632
00:53:13,502 --> 00:53:15,293
Great. Broken Brain.

633
00:53:15,587 --> 00:53:17,129
Sit.

634
00:53:19,424 --> 00:53:21,417
Sarah!
Sarah!

635
00:53:21,885 --> 00:53:24,554
Hey.
-Alex, I have a question for you.

636
00:53:24,888 --> 00:53:26,797
I've got a hen evening tonight.

637
00:53:26,973 --> 00:53:28,764
My sister's. In Hamburg.

638
00:53:28,934 --> 00:53:31,805
But I don't know her friends.
Want to come along?

639
00:53:31,978 --> 00:53:33,638
Tonight?
-Yes.

640
00:53:33,814 --> 00:53:35,688
Or I could ask Thomas.

641
00:53:35,857 --> 00:53:38,609
I'm coming.
It's a woman's thing. Thomas!

642
00:53:39,152 --> 00:53:40,611
Yes, you're right.

643
00:53:40,821 --> 00:53:42,399
Great.
-Great.

644
00:54:01,925 --> 00:54:03,040
Yes.

645
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:07,805
What does it cost?

646
00:54:08,014 --> 00:54:09,212
398 Euros.

647
00:54:09,391 --> 00:54:10,671
398 Euros!

648
00:54:10,892 --> 00:54:13,015
It's a designer item, unique.

649
00:54:13,437 --> 00:54:15,513
Who's the whore-jacket for?

650
00:54:16,231 --> 00:54:18,307
The problem with fashion

651
00:54:18,608 --> 00:54:20,482
is that you can't hide the face.

652
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,528
It's not for everyone.

653
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:26,568
Maike...

654
00:54:27,367 --> 00:54:30,202
Nice to see you. You're looking good.
-Rubbish.

655
00:54:30,829 --> 00:54:32,738
Buying her something nice, are we?

656
00:54:32,914 --> 00:54:34,574
Who is she, the lucky thing?

657
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,872
She is...
It's for you.

658
00:54:38,086 --> 00:54:41,206
For your birthday.
-When is my birthday?

659
00:54:43,425 --> 00:54:45,750
In spring.
-No. Wrong.

660
00:54:46,178 --> 00:54:47,458
In summer.
-In autumn.

661
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,176
Idiot.

662
00:54:49,473 --> 00:54:51,466
Know what?
I don't even care

663
00:54:51,641 --> 00:54:54,393
who the cat-fur is for!
Or about anything else.

664
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:56,229
I'm leaving you.

665
00:54:58,023 --> 00:55:00,479
We're not a couple.
-That's irrelevant.

666
00:55:00,609 --> 00:55:02,483
I can leave you when I want to.

667
00:55:02,903 --> 00:55:04,730
So, what about the jacket?

668
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:07,568
To buy or not to buy?
-Kiss my ass.

669
00:55:13,872 --> 00:55:16,493
398 Euros? I'll take it.

670
00:55:19,211 --> 00:55:21,536
Welcome, Miss Alexandra...
-Honk.

671
00:55:22,589 --> 00:55:23,834
Welcome.

672
00:55:35,268 --> 00:55:37,724
Wow, you look wonderful.

673
00:55:38,021 --> 00:55:40,144
Ready for the bash of the year?
-Sure.

674
00:55:40,357 --> 00:55:42,646
It's time to party!

675
00:55:47,239 --> 00:55:50,406
Wicked you're here, Sis.
-I can't believe you're getting married!

676
00:55:50,784 --> 00:55:54,319
You're so young.
-Young? I don't want to work at 30!

677
00:55:54,704 --> 00:55:57,907
Know how much he earns?
Sure I love him, too.

678
00:55:58,959 --> 00:56:00,702
Stop, you're under arrest.

679
00:56:00,961 --> 00:56:02,918
For dull behaviour.
Kiss, now.

680
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:04,838
All right, come here Jasmina.

681
00:56:51,219 --> 00:56:53,544
Girls! One, two...

682
00:56:53,972 --> 00:56:56,890
three...
Surf's up!

683
00:56:59,644 --> 00:57:01,055
Hey party-pooper,

684
00:57:01,396 --> 00:57:03,602
show us them!
-Me?

685
00:57:04,232 --> 00:57:06,474
Boring!

686
00:57:06,777 --> 00:57:11,735
We want to see some tits!
We want to see some tits!

687
00:57:12,741 --> 00:57:15,493
We want to see, want to see,
want to see some tits!

688
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,700
Sarah, come on, join in the fun!

689
00:57:17,871 --> 00:57:19,365
Stop.
-We'll put it on YouTube.

690
00:57:19,831 --> 00:57:22,998
One, two, three...
Surf's up!

691
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:28,207
That's enough. Really.
Pull yourself together.

692
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:31,211
My God. Sarah, come on!
You should, too.

693
00:57:31,384 --> 00:57:34,053
Come on. Bye.
-She'll be right back.

694
00:57:40,352 --> 00:57:42,143
Yes. My sister.

695
00:57:42,938 --> 00:57:45,607
She's sorry, says she hopes
we have fun and aren't angry.

696
00:57:45,774 --> 00:57:47,850
Full of character, your sister.

697
00:57:48,026 --> 00:57:50,019
Yes. She's a lot wilder than me.

698
00:57:52,072 --> 00:57:53,732
I'm just no use in bed.

699
00:57:54,574 --> 00:57:58,109
You are, you're wonderful in bed.
Say cheers.

700
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:00,988
Yes, cheers.
-Cheers.

701
00:58:01,164 --> 00:58:02,160
Cheers.

702
00:58:05,544 --> 00:58:08,711
You know how it is
when a deer runs in front of your car

703
00:58:09,089 --> 00:58:10,832
and just stands there frozen?

704
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:15,337
Yes. I do.

705
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:20,426
That's me when it comes to sex.
I mean...

706
00:58:21,351 --> 00:58:23,807
I know I tend to be a bit prudish,

707
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:28,147
but when it kicks off,
I really want to act wild.

708
00:58:30,569 --> 00:58:32,229
Like her.

709
00:58:35,157 --> 00:58:36,616
Tell me, though...

710
00:58:36,908 --> 00:58:38,367
can you imagine Bambi having sex?

711
00:58:38,994 --> 00:58:40,274
Yes. Absolutely. Sure.

712
00:58:40,871 --> 00:58:43,409
Bambi really has it.
-Alex... what?

713
00:58:43,749 --> 00:58:47,367
Bambi really has it.
-You say that because you're a woman.

714
00:58:47,753 --> 00:58:50,209
Men...
They want other things.

715
00:58:50,547 --> 00:58:52,919
Don't worry.
You be Bambi, I'll do the rest.

716
00:58:54,634 --> 00:58:56,710
What?
-No...

717
00:58:57,095 --> 00:58:59,052
Yes...

718
00:59:02,184 --> 00:59:04,224
Sarah, listen, you are sexy.

719
00:59:04,561 --> 00:59:05,936
You are sexy.

720
00:59:07,189 --> 00:59:08,767
Sexy.
-You're so sweet.

721
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:10,268
So are you.

722
00:59:14,237 --> 00:59:15,648
And what about you?

723
00:59:16,114 --> 00:59:19,565
Do you have a boyfriend?
-No, I've got my brothers.

724
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:21,819
What?
-Oh, right...

725
00:59:21,995 --> 00:59:24,830
No, I had one but I left him.

726
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:28,242
Same here. Just before the shoot.

727
00:59:28,585 --> 00:59:31,041
We had no daily routine anymore.
-Hello.

728
00:59:42,015 --> 00:59:46,428
Hey, nobody likes routine.

729
00:59:46,603 --> 00:59:49,224
It was a jet-set love
that broke up in the clouds.

730
00:59:49,731 --> 00:59:51,854
Another two.
-Yes. Cheers.

731
00:59:52,359 --> 00:59:53,734
Cheers.

732
00:59:54,736 --> 00:59:58,319
And you haven't had another man since?

733
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:00,151
Not one?
-I did.

734
01:00:01,785 --> 01:00:03,196
One.

735
01:00:04,162 --> 01:00:07,329
And it was...
-Yes?

736
01:00:08,417 --> 01:00:09,792
It was like, wow!

737
01:00:10,961 --> 01:00:12,788
Yes?
-Yes. But...

738
01:00:13,213 --> 01:00:14,838
It was too intense for me.

739
01:00:18,343 --> 01:00:20,300
But intense is great, right?

740
01:00:22,139 --> 01:00:23,882
But I get so mean.

741
01:00:24,224 --> 01:00:25,932
I want to be the first one to be mean.

742
01:00:26,101 --> 01:00:27,761
So as to beat him to it.

743
01:00:28,145 --> 01:00:30,434
Who cares? He hasn't contacted me.

744
01:00:30,772 --> 01:00:33,643
But how could he?
-He'd find a way if he wanted to.

745
01:00:34,609 --> 01:00:36,685
The next morning I just ran.
It was awkward.

746
01:00:37,154 --> 01:00:39,147
You know what?
You're chicken.

747
01:00:39,531 --> 01:00:41,239
You're chicken,
but the man...

748
01:00:41,867 --> 01:00:43,527
is chicken, too.

749
01:00:43,702 --> 01:00:46,905
Maybe you can't fall in love.
-Are you nuts? Course I can.

750
01:00:47,247 --> 01:00:51,079
Well, then you have to take some risks,
open up your door.

751
01:00:51,585 --> 01:00:53,376
Or you can forget it.

752
01:00:54,045 --> 01:00:56,618
I'm always open to love.

753
01:01:01,762 --> 01:01:04,134
What makes you like a man?

754
01:01:06,016 --> 01:01:07,724
Parking skills.
-What?

755
01:01:08,143 --> 01:01:10,764
When a man parks,
you know, he leans back,

756
01:01:10,896 --> 01:01:13,601
holds the wheel with one hand,

757
01:01:13,774 --> 01:01:16,479
you see only his arms
as he eyes the parking spot,

758
01:01:16,651 --> 01:01:21,147
but then he watches you
whilst parking with one smooth motion.

759
01:01:21,698 --> 01:01:23,240
That I find sexy.

760
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:26,488
Alex, I need a man with a plan.

761
01:01:27,913 --> 01:01:30,831
I understand that.
-What makes you fall in love?

762
01:01:37,089 --> 01:01:38,120
Your health.

763
01:01:49,267 --> 01:01:51,675
If someone surprises me.
-I'm the same.

764
01:01:51,853 --> 01:01:53,893
Really?
-It's like with a good song.

765
01:01:54,189 --> 01:01:57,640
You think you can whistle along
but the tune takes a different turn.

766
01:01:57,901 --> 01:02:00,309
Right?
-Yes. -It's like...

767
01:02:00,946 --> 01:02:03,864
when you inspire each other
and dream together.

768
01:02:10,914 --> 01:02:12,871
I see what you mean...
an elephant.

769
01:02:14,918 --> 01:02:16,578
A pink one.

770
01:03:29,659 --> 01:03:32,067
That'll be 420 Euros, please.
-Right.

771
01:03:32,245 --> 01:03:33,953
So...

772
01:03:34,331 --> 01:03:35,790
Oh, my pill!

773
01:03:36,124 --> 01:03:38,117
Can you give me one?

774
01:03:38,585 --> 01:03:41,420
Are they sorted by days of the week.
-Yes.

775
01:03:42,589 --> 01:03:44,463
Have you tried out the diaphragm?

776
01:03:48,095 --> 01:03:50,764
No, not yet.
-Well...

777
01:03:52,015 --> 01:03:56,095
The rest is for you.
Get my lovely friend safely home.

778
01:03:56,394 --> 01:03:57,390
Okay?

779
01:03:57,979 --> 01:04:01,478
It was a beautiful night.
Do you know how it is to feel so in love

780
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:04,521
that you miss someone
before they've even left?

781
01:04:04,694 --> 01:04:06,521
Nope.
Not really.

782
01:04:06,947 --> 01:04:09,616
Okay...
Too bad you're not a man.

783
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:12,075
It'd be the perfect moment.

784
01:04:12,327 --> 01:04:14,236
Moon, stars,

785
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:18,116
unrestrained sex.
-Yes. That would be good.

786
01:04:20,752 --> 01:04:22,709
Bye.
-Yes. Too bad.

787
01:04:24,256 --> 01:04:26,083
Bye...

788
01:04:29,261 --> 01:04:30,720
Bye...

789
01:04:38,311 --> 01:04:39,853
Shitty door...

790
01:04:40,063 --> 01:04:41,438
It's broken.

791
01:04:43,608 --> 01:04:47,688
Even a black Amex can't open that.

792
01:04:48,739 --> 01:04:50,281
But the room card might.

793
01:04:50,866 --> 01:04:52,029
Damn.

794
01:04:52,367 --> 01:04:53,778
I lost it down town.

795
01:04:54,202 --> 01:04:55,613
It's no big deal.

796
01:04:56,830 --> 01:04:59,202
Open the door.
You must have a key. Right?

797
01:05:02,419 --> 01:05:03,913
Well?

798
01:05:14,473 --> 01:05:16,051
Fuck. Shit.

799
01:05:27,861 --> 01:05:29,106
Stop staring, idiots.

800
01:05:29,321 --> 01:05:32,156
Can you let us in on what you're up to?
-Parking.

801
01:05:32,449 --> 01:05:35,818
Why?
-Why? Why! Sarah finds it sexy.

802
01:05:36,119 --> 01:05:39,037
He can't park at all.
-You're in love, after all?

803
01:05:39,664 --> 01:05:41,039
Wait up.

804
01:05:52,177 --> 01:05:54,715
Don't say you're in love!
-Could be.

805
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:57,966
I mean, after all, it's only a feeling.

806
01:05:58,308 --> 01:06:00,929
Right?
-What, you're not meeting her, are you?

807
01:06:01,353 --> 01:06:02,931
Yes, I am!

808
01:06:03,814 --> 01:06:06,685
She won't know.
I'll be a man!

809
01:06:08,318 --> 01:06:12,363
She'll suss it!
You just stay right here, all right?

810
01:06:12,948 --> 01:06:14,490
As a man you avoid her, okay?

811
01:06:16,701 --> 01:06:18,492
Think of our account.

812
01:06:27,796 --> 01:06:29,076
Morning.
-Where are you going?

813
01:06:29,381 --> 01:06:30,959
I have to see Ms Voss.

814
01:06:32,342 --> 01:06:35,047
No one is expected.
-I just want to park.

815
01:06:35,804 --> 01:06:38,425
What?
-You won't get it, but its important.

816
01:06:38,765 --> 01:06:41,090
No.
-Between those two cars. -No.

817
01:06:41,226 --> 01:06:43,551
In that space. For a second.
-No chance.

818
01:06:46,982 --> 01:06:48,180
Sarah!

819
01:06:56,533 --> 01:06:58,158
Too bad.

820
01:07:11,673 --> 01:07:15,718
Sar-ah, you look so dolled up.

821
01:07:16,928 --> 01:07:19,763
I just felt like it.
-But you're always cold.

822
01:07:20,891 --> 01:07:22,350
God! Is it so obvious?

823
01:07:24,644 --> 01:07:26,553
Excuse me, could you bring us tea.

824
01:07:26,813 --> 01:07:28,188
Sure.
-Yes?

825
01:07:31,943 --> 01:07:34,101
It's just the beginning, but I think

826
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:36,524
I'm in love.

827
01:07:37,074 --> 01:07:38,354
In love?

828
01:07:38,533 --> 01:07:39,648
Yes!

829
01:07:39,826 --> 01:07:43,491
I don't know how it happened so fast,
but after our lovely evening

830
01:07:44,247 --> 01:07:46,240
I really felt in the mood for love.

831
01:07:47,209 --> 01:07:49,166
And then I met Thomas,

832
01:07:50,128 --> 01:07:51,670
and he smiled at me,

833
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:55,794
and everything we spoke of
ran through my mind,

834
01:07:58,011 --> 01:08:01,297
so I opened up my door,
well, his door,

835
01:08:01,515 --> 01:08:02,630
and we were at his...

836
01:08:02,808 --> 01:08:06,142
Hang on...
you were in Thomas' room last night?

837
01:08:07,229 --> 01:08:10,396
So what?
-That's going at it pretty fast!

838
01:08:10,565 --> 01:08:12,605
But it was lovely, and listen:

839
01:08:12,776 --> 01:08:14,852
Bambi really had it.
-No!

840
01:08:16,029 --> 01:08:17,772
No!
-And you know what?

841
01:08:17,948 --> 01:08:20,439
Thomas cares for Mallorcan street dogs.

842
01:08:21,118 --> 01:08:22,826
I find this great.

843
01:08:23,036 --> 01:08:24,199
I love dogs.

844
01:08:24,621 --> 01:08:26,364
So what? So do I.
It's nothing special.

845
01:08:26,998 --> 01:08:29,038
But you don't know Thomas at all!

846
01:08:29,626 --> 01:08:32,793
Thomas may be a psychopathic
lady-killer.

847
01:08:33,171 --> 01:08:34,582
Or worse.

848
01:08:35,674 --> 01:08:37,750
Sarah, he plays a guy
from the Waffen SS!

849
01:08:37,968 --> 01:08:41,302
And they killed millions of people.
-Yes.

850
01:08:41,638 --> 01:08:44,046
But Thomas didn't.
-Then he acts well.

851
01:08:46,351 --> 01:08:47,976
What's eating you, Alex?

852
01:08:48,854 --> 01:08:51,938
What's up?
You're my friend. Why aren't you happy?

853
01:08:52,107 --> 01:08:54,064
I am.
Sorry.

854
01:08:55,485 --> 01:08:57,608
I am happy for you.

855
01:08:58,280 --> 01:08:59,655
Yes?

856
01:09:00,949 --> 01:09:04,199
I wanted to thank you.
I only dared because of you.

857
01:09:04,536 --> 01:09:06,078
My pleasure.

858
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:09,664
Maybe you'll fall in love again soon.
-No.

859
01:09:10,417 --> 01:09:12,990
Thank you.
-Yesterday you go telling me

860
01:09:13,211 --> 01:09:16,710
you're always ready for love,
and now you've changed your mind?

861
01:09:16,882 --> 01:09:17,463
Well?

862
01:09:27,017 --> 01:09:28,559
You're just scared, too.

863
01:09:30,061 --> 01:09:31,472
Come here.

864
01:09:31,897 --> 01:09:34,768
Come here, let me give you a hug.
Alex...

865
01:09:37,986 --> 01:09:39,729
You're such a great woman.

866
01:09:41,364 --> 01:09:43,736
I'm so glad we've made friends.

867
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:53,030
But...

868
01:09:53,210 --> 01:09:55,333
Must run.
I've got to go through my lines.

869
01:09:57,756 --> 01:09:59,167
Oh shit!

870
01:10:08,934 --> 01:10:10,559
What a fool am I!

871
01:10:11,853 --> 01:10:13,181
Alex!

872
01:10:13,772 --> 01:10:15,100
My Fräulein.

873
01:10:51,768 --> 01:10:52,931
Chocolate cake?

874
01:10:57,649 --> 01:11:01,563
Do you know about John's new
film project, Vampire Killer Babies.

875
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:04,856
No.
-It's about five lesbian vampires

876
01:11:05,365 --> 01:11:08,117
who love fast cars.
They get murdered

877
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:13,037
but then take revenge. It's the biggest,
most expensive trilogy of all times.

878
01:11:13,206 --> 01:11:15,958
A-ha?
-John wants you for one of the roles.

879
01:11:17,002 --> 01:11:18,544
Really?

880
01:12:04,883 --> 01:12:05,962
What?

881
01:12:36,873 --> 01:12:38,498
My God, you slut!

882
01:12:38,834 --> 01:12:42,250
You're making out with a woman
whilst I defend the fatherland!

883
01:12:42,421 --> 01:12:45,505
That's repulsive.
-A woman's weapon isn't a ladle!

884
01:12:46,174 --> 01:12:48,630
What do you know of the lust for life?

885
01:12:54,474 --> 01:12:56,550
No SS officer
would take that from a woman!

886
01:12:58,270 --> 01:13:00,097
Sarah, he thinks like an SS officer.

887
01:13:00,647 --> 01:13:02,604
Don't you talk to me like that!

888
01:13:05,026 --> 01:13:07,066
Thomas!
-You're a woman beater.

889
01:13:07,529 --> 01:13:10,447
Go on, hit me in front of everyone,
why don't you?

890
01:13:10,866 --> 01:13:13,404
Stop!
-Leave the woman in peace.

891
01:13:13,618 --> 01:13:14,781
That's an order.

892
01:13:15,746 --> 01:13:17,952
What's with you all?
Are you nuts?

893
01:13:19,916 --> 01:13:22,205
Are you all right?
-I told you what Thomas is.

894
01:13:22,419 --> 01:13:23,415
A swine.

895
01:13:24,921 --> 01:13:26,664
How are you?
-Fine.

896
01:13:34,973 --> 01:13:37,131
I think our nerves are shot.

897
01:13:38,143 --> 01:13:41,975
After the farewell party
I'll fly to Mallorca. You know?.

898
01:13:42,147 --> 01:13:45,931
There are beautiful parts to Germany
but a break is good, too.

899
01:13:46,109 --> 01:13:48,185
So, what's on? Fusilli!

900
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:49,981
Yes.
-Just not too spicy.

901
01:13:50,155 --> 01:13:51,483
Of course.

902
01:13:52,616 --> 01:13:53,731
I wanted to apologise.

903
01:13:54,117 --> 01:13:55,991
I got a bit carried away.

904
01:13:57,954 --> 01:13:59,745
Let's have a drink together later.
-Yes.

905
01:13:59,915 --> 01:14:01,658
Great idea.
-And chat a bit.

906
01:14:02,042 --> 01:14:03,620
We'll exchange numbers.

907
01:14:06,338 --> 01:14:08,247
Fine. Tonight.

908
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:10,084
What they say about Hitler

909
01:14:10,342 --> 01:14:11,753
isn't necessarily true.

910
01:14:17,808 --> 01:14:19,884
This is a rose.

911
01:14:20,811 --> 01:14:23,053
Thanks.
-Vodka for the ladies?

912
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:26,065
Gladly.
-Jörg is really nice.

913
01:14:29,611 --> 01:14:33,395
To a great evening.
Let the cards fall where they may.

914
01:14:42,332 --> 01:14:43,707
Excuse me!

915
01:14:44,543 --> 01:14:45,706
It's fine!

916
01:14:46,378 --> 01:14:47,753
I drink too much, too.

917
01:14:50,006 --> 01:14:52,758
It's the third film in a row
where I play Hitler.

918
01:14:53,135 --> 01:14:55,293
The third.
It's madness.

919
01:14:56,388 --> 01:14:59,259
The moustache bugs me.
People act weird.

920
01:14:59,516 --> 01:15:01,094
They keep me at a distance.

921
01:15:01,435 --> 01:15:03,760
Turkish gangs try it on with me
in the trams.

922
01:15:04,479 --> 01:15:07,563
I had to go for a drink with
neo-Nazis. Cheers, eh?

923
01:15:09,317 --> 01:15:11,559
I once turned down the role of Hitler.

924
01:15:12,904 --> 01:15:15,739
Sure it's her.
That's the cat-fur Alex gave her.

925
01:15:30,922 --> 01:15:32,998
Romantic.

926
01:15:37,387 --> 01:15:39,925
Sorry, I'm getting butterflies.
-Alex, can I help you?

927
01:15:43,226 --> 01:15:45,053
Vodka?
-Yes. -Another round.

928
01:15:48,899 --> 01:15:50,062
My God!

929
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:54,945
What a slut!

930
01:15:55,489 --> 01:15:58,739
Wearing Alex's jacket
and making out with someone else.

931
01:15:59,284 --> 01:16:03,068
He looked like what's-his-name,
the politician with the moustache.

932
01:16:03,789 --> 01:16:06,743
Forget it.
You already said he's a loser.

933
01:16:07,125 --> 01:16:08,584
Think I need this?

934
01:16:10,587 --> 01:16:14,288
Having a wannabe actor
trample all over me!

935
01:16:14,466 --> 01:16:18,760
And now he's screwing a fat trollop
who looks like a pregnant guinea pig.

936
01:16:20,263 --> 01:16:22,505
And she's got these inflatable lips,
too.

937
01:16:22,808 --> 01:16:25,429
Do you think they're real?
-No way!

938
01:16:25,769 --> 01:16:28,604
She looks like a duck.
-And the terrible jacket.

939
01:16:28,772 --> 01:16:30,599
It looks real porno.

940
01:16:30,816 --> 01:16:33,437
You think?
And I thought I was judgemental.

941
01:16:34,194 --> 01:16:37,777
With women who act so cheap
it's obvious what they are.

942
01:16:38,573 --> 01:16:40,482
You can do better than him.

943
01:16:40,826 --> 01:16:42,984
He will die ugly and lonely.

944
01:16:43,745 --> 01:16:45,204
He's already sorry now,

945
01:16:45,372 --> 01:16:47,828
and once he sees what a slut she is,

946
01:16:48,166 --> 01:16:51,582
he'll come crawling back to you
on his knees.

947
01:16:52,504 --> 01:16:54,378
Okay, girls. Let's split.

948
01:16:54,548 --> 01:16:56,126
It's a shithole here, anyway.

949
01:16:57,509 --> 01:16:59,087
You've got something there.

950
01:17:04,307 --> 01:17:06,300
Feeling better? I'm doing great.

951
01:17:06,643 --> 01:17:08,552
Yes, I'm fine.
-Should I take you home?

952
01:17:08,728 --> 01:17:12,393
What? No! No!
-Tell Alex your romantic story.

953
01:17:12,732 --> 01:17:14,357
Please.
-Oh, well...

954
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:17,612
It was when
I was doing non-military service.

955
01:17:18,655 --> 01:17:20,980
She spoke no German, I no Italian.

956
01:17:22,075 --> 01:17:23,866
It was a moment:

957
01:17:23,994 --> 01:17:26,034
The moon. The sea.

958
01:17:27,956 --> 01:17:31,290
Palermo.
The two of us in this run-down hotel.

959
01:17:32,002 --> 01:17:34,327
We understood each other without a word.

960
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,252
Like two dancers bound by magic.

961
01:17:37,591 --> 01:17:39,916
All I could say was ti amo.
I love you.

962
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:43,594
That's incredibly beautiful.
-Yes, well...

963
01:17:44,055 --> 01:17:48,384
As I left... I saw her beautiful face
in the moonlight.

964
01:17:49,144 --> 01:17:50,638
I wanted to live with her.

965
01:17:51,104 --> 01:17:52,563
She sounds great:

966
01:17:52,814 --> 01:17:54,094
No frivolous chat,

967
01:17:54,274 --> 01:17:56,563
doesn't mind cheap hotels...

968
01:17:56,985 --> 01:17:58,444
Wonderful, Thomas.

969
01:17:58,904 --> 01:18:01,775
You don't understand.
-What was her name again?

970
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:04,565
Search me.

971
01:18:04,743 --> 01:18:08,159
We understood each other
without small talk.

972
01:18:08,497 --> 01:18:10,905
If you wanted to live with her,

973
01:18:11,249 --> 01:18:13,040
her name might have been handy.

974
01:18:14,461 --> 01:18:19,800
The next day you did chat together
over breakfast, right?

975
01:18:20,717 --> 01:18:22,757
No. She was asleep as I left.

976
01:18:23,762 --> 01:18:27,926
What? You left during the night?
-Yes, I just said so, didn't I?

977
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:30,722
So she woke up all alone.

978
01:18:31,019 --> 01:18:32,347
Very romantic, Thomas.

979
01:18:32,813 --> 01:18:34,853
And then she paid for the room.

980
01:18:34,981 --> 01:18:36,938
Real romance, yes.

981
01:18:37,109 --> 01:18:39,315
She wanted it that way.
-Course she did!

982
01:18:39,528 --> 01:18:41,604
How would you know?.
You can't speak Italian!

983
01:18:42,906 --> 01:18:45,907
I presume she didn't think
we were engaged.

984
01:18:46,701 --> 01:18:49,239
You presume!
She hadn't understood you!

985
01:18:51,456 --> 01:18:52,736
Alex, I need a cigarette.

986
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:03,028
Well...

987
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:05,733
I'm certainly ready to marry again.

988
01:19:07,706 --> 01:19:09,663
That's incredibly sad, your story.

989
01:19:10,375 --> 01:19:13,329
I can hardly imagine
how I would have felt.

990
01:19:14,463 --> 01:19:16,503
I'd have wanted a cosy breakfast.

991
01:19:16,673 --> 01:19:18,879
And to at least exchange names.

992
01:19:19,801 --> 01:19:24,130
Yes. That's love.
Knowing what your partner's name is,

993
01:19:24,639 --> 01:19:26,762
and having an egg together
for breakfast.

994
01:19:26,933 --> 01:19:29,389
That's what life is.
That's how things are.

995
01:19:29,978 --> 01:19:32,813
This is terrible.
Really, really terrible.

996
01:19:38,653 --> 01:19:40,028
Thanks, Alex.
-Pleasure.

997
01:19:40,197 --> 01:19:41,905
You just wanted anal sex.

998
01:19:44,284 --> 01:19:46,573
Sorry?
-Yes. Be sorry.

999
01:19:48,205 --> 01:19:52,155
Wild sex used to be enough,
now they all want more.

1000
01:19:52,542 --> 01:19:54,250
Or it's you who's the prude.

1001
01:19:54,961 --> 01:19:58,579
But listen here, chum.
I don't just put out for anyone!

1002
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,757
And who's asking, anyway?

1003
01:20:02,594 --> 01:20:03,969
You've no idea at all.

1004
01:20:04,137 --> 01:20:05,300
He talks rubbish.

1005
01:20:05,514 --> 01:20:08,087
Shall we move on?
The Hugo Boss party?

1006
01:20:08,517 --> 01:20:10,426
Jörg, my mind's so full of thoughts.

1007
01:20:10,644 --> 01:20:12,553
Can I sleep over at yours?
-Sure.

1008
01:20:12,771 --> 01:20:14,265
Not at yours. Or yours!

1009
01:20:15,398 --> 01:20:16,857
Alex, I don't feel good.

1010
01:20:17,025 --> 01:20:19,481
Can I sleep at yours?
-Sure, sweetie.

1011
01:20:21,405 --> 01:20:22,864
Come on.
-One moment.

1012
01:20:23,031 --> 01:20:24,406
Okay?

1013
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:29,533
Who's paying?

1014
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,238
What a stupid story! Palermo!

1015
01:20:36,962 --> 01:20:38,919
Let me tell you something, Alex.

1016
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,797
I'm a new woman thanks to you.

1017
01:20:42,676 --> 01:20:43,956
A new...

1018
01:20:44,886 --> 01:20:47,555
and strong woman
who knows what life's about.

1019
01:20:47,806 --> 01:20:50,297
You fell!
-No, no.

1020
01:20:50,642 --> 01:20:52,433
I can manage on my own.

1021
01:20:53,103 --> 01:20:55,345
Right now...
it's important.

1022
01:20:56,273 --> 01:20:59,025
Okay.
Then I'll just go and open the door.

1023
01:21:05,490 --> 01:21:07,317
Keys are in the handbag.

1024
01:21:09,327 --> 01:21:10,869
You forgot your rose.

1025
01:21:12,205 --> 01:21:15,159
Jörg! Are you...
-Alexandra...

1026
01:21:16,626 --> 01:21:18,619
The way you grabbed me!

1027
01:21:19,296 --> 01:21:21,123
You're so passionate.

1028
01:21:21,298 --> 01:21:24,133
Alexandra, you're such a strong woman.

1029
01:21:24,301 --> 01:21:25,499
Alexandra...

1030
01:21:29,639 --> 01:21:31,964
Basti...
-Did you pick him up...

1031
01:21:32,309 --> 01:21:33,887
Well?
-Is he your boyfriend?

1032
01:21:34,352 --> 01:21:35,846
Yes.

1033
01:21:36,313 --> 01:21:37,973
I did nothing, I swear it.

1034
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:43,439
Oh, fuck!

1035
01:21:49,576 --> 01:21:51,118
Hello.

1036
01:21:51,953 --> 01:21:53,328
I'm sleeping over at yours.

1037
01:21:59,127 --> 01:22:01,452
Feeling better?
I'll be on the sofa.

1038
01:22:01,922 --> 01:22:03,630
Sorry I puked out there.

1039
01:22:04,174 --> 01:22:06,332
Forget it.
Jan does it all the time.

1040
01:22:06,843 --> 01:22:09,251
Stay with me.
I don't want to sleep alone.

1041
01:22:19,481 --> 01:22:21,189
You've got great feet.

1042
01:22:21,942 --> 01:22:23,602
Impressively large.

1043
01:22:25,195 --> 01:22:27,152
I could get used to seeing them.

1044
01:22:28,031 --> 01:22:29,573
That could be arranged.

1045
01:22:31,368 --> 01:22:35,069
You must visit me in America.
Bring your brothers, too.

1046
01:22:35,455 --> 01:22:36,783
I'm off soon.

1047
01:22:37,666 --> 01:22:39,208
What?
-Well...

1048
01:22:39,835 --> 01:22:42,373
After the last day of shooting.

1049
01:22:45,715 --> 01:22:47,838
You have to come and visit.

1050
01:22:50,178 --> 01:22:52,135
I'll miss you very much.

1051
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:56,463
Oh, God. Vodka isn't my drink.

1052
01:22:57,978 --> 01:22:59,223
Sarah...

1053
01:22:59,646 --> 01:23:02,600
Listen, I can't come and visit you.

1054
01:23:04,443 --> 01:23:07,016
Because I'm actually a man.
A man.

1055
01:23:07,404 --> 01:23:08,815
Not a woman.

1056
01:23:10,699 --> 01:23:12,110
Sarah?

1057
01:23:21,293 --> 01:23:22,918
I'll miss you badly, too.

1058
01:23:25,088 --> 01:23:27,045
I loved you but now I must go.

1059
01:23:27,215 --> 01:23:29,172
No. I need you so.

1060
01:23:29,634 --> 01:23:33,299
Don't leave me, please.
-You can't come where I am going.

1061
01:23:34,473 --> 01:23:36,679
I'm so cold, I can't feel my legs.

1062
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:40,433
You have to be happy, poppy.
You've earned it.

1063
01:23:40,937 --> 01:23:43,642
Yes?
-Our time together was so brief, but...

1064
01:23:44,107 --> 01:23:45,767
... we were happy.

1065
01:23:47,652 --> 01:23:49,027
Remember our love.

1066
01:23:55,786 --> 01:23:59,036
Our love was doomed to fail.

1067
01:24:02,042 --> 01:24:03,584
You stupid cow!

1068
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:05,917
Shut your bloody gob!

1069
01:24:25,941 --> 01:24:27,483
You did great.

1070
01:24:27,818 --> 01:24:29,396
It was really moving.

1071
01:24:29,903 --> 01:24:31,611
Where did it all come from?

1072
01:24:31,863 --> 01:24:34,069
It's all technique.
-Are you crying?

1073
01:24:34,908 --> 01:24:36,568
No, of course I'm not.

1074
01:24:37,911 --> 01:24:42,039
15 minutes to set up.
Starting... now!

1075
01:24:44,042 --> 01:24:45,869
What are you doing there...
-Shit.

1076
01:24:46,294 --> 01:24:48,999
... with the poor onions. Unbelievable!

1077
01:24:50,298 --> 01:24:54,426
The Yank won't be able to say Jürgen.
What do you think of Jeremy Hawk?

1078
01:24:55,387 --> 01:24:57,593
Cool!
-Well...

1079
01:24:58,223 --> 01:25:00,050
Sebastian. Sebastian.

1080
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:02,633
Put the doll in your room.

1081
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,147
Where's Sugar?

1082
01:25:14,322 --> 01:25:16,362
Take it all off!
Don't just stand there...

1083
01:25:16,658 --> 01:25:18,983
staring like that!
It's all full of blood.

1084
01:25:19,369 --> 01:25:20,780
Lord, yuck!

1085
01:25:21,037 --> 01:25:23,528
Where's her clean dress?
-In the warehouse.

1086
01:25:24,541 --> 01:25:28,290
Does anyone here
take care of anything at all?

1087
01:25:28,587 --> 01:25:31,790
This sucks! Wait here, sweetie.
-Okay.

1088
01:25:38,764 --> 01:25:43,971
I want a word with you.
Stop your Alexis-Colby style scheming!

1089
01:25:44,561 --> 01:25:47,681
Sarah finished with me.
I want to know why.

1090
01:25:48,023 --> 01:25:51,309
Palermo, get lost or I scream.
-No. We're talking this out,

1091
01:25:51,485 --> 01:25:53,359
man to...

1092
01:25:55,781 --> 01:25:58,237
But that's a...
-No.

1093
01:25:58,575 --> 01:26:00,153
It is!

1094
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:05,490
Thomas,
it's complex, I can't explain right now.

1095
01:26:05,624 --> 01:26:08,791
I'm asking you, as a man, please...

1096
01:26:10,629 --> 01:26:12,289
Alex?

1097
01:26:13,048 --> 01:26:14,922
I'm begging you,
I'll do anything.

1098
01:26:16,176 --> 01:26:18,382
Come on...

1099
01:26:21,348 --> 01:26:22,628
Alex, are you okay?

1100
01:26:22,974 --> 01:26:24,302
Yes, yes.

1101
01:26:25,685 --> 01:26:29,434
I've been lying to myself
about you and me.

1102
01:26:29,606 --> 01:26:30,804
What?

1103
01:26:30,982 --> 01:26:32,809
When I see you
I think to myself

1104
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:35,353
you're my best friend,

1105
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:39,615
you're honest, funny,
the most beautiful woman I know.

1106
01:26:41,785 --> 01:26:45,035
Please don't laugh at me, now.
This is new to me.

1107
01:26:47,207 --> 01:26:51,419
I mean, nowadays
it's irrelevant, anyway. Things are...

1108
01:26:51,837 --> 01:26:54,708
Men, women,
it's all so opaque, so modern.

1109
01:26:55,048 --> 01:26:58,631
When you kissed me
I should have known at once

1110
01:26:59,469 --> 01:27:00,714
something was up.

1111
01:27:05,517 --> 01:27:08,138
Alex, let us try it.
Kiss me.

1112
01:27:09,062 --> 01:27:10,722
Sleep with me.
-Stop there.

1113
01:27:10,897 --> 01:27:13,435
Alex, take a risk.
-Stop right there.

1114
01:27:15,819 --> 01:27:17,017
What's so funny?
-Shut up!

1115
01:27:17,195 --> 01:27:18,310
Me?
-No!

1116
01:27:18,488 --> 01:27:20,528
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

1117
01:27:31,543 --> 01:27:33,085
It's not what you think!

1118
01:27:34,045 --> 01:27:35,160
Okay?
-Stop it.

1119
01:27:35,922 --> 01:27:38,211
Not like that!
Oh my God!

1120
01:27:38,383 --> 01:27:40,126
Not the face. Anything but!

1121
01:27:44,431 --> 01:27:45,427
Come here!

1122
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,596
Come!

1123
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:49,556
Stop!

1124
01:28:02,074 --> 01:28:04,197
I always have bad luck with women.

1125
01:28:27,099 --> 01:28:28,807
There will be consequences.

1126
01:28:36,399 --> 01:28:37,562
You!

1127
01:28:39,444 --> 01:28:40,819
Yes.

1128
01:28:52,332 --> 01:28:54,075
That's an exaggeration.

1129
01:28:54,835 --> 01:28:57,077
Mr Honk,
with this document you undertake

1130
01:28:57,254 --> 01:28:59,875
to remain silent
about your role in the film.

1131
01:29:00,048 --> 01:29:03,084
Alexandra Honk, your creation,
will vanish forever,

1132
01:29:03,343 --> 01:29:06,878
never again to be mentioned
in conjunction with this production.

1133
01:29:07,389 --> 01:29:08,764
Hand over your wig.

1134
01:29:11,309 --> 01:29:14,429
Sign this. The bodyguards
will escort you off the premises

1135
01:29:14,688 --> 01:29:15,886
as a man.

1136
01:29:16,064 --> 01:29:20,809
The slightest failing to observe
the conditions of the contract

1137
01:29:20,986 --> 01:29:23,904
will result in a fine
of fifty million dollars.

1138
01:29:24,114 --> 01:29:26,154
I expect you won't let that happen.

1139
01:29:27,492 --> 01:29:30,826
Where would I get fifty million from?
-That solves that.

1140
01:29:31,246 --> 01:29:32,788
I'll just read this.

1141
01:29:40,547 --> 01:29:42,872
All right, all right. Fine.

1142
01:29:44,009 --> 01:29:45,420
Happy now?.

1143
01:29:46,094 --> 01:29:47,553
Really...

1144
01:29:50,307 --> 01:29:54,768
Know what? You may make films
for 50 mil, 150 mil, in 3D, whatever,

1145
01:29:55,103 --> 01:29:59,397
yet you can't even tell real tits
from fake ones.

1146
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:05,363
That's your problem.

1147
01:30:09,451 --> 01:30:10,482
Come!

1148
01:30:17,042 --> 01:30:19,082
Hey, Sis!
-It's us!

1149
01:30:19,252 --> 01:30:20,497
Ralf, come on.
-Hey!

1150
01:30:20,754 --> 01:30:23,292
Hello there.

1151
01:30:23,465 --> 01:30:25,422
Hey, wow...

1152
01:30:25,842 --> 01:30:27,669
You live here?

1153
01:30:27,844 --> 01:30:31,924
This is just for the shoot.
She lives in her suite in a hotel, hon.

1154
01:30:32,099 --> 01:30:33,641
My God!

1155
01:30:34,017 --> 01:30:35,215
What's wrong?

1156
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:37,968
Are you unwell?
-I'm better now you're here, but...

1157
01:30:38,188 --> 01:30:39,979
There's a double bed...

1158
01:30:40,607 --> 01:30:43,063
DVD, too, shower...

1159
01:30:43,235 --> 01:30:45,773
I'll tell you later.
-Basin...

1160
01:30:46,279 --> 01:30:47,477
I'll get it.
-Yes!

1161
01:30:49,116 --> 01:30:51,689
Oh, no!
I didn't recognise you like that.

1162
01:30:52,411 --> 01:30:53,691
This is Thomas Henning.

1163
01:30:54,121 --> 01:30:55,615
Henning, Thomas Henning.

1164
01:30:56,748 --> 01:30:57,993
Are you okay?
-Mostly.

1165
01:30:58,166 --> 01:31:01,369
Let's do a photo.
-Sit down with Thomas in the middle.

1166
01:31:01,670 --> 01:31:03,413
A photo. Since we're here.

1167
01:31:10,137 --> 01:31:12,177
Carlotta.
-Carlotta what?

1168
01:31:12,681 --> 01:31:15,433
That was that girl's name.
Back in Palermo.

1169
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,427
You just made that up.

1170
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:20,595
But I'm not as superficial as you think.
-Smile.

1171
01:31:23,108 --> 01:31:24,187
Super.

1172
01:31:47,132 --> 01:31:49,801
He wants to come along. He likes travel.

1173
01:31:51,470 --> 01:31:55,717
I'm freezing my tits off.
I couldn't live here anymore.

1174
01:31:56,016 --> 01:31:58,305
My feet are like ice cubes.
Moonboots?

1175
01:31:58,477 --> 01:32:01,928
Annegret, hi! It's me, Alex.
-Who?

1176
01:32:02,647 --> 01:32:03,845
Female Alex.
-You!

1177
01:32:04,483 --> 01:32:08,528
The reason I had to cancel all press!
-Where is she? Inside?

1178
01:32:08,695 --> 01:32:12,360
No. Up. Very high. In a plane.
And in five hours,

1179
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:18,989
she'll be in L.A. where she belongs, and
will have forgotten your miserable self.

1180
01:32:19,164 --> 01:32:22,200
She doesn't belong there.
-Beep-beep-beep.

1181
01:32:22,375 --> 01:32:24,831
That was the end of our conversation.

1182
01:32:26,296 --> 01:32:30,128
Get lost before the stress
makes my belly ache worse.

1183
01:32:33,386 --> 01:32:34,797
Don't you dare.

1184
01:32:35,472 --> 01:32:36,883
Don't speak to her.

1185
01:32:37,557 --> 01:32:39,633
Sarah, I know I shouldn't be here.

1186
01:32:39,976 --> 01:32:41,435
And I can't explain.

1187
01:32:42,229 --> 01:32:45,978
I have to tell you one thing.
Sarah, I've fallen in love with you.

1188
01:32:47,943 --> 01:32:49,223
This door is closed.

1189
01:33:00,539 --> 01:33:02,033
Too bad.

1190
01:33:02,499 --> 01:33:03,744
Shit is what it is!

1191
01:33:03,875 --> 01:33:07,659
We've girlified your room, cooked the
pinkel, and bought you a cocktail dress,

1192
01:33:07,796 --> 01:33:10,287
and you ruin it all.
It's totally unprofessional.

1193
01:33:10,465 --> 01:33:12,339
Unprofessional?
-I wanted to meet John.

1194
01:33:12,717 --> 01:33:15,255
Thomas betrayed me.
-Rubbish, you blew it!

1195
01:33:15,595 --> 01:33:17,006
No, it was your idol, Thomas.

1196
01:33:17,931 --> 01:33:21,763
You see how loyal actors are?
They begrudge each other everything!

1197
01:33:21,935 --> 01:33:25,553
The motor trade's the same.
It's as if money were all that mattered.

1198
01:33:26,106 --> 01:33:27,600
Money is what matters!

1199
01:33:27,941 --> 01:33:29,056
God almighty.

1200
01:33:29,401 --> 01:33:32,852
The Americans transferred 25 percent.
-And that's the lot.

1201
01:33:34,614 --> 01:33:35,777
And Sarah's gone.

1202
01:33:38,869 --> 01:33:40,660
What's that?

1203
01:33:42,330 --> 01:33:44,406
A dog.
-Oh.

1204
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:47,877
Okay. What's he doing here?
-He lives here now.

1205
01:33:48,211 --> 01:33:49,491
Or should he rent his own flat?

1206
01:33:52,758 --> 01:33:55,463
Alex, mind sleeping in my room tonight?

1207
01:33:55,677 --> 01:33:57,883
I'd like to sleep here tonight.

1208
01:33:59,181 --> 01:34:00,675
It's lovely and soft.

1209
01:34:37,094 --> 01:34:38,257
Come on.

1210
01:35:13,463 --> 01:35:15,123
It always makes me sad.

1211
01:35:16,299 --> 01:35:17,710
Me, too.

1212
01:35:18,343 --> 01:35:20,751
Maybe we'll walk the dog elsewhere.

1213
01:35:22,222 --> 01:35:24,843
Hup!
Come over here.

1214
01:35:40,365 --> 01:35:42,073
What's this?
-It was the dog.

1215
01:35:46,455 --> 01:35:49,906
Our dog can now use scissors
and cut neat corners?

1216
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:51,911
He bit it out that way.

1217
01:35:52,335 --> 01:35:55,336
Did he? Four right angles?

1218
01:35:55,964 --> 01:35:57,423
He's very talented.

1219
01:35:57,632 --> 01:35:59,921
Don't bullshit me. What was there?
-Ads.

1220
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:01,802
On the front page?

1221
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:04,131
Shit. I can't lie to him.

1222
01:36:05,223 --> 01:36:07,216
Give him the rag.

1223
01:36:16,485 --> 01:36:18,608
New Film, New Love?
St Peter-Ording.

1224
01:36:18,945 --> 01:36:21,946
Sarah Voss and Thomas Henning
shoot their second film

1225
01:36:22,199 --> 01:36:24,986
on the cosy dunes
that melt lovers' hearts.

1226
01:36:25,202 --> 01:36:27,907
Are the celebs soon to be a couple?
Shit!

1227
01:36:28,038 --> 01:36:30,244
St Peter-Ording is on the coast...

1228
01:36:30,665 --> 01:36:32,124
The North Sea.
-Know what?

1229
01:36:32,751 --> 01:36:35,324
It's round the corner. I'm off.
-Right now?.

1230
01:36:36,171 --> 01:36:37,416
We'll come along.
-What?

1231
01:36:38,048 --> 01:36:40,717
One for all,
all for one.

1232
01:36:41,009 --> 01:36:42,966
We're not the stupid musketeers!

1233
01:36:43,261 --> 01:36:45,004
Jürgen, shut it.
This is about love!

1234
01:36:48,016 --> 01:36:49,843
Fine.
Rubbeldiekatz, we'll go!

1235
01:37:21,967 --> 01:37:24,007
Why does the dog always sit up front?

1236
01:37:24,594 --> 01:37:26,468
Cause he always pukes in the back.

1237
01:37:28,265 --> 01:37:31,432
Good that I checked the van over.
It's purring like a cat.

1238
01:37:33,019 --> 01:37:35,854
140, we're doing 140.

1239
01:37:36,481 --> 01:37:38,023
We burned him off.

1240
01:37:40,652 --> 01:37:42,775
So where's the sodding sea?

1241
01:38:07,471 --> 01:38:09,179
You checked the van, yeah?

1242
01:38:09,514 --> 01:38:11,803
It's a high-mortality part. It happens.

1243
01:38:28,241 --> 01:38:29,901
Hey. There she is!

1244
01:38:32,954 --> 01:38:35,112
That spot there?
-That's her stance. Sarah!

1245
01:38:35,457 --> 01:38:36,737
Sarah!

1246
01:38:44,633 --> 01:38:47,254
I'm together with Maike now, by the way.

1247
01:39:31,346 --> 01:39:33,137
No! No!

1248
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:35,633
Don't kiss.
Sarah, don't do it.

1249
01:39:35,976 --> 01:39:37,351
Don't kiss. Okay.

1250
01:39:37,894 --> 01:39:39,519
Listen before you do it.

1251
01:39:40,939 --> 01:39:43,347
If you want to kiss this fool now,

1252
01:39:43,942 --> 01:39:47,276
you've no idea about men.
-Man, you stick like glue.

1253
01:39:47,612 --> 01:39:50,103
Shut it, Palermo, all right.
-Cool it.

1254
01:39:50,907 --> 01:39:52,781
I will now kiss Thomas.
-Why?

1255
01:39:53,368 --> 01:39:54,399
Cause it's in the script.

1256
01:39:59,958 --> 01:40:02,496
Holy shit!

1257
01:40:02,669 --> 01:40:05,160
Get this dickhead off my set!

1258
01:40:08,133 --> 01:40:09,841
Sarah, I love you.

1259
01:40:14,139 --> 01:40:15,598
I miss you so.

1260
01:40:16,016 --> 01:40:17,179
Permanently.

1261
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:19,722
I want a real relationship with you,

1262
01:40:20,187 --> 01:40:21,847
to live with you,

1263
01:40:22,105 --> 01:40:26,185
to eat boiled eggs with you...
and finally have breakfast with you.

1264
01:40:29,196 --> 01:40:30,655
I now know what it's like

1265
01:40:30,906 --> 01:40:32,863
to miss someone
who's still there.

1266
01:40:34,951 --> 01:40:36,659
Sarah, dear, I'll be in the trailer.

1267
01:40:36,995 --> 01:40:38,537
She's coming...

1268
01:40:39,998 --> 01:40:41,623
Stay cool, stay cool.
-Oh!

1269
01:40:48,757 --> 01:40:50,382
Hey, are you crazy?

1270
01:40:50,592 --> 01:40:53,213
Coming here with all your brothers
and making a scene?

1271
01:40:54,221 --> 01:40:57,092
Yes, I mean you lot!
-He just wanted to express his feelings.

1272
01:40:57,516 --> 01:40:59,674
So I should forgive you, then?

1273
01:41:00,936 --> 01:41:03,427
I...
-No, mate. I'm doing the talking.

1274
01:41:03,605 --> 01:41:05,348
How did you imagine it?
-What?

1275
01:41:05,524 --> 01:41:08,276
Your pretty fantasy
with the eggs and so on.

1276
01:41:08,443 --> 01:41:12,772
You do your light theatre performances,
then come to L.A. every two weeks?

1277
01:41:13,115 --> 01:41:14,657
Or where do you want
your eggs done?

1278
01:41:15,283 --> 01:41:16,943
A plan is what it takes.

1279
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:19,236
I know, but...
-You never have a plan.

1280
01:41:20,205 --> 01:41:22,826
Yes.
So how did you imagine it?

1281
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:31,122
I don't know, but that's the point:

1282
01:41:32,050 --> 01:41:33,959
That there are surprises in love.

1283
01:41:35,303 --> 01:41:38,221
Like in a good song.
You can't plan love.

1284
01:42:00,537 --> 01:42:03,871
There you are.
We all want to go to Entrecote.

1285
01:42:04,124 --> 01:42:05,499
The food's great.

1286
01:42:07,502 --> 01:42:08,961
Alex, eh!

1287
01:42:09,671 --> 01:42:12,376
A good guy,
but a stranger to reality.

1288
01:42:13,592 --> 01:42:15,003
Yes, he's nuts.

1289
01:42:16,386 --> 01:42:18,295
I understand you so well.

1290
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:21,088
I hate being surprised like that

1291
01:42:21,266 --> 01:42:23,342
and being ordered to be happy

1292
01:42:23,602 --> 01:42:25,642
like at a stupid
surprise birthday party.

1293
01:42:27,314 --> 01:42:30,897
What did he think?
You'd go and move in with him

1294
01:42:31,109 --> 01:42:32,769
and his stupid brothers?

1295
01:42:35,864 --> 01:42:37,192
Listen,

1296
01:42:37,574 --> 01:42:39,614
we're so similar, the two of us.

1297
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:43,661
We're far more sensitive
than normal people.

1298
01:42:44,414 --> 01:42:48,578
Only not for long periods.
But you know that now, too, right?

1299
01:42:51,797 --> 01:42:54,086
It's cold. Shall we go?

1300
01:42:58,845 --> 01:43:00,339
I've got to go.

1301
01:43:24,621 --> 01:43:26,530
So... here we are.

1302
01:43:27,290 --> 01:43:29,081
Home again.

1303
01:43:37,551 --> 01:43:39,176
Easy, now.

1304
01:43:40,053 --> 01:43:42,046
You can have plenty of others.

1305
01:43:43,098 --> 01:43:44,473
I understand you.

1306
01:43:45,434 --> 01:43:47,343
Time heals all wounds.

1307
01:43:48,478 --> 01:43:50,138
That may be.

1308
01:43:51,189 --> 01:43:52,767
But things aren't the same.

1309
01:43:56,945 --> 01:43:59,103
I can't forget her and you can't help me.

1310
01:44:08,623 --> 01:44:09,702
Will you marry me?

1311
01:44:11,126 --> 01:44:14,460
I'm taken aback.
-Then I have reason to hope?

1312
01:44:15,881 --> 01:44:17,292
I fear not, no.

1313
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:19,878
I have another wife.

1314
01:44:21,845 --> 01:44:23,921
Another wife?

1315
01:44:24,723 --> 01:44:26,929
I am another's wife!

1316
01:44:27,267 --> 01:44:29,141
We have no future.

1317
01:44:29,936 --> 01:44:31,845
I am a woman with a past.

1318
01:44:33,148 --> 01:44:35,306
But continue to have faith in love.

1319
01:44:53,919 --> 01:44:55,828
Lovely to see you again.

1320
01:44:56,546 --> 01:44:58,918
Thank you.
-And you were right again.

1321
01:44:59,257 --> 01:45:01,665
My husband is out of hospital.

1322
01:45:02,302 --> 01:45:05,137
Great. Are you well, then?
-Very.

1323
01:45:05,305 --> 01:45:09,054
You were wonderful. The play
had never moved me this much before.

1324
01:45:09,559 --> 01:45:11,967
That's thanks to you.
-Thank you.

1325
01:45:12,813 --> 01:45:15,221
For Wilma.
-Wilma, okay.

1326
01:45:16,817 --> 01:45:19,355
For Wilma...

1327
01:45:21,696 --> 01:45:22,859
Can I get a signature, too?

1328
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:28,320
For Sarah.

1329
01:45:51,184 --> 01:45:52,512
May I kiss you, too.

1330
01:45:54,271 --> 01:45:57,307
It's not really done.

1331
01:45:59,609 --> 01:46:01,020
Yes, well, but...

1332
01:46:01,570 --> 01:46:05,105
that's the point.
Even real cowards understand that.

1333
01:46:35,854 --> 01:46:38,392
Where is he?
He should be here by now.

1334
01:46:38,565 --> 01:46:40,723
Maybe he's gone boozing because...
-Why?

1335
01:46:42,778 --> 01:46:44,320
I'm hungry, I'll take two.

1336
01:46:48,617 --> 01:46:50,740
She's back!
-Sarah...

1337
01:46:51,078 --> 01:46:53,154
would like to barbeque with us.

1338
01:46:53,872 --> 01:46:56,493
Right?
-Yes. -Come on, then.

1339
01:46:58,919 --> 01:47:02,086
We've got sausages, stir fry,

1340
01:47:02,547 --> 01:47:05,465
and tofu bangers.
-Something for all palates.

1341
01:47:06,468 --> 01:47:08,508
Wow...

1342
01:47:08,678 --> 01:47:10,552
he's huge, whose is he?

1343
01:47:10,931 --> 01:47:12,888
Yours, if you'd like.

1344
01:47:13,683 --> 01:47:16,850
I didn't think he'd grow this much,
but...

1345
01:47:17,020 --> 01:47:19,807
he's yours.
-What's he called, then?

1346
01:47:20,065 --> 01:47:21,892
Honk!

1347
01:47:22,275 --> 01:47:26,225
Miss Voss, Rubbeldiekatz
was the first female at the Honk's,

1348
01:47:27,114 --> 01:47:28,988
and you are the second.
Welcome.

1349
01:47:29,366 --> 01:47:31,026
Thanks.
-Cheers!

1350
01:47:31,993 --> 01:47:33,321
Cheers!

1351
01:47:33,787 --> 01:47:38,116
Miss Voss, I still have
a picture of you. Maybe you'll sign it.

1352
01:47:38,291 --> 01:47:39,666
Yes, of course.
