1
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:12,396
16 total strangers
stand before you

2
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,333
ready to take on the most
extreme adventure ever created.

3
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,335
In this real-life
social experiment,

4
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,104
there are no games, no votes,

5
00:01:20,138 --> 00:01:22,473
and above all else, no rules.

6
00:01:22,507 --> 00:01:24,341
They may do whatever
they have to

7
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,777
to win a $500,000 prize.

8
00:01:26,812 --> 00:01:28,345
And the only way out

9
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,481
is to forfeit and go home.

10
00:01:30,515 --> 00:01:32,716
Eight hours ago,
these adventurers boarded

11
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:34,151
a private plane in London

12
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:36,020
with no knowledge
of where they were going.

13
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,455
Their adventure begins now.

14
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,059
You may remove your blindfolds.

15
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:49,834
Contestants, you are
about to participate

16
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:52,036
in an unprecedented adventure.

17
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,207
Nothing of its kind
has ever been attempted before.

18
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,708
And the playing field?

19
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,311
One of the most remote
and foreboding places

20
00:02:00,345 --> 00:02:02,179
in the world--

21
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,420
the Siberian wilderness.

22
00:02:07,185 --> 00:02:11,155
500 miles of dense woodlands
surround you in all directions.

23
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:13,119
This region of
Russia is so remote,

24
00:02:13,658 --> 00:02:15,659
that there are no roads
to connect the cities.

25
00:02:15,694 --> 00:02:18,863
Most places are only accessible
via helicopter.

26
00:02:18,897 --> 00:02:21,999
You have surrendered
all modern conveniences.

27
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:24,335
You will now attempt
to live as people did here

28
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:26,136
100 years ago.

29
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:27,605
Your goal?

30
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:31,008
To survive until
the end of winter.

31
00:02:31,042 --> 00:02:33,711
Those of you who remain
until then

32
00:02:33,745 --> 00:02:39,250
will have 500,000 dollars
to divide amongst yourselves.

33
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,652
Do whatever you need
to do to get there.

34
00:02:41,686 --> 00:02:44,221
The choice is yours.

35
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:45,890
In this experiment,
you'll be allowed

36
00:02:45,924 --> 00:02:47,224
to govern yourselves completely

37
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:49,994
with no interference
and no help.

38
00:02:50,028 --> 00:02:52,296
We will abandon you
with a camera crew

39
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,665
to document your adventure,

40
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:56,433
but the world you know
is gone--

41
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,969
slate wiped clean,
and you will start

42
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:01,138
a new civilization.

43
00:03:01,172 --> 00:03:03,207
- Are you ready to begin?
- Yes.

44
00:03:03,241 --> 00:03:04,375
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

45
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:07,478
Okay.
2 miles due east...

46
00:03:07,512 --> 00:03:09,980
are the remains
of a primitive settlement,

47
00:03:10,015 --> 00:03:11,916
an outpost where fur traders
would stop

48
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,651
to barter their wares.

49
00:03:13,685 --> 00:03:15,886
But one day in 1908,

50
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:18,322
this settlement
was found abandoned,

51
00:03:18,356 --> 00:03:21,825
fire still burning,
food still cooking in pots,

52
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,562
but its 14 inhabitants
had mysteriously disappeared,

53
00:03:25,597 --> 00:03:28,098
never to be seen again.

54
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:30,734
We've recreated this settlement
exactly as it was

55
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:32,336
100 years earlier.

56
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,005
We only hope that you don't
suffer the same fate

57
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,508
as the previous residents.

58
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:39,643
Through the woods,
red flags marked

59
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,545
the path taken
by the fur traders

60
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:42,913
to find the settlement.

61
00:03:42,948 --> 00:03:45,649
You will follow this same path.

62
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,685
However, at the end of the day,

63
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:50,087
only 14 of you will remain.

64
00:03:50,121 --> 00:03:53,791
The last two to arrive
will be sent home immediately.

65
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:56,026
So get there as quickly
as you can,

66
00:03:56,061 --> 00:03:57,428
and find yourself
a place to live,

67
00:03:57,462 --> 00:04:00,597
because this will be
your home for the duration.

68
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:05,135
Fortunately, you've all packed
for a wilderness vacation.

69
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,771
However, there is a twist.

70
00:04:07,806 --> 00:04:09,640
On this show,

71
00:04:09,674 --> 00:04:11,342
your bags will not be
joining you.

72
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,409
What?

73
00:04:12,444 --> 00:04:13,811
You will be competing

74
00:04:13,845 --> 00:04:15,546
with just the clothes
on your back.

75
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,716
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

76
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,017
Yeah.

77
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,086
Then the game has begun. Go!

78
00:04:25,457 --> 00:04:27,057
In darker times,

79
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:30,027
Siberia was the location
of the gulags,

80
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,329
prison camps that needed
no fences,

81
00:04:32,364 --> 00:04:34,365
because escape
into the formidable woods

82
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,833
was futile.

83
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:39,057
Natives named this region
The Valley Of Death.

84
00:04:39,058 --> 00:04:40,958
Tunguska is the location

85
00:04:40,972 --> 00:04:44,174
of one of the most mysterious
events in recent history.

86
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:47,177
It was feared by the locals
as a cursed place.

87
00:04:47,212 --> 00:04:49,413
This is where our contestants
will compete

88
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:50,647
to see if they have the strength

89
00:04:50,682 --> 00:04:53,550
physically and mentally
to endure.

90
00:04:53,551 --> 00:04:56,014
This is Siberia.

91
00:05:38,532 --> 00:05:41,023

92
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,082
As soon as Jonathon
said "Go"...

93
00:05:58,116 --> 00:06:00,017
I think it was a bit
late off my mark.

94
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:02,619
I was in the last position
for a quite a while,

95
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,988
so I was a little worried.

96
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:10,027
This guy's pretty fast--
uh, Johnny.

97
00:06:10,061 --> 00:06:11,795
When I looked up
and started running,

98
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,464
all I saw
was him in front of me,

99
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,799
and in my mind, I-I knew that
I had to just keep up with him

100
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,435
and not be one of the last two,
or it was game over.

101
00:06:22,574 --> 00:06:24,675
We came to this one flag,

102
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:28,445
and everyone kept on running
just the obvious path--

103
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,380
wide-open path.

104
00:06:30,415 --> 00:06:34,017
And in a game like this,
you have to

105
00:06:34,052 --> 00:06:36,253
make your own choices.

106
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,955
You choose to follow someone,

107
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:39,723
or you choose to make
your own path.

108
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:41,692
She was faster than half of
the guys out here.

109
00:06:41,726 --> 00:06:44,661
She's just kind of this--
this warrior viking princess.

110
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,930
That's one of the reasons
that I was following her.

111
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,471
Right after we dropped
the blindfolds

112
00:06:54,506 --> 00:06:56,940
and he said "Go,"
I turned around,

113
00:06:56,975 --> 00:06:59,109
just bolted and started
looking for flags

114
00:06:59,144 --> 00:07:01,445
and had one guy trailing
pretty close behind me,

115
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:04,214
but, you know, for the most
part, I whipped everyone's ass.

116
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,117
We still had all our layers on

117
00:07:07,152 --> 00:07:08,752
from being on the flight
and everything,

118
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:11,955
so it was getting hot,
and everyone was getting tired.

119
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,758
- The two boys are ahead.
- I think they took a shortcut.

120
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:16,460
Three are missing.

121
00:07:16,494 --> 00:07:18,295
You know, there's
something about Carolina.

122
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:21,431
I-I feel like I recognize her.

123
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:24,301
I just can't figure out
from where.

124
00:07:35,346 --> 00:07:38,115
When I heard, uh, Neeko
kind of fall in there,

125
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:40,484
I think he might have been
doing some laps.

126
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,788
Come on, let's go.

127
00:07:47,192 --> 00:07:50,794
I didn't exactly
start off with a bang.

128
00:07:50,828 --> 00:07:52,262
- Hey, guys.
- Guys.

129
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:53,764
Come on.

130
00:07:53,798 --> 00:07:55,899
We got a man down.

131
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,434
And, uh, I saw
that he had fallen,

132
00:07:57,468 --> 00:07:58,769
so I went back and got him.

133
00:07:58,803 --> 00:08:00,437
Try to put some pressure on it.

134
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:02,639
A little bit of pressure.

135
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:04,274
- All right, well, don't put some pressure.
- All right.

136
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:05,776
We're gonna get you there
either way.

137
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,111
I think it's really
honorable that, you know,

138
00:08:08,146 --> 00:08:10,147
he really took the time
to help someone else,

139
00:08:10,181 --> 00:08:13,283
even though it meant it could be
the end of his role in the game.

140
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:14,851
Being nice is one thing,

141
00:08:14,886 --> 00:08:17,120
but we can't forget that
this is a competition.

142
00:08:17,155 --> 00:08:21,992
Of course I was trying
to throw them off the course.

143
00:08:22,026 --> 00:08:24,228
They were just begging me
to just take it out

144
00:08:24,262 --> 00:08:25,596
and get rid of it.

145
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,130
What are you doing?
Are you allowed to do that?

146
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:28,899
We all want to win,

147
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:30,734
but we do have to play it fair.

148
00:08:30,768 --> 00:08:33,570
I believe in life you have
to play fair to win,

149
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:34,871
and then life rewards you back.

150
00:08:50,955 --> 00:08:53,323
Then I see the settlement,
and I'm like,

151
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:55,525
you know,
"touchdown, I made it."

152
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,762
And, uh, I just went
straight to one cabin.

153
00:08:58,796 --> 00:09:00,797
Taking this one here.

154
00:09:20,785 --> 00:09:22,786
I know a lot of people
are making a big mess

155
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,788
about being out here 'cause
they're all from the city,

156
00:09:24,822 --> 00:09:26,456
but, you know, I feel
kind of at ease.

157
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:28,825
I grew up on the farm
and outside,

158
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,560
so it's not really
a big deal to me.

159
00:09:30,595 --> 00:09:32,095
I kind of enjoy it, actually.

160
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:38,168
I open the door and I see,
uh, that Sabina

161
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,636
just sat down on the bed.

162
00:09:39,671 --> 00:09:41,772
I see that you got here
first, huh?

163
00:09:41,806 --> 00:09:45,008
How did she...
get here before me?

164
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,144
We had to go through mud pits.

165
00:09:47,178 --> 00:09:49,313
We had no idea
what's inside the river.

166
00:09:50,848 --> 00:09:53,684
Aah!

167
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:03,827
I don't run too fast.

168
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:06,063
The last two back at the camp
go home.

169
00:10:11,536 --> 00:10:13,470
I think we were,
like, number two or three,

170
00:10:13,504 --> 00:10:14,604
like leading the pack.

171
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:21,678
I swear I saw this rock.

172
00:10:21,713 --> 00:10:23,680
Are you sure you know
where you're going?

173
00:10:23,715 --> 00:10:24,881
I thought I was.

174
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,883
We were running.
We were on a good path.

175
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,353
But, um, we certainly
just were met

176
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:30,987
with these huge forests.

177
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:33,490
I'm pretty sure we
came this way already.

178
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,793
Okay. Let's go back.

179
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:38,762
We got lost, obviously

180
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:43,711
uh, the size is a little
disappointing but...

181
00:10:46,738 --> 00:10:49,439
- Ah!
- Whoo!

182
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:52,175
- I can't believe we made it!
- Home sweet home!

183
00:10:54,245 --> 00:10:56,079
I think we have arrived!

184
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,248
Whoo!

185
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:01,051
When I made it, I was so
incredibly relieved.

186
00:11:01,085 --> 00:11:04,154
I was so extremely
overwhelmed and happy.

187
00:11:04,188 --> 00:11:06,189
Honey, I'm home!

188
00:11:07,558 --> 00:11:09,793
Yeah, when we got there,
it was--

189
00:11:09,827 --> 00:11:12,262
it was a relief.
And then we saw the cabins,

190
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:15,065
and that was a relief, too.

191
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:16,600
It felt really good
to arrive at the settlement,

192
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:20,170
especially after our trek
there-- a huge sigh of relief.

193
00:11:20,204 --> 00:11:23,407
But also I was really impressed
with what they had given us.

194
00:11:23,441 --> 00:11:26,042
I thought maybe we might be
in huts or,

195
00:11:26,077 --> 00:11:27,978
you know, imagining
what it could look like.

196
00:11:28,012 --> 00:11:30,280
And it was a-- it's actually
a pretty self-sufficient

197
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,082
little settlement.

198
00:11:32,116 --> 00:11:33,984
I'm taking this bed
if nobody minds.

199
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:35,519
- It smells in there.
- Anything not claimed?

200
00:11:35,553 --> 00:11:38,488
- There are floors.
- I'm gonna get this one.

201
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:40,690
You made it so quick.
What's your name?

202
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:43,126
- I'm Sabina.
- Hi, Sabina. I'm Carolina.

203
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,661
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

204
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:47,063
Okay. Oh, and...

205
00:11:47,098 --> 00:11:48,532
I will take...

206
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:50,400
- I will take this one.
- Hey.

207
00:11:50,435 --> 00:11:52,135
- There are just two guys here?
- Yeah.

208
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,804
- And it's nine or ten of us?
- Uh-huh.

209
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,506
So we are missing, what,
four or five more people?

210
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,141
- Yeah, how many are we missing?
- It was-- it was 16.

211
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,177
Anybody get hurt on the way?

212
00:12:00,211 --> 00:12:02,546
- Yeah, a little bit. - The kid with
the glasses turned his, uh...

213
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,814
- Kid with the glasses?
- Yeah.

214
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,315
Couple ankle tweaks, I think.

215
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,118
Yeah, well, survival
of the fittest, right?

216
00:12:08,152 --> 00:12:10,854
One less person to worry about.

217
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:13,990
Nobody really
gave a crap except Tommy.

218
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,661
Tommy came back for me,
and I was telling him,

219
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,496
"There's no way you're gonna--

220
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,299
you're gonna carry me
all the way to this camp.

221
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,334
We don't even know how far
it is."

222
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,836
Dan had the mentality
that I was just

223
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,771
gonna leave him in a swamp
somewhere.

224
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:30,006
We don't know where we are.
Uh...

225
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,409
If I already carried
you 3/4 of a mile,

226
00:12:32,443 --> 00:12:34,678
I'm not gonna stop just because
we're at a bog

227
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,112
and leave you here now.

228
00:12:36,147 --> 00:12:37,781
I mean, I already put that
energy in.

229
00:12:37,815 --> 00:12:39,282
I'm gonna see it through.

230
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:41,384
It was just at a point where
where I was kind of realizing,

231
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:42,986
hey, we might not make it.

232
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,490
- I'm pretty sure we're lost.
- No, we're not lost.

233
00:12:46,524 --> 00:12:49,926
That was his choice. I didn't
ask him to come with me.

234
00:12:49,961 --> 00:12:51,228
Got it.

235
00:12:53,798 --> 00:12:55,565
We decided to go back.

236
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,334
We followed exactly where
all the people went.

237
00:12:57,368 --> 00:13:00,203
We looked for the flag.
There was no flag.

238
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,106
Until we actually found it.
So someone cheated

239
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,641
and took the flag
and threw it away.

240
00:13:04,675 --> 00:13:07,777
- But we found it.
- There. Come on.

241
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,148
So we're one, two--
the cocky guy.

242
00:13:12,183 --> 00:13:13,884
- This guy...
- This cabin for girls--

243
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,720
they just have six beds.
You know? We have six as well.

244
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,655
- There's two of them, and, uh...
- 'Cause we got one more--

245
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:21,625
- nine or ten. - Two more open.
Three-- two more open beds.

246
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:23,593
They'll be sleeping
on the ground.

247
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:25,161
I noticed something
that probably, uh,

248
00:13:25,196 --> 00:13:27,597
ended up helping me.
She did something.

249
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:30,066
She picked up the flag
and she tossed it.

250
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:33,637
She wasn't trying to help me
out, but inadvertently she did.

251
00:13:33,671 --> 00:13:35,472
The first rule
of the wilderness--

252
00:13:35,506 --> 00:13:37,374
- keep your feet dry.
- Right?

253
00:13:37,408 --> 00:13:39,943
Even thought it hurt,
you know, he kept--

254
00:13:39,977 --> 00:13:41,845
he kept reassuring me that,
yeah, we're still ahead,

255
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:43,213
we still got this.

256
00:13:43,247 --> 00:13:44,881
You got it.

257
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,683
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah. I got it.

258
00:13:46,717 --> 00:13:48,118
You're all right.

259
00:13:48,152 --> 00:13:51,488
She is incredibly fast.

260
00:13:51,522 --> 00:13:52,822
I-I used to play football,

261
00:13:52,857 --> 00:13:54,925
and I-I was barely
keeping up to her.

262
00:13:58,362 --> 00:13:59,763
You know what? Um...

263
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,665
- Oh, look, look, look, look, look!
- Oh, my God!

264
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:03,900
- There are two of them.
- Yay!

265
00:14:03,935 --> 00:14:05,402
I can't believe they made it!

266
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:13,431
- Oh, look, look, look. - Yay!
- There are two of them.

267
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:14,732
I can't believe they made it!

268
00:14:14,868 --> 00:14:17,602
- Will you give us some
help over here, guys? - Yeah.

269
00:14:17,636 --> 00:14:19,370
You see the camp,

270
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:22,106
and you're relieved
to be there.

271
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:25,009
Let's make it to the seat.

272
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:27,578
Why-- why don't you lift him
on that side?

273
00:14:27,613 --> 00:14:29,247
It was-- it was
a really good feeling.

274
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:30,748
It was actually like, okay,

275
00:14:30,783 --> 00:14:33,318
if I can get this ankle
healed up,

276
00:14:33,352 --> 00:14:36,087
I've got a chance to at least
make the effort.

277
00:14:36,121 --> 00:14:37,455
- Nice to see you guys.
- Thanks.

278
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:39,190
Right there-- that's
the boys' cabin.

279
00:14:39,224 --> 00:14:41,693
Um, I honestly
thought we were last.

280
00:14:41,727 --> 00:14:43,328
I figured there was a lot
of people there

281
00:14:43,362 --> 00:14:44,996
- when we got there.
- Making way. Making way.

282
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,832
- Can we clear one of these
lower beds, guys? - Yeah. Yeah.

283
00:14:50,235 --> 00:14:52,437
Careful, careful in your foot...

284
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:54,305
Yeah, he carried him
to the finish line,

285
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,642
which is, uh, in my opinion,
uh, stupid.

286
00:14:57,676 --> 00:14:59,277
Why are you gonna help
your competition?

287
00:14:59,311 --> 00:15:01,379
But, hey, I guess he's
a nice guy,

288
00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:03,381
and, you know, that's
the most important thing to him,

289
00:15:03,415 --> 00:15:05,550
but being nice isn't
gonna get you the prize.

290
00:15:05,584 --> 00:15:07,285
The money would be great,
'cause I could use it,

291
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:09,554
um, to help others, honestly.

292
00:15:09,588 --> 00:15:10,855
I would like to start
a charity,

293
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:14,158
and I think that would be
a-a good place to start.

294
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:16,427
You are gonna get the sympathy
vote the entire time.

295
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:17,829
- I mean--
- Right. Right.

296
00:15:17,863 --> 00:15:19,731
- That's-- I mean...
- I feel like I earned it.

297
00:15:19,765 --> 00:15:23,034
I think you're faking it.
It's a good idea if you are.

298
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:28,740
Is everyone here?

299
00:15:28,774 --> 00:15:30,408
Are we the last?

300
00:15:30,442 --> 00:15:32,076
I was kind of starting
to think,

301
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:34,212
hey, this might not be
good news for us.

302
00:15:34,246 --> 00:15:36,014
Where were you guys?

303
00:15:36,048 --> 00:15:37,749
I don't know. We were just
running around lost.

304
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:39,650
I had no idea where
we were going, and--

305
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:42,220
- Which way did you go?
- Ah, jeez.

306
00:15:42,254 --> 00:15:44,389
Well, when you guys all
broke off through the field,

307
00:15:44,423 --> 00:15:46,391
well, we went the other way.

308
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:48,026
And then we were just
running around in circles

309
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,627
and we couldn't even
find the flag.

310
00:15:49,661 --> 00:15:51,796
And when we did find it,
it was on the ground.

311
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,498
Aw.

312
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:55,199
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

313
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:57,835
When I found out that we were
the last two people there

314
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,705
and we were getting eliminated,
I was-- I was angry.

315
00:16:00,739 --> 00:16:03,041
I was totally angry
and upset because, you know,

316
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:05,676
I've been waiting months
to get on this show.

317
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:07,512
And I didn't plan on
leaving the first week.

318
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:09,380
I'm a competitor.

319
00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:12,517
I work hard and-- and I never
give up on anything.

320
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:14,185
We were just running
around in circles, man.

321
00:16:14,219 --> 00:16:15,520
That's all we were doing.

322
00:16:15,554 --> 00:16:17,555
After traveling and, uh,

323
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:19,991
coming all this way
and planning and--

324
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:22,627
and all that, um...

325
00:16:22,661 --> 00:16:24,262
yeah, it's disappointing.

326
00:16:35,908 --> 00:16:37,442
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

327
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:39,744
I see you all made it
in one piece.

328
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:42,013
Can I get everybody to come
around here real quick?

329
00:16:42,047 --> 00:16:43,681
I just want to have
a chat with you all.

330
00:16:47,052 --> 00:16:49,420
First off, I want to
congratulate you all

331
00:16:49,455 --> 00:16:52,023
for making it to your new home.

332
00:16:52,057 --> 00:16:55,293
Unfortunately, two of you
weren't so lucky.

333
00:16:55,327 --> 00:16:57,795
As would have happened
a hundred years ago,

334
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,363
some settlers would have died
or been injured

335
00:16:59,398 --> 00:17:02,366
on their way and never made it
to this remote outpost.

336
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:05,269
Berglind, Harpreet,
please step forward.

337
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:10,074
Say good-bye to your friends.
You're going home.

338
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:16,347
Win that money, man.

339
00:17:16,381 --> 00:17:17,482
Good luck.

340
00:17:17,483 --> 00:17:18,583
Bye.

341
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,852
It's a total bummer, like...

342
00:17:20,886 --> 00:17:22,386
If I could go back,
I swear to God

343
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:23,921
I would have stuck
with the pack,

344
00:17:23,956 --> 00:17:26,124
but you can't go back in time,
unfortunately,

345
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:28,726
so I'm just gonna have to keep
pushing forward.

346
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,228
I did my best,

347
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:33,564
so, um... it was a decision
I took.

348
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,734
I went. I-I went
in the opposite direction.

349
00:17:36,768 --> 00:17:38,369
But it was my decision.

350
00:17:38,403 --> 00:17:40,338
You know, you always want
to win, of course.

351
00:17:40,372 --> 00:17:43,908
But if you don't,
you just gotta take it

352
00:17:43,942 --> 00:17:45,776
and walk away with pride.

353
00:17:45,811 --> 00:17:48,479
For the 14 of you who remain,

354
00:17:48,514 --> 00:17:50,681
this village will be your home

355
00:17:50,716 --> 00:17:52,950
for as long as you can bear it.

356
00:17:52,985 --> 00:17:54,752
Behind me is the Revealer.

357
00:17:54,786 --> 00:17:56,521
Periodically, it will open,

358
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:58,356
and it will grant you an item

359
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,191
that will aid in your survival.

360
00:18:00,225 --> 00:18:03,027
How you use this item,
or who possesses it,

361
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:05,263
is completely up to you.

362
00:18:05,297 --> 00:18:08,032
If you wish to leave,
or if you need help,

363
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:10,067
just down that path

364
00:18:10,102 --> 00:18:12,503
where Harpreet and Berglind
just walked to,

365
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:14,472
there is a safe zone
with a button

366
00:18:14,506 --> 00:18:16,507
that will summon a helicopter.

367
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:18,943
Once you cross the line
of the safe zone,

368
00:18:18,977 --> 00:18:22,480
you are out, and have
forfeited the competition.

369
00:18:22,514 --> 00:18:26,217
But just remember, there are
no support staff on site.

370
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:28,286
The only way to get help

371
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,590
is to go to safe zone
and press that button.

372
00:18:32,624 --> 00:18:34,859
That is the only rule.

373
00:18:34,893 --> 00:18:37,395
There are no other rules
on this show.

374
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:40,431
Settlers, welcome to Siberia.

375
00:18:42,801 --> 00:18:46,304
I wish there was
a couple more rules, honestly,

376
00:18:46,338 --> 00:18:48,005
but at the same time,

377
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,675
if that's what we signed up for
with no rules,

378
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:52,109
then that's what it is,

379
00:18:52,144 --> 00:18:54,745
so I-I don't really
feel bad about it.

380
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,950
I feel like I've got, like,
a little bit of an upper hand

381
00:18:58,984 --> 00:19:01,686
in... a lot of ways.

382
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,387
Um...

383
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:05,022
just because I don't think
other people

384
00:19:05,057 --> 00:19:07,258
are willing to do
what I'm willing to do.

385
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:09,060
I'm not the kind of guy
that's gonna go

386
00:19:09,094 --> 00:19:10,728
attack somebody
or steal something.

387
00:19:10,762 --> 00:19:13,831
I'm gonna try to be fair
to my fellow man,

388
00:19:13,865 --> 00:19:15,199
I guess you could say.

389
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:17,101
Well, for myself,
I'm a little shy,

390
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:19,136
and so it's hard for me
to make alliances.

391
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:21,372
You know... I can't get
"voted out."

392
00:19:21,406 --> 00:19:24,342
No rules kind of has
a double-sided meaning to me.

393
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:26,844
It's exciting because
anything can happen.

394
00:19:26,878 --> 00:19:29,280
For him to say
"no rules," basically that means

395
00:19:29,314 --> 00:19:31,582
you have to keep an eye
on everything, in a sense,

396
00:19:31,617 --> 00:19:33,851
so you're in charge
of your own food,

397
00:19:33,885 --> 00:19:36,020
you're in charge of
your own clothing. Everything.

398
00:19:36,054 --> 00:19:40,258
It's just on you, without anyone
there to tell you yes or no.

399
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:41,525
And that's gonna be kind of hard

400
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,828
when it comes to arguments,

401
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:46,831
because there isn't someone
who has the rulebook

402
00:19:46,865 --> 00:19:48,833
in their hand to tell you
what's what.

403
00:19:48,867 --> 00:19:51,035
We don't want
a "Lord Of The Flies" situation

404
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:53,104
on our hands.

405
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:56,774
- Six beds, right?
- There's only six beds.

406
00:19:56,808 --> 00:19:58,409
Someone has to sleep
on the floor.

407
00:19:58,443 --> 00:20:00,344
I'm not sleeping on the floor.
I'm just saying that.

408
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:01,879
I'm just putting it out there
straightaway.

409
00:20:01,913 --> 00:20:04,615
I was just like,
nuh-unh-unh.

410
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,584
That's not gonna happen.

411
00:20:06,618 --> 00:20:09,287
I think it's fair that
the people who got here first

412
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:11,956
can stay, and the person
who doesn't can,

413
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,924
you know, compromise.

414
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:16,527
Because I think you were out,
you know, talking to people,

415
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:18,429
which isn't a problem,
there's nothing wrong with that,

416
00:20:18,463 --> 00:20:21,132
but... but then you can't
expect to just come in

417
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,267
at the last minute
and still get a spot.

418
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:26,003
Did everyone hear me?
Did everyone hear me then

419
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:28,272
clearly saying I'm not
sleeping on the floor?

420
00:20:28,307 --> 00:20:30,975
- I'm not sleeping on the floor.
- Well, someone has to sleep on the floor.

421
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:32,710
Well, it's not
gonna be me, so...

422
00:20:32,744 --> 00:20:34,178
Why wouldn't it be you?

423
00:20:34,212 --> 00:20:36,080
She got a little bit
upset at her.

424
00:20:36,114 --> 00:20:39,183
Um, I guess Esther's not used
to sleeping on the floor.

425
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:41,285
I don't think it would have
been such a big deal.

426
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,087
At least we're sleeping
somewhere

427
00:20:43,121 --> 00:20:44,655
and not just out in the woods.

428
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,891
You said whoever gets here
first should have the bed,

429
00:20:46,925 --> 00:20:49,193
and I was here first.
So, what? You don't believe me?

430
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:51,729
Well, the thing is, no one
saw you get here first.

431
00:20:51,763 --> 00:20:53,230
Did-- I mean, did any
of you guys--

432
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:55,066
I mean, I didn't see--
I didn't see you walk in.

433
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,934
If everyone thinks it's okay
to sleep on the floor,

434
00:20:56,968 --> 00:21:00,738
then, please, volunteer, but
I'm not sleeping on the floor.

435
00:21:00,772 --> 00:21:02,406
I... I mean,

436
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:04,241
you're just gonna have
to compromise this one time.

437
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:06,544
I'm not sleeping
on the floor, honey.

438
00:21:06,578 --> 00:21:09,447
Look, you know what? This has
been a lovely bonding session.

439
00:21:09,481 --> 00:21:12,316
I think I'm gonna see if there's
some room with the guys, so...

440
00:21:12,351 --> 00:21:15,086
Just don't push me too far.

441
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,554
And I felt really bad
for Irene,

442
00:21:16,588 --> 00:21:19,423
because she was just trying
to defend herself.

443
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,293
It seems like Esther's
a strong personality

444
00:21:22,327 --> 00:21:24,929
and sort of came at her
a little bit,

445
00:21:24,963 --> 00:21:27,098
and when she decided-- Esther
just decided to leave

446
00:21:27,132 --> 00:21:28,899
and go sleep with the boys,

447
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:32,203
poor Irene just kind of
broke down a little bit.

448
00:21:32,237 --> 00:21:34,739
You don't have to
feel bad, okay?

449
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:38,042
I'm just, like-- it's, like,
the first couple days,

450
00:21:38,076 --> 00:21:39,643
and I don't want to make
any enemies.

451
00:21:39,678 --> 00:21:41,145
- No, don't worry.
- Don't worry.

452
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:43,214
- I mean--
- I'm pissed off. I mean, I'm--

453
00:21:43,248 --> 00:21:44,548
- I-- if it was me...
- I know, right?

454
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,050
I would offer to share a bed.

455
00:21:46,084 --> 00:21:47,451
And we still have a situation.

456
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:49,286
Like, we have six beds, too,
and seven guys.

457
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:50,955
What'd you do?

458
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:52,523
Well, I don't--
I have my bed.

459
00:21:52,557 --> 00:21:53,924
I marked my bed
as soon as we came in.

460
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:56,694
You want-- you want to
sleep in my bed?

461
00:21:56,728 --> 00:21:59,397
- Would you let me sleep in your--
- Well, I would have to--

462
00:21:59,431 --> 00:22:02,032
- I promise I will... I will behave.
- No touching?

463
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:04,235
Me and Esther--
first of all, I think she's hot.

464
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:07,204
That's why I'm kind of proud
that she's-- she chose me

465
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,305
to share a bed with.

466
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,041
I just want other boys
to see that.

467
00:22:11,076 --> 00:22:12,843
I want them to be jealous.

468
00:22:12,878 --> 00:22:16,013
That means they're gonna be
emotional and weaker.

469
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:18,516
Did you check the water
in the barrels over there?

470
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,917
- No, there was--
- No water?

471
00:22:19,951 --> 00:22:21,085
- That's just dry.
- They're empty?

472
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,353
Yeah, we're gonna have to
go looking.

473
00:22:22,387 --> 00:22:25,523
Maybe they--

474
00:22:38,931 --> 00:22:41,299
Yeah, there's this box thing

475
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,767
that we were told about,

476
00:22:42,802 --> 00:22:44,435
and it reveals things.

477
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,771
Oh, yeah, they're
gonna give us something here.

478
00:22:46,806 --> 00:22:49,073
Every time I get excited
thinking it's gonna be food.

479
00:22:49,108 --> 00:22:51,042
- I hope it's a treat.
- Mm-hmm. Maybe water.

480
00:22:51,076 --> 00:22:52,477
A watery treat.

481
00:22:52,511 --> 00:22:55,013
It looks like a Halloween box

482
00:22:55,047 --> 00:22:57,849
in the middle of some
horror movie. Um...

483
00:22:57,883 --> 00:22:59,551
It looks pretty strong, though.

484
00:22:59,585 --> 00:23:01,052
Do we have to
open it or something?

485
00:23:01,086 --> 00:23:02,554
At first, we had to, like,
beat on it a little bit.

486
00:23:02,588 --> 00:23:04,088
We didn't know what it was.

487
00:23:06,692 --> 00:23:07,926
What was that?

488
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,128
- Look, there--
- Hey, hey, hey.

489
00:23:10,162 --> 00:23:11,663
- There you go!
- Guys.

490
00:23:11,697 --> 00:23:14,065
Good lookin' out.

491
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:15,700
What does it say?

492
00:23:15,734 --> 00:23:18,970
"The fly agaric is a mushroom
native to Siberia.

493
00:23:19,004 --> 00:23:21,639
It is consumed by the local
Evenki natives

494
00:23:21,674 --> 00:23:24,409
and was long used in their
shamanic rituals."

495
00:23:24,443 --> 00:23:25,777
I think it was, like,
our first clue

496
00:23:25,811 --> 00:23:27,312
to a food source.

497
00:23:27,346 --> 00:23:30,815
"This important foodstuff
is plentiful in the region,

498
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,051
but beware...

499
00:23:33,085 --> 00:23:36,788
because these mushrooms
are poisonous unless boiled."

500
00:23:36,822 --> 00:23:39,357
- Great.
- I hate mushrooms.

501
00:23:39,391 --> 00:23:41,960
Yeah, someone saw mushrooms
down the walk...

502
00:23:41,994 --> 00:23:44,562
But they were like this-- they
were, like, the size of an ant.

503
00:23:44,597 --> 00:23:46,698
That's not gonna feed us.

504
00:23:46,732 --> 00:23:48,132
They were tiny.

505
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:50,201
I feel like if there's not
a leader of the group,

506
00:23:50,236 --> 00:23:52,237
we're all-- we're all done.
We're done.

507
00:23:52,271 --> 00:23:54,072
Did they look like that?
Who saw them on the walk?

508
00:23:54,106 --> 00:23:56,207
- Hold on, hold on. Guys.
- Hey, guys.

509
00:23:56,242 --> 00:23:57,876
I don't care. He can
talk to anybody he wants,

510
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,510
tell them what to do,
and that's-- that's up to them.

511
00:23:59,545 --> 00:24:01,813
I don't-- he can tell me what
to do, but I ain't gonna do it.

512
00:24:01,847 --> 00:24:03,181
- We split, or let's go
together to get... - Wood, fire...

513
00:24:03,215 --> 00:24:04,315
Who wants to do mushrooms?

514
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,717
- Mushrooms.
- I will.

515
00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:07,886
I'm happy to take
the leadership position.

516
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,555
Coming out here now and being
thrown in this situation--

517
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:12,323
it's-- it's like second nature
for me

518
00:24:12,358 --> 00:24:14,893
just to always jump ahead
and take that stand.

519
00:24:14,927 --> 00:24:16,327
Water comes first for me.

520
00:24:16,362 --> 00:24:18,730
Fire is-- is pretty much
number two.

521
00:24:18,764 --> 00:24:20,398
And a lot of the people
in the camp were like,

522
00:24:20,432 --> 00:24:21,900
"Why do you gotta boil water?"

523
00:24:21,934 --> 00:24:23,234
And if you don't boil
your water,

524
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:25,236
you want-- you want parasites
inside of you?

525
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:26,938
They'll knock you out
of this race.

526
00:24:26,972 --> 00:24:28,473
They might even kill you.

527
00:24:28,507 --> 00:24:31,142
- Have you made one before?
- Long time ago.

528
00:24:31,176 --> 00:24:32,510
Boy scouts.

529
00:24:32,544 --> 00:24:34,012
You know, I'd start a fire
back in the day.

530
00:24:34,046 --> 00:24:35,813
I thought I remembered it
better than I did.

531
00:24:35,848 --> 00:24:37,415
- 'Cause I don't see this being...
- You do a hole...

532
00:24:37,449 --> 00:24:39,284
- Useful.
- It fits the wood, then you spin it around

533
00:24:39,318 --> 00:24:41,119
some of this tinder.

534
00:24:41,153 --> 00:24:43,855
Sometimes I exaggerate,
or lie-- whatever.

535
00:24:46,392 --> 00:24:47,659
Hold it underneath.

536
00:24:49,762 --> 00:24:51,663
Rubbing two sticks
together making a fire--

537
00:24:51,697 --> 00:24:53,031
it's not like "The Flintstones"

538
00:24:53,065 --> 00:24:55,199
where you do it
and it just happens,

539
00:24:55,234 --> 00:24:57,869
so I guess a bunch
of people were getting going

540
00:24:57,903 --> 00:24:59,370
with the sticks, trying to get
a fire started,

541
00:24:59,405 --> 00:25:01,205
and again, mushrooms, water--

542
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,207
if you don't have the third
piece of the triangle--

543
00:25:03,242 --> 00:25:05,476
the tri-force--
you can't eat.

544
00:25:05,511 --> 00:25:07,712
You can't drink.

545
00:25:07,746 --> 00:25:09,948
Everything was
confiscated, apparently,

546
00:25:09,982 --> 00:25:12,083
and I guess whatever
I could sneak in my boot,

547
00:25:12,117 --> 00:25:14,819
they didn't really do
a frisk-search like they do

548
00:25:14,853 --> 00:25:18,423
before you go into a cop car,
so I managed to sneak in...

549
00:25:18,457 --> 00:25:22,393
my own fire starter.

550
00:25:22,428 --> 00:25:23,761
Ahh!

551
00:25:26,031 --> 00:25:28,833
- Yeah!
- Go get mushrooms! We got water.

552
00:25:28,867 --> 00:25:32,603
Miljan, Tommy, and I went out
to look for mushrooms.

553
00:25:32,638 --> 00:25:35,807
Um, we didn't find mushrooms,
but we found a river,

554
00:25:35,841 --> 00:25:37,909
and that was a nice bit
of relief.

555
00:25:37,943 --> 00:25:41,012
No, I-I know. Like,
you get used to it.

556
00:25:41,046 --> 00:25:42,680
Oh, this feels so nice.

557
00:25:42,715 --> 00:25:44,449
This feels so nice.

558
00:25:44,483 --> 00:25:45,450
Come on, Esther. Don't you
want to get wet?

559
00:25:45,484 --> 00:25:47,018
I haven't got any other
clothes.

560
00:25:47,052 --> 00:25:49,921
I thought girls like you would
want to get wet.

561
00:25:49,955 --> 00:25:51,856
He's weird.
He's a funny one,

562
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:55,059
but our sense of humor--
we-- we just click.

563
00:25:55,094 --> 00:25:57,462
Here's two groups
trying to make fire.

564
00:25:57,496 --> 00:26:00,031
I mean, we're there with all--
collecting wood,

565
00:26:00,065 --> 00:26:02,700
we're-- we're struggling,
and he's just there chilling.

566
00:26:02,735 --> 00:26:03,868
Don't you want to help?

567
00:26:03,902 --> 00:26:05,036
I mean, all the guys
are helping.

568
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,371
The girls are helping.

569
00:26:06,405 --> 00:26:07,538
There's a group
that's out there

570
00:26:07,573 --> 00:26:09,007
just looking for food for us,

571
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:10,375
and you're just chilling here.

572
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:12,710
They're not
looking food for me.

573
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:14,779
I can take care of myself.

574
00:26:14,813 --> 00:26:16,447
I'm not trying to help
everyone else

575
00:26:16,482 --> 00:26:18,616
because, uh, at the end
of the game,

576
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:21,352
I want to be the last one
standing, which means

577
00:26:21,387 --> 00:26:24,088
there's less people that I have
to split the money with.

578
00:26:24,123 --> 00:26:26,190
You know, I don't really
need their help.

579
00:26:26,225 --> 00:26:28,593
I'm self-sufficient
on my own.

580
00:26:30,129 --> 00:26:31,429
I'm self-sufficient
because, uh...

581
00:26:31,463 --> 00:26:34,332
no rules, right?

582
00:26:36,802 --> 00:26:38,770
Johnny seems to be
one of those guys

583
00:26:38,804 --> 00:26:40,471
that is all "me, me, me."

584
00:26:40,506 --> 00:26:42,140
I don't like Johnny.

585
00:26:42,174 --> 00:26:45,476
I don't even call him Johnny.
He's "Country Boy."

586
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:48,946
The whole thing with Country Boy
is he's not playing by

587
00:26:48,981 --> 00:26:51,382
the rules of the land.

588
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:53,117
The rules of the land
is everybody right now

589
00:26:53,152 --> 00:26:54,852
has to do something.

590
00:26:54,887 --> 00:26:56,654
As far as the "no rules,"
that's just, uh,

591
00:26:56,688 --> 00:26:58,356
that's what the producers

592
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,224
and the reality show set up,

593
00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:01,759
that there's no rules.

594
00:27:01,794 --> 00:27:03,494
Oh, but there's rules.

595
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:06,397
And people need to adhere
to them.

596
00:27:06,432 --> 00:27:09,200
Everyone's doing stuff
to try to survive at least,

597
00:27:09,234 --> 00:27:11,769
and he's just like,
"Nope. I'm tanning."

598
00:27:11,804 --> 00:27:13,871
I mean, what the hell is that?

599
00:27:13,906 --> 00:27:16,140
Yeah, you know, I'm working
on my tan. I'm doing it for her.

600
00:27:16,175 --> 00:27:18,376
You know?
She'll appreciate it later.

601
00:27:20,913 --> 00:27:22,547
- Oh, my God, it's working!
- Oh, my God.

602
00:27:22,581 --> 00:27:24,415
- Oh, my God, it's working!
- Yeah.

603
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,350
- Oh, God, that's-- I see it.
- Come on, come on.

604
00:27:26,385 --> 00:27:29,187
- There you go. You got it.
- I think it's gonna work. It's gonna work.

605
00:27:29,221 --> 00:27:30,455
Stand it up.

606
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:32,657
You got this!

607
00:27:32,691 --> 00:27:35,493
- Just let it go.
- Keep blowing. Keep-- ooh. Keep it.

608
00:27:35,527 --> 00:27:36,627
Blow.

609
00:27:36,662 --> 00:27:38,296
Keep going, keep going.
Come on.

610
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:42,366
Come on, come on.

611
00:27:42,401 --> 00:27:43,968
Oh...

612
00:27:44,002 --> 00:27:45,837
No, we're gonna lose it--
lose it.

613
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:48,039
- You blow on it. - No, not-- not
too much, or we'll blow it out.

614
00:27:48,073 --> 00:27:50,541
Don't blow it out. That's fine.

615
00:27:50,576 --> 00:27:53,478
Hero of the day was Dan,
my man. Uh...

616
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:56,047
I guess there was some reason
why I had to have carried him

617
00:27:56,081 --> 00:27:57,582
all that way.

618
00:27:57,616 --> 00:27:59,117
Yeah, it was a really cool
moment.

619
00:27:59,151 --> 00:28:01,853
I-I did-- it-- for the first time
in the camp,

620
00:28:01,887 --> 00:28:04,555
I felt like I finally
got some...

621
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:08,159
some respect, which I wasn't--
I wasn't getting at all.

622
00:28:08,193 --> 00:28:09,393
Yeow!

623
00:28:11,063 --> 00:28:13,631
Dan, Danny, Danno--
uh, he's a cool guy.

624
00:28:13,665 --> 00:28:17,168
Starting the bonfire with his--
with his glasses? Genius.

625
00:28:17,202 --> 00:28:19,003
None of us would have thought--
thought of that, you know?

626
00:28:19,037 --> 00:28:21,739
So he instantly gained
my respect

627
00:28:21,773 --> 00:28:24,208
from just-- from just
that one moment.

628
00:28:24,243 --> 00:28:25,710
We have a lot of water.

629
00:28:25,744 --> 00:28:27,478
- No mushrooms?
- But we found water.

630
00:28:27,513 --> 00:28:29,647
- We found water just fine. No mushrooms.
- We've got water!

631
00:28:29,681 --> 00:28:30,948
Water's the most
important thing.

632
00:28:30,983 --> 00:28:32,416
We can live days
without food, but...

633
00:28:32,451 --> 00:28:34,485
- You guys got water?
- We got water.

634
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,053
Oh, my God!

635
00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:37,622
- Hey! Everybody!
- What's up?

636
00:28:37,656 --> 00:28:39,223
They went to get mushrooms

637
00:28:39,258 --> 00:28:40,992
and they came back without mushrooms.

638
00:28:41,026 --> 00:28:42,627
- But they got water!
- Why'd you come back?

639
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:44,128
Well, now you gotta go
back out again.

640
00:28:44,163 --> 00:28:46,164
- You gotta get the mushrooms.
- There is none.

641
00:28:46,198 --> 00:28:48,799
I was just like, come on.
Seriously?

642
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:50,401
Sam... yeah.

643
00:28:50,435 --> 00:28:52,303
Sam and I probably
wouldn't be friends.

644
00:28:52,337 --> 00:28:55,473
When I get hungry,
I get a little mean.

645
00:28:55,507 --> 00:28:57,208
I get a little ornery.

646
00:28:57,242 --> 00:28:58,910
And that's not a good thing.

647
00:28:58,944 --> 00:29:00,578
They wouldn't have given us
a clue that there was mushrooms

648
00:29:00,612 --> 00:29:02,513
- unless there was!
- Give me a minute. Just give me a minute.

649
00:29:02,548 --> 00:29:04,582
The mushrooms-- we can
find mushrooms tomorrow.

650
00:29:04,616 --> 00:29:06,551
The most important thing--
we got fire and water.

651
00:29:06,585 --> 00:29:08,619
- You can survive till-- - And what
are you gonna do in the meantime?

652
00:29:08,654 --> 00:29:11,989
Watching Sam arguing,
just bark at people,

653
00:29:12,024 --> 00:29:13,524
was, uh, pretty funny.

654
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:14,992
I-I can tell you that they're
gonna get sick of that.

655
00:29:15,027 --> 00:29:18,563
Just the first day,
trying to start a fire,

656
00:29:18,597 --> 00:29:22,500
took us forever, and...
we haven't even

657
00:29:22,534 --> 00:29:24,101
found food yet.

658
00:29:24,136 --> 00:29:26,304
So I...

659
00:29:26,338 --> 00:29:28,372
It's a little worrying.

660
00:29:29,942 --> 00:29:31,943
I was thinking about that.

661
00:29:31,977 --> 00:29:34,145
What's up, girl?
Go.

662
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:35,680
- I didn't...
- Oh, I see.

663
00:29:35,714 --> 00:29:37,748
...officially bring anything.

664
00:29:37,783 --> 00:29:39,550
What does that mean?

665
00:29:39,585 --> 00:29:41,252
- Well, you know how they--
- They took our bags.

666
00:29:41,286 --> 00:29:44,355
- Yeah. Um...
- Did you smuggle in some stuff?

667
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:46,557
Yeah, I did, actually.

668
00:29:46,592 --> 00:29:47,925
A constant question--

669
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,594
is this person being real
with me?

670
00:29:49,628 --> 00:29:52,363
Because I know I'm...
I'm censoring things,

671
00:29:52,397 --> 00:29:55,766
I'm filtering things for
the sake of this competition.

672
00:29:55,801 --> 00:29:58,102
So where is everybody from?

673
00:29:58,136 --> 00:30:00,571
I am from Montenegro,

674
00:30:00,606 --> 00:30:02,773
right across from Italy,
on the Adriatic Sea,

675
00:30:02,808 --> 00:30:04,175
next to Croatia.

676
00:30:04,209 --> 00:30:05,643
- It's a small--
- I like your accent.

677
00:30:05,677 --> 00:30:06,744
- Yeah, me, too.
- Thank you.

678
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:08,079
It's really exotic.

679
00:30:08,113 --> 00:30:09,547
I don't know Miljan that well.

680
00:30:09,581 --> 00:30:11,949
He's always making jokes,
trying to keep things light.

681
00:30:11,984 --> 00:30:13,651
I just don't trust him.

682
00:30:13,685 --> 00:30:15,253
I don't trust Miljan.

683
00:30:15,287 --> 00:30:17,455
We don't really know
anything about each other.

684
00:30:17,489 --> 00:30:20,691
We're just starting to know
each other now a little bit.

685
00:30:20,726 --> 00:30:22,560
What about you, Daniel?

686
00:30:22,594 --> 00:30:26,397
I'm from a very, very
small town in Minnesota.

687
00:30:26,431 --> 00:30:28,833
- What do you?
- Well, I work a lot with computers.

688
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:30,167
So...

689
00:30:30,202 --> 00:30:31,802
He's joined us.
Hello.

690
00:30:31,837 --> 00:30:33,504
- Oh. Hello.
- How's it going, guys?

691
00:30:33,538 --> 00:30:36,040
Oh! Maybe we should
speak to him.

692
00:30:36,074 --> 00:30:37,875
Pull up a seat.

693
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:40,111
- Here, come sit.
- You can tell us your life story.

694
00:30:40,145 --> 00:30:41,812
- Is that what we're on now,
our life stories? - Yep.

695
00:30:41,847 --> 00:30:43,347
Mm-hmm.

696
00:30:43,382 --> 00:30:45,116
- You guys hungry at all?
- Oh, I'm starving.

697
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,717
- Yeah.
- Very hungry.

698
00:30:46,752 --> 00:30:48,786
I picked, uh, some berries
in a berry patch I found.

699
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,621
- It's not much, so...
- Oh.

700
00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:52,156
- Oh.
- Oh-ho-ho.

701
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,557
But, uh, if you guys want
a little treat,

702
00:30:53,592 --> 00:30:55,126
I was gonna pass it around.

703
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,694
- Yeah. That's nice.
- Very nice of you.

704
00:30:56,728 --> 00:30:58,229
- Have you tried one?
- Yeah.

705
00:30:58,263 --> 00:30:59,997
- Are they poi--
- And they're okay?

706
00:31:00,032 --> 00:31:01,132
They're not poisonous.

707
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:04,001
All right--
are you sure?

708
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,971
I'm just kidding.

709
00:31:07,005 --> 00:31:08,539
Johnny is
very interesting to me.

710
00:31:08,573 --> 00:31:10,775
He seems very cocky.
He has some problems.

711
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:12,343
He's a little bit asocial.

712
00:31:12,377 --> 00:31:13,811
I'm gonna break him slowly.

713
00:31:13,845 --> 00:31:15,046
So what do you do?

714
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,717
Um, I've spent the majority
of my, uh,

715
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:21,519
adult years as a model.

716
00:31:21,553 --> 00:31:23,354
So I've lived--
I was born in Australia,

717
00:31:23,388 --> 00:31:27,291
but I've lived... mm,
in many countries, traveling--

718
00:31:28,593 --> 00:31:30,795
- Oh, my God.
- What is that?

719
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:32,596
What is that?

720
00:31:40,213 --> 00:31:41,713
Maybe we should go
we should go inside.

721
00:31:41,748 --> 00:31:43,515
- What is that?
- It's probably just a bear.

722
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,217
I don't know, man. That didn't
sound like a bear to me.

723
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:47,352
- We can't leave the fire--
- Wait, wait. Shh, shh!

724
00:31:47,387 --> 00:31:48,387
What was that?

725
00:31:48,421 --> 00:31:49,454
Oh, my God!

726
00:31:49,489 --> 00:31:50,522
Oh, my God!

727
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,897
Get in.

728
00:31:58,932 --> 00:32:00,899
- Sam, can you come with us?
- Huh?

729
00:32:00,934 --> 00:32:03,101
- Can you come with us?
- Just go. Yeah, just go.

730
00:32:03,136 --> 00:32:04,703
- Can you come with us?
- Just go, just--

731
00:32:14,113 --> 00:32:16,882
There was this crazy sound
that came out of the woods,

732
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:18,850
and it was like a...
I don't know,

733
00:32:18,885 --> 00:32:20,619
like a growl or something.

734
00:32:20,653 --> 00:32:22,854
I work with animals,
and I've never heard

735
00:32:22,889 --> 00:32:24,890
an animal like that before.

736
00:32:25,888 --> 00:32:27,873
_

737
00:32:30,811 --> 00:32:33,395
_

738
00:32:36,818 --> 00:32:39,615
_

739
00:32:40,506 --> 00:32:45,344
I have absolutely no idea
what happened last night.

740
00:32:45,378 --> 00:32:46,478
Zero.

741
00:32:46,512 --> 00:32:48,981
It really scared me.
I mean, of course.

742
00:32:49,015 --> 00:32:50,349
We're in Siberia, and there's--

743
00:32:50,383 --> 00:32:51,683
there's gonna be wild animals
out here,

744
00:32:51,718 --> 00:32:53,518
but I don't know...

745
00:32:53,553 --> 00:32:55,354
I found something really odd.

746
00:32:55,388 --> 00:32:58,056
I woke up. I was up.
I went outside.

747
00:32:58,091 --> 00:32:59,625
Just kinda, you know,
looking around,

748
00:32:59,659 --> 00:33:01,960
and then I saw this frog.

749
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,264
I just went up to it,
and that's when I saw,

750
00:33:05,298 --> 00:33:07,733
you know, I'm like, okay,
that's not normal.

751
00:33:07,767 --> 00:33:09,768
Johnny. Johnny.

752
00:33:09,802 --> 00:33:12,304
Come here, man.
Check this out.

753
00:33:12,338 --> 00:33:14,373
Look at this.

754
00:33:14,407 --> 00:33:17,809
Daniel found a mutated frog.

755
00:33:17,844 --> 00:33:19,278
He had three back legs.

756
00:33:19,312 --> 00:33:23,115
One more leg, that means one
more person we can feed, right?

757
00:33:23,149 --> 00:33:27,052
Y-yeah, you know...
I don't know.

758
00:33:27,086 --> 00:33:29,187
Annie, Natalie, and I
set out to look for mushrooms.

759
00:33:29,222 --> 00:33:31,456
And we were spreading out,
looking around.

760
00:33:31,491 --> 00:33:32,958
It wasn't really going so hot.

761
00:33:32,992 --> 00:33:34,459
When was the last time
you said,

762
00:33:34,494 --> 00:33:35,994
"I'm gonna go pick some mushrooms?"

763
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:38,196
One of the only vegetables
I don't eat.

764
00:33:38,231 --> 00:33:39,698
I will today.

765
00:33:39,732 --> 00:33:41,166
Uh, it's actually
not a vegetable.

766
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,701
- Fun fact.
- Oh, right.

767
00:33:42,735 --> 00:33:44,202
Fungus. Whatever.

768
00:33:44,237 --> 00:33:46,138
And we started
walking out and looking.

769
00:33:46,172 --> 00:33:47,673
We couldn't find anything.

770
00:33:47,707 --> 00:33:50,976
And then Tommy just
kept going deeper and deeper,

771
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,544
and we were getting farther
and farther away

772
00:33:52,578 --> 00:33:54,379
from the settlement,
and, you know,

773
00:33:54,414 --> 00:33:55,914
we're still new here.

774
00:33:55,948 --> 00:33:57,149
I didn't want to stray too far.

775
00:33:57,183 --> 00:33:58,650
I was getting a little nervous.

776
00:33:58,685 --> 00:34:00,085
This is a good area!

777
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:01,553
I'm just gonna look
around here!

778
00:34:01,587 --> 00:34:03,255
I know, but we don't
want to go that far!

779
00:34:03,256 --> 00:34:05,016
We're far from the camp!

780
00:34:05,051 --> 00:34:06,892
Well, just stay
in earshot, okay?!

781
00:34:07,927 --> 00:34:09,394
Maybe--

782
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:11,063
We're not playing
Marco Polo with you!

783
00:34:11,097 --> 00:34:13,231
Maybe you should
come back this way!

784
00:34:13,266 --> 00:34:15,267
Polo!

785
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:23,842
What is that?

786
00:34:23,876 --> 00:34:27,045
We were just gonna go
get some water at the river,

787
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,482
and we discovered this shed
in the middle of a field.

788
00:34:30,516 --> 00:34:32,651
And, um, we tried to open
the door, but it was locked.

789
00:34:32,685 --> 00:34:35,187
You know what? I don't think we
should tell anyone about this.

790
00:34:35,221 --> 00:34:36,855
- No, I think we should tell everyone.
- No.

791
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:38,957
- Why not?
- Because we don't know what it is for.

792
00:34:38,991 --> 00:34:40,992
And we don't want everyone
to come here

793
00:34:41,027 --> 00:34:42,694
and start grabbing things.

794
00:34:42,729 --> 00:34:43,995
I don't trust them.

795
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,397
Let's just go pretend
like nothing happened.

796
00:34:45,431 --> 00:34:46,965
- Okay.
- Like, don't tell anybody.

797
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:50,669
Yes!

798
00:34:50,703 --> 00:34:52,904
Oh, my God!

799
00:34:52,939 --> 00:34:54,206
Oh, my God, this is awesome.

800
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,541
So Annie and I were the ones
who found the mushrooms,

801
00:34:56,576 --> 00:34:58,744
which was great, 'cause
everyone's so starving,

802
00:34:58,778 --> 00:35:00,879
and you could tell people were
starting to get cranky

803
00:35:00,913 --> 00:35:02,514
and starting to wear on people.

804
00:35:02,548 --> 00:35:04,149
I feel bad for Tommy, though,
because this was, like,

805
00:35:04,183 --> 00:35:06,218
- his little mission.
- I know.

806
00:35:06,252 --> 00:35:07,953
We just kind of stumbled
upon those mushrooms,

807
00:35:07,987 --> 00:35:11,189
and they were the same kind
as in the picture

808
00:35:11,224 --> 00:35:13,125
that, uh, that was
in the Revealer.

809
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:15,494
- We got mushrooms!
- Whoo!

810
00:35:15,528 --> 00:35:18,096
- Yes!
- Oh!

811
00:35:20,266 --> 00:35:22,267
We get to eat!
Yay!

812
00:35:24,337 --> 00:35:26,071
I mean, there wasn't that many,
so we are really

813
00:35:26,105 --> 00:35:27,806
gonna have to divide them up.

814
00:35:29,675 --> 00:35:31,977
Just a little bit of water
just to give them a quick rinse.

815
00:35:32,011 --> 00:35:33,278
So we needed to make sure

816
00:35:33,312 --> 00:35:34,713
that we cooked them
long enough, because

817
00:35:34,747 --> 00:35:37,015
I know I don't want
anybody getting sick.

818
00:35:37,049 --> 00:35:38,316
Does anyone know
how much water actually--

819
00:35:38,351 --> 00:35:39,818
We're gonna have
gourmet mushrooms.

820
00:35:39,852 --> 00:35:41,453
Maybe we should use our own
sweat as salt,

821
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:43,522
- as a...
- Oh...

822
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:49,009
_

823
00:35:49,495 --> 00:35:51,797
- We lost Tommy.
- Pick that up.

824
00:35:51,831 --> 00:35:55,834
He was going really far,
really deep into the woods.

825
00:35:55,868 --> 00:35:59,838
I know I personally didn't want
to stray that far from camp.

826
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,940
Thank you, Estrogen, for saying
a prayer for the rest of us.

827
00:36:01,974 --> 00:36:04,409
Did you call me "Estrogen"?

828
00:36:04,444 --> 00:36:06,678
Yeah, yeah-- has no one ever
called you "Estrogen" before?

829
00:36:06,712 --> 00:36:08,480
- No. - That seems like
the easiest nickname ever.

830
00:36:08,514 --> 00:36:10,382
- Be a gentleman. Be a gentleman.
- I quite like it.

831
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:13,552
There's-- there's a bit
of estrogen here.

832
00:36:15,254 --> 00:36:17,889
Anyone have a watch?

833
00:36:17,924 --> 00:36:19,391
What?!

834
00:36:19,425 --> 00:36:22,561
Who is--

835
00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:23,895
- Oh, my God!
- It's one of the cameramen.

836
00:36:25,465 --> 00:36:27,165
The head is bleeding.

837
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,201
- Oh, fuck!
- Oh, my God!

838
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,887
The cameraman was
bleeding from the head,

839
00:36:36,922 --> 00:36:38,289
and it was huge.

840
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:39,657
I mean, I couldn't get
that close,

841
00:36:39,691 --> 00:36:41,325
but from as far as I was,
I could see

842
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,960
that it was a big head wound.

843
00:36:42,994 --> 00:36:44,829
So it freaked us all out,
because nobody was telling us

844
00:36:44,863 --> 00:36:46,597
what was going on.

845
00:36:46,631 --> 00:36:49,100
Nobody would give us any answers
about what happened to him.

846
00:36:49,134 --> 00:36:50,634
Okay, everyone,

847
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:52,436
just go back to doing
what you were doing!

848
00:36:52,471 --> 00:36:54,171
- What?
- We don't know what happened to him?

849
00:36:54,206 --> 00:36:55,940
I have no idea.

850
00:36:57,476 --> 00:36:59,110
- He's okay...
- He doesn't look fine to me.

851
00:36:59,144 --> 00:37:00,778
Wh-what do you mean, he's fine?

852
00:37:00,812 --> 00:37:02,480
He's fine.
Just go back and, uh...

853
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:04,548
They're not gonna
tell us what happened.

854
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:06,884
He didn't look fine to me!

855
00:37:08,653 --> 00:37:10,354
What happened?

856
00:37:10,388 --> 00:37:12,022
- Where are they taking him?
- We don't know yet.

857
00:37:13,592 --> 00:37:15,559
How can-- how can we continue?

858
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,229
What's the difference
if you tell us inside?

859
00:37:18,263 --> 00:37:19,430
- You can tell us now.
- What was he saying?

860
00:37:19,464 --> 00:37:20,898
Does anyone understand
what he was saying?

861
00:37:20,932 --> 00:37:22,533
He was saying something.
I couldn't understand him.

862
00:37:22,567 --> 00:37:24,902
I guess he was speaking
Russian or something.

863
00:37:24,936 --> 00:37:26,237
I wish I knew what
that guy was saying.

864
00:37:26,271 --> 00:37:29,907
Something about "I saw them,"
"I saw... I saw them."

865
00:37:29,941 --> 00:37:31,876
"I saw them."

866
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,744
- How do <i>you</i> know that?
- Hmm?

867
00:37:33,779 --> 00:37:35,079
How do you know that?

868
00:37:35,113 --> 00:37:36,914
My grandmother.

869
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:43,420
- And the producers would be a little more
concerned. - Well, we'll just wait and see.

870
00:37:43,455 --> 00:37:45,756
- Let's just wait and--
- Looked like one of the younger ones, huh?

871
00:37:45,791 --> 00:37:47,224
He had the...

872
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,894
What the fuck is out there?

873
00:37:49,928 --> 00:37:53,197
We still don't know
what really happened.

874
00:37:53,231 --> 00:37:55,399
Hey. Tommy had a cameraman
with him, I think.

875
00:37:55,433 --> 00:37:57,935
- Are you sure? We saw him--I--
- Wait--

876
00:37:57,969 --> 00:37:59,703
- I haven't seen him since this morning.
- ...for mushrooms, but he--

877
00:37:59,738 --> 00:38:01,038
- I saw him.
- We were looking.

878
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:02,072
- Where?
- You saw him?

879
00:38:02,107 --> 00:38:03,207
Yeah.

880
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:04,341
- Oh, you've seen him?
- When?

881
00:38:04,376 --> 00:38:06,177
In the forest, back there.

882
00:38:06,211 --> 00:38:08,112
Sabina--
that's a mystery.

883
00:38:08,146 --> 00:38:09,580
I can't put my finger on it,

884
00:38:09,614 --> 00:38:12,249
but there's something
going on with her, like she--

885
00:38:12,284 --> 00:38:13,684
she knows something.

886
00:38:13,718 --> 00:38:15,586
I'm gonna turn back
and look for him.

887
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,954
He'll probably be by himself.

888
00:38:16,988 --> 00:38:18,556
Night's gonna be here soon,
so, yeah--

889
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,157
I'm not going out there.

890
00:38:20,192 --> 00:38:21,926
- Look at what happened to him.
- I'm staying with Esther.

891
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,427
- What happened to that guy.
- I'm going.

892
00:38:23,461 --> 00:38:25,029
I'm going.

893
00:38:25,063 --> 00:38:26,964
- Who wants to come, come with
me right now. - Stay together.

894
00:38:26,998 --> 00:38:29,200
- Natalie, you staying?
- No. I mean--

895
00:38:29,234 --> 00:38:31,035
- The people who saw him should come.
- Are you gonna stay with them?

896
00:38:31,069 --> 00:38:32,803
Maybe you should wait until
we find out

897
00:38:32,838 --> 00:38:34,638
- what happened to that-- that cameraman.
- Who do we have, guys?

898
00:38:34,673 --> 00:38:35,773
- We saw him--
- I'm staying.

899
00:38:35,807 --> 00:38:37,474
Sabina saw him,
so she should--

900
00:38:37,509 --> 00:38:38,742
Oh, there's the host!

901
00:38:41,012 --> 00:38:42,213
Everybody, I just need you

902
00:38:42,247 --> 00:38:44,515
to gather around the campfire.

903
00:38:48,753 --> 00:38:50,988
There's been...
a very serious...

904
00:38:51,022 --> 00:38:54,024
accident involving Tommy.

905
00:38:55,193 --> 00:38:58,095
Um, and unfortunately...

906
00:38:58,129 --> 00:38:59,630
it's fatal.

907
00:38:59,664 --> 00:39:01,765
- What?
- What?

908
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,567
- Oh, my God.
- Now...

909
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:06,837
we've been discussing whether
or not to go on with this.

910
00:39:06,872 --> 00:39:08,539
Um...

911
00:39:08,573 --> 00:39:10,140
but we've decided that

912
00:39:10,175 --> 00:39:12,743
that choice should be yours.

913
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,847
So I need you
to take some time now

914
00:39:16,882 --> 00:39:19,283
just to-- to think about it,

915
00:39:19,317 --> 00:39:22,419
and decide if you'd like
to continue.

916
00:39:22,454 --> 00:39:25,222
If you decide to opt out,

917
00:39:25,257 --> 00:39:28,292
we will be giving each of you
5,000 dollars...

918
00:39:28,326 --> 00:39:30,227
- Oh! My God...
- Just-- just head to the--

919
00:39:30,262 --> 00:39:32,296
- I can't believe we're talking
about money right now. - I--

920
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,198
this is just...

921
00:39:34,232 --> 00:39:35,833
Do you know how?

922
00:39:35,867 --> 00:39:40,204
We're still waiting
to find out.

923
00:39:40,238 --> 00:39:41,772
I'll be coming back
at the end of the day

924
00:39:41,806 --> 00:39:43,641
to get your answer, okay?

925
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,785
I've just realized now that...

926
00:39:54,819 --> 00:39:56,987
I don't think the show cares.

927
00:39:57,022 --> 00:39:58,656
I don't think that
production cares.

928
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,190
What I don't understand is,

929
00:40:00,225 --> 00:40:02,893
this is supposed to be a game.
How did somebody die?

930
00:40:02,928 --> 00:40:04,828
I mean, how do
the-- the producers of the show

931
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:07,564
let this happen?
How were they not prepared

932
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,800
to make sure that we're safe?

933
00:40:09,834 --> 00:40:11,802
I understand there's challenge.
There's a challenge out here,

934
00:40:11,836 --> 00:40:14,471
and it can be dangerous,
but nobody's supposed to die.

935
00:40:14,506 --> 00:40:15,906
It's a game.

936
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:18,342
It's just ridiculous.

937
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:21,278
And there wasn't
an explanation.

938
00:40:21,313 --> 00:40:24,048
I mean, there was, but it wasn't
a good one, not to me.

939
00:40:24,082 --> 00:40:27,952
I just... I...
I want to know more.

940
00:40:27,986 --> 00:40:29,620
I need more evidence.

941
00:40:29,654 --> 00:40:31,188
Something concrete.

942
00:40:36,962 --> 00:40:38,729
Just looking for this red...
...mushrooms,

943
00:40:38,763 --> 00:40:42,032
these--
not seeing any anywhere.

944
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:43,867
They should be red.

945
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:45,369
White dots on them.

946
00:40:46,938 --> 00:40:48,339
It's really not going too hot.

947
00:41:07,158 --> 00:41:09,593
Ahh! Help! Help!

948
00:41:10,962 --> 00:41:13,831
Aah! Aah! Ah-aah! Aah!

949
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:30,456
