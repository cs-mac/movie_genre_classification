Not now it's not, but I just watched
you transform it on the monitor.

"I think I'll just look like a
Maxi Babybel today." Was that it?

Well, I hear apparently
he is a she.

- No.
- No.

- A woman.
- Oh... a woman.

64

What kind of a woman
wants to run a company

65

I think I know.

67
00:05:19,908 --> 00:05:21,987
Big, hairy.

68
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,587
- Big sort of big lump.
- A beast.

69
00:05:26,748 --> 00:05:28,183
Might be perfect for you.

70
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:32,267
Hmm. Anyway, listen, this bike's
not going to park itself.

71
00:05:32,268 --> 00:05:34,506
I'll see you up there, OK?
Don't be late.

72
00:05:34,507 --> 00:05:37,461
I don't like my team to be late.
It's unprofessional, isn't it, bum flap?

- 'I'm doing "Scream".

79

the beast, Bruce.'

Who wouldn't swap the crystal
blue waters of the Pacific

82
00:06:23,904 --> 00:06:28,624
for the endless silted mud flats
of old Father Thames? Am I right?

83
00:06:30,384 --> 00:06:34,542
Uh, and hopefully I can prove to you
that I'm a better sales manager

84
00:06:34,543 --> 00:06:36,502
than I am a public speaker.

85
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,742
I bet she's got the bag
to go with them shoes.

86
00:06:39,743 --> 00:06:43,382
- Mm?
- Her, United States of Bitch Face.

Little Miss I'm-So-American.

88
00:06:47,663 --> 00:06:50,702
OK, I'm going to stop talking now.
Let's all have a drink.

89
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:53,055
Hear, hear.

90
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,861
- Oi.
- You were right, you know?

91
00:06:57,862 --> 00:06:59,821
She is a woman.

92
00:06:59,822 --> 00:07:02,654
And what a woman. Wow-wow-wee-wah.

93
00:07:03,462 --> 00:07:07,301
I would make a splash inside that
like a milk truck hitting a wall.

94
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:10,540
Listen, can we not... Can we not
talk ejaculate at the buffet table?

95
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:14,617
Look at her, though. Look at
my little dairy queen, uh?

96
00:07:15,781 --> 00:07:17,820
You see? You had
little a look, too.

97
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:20,379
- Oh, some tzatziki.
- Oh, that's cute.

98
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,340
No, it is. It's adorable, Bruce.
That's all right. You can look.

99
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:26,179
But don't touch 'cause that would
be embarrassing, wouldn't it?

100
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,419
- Just leave it to the experts.
- Sure.

101
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:32,019
- The sexperts. I just coined that.
- That's quite good, actually.

102
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,652
- Wasn't it?
- Don't!

103
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:41,738
Whoa!

104
00:07:41,739 --> 00:07:45,058
Work time is over, motherfuckers.

105
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:47,538
Ah, I think we know
what that means.

106
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:50,498
That means, oh, oh,
it's party time.

107
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:52,098
That's right.

108
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:54,377
Who wants to come and play
with the dancing bear?

109
00:07:54,378 --> 00:07:57,417
This one... This one loves
a little bear time.

110
00:07:57,418 --> 00:07:59,337
- Oh, God.
- Come on.

111
00:07:59,338 --> 00:08:02,017
- Not me.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

112
00:08:02,018 --> 00:08:03,816
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

113
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,217
Oh, there it is. You've got a little
bit of rhythm going on there.

114
00:08:07,218 --> 00:08:10,497
That's it, see?
What are you worried about?

115
00:08:10,498 --> 00:08:13,257
- She moves like a gem.
- Oh.

116
00:08:13,258 --> 00:08:14,976
- Oh, yeah.
- What are you like?

117
00:08:14,977 --> 00:08:18,416
And she loves a spin.
That was good, you see?

118
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:20,496
Oh, what about this one?

119
00:08:20,497 --> 00:08:22,936
Little silent but
deadly in the corner.

120
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:25,856
- Stop it.
- You going to come dancing with me?

121
00:08:25,857 --> 00:08:29,055
- Just a little something-something.
- Don't.

122
00:08:29,056 --> 00:08:31,408
- What?
- I don't dance.

123
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:35,412
- Everybody's dancing.
- I don't dance. I don't like it.

124
00:08:36,136 --> 00:08:38,254
All right, make yourself useful.

125
00:08:38,255 --> 00:08:40,367
Oh, Oh.

126
00:08:41,376 --> 00:08:43,334
Come on.

127
00:08:43,335 --> 00:08:46,691
Oh, the line broke,
'cause it was a big fish.

128
00:08:47,175 --> 00:08:50,291
What time is it? It's Cossack time!

129
00:08:52,535 --> 00:08:54,526
Oh, yes.

130
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:58,487
Hey, Bruce!

131
00:09:01,535 --> 00:09:04,334
Oh, you like it!

132
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,813
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

133
00:09:10,814 --> 00:09:13,092
- Wow, I am so sorry.
- Sorry, I'm sorry.

134
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:15,532
We've got tangled here.
Let me try and get this... Ow!

135
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:17,052
- Ow.
- Ow.

136
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:20,052
Again, I'm sorry.
Are you all right?

137
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:22,172
Where am I? Am I in England?

138
00:09:22,173 --> 00:09:24,645
No, I'm fine.
Just... fine.

139
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,412
Maybe we should get
these untangled.

140
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:31,125
- Bruce Garrett.
- Bruce Garrett, that's me and...

141
00:09:32,253 --> 00:09:35,291
- Julio Matthews.
- They printed it wrong.

142
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:37,451
But I like it, so I'm
going to keep it.

143
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,691
Yeah. No, you should.
I think it suits you.

144
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:41,730
Adds Latin flavour to it.

145
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:43,964
Oh.

146
00:09:44,931 --> 00:09:48,450
I just want you to know I wasn't
trying to escape your party.

147
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:52,887
No, me neither. Why would anybody
want to leave that amazing party?

148
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,729
- Uh, shall we...
- Yes.

149
00:09:56,451 --> 00:10:00,649
Well, what a pickle, a 3-D jigsaw.

150
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,329
Thank you. Nice to meet you, Bruce.

151
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,810
Likewise... Julio.

152
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,968
Mm.

153
00:10:09,969 --> 00:10:12,769
Mm. Do you know what I like
best about this place?

154
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,609
Apart from the free glacé cherries?

155
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,728
Apart from the free glacé cherries,

156
00:10:16,729 --> 00:10:18,488
the fact that they
still insist upon

157
00:10:18,489 --> 00:10:20,488
my little sister dressing up
like a Tongan concubine.

158
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:23,688
Oh, they don't insist and I
prefer Polynesian call girl.

159
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,208
Mm-hm.

160
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,048
So talk me through
head-butting your new boss.

161
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:29,727
Well, actually, she might
have head-butted me,

162
00:10:29,728 --> 00:10:33,368
but our lanyards tangled.
There was a struggle, you know?

163
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:35,608
Our heads went forward.
There was a crash, wallop.

164
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:37,807
Mm, sounds like she made
quite an impression.

165
00:10:37,808 --> 00:10:39,967
- No, no, not this again.
- Oh, come on, Bruce.

166
00:10:39,968 --> 00:10:42,527
You haven't even mentioned a girl
since, what, the early '90s?

167
00:10:42,528 --> 00:10:45,086
Stand down, Samantha, please.
She is not of my world.

168
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:47,647
Oh and what world is that,
the world of not even trying?

169
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:51,367
Yeah, indeed, the planet She's
Beautiful, Way Out Of My League,

170
00:10:51,368 --> 00:10:53,406
and also my boss, so
knock it on the head.

171
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:56,286
Oh, that well-known place. Is that
right next to precious comfort zone?

172
00:10:56,287 --> 00:10:59,046
A place you've never even
stepped out of ever.

173
00:10:59,047 --> 00:11:01,206
All I'm saying is that if
you really like something,

174
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:05,479
you've got to put yourself out there.
Got to reach out and grab it.

175
00:11:06,486 --> 00:11:08,086
The cherries are not
that delicious.

176
00:11:08,087 --> 00:11:09,851
I'm not talking about
the cherries, Bruce.

177
00:11:16,205 --> 00:11:18,045
I would not like to be those tyres.

178
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:21,925
- Ouch.
- Ha-ha, yeah, very amusing!

179
00:11:21,926 --> 00:11:25,724
It comes fitted with an 80-mil,
three jaw self-centring chuck.

180
00:11:25,725 --> 00:11:28,918
Tool size, eight mil max. I mean,
you'd never need any more.

181
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:33,404
- Hey, hello. This is, uh, Ju...
- Oh, sorry, everybody.

182
00:11:33,405 --> 00:11:35,963
Let me introduce you to the
brains of the operation,

183
00:11:35,964 --> 00:11:38,924
our head of department,
Miss Julia Matthews.

184
00:11:38,924 --> 00:11:42,244
Uh... I'm sorry. Keep going.
I was just going to sit in.

185
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:44,356
It's nice to have you with us.

186
00:11:45,124 --> 00:11:47,243
- Are you done?
- Yeah.

187
00:11:47,244 --> 00:11:49,523
- Any questions?
- What's the capacity?

188
00:11:49,524 --> 00:11:51,243
- Ah, capacity.
- Ah.

189
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:54,122
- It's 250 mil between the centres.
- You really know your stuff.

190
00:11:54,123 --> 00:11:57,600
Thank you. Thank you.
I... I love lathes.

191
00:12:03,283 --> 00:12:09,201
Oh, while I remember, we can
also provide, um, promo videos.

192
00:12:09,202 --> 00:12:10,801
- Isn't that right, Bruce?
- Mm.

193
00:12:10,802 --> 00:12:14,801
Actually, I think we've got one of
those on this computer right here.

194
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:17,121
Not on that one.
Let me have a look.

195
00:12:17,122 --> 00:12:21,321
Yeah, I think I saw the one for
the DML vertical lathe on here

196
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:22,921
- somewhere the other day.
- No.

197
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:25,161
- Wait, there it is. Hold on.
- Is it?

198
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:28,240
Yeah, this is a really good example
of the videos we can give you.

199
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:32,320
'Hello, with a Meehanite frame
annealed for maximum rigidity,

200
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:36,360
'it offers perfect jib-bed
flushing each and every time.

201
00:12:36,361 --> 00:12:38,639
'The Haas ST30 turning lathe,

202
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,440
'it offers precision grinding
over full vertical stroke.'

203
00:12:42,441 --> 00:12:46,877
This is what I think of when I'm
trying not to ejaculate too quickly.

204
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,912
OK, green fees paid, let's
play the game of golf game.

205
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:04,598
Please help me.

206
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:06,398
Are you still banging
on about those balls?

207
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,117
Well, yes, this one's
going to fly further,

208
00:13:08,118 --> 00:13:10,317
but this one's going to give me
more control round the green.

209
00:13:10,318 --> 00:13:11,878
If we've finished with
the high-brow chit-chat,

210
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,597
can we move on please
to the weekly roundup?

211
00:13:13,598 --> 00:13:15,277
- Yes, yes.
- OK, ladies and gentlemen.

212
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:17,717
Totals for the week,
dates with a lady?

213
00:13:17,718 --> 00:13:19,157
- Nil.
- Nil.

214
00:13:19,158 --> 00:13:21,477
- Mobile numbers acquired?
- Nil.

215
00:13:21,478 --> 00:13:23,837
I got a number. It was a zero.

216
00:13:23,838 --> 00:13:25,997
Ah, erotic encounters?

217
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:27,517
Nilly vanilly.

218
00:13:27,518 --> 00:13:31,076
Now, listen to this.
Last Sunday at Tom's christening,

219
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:33,716
I grazed past horny
Aunty Jean's side boob?

220
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:35,317
- Does it count?
- Adjudicator?

221
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:38,116
- It's a nil.
- I thought I'd throw it in.

222
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,636
Finally, have you had any contact
with a member of the opposite sex

223
00:13:40,636 --> 00:13:42,155
where money did not exchange hands

224
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:43,915
and she looked at you for
more than eight seconds

225
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,915
and she was not your mum
or an arresting officer?

226
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,755
Nil.

227
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,795
Bruce?

228
00:13:51,796 --> 00:13:53,755
Mm? Well, no, obvs...

229
00:13:53,756 --> 00:13:56,152
Here endeth the weekly roundup.

230
00:13:58,276 --> 00:14:00,195
Hurry up, Mickey!

231
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:08,988
Ah, thank you... very much.

232
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,394
- Oh.
- What is it?

233
00:14:11,395 --> 00:14:13,634
- Shit. Nothing. Please don't look.
- What's wrong?

234
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:15,234
What are you doing? What is it?

235
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:17,673
- Please don't look.
- Who is it, hm?

236
00:14:17,674 --> 00:14:20,473
It's just someone from work.
It's a girl I work with.

237
00:14:20,474 --> 00:14:23,233
- Oh, my God, she's nice.
- Don't look. Stop it.

238
00:14:23,234 --> 00:14:25,633
- Hey, turn around, will you?
- Oh, I would...

239
00:14:25,634 --> 00:14:28,553
- If I was physically able...
- You're not dis...

240
00:14:28,554 --> 00:14:30,710
You're not disabled,
Gary. You're married.

241
00:14:32,154 --> 00:14:34,549
Go on, then. Have a go.

242
00:14:35,273 --> 00:14:37,913
Did you see her? She's beautiful.
She's like a ten. I'm a two.

243
00:14:37,914 --> 00:14:41,832
That's an eight-point swing, like a
butterfly going out with a parsnip.

244
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,792
- What?
- Yeah. Well, you know...

245
00:14:43,793 --> 00:14:46,991
All right, I'm not saying
it's going to be easy.

246
00:14:46,992 --> 00:14:49,631
You'll have to work at it.
It's like that, um,

247
00:14:49,632 --> 00:14:51,511
that machine you're on about
for British Aerospace.

248
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:53,911
- The PL5 cylindrical grinder.
- Thank you.

249
00:14:53,912 --> 00:14:56,831
She's the cylinder. Click-click.

250
00:14:56,832 --> 00:14:59,511
You're the grinder, mm?

251
00:14:59,512 --> 00:15:03,391
Just grind her down, uh, uh, uh.

252
00:15:03,392 --> 00:15:07,231
- You grind her down.
- I don't like the two-finger bit.

253
00:15:07,231 --> 00:15:09,988
Make her notice you, Bruce.

254
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:16,710
- Think I should say hello?
- Oh, don't... no.

255
00:15:16,711 --> 00:15:19,031
Go up there and say
something like...

256
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:22,429
"Hi."

257
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,509
Oh.

258
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,429
Woo-hoo. Good luck, mate.

259
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,269
- Bruce.
- Yes?

260
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,149
Grind it.

261
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,829
Don't do that. Don't be daft.

262
00:16:08,587 --> 00:16:10,459
'Salsa.'

263
00:16:11,227 --> 00:16:13,106
Why did it have to be salsa?

264
00:16:13,107 --> 00:16:17,106
'Eat them. Eat them pig boy.
Eat your sequins.

265
00:16:17,107 --> 00:16:19,666
'Eat them. Eat them!

266
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:22,423
'Who do you think you are?
Barry Manilow?

267
00:16:24,427 --> 00:16:26,702
'Eat them...'

268
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,505
Hey, Rick, have you seen my sister?

269
00:16:36,506 --> 00:16:39,505
- She's over there.
- Sam, Sam. Sam, sorry.

270
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:41,661
- Give us a second.
- I need you.

271
00:16:45,425 --> 00:16:47,384
She is of my world.

272
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:49,424
- Who is?
- Julia, my boss.

273
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,864
You stepped out of
your comfort zone.

274
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:55,744
I was at the pub. She came in.
I followed her.

275
00:16:55,745 --> 00:16:58,304
And she was salsa dancing.

276
00:16:58,305 --> 00:17:00,303
- Are you shitting me?
- Oh, my God.

277
00:17:00,304 --> 00:17:02,623
She was doing the
sweetest little basic

278
00:17:02,624 --> 00:17:05,583
and I just wanted to rush in
and gather her into my arms

279
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:08,703
and... and... just dance, you know?

280
00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:12,823
I haven't... I have not
felt like that since...

281
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,463
- Sequin-gate.
- Since Sequin-gate.

282
00:17:15,464 --> 00:17:19,822
You know that box has been
closed a long, long time.

283
00:17:19,823 --> 00:17:22,742
I know. It happened and it was bad.

284
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:25,542
What did you say? Bad?

285
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:29,661
Sam... they ripped all the
sequins off of my shirt

286
00:17:29,662 --> 00:17:32,701
and they stuffed them
in my mouth, yeah?

287
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:36,062
And then they made me eat them.
The big boys made me gobble them, yeah?

288
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:39,021
Just gobbling, gobbling sequins.

289
00:17:39,022 --> 00:17:41,781
- Gobbling the big BMX boy.
- Know the story, Bruce.

290
00:17:41,782 --> 00:17:44,541
- Gobbling.
- Enough's enough. Now, listen.

291
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:47,141
Maybe this is your chance
to rewrite history.

292
00:17:47,142 --> 00:17:48,621
Let it go.

293
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,460
What are you thinking about?

294
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:56,173
These are fucking hot
in large quantities.

295
00:17:56,861 --> 00:17:58,853
Thank you.

296
00:18:01,101 --> 00:18:03,259
Fucking hell, what is...
What is that?

297
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,780
- Vodka.
- Why would you give me neat vodka?

298
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,939
Now, listen, maybe
this is your way in.

299
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,579
You know how all girls
love a man who can dance.

300
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,659
You could dance.

301
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:21,252
If you really like this girl,
salsa your way in.

302
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:26,739
- I had fire in my heels, didn't I?
- Oh, feet of flames.

303
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:31,494
- Could I get it back again, though?
- Easily.

304
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:34,658
How easily?

305
00:18:36,058 --> 00:18:38,094
See how I do this shot...

306
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,457
- That easily.
- That was easy.

307
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,457
- Mm.
- Can I have one?

308
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,614
- One?
- Mm-hm.

309
00:18:47,618 --> 00:18:49,496
Salsa.

310
00:18:49,497 --> 00:18:51,053
Mm.

311
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,377
Cheers.

312
00:19:03,257 --> 00:19:04,649
Ah.

313
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,295
Salsa.

314
00:19:13,295 --> 00:19:15,407
Salsa.

315
00:19:19,136 --> 00:19:21,095
And the winner is...

316
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:23,887
Bruce Garrett.

317
00:19:36,135 --> 00:19:38,253
There's Ron.

318
00:19:38,254 --> 00:19:39,854
"Be my Valentine."

319
00:19:39,854 --> 00:19:43,047
Mm, big old ginger Glen and Ted.

320
00:19:47,094 --> 00:19:50,690
Mirrors, I need me some mirrors.

321
00:19:56,734 --> 00:19:58,172
Ooh.

322
00:19:58,173 --> 00:19:59,892
Heavy.

323
00:19:59,893 --> 00:20:01,569
Oh.

324
00:20:13,732 --> 00:20:15,211
Whoa.

325
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,771
Ooh!

326
00:20:22,772 --> 00:20:24,851
Ah.

327
00:20:27,892 --> 00:20:30,003
Uh...

328
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:18,404
Mm.

329
00:22:11,485 --> 00:22:14,644
Can I have a Diet Coke and a
packet of Scampi Fries, please?

330
00:22:14,645 --> 00:22:17,444
Well, you could if
I wasn't closing.

331
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:20,120
All right, Ron?

332
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:26,163
Garrett.

333
00:22:26,164 --> 00:22:28,803
Well, what the hell happened to you?
You look like shit.

334
00:22:28,804 --> 00:22:30,403
Charming. Thanks very much.

335
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:33,723
You got a customer complaints
department here at, er, El Corazón?

336
00:22:33,724 --> 00:22:35,835
Oh, hang on, I'll
get a form for you.

337
00:22:38,363 --> 00:22:40,442
There it is.

338
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,802
How did you find me?

339
00:22:42,803 --> 00:22:44,322
Internet.

340
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:46,315
- Fucking internet.
- Internet.

341
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:50,876
Oh, yeah, how have you been?
Have you been all right? You good?

342
00:22:52,082 --> 00:22:54,718
It looks nice in here.

343
00:22:55,162 --> 00:22:57,994
OK, I think that is us
all caught up, then.

344
00:22:59,482 --> 00:23:04,561
- What do you want from me, Garrett?
- Nothing. Just passing.

345
00:23:04,561 --> 00:23:06,837
Wondered if you were
still teaching.

346
00:23:08,202 --> 00:23:14,080
Oh, right, OK, just 'cause
I'm looking for a lesson.

347
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:15,880
- Are you taking the piss?
- No.

348
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:19,599
No, I'm not. I just want a
lesson, blow away the cobwebs.

349
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,320
- What do you reckon?
- I reckon salsa's for pussies.

350
00:23:22,321 --> 00:23:24,159
- Isn't that what you said?
- Did I?

351
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,839
Oh, yeah, you did.

352
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,399
I don't really remember that,
'cause I was just a kid.

353
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,559
- And what are you now?
- I'm a man.

354
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,479
Oh, you think so, do you?

355
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,632
Pretty certain.
Hot in here, isn't it?

356
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:44,638
We'll see. Tomorrow
night, 7:00 pm sharp.

357
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:47,518
Five quid on the door and I want
to see you in 1% inch heels.

358
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:50,472
Brilliant. Great, all right.
Thank you, Ron.

359
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:53,995
- Mr Parfitt.
- Thank you, Mr Parfitt.

360
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:55,797
Hey, where are we on
the Scampi Fries?

361
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:57,834
- Piss off.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

362
00:24:03,838 --> 00:24:05,837
Come here, my babies.

363
00:24:05,837 --> 00:24:08,397
Come to Daddy.

364
00:24:08,398 --> 00:24:10,598
Oh, there you are.

365
00:24:26,236 --> 00:24:28,315
- Thank you.
- One, thank you.

366
00:24:41,556 --> 00:24:45,948
Rubber sole. Old school.

367
00:24:46,955 --> 00:24:49,554
A shit load of kudos
to you, my friend.

368
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:52,747
Personally, as a person,
I love the suede sole.

369
00:24:53,355 --> 00:24:56,553
I'm a suede head. People, they say,
"No, you have to be rubber sole."

370
00:24:56,554 --> 00:24:59,753
I'm like, "No, I love the suede.
I love the suede. I love the suede."

371
00:24:59,754 --> 00:25:03,353
Don't you love the suede?
I tell you what. Take a look at this.

372
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:05,393
If you see here, if you
see where my sole is...

373
00:25:05,394 --> 00:25:07,593
Come on, gather around. Come on.

374
00:25:07,594 --> 00:25:09,913
I see what kind of a
sole you are, asshole.

375
00:25:09,914 --> 00:25:12,192
- Hey, don't...
- How are you today, guys?

376
00:25:12,193 --> 00:25:14,633
Spread out a little bit.
Make sure you can see me.

377
00:25:14,634 --> 00:25:16,512
Everybody OK, yeah?

378
00:25:16,513 --> 00:25:18,432
Oh, we've got a new
student with us tonight.

379
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,305
Welcome to El Corazón.
What's your name?

380
00:25:21,073 --> 00:25:24,632
It's fine. Don't worry about names.
I'm just passing through so...

381
00:25:24,633 --> 00:25:26,432
- Sure, no problem.
- Thank you.

382
00:25:26,433 --> 00:25:28,391
Let's pick up where we
left off yesterday, OK?

383
00:25:28,392 --> 00:25:29,832
Basic step, everyone. Ready?

384
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:33,152
And one, two, three,
five, six, seven and...

385
00:25:33,153 --> 00:25:35,311
- Sorry
- Yes?

386
00:25:35,312 --> 00:25:37,311
I think I'm in the wrong class.

387
00:25:37,312 --> 00:25:39,470
- Right.
- Where's Mr Parfitt?

388
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,271
- He's in his office, OK?
- OK.

389
00:25:42,272 --> 00:25:44,430
All right, let's carry on.
Ready and...

390
00:25:44,431 --> 00:25:47,750
What's he, um... Sorry.
What's he doing in there?

391
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:50,390
- I don't know.
- Fine, all right.

392
00:25:50,391 --> 00:25:51,910
- I'm sorry. Crack on.
- That's all right.

393
00:25:51,911 --> 00:25:53,430
- We will, thank you.
- Do your basics.

394
00:25:53,431 --> 00:25:55,390
Thank you very much. Here we go.

395
00:25:55,391 --> 00:25:57,470
Ready and one, two, three.

396
00:26:00,031 --> 00:26:01,903
Hello?

397
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:09,429
- Hey. Are you not teaching me?
- I said I ran a class.

398
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,869
- Didn't say I taught one.
- Ron, please.

399
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:16,586
It's baby stuff out there.
Just one quick freshener.

400
00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:21,308
Oh, I see.

401
00:26:21,309 --> 00:26:22,748
OK.

402
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,789
I think we've done...
One private lesson.

403
00:26:28,869 --> 00:26:32,541
How much do you want?
40 for an hour?

404
00:26:32,828 --> 00:26:34,467
Oh, that's what you think.

405
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:35,827
You think I sit back here

406
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:37,827
waiting for someone to come
in and open their wallet?

407
00:26:37,828 --> 00:26:39,744
Yeah, what are you waiting for?

408
00:26:43,507 --> 00:26:45,499
Alicia.

409
00:26:47,068 --> 00:26:50,986
- Hello.
- This is Bruce Garrett.

410
00:26:50,987 --> 00:26:52,827
- Take him out for a quick spin.
- No.

411
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:54,026
Road test him.

412
00:26:54,027 --> 00:26:56,066
Alicia teaches our advanced class,

413
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:59,746
2007 world champion,
dances cabaret style.

414
00:26:59,747 --> 00:27:01,466
Oh, yes, yes.

415
00:27:01,467 --> 00:27:04,507
You do know cabaret style, yeah?

416
00:27:04,906 --> 00:27:09,266
Sorry, do I... You ask
if I know cabaret style?

417
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:22,265
Do you want to get warm?

418
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,745
You should, although you
look quite warm as it is.

419
00:27:30,865 --> 00:27:32,976
I hear about you.

420
00:27:34,664 --> 00:27:38,103
- Ah.
- The boy with fire in his heels.

421
00:27:38,104 --> 00:27:40,063
Well, that's a long time ago.

422
00:27:40,464 --> 00:27:41,784
Aw.

423
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,940
- You're in my yard now.
- Mm?

424
00:27:46,104 --> 00:27:47,903
Oh, crikey.

425
00:27:47,904 --> 00:27:49,340
Shh-ah.

426
00:27:51,263 --> 00:27:53,375
Ah, cha.

427
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:57,222
- Ya.
- Rumba!

428
00:28:12,462 --> 00:28:13,741
Ow!

429
00:28:13,742 --> 00:28:15,538
Ow!

430
00:28:18,502 --> 00:28:20,778
Ow!

431
00:28:34,581 --> 00:28:36,541
Please.

432
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,456
Stop it.

433
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,819
Ooh.

434
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,859
Welcome back.

435
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,172
That's lesson one, son.

436
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:10,255
Thank you.

437
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:22,617
All right, dump truck.

438
00:29:22,618 --> 00:29:24,257
Have you seen what
she's wearing today?

439
00:29:24,258 --> 00:29:27,217
- Who?
- The big boss, yeah.

440
00:29:27,218 --> 00:29:29,697
She's got her green number on.
Isn't that nice?

441
00:29:29,698 --> 00:29:31,936
She's trying to tell me something,
you know what I mean?

442
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:35,016
She's trying to tell me something.

443
00:29:35,017 --> 00:29:37,776
I'm going to leave a stink on her
that she will never get off.

444
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:40,736
I'm going to be on her like
bonfire smell, you know I mean?

445
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,975
She's going to be in the
shower changing her clothes.

446
00:29:43,976 --> 00:29:48,496
She's going to be like,
"OMG, I can still smell him."

447
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:51,613
That's right, Julia. Get used to it.
I'm in your pores.

448
00:29:52,496 --> 00:29:55,295
You're disgusting.

449
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,415
I think it's so cute when
you've got a little crush.

450
00:30:00,416 --> 00:30:03,815
You get a little crush and you
get so disgusted. Listen.

451
00:30:03,816 --> 00:30:08,688
Women like that use guys like you
to get advice about men like me.

452
00:30:10,895 --> 00:30:12,931
It's empty.

453
00:30:36,494 --> 00:30:38,692
Are you kidding me?

454
00:30:38,693 --> 00:30:40,333
Argh!

455
00:30:40,334 --> 00:30:42,332
Ah! Oh...

456
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:43,892
Oh, God.

457
00:30:43,893 --> 00:30:46,492
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

458
00:30:46,493 --> 00:30:48,772
- Oh, my God, are you OK?
- Yeah.

459
00:30:48,773 --> 00:30:52,092
- Somebody call an ambulance!
- Really, no, I'm fine.

460
00:30:52,093 --> 00:30:54,969
Don't move. Don't move. Don't move.
Don't move. Don't move.

461
00:30:57,572 --> 00:31:00,370
In for two, out for two. Slow down.

462
00:31:00,371 --> 00:31:03,607
- Was there a pastry in this bag?
- Yeah, I had an iced bun.

463
00:31:05,092 --> 00:31:06,410
I was driving...

464
00:31:06,411 --> 00:31:09,210
and then, all of a sudden, my tape
deck wasn't working and then bang!

465
00:31:09,211 --> 00:31:11,451
All of a sudden you were on the hood
of my car. I thought I'd killed you.

466
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,370
Listen, don't worry. I'm fine.

467
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,410
OK. OK, you're OK.

468
00:31:15,411 --> 00:31:17,170
- Yeah. We're OK.
- I'm OK.

469
00:31:17,171 --> 00:31:19,050
You're alive!

470
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:21,209
I mean, I hit you with my car,

471
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,650
the least I could do is
give you a ride home.

472
00:31:23,651 --> 00:31:27,490
Don't worry about it.
It's only a little car, isn't it?

473
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,209
Oh, my God.
Are you going to sue me?

474
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:32,809
No! No, gosh, no. Good
Lord, I'd never sue.

475
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:34,849
You know we're not... As a society,

476
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,209
we're not really big
suers, you know?

477
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,648
We don't... We don't do it.

478
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:41,769
God, you're rambling. Are you OK?

479
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,409
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

480
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,288
- No, I'm fine.
- OK, what's my name?

481
00:31:45,289 --> 00:31:47,445
- Do you remember my name?
- Julio.

482
00:31:52,928 --> 00:31:56,288
Oh, there's the culprit.

483
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,007
- Oh.
- The cassette of death.

484
00:31:58,008 --> 00:32:00,887
<i>La casete de muerte.</i>

485
00:32:00,888 --> 00:32:04,686
Ah, Tito Puente, Willie
Colón, Ray Barretto.

486
00:32:04,687 --> 00:32:09,127
Oh, yes, let's just put that
somewhere else far, far away.

487
00:32:09,128 --> 00:32:11,087
It's uh...

488
00:32:11,648 --> 00:32:15,646
I salsa, OK? I'm into salsa.

489
00:32:15,647 --> 00:32:18,126
In fact, I was on my
way to salsa class,

490
00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:21,685
which is why I was willing
to kill a man to get there,

491
00:32:21,686 --> 00:32:24,126
so that's how much I like salsa.

492
00:32:30,606 --> 00:32:32,485
All right, so you've
entered total shock.

493
00:32:32,486 --> 00:32:35,166
Are you in a state of shock now?

494
00:32:36,126 --> 00:32:37,998
I... I salsa.

495
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,805
Ah.

496
00:32:48,245 --> 00:32:50,124
Right, sure you do.

497
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:52,281
Wow, now I'm really worried
about you. Are you OK?

498
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,444
Did Helen tell you about
the, uh, bowling?

499
00:32:56,445 --> 00:32:59,084
'Cause we're going to do this
whole bowling-bonding thing

500
00:32:59,085 --> 00:33:01,083
if you want to come.

501
00:33:01,084 --> 00:33:04,883
Uh, yeah. Yeah,
definitely. Definitely.

502
00:33:04,884 --> 00:33:08,283
I like bowling. I was...
I was born to bowl, really.

503
00:33:08,284 --> 00:33:12,317
Born to bowl, wow.
That's a big statement.

504
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:31,121
One more time and...

505
00:33:31,122 --> 00:33:33,721
One, two, three, five, six, seven.

506
00:33:33,722 --> 00:33:36,521
Let's try that one more time.
Ready and one...

507
00:33:36,522 --> 00:33:40,041
Oh, you, whatever your name is.

508
00:33:40,042 --> 00:33:45,161
My name is Bruce Garrett and
I'm here to learn salsa.

509
00:33:45,162 --> 00:33:48,640
Well, very nice to meet you, Bruce.
We're walking through some basics.

510
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:53,520
Ready and one, two, three,
to the side, six, seven.

511
00:33:53,521 --> 00:33:56,878
Forward and turn. Back and shimmy.

512
00:33:57,321 --> 00:34:01,600
One more time and...
one, two, three, five, six, seven.

513
00:34:01,601 --> 00:34:04,640
Forward and turn, back and shimmy.

514
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:06,879
Nice one, Bruce.

515
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,519
Let's try that again. Ready
and five, six, seven, go!

516
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,232
Turn! Shimmy!

517
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,915
One more time.

518
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,518
Yeah, thank you.

519
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:27,958
<i>Well done, everyone. Muy bien.</i>

520
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:30,758
See you next week. Thank you
very much, guys. Thank you.

521
00:34:30,758 --> 00:34:32,758
Woo.

522
00:34:32,759 --> 00:34:34,959
Ah.

523
00:34:36,518 --> 00:34:38,630
- I love this.
- Hey.

524
00:34:39,398 --> 00:34:41,557
I just wanted to say sorry
for being rude to you.

525
00:34:41,558 --> 00:34:44,677
Yes, you were.
You were very rude to me.

526
00:34:44,678 --> 00:34:47,390
You were kind of a pig to
me, actually, a rude pig.

527
00:34:49,038 --> 00:34:52,956
I'm kidding with you. God!
My name is Bejan, nice to meet you.

528
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:55,117
- I'm Bruce.
- Bruce, hi.

529
00:34:55,118 --> 00:34:57,156
Bejan is actually my middle name.

530
00:34:57,157 --> 00:34:59,276
My full name is Ali
Reza Bejan Ahmadzadeh.

531
00:34:59,277 --> 00:35:01,315
Wow, a bit of a mouthful, innit?

532
00:35:01,316 --> 00:35:03,996
Yes. Bejan means hero.

533
00:35:03,997 --> 00:35:06,076
- Ah, that's nice.
- What does Bruce mean?

534
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:12,235
Uh, Bruce, I think it comes from the
old Saxon meaning bush or hedge.

535
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:14,228
Mm.

536
00:35:14,876 --> 00:35:16,515
We're all hitting the
club if you want to...

537
00:35:16,516 --> 00:35:19,752
- Oh, right.
- Boteco. It's hot shit.

538
00:35:20,275 --> 00:35:25,435
The dance floor, fully programmable
LED ester and black glass.

539
00:35:25,436 --> 00:35:27,634
- Wow. Semi-sprung?
- Yes, please.

540
00:35:27,635 --> 00:35:31,187
Mm, it would be like
dancing on a glass pillow.

541
00:35:32,155 --> 00:35:35,034
- You want to come? Take my number.
- I don't know.

542
00:35:35,035 --> 00:35:36,713
- You don't want to take my number?
- Not your number.

543
00:35:36,714 --> 00:35:38,434
You don't have to take my
number if you don't want it.

544
00:35:38,435 --> 00:35:40,713
I can walk in the other direction.
Plenty of other people to speak to.

545
00:35:40,714 --> 00:35:42,233
I'm sure one of them
want my number.

546
00:35:42,234 --> 00:35:44,313
- I didn't mean that.
- I'm fucking with you again!

547
00:35:44,314 --> 00:35:47,550
Get a sense of humour,
for God's sake! Wait there.

548
00:35:49,993 --> 00:35:52,513
I'm going to give you
my direct number, OK?

549
00:35:52,514 --> 00:35:58,392
You call me on this any time
between 5:30 and quarter to six.

550
00:35:58,393 --> 00:36:01,105
That's a.m. I'm a morning person.

551
00:36:02,113 --> 00:36:04,149
Thank you.

552
00:36:05,273 --> 00:36:08,272
- I tracked down Ron Parfitt.
- Oh, my God. What's he like?

553
00:36:08,272 --> 00:36:11,431
Exactly the same. Just a
horrible, grumpy, old bastard.

554
00:36:11,432 --> 00:36:14,112
Holy shit, Bruce. This is huge.

555
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:17,991
Is this for her?

556
00:36:17,992 --> 00:36:21,270
"Is this for her?"
Yes, it's for her.

557
00:36:21,271 --> 00:36:24,584
I'm thinking about asking
her to maybe dance with me.

558
00:36:24,952 --> 00:36:26,951
That sounds good, so
what happens next?

559
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:28,990
- I'm just going go ask her.
- Wrong.

560
00:36:28,991 --> 00:36:31,350
No, no, no. You don't go straight
in with a big romantic gesture

561
00:36:31,351 --> 00:36:32,950
until you've done the groundwork.

562
00:36:32,951 --> 00:36:35,270
She's like a blank wall, Bruce.

563
00:36:35,271 --> 00:36:36,710
Firstly, you have to
apply the primer,

564
00:36:36,711 --> 00:36:38,430
then the undercoat and then
you go in with the emulsion.

565
00:36:38,431 --> 00:36:41,350
What kind of wall?
It might not need primer.

566
00:36:41,351 --> 00:36:42,750
I'm serious, Bruce.

567
00:36:42,751 --> 00:36:45,703
You can't go and ask her out
until you've done the undercoat.

568
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:40,946
Fantastic, that's just tremendous.
Hey, Bruce.

569
00:37:40,946 --> 00:37:43,586
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, man.

570
00:37:43,587 --> 00:37:45,505
You look nice, but you know what?

571
00:37:45,506 --> 00:37:48,625
I'm already, er, sorted
with a phone plan.

572
00:37:50,507 --> 00:37:53,547
Bruce, you need your shoes otherwise
you're gonna miss out on this frame.

573
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,385
- Good luck.
- All right, here we go.

574
00:37:56,386 --> 00:37:57,898
Phone shop.

575
00:37:59,106 --> 00:38:00,785
- Oh.
- Oh.

576
00:38:00,786 --> 00:38:03,138
Here comes the dirty thunder.

577
00:38:04,945 --> 00:38:07,344
Oh, the Gaelic gale.

578
00:38:07,345 --> 00:38:10,745
- Huh? I hit seven, I think.
- Move over.

579
00:38:13,185 --> 00:38:15,064
Oh.

580
00:38:15,065 --> 00:38:16,544
- Never mind.
- Pump it up.

581
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:19,063
Amazing. Ah.

582
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:22,423
Can I just give you a little bit
of constructive feedback?

583
00:38:22,424 --> 00:38:25,343
- Yeah, please do.
- Oh, yeah.

584
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:28,943
Well, uh, I've noticed a
little flaw in your game.

585
00:38:28,943 --> 00:38:30,783
OK, listen, I think I know
what you're going to say.

586
00:38:30,784 --> 00:38:32,782
This probably is about me

587
00:38:32,783 --> 00:38:36,542
continually rolling the balls into
the recess gutters, isn't it?

588
00:38:36,543 --> 00:38:39,382
- Yes, it is.
- Yeah. I think...

589
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,742
I think it's the only weakness
in my game, you know?

590
00:38:41,743 --> 00:38:45,381
It is. It is the only weakness,
but, uh, it's a pretty major one.

591
00:38:45,382 --> 00:38:47,662
- Yeah, it's a biggy.
- So let's deal with it.

592
00:38:47,663 --> 00:38:50,302
Here, I'll show you. Come on.

593
00:38:50,303 --> 00:38:53,256
Oh! Sumba, bunga, wunga!

594
00:38:53,743 --> 00:38:55,539
Did you see that?

595
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,501
So you put your
fingers in the holes.

596
00:38:59,262 --> 00:39:02,181
No. No, no, no, no.
No innuendo, OK?

597
00:39:02,182 --> 00:39:05,261
The first rule of bowling is
there's holes and there's balls

598
00:39:05,262 --> 00:39:07,181
and we're all adults.
We just have to get over it.

599
00:39:07,182 --> 00:39:09,580
- Let's bowl.
- Yup.

600
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:11,340
Hold your ball like a baby.

601
00:39:11,341 --> 00:39:13,460
- Throw it like a rocket.
- Yup.

602
00:39:13,461 --> 00:39:16,580
Hold it like a baby.
Throw it like a rocket, yeah?

603
00:39:16,581 --> 00:39:18,573
Yeah.

604
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:22,940
Hold it like a baby and then
I throw it like a rocket.

605
00:39:22,941 --> 00:39:26,380
I hold it like a baby and then
I throw it like a rocket.

606
00:39:26,381 --> 00:39:29,377
Hold it like a baby and then
I throw it like a rocket.

607
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,378
Sorry. Sorry.

608
00:39:33,379 --> 00:39:35,099
I'm calling social services.

609
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,019
You're calling social services?

610
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,612
Why? Has he been within
100 metres of a school?

611
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:46,258
- You're up, Jules.
- Oh.

612
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:48,498
Go on, Julio, if that's your name.

613
00:39:48,499 --> 00:39:51,538
Listen, you just focus on
your baby rocket big shot.

614
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:53,297
Yeah.

615
00:39:53,298 --> 00:39:56,457
All right. Let's do this.

616
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:58,298
Come on, baby ball.

617
00:39:58,298 --> 00:40:01,417
- I just need one strike.
- Oh, wow.

618
00:40:01,418 --> 00:40:03,977
Have you seen the pants
on that guy over there?

619
00:40:06,857 --> 00:40:08,609
- Go on.
- Here we go.

620
00:40:10,538 --> 00:40:12,776
Did you end up keeping the shoes
or you gave them back or...?

621
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:16,576
- No, I gave them back.
- I thought they really suited you.

622
00:40:16,577 --> 00:40:18,496
Ah, do you mind if I
just put my seat back?

623
00:40:18,497 --> 00:40:21,096
- Oh, there's not much room here.
- It's just I've got such long legs.

624
00:40:21,097 --> 00:40:23,013
Oh! That's better.

625
00:40:23,497 --> 00:40:28,129
Bruce, we'll drop you off first.
All that exercise, you must be exhausted.

626
00:40:35,136 --> 00:40:37,255
- Bye, Bruce.
- See you later, Brucie.

627
00:40:37,256 --> 00:40:40,536
Loving the pad. Let's
get this party started.

628
00:41:03,735 --> 00:41:05,893
Bruce!

629
00:41:05,894 --> 00:41:08,053
Bruce!

630
00:41:08,054 --> 00:41:10,413
- Bruce!
- Hey, shut up.

631
00:41:10,414 --> 00:41:13,092
My God, I thought it was number 4
and then I thought it's number 14

632
00:41:13,093 --> 00:41:14,973
and then I thought it was
number 40 and then I went to 14

633
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:16,613
and then I went to 40,
but there isn't a 40.

634
00:41:16,614 --> 00:41:19,093
- How are you doing?
- I'm good. Hello.

635
00:41:19,094 --> 00:41:22,252
- One more for me.
- You want a drink?

636
00:41:22,253 --> 00:41:23,812
- Do you have any Fanta?
- I do not.

637
00:41:23,813 --> 00:41:27,332
That's a shame, because I do!

638
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:30,091
Ooh. Wow. I'll get glasses.

639
00:41:30,092 --> 00:41:33,251
No, no, no, it's not a wedding.
You drink from the bottle.

640
00:41:33,252 --> 00:41:35,412
- Erm... thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

641
00:41:35,413 --> 00:41:38,049
<i>- Salamati.
- Ah, salamati</i>

642
00:41:39,212 --> 00:41:41,851
- Mm.
- Mm. Urgh, it's flat.

643
00:41:41,852 --> 00:41:44,691
It's not flat. It's still.
It's still Fanta.

644
00:41:44,692 --> 00:41:46,730
- They don't do still Fanta.
- They don't do still Fanta.

645
00:41:46,731 --> 00:41:49,290
I have to make my own. You just open
the bottle. Put it on the balcony.

646
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:51,610
Two days later, boom, shake
the room, yes please.

647
00:41:51,611 --> 00:41:53,570
- Ha.
- Mm.

648
00:41:53,571 --> 00:41:56,330
Are you ready?
Do you want to go? Let's go.

649
00:41:56,331 --> 00:41:58,443
You're going like this?

650
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:02,930
Yeah. What's the matter with this?

651
00:42:02,931 --> 00:42:04,683
Well...

652
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,490
everything

653
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:09,729
What are these?

654
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,849
- Shirts.
- Polyester mix?

655
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:15,409
I'm thinking 50% polyester,
20% Crimplene, 5% wool, yes?

656
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,446
- Sure.
- It's bullshit.

657
00:42:18,129 --> 00:42:22,049
Silk, smart, casual, breathable.

658
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,442
Yes, please.

659
00:42:24,129 --> 00:42:27,008
Cotton, soaks up
sweat like a sponge.

660
00:42:27,009 --> 00:42:28,280
Vest up, my friend.

661
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:32,641
Linen, flyweight for quicker
movements, show off those turns.

662
00:42:33,768 --> 00:42:36,848
Synthetic, less friction
means fewer blisters.

663
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:39,087
Unless you like blister. Do you
like blister? Who likes blister?

664
00:42:39,088 --> 00:42:41,007
- Pilgrims.
- Exactly.

665
00:42:43,368 --> 00:42:45,524
Who's that?
Can you hold that a second?

666
00:42:46,528 --> 00:42:48,686
What's going on?
Not taking my calls?

667
00:42:48,687 --> 00:42:53,806
- Just busy. I've been busy at work.
- Three words. The Velvet Pussycat.

668
00:42:53,807 --> 00:42:56,166
- What, now?
- Yeah, come on. Get changed.

669
00:42:56,167 --> 00:42:58,760
- It's a Tuesday night.
- Yeah, exactly.

670
00:43:00,046 --> 00:43:02,286
Bruce, do you have any
idea how hard I've worked

671
00:43:02,287 --> 00:43:04,366
- to get Amanda to take up a hobby.
- Mm.

672
00:43:04,367 --> 00:43:07,645
I've been masterminding Project
Pilates for six months.

673
00:43:07,646 --> 00:43:09,565
Why do you think that is?

674
00:43:09,566 --> 00:43:13,606
Two whole hours of freedom,
8:30 to 10:30, once a week.

675
00:43:13,606 --> 00:43:16,365
What do you think I'm going to do
with that time, sit indoors wanking?

676
00:43:16,365 --> 00:43:17,845
I can do that when she's at home.

677
00:43:18,326 --> 00:43:20,525
I'm just... I'm bushed, you know?

678
00:43:20,526 --> 00:43:22,525
I'm just going to have a
bath and hit the hay.

679
00:43:22,526 --> 00:43:23,678
A bath?

680
00:43:24,325 --> 00:43:27,404
Oh, that's nice. Will it have
nice little bubbles in it?

681
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:30,164
- Who are you talking to?
- Eh? Who's this?

682
00:43:30,165 --> 00:43:33,004
Hi. My name is Bejan.
Pleased to meet you.

683
00:43:33,005 --> 00:43:36,604
- It's a mate from work.
- Mate? Oh, my God. I'm honoured.

684
00:43:36,605 --> 00:43:39,043
- All right.
- It's a big, big moment for me.

685
00:43:39,044 --> 00:43:41,763
Well, I'll leave you to your bath.

686
00:43:41,764 --> 00:43:43,843
We weren't having a group.
We weren't going to do group.

687
00:43:43,844 --> 00:43:47,163
He was going to go and I was going
to have a bath. Please don't. Don't.

688
00:43:47,164 --> 00:43:50,280
Don't worry. It's fine.
I'll er... I'll go by myself.

689
00:43:51,284 --> 00:43:53,643
- I'll give you a call later, yeah?
- Yeah.

690
00:43:53,644 --> 00:43:55,523
Bye, Gary!

691
00:43:55,524 --> 00:43:57,243
He's cute.

692
00:43:58,164 --> 00:44:01,242
Two more things, your
hairy chest and a tan.

693
00:44:01,243 --> 00:44:04,162
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

694
00:44:04,163 --> 00:44:06,396
- No, no.
- Bruce, what year is this?

695
00:44:06,803 --> 00:44:10,082
Did we just go back in time?
Did we step out of the De Lorean?

696
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:12,642
Are we in 1985?
Is this Hill Valley?

697
00:44:14,162 --> 00:44:15,881
Think McFly! Think!

698
00:44:15,882 --> 00:44:18,202
- Ow.
- Sorry, I just wanted to...

699
00:44:18,202 --> 00:44:20,361
So take this...

700
00:44:20,362 --> 00:44:21,994
- and take this.
- Fine.

701
00:44:22,442 --> 00:44:24,120
You've got ten minutes.

702
00:44:24,121 --> 00:44:25,721
Run for it, Marty!

703
00:44:32,602 --> 00:44:34,681
Ah. Oh.

704
00:44:40,361 --> 00:44:42,636
Wow. It's so deep.

705
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,196
So natural.

706
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,032
How do you feel?

707
00:44:58,719 --> 00:44:59,915
Thank you.

708
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:06,120
And on the 7th day, the Almighty
turned to his followers and said...

709
00:45:10,198 --> 00:45:13,118
- What does that mean?
- Let's salsa.

710
00:45:51,717 --> 00:45:55,269
- Oh. He's grinding her batty.
- Yeah, he is.

711
00:45:56,996 --> 00:45:58,835
Yeah!

712
00:46:18,035 --> 00:46:21,833
Oh, look. Look.

713
00:46:23,354 --> 00:46:26,590
- That looks fun.
- Oh my God. They make me feel sick.

714
00:46:27,514 --> 00:46:29,273
Salsa aerobics?

715
00:46:29,274 --> 00:46:31,392
It's not a salsa. It is a cancer.

716
00:46:31,393 --> 00:46:34,030
Go back to the leisure
centre, you bitches!

717
00:46:35,034 --> 00:46:37,152
- If I had a grenade right now...
- Shut up.

718
00:46:37,153 --> 00:46:38,672
- I was just saying...
- A Middle Eastern man

719
00:46:38,673 --> 00:46:40,352
talking about a grenade
in a packed night club.

720
00:46:40,353 --> 00:46:43,792
- You'll start a bloody stampede.
- I'm saying if I had a grenade.

721
00:46:43,793 --> 00:46:46,789
- Of course I don't have a grenade.
- Shush.

722
00:46:47,633 --> 00:46:50,825
- Another Fanta.
- Let's have another Fanta.

723
00:46:53,713 --> 00:46:55,271
- Hi, guys.
- Hey!

724
00:46:55,272 --> 00:46:57,471
- So who's dancing?
- Oh, yes, please.

725
00:46:57,472 --> 00:46:59,831
- Bruce.
- No, I'm going to sit this one out.

726
00:46:59,832 --> 00:47:01,944
- I don't think so. Come on.
- Oh, please.

727
00:47:02,672 --> 00:47:05,351
- Hi, Ron.
- Hey, are you all right?

728
00:47:25,351 --> 00:47:28,349
Off. Off. Off.

729
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:29,829
What?

730
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:33,309
Get off this fucking dance floor
with your shitty dancing.

731
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:35,749
- I was doing the steps.
- Doing the steps?

732
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:38,822
Any prick can do the steps.
That prick can do the steps.

733
00:47:39,989 --> 00:47:43,588
<i>Where's the fucking heart?
Where's el corazón?</i>

734
00:47:43,589 --> 00:47:45,348
- I don't know.
- What's that?

735
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:46,828
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

736
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:49,628
Well, in that case, why don't
you piss off back to the bar,

737
00:47:49,629 --> 00:47:53,908
grab yourself a pint of bitter and
watch like all the fucking losers?

738
00:47:53,909 --> 00:47:55,541
Don't.

739
00:48:50,505 --> 00:48:52,744
Scrub it off of me.

740
00:48:52,745 --> 00:48:55,065
This filthy tan.

741
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:02,823
- Big news, ball bag.
- What?

742
00:49:02,824 --> 00:49:06,383
Shift. When you were at home last
night making love to your hand,

743
00:49:06,384 --> 00:49:11,103
guess who went disco dancing with
the sexually-frustrated lady boss.

744
00:49:11,104 --> 00:49:13,222
- Who?
- Me. I did.

745
00:49:13,223 --> 00:49:16,342
- Yeah, got that.
- Oh, my God. She can move.

746
00:49:16,343 --> 00:49:18,942
And the sweat dripping off of her,

747
00:49:18,943 --> 00:49:22,102
it was like a waterfall
of babies' tears.

748
00:49:22,103 --> 00:49:24,062
Mm, poetic.

749
00:49:24,783 --> 00:49:27,622
Ah, I think we all know
where this is headed.

750
00:49:27,623 --> 00:49:29,302
Inside of her.

751
00:49:29,303 --> 00:49:31,022
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

752
00:49:32,822 --> 00:49:35,541
- Why are you telling me all this?
- Don't be a virgin.

753
00:49:35,542 --> 00:49:37,621
- I know you made a play for her.
- No, I didn't.

754
00:49:38,582 --> 00:49:41,741
A mix tape? Are you
fucking John Cusack now?

755
00:49:41,742 --> 00:49:43,821
You took it.

756
00:49:43,822 --> 00:49:46,501
I didn't want you to be embarrassed.
She'd laugh in your face.

757
00:49:46,502 --> 00:49:48,541
I made it for her car.

758
00:49:48,542 --> 00:49:50,461
- Just give me it, will you?
- Your big arms are too slow.

759
00:49:50,462 --> 00:49:52,340
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Jules.

760
00:49:52,341 --> 00:49:54,980
- How's it going?
- Really good. Really good.

761
00:49:54,981 --> 00:49:56,340
Last night was fun, right?

762
00:49:56,341 --> 00:49:58,180
- So much fun.
- Yeah, it was good.

763
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:00,540
Helen was obviously trying
to hustle us all, but...

764
00:50:00,541 --> 00:50:03,419
Yeah, it was a good night.

765
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,019
How are your little footsies?

766
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:09,260
- You know what? Pretty sore.
- I'll bet they are.

767
00:50:09,261 --> 00:50:11,539
We, uh, stopped off at a
club on the way home.

768
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:13,379
That's right.

769
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,619
I'm going to go.
I've got things to do.

770
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:18,179
- See you later, Brucie.
- Bye, Bruce.

771
00:50:27,979 --> 00:50:30,494
Drew! Ow!

772
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:33,458
Oh, shit.

773
00:50:33,459 --> 00:50:37,137
Oh, shit. Oh.

774
00:50:37,138 --> 00:50:40,057
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, just having a manicure.

775
00:50:40,058 --> 00:50:42,694
- This came. Will you sign for it?
- Sure.

776
00:50:43,618 --> 00:50:46,210
Can you... Sorry.

777
00:50:50,737 --> 00:50:52,577
- Thank you. Cheers.
- Thanks.

778
00:50:52,578 --> 00:50:55,057
Can I, um...

779
00:50:55,058 --> 00:50:57,934
Oh, this is bad.

780
00:50:58,737 --> 00:51:01,090
Help.

781
00:51:01,656 --> 00:51:03,776
- That was so fun.
- Yeah.

782
00:51:03,777 --> 00:51:06,335
- We should do it again.
- Yeah, maybe.

783
00:51:06,336 --> 00:51:08,015
What's erm... What's with the tape?

784
00:51:08,016 --> 00:51:10,095
Oh, shoot.

785
00:51:10,977 --> 00:51:14,137
You caught me.
Er, it's for your car.

786
00:51:14,656 --> 00:51:17,849
Oh, my God. You made an inlay.

787
00:51:18,535 --> 00:51:19,975
Yes, I did.

788
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:21,814
Nobody makes inlays anymore.

789
00:51:21,815 --> 00:51:25,375
Yeah, it's just a silly, little
touch I thought you'd like.

790
00:51:25,376 --> 00:51:28,375
That's really...
That's really nice.

791
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:30,694
Now I feel like I have
to get you something.

792
00:51:30,695 --> 00:51:33,134
That would be so cute.

793
00:51:33,135 --> 00:51:35,291
That's really nice. Thank you.

794
00:51:45,654 --> 00:51:47,930
- How was your bubble bath?
- Ha-ha!

795
00:51:50,134 --> 00:51:53,173
- Was it rejuvenating?
- That's classic, Gary, classic.

796
00:51:53,174 --> 00:51:55,533
Listen, I love the craic.

797
00:51:55,534 --> 00:51:57,772
One might say I'm
addicted to the craic,

798
00:51:57,773 --> 00:52:00,132
but right now I just
want to get my head down

799
00:52:00,133 --> 00:52:03,206
and plough my way through this
bucket of balls, all right?

800
00:52:04,293 --> 00:52:05,532
Yeah?

801
00:52:05,533 --> 00:52:07,612
I think we've got a new heading
for our weekly roundup.

802
00:52:07,613 --> 00:52:12,409
Unexplained homoerotic encounters
with rugged foreign males. Mickey?

803
00:52:12,813 --> 00:52:15,812
- Nil.
- Me, nil. Brucie?

804
00:52:15,812 --> 00:52:18,491
Ah, fuck the weekly roundup.

805
00:52:18,492 --> 00:52:20,091
Fuck it.

806
00:52:20,092 --> 00:52:22,204
Oh, dear. What's wrong with her?

807
00:52:23,332 --> 00:52:25,651
Come on, Bruce. Who was he?

808
00:52:25,652 --> 00:52:27,971
- What are you hiding from us?
- Nothing.

809
00:52:30,372 --> 00:52:31,690
Aw.

810
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:35,730
Did the sexy sultan's rich bath
milk irritate your sensitive skin?

811
00:52:35,731 --> 00:52:38,050
- Fuck off.
- Oh!

812
00:52:38,051 --> 00:52:40,290
Hey, are you all right, Gary? Gary?

813
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,449
- I'm sorry. Are you OK?
- Yeah, fine mate.

814
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:45,523
- Yeah, forget about it.
- Hey, hey, hey. Don't go.

815
00:52:47,651 --> 00:52:50,209
Yeah, this is the one, the
trusty arsehole wedge.

816
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,929
Hey, hey. Don't... Gary, don't...

817
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:56,649
Stop it. Stop. Oh! Gary! Oh!
Gary, don't!

818
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:58,569
- You keep running!
- Gary!

819
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:00,209
- Right.
- Help me!

820
00:53:00,209 --> 00:53:01,645
Par three!

821
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:05,165
- Argh!
- Or should I say par arsehole!

822
00:53:05,609 --> 00:53:08,608
I didn't mean to hit
you, Gary! Please!

823
00:53:08,609 --> 00:53:10,328
Keep running!

824
00:53:10,329 --> 00:53:12,408
Ah!

825
00:53:12,409 --> 00:53:14,684
Oh! Oi!

826
00:53:15,849 --> 00:53:17,960
- Stop it!
- Ah!

827
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:21,928
Argh! Oi!

828
00:53:21,928 --> 00:53:24,685
- I dance!
- Fore!

829
00:53:26,648 --> 00:53:28,520
I dance, all right?

830
00:53:30,128 --> 00:53:32,687
Please stop hitting balls at me.

831
00:53:34,408 --> 00:53:35,806
Wee!

832
00:53:35,807 --> 00:53:37,843
Salsa?

833
00:53:38,767 --> 00:53:41,206
- With the little shoes?
- Yes.

834
00:53:41,207 --> 00:53:43,319
Yes, salsa with the little shoes.

835
00:53:46,967 --> 00:53:48,206
Why?

836
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:51,645
I was doing it for that girl.

837
00:53:51,646 --> 00:53:55,079
- What girl?
- The... the butterfly.

838
00:53:55,406 --> 00:53:56,965
The eponymous butterfly

839
00:53:56,966 --> 00:53:59,645
from the "Tale of the
Butterfly and the Parsnip".

840
00:54:00,526 --> 00:54:02,921
- The parsnip, the butterfly.
- Oh.

841
00:54:04,006 --> 00:54:07,045
What, you thought the parsnip
would win the butterfly

842
00:54:07,046 --> 00:54:09,124
by doing a bit of
tiny shoe shuffle?

843
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:12,360
Yes. I know. It's stupid, isn't it?

844
00:54:13,325 --> 00:54:16,324
And then there's Drew.
Do you remember Drew?

845
00:54:16,325 --> 00:54:18,564
Oh, yes, that horse's arse.

846
00:54:18,565 --> 00:54:21,044
Yeah. Well, he likes her, too.

847
00:54:21,045 --> 00:54:25,001
He might be a horse's arse, but he's
better at all this than I am so...

848
00:54:25,764 --> 00:54:27,876
I might just let him
get on with it.

849
00:54:28,644 --> 00:54:32,363
Yeah, mate, just...
It's probably for the best.

850
00:54:32,364 --> 00:54:35,436
Just... just forget about her, eh?

851
00:54:52,802 --> 00:54:54,674
He's back.

852
00:54:55,482 --> 00:54:58,241
Jesus Christ, Ron.
You fuckin' made me jump.

853
00:54:58,242 --> 00:54:59,797
Who is she, Bruce?

854
00:55:00,242 --> 00:55:01,755
Mm?

855
00:55:02,242 --> 00:55:07,280
The girl in the club the other
night, she's the one, hm?

856
00:55:07,281 --> 00:55:09,681
- It doesn't matter.
- No, of course, it doesn't matter.

857
00:55:09,682 --> 00:55:12,321
That's why you've got a
face like a dropped scone.

858
00:55:12,322 --> 00:55:15,480
It's just stupid. I wanted to
make her fall in love with me.

859
00:55:15,481 --> 00:55:19,120
Mm... and then along comes this other
fella... tall, better looking...

860
00:55:19,121 --> 00:55:21,757
Let's face it. His dick
couldn't be any smaller.

861
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:28,036
<i>That's why you came back.
La doña, the woman.</i>

862
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,840
It's salsa, Ron.

863
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,799
- It's always about a woman.
- Mm-hmm.

864
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,319
I just wanted you to make
me good enough for her.

865
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,199
Why don't you just keep standing
in front of that mirror

866
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:38,759
and do what you did in the
club the other night?

867
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,278
- Do me a favour and do that.
- What?

868
00:55:41,279 --> 00:55:44,318
Oh, come on. You know
what you did. You felt it.

869
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:48,275
- You want me to do it now?
- Come on. It's just us girls, Brucie.

870
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,597
I don't want to.

871
00:55:50,598 --> 00:55:52,478
- Oh, he bottles it.
- Bottles?

872
00:55:52,479 --> 00:55:54,679
What a surprise.

873
00:55:57,358 --> 00:55:59,317
- Where are you going?
- Come on. We got work to do.

874
00:55:59,318 --> 00:56:00,438
What kind of work?

875
00:56:00,438 --> 00:56:03,511
We're going to get shit-faced
and play board games.

876
00:56:06,838 --> 00:56:09,157
- Eye piece for one eye?
- Monocle.

877
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:10,597
Mm.

878
00:56:10,598 --> 00:56:12,757
Sorry, why are we doing this again?

879
00:56:12,758 --> 00:56:15,514
- Sits on top of a Christmas tree?
- A fairy.

880
00:56:16,078 --> 00:56:17,956
No, a star.

881
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:20,076
- That's time.
- Oh, all right.

882
00:56:20,077 --> 00:56:22,430
- That's for you.
- Go.

883
00:56:23,317 --> 00:56:27,355
OK, they ate this much to God's
annoyance in the Garden of Eden.

884
00:56:27,356 --> 00:56:29,236
- Apple.
- Apple is correct.

885
00:56:29,237 --> 00:56:31,635
Oh, OK, he... Um, he's a an actor.

886
00:56:31,636 --> 00:56:33,555
- He does films.
- It's a purple one.

887
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,832
- Yeah and?
- You have to do an impression.

888
00:56:36,516 --> 00:56:38,395
I'm not doing an impression.

889
00:56:38,396 --> 00:56:40,435
- Well, you have to.
- No.

890
00:56:40,436 --> 00:56:42,474
- Do the impression, Bruce.
- No, I can't.

891
00:56:42,475 --> 00:56:45,515
- Just do the impression.
- No, I'm not doing an impression.

892
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:48,747
- What are you so scared of, eh?
- I'm not.

893
00:56:49,395 --> 00:56:51,154
- Just do the impression, then.
- No, I'm not doing...

894
00:56:51,155 --> 00:56:52,794
Why are you so afraid of
what people might think?

895
00:56:52,795 --> 00:56:54,674
Why can't you put
yourself out there?

896
00:56:54,675 --> 00:56:56,313
- I mean...
- So do the impression.

897
00:56:56,314 --> 00:56:58,314
- It's almost time.
- Do the impression.

898
00:56:58,315 --> 00:57:01,393
- That's it. Time.
- Do the fucking impression!

899
00:57:01,394 --> 00:57:05,233
- Why are you always shouting at me?
- Because you fucking quit on me.

900
00:57:05,234 --> 00:57:07,993
- I did not quit.
- You had the world at your feet.

901
00:57:07,994 --> 00:57:10,313
- I did not quit.
- And you walked away, didn't you?

902
00:57:10,314 --> 00:57:11,753
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, yes, you did.

903
00:57:11,754 --> 00:57:14,233
You keep swanning back in
here and swanning out again.

904
00:57:14,234 --> 00:57:17,353
- Swanning back in...
- They broke me. All right?

905
00:57:17,354 --> 00:57:20,352
If you want to know, the night of
the competition, they broke me.

906
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:23,592
A gang of kids, bullies, they just...
they broke it out of me.

907
00:57:23,593 --> 00:57:27,431
- I didn't want to do it anymore!
- Some big boys gave you a shoeing.

908
00:57:27,432 --> 00:57:30,352
You're a male dancer.
Do you think I never took any shit?

909
00:57:30,353 --> 00:57:32,072
So what are you going
to do about it, eh?

910
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:34,952
Are you going to hide away,
or maybe crawl under your duvet

911
00:57:34,953 --> 00:57:38,713
and watch "Bridget Jones Part
Two" with some white Maltesers?

912
00:57:39,392 --> 00:57:40,751
Don't.

913
00:57:41,672 --> 00:57:43,664
Then what?

914
00:57:45,432 --> 00:57:47,190
- Then what?
- I don't know!

915
00:57:47,191 --> 00:57:48,990
So do the fucking impression!

916
00:57:48,991 --> 00:57:50,991
- Say hello to my little friend.
- Again.

917
00:57:50,992 --> 00:57:52,631
- Say hello to my little...
- Again!

918
00:57:52,632 --> 00:57:54,151
- Say hello to my...
- Again!

919
00:57:54,152 --> 00:57:56,031
Say hello to my little friend!

920
00:57:56,351 --> 00:57:58,943
- Al Pa-fucking-cino
- Yes!

921
00:57:59,831 --> 00:58:03,150
So... shall we go and dance
in front of the mirror?

922
00:58:03,151 --> 00:58:05,503
Yeah.

923
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:09,029
Yes. That is time.

924
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,949
Get the shoulders. Loosen up.

925
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:15,828
That's it. Loosen up.
Roll those shoulders. Roll them.

926
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:18,029
Roll them. Roll them.

927
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:21,222
Arms of an eagle.

928
00:58:22,829 --> 00:58:25,228
I said an eagle, not
a fucking heron.

929
00:58:25,229 --> 00:58:27,341
It is an eagle.

930
00:58:28,429 --> 00:58:30,705
OK, try again. Legs of a stallion.

931
00:58:31,789 --> 00:58:33,148
Arms of an eagle.

932
00:58:35,149 --> 00:58:36,749
Go.

933
00:58:41,828 --> 00:58:43,987
That's it. Work it out, Brucie.

934
00:58:43,988 --> 00:58:45,980
Go on, Garrett.

935
00:58:49,468 --> 00:58:52,343
Takes a lot of hard work
to make it look that easy.

936
00:58:53,467 --> 00:58:55,023
- Mm.
- All right.

937
00:59:06,507 --> 00:59:08,139
Think about it all the time.

938
00:59:11,146 --> 00:59:13,905
Now, I know you're all waiting
for this particular model,

939
00:59:13,906 --> 00:59:16,705
but as we say, better
lathe than never.

940
00:59:19,906 --> 00:59:21,658
All right, so...

941
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:29,022
One, two, three, four...

942
00:59:34,985 --> 00:59:36,664
- What is that?
- What?

943
00:59:36,665 --> 00:59:38,985
- That's chicken stuff.
- It's reggaeton.

944
00:59:52,304 --> 00:59:54,742
- Three, two, one and down.
- Ow!

945
00:59:54,743 --> 00:59:56,342
- You all right?
- Ow.

946
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,379
I'm so sorry. Someone's coming.

947
01:00:20,582 --> 01:00:23,181
Whoa, whoa! Room for a small one?

948
01:00:23,182 --> 01:00:25,061
I have a question for you.

949
01:00:25,062 --> 01:00:26,940
Well, I love questions.

950
01:00:26,941 --> 01:00:29,217
So you like Latin music, huh?

951
01:00:30,981 --> 01:00:33,901
- The mix tape.
- Oh, right, the mix, yes.

952
01:00:33,902 --> 01:00:38,540
Oh, I am a Latino boy big
time, I am, music wise.

953
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:41,459
Thanks for listening to that.
It was a real labour of love for me.

954
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:45,619
That track at the end
of side one, oh...

955
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:49,699
Oh, shoot, that's the...
That's my favourite track.

956
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:52,099
- Isn't it just so er... tracky?
- It's so...

957
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:56,259
And, er, it's the best song that you
could put at the end of side one

958
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:59,016
- on a mix tape, like that.
- Yeah, yeah.

959
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:03,578
You know what's weird is
whenever I listen to that track,

960
01:01:03,579 --> 01:01:06,938
I like to imagine myself just
lying in front of a log fire,

961
01:01:06,939 --> 01:01:10,537
just with a glass of... tequila,

962
01:01:10,538 --> 01:01:13,054
just chewing on a
chimichanga, you know?

963
01:01:14,019 --> 01:01:15,777
Oh, hey.

964
01:01:15,778 --> 01:01:20,177
That pitch that you and Bruce did,
you guys aced it, bam, sold.

965
01:01:20,178 --> 01:01:22,497
Shut the front door.
You're kidding.

966
01:01:22,498 --> 01:01:24,617
Stop that train. No, I'm not.

967
01:01:24,618 --> 01:01:26,777
I'm not.

968
01:01:26,778 --> 01:01:29,056
We should get together
and celebrate.

969
01:01:29,057 --> 01:01:30,657
- Yes, we should.
- My place.

970
01:01:30,658 --> 01:01:32,096
- Yes.
- Take-out.

971
01:01:32,097 --> 01:01:34,176
- Yes.
- Invite Bruce and Helen.

972
01:01:35,137 --> 01:01:37,009
Yeah.

973
01:01:37,977 --> 01:01:39,729
We should absolutely do that.

974
01:01:40,137 --> 01:01:41,896
- Cool, so you'll tell them.
- Yeah.

975
01:01:41,897 --> 01:01:43,976
- Great.
- Of course. I'll totes tell them.

976
01:01:43,977 --> 01:01:46,335
You can totally trust
me to do that.

977
01:01:46,336 --> 01:01:49,376
That's not a problem.

978
01:01:51,937 --> 01:01:55,415
- Hey. What are you hiding?
- Nothing.

979
01:01:55,416 --> 01:01:58,576
- What are you hiding?
- Behold.

980
01:01:59,016 --> 01:02:01,128
<i>Santa Vito.</i>

981
01:02:02,776 --> 01:02:05,335
What? It's just another
salsa night. So what?

982
01:02:05,336 --> 01:02:08,535
So what? Look at it squashy chops.

983
01:02:08,536 --> 01:02:11,172
It's a competition. Sorry.

984
01:02:12,055 --> 01:02:16,174
Don't you see? This
is your time, Bruce.

985
01:02:16,175 --> 01:02:18,287
This is the Goonie time.

986
01:02:19,055 --> 01:02:20,694
Do you know about the Goonie time?

987
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:24,653
Of course I know about the Goonie time.
My watch runs on Goonie time.

988
01:02:24,654 --> 01:02:28,053
So then you know that
it's their time up there,

989
01:02:28,054 --> 01:02:29,970
but it's our time down here.

990
01:02:31,453 --> 01:02:34,453
You can do this, Bruce.
You can win this mother-funky

991
01:02:34,454 --> 01:02:37,450
and you can show the world
what you're really made of.

992
01:02:37,734 --> 01:02:40,129
Think about it. What
have we go to lose?

993
01:02:42,413 --> 01:02:44,613
Yeah, I mean, I suppose I could.

994
01:02:45,013 --> 01:02:47,732
Bruce, we Persians have a saying.

995
01:02:51,133 --> 01:02:54,891
- I... I don't really speak Farsi.
- If you want to do something do it.

996
01:02:54,892 --> 01:02:57,004
If you don't want to do it,
don't do it.

997
01:03:00,132 --> 01:03:02,811
I'm going to be late for my
ball wax. I'll call you later.

998
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:04,412
- Yeah, sure.
- OK, bye.

999
01:03:09,611 --> 01:03:11,483
I can still see you there.

1000
01:03:11,892 --> 01:03:14,244
- See you.
- See you later.

1001
01:03:16,651 --> 01:03:19,930
Hello. One, two, three,
four, five. Yes.

1002
01:03:19,931 --> 01:03:22,570
- You win.
- Finally. Finally.

1003
01:03:22,571 --> 01:03:25,209
Now, you know what you get
for first prize, you lucky prick.

1004
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:27,250
- I dread to think.
- You get one of these.

1005
01:03:27,251 --> 01:03:29,243
- And there it is.
- And...

1006
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:33,562
two of these.

1007
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:40,409
I just thought you might want an old
pair of shitty shoes from the '80s.

1008
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:42,446
One careful owner.

1009
01:03:45,969 --> 01:03:47,409
Thanks, Ron.

1010
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:50,288
You're not going to try and
finger me now, are you?

1011
01:03:50,289 --> 01:03:53,408
- You want me to try and finger you?
- You're ready.

1012
01:03:53,409 --> 01:03:56,362
You... are free.

1013
01:03:57,728 --> 01:04:00,087
I'm going to ask her to
this thing tomorrow night

1014
01:04:00,088 --> 01:04:03,204
and I would be honoured if
you would come and watch us.

1015
01:04:03,648 --> 01:04:05,926
Ah, I'll have to check my diary.

1016
01:04:05,927 --> 01:04:07,483
Thank you.

1017
01:04:08,368 --> 01:04:10,326
Look at them.

1018
01:04:10,327 --> 01:04:12,483
- They're so soft
- Mm.

1019
01:04:15,407 --> 01:04:17,486
Don't... Don't do that.

1020
01:04:27,926 --> 01:04:30,006
Come on.

1021
01:04:37,366 --> 01:04:39,445
She's not at work today.

1022
01:04:39,446 --> 01:04:41,405
'Fine, so do it tomorrow.'

1023
01:04:41,406 --> 01:04:46,004
No, I can't. It is tonight, all right?
I have to do it tonight.

1024
01:04:46,005 --> 01:04:48,164
In that case, you are
a tiny bit fucked.

1025
01:04:48,165 --> 01:04:50,765
Sam, please, I really
need you to just help me.

1026
01:04:50,766 --> 01:04:53,604
OK, do exactly as I say
and do not deviate.

1027
01:04:53,605 --> 01:04:56,484
You go home, you shower, you
shave, you put on something nice.

1028
01:04:56,485 --> 01:04:58,483
I'm thinking powder blue,
shirt not trousers.

1029
01:04:58,484 --> 01:05:00,523
Do not put on powder blue trousers.

1030
01:05:00,524 --> 01:05:02,924
Then you get a taxi to her house.
Someone will know where she lives.

1031
01:05:02,924 --> 01:05:04,923
You knock on her door.
You knock her off her feet

1032
01:05:04,924 --> 01:05:06,403
with your confident
suggestion of a night out.

1033
01:05:06,404 --> 01:05:09,043
She immediately says yes, then
you whisk her off to the club.

1034
01:05:09,044 --> 01:05:11,083
You dance the competition.
You win the competition.

1035
01:05:11,083 --> 01:05:13,002
We all get shit-faced,
then we all go home, got it?

1036
01:05:13,003 --> 01:05:15,115
Thanks, Sam.

1037
01:05:18,803 --> 01:05:20,882
Oh, God, I'm good.

1038
01:05:27,043 --> 01:05:31,202
God, it's so busy in here.
I think I'll use this one.

1039
01:05:31,203 --> 01:05:33,362
- All right, ball bag.
- Stupid.

1040
01:05:33,363 --> 01:05:36,481
Just finishing off a little
text to Julie-Jules.

1041
01:05:36,482 --> 01:05:38,721
I told you that she gave me
her mobile number, right?

1042
01:05:38,722 --> 01:05:40,281
Yeah, a few times.

1043
01:05:40,282 --> 01:05:43,401
Ooh, by the way, thanks
for that mixed tape.

1044
01:05:43,402 --> 01:05:45,321
That was a hit.

1045
01:05:45,322 --> 01:05:48,000
- You gave it to her?
- Oh, yeah, she bloody loved it.

1046
01:05:48,001 --> 01:05:50,121
Thought it was very sweet.

1047
01:05:50,122 --> 01:05:53,001
I think I'm going to put it on when
we seal the deal for the first time.

1048
01:05:53,002 --> 01:05:55,594
You know, a bit of
sex-muzak, set the mood.

1049
01:05:56,201 --> 01:05:57,560
Don't be jealous, big lad.

1050
01:05:57,561 --> 01:06:00,480
I'm sure she'll still have room in
her life for a fat best friend.

1051
01:06:01,921 --> 01:06:03,313
You don't know about me.

1052
01:06:05,041 --> 01:06:07,199
What don't I know?

1053
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,396
I dance.

1054
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,759
I'm sorry, I thought you
said that "I dance".

1055
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,916
Yeah, I did. I dance salsa.

1056
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:17,119
- You dance salsa?
- Yeah, salsa.

1057
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:21,399
I would fucking love to see that.

1058
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,839
Maybe you will. Maybe I'll
dance you under the table.

1059
01:06:25,399 --> 01:06:27,598
What sort of table?

1060
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:29,318
Any sort of table.

1061
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:38,597
All right, bum flap,
let's settle this like men.

1062
01:06:38,598 --> 01:06:40,557
Winner takes Julia.

1063
01:06:41,918 --> 01:06:43,398
What about HR?

1064
01:06:47,238 --> 01:06:50,637
What happens at lunch
stays at lunch.

1065
01:07:17,756 --> 01:07:19,748
Ow!

1066
01:07:21,755 --> 01:07:23,795
Your wrists are limp.

1067
01:07:23,796 --> 01:07:25,548
- Ooh!
- Your dick is limp.

1068
01:07:28,716 --> 01:07:30,795
Oh, sorry.

1069
01:07:35,035 --> 01:07:38,513
- You learn fast.
- I learn from the best. Julia.

1070
01:07:38,514 --> 01:07:41,673
Sweet, sweet, rest-your-
balls-on-my-chin, Julia.

1071
01:07:41,674 --> 01:07:43,514
- Smell that.
- No.

1072
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:48,354
Did you just lick my pussy?

1073
01:07:48,354 --> 01:07:50,993
Yeah and you tasted
like a nasty girl.

1074
01:07:50,994 --> 01:07:52,953
That's disgusting.

1075
01:07:56,434 --> 01:07:58,109
Wanker!

1076
01:08:00,713 --> 01:08:03,312
I'm wearing the wrong
shoes for this shit.

1077
01:08:03,313 --> 01:08:05,912
- What the fu...
- Coo-ee!

1078
01:08:05,912 --> 01:08:08,072
Where are you?

1079
01:08:08,073 --> 01:08:10,392
I thought you liked banter.

1080
01:08:10,393 --> 01:08:13,465
Oh, fuck off, Bruce. Fuck off.

1081
01:08:19,792 --> 01:08:22,631
- Ooh.
- What the... Big mistake.

1082
01:08:22,632 --> 01:08:24,788
That's Jessie the lezzie
from accounts' car.

1083
01:08:33,551 --> 01:08:35,991
Quick step for such meaty thighs.

1084
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:45,946
Ooh, ooh, do you like that?

1085
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:50,109
- Wait, no, don't lead me!
- Like a lady.

1086
01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:52,469
- This is wrong. You know it is.
- Like a lady.

1087
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:55,109
- I'm a man. I'm a fully-grown man.
- Then prove it.

1088
01:08:59,949 --> 01:09:01,389
What is that?

1089
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:03,306
- That's my phone.
- No, no.

1090
01:09:06,069 --> 01:09:08,228
Huh?

1091
01:09:14,068 --> 01:09:16,780
Ooh! Oh, me blades!

1092
01:09:22,388 --> 01:09:24,307
Oh!

1093
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:28,427
Whoo!

1094
01:09:28,428 --> 01:09:31,666
Like I said, any sort of table.

1095
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,747
Fine, you win.

1096
01:09:33,747 --> 01:09:35,947
I can't do this every
fucking lunch.

1097
01:09:36,467 --> 01:09:39,226
Doesn't mean that she's
going to pick you, Bruce.

1098
01:09:39,227 --> 01:09:41,586
She wouldn't pick you over me.
That's just bad maths.

1099
01:09:41,587 --> 01:09:44,103
- She's a clever girl.
- Probably right.

1100
01:09:44,587 --> 01:09:47,626
You're quite good-looking.
You've got lovely, long legs.

1101
01:09:47,627 --> 01:09:49,106
- Yeah.
- Nice car.

1102
01:09:49,107 --> 01:09:51,705
- Great car.
- But there is something missing.

1103
01:09:51,706 --> 01:09:54,265
I have got something that you don't have.
Do you know what that is?

1104
01:09:54,266 --> 01:09:56,785
Type 2 diabetes.

1105
01:09:56,786 --> 01:09:58,625
Heart.

1106
01:09:58,626 --> 01:10:00,465
<i>Corazón.</i>

1107
01:10:00,466 --> 01:10:06,058
You know, I am Bruce Garret
and I am fucking salsa.

1108
01:10:06,745 --> 01:10:08,857
Get up, bum flap.

1109
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:16,460
How can you take something so
seriously that's named after a dip?

1110
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:54,181
- Oh, nice shirt.
- Thank you.

1111
01:10:54,182 --> 01:10:56,222
- Come in.
- No, wait, wait. Please.

1112
01:10:58,423 --> 01:11:03,181
I dance. I dance salsa and there
is this club called Santo Vito...

1113
01:11:03,182 --> 01:11:04,662
- Bruce.
- No, please

1114
01:11:05,342 --> 01:11:09,061
I can hardly breathe. I'm so nervous.
I'm hyperventilating.

1115
01:11:09,062 --> 01:11:11,294
I feel like I can see flies.

1116
01:11:12,021 --> 01:11:14,974
- I don't...
- Let me cut to the chase.

1117
01:11:15,461 --> 01:11:19,417
If you're not doing anything
tonight, I would love to take...

1118
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:26,739
- Of course.
- Bruce?

1119
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:30,020
- What's wrong, Bruce?
- Of course, this is...

1120
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:33,899
- Bruce...
- I'm sorry.

1121
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:38,259
What do you mean?
No, Bruce, what? Wait. Bruce.

1122
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:41,692
Come back. Bruce?
Where are you go... Oh.

1123
01:11:43,459 --> 01:11:46,419
Oh, my... Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

1124
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:49,178
Come on. You know.

1125
01:11:49,179 --> 01:11:51,898
I know? What do I know?

1126
01:11:51,899 --> 01:11:55,698
Let's say we skip dinner and
go straight to pudding.

1127
01:11:57,379 --> 01:11:58,814
Are you kidding?

1128
01:11:59,498 --> 01:12:02,977
Yeah. Yeah, totally kidding.

1129
01:12:02,978 --> 01:12:04,497
Just focus on putting
your pants back on.

1130
01:12:04,498 --> 01:12:07,497
OK, I'm not kidding. Here's the thing.
This is where I'm at.

1131
01:12:07,498 --> 01:12:09,977
I just want to be honest with you
because I think you deserve that.

1132
01:12:09,978 --> 01:12:11,416
I'm just going to say this.

1133
01:12:11,417 --> 01:12:13,697
I'm just going to blurt it
out before I lose my nerve.

1134
01:12:13,698 --> 01:12:18,451
- Oh, my God.
- Julia Matthews of America...

1135
01:12:19,738 --> 01:12:24,817
I would be honoured if you
would let me fuck you.

1136
01:12:26,297 --> 01:12:28,376
- Really?
- I just want to...

1137
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:30,615
I just want to...
I just want to do it.

1138
01:12:32,337 --> 01:12:34,295
Oh, my God.

1139
01:12:34,296 --> 01:12:36,495
Just get up and just
get out, please.

1140
01:12:36,496 --> 01:12:38,255
- What?
- Just get out.

1141
01:12:38,256 --> 01:12:39,975
Wait. Is this banter?

1142
01:12:39,976 --> 01:12:42,415
I can't believe that
you just dropped trou

1143
01:12:42,415 --> 01:12:44,255
and propositioned your boss.

1144
01:12:44,256 --> 01:12:46,735
- Did you really just do that?
- It was an act of boldness.

1145
01:12:46,736 --> 01:12:50,254
Wait, did you not tell Bruce
about tonight, or Helen?

1146
01:12:50,255 --> 01:12:53,014
- Did I tell Bruce and Helen?
- Was this all part of your plan?

1147
01:12:53,015 --> 01:12:57,094
I can't... I might have.
I don't think I mentioned it.

1148
01:12:57,095 --> 01:12:59,933
All right, this conversation
is definitely over.

1149
01:12:59,934 --> 01:13:02,654
Just please take your
little Italian shoes

1150
01:13:02,655 --> 01:13:04,893
and your pudding and just get out.

1151
01:13:04,894 --> 01:13:07,530
Can I just say I think that
you are making a big mistake?

1152
01:13:08,015 --> 01:13:11,253
I'm going to have you transferred
to plastic mouldings on Monday.

1153
01:13:11,254 --> 01:13:14,052
Oh, that's bullshit! That's
just a bad managerial...

1154
01:13:14,053 --> 01:13:17,453
You know what? FYI I didn't
make that shitty mix tape.

1155
01:13:18,773 --> 01:13:20,333
Oh.

1156
01:13:20,334 --> 01:13:22,292
I'm sorry, Julia.

1157
01:13:22,293 --> 01:13:26,172
I said some things, which
may now seem foolish.

1158
01:13:26,173 --> 01:13:31,012
OK, I'm... I'm going to be honest.
My granny died.

1159
01:13:31,013 --> 01:13:33,732
I swear to God, Drew, if you're
still there in 15 seconds,

1160
01:13:33,732 --> 01:13:36,891
I'm going to take your pudding
and shove it right up your ass.

1161
01:13:36,892 --> 01:13:38,971
Uh...

1162
01:13:53,891 --> 01:13:55,927
Bruce.

1163
01:14:02,411 --> 01:14:07,289
<i>Welcome tonight to the Santa
Vito salsa espectáculo. Let's go!</i>

1164
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:20,048
We're about an hour away from
the main competition event.

1165
01:14:20,049 --> 01:14:22,289
You like it?

1166
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:23,845
Not really my thing.

1167
01:14:24,209 --> 01:14:27,288
How do you know you don't
like it unless you try it?

1168
01:14:27,289 --> 01:14:29,568
A lot of things I
haven't tried, mate.

1169
01:14:29,569 --> 01:14:33,408
I haven't tried incest, but I'm
pretty sure I wouldn't like it.

1170
01:14:33,409 --> 01:14:37,485
Incest and salsa are two very
different things, trust me.

1171
01:14:41,688 --> 01:14:45,807
Bruce, call me when you get this.
I want to know you're all right.

1172
01:14:48,967 --> 01:14:51,887
- He's not picking up.
- He's probably crying somewhere.

1173
01:14:51,888 --> 01:14:55,887
Somewhere quiet and dry.
That's what I would be doing.

1174
01:14:56,567 --> 01:14:58,439
I think I know where he is.

1175
01:15:05,966 --> 01:15:08,362
- Can I borrow a racket?
- Help yourself.

1176
01:15:17,966 --> 01:15:20,205
So how did it go?

1177
01:15:20,206 --> 01:15:23,765
I'm wearing a silk shirt studded
with jet-black rhinestones

1178
01:15:23,766 --> 01:15:26,245
driving balls out
into the darkness.

1179
01:15:26,246 --> 01:15:28,084
How do you think it went?

1180
01:15:28,085 --> 01:15:30,361
So now what? Are you
going to stop dancing?

1181
01:15:31,125 --> 01:15:33,565
- I was only doing it for her.
- Were you?

1182
01:15:36,085 --> 01:15:38,244
So, what, are you going
to give it all up again,

1183
01:15:38,245 --> 01:15:39,963
the only thing you're good at?

1184
01:15:39,964 --> 01:15:41,643
Literally the only thing
you've ever been good at

1185
01:15:41,644 --> 01:15:43,244
that wasn't shit and
totally pointless.

1186
01:15:43,245 --> 01:15:45,123
Oh, OK, fine. Here we go.

1187
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:49,603
Just off the top of my head,
quizzes, carving Sunday roasts,

1188
01:15:49,604 --> 01:15:52,163
the Rubik's Cube,
the Rubik's Sphere.

1189
01:15:52,164 --> 01:15:54,483
The Rubik's Snake,
flags of the world,

1190
01:15:54,484 --> 01:15:57,323
driving abroad, famous dams,

1191
01:15:57,324 --> 01:16:00,083
identifying dogs by their
silhouettes, you know?

1192
01:16:00,084 --> 01:16:03,683
- African money. I could go on.
- You're wasting your life.

1193
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:06,282
What do you know?
You are 35 years old.

1194
01:16:06,283 --> 01:16:10,961
And you are working as a hula girl.
Oh, sorry, no, hula woman. Oh!

1195
01:16:10,962 --> 01:16:13,162
- Fuck off, Bruce.
- You fuck off.

1196
01:16:18,882 --> 01:16:20,962
- Good shot.
- Thanks.

1197
01:16:22,082 --> 01:16:23,440
You need to dance, Bruce.

1198
01:16:24,042 --> 01:16:27,241
You were lost. This is
your chance to get back.

1199
01:16:27,242 --> 01:16:29,442
- I don't have a partner.
- Yeah, you do.

1200
01:16:31,321 --> 01:16:33,357
- You?
- I've still got it.

1201
01:16:35,921 --> 01:16:38,076
- That's pretty good.
- Mm-hmm.

1202
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:40,881
Remember the old routine?

1203
01:16:43,041 --> 01:16:46,079
Don't. Don't do that.
Don't you bloody dare.

1204
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:48,192
Don't evoke it.

1205
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:57,200
Thunder, Thunder,
Thunder, ThunderCats! Ho!

1206
01:17:22,438 --> 01:17:26,157
'Yes, please, give it
up for Gaz and Kate.'

1207
01:17:29,118 --> 01:17:32,556
Salt and pepper, here
comes the hot stepper.

1208
01:17:32,557 --> 01:17:34,636
- All right? All right, Gal?
- Oi, oi.

1209
01:17:34,637 --> 01:17:38,277
- Hey, Helen, thanks for coming.
- Fuck me, you look great.

1210
01:17:38,277 --> 01:17:41,830
- Where's Ron?
- He was busy. I'm sorry.

1211
01:17:43,517 --> 01:17:45,436
Bruce, forget Ron.

1212
01:17:45,437 --> 01:17:47,953
You look so good you could
be fucking Bee Gee.

1213
01:17:48,636 --> 01:17:52,592
<i>'Oye, look at this.
Me la rebanco.</i>

1214
01:17:53,117 --> 01:17:55,556
'Don't ruffle her feathers.'

1215
01:17:58,596 --> 01:18:00,315
You have to go.

1216
01:18:00,316 --> 01:18:03,748
'Just what I'm talking about.
Let's go through to the next round.

1217
01:18:03,995 --> 01:18:08,715
<i>Celebremos. Celebremos. Celebremos.</i>

1218
01:18:08,716 --> 01:18:12,794
'Can we please have the couples to
the dance floor for heat four?'

1219
01:18:14,235 --> 01:18:15,594
- Are you ready?
- No.

1220
01:18:15,595 --> 01:18:17,795
Me neither. Come on. Let's go.

1221
01:18:18,435 --> 01:18:20,351
I'm sorry.

1222
01:18:36,394 --> 01:18:38,913
Hey!

1223
01:18:40,513 --> 01:18:42,112
- Happy?
- Yeah.

1224
01:18:42,113 --> 01:18:45,232
Big smile, tits and teeth out.

'That's what I'm talking about!'

1227
01:18:56,473 --> 01:18:58,631
- Holy shit.
- Wow.

1228
01:18:58,632 --> 01:19:01,192
Yes, holy shit.

1229
01:19:02,232 --> 01:19:04,628
'Look at this. The feet of fury.'

1230
01:19:05,671 --> 01:19:07,991
Hey, adios, my friends.

1231
01:19:19,031 --> 01:19:21,067
Ho!

1232
01:19:23,871 --> 01:19:26,311
I'm sorry. You have to go.

1233
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:33,222
Time to go.

1236
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:42,742
'Amazing!

1237
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:45,869
'Inspirational!'

1238
01:19:50,949 --> 01:19:53,508
- OK, I want it back.
- What?

1239
01:19:53,509 --> 01:19:55,228
- Come on. Where is it?
- Where's what?

1240
01:19:55,229 --> 01:19:58,187
What have you done with it?
Where have you hidden it?

1241
01:19:58,188 --> 01:19:59,747
- Is it in this pocket?
- Don't.

1242
01:19:59,748 --> 01:20:01,468
- It's in this pocket.
- Don't muck about.

1243
01:20:01,469 --> 01:20:03,580
- What have you done with it?
- What?

1244
01:20:04,308 --> 01:20:07,587
You took my breath away in
there and I want it back.

1245
01:20:07,588 --> 01:20:10,266
Ha-ha! Very funny.

1246
01:20:10,267 --> 01:20:14,627
<i>Bruce, when I first met you,
you were like a sangeh ghohi</i>

1247
01:20:14,628 --> 01:20:16,626
<i>Mm, sangeh ghohi</i>

1248
01:20:16,627 --> 01:20:18,747
<i>What does it mean, sangeh ghohi?</i>

1249
01:20:18,748 --> 01:20:22,306
It's like a large round
stone with some shit on it.

1250
01:20:22,307 --> 01:20:27,464
But now... you have
become of the age.

1251
01:20:28,226 --> 01:20:30,338
You are a man, Bruce.

1252
01:20:32,946 --> 01:20:34,705
Yeah.

1253
01:20:34,706 --> 01:20:36,818
Yeah, I suppose I am.

1254
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:41,705
And now you have stolen my
heart as well as my breath.

1255
01:20:41,706 --> 01:20:44,505
Where do you keep
hiding these things?

1256
01:20:45,265 --> 01:20:48,944
- I should get back out there.
- Yes. Yes, you should.

1257
01:20:48,945 --> 01:20:53,704
You go, Bruce. Go and kill them
all, man, woman and child.

1258
01:20:53,705 --> 01:20:56,384
I'm not going to kill a child.

1259
01:20:56,385 --> 01:20:59,457
OK. Go!

1260
01:21:06,264 --> 01:21:07,743
Do you have a Tic Tac?

'Musica, maestro!
What about these guys?

01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:14,743
'What about these guys?

01:21:14,743 --> 01:21:17,222
'Brrr!'

'Hey, now.'

1265
01:21:31,023 --> 01:21:32,535
Oh, no, no, no. Get off.

1266
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,134
- 'I'm sorry, friends.'
- Let's go.

'And here is fanning
the flames of salsa.'

1269

- Let's go!

Let's go!

1271

- Yes!
- Come on, Bruce!

'Double pleasure.

'Wow, that's unexpected.'

01:22:28,219 --> 01:22:30,494
You're in my yard now.

'We have our finalists!
We have our finalists.'

1276

Oh, love you, Bruce.

1277
01:22:55,618 --> 01:22:58,210
Hey.

1278
01:22:58,977 --> 01:23:01,976
- 'Let's hear it. Come on.'
- That's my best mate.

1279
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,336
'Wow.'

1280
01:23:03,337 --> 01:23:06,576
- Gary, whisky, large.
- You can win this, Bruce.

1281
01:23:06,577 --> 01:23:08,896
I haven't got much more left.

1282
01:23:08,897 --> 01:23:11,336
- Drink it. Drink it.
- No, I don't want it.

1283
01:23:12,176 --> 01:23:16,056
Eye of the tiger, Bruce.
Eye of the tiger!

1284
01:23:16,496 --> 01:23:19,815
'Ladies and gentlemen,
the floor is yours.'

1285
01:24:17,333 --> 01:24:18,528
Wow.

1286
01:24:19,212 --> 01:24:21,772
Yeah, I thought I'd make an effort.

1287
01:24:23,212 --> 01:24:25,610
Me and Drew wasn't anything.

1288
01:24:25,611 --> 01:24:28,487
That's not anything.

1289
01:24:30,612 --> 01:24:31,810
Good.

1290
01:24:31,811 --> 01:24:35,724
I just wanted to say thank
you for the mix tape.

1291
01:24:37,051 --> 01:24:40,610
It's no big deal, although
the inlay, that took ages.

1292
01:24:40,611 --> 01:24:43,210
Great inlay. Excellent penmanship.

1293
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:44,650
- Thank you.
- Really.

1294
01:24:44,651 --> 01:24:46,729
Yeah, I used a very fine nib

1295
01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:50,566
0.4 mil, it's tiny. It's probably
the width of a human hair.

1296
01:24:50,970 --> 01:24:55,329
So I didn't have you down as
a salsa guy. No of fence.

1297
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:57,249
Right, yes.

1298
01:24:57,250 --> 01:25:00,929
I was a dancer when I was
a kid and I loved it

1299
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:05,770
and then this shit thing happened
to me and everything changed...

1300
01:25:06,529 --> 01:25:09,928
until I met you and
you inspired me,

1301
01:25:09,929 --> 01:25:12,448
so I learnt to dance again.

1302
01:25:12,449 --> 01:25:14,248
I re-learnt all the old steps.

1303
01:25:14,249 --> 01:25:17,248
I tracked down my old teacher,
Ron Parfitt who's just...

1304
01:25:17,249 --> 01:25:19,488
He's a horrible,
horrible human being.

1305
01:25:19,489 --> 01:25:22,247
I shaved my chest. I went
to some amazing clubs.

1306
01:25:22,248 --> 01:25:25,248
I met some amazing
people and now...

1307
01:25:25,249 --> 01:25:30,007
finally I feel like me again,
which is what I always wanted.

1308
01:25:30,008 --> 01:25:32,840
You know? To... feel like myself.

1309
01:25:35,687 --> 01:25:38,366
- You shaved your chest?
- Yeah, I shaved my chest, and...

1310
01:25:38,367 --> 01:25:42,280
...it's very itchy, all the time.

1311
01:25:43,887 --> 01:25:46,886
'OK, kill the musica,
please, maestro.

1312
01:25:46,887 --> 01:25:51,967
'Ladies and gentlemen, let's
go, the Santo Vito final!'

1313
01:25:58,966 --> 01:26:01,405
I was wondering
perhaps you would...

1314
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:03,125
Yes, I'll dance with you.

1315
01:26:06,405 --> 01:26:08,364
- Hi.
- Hi.

1316
01:26:09,085 --> 01:26:12,124
- Do you want me to lead?
- No, no, I'll be all right.

1317
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:14,404
I was actually doing quite
well until you turned up.

1318
01:26:14,405 --> 01:26:15,960
Probably be disqualified.

1319
01:26:20,365 --> 01:26:22,161

'This is the final, friends.

1322
01:26:33,204 --> 01:26:35,719
'Let them feel you.
Let them feel you.'

1323
01:27:48,399 --> 01:27:52,355
'Santa Vito, our winners!'

1324
01:27:55,519 --> 01:27:58,757
- I don't think we won.
- Maybe next time.

1325
01:27:58,758 --> 01:28:01,757
Fab. That was amazing.

1326
01:28:03,238 --> 01:28:05,237
- Hi, I'm Sam.
- Hi, Sam.

<i>Scusi seor Garrett.</i>

1328
01:28:08,438 --> 01:28:10,398
Permission to come on
to your dance floor.

1329
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:13,637
Granted, Mr Parfitt.

1330
01:28:16,757 --> 01:28:19,110
- Mwah!
- Ah.

1331
01:28:20,277 --> 01:28:23,796
'I don't know about you,
but it's time for some love.

'So demonstrate.
Come on. Let's go.'

1333

Well done.
