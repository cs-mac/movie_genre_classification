00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,755
The Broken Jug

2
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,550
by Heinrich von Kleist
translated by Carl R. Mueller.

3
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,100
Court today-Adam, village judge.

4
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:59,495
What the devil! Judge Adam
What has befallen you?

5
00:10:00,035 --> 00:10:02,035
To stumble one needs naught but feet.

6
00:10:03,205 --> 00:10:06,205
The floor's flat.

7
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:09,575
Where's to stumble?
But still I stumble.

8
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:14,465
All of us carry stumbling-
blocks in ourselves.

9
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,570
Stumbling-blocks?

10
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,940
Yes. In ourselves.

11
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:24,450
Judge Adam, your lecherous
old namesake

12
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:28,425
became famous for his fall.

13
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Surely you couldn't have.

14
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Likewise?

15
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,530
If I...?

16
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,970
I fell right here! Understand?

17
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,520
Figuratively speaking, you mean.

18
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
Figurative!
It must have been a terrible sight.

19
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,610
When did it happen?

20
00:10:53,175 --> 00:10:58,175
Now! Just as I stepped from my bed,
My morning song fresh on my lips.

21
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,900
I stumble into the morning. My day's
appointed round not yet begun,

22
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,800
the Lord God pulls the rug
from under my feet.

23
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,130
Hm, and the left one at that.

24
00:11:11,885 --> 00:11:13,885
The left one?

25
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,730
Heavy, at least on the paths of sin.

26
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,010
The foot, heavy? Why?

27
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,920
The club foot.

28
00:11:23,395 --> 00:11:25,395
One foot's like the other!

29
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,640
You do your right foot wrong.

30
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,010
The right cannot boast of this weight
And dares to tread upon thin ice.

31
00:11:33,675 --> 00:11:36,675
Where one dares go the other follows.

32
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:40,175
And what has put your face
so out of joint?

33
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,870
My what? My face?

34
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,290
What? You know nothing of it?

35
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:47,655
I'd have to be a liar.
How does it look?

36
00:11:48,335 --> 00:11:50,335
How it looks? Dreadful!

37
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Explain yourself.

38
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:55,715
The skin's all off.

39
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,300
A loathsome sight.

40
00:11:58,655 --> 00:12:00,655
A piece of cheek is missing!

41
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,080
How big? I'd need a scale
to learn its weight.

42
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
Here. Now convince yourself!

43
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:14,525
Hm! Yes! 'Tis true.

44
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,590
It's not a lovely sight.

45
00:12:19,215 --> 00:12:21,215
My nose has suffered also.

46
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,650
And your eye.

47
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,500
Not my eye.

48
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,900
Here, right across as if a
bloodthirsty foreman raged at you.

49
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,050
That is the bone around my eye.

50
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,540
Just look. Didn't feel a thing.

51
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Yes, yes! It goes thus
in the heat of battle.

52
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:44,525
Of battle! What?

53
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,550
With that accursed goat's head
I fought, if you so will.

54
00:12:51,925 --> 00:12:53,925
Now I recall.

55
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,380
When I had lost my balance,
like a drunk.

56
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,410
I grasped in space around me.

57
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,820
I caught my trousers which I'd
hung wet there the night before.

58
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:09,925
You understand. I grab them and
I hope to brace myself.

59
00:13:11,105 --> 00:13:14,105
The belt tore and it and
band and pants and I crash

60
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,585
headlong and smash my forehead

61
00:13:17,015 --> 00:13:20,015
straight against the stove
where the goat is on the corner.

62
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,300
Adam's first fall was into bed,
not out.

63
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What I wanted to say...

64
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
What's new for today?

65
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I almost forgot!

66
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,900
Well?

67
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:14,475
You're about to have an unexpected
visit from Utrecht.

68
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,300
The Inspector General's due anytime.

69
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Who's coming?

70
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,925
The Inspector General. From Utrecht.

71
00:14:22,345 --> 00:14:25,345
Observing the district courts,
and due here today.

72
00:14:26,795 --> 00:14:28,795
Today? What? Are you mad?

73
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,890
No! He was in Holla yesterday at the
border and from there coming here.

74
00:14:34,785 --> 00:14:36,785
A farmer saw his coach being hitched.

75
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,445
Today, here? The Inspector
General from Utrecht?

76
00:14:42,285 --> 00:14:46,285
An honest man who shears his own
sheep won't like what he finds here.

77
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,200
Coming to Huisum to torment us, hm?

78
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,020
If he's got to Holla, he'll get to
Huisum, be sure. Beware.

79
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,500
I tell you...

80
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,400
Go with your stories!

81
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,400
The farmer saw him!

82
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,900
Who knows what that bleary-eyed
peasant saw!

83
00:15:01,755 --> 00:15:05,755
Those bastards wouldn't know a face
from a bald head.

84
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,100
All right, then, don't believe me.
Till he walks in that door.

85
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,210
Walks in that door! Without warning?

86
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,250
Stupid, Judge Adam! This isn't the
former auditor.

87
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:27,795
Walter's the auditor. He arrived
in Holla yesterday unannounced.

88
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,870
And not only went over the accounts
but suspended the judge and clerk.

89
00:15:35,445 --> 00:15:38,445
Why? Who knows! Ab officio.

90
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,800
Damn it all!

91
00:15:42,185 --> 00:15:43,685
Is that what that farmer told you?

92
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,000
That's not all.

93
00:15:46,505 --> 00:15:50,005
If you want to know, they looked
for the judge this morning.

94
00:15:50,655 --> 00:15:52,655
He was under house arrest.

95
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,500
They found him hanging from the
highest beam in his barn.

96
00:15:58,935 --> 00:16:00,435
Hanged?

97
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
They cut him down, rub him,
pour water on him and revive him.

98
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,290
He was saved?

99
00:16:09,545 --> 00:16:12,545
But now then they seal him up in
his house. So there he sits.

100
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,260
A corpse before his time. And his
judgeship given to someone else.

101
00:16:19,815 --> 00:16:21,815
The hangman, look!

102
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
What a lecherous dog he was.

103
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,640
Not a bad sort.
Always good for a laugh.

104
00:16:33,135 --> 00:16:35,135
But a lecherous beast all the same.

105
00:16:35,715 --> 00:16:38,715
Must have been quite a tangle
he had with the Judge.

106
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,440
This is why the farmer says he's
not here yet.

107
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,860
He'll be here at noon without fail.

108
00:16:49,505 --> 00:16:51,505
At noon?

109
00:16:55,425 --> 00:16:57,425
Dear Licht, it's good we're friends.

110
00:16:59,035 --> 00:17:01,035
You scratch my back, I scratch yours.

111
00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:03,595
I know you'd like to be judge here.

112
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
God knows you deserve it.

113
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,595
But today's not the day.

114
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,700
Let's suffer that cup to pass
us by today.

115
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:16,430
Village Judge? What must you
think of me!

116
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,410
Two old friends like us? Go on!

117
00:17:22,645 --> 00:17:24,645
Come, let's go to the Records Room.

118
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:29,765
We'll straighten up the documents
lying there like the Tower of Babel.

119
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,000
Judge Adam!

120
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,250
At your service.

121
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,250
Greetings from Judge Walter.
He'll be here any minute.

122
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh, God!

123
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,480
He's already done in Holla?

124
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,720
In Huisum, yes, sir.

125
00:17:51,755 --> 00:17:53,255
Liese! Greta!

126
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,615
Easy, Adam, easy!

127
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Send him your greetings.

128
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Tomorrow he leaves for Huzzah.

129
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What do I do? What do I leave?

130
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,750
Put on your trousers!
Are you well?

131
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,750
We're here!

132
00:18:15,305 --> 00:18:18,305
- Who? The Judge?
- No, your maid!

133
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,910
My bands! My coat! My collar!

134
00:18:22,705 --> 00:18:24,705
First the vest...

135
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:28,825
What? Off with the coat!
Hurry! Hurry!

136
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:37,550
Tell the Inspector he's welcome.
We're nearly ready.

137
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:41,465
The hell we are! Go and tell his
Judgeship Judge Adam will be excused!

138
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,650
Yes, excused! I look a spectacle.

139
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,260
And every fright brings on a natural
purge, if you get my drift.

140
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm getting sick.

141
00:18:56,865 --> 00:18:58,365
You're insane.

142
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,670
Tell the District Judge he's welcome.

143
00:19:03,335 --> 00:19:05,335
Liese! Greta!

144
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,820
What do you want, sir?

145
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:13,015
Bring the cheese, ham, butter
and beer from the Records Room!

146
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Hurry! No, not you! The other!

147
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,600
You stupid mare! Yes, you!
Liese! Good God! In the Records Room!

148
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,250
Then say what you mean, sir.

149
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,865
Shut up, girl! Get me my wig.
Where?

150
00:19:28,725 --> 00:19:30,725
In the bookcase! March!

151
00:19:34,385 --> 00:19:36,385
The man's not well!

152
00:19:40,115 --> 00:19:42,115
Tell the District Judge he's welcome.

153
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,385
Old fool, old fool.

154
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,500
You gave yourself away.
-How so?

155
00:19:55,085 --> 00:19:57,085
Embarrassed, eh?
-Me, embarrased?

156
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,730
Yes, embarrassed! Liese!

157
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,940
What's that?
Braunschweiger sausages, sir.

158
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,915
That's obvious!
Take them back to the Records Room!

159
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
The sausages?

160
00:20:15,395 --> 00:20:17,395
Sausages! Hell! The documents!

161
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,830
Not in the bookcase, sir. Your wig?

162
00:20:21,615 --> 00:20:23,115
Why not?

163
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,770
Well, sir, because you,
last night, at eleven...

164
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
Stop stuttering!

165
00:20:29,755 --> 00:20:31,755
You came back without your wig.

166
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,560
Without my wig?

167
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:38,135
It's a fact, sir. Liese can testify.

168
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,300
Your other wig's at the wig shop.
I was ...?

169
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,320
Bald as an eagle you come home
last night.

170
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,380
You says you fell. Don't remember,
sir? I washed blood off your face.

171
00:20:52,215 --> 00:20:55,215
The hussy!
I was telling the truth!

172
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
Shut up! You hear? You're lying!

173
00:20:59,765 --> 00:21:01,765
So the wound's from last night...

174
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,375
Today the wound, yesterday the wig!

175
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Last night I wore it powdered.
Took it off when I came home.

176
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,600
She probably washed it!

177
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,290
Go to hell! And take those back to
the Records Room!

178
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,810
Ask the sacristan to lend me his.

179
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,500
The cat littered in mine last night,
the dirty swine!

180
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,050
Found it under the bed this morning.
What a mess! I just remembered!

181
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,560
The cat! What? Are you...

182
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,300
Yes! Upon my life!

183
00:21:31,585 --> 00:21:34,585
Five. Yellow, black and one is white.

184
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,740
I'll drown the black in the river.
What can one do? Want one?

185
00:21:40,755 --> 00:21:42,755
In the wig?
-The devil take me!

186
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,980
I hung my wig on the chair, then
I went to bed.

187
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:50,190
I must have bumped the
chair, and off it fell.

188
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,770
Then the cat grabbed it in her mouth.

189
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,300
And carried it under the bed
and had kittens.

190
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,900
The scoundrels!
They mate and litter where they are.

191
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,310
Curse my abdomen.

192
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,725
Come, come now Grete.

193
00:22:15,885 --> 00:22:17,885
Should I go?

194
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,310
Give my best to the sacristan's wife.

195
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,810
I'll return it later today, undamaged, and
not to say a word to the sacristan. Hear?

196
00:22:25,855 --> 00:22:27,855
I'll do my best, sir!

197
00:22:30,935 --> 00:22:33,935
You jug-breaking vermin!
You'll hear about this!

198
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,280
What drivel! If one of us broke
your jug, you'll get damages.

199
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:43,525
Me? Compensated? Als ob ein StÃ¼ck
von meinem Hornvieh sprÃoche.

200
00:22:45,085 --> 00:22:47,085
You mean justice is a potter?

201
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,400
Leave her be. The broken jug isn't
her problem, it's the busted wedding!

202
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,380
I'm damned if I'll marry her whore
of a daughter now!

203
00:22:56,185 --> 00:22:58,185
Lout! Fix the wedding?

204
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:02,740
If the wedding were here, unbroken, like
my jug was, I'd break it over his head!

205
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:09,790
Be quiet Martha, everything will be
resolved!

206
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,255
Ruprecht!
-Go away!

207
00:23:12,845 --> 00:23:14,845
I swear!
You wanton ...! I don't want to say.

208
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Please let me whisper something.
No!

209
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:23,350
You'll join your regiment soon, who
knows if when you'll carry a gun

210
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,990
when I will see you alive again.

211
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,660
You're going off to war.

212
00:23:31,425 --> 00:23:34,425
You wouldn't want to leave me,
mad as you are.

213
00:23:35,605 --> 00:23:38,605
Mad? Save me God, not mad.

214
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,330
I wish you the best and God's blessing.

215
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,730
But if I come back alive an' live to eighty,
I'll call you whore to my dyin' breath.

216
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,440
Will you stand there and be insulted?

217
00:23:53,155 --> 00:23:55,155
Xxxx.

218
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
- Dear friend!
- Ja?

219
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:01,305
The petitioners are at the door already.

220
00:24:01,835 --> 00:24:03,835
Every one? We hold court today?

221
00:24:04,275 --> 00:24:06,275
Of course! I'll check.

222
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,720
This day is fated.

223
00:24:26,255 --> 00:24:27,795
How so?

224
00:24:28,215 --> 00:24:31,215
I dreamt a plaintiff grabbed me and
dragged me here to my bench.

225
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,010
And I sat on the bench before myself

226
00:24:36,755 --> 00:24:39,755
and scolded and skinned and
battered myself to a pulp

227
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,490
and sentenced my own neck to be
clapped in irons.

228
00:24:43,655 --> 00:24:45,655
In the dream you mean?

229
00:24:46,015 --> 00:24:48,015
Damnation! If not the dream,
some other fate!

230
00:24:49,105 --> 00:24:51,105
It's a plot against me.

231
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,615
The Inspector comes!
A plague on your throat!

232
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,125
God save you, Judge Adam!

233
00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:06,355
Welcome! Welcome to fair Huisum!

234
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,250
Who could have dreamt of such good fortune!

235
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,440
My visit here is hasty, I know.

236
00:25:15,425 --> 00:25:18,425
But I come in my country's service
with all good will.

237
00:25:19,105 --> 00:25:21,105
Even if my host will grant me a
sincere farewell.

238
00:25:25,365 --> 00:25:28,365
The Tribunal in Utrecht is determined
to improve the administration of law

239
00:25:29,465 --> 00:25:31,465
in our rural regions where it is
somewhat lax.

240
00:25:32,585 --> 00:25:35,585
In between I mean to be sincere
as pertains to my visit.

241
00:25:36,445 --> 00:25:40,445
I haven't come to right such wrongs
on the spot, but to observe.

242
00:25:42,325 --> 00:25:44,325
Should things be lacking, as we say

243
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,320
then I shall be satisfied if at least
they are not unendurable.

244
00:25:49,045 --> 00:25:51,045
Ah, what noble reasoning!

245
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,440
Your Honor will doubtless find fault
with certain customs.

246
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,440
You may find our office quite in order.

247
00:25:59,115 --> 00:26:02,115
Shine your light kindly on Huisum
today, sir, so that on your departure

248
00:26:02,755 --> 00:26:04,755
our fair village will set it all right.

249
00:26:05,245 --> 00:26:07,245
And this is your court clerk?

250
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
At Your Honor's service.

251
00:26:10,825 --> 00:26:13,825
Come Pentecost, I'll have served here
nine years.

252
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,510
Be seated, sir.

253
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,530
You come from Holla?

254
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:24,995
Who told you?

255
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,330
Told? Why, Your Grace's servant.

256
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,625
A farmer fresh from Holla.

257
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,380
- A farmer?
- An old farmer.

258
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:38,340
The cheerful disposition we are
obliged to maintain was disturbed.

259
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,240
You may have heard.

260
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:46,605
Is it true, then, Your Honor?

261
00:26:47,615 --> 00:26:50,615
Judge Paul under house arrest?
And hanged himself?

262
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,190
Making it all infinitely worse.

263
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,510
What looked like only disorder
and confusion

264
00:26:58,225 --> 00:27:00,225
now assumes the complexion of
embezzlement.

265
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,330
In the eyes of the law, inexcusable.

266
00:27:04,545 --> 00:27:06,545
Is your court in session today?

267
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
If we...?
Yes. First day of the week.

268
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,540
And the crowd outside there is ...?

269
00:27:15,075 --> 00:27:17,075
Probably...
The plaintiffs, Your Honor.

270
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:21,075
Yes, the plaintiffs.

271
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Good! My visit's well timed.

272
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,500
I will observe and learn of some of
the "customs"  here in Huisum.

273
00:27:29,035 --> 00:27:31,035
Let the people appear as you choose.

274
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
After this I'll inspect
the registry and funds.

275
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:38,270
As Your Honor wishes.
The bailiff! Bailiff!

276
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,380
The sacristan's wife sends greetings,
sir, but can't loan you the wig.

277
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,210
What's that?

278
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:51,625
He has morning prayers, and the
other's at the wig-maker's.

279
00:27:54,385 --> 00:27:55,885
Damn the luck!

280
00:27:56,335 --> 00:27:58,335
As soon as he's back she'll send it.

281
00:28:09,935 --> 00:28:11,935
Upon my honor, Your Grace...

282
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,000
Yes?

283
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,850
A terrible accident last night.
Both my periwigs destroyed.

284
00:28:18,455 --> 00:28:21,455
And the one I'd hoped to borrow
is not available just now.

285
00:28:22,165 --> 00:28:25,165
I'll have to hold court baldheaded.
Baldheaded?

286
00:28:25,615 --> 00:28:28,615
Lord forgive me, sir, my dignity is
in terrible peril without my periwig.

287
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,980
I'll send out to the farm, to tenants.

288
00:28:35,765 --> 00:28:37,765
How far is it to the farm?

289
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,030
A short half hour.
A half hour!

290
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,950
But the hour for your session has
already struck.

291
00:28:43,425 --> 00:28:46,425
Hurry! I'm scheduled in Huzzah today!
Yes, hurry hurry...

292
00:28:46,905 --> 00:28:49,905
Go powder your head! Where in the
devil's name did you lose your wigs?

293
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,950
Do the best you can. I'm in a hurry.

294
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,200
Of course.

295
00:28:58,425 --> 00:29:00,425
You called the bailiff, sir.

296
00:29:06,325 --> 00:29:08,995
While we wait, may I offer you a good
breakfast?

297
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:13,070
Braunschweiger sausage,
a little glass of brandy?

298
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,520
Thank you, no.
It's no trouble.

299
00:29:16,275 --> 00:29:18,275
Thank you, I heard! Already ate.

300
00:29:18,775 --> 00:29:21,775
Now go and don't waste time.
I'll take some notes.

301
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,910
You have a nasty wound, Judge Adam.

302
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,570
Did you take a spill?

303
00:29:35,385 --> 00:29:36,885
Yes.

304
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
Nearly killed myself this morning.

305
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:43,325
Climbing out of bed, you know. Fell
straight into the room here.

306
00:29:44,405 --> 00:29:47,405
Thought I'd found my final resting
place. Here. On this floor.

307
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,900
Sorrry to hear it. I trust there will
be no complications?

308
00:29:52,545 --> 00:29:55,545
Not if I can help it! No, sir. Won't
affect my duty. By your leave.

309
00:29:57,515 --> 00:29:59,015
Go, go!

310
00:29:59,515 --> 00:30:01,515
Bailiff, the plaintiffs! Come here.

311
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:11,725
Calm down, Frau Martha.
It'll be settled.

312
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,310
Settled? Hm? My jug? My broken jug?

313
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:19,625
If you're right, I'll buy a new one.

314
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,020
Is justice no more than a potter?
If your judge tied on an apron and

315
00:30:24,725 --> 00:30:27,725
put it in the kiln, they'd as easy
put a thing in it as give me damages.

316
00:30:28,135 --> 00:30:31,135
Set the jug down, restore it!
My jug, with no leg to stand on!

317
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
The old dragon! Curse it!

318
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Forget the jug. I'll get it mended.
Let me find a craftsman in the city

319
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
who can put the pieces back together.

320
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,260
Or take my savings and buy a new one!

321
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:46,310
But who wants to be in such an awful
uproar over a jug from Herod's time.

322
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
You talk like you know!

323
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Your honor was in the jug. When it
fell, your honor was lost to the world.

324
00:30:57,195 --> 00:31:00,195
The craftsman to mend my jug is the
judge who sits on that bench.

325
00:31:00,695 --> 00:31:03,695
I'm here to see honor burned pure
again, as new glaze for my jug.

326
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,250
Oh! Little Eve!

327
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:17,625
And with her that square-shouldered
bastard Ruprecht!

328
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:20,125
Oh! They can all go to hell!

329
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,625
They'd never accuse me to my face!

330
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,530
What's the trouble here, Clerk Licht?

331
00:31:34,275 --> 00:31:37,275
Fuss over nothing, it looks like.
A broken jug.

332
00:31:38,545 --> 00:31:41,545
A jug? I see! Well!
So... who broke the jug?

333
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,970
- Who broke it?
- Yes.

334
00:31:46,485 --> 00:31:48,485
Sit down and learn with the
rest of us.

335
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,330
I can't take it! My foot's in pain.

336
00:32:04,035 --> 00:32:06,035
You take the case, I'm going to bed.

337
00:32:08,475 --> 00:32:10,475
Bed? Me? Take the case? You're mad!

338
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:13,950
Oh, God! I'll be sick.
I don't care. Tell Judge Walter.

339
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,650
Maybe he won't object.

340
00:32:24,465 --> 00:32:26,465
Little Eve, what brings you to me?

341
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,690
You'll know soon.

342
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,450
By my wounds! What's happening here?

343
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
You'll hear soon.

344
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,980
Is it only the jug your mother has?
Yes. Just the broken jug.

345
00:32:38,545 --> 00:32:40,545
- That's all?
- That's it.

346
00:32:41,045 --> 00:32:43,045
You mean it?
Leave me in peace!

347
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,545
Listen to me. Don't be a fool.

348
00:32:46,045 --> 00:32:48,045
You shameful...

349
00:32:48,545 --> 00:32:51,545
There's an induction certificate made
out with the name Ruprecht TÃ¼mpel.

350
00:32:52,045 --> 00:32:55,045
If I send this, your Ruprecht will
croak somewhere in India

351
00:32:55,545 --> 00:32:58,545
of I don't know what fever, yellow
or scarlet. Or foul play.

352
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:03,875
Don't speak to the parties before
the session, Judge Adam.

353
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:06,375
You sit here and question them.

354
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
Hm? What did he say?

355
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,300
What?

356
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,730
What would you like?

357
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:21,190
You are not permitted to talk with
litigants before the session.

358
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:23,835
Here is the place that most befits
your office.

359
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:28,090
And now, if you please, I should
like to hear a trial.

360
00:33:28,655 --> 00:33:31,655
Cursed.
Judge Adam, are you deaf?

361
00:33:32,175 --> 00:33:35,175
His Honor is calling you!
Who called?

362
00:33:35,675 --> 00:33:37,675
Judge Walter!

363
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,225
What's your pleasure, Your Honor?

364
00:33:41,725 --> 00:33:43,725
Should I start the proceedings?

365
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:47,260
You are oddly distraught, Judge.
Is anything wrong?

366
00:33:48,825 --> 00:33:50,825
On my honor. Pardon.

367
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,470
One of my guinea hens has the pip.
Bought her from an Indian sailor.

368
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,540
I should cram her but don't know how.

369
00:33:59,835 --> 00:34:01,835
I asked the girl for advice.

370
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,700
I'm a fool in such matters.
My chicks are all my children.

371
00:34:08,185 --> 00:34:11,185
Judge, sit here! Call the claimant
and examine him.

372
00:34:11,685 --> 00:34:13,685
Clerk Licht, you will kindly keep
the record.

373
00:34:45,495 --> 00:34:48,495
Would Your Grace prefer to have
the trial conducted according to

374
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
formalities of law, or by custom in
Huisum?

375
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,300
After the formalities of law, as
customary in Huisum will suffice.

376
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,380
Good. I know how to serve you.

377
00:35:00,715 --> 00:35:03,715
Clerk? Are you ready?
Ready, Your Honor.

378
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,790
Then let Justice take its course.

379
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,820
Will the plaintiff step forward.

380
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,820
Here I am, Judge Adam.

381
00:35:22,585 --> 00:35:24,585
Who are you?

382
00:35:26,205 --> 00:35:28,205
- Who I am?
- Who you are!

383
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Name, rank, residence, et cetera.

384
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,270
Are you jesting, Judge?

385
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I do not jest, Frau Martha.

386
00:35:37,555 --> 00:35:40,555
I sit in the name of Justice, and
Justice demands to know who you are.

387
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,670
You stick your head in my window
to say hello

388
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:47,410
on the way to your farm.
Do you know this woman?

389
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,910
She lives around the corner, Your Grace.

390
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,610
Where the path crosses the hedges.

391
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,200
Widow, now a midwife. An honorable
woman, sir. Good reputation.

392
00:36:01,565 --> 00:36:05,565
Record her name and write: Known to
court. Questioning is superfluous.

393
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:12,110
Your Grace is not for formalities!

394
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,360
Do as His Grace wishes!

395
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,910
Ask her complaint.

396
00:36:19,565 --> 00:36:21,065
Now?

397
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,000
Her complaint!

398
00:36:25,025 --> 00:36:28,025
That would also be a jug, sir,
begging your pardon.

399
00:36:28,885 --> 00:36:30,885
A jug! Nothing but a jug!

400
00:36:32,985 --> 00:36:35,985
Put down: A jug. And beside it:
Known to the court.

401
00:36:37,985 --> 00:36:40,985
But, Judge, when I said...
Write what I tell you!

402
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,520
- It is a jug?
- Here is the jug!

403
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:47,390
You see!

404
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:51,625
Who broke it? That rascal there,
no doubt!

405
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,450
Indeed, there is the rascal!

406
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
That's all I need.
That's a lie!

407
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,500
Silence you gaping fool!

408
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,280
Your neck will soon be in
irons, make no mistake about it.

409
00:37:04,745 --> 00:37:07,745
Write: A jug. And beside it: The
name of that man, who broke it.

410
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,570
Judge Adam! I cannot believe what
I'm seeing!

411
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,190
How's that?
He wants formalities.

412
00:37:18,735 --> 00:37:20,735
His Grace is not fond of formalities.

413
00:37:22,485 --> 00:37:25,485
If you are unfamiliar with procedure,
this is not the place to learn.

414
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,205
If this is how you judge, step down.
Perhaps your clerk is better informed.

415
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,520
Your Grace said to proceed
according to custom.

416
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,860
- I did?
- Yes, on my honor.

417
00:37:41,485 --> 00:37:43,485
I ordered you to proceed according
to law.

418
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:47,195
The law in Huisum is the same as
elsewhere in the United Provinces.

419
00:37:48,155 --> 00:37:52,155
I beg pardon. Here in Huisum we
have certain statutes, unrecorded

420
00:37:54,685 --> 00:37:58,685
time-approved, hoary with age
and tradition, I assure you.

421
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,930
I trust I have not swerved from that
noble code so much as an iota.

422
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I am very well versed in the forms of
justice elsewhere in the Netherlands.

423
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,750
If you desire proof, you have only to
ask. I can mete out justice any way.

424
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:18,250
You misunderstood me. So be it.
You will begin again.

425
00:38:20,795 --> 00:38:22,795
You will have satisfaction.

426
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,200
Frau Martha Rull will bring forward
her complaint.

427
00:38:32,705 --> 00:38:34,705
My complaint is over this jug.

428
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:39,510
But before I tell you what happened
I must describe what it meant to me.

429
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,510
The floor is yours.

430
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:45,510
Do you see this jug, esteemed
gentlemen?

431
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Of course, we see the jug.
No, you see the pieces of this jug!

432
00:38:50,505 --> 00:38:52,505
This loveliest of jugs, now dashed
asunder.

433
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,600
It was here right in this hole, that
you cannot see because it is missing.

434
00:38:57,485 --> 00:39:00,485
Here all Netherland's provinces
were delivered to Philip of Spain.

435
00:39:01,235 --> 00:39:04,735
And here, in his robes, stood Charles
the Fifth. Only his legs remain now.

436
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,340
And here, here is where Philip knelt
to receive his crown.

437
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,800
He's inside the jug now.
What a blow he took on his bum.

438
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,880
Here in the middle, in his mitre,
stood the Archbishop of Arras

439
00:39:18,195 --> 00:39:21,195
but devil has taken him all together
now, 'cause only his shadow falls.

440
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:23,695
Here, houses of the Brussels Market.

441
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,600
Here, a head stuck out a window! I
don't know what he's looking at now.

442
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,300
Spare us the broken pieces, they are
not part of this case.

443
00:39:33,475 --> 00:39:36,975
We are concerned with the hole, not
the giving of provinces.

444
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,500
Admissible! The beauty is a part!
Childeric the Tinker captured it

445
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
when a Spaniard had filled it with
wine and put it to his mouth

446
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,510
when Childeric struck him from
behind, picked up the jug,

447
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,010
drained it, and went his way.

448
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:54,510
It was inherited by Feargod the grave
digger who drank from it three times

449
00:39:55,105 --> 00:39:58,105
he was a temperate man, he always
mixed his wine with water.

450
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,660
First at sixty, he married a wife.
Second, she made him a father.

451
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,660
Third when she died after having
borne him fifteen children.

452
00:40:08,195 --> 00:40:10,195
Come to the point, Frau Martha.

453
00:40:10,735 --> 00:40:13,735
Then there was the fire in '66. Then
it was my husband's, rest his soul.

454
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,660
Damnation woman, aren't you
finished yet!

455
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,871
If I'm not to speak, Judge Adam,
I will find a court that will listen.

456
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,300
You should speak, but only of
matters relevant.

457
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:28,555
We need to know the jug's value for
you so we can make a judgment.

458
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,300
What happened to the jug?

459
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:34,250
What happened? The jug was destroyed
by that scoundrel!

460
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:37,000
- Who?
- Ruprecht there!

461
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:41,750
That's a dirty lie!
Speak when you're spoken to!

462
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,250
Did you get that down, Clerk Licht?

463
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,440
You will now tell us what happened.

464
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,980
- It was eleven yesterday.
- When?

465
00:40:52,025 --> 00:40:54,025
- Eleven.
- In the morning?

466
00:40:54,525 --> 00:40:56,525
No, at night. I'd put out the candle

467
00:40:57,025 --> 00:41:00,525
when I hear men's voices in my
daughter's room. A terrible row!

468
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,500
Like the devil himself had broke in!

469
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I hurry down the steps, and there's
her door, smashed in by force

470
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
and angry voices inside.

471
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
And when I light the lamp,
what do I find? What do I find?

472
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,200
What?
I find my jug here smashed to bits

473
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
and the girl wringing her hands, and
that lout, there in the room.

474
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,235
I'll bet!

475
00:41:31,135 --> 00:41:34,135
I asked him what he was doing and
what right he had to smashing my jug.

476
00:41:34,635 --> 00:41:37,635
Do you know how he answered me,
the lout? The shameless lout?

477
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
What?
He said someone else did it!

478
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,500
Someone else!

479
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Someone else who
escaped out the window before him!

480
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,500
Something's rotten.
And then he set to raving at us!

481
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,500
Rotten, rotten!

482
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,000
And then?

483
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,500
I ask my daughter, pale as death,
was it someone else?

484
00:42:04,815 --> 00:42:07,815
She says, what must I think of
her! And swears by the Mother of God

485
00:42:08,315 --> 00:42:10,315
there was no one else but him.
I swore nothing!

486
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,315
I didn't! I swear!

487
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,500
- You're lying!
- Hear that?

488
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,340
You coward!
You want a fist in the face?

489
00:42:20,735 --> 00:42:22,735
You'll have all the time you want!
Later!

490
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,900
Frau Martha! What are you doing!

491
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Don't threaten the poor child.

492
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,000
Let her think.

493
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,500
Give her some time to calmly
remember what really happened.

494
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,150
I say, what really happened,
and tell us

495
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,640
and what still can happen if she
does not speak as she should.

496
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,020
Pay heed. She'll tell us all, whether
she swore or no.

497
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:49,590
No, Judge Adam, no!

498
00:42:50,715 --> 00:42:53,715
Do not give equivocal
instructions to the litigants!

499
00:42:54,215 --> 00:42:57,215
Let her look me in the face and tell
me that it wasn't Ruprecht.

500
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:02,430
And what's more, she's just about to.
Judge Adam!

501
00:43:03,935 --> 00:43:05,435
Did you or did you not say that?

502
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,480
Who'll deny I said it?

503
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:12,570
- The whore!
- Write that down.

504
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:15,070
Shame on her!

505
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:18,630
I do not know what I should think
of your actions!

506
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:22,130
If you had broken this jug yourself,
you could not with greater zeal

507
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:25,630
attempt to shift suspicion from
yourself onto this young man.

508
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:29,130
You'll record no more than the girl's
admission of confession, Clerk.

509
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:33,010
Is it not time for the girl to
testify?

510
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
You must realize a man can be

511
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,500
mistaken in such things, Your Grace.

512
00:43:40,715 --> 00:43:43,715
Who should I have questioned next?
The accused? I'm open to advice, sir.

513
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Yes, question the accused.

514
00:43:47,585 --> 00:43:49,585
Question him, and get this over with!

515
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,500
This is the last case you will ever
try, Judge Adam!

516
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
The last? What? Oh yes, the accused!

517
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,580
What were you thinking you old judge!

518
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,340
Damn that guinea-hen!

519
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Why couldn't it have died of the
plague in India!

520
00:44:07,505 --> 00:44:09,505
All I have on my mind is that noodle
dumpling.

521
00:44:10,005 --> 00:44:13,005
What's on your mind?
What kind of dumpling?

522
00:44:13,465 --> 00:44:15,465
The noodle dumpling I'm to
give my hen.

523
00:44:15,965 --> 00:44:18,965
If the beast won't swallow the
pill, I don't know what...

524
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,290
I'd suggest you do your duty!

525
00:44:22,835 --> 00:44:24,835
The accused will step forward.

526
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Here, Judge Adam. Ruprecht.

527
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:34,230
Son of the village cotter. Of Huisum.

528
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,500
You've heard the complaint Frau
Martha has brought against you?

529
00:44:41,215 --> 00:44:43,215
I sure have, Your Honor.

530
00:44:43,745 --> 00:44:46,745
Dare you something against that?

531
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,680
Or are you going to lie about it

532
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,420
like some godless creature?

533
00:44:54,055 --> 00:44:57,055
What I have to bring against it,
Your Honor?

534
00:44:57,835 --> 00:45:00,835
With your permission,
every word she says is a lie.

535
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,950
I see. And you will prove that?

536
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:06,450
Calm yourself, Frau Martha.

537
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:08,950
All will be well.

538
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
What has Frau Martha to do with
you, Judge Adam?

539
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,500
Well, by God, Your Grace, as I am a
Christian, too.

540
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
You may adduce what you like in
your defense.

541
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
What are you gaping at!

542
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,500
What do you have to depose?

543
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
The jackass stands there like an ox.
What do you have to depose!

544
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,300
What I have, to depose?

545
00:45:34,915 --> 00:45:37,915
Correct. You will now tell us your
version of the story.

546
00:45:41,965 --> 00:45:44,965
About ten o'clock at night, getting
close to night.

547
00:45:47,225 --> 00:45:49,225
I tell my father, "Father,".

548
00:45:49,725 --> 00:45:51,725
"I'm goin' to see Eve for a bit."

549
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I was plannin' to marry her, see,
but y'know that.

550
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,500
She's a sturdy wench.
I noticed that at harvest time

551
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
how quick an' sure her hands was,
hay flyin' like cats after a mouse.

552
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:06,590
I says to her: "You want to?".

553
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,880
She says: "Just listen to him crow!".

554
00:46:11,995 --> 00:46:13,995
An' then she says: "Yes.".

555
00:46:14,655 --> 00:46:16,655
Stick to the subject. Crowing!

556
00:46:17,155 --> 00:46:19,655
"I said to her: Do you want to?
And she says: Yes"!

557
00:46:20,155 --> 00:46:21,655
Yes, truly Your Honor.

558
00:46:22,155 --> 00:46:23,655
Continue! Continue!

559
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:27,170
So...

560
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:29,870
So I told him, "Hear me, Father?"

561
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:32,310
"Let me."  We talked by the
window for a while.

562
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,300
"All right," he says, "Go."

563
00:46:36,135 --> 00:46:38,135
"But stay outside, all right?"

564
00:46:38,635 --> 00:46:40,635
I say, "I will, I swear on my soul!".

565
00:46:41,725 --> 00:46:43,725
"All right,"  he says.

566
00:46:44,665 --> 00:46:46,665
"Go on, but be back by eleven.".

567
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,340
You say, he says, blah blah blah.

568
00:46:49,775 --> 00:46:51,775
Did he finish yammering?

569
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,415
Well, I say, "It's a deal."

570
00:46:55,375 --> 00:46:57,375
and I put on my cap

571
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:00,810
and go.

572
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:03,130
I wanted to cross the bridge,

573
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,480
so I go back through the town, since
the creek is flooded.

574
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:10,480
"By all the fires of hell, Ruprecht,
I'll bet Martha's gate is locked"

575
00:47:12,245 --> 00:47:14,245
Evie lets it open only till ten.

576
00:47:15,285 --> 00:47:17,285
"If you don't get there by ten,."

577
00:47:17,745 --> 00:47:20,745
What a low-down state of affairs.
After that?

578
00:47:22,655 --> 00:47:25,655
Then, as I was nearing the
linden arbor at Martha's.

579
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,500
I hear the creak of the garden gate
somewhere ahead. It's Eve.

580
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,820
I know by her dress.
And there was another person above!

581
00:47:33,805 --> 00:47:36,805
Is that so? Another person?
Who, you canny liar?

582
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:39,055
Who?

583
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,610
On my honor, I asked the same.

584
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,500
If we don't know we can't hang.

585
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:48,250
The rest of it! Judge Adam, let
him talk. You always interrupt him.

586
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:53,575
I can't swear on the Sacrament.
Twas pitch black, all cats were grey.

587
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
You have to know that
Lebrecht the cobbler.

588
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,500
He's been after my Evie for
God knows how long!

589
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
So, Lebrecht is his name?
Yes, Lebrecht.

590
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,715
Lebrecht, good. That's his name.

591
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:10,250
Has the clerk recorded it in
the records?

592
00:48:10,755 --> 00:48:12,755
Oh yes. And everything else.

593
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:15,150
Continue Ruprecht, my dear boy.

594
00:48:15,945 --> 00:48:17,945
I made my way through the garden gate

595
00:48:18,815 --> 00:48:20,815
and hid behind a yew shrub.

596
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:23,930
I hear a whisper, a joke.

597
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:28,375
A tug here and there.
By God, Judge Adam, the desire...

598
00:48:28,875 --> 00:48:30,675
- Terrible!
- Scoundrel!

599
00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:34,175
This goes on a quarter hour.
I think, there's no wedding today!

600
00:48:34,675 --> 00:48:37,675
Before I'm done thinking, whoosh!
In the house before the church!

601
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,250
No, Mother, let happen what will.

602
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:44,750
Shut up, you!
When your time comes, I'll tell you.

603
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:47,250
Devil take an uninvited gossip!

604
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:50,750
Then it heaves me up like a
burst artery.

605
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Air! I tear off my doublet!
Air! And I push and kick

606
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,500
and thunder when I find her door
locked tight.

607
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,300
I brace myself and with one kick
I break the whole damn thing in!

608
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,800
Just when the door breaks, that jug
falls from the shelf onto the floor.

609
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,500
Whoosh! A body jumps out the
window, but all I saw was coattails.

610
00:49:10,075 --> 00:49:12,575
Lebrecht was it?
Who else, Judge?

611
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,560
The girl stands there, so I push her
out of my way and rush to the window.

612
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,500
The bastard's stuck where the
grapevine trellis is up to the roof.

613
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I still had the doorlatch in my hand
from when I broke down the door.

614
00:49:27,905 --> 00:49:30,905
So I smashed him one on the head
with that pound of steel.

615
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:34,830
It was all I still could reach,
Your Honor, his head.

616
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:38,375
So it was a latch.
That's right.

617
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
So that was it!

618
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:48,110
The other end of the latch is
what it was.

619
00:49:49,265 --> 00:49:51,265
The other end of the latch!

620
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:54,270
I see! I see!
Now the bastard falls.

621
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:57,770
I see him pulling himself to his feet
in the dark.

622
00:49:58,535 --> 00:50:01,535
He's still alive? I climb to the
window to put an end to him.

623
00:50:02,035 --> 00:50:04,535
Just as I crouch to jump

624
00:50:05,605 --> 00:50:08,605
a handful of sand flies into my
eyes like hail.

625
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,710
Damnation! Who was it?

626
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,500
Who? Lebrecht!

627
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Who else?
I felt like a storm hurled me

628
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,500
from a mountain top to the valley
below... that's how I fell down.

629
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:26,590
I thought I'd break right through.

630
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:29,390
I sat up, wiping my eyes

631
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
when she comes and screams,
"My God! Ruprecht! What's happened!".

632
00:50:33,885 --> 00:50:36,885
I raise my foot and it's a good I
couldn't see where I was kicking.

633
00:50:37,715 --> 00:50:39,715
The sand did that, too?

634
00:50:40,215 --> 00:50:42,715
- The sand? Sure.
- Damn, it hit.

635
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,500
Yes, you know the rest.

636
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:49,005
I know the rest.

637
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Well, Frau Martha? Now you may speak.

638
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:55,610
He talks like a thieving marten,
strangling truth like a cackling hen.

639
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,760
Proceed to the proof.

640
00:51:00,795 --> 00:51:02,795
Gladly. Here's my witness.

641
00:51:03,985 --> 00:51:05,985
Speak!

642
00:51:06,725 --> 00:51:09,725
Your daughter? No, Frau Martha!
No? And why not, may I ask?

643
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,500
As a witness, Your Grace?

644
00:51:13,155 --> 00:51:15,155
But doesn't the law-book say

645
00:51:15,965 --> 00:51:17,965
in section quarto, or is it quinto

646
00:51:19,765 --> 00:51:22,765
that when jugs, or whatever, oh,
how the hell should I know!

647
00:51:23,265 --> 00:51:26,265
Are broken by louts, that daughters
cannot witness for their mothers?

648
00:51:26,785 --> 00:51:29,785
The girl is not a witness,
she is making a statement.

649
00:51:30,465 --> 00:51:33,465
That's in section sexto. But whatever
she says, no one will believe her.

650
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,840
You may come forward, my child.

651
00:51:38,915 --> 00:51:40,915
You! Liese! With your permission

652
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
my tongue's dry as a bone.

653
00:51:46,105 --> 00:51:48,105
- A glass of water.
- Right away!

654
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:52,770
Could I, perhaps"?
French? Or a little Moselle?

655
00:51:53,575 --> 00:51:55,575
No, thanks.

656
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:18,270
If I may speak my mind, sir

657
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:22,030
this case seems ready for settlement.

658
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:26,670
Settlement? That's by no means
clear to me.

659
00:52:28,185 --> 00:52:30,185
Reasonable people are able to
come to settlements

660
00:52:30,785 --> 00:52:33,285
but how a settlement in this case can
be reached

661
00:52:33,785 --> 00:52:36,285
before the matter has even
been unraveled

662
00:52:36,785 --> 00:52:38,785
I'd truly love to hear that from you.

663
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:42,010
Merciful Heaven, Your Grace.

664
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:45,590
Since law appears to desert me, I
should call philosophy to aid.

665
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,500
Then I say it was... Lebrecht.

666
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Who?

667
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,500
- Or Ruprecht.
- Who?

668
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:56,250
Or Lebrecht

669
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,840
who broke the jug.

670
00:53:00,675 --> 00:53:03,675
Who was it then?
Lebrecht or Ruprecht?

671
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,500
I see, you grasp with your verdict
like a hand in a sackful of peas.

672
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Silence, please.

673
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:15,500
As you say. On my honor, it would
be fine if both were guilty.

674
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Ask there so you will find out.
Very well.

675
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,500
But if you find out, I'm the rascal.

676
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Are the minutes in order, Clerk?

677
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,500
In order. I'm starting a new sheet,
curious to know what it will hold.

678
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
You may speak now, child.

679
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,000
Yes, speak now my child.
Speak now, do you hear?

680
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Show God and the world, sweet Eve,
what truth must be.

681
00:53:37,995 --> 00:53:40,495
Imagine yourself in front of
the Almighty

682
00:53:40,995 --> 00:53:43,495
where denials and babbling words
have no place.

683
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,500
A judge is always, as you know,
a judge.

684
00:53:51,735 --> 00:53:54,735
If he sits one today,
tomorrow it's another.

685
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:58,530
Say it was Lebrecht, well and good.
Or if you say Ruprecht, it's fine too.

686
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Whatever you say, I'm no honest man
if things don't turn out as you wish.

687
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
But if you want to tattle on another,
a third party

688
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:09,770
and name me stupid names

689
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,250
then be careful, I say nothing more.

690
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,500
No man in Huisum will believe you,
nor in the Netherlands!

691
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,900
Then your Ruprecht will be in
great distress.

692
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,750
If you would cut short your speech.

693
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:26,250
It is idle gossip and has no bearing.

694
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Your Grace doesn't follow me?

695
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:33,090
If I don't make sense to you
gentlemen from Utrecht.

696
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:35,590
Maybe it's different here.

697
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:38,090
The young lady knows what I'm after.

698
00:54:38,715 --> 00:54:40,715
What? Say exactly what you know.

699
00:54:41,215 --> 00:54:43,215
Dearest Mother.
I'm warning you!

700
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:47,250
Speech comes hard when conscience's
got your throat.

701
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,940
Fool! Like she was a whore!

702
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Whore! Ridiculous!

703
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,500
Frau Martha, what are you doing?
Scaring the child.

704
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
- She'll come around.
- Yeah sure.

705
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:03,590
Shut up, you lout!
Next she'll say is the shoemaker.

706
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,500
Listen, I've lived 49 honorable years.

707
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:09,430
And I want my 50th to be the same.

708
00:55:09,965 --> 00:55:12,965
My birthday's on the 3rd of February
and this is the 1st.

709
00:55:13,465 --> 00:55:15,465
Make it short. Who was it?

710
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,500
Let the poor girl alone.
To hell with the jug.

711
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I wish I'd have broke it!
You wrong hearted man!

712
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,500
Shame on you! That you didn't
say, "I admit it, I broke it."

713
00:55:46,665 --> 00:55:48,665
Fie, fie Ruprecht!

714
00:55:49,635 --> 00:55:52,635
Shame yourself. For not trusting
me more than that.

715
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:56,330
If you'd looked in the keyhole and
seen Lebrecht and me drinking

716
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:59,830
from the jug, you should have said,
"No, my Evie's a good girl."

717
00:56:00,735 --> 00:56:03,735
"Everything will be right in the end,
in this life or the hereafter."

718
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:06,860
"The Day Judgment is also a day."

719
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,660
God, I can't wait that long, Evie.

720
00:56:11,245 --> 00:56:13,745
I can only believe what I
hold in my hands!

721
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:16,245
Suppose it was Lebrecht.

722
00:56:16,745 --> 00:56:18,745
Maybe I had a good reason to hide it.

723
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,000
Why, why couldn't you have trusted me

724
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:25,670
and said it was you?

725
00:56:26,215 --> 00:56:29,215
Are you saying it wasn't Ruprecht?
No, Your Grace.

726
00:56:29,815 --> 00:56:32,815
The jug was not broken by Ruprecht.
Evie? Not Ruprecht?

727
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:36,350
No, Mother. Not Ruprecht. And if
I said so yesterday"I was lying.

728
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:38,850
- I'll beat you...
- Frau Martha!

729
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,400
Bailiff!

730
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:43,985
Bailiff! Bailiff!

731
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Bailiff! Throw out the accursed hag!

732
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,500
Why only Ruprecht? Maybe you helped
them yourself, held the lamp, eh?

733
00:56:52,505 --> 00:56:54,505
Seems that the girl should know.

734
00:56:55,065 --> 00:56:58,065
And I'll be damned if it wasn't
that bastard Lebrecht!

735
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:01,660
Was it Lebrecht?
Come now, wasn't it Lebrecht, Evie?

736
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,340
It was Lebrecht.

737
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,560
You obscene man! Dirty old man!

738
00:57:09,545 --> 00:57:12,545
How can you say it was Lebrecht?
Young lady! What is this?

739
00:57:13,045 --> 00:57:15,545
Is this the respect you
owe the Judge?

740
00:57:15,945 --> 00:57:18,945
Respect! Judge! Him! He deserves to
stand before the court, the sinner!

741
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:23,180
He knows the culprit's name.
Didn't he send Lebrecht to the city

742
00:57:23,835 --> 00:57:25,835
to Utrecht to the Military Commission.

743
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,160
With a recruitment certificate?

744
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:31,660
How can he say it was Lebrecht when
he full well knows he's in Utrecht.

745
00:57:32,485 --> 00:57:35,485
Well, who else? If it isn't
Lebrecht, or Ruprecht...!

746
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,500
What are you up to?!

747
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,500
Tell us what happened.

748
00:57:47,935 --> 00:57:49,935
Dearest, worthy, most gentle sir.

749
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,500
Forgive me, but I can't tell you
what happened.

750
00:57:59,475 --> 00:58:01,475
It wasn't Ruprecht who broke the jug.

751
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:04,330
I'll swear an oath on the holy altar.

752
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:08,810
I can't tell you who broke the jug.

753
00:58:10,635 --> 00:58:12,635
Sooner or later I'll confide in her

754
00:58:13,175 --> 00:58:16,175
but this is not the place. She has
no right to question me on it here.

755
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
No right whatever! Upon my honor!

756
00:58:19,595 --> 00:58:22,595
If she swears her oath before this
court, her mother's plaint is lost.

757
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
To the point. The question before
the court is the jug.

758
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,500
Proof, proof that Ruprecht broke it.

759
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
All right, Your Honor. Good.
I'll prove that Ruprecht broke my jug

760
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,500
then I'll go home.

761
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,120
Call his aunt in my defense
and I'll be content.

762
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:43,975
There in the garden, at half past ten
in the evening...

763
00:58:44,485 --> 00:58:47,485
and, before the jug was broken,
she found him talking with my Eve.

764
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
- Who saw me?
- Sister Briggy?

765
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:55,040
What kind of talk is that?
You and Eve in the garden!

766
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,500
Call the woman.

767
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
You damn scoundrel! What have you
done? I'll break all your bones!

768
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,000
Why?
Why did you keep secret that you

769
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,500
were in the garden with the girl at
half past ten? Why?

770
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,250
Why didn't I say so?

771
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,250
Damn and blast!
Because it's not true!

772
00:59:16,785 --> 00:59:18,785
Ah yes.

773
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,300
If that's what my aunt says, then
hang me

774
00:59:21,955 --> 00:59:23,955
and her to, by the legs!

775
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:26,300
Judge Adam, fetch Frau Bridget here.

776
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,500
Isn't Your Honor tired of this yet?

777
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:34,250
So long and drawn out! You have my
cash and log books still to inspect.

778
00:59:35,855 --> 00:59:38,855
It is my opinion...
That we close the court? Excellent!

779
00:59:39,355 --> 00:59:41,355
That we continue.

780
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,040
You want to ...?

781
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Fine. As you wish.
Clerk, send the bailiff.

782
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,000
He should bring Frau Brigette to the
court at once.

783
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,500
Please take some interest
in this yourself.

784
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,920
We might in the meantime,
if it would please you

785
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:12,420
take a breather from the bench.

786
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,500
That's what wanted to say.

787
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,620
Give me a glass of wine in the meantime.

788
01:00:19,285 --> 01:00:21,285
Wholeheartedly.
Greta! Liese! Come here!

789
01:00:22,805 --> 01:00:24,805
You've made me a happy man.

790
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,500
We're here Judge!

791
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Outside people! Outside!

792
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,500
What's your pleasure?
French, or maybe some Rhine?

793
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,500
From our Rhein.
From our Rhein. Good.

794
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Come, Grete.

795
01:00:39,565 --> 01:00:42,565
The bottles with seals on, Greta.
Here. The key.

796
01:00:43,325 --> 01:00:46,325
Go outside people. Out!
Until I call for you. March!

797
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,500
You're sending the people away?

798
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Yes. I thought they'd leave
with your permission.

799
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,720
Until Frau Bridget arrives.
You mean it will take that long

800
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:00,220
until someone finds her in town?

801
01:01:01,155 --> 01:01:03,155
It's wood day, Your Grace.

802
01:01:03,655 --> 01:01:06,655
Most of the women are in the
woods gathering kindling.

803
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
It could be...
No! Aunty's at home.

804
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,500
She'll be here at once.

805
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,500
Judge Adam, the wine.
But nothing to eat

806
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
but dry bread and some salt.

807
01:01:18,545 --> 01:01:21,045
What's that? Dry bread? Salt?
Oh, Your Grace!

808
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:24,545
At least a little piece of Limberg

809
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:27,415
to bring out the taste in the wine.

810
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,300
A piece of cheese, but no more.

811
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:35,500
Butter, eggs, whole breast, ham
and swift!

812
01:01:36,085 --> 01:01:38,085
And white, the damask cloth.

813
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,840
On the table.

814
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:49,495
Everything' s bad indeed,
but now it's right.

815
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,500
I wanted to ask.

816
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,800
How did you come by that
wound, Judge?

817
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:03,520
That's a nasty hole in
your head indeed!

818
01:02:05,835 --> 01:02:08,835
- I fell.
- You fell. I see.

819
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:12,330
- When? Last night?
- Today.

820
01:02:12,855 --> 01:02:15,355
Half past six. This morning.
Early.

821
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:18,870
As I stepped from my bed.
Over what?

822
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,100
Over...

823
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,240
To tell the you the truth.

824
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:28,850
Over myself. Directly, head
first, into the stove there.

825
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:32,070
Backwards?

826
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:35,250
- How backwards?
- Or the front.

827
01:02:35,975 --> 01:02:37,975
You have two wounds, fore and aft.

828
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:41,850
Fore and aft.
First here, then there.

829
01:02:42,765 --> 01:02:45,765
First on the stove's sharp edge
that knocked in my forehead

830
01:02:47,645 --> 01:02:49,645
then backwards, off the stove.

831
01:02:50,335 --> 01:02:52,335
I fell to the floor and hit my head.

832
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:58,660
Dangerous.

833
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:07,260
If you had a wife, I'd imagine all
sorts of fantastical things, Judge.

834
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:12,085
- How's that?
- I swear

835
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,600
you're scratched up all over.

836
01:03:15,365 --> 01:03:17,365
No, thank God!

837
01:03:17,865 --> 01:03:19,865
No, not a woman's nails!

838
01:03:20,365 --> 01:03:23,365
And to lose your wig today under
such circumstances.

839
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:26,890
The wig, I think, might almost have
hidden your wounds.

840
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:29,390
Yes, yes, well, evils come in pairs.

841
01:03:30,795 --> 01:03:33,795
Here you are.
Butter, freshly churned.

842
01:03:35,865 --> 01:03:37,865
And cheese from Limburg.

843
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:41,900
- Can I?
- A small piece.

844
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:46,500
Mmm, from Limburg.
Fresh from Limburg!

845
01:03:47,025 --> 01:03:49,025
And from the fat goose breast.

846
01:03:52,215 --> 01:03:54,215
- Like some?
- No.

847
01:03:55,805 --> 01:03:58,805
Now, how the devil did
you say it happened?

848
01:03:59,685 --> 01:04:02,185
That you... that you lost
your wig?

849
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,500
Yes.

850
01:04:10,195 --> 01:04:12,195
I sat here last night

851
01:04:13,085 --> 01:04:15,585
and read a brief.
Then I misplaced my glasses.

852
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,460
But I was so deep in the argument

853
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:22,390
that the candle set my wig ablaze.

854
01:04:24,945 --> 01:04:27,945
I thought Heaven had sent
fire on my sinful pate!

855
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:31,950
I grabbed to rip it off and throw it
from me but the bands were stuck

856
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:35,900
and up it flamed like
Sodom and Gomorrah!

857
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:41,160
I scarcely escaped with the last
three hairs on my head!

858
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:45,910
Cursed! And the other's sent to town!

859
01:04:47,655 --> 01:04:49,655
Yes, with the wigmaker.

860
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
- Niersteiner?
- What?

861
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:59,750
Or a good Oppenheimer?

862
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:03,250
Niersteiner. Or a good Oppenheimer.
From Nierstein or Oppenheim.

863
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Where did you strike the sinner?
On the head, did you say?

864
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,500
Leave it! It's still half full!
I'll fill it for good measure.

865
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:15,500
How many times did you hit the
sinner on the head?

866
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Me?
Him! Ruprecht! I'm asking you!

867
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
How often did you hit the scapegoat?

868
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Out with it!
With the door handle?

869
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Twice.
Scoundrel, he remembered.

870
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:33,750
Twice. You might have killed with two
such blows, you know?

871
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
If I killed him, at least I'd know
who it was. It's what I wanted.

872
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:42,500
If he was in front of me dead,
then I could say I wasn't lying.

873
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,500
Dead! Hm! I can believe it.

874
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,500
That's what we like, Your Grace.

875
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,000
What's right and good and true,
Judge Adam!

876
01:05:58,055 --> 01:06:00,055
There! There comes Frau Brigitte!

877
01:06:02,785 --> 01:06:05,785
Very well then, Judge Adam, let's
bring this case to a close.

878
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:19,370
Here is Frau Brigitte, Your Honor.

879
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Is that Frau Bridgitte Judge Adam?

880
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:27,970
If that's Frau Brigitte?
Yes it is, your Honor.

881
01:06:30,205 --> 01:06:33,205
What kind of periwig has
Frau Bridgitte brought to us?

882
01:06:34,970 --> 01:06:36,970
Your Honor?

883
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,500
What kind of wig has she brought?

884
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,000
- What?
- Pardon, sir...

885
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,500
Do we know to whom it belongs?

886
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
If Your Honor would have Judge Adam
question the woman, he'll learn

887
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:53,700
whose wig this is, as well as
other matters, I have no doubt.

888
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:59,250
How did the woman come to this?
Where did she find the wig?

889
01:06:59,775 --> 01:07:02,775
She found it in the trellis at
Frau Martha Rull's.

890
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:06,370
Skewered like a bird's nest in
the tangled grapevines.

891
01:07:07,275 --> 01:07:10,275
Directly under the window where
the girl sleeps.

892
01:07:10,775 --> 01:07:12,775
What? In my trellis?

893
01:07:20,165 --> 01:07:22,165
Judge Adam.

894
01:07:22,665 --> 01:07:24,665
If you have anything to confide to me.

895
01:07:26,225 --> 01:07:29,225
I ask for the honor of the court
that you had best tell me now.

896
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,880
I? To you?
No? You have nothing?

897
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,900
Upon my honor, sir...

898
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:39,250
This wig, is it not yours?

899
01:07:39,875 --> 01:07:41,875
This wig...

900
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:48,250
Yes! It is mine!

901
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:52,690
On my soul this is the wig I gave
that fellow over there

902
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,500
eight days ago to bring to Master
Mehl in Utrecht.

903
01:07:57,445 --> 01:07:59,945
- What? To whom?
- To Ruprecht?

904
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:03,830
Me?
Did I not give my wig to this rogue

905
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:07,330
on his way to Utrecht, entrusted
it to him

906
01:08:08,045 --> 01:08:11,045
to bring to the barber to have
it restored?

907
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:13,610
Yes, well, sure, you gave it to me.

908
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:17,250
Why, then, scoundrel, did you not
deliver it to the master's workshop?

909
01:08:18,145 --> 01:08:21,145
Why? Damn and blast I did give
it to the master and he took it.

910
01:08:22,225 --> 01:08:24,225
So you gave it to him.

911
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:29,520
So now it hangs in Frau Martha's
grapevine? Wait, scoundrel.

912
01:08:31,435 --> 01:08:33,435
You won't get out of this that easy!

913
01:08:33,935 --> 01:08:36,935
I suspect some masquerading,
not to mention mutiny!

914
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
With your permission, may I question
this woman at once, Your Grace?

915
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:44,560
You say you had the wig...
Your Honor, Tuesday last, that boy

916
01:08:45,225 --> 01:08:48,225
was driving his father's ox team
to Utrecht, he asked.

917
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:51,910
"Judge Adam, is there any business
I can do for you in town?".

918
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:55,750
"Yes, you can take in my wig
to be repaired," I told him.

919
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,880
But I didn't tell him: "Keep it for
yourself, and disguise yourself"

920
01:09:01,035 --> 01:09:04,035
and leave it hanging in the trellis
at Frau Martha Rull's"!

921
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,250
Gentlemen. Honored sirs.

922
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:10,810
By your Grace it was certainly
not Ruprecht.

923
01:09:12,225 --> 01:09:15,225
Last night, when I went out to
to the farm

924
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:18,185
to my aunt, heavy with child

925
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:20,975
voices from the back of the garden.

926
01:09:21,645 --> 01:09:24,645
I heard Eve scold someone
hoarsely "Fie! For shame!"

927
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
"Disgusting creature! What are you
doing! Go away!"

928
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,500
"I'll call my mother!".

929
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
And then I called through the hedge.

930
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:37,500
"Eve!" I called, "What's wrong?
What is it?".

931
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,500
Then it became silent.

932
01:09:43,415 --> 01:09:45,415
As I was coming back from the farm

933
01:09:46,705 --> 01:09:48,705
the time was around midnight.

934
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:52,740
Right when I was on the linden path
near Martha's.

935
01:09:53,495 --> 01:09:55,495
Whoosh, a man rushed by

936
01:09:58,675 --> 01:10:00,675
baldheaded, with a horse's foot

937
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:04,260
and his wake stank

938
01:10:05,475 --> 01:10:08,475
of smoke and pitch
and hair and brimstone.

939
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:12,280
I said "Old Nick"

940
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,900
and turned horrified to watch

941
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,640
and saw, my soul!

942
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:22,560
The bald head, good sirs,
in the distance

943
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:25,660
like a sparkler

944
01:10:26,445 --> 01:10:28,445
lighting the linden path.

945
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,350
Good God!

946
01:10:31,995 --> 01:10:34,995
Are you mad, Frau Briggy?
You mean it was the devil?

947
01:10:36,025 --> 01:10:39,025
My soul! I know what I
saw and smelled.

948
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:42,300
Clerk Licht can bear me witness.

949
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:46,270
If it was the devil I don't know.

950
01:10:47,045 --> 01:10:50,045
The horse's foot, the
stark bald head

951
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:53,820
and the smoke, unless I'm mistaken,
that's entirely true!

952
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,600
Continue.
Today when I heard, amazed

953
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:02,740
what happened at Frau Rull's.

954
01:11:03,165 --> 01:11:06,165
I thought maybe I could help
discover who broke the jug.

955
01:11:07,435 --> 01:11:10,435
So I go to look at the spot under
the trellis where he made his jump.

956
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:15,820
I found, gentlemen, tracks
in the snow.

957
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,600
And what kind of track I found!

958
01:11:20,965 --> 01:11:23,965
The right was fine and sharp
and well formed.

959
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:27,810
An ordinary man's foot.

960
01:11:28,705 --> 01:11:30,705
And the left was deformed, coarse

961
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:33,430
clumsy, monstrous

962
01:11:34,025 --> 01:11:37,025
a clump like a horse's foot.

963
01:11:39,305 --> 01:11:41,305
It can't be true...

964
01:11:41,865 --> 01:11:44,865
On my word. First, by the trellis,
where he jumped

965
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,600
there's a wide circle of snow that's
trodden down

966
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,100
like a sow wallowed there.
A sow?

967
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:55,310
And human foot, horse's foot.
Horse's foot from here.

968
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:59,500
And human's foot, and horse's foot.

969
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Across the garden and
out into the world.

970
01:12:16,805 --> 01:12:19,805
Gentlemen, this seems to be
in earnest.

971
01:12:20,305 --> 01:12:22,305
I propose we inquire of the Synod

972
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
in the Hague whether this court is
authorized to assume

973
01:12:27,185 --> 01:12:29,185
that Beelzebub broke this jug.

974
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,840
The answer I expected from you.

975
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:36,200
Your Grace will not need the Synod
to come to a judgment.

976
01:12:36,805 --> 01:12:39,805
Allow Frau Brigitte to finish.
I say: "Your Clerkship, Mr. Licht,".

977
01:12:41,615 --> 01:12:44,615
"Let's follow these tracks
for a little while,"

978
01:12:45,345 --> 01:12:47,345
"to see where the Devil escaped to."

979
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:51,220
And he says, "Good, Frau Bridget,".

980
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:53,720
"Good idea."

981
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:57,250
"Perhaps we shouldn't go far
if we go to Justice Adam's door.".

982
01:12:59,805 --> 01:13:01,805
I want to know where the tracks led!

983
01:13:02,275 --> 01:13:05,275
Where? On my honor, here to you.

984
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
To us here? To this house?
Here, I say, to Judge Adam's.

985
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:13,260
- To Judge Adam's?
- Here, to me?

986
01:13:13,725 --> 01:13:16,725
To you.
How can the devil live in a Court?

987
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,800
I swear, I don't know if
he lives here

988
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:26,670
but I'm sure of this: He paid
a visit.

989
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:30,170
The tracks go behind here
to the threshold.

990
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:32,670
Think he passed... through?

991
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:37,750
Yes, or passed through.

992
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:41,500
- Could be.
- Yes! Passed through!

993
01:13:42,185 --> 01:13:45,185
I'm no honest man if there's not
something rotten in the Registry.

994
01:13:46,225 --> 01:13:48,225
And if my records are in confusion

995
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:51,925
as I suspect, by my honor,
I will vouch for nothing.

996
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:54,250
Nor I. Tell me something, gentlemen.

997
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:57,750
Is there anyone in the area with
ill-shaped feet?

998
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:00,250
Indeed, here in Huisum.

999
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:04,250
So? Who?
Your Grace, please ask the Judge.

1000
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:07,750
- Judge Adam?
- Not that I know!

1001
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:10,250
For all I know, all's grown straight.

1002
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:12,750
Stick your feet on out here!

1003
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:16,250
You stick them under the desk
as if you left the tracks!

1004
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:19,750
Me? The tracks? Am I the devil?

1005
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:23,220
Is this a horse's foot?

1006
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:26,720
If the devil had this foot he'd be
at every dance.

1007
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
I told you to close this session.

1008
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:33,500
The only scruple left is caused by
this here solemn instrument.

1009
01:14:35,435 --> 01:14:38,435
What! What solemn instrument?
Here! This wig!

1010
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Whoever's seen a devil in this!

1011
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
In this country we know but darkly

1012
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:49,820
the newest fashions in Hell,
Frau Brigitte.

1013
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,320
They say he usually wears
his own hair

1014
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:57,060
but when on earth I am convinced
he throws on a wig

1015
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,560
to mix among the well to do.

1016
01:15:00,145 --> 01:15:03,145
You wretch! For you to speak in
such disgrace in the Tribunal!

1017
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:07,870
Only the honor of the court protects
you! Close the session!

1018
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:11,750
I hope you won't.
You hope nothing! Retire now!

1019
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:15,500
You believe yesterday that I, a
judge, left my wig in a grapevine?

1020
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:20,050
God forbid! Your wig went up in
flames, like Sodom and Gomorrah!

1021
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:26,170
No, Your Grace, yesterday evening
the cat littered in his wig.

1022
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:30,780
Gentlemen! If appearances condemn
me, I must beg you not to be hasty.

1023
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:34,320
I sit here upon this judge's bench
of the Court of Huisum

1024
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:36,820
and I put this periwig on this table.

1025
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:40,320
He who claims it's mine will be
summoned to the court in Utrecht!

1026
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,500
But the wig fits very well indeed!
As if you'd grown it there!

1027
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
- Slander!
- No?

1028
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,500
That terrible bufoon!

1029
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I'll get you! And this time you
won't throw sand in my eyes!

1030
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:56,500
If you allow, now I sentence.
Good. Do that. Decide.

1031
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Ruprecht there, that vermin
is the culprit.

1032
01:16:02,015 --> 01:16:05,015
I condemn his neck to an iron collar.
For indecent behavior, Your Grace

1033
01:16:05,515 --> 01:16:08,515
I'll throw him behind bars.
For how long I'll decide later.

1034
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
- Ruprecht ...?
- In jail?

1035
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,500
In irons? Him there, he's shameless!

1036
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:18,860
It was him"Judge Adam!
He broke the jug!

1037
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,500
What? Him? Him!

1038
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I'll grab him!

1039
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:29,500
Up Ruprecht!
Smash him off the bench!

1040
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,500
Insolence! I want order!

1041
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Now it's clear!

1042
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,500
Stop him! Stop him!

1043
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:50,840
Damn and blast!

1044
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,500
- Ruprecht!
- My sacred jug!

1045
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:57,380
Damn him!

1046
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,500
Hurry, Clerk. Bring him back.

1047
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:44,500
He's suspended from his post
and I assign to you

1048
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:48,500
his duties until further notice,
so you can govern the village.

1049
01:17:50,195 --> 01:17:53,195
But if the accounts are in
order as I hope.

1050
01:17:53,695 --> 01:17:55,695
I won't be the one to disbar him.

1051
01:17:56,195 --> 01:17:58,195
Go, be so kind as to bring him back!

1052
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Your Grace, if you won't help
us now we'll be lost.

1053
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:06,750
- Lost? How so?
- My Ruprecht!

1054
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:10,750
Judge Adam said they send the new
conscripts to the East Indies.

1055
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:14,750
And you know, only one in three
from there comes home alive!

1056
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:17,260
What? The East Indies? Are you mad?

1057
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:21,250
The troops recently drafted will
serve at home.

1058
01:18:21,805 --> 01:18:24,805
It wouldn't occur to anyone to send
them to the East Indies!

1059
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:28,310
Sir, is that true?
On my honor.

1060
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:32,810
And if that were true for Ruprecht,
I'd buy his way out.

1061
01:18:37,585 --> 01:18:39,585
Come!

1062
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:43,120
Little Eve, how shamefully
I insulted you today!

1063
01:18:43,675 --> 01:18:45,675
You're my golden girl, my bride!

1064
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,120
Will you spend your life with me?

1065
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:51,570
How that villain lied about me!
Let's forget about old horsefoot!

1066
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:55,895
But if a horse had broken the jug
I'd be just as jealous as now.

1067
01:19:01,725 --> 01:19:04,725
Your Grace! Your Grace!
What is it?

1068
01:19:05,225 --> 01:19:07,225
Where is the high court in Utrecht?

1069
01:19:07,725 --> 01:19:09,725
On the Great Market Square.

1070
01:19:10,225 --> 01:19:13,225
Wherefore?
My jug should find justice, too.

1071
01:19:13,725 --> 01:19:15,725
Sessions are Tuesday and Friday.

1072
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:19,500
Good! Next week I'll present
myself there.

1073
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:23,200
The End.
