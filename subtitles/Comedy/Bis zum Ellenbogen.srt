1
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:39,720
UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD
THE TRILOGY

2
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,320
PART ONE

3
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,760
<i>1999 was the year the Indian nuclear
satellite went out of control.</i>

4
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,760
<i>No one knew where it might land.</i>

5
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,520
<i>It soared above the ozone layer
like a lethal bird of prey.</i>

6
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,000
<i>The whole world was alarmed.
Only Claire couldn't care less.</i>

7
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,920
<i>At the time she was living her own nightmare.</i>

8
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,229
<i>The same dream arrived each night:
she was gliding over an unknown land,</i>

9
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:06,640
<i>pleasantly at first, but then
the gliding would turn into falling.</i>

10
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,960
<i>falling into panic, and then she'd wake up.</i>

11
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,840
- Pietro!
- Why are you still here?

12
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,360
You saw that guy in the green room, remember?

13
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,360
- He's a creep!
- He won't wake up.

14
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,200
Stayed release drugs. Fucking dangerous.

15
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,120
- Do you mind...
- Phone Dr. Fabrini again? Sure.

16
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:03,400
<i>Pietro,
You should be in bed.</i>

17
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,720
I don't sleep anymore, doctor.
Sleeping is "out".

18
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,160
<i>All of us who knew Claire well</i>

19
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,720
<i>loved her for her optimism,
her energy and her courage.</i>

20
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,963
<i>We remembered these things about her
just as we'd like to forget her capacity for self destruction.</i>

21
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:28,160
<i>They were all a part of her and we accepted that.</i>

22
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:35,200
<i>When Claire had left me,
I'd shut myself off completely.</i>

23
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,680
<i>I didn't see anybody,
and avoided leaving the apartment.</i>

24
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,400
<i>In my solitude, things happened to me.</i>

25
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,392
<i>I started to pray again, as I had long ago.</i>

26
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:50,200
<i>Hesitantly at first but
accepting the good that it did me.</i>

27
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,080
<i>And out of this peace,
came the beginning of my first novel.</i>

28
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,960
<i>Claire was it's leading character.
It began "For two months..."</i>

29
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,920
<i>drifted through the parties,
the designer drugs, the one night stands.</i>

30
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,958
<i>seeking excuses to obliterate herself,</i>

31
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:13,800
<i>until she realized that if she was to go on living,
she couldn't go on living like this.  </i>

32
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:41,560
<i>Hello, Claire. Your dashboard computer system
is now online performing car initialization.</i>

33
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,120
<i>Press 1 to activate the electronic map service.</i>

34
00:08:53,728 --> 00:09:02,335
Never thought that I'd travel all alone
The trail of memories

35
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:04,855
Happy hours, lonely years

36
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:09,589
<i>Friendly reminder that you're over the speed limit, Claire.</i>

37
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:29,914
The fire of love, the fire of love
Can burn from afar

38
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:37,991
And nothing can light the dark of the night
Like a falling star

39
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:46,928
Summer kisses, Winter tears
Like the stars they fade away

40
00:09:47,048 --> 00:09:54,281
Leaving me to spend my lonely nights
With dreams of yesterday

41
00:09:55,948 --> 00:09:57,424
Leaving me...

42
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,760
<i>Traffic congested for the next 30km.</i>

43
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,840
<i>Unable to provide alternative route.</i>

44
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,960
<i>I'm sorry, Claire.</i>

45
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,174
<i>The satellite emergency created traffic jams,</i>

46
00:10:39,294 --> 00:10:43,532
<i>wherever people fled areas of possible impact,
like the south of France.</i>

47
00:10:44,074 --> 00:10:48,920
<i>Only Claire, impatient as ever, fled the
traffic jam and chose to thrust herself</i>

48
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,626
<i>into the unknown.</i>

49
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,600
<i>In doing so, she changed the direction
of her life, of all our lives.</i>

50
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,760
<i>You are leaving the map zone database.
You are on your own, Claire.</i>

51
00:13:44,612 --> 00:13:47,240
<i>Claire felt strangely light.</i>

52
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,560
<i>She knew she'd been meant to die here,
on the high plateau of the Lozère.</i>

53
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,240
<i>It was a miracle she was alive.</i>

54
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,714
<i>The angels had somehow made a mistake in their accounting</i>

55
00:13:57,834 --> 00:13:59,974
<i>and had left her with a precious gift.<i>

56
00:14:00,813 --> 00:14:02,910
<i>She'd been given a whole new life</i>

57
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,976
<i>that she could use this time, to be a better person.</i>

58
00:14:07,582 --> 00:14:09,108
<i>She could be of service.<i>

59
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,720
<i>All she needed was an opportunity, a mission.</i>

60
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,234
- Shit!
- Yes...

61
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,471
- She didn't see us, Raymond.
- I'm sorry, we were not introduced.

62
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,397
- Claire Tourneur.
- I am Raymond, He's Chico.

63
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,874
Chico, you could apologize to...
Madame Tourneur.

64
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,075
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not.

65
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,756
I'm sorry, I've been an idiot.

66
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,192
I'm sorry.

67
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,358
Will your car still work?

68
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,480
People always want to give definitions.
You say "Rock'n Roll"

69
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,114
they ask, "Which kind?".

70
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,996
But I just play rock'n roll.
I'm a drummer.

71
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,040
- Did you hear him playing?
- He's been breaking my head for 15 years.

72
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,760
Raymond is the same. When he says
he is buddhist, people go crazy.

73
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,480
- They can't stand him!
- It's not the same.

74
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,360
There's nothing wrong in
being buddhist.

75
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,950
- In his job, yes.
- What's his job?

76
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,479
My job is...
fuck and fucking.

77
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,757
- I want a beer.
- For a change!

78
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,276
We might stop there.

79
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,276
Leave it there!

80
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,792
Don't touch it!

81
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,479
- Who's there?
- It's me.

82
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,635
I've got to talk with you.

83
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,398
Your bag's heavy.

84
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,631
- This is enough for being rich.
- You might pay a coffee in Rome.

85
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,280
Did you see well? It's 50,000!

86
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,757
What did I say?
It's the price for a cappuccino.

87
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,872
But with this one you could
buy half a cow in Ethiopia.

88
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,716
- Have you been there?
- Yes.

89
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,071
- Where else have you been?
- More or less everywhere.

90
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,680
I've never been anywhere.
I don't care.

91
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:16,954
- Well actually I've been in America.
- So, how much do you have there?

92
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,112
Count them, I leave it here.
Sleep on it.

93
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,159
Perfect!

94
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,000
<i>Claire's head was spinning.</i>

95
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,400
<i>Was this a trap?
Or exactly the opportunity she was looking for?</i>

96
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,960
<i>She spent another sleepless night,
keeping her nightmares at bay.</i>

97
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,240
I don't trust people
who do thing for free.

98
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,238
- And you'd be a buddhist?
- Realist!

99
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,595
So?

100
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,871
I agree, for 30%.

101
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,236
- We counted the money, we can find you.
- Calm down Raymond.

102
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:43,360
If you want to change your mind...
Do as you want.

103
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,120
If the address is not real,
we know where to find you.

104
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,435
It's not worth to try to fool us.

105
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,560
We don't know who will fetch the money.

106
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,200
If it's not me, and if
you want to contact me,

107
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,676
have a drink, listen to some music...

108
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,638
Yes! You never know.

109
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,359
This is my music.
It's just a demo.

110
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,478
Thanks, Chico.

111
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,915
- Don't lose time.
- Don't worry.

112
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,399
Here she is!

113
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,520
<i>Claire thought about her future,</i>

114
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,440
<i>as she drove from the high plateau towards St. Étienne.</i>

115
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,120
<i>Her share of the money could buy
her an apartment on the Seine.</i>

116
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,640
<i>A quiet life, a view of the Eiffel Tower.</i>

117
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,560
<i>But did she really want all this?</i>

118
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,400
<i>Take a break, Claire.</i>

119
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,600
Where is she now ?

120
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,713
She should be between St. Étienne...

121
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,074
- and Lyon.
- still a long road.

122
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,314
- 15 more minutes?
- At least. Still has to dry up.

123
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,752
- You were lucky, and had good tyres.
- Hurry up!

124
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,200
Tell me again what time you'll go over, Günther ?

125
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,680
<i>- No.</i>
- Make sure it's after dark, ok ?

126
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,240
<i>- Ok, I'll be careful.
- Ok.</i>

127
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,080
- How is Anton?
<i>- Anton? He's okay.</i>

128
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,440
He's okay? My eyes, can you hold on one second?

129
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,920
<i>Sam?</i>

130
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,160
- Can I help you?
<i>- Are you still there? Where are you?</i>

131
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,240
Hold on, hold on a second, Günther.

132
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,000
Yeah, it's my eyes.

133
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,280
- I can't see anything.
- Well, it's better already.

134
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,640
- You have sad eyes.
- I'm not a sad man though.

135
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,480
Günther...

136
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,120
I'm gonna go now, okay?

137
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:35,080
See you tomorrow. Give my love to Anton
and Irina, please? Okay, bye bye.

138
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,758
Eugene speaking,

139
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,440
but I'm not here...

140
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,437
me neither.

141
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,160
<i>If you would like to leave a message
on our new answering machine, please</i>

142
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,440
<i>please feel free to do so after you hear the tone</i>

143
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,360
You idiot.

144
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,274
Didn't want to have a conversation with yourself?

145
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,880
Thanks for the help.

146
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,200
Hello Makiko. How are you?
Is Gene with you?

147
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,280
<i>No, I haven't seen him since you went away.</i>

148
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,760
You know that apartment across from you?
Did they sell it?

149
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,720
<i>It's still there.
Claire, are you okay?</i>

150
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,680
<i>Please, come back.
I'm so sorry.</i>

151
00:24:41,471 --> 00:24:42,893
Oh, Makiko.

152
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,560
- Excuse me. Where'd he go?
- Who?

153
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,480
- The bloke who was on the phone.
- The what?

154
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,400
The guy who was here just a minute ago.
You didn't see him?

155
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,400
No, I was on the phone myself.

156
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,160
No worries, mind.

157
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,800
Makiko, I've got to go.
I'll call you tomorrow.

158
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,920
Wait, I have to remove the foam.

159
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,840
- Will it hold til Paris?
- Yes, no problems.

160
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,430
But you're going to draw
people's attention with that foam.

161
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,240
- Hi. Me again.
- Hi.

162
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,400
Would you give me a lift?

163
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,800
I don't think that's a very good idea.

164
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,040
There's a guy looking for you.

165
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,000
- Yeah, I know.
- He's got a gun.

166
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,000
Could you go? He's coming. Please?

167
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,120
What's he after?

168
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,320
- He want's to kill me.
- What for?

169
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,240
I borrowed some money I can't pay back.

170
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:17,880
- From him?
- No, not from him from... some tough guys.

171
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,040
It's incredible.
I just seem to attract criminals.

172
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,520
Hey, I'm not a criminal.
Might not even be attracted to you.

173
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,680
Sure. You're just a regular guy
with a wife and a kid.

174
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,880
That's right.

175
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,920
This must be the beginning of a new trend.

176
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,680
I haven't met anyone with a straight job for weeks.

177
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:50,600
- Where have you been?
- Everywhere... and back.

178
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,880
- Are you tired?
- Me? Never.

179
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,400
Hey I could drive.
Really, it'd be a pleasure.

180
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,600
Show me your wife and kid.

181
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,440
Go on, you must have a picture.

182
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,560
Okay, you can drive.

183
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,880
He's got your eyes.

184
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,000
Sorry. You okay?

185
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,120
- It went with the windshield.
- That must've been some crash.

186
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:52,640
What the hell is going on?

187
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,040
- You've got to help me.
- I'd love to but how can I explain it?

188
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,600
- What?
- The car, the damage!

189
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,920
- That's not it!
- What is it then? The bag?

190
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:08,840
- What should I do?
- I don't know, Just talk to them. Keep them away.

191
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,683
I'll try.

192
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,720
Hey there fellas, how's it goin'?
You speak any English?

193
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,960
Yes a little.
Were you in a accident?

194
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,520
- I told them we were on our honeymoon.
- And they believed you?

195
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,120
So, who am I married to?

196
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,431
- Dope pusher or bank robber?
- Take your pick.

197
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,480
- Do you mind if I put on some music?
- No, go ahead.

198
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,600
That is beautiful.

199
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,800
Who are they?

200
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,560
- They're pygmy children.
- Pygmy?

201
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,960
Yeah, it's the truth.
They're young pygmy from Cameroon.

202
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,000
I've been listening to that for weeks.

203
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,960
I've never heard anything like it.

204
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,906
- My mother recorded that.
- In Cameroon?

205
00:29:51,026 --> 00:29:52,180
Yeah.

206
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,080
- What do you do?
- Everything, nothing.

207
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,240
If I say I'm a singer, you'll ask me
what I've done. Nothing.

208
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,760
I destroyed all the tapes.
I broke up with my boyfriend.

209
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,680
He fucked my best friend.
I went to Italy.

210
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,440
Now I'm on my way back to Paris.

211
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,920
Back to square one?

212
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,240
- Sort of.
- Good luck.

213
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,719
That's what I need.
And you, what do you do?

214
00:30:28,346 --> 00:30:29,965
I travel.

215
00:30:30,711 --> 00:30:33,099
And... I see.

216
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,600
<i>All overland access to Paris
is restricted to commercial transportation.</i>

217
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,080
<i>For private traffic, please use souterrain tunnels.</i>

218
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,880
<i>Charges will be applied to your credit card.</i>

219
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,680
Good evening.

220
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,440
- How long did I sleep?
- Um... 500 kilometers.

221
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,400
I haven't slept so long in weeks.

222
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,840
I dreamed I was pregnant.
I was stumbling around...

223
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,240
I felt very light.
What does it mean?

224
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,641
I don't know.
Maybe you wanna get pregnant?

225
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,640
This is as far as I go.

226
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,840
- If you're staying in Paris...
- No, I'm not.

227
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,560
I'm Claire.

228
00:32:15,043 --> 00:32:16,406
Claire Tourneur.

229
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,992
I'm Trevor McPhee.
You saved my life.

230
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,160
Good luck with your life, Trevor.

231
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,400
- I hope you learn to sleep.
- We'll see.

232
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,392
Oh, it's you, Claire!

233
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,716
So you smoke now?

234
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,320
<i>Home is where you go when you run out of places.</i>

235
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,400
<i>So Claire came back to the apartment
that she'd shared with me.</i>

236
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,320
<i>Whether she had returned
for an hour or a day, it didn't matter to me.</i>

237
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,360
<i>I just thanked God she was back, safe and sound.</i>

238
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,760
- It's you.
- I crashed the Rover.

239
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,127
Are you alright? Did you hurt yourself?

240
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,440
No, I'm fine.

241
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,520
- I'm sorry.
- No, Claire. I'm sorry.

242
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,520
- I haven't seen her since then.
- Oh, I know, Gene. I know.

243
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,824
Actually...

244
00:34:46,385 --> 00:34:48,366
I haven't seen anybody since you left.

245
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,120
I was just worried about you.

246
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,720
It looks... different.

247
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,800
I tried to paint you out.
It didn't work.

248
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,360
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

249
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,320
I never loved anyone like I love you.

250
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,760
- Do you believe that?
- Yes... I do.

251
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,800
Where did you go?

252
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,920
I went to Venice.

253
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,680
I stayed with Luca.

254
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,320
I went to a lot of parties.

255
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,720
I cried a lot.

256
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,320
I forgot how nice you smelled.

257
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,600
You seem so different.

258
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,440
I'm rich, now.

259
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:32,851
Christ.

260
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,120
Did you read about the bank robbery at Nice?

261
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,400
The guys who did it crashed into your car.

262
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,680
I had to drive them to the next town.

263
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,640
Then they told me they'd robbed a bank and...

264
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,640
asked me to take the money up to Paris.

265
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,640
Call the police.

266
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,360
No, I don't want to.

267
00:36:59,237 --> 00:37:00,553
Gene.

268
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,360
30% of this is mine.

269
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,560
Come on, Claire.
They robbed a bank.

270
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,920
They're not going to have any problems
about robbing it back from you.

271
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,360
They're not like you think.
Actually, they're nice guys.

272
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:22,440
No, really.
One of them is a very good drummer.

273
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,722
But they were desperate.

274
00:37:27,682 --> 00:37:29,518
So I thought, "why not?"

275
00:37:29,638 --> 00:37:32,840
I could buy that apartment opposite Makiko.

276
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,800
Why do you need to buy an apartment?

277
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,320
I just want my own place, that's all.

278
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,920
It's all different currencies.

279
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,280
I thought you'd help me work out
what it's worth so I know how much is mine.

280
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,280
And I might give you a cut.

281
00:38:12,656 --> 00:38:16,000
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

282
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,007
My hitchhiker robbed me.

283
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,558
Your hitchhiker!

284
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,600
Well, he left an IOU.

285
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,480
But he was a really nice guy...

286
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,000
You seem to know a lot of really nice guys.

287
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,680
- I trusted him.
- Sure, and then he robbed you.

288
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,400
Come on, you can't be upset about
having stolen money stolen.

289
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,200
<i>Hi Claire. Hi Gene.</i>

290
00:39:02,987 --> 00:39:04,548
<i>Um, so Claire...</i>

291
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:10,688
<i>I have arranged with a real estate agent
to see the apartment tomorrow afternoon.</i>

292
00:39:11,107 --> 00:39:14,195
<i>Please meet me there at 2pm.</i>

293
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:20,800
<i>It's raining a lot now.
I hope you're not outside.</i>

294
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,840
...7 at 0.552...

295
00:39:30,314 --> 00:39:34,648
is... just a minute, I'll just
put this with the subtotal here.

296
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,280
I love loving you.

297
00:39:51,287 --> 00:39:53,501
That's a good song title.

298
00:39:55,353 --> 00:39:57,800
Ah, it's too corny.

299
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,512
Depends.

300
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,440
Who is this?

301
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,320
Pygmys.

302
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,000
Pygmys.

303
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,680
This is really stupid.

304
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,520
You couldn't sell it so you put the price up.

305
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,360
But it is very reasonable in this location.
I can show you other properties.

306
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,331
This is the only one I want.

307
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,360
- I like your view.
- Oh, I like it, too.

308
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:25,640
It wasn't meant to happen.
You were singing, so we went to the movies.

309
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,640
I'm not angry with you, Makiko.
Come on, you're my friend.

310
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,520
But I have done something terrible.
I must make it right.

311
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,640
Don't be stupid. This is 1999.

312
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,720
I can get the apartment.

313
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,120
She will never find anyone
to buy it at that price.

314
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,520
I'll get her to knock it down.

315
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,080
"You can't get angry
about having stolen money stolen."

316
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,160
- What?
- Nothing.

317
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,000
I'll get the painter to put pressure on her, too.

318
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,120
I can go to my bank manager.
We have a special relationship.

319
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,960
He's going crazy because no one
is borrowing money, anymore.

320
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,320
The interest rates are too high.

321
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,000
He would give you a special rate, 19%.
Claire, where are you going?

322
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,360
Was it something I said?

323
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,720
Okay, just watch the house
until I get to Berlin.

324
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:48,800
M-A-N-G-E-R strasse 26.

325
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,400
Mangerstrasse, ok ?

326
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,200
And then follow him.
No, it's none of your business.

327
00:43:09,064 --> 00:43:10,930
<i>Redialing. Hold on.</i>

328
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,560
<i>Hi there! Winter's the name,
missing people's the game.</i>

329
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,760
<i>- Can I find someone for you?</i>
- No. Maybe. I don't know.

330
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:31,000
<i>- It's much less expensive than you'd think.</i>
- I'll think about it.

331
00:43:44,712 --> 00:43:46,401
I'm going to Berlin.

332
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,280
- Tonight?
- A friend is in trouble.

333
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,312
You don't have any friends in Berlin.

334
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,120
Well, friends can travel.

335
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,800
- I'll go with you.
- No, Gene. You can't.

336
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:19,440
<i>I was worried right away.
I knew Claire's self-destructiveness.</i>

337
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,720
<i>I knew if there was danger,
she would throw herself right into it.</i>

338
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,160
<i>If there was a chance to get hurt,
she would grab it.</i>

339
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,640
<i>What was she letting herself in for?</i>

340
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:54,160
<i>Claire never doubted she would find
the man named Trevor in Berlin.</i>

341
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,956
<i>Any sane person, like myself, would have told her she
was chasing a projection of her own imagination.</i>

342
00:45:00,076 --> 00:45:04,000
<i>But Claire never listened much
to that sort of reasonable thinking.</i>

343
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:10,440
<i>She was impulsive and stubborn,
and she was in love with the idea of being in love.</i>

344
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,120
<i>So the only think she worried about was
not if she could find Trevor McPhee,</i>

345
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,760
<i>but only what she would do when she finally found him.</i>

346
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,840
<i>Berlin was a big city now.
10 million people lived in the area.</i>

347
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,200
<i>You couldn't even take a taxi anymore.
So, she had to pedal.</i>

348
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:34,560
All the great minds were persecuted...

349
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,760
A hundred years from now
they will have you on a postage stamp.

350
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,240
So this day is a great day in history,

351
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:52,640
and your family is very proud
to be with you on this day

352
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:58,120
and you see our faces.
I know I am talking too much.

353
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,520
- Anton, it's Edith this is for, not Henry.
- I'm coming to her.

354
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,800
Hello, dear Edith.

355
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,919
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

356
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:28,120
Thanks for the music,
but you still owe the bank.

357
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,800
I thought I deserved my share.

358
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,040
We'll sort it out later.
You're being followed.

359
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,840
- Really?
- Not me, the black guy... in the street.

360
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,480
Show me.

361
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,715
Who is she? What is she doing here?

362
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,320
- What hotel are you in?
- The Adlon.

363
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,240
Can you wait? I'll meet you there.
We'll have dinner. It's a promise.

364
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,398
Uncle Anton, I'm gonna have to...

365
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:35,800
- So, you are a friend of Sam's?
- No, of Trevor's.

366
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,696
Look at them!

367
00:49:27,149 --> 00:49:31,680
We're on the eve of destruction and all they give a damn about

368
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,152
is laughing, drinking, carousing.

369
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:41,680
Don't they realize that this satellite business
could mean the end of the world as we know it?

370
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,600
If it was the end of the world,
why shouldn't we go down laughing?

371
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,520
- I could fall in love with you right now.
- Don't!

372
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:56,760
- Then I'll love you in my dreams.
- I will remember you, too.

373
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:03,200
One day, I will no longer be alive.

374
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:07,880
And when that day comes, remember me as I am now.

375
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,920
<i>Of course, Trevor McPhee did not show up.</i>

376
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,040
<i>Claire could have come back to Paris,
but she had a mission now.</i>

377
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:35,080
<i>To find and protect Trevor.
And she did have one lead.</i>

378
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,640
That's him.

379
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,450
- He's a big one. 85,000 dollars.
- He's wanted?

380
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:05,862
There's an opal mining syndicate in Australia

381
00:51:05,982 --> 00:51:08,360
offering a very tasty finding fee for his capture.

382
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,640
- What did he do?
- Apparently he stole some opal.

383
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,040
- He stole from me, too.
- How much?

384
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:25,840
Id' rather not disclose that.
I just want to find him.

385
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,120
Normally, I would charge 4,500 to retrieve it for you

386
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:35,480
but seeing as I am going to collect
a big reward from these people here.

387
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:41,000
and... assuming you are free to assist me...

388
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,160
I will get your money back for 3,000.

389
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:48,360
Maybe you're after the man, not the money.
Doesn't matter, you'll see.

390
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,880
What I'm really worried about is...
there are hitman chasing him.

391
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,320
Then we'd better get him fast, and first.

392
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,400
Fast and first, wonderful names.

393
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,840
Tricky Trevor is flying to Lisbon, Portugal, see?

394
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,400
Want your money back?
Come, sweetie. Get your hat.

395
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,800
We are on the next flight behind him.

396
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,600
Are you playing or staying?

397
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,360
Love or money?
Either way you'll win.

398
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:40,360
You are a poet, Mr. Winter, and you know it.

399
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,200
Can I have an aspirin?
I have a splitting headache.

400
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,520
<i>She'd always imagined a detective
would be some sort of a tough guy.</i>

401
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,440
<i>A Sam Spade or a Philip Marlowe.</i>

402
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,880
<i>But the truth was, Philip Winter was a bleeding heart</i>

403
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,400
<i>whose professional speciality was locating missing children.</i>

404
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,280
So what exactly is your relationship?

405
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,780
Lovers?

406
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,800
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
I know him about as well as I know you.

407
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,240
I'm not disappointed.

408
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,438
On the contrary.

409
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,000
What's next?

410
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,840
I said no. No is no.

411
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,600
Look. I've got him!

412
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,800
His credit card company was offline
for 8 hours but now I got in.

413
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,520
He's at the Alhambra hotel.

414
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,000
So, what do we do?

415
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,800
Gently, gently, catchee monkey.

416
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,520
<i>Winter was inexperienced.</i>

417
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,360
<i>He thought the cat was in the bag,
the chase was over.</i>

418
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,080
<i>He felt fat and prosperous.</i>

419
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:50,040
<i>So he was happy to allow his client a private interview with his quarry.</i>

420
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,080
I'm not the one who robs banks, you are.

421
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,840
First, you stole from me,
and then you stood me up.

422
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:02,400
You just happened
to wander in here today, to find me?

423
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:06,229
- That's three countries in three days, baby!
- Don't call me "baby".

424
00:55:06,349 --> 00:55:08,800
You just happened to be getting
your car fixed in the south of France

425
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,760
you just happened to wander into my uncle's house in Berlin?

426
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,840
I was trying to save your life.

427
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,240
You just happened to be having breakfast, in Lisbon?

428
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:21,120
That's quite a coincidence.
What agency are you with?

429
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:26,560
I don't need to chase you.
There's a detective outside who was chasing you.

430
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,698
And anyway, it was no big deal finding you.

431
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,360
Every time you use your credit cards
bells start ringing.

432
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,840
What's so funny?

433
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,759
I really like you.

434
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,760
That's why I'm having so much trouble
getting it through my skull that you're an agent.

435
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,960
If I was really an agent, I wouldn't need
to hire a bounty hunter to find you.

436
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:55,000
- A bounty hunter?
- Yes,

437
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:59,440
the guys you stole the opals from
put out a reward on you.

438
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:11,680
Would this bounty hunter of yours
be willing to let us go for a little walk?

439
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,800
With money, Mr. McPhee,
all things are possible.

440
00:56:26,709 --> 00:56:27,163
How...

441
00:56:28,876 --> 00:56:29,855
how about this?

442
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,800
Would this do it?

443
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,040
Hey, wait a minute! Wait!

444
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:12,808
Shit.

445
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:43,520
- Why are people chasing you?
- Because they want to know where I'm going.

446
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:47,040
Are you escaping from the police?

447
00:57:50,068 --> 00:57:51,129
What'd you say?

448
00:57:51,362 --> 00:57:54,920
I told her, it's a way you get married in your country.

449
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,071
Where is he from?

450
00:57:58,486 --> 00:58:00,548
He's from Australia.

451
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,032
And you're... in honeymoon?

452
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:42,040
- When I say no, I mean no.
- Get out. You work for me!

453
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:47,850
You're a small fry.
Those guys in Australia will pay me 85,000.

454
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:52,000
- Plus you owe me 3,000, okay?
- Fuck you!

455
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:00,640
- I knew this would get me in trouble.
- Put it down on the chair.

456
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,280
- I hate guns.
- Put it down.

457
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,280
Now, come over here.

458
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,720
Slowly. At the foot of the bed.

459
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,680
Now, unlock me.

460
01:00:23,667 --> 01:00:26,920
Your hand. Put it through there.
Claire, help me.

461
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,800
Give me the key.

462
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:51,992
Hey.

463
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,200
Yeah, just a second.

464
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,480
Okay, where's my opal?

465
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,000
No, Claire. No.

466
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:22,119
I'm sorry.
You're making things too dangerous for me.

467
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:24,280
Trevor, wait!

468
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:27,960
Let's just pay him off.
I have money.

469
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,616
Put that back.

470
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:39,760
You'll find these downstairs
in the garbage, where they belong.

471
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:45,280
You bastard!

472
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:49,251
You just lost me 85,000 bucks.

473
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,720
This will cover my expenses.

474
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,840
Turn around.

475
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,880
<i>What Claire felt,</i>

476
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,720
<i>she knew she could never
justify or explain to anyone.</i>

477
01:03:01,959 --> 01:03:03,459
<i>What she had was like a crush.
</i>

478
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:07,360
<i>A sort of nagging pain she thought
she'd abandoned when she was 16.</i>

479
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,270
<i>She was determined to follow her mission through,</i>

480
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:15,160
<i>no matter where it lead her.
What was the alternative?</i>

481
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:19,360
<i>A return to her old self?
She hated the very idea.</i>

482
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,760
No worries, mate. I'll take it up myself.
What floor, mate?

483
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,560
The sixth floor, sir.
You can take the elevator.

484
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,207
You're still here?

485
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,898
You can't leave without me.

486
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:02,012
"You can't leave without me"!

487
01:04:03,092 --> 01:04:06,648
You hire me, you fire me.
You abuse me and confuse me.

488
01:04:06,768 --> 01:04:10,600
You cost me a year's rent.
How can I afford to take you with me?

489
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,840
I'm broke.
He thought I was working with you.

490
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:39,840
That's why he took my money!
It's all your fault.

491
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:44,760
I can't lend you the plane fare to Paris,
but I can offer you Moscow.

492
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:52,160
You'll sit in the bar at the Ukraine.
I'll catch him, and I'll take you out to dinner.

493
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:56,360
- Deal?
- Deal.

494
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:27,360
- Hi, Gene.
- Hello, Claire.

495
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:31,120
Guess what? I need money. 5,000 dollars.

496
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:35,706
- Can you wire it to the Hotel Ukraine in Moscow?
<i>- Slow down, Claire.</i>

497
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,143
I don't have much time, Gene.
My card is running out.

498
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,680
<i>Guess who's here?</i>

499
01:05:44,341 --> 01:05:45,422
Hey, Chico!

500
01:05:45,962 --> 01:05:47,811
- Hello, Claire!
<i>- How is Raymond?</i>

501
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:52,120
<i>- Claire, where are you?</i>
- I'm in the plane to Moscow.

502
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:59,400
O-L-I-V-I...

503
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,640
That isn't it, I've forgotten it. R...

504
01:06:04,308 --> 01:06:09,040
The name is Dr. Nora Oliveira.

505
01:06:09,855 --> 01:06:13,880
- I am not sharing your room!
- You expect me to pay for two rooms?

506
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,760
- I expect you to pay for mine.
- You realize...

507
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,540
There's no need to argue with strangers.

508
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:20,408
Gene!

509
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,200
There are no rooms available.

510
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:26,705
Take a look around. There's nothing left.
The convention's taken them all.

511
01:06:26,825 --> 01:06:28,640
- Gene, this is...
- Winter.

512
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,560
There's not a single room left
in all of Moscow.

513
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,440
Winter is my name.
What's your game?

514
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:35,720
What?

515
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,720
He's a detective.

516
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,840
Find yourself a couch.
That's all we offer.

517
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:44,240
Over there.
1,500 rubles a night.

518
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
1,500 rubles a night?

519
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:50,320
- Take it or leave it.
- We'll take it.

520
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,560
It's my fishing program.

521
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:05,120
It's keyed to our man's passport and credit card.

522
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:10,920
- The minute he rents a car or crosses a border...
- It's most impressive, Mr. Winter.

523
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,200
But wouldn't you say he's crossing
a lot of borders tonight?

524
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:19,640
Eastern bloc.
Nothing but talk.

525
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,259
It's a malfunction.

526
01:07:22,447 --> 01:07:24,754
They have these advanced Vietnamese chips now.

527
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,160
What are you going to do about it?

528
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,920
I have to find a local guide tomorrow.

529
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,440
Who is this Trevor McPhee character?

530
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:50,880
A tall, handsome stranger from Australia
with an American accent.

531
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,400
What has he done?

532
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,160
Better ask the client.

533
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,000
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

534
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:11,080
- Thank you for your cooperation.
- Anytime.

535
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,040
I know you don't sleep.

536
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:45,840
I still love you, but it's a different sort of love.
That's all. It's like a ladder.

537
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:50,600
- I'm like a ladder?
- Like a ladder with a broken step.

538
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,400
And every time I see you...

539
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,760
I know I lost my life when the step broke.

540
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,120
Well, I'm sorry.

541
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:02,760
And I forgive you, but I can't trust you again.

542
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:08,400
I can understand you, and see how
you're made and feel affection for you...

543
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:12,040
But as far as you're concerned, it's over.
Your hitchhiker,

544
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,720
this man who stole your money...

545
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,736
Did you have an affair with him?

546
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,280
Do you love him?

547
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:22,920
I'll get over it.

548
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,360
- So, this is the place.
- Right.

549
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,847
Your Eastern Bloc program is out of date.

550
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,640
You try and save money,
but it only costs you money.

551
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:47,600
So, I'll give you a good price on the update.

552
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,240
Trevor McPhee,
is that what you said?

553
01:09:59,416 --> 01:10:00,033
No.

554
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:05,320
This is Trevor McPhee.
You chase your man, you'll get no reward.

555
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:09,645
This guy is traveling with Trevor McPhee's ID.

556
01:10:10,414 --> 01:10:13,520
- Who is he, then?
- May I?

557
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,800
<i>I'm the Bear. The Bounty Bear.</i>

558
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:23,200
<i>I find them here, I find them there.</i>

559
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:26,080
<i>I can find them anywhere.</i>

560
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,906
<i>The Bear. Advanced bounty bank programming.</i>

561
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:32,490
Searching.

562
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:39,160
<i>I'm searching. I'm searching.</i>

563
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:47,640
<i>Give me a minute.
I am identifying.</i>

564
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,000
<i>I got him!</i>

565
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,640
<i>This is your guy.</i>

566
01:11:02,848 --> 01:11:03,768
That's him.

567
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:14,720
<i>- Finder's fee: 500,000 dollars.</i>
- Vietnamese chips.

568
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,960
Too bad you can't afford it.

569
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,480
How do we know that price
belongs to that face?

570
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,034
You'll have to trust me.

571
01:11:24,687 --> 01:11:26,737
Is that so hard?

572
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,161
What do you want to do?

573
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:34,200
I just want my money back.

574
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:40,000
How much would it cost to set me up
with one of these, hard and soft?

575
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Marry her. Slap her around.
But don't go chasing after this guy.

576
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:50,480
She's not going to fuck you.
She wants to fuck him.

577
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:53,320
I don't think you quite understand
the nature of our relationship.

578
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,640
Besides which, you're out of your depth.

579
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:00,600
You buy a computer from this ice,
and you think you're a detective?

580
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,760
When you get back from Moscow, you'll be broke.

581
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,960
They will have repossessed your car,
your electricity will have been turned off.

582
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,440
Your computers will be down, your
garbage won't be picked up.

583
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:12,840
Mr. Winter, admit it!
You'd love it, but you can't afford it.

584
01:12:18,454 --> 01:12:22,680
To be effective you need a detective
to make one of these work for you.

585
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:34,320
I'm going back to Berlin.

586
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:39,965
You'd better ask yourself what you're
going to do with the tiger.

587
01:12:41,188 --> 01:12:42,808
When you catch him.

588
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,880
Wait a minute, Mr. Winter.

589
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:53,360
I want my opal back, please.

590
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,360
Just my expenses.
Five grand.

591
01:13:18,887 --> 01:13:23,320
<i>Sometimes Claire must have thought that she had
invented that face, invented Trevor McPhee</i>

592
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:27,240
<i>and that she'd projected onto him the person
she thought she could become.</i>

593
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:30,927
<i>But when she considered this, she
panicked and just worked harder</i>

594
01:13:31,047 --> 01:13:34,480
<i>extending her stay in Moscow from
one day to two, from two to three</i>

595
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,880
<i>always finding one more hotel
and one more concierge.</i>

596
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,960
- Winning.
- Yeah. About bloody time, too.

597
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,400
I already paid for the carpet.

598
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:41,000
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

599
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,280
It's possible.

600
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:49,280
- Anyway, what are you going to do with all that money?
- Well, we could start with a drink.

601
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:01,200
<i>With Winter gone, I was now Claire's guardian angel.</i>

602
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,840
<i>No, I was fooling myself.
I just wanted her back.</i>

603
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:08,520
<i>So, I was kind to her.
Waited for her to exhaust her crush.</i>

604
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:12,800
<i>Pretended to help her find the only man
on Earth I didn't want her to find.</i>

605
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,280
<i>Unfortunately, my Bounty Bear
found him in no time.</i>

606
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:21,360
<i>But I was, at least, able to prove that
my competitor had a bad character.</i>

607
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,600
<i>His name was Sam Farber, not Trevor McPhee.</i>

608
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:28,840
<i>He was wanted for industrial espionage
by the US government.</i>

609
01:15:33,899 --> 01:15:39,080
I have seen you somewhere before.
In the south of France.

610
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:43,200
You're Sam Farber's girlfriend, aren't you?

611
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:46,360
You mean Trevor?

612
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,560
McPhee! That's him, too.

613
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:55,520
You tell him that he is in
breach of his service agreement

614
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:58,440
with the Sunset Lab, at Palo Alto.

615
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:02,280
The camera was developed in their time,

616
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,480
- with government funds.
- Are you scientists?

617
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:11,553
He robbed me, betrayed me.
He took all my money and I'm not his girlfriend!

618
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:16,680
But you're going to tell me where he is, right?

619
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:22,560
If I knew where he was, I wouldn't be
here with you. I would be with him.

620
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:25,240
I would be making love with him.

621
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,800
Why did I say that?

622
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,920
I've given you penthocine phosphate.
It's the truth drug.

623
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:38,440
That's okay.
I've given you five sleeping pills myself.

624
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,680
You bitch.

625
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:47,720
- Is he really a criminal?
- Waiter...

626
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,400
- Coffee.
- So what. I'm a criminal, too.

627
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,960
I was involved in the bank robbery at the Nice airport.

628
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:57,640
They got Raymond, but Chico, he's still okay.

629
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:03,360
What I'm really worried about is that
the cops will get Gene's address.

630
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:06,800
He is innocent, and I am really blonde!

631
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:10,440
Cut the bullshit.

632
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:15,058
Don't go to sleep.
I want to know what Trevor did.

633
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:19,800
I told you already...

634
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,960
They never work that well for me...

635
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:39,440
I think he's a spy.
I didn't think they had spies, anymore.

636
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:42,520
I mean, we are here in Moscow, in 1999.

637
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,640
Actually, I'm not a tourist. I'm a burglar.

638
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:51,640
I've stolen these things to protect
the man who has stolen my money.

639
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:57,120
I had it. These other guys who had stolen it

640
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,680
from the people who had stolen it from a bank.

641
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,480
Are you following me?

642
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:16,200
You know we can't be together again.
You know our baby can't be born now.

643
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,880
That's even sadder than we are.

644
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:26,440
It's like a river that will never run, or
a whole day that will never happen...

645
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:32,720
Why do you keep being so good.

646
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:38,200
Why are you so sweet and kind.
Are you doing it to punish me?

647
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,320
<i>Searching...</i>

648
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,920
<i>I'm searching...</i>

649
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,040
<i>Give me a minute.</i>

650
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,320
<i>I've got him!</i>

651
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:59,200
He's getting on the Trans-Siberian.

652
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:05,160
<i>Farber has booked a seat for the train to
Beijing leaving Moscow tonight at 23:10.</i>

653
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,880
The accounting is getting very complicated.

654
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,880
I'll say goodbye now.

655
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:23,640
Anyway, it would be really painful
face to face for me, too.

656
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:28,720
I still love you, broken ladder.

657
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,638
Excuse me.

658
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,239
Excuse me.

659
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:42,080
Excuse me.

660
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,520
<i>There was not another train for three days.</i>

661
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:37,000
<i>Claire, of course, couldn't wait.</i>

662
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:42,040
<i>Within 10 minutes, she was on the back of a
motorcycle traveling southeast towards Beijing.</i>

663
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:45,640
<i>If she'd gone northwest, she could've found Trevor.</i>

664
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:49,640
It's unbelievable, Mom, how Sam found
me here in Siberia, of all places.

665
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:53,600
I wish you didn't have to see me in such an ugly place,

666
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:59,240
but I'm afraid... this is what the world looks like.

667
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:04,840
I wish Sam could've found me at
home in Lisbon, with the kids.

668
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:08,480
<i>Instead, Claire recorded some of her
journey through China for me.</i>

669
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,920
<i>4 days later, she spent a fortune videofaxing</i>

670
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,600
<i>the tape to me in Paris.</i>

671
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:33,960
<i>- What's your name?
- No, you!</i>

672
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,680
<i>Charlie Yu.</i>

673
01:25:41,027 --> 01:25:47,120
- Claire. Claire. Claire Tourneur.
- Claire Tourneur. OK!

674
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:48,912
OK.

675
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:56,583
<i>So, Gene. I am learning Chinese.
I can say already "ni hao".</i>

676
01:25:56,703 --> 01:26:00,480
<i>"ni hao" means "how are you".</i>

677
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,600
<i>So, Gene. That was my home movie.</i>

678
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:08,720
<i>I'm in Beijing now,
at the Tiananmen Hotel, room 1407.</i>

679
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:14,120
<i>Please phone me as soon you get in.
I hope you're waiting for your call.</i>

680
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:19,840
<i>Hi, Claire. It's me.
I just got in. I got your message and uh...</i>

681
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:24,000
<i>- I guess you need something else from the fridge?</i>
- I don't need anything, Gene.

682
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,080
- I'm lost.
- So, you reached a dead end, is that right?

683
01:26:30,898 --> 01:26:32,096
<i>I've lost his trace.</i>

684
01:26:32,216 --> 01:26:34,920
If you're looking for him in Beijing, I'm not surprised.

685
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:39,120
- Then where should I look?
<i>God, you never give up, do you?</i>

686
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,720
<i>Why don't you come home. Forget all about it.</i>

687
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:51,000
Look at me, Gene. I'm Claire.
What do you expect?

688
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:52,440
Right...

689
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:57,181
- Do you remember the children's theater?
- He's in Tokyo?

690
01:26:57,301 --> 01:27:00,680
<i>Yeah. I'll meet you there on Tuesday evening.</i>

691
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,800
<i>World News Network brings you this update.
The protest against an American plan</i>

692
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:08,733
<i><i>to shoot down the stray nuclear
satellite escalated last night</i>

693
01:27:08,853 --> 01:27:12,320
<i><i>with the assassination of the US ambassador
to the United Nations in Berlin.</i>

694
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:15,500
<i>The last terrifying minutes of the
ambassador's life have been captured</i>

695
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:19,200
<i>on this videotape recorded by the assassin himself.</i>

696
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:24,110
<i>If the United States shoots down
the satellite, it will cause a chain reaction.</i>

697
01:27:24,230 --> 01:27:26,988
<i>The whole world could explode.</i>

698
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:32,440
<i>Let our death be a signal, a final warning.</i>

699
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:35,320
<i>Leave the satellite alone!</i>

700
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,766
<i>I'm in no hurry to be a corpse,</i>

701
01:27:37,886 --> 01:27:43,640
<i>but I will sacrifice our lives because
the fate of the entire planet</i>

702
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:48,480
<i>depends on what the Americans do. So, goodbye!</i>

703
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:53,480
<i>For World News Network, this is Nomi Morris in Berlin.</i>

704
01:28:15,952 --> 01:28:17,338
Good morning.

705
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:22,600
I thought you'd never come.
Where is he?

706
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:29,520
How about: "It's nice to see you. I like your suit."

707
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:34,920
I hate your suit, but it is nice to see you.

708
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:39,320
Remember the first time we came to Tokyo?

709
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:42,840
It was the summer of '94.

710
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:47,360
- Our first summer.
- A grand old time.

711
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:50,600
We saw the Rolling Stones' last concert.

712
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:54,560
Of course, it wasn't their last concert, was it?

713
01:29:04,215 --> 01:29:10,040
Is a gaijin called McPhee-san, or
Farber-san, staying in the hotel?

714
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:12,200
- Farber-san?
- Yes, Farber-san.

715
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:25,120
He's saying the 7th floor.
Can you write it, please?

716
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:31,840
It's for men!

717
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:01,399
- That way.
- Thank you!

718
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:12,440
- Miss! Wait!
- A foreigner?

719
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,836
There is a foreign woman.

720
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:26,680
Madam, are you sure you're not wrong?
This place is for men only!

721
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:31,555
It's no place for women here!
Only for men, forbidden to women.

722
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:37,319
Hey, beautiful!

723
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:44,996
I need help.

724
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:50,600
- Winter ! No !
- Escape, run !

725
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:57,640
Oh, are you still playing detective,
or are you just the bellboy?

726
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,480
Where is Claire?

727
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:03,440
I saw some guy chasing her,
but that's nothing new.

728
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:09,040
- Are you taking the piss again?
- Better to be pissed off than be pissed on.

729
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:12,760
Your friend Krassikova
sold us out to the highest bidder.

730
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:17,920
CIA, KGB, Yakuza, bounty hunters.
Who know's who is in on this deal.

731
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:22,920
This is where computer programming
ends and real detective work begins.

732
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:28,240
- We don't have much time.
- We? Are you implying you want to hire me?

733
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:31,560
Hire you?

734
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:33,200
Certainly not.

735
01:32:33,421 --> 01:32:34,388
Sayonara!

736
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:44,160
Do you know who I am?

737
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:55,400
- Weren't you the angel in Lisbon?
- I am the angel again.

738
01:33:56,440 --> 01:34:01,040
Would you take me out of here. Please.

739
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:24,080
Gene, I'm sorry.

740
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,240
You're safe...

741
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:39,400
- I need my bags.
- What for?

742
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,080
Claire, I don't like this.

743
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:55,960
I don't like this at all.

744
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:00,702
You know you'd be better off with me.

745
01:35:00,822 --> 01:35:02,760
You don't know him.

746
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:04,640
Do you?

747
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,360
He needs me now.

748
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,360
Then, you'll need these, too.

749
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:02,898
Thanks.

750
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:11,600
Oh, that helps.
It's cooler.

751
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:15,920
<i>They kept moving all night until they could be sure</i>

752
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:18,720
<i>that nobody was following them anymore.</i>

753
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:22,760
<i>Eventually, they found themselves in a train leaving Tokyo.</i>

754
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:24,200
<i>They didn't know the destination.</i>

755
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,760
<i>Claire had bought the ticket at the station in Shinjuku</i>

756
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,720
<i>by pointing at a symbol that she could not read.</i>

757
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:33,080
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.

758
01:36:40,848 --> 01:36:44,640
<i>All Claire knew was that
