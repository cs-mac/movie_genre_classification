ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: [On TV]

9
00:03:13,582 --> 00:03:14,849
Yes, Israel is moving ahead...

10
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:16,646
and we continue
to make every effort...

11
00:03:16,732 --> 00:03:19,841
for a diplomatic solution
to this crisis.

12
00:03:20,107 --> 00:03:22,222
Unfortunately, Dawn,
there are those who believe...

13
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:24,178
these talks should never happen.

14
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:27,507
They will remain steadfast
with this belief until Israel...

15
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:30,692
and all of its inhabitants
are eradicated forever.

16
00:03:30,991 --> 00:03:35,058

greatest threat facing mankind:

the capabilities...

of interfering anyway.

How is it that Iran's hate
for America and Israel

is as great a threat
to democracy as Hitler's Nazis

that needs handling,

I merely transport.

that I won't do,

108

could not do knowingly.

109

And I should have known
that the price was too high

say, come and see.

And I looked and beheld
a pale horse

128
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:13,566
and his name
who sat on it was Death

129

Well, I know but I thought
maybe this could help.

00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:58,644
Just...

142
00:11:59,706 --> 00:12:00,819
I can do my own research,

143
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:03,486
and I really don't need anymore
of your hocus-pocus prophecy.

144
00:12:03,613 --> 00:12:04,891
OK, Ang?
So here, take that.

Thank you.

146
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,068

like a unified Europe

149

That hasn't happened before?

150
00:12:16,338 --> 00:12:17,952
That's different, Angela.

151
00:12:18,214 --> 00:12:19,600
No, it's not.
How is it different?

But if it doesn't make sense
to the great intellect

then it just cannot be true.

00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,643
He's fine.

166
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,053
Look, we're concerned about
one of your field ops, Jack.

167
00:13:28,312 --> 00:13:30,032
Eve, as you know
we typically handle matters

168
00:13:30,228 --> 00:13:32,115
with our field operatives
internally.

169
00:13:32,374 --> 00:13:34,374
Couple of his aliases
have been flagged on national

170
00:13:34,635 --> 00:13:38,318
and international chatter
and it's not the first time.

171
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:47,633
JACK:
Dean.

172
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:50,779
We are the CIA.

173
00:13:52,761 --> 00:13:54,603
What triggered your concern?

174
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,791
There have been several
financial transactions

175
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,930
and communications that have
made my superiors uneasy.

176
00:14:01,195 --> 00:14:03,417
He's working on a mission
in the Middle East.

177
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:05,342
No, he isn't.

178
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,876
We are the FBI.

179
00:14:07,861 --> 00:14:10,084
[Laughing]

180
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:15,957
All right, let me know
what you find out.

181
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,031
You know, it wouldn't hurt you

182
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:20,438
to smile once in a while,
sweetheart.

183
00:14:29,783 --> 00:14:31,136
Hello, Eve.

184
00:14:43,388 --> 00:14:44,773
EVE:
What are you doing here?

185
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,683
Are you having me followed?

186
00:14:50,248 --> 00:14:52,090
Have you paid any attention
to the peace talks?

187
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:55,081
I love it how you seem to show
up to talk about your issues.

188
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,170
Well, there are other
pressing matters

189
00:14:57,436 --> 00:14:58,476
that require my attention.

190
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,556
This is a pressing matter
for you, Eve,

191
00:15:01,822 --> 00:15:03,632
much more than you know.

192
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:06,117
There's never been
an opportunity like this,

193
00:15:06,384 --> 00:15:09,458
an offer of peace
from Saudi Arabia,

194
00:15:09,717 --> 00:15:12,517
Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Iraq?

195
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,705
Israel should just
carve up its homeland

196
00:15:14,968 --> 00:15:16,624
and keep a few
choice cuts for herself?

197
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,202
Is that what you're recommending?

198
00:15:18,422 --> 00:15:19,959
EVE: As much as you
might not like it,

199
00:15:20,224 --> 00:15:22,293
Israel needs to reach
a peace agreement.

200
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,155
OK, the Americans,
the EU, the Russians

201
00:15:24,242 --> 00:15:26,780
have all made it clear that
if Israel walks away from this,

202
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,116
then they're on their own.

203
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:32,416
MAN 3: In the mosques,
it is said that a true Muslim

204
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:35,552
must never recognize Israel.

205
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:38,355
Jerusalem will be
the price for peace.

206
00:15:38,614 --> 00:15:40,270
Why are you in the States?

207
00:15:40,531 --> 00:15:42,571
Because there are
Biblical prophecies coming true,

208
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,359
Eve, just as they
have in the past.

209
00:15:46,623 --> 00:15:51,844
I want you to see that
your salvation is at stake,

210
00:15:52,143 --> 00:15:55,827
and that Jesus is your
only path to heaven.

211
00:15:59,153 --> 00:16:00,996
I really need to go.

212
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,180
MAN 3:
Eve.

213
00:16:21,687 --> 00:16:23,073
What do you make of it?

214
00:16:23,376 --> 00:16:25,993
[Whispering]

215
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,018
WOMAN: it's from the
Book of Revelation.

216
00:16:29,507 --> 00:16:30,861
As in, The Good Book?

217
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,761
From my count,
it's his sixth time through it.

218
00:16:36,944 --> 00:16:38,295
Impressive.

219
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:42,348
[Whispering]

220
00:16:44,532 --> 00:16:46,932
[Whispering continues] And, so,
there was a great earthquake;

221
00:16:46,956 --> 00:16:48,872
and the sun became
black as sackcloth of hair,

222
00:16:49,168 --> 00:16:50,328
and the moon became as blood;

223
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,358
And the stars of heaven
fell unto the earth,

224
00:16:52,617 --> 00:16:55,342
even as a fig tree
casteth her untimely figs,

225
00:16:55,645 --> 00:16:57,869
when she is shaken
of a mighty wind.

226
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:03,743
Water?

227
00:17:11,244 --> 00:17:13,434
All right, who do we have here?

228
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:20,447
John Doe, killing a man,
firing a gun at a federal agent,

229
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,671
several times.

230
00:17:22,932 --> 00:17:25,122
Diving out a window.

231
00:17:25,384 --> 00:17:26,693
Impressive for a ghost.

232
00:17:29,753 --> 00:17:35,934
The question is,
you just a hit man?

233
00:17:39,985 --> 00:17:42,831
I don't think so.

234
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:44,671
How do you know Rockwell?

235
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,695
He rip you off?

236
00:17:48,878 --> 00:17:51,178
Was he gonna tell me something
you didn't want me to know?

237
00:17:55,046 --> 00:17:58,776
Rockwell mentioned Seven Wonders.

238
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:01,758
You know anything
about that, mystery man?

239
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:08,086
And I saw a new heaven
and a new earth

240
00:18:08,347 --> 00:18:09,925
for the first heaven
and the first earth

241
00:18:10,185 --> 00:18:11,495
were passed away.

242
00:18:13,825 --> 00:18:15,668
There is a revolution coming.

243
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:18,512
Revolution, huh?

244
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,299
A revolution of God.

245
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,754
Oh.

246
00:18:26,895 --> 00:18:29,238
Well, I don't have
anything like that in my file.

247
00:18:35,672 --> 00:18:37,818
Actually, Mr. Tanner,

248
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:41,162
I have a few questions
for you before you leave.

249
00:18:41,456 --> 00:18:42,883
Hello, Shane.

250
00:18:43,181 --> 00:18:44,457
Hey, Eve.

251
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:51,196
This day just keeps
getting better and better.

252
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:57,451
ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: [On TV] Shalom
Aleichem, ladies and gentlemen.

253
00:18:57,706 --> 00:19:00,661
It seems after 3 days
of negotiations,

254
00:19:00,963 --> 00:19:03,504
the world cannot agree on
anything except that Israel

255
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,366
should give a part of her
land in exchange for peace.

256
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:11,815
We are very much back to where
we started many years ago.

257
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:15,883
Israel gave up land
for peace in 1948.

258
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,211
Israel gave land
for peace with Egypt

259
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:21,171
during the Reagan administration.

260
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:25,801
Israel gave Lebanon
for peace and got Hezbollah.

261
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:29,142
She gave Gaza for peace
and got the terrorist group,

262
00:19:29,404 --> 00:19:31,015
Hamas.

263
00:19:31,278 --> 00:19:35,085
Israel, the only nation created
by a direct and sovereign

264
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:39,027
act of God over 3,500 years ago

265
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:43,013
has no more land to give,
no more to give.

266
00:19:44,195 --> 00:19:49,872
[Speaking foreign language]

267
00:19:51,397 --> 00:19:54,357
WEATHERMAN: [On TV] The weather situation
is much worse across the country,

268
00:19:54,381 --> 00:19:56,616
26 deaths are being
blamed on this cold snap

269
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:59,954
and it's expected to continue
for at least another 3 days.

270
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:04,585
WOMAN: [On TV] So has there been
enough concessions for the American

271
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,038
peace talks to go forward?

272
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,347
ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: [On TV]
Yes, Israel is willing to move ahead.

273
00:20:08,605 --> 00:20:10,831
Unfortunately, Dawn,
there are those who believe

274
00:20:11,136 --> 00:20:12,870
that these talks
should never happen.

275
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:19,150
EVE: Nick Tanner, he's a spook.

276
00:20:19,412 --> 00:20:20,721
Really?

277
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,912
When'd you get into town?

278
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,632
Didn't even know you were here.

279
00:20:24,895 --> 00:20:26,295
Well, you're on
a need-to-know basis

280
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:28,587
and you didn't need to know.

281
00:20:28,882 --> 00:20:31,002
SHANE: Counter-Intel's changed
you a little bit, huh?

282
00:20:31,026 --> 00:20:33,141
Put a little fire your belly?

283
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:35,319
Good for you.

284
00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:37,392
I've always had the fire, Shane.

285
00:20:37,658 --> 00:20:40,426
I just choose to use logic
and evidence to make decisions

286
00:20:40,685 --> 00:20:42,495
about my cases.

287
00:20:42,753 --> 00:20:44,563
You know, one of us
had to make a move

288
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:46,214
and luckily I was still able to.

289
00:20:46,472 --> 00:20:48,236
SHANE: Still angry about
our little mishap?

290
00:20:49,537 --> 00:20:51,075
Our little mishap?

291
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:52,957
Are you kidding me?

292
00:20:53,255 --> 00:20:54,775
You emptied 500 people
into the streets

293
00:20:54,826 --> 00:20:57,169
in the middle
of a monsoon on a hunch.

294
00:20:57,431 --> 00:20:58,969
You made me look
like a complete rookie

295
00:20:59,232 --> 00:21:00,737
and you nearly ruined my career

296
00:21:00,996 --> 00:21:02,762
so forgive me
if I'm still a little angry.

297
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,139
I can just come back
for those later, ma'am.

298
00:21:11,956 --> 00:21:14,530
It was a good tip, Eve.

299
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:16,718
No, Shane, it was a bad tip

300
00:21:16,978 --> 00:21:18,668
but mostly just a hunch.

301
00:21:18,932 --> 00:21:20,698
And it's never your fault.

302
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,100
You know what?
Believe whatever you want.

303
00:21:23,124 --> 00:21:25,370
No one could ever tell you
anything different anyway.

304

Right? You're perfect,
especially now

305
00:21:28,013 --> 00:21:29,813
that you're sporting
a new logo on your badge.

306
00:21:29,837 --> 00:21:31,604
Oh, you have some nerve, Shane.

307
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,370
You and your Counter-Intel
friends ever hear

308
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,293
of an operation
called Seven Wonders?

309
00:21:48,863 --> 00:21:50,052
No.

310
00:21:50,357 --> 00:21:51,634
What is it?

311
00:21:52,313 --> 00:21:54,313
I'm not sure. I was about
to find out from Rockwell

312
00:21:54,574 --> 00:21:55,934
when you friend here put him down.

313
00:21:56,068 --> 00:21:58,214
You know who he's working for?

314
00:21:58,482 --> 00:22:00,477
We have our suspicions.

315
00:22:00,782 --> 00:22:03,399
You get anything out of him
before he, you know?

316
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:04,931
No.

317
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:08,220
No, just a bunch
of Biblical nonsense,

318
00:22:08,484 --> 00:22:10,861
quote from the Book of Revelation.

319
00:22:11,131 --> 00:22:12,811
Said something about
the revolution of God.

320
00:22:12,835 --> 00:22:15,844
You know anything about that?

321
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,574
Heard of it, but nothing concrete.

322
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:20,473
Do you have any other
information or leads

323
00:22:20,497 --> 00:22:23,363
to share with me before
I have a talk with him?

324
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:24,932
Maybe.

325
00:22:27,572 --> 00:22:30,187
Why don't you let him
cool off for a little while.

326
00:22:30,444 --> 00:22:31,751

327
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:13,032
DANIEL:
Those are ammo crates.

328
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,108
How long have they been there?

329
00:24:18,212 --> 00:24:19,566

330
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,964
Agent Rearden.

331
00:24:24,917 --> 00:24:27,720
You are much more beautiful
than he described.

332
00:24:30,054 --> 00:24:32,854
You must stay
for my world-famous borscht.

333
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:38,610
How are you, my friend?

334
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,451
I received a call.

335
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:43,740
Arlin Rockwell.

336
00:24:44,004 --> 00:24:45,039
SHANE:
Yeah.

337
00:24:45,346 --> 00:24:46,621
How do you know him?

338
00:24:47,683 --> 00:24:51,871
CHEF: Let us just say we have
mutual respect for one another.

339
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:53,404
How is he?

340
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:55,243
Dead.

341
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,524
Then this coffee should be vodka.

342
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,398
Why was he killed?

343
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:10,376
I cannot help you this time.

344
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:13,209
Can't or won't?

345
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,931
What's Seven Wonders?

346
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:28,312
We are capable
of greatness, Mr. Daughtry,

347
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:34,678
the music of Beethoven,
the words of Pushkin,

348
00:25:34,974 --> 00:25:38,235
the brush strokes of Rembrandt,

349
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:41,226
but not all genius
ends up in beauty.

350
00:25:44,173 --> 00:25:47,094
There is myth that Russia
has created nuclear bombs

351
00:25:47,355 --> 00:25:50,536
that a single person
can deploy and detonate.

352
00:25:51,685 --> 00:25:54,334
A Russian scientist
working with Iran

353
00:25:54,635 --> 00:25:56,905
has created truth
out of this myth.

354
00:25:57,168 --> 00:25:58,768
Are you telling me
that Rockwell smuggled

355
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:00,555
nuclear weapons
into the United States?

356
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:03,148
Seven of them.

357
00:26:05,098 --> 00:26:06,450
Seven Wonders.

358
00:26:08,431 --> 00:26:10,320
Suitcase nukes?

359
00:26:10,618 --> 00:26:12,738
CHEF: Do you know what would
happen to city or cities

360
00:26:12,762 --> 00:26:14,383
that are hit by these bombs?

361
00:26:14,642 --> 00:26:17,790
Hundreds of thousands
of people will die instantly.

362
00:26:18,089 --> 00:26:21,164
Their flesh will literally
melt off their bodies,

363
00:26:21,424 --> 00:26:24,914
but the real strategic purpose
is the ultimate chaos

364
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,795
that will result from such attack.

365
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:29,019
SHANE: The attack itself
is not the sole purpose?

366
00:26:29,043 --> 00:26:30,746
No, Mr. Daughtry.

367
00:26:31,045 --> 00:26:33,811
The sole purpose is disruption
of American government

368
00:26:34,072 --> 00:26:35,835
and financial institutions.

369
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,949
A distraction.

370
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:45,036
The America you know
will be part of history

371
00:26:45,301 --> 00:26:47,842
and unable to protect its friends.

372
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:49,371
What friends?

373
00:26:50,243 --> 00:26:51,707
Israel.

374
00:26:53,541 --> 00:26:54,901
Do you know
that two Russian fleets

375
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:58,293
are steering for exercises
in the Persian gulf?

376
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,720
Is this Russian intelligence?

377
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,026
CHEF:
They cannot exactly say.

378
00:27:01,129 --> 00:27:04,129
They are going to blockade
the Strait of Hormuz.

379
00:27:04,387 --> 00:27:06,152
But they are moving
a muscle to do it.

380
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:08,994
Why is it that America
always thinks

381
00:27:09,251 --> 00:27:11,247
that we are center of attention

382
00:27:11,514 --> 00:27:15,657
when what we're dealing with
here is a new world order?

383
00:27:18,796 --> 00:27:22,555

files that this would be nukes.

How could that
have gotten passed us?

00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:47,625
Get me up to speed now
or get out of my truck.

390
00:27:53,134 --> 00:27:56,588
Matthew Dean is a CIA operative
we've been investigating.

391
00:27:56,852 --> 00:27:58,508
Nick and Dean have been
in communication

392
00:27:58,768 --> 00:28:00,304
for the last several weeks.

393
00:28:00,569 --> 00:28:03,489
We believe that they are working
together on a major operation.

the CIA has been investigating

certain Biblical
or apocalyptic events.

EVE: I haven't been able to
wrap my head around it either

400
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,580
but apparently recent
world events have been

401
00:28:17,699 --> 00:28:21,189
fitting right into what is known
as the Ezekiel war scenario.

in the Last Days
the people of Persia,

and the people of Gog or Rosh,
which many believe to be Russia,

00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,435
You're a better person for it.

488
00:33:49,702 --> 00:33:53,461
It's just, I just can't seem
to wrap my brain around stuff

489
00:33:53,763 --> 00:33:55,803
that you simply
have no problem with.

490
00:33:56,064 --> 00:33:57,065
I don't know why...

491
00:33:57,365 --> 00:33:58,523
Just listen.

492
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,282
You simply believe.

493
00:34:01,544 --> 00:34:04,165
I just... I wish
I could do that too,

494
00:34:04,227 --> 00:34:06,451
but I just...
I don't think that I can.

495
00:34:07,828 --> 00:34:09,180
Baby.

496
00:34:11,162 --> 00:34:13,006
It's a leap of faith either way.

497
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:16,111
I know it is.

498
00:34:16,376 --> 00:34:18,599
Do you even believe
that Jesus existed?

499
00:34:18,904 --> 00:34:20,137
Yes, Ang, of course.

500
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,168
There's overwhelming evidence, OK?

501
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:24,833
Billions of people celebrate
Christmas and Easter every year.

502
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:26,132
I get that.
I know that.

503
00:34:27,105 --> 00:34:28,916
OK, then why did they crucify him?

504
00:34:29,213 --> 00:34:30,489
What were they afraid of?

505
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:34,470
I just wish you would
open your heart

506
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:36,886
and ask God
to reveal himself to you,

507
00:34:37,149 --> 00:34:39,871
'cause he would, he will.

508
00:34:40,596 --> 00:34:45,513
I just... I'm gonna need
more time, OK?

509
00:34:45,768 --> 00:34:47,078
Just give me more time.

510
00:34:49,028 --> 00:34:50,381
OK.

511
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,682
SHANE: You know what?
She'll Full it out later.

512
00:35:01,713 --> 00:35:03,098
Thanks

513
00:35:04,511 --> 00:35:05,894
Thanks

514
00:35:06,465 --> 00:35:09,571
You all right?

515
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:11,027
No, I'm not.

516
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:12,606
I'm not all right.

517
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,047
Look, it's just part of the job.

518
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,080
You have to accept it and move on.

519
00:35:19,649 --> 00:35:21,049
Well, that should be
very comforting

520
00:35:21,073 --> 00:35:22,534
to his wife and children.

521
00:35:23,174 --> 00:35:25,016
It's not your fault, Eve.

522
00:35:26,471 --> 00:35:27,776
I should have known.

523
00:35:28,078 --> 00:35:29,312
I knew he was there.

524
00:35:29,575 --> 00:35:30,880
I just had this...

525
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,613
Hunch?

526
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:36,368
Yeah.

527
00:35:36,665 --> 00:35:38,627
SHANE: He's good, Eve.
You couldn't have known.

528
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:40,648
EVE: You know, we have
seven nuclear weapons

529
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,271
floating around
within our borders,

530
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,988
a suspect that won't
give us an inch,

531
00:35:44,251 --> 00:35:46,474
and we have two people
dead on our watch.

532
00:35:46,782 --> 00:35:48,342
How are we supposed
to find these nukes?

533
00:35:48,622 --> 00:35:50,616
SHANE: Well, not by sitting here.

534
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,456
We know almost nothing
about Matthew Dean.

535
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:56,140
The files the CIA gave us
were worthless.

536
00:35:56,401 --> 00:35:57,676
We gotta get some answers.

537
00:36:39,669 --> 00:36:41,513
EVE: What if we're supposed to fail?

538
00:36:44,306 --> 00:36:46,269
What do you mean?

539
00:36:46,529 --> 00:36:48,797
EVE: What if this
really is God's plan?

540
00:36:51,665 --> 00:36:54,662
I don't think
nuclear weapons going off

541
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:58,955
killing hundreds of thousands
of people is God's plan.

542
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,977
So you do believe in God.

543
00:37:03,968 --> 00:37:06,113
Ah, I don't know.

544
00:37:07,952 --> 00:37:09,792
I guess I've always thought
there was something

545
00:37:09,816 --> 00:37:12,562
bigger than us.

546
00:37:12,858 --> 00:37:14,284
But that's about it.

547
00:37:15,811 --> 00:37:17,161
You?

548
00:37:17,726 --> 00:37:19,246
My family went through
an abrupt change

549
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,910
in our beliefs when I was 12.

550
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:25,849
And one night my father comes
in and tells me about Jesus.

551
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:33,057
You know, he told me that he
wouldn't force me to believe,

552
00:37:33,324 --> 00:37:35,896
but you know he believed
that Jesus Christ

553
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,924
died for him on the cross.

554
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,030
You never told me this before.

555
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:44,058
I never told anyone.

556
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:50,193
It just never seemed
poignant until now.

557
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,903
Anyway, when I turned 18,
I moved out of my house

558
00:37:56,163 --> 00:38:00,502
and I... I kept in contact
with my mother,

559
00:38:00,801 --> 00:38:04,945
but I rarely spoke to my father.

560
00:38:05,246 --> 00:38:07,820
It just seemed like
every time we talked

561
00:38:08,123 --> 00:38:13,649
our conversations would
lead to talks about Jesus.

562
00:38:13,908 --> 00:38:18,127
He would just keep telling me
that Jesus came down to earth

563
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,732
to die for me
on the cross so that...

564
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,766
so that I could be forgiven.

565
00:38:26,592 --> 00:38:27,977
Do you believe that?

566
00:38:32,534 --> 00:38:33,886
I don't know.

567
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:41,317
I guess I've always been more
of a believe-it-when-I-see-it

568
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:43,343
type of guy, you know?

569
00:38:45,104 --> 00:38:46,488
Me too.

570
00:39:10,013 --> 00:39:12,013
SHANE: What was he doing
in the Middle East, Jack?

571
00:39:12,621 --> 00:39:13,735
JACK:
That's classified.

572
00:39:14,001 --> 00:39:15,768
I gave you the files.

573
00:39:16,338 --> 00:39:18,758
The files were useless
and you know it.

574
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:21,442
Anything that would have shed
light on this was deleted.

575
00:39:21,703 --> 00:39:23,471
Now what's the revolution of God?

576
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:26,039
Classified.

577
00:39:30,021 --> 00:39:32,821
We have an imminent
threat on our hands.

578
00:39:33,085 --> 00:39:34,445
We're talking about
the destruction

579
00:39:34,469 --> 00:39:36,579
of the United States of America.

580
00:39:36,843 --> 00:39:41,759
Millions innocent people will die.

581
00:39:42,016 --> 00:39:44,087
And you're passing off
the classified stamp?

582
00:39:46,538 --> 00:39:47,889
What are you hiding, Jack?

583
00:39:51,136 --> 00:39:52,642
What are you hiding, Jack?!

584
00:39:52,938 --> 00:39:54,016
EVE:
Easy.

585
00:39:54,279 --> 00:39:56,045
Take your hands off me, son.

586
00:39:58,726 --> 00:40:00,078
Now.

587
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:09,457
Supposedly, the revolution of God

588
00:40:09,763 --> 00:40:12,063
is a group of high-ranking
world leaders

589
00:40:12,331 --> 00:40:15,178
with plans for a new world order.

590
00:40:15,474 --> 00:40:18,426
We have not been able
to confirm or deny

591
00:40:18,692 --> 00:40:20,455
the validity of their existence.

592
00:40:22,065 --> 00:40:24,058
We can.

593
00:40:24,326 --> 00:40:25,966
We have one of their
operatives in custody

594
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,318
so we know they exist.

595
00:40:27,621 --> 00:40:29,381
We also have reason
to believe that he's been

596
00:40:29,405 --> 00:40:30,615
in communication with Dean.

597
00:40:30,878 --> 00:40:34,031
JACK: Dean is what we call
a nontraditional operative.

598
00:40:34,291 --> 00:40:36,514
He's a covert
operations specialist.

599
00:40:36,817 --> 00:40:39,086
He's a psychological
operations expert

600
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:43,152
in chaos theory
and unconventional warfare.

601
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:47,090
His real talent
is destabilizing governments.

602
00:40:47,357 --> 00:40:49,016
And we trained this guy?

603
00:40:49,276 --> 00:40:51,969
JACK: You better start thinking
a whole lot more like Dean

604
00:40:52,226 --> 00:40:54,766
if you have any prayer
of catching him

605
00:40:55,024 --> 00:40:56,788
and finding those nukes.

606
00:40:58,931 --> 00:41:04,079
Yeah, we have our operatives
working on this, as well.

607
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:06,528
That's what I'm afraid of.

608
00:41:06,827 --> 00:41:08,101
Let's go.

609
00:41:18,975 --> 00:41:22,738
MAN 3: Eve, Agent Daughtry,
get in the car please.

610
00:41:30,587 --> 00:41:32,627
MAN 3: A couple of years
back, a CIA analyst

611
00:41:32,888 --> 00:41:34,773
began using prophecy in the Bible

612
00:41:35,072 --> 00:41:37,644
to analyze events
in the Middle East.

613
00:41:37,907 --> 00:41:39,717
There was some
interesting results.

614
00:41:39,978 --> 00:41:41,058
Like what?

615
00:41:41,318 --> 00:41:43,695
Israel recapturing
the western wall in Jerusalem

616
00:41:43,963 --> 00:41:45,270
after the Six-Day war.

617
00:41:45,533 --> 00:41:48,760
There was also a concern
about an event we'd refer to

618
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,445
as the Rapture.

619
00:41:50,747 --> 00:41:52,427
EVE: Wait, so people
in the administration

620
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:54,392
were actually concerned
about the Rapture?

621
00:41:54,694 --> 00:41:58,803
SHANE: Rapture meaning
everyone vanishes?

622
00:41:59,062 --> 00:42:00,942
Well, there are many
interpretations about this,

623
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,206
but yes.

624
00:42:02,472 --> 00:42:04,696
Losing a substantial
number of military

625
00:42:05,003 --> 00:42:07,882
and key government personnel
to an apocalyptic event

626
00:42:08,147 --> 00:42:11,373
such as this, could be
problematic at best.

627
00:42:11,636 --> 00:42:13,747
Contingency plans were needed

628
00:42:14,008 --> 00:42:17,420
so they sent Dean
into the field to investigate.

629
00:42:17,688 --> 00:42:19,168
We intercepted
a number of phone calls

630
00:42:19,413 --> 00:42:21,180
that may be of interest to you.

631
00:42:23,514 --> 00:42:25,194
SHANE: Our sources claim
that Russia's Navy

632
00:42:25,218 --> 00:42:26,578
is headed to the Strait of Hormuz.

633
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:27,812
Is that true?

634
00:42:28,075 --> 00:42:29,188
We believe so.

635
00:42:29,455 --> 00:42:33,637
So Russia and Iran are involved
in the revolution of God?

636
00:42:33,937 --> 00:42:35,781
We believe that Rockwell
brought the bombs

637
00:42:36,046 --> 00:42:37,812
in through the Great Lakes.

638
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:41,182
Simply put, their primary goal

639
00:42:41,489 --> 00:42:44,562
is to wipe Israel
off the face of the earth.

640
00:42:44,822 --> 00:42:46,247
Taking America out of the equation

641
00:42:46,506 --> 00:42:48,885
is their first order of business.

642
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:50,962
And Dean is working for him?

643
00:42:51,222 --> 00:42:52,378
We now believe that Dean

644
00:42:52,677 --> 00:42:54,793
is their number-one
field lieutenant.

645
00:42:55,055 --> 00:42:57,475
Essentially, their
boots-on-the-ground commander.

646
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,345
Plan the CIA.

647
00:43:04,289 --> 00:43:07,396
We're talking about the end, Eve.

648
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:13,113
Agent Daughtry, my daughter's life

649
00:43:13,373 --> 00:43:17,015
is in your hands
and so is Israel's.

650
00:43:17,284 --> 00:43:21,119
The two of you have been chosen.

651
00:43:21,381 --> 00:43:22,887
Put aside your differences.

652
00:43:23,144 --> 00:43:24,988
Forget the past.

653
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:27,713
There's no longer
any need for that.

654
00:43:27,976 --> 00:43:29,011
We have to succeed.

655
00:43:29,278 --> 00:43:32,961
We have to find those bombs
and we have to find them now.

656
00:43:46,448 --> 00:43:48,292
[Knocking]

657
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:57,102
Yes?

658
00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:02,091
Hi, I was wondering
if you've seen my dog around?

659
00:44:02,351 --> 00:44:03,736
No, I haven't.

660
00:44:03,999 --> 00:44:07,030
He's just this little
Jack Russell,

661
00:44:07,334 --> 00:44:08,609
a little black and white thing.

662
00:44:09,863 --> 00:44:11,628
You want to take a look out back?

663
00:44:11,892 --> 00:44:13,660
Yeah, that'd be
great if you don't mind.

664
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,423
No, no, please.

665
00:44:16,723 --> 00:44:17,998
Yeah, oh, sure.

666
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:37,693
Excuse me, ma'am?

667
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,060
Sorry, we're closed
for the evening.

668
00:44:41,555 --> 00:44:43,400
We're with the FBI.

669
00:44:43,665 --> 00:44:45,625
We were hoping you could
hold the door open for us

670
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:46,924
for just a few minutes.

671
00:44:47,498 --> 00:44:48,883
FBI, huh?

672
00:44:50,141 --> 00:44:51,527
Just a few minutes.

673
00:44:52,136 --> 00:44:57,889
Zeus, come here, boy.

674
00:44:58,150 --> 00:44:59,426
Zeus?

675
00:45:05,471 --> 00:45:07,791
DANIEL: Probably just out in
the street playing somewhere.

676
00:45:11,796 --> 00:45:13,179
Thanks for your help, though.

677
00:45:15,167 --> 00:45:16,519
I'll see you later.

678
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:19,924
Have a good evening, Daniel.

679
00:45:27,273 --> 00:45:28,593
Well, at least the public library

680
00:45:28,617 --> 00:45:30,309
still carries a Bible.

681
00:45:30,611 --> 00:45:31,799
Nice.

682
00:45:32,068 --> 00:45:34,793
OK, Ezekiel's war scenario.

683
00:45:40,116 --> 00:45:44,076
You never mentioned your father
was a high-level agent.

684
00:45:44,334 --> 00:45:45,639
You never asked.

685
00:45:47,895 --> 00:45:51,733
Anyway, he considers himself
my guardian angel.

686
00:45:51,997 --> 00:45:54,461
Plus if people knew,
including you,

687
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:56,158
I'd have been given
special treatment

688
00:45:56,213 --> 00:45:57,490
and I didn't want it.

689
00:46:02,957 --> 00:46:04,342
You knew.

690
00:46:06,483 --> 00:46:08,123
You had your reasons
for keeping it quiet.

691
00:46:08,247 --> 00:46:09,522
I can respect that.

692
00:46:14,072 --> 00:46:15,916
I'm sorry for everything.

693
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,635
Yeah, me too.

694
00:46:20,855 --> 00:46:22,697
I shouldn't have
left you like that.

695
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:25,846
You had every right to leave me.

696
00:46:26,106 --> 00:46:28,829
I shouldn't have put you in that
situation in the first place.

697
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:33,353
I'm sorry.

698
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,614
So does your father really
believe this End-Times scenario?

699
00:46:46,877 --> 00:46:48,873
He's been preaching it
for a long time now.

700
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:52,015
He and his people have been
paying close attention to it.

701
00:46:52,282 --> 00:46:53,284
You believe it?

702
00:46:53,505 --> 00:46:54,945
I believe we need
to find these nukes

703
00:46:54,969 --> 00:46:56,849
or we're all gonna find out
the truth real soon.

704
00:47:00,061 --> 00:47:01,904
Sorry, I didn't tell you
about my father.

705
00:47:18,992 --> 00:47:20,529
You looking to buy a used Harley?

706
00:47:20,795 --> 00:47:22,559
Only if it's
American-made.

707
00:47:28,842 --> 00:47:30,194
Cash first.

708
00:47:39,342 --> 00:47:42,145
Aren't you a little old
to be buying a fake ID?

709
00:47:44,517 --> 00:47:47,361
EVE: OK, the audio
files were encrypted

710
00:47:47,622 --> 00:47:48,897
Masad cleaned them.

711
00:47:50,149 --> 00:47:51,535
MAN: [Recorded voice]
This is the fallen one.

712
00:47:51,799 --> 00:47:53,947
MAN: [Distorted voice] Hello, my son.
Is there much to report?

713
00:47:54,214 --> 00:47:55,368
MAN: [Recorded voice]
The stork is delivered.

714
00:47:55,667 --> 00:47:56,975
Seven Wonders is in good hands.

715
00:47:57,239 --> 00:47:58,599
We're waiting
the Decalogue from...

716
00:47:58,774 --> 00:48:00,048
Wait, wait.

717
00:48:02,758 --> 00:48:05,103
Just play it again
from the beginning.

718
00:48:05,824 --> 00:48:07,253
MAN: [Recorded voice]
This is the fallen one.

719
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:08,290
MAN: [Distorted voice]

720
00:48:08,314 --> 00:48:09,834
Hello, my son.
Is there much to report?

721
00:48:09,966 --> 00:48:11,118
MAN: [Recorded voice]
The stork is delivered.

722
00:48:11,383 --> 00:48:12,885
Seven Wonders is in good hands.

723
00:48:13,144 --> 00:48:15,291
We're awaiting
the Decalogue from Mother.

724
00:48:15,557 --> 00:48:18,117
MAN: [Recorded distorted voice]
Decalogue will be delivered soon.

725
00:48:18,141 --> 00:48:20,364
Seven Wonders
will proceed as planned.

726
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,814
Stork?

727
00:48:23,072 --> 00:48:24,074
Who's Stork?

728
00:48:24,336 --> 00:48:25,339
Could that have...

729
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:26,911
could that have been Rockwell?

730
00:48:27,169 --> 00:48:28,751
That would make sense
if he was the one

731
00:48:29,011 --> 00:48:31,279
who smuggled the bombs
into the United States.

732
00:48:31,539 --> 00:48:32,999
In good hands?

733
00:48:33,304 --> 00:48:35,113
Stork delivered?

734
00:48:35,373 --> 00:48:37,641
In good hands?

735
00:48:37,942 --> 00:48:39,217
EVE:
What?

736
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:43,622
They're all in the same place,

737
00:48:43,878 --> 00:48:45,721
the nukes.

738
00:48:45,986 --> 00:48:48,410
They haven't gone anywhere yet.

739
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:50,939
This conversation was recorded
a couple days ago.

740
00:48:53,846 --> 00:48:55,166
The bombs are still all together.

741
00:48:55,226 --> 00:48:56,991
They were transported together.

742
00:48:58,483 --> 00:49:00,782
We may still have a chance
at intercepting them all.

743
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,463
What's Decalogue?

744
00:49:05,035 --> 00:49:08,186
LIBRARIAN: Decalogue,
the Ten Commandments,

745
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:11,140
the code by which
we are all to live.

746
00:49:11,438 --> 00:49:13,660
You kids never read
the Bible anymore, do you?

747
00:49:21,554 --> 00:49:24,355
Look it up, D for Decalogue.

748
00:49:29,449 --> 00:49:32,673
All right, D.

749
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:34,587
She was right,
the Ten Commandments

750
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:38,269
or precepts given by God
to Moses at Mount Sinai

751
00:49:38,569 --> 00:49:41,415
and originally written
on two tablets of stone.

752
00:49:41,674 --> 00:49:46,043
SHANE: The code by which we
are all supposed to live.

753
00:49:46,312 --> 00:49:47,468
The code.

754
00:49:47,731 --> 00:49:49,494
Codes

755
00:49:49,799 --> 00:49:51,226
They're waiting on the army codes.

756
00:49:51,482 --> 00:49:53,098
From Mother.

757
00:49:53,362 --> 00:49:55,861
They're waiting on Mother,
Mother Russia.

758
00:49:56,122 --> 00:49:57,889
The codes are coming from Russia.

759
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:01,954
So this new loose end
must have been Rockwell.

760
00:50:02,216 --> 00:50:03,981
Then he wasn't the stork.

761
00:50:04,974 --> 00:50:06,053
I don't think so.

762
00:50:06,317 --> 00:50:07,820
I mean the stork carries newborns.

763
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,400
Your father said that he thought
Rockwell carried the bombs

764
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,645
down through the Great Lakes.

765
00:50:11,912 --> 00:50:14,483
So the stork must be a ship.

766
00:50:14,748 --> 00:50:17,440
Are there any Russian
or eastern European names

767
00:50:17,698 --> 00:50:19,008
on these lists?

768
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:21,185
I don't know,
there's 500 ships on this list.

769
00:50:21,453 --> 00:50:23,373
What country of origin
do you think it came from?

770
00:50:23,397 --> 00:50:25,407
Russia, Germany?

771
00:50:25,671 --> 00:50:26,902
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Germany.

772
00:50:27,164 --> 00:50:28,930
A ship named Storch.

773
00:50:30,078 --> 00:50:31,538
Chicago.

774
00:50:31,802 --> 00:50:33,568
The bombs are in Chicago.

775
00:50:35,521 --> 00:50:36,961
MATTHEW DEAN:
This is fallen leader.

776
00:50:36,985 --> 00:50:38,225
Our timeline has been moved up.

777
00:50:38,509 --> 00:50:40,731
Prepare for immediate deployment.

778
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,237
We're out of time, Nick.

779
00:50:53,223 --> 00:50:56,025
You know what narcosynthesis is?

780
00:50:56,328 --> 00:50:57,484
You should,

781
00:50:57,747 --> 00:50:59,589
your friends came up with it

782
00:50:59,855 --> 00:51:01,622
except they called it SB17.

783
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:06,724
That's gonna hurt.

784
00:51:06,983 --> 00:51:09,023
Just relax.

785
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:11,936
Let it work.

786
00:51:12,232 --> 00:51:14,382
The sting you feel
is a thiopental part

787
00:51:14,648 --> 00:51:16,230
of a new and improved concoction.

788
00:51:16,488 --> 00:51:20,706
Not like the truth serum
your old man used to use.

789
00:51:20,971 --> 00:51:22,246
Is it working, Nick?

790
00:51:23,922 --> 00:51:26,724
This makes lying more complex
than telling the truth.

791
00:51:29,595 --> 00:51:32,821
It will help ensure
things go smoother,

792
00:51:33,082 --> 00:51:34,357
quicker.

793
00:51:37,413 --> 00:51:39,757
Where are the bombs, Nick?

794
00:51:40,019 --> 00:51:41,327
Where are they?

795
00:51:43,313 --> 00:51:48,110
It's too late for you
and your little girlfriend.

796
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:50,564
Bombs...

797
00:51:50,825 --> 00:51:55,471
I had hoped that you
were smarter than most.

798
00:51:55,731 --> 00:51:58,422
Yes, we're organized.

799
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,942
I know who you are, Shane.

800
00:52:02,208 --> 00:52:03,243
Where are they?

801
00:52:03,511 --> 00:52:06,771
NICK: You shouldn't be so
concerned with the suitcases.

802
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:10,875
America's been caught sleeping,
blinded by selfishness.

803
00:52:11,177 --> 00:52:12,942
Where are the bombs?!

804
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:18,037
Blood will flow, starting with
your little Israeli friends,

805
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,070
we should cut off their head.

806
00:52:21,677 --> 00:52:23,182
What Israeli friends?!

807
00:52:23,479 --> 00:52:24,983
Cut off what head?!

808
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,588
I am but one, but we are many.

809
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,312
There are millions of us.

810
00:52:28,574 --> 00:52:30,841
We're a tide that will not
