1
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,632
Turn around.

2
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:36,277
Turn around.

3
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:40,347
Turn the car around
and get the hell out of here.

4
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,163
Right now.

5
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,624
Don't go back.

6
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:09,309
Do not go back there.

7
00:01:42,175 --> 00:01:45,274
Hey! Hey!

8
00:02:16,543 --> 00:02:18,453
What the hell's going on here?

9
00:04:39,263 --> 00:04:41,303
You stole my story.

10
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:44,254
Well?

11
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,619
I'm sorry. Do l--?

12
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:49,240
-I don't know you.
-I know that.

13
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:52,571
That doesn't matter. I know you,
Mr. Rainey, that's what matters.

14
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:54,077
You stole my story.

15
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:56,888
You're mistaken.
I don't read manuscripts.

16
00:04:57,055 --> 00:05:00,251
You read this one already.
You stole it.

17
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:01,818
I can assure you that l--

18
00:05:01,983 --> 00:05:04,350
I know you can. I know that.
I don't want to be assured.

19
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:09,182
If you want to talk to someone about
some grievance you feel you have...

20
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:14,394
-...call my literary agent in New York.
-This is between you and me.

21
00:05:16,575 --> 00:05:21,627
We don't need outsiders, Mr. Rainey.
It is strictly between you and me.

22
00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:25,045
All right, look, mister,
whoever you are...

23
00:05:25,215 --> 00:05:27,670
...I don't like being accused
of plagiarism...

24
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,709
...if that's what you're accusing me of.
Chico, inside.

25
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,011
I don't blame you for not liking it,
but you did it.

26
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:35,419
You stole my story.

27
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,820
-Leave. I have nothing more to say.
-Yeah, I'll go.

28
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,312
We'll talk more later.

29
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,908
I'm not taking that.

30
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,592
Won't do you any good to
play games with me, Mr. Rainey.

31
00:05:46,335 --> 00:05:47,764
This has got to be settled.

32
00:05:47,935 --> 00:05:49,844
So far as I'm concerned, it is.

33
00:07:06,335 --> 00:07:07,764
"Sowing Season.

34
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,557
John Shooter."

35
00:07:16,192 --> 00:07:18,014
Never heard of you, pal.

36
00:07:20,895 --> 00:07:22,139
Never heard of your story.

37
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,311
Now...

38
00:07:42,751 --> 00:07:44,475
...where was l?

39
00:08:13,343 --> 00:08:15,448
I'm open to suggestions.

40
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:27,038
If you don't go and bite her,
I'll kill her.

41
00:08:33,343 --> 00:08:35,896
"Four days after George had
confirmed to his satisfaction...

42
00:08:36,063 --> 00:08:38,038
...that his wife was cheating on him,
he confront--"

43
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:39,734
This is just bad writing.

44
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:46,744
Just bad writing.

45
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:48,665
So you know what to do.

46
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,493
Just do it.

47
00:08:55,103 --> 00:08:57,591
No bad writing.

48
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,032
I think that solves it.

49
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,333
Oh, I found one of your stories
in the trash, Mr. Rainey.

50
00:09:30,495 --> 00:09:33,309
I thought you might want it,
so I put it on the table.

51
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:36,221
Yeah, I see that, Mrs. Garvey.

52
00:09:50,815 --> 00:09:53,532
"Todd Downey thought that a woman
who would steal your love...

53
00:09:53,695 --> 00:09:57,372
...when your love was really all you
had, was not much of a woman.

54
00:09:57,535 --> 00:09:59,607
He, therefore, decided to kill her.

55
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,972
He would bury her in
the deep corner formed...

56
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,307
... where the house and the barn
came together at an extreme angle.

57
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:07,860
He would bury her where
his wife kept her garden.

58
00:10:08,031 --> 00:10:10,104
The garden she loved
more than she loved him. "

59
00:10:10,271 --> 00:10:11,896
Oh, shit. Oh, sh--

60
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:16,532
Thank God. From the sound of you,
I didn't know what to think.

61
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,459
Let me get this. That's my job.

62
00:10:18,623 --> 00:10:20,728
I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Garvey.
I really am.

63
00:10:20,895 --> 00:10:23,099
I'll take care of this.
Go on back to work.

64
00:10:23,263 --> 00:10:25,303
-I didn't write this.
-Oh, I thought you did.

65
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:29,944
No, it's not mine. Look, it says John
Shooter right there. It's not me.

66
00:10:30,111 --> 00:10:32,533
Oh, I thought it was one of those...

67
00:10:32,703 --> 00:10:34,612
...whatchamacallums,
pseudo-names or "-nyms."

68
00:10:34,783 --> 00:10:37,434
No. No, I never used one.
I've never used one.

69
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:41,854
Oh, I can't imagine why you would.
I mean, hide behind a made-up name.

70
00:10:42,015 --> 00:10:46,903
No. Mrs. Garvey, what I'm trying to tell
you is that someone else wrote this.

71
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:49,046
Oh. Okey dokey, then.

72
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,221
"A woman who'd steal your love
when your love was all you had...

73
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,917
...wasn't much of a woman.

74
00:11:17,087 --> 00:11:19,356
That, at least,
was Tommy Haverlock's opinion.

75
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,948
He decided to kill her.

76
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:23,868
He even knew the place he would
bury her. The exact place.

77
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,518
The little patch of garden
she kept in the extreme angle...

78
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:29,720
...formed where the old and new parts
of the house came together.

79
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:33,050
He'd bury her in the garden she loved
more than she loved him. "

80
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:36,502
Come to the flea market with me.
It'll be fun.

81
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:40,307
We've got to get rid of some of
this stuff. Look at this, it's awful.

82
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:42,809
No wonder they left it.

83
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,387
Oh, my God, look, there's a window.

84
00:11:48,831 --> 00:11:51,003
It's a secret window.

85
00:11:52,574 --> 00:11:54,397
Oh, this is perfect.

86
00:11:54,719 --> 00:11:56,213
I'm gonna put my garden
right there.

87
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:00,890
It's a secret window, and it'll look down
on a secret garden.

88
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,181
Shit.

89
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,001
I didn't steal it.

90
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:10,585
What?

91
00:13:12,991 --> 00:13:14,933
Mr. Rainey?

92
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,795
I'm all done.

93
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,300
Really? So soon? Well...

94
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:22,877
-...I'll see you next time.
-Mr. Rainey...

95
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,533
...there's something I want to say.

96
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:28,179
Some women don't know
a good thing when they got it.

97
00:13:29,086 --> 00:13:33,015
They don't know they got the whole
world right in front of their nose.

98
00:13:33,182 --> 00:13:34,906
There. That's it.

99
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,141
Not another word from me.

100
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:43,608
Mr. Rainey?

101
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,133
Can I make you something to eat?

102
00:13:46,303 --> 00:13:48,725
No. I ate. Well, earlier.

103
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:52,124
I'm going to eat later.
And I'll make it myself.

104
00:13:52,287 --> 00:13:54,490
You're a good man, Mr. Rainey.

105
00:13:54,654 --> 00:13:55,898
You too, Mrs. Garvey.

106
00:14:05,183 --> 00:14:09,209
It's my personal business,
Mrs. Garvey. Thank you very much.

107
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,579
My pillows now.

108
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:14,873
Her sticky, weird fingers
on my privacy.

109
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:20,025
I didn't steal that story.

110
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:29,626
I don't think.

111
00:15:15,103 --> 00:15:17,469
-Hello?
-Hello, Mort.

112
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,021
-Are you all right?
-Yeah. I'm all right.

113
00:15:21,183 --> 00:15:23,419
-Why wouldn't I be all right?
-I don't know.

114
00:15:23,807 --> 00:15:26,676
You're up there alone. Anything could
happen and nobody would know.

115
00:15:26,847 --> 00:15:28,986
-I'd know.
-Right.

116
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:32,893
How's my little baby puppy? Did
Chico get those cataracts removed?

117
00:15:33,055 --> 00:15:35,095
Why did you call, Amy?
What do you want?

118
00:15:35,263 --> 00:15:37,150
I had one of those feelings I get.

119
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,897
I know you think they're stupid
and you don't believe them...

120
00:15:40,063 --> 00:15:41,240
...but I believe them.

121
00:15:41,406 --> 00:15:45,749
I was making a sandwich and I had a
sensation that you might not be okay.

122
00:15:45,918 --> 00:15:48,090
I held off as long as possible.

123
00:15:48,255 --> 00:15:51,189
But then I couldn't anymore,
so here I am.

124
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:54,141
Well, I don't know what to tell you
except I'm fine.

125
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,346
Nothing weird happened or anything?

126
00:16:00,062 --> 00:16:01,885
Do you remember "Secret Window"?

127
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,224
What?

128
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:07,733
My story. You know, the one where
the woman has the garden...

129
00:16:07,902 --> 00:16:09,975
...and then the guy has the shovel.

130
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:12,510
-Not one of my favorites.
-That's good to know.

131
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,580
Well, it was kind of hostile,
don't you think?

132
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:17,468
Gee, I miss your constructive criticism.
I really do.

133
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:18,875
What about the story, Mort?

134
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:21,406
I was just wondering,
do you think it's possible...

135
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:25,975
...that I might have been influenced
by anybody or anything at that time?

136
00:16:26,207 --> 00:16:27,636
Other than Jack Daniel's?

137
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,775
I know that part, Amy,
hence the question.

138
00:16:30,942 --> 00:16:32,120
I don't know.

139
00:16:32,286 --> 00:16:35,320
You got weird on that one.
You'd write it mostly at night, I think.

140
00:16:36,223 --> 00:16:38,940
-What do you mean, "influenced"?
-I don't know.

141
00:16:39,103 --> 00:16:40,477
Like, by another story?

142
00:16:40,638 --> 00:16:42,777
Look, forget it.

143
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:46,652
Mort, you swore the one time
was the only time.

144
00:16:46,815 --> 00:16:49,149
Forget it, please.
Please, just forget it. Come on.

145
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:51,288
How's T ed?

146
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:53,685
He's fine.

147
00:16:54,303 --> 00:16:57,564
I was thinking that he and I should get
together sometime, have a drink...

148
00:16:57,758 --> 00:17:00,027
...because we've been to a lot
of the same places.

149
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,457
-You know what? I gotta go.
-So do l.

150
00:17:04,286 --> 00:17:05,715
Okay.

151
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:07,609
-ls he there?
-No.

152
00:17:07,774 --> 00:17:08,985
We're not together.

153
00:17:10,815 --> 00:17:12,637
Wow, well...

154
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:16,882
...I'd be lying if I said I wasn't on
the verge of doing Snoopy dances.

155
00:17:17,054 --> 00:17:18,810
No, Mort.

156
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,772
What I meant was we're
not together at the moment.

157
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:27,699
He's coming over later. He hardly ever
comes here. I usually go to his house.

158
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:30,870
There's a useful detail.
Thanks for that.

159
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,340
Don't ask, then.
It was working just fine that way.

160
00:17:33,503 --> 00:17:35,674
I think you should have him
over to the house more.

161
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,134
Such a nice house. I like it.
I mean, I love it. That's why I bought it.

162
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:40,889
Goodbye, Mort.

163
00:17:41,918 --> 00:17:43,609
Goodbye, Amy.

164
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:53,114
Shit. Shit. Shit.
Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.

165
00:18:10,878 --> 00:18:13,529
-You read it?
-I did.

166
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:16,509
I imagine it rang a bell, didn't it?

167
00:18:16,671 --> 00:18:18,646
Oh, it certainly did.

168
00:18:19,135 --> 00:18:20,564
When did you write it?

169
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:22,622
I thought you'd ask that.

170
00:18:22,783 --> 00:18:23,993
That's the whole point.

171
00:18:24,158 --> 00:18:27,453
Two writers have the same story,
it's all about who wrote the words first.

172
00:18:27,614 --> 00:18:29,753
-Wouldn't you say that's true?
-I suppose so.

173
00:18:29,918 --> 00:18:33,180
I suppose that's why I came
all the way up here from Mississippi.

174
00:18:41,758 --> 00:18:45,501
I wrote it seven years ago, 1 997.

175
00:18:45,823 --> 00:18:47,230
How'd you get it?

176
00:18:47,422 --> 00:18:49,332
That's what I really want to know.

177
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,983
How in the hell did a big
money-scribbling asshole like you...

178
00:18:53,151 --> 00:18:55,671
...get down to a little shitsplat town
in Mississippi...

179
00:18:55,838 --> 00:18:58,391
...and steal my goddamn story?

180
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,217
-Drop it.
-Drop it?

181
00:19:00,382 --> 00:19:03,611
Drop it. What in the hell
do you mean, drop it?

182
00:19:04,382 --> 00:19:08,343
You said you wrote your story in 1 997.
I wrote mine in late '94.

183
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:11,827
It was published for the first time
in June 1 995 in a magazine.

184
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,716
Nice try, Mr. Shooter,
but I beat you by two years.

185
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:17,083
If anybody's got a bitch about
plagiarism, it's me.

186
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,063
You lie!

187
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,846
-No, I don't!
-Prove it!

188
00:19:22,014 --> 00:19:23,989
I don't have to prove a thing to you.

189
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:28,414
Go look for yourself. Ellery Queen's
Mystery Magazine, June 1 995.

190
00:19:28,574 --> 00:19:31,509
-And how am I supposed to find that?
-That's not my problem.

191
00:19:31,678 --> 00:19:35,540
Am I supposed to drive down to your
house in Riverdale, New York...

192
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,460
...and ask your wife, Amy, for it?

193
00:19:39,423 --> 00:19:41,245
I read it on your book jacket.

194
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,988
That's not my house. That's hers.

195
00:19:44,158 --> 00:19:45,402
What the hell does that mean?

196
00:19:45,566 --> 00:19:48,949
What do you think, you ignorant hick?
I'm in the middle of a divorce.

197
00:19:49,118 --> 00:19:52,948
D-l-V-O-R-C-E. Divorce.

198
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,838
You strike me as the kind of guy...

199
00:19:55,999 --> 00:20:00,309
...who's on the lookout for a head
he can knock off with a shovel.

200
00:20:00,478 --> 00:20:04,407
But what you don't understand is,
if we do start to fight...

201
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,605
...it's not going to end...

202
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:10,492
...until one or the other of us
is dead.

203
00:20:14,878 --> 00:20:18,261
Hold your water,
I'm just getting my smokes.

204
00:20:19,454 --> 00:20:20,632
I don't smoke.

205
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:22,325
I'll give you three days.

206
00:20:22,494 --> 00:20:26,007
Call your ex and get her to send you
the magazine with your story in it...

207
00:20:26,174 --> 00:20:28,345
...if there is such a magazine...

208
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,787
...and I'll be back.

209
00:20:29,951 --> 00:20:33,431
If I show you, will you go back where
you came from and leave me alone?

210
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,652
Three days.

211
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:40,733
Always a pleasure to meet a reader.

212
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:02,394
I don't want to call her.

213
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,845
I want to go to sleep.
I want to take a nap.

214
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,271
Okay. No nap.

215
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,245
I give her a call
about the magazine...

216
00:21:12,414 --> 00:21:15,545
...I go write some crap
for a couple of hours...

217
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,744
...and then I get to take a nap. Right?

218
00:21:19,326 --> 00:21:20,503
Chico?

219
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:23,700
Chico

220
00:21:23,871 --> 00:21:26,292
Don't be discouraged

221
00:21:26,462 --> 00:21:28,982
All right, go ahead and be
discouraged, you blind bastard.

222
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,099
See if I care.

223
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:35,318
And returned to the couch...

224
00:21:37,055 --> 00:21:38,778
...in shame...

225
00:21:39,294 --> 00:21:41,181
...degradation...

226
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:49,117
...and sloth.

227
00:21:49,822 --> 00:21:51,229
Sloth.

228
00:24:06,366 --> 00:24:07,991
Shooter!

229
00:24:13,214 --> 00:24:15,189
I'll get you for this!

230
00:24:16,158 --> 00:24:17,620
You hear me?

231
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,157
I'll get you for this!

232
00:24:47,838 --> 00:24:50,326
Chico? He killed Chico?

233
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,459
Yeah. Last night around 9.
I was asleep.

234
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,386
Look, he left this.

235
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:59,827
"You have three days.
I'm not joking. No police."

236
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,813
Anytime somebody sits down
and writes "No police"...

237
00:25:02,974 --> 00:25:06,771
...that's exactly the time that a fella
should get himself over to the police.

238
00:25:06,942 --> 00:25:09,212
Yeah, well, that's what I figured.

239
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:13,083
So, what I've got is a detailed
description of him and his car.

240
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:16,508
Type a little harder.
You have to get through the carbon.

241
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,393
I didn't get the license plate number...

242
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:22,552
...but I'm sure it had Mississippi tags,
and I think that it started with an A.

243
00:25:22,718 --> 00:25:24,027
That's what I see in my mind.

244
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,314
Needlepoint. Can you believe it?
Doc says it's good for the arthritis.

245
00:25:30,174 --> 00:25:33,109
Anyway, anything you can find out
about this guy, I'd appreciate it.

246
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:36,594
I must cut quite an intimidating
law-enforcement figure, huh?

247
00:25:38,014 --> 00:25:42,586
I'd like to know what I'm dealing with.
Maybe he has a violent history.

248
00:25:43,006 --> 00:25:46,137
Maybe you can find him, talk to him.
I think that would be better.

249
00:25:46,302 --> 00:25:48,888
So you got yourself a member
of the crazy folks tribe?

250
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:52,787
Yeah. I mean, they pop up
every once in a while.

251
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:55,806
I suppose it's just the price
of selling a few books.

252
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,390
Sorry.

253
00:26:00,094 --> 00:26:02,549
Here's the.... Here's that description.

254
00:26:02,718 --> 00:26:05,402
Of course, killing an animal
isn't like killing a man.

255
00:26:05,918 --> 00:26:07,925
I'm not even sure it's a crime,
come to think.

256
00:26:08,094 --> 00:26:10,199
Come on, it's gotta be.
What about animal cruelty?

257
00:26:10,366 --> 00:26:12,733
What about destruction
of private property? What about--?

258
00:26:12,894 --> 00:26:14,552
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe.

259
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:16,627
Okay.

260
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:20,310
First thing I'm going to need
is a description.

261
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:24,663
Tell me the truth. Did you steal it?

262
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,291
What? No!

263
00:26:26,462 --> 00:26:29,277
Kind of an amazing coincidence,
don't you think?

264
00:26:29,438 --> 00:26:31,096
The stories being so much alike?

265
00:26:31,262 --> 00:26:34,743
Obviously he copied me. Would you
like to choose a side before we go on?

266
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:37,463
I'm on your side.
But I still need to know the truth.

267
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,386
Which kind of situation is this?

268
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:43,292
Is he a regular wacko like you've had
before, in which case I can help...

269
00:26:43,454 --> 00:26:45,820
...or something you should talk
to your lawyer about?

270
00:26:45,982 --> 00:26:49,691
No, this guy is just simply
out of his mind. That's all it is.

271
00:26:49,854 --> 00:26:51,894
Fine. Okay.

272
00:26:52,062 --> 00:26:53,622
What do you want me to do?

273
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,408
I want you to help me
in the same way that--

274
00:26:57,374 --> 00:27:01,597
In the same way that you did before.

275
00:27:01,758 --> 00:27:03,383
He wasn't this crazy.

276
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,438
That guy was just
an obsessed reader...

277
00:27:05,598 --> 00:27:08,631
...who couldn't tell real life from
the crap you make up for a living.

278
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:10,172
No offense.

279
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,885
Now, this Shooter guy,
he threaten your life?

280
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:16,824
-He put a screwdriver through my dog.
-Well, he did break a law...

281
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,892
...but it doesn't seem to be a
very important law in Tashmore Lake.

282
00:27:20,062 --> 00:27:22,550
The sheriff must be a cat person.

283
00:27:22,718 --> 00:27:24,660
Yeah, well, I don't exactly feel safe...

284
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,929
...with a 70-year-old arthritic sheriff
watching my back.

285
00:27:28,094 --> 00:27:29,883
Are you gonna help me or not?

286
00:27:30,046 --> 00:27:31,223
Let's see...

287
00:27:31,774 --> 00:27:35,735
...I got a corporate loyalty thing
I got to be back for on Friday...

288
00:27:35,901 --> 00:27:37,789
...but I can give you
a couple of days.

289
00:27:38,142 --> 00:27:39,571
Okay.

290
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,076
My story came out a couple years...

291
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:46,555
...before he says he wrote his.

292
00:27:46,718 --> 00:27:48,692
I've got a copy of the original
at Amy's house.

293
00:27:48,862 --> 00:27:51,350
I was just gonna stop by
on my way upstate and pick it up.

294
00:27:51,518 --> 00:27:53,721
-Amy's house?
-Yeah.

295
00:27:53,885 --> 00:27:56,787
-Amy and I split up six months ago.
-I'm sorry.

296
00:27:57,694 --> 00:27:58,904
Yeah, me too.

297
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,663
-Amicable?
-Not remotely.

298
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,245
What happened? You finally nail one
of your groupies at a book signing?

299
00:28:04,414 --> 00:28:06,301
The Omaha Barnes and Noble?

300
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,485
That was a dick thing to say,
you know? Rotten profession.

301
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:16,668
I apologize.

302
00:28:17,406 --> 00:28:20,024
-You were saying?
-I was saying...

303
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:25,426
...that if it's just proof that this guy
wants, fine. I show him the magazine.

304
00:28:25,598 --> 00:28:27,703
But I think maybe you should
be with me when I do.

305
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,146
No shit,
I'm gonna be with you.

306
00:28:29,598 --> 00:28:32,468
-You remember my rate?
-Yeah. An obscene fortune, right?

307
00:28:32,862 --> 00:28:35,829
You'll see a black Cadillac in the
driveway tonight when you get home.

308
00:28:35,998 --> 00:28:38,267
Don't freak out,
it's me keeping an eye on things.

309
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,772
Okay.

310
00:28:39,934 --> 00:28:42,803
Get a good night's sleep.
You don't look too hot.

311
00:29:20,189 --> 00:29:23,572
This is not my beautiful house.

312
00:29:24,478 --> 00:29:27,773
This is not my beautiful wife.

313
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,764
Anymore.

314
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:44,340
-You scared the shit out of me.
-Hey, I'm sorry about that.

315
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,877
This last week must have
finally caught up with me.

316
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:49,427
-That's very reassuring. Thanks.
-Hey, relax, Hemingway.

317
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,605
I was only out 1 0 minutes,
swear to God.

318
00:30:51,774 --> 00:30:54,010
Already checked the place.
Everything is fine.

319
00:30:54,173 --> 00:30:56,508
Just waiting for you to get back
to let you know.

320
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:01,209
You think you'll be
sticking around tonight, or...?

321
00:31:01,374 --> 00:31:04,243
No. Not unless you want me to.

322
00:31:05,918 --> 00:31:08,252
No. No.

323
00:31:08,413 --> 00:31:11,762
No, I'm sure it's fine in there.

324
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,652
Nope.

325
00:31:15,389 --> 00:31:16,851
No monsters up here.

326
00:31:17,022 --> 00:31:18,428
Did you check under my bed?

327
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,019
Even in your toy chest.

328
00:31:20,189 --> 00:31:23,353
I'll be back in the morning.
Start asking around town.

329
00:31:23,518 --> 00:31:25,460
What the hell you gonna
do with that, sailor?

330
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:28,085
Find out who else saw your nut-job.

331
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:29,781
Tom Greenleaf.

332
00:31:31,902 --> 00:31:34,553
Tom Greenleaf passed by
when I was talking to Shooter.

333
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:37,467
He waved at us, so he must have
gotten a good look at him.

334
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:40,150
Tom Greenleaf.
How do I get ahold of him?

335
00:31:40,318 --> 00:31:42,423
Bowie's store,
breakfast every morning, 9 a.m.

336
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,629
Okay, I got it. Don't worry.

337
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,547
Once I find out where
this Shooter's staying...

338
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:51,769
...I'll stop in for a little freak-me-out
chat. Use the word "we" a lot.

339
00:31:51,934 --> 00:31:56,090
"We know what you're doing. We want
it to stop. We're watching you."

340
00:31:56,573 --> 00:32:00,086
Trust me, he'll hit the road so hard,
it'll hit back.

341
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:05,434
Hey. You know what?
Are you staying in town tonight?

342
00:32:05,598 --> 00:32:07,507
Yeah, some motel out by Route 9.

343
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:10,809
Irv's Lakesider, I think it's called.
You know the place?

344
00:32:13,438 --> 00:32:15,194
-Yeah, I know the place.
-Okay.

345
00:32:15,358 --> 00:32:16,635
Good night.

346
00:32:50,237 --> 00:32:51,448
Hello?

347
00:33:00,158 --> 00:33:01,565
Shit.

348
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,781
I know you're in there, shithead!

349
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,732
If you don't come out
by the time I count to five...

350
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,866
...I'm gonna come in swinging.

351
00:34:53,405 --> 00:34:54,779
One.

352
00:34:56,349 --> 00:34:57,975
Two!

353
00:35:06,845 --> 00:35:08,471
I killed a mirror.

354
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:17,052
And my shower door.

355
00:36:12,222 --> 00:36:16,313
I don't care. I'm just gonna smoke.
I'm just gonna totally smoke.

356
00:36:16,477 --> 00:36:16,637
I'll finish these, go to the store...

357
00:36:16,637 --> 00:36:18,295
I'll finish these, go to the store...

358
00:36:18,461 --> 00:36:21,527
...get a brand-new pack,
smoke the shit out of that one.

359
00:36:42,013 --> 00:36:44,086
Thought you didn't smoke.

360
00:36:49,054 --> 00:36:51,574
I took it up recently for my health.

361
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:53,880
How are you, Mr. Rainey?

362
00:36:54,558 --> 00:36:57,340
Oh, I'm just peachy, Mr. Shooter.
How are you?

363
00:36:57,501 --> 00:37:00,916
Well, it sounded like you pitched a fit
or something in there.

364
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:04,085
I don't think you're really
all that well.

365
00:37:04,605 --> 00:37:09,494
Stealing from another man, that don't
seem to have ever bothered you none.

366
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,512
Being caught up on, though.

367
00:37:13,181 --> 00:37:16,378
Or maybe it's just that
successful writers like you...

368
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:19,771
...throw tantrums when things
don't go the way they expect.

369
00:37:20,317 --> 00:37:22,140
Why didn't you get that magazine?

370
00:37:22,302 --> 00:37:25,302
You were down there at
her house today, weren't you?

371
00:37:25,693 --> 00:37:28,759
If I get this story
and I show it to you...

372
00:37:29,022 --> 00:37:30,996
...will you then kindly disappear?

373
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:35,573
There isn't any magazine
with that story in it, Mr. Rainey.

374
00:37:35,742 --> 00:37:37,367
You and me, we know that.

375
00:37:37,693 --> 00:37:39,417
Okay, then.

376
00:37:40,638 --> 00:37:43,899
What can we do to make you
feel better?

377
00:37:50,525 --> 00:37:52,630
I want you to fix it.

378
00:37:52,957 --> 00:37:54,452
What would you like me to fix?

379
00:37:54,621 --> 00:37:56,476
My ending.

380
00:37:56,637 --> 00:37:58,710
The one you wrecked.

381
00:37:59,261 --> 00:38:01,116
I can't decide what's worse...

382
00:38:01,373 --> 00:38:05,017
...stealing my story
or ruining the ending.

383
00:38:05,213 --> 00:38:06,740
Mine was perfect.

384
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:09,915
-I don't think I read your whole story.
-Oh, I bet you did.

385
00:38:11,037 --> 00:38:15,031
"'l know I can do it,'
Todd Downey said...

386
00:38:15,198 --> 00:38:19,540
...helping himself to another ear
of corn from the steaming bowl.

387
00:38:19,709 --> 00:38:21,170
'I'm sure that in time...

388
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:25,498
...her death will be a mystery
even to me."'

389
00:38:25,662 --> 00:38:30,364
That's how the story ends, pilgrim.
It's the only ending.

390
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:33,820
You're going to write it for me
and get it published.

391
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:36,250
And it's gonna have my name on it.

392
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:39,196
I'd be more than happy to write your
ending, Mr. Shooter.

393
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,784
Saw that wife of yours
coming out of the house.

394
00:38:47,261 --> 00:38:50,295
-She's purty.
-My wife?

395
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,698
Why don't we just
leave her out of this.

396
00:38:54,237 --> 00:38:56,212
Would if I could...

397
00:38:56,382 --> 00:39:00,091
...but I'm starting to think you ain't
gonna leave me that option.

398
00:39:05,022 --> 00:39:07,411
You want to wake up from
one of your stupid naps...

399
00:39:07,581 --> 00:39:09,883
...and find Amy nailed
to your garbage bin?

400
00:39:10,045 --> 00:39:13,820
Or turn on the radio some morning
and hear she came off second-best...

401
00:39:13,981 --> 00:39:17,330
...in a match with the chain saw
you keep out in the shed?

402
00:39:19,101 --> 00:39:20,530
Do you?

403
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:24,694
You can't get away with it.

404
00:39:28,509 --> 00:39:29,851
I know what you did...

405
00:39:30,013 --> 00:39:34,486
...and I ain't quitting
until right gets put right.

406
00:40:52,061 --> 00:40:54,483
-ls that you, John Wayne?
-Mort?

407
00:40:54,941 --> 00:40:56,599
Are you there? Mort?

408
00:40:56,765 --> 00:40:59,132
Yes, Amy, I'm here.
Just lower your voice a little.

409
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:00,602
-What is it?
-Where have you been?

410
00:41:00,765 --> 00:41:03,482
I've been trying to get ahold of you
all night and this morning.

411
00:41:03,645 --> 00:41:04,823
I was asleep.

412
00:41:04,989 --> 00:41:07,193
Oh, great, so you unplugged
the phone?

413
00:41:07,837 --> 00:41:09,398
How may I assist you, Amy?

414
00:41:09,565 --> 00:41:11,158
Oh, God, Mort.

415
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:13,528
What happened? What?

416
00:41:13,693 --> 00:41:17,173
Someone burned down our house.
That's what happened, okay?

417
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:20,538
-What?
-Someone burned down our house!

418
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:41,334
Bye, babe.

419
00:41:42,909 --> 00:41:44,087
Pardon me, miss.

420
00:41:44,253 --> 00:41:46,970
-You left $1 00 on the dresser.
-Shut up!

421
00:41:47,133 --> 00:41:49,369
Surely the escort service told
you I was three.

422
00:41:49,533 --> 00:41:50,875
Please.

423
00:41:51,165 --> 00:41:54,132
Some guys are less, some guys
are 1 00 if you like that kind of thing.

424
00:41:54,301 --> 00:41:57,148
Some guys are less than that,
but I'm three. I happen to be three.

425
00:41:57,309 --> 00:41:59,251
There's something
on your mouth there.

426
00:41:59,677 --> 00:42:01,051
Bye.

427
00:42:12,061 --> 00:42:13,555
Mort!

428
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,492
-Hi.
-Hi.

429
00:42:23,677 --> 00:42:27,026
-I'm really sorry about all this, Amy.
-So am l.

430
00:42:27,677 --> 00:42:29,139
Me too.

431
00:42:29,501 --> 00:42:30,679
Thank you, Ted.

432
00:42:30,845 --> 00:42:33,016
-Mr. and Mrs. Rainey?
-Yes.

433
00:42:33,181 --> 00:42:37,338
-You the owners?
-Yes, we are. We were the owners.

434
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:40,152
Were the owners?
What do you mean?

435
00:42:40,317 --> 00:42:42,041
You don't own it anymore?

436
00:42:42,205 --> 00:42:44,922
Were Mr. and Mrs. Rainey.
Are the owners.

437
00:42:45,085 --> 00:42:48,052
-I'm Steven Bradley, Riverdale P D.
-How do you do? Ted Milner.

438
00:42:48,221 --> 00:42:50,326
-This is Fire Chief Wickersham.
-Chief.

439
00:42:50,493 --> 00:42:53,755
We won't keep you long. The insurance
investigator needs to see you at 3.

440
00:42:53,917 --> 00:42:57,364
You're victims of arson. The fire was
started by an incendiary device...

441
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,730
...made with a champagne bottle
and a couple of quarts of gasoline.

442
00:43:00,893 --> 00:43:02,518
Oh, that really works, then, eh?

443
00:43:02,685 --> 00:43:04,212
So first question:

444
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:06,006
Enemies. You got any?

445
00:43:06,173 --> 00:43:08,955
-No. No one.
-No, no. Not a soul.

446
00:43:09,724 --> 00:43:12,212
Bother you if I answer
one or two of these, Ted?

447
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,290
It's okay. It's cool.

448
00:43:18,205 --> 00:43:19,514
Yeah.

449
00:43:20,733 --> 00:43:22,227
I have an enemy.

450
00:43:22,653 --> 00:43:24,857
Sorry I wasn't there to meet you
this morning.

451
00:43:25,021 --> 00:43:29,975
I spent last night poking around the
site with a flashlight and a Polaroid.

452
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:32,377
Oops. Broke one of my own rules.

453
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:35,890
I don't like to call it "the site."
It wasn't a site, it was a house.

454
00:43:36,061 --> 00:43:38,744
Your house,
and I'm sorry for your loss.

455
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:41,429
Thank you very much, Mrs. Evans.

456
00:43:41,597 --> 00:43:44,499
It still says "Mrs."? Fran is fine.

457
00:43:45,533 --> 00:43:46,962
These meetings are hard.

458
00:43:47,133 --> 00:43:49,686
People in your situation
are already upset...

459
00:43:49,853 --> 00:43:51,893
...and quite often
they see an investigator...

460
00:43:52,061 --> 00:43:54,778
...as an accusation that they've
torched their own property.

461
00:43:54,941 --> 00:43:57,429
And in this case, you've given us
a plausible suspect...

462
00:43:57,597 --> 00:44:00,018
...who we'll investigate aggressively
along with the police.

463
00:44:00,189 --> 00:44:03,418
But in the meantime, that's a list of
your claimed insurable property.

464
00:44:03,581 --> 00:44:07,705
Read it and sign an affidavit swearing
that the items still belong to you...

465
00:44:07,869 --> 00:44:10,073
...and that they were inside
when the fire occurred.

466
00:44:10,237 --> 00:44:12,604
I'm told there was a separation
of residence recently...

467
00:44:12,765 --> 00:44:14,620
...so that last bit will be important.

468
00:44:14,781 --> 00:44:16,886
We're going through a divorce.
It's not final yet.

469
00:44:17,053 --> 00:44:19,322
Well, the settlement agreement's
all done.

470
00:44:19,485 --> 00:44:21,208
Everything's been negotiated...

471
00:44:21,372 --> 00:44:24,689
...we're just waiting for it
to be signed by both parties.

472
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,868
I moved out about six months ago...

473
00:44:27,037 --> 00:44:30,266
...and just hadn't gotten around to
hauling all the stuff out yet, so....

474
00:44:30,429 --> 00:44:33,178
Been down that road. Sucks.

475
00:44:33,661 --> 00:44:36,214
These things just have to follow
their natural course.

476
00:44:36,861 --> 00:44:40,756
Things will wrap up when everybody's
ready for that to happen.

477
00:44:41,853 --> 00:44:43,740
That's been my feeling.

478
00:44:44,573 --> 00:44:46,939
In the meantime,
do the best you can with the list.

479
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,508
Thanks.

480
00:45:05,117 --> 00:45:06,939
Do you actually intend
to rubberneck?

481
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,588
I hardly think my concern could be
construed as rubbernecking.

482
00:45:09,757 --> 00:45:10,935
Amy, he's rubbernecking.

483
00:45:11,101 --> 00:45:14,778
I'm not gonna freak out about this,
but, I mean, this is our stuff.

484
00:45:14,941 --> 00:45:16,534
No. All right. He's right.

485
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,970
-This is our stuff.
-He's right. He's right, Ted.

486
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:23,093
He is right. The law says you have
no right to see the listed items at all.

487
00:45:23,261 --> 00:45:27,418
We wink at things like this if nobody
minds, but it seems Mr. Rainey does.

488
00:45:27,581 --> 00:45:30,101
Yes. Mr. Rainey minds a lot.

489
00:45:32,477 --> 00:45:35,924
Would it help matters
if I took a walk around the block?

490
00:45:36,093 --> 00:45:38,362
-Yes, thanks.
-Sure.

491
00:45:39,933 --> 00:45:42,868
Oh, heck, Ted, live a little.
Make it two.

492
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,644
Rubbernecker.

493
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:05,815
Mort.

494
00:46:05,981 --> 00:46:08,119
-Wait. I need to ask you something.
-What?

495
00:46:08,284 --> 00:46:13,303
This guy, Shooter. His story. I mean,
is this situation like the other time?

496
00:46:13,469 --> 00:46:16,502
I'm sorry. I wouldn't bring it up,
but it did happen once before.

497
00:46:16,669 --> 00:46:20,018
Look, that is the only time I've ever
done anything remotely like that.

498
00:46:20,189 --> 00:46:23,385
I paid the guy everything he wanted.
Never happened before or since.

499
00:46:23,548 --> 00:46:25,458
-Okay. Okay.
-Okay.

500
00:46:27,773 --> 00:46:30,140
-Amy.
-What?

501
00:46:32,188 --> 00:46:34,457
Only you, me and the lawyers
know about that, right?

502
00:46:34,749 --> 00:46:36,123
Right.

503
00:46:36,284 --> 00:46:38,554
Because you haven't said
anything to Ted. Surely not.

504
00:46:38,717 --> 00:46:39,993
No.

505
00:46:40,285 --> 00:46:42,586
-Have you said something to Ted?
-Come on!

506
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,009
Well, do I have timing or what?

507
00:46:46,173 --> 00:46:47,580
Yes, you do.

508
00:46:47,741 --> 00:46:50,611
Sorry you had to miss that.
I know how much you like my things.

509
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:53,333
-Oh, Jesus.
-You and me are gonna have a talk.

510
00:46:53,501 --> 00:46:55,508
Be back in 1 0 minutes.

511
00:46:56,765 --> 00:46:58,620
I'm in trouble.

512
00:47:02,589 --> 00:47:05,851
-I've had enough of your bullshit.
-You're a dick.

513
00:47:06,652 --> 00:47:08,245
Do you feel better?

514
00:47:08,412 --> 00:47:09,656
Yes, I do.

515
00:47:09,821 --> 00:47:13,847
Yeah, look, marriages end.
I'm sorry, but I didn't end yours.

516
00:47:14,013 --> 00:47:15,769
It was done by the time I got there.

517
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:18,803
Really? You must've thought her
wedding ring was a little strange.

518
00:47:18,972 --> 00:47:22,649
Oh, man. Listen, I apologized
to you months ago.

519
00:47:22,812 --> 00:47:26,838
I know you don't want me in your life.
I don't want you in mine either.

520
00:47:27,004 --> 00:47:30,266
But until this little divorce thing's
done, not much we can do about it.

521
00:47:30,429 --> 00:47:35,285
But I will not let you upset Amy
any more than you already have.

522
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:39,031
So why don't we just wrap this thing
up and get out of each other's lives--?

523
00:47:42,076 --> 00:47:45,753
Are we getting the message
I'm sending?

524
00:47:46,909 --> 00:47:48,338
Where are we from, Teddy?

525
00:47:50,013 --> 00:47:51,354
Tennessee...

526
00:47:51,997 --> 00:47:53,207
...Morty.

527
00:47:55,004 --> 00:47:56,597
I was gonna say Mississippi.

528
00:47:57,309 --> 00:48:01,717
No. Long way from there.
Little place called Shooter's Bay.

529
00:48:21,341 --> 00:48:22,802
Come on, Karsch.

530
00:48:23,004 --> 00:48:26,201
Five hundred dollars a day.
Where are you when I need you?

531
00:48:52,348 --> 00:48:53,625
What--?

532
00:48:55,292 --> 00:48:57,202
What fresh hell...?

533
00:48:57,373 --> 00:48:59,674
-Yeah?
-Where you been all day?

534
00:49:00,636 --> 00:49:02,327
I might ask you the same question.

535
00:49:02,493 --> 00:49:05,308
Relax, you're fine.
I checked the cabin an hour ago.

536
00:49:05,469 --> 00:49:08,087
Well, he showed up an hour
after you left last night.

537
00:49:08,253 --> 00:49:10,293
Oh, really?
Then he had a busy night.

538
00:49:10,652 --> 00:49:13,522
My office called me about
your Riverdale house. I'm sorry.

539
00:49:13,693 --> 00:49:16,726
The worst part is, I hadn't had
a chance to get the magazine out.

540
00:49:16,893 --> 00:49:18,835
The one with the story he says I stole.

541
00:49:19,005 --> 00:49:20,412
That's gone up in smoke now.

542
00:49:20,573 --> 00:49:23,769
Do you still want to go through with it?
Meeting? Showing him the magazine?

543
00:49:23,932 --> 00:49:25,274
Hell, yes, man.

544
00:49:25,437 --> 00:49:28,786
I've had a shitty year.
I want it settled now. Everything.

545
00:49:28,957 --> 00:49:31,575
Good. I called your agent
when I heard about the house.

546
00:49:31,741 --> 00:49:34,010
I figured he'd have a copy
of the magazine.

547
00:49:34,173 --> 00:49:37,042
He sent the original by UPS
overnight today.

548
00:49:37,212 --> 00:49:38,968
You can pick it up tomorrow after 3.

549
00:49:39,132 --> 00:49:40,758
I knew there was a reason I hired you.

550
00:49:40,925 --> 00:49:42,102
There's something else.

551
00:49:42,909 --> 00:49:45,211
I caught up with your
Tom Greenleaf today.

552
00:49:45,373 --> 00:49:47,926
The guy who drove past you
and Shooter on the lake road.

553
00:49:48,092 --> 00:49:49,434
Well, he's a weird one.

554
00:49:49,596 --> 00:49:52,662
First he says he did go down
to the Lake Drive on Tuesday...

555
00:49:52,828 --> 00:49:54,617
...and he saw you like you said.

556
00:49:54,781 --> 00:49:56,723
But then he gets nervous and says:

557
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:59,610
"No, come to think of it, I didn't.
Didn't see anybody.

558
00:49:59,773 --> 00:50:01,780
Wasn't even on Lake Drive
on Tuesday."

559
00:50:01,949 --> 00:50:05,909
Yeah, well, Tom's old.
Maybe just slipped his mind.

560
00:50:06,076 --> 00:50:07,320
Don't be naive.

561
00:50:07,484 --> 00:50:10,102
He was scared shitless.
Somebody got to him.

562
00:50:10,268 --> 00:50:11,829
Come on, wait.

563
00:50:11,997 --> 00:50:15,128
Why would Shooter care if
Tom Greenleaf knows he's here?

564
00:50:15,293 --> 00:50:17,660
-Well, it depends.
-On what?

565
00:50:17,821 --> 00:50:19,861
On what he plans to do to you.

566
00:50:20,028 --> 00:50:23,444
I'm revising my opinion, Mort.
I don't think Shooter's just some nut.

567
00:50:23,612 --> 00:50:27,769
We need to consider the possibility
that he was hired to do this.

568
00:50:27,933 --> 00:50:32,341
Somebody with a grudge against you
hires a tough guy to rattle you...

569
00:50:32,508 --> 00:50:34,232
...scare you to death.

570
00:50:34,397 --> 00:50:36,601
But he hires the wrong guy.

571
00:50:36,956 --> 00:50:38,996
Things get out of control.

572
00:50:39,164 --> 00:50:41,531
They go further than
they're supposed to.

573
00:50:41,692 --> 00:50:43,285
Dead dogs...

574
00:50:43,452 --> 00:50:45,362
...burnt-down houses.

575
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,573
Now he can't call him off.

576
00:50:49,757 --> 00:50:51,829
-Ted.
-Who?

577
00:50:52,764 --> 00:50:54,171
Ted. Amy's Ted.

578
00:50:54,332 --> 00:50:56,569
The Ted that Amy left me for.

579
00:50:57,181 --> 00:51:00,279
That's why he calls himself Shooter.
Ted wants me to know it's him.

580
00:51:00,444 --> 00:51:03,128
He's trying to intimidate me,
trying to send me a message.

581
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:05,529
-Why? What does he want?
-I don't know.

582
00:51:05,852 --> 00:51:07,543
Did you piss him off?

583
00:51:10,492 --> 00:51:12,729
-I might have.
-Okay, here's what we do.

584
00:51:13,468 --> 00:51:15,672
What proof do you have
that Shooter was there?

585
00:51:15,964 --> 00:51:19,609
Other than the manuscript.
Physical evidence, I'm talking about.

586
00:51:19,804 --> 00:51:23,100
Bruises. I got bruises on my arms
from where he grabbed me.

587
00:51:23,261 --> 00:51:24,635
All right.

588
00:51:25,756 --> 00:51:28,123
You and me are going to
go see Greenleaf together.

589
00:51:28,284 --> 00:51:29,462
All right.

590
00:51:29,629 --> 00:51:32,084
Bring the manuscript.
Bring your bruises.

591
00:51:32,253 --> 00:51:35,569
I'm gonna push the guy hard,
make it impossible for him to lie.

592
00:51:35,741 --> 00:51:38,643
If he'll tell the police he was
threatened too, we've got something.

593
00:51:39,933 --> 00:51:41,427
Bowie's store, breakfast?

594
00:51:41,597 --> 00:51:42,873
9 a.m. sharp.

595
00:51:43,036 --> 00:51:44,247
I'll see you there.

596
00:51:44,412 --> 00:51:45,841
And bring your six-gun, pilgrim.

597
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:59,445
It is a good ending.

598
00:52:14,556 --> 00:52:16,149
Oh, shit.

599
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:47,382
Shit.

600
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:07,570
Pall Mall.

601
00:54:09,116 --> 00:54:10,393
Cracker bastard.

602
00:54:36,892 --> 00:54:38,168
Sorry.

603
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,907
Ken?

604
00:54:52,604 --> 00:54:53,913
Tom?

605
00:55:19,996 --> 00:55:21,174
Would you like a pack?

606
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:23,829
I don't smoke.

607
00:55:27,228 --> 00:55:29,562
Did a guy come in here
looking for me around 9:00?

608
00:55:29,725 --> 00:55:32,856
-No.
-Big guy, kind of a New York-cop type.

609
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,962
No. No, that doesn't ring a bell.

610
00:55:35,133 --> 00:55:36,343
I overslept.

611
00:55:36,508 --> 00:55:39,355
Well, maybe he did too,
because he wasn't here.

612
00:55:41,468 --> 00:55:42,646
Yeah.

613
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:26,997
What are you doing here?

614
00:56:27,164 --> 00:56:29,783
Matter of fact, I was just on my way
over to your place.

615
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:32,598
Where's your buddy?

616
00:56:33,756 --> 00:56:36,341
-Came alone.
-Sure you did.

617
00:56:45,628 --> 00:56:46,872
I know what you're up to.

618
00:56:51,292 --> 00:56:52,917
Look, Mort....

619
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:56,980
A lot of what's going on right now
is my fault.

620
00:56:57,341 --> 00:56:59,097
Most of it, in fact.

621
00:57:00,028 --> 00:57:01,205
What do you want?

622
00:57:03,709 --> 00:57:05,302
I want you out of our life.

623
00:57:06,908 --> 00:57:09,079
Gotta sign your papers, Mort.

624
00:57:12,284 --> 00:57:15,252
My divorce papers?
Tell her to send them to my lawyer.

625
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:18,290
She did. He said that you won't return
his calls for weeks.

626
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:20,981
-This is about the settlement?
-Just calm down.

627
00:57:21,148 --> 00:57:22,741
-Money?
-It's not about money.

628
00:57:22,909 --> 00:57:25,080
This is about getting this thing done.

629
00:57:25,244 --> 00:57:28,059
Because I'm afraid if we don't,
who knows where it might go.

630
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,594
I think you know what I mean.

631
00:57:29,756 --> 00:57:32,244
Well, Teddy, I think I do,
but here's the problem:

632
00:57:32,412 --> 00:57:35,957
I don't respond well to intimidation.
Makes me feel icky. You know?

633
00:57:38,108 --> 00:57:41,305
You know, I'm attempting to have
a normal conversation here.

634
00:57:41,468 --> 00:57:42,995
I buried my dog, mister.

635
00:57:45,116 --> 00:57:48,149
This whole thing is out of your
control now. You know it, I know it.

636
00:57:48,316 --> 00:57:50,553
You started this shit,
I'm gonna finish it.

637
00:57:51,548 --> 00:57:55,225
Now, do me a favor, go back
and tell that to your filthy little friend.

638
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,744
God!

639
00:57:59,452 --> 00:58:01,240
Bummer, Ted.

640
00:58:37,628 --> 00:58:40,378
-Yeah?
-Go to where we met the other day.

641
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,427
Walk down the path a little way.

642
00:58:42,588 --> 00:58:45,720
-Why?
-I'll catch up with you this afternoon.

643
00:58:45,884 --> 00:58:49,145
Anybody you call between
now and then is your responsibility.

644
00:59:35,324 --> 00:59:36,698
T om?

645
00:59:42,396 --> 00:59:43,956
Greenleaf?

646
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:27,867
Quarter past 2.

647
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:31,224
You been out about three hours.

648
01:00:31,931 --> 01:00:35,412
Your leg's sleeping.
You laid on the damn thing.

649
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:38,613
Now, I would have moved you,
but I didn't want to wake you.

650
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:40,307
Got tired of waiting.

651
01:00:40,476 --> 01:00:43,378
Almost pinned a note on you.
Decided not to.

652
01:00:43,548 --> 01:00:45,075
You scare too easy.

653
01:00:45,723 --> 01:00:47,927
I wouldn't go too far if I were you.

654
01:00:48,092 --> 01:00:51,224
I hooked you to those two men
in more ways than you know.

655
01:00:51,388 --> 01:00:53,111
You're insane.
I'm going to the police.

656
01:00:53,276 --> 01:00:57,138
Whose screwdriver you think
is in that fella's head?

657
01:00:59,292 --> 01:01:01,332
If you leave them here
and I disappear...

658
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:04,183
...you'll find yourself standing
with your head in the noose...

659
01:01:04,348 --> 01:01:06,323
...and your feet in Crisco.

660
01:01:06,908 --> 01:01:08,468
What do you want from me?

661
01:01:08,636 --> 01:01:11,091
Why, I told you that already,
Mr. Rainey.

662
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:14,904
I want you to fix my story.
The one you stole.

663
01:01:15,068 --> 01:01:16,694
Or ain't you ready to admit it yet?

664
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:20,374
I did not steal your story.

665
01:01:20,539 --> 01:01:24,249
I expect you'll let yourself
go to Greenhaven for murder...

666
01:01:24,412 --> 01:01:25,754
...before you'll admit it.

667
01:01:26,108 --> 01:01:28,180
I have the magazine, you lunatic!

668
01:01:28,348 --> 01:01:29,842
I have the magazine!

669
01:01:30,012 --> 01:01:33,176
I have the goddamn magazine!

670
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:36,471
You have this so-called magazine
right now?

671
01:01:36,636 --> 01:01:38,643
On me, no.

672
01:01:39,004 --> 01:01:40,597
I was gonna go pick it up at 3:00.

673
01:01:41,307 --> 01:01:43,795
There can't be any magazine.

674
01:01:44,028 --> 01:01:47,640
Not with that story in it.
That story is mine.

675
01:01:48,444 --> 01:01:51,542
What do you want? To kill me?
Why don't you just do it? Just kill me.

676
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,301
No, sir.

677
01:01:53,468 --> 01:01:56,218
These others here were gonna
get in the way of our business.

678
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,136
I couldn't have that.

679
01:01:58,876 --> 01:02:01,145
You bring me that story...

680
01:02:01,563 --> 01:02:03,090
...if it exists.

681
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:04,634
Your house in two hours.

682
01:02:04,796 --> 01:02:08,953
You got some heavy lifting here first.
I'd get to it if I were you.

683
01:02:09,499 --> 01:02:11,223
By the way...

684
01:02:11,388 --> 01:02:13,777
...if you talk to that sheriff
of yours again...

685
01:02:13,947 --> 01:02:16,795
...or if you don't show up at 4:00...

686
01:02:17,179 --> 01:02:19,863
...I will burn your life
and every person in it...

687
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:22,897
...Iike a cane field in a high wind.

688
01:02:24,124 --> 01:02:27,190
When I show you the magazine that
has my name on the contents page...

689
01:02:27,356 --> 01:02:29,844
...with my story inside...

690
01:02:30,652 --> 01:02:33,270
-...then what?
-Then I turn myself in.

691
01:02:33,532 --> 01:02:36,532
But I'd take care of myself
before a trial, Mr. Rainey.

692
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,740
Because if things turn out that way...

693
01:02:38,907 --> 01:02:41,493
...then I suppose I am crazy.

694
01:02:42,012 --> 01:02:44,052
And that kind of crazy man...

695
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:47,187
...has no reason or excuse to live.

696
01:02:49,819 --> 01:02:51,314
Listen, you got my hat.

697
01:02:51,483 --> 01:02:54,418
I want it, one way or the other.

698
01:05:27,867 --> 01:05:29,972
-Hello?
-Mort?

699
01:05:30,716 --> 01:05:31,893
Yeah, hi.

700
01:05:32,188 --> 01:05:34,293
I've been so worried about you.
Are you okay?

701
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:37,394
-I'm okay. I'm okay, Amy.
-Are you sure?

702
01:05:37,723 --> 01:05:41,171
When I saw you yesterday,
you seemed so strained. I mean....

703
01:05:43,068 --> 01:05:45,621
-What?
-Do you...?

704
01:05:47,067 --> 01:05:50,416
Do you think things would've been
different if we hadn't lost the baby?

705
01:05:51,228 --> 01:05:54,195
Jesus Christ, I don't--
Amy, I don't know.

706
01:05:54,364 --> 01:05:57,593
Let me call you later. I gotta go.
I gotta be somewhere.

707
01:05:59,451 --> 01:06:01,873
What? What is it, Amy?

708
01:06:03,547 --> 01:06:06,100
Breathe. Breathe.

709
01:06:06,267 --> 01:06:07,761
Take a breath.

710
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:11,539
Where are you? You at Ted's?

711
01:06:11,708 --> 01:06:13,050
Yeah.

712
01:06:14,299 --> 01:06:16,536
How we feeling about
old Ted these days?

713
01:06:19,484 --> 01:06:21,207
I don't know.

714
01:06:22,491 --> 01:06:23,833
I love him, I guess.

715
01:06:27,324 --> 01:06:30,193
-That's good.
-I didn't go with other men, you know.

716
01:06:30,363 --> 01:06:32,949
I always wanted to tell you
that I didn't go with other men.

717
01:06:33,307 --> 01:06:36,690
Only T ed, and only the last few months
after you and me were already over.

718
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:40,405
If we were over while we were still
together, you might've mentioned it...

719
01:06:40,571 --> 01:06:41,815
...because it was news to me.

720
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:44,347
That's because you weren't
there anymore.

721
01:06:44,508 --> 01:06:45,970
You were gone all the time.

722
01:06:46,139 --> 01:06:47,666
I worked at home, Amy!

723
01:06:47,836 --> 01:06:50,356
That's not what I mean.

724
01:06:51,291 --> 01:06:53,779
Even when you were with me,
you were gone, up in your head.

725
01:06:53,948 --> 01:06:57,974
I don't think that I looked in your eyes
and saw you looking back at me...

726
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:00,409
...I mean, really with me,
for the last two years.

727
01:07:00,572 --> 01:07:03,638
You know what, you're right.
You're absolutely right. It's all my fault.

728
01:07:03,804 --> 01:07:06,586
No. I was a chickenshit.

729
01:07:09,052 --> 01:07:13,176
Ted wanted us to tell you together.
He kept asking, I kept putting it off.

730
01:07:14,012 --> 01:07:16,761
I'll never forget that look
on your face.

731
01:07:16,988 --> 01:07:18,417
Get out! Get out!

732
01:07:19,004 --> 01:07:21,076
-I gotta go.
-Mort, wait. Can't we just--?

733
01:07:21,243 --> 01:07:22,966
No! I've gotta go.

734
01:07:23,131 --> 01:07:25,750
-Will you call me if you need me?
-I doubt it.

735
01:07:25,915 --> 01:07:28,665
-Can I come up there?
-Why on earth would you do that?

736
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:32,469
You still haven't signed
the papers yet, Mort.

737
01:07:32,987 --> 01:07:35,224
I know you don't want to deal with it.
Me neither.

738
01:07:35,388 --> 01:07:38,137
But everything's been negotiated.
We don't disagree on a thing.

739
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:41,463
I don't understand why you won't sign.
Don't you want to get it over with?

740
01:07:41,627 --> 01:07:43,122
Unbelievable.

741
01:07:43,868 --> 01:07:46,519
You were worried about me,
and I believed you.

742
01:07:46,683 --> 01:07:48,691
-What an idiot.
-I am worried.

743
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:52,820
You sound like you did six months
ago, and I think it's my fault.

744
01:07:52,987 --> 01:07:56,184
It's my fault, and I wish
I could take it back, but I can't.

745
01:07:56,348 --> 01:07:58,235
I guess you shouldn't have
fucked him, then!

746
01:08:09,628 --> 01:08:11,002
You're not going up there?

747
01:08:11,163 --> 01:08:13,530
I am not going to
dance around this anymore.

748
01:08:13,691 --> 01:08:17,520
Once he signs, it'll be over. We won't
have these horrible conversations.

749
01:08:17,691 --> 01:08:19,349
All right, well, I'm going with you.

750
01:08:19,515 --> 01:08:23,410
I just.... I really think
I should go alone, Ted.

751
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:25,303
Well, that makes no sense.

752
01:08:25,467 --> 01:08:27,704
Just the sight of you
is gonna send him.

753
01:08:27,868 --> 01:08:30,737
I was married to the guy for 1 0 years,
I know how to talk to him.

754
01:08:30,908 --> 01:08:33,242
All I want is for this to be over.

755
01:08:34,044 --> 01:08:35,604
Excuse me.

756
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:38,583
I'll be back around 7.

757
01:08:53,403 --> 01:08:54,865
Hey, Mr. Rainey!

758
01:08:55,035 --> 01:08:56,693
-I'd like to--
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

759
01:09:02,203 --> 01:09:03,894
Hey. Mr. Rainey.

760
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:08,539
Mr. Rainey, are you all right?

761
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:11,794
I'm sorry, my throat just
double-clutched on me for a second.

762
01:09:11,963 --> 01:09:14,200
-You're very pale.
-Yeah, thank you.

763
01:09:14,364 --> 01:09:17,680
Did the UPS guy
drop anything off for me?

764
01:09:19,004 --> 01:09:21,338
-Just the one thing.
-Pardon me?

765
01:09:22,459 --> 01:09:23,703
Just the one thing, I said.

766
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:25,940
-Oh. Yeah. Thank you.
-Welcome.

767
01:09:26,107 --> 01:09:29,424
Post office would have a cow if they
knew we handled the UPS guy's stuff.

768
01:09:29,595 --> 01:09:32,312
I know that,
and I certainly appreciate it.

769
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:34,423
You won't tell them, will you?

770
01:09:35,036 --> 01:09:36,891
-No way.
-Good.

771
01:09:37,627 --> 01:09:39,602
Because I saw what you did.

772
01:09:45,115 --> 01:09:47,384
-I'm sorry?
-I said, they'd shoot me if you did.

773
01:09:48,795 --> 01:09:51,097
You ought to go home and lie down,
Mr. Rainey.

774
01:09:51,292 --> 01:09:52,502
You don't look well at all.

775
01:09:53,116 --> 01:09:56,182
Yeah, that's.... That's a good idea.

776
01:10:00,667 --> 01:10:01,845
Cute.

777
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:20,657
-Got a minute?
-Well, no. I really don't right now.

778
01:10:20,827 --> 01:10:22,802
But I'll give you a call later.

779
01:10:24,315 --> 01:10:26,257
Okay. Sure.

780
01:10:31,643 --> 01:10:33,945
I'm gonna call you
on the phone, okay?

781
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:42,610
Okay.

782
01:11:12,251 --> 01:11:14,455
Nineteen ninety-five.

783
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:16,826
Contents.

784
01:11:19,131 --> 01:11:21,465
Eighty-three. Eighty-three.

785
01:11:25,563 --> 01:11:26,840
Eighty-one.

786
01:11:27,387 --> 01:11:28,762
Eighty-two.

787
01:11:29,372 --> 01:11:31,379
Ninety-nine.

788
01:11:36,731 --> 01:11:38,520
Ninety-nine.

789
01:11:39,771 --> 01:11:41,266
You cut it out.

790
01:11:42,651 --> 01:11:44,888
You son of a bitch.

791
01:11:48,187 --> 01:11:49,616
You cut it...

792
01:11:50,683 --> 01:11:52,407
...out of the magazine.

793
01:11:53,435 --> 01:11:56,304
Wait a minute.
How would he do that?

794
01:11:56,763 --> 01:11:58,388
I don't know...

795
01:11:59,611 --> 01:12:01,040
...but he did it.

796
01:12:01,787 --> 01:12:03,445
Think about it.

797
01:12:04,923 --> 01:12:06,232
How?

798
01:12:07,931 --> 01:12:09,622
I don't know.

799
01:12:50,972 --> 01:12:52,695
Why'd you put it on?

800
01:12:53,243 --> 01:12:54,705
I don't know.

801
01:12:55,195 --> 01:12:56,886
Maybe he wanted you to.

802
01:12:57,051 --> 01:12:59,123
Why would he want me
to put his hat on?

803
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:01,047
Maybe he wants you to....

804
01:13:01,851 --> 01:13:03,444
Maybe he wants me to what?

805
01:13:04,443 --> 01:13:05,850
To get confused.

806
01:13:06,011 --> 01:13:09,273
Oh, I'm already confused, pilgrim.
Plenty confused.

807
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:11,442
So don't talk to me about confusion.

808
01:13:11,611 --> 01:13:15,288
Wait a minute. Back up just a sec.
What about that?

809
01:13:15,643 --> 01:13:17,072
What about what?

810
01:13:17,243 --> 01:13:19,829
Well, "pilgrim." "Shooter's Bay."

811
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:22,548
And the half a dozen other details
you've chosen to ignore.

812
01:13:22,715 --> 01:13:26,643
You know what? You're nuts. I don't
need to listen to this shit from you.

813
01:13:26,811 --> 01:13:28,753
Are all these things coincidences?

814
01:13:28,923 --> 01:13:30,963
I'm wearing his bruises, aren't l?

815
01:13:31,323 --> 01:13:33,745
-Aren't l?
-Are you?

816
01:13:34,747 --> 01:13:35,925
Well....

817
01:13:41,531 --> 01:13:43,287
This doesn't make any sense.

818
01:13:43,451 --> 01:13:47,281
Would you like to hear something that
does make sense? Call the police.

819
01:13:47,451 --> 01:13:50,866
Call Dave Newsome, tell him to come
here this second and lock you up...

820
01:13:51,035 --> 01:13:53,207
...before you can do
any more damage.

821
01:13:53,371 --> 01:13:55,543
I'm gonna get a knife
and cut you out of me.

822
01:13:56,315 --> 01:13:58,736
Before you kill anyone else.

823
01:13:59,707 --> 01:14:01,562
I didn't kill anybody.

824
01:14:07,035 --> 01:14:09,523
-You had a gun.
-Wasn't loaded.

825
01:14:09,691 --> 01:14:11,382
-Really?
-No.

826
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:14,002
You almost killed them.
You wanted to.

827
01:14:14,171 --> 01:14:15,698
The gun was not loaded!

828
01:14:15,867 --> 01:14:17,525
-You still want to.
-Shut up!

829
01:14:17,691 --> 01:14:19,960
Listen to me.
Because this is how it happens.

830
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:22,098
-This is how it happens to people.
-Shut up!

831
01:14:22,267 --> 01:14:24,755
There is no John Shooter.

832
01:14:26,268 --> 01:14:29,017
There never has been.
You invented him.

833
01:14:29,563 --> 01:14:32,312
Listen to me, not to him,
before it's too late.

834
01:14:32,475 --> 01:14:33,686
Leave me alone!

835
01:14:37,371 --> 01:14:39,259
You are alone.

836
01:14:59,387 --> 01:15:00,914
You're not handling this.

837
01:15:01,211 --> 01:15:02,553
What you're doing is wrong.

838
01:15:02,715 --> 01:15:04,176
You have no idea
what you're doing.

839
01:15:04,347 --> 01:15:08,657
You've been eating potato chips
this way for 30 years. For 30 years.

840
01:15:13,659 --> 01:15:15,634
Sister found out about
the broken window.

841
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:18,007
The school had to be withdrawn
from the competition.

842
01:15:18,171 --> 01:15:20,854
Sister found out about
the broken windows.

843
01:15:21,019 --> 01:15:25,394
Then she got up from the table.
We didn't talk for the rest of the night.

844
01:15:25,595 --> 01:15:27,831
Todd Downey thought a woman
who'd steal your love--

845
01:15:27,995 --> 01:15:30,035
-What does Todd have to do with it?
-Everything.

846
01:15:30,203 --> 01:15:31,828
I'm starting to believe
Todd was right.

847
01:15:31,995 --> 01:15:34,362
Everything that you're doing
is wrong.

848
01:15:35,483 --> 01:15:37,338
What is happening to me?

849
01:15:37,755 --> 01:15:42,938
Oh, I think you know.
I think you have a real good idea.

850
01:15:43,707 --> 01:15:44,885
You don't exist.

851
01:15:45,051 --> 01:15:48,760
Me? I exist, Mr. Rainey.

852
01:15:49,595 --> 01:15:52,529
I exist because you made me.

853
01:15:52,827 --> 01:15:55,510
-Check it out.
-You thought me up.

854
01:15:55,675 --> 01:15:57,780
I'm a dairy farmer from Mississippi.

855
01:15:57,947 --> 01:15:59,540
Gave me my name.

856
01:15:59,867 --> 01:16:02,769
Told me everything
you wanted me to do.

857
01:16:15,099 --> 01:16:18,361
I did them things
so you wouldn't have to.

858
01:16:18,523 --> 01:16:20,694
Right up there, Tom.
We were standing right there.

859
01:16:20,859 --> 01:16:22,615
Yeah, I know, Mort. I saw you.

860
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:25,496
I didn't want to say it in front of him,
but you were alone.

861
01:16:26,522 --> 01:16:30,646
I know, Tom. Look, just pull over for a
second. I want to show you something.

862
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:37,333
Didn't have the stomach to do it
yourself, but you knew I did.

863
01:16:39,867 --> 01:16:41,241
Are we done yet?

864
01:16:41,403 --> 01:16:44,305
We got things all cleaned up
around here?

865
01:16:44,859 --> 01:16:47,412
What's the real reason I come for?

866
01:16:49,147 --> 01:16:51,962
-Fix the story.
-That's right.

867
01:16:52,955 --> 01:16:54,132
Fix the ending.

868
01:16:54,459 --> 01:16:55,801
Got to fix the ending.

869
01:16:55,963 --> 01:16:58,930
And how exactly do you suppose
we ought to do that?

870
01:17:22,683 --> 01:17:24,112
Mort?

871
01:18:10,106 --> 01:18:11,601
Mort?

872
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:16,309
Are you there?
I saw your car outside.

873
01:18:20,410 --> 01:18:21,872
Hello?

874
01:18:47,611 --> 01:18:49,105
Mort?

875
01:18:54,779 --> 01:18:55,956
Chico?

876
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:22,097
That explains a lot.

877
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:26,936
What the hell?

878
01:20:50,875 --> 01:20:52,304
Hi.

879
01:20:58,970 --> 01:21:00,880
Jesus, Mort.

880
01:21:03,931 --> 01:21:05,687
Where'd you get that old thing?
The attic?

881
01:21:05,979 --> 01:21:07,670
It's mine.

882
01:21:08,666 --> 01:21:10,739
Wasn't ever anybody else's.

883
01:21:13,307 --> 01:21:15,194
Mort, what's wrong?

884
01:21:15,355 --> 01:21:17,689
You got you a wrong number, missus.

885
01:21:19,419 --> 01:21:20,597
Ain't no Mort here.

886
01:21:21,435 --> 01:21:22,645
Mort's dead.

887
01:21:23,291 --> 01:21:24,785
He did a lot of squirming around...

888
01:21:24,955 --> 01:21:29,177
...but in the end he couldn't lie to
himself anymore, let alone to me.

889
01:21:29,338 --> 01:21:32,404
Now, I never put a hand on him,
missus. I swear.

890
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:34,163
He took the coward's way out.

891
01:21:34,330 --> 01:21:36,981
-Why are you talking this way?
-That's just the way I talk.

892
01:21:37,243 --> 01:21:38,421
You're scaring me.

893
01:21:38,586 --> 01:21:41,139
It don't matter.
You won't be scared long.

894
01:21:58,107 --> 01:21:59,317
Oh, God. Oh, God.

895
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,032
Help!

896
01:22:36,698 --> 01:22:39,601
I'm about done fussing with you.

897
01:22:54,395 --> 01:22:56,729
I am so sorry, missus...

898
01:22:56,890 --> 01:22:59,127
...but right is right
and fair is fair...

899
01:22:59,291 --> 01:23:01,200
...and something has got to be done.

900
01:23:03,258 --> 01:23:06,128
By the way, I want you to know
that none of this was my idea.

901
01:23:06,298 --> 01:23:07,924
It was Mr. Rainey all along.

902
01:23:08,091 --> 01:23:10,163
You are Mort Rainey.

903
01:23:10,330 --> 01:23:11,890
I got a place for you.

904
01:23:12,058 --> 01:23:13,968
You are Mort Rainey.

905
01:23:14,138 --> 01:23:16,026
I got it all picked out.

906
01:23:17,339 --> 01:23:19,444
You are Mort Rainey.

907
01:23:30,650 --> 01:23:32,177
Mort....

908
01:23:38,234 --> 01:23:39,663
Amy?

909
01:23:42,362 --> 01:23:44,501
-Amy?
-Ted.

910
01:23:47,674 --> 01:23:50,522
-Amy?
-Ted! No!

911
01:24:05,626 --> 01:24:07,219
No!

912
01:24:16,026 --> 01:24:19,026
"'l know I can do it,'
Todd Downey said...

913
01:24:19,931 --> 01:24:24,022
...helping himself to another ear
of corn from the steaming bowl.

914
01:24:25,659 --> 01:24:27,961
'I'm sure that in time...

915
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:32,400
...her death will be a mystery...

916
01:24:33,914 --> 01:24:35,769
...even to me."'

917
01:24:54,586 --> 01:24:55,928
Hi.

918
01:24:56,731 --> 01:24:58,160
Hi.

919
01:25:04,634 --> 01:25:05,812
I'm kind of late.

920
01:25:14,938 --> 01:25:16,280
Hi.

921
01:25:16,827 --> 01:25:18,201
Hi.

922
01:25:18,747 --> 01:25:20,634
-Braces.
-Yeah.

923
01:25:20,794 --> 01:25:22,834
Getting a few things
straightened out.

924
01:25:27,514 --> 01:25:32,336
I was kind of wondering if sometime
you might possibly be interested in--

925
01:25:32,507 --> 01:25:34,547
I don't need a bag.

926
01:26:03,579 --> 01:26:05,237
Mr. Rainey?

927
01:26:07,290 --> 01:26:09,908
Your front door's open.
I'm coming in.

928
01:26:33,818 --> 01:26:35,379
Mr. Rainey?

929
01:26:36,634 --> 01:26:39,634
-Mort Rainey?
-Oh, hi, Dave.

930
01:26:40,698 --> 01:26:42,640
I didn't hear you.
Come on up.

931
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:47,603
Glad you're here.
I could use the break.

932
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:50,323
Working lunch. I'm on a roll.

933
01:26:52,731 --> 01:26:53,974
Yeah.

934
01:26:55,578 --> 01:26:57,203
Both you and I know what you did.

935
01:26:59,226 --> 01:27:02,096
Maybe we don't have enough to
put you away now, but eventually...

936
01:27:02,970 --> 01:27:04,880
...we'll find those bodies.

937
01:27:05,050 --> 01:27:06,545
We'll tie you to them...

938
01:27:06,714 --> 01:27:08,340
...and you're going away.

939
01:27:10,011 --> 01:27:13,523
In the meantime, I'd appreciate it if
you didn't come into town anymore.

940
01:27:14,811 --> 01:27:16,337
Makes people uncomfortable.

941
01:27:19,098 --> 01:27:21,465
You can do your shopping
in New London.

942
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:25,778
Did you hear what I said?

943
01:27:28,186 --> 01:27:30,772
Sure. No problem.

944
01:27:32,378 --> 01:27:33,785
You know...

945
01:27:34,523 --> 01:27:38,134
...the only thing that matters
is the ending.

946
01:27:38,426 --> 01:27:41,143
It's the most important part
of the story, the ending.

947
01:27:42,107 --> 01:27:43,536
And this one...

948
01:27:45,339 --> 01:27:46,964
...is very good.

949
01:27:49,818 --> 01:27:51,509
This one's perfect.

950
01:28:01,338 --> 01:28:03,957
"'I know I can do it, '
Todd Downey said...

951
01:28:04,122 --> 01:28:08,017
...helping himself to another ear
of corn from the steaming bowl.

952
01:28:08,827 --> 01:28:10,736
'I'm sure that in time...

953
01:28:11,259 --> 01:28:13,463
...every bit of her will be gone.

954
01:28:13,658 --> 01:28:16,625
And her death will be a mystery...

955
01:28:17,242 --> 01:28:18,736
...even to me. "'
