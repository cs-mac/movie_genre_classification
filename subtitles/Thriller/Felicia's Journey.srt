We do try.

00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,975
I've told you before, Sidney,
it starts with the stock.

Don't rely on cubes.

What's for dessert?
Raspberry jam
steamed pudding.

28
00:05:15,718 --> 00:05:19,653
I'd give it
a few minutes yet.
I'm afraid I've got a meeting.

29
00:05:19,655 --> 00:05:22,656

00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:28,095

<i>Morning, Mr. hilditch.</i>
Morning, Jimmy.

Morning.

Have you means

Identification?

What's your name?
Felicia.

36
00:05:42,678 --> 00:05:47,381
Do you have
a driver's license?
I can't drive.

37
00:05:47,383 --> 00:05:49,983
Have you any form
of identification?

38
00:05:49,985 --> 00:05:52,019
No, I can't think that I have.

39
00:05:52,021 --> 00:05:55,122
No letter?
No documentation
of any kind?

40
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,393
Could you step aside?

41
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:03,464
<i>Are you a resident

42

No, I'm from Ireland.

43
00:06:06,936 --> 00:06:09,670
<i>I'm here to see a friend.</i>

44
00:06:13,776 --> 00:06:16,377
<i>May I look</i>

<i>for a moment?</i>

45
00:06:36,432 --> 00:06:39,733
Every minute
I'll be thinking of you.

46
00:06:41,404 --> 00:06:44,405
Every minute
you'll be by my side.

<i>The coach to london/victoria,

49
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:23,510
Sorry. Excuse me.
Could you tell me where
the lawn mower factory is?

50
00:07:23,512 --> 00:07:25,646
Lawn mower factory?
Sorry.
Yeah.

51
00:07:25,648 --> 00:07:27,481
Okay, thanks.

52
00:07:30,686 --> 00:07:33,987
Excuse me. Could you
tell me where the
lawn mower factory is?

53
00:07:33,989 --> 00:07:37,624
Lawn mower factory, my dear?
No, sorry, can't help you.

54
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:39,827
Okay, thank you.

57
00:07:50,005 --> 00:07:55,108
<i>Hello. Could you give me the</i>
<i>phone number for the lawn mower</i>

58
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:59,680
<i>No. A place that makes them,
doesn't sell them.</i>

59
00:08:02,618 --> 00:08:07,921
By installing food machines,
you could dispense
with the canteen staff.

60
00:08:07,923 --> 00:08:11,124
The machines back directly
on to the kitchens
like this.

61
00:08:11,126 --> 00:08:13,861
The prepared portions load
straight in.

62
00:08:13,863 --> 00:08:17,564
And at a drop of a coin,
the dishes emerge when
and how they're required.

63
00:08:17,566 --> 00:08:20,067
What do you mean,
"how they're required"?

64
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:24,171
Piping hot or chilled
or anything in between.

65
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:27,174
Come in.

66
00:08:27,176 --> 00:08:29,543
<i>Here you are,
Mr. hilditch.</i>

67
00:08:30,946 --> 00:08:32,813
Fresh from the oven.

68
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,061
It's better, iris.
It's better.
Good show.

69
00:08:48,063 --> 00:08:51,031
Thank you, Mr. hilditch.

70
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:53,267
I'll let the others know.

71
00:08:59,241 --> 00:09:01,842
<i>It can serve drinks as well.</i>

72
00:09:01,844 --> 00:09:06,580
<i>Just load the machine</i>
<i>with tea, coffee,</i>
<i>chocolate, softs.</i>

73
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:09,616
No more than
ten minutes labor a day.
You can't lose.

74
00:09:09,618 --> 00:09:12,986
But I would lose, Ted.

75
00:09:12,988 --> 00:09:15,956
I would lose my staff.

76
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,927
I would lose the way iris
takes the bother...

77
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:24,031
To bring me up a dish of
raspberry jam steamed pudding.

78
00:09:26,168 --> 00:09:31,004
<i>Food must be served

81
00:09:36,345 --> 00:09:38,712
It makes us feel...

82
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:42,215
Loved!

83
00:09:43,786 --> 00:09:46,753
Can I keep this?

84
00:10:22,057 --> 00:10:24,157
Morning.

85
00:11:20,115 --> 00:11:23,050
Can I help you?
Is this where
they make lawn mowers?

86
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:24,951
I'm afraid not.

87
00:11:27,256 --> 00:11:29,790
Lawn mowers? Why?

88
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:32,859
<i>I have a friend who works
in a place that makes them.</i>

89
00:11:32,861 --> 00:11:34,961
The only thing is,
I'm not certain where it is.

90
00:11:34,963 --> 00:11:40,233
You could try
the black barrow
industrial estate.

91
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:44,471
<i>They've got</i>
<i>a garden center there.</i>
<i>They might know.</i>

92
00:11:44,473 --> 00:11:46,873
Go over the bridge,

93
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:51,311
turn right, and go
until you see the signs.

94
00:11:51,313 --> 00:11:53,380
<i>Okay?</i>

95
00:11:53,382 --> 00:11:55,716
<i>Good luck.</i>

96
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,507
Hello, sister.

97
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:24,845
Yes, I know Johnny lysaght.

98
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:29,382
And you went out
with him?
I did.

99
00:12:29,384 --> 00:12:33,220
You hear certain remarks made
about that boy, Felicia.

100
00:12:33,222 --> 00:12:35,255
I'm not saying it's gospel.

101
00:12:35,257 --> 00:12:39,526
All I'm saying is there are
certain statements made.

102
00:12:39,528 --> 00:12:42,796
What statements?
He joined
the British army.

103
00:12:45,801 --> 00:12:49,169
But Johnny
went to england because
he couldn't get work here.

104
00:12:49,171 --> 00:12:52,839
There's better boys than that
around here, Felicia.

105
00:12:52,841 --> 00:12:55,242
Irish boys belong in Ireland.

106
00:12:58,113 --> 00:13:01,982
Johnny's not in the army.
He works in a factory.

107
00:13:01,984 --> 00:13:03,817
Lawn mower parts.

108
00:13:08,323 --> 00:13:10,957
<i>How about you? Would I know

No, just me.
Yeah.
<i>No? Just you?</i>

110
00:13:14,396 --> 00:13:16,930
Just you and your father
and your mother?

111
00:13:16,932 --> 00:13:20,333
My mother passed away
when I was four.

112
00:13:20,335 --> 00:13:23,136
But there's my father
and my great-grandmother.

113
00:13:24,406 --> 00:13:26,873
She must be
a ripe old age.
<i>Yeah.</i>

114
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:31,144
She's about a hundred now.
<i>That's incredible.</i>

115
00:13:31,146 --> 00:13:34,881

00:16:33,395 --> 00:16:35,562
No.

154
00:16:35,564 --> 00:16:38,198
<i>I'm saying it now.</i>

155
00:16:44,606 --> 00:16:46,773
You look beautiful now.

00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:36,583
<i>bon.</i> Let me give you
an important piece of advice...

159
00:18:36,585 --> 00:18:39,152
About buying a good loin,

160
00:18:39,154 --> 00:18:42,689
or about buying anything
for that matter.

161
00:18:42,691 --> 00:18:47,393
The late
georges escoffier, one
of the greatest French chefs,

162
00:18:47,395 --> 00:18:52,665
says in his important book,
<i>le guide escoffier,</i>

163
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:55,602
is a matter of provisions.

164
00:18:55,604 --> 00:18:59,639
No matter what you buy...

165
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:03,443
The cheapest is always
the dearest in the end.

166
00:19:06,648 --> 00:19:10,183
<i>So, get your butcher...</i>

167
00:19:10,185 --> 00:19:13,453
<i>To chop well down
between each bone.</i>

168
00:19:13,455 --> 00:19:19,292
<i>And trim each chop</i>
<i>as for cutlets,</i>
<i>but do not separate.</i>

169
00:19:19,294 --> 00:19:22,595
<i>Roll the joints in the form
of a crown...</i>

170
00:19:22,597 --> 00:19:25,765
With the meat inside.

171
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:30,537
<i>Then attach them together.</i>

172
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,939
Take this needle.

173
00:19:32,941 --> 00:19:36,743
It's very scary, I know,
but it is so practical.

174
00:19:36,745 --> 00:19:39,812
You tie them together.

175
00:19:39,814 --> 00:19:42,849
<i>It's really fun to do too.</i>

176
00:19:42,851 --> 00:19:46,419
<i>There. Voila!</i>

177
00:19:46,421 --> 00:19:48,922
<i>The crown roast of lamb...</i>

178
00:19:48,924 --> 00:19:52,959
May be filled with
ordinary poultry stuffing...

179
00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:55,562
Or filled afterwards...

180
00:19:55,564 --> 00:19:59,399
With mashed potatoes
sprinkled with parsley.

181
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:02,235
Or, and this is my favorite,

182
00:20:02,237 --> 00:20:05,572
with pureed turnip and a pickle.

183
00:20:05,574 --> 00:20:09,976
And what better way to puree
your turnip and a pickle...

184
00:20:09,978 --> 00:20:14,314
Than by using
your new gala chef processor.

185
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:20,520
Let me tell you a few words
about your new processor.

186
00:20:20,522 --> 00:20:25,225
<i>It is amazing.</i>
<i>There are</i>
<i>all these possibilities.</i>

187
00:20:25,227 --> 00:20:29,295
<i>To add the right ingredients,
you can fold...</i>

188
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:57,557
This fresh Rosemary
will be the perfect garnish
for our lamb.

189
00:21:09,404 --> 00:21:13,606
Let's go inside and see
if the roast is ready.

190
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:18,044
<i>Isn't it perfect?
Last touches.</i>

191
00:21:18,046 --> 00:21:21,414
Now, let's put
these lovely little hats.

192
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,884
It makes it very festive,
you know.

193
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:30,657
<i>But also, it's fun
with kids around the table.</i>

194
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:34,894
<i>Sometimes they can</i>
<i>pick it up and fight</i>
<i>over it, etcetera.</i>

195
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:38,364
<i>Here we go.
I think we should taste.</i>

196
00:21:38,366 --> 00:21:41,467
Let's have a taste...

197
00:21:41,469 --> 00:21:44,070
And see how marvelous this is,
no question.

198
00:21:59,688 --> 00:22:01,721
<i>Delicieux.</i>

199
00:22:01,723 --> 00:22:03,790
<i>No surprise.</i>

200
00:23:46,461 --> 00:23:48,494
Listen to me, Felicia.

201
00:23:48,496 --> 00:23:50,730
You'll not live in our house...

202
00:23:50,732 --> 00:23:53,166
And keep company
with a member
of the British army.

203
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:58,971
This family knows
where it stands,
and always has done.

204
00:24:00,842 --> 00:24:03,509
Think of your
great-grandmother.

205
00:24:03,511 --> 00:24:07,513
Her husband, your blood,

206
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:11,717
was executed
by the brits,
may, 1960.

207
00:24:13,154 --> 00:24:17,457
Sacrifices have been made,
and they will be honored.

208
00:24:19,494 --> 00:24:21,928
We have a duty to remember
these things.

209
00:24:24,699 --> 00:24:27,867
Time will not allow us
to forget.

210
00:24:59,734 --> 00:25:03,503
This fellow will be back,
Felicia.

211
00:25:03,505 --> 00:25:07,073
But associate with him again,

212
00:25:07,075 --> 00:25:09,542
and you will leave our house.

213
00:25:15,717 --> 00:25:18,951
You're at the beginning
of things, Felicia.

214
00:25:18,953 --> 00:25:21,721
One of these days,
there'll be work for you.

215
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:28,060
Felicia,

216
00:25:28,062 --> 00:25:32,632
when you're a child,
you take advice.

217
00:25:32,634 --> 00:25:35,067
But I'm not a child, dad.

218
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:37,603
Not anymore.

219
00:25:40,174 --> 00:25:44,310
I've said what I have to say.
We can leave it.

220
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:20,680
You're goin' out, girl?

221
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:13,633
Morning.

222
00:27:13,635 --> 00:27:17,703
My wife and I
were worried about you.

223
00:27:17,705 --> 00:27:20,139
I was afraid you might
have left already.

224
00:27:20,141 --> 00:27:23,643
It seems that Thompson's casting
would be a waste of time.

225
00:27:25,146 --> 00:27:27,980
<i>But I've tracked down the place
you're looking for.</i>

226
00:27:27,982 --> 00:27:31,651
<i>It's about fifty Miles away.</i>

227
00:27:31,653 --> 00:27:35,388
A lot of people who live locally
make the journey every day.

228
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,657
No reason why
your friend wouldn't.

229
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:40,926
Ada's up there in the hospital.

230
00:27:42,397 --> 00:27:47,733
We had that phone call
last night,
see, about you.

231
00:27:48,703 --> 00:27:50,736
Ada's poorly.

232
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,007
<i>You see?</i>

233
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:58,811
<i>But what I wanted to tell you is
I've got to drive up that way...</i>

234
00:27:58,813 --> 00:28:02,314
Tomorrow morning,
on account of ada.

235
00:28:02,316 --> 00:28:07,053
What I'm saying is,
you'd be welcome to a seat
in our little jalopy.

236
00:28:09,424 --> 00:28:11,724
I don't think I...

237
00:28:11,726 --> 00:28:13,926
<i>No, naturally you wouldn't.</i>

238
00:28:13,928 --> 00:28:16,328
You probably want
to get up there today.

239
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:20,332
<i>Good luck.
Toodle-oo.</i>

240
00:28:24,806 --> 00:28:27,173
Could I have the lift?

241
00:28:30,244 --> 00:28:32,878
Of course!

242
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,316
It's 6:30 sharp, though,
on account of ada.

243
00:28:37,318 --> 00:28:41,487
But... I like to pop in
and catch her
before her morning tests.

244
00:28:41,489 --> 00:28:44,824
6:30's all right.

245
00:28:44,826 --> 00:28:47,793
<i>I'll pick you up
outside your b & b.</i>

246
00:28:47,795 --> 00:28:51,263
All right?
See you tomorrow.

247
00:29:00,742 --> 00:29:03,809
<i>It won't be long
till you're back again?</i>

248
00:29:03,811 --> 00:29:06,245
<i>No, it won't be long.</i>

249
00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:10,416
Can I write to you?

250
00:29:10,418 --> 00:29:13,052
I'm not much of a one
for letters.

251
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:17,990
Come here, look.

252
00:29:17,992 --> 00:29:21,527
Every minute, I'm gonna
be thinking about you.

253
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:24,363
And every minute,
you're gonna be
by my side, all right?

254
00:29:26,768 --> 00:29:28,534
I haven't got your address.

255
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:35,241
How are you doing?
Nice to see you.
How are you?

256
00:29:35,243 --> 00:29:37,843
Not too bad.
She's nice, isn't she?

257
00:29:37,845 --> 00:29:40,412
Yeah, not a bad bike.
Were you involved
the other night?

258
00:29:40,414 --> 00:29:43,149
<i>Me friend Greg, broken nose.</i>

259
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:46,185
Took some belt.
He did indeed.

260
00:29:46,187 --> 00:29:48,254
How are you keeping?
Yeah, I'm good.

261
00:29:48,256 --> 00:29:50,289
Good-lookin' belt.

262
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:53,058
<i>I'm back off to england.
England, for what?</i>

263
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,362
<i>Just back there.</i>
<i>Gotta go back to work.</i>
<i>How long have you had this?</i>

264
00:29:56,364 --> 00:29:58,998
<i>Three weeks now.</i>

265
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,333
<i>Don't kill yourself on it.
I won't.</i>

266
00:30:01,335 --> 00:30:03,903
<i>Be careful.
Yeah.</i>

267
00:30:08,176 --> 00:30:11,477
I remember giving you a go
on a bike before.

268
00:30:11,479 --> 00:30:13,913
Yeah, that's right.

269
00:30:13,915 --> 00:30:15,581
See you.

270
00:30:24,225 --> 00:30:27,092
He didn't see we wanted
to be alone.

271
00:30:27,094 --> 00:30:30,830
You didn't tell him.

272
00:30:33,201 --> 00:30:36,202
Your address.

273
00:30:36,204 --> 00:30:39,572
I'll send it to you.
First thing

I'm a friend of Johnny's,
Mrs. lysaght.
Yes?

277
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,274
I was wondering if you had
his address.

278
00:32:23,411 --> 00:32:26,011
What do you want with Johnny?

279
00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:30,416
Just to write him a letter,
Mrs. lysaght.

280
00:32:30,418 --> 00:32:35,054
My son wouldn't want
his address given out
to all and sundry.

281
00:32:35,056 --> 00:32:38,991
<i>He wouldn't mind you giving me
his address.</i>

282
00:32:38,993 --> 00:32:41,060
He didn't give it
to you himself then?

283
00:32:41,062 --> 00:32:44,029
<i>No, he said he'd send it.</i>

284
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:47,166
<i>I was wondering</i>
<i>if he sent it to you</i>
<i>to give me.</i>

00:32:49,704 --> 00:32:52,037
All I want to do is contact him.

286
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:55,174
You've had enough contact

00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:25,798
<i>Our days together
seem a long time ago.</i>

306
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,067
<i>I miss those days.</i>

307
00:34:30,471 --> 00:34:34,073
<i>Are you receiving these letters,
Johnny?</i>

308
00:34:34,075 --> 00:34:37,209
<i>Your mother said
she would send them on to you.</i>

309
00:34:37,211 --> 00:34:40,412
<i>I need to see you
as soon as I can.</i>

310
00:34:52,827 --> 00:34:55,661
<i>You seem like a nice person.</i>

311
00:34:55,663 --> 00:34:58,797
<i>I'm all right
once you get to know me.</i>

312
00:34:59,767 --> 00:35:02,134
<i>Are you married?</i>

313
00:35:02,136 --> 00:35:05,137
<i>It doesn't matter.
I was just asking.</i>

314
00:35:07,174 --> 00:35:10,742
<i>I'm not married, but I have
to look after my mother.</i>

315
00:35:13,114 --> 00:35:16,315
<i>She's getting old now.
Is she?</i>

316
00:35:16,317 --> 00:35:18,517
Are you the only person
she's got?

317
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:22,187
You are a nice man, then.

318
00:35:22,189 --> 00:35:26,225
<i>You haven't told me</i>
<i>anything about you,</i>
<i>how you think, how you feel.</i>

319
00:35:26,227 --> 00:35:31,430
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>if you've ever been married</i>
<i>or you've got children.</i>

320
00:35:31,432 --> 00:35:34,433
<i>You haven't told me
anything like that.</i>

321
00:35:34,434 --> 00:35:37,435
<i>I'm not saying</i>
<i>what we had wasn't special,</i>
<i>'cause it was.</i>

322
00:35:37,438 --> 00:35:39,471
<i>I probably</i>
<i>wouldn't be here now</i>
<i>if it weren't for you,</i>

323
00:35:39,473 --> 00:35:42,508
but you know,
things are different.

324
00:36:12,306 --> 00:36:16,275
Morning.
Well, here we are.

325
00:36:16,277 --> 00:36:19,378
Was it all right,
the b & b?
The what?

326
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:23,248
The bed and breakfast.
Yeah, it's fine.

327
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:27,519
I'm glad of that.
I wouldn't like to think
I'd misled you.

328
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,541
Has lysaght got you pregnant?

329
00:37:23,844 --> 00:37:26,245
We're both responsible.

330
00:37:28,015 --> 00:37:31,350
How long are you gone?

331
00:37:31,352 --> 00:37:33,518
I've missed a few times.

332
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:37,456
How many?

333
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:39,992
There's no doubt about it.

334
00:37:42,863 --> 00:37:45,364
Carrying the enemy within you.

335
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,968
Thank God your mother
isn't alive to see it.

336
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:53,939
You're a whore!

337
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:56,508
You're a whore!

338
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,877
And you're worse than that!

339
00:37:58,879 --> 00:38:01,346
Damn you to hell!

340
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:10,756
<i>The first time
i met up with you...</i>

341
00:38:10,758 --> 00:38:14,760
<i>I could see you were
in a bit of an upset.</i>

342
00:38:14,762 --> 00:38:19,798
<i>You're fond of the boyfriend,
are you?</i>

343
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,303
<i>It's not difficult to believe
that he's fond of you.</i>

344
00:38:25,939 --> 00:38:29,341
<i>I said,</i>
<i>it's not difficult to believe</i>
<i>that he's fond of you.</i>

345
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:33,578
I'm having his baby.

346
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,715
What?

347
00:38:37,851 --> 00:38:39,885
I'm pregnant.

348
00:38:50,964 --> 00:38:53,632
You're going to be a mother.

349
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,848
We'll see everyone
who arrives
from here.

350
00:39:46,987 --> 00:39:49,821
Going to get out
and look for him?
Yeah.

351
00:39:49,823 --> 00:39:51,690
Go on then.

352
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,674
<i>- May I help you?
- Is this where they make lawn mowers?</i>

353
00:40:09,676 --> 00:40:12,511
<i>We make lots of things here.</i>

354
00:40:12,513 --> 00:40:16,615
Do you know if
Johnny lysaght works here?
I've not heard of that name.

355
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:19,785
He's about that tall.
He's got blond hair.

356
00:40:19,787 --> 00:40:22,521
Let's just
check the register.
Okay.

357
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:14,506
<i>This fresh Rosemary</i>
<i>will be the perfect garnish</i>
<i>for our lamb.</i>

358
00:41:21,715 --> 00:41:25,817
So let's go inside
and see if the roast is ready.

359
00:41:27,788 --> 00:41:30,589
Cut!

360
00:41:30,591 --> 00:41:34,526
Joey was in the shot again.
I know!
Go sit there.

361
00:41:35,762 --> 00:41:37,996
Could we do
one more?
Yes, of course.

362
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:42,200
Next time, when you pick
the Rosemary, could you
really roll it in your hand?

363
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:58,643
No.
He doesn't work here.

364
00:43:09,623 --> 00:43:11,723
He said he loved me.

365
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:16,061
That we'd be together forever.

366
00:43:20,233 --> 00:43:23,602
Then he left
without giving me
his address.

367
00:43:26,173 --> 00:43:30,775
I need to find him!
His mother's trying
to keep him away from me.

368
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:33,612
Mothers can be difficult.

369
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:37,649
<i>I don't want
to bother you with it.</i>

370
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:44,222
Another person's trouble
can lift the mind.

371
00:43:44,224 --> 00:43:46,992
Do you understand me?

372
00:43:49,062 --> 00:43:52,030
Don't be ashamed.

373
00:43:52,032 --> 00:43:55,300
We understand exactly
how you feel.

374
00:43:55,302 --> 00:43:58,069
Exactly!

375
00:43:58,071 --> 00:44:00,338
We've had experience.

376
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:06,144
I'll drive you back...

377
00:44:06,146 --> 00:44:08,713
After I visit the hospital.

378
00:44:40,981 --> 00:44:43,715
I'll just pop in, dear.
Find out the state of play.

379
00:44:51,224 --> 00:44:54,826
I'm sorry.

380
00:44:54,828 --> 00:44:59,297
<i>I've got to stand on my own two feet.
Surely you must see that.</i>

381
00:44:59,299 --> 00:45:03,301
<i>I was weak before.</i>

382
00:45:03,303 --> 00:45:06,705
<i>You've helped me</i>
<i>strengthen everything</i>
<i>about my personality,</i>

383
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:11,076
<i>and I feel like I'm ready
to go it alone.</i>

384
00:45:11,078 --> 00:45:13,845
I'll always remember
the conversations we've had,

385
00:45:13,847 --> 00:45:17,248
and the way
you've helped me,
but... that's it now.

386
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:19,918
I'm not even a body,
I'm not even a person.

387
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,420
I'm just a part of a woman
that men want to use.

388
00:45:22,422 --> 00:45:26,057
I've got nowhere to go.

389
00:45:36,036 --> 00:45:39,971
Excuse me.
Could you tell me where
I might find the lavatory?

390
00:45:39,973 --> 00:45:43,808
Down there
on the left.
Thank you.

391
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:46,911
<i>You're fine.
You're not hurting.</i>

392
00:45:46,913 --> 00:45:49,447
<i>You're the strong one.
Why do you need me?</i>

393
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:51,783
<i>Why do you need my stories?</i>

394
00:45:51,785 --> 00:45:54,385
I needed you.
You don't need anybody.

395
00:45:54,387 --> 00:45:56,755
You've got your mum.

396
00:45:56,757 --> 00:45:59,958
You've helped me back
to myself, I'm all right now.
That's why I wanna go.

397
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,494
I can't get attached
to people
in my profession.

398
00:46:02,496 --> 00:46:05,764
You should be happier
for me.
Why aren't you?

399
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:07,966
<i>You've been wonderful.
I can't explain.</i>

400
00:46:07,968 --> 00:46:12,270
<i>And you've helped me get
to where I am now.</i>

401
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:16,775
<i>I've just got</i>
<i>this strength</i>
<i>and this spirit,</i>

402
00:46:16,777 --> 00:46:19,043
<i>and I just want more.</i>

403
00:46:19,045 --> 00:46:22,313
<i>I didn't want interviews.</i>
<i>I didn't want</i>
<i>all this crap.</i>

404
00:46:22,315 --> 00:46:24,349
<i>"Who are you?</i>
<i>What's your name?</i>
<i>What did you do?</i>

405
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:26,184
<i>Who's your boyfriend?</i>
<i>How did you get</i>
<i>into this situation?"</i>

406
00:46:26,186 --> 00:46:28,953
Hi, my name's gaye,
and I'm a prostitute.

407
00:46:28,955 --> 00:46:31,790
- My name's Sharon.
- Bobbi.
- My name's Beth.

408
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:33,958
- My name's jakki.
- Elsie.

409
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,296
You'll find other people
that you can relate to
the way you've related to me.

410
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:42,400
<i>You'll find other people</i>
<i>that you can connect with</i>
<i>and talk to...</i>

411
00:46:42,402 --> 00:46:44,836
<i>That are special to you.</i>

412
00:46:44,838 --> 00:46:48,006
<i>I guess I'm just
another ordinary person.</i>

413
00:46:48,008 --> 00:46:52,110
<i>There are lots of people</i>
<i>that would find</i>
<i>your personality endearing,</i>

414
00:46:52,112 --> 00:46:54,913
<i>and they would love
to speak to you.</i>

415
00:47:31,318 --> 00:47:35,253
I'd give half my kingdom now.

416
00:47:35,255 --> 00:47:39,924
<i>No. Give me the head
of the baptist.</i>

417
00:47:39,926 --> 00:47:45,096
Stop it.
Please don't do that.
It's really scary.

418
00:47:45,098 --> 00:47:49,133
I'd like to go back,
please.
Where are we now?

419
00:47:49,135 --> 00:47:52,036
Please can I go?
Will you just stop the car?

420
00:47:52,038 --> 00:47:54,606
<i>Please will you just
stop the car?</i>

421
00:47:54,608 --> 00:48:00,078
<i>I'd like to stop.</i>
<i>Don't just ignore me.</i>
<i>Will you say something?</i>

422
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,881
<i>What?</i>
<i>What is...</i>
<i>Wrong with you?</i>

423
00:48:05,085 --> 00:48:07,518
What's wrong with you?
Why don't you
just let me go?

424
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,889
I might see...
Just...

425
00:48:14,361 --> 00:48:18,463
My God!
Get off me!
Help me!

426
00:48:39,219 --> 00:48:41,219
<i>Cut!</i>

427
00:48:41,221 --> 00:48:43,254
How was that?
Fine.

428
00:48:43,256 --> 00:48:45,423
Should we do one with Joey?

429
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:48,126
Sure. We could have him
pluck some Rosemary,
then run to follow you inside.

430
00:48:48,128 --> 00:48:50,361
<i>Bon.</i>

431
00:49:22,195 --> 00:49:25,029
Is something wrong?

432
00:49:25,031 --> 00:49:28,499
Ada's not so good.

433
00:49:28,501 --> 00:49:32,704
They had to do
an emergency
at 5:00 this morning.

434
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,641
She's not so good.

435
00:49:38,178 --> 00:49:40,712
I'm sorry.

436
00:49:40,714 --> 00:49:43,114
I'll be all right in a minute.

437
00:49:46,386 --> 00:49:51,222
You get a shock like this,
you don't want to be alone.

438
00:49:51,224 --> 00:49:55,226
Both of us with a shock,
Felicia.

439
00:49:59,299 --> 00:50:04,302
I'm glad you're going
to have a baby, Felicia.

440
00:50:04,304 --> 00:50:07,205
It's a help to me, that.

441
00:50:08,575 --> 00:50:10,742
A help?

442
00:50:12,278 --> 00:50:15,113
Another life coming.

443
00:50:16,516 --> 00:50:22,420
Ada going in
at this particular time,
and you here.

444
00:50:22,422 --> 00:50:25,656
And ada concerned about you...

445
00:50:25,658 --> 00:50:28,126
When I told her.

446
00:50:31,631 --> 00:50:35,333
"Young Irish girl," I said.

447
00:50:37,203 --> 00:50:39,804
She wanted to know
what you looked like.

448
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:44,108
I told her you were
going to be a mother.

449
00:50:45,645 --> 00:50:48,780
I hope you don't mind.

450
00:50:50,283 --> 00:50:54,585
I thought it might
give her a lift.

451
00:50:54,587 --> 00:50:57,355
We never had kids of our own.

452
00:50:59,292 --> 00:51:01,559
Yes, you told me.

453
00:51:03,229 --> 00:51:05,696
A great disappointment.

454
00:51:07,133 --> 00:51:10,735
A child is a blessing, Felicia.

455
00:51:10,737 --> 00:51:13,738
Never forget that.

456
00:51:17,177 --> 00:51:19,277
A blessing.

457
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:54,645
Are you thinking
of having the thing terminated,
Felicia?

458
00:51:54,647 --> 00:51:57,181
What?

459
00:51:57,183 --> 00:52:01,452
Do they have that over there?
Abortion?

460
00:52:01,454 --> 00:52:03,454
Where?

461
00:52:03,456 --> 00:52:06,891
Ireland.

462
00:52:06,893 --> 00:52:09,393
<i>There's difficulties.</i>

463
00:52:09,395 --> 00:52:13,731
Difficulties.
Of course.

464
00:52:13,733 --> 00:52:16,634
We'll make our way back,
shall we?

465
00:53:09,322 --> 00:53:11,522
My father...
Yes?

466
00:53:14,794 --> 00:53:17,695
My father says...

467
00:53:17,697 --> 00:53:20,631
Johnny joined the army
over here.

468
00:53:22,202 --> 00:53:26,204
It can't be true.
Of course not.

469
00:53:26,206 --> 00:53:29,840
Johnny wouldn't lie
to me.
No!

470
00:53:29,842 --> 00:53:32,310
<i>Johnny wouldn't lie to you.</i>

471
00:53:32,312 --> 00:53:35,213
<i>He wouldn't join the army
over here.</i>

472
00:53:35,215 --> 00:53:37,782
<i>Come inside.
We'll make some inquiries.</i>

473
00:53:37,784 --> 00:53:41,519
<i>The girl I have at the office</i>
<i>is very good</i>
<i>at tracking things down.</i>

474
00:53:41,521 --> 00:53:45,957
I'm sorry.
I can't be a nuisance
at a time like this.

475
00:53:58,871 --> 00:54:02,373
Never a nuisance, Felicia.

476
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:04,575
Never.

477
00:54:29,502 --> 00:54:31,502
I don't want nothing.

478
00:54:31,504 --> 00:54:34,872
Of course you don't.
Course not, honey.

479
00:54:34,874 --> 00:54:39,744
Today I have brought
the Bible to you.
I don't want no Bible!

480
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,007
This is the paradise earth.

481
00:55:10,009 --> 00:55:14,345
This is the promise
and the place
of the father lord.

482
00:55:14,347 --> 00:55:17,715
You hear of the flood?
Noah and his ark?
You hear of that?

483
00:55:17,717 --> 00:55:21,986
Yes, I have.
Child, we live
in a miracle!

484
00:55:21,988 --> 00:55:24,789
Look here at this garden, honey.

485
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:29,460
The father lord
is gathering all things in.

486
00:55:29,462 --> 00:55:32,530
I have to get a room
for the night.

487
00:55:32,532 --> 00:55:36,767
<i>I can offer you a room.
No charge made.</i>

488
00:55:38,438 --> 00:55:43,507
What I'm doing now
is pinching the Turkey...

489
00:55:43,509 --> 00:55:46,077
<i>So that I can loosen...</i>

490
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:50,414
Who's making inquiries about this soldier?
I'm a friend of the family.

491
00:55:50,416 --> 00:55:53,484
I'm afraid there's been
an emergency.

492
00:55:53,486 --> 00:55:56,921
<i>The young man's father's
had an accident.</i>

493
00:55:56,923 --> 00:56:02,426
What are you asking me?
Well, the family's uncertain...

494
00:56:02,428 --> 00:56:05,529
Which barracks
the lad's stationed at,

495
00:56:05,531 --> 00:56:08,366
owing to his father
being unconscious in hospital.

496
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:11,902
<i>We're ringing round</i>
<i>all the barracks</i>
<i>in the area.</i>

497
00:56:11,904 --> 00:56:15,506
<i>Name and rank?
Lysaght, j.</i>

498
00:56:17,477 --> 00:56:19,477
A squaddie, I would say.

499
00:56:19,479 --> 00:56:22,613
A what?
A private.

500
00:56:25,618 --> 00:56:28,686
We have a lysaght here.

501
00:56:28,688 --> 00:56:30,755
Wonderful.

502
00:56:30,757 --> 00:56:34,725
We'll pass the message on
after fatigues.
No.

503
00:56:34,727 --> 00:56:38,896
It would be better
if the family
brought the news to him.

504
00:56:38,898 --> 00:56:44,402
Now we know where he is,
we'll, contact him pronto.

505
00:56:45,738 --> 00:56:47,738
Thank you.

506
00:56:50,643 --> 00:56:52,977
<i>Now, this fine young man...</i>

507
00:56:52,979 --> 00:56:56,747
<i>Will help me demonstrate
a novel way...</i>

508
00:56:56,749 --> 00:56:59,617
Of stuffing your Turkey
without untrussing it...

509
00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:01,819
And then trussing it
back together again.

510
00:57:01,821 --> 00:57:04,755
No, no, no.
Too complicated.

511
00:57:04,757 --> 00:57:09,960
I take the stuffing
and fit it into...

512
00:57:09,962 --> 00:57:13,497
<i>A nylon icing bag...</i>

513
00:57:13,499 --> 00:57:16,534
<i>With no pipe affixed, of course.</i>

514
00:57:17,904 --> 00:57:21,005
<i>Like this.
Fill it up.</i>

515
00:57:25,812 --> 00:57:30,147
Now, go in.
<i>Et voila.</i>

516
00:57:31,717 --> 00:57:35,453
Now, Joey, why don't you
show everyone...

517
00:57:35,455 --> 00:57:38,489
How easy this is.

518
00:57:38,491 --> 00:57:41,058
You just squeeze it...

519
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:44,595
Until the bird is full.

520
00:57:44,597 --> 00:57:49,099
Joey!
What a mess you made!

521
00:57:49,101 --> 00:57:53,637
Here is a piece of liver
that managed to escape.
Open your mouth, Joey.

522
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:58,709
<i>Joey!
Open your mouth!</i>

523
00:57:58,711 --> 00:58:02,780
It's very good for you,
the liver.

524
00:58:02,782 --> 00:58:05,216
<i>Liver is a delicacy.</i>

525
00:58:07,086 --> 00:58:09,253
Go get the towel
to help mama clean up.

526
00:58:09,255 --> 00:58:12,656
What a mess,

527
00:58:12,658 --> 00:58:14,492
Joey.

528
00:58:30,543 --> 00:58:32,843
<i>One, one, one, one.</i>

529
00:58:32,845 --> 00:58:35,246
One, one, one, one.

530
00:58:49,996 --> 00:58:53,030
<i>One, one, one, one.</i>

531
00:59:01,841 --> 00:59:03,707
Johnny!

532
00:59:15,922 --> 00:59:18,889
It's quiet
in the gathering house
this time of day.

533
00:59:18,891 --> 00:59:21,859
Each and every one
is out and about.

534
00:59:21,861 --> 00:59:24,795
Do a lot of people
live here?
Black and white, child.

535
00:59:24,797 --> 00:59:28,933
Young and old.
All that are called
to gather in.

536
00:59:45,318 --> 00:59:48,218
<i>You are not amongst us
by chance,</i>

537
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:50,654
<i>for there is nothing
that can happen...</i>

538
00:59:50,656 --> 00:59:53,657
But by the commandment
that began...

539
00:59:53,659 --> 00:59:56,627
In the garden of pleasure.

540
00:59:56,629 --> 01:00:01,298
Adam was taken
from out of the ground
of the paradise earth,

541
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,634
<i>and the commandment...</i>

542
01:00:03,636 --> 01:00:07,905
<i>Was drawn in the dust.</i>

543
01:00:07,907 --> 01:00:10,107
<i>Look close.</i>

544
01:00:10,109 --> 01:00:13,043
<i>See the serpent spit.</i>

545
01:01:06,065 --> 01:01:08,065
<i>Where did you find this?</i>

546
01:01:08,067 --> 01:01:12,970
She was quite a sensation
back then, wasn't she?

547
01:01:12,972 --> 01:01:15,305
Gave fannie craddock
a run for her money.

548
01:01:15,307 --> 01:01:17,808
<i>Not that I understood
a word she said.</i>

549
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:21,812
<i>What was the name
of her little boy?</i>

550
01:01:21,814 --> 01:01:25,749
<i>Jimmy?
Does it say?</i>

551
01:01:28,054 --> 01:01:29,887
Here it is.

552
01:01:31,891 --> 01:01:34,458
Joey.

553
01:03:11,023 --> 01:03:12,422
What is it, child?

554
01:03:12,424 --> 01:03:14,992
I've lost some money.
Money?

555
01:03:14,994 --> 01:03:17,928
It was in my bag.
What you saying to me,
child?

556
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:21,331
I had money with my clothes.
It was hidden away in my bag
and it's been taken.

557
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:24,268
Not in this house.
Never that, child.
It's missing.

558
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:27,971
Stolen!
You're saying stolen.

559
01:03:27,973 --> 01:03:30,574
No, not at all.

560
01:03:30,576 --> 01:03:33,143
Only, I left the bag
when I first came in.

561
01:03:33,145 --> 01:03:36,880
<i>We provide you with shelter
and true belief,</i>

562
01:03:36,882 --> 01:03:39,049
and now there is accusation?

563
01:03:39,051 --> 01:03:43,153
I didn't say it was stolen.
I just want it back.
I've no money now.

564
01:03:43,155 --> 01:03:46,356
You're asking for money, child?

565
01:03:46,358 --> 01:03:50,194
<i>No. I'm sorry</i>
<i>to wake you. There's been</i>
<i>a terrible confusion.</i>

566
01:03:50,196 --> 01:03:52,863
The child has lost some money.

567
01:03:52,865 --> 01:03:55,866
If one of you might
have seen it... maybe
I took it out by mistake,

568
01:03:55,868 --> 01:03:59,837
or it slipped out
of the bag.
She says it has been stolen!

569
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,855
<i>Are you working?
I say, are you working?</i>

570
01:04:17,857 --> 01:04:21,525
Give me a special price.

571
01:04:36,442 --> 01:04:38,275
Are you working?

572
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:42,179
Suit yourself.

573
01:04:50,322 --> 01:04:53,924
<i>Nowhere to settle, dear?</i>

574
01:04:59,031 --> 01:05:02,566
<i>Come.
Keep me company.</i>

575
01:05:31,063 --> 01:05:33,964
We meet again.

576
01:05:33,966 --> 01:05:37,467
No luck with your searchings?

577
01:05:37,469 --> 01:05:40,537
You're soaking wet.
Come in, come in.

578
01:05:40,539 --> 01:05:42,539
Give me your bag.

579
01:05:42,541 --> 01:05:47,210
Look at you.
Go through.
It's warm in there.

580
01:05:47,212 --> 01:05:51,381
<i>Yesterday, you said,
could you help me that day.</i>

581
01:05:51,383 --> 01:05:53,216
<i>And I was wondering...</i>

582
01:05:57,623 --> 01:06:01,558
I was wondering
if you could lend me
the fare to go home.

583
01:06:14,306 --> 01:06:16,273
You want to go back?

584
01:06:18,677 --> 01:06:21,411
It was a mistake comin' here.

585
01:06:21,413 --> 01:06:24,381
I shouldn't ever have come over.

586
01:06:28,153 --> 01:06:31,254
What about your friend,
though? Sit down.

587
01:06:33,425 --> 01:06:37,260
I'll never find him.

588
01:06:37,262 --> 01:06:40,030
You can't give up, Felicia.

589
01:06:40,032 --> 01:06:43,133
Not this easily.

590
01:06:43,135 --> 01:06:47,237
If your friend knew
all this, he'd be doing
his nut with worry.

591
01:06:47,239 --> 01:06:50,607
I've had experience of this.

592
01:06:50,609 --> 01:06:54,378
If he knew what
you've been going through,

593
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:58,181
looking for him
in a country
that's so strange to you,

594
01:06:58,183 --> 01:07:00,550
poor fellow would be
beside himself.

595
01:07:00,552 --> 01:07:03,353
I want to find Johnny.

596
01:07:03,355 --> 01:07:06,490
And that's what we'll do.

597
01:07:06,492 --> 01:07:09,559
I'll ask the girl
at the office
to ring round,

598
01:07:09,561 --> 01:07:11,561
like I suggested.

599
01:07:11,563 --> 01:07:15,532
You remember
I suggested that, Felicia,
before you...

600
01:07:15,534 --> 01:07:19,169
I'm so sorry.
I...

601
01:07:19,171 --> 01:07:22,406
No, no. It's completely
understandable,

602
01:07:22,408 --> 01:07:25,642
you scuttling off like that.

603
01:07:25,644 --> 01:07:30,213
I passed that incident on
to ada...

604
01:07:30,215 --> 01:07:33,683
When she had a bright moment.

605
01:07:33,685 --> 01:07:36,386
She said it was understandable.

606
01:07:36,388 --> 01:07:39,523
Hmph.
I only mention it...

607
01:07:39,525 --> 01:07:45,062
'Cause I wouldn't
like you to think there
was any offense taken.

608
01:07:45,064 --> 01:07:47,230
Is your wife getting better?

609
01:07:52,704 --> 01:07:54,738
Ada died, dear.

610
01:07:57,376 --> 01:07:59,376
God, I...

611
01:07:59,378 --> 01:08:01,678
I'm sorry.

612
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,181
This morning.

613
01:08:05,384 --> 01:08:07,484
I've just got home.

614
01:08:12,257 --> 01:08:17,360
As a matter of fact,
we have to say
it was a blessed release.

615
01:08:17,362 --> 01:08:21,665
<i>We have to use
that expression, Felicia.</i>

616
01:08:23,235 --> 01:08:27,571
You need something to eat.
Come to the kitchen.

617
01:08:32,644 --> 01:08:35,378
There's a place I've heard of...

618
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:39,649
Where the Irish boys
meet up of an evening.

619
01:08:39,651 --> 01:08:43,353
It's called the barton arms.

620
01:08:43,355 --> 01:08:46,656
Have you checked out
the barton arms at all?

621
01:08:46,658 --> 01:08:49,326
It's a pub.

622
01:08:52,297 --> 01:08:55,198
I have high hopes
of the barton arms.

623
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,801
I've a feeling in my bones.

624
01:09:27,599 --> 01:09:32,369
Tell you the truth,
it'd give me a lift
to go out.

625
01:09:57,663 --> 01:10:01,665
No go, dear?
No?

626
01:10:01,667 --> 01:10:05,535
They aren't even Irish.

627
01:10:05,537 --> 01:10:08,371
Happen the Irish lads
come in later.

628
01:10:08,373 --> 01:10:10,874
We'll give it 20 minutes,

629
01:10:10,876 --> 01:10:13,210
Come on, sit down.

630
01:10:14,813 --> 01:10:18,848
Bear with me a minute,
Felicia.
It's just occurred to me,

631
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:21,985
I know a bloke
who employs Irish labor.

632
01:10:21,987 --> 01:10:25,388
He's a manager
of a smelting works
about a mile off.

633
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:27,857
I'll give him a ring.
I'll get us some drinks
as well.

634
01:10:27,859 --> 01:10:30,760
Did you want
a cup of tea?
Won't be a minute.

635
01:10:32,965 --> 01:10:35,999
As many flowers
as are available.

636
01:10:36,001 --> 01:10:40,570
As long as they can
be delivered immediately.
Yes, tonight.

637
01:10:40,572 --> 01:10:45,375
Right. Yes. Well,
I'll leave the selection
up to you.

638
01:10:45,377 --> 01:10:47,444
Yes, it's a funeral.

639
01:10:53,652 --> 01:10:55,986
No dice.

640
01:11:02,661 --> 01:11:05,295
Out for the evening seemingly.

641
01:11:10,002 --> 01:11:12,602
We'll move on, shall we?

642
01:11:23,515 --> 01:11:27,550
But...
We haven't had
our drinks yet.

643
01:11:47,839 --> 01:11:52,642
I hope it's not
a presumption on my part,
Felicia,

644
01:11:52,644 --> 01:11:56,680
but, have you considered
your condition at all?

645
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:00,784
<i>It's only I'm thinking,</i>

646
01:12:00,786 --> 01:12:04,587
<i>whatever the outcome
of tracking Johnny down is,</i>

647
01:12:04,589 --> 01:12:07,791
you don't want
to let yourself get caught.

648
01:12:09,494 --> 01:12:12,896
<i>"Don't let it go too far,"</i>

649
01:12:12,898 --> 01:12:15,999
was always ada's advice.

650
01:12:16,001 --> 01:12:18,535
<i>And my own as well.</i>

651
01:12:18,537 --> 01:12:21,571
<i>Enough to say, you've lost it.</i>

652
01:12:21,573 --> 01:12:24,507
I don't want to do
a thing like that.

653
01:12:24,509 --> 01:12:27,043
<i>Now, now.</i>

654
01:12:27,045 --> 01:12:32,048
<i>Drink some of that tea
while it's warm.</i>

655
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:35,051
The goodness is
in the warmth, they say.

656
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:54,104
I only mention it because...

657
01:12:54,106 --> 01:12:56,906
Ada mentioned it
before she went.

658
01:12:58,677 --> 01:13:01,711
But you're right.
It's best left for now.

659
01:13:01,713 --> 01:13:06,049
<i>I'll get the girl</i>
<i>in my office</i>
<i>to make her inquiries...</i>

660
01:13:06,051 --> 01:13:09,586
<i>First thing</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>
She won't find him.

661
01:13:09,588 --> 01:13:13,456
<i>If anyone can find</i>
<i>your friend,</i>
<i>that girl can.</i>

662
01:13:13,458 --> 01:13:15,658
<i>By tomorrow,</i>

663
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:18,862
we'll have master Johnny
in our sights.

664
01:14:22,527 --> 01:14:25,495
I'll come back in a few days.

665
01:14:25,497 --> 01:14:27,764
A few days?

666
01:14:27,766 --> 01:14:30,834
What are you talking about,
Felicia?

667
01:14:30,836 --> 01:14:33,736
I forgot about the funeral.

668
01:14:33,738 --> 01:14:37,140
Listen, dear.

669
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:44,047
Army life taught me
something very important.

670
01:14:44,049 --> 01:14:46,983
You carry on.

671
01:14:46,985 --> 01:14:50,620
Chin up, and march forward.

672
01:14:52,924 --> 01:14:56,493
As far as Johnny
is concerned,
by tomorrow night...

673
01:14:56,495 --> 01:15:00,263
We'll know the score.

674
01:15:00,265 --> 01:15:05,869
I'll come back
tomorrow night, then.
Any time after dark.

675
01:15:05,871 --> 01:15:10,874
You'll find
somewhere tonight,
will ya?
I'll manage.

676
01:15:10,876 --> 01:15:13,543
You all right
in the toilet department
before you set off?

677
01:15:13,545 --> 01:15:15,812
Yes, all right, thanks.

678
01:15:17,616 --> 01:15:21,851
You're welcome, of course,
to lay your head down here.

679
01:15:24,189 --> 01:15:27,757
<i>I'll get you a blanket,</i>
<i>shall I?</i>
Yes, please.

680
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:39,102
<i>My favorite thing
was to run a bath,</i>

681
01:15:39,104 --> 01:15:42,038
<i>you know,</i>
<i>like a bubble bath</i>
<i>and have scent.</i>

682
01:15:44,209 --> 01:15:47,544
<i>Candles all around.</i>

683
01:15:47,546 --> 01:15:51,281
<i>I'd walk around in her robe
while it was running.</i>

684
01:15:51,283 --> 01:15:53,583
<i>And then I'd just sink away.</i>

685
01:15:57,155 --> 01:16:00,089
And then, when I'd finished,

686
01:16:00,091 --> 01:16:03,927
if I had time
I'd go into their room...

687
01:16:03,929 --> 01:16:06,996
And I'd dress up in her clothes.

688
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:13,836
<i>Pretend that I was needed...</i>

689
01:16:13,838 --> 01:16:17,206
<i>And wanted,
not just for my body...</i>

690
01:16:17,208 --> 01:16:19,242
<i>But for me.</i>

691
01:16:21,913 --> 01:16:25,882
<i>For who I was
and what I could do.</i>

692
01:16:25,884 --> 01:16:28,785
<i>That was my little fantasy.</i>

693
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:43,926
Morning.

694
01:17:48,099 --> 01:17:51,834
Now, you will stay
in the house,
won't you, dear?

695
01:17:51,836 --> 01:17:55,672
We don't want the neighbors
to get ideas
so soon after ada.

696
01:17:55,674 --> 01:17:57,874
Well, you know.

697
01:17:57,876 --> 01:18:02,745
No answering the door,
no phone calls.

698
01:18:04,783 --> 01:18:07,950
I'll be back
around 6:00.

699
01:18:19,297 --> 01:18:22,298
<i>Bye.</i>
I dreamt
that you met Johnny.

700
01:18:26,137 --> 01:18:29,806
That you knew where he was.

701
01:18:29,808 --> 01:18:34,343
With any luck, Felicia,
that dream might come true.

702
01:18:34,345 --> 01:18:38,247
Let's see what my girl
turns up with,

703
01:18:38,249 --> 01:18:43,720
<i>I'll pray for her.</i>
Who?

704
01:18:43,722 --> 01:18:46,422
Your wife.

705
01:18:50,161 --> 01:18:51,327
Thank you, Felicia.

706
01:18:56,101 --> 01:18:58,067
<i>Morning, Mr. hilditch.</i>

707
01:18:58,069 --> 01:19:01,771
Morning, Jimmy.
Better spot of weather,

708
01:19:01,773 --> 01:19:05,074
Does your heart good,
Mr. hilditch. What do
we have for lunch today?

709
01:19:05,076 --> 01:19:08,444
Rissoles in batter, or pork.

710
01:19:08,446 --> 01:19:10,813
How was the COD
yesterday?
Tiptop.

711
01:19:10,815 --> 01:19:12,849
I'm glad to hear it, Jimmy.

712
01:19:12,851 --> 01:19:14,817
Morning, iris.
Good morning.

713
01:19:14,819 --> 01:19:17,086
Smells champion, that pork.

714
01:19:17,088 --> 01:19:20,056
Mr. hilditch?
What is it?

715
01:19:20,058 --> 01:19:25,328
Double sausage roll.
Won't you try it?

716
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:28,464
Yes.

717
01:19:28,466 --> 01:19:31,934
That's a beautiful tie
you're wearing, Mr. hilditch.

718
01:19:31,936 --> 01:19:36,205
I've not seen you in black.

719
01:19:36,207 --> 01:19:38,207
Did you not like...

720
01:19:38,209 --> 01:19:41,077
<i>Morning.</i>

721
01:19:41,079 --> 01:19:44,013
Morning!
Hello.

722
01:19:57,228 --> 01:19:59,395
<i>I had an abortion
six months ago.</i>

723
01:19:59,397 --> 01:20:01,964
<i>I had to get rid of it.</i>

724
01:20:01,966 --> 01:20:05,134
<i>And it had to be quick.</i>
<i>I couldn't think,</i>
<i>I couldn't breathe,</i>

725
01:20:05,136 --> 01:20:10,273
<i>because every day</i>
<i>it was growing inside me,</i>
<i>and it was becoming...</i>

726
01:20:10,275 --> 01:20:12,441
<i>It was becoming a person,
and I just...</i>

727
01:20:12,443 --> 01:20:15,812
It made me feel ill.
I didn't want it.

728
01:20:15,814 --> 01:20:18,414
It reminded me of what I did.

729
01:20:18,416 --> 01:20:20,917
What I do.

730
01:20:20,919 --> 01:20:23,152
So I had to go private.

731
01:20:23,154 --> 01:20:26,122
<i>I looked in the phone book.
I found a clinic.</i>

732
01:20:26,124 --> 01:20:29,992
<i>Nice place.
The gishford in sheffield.</i>

733
01:20:29,994 --> 01:20:33,162
<i>The staff were really nice.</i>
<i>Friendly.</i>
<i>Didn't ask many questions.</i>

734
01:20:33,164 --> 01:20:38,000
An immediate
would be wonderful.
Yes!

735
01:20:38,002 --> 01:20:41,871
Right. Thank you.
Thank you
for fitting her in.

736
01:20:41,873 --> 01:20:45,074
Thank you.
Bye.

737
01:21:16,274 --> 01:21:18,875
<i>Johnny's different.</i>

738
01:21:18,877 --> 01:21:20,910
<i>He'd want our baby.</i>

739
01:21:20,912 --> 01:21:23,646
And you came here
to ascertain that.

740
01:21:23,648 --> 01:21:27,550
To make sure.
Is that right, Felicia?

741
01:21:30,989 --> 01:21:33,623
But you never got an answer.

742
01:21:33,625 --> 01:21:36,893
You have to look at it
like that.

743
01:21:36,895 --> 01:21:40,162
If the girl in the office
had struck lucky today,

744
01:21:40,164 --> 01:21:43,032
then it would've been
a different kettle of fish.

745
01:21:43,034 --> 01:21:45,601
I'm not saying it wouldn't.

746
01:21:45,603 --> 01:21:48,204
But she didn't.

747
01:21:48,206 --> 01:21:51,574
And I'm definitely
of one mind with you now.

748
01:21:53,645 --> 01:21:55,544
We won't find Johnny.

749
01:21:59,417 --> 01:22:03,953
Johnny'll be over
St. Patrick's day,
or easter.

750
01:22:03,955 --> 01:22:07,556
I was thinkin' about that
the entire day.

751
01:22:07,558 --> 01:22:10,660
It'll be all right
when I'm there,
and we're together again.

752
01:22:10,662 --> 01:22:13,496
There's no doubt
that Johnny loves you,
dear.

753
01:22:13,498 --> 01:22:15,965
<i>Nothing you've said to me
contradicts that.</i>

754
01:22:15,967 --> 01:22:19,435
No.

755
01:22:19,437 --> 01:22:22,305
The point I'm trying
to make to you is...

756
01:22:24,642 --> 01:22:29,545
The situation,
like you and Johnny are in,

757
01:22:31,683 --> 01:22:36,619
could all too easily
be affected by misfortune.

758
01:22:40,224 --> 01:22:43,726
Ada said that, Felicia.

759
01:22:43,728 --> 01:22:48,564
Ada had a considerable insight
into matters of the heart.

760
01:22:56,274 --> 01:23:01,010
The thing is, Felicia,
you're over here now.

761
01:23:01,012 --> 01:23:03,212
This isn't Ireland.

762
01:23:03,214 --> 01:23:09,051
And we have
certain facilities available.

763
01:23:09,053 --> 01:23:11,754
What I'm saying to you...

764
01:23:11,756 --> 01:23:16,759
<i>Is what I'd say</i>
<i>to any daughter</i>
<i>ada and myself might have had.</i>

765
01:23:16,761 --> 01:23:20,730
<i>I'm giving you the benefit
of long experience.</i>

766
01:23:20,732 --> 01:23:25,468
<i>There isn't a doubt
in my mind, Felicia.</i>

767
01:23:25,470 --> 01:23:30,306
<i>I've thought of nothing else</i>
<i>since I rested poor ada</i>
<i>in the ground.</i>

768
01:23:32,777 --> 01:23:35,711
There's some
would call it murder.

769
01:23:43,054 --> 01:23:44,320
Murder?

770
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:51,527
We're not in this world
to cause pain, dear.

771
01:23:53,297 --> 01:23:58,701
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>you have to think</i>
<i>of yourself on occasion.</i>

772
01:23:58,703 --> 01:24:03,072
I'm not saying you don't.

773
01:24:03,074 --> 01:24:06,809
But there are other people too,

774
01:24:06,811 --> 01:24:10,813
which is something
you're daily more aware of
as you grow older.

775
01:24:10,815 --> 01:24:14,316
What are you talking about?

776
01:24:14,318 --> 01:24:16,652
<i>No one's denying</i>
<i>you've been through it,</i>
<i>Felicia.</i>

777
01:24:16,654 --> 01:24:21,590
But so has your dad,
and your great gran.

778
01:24:23,361 --> 01:24:27,363
<i>Imagine them trying
to hold their heads up.</i>

779
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:33,235
<i>There's that to think about too.</i>

780
01:24:34,472 --> 01:24:38,641
We all have to do
terrible things, Felicia.

781
01:24:40,478 --> 01:24:43,312
We have to find
the courage sometimes.

782
01:24:45,349 --> 01:24:48,751
You're a young girl.

783
01:24:48,753 --> 01:24:52,254
When you find Johnny again,

784
01:24:52,256 --> 01:24:55,825
you can both make the choice...

785
01:24:55,827 --> 01:24:58,094
To have a child.

786
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:07,536
<i>But the circumstances
have to be right.</i>

787
01:25:07,538 --> 01:25:09,772
<i>A child...</i>

788
01:25:09,774 --> 01:25:15,277
Needs to be surrounded
by all the love it can.

789
01:25:17,315 --> 01:25:19,148
The love of the mother.

790
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:24,186
<i>Of course he'll have that.</i>

791
01:25:24,188 --> 01:25:27,223
<i>But the love of the father,</i>

792
01:25:27,225 --> 01:25:30,192
<i>and the grandfather,</i>

793
01:25:30,194 --> 01:25:32,828
<i>and the
great great-grandmother...</i>

794
01:25:34,499 --> 01:25:38,167
<i>Why deprive this baby of that?</i>

795
01:25:41,372 --> 01:25:44,673
I've, um...

796
01:25:44,675 --> 01:25:47,676
I've put by a little
that I'd gladly donate...

797
01:25:47,678 --> 01:25:50,779
In order to do the decent thing
by your family.

798
01:25:53,251 --> 01:25:56,886
Anything you lend me,
I'll send back.

799
01:25:56,888 --> 01:25:58,921
Every penny.

800
01:25:58,923 --> 01:26:01,390
I've no doubt, Felicia.

801
01:26:04,462 --> 01:26:06,729
They can do an immediate
at the gishford.

802
01:26:06,731 --> 01:26:09,632
A what?

803
01:26:11,736 --> 01:26:13,903
It's a clinic.

804
01:26:13,905 --> 01:26:17,206
They can do it at once.

805
01:26:17,208 --> 01:26:21,744
I asked the girl
to put a call in to them.

806
01:26:21,746 --> 01:26:24,446
You could be back
across the water by Monday.

807
01:26:24,448 --> 01:26:28,250
<i>Back a free spirit, Felicia,</i>

808
01:26:28,252 --> 01:26:30,519
<i>with the whole thing...</i>

809
01:26:30,521 --> 01:26:34,490
<i>Lifted from you.</i>

810
01:26:34,492 --> 01:26:37,560
It's what's right, Felicia,
believe me.

811
01:26:37,562 --> 01:26:40,629
It's what's meant.

Come on, then.
Put your coat on.

823
01:28:22,066 --> 01:28:25,901
Yeah.
That's it.

824
01:28:25,903 --> 01:28:28,804
Come on, let's get you home.

825
01:28:30,841 --> 01:28:33,742
Thank you.
We're very much obliged.

826
01:28:33,744 --> 01:28:35,811
<i>See she keeps nice and warm.</i>

827
01:28:35,813 --> 01:28:38,847
We've a little journey,
they I'll tuck her up.

828
01:28:38,849 --> 01:28:40,716
Just a minute.

829
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:46,088
Doctor said
she wasn't sleeping too well.

830
01:28:46,090 --> 01:28:49,491
Thank you.

831
01:28:56,901 --> 01:29:00,936
Come on, dear.
Take it easy.

832
01:29:00,938 --> 01:29:04,606
We'll have you home in a jiffy.

833
01:31:12,470 --> 01:31:14,670
I'll go in the morning.

834
01:31:14,672 --> 01:31:17,573
<i>Yes.</i>

835
01:31:17,575 --> 01:31:20,175
Forty-two pounds.

836
01:31:20,177 --> 01:31:22,978
If I could borrow that.

837
01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:26,248
<i>I doubt if that's
sufficient, dear.</i>

838
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:30,085
One little mishap...
It's terrible to be short.

839
01:31:30,087 --> 01:31:34,790
You've had experience
yourself, of course.

840
01:31:34,792 --> 01:31:38,260
I'll send every penny back.

841
01:31:38,262 --> 01:31:41,530
And every penny it cost today.

842
01:31:41,532 --> 01:31:44,600
Today was my treat, dear.

843
01:31:44,602 --> 01:31:47,803
I was happy about today.

844
01:31:47,805 --> 01:31:50,539
Ada would've liked today.

845
01:31:53,277 --> 01:31:57,546
But you're in no state
to travel, of course.

846
01:31:57,548 --> 01:32:00,616
I have to go.

847
01:32:00,618 --> 01:32:04,720
You weren't at all well
in the car, dear.

848
01:32:04,722 --> 01:32:09,558
You certainly can't set off
on a journey
in this condition.

849
01:32:11,896 --> 01:32:14,730
I shouldn't have done it.

850
01:32:14,732 --> 01:32:17,799
What's done is done, dear.

851
01:32:17,801 --> 01:32:21,303
No one ever grew rich
on regrets.

852
01:32:21,305 --> 01:32:24,273
What about the bright side,

853
01:32:27,077 --> 01:32:30,746
For as long as
you want it, Felicia,

854
01:32:30,748 --> 01:32:33,749
there's a welcome
at number three.

855
01:32:33,751 --> 01:32:37,319
You have your own
little room now.

856
01:32:37,321 --> 01:32:41,089
The sensible thing would be
if we took it day by day.

857
01:32:41,091 --> 01:32:42,925
I had dreams.

858
01:32:46,196 --> 01:32:49,965
The whole time it was happening,

859
01:32:49,967 --> 01:32:51,800
I had dreams.

860
01:32:54,238 --> 01:32:57,673
I dreamt that I saw him,

861
01:32:57,675 --> 01:33:00,609
Johnny and me...

862
01:33:00,611 --> 01:33:02,811
Walking with our little boy.

863
01:33:02,813 --> 01:33:04,846
<i>A boy, was it?</i>

864
01:33:10,321 --> 01:33:13,088
I often remember being a boy.

865
01:33:15,593 --> 01:33:17,726
Drink up your cocoa, dear.

866
01:33:20,598 --> 01:33:24,666
<i>I'm sorry if
I'm fatherly, Felicia.</i>

867
01:33:24,668 --> 01:33:27,636
<i>I can't help being fatherly.</i>

868
01:33:29,073 --> 01:33:31,373
<i>I've grown fond of you.</i>

869
01:33:31,375 --> 01:33:35,210
The first time I saw you,

870
01:33:35,212 --> 01:33:39,314
you were there with your bag,

871
01:33:39,316 --> 01:33:42,317
woebegone and bedraggled.

872
01:33:42,319 --> 01:33:44,920
You were different
from the rest.

873
01:33:44,922 --> 01:33:47,389
What rest?

874
01:33:50,761 --> 01:33:52,794
The others.

875
01:33:54,965 --> 01:33:56,798
Beth.

876
01:33:58,035 --> 01:34:01,169
Elsie.

877
01:34:01,171 --> 01:34:03,005
Sharon.

878
01:34:04,208 --> 01:34:07,309
<i>Gaye.</i>

879
01:34:07,311 --> 01:34:09,878
<i>Bobbi.</i>

880
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:11,947
<i>Jakki.</i>

881
01:34:11,949 --> 01:34:13,782
Samantha.

882
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:19,988
All on their own journeys.

883
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:21,823
Lost girls.

884
01:34:24,361 --> 01:34:26,895
I was the world to them.

885
01:34:29,299 --> 01:34:32,300
In their time of need,

886
01:34:32,302 --> 01:34:35,437
they counted on me.

887
01:34:37,007 --> 01:34:42,077
But then they wanted to go.
Just like you.

888
01:34:42,079 --> 01:34:47,349
<i>But none of them
ever came into this house.</i>

889
01:34:47,351 --> 01:34:49,785
<i>It was never that.</i>

890
01:34:49,787 --> 01:34:53,055
Then...
What was there?

891
01:34:58,762 --> 01:35:02,064
A chat in the car.

892
01:35:02,066 --> 01:35:04,132
I like the chats.

893
01:35:05,335 --> 01:35:07,402
Then... sleep.

894
01:35:09,306 --> 01:35:12,040
They were always asleep
when it happened, Felicia.

895
01:35:13,744 --> 01:35:17,279
<i>When I laid them</i>
<i>to rest.</i>
No.

896
01:35:17,281 --> 01:35:20,115
Shh.

897
01:35:20,117 --> 01:35:22,184
Shh.

898
01:35:24,388 --> 01:35:28,256
I couldn't lay you
to rest, dear.

899
01:35:28,258 --> 01:35:32,494
Not until you'd taken care
of your little one.

900
01:35:32,496 --> 01:35:35,731
I couldn't do that
myself, Felicia.

Good afternoon, sir.

914
01:37:27,411 --> 01:37:30,111
Thank you for welcoming us.

915
01:37:30,113 --> 01:37:33,882
Today we bring you the word
of our father lord.

916
01:37:33,884 --> 01:37:36,218
I myself am from Jamaica,

917
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:38,620
and this is miss marcia tibbits.

918
01:37:38,622 --> 01:37:41,223
<i>May I inquire, sir,</i>

919
01:37:41,225 --> 01:37:44,092
<i>if you are familiar
with the writings of the Bible?</i>

920
01:37:44,094 --> 01:37:46,127
I'm afraid I'm not interested.

921
01:37:46,129 --> 01:37:48,530
<i>If we could just step
inside your home,</i>

922
01:37:48,532 --> 01:37:51,499
<i>my friend would offer you
her own experiences,</i>

923
01:37:51,501 --> 01:37:55,003
<i>how she was gathered in.</i>

924
01:37:55,005 --> 01:37:58,173
Ten minutes of your day
is not much sacrifice
to make.

925
01:37:58,175 --> 01:38:01,343
The father lord
gives us time eternal.

926
01:38:01,345 --> 01:38:04,446
We live in a miracle, sir.

927
01:38:04,448 --> 01:38:07,883
There is a future
for the one who dies.

928
01:38:07,885 --> 01:38:11,353
Look at this garden, sir.

929
01:38:11,355 --> 01:38:13,321
<i>You see the fruits of the trees,</i>

930
01:38:13,323 --> 01:38:17,292
and the people of all nations?

931
01:38:17,294 --> 01:38:21,263
Look. No iron bars
are needed, sir,

932
01:38:21,265 --> 01:38:26,902
for all the animals
are at peace
with the happy people.

933
01:38:26,904 --> 01:38:31,373
<i>Look at these</i>
<i>brightly colored birds</i>
<i>as they flit here and there.</i>

934
01:38:31,375 --> 01:38:35,911
<i>Imagine their beautiful song,
and the children's laughter...</i>

935
01:38:35,913 --> 01:38:38,580
Filling the air.

936
01:38:38,582 --> 01:38:41,182
Look, sir, as the father lord...

937
01:38:41,184 --> 01:38:45,053
Is gathering all things in.

938
01:38:47,591 --> 01:38:51,593
Look here, I'm busy.
I've things to do.

939
01:38:54,097 --> 01:38:56,598
An Irish girl
mentioned you, sir.

940
01:38:56,600 --> 01:39:02,270
<i>I remember that now
as we stand here.</i>

941
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:05,540
<i>"A good man," the girl said.
A helpmate to her.</i>

942
01:39:07,344 --> 01:39:12,247
"Duke of Wellington road,"
she said.

943
01:39:12,249 --> 01:39:16,117
Big and bighearted
was maybe the description.

944
01:39:17,254 --> 01:39:20,055
She said you seemed troubled.

945
01:39:20,057 --> 01:39:24,092
Troubled?

946
01:39:24,094 --> 01:39:26,461
I know no Irish people at all.

947
01:39:26,463 --> 01:39:30,365
<i>The girl make a song and dance
that she is stolen from.</i>

948
01:39:30,367 --> 01:39:34,135
Nothing better
than a common thief.

949
01:39:37,441 --> 01:39:42,377
Soon, the folk will come
from all over...

950
01:39:42,379 --> 01:39:45,213
For our prayer jubilee.

951
01:39:45,215 --> 01:39:49,617
May I ask you, sir,
if you have rooms
going spare in your house?

952
01:39:49,619 --> 01:39:54,089
Rooms?
What are you talking about?

953
01:39:54,091 --> 01:39:56,758
Sir, the folk come to rejoice.

954
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:00,295
For the future is written
in the writing of certainty.

955
01:40:00,297 --> 01:40:03,465
There will be fruit for all
heavy on the trees.

956
01:40:03,467 --> 01:40:06,301
And the green hills
stretch to the horizon.

957
01:40:06,303 --> 01:40:10,271
And the corn is lifted
from the land.

958
01:40:10,273 --> 01:40:13,641
See the foxes, sir,
tamed in their holes,

959
01:40:13,643 --> 01:40:17,512
and the geese happy
in the farmyard barn.

960
01:40:17,514 --> 01:40:20,081
Hear the cries
of the children at play,

961
01:40:20,083 --> 01:40:24,019
and the voices
raised in song
for the father lord.

962
01:40:24,021 --> 01:40:29,324
That is the promise.
That is the future
for the one who dies.

963
01:40:29,326 --> 01:40:32,327
None of us can flee
the one who dies,

964
01:40:32,329 --> 01:40:35,196
for the one who dies
awaits us...

965
01:40:35,198 --> 01:40:37,532
For when we, too,
have been cleansed,

966
01:40:37,534 --> 01:40:41,469
and are ready
for the paradise earth.

967
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:47,609
<i>There is a solace
for the troubled, sir.</i>

968
01:40:47,611 --> 01:40:51,546
What's she doing?
What's she writing down?

969
01:40:51,548 --> 01:40:53,581
This is a private house,
you know.

970
01:40:53,583 --> 01:40:56,184
What is written, sir,
is the address.

971
01:40:56,186 --> 01:40:59,087
<i>Three Duke of Wellington.</i>

972
01:40:59,089 --> 01:41:03,691
<i>And the number of folk</i>
<i>you have room for when</i>
<i>the jubilee is at hand.</i>

973
01:41:03,693 --> 01:41:06,728
<i>Sir, with the folk around you,</i>

974
01:41:06,730 --> 01:41:10,365
<i>you will soon discover
a heartsease.</i>

975
01:41:10,367 --> 01:41:13,301
<i>We understand
your troubles, sir.</i>

976
01:41:13,303 --> 01:41:17,405
<i>- We have put two and two together.
- What two and two?</i>

977
01:41:17,407 --> 01:41:20,608
<i>The Irish girl brought pain</i>
<i>to our people, sir,</i>
<i>as she has to you.</i>

978
01:41:20,610 --> 01:41:24,712
<i>You helped that girl on her way.</i>

979
01:41:24,714 --> 01:41:28,283
<i>You did not pass by
on the other side.</i>

980
01:41:28,285 --> 01:41:32,821
<i>Sir, you are at one
with our church.</i>

981
01:41:32,823 --> 01:41:37,158
<i>Sorry, I must get on.
This is not my kind of thing.</i>

982
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:40,495
<i>The girl was chattering.
It came out like that.</i>

983
01:41:40,497 --> 01:41:43,231
<i>A confidence trickster,
it turns out.</i>

984
01:41:43,233 --> 01:41:46,668
Sh-she asked me
the way.

985
01:41:46,670 --> 01:41:51,539
We would've shown her
the way, sir, as we
can show you right now!

986
01:41:53,844 --> 01:41:57,479
Parthians, and medes...

987
01:41:57,481 --> 01:41:59,514
And elamites!
Lord!

988
01:41:59,516 --> 01:42:02,784
And the dwellers
in mesopotamia,
and in judea.

989
01:42:02,786 --> 01:42:06,621
We hear them.
Some from their gardens.

990
01:42:06,623 --> 01:42:09,624
Some from the deserts.

991
01:42:09,626 --> 01:42:12,794
<i>We give you thanks.</i>
Get up from the ground.

992
01:42:12,796 --> 01:42:15,630
<i>We offer thanks!</i>
For God's sake, get up!

993
01:42:15,632 --> 01:42:18,633
Put that girl
out of your mind, sir.

994
01:42:18,635 --> 01:42:20,635
The pain will wash away.

995
01:42:20,637 --> 01:42:24,906
I'm not in pain.
I don't know what you mean
by pain.

996
01:42:24,908 --> 01:42:26,808
The healing will commence.

997
01:42:28,678 --> 01:42:30,645
I'm a catering manager.

998
01:42:30,647 --> 01:42:35,316
I have lived in this house
all my days.

999
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:39,687
I'm a respectable man.

1000
01:42:39,689 --> 01:42:41,689
Hilditch I am called.

1001
01:42:41,691 --> 01:42:45,193
We have come to gather you,
Mr. hilditch,

1002
01:42:45,195 --> 01:42:50,665
<i>as we come every day</i>
<i>to the houses</i>
<i>of the other folk.</i>

1003
01:42:50,667 --> 01:42:56,237
<i>Mr. hilditch, we are
concerned for you.</i>

1004
01:42:56,239 --> 01:42:59,240
Why not kneel down with us, sir?

1005
01:42:59,242 --> 01:43:02,777
Why not permit us
to ask for guidance?

1006
01:43:02,779 --> 01:43:08,316
We mention the girl to you
only to compliment you
on your charity.

1007
01:43:08,318 --> 01:43:11,419
You are not yourself, sir.

1008
01:43:11,421 --> 01:43:14,722
I have seen that,
and have said it.

1009
01:43:19,829 --> 01:43:21,729
I took that girl's money.

1010
01:43:23,633 --> 01:43:26,201
To keep her by me.

1011
01:43:30,473 --> 01:43:32,874
I am the thief.

1012
01:43:36,947 --> 01:43:38,980
No.

1013
01:43:41,384 --> 01:43:44,219
No, no.

1014
01:43:56,633 --> 01:44:00,235
I am lonely sometimes...

1015
01:44:00,237 --> 01:44:02,303
In my house.

1016
01:44:17,654 --> 01:44:20,421
Often.

1017
01:44:20,423 --> 01:44:22,924
I am lonely.

1018
01:45:12,442 --> 01:45:14,575
<i>You talked about me.</i>

1019
01:45:15,745 --> 01:45:17,845
To others.

1020
01:45:19,683 --> 01:45:22,617
You told them...

1021
01:45:22,619 --> 01:45:24,452
I was troubled.

1022
01:45:28,458 --> 01:45:33,828
You said this
to complete strangers.

1023
01:45:33,830 --> 01:45:36,898
I'm sorry if I upset you.

1024
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:39,467
I didn't mean to upset you.

1025
01:45:42,405 --> 01:45:46,674
No one's blaming you, dear.

1026
01:45:48,611 --> 01:45:52,347
Things... happen.

1027
01:45:53,450 --> 01:45:57,652
Things... take a turn.

1028
01:46:05,395 --> 01:46:07,495
We live in a miracle.

1029
01:46:10,967 --> 01:46:14,669
That's the promise.

1030
01:46:14,671 --> 01:46:16,738
That's the future.

1031
01:46:28,752 --> 01:46:31,686
<i>The pain...</i>

1032
01:46:33,022 --> 01:46:35,590
Will wash away.

1033
01:46:43,066 --> 01:46:45,633
The healing...

1034
01:46:46,903 --> 01:46:49,670
Will commence.
