1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
25.000 English

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,400
The Mark of Zorro (1940)

3
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,400
"MADRID - when the Spanish Empire
encompassed the globe, and young blades

4
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,400
were taught the fine
and fashionable art of killing..."

5
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:43,246
Fair seat, bad hands,
mount not sufficiently schooled.

6
00:01:50,853 --> 00:01:52,366
Disqualified.

7
00:01:52,453 --> 00:01:55,331
Here comes the California cockerel
Ten pesos he clears 'em all.

8
00:01:55,413 --> 00:01:57,404
Cleanly? Taken.

9
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:01,724
Grow wings, my friend.

10
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:12,925
Ten pesos, if you please.

11
00:02:13,013 --> 00:02:17,484
Maybe you've forgotten that in California
they use horses for cradles.

12
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:22,285
- Well done, senor. Excellent.
- And all I did was sit on his back.

13
00:02:22,373 --> 00:02:25,365
Three carrots after his oats tonight.

14
00:02:28,613 --> 00:02:32,811
- You go to an affair of the court?
- No, of the heart.

15
00:02:35,173 --> 00:02:39,086
- Something is wrong.
- The face, man. The face...

16
00:02:39,173 --> 00:02:40,891
Why the fine feathers?

17
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:43,885
A senorita that would put St Anthony
on the griddle. We're to meet in...

18
00:02:43,973 --> 00:02:48,967
Have you forgotten that you cross swords
with Lieutenant Cortez at three o'clock?

19
00:02:49,053 --> 00:02:51,442
It slipped my mind.

20
00:02:53,613 --> 00:02:56,252
Why do I have to meet
every swordsman in Madrid?

21
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,484
Everybody enjoys a certain amount of
fighting, but why do they all pick on me?

22
00:02:59,573 --> 00:03:03,612
Calm yourself. It's become a distinction
to assail a California cockerel.

23
00:03:03,693 --> 00:03:07,845
You pink them slightly in the arm or shoulder
and they boast of having met you.

24
00:03:09,253 --> 00:03:14,043
Cadet Vega, the commandant wishes
to see you in his office at once.

25
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:18,649
Good. I can't possibly fight the fellow now.
Explain that to him, will you?

26
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:21,725
And tell him I'll meet him tomorrow.

27
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:41,369
Senores, your attention, please.

28
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:44,286
I'm buying wine for all.

29
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:47,604
Come on.
It's your last chance to fill up on me.

30
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:50,127
Last chance?
What do you mean?

31
00:03:50,213 --> 00:03:55,446
My father has ordered me home.
I sail on the first ship from Lisbon.

32
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:58,411
To California?
But what about your commission here?

33
00:03:58,493 --> 00:04:00,768
I'll have to give that up.

34
00:04:00,853 --> 00:04:04,448
What's it like in California?
Are the Indians troublesome?

35
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:06,922
- Then who is there to fight?
- No one.

36
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:11,052
Then what will you do with
this spur of yours, my cockerel?

37
00:04:13,693 --> 00:04:15,684
This...

38
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,449
Leave it there.

39
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:24,808
And when you see it,
think of me,

40
00:04:24,893 --> 00:04:31,048
in a land of gentle missions, happy peons,
sleepy caballeros, and everlasting boredom.

41
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:33,124
Wine.

42
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:39,088
A toast.

43
00:04:39,173 --> 00:04:42,245
To California,
where a man can only marry,

44
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,370
raise fat children,
and watch his vineyards grow.

45
00:05:05,693 --> 00:05:11,051
- Are the vineyards bearing well this season?
- By some miracle the grapes remain sweet.

46
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:16,127
- Why so gloomy, my friend?
- People can't sing with hatred in their hearts.

47
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:21,333
- Hatred for whom?
- The alcalde. May his soul burn in hell.

48
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:25,008
The alcalde?
A kinder, better man never lived.

49
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:27,049
You don't know him.

50
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:30,125
I should know him.
He's my father.

51
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:37,689
I said it, and I won't deny it. I've taken
20 lashes before for a slip of the tongue.

52
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:42,565
Row, row.
Get me to shore.

53
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:57,531
- I'm honoured. How can I serve you?
- A glass of your best wine.

54
00:06:18,093 --> 00:06:22,245
- You are a stranger in these parts?
- No, not exactly.

55
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,893
I was born and raised not far from here.

56
00:06:24,973 --> 00:06:27,771
I am the son of the alcalde.

57
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,087
Where can I get a carriage
to drive me to Los Angeles?

58
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:48,926
Well, wake up.
Didn't you hear me?

59
00:06:49,013 --> 00:06:51,004
This way.

60
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:59,843
Pedro, here is a caballero who would
employ you. He is the son of the alcalde.

61
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:03,608
I want to be driven to Los Angeles.
I have some boxes and a portmanteau.

62
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:06,363
I'll pay you well.

63
00:07:06,453 --> 00:07:08,921
Stop staring at me.
Will you drive me or not?

64
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:12,922
What's come over this country?
Have you all gone mad?

65
00:07:13,013 --> 00:07:16,972
Listen, you.
Find speech, or I'll cut out your tongue.

66
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:20,932
Please. You are too late.
Your good father has already attended to that.

67
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:22,492
My father?
What are you talking about?

68
00:07:22,573 --> 00:07:28,125
I'm sorry, but at a meeting of the peons,
this man spoke against the heavy taxes.

69
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:33,810
The next day, the soldiers of His Excellency
cut out his tongue. I swear it is true.

70
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:34,652
Therefore, until we receive
the reinforcements promised us...

71
00:08:45,653 --> 00:08:50,329
So people can still laugh in California.
I'd begun to think they'd lost the habit.

72
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:52,973
- Your name?
- He claims to be the son of the alcalde.

73
00:08:53,053 --> 00:08:57,569
I claim nothing. I am Diego Vega,
son of His Excellency, Don Alejandro.

74
00:08:57,653 --> 00:09:00,884
And this, although I find it
greatly changed, is my home.

75
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,329
Your pardon, Don Diego. I'd not heard
of your returning. Welcome to California.

76
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:07,769
I'm Capitán Esteban Pasquale,
military aid to the alcalde.

77
00:09:07,853 --> 00:09:10,367
I'm honoured, but bewildered.

78
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:14,241
Why has my father turned
his home into a barracks?

79
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:20,090
Conditions have changed since you left.
Your father resigned. Age, you know.

80
00:09:20,173 --> 00:09:23,848
Since then, the peons have
become more industrious.

81
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:27,767
As to the caballeros, they're
encouraged to think of their own affairs.

82
00:09:27,853 --> 00:09:29,730
We take care of the government.

83
00:09:32,053 --> 00:09:34,442
I see.

84
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:39,766
- Tell me, who holds the office now?
- Don Luis Quintero. I'll take you to him.

85
00:09:39,853 --> 00:09:42,367
Thank you, but I should like to see
my family as quickly as possible.

86
00:09:42,453 --> 00:09:44,444
- Where are they living?
- At your old hacienda.

87
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:47,650
But His Excellency'll never forgive me if I let
you go without a word of welcome from him.

88
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:50,964
I'm quite sure
that you'll save me a reprimand.

89
00:09:51,053 --> 00:09:54,204
How could I refuse a man anything
with a naked sword in his hand?

90
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:59,242
So a wit has come to Los Angeles.
Carry out your orders, Sergeant.

91
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:02,602
Foolish habit of mine.

92
00:10:02,693 --> 00:10:06,402
Some men play with a glove,
or a monocle, or a snuffbox.

93
00:10:06,493 --> 00:10:10,452
Churchmen finger their beads.
I toy with a sword.

94
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:13,001
Do you fancy the weapon?

95
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:19,282
I know very little about it, my dear capitán.
Swordplay is such a violent business.

96
00:10:28,653 --> 00:10:32,805
So, this is the bird that killed
the black-breasted red?

97
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:35,043
Was it a bloody battle?

98
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:39,445
At the side of the pit,
all the people were covered with blood.

99
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:43,242
Pity I missed it.
What are you asking for him?

100
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:49,363
This is a noble bird. Well tested.
I'm asking 40 pesos for him.

101
00:10:49,453 --> 00:10:53,241
40 pesos? Esteban, this cheating dog
should have his taxes raised.

102
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,689
Oh, no, Your Excellency.
The bird is yours, as a gift.

103
00:10:56,773 --> 00:11:01,722
- Not one centimo will he cost you.
- That's a better attitude. Much better.

104
00:11:01,813 --> 00:11:04,611
Turn him over to my handlers.

105
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:14,284
And what caballero is this?
Or is he some young lord from Spain?

106
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,807
A good guess, Excellency.
He's just from Spain.

107
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:21,011
This is Don Diego Vega,
son of your respected predecessor.

108
00:11:21,093 --> 00:11:24,722
I thought such fabric came from Madrid.
Must have cost you plenty, eh?

109
00:11:24,813 --> 00:11:28,931
The caballero is here for words of welcome,
not to discuss the price of his clothes.

110
00:11:29,013 --> 00:11:31,288
Of course.
To be sure.

111
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:36,163
Welcome back, young sir.
Regard this house as still your home.

112
00:11:36,253 --> 00:11:39,450
Luis, a ship has arrived from Spain.

113
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,172
The shops will have something
worth looking at at last. I need...

114
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:44,528
Money.
It's always money.

115
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:46,968
I don't know this caballero.

116
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:49,965
- He's just off your precious ship from Spain.
- How delightful.

117
00:11:50,053 --> 00:11:52,931
Will one of you ill-mannered boors
present him?

118
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:55,402
Don Diego Vega.
Senora Inez de Quintero.

119
00:11:55,493 --> 00:11:57,961
My wife.

120
00:11:58,053 --> 00:12:00,283
Your Excellency is a very fortunate man.

121
00:12:00,373 --> 00:12:03,843
I'm not so sure.
She thinks pesos grow on mulberry trees.

122
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:07,323
Your husband was also fascinated
by the caballero's clothes.

123
00:12:07,413 --> 00:12:10,007
Your pardon.
We're overwhelmed by the latest fashions.

124
00:12:10,093 --> 00:12:13,881
And no wonder.
What is there here to interest a woman?

125
00:12:14,813 --> 00:12:19,250
I long for the life you've been leading.
The gaiety and splendour of the court.

126
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:24,532
- Patience, my love. You'll see it all someday.
- Doubtless, when I'm an old hag.

127
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:27,764
That catastrophe could never overtake you.

128
00:12:27,853 --> 00:12:32,290
Did you hear? How easily
he makes pretty speeches.

129
00:12:32,373 --> 00:12:34,125
I regret that...

130
00:12:43,093 --> 00:12:45,971
You were saying?

131
00:12:46,053 --> 00:12:48,487
I was saying that I must tear myself away

132
00:12:48,573 --> 00:12:51,133
and make some speeches
to my father and mother.

133
00:12:51,213 --> 00:12:53,966
Don't leave me to these barbarians.

134
00:12:54,053 --> 00:12:57,443
Come to the shops with me
and help me make my selections.

135
00:12:57,533 --> 00:13:00,889
Oh, you tempt me.

136
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,642
I love the shimmer of satin and silk,

137
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:08,248
the matching of one delicate shade
against the other.

138
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,370
Then there's the choosing
of scents and lotions -

139
00:13:11,453 --> 00:13:16,652
attar of rose, carnation,
crushed lily, and musk.

140
00:13:19,013 --> 00:13:23,768
- As for ornaments and jewels...
- But Don Diego must see his parents.

141
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:27,528
Too true.
Duty rather than pleasure.

142
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:34,127
I'll see you to the door.

143
00:13:43,413 --> 00:13:46,962
That's one little peacock
that won't give us any trouble.

144
00:13:47,053 --> 00:13:49,442
You think not?

145
00:13:51,093 --> 00:13:56,121
The capitán is jealous. The fop has
pricked the fencing master. Touché.

146
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:04,361
I don't like such jests.
Your eye might fail you.

147
00:14:04,453 --> 00:14:06,648
It's possible.

148
00:14:20,573 --> 00:14:23,133
- Who was that?
- No one you know.

149
00:14:23,213 --> 00:14:28,492
- Someone new. Very charming.
- He must be, from the colour in your cheeks.

150
00:14:28,573 --> 00:14:32,009
At last, after all these months
in this dreary place,

151
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:36,530
someone who knows the newest fashions,
the latest dances, how to flatter a woman.

152
00:14:36,613 --> 00:14:39,173
- When can I meet him?
- Listen to the child.

153
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:44,043
You're much too young to cope with his sort.
Why do you allow her to wear that mantilla?

154
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,363
It makes her look like a woman grown.

155
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:49,729
I am a woman grown.
I'll be 18 my next birthday.

156
00:14:49,813 --> 00:14:53,567
Carmen Castellano
is a month younger and already wed.

157
00:14:53,653 --> 00:14:57,566
Her grandmother was a peon.
Such riffraff wed when they like.

158
00:14:57,653 --> 00:15:01,202
You have the blood
of the hidalgos in your veins.

159
00:15:01,293 --> 00:15:05,127
Keep it cool, my girl,
or I'll whisk you into a convent.

160
00:15:12,973 --> 00:15:16,204
I pity your poor mount, Sergeant.
Such a heavy whip.

161
00:15:16,293 --> 00:15:21,492
Do you think I'd strike a good mare with this?
It would ruin her, break her spirit.

162
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,972
See? She didn't flick an ear.

163
00:15:26,053 --> 00:15:30,285
She knows. We are collecting
taxes from the peons today.

164
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:35,170
And you use that little switch
on the taxpayers?

165
00:15:35,253 --> 00:15:37,483
Only when they are stubborn.

166
00:15:39,053 --> 00:15:43,331
When you come to collect my taxes,
I won't be stubborn, I promise you.

167
00:15:43,413 --> 00:15:44,812
Turn right in here.

168
00:15:55,253 --> 00:15:57,050
Mother.

169
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:02,532
- My son. My baby.
- Mother.

170
00:16:02,613 --> 00:16:04,808
Hello, María.

171
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:08,771
Good old Juan, fat as ever.

172
00:16:08,853 --> 00:16:11,447
Hello, Manuel. And José.
Where's Father?

173
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:15,287
In the study with Fray Felipe.
Come, he's longing to see you.

174
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:18,171
Take Don Diego's things to his room.

175
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:22,726
I tell you,
these conditions are beyond bearing.

176
00:16:22,813 --> 00:16:26,806
This whole district, from the hills
of Verdugo to the shores of Del Rey,

177
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:28,849
is a stench in the nostrils of heaven.

178
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:31,367
- I know.
- You know, yes.

179
00:16:31,453 --> 00:16:34,843
- But what do you do about it? Nothing.
- What can...

180
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:38,603
Father.

181
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,443
My boy.

182
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,649
Padre.

183
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:45,963
Welcome back to your home and my heart.

184
00:16:46,053 --> 00:16:50,205
- I've missed your wise counsel.
- Not too greatly, I suspect.

185
00:16:50,293 --> 00:16:53,365
You remember Don Miguel and Don José?

186
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,210
- Have you returned to steal more melons?
- Melons?

187
00:16:57,293 --> 00:17:00,410
This scamp and my scapegrace son
crept into my garden

188
00:17:00,493 --> 00:17:03,610
and gorged themselves
on my seed melons one year.

189
00:17:03,693 --> 00:17:08,972
But God punished us. We were visited
by the father of all bellyaches.

190
00:17:09,053 --> 00:17:12,523
But he's ripe for more
than boyish pranks now.

191
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:16,765
- I feel good muscle here.
- Arms, muscle... You men.

192
00:17:16,853 --> 00:17:21,051
Is he without a face? Can't you see he's
even better-looking than when he left?

193
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:23,806
You should have seen me when I approached
the Spanish throne for the first time.

194
00:17:23,893 --> 00:17:26,566
They said I looked like a frightened gopher.

195
00:17:26,653 --> 00:17:28,644
More like a young angel, I'm sure.

196
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:33,853
An angel. That's what we need in California
now. An angel with a flaming sword.

197
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:36,811
Please, don't start that.
He didn't come home to get himself killed.

198
00:17:36,893 --> 00:17:42,411
Hold your tongue. Go to your women.
Leave my son to me. Sit down, Diego.

199
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:49,407
- What is all this, Father?
- Well, I am no longer alcalde.

200
00:17:49,493 --> 00:17:54,772
- In my place is a man...
- In his place sits a viper so foul and black...

201
00:17:54,853 --> 00:17:58,482
Ah, to be alone with him
for five little minutes.

202
00:17:58,573 --> 00:18:01,770
Long enough to tear
his windpipe out of his throat.

203
00:18:01,853 --> 00:18:04,162
God forgive me.

204
00:18:04,253 --> 00:18:07,962
- Why did you resign in the first place?
- I was forced out of office.

205
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,328
They threatened
to burn the homes of the peons.

206
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:14,611
- And now he sits here doing nothing, when...
- Enough, Felipe.

207
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,810
The friar urges me
to lead the caballeros in a revolt

208
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:20,965
which would surely fail
against a garrison of trained soldiers.

209
00:18:21,053 --> 00:18:24,125
Even if I thought it would succeed,
I'd refuse just the same.

210
00:18:24,213 --> 00:18:27,842
- But why?
- Because the law is the law.

211
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:30,686
I will not rebel against the government
I served for 30 years.

212
00:18:30,773 --> 00:18:32,923
But that government is now vile and corrupt.

213
00:18:33,013 --> 00:18:37,165
I know, but two wrongs
don't make a right, and never will.

214
00:18:37,253 --> 00:18:41,690
- That is my feeling also.
- Sometimes, one must fight fire with fire.

215
00:18:41,773 --> 00:18:46,722
I am a Vega. I will not follow
the lawless footsteps of Luis Quintero.

216
00:18:46,813 --> 00:18:51,204
- Nor will my son.
- No, of course not.

217
00:18:51,293 --> 00:18:54,842
By the way, I went directly
from the ship to our old home.

218
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:59,688
I met Senor Quintero and his charming wife.
I found them very pleasant and agreeable.

219
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:03,368
Pleasant scorpions.
Agreeable rattlesnakes.

220
00:19:03,453 --> 00:19:07,412
Oh, Padre. The alcalde spoke
with great respect of you, Father.

221
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:12,408
I must admit he hasn't
troubled me or my flocks so far.

222
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:18,565
That being the case,
why get overly excited in this heat?

223
00:19:18,653 --> 00:19:21,770
I know I'm going to miss
the scented breezes of Spain.

224
00:19:21,853 --> 00:19:26,973
Then you believe we should not be moved
by injustice and cruelty until it touches us?

225
00:19:27,053 --> 00:19:31,968
But, my dear Padre, such things
exist in the world and always will.

226
00:19:32,053 --> 00:19:35,682
By the way, I took up sleight of hand
while I was in Madrid.

227
00:19:35,773 --> 00:19:39,163
It's all the rage just now.
Watch closely.

228
00:19:50,653 --> 00:19:53,565
To think that the boy that I helped to raise,

229
00:19:53,653 --> 00:19:59,330
the boy that I taught to hold a firm wrist
behind a true point, has turned into a puppy.

230
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:09,653
How vexatious. Well, I must go
and remove the dust of travel.

231
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:12,008
I'll see you later, Father.

232
00:22:13,613 --> 00:22:16,002
Stay where you are.

233
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:24,562
Put this up.
Put it up. Be quick about it.

234
00:22:36,973 --> 00:22:39,362
Back to the barracks.

235
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,400
Special Notice:
"To all men in the district

236
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,600
of Los Angeles be it known
that Luis Quintero is a thief

237
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,800
and an enemy of the people,
and cannot long escape

238
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,200
my vengeance."
Zorro

239
00:23:29,853 --> 00:23:34,927
I don't understand why you insist on
this stupid drive. And without an escort.

240
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:39,211
- I have my reasons.
- Suppose you share them with me.

241
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:46,527
Look... Gold. An agent of the Bank
of Madrid is meeting us in a quiet inn.

242
00:23:46,613 --> 00:23:49,252
This goes to Spain.
For us, my love.

243
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,767
I see.
How stupid of me.

244
00:23:51,853 --> 00:23:55,562
- A military guard would...
- Let Esteban know about this transaction.

245
00:23:55,653 --> 00:23:59,362
- Of course, he would have claimed his share.
- I'm afraid so.

246
00:24:02,853 --> 00:24:05,447
Don't move if you want to live.

247
00:24:13,213 --> 00:24:16,330
- A bandit.
- I have distressing news for you.

248
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,881
I had a small drinking bout
with the agent of the Bank of Madrid.

249
00:24:18,973 --> 00:24:21,533
While in his cups,
the fellow was somewhat indiscreet.

250
00:24:21,613 --> 00:24:25,526
A drunken man is untrustworthy.
I will act for him. Hand it over.

251
00:24:31,093 --> 00:24:33,971
- And that little trinket.
- You would rob a woman?

252
00:24:34,053 --> 00:24:36,487
- I can't afford gallantries.
- I refuse. You dare not take it.

253
00:24:36,573 --> 00:24:40,168
Quickly. I should hate
to mark such a lovely cheek.

254
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:46,445
This time I take only your money.
Next time...

255
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,800
"5000 pesos reward
for information leading

256
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,800
to the capture of the bandit ZORRO."
Luis B. Quintero / The Mayor

257
00:26:24,053 --> 00:26:29,286
What a nice, quiet study, Your Excellency.
I like a quiet room. Very quiet.

258
00:26:30,893 --> 00:26:33,282
What do you want?

259
00:26:35,133 --> 00:26:39,809
A little talk with you, that's all -
if we come to an understanding.

260
00:26:39,893 --> 00:26:44,569
Do you think the climate in Spain
will agree with you?

261
00:26:44,653 --> 00:26:46,769
Why do you ask?

262
00:26:46,853 --> 00:26:50,732
Because you're either going there or
to some place you might not like so well.

263
00:26:50,813 --> 00:26:53,202
Which will it be?

264
00:26:54,253 --> 00:26:57,325
- Spain.
- It's a very wise choice.

265
00:26:58,013 --> 00:27:01,562
Now to the matter of your successor.
What do you think of Don Alejandro Vega?

266
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:03,803
He's had experience.

267
00:27:03,893 --> 00:27:06,771
- What does it matter to me?
- Nothing.

268
00:27:06,853 --> 00:27:09,242
But to the people of this district, a great deal.

269
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:12,131
When you resign, you'll appoint
Don Alejandro as your successor.

270
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,443
As you wish.

271
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:25,290
This will remind you that
I have been here once, and can return.

272
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:29,243
- Close your eyes.
- What are you going to do?

273
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:48,168
- What's that?
- The point of my sword against your throat.

274
00:27:48,253 --> 00:27:50,767
Don't move until I take it away.

275
00:27:50,853 --> 00:27:54,846
- What if I faint?
- You won't.

276
00:28:05,213 --> 00:28:09,092
What's this?
Are you trying to commit suicide?

277
00:28:09,173 --> 00:28:12,609
Speak up.
What's the matter?

278
00:28:19,373 --> 00:28:22,922
- He was here.
- Who was here?

279
00:28:26,133 --> 00:28:27,930
Ridiculous.

280
00:28:28,013 --> 00:28:32,052
- Your fears have addled your brain.
- I tell you, he was here. In this very room.

281
00:28:41,213 --> 00:28:44,205
- Anybody pass by this way?
- No one.

282
00:28:47,373 --> 00:28:50,331
- Has anyone entered this room?
- His Excellency and yourself.

283
00:28:50,413 --> 00:28:53,405
- Anyone else?
- No.

284
00:28:55,013 --> 00:28:59,803
Do you need any more proof?
You must have fallen asleep and dreamed it.

285
00:28:59,893 --> 00:29:02,487
Did I dream that?

286
00:29:07,773 --> 00:29:14,565
Sergeant, turn out the guard. Zorro is
somewhere on the grounds. Find him.

287
00:29:15,573 --> 00:29:17,404
I still can't believe the fellow was here.

288
00:29:17,493 --> 00:29:20,644
If you'd sat here with a sword at your throat,
perhaps you'd believe it.

289
00:29:20,733 --> 00:29:23,008
- How on earth did he get in?
- That's what I'd like to know.

290
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:26,722
- And it's your business to find out.
- What did he say?

291
00:29:26,813 --> 00:29:30,806
He wants me in Spain
and Vega in my place.

292
00:29:33,933 --> 00:29:38,370
Now we have something.
This Zorro is a caballero.

293
00:29:38,453 --> 00:29:40,967
A ordinary brigand wouldn't
concern himself with Vega.

294
00:29:41,053 --> 00:29:45,569
- It would serve you right if I did go to Spain.
- And give up 50,000 pesos a year?

295
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:49,009
I can't collect it if I'm dead.
And you get a third for protecting me.

296
00:29:49,093 --> 00:29:52,290
But what protection! You can't keep
even keep one mad dog off my neck.

297
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,523
Can't I?
I'll find him, I promise you.

298
00:29:54,613 --> 00:29:57,923
In the meantime, I'll put a solid wall
of men around this house night and day.

299
00:29:58,013 --> 00:30:00,925
- I can't afford to lose you, my dear Luis.
- No, You can't.

300
00:30:01,013 --> 00:30:03,004
Your pickings end
if anything happens to me.

301
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:06,483
That's exactly what I meant, Excellency.

302
00:30:27,213 --> 00:30:32,162
Blessed Mother, send someone
to take me from this dreary place.

303
00:30:32,253 --> 00:30:34,642
Someone I can love and respect.

304
00:30:35,893 --> 00:30:43,083
Let him be kind and brave.
And handsome, please, dear Mother.

305
00:31:03,693 --> 00:31:07,527
Fray Ramón, I didn't see you when I came in.

306
00:31:07,613 --> 00:31:11,526
I'm not Fray Ramón.
I'm Fray Pablo, from the mission.

307
00:31:11,613 --> 00:31:14,650
I've just been spending
the evening with Fray Ramón.

308
00:31:14,733 --> 00:31:21,445
Father, I was asking the Holy Mother
to save me from a convent.

309
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:26,243
- Is that a sin?
- The sin would be in sending you to one.

310
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:31,361
- I don't understand.
- Well, a young girl with your...

311
00:31:32,493 --> 00:31:38,204
I just think that you would probably be
more useful outside a convent than in.

312
00:31:38,293 --> 00:31:43,128
- You mean in serving God?
- Yes, in a way.

313
00:31:43,213 --> 00:31:45,249
In what way?

314
00:31:47,253 --> 00:31:52,725
Well, the Church must have sons
and daughters, if she is to flourish.

315
00:31:52,813 --> 00:31:56,601
- Do you follow me?
- I think so.

316
00:31:56,693 --> 00:32:00,163
- You mean that I might marry and...
- Yes, exactly.

317
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:04,451
Strong sons and fine daughters
to the glory of God.

318
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:08,287
I was praying just now for a husband.

319
00:32:08,373 --> 00:32:11,365
You were? Fine.

320
00:32:11,453 --> 00:32:14,809
I mean, it's quite natural
at your age, my child.

321
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:21,082
Yes, but it's not natural for a girl of my age
to long for a husband to rescue her.

322
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:24,006
- From what?
- Father...

323
00:32:24,773 --> 00:32:29,767
Will you sit here and talk to me
for a little while? I'm troubled, deeply.

324
00:32:37,053 --> 00:32:41,251
I want to leave this lonely place.
I want to meet young people.

325
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:45,008
Girls of my own age.
No one ever comes here.

326
00:32:45,093 --> 00:32:47,926
The caballeros avoid this place
like the pest house.

327
00:32:48,013 --> 00:32:52,564
- Why?
- They hate my Uncle Luis.

328
00:32:52,653 --> 00:32:56,089
You know, I feel that
there's something wrong about him.

329
00:32:56,173 --> 00:32:59,006
Decidedly wrong.
What do you think?

330
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:03,371
If people hate him as you say,
you have your answer there.

331
00:33:03,453 --> 00:33:08,652
Then I was right. Perhaps I should be glad
my Aunt Inez is sending me to a convent.

332
00:33:08,733 --> 00:33:11,042
No, don't be glad about that.

333
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:16,048
I mean, probably your aunt feels that
that atmosphere is better for a young girl,

334
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:18,852
- but I'm convinced...
- Inez? Oh, no.

335
00:33:18,933 --> 00:33:21,208
No. That's not why she's sending me.

336
00:33:23,053 --> 00:33:29,572
María says she's jealous.
She says it's because I'm good-looking.

337
00:33:29,653 --> 00:33:36,047
- María has excellent eyesight.
- Thank you, Father, but are you sure?

338
00:33:36,133 --> 00:33:38,886
No one except María ever says I'm pretty.

339
00:33:39,813 --> 00:33:45,763
Pretty? Why, you are more radiant,
more lovely than a morning in June.

340
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:48,893
You really think that?

341
00:33:48,973 --> 00:33:53,763
- With all my heart.
- I've never heard such words before.

342
00:33:53,853 --> 00:33:56,492
They make me almost lose my breath.

343
00:33:57,653 --> 00:34:01,362
You should hear such words
every hour of the day.

344
00:34:01,453 --> 00:34:04,650
You're not in the least like Fray Ramón.

345
00:34:05,773 --> 00:34:08,571
You talk so strangely.

346
00:34:29,653 --> 00:34:34,568
You're not a padre. You're an impostor.
You're wearing a sword.

347
00:34:36,693 --> 00:34:38,843
We've been looking everywhere for you.

348
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:41,527
Zorro broke into the house
and threatened your uncle.

349
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:43,604
They think he's still hiding
somewhere close by.

350
00:34:43,693 --> 00:34:47,129
Come along. Lock the doors
after we leave, Fray Ramón.

351
00:34:47,213 --> 00:34:50,205
The beast may try to rob the altar.

352
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:53,522
Good night, Padre.

353
00:35:28,533 --> 00:35:31,331
Padre, you dropped something.

354
00:35:41,493 --> 00:35:43,529
There he is.

355
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:12,330
There.

356
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,800
"20,000 pesos REWARD
for the capture of the bandit ZORRO.

357
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,200
Dead or alive." Luis B. Quintero / The Mayor

358
00:38:06,773 --> 00:38:09,367
Three pesos.

359
00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:14,728
Three pesos.

360
00:38:21,373 --> 00:38:23,967
Four pesos.

361
00:38:32,973 --> 00:38:36,932
- Nine pesos.
- I cannot pay so much.

362
00:38:37,013 --> 00:38:39,288
I swear, it will leave me without a centavo.

363
00:38:41,173 --> 00:38:44,609
- Nine pesos.
- But we will starve.

364
00:38:44,693 --> 00:38:48,527
- How can I feed my family?
- Nine pesos.

365
00:38:48,613 --> 00:38:51,650
Please, I beg of you.
My little girl...

366
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:01,488
That's all.

367
00:39:05,413 --> 00:39:08,211
I'll relieve you of that, Sergeant.

368
00:39:17,493 --> 00:39:19,882
I'll take that.

369
00:39:22,533 --> 00:39:24,330
Get back.

370
00:39:30,933 --> 00:39:33,128
After him.

371
00:41:00,613 --> 00:41:04,128
Hear our prayer.

372
00:41:04,533 --> 00:41:08,890
And drive far away from it...

373
00:41:08,973 --> 00:41:13,046
all the snares of the enemy.

374
00:41:13,133 --> 00:41:18,730
And let thy holy angels dwell therein...

375
00:41:18,813 --> 00:41:21,725
to keep us at peace.

376
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:25,010
And may thy blessings...

377
00:41:25,093 --> 00:41:28,802
be upon us always.

378
00:42:17,613 --> 00:42:19,763
Good evening, Padre.

379
00:42:19,853 --> 00:42:24,005
It was so dull at home, and I remembered
that you played a fair game of chess.

380
00:42:24,093 --> 00:42:28,609
So I took the liberty of riding over
and setting up the men.

381
00:42:30,413 --> 00:42:32,768
What's the meaning of this?
How dare you?

382
00:42:32,853 --> 00:42:35,526
We are after Zorro.
We saw him ride toward the mission.

383
00:42:35,613 --> 00:42:38,491
Good evening, Sergeant.

384
00:42:38,573 --> 00:42:43,408
- Zorro, you say? What's he done now?
- Enough to get himself hanged.

385
00:42:43,493 --> 00:42:46,803
- Have you seen him?
- I have only this moment left the chapel.

386
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:52,085
- How long have you been here?
- Some little time. It seems like hours.

387
00:42:52,173 --> 00:42:55,483
I've been waiting to play chess
with the good padre.

388
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:59,691
- It's a dull game, but what can one do?
- You have seen or heard nothing?

389
00:42:59,773 --> 00:43:03,129
Of Zorro? Heaven spare me.
My blood chills at the thought.

390
00:43:03,653 --> 00:43:06,247
Out of here.
Search the grounds.

391
00:43:09,173 --> 00:43:12,927
What's disturbing you, Padre?
Thoughts of that bandit?

392
00:43:13,013 --> 00:43:16,972
- Puppy.
- Oh, my dear Padre, really.

393
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:21,524
When I think of what one man, single-handed,
has accomplished against these devils,

394
00:43:21,613 --> 00:43:27,848
and see you, the last of the Vegas, trembling
at the very mention of his name, I could...

395
00:43:27,933 --> 00:43:30,049
Can't you even listen to me?

396
00:43:30,133 --> 00:43:34,092
Ordinarily, I'd drink in
every word you say, butjust now...

397
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:38,046
Thank you, Mother.

398
00:43:38,773 --> 00:43:41,526
- Quick. Hide this plunder.
- Plunder?

399
00:43:41,613 --> 00:43:45,003
Don't stand there gaping at me
like a fish. Put it away.

400
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:57,372
- What is this?
- It's some of the alcalde's gold.

401
00:43:57,453 --> 00:44:01,765
And this I took from his charming wife.
It's pretty, don't you think?

402
00:44:02,853 --> 00:44:05,242
You took it?

403
00:44:06,253 --> 00:44:09,245
Have you seen this one, Padre?

404
00:44:14,253 --> 00:44:18,769
So my old mentor has no more wit
than the rest of them, eh?

405
00:44:18,853 --> 00:44:21,925
Are you trying to make me
the receiver of stolen goods?

406
00:44:22,013 --> 00:44:24,686
No, the dispenser.

407
00:44:24,773 --> 00:44:28,766
This gold was wrung from the peons.
It's up to us to restore it to them.

408
00:44:33,773 --> 00:44:36,162
My boy.

409
00:44:36,253 --> 00:44:40,724
My boy.
My Diego.

410
00:44:43,853 --> 00:44:46,970
Then you will lead your people
against these scorpions?

411
00:44:47,053 --> 00:44:52,047
No, we'd be no match for their trained
troops. My father was right about that.

412
00:44:52,133 --> 00:44:55,967
You must have had the alcalde at your mercy
when you took the gold from him.

413
00:44:56,053 --> 00:44:59,807
I would have snuffed him out like a candle.
God forgive me.

414
00:44:59,893 --> 00:45:03,488
It would accomplish nothing.
Anotherjust like him would take his place.

415
00:45:03,573 --> 00:45:05,723
I see.

416
00:45:05,813 --> 00:45:11,763
I see everything.
Diego, don't deceive your father any longer.

417
00:45:11,853 --> 00:45:16,722
- It's not fair to him.
- I don't like doing it. Believe me.

418
00:45:16,813 --> 00:45:18,804
But I must.

419
00:45:18,893 --> 00:45:22,886
My father is such a stickler for law and order,
that I'm afraid he might spoil all the fun.

420
00:45:22,973 --> 00:45:26,124
But what do you hope to achieve
all alone, taking his money?

421
00:45:26,213 --> 00:45:27,646
Oh, no.

422
00:45:27,733 --> 00:45:34,047
But I may be able to persuade him
to resign and name my father in his place.

423
00:45:34,133 --> 00:45:38,126
- Amusing, don't you think?
- If you live.

424
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,400
Special Notice:
"Good people of Los Angeles,

425
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,600
do not give up nope. Luis Quintero
will soon resign and leave for Spain

426
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,200
or his blood shall drip
from my sword." Zorro

427
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:08,032
Dona Inez begs you to make yourself
comfortable. She'll be down shortly.

428
00:46:08,114 --> 00:46:10,309
What's this?

429
00:46:10,394 --> 00:46:16,264
- Don Diego Vega.
- Oh, yes. What can I do for you?

430
00:46:16,354 --> 00:46:20,393
Have you forgotten that you urged me
to regard this house as still my home?

431
00:46:20,474 --> 00:46:21,987
Did I?

432
00:46:22,074 --> 00:46:26,067
It's very good of you to remember the offer,
but didn't you have trouble getting in?

433
00:46:26,154 --> 00:46:30,227
Oh, no. I had a note from Dona Inez
asking me to ride with her this morning,

434
00:46:30,314 --> 00:46:33,306
and I just showed it to the sentries.

435
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:38,268
Excellent.

436
00:46:38,354 --> 00:46:41,266
Come into my study till my wife appears.

437
00:46:41,354 --> 00:46:45,347
It's been Esteban's privilege
to ride with her each morning.

438
00:46:50,554 --> 00:46:55,708
Why is this house so closely guarded?
I swear I saw a full company around it.

439
00:46:55,794 --> 00:46:59,753
- I wish there were twice as many.
- Their clatter would drive me to distraction.

440
00:46:59,834 --> 00:47:04,954
I find it reassuring.
Let me show you something, young man.

441
00:47:07,514 --> 00:47:09,505
Look.

442
00:47:10,714 --> 00:47:12,511
The mark of Zorro.

443
00:47:12,594 --> 00:47:16,587
He came here one night.
He threatened my life and left that.

444
00:47:18,954 --> 00:47:21,343
I should be petrified.

445
00:47:22,434 --> 00:47:24,664
He's mad, of course.
Quite mad.

446
00:47:24,754 --> 00:47:28,144
- You think so?
- Of course.

447
00:47:28,234 --> 00:47:31,909
There was a case in Madrid, almost identical.

448
00:47:31,994 --> 00:47:35,703
This fellow's mark was a cross.
He was a madman.

449
00:47:35,794 --> 00:47:38,513
Cunning beyond belief.
They always are.

450
00:47:38,594 --> 00:47:43,349
He killed 40 people.
Slit their throats from ear to ear.

451
00:47:43,434 --> 00:47:47,029
Warned them first, you know, and then...

452
00:47:48,594 --> 00:47:52,030
It's a pity your sense of duty keeps you here.

453
00:47:52,114 --> 00:47:55,504
- Frightful risk.
- Sense of duty?

454
00:47:55,594 --> 00:47:57,585
Yes, of course.

455
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:02,270
I'm so sorry to have kept you.
Esteban was surly about our little ride.

456
00:48:02,354 --> 00:48:07,303
- I'd promised the morning to him, it seems.
- Your invitation was a smile from heaven.

457
00:48:07,394 --> 00:48:12,070
- I was positively suffocating with boredom.
- Then let's fly. I'm dying for a canter.

458
00:48:12,154 --> 00:48:14,714
Goodbye, Luis.
Don't work too hard.

459
00:48:14,794 --> 00:48:17,388
Goodbye, Excellency.

460
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:33,502
Esteban, Vegajust told me a horrible tale
about a madman in Madrid, like this Zorro.

461
00:48:33,594 --> 00:48:37,746
- He thinks I risk my life by staying here.
- Forget your fears. I have a plan.

462
00:48:37,834 --> 00:48:40,064
Yes?
What is it?

463
00:48:40,154 --> 00:48:45,945
Don Alejandro is the leader of the caballeros.
Zorro wants you to appoint him in your place.

464
00:48:46,034 --> 00:48:49,822
- What do you gather from that?
- Go on.

465
00:48:49,914 --> 00:48:53,384
Doesn't it suggest to you that Zorro
is the tool of Don Alejandro?

466
00:48:53,474 --> 00:48:58,343
- Perhaps, but how can we prove it?
- We can at least help the situation.

467
00:48:58,434 --> 00:49:01,392
- How?
- Form an alliance with Don Alejandro.

468
00:49:01,474 --> 00:49:04,784
That's impossible.
You know Vega's attitude.

469
00:49:04,874 --> 00:49:08,753
Perfectly, but Lolita should have a husband.

470
00:49:08,834 --> 00:49:12,065
What could be stronger
than a matrimonial alliance?

471
00:49:12,154 --> 00:49:15,351
Royal families keep
the peace of Europe in bridal beds.

472
00:49:15,434 --> 00:49:17,629
Diego and Lolita.

473
00:49:18,594 --> 00:49:20,789
Not bad.

474
00:49:21,994 --> 00:49:24,462
Not bad at all.

475
00:49:28,514 --> 00:49:34,908
Diego, talking with you is like
a drink of cool water in the desert.

476
00:49:36,154 --> 00:49:39,305
- Oh, it's a pity.
- What?

477
00:49:39,394 --> 00:49:44,946
- I mustn't make you discontented.
- Oh, please. Of what were you thinking?

478
00:49:45,034 --> 00:49:47,423
I was just thinking
how you're being wasted here.

479
00:49:47,514 --> 00:49:51,223
Your beauty, your gift for words,
your perfect poise.

480
00:49:51,314 --> 00:49:56,104
You were born for something higher
and more civilised than this provincial life.

481
00:49:56,194 --> 00:49:58,264
I know.

482
00:49:58,354 --> 00:50:00,868
- May I tell you something?
- Anything.

483
00:50:00,954 --> 00:50:05,948
Yes, of course I may.
I felt from the moment we met that we...

484
00:50:08,834 --> 00:50:13,669
Esteban is urging me to leave
my husband and go to Spain with him.

485
00:50:13,754 --> 00:50:16,666
- Oh, but my dear, no.
- But I'm dying here.

486
00:50:16,754 --> 00:50:19,473
Go to Spain, but not with Esteban.

487
00:50:20,554 --> 00:50:22,351
With whom, then?

488
00:50:24,034 --> 00:50:27,504
- With your husband.
- My husband?

489
00:50:27,594 --> 00:50:31,553
- Go to romantic, beautiful Spain with Luis?
- Let me explain.

490
00:50:31,634 --> 00:50:36,230
As the wife of the one-time alcalde
of Los Angeles, you'd be received at court.

491
00:50:36,314 --> 00:50:41,024
But as the companion of a second-rate
soldier of fortune, you'd be ostracised.

492
00:50:41,114 --> 00:50:44,868
I see.
But Luis at court, imagine.

493
00:50:44,954 --> 00:50:48,663
In Spain the husbands of adorable ladies
are merely background.

494
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,951
- I'd be lost among so many.
- Not you.

495
00:50:52,034 --> 00:50:55,629
You'd need only one "friend"
to introduce you into the proper circles.

496
00:50:55,714 --> 00:50:58,512
But I have no such friend in Madrid.

497
00:50:58,594 --> 00:51:02,587
Who knows? I don't intend
to remain in California for ever.

498
00:51:12,594 --> 00:51:18,863
- What you suggest is utterly impossible.
- I'll give a dowry of 20,000 pesos. 25,000.

499
00:51:18,954 --> 00:51:22,026
Are you buying my son, Senor Quintero?

500
00:51:22,114 --> 00:51:25,709
- There's the practical side to consider.
- It doesn't enter into this.

501
00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:29,548
You come here on a friendly mission
with half a company of troops. Why?

502
00:51:29,634 --> 00:51:32,944
Not to threaten you, Don Alejandro.
It's because of this Zorro.

503
00:51:33,034 --> 00:51:37,630
Zorro is only a symptom. This district
is bleeding under your vile administration.

504
00:51:37,714 --> 00:51:40,274
I would never appear to condone it
by marriage between our families.

505
00:51:40,354 --> 00:51:44,791
In that case, the friendly attitude
I've taken towards you, will cease.

506
00:51:45,874 --> 00:51:48,183
What is all this turmoil about?

507
00:51:48,274 --> 00:51:52,586
His Excellency has offered a marriage
between his niece Lolita and you.

508
00:51:52,674 --> 00:51:54,869
His niece?
How flattering.

509
00:51:54,954 --> 00:51:58,026
But why should that cause
an argument on a hot day like this?

510
00:51:58,114 --> 00:52:00,582
- Do I have to explain?
- Your father resents my efforts

511
00:52:00,674 --> 00:52:04,223
to make the people of the district
more industrious than under his regime.

512
00:52:04,314 --> 00:52:07,989
Grinding them into poverty and despair
to line your own pockets is hardly...

513
00:52:08,074 --> 00:52:11,464
Oh, politics, politics.
What have they to do with my marriage?

514
00:52:11,554 --> 00:52:15,706
- You'd marry into the family of this...?
- How can I tell until I've seen her?

515
00:52:15,794 --> 00:52:19,582
- She may look like her uncle.
- Quite right. I...

516
00:52:19,674 --> 00:52:25,146
Oh, no. She's a sweet little dove. It would
desolate us to have her leave the nest.

517
00:52:25,234 --> 00:52:27,509
If she were Venus,
she'd still be his niece.

518
00:52:27,594 --> 00:52:31,507
But, after all,
I'm not marrying His Excellency.

519
00:52:34,794 --> 00:52:39,310
Don't you think the wishes of your father
in this sort of matter should be considered?

520
00:52:39,394 --> 00:52:44,593
I had no say in my father's marriage.
Why should he try to instruct me in mine?

521
00:52:44,674 --> 00:52:48,030
Exactly.
Will you dine with us tonight?

522
00:52:48,114 --> 00:52:51,709
- Charmed.
- We'll expect you at eight o'clock.

523
00:52:55,754 --> 00:52:58,632
Diego, what have you done?

524
00:52:58,714 --> 00:53:00,591
It will be all right.

525
00:53:00,674 --> 00:53:05,270
No matter what you think now,
please don't worry.

526
00:53:18,914 --> 00:53:23,146
This was your doing, you sly beast.
You gave Luis the idea of this marriage.

527
00:53:23,234 --> 00:53:28,183
Alliances for the good of the state have
been fashionable since the dawn of history.

528
00:53:29,034 --> 00:53:34,108
- María, my knees are shaking.
- Yes, that is natural.

529
00:53:34,194 --> 00:53:40,713
- Shall I bow, or give him my hand to kiss?
- Both. First the hand, then the bow.

530
00:53:41,394 --> 00:53:46,309
It's 20 minutes past the hour.
What can be keeping him?

531
00:53:48,554 --> 00:53:52,263
Well, well, well.
Here you are at last.

532
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:55,630
I was afraid that you might have been
waylaid by that Zorro fellow.

533
00:53:55,714 --> 00:53:58,592
Oh, heaven spare me.

534
00:53:59,594 --> 00:54:05,464
- I am dazzled.
- And here is our little dove, Lolita.

535
00:54:09,114 --> 00:54:11,753
- I am honoured.
- Charmed, I'm sure.

536
00:54:11,834 --> 00:54:15,622
May I present Senora María de López?

537
00:54:18,754 --> 00:54:23,066
You'll forgive me for being late.
They heated the water for my bath too early.

538
00:54:23,154 --> 00:54:29,548
It was positively tepid. By the time
more was carried and properly scented...

539
00:54:29,634 --> 00:54:33,422
Life can be trying, don't you think?

540
00:54:33,514 --> 00:54:35,948
- Oh, please.
- Courage.

541
00:54:36,034 --> 00:54:40,949
Well, shall we dine?
Come, Diego.

542
00:54:42,434 --> 00:54:44,743
His bath was tepid.

543
00:54:44,834 --> 00:54:48,622
Poor Lolita. I'm afraid
her wedded life will be the same.

544
00:54:57,034 --> 00:55:02,267
- Please do that again.
- As you wish. Observe closely.

545
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,943
- Amazing.
- Quite simple.

546
00:55:10,514 --> 00:55:13,506
- Have you seen this one?
- No.

547
00:55:34,994 --> 00:55:37,792
Now, observe very closely.

548
00:55:40,634 --> 00:55:43,990
- Frightfully amusing.
- Yes, I did this one for His Majesty.

549
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:49,273
- It must be heavenly at court.
- It's the one bearable spot on earth.

550
00:55:49,354 --> 00:55:53,472
Speaking of that Zorro, Excellency,
could you provide me with an escort home?

551
00:55:53,554 --> 00:55:58,344
On the way here, I fancied that cutthroat
lurking in every shadow. I was unnerved.

552
00:55:58,434 --> 00:56:00,823
How distressing.

553
00:56:01,914 --> 00:56:06,783
- You don't approve of my request.
- You called her hero a cutthroat.

554
00:56:07,794 --> 00:56:10,627
Have you met the fellow?

555
00:56:10,714 --> 00:56:15,663
I've never so much as seen his face.
I happen to admire courage.

556
00:56:15,754 --> 00:56:19,793
Dashing about with a cutlass has been
out of fashion since the Middle Ages.

557
00:56:19,874 --> 00:56:25,744
It seems to be quite effective. He is like
a lion among a lot of frightened sheep.

558
00:56:25,834 --> 00:56:28,712
A madman, that's what he is.

559
00:56:28,794 --> 00:56:30,785
Undoubtedly.

560
00:56:33,794 --> 00:56:38,185
Capitán, you seem to regard
that poor fruit as an enemy.

561
00:56:39,514 --> 00:56:41,709
A rival.

562
00:56:43,354 --> 00:56:46,630
My dear Esteban is for ever
thrusting at this and that.

563
00:56:46,714 --> 00:56:49,831
He used to be
a fencing instructor in Barcelona.

564
00:56:49,914 --> 00:56:52,269
How exhausting.

565
00:56:52,354 --> 00:56:55,266
- I didn't find it so.
- Then why did you give it up?

566
00:56:55,354 --> 00:57:00,189
- Unfortunately, I killed a man of influence.
- A lady was involved, I believe.

567
00:57:01,194 --> 00:57:04,504
The gentleman's wife, no doubt?

568
00:57:04,594 --> 00:57:07,870
Just how did you mean that?

569
00:57:07,954 --> 00:57:11,026
I'd hoped to be amusing.
Have I failed?

570
00:57:11,114 --> 00:57:12,866
Somewhat.
With me.

571
00:57:15,994 --> 00:57:20,704
What are the new dance steps?
You know them all, I suppose.

572
00:57:20,794 --> 00:57:23,786
- I'm afraid so.
- I would so love to have you show me.

573
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:25,865
Gladly.

574
00:57:29,114 --> 00:57:32,993
- Inez would enjoy it more.
- Nonsense, my child. Dance with him.

575
00:57:39,714 --> 00:57:41,466
Play "El Sombrero Blanco".

576
00:59:03,194 --> 00:59:06,789
I never dreamed dancing
could be so wonderful.

577
00:59:08,114 --> 00:59:11,470
I found it rather fatiguing.

578
00:59:11,554 --> 00:59:15,547
- If you'll excuse me, I wish to retire.
- So sorry.

579
00:59:22,194 --> 00:59:25,584
- What's got into the girl?
- Who knows?

580
00:59:28,114 --> 00:59:31,106
- Our little dove has flown.
- I don't like it.

581
00:59:34,634 --> 00:59:37,512
You can't be serious about this marriage.

582
00:59:37,594 --> 00:59:39,312
But, my dear, it's perfect.

583
00:59:39,394 --> 00:59:43,945
You and I could be seen together anywhere
in Madrid without any danger of gossip.

584
00:59:46,034 --> 00:59:50,232
- Excellency, your niece is charming.
- A sweet child.

585
00:59:50,314 --> 00:59:53,989
May I plead with you
for her hand in marriage?

586
00:59:54,074 --> 00:59:56,508
A refusal would crush me.

587
00:59:56,594 --> 01:00:01,952
She's yours, my dear Diego,
with all my blessings.

588
01:00:48,234 --> 01:00:50,225
Who's there?

589
01:00:56,034 --> 01:00:58,912
- I have a confession to make.
- Please go. You'll be caught.

590
01:00:58,994 --> 01:01:01,713
I must talk to you.

591
01:01:03,794 --> 01:01:05,591
Now, look here, my girl.

592
01:01:05,674 --> 01:01:08,632
What do you mean by running away from the
man to whom I've promised you in marriage?

593
01:01:08,714 --> 01:01:11,865
- You've done that without asking me?
- Of course.

594
01:01:11,954 --> 01:01:16,744
What do you know about such things?
And it's time that you understood that...

595
01:01:16,834 --> 01:01:18,950
- Who's that?
- No one.

596
01:01:20,754 --> 01:01:24,952
Forgive me, my dear.
I've been an old fool.

597
01:01:27,674 --> 01:01:32,509
You seem to know how to handle these
matters much better than your Uncle Luis.

598
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:36,787
You?

599
01:01:36,874 --> 01:01:39,468
Don't come in here.

600
01:01:41,514 --> 01:01:44,108
I have something important to say to you
and I don't want to be interrupted.

601
01:01:44,194 --> 01:01:48,631
You, pretending to be Zorro.
I don't care to hear anything you have to say.

602
01:01:48,714 --> 01:01:51,512
So unlock that door and go.

603
01:01:59,914 --> 01:02:04,749
I'm glad to see you took the advice
I gave you in the chapel.

604
01:02:04,834 --> 01:02:08,827
About not hiding such beauty in a convent.

605
01:02:08,914 --> 01:02:11,303
What did you say?

606
01:02:12,594 --> 01:02:16,473
You're more lovely,
more radiant than a morning in June.

607
01:02:16,554 --> 01:02:19,352
Surely I must be dreaming.

608
01:02:20,674 --> 01:02:24,269
- You are Zorro.
- Yes, Lolita.

609
01:02:24,354 --> 01:02:29,269
In order to accomplish what I set out to do,
I've had to deceive people, including you.

610
01:02:29,354 --> 01:02:31,743
Yes, I see.

611
01:02:32,954 --> 01:02:36,264
I understand.
You don't have to explain.

612
01:02:36,354 --> 01:02:39,426
You came here to tell me that asking
to marry me was just part of the game.

613
01:02:39,514 --> 01:02:45,305
Oh, no. That's the one real thing
about this whole masquerade.

614
01:02:46,514 --> 01:02:49,187
- Go quickly.
- Ride with me tomorrow.

615
01:02:49,274 --> 01:02:50,946
Yes, but go.

616
01:02:55,394 --> 01:02:57,783
Be careful.

617
01:03:00,034 --> 01:03:04,266
- Open the door.
- Yes, I'm coming.

618
01:03:09,434 --> 01:03:13,188
You seem upset, my dear.
Have you been crying?

619
01:03:13,274 --> 01:03:17,665
- Yes, I have.
- I understand.

620
01:03:19,234 --> 01:03:24,706
This marriage was your uncle's idea.
He's not your type, and far too sophisticated.

621
01:03:24,794 --> 01:03:27,945
- You really think so?
- Beyond a question.

622
01:03:28,874 --> 01:03:33,072
I saw how he affected you tonight.
My heart bled for you, my dear.

623
01:03:33,154 --> 01:03:37,272
When you tell Luis you'll have none of
this marriage, you'll have my full support.

624
01:03:37,354 --> 01:03:42,223
I hardly know what to say.
Uncle Luis has done so much for me.

625
01:03:43,354 --> 01:03:47,347
Nonsense. He has no right
to expect you to spoil your life.

626
01:03:48,194 --> 01:03:51,903
Any marriage is better than none, I suppose.

627
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:55,669
Perhaps I could learn to tolerate Diego.

628
01:03:55,754 --> 01:03:58,746
I do so want to please Uncle Luis.

629
01:03:59,714 --> 01:04:02,626
There's such a thing
as carrying gratitude too far.

630
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:07,390
We can't ask you to spend your life
with a man you think repulsive.

631
01:04:07,954 --> 01:04:11,310
We'll talk of this again in the morning.

632
01:04:11,394 --> 01:04:14,192
Good night, my dear.

633
01:04:32,274 --> 01:04:35,471
Past midnight.
He's not home yet.

634
01:04:36,714 --> 01:04:40,423
- How can you read?
- It's the latest European styles.

635
01:04:40,514 --> 01:04:44,666
- Bustles are coming in, it seems.
- Bustles! What is a bustle?

636
01:04:44,754 --> 01:04:48,030
It's something to build you up here.

637
01:04:48,114 --> 01:04:51,902
Our only son
in the clutches of those polecats,

638
01:04:51,994 --> 01:04:56,112
and you sit there
planning to decorate your...

639
01:04:59,194 --> 01:05:03,824
There you are. Why didn't you spend
the entire night with your delightful friends?

640
01:05:03,914 --> 01:05:07,668
What have you done about that girl?
Well, how did you get out of it?

641
01:05:07,754 --> 01:05:11,463
She's perfectly charming.
A lovely, unspoiled child.

642
01:05:11,554 --> 01:05:15,945
- You'll be delighted with her, Father.
- I will be delighted? What have you done?

643
01:05:17,354 --> 01:05:20,869
I've just taken the first steps
toward making you a grandfather.

644
01:05:21,234 --> 01:05:23,464
What?

645
01:05:23,554 --> 01:05:26,193
What a son you bore me.

646
01:05:30,754 --> 01:05:35,066
An alliance with those terrible people.
Why did you do it?

647
01:05:35,154 --> 01:05:38,066
- For the best reason in the world.
- What is that?

648
01:05:38,154 --> 01:05:40,748
- Lolita Quintero.
- She attracts you?

649
01:05:40,834 --> 01:05:46,386
- It's more than that. From the day I first saw...
- I thought you hadn't met her until tonight.

650
01:05:46,474 --> 01:05:50,513
I did catch a glimpse of her
some time ago, and...

651
01:05:50,594 --> 01:05:54,906
You're concealing something from us.
I'm sure of it.

652
01:05:54,994 --> 01:05:57,986
- It's time you went to bed.
- Very well.

653
01:05:58,074 --> 01:06:01,271
But, Diego, tell me as soon as you can.

654
01:06:01,354 --> 01:06:03,549
I will, Mother.

655
01:06:13,234 --> 01:06:17,068
- What's the meaning of that?
- Gonzales was collecting taxes.

656
01:06:17,154 --> 01:06:20,032
A priest resisted.
The fool gave him ten lashes.

657
01:06:20,114 --> 01:06:22,503
- Send Gonzales to me.
- I wish I could.

658
01:06:22,594 --> 01:06:26,382
- What's to prevent it?
- The total disappearance of Gonzales.

659
01:06:26,474 --> 01:06:29,386
- He's gone? Where?
- To Hades, I hope.

660
01:06:29,474 --> 01:06:31,624
I'll collect the taxes
myself from now on.

661
01:06:40,554 --> 01:06:43,148
That should teach them.

662
01:06:49,234 --> 01:06:51,225
What's that?

663
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:54,265
You...

664
01:06:54,914 --> 01:06:58,350
- What's that?
- Sergeant Gonzales. I think he's dead.

665
01:06:58,434 --> 01:07:00,390
Dead, you say?

666
01:07:01,554 --> 01:07:04,512
- He's alive.
- He's got a Z on his chest.

667
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:21,744
José.
How is the little one?

668
01:07:21,834 --> 01:07:26,783
She is well again.
I brought this to give thanks to the church.

669
01:07:26,874 --> 01:07:31,072
Give thanks in your heart.
Buy milk for the child with this.

670
01:07:31,154 --> 01:07:34,749
No. This is for the church.

671
01:08:06,354 --> 01:08:08,993
I come at precisely
the right moment, it seems.

672
01:08:12,074 --> 01:08:16,590
- I'll take that.
- These are the funds of the mission.

673
01:08:16,674 --> 01:08:19,905
Not any longer.
Hand them over.

674
01:08:21,194 --> 01:08:24,584
- I refuse.
- In that case, I shall take them.

675
01:08:36,794 --> 01:08:40,582
You should have been a soldier
rather than a churchman.

676
01:08:53,354 --> 01:08:56,346
No wonder you chose the Church.

677
01:09:02,274 --> 01:09:04,549
- Where did you get this?
- I'll tell you nothing.

678
01:09:04,634 --> 01:09:06,864
Run me through and have done with it.

679
01:09:10,794 --> 01:09:15,390
No, my dear Padre.
We shall presently hang you.

680
01:09:22,994 --> 01:09:26,430
For the last time. If you marry that girl,
you leave this house for ever.

681
01:09:26,514 --> 01:09:29,267
It might be rather amusing
to live with the Quinteros.

682
01:09:29,354 --> 01:09:32,027
If I'd only left him in Spain.

683
01:09:32,114 --> 01:09:35,504
Wait till you see her.
She's just like this blossom.

684
01:09:35,594 --> 01:09:38,586
I'll never see her.
I promise you that.

685
01:09:42,314 --> 01:09:45,784
- We are not at home.
- I'm at home to the senorita. Show her in.

686
01:09:45,874 --> 01:09:49,344
- So you defy me, too?
- You're not being sensible.

687
01:09:51,034 --> 01:09:54,424
- Father, this is Lolita.
- I am honoured.

688
01:09:54,514 --> 01:09:57,108
And my mother.

689
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:02,824
Please forgive me, but would it be
possible to see you alone for a moment?

690
01:10:02,914 --> 01:10:06,224
Senorita, will you answer me one question?

691
01:10:06,314 --> 01:10:09,272
- Certainly.
- Do you want to marry my son?

692
01:10:09,994 --> 01:10:13,828
- Why, yes.
- Why?

693
01:10:13,914 --> 01:10:17,702
Well, I love him.

694
01:10:22,114 --> 01:10:26,505
You are right, my son.
She is like the flower.

695
01:10:31,874 --> 01:10:35,389
Something terrible has happened.
They've arrested Fray Felipe.

696
01:10:35,474 --> 01:10:39,228
They say he is Zorro
and they are going to hang him.

697
01:10:39,314 --> 01:10:43,705
- Where is he now?
- At the barracks. What can you do?

698
01:10:45,314 --> 01:10:47,703
I don't know yet.

699
01:10:51,234 --> 01:10:56,183
So far I've only frightened your uncle.
This may mean I'll have to do more than that.

700
01:10:56,274 --> 01:10:59,391
Do you understand?

701
01:10:59,474 --> 01:11:03,626
If that becomes necessary,
will it make any difference between us?

702
01:11:21,594 --> 01:11:25,792
Sentries!
There's someone in that chair. Seize him.

703
01:11:28,634 --> 01:11:32,422
Diego, what are you doing here?
You frightened me half out of my wits.

704
01:11:32,514 --> 01:11:34,391
This is too much, really.

705
01:11:34,474 --> 01:11:37,864
It's distressing enough to call on
my betrothed and not find her at home.

706
01:11:37,954 --> 01:11:42,266
- Now to be manhandled by these ruffians.
- Leave us.

707
01:11:46,154 --> 01:11:48,349
Where is Lolita?

708
01:11:48,434 --> 01:11:52,507
Oh, riding, driving, walking.
What does a young girl do?

709
01:11:52,594 --> 01:11:55,313
Am I to understand
that my betrothed is allowed to

710
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:58,386
wander about the countryside
without a duenna?

711
01:11:58,474 --> 01:12:01,671
I protest, Your Excellency.
I protest strongly.

712
01:12:01,754 --> 01:12:04,746
I can't discuss that now.

713
01:12:04,834 --> 01:12:07,792
Do you know Zorro
had a priest for an accomplice?

714
01:12:07,874 --> 01:12:12,026
We arrested him today.
And another horrible thing happened to me.

715
01:12:12,114 --> 01:12:14,833
Sergeant Gonzales
was beaten half to death by Zorro.

716
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:17,303
He shoved him over the wall
right before my eyes.

717
01:12:17,394 --> 01:12:20,147
How frightful.

718
01:12:22,594 --> 01:12:25,392
But after all, it was harder on Gonzales.

719
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:27,510
This is no time forjesting.

720
01:12:27,594 --> 01:12:31,143
Perhaps, that madman is lurking
on the grounds right now.

721
01:12:38,314 --> 01:12:42,944
What shall I do?
I offer rewards and nothing happens.

722
01:12:43,034 --> 01:12:48,233
He may change his mind about you.
Those creatures usually do, I believe.

723
01:12:48,314 --> 01:12:50,828
He may decide to
cut the throat of someone else.

724
01:12:50,914 --> 01:12:55,942
- Must you always talk of throat-cutting?
- How thoughtless of me.

725
01:12:56,034 --> 01:13:00,824
- What you need is a drop of brandy.
- Yes, brandy...

726
01:13:00,914 --> 01:13:07,547
It's gone. I'm surrounded by idiots.
Stupid servants, stupid soldiers.

727
01:13:08,714 --> 01:13:13,151
I admire you tremendously.
Your courage, your fortitude.

728
01:13:13,234 --> 01:13:17,147
Why, a weaker man would forget
his civic duty and get away from all this.

729
01:13:18,234 --> 01:13:20,623
- You rang, Your Excellency?
- Yes, brandy.

730
01:13:20,714 --> 01:13:25,583
- On the desk, Your Excellency.
- It's not on the desk. Bring some.

731
01:13:26,914 --> 01:13:30,668
A situation of this sort would wreck
my constitution in a week.

732
01:13:30,754 --> 01:13:33,871
But then I haven't the iron nerve
of Your Excellency.

733
01:13:33,954 --> 01:13:38,982
Your Excellency, come quickly.
Something has happened in the cellar.

734
01:13:40,994 --> 01:13:43,792
Guards.
You, follow me.

735
01:13:50,034 --> 01:13:52,264
Look.

736
01:13:52,354 --> 01:13:55,073
Look, Your Excellency.

737
01:14:03,834 --> 01:14:06,792
Here in the cellar, right below my study.

738
01:14:06,874 --> 01:14:08,546
Here's his trail.

739
01:14:14,194 --> 01:14:16,583
It goes this way.

740
01:14:20,474 --> 01:14:22,863
It ends here.

741
01:14:26,674 --> 01:14:29,393
He couldn't have gone through the wall.

742
01:14:29,474 --> 01:14:34,184
He's not human. He's...
Light my way out of here. Quick!

743
01:14:47,994 --> 01:14:51,350
You were right.
I'll leave this cursed place.

744
01:14:51,434 --> 01:14:55,905
I'll do as he asks.
Pen, paper...

745
01:15:00,754 --> 01:15:04,110
A man should consider his wife.

746
01:15:04,194 --> 01:15:09,507
Inez has gone crazy over the idea of Madrid.

747
01:15:09,594 --> 01:15:13,792
She's been at me
night and day to take her there.

748
01:15:15,074 --> 01:15:21,183
This should do it.
This should suit that maniac.

749
01:15:22,194 --> 01:15:25,186
There, look it over.

750
01:15:28,514 --> 01:15:32,427
That's very direct.
But you forgot to sign.

751
01:15:32,514 --> 01:15:35,392
- Sign what?
- My resignation.

752
01:15:35,474 --> 01:15:38,625
Zorro will kill me if I stay.

753
01:15:38,714 --> 01:15:42,992
You may escape him, but I will surely
kill you if you write any more of these.

754
01:15:43,074 --> 01:15:47,067
But I'm in grave danger.
Diego here will bear me out.

755
01:15:47,154 --> 01:15:52,023
You're in even greater danger than he thinks.
So you tried to get gold out of the country?

756
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:57,552
If you ever again take one peso of mine,
I'll cut your throat from ear to ear.

757
01:15:57,634 --> 01:16:01,593
I must ask you to change the subject.
He objects to talk of throat-cutting.

758
01:16:01,674 --> 01:16:05,383
Quiet, you popinjay.
I've no reason for letting you live either.

759
01:16:05,474 --> 01:16:10,264
What a pleasant coincidence.
I feel exactly the same way about you.

760
01:16:10,834 --> 01:16:14,588
You wouldn't care to translate
that feeling into action, would you?

761
01:16:14,674 --> 01:16:17,791
I might be tempted, if I had a weapon.

762
01:16:18,554 --> 01:16:19,873
Would you?

763
01:16:20,514 --> 01:16:23,426
Now, please, gentlemen.

764
01:16:23,514 --> 01:16:28,190
- This is going much too far.
- It's only to serve you, Excellency.

765
01:16:28,274 --> 01:16:31,869
You have a champion, Luis.
And what a champion.

766
01:16:47,754 --> 01:16:50,473
I'll make it short, and save you fatigue.

767
01:17:04,714 --> 01:17:07,911
- Sentries!
- No interference, Excellency, please.

768
01:17:07,994 --> 01:17:10,872
We have a hero with us.

769
01:17:25,554 --> 01:17:29,308
- Are you all right, Diego?
- Ask the capitán.

770
01:17:30,034 --> 01:17:32,229
Get out.

771
01:17:59,394 --> 01:18:01,828
The fencing master has met his equal.

772
01:18:03,754 --> 01:18:05,346
Careful.

773
01:18:05,434 --> 01:18:09,825
- Are you tiring, Diego?
- No, Excellency, I'll take you on in a moment.

774
01:18:19,554 --> 01:18:24,025
- It's a good effort, capitán.
- My next will be better, my fancy clown.

775
01:18:48,634 --> 01:18:53,150
- The capitán's blade is not so firm.
- Still firm enough to run you through.

776
01:19:04,074 --> 01:19:06,747
I needed that scratch to awaken me.

777
01:19:26,994 --> 01:19:31,465
He's dead.
Well, he's been troublesome lately.

778
01:19:32,554 --> 01:19:35,387
And you killed him.

779
01:19:35,474 --> 01:19:39,262
A secret stairway from the cellar.
We just discovered it.

780
01:19:39,354 --> 01:19:43,313
A secret stairway?
Leading here?

781
01:19:47,114 --> 01:19:50,345
Good. Very good.

782
01:19:50,434 --> 01:19:53,631
Excellent.
You shall be rewarded.

783
01:19:53,714 --> 01:19:56,103
Sentries!

784
01:19:58,314 --> 01:20:01,465
Keep that man covered.

785
01:20:01,554 --> 01:20:04,352
Take him to the guardhouse
and lock him in the cell.

786
01:20:04,714 --> 01:20:09,708
- The strongest cell you have.
- Why arrest me, Excellency?

787
01:20:10,914 --> 01:20:15,146
For three reasons. First, you have
mud from the cellar on your boots.

788
01:20:15,234 --> 01:20:18,749
Second, that secret stairway
happens to be in your old home.

789
01:20:18,834 --> 01:20:22,873
And third, you handle a sword
like a devil from hell.

790
01:20:22,954 --> 01:20:26,947
And that's exactly
where you're going, Senor Zorro.

791
01:20:30,474 --> 01:20:34,023
That's a pretty way to treat
your future nephew, Uncle Luis.

792
01:20:34,114 --> 01:20:37,902
No more of your wit.
Take him away.

793
01:20:41,314 --> 01:20:43,305
You, Morales...

794
01:20:44,074 --> 01:20:51,503
Send the officer of the day to me. I want
all caballeros and peons summoned here.

795
01:20:54,274 --> 01:20:58,631
All caballeros are requested to report
at the alcalde's residence immediately.

796
01:20:58,714 --> 01:21:02,468
- At this hour? Ridiculous.
- The alcalde's orders.

797
01:21:03,194 --> 01:21:06,789
Sergeant, assemble your men
for firing-squad duty.

798
01:21:08,034 --> 01:21:11,106
- But why did they arrest Diego?
- I don't know.

799
01:21:11,194 --> 01:21:14,869
Luis won't tell me.
He must have lost his mind.

800
01:21:15,474 --> 01:21:17,351
Come in.

801
01:21:19,034 --> 01:21:22,709
His Excellency requests you ladies
to stay in your rooms tonight.

802
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:27,072
- Why?
- I cannot say. I was ordered to tell you.

803
01:21:30,394 --> 01:21:33,386
Firing squad, forward.

804
01:21:41,674 --> 01:21:44,142
- Good evening.
- Why are we meeting here, Senor Vega?

805
01:21:44,234 --> 01:21:45,872
What do you know, Alejandro?

806
01:21:45,954 --> 01:21:48,673
Nothing. I was forced
to come here like the rest of you.

807
01:21:48,754 --> 01:21:50,346
They must be up to something.

808
01:21:55,354 --> 01:21:58,790
Good evening, senores.
It's a pleasure to see you here.

809
01:21:58,874 --> 01:22:02,150
Get to the point. Why have you
dragged us out of our homes at this hour?

810
01:22:02,234 --> 01:22:07,354
To witness a delightful spectacle.
You will find it particularly interesting.

811
01:22:07,434 --> 01:22:09,709
I'm executing a caballero at midnight.

812
01:22:10,434 --> 01:22:12,425
- What caballero?
- Who is it?

813
01:22:12,514 --> 01:22:17,269
The man you selected from among you
to defy me, to threaten my life.

814
01:22:17,354 --> 01:22:21,586
I brought you here to see him die
as a lesson to the lot of you.

815
01:22:22,994 --> 01:22:26,430
I, for one, don't know
what you're talking about.

816
01:22:28,114 --> 01:22:30,230
You almost convince me.

817
01:22:30,314 --> 01:22:33,067
Too bad you're about to lose
the best actor among you.

818
01:22:33,154 --> 01:22:36,464
But in a few moments,
you'll see your precious Zorro shot.

819
01:22:41,634 --> 01:22:44,865
Observe very closely.
Watch the candle.

820
01:22:47,394 --> 01:22:49,385
Blow.

821
01:22:52,514 --> 01:22:57,383
You should really see something worthwhile,
like changing a copper coin into solid gold.

822
01:22:57,474 --> 01:23:00,227
- Can you do that?
- The good padre here has seen me do it.

823
01:23:00,314 --> 01:23:04,751
- Many times.
- It was a secret discovered by Merlin.

824
01:23:04,834 --> 01:23:09,624
It's been handed down through a long line
of sorcerers to some of us living today.

825
01:23:10,754 --> 01:23:12,984
You can change a centavo into gold?

826
01:23:13,914 --> 01:23:17,270
- Easily.
- Please, do that for me.

827
01:23:17,794 --> 01:23:20,592
I am very weary.
I must seek repose.

828
01:23:20,674 --> 01:23:26,465
I have a wife and seven children,
and the little I earn isn't enough for them.

829
01:23:26,554 --> 01:23:29,785
Please, make gold for them
and I'll pray for you.

830
01:23:31,594 --> 01:23:34,313
If I must, I must.

831
01:23:34,954 --> 01:23:37,832
Now, hold the centavo in your closed fist.

832
01:23:39,474 --> 01:23:43,069
Tightly now.
Put your fist well through the bars.

833
01:23:43,154 --> 01:23:48,467
Cold iron will spoil everything.
I take your fist gently, like this.

834
01:23:48,554 --> 01:23:51,864
Open the door.
Be quick about it.

835
01:23:55,914 --> 01:24:00,192
Get in. Get down under there,
close to the wall.

836
01:24:00,274 --> 01:24:02,663
And not a sound.

837
01:24:08,034 --> 01:24:10,832
Close the door.

838
01:24:10,914 --> 01:24:13,348
Hide this in your robe.

839
01:24:13,434 --> 01:24:15,948
Sit down.

840
01:24:17,394 --> 01:24:23,026
And now, you will behold the result
of your rebellious plans. Come in.

841
01:24:30,954 --> 01:24:34,742
Here is Zorro the fox, safely trapped.

842
01:24:34,834 --> 01:24:36,950
Diego!
What is this?

843
01:24:38,594 --> 01:24:40,824
What idiotic joke is this?

844
01:24:40,914 --> 01:24:44,190
- As if you didn't know.
- Luis Quintero, you are a fool.

845
01:24:44,274 --> 01:24:47,903
Zorro is a man. This is my worthless,
trick-playing offspring.

846
01:24:49,234 --> 01:24:51,065
Have you seen this one, Father?

847
01:24:56,154 --> 01:24:59,544
Help!
Zorro is loose.

848
01:25:10,354 --> 01:25:14,142
- Senores, are you with me?
- I am with you.

849
01:26:24,194 --> 01:26:26,503
God, forgive me.

850
01:26:27,754 --> 01:26:29,870
God, forgive me.

851
01:27:22,274 --> 01:27:26,950
What a splendid audience you have.
Peons, caballeros, everyone.

852
01:27:27,034 --> 01:27:30,071
- It was thoughtful of you to have them here.
- Luis, what's happened?

853
01:27:30,154 --> 01:27:33,464
Good evening, ladies. You're just in time.
His Excellency is about to make an address.

854
01:27:33,554 --> 01:27:36,387
Address? What shall I say?

855
01:27:36,474 --> 01:27:40,183
You know.
The little matter of your resignation.

856
01:27:40,274 --> 01:27:44,347
Quiet!
Quiet for His Excellency.

857
01:27:46,354 --> 01:27:49,346
We're waiting. Go on.

858
01:27:53,714 --> 01:27:55,830
Good people of Los Angeles,

859
01:27:55,914 --> 01:28:01,750
owing to my ceaseless efforts
to improve conditions in the district...

860
01:28:03,594 --> 01:28:06,586
my health is endangered.

861
01:28:07,994 --> 01:28:13,307
I have therefore decided
to give up my office and go to Spain.

862
01:28:15,114 --> 01:28:21,792
To succeed me as alcalde of this district,
I am naming my illustrious predecessor,

863
01:28:21,874 --> 01:28:24,866
Don Alejandro Vega.

864
01:28:33,714 --> 01:28:39,664
And now, Your Excellency, I personally will
accompany you to the wharf at San Pedro.

865
01:28:39,754 --> 01:28:45,943
I wish to bless your voyage, and ask God
to reward you according to your merits.

866
01:28:48,154 --> 01:28:50,429
Spain...
Spain!

867
01:28:50,514 --> 01:28:54,905
Diego, when may we expect you
and our dear little Lolita in Madrid?

868
01:28:54,994 --> 01:28:59,670
- We'll follow the customs of California.
- What do you mean?

869
01:28:59,754 --> 01:29:04,669
We are going to marry, and raise fat children
and watch our vineyards grow.

870
