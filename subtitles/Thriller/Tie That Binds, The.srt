<i>Guan Lang Village</i>

3
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,870
This child.., doesn't he know how to clean up a little bit.

4
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:36,930
Excuse me. Is this Yow Tsyr's house?

5
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,820
You... are looking for Yow Tsyr? Anything I can help you with?

6
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,060
Is she here?

7
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,800
She went out.

8
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,700
Of course.

9
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,400
You are...

10
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,130
You must be Zhong Tien Yiu. Do you want t know

11
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,430
what your wife is doing right now?

12
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,740
If I didn't guess wrong,

13
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,900
You must be Tang Bai Bou's wife.

14
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,000
So you know your wife is with Tang Bai Bou.

15
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,920
It has been years. What is so surprising for old friends to meet up?

16
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,790
What about this. Why don't you come in and sit with me.

17
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,780
I think Yow Tsyr will be back soon.

18
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,610
I really don't understand.

19
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,230
Are you useless or are you pretend to be dumn?

20
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,800
You really don't care that they are together?

21
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,990
Ms. Tang,

22
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,880
we are old enough.

23
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,160
What haven't we seen the past 30 years?

24
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,840
Why would you still unsettle about things happened in the past?

25
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,000
Unsettle?

26
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,610
Zhong Tien Yiu, are you so useless and not able to restrain your wife?

27
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,500
Do you want me to be like you not able to restrain my husband?

28
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,950
Okay, I'll go find them myself.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,400
Ok, ok, off you go. I am busy so excuse me for not keeping you company.

30
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Wait

31
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,800
You still didn't tell me where they went.

32
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,800
H-How should I know where they went.

33
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,680
I can't believe you are so useless.

34
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,680
Okay, I'll go find them myself.

35
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,800
Be careful!

36
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,630

Dad, are you okay?!

38
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,880

Mom, are you okay?

44
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,800
Your dad...

45

Sorry, we have done our best.

46
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:48,850

You are all good kids.

50
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,300
Yow Tsyr, the person I worry the most

51
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,300

Yi Fan, Ke Ke.

55

Help me take care of your mom, okay?

56
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,490
Old man, why are you talking so much?

57
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,540
There is still me in the family. Don't worry.

58
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,220
It's fine, Dad, you talk less.

59
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,900
You should take a good rest here today.

60
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,740
Tomorrow, let's tell the doctor that we want to go home, ok?

61
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes.

62
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:55,600
Silly child. Everyone has to leave one day.

63
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,330
My Ke Ke and Yi Fan are all grown up.

64
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,800

00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:23,530
Promise me that you will take good care of your Mom.

68

00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,760
Don't talk any more.

Yow Tsyr, I really didn't do it on purpose.

99
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,900
This is all my fault.

100
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,100
For 30 years now, I have always want to bring it to an end.

101
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,060
I didn't imagine it will end like this.

102
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:16,530
As a matter of fact, since we all have our own family,

103
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,330
we already let go of the past.

<i>♫ You holding me so tight, there is no disguise ♫</i>

163
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,200
<i>♫ I am longing to feel ♫</i>

164
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,600
<i>Now you know how to play hopscotch, right?</i>

165
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,000
<i>Yes.</i>

166
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,600
<i>- Let's go play. - Ok.</i>

167
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,700
<i>I was little, after school,</i>

168
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,400
<i>my parents didn't come pick me up.</i>

169
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:52,600
<i>I sat on the swing just like now, swing back and forth.</i>

170
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,500
<i>I saw a lot of kids playing games on the playground.</i>

171
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,200
<i>Gradually, there were less kids.</i>

172
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,100
<i>But I was never afraid.</i>

173
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,600
<i>At that time,</i>

174
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,000
<i>there doesn't seem to be any trouble at all.</i>

175
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,700
<i>It is truly beautiful here.</i>

176
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,600
<i>Yes, it is beautiful.</i>

177
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:24,990
<i>It is as beautiful as our encounter.</i>

178
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,000
<i>Leave me more beautiful memories.</i>

179
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,500
<i>So when I think of you,</i>

180
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,500
<i>my heart will be warm.</i>

181
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,500
<i>I like to cook for you.</i>

182
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,700
<i>I like you to remember the taste.</i>

183
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,400
<i>Did you remember the restaurant we ate when we first met?</i>

184
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,200
<i>How could I forget?</i>

185
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,100
<i>Back then, you were so arrogant. It mortified you to ask you to eat that meal.</i>

186
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,000
<i>It was all your fault what happened that day.</i>

187
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,100
<i>Why?</i>

188
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:15,300
<i>My stomach has been very sensitive since I was little. I would suffer from diarrhea if I eat anything unclean.</i>

189
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800
<i>So that day...</i>

190
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,700
<i>I throw up and had diarrhea for 3 days.</i>

191
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,500
<i>Why did you eat then?</i>

192
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:30,000
<i>Don't mention little food stand. Even if you ask me to eat poison, I would.</i>

193
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
<i>I will eat everything you cook today. Everything will go into my belly.</i>

194
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,580
<i>I like to ask you a question.</i>

195
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,100
<i>What question?</i>

196
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,400
<i>When did you start liking me?</i>

197
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,500
<i>You guess.</i>

198
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,800
<i>I can't.</i>

199
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,600
<i>Then I won't tell you.</i>

200
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
<i>Are you going to tell me?</i>

201
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,900
<i>The moment when I saw you.</i>

202
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,900
<i>Really?</i>

203
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,400
<i>What about you?</i>

204
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,800
<i>When did you start loving me?</i>

205
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,500
<i>Me, too.</i>

206
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,900
<i>Ke Ke, which is the pole star?</i>

207
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,400
<i>Don't know.</i>

208
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,400
<i>Fine, I admit I don't know any of the stars in the sky.</i>

209
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,500
<i>Zhong Ke Ke. I have always want to tell you.</i>

210
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,400
<i>Could you be more un-romantic?</i>

211
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,600
<i>What?</i>

212
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,800
<i>You are the least romantic girl I ever met.</i>

213
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,800
<i>Every time.</i>

214
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,800
<i>What about this. Is it romantic?</i>

215
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,000
<i>Not bad.</i>

216
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,700
<i>Remember you have promised me.</i>

217
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,800
<i>You will be happy.</i>

218
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:19,600
<i>Thank you. I am satisfied now that I had this day.</i>

219
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,600
Sorry, I got here so late.

220
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,800
Mom, you are looking for us?

221
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:36,400
Yi Fan, I have been thinking. You two should return to the city.

222
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,400
Shao Yin love to dance, You can't let her give up her dream.

223
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,100
Mom, we are here to talk about this with you.

224
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,800
Shao Yin decide to stay here to help us with the business here.

225
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:55,500
Once Dong Dong is healed, we will bring him back here to stay with you.

226
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,800
But Shao Yin... you are not going to dance any more?

227
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,200
Auntie, I have think about it.

228
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:11,400
All these years, I have been out on my own going after something so called, the dream.

229
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,100
I have not taken good care of Dong Dong and didn't get him a good father.

230
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,200
Finally I found my happiness.

231
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,700
I am not going to let it go.

232
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:30,300
I just want to take good care of you and live a good life together as a family, alright?

233
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,400
Thank you! Thanks!

234
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,300
Thank you, my son.

235
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,000
You found a good wife for the family.

236
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,400
Thank you, Yi Fan.

237
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,300
Yang Ming, why are you doing eating? Eat what you like.

238
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,900
Auntie, you are too formal.

239
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:19,300
Mom, you don't need to treat him like a outsider.

240
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,700
Here, eat the carb.

241
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,400
Yang Ming,

242
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:30,200
even if my cooking is not good, I am sure it will taste pretty good to you.

243
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Because you know Auntie is very good to you and treat you with my heart.

244
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,300
Auntie, please don't say that. I know you are an excellent cook.

245
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,500
In fact, falling in love is the same theory.

246
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,100
Ke Ke, after experience so much,

247
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,200
Mom like to tell you one thing.

248
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,700
No matter what decision you made,

249
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,200
Mom will be on your side.

250
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,400
But, you can't

251
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,000
avoid seeing how nice the other people have been to you, understand?

252
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,900
Mom, eat.

253
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,300
Mom, Yang Ming and I are getting married.

254
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,300
What are you talking about?

255
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,000
Why? You don't believe me?

256
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:34,500
Is it so unbelievable? It's making me really unwilling now.

257
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,600
You.. Are you serious?

258
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
Is there fake marriage?

259
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,800
Mom, you should think of a good date next month.

260
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,800
This... We still have to get the invitation ready as well as the guest list.

261
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:53,900
There are so many thing to work out. My head is going to explode just thinking of it. So many things.

262
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,800
Freeze? Eat!

263
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,000
You should eat some crab.

264
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,300
You eat too. Yang Ming, eat some.

265
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:12,890
Yang Ming, eat more. Eat more.

266
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,100
Just.. Sorry.

267
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,700
Do you have nothing else to say to me?

268
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,300
Auntie said that under that circumstances, I can understand.

269
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:11,200
But, if she believe you and force you into marriage...

270
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,600
What are you going to do?

271
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,900
Are you welling to marry me?

272
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,900
I... I say sorry earlier was not because

273
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,650
I use you to putting my Mom off.

274
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,700
It is because I told my Mom before asking you.

275
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,920
I didn't know if you are (willing to marry me.)

276
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:43,800
S-So what you mean is

277
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,000
You're willing to marry me?

278
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,200
You know about my past.

279
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:03,800
You understand me better than anyone else. You know me better than anyone else.

280
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:09,300
If you are welling to accept a wounded person,

281
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,800
Then let's get married.

282
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,900
I am willing.

283
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,300
I've always waited for this day to come.

284
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,100
Even though...

285
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,300
I didn't think I have much hope.

286
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:36,300
But I like to tell you that I am willing and I truly am willing.

287
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,900
I will work very hard to be a good wife.

288
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:48,500
I will use the rest of my live to repay the good you place upon me.

289
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,300
Do you know?

290
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,100
In fact, right now I

291
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,000
really feel like I am dreaming.

292
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:10,380
But no matter what. at this moment, you are making me really happy.

293
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,800
We will all be happy in the future.

294
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,900
Auntie, don't see us to the door. We will leave directly from here.

295
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,500
You are still calling me Auntie.

296
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,890
Mom, don't walk us to the door.

297
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:58,470
Yang Ming, make sure you book the restaurant right away for the date we have agreed upon.

298
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,500
Sure, we know that, Mom.

299
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:07,200
I wonder if it is too late. Everyone said the engagement party is quite important.

300
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,400
No worries. Success all depends on human effort anyway.

301
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:17,000
Actually, we only want to share our happiness with our relatives and friends so no need to go all out and waste money.

302
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:24,200
Yang Ming, I am marrying my precious daughter to you.

303
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:29,700
Mom, don't worry. I'll take good care of Ke Ke from now on.

304
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,800
Yang Ming, as a buddy, I like to give you a warning.

305
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,700
Don't treat her too nice or you are in trouble.

306
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,800
What kind of brother saying this kind of stuff?

307
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,300
I am just telling the truth.

308
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,400
Fine. We are leaving.

309
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,800
Okay, be careful on the road.

310
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,800
We're leaving. - Okay, take care of mom.

311
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,100
Don't worry.

312
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:24,200
Okay, okay, okay. Congratulations, congratulations, congratulations.

313
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:30,000
Good date! Good date!

314
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,300
Ke Ke, you are not a good friend.

315
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,300
True, Director. So sudden. You are getting married!

316
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,000
Yes, so sudden.

317
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,900
I also feel it is very sudden myself.

318
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,000
You guys just have to come.

319
