1
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:56,912
Leon put 'em on the same squad.
Don't get me wrong. I love the 49ers.

2
00:01:57,006 --> 00:02:00,291
Montana and Rice?
They're Hall of Fame locks, baby.

3
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:02,840
But do they cover the spread?

4
00:02:02,928 --> 00:02:05,550
Hell, no. Not like the Giants.

5
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:09,223
Let me tell you something.
You can give me Simms and Bavaro,

6
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,682
Meggett and LT, any damn day.

7
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,724
Those guys are your meat and potatoes.
They cover, baby.

8
00:02:14,814 --> 00:02:18,764
And don't even bring up Miami.
Don't bring 'em up. There's nothin' in Miami.

9
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,478
Miami only has Marino with the
golden arm and some fat cheerleaders.

10
00:02:22,572 --> 00:02:27,482
They have no running game. It's like
two virgins. Can't find the damn hole.

11
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:31,446
That's why they get blitzed
all the damn time. Understand?

12
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,115
I can't believe you guys.

13
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:38,872
I mean, yeah, they put up a ton of points,
but they only cover every other week.

14
00:02:38,963 --> 00:02:42,248
Take the over, then bet
the fuckin' farm, you understand?

15
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:48,379
The pigs, the barn, the little chickens and
that raggedy-ass tractor. Bet all of that.

16
00:02:48,555 --> 00:02:52,304
- Dallas, America's team? My sweet black ass.
- Come on.

17
00:02:52,392 --> 00:02:55,595
Tried the bookie-fuckin' routine, right?

18
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:59,138
Everybody and their wrinkled
grandmother wanna bet the Cowboys.

19
00:02:59,232 --> 00:03:04,392
Therefore, they gotta win by two touchdowns
just to cover. What are the odds on that?

20
00:03:04,487 --> 00:03:07,938
So do me a favour. Take the points and run.

21
00:03:08,241 --> 00:03:09,948
Come on, guys.

22
00:03:10,951 --> 00:03:14,036
Unless you are a moron, retarded Saints fan,

23
00:03:14,413 --> 00:03:17,450
therefore you deserve
to get cornholed on the 50-yard line.

24
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:21,242
- America's sport, baby. Football.
- I hate football.

25
00:03:21,337 --> 00:03:25,002
You're talkin' about my sport.
I can do any bet.

26
00:03:25,883 --> 00:03:27,958
One minute, fellas.

27
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:31,591
It's ShowTime.

28
00:03:37,143 --> 00:03:39,017
OK. Let's do it.

29
00:03:46,235 --> 00:03:48,062
It's a nasty habit.

30
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:02,032
Go.

31
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:22,391
Everybody down on the ground.

32
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:26,972
- Hands above your heads.
- Move.

33
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,853
You want me to use this thing?
What are you lookin' at?

34
00:04:32,613 --> 00:04:34,689
- How long?
- Two minutes.

35
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:44,451
I see you, baby.
Get your ass out here.

36
00:04:46,876 --> 00:04:48,287
Bingo.

37
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,260
- 1798.
- That was a bad year.

38
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:05,973
It's 90 seconds.

39
00:05:11,983 --> 00:05:14,143
Got it.

40
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,317
Upstairs.

41
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:31,083
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's estate junk.

42
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,871
One minute.

43
00:05:37,508 --> 00:05:41,043
- It's not here.
- It's there.

44
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:54,430
All right, 45.

45
00:05:54,525 --> 00:05:57,016
My God.

46
00:06:01,615 --> 00:06:03,773
30 seconds.

47
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:09,736
OK. Come on.

48
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:57,701
Break out the diamond.
Let's see that $10 million red beauty.

49
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,085
Fuckin' right.

50
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,930
The Surgeon General was right.
Cigarettes can kill.

51
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,259
No. Go back.

52
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,018
- Is there a problem?
- Fucking go back!

53
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:21,830
The psychodynamics of compulsive stealing
are well established.

54
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:25,865
An act committed to relieve
a pre-existing state of guilt,

55
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:29,336
an attempt to harm an imagined enemy,

56
00:08:29,423 --> 00:08:34,250
or a form of revenge against those who have
deprived the person of something significant,

57
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:38,424
or somehow inflicted a narcissistic injury.

58
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:46,351
But stealing panties
from the girls' locker room...

59
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:50,018
There's nothing in there.

60
00:08:52,737 --> 00:08:55,856
I've never really been
a big fan of Freud's anyway.

61
00:08:57,325 --> 00:09:01,156
I don't know if I should say this.
I'm a professional.

62
00:09:01,245 --> 00:09:04,364
I won't say anything.

63
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:07,955
You promise to keep your word?

64
00:09:08,043 --> 00:09:13,962
OK. Well, you know, that thing
that you were doing with the panties?

65
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:18,047
Everybody does it.
Your best friends do it.

66
00:09:18,135 --> 00:09:22,465
The mailman does it.
Even the headmaster. They all whack off.

67
00:09:22,557 --> 00:09:26,305
If anybody tells you they don't, they're lying.

68
00:09:27,228 --> 00:09:31,605
My mom says I'm oversexed.

69
00:09:53,503 --> 00:09:56,669
- Hi, Daddy.
- Excuse me. Who am I speaking to?

70
00:09:57,048 --> 00:10:00,251
- This is me.
- No, my Jessie is eight years old.

71
00:10:00,343 --> 00:10:02,881
The girl I am talking to is at least 11.

72
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:06,509
Can I speak to your mother, please?

73
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:10,517
- Don't forget the turkey.
- Why not have 'em deliver it?

74
00:10:10,603 --> 00:10:14,138
It's Thanksgiving eve, Nathan.
Might as well get it to fly here.

75
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:17,683
OK. Fairway, right?
What's the cross street? 74th?

76
00:10:17,776 --> 00:10:20,730
The man's a steel trap.

77
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:23,905
- I will be there in ten minutes.
- All right. Bye.

78
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:34,283
Go away.

79
00:10:40,548 --> 00:10:42,624
Come on.

80
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:46,261
Shit.

81
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:37,765
Louis, this better be a real emergency.

82
00:11:37,853 --> 00:11:39,928
My hero. Look.

83
00:11:41,064 --> 00:11:45,192
She's not one of your Dalton trust fund
waifs, but I think she needs your help.

84
00:11:45,277 --> 00:11:51,065
I don't know, Louis. I don't talk to you for
days, and the night before Thanksgiving...

85
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:54,775
- Jesus Christ.
- Lucky guy. He's still alive.

86
00:11:54,869 --> 00:11:57,111
She took a razor to an orderly in Rockland.

87
00:11:57,205 --> 00:11:59,992
- 111 stitches to close him up.
- What was the trigger?

88
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,869
Good question.
Been in institutions for ten years.

89
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,538
Yeah, I see that. Selective mutism,
obsessive-compulsive behaviour...

90
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:12,044
- Post-traumatic symptoms...
- 20 different hospitals and 20 diagnoses.

91
00:12:12,136 --> 00:12:16,714
An IQ off the charts. Saw her father
killed by a subway when she was eight.

92
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:18,883
- Dr Sachs?
- What?

93
00:12:18,976 --> 00:12:22,843
The girl who was biting the heads
off pigeons has a med student in a headlock.

94
00:12:22,938 --> 00:12:26,022
Call security. Make sure
the student documents the attack.

95
00:12:26,107 --> 00:12:28,943
Louis, I don't know
what the hell you want from me.

96
00:12:29,026 --> 00:12:33,439
- Look, I got a family at home, waiting.
- Nathan, spend 15 minutes with her.

97
00:12:33,531 --> 00:12:36,982
She's an 18-year-old girl
who never hurt a fly until last week.

98
00:12:37,076 --> 00:12:40,575
You and I are between her
and a lifetime on Thorazine. Or worse.

99
00:12:40,663 --> 00:12:44,412
What do you mean, ''you and I''?
She's your patient. Your case.

100
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,367
You're a big asshole for making me say this.

101
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,250
You're better at this stuff than I am.

102
00:12:53,341 --> 00:12:56,343
Everybody knows
Nathan Conrad's touch with the teens.

103
00:12:56,428 --> 00:13:01,423
Elisabeth Burrows is the kind of case you and
I lived for before you went uptown on me.

104
00:13:01,516 --> 00:13:04,221
Just kidding. I didn't mean it that way.

105
00:13:07,063 --> 00:13:09,435
- She needs you.
- All right.

106
00:13:09,524 --> 00:13:11,516
But why the emergency? Why tonight?

107
00:13:11,609 --> 00:13:13,685
If we don't make progress by Monday,

108
00:13:13,778 --> 00:13:18,356
they're gonna ship her to Creedmore
and chain her to a bed for the rest of her life.

109
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:23,241
That's why she needs you now. Five minutes.

110
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:29,705
- Arnie, Frankie, good evening.
- Dr Conrad. Slumming tonight?

111
00:13:29,793 --> 00:13:32,794
- Afraid so.
- You guys up for a cavity search?

112
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,213
I'll pass, but you know Dr Sachs.
He's always ready for one.

113
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,875
Mind the gate.

114
00:13:39,803 --> 00:13:41,961
What's the new cocktail?

115
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:44,131
Haldol, Droperidol and Ativan.

116
00:13:45,475 --> 00:13:47,882
- And she's awake?
- Yes, my friend.

117
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:51,477
- He told me to stay. You're making a mistake.
- Come on.

118
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:55,727
- She eating?
- Not eating, drinking, sleeping, bathing,

119
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:59,566
letting anybody touch her, or saying a word.

120
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:02,193
- You're making a mistake.
- No, sweetheart.

121
00:14:02,283 --> 00:14:04,358
Dr Sachs, he told me to stay.

122
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:08,366
I will have a word with him, Louise.
I promise.

123
00:14:12,793 --> 00:14:14,951
What's with the heavy artillery?

124
00:14:15,962 --> 00:14:20,671
It took about five guys
to get her off the poor fella up in Rockland.

125
00:14:25,221 --> 00:14:28,341
Louis, is there
anything else you wanna tell me?

126
00:14:28,725 --> 00:14:30,800
No.

127
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:35,560
Could you open the door, please?

128
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:39,309
- You OK?
- Am I OK?

129
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:41,690
- Yeah.
- I'm OK.

130
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:14,681
Hello.

131
00:15:17,604 --> 00:15:20,060
Elisabeth, my name is Dr Conrad.

132
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,976
I'm a psychiatrist.

133
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:28,022
Word has it
that you haven't eaten for days.

134
00:15:28,114 --> 00:15:30,191
I can understand that.

135
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:34,067
I used to work in this hospital.
I know what the food's like.

136
00:15:42,753 --> 00:15:45,790
Elisabeth, would you mind
if I took your pulse?

137
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:50,958
That means I'm gonna have to touch you.

138
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,055
Now, that's not supposed to happen.

139
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:47,345
True catatonics have what's called
a ''waxy flexibility'' of their limbs.

140
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,560
It means they stay
exactly where they're posed.

141
00:16:52,654 --> 00:16:55,690
There's more to you
than meets the eye, Elisabeth.

142
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,403
You're very good at what you do.

143
00:17:03,748 --> 00:17:06,618
So, is there anything you wanna talk about?

144
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,877
That's OK. We hardly know each other.

145
00:17:22,182 --> 00:17:26,974
I know you must have been very frightened
to do what you did to that guy.

146
00:17:27,854 --> 00:17:31,603
I know that you were angry,
because I saw those photos.

147
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:36,643
But I also know that you were in a lot of pain,

148
00:17:36,737 --> 00:17:40,605
because nobody is
in this place without a reason.

149
00:17:43,202 --> 00:17:45,693
So maybe we'll talk next week.

150
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,046
You want what they want.

151
00:17:56,715 --> 00:17:59,040
Don't you?

152
00:18:02,721 --> 00:18:05,508
What who wants?

153
00:18:10,395 --> 00:18:13,728
Elisabeth. What who wants?

154
00:18:15,066 --> 00:18:17,307
I'll never tell.

155
00:18:22,531 --> 00:18:24,654
Any of you.

156
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,924
Hello?

157
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:36,300
Who are you?

158
00:19:44,527 --> 00:19:48,987
Five to three this old bag doesn't have cable.
I need my sports.

159
00:19:56,413 --> 00:19:58,738
Dinner's over.

160
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:12,791
- How you doin', Tony?
- Good. Nice to see you, Doctor.

161
00:20:26,776 --> 00:20:28,851
Hello?

162
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:34,527
This certainly looks like
the Conrad residence.

163
00:20:36,243 --> 00:20:39,991
It smells like the Conrad residence.

164
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:47,414
And it's definitely overheated,
like the Conrad residence.

165
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,918
But it doesn't sound
like the Conrad residence.

166
00:20:55,261 --> 00:20:59,721
Hi, honey. I'm looking for a little girl.

167
00:21:00,807 --> 00:21:04,058
About four feet two, light brown hair.

168
00:21:09,107 --> 00:21:11,017
Where did she go?

169
00:21:14,821 --> 00:21:17,312
If I don't find that little girl,

170
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:22,531
I'm gonna have to go downstairs
and find myself another little girl.

171
00:21:24,663 --> 00:21:27,415
I'll be back in ten minutes.

172
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:33,754
- Hi, Daddy.
- How are you?

173
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:38,382
- Look what I did in art class today.
- That's beautiful. Look at the colours.

174
00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:42,336
- You've got such a unique vision.
- It's my vision, I swear.

175
00:21:42,722 --> 00:21:46,720
- Aren't you supposed to be in bed?
- I can't sleep. I have mental problems.

176
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:50,345
- I see. What kind of mental problems?
- I'm highly neurotic.

177
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:54,472
- I think you've been in my study again.
- I needed the stapler.

178
00:21:54,568 --> 00:21:57,604
- Go say good night to Mom.
- You're late.

179
00:21:57,696 --> 00:22:00,696
- Good night, Mommy.
- Night, baby. You brush your teeth?

180
00:22:00,781 --> 00:22:03,237
- Yeah.
- Can I smell?

181
00:22:03,326 --> 00:22:04,784
Delicious.

182
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:08,072
I'll put Monkey right over here
by you on that side.

183
00:22:08,164 --> 00:22:11,284
And I'll put Sally over here
to keep you company.

184
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,292
You had a bad day.

185
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:20,797
- Why do you say that?
- Frown-face.

186
00:22:20,885 --> 00:22:25,796
I have a ''frown-face'' because it's
after ten o'clock and you're still awake.

187
00:22:26,974 --> 00:22:29,891
Where were you tonight?

188
00:22:29,976 --> 00:22:32,218
I was working.

189
00:22:32,312 --> 00:22:34,470
Why?

190
00:22:34,564 --> 00:22:37,932
Because I was helping a young girl.

191
00:22:39,444 --> 00:22:42,564
All right. But that's gonna cost ya.

192
00:22:43,531 --> 00:22:46,734
All right. What's it gonna be?

193
00:22:46,826 --> 00:22:50,574
One hug, two kisses.

194
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:55,666
You cut a tough deal.
OK, here's one hug.

195
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,834
And one kiss.

196
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,997
And two kisses.

197
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:06,506
Will they put Bart Simpson in the parade?

198
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:11,138
They will put Bart Simpson
in the parade ifyou go to sleep right now.

199
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:15,182
OK. But I don't think they'll care
if I go to sleep or not.

200
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:22,064
- Good night, sweetheart. I love you.
- Love you too.

201
00:23:59,728 --> 00:24:02,302
- Let me give you a hand, Detective.
- Thanks.

202
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:04,474
That's beautiful.

203
00:24:06,902 --> 00:24:09,571
What exactly is beautiful?

204
00:24:09,655 --> 00:24:13,403
- Your leatherjacket. It's beautiful.
- Right.

205
00:24:15,577 --> 00:24:18,151
- Did you read about the Manhattan Bridge?
- No.

206
00:24:18,247 --> 00:24:21,912
It was built wrong. It moves ten feet.

207
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,574
- Syd Simon.
- I'll see you later.

208
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:28,453
- Detective Cassidy, what can I do for you?
- What do we got?

209
00:24:28,548 --> 00:24:31,121
Floater. Female, no ID.

210
00:24:31,217 --> 00:24:33,708
She's maybe in her twenties.

211
00:24:35,763 --> 00:24:39,808
Sloughing of her skin tells me
she's been in the water two, three days.

212
00:24:39,892 --> 00:24:43,308
This time of year,
with the water cold, could be longer.

213
00:24:43,396 --> 00:24:45,352
A couple to three days tops.

214
00:24:51,486 --> 00:24:55,021
Her hands have been tied.
They recover any rope or anything?

215
00:24:55,115 --> 00:24:57,191
They're still lookin'.

216
00:25:00,036 --> 00:25:02,907
Another body was found
a couple of days ago.

217
00:25:02,998 --> 00:25:04,990
- Battery Park area?
- Yeah.

218
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:08,582
The victim was male, middle-aged.
Day before yesterday.

219
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:14,505
- I need preliminary findings by tonight.
- Dream on, Detective. I got cases piled up.

220
00:25:14,592 --> 00:25:19,883
C'mon, Syd. I got plans for
Thanksgiving. Do me right, all right?

221
00:25:19,972 --> 00:25:22,641
- Tomorrow's the best I can do.
- Thank you.

222
00:25:22,725 --> 00:25:25,180
First thing, though.

223
00:25:34,236 --> 00:25:37,439
Cars have now been towed,
the roads ploughed to the pavements,

224
00:25:37,531 --> 00:25:41,445
so the annual Turkey Trot,
the 8,000-metre race...

225
00:25:41,535 --> 00:25:43,860
8,000-metre race? That doesn't sound right.

226
00:25:43,953 --> 00:25:45,911
You can't be distracted.

227
00:25:47,874 --> 00:25:51,408
Here you are, immobile,

228
00:25:56,173 --> 00:25:59,293
totally exposed,

229
00:25:59,385 --> 00:26:02,136
and quite vulnerable.

230
00:26:04,932 --> 00:26:07,138
I think you need a bath.

231
00:26:07,226 --> 00:26:10,594
Guess what, sweetie.
I already had a bath today.

232
00:26:10,687 --> 00:26:12,597
You did?

233
00:26:13,023 --> 00:26:19,393
You didn't have Nathan Conrad's
fantastic special bath, did you?

234
00:26:19,487 --> 00:26:21,278
- No.
- No, you didn't do that.

235
00:26:21,364 --> 00:26:23,523
I didn't get that one yet.

236
00:26:24,743 --> 00:26:27,233
Pretty hot. Not too hot, is it?

237
00:26:27,328 --> 00:26:29,405
- No. It's nice.
- Good.

238
00:26:41,884 --> 00:26:45,833
- We should keep it down.
- You're the one that makes the noise.

239
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:40,396
Prepare to die of delight.

240
00:27:41,525 --> 00:27:44,560
Jessie, c'mon. Let's join the downhill racer.

241
00:27:49,574 --> 00:27:51,862
I heard that about the downhill racer.

242
00:27:51,951 --> 00:27:54,572
Honey, you were dreaming.
I didn't say anything.

243
00:27:54,662 --> 00:27:57,366
- It was icy, you know?
- I know it was, baby.

244
00:27:57,456 --> 00:28:00,161
- And very windy, too.
- It was a hell-ride.

245
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:03,997
- Good morning.
- Morning. You think she's still sleeping?

246
00:28:04,088 --> 00:28:06,246
I don't know.

247
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:10,005
Jessie? Come on.
The parade's gonna start soon.

248
00:28:14,347 --> 00:28:17,134
All right. I'm gonna go there all by myself.

249
00:28:18,351 --> 00:28:20,427
See all those floats alone.

250
00:28:25,024 --> 00:28:28,393
Jessie, come on. Breakfast is getting cold.

251
00:28:29,111 --> 00:28:31,685
Does she have a new hiding place
I don't know?

252
00:28:31,781 --> 00:28:36,489
Probably. She's been running round
the house like a wildcat all week.

253
00:28:36,577 --> 00:28:40,076
Jessie. Get in here right now.

254
00:28:40,164 --> 00:28:42,239
Eat it up before it gets cold.

255
00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:47,211
Nathan? She wouldn't
go out on the balcony, right?

256
00:29:14,613 --> 00:29:18,990
She's not there. She knows better than
to go outside without asking, doesn't she?

257
00:29:19,075 --> 00:29:21,400
Jessie. Get in here right now.

258
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,065
- She lost one of her socks.
- What?

259
00:29:59,114 --> 00:30:01,783
- She's gone.
- What do you mean?

260
00:30:02,826 --> 00:30:05,364
- Wait. Where is she?
- Somebody came in.

261
00:30:05,454 --> 00:30:08,454
- No. She's in the hallway...
- Somebody took her.

262
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:12,869
- Nobody took her, Nathan.
- Aggie, they cut the chain on the door.

263
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,630
What? Nathan, call the police.

264
00:30:18,842 --> 00:30:21,000
I can't get a dial tone. Hello?

265
00:30:21,094 --> 00:30:25,173
Get off the line. This is an emergency.
Something's wrong with the phone.

266
00:30:25,264 --> 00:30:28,597
- There is nothing wrong with it, Nathan.
- This is an emergency.

267
00:30:28,684 --> 00:30:30,891
Yeah, I know.

268
00:30:33,981 --> 00:30:36,388
- Who is this?
- We have your daughter.

269
00:30:39,569 --> 00:30:42,606
- What?
- Who is it?

270
00:30:42,698 --> 00:30:45,698
What's your worst fear, Nathan?

271
00:30:46,617 --> 00:30:50,662
- My what?
- The first shock can buckle the knees. True?

272
00:30:50,747 --> 00:30:53,949
- Where is she?
- She's unharmed. I don't want to hurther.

273
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:57,492
- Give it to me.
- I want something from you.

274
00:30:58,587 --> 00:30:59,868
- No.
- What?

275
00:30:59,964 --> 00:31:05,171
Not until I talk to my daughter
and I know that she's OK.

276
00:31:05,261 --> 00:31:09,175
Rule number one. You do not make demands.
You listen to what I tell you.

277
00:31:09,265 --> 00:31:12,764
You call me back
when I can talk to my daughter.

278
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:17,474
- What the hell were you doing?
- Aggie.

279
00:31:17,564 --> 00:31:21,561
- Listen to me, Aggie.
- No. Are you crazy?

280
00:31:22,861 --> 00:31:25,815
Aggie. I have to make sure she's all right.

281
00:31:26,156 --> 00:31:28,279
What if they don't call back?

282
00:31:36,082 --> 00:31:38,288
- Hello?
- Daddy?

283
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:42,373
- Jessie, are you OK, sweetie?
- Honey, have they hurt you?

284
00:31:42,463 --> 00:31:45,416
No. Daddy, can I come home now? Daddy?

285
00:31:48,302 --> 00:31:50,377
That was very brave, Nathan.

286
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,338
- Tell me how much money you want.
- I don't want your money.

287
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:57,220
Pick up your wife
before she breaks the other leg.

288
00:31:59,479 --> 00:32:01,637
I'm fine.

289
00:32:05,569 --> 00:32:07,691
What?

290
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:09,855
Nathan, what is it?

291
00:32:13,743 --> 00:32:17,158
Don't close the curtains. I like the view.

292
00:32:18,122 --> 00:32:22,748
Good. Now, on the bureau
by the door is a cellphone.

293
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:25,372
I know what you're thinking. Don't.

294
00:32:25,713 --> 00:32:29,128
By the time you hit
the one in ''911'' Jessie will be dead.

295
00:32:29,216 --> 00:32:34,720
Rule number two. Do not try to call or signal
anyone. If you do, I will kill your daughter.

296
00:32:34,804 --> 00:32:39,182
Not because I want to, but because
those are the rules. Do you understand?

297
00:32:39,268 --> 00:32:41,343
- Yes.
- What?

298
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,935
I can see you. I can hear you.

299
00:32:47,024 --> 00:32:50,026
Wherever you go, you will be watched.

300
00:32:50,111 --> 00:32:52,648
- What are they saying?
- If you want to see her alive,

301
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:54,778
don't say a word.

302
00:32:54,866 --> 00:32:58,531
- Now, tell me you understand.
- I understand.

303
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:03,494
Good. You have a pro bono patient.
Her name is Elisabeth Burrows.

304
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:06,872
A very disturbed girl.

305
00:33:06,961 --> 00:33:09,747
She has a six-digit number in her head.

306
00:33:09,838 --> 00:33:13,836
Locked away in her troubled mind.
She guards it with her life.

307
00:33:14,134 --> 00:33:17,467
- What kind of number?
- That needn't concern you.

308
00:33:17,554 --> 00:33:22,014
I need that number. You need your daughter
back. That is why this is happening.

309
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,258
You're a professional, Nathan. So am I.

310
00:33:24,352 --> 00:33:26,843
If we do our jobs
to the best of our abilities,

311
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:31,149
by this time tomorrow it'll be like
we never even knew each other.

312
00:33:32,026 --> 00:33:38,064
Now, go back to Bridgeview. Take the Rover.

313
00:33:38,365 --> 00:33:43,406
No police, no detours.
And Nathan? Aggie will be fine.

314
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:50,668
Rule number three.
You have until 5pm today.

315
00:33:59,803 --> 00:34:02,210
Let's do exactly what he says.

316
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:08,223
- Nathan, why don't we call the police?
- Because we can't.

317
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,848
Because I believe him.

318
00:35:01,612 --> 00:35:04,067
Happy Thanksgiving.

319
00:35:11,371 --> 00:35:12,699
Asshole.

320
00:35:12,789 --> 00:35:17,201
- Aren't you and Jessie hittin' the parade?
- She's got a cold, Danny.

321
00:35:33,434 --> 00:35:36,138
No signs of sexual assault.

322
00:35:36,228 --> 00:35:39,099
I see evidence of injury in her neck.

323
00:35:39,189 --> 00:35:43,602
Signs of bleeding in the
strap muscles overlying her larynx.

324
00:35:43,693 --> 00:35:47,276
I don't know, Syd. This girl
does not match any of my missing persons.

325
00:35:47,364 --> 00:35:52,025
Also evidence of a fracture
on the left tip of her hyoid bone.

326
00:35:52,118 --> 00:35:54,194
Syd. How'd she die?

327
00:35:54,287 --> 00:35:56,778
No blunt instrument here.

328
00:35:56,873 --> 00:35:59,744
- Her neck was snapped in two.
- By what?

329
00:36:01,335 --> 00:36:04,253
By two hands.

330
00:36:06,256 --> 00:36:10,670
Syd. Same technique used
on this Battery Park floater?

331
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:20,136
Same dislocation of the skull.

332
00:36:20,229 --> 00:36:22,801
And the splotches on the body?

333
00:36:22,897 --> 00:36:26,349
Cigarette burns. He was tortured.

334
00:36:26,442 --> 00:36:28,850
And he had prison tats? OK.

335
00:36:28,945 --> 00:36:33,653
I'm also gonna need fingerprints
and dental x-rays on our Jane Doe, pronto.

336
00:36:33,741 --> 00:36:35,818
You know this is Thanksgiving?

337
00:36:37,912 --> 00:36:40,403
You're right.

338
00:36:41,207 --> 00:36:45,749
Hope her family isn't waiting on her
to carve the turkey.

339
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:51,123
Cassidy, I'm not susceptible
to your guilty-me bullshit.

340
00:36:53,176 --> 00:36:56,426
She probably helped
her mom with the dishes.

341
00:37:02,852 --> 00:37:05,522
Fingerprints and dentals. Then I'm outta here.

342
00:37:05,605 --> 00:37:07,681
Thank you, Syd.

343
00:38:02,701 --> 00:38:04,907
Slow it down.

344
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:11,950
Come on.

345
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:37,433
Roll down your window, sir.

346
00:38:40,237 --> 00:38:42,859
- Officer, I'm a doctor.
- Congratulations.

347
00:38:42,948 --> 00:38:47,694
- See that tuba player rolling off your hood?
- I need to get through this parade.

348
00:38:47,995 --> 00:38:50,995
I need an escort to
the Bridgeview Psychiatric Hospital.

349
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:55,327
Do I look like a freakin' helicopter?
Use 57th Street like everyone else.

350
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:07,587
- He's talking to the cops. What do we do?
- Be patient.

351
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,172
There's a young girl who could die.

352
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:14,678
So, Officer, you can either
help me save this girl...

353
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:17,686
Or not.

354
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:24,860
Get outta here. Move on.
Can I have two of you?

355
00:39:24,947 --> 00:39:27,900
Let's go. Right over there.

356
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,453
Hold the band right there.

357
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:35,237
Open those gates for me, guys.

358
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:41,710
The son of a bitch. He just picked up
a police escort and cut through the parade.

359
00:40:10,365 --> 00:40:12,821
I like that.

360
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:16,492
- What?
- The police escort. I like it a lot.

361
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:21,241
- You didn't tell me the context of the number.
- She knows.

362
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:25,078
This girl has a decade
of pathology to unravel.

363
00:40:25,171 --> 00:40:29,584
Even if she knows,
your five o'clock deadline is absurd.

364
00:40:29,675 --> 00:40:33,755
In my experience, people are at their best
facing unreasonable deadlines.

365
00:40:33,845 --> 00:40:36,336
You can't just flick a switch in her head.

366
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:39,433
Trust me. It does not
work that way in these cases.

367
00:40:39,518 --> 00:40:44,263
The money's bad, I know.
But you have family obligations right now.

368
00:40:45,315 --> 00:40:47,889
And Nathan? Don't lose the phone.

369
00:41:36,698 --> 00:41:40,482
- The doctor has landed.
- Did he double-alarm the car?

370
00:41:40,577 --> 00:41:42,902
- Nope.
- Good. We gothim focused.

371
00:41:43,454 --> 00:41:46,289
- Do you have the key to Dr Sachs's office?
- Yeah.

372
00:41:46,374 --> 00:41:48,580
- Open it, please.
- But Dr Sachs isn't here.

373
00:41:48,667 --> 00:41:50,743
Open it.

374
00:42:54,772 --> 00:43:00,276
I thought Nathan explained the rules
very clearly. Put the cell phone back.

375
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,364
There's no percentage
in breaking those rules.

376
00:43:06,867 --> 00:43:08,943
You sick son of a bitch.

377
00:43:09,328 --> 00:43:13,242
- You hurt my little girl and I'll...
- You'll do what?

378
00:43:13,332 --> 00:43:16,166
You were about to say something personal.

379
00:43:16,251 --> 00:43:18,327
I think.

380
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,211
- No.
- That's good.

381
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:23,962
If your husband is on his game today,
you've nothing to worry about.

382
00:43:24,051 --> 00:43:29,970
There's a good side, Aggie. This will bring
you much closer than the occasional ski trip.

383
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,969
Orsponge bath.

384
00:43:34,477 --> 00:43:36,884
The remote is to your left. Pick it up.

385
00:43:38,022 --> 00:43:40,098
Pick it up.

386
00:43:43,277 --> 00:43:45,566
Good. Now turn it on.

387
00:43:49,367 --> 00:43:51,442
Try HBO.

388
00:43:56,206 --> 00:43:59,705
No. I've seen this. A bit too violent.

389
00:44:00,293 --> 00:44:02,784
Try a nice family drama.

390
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:55,132
- Nathan. What are you doin' here?
- You're not supposed to be here.

391
00:44:55,221 --> 00:44:59,300
- How'd you get in? Who let you in?
- You're supposed to be in Greenwich.

392
00:44:59,391 --> 00:45:01,514
Why are you here on Thanksgiving?

393
00:45:01,601 --> 00:45:05,849
Why am I here? I gotta testify
in a double homicide on Monday.

394
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,522
I thought I'd come to my office
to do a little research.

395
00:45:10,652 --> 00:45:13,938
You broke into my files.
Those are my pers...

396
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:18,075
- I would a given you the key, man.
- Have you gone through all of this?

397
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:23,580
No, it just got here. But I've been through the
master file. It's a swamp of misdiagnosis...

398
00:45:23,665 --> 00:45:26,784
- I think she's overlaying.
- Overlaying?

399
00:45:27,084 --> 00:45:31,129
She is a brilliant mimic.
That's why Rockland couldn't figure her out.

400
00:45:31,214 --> 00:45:35,258
She's highly adaptive. She takes on
the symptoms of other patients.

401
00:45:35,342 --> 00:45:38,178
She's like a counterfeit schizophrenic, maybe.

402
00:45:38,262 --> 00:45:40,753
I can't believe it's all smoke and mirrors.

403
00:45:40,848 --> 00:45:43,599
That would place her
in the malingerers' hall offame.

404
00:45:43,683 --> 00:45:46,768
I gotta believe there's
some genuine pathology beneath it.

405
00:45:46,854 --> 00:45:51,231
She has classic post-traumatic
stress symptoms. Her PTSD is real.

406
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:55,444
Seeing her father die, that was ground zero.

407
00:45:56,655 --> 00:46:02,159
And she also believes that
something or somebody is after her.

408
00:46:02,494 --> 00:46:08,579
That is why she stayed institutionalised these
past ten years. She wants to stay inside.

409
00:46:10,292 --> 00:46:13,377
So, 20 different hospitalisations,

410
00:46:14,547 --> 00:46:16,919
20 different diagnoses.

411
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:24,422
All overlaying. Nathan, that would make her
a very talented young lady, wouldn't it?

412
00:46:24,806 --> 00:46:26,882
Or desperate.

413
00:46:45,618 --> 00:46:48,109
- Louis?
- Yeah?

414
00:46:49,038 --> 00:46:53,581
Does anybody know I'm treating
Elisabeth Burrows besides you?

415
00:46:53,667 --> 00:46:56,833
Everybody. I put it up last night after you left.

416
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,087
Figured you might be back.
Wanted you to have clearance.

417
00:47:00,174 --> 00:47:03,293
I also reinstated your password. Gate, please.

418
00:47:22,153 --> 00:47:24,110
Elisabeth, good morning.

419
00:47:26,157 --> 00:47:28,730
Are you feeling better?

420
00:47:30,494 --> 00:47:33,246
I brought you something.

421
00:47:35,374 --> 00:47:37,865
A chocolate turkey.

422
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:43,167
The sugar'll help you metabolise
all those meds they've been giving you.

423
00:47:48,136 --> 00:47:52,004
Do you like Thanksgiving?
It's my favourite holiday.

424
00:48:03,025 --> 00:48:05,350
Wanna touch?

425
00:48:05,444 --> 00:48:08,564
- Sorry?
- I saw you looking.

426
00:48:08,864 --> 00:48:13,822
I know what you're trying to do.
You want to embarrass me. It won't work.

427
00:48:20,584 --> 00:48:22,826
The other doctor?

428
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,911
- Dr Sachs.
- Yeah.

429
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,919
- I don't like him.
- I can understand that.

430
00:48:33,137 --> 00:48:35,545
Very fucking funny.

431
00:48:36,807 --> 00:48:41,185
Elisabeth, there's something
important that I have to ask you.

432
00:48:44,398 --> 00:48:47,186
But first I wanna show you something.

433
00:48:47,276 --> 00:48:49,813
I have a daughter. She's eight.

434
00:48:50,946 --> 00:48:53,069
Going on 18.

435
00:48:54,283 --> 00:48:56,359
Her name's Jessie.

436
00:48:59,163 --> 00:49:02,412
I have some of her favourite things here.

437
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:05,824
This is Horton Hears a Who!

438
00:49:06,378 --> 00:49:10,043
I've read it to her so many times,
it's pretty worn by now.

439
00:49:15,637 --> 00:49:20,298
And this...
She loves to draw weird pictures of me.

440
00:49:37,324 --> 00:49:39,993
And this.

441
00:49:40,702 --> 00:49:43,324
This is Sally.

442
00:49:44,997 --> 00:49:46,872
Would you like one of those?

443
00:49:47,917 --> 00:49:51,251
I'll make sure the hospital lets you keep it.

444
00:49:51,337 --> 00:49:53,329
But you can only choose one.

445
00:49:53,422 --> 00:49:56,874
- What the hell is this? Toys ''R'' Us?
- Want me to choose for you?

446
00:50:11,565 --> 00:50:13,890
- Dr Conrad?
- Yes?

447
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:17,186
Get out.

448
00:50:19,406 --> 00:50:20,355
No.

449
00:50:20,449 --> 00:50:22,524
I want you to leave.

450
00:50:22,617 --> 00:50:25,369
No. We're not finished talking, Elisabeth.

451
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:28,443
I know what you're trying to do.

452
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:32,956
You wanna embarrass me. It won't work.

453
00:50:38,633 --> 00:50:41,586
What's your name?

454
00:50:43,638 --> 00:50:46,472
Your hair's really long.

455
00:50:49,602 --> 00:50:52,768
My hair used to be that long
but my mom made me cut it.

456
00:50:55,773 --> 00:50:58,525
What's that thing on your neck?

457
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:04,400
It's kind of impolite
not to answer someone's question.

458
00:51:08,202 --> 00:51:10,954
It's a symbol.

459
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:15,197
- What's it mean?
- Don't talk.

460
00:51:17,295 --> 00:51:20,959
Elisabeth, there's something I need to know.

461
00:51:21,048 --> 00:51:23,124
Jessie.

462
00:51:23,217 --> 00:51:25,673
Jessie? That's my little girl's name.

463
00:51:27,429 --> 00:51:29,754
Wanna see a picture that Jessie drew?

464
00:51:30,891 --> 00:51:35,636
I'll make you a deal. I'll show you
the picture if you answer my question.

465
00:51:36,562 --> 00:51:40,098
Is it worth just one answer?
I don't mean a yes or no answer.

466
00:51:41,859 --> 00:51:44,185
Maybe.

467
00:51:45,112 --> 00:51:48,030
I'm gonna ask my question now, Elisabeth.

468
00:51:48,116 --> 00:51:50,404
Is the man that you hurt in Rockland...

469
00:51:51,494 --> 00:51:56,286
Did that have anything to do with the terrible
thing that happened to you in the subway?

470
00:51:56,415 --> 00:51:58,823
Come on, run.

471
00:51:58,918 --> 00:52:01,206
Come on, honey, run.

472
00:52:06,049 --> 00:52:08,920
- I didn't know what you were talking about.
- Run.

473
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:12,011
I didn't know who ''they'' were
or what ''they'' wanted.

474
00:52:12,097 --> 00:52:15,133
- Now I do. I know how bad they wanted it.
- Leave.

475
00:52:15,225 --> 00:52:18,593
I know how important it was
for you to hold onto it.

476
00:52:18,686 --> 00:52:20,976
I'm just asking...

477
00:52:21,856 --> 00:52:24,940
Elizabeth, you have to...

478
00:52:35,995 --> 00:52:38,912
I'm sorry.

479
00:52:43,835 --> 00:52:45,912
You lost her.

480
00:52:46,005 --> 00:52:48,496
She's still got the doll, doesn't she?

481
00:53:16,909 --> 00:53:18,985
- Yeah?
- That went well.

482
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:25,287
I can gain her trust. But without
more information, I'm shooting in the dark.

483
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:29,455
- The answer's right in front of you.
- I have gone through her files.

484
00:53:29,879 --> 00:53:32,501
- Then look closer.
- You tell...

485
00:53:32,591 --> 00:53:35,793
Nathan. lt's 12.22.

486
00:53:40,556 --> 00:53:45,847
I'm sure of one thing. They would have
encountered quite a few venomous species.

487
00:53:47,646 --> 00:53:49,971
Like this. Check this out.

488
00:53:50,608 --> 00:53:54,273
See how he's got his tail up, poised?
He is grumpy.

489
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:59,730
He gets his stinger back over the top
Of his head, ready to grab and sting.

490
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:03,152
Trying to recuperate.

491
00:54:09,542 --> 00:54:10,871
Sofia.

492
00:54:18,676 --> 00:54:21,345
Sofia, why are you here?

493
00:54:24,932 --> 00:54:27,767
I broke it. Mr Conrad will fix it.

494
00:54:35,025 --> 00:54:36,733
What?

495
00:54:37,902 --> 00:54:41,237
Turkey? No. No tacchino.

496
00:54:43,241 --> 00:54:46,077
No telephone. Just give it to me.

497
00:54:53,501 --> 00:54:54,912
Hello.

498
00:54:56,588 --> 00:54:58,663
Get rid of her.

499
00:54:59,506 --> 00:55:03,551
Sofia, no tacchino.

500
00:55:15,272 --> 00:55:18,273
- Anymore visitors?
- No.

501
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:35,079
Come on. Yeah, baby, take it off.

502
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:42,913
All right. Suit yourself.

503
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:13,076
I have to go. You have to call me back.

504
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,236
Have you seen this?

505
00:56:15,329 --> 00:56:18,994
What's this?
''Girl found wandering on Hart lsland''?

506
00:56:19,083 --> 00:56:22,286
- Where'd you find this?
- In her file in your office.

507
00:56:22,377 --> 00:56:25,829
''A young girl was found
among the coffins on Hart Island.''

508
00:56:25,923 --> 00:56:29,837
This is around the time her father died.
I should run this by Child Services.

509
00:56:29,926 --> 00:56:33,047
Could she have been lost or unattended?
That's bizarre.

510
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:36,008
On an island in the East River?

511
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:43,020
I saw Sarah. Two days ago. She was
meeting her boyfriend in the Village.

512
00:56:43,106 --> 00:56:47,318
- Maybe she's still with him.
- She could be. Just wait one second.

513
00:56:48,778 --> 00:56:51,898
Jake. Tray 57, and just her face.

514
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:58,283
- It stinks in here.
- I know. Just breathe through your mouth.

515
00:56:58,371 --> 00:57:02,700
- I've never seen anyone dead before.
- You'll do fine.

516
00:57:02,792 --> 00:57:07,038
- I'm gonna get sick.
- No one in here's gonna mind.

517
00:57:07,129 --> 00:57:09,204
Come on.

518
00:57:16,888 --> 00:57:20,423
I've gotta take this.
But I'm gonna be right here.

519
00:57:22,894 --> 00:57:26,179
Cassidy. Hey, baby.

520
00:57:26,272 --> 00:57:33,402
Yeah. You should take the one o'clock,
because I'll be at Penn Station by two.

521
00:57:33,487 --> 00:57:36,109
- Make it seven.
- I promise.

522
00:57:36,198 --> 00:57:38,606
Don't promise.

523
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:42,495
What? Yeah, I'm almost done here.

524
00:57:42,747 --> 00:57:46,080
Yeah. I'm at the city morgue. Bye.

525
00:57:48,419 --> 00:57:51,918
- Your NCIC on the guy with the busted neck.
- I got a hit.

526
00:57:54,007 --> 00:57:55,667
Leon Edwards Croft.

527
00:57:58,136 --> 00:58:03,047
- Jesus, what does he have, 15, 20 arrests?
- A busy little bad guy that won't be missed.

528
00:58:03,141 --> 00:58:08,265
- You run him for known associates?
- Of course. Am I not a paid professional?

529
00:58:16,987 --> 00:58:19,063
It's OK.

530
00:58:19,824 --> 00:58:22,315
Why would someone do this to Sarah?

531
00:58:23,369 --> 00:58:27,829
The guy with the cigarette burns, Croft?
He was the driver for this crew.

532
00:58:27,915 --> 00:58:31,615
Robbery said they hit banks.
Here, Jersey, Delaware, Virginia.

533
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:34,248
No convictions till '91.

534
00:58:34,338 --> 00:58:38,287
And three of his friends just
capped off a ten-year jolt in Attica.

535
00:58:40,427 --> 00:58:44,590
Patrick Barry Koster.
He's the last one that got out. November 4th.

536
00:58:44,681 --> 00:58:46,803
November 4th.

537
00:58:46,891 --> 00:58:49,216
Did Croft rat these guys out?

538
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:52,097
I don't know. Could be payback.

539
00:58:52,188 --> 00:58:56,267
He has no priors. There is nothing on him.
He just came out of nowhere.

540
00:58:56,358 --> 00:59:01,353
I know. It's the only thing
he ever got popped for. The guy's a ghost.

541
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:05,658
I guess that's who I need to talk to.
Thank you.

542
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:07,486
- Watch your back.
- Yeah.

543
00:59:15,043 --> 00:59:18,708
You picked Jessie's
absolutely favourite thing.

544
00:59:18,797 --> 00:59:22,841
She and Sally were
inseparable since they were two.

545
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:27,549
Where is she?

546
00:59:28,348 --> 00:59:31,182
Where's Jessie?

547
00:59:33,352 --> 00:59:35,759
They took her.

548
00:59:35,854 --> 00:59:41,394
Now she's really scared. As scared as you
were when you went for that guy at Rockland,

549
00:59:41,485 --> 00:59:44,438
but she's only eight years old, Elisabeth.

550
00:59:44,529 --> 00:59:49,107
She's not as strong as you are. She can't
protect herself as well as you can.

551
00:59:49,826 --> 00:59:53,527
I am not just here to help you.

552
00:59:54,914 --> 00:59:59,660
- Me help you.
- I need you to help me.

553
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:07,375
Otherwise, I'm not getting my little girl back.

554
01:00:11,805 --> 01:00:14,474
Today's Thanksgiving.

555
01:00:15,226 --> 01:00:17,302
Do you remember Thanksgiving?

556
01:00:18,353 --> 01:00:21,389
Yes, I remember.

557
01:00:22,899 --> 01:00:25,390
Who were you with?

558
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:29,737
My dad.

559
01:00:29,822 --> 01:00:31,899
Just me and my dad.

560
01:00:33,701 --> 01:00:36,489
Being strong isn't only
About protecting yourself.

561
01:00:36,579 --> 01:00:38,619
It's also having the strength to let go,

562
01:00:38,706 --> 01:00:41,872
especially if you're holding
onto something so tightly

563
01:00:41,959 --> 01:00:45,659
that you don't even know
that you could have a better life.

564
01:00:47,798 --> 01:00:53,918
The only way that you can
help yourself is if you go back.

565
01:01:00,686 --> 01:01:04,552
You have to go back
to that day on the subway.

566
01:01:05,232 --> 01:01:08,398
I can't. Can't do it. No.

567
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,567
Here we go. The main event.

568
01:01:11,655 --> 01:01:14,359
You can't help my little girl
unless you go back.

569
01:01:14,448 --> 01:01:16,904
No, please.

570
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:23,117
Listen to me. The men that have Jessie

571
01:01:25,125 --> 01:01:29,337
are the same men you're frightened of,
the men that sent the orderly after you.

572
01:01:29,422 --> 01:01:32,837
- I don't wanna hear this.
- All they want is a number.

573
01:01:32,925 --> 01:01:35,630
- You want what they want.
- They know you know it.

574
01:01:35,719 --> 01:01:39,302
- They'll kill my little girl if you don't tell me.
- Stop it.

575
01:01:39,389 --> 01:01:40,089
Daddy.

576
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,010
- Is it a telephone number?
- No.

577
01:01:43,101 --> 01:01:45,972
- An address? An account?
- I don't know.

578
01:01:46,062 --> 01:01:48,933
- A bank account? A code? A place?
- No.

579
01:01:49,023 --> 01:01:51,016
What is it?

580
01:01:53,695 --> 01:01:56,267
What's wrong? We lost the feed?

581
01:01:56,530 --> 01:01:58,902
No, we're good.

582
01:01:59,158 --> 01:02:02,242
You leave him alone.

583
01:02:04,663 --> 01:02:06,787
Your father is gone.

584
01:02:08,751 --> 01:02:12,000
And no one is gonna hurt him any more.

585
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:17,255
My little girl is still alive.

586
01:02:18,176 --> 01:02:20,798
Jessie is alive.

587
01:02:31,731 --> 01:02:33,807
Dr Conrad...

588
01:02:36,193 --> 01:02:38,269
I'm scared.

589
01:02:51,792 --> 01:02:54,164
I know. I'm sorry.

590
01:02:55,295 --> 01:02:57,372
- Shit.
- It's OK.

591
01:03:00,759 --> 01:03:02,716
- Elisabeth...
- I'll try.

592
01:03:04,179 --> 01:03:05,721
You're OK.

593
01:03:18,317 --> 01:03:20,938
Long time since breakfast.

594
01:03:21,653 --> 01:03:25,402
- Yeah.
- I wish we had some cheeseburgers.

595
01:03:37,961 --> 01:03:40,499
The best turkey you ever had.

596
01:03:40,589 --> 01:03:43,874
Careful, or I'll put you in the oven with it.

597
01:03:46,928 --> 01:03:49,335
I love you, Daddy.

598
01:04:12,536 --> 01:04:16,829
- What's that?
- This is a 5cc syringe,

599
01:04:16,915 --> 01:04:19,619
with a 10-gauge needle
and 500mg of sodium amytal.

600
01:04:19,709 --> 01:04:25,462
500mg? Why not give her a quart of Jack
Daniel's and stick a shotgun in her mouth?

601
01:04:25,548 --> 01:04:29,248
The event is obviously
right beneath the surface.

602
01:04:29,343 --> 01:04:33,211
She should respond beautifully to Amytal.

603
01:04:43,398 --> 01:04:45,059
Answer it.

604
01:04:54,033 --> 01:04:56,110
You answer the phone.

605
01:05:02,292 --> 01:05:04,782
Tell them everything's OK,

606
01:05:04,877 --> 01:05:07,166
and that you're going to plan B.

607
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:14,336
Everything's OK, and we're going to plan B.

608
01:05:14,678 --> 01:05:17,549
It's a drug.

609
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:22,465
You knew all about the numbers,
and you set me up, Louis.

610
01:05:22,561 --> 01:05:25,764
- I swear to God...
- You tell me why or l'm gonna shove this...

611
01:05:25,856 --> 01:05:28,975
They got my fucking girlfriend.
He's keeping Sarah hostage.

612
01:05:29,067 --> 01:05:33,112
- He'll kill her if I don't get him this number.
- Your girlfriend, Louis?

613
01:05:33,196 --> 01:05:35,354
He's got my daughter.

614
01:05:37,575 --> 01:05:41,787
- He's got my little girl.
- Nathan, I didn't know that.

615
01:05:41,872 --> 01:05:44,575
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

616
01:05:45,208 --> 01:05:48,790
You gotta get the number for this guy.
He'll go away. It's that simple.

617
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:50,870
Dr Sachs?

618
01:05:52,756 --> 01:05:55,082
- Yes?
- There's a cop here to see you.

619
01:05:56,844 --> 01:06:00,628
- A cop? What kind of cop?
- I don't know.

620
01:06:01,348 --> 01:06:05,393
- What does he want?
- She. She didn't say. She's in your office.

621
01:06:05,477 --> 01:06:07,802
OK.

622
01:06:09,106 --> 01:06:11,347
- Tell her I'll be right there.
- OK.

623
01:06:14,402 --> 01:06:19,741
- He said no cops under any circumstances.
- You have got to go down to your office.

624
01:06:19,824 --> 01:06:23,692
You have to be cool,
and you make her go away.

625
01:06:41,678 --> 01:06:44,798
If we don't have it by 4.30, we go to plan...

626
01:07:27,472 --> 01:07:30,141
Peanut butter and jelly.
What kind of jelly is it?

627
01:07:35,271 --> 01:07:37,098
Hello there.

628
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:41,436
- I'm Louis Sachs.
- Hi. Detective Cassidy.

629
01:07:46,031 --> 01:07:48,653
- Pretty girl. Is that your daughter?
- This?

630
01:07:48,742 --> 01:07:52,989
No. This is not my daughter.
How can I help you today, Detective?

631
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,997
- I'm here about this woman.
- What about her?

632
01:07:56,083 --> 01:07:59,617
- You don't know her?
- Nope.

633
01:08:12,682 --> 01:08:15,967
She worked in the hospital for five months.
She was a resident.

634
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:19,927
Really? We have dozens and dozens
of residents, I will tell you that.

635
01:08:20,022 --> 01:08:23,391
She worked in the department you oversee.

636
01:08:24,485 --> 01:08:27,687
That's strange. I should know who she is.

637
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:31,278
And I don't. So there's gotta be a mistake.

638
01:08:31,366 --> 01:08:34,071
- When did you last see Sarah?
- Detective.

639
01:08:35,537 --> 01:08:40,246
I just told you, and I'll tell you again,
I do not know who that is.

640
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:52,177
Where are we going?

641
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:55,879
- Do you have a lawyer, sir?
- What?

642
01:08:55,973 --> 01:08:59,009
- Do you have a lawyer?
- What are you talking about?

643
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:02,552
- You don't know Sarah?
- No. Why are we talking about lawyers?

644
01:09:02,646 --> 01:09:07,190
A week ago, in Central Park, with you.
She told her roommate Vanessa about it.

645
01:09:07,275 --> 01:09:10,727
- You know Vanessa? She knows you.
- I don't know Vanessa either.

646
01:09:10,821 --> 01:09:12,944
I'm about to read you your rights.

647
01:09:13,032 --> 01:09:15,238
- My rights?
- Yeah, but first...

648
01:09:15,325 --> 01:09:18,694
- What did I do?
- I want you to do me a favour.

649
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:24,125
This is last weekend, with you,
by the fountain in Central Park.

650
01:09:24,208 --> 01:09:28,040
You took this picture. And this is her now.

651
01:09:28,129 --> 01:09:32,127
This one you did, this one I took.
Who do you think did better, me or you?

652
01:09:32,217 --> 01:09:35,217
- That's not Sarah.
- That's Sarah, laid out in the morgue.

653
01:09:35,302 --> 01:09:40,759
- No, it's not Sarah in the fucking morgue.
- I work Homicide, Dr Sachs. That's Sarah.

654
01:09:41,726 --> 01:09:42,888
The morgue?

655
01:09:50,692 --> 01:09:54,357
- It can't be Sarah. That's not the deal.
- That's not the deal?

656
01:09:56,114 --> 01:09:59,068
Why don't you tell me
what the fuck the deal is?

657
01:09:59,158 --> 01:10:03,287
Who is part of the deal?
Is he part of it? How about him?

658
01:10:04,414 --> 01:10:07,450
Tell me who is part of the deal.

659
01:10:07,541 --> 01:10:11,076
He said we had until five today.
That's a mistake.

660
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:13,163
It's no mistake. Who's ''we''?

661
01:10:13,256 --> 01:10:15,828
We are so fuckin' close.
All we need is a half hour.

662
01:10:15,924 --> 01:10:18,961
- Dr Sachs, who is ''we''?
- That's not Sarah.

663
01:10:19,053 --> 01:10:23,929
Why don't you quit wasting
my fucking time and tell me, who's ''we''?

664
01:10:25,517 --> 01:10:28,008
You like country music?

665
01:11:11,269 --> 01:11:14,021
What did I say about noise?

666
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,437
Daddy's smart little girl, aren't you?

667
01:11:20,945 --> 01:11:23,982
Better hope your mother didn't hear that.

668
01:11:24,074 --> 01:11:26,149
Go full screen on her.

669
01:11:30,913 --> 01:11:33,285
Tighter.

670
01:11:52,893 --> 01:11:56,511
- She heard.
- How do you know?

671
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:00,105
She's stopped breathing.

672
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,876
So what can I do for you, Doc?

673
01:12:30,553 --> 01:12:32,878
Arnie, I need to ask you a favour.

674
01:12:34,307 --> 01:12:37,261
Were you takin' Burrows for a stroll?

675
01:12:40,146 --> 01:12:44,274
- We're out of here. Bring her.
- Mommy, Daddy, I'm up here!

676
01:12:58,747 --> 01:13:00,407
Take care of her.

677
01:13:01,666 --> 01:13:03,908
I need you to open the gates.

678
01:13:04,002 --> 01:13:07,205
- On whose authorisation?
- This is between you and me.

679
01:13:09,341 --> 01:13:12,840
That's why they call this place
the nuthouse, Doc.

680
01:13:13,136 --> 01:13:17,004
Cos I'd have to be, basically,
fuckin' nuts to let you do that.

681
01:13:18,432 --> 01:13:22,382
OK. Well, I just had to ask you...

682
01:13:26,315 --> 01:13:31,310
It's OK, Arnie. It's just a sedative.

683
01:13:31,404 --> 01:13:34,986
It's all right. You'll be fine in about an hour.

684
01:14:18,865 --> 01:14:20,941
Dr Conrad?

685
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:26,244
Fuck.

686
01:14:50,145 --> 01:14:52,221
Excuse me.

687
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:06,074
Security breach. Start emergency procedures.

688
01:15:06,161 --> 01:15:12,661
Security personnel, officer down. We have a
Security breach. Start emergency procedures.

689
01:16:05,258 --> 01:16:09,387
A gold Land Rover just left Bridgeview,
heading east.

690
01:16:09,471 --> 01:16:12,093
- They're leaving.
- The driver is a Dr Conrad.

691
01:16:12,182 --> 01:16:15,931
Wanted for questioning
in connection with a homicide.

692
01:16:19,939 --> 01:16:23,189
Have an RMP respond
to his residence immediately.

693
01:17:18,079 --> 01:17:20,948
Oh, my God.

694
01:17:39,098 --> 01:17:41,768
- What's on your mind, Nathan?
- Field trip.

695
01:17:48,191 --> 01:17:51,809
Wait a second. Where are you taking Jessie?

696
01:17:52,110 --> 01:17:54,399
- Why are you moving her?
- You have 44 minutes.

697
01:17:58,868 --> 01:18:00,243
Why are you moving her?

698
01:18:04,665 --> 01:18:08,164
All right, I will get you the number.

699
01:18:08,876 --> 01:18:11,581
- Just don't hurt her.
- 43 minutes.

700
01:18:25,101 --> 01:18:29,146
You have reached New York City's
Emergency services. Please stay on the line.

701
01:18:29,229 --> 01:18:33,939
Your call will be answered in
the order in which it was received.

702
01:18:37,029 --> 01:18:39,105
You crippled bitch.

703
01:19:41,298 --> 01:19:43,375
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

704
01:20:00,359 --> 01:20:01,390
Move.

705
01:20:07,407 --> 01:20:11,618
- This is where it happened, isn't it?
- No.

706
01:20:14,955 --> 01:20:17,577
When we left home, my dad and me...

707
01:20:23,338 --> 01:20:25,166
Big car, dark.

708
01:20:28,218 --> 01:20:30,674
I'd never seen my dad so scared.

709
01:20:30,971 --> 01:20:34,671
He grabbed my arm. He kept running.

710
01:20:34,766 --> 01:20:36,842
And I tried to keep up.

711
01:20:46,653 --> 01:20:48,775
- You can do it.
- OK.

712
01:20:49,739 --> 01:20:52,112
You can do it. Let's go.

713
01:20:57,329 --> 01:20:58,788
It's OK.

714
01:21:03,502 --> 01:21:04,533
Elisabeth?

715
01:21:06,546 --> 01:21:08,623
There were lots of people.

716
01:21:09,633 --> 01:21:12,207
But my dad just pulled me through them.

717
01:21:14,429 --> 01:21:16,837
I looked back.

718
01:21:17,308 --> 01:21:19,715
They were so fast.

719
01:21:20,977 --> 01:21:23,303
They're still behind us.

720
01:21:25,106 --> 01:21:27,811
There were only two men. We lost one.

721
01:21:30,362 --> 01:21:32,437
My dad took me around the corner.

722
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:48,577
He made me hide over here.

723
01:21:51,131 --> 01:21:55,958
Listen to me carefully.
You and Mishka, you gotta wait here.

724
01:21:56,052 --> 01:21:59,007
It's gonna be fine.

725
01:22:04,853 --> 01:22:07,260
Russel, where've you been?

726
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:12,274
What's in the fuckin'bag?

727
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:15,645
They could see my dad's face
and he tried to talk to them.

728
01:22:19,783 --> 01:22:22,274
There's nothing in the fuckin'bag.

729
01:22:23,411 --> 01:22:25,902
Where is it, Russel?

730
01:22:28,834 --> 01:22:33,294
What's happening now? Elisabeth?

731
01:22:33,922 --> 01:22:35,998
I don't believe a fuckin' word.

732
01:22:39,928 --> 01:22:42,300
Elisabeth, what do you see?

733
01:22:42,389 --> 01:22:44,132
Where is it?

734
01:22:44,223 --> 01:22:48,138
The one in the red coat kept on kicking him

735
01:22:48,228 --> 01:22:51,928
and asking him
''Where is it? Tell me where it is.''

736
01:22:52,314 --> 01:22:55,565
- Let me up and I'll tell you where it is.
- Elisabeth.

737
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,893
- Where is it?
- Come on, help me up.

738
01:23:00,989 --> 01:23:06,494
And everybody was watching
and no one would help.

739
01:23:20,675 --> 01:23:23,131
Elisabeth, what did the man want?

740
01:23:25,971 --> 01:23:28,260
- I can almost reach him.
- Elisabeth.

741
01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:32,139
- Daddy!
- No!

742
01:23:37,358 --> 01:23:39,896
Turn around. Hands up.

743
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:47,988
- Down on your knees.
- What did the man want, Elisabeth?

744
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:51,695
Did he want a number?

745
01:23:53,832 --> 01:23:56,833
Elisabeth,
I need to know what the man wanted.

746
01:23:57,627 --> 01:24:00,332
He wants Mishka. My doll.

747
01:24:00,630 --> 01:24:04,710
- And where is Mishka? Where is your doll?
- Hang onto that, baby.

748
01:24:41,085 --> 01:24:43,576
- Yeah.
- You're cutting it rather close.

749
01:24:43,671 --> 01:24:45,913
All right. I have what you want.

750
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:48,667
Good. I'm listening.

751
01:24:49,051 --> 01:24:53,179
I've decided I'm gonna deliver
the number to you in person.

752
01:24:53,264 --> 01:24:55,671
No time.

753
01:24:55,766 --> 01:24:58,339
- No choice.
- Being brave again, Nathan.

754
01:24:58,685 --> 01:25:01,640
That's the best way
to get your daughter killed.

755
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:06,059
Other than missing the deadline,
which is less than three minutes away.

756
01:25:06,151 --> 01:25:08,393
Rule number one. No more clock.

757
01:25:08,862 --> 01:25:10,819
- What?
- You heard me.

758
01:25:11,823 --> 01:25:14,824
- Now, I'll meet you there.
- Where?

759
01:25:15,326 --> 01:25:20,533
I think you know where. And rule number
two, I want to speak to my daughter now.

760
01:25:21,457 --> 01:25:24,908
Do you hear me?
I want to speak to my daughter now.

761
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:30,746
- Daddy?
- Pumpkin, are you all right?

762
01:25:31,091 --> 01:25:33,380
Yeah. Daddy, please come get me now.

763
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:36,468
I'm on my way, sweetheart.

764
01:25:38,891 --> 01:25:43,102
- Anything else?
- Rule number three. No more phone.

765
01:25:51,527 --> 01:25:55,739
I got a medical emergency.
I'll get this phone back to you.

766
01:26:30,148 --> 01:26:33,066
- Aggie?
- Is she alive?

767
01:26:33,484 --> 01:26:35,809
- She's fine.
- Where is she?

768
01:26:36,446 --> 01:26:38,521
Aggie, listen to me.

769
01:26:40,033 --> 01:26:42,606
What is that? Did you call the police?

770
01:26:43,035 --> 01:26:45,241
Aggie?

771
01:26:45,329 --> 01:26:48,615
No. But somebody did.

772
01:26:49,166 --> 01:26:51,491
Do they know what's going on?

773
01:26:51,585 --> 01:26:55,879
- Not yet. Listen.
- I'm here.

774
01:26:56,298 --> 01:26:58,373
Just get her back.

775
01:28:32,765 --> 01:28:34,888
What you doin' down there?

776
01:28:34,975 --> 01:28:38,807
That's my boat. Where you goin', asshole?

777
01:28:40,439 --> 01:28:43,012
What you doin'? Bring that back.

778
01:30:37,384 --> 01:30:39,460
Dr Conrad.

779
01:30:41,472 --> 01:30:43,547
You're a committed man.

780
01:30:47,227 --> 01:30:49,516
I wanna see her.

781
01:30:51,064 --> 01:30:53,389
I wanna see her now.

782
01:30:54,693 --> 01:30:57,018
Grim place for a holiday, isn't it?

783
01:31:02,366 --> 01:31:04,608
Hello, Elisabeth.

784
01:31:06,370 --> 01:31:09,620
I've thought about you
every day for the last ten years.

785
01:31:09,707 --> 01:31:12,328
I bet you've thought about me, too.

786
01:31:14,336 --> 01:31:17,870
I know you've been through a lot.
But so have I.

787
01:31:20,843 --> 01:31:23,759
Your father let us both down.

788
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:30,261
- Where's my daughter?
- She hasn't given it to you.

789
01:31:30,352 --> 01:31:32,474
- Where is she?
- She won't give it to you.

790
01:31:32,562 --> 01:31:34,803
- I wanna see Jessie.
- Where's my number?

791
01:31:34,897 --> 01:31:37,435
You're not getting anything until I see...

792
01:31:40,153 --> 01:31:42,691
We talked about bravery today.

793
01:31:47,535 --> 01:31:50,571
It's not good.

794
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:55,616
You need to know how to use these.

795
01:32:02,632 --> 01:32:04,708
I wanna see my daughter.

796
01:32:06,344 --> 01:32:08,586
Yeah, I think you've earned it.

797
01:32:09,097 --> 01:32:11,422
- Max.
- Daddy?

798
01:32:12,225 --> 01:32:14,798
- Jessie?
- Daddy.

799
01:32:15,978 --> 01:32:19,513
It's all right, honey. You're gonna be fine.

800
01:32:21,359 --> 01:32:24,525
You guessed the number
is a grave. Very good.

801
01:32:24,612 --> 01:32:26,688
Now what?

802
01:32:27,531 --> 01:32:30,402
I finish my job.

803
01:32:37,249 --> 01:32:40,036
Come on, Nathan. Up the stairs.

804
01:32:56,893 --> 01:32:58,849
Over there, by the table.

805
01:32:59,812 --> 01:33:02,682
And Elisabeth. Not her.

806
01:33:03,024 --> 01:33:05,230
Take her back outside.

807
01:33:05,943 --> 01:33:10,735
- Daddy?
- Jessie, you're gonna be all right, honey.

808
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:15,904
Now, let's see what 200 an hour can do.

809
01:33:33,469 --> 01:33:37,087
Officer Peterson. Nice work.
You found my car. Where is it?

810
01:33:37,348 --> 01:33:40,716
- It's over there.
- OK. Now, where's my guy?

811
01:33:40,809 --> 01:33:44,344
He smashed through a steel fence
on the Corrections pier.

812
01:33:44,438 --> 01:33:47,558
Then he jacked a boat from that individual.

813
01:33:47,650 --> 01:33:50,935
He and some girl. Sounds a little hinky.

814
01:33:51,028 --> 01:33:54,527
- A boat to where?
- That's the coastguard's problem.

815
01:33:54,615 --> 01:33:59,856
It is not the coastguard's problem. It is my problem.
It is your problem. What is over there?

816
01:34:08,211 --> 01:34:12,956
- Where's the music coming from, Elisabeth?
- The radio.

817
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:18,260
- Where?
- It's playing on the boat.

818
01:34:22,099 --> 01:34:25,052
On the boat that brought
you here the first time?

819
01:34:25,143 --> 01:34:27,220
Yeah.

820
01:34:28,813 --> 01:34:31,021
It was cold. It was wet.

821
01:34:32,859 --> 01:34:36,442
My eyes were burning,
but I was with my dad.

822
01:34:37,697 --> 01:34:40,733
How did you know which one was your dad?

823
01:34:41,743 --> 01:34:44,151
They gave him a number.

824
01:34:45,997 --> 01:34:48,666
Where was this number?

825
01:34:52,044 --> 01:34:57,750
It's on his box.
They carved the number on top of his box.

826
01:35:01,428 --> 01:35:04,548
I tried to get it open,
but my fingers were numb.

827
01:35:05,558 --> 01:35:08,677
I couldn't lift it, it was too heavy.

828
01:35:09,561 --> 01:35:12,847
I couldn't put Mishka inside.

829
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:16,308
Better pray she's lying, Nathan.

830
01:35:16,401 --> 01:35:20,102
Where did Mishka go?
What happened to Mishka?

831
01:35:20,446 --> 01:35:24,776
- They saw me.
- Who saw you?

832
01:35:25,035 --> 01:35:28,569
The men with the music.

833
01:35:29,121 --> 01:35:33,866
They were working. They said my lips
were blue. They gave me a blanket.

834
01:35:36,629 --> 01:35:39,167
I told them ''My dad's inside.''

835
01:35:40,299 --> 01:35:42,790
''And I need to put her inside with him.''

836
01:35:44,469 --> 01:35:48,763
''I need to put Mishka in the box,'' I told them.

837
01:35:53,936 --> 01:35:56,060
What did they do?

838
01:36:01,653 --> 01:36:03,859
They helped me.

839
01:36:10,869 --> 01:36:16,576
They helped me put Mishka
inside the box with him.

840
01:36:18,085 --> 01:36:20,872
They let me stay with him.

841
01:36:22,297 --> 01:36:23,840
Until...

842
01:37:10,510 --> 01:37:13,214
So what's gonna happen
if you dig this thing up?

843
01:37:13,304 --> 01:37:16,839
He's gonna have you
kill me and my little girl.

844
01:37:17,183 --> 01:37:19,259
You like her. I can tell that.

845
01:37:20,686 --> 01:37:24,269
And when you're done with us,
he'll be done with you.

846
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:27,525
Just keep walkin'.

847
01:38:18,366 --> 01:38:22,281
This boat's for charter, not runnin'
around the Sound on Thanksgiving.

848
01:38:22,371 --> 01:38:28,539
Like I said, sir, it's police business. Do me a
favour, Captain Bligh. Drive the friggin' boat.

849
01:38:48,729 --> 01:38:50,971
Go on, Max. Open it up.

850
01:39:17,131 --> 01:39:19,208
Get her out.

851
01:39:19,717 --> 01:39:21,295
The girl. Out.

852
01:39:23,429 --> 01:39:25,754
- Sit down.
- Daddy.

853
01:39:27,183 --> 01:39:29,341
Let me go.

854
01:39:30,435 --> 01:39:34,896
I am going to put a bullet through your knee.
Then you'll give me the right number.

855
01:39:34,981 --> 01:39:36,891
No.

856
01:39:45,033 --> 01:39:47,440
No. Get off.

857
01:39:50,372 --> 01:39:51,617
Get her off.

858
01:39:53,082 --> 01:39:54,790
Sit down.

859
01:39:54,876 --> 01:39:58,624
Forget the fuckin' number.
Just say hi to your dad from me.

860
01:39:58,713 --> 01:40:01,832
- She gave it to you - in reverse.
- She gave me nothing.

861
01:40:01,924 --> 01:40:05,673
- It's reversed in her mind.
- Shut up. I've got nothing, you lying bitch.

862
01:40:05,761 --> 01:40:08,086
Cognitive distortion.

863
01:40:08,472 --> 01:40:11,259
She wrote it right to left.

864
01:40:11,809 --> 01:40:14,097
Look.

865
01:40:16,313 --> 01:40:18,851
She sees it in a mirror.

866
01:40:29,909 --> 01:40:33,243
Can you imagine
what'll happen if this is bullshit?

867
01:40:44,506 --> 01:40:47,710
Central, this is
Detective Cassidy from Homicide.

868
01:40:47,801 --> 01:40:50,968
Shots fired
on the northeast shore of Hart island.

869
01:40:51,054 --> 01:40:53,510
I'm en route. I need Harbor and Aviation.

870
01:41:50,445 --> 01:41:52,271
Ten years of my life.

871
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,438
Bought and fuckin' paid for.

872
01:42:04,917 --> 01:42:07,372
Take care of that.

873
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:54,137
You're not like me, Nathan.

874
01:43:54,479 --> 01:43:57,930
I would have killed
a man who took my little girl.

875
01:43:59,109 --> 01:44:01,564
Police. Don't move.

876
01:44:04,907 --> 01:44:07,444
Drop your weapon.

877
01:44:10,578 --> 01:44:12,867
Go on.

878
01:44:43,944 --> 01:44:45,735
I never got your name.

879
01:44:48,406 --> 01:44:50,778
Patrick.

880
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:58,331
Are you sure I'm not like you?

881
01:45:02,002 --> 01:45:04,410
Are you sure?

882
01:45:14,723 --> 01:45:17,890
Was this really worth it?

883
01:45:18,643 --> 01:45:20,268
What?

884
01:45:21,855 --> 01:45:24,428
Your life.

885
01:45:24,524 --> 01:45:27,015
Absolutely.

886
01:45:28,528 --> 01:45:30,604
It's mine.

887
01:45:33,449 --> 01:45:35,074
Then you go get it.

888
01:47:55,502 --> 01:47:58,075
I'll be right back, sweetie.

889
01:48:03,384 --> 01:48:06,136
- How are you holdin' up?
- I've been better.

890
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:11,716
Thank you.

891
01:48:44,215 --> 01:48:46,587
Let's go. Come on.
