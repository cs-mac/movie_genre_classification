1
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:56,599
It was all that damn kid.

2
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,064
I've always thought he
had no empathy at all...

3
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:06,609
but I never imagined this.

4
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:09,445
I can't believe it.

5
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:13,032
There must be some mistake.

6
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,083
There's no proof, is there?

7
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,961
I saw him.

8
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,549
He snuck out of the house that night.

9
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:33,260
But maybe he just went out.

10
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,970
Not just that night.

11
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:38,224
When Mr Kumagai died, too.

12
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:45,815
We can't just let this go.

13
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:55,783
It's just that he doesn't
understand the difference...

14
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,245
between right and wrong.

15
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:04,500
We can't have raised him right.

16
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:07,128
Don't punish him.

17
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,588
This has gone way beyond that.

18
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,925
He needs to be put away.

19
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,011
That would be cruel!

20
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:19,723
The boy's only 14!

21
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:50,004
LESSON OF THE EVIL

22
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,978
The rumors are true.

23
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:10,024
The marks in Year 1 Class 3
were very similar, and...

24
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:13,027
Yes, we know that.

25
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:19,283
So this term, how do
we stop this group cheating...

26
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,660
ls "cunning" the English word?

27
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:25,414
No, it's "cheating".

28
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,082
Oh...

29
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,792
And so?

30
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,086
Probably...

31
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:35,758
they're using cell phones.

32
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,011
So it's email?

33
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,722
They text without looking,

34
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,767
so from under a desk would be easy.

35
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:47,394
So I guess we ban cell phones.

36
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,938
We do that...

37
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:52,441
but we can't do body
searches and desk checks.

38
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:57,321
And it's not good policy to
openly distrust our students.

39
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,490
So what do we do?

40
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:03,661
Perhaps our Radio Club staff advisor...

41
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,663
could help us here.

42
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,040
Mr Tsurii?

43
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,418
This way we can shut down...

44
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,546
all the cell-phone cheating.

45
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,007
Excellent!

46
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,842
However...

47
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,198
However what, Mr Hasumi?

48
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:47,288
We may be in violation of the Radio Law.

49
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:52,501
You mean we'll be jamming phones?

50
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:56,463
We can adjust to stop it
going beyond the school grounds.

51
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,133
And limit it to exam times.

52
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,719
No one's likely to find out.

53
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:02,803
Yeah, but

54
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:06,724
breaking the law to stop cheating?

55
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,726
That's all mixed up.

56
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:16,025
Let's think of another way, then.

57
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:27,119
That's it for this morning's meeting.

58
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,204
Mr Hasumi?

59
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:32,708
Go for it.

60
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,336
I will.

61
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,964
I have high hopes.

62
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,383
Right.

63
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,554
Hasumin!

64
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:46,722
'Morning.

65
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,891
Good morning, Misaki & Ayane

66
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,351
Don't forget me!

67
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,061
Hey! Nice hair, Mayu

68
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,231
Questions so far?

69
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:57,691
Yes.

70
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:58,817
Yes, Toru

71
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:02,112
You always say "good" and "great".

72
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,489
What's the difference?

73
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,533
Good question.

74
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,495
Correct is "good", better is "great".

75
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,955
Even better is "excellent".

76
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,249
And there's more.

77
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:21,382
If it strikes you deep in your soul...

78
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:22,925
Mr. Watarai! It's your turn!

79
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:28,305
Magnificent

80
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:29,848
Is that right?

81
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,600
Excellent!

82
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:36,522
I'm trying to get into Todai University.

83
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:38,524
Magnificent

84
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:40,818
Let's repeat.

85
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:44,655
Magnificent

86
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,534
What does it mean?

87
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,660
Mr. Nagoshi! You'll up!

88
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:51,662
Sir?

89
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:53,914
Stand up, Please

90
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:08,095
All right, translate the title of
that comic book into English.

91
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,266
You can do it!

92
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,564
I'm sorry!

93
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,318
OK, it comes from "magnify".

94
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,071
It's an adjective.

95
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:32,077
On tests, remember
it means "beautiful", or "impressive".

96
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:34,121
Everyone! You've got a picture?

97
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:35,622
Yes.

98
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,458
OK. Next.

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,172
Grand, "majestic".

100
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:46,300
Related to "magnificent".

101
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,635
Magnificent?

102
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:52,306
A type of hymn, usually sung at evening.

103
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:56,977
Magnificent praises something
beyond normal understanding.

104
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:01,315
Keisuke! You're wasted
on science, you know.

105
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:02,941
Aw, shutout.

106
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:08,530
So how's your class going?
Are you used to Hasumi yet?

107
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,909
He's OK.

108
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,411
Anyway, word's getting around.

109
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,038
About what?

110
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,791
The cheating. You're doing it again, right?

111
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,589
You like raising shit.

112
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,675
What good does it do you?

113
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,762
Yeah. Why do you do it?

114
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,305
No reason.

115
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,307
Just to pass time.

116
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:39,102
It's a game to mess up
their marking scheme.

117
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,231
I won't get caught.

118
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:51,907
Yeah, you should be all right.

119
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:53,200
Sure!

120
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:56,078
After exams I'm taking off.

121
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,081
Where this time?

122
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:02,626
I don't know. Wherever I feel like then.

123
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:07,297
I haven't missed a school day
since 2nd year started.

124
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,906
You always say that!

125
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:37,995
There's no bullying here.
We're right on top of it.

126
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:43,917
Well, we've talked to her classmates again.

127
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,129
There's no evidence of bullying.

128
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,256
So Rina's lying?

129
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,466
I'm not saying that.

130
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:55,679
Maybe there's been some misunderstanding...

131
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,890
Misunderstanding?

132
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:04,187
You mean she just thinks
she's being bullied when she isn't?!

133
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:09,943
Do you think the ones doing it
don't know what'll happen...

134
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,820
if they own up to it?!

135
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,363
Calm down, please.

136
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:15,657
Calm down?!

137
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,702
Did you just tell me to calm down?!

138
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:24,291
Everything I do is for my daughter.

139
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,168
I'll kick your ass!

140
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:27,586
Try me!

141
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,714
I can fight, you know!

142
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:37,804
Inside.

143
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,157
Did you see that?

144
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,825
That was Miya, right?

145
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:46,039
Psychopathology Research

146
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,809
Hasumin! 'Morning!

147
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,102
Careful!

148
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,401
Who put gum in here!

149
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:44,449
Just leave it.

150
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:49,162
Then we can't lock it from inside.
Someone'll break in.

151
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,833
They'll just wreck it again.
Think of another way.

152
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,043
Hasumin...

153
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,005
What's up?

154
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,054
Um...

155
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:08,849
What's wrong?

156
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,018
Well...

157
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,272
Reika thinks maybe...

158
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:21,361
Miya is being sexually harassed.

159
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,035
Who by?

160
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:32,956
Are you OK?!

161
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,258
You're next.

162
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,261
Yes, sir.

163
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:51,808
Mr Shibahara found out...
I was shoplifting.

164
00:14:54,394 --> 00:15:00,609
I won't tell anyone, he said.
Tell me why you did it.

165
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:03,820
I did...

166
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,075
and he recorded it...

167
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,080
then said put out or else.

168
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,381
Appalling

169
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,551
Really!

170
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,346
You, too.

171
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,519
Seat belt.

172
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,486
Send Shibahara this text.

173
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:50,200
I've apologized to the store, comma...

174
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:54,204
and it's OK now. Period.

175
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,622
However...

176
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,374
Wait...

177
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,212
However, comma...

178
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:07,550
I found out that for
lewd conduct with a minor, comma...

179
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,221
you are the one...

180
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,642
who will get charged. Period.

181
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,563
Is this OK?

182
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,526
Don't worry. He takes the
fall if this gets out.

183
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,170
Don't! Stop it!

184
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,380
You, too.

185
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,091
You stop it.

186
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,242
I'm going home.

187
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:18,788
See you tomorrow. Go straight home.

188
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:34,971
Starting with today's test,
we will collect cell phones.

189
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:40,685
I sympathize, but this
is a faculty decision.

190
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:41,978
Let's have 'em.

191
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:44,898
Thank you.

192
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,649
Give it here.

193
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:48,860
Thank you.

194
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,743
Thank you.

195
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,496
Where's yours?

196
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:01,706
I forgot it.

197
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:05,126
Oh, well...

198
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,815
No service

199
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,579
No service?

200
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:26,332
Maybe there's something
wrong with your phone.

201
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,501
With everyone's?

202
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,754
Now they're all working fine.

203
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,841
They were being jammed.

204
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,176
Jammed?

205
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:39,345
An interference signal.

206
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,516
It can be done.

207
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:48,438
Then why would they bother
confiscating the phones?

208
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:52,150
Someone else was doing it.

209
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,277
Jamming the phones?

210
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:55,570
Who?

211
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:01,743
My home-room teacher, I bet.

212
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,286
Tsurii?

213
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,579
Yeah.

214
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,624
He's staff advisor for the Radio Club.

215
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,584
He's a lurker.

216
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,295
You never know what he's thinking.

217
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:24,724
Since I have you here, I'll say two things.

218
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,603
One...

219
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:33,274
I will overlook this
latest cheating incident.

220
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,069
Learn from that.

221
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,529
And the second...

222
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:43,034
I wasn't jamming the phones.

223
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,579
But someone was.

224
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:51,793
Unless your phones and mine
went on the blink together...

225
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,129
it looks that way.

226
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:56,923
So?

227
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,224
Watch your step.

228
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:38,631
Masanobu Tsurii

229
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,426
The Weather Effect

230
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:46,806
Copycat Suicides

231
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:05,593
In Norse mythology, a pair of ravens
named Huginn and Muninn...

232
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:12,308
patrol the world as agents of Odin.

233
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:18,147
Their names mean thought and memory...

234
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:24,570
These two ravens fly over the Earth...

235
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:30,741
and bring tidings to
Odin, King of the Gods.

236
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,671
Watch your head. Feet first.

237
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:42,422
Whoa!

238
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,340
It's OK. Hang on.

239
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:46,134
Here he comes!

240
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:49,095
Go.

241
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,433
You OK?

242
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,062
Almost there. Take it slow!

243
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,109
I made it!

244
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,120
Confirm the victim is
conscious and breathing.

245
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:18,583
Finally, confirm pulse and breathing.

246
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,209
And that's it.

247
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,961
All right?

248
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,465
Who wants to try?

249
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:26,299
Me!

250
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:30,803
What if you defibrillate
his crotch by mistake?

251
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,305
Hey, wait!

252
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:35,433
It's OK! You might even like it.

253
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,143
Do me.

254
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:48,613
Three, two...

255
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:49,822
one, bam!

256
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:09,258
I never came that much before.

257
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:16,974
Yuck!

258
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,351
Whatever.

259
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:20,645
But don't forget...

260
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:25,858
it records everything
you say when it's in use.

261
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,777
Is that true?!

262
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:33,199
As data to improve treatment in the future.

263
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:36,118
And you're ugly!

264
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:39,747
Uh-oh...

265
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:42,041
Cut it out! Slow down!

266
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,626
Tade!

267
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:47,713
Ow! That hurts!

268
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,216
What a wimp!

269
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:56,597
Loser!

270
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:07,024
So you said there was
no bullying in Year 2 Class 4?

271
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:12,071
You didn't look very hard!

272
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,991
You didn't see that.

273
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:26,127
It's a message board one
of the girls started.

274
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:31,507
It's password-protected
so not everyone can get on.

275
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:36,345
There's a whole world out
there you don't see!

276
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:41,976
See? It's clear there's bullying going on.

277
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:47,523
This is Saori Yokota's site, Mr Kiyota.

278
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,942
There's lots like that.

279
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:54,697
I assume you're taking this
comment by "Tade" as bullying?

280
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:56,449
They're complaining about her!

281
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:57,575
All of them!

282
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,370
This "Tade"...

283
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:06,125
is a student named "Tadenuma".

284
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:09,128
He can be a bit aggressive...

285
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:13,174
but I wouldn't take
criticism on a site like this...

286
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:17,470
is anything more than letting off steam.

287
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:22,016
We all need that, don't we.

288
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:26,687
What?

289
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,026
I'm just here complaining
so I can let off steam?

290
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,364
Not at all.

291
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:42,328
You think you're pretty
smart, you son of a bitch!

292
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,124
Hasumin...

293
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:29,667
Yes, Miya?

294
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,088
Could I see you after school?

295
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:36,465
What's up?

296
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:40,177
I can't say here.

297
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:55,901
What?

298
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:16,881
Hey! What's going on?

299
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,968
I hate that.

300
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,957
Sorry.

301
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,121
Who's there?

302
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:31,098
Did you see?

303
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,811
What?

304
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:42,318
What are you doing?

305
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,529
Just sleeping.

306
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:52,912
It's wet.

307
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,167
Leave me alone.

308
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:12,723
It's OK.

309
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,101
Who was it?

310
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,228
Don't worry about it.

311
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:35,889
Where's Rina?

312
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,063
Hasn't she phoned?!

313
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:55,177
Kerosene?

314
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,805
Yes.

315
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:03,352
He had water bottles out
front to keep cats away.

316
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:06,897
But they'd been filled with kerosene.

317
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:13,112
We think the fire that killed him
started with a butt he'd thrown down.

318
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,988
A cigarette...

319
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,825
He smoked a lot, didn't he.

320
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:21,328
Oh?

321
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:25,415
He'd sit there and chain-smoke.

322
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:26,792
Here?

323
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:30,129
He'd come about his daughter.

324
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:33,924
Right?

325
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:35,676
Yes.

326
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:47,938
Well, at least Rina wasn't hurt.

327
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:53,360
That's the one good thing about it.

328
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:05,372
You're a detective, right?

329
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:07,708
And you are?

330
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:13,005
Tsurii. I teach physics here.

331
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,048
Mr Tsurii?

332
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:19,928
About Mr Hasumi, Rina's
home-room teacher...

333
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:23,682
He's a good teacher. Very enthusiastic.

334
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,434
And handsome.

335
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,022
What about him?

336
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:34,902
He started teaching at
this school last year.

337
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:40,365
Before that he was at
Kitahara Municipal High School.

338
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,243
Yes... and?

339
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:47,289
Kitahara Municipal High School.

340
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,041
- So what?
- Goodbye.

341
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:10,979
What did you tell the cops?

342
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:21,365
That until the year before last,
Mr Hasumi taught at Kitahara High.

343
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:24,743
Kitahara High?

344
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,321
Cool!

345
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,059
What do you mean?!

346
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:57,854
Should I name names, Mr Kume?

347
00:39:58,814 --> 00:40:01,942
All right. Masahiko Maejima.

348
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:08,657
You are involved with a student in
a homosexual relationship.

349
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:09,991
And so...

350
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:12,661
what do you want now?

351
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:16,998
I don't want this brought to light, either.

352
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:25,132
It could affect him emotionally.
Masahiko is sensitive.

353
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:27,342
And a bit conceited.

354
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:31,388
The combination could drive him to suicide.

355
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:36,017
He is also very attached to you, Mr Kume.

356
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:41,022
It's best for him if this is kept secret.

357
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:43,358
And for you as well.

358
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:45,569
You'd lose your teaching license.

359
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:50,073
Your family's prominent, too.
I'd like you to take more care.

360
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,451
This doesn't just involve you.

361
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:56,163
I'm sorry.

362
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:01,084
But how did you find out?

363
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:02,919
That doesn't matter.

364
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:08,884
What is important now is that you admit...

365
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:11,928
that you are an anti-social...

366
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:14,806
pervert.

367
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,476
Which means...

368
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:20,770
your life is in my hands.

369
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:23,315
I'm sure you understand.

370
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:57,390
Wow!

371
00:41:58,475 --> 00:42:00,185
This is too much!

372
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:06,608
Tell me...

373
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,820
who's the friend who
lent you this place?

374
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:14,324
A smart gay, let's say.

375
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:20,872
Shall we shower?

376
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,586
You'd prefer alone?

377
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:31,091
I don't know...

378
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:37,556
What's that?

379
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:41,726
On your back.

380
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:50,819
A scar from an accident when I was a kid.

381
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:56,825
What happened?

382
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:06,167
Nothing worth talking about.

383
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:44,998
Weather effect?

384
00:43:45,582 --> 00:43:48,960
The Sorrows of Young Weather,
the book by Goethe.

385
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:51,713
In the end he shoots himself.

386
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:55,967
A lot of people committed suicide
after it first came out.

387
00:43:56,134 --> 00:44:00,639
So a wave of copycat suicides
is called the "Weather effect".

388
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,434
That happened at Kitahara?

389
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:06,728
There were four of them.

390
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:10,231
Two by hanging, one by jumping,
and one by carbon monoxide.

391
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:11,858
All at the school...

392
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:14,694
when Hasumi was there.

393
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,197
So?

394
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:21,201
Beats me.

395
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:24,037
How would I know?

396
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:27,207
Tsurii told the police...

397
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:32,504
Hasumi was at Kitahara
when the suicides happened.

398
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,967
He was involved?

399
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:42,389
No way!

400
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:46,851
Keisuke...

401
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,690
Drop this.

402
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:52,857
Why?

403
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:55,235
Just stop.

404
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,532
Somehow I feel...

405
00:45:03,702 --> 00:45:05,537
you're in danger.

406
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:08,498
What?

407
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:24,889
Yeah, OK.

408
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:35,942
You piece of shit!

409
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:43,742
Stop it!

410
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:44,534
Don't!

411
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:47,912
Cut it out!

412
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:51,666
Where's Hasumin?

413
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:52,876
What's going on?

414
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:54,836
Yokota's site.

415
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:59,132
MT burned down RK's house

416
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:02,927
Tade burned down Rina's house?!

417
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:05,764
No, but someone posted this.

418
00:46:09,726 --> 00:46:10,894
Who?!

419
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:15,565
Miya...

420
00:46:17,776 --> 00:46:23,281
how many of those message boards
can you get onto?

421
00:46:25,742 --> 00:46:26,826
Hey!

422
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:27,952
Tade!

423
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:31,289
Just between us.

424
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:43,927
Let's have a drink.

425
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:45,053
Huh?

426
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:48,306
You're a teacher.

427
00:46:54,896 --> 00:46:57,315
I know you guys all drink.

428
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:05,573
You get a lot of things that piss you off.

429
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:12,622
We won't go anywhere, where we'll be seen.

430
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:18,086
I'm broke.

431
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:21,506
The grown-up pays, of course.

432
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,511
From his low salary. Don't tell anyone.

433
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:37,355
Let's see your hand.

434
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:40,608
It's fine.

435
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:41,359
Show me.

436
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:43,111
I'm fine.

437
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:59,127
And the shark, it has teeth

438
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:04,883
And it wears them in its face

439
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:10,305
And a knife has Mackie Messer

440
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:15,977
Of the knife one sees no trace

441
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:21,941
On a beautiful blue Sunday

442
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:27,739
Lies a dead man on the Strand

443
00:48:27,906 --> 00:48:33,411
And a man goes round the corner

444
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:38,833
Mackie Messer they call that man

445
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:45,089
And Schmul Meier is missing

446
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:51,095
And many another rich man

447
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:57,185
And Mackie Messer has their money

448
00:48:57,352 --> 00:49:02,774
They can't pin anything on him

449
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:09,155
Jenny Towler was found

450
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:15,119
With a knife in her chest

451
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:21,250
And on the wharf walks Mackie Messer

452
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:27,298
Who knows nothing about all this

453
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:33,137
And the great fire in Soho

454
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:39,310
Burnt to death were seven
children and an old man

455
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:43,898
In the crowd is Mackie Messer...

456
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:47,819
Hello, police? Help!

457
00:49:47,986 --> 00:49:51,781
Who knows nothing, and whom you don't ask

458
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:57,996
And the young widow

459
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:04,210
Whose name everyone knows

460
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:10,675
Woke up with the dirty deed done

461
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:17,181
Mackie, what was your price?

462
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:24,063
Woke up with the dirty deed done

463
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:28,192
Mackie, what was your price?

464
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:27,085
It's just too weird.

465
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:31,255
Will you tell me what
you've found out about Mr Hasumi?

466
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:36,677
All I have is doubts, nothing more.

467
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:38,429
OK...

468
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:41,432
when did you first have doubts?

469
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:44,018
I'm a jerk, right?

470
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,063
Sorry?

471
00:51:48,815 --> 00:51:51,234
When I meet someone outstanding...

472
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:56,614
I soon get feelings of inadequacy
that come bubbling up...

473
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:58,491
from deep down.

474
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:04,705
But I didn't feel any
of that when I met him.

475
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,793
On the surface...

476
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,587
he glitters.

477
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:16,259
But after a month, or even six months...

478
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:20,263
I still didn't hate myself.

479
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:25,434
There's something very strange about that.

480
00:52:27,436 --> 00:52:32,150
So I went through
what I could find from his resume...

481
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:34,819
here at the school.

482
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:36,988
I found

483
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:41,701
it had strange gaps in it.

484
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:47,999
His father was a doctor,
and he was born here in Tokyo.

485
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:52,461
But then for 3rd year middle school...

486
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:54,338
he switched to Kyoto.

487
00:52:55,381 --> 00:53:00,469
He stayed there, and got into Law
at Kyoto University...

488
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,013
but...

489
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:07,476
he dropped out after a month.

490
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:13,191
The next September he went abroad...
to Harvard!

491
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:19,739
What he studied had nothing to
do with becoming an English teacher.

492
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:24,869
He graduated, and took an MBA.

493
00:53:25,036 --> 00:53:30,208
He then went to the North American
head office of Morgenstern.

494
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:31,626
Morgenstern?

495
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:34,128
A European investment bank.

496
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:37,548
But after two years he left...

497
00:53:37,924 --> 00:53:40,718
and came back to Japan.

498
00:53:40,927 --> 00:53:45,598
Then he suddenly changed fields,
and became a teacher.

499
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:49,268
At Kitahara.

500
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:51,312
So what's going on?

501
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:55,858
I started following other
lines of investigation.

502
00:53:56,025 --> 00:54:00,446
His father's Clinic in Toshima Ward
had gone out of business.

503
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:05,868
Dr Hasumi and his wife
had been stabbed to death...

504
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:08,246
by an intruder.

505
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:09,247
His parents?

506
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:10,248
Yes.

507
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:14,085
He was stabbed in the
back and badly wounded.

508
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:19,173
That was in the winter of
2nd year middle school.

509
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:24,595
That made me very interested in

510
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:26,681
the suicides at Kitahara High.

511
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:30,726
Were they really suicides?

512
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:34,897
Or had there been other strange deaths
where he was around?

513
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:43,239
Before his parents died,
his middle-school home-room teacher...

514
00:54:43,406 --> 00:54:48,536
a man named Kumagai,
had been killed in a car crash.

515
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:52,790
I only know about Tokyo.

516
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:59,005
What do you think, Mr Tsurii?

517
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:02,466
About Tade.

518
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:05,886
They say he ran away from home.

519
00:55:06,554 --> 00:55:10,308
What do you think?

520
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,309
Good evening.

521
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:38,979
Good evening.

522
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,150
May I sit there?

523
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:24,900
Mr Tsurii made the sad choice...

524
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:27,069
to take his own life.

525
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:31,240
About this there is something
that must be said.

526
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:35,453
Which is that life itself is precious.

527
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:40,791
Here we go again, you may be thinking.

528
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:46,005
Whenever something like this happens,
our ears are numbed...

529
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:51,135
by talk of the importance of life
at school and in the media.

530
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:03,147
Where is it?!

531
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,350
Excellent!

532
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:57,785
Was it you?

533
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:09,338
Well done, Keisuke Hayami.

534
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:12,132
You're right. I bugged the room.

535
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,135
Did you kill him?

536
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,354
Keisuke?

537
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:29,650
Keisuke?

538
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:51,755
Sir?

539
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:54,800
Sorry.

540
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:57,761
I didn't want anyone to see.

541
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:01,515
What's up?

542
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:04,768
Have you seen Keisuke?

543
01:00:05,394 --> 01:00:06,437
Keisuke?

544
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,939
Keisuke Hayami?

545
01:00:09,732 --> 01:00:12,026
No, I haven't. Why?

546
01:00:16,447 --> 01:00:17,781
Nothing.

547
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:38,946
Soldering irons are great things, you know.

548
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:44,743
They can seal a wound shut
so you don't get the floor dirty.

549
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:49,915
Visually it's not great, though.

550
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:55,129
It leaves holes all over
the skin, like a beehive.

551
01:01:56,672 --> 01:01:58,215
It's disgusting.

552
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:40,466
You know why I have this, right?

553
01:02:43,886 --> 01:02:46,764
Nod for "yes", shake your head for "no".

554
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:48,891
Is that clear Mr. Hayami?

555
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:53,061
Bad, boy

556
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:03,697
First question.

557
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:07,242
The cheating...

558
01:03:07,785 --> 01:03:09,495
which was very cunning...

559
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:11,789
You ran that.

560
01:03:25,803 --> 01:03:27,179
Right?

561
01:03:32,226 --> 01:03:35,354
Nod for "yes", shake your head for "no".

562
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:41,485
I see.

563
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:47,533
So you were the ringleader,
and these were your...

564
01:03:49,952 --> 01:03:51,328
accomplices?

565
01:03:59,545 --> 01:04:05,008
You may not want to tell on them,
but I won't do anything right away.

566
01:04:05,676 --> 01:04:07,386
So relax.

567
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:14,142
This is so we can guide
our students better.

568
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:18,730
It's them, right?

569
01:04:24,945 --> 01:04:28,073
Hey, Mr. Hayami, Yes or No?

570
01:04:39,126 --> 01:04:40,043
Now...

571
01:04:43,297 --> 01:04:44,965
to the big question.

572
01:04:46,592 --> 01:04:53,307
Have you told anyone
what you heard from Mr Tsurii?

573
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:32,763
You were superb, Keisuke Hayami.

574
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:38,769
All those holes, and you wouldn't talk.

575
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:42,940
Or maybe you hadn't told anyone.

576
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:49,947
Anyway, as a teacher, I
am proud to have had...

577
01:05:50,781 --> 01:05:53,492
a student like you.

578
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,411
Nice, that's "Mack The Knife".

579
01:05:57,788 --> 01:05:58,872
Nope

580
01:06:00,082 --> 01:06:01,249
Moritat.

581
01:06:03,043 --> 01:06:07,005
Breech’s, The Threepenny Opera has... music

582
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:08,632
Yeah, I know.

583
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:16,390
Mack The Knife is the jazz
version of "Moritat".

584
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:39,538
Lyrics are little different.

585
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:46,378
But it's still a song about
a fucking killer too..

586
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:50,507
It's MY theme song.

587
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,304
You've killed a few, haven't you?

588
01:06:58,724 --> 01:07:01,184
I spot people like you a mile away.

589
01:07:12,821 --> 01:07:14,448
I'm right, aren't I?

590
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:17,367
Let's be partners.

591
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:14,424
It's over, CLAY.

592
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:20,263
You like killing for pleasure. Ha?

593
01:08:24,935 --> 01:08:26,311
Not me.

594
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:36,279
You take the blame...

595
01:08:37,405 --> 01:08:39,533
and a fucking burn.

596
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:01,596
Mr. Hasumi...

597
01:09:04,975 --> 01:09:06,184
Vincent

598
01:09:06,977 --> 01:09:08,603
has done an unfortunate thing.

599
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:12,190
As you can see

600
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:15,277
suicide.

601
01:09:16,278 --> 01:09:18,113
There's even a will.

602
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:20,073
It's real.

603
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:26,705
You will testify. Because you get the
honor of being the first witness.

604
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:31,251
If I refuse?

605
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:34,087
You can't refuse.

606
01:09:42,387 --> 01:09:44,815
Your name and fingerprints
will be on the

607
01:09:44,828 --> 01:09:47,267
blacklist with the United
State immigration.

608
01:09:48,602 --> 01:09:51,688
You'll never be able to
step foot into this country again.

609
01:09:55,317 --> 01:09:56,568
Listen son

610
01:09:57,652 --> 01:10:02,199
I plan on retiring quietly. Very quietly.

611
01:10:06,328 --> 01:10:07,996
Don't ever come back.

612
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:09,456
You know...

613
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:13,460
this world is only for ambitious and
money-hungry criminals.

614
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,713
Not psychotic killers...

615
01:11:03,927 --> 01:11:08,014
I could kill you anytime, Muninn.

616
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:20,944
You hardly ever answer
your cell phone, do you.

617
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:22,362
I don't?

618
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,950
I don't know what you
do when I'm not around.

619
01:11:27,409 --> 01:11:28,618
Does it bother you?

620
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:37,419
Not really.

621
01:12:38,355 --> 01:12:39,564
What is it?

622
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:43,651
Why...

623
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:50,408
do you have Tade's cell phone?

624
01:12:57,374 --> 01:12:59,084
We went out drinking.

625
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:03,880
When?

626
01:13:09,219 --> 01:13:13,306
The day of the fight.

627
01:13:17,477 --> 01:13:22,732
He acts all grown-up, but
he can't hold his liquor.

628
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:25,944
He forgot his cell phone.

629
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:39,874
Tell me...

630
01:13:42,961 --> 01:13:47,549
who do you think left that message?

631
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:56,433
About Tade putting kerosene
around Rina's house?

632
01:13:58,601 --> 01:13:59,978
What do you think?

633
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:12,365
I don't know.

634
01:14:28,131 --> 01:14:32,469
Final notice: I don't want to
be Shibahara's slave any more.

635
01:14:32,844 --> 01:14:36,097
I am unclean in body and soul.

636
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:47,150
The only thing I can do
is leave this body. Miya.

637
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:50,320
Milk Bar

638
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:54,824
I want a crepe, but this is Chinese food.

639
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:58,745
Sweet-and-sour pork. That's what I want.

640
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:00,079
Work hard.

641
01:15:00,497 --> 01:15:01,706
Sweet-and-sour.

642
01:15:02,332 --> 01:15:05,668
This is the Year 2 Class 4 classroom.

643
01:15:06,753 --> 01:15:08,087
Yay!

644
01:15:09,923 --> 01:15:10,924
Hell.

645
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:14,511
Don't film me!

646
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:18,348
Whoa!

647
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:21,851
What do we have inside?

648
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:25,897
Hands growing out of the wall.

649
01:15:26,064 --> 01:15:29,984
The 2-4 House of Horrors
is under construction.

650
01:15:30,151 --> 01:15:33,404
Work is steadily falling behind schedule.

651
01:15:33,655 --> 01:15:35,490
Will they be done in time?

652
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:38,409
Whoa!

653
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:40,495
That was a scare.

654
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,583
Ms Kashiwabara, how is work progressing?

655
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:48,378
Uh...

656
01:15:48,545 --> 01:15:51,297
There's lots to do, but we're trying.

657
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:51,965
Yes!

658
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:54,926
Great! I got your "yes!"

659
01:15:55,093 --> 01:15:58,721
Hisashi! Put that thing down and help!

660
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:01,391
This is the "making of' video!

661
01:16:01,558 --> 01:16:04,811
For future generations
when the festival's over.

662
01:16:04,978 --> 01:16:06,020
For what?

663
01:16:06,187 --> 01:16:08,106
Yuck! That's disgusting!

664
01:16:08,273 --> 01:16:09,899
Something's going on!

665
01:16:11,192 --> 01:16:12,235
Let me see.

666
01:16:15,196 --> 01:16:16,281
What do you think?

667
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:19,242
Rina?!

668
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:21,035
Rina!

669
01:16:21,286 --> 01:16:23,830
Has Rina Kiyota returned?

670
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:25,873
You'll be here next term?

671
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:26,749
Yes.

672
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,418
Great!

673
01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:31,421
Are you staying all night tonight?

674
01:16:31,588 --> 01:16:32,463
Yes.

675
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:35,008
A comment, please.

676
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:38,052
Uh... no comment.

677
01:16:40,013 --> 01:16:43,349
Hasumin! Rina's back.

678
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:47,270
I'm fine now.

679
01:16:52,692 --> 01:16:56,070
You know what our class is making?

680
01:16:56,237 --> 01:16:56,946
What?

681
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:57,947
Look.

682
01:16:58,531 --> 01:17:00,491
A house of horrors!

683
01:17:02,452 --> 01:17:03,202
She's lonely.

684
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:05,330
Yeah, you're right.

685
01:17:06,456 --> 01:17:07,665
Settle down!

686
01:17:08,249 --> 01:17:09,834
Who's here from Class 4?

687
01:17:10,418 --> 01:17:12,670
Everyone, I think.

688
01:17:13,296 --> 01:17:15,965
Except Tade.

689
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:19,427
Don't start trouble.

690
01:17:21,054 --> 01:17:22,680
Is Shibahara...

691
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:26,225
still hitting on Miya?

692
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:28,227
I don't know.

693
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:31,731
He's the duty teacher.

694
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:35,735
He'll be here with us all night.

695
01:17:36,444 --> 01:17:38,738
You think he'll try something again?

696
01:17:38,905 --> 01:17:39,781
There she is.

697
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:44,744
He told her...

698
01:17:45,745 --> 01:17:47,372
to come see him?!

699
01:17:48,206 --> 01:17:49,332
Come on!

700
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:51,709
I'll stay here.

701
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:54,337
You're not worried?

702
01:17:58,841 --> 01:17:59,676
Hasumin?

703
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:01,302
Lock it

704
01:18:09,811 --> 01:18:14,524
Can we send Yuzuka that picture from
Tade's cell phone?

705
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:17,151
The one of them both.

706
01:18:18,528 --> 01:18:20,488
When Rina showed up...

707
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:25,993
she said,
With Tade the whole class would be here...

708
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,913
and got all teary-eyed.

709
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:32,458
I don't think we should
show that to Yuzuka.

710
01:18:34,794 --> 01:18:37,255
It might make things harder?

711
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:41,134
What's that?

712
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:10,246
What... are...

713
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:15,710
Giving Mr Shibahara a gift.

714
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:28,264
Hasun.

715
01:19:28,848 --> 01:19:29,932
Min...

716
01:19:31,434 --> 01:19:33,060
It's OK.

717
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:59,128
Whoa! Don't do that!

718
01:20:00,755 --> 01:20:01,672
Hasumin?

719
01:20:03,466 --> 01:20:04,467
Where's Miya?

720
01:20:06,344 --> 01:20:07,553
Miya?

721
01:20:11,599 --> 01:20:12,642
Miya?

722
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:14,560
Miya?

723
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:57,580
Kume speaking.

724
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:01,000
It's Hasumi. Where are you?

725
01:22:01,626 --> 01:22:02,710
At home.

726
01:22:02,877 --> 01:22:05,129
You can be here in 30 minutes.

727
01:22:05,338 --> 01:22:06,172
Hurry.

728
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:10,051
There's trouble. It's Masahiko.

729
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:14,013
Masahiko

730
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:23,981
We're sorry, but your call
cannot be completed...

731
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:25,524
Here.

732
01:22:29,236 --> 01:22:30,446
Thanks.

733
01:22:35,409 --> 01:22:36,786
No service?

734
01:22:48,798 --> 01:22:49,548
Satomi?

735
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:51,842
Do you have a minute?

736
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:55,304
I'd like to talk to you.

737
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:57,139
Talk to me?

738
01:22:57,473 --> 01:22:59,308
Sure. What about?

739
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:01,227
Could we...

740
01:23:01,978 --> 01:23:04,355
talk in the Club Room?

741
01:23:07,858 --> 01:23:10,069
Can I finish this first?

742
01:23:10,653 --> 01:23:13,823
Sure. There's no rush.

743
01:23:32,049 --> 01:23:33,342
Holy shit!

744
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:53,029
Wow!

745
01:23:57,742 --> 01:23:58,534
Mr Hasumi?

746
01:23:58,701 --> 01:23:59,869
Over here.

747
01:24:12,339 --> 01:24:14,675
Do you have service?

748
01:24:14,842 --> 01:24:15,593
MY Phone?

749
01:24:20,431 --> 01:24:22,975
No service. Why?

750
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:25,770
Jamming?

751
01:24:30,149 --> 01:24:31,400
Hasumin.

752
01:24:32,777 --> 01:24:34,779
What's going on?

753
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:40,326
Wow!

754
01:24:40,493 --> 01:24:41,952
That's great, sir!

755
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:44,038
Play with us at the festival.

756
01:24:44,789 --> 01:24:46,248
Who, me?

757
01:24:46,957 --> 01:24:49,126
You're really good!

758
01:24:51,629 --> 01:24:52,797
Buy some juice.

759
01:24:52,963 --> 01:24:53,672
Yeah?

760
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:55,508
Thanks!

761
01:24:55,674 --> 01:25:01,806
Is it true you guys and Hayami
were cheating with cell phones?

762
01:25:02,473 --> 01:25:04,433
So what?

763
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:08,521
And all the phones said
"no service" then, too?

764
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:17,404
I had Shibahara all wrong.

765
01:25:17,571 --> 01:25:18,322
Yeah!

766
01:25:18,489 --> 01:25:19,949
He should play.

767
01:25:20,116 --> 01:25:21,158
Will he?

768
01:25:21,408 --> 01:25:23,661
We'll talk him into it.

769
01:25:23,828 --> 01:25:26,122
You should hear Mr Shibahara!

770
01:25:26,288 --> 01:25:28,791
All of you, stay where you are.

771
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:34,046
Uh, sir...

772
01:25:34,255 --> 01:25:38,217
Wait... you're from Class 1.

773
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:45,808
Sir, is that a...

774
01:26:36,066 --> 01:26:37,234
Hasumi?

775
01:26:41,906 --> 01:26:43,240
What the fuck?!

776
01:26:58,923 --> 01:26:59,882
Miya?

777
01:27:05,179 --> 01:27:07,848
I heard a noise.

778
01:27:12,478 --> 01:27:15,564
Move! Turn off the music!

779
01:27:15,856 --> 01:27:16,565
Turn it off!

780
01:27:23,072 --> 01:27:24,198
What's wrong?

781
01:27:32,748 --> 01:27:37,086
Your attention, please.
There is an intruder in the school.

782
01:27:37,253 --> 01:27:40,047
I repeat, we have an intruder.

783
01:27:40,214 --> 01:27:43,509
He is dangerous. Do not
go to the 1st floor.

784
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:47,846
Do not panic. Remain calm.

785
01:27:48,222 --> 01:27:52,017
Get to the top floor. The
intruder has a shotgun.

786
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:56,230
Go to the roof, lock the
door, and wait for help.

787
01:28:07,283 --> 01:28:08,742
A shotgun?

788
01:28:10,286 --> 01:28:11,620
No way!

789
01:28:14,999 --> 01:28:16,500
Let's do what he said!

790
01:28:16,667 --> 01:28:19,545
Wait a minute!

791
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:21,171
Something's weird.

792
01:28:21,338 --> 01:28:23,340
Hasumin's on the 1st floor!

793
01:28:23,632 --> 01:28:24,883
He could get hurt!

794
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:25,634
No!

795
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:28,345
Maybe we can't trust him!

796
01:28:28,846 --> 01:28:30,139
Tell them!

797
01:28:44,153 --> 01:28:44,945
Stay here!

798
01:28:45,112 --> 01:28:47,698
How's that going to help?!

799
01:28:49,033 --> 01:28:50,534
I'm trusting Hasumin.

800
01:28:50,701 --> 01:28:51,577
Let go!

801
01:28:54,038 --> 01:28:57,708
Go to the top floor. The
intruder has a shotgun.

802
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:02,004
Go to the roof, lock the
door, and wait for help.

803
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:06,175
We need to go!

804
01:29:09,178 --> 01:29:17,178
United we stand, divided we fall.

805
01:29:21,982 --> 01:29:24,485
Had I taught them that yet?

806
01:29:25,819 --> 01:29:26,695
Come on!

807
01:29:28,197 --> 01:29:29,281
What's wrong?!

808
01:29:29,823 --> 01:29:31,033
Kakeru's downstairs.

809
01:29:32,201 --> 01:29:33,952
Maybe he got shot.

810
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:34,995
Where?!

811
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:46,131
Satomi...

812
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:48,050
Quick!

813
01:29:50,344 --> 01:29:51,220
Hurry!

814
01:29:54,181 --> 01:29:54,765
Open it!

815
01:29:54,932 --> 01:29:56,517
It's locked!

816
01:29:56,934 --> 01:29:57,684
Wait!

817
01:29:57,851 --> 01:30:00,312
Someone outside locked it!

818
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:01,480
Ayumi?

819
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:04,858
Is anyone out there?! Open up!

820
01:30:05,025 --> 01:30:05,984
Miya!

821
01:30:06,485 --> 01:30:09,655
What about trying a landline?

822
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:11,240
The pay phone?

823
01:30:11,532 --> 01:30:13,450
Or in the staff room.

824
01:30:14,034 --> 01:30:15,619
Let's split up.

825
01:30:17,663 --> 01:30:18,497
Hurry!

826
01:30:18,997 --> 01:30:23,085
If he gets Kakeru, we haven't got a chance!

827
01:30:31,844 --> 01:30:33,011
Naoki...

828
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:41,353
Satomi!

829
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:44,106
Satomi!

830
01:30:45,023 --> 01:30:45,899
It's OK.

831
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:47,818
Stay here.

832
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:58,454
Let's close the fire shutters
and build a barricade.

833
01:32:06,855 --> 01:32:08,106
It's dead!

834
01:32:17,241 --> 01:32:19,034
We can't call help!

835
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:26,959
Come on!

836
01:32:39,638 --> 01:32:40,389
Don't shoot!

837
01:32:41,223 --> 01:32:42,599
Don't shoot!

838
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:45,602
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

839
01:32:55,612 --> 01:32:56,780
Don't shoot!

840
01:33:34,901 --> 01:33:38,697
It's not very likely you'll
get two with one shot.

841
01:33:40,157 --> 01:33:41,575
Why?!

842
01:33:41,783 --> 01:33:45,245
Why are you doing this, Hasumin?!

843
01:33:49,124 --> 01:33:51,126
This is Mr Kume's doing.

844
01:34:01,136 --> 01:34:04,306
It's no good us all bunched up like this!

845
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:06,141
Split up and hide!

846
01:34:06,308 --> 01:34:06,892
Suzuki!

847
01:34:07,351 --> 01:34:09,478
Let him go!

848
01:34:09,686 --> 01:34:10,687
But...

849
01:34:13,482 --> 01:34:14,566
I'm going, too.

850
01:34:14,983 --> 01:34:15,734
Miho!

851
01:34:15,901 --> 01:34:17,027
Me, too!

852
01:34:21,531 --> 01:34:24,785
You fool! What are you doing?!

853
01:34:26,662 --> 01:34:28,205
Don't call me a fool.

854
01:34:28,372 --> 01:34:28,955
Hey!

855
01:34:29,331 --> 01:34:32,334
Quick! Move it!

856
01:34:36,630 --> 01:34:37,506
Masahiko!

857
01:34:54,731 --> 01:34:57,150
Miya Yasuhara

858
01:35:17,629 --> 01:35:19,131
Hey, Partner!

859
01:35:33,103 --> 01:35:34,104
Hey, partner!

860
01:35:34,938 --> 01:35:38,400
How about a little more enthusiasm.

861
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:45,407
Mack The Knife

862
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:28,825
Who's there?

863
01:36:31,244 --> 01:36:32,370
Hasumin...

864
01:36:38,126 --> 01:36:39,169
Hasumin?

865
01:36:39,336 --> 01:36:40,462
Madoka?

866
01:36:47,344 --> 01:36:48,678
Hasumin!

867
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:51,515
We did what you told us, sir!

868
01:37:24,297 --> 01:37:24,923
Why?

869
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:46,695
Hasumin!

870
01:38:06,089 --> 01:38:06,882
Stop!

871
01:38:11,052 --> 01:38:13,889
Hasumin! Why?

872
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:27,582
Why didn't you close the window, stupid!

873
01:41:31,878 --> 01:41:34,631
It's your fault! It serves you right!

874
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:06,621
Taden.

875
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:11,292
Tade's dead, isn't he.

876
01:42:16,047 --> 01:42:18,007
You killed him, didn't you!

877
01:42:28,643 --> 01:42:30,937
Hey! Call the police!

878
01:42:31,146 --> 01:42:32,605
Call the police!

879
01:42:32,772 --> 01:42:34,190
What?!

880
01:42:34,357 --> 01:42:36,109
Call the police!

881
01:42:36,276 --> 01:42:38,153
There's a guy at the school...

882
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:39,654
with a shotgun!

883
01:42:39,821 --> 01:42:40,989
That school?

884
01:42:41,489 --> 01:42:43,074
Your student card...

885
01:42:45,618 --> 01:42:46,995
Hurry!

886
01:42:47,495 --> 01:42:49,122
OK, I'm calling!

887
01:42:49,289 --> 01:42:50,498
Hang on!

888
01:42:53,001 --> 01:42:55,211
Hello? Is this the police?

889
01:42:55,378 --> 01:42:59,132
There's a man with a gun at
a high school near here.

890
01:42:59,382 --> 01:43:01,009
A shotgun!

891
01:43:02,802 --> 01:43:04,179
At Shinko Academy.

892
01:43:10,518 --> 01:43:12,020
I'm taking...

893
01:43:12,437 --> 01:43:13,688
Satomi...

894
01:43:16,941 --> 01:43:18,026
with me.

895
01:43:28,244 --> 01:43:28,744
Satomi!

896
01:43:31,706 --> 01:43:33,708
He said the Club Room.

897
01:43:37,128 --> 01:43:38,296
No way!

898
01:43:39,255 --> 01:43:40,256
Way, maybe.

899
01:43:43,218 --> 01:43:44,969
It might work.

900
01:43:46,846 --> 01:43:48,139
She's the guinea pig?

901
01:43:49,182 --> 01:43:50,475
Are you nuts?!

902
01:43:52,602 --> 01:43:53,895
Satomi...

903
01:44:07,659 --> 01:44:10,161
Don't! It'll never work!

904
01:44:14,374 --> 01:44:15,541
Yukio?

905
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:20,546
Is that you?

906
01:44:23,716 --> 01:44:24,425
Yes.

907
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:13,975
Satomi!

908
01:45:36,664 --> 01:45:37,373
Satomi!

909
01:45:53,681 --> 01:45:55,224
Kakeru!

910
01:47:02,959 --> 01:47:03,960
Kakeru!

911
01:47:06,587 --> 01:47:07,338
Hey bro

912
01:47:08,589 --> 01:47:10,925
Looks like we're out of time...

913
01:47:38,119 --> 01:47:39,328
Oh, shit!

914
01:47:50,756 --> 01:47:53,259
No, we're OK.

915
01:47:53,801 --> 01:47:58,055
It's a fire shutter. That's what it's for.

916
01:47:59,765 --> 01:48:01,309
That's right.

917
01:48:02,894 --> 01:48:06,105
We'll get help before it's too late.

918
01:48:06,564 --> 01:48:07,648
I know it.

919
01:48:08,274 --> 01:48:11,903
We just have to hang in till then.

920
01:48:34,425 --> 01:48:39,639
Why didn't anyone untie that?!

921
01:48:40,598 --> 01:48:42,725
Why didn't you?!

922
01:48:43,768 --> 01:48:44,936
Shut up!

923
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:48,523
Someone untie it!

924
01:48:49,649 --> 01:48:50,816
Go on!

925
01:48:52,068 --> 01:48:56,531
It's that stupid cow's fault
for going out that way!

926
01:48:58,950 --> 01:49:02,245
You said it might work!

927
01:49:05,748 --> 01:49:06,832
Fuck you!

928
01:49:10,878 --> 01:49:12,213
Hasumin...

929
01:49:29,397 --> 01:49:30,147
Stay back!

930
01:49:39,949 --> 01:49:41,242
Keep away!

931
01:50:02,221 --> 01:50:05,099
Out of my Way!

932
01:50:33,127 --> 01:50:34,295
Reika!

933
01:50:42,470 --> 01:50:43,721
Shit!

934
01:50:47,975 --> 01:50:49,060
Sir...

935
01:50:57,193 --> 01:51:03,491
I have to get into Todai University...

936
01:51:06,661 --> 01:51:07,620
To die?

937
01:51:16,712 --> 01:51:17,546
The chute.

938
01:51:18,339 --> 01:51:19,006
Chute?

939
01:51:19,215 --> 01:51:21,717
The emergency-escape chute.

940
01:51:22,218 --> 01:51:27,181
He'd see it as soon as we put it down!

941
01:51:30,351 --> 01:51:31,727
Wait...

942
01:51:32,853 --> 01:51:35,189
That just might work.

943
01:51:36,565 --> 01:51:37,400
Come on!

944
01:52:08,597 --> 01:52:09,724
No time to think.

945
01:52:11,726 --> 01:52:13,644
Shit!

946
01:52:18,441 --> 01:52:20,234
Sorry, Tohru!

947
01:52:21,736 --> 01:52:24,405
But I've got to do this!

948
01:52:24,572 --> 01:52:25,781
Yuichiro?

949
01:52:32,121 --> 01:52:33,080
Reika...

950
01:52:34,457 --> 01:52:35,916
trust me.

951
01:52:37,418 --> 01:52:38,794
Do what I say.

952
01:52:43,799 --> 01:52:44,592
OK.

953
01:52:58,773 --> 01:53:00,649
Whose shoes are these?

954
01:53:07,531 --> 01:53:10,117
You're going to frame Mr Kume?

955
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:12,787
Great!

956
01:53:14,955 --> 01:53:20,169
I warned him to keep his
hands off the students.

957
01:53:21,295 --> 01:53:22,797
No matter...

958
01:53:26,175 --> 01:53:28,010
how beautiful.

959
01:53:30,346 --> 01:53:35,309
Mr Kume went crazy and,
taking all the students with him...

960
01:53:36,811 --> 01:53:39,355
committed love-suicide with you.

961
01:53:41,065 --> 01:53:45,236
That's a pretty wild story, though.

962
01:53:47,822 --> 01:53:48,614
That's crazy...

963
01:56:13,801 --> 01:56:15,135
That's everyone.

964
01:56:17,304 --> 01:56:18,973
Happy graduation.

965
01:57:28,042 --> 01:57:33,047
Mr Kume, the Art teacher,
was involved with a male student.

966
01:57:33,213 --> 01:57:39,887
He entered the school with a shotgun,
attacked and handcuffed me...

967
01:57:40,054 --> 01:57:40,763
and then...

968
01:57:44,224 --> 01:57:49,563
shot the students,
the Gym teacher, and himself.

969
01:58:09,625 --> 01:58:17,625
A girl the Gym teacher had harassed
also threw herself off the roof.

970
01:58:26,183 --> 01:58:30,437
But it might be hard to
fit that into the story.

971
01:58:32,231 --> 01:58:34,983
Anyway, there's no need to think too hard.

972
01:58:37,444 --> 01:58:43,117
It's not me who has to
think up a simple explanation.

973
01:58:45,410 --> 01:58:47,454
It's the police.

974
01:59:15,983 --> 01:59:16,650
Here.

975
01:59:17,151 --> 01:59:18,735
Thanks!

976
01:59:28,829 --> 01:59:30,164
Two survivors!

977
01:59:58,567 --> 01:59:59,860
You two...

978
02:00:04,198 --> 02:00:08,827
I can't believe you managed
to live through that.

979
02:00:12,706 --> 02:00:17,294
As your home-room teacher,
I'm proud of you.

980
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:30,390
You son of a bitch! Go
fuck yourself, Hasumi!

981
02:00:30,557 --> 02:00:32,142
You did it! All of it!

982
02:00:32,893 --> 02:00:34,102
Fuck you, Hasumi!

983
02:00:35,687 --> 02:00:37,189
He's the one who did it!

984
02:00:38,273 --> 02:00:39,816
You bastard!

985
02:00:40,108 --> 02:00:42,069
Hasumi!

986
02:00:43,403 --> 02:00:44,446
Cut it out!

987
02:00:44,696 --> 02:00:47,407
Stay away from me, Hasumi!

988
02:00:48,408 --> 02:00:49,868
You bastard!

989
02:00:50,202 --> 02:00:51,870
Hasumi!

990
02:01:04,258 --> 02:01:05,926
The proof was in...

991
02:01:08,428 --> 02:01:09,680
the nurse's office.

992
02:01:16,687 --> 02:01:20,023
Hey! Don't touch that!

993
02:01:23,610 --> 02:01:25,028
Replayil'19-

994
02:01:26,780 --> 02:01:30,117
It's not very likely you'll
get two with one shot.

995
02:01:32,119 --> 02:01:33,328
Why?!

996
02:01:33,870 --> 02:01:37,291
Why are you doing this, Hasumin?!

997
02:01:37,958 --> 02:01:39,710
This is Mr Kume's doing.

998
02:02:04,693 --> 02:02:06,987
Keisuke's alive, right?

999
02:02:13,035 --> 02:02:14,995
He's alive, right?

1000
02:02:15,829 --> 02:02:17,331
Right?!

1001
02:02:35,140 --> 02:02:36,308
I'm sorry.

1002
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:44,358
I'm really sorry.

1003
02:02:51,615 --> 02:02:55,660
This was all the will of God.

1004
02:02:58,872 --> 02:03:01,541
He gave me orders.

1005
02:03:06,171 --> 02:03:10,884
I had to kill everyone,
all the demons in Class 4...

1006
02:03:12,886 --> 02:03:15,555
to save their souls...

1007
02:03:16,890 --> 02:03:17,891
Muninn.

1008
02:03:39,413 --> 02:03:41,415
Say hello to Odin for me.

1009
02:03:45,085 --> 02:03:46,586
God's will?

1010
02:03:50,590 --> 02:03:51,842
He's crazy.

1011
02:03:53,552 --> 02:03:57,931
The bastard's completely crazy!

1012
02:04:00,976 --> 02:04:02,185
No.

1013
02:04:04,479 --> 02:04:05,730
No?

1014
02:04:07,774 --> 02:04:12,821
He's just starting the next game.

1015
02:04:22,664 --> 02:04:26,376
Magnificent!

1016
02:04:39,139 --> 02:04:41,099
Let's go, partner.

1017
02:04:42,767 --> 02:04:46,354
No way we will be found responsible...

1018
02:05:18,845 --> 02:05:19,846
Hasumin...
