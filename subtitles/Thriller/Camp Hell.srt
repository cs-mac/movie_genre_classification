00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,900
Camp Hope

3
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,700
Holy Mother, the soul of my father
rest gives Romeo Garbollato.

4
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,500
May the tortures of purgatory
spared him ...

5
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,200
and must be received in the bosom
of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

6
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,200
Amen.
- Amen.

7
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,200
Praise the Lord.

8
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Are your things packed up, boy?
- I have your asthma medication.

9
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,700
Yes, I'm almost done.
- Is grandpa in heaven now?

10
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,900
I hope so, sweetheart.
But, every day ...

11
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
we should count our blessings
and say our prayers ...

12
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,000
so he can leave purgatory
and can go to Heaven.

13
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,300
What is purgatory?
- Tell your sister what purgatory is.

14
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,700
Purgatory is a place where those suffering
that sinful dead.

15
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,400
Or who have not atoned for their actions.

16
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,300
I do not understand what he just said.

17
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,600
Thank you, dear.

18
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,200
Neither do I.
Purgatory is like prison.

19
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,300
A place where you go
to cleanse his soul ...

20
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,900
so we are ready to meet God.

21
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,200
I also have to purgatory?
- Everyone goes there.

22
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,200
No, honey, you're a good girl.
You are God's girl.

23
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,800
In the world outside people want
take away from you.

24
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,500
Your right to go to heaven.
Therefore, every day kneel ...

25
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,400
Tommy goes to hell.
- Rose, that's not nice.

26
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,900
It's true. If he needs me to fit
if you were to meet ...

27
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,300
I asked him to bed so
He can talk with his girlfriend.

28
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,800
And the community says it's a sin
to have a girlfriend.

29
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,100
He does, I swear.
- Shut up, Rose.

30
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,800
Do not say 'shut up' to your sister.

31
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,900
And no cursing, young lady.

32
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,100
It's no sin to a friend
to have.

33
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,600
Your brother is just too young.

34
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,000
When can I go to camp?
- If you're older, but now to bed.

35
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,700
I have yet to pack.

36
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,100
I hate you.

37
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,700
Hello, Father Phineas McAllister,
I come to see Daniel Jacobs.

38
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,300
Yes, Father.

39
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,600
Father McAllister is here,
for his appointment with Daniel Jacobs.

40
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,500
<i> Department of Psychiatry
Unit 3 </ i></i>

41
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,800
Hello, Daniel.

42
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,200
How did it go this week?

43
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,400
Have you eaten?

44
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,400
Daniel?

45
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,300
You can not hide forever for me.

46
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,700
It is now more than six months.

47
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,500
Daniel?

48
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,200
Can you hear me, son?

49
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,300
The next two weeks I am gone.

50
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,500
I go to camp with the kids
of the community.

51
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,300
Daniel? May I see?

52
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,800
May I see your book?

53
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,500
Please?

54
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,300
Daniel, listen to me.

55
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,200
There is hope.

56
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,300
I told you several times
offered.

57
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,300
Take help of which you are.

58
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,700
I'm doomed, Father.

59
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,500
And you, my priest, have failed.

60
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,700
As you have always failed.

61
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,600
No.
- Yes, you have failed.

62
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,100
You have failed.

63
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,400
You leave no impressions on the world,
only scars.

64
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,700
You have failed yourself and your sister betrayed
because you do not trust in God.

65
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,800
Are you happy with your life, Father?

66
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,100
Are you proud of your achievements?

67
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,600
I am a servant of the Lord.

68
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,900
Nothing happens on earth without
God's permission?

69
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,900
Nothing.

70
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
I hate God.

71
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,700
That you should also.

72
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:24,700
I read the Old Testament,
the book of Tobias.

73
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,300
The devil, Asmodeus, seven killed
men's intervention before God ...

74
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,400
archangel Rafael and sends Asmodues
stop.

75
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,400
Seven men.

76
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That is the will of God.

77
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,600
There is no hope.

78
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,100
There is only the will of God.

79
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,200
Daniel, please.

80
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,100
Your time is over.

81
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,800
And you will see me, after today,
no more.

82
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,600
That is the will of God.

83
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,400
It is God's will.

84
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,700
Goodbye, Father.

85
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,500
Daniel?

86
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,000
Did you this, folks?

87
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,900
These extremist, Islamic
fascists ...

88
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,300
Using children as a distraction ...

89
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,000
to pass military checkpoints
light, and then their car bombs.

90
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,100
These are the kind of animals we
face.

91
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,600
And it gets worse every day.

92
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,100
Do not ask me, just look ...

93
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,900
Thank you.

94
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,600
Go to hell.
God is a loser.

95
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,300
Welcome
Camp Hope

96
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,700
Okay, we're there.
Come here, I will pray for you.

97
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,500
Jesus, You are our hope.

98
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,200
Please find your way to the heart
my son.

99
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,900
Make a man of him,
a fighter for your Kingdom.

100
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,400
Keep the Devil and all his demons
far away from him ...

101
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,900
and protect it for sin
of meat.

102
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,200
We ask all this in Your name.
- And, please, Dad, watch over him.

103
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,600
I'll give it to the nurse.

104
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,300
You do not go to jail.
What's going on?

105
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,700
It goes well.
- Just try to have fun.

106
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,600
It is simply camp.

107
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,800
Concentration camp.

108
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,100
They still have the camp party, right?

109
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,300
Maybe one can dance with Melissa.

110
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,500
I love you.

111
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,800
Hello Brother Jack.
John.

112
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,600
Hey, brother, how are you?

113
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,000
It goes well.

114
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,800
How are you, John?
- I've lost all my clients ...

115
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,700
tell your friends about us.
- I'm sorry for you.

116
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,500
Thank you, Dad.

117
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,600
Behave you.
-Be good, boys.

118
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,400
We love you, sweetheart.

119
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,400
I'll sit back saddled
Jimmy.

120
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,400
Is that a problem, brother?

121
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,100
It looks as though we
bunk areas, Tommy.

122
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,700
There would appear so.

123
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,100
Hallelujah, brother.
- Hallelujah.

124
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,600
Welcome again to serve one year
and learning at Camp Hope.

125
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,900
I'm Christian Bonderman,
I am your pastoral service.

126
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,800
Some of you know me already,
as a youth leader from home.

127
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,200
Everyone here has high school
completed.

128
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,600
Everyone has done volunteer work
for young adults.

129
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,300
We all know the rules that
we should stick ...

130
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,200
but just to be sure.

131
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,700
Signs or symbols of youth culture
are not allowed.

132
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,700
Rock music is not allowed,
nothing that looks like.

133
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,600
No magazines that are related
with youth culture.

134
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,800
Your cell phones, better known
hell if phones are strictly prohibited.

135
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,600
When I hear such a popular ring-tone,
I turn your neck.

136
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,200
There are no special boy-girl
relationships allowed.

137
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,000
No one-on-one time with someone
the female sex, ever.

138
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,300
And you wear a pair of trousers, at any time.
Except during ...

139
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
swimming, then neat swimwear
allowed.

140
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,600
The girls do not worry, be
to do the same.

141
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,500
They should wear dresses at all times.

142
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,500
And finally, leave the camp
is strictly prohibited.

143
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,300
Violation of these rules leads to
expansion of this camp.

144
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,800
Is that clear?

145
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,600
Yes, no food, no fun, no girls.
I get it.

146
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,300
I'm here to help.
And if you live according to those rules ...

147
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,600
in the time you're here, bring your
closer to the Lord Jesus.

148
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,700
Say Amen.
- Jack ...

149
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,100
To begin with I,
Check all your stuff ...

150
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,900
to ensure that we all
same thing.

151
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,100
Unity, brothers.

152
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,100
Open your bags
and keep them ready for inspection.

153
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,100
James, we start with you.
What do you have on you?

154
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,900
Just off this road.

155
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,900
What have we here?
Let's see.

156
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,200
Why do you need it?
You do not even shave.

157
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,200
It's ...

158
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,500
Wait a minute ...
What is this?

159
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,100
The Haribo factory.
That's nice.

160
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,800
This is not a good start.
- I sometimes get hungry.

161
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,200
Jesus got hungry in the desert,
for 40 days and 40 nights.

162
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,100
I'm disappointed. - Sorry.
- I am also sorry for you.

163
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,600
Tommy, what about here?

164
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,400
You read this? From yourself?
- Yes.

165
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,000
That's great. Very good, Tommy.
You would also have to read Dante.

166
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,900
Jack, how about you?

167
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,200
What is this?
- No Spawn nine. Very good.

168
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,900
Look at this.
- It's Angela. Very tasty.

169
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,700
I can not let this hold.

170
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,500
This is a sinful place.

171
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,000
I take this space.
- No, you can not make.

172
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,600
You know what else I can do?
This.

173
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,700
What are you doing?

174
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,200
Are you going to test me?

175
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,800
Pick it up and pray for God's grace.

176
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,300
Pick it up.

177
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,500
Christian, my things are here,
if you want to take a look.

178
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,100
Sit down, my brothers and sisters.

179
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,900
This is the day.

180
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,700
Which we are at war,
brothers and sisters.

181
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,600
At war with the world.

182
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,900
At war with the body.

183
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,700
And at war with the Devil,
Satan and his dominion.

184
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,300
From all indications show that
the end of the day is near.

185
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,600
And make no mistake, the Devil is real.

186
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,300
And what is worse, he knows he
lost.

187
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,000
So if a cornered,
wounded animal ...

188
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,900
will increase and possible strike
of you grabbing ...

189
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:36,300
before descending into the pit of fire,
forever.

190
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,800
The beast moves.

191
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,200
And what do we know about Satan
and his demons?

192
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,400
He rules the world with all its
much better than we know.

193
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,200
So he'll imagination against you.
And he'll like that against you.

194
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,100
He will proudly use
to trick you and your sharing.

195
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,500
And why are we so blessed,
brothers and sisters ...

196
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,900
to be here in this camp,
at this time, this moment.

197
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,500
The Kingdom of Heaven is yours,
if you seize the opportunity.

198
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:22,500
Do you think not, you are incredible
torture your destiny, for all eternity.

199
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Jesus gives us no choice.

200
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,600
So, rise up brothers and sisters.

201
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,800
Arise children of God
and take what He offers you.

202
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,100
Help me, Jesus, protect me.

203
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,400
Protect me.

204
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,800
Jesus, protect me.

205
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,600
Protect yourself ...

206
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:38,300
Lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil, Amen.

207
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:45,000
Breakfast, morning at seven o'clock, exactly.
Brothers and sisters, go in peace.

208
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,200
You okay?
- Yes.

209
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,900
Has Tommy back candy
from the liquor cabinet?

210
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,500
You said that time had been.

211
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,200
Are you okay?
- Yes, why?

212
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,600
I do not know, it looked fierce
from net. I was worried about you.

213
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,100
Yes, it was strange.

214
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,000
It's good now.
- You are fortunately not injured.

215
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,200
We need to clean chairs,
not socializing with the sisters.

216
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,400
Jimmy, it's good.
- He has an attack.

217
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,700
Jimmy, is this a joke?

218
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,600
Open his mouth.
- Somebody get Christian.

219
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,800
From what the guys tell me ...

220
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,300
it was probably a slight
clonic seizure.

221
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,000
What is that?

222
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,700
An attack, caused by sudden
light and a startle response.

223
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,000
Apparently they wanted a joke with him
prosecuting.

224
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,900
We contact with his parents to
to see if he already had ...

225
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,300
and we take him to the hospital,
Just to be sure.

226
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,400
I'm sorry Jimmy,
that I had never imagined.

227
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,500
I'm sorry. It was very stupid of me,
I just wanted to scare him.

228
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,800
You should know better, Tim.

229
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,300
Remember next time to ensure
for your brother.

230
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,700
Yes, of course.

231
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,900
Father?
- Yes, Thomas, what can I do for you?

232
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,200
I was hoping we could talk, I have ...

233
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,200
We have time, I seek you on.

234
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,600
Yes, sir. Thanks.

235
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,100
Brothers,
I have our schedule for today.

236
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,700
Immediately after the morning prayer, we divide
us into groups.

237
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,100
The distribution is done based
of you sleeping.

238
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,300
And after lunch we have recreation time.

239
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,300
The game today 'Stratego Alive'.

240
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:44,100
Thus, group A
Timothy, Jack, Thomas and Jimmy.

241
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,100
We gather as a group,
at the baseball field.

242
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,700
And because Jack thought a sarcasm
good way ...

243
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,600
the kitchen crew to thank for
breakfast this morning ...

244
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,900
do you have maid service
this evening.

245
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,000
The sin of one affects many.
- The sin of one.

246
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,400
Does anyone have anything that he wants to share?

247
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,600
What about your vows,
this summer?

248
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,100
What? Do you have enough time to make them
all to discuss?

249
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,200
I have a confession,
I've broken a vow.

250
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,100
I found a CD, a rock album.

251
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,400
I do not know why, but I
Listened to 100 times.

252
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,800
Did you still have it?
- No, I'm wasted.

253
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,700
I noticed the effect on my mind.
- Good.

254
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,400
It is good that you recognize that
rock music you can influence.

255
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,500
I mean, before I found the Lord
and came to this community ...

256
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,500
rock music is me
along dangerous roads.

257
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,200
It started with going to concerts ...

258
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:56,100
those concerts were drugs and alcohol.

259
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,300
And people who had sex,
without being married.

260
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,200
He wanted that fixed too.
- What did you say?

261
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,500
Nothing.
- I have a question for you.

262
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,900
I understand why your comic
I torn?

263
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Frankly no, but you
established a very good explanation.

264
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,100
Is it not clear to you that this comic
a part of youth culture?

265
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,400
And it contributes nothing to with
to get closer to the Lord.

266
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500
No, but even if it is ...

267
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,600
gives you no right to my
personal belongings destroyed.

268
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,200
Jack, if you give in to the temptations
of this world ...

269
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,900
makes it easier for Satan
to find a weakness, a vice ...

270
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,400
and then he crushed you.

271
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,300
Why has so much power?

272
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,500
Who gave him that power? God?
- Of course not.

273
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,700
Why does God allow Satan to exist?

274
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,800
Why does He allow us to risk?
Why, if he loves us?

275
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,900
It is because of us. Our sin.
The sin of Adam and Eve.

276
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,500
We have given power to Satan.
It is because of us.

277
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,100
My deceased grandfather last month.
- I know. I'm sorry.

278
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,500
It does not matter.
I just want to know where he is now.

279
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,300
Is he in hell?
He dies?

280
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,600
We suffer in purgatory so
we are cleansed of our sins.

281
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,200
Before he died, he told me
way to go here ...

282
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,200
away from the community,
as fast as I could.

283
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,600
He loved me.

284
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,500
Perhaps we should call
with your parents there, after this camp.

285
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,200
What he, Christian.
What do you do in this forest?

286
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,100
My name is not a Christian,
I am of the camp.

287
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,300
Yes? The Christian camp?

288
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,000
What's going on?

289
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:17,100
Take care, Christian.
And remember to whom this forest.

290
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,700
Inbreeding acorns.
- Jack, your language, please.

291
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
Tommy, let's hang the flag back.

292
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,300
Well you have one.

293
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,400
Even Judas was popular for a while.

294
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,500
I have joy in my heart.

295
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,800
Where?
- In my heart, in my heart.

296
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,700
Good work. Really.
- How you doing, guys?

297
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,800
Christian, how likely is that we
allowed to park in that city?

298
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,500
Zero point zero.

299
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,600
I like corn on the cob good.

300
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,200
It's been years since I went to
an amusement park have been.

301
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,500
You hear that, Christian?
Tommy has not been there for years.

302
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,500
The last time was with my grandfather.
- His dead grandfather, Christian.

303
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,700
It's pretty funny because he always said
tell my parents we went to mass.

304
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,600
But then we went to Coney Island.
And they still do not know.

305
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,000
Is this the same grandma that you said here
far as possible to stay away?

306
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,800
I understand now what impact
He had on your life.

307
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,900
Stop, it goes too far.
- Should it be encouraged? Shame?

308
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,700
I did not say it, it is
his grandfather, have a little compassion.

309
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,600
Why are you so
negative, Jack?

310
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,000
Maybe
I know what your father's bitter new psyche.

311
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,700
It's not just my father.
All the leaders agreed.

312
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,000
And not just here.

313
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,600
Communities around the world
adapt to the new rule.

314
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,100
That is best for the community.
-But misery for us.

315
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,300
Jack, it's ...
- Look over there.

316
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,200
The statue was moved.
The first was to the right.

317
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,700
Scary things are happening here.

318
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,600
Let's go.

319
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,800
The last wish of an important figure
is difficult to overcome.

320
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,100
We need guys like Thomas.
We can not let him go.

321
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,500
Protect your.

322
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,700
This happened when my grandmother was with us.

323
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,900
My father's mother.

324
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,700
She was dying.
She had Alzheimer's.

325
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:05,000
My father spent every night at
her rosaries and prayed.

326
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,700
She then became worse,
They spat and cursed.

327
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,000
Such things.

328
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,600
One night he took holy water
to sprinkle on her.

329
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,500
Just when he wanted to do ...

330
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,800
the phone rang.

331
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,200
He recorded and heard a
voice he did not recognize.

332
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:34,100
It was the voice of a child.
High-pitched, excited.

333
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,100
As if marbles
were in his mouth.

334
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,900
And the voice said:

335
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,800
Leave her alone!

336
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,800
My father asked who
I spoke.

337
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,300
There was only one
grudgingly sound.

338
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,400
And the voice became
even more excited.

339
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,500
She said: "We warn you.
Leave her alone. "

340
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,900
My father hung up the phone.

341
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:17,000
He blessed the room with holy water.

342
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,700
He sat down and began
a Rosary.

343
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,300
And when he did this the phone rang.

344
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:29,900
I let it ring.
It rang and rang ...

345
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,300
until I became frustrated and
threw the phone against the wall.

346
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,500
And then it was paused.

347
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,100
And he sat down.

348
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,700
And once he made the sign of a cross ...

349
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,000
the phone rang.

350
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,300
I was in my life has never been so scared.

351
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,100
It happened every night.

352
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,600
My father disconnected all phones
Before entering her room.

353
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,500
And once he made the sign of the cross ...

354
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,200
the phones were ringing.
All of them.

355
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,400
This went on until she died.

356
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,600
I have felt them earlier.

357
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,500
What?

358
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,600
Brothers, time to get up
and serve the Lord.

359
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,700
Let's do it, guys.

360
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,700
The Lord must be served.
I'm excited.

361
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,500
Come, Holy Spirit

362
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,700
Blessed Creator

363
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,200
and in our hearts ...

364
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,500
Take all of your retirement

365
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:23,600
Come with your grace
Heavenly and air ...

366
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:30,800
our hearts heal
that you have made

367
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:37,900
our hearts heal
that you have made

368
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,400
Brethren, I can not do enough
stress.

369
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:51,200
If your sexuality is not subject
the will of God ...

370
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,200
can and will be your downfall.

371
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,400
It starts with your imagination ...

372
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,700
fantasies that ultimately
lead to masturbation.

373
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,200
For you to completely dominate
resulting in sexual perversity.

374
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,600
These are serious,
reprehensible sins.

375
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,300
You're not welcome
In the Kingdom of Heaven ...

376
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,600
if you masturbate, even if only
once, without to confess.

377
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,700
Or if you intimate caresses with a sister ...

378
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,100
or a brother.

379
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,800
If you're an orgasm is the same
as sex before marriage.

380
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,100
Stay on your guard.
Stay chaste.

381
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,700
Your very souls are at stake.

382
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,500
Hi, how are you?

383
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,000
Let us thank God for
this delicious meal ...

384
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,100
prepared with love.
Give each other hand.

385
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,300
Dear God, thank You for
this meal is here.

386
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,800
Thank you for the person who
prepared for us.

387
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,200
Bless them for
selfless sacrifice they make.

388
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,300
And bless this congregation,
this community ...

389
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:22,100
Now as we celebrate your goodness.
Amen.

390
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,100
Amen.

391
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,200
Father, I ...
- You wanted to see me.

392
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,900
Yes, I wanted to talk ...

393
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,000
Come to the chapel after dinner.

394
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,000
Thomas ...

395
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,800
Come inside.

396
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,000
This is the cup of my blood.

397
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,900
This cup was a gift.

398
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,100
The thirteenth birthday
of my initiation.

399
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,100
Come on, hold it.

400
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,600
Stick with it.

401
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,000
It is the divinity.

402
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,500
In your hands hold up
the holder of the divine.

403
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,100
The blood of our Lord.

404
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,200
And the altar, God is here
manifested.

405
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,100
His flesh, His blood.

406
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,900
Through me, His priest.

407
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:47,000
It's pretty intense.
- It's a well-chosen word. Intense.

408
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,600
A good word.

409
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,300
How does it feel?

410
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,200
In order to consecrate the Eucharist?

411
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,600
It feels like when
shared a secret with you.

412
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,100
A glimpse of the sublime.

413
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,300
Something that we do not fully understand ...

414
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,600
but we know that it's bigger than us.

415
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,200
Humbled to be part
this piece of magic ...

416
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,900
this mystery.

417
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:32,700
Every day when I do my part
in the consecration of the Eucharist ...

418
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,200
is new.

419
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Like the first kiss of a couple.

420
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,500
This is the miracle of the priesthood.

421
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,200
It's a wonderful life, Thomas.

422
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,600
Have you ever thought?
- I?

423
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,100
No, I do not think
me that she would be admitted.

424
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,300
What is it, Thomas?

425
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,800
You'll think I'm crazy.
- I think not.

426
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,800
I have these dreams ...

427
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,000
actually nightmares.

428
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,000
It's like I'm being ...

429
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,600
a demon.

430
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,400
This is in your dreams, you say?

431
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:52,500
But when I wake
it's still just me.

432
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,800
It's like my
sense loss, Father.

433
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,100
I know of cases of
demonic possession.

434
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,500
It's rare but it happens,
and it can be frightening.

435
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,700
If this happens again,
you come to me immediately.

436
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,300
No matter what time it is,
you understand?

437
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,900
Yes, Father.

438
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,800
Bend your head.

439
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,800
Come on, let those two beat.

440
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,300
Do more.

441
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,500
Come, walk like you mean it.

442
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,800
And then, what then?

443
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,700
That's it, come on.

444
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,000
Here.

445
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,600
Come on.

446
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,800
Everything okay?
- Your turn.

447
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,900
It hurts.
I go to the infirmary.

448
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,900
Do you want me to go with you?
- No, I got it.

449
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,600
I go for it, Jimmy.

450
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,400
You can get a little rest.

451
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,800
Here you can be a little sleepy.

452
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,700
But the dance is tonight.

453
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:42,000
You will be there.
Rest now first.

454
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,400
Lord Jesus, bless this child.

455
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,400
Heal him, Lord.

456
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,100
Welcome to the dance.

457
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,600
Brothers and sisters, tonight will
you are so happy because ...

458
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,500
Tonight we
The folk dance.

459
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:57,100
Shortest to longest. We put David's here,
and Goliath's there.

460
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,800
Jack, put your shirt into your pants.

461
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,300
Jack, come on.

462
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,900
This will be great.

463
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,000
Where's Tommy?

464
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,900
He came to the ward.

465
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,400
Folk dance evening.
Smile.

466
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:25,700
Do you like the Folk?
I know you love.

467
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,300
Tommy ...

468
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,200
Give everything!

469
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,000
Where were you?

470
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:29,000
I had another asthma attack
and I fell asleep.

471
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,100
Is it going?
I missed you.

472
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,700
It looks like you have a good time.

473
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,500
I would do anything for me
you have fun.

474
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,600
Lets make a deal.
Tonight.

475
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,900
How?

476
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:52,800
Come to me.
Jack lets your alibi.

477
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:56,400
Are you crazy? You know what
happens when we are caught?

478
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,500
I know.
I do not care.

479
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:02,400
I want to see.
Come to me.

480
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,300
Okay, at half past eleven.
See you at the stables.

481
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,300
What are you doing here in the dark?

482
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,500
We were talking.
He was sick and ...

483
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:19,100
Just go back to your cabin.
You're acting like a tramp.

484
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,000
Excuse me?
- A whore.

485
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:27,100
You're acting like a whore here in the
pitch dark, with a young man.

486
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,800
People will think you
're a whore.

487
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,900
Good night, Melissa.

488
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,700
I am extremely disappointed
in you, Thomas.

489
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,600
I thought I would not make it.

490
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,800
A few judges were
on the balcony and blocked the road.

491
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,000
I thought the horses
would betray me.

492
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,800
Where's Tommy?

493
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,100
I think the nurse.
Have asthma, you know.

494
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,200
FYI, Jesus is your
savior, not your friend.

495
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,700
Funny. How would
the Inquisition you, Christian?

496
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,300
My father told your parents about
thought of leaving this place.

497
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,400
Is it true?

498
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,700
How do these rumors as soon as the round?

499
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,600
Oddly, this community, with all
her dedication, gossips more ...

500
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,900
than people in a supermarket.

501
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,600
So it is true?

502
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,500
Yes, I mean,
they just think about it.

503
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,900
Let's sit down.

504
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,900
But why?

505
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,300
Nobody knows this but,
My father is in the AA.

506
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,100
Really?

507
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,400
Before his conversion
He was a real alcoholic.

508
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,100
My parents were so
almost divorced.

509
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:09,100
I did not, sorry.

510
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:15,400
With this new rule they've
ordered not to go ...

511
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,200
and my mom would not.

512
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,600
But if you leave ...
- I know how it is when someone leaves.

513
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,800
How they are treated.

514
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,700
It means that my parents
lost in this world.

515
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,200
The flesh and the devil.

516
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,300
And how will their slutty daughter perish?

517
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,700
I can not believe
he called you so.

518
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,800
Neither do I.

519
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,300
Why did you say anything then?

520
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,400
By Father Phineas?
Are you crazy?

521
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,500
No, not if you believe
that he was wrong.

522
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,100
It was so wrong to me
so to speak.

523
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:09,600
I know, I had something to say.
Sorry, Mel.

524
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,100
Remember how much fun it was?
When we were kids?

525
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:29,200
There were prayer meetings, followed by
picnics that lasted and lasted.

526
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,000
We had so much fun.
It was fantastic.

527
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,100
I met you for the first time
in such a picnic.

528
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,000
You were eight or nine years.
Something?

529
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,900
Yes, I think eight.

530
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,500
You were so cute.

531
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,200
You always had such an effect on me.

532
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,700
Oh God, Mel.

533
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,900
Oh God, Mel.

534
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,400
Tommy ...
Stay with me.

535
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,200
Stay with me.

536
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,500
Father miserable ...

537
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,500
You failed.
As you've always failed.

538
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,900
Time's up.

539
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,100
God is with me.

540
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,800
I can not believe this
happened.

541
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,700
Neither do I.
Are you ...

542
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,700
What?

543
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,000
Sticky.

544
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,500
We have this summer
barely touched each other.

545
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,300
It was intense.

546
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,000
Did you hear that?
- Yes.

547
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,700
We can not
caught in this way.

548
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,800
Stay here, stay.

549
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,300
I can not believe we just did.

550
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,300
Say this to anyone.

551
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,400
Tommy, I have no regrets.

552
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,400
Please, do not
it feels bad.

553
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,200
I give a lot to you.

554
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,500
I will not tell anyone.

555
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,200
I can not even imagine
I would say to them.

556
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,100
I'll wait here a few minutes
and then I follow you.

557
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:35,500
I do not want them coming home to see us together.

558
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,200
That is a bad girl.

559
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:55,600
That is a bad girl.

560
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:01,500
That is a bad girl.

561
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,700
Why are not you
with your campers?

562
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:29,900
Because someone is missing.
Who?

563
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,300
Thomas Leary.
- Come on.

564
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,500
This is the path.

565
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,400
This is the path.

566
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,200
Sister, what happens?

567
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,300
I get nothing but tatters.

568
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,700
They have the same nightmare.
- Father, what happened?

569
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:11,700
Sisters, keep the peace.
Be calm, nothing will happen.

570
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,800
Father, protect these Sisters.

571
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,800
Take all the bad thoughts away.

572
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,300
All fear of the enemy.

573
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,500
Melissa, why are you
still dressed?

574
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,300
Tommy?

575
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,200
Tommy?

576
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,100
Tommy, stop.
- Stay here.

577
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,000
My God.

578
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,500
Okay?

579
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,400
The inhaler.
- Where is he?

580
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:13,700
In the infirmary.
- I'll get him.

581
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,300
Carol, is he okay?

582
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,900
He is better. He was afraid.
Asthma can be very frightening.

583
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,500
Yes, it is.
I must see him.

584
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,700
Sure, but he is very weak
and can not speak.

585
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:05,000
The drugs must do their job.
Can not this wait until tomorrow?

586
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,100
I do not see why not.

587
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,600
Thanks for your help tonight.
God bless you.

588
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,900
I will stay here with him
and go pray for him.

589
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:14,700
Then I'm gone.
Good night.

590
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,500
Good night, Father.

591
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,300
Do not speak, Thomas.

592
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
If you're better tomorrow
we should talk.

593
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:41,500
I know you're not responsible
are for the desecration of the chapel ...

594
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,300
but there are certain
things happened tonight.

595
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,900
You know what I speak.

596
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,300
You will tell me.

597
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,200
Got it?

598
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:50,200
This is my body
that you will be sacrificed.

599
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:22,400
He took the cup, saying 'Thank You'.

600
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,100
He handed the cup to his disciples
and said ...

601
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:30,100
This is the cup of my blood.

602
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:34,200
The blood of the New and
everlasting covenant.

603
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:37,600
Do this in memory of me.

604
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:59,300
This is Melissa. I received it via
one of the girls from her cabin.

605
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:03,700
Gotta go, the mass begins.
Are you okay? What happened?

606
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:10,800
Everything is fine.
I'm going to shower.

607
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:14,200
We'll talk later on.

608
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,300
Yes, I'll tell it later.

609
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:19,400
Can I read?
- No.

610
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,700
Goodbye.

611
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:32,000
Tommy, if you're ready ...

612
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:35,900
and if you can, come back to me.

613
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:52,100
What were you doing outside your cabin tonight?
- I was sick, I had asthma.

614
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:57,700
I know but there was a girl
not in her cabin last night.

615
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,600
Were you with her?

616
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:06,200
Who?
- Do not play games with me.

617
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,700
I do not know what you have it, Father.

618
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,800
All right.

619
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,800
What were you doing in the chapel tonight?

620
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:29,500
I saw it, Father.
- What did you see?

621
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,600
The demon.

622
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:35,900
When did you first felt?

623
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,400
I do not know, it started
after my grandfather died.

624
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,800
Is this the grandfather you
brought to amusement parks ...

625
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,500
instead of going to church?

626
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:53,800
Yes.

627
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:59,200
Were you good friends?
- Very good friends.

628
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:03,100
My condolences at the loss.

629
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:30,000
Am I crazy, Father?

630
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,500
I've seen this before.

631
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:35,600
And what happened to him?
Where is he?

632
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,200
He stays in a mental institution.

633
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:41,500
He tried to commit suicide
and his sister to murder.

634
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,600
Why would God allow this?

635
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:51,800
God can not be questioned
our weak minds.

636
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:56,200
And this is God's will?

637
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:59,900
Nothing on this earth is done without
God's permission.

638
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,300
He tests us
within our own borders.

639
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,400
He gives us the resources, sacraments
and the grace to fight enemies.

640
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:12,500
Because the enemy is cruel.

641
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,800
But you choose whether you accept
what he offers.

642
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:22,100
I can help, but then
You listen and do what I say.

643
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,200
I do what is necessary.

644
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,900
Here, sit down.
- Yes.

645
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,800
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

646
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,200
Forgive me Father,
for I have sinned.

647
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,900
When was the last confession?

648
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:54,600
A few months back.
- Go on.

649
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:59,000
After my last confession, I lied.

650
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,800
I've lied to my parents.
- And the sins of the flesh?

651
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,000
Yes, Father.

652
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,600
I have impure thoughts.
- You masturbate?

653
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,000
Yes, Father.
- How often?

654
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,200
So every day.
I do not know.

655
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:29,100
You invite the Devil in your imagination.
Every time you masturbate you open a door.

656
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:34,100
Do you understand?
- Yes.

657
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,600
And Melissa?

658
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:40,600
Were you with her?

659
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,500
You can not honestly confess if you
suppresses a sin that you know ...

660
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,800
thus reach forgiveness.

661
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:58,200
So, were you with her?

662
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,600
Yes.
- This is a serious offense.

663
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:10,200
Got her a sin?

664
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:19,400
A kiss, that's all.
She is a good person.

665
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:23,800
Are you sure, others not?
Sin remains if you do not confess.

666
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,800
I know.

667
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:39,900
Good. If you take more punishment
not participate in the camp.

668
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,800
The remaining time you spend here
to pray and serve ...

669
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:47,800
and I have to tell your parents
what you did.

670
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,600
But as you said in this
a confession ...

671
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,500
I must ask your permission.

672
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:59,400
Can I tell them?
- Rather not.

673
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:03,500
Thomas, none of this will
easy, nothing.

674
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:13,000
You're disgusting.

675
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,500
Do you have any idea about the shame
You've caused me ...

676
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:20,100
in my name, your mother? Well?

677
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,400
I'm sorry.
- That means nothing. Just empty words.

678
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,300
You sorry means nothing,
these are empty words.

679
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,400
Empty words.
Listen now to the Father.

680
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:31,900
You must change, otherwise ...
Stand up for God.

681
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:36,100
Your mother wants to talk to you.

682
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,600
I'm here.
- What did you do?

683
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:48,100
Mom?
- Yes?

684
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,500
Mom, please ...

685
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,800
Tommy ...
- Enough.

686
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Try not to get sympathy.
That you will not find here.

687
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,000
None.
You did this.

688
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,700
Listen to the Father.

689
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,300
Be a man or you will not come home.

690
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
No Hope For You

691
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:28,300
I'm so sorry.

692
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,900
I've got my glove needed.
- What is happening, friend?

693
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:48,900
Nothing.

694
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:55,300
Maybe I'll sneak into the park
During the stage tonight.

695
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:59,400
I love the cream waffles
and they have a crazy rollercoaster.

696
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,600
Go you, "Padawan?
- I'm grounded.

697
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,700
Really? What?

698
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:09,800
I am caught.
- By Melissa?

699
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,400
Was Father Falic evil?

700
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,100
Yes, you could say.
- Damn.

701
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:20,200
It's not fair.
- What?

702
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:25,500
Only if it is against the rules.
- Calm down.

703
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,500
Are you okay?

704
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:33,100
Pray for me, Jack.

705
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,500
Can I help you, officer?

706
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,000
Is this one of your campers?
- Yes, what happened?

707
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:15,600
He came into contact with a pair of
our local young people at the park.

708
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:17,300
A few elements of our poorer.

709
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,900
They've beaten him properly of
what I understand.

710
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:24,400
He was lucky.
A good Samaritan intervened.

711
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:27,500
He caught some of those guys,
and she quite frightened.

712
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,200
One of them known vandalism.

713
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,500
Agents are looking for the stolen
stuff.

714
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:35,400
That's good news.

715
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:41,100
We made our concerns. One child
his age, outside unattended.

716
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,900
We called his parents and
who told him to bring back here.

717
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:50,700
Thank you so much.
Help me with the latter.

718
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,300
I'll let you go for tonight.
It'll be fine.

719
01:12:55,800 --> 01:13:00,300
She put me and marked me with this clip.
- What happened?

720
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,000
Inbreeding which figures you encountered
in the forest.

721
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,100
Who jumped me in the park
and beat me up.

722
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,500
Now you know why we have rules
that we use.

723
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,500
Those idiots had earlier problems
experienced one of the brothers ...

724
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:13,100
In a restaurant one year ago.

725
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,500
They wait for us until we came back ...

726
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:16,700
because their parents said they
would go to hell.

727
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:19,700
There will be nothing much to do here.
- You should be happy ...

728
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,300
the fact that you could sacrifice yourself
for your brothers and sisters.

729
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,800
Are you kidding?
I do not care about them.

730
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:28,400
How can you say that?
After all we have done for you.

731
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,700
What have you done for me?

732
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,100
You turned my back on family and made
my father a sort of medicine?

733
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:38,400
For years, demanded the leaders of these
community, his father, my father ...

734
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,800
That's not fair.
- Fewer people outside the community helped.

735
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,700
So he had more time for
the brothers and sisters.

736
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:46,000
But when you decided to go brainwash.

737
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,100
What are we now?
What should my family now?

738
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,000
Jack, you're going too far.
- Shut up, Christian!

739
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,900
Should I listen to you?
Are you my example?

740
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,600
A 23-year-old follower who does everything
what he said.

741
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,600
You have no fucking idea
of yourself.

742
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:00,500
Look at yourself, look at your nails.
Come on, show them.

743
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:03,700
You bite it like a little girl.
You allow yourself as influenced by their use ...

744
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:06,700
Chris, stop it.

745
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:10,900
Jack, stop.

746
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,900
What are you doing?
Okay?

747
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,700
Get out of here.

748
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:31,100
Go away.

749
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:34,400
You belong here.
- Since you're absolutely right.

750
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:13,700
What time is it?
- No idea, about two hours.

751
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:16,800
I'm outta here.

752
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,600
What? How?

753
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,600
My father is here, my parents ...

754
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,200
I think we are tired of this camp.

755
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,500
Really?

756
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:32,300
Shut up there.
You come through here.

757
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:36,600
Is it right?
- Yeah, right.

758
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:41,200
They can beat me down but I come
just back stronger than before.

759
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:49,000
Take care of yourself.

760
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:51,700
See you on the other side.

761
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,500
Yes.

762
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:13,300
The world is us, use our pride,
our greed ...

763
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:18,100
secular humanism is his church.

764
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:20,900
And the flesh is weak for us ...

765
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,600
lustful temptations.

766
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:29,100
But the Devil uses both
our brains to attack.

767
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:34,600
The devil knows our psyche,
and how it works, better than we do.

768
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:39,200
He uses the weakness of our brains,
for us to drive to anger ...

769
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,500
to fear, to despair.

770
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:48,000
John of the Cross ...

771
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:51,300
was often oppressed by the Devil.

772
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:56,500
And in his dark night, he discusses
the tortures of the devil.

773
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:58,100
This is what he says ...

774
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:02,900
If the spiritual communication is not
fully provided to the mind ...

775
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,000
but also on the senses ...

776
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:09,400
then the easier the Devil mind
disrupt and irritate ...

777
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,000
Terrors by the senses.

778
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:16,700
The pain and anguish it causes
are enormous.

779
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,500
And sometimes impossible.

780
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:23,000
Since direct transfer takes place
between mind and spirit ...

781
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:28,000
The evil spirit causes a horror
in the right spirit ...

782
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:33,100
sometimes for the good spirit
intolerable.

783
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:37,200
Holy Mary, Mother of God pray
for us sinners ...

784
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:39,700
now and in the hour of death.
Amen.

785
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,200
Father?

786
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,000
Thomas ...

787
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:38,500
I came here looking for you.

788
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,900
Are you free from sin?

789
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:43,400
Yes, Father.

790
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:45,900
No more masturbated?

791
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:47,600
No.

792
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:52,500
Wonderful, you are a sincere
and faithful servant.

793
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:57,400
I'm proud of what you have achieved.

794
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,000
Thank you, sir.

795
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,800
Go back to the prayer,
See you later.

796
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:09,700
Hail Mary, full of grace,
The Lord is with You ..

797
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:12,600
You are blessed among women.
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

798
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,900
Hail Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners ...

799
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:16,200
now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

800
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,300
Hail Mary, full of grace,
The Lord is with You ..

801
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:19,800
blessed is the fruit of thy womb ...

802
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:22,600
I'll get it.
- Wait for me, Rose.

803
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,500
And Dr. Jack. John there.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

804
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,700
Hi, John.
- Patricia.

805
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:31,700
Jack, what happened to your face?

806
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,900
Why are not you at camp?

807
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,900
My son has something
that you need to hear.

808
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:41,000
When Tommy first told that
I thought he was crazy.

809
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,200
I do not always agree with
community ...

810
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,200
but I still believe in God
and the Devil.

811
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,300
What do you mean, Jack?

812
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:52,500
Jack, wait for me in the car,
Please.

813
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:57,500
Tommy is my best friend and
I'm really worried about him.

814
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,400
You must first listen to me, Michael.
I've seen this before.

815
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,700
Phineas is a good father and husband
done a lot for the community, but ...

816
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,600
I fear that he is here to participate
faces.

817
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:23,200
I know you have problems with
the leaders at this point ...

818
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,300
Michael ...
- But it suggests ...

819
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,600
Please let him speak.

820
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,800
There was a boy, Daniel,
an altar boy for Father Phineas.

821
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,600
He looked a lot like Tommy.

822
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:37,000
But the boy had problems,
serious problems.

823
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:39,300
Phineas father sent him to me ...

824
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:44,300
because the boy claimed he
chased by a devil.

825
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:48,900
Our brains can be amazing
things.

826
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:52,100
But what I saw was this guy ...

827
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,700
it was something I never want to see.

828
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:00,900
Then I knew that the torment of Daniel ...

829
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:04,600
far more psychological than anything,
it had to be spiritual.

830
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:09,900
So when working with Father Phineas
the spiritual part and I helped him greatly.

831
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:14,200
The way he took care of Daniel,
how he focused on debt ...

832
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:17,600
sin, but only gave the demon
more power.

833
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,900
More control.
- What happened to the boy, Daniel?

834
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:26,200
Your Tommy is a good boy
and he has both of you.

835
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,800
What happened to Daniel ...
- Just tell us.

836
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:35,600
One night, he shut himself
and his little sister ...

837
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:40,000
that was not older than Rose,
in the bathroom of their home.

838
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:44,800
He cut her wrists and then ...

839
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,500
their own.

840
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:51,900
And only by some miracle,
They were found on time.

841
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:54,900
That never forgive myself.

842
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:58,700
And the church?

843
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,400
The church could do nothing?
No ghost exorcism?

844
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,600
She did not.

845
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,800
Daniel was suppressed.
He was not possessed.

846
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:12,800
The church has very specific definitions
for possession.

847
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,700
Certain criteria for Eviction
to take place.

848
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:18,700
Daniel did not meet these criteria ...

849
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:23,200
So he was left to the care
Father of Phineas and me.

850
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:28,000
And we failed.

851
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:31,300
What does this have to do with my son,
John?

852
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:37,500
I fear that the same demon success
wishes to obtain, such as Daniel ...

853
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,500
the same strategy to
for Tommy.

854
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:44,600
Father Phineas and he
found an unwitting accomplice.

855
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,200
Open the door.
Rose.

856
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,500
Rose.

857
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,200
Honey.

858
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,700
What is it, honey?

859
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:14,600
It is good ...

860
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:17,400
It's OK ...

861
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,700
Brethren, I know that the last day,
in this camp have been difficult.

862
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,700
It is now clear that the Evil
his work is doing in our lives.

863
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:33,800
Tonight we will fight against him.

864
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:37,300
Tonight we will expel him.

865
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,800
Let us pray for one another.

866
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,700
Choose a brother and ask him
to pray for you.

867
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:49,000
Lord, banish Satan
the name of Jesus.

868
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:52,300
Dispel Satan in the name of Jesus.

869
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:56,500
Pray for me, Tommy.

870
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,000
Pray that I will be strong ...

871
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:01,200
let me holy.

872
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:08,500
We drive out Satan in the name of Jesus.

873
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,200
We drive out Satan in the name of Jesus.

874
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,300
We drive out Satan in the name of Jesus.

875
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:17,000
No, stop.

876
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:19,700
Tim, what is it?
- Make it stop. No, stop.

877
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,600
Timothy, what is it?
- God, what is that smell?

878
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,200
I saw the Devil, a demon ...
I do not know what I saw.

879
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:32,800
It was so real.

880
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
A prediction of the Lord.

881
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,300
Fear not my children,
for I am with you.

882
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,500
I make sure nothing happens to you.

883
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,400
I love you.

884
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,400
But evil has no ...

885
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,700
What happens?

886
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:59,400
Stop.
- I hate ...

887
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:02,900
you.

888
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:11,800
What was that?

889
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:21,300
What happened?

890
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:25,200
What happened?
- I do not know ...

891
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,700
Go to my room.

892
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:34,400
Now.

893
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:39,100
Calm down. I'll protect you.

894
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:51,000
Why did you not tell me?

895
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:53,700
Father, I lied.

896
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,200
You gave us all at risk.

897
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:59,400
You go with your sin,
without taking account of the Devil.

898
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:03,900
But he keeps in mind.
He does.

899
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,200
I wanted to hurt anyone.

900
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:09,900
I blame myself.
- Confession.

901
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,900
What happened to you
and Melissa in the woods?

902
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:18,100
You did not tell me the truth.
What happened?

903
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:20,600
Have you had sex with her?
- No, Father.

904
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,500
Tell me.

905
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:29,000
We gave each other an orgasm
with our clothes on. That's all.

906
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,300
That's it?

907
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:35,600
You accept a sin in your life.

908
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:41,600
You ...

909
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:44,400
devils spawn.

910
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,600
James teeth are broken.

911
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,800
Timothy is in his own feces.

912
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:53,800
Daniel is in a lunatic asylum.

913
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,200
And all those roads lead back to you.

914
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,200
Tell me now, when ...

915
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,100
If you had to sin
in your life?

916
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:06,400
Was it your grandfather?
- No.

917
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,000
He put the door?
- No, he was a good man.

918
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:13,000
He gave you to the devil.
- He loved me.

919
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:15,000
I love you.

920
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:36,700
Tommy, stop.
Calm down.

921
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:38,300
Where is Father?

922
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:39,900
Where ...

923
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:18,300
It must be so.

924
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:33,200
You promised to protect me.

925
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:38,200
Protect me.

926
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:12,800
Be my servant.

927
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:17,400
Tommy ...

928
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:21,400
Help me.

929
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:26,400
A sinner.

930
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:29,100
I do not want.

931
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,600
Enough.

932
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,300
Can you hear me?

933
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,000
Tommy?

934
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,900
You hear me, Tommy?

935
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,500
There you are.

936
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,100
Where?

937
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,300
Do not talk.

938
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:19,900
You're in the hospital.

939
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,900
You had a severe asthma attack ...

940
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:27,100
We were almost lost.

941
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:34,500
Where is Father Phineas?
- He is also here.

942
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,800
He had a stroke, he ...

943
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:42,100
How are you?

944
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,300
You got me scared.

945
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:49,700
You look good.

946
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:53,000
Father is here, I found it on
in the hall, he makes his rounds.

947
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,500
Would you thank him the blessing?
- Of course.

948
01:30:57,900 --> 01:30:59,300
The body of Christ.

949
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,500
Tommy?

950
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:09,800
Tommy, get it, son.
- No.

951
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,800
Maybe I should ...
- No, Father.

952
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:17,000
Please.

953
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:20,800
Your son has been through a lot tonight.

954
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:27,100
Maybe it's better him alone
order.

955
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:30,000
It's okay.

956
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:34,900
I want to anymore, Mom.

957
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:40,700
If it is really the body of Christ ...

958
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:44,700
it is too much to suggest.

959
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,600
And if not,
it's all a big lie.

960
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,400
I can not believe Mom.

961
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,900
I can not and will not.

962
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:06,300
I can go to your school,
and I can follow your rules, but ...

963
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:10,400
You can not make me believe.

964
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:16,500
It's too terrible.

965
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,800
I need them redeemed.

966
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:24,900
My God ...

967
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:29,700
Enough.

968
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:32,600
Sweetheart ...

969
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:39,200
Enough.

970
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:07,600
We can not pull the plug.
God can heal him.

971
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:13,300
See you soon.

972
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:53,700
Based on a true story.

973
01:34:55,100 --> 01:35:13,800
