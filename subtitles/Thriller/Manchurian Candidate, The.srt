1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,985
Someone from
Senator Eleanor Shaw's office called

2
00:00:04,192 --> 00:00:06,353
and intervened on your behalf.

3
00:00:06,561 --> 00:00:09,121
Major, you've reached the terminal end
of the Army's patience.

4
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:11,959
You're relieved of duty,
effective immediately.

5
00:00:14,236 --> 00:00:15,965
Yes, sir.

6
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:17,502
Ben,

7
00:00:17,706 --> 00:00:20,937
there is a young neurologist
at Walter Reed. His name is Zahn.

8
00:00:21,142 --> 00:00:23,406
He's had real success
with Gulf War Syndrome.

9
00:00:23,612 --> 00:00:25,546
You are instructed to get
your affairs in order

10
00:00:25,747 --> 00:00:27,806
and report to him
first thing Monday morning.

11
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:55,772
I thought you said you lost it.

12
00:00:55,977 --> 00:00:57,535
I bit a guy. I found another one.

13
00:01:00,315 --> 00:01:03,182
These are not supposed to exist.

14
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:12,883
These are only theoretical.

15
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:19,523
So, what does it do?

16
00:01:19,734 --> 00:01:22,066
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

17
00:01:24,172 --> 00:01:25,935
I don't know.

18
00:01:28,276 --> 00:01:31,302
I don't wanna know.
You don't wanna know.

19
00:01:31,513 --> 00:01:34,243
Look, it's out of you
and you are still alive.

20
00:01:34,449 --> 00:01:36,576
That's the good news.

21
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:38,609
What's the bad news?

22
00:01:40,956 --> 00:01:43,049
Maybe they know you're here.

23
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:05,004
You said the Army implants,
they were for

24
00:02:05,213 --> 00:02:07,613
emergency medical data, right?

25
00:02:07,816 --> 00:02:10,512
The ones they publicized were.

26
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:16,519
There was a parallel project
for all kinds of scary implantables.

27
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:20,252
The Clinton watchdogs finally
freaked out about it, closed down.

28
00:02:20,462 --> 00:02:22,555
Parallel project?

29
00:02:22,764 --> 00:02:23,992
How did you know about that?

30
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:29,000
Manchurian Global funded me
to make some of their scary shit.

31
00:02:29,204 --> 00:02:30,933
Heard of them?

32
00:02:31,806 --> 00:02:34,001
Lmagine not just
a corporation, Marco,

33
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:37,838
but a goddamn geopolitical
extension of policy

34
00:02:38,046 --> 00:02:40,276
for every president since Nixon.

35
00:02:40,482 --> 00:02:42,211
Cash is king, Marco.

36
00:02:42,417 --> 00:02:44,476
Cash is king.

37
00:02:55,964 --> 00:02:58,091
You sure you wanna do this?

38
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:00,028
Absolutely.

39
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,999
Because I don't.

40
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:05,536
I'll owe you one.

41
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,469
No.

42
00:03:07,676 --> 00:03:09,473
I still owe you.

43
00:03:10,578 --> 00:03:12,876
For getting me out of Albania.

44
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:14,378
Albania.

45
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:21,055
What are you doing?

46
00:03:21,256 --> 00:03:23,019
In case I forget things
I wanna remember.

47
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:33,089
I'm putting you on a cocktail
of methohexitol to take the edge off.

48
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:34,768
The edge off of what?

49
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:38,700
Getting clarity.
Or whatever you wanna call it.

50
00:03:39,441 --> 00:03:43,707
ECT not being
the precise science that, say,

51
00:03:43,912 --> 00:03:45,880
leeching is.

52
00:03:46,081 --> 00:03:48,379
You don't think
this is gonna work?

53
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,780
It's a desperation move, man.

54
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,718
But, hey, there is a school
of thought that says

55
00:03:54,923 --> 00:03:57,255
a victim of induced abreaction...

56
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:59,427
Here it comes.

57
00:04:30,992 --> 00:04:32,983
The night is clear.
Stars, but no moon.

58
00:04:33,194 --> 00:04:34,388
The patrol is ambushed.

59
00:04:34,596 --> 00:04:38,032
We were on a routine recon
inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,

60
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:40,167
assessing troop strength...

61
00:04:40,368 --> 00:04:42,233
Captain Marco was
knocked unconscious.

62
00:04:42,437 --> 00:04:45,372
In the ensuing firefight, Eddie Ingram
gets himself separated to the left.

63
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:46,767
Baker goes after him.

64
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,169
Hello, captain.

65
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,474
Before Sergeant Shaw
is able to locate...

66
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:53,806
Eddie Ingram gets himself
separated to the left.

67
00:05:33,721 --> 00:05:35,916
Did you go blank on me again?

68
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:43,688
He said this would happen.

69
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:46,691
Who?

70
00:05:47,402 --> 00:05:50,166
Your German friend.
Your friend.

71
00:05:51,706 --> 00:05:53,196
Ben.

72
00:05:55,743 --> 00:05:59,543
He said it'd be like
a computer system crash.

73
00:05:59,747 --> 00:06:02,739
That your brain would shut down,
but it would reboot again

74
00:06:02,951 --> 00:06:05,181
and you'd forget all your RAM.

75
00:06:05,386 --> 00:06:07,377
Or most of your RAM.

76
00:06:13,728 --> 00:06:16,356
Do you remember me?

77
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,261
Do you remember me?

78
00:06:23,338 --> 00:06:24,999
Ben?

79
00:06:26,641 --> 00:06:28,609
Eugenie.

80
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:35,213
How did I get here?

81
00:06:36,017 --> 00:06:37,678
You called me.

82
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,144
Where am I?

83
00:06:40,355 --> 00:06:41,982
- Planning a suicide bombing.

84
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,182
The Mile High City has suffered
a series of brutal attacks

85
00:06:45,393 --> 00:06:46,860
during the past several months.

86
00:06:47,161 --> 00:06:51,222
Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw,
does it bother you at all

87
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:55,425
that your son repudiates
so many of your more

88
00:06:55,637 --> 00:06:58,367
- controversial policies?
- No. He's his own person.

89
00:06:58,573 --> 00:07:01,041
Raymond and I may disagree
on certain issues,

90
00:07:01,242 --> 00:07:04,405
but I think we share
the same fundamental vision

91
00:07:04,612 --> 00:07:06,045
of what this country can be.

92
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:08,010
- Which is?
- Better.

93
00:07:08,216 --> 00:07:09,774
Better and better.

94
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:12,111
Safer, braver, stronger.

95
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,414
A beacon of freedom
in a world troubled by shadows.

96
00:07:15,623 --> 00:07:17,488
America must prevail.

97
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:21,093
The future and survival
of modern civilization,

98
00:07:21,296 --> 00:07:23,958
democracy, freedom,
all depend upon it.

99
00:07:24,165 --> 00:07:26,224
So your son, Congressman Shaw...

100
00:07:26,935 --> 00:07:28,800
Rosie.

101
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,506
I was in the park on Friday?

102
00:07:39,347 --> 00:07:41,508
We were in the park on Monday.

103
00:07:43,051 --> 00:07:44,348
Monday?

104
00:07:45,086 --> 00:07:46,951
- Yep.
- Monday.

105
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,655
We were flying low.
It's, like, over the ocean, and just...

106
00:07:54,796 --> 00:07:56,286
A field hospital.

107
00:07:56,497 --> 00:07:59,762
And they took us up to this place.

108
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:02,334
- Where? Military?
- I don't know. I don't know.

109
00:08:02,537 --> 00:08:04,095
Just state-of-the-art stuff everywhere.

110
00:08:04,305 --> 00:08:08,639
Stainless steel and wires
and tubes and monitors.

111
00:08:14,482 --> 00:08:16,746
- Were you tortured?
- No. Yeah.

112
00:08:16,951 --> 00:08:20,045
I mean, there was pain.
You know, it was like...

113
00:08:22,156 --> 00:08:24,954
I don't know what they call it.

114
00:08:25,927 --> 00:08:27,588
Invasive procedure.

115
00:08:27,795 --> 00:08:29,285
For example?

116
00:08:29,497 --> 00:08:31,829
Like what? What do you mean?

117
00:08:46,147 --> 00:08:48,081
Invasive.

118
00:08:48,282 --> 00:08:50,409
See, they were in my head...

119
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:53,345
...and they made me...

120
00:08:56,124 --> 00:08:59,025
Well, Raymond Shaw,
they made him kill somebody.

121
00:08:59,227 --> 00:09:00,694
Like it was nothing.

122
00:09:00,895 --> 00:09:03,329
Private Robert Baker.

123
00:09:03,531 --> 00:09:04,930
That's who it was, it was a private.

124
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:07,567
One of my soldiers.

125
00:09:08,636 --> 00:09:11,036
I think they made me
kill somebody too.

126
00:09:13,107 --> 00:09:15,132
A kid named Eddie Ingram.

127
00:09:15,343 --> 00:09:18,107
Private Ingram, stand up.

128
00:09:18,312 --> 00:09:21,440
Walk a few steps, please.

129
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,283
And if you could secure the door,
please, Chris.

130
00:09:27,288 --> 00:09:28,812
Captain Marco.

131
00:09:29,023 --> 00:09:30,752
Stand up.

132
00:09:32,293 --> 00:09:33,760
- Raymond.
- Yes, sir.

133
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:36,191
There's a gun on the cupboard.

134
00:09:36,397 --> 00:09:39,560
Would you please take it
and give it to Captain Marco.

135
00:09:39,767 --> 00:09:41,257
Yes, sir.

136
00:09:41,469 --> 00:09:42,800
Here.

137
00:09:44,672 --> 00:09:45,639
Captain.

138
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,071
Captain Marco,

139
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,043
please shoot Private Ingram.

140
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,127
Now, Raymond,

141
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:09,694
suffocate Private Baker.

142
00:10:09,897 --> 00:10:10,921
Kill him.

143
00:10:27,915 --> 00:10:29,746
Keep going, Raymond.

144
00:10:47,602 --> 00:10:50,469
I knew the...
A soldier knows the enemy.

145
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:52,332
I'm in command.

146
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,974
That's primary, I know.

147
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,441
I thought I knew...

148
00:10:59,413 --> 00:11:00,380
...who the enemy was.

149
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:04,779
My men, they trusted me
with their lives, you know?

150
00:11:04,986 --> 00:11:06,544
Don't.

151
00:11:06,754 --> 00:11:08,312
Don't touch me.

152
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:15,693
Ben, the person that did this,
what was his name?

153
00:11:15,897 --> 00:11:17,831
Can you remember?

154
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:21,326
Did he have a name?

155
00:11:25,573 --> 00:11:27,302
Ben?

156
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,817
Smile if you like.

157
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,349
This will just take a minute.

158
00:14:41,202 --> 00:14:42,601
I see you there all the time.

159
00:14:42,803 --> 00:14:45,067
Bennett Marco.
Checks from First National Bank.

160
00:14:45,272 --> 00:14:48,867
Romance novels, instant noodles,
NoDoz and tomatoes.

161
00:14:50,177 --> 00:14:52,873
Old friend up there,
an old Army friend that...

162
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,810
Well, he's in politics now...

163
00:14:58,519 --> 00:14:59,986
What else did we talk about?

164
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:02,348
What happened to you
after you were captured?

165
00:15:03,224 --> 00:15:04,714
Black helicopters,
secret laboratories...

166
00:15:08,062 --> 00:15:10,553
...mad scientist, mind drugs...

167
00:15:11,165 --> 00:15:13,929
...shock torture
and Raymond Shaw.

168
00:15:14,135 --> 00:15:16,194
- You don't believe any of it, do you?
- It's crazy.

169
00:15:16,404 --> 00:15:18,201
- It sounds crazy, doesn't it?
- It sounds crazy.

170
00:15:18,406 --> 00:15:20,374
That's what they wanted
me to think too.

171
00:15:20,574 --> 00:15:22,439
It's exactly what they want
you to think.

172
00:15:25,613 --> 00:15:27,240
What about the other guys
from your unit?

173
00:15:28,382 --> 00:15:29,644
Where are they?

174
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,082
They're all gone.
So-called natural causes.

175
00:15:34,288 --> 00:15:36,984
Owens died of cancer in '97.

176
00:15:37,725 --> 00:15:40,717
Villalobos' car crashed.

177
00:15:40,928 --> 00:15:42,361
Atkins committed suicide.

178
00:15:42,563 --> 00:15:45,589
Jameson died 9/11, Pentagon.

179
00:15:47,902 --> 00:15:49,335
- Ben?
- Yeah?

180
00:15:49,537 --> 00:15:51,664
- Did he have a name?
- Who?

181
00:15:51,872 --> 00:15:54,500
The person that did this, Ben.

182
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,541
What was his name?
Can you remember?

183
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,442
Ben.

184
00:16:00,648 --> 00:16:02,445
- Yeah?
- Did he have a name?

185
00:17:04,712 --> 00:17:07,306
You only have to look
at the enormous strides made

186
00:17:07,515 --> 00:17:09,676
in the last decade
with the genetic reconfiguration

187
00:17:09,884 --> 00:17:11,977
of the noble tomato.

188
00:17:12,186 --> 00:17:14,984
What was happening was the tomato
was over-ripening in the process

189
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:16,986
and it was losing its flavor.

190
00:17:17,191 --> 00:17:20,752
It's actually a very simple procedure
to deactivate the gene concerned.

191
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:24,328
And the same thing
can be applied to ourselves.

192
00:17:24,532 --> 00:17:25,556
At a flick of a switch,

193
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:28,633
we can adjust character,

194
00:17:28,836 --> 00:17:30,531
change personality.

195
00:17:30,738 --> 00:17:33,263
And of course, more importantly...

196
00:17:34,141 --> 00:17:37,235
...we can offset
the ravages of dementia

197
00:17:37,444 --> 00:17:42,404
by implanting memory or adjusting
the synaptic connections.

198
00:17:42,616 --> 00:17:46,052
We can free people
from the terrible burden

199
00:17:46,253 --> 00:17:48,585
of an emotionally
compromised past.

200
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,259
- Watch where you're going!
- Sorry.

201
00:17:54,461 --> 00:17:55,553
Watch where you're going!

202
00:17:55,763 --> 00:17:57,697
Just back up! Just back up.

203
00:17:57,898 --> 00:18:01,129
Watch it. Watch it. Shut up.

204
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,767
Take it easy, sir.

205
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,538
I called the Pentagon and they told me
he's on medical leave.

206
00:18:12,746 --> 00:18:16,648
Secret Service, they got him on a
couple of their watch and observe lists.

207
00:18:18,552 --> 00:18:20,247
I guess there's been some trouble
with this guy

208
00:18:20,454 --> 00:18:22,251
involving Congressman Shaw.

209
00:18:23,457 --> 00:18:24,822
Oh?

210
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:31,356
Among the shareholders
in Manchurian Global,

211
00:18:31,565 --> 00:18:33,692
were they to ever publish a list,
which they won't,

212
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:37,234
you would find former presidents,
deposed kings,

213
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:39,929
trust fund terrorists,
fallen Communist dictators,

214
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,735
ayatollahs, African warlords
and retired prime ministers.

215
00:18:43,944 --> 00:18:46,037
- See what I mean?
- I get it. They're big. They're huge.

216
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:47,679
They're... They're...
They're gigantic.

217
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:49,746
I can't touch them. I get it.
I don't want to.

218
00:18:50,584 --> 00:18:52,051
And you bring me rumors
and conjecture.

219
00:18:52,252 --> 00:18:54,152
I started with nightmares.
Rumors, conjectures,

220
00:18:54,355 --> 00:18:55,845
that's a giant leap forward.

221
00:18:56,323 --> 00:18:59,349
Nightmares that you've interpreted
using as primary resources

222
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,720
A, your spotty memory,

223
00:19:00,928 --> 00:19:02,623
B, the Internet,

224
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:06,266
sacred sanctuary of idiots and nutters.
That's how they're gonna look at this.

225
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:08,935
And C, a crazy man's notebook,

226
00:19:09,136 --> 00:19:11,001
along with evidence you chewed
out of a man's back.

227
00:19:11,205 --> 00:19:13,332
All neatly stitched together
with a common thread

228
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,636
of a supremely powerful,
well-connected private equity fund,

229
00:19:17,845 --> 00:19:19,540
who, if you ever get
anywhere near them,

230
00:19:19,747 --> 00:19:21,305
will plead ignorance
and be shocked.

231
00:19:21,515 --> 00:19:22,607
Shocked to learn

232
00:19:22,816 --> 00:19:25,341
what some of their subsidiary
partners are engaged in.

233
00:19:25,552 --> 00:19:27,543
I could give a rat's ass
about Manchurian Global, sir.

234
00:19:27,755 --> 00:19:29,313
I could give a rat's ass about them.

235
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,881
That is not why I'm here.

236
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,088
I looked you up too, senator.

237
00:19:40,234 --> 00:19:41,895
Oh?

238
00:19:42,936 --> 00:19:44,733
You were in the Army.

239
00:19:44,938 --> 00:19:46,132
I was drafted.

240
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,070
Didn't make much of a soldier,
I'm afraid. Let me see this.

241
00:19:49,276 --> 00:19:52,040
That's not what I saw in the record.
That's not what the record says, sir.

242
00:19:52,246 --> 00:19:55,010
And you know how it works.

243
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,748
Wars are fought
one battle at a time.

244
00:19:57,951 --> 00:20:00,249
Battles, you win one bullet at a time.

245
00:20:00,454 --> 00:20:03,048
And I'd be lying to you if I said

246
00:20:03,257 --> 00:20:05,225
that I didn't factor in,
in a huge way,

247
00:20:05,426 --> 00:20:08,224
the fact that you have
a vested, personal,

248
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:11,193
political and patriotic interest
in how all of this shakes out.

249
00:20:11,398 --> 00:20:13,298
I'd be lying to you.

250
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:17,169
You're right, major.

251
00:20:17,805 --> 00:20:19,272
I do.

252
00:20:20,074 --> 00:20:24,135
A $5,000-a-plate dinner honoring
the CEO of Votron Incorporated,

253
00:20:24,344 --> 00:20:27,711
the nation's third-largest producer of
the controversial touch-screen units

254
00:20:27,915 --> 00:20:30,884
that will be used in the forthcoming
election, was disrupted last night,

255
00:20:31,085 --> 00:20:33,747
when protestors disguised as
waiters and kitchen staff

256
00:20:33,954 --> 00:20:36,821
unleashed a blizzard
of symbolic chants from above,

257
00:20:37,024 --> 00:20:38,389
resulting in a momentary panic.

258
00:20:38,592 --> 00:20:41,891
The supporters of presidential hopeful
Vice President Edward Nelson

259
00:20:42,096 --> 00:20:44,087
fled to exits and dove under tables.

260
00:20:44,298 --> 00:20:48,394
Security personnel quickly subdued
the protestors, one of whom...

261
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,333
The man is insane, Tom.

262
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:53,301
Full-blown schizophrenia.

263
00:20:53,507 --> 00:20:56,806
He's been stalking Raymond,
the FBI is all over this already.

264
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,035
I've seen the files.

265
00:20:59,713 --> 00:21:02,147
- Have you seen them?
- All over what?

266
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:06,544
Your bipolar war buddy
has been sharing his dreams

267
00:21:06,754 --> 00:21:08,415
with Senator Jordan.

268
00:21:09,022 --> 00:21:10,114
Hello, Raymond.

269
00:21:10,824 --> 00:21:13,224
Hello, senator.
How's Jocelyn?

270
00:21:13,427 --> 00:21:16,555
Have you fact-checked this
with anyone, Tom?

271
00:21:16,997 --> 00:21:18,555
Raymond.

272
00:21:22,202 --> 00:21:24,193
Do you recognize this man?

273
00:21:26,273 --> 00:21:27,638
No.

274
00:21:27,841 --> 00:21:29,934
His name is Atticus Noyle.

275
00:21:30,477 --> 00:21:32,843
He's a South African scientist
and mercenary.

276
00:21:33,046 --> 00:21:35,606
Someone our CIA turned to

277
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:39,013
for covert mind warfare
against the Soviets in Afghanistan.

278
00:21:39,219 --> 00:21:42,313
Someone who has sold
his technology and services

279
00:21:42,523 --> 00:21:45,287
to terrorists and rogue states.

280
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:47,784
And what does he
have to do with me?

281
00:21:48,862 --> 00:21:52,662
Major Bennett Marco
claims that this man...

282
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,194
...brainwashed you.

283
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:55,959
In his dreams.

284
00:21:56,703 --> 00:21:58,864
Contrived to have you win
the Medal of Honor.

285
00:21:59,373 --> 00:22:02,900
And has you poised to be the first
privately owned and operated

286
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,771
vice president of the United States.

287
00:22:04,978 --> 00:22:07,378
Sir, I've already spoken
with Ben Marco.

288
00:22:07,581 --> 00:22:10,175
Unfortunately, he's not a well man.

289
00:22:10,384 --> 00:22:11,715
He's delusional.

290
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,546
Nevertheless,

291
00:22:13,754 --> 00:22:16,154
he's pulled from his mad hat

292
00:22:16,356 --> 00:22:18,517
some remarkably lucid connections

293
00:22:18,725 --> 00:22:21,421
between his dreams
of your exploits in Kuwait

294
00:22:21,628 --> 00:22:23,357
and this Dr. Noyle

295
00:22:23,564 --> 00:22:25,828
and the private equity fund
Manchurian Global,

296
00:22:26,366 --> 00:22:29,631
your mother's primary political
benefactor for the past 15 years.

297
00:22:29,837 --> 00:22:32,533
Oh, come on, Tom.
They contribute to half the Senate.

298
00:22:32,739 --> 00:22:34,400
Both sides of the aisle.

299
00:22:34,608 --> 00:22:35,802
What are you saying?

300
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:40,469
At the time of Desert Storm,
Dr. Atticus Noyle

301
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:43,309
was working under a research grant
from Manchurian Global,

302
00:22:43,517 --> 00:22:46,179
developing deep implant
behavior modification.

303
00:22:46,386 --> 00:22:48,115
Oh, my God.

304
00:22:48,322 --> 00:22:50,381
Rogue scientists, mind control,
Manchurian Global.

305
00:22:50,591 --> 00:22:51,580
- You.
- Tom.

306
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:53,191
Connect the dots, Raymond.

307
00:22:53,393 --> 00:22:56,453
Where was your famous
Lost Patrol

308
00:22:56,663 --> 00:22:59,154
for those three missing days?

309
00:22:59,366 --> 00:23:02,824
Eluding capture in the desert?
Or somewhere else,

310
00:23:03,036 --> 00:23:06,164
being microwaved
by this Atticus Noyle?

311
00:23:06,373 --> 00:23:08,705
- Oh, Tom.
- I'm sorry, senator,

312
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:11,969
but what exactly
are you suggesting I do?

313
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,704
Bow out gracefully.

314
00:23:14,915 --> 00:23:16,507
Personal reasons,
an obscure illness.

315
00:23:16,984 --> 00:23:19,111
Yield your spot on the ticket
and go into seclusion.

316
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:21,116
Oh, that's what this is about.

317
00:23:21,321 --> 00:23:23,585
And then surrender yourself
to federal authorities.

318
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,485
Help them trace this thing
to its source

319
00:23:25,692 --> 00:23:28,525
and address whatever damage
may have been done to you.

320
00:23:28,729 --> 00:23:31,459
And I'll be waiting
for your press announcement

321
00:23:31,665 --> 00:23:32,893
first thing in the morning.

322
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,727
- And then we'll talk.
- Tom.

323
00:23:34,935 --> 00:23:37,995
If there's any inkling of truth
in any of these charges,

324
00:23:38,205 --> 00:23:40,435
if anyone has ever harmed
a hair on his head,

325
00:23:40,641 --> 00:23:41,869
I will find out about it.

326
00:23:42,075 --> 00:23:43,804
You have 12 hours, senator.

327
00:23:44,011 --> 00:23:46,479
But if it's not true,

328
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,046
I will see you impeached
on the floor of the Senate

329
00:23:49,249 --> 00:23:51,444
and bury you.

330
00:23:54,554 --> 00:23:56,044
Good night.

331
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,753
It's preposterous.

332
00:24:02,629 --> 00:24:04,824
Idiotic story.

333
00:24:05,832 --> 00:24:08,027
Mother, there's something
I have to tell you.

334
00:24:08,235 --> 00:24:09,259
What?

335
00:24:10,637 --> 00:24:13,401
I've been having the dreams.

336
00:24:14,474 --> 00:24:16,999
Ben said there were tests
they could run to see if...

337
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,644
No. Where are you going?

338
00:24:20,213 --> 00:24:21,544
Sergeant Shaw.

339
00:24:21,748 --> 00:24:23,238
What?

340
00:24:24,785 --> 00:24:27,117
Sergeant Raymond Shaw.

341
00:24:28,055 --> 00:24:29,716
Mother, I...

342
00:24:29,923 --> 00:24:33,154
Raymond Prentiss Shaw.

343
00:24:33,894 --> 00:24:35,452
Yes.

344
00:24:37,631 --> 00:24:39,258
Listen.

345
00:25:28,949 --> 00:25:30,211
Good morning to you all,

346
00:25:30,417 --> 00:25:32,612
and welcome to Amtrak's
northbound Acela,

347
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:36,277
making station stops
at Baltimore, Philadelphia,

348
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:39,015
Newark, New York's
Penn Station

349
00:25:39,226 --> 00:25:41,660
and Boston as the last stop...

350
00:25:53,607 --> 00:25:55,734
Who's that?

351
00:25:58,445 --> 00:26:00,106
It's Raymond, sir.

352
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:02,706
Oh, don't do that.

353
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:05,009
You're gonna get
soaking wet, Raymond.

354
00:26:07,054 --> 00:26:08,578
Raymond.

355
00:26:10,323 --> 00:26:12,450
I came to apologize, sir.

356
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,792
Raymond, what are you doing?

357
00:26:15,996 --> 00:26:18,464
- I'm sorry.
- We'll get some help for you, son.

358
00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:21,800
It's not your fault, Raymond.
It's not your fault.

359
00:26:22,235 --> 00:26:24,032
- I'm sorry, sir.
- It's your mother...

360
00:26:52,065 --> 00:26:53,430
Dad!

361
00:26:54,634 --> 00:26:56,124
Help!

362
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:05,944
Oh, God. Daddy!

363
00:27:07,581 --> 00:27:09,105
Help!

364
00:27:21,294 --> 00:27:23,558
Raymond? What are you doing?!

365
00:27:23,763 --> 00:27:28,132
What is going on?
What is happening?

366
00:27:29,136 --> 00:27:30,603
Where's my father?

367
00:27:30,804 --> 00:27:32,294
What are you doing?

368
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,906
Dad! Dad!

369
00:28:17,517 --> 00:28:18,882
The five-term senator

370
00:28:19,085 --> 00:28:22,384
and recent front-runner for his party's
vice presidential nomination

371
00:28:22,589 --> 00:28:24,682
appears to have
accidentally drowned

372
00:28:24,891 --> 00:28:28,918
when his kayak overturned near
his Chesapeake Bay weekend home.

373
00:28:29,196 --> 00:28:31,960
Police say his daughter,
35-year-old Jocelyn,

374
00:28:32,165 --> 00:28:33,860
may have been trying
to rescue Jordan

375
00:28:34,067 --> 00:28:37,730
when she was herself overcome
by the icy water.

376
00:28:37,971 --> 00:28:40,166
The bodies of Senator Jordan
and his daughter

377
00:28:40,373 --> 00:28:42,773
were discovered this morning
by a crab fisherman

378
00:28:42,976 --> 00:28:46,173
who spotted the capsized kayak
floating far offshore,

379
00:28:46,379 --> 00:28:49,075
nearly a mile from
Senator Jordan's residence.

380
00:28:49,282 --> 00:28:52,945
Neighbors say the senator was an
expert kayaker whose morning trips

381
00:28:53,153 --> 00:28:56,611
were a familiar sight along
the western bank of the Bay.

382
00:28:56,823 --> 00:28:59,951
Governor Arthur, do you have
any comment on this tragic event?

383
00:29:00,527 --> 00:29:04,623
Senator Jordan was a statesman
of the highest integrity.

384
00:29:05,198 --> 00:29:07,189
Tom Jordan was a friend.

385
00:29:07,601 --> 00:29:09,535
A damn fine man.

386
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,231
Just a great American.

387
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:15,465
That's all for now. We'll have
something for you a little later.

388
00:29:15,709 --> 00:29:18,269
They're the latest target of SEC
corruption probes,

389
00:29:18,478 --> 00:29:21,538
but private equity fund
Manchurian Global confirmed today

390
00:29:21,748 --> 00:29:25,309
it is continuing with plans to
finance privately owned combat units

391
00:29:25,518 --> 00:29:28,078
to relieve beleaguered
U.S. Troop deployments worldwide.

392
00:29:28,321 --> 00:29:32,382
It is a move that could save the
Defense Department billions of dollars.

393
00:29:34,327 --> 00:29:35,555
How does Arthur die?

394
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:37,829
You know who I'm talking about,
the new president.

395
00:29:38,031 --> 00:29:40,363
If he dies, Raymond Shaw becomes
the new president, doesn't he?

396
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:42,364
Chain of succession.
That's what you got in mind.

397
00:29:42,569 --> 00:29:43,729
That's what you people wanna do.

398
00:29:43,937 --> 00:29:45,996
You wanna really run the world,
don't you, Susie? Rosie?

399
00:29:46,206 --> 00:29:49,004
Whatever the hell your name is. I got
my library card and I got your tapes.

400
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:51,006
I do my research too.
We're going to the feds,

401
00:29:51,211 --> 00:29:54,112
we're going to the police,
the newspapers, whatever it takes.

402
00:29:54,848 --> 00:29:56,748
I am the feds.

403
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,918
Now, get off me!

404
00:30:03,189 --> 00:30:04,679
Get off of me!

405
00:30:16,803 --> 00:30:18,634
We found...

406
00:30:19,406 --> 00:30:21,601
...an implant device...

407
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:24,203
...in Al Melvin.

408
00:30:25,211 --> 00:30:27,111
You found one in Melvin.

409
00:30:27,314 --> 00:30:29,214
Just like you said.

410
00:30:31,718 --> 00:30:36,018
I'm part of a shadow unit.
We've been watching you.

411
00:30:37,557 --> 00:30:39,821
Trying to sort this thing out.

412
00:30:40,927 --> 00:30:42,622
This isn't an election, this is a coup.

413
00:30:42,829 --> 00:30:46,629
This is... In our own country,
a regime change, in our own country.

414
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:49,097
Ben, don't. Ben.

415
00:30:49,302 --> 00:30:53,739
This is rich people, Manchurian Global
funding bad science

416
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,673
to put a sleeper in the White House,
and that's what's going on, Rosie.

417
00:30:58,912 --> 00:31:01,176
- That's what's going on.
- I wanna believe you.

418
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:04,248
Well, then, believe me.
Help me. Help me.

419
00:31:04,451 --> 00:31:06,112
Shoot me, then.
Help me or shoot me.

420
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,786
Make a decision.

421
00:31:07,987 --> 00:31:10,148
Make a decision.

422
00:31:18,832 --> 00:31:21,460
I made a decision
when I met you, Ben.

423
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,007
Now, why don't you show me
what you have in your file.

424
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,841
- Sir!
- Congressman!

425
00:31:35,982 --> 00:31:38,473
Sir, do you have a statement
for us tonight?

426
00:31:40,153 --> 00:31:42,485
- Was exceptionally clear
and simple.

427
00:31:42,689 --> 00:31:45,317
A stronger, safer,
more profitable world

428
00:31:45,525 --> 00:31:48,358
through uncorruptible
top-level management.

429
00:31:48,628 --> 00:31:50,289
We trust you with our technology

430
00:31:50,497 --> 00:31:52,260
and suddenly you turn him
into a common hit man.

431
00:31:52,465 --> 00:31:55,263
How fucking dare you.
I trusted you with my son.

432
00:31:55,468 --> 00:31:56,526
You didn't even ask us...

433
00:31:56,736 --> 00:31:59,364
Don't lecture me! You swore to me
that this was fail-safe.

434
00:31:59,572 --> 00:32:01,836
No leaks, no glitches, no...
No dreams.

435
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:03,736
Not even a shadow of what was done
to Raymond...

436
00:32:03,943 --> 00:32:06,002
You needed to ask before you acted.
This is not a...

437
00:32:06,212 --> 00:32:08,840
Tom Jordan was going to destroy
my son and everything I've worked for,

438
00:32:09,048 --> 00:32:11,312
and every one of us along with it.
And you wanted me to what?

439
00:32:11,518 --> 00:32:13,782
- Call a meeting?
- Now, look, look, look.

440
00:32:15,188 --> 00:32:17,884
In the larger course of history...

441
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:20,115
...there are key players...

442
00:32:20,593 --> 00:32:22,720
...and role players, senator.

443
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:26,888
Bullshit! This is about my son
and the future of this country.

444
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:30,592
I thought we understood each other.

445
00:32:31,304 --> 00:32:33,329
I think we do. I think we really do.

446
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,134
- Your god is money.
- Oh, wait, wait, and yours is...?

447
00:32:36,342 --> 00:32:37,775
No, no. I'm a believer.

448
00:32:37,977 --> 00:32:39,911
I am an optimist.
I believe in the future.

449
00:32:40,113 --> 00:32:41,705
And people who do,
the ones who make history

450
00:32:41,915 --> 00:32:43,542
instead of just sitting around
watching it,

451
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,048
no, they're willing to take
the big risks.

452
00:32:46,252 --> 00:32:47,947
Yes, I made a decision.

453
00:32:48,555 --> 00:32:51,456
Oh, God! Where are
all the men anymore?

454
00:32:51,724 --> 00:32:53,817
My father, Tyler Prentiss,
never asked,

455
00:32:54,027 --> 00:32:56,461
"Is this okay? Is this okay?"

456
00:32:56,663 --> 00:32:58,631
You know what I'm saying, Mark?

457
00:32:58,832 --> 00:33:01,699
He just did what needed to be done.

458
00:33:02,402 --> 00:33:05,337
Come on, rise and shine, New York.
It's a big day in the Big Apple.

459
00:33:05,538 --> 00:33:08,974
That's right. All polls indicate
that New Yorkers will be turning out

460
00:33:09,175 --> 00:33:11,302
in record numbers today
across the five boroughs

461
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:13,069
to select a new president.

462
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,747
At least, that's how the billboard
says it's supposed to happen.

463
00:33:15,949 --> 00:33:17,473
The polls open at 6 a.m.

464
00:33:17,684 --> 00:33:21,085
And bars and taverns in Manhattan,
Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx,

465
00:33:21,287 --> 00:33:24,256
and Staten Island will be
opening shortly thereafter.

466
00:33:24,457 --> 00:33:28,325
That's right, New Yorkers. We are
free to drink and vote all day today.

467
00:33:45,845 --> 00:33:48,507
Thank you. Thank you.

468
00:33:48,715 --> 00:33:50,580
Thanks for coming out.

469
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,688
Congressman, good luck.

470
00:33:56,289 --> 00:33:59,190
- Hello.
- Hi.

471
00:34:00,426 --> 00:34:03,793
- Hey. Thank you very much.
- The next vice president, sir.

472
00:34:03,997 --> 00:34:05,328
I hope so.

473
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:08,398
- Let's have a win.
- We're with you. We're with you.

474
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,633
Thank you, Tony, take care.

475
00:34:13,907 --> 00:34:15,374
Thank you.

476
00:34:39,032 --> 00:34:42,001
Take care. Goodbye.
Thanks very much.

477
00:34:59,752 --> 00:35:01,276
It's clean.

478
00:35:05,558 --> 00:35:06,650
It's clean.

479
00:35:07,894 --> 00:35:09,486
It's all right, Evan.

480
00:35:17,503 --> 00:35:18,697
How's your back?

481
00:35:22,141 --> 00:35:24,473
I've been having the dreams, Ben.

482
00:35:25,311 --> 00:35:27,074
Oh, that's good.

483
00:35:28,014 --> 00:35:29,276
They're inside my head.

484
00:35:29,482 --> 00:35:30,881
We'll get them out. I got the proof.

485
00:35:31,084 --> 00:35:32,984
I know what they did to us.
I just don't know why.

486
00:35:33,186 --> 00:35:34,414
I dream things, Ben.

487
00:35:34,621 --> 00:35:36,953
Terrible things that can't
possibly have happened.

488
00:35:37,323 --> 00:35:39,314
- I'm gone, Ben...
- No, you're not, you're right here.

489
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:41,358
Ben...

490
00:35:42,261 --> 00:35:44,320
...there's something I want
you to have.

491
00:35:49,402 --> 00:35:51,267
I don't deserve this.

492
00:35:56,943 --> 00:35:58,342
Jocelyn's dead.

493
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:00,873
I know.

494
00:36:02,015 --> 00:36:03,312
And the senator.

495
00:36:05,351 --> 00:36:06,682
Yeah.

496
00:36:08,454 --> 00:36:10,217
Did I...?

497
00:36:12,492 --> 00:36:14,357
I think so, Raymond, yes.

498
00:36:15,695 --> 00:36:20,132
I don't remember, Ben.
I don't remember.

499
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,624
Raymond...

500
00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:25,936
...did they tell you what it is
they want you to do?

501
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:27,333
That's what I gotta find out.

502
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,805
We gotta find out what's gonna
happen, where it's gonna happen...

503
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:34,377
Are we friends, Ben?
I wanna believe we were friends.

504
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:39,347
We are connected and that's
something nobody can take from us.

505
00:36:40,253 --> 00:36:42,448
You could've had me locked up,
but you didn't.

506
00:36:42,655 --> 00:36:44,953
That's proof that there's something
deep inside.

507
00:36:45,158 --> 00:36:46,785
There's a part that they can't get to.

508
00:36:46,993 --> 00:36:49,518
And it's deep inside of us.
And that's where the truth is.

509
00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:52,755
That's our only hope. That's what
you and me need to tap into,

510
00:36:52,965 --> 00:36:55,866
and that's what you and I are gonna
use to take them out, Raymond.

511
00:36:56,069 --> 00:36:58,230
We don't have much time. Please.

512
00:37:00,873 --> 00:37:04,309
- I thought you were smarter than that.
- Raymond, please.

513
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,171
You don't think they saw this
coming, Ben?

514
00:37:07,146 --> 00:37:09,512
You don't think they factored you in?

515
00:37:12,151 --> 00:37:15,484
I am the enemy, Major Marco.

516
00:37:15,988 --> 00:37:17,819
What are you talking about?

517
00:37:22,729 --> 00:37:24,219
Yes, Mother.

518
00:37:25,531 --> 00:37:27,431
Yes, he's right here.

519
00:37:29,736 --> 00:37:32,227
- She wants you.
- Me?

520
00:37:36,409 --> 00:37:37,569
Yes, senator.

521
00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:40,746
- Is this Captain Marco?
- Yeah.

522
00:37:41,214 --> 00:37:43,876
Captain Bennett Marco?

523
00:37:44,617 --> 00:37:45,584
Yes.

524
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,655
Bennett Ezekiel Marco.

525
00:37:50,857 --> 00:37:52,415
Yes.

526
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,263
Listen.

527
00:38:31,898 --> 00:38:33,525
Hurry up!

528
00:38:46,412 --> 00:38:48,141
Major Marco?

529
00:39:00,793 --> 00:39:02,317
Ben?

530
00:39:03,996 --> 00:39:07,693
- People can get together whenever
they want and not get in trouble.

531
00:39:08,067 --> 00:39:11,161
People should be allowed to say
what is on their mind...

532
00:39:21,547 --> 00:39:22,912
The Bill of Rights gives people...

533
00:39:30,223 --> 00:39:31,417
Thank you.

534
00:39:31,624 --> 00:39:33,854
The candidates made ritual trips
to the voting booths today.

535
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,585
Governor Arthur,
casting his ballot in North Platte,

536
00:39:36,796 --> 00:39:39,526
will spend election night in the Big Apple
with running mate Raymond Shaw

537
00:39:39,732 --> 00:39:41,597
for their anticipated victory party.

538
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:44,429
The presidential rival,
incumbent Vice President Nelson

539
00:39:44,637 --> 00:39:47,105
returned to his home
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

540
00:39:47,306 --> 00:39:49,206
He attended special church services
this morning...

541
00:40:41,427 --> 00:40:43,395
- All clear.
- Raymond...

542
00:40:43,596 --> 00:40:45,120
- Clear.
...listen.

543
00:40:45,331 --> 00:40:49,791
The bullet will strike Bob Arthur
the moment you step forward

544
00:40:50,002 --> 00:40:52,800
and arrive on your star beside him.

545
00:40:53,005 --> 00:40:56,133
Because the assassin...

546
00:40:58,945 --> 00:41:01,914
...the deranged, obsessed...

547
00:41:02,114 --> 00:41:06,016
...tragically paranoid lone gunman...

548
00:41:06,218 --> 00:41:09,153
...is trying to kill you.

549
00:41:10,122 --> 00:41:12,613
Major Marco's
an excellent marksman.

550
00:41:13,292 --> 00:41:16,819
But you must stay very, very still

551
00:41:17,029 --> 00:41:20,465
and stand right where you're
supposed to stand.

552
00:41:20,967 --> 00:41:22,730
What happens to Ben?

553
00:41:24,003 --> 00:41:26,801
The assassin always dies, baby.

554
00:41:27,273 --> 00:41:30,037
It's necessary for
the national healing.

555
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:42,019
I'm sure you will never entirely
comprehend this, darling.

556
00:41:48,227 --> 00:41:50,695
But I want you to know, Raymond...

557
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,530
...I did this for you.

558
00:41:55,067 --> 00:41:57,763
So that you could have
what I couldn't.

559
00:41:58,371 --> 00:42:00,669
What your father threw away.

560
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,132
The opportunity to lead this nation.

561
00:42:06,445 --> 00:42:09,642
- I know, Mother.
- And so I let them take you

562
00:42:09,849 --> 00:42:11,749
and change you a little bit.

563
00:42:11,951 --> 00:42:14,010
Not so much that you would notice,

564
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:20,648
but just enough to bring you back
to who you really are.

565
00:42:23,195 --> 00:42:26,164
And to what you will become.

566
00:42:30,469 --> 00:42:32,664
Oh, and look at you.

567
00:42:34,173 --> 00:42:36,266
Look at you.
Look what you've achieved,

568
00:42:36,475 --> 00:42:39,967
look how far we've come.
It's working, Raymond.

569
00:42:41,414 --> 00:42:44,247
And you're going to save
our country now.

570
00:42:45,251 --> 00:42:48,846
In the hour of her greatest need.

571
00:42:50,656 --> 00:42:52,317
Yes, Mother.

572
00:42:56,595 --> 00:42:58,187
But...

573
00:43:02,268 --> 00:43:04,463
But when you smile...

574
00:43:05,404 --> 00:43:10,000
...oh, darling, when you smile,
that's what I live for.

575
00:43:12,078 --> 00:43:14,945
When you smile.

576
00:43:26,325 --> 00:43:28,350
Well, it's official.
CBS News now projects

577
00:43:28,561 --> 00:43:30,859
Robert Arthur and Raymond Shaw
to be the next president

578
00:43:31,063 --> 00:43:32,928
and vice president
of the United States.

579
00:43:33,132 --> 00:43:37,159
With at least 270 electoral votes
and support of almost 70 percent

580
00:43:37,369 --> 00:43:38,961
of votes tallied tonight.

581
00:43:39,171 --> 00:43:40,934
Arthur and running mate
Raymond Shaw are leading

582
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,630
in all but one remaining race,

583
00:43:42,842 --> 00:43:45,777
in the sitting vice president's
home state of Louisiana.

584
00:44:01,794 --> 00:44:03,853
Wait, Jimmy. Jimmy, wait.

585
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,522
Wait. Go back.
Can you go back?

586
00:44:05,731 --> 00:44:06,959
Yeah.

587
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:13,534
- Stop.
- Sure.

588
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:15,902
Now, can you zoom in on that guy?

589
00:44:16,108 --> 00:44:17,302
Yep.

590
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:20,440
No, no, Jimmy, the other one. The one
in the back. The one in the shades.

591
00:44:20,646 --> 00:44:22,546
- This one?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

592
00:44:28,487 --> 00:44:30,682
Never mind. Thanks, Jimmy.

593
00:44:54,914 --> 00:44:58,077
Arthur! That's right!

594
00:44:58,284 --> 00:45:01,913
Arthur! Arthur!

595
00:45:30,783 --> 00:45:33,081
- We did it. Wow.
- Yeah!

596
00:45:34,053 --> 00:45:35,384
All right! Yes!

597
00:45:35,921 --> 00:45:37,855
- Yes.
- Hi.

598
00:45:48,467 --> 00:45:50,560
Thank you. Thank you.

599
00:45:51,036 --> 00:45:52,833
Thank you.

600
00:46:02,014 --> 00:46:05,108
Let's have a good show, people.
Let's have a really good show, okay?

601
00:46:06,452 --> 00:46:11,253
Arthur! Arthur! Arthur! Arthur!

602
00:46:11,824 --> 00:46:13,257
Cue screens.

603
00:46:19,331 --> 00:46:20,730
Very good.

604
00:46:27,673 --> 00:46:29,334
Stand by with the first music cue.

605
00:46:29,742 --> 00:46:31,175
Now, music.

606
00:47:56,128 --> 00:47:57,390
Okay.

607
00:48:27,259 --> 00:48:29,523
Damn it.
Shaw missed his first position.

608
00:50:56,375 --> 00:50:58,741
AOP! AOP!

609
00:50:58,944 --> 00:51:00,468
Up there!

610
00:51:26,038 --> 00:51:27,027
Ben!

611
00:51:30,609 --> 00:51:31,598
Ben!

612
00:51:57,669 --> 00:52:00,536
All right. Bye.

613
00:52:56,128 --> 00:52:58,653
The FBI has just released
security footage

614
00:52:58,864 --> 00:53:01,424
of the assassin of Raymond
and Eleanor Prentiss Shaw

615
00:53:01,633 --> 00:53:04,727
entering the hotel two hours
before the fatal shooting.

616
00:53:04,936 --> 00:53:08,463
Authorities have identified
the gunman as Klaus Bachmann.

617
00:53:08,674 --> 00:53:11,643
Bachmann was believed to have been
killed in a car bomb explosion

618
00:53:11,843 --> 00:53:14,141
in Chechnya four years ago.

619
00:53:14,346 --> 00:53:16,610
He was employed there as a
covert operation specialist

620
00:53:16,815 --> 00:53:18,407
by Global Endeavors,

621
00:53:18,617 --> 00:53:22,815
a U.K. Subsidiary of the equity fund
giant Manchurian Global.

622
00:53:23,021 --> 00:53:25,751
A second former Manchurian Global
civilian contractor

623
00:53:25,957 --> 00:53:27,948
was taken into custody
by federal agents

624
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,993
at Chicago's O'Hare Airport
early this morning.

625
00:53:31,196 --> 00:53:34,256
Laurence Tokar made news
during the Gulf War

626
00:53:34,466 --> 00:53:38,197
for his presence on Raymond Shaw's
famed Lost Patrol.

627
00:53:38,403 --> 00:53:41,930
Tokar was missing in action after
the ambush that resulted in Shaw

628
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:44,768
being awarded the
Congressional Medal of Honor.

629
00:53:44,976 --> 00:53:48,707
Authorities are exploring additional
connections between the two men.

630
00:53:48,914 --> 00:53:52,441
Still reeling from the recent tragic loss
of Senator Thomas Jordan,

631
00:53:52,651 --> 00:53:55,586
Congress has already announced
a far-reaching investigation

632
00:53:55,787 --> 00:53:57,015
into Jordan's death,

633
00:53:57,222 --> 00:54:01,955
in an effort to learn if it is in any way
related to the Shaw assassinations.

634
00:54:02,527 --> 00:54:06,520
In a supercharged encounter
moments ago, president-elect Arthur...

635
00:54:47,973 --> 00:54:49,998
I remember running.

636
00:54:50,909 --> 00:54:52,240
I had to...

637
00:54:52,978 --> 00:54:54,536
...get out...

638
00:54:56,515 --> 00:54:58,813
...to where the sky was. And had to...

639
00:54:59,951 --> 00:55:03,546
...get to the water.
Escape. Regroup.

640
00:55:03,989 --> 00:55:05,354
Come back, get my men.

641
00:55:05,557 --> 00:55:09,357
I thought that if I could just
get to the water...

642
00:55:10,662 --> 00:55:12,721
...everything would be okay.

643
00:55:13,465 --> 00:55:15,933
If I could just get to the water.

00:56:31,443 --> 00:56:34,003
Now, when you're rescued
and returned with your patrol

645
00:56:34,212 --> 00:56:35,679
to command headquarters,

646
00:56:35,881 --> 00:56:39,647
what will be among the first
of your duties that you'll undertake?

647
00:56:39,851 --> 00:56:43,184
I'll recommend Sergeant Shaw
for the Medal of Honor, sir.

648
00:56:43,455 --> 00:56:45,389
He saved our lives.

649
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:49,458
He terminated the enemy.
Led us across the desert to safety.

650
00:56:49,661 --> 00:56:52,289
Excellent. And there were casualties?

651
00:56:52,497 --> 00:56:55,295
There's always casualties in war, sir.
