1
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:40,648
As a child, I had visions.
Sometimes they would come true.

2
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:43,662
As I got older I started to dismiss them.

3
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:48,463
Then my sister was murdered in Germany
and the visions started again.

4
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,164
So I left the States for Germany
hoping to find some answers,

5
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:57,805
But what I found was far beyond
anything I ever expected.

6
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,675
I saw people die.

7
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,781
Please! Forgive me...

8
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,781
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry.

9
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,198
Please... please...

10
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:33,085
Why couldn't I stop thinking about that?

11
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,790
Shit. Shit happens sometimes...

12
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:45,065
Couldn't I?
No.

13
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,908
...none of my business.

14
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,846
...the corpse was his job.

15
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:04,651
Nothing can happen to me...
Or it could?

16
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:13,557
I don't wanna go to jail again.

17
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:19,927
Nobody would have known...
NOBODY!

18
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:27,611
And Kathrine? I don't know...
she's not important to me.

19
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:13,716
Hello.

20
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,998
Donnie who?

21
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:56,296
Hey Sarah. What's up?
When are you leaving?

22
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,037
Well, why don't I go with you?

23
00:09:02,038 --> 00:09:05,704
Yeah, I've got friends there
that might be able to help.

24
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:08,041
They are paranormal investigators

25
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,645
Okay, great. See you then. Bye.

26
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:27,862
God, I really hate nature ghosts man.
They're too damn fucking clever.

27
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:35,864
Not that clever, only smarter than you are!

28
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,185
Year after year we go out there
and let him fuck with us...

29
00:09:40,186 --> 00:09:42,146
I mean aren't you a
little tired of this?

30
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:44,609
No.

31
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,089
Aunt Rose!

32
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,688
Hello. Yes he's here.

33
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,094
Hi, Aunt Rose.

34
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,327
No... I don't think your
new puppy is a werewolf.

35
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,100
Uhm... miniature werewolf!
A lycanthro-doodle!

36
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,876
No, I'm here. Yes. Sam is here too.
- Hello!

37
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,946
Yes, oh wow.
Pie with dinner tonight? WOW.

38
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:26,522
Uhm no, we gotta go.
Yes, chase more ghosts.

39
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:32,119
Yes, so it's a big case, okay?!
Ok, we love you. All right. Bye.

40
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,535
Lycanthro-doodle?!?!

41
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,746
Oh yes yes yes
A "Lycanthrodoodle"...

42
00:10:42,747 --> 00:10:47,169
it's a cross between a werewolf and
a poodle. A LY-CAN-THRO-DOODLE...

43
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,144
It's cool... isn't it?

44
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,477
Yes. It's the best one you ever made up.

45
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,384
So, umm...
Are you are ready to call it a night?

46
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:04,486
Oh, no. I'll work a little longer.
Five against one...

47
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,932
Man, I don't know.
What's up tomorrow?

48
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,837
Umm, Donnie is flying in.
-Oh!

49
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,705
Didn't I tell you?
- No.

50
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:22,510
That could be really nice...
It's been about five years since he moved...

51
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,913
and...
he's bringing a friend.

52
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:28,186
Aha... who?
- A friend.

53
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,138
Who?
- A friend?

54
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:32,217
- WHO?!
- A woman friend.

55
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:36,191
Who?!?!...Umm... Sa... Sar...
Are you a fucking owl?

56
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:44,274
So, anyways... All right
man. I'll go to bed.

57
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:45,795
- Have a good one.
- Yes.

58
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:47,913
Good night.

59
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:51,039
- Enjoy your arm wrestling.
- Yeah, wet dreams baby.

60
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:16,954
What happened?
Tell me now!

61
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:25,025
For the last time,
I have no idea what happened to Mike!

62
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,899
I'm done talking about Mike!

63
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,573
You killed him, didn't you?!

64
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,677
What are you gonna do?
Call the police?

65
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:43,913
Is there something you're not telling me?
- No, God damn it!

66
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,454
Leave me alone!

67
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:50,655
Calm down!
- You're a fucking asshole, Chris!

68
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:54,012
Kath, I swear I don't
know what happened to Mike,

69
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:55,325
or who's responsible!

70
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:59,269
Believe me...
Believe me.

71
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:14,948
If you didn't do anything,
then why not go to the police?

72
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,246
Because they'll think I killed him.

73
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:21,421
You might as well just kiss
my ass goodbye after that.

74
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,130
I don't know.

75
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:48,650
Hello.
- Same place, same time. No, I'm still there.

76
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:56,121
No traces yet.
We're asking the neighborhood.

77
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,623
I can't talk any more.

78
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:05,392
Who was it?
Tell me.

79
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,407
I'm gonna go take a shower.

80
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,433
What's up, bro?!
- Man!

81
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,300
Donnie.

82
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:40,438
- Hey Sam.
- Howdy.

83
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:45,248
Sam, this is Sarah. She is
a little bit tired and yes...

84
00:15:45,249 --> 00:15:47,434
She's American.
- Of course she is.

85
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:50,999
Nice to meet you.

86
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,748
My name is Sam, but
you can call me Sammy.

87
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,986
And I am the good looking half of the...
- C'mon guys, cut the crap.

88
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:00,382
Sit down.

89
00:16:00,383 --> 00:16:02,460
- Hi Sammy
- Hi Sarah.

90
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,136
This isn't purely a social call.

91
00:16:09,137 --> 00:16:11,660
Do you recognize the
name Tanja Campbell?

92
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,383
Campbell... Campbell, wait...

93
00:16:15,384 --> 00:16:20,210
Yeah, wasn't she the girl
who was raped and murdered...

94
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,879
Yeah, I remember seeing
her stuff all over the news.

95
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:27,846
Yes, but slow down. She was her sister.
- Ooh. Bullseye.

96
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:34,065
You know, Sarah and I met in
Chicago and became friends.

97
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:39,487
I showed her some photos from the
fatherland just the other day and...

98
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,971
Don't keep us in suspense "Mr. Medium"
- She recognized someone.

99
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,736
And you've never been in Germany?

100
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:52,601
- No.
- Right!

101
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,536
She's seen him in her
dreams and she's convinced

102
00:16:57,537 --> 00:17:01,185
that this is the guy
who killed her sister.

103
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:15,829
This is the guy whose in your dreams?
-Yes.

104
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,989
I hate to break it to
you, but this dude is dead.

105
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,440
He was slaughtered in his home.

106
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,171
Just a few days ago.

107
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,644
Damn.
- I mean ripped to shreds.

108
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,639
He was Tanja's boyfriend,
and she was pregnant

109
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,543
with their baby
when she was killed.

110
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:43,082
I have a friend at
the police station.

111
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:47,211
He sent me some crime scene
photos from this murder.

112
00:17:47,212 --> 00:17:51,962
I have them on my laptop.
Maybe we can find something in there.

113
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,299
Sammy. Laptop!

114
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,373
Mr. President!
- Thank you.

115
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,588
Look. I can see something!

116
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:17,459
It's the cursor... It's the cursor!

117
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:23,165
You said this guys were close.
Is that the best you can do?

118
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:28,219
Guys...

119
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:35,605
Well, it definitely seems to be spectral
anomaly. It's ectoplasmic in nature...

120
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:40,946
It is not a fucking orb... this guy...
body after the murder...

121
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,323
No. It looks female...

122
00:18:43,324 --> 00:18:47,649
You can tell from that?
It just looks like a blur to me.

123
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,627
Can I see the screen?

124
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:59,202
That's Tanja.
- Guys, let's get back to reality!

125
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:03,630
Do you know a guy named, umm...
Christian Van DerStraaten?

126
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,201
Yeah, sure.
That is this guy's buddy.

127
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,025
Umm, well... Sarah thinks
her dreams are a sign...

128
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,443
A sign from her dead sister.

129
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:18,814
I feel that she's telling me
that until her murder is resolved,

130
00:19:18,815 --> 00:19:20,453
she can't rest in peace.

131
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,592
Yes, how can we help?

132
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,893
I need you help me
find that Christian guy.

133
00:19:25,894 --> 00:19:28,655
I think he and Mike
murdered my sister.

134
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:34,263
And I'm not gonna rest until I find him
and put him to justice.

135
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,899
Whatever it takes.

136
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,238
We're not talking about
anything illegal, are we?

137
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:49,781
I am really tired, you guys.
I have very bad jet-lag.

138
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,498
Okay, since you're
a guest in our house,

139
00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:56,657
you can have my bed
and I'll take the sofa.

140
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:01,325
No! My bed is much better! So...
- She can have my bed!

141
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,733
She can have MY bed! Use my bed...
- My bed is nice!

142
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:07,381
You know what?
I just gonna take the sofa.

143
00:20:07,382 --> 00:20:09,900
I don't wanna put you out.
It's fine and...

144
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:10,259
No!

145
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,672
- Yes!
- I'll go back to the hotel...

146
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,410
I'm dead on my feet and...

147
00:20:15,411 --> 00:20:18,739
No! This is great.
There are two free beds here...

148
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,438
...why don't you stay with me?

149
00:20:20,439 --> 00:20:21,411
- NO! NO! NO!
- No!

150
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,360
No!
- He's dead tired.

151
00:20:23,361 --> 00:20:25,243
- I'll pay for the hotel

152
00:20:25,244 --> 00:20:27,516
- Yes!
- I can cancel my room!

153
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,833
No! No! Yes...

154
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:32,439
- We'll pay for the hotel.
Company Business...

155
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:32,822
- Yes!

156
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:33,518
You stay here!

157
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:36,527
You stay here! You can use my bed.
- You'll call me in the morning?

158
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,032
I will, yes.
- Thank you.

159
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,865
Guys! See ya!
- Bye, Donnie. Bye.

160
00:20:48,866 --> 00:20:51,044
- See you, man.
Good night.

161
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,282
Okay. I can find it by myself.

162
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:07,220
What? She's hot, huh?

163
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,767
Shut up!
- Ey! She is hot!

164
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,570
Stop.
-She's not hot?

165
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:16,763
Stop.
- What the fuck?!

166
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,121
You have to believe me.

167
00:21:49,122 --> 00:21:51,798
I didn't have anything
to do with Mike's murder!

168
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,836
That's all you've got for me?

169
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,739
I don't know anything!

170
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:00,810
I could arrest you!

171
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:05,145
I know.
But you don't wanna do that.

172
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:12,296
I have to know who killed him!
Don't waste my time!

173
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,494
I have no idea what happened to him,
or who killed him!

174
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:18,806
Hey, I like you.

175
00:22:18,807 --> 00:22:21,498
And if you were an idiot,
I wouldn't like you.

176
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,469
All right, man.

177
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,737
Please, just don't hurt me here.

178
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:31,178
- I won't hurt you.
I'm only here to help.

179
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:37,845
Don't forget.
Every one of us is a criminal.

180
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:42,157
I'll go my way and you go your's.

181
00:22:42,158 --> 00:22:45,659
And don't ask Kathrine anything.
She knows nothing.

182
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,866
Tell her I said hi.

183
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,605
Hey. Good morning.

184
00:23:32,606 --> 00:23:34,473
- Hey, I made you some coffee.
- Thanks.

185
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:41,384
It's good.
- Thanks.

186
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,582
Everything okay?

187
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:51,327
Yes. Yes it's okay.
I was thinking about my dad.

188
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,526
You wanna talk about?

189
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:03,936
He used to be in the army
here in Germany and... uhh...

190
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:10,380
...he blames me for telling Tanja...
I mean yeah, I told her to come...

191
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,747
...here so she could follow her dreams.

192
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:18,286
Live your own life.
Do what you wanna do.

193
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:21,385
I mean she wasn't having
any luck in the States so... why not?

194
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,790
And what was her dream?

195
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:27,493
She wanted to be a model.

196
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:39,140
When she died, my dad blamed me.
He said when she died, he died.

197
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:49,143
And I'm not his punching bag.
- Ya know...

198
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,545
Sometimes, when someone dies,

199
00:24:52,546 --> 00:24:56,583
family members like to
place the blame on others.

200
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:02,761
I felt guilty.
I thought I was guilty.

201
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:05,594
But I know it's not my fault.

202
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:10,535
I came here because I need to find out.
I wanna know.

203
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,011
And knowing is half the battle.

204
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:45,039
Come in.

205
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,671
Hey.
- Hey.

206
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:55,046
I thought you were tired.
- I am. I'm exhausted.

207
00:25:55,487 --> 00:26:00,322
And every time I lay down,
I see that bastard's face.

208
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,723
It really makes me sick.

209
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,722
Yeah... I have nights like that too.

210
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:08,565
You wanna talk about?

211
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,821
I just wanna calm down, ya know?

212
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:15,738
I just want to relax and
get some rest tonight.

213
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,802
You know what I mean?

214
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:22,872
So, tell me about Sarah.

215
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,413
Sarah? Okay.

216
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:31,628
Let's see. I was
born in New Jersey.

217
00:26:31,629 --> 00:26:35,886
My mother died when
I was three years old.

218
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:40,825
So my father raised
Tanja and I by himself.

219
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:46,370
He later moved to Frankfurt...
Got another wife...

220
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:51,466
...and I went to Chicago. I studied.
I was a history major.

221
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:56,213
And I never left. That's about it

222
00:26:56,748 --> 00:27:00,115
How about you?
- This is it.

223
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:06,112
Hooked up with Sammy...
started the company.

224
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:10,321
You know... the better looking half of the...
German...

225
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,299
Is that my file?
- Uh, yes.

226
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:21,863
There's an "H" in Sarah.
- Yes, I know... Good eye on that.

227
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:30,136
So what you think?
- Uh, it's coming along.

228
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:36,620
We, uhh... I think we might have something.
- Thanks.

229
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,976
Thanks for the coffee.

230
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,712
Fuck you.
They're both for me.

231
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,525
What's up?

232
00:28:18,526 --> 00:28:23,999
It's Kathrin. I'm afraid she's
going to talk... about everything.

233
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,539
Buy something for her.
Money makes the world go 'round.

234
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,204
Simple. Communicate with her.

235
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:37,319
This is hardcore, man...

236
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,445
and I don't wanna meet you in public
again where everybody can see us.

237
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,550
You're still paying me off.
How long will we do this?

238
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:48,214
The question isn't how long.
It's how far.

239
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:01,401
Tom. Can you call the detective?

240
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:04,237
I could. But they're not gonna show you her file.

241
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,241
And they don't have any information
that we don't already have.

242
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,247
Please. Call him.

243
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:35,295
Yes. My name is Tom Snyder.
Can I speak to Detective Teppert please?

244
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:42,910
Sorry. Mein name ist Tom Snyder. Kann ich mit
Commisar Teppert sprechen?

245
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:49,052
Thanks. Yeah.

246
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,346
Thanks a lot, Detective Teppert. Bye.

247
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:53,702
Well?!

248
00:29:53,703 --> 00:29:56,725
Okay. He's gonna meet
with you in ten minutes.

249
00:29:57,328 --> 00:30:00,297
Down the street there is a parking lot
where he's gonna meet you.

250
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:03,964
You don't wanna go?
- No he wants to meet you alone.

251
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:07,902
I'll stay here... milking the goats.

252
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,638
Milking the goats?

253
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,972
Thanks.

254
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,336
Teppert?
- Yes.

255
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,338
Look.
I need to know what happened to my sister.

256
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:43,966
We don't know anything.
We can't help you.

257
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:47,133
This is incredibly ridiculous.
A woman was killed.

258
00:30:47,134 --> 00:30:50,345
You don't have finger prints,
trace evidence? Nothing?!

259
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:55,015
No fingerprints, no traces evidence.
Nothing.

260
00:30:56,387 --> 00:31:00,328
This is insane! Look. I've been
having visions of her murder.

261
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:02,553
I think somebody
murdered my sister.

262
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:08,156
Visions?
We're not psychics. We are police!

263
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,121
Fine. I'll do it myself then.

264
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:15,639
You'd better not.
- Why?

265
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:20,366
I'm sorry. We can't do anything...
And neither can you.

266
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:25,382
Visions don't help you.
- We'll see about that.

267
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:28,498
You know what?

268
00:31:28,499 --> 00:31:32,550
If you'd just do your fucking job I
wouldn't be in this position right now.

269
00:31:32,551 --> 00:31:35,056
You know what I mean?!
Just do your fucking job.

270
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:39,393
Listen! Go back to the States.
We don't want you here!

271
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,398
Who is we?

272
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:46,171
Get a cab, buy a plane
ticket, and leave Germany. Now.

273
00:31:46,172 --> 00:31:48,395
That's the best you can do.

274
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:49,086
You know what?

275
00:31:49,087 --> 00:31:51,408
This is a really good police
force here. Thanks a lot.

276
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:56,103
Right! And you have to leave.
The earlier the better.

277
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:04,012
Tell her she has to leave,
if she's a friend of your's.

278
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:07,583
And whose speaking?
- ME!

279
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,188
Fuck you.
-What?!

280
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:17,195
Thank you. Thank you.

281
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:35,239
You okay?

282
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:39,650
I think I'm gonna puke.

283
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,258
Kath, are you alright?

284
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:04,530
You need to stop mixing all
that shit together or it'll kill you.

285
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:31,158
I swear that's never happened to me before.

286
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:40,139
Donnie. What's up man?

287
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:44,775
We're just working on Sarah's file.
- I see.

288
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:50,585
Speaking of Sarah...
So, she sees Christian in her dreams?

289
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:53,860
Now, is this the first time
she's had these visions or

290
00:34:53,861 --> 00:34:57,356
is she just recreating something
that she's seen in the past?

291
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:01,364
No, she is not recreating.
She made those sketches of his face...

292
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:04,333
...and saw the photos, like,
three weeks later.

293
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:07,459
So maybe Tanja's soul is restless.

294
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,966
Do you think she had something
to do with Mike's murder?

295
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,272
Sarah?
- No, her sister!

296
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,158
I think the question is "why".

297
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:17,940
Mike was a damn good
friend of Chris', so...

298
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:22,296
Well, if she were a revenge
spirit, yes. That would be it.

299
00:35:22,297 --> 00:35:26,286
But then we'd be dealing with
more victims, wouldn't we?

300
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:29,859
Yes. Maybe she's trying to
reach out to the astral plane...

301
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,260
and give Sarah a message?

302
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:35,265
Yes, that's what I think.
- Well, yeah...

303
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,438
...everyone related to the
murder will be killed...

304
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:43,035
but they'd have to be directly related,
either in the murder or covering it up.

305
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,629
Okay. So, as an entity,

306
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:56,411
she can't leave the confined
areas of the victims.

307
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:05,321
Which means she can't
leave the area she knows.

308
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:39,755
But if she IS a revenge
spirit... what then?

309
00:37:39,756 --> 00:37:42,987
She has free will and
can go wherever she wants.

310
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,070
Donnie. Who is Sarah... really?

311
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,694
She was calling me, trying
to make an appointment.

312
00:38:12,695 --> 00:38:15,115
Uhm, but she stood me up
for the first few times.

313
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:19,626
And all of a sudden she was
standing at my front door.

314
00:38:19,627 --> 00:38:21,187
That's how it all started.

315
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,063
Sarah. We need to help Sarah.

316
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:36,473
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do?

317
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,202
Uhm, Tom... But
she's not dangerous,

318
00:38:39,203 --> 00:38:41,110
if that was what you
were wondering about.

319
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:41,671
Okay.

320
00:38:41,672 --> 00:38:46,817
And we need to help Sarah.
- Okay, see you guys later.

321
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,827
Pizza?

322
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:16,416
Hello?! Don't call this number!

323
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,584
Fuck...

324
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:36,009
What the fuck?! No...

325
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:41,406
but maybe the American woman is
a bigger problem than I thought.

326
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:51,377
Do whatever you want...
I'm erasing some important stuff...

327
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:55,653
Maybe you should take off, too.

328
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:25,470
Didn't I tell you to dump it!?

329
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:33,812
Why didn't you listen to me!? Huh?!
- Leave me alone! NOW!

330
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:41,081
Maybe I should bury you too, huh?
- Do it, God damn it!

331
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:45,422
Blow my brains out! Violence...
that's your solution for everything!

332
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:55,066
I can't trust you anymore.

333
00:42:56,106 --> 00:43:01,066
Why do you still have it? Huh?!

334
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:03,613
No. Don't do this.
- What?! Huh? Don't do what?!

335
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:05,478
Please. You can trust me Chris...

336
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:10,748
Why do you still have it? Huh?!

337
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:14,403
I'm wondering now if
maybe you didn't kill Mike.

338
00:43:14,404 --> 00:43:18,823
The paper said he was shot with a pistol,
and here you are with one.

339
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:20,448
A shotgun!

340
00:43:20,449 --> 00:43:23,094
The newspaper said he
was killed with a shotgun!

341
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:29,196
Hmm... I guess you're right. It said Shotgun, huh?
And this here is a pistol, right?

342
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:34,542
Christian, I love you... please don't do this!

343
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:41,106
So, what do you think I should do?

344
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:45,849
Hey, hey. Calm down.

345
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:51,120
Put the gun down.

346
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:04,136
Do you know where he lives, Tom?

347
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:09,136
Sarah, don't. That'd be a big mistake.

348
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:13,606
But you have his address, don't you?

349
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:18,444
Yes. But I'm not gonna give it to you.
- Great.

350
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:20,805
Why not?!
- What do you wanna do?

351
00:44:20,806 --> 00:44:24,263
Go over there and kick open his
door and say, "Hi, I'm Sarah.

352
00:44:24,264 --> 00:44:26,159
You raped and murdered my sister?!"

353
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:30,107
No, I'm not gonna do that,
but I've gotta go over there.

354
00:44:30,108 --> 00:44:31,167
C'mon, take me to him.

355
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:36,502
I really need your help, Tom. Please.

356
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:06,964
Your aim still sucks.

357
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:11,011
Shut up, you bastard.
You make me sick.

358
00:45:11,012 --> 00:45:14,199
Everything has to be
done your way, doesn't it?

359
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:21,402
You think you're the only one
who knows how to do anything.

360
00:45:21,403 --> 00:45:23,852
You really make me sick!

361
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:28,328
Well, what's keeping you here then?
Leave if you want.

362
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:29,988
I'm not gonna stop you.

363
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:37,996
Go away! Now!
-We both know what'll happen if I do that.

364
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:42,238
What'll happen then? Huh?!

365
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:04,260
C'mon. Please.

366
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:15,271
Bullshit!

367
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:21,916
I want to be able to
take it all back...

368
00:46:21,917 --> 00:46:25,612
forget it all happened.
Forget about Tanja!

369
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:28,242
She's always with me.

370
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:32,277
Whenever I close my eyes,
I dream about her.

371
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:41,273
When I'm awake, I can't
stop thinking about her.

372
00:46:41,274 --> 00:46:44,226
It drives me insane!

373
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:55,961
Dwelling on the past isn't
going to do you any good.

374
00:46:55,962 --> 00:47:01,309
What's done is done. You need
to suck it up and move on.

375
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:09,648
Chris... I was pregnant.
- What?!

376
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:15,320
Was... was it mine?

377
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:30,011
What happened?
Why are you telling me this now?

378
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:38,912
An abortion...
- What?!

379
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:44,950
You did what?!
- I had an abortion!

380
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:56,361
It was my baby too!
- Your baby?!

381
00:47:57,441 --> 00:48:02,105
And you murdered it,
just like you murdered Tanja!

382
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:06,905
You know why I did it!

383
00:48:06,906 --> 00:48:09,818
Don't pretend I'm the
only guilty one here.

384
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,694
You fucked her...
you and Mike both did!

385
00:48:14,695 --> 00:48:17,020
I did what I had to to protect you.

386
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:22,054
So now you're the hero,
and Mike and I are the villains?

387
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:25,236
I don't think so, sweetie.

388
00:48:25,237 --> 00:48:29,038
You and I are up to our
necks in the same shit.

389
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:33,076
Why couldn't we just keep our mouths
closed and forget it ever happened?

390
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:34,889
Just like that, huh?

391
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:38,142
We don't talk about it
and everything's okay?

392
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:55,426
So what you gotta do when we get there?
- Nothing.

393
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:02,060
You think this is easy for me?

394
00:49:02,061 --> 00:49:06,033
I'm the one that pulled
the trigger, remember?

395
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:16,177
Her blood is all over MY hands.
I can't forget it.

396
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:21,446
No! I can't forget it.

397
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:30,962
Then let's go to the police,
put an end to this shit once and for all.

398
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,570
Do whatever you think is right.

399
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:38,679
Kathrin, I don't want
one of us to do something

400
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,806
we're going to regret
for the rest of our lives.

401
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:43,812
It's too late. We've already done it!

402
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:46,019
I'd turn back the clock if I could.

403
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,814
Make it so none of this happened...
but it doesn't work that way.

404
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:54,118
Thinking about it all
the time is killing me.

405
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:56,151
I don't think I can
take it any more.

406
00:49:58,195 --> 00:49:59,162
That's bullshit!

407
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:04,830
What was that sound?!
- There's nothing here.

408
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:11,267
I heard something...
- There's nothing here!

409
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:36,292
Look... there is nothing here!
- Shut up, Kathrin, okay?

410
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:45,541
I swear to God that I heard something!

411
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:08,564
I heard something.

412
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:23,872
Get in the car!

413
00:52:23,873 --> 00:52:27,632
That's not my sister! That's not her!
- Sarah!

414
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:33,308
Get in the car!

415
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:53,760
What the fuck was that?!
I thought we'd be dealing with Tanja's spirit.

416
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:59,492
Well, yeah... sometimes when a person has
been brutally murdered or wronged in anyway,

417
00:52:59,493 --> 00:53:02,677
their soul can call back an...
an avenging spirit.

418
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,007
What the fuck is avenging spirit?
It's, it is...

419
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:09,813
It's used to lash out to those who
wronged or hurt the person.

420
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:12,286
And, and, and?!
- And she is pretty fucking pissed!

421
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:12,986
Yes, no shit!

422
00:53:12,987 --> 00:53:14,540
And she's not gonna stop killing

423
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:17,452
until she finds everyone who
is involved in Tanja's murder!

424
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:21,694
I gotta call Sam.
- Just wait a minute!

425
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:26,930
Okay. Mike's already dead.

426
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:30,012
I need you to tell me who is
involved in Tanja's murder.

427
00:53:30,013 --> 00:53:31,702
I need the information right now!

428
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:23,906
Sam! Yes... we're not
dealing with Sarah's sister.

429
00:54:23,907 --> 00:54:25,326
It's a revenge spirit.

430
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:30,490
Yes, that's what I thought.
All right. We'll meet you there.

431
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:32,413
What, what?!

432
00:54:32,414 --> 00:54:33,500
We'll meet Sam and
Donnie in fifteen minutes.

433
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:37,506
Holy shit! Who the fuck are you?!

434
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:39,987
This is fucking
Christian's girlfriend!

435
00:54:39,988 --> 00:54:42,944
Are you out of your fucking mind?
- What the fuck?!

436
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,288
What was I supposed to do?!

437
00:54:47,289 --> 00:54:51,785
What did you do to get that
revenge bitch to fucking chase you?!

438
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:54,440
And what do you know
about Tanja Campbell?!

439
00:54:54,441 --> 00:54:55,791
You fucking tell me now!

440
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:57,717
Sarah!

441
00:54:57,718 --> 00:55:01,795
Shut up!
- Sarah!!!

442
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:03,255
Get your hands off from me!

443
00:55:03,256 --> 00:55:04,059
Sarah!
- WHAT?!

444
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,010
Sit down!

445
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:10,266
It was an accident...
- What was a fucking accident?!

446
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:18,542
Tell us!
- Mike and I used to be lovers...

447
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:25,495
I do everything for
him... All right!

448
00:55:25,496 --> 00:55:30,384
Get to fucking Tanja
right now... just...

449
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:33,829
You don't fucking touch me!
You don't fucking know!

450
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:38,527
He cheated on me with Tanja.
There was a party at the lake.

451
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:46,474
...Tanja was there.
And I told Chris I wanted to scare her.

452
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:52,837
We got the gun out of
his car and waited for her.

453
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:58,584
Who do you think you are?!
Dirty bitch!

454
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:01,852
Who do you think YOU are?!

455
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:10,331
Dirty slut... you little piece of shit!

456
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:14,267
What should we do with you now?

457
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:18,066
She got away...
Do something! NOW!

458
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:26,211
Are you nuts?!

459
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:31,216
Is she dead?

460
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:39,890
The bitch was pregnant.
- You fucked her!

461
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:46,561
I thought my life was over!
Guys, haha... Is she dead?

462
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:48,900
Holy shit!
You just saved my life!

463
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:53,909
No one talks about it and everything's okay.
- Perfect!

464
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:58,914
Are you nuts?!

465
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:03,646
Anyways... it's daddy's turn now...
- Are you crazy? Kath killed her!

466
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:10,921
She's history now... It's daddy's job now...
- Damn.

467
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:14,657
I'll call him.
- Hey dad. It's me.

468
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:17,666
We really need your help here...
Okay, see you soon.

469
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:21,932
He's coming.
He'll take care of this.

470
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:31,947
You guys can go home now.
It's not your problem anymore.

471
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:39,284
Damn. Thanks.

472
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:44,286
Thanks a lot. Let's get a beer... now!

473
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:58,338
Hey, it's me. Change your plans.
We just found out where Tanja's body is.

474
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:03,739
Yeah. You know the old cabin by the lake?
Yeah, that's exactly what I thought.

475
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:13,979
Yes. We'll meet you there in twenty minutes.
And Sam... bring the salt.

476
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:43,644
I have a really bad feeling about this.

477
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:47,784
Sam...
I never should have brought Sarah to Germany.

478
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:55,027
This is much bigger than we thought.

479
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:05,063
Sam. Kathrin. Girlfriend of
Christian, who, by the way,

480
00:59:05,064 --> 00:59:07,104
just got ripped apart
by that revenge bitch.

481
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:10,584
I think Teppert and the others
are in some really big trouble,

482
00:59:10,585 --> 00:59:12,045
if they're not already dead.

483
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:22,046
What difference will four more make, huh?!
I'm ready to burn in hell!

484
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:28,586
Why did I confess all of that to you?
It was none of your business.

485
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:32,066
Kathrin...
- Why couldn't I take my own advice...

486
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:36,128
...and keep my stupid mouth shut?!

487
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:38,468
Kathrin... just give me the gun.

488
00:59:38,469 --> 00:59:42,075
You don't wanna kill anybody.
Just give me the gun!

489
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,812
Kathrin...
You don't wanna kill anybody. Just...

490
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:53,749
I didn't want to kill Tanja either,
but I did... didn't I?

491
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:58,116
I couldn't tell you the whole story...
because I didn't know it all...

492
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:02,825
...until now. There was someone else.

493
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:04,222
What?

494
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:07,427
Are you saying there's
someone else involved?

495
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:08,952
Just run away Kathrin.

496
01:00:08,953 --> 01:00:11,096
We won't tell anyone what happened.

497
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:14,402
Kathrin. Just put the gun down.

498
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:17,101
I know you don't
wanna shoot anybody.

499
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:22,117
I can't.
- Just put it down!

500
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:26,815
You're confused.
We just wanna help you.

501
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:32,127
I can't!
- Just put it down.

502
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:40,732
I CAN'T!

503
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:45,902
Holy shit!
- Fuck!

504
01:00:56,586 --> 01:01:01,285
Salt!

505
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:36,720
It was all Kathrin's fault!

506
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:41,521
Sarah! Get away from him!

507
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:15,839
Follow her to the States,
become friends with her,

508
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,996
and then bring her to
Germany... at any price!

509
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,723
She sent a sketch of Christian
via fax to my police station.

510
01:02:26,724 --> 01:02:27,999
I have to know what she knows!

511
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:32,907
I've got a really bad feeling about this.

512
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:38,379
Do what I want...
or I'll blame her death on you.

513
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:40,877
I didn't do anything!
That's none of my business!

514
01:02:40,878 --> 01:02:43,455
You gave me a call and said
that her death was an accident!

515
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:48,559
And now you know the truth.
So please... do what I want.

516
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:52,267
Get away from him.

517
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:06,372
Don't you wanna know who
really killed your sister?

518
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:10,343
I already know who
fucking killed my sister.

519
01:03:13,322 --> 01:03:18,885
There's more to that story.
Teppert paid me.

520
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:32,640
I didn't wanna hurt anybody.
- Fucking bitch!

521
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:42,750
I just realized what I got myself into.

522
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:02,326
Frank!

523
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:14,742
I thought it was an accident... not murder.
-You're a fucking liar!

524
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:24,450
What have you done?!
- Something I'll pay you to help me out of.

525
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:27,519
I... I can't believe this!
You're the police!

526
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:31,124
And I want to stay a policeman.

527
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:40,500
Mike is Teppert's...

528
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:42,373
...son!

529
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:48,144
Liar!
- I didn't wanna hurt anybody...

530
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:53,149
I just realized what I got myself into!

531
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:21,772
Man... my knees won't stop shaking.

532
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:24,836
It's just your knees... pussy.

533
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:31,111
Good job, fuckface.
- Yeah, shitball. What did you do?

534
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:16,861
Sarah.

535
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:56,335
Oh fuck...

536
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:07,145
It's okay. It's all over now.

537
01:08:10,886 --> 01:08:15,585
You're all right?
- Yes, I am.

538
01:08:23,632 --> 01:08:25,259
Let's go.

539
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:36,165
Fuck you... Fuck you!

540
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:43,677
Fuck that shit!

541
01:14:43,678 --> 01:14:44,678
