1
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,880
Come on, baby. It's lunch time.

2
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,120
Up we go.

3
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,040
Good Morning. Costello Real Estate.
How may I help you?

4
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,400
Mr. Costello's offiice.
Good morning.

5
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,680
You are not gonna believe
what just came up.

6
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,840
Eeny, meeny, miney-- Lucy.

7
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,040
How day, race fans.
How's it hangin'?

8
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,680
It's hangin'just fine, thanks.

9
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,000
The boss wants a word. It seems we have
a little domesticon our hands.

10
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,800
Can you stall for me?
I'm a little busy.

11
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,280
That's all right.
I'll set it up on-line.

12
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,240
God for bid you actually have to come out
of your hole and talk like a human.

13
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,720
It make some wonder what you all did
before computers, Detective.

14
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,640
Anyway, it's all very hush-hush.

15
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,360
I'm going to lay my money on Hugo brat
shacking up with yet another bimbo.

16
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,720
Very embarrassing.
National disgrace.

17
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,840
Sono cops, got it?
Speak of the devil...

18
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,880
here's Hugo.

19
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,920
Okay, we're about to go live.

20
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,240
- Hilary.
- Mr. Hugo, one moment, please.

21
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,080
Putting you through now, sir.
You fat fuck.

22
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,560
You're on-line.

23
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,120
- Morning.
-Sir.

24
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,880
A personal problem has developed to me
that l'd like you to take a look at.

25
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,680
- Yes, sir.
- Nothing serious, really.

26
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,920
Nothing that a good kick
in the pants wouldn't sort out.

27
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,000
The pants in question being worn
by my 22-year- old son Paul.

28
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,360
I suspect he's been stealing money
from a trust account.

29
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,840
I want you to find out
what he's up to.

30
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,200
Yes, sir.

31
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,080
Thank you. Good morning.

32
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,400
Good morning.

33
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,480
Beauty is in the eye
of the beholder.

34
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,320
Hil?

35
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,360
He walks. He talks.
He's alive!

36
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
I'll call you from the trenches.

37
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,280
Here, I got you something.

38
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,040
" Portland, Oregon."

39
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,160
- It's the same one as Cincinnati.
- Nonsense.

40
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,720
- It's the same buildings.
- It's not.

41
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,040
- Is too.
- It's not.

42
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,080
Do you always park in front
of fire hydrants, sir?

43
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,520
Yes.

44
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,000
Are you gonna stop parking
in front of fire hydrants?

45
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,840
- No.
- And why's that?

46
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,520
My apologies, sir.
You have a nice day, now.

47
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,920
Who is he?

48
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,840
Some embassy brat,
forged Daddy's signature.

49
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,840
He's making a cash withdrawal
for someone.

50
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,720
- And who is she?
- I don't know. We've never seen her.

51
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,680
I bet she's pretty.

52
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,320
I bet she's not.

53
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,840
- Which one?
- There.

54
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,320
- This one?
- No.

55
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,760
No? Not this one?

56
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,880
- The other one.
- Yes?

57
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,000
The guy behind him.

58
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,960
Not the bum.

59
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,040
God bless America.
Can you spare any change?

60
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,640
Anyone.
You got a dollar for me, please?

61
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,880
Please.
Please, help me out.

62
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
One, three, three, four.

63
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,440
Why don't you take
any pictures of me, Daddy?

64
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,600
Sweetheart, I never go anywhere
without your picture. You know that.

65
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,080
I mean other pictures.

66
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,200
Sure, I used to take lots.

67
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,320
Do you remember Sea World?
The dolphins and the clowns on skis.

68
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,320
Do you remember?
You were just a baby at the time.

69
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,560
No. Where are they?

70
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,680
Your mother has them, along with
everything else with your name on it.

71
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,920
At least she was there
when I got home from school.

72
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,640
She didn't spend her whole life
staring at dumb computer screens.

73
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,120
Lucy!

74
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,440
Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.

75
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,080
- Where's the money, Paul?
- What?

76
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,400
- The money.
- It's in my bag, safe and sound.

77
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,600
Good. This is nice, hmm?

78
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,120
Do you like it?
No body can see us for a million miles.

79
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,200
Ever brought any women here?

80
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,800
- I have been known to on occasion.
- I didn't think so.

81
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,760
I brought you.

82
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,480
I'm not other women.

83
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,240
- Pass memy Gitanes.
- Your what?

84
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,400
- Gitanes. Cigarettes.
- Gitanes cigarettes.

85
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,080
- What is this? A shark? A fish?
- Oh, no. It's a pisces.

86
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,400
a pisces! How '70s.
What, you actually into that crap?

87
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,600
-As a matter in fact, l am.
- Well, I'm a Leo.

88
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,200
Hey, what do you think of that?
A shark and a lion.

89
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,760
So do you--
So tell me.

90
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,360
Do you swim around
all day eating plankton...

91
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,800
or do you bite the heads
off little fish?

92
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,840
Oh, pisces are broad-minded,
artistic...

93
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,880
and sensitive.

94
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,600
We're also extremely selfish...

95
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,720
manic-depressive substance abusers.

96
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,840
All depends on what side
of the bed l get up on.

97
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,080
Don't forget about
who's in bed with you, huh?

98
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,240
- Wait.
- Wait? What? What?

99
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,920
- Now we're going to play a game.
-A game?

100
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,760
Baby!

101
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,080
What are you doing?

102
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,200
- Get down now.
- Down, yes. How?

103
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,920
- Get down on your knees.
- You kinky little--

104
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,600
I-- Oh!

105
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,920
Oh, my.

106
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,840
Oh, yes.

107
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,040
Where'd you go?
Come here.

108
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,520
Merry Christmas, Daddy!

109
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,040
Merry Christmas.

110
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,880
Fuck in' phone.

111
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,240
Don't leave her, Daddy.

112
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,160
She's just a little girl.

113
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,840
Don't leave her alone.

114
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,840
Do you want your change?

115
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,040
- Where's the phone.
- Out back, past the cash registers.

116
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,240
Oh, come on.

117
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,200
Do you have another phone?
It's an emergency.

118
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,720
- Do you have another phone?
- Nah.

119
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,880
Cash registers kept smash in them
to pieces look in' for quarters.

120
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,800
- Here. I owe you ten bucks.
- Come on. Come on!

121
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,360
I want to come home.
It's Christmas, for Christ's sake.

122
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,160
You don't really have to come home
any more, dear, do you?

123
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,520
You can e-mail me, or we can talk
on this thing you've given me.

124
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,040
I gotta go, Mother.
I'll call you back.

125
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,680
Hilary--

126
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,800
- You're in the pool.
- Hi, Hil.

127
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,680
Well, well, well. Lucky legs.
Nice to see your smiling face.

128
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,680
Love your work, let's do lunch
and when ever you're ready.

129
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,840
The eye which is reflected
to the external world...

130
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,160
is also the mirror
to the soul within.

131
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,640
I didn't, if you please.

132
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,240
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

133
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,520
I'm a little out of my depth here.
We're gonna have to call a breach 3.

134
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,520
I got a breach 3.

135
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,520
What the hell
are you doing on hard-line?

136
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,720
My cell phone and GPS went down.
I had an accident.

137
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,120
I'm running a trace.
Pittsburgh, correct?

138
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,400
- Correct, train station.
- Okay, got it.

139
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,240
- What do you need?
- State police, federal, who ever's near.

140
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,280
Suspect's about to board
a train to New York City...

141
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,480
and may be traveling
under the alias of--

142
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,640
- Lucy.
- Under the alias of?.

143
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,960
- Under the alias of?.
- Lucy?

144
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,400
Talk to me, Lucky.

145
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,280
Lucky?
Under the alias of?.

146
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,720
- Lucky, what's going on?
- Don't tell, don't tell, don't tell.

147
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,200
Detective! Wilson, what the
hell's going on out there?

148
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,160
- Wait a minute.
- What's happening?

149
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,720
- Wait a minute.
- Don't tell, don't tell, don't tell.

150
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,560
Look, you're wasting time here.
I'm sending in the troopers.

151
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,280
Don't leave her.
She's just a little girl.

152
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,200
- No, don't do that.
- Well, you have a breach 3.

153
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,200
Then suddenly you don't.
What's up? What's the matter?

154
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,880
Nothing, nothing.
I'll have to go. I'll call in.

155
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,480
- Lucky!
- Here we go again.

156
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,040
He's gotten a lot worse since
his wife and kid went away.

157
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,320
Well, why don'tyou stick your business
where the sun don't shine?

158
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,800
- How'd it go?
- Nothing.

159
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,800
No match, no fiingerprints.
Nothing.

160
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,560
- Is she real?
- She's real, all right. A real pro.

161
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,880
Acid wash would burn
her fiinger prints right off.

162
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,200
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Scotch, rocks with some bitters.

163
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,600
Thank you.

164
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,600
- Can I get you something to drink?
- I'll have a vodka and orange.

165
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,840
Happy New Year.

166
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,800
- Do you mind if l flirt with you?
- Seeing how timing is everything...

167
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,320
why don't you wait until
I'm done reading my stars?

168
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,320
Mickey Argyle.

169
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,120
- Dorothy Bishop.
- Pleasure.

170
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,800
Excuse me. I don't mean to interrupt,
but you're not from Cleveland, are you?

171
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,120
- No.
- Your name isn't Gail Fleming?

172
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,240
- No, it isn't.
- I'm sorry.

173
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,600
A friend from Cleveland used to go out
with a girl who looked just like--

174
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,880
But that was a while back.

175
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,800
I have never been to Cleveland,
and everybody looks like somebody else.

176
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,840
I'll drink to that, toots.

177
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,000
Excuse me.

178
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,080
Excuse me.

179
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,920
May I please have my cognac?
I've been waiting 20 minutes.

180
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,120
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

181
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,560
Would you mind, please, sir?
The cognac?

182
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,000
So she says to me...

183
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,560
it's her or the jewels.

184
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,000
I chose to keep the jewels.

185
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,280
My jewels.

186
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,560
You know, you have beautiful eyes.

187
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,320
Unalloyed, unblemished black opal.

188
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,720
Almost perfect.

189
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,480
An expert. How fortunate.

190
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,560
Absolutely-tutely.

191
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,480
Voila.

192
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,720
Impressive.

193
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,920
Larry!

194
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,600
My mink was right here.
Oh, my God.

195
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,920
Somebody has taken my mink coat!

196
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,440
Very nice.

197
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,040
And this opal would retail
for approximately what?

198
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,480
- Five thousand.
- pisces.

199
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,480
- Could you give me possibly--
- It's all in the hands of the gods.

200
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,280
Maybe we should have a couple of kids.
What do you think?

201
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,280
Lay off me. Please?

202
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,680
Hey, lady, I think
it's time you went home.

203
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,400
Merry Christmas, Daddy.

204
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,200
Merry fucking Christmas.

205
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,600
I wish you bluebirds

206
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,520
In the spring

207
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,960
To give your heart a song to sing

208
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,120
- Lucy.
- And then a kiss

209
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,240
But more than this

210
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,080
I wish you love

211
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,080
And in July

212
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,640
A lemonade to cool you with

213
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,080
- Lucy, be quiet.
- Some leaf you glade

214
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,400
I wish you health

215
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,880
But more than wealth

216
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,120
I wish you love

217
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,160
- My breaking heart
- Stop sing--

218
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,640
And l agree

219
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,320
That you and l

220
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,880
Could never be

221
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,600
So with my best
My very best

222
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,240
I set you free

223
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,800
- I wish you--
- Lucy, be quiet!

224
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,680
I'm sorry.

225
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,160
I wish you health

226
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,400
But more than wealth

227
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,240
I wish you

228
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,520
I wish you bluebirds in the spring

229
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,120
Harry, can't you read the sign
that says "no pets"?

230
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,960
- This place doesn't allow gold fish.
- They don't make noise.

231
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,240
Debra.
A gentle reminder, darling.

232
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,640
Take out your own trash
on Tuesday and Thursday.

233
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,800
- Of course.
- And don't throw it in the street.

234
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,760
Throw it in a bin.

235
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,600
- Tell your boy friend to do the same.
- Which one?

236
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,720
The one who's been
following you around all week.

237
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,960
You know the one.
The one who waits outside for you...

238
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,600
and follows you around
like a lost dog.

239
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,200
- You know.
- Describe him.

240
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,720
Oh, so-so.
Average height.

241
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,320
Normal looking.

242
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,280
At my age,
they all look the same.

243
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,320
Have a nice day.

244
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,320
Yo, taxi!

245
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,840
Hey, hold up!

246
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,360
Yo, babe.

247
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,080
- Come on. Don't be so antisocial.
- You gotta give me some of that.

248
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,240
- Nuts!
- You ain't gettin' none of that.

249
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,520
How the fuck did you get in here?

250
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,840
Guy down stairs gave me the key.

251
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,760
Your name Debra Yates?

252
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,080
Detective Crocker, NYPD.

253
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,280
What can I do for you, Detective?

254
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,640
You, uh...

255
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,080
dropped your pisces.

256
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,440
- I've never seen it before.
- Oh, yes, you have.

257
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,720
The guy down stairs says
you're from SaltLake City.

258
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,120
That's right.

259
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,000
Isn't it against the law to walk away
from the scene of an accident...

260
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,960
in Salt Lake City?

261
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,080
It's against the law
here in New York.

262
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,120
What can I do for you, Detective?

263
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,600
Come again?

264
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,760
How much is this gonna cost me?

265
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,560
- Are you bribing me?
- Yes, I am.

266
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,040
How much?

267
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:34,600
Okay. A thousand dollars
and a shot of some of that...

268
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,760
whatever it is.

269
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,200
It's cognac.

270
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,280
- What do you do for a living?
- I'm a wigmaker.

271
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,200
I'm here drumming up some business.

272
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,640
You sure you got
a thousand dollars?

273
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,160
No.

274
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,640
But I'm sure we can come to
some kind of an arrangement.

275
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,720
I'm sure you're right.

276
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,000
Don't touch that.

277
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,040
Lady, can I get that for you?

278
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,680
Sir. Sir!

279
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,720
Taxi!

280
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,240
I'm tired, Daddy.
I want to go home.

281
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,880
Soon, sweetheart.

282
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,040
What are we doing here?
It's late.

283
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,560
I'm sorry, baby.
We can't go yet.

284
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,800
Not yet.
If l blink, I might lose her.

285
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,960
So?

286
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,000
So the last time I blinked,
I lost you...

287
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,680
I lost my wife
and I nearly lost my mind.

288
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,680
I can't lose her.

289
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,760
I'll be with you in a minute,
ma'am.

290
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,840
Sorry about the wait. Your brandy,
sir. That's six dollars, please.

291
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,760
Oh, thank you.
Here you are.

292
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,160
- I'm sorry, sir. That's a five.
- Pardon?

293
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,440
No, isn't.
It's a ten, you snake.

294
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,160
Oh, gosh, so it is.

295
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,240
Your drink, sir.

296
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,720
- And your change.
- Keep the change.

297
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,600
Thank you very much.

298
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,400
Happens all the time.

299
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,040
Waiters, taxi drivers, they all
try it on. I find it quite amusing.

300
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,720
You see, I can tell the difference
between a five and a ten.

301
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,000
- How?
- I fold them differently.

302
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,000
Short for a five
and long for a ten.

303
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,360
Cheers.

304
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,360
What are you reading?

305
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,760
Numerology.

306
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,360
Are you amateur or a professional?

307
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,760
Oh, I might be
professional someday.

308
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,240
- When were you born, Mr.--
- Leonard.

309
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,240
Alexander Leonard.

310
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,320
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

311
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,080
Vincent, Charlotte.

312
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,960
How do you do?

313
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,320
So, the fox in the mink?
Cool as a cucumber.

314
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,240
She's gonna take the poor bastard
for everything he's got.

315
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,160
Well, that's my flight, Charlotte.

316
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,800
Thanks again.

317
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,760
It's my flight too.

318
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,240
- Oh.
- May I give you a hand?

319
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,720
You want to help me?

320
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,080
What's the procedure?

321
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:28,480
Very well.
I take your arm and you lead.

322
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,000
Your heart is beating so fast.
Why is that?

323
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,280
Oh, I was a little nervous...

324
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,560
that someone might
show up at the airport.

325
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,320
Oh, don't worry.
On the arms of a blind man...

326
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,680
is the safest place for
a beautiful woman to be.

327
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,080
Sir, sir!
You forgot this!

328
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,440
The eye which is reflected
to the external world...

329
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,000
is also the mirror
to the soul within.

330
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,720
- I didn't.
- Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

331
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,640
Where the hell have you been?
You go shitting through a tea towel.

332
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,560
- You've got to speak to the boss.
- Stall for me.

333
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:37,000
Look, tell him Paul Hugo now goes
under the name of Barry Grible.

334
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,560
He spent a week in Montreal, and then
he went to Seattle with a girl.

335
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,080
He's on his way to Rome now. I'm on him,
but the plane's about to board.

336
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,600
I'm gonna send you a sample, Hil.

337
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,000
I want you to run
a fulI DNA test on it for me.

338
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,960
- It's a pubic hair.
- Not until you tell me what's going on.

339
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,680
Nothing's going on.
I'm close, that's all.

340
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,960
Don't do this. I'm not putting
my ass on the line again.

341
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,360
Look, this is not about the kid.
Hilary, look, this is legit.

342
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,160
Hil. Hilary.

343
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,600
- You son of a bitch.
- That's my girl.

344
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,360
So I'll send this to you today.
It should reach you by Thursday.

345
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,840
I have to go, Hil.

346
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,080
Well, well, what is this?

347
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,560
Mr. Leonard.

348
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:11,040
I tell you, it wasn't me.
I don't know what you're talking about.

349
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,480
Even so, it's lovely.
Step.

350
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,600
Here, let me feel it.

351
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,480
- Is that it? lt's a mere trinket.
- It's very sweet.

352
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,080
- I have a much bigger surprise for you.
- Oh, my.

353
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,960
An old friend passed away
leaving me with this eyesore...

354
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,320
and l've been scratching my head
wondering what to do with it.

355
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,120
And what do you
intend to do with it?

356
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,720
Do you want to bean
amateur all your life?

357
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,080
What can l say?
It's fantastic.

358
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,920
So do we consider
ourselves partners?

359
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,000
If you insist.

360
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:10,560
Like I said, if you like her so much,
why don't you talk to her?

361
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,960
- I don't talk to anyone.
- You talk to me.

362
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,600
- You're not real.
- Oops. Time.

363
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,120
He loves her...

364
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,880
and he's going to
take her away from you.

365
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,120
Not if she does him in first.

366
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,400
You're jealous, Daddy.

367
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,240
And you're not!

368
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,480
I here by declare Charlotte's den
of astrology and numerology...

369
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,880
offiicially open.

370
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,960
- Did I get it, darling?
- It was perfect.

371
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,840
Okay, this is it. This is the last
l can do. Then you fill the report.

372
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,400
So it looks like your
sweet little hair came through.

373
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,560
- What?
- The DNA test.

374
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,840
She's got a record.

375
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,120
- When did this come through?
- Yesterday.

376
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,360
- Yesterday?
- Hey, I'm on the line as it is.

377
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,600
- So cut the crap.
- I'm sorry.

378
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,760
Just pipe this one through.

379
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,640
I'll wrap it up and owe you my life.
Just name your price.

380
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,640
That's more like it.
Thank you.

381
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,760
Okay, so here comes.

382
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,880
- There. How'd you go?
- Oh, Hil, marry me.

383
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,840
I'll need everything you've got
on this probation report.

384
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,400
Was that aproposal that l heard
just pass through your lips?

385
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,400
Next of kin.

386
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,160
Joanna Eris.

387
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,760
- Charlotte.
- Good morning, Mr. Leonard.

388
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,160
- You're early as usual.
- Good morning to you, Miss Vincent.

389
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,200
Now are you ready to be dazzled
by my fine wines?

390
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,160
I can hardly wait.
Dazzle away.

391
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,840
You're leaving.

392
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,720
- I'll be back in a few days.
- No, you're not.

393
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,120
You're leaving me again,
just like last time.

394
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,320
I didn't leave anybody.
Your mother left me.

395
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,200
Then take me with you.

396
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,080
No, I can't.
It's too important.

397
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,000
You're running away again.

398
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,160
- I'm not running away.
- Me and Mommy, you hate us.

399
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,200
- Oh, for God's sake.
- You're abandoning me.

400
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,080
I didn't abandon anyone!

401
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,480
She took you away from me.

402
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,360
She took everything away from me.

403
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,000
If you don't take me with you,
I won't ever come back.

404
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,360
I have to go.

405
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,640
Dreams of striking gold.

406
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,840
But, of course, that didn't happen.

407
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:47,000
The fact was, he was a loser.

408
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:51,040
Probably the most adorable loser
to ever walk the face of the Earth.

409
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,960
So Mom left.

410
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,280
In December, a guy came and...

411
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,640
had the power shut off.

412
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,760
I was nine years old.
It was Christmas.

413
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,200
We went for a walk...

414
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,200
roaming the streets like
a couple of homeless people...

415
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,280
watching others shop,
looking at the lights.

416
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,880
He sang to me.

417
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,760
I wish you bluebirds in the spring

418
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,800
We sat some where
to rest for a while.

419
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,680
I wasn't stupid.
I knew l was gonna see Christmas...

420
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,640
from the back alley
of a shoe store.

421
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,440
But still, I was totally
caught up in spirit of things.

422
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,400
I wanted to get him something,
give him some thing special.

423
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,080
But when l got back...

424
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,280
he was gone.

425
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,560
It was Christmas Day.

426
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,600
I never saw my daddy again.

427
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,840
I never saw him again.

428
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,440
I never saw my daddy again.

429
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,400
I'll always be here.
I love you.

430
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,600
I love you.

431
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,520
I love you, Charlotte.

432
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,640
Don't leave her.

433
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,760
Don't leave her alone.

434
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,960
First we are processed.

435
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,320
First we are processed.

436
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,600
They take everything away.

437
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,160
We lose our personal possessions.

438
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,920
Everything except our own shoes.

439
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,400
They want us to wear
our own shoes...

440
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,880
just to feel a little bit at home.

441
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,760
Then we make ourway
out into the yard...

442
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,840
where we will meet
our fellow in mates...

443
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,360
and the first thing
they're going to do?

444
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,640
They're going to take our shoes.

445
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,720
So, come on then.

446
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,640
Take off your shoes.

447
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,840
I mean it.
Take off your shoes.

448
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,280
Take off your shoes!

449
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,920
- Dr. Brault.
- Can I help you?

450
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,640
You were in charge of the probation
exchange scheme during the early '80s?

451
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,760
If you would contact my offiice--

452
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,840
I'm investigating a former resident.
Could you spare me a few moments?

453
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,120
Who are you investigating?

454
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,680
Eris,Joanna.

455
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,080
- Cognac?
- Please.

456
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,240
She did fine with the foster homes.

457
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,360
The theft was nothing more than
a youthful dare-- there you go--

458
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,800
that certainly didn't amount
to 12 months' detention.

459
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,440
That's where the real damage
was done.

460
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,440
She tried to kill herself
several times.

461
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,800
Stuck her hand right through
a plate glass window...

462
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,480
and attempted to hack it off.

463
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,440
Did you know that?

464
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,440
Cigarette?

465
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,920
And after her release
she came straight to you.

466
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,600
They all came to me.

467
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,680
I was federal probation chief
at the time.

468
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,480
The whole exchange program
was my idea.

469
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,200
Remove the girls from
their familiar environments...

470
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:28,720
unearth them, probate them
where they had no roots.

471
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,000
Well, it didn't work.
It just didn't work.

472
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:36,360
After a couple of years
it became a very costly blur.

473
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,480
The girls were all unmanageable...

474
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:42,240
ignorant, demented female hoods.

475
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,320
All, that is, but...

476
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:47,160
Joanna, number 8773.

477
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,920
Joanna Eris.

478
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,040
She was unique. I had her
immediately transferred to Boston.

479
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,040
- For your own personal supervision.
- Mm-hmm.

480
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,120
Forgive me for asking,
Dr. Brault.

481
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,880
Are you wearing a wig?

482
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,720
Does she still wear wigs?

483
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,880
One of the little tricks
I taught her.

484
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,480
Never reveal yourself to any man
who doesn't need to know.

485
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,320
Now you need to know.

486
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,440
And what other little tricks
did you teach her?

487
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:32,960
I taught her to survive, to fight
and never let the mother fuckers in.

488
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,040
Survival of the fittest,Joanna.

489
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,080
Kill or be killed.

490
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,920
Was she ever
sexually molested by a man?

491
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,280
- Not to my knowledge.
- Were you?

492
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,960
All right. That's enough.
Get out.

493
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,880
- Detective, my ass. Who are you?
- Miss Eris is in a lot of trouble.

494
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,840
- I'm someone that's trying to help.
- What?

495
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,800
To find out where
the trouble started?

496
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,200
Now you think you've got
a pretty good idea, is that it?

497
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,440
Who the hell do you people
think you are?

498
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,000
This girl came to me a weak,
pathetic little field mouse.

499
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,720
You hand me the problems,
never the solutions. Get out.

500
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,120
-Jan?
- Yes. Come on in, girls.

501
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,120
God bless you for your time, Doctor.
Keep up the good work.

502
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,760
- Get out. What is it?
- Are you all right?

503
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,560
Of course.
Of course I'm all right.

504
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:54,320
pisces.
familiarity breeds contempt.

505
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,200
Time to end the holiday
and get back to work...

506
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,400
remembering to tie up all
loose ends before you move on.

507
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,720
Your search is far from over...

508
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,360
as your true companion still
waits patiently in the wings.

509
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,360
Oh, no, no, no.

510
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,720
Why don't you just take out
a fucking advertisement?

511
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,360
I've always wondered what it took to
contain a large family, and now I know.

512
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,280
Stamina.

513
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:50,000
- I'm exhausted.
- That's just one side of the family.

514
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:54,200
- Look!
- I never look. What is it?

515
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:59,320
It's a skunk. That's about the best
sign of good luck you'll ever have.

516
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,880
Only when the stars are right
and the moon is full.

517
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,800
How's the moon?

518
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,640
It's full as a bull, old-timer.

519
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,240
So how will we celebrate
our good fortune?

520
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,880
A simple ceremony...

521
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,800
here or St. Boniface.

522
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:33,120
Nothing too elaborate.
Quaint and charming...

523
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,200
for, say...

524
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,240
800 of your closest friends.

525
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,000
Now, call me old-fashioned, but...

526
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,040
isn't it I who should
pop that question?

527
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,120
Well, technically, yes.

528
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,960
But why would you think
a lovely young thing such as myself...

529
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,400
would want to tie the knot
with a blind old coot...

530
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,720
who's rapidly approaching
his "use by" date.

531
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,200
Not to mention the fact that
you're a Virgo, Mr. Leonard...

532
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,840
and I know you better
than you know yourself.

533
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,120
And ofcourse, there's always
your fortune that I'm after.

534
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,480
Why, Charlotte?
Why me?

535
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,760
Because you can't see
who I really am...

536
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,920
and I think it's in the stars.

537
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,600
Very well, Miss Vincent.

538
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,520
I do.

539
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,000
Until tomorrow, then, my darling.

540
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,960
I love you, Mr. Leonard.

541
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:00,920
You know, I never did
buy you that pendant.

542
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,400
Of course you didn't.

543
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,440
Take care of her, Roy.

544
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,240
I know you're there.

545
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,400
What do you want?

546
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,160
Open your eyes,
you stupid blind bastard!

547
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,720
She's gonna kill ya!
She's gonna kill ya!

548
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,560
Come on!
I'm taking you away!

549
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,560
What are you doing here?
It's early.

550
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,200
Come on!
We're gonna get married!

551
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,240
- What?
- We're gonna get married!

552
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,880
Now?

553
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,560
Mr. Leonard, I think I have
something to tell you.

554
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,280
Congratulations.

555
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,280
You're kidding me.

556
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:52,320
That's fantastic.
I'm gonna be a father?

557
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,000
Congratulations, Daddy.

558
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,360
Stop.
Please stop.

559
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,840
Stop. Stop.

560
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,360
Please fucking stop.

561
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,840
Everybody stay back.

562
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,800
Back!

563
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,560
Let me go!

564
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:38,480
Get off me!
Get off of me!

565
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,840
Yea, though I walk through the valley
the shadow of death...

566
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:08,360
I will fear no evil...

567
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,320
for He is with me.

568
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:57,880
Looks like your cigarette lighter's
run out of gas, princess.

569
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,840
Hey, how are you?

570
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,960
- How are you?
- A little car trouble. Can you help me?

571
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,280
I sure think we can
take care of that.

572
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,440
I'm sure every man and his dog
has tried a line on you.

573
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,840
Has anyone ever told you
you have very sad eyes?

574
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,800
Yes, they have, Gary.

575
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,360
Has anyone ever told you
you need a shower?

576
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,240
That's a pretty mean-looking shark
you got there, princess.

577
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:01,000
It's a fiish. pisces.

578
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,920
Looks like a shark to me.

579
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,120
You like sharks?

580
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,040
I like the myths.

581
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,160
They have a limited memory.

582
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,120
Maybe only a minute or two.

583
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,000
Sounds like a pretty good life to me.

584
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,840
Ofcourse, the down side is...

585
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,160
they can never stop swimming.

586
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,960
Even when they're asleep...

587
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,000
they have to keep moving forward.

588
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,000
because if they stop
for even a moment...

589
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,960
they'll die.

590
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:59,120
- Fuck me dead.
- What?

591
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:04,120
Nothing. I was just--

592
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,760
I was just saying you could lay
your dentures on my bed side table...

593
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,080
any day of the week, princess.

594
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:13,720
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing.

595
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,240
Forget it.

596
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,080
Stupid bitch.

597
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,320
What are you doing
in there, princess?

598
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,200
You haven't started without me,
have you?

599
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,000
Princess is in the middle
of her ablutions.

600
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,120
Fuckwad.

601
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:35,480
I wish you bluebirds in the spring

602
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:55,360
A little surprise on the dresser
near your purse, princess.

603
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,440
Just for you.

604
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,520
A little dart action, you know?

605
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:02,360
You see, there's this bar just off
the one-five out of Baker...

606
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,120
where they have these
English dart champion ships.

607
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,080
And there's this guy.
And I bend over...

608
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,360
to pick up his girl friend
who's sprawled on the floor...

609
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,080
completely fucking smashed...

610
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:14,280
and the fucker hits me in the ass
with this yellow feather weight dart...

611
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:16,240
right between the cheeks.

612
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,000
Can you believe it?

613
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:25,560
So what do I do?
I nail him to the bar...

614
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:28,240
and use his head
for a fucking dart competition.

615
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:30,240
What's all this stuff?

616
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:33,000
That's just a little something
to get the evening started, darling.

617
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,320
Thanks. I'll pass.

618
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:38,680
No. No, don't.
It's just for fun.

619
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,760
I don't want to have to blast alone.

620
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,520
It's not my thing.
You go right ahead. I'll watch.

621
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,280
You'll fucking watch?

622
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,920
Ladies and gentlemen...

623
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:00,840
step right up
and watch the freak show...

624
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,200
and see for the first time
in this country the amazing pin cushion!

625
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:11,200
Treat yourself, folks.

626
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:14,240
treat yourself and watch
the bearded lady...

627
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,960
cut herself to ribbons.

628
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,880
Come on, baby.

629
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,960
Baby fell down.

630
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,800
That's a good baby.

631
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,880
Here we go.

632
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,920
Welcome to heaven, princess.

633
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:33,200
No milk today, thanks.

634
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,320
Thankyou!

635
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:43,600
Now piss off and mind
your own fucking business!

636
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,400
Yes?

637
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:53,480
Don't leave her.

638
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,800
She's just a little girl.
Don't leave her alone.

639
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:01,280
I'll never ever leave her.

640
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,080
Ever.

641
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:07,040
Cross my heart.

642
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,920
Hope to die?

643
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,880
Forever and ever.

644
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,080
Amen.

645
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,320
What the fuck is this?

646
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:48,200
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck?

647
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,800
Get me the fuck out of here.

648
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,920
Motherfucker!

649
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,480
Fuck it!

650
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:07,880
- The car! Where's the fucking car?
- Morning there, partner.

651
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:11,680
Sound like you had
a little fun last night.

652
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,320
Where is she?
I said, where is she?

653
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,840
She went north
about a half hour ago.

654
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,320
You gonna pay for them rooms?

655
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,640
- Hil, honey?
- Yeah.

656
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:48,080
We've got our lost dog.
Better late than never.

657
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:52,840
Christ.

658
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,880
I've got two guys in Boston
pulling the place apart.

659
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:57,880
What the hell are you doing
in Utah?

660
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,880
I've lost the Hugo kid, Hil,
and l need some help.

661
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,720
- Could you put an ASU out on all--
- We've been trying to tell you.

662
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:07,320
Hugo and his wife bought it
in a car accident a month ago.

663
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:10,880
So it's finished. It's over.
You're coming home.

664
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,040
The boss is dead.

665
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,280
Jesus, I've been worried sick.
How the hell are you surviving?

666
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,080
You know me. Lucky legs.

667
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,840
Could you put an ASU out
on all hospitals for me?

668
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,360
A woman may try to register
under the name--

669
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,920
For God's sake, listen to me.

670
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,320
Listen.

671
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:29,280
Hugo had ended the whole case
over to the Feds months ago.

672
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:32,840
So it's over. You're coming home,
and that's an order.

673
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,040
Will you do
one last thing for me?

674
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:37,840
I'm not authorized to.

675
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:41,160
Fuck authorization, Hil.
I'm in trouble here.

676
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:45,840
A woman may try and register into
hospital under the name Eris or Leonard.

677
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:49,320
This is an emergency, and the last thing
l need no ware the fucking Feds.

678
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:51,480
Will you help me, please?

679
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:56,440
Look, I can't fuck
this one up as well.

680
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,080
Please.

681
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,880
I'll see what I can do.

682
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,040
Hello, there.

683
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:39,040
Hello. Yoo-hoo.

684
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,040
Hello.

685
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,040
- Pardon?
- May I help you?

686
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,440
Yes.

687
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:49,920
I've just flown in to visit
a friend of mine, miss Joanna Eris.

688
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,840
Oh, good!

689
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:55,280
I'm so glad somebody came,
it being Christmas and everything.

690
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,440
She's down the hall in 36...

691
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:59,480
although she's probably
asleep by now.

692
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,480
You know she lost the baby, don'tyou?

693
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,440
Who was he?

694
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,480
He didn't say, dear.

695
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,440
But he asked for me by name?
He said Joanna Eris?

696
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:11,440
Yes.
He said he was a friend.

697
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:14,760
- What did he look like?
- Like a sales man.

698
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,080
They all look the same to me--

699
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:20,440
sales men, reporters, photographers.

700
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:24,480
They get your names from the registry
and come to sell baby products.

701
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:59,360
That's a roger.
Will wait till further notice.

702
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:01,280
Standing by.

703
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:21,920
Got any change?

704
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,480
Come on!
Fucking come on! Come on!

705
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:03,680
Buddy, you got a buck?

706
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,080
Miss Eris?

707
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:21,840
Federal police.

708
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:24,360
Would you mind coming
with us, please?

709
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:29,920
- Why?
- We'll explain in the car.

710
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,280
In the car, please.

711
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,080
Two, three.

712
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,240
Morning, Nellie.

713
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,760
- I'm ready when you are, darling.
- Get over it, pal.

714
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,720
It's not gonna happen.

715
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:10,440
I'd like the omelet
with herbs, please.

716
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:13,040
- The what?
- Omelet with herbs.

717
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:15,360
You shouldn't have to ask, Nell.

718
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:18,440
We're gonna install a bed here for him.
How are you, Frank?

719
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,680
- I'm good, Lizzie.
- Good.

720
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,360
So you come in a lot?

721
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,480
Last couple of weeks. You?
Have you been here long?

722
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:28,320
I don't know.
Couple months.

723
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:30,080
Side dishes?

724
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:36,160
- Taurus?
- Yeah.

725
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,840
- Do you believe in the stars?
- Not anymore.

726
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,440
pisces reads...

727
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,880
"It may seem you have reached
the end of your road...

728
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,080
but all is about to change.

729
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:48,640
The sacrifiice you are about to make
will become another's salvation."

730
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,720
And then it says,
"You will never be forgotten."

731
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:55,880
- Do you want some coffee?
- Yes, please.

732
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:12,800
I'm bust in at the seams, Frank.

733
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,880
You don't mind sharing, do you?

734
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:36,920
All done, gentlemen?

735
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:38,880
- Who gets the check?
- I got it.

736
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,080
Coffee?

737
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:51,880
- What do you think?
- Can't say for sure.

738
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:55,920
- Worth a try, though.
- Yeah.

739
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:11,080
Fucking cops.

740
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:12,680
What about them?

741
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,880
You can always spot them.

742
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,440
Didn't notice.

743
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:19,040
I don't know what time you're finished,
but I'm coming back later...

744
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:23,480
and I wondered if may be
you would want a drink.

745
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,880
I'm working a double.
Thanks.

746
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:26,080
Watch the alarm.
Raccoons keep setting them off...

747
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:30,440
and I sure ain't coming down here
at 4:00 a.m. to reason with them again.

748
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:32,480
Night-night.

749
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,840
Night, Frank.

750
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,440
I said, night, Frank.

751
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:41,360
Night, Lizzie.

752
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:53,040
I'm in real estate in the valley.

753
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:55,840
That's why I can help you
get a house.

754
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:58,440
Getting a house isn't a problem.

755
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,360
It's easy enough.

756
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:03,680
What do you do in a house...

757
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,880
when you wake up in it?

758
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:12,480
What do you do on Christmas...

759
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:14,480
in a house?

760
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,440
I'm supposed to be so...

761
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:23,040
young, and not have anything
to show for myself...

762
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:25,080
except a big sense of loss.

763
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,880
That hardly fills up a house.

764
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,200
What have you lost?

765
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,840
I've lost my childhood...

766
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,360
my youth...

767
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,480
my father...

768
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:50,880
my husband...

769
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,720
my daughter.

770
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:03,640
She wasn't any bigger than a minute.

771
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:05,480
Barely had a name.

772
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:09,200
Now my mind's going too.
It plays tricks on me.

773
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:13,480
And spookiest of all,
I lost my angel.

774
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:20,280
I had a guardian
who looked after me.

775
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:24,840
I think I miss him most.

776
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,880
My angel.

777
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,480
Maybe he'll come back someday.

778
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:39,480
Come back and bury me
in my favorite grave yard in Valdez.

779
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:45,160
It's not up to us, though.

780
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,360
Is it?
It's up to the gods.

781
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:50,360
The whole thing is.

782
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:54,480
What have you lost?

783
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:57,680
It's only fair.

784
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:13,680
This one's my daughter...

785
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:16,200
I think.

786
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,680
She was an embassy kid
and was relocated--

787
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:25,080
or dislocated is, I think,
the word that they used--

788
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:27,080
every ten months.

789
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:33,480
I simply came home one day
and she wasn't there anymore.

790
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:38,080
And seven years later,
I stopped looking for her.

791
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:44,480
The thing that gets me the most
is that she had no choice.

792
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:46,880
She simply woke up one morning...

793
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:49,880
and didn't have a father anymore.

794
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:56,080
So I'm just a daddy
who lost his little girl.

795
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,440
And I guess you're a little girl...

796
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:01,480
who lost her daddy.

797
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,480
And that's it.

798
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:11,880
End of story.

799
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:59,360
Romeo, we're real crowded today.
You're gonna have to share.

800
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,480
What can I get you?

801
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,480
Coffee.

802
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:17,280
That's it?

803
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:45,440
For the record, Lieutenant,
I think this is a very sick scenario.

804
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:47,520
Nobody's accusing
anybody yet, Doctor.

805
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:49,520
Just tell us what you see.

806
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:51,680
Okay. Here we go.

807
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:58,120
That's not Joanna Eris.

808
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:01,680
We have reason to believe it is.
Be very sure.

809
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:04,000
I'm telling you, it's not her.

810
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:27,200
I'd really like
a chance to try again.

811
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:29,560
And I wouldn't waste your time.

812
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,600
I'd make it worth your while.

813
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:35,840
It's not a waste of my time.
It's a waste of your time.

814
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:40,920
I don't know how much more
of this place I can take.

815
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:44,280
- I get off in two hours.
- I can't wait.

816
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:47,560
I could drive the car around the back
and we could go now.

817
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,920
I'll meet you out back
in fiive minutes.

818
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,560
Come on, come on, come on.

819
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:44,120
Have a seat.

820
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:01,320
What did you say you do?

821
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:03,320
Real estate.

822
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:06,400
It's a pretty tough business up here.

823
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:11,040
It's a pretty mean business.

824
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:13,720
Snow means money,
and I'm suspicious.

825
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:16,600
I think that's why
I spotted the police so quickly.

826
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:20,560
I think they had the place staked.

827
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,560
I wonder what for.

828
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:27,440
They're probably gonna arrest somebody.
Probably one of the regulars...

829
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,360
or one of the staff.

830
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:33,680
Would you like a drink?
I only have cognac.

831
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:37,440
I never touch the stuff.

832
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,600
I've seen you someplace before.

833
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,800
I don't think so.

834
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:47,480
I've been around
a long time, though.

835
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:53,120
Someplace else.

836
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:56,760
Have you ever been to Florida?

837
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,040
Couple of times.

838
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:01,920
Everybody looks like
somebody else, huh?

839
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,360
Mywife was born in L.A.--

840
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:14,000
What are you doing?

841
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:27,360
Don't do this to me.

842
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:11,240
Come on!
Come on! Come on!

843
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:25,760
I know who you are.

844
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:29,320
You took my picture...

845
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,280
at the museum.

846
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,200
I wish you love.
