1
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,800
<i>Five minutes.</i>

2
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,000
Where's Frank?

3
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,000
You've got yourself a friend.

4
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,200
Bets are over.

5
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,700
He's a handycap.
This one's missing a leg.

6
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,338
I'm going for two on red.

7
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:57,699
Too late, Frank, the
runners are on the track

8
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:02,500
- Well give it back.
- Sorry, Frank, you owe the bank.

9
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,000
- Transfer?
- I'm out, Frank.

10
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,700
Just like that?

11
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,100
Alright.

12
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,500
Where's Hedge?

13
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,800
You don't see him?
He's out the door.

14
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,500
- Is he?
- You're next Lenny.

15
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,800
They were soft on him, things
will look good for you.

16
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,600
It's not likely they're going to split up
such a formiddable partnership, now is it?

17
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,599
Drake!

18
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,900
Get your fucking hands off me!

19
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,300
Hedges!

20
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,300
Catwalk!

21
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,700
Hello, brother.

22
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,500
Come on, let's get them.
- You smoked.

23
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,599
Give me one. Come on.
You have them all.

24
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,000
Someone takes care of you.
- Of course not.

25
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,400
Are you sure?
- Yes, I want one of them pussies.

26
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,900
Come on, come on.
Give me one.

27
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,400
Pussies!

28
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,799
Hey, you!
Look good to me!

29
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,800
The next time I see you
stand with your face against the wall!

30
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,900
- Against the wall, yeah!
- You bet.

31
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,100
Pussies! Pussies! Pussies!

32
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,500
Pussies! Pussies! Pussies!

33
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:52,000
This is your cell. This is your bunk.
This is your cellmate.

34
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,500
James Lacey.

35
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,800
Perry, mail.

36
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,500
Frank Perry
Prisoner Number 23401

37
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,700
Stare at someone else.

38
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,500
<i>Thinking about me Muschi</i>

39
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,600
<i>I know you are.</i>

40
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,100
<i>Prisoner 24484 Brodie, absent from Cell</i>

41
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,100
<i>Prisoner 27103 Lacey, absent from Cell</i>

42
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,600
<i>Prisoner 23410 Perry, to your cell!
- Prisoner 26432 Drake absent from Cell</i>

43
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,500
<i>Prisoner 135 Batista, absent from Cell</i>

44
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,300
You come at the wrong time,
chapel is closed.

45
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,200
Perry!

46
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,700
Well..

47
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,100
It's been a wee while.

48
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,400
I'll be right outside.

49
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,100
This is very hard.

50
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,200
But..

51
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,300
I'v got something I have to say to her.

52
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,200
It's nearly time, Batista.

53
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,600
Book!

54
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,300
Book.

55
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
Magazine.

56
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,100
Give me a card.

57
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,900
Come on, I want a card, Batista.

58
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,900
Just give me one.

59
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,099
Just give it to me!

60
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,400
Go beg your brother.

61
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,000
Do you get to wait awhile.

62
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,538
He's getting cocky, Rizzi!
he's laughing at me!

63
00:18:42,551 --> 00:18:45,000
You know he does it, you
know he fucking does it!

64
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,700
Get out.
You heard me, now get out.

65
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,000
Batista!

66
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,000
Come with me.

67
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,100
Your choice.

68
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,799
Tony said it was..

69
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,100
Tony..

70
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,800
Checkmate.

71
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,000
That's the first time in 11 years.

72
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,100
Another game Frank?

73
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,600
Lacey, have a wonder.

74
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,200
- I'm not really in the mood.
- Have a wonder.

75
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,400
Hey kid.

76
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,600
Five minutes.

77
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,100
What?

78
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,100
The air vents in the laundry.

79
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,200
Would they connect to a sewer?

80
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,299
- Come again?
- The back of the dryer's.

81
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,500
Would they connect to the sewer system?

82
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,200
Frank, what's going on?

83
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,500
My first letter in 14 years.

84
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,000
Telling me our little girl's
a junkie.

85
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,200
Her heart stopped twice.

86
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,700
- She's a.. she's not comin'..
- No.

87
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,200
Before it happens again..

88
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,500
I gotta see her.

89
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,900
- I gotta make things right.
- Frank!

90
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,700
I want out, Brodie.

91
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,000
Not in a month,
not six.

92
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,300
Now.

93
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,138
The air vents in the
laundry, do they connect?

94
00:25:24,151 --> 00:25:26,300
Frank, your not
thinking straight..

95
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,700
Does it connect?
I'm not asking again.

96
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,100
Yeah.

97
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,700
But the air vent, it'll be capped.
You won't go through solid steel.

98
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,800
- Lenny Drake can.
- Lenny Drake? his walking in a few.

99
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,500
His parole's been revoked.
Hedge's grassing him for early release.

100
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,000
Suppose you get past the door cap,

101
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,888
the vent'll only take us
as far as the perimeter.

102
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:52,700
As soon as your there
you'll be picked up.

103
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,100
That's why I'll go deeper.

104
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,399
- No, I'm not going back down there.
- I'm telling you, you don't have to.

105
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,388
Jesus, Frank. You know
why I'm in this dump.

106
00:26:00,401 --> 00:26:02,400
- Would you listen?

107
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,900
- I want you to tell me, not take me.
- I can't tell you.

108
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,200
Fuck.

109
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,700
I can't even even draw you a map.

110
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,600
Is your mind made up?

111
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,500
Frank!

112
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Without me, you'll be lost in minutes.

113
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,600
Stare at someone else.

114
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:47,600
- I'm not in the mood for a chat today.
- I can understand that.

115
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,100
Cunt snitched me out.

116
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,100
Well I tell ya, nobody was
more surprised than I was.

117
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,700
He walks early and I
go out for Gomez?

118
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:03,300
So I murdered a guard,
Hedge's.. Fucker was holding him down.

119
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,000
When walk out that door..

120
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,300
Suppose I could get you
out the door, with me?

121
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,000
Don't fuck with me, Perry!
I told you I'm not in the mood.

122
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:22,800
What would you prefer to smack? that
bit of leather, or your number two?

123
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,800
Smack?

124
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,900
I had something more brutal in mind.

125
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,200
You walk through walls, Lenny.
And that's useful.

126
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,300
Is it?

127
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,800
Say we talk..
and you're not interested,

128
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,100
Well it goes without saying
we never talked.

129
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,100
Yeah, goes without saying.

130
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,700
Domino.

131
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,300
Three players.

132
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,700
Alright. Barriers.

133
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,700
One.

134
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,299
Two.

135
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,400
Three.

136
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,800
- Locks?
- Bolt and key.

137
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,900
No chance.

138
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,900
I'm a thief, not a magician.

139
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:48,100
- There is another way.
- How?

140
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,900
Shower drain.

141
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Directly above.

142
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,100
There's the same problem above.
And more barriers.

143
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,300
Only one. The chapel wall.

144
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,400
- It'll take all night.
- Ever considered confessing?

145
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:12,200
Back of the confession room..
panels.. loose.

146
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,400
And the chapel door?

147
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,200
What about the tools?

148
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,200
The Lord..

149
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,000
Provides.

150
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,200
Domino.

151
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,700
The first time we hit a tile,
screws'll come running.

152
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,300
- Alarm's would be louder.
- Who sets them of?

153
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:22,700
- We do, when they caught on to us missing.
- It's an obstacle course as it is.

154
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,299
If they're onto us from the off..

155
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:29,500
We'll be over the drains when the alarm
goes by the time they leave the spar..

156
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,638
We'll be in the laundry.

157
00:32:31,651 --> 00:32:33,400
How long have you got
before you're in the laundry?

158
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,700
Five minutes.. tops.

159
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,000
That's enough.

160
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,700
Alright.

161
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,900
Next piece.
The dryer.

162
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,300
- Locks?
- Older than me.

163
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,500
What about the cap? on the vent.

164
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,800
You don't worry about that.

165
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,100
- I'll sort my end.
- Yeah, yeah I do worry.

166
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,100
Have you got something
that cuts through steel?

167
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,500
I've got whatever it takes.

168
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:27,200
Five minutes of your time.

169
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:35,100
I think I may have found
you a challenge.

170
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,699
Domino.

171
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:48,000
From the minute we're inside,
you don't breathe, you don't talk.

172
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:52,000
That far underground, banter echo's.

173
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:56,200
Ignore your thinking,
it'll only be playing tricks.

174
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,000
Things are different down there.

175
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,100
The laundry vent'll take us to here,
top of the sump.

176
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,400
Then we go deep.

177
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,500
There's a drainage tunnel.

178
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,600
Now were gonna need to get through
that.. after that,

179
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,400
as far, as the river.

180
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,000
- What river?
- We're south, remember?

181
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,900
I can't swim.

182
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,100
No? We go under it.

183
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,100
There's a reservoir under the embankment.

184
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,000
It connects to the rail network.

185
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:38,900
Once we're on the tracks,
All roads, lead to Rome.

186
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,200
Charing cross, that's where we surface.

187
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,238
Why so far? There's got
to be stations closer?

188
00:35:43,251 --> 00:35:45,200
Plenty of exits.

189
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,138
Easy to disappear, if
we head for rush hour.

190
00:35:47,151 --> 00:35:49,000
No, before rush hour.

191
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,100
Track goes live at five.
630 Volts.

192
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,299
If we're not on the platform,
by then, we're tap-dancing.

193
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,400
How do you know all this?
How's he know all this?

194
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,000
Because I shovelled shit down there
for 12 years.

195
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,200
Prosperous holiday for you then.

196
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,400
Ok. How much time?

197
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:15,400
The night bell rings about 9.
That gives us eight hours into the AM.

198
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,100
- When do we go?
- How much do you need?

199
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,500
Three days.

200
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,700
That's good for me.

201
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,600
On Friday..

202
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,800
we away.

203
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,699
Oh, one more thing,

204
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,600
Just make sure you don't get
murdered that night.

205
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,200
There you go, proof that David
and Goliath, is cock.. and bullshit.

206
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,000
Wouldn't be to sure.

207
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,600
Did you drop something?

208
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,500
Didn't see you there.

209
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,400
No, you didn't.

210
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,100
Fancy yourself do you, Frank?

211
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,300
What?

212
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,600
You got permission?

213
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,200
You done.

214
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,800
Fuck.

215
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,800
Fuck.. that's not gonna make
Rizza happy.

216
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,200
The trouble is, if I open my
mouth,

217
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,400
he'd like to piss in yours.

218
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:37,200
I could sort somethimg out,
avoid any trouble.

219
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,500
What?

220
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,000
Time out, Frank.
With Len gone.

221
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:48,000
I can run faster.

222
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,200
To find out Rizza's gonna,
make sure you don't go anywhere.

223
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,000
Unless you sort me out.

224
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,700
Yeah, that's right.

225
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,600
You won't get enough?

226
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,500
First bill tomorrow, Frank.

227
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,300
In your cell, Frank, yeah?

228
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,000
First bell.

229
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,000
Drop it!

230
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:06,000
Don't you do this, I will not let
you fuck this up!

231
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,400
'Fish and Chips " with salt and vinegar?
How about that?"

232
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,100
You got to be looking forward to that.

233
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,200
Yeah?

234
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,400
Park bench in the sun..

235
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:38,999
A beautiful large portion
of.. fresh battered cod,

236
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,900
wrapped in a newspaper.

237
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,800
Watching beautiful girls jog by..
You know what I mean?

238
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,400
No.

239
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,700
You alright?

240
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,400
What?

241
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,100
Tony.

242
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,300
- Fuck.
- What?

243
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,200
How the fuck, did he find out?

244
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,600
- What does he want?
- Half a key

245
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,688
Half a fucking key? That's more
than a little grounds worth.

246
00:46:15,701 --> 00:46:17,700
We've got options.

247
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,800
Yeah, I suggest the option,
that murders him.

248
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:24,800
And have Rizza on our backs.
Not a chance, Tony's untouchable.

249
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,500
Not, Tony, Batista. We get
rid of him and pocket his stash.

250
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,200
Where do we look, under
his mattress? Check in his pockets?

251
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:35,299
The guy's got an operation going on,
don't you think his smarter than that.

252
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,999
Prick's not made of fucking, kryptonite!

253
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,100
Nobody's getting their hands
bloody for Tony. Nobody!

254
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
- Are you killing him?
- No.

255
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,300
So?

256
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,000
What if..

257
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:57,100
A ticket out, is worth something to,
Batista?

258
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,100
Half a key?

259
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,200
- And you want me to give it to you?
- No.

260
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,800
It's a trade.

261
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,200
Who else is going?

262
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,500
Brodie.

263
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,500
And Lenny Drake.

264
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,000
Lenny Drake?

265
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:19,100
Half a key of CAT,
cleans me out for a month.

266
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,100
Tony knows that.

267
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:26,100
So..
Tony's got a taste for it.

268
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,900
He think you kill me for it,
or steal it.

269
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,500
Which puts me in a coffin, or worse
if I don't deliver it for Rizza.

270
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Besides..

271
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,499
If Tony knows, then Tony know's.

272
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,700
He's the devil on your back now.

273
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:49,600
But you will not trade,
I give out trade.

274
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:57,000
CAT's, are dangerous drug,
but deadly when poison.

275
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,700
You get me?

276
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:07,800
If it looks,
smells and tastes like CAT's..

277
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,799
- Who will know?
- No one touches Tony.

278
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,200
- Rizza will..
- Rizza?

279
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,100
Who's gonna tell Rizza?

280
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:22,000
Junkies die, every day.

281
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,800
Alright.

282
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,900
That's a trade.

283
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,000
Shit.

284
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,200
Brodie, wait!

285
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,600
Brodie..

286
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:32,800
<i>Lights out.</i>

287
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,800
You smoke?

288
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,400
That was the last time I saw her.

289
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:03,500
She'll be 21 tomorrow.

290
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:30,399
# He took a knife and he cut her down. #

291
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:36,300
# And on her bosom, these lines he found #

292
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,999
# Oh, what a foolish girl #

293
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:49,200
# was I, to hang myself,
for a butcher's boy. #

294
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:55,099
# Go dig my grave,
both wide and deep. #

295
00:56:55,100 --> 00:57:00,600
# Put a marble stone
at my head and feet #

296
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:06,200
# And on my grave.. #

297
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:41,900
# ..I die for love. #

298
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:00,600
This is cozy.

299
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,900
You should wrap a blanket,
'round him, Frankie, he's cold.

300
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:11,600
- Give us a minute.
- No.

301
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,200
No, he stays.

302
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,400
I like his company.

303
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,400
Got something for me have you, Frank.

304
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,300
What's Sykes doin' here?

305
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,500
Call it a peace of mind.

306
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,300
How do I know, you'll keep
your mouth shut up?

307
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:50,700
- Your lucky your still fucking standing.
- I need a guarantee.

308
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,300
- Anymore?
- It is trade.

309
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,400
I want a guarantee that you'll keep your
mouth shut, otherwise there is no deal.

310
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:03,900
You don't, make rules.

311
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,000
Yeah.

312
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,800
Have a burn.

313
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,400
Rizza! Ri.. Ri..

314
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,800
Rizza!

315
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,900
It's okay kid.. it's okay.
It's okay.

316
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,400
Open the door's.

317
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:53,100
<i>Do it, Perry! Now</i>

318
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,100
Frank..

319
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,200
Frank.

320
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,900
- I see something.
- What?

321
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:26,600
Well he came out of nowhere.

322
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:30,700
Wh.. you couldn't do a thing?

323
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,200
- Well he's a walking corpse now.
- We all are.

324
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:37,100
Why?
Little kid did the job for us.

325
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,800
As soon as he finds Sykes,
Rizza will hit wind, with the palm.

326
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,700
Rizza's upwind.

327
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:47,000
The only thing he knows,
is that Tony took a fall.

328
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:50,600
And Lacey?
What happens to him now?

329
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:52,799
He will not be in the hole for long.

330
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,700
Rizza, will make sure of that.

331
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,500
Will he hump the Rizza?

332
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:02,800
Which weigh's more, Frank?
A tonne of bricks..

333
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:06,100
or a ton of feathers?

334
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:10,700
He is a dead man,
with or without us, Frank.

335
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,900
So we leave tomorrow,
as planned.

336
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,138
Where are you going?

337
01:06:24,151 --> 01:06:26,300
It's been awhile, since
my last confession.

338
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:14,400
Listen.. leave it.

339
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,500
Follow him!

340
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:23,900
Let's move, we've got one hour
before the tracks go live.

341
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:29,000
Listen!

342
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:34,200
- They've found us!
- Let's move!

343
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:45,000
Keep running!

344
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:43,400
Hello, Frank.

345
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,300
Hello, Rizza.

346
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:58,400
- I was sorry about your brother.
- Why's that? Did you kill him?

347
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:02,500
- Well, I had no reason.
- Well, there's always reason's.

348
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,500
He was a junkie,
a cunt, nobody liked him.

349
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:18,400
I don't smoke, Frank. I don't
like smoke around me.

350
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,000
You got family, Frank?

351
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:29,200
Yeah.

352
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,700
Any young?

353
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:44,500
Aww, she's a gorgeous one.

354
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:47,200
Do you love her?

355
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:51,200
Family is important.

356
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,200
But the only important thing.

357
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:58,300
So I'll only ask once.

358
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,900
I won't ask again.

359
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,400
He was talking to the lad.

360
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,900
He had a thing for him.

361
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:19,900
Tony, was over by the doorway..

362
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,400
Making moves on him.

363
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:26,000
Sykes..

364
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:29,000
Pulled him from the doorway.

365
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:32,800
I heard them Arguing..
Fighting.

366
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,700
After a minute.

367
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:39,800
There whole, spur was quiet.

368
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,700
You don't have much..

369
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,138
yet you just subtracted,
from what's left.

370
01:10:50,151 --> 01:10:51,500
Rizza..

371
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,900
You lie to me one more time..

372
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:04,100
They're bringing your boy out tonight.

373
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:09,100
I want him in my cell, before
closing time. You bring him.

374
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:19,200
You got one thing kind for you, Frank.

375
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:22,500
You're too old, to die young.

376
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:12,900
- You alright?
- No.

377
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,200
He's alright.

378
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Stay with us, Frank!

379
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,800
Are you ready?

380
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,100
Perry?

381
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:10,600
Batista, Mitra,
Parkhurst.

382
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,400
Visiting room.

383
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,400
Wait.. Frank.

384
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:40,000
Let's move.
Before these tracks go live.

385
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,100
Frank!

386
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:52,800
Frank, move now!

387
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,100
Help me.

388
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:59,200
Go, go, go!

389
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:02,100
Go!

390
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,200
Hurry!

391
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,500
Sit down.

392
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:54,400
Where you from, lad?

393
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,600
London.

394
01:18:56,700 --> 01:19:00,000
- Old Street.
- Old Street?

395
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:07,000
I can't remember my street.

396
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:24,300
Rizza's, waiting for you, in his cell.

397
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:27,400
Want's me to take you there.

398
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,100
Go to the chapel, lad,

399
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,900
Before the end bell.

400
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:48,600
And make your confession.
Give this to Brodie.

401
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,400
- I don't understand.
- Yes, you do.

402
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,100
Why me, Frank.

403
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:14,400
You remind me of someone.

404
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:43,400
<i>Five minutes.</i>

405
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:25,000
Where is he?

406
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:34,400
You know..

407
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:40,100
I must have read this book,
about a dozen times.

408
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,400
If I had my time again, and I could
start over like, Rereading this book.

409
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:56,450
It'd be someone, I'd sit down
and talk to.

410
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:02,700
I'd talk some sense into him, tell him
how things really are.

411
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:06,000
But I can't.

412
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:09,300
That man's long gone,

413
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:12,800
and I'm all that's left.

414
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:22,900
- Where is he?
- But do you know something?

415
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:26,000
I'm free now.

416
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:29,000
- Like my little girl.
- Free?

417
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:32,400
- You've got an imagination.
- Imagination's what protects us.

418
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:35,600
It's what keeps us alive.

419
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:42,900
But, your still living,
but less and less.

420
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:48,800
Inside, you own this place.

421
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:50,900
You run things,

422
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,900
you're the king,
but look around you, what do you see?

423
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,499
It's all prepared.

424
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:01,300
It's all made up.

425
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:04,400
You own nothing.

426
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:10,200
Nothing except cells, bars
and a rusty metal staircase.

427
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:19,000
You'll never live.. because outside,
you don't exist.

428
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:28,300
- No one will remember you.
- You, behave yourself.

429
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:34,900
Behaving myself, it's what's
kept me living this long.

430
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:48,000
- You tell me where he is.
- Lacey?

431
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:50,500
He'll be alright.

432
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:57,900
- He's gone, Rizza.
- What did you say?

433
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:00,699
Gone.

434
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:03,300
Where's Frank?

435
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,600
The lad's free.

436
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:17,400
Don't you walk away from me!

437
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:21,100
It's like you said

438
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:25,300
I'm too old..

439
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:24,100
Alarm!

440
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:29,100
Frank..

441
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,600
Frank!

442
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:08,800
I got no air.

443
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:13,400
Brodie..

444
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:14,799
Frank.

445
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,100
- Frank.
- Frank!

446
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:29,700
There's no air.

447
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:32,200
I can't breathe.

448
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,300
Can't breathe.

449
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:39,900
You stay with us, Frank

450
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:44,200
- Stay with us!
- Come on, Frank!

451
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:54,600
Come on, Frank.
Come on.

452
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,900
We are free.

453
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,300
