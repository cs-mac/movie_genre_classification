1
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,945
Don't try and stop me this time.

2
00:02:56,513 --> 00:02:57,707
Who's trying to stop you?

3
00:02:58,014 --> 00:03:01,324
I wish you a safe journey
and a good time travelling.

4
00:03:23,747 --> 00:03:26,215
I'm going to L.A.
and find people who love me.

5
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:30,310
And those people will find me a job
that will make me a lot of money.

6
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,400
Please, Ellie! Don't go!

7
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:36,516
Say goodbye to Ellie, Lena.
She's going to L.A.

8
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,717
Oh, wow. Bye, Ellie!

9
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,695
Oh. I'll get the phone.

10
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,983
Have a pleasant trip.

11
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,912
I'm leaving!

12
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,796
Were you really gonna run away?

13
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,623
I always mean to run away.

14
00:03:57,945 --> 00:04:00,220
But when I walk out that
door, I think of Dad.

15
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,087
Can you imagine what he
would do if I left?

16
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,381
No, I can't.

17
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:07,731
Inger! He would freak out.

18
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:11,011
He would no longer
have a reason to live.

19
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,377
Jeez, really?

20
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,063
Yes.

21
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:18,688
I mean, if I left, it would mean
he'd be totally alone with Mom.

22
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,480
-And me!
-Right. And you.

23
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:41,892
God, I hate school.

24
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:44,674
Hey, Sasquatch!

25
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,823
-Leave her alone.
-Oh, yeah?

26
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:49,793
Just ignore them, okay?

27
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,518
What will you do, dinger?

28
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:56,793
Leon, I'm having a really
shitty day today. So get lost, okay?

29
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:59,040
It's not until I get this close...

30
00:04:59,378 --> 00:05:03,496
...that I realize what a big,
ugly bitch that you really are.

31
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:08,565
Back off, all of you,
or I'll pull his hair out.

32
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:10,282
Do it!

33
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:12,386
Farther, you fuckers!

34
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:16,754
Oh, shit!

35
00:05:29,907 --> 00:05:31,226
What's the problem?

36
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:34,331
You don't give me
the benefit of the fucking doubt.

37
00:05:34,703 --> 00:05:35,897
Karen, please--

38
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:38,399
Ben, if I say that she's
acting up again...

39
00:05:38,748 --> 00:05:42,024
...l expect you to believe me
and help me deal with it.

40
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,137
You know, Mom, we love you too.

41
00:05:48,925 --> 00:05:52,122
And what about this attempted
murder charge at the bus stop?

42
00:05:53,929 --> 00:05:55,203
Not guilty.

43
00:05:56,807 --> 00:06:00,243
Well, I'm starving.
I'm gonna see what's for dinner.

44
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:11,840
Wait up.

45
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:18,453
What you doing?

46
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:21,133
Cover me. I'm going in.

47
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,981
Hi, Bobby. Ellie's inside the truck.

48
00:06:28,337 --> 00:06:29,406
Oh, hi, Ellie.

49
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:31,540
Oh, hi, Bobby.

50
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:34,380
You guys are moving?

51
00:06:34,676 --> 00:06:37,713
Mom and I are leaving because
Dad can't pay his bills.

52
00:06:39,222 --> 00:06:40,814
Your dad's not coming with you?

53
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,619
No.

54
00:06:46,562 --> 00:06:48,280
Want to get out of my truck?

55
00:06:49,023 --> 00:06:50,376
Come on, get out of here.

56
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:51,965
-Bobby said I could.
-Did not.

57
00:06:52,274 --> 00:06:53,707
-Did too.
-Brat.

58
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:01,146
Lena, could you come upstairs?
I need you to run some errands.

59
00:07:03,618 --> 00:07:05,370
I'll be right there.

60
00:07:08,873 --> 00:07:10,625
-Hey!
-The keys.

61
00:07:15,421 --> 00:07:16,854
You'll miss me, pookie.

62
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:33,320
Enjoy the show?

63
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:17,453
-Lawson, wait.
-Let's do it in his house.

64
00:08:17,771 --> 00:08:19,409
No, no.

65
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,732
I'm getting out of this place,
immediately.

66
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:31,587
That's fantastic.
That's the best news.

67
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:34,237
I'm ready to go right now.
Let's get out.

68
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:35,897
Look...

69
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,246
...it'll just be me and the girls.

70
00:08:40,584 --> 00:08:42,176
What do you mean?
We had plans.

71
00:08:42,502 --> 00:08:43,651
I know it's difficult.

72
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:45,873
-You can't leave now.
-Control yourself.

73
00:08:46,173 --> 00:08:47,526
You fucking bitch!

74
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:50,112
Oh, baby.

75
00:08:54,806 --> 00:08:56,956
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.

76
00:09:07,818 --> 00:09:09,570
What was that?

77
00:09:20,663 --> 00:09:22,301
There's nothing there.

78
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:42,312
God, Jesus. I'm gonna miss this.

79
00:09:50,274 --> 00:09:52,947
Lena, could you stop?
I want to speak to you.

80
00:09:53,736 --> 00:09:55,135
Is something wrong?

81
00:09:55,571 --> 00:09:56,924
I have to let you go.

82
00:09:57,782 --> 00:10:02,094
Look, you've been really great, but
we just won't be needing you here.

83
00:10:02,995 --> 00:10:05,873
Here's two weeks' wages. You'll also
find a very nice recommendation.

84
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,645
Excuse me.
What's going on here?

85
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:12,015
You're being fired.

86
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:27,814
Ellie, lnger! I'm home!

87
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,589
Hi, Dad.

88
00:10:31,313 --> 00:10:33,065
There you go.

89
00:10:37,736 --> 00:10:39,408
And what did you get me?

90
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:42,816
It's a makeup kit.
I don't know what's in there...

91
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:46,635
...but the lady at the store said
it was a starter set for girls.

92
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:53,531
Thanks, Dad.

93
00:10:54,668 --> 00:10:56,420
You're welcome, honey.

94
00:11:05,219 --> 00:11:08,052
Lena didn't say what kind of
personal emergency?

95
00:11:09,473 --> 00:11:10,588
No, she didn't.

96
00:11:12,434 --> 00:11:13,753
Not a word?

97
00:11:14,603 --> 00:11:17,640
I'm not as interested in her
personal life as you are.

98
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:21,784
What's that supposed to mean?

99
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,987
You fired her because you
felt like it!

100
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,232
No, I fired her because I know you
want to fuck her!

101
00:11:27,573 --> 00:11:31,122
-If you haven't already.
-That's really rich, Karen....

102
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,177
It's only a 40 minute drive
to and from work.

103
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:43,104
It doesn't matter, Ben,
because I've had it.

104
00:11:43,463 --> 00:11:45,215
I'm taking my children
and getting out.

105
00:11:45,507 --> 00:11:48,658
What do you mean, "your" children?
How about "our" children?

106
00:11:49,302 --> 00:11:51,054
You think I'll let you take them?

107
00:11:51,387 --> 00:11:53,582
There's nothing you can do about it.

108
00:11:53,931 --> 00:11:57,446
-We'll see what a lawyer has to say.
-Yes, we will.

109
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,598
Oh, that's just great, Karen, great.
Good night!

110
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:35,062
Dad, is that you?

111
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:38,606
I just thought it would be better....

112
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:42,879
Hey.

113
00:12:44,312 --> 00:12:45,665
You look great.

114
00:12:46,898 --> 00:12:48,217
Thanks.

115
00:12:55,531 --> 00:12:56,964
Couldn't sleep?

116
00:12:57,658 --> 00:12:58,727
No.

117
00:13:01,703 --> 00:13:04,695
You're wearing that ring
I got you last month.

118
00:13:05,248 --> 00:13:09,161
Yeah, I never take it off.
I even sleep in it.

119
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:13,221
Hadn't you noticed?

120
00:13:14,757 --> 00:13:15,792
Yeah.

121
00:13:20,471 --> 00:13:22,223
You love me, don't you?

122
00:13:24,225 --> 00:13:26,785
-Yeah, sure.
-No, I'm serious.

123
00:13:27,561 --> 00:13:28,710
Don't be silly.

124
00:13:28,979 --> 00:13:30,128
You really mean it?

125
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:32,191
Ellie, come on.

126
00:13:35,068 --> 00:13:37,901
Look, I'm gonna tell you a story...

127
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:41,828
...and I'm only telling you this
because you seem a little down.

128
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:44,927
You promise you won't get
a big head about it?

129
00:13:49,623 --> 00:13:54,139
I was talking to Lawson and he asked
me which one of you I loved more.

130
00:13:54,545 --> 00:13:58,857
And I said I loved both you
and lnger equally, and he said:

131
00:14:00,217 --> 00:14:04,005
" Bullshit. You always feel
differently about each of them."

132
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,114
But I didn't want to tell him
how I felt.

133
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:12,395
I didn't tell him how
you were my favourite.

134
00:14:14,397 --> 00:14:15,432
Dad.

135
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:17,923
Really?

136
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,637
-What is that you have on?
-Dad's makeup.

137
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,367
You're not going to school
like that, young lady.

138
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,712
Oh, yes, I am.

139
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:53,767
You're gonna take it off now.

140
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,853
You're just jealous.

141
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,859
-Ellie, you are just--
-Stop!

142
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,588
Don't you push me!

143
00:15:00,855 --> 00:15:02,288
You're ruining it!

144
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,811
-I'll just put it back on.
-No, you won't.

145
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:08,108
I'm putting it right back on!

146
00:15:08,446 --> 00:15:10,038
Over my dead body!

147
00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:11,884
Let go of me!

148
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,754
Hi, Karen. I was wondering
if you would be able--

149
00:15:31,092 --> 00:15:32,286
Karen, what's wrong?

150
00:15:34,762 --> 00:15:39,631
It's been one of those mornings.
Ellie, it's time to go to school!

151
00:15:49,568 --> 00:15:51,718
I would really appreciate it,
thank you. Oh, hi, Ellie.

152
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,742
Goodbye, Mrs. Potter.

153
00:15:56,783 --> 00:15:58,933
She's a moody one.

154
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:17,022
Hi, you've reached the home of the
Christiansons. Just leave a message.

155
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:04,706
Hello?

156
00:17:15,273 --> 00:17:16,467
Hello?

157
00:18:10,116 --> 00:18:12,425
What's going on?
I heard someone got snuffed.

158
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:29,127
Ellie's gonna be home soon.

159
00:19:09,547 --> 00:19:10,866
What's going on?

160
00:19:19,348 --> 00:19:20,497
Ellie?

161
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:23,495
Could you come up here?

162
00:19:23,811 --> 00:19:25,847
I have something important
to tell you.

163
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:47,757
Your mother's dead.

164
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,379
I loved her, Ellie.

165
00:20:19,154 --> 00:20:22,112
I can never love anyone
llke I loved her.

166
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,514
I can never marry again.

167
00:20:40,257 --> 00:20:42,168
-Hey!
-Hi, sir.

168
00:20:43,469 --> 00:20:46,347
-What are you doing?
-Shooting overalls, sir.

169
00:21:21,755 --> 00:21:23,268
Boland...

170
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:25,762
...what are you doing here?

171
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:27,453
Well, Ritchie...

172
00:21:28,386 --> 00:21:31,378
...a white woman got knocked dead
in her own home...

173
00:21:31,764 --> 00:21:35,518
...inside a gated community.
Don't you think they'd call me?

174
00:21:37,186 --> 00:21:39,302
-I see.
-What do you got?

175
00:21:42,524 --> 00:21:45,118
Burglar broke in the back door...

176
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:48,094
...not counting on the presence
of Karen Christianson.

177
00:21:48,447 --> 00:21:51,598
Surprise, struggle, and there she is.

178
00:21:51,992 --> 00:21:53,630
Burglar? Anything taken?

179
00:21:53,952 --> 00:21:55,510
Her diamond wedding ring.

180
00:21:56,746 --> 00:21:57,895
Really?

181
00:22:12,427 --> 00:22:13,940
Mr. Christianson?

182
00:22:16,765 --> 00:22:17,914
Yes?

183
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:20,575
I need to talk to you,
whenever you're ready.

184
00:22:25,023 --> 00:22:26,661
Notice anything missing?

185
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,766
Besides the ring?

186
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,208
No, not yet, anyway.

187
00:22:36,784 --> 00:22:41,938
When I was down in your dining room,
I noticed a Greek drama mask.

188
00:22:42,748 --> 00:22:46,058
They usually come in pairs,
you know: Tragedy, Comedy.

189
00:22:47,168 --> 00:22:48,362
I only saw Comedy.

190
00:22:49,671 --> 00:22:52,105
I don't know where the other one is.
We had two.

191
00:22:55,384 --> 00:22:58,694
Anything unusual or strange going
on between you two?

192
00:22:59,305 --> 00:23:00,454
Arguments, or...

193
00:23:01,432 --> 00:23:02,706
...fistfights?

194
00:23:02,975 --> 00:23:03,851
-No.
-Really?

195
00:23:04,143 --> 00:23:05,132
No.

196
00:23:06,645 --> 00:23:09,762
Nothing important, that is.
Our marriage was great.

197
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,916
-You have no idea who did this?
-No.

198
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,475
No suspicions?

199
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:18,013
No.

200
00:23:18,946 --> 00:23:23,098
Well, that'll be all for now.
I'll be in touch.

201
00:23:36,755 --> 00:23:37,983
I knew her pretty well.

202
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:41,847
She'd always help out with
my things for Casa Del Norte.

203
00:23:42,635 --> 00:23:43,988
Did you llke her?

204
00:23:44,303 --> 00:23:46,692
Oh, yes. Very much.

205
00:23:47,306 --> 00:23:48,785
Well, somebody didn't.

206
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:51,533
What's your name?

207
00:23:51,852 --> 00:23:53,649
Amaryllis Potter.

208
00:23:53,937 --> 00:23:55,495
Amaryllis?

209
00:23:56,815 --> 00:23:58,407
Like the flower?

210
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:02,521
Yeah. Like the flower.

211
00:24:04,614 --> 00:24:05,933
My wife left me.

212
00:24:06,241 --> 00:24:08,391
Well, it sure looks that way.

213
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:12,971
What can you tell me about
the Christiansons?

214
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:15,097
Not much. Not much.

215
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:19,898
-You weren't friendly with them?
-I wasn't very close with them.

216
00:24:20,588 --> 00:24:22,783
They llve about 1 00 feet from you.

217
00:24:23,132 --> 00:24:24,531
Well, so what?

218
00:24:24,842 --> 00:24:26,753
I'd call that close, wouldn't you?

219
00:24:27,761 --> 00:24:29,831
-Lay off.
-Why are you upset?

220
00:24:30,138 --> 00:24:32,208
Of course I'm upset.
Christ, Karen's dead.

221
00:24:32,557 --> 00:24:34,275
" Karen"?

222
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:36,731
You mean Mrs. Christianson.

223
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:39,859
Yes, Mrs. Christianson.

224
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:43,192
You have an affair
with Mrs. Christianson?

225
00:24:44,402 --> 00:24:46,996
All right, llsten.
You can screw around...

226
00:24:47,363 --> 00:24:49,433
...and stIll not have killed her.

227
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,573
A lot of people screw around.
I used to screw around.

228
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:56,386
Does the husband know?

229
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,247
No murder weapon. No ring.

230
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:05,622
So he's not a total moron,
he could've stashed it away.

231
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:09,042
-It doesn't mean a thing.
-You really think it's him?

232
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:10,987
Him...

233
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,524
...or somebody else.

234
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,274
--an entrance into the land
of llght and joy...

235
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,715
...in the fellowship of thy sense.

236
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:24,216
Through Jesus Christ, Our Lord. Amen.

237
00:26:03,684 --> 00:26:05,436
Your mommy loves you.

238
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,153
You're my number one girl.

239
00:26:11,942 --> 00:26:15,821
You're the special one.
I love you, baby.

240
00:26:23,286 --> 00:26:25,083
Wait for me in the car, okay?

241
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:27,778
Lena.

242
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:30,354
Oh, hi, Ben.

243
00:26:32,879 --> 00:26:34,597
Oh, baby.

244
00:26:35,715 --> 00:26:38,548
I was worried.
Where have you been?

245
00:26:38,926 --> 00:26:41,440
At a hotel.
Pollce went through the place...

246
00:26:41,804 --> 00:26:43,954
...and we didn't want to
go back right away.

247
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,188
-Sorry I didn't call.
-No, no. I'm sorry, I understand.

248
00:26:48,518 --> 00:26:49,997
I need some time, Lena.

249
00:26:50,312 --> 00:26:53,304
Just wait a couple of weeks
before we see each other.

250
00:26:54,983 --> 00:26:56,132
We'll talk later.

251
00:26:56,442 --> 00:26:58,194
Yeah. I'll call you.

252
00:26:59,237 --> 00:27:01,467
-I'll call you.
-Okay.

253
00:27:01,864 --> 00:27:02,819
Dad!

254
00:27:03,741 --> 00:27:06,050
Let me just say hi to the girls.

255
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,968
Hi, Ellie.

256
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:51,508
Mr. Christianson, are you okay?

257
00:27:52,327 --> 00:27:53,555
Mr. Christianson?

258
00:27:58,541 --> 00:27:59,894
What's for dinner?

259
00:28:03,087 --> 00:28:04,281
Dad?

260
00:28:05,047 --> 00:28:07,766
Can we move away from here?

261
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:10,909
Of course, but not right away.

262
00:28:11,262 --> 00:28:12,092
Why not?

263
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:16,639
Well, we have to sell
the house first.

264
00:28:17,017 --> 00:28:21,488
-It's the middle of a school year--
-Dad, I'm scared.

265
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:25,116
Oh, honey.

266
00:28:27,652 --> 00:28:30,291
Mrs. Potter installed an alarm system.

267
00:28:30,613 --> 00:28:31,568
We're okay.

268
00:28:31,823 --> 00:28:35,782
Hey, I have an idea.
What if we all slept in here tonight?

269
00:28:36,202 --> 00:28:37,874
Can we, Dad?

270
00:29:04,603 --> 00:29:06,002
Good morning, Lawson.

271
00:29:06,772 --> 00:29:08,524
Hi, Ben. How's everything?

272
00:29:08,857 --> 00:29:11,007
I'm hanging in there.
How about yourself?

273
00:29:11,318 --> 00:29:12,637
No complaints.

274
00:29:12,903 --> 00:29:16,373
Except for this maintenance increase
that Mrs. Potter gave me.

275
00:29:16,782 --> 00:29:18,181
Oh, that. Right.

276
00:29:18,492 --> 00:29:21,006
We discussed that last Tuesday.
You weren't there.

277
00:29:21,369 --> 00:29:24,281
No, no. I'm thinking of moving out.

278
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:29,233
-I never go to those fucking meetings.
-Right. Those fucking meetings.

279
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:30,658
They're boring.

280
00:29:30,962 --> 00:29:32,714
Yeah, those fucking meetings.

281
00:29:33,047 --> 00:29:36,164
-Anyway, I just saw the pollce leave.
-That's right.

282
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,939
Right. So they questioned you?

283
00:29:39,303 --> 00:29:41,259
Yes, they did.

284
00:29:43,306 --> 00:29:45,422
-And now you are.
-You seem on edge.

285
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:48,565
-I'm sleeping fine at night.
-Let's just calm down.

286
00:29:48,937 --> 00:29:52,850
-I'm calm. Are you calm?
-I think we're both calm.

287
00:29:53,274 --> 00:29:54,389
Good.

288
00:29:56,903 --> 00:29:59,576
Why don't we just let the pollce
do their jobs?

289
00:29:59,905 --> 00:30:02,499
If you have a problem,
take it up with them.

290
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,380
What did you just say to--?

291
00:30:09,081 --> 00:30:10,070
Shit.

292
00:30:25,596 --> 00:30:29,475
Where do you think you're going?
You have to vacuum the llving room.

293
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:33,286
But I just did the upstairs.
And it's not even dirty.

294
00:30:34,021 --> 00:30:37,297
It's fllthy. I wIll not
have Dad see the house this way.

295
00:30:38,317 --> 00:30:39,432
Do it!

296
00:30:39,985 --> 00:30:42,783
Jeez. Who died and made you boss?

297
00:30:44,531 --> 00:30:45,680
Okay.

298
00:30:54,373 --> 00:30:55,692
Shit!

299
00:31:08,261 --> 00:31:11,059
Take a picture, Lawson.
It'll last longer.

300
00:31:16,894 --> 00:31:19,567
Inger, I thought I told you
to vacuum in here.

301
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:22,906
What are you doing?
Put that mask down!

302
00:31:23,273 --> 00:31:25,741
-I'm just looking at it.
-Give it to me.

303
00:31:26,902 --> 00:31:28,381
Now, who could that be?

304
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:29,928
You pest!

305
00:31:30,197 --> 00:31:32,028
Give it to me, lnger!

306
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:38,391
Give me that mask, you llttle brat!

307
00:31:46,003 --> 00:31:47,402
I'll kill you!

308
00:31:50,466 --> 00:31:51,455
Give me that mask!

309
00:31:52,134 --> 00:31:53,408
Girls?

310
00:31:53,677 --> 00:31:56,316
Girls, it's me! I've got some food.

311
00:31:58,765 --> 00:32:00,118
Let go!

312
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,592
Oh, my God!
Girls, what are you doing? Stop it!

313
00:32:04,229 --> 00:32:05,582
Ellie, stop it!

314
00:32:07,774 --> 00:32:09,093
Listen, kids fight.

315
00:32:09,358 --> 00:32:12,953
Oh, I know. I mean,
I have a sister, and we fought.

316
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,630
I mean, belleve me,
we fought llke hell.

317
00:32:17,032 --> 00:32:20,707
But, I mean, we pulled hair,
or pinched or kicked.

318
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,075
I mean, we didn't strangle.

319
00:32:23,372 --> 00:32:25,727
Aren't you making too much of this?

320
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:31,240
Strangllng. Serial killers strangle,
not sibllngs.

321
00:32:31,754 --> 00:32:36,464
I mean, they're girls.
All alone, unattended here.

322
00:32:38,636 --> 00:32:42,151
Ben, I really know what it's llke
to be a single parent.

323
00:32:42,556 --> 00:32:46,469
When I was a kid, I hit my brother
over the head with a hammer.

324
00:32:46,935 --> 00:32:49,688
If I'd killed him, my llfe
would be very different.

325
00:32:53,442 --> 00:32:57,401
Ben, it's a very big house
and you need somebody here.

326
00:32:57,821 --> 00:32:58,810
We're doing fine.

327
00:32:59,114 --> 00:33:01,230
I'm around the corner.
Call if you need me.

328
00:33:01,574 --> 00:33:02,689
I wIll, I promise.

329
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,986
-Okay. All right.
-Good night.

330
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,107
Ellie?

331
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:15,933
-My God.
-What happened?

332
00:33:16,588 --> 00:33:18,897
Just sit down.
I'll be out in a minute.

333
00:33:31,936 --> 00:33:34,928
-Ellie? You look--
-Like Mom.

334
00:33:38,692 --> 00:33:40,603
And that's Mom's dress.

335
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:46,734
Is it? Well, I'm surprised
how good it looks on you.

336
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:50,351
Would you llke some wine?

337
00:33:51,121 --> 00:33:54,113
Wine? Oh, yeah.

338
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:58,731
-I want wine.
-You look a llttle underage to me.

339
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,809
Very funny. Ha, ha.

340
00:34:15,977 --> 00:34:17,251
Karen.

341
00:34:20,315 --> 00:34:23,466
-Karen.
-Dad?

342
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:38,866
Wait! You forgot your lunch.

343
00:34:43,086 --> 00:34:46,601
-Thanks.
-What do you want for dinner tonight?

344
00:34:48,675 --> 00:34:49,903
I don't know.

345
00:34:50,176 --> 00:34:53,213
Mrs. Potter can get us
some steaks or something.

346
00:34:53,554 --> 00:34:56,830
WIll you please go back inside?
Right now.

347
00:34:57,934 --> 00:35:00,004
Ellie, come on! Jesus.

348
00:35:18,536 --> 00:35:21,004
Is your name Ben Christianson?

349
00:35:21,331 --> 00:35:22,320
Yes.

350
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,020
Do you llve in Europe?

351
00:35:25,543 --> 00:35:26,532
No.

352
00:35:28,295 --> 00:35:31,731
Are you employed by Matrix Systems?

353
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:33,121
Yes.

354
00:35:33,384 --> 00:35:36,057
Did you kill your wife?

355
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:37,577
No.

356
00:35:37,888 --> 00:35:40,641
Are you a college graduate?

357
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:42,505
Yes.

358
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:46,043
Are you employed by Matrix Systems?

359
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:47,590
Yes.

360
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:51,314
Is your name Ben Christianson?

361
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:53,011
Yes.

362
00:35:54,362 --> 00:35:57,399
Did you bludgeon your wife to death?

363
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,855
No.

364
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:05,422
I gotta tell you, I was nervous.
Very nervous.

365
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:10,309
The machine supposedly
takes that into account.

366
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,261
There's something else.

367
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,900
I didn't kill my wife.

368
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,239
I may have wanted her dead,
but I didn't do it.

369
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,274
I didn't kill her.

370
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,898
We're not accusing you.

371
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:28,379
Wait in the hallway.
I'll be out in a minute.

372
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,498
Relax.

373
00:36:38,111 --> 00:36:40,102
He's telling the truth.

374
00:36:40,488 --> 00:36:42,365
According to Poly here.

375
00:37:04,177 --> 00:37:07,169
-What?
-Yeah, well....

376
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:14,468
-You're stIll getting over your mom.
-What do you want?

377
00:37:14,854 --> 00:37:19,291
I'm a llttle concerned about
what I see going on around here.

378
00:37:19,692 --> 00:37:22,604
It's not right to leave
you girls all alone.

379
00:37:22,945 --> 00:37:25,539
Thank you,
but it's not your business.

380
00:37:27,407 --> 00:37:30,604
I llve right over there
if you need anything.

381
00:37:30,952 --> 00:37:33,466
What could I possibly want from you?

382
00:37:33,788 --> 00:37:35,824
Ellie, who's there?

383
00:37:36,124 --> 00:37:39,958
Just Loser-- I mean, Lawson.
He was saying good night.

384
00:37:40,545 --> 00:37:41,534
Night.

385
00:37:47,802 --> 00:37:50,362
Why did you say you would marry me?

386
00:37:51,305 --> 00:37:53,102
When did I say that?

387
00:37:54,308 --> 00:37:58,017
You said if it wasn't for Karen,
you'd marry me.

388
00:37:59,896 --> 00:38:04,048
-I know, and I wIll, but not now.
-When?

389
00:38:05,527 --> 00:38:09,725
-When this whole thing blows over.
-And when does it blow over?

390
00:38:10,114 --> 00:38:13,470
If I don't get my green card,
I have to leave.

391
00:38:13,826 --> 00:38:16,215
Can't you see how it would look?

392
00:38:19,123 --> 00:38:21,637
Fine. Fuck you!

393
00:38:31,968 --> 00:38:33,526
Another one, please.

394
00:38:53,071 --> 00:38:56,825
Where were you? I was worried sick.

395
00:38:58,868 --> 00:39:02,065
I was out. Out and about.

396
00:39:02,497 --> 00:39:06,809
You didn't call. I didn't know
if I should call the pollce.

397
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:09,201
Well, I'm okay, okay?

398
00:39:10,963 --> 00:39:14,717
-I smell llquor. You been drinking?
-Yeah, what of it?

399
00:39:15,092 --> 00:39:18,129
I'll ask you one more time!
Where were you?

400
00:39:18,554 --> 00:39:21,068
I'm tired and I want to go to bed.

401
00:39:22,808 --> 00:39:26,164
-I waited up all night for you.
-Get off my ass!

402
00:40:26,282 --> 00:40:28,432
Having a hard time sleeping?

403
00:40:34,456 --> 00:40:36,765
Are you trying to get away from me?

404
00:40:45,508 --> 00:40:48,227
You were really mean to me tonight.

405
00:40:49,637 --> 00:40:52,276
Well, you were really mean to me too.

406
00:40:52,598 --> 00:40:56,477
-What about this morning?
-You were in that skimpy thing.

407
00:40:56,852 --> 00:40:58,490
I mean, fuck you!

408
00:40:59,688 --> 00:41:03,601
What do you want from me? Do I
have to do everything around here?

409
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,985
Do we have to argue llke this?

410
00:41:22,084 --> 00:41:23,517
I don't know.

411
00:41:31,885 --> 00:41:35,924
I was talking to Mrs. Potter today
about the new alarm system.

412
00:41:36,473 --> 00:41:38,304
-Dad!
-What?

413
00:41:39,684 --> 00:41:44,041
I just don't know what goes on
inside your head sometimes.

414
00:41:51,737 --> 00:41:54,126
It's just been a tough period.

415
00:41:56,533 --> 00:41:58,125
Same here.

416
00:42:02,372 --> 00:42:05,170
I was really worried
about you tonight.

417
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,974
Yeah, maybe I should have called.

418
00:42:13,257 --> 00:42:15,817
It's only because I care about you.

419
00:42:19,555 --> 00:42:21,671
I care about you too.

420
00:42:25,978 --> 00:42:30,130
Remember when I was llttle,
you'd kiss me llke I was a movie star?

421
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,959
Gee, that was a whlle ago.

422
00:42:36,362 --> 00:42:40,150
-I remember it.
-You must have been 4 or 5.

423
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:51,411
I'd lean back and you'd kiss me
llke Rudolph Valentino.

424
00:43:03,304 --> 00:43:04,657
Kiss me.

425
00:43:34,207 --> 00:43:35,720
I'll make the coffee.

426
00:43:38,086 --> 00:43:39,485
Sure.

427
00:43:47,303 --> 00:43:49,055
Hey! Wait up!

428
00:43:50,473 --> 00:43:52,031
Your lunch?

429
00:43:52,308 --> 00:43:54,344
Well. Thanks.

430
00:43:55,352 --> 00:43:57,388
I missed you last night.

431
00:44:01,733 --> 00:44:04,645
-I should've called.
-You'll be home tonight?

432
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:06,798
Of course.

433
00:44:07,906 --> 00:44:11,296
-Tell Ellie we'll have a dinner guest.
-Who?

434
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:15,288
-Let's make it a surprise, okay?
-Okay.

435
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,569
Bye, sweetie.

436
00:44:36,975 --> 00:44:41,890
It's probably somebody very important,
llke a coworker or something.

437
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:46,101
-What kind of coworker?
-Somebody very important.

438
00:44:47,109 --> 00:44:50,306
You know, Dad might be up
for a promotion.

439
00:44:50,946 --> 00:44:54,541
If he doesn't get it,
it won't be because of this meal.

440
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:02,503
Inger! Ellie! I'm home!

441
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,783
Here, let me take your coat.

442
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,718
It's not a coworker, it's Lena.

443
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:14,939
-Lena!
-Hi!

444
00:45:17,221 --> 00:45:20,531
Ellie? Do I smell smoke?

445
00:45:33,069 --> 00:45:37,187
-Isn't this just dellcious?
-It's wonderful.

446
00:45:37,573 --> 00:45:39,564
You cook this yourself, Ellie?

447
00:45:40,326 --> 00:45:41,839
Yes, I did.

448
00:45:45,206 --> 00:45:49,165
You look lovely. You look
more llke your mother every day.

449
00:45:49,543 --> 00:45:52,103
No, everybody says
I look llke my father.

450
00:45:52,421 --> 00:45:56,733
-I look nothing llke my mother.
-She's wearing Mom's dress.

451
00:45:58,218 --> 00:46:03,008
I thought I recognized that dress.
Oh, that's so cute.

452
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:07,246
When I was llttle,
I used to play dress-up too.

453
00:46:07,602 --> 00:46:11,595
-It's not dress-up. It fits.
-I know, dear.

454
00:46:12,857 --> 00:46:17,214
Wait, hold on. You applled
a llttle too much blush there.

455
00:46:19,905 --> 00:46:22,499
There. That's much better.

456
00:46:31,332 --> 00:46:34,642
-What's going on?
-Can't I have Lena over for dinner?

457
00:46:35,002 --> 00:46:38,358
Yes, but not as a guest.
What are you thinking?

458
00:46:38,714 --> 00:46:40,272
Is this a problem?

459
00:46:41,592 --> 00:46:46,188
If it isn't a problem, why did you
spring her on me llke that?

460
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:51,496
-I'm so tired. I'll call a cab.
-I'll drive you.

461
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:55,090
-I have a cab company's number.
-I'll drive you.

462
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:59,147
-It's okay. I'll call a cab.
-That won't be necessary.

463
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,411
I'll be back in a bit.

464
00:47:44,232 --> 00:47:48,350
-Aren't you coming to bed?
-I'm just waiting for Dad to get home.

465
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:55,315
Okay. Good night.

466
00:47:56,952 --> 00:47:58,067
Good night.

467
00:48:14,761 --> 00:48:17,992
-Dad?
-Ellie? Are you still up?

468
00:48:18,348 --> 00:48:19,747
Where are you?

469
00:48:20,224 --> 00:48:23,296
I'm over at Lena's.
I had some car trouble...

470
00:48:23,644 --> 00:48:27,353
...so I'm gonna have to stay over
here tonight. Honey?

471
00:48:27,773 --> 00:48:31,812
-Ellie?
-The Audi was fine this morning.

472
00:48:32,194 --> 00:48:34,708
I know. Funny, isn't it?

473
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:37,805
Yeah. A real fucking riot.

474
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:41,074
Please, don't use language like that.

475
00:48:41,453 --> 00:48:42,568
Lena?

476
00:48:42,829 --> 00:48:45,548
I just picked up
the other extension...

477
00:48:45,873 --> 00:48:49,070
... to say how happy I was
to see you tonight.

478
00:48:50,253 --> 00:48:52,244
I didn't hear you pick up.

479
00:48:52,546 --> 00:48:56,778
-And the meal was scrumptious.
-So lock up and go to bed.

480
00:48:57,926 --> 00:49:00,565
-Be back tomorrow. Good night.
-But--

481
00:50:49,907 --> 00:50:52,137
I haven't gotten to the good part yet.

482
00:50:53,118 --> 00:50:56,269
-What?
-Sam McGee was from Tennessee.

483
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:12,072
Oh, tell me that story
when you were in school.

484
00:51:42,414 --> 00:51:45,770
-The one in the kitchen.
-We were in a restaurant.

485
00:51:47,628 --> 00:51:49,664
That dessert was great, honey.

486
00:51:51,298 --> 00:51:53,607
Expecting more car trouble tonight?

487
00:51:55,176 --> 00:51:59,215
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Just cut the crap, okay?

488
00:52:01,265 --> 00:52:04,416
Inger, could you come in here, please?

489
00:52:05,645 --> 00:52:08,603
Lena and I are going
to stay up for a whlle.

490
00:52:08,939 --> 00:52:12,932
It'd be best if you two slept
in your own beds tonight.

491
00:52:13,318 --> 00:52:15,912
-Is that okay with you?
-Sure.

492
00:52:21,117 --> 00:52:26,032
-He didn't ask me if it was okay.
-You're old enough to sleep alone.

493
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:44,976
Hi, Lena.

494
00:53:45,905 --> 00:53:47,304
Hi.

495
00:53:47,949 --> 00:53:51,180
-Thirsty?
-That's right. I came down for water.

496
00:53:51,536 --> 00:53:52,935
Want mine?

497
00:53:54,413 --> 00:53:55,607
No, thanks.

498
00:53:55,873 --> 00:53:58,910
Why not? You're thirsty.

499
00:53:59,293 --> 00:54:01,409
You want it, so take it.

500
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,148
Thanks.

501
00:54:05,215 --> 00:54:06,694
Drink it.

502
00:54:08,093 --> 00:54:10,209
Oh, if you insist.

503
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:17,898
It's not as if
I poisoned it or anything.

504
00:54:23,274 --> 00:54:27,028
But you're looking at me, expecting
me to drop dead, aren't you?

505
00:54:32,157 --> 00:54:34,591
Relax, Ellie. I'm just joking.

506
00:54:35,661 --> 00:54:38,175
Let's turn the llght on the situation.

507
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:45,530
Look, I know how you feel
about your father.

508
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,993
I understand, because I felt
the same way about my father.

509
00:54:50,716 --> 00:54:53,753
I even dreamed about marrying him.

510
00:54:54,595 --> 00:54:56,904
Of course, that's not possible.

511
00:54:58,349 --> 00:55:03,139
Look, Ellie. One day you'll find
someone you'll be attracted to...

512
00:55:03,603 --> 00:55:08,074
...and you'll have sex with him
and maybe even fall in love.

513
00:55:08,608 --> 00:55:12,044
-Oh, really?
-Yes. Just llke your father and l.

514
00:55:13,696 --> 00:55:16,688
-Lena?
-In here, sweetheart!

515
00:55:21,203 --> 00:55:23,000
What are you two doing up?

516
00:55:23,414 --> 00:55:27,487
Just quenching our thirst,
and enjoying a llttle girl talk.

517
00:55:28,877 --> 00:55:33,314
After you're done, get to bed.
You've got school tomorrow.

518
00:55:33,924 --> 00:55:35,516
Good night, Ellie.

519
00:56:02,532 --> 00:56:06,081
-You're looking good today, Sasquatch.
-Thanks.

520
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:22,145
Ellie was in school
the day her mother died.

521
00:56:22,759 --> 00:56:25,910
-How do you know?
-The attendance records.

522
00:56:27,806 --> 00:56:31,765
-And the rest of the day?
-I could check with each teacher.

523
00:56:32,185 --> 00:56:34,699
Would you? I'd appreciate it.

524
00:56:35,062 --> 00:56:38,134
Here's my number.
Just call me. Thank you.

525
00:56:38,524 --> 00:56:42,676
Now that Lena's been over a few times,
we were both wondering...

526
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:44,662
...what do you guys think?

527
00:56:45,781 --> 00:56:49,933
About Lena and I seeing each other,
and her coming over?

528
00:56:50,368 --> 00:56:55,396
-You guys are getting married?
-I told you that's what they'd think.

529
00:56:55,832 --> 00:56:59,381
We want you to know
that nobody is marrying anybody.

530
00:56:59,752 --> 00:57:03,222
-That's right.
-But you are getting married?

531
00:57:03,673 --> 00:57:05,391
Ben, speak to her.

532
00:57:06,425 --> 00:57:08,700
We're not rushing into anything.

533
00:57:09,094 --> 00:57:12,131
Sometimes grownups
need other grownups.

534
00:57:12,973 --> 00:57:16,170
Your father loved
your mother very much.

535
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:20,689
-We're not thinking of marriage now.
-What are we thinking?

536
00:57:21,064 --> 00:57:24,022
We're just spending
some time together.

537
00:57:24,734 --> 00:57:28,568
Do you, Ben Christianson,
take Lena Anderson...

538
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:31,104
...to be your lawful wedded wife?

539
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:34,956
To have and to hold,
to love and to cherish...

540
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:39,684
...in sickness and in health,
for richer, for poorer....

541
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,503
I didn't tell him how
you were my favourite.

542
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:53,921
I didn't tell him how
you were my favourite.

543
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:57,413
You were my favourite....
Favourite....

544
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,352
TIll death do you part.

545
00:58:05,147 --> 00:58:06,705
I do.

546
01:00:31,992 --> 01:00:35,109
-Detective Boland.
-Why don't you call me James?

547
01:00:36,538 --> 01:00:40,167
-You sure sing pretty, Amaryllis.
-Thank you.

548
01:00:42,836 --> 01:00:46,909
-Are you off duty or on duty?
-I'm looking for Ellie. You seen her?

549
01:00:47,298 --> 01:00:50,768
The Blue Hawallans
wish Ben and Lena the best...

550
01:00:51,135 --> 01:00:53,888
...on their wedding day.
Let's go, boys.

551
01:00:56,557 --> 01:00:58,912
Hey! You all right?

552
01:00:59,894 --> 01:01:04,649
-Jesus! You all right?
-Lawson? What the hell?

553
01:01:10,695 --> 01:01:14,290
Usually when I come out here,
it's totally quiet.

554
01:01:17,452 --> 01:01:21,206
Shit. Tonight,
there's nothing but noise.

555
01:01:21,581 --> 01:01:24,493
You should go. There's free beer.

556
01:01:25,418 --> 01:01:26,931
You're wasted.

557
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:30,901
I had one drink for the toast.

558
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:32,989
Stand up.

559
01:01:36,136 --> 01:01:37,535
Close your eyes.

560
01:01:39,264 --> 01:01:41,255
Why? Do you want to kiss me?

561
01:01:43,059 --> 01:01:44,811
Just close your eyes.

562
01:01:46,479 --> 01:01:47,992
You sure she's here?

563
01:01:48,272 --> 01:01:52,629
She's here. You know, I did
see her drinking earller.

564
01:01:53,194 --> 01:01:57,426
-Maybe she's in the ladies' room.
-Can you check it out for me?

565
01:01:58,282 --> 01:02:00,750
-Yeah. Sure.
-Thanks.

566
01:02:01,076 --> 01:02:05,945
-I'm hopping!
-Now recite the alphabet backwards.

567
01:02:06,706 --> 01:02:09,778
Z. It starts with "Z." Come on!

568
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:11,957
Z...

569
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:14,206
...Y....

570
01:02:14,505 --> 01:02:17,303
-Wait a minute.
-Just one drink? Right.

571
01:02:25,266 --> 01:02:29,339
I think that I have to go
wash up somewhere.

572
01:02:32,522 --> 01:02:33,875
We can go to my place.

573
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:40,973
Can we run away?

574
01:03:42,964 --> 01:03:44,636
We can leave right now.

575
01:03:47,009 --> 01:03:48,965
-Ellie!
-Ellie?

576
01:03:49,261 --> 01:03:51,377
Let's look in Ellie's room.

577
01:03:53,182 --> 01:03:55,138
I'll check in the back.

578
01:04:58,908 --> 01:05:00,023
Whoa.

579
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:07,160
We don't have a lot of money, right?
So we just llve off the land.

580
01:05:08,834 --> 01:05:12,190
Use the National Parks.
Sleep under the stars.

581
01:05:12,546 --> 01:05:15,822
I'm good with my hands.
I could be a day labourer.

582
01:05:16,174 --> 01:05:19,723
I'll make just enough to get us
to the next place.

583
01:05:20,970 --> 01:05:22,323
I don't know.

584
01:05:24,432 --> 01:05:28,584
If we go, I don't want to be a gypsy.
We should settle down.

585
01:05:29,395 --> 01:05:32,705
-Where?
-How about up north? Like Portland?

586
01:05:33,065 --> 01:05:36,421
We can get a really cheap
and broken-down old house.

587
01:05:36,777 --> 01:05:41,771
-You don't want that. Let's travel.
-We could start a bed-and-breakfast.

588
01:05:42,199 --> 01:05:44,394
I could receive the guests.

589
01:05:44,701 --> 01:05:49,729
Make sure their towels are clean.
I can cook too. I'm a great cook.

590
01:05:50,164 --> 01:05:54,157
You can be the handyman.
Do the plumbing and carpentry--

591
01:05:54,544 --> 01:05:57,263
-But, it costs money.
-Hardly any.

592
01:05:57,588 --> 01:06:01,376
-She wouldn't run away.
-Wedding night? Yes, she would.

593
01:06:01,759 --> 01:06:05,991
She always talked of running away.
She had the suitcase--

594
01:06:07,306 --> 01:06:08,625
Wait a minute.

595
01:06:09,641 --> 01:06:13,600
The most important thing
is that we leave tomorrow.

596
01:06:13,979 --> 01:06:16,971
Okay. Just turn off the llghts.

597
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:27,257
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
Did you see Ellie's suitcase?

598
01:06:31,161 --> 01:06:32,594
Thank God.

599
01:06:34,289 --> 01:06:36,723
Her suitcase is here.

600
01:06:54,141 --> 01:06:55,540
Fuck!

601
01:06:56,268 --> 01:06:57,826
It's Boland.

602
01:07:01,648 --> 01:07:04,640
Don't worry. I can handle this clown.

603
01:07:09,155 --> 01:07:11,066
-Mr. Smith.
-What's up?

604
01:07:11,408 --> 01:07:15,083
-We're looking for Ellie Christianson.
-What for?

605
01:07:15,495 --> 01:07:20,410
-She's been missing since the wedding.
-I'm real sorry about that, Ben.

606
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:23,108
-Have you seen her?
-No.

607
01:07:24,336 --> 01:07:27,851
-You mind if I look around?
-Yeah, I do mind.

608
01:07:28,215 --> 01:07:29,728
Why's that?

609
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:34,070
Why do you think she'd be with me?

610
01:07:34,387 --> 01:07:37,618
That's not what we're suggesting,
you bastard.

611
01:07:37,974 --> 01:07:40,932
That is exactly
what you're suggesting.

612
01:07:41,269 --> 01:07:43,624
-Look, you son of a bitch!
-Whoa!

613
01:07:43,938 --> 01:07:46,327
-Goddamn it!
-Easy, Ben.

614
01:07:46,649 --> 01:07:49,288
Hold it. I can't fight both of you.

615
01:07:50,027 --> 01:07:54,737
-I can get a warrant in 30 minutes.
-Well, get your fucking warrant!

616
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,439
Ellie.

617
01:08:02,956 --> 01:08:04,355
It's open.

618
01:08:08,628 --> 01:08:10,778
Everything's okay.

619
01:08:13,216 --> 01:08:15,013
Okay, I should go home.

620
01:08:15,343 --> 01:08:19,859
Home? What's stopping us
from leaving right now?

621
01:08:20,347 --> 01:08:23,862
-I have to get my clothes, don't l?
-Not really.

622
01:08:24,518 --> 01:08:27,430
You gonna buy me new ones,
Mr. Moneybags?

623
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:32,378
I gotta go.

624
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:38,232
Listen, we'll leave
at 8 in the morning.

625
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:40,856
Okay.

626
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:45,806
Eight o'clock.

627
01:08:56,214 --> 01:08:59,206
Yeah, that's Smith.
As in "Smithsonian."

628
01:09:07,141 --> 01:09:08,369
Ellie.

629
01:09:09,101 --> 01:09:10,853
What happened?

630
01:09:27,285 --> 01:09:30,994
Well, young lady.
Where have you been?

631
01:09:31,748 --> 01:09:35,946
-Been looking all over for you.
-We can handle it from here.

632
01:09:36,335 --> 01:09:39,054
You don't mind,
I'd llke to talk to your daughter.

633
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:41,336
-It's late.
-I know it is.

634
01:09:41,632 --> 01:09:44,192
-We're all awake.
-She needs sleep.

635
01:09:47,221 --> 01:09:49,052
Absolutely not.

636
01:10:06,197 --> 01:10:08,347
-You gotta talk to her.
-I wIll.

637
01:10:08,657 --> 01:10:12,855
Ben, talk to her now.
Remember what we discussed.

638
01:10:13,245 --> 01:10:15,440
Be gentle, but firm.

639
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:20,089
Be loving, but tell her
this behaviour won't be tolerated.

640
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:23,020
-You're right.
-It's not my place.

641
01:10:23,797 --> 01:10:25,389
Not yet. It's yours.

642
01:10:30,136 --> 01:10:31,808
So go talk to her now.

643
01:10:40,854 --> 01:10:42,810
Where were you all night?

644
01:10:46,026 --> 01:10:48,620
Lena and I are disappointed in you.

645
01:10:50,238 --> 01:10:51,990
We were worried sick.

646
01:10:54,117 --> 01:10:56,551
That isn't important right now,
I guess.

647
01:10:58,663 --> 01:11:01,939
I'm glad you're safe,
but I must say this to you:

648
01:11:03,876 --> 01:11:06,310
We won't tolerate this behaviour.

649
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:11,339
When you're 1 8, you're on your own.
But you're under my roof now.

650
01:11:11,758 --> 01:11:13,077
You got it?

651
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:18,499
You got it?

652
01:11:21,226 --> 01:11:23,865
WIll you say something, for chrissake?

653
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:30,508
Go downstairs now and apologize
to Lena for getting drunk.

654
01:11:30,901 --> 01:11:34,052
I know you got drunk.
Mrs. Potter told me.

655
01:11:35,322 --> 01:11:38,075
Go downstairs and say you're sorry...

656
01:11:38,408 --> 01:11:41,161
...and you hope we have
a nice honeymoon.

657
01:11:43,038 --> 01:11:45,757
Go downstairs right now and say it!

658
01:11:56,968 --> 01:11:58,117
I won't say that.

659
01:12:01,138 --> 01:12:03,493
-You won't?
-No.

660
01:12:04,931 --> 01:12:08,446
I'll tell her you have
a mole on your left ass-cheek.

661
01:12:11,521 --> 01:12:12,920
I wIll.

662
01:12:13,648 --> 01:12:15,604
-You can't.
-I'll tell her.

663
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:17,811
Please. Please.

664
01:12:18,653 --> 01:12:20,052
Everything.

665
01:12:20,738 --> 01:12:22,535
Everything!

666
01:12:41,591 --> 01:12:42,944
You're so...

667
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:45,659
...weak.

668
01:12:49,473 --> 01:12:51,464
What do you want from me?

669
01:12:52,059 --> 01:12:56,098
I don't understand.
When did you decide this? Right now?

670
01:12:57,272 --> 01:13:01,788
No, not right now. I've thought
about it for quite a whlle.

671
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:06,350
-We've only been married 12 hours!
-Then I've thought for 12 hours.

672
01:13:06,739 --> 01:13:08,570
It's not going to work out.

673
01:13:10,076 --> 01:13:12,909
You're not even wIIllng
to give us a try?

674
01:13:15,331 --> 01:13:19,449
I think I've given it all I had.
And I think I made a mistake.

675
01:13:20,628 --> 01:13:24,746
You made a mistake.
You made a mis-- Fuck!

676
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,160
What happened with Lena?

677
01:13:39,812 --> 01:13:42,963
She went to Mrs. Potter's.
We'll talk later.

678
01:13:43,357 --> 01:13:45,871
So Lena left? That's too bad.

679
01:13:46,235 --> 01:13:48,795
I didn't get to say goodbye.

680
01:13:51,073 --> 01:13:53,189
I guess I should go to work.

681
01:13:53,909 --> 01:13:57,504
No use wasting vacation days
if there's no honeymoon.

682
01:13:57,871 --> 01:13:59,862
You two better get to school.

683
01:14:00,874 --> 01:14:03,183
I won't be going to school today.

684
01:14:04,919 --> 01:14:08,753
Well, then. You better get to school.

685
01:14:11,801 --> 01:14:14,269
-Well?
-Well?

686
01:14:14,637 --> 01:14:16,753
I asked you first.

687
01:14:19,808 --> 01:14:22,561
First, Mom. Now Lena.

688
01:14:22,894 --> 01:14:25,454
I guess Dad's unlucky in love.

689
01:14:26,523 --> 01:14:28,036
What have you done?

690
01:14:33,529 --> 01:14:35,326
I'm going to school.

691
01:14:37,116 --> 01:14:39,869
You don't have to leave
for a half hour.

692
01:14:51,088 --> 01:14:54,478
-It's Lawson.
-I know who it is. What do you want?

693
01:14:56,092 --> 01:14:59,528
-It's 7:45 and I'm ready to roll.
-I'm not going.

694
01:14:59,888 --> 01:15:02,960
What are you talking about?
We had plans to go.

695
01:15:03,307 --> 01:15:05,298
We talked about it, that's all.

696
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:08,195
Ellie, listen.
You've got to listen!

697
01:15:13,233 --> 01:15:15,189
-Hi, honey.
-Lena?

698
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:17,442
Hi, lnger.

699
01:15:19,072 --> 01:15:22,382
I'll leave you two alone
for a few minutes.

700
01:15:24,911 --> 01:15:27,823
We never got a chance
to say goodbye, did we?

701
01:15:28,915 --> 01:15:31,987
We could play untll the bus comes.

702
01:15:32,335 --> 01:15:36,123
Inger, I'm not in the mood right now.

703
01:15:38,007 --> 01:15:40,123
You could put makeup on me.

704
01:15:47,015 --> 01:15:50,530
Look at me, please?
Go to the window and look at me.

705
01:15:56,983 --> 01:15:59,133
I've thought about it, okay?

706
01:15:59,569 --> 01:16:02,402
Screw my dumb plan
of travelling around.

707
01:16:03,406 --> 01:16:08,002
Let's open a bed-and-breakfast
in Portland. I like the idea.

708
01:16:08,409 --> 01:16:11,845
-You have no money.
-But I'm good with my hands.

709
01:16:13,998 --> 01:16:18,037
Come on, Ellie, it's a great idea.
A bed-and-breakfast!

710
01:16:19,503 --> 01:16:21,255
You gotta control yourself.

711
01:16:22,297 --> 01:16:23,525
I love you!

712
01:16:27,802 --> 01:16:31,590
-Who knows when we'll see each other?
-Soon, I hope.

713
01:16:32,432 --> 01:16:33,990
-Bye.
-Bye.

714
01:16:39,647 --> 01:16:42,400
Inger just left,
so we won't need three mugs.

715
01:16:43,109 --> 01:16:47,819
Oh, I should've told you this a llttle
earller. It's not for lnger.

716
01:16:50,282 --> 01:16:54,036
Lena, you say anything
and I'll arrest you.

717
01:18:33,712 --> 01:18:35,145
Lawson?

718
01:18:46,474 --> 01:18:47,589
Hello?

719
01:19:00,654 --> 01:19:04,727
We have an alarm system, you know.
And you've probably set it off.

720
01:20:07,759 --> 01:20:09,192
Hello?

721
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:16,139
It's Amtek. There's been a break-in
at the Christiansons'.

722
01:22:37,606 --> 01:22:41,315
-I'm here if you need me. Call me.
-I wIll.

723
01:22:44,238 --> 01:22:47,992
-You guys, you should move back.
-Of course, sure.

724
01:23:04,423 --> 01:23:05,617
Lawson.

725
01:23:06,175 --> 01:23:07,893
Your first hunch.

726
01:23:08,385 --> 01:23:10,501
Too bad he didn't have a weapon.

727
01:23:10,804 --> 01:23:13,272
Internal Affairs
wIll have a field day.

728
01:23:13,682 --> 01:23:16,401
Probably won't affect your retirement.

729
01:23:22,607 --> 01:23:26,566
-How about some cocoa?
-I never touch the stuff.

730
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:31,043
Come with me.

731
01:23:44,503 --> 01:23:45,856
Where's lnger?

732
01:23:46,755 --> 01:23:48,552
Dad?

733
01:23:52,051 --> 01:23:53,769
Yeah, go to her.

734
01:23:56,973 --> 01:23:58,372
Sweetie, I'm here.

735
01:24:00,267 --> 01:24:04,385
-I don't want to go back.
-We're not. We're gonna stay here.

736
01:24:07,024 --> 01:24:09,492
There'll never be another like her.
I loved her.

737
01:24:10,193 --> 01:24:13,708
Is she really dead?

738
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:18,792
She's dead.
