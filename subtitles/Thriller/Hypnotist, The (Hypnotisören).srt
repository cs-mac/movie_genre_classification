Jump! Come on, red team. The same again. The whole team up!

2
00:01:52,956 --> 00:01:56,541
And then the ball is in! Well! Good work!

3
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:17,457
We got a call about a possible homicide in Ekbackens sports.

If you stick along the blue line is in order.

00:03:14,997 --> 00:03:20,663
We've found more damage after a sharp weapon.

00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:24,039
A knife or something similar.

12
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:45,912

00:04:10,746 --> 00:04:15,412
Got it. The ambulance is about 5-10 minutes. Switch.

19
00:04:26,995 --> 00:04:29,494
- Did you alert? - Yes.

20
00:04:29,578 --> 00:04:33,495
Joona Linna, Rikskrim. I was nearby. Is it here?

21
00:04:33,578 --> 00:04:37,162
Are you okay? What is it that has happened?

22
00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:42,119
I saw that there was something that did not vote ... It is quite sick.

23
00:04:42,202 --> 00:04:45,161
The ambulance is on the way.

24
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,660
I go out and meet them.

25
00:06:27,284 --> 00:06:29,660
What the hell ...?!

26
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:47,659
Knife Stabbed, unconscious, breathing, low blood pressure: 60

27
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:51,491
High pulse, no heartbeat on the left side.

28
00:06:51,574 --> 00:06:54,699
- Who are you? - Joona Linna, police.

29
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:56,408
Wait here.

30
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:01,699
So, I'm ready for intubation. Connect Ringer's acetate.

31
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:09,823
Take BAS test and determine blood type.

32
00:07:12,908 --> 00:07:18,990
Hi, Joseph. I'll light your eyes. It is not dangerous.

33
00:07:25,241 --> 00:07:28,657
- We continue treatment. - Absolutely.

34
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:35,490
- You have to wait. - How is his condition?

35
00:07:35,574 --> 00:07:40,447
- Serious. He is doing might not. - I must speak with him.

36
00:07:40,532 --> 00:07:44,615
- He can not talk. - Let me try, will not you?

37
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:48,865
His entire family has been killed. Mother, father, sister.

38
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:52,072
Impossible. The boy can not communicate.

39
00:07:52,157 --> 00:07:57,240
You can buy snacks if you want to wait. I'll take care of a patient.

40
00:08:12,489 --> 00:08:16,947
Hey, Magdalena. I'm sorry to call so late, but it's crisis.

41
00:08:19,947 --> 00:08:25,696
Yes, there is a witness. A boy, but he can not be heard ...

42
00:08:27,822 --> 00:08:30,989
I do not even know if he survives.

43
00:08:31,072 --> 00:08:35,572
In the end, we have technical evidence, but no witnesses.

44
00:08:35,656 --> 00:08:38,489
Find out what you can and come. Okay?

45
00:08:39,571 --> 00:08:44,071
- Maybe there's a way. - Moment. I have to finish. Yes?

46
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:47,406
Maybe there's a way.

47
00:08:51,613 --> 00:08:53,571
Erik?

48
00:08:54,613 --> 00:08:58,280
Erik. It rings.

49
00:09:09,488 --> 00:09:10,780
Eric!

50
00:09:11,989 --> 00:09:15,862
- I can talk to him. - Okay.

51
00:09:15,945 --> 00:09:20,445
- Reply now. - Erik Maria Bark.

52
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:25,280
This is Deputy Police Inspector Joona Linna. I'm calling from Danderyd hospital.

53
00:09:25,362 --> 00:09:28,696
- What is it about? - A badly injured patient.

54
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:33,696
- Who is the doctor on duty? - Daniella Richards.

55
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:42,320
Why ... why call her? One moment. We do like this ...

56
00:09:42,404 --> 00:09:46,862
- I enter. - Okay. Great. Thank you.

57
00:09:46,945 --> 00:09:50,069
Tell that to her.

58
00:09:55,237 --> 00:09:59,611
- Who was that? - The ... A policeman.

59
00:09:59,695 --> 00:10:02,403
- Policeman? - Deputy Police Commissioner of the EU.

60
00:10:02,486 --> 00:10:06,194
What happened?

61
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:11,444
A boy who ... they wanted me to look at. A wounded boy.

62
00:10:13,694 --> 00:10:17,694
I'm going in there. Damn!

63
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:30,610
I come afterwards.

64
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,985
Erik?

65
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:45,027
You forgot your phone.

66
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:49,443
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

67
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:52,277
Go back to bed.

68
00:10:58,652 --> 00:11:02,526
- I'm sorry, honey. - What the hell are you doing?

69
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:07,152
Yeah, what the hell are we doing?

70
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:17,442
- Come to me, if anything. - And pain relief is the same?

71
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:20,527
- Hello. - Hello.

72
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:23,484
Thank you for coming.

73
00:11:23,568 --> 00:11:26,734
Here's Joona Linna from the police.

74
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:31,652
- Well, you could make it. Coffee? - No thanks.

75
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:37,568
- Was it you who called? - Yes. So you're a specialist in. ..

76
00:11:37,651 --> 00:11:41,692
Akuttrauma. Erik is the best in the area.

77
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:45,984
I had a patient that I should look at.

78
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:48,191
Come on.

79
00:11:51,027 --> 00:11:53,776
It's okay. He is also a doctor.

80
00:11:56,526 --> 00:11:59,027
Sorry.

81
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:06,984
- What's his name? - Joseph.

82
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:24,441
Joseph? My name is Erik.

83
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:31,691
If you feel my hand, then press it.

84
00:12:43,191 --> 00:12:49,649
My rating is the same as Daniellas. There is no contact.

85
00:12:49,733 --> 00:12:53,982
You said that there is ... other methods.

86
00:12:55,024 --> 00:13:00,316
What other methods, Joona? What other methods?

87
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,440
Hypnosis.

88
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:07,815
He asked if there was any method.

89
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:15,774
- You know that I can not. Not? - Yes.

90
00:13:16,981 --> 00:13:18,607
Erik?

91
00:13:22,774 --> 00:13:26,315
Eric! Erik, wait!

92
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,439
- Hello, Magdalena. - Hello.

93
00:13:29,524 --> 00:13:35,024
They stood in registered. The father was a compulsive gambler.

94
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:38,481
I give it to the Stockholm police.

95
00:13:38,565 --> 00:13:43,106
They can look at his father's entourage.

96
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,106
- Who leads the feasibility study? - No idea.

97
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:50,605
I do not think it is an internal showdown.

98
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:56,522
They will kill a whole family, and our only witness can not communicate.

99
00:13:56,606 --> 00:13:59,897
- There is also an older daughter. - What?

100
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:05,148
The social services were involved, when she was a teenager. She came into care.

101
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,522
- Has she got protection? - I think not.

102
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:11,898
I do not even have an address for her.

103
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:17,438
Wait, Erik! Wait!

104
00:14:18,397 --> 00:14:21,605
Erik? Erik!

105
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:29,230
There's a sister. The family has a daughter.

106
00:14:29,313 --> 00:14:33,397
Someone is out to get her and the boy probably know who it is.

107
00:14:33,481 --> 00:14:36,230
- I can not help you. - Yes.

108
00:14:36,313 --> 00:14:40,063
I know that you can get in touch with him.

109
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:44,313
- You can not. - Yes, it can. You can.

110
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:55,855
It does not work as you think. You reach only into his truth.

111
00:14:55,938 --> 00:15:02,020
His own, subjective memories. There is a risk that I affect him.

112
00:15:15,645 --> 00:15:21,354
He's a heck ability to get people to remember.

113
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:25,521
A little too well, was there anyone who did.

114
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:32,770
Can you feel my hand?

115
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,645
You can hear me.

116
00:15:41,729 --> 00:15:45,603
There is absolutely nothing to be afraid of.

117
00:15:45,687 --> 00:15:49,395
We can stop whenever you want.

118
00:15:58,103 --> 00:16:03,435
You lie on a rock. It is quite warm.

119
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,853
You are looking at the clouds.

120
00:16:07,936 --> 00:16:11,686
I sit in front of you.

121
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:15,603
I'm with you all the time.

122
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:23,228
We jump into the water.

123
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,853
We dive.

124
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:32,269
Now I count down from five -

125
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:38,894
- and for every number we sink deeper.

126
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:47,561
And feel a greater and greater peace.

127
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:54,809
Five ...

128
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:58,018
... four ...

129
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,810
... three ...

130
00:17:03,184 --> 00:17:06,351
... two ...

131
00:17:06,434 --> 00:17:09,144
... a.

132
00:17:13,892 --> 00:17:17,143
Now we're at home.

133
00:17:18,393 --> 00:17:21,018
What's going on?

134
00:17:28,017 --> 00:17:31,142
sofa ...

135
00:17:31,226 --> 00:17:33,559
sofa.

136
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:38,808
I'm sitting on the couch.

137
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:46,225
What happens on the sofa?

138
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:49,392
I read the letter.

139
00:17:49,475 --> 00:17:52,683
What is this letter?

140
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:55,975
This is my letter.

141
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:59,183
Are you alone?

142
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:08,599
Lisa sitting next to me. The knocking on the door.

143
00:18:08,682 --> 00:18:11,307
What do you do?

144
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,183
Joseph. Joseph, listen to me. It's alright.

145
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:25,182
I count up to five, and five wake you. One, two, three -

146
00:18:25,267 --> 00:18:28,974
- four, five.

147
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:34,016
Quiet.

148
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:39,974
We must continue.

149
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:53,181
The boy must be constantly monitored.

150
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:56,266
- It's arranged. - And the sea ... Sorry.

151
00:18:56,348 --> 00:19:00,182
- Hello? - We need to find the sister.

152
00:19:32,015 --> 00:19:35,098
Did you take sleeping pills?

153
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,890
No.

154
00:19:45,347 --> 00:19:49,139
I promised not to.

155
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:55,472
I know that you save them in aftershave bin. You have taken four.

156
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:04,221
I'm sorry.

157
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,430
Why do you keep?

158
00:20:11,472 --> 00:20:17,054
- To be able to sleep. - Sofa from what?

159
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:36,679
Say what you will, but I think it's about gambling debts.

160
00:20:36,763 --> 00:20:41,180
Hell, no. I think it is a planned series of murders.

161
00:20:41,263 --> 00:20:45,137
You'll make it, so you can take action.

162
00:20:45,221 --> 00:20:49,929
I was there, Carlos. I saw both crime scenes, right?

163
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:55,429
There was one that would kill the whole family. Planned, organized -

164
00:20:55,512 --> 00:20:59,679
- and almost complete. The man in the sports hall was killed first.

165
00:20:59,764 --> 00:21:04,678
First the man, then on to the town house, where he continued the family.

166
00:21:04,762 --> 00:21:09,387
He managed almost. And there is one who tries to destroy the whole family -

167
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:13,387
- so he finds his daughter. Maybe it happened. Or the boy.

168
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:17,845
It is urgent. I know it's Christmas time, but we must take hold of this.

169
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:21,720
Stockholm police will even take care of it here.

170
00:21:21,803 --> 00:21:28,637
They can go on with playing the debt, but let me examine the other track.

171
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:35,094
The man was killed first. The needle will agree with me when the autopsy is complete.

172
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,928
Yes, yes.

173
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:45,261
Okay. Until we have clarified the order, you must do as you will.

174
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:50,720
- So I start. Will I Magdalena? - Now you surprise me.

175
00:21:50,802 --> 00:21:54,761
- Okay, but no more. - Fine.

176
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:12,136
I'm running Benjamin in school.

177
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,760
What happened to the bus?

178
00:22:14,844 --> 00:22:18,761
I'll take him. I must nevertheless the road. Why?

179
00:22:20,551 --> 00:22:22,927
Good.

180
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,593
I'll see you later.

181
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,469
Goodbye ...

182
00:22:33,135 --> 00:22:35,761
Come on, Benjamin!

183
00:22:43,094 --> 00:22:47,093
Why fight you and mom so much?

184
00:22:47,176 --> 00:22:51,217
- Do you think we do it? - Yes.

185
00:22:59,176 --> 00:23:03,842
We have to stop. That's not good.

186
00:23:10,842 --> 00:23:14,468
- You're still single, what? - Yes, why?

187
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:20,009
As soon as I call, you of course. At any time of day.

188
00:23:20,093 --> 00:23:23,967
- Every day, always. - But only when you call.

189
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:28,842
You were right. The man in the sports hall died first.

190
00:23:28,925 --> 00:23:32,634
- Are you sending the report ...? - I have spoken with Carlos.

191
00:23:32,717 --> 00:23:36,758
- I should say hello. The case is yours. - Thank you.

192
00:23:36,842 --> 00:23:43,549
Well, see here. To push such a broad leaf through bone and muscle tissue -

193
00:23:43,634 --> 00:23:49,966
- is difficult, even for a muscle mountain, but these connectors are not deep.

194
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:55,883
- And? - It's one that had to strain.

195
00:23:58,383 --> 00:24:01,924
- What was the cop who called? - What?

196
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:07,674
- The policeman who called last night. - I can not remember.

197
00:24:07,758 --> 00:24:11,549
What was his name? I do not know. Why?

198
00:24:11,634 --> 00:24:14,383
- That you bother. - What?

199
00:24:14,466 --> 00:24:20,383
- That you bother to go on. - What is it now?

200
00:24:20,466 --> 00:24:26,173
A policeman rang, I ran into the hospital, there was a wounded boy.

201
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:29,340
Okay.

202
00:24:32,423 --> 00:24:36,132
It says Daniella on display. Do you know that?

203
00:24:40,507 --> 00:24:46,007
- Do you think it was Daniella? - It is of course on the display.

204
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:49,840
- He called from her phone. - Okay. Good.

205
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:56,047
Call. Here. Okay, he was calling from her phone. Talk.

206
00:24:56,131 --> 00:24:58,422
- No. - Ask yourself.

207
00:24:58,506 --> 00:25:02,757
I will not talk to him. Hold up. It does not matter.

208
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:06,297
- That means a lot. - I believe in you.

209
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:11,382
There's nothing with Daniella. That was two years ago. Let it go, move on.

210
00:25:11,464 --> 00:25:16,547
She works at the hospital and I was there.

211
00:25:16,631 --> 00:25:20,464
Okay. Okay.

212
00:25:41,297 --> 00:25:45,964
This one sister can not just have disappeared. Or what?

213
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:52,130
Magdalena? Evelyn must have a phone that can be traced, a workplace -

214
00:25:52,214 --> 00:25:55,714
- or a student. Friends who know her.

215
00:25:55,796 --> 00:26:00,464
- Where is she last seen? - No traces. Not yet.

216
00:26:00,547 --> 00:26:04,880
It's as if she does not want to be found.

217
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,171
Okay.

218
00:26:07,256 --> 00:26:11,671
During the night knock on the door, and Joseph go out and shut up.

219
00:26:11,755 --> 00:26:18,295
That we assume. Blow on, he said that under hypnosis. We are not in court.

220
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:23,462
A person puts the whole family down and walks away.

221
00:26:23,545 --> 00:26:27,963
- And we have no DNA traces. - Technicians certain blood.

222
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:32,088
sister, mother and Joseph's home and the father of basketball hall.

223
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:37,462
No other DNA traces, no fingerprints, nothing.

224
00:26:40,754 --> 00:26:46,130
Wait a minute ... Joseph said that he had read a letter.

225
00:26:46,212 --> 00:26:51,962
- Is there found something like that? - I think not.

226
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:56,004
You can just hold for today. I have to do something.

227
00:26:56,087 --> 00:26:59,170
See if your child can still recognize you.

228
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:29,166
- Police! - Police! Add the weapon!

229
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:33,165
- Lie down! - I lie down.

230
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:37,416
- I'm colleague ... - Look left!

231
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,833
I'm a cop. My id is located in the left pocket. Relax.

232
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:50,499
Joona Linna. Rikskrim? What the hell are you doing here?

233
00:29:53,749 --> 00:29:55,874
What is it?

234
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:06,374
Who has packed it away? It's a mess.

235
00:30:08,832 --> 00:30:11,624
- We had so fine ... - What?

236
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:17,457
I do not know how ... They are gone. You have packed it so sloppy together ...

237
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:21,499
- I've packed it sloppy? - Yes.

238
00:30:22,749 --> 00:30:26,956
- It was me who packed all together? - Yes. It was indeed.

239
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,915
- Shut up. - It was indeed.

240
00:30:29,998 --> 00:30:35,332
Let it now endangered. I said I was sorry. I'm sorry.

241
00:30:35,415 --> 00:30:38,998
By that I discovered it?

242
00:30:41,748 --> 00:30:47,623
It's two years ago. You just keep digging in it.

243
00:30:47,707 --> 00:30:51,498
- It does not matter. - Of course it does.

244
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:55,915
It does not matter. You understand it really is not.

245
00:30:55,998 --> 00:31:02,749
Every time it rings every time you get mail or letter, I get scared.

246
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:06,123
I've really tried. Every day I try.

247
00:31:06,206 --> 00:31:11,123
Every day I try, but I do not have confidence.

248
00:31:11,206 --> 00:31:14,748
I do not trust you.

249
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:30,623
- You know, the neighbors called the. - I had done exactly the same.

250
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:35,497
- Nice to meet you. - You too. Goodbye.

251
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,121
- Hello? - Magdalena? I found the letter.

252
00:31:58,205 --> 00:32:03,580
- What letter? - The letter, Joseph talked about. Listen.

253
00:32:03,663 --> 00:32:08,163
"""You are my flesh and blood, but the family will die."""

254
00:32:08,246 --> 00:32:12,246
"""First, when it happens, it may be, as it should be."""

255
00:32:12,329 --> 00:32:17,995
- What? I can not hear. - Were you afraid of Santa Claus?

256
00:32:20,203 --> 00:32:27,121
- Joona, we must take it in the morning. - Okay, we'll rest tomorrow.

257
00:32:27,204 --> 00:32:30,828
- Okay. Hey. - Hello.

258
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:51,911
- May I come in? - What does it mean if I say no?

259
00:32:51,994 --> 00:32:56,162
It makes a lot. For me.

260
00:33:03,244 --> 00:33:07,245
- Is it good, what ...? - It's funny.

261
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:12,203
- It does not look funny. - But that's it.

262
00:33:12,285 --> 00:33:18,035
You look not so happy when you play.

263
00:33:26,995 --> 00:33:31,494
I love you.

264
00:33:31,578 --> 00:33:37,577
I do of course. You have to say it. Whatever it is, as you say it.

265
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:43,744
If something is difficult or there is something you are worried about.

266
00:33:43,827 --> 00:33:49,034
- Anything. - Shut up.

267
00:33:50,244 --> 00:33:53,452
Benjamin. Shall I give you the syringe tonight?

268
00:33:53,535 --> 00:33:57,369
No, father to do it.

269
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:01,410
Okay. Okay.

270
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:06,744
Okay.

271
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:39,409
Hello.

272
00:34:45,993 --> 00:34:48,618
Hello.

273
00:34:52,908 --> 00:34:55,741
- Good night. - Good night.

274
00:35:02,243 --> 00:35:05,909
- Here you go. - Thank you.

275
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,576
There's something I have to tell you.

276
00:35:14,658 --> 00:35:18,742
I can not bear more charges.

277
00:35:19,783 --> 00:35:24,657
- I orcs not. - It's not accusations.

278
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,617
Well.

279
00:35:31,658 --> 00:35:33,616
What is it?

280
00:35:36,157 --> 00:35:40,282
I will take a break.

281
00:35:45,866 --> 00:35:48,782
Break?

282
00:35:52,616 --> 00:35:59,866
I will take a break ... from ...

283
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:04,907
- From what? Are you going to cry? - No.

284
00:36:04,991 --> 00:36:10,073
- What do you take a break from? - From Us! From you and me.

285
00:36:12,198 --> 00:36:15,866
- Pause? - Yes.

286
00:36:18,906 --> 00:36:21,823
From us, from you and me.

287
00:36:29,656 --> 00:36:32,656
A while.

288
00:37:04,864 --> 00:37:09,615
- What do you pause? - Not now.

289
00:37:14,529 --> 00:37:18,614
- What do you think? - Tomorrow.

290
00:37:24,529 --> 00:37:28,947
- How many did you take? - Yes ... No ...

291
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:36,029
Go back to sleep on the couch. I can not stand to see you like that.

292
00:37:36,113 --> 00:37:40,654
I will not see you like this. Lie on the couch.

293
00:37:41,696 --> 00:37:45,363
- Erik? - Yes, yes ...

294
00:40:25,985 --> 00:40:27,775
Erik?

295
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:34,317
Erik?

296
00:40:52,858 --> 00:40:55,109
Erik?

297
00:41:01,733 --> 00:41:03,942
Erik.

298
00:41:14,566 --> 00:41:17,109
Eric!

299
00:41:26,316 --> 00:41:28,148
Dad!

300
00:41:30,148 --> 00:41:34,066
Hello? Hello?

301
00:41:37,649 --> 00:41:40,649
Eric, there is one that ...

302
00:41:52,066 --> 00:41:57,273
"""Dear child, I have long looked at you -"

303
00:41:59,732 --> 00:42:02,898
"- and hate what you've become."""

304
00:42:02,982 --> 00:42:08,232
"""Dear child,"" suggests suppose that it is one that is older. Not?"

305
00:42:08,315 --> 00:42:13,523
"- It goes without saying. - ""I have long looked at you."""

306
00:42:13,607 --> 00:42:17,981
Yes, as if someone has persecuted the child.

307
00:42:18,065 --> 00:42:22,106
Something tells me that this is not the first contact.

308
00:42:22,189 --> 00:42:24,939
At the same time they do not know each other.

309
00:42:25,023 --> 00:42:28,565
And do not include themselves in the family.

310
00:42:28,648 --> 00:42:34,772
"And ""for everything to be as it should be."" What does it mean?"

311
00:42:34,855 --> 00:42:37,857
- psychopath ... - Moomintroll ...

312
00:42:41,521 --> 00:42:45,565
- Now I'm getting tired of you! - What a nonsense.

313
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:49,022
So so. Petter, you have a moment? Come on.

314
00:42:49,107 --> 00:42:52,147
- There was daddy. - Is the letter studied?

315
00:42:52,231 --> 00:42:57,606
- Yes. - No fingerprints, in addition to Joseph.

316
00:42:57,689 --> 00:43:02,063
What bothers me is that we have ...

317
00:43:02,147 --> 00:43:07,063
We have two executions two different locations with respect to each other.

318
00:43:07,147 --> 00:43:12,605
There are no fingerprints, no DNA. It works incredibly professional.

319
00:43:12,688 --> 00:43:17,021
- But Needle says it is ... - Amateurish.

320
00:43:17,105 --> 00:43:20,396
So we're back at the start.

321
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,605
We have to analyze the crime scene again, testing the letter a second time -

322
00:43:25,688 --> 00:43:31,230
- contact relatives and try to find her sister.

323
00:44:10,395 --> 00:44:12,561
Simone?

324
00:44:13,604 --> 00:44:18,603
Simone? Simone! Simone!

325
00:44:27,437 --> 00:44:33,103
An ambulance to Barn_ngsgatan 34th My wife has fainted.

326
00:44:34,395 --> 00:44:36,936
- Well ... - What is it?

327
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:42,561
This is embarrassing, Joona. My goodness. Absolutely incredible.

328
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:50,311
"""Scandal Doctor in the police service."""

329
00:44:52,186 --> 00:44:57,060
- It is urgent to get the boy to talk. - It does not hold up in court.

330
00:44:57,144 --> 00:45:01,936
- That brings us perhaps beyond. - Has it done so far?

331
00:45:02,019 --> 00:45:05,228
- Express rang. - What did you say to them?

332
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:09,978
I told them to go to hell. If this works for you, you are the man of -

333
00:45:10,061 --> 00:45:13,894
- but it strikes mistake, banks Janne Josefsson at the door.

334
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:18,978
- They found her sister. - Good. We'll see.

335
00:45:23,227 --> 00:45:27,352
"What do you mean by ""still not ...""?"

336
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:34,935
What do you mean that he is not in school?

337
00:45:37,311 --> 00:45:41,102
Have ... Has not he been in. ..?

338
00:45:43,935 --> 00:45:47,517
- Honey ... Beloved, hey. - Hello.

339
00:45:47,601 --> 00:45:52,392
You're in the hospital. Relax. You are in the hospital.

340
00:45:52,477 --> 00:45:56,602
It'll be all right. Take it easy, take it easy.

341
00:45:56,683 --> 00:45:59,267
Hello. Simone?

342
00:45:59,351 --> 00:46:02,726
Erik ... Erik, how ...?

343
00:46:02,809 --> 00:46:07,016
Benjamin is with you, right?

344
00:46:07,101 --> 00:46:12,641
- Benjamin is not in school. - Simone? Simone?

345
00:46:13,975 --> 00:46:16,517
Where is Benjamin?

346
00:46:17,516 --> 00:46:19,892
- Stay there. - I must go ...

347
00:46:19,975 --> 00:46:23,601
- It's not me ... - Lie down. I'll fix it.

348
00:46:23,684 --> 00:46:27,433
We have to wait to talk about it here.

349
00:46:27,516 --> 00:46:33,266
They gave me an injection and took Benjamin! They have taken our little boy!

350
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:37,184
- Simone! - I have to help Benjamin!

351
00:46:37,266 --> 00:46:43,350
- Where? When? Wait, wait. - While we slept! We must help our ...

352
00:46:57,058 --> 00:47:01,100
Benjamin! Benjamin!

353
00:47:02,682 --> 00:47:06,350
- Benjamin! - I'm going upstairs.

354
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,266
Benjamin!

355
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:30,432
No, no, no ... No! No! No!

356
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:35,515
No, not Benjamin.

357
00:47:38,265 --> 00:47:43,224
He's not here. I must think.

358
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,680
Simone ...

359
00:48:25,138 --> 00:48:31,806
You have to remember it. What is it that has happened?

360
00:48:38,305 --> 00:48:42,888
I place you in the room 333rd

361
00:48:46,138 --> 00:48:52,222
It's not luxury, but it is safe.

362
00:49:04,512 --> 00:49:09,305
Hello. Rikskrim. Is this where Evelyn Ek ...?

363
00:49:09,388 --> 00:49:15,471
Do you want something that banks simply on the door, and then we open for you. Okay?

364
00:49:21,346 --> 00:49:23,596
Evelyn?

365
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:28,972
Hello. My name is Joona. I come from Rikskriminalen.

366
00:49:30,013 --> 00:49:34,137
I'd like to talk with you.

367
00:49:39,262 --> 00:49:45,637
Do you have any idea who might have done this?

368
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:50,262
Someone who has threatened you or something like that?

369
00:49:50,346 --> 00:49:53,720
You can tell me. No one can reach you.

370
00:49:53,804 --> 00:49:59,179
You know nothing. You do not know anything. You can not protect me.

371
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:02,220
He will find me.

372
00:50:02,303 --> 00:50:06,386
Who? Who are you? Evelyn, who?

373
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:12,220
- I'm going back now. - Evelyn. Who?

374
00:50:17,261 --> 00:50:21,928
He suffers from hemophilia. Haemophilia Disease.

375
00:50:22,011 --> 00:50:26,095
- Okay. - So he gets syringes regularly.

376
00:50:27,136 --> 00:50:31,303
And what happens if he does not get syringes?

377
00:50:31,386 --> 00:50:35,678
Yes, because he suffers from haemophilia -

378
00:50:35,761 --> 00:50:41,469
- so he risks getting bleeding which of course can ...

379
00:50:43,261 --> 00:50:50,510
Simone, you do not remember anything, but you know that someone took Benjamin?

380
00:50:50,594 --> 00:50:54,052
- Yes. - We can not get it to vote.

381
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:59,302
When I was asleep, there was one in and gave me a numbing spray.

382
00:50:59,385 --> 00:51:02,384
- What We Believe. - I know.

383
00:51:02,469 --> 00:51:08,344
I tried to wake Erik. I heard Benjamin try to call me -

384
00:51:08,427 --> 00:51:14,051
- but I was so far away that I ...

385
00:51:14,134 --> 00:51:18,384
We interrupt straight. You say that you tried to wake Erik?

386
00:51:18,468 --> 00:51:22,926
Okay. Do you sleep poorly, Erik?

387
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:26,718
Yes. I have trouble sleeping. So I take ...

388
00:51:26,802 --> 00:51:33,134
He's very strong sleeping pills. It was impossible to wake him.

389
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:37,301
What's the last thing you remember before you close your eyes?

390
00:51:37,384 --> 00:51:41,759
That Benjamin tried to call me. It's as if ...

391
00:51:41,844 --> 00:51:46,676
It's so hard to explain. It is like that which is in the head.

392
00:51:46,758 --> 00:51:51,634
- How was the cry of Benjamin? - He was scared.

393
00:51:51,718 --> 00:51:55,633
You heard the fear in his voice, and so did you react?

394
00:51:55,718 --> 00:51:59,968
Yes. That's why I wanted to ...

395
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:06,882
It's so hard to sit and waffle. Can not we ...? Someone took Benjamin.

396
00:52:06,967 --> 00:52:10,800
What do we know? We must look, right?

397
00:52:10,883 --> 00:52:14,592
- We must lead, and not waffle. - It is not nonsense ...

398
00:52:14,676 --> 00:52:20,550
We sit and logs. It is so strange to us because he is our child.

399
00:52:20,632 --> 00:52:23,758
The phone.

400
00:52:27,383 --> 00:52:31,133
- Bark. - Hello, Eric. It is Shulman.

401
00:52:31,216 --> 00:52:35,967
Do you know where Simone is? She had to make some paintings.

402
00:52:36,049 --> 00:52:40,550
- Hello? - Would not you stop by the gallery?

403
00:52:40,632 --> 00:52:45,216
- Where are you? - Home.

404
00:52:46,841 --> 00:52:50,257
How about Benjamin?

405
00:52:51,299 --> 00:52:55,549
- Not something that ...? - No, it was a gallerist.

406
00:52:55,633 --> 00:52:59,257
- My wife picturesque images. - Okay.

407
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:05,340
Benjamin is gone. It is such a nightmare.

408
00:53:05,424 --> 00:53:09,049
There are police officers here who wants to talk to us, and ...

409
00:53:09,132 --> 00:53:13,298
What do you say? What did you say something?

410
00:53:13,382 --> 00:53:17,381
What is it that has happened?

411
00:53:18,382 --> 00:53:21,173
Hello?

412
00:53:21,257 --> 00:53:23,673
Simone!

413
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:28,715
Hello?

414
00:53:34,299 --> 00:53:37,423
NO MORE HYPNOSIS

415
00:53:42,423 --> 00:53:46,130
- What happened here? - Rikskrim? What do you think?

416
00:53:46,215 --> 00:53:50,548
- Talk to Erik. What happened? - A boy has been abducted.

417
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:53,465
Here?

418
00:53:55,381 --> 00:53:59,630
Here. We have to eat something.

419
00:53:59,715 --> 00:54:04,130
Want to order takeaway? Are you crazy?

420
00:54:04,214 --> 00:54:08,464
- Just look at them. - Are you crazy?

421
00:54:28,297 --> 00:54:32,963
Are you okay? Are you all right, Eric?

422
00:54:33,047 --> 00:54:38,588
Good. I do not think that the family Ex killer has something to do with it here to do.

423
00:54:38,672 --> 00:54:41,879
- It is on the wall. - You must not hypnotize.

424
00:54:41,964 --> 00:54:47,964
It could be anyone. One who does not want you to start again.

425
00:54:49,922 --> 00:54:52,547
Who could it be?

426
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:03,421
- No old enemies? Think about it. - I do not know.

427
00:55:09,129 --> 00:55:11,170
Okay.

428
00:55:11,254 --> 00:55:17,004
Let us assume that it is as you think.

429
00:55:17,087 --> 00:55:21,128
That it has a direct connection to the murder of the family Ek.

430
00:55:21,213 --> 00:55:26,962
So there's only one man who can give us information.

431
00:55:27,045 --> 00:55:31,712
And we need your help. Can you ...?

432
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:36,002
Wait. What can I do? What is it that I can?

433
00:55:36,087 --> 00:55:38,962
Talk to Joseph.

434
00:55:39,045 --> 00:55:43,128
You want me to use hypnosis on Joseph?

435
00:55:43,212 --> 00:55:47,212
You want me to solve your murder?

436
00:55:47,294 --> 00:55:53,753
It's our only option. We are stuck in this investigation.

437
00:55:54,795 --> 00:55:59,711
If I see that boy again ...

438
00:56:01,712 --> 00:56:04,544
So would the killer know about it, and ...

439
00:56:04,628 --> 00:56:09,127
- He is not out of it. - It is of course in the newspaper!

440
00:56:09,212 --> 00:56:13,128
Journalists call me up in the middle of the night!

441
00:56:13,212 --> 00:56:16,461
It was a mistake. It will not happen again.

442
00:56:16,545 --> 00:56:21,002
- It's your fault! It's your fault. - Now we hold for today.

443
00:56:26,753 --> 00:56:30,460
- Okay. I will contact you. - Goodbye.

444
00:56:51,293 --> 00:56:55,626
Why do not you do something? What?

445
00:56:55,710 --> 00:57:00,210
- Why do not you do something? - Right now we are waiting requirements.

446
00:57:00,293 --> 00:57:05,251
The requirements are they on the wall in my studio. Can not you read?

447
00:57:05,336 --> 00:57:10,001
- We are doing everything we can. - Okay. Well so.

448
00:57:10,085 --> 00:57:14,251
So we're in good hands. Good.

449
00:57:16,418 --> 00:57:22,543
- Do you want coffee? - Do you have tea?

450
00:57:25,085 --> 00:57:29,584
What the hell ...? Should I sit here and drink tea?

451
00:57:29,668 --> 00:57:33,585
Eric, dammit. They're a couple of idiots.

452
00:57:33,668 --> 00:57:38,251
Shall I sit here and drink tea?! And read the newspaper?!

453
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:20,916
How's he doing without his medication?

454
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:24,834
He's strong.

455
00:58:24,916 --> 00:58:27,708
Does he have pain?

456
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:33,165
He'll be fine. You know that.

457
00:58:35,873 --> 00:58:38,915
Yes.

458
00:58:45,083 --> 00:58:48,749
We must do something. We can not just sit here.

459
00:58:48,833 --> 00:58:51,832
The police are doing what they can. They help us.

460
00:58:51,916 --> 00:58:58,582
Nobody does anything. We sit here and do nothing. Nobody does anything.

461
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:07,582
They're working on it. They do.

462
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:23,372
The police ask a lot of questions. They might as well put it bluntly.

463
00:59:23,457 --> 00:59:28,581
- What? - They think that we have done it.

464
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:45,039
- Do you have children? - No.

465
00:59:50,206 --> 00:59:54,039
So you can not understand how it feels.

466
01:00:01,746 --> 01:00:06,538
- You asked me if I had an enemy. - Yes.

467
01:00:11,289 --> 01:00:15,038
There's one.

468
01:00:18,455 --> 01:00:21,746
Hello. We are looking Evert Braun.

469
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:27,371
- Do you know where we can find him? - He's in the overhead crane.

470
01:00:37,913 --> 01:00:42,620
Let me handle this. Wait here.

471
01:00:59,205 --> 01:01:01,870
- Hello. - Hello.

472
01:01:01,954 --> 01:01:06,370
- Are you Evert Braun? - Am I Evert Braun? Yes.

473
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:10,037
My name is Joona Linna and is from Rikskrim.

474
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:17,245
- I will ask you a few questions. - Rikskrim? Yes, sir. Like.

475
01:01:17,329 --> 01:01:23,787
- Where were you the night to yesterday? - At work here as always. Why?

476
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:26,120
- All night? - Yes.

477
01:01:26,203 --> 01:01:30,120
Shift work? Can you confirm any of this?

478
01:01:30,203 --> 01:01:35,953
- Ask anyone in the workshop. - Did you take my son?

479
01:01:37,036 --> 01:01:42,703
- Benjamin. Have you been ...? - Erik, now let me handle this!

480
01:01:42,785 --> 01:01:45,244
What the hell is he doing here?

481
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:53,786
Have I taken your son from you? How dare you show up here?!

482
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:58,369
You've ruined my life, you fucking bitch!

483
01:01:58,454 --> 01:02:01,453
Damn, damn pigs.

484
01:02:01,536 --> 01:02:05,994
Are you aware of what a rumor can do? Can you believe it?

485
01:02:06,077 --> 01:02:08,827
To Hell no.

486
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:13,952
So you come here and claim that I have taken your son!

487
01:02:15,328 --> 01:02:18,453
I'm sorry. Sorry.

488
01:02:20,743 --> 01:02:24,368
Okay. That's it.

489
01:02:37,077 --> 01:02:40,076
I led a research project.

490
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:44,993
One of the subjects was Evert Braun.

491
01:02:45,077 --> 01:02:50,368
He told about the abuse of children.

492
01:02:50,452 --> 01:02:53,451
- Sexual assault. - Well, damn.

493
01:02:53,535 --> 01:02:58,493
I told the police that initiated a feasibility study -

494
01:02:58,577 --> 01:03:03,160
- and laid it on the grounds that I had planted evidence.

495
01:03:03,242 --> 01:03:08,534
That I had given them images that were not theirs, to build memories.

496
01:03:08,617 --> 01:03:12,533
That I had asked leading questions. I ...

497
01:03:16,201 --> 01:03:21,533
So I was removed from my research -

498
01:03:21,617 --> 01:03:26,116
- and the newspapers wrote about it, and it was ...

499
01:03:29,825 --> 01:03:34,701
- Because of a mistake. - Yes.

500
01:03:37,116 --> 01:03:43,034
I do not ... I destroyed a man's life.

501
01:04:09,783 --> 01:04:14,783
It's not him. He knows nothing.

502
01:04:18,158 --> 01:04:21,408
Nobody knows anything.

503
01:05:32,072 --> 01:05:35,989
- A hard day? - Hello.

504
01:05:36,073 --> 01:05:40,072
Yes. It could say that.

505
01:05:41,113 --> 01:05:44,155
A doctor who smokes?

506
01:05:47,239 --> 01:05:53,947
- As if you never go through a red light. - No, I have never ... No.

507
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:58,197
- Have you eaten? - No.

508
01:05:58,279 --> 01:06:01,238
Come on. I give.

509
01:06:14,947 --> 01:06:17,405
Hello.

510
01:06:29,071 --> 01:06:32,821
Joseph? Can you hear me?

511
01:06:46,904 --> 01:06:50,945
You speak so good Swedish.

512
01:06:51,029 --> 01:06:55,362
- Thank you. You too. - Thank you.

513
01:07:00,945 --> 01:07:06,403
- What is it? You look like ... - No ...

514
01:07:06,486 --> 01:07:13,486
- Work. Never mind that. - Maybe it's just something you forgot?

515
01:07:13,569 --> 01:07:17,445
I do not usually forget. I have a good memory.

516
01:07:17,528 --> 01:07:21,028
What color are my eyes?

517
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:29,028
- You have blond hair. - Yes.

518
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:34,152
- And a white shirt, right? - Yes, that's right.

519
01:07:34,235 --> 01:07:40,444
One gold jewelery. A heart and a small gold drop.

520
01:07:40,527 --> 01:07:47,485
Your eyes are ... They are gray, but in bright light may appear blue.

521
01:07:52,653 --> 01:07:54,319
Good.

522
01:07:54,402 --> 01:08:01,068
And you have black leather boots on.

523
01:08:01,152 --> 01:08:03,318
- Yes. - Is there anything else?

524
01:08:03,402 --> 01:08:06,527
No, that's plenty.

525
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:11,235
Wait. His feet ...

526
01:08:11,318 --> 01:08:14,943
His feet were dirty. There's something I need to check.

527
01:08:15,027 --> 01:08:17,569
Sorry, Daniella. We'll see.

528
01:08:18,609 --> 01:08:21,944
... two a.

529
01:08:23,693 --> 01:08:27,651
Joseph? Breathe.

530
01:08:29,984 --> 01:08:33,068
Shall we try again?

531
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:38,651
Now it's evening.

532
01:08:40,817 --> 01:08:44,443
A piece away from you you see your home.

533
01:08:49,983 --> 01:08:53,317
You will go inside.

534
01:09:04,942 --> 01:09:08,608
Now we're at home.

535
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:16,108
What happens then?

536
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:23,899
I'm hiding in the dark.

537
01:09:25,525 --> 01:09:31,650
- Is there someone else? - Lisa.

538
01:09:32,817 --> 01:09:35,733
She comes running stairs.

539
01:09:37,942 --> 01:09:43,692
- What do you do? - Jager Lisa up the stairs.

540
01:09:43,774 --> 01:09:48,275
- What? - She cries.

541
01:09:48,357 --> 01:09:52,650
- What did you say? - She cries.

542
01:09:56,817 --> 01:10:01,483
Mother ... Mother must not hear it.

543
01:10:01,566 --> 01:10:03,982
Mom can hear me.

544
01:10:12,191 --> 01:10:14,608
I stick.

545
01:10:14,691 --> 01:10:17,274
I stick.

546
01:10:17,358 --> 01:10:21,399
Mother ... She screams.

547
01:11:22,397 --> 01:11:26,148
It's not ...

548
01:11:27,773 --> 01:11:32,356
- What do you do? - Going into the bathroom.

549
01:12:13,313 --> 01:12:19,020
- You met your father before? - Yes. Down in the sports hall.

550
01:12:27,229 --> 01:12:31,146
I just did as she said.

551
01:12:31,229 --> 01:12:35,771
As she said? Evelyn?

552
01:12:40,063 --> 01:12:44,187
- I need to do as she says. - Who? Evelyn?

553
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:49,687
I'm sorry. Sorry. I just did as she said.

554
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:56,436
Joseph ... Said Evelyn, you should do it?

555
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,895
My sister.

556
01:12:58,978 --> 01:13:02,562
Evelyn is my sister.

557
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:21,977
It's me, Eric. I'm in the hospital.

558
01:13:22,061 --> 01:13:25,851
I think that it is Joseph who is the murderer.

559
01:13:25,936 --> 01:13:29,686
- That must be the one who ... - I'm on my way there now.

560
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:33,811
- He has been up and walking around. - What?

561
01:13:33,894 --> 01:13:36,477
I'll be there in a minute.

562
01:13:49,352 --> 01:13:53,519
- I said it. - So, so.

563
01:13:53,601 --> 01:13:57,519
He wanted me to say it.

564
01:13:57,601 --> 01:14:03,351
Joona Linna here. Officer only in the hospital is not responding.

565
01:14:27,435 --> 01:14:32,309
Little Friend, can I help you? Where are you going?

566
01:14:34,392 --> 01:14:38,975
So. Can you stand alone? Arise.

567
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:46,268
That's it. Then we go back. There is not much. I'll get the other ...

568
01:15:12,475 --> 01:15:14,810
Where is he? Where is the boy?!

569
01:15:25,308 --> 01:15:28,183
Wait. Stop!

570
01:15:28,267 --> 01:15:31,016
Where is the boy?

571
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:19,098
- How are they? - She operated now. It is critical.

572
01:16:19,182 --> 01:16:22,181
Satan. Satan!

573
01:16:27,597 --> 01:16:34,682
Listen. We are looking forward. The guy can not have gone far. He's wounded.

574
01:16:39,014 --> 01:16:42,764
I think it's her sister. Evelyn.

575
01:16:42,847 --> 01:16:47,597
- As made him do all this. - Meat and blood, what?

576
01:16:47,681 --> 01:16:52,389
"Wait. ""You are my flesh and blood, but the family will die."""

577
01:16:52,473 --> 01:16:56,472
Evelyn wanted Joseph to kill his own family.

578
01:16:56,557 --> 01:16:57,973
Yes.

579
01:17:07,972 --> 01:17:12,347
Do you know that? It is you who have written it.

580
01:17:12,431 --> 01:17:15,555
Right?

581
01:17:17,431 --> 01:17:21,722
"""You are my flesh and blood, but the family will die."" Josef is your flesh and blood."

582
01:17:21,806 --> 01:17:28,055
You got him to kill your parents. And your little sister.

583
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:33,306
Was you with?

584
01:17:33,388 --> 01:17:36,556
Kept you the knife?

585
01:17:38,471 --> 01:17:41,846
I have not done anything.

586
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:47,972
We know that it was Joseph who did it. As killed them.

587
01:17:48,055 --> 01:17:52,013
He ran away from the hospital last night.

588
01:17:52,096 --> 01:17:58,346
He stabbed a nurse down. Her condition is critical.

589
01:17:58,430 --> 01:18:01,971
Has he been in contact with you?

590
01:18:02,054 --> 01:18:04,888
No.

591
01:18:06,013 --> 01:18:10,637
I've always felt that there would be something terrible.

592
01:18:10,721 --> 01:18:17,304
I've been afraid of him for life. I will not be afraid anymore.

593
01:18:17,388 --> 01:18:20,845
You do not know what he is for a man.

594
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:24,679
He was always laughing when people get hurt.

595
01:18:24,761 --> 01:18:28,345
He laughed when our last dog died.

596
01:18:28,429 --> 01:18:31,595
And it was only worse.

597
01:18:33,429 --> 01:18:36,888
- In what way? - Since the summer ...

598
01:18:36,969 --> 01:18:42,220
He was even more insane. He beat us.

599
01:18:42,304 --> 01:18:45,303
shouted that he hated us.

600
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:51,012
The mother and father had stolen him, and that they should give him back.

601
01:18:51,094 --> 01:18:56,136
- I will not be afraid anymore. - Why do you think he said that?

602
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:59,344
I do not know.

603
01:19:00,429 --> 01:19:03,678
I do not know.

604
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:27,886
How can you sit and eat? What? How can you sit and eat?

605
01:19:27,969 --> 01:19:32,219
Are you thinking only about food? What?

606
01:19:32,303 --> 01:19:39,302
Do you think ... Do you think that Benjamin is hungry?

607
01:19:39,386 --> 01:19:41,926
Did he ...?

608
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:46,509
But that's no matter, you just sit there and eat like a pig!

609
01:19:46,593 --> 01:19:51,926
You're the damn and stop food in his mouth like a pig!

610
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:18,925
He was even more insane. He beat us.

611
01:21:19,008 --> 01:21:22,007
shouted that he hated us.

612
01:21:22,091 --> 01:21:27,424
The mother and father had stolen him, and that they should give him back.

613
01:21:27,507 --> 01:21:34,174
The mother and father had stolen him, and that they should give him back.

614
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:50,007
- Hello. I tried to call. - Well, something has happened? Come in.

615
01:21:52,299 --> 01:21:56,131
- Josef is adopted. - Why do you think that?

616
01:21:56,215 --> 01:21:59,590
Because Evelyn today said ...

617
01:21:59,673 --> 01:22:04,131
- No, but what there is? - Mother!

618
01:22:04,215 --> 01:22:09,506
Evelyn said Joseph accused his parents of having stolen him.

619
01:22:09,589 --> 01:22:12,049
- Martin? - What the hell ...

620
01:22:18,506 --> 01:22:21,256
What did you say?

621
01:22:22,298 --> 01:22:27,923
It is clear that the letter was written from a parent to a child.

622
01:22:28,006 --> 01:22:30,005
Joseph?

623
01:22:30,089 --> 01:22:35,464
I think that the correct parent found him and contacted him.

624
01:22:35,547 --> 01:22:39,214
That he is up for adoption, and so should the parent ...

625
01:22:39,297 --> 01:22:44,005
... have come into contact with him. And have gotten him to do this.

626
01:22:44,089 --> 01:22:48,838
- Yes. - We gotta go. We should be safe.

627
01:22:48,923 --> 01:22:53,798
We must have an APB out. The person is now our prime suspect.

628
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:58,048
It might also have with Benjamin's disappearance to do.

629
01:22:58,130 --> 01:23:00,505
- So we have to go now. - Yes.

630
01:23:00,588 --> 01:23:03,380
I need to talk to Martin.

631
01:23:20,547 --> 01:23:25,922
"A new message. ""Hypnotist must die."""

632
01:24:12,336 --> 01:24:16,086
Joseph's biological mother named Lydia Evers.

633
01:24:16,171 --> 01:24:21,295
We did not know much about her. She has long been socially isolated.

634
01:24:21,378 --> 01:24:23,836
Thank you.

635
01:24:26,712 --> 01:24:32,795
10 years ago was Lydia sentenced to psychiatric treatment.

636
01:24:32,878 --> 01:24:37,253
And she was discharged six months ago.

637
01:24:37,336 --> 01:24:41,170
Six months ago ... But you know what it says here?

638
01:24:41,253 --> 01:24:46,711
Joseph was forcibly removed just before Lydia was hospitalized.

639
01:24:46,795 --> 01:24:51,461
So he was adopted by the family Ek. Do we have a photo?

640
01:24:53,294 --> 01:24:58,295
- Let's see what it says. - 99th It's 10 years old.

641
01:24:58,378 --> 01:25:02,711
- She may look completely different. - Yes, but she's been gone a long time.

642
01:25:10,877 --> 01:25:15,377
Hello. What is it that happens, Simone?

643
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:20,127
- Here's the picture. - Fine. But you must tell me about it.

644
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:46,960
"""I see you."""

645
01:26:08,918 --> 01:26:12,209
I CAN SEE YOU AND YOUR whore. SOON IS DEAD.

646
01:26:16,876 --> 01:26:21,958
Hello? There ... There is one that threatens my wife.

647
01:26:22,042 --> 01:26:29,168
- If it right now? - Yes. It's happening right now.

648
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:33,793
And then the third there. But there must be ... There is one, right?

649
01:26:33,876 --> 01:26:38,625
I've packed four into. I forgot it in the studio.

650
01:26:38,708 --> 01:26:41,041
- I'll get it. - Let me.

651
01:27:33,416 --> 01:27:37,291
Damn it! What the hell are you doing?

652
01:27:39,248 --> 01:27:42,080
Are you mad?!

653
01:27:53,998 --> 01:27:56,872
But ... What happens?

654
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:07,873
- Give space. - Well. Yes, yes ...

655
01:28:07,956 --> 01:28:12,290
- What happened? - A completely insane person.

656
01:28:12,373 --> 01:28:17,830
- He threw himself over me with a knife. - Simone. I heard it over the radio.

657
01:28:17,915 --> 01:28:22,664
- It was a little child! - I know. Where's Eric?

658
01:28:22,748 --> 01:28:27,997
- Where's Eric? - Who knows? Perhaps the hospital.

659
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:31,955
I know who took Benjamin. But do not know where she is.

660
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:35,165
- She? - I'll explain it later.

661
01:28:40,997 --> 01:28:45,039
Joseph? Do you hear me?

662
01:28:45,122 --> 01:28:51,164
Was that your real mother, who said that you should do this?

663
01:28:51,247 --> 01:28:53,371
Was that it?

664
01:28:55,747 --> 01:29:00,746
Lydia? Is this your real mother? What?

665
01:29:00,829 --> 01:29:05,413
- Where is she now? - I love her.

666
01:29:05,497 --> 01:29:08,996
- What did you say? - I love her.

667
01:29:09,079 --> 01:29:14,163
Yes. Where is she? I must find her. Josef?

668
01:29:15,204 --> 01:29:18,704
Damn!

669
01:29:39,746 --> 01:29:41,537
Eric!

670
01:29:41,621 --> 01:29:44,037
Hello! Are you okay?

671
01:29:54,579 --> 01:29:59,537
- How long will it take? - Lydia has no credit cards.

672
01:29:59,620 --> 01:30:04,411
No registered address, and the photo is both bad and old -

673
01:30:04,495 --> 01:30:07,745
- so it will take time.

674
01:30:22,577 --> 01:30:27,202
- Have you heard anything? - No. We are doing everything we can.

675
01:30:27,287 --> 01:30:31,203
We'll find her and Benjamin. Try to get some sleep.

676
01:30:33,994 --> 01:30:39,286
Yes, Erik, by the way. I checked him Evert Braun.

677
01:30:39,369 --> 01:30:43,327
He stood in the register. Feasibility Study Material.

678
01:30:43,411 --> 01:30:48,743
A few years ago they found evidence of child abuse.

679
01:30:49,786 --> 01:30:54,827
Unfortunately, not enough to prosecute, according to the prosecutor.

680
01:30:54,911 --> 01:30:59,868
But I think you should know.

681
01:31:04,368 --> 01:31:09,661
Would you like a cup of coffee or something?

682
01:31:09,744 --> 01:31:12,035
Why not?

683
01:31:15,785 --> 01:31:20,409
Unfortunately, there are a lot of cases where no indictment -

684
01:31:20,493 --> 01:31:25,368
- although the evidence is very strong.

685
01:31:30,118 --> 01:31:35,118
We can not do much other than wait now. Sorry.

686
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:37,785
- You want more? - No thanks.

687
01:31:37,868 --> 01:31:44,617
- I'm looking for Simone. - Yes. I will be sitting a little.

688
01:32:21,741 --> 01:32:27,658
That I can not remember it ... It's so weird.

689
01:32:27,742 --> 01:32:31,449
Why can not I remember?

690
01:32:37,074 --> 01:32:43,033
- What? - Because you were stunned.

691
01:32:46,533 --> 01:32:51,491
But it does look. Not?

692
01:32:51,574 --> 01:32:54,949
I saw ... Do the ... I can ...

693
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:05,949
Think ... Imagine if I saw anything?

694
01:33:07,241 --> 01:33:11,574
Erik? Help me.

695
01:33:15,323 --> 01:33:18,657
I think I saw something.

696
01:33:23,407 --> 01:33:27,032
- You must follow my instructions. - Okay.

697
01:33:27,116 --> 01:33:31,906
You should try to trust me. You must dare to relinquish control.

698
01:33:31,989 --> 01:33:37,032
- It stresses that you talk a lot. - Sit back.

699
01:33:37,115 --> 01:33:42,489
I know that you have a lot of thoughts and anxiety, but try to just breathe.

700
01:33:42,572 --> 01:33:46,990
Do not think so damn much. Okay?

701
01:33:47,072 --> 01:33:50,031
- No. - Relax.

702
01:33:50,114 --> 01:33:56,157
- I'm trying, Erik. - Here. Squeeze my hand in your hand.

703
01:33:56,239 --> 01:34:02,282
Press to. Close everything out of this deal. Close all your opponent out.

704
01:34:02,364 --> 01:34:06,990
Feel the pressure. Feel my hand, feel your hand.

705
01:34:07,071 --> 01:34:13,114
So let the other be and breathe with me. Let yourself sink.

706
01:34:13,196 --> 01:34:18,072
Relax. Sit back.

707
01:34:20,322 --> 01:34:22,406
Breathe.

708
01:34:23,447 --> 01:34:25,947
Close your eyes.

709
01:34:26,989 --> 01:34:30,030
Breathe with me.

710
01:34:43,738 --> 01:34:48,446
So. Stay here.

711
01:34:51,404 --> 01:34:55,321
And now you rely only on me.

712
01:34:55,405 --> 01:34:59,362
Does just me.

713
01:34:59,446 --> 01:35:03,613
For peace of the whole body.

714
01:35:10,695 --> 01:35:15,696
In a few moments, I lift your left hand.

715
01:35:15,779 --> 01:35:19,778
You let me do it. Now.

716
01:35:22,863 --> 01:35:26,320
In a moment I get rid your arm.

717
01:35:26,405 --> 01:35:29,654
It falls heavily into your lap.

718
01:35:29,737 --> 01:35:31,779
Now.

719
01:35:33,987 --> 01:35:38,904
I want you to imagine a meadow.

720
01:35:58,569 --> 01:36:04,778
There, a piece there, stands a house.

721
01:36:06,569 --> 01:36:10,111
It is our house.

722
01:37:05,401 --> 01:37:06,942
Erik?

723
01:37:07,026 --> 01:37:09,276
Eric!

724
01:37:10,692 --> 01:37:13,277
Erik?

725
01:37:23,984 --> 01:37:26,817
Do not sleep ...

726
01:37:39,525 --> 01:37:44,151
I can not. It turns black. I can not stand on their feet ...

727
01:37:44,233 --> 01:37:49,359
Listen to my voice. Go back to bed where you sleep -

728
01:37:49,442 --> 01:37:52,816
- and everything is in order.

729
01:37:53,858 --> 01:37:59,941
Now you lie in your bed ... and sleep.

730
01:38:03,524 --> 01:38:06,484
You feel a twinge.

731
01:38:10,275 --> 01:38:14,150
Is anyone there?

732
01:38:15,358 --> 01:38:19,150
There is no.

733
01:38:33,941 --> 01:38:35,941
I see her ...

734
01:38:36,025 --> 01:38:41,024
- I see her in the mirror. - How does she look?

735
01:38:52,524 --> 01:38:55,482
I see exactly what she looks like ...

736
01:38:55,565 --> 01:39:01,606
I see exactly how she looks. Face.

737
01:39:02,982 --> 01:39:08,732
Can you describe how she looks?

738
01:39:38,564 --> 01:39:41,064
The one I have seen.

739
01:39:41,147 --> 01:39:46,689
A nurse. She was in the hospital the first night, Joseph was hospitalized.

740
01:39:51,855 --> 01:39:56,731
- Take a number and move it forward a little. - Okay.

741
01:39:56,814 --> 01:39:59,188
There. Wait.

742
01:40:02,356 --> 01:40:08,980
There she is. So we check. Take-General a little further along.

743
01:40:09,064 --> 01:40:14,522
Take the left. Take the setter. And then another angle.

744
01:40:14,605 --> 01:40:18,980
It is. And then run.

745
01:40:20,689 --> 01:40:23,855
There.

746
01:40:27,398 --> 01:40:32,605
Print it. So we must have a copy of the complete file of this sequence.

747
01:40:32,688 --> 01:40:35,355
Do you have a USB port?

748
01:40:42,272 --> 01:40:45,688
You want a break?

749
01:40:47,979 --> 01:40:50,271
No.

750
01:40:52,396 --> 01:40:58,229
- It sounded like that. - I understand that you thought it.

751
01:40:58,311 --> 01:41:00,895
I had earned.

752
01:41:00,979 --> 01:41:05,687
I do not even live up to my own expectations more.

753
01:41:05,771 --> 01:41:07,229
Hold up.

754
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:10,437
If I had not taken all the pills ...

755
01:41:10,521 --> 01:41:12,978
Hold up.

756
01:41:23,311 --> 01:41:27,853
If only I could hear his voice ...

757
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:32,520
If I could just hear his voice.

758
01:41:32,603 --> 01:41:36,478
Erik ... Sweet Erik ...

759
01:41:55,602 --> 01:41:59,853
Call from 10th Person Wanted.

760
01:41:59,935 --> 01:42:05,560
- It's Lydia Evers, born ... - Look! It's her.

761
01:42:05,644 --> 01:42:09,102
- What do you think? - It is she who hire of B_rje.

762
01:42:09,185 --> 01:42:12,227
It's damn her!

763
01:42:30,352 --> 01:42:33,477
We go now. There's a plane in an hour.

764
01:43:00,810 --> 01:43:05,768
She moved into B_rjes house by the lake and paid manifest cash.

765
01:43:05,851 --> 01:43:11,183
- Has she been seen with the boy? - No, she keeps to herself.

766
01:43:11,268 --> 01:43:17,601
- Yes. When will we gain? - A patrol will be here in half an hour.

767
01:43:17,684 --> 01:43:21,683
1038 to 1442. Switch.

768
01:43:21,768 --> 01:43:26,893
- from 1038 to 1442, change. - The 1442nd I listen. Switch.

769
01:43:26,975 --> 01:43:31,225
- Where have you gone? - We're still at the station.

770
01:43:31,309 --> 01:43:34,350
- How many do you have? - Two, so that ...

771
01:43:34,434 --> 01:43:37,767
- We come in five to. - Hurry up.

772
01:43:37,851 --> 01:43:42,767
- I do not wait. I'm leaving. - We go with you.

773
01:43:42,850 --> 01:43:44,350
Okay.

774
01:43:45,433 --> 01:43:51,099
We go and check it out. Stay here and wait for reinforcements.

775
01:44:23,307 --> 01:44:26,265
We must go down.

776
01:44:41,807 --> 01:44:44,223
Wait there.

777
01:46:10,347 --> 01:46:12,846
Quiet. He sleeps.

778
01:46:17,222 --> 01:46:20,221
Lydia?

779
01:46:20,305 --> 01:46:27,138
- What are you doing here? - My name is Joona. I'm a cop.

780
01:46:27,222 --> 01:46:32,220
I'm here to help Benjamin. He is sick.

781
01:46:32,304 --> 01:46:39,346
- He needs medicine. - He is not sick. It is my son.

782
01:46:40,888 --> 01:46:45,554
Lydia, he is sick and must be hospitalized.

783
01:46:45,638 --> 01:46:50,303
- I know well, if he is sick. - He's not your son, Lydia.

784
01:46:50,387 --> 01:46:55,846
Listen to me. Your son named Joseph.

785
01:46:59,970 --> 01:47:04,888
- Look at me. Look at me, Lydia. - Where is Joseph?

786
01:47:04,970 --> 01:47:07,845
- Josef is also sick. - Where is Joseph?

787
01:47:07,928 --> 01:47:12,638
- He's in Stockholm. - What's he doing in Stockholm?

788
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:15,845
- We can get him here. - I want Joseph.

789
01:47:15,928 --> 01:47:19,844
- They fly him here. - I just want to have my child.

790
01:47:19,928 --> 01:47:23,470
I want Joseph brought here.

791
01:47:23,552 --> 01:47:27,761
- No, no! - Listen to me. Look at me!

792
01:47:27,844 --> 01:47:33,387
No, no, no. Where is Joseph? I want my baby!

793
01:47:33,469 --> 01:47:37,345
- He should be here now! - Add the weapon from you now!

794
01:47:45,177 --> 01:47:47,136
He was bad.

795
01:48:08,801 --> 01:48:11,552
- Stop! - Help! Mom!

796
01:48:11,635 --> 01:48:14,468
Shut up!

797
01:48:21,552 --> 01:48:24,302
- Mom! - No ...

798
01:48:56,675 --> 01:48:59,009
Come on!

799
01:49:14,591 --> 01:49:19,467
Damn! Come, come, come!

800
01:49:19,550 --> 01:49:22,175
Benjamin!

801
01:49:31,633 --> 01:49:33,174
Lydia!

802
01:49:35,883 --> 01:49:38,549
- Benjamin! - Benjamin!

803
01:49:38,633 --> 01:49:42,384
- Stay with me! - Open the door!

804
01:49:43,466 --> 01:49:45,841
Open the door!

805
01:49:45,925 --> 01:49:49,841
- Let go of me! - Benjamin!

806
01:49:49,924 --> 01:49:54,216
Benjamin, ran back! Running up!

807
01:49:54,299 --> 01:49:57,882
- No! Benjamin! - Mother!

808
01:49:57,966 --> 01:50:00,758
Benjamin!

809
01:50:00,842 --> 01:50:04,049
No! No!

810
01:50:08,549 --> 01:50:10,508
Benjamin!

811
01:50:33,298 --> 01:50:36,548
Well, Benjamin! Backwards!

812
01:50:36,632 --> 01:50:39,172
- Benjamin! - No! No!

813
01:50:40,797 --> 01:50:44,757
Benjamin!

814
01:51:00,214 --> 01:51:05,548
No. Do not leave me!

815
01:51:09,839 --> 01:51:11,964
Fight!

816
01:51:17,797 --> 01:51:19,339
No!

817
01:51:22,631 --> 01:51:24,922
Take my hand!

818
01:51:26,921 --> 01:51:30,714
- Get Benjamin out! - Release taken in him!

819
01:51:30,796 --> 01:51:33,380
Stop!

820
01:51:33,463 --> 01:51:36,213
- Let go of him! - No!

821
01:51:38,381 --> 01:51:41,838
We have to get out of here!

822
01:51:41,922 --> 01:51:47,380
Benjamin! Here. Come! Spring!

823
01:51:51,881 --> 01:51:57,421
Take my hand! Take my hand! The bus is sinking!

824
01:51:57,505 --> 01:52:04,046
Take it! Lydia, take my hand! Lydia!

825
01:52:05,338 --> 01:52:09,671
Joona! Here!

826
01:53:36,919 --> 01:53:41,628
You, Benjamin ... Does it taste good?

827
01:53:41,710 --> 01:53:44,378
Hot.

828
01:54:02,668 --> 01:54:09,085
A message to our customers: Today, Christmas Eve, we close at. 15th

829
01:54:17,709 --> 01:54:23,917
I'm working on getting hold of them. I need relief.

830
01:54:24,002 --> 01:54:28,751
Hey, Magdalena. Merry Christmas.

831
01:54:28,835 --> 01:54:34,750
I sit in the car and eat. Yes. Are you home?

832
01:54:34,834 --> 01:54:38,085
I would get by with anything.

833
01:54:38,166 --> 01:54:40,666
4912, you stand in line ...

834
01:54:59,875 --> 01:55:03,626
- Hello. Merry Christmas. - Good July Sorry to interrupt.

835
01:55:03,708 --> 01:55:07,417
- I just wanted to give it to the ropes. - No, but ...

836
01:55:07,501 --> 01:55:10,667
- Mom! - However, little friend ...

837
01:55:10,750 --> 01:55:16,209
I'm sorry. Were you scared? It was just a Christmas crown.

838
01:55:16,291 --> 01:55:20,917
- Come on in, Joona. Come in. - I do not know ... Sorry.

839
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:24,874
I did not mean for you to be afraid.
